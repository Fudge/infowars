[00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:06.827]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:15.298]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:16.979]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:18.860]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.301]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:21.982]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:26.265]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:30.928]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.916]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:58.851]  Another live edition of the Alex Jones Show, and I really am blessed to be your host, to be on the air, to be fighting the New World Order, to be exposing the globalists and their criminal activities.
[00:01:00.832 --> 00:01:06.657]  I am blown away by the level of corruption, the sheer evil
[00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:24.350]  of the New World Order and its minions and to watch them stage events to really know that there is an Illuminati that the Bilderberg Group and the CFR are their quasi-governmental bodies to see the
[00:01:25.402 --> 00:01:45.796]  New World Order carry out its eugenics against all of us, to watch the general public unaware of how they're under attack, and how they're being destroyed, and to watch the family being dismantled, and the sovereignty of countries being destroyed, it's amazing.
[00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:51.580]  I had some guests on today, several great guests, but I canceled both of them.
[00:01:53.818 --> 00:02:01.022]  And I'm going to make an attempt, as best I can, to cover this news.
[00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:09.807]  I took off a couple days last week, something I haven't done in several years.
[00:02:11.628 --> 00:02:22.254]  And, of course, while I was doing that, major news broke, so I did some live 30-minute pieces on air.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.324]  And then getting back into the office last night and spending several hours looking at what had developed.
[00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:37.288]  The New World Order is in high gear, so we'll get into all of it when we get back.
[00:02:37.608 --> 00:02:38.309]  And you know something?
[00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.252]  I'm glad I spent several days last week talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:02:44.753 --> 00:02:49.516]  Because in and of itself, it's a diversion, it's a distraction.
[00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:53.899]  Arnold himself is nothing but an illusion.
[00:02:55.706 --> 00:03:21.183]  But the forces around him and how the media has handled this, and what the Simon Wiesenthal Center has done, and the Bilderberg Group slash Rothschild-Bohemian Grove axis that's now coming out concerning Arnold and Warren Buffett and how it ties into the situation up in Franklin.
[00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:26.955]  It's all coming up, and yes, it's starting to happen.
[00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:28.515]  I remember this last year.
[00:03:28.555 --> 00:03:29.655]  I remember mentioning it.
[00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:32.116]  I'd forgotten about it, and here it is.
[00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:44.699]  We've posted, or are posting, on InfoWars.com, Reuters, and also an Associated Press article, and it's
[00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:59.230]  Ladison Manor, England, Reuters, the world's second richest man dropped into the English countryside with the Terminator at its side on Monday, a day after warning the UK's corporate big game has elephant gun was loaded.
[00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:07.155]  And it says billionaire Warren Buffett and the mean machine Arnold Schwarzenegger touched down by helicopter on the immaculate lawn of
[00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:15.751]  Waddesdon Manor, a Renaissance-style chateau in the undulating hills of Buckinghamshire.
[00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:23.333]  And it says that they were both guests for the weekend with the world's elite, with the Rothschild family.
[00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:37.597]  And I remember, this was in the British News last year, because they were complaining, you know, these Rothschilds have all the elite fly in, they openly decide policy for Europe, and don't care what the people want.
[00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:42.422]  This was in their news last year, and I remember seeing that Arne was in attendance.
[00:04:43.562 --> 00:04:47.465]  These guys go to Bohemian Grove, they go to Rothschild Castles.
[00:04:47.485 --> 00:04:58.372]  Of course, old Stanley Kubrick tried to make a movie about that, and there was a big news article how he was fighting with the distributors, saying, you're not going to cut scenes out.
[00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:06.417]  Well, he had a little heart attack the day after, and it did get cut out, but a lot goes on at the old Rothschild Castles.
[00:05:06.517 --> 00:05:07.258]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.492 --> 00:05:15.739]  It's here, and Ted Anderson from Midas Resources wants to be sure you call right now and get yours today.

[00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:17.430]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.091]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:37.917]  Alright my friends, we're now 8 minutes and 30 seconds into the first hour of this show.
[00:08:40.234 --> 00:09:02.595]  And on Friday I was at a car wash getting my car cleaned, and I'm sitting there watching my car go through the cleaning facility, and I was reading a copy of Order Out of Chaos that I published for Paul Joseph Watson, and somebody walks up and says, what's that book about?
[00:09:02.615 --> 00:09:05.958]  And I said, well, it's about the New World Order.
[00:09:06.815 --> 00:09:09.737]  And he goes, yeah, I saw the cover, elite-sponsored terrorism.
[00:09:10.197 --> 00:09:11.038]  What's that mean?
[00:09:11.538 --> 00:09:12.619]  Some middle-aged guy.
[00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:19.063]  And I said, well, it's, you know, how there's an elite and they're trying to set up a global system of control.
[00:09:19.083 --> 00:09:20.184]  And the guy started laughing.
[00:09:21.304 --> 00:09:22.045]  And I go, what's funny?
[00:09:22.085 --> 00:09:24.186]  He goes, oh, global system of control.
[00:09:24.246 --> 00:09:30.610]  I go, you don't think powerful people don't want control and don't want more control?
[00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.172]  That's why they're where they're at in life.
[00:09:33.752 --> 00:09:36.234]  Because they're intelligent, they're ruthless, they're skilled.
[00:09:37.378 --> 00:09:46.844]  And the guy started going, ooh, crazy, doing the universal sign of crazy, where you take your finger and make a circle by the side of your head.
[00:09:46.864 --> 00:09:49.766]  And I said, hey, just enjoy yourself.
[00:09:50.766 --> 00:09:54.008]  And by then, I thought the person knew who I was and was trying to tease me.
[00:09:55.009 --> 00:10:00.272]  And then some lady sitting with her kid says, what are you talking about?
[00:10:00.332 --> 00:10:02.914]  And I go, oh, the New World Order and some of the things they're doing to us.
[00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:05.289]  The Cashless Society Control Grid.
[00:10:05.309 --> 00:10:06.129]  She goes, what's that?
[00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:11.974]  I go, well, I'm sure you've heard on the news that they want to put implantable microchips in us.
[00:10:13.256 --> 00:10:16.959]  And she started laughing, and then I looked behind me and the guy was making the crazy sign again.
[00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:18.680]  And I said, now wait a minute, ma'am.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.886]  Have you or have you not heard how they want to put microchips in us, and how they want to put them in the children so they, quote, can't get kidnapped?
[00:10:24.986 --> 00:10:27.108]  And she goes, yeah, I've heard about that.
[00:10:27.388 --> 00:10:30.651]  But still, you're kind of weird, aren't you, talking about it.
[00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:35.184]  I mean, I was looking at a George Orwell victim.
[00:10:35.204 --> 00:10:37.947]  I was looking at one of the double thinkers.
[00:10:38.267 --> 00:10:54.480]  She admits that she knows it's on the news and has heard it, but I'm weird because I'm in a business, you know, it's a long line of chairs along where the trucks and vehicles drive through and get cleaned.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.221]  You've all been in them.
[00:10:56.902 --> 00:10:59.124]  And somebody asked me what I'm reading.
[00:10:59.184 --> 00:10:59.965]  I'm nice to them.
[00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:02.780]  And I'm looking at victims.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:26.473]  I'm looking at little bug-eyed victims who are so petty and so small-minded that to them, you're trying to be uppity, you're trying to be aggressive, you're trying to get in their space just by telling them that there's a powerful elite who, by the way, are into eugenics and want to micromanage and control you and dumb you down and get rid of you.
[00:11:29.241 --> 00:11:30.162]  So I'm bad.
[00:11:30.542 --> 00:11:49.618]  I'm bad, folks, because I'm looking at a Reuters article from last year being posted on Infowars.com right now with a photo of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Warren Buffett getting off a private jet, walking into the ancestral home of the Rothschilds to meet with the Rothschilds.
[00:11:50.278 --> 00:11:54.342]  And then I went back to the news article from that date and remember seeing that Arnold was there.
[00:11:55.757 --> 00:12:05.922]  We talked about how the British people were upset, saying we're sick of the Rothschilds running our lives, meeting out at their castle with the Masons and the royalty and the bankers.
[00:12:05.982 --> 00:12:08.183]  I mean, there were a bunch of articles about this.
[00:12:08.443 --> 00:12:09.684]  People are sick of it.
[00:12:09.924 --> 00:12:21.330]  They're tired of 80-plus percent of the people being against national ID cards, 80-plus percent being against the Euro, and the Rothschilds control the media and the government and say, we don't care what you want, you're going to have it.
[00:12:24.531 --> 00:12:33.136]  So Arnold, when he's not at Bilderberg group meetings or at Rothschild castles, he's out at Bohemian Grove and so he's allowed to say I admire Hitler.
[00:12:33.356 --> 00:12:51.105]  He's allowed to say I love Kurt Voltheim, the UN Secretary General and Austrian President who ran extermination centers in Serbia during the war against Serb patriots with the Croats and Muslims, killing the Serb Christians, of course.
[00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:58.258]  And so he can do whatever he wants, but Mel Gibson was faced with a total ban of his movie in the U.S.
[00:12:58.558 --> 00:12:59.660]  There is no First Amendment.
[00:13:00.721 --> 00:13:08.813]  Mel Gibson's head of his production company is here stating that, well, we just use the Bible word for word, but we are going to cut it all out under threats.
[00:13:09.805 --> 00:13:14.986]  And we're not going to show the Pharisees ordering Christ's death, even though it's word for word out of the Bible.
[00:13:15.606 --> 00:13:23.628]  And they're capitulating and re-editing the film right now, because Rabbi Hare said that they were going to boycott and stop the film from airing in the U.S.
[00:13:25.268 --> 00:13:26.668]  And so, that's your freedom.
[00:13:26.968 --> 00:13:34.970]  You can have a guy who loves Hitler, who is a Nazi, who goes to Rothschild castles, by the way, and he's
[00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:37.862]  He's untouchable, folks.
[00:13:38.503 --> 00:13:39.764]  Arnold can do whatever he wants.
[00:13:39.784 --> 00:13:41.745]  He can smoke marijuana on TV.
[00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:47.310]  He can talk about how he loves to have sex with hundreds of women on TV.
[00:13:47.871 --> 00:13:52.775]  He can talk about how he loves Hitler and how he admires Adolf Hitler and how he wants to control people.
[00:13:52.795 --> 00:13:54.576]  I've conquered bodybuilding.
[00:13:54.636 --> 00:13:56.838]  I've conquered acting.
[00:13:56.858 --> 00:13:58.200]  Now I want to conquer people.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.401]  I love those that always control people.
[00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:02.763]  I mean, he's on the record, folks.
[00:14:03.024 --> 00:14:04.425]  He's on film saying
[00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:07.281]  In a documentary, I admire Adolf Hitler.
[00:14:07.461 --> 00:14:08.041]  And you know what?
[00:14:08.262 --> 00:14:09.382]  The Rothschilds love him.
[00:14:09.863 --> 00:14:11.344]  Simon Wiesenthal, Senator, loves him.
[00:14:11.544 --> 00:14:16.508]  But you make a good, decent film about Jesus Christ, you're shut down.
[00:14:17.289 --> 00:14:18.750]  You're starting to figure this out, folks.
[00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:22.393]  And Arnold has announced, yeah, he'll probably raise taxes.
[00:14:22.433 --> 00:14:25.916]  Warren Buffett's the big Democrat, up there in Nebraska.
[00:14:28.798 --> 00:14:29.679]  It's sick, folks.
[00:14:29.759 --> 00:14:34.263]  It's such a great illustration here of everything we're facing.
[00:14:37.155 --> 00:14:40.864]  And so, I mean, Arnold could be a
[00:14:43.872 --> 00:14:48.554]  Arnold could be a pumpkin with wings, and if the media said vote for him, it would happen.
[00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:53.235]  And they're hyping him, they're lavishing praise, they're ignoring all the other candidates.
[00:14:53.596 --> 00:14:55.956]  He is the official candidate for Governor of California.
[00:14:56.317 --> 00:15:00.678]  As if it even matters, they're putting in touchscreen election systems all over the country.
[00:15:01.098 --> 00:15:02.379]  They're getting rid of the sovereignty.
[00:15:02.499 --> 00:15:06.780]  They're about to vote for blanket total amnesty for all illegals in perpetuity.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.361]  Whoever can get here is legal.
[00:15:11.795 --> 00:15:12.775]  It's all a sick joke.
[00:15:13.056 --> 00:15:14.156]  I mean, look at California.
[00:15:14.596 --> 00:15:16.137]  It's the model of the New World Order.
[00:15:16.417 --> 00:15:24.560]  Blowing out the economy, raising taxes, falling standard of living, the power plants are even leaving, moving south of the border.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:26.881]  It's a joke.
[00:15:27.241 --> 00:15:28.441]  And that's exactly what they want.
[00:15:29.041 --> 00:15:33.983]  They'll just give you a puppet, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and it'll be a big theater for you.
[00:15:34.544 --> 00:15:40.906]  And you see, people can't... Westerners, raised by television and movies, can't even
[00:15:41.997 --> 00:15:42.998]  Interface now.
[00:15:43.618 --> 00:15:51.724]  Can't even deal now with reality.
[00:15:52.124 --> 00:16:03.532]  They really think Arnold is this deadly guy with a machine gun and can kill 50 guys in a room with his bare hands.
[00:16:04.593 --> 00:16:05.633]  It's sick, folks.
[00:16:06.094 --> 00:16:07.575]  It's so ridiculous.
[00:16:09.446 --> 00:16:19.633]  And the media is merging his films with the race, and you're like, Alex, we know it's a joke, we know it's a diversion, but it's a great teaching tool, folks.
[00:16:19.693 --> 00:16:24.396]  I mean, here is Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I got a bunch of other news we're about to get to, but let me just read this article.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.860]  Wadsden Manor.
[00:16:32.021 --> 00:16:35.223]  England Reuters, the world's second richest man, which is totally untrue.
[00:16:35.283 --> 00:16:37.525]  He's low-level, folks, but a top manager.
[00:16:38.504 --> 00:16:47.827]  The world's second-richest man dropped into the English countryside with a Puma native at his side on Monday, a day after warning the UK corporate big game his elephant gun was loaded.
[00:16:48.368 --> 00:17:02.453]  Billionaire Warren Buffett and mean machine Arnold Schwarzenegger touched down by helicopter on the immaculate lawns of Waddesdon Manor, a Renaissance-style chateau in the undulating hills of Buckinghamshire.
[00:17:02.893 --> 00:17:05.634]  That's near where Stanley Kubrick lived.
[00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:17.578]  Buffett, 72, is guest of honor at the closed two-day meeting of some of the world's most powerful businessmen and financiers, the ultimate networking opportunity.
[00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:22.802]  The get-together is at the ancestral home of the Rothschild banking family.
[00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:26.424]  We'll discuss economic and political issues, the organization said.
[00:17:27.445 --> 00:17:33.930]  But Buffett's remark made in the weekend newspaper interview that he is looking for a big deal in Britain has stolen the agenda.
[00:17:34.696 --> 00:17:35.817]  We're hunting for elephant.
[00:17:36.157 --> 00:17:37.537]  We have got the elephant gun.
[00:17:37.597 --> 00:17:39.958]  It is loaded, Buffett told the Sunday Telegraph.
[00:17:40.619 --> 00:17:42.299]  And for those that don't know, they use fronts.
[00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:45.101]  The Rothschilds use fronts like Buffett and Soros.
[00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:48.582]  This is admitted, by the way, in the Financial Times of London.
[00:17:49.122 --> 00:17:57.426]  As their front, to come in and badmouth certain stocks, badmouth certain currencies, to bring down economies so the Rothschilds can consolidate.
[00:17:59.727 --> 00:18:00.848]  Among those invited to
[00:18:02.518 --> 00:18:14.122]  Waddesdon Manor, where the likes of James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, Jorma Olia, chief executive of Nokia, and De Beers chairman, Nicky Oppenheimer.
[00:18:14.542 --> 00:18:21.925]  Oh, the folks with the World Diamond Monopoly, who just ordered all the invasions of the Gold Coast in the name of helping the Africans.
[00:18:22.265 --> 00:18:31.188]  Of course, three years ago they bragged in the New Yorker magazine, the Oppenheimers did, we'll be invading Africa in the name of humanitarian issues in the next year to get control of the diamond monopoly again.
[00:18:32.668 --> 00:18:43.396]  The Schwarzenegger was on the guest list conference brought by Buffett's Breckshire Hathaway, or Rothschild Front.
[00:18:43.737 --> 00:18:52.904]  This year's stock market carnage is made for Buffett, the billionaire oracle of Omaha, Nebraska, a godsend for firms who need cash quickly.
[00:18:53.364 --> 00:18:59.709]  He has more than $7 billion in cash on hand, which is just what... It's about what they make in an hour on the currency market, folks.
[00:19:01.121 --> 00:19:03.182]  And can set up an ironclad deals in a day.
[00:19:03.202 --> 00:19:06.582]  His philosophy is simple, and it goes on.
[00:19:08.043 --> 00:19:21.246]  A group of photographers captured the moment when Buffett and Schwarzenegger, resplendent in steel-tipped cowboy boots, stepped onto the freshly cut lawn and greeted by Lord Jacob Rothschild.
[00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:23.567]  His very nice view
[00:19:29.111 --> 00:19:36.756]  Well, there you have it!
[00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:40.478]  Lord Rothschild, so good to meet you!
[00:19:41.979 --> 00:19:53.506]  Before you become Federal Reserve Chairman, a Governor of California, a President, a CEO of Fortune 500, you always take a visit to Rothschild Castle.
[00:19:54.796 --> 00:19:59.938]  In Burgundy, in Toulouse, or in England.
[00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:02.999]  Burgundy and Toulouse are in France.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.141]  Nearby areas where, well, they found some interesting things buried.
[00:20:07.161 --> 00:20:07.721]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:11.508 --> 00:20:16.010]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:16.351 --> 00:20:20.453]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:20.733 --> 00:20:21.293]  We listened.
[00:20:21.593 --> 00:20:26.576]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:26.856 --> 00:20:27.336]  We listened.
[00:20:27.716 --> 00:20:30.758]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:31.178 --> 00:20:31.718]  We listened.
[00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:35.060]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:35.220]  Yes.
[00:21:02.077 --> 00:21:03.879]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.963]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:22:09.236 --> 00:22:14.140]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a roadmap, and how easy it would be to get lost?
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.821]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[00:22:15.841 --> 00:22:18.183]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[00:22:18.623 --> 00:22:21.465]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[00:22:21.505 --> 00:22:21.845]  coins.
[00:22:22.106 --> 00:22:23.367]  The Redbook Guide to U.S.

[00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:29.931]  gold and silver coins.

[00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:09.882]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:23:10.042 --> 00:23:10.642]  I mean real.
[00:23:10.862 --> 00:23:15.685]  Hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials.
[00:23:16.025 --> 00:23:16.865]  Probably never, right?
[00:23:17.145 --> 00:23:20.207]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.
[00:23:20.487 --> 00:23:22.908]  He's the owner and founder of the Cal Bend Soap Company.

[00:24:04.104 --> 00:24:06.946]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:24:19.562 --> 00:24:43.177]  All right, I'm about to shift gears over into other news, but come on folks, Arnold Schwarzenegger for 20 years attending the Bohemian Rove encampment, the occult meeting house of heads of major countries, presidents, prime ministers, German chancellors, and last year in September they land
[00:24:47.216 --> 00:24:55.183]  At the Rothschild compound, and Arnold and Warren Buffett are met by the head of the Rothschild banking family.
[00:24:57.145 --> 00:24:58.426]  This is our country, folks.
[00:24:58.466 --> 00:24:59.386]  This is America.
[00:24:59.486 --> 00:25:00.647]  This is a sick joke.
[00:25:02.349 --> 00:25:04.511]  And it's just absolutely amazing.
[00:25:04.531 --> 00:25:06.953]  It shows how far we've gone down.
[00:25:08.074 --> 00:25:09.935]  And for the average person, they have no idea.
[00:25:10.055 --> 00:25:11.837]  And look at who's pulling the strings for them.
[00:25:14.671 --> 00:25:16.813]  Hatch for foreign-born hopefuls.
[00:25:16.853 --> 00:25:19.075]  We read this Associated Press article last week.
[00:25:19.896 --> 00:25:28.944]  Orrin Hatch has introduced a bill to repeal the constitutional provision that stops someone who's foreign-born from being president.
[00:25:29.305 --> 00:25:36.111]  Because you could have, it says here in the article, foreign-born agents taking over the country.
[00:25:37.668 --> 00:25:41.676]  Says the restriction has become an anachronism that is decidedly un-American hatch.
[00:25:41.696 --> 00:25:46.786]  The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said one time presidential candidate said when he introduced the change last week.
[00:25:47.398 --> 00:25:57.541]  A retired University of Alabama history professor, Forrest McDonald, said the prohibition made sense when it was included in the Constitution, and I'm not sure the reasoning is entirely outdated.
[00:25:57.581 --> 00:26:08.865]  He said that 15 years before the Constitution was written, foreign operatives from Russia, Prussia, and Austria, oh, Austria, conspired to get a favorable monarch elected to lead Poland.
[00:26:09.005 --> 00:26:12.226]  Once in place, the country was divided up among the three powers.
[00:26:12.975 --> 00:26:17.176]  The American fathers were acutely sensitive to the prospect, McDonald said.
[00:26:17.196 --> 00:26:24.898]  And he said it is not inconceivable that something like this could happen today.
[00:26:25.458 --> 00:26:26.478]  It doesn't matter, folks.
[00:26:26.498 --> 00:26:34.660]  You can get plenty of Benedict Arnolds who were born in the country, like the Bushes, who have been on the Nazi bankroll since well before 1940.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.321]  By the way, we've reposted some United Press International articles
[00:26:42.453 --> 00:26:49.057]  On PrisonPlanet.com, where the Bush's were running the major Nazi operations in the U.S.
[00:26:50.738 --> 00:26:54.060]  But let's shift gears out of that and get into some other really serious stuff.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.561]  We'll talk about the power outages.
[00:26:55.581 --> 00:26:57.842]  We'll talk about a bunch of new gun control.
[00:26:58.763 --> 00:27:00.183]  But here's just some of the news I've got.
[00:27:00.924 --> 00:27:01.284]  Court!
[00:27:01.504 --> 00:27:05.506]  Fake checkpoints okay in search for motorist illegal drugs.
[00:27:07.307 --> 00:27:09.829]  So now, we'll just wait until we get to that.
[00:27:10.612 --> 00:27:16.996]  Inside the resistance, the United States likes to think that all the confronts in Iraq are a few die-hard Saddamists.
[00:27:17.577 --> 00:27:22.480]  But Paul McGaugh meets a new guerrilla movement with growing popular support.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.801]  So we'll get into that situation.
[00:27:26.462 --> 00:27:29.864]  Also, miracle birth signals male moms.
[00:27:29.945 --> 00:27:31.646]  That's right.
[00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:33.627]  And we'll be getting to that.
[00:27:33.647 --> 00:27:34.768]  It's mainstream news.
[00:27:35.648 --> 00:27:36.629]  Open mail out of Canada.
[00:27:37.129 --> 00:27:39.711]  Europe announces more nano-creations.
[00:27:40.473 --> 00:27:42.675]  Interesting science news on nanotechnology.
[00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:46.298]  Human rabbit embryos intensifies stem cell debate.
[00:27:47.278 --> 00:27:50.441]  They have little embryos that are half rabbit, half human.
[00:27:51.341 --> 00:27:54.744]  This is the type of stuff that's going on, but again, it doesn't really matter.
[00:27:55.244 --> 00:28:01.009]  And they're putting all sorts of weird chimera genetics into our food chain, but hey, that's alright.
[00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:10.782]  And there's official World Bank IMF documents where they want to forcibly sterilize all of us, and that just so happens to be happening now all over the planet.
[00:28:11.102 --> 00:28:15.343]  Sperm rates and female fertility plunge, but that's okay.
[00:28:15.403 --> 00:28:20.004]  And Ashcroft says, MSNBC, they call this an exclusive, folks.
[00:28:21.044 --> 00:28:24.625]  Exclusive Ashcroft campaign to shore up the Patriot Act.
[00:28:25.885 --> 00:28:27.145]  This just came out over the weekend.
[00:28:27.185 --> 00:28:30.066]  It's coming out in their August 25th issue.
[00:28:33.704 --> 00:28:35.145]  And of course, it's the 18th right now.
[00:28:35.165 --> 00:28:36.406]  This hasn't even come out yet.
[00:28:36.426 --> 00:28:41.809]  It comes out in a few days, and that is in the paper, physical form.
[00:28:46.432 --> 00:28:49.875]  So, this is very, very interesting.
[00:28:50.475 --> 00:28:56.679]  Attorney General John Ashcroft this week will launch a cross-country brainstorming tour designed to shore up support for the USA Patriot Act.
[00:28:57.179 --> 00:28:59.281]  The controversial measure passes through September 11th.
[00:29:00.228 --> 00:29:02.769]  The Justice Department brought new power to combat terrorism.
[00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:10.494]  You mean to combat the slaves, the population that might not submit to the horrible stuff you've got planned right around the corner?
[00:29:10.514 --> 00:29:13.455]  This is all just preparation, isn't it, you little puppet?
[00:29:14.796 --> 00:29:25.622]  And now he's proposed the Victory Act, which we've got the text of, the draft of, and that's posted, or being posted, it's a big update today, it'll take a while, on InfoWars.com.
[00:29:27.203 --> 00:29:29.064]  So we'll get into that, too, when we get back.
[00:29:29.824 --> 00:29:40.150]  Again, Gibson says he has softened Crucifixion Story, a new Jesus movie, and taken the direct passage from the Bible out under demands by the Thought Police here.
[00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.431]  Gibson, you're not a Nazi!
[00:29:42.991 --> 00:29:44.432]  You didn't say you loved Hitler!
[00:29:45.133 --> 00:29:47.954]  And you love Jesus, so you can't have your movie, okay?
[00:29:48.394 --> 00:29:52.917]  If you were a Bilderberg group Nazi, you'd be just fine.
[00:29:54.158 --> 00:29:55.759]  The Rothschilds are Nazis.
[00:29:55.939 --> 00:29:58.040]  We'll be right back with a lot more.
[00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:01.311]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.771 --> 00:30:03.412]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.292 --> 00:30:07.053]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.435 --> 00:30:14.737]  Every cell of the body has a receptor site for our master hormone called growth hormone.
[00:30:15.137 --> 00:30:18.219]  The role of growth hormone is to instruct the cells to repair.
[00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:20.960]  This hormone is in the highest concentrations in the body.
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:21.020]  888-803-4438.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:21.801]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:30:21.861 --> 00:30:23.101]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:30:43.297 --> 00:30:45.659]  Alright, your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:45.739]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:45.820]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:30:57.314 --> 00:31:06.683]  Later in the next hour, I do have comments about this Reuters article about Arnold Schwarzenegger being spirited by Warren Buffett off to the Rothschild Castle.
[00:31:08.005 --> 00:31:12.529]  And there are similar articles for Bill Clinton before he even ran for president.
[00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.172]  And everybody else.
[00:31:15.272 --> 00:31:20.557]  I mean, it really is sick to be controlled by agents of this criminal family.
[00:31:21.681 --> 00:31:28.383]  In my film, Police State 3, by the way, Total Enslavement, Police State 3, Total Enslavement gets into that situation.
[00:31:30.303 --> 00:31:37.165]  But all these other articles, I mean, there are so many.
[00:31:38.586 --> 00:31:39.506]  Where do you start?
[00:31:39.546 --> 00:31:41.567]  Where does it all end?
[00:31:41.587 --> 00:31:49.029]  There's so much tyranny and so much evil going on.
[00:31:49.609 --> 00:31:50.289]  Listen to this.
[00:31:51.067 --> 00:31:56.750]  Court fake checkpoints okay in search for motorist illegal drugs.
[00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:02.492]  Colorado police can set up fake checkpoints in hopes of sniffing out illegal drugs.
[00:32:02.972 --> 00:32:10.496]  An appeals court ruled in a case for camouflage clad officers spied on fans during a bluegrass festival in 2000.
[00:32:11.116 --> 00:32:14.317]  Now folks, this article is doublespeak.
[00:32:15.978 --> 00:32:17.919]  The globalists know that we're honest creatures.
[00:32:18.863 --> 00:32:23.747]  By honest, I mean, we look at things as if they're reality-based.
[00:32:23.807 --> 00:32:25.729]  That's why television is so mesmerizing.
[00:32:27.971 --> 00:32:29.632]  I don't want to get into too much sophistication.
[00:32:29.872 --> 00:32:32.695]  There's no way to articulate how much trouble we're in, folks.
[00:32:33.455 --> 00:32:36.278]  I mean, I can't even read the news articles now.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.322]  Court rules that you can have fake checkpoints, and it says that
[00:32:42.685 --> 00:32:50.707]  That the military type police just search everybody and they go, well it doesn't violate the fourth amendment because it's a fake checkpoint.
[00:32:52.787 --> 00:32:54.468]  That's double speak, double think.
[00:32:54.728 --> 00:32:57.348]  That's not even reality based.
[00:32:58.028 --> 00:33:01.509]  This is so over the top I could spend all day on this trying to break it down.
[00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:09.091]  They're training us how to not think rationally, how to be a nation of basically mentally ill idiots.
[00:33:11.107 --> 00:33:16.329]  Because, I mean, I read the article this morning, spent like 20 minutes on this one article just reading and then going, what?
[00:33:19.391 --> 00:33:22.312]  It doesn't even, oh man, I don't even know how to, oh.
[00:33:24.573 --> 00:33:29.656]  It says they search the people but it doesn't violate their rights because they're dubbing them fake checkpoints.
[00:33:30.096 --> 00:33:31.556]  What does that mean?
[00:33:33.877 --> 00:33:36.099]  See, it's all form over substance.
[00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:39.120]  It's like Arnold, pro-abortion, open borders, wants
[00:33:39.933 --> 00:33:43.276]  He's pro-CPS taking kids and giving them to homosexual families.
[00:33:44.177 --> 00:33:46.199]  That's the California initiative he supports.
[00:33:46.899 --> 00:33:48.461]  He's for raising taxes.
[00:33:49.501 --> 00:33:51.443]  The guy says he doesn't like Jesus Christ.
[00:33:51.643 --> 00:33:52.544]  He's on video saying it.
[00:33:52.844 --> 00:33:53.825]  He loves Hitler.
[00:33:54.206 --> 00:33:56.027]  Smoking marijuana on TV.
[00:33:57.649 --> 00:33:58.489]  In a documentary!
[00:34:00.351 --> 00:34:02.032]  But, oh, that's conservatism!
[00:34:02.092 --> 00:34:04.895]  I have to see all the neocons up there pushing him!
[00:34:06.076 --> 00:34:07.337]  And the liberals defending him.
[00:34:09.022 --> 00:34:16.204]  Again, it just... The guy says he loves Hitler, so the ADL and the Rothschilds love him.
[00:34:16.324 --> 00:34:17.585]  Which is, by the way, the Rothschilds.
[00:34:17.605 --> 00:34:18.605]  Hitler was a Rothschild.
[00:34:19.985 --> 00:34:21.026]  Oh, man.
[00:34:21.546 --> 00:34:22.426]  Oh, man.
[00:34:23.867 --> 00:34:26.467]  I was reading a book by Fritz Springmeier last night.
[00:34:28.348 --> 00:34:29.848]  It's a book we're going to be offering soon.
[00:34:29.948 --> 00:34:30.889]  It's an incredible book.
[00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:34.770]  And he was talking about
[00:34:36.071 --> 00:34:41.256]  You know, how everything you see and the labels you're given isn't really the reality.
[00:34:41.636 --> 00:34:52.326]  And no matter how bizarre this book sounds, I've read so many news articles and watched so much C-SPAN and read so many history books that the whole thing's documented and true!
[00:34:52.706 --> 00:34:58.131]  And it's the most fairy tale, insane, horrible thing you can imagine!
[00:35:02.518 --> 00:35:17.652]  I mean, Rothschilds controlling the Nazis, and the Kabbalah really creating the Nazis, and the whole Nazi movement really being, quote, Jewish.
[00:35:19.213 --> 00:35:21.836]  And you try to tell somebody that, how does it even compute?
[00:35:23.792 --> 00:35:25.233]  But then you've got this illustration!
[00:35:25.453 --> 00:35:27.715]  Dale Gibson makes a movie, word for word, out of the Bible.
[00:35:27.995 --> 00:35:30.257]  It's decried, being shut down, they've edited it now.
[00:35:30.637 --> 00:35:33.099]  Begging to... Okay, can we please show this now?
[00:35:33.179 --> 00:35:33.939]  Is this okay?
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.982]  But then Arnold's running around, I love Hitler!
[00:35:37.002 --> 00:35:38.423]  Ah, my daddy's a Nazi!
[00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:39.604]  I love Kurt Volk!
[00:35:39.884 --> 00:35:40.744]  I'm... Ah-ha!
[00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:41.845]  Ah-ha-ha-ha!
[00:35:42.085 --> 00:35:43.066]  I hate Jesus!
[00:35:46.509 --> 00:35:48.370]  And oh, he's at the Rothschild Castle!
[00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:49.511]  I have the article.
[00:35:50.271 --> 00:35:50.992]  Reuters, right here.
[00:35:52.987 --> 00:36:02.812]  From last year, Reuters, September 24th, 2002, the world's second richest man dropped into the England countryside with a tub of beer.
[00:36:03.252 --> 00:36:04.672]  And it goes into how he was met.
[00:36:04.692 --> 00:36:05.973]  Let me just read the last quote again.
[00:36:07.874 --> 00:36:16.218]  A group of photographers captured the moment when Buffett and Schwarzenegger, resplendent in steel-tipped cowboy boots, stepped onto
[00:36:20.023 --> 00:36:24.725]  Waddeson's freshly cut lawn to be greeted by Lord Jacob Rothschild.
[00:36:27.106 --> 00:36:34.689]  It is very nice of you to host this Schwarzenegger set of the secret two-day meeting with the heads of the World Bank, IMF, you name it.
[00:36:34.709 --> 00:36:35.609]  It's all right here.
[00:36:35.629 --> 00:36:37.350]  I remember this article last year.
[00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:38.530]  I remember a bunch of them.
[00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:43.612]  And they all come out from the meeting, announce the new policies, and everybody follows it.
[00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:52.732]  And I just pause, you know, what does it mean when two men are wearing the same clothes?
[00:36:55.934 --> 00:37:07.779]  They get off the helicopter, there's photos of them here getting off the jet and getting on the helicopter and then flying out to the base, out to the castle.
[00:37:10.241 --> 00:37:11.961]  And see, I've snuck into one of these events.
[00:37:12.422 --> 00:37:15.383]  I was only there on the kickoff of one of these things in Northern California.
[00:37:17.407 --> 00:37:30.699]  And Helmut Schmidt, the German Chancellor, again, before Helmut Kohl, before Gerhard Schroeder, every time I mention Helmut Schmidt I get an email, you idiot, the German Chancellor is Gerhard Schroeder!
[00:37:30.719 --> 00:37:34.062]  Yeah, I know, the communist street thug, I'm talking about 20 years ago.
[00:37:35.623 --> 00:37:39.407]  Helmut Schmidt, in his own book, written by him!
[00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:43.230]  Written by him!
[00:37:46.767 --> 00:37:48.487]  I love the occult rituals at the Grove.
[00:37:48.527 --> 00:37:55.649]  We've got our own Grove in Germany, and our own meeting places in Europe, but I like the Druid rituals we do in Northern California.
[00:37:55.949 --> 00:38:13.292]  I mean, folks, there are German chancellors writing books about Druid rituals, where all the Christian conservative leaders meet, and you've got Arnold flapping around, and they bus in, after jetting him in, the $2,000 an hour male prostitutes, according to the Washington Times.
[00:38:17.515 --> 00:38:26.282]  But Arnold and Buffett, of course the story's about Arnold and how he made his money in Europe, but Arnold and Buffett get off wearing the same little outfit.
[00:38:27.483 --> 00:38:28.564]  They're little friends.
[00:38:30.466 --> 00:38:34.770]  This is all just over the top, out of control.
[00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:41.836]  Folks, you know, again, I'm speechless here.
[00:38:42.696 --> 00:38:44.518]  I really am getting to the point now where
[00:38:46.304 --> 00:38:56.831]  They're all spending hours this morning reading over this news and reading over it last night and I get on the air now and I just... I'm speechless right now.
[00:38:57.531 --> 00:39:13.782]  I just... Castles in Germany, castles in France, castles in England, secret compounds in the Redwoods, people running around naked, male prostitutes everywhere, Satan worship openly,
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.921]  And it's all just good fun.
[00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:27.886]  Oh, it's all just ha-ha-ha, and oh yeah, there's a German death cult at Yale, and most of the CIA directors go there, but you know, it's just fun, and it was... It's all okay.
[00:39:31.548 --> 00:39:35.350]  And don't criticize Hitler for your anti-Semitic now.
[00:39:39.112 --> 00:39:41.333]  I mean, it's all off the charts, folks.
[00:39:43.007 --> 00:39:47.930]  Colorado police can set up fake checkpoints in hopes of sniffing out illegal drugs.
[00:39:49.091 --> 00:39:59.457]  An appeals court ruled in a case where camouflage-clad officers spied on fans during a bluegrass festival in 2000.
[00:40:00.037 --> 00:40:01.438]  And now they've ruled.
[00:40:02.058 --> 00:40:08.182]  Thursday's ruling, which reverts an earlier finding, was based on a federal appeals court decision last year in a similar case in Oklahoma.
[00:40:09.102 --> 00:40:14.988]  Police pulled over Steven Roth 60 for littering after they found a marijuana pipe tossed from the window.
[00:40:15.148 --> 00:40:16.669]  Oh sure, anybody believe that?
[00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:20.193]  Two other pipes and mushrooms are found in the search.
[00:40:20.996 --> 00:40:32.562]  The appeals court said that while drug checkpoints are illegal because motorists are stopped at random and without reasonable suspicion of committing a crime, the discovery of the first pipe gave the officer probable cause to stop Roth's vehicle.
[00:40:32.922 --> 00:40:34.463]  Roth's lawyer said he planned to appeal.
[00:40:34.783 --> 00:40:42.808]  Sheriff Jerry Martin said his department conducted four fake checkpoint operations before suspending them because of the lawsuit.
[00:40:42.828 --> 00:40:45.289]  The operation will probably be reinstated, he said.
[00:40:47.808 --> 00:40:49.249]  Now, I mean, what does that even mean?
[00:40:49.869 --> 00:40:52.411]  It's a fake checkpoint that they stop you and search your car.
[00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:58.394]  And there's more and more... I mean, again, they're practicing this in the news.
[00:40:58.574 --> 00:41:00.555]  Oh, well, the court said it, because it goes on here.
[00:41:02.776 --> 00:41:04.638]  You can have a checkpoint if it's not real.
[00:41:04.818 --> 00:41:09.921]  You just pull them over and search them, but it's not real, so it's not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:41:10.181 --> 00:41:13.082]  See, that's so evil and such a double thing.
[00:41:13.543 --> 00:41:14.063]  How do I...
[00:41:15.234 --> 00:41:17.496]  Don't you get that's not right, folks?
[00:41:18.858 --> 00:41:19.799]  It is a checkpoint.
[00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:23.584]  But they say no, it's not.
[00:41:24.385 --> 00:41:29.691]  By the way, they're going to put not just cameras in all the school systems, not just Louisiana or Texas or New York.
[00:41:30.312 --> 00:41:32.575]  All the schools are going to get cameras watching the kids.
[00:41:34.145 --> 00:41:38.550]  Now parents to come get their kids have to have a school approved ID card.
[00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:42.874]  Of course, once we all have our national ID card, you swipe the card, they won't let you have your kid.
[00:41:42.954 --> 00:41:46.018]  Oh, the police have to talk to you first, taking control of your children.
[00:41:46.038 --> 00:41:51.944]  They're going to put state police on the school buses, further training your kids, they're prisoners.
[00:41:52.445 --> 00:41:54.507]  They're going to frisk them on and off the bus.
[00:41:55.911 --> 00:41:58.253]  And a lot of people go, good, that'll keep us safe!
[00:41:58.374 --> 00:42:00.215]  That'll keep us safe!
[00:42:00.536 --> 00:42:01.777]  That's not America!
[00:42:01.937 --> 00:42:04.219]  It wasn't that bad in East Germany!
[00:42:06.241 --> 00:42:11.987]  But again, maybe you think blimps and helicopters with ground-penetrating radar looking through your walls is freedom too.
[00:42:12.027 --> 00:42:15.631]  Maybe you think of them looking at you in your house, right through your walls.
[00:42:16.354 --> 00:42:19.335]  Maybe you like DARPA handing it out to police agencies.
[00:42:19.655 --> 00:42:22.596]  Maybe you think it's good they've signed deals for bringing foreign troops.
[00:42:22.796 --> 00:42:28.919]  Maybe you think a bill for blanket total amnesty and perpetuity of all illegals forever is good.
[00:42:29.479 --> 00:42:30.019]  Unlimited!
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.861]  But I don't, folks.
[00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:38.025]  I don't think a new assault weapons ban banning 90 plus percent of guns in the U.S.
[00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:39.106]  Yes, yes.
[00:42:39.466 --> 00:42:41.027]  All semi-automatic shotguns.
[00:42:41.367 --> 00:42:42.348]  Yes, yes.
[00:42:42.928 --> 00:42:44.149]  Yes, yes.
[00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.111]  Maybe you think that's good.
[00:42:46.271 --> 00:42:47.272]  I don't, folks.
[00:42:47.712 --> 00:42:48.693]  I don't like it.
[00:42:49.093 --> 00:42:55.178]  I don't like Buffett and Schwarzenegger running around at the Rothschild Palace
[00:42:57.586 --> 00:42:59.047]  And trying to run our lives.
[00:42:59.327 --> 00:43:00.627]  I'm sick of these people.
[00:43:01.227 --> 00:43:04.569]  I'm sick of these slime bags and their devilish media.
[00:43:04.889 --> 00:43:06.690]  And I'm tired of you being dumb.
[00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.971]  I'm tired of you being mentally ill.
[00:43:12.312 --> 00:43:12.672]  We are.
[00:43:13.132 --> 00:43:20.895]  This culture... Folks, I got articles here where they're teaching college courses on how to be a homosexual.
[00:43:24.628 --> 00:43:30.730]  They're teaching courses on how to promote in your community, setting up homosexual public schools.
[00:43:31.671 --> 00:43:33.592]  Where the curriculum is how to be a homosexual.
[00:43:34.452 --> 00:43:46.236]  I got articles here where they're arresting people, after a kid wins a spelling bee at 12 years old, against seniors, the police come and arrest the parents because the kid never signed up with a public school.
[00:43:47.277 --> 00:43:52.479]  I got articles here, I got, I mean we are living in just pandemic evil.
[00:43:54.438 --> 00:43:56.059]  And these people can't even see it.
[00:43:56.079 --> 00:43:57.540]  They're just like an Aztec.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:21.254]  If you were to be teleported back to an Aztec pyramid rooftop, and you'd have been teleported back, and there's the idle shock mule where they'd bench you over the idle and cut your heart out with a big ol' obsidian dagger and kick your corpse down the steps as lunch meat for the roaring crowd below.
[00:44:21.314 --> 00:44:23.355]  This is part of their crowd control system.
[00:44:25.416 --> 00:44:28.501]  You'd have been teleported back to that point.
[00:44:28.541 --> 00:44:38.859]  Let's say you were a professor of anthropology and also had studied Mayan languages, North American Indian languages of Southern North America.
[00:44:39.406 --> 00:44:41.969]  And you were teleported back to that point.
[00:44:42.029 --> 00:44:48.116]  You stood there and you spoke to the high priest and to the king and you said, don't do this.
[00:44:48.156 --> 00:44:48.957]  This is wrong.
[00:44:48.997 --> 00:44:51.079]  This is destroying your culture.
[00:44:51.539 --> 00:44:56.525]  Killing your best and brightest is destroying your gene pool and making you shorter and shorter.
[00:44:56.765 --> 00:44:58.367]  By the way, that's what their God demanded.
[00:45:00.174 --> 00:45:08.676]  It's really, and that's why you got Indians that were six foot two on average in the plains, and same genetic bloodline down south, you know, getting down to five feet tall and shorter.
[00:45:09.196 --> 00:45:15.998]  That's what Chokmul and Kwitskatlipotl and the weaned snake demanded in their delusional fruitcake kingdom of power trips.
[00:45:16.938 --> 00:45:22.880]  And so you, you're teleported back, and no, before you put me in the New York Times saying I believe in teleportation, it's an analogy.
[00:45:23.621 --> 00:45:27.502]  You're teleported back and you try to talk to them and you go, don't do it!
[00:45:27.542 --> 00:45:28.362]  You're crazy!
[00:45:28.382 --> 00:45:29.982]  This is insane!
[00:45:30.842 --> 00:45:39.004]  Taking pieces of glass that are tied to ropes and pulling it through your tongue for hours for pain-induced hallucinations is not good.
[00:45:39.684 --> 00:45:46.525]  They would grab you up, chain you down, cut your heart out, and the whole, everybody there would think you were insane.
[00:45:46.905 --> 00:45:48.286]  They are sane!
[00:45:48.886 --> 00:45:50.386]  They are normal!
[00:45:53.607 --> 00:45:54.728]  And that's what we're about to face.
[00:45:55.048 --> 00:45:58.309]  We are entering that vortex of political mind control.
[00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:03.592]  It's where... I mean, you turn the sitcoms on, everybody's insane and they love freedom.
[00:46:05.033 --> 00:46:07.154]  Gun owners are bad, need to be arrested.
[00:46:07.374 --> 00:46:08.294]  There's gonna be terror.
[00:46:08.314 --> 00:46:09.515]  They gotta put us in camps.
[00:46:09.915 --> 00:46:11.416]  The New World Order's good.
[00:46:12.096 --> 00:46:13.397]  You've watched TV.
[00:46:13.457 --> 00:46:14.337]  You see it.
[00:46:14.458 --> 00:46:16.739]  I don't watch TV maybe an hour a week now.
[00:46:16.759 --> 00:46:19.220]  I see it everywhere.
[00:46:22.108 --> 00:46:23.251]  Why aren't you conscious?
[00:46:23.291 --> 00:46:24.213]  Why aren't you awake?
[00:46:24.294 --> 00:46:26.760]  Why haven't you activated your minds out there?
[00:46:29.375 --> 00:46:53.642]  Because if we, the millions of Americans that know what's going on, do not become aggressive, and outspoken, and psychologically pour a big bucket of water on your neighbors of ice water, and wake these poor victims up, and I know it's tough, as they arrogantly gibber at you, and laugh at you, and smile at you, adorned with their chains, I understand.
[00:46:54.062 --> 00:46:54.922]  But who cares?
[00:46:56.593 --> 00:47:03.518]  I mean, you know, you don't feel hurt or insulted when a schizophrenic is yelling at you at the side of the street corner.
[00:47:04.338 --> 00:47:05.859]  You can tell they're mentally ill.
[00:47:05.959 --> 00:47:08.961]  Well, so what when your family laughs at you?
[00:47:11.983 --> 00:47:15.606]  Just grab them by the shoulders, look them in the eyes and go, you better wake up!
[00:47:15.726 --> 00:47:17.167]  You better investigate this!
[00:47:17.427 --> 00:47:18.808]  You better learn about history!
[00:47:21.454 --> 00:47:23.674]  They're poor little mental patients, basically.
[00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:24.775]  Oh, man.
[00:47:25.855 --> 00:47:26.575]  You know what I'm going to do?
[00:47:27.335 --> 00:47:28.315]  Callers have been holding.
[00:47:28.415 --> 00:47:29.595]  I want to give you plenty of time.
[00:47:29.615 --> 00:47:35.676]  I'm going to come back and just shotgun through some of the headlines so you get an idea of some of the craziness I've got here.
[00:47:35.696 --> 00:47:40.077]  And then we're going to come back and take calls for a while, and then I'll get back into the news in more detail.
[00:47:40.117 --> 00:47:49.879]  But, I mean, I can't handle Schwarzenegger and Buffett running around at the Rothschild Castle calling for world government and
[00:47:50.808 --> 00:47:58.131]  And then running around calling for big government and open borders and everything else and calling a conservative and saying they're going to raise our taxes.
[00:47:58.171 --> 00:48:02.853]  I mean, I just... It's such an example of how this is all a rigged game.
[00:48:05.814 --> 00:48:07.154]  And it really does make me sick.
[00:48:09.575 --> 00:48:14.837]  And we need to get on more AM and FM affiliates so we can reach the American people and warn them.
[00:48:16.238 --> 00:48:16.998]  Wake them up.
[00:48:18.459 --> 00:48:19.419]  Because I just...
[00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:24.491]  Again, it's like watching millions of victims get in the car with Ted Bundy.
[00:48:25.613 --> 00:48:28.178]  And when you warn them, don't be in the car, they laugh at you.
[00:48:28.478 --> 00:48:30.742]  Oh, you're just trying to stop me from having fun.
[00:48:31.385 --> 00:48:33.065]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:48:33.165 --> 00:48:35.666]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:36.546]  It feels great.
[00:48:36.726 --> 00:48:37.727]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:48:37.847 --> 00:48:43.248]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:48:43.508 --> 00:48:45.289]  I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:48:45.429 --> 00:48:48.630]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:49.410]  Incredible!
[00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:50.810]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:54.551]  I have a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:57.992]  Sharon lost 28 pounds with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:48:58.072 --> 00:49:05.219]  I have arthritis and I have a thyroid problem and blood pressure and Vim and Vigor has really been a blessing to me.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:11.166]  I've lost 28 pounds and counting and I thank them very much from the bottom of my heart.
[00:49:11.546 --> 00:49:16.211]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:49:16.571 --> 00:49:18.132]  Call right now, 1-800-622-FIN.
[00:49:18.793 --> 00:49:23.176]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:49:23.396 --> 00:49:24.877]  $25 off a 3-month supply.
[00:49:25.097 --> 00:49:28.080]  So call Vim and Vigor today, 1-800-622-FIN.
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.762]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:49:31.922 --> 00:49:33.904]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:49:33.984 --> 00:49:44.692]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:49:45.052 --> 00:49:49.577]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the black Berkey purification element.
[00:49:49.658 --> 00:50:00.991]  When used, water flow through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:08.416]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:50:08.816 --> 00:50:10.957]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:50:11.458 --> 00:50:16.421]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[00:50:16.721 --> 00:50:22.885]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:50:22.905 --> 00:50:24.006]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[00:50:24.066 --> 00:50:24.947]  That's toll free!
[00:50:24.967 --> 00:50:25.007]  888-803-4438.
[00:50:32.032 --> 00:50:36.379]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:41.006]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:41.126 --> 00:50:45.512]  There is a chance to use this disaster in a New World Order.
[00:50:45.633 --> 00:50:46.894]  A New World Order?
[00:50:47.597 --> 00:50:47.977]  Panama!
[00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:52.901]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:52.961 --> 00:50:59.885]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:00.026 --> 00:51:02.067]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:02.387 --> 00:51:12.834]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:13.034 --> 00:51:15.156]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[00:51:15.356 --> 00:51:18.399]  Then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:22.283]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:22.303 --> 00:51:22.663]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:22.683 --> 00:51:23.945]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:51:34.503 --> 00:51:37.006]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:51:37.527 --> 00:51:40.270]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:53.046 --> 00:51:54.387]  It goes very, very deep.
[00:51:54.447 --> 00:51:57.930]  When you get down to the bottom of it, it burns, burns, burns.
[00:51:59.432 --> 00:52:06.438]  The truth hurts, but not facing it is much, much more painful, not just the long term, but even the short term.
[00:52:08.279 --> 00:52:18.949]  And when it seems like resistance is futile, understand, folks, that if we weren't here fighting this, if you weren't out there involved and educating people, we would already be in
[00:52:20.808 --> 00:52:24.949]  Just almost unimaginably worse position right now.
[00:52:25.749 --> 00:52:34.371]  And with my whole Aztec analogy, or Mayan analogy, I was trying to illustrate, you know, being in a nation of crazy people.
[00:52:36.791 --> 00:52:43.753]  But you're crazy because, according to the definition, crazy is just going against the norm.
[00:52:45.265 --> 00:52:47.126]  So you don't believe in human sacrifice.
[00:52:47.146 --> 00:52:54.069]  You don't believe in a religion of dominating and enslaving and pressing on the nerve of power, as George Orwell said.
[00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:58.212]  Which, by the way, that's been the norm in almost every empire and culture.
[00:52:59.412 --> 00:53:02.714]  The West, the modern West, has just been a little bit different.
[00:53:06.356 --> 00:53:14.780]  And so now everything's shifting back to the older, centralized, Babylonian model.
[00:53:16.933 --> 00:53:29.919]  And the massive people out there have had the scientifically crafted psychological warfare systems used against them where they can't even think anymore.
[00:53:29.979 --> 00:53:34.701]  They're just ruling masses of idiocy and labels.
[00:53:34.761 --> 00:53:41.424]  I mean, it's like the conservatives that call into shows I'm on and say, I'm for Bush's gun control, you're a liberal, because you're against it.
[00:53:41.444 --> 00:53:43.345]  And I go, then you're not a conservative.
[00:53:43.365 --> 00:53:45.306]  And they don't understand.
[00:53:46.477 --> 00:53:52.678]  It's like all the big conservative news services and websites are selling Arnold garbage and supporting him.
[00:53:53.018 --> 00:53:54.018]  Shame on them!
[00:53:55.379 --> 00:53:56.779]  And you know who I'm talking about!
[00:53:59.499 --> 00:54:05.721]  Again, I keep talking about Arnold because it's such an amazing illustration and it just gets crazier and crazier by the minute.
[00:54:06.821 --> 00:54:09.601]  We're going to come back for the next hour and go to Larry and everybody else.
[00:54:11.122 --> 00:54:13.022]  And again, there is just so much of this news.
[00:54:13.963 --> 00:54:18.507]  Other figures, gay men go overseas for surrogate babies.
[00:54:19.227 --> 00:54:20.849]  This is out of the Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:23.451]  Just out of control.
[00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:26.373]  Buffett's tax criticism draws rebukes.
[00:54:27.614 --> 00:54:29.115]  Yep, going to raise taxes.
[00:54:29.636 --> 00:54:31.697]  Walmart expands RFID mandate.
[00:54:32.118 --> 00:54:34.219]  They have said that, okay, we heard your boycott.
[00:54:34.499 --> 00:54:35.841]  We're not going to use RFID.
[00:54:35.881 --> 00:54:41.325]  And I said, within one month, they will announce that they're going to expand the program by at least double.
[00:54:42.339 --> 00:54:46.422]  Okay, well, this says that it's going to be total, all products, now they don't care.
[00:54:46.442 --> 00:54:48.843]  That's what they originally said, of course.
[00:54:50.184 --> 00:54:53.426]  Backers of RFID chips, banking on alien concept.
[00:54:53.486 --> 00:54:55.527]  This is out of Business Journal.
[00:54:56.327 --> 00:55:02.511]  Alien is basically a front NSA company, and its symbol is a flying saucer.
[00:55:03.212 --> 00:55:05.333]  No, we're not talking about flying saucers.
[00:55:05.393 --> 00:55:06.934]  That's the headline, Business Journal.
[00:55:07.854 --> 00:55:10.676]  Silicon Valley, San Jose, Business Journal.
[00:55:13.338 --> 00:55:14.759]  Just, oh, there's so much more.
[00:55:15.079 --> 00:55:20.202]  It's all coming up in the next hour, and we're going to cover it, and we're going to take your calls.
[00:55:21.443 --> 00:55:32.530]  Before I end this hour, if you want to support us, if you believe in what we're doing, if you want to wake others up, if you don't want to just sit down in the ditch and lick the boots of the stormtroopers, then get my video, Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:35.832]  Get my newest film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:55:35.872 --> 00:55:40.855]  Get the new book by Paul Joseph Watson, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terrorism, The New World Order.
[00:55:41.579 --> 00:55:48.125]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free right now at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:48.145 --> 00:55:58.574]  You will be an expert on the New World Order after you watch these films and read these books.
[00:55:58.594 --> 00:55:58.654]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:06.269 --> 00:56:07.510]  You think stuff's crazy now?
[00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:12.814]  They're just getting you ready for the real launch of the dehumanization campaign.
[00:56:13.254 --> 00:56:13.734]  Resist.
[00:56:13.915 --> 00:56:14.635]  Mobilize.
[00:56:15.576 --> 00:56:16.156]  Activate.
[00:56:17.417 --> 00:56:18.198]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:18.698 --> 00:56:19.218]  Stay with me.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:23.221]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:56:23.541 --> 00:56:29.266]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:56:29.526 --> 00:56:32.408]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the weir...
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.459]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.046 --> 00:56:47.687]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.367 --> 00:56:49.388]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.129 --> 00:56:51.229]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:52.711]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.471 --> 00:56:54.352]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.372 --> 00:56:58.775]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.215 --> 00:57:03.338]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:08.242 --> 00:57:10.604]  Alright, we covered some news last hour.
[00:57:11.582 --> 00:57:41.168]  But a lot of what got telegraphed is just my stunned amazement at the criminality, at the acceleration of tyranny by the globalists, and the blatant hypocrisy that a two-year-old should be able to figure out, and just the false reality nature of what the New World Order is up to politically, worldwide, and how they're raping the people of the world, and then skillfully
[00:57:41.798 --> 00:57:51.543]  Carrying out dog and pony shows in the media between their low-level minions to give the illusion of some type of political debate, discourse, or choice.
[00:57:52.863 --> 00:58:05.249]  Only by realizing the fraudulent nature of the false reality that's been spun before our eyes by the carnival barkers can we get humanity, our creativity, our decency back, folks.
[00:58:08.689 --> 00:58:14.357]  We're about to go to your calls, and then I'm going to launch into all this other news, and boy, is there a lot of it.
[00:58:14.937 --> 00:58:18.362]  Let's go to Larry in Louisiana, then Steve Emmett and others.
[00:58:18.763 --> 00:58:20.365]  Larry, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:58:20.745 --> 00:58:22.027]  Alex, they did it today.
[00:58:22.087 --> 00:58:25.792]  First day of school, Rapids Parish, which the parish is a county in Louisiana.
[00:58:27.383 --> 00:58:32.766]  We voted last year to double their pay, the police, the sheriff, and put one in each school.
[00:58:32.866 --> 00:58:36.147]  Now, we have a monitor right at the front doorway.
[00:58:36.167 --> 00:58:38.548]  Of course, he's packing a gun, so he's backing it up.
[00:58:40.089 --> 00:58:43.790]  The parents at the door are not allowed to go in the hallways.
[00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:46.191]  No unauthorized adults in the hall.
[00:58:47.932 --> 00:58:48.372]  That's right.
[00:59:08.952 --> 00:59:10.473]  You used to be able to, you know, the little ones.
[00:59:10.953 --> 00:59:12.714]  They might soil themselves during the day.
[00:59:12.754 --> 00:59:15.235]  Well, they call you up and say, can you bring over an extra pair of clothes?
[00:59:15.596 --> 00:59:17.036]  Well, now the clothes go to the office.
[00:59:17.076 --> 00:59:18.117]  You will not be allowed.
[00:59:18.157 --> 00:59:21.138]  That is not a reason to go in there and change your child's clothes.
[00:59:21.198 --> 00:59:23.179]  Oh, so now the perverts are going to do it.
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:24.040]  Think about it.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:28.602]  They can't say nothing about being a dyke or a faggot.
[00:59:28.982 --> 00:59:31.264]  If those words are okay to say, I guess they can arrest me.
[00:59:31.984 --> 00:59:33.465]  But being a teacher and being that.
[00:59:33.745 --> 00:59:35.846]  But they're going to be changing your little children, people.
[00:59:36.246 --> 00:59:37.187]  Point to you, Alex.
[00:59:37.267 --> 00:59:37.607]  It's sick.
[00:59:38.634 --> 00:59:42.858]  I'm having trouble with my circuit breaker box in my house, and I know you can figure this one out.
[00:59:43.859 --> 00:59:47.662]  I decided to follow the national model some time ago and deregulate it.
[00:59:47.762 --> 00:59:52.126]  I had 15 breakers in the box, and I decided just, you know, put them down to one breaker.
[00:59:52.166 --> 00:59:54.428]  That way I wouldn't have to maintain 15 whole breakers.
[00:59:54.828 --> 01:00:00.033]  Well, my stove gets hot, and it blows the power in the whole house when that breaks, and I can't figure it out, Alex.
[01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:11.147]  Well, actually, I am not an electrician, and I'm the wrong person to ask about technical stuff, and we don't have a handyman show here, but hold on a minute.
[01:00:11.587 --> 01:00:28.571]  Now, all over the country, they've taken young children and stripped them down and done this, and the highest level of truancy officers, teachers, this is where the perverts go, they've been caught doing it, and you have a very valid point
[01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:39.402]  And you're telling... I got the news article about Louisiana, but it's a bunch of areas now where they're not going to let parents in to see their kids and all the more reason to get your kid out of the public school.
[01:00:40.142 --> 01:00:45.047]  Now they want to take vouchers and federalize the private schools and then ban homeschooling.
[01:00:45.067 --> 01:00:45.448]  Go ahead.
[01:00:46.381 --> 01:00:48.883]  Exactly, and that's what it boils down to.
[01:00:49.203 --> 01:00:56.469]  So I'm going to try to get a list of the qualifications that does allow the parent to go into the hallway, to go down to the classroom.
[01:00:56.489 --> 01:00:58.130]  Well look, it's about training the kids they're prisoners.
[01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:06.677]  Drug dogs, frisk, tattletale sessions with the school counselor, BATF in the schools writing dossiers on mommy and daddy, old mainstream news folks.
[01:01:07.337 --> 01:01:11.520]  They are barbed wire fences around the schools, turning them into prison camps.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.501]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:01:13.761 --> 01:01:14.141]  Exactly.
[01:01:14.261 --> 01:01:23.967]  But the point on the fuse box is they put all the power supplies into one unit instead of small individual power supplies, so it only takes three hits to knock the power out of the whole country.
[01:01:25.167 --> 01:01:25.808]  That's not it.
[01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:26.748]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:01:26.768 --> 01:01:29.670]  I haven't talked much about... Well, that's it.
[01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:31.071]  The centralization.
[01:01:31.091 --> 01:01:33.652]  This has not been deregulation or privatization.
[01:01:33.672 --> 01:01:34.693]  It's been centralization.
[01:01:35.753 --> 01:01:37.926]  And I guess I should talk about the power situation.
[01:01:37.946 --> 01:01:39.354]  I'll do that if it takes more calls.
[01:01:42.722 --> 01:01:44.703]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:01:44.803 --> 01:01:55.507]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:01:55.887 --> 01:02:00.409]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:02:00.469 --> 01:02:11.793]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:02:12.393 --> 01:02:19.240]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.782]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:02:22.263 --> 01:02:27.248]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:02:27.548 --> 01:02:33.714]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[01:02:34.895 --> 01:02:49.665]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:02:50.005 --> 01:02:51.386]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:02:51.566 --> 01:02:53.768]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:02:53.928 --> 01:02:56.009]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:02:56.289 --> 01:03:01.153]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:03:04.855 --> 01:03:05.595]  The United States.
[01:03:05.835 --> 01:03:07.616]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:03:07.696 --> 01:03:18.339]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:03:18.499 --> 01:03:20.400]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.461]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:25.982]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:44.311]  I've lost 10 pounds with the collagen aid so far.
[01:03:44.531 --> 01:03:45.232]  Give it a try.
[01:03:45.432 --> 01:03:46.192]  Worked good for me.
[01:03:46.393 --> 01:03:49.775]  I'm going to have to go get re-measured because my pants are getting kind of baggy on me.
[01:03:49.915 --> 01:03:51.397]  My stomach is not there no more.
[01:03:51.477 --> 01:03:52.397]  It's really very easy.
[01:03:52.598 --> 01:03:53.518]  Helps me sleep good.
[01:03:53.799 --> 01:03:54.319]  Lose weight.
[01:03:54.559 --> 01:03:55.160]  Tones me up.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.060]  Hey, I like it.
[01:03:56.421 --> 01:04:03.166]  Trying to lose weight for someone in a wheelchair is extremely frustrating and the first month that I tried it, I lost 6 pounds.
[01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:04.247]  What are you waiting for?
[01:04:18.986 --> 01:04:24.732]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, which means a leaner, healthier you.

[01:04:26.354 --> 01:04:26.774]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:04:26.834 --> 01:04:28.836]  And get $25 off a 3-month supply of Collagenate.
[01:04:28.856 --> 01:04:31.399]  Lose fat the safe and healthy way with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[01:04:31.439 --> 01:04:31.899]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:04:42.985 --> 01:04:45.207]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:45.767 --> 01:04:48.649]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:48.669 --> 01:05:03.178]  A caller in the last segment brought up an important point that they've got all the different power grids tied in together.
[01:05:05.599 --> 01:05:09.842]  Not just in regions, but in some cases make up dozens of states.
[01:05:11.414 --> 01:05:17.077]  But the regions themselves are connected, and I've seen them right here in Austin.
[01:05:17.157 --> 01:05:30.062]  The federal government, along with private corporations, really tried to force the city to shut down its power plant to then hand it over to private corporations so they could jack up prices.
[01:05:30.543 --> 01:05:35.485]  We've seen them, when they're able to do this in surrounding areas, jack up the prices.
[01:05:37.845 --> 01:05:44.827]  And then they even got some of the socialists to go and complain and say, shut down the power plant in our minority neighborhood.
[01:05:45.407 --> 01:05:47.328]  It's noisy and bothers us.
[01:05:47.368 --> 01:05:52.390]  And then it turned out that group had actually been paid off to just go say that and make that up.
[01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:55.030]  I mean, this is how they operate.
[01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:59.652]  And so what you're seeing is a consolidation, a centralization of power.
[01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:07.775]  And I don't know if the power got turned off by accident or by a lightning strike.
[01:06:08.836 --> 01:06:11.558]  And certainly I know that our infrastructure is old.
[01:06:12.659 --> 01:06:17.822]  And there's articles here where they're moving the power plants out of country because we're not going to need them, folks.
[01:06:19.764 --> 01:06:21.625]  Because we're not going to have any factories.
[01:06:21.765 --> 01:06:25.408]  They're saying that and they want to get you ready for rationing.
[01:06:25.468 --> 01:06:28.310]  See, it's part of living in the Orwellian system.
[01:06:31.539 --> 01:06:33.119]  The globalists don't care about you.
[01:06:33.199 --> 01:06:43.122]  Their pleasure as feudal lords, as neo-robber barons, is about having you at a subsistence level.
[01:06:43.182 --> 01:06:43.762]  They've said it.
[01:06:44.122 --> 01:06:58.005]  They want you in highly controlled, compact cities, living at a subsistence level, having to gift-wrap all your trash and garbage, having CPS inspect your home and visit every family and license parents.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.361]  This is the new system enforcing dozens of new vaccines.
[01:07:02.421 --> 01:07:08.243]  It's now 40-plus vaccines that they're trying to make mandatory, ordering kids to take by the age of four.
[01:07:09.843 --> 01:07:10.984]  Imagine this system!
[01:07:12.564 --> 01:07:15.525]  And the more control you give them, the more they're going to use it against you.
[01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:16.746]  They had a war on drugs.
[01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:19.886]  There's triple the heroin, double the cocaine, more people in prison than ever.
[01:07:20.587 --> 01:07:21.767]  They had a war on illiteracy.
[01:07:22.107 --> 01:07:23.067]  There's more illiteracy.
[01:07:23.087 --> 01:07:25.768]  They're going to have a war on terror now, folks.
[01:07:26.368 --> 01:07:27.809]  They're going to have more terror because
[01:07:28.622 --> 01:07:30.903]  It is a war, but it's a war on your freedoms.
[01:07:32.484 --> 01:07:35.945]  And the terrorists have to have an excuse to run your life.
[01:07:38.066 --> 01:07:41.448]  And they're totally ruthless, and they're planning even bigger terrorist attacks.
[01:07:42.568 --> 01:07:44.729]  Now let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Florida.
[01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:45.629]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:07:45.689 --> 01:07:46.150]  Go ahead.
[01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:47.530]  Hi, Alex.
[01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:48.431]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:07:48.451 --> 01:07:49.191]  Can you hear me fine?
[01:07:49.551 --> 01:07:50.071]  Yes, sir.
[01:07:50.491 --> 01:07:53.933]  I have several phone numbers for the Governor and the Attorney General of Alabama.
[01:07:54.831 --> 01:08:00.134]  Uh, we attended the rally to support Judge Moore and the Ten Commandments, uh, the other day in Montgomery.
[01:08:00.974 --> 01:08:09.819]  And the monument may be removed from the Supreme Court building, uh, this Wednesday, the 20th, unless we, uh, uh, fire off a bunch of phone calls, and I've got those numbers ready.
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:14.821]  Okay, and these are phone numbers to the Governor?
[01:08:15.182 --> 01:08:17.083]  I've got the Attorney General Bill Pryor.
[01:08:17.143 --> 01:08:18.303]  I'll start with his phone numbers.
[01:08:19.164 --> 01:08:19.984]  I've already called them.
[01:08:20.644 --> 01:08:22.365]  Uh, the area code for all these numbers are 334.
[01:08:24.668 --> 01:08:27.129]  Here's the first number, 3530138.
[01:08:32.733 --> 01:08:37.215]  See, that's why I don't like giving numbers out, Steve, because you notice you just messed up there.
[01:08:37.555 --> 01:08:40.117]  Yeah, I got it written in front of me, my mistake.
[01:08:40.317 --> 01:08:41.138]  But see what happens?
[01:08:41.478 --> 01:08:41.938]  I understand.
[01:08:42.238 --> 01:08:42.859]  See what happens?
[01:08:43.779 --> 01:08:45.740]  Now, I don't know what the phone number is now.
[01:08:47.001 --> 01:08:50.443]  I support not taking the Ten Commandments out, I think it's important, but
[01:08:50.933 --> 01:08:52.674]  At the same time, I don't know the phone number.
[01:08:53.094 --> 01:08:54.495]  I've got it right here, if I may continue.
[01:08:55.255 --> 01:08:56.636]  Well, you need to give it out again.
[01:08:56.656 --> 01:08:58.577]  I will, and I'll be very careful.
[01:08:58.877 --> 01:08:59.217]  Okay.
[01:08:59.977 --> 01:09:00.578]  Area code 334-353-0138.
[01:09:00.638 --> 01:09:05.160]  And that's just a message that they've got set up.
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:06.360]  You just wait for the...
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.381]  Message and talk your talk.
[01:09:11.701 --> 01:09:12.301]  So it's 334-353-0138.
[01:09:12.341 --> 01:09:14.583]  That's the first line.
[01:09:14.703 --> 01:09:17.444]  I think it's important.
[01:09:17.544 --> 01:09:19.105]  People ought to go knock on the door.
[01:09:19.645 --> 01:09:27.510]  People ought to go in and see the Attorney General or see the rude security guard who will bug his eyes out at you and tell you to stay in line.
[01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:33.213]  But, hauling that, I mean, I don't know if they're actually going to listen to it.
[01:09:34.213 --> 01:09:37.135]  Now, probably what's going to happen is,
[01:09:38.024 --> 01:09:45.045]  They're going to go ahead and order the stuff removed and then come in and try to take it out and it's going to turn into a big plight of circus.
[01:09:45.185 --> 01:09:53.727]  But we do need to resist this because if they're allowed to take the Ten Commandments out, there's been a suit to get rid of the Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:09:53.767 --> 01:09:56.008]  There's been federal court rulings.
[01:09:56.688 --> 01:10:03.489]  Kentucky ruled that the Declaration of Independence is unconstitutional because it has the word creator in it.
[01:10:04.116 --> 01:10:10.860]  But they can have a faith-based initiative to pay off the Baptist churches to suddenly be anti-gun and anti-family.
[01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:15.704]  So it's very important and I'm glad you called about this, Steve.
[01:10:15.764 --> 01:10:18.705]  What do you think about the power outages?
[01:10:20.186 --> 01:10:27.771]  I think maybe they did it purposely to get everything refinanced and rebuild everything and tax everybody further with higher rates.
[01:10:28.212 --> 01:10:31.674]  When I first heard about it I wasn't sure, but after watching the unified
[01:10:32.791 --> 01:10:35.613]  What stinks even further is yesterday I heard on ABC News they said it was a tree.
[01:10:35.633 --> 01:10:37.575]  I guess they think I'm pretty stupid.
[01:11:03.513 --> 01:11:04.574]  That's caused by a tree.
[01:11:04.854 --> 01:11:08.237]  So they're saying one tree fell into one line and did all this.
[01:11:08.357 --> 01:11:12.060]  That's what they said, but that's incredibly idiotic, so we won't even go there.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.881]  I've got Governor Bob Riley's phone number.
[01:11:14.242 --> 01:11:15.383]  Okay, Bob Riley.
[01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:18.785]  Here's his executive assistant.
[01:11:18.805 --> 01:11:21.748]  Area code 334-353-7210.
[01:11:22.749 --> 01:11:29.494]  And I've called these numbers and spoke to them and given my opinion and supported Judge Moore.
[01:11:30.355 --> 01:11:31.115]  They're very polite.
[01:11:31.195 --> 01:11:31.976]  I was very polite.
[01:11:32.461 --> 01:11:34.202]  I've got another number for the Governor right here.
[01:11:34.222 --> 01:11:36.382]  Same area code.
[01:11:36.402 --> 01:11:37.583]  334-242-7100.
[01:11:37.603 --> 01:11:41.204]  That's for the Governor.
[01:11:41.544 --> 01:11:48.047]  While you're at it, when you call, tell them you're going to go ahead and take your kids out of public school.
[01:11:48.267 --> 01:11:48.987]  Yes.
[01:11:49.027 --> 01:11:54.189]  Tell them that you're going to, if you feel led to do this, stop paying your taxes.
[01:11:55.209 --> 01:11:57.070]  And, you know, see how that
[01:11:58.061 --> 01:12:04.585]  Because Alabama's full of good conservative people, but the government consistently just pays lip service to them.
[01:12:04.785 --> 01:12:05.305]  Absolutely.
[01:12:05.945 --> 01:12:08.647]  I have one further number for Bill Pryor, if I may.
[01:12:08.667 --> 01:12:16.031]  Same area code 334-242-7300.
[01:12:16.351 --> 01:12:18.392]  And what are all these, why does he have different numbers?
[01:12:18.532 --> 01:12:20.693]  Some are his executive assistants.
[01:12:20.773 --> 01:12:27.397]  The first one I gave for Bill Pryor was a message system that they have set up, because there's too many calls coming in from around the country.
[01:12:28.104 --> 01:12:29.786]  And yeah, I think it's good to call politicians.
[01:12:29.806 --> 01:12:32.548]  I think it's good to let them know that we're aware of what they're doing.
[01:12:51.059 --> 01:12:53.901]  And to tell the governor to stand up to the feds.
[01:12:54.341 --> 01:12:55.402]  It isn't even the feds.
[01:12:56.082 --> 01:12:59.384]  The private criminal enterprise running out of DC.
[01:13:00.044 --> 01:13:01.605]  I mean, look at the Supreme Court, folks.
[01:13:01.785 --> 01:13:04.547]  Seven of the nine members appointed by Republicans.
[01:13:05.387 --> 01:13:06.868]  And look at the rulings.
[01:13:06.988 --> 01:13:08.149]  Just look at the rulings.
[01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:11.811]  The same type of conservatism we see from Arnold.
[01:13:13.632 --> 01:13:14.612]  Tax increases.
[01:13:15.673 --> 01:13:16.394]  Gun control.
[01:13:16.514 --> 01:13:17.514]  Abortion on demand.
[01:13:17.534 --> 01:13:20.536]  Homosexuals adopting children.
[01:13:22.791 --> 01:13:23.431]  It's amazing.
[01:13:24.912 --> 01:13:26.073]  Well, it's the same thing with Bush.
[01:13:26.133 --> 01:13:29.394]  I mean, get past the rhetoric, look at the actions, it's a nightmare.
[01:13:31.636 --> 01:13:32.756]  There isn't a choice.
[01:13:33.757 --> 01:13:41.601]  But I have to tell you, for the tens of thousands of calls they're getting a day, and that's what the news, I've actually got a news report on the issue that Steve just raised.
[01:13:42.101 --> 01:13:47.864]  For the tens of thousands of calls they get a day, imagine tens of thousands of calls in your community.
[01:13:49.315 --> 01:13:56.501]  Imagine thousands of doors being knocked on and educating folks about how the environmental movement is about stealing private property.
[01:13:57.221 --> 01:14:06.469]  Imagine tens of thousands of doors getting knocked on to talk about forming local Second Amendment groups to run people for local office.
[01:14:07.558 --> 01:14:14.360]  Imagine tens of thousands of people getting together and paying for billboards to promote local talk show hosts that are telling the truth.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:23.962]  Imagine tens of thousands of people getting together to sponsor local radio stations that have alternative news and views.
[01:14:25.842 --> 01:14:33.884]  Imagine the power of the people putting up their own websites, doing their own access TV shows, writing their own books,
[01:14:35.663 --> 01:14:41.406]  Until this country is knee-deep in exposés against the New World Order.
[01:14:44.888 --> 01:14:50.251]  We need the pamphleteers, like we had before 1776, to get our country back.
[01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:53.312]  We need to first educate the people of the Committees of Correspondence.
[01:14:54.013 --> 01:14:55.974]  By the way, that's coming out of Ashcroft on his
[01:14:57.194 --> 01:15:01.037]  I have a naive Nikon friend that gets his daily indoctrination from Rush Limbaugh.
[01:15:01.057 --> 01:15:05.220]  He was telling me, well Arnold Schwarzenegger admitted he made a mistake and
[01:15:27.563 --> 01:15:29.044]  What he said about Adolf.
[01:15:30.645 --> 01:15:34.969]  And he said, as long as someone has admitted they made a mistake, well, they should be forgiven.
[01:15:35.349 --> 01:15:39.372]  But Mel Gibson can't have a film, word for word, out of the Bible.
[01:15:39.632 --> 01:15:43.555]  He's now edited it, begging, can I please now show it in America?
[01:15:43.895 --> 01:15:45.356]  A wholesome family film.
[01:15:46.057 --> 01:15:46.337]  Yes.
[01:15:47.298 --> 01:15:52.962]  And even Rush Limbaugh said there's nothing in it that would urge people towards any religion.
[01:15:53.722 --> 01:15:55.423]  Yeah, but who cares?
[01:15:55.563 --> 01:15:56.943]  See, this is the point.
[01:15:57.323 --> 01:16:06.566]  Arnold can say he loves Hitler, hang out with Nazis to this day, hang out at Rothschild palaces, run around saying he loves to control people and wants power over men.
[01:16:06.586 --> 01:16:08.627]  All this dictator talk.
[01:16:08.847 --> 01:16:12.448]  It's like if I was a dictator it would be a lot easier, like Bush said.
[01:16:12.468 --> 01:16:15.249]  I mean, I'm sick of it, folks.
[01:16:15.982 --> 01:16:20.585]  It shows how it's a political tool to beat people over the head that love America.
[01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:27.150]  But I said to my friend, Walter, we want this guy to go on and be president of the United States when once he was a Nazi.
[01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:28.671]  And what did he say?
[01:16:29.291 --> 01:16:30.292]  Oh, we can trust him.
[01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:31.433]  He hasn't forgiven us.
[01:16:31.493 --> 01:16:32.313]  And we can trust him.
[01:16:32.353 --> 01:16:34.655]  He's for gun control and abortion.
[01:16:36.516 --> 01:16:36.876]  Stay there.
[01:16:36.896 --> 01:16:39.018]  We'll talk about your idiot friend.
[01:16:42.802 --> 01:16:46.705]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.

[01:18:41.744 --> 01:18:46.009]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:18:46.449 --> 01:18:51.014]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:56.259]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:18:56.619 --> 01:18:58.401]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[01:18:58.461 --> 01:18:59.482]  can barely be read.
[01:18:59.783 --> 01:19:00.764]  It has faded that much.

[01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:43.731]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[01:19:44.071 --> 01:19:49.716]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[01:19:49.996 --> 01:19:55.280]  You haven't alkalized your body and in fact you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[01:19:55.521 --> 01:19:56.081]  You still use
[01:19:56.121 --> 01:20:01.307]  Use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[01:20:01.407 --> 01:20:03.810]  The two most important protein superfoods known.
[01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:06.733]  Finally, you don't consume iodized water.
[01:20:06.993 --> 01:20:14.342]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[01:20:14.642 --> 01:20:18.766]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.

[01:20:44.043 --> 01:20:49.186]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:49.847 --> 01:20:52.188]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:20:56.871 --> 01:20:59.653]  This weekend I turned on the TV for about an hour.
[01:21:01.595 --> 01:21:03.056]  Watched the blackout news.
[01:21:03.676 --> 01:21:06.498]  Then they cut back to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the big diversion.
[01:21:08.314 --> 01:21:09.995]  They had a Republican strategist on.
[01:21:10.015 --> 01:21:12.537]  He was saying, Arnold is very smart.
[01:21:12.657 --> 01:21:15.800]  He is practicing self-inoculation.
[01:21:18.482 --> 01:21:25.087]  He's admitting the Hitler comment about how he admires Hitler was bad, and he's admitting some of the womanizing we've seen in the past.
[01:21:25.927 --> 01:21:27.128]  Self-inoculation.
[01:21:27.188 --> 01:21:28.889]  Yeah, it's acclimation.
[01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:31.011]  It's desensitization.
[01:21:31.331 --> 01:21:32.072]  That's why we have these
[01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:42.237]  Reuters articles about how the Rothschilds met with Arnold and with Warren Buffett a year ago.
[01:21:43.278 --> 01:21:49.383]  Yeah, there's a world government, but you know, it's no big deal.
[01:21:49.403 --> 01:21:55.929]  It's the self-inoculation of every child needs an implantable microchip for their safety.
[01:21:56.542 --> 01:22:02.967]  But then, people will admit that to me on the street, but still say, I'm weird, because I don't like it.
[01:22:03.548 --> 01:22:05.229]  I'm the crazy one!
[01:22:07.591 --> 01:22:14.856]  See, they've been, they've gone through what this Republican pundit said was self-inoculation, and I've said that.
[01:22:15.277 --> 01:22:17.058]  I use the term titrating the dose.
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:21.902]  Because they're about to dump all this poison on our society.
[01:22:22.382 --> 01:22:25.525]  They gotta build up your tolerance for it, you see.
[01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:32.192]  So that's how they get you to where you can handle a cobra bite, is they give you smaller dosages and build up.
[01:22:32.532 --> 01:22:36.273]  Well folks, we've reached the level now where we're swimming in barrels of evil!
[01:22:36.313 --> 01:22:42.815]  Just, they're dumping masses of it, injecting, you know, every angle!
[01:22:42.895 --> 01:22:43.955]  I've never seen!
[01:22:43.975 --> 01:22:46.156]  I can't believe it's moving this fast!
[01:22:46.656 --> 01:22:48.657]  Indescribable levels of evil!
[01:22:49.137 --> 01:22:50.057]  Every angle!
[01:22:51.178 --> 01:22:52.058]  Off the charts!
[01:22:52.858 --> 01:22:55.099]  And then we talked to Emmett in Pennsylvania, and he's
[01:22:56.201 --> 01:23:05.510]  He's talking to the future man, a mindless, spineless, giggling pomp, a neocon, and I've heard them defending Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:07.752]  Well, he didn't mean the Hitler comment.
[01:23:08.753 --> 01:23:15.460]  Well, we can't let the liberals get him, but well, yeah, he's a big liberal, but so what if he's for
[01:23:16.198 --> 01:23:19.341]  You know, the homosexuals adopting kids.
[01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.702]  And so what if he's for gun control and abortion on demand?
[01:23:21.742 --> 01:23:23.604]  And so what if he wants to raise taxes?
[01:23:23.664 --> 01:23:31.190]  Well, you know, we gotta... So overnight now, being a neocons, like being a sports fan, it doesn't mean anything.
[01:23:31.210 --> 01:23:32.971]  It just means you rah, rah, rah.
[01:23:33.652 --> 01:23:35.873]  And now, where'd the conservative revolution go?
[01:23:37.334 --> 01:23:37.915]  Out the window.
[01:23:39.625 --> 01:23:41.867]  I mean, it's a certain kind of call.
[01:23:41.887 --> 01:23:43.609]  I'll be on a talk show, we'll take 20 calls.
[01:23:44.029 --> 01:23:47.512]  One guy calls in and disagrees and he goes, Yeah, I heard Bush is for gun control.
[01:23:47.712 --> 01:23:48.993]  We gotta compromise.
[01:23:49.334 --> 01:23:50.054]  So what?
[01:23:50.655 --> 01:23:52.636]  Well, they're gonna take your semi-automatic shotguns.
[01:23:52.657 --> 01:23:54.358]  The host goes, Well, that's crude of the caller.
[01:23:54.818 --> 01:23:56.760]  Well, I guess I don't need it, you know.
[01:23:57.281 --> 01:24:00.243]  This is our time as conservatives.
[01:24:00.503 --> 01:24:02.585]  You're trying to derail that, Mr. Jones.
[01:24:03.086 --> 01:24:05.448]  Have you ever served this country, boy?
[01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:08.011]  I mean, what does that have to do with this?
[01:24:08.091 --> 01:24:09.352]  I'm defending the Bill of Rights.
[01:24:09.892 --> 01:24:11.113]  Shut up, liberal!
[01:24:12.193 --> 01:24:12.954]  Go ahead, Emmett.
[01:24:13.454 --> 01:24:20.118]  Finish up with your idiot friend who thinks that being a big government pimp is a good thing.
[01:24:20.759 --> 01:24:22.139]  Well, some of his background.
[01:24:22.179 --> 01:24:27.062]  He did serve in the Vietnam War, and he probably feels he has stake in this country.
[01:24:27.603 --> 01:24:33.406]  And he has said, as you just said, I asked him why does he listen to these certain talk show hosts.
[01:24:33.886 --> 01:24:35.007]  Oh, they tell jokes.
[01:24:35.047 --> 01:24:35.588]  Ha ha ha.
[01:24:35.608 --> 01:24:36.228]  They're funny.
[01:24:37.867 --> 01:24:39.348]  There's nothing funny about this.
[01:24:40.469 --> 01:24:42.010]  I put the analogy this way.
[01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:51.696]  If a child molester was once a child molester, and maybe he becomes a good, clean Christian, am I still going to trust my children to go on a field trip with him?
[01:24:52.596 --> 01:24:53.157]  Well, look.
[01:24:54.257 --> 01:24:55.378]  Good analogy, but...
[01:24:56.693 --> 01:25:01.061]  Arnold said he admires Adolf Hitler, and then a year ago he's hanging out with Kurt Voltheim.
[01:25:01.542 --> 01:25:06.992]  So again, UN Secretary General, why does the Rothschild-controlled UN have a Nazi heading?
[01:25:07.513 --> 01:25:08.335]  In full knowledge!
[01:25:09.190 --> 01:25:10.431]  Because they're behind it.
[01:25:10.471 --> 01:25:11.912]  They're behind all these movements.
[01:25:12.372 --> 01:25:16.074]  Nazism, communism, neoconism, liberalism.
[01:25:16.354 --> 01:25:19.176]  They're all about increasing the power of the state.
[01:25:19.396 --> 01:25:22.798]  And they've got us debating, should it be neoconism or liberalism?
[01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:23.958]  Same thing!
[01:25:23.978 --> 01:25:25.559]  Different label, people!
[01:25:25.799 --> 01:25:27.340]  It's the oldest scam in the book.
[01:25:28.421 --> 01:25:29.101]  Here's an example.
[01:25:29.141 --> 01:25:33.043]  I was down in Corpus Christi, Port Aransas this weekend with my wife and family.
[01:25:33.904 --> 01:25:35.665]  And I go into town and I start noticing
[01:25:36.982 --> 01:25:43.244]  We're looking for, you know, a sun umbrella, and they didn't have the anchor for it in the dirt, you know, for the sand.
[01:25:43.784 --> 01:25:44.984]  So I had to go to three different shops.
[01:25:45.064 --> 01:25:53.907]  I noticed in Port Aransas, all three of the big, and they don't advertise this, of the big surf shops are owned by the same people.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.402]  Well, see, it's the oldest trick in the book.
[01:25:57.442 --> 01:25:58.923]  That's all they've done here.
[01:25:59.563 --> 01:26:07.530]  If they've got three different shops, and you're supposed to go to one of them, it's owned by the same people, and they sell the same lousy merchandise.
[01:26:08.431 --> 01:26:10.252]  And have it marked up and priced.
[01:26:10.673 --> 01:26:14.135]  And I notice at one store, one thing would be cheaper, one thing would be more.
[01:26:14.516 --> 01:26:15.817]  And the opposite of the other.
[01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:18.199]  So no matter what you do, they get you.
[01:26:20.732 --> 01:26:22.553]  So your friend likes being a slave, huh?
[01:26:22.833 --> 01:26:27.076]  Side of it is, most of the people I give your films to and talk to believe me.
[01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:28.437]  Well, stay there.
[01:26:28.457 --> 01:26:29.517]  I want to hear a little more about that.
[01:26:33.139 --> 01:26:34.040]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.161]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.181 --> 01:26:39.823]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.945 --> 01:26:46.227]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation.
[01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:49.109]  But during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:26:49.827 --> 01:26:54.968]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the... I N.
[01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:56.669]  $25 off a 3 month supply.
[01:26:56.889 --> 01:26:58.109]  So call Vim and Vigor today.
[01:26:58.129 --> 01:26:58.329]  1-800-622-FIN.
[01:26:58.349 --> 01:26:58.729]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:26:58.750 --> 01:26:58.850]  Folks!
[01:27:15.846 --> 01:27:17.007]  I can't back down.
[01:27:17.047 --> 01:27:18.569]  The globalists aren't going to back down.
[01:27:18.609 --> 01:27:19.610]  They're not going to stop.
[01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:38.247]  They come from people who are experts at herding their serfs into tiny, dirty hovels on tiny pieces of land surrounded by untouched, pristine plantations, estates owned by the elites.
[01:27:39.648 --> 01:27:40.789]  And that's all they're doing.
[01:27:40.969 --> 01:27:44.872]  Everything they're doing today can be traced back to their mindset.
[01:27:44.992 --> 01:27:45.873]  What they're into.
[01:27:46.714 --> 01:27:47.615]  The eugenics.
[01:27:47.915 --> 01:27:48.375]  All of it.
[01:27:49.756 --> 01:27:51.218]  And these are elitist folks.
[01:27:51.238 --> 01:27:53.199]  These are very sick people.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:56.422]  And they're in control because they're ruthless.
[01:27:57.062 --> 01:27:58.824]  And they look at you and laugh at you.
[01:27:58.904 --> 01:28:00.025]  Stop being naive.
[01:28:00.145 --> 01:28:08.332]  I mean, when I found out that almost all the stores in Port Aransas were owned by
[01:28:09.433 --> 01:28:10.514]  One family.
[01:28:11.535 --> 01:28:12.736]  And of course they were foreigners.
[01:28:14.577 --> 01:28:19.601]  And when I found that out and I walked over to the counter and I said, so these are all owned by the same people.
[01:28:19.621 --> 01:28:21.002]  And they said, how did you know that?
[01:28:22.123 --> 01:28:28.988]  Oh, I said, well, it's pretty obvious the layout, what's out front, the prices, the price tags.
[01:28:29.769 --> 01:28:31.470]  I said, cause you know, we did some shopping.
[01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:34.292]  And they got real paranoid.
[01:28:34.852 --> 01:28:36.214]  Manager came over and said, can I help you?
[01:28:36.234 --> 01:28:37.735]  And I was being real calm just asking the question.
[01:28:37.755 --> 01:28:39.617]  I said, so these are all owned by the same people.
[01:28:39.937 --> 01:28:42.480]  Again, how do you know that?
[01:28:43.321 --> 01:28:45.844]  Well, because I'm not an idiot, that's why.
[01:28:46.084 --> 01:28:47.826]  Because I've got my eyes open.
[01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:56.753]  And that's just a tiny, microscopic, microcosm example of what I do and what other people don't do.
[01:28:57.233 --> 01:28:59.494]  I got my eyes open when I walk in somewhere.
[01:28:59.814 --> 01:29:09.196]  I'm looking around me with a historical understanding, understanding how scams operate, knowing what the globalists are up to.
[01:29:10.597 --> 01:29:12.177]  Then you can see the local
[01:29:14.838 --> 01:29:24.681]  Paradigm, the local version of it, as below, above, as below, above, as above, below, they use some of their occult terminology.
[01:29:27.301 --> 01:29:40.485]  So, I just, and how do you, we've got a population totally dumbed down on television, just mindless fad driven creatures, being injected with vaccines full of cancer viruses,
[01:29:41.608 --> 01:30:10.025]  With water supplies being poisoned by the government publicly, with thousands of medical reports admitting it, and just rampant insanity, and Prozac and Ritalin ads everywhere, foreign troops massing, people that say they love Hitler and love Kurt Voltheim being praised by the Simon Wiesenthal Center while, with the next breath, are attacking Mel Gibson and The Passion,
[01:30:11.995 --> 01:30:12.575]  Oh, man.
[01:30:16.556 --> 01:30:18.176]  And they're going to ban free speech.
[01:30:18.596 --> 01:30:20.297]  They're going to take everything you've got, folks.
[01:30:20.397 --> 01:30:21.057]  And you know what?
[01:30:21.777 --> 01:30:29.119]  They'll do it in such a way as most of you are going to thank them and clamor for the smaller amount of resources that are available.
[01:30:29.139 --> 01:30:33.159]  See, the globalists want to restrict resources so you're dependent on them.
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:36.180]  So they can abuse you.
[01:30:38.101 --> 01:30:40.221]  You're in for really painful times, people.
[01:30:41.465 --> 01:30:44.466]  Until you let the globalists know that you know exactly what they are.
[01:30:44.766 --> 01:30:46.767]  But they just keep the illusion going, aren't they?
[01:30:46.807 --> 01:30:48.247]  I'm making callers hold forever.
[01:30:49.808 --> 01:30:51.508]  I'm just on quite a rant today.
[01:30:51.528 --> 01:30:53.869]  Things are very upsetting.
[01:30:55.209 --> 01:30:58.590]  But hey, we're here on the air talking about it, reaching millions of people, and that's what matters.
[01:30:58.670 --> 01:31:00.751]  A lot of good people are taking action.
[01:31:00.791 --> 01:31:02.651]  But real quick, Ernest, Emmett.
[01:31:02.671 --> 01:31:03.572]  I'll keep saying Ernest.
[01:31:04.092 --> 01:31:04.992]  Emmett, finish up.
[01:31:05.892 --> 01:31:07.593]  You were saying something about the videos.
[01:31:11.502 --> 01:31:12.963]  I guess it's gone then.
[01:31:15.384 --> 01:31:16.644]  Oh, you're back now.
[01:31:16.764 --> 01:31:17.145]  I'm here.
[01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:18.805]  Yeah, good to have you on with us.
[01:31:19.106 --> 01:31:19.746]  What's going on?
[01:31:20.106 --> 01:31:25.268]  Well, I gave your 9-1-1 to a former local state official who's a neighbor.
[01:31:25.288 --> 01:31:27.830]  He was completely baffled by it.
[01:31:27.850 --> 01:31:29.050]  He didn't know what to say.
[01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:36.174]  I gave your Masonic Grove film to another neighbor and he said he was invited to join the Masons.
[01:31:36.674 --> 01:31:38.815]  However, now he decided not to.
[01:31:41.365 --> 01:31:42.145]  Glory to God.
[01:31:42.165 --> 01:31:46.146]  And, uh, well, people just don't know what to make of it.
[01:31:46.507 --> 01:31:48.427]  And we have a local grocery store here.
[01:31:48.467 --> 01:31:51.528]  They like to advertise with a little town in Pennsylvania.
[01:31:51.948 --> 01:31:53.809]  We've been in business since 1900.
[01:31:53.889 --> 01:31:58.970]  However, the grocery store chain is owned by people in the Netherlands.
[01:32:01.791 --> 01:32:04.791]  It's amazing, but... That's about it, Alex.
[01:32:05.072 --> 01:32:06.572]  Alright, thank you for that good report.
[01:32:07.290 --> 01:32:07.750]  Thank you.
[01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:13.073]  Yeah, the first report is his friend doesn't care of Arnold's for gun control and all this stuff.
[01:32:13.093 --> 01:32:14.534]  Well, that's the new conservatism.
[01:32:15.214 --> 01:32:20.697]  But the other folks who have, I guess, a few brain cells are concerned.
[01:32:20.797 --> 01:32:23.318]  Let's talk to Ruth in Pennsylvania.
[01:32:23.358 --> 01:32:23.918]  Go ahead, Ruth.
[01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:24.519]  Hello.
[01:32:24.599 --> 01:32:30.742]  I wanted to talk, mention a history, what they call that, the History Channel, a video that they showed last night.
[01:32:31.221 --> 01:32:32.122]  on Nazi America.
[01:32:32.162 --> 01:32:37.186]  But first I just want to mention, since he brought up Pennsylvania, something that's going on in the news here.
[01:32:37.246 --> 01:32:53.659]  Pittsburgh is so broke, as is Pennsylvania and so many other states, that they and the city have closed, get this, the senior citizen centers, where seniors go get their lunch, maybe their only hot meal of the day for a dollar and a quarter, they closed the crossing guards units.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:54.880]  A lot worse than that.
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.743]  They're going to cut the pay of the troops.
[01:32:59.207 --> 01:33:02.068]  Well, because I'm for higher pay, I'm not patriotic.
[01:33:02.308 --> 01:33:07.249]  Because I'm not for the troops getting nerve gas and injected with deadly vaccines, I'm not patriotic.
[01:33:07.449 --> 01:33:09.870]  So you've got to learn how to be a double thinker.
[01:33:10.450 --> 01:33:12.011]  You've got to learn how to be a good slave.
[01:33:12.031 --> 01:33:17.892]  Well, there's just in the swimming pools and the police, the ambulances, all these things are getting cut back.
[01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.573]  But it just goes to the pocket.
[01:33:19.613 --> 01:33:20.653]  Well, you know what the plan is.
[01:33:21.883 --> 01:33:33.289]  They grow the socialist government, get us all addicted to government, then they blow out the government, so-called privatization takes place, everything's handed over to private corporations that are just organized crime syndicates.
[01:33:33.569 --> 01:33:34.510]  They're not free market.
[01:33:35.399 --> 01:33:43.161]  And then they're going to give you a driving tax, which they say is a few years away, to quote, fix the budget woes.
[01:33:43.641 --> 01:33:46.322]  So, before the U.N.
[01:33:46.342 --> 01:33:51.523]  took over the national parks, they cut the funding, shut them down, made the park service people desperate.
[01:33:51.843 --> 01:33:55.124]  Then they said, okay, you'll get more funds, you just got to follow U.N.
[01:33:55.264 --> 01:33:56.764]  orders and make all these changes.
[01:33:57.524 --> 01:34:02.207]  Squeeze the people that come into the parks and charge them $25 and not let them drive their cars in.
[01:34:02.567 --> 01:34:03.588]  So they said, OK.
[01:34:03.948 --> 01:34:05.709]  Well, same thing here with all the states.
[01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:08.091]  Yeah, shut down the seniors' places.
[01:34:08.151 --> 01:34:09.872]  Don't give them hot meals when they need them.
[01:34:10.252 --> 01:34:14.515]  All the decent stuff that churches should have been doing, but that was shut down.
[01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:15.836]  So then it was the state.
[01:34:16.076 --> 01:34:17.457]  Now that's taken and they say, hey,
[01:34:18.584 --> 01:34:24.592]  Arnie's gotta raise your taxes, or the old people don't get their meals, or we can't fill the potholes, see?
[01:34:25.253 --> 01:34:31.681]  See, we're more now, whereas almost all of it goes to quote, interest, on a debt that was created out of nowhere to begin with.
[01:34:31.922 --> 01:34:32.863]  Oh yeah.
[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:36.781]  The History Channel, I want to mention real quick, you would die if you saw this.
[01:34:37.002 --> 01:34:37.862]  I was so shocked.
[01:34:37.902 --> 01:34:38.882]  It was very frightening.
[01:34:39.242 --> 01:34:40.943]  Frightening because it was so well done.
[01:34:41.043 --> 01:34:45.145]  If you didn't know the real facts, you would seriously believe everything they were saying.
[01:34:45.485 --> 01:34:47.306]  It was totally against the First Amendment.
[01:34:47.386 --> 01:34:48.986]  The First Amendment is dangerous.
[01:34:49.627 --> 01:34:51.107]  It's against the Second Amendment.
[01:34:51.407 --> 01:34:53.088]  They were painting a broad brush.
[01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:53.750]  I don't
[01:35:05.786 --> 01:35:10.431]  I actually saw the ad for it.
[01:35:10.792 --> 01:35:15.597]  It goes Nazi America and it shows gun shows and stuff.
[01:35:16.098 --> 01:35:17.039]  So you saw it.
[01:35:17.059 --> 01:35:17.940]  Did it show gun shows?
[01:35:19.041 --> 01:35:23.727]  Everybody they showed was the ratty looking skinhead type with swastikas.
[01:35:24.267 --> 01:35:26.689]  Disheveled looking, a motorcycle type person.
[01:35:26.969 --> 01:35:28.651]  They didn't show any reasonable people.
[01:35:28.911 --> 01:35:30.932]  But Columbine, they said, were Nazis.
[01:35:30.972 --> 01:35:35.316]  They said the people at Waco who motivated Tim McVeigh was a Nazi.
[01:35:35.356 --> 01:35:38.598]  The people at Waco, I'm sorry, Ruby Ridge were Nazis.
[01:35:38.959 --> 01:35:40.220]  Let me stop you right there.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.262]  A third of the people at Waco were black.
[01:35:43.943 --> 01:35:47.906]  I know they're not Nazis, but they said that they were arming for Armageddon.
[01:35:48.431 --> 01:35:51.112]  And Tim McVeigh was there and he was so motivated.
[01:35:51.172 --> 01:35:54.313]  Yeah, well what they do is they sent McVeigh, who was an asset.
[01:35:54.353 --> 01:35:54.613]  Yeah.
[01:35:54.893 --> 01:35:59.615]  This is admitted to all these different places to tie that in to the movements.
[01:35:59.815 --> 01:36:01.775]  They said short waves were contraband.
[01:36:02.235 --> 01:36:07.537]  And when they did the concentration camps during the war, when they impounded the Japanese,
[01:36:07.938 --> 01:36:09.519]  They collected all the shortwaves.
[01:36:09.899 --> 01:36:13.022]  They said that there's going to be lone assassins and they're very dangerous.
[01:36:13.142 --> 01:36:15.103]  A broad brush they painted.
[01:36:15.463 --> 01:36:20.387]  Anybody who's interested... Wait a minute, so they said that they talked about shortwave radio... They're contraband.
[01:36:20.427 --> 01:36:23.809]  They were collected during World War II and they impounded to Japanese.
[01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:29.473]  So they labeled shortwaves as dangerous in the way these people get their message across.
[01:36:30.319 --> 01:36:31.459]  It was bizarre.
[01:36:31.559 --> 01:36:33.780]  I mean, you have to rent this or buy this.
[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:36.201]  But Arnold Schwarzenegger is good.
[01:36:36.261 --> 01:36:37.221]  He loves Hitler.
[01:36:37.281 --> 01:36:38.761]  He hangs out with Kurt Voltheim.
[01:36:38.781 --> 01:36:39.281]  The U.N.
[01:36:39.321 --> 01:36:40.061]  likes Nazis.
[01:36:40.102 --> 01:36:42.442]  They have the top Nazi as the head of the U.N.
[01:36:42.762 --> 01:36:48.184]  See how they're really the Nazis and then they call anybody who loves freedom a Nazi?
[01:36:48.204 --> 01:36:49.304]  That's what this does.
[01:36:50.804 --> 01:36:53.825]  It diverts the attention from the real fascists.
[01:36:54.958 --> 01:36:58.199]  Which is a government marriage with a government corporation.
[01:36:58.379 --> 01:37:02.580]  And they're calling these private citizens who are interested in their family.
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:06.081]  Well, I don't know who they showed these pictures of.
[01:37:06.421 --> 01:37:08.121]  We talked about the Frazier episode.
[01:37:08.141 --> 01:37:09.081]  Did you hear me talk about that?
[01:37:09.241 --> 01:37:09.481]  No.
[01:37:09.921 --> 01:37:13.062]  And there's hundreds of these, but this is just one we now have.
[01:37:14.302 --> 01:37:19.624]  And we found online the complete Frazier sitcom text of that day.
[01:37:19.684 --> 01:37:21.384]  And Frazier joins a gun club.
[01:37:23.596 --> 01:37:30.966]  And they keep telling him they're dangerous, they're racist, they're evil, guns are bad, and the whole family tells him, you know, you're bad to have this gun.
[01:37:30.986 --> 01:37:37.055]  And at the end he goes in, it is a secret meeting, they're all hiding around with this thing to bring down the New World Order.
[01:37:38.514 --> 01:37:41.255]  And he runs out going, they're militia, they're militia!
[01:37:41.295 --> 01:37:42.275]  Screaming in fear.
[01:37:42.355 --> 01:37:44.256]  So yeah, that's the message.
[01:37:44.316 --> 01:37:46.977]  Gun clubs are secretly rebelling.
[01:37:47.057 --> 01:37:48.797]  Books, they label it as bad.
[01:37:48.857 --> 01:37:51.318]  These books that these churches sell, they label as bad.
[01:37:51.618 --> 01:37:53.839]  They said these people want to overthrow the government.
[01:37:54.299 --> 01:37:57.900]  And they said the reason this got going was a misuse of the First Amendment.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:37:59.761]  Unbelievable stuff.
[01:38:00.001 --> 01:38:02.282]  Oh, misuse?
[01:38:02.342 --> 01:38:06.803]  They were attacking the First Amendment and saying how it was so dangerous that these people were allowed a voice.
[01:38:07.583 --> 01:38:09.303]  And they made them sound so crazy.
[01:38:09.584 --> 01:38:10.584]  All right, thanks, Nicole.
[01:38:10.804 --> 01:38:11.764]  Really appreciate it.
[01:38:13.184 --> 01:38:14.365]  Yeah, I mean, take Mel Gibson.
[01:38:15.225 --> 01:38:16.005]  They have gone in.
[01:38:16.025 --> 01:38:17.345]  They are going to re-edit the film.
[01:38:18.706 --> 01:38:33.529]  And the head of Icon Pictures, the head manager for Gibson, the guy that works for Gibson, says, well, we're taking the passages that are word for word out of the Bible out, and we will not show it.
[01:38:33.569 --> 01:38:36.050]  We've been ordered that this is not going to be allowed to show in the U.S.
[01:38:37.365 --> 01:38:39.827]  If it shows the Pharisees ordering Christ's death.
[01:38:41.489 --> 01:38:42.610]  So, that's your new America.
[01:38:42.630 --> 01:38:50.657]  You got a guy traipsing around, who says he loves Hitler and hangs out with Nazis to this day, and says, I don't care about the Nazi stuff, I don't apologize.
[01:38:50.697 --> 01:38:52.579]  It's a tool to shut you up!
[01:38:53.019 --> 01:38:56.762]  And every time you track back a real Nazi group, it's the Feds, folks.
[01:38:57.203 --> 01:38:58.624]  Klan groups, it's the Feds.
[01:38:58.664 --> 01:39:00.145]  Senator Byrd, it's the Feds.
[01:39:00.606 --> 01:39:02.888]  It's the Feds, it's the Feds, it's the Feds.
[01:39:04.784 --> 01:39:07.105]  I mean, I've been trying to build a veteran a new house.
[01:39:08.366 --> 01:39:10.807]  Joe Campana, who just died, by the way.
[01:39:10.827 --> 01:39:11.908]  This was about five years ago.
[01:39:12.368 --> 01:39:16.210]  They were going to bulldoze his house, so we go out and build him a new house here in Austin.
[01:39:17.591 --> 01:39:20.792]  And, uh, cops show up, try to provocateur or something.
[01:39:21.653 --> 01:39:24.534]  We've been out at protests, demonstrating against the Fortune 500.
[01:39:24.614 --> 01:39:25.855]  Cops try to start a riot.
[01:39:26.771 --> 01:39:30.053]  I ran up with video cameras and said, we have police officers engaging in crimes.
[01:39:30.474 --> 01:39:31.714]  I said, you will be prosecuted.
[01:39:31.734 --> 01:39:32.335]  You've been caught.
[01:39:32.775 --> 01:39:35.837]  And they stopped and 50 cops ran across and said, Jones!
[01:39:36.478 --> 01:39:36.978]  Stop it!
[01:39:38.659 --> 01:39:41.921]  And they're only inches away from the day where they'll blow my head off right in plain view.
[01:39:41.941 --> 01:39:42.541]  And I don't care!
[01:39:42.561 --> 01:39:43.902]  I don't care!
[01:39:44.002 --> 01:39:44.923]  I love this country.
[01:39:45.203 --> 01:39:46.644]  I'll stand up for my family.
[01:39:47.004 --> 01:39:48.525]  You are a bunch of criminals!
[01:39:48.906 --> 01:39:49.406]  Criminals!
[01:39:49.486 --> 01:39:49.946]  Criminals!
[01:39:50.006 --> 01:39:50.467]  Criminals!
[01:39:50.527 --> 01:39:50.967]  Criminals!
[01:39:51.027 --> 01:39:51.427]  Criminals!
[01:39:51.507 --> 01:39:51.867]  Criminals!
[01:39:52.168 --> 01:39:52.668]  Criminals!
[01:39:52.708 --> 01:39:53.849]  And I'm sick of you!
[01:39:56.568 --> 01:39:58.129]  I mean, they're out of control, folks.
[01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:59.911]  And we better start questioning authority.
[01:39:59.931 --> 01:40:01.652]  We better get our heads out of the sand.
[01:40:02.153 --> 01:40:04.034]  We better realize the real political paradigm.
[01:40:05.556 --> 01:40:06.737]  Tom in Florida, go ahead.
[01:40:07.317 --> 01:40:08.398]  Or Tim, I don't know.
[01:40:08.418 --> 01:40:09.559]  Who's calling from Florida?
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.541]  This is Tom in Florida.
[01:40:11.621 --> 01:40:12.902]  Okay, I got it right the first time.
[01:40:12.942 --> 01:40:13.342]  Go ahead.
[01:40:13.662 --> 01:40:18.747]  Yeah, I just wanted to weigh in on the Ten Commandments monument situation.
[01:40:20.068 --> 01:40:22.290]  I haven't heard much from you about it until today.
[01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:23.731]  Well, you know,
[01:40:24.762 --> 01:40:28.363]  Do you think I'm not for the Ten Commandments or something?
[01:40:28.703 --> 01:40:29.323]  No, no.
[01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:33.044]  I just figured you had other things that were more pressing, but I... Well, I have... You know what?
[01:40:33.104 --> 01:40:34.325]  I've talked about it for years.
[01:40:34.365 --> 01:40:35.725]  Let me just stop you.
[01:40:35.945 --> 01:40:36.645]  Let me just stop you.
[01:40:37.545 --> 01:40:38.206]  Let me just stop you.
[01:40:39.146 --> 01:40:40.066]  I'm not mad at you.
[01:40:40.366 --> 01:40:41.447]  I'm really upset today.
[01:40:41.467 --> 01:40:43.607]  Let me just articulate something.
[01:40:44.127 --> 01:40:47.288]  I've been talking about how they're taking down the Ten Commandments for years.
[01:40:48.148 --> 01:40:50.469]  And I talk about the movement to do it
[01:40:51.511 --> 01:40:55.033]  How they're trying to say the Declaration of Independence is unconstitutional.
[01:40:55.373 --> 01:40:58.115]  Now, a federal court in Kentucky ruled on that two years ago.
[01:41:00.136 --> 01:41:04.439]  Now, that's all important, and I just gave the phone numbers out, or the listener did.
[01:41:04.819 --> 01:41:05.820]  I think it is important.
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:08.922]  I just pointed out that we need to get active across the board.
[01:41:08.942 --> 01:41:09.442]  Go ahead.
[01:41:10.623 --> 01:41:12.044]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:41:12.084 --> 01:41:19.328]  There's going to be a Rally Wednesday in Montgomery, Alabama, and the website
[01:41:19.707 --> 01:41:25.689]  For people that want more information about it, it's www.christiandefensecoalition.net.
[01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:29.070]  Well, that's good.
[01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:36.712]  They had one this past Saturday with Howard Phillips and Jerry Falwell and others there.
[01:41:37.052 --> 01:41:37.652]  Alan Keyes.
[01:41:38.793 --> 01:41:42.614]  That attracted several thousand people, but now there will be another one Wednesday.
[01:41:42.634 --> 01:41:45.575]  Well, there's the problem right there.
[01:41:47.775 --> 01:41:49.436]  List those three names again.
[01:41:52.031 --> 01:41:54.553]  Gary Falwell, Alan Keyes, and Howard Phillips.
[01:41:55.213 --> 01:41:55.653]  Okay.
[01:41:55.913 --> 01:41:56.454]  Among others.
[01:41:56.634 --> 01:41:57.434]  Alan Keyes.
[01:41:59.716 --> 01:42:01.857]  You know what his job was, right?
[01:42:01.937 --> 01:42:03.418]  Well, I don't want to get sidetracked.
[01:42:03.438 --> 01:42:04.279]  That's peripheral.
[01:42:04.719 --> 01:42:05.359]  No, it's not.
[01:42:05.559 --> 01:42:06.140]  No, it's not.
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:07.100]  No, it's not.
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:08.942]  It's an energy... That one's over with.
[01:42:09.402 --> 01:42:11.363]  It's an energy-sucking operation.
[01:42:11.403 --> 01:42:12.344]  You know how that works?
[01:42:13.364 --> 01:42:14.045]  Yeah, right.
[01:42:14.145 --> 01:42:15.686]  But I don't want to get off on that tangent.
[01:42:16.046 --> 01:42:16.486]  Oh, okay.
[01:42:16.566 --> 01:42:17.207]  Tie you up.
[01:42:17.447 --> 01:42:17.707]  Tie up.
[01:42:18.325 --> 01:42:22.006]  But anyway, there'll be another Rally Wednesday in Montgomery for those that are interested.
[01:42:22.746 --> 01:42:26.527]  And the website is www.christiandefensecoalition.net.
[01:42:29.347 --> 01:42:39.389]  President Bush and Mr. Ashcroft, our so-called professing Christians, they could put a stop to this right now and just tell that federal judge that, look, the U.S.
[01:42:39.449 --> 01:42:44.190]  Marshals are under the executive branch and we're not going to let you use them to enforce your order.
[01:42:45.611 --> 01:42:47.351]  And that judge wouldn't be able to do squat
[01:42:48.598 --> 01:42:51.660]  But you know, don't hold your breath waiting for Bush and Ashcroft to do that.
[01:42:55.201 --> 01:42:59.083]  I think we need to have the states throw the feds out.
[01:42:59.864 --> 01:43:04.346]  Well, okay, the governor of Alabama has been silent on this thing.
[01:43:04.426 --> 01:43:05.447]  He's stuck in the issue.
[01:43:05.907 --> 01:43:11.330]  The Attorney General came out last Thursday or Friday and said, I'm not going to support Judge Moore.
[01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:15.352]  It's my duty to enforce federal, it's my duty to enforce court orders.
[01:43:16.172 --> 01:43:19.694]  Regardless of how I may feel about them personally, and that's just a crock.
[01:43:20.874 --> 01:43:21.935]  He's whipping out too.
[01:43:22.995 --> 01:43:25.836]  You know, and people can be calling them, you know, and raising canes.
[01:43:27.097 --> 01:43:33.300]  But, you know, at the very least, they should refuse to pay those fines that the judge will be imposing after Wednesday.
[01:43:38.042 --> 01:43:45.665]  Personally, if I was the governor, I'd be sending the state police to arrest Judge Thompson, who was healed in state prison for a while.
[01:43:48.607 --> 01:43:55.009]  Well, I mean, what do you... look, you know who appointed all these Supreme Court people.
[01:43:56.869 --> 01:44:01.070]  Bill Pryor is nominated by Bush to be a federal court judge.
[01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:03.271]  He's awaiting nomination right now.
[01:44:03.611 --> 01:44:03.911]  I know.
[01:44:05.791 --> 01:44:07.572]  So, let me explain something.
[01:44:08.472 --> 01:44:12.893]  I've watched everybody but Howard Phillips.
[01:44:12.933 --> 01:44:16.634]  I like Howard Phillips, but the other two, Keyes and
[01:44:20.427 --> 01:44:25.391]  I mean, they're New World Order shills, and I could go into each one of them for an hour.
[01:44:26.451 --> 01:44:35.719]  But Keyes was UN Ambassador, and I just want to point out how basically all our movements are infiltrated, and that's why we can't get anything done.
[01:44:36.915 --> 01:44:39.576]  Well, you may have a point there, you know.
[01:44:40.077 --> 01:44:42.998]  Well, yeah, I'm just pointing out that I'm for the Continental Army.
[01:44:43.338 --> 01:44:45.700]  I just think Benedict Arnold should be removed from the ranks.
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:46.280]  That's it.
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:52.443]  I listened to Alan Key's speech Saturday, you know, and I didn't have any objection to anything he said.
[01:44:52.483 --> 01:44:53.263]  He was right on.
[01:44:53.363 --> 01:44:55.364]  But Benedict Arnold had great speeches, too.
[01:44:55.384 --> 01:45:00.587]  Yeah, well... I'm talking about... I'm talking about who they serve.
[01:45:01.668 --> 01:45:02.388]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:05.319 --> 01:45:11.602]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[01:45:11.982 --> 01:45:16.064]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[01:45:16.564 --> 01:45:23.768]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[01:45:24.328 --> 01:45:31.652]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[01:45:32.012 --> 01:45:34.253]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[01:45:34.593 --> 01:45:37.855]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[01:45:38.255 --> 01:45:41.397]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and height sweats.
[01:45:41.697 --> 01:45:44.698]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[01:45:45.119 --> 01:45:47.960]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:53.323]  And quality that few can match because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[01:45:53.703 --> 01:45:55.204]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings.
[01:45:55.244 --> 01:45:57.005]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at CliffScott.com
[01:46:07.361 --> 01:46:11.844]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:46:12.204 --> 01:46:16.307]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:46:16.588 --> 01:46:17.128]  We listened.
[01:46:17.448 --> 01:46:22.412]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:46:22.712 --> 01:46:23.172]  We listened.
[01:46:23.572 --> 01:46:26.615]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:46:27.035 --> 01:46:27.575]  We listened.
[01:46:28.036 --> 01:46:31.558]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:46:31.698 --> 01:46:32.098]  outages.
[01:46:32.458 --> 01:46:32.938]  We listened.
[01:46:33.298 --> 01:46:38.540]  After 9-11 you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:40.300]  Again, we listened.
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:48.042]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:46:48.442 --> 01:46:51.883]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:46:57.933 --> 01:47:01.937]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:47:02.418 --> 01:47:03.819]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:47:05.701 --> 01:47:10.045]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:10.225 --> 01:47:14.650]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:19.174]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:47:19.214 --> 01:47:20.556]  The New World Order.
[01:47:22.344 --> 01:47:26.567]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:47:26.627 --> 01:47:33.573]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:47:33.693 --> 01:47:35.754]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:36.075 --> 01:47:46.483]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:47:46.703 --> 01:47:47.944]  If you want to understand what the new
[01:47:47.944 --> 01:47:49.145]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:49.245 --> 01:47:50.466]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:48:17.575 --> 01:48:27.480]  Folks, to control a movement, you've got to say some of the things that are the touchstone issues.
[01:48:28.901 --> 01:48:32.543]  And that's what these neocons, so-called Christian conservatives, do.
[01:48:34.304 --> 01:48:37.026]  I hear them all the time, and I listen to them very carefully.
[01:48:39.767 --> 01:48:46.631]  And on big issues like open borders, and on issues like gun control,
[01:48:47.509 --> 01:48:55.154]  And on issues like what's happening to the family, they're very silent when it comes to a big national forum.
[01:48:56.215 --> 01:49:05.901]  But when they're talking to a crowd of people out somewhere at a rally, oh, they'll say everything that needs to be said, and then they'll stand up and push all the buttons.
[01:49:07.722 --> 01:49:13.266]  And that's all I was saying, is that we've got to shatter our illusions.
[01:49:15.735 --> 01:49:18.938]  About these so-called conservative Christian leaders.
[01:49:18.978 --> 01:49:24.562]  I mean, Howard Phillips has a good record and has stood up and has criticized the neocons.
[01:49:26.004 --> 01:49:29.066]  You do not get that out of Falwell and Keyes.
[01:49:29.226 --> 01:49:36.792]  And by the way, Mr. Keyes was the ambassador to the UN, okay?
[01:49:38.274 --> 01:49:42.017]  And the guy's a globalist and I watched his show on MSNBC
[01:49:43.792 --> 01:49:50.076]  Making sense or whatever it was, and I mean it was just mindless, New World Order garbage.
[01:49:50.176 --> 01:49:52.537]  It's like that Scarborough country.
[01:49:55.159 --> 01:49:56.580]  It's false paradigms.
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:04.905]  So, all I'm saying is, is a lot of neocons have attacked themselves for this Ten Commandments issue.
[01:50:06.326 --> 01:50:11.549]  And because they frankly, in the end equation, don't care
[01:50:12.242 --> 01:50:19.205]  Whether they stay or go in this particular courthouse or there in the state.
[01:50:20.165 --> 01:50:23.767]  Because they're going to get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution itself.
[01:50:24.807 --> 01:50:31.370]  And they're going to have the courts rule the Declaration of Independence itself is unconstitutional.
[01:50:34.793 --> 01:50:43.615]  I think it's very, very important that we defend the Ten Commandments and that they stay there, and I think it's a good exercise for people to get involved and stand up and say no.
[01:50:45.676 --> 01:50:49.317]  But how about we put the Ten Commandments in all our yards?
[01:50:49.337 --> 01:50:56.619]  How about we get a hundred towns, get mayors elected who will put the Ten Commandments up in all of their city halls?
[01:50:57.099 --> 01:51:02.561]  Then all the lawsuits in the world by the socialist globalists can't stop us.
[01:51:03.341 --> 01:51:04.181]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:51:06.773 --> 01:51:13.657]  So I was just adding some other points, some ideas that we might try to engage in here.
[01:51:15.037 --> 01:51:17.438]  Because the neocons don't have a lot to talk about right now.
[01:51:17.699 --> 01:51:22.561]  They can't talk about how they're for open borders, or for gun control, or for homosexual marriage.
[01:51:23.682 --> 01:51:25.683]  They can't talk about all that because they're for it!
[01:51:25.863 --> 01:51:32.346]  So, they're going to focus and get everybody real hot over this Ten Commandments issue, which is important.
[01:51:34.557 --> 01:51:36.978]  But I'm just saying, look at all the issues.
[01:51:37.018 --> 01:51:40.459]  So that's probably why you haven't heard me talk about it that much, because I've already talked about it for years.
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:42.200]  Point taken, Mr. Alex.
[01:51:43.521 --> 01:51:43.861]  All right.
[01:51:44.881 --> 01:51:46.182]  Well, good to hear from you.
[01:51:46.202 --> 01:51:47.162]  I really appreciate it.
[01:51:47.442 --> 01:51:52.785]  Look, I rarely get depressed, and I'm not going to lie to people.
[01:51:55.266 --> 01:51:56.446]  I don't want to say depressed.
[01:51:58.387 --> 01:51:59.808]  I don't know how people can't see it.
[01:52:01.767 --> 01:52:03.428]  And it burns my brain.
[01:52:03.568 --> 01:52:14.512]  I mean, it is a very frustrating feeling to know how sick the Globals are and to try to sit here and deal with them.
[01:52:15.252 --> 01:52:16.493]  I just don't know what to say anymore.
[01:52:18.694 --> 01:52:20.554]  I really don't know what to say anymore about it.
[01:52:21.415 --> 01:52:26.056]  We're going to start the third hour and I'm going to take two more calls.
[01:52:26.116 --> 01:52:27.357]  I'm not taking any more calls today.
[01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:31.196]  Because I keep saying I'm going to do it and I haven't done it.
[01:52:31.516 --> 01:52:38.779]  I need to cover the news and talk about it and just try to wake you people up.
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:42.801]  I just... I don't know what to say anymore.
[01:52:44.642 --> 01:52:46.603]  We're in for hard times, I'm not going to lie to you.
[01:52:47.683 --> 01:52:48.684]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[01:52:50.344 --> 01:52:52.465]  They're going to kill a lot of people.
[01:52:52.505 --> 01:52:53.586]  And I can't do anything to stop them.
[01:52:55.333 --> 01:53:02.859]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive, yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:53:03.119 --> 01:53:12.225]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:20.885 --> 01:53:21.527]  Big Brother.
[01:53:22.188 --> 01:53:23.231]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:23.952 --> 01:53:25.075]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:25.716 --> 01:53:26.538]  You want answers?
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:28.081]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:28.837 --> 01:53:32.839]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:33.039 --> 01:53:37.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:45.024 --> 01:53:46.084]  All right, my friends.
[01:53:46.124 --> 01:53:47.405]  Already into the third hour.
[01:53:47.485 --> 01:53:53.047]  We've covered quite a bit of news and covered some of the big issues, but I've got a lot of it here we haven't gotten to, I need to.
[01:53:54.047 --> 01:53:57.789]  So I'll talk to Dan and a few other people.
[01:53:58.855 --> 01:54:04.499]  Arnold and Mark and others, and Don and Brad and others.
[01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:08.041]  And then I'm going to get into news for the rest of the show.
[01:54:08.081 --> 01:54:10.343]  I'm going to try to calmly go over all this craziness.
[01:54:11.864 --> 01:54:15.006]  Let's right now talk to, uh, who's up next, Mark?
[01:54:15.947 --> 01:54:17.528]  Don in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[01:54:18.768 --> 01:54:20.310]  Yeah, good morning here, Alex.
[01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:21.610]  How you doing?
[01:54:21.630 --> 01:54:23.772]  Haha, this is Russ from Pennsylvania.
[01:54:23.812 --> 01:54:25.953]  Yo, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, as they say.
[01:54:27.319 --> 01:54:29.461]  Anyways, I live over here in Newcastle, PA.
[01:54:29.521 --> 01:54:31.322]  I know I'm not allowed to say that, but I am.
[01:54:31.822 --> 01:54:40.809]  Over here in the Lawrence County Courthouse, the Bar Association said that you are no longer allowed to represent yourself without a neocon lawyer.
[01:54:40.829 --> 01:54:49.956]  They also ruled that there's no attorney-client privilege, they can doddle on you, and they're moving to get rid of juries.
[01:54:49.976 --> 01:54:52.718]  Oh, I've already realized that.
[01:54:52.798 --> 01:54:53.839]  The other thing is,
[01:54:54.698 --> 01:55:01.923]  Uh, on January here, I went and talked to a, another, you know, extortionist called an IRS agent.
[01:55:02.743 --> 01:55:06.706]  I went and talked to him for a matter of maybe two minutes, uh, to be honest with you.
[01:55:07.306 --> 01:55:12.629]  He, uh, how can I say, the conversation went quite well in my opinion.
[01:55:13.169 --> 01:55:15.411]  He said, you haven't paid no taxes for a while.
[01:55:15.491 --> 01:55:16.331]  What's your problem?
[01:55:16.952 --> 01:55:17.772]  That's 96.
[01:55:18.313 --> 01:55:22.175]  Now you gotta realize that is significant because it's a statute of limitations.
[01:55:22.816 --> 01:55:23.516]  He goes, why not?
[01:55:23.536 --> 01:55:26.098]  And I said, sir, I've read your book.
[01:55:26.178 --> 01:55:28.879]  I said, here's your book in front of you.
[01:55:28.939 --> 01:55:32.341]  I said, can you show me the law where I have to pay an income tax?
[01:55:32.441 --> 01:55:35.582]  I said, you show me and I'll be more than happy to pay it.
[01:55:36.583 --> 01:55:41.125]  He goes, well, he goes, I'll give you a 96 return, which he did.
[01:55:41.145 --> 01:55:43.306]  He goes, all you got to do is date and sign it.
[01:55:43.666 --> 01:55:52.070]  I said, excuse me, sir, but by me doing that, that violates my Fifth Amendment because this can be used against me.
[01:55:52.833 --> 01:55:55.774]  He goes, well, you're going to love this, Alex.
[01:55:58.475 --> 01:56:07.419]  He turned right around and he goes, he shoved his book that he had, you know, for notes that's just used for propaganda and show.
[01:56:08.019 --> 01:56:11.280]  He goes, well, you're going to go see a federal judge in 30 days.
[01:56:12.061 --> 01:56:12.621]  I said, sir,
[01:56:13.194 --> 01:56:19.516]  I said, according to the Patriot Act, I said, I am hereby considering you as a terrorist against me.
[01:56:19.976 --> 01:56:28.818]  I said, I hereby have authorization to arrest you and throw you in my prison, not a state prison, and I don't have to tell anyone for at least a year.
[01:56:28.838 --> 01:56:31.259]  I said, would you like to reframe that?
[01:56:31.699 --> 01:56:32.999]  He goes, you're free to go.
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:35.080]  I thought I'd let you have fun with that.
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:35.360]  Bye.
[01:56:36.466 --> 01:56:37.027]  All right.
[01:56:37.167 --> 01:56:38.348]  Well, thanks for the call.
[01:56:39.168 --> 01:56:40.969]  By the way, you can say where you're from.
[01:56:41.009 --> 01:56:44.292]  We don't mind first names and where you're calling from.
[01:56:44.312 --> 01:56:45.973]  In fact, we like that.
[01:56:46.013 --> 01:56:50.816]  I just don't want folks giving their first and last name and giving phone numbers out.
[01:56:51.677 --> 01:57:01.144]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to... We'll break and come back and talk to three more callers and then... That's all I have time for because I need to get to news.
[01:57:01.244 --> 01:57:01.964]  I really do.
[01:57:03.065 --> 01:57:05.827]  It's very frustrating for me when I don't cover it all.
[01:57:07.578 --> 01:57:13.780]  And yeah, maybe sometime in this hour I'll plug my videos and the new book I've published, Order Out of Chaos.
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:20.342]  You can only get that at fullwars.com or prisonplanet.com or by calling toll-free.
[01:57:22.163 --> 01:57:29.325]  I don't know though if you really want to find out who carried out September 11th and other terrorist attacks and what their plan is for you and your family.
[01:57:30.886 --> 01:57:33.907]  It's probably not as important as a football game, but hey,
[01:57:34.986 --> 01:57:36.227]  We're weird around here.
[01:57:36.327 --> 01:57:37.567]  We're actually into freedom.
[01:57:37.727 --> 01:57:40.589]  We do apologize in advance for it.
[01:57:42.930 --> 01:57:46.732]  We'll be right back and we'll take some more calls and I'll get into all the news.
[01:57:47.833 --> 01:57:53.456]  Including an article out on CNN about life extension technologies.
[01:57:55.216 --> 01:57:58.578]  So it's a big third hour lined up for you.
[01:57:59.779 --> 01:58:00.699]  Please stay with us.
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:03.981]  And we'll be back on the other side.
[01:58:16.232 --> 01:58:18.575]  I've lost 10 pounds with the collagen aid so far.
[01:58:18.795 --> 01:58:19.516]  Give it a try.
[01:58:19.696 --> 01:58:20.457]  Worked good for me.
[01:58:20.677 --> 01:58:24.041]  I'm going to have to go get re-measured because my pants are getting kind of baggy on me.
[01:58:24.201 --> 01:58:25.642]  My stomach is not there no more.
[01:58:25.743 --> 01:58:26.684]  It's really very easy.
[01:58:26.864 --> 01:58:27.805]  Helps me sleep good.
[01:58:28.065 --> 01:58:28.586]  Lose weight.
[01:58:28.826 --> 01:58:29.426]  Tones me up.
[01:58:29.747 --> 01:58:30.347]  Hey, I like it.
[01:58:30.688 --> 01:58:37.415]  Trying to lose weight for someone in a wheelchair is extremely frustrating and the first month that I tried it, I lost 6 pounds.
[01:58:37.575 --> 01:58:38.516]  What are you waiting for?

[01:59:16.435 --> 01:59:20.781]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:20.961 --> 01:59:25.387]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:25.547 --> 01:59:29.933]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:59:30.033 --> 01:59:31.294]  A New World Order?
[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:37.301]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:37.361 --> 01:59:44.303]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:44.423 --> 01:59:46.484]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:46.804 --> 01:59:56.886]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:57.426 --> 02:00:02.810]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[02:00:15.758 --> 02:00:18.780]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:24.023]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:00:24.263 --> 02:00:28.626]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:00:28.926 --> 02:00:37.832]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:00:38.032 --> 02:00:41.674]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:00:41.954 --> 02:00:47.003]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:00:47.283 --> 02:00:53.975]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:00:54.477 --> 02:00:55.137]  What about you?
[02:00:55.797 --> 02:01:01.139]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:01:19.885 --> 02:01:20.526]  Big Brother.
[02:01:21.206 --> 02:01:22.247]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:22.967 --> 02:01:24.087]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:24.728 --> 02:01:25.528]  You want answers?
[02:01:26.309 --> 02:01:27.269]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:27.869 --> 02:01:31.792]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:32.052 --> 02:01:36.174]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:36.374 --> 02:01:39.836]  Alright, my friends.
[02:01:40.236 --> 02:01:41.957]  Into the third hour.
[02:01:42.937 --> 02:01:43.778]  It is the 18th.
[02:01:45.806 --> 02:01:50.630]  Of August 2003, I'm going to take three more calls, and I'm going right back into the news.
[02:01:50.650 --> 02:01:55.554]  There's a lot of really important stuff we've got to get to, like South Korea fires on North Korean boat.
[02:01:56.214 --> 02:02:00.337]  Russian Pacific Fleet launches major exercise in Far East, the biggest ever seen.
[02:02:02.239 --> 02:02:06.602]  Also, Ashcroft campaigned to shore up the Patriot Act and get the Victory Act passed.
[02:02:06.682 --> 02:02:13.167]  Walmart announces that, yeah, they don't care if you boycott them, they're going to launch total RFID tracking of you and your family.
[02:02:14.850 --> 02:02:16.011]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[02:02:16.151 --> 02:02:19.694]  Right now, let's go to Brandon in Texas.
[02:02:19.734 --> 02:02:20.515]  Go ahead, Brandon.
[02:02:21.175 --> 02:02:22.136]  Yeah, Alex, how you doing?
[02:02:23.257 --> 02:02:23.737]  Pretty good.
[02:02:24.077 --> 02:02:24.578]  Good, good.
[02:02:25.479 --> 02:02:33.225]  Hey there, I'm from Austin, but I recently have been in California for the past month, and I was in L.A.
[02:02:33.285 --> 02:02:35.887]  visiting my dad, and when I was there,
[02:02:36.745 --> 02:02:52.295]  I was walking around in North Hollywood and came across a table with some literature and some young people about my age, some college students, and they had some signs that said, uh, stop Cheney from carrying out another 9-11 and impeach Cheney now.
[02:02:52.936 --> 02:02:59.340]  So that definitely caught my interest and went over there to talk with them and they were with the LaRouche Youth Movement.
[02:03:00.063 --> 02:03:05.804]  And so I wanted to get your opinion on the Lynn LaRouche campaign.
[02:03:07.264 --> 02:03:19.907]  I've read some of his literature and some of the things make me take pause, but it seems that he's the only one in Washington that knows who the real enemy is.
[02:03:20.907 --> 02:03:22.107]  But I just wanted to get your opinion.
[02:03:23.227 --> 02:03:23.747]  Well, thanks.
[02:03:23.987 --> 02:03:24.687]  Thanks for the call.
[02:03:24.707 --> 02:03:25.348]  Appreciate it.
[02:03:29.022 --> 02:03:44.085]  Look, Lyndon LaRouche is a New World Order shill, and he puts out really accurate information about the British oligarchy, the Anglo-American establishment, the New World Order, the CFR, the Bilderberg Group, government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:45.405 --> 02:03:57.647]  And then his answer is kind of a left-wing world socialist government and all these big building projects and... So, basically, he's a
[02:03:58.737 --> 02:04:04.280]  Well, I was just earlier talking about Alan Keyes and Jerry Falwell being phonies.
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:14.846]  They talk about a lot of real problems, but basically just run a business out of it and misdirect people's energies.
[02:04:15.086 --> 02:04:16.967]  And that's what LaRouche does.
[02:04:17.087 --> 02:04:20.229]  And I know this from reading their Executive Intelligence Review.
[02:04:20.949 --> 02:04:22.851]  I know this over the decades.
[02:04:23.051 --> 02:04:27.013]  I know this by watching their weekly TV show here in Austin.
[02:04:29.765 --> 02:04:37.113]  Before the election, you know, Bill Clinton is this horrible British demon agent, the worst ever known.
[02:04:39.075 --> 02:04:42.839]  We have all this evidence, multi-hour long treatises on it.
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:52.089]  And then Bill Clinton gets elected, and Bill Clinton has always been fighting the globalists, and is wonderful, and Al Gore is the evil one.
[02:04:53.038 --> 02:04:58.062]  And Bill Clinton is fighting the establishment with LaRouche, secretly advising him.
[02:04:58.122 --> 02:05:00.543]  I mean, it's just pure propaganda.
[02:05:02.525 --> 02:05:04.546]  And so I've watched them over time.
[02:05:06.007 --> 02:05:12.431]  They have a lot of good people involved in it, but I don't know.
[02:05:12.451 --> 02:05:19.336]  I mean, I've just called them up for wanting information, and I also got the hard-shell
[02:05:21.098 --> 02:05:24.539]  Just another one of the loyal opposition groups, if you ask me.
[02:05:25.339 --> 02:05:28.560]  I'm not in the business of bad-mouthing all these minion groups.
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:35.842]  It really does come down to the individual asking God for guidance in trying to fight the New World Order and educating others.
[02:05:36.542 --> 02:05:40.583]  Where, as a society, we value freedom and know a fraud when we see it.
[02:05:42.084 --> 02:05:43.944]  Let's talk to Arnold in Kentucky.
[02:05:44.024 --> 02:05:44.705]  Arnold, go ahead.
[02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:49.140]  Good morning.
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:49.541]  Go ahead.
[02:05:49.561 --> 02:05:50.361]  How are you?
[02:05:50.882 --> 02:05:51.182]  Good.
[02:05:51.222 --> 02:05:52.323]  It's the afternoon.
[02:05:52.343 --> 02:05:54.705]  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.
[02:05:55.345 --> 02:05:57.026]  I want to have them answered immediately.
[02:05:58.047 --> 02:05:58.928]  Go ahead and answer them.
[02:06:00.029 --> 02:06:02.631]  Who is your daddy and what does he do?
[02:06:05.753 --> 02:06:06.533]  This is fun.
[02:06:08.355 --> 02:06:10.236]  How many more clips do you got?
[02:06:10.797 --> 02:06:11.017]  Yeah.
[02:06:14.338 --> 02:06:19.881]  So, how long have you been enjoying the satanic rituals at the Bohemian Grove?
[02:06:20.961 --> 02:06:21.321]  Yes!
[02:06:24.162 --> 02:06:24.803]  So tell me.
[02:06:27.484 --> 02:06:28.725]  Tell me right now, Arnold.
[02:06:28.785 --> 02:06:29.525]  What do we gotta do?
[02:06:31.046 --> 02:06:40.810]  We've got Arnold Schwarzenegger on the line with us, and I'm asking him about his meeting with the Rothschilds last year, according to Reuters, when he flew in with Warren Buffett.
[02:06:43.789 --> 02:06:44.830]  I've got news for you.
[02:06:45.090 --> 02:06:46.070]  You are mine now.
[02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:47.231]  You belong to me.
[02:06:50.292 --> 02:06:52.973]  Well, that's good.
[02:06:54.594 --> 02:06:55.735]  Arnold in Kentucky.
[02:06:55.955 --> 02:06:56.355]  Arnold?
[02:06:56.375 --> 02:06:57.855]  Nice to meet you.
[02:06:59.856 --> 02:07:00.397]  Is that it?
[02:07:00.457 --> 02:07:05.279]  Is that all you have to... Actually, you've got a larger vocabulary than you normally do today.
[02:07:06.639 --> 02:07:09.481]  This must be what they mean by wedded justice.
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:15.620]  Man, this is something else!
[02:07:16.501 --> 02:07:18.421]  So, you're for open borders.
[02:07:19.541 --> 02:07:23.682]  They know you were in trouble for that, so they're trying to claim now that you're actually against open borders.
[02:07:24.182 --> 02:07:27.343]  But we know you're for abortion, the murder of babies.
[02:07:27.383 --> 02:07:30.844]  We know that you're for total gun control and for higher taxes.
[02:07:30.864 --> 02:07:34.385]  Would you like to comment on this neocon platform?
[02:07:34.405 --> 02:07:35.505]  Stop whining!
[02:07:37.668 --> 02:07:38.468]  Stop whining.
[02:07:38.488 --> 02:07:39.449]  Well, we're not whining.
[02:07:39.829 --> 02:07:44.231]  We're standing up to you as a little Illuminati punk.
[02:07:46.532 --> 02:07:50.833]  You want me to name an advertisement?
[02:07:52.794 --> 02:07:56.656]  Whoever's doing this, I would love to talk to you.
[02:07:57.176 --> 02:08:00.417]  Come on the line and tell me how you put all these Arnold clips in a computer.
[02:08:02.538 --> 02:08:03.198]  Hello, Alex?
[02:08:03.718 --> 02:08:03.939]  Yes.
[02:08:05.876 --> 02:08:07.517]  I just thought you'd like that.
[02:08:08.318 --> 02:08:11.341]  You can get them on the internet quite easily.
[02:08:13.462 --> 02:08:14.143]  Who is this?
[02:08:15.384 --> 02:08:16.205]  My real name is Keith.
[02:08:17.286 --> 02:08:18.567]  Well that is very interesting.
[02:08:18.607 --> 02:08:23.731]  What do you think about Arnold and this giant distraction?
[02:08:23.831 --> 02:08:29.275]  But, by studying the story, it ceases to be a distraction and is very educational.
[02:08:32.938 --> 02:08:38.661]  It's pretty obvious that they want Arnold to be the governor because they're ignoring everyone else.
[02:08:38.781 --> 02:08:44.224]  And Gary Coleman has got the same... You know, Gary Coleman.
[02:08:44.324 --> 02:08:46.605]  He should have the same chance of getting elected as Arnold.
[02:08:46.625 --> 02:08:47.626]  Because they're both the same.
[02:08:47.806 --> 02:08:48.466]  They're both actors.
[02:08:49.587 --> 02:08:52.068]  Well, the globalists love actors though, don't they?
[02:08:52.468 --> 02:08:52.668]  Yeah.
[02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:57.511]  But you know, at the same time, we've got a meeting with the Rothschilds.
[02:08:59.151 --> 02:09:01.993]  And then we have, at the same time as that,
[02:09:04.064 --> 02:09:10.366]  Orrin Hatch, a top globalist in the Senate, moving to change the law so Arnold can run for President.
[02:09:10.386 --> 02:09:16.607]  I don't think that would be very popular though, even if Arnold is popular.
[02:09:17.988 --> 02:09:18.968]  Well, they don't care!
[02:09:19.648 --> 02:09:20.448]  They don't care!
[02:09:21.189 --> 02:09:25.590]  But the question is, why is Arnold hanging out with the Illuminati?
[02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:27.390]  Why do they like him so much?
[02:09:28.511 --> 02:09:29.931]  Well, because he's got the speeches.
[02:09:31.679 --> 02:09:36.082]  I think he's probably a member because he married into the Kennedy family.
[02:09:38.844 --> 02:09:40.125]  Well, yeah, that's a big part of it.
[02:09:40.145 --> 02:09:44.027]  He knows what he's doing, but it goes back before that.
[02:09:44.067 --> 02:09:48.130]  His family, especially who his mother married after his father died.
[02:09:48.190 --> 02:09:58.257]  I mean, mommy likes to marry Nazis, and how do you think he can say he admires Hitler and that's acceptable, but Mel Gibson can't make a biblical movie?
[02:10:02.363 --> 02:10:05.384]  It confuses me a lot.
[02:10:05.404 --> 02:10:12.507]  I just think you have to forgive what they've done in the past, but I don't understand what's wrong with Mel Gibson's movie.
[02:10:15.428 --> 02:10:21.931]  Well, there's nothing wrong with it, other than the fact that it's historical, and it will... they don't like anything that's truly Christian.
[02:10:22.051 --> 02:10:29.873]  They want to equate Christianity with anti-Semitism, but if you're a real live Nazi, you're okay, and that's very hypocritical.
[02:10:31.718 --> 02:10:41.226]  There's no Italian group suing Mel Gibson saying that, because he portrays the Romans killing Jesus.
[02:10:41.966 --> 02:10:45.008]  There's no Italian group suing Mel Gibson.
[02:10:47.390 --> 02:10:53.335]  Well that's it, and they do show the Romans killing Jesus, and I wonder why the Italian groups have not gotten angry.
[02:10:55.957 --> 02:10:58.219]  Alright, thanks for the call, that's very interesting.
[02:10:59.612 --> 02:11:00.972]  Hey, are you still there?
[02:11:01.433 --> 02:11:01.653]  Yeah.
[02:11:02.133 --> 02:11:07.014]  Arnold, can you hit I'll be back for me so you can call in with Arnold maybe later?
[02:11:07.034 --> 02:11:08.154]  Yeah.
[02:11:09.735 --> 02:11:10.975]  Well, go ahead and hit it for us.
[02:11:15.236 --> 02:11:16.157]  That was something else.
[02:11:16.637 --> 02:11:18.157]  He's trying to find it right now.
[02:11:19.057 --> 02:11:23.139]  I guess he's got a menu of Arnold audio clips and he's playing them.
[02:11:24.679 --> 02:11:26.059]  He can't find it, huh, Arnold?
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:27.980]  I'll be fine.
[02:11:29.022 --> 02:11:29.743]  I'll be back.
[02:11:29.783 --> 02:11:30.503]  Well, thank you.
[02:11:31.804 --> 02:11:32.865]  Thank you for the call.
[02:11:33.085 --> 02:11:34.086]  Really appreciate that.
[02:11:34.727 --> 02:11:40.311]  Man, when I first heard it, I thought, man, that is a really good imitator of Arnold.
[02:11:42.333 --> 02:11:47.657]  And then Mark popped in my ear and said, that's obviously a recording.
[02:11:48.678 --> 02:11:52.882]  And yeah, right as he said that, I was starting to pick up on the fact these were movie clips.
[02:11:56.901 --> 02:11:58.883]  Mark in Minnesota, go ahead, last caller.
[02:11:59.343 --> 02:11:59.803]  Hey, Alex.
[02:12:00.043 --> 02:12:01.084]  Yeah, that was pretty wild.
[02:12:01.845 --> 02:12:04.727]  You actually got to interview Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:12:05.527 --> 02:12:09.430]  But, yeah, you're absolutely right about these infiltrators.
[02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:20.978]  In fact, what's really interesting, I happen to know a former national campaign manager for Alan Keyes, and he actually told me that, you know,
[02:12:22.677 --> 02:12:27.141]  He did not believe Alan Keyes ever ran for president to actually get elected.
[02:12:27.221 --> 02:12:29.142]  It was actually to promote his book.
[02:12:31.324 --> 02:12:41.092]  In fact, what's interesting, you'd go back and look at some of Keyes' rhetoric, and he would reserve his most brutal attacks for people like Pat Buchanan.
[02:12:41.933 --> 02:12:49.379]  Then Bob Dole or somebody would get a free pass on some really far-out physician.
[02:12:50.353 --> 02:12:57.778]  That really what they're good at is, they might identify part of the problem, but they will not discuss solutions.
[02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:00.440]  Well that's it.
[02:13:00.941 --> 02:13:07.185]  And the big solution is first getting people to realize the fraud you just articulated so easily.
[02:13:07.205 --> 02:13:09.086]  Stay there, I'll let you finish up.
[02:13:09.126 --> 02:13:12.369]  That's it for calls today because I gotta cover some of this news.
[02:13:13.489 --> 02:13:15.431]  My brain is reeling from all this.
[02:13:17.137 --> 02:13:25.761]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:13:25.981 --> 02:13:37.247]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:13:37.487 --> 02:13:40.108]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:13:40.448 --> 02:13:44.550]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:13:44.770 --> 02:13:46.911]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:13:47.071 --> 02:13:48.933]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:13:49.133 --> 02:13:55.156]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:13:55.416 --> 02:14:01.080]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:05.343]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:14:06.084 --> 02:14:06.784]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:24.472]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[02:14:54.104 --> 02:14:54.344]  I think so.
[02:15:16.215 --> 02:15:20.478]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[02:15:20.918 --> 02:15:25.461]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[02:15:25.841 --> 02:15:30.764]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[02:15:31.084 --> 02:15:32.865]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[02:15:32.925 --> 02:15:33.946]  can barely be read.
[02:15:34.246 --> 02:15:35.187]  It has faded that much.
[02:15:35.547 --> 02:15:39.448]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[02:15:39.708 --> 02:15:48.089]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.

[02:16:16.284 --> 02:16:17.304]  What would you rather do?
[02:16:17.645 --> 02:16:20.566]  Spend 10 minutes learning how to become debt-free within two years?
[02:16:20.826 --> 02:16:23.066]  Or spend the next 30 years wishing you had?

[02:16:44.574 --> 02:16:45.195]  We're good to go.
[02:17:13.255 --> 02:17:15.036]  Don't consolidate, eliminate.
[02:17:18.777 --> 02:17:24.799]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:17:25.419 --> 02:17:28.440]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:29.901 --> 02:17:37.183]  Alright, finishing up with Mark in Minnesota, talking about phonies, left wing, right wing phonies.
[02:17:37.803 --> 02:17:38.924]  They're all over the place.
[02:17:39.604 --> 02:17:41.185]  Go ahead in finishing up your comment.
[02:17:43.001 --> 02:17:49.005]  I recently had a chance to discuss Gulf War Syndrome, the second Gulf War Syndrome.
[02:17:49.625 --> 02:17:50.926]  By the way, I believe it's from the shots.
[02:17:51.146 --> 02:18:00.912]  A young lady who died from a similar pneumonia-like illness just after receiving the shots, but before she deployed back in April, Rachel Lacey.
[02:18:01.372 --> 02:18:05.214]  But I had a chance to talk to some Republicans about Gulf War Syndrome, too.
[02:18:06.275 --> 02:18:09.157]  And you know what their reaction was?
[02:18:09.377 --> 02:18:12.579]  I mean, pretty much they just said, what, are you a liberal?
[02:18:13.616 --> 02:18:16.980]  And, uh, you know, are you a communist or something like that?
[02:18:17.481 --> 02:18:23.187]  And I'm just thinking, whoa, yeah, I didn't talk about anything else other than, you know, pretty much Gulf War syndrome in the shots.
[02:18:23.846 --> 02:18:28.909]  Well, now they admit that the first troops were given a dangerous vaccine that had been banned.
[02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:34.271]  They now admit they were hit with nerve gas from the bunkers that were blown up and were not given treatment.
[02:18:34.331 --> 02:18:36.912]  But, you see, we're supposed to... Well, that was then.
[02:18:37.073 --> 02:18:37.533]  Shut up.
[02:18:37.873 --> 02:18:39.114]  No, I've told you, Mark.
[02:18:39.134 --> 02:18:44.296]  Supporting the troops... Hey, supporting the troops means waving a plastic flag.
[02:18:45.116 --> 02:18:45.957]  Made in China.
[02:18:46.057 --> 02:18:48.338]  It means cutting their pay.
[02:18:48.498 --> 02:18:48.998]  It means...
[02:18:51.405 --> 02:18:53.928]  Just mindlessly supporting the empire?
[02:18:54.228 --> 02:18:58.872]  Yeah, see, this is exactly what one of their tactics is.
[02:18:59.032 --> 02:19:01.515]  In fact, you'll notice, like, of course, I don't really listen to them.
[02:19:01.675 --> 02:19:05.979]  In fact, I don't listen to them, but back when I used to, I would notice, like Rush Limbaugh.
[02:19:06.339 --> 02:19:11.785]  Say you had a Democrat that would come out and say, oh, you know, there are kids in poverty, we need some government program.
[02:19:12.583 --> 02:19:23.552]  Well, what Rush would do is he would come out and say, no, kids aren't in poverty, everything is perfect, and if you suggest that kids are in poverty, you're just a liberal.
[02:19:23.652 --> 02:19:32.699]  So rather than saying, no, we shouldn't expand government, the real problem is that you don't believe we're in a utopia.
[02:19:33.199 --> 02:19:37.863]  And this, Alex, is what the Republican Party and these neocons are all about.
[02:19:38.419 --> 02:19:45.434]  They are there to tell you that we're in utopia, and anybody who denies that we're in utopia, Alex, is a liberal.
[02:19:46.246 --> 02:19:46.906]  Well, that's it.
[02:19:46.986 --> 02:19:52.569]  And then the liberals go to all the disenfranchised growing mass and say, we're not in a utopia.
[02:19:52.949 --> 02:19:54.049]  Government's the answer.
[02:19:54.290 --> 02:19:59.612]  So either way, they capture you, the middle classes in La La Land, as they're being dismantled.
[02:19:59.932 --> 02:20:05.555]  And you've got all the larger group of poor people hearing, no, we're going to take care of you.
[02:20:05.615 --> 02:20:08.676]  By the way, take the guns from those middle class people, will you?
[02:20:09.369 --> 02:20:16.632]  Now you tell the middle-class utopians, hey, Bush wants your guns and open borders, they say, let them eat cake!
[02:20:17.233 --> 02:20:21.555]  And again, okay, then you're in for a rough ride, but here's the problem.
[02:20:22.895 --> 02:20:30.399]  Whenever a middle-class person sees their neighbor go down, in this economy, in this society, they just say, well, that's just them.
[02:20:30.579 --> 02:20:34.140]  I've got to keep up appearances as if I'm doing real well.
[02:20:35.834 --> 02:20:38.336]  It's mind control alright.
[02:20:38.457 --> 02:20:43.841]  Right, so the first step to reaching a solution is to admit there's a problem.
[02:20:43.982 --> 02:20:53.510]  Yes, there are a lot of false solutions, but there is a problem and it doesn't make you a liberal to suggest that we're in something other than utopia.
[02:20:54.571 --> 02:20:57.194]  Look, they have trouble with this whole liberal thing.
[02:20:58.368 --> 02:21:03.912]  They got all the neocons on TV saying Arnold Schwarzenegger is the second coming, okay?
[02:21:04.613 --> 02:21:06.294]  Who cares if he's a Nazi?
[02:21:06.334 --> 02:21:08.076]  Who cares if he wants your guns?
[02:21:08.556 --> 02:21:15.341]  The neocons are on radio and TV for him saying, vote for him, you gotta stop the liberals.
[02:21:15.782 --> 02:21:16.582]  The liberals?
[02:21:16.642 --> 02:21:17.403]  He is one!
[02:21:18.484 --> 02:21:20.986]  So this shows how it's a false fight.
[02:21:21.599 --> 02:21:28.382]  It's gotten, I know, it's everywhere and people, you're right, they're so mind-controlled and they don't even realize it.
[02:21:28.422 --> 02:21:31.363]  They've been indoctrinated and brainwashed.
[02:21:31.744 --> 02:21:34.645]  Did you hear my story of last week I'm getting my car cleaned?
[02:21:34.985 --> 02:21:35.745]  Yeah, I heard that.
[02:21:36.006 --> 02:21:39.607]  And for those that didn't, a guy walks over and says, what are you reading?
[02:21:39.647 --> 02:21:41.588]  And I said, I'm reading Order Out of Chaos.
[02:21:42.188 --> 02:21:43.209]  He said, oh, what's it about?
[02:21:43.229 --> 02:21:46.010]  And I said, well, it's about corrupt government.
[02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:47.971]  And he said, well,
[02:21:48.681 --> 02:21:49.721]  I don't believe in that.
[02:21:49.941 --> 02:21:51.482]  And I said, well, you don't believe in history?
[02:21:52.282 --> 02:21:53.262]  And he said, well, what's it about?
[02:21:53.302 --> 02:21:57.683]  And I said, well, it's, you know, about how they want to put implantable microchips in it.
[02:21:57.903 --> 02:22:03.124]  And he started laughing at me, and some woman said, yeah, I heard about that, but what are you, crazy?
[02:22:03.704 --> 02:22:04.704]  Because I was, see?
[02:22:04.724 --> 02:22:06.045]  I mean, that's nuts!
[02:22:06.365 --> 02:22:10.206]  They admit they heard about it, but I'm crazy for talking about it.
[02:22:10.246 --> 02:22:11.546]  I mean, whoa!
[02:22:12.182 --> 02:22:14.383]  Well, this is a good thing, Alex.
[02:22:14.643 --> 02:22:21.206]  I think that the police state, this control grid, it's a wonderful, conservative thing, Alex.
[02:22:21.406 --> 02:22:23.387]  You're just a liberal.
[02:22:23.687 --> 02:22:24.207]  God bless you.
[02:22:24.247 --> 02:22:27.329]  I got a copy of your book in the mail today, A Dissent and a Tyranny.
[02:22:27.889 --> 02:22:29.149]  It looks like it's going to be a great read.
[02:22:29.209 --> 02:22:31.050]  God bless you and death to the New World Order.
[02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:32.511]  Well, thank you for the support.
[02:22:33.596 --> 02:22:35.537]  Yeah, it's a great book I wrote.
[02:22:35.697 --> 02:22:36.598]  12 bucks, 230 pages.
[02:22:36.618 --> 02:22:38.159]  I want to thank all those that have gotten it.
[02:22:38.179 --> 02:22:39.900]  If you haven't gotten it, you should.
[02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:41.801]  But now, I've printed another book.
[02:22:41.841 --> 02:22:42.321]  I didn't write it.
[02:22:42.341 --> 02:22:43.102]  Paul Watson did.
[02:22:43.662 --> 02:22:44.723]  It's Order Out of Chaos.
[02:22:44.743 --> 02:22:47.044]  330-something pages long.
[02:22:48.385 --> 02:22:49.306]  It's 1995.
[02:22:49.826 --> 02:22:50.606]  Order Out of Chaos.
[02:22:50.666 --> 02:22:52.628]  Elite-sponsored terrorism in the New World Order.
[02:22:52.648 --> 02:22:55.770]  You need to have Order Out of Chaos, folks.
[02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:56.390]  And you know what?
[02:22:56.410 --> 02:22:57.791]  I haven't plugged it in about an hour and a half.
[02:22:58.411 --> 02:23:02.374]  I'll do that briefly when we get back, and then I'll get into all the news we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:23:02.394 --> 02:23:02.814]  Stay with us.
[02:23:06.483 --> 02:23:09.485]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:23:10.386 --> 02:23:13.188]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:16.611 --> 02:23:19.213]  Hardly a day goes by in the garden without the CobraHead.
[02:23:19.373 --> 02:23:22.295]  I want to tell you about a great little garden tool called the CobraHead.
[02:23:22.436 --> 02:23:27.640]  First, take half of the tools you're currently using in the garden, throw them away, and call 1-800-AWARD-TODAY.COM or call today 800-251-1991.
[02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:28.740]  Don't consolidate, eliminate.
[02:23:47.625 --> 02:23:51.826]  Alright, my friends.
[02:23:51.866 --> 02:23:52.726]  We're back live.
[02:23:52.746 --> 02:23:55.127]  Jumping right into some of the news we haven't detailed yet.
[02:23:56.467 --> 02:23:59.188]  South Korea fires on North Korean boat.
[02:24:00.288 --> 02:24:09.231]  Inside of ABC News of Australia, South Korea warships fired warning shots at a North Korean vessel in the Yellow Sea.
[02:24:09.251 --> 02:24:16.853]  According to Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff, the 10-ton North Korean boat crossed into South Korean waters this afternoon.
[02:24:18.294 --> 02:24:24.138]  There's also a giant U.S.-South Korean drill going on in the waters right now.
[02:24:25.539 --> 02:24:29.802]  Russia's Pacific Fleet launches major exercises in Far East.
[02:24:31.844 --> 02:24:37.188]  Russia's Pacific Fleet launched large-scale exercises in Russia's Far East Monday, Navy officials said.
[02:24:37.588 --> 02:24:47.035]  Besides the Pacific Fleet, the exercises would involve troops of the Far Eastern military bases, border guards, police rescue agencies, and security search, as officials say.
[02:24:47.722 --> 02:25:06.371]  Total of 75 warships, over 20 aircraft, and 30,000 soldiers and experts would be included in the operation, which has no precedent in the history of the Russian Navy by scale, diversity of its participants, and the space-covered officials added.
[02:25:07.091 --> 02:25:16.136]  South Korean and Japanese ships and planes would also take part in the exercise, which would be monitored by experts from the United States, Canada, China, and North Korea.
[02:25:16.176 --> 02:25:16.876]  What does that mean?
[02:25:19.770 --> 02:25:23.412]  A lot of bizarre stuff going on in this whole power grid thing.
[02:25:23.512 --> 02:25:24.653]  That'll centralize.
[02:25:24.693 --> 02:25:26.254]  That'll grow the federal control.
[02:25:26.274 --> 02:25:29.155]  Oh, the terrorists might strike our power.
[02:25:29.735 --> 02:25:32.657]  Now we might need to have troops at all the power stations.
[02:25:33.197 --> 02:25:35.839]  Lots of troops training you to accept troops.
[02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:39.661]  They're calling it an exclusive.
[02:25:39.741 --> 02:25:45.344]  Why, they've broken a news story that was broken by the New York Daily News two weeks ago.
[02:25:48.169 --> 02:25:54.171]  Eight months ago on this show, but exclusive, Ashcroft's campaign to shore up the Patriot Act.
[02:25:54.811 --> 02:25:58.732]  I mean, it may have been unannounced months ago, but it was obvious he was pushing a campaign.
[02:25:59.452 --> 02:26:06.754]  Attorney General John Ashcroft this week will launch a cross-country brainstorming tour designed to shore up support for the USA Patriot Act.
[02:26:06.794 --> 02:26:14.176]  The controversial measure passed after 9-1-1 giving the Justice Department broad new powers to combat terrorism.
[02:26:15.945 --> 02:26:19.947]  You mean to combat the Bill of Rights and ensure that your terrorist attacks go off without a hitch?
[02:26:20.007 --> 02:26:20.327]  Okay.
[02:26:23.009 --> 02:26:34.414]  Over the next three weeks, Ashcroft plans to swoop into 18 cities, give speeches, meet local officials, and grant select press interviews, touting department success using a law.
[02:26:35.135 --> 02:26:40.137]  In a conference call and emails last week, sources tell Newsweek the country's 94 U.S.
[02:26:40.177 --> 02:26:41.558]  attorneys were instructed to help
[02:26:42.339 --> 02:26:57.128]  Gain support by convincing community meetings, write up ed articles and local newspapers, and ensuring that uninformed cops are seated in the bleachers behind the AG during his visits.
[02:26:59.849 --> 02:27:09.615]  Of course, out of Freudian slip, it says, and by ensuring that uniformed cops are seated in the bleachers behind the AG, Attorney General, during his visits.
[02:27:11.633 --> 02:27:18.157]  Yeah, uninformed cops ordered to sit there behind the Attorney General to give us the illusion of local police.
[02:27:18.257 --> 02:27:21.379]  People, you know, you can trust the Nazi Party.
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:29.765]  We're here to help you and we're hiring local police from your Austrian government to make up the backbone of the new SS.
[02:27:31.766 --> 02:27:32.907]  Oh, that's another story.
[02:27:33.867 --> 02:27:38.250]  But let's break down what's really going on here.
[02:27:41.707 --> 02:27:43.307]  Bush went to St.
[02:27:43.367 --> 02:27:48.568]  Louis and they had the boxes that said Made in the U.S.A.
[02:27:48.648 --> 02:27:58.230]  stenciled on them where somebody with, you know, 30, 45 vision could read it at 50 yards away.
[02:27:59.131 --> 02:28:01.071]  And then they zoomed in on the actual boxes.
[02:28:01.091 --> 02:28:02.191]  They said, Made in China.
[02:28:02.511 --> 02:28:06.132]  It's a felony to mislabel stuff at a warehouse, but hey, who cares?
[02:28:06.152 --> 02:28:09.633]  You know, that's for the general public, not the Führer.
[02:28:10.033 --> 02:28:11.313]  The Führer can't do any wrong.
[02:28:12.990 --> 02:28:15.451]  The idiot Fuhrer, the little puppet head.
[02:28:16.672 --> 02:28:18.552]  And so, we had all that develop.
[02:28:19.833 --> 02:28:27.996]  Then Bush was in Indiana a few months later, and they warned everybody in this big arena, take your ties off, or you're going to be taken out by the Secret Service.
[02:28:28.036 --> 02:28:29.457]  Now, that was in the Associated Press.
[02:28:29.837 --> 02:28:35.859]  He will be thrown out of this building if you do not, they got all the speakers, take your ties off.
[02:28:35.959 --> 02:28:40.881]  And then a bunch of people didn't, so they came back on and said, take them off now or you'll be thrown out.
[02:28:41.802 --> 02:28:42.422]  So they did.
[02:28:43.646 --> 02:28:50.469]  Because Bush didn't want the image of lots of men wearing ties, giving orders.
[02:28:54.331 --> 02:28:57.092]  And so, that's what happened there.
[02:28:59.694 --> 02:29:01.855]  And this weekend, I'm again watching some more TV.
[02:29:01.915 --> 02:29:05.677]  I've been watching a long time, spending some time on vacation, watching a little TV.
[02:29:08.518 --> 02:29:10.299]  And I'm there watching it.
[02:29:11.483 --> 02:29:16.744]  It's Bush out at some national monument, and they've got Forest Service workers behind him.
[02:29:16.864 --> 02:29:18.324]  I mean, two feet behind him!
[02:29:20.105 --> 02:29:23.685]  And the sound of crunching dirt as they're digging with spades and shovels.
[02:29:24.226 --> 02:29:26.546]  And you can tell they have the ground microphone.
[02:29:26.646 --> 02:29:36.688]  I mean, the crunching of the dirt was louder than the President talking, and he was having his press conference about getting America back to work and upgrading the power system and how
[02:29:37.398 --> 02:29:40.740]  You know, he'd been for this all along, and here was people right behind him.
[02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:49.325]  I mean, two feet behind him in Forest Service outfits, old gray-haired Forest Service workers, you know, all the head folks, in a staged photo op.
[02:29:49.485 --> 02:29:52.787]  Oh, look, the Fuhrer's out, and look at all the work going on.
[02:29:52.807 --> 02:29:54.448]  Look at how your government works for you.
[02:29:54.468 --> 02:30:00.631]  Can you imagine him ordering the Forest Service people, here, stand behind the President and dig?
[02:30:03.533 --> 02:30:04.674]  Will you do that for us?
[02:30:07.401 --> 02:30:08.262]  Think about that!
[02:30:08.902 --> 02:30:09.783]  Think about that!
[02:30:10.984 --> 02:30:18.670]  So, maybe you like phoniness, but I just thought of that reading where they're going to have uniformed cops.
[02:30:19.351 --> 02:30:22.173]  They've instructed all the country's 94 U.S.
[02:30:22.213 --> 02:30:26.977]  Attorneys to go order the local police, I guess, to sit behind the Attorney General.
[02:30:27.497 --> 02:30:30.380]  Why Ashcroft and his top aides are worried
[02:30:31.539 --> 02:30:32.079]  We're good to go.
[02:30:52.210 --> 02:30:54.271]  Justice alarming was last month's lopsided U.S.
[02:30:54.311 --> 02:31:00.474]  House vote, forbidding justice from spending funds to use the act's controversial sneak-and-peek provision.
[02:31:00.854 --> 02:31:05.716]  The authorities authorized federal agents to conduct secret searches of homes and businesses.
[02:31:06.316 --> 02:31:14.980]  Alarm that the Anti-Patriot Act movement was spiraling and might torpedo internal justice plans for even more expansive anti-terrorism proposals.
[02:31:15.440 --> 02:31:16.681]  Ashcroft aides included.
[02:31:17.041 --> 02:31:18.221]  They need to strike back.
[02:31:18.842 --> 02:31:21.763]  One method, said an official, was to roll out Ashcroft.
[02:31:24.532 --> 02:31:25.953]  Okay, let's give you the numbers.
[02:31:26.113 --> 02:31:29.294]  It's three states by another ten, a bunch of conservative states.
[02:31:29.454 --> 02:31:31.435]  It's over 400 cities and towns.
[02:31:33.416 --> 02:31:37.718]  And he went to Alaska and asked them not to pass it and they still did.
[02:31:38.858 --> 02:31:39.738]  Conservative state.
[02:31:40.839 --> 02:31:45.601]  By the way, why isn't the media calling him on the carpet for being a big fat liar?
[02:31:47.442 --> 02:31:52.784]  He said there wasn't a Patriot Act due months after it was introduced officially.
[02:31:53.641 --> 02:32:00.443]  He says there was no new terror legislation, and he's now rolled out the Victory Act, so we've got multiple new Patriots.
[02:32:02.884 --> 02:32:05.505]  By the way, all that stuff's on Infowars.com if you want to read it.
[02:32:06.325 --> 02:32:18.309]  The anxiety of justice is intensified by the fact that the anti-Patriot Act campaign is being driven by a coalition that includes such diverse groups as the ACLU and Phyllis Schaaf-Lee's The Eagle Forum, the House sponsor
[02:32:19.543 --> 02:32:37.536]  Of the anti-Sneak and Peek amendment, for example, is GOP representative Butch Otter, an Idaho conservative, who's under major pressure by his constituents, who told Newsweek his concerns were heightened when anti-abortion groups warned that abortion protesters could be targeted as domestic terrorists.
[02:32:37.596 --> 02:32:42.459]  Justice officials say Otter and his supporters are grotesquely distorting what the law does.
[02:32:42.479 --> 02:32:44.601]  Hey, you're a liar again!
[02:32:46.641 --> 02:32:48.442]  We've read the thing on the air, folks.
[02:32:48.762 --> 02:32:49.523]  One and two.
[02:32:50.843 --> 02:32:52.944]  Large subsections of it on air.
[02:32:54.205 --> 02:32:57.727]  It allows them to arrest you secretly for any reason.
[02:32:58.688 --> 02:33:00.649]  Take you to an undisclosed location.
[02:33:00.749 --> 02:33:01.509]  Torture you.
[02:33:02.590 --> 02:33:03.690]  Blow your head off.
[02:33:03.950 --> 02:33:04.971]  Lethal inject you.
[02:33:06.428 --> 02:33:10.470]  And bury you, cremate you, you'll never be seen again.
[02:33:10.490 --> 02:33:28.840]  Now, it says it, I announced it, people couldn't believe it, then it came out in the news, okay, there are secret death camps, and for your safety, of course, and yes, they're going to secretly arrest citizens for any reason, and now the Justice Department, in a brief to Congress, admits it will be used against all criminals for all crimes.
[02:33:30.981 --> 02:33:32.161]  And suspected crimes.
[02:33:32.482 --> 02:33:33.362]  I'm sick of it!
[02:33:41.559 --> 02:33:42.280]  Now listen to this.
[02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:44.081]  This is out of the RFID Journal.
[02:33:44.901 --> 02:33:48.404]  And it's a journal paid for by the RFID Consortium in the Pentagon.
[02:33:50.385 --> 02:33:51.766]  And their documents have been released.
[02:33:51.826 --> 02:33:52.967]  We broke the story on air.
[02:33:53.447 --> 02:34:04.135]  Now it's been in all the big newspapers that, yeah, the government secretly met with the heads of corporations, that we're a cashless society, implantable microchip, tracker grid, and all goods and services out there.
[02:34:05.692 --> 02:34:12.034]  The money you pay with, the stuff you buy, Gillette razors, clothes, shoes, everything!
[02:34:12.755 --> 02:34:13.515]  Campbell's suit.
[02:34:15.996 --> 02:34:17.056]  And they've announced it.
[02:34:17.996 --> 02:34:21.097]  Then there was a protest, and they said, OK, we're not going to do it.
[02:34:22.438 --> 02:34:26.779]  Well, again, I said, if you believe that, I've got a bridge I'll be more than happy to sell you.
[02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:29.580]  Walmart expands RFID mandate.
[02:34:29.921 --> 02:34:33.622]  The world's largest retailer says that it will ask all suppliers to tag
[02:34:34.361 --> 02:34:36.943]  Pallets and cases by the end of 2006.
[02:34:36.983 --> 02:34:42.087]  Now, they had said they were going to do it all Walmarts by next year.
[02:34:43.809 --> 02:34:55.818]  And it says, if anyone still doubts that Walmart is serious about deploying, deploying RFID technology in its supply chain, they should be dispelled by its latest revelation.
[02:34:56.239 --> 02:35:02.824]  The world's largest retailer says it will require all suppliers put RFID tags carrying electronic product
[02:35:03.504 --> 02:35:26.516]  By the end of 2006, we have asked our 100 top suppliers to have product on pallets employing RFID chips, and in cases with RFID chips, says Walmart spokesman Tom Williams, by 2006 we will roll N out with all suppliers.
[02:35:26.536 --> 02:35:27.116]  That's what it says.
[02:35:27.156 --> 02:35:29.157]  We will roll it out with all suppliers.
[02:35:31.992 --> 02:35:48.685]  And it says Linda Dillman, Walmart's CIO, publicly announced in June that the retailer, now listen to this, the retailer would ask its top suppliers to attack pallets and cases beginning in January 2005.
[02:35:49.065 --> 02:35:55.050]  And of course, individual goods is what they tried to roll out last month and there was a protest.
[02:35:56.855 --> 02:35:57.755]  So that's pretty serious.
[02:35:57.775 --> 02:36:02.697]  And here's a bizarre article out of the Silicon Valley Business Journal.
[02:36:04.238 --> 02:36:08.999]  Backers of RFID chips banking on alien concept.
[02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:21.624]  The prediction that one day every consumer product will include an electronic tracking chip in every movement from manufacturer, plant, to store, shelf, and beyond may be as sci-fi as it sounds.
[02:36:21.724 --> 02:36:23.164]  May not be as sci-fi as it sounds.
[02:36:23.685 --> 02:36:24.285]  At least that's
[02:36:25.433 --> 02:36:30.255]  What more than a dozen investors in Morgan Hill-based Alien Technology Corp are hoping?
[02:36:31.996 --> 02:36:37.959]  That goes in to talk about how... how they're selling this to everybody.
[02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:42.442]  It's called Alien Technologies and they're symbols of flying saucer.
[02:36:44.563 --> 02:36:45.063]  Oh man.
[02:36:46.904 --> 02:36:49.145]  Continuing here with all this news.
[02:36:50.311 --> 02:36:50.611]  U.S.
[02:36:50.651 --> 02:36:53.594]  descent signaled to North Koreans in naval exercise.
[02:36:53.614 --> 02:36:55.996]  Yeah, they're shooting at North Korean vessels right now.
[02:36:57.477 --> 02:37:13.910]  Now, the Bush administration, while preparing for talks soon with North Korea, is also stepping up military pressure with plans for a joint naval exercise next month to train for interdicting at sea arms and other materials being transported to and from the North.
[02:37:15.100 --> 02:37:18.942]  We've read the mainstream reports where Rumsfeld purposefully leaked his battle plans for September or October.
[02:37:45.126 --> 02:37:51.111]  To get vessels pre-deployed over there to preemptively strike.
[02:37:52.091 --> 02:37:53.292]  First they release this.
[02:37:53.913 --> 02:37:54.954]  Now they're deploying.
[02:37:56.195 --> 02:38:00.518]  And this is trying to push the North into doing something stupid.
[02:38:01.979 --> 02:38:02.640]  What are you?
[02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:04.701]  Do you support North Korea?
[02:38:04.881 --> 02:38:05.682]  No, I don't.
[02:38:06.282 --> 02:38:09.305]  I'm just saying they're staging a war with these psychopaths, okay?
[02:38:10.145 --> 02:38:12.407]  And the people running this country are just as evil.
[02:38:12.787 --> 02:38:14.729]  In fact, they're more sophisticated, okay?
[02:38:15.717 --> 02:38:20.121]  They're not four and a half feet tall, running around gobbling caviar drunk.
[02:38:20.901 --> 02:38:24.384]  They want to dehumanize everybody, and are taking their time doing it.
[02:38:27.487 --> 02:38:32.951]  West Virginia police step up patrols after sniper-style shootings, got another one of those happening.
[02:38:34.272 --> 02:38:35.113]  Sure, it's the government.
[02:38:35.633 --> 02:38:44.661]  They have Northwood's plan, the official government plan, to carry out sniper attacks to get martial law in America, and even how to frame patsies, in the Northwood's plan.
[02:38:46.751 --> 02:38:49.153]  22 die in Taliban attack on police station.
[02:38:50.614 --> 02:38:52.256]  At least 22 people died.
[02:38:54.337 --> 02:38:58.821]  When hundreds of suspected Taliban fighters seized control of a police station in southern Afghanistan.
[02:38:59.621 --> 02:39:02.904]  At the weekend, one of the most serious attacks against the government for a year.
[02:39:02.924 --> 02:39:08.908]  At least 400 everly armed gunmen poured into Bar Mal, 125 miles southeast of Kabul.
[02:39:11.425 --> 02:39:20.310]  Late on Saturday, in a convoy of trucks, Mohammed al-Jawli, the governor of Pakistani province, said that they had come across the Pakistani border five miles away.
[02:39:20.390 --> 02:39:23.051]  By the way, Pakistan's run by the CIA, folks.
[02:39:24.412 --> 02:39:27.693]  Our government's happy for them to have nukes and help arm them.
[02:39:28.794 --> 02:39:29.474]  But that's okay.
[02:39:29.494 --> 02:39:38.379]  The head of their intelligence agency met with the heads of the House and Senate the morning of September 11th, while it was happening, and he wired $100,000 to Mohammed Adda.
[02:39:39.599 --> 02:39:41.100]  And now they're supposedly attacking.
[02:39:42.410 --> 02:39:43.511]  Oh, this is ridiculous.
[02:39:44.151 --> 02:39:48.454]  Bush blamed for chaos, which led to blackouts.
[02:39:48.694 --> 02:39:49.835]  Bush didn't do anything.
[02:39:49.915 --> 02:39:50.756]  Bush is a puppet.
[02:39:51.977 --> 02:40:03.865]  This is out of The Independent saying he blocked reforms that would have made the power system not go down by allowing centralization and consolidation and price cutting and so-called privatization.
[02:40:04.770 --> 02:40:07.011]  Which is true, but again, Bush didn't do anything.
[02:40:07.071 --> 02:40:09.332]  Bush reads off a teleprompter, folks.
[02:40:09.552 --> 02:40:12.234]  Stop having the illusion that he's our president.
[02:40:13.655 --> 02:40:15.596]  The guy couldn't even finish his flight training.
[02:40:18.497 --> 02:40:21.919]  Continuing here, a bunch of other news that are very, very important.
[02:40:22.619 --> 02:40:24.480]  A story came out about Dr. David Kelly.
[02:40:27.001 --> 02:40:28.242]  And Dr. David Kelly
[02:40:29.598 --> 02:40:38.704]  It turns out, was seen by one of his neighbors a mile from home right before he supposedly died, laughing and joking and happily talking to his neighbor.
[02:40:39.565 --> 02:40:48.931]  Again, he talked about dark actors, people that have been threatening him, problems he'd been having, and that certainly ended up happening there in the end, didn't it?
[02:40:54.775 --> 02:40:56.876]  Also, there's this Reuters journalist
[02:40:58.206 --> 02:41:01.668]  Who was wearing the helmet with the red stickers on it and everything.
[02:41:01.708 --> 02:41:03.409]  And he even took photos.
[02:41:06.231 --> 02:41:08.252]  He even took photos of the tanks rolling up.
[02:41:08.312 --> 02:41:09.013]  He was unarmed.
[02:41:09.913 --> 02:41:10.954]  And they just shot him.
[02:41:10.974 --> 02:41:11.914]  That's what they do now.
[02:41:13.275 --> 02:41:14.516]  And I have the other article here.
[02:41:14.796 --> 02:41:15.717]  This was from AFP.
[02:41:15.837 --> 02:41:22.761]  I have the other article here where they admit that our military was ordered to kill reporters to get them out of the way.
[02:41:24.122 --> 02:41:25.523]  So cold-blooded murder folks.
[02:41:25.683 --> 02:41:26.043]  Okay.
[02:41:28.148 --> 02:41:31.231]  We'll talk about study, 9-1-1 style attack on U.S.
[02:41:31.311 --> 02:41:31.751]  likely.
[02:41:35.554 --> 02:41:42.940]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:43.220 --> 02:41:47.963]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:48.184 --> 02:41:53.828]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:54.048 --> 02:41:58.595]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:41:58.775 --> 02:42:05.966]  Attached was society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:42:05.986 --> 02:42:09.411]  soil, the USAID Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[02:42:09.431 --> 02:42:09.711]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:34.258 --> 02:42:37.739]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:42:37.999 --> 02:42:41.501]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:42:41.581 --> 02:42:45.542]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:42:45.742 --> 02:42:51.924]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:52.324 --> 02:43:00.227]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:43:00.647 --> 02:43:05.991]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:43:06.151 --> 02:43:09.914]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:43:10.294 --> 02:43:12.136]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:43:12.216 --> 02:43:14.378]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:43:14.618 --> 02:43:19.561]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:43:19.601 --> 02:43:25.146]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:44:41.969 --> 02:44:44.771]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:47.753 --> 02:44:49.113]  Alright, final segment.
[02:44:49.334 --> 02:44:50.934]  There's a bunch of news we didn't get to.
[02:44:51.015 --> 02:44:53.756]  It's online at infowars.com.
[02:44:55.257 --> 02:44:58.058]  Study 9-1-1 style attack on U.S.
[02:44:58.239 --> 02:44:58.719]  likely.
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:06.942]  So, you see, they study this, and then the globalists say the terrorists are going to get you, we're going to have to totally enslave you, okay?
[02:45:07.582 --> 02:45:10.102]  And then the terrorists attack, and we go, oh, you're so smart!
[02:45:10.643 --> 02:45:12.543]  We'll have to let you run our lives now.
[02:45:12.563 --> 02:45:16.644]  Never mind that you're connected to all the terrorists, up one side and down the other.
[02:45:17.004 --> 02:45:18.604]  We'll just be mindless idiots!
[02:45:20.125 --> 02:45:24.726]  Another September 11th-style terrorism attack is highly likely in the United States, which ranks fourth.
[02:45:26.821 --> 02:45:49.272]  In an index assessing the risk of 186 countries, a research company said Sunday, London-based World Markets Research Center ranked Colombia, Israel, Pakistan, and the United States as the most likely to descend into order or disorder, as the five countries most likely to be targeted in a terrorist attack in the next 12 months.
[02:45:51.032 --> 02:45:54.374]  And it's the company's World Terrorism Index said in a telephone interview.
[02:45:55.504 --> 02:45:57.186]  And the CFR is saying the same thing.
[02:45:57.206 --> 02:45:58.126]  We're going to get nuked.
[02:45:58.266 --> 02:45:59.968]  We're going to get smallpoxed.
[02:46:00.008 --> 02:46:00.769]  But don't worry.
[02:46:01.149 --> 02:46:03.611]  They're ready to totally enslave you to keep you safe.
[02:46:06.013 --> 02:46:08.515]  There's a story out of United Press International.
[02:46:08.735 --> 02:46:10.817]  Walker's World trading with the enemy.
[02:46:11.978 --> 02:46:16.562]  And it says world trade is growing at 6% this year.
[02:46:17.143 --> 02:46:21.406]  That's more than it did in the happy, booming 96 of recent memory.
[02:46:21.426 --> 02:46:21.987]  And after the
[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:29.564]  Unexciting 3% growth last year and a 1.5% shrinkage of dismal 2001.
[02:46:30.004 --> 02:46:31.885]  It should be cause to celebrate.
[02:46:31.905 --> 02:46:38.789]  It should also be grounds for optimism about next month's World Trade Organization Summit in Cancun, Mexico.
[02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:45.093]  So it's just, man, the WTO is going to save us, United Press International says.
[02:46:45.113 --> 02:46:47.214]  Isn't that nice?
[02:46:48.712 --> 02:46:49.513]  Here's another one.
[02:46:49.633 --> 02:46:50.954]  How to be gay.
[02:46:51.355 --> 02:46:53.356]  Can't use the scientific word homosexual.
[02:46:53.376 --> 02:46:54.177]  That's a thought crime.
[02:46:55.198 --> 02:46:56.119]  How to be gay.
[02:46:56.679 --> 02:46:58.261]  Course draws fire at Michigan.
[02:46:58.881 --> 02:46:59.702]  Washington Times.
[02:46:59.762 --> 02:47:01.143]  A course called How to Be Gay.
[02:47:01.404 --> 02:47:03.646]  Male Homosexuality and Initiation.
[02:47:04.266 --> 02:47:05.187]  Scheduled this fall.
[02:47:05.247 --> 02:47:07.449]  Has redefined a culture war.
[02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:09.411]  University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
[02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:20.829]  A family's value lobbyist is leading public opposition to the self-proclaimed uncompromising political militancy of the professor who teaches lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender.
[02:47:21.889 --> 02:47:22.790]  And it goes on and on.
[02:47:22.810 --> 02:47:25.493]  They're going to teach the young people how to do all this.
[02:47:26.994 --> 02:47:28.495]  Again, just destroy the family.
[02:47:30.557 --> 02:47:31.458]  Destroy the family.
[02:47:31.478 --> 02:47:35.521]  Arnold Schwarzenegger and his type of neo-con trash totally support this.
[02:47:36.902 --> 02:47:38.383]  We're out of time, my friends.
[02:47:40.293 --> 02:47:43.855]  But we'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight central and back tomorrow 11 to 2.
[02:47:43.935 --> 02:47:49.899]  I want to thank all the great listeners and affiliates and sponsors for their support, the folks running the show.
[02:47:50.779 --> 02:47:58.944]  I guess I really should tell you I've written a book, 9-1-1 Dissent and the Tyranny, about September 11th and how they carried the attacks out, how the government did.
[02:47:58.984 --> 02:48:00.104]  I think it's important you have it.
[02:48:00.505 --> 02:48:01.145]  Twelve bucks.
[02:48:01.585 --> 02:48:07.869]  We've got a new book covering September 11th and other examples of terrorism and British terrorism and
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:10.921]  Just a bunch of other amazing information.
[02:48:11.062 --> 02:48:14.704]  Order out of chaos that InfoWars.com has published.
[02:48:14.784 --> 02:48:18.987]  It's 1995, over 300 pages, full of graphics and diagrams and information.
[02:48:19.427 --> 02:48:24.631]  I've got my film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, Mashes of Terror, Police State, Three Total Enslavement.
[02:48:25.992 --> 02:48:29.314]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:48:30.549 --> 02:48:32.010]  We're call toll free right now.

[02:48:34.531 --> 02:48:41.294]  What we do here, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:48:43.234 --> 02:48:45.155]  Don't count on others to expose this evil.
[02:48:45.895 --> 02:48:48.216]  And don't think resistance is futile, because it's not.
[02:48:48.557 --> 02:48:49.657]  We need you to be leaders.
[02:48:49.957 --> 02:48:51.338]  These are great tools to do it.
[02:48:51.718 --> 02:48:52.498]  Call today, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:00.882 --> 02:49:03.284]  Or InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:49:04.345 --> 02:49:11.511]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:49:12.491 --> 02:49:18.036]  Remember, all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[02:49:18.416 --> 02:49:20.017]  So don't sit there on your hind end.
[02:49:20.938 --> 02:49:22.580]  Alright, get out there and fight the New World Order.
[02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:22.980]  God bless.
[02:49:24.961 --> 02:49:27.965]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:28.285 --> 02:49:33.231]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:33.471 --> 02:49:35.754]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they aren't.
