[00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.722]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.687]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:14.733]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:19.875]  There have been bombings in Morocco, Israel, and of course Saudi Arabia.
[00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:23.516]  The boogeyman, the CIA creation, has been protected.
[00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:27.557]  Used to attack the Serbs, so they would strike back to destabilize that area.
[00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:32.679]  Used to go after the Russians, now being used against us to destabilize this country and Saudi Arabia and the world.
[00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:35.860]  So the globalists can come in and take over entire regions.
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.721]  And so it'll be a war, so you'll be patriotic while they take your pension funds, take the benefits from the veterans.
[00:00:42.398 --> 00:00:46.944]  Wholesale, destroy the economy, shut down the factories, drive down the dollar.
[00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:47.684]  It's amazing.
[00:00:47.684 --> 00:00:50.428]  And Dr. Dennis Cuddy is an author, a prolific author.
[00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:56.058]  He has several degrees and worked at a high level in the Department of Education.
[00:00:56.058 --> 00:00:57.158]  He'll tell us more about himself.
[00:00:57.158 --> 00:01:01.199]  I had him on a re-aired show I did with him a few weeks ago, Friday, when I was out of town.
[00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.820]  And I wanted to have him back on.
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.221]  We didn't have time to take the calls we wanted to last time.
[00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:10.443]  There's so much to discuss with the New World Order, and I was impressed by his understanding of it.
[00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:18.666]  Dr. Cuddy, tell us a little bit about yourself, and I want to get your take on the dropping dollar, the bombings, and this escalation of crises worldwide.
[00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.126]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.451]  Okay.
[00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:36.798]  Regarding myself, many years ago, I think I was about to be groomed to be one of the, as I call them, power elite people, because I had a sort of inquisitive mind.
[00:01:36.798 --> 00:01:41.180]  The first governor's school, as they call it in the nation, funded by Carnegie at the time,
[00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:47.570]  Uh, was set up, and they asked us, I thought, a bunch of mysterious questions.
[00:01:47.570 --> 00:02:03.295]  They gave us the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and so later on I obtained the private correspondence between the tester and what was called the Psychological Corporation of New York, and found out that they had wanted to keep tabs on us, and filed, and whatever.
[00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:09.397]  And so I began a lot of inquiries, and doors that had been opened to me suddenly started shutting.
[00:02:09.397 --> 00:02:11.418]  Nobody came out overtly and said,
[00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:17.368]  We've found out what you're up to and your persona non grata.
[00:02:17.368 --> 00:02:18.970]  They don't work like that.
[00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.193]  They just, you know, doors start closing that hadn't been opened.
[00:02:22.193 --> 00:02:29.862]  So anyway, I got into graduate school and one of the things that impressed me was the muckrakers.
[00:02:29.862 --> 00:02:32.345]  We were reading them a hundred or so years ago.
[00:02:33.175 --> 00:03:00.682]  And I remember reading in everybody's magazine back in 1904 where this really investigative reporter, not like these phony ones today, would camp outside of the headquarters of the Rockefeller building and he would notice when John D. Rockefeller walks in the dorm and this blight opens the door, but when Henry Rogers, his second in command comes in, the guy really snaps to attention because oftentimes there's sort of these behind-the-scenes people that
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.800]  I think so.
[00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:21.753]  I don't
[00:03:41.736 --> 00:03:59.574]  And so what I had done, you have to make a living at the time, I had been teaching a little bit at UNC Chapel Hill, American History, Political Science, the early courses, and then went up to the Federal Department of Education where I actually found out how this really worked in practice.
[00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:01.096]  It was like a battle every day.
[00:04:01.696 --> 00:04:04.257]  Between the bureaucrats, it was a revolving door.
[00:04:04.257 --> 00:04:08.638]  When their people were in power, they would flood into the federal agencies.
[00:04:08.638 --> 00:04:14.239]  But then when somebody of a different party comes into power, they would go back to Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller, whatever.
[00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.760]  And it was like this revolving door.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.741]  And so I had done a lot of writing, got to know a lot of people around the country, and after I left, continued this research.
[00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:24.584]  What is the New World Order?
[00:04:24.584 --> 00:04:25.284]  I mean, what's its goal?
[00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:50.218]  Well, there are different theories.
[00:04:50.218 --> 00:05:02.902]  My particular theory is that what they're using is a dialectical process over many, many years to eventually wind up with a synthesis of Eastern Communism and Western Capitalism into a world socialist government.
[00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:05.343]  What you have is our wealth is socialized.
[00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:21.378]  Put into the government pot, then it's privatized into their hands, they set up a militarized police force, they blow out the economy, then we're all employed slash through the government though, and the profits and control go to private select corporations that are not free market, but operate as organized crime syndicates.
[00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:27.764]  Eventually, they have what they would call intermediate stages.
[00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:35.872]  The intermediate stage between what you're saying and what was recently is what they would call public-private partnerships.
[00:05:35.872 --> 00:05:47.903]  They try and have these little steps in between, so it's gradualistic, moving towards this, I guess you'd call it the new feudalism of the old days, gradually a sort of techno-feudal
[00:05:48.863 --> 00:05:53.785]  Socialistic, corporate fascism of the future, but there's these little stages they go through.
[00:05:53.785 --> 00:06:01.488]  This weekend, watching the globalists say, a low dollar is good, let's drive down the value.
[00:06:01.488 --> 00:06:10.092]  I remember the day of the Switzerland Forum, almost four years ago, where they said they were going to plunge the dollar, but incrementally, so that we didn't wake up to it, it was public.
[00:06:10.092 --> 00:06:14.674]  Now they're doing it, they're telling us it's so wonderful to have a weak dollar, your response to that?
[00:06:15.735 --> 00:06:16.215]  Oh, sure.
[00:06:16.215 --> 00:06:31.910]  I mean, this is the same principle that JFK used when we had about 60 or so percent of the world's gold supply in the early 60s, and he was very proud that he said he just practically gave away 20 percent, lowering us down to 40 percent of the world's gold supply, because that would
[00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.893]  That's not what was really happening.
[00:06:35.893 --> 00:06:44.680]  The locals own the third world countries and were transferring it themselves.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:52.626]  I remember telling you what happened to Colonel House's daughter when she sort of spilled the beans on that later.
[00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:54.628]  But it's always presented as such.
[00:06:54.628 --> 00:06:57.590]  And then what you have is what you also indicated, a crisis.
[00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.492]  Well, it must have been another show, Dr. Cuddy, because
[00:07:23.832 --> 00:07:26.454]  Tell us about, I know about House's daughter, but we didn't discuss that.
[00:07:26.454 --> 00:07:31.538]  Tell us about Mandel House, and tell us about that, the CFR structure, and tell us what happened to his daughter.
[00:07:32.688 --> 00:07:39.533]  Well, Edwin Mandelhouse had gone to school in Texas in the middle 1800s.
[00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:45.598]  His father was practically the only one who came out making a lot of money out of the Civil War.
[00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:49.061]  And he was fairly well-connected.
[00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:51.202]  He went over to England to school.
[00:07:51.202 --> 00:07:52.503]  British agent?
[00:07:52.503 --> 00:07:53.724]  Well, yeah.
[00:07:53.724 --> 00:07:54.705]  And his father.
[00:07:54.705 --> 00:07:56.026]  Both were British agents.
[00:07:56.565 --> 00:08:08.453]  And then, when he came back, he was very agile at getting together with very key people through others, Bernard Baruch and others, which set him up with Woodrow Wilson.
[00:08:08.453 --> 00:08:11.615]  He became his chief advisor, to make a long story short.
[00:08:11.615 --> 00:08:17.038]  In 1912, he wrote a book, Philip Drew Administrator, which was under a pseudonym.
[00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:20.020]  But he, in there, said it was Karl Marx's socialism.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.382]  Socialism was dreamed of by Karl Marx, that he wanted.
[00:08:23.007 --> 00:08:23.087]  Yes.
[00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:57.222]  Where House, and I put this in my book, The Globalist, where House, literally in his diary, is writing that he's lied to Orlando, Clemenceau, the leaders of Europe, toward the end of the Second World War, telling them that you can't do anything about these Bolsheviks and their revolution.
[00:08:57.222 --> 00:09:03.348]  And then House writes in his diary, he says, of course, I really knew that we could have, one division could have put it all down.
[00:09:03.348 --> 00:09:04.709]  The point is, here's one man,
[00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:15.476]  Who allowed the Bolshevik Revolution to spread when it could have been stopped, and therefore, had he not done that, you may not have had a Second World War, a Vietnam, Korea, whatever.
[00:09:15.476 --> 00:09:16.997]  He changed the entire course of history.
[00:09:16.997 --> 00:09:24.581]  A few years later, of course, he's very close to FDR, and FDR writes him saying to Colonel House, I've just talked to Jack Morgan, that's J.P.
[00:09:24.581 --> 00:09:27.843]  Morgan's son, Jack Morgan, who is very instrumental in setting up the CFR.
[00:09:28.715 --> 00:09:32.678]  Part of House's inquiry group after the Second World War.
[00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:42.585]  And he says to House, he says, the real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that the financial element in the larger centers has owned our government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.
[00:09:42.585 --> 00:09:45.507]  They speak very freely among themselves to this extent.
[00:09:45.507 --> 00:09:46.568]  Of course, he has a daughter.
[00:09:46.568 --> 00:09:48.449]  Later on, she's hooked up with the Rockefellers.
[00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:58.353]  And she says, according to reports, that they had been siphoning off the pure gold from Fort Knox, so that what you have there is now sort of a copper gold.
[00:09:58.353 --> 00:10:11.077]  And right after she led on that what they had done is gotten their European agents to buy up this gold, but really to keep control of it, she, quote, accidentally fell out of a six-story window of a building.
[00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:13.658]  That's the way the story goes.
[00:10:13.658 --> 00:10:16.159]  And I've got the newspaper articles on that.
[00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:23.722]  The globalists are now public about their new world order, but oh, we've got to have it to keep us safe from terrorists.
[00:10:23.722 --> 00:10:30.205]  It's like, oh, we've got to have League of Nations to stop another World War I. We've got to have a UN to stop another World War II.
[00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:35.047]  For those that get confused between communism and fascism, it's all command and control, different flavors of it.
[00:10:35.047 --> 00:10:41.751]  The bankers created hit teams of revolutionaries they funded to bring down existing governments, good or bad,
[00:10:42.782 --> 00:10:55.167]  As puppets, and then always funded and controlled them, and they had a new type of neo-feudalism or serfdom that they quote, put a window dressing on for the people using class envy to target the middle class.
[00:10:55.167 --> 00:11:02.050]  Is that an accurate summation of why the bankers, the richest people in the world, fund communism?
[00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.312]  Uh, yeah, with one little additional... Sorry, I think your phone may have just got a problem.
[00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:07.672]  Can you speak up?
[00:11:07.672 --> 00:11:08.713]  Uh, yeah, can you hear me?
[00:11:09.381 --> 00:11:09.841]  I don't know.
[00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:11.282]  I'm not sure what just happened.
[00:11:11.282 --> 00:11:12.683]  We'll try to fix it during the break.
[00:11:12.683 --> 00:11:17.026]  I think your phone may have been partially unplugged or something.
[00:11:17.026 --> 00:11:18.307]  Perhaps I'm losing audio.
[00:11:18.307 --> 00:11:18.887]  I'm not sure.
[00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:24.511]  I tell you what, Dr. Cuddy, we'll fix it during the break.
[00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:25.652]  Stay right there, okay?
[00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:26.672]  Okay.
[00:11:26.672 --> 00:11:27.513]  Oh, you're a little bit better now.
[00:11:28.457 --> 00:11:32.818]  When we get back, we'll discuss that and real political paradigms, how to break that cookie-cutter mold.
[00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:34.559]  And then I want to take calls.
[00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:37.179]  We've got John in Louisiana and others.
[00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:39.420]  Toll-free number to talk to, Dr. Dennis Cuddy, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:39.980]  800-259-9231.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.101]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:43.501]  So stay with me.
[00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:47.302]  And we have just updated InfoWars.com, if you want to visit it.
[00:11:55.685 --> 00:11:58.231]  See all the news articles we've posted if you want to be truly informed.
[00:12:10.117 --> 00:12:16.942]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk Archives, and we are listener-supported with the honors system.
[00:12:16.942 --> 00:12:18.584]  We ask that you wait.
[00:12:18.584 --> 00:12:20.465]  Don't donate a dollar at a time.
[00:12:20.465 --> 00:12:26.049]  PayPal charges a 35-cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[00:12:26.049 --> 00:12:29.572]  Wait till you listen to five or ten, and then donate, please.
[00:12:29.572 --> 00:12:31.854]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[00:12:40.803 --> 00:12:42.865]  The documentation begins, my friend.
[00:12:42.865 --> 00:12:43.705]  The rumor's in.
[00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:50.150]  The globalists are out in the open, destroying America, setting up a high-tech police state.
[00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.691]  Are you going to put up with it?
[00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:54.172]  Dr. Cuddy is our guest.
[00:12:54.172 --> 00:12:55.173]  I know we have a lot of callers.
[00:12:55.173 --> 00:12:57.535]  We'll get to you in the next segment.
[00:12:57.535 --> 00:12:58.395]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:58.395 --> 00:13:04.619]  You were making some points, doctor, as we hit that last break.
[00:13:04.619 --> 00:13:05.400]  Please continue.
[00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:12.425]  Just following up with what you had said and I wanted to add one additional point.
[00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.666]  The public thinks confused when
[00:13:15.507 --> 00:13:31.765]  One talks about the bankers and the communists, but if the theory is that world socialist government is the goal, what you've got to remember is the bankers and transnational corporate heads and so forth actually love socialism if they can control the politicians.
[00:13:31.765 --> 00:13:36.831]  They donate money to get their particular political candidates into office, and then those candidates
[00:13:37.364 --> 00:13:46.429]  Now the members of Congress or whatever enact rules and regulations that prevent competition to those multinational corporations or banking regulators.
[00:13:46.429 --> 00:13:56.195]  Yeah, it's crony capitalism with an army of thugs, whether you call them fascists or communists, they wear black uniforms, they have snatch and grab operations, there's giant prisons, total surveillance.
[00:13:56.195 --> 00:13:57.555]  It's the same system.
[00:13:57.555 --> 00:14:05.340]  It's a global web controlled by private central banks and then all the profits off of communism, the socialism, the fascism are funneled to them.
[00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:16.367]  Yeah, the private central banks and the what are called international investment bankers, the Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, those two.
[00:14:16.367 --> 00:14:26.837]  I know there's a lot of different facets and points to cover, and what areas do you think we should get into to try to explain the New World Order to people and to try to go over it and talk about the chinks in its armor?
[00:14:26.837 --> 00:14:28.318]  I want to talk about some solutions.
[00:14:32.025 --> 00:14:33.667]  It's multifaceted.
[00:14:33.667 --> 00:14:41.572]  I'll move through two or three examples, and you just cut me off when the break comes.
[00:14:41.572 --> 00:14:43.494]  They have to control everything.
[00:14:43.494 --> 00:14:45.175]  Dr. Cuddy, I'll ask you again.
[00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:46.536]  Are you on a headset?
[00:14:46.536 --> 00:14:47.697]  Nope.
[00:14:47.697 --> 00:14:51.360]  Is there any way you can get closer to your receiver?
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.901]  No, I'm right in it.
[00:14:52.901 --> 00:14:53.701]  Okay.
[00:14:53.701 --> 00:14:54.382]  Alright, go ahead.
[00:14:55.579 --> 00:14:58.242]  Uh, they want to control everything.
[00:14:58.242 --> 00:15:08.711]  And so the foundations, let's say the Rockefeller Foundation, they set up a policy years ago, 1933, to have social control of everybody.
[00:15:08.711 --> 00:15:12.454]  How that works is they would fund through Tavistock, let's say in 1945,
[00:15:14.252 --> 00:15:14.612]  Okay.
[00:15:39.332 --> 00:15:46.036]  In the state of Wisconsin, in the early 60s, standing outside a college lunch line.
[00:15:46.036 --> 00:15:47.057]  What's he doing there?
[00:15:47.057 --> 00:15:50.238]  He's not got any business there, but there he is.
[00:15:50.238 --> 00:15:54.561]  Along the hall comes a Wayne Peterson, who most of you listeners probably haven't heard of.
[00:15:55.367 --> 00:16:06.976]  David says, uh, come on over here, and gets joined, uh, Wayne to join the Peace Corps, has him sent down to, uh, Brazil, where he, in effect, constructs their social welfare state.
[00:16:06.976 --> 00:16:10.599]  By the time he gets back, Wayne walks in his, uh, living room.
[00:16:10.599 --> 00:16:16.203]  Lo and behold, there's Melvin Laird in his living room, Secretary of Defense under, uh, Nixon.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.841]  He says, Laird says, well, we've got to get you a government position.
[00:16:19.841 --> 00:16:33.887]  He winds up putting Wayne, more or less, in charge of the Fulbright scholarship programs, and by the early 80s, Wayne is running around the country promoting Lord Matreya, who is supposed to be the second coming of Christ.
[00:16:33.887 --> 00:16:39.229]  This is a facilitation of key individuals and key positions.
[00:16:39.229 --> 00:16:43.610]  One last example, let's take the Rhodes Scholars, which is part of Cecil Rhodes' plan.
[00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.591]  I'll just give you one example of how this works.
[00:16:47.162 --> 00:16:55.226]  You downgrade the CIA's capabilities under Stansfield Turner during Carter's years, Jimmy Carter's years.
[00:16:55.226 --> 00:16:58.628]  Stansfield is a Rhodes Scholar, CIA hit.
[00:16:58.628 --> 00:17:06.453]  Moving to Clinton, you have Rhodes Scholar roommates, Scope Talbot saying perhaps national sovereignty is not such a great idea after all.
[00:17:06.453 --> 00:17:11.976]  The President Clinton, his Rhodes Scholar roommate, makes him second in line in the State Department.
[00:17:13.002 --> 00:17:18.210]  Uh, Strobe gets an award from the World Federalist, uh, who won World Federal Government.
[00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:25.900]  Clinton writes a letter saying, this is great, uh, you, the WFA, you've worked for, your president has worked for World Government.
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.244]  He wishes him best wishes for future success.
[00:17:28.982 --> 00:17:33.787]  He then appoints Richard Gardner as Secretary, I mean Ambassador to Spain.
[00:17:33.787 --> 00:17:42.075]  Gardner's the one, Rhodes Scholar again, who wrote The Hard Road to World Order saying, erode national sovereignty piece by piece.
[00:17:42.075 --> 00:17:52.786]  From Spain, they all get together, Clinton, Strobe, Gardner, and select Javier Solana to be the new, he's a former Marxist now, new political head of NATO.
[00:17:53.626 --> 00:17:57.747]  Uh, the military head of NATO is Wesley Clark, another Rhodes Scholar.
[00:17:57.747 --> 00:18:08.789]  Uh, Wesley Clark, under him, his two commanders at Fort Hood, uh, they prepared the plan for the assault at Waco against the Branch Davidians, had a mock-up of there.
[00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:13.870]  So it's all part of social control, having their millions everywhere, all members of the same organization.
[00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.070]  Stay there, we'll come back and finish up with this.
[00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.211]  Start going to calls and get into many other facets in our study of the New World Order.
[00:18:21.222 --> 00:18:25.125]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:27.847]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:48.996]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:18:56.855 --> 00:18:57.856]  All right, folks.
[00:18:57.856 --> 00:19:00.637]  We're about halfway into the broadcast today.
[00:19:00.637 --> 00:19:07.660]  We have Dr. Dennis Cuddy, written a whole bunch of powerful books exposing the New World Order, all from what is provable.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:16.865]  What we can document, there's a lot of quacks and kooks out there that on the other side putting out this info, but this information is very, very accurate, and we put out accurate information here as well.
[00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:25.989]  Before we go back to our guest and then to John and Umar and Ted and Kenny and many, many others, before we do that,
[00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:33.861]  I want to remind the listeners that I have produced nine documentary films, full-length feature documentary films.
[00:19:33.861 --> 00:19:35.882]  They are waking people up.
[00:19:35.882 --> 00:19:40.264]  We're seeing 90% conversion rates for the folks that see the videos.
[00:19:40.264 --> 00:19:46.867]  90% of people that see them have tears in their eyes, wake up, because they've already seen so much of what we're covering.
[00:19:46.867 --> 00:19:48.548]  They already knew about most of it.
[00:19:48.548 --> 00:19:50.989]  Now it's all been put down for them to see the master plan.
[00:19:51.903 --> 00:19:53.785]  My new film is out.
[00:19:53.785 --> 00:19:55.588]  It's two hours, 37 minutes long.
[00:19:55.588 --> 00:19:57.510]  It's only three films in one.
[00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.993]  I suggest you watch it in three 50-minute pieces.
[00:19:59.993 --> 00:20:05.019]  Don't watch it all at one time, so you can absorb all of it.
[00:20:06.532 --> 00:20:13.877]  It is $25.95, and if you order three or more of any of my nine videos, they drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:20:13.877 --> 00:20:19.902]  It's an $18 discount on the three-tape special, and it gets bigger, obviously, as you order additional copies.
[00:20:19.902 --> 00:20:22.484]  I've written my first book, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny, 230 pages, $12.
[00:20:24.685 --> 00:20:26.727]  Covers the globalist plan for domination as well.
[00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:28.128]  Gets into 9-1-1.
[00:20:28.128 --> 00:20:29.229]  Road to Tyranny does that.
[00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:30.470]  The video.
[00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.371]  I have dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:20:32.371 --> 00:20:35.674]  The occult activities of world leaders caught on video.
[00:20:35.674 --> 00:20:37.235]  This stuff is true!
[00:20:37.235 --> 00:20:39.637]  And they say truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:20:39.637 --> 00:20:40.038]  It is!
[00:20:40.931 --> 00:20:44.392]  And your purchase of the videos or the books supports the broadcast.
[00:20:44.392 --> 00:20:50.713]  Please make the call or order online or write to me today and get the videos and make copies.
[00:20:50.713 --> 00:21:01.095]  I'm one of the few people that authorizes you for non-profit educational purposes to make copies of my films and spread the word because that's how we force multiply the information.
[00:21:01.095 --> 00:21:06.696]  The total free number to order my videos or books or my t-shirts or the other titles and authors that we carry
[00:21:07.416 --> 00:21:07.556]  Is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:21:07.556 --> 00:21:15.163]  Again, that toll free number to order is 1-888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com to order or PresentPlanet.com on our secure online shopping carts.
[00:21:15.163 --> 00:21:16.964]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001
[00:21:34.484 --> 00:21:44.646]  That's 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:21:44.646 --> 00:21:47.706]  Don't wait, take action today.
[00:21:47.706 --> 00:21:52.867]  Dr. Cuddy, I got one more question for you, then I want to go to these loaded phones here.
[00:21:52.867 --> 00:21:54.668]  All these callers.
[00:21:54.668 --> 00:21:58.768]  And then we can continue discussing other facets of the New World Order.
[00:21:58.768 --> 00:22:01.749]  Because I respect your opinion and your deep research on this subject.
[00:22:03.968 --> 00:22:05.871]  The New World Order power structure.
[00:22:05.871 --> 00:22:07.754]  We know there's a handful of families.
[00:22:07.754 --> 00:22:12.301]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch, the British Roll families, the Warburgs, the Crumps.
[00:22:12.301 --> 00:22:16.828]  We know who owns the stock in the big private central banks that print the money and buy up the world with it.
[00:22:17.563 --> 00:22:18.423]  We understand that.
[00:22:18.423 --> 00:22:21.245]  We know they have the Bilderberg Group for Northern and Western Europe.
[00:22:21.245 --> 00:22:25.186]  We know they have the Trilateral Commission that's more economist here.
[00:22:25.186 --> 00:22:45.275]  We know they have the CFR, kind of a house of commons for the globalist, low-level, with thousands of members in academia and banking and media and government, coming together, bringing us this new world order, writing the policies, all being enriched by the system, a society, a colony organism of criminals.
[00:22:47.108 --> 00:23:02.191]  And we know that these mechanisms work together and at the highest levels of the CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, Committee of 300, you have the top people chairing all these groups and on the IMF, the World Bank, WTO, UN, Ex-Im Bank, OECD.
[00:23:02.191 --> 00:23:04.271]  It's all the same group, all the same people.
[00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:06.991]  Can we talk some about the mechanism of control?
[00:23:06.991 --> 00:23:16.353]  We know how they recruit with Rhodes Scholars and others to get the minions to fill the shoes later, the psychological studies they do of college students, high school students, to pick the people they're going to have.
[00:23:16.986 --> 00:23:18.067]  We understand this system.
[00:23:18.067 --> 00:23:19.608]  We know how they use terror to scare us.
[00:23:19.608 --> 00:23:21.229]  We accept this.
[00:23:21.229 --> 00:23:27.693]  More about the structure, the command and control system, and some of the solutions, then I want to go to the calls.
[00:23:27.693 --> 00:23:35.898]  Well, through a series of... I guess Stalin and Lenin talked about disunion for the purpose of union.
[00:23:35.898 --> 00:23:39.120]  You have to break down patriotism.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:45.924]  Back in 1798, Philip Frenot wrote, at that time, a sort of warning to the American revolutionary
[00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:53.153]  People of how the power elite would eventually come about destroying us, taking us over.
[00:23:53.153 --> 00:23:58.416]  And what you have is you create crises, a war, let's say, during the 70s.
[00:23:58.416 --> 00:24:02.558]  You poll 20 to 29-year-olds.
[00:24:02.558 --> 00:24:08.141]  You find out during the Vietnam period that patriotism is only important to about 25% of them.
[00:24:08.141 --> 00:24:12.883]  This sends a signal that since patriotism is that important,
[00:24:13.403 --> 00:24:14.025]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:24:23.718 --> 00:24:28.501]  To get a world government, you have a world economy, and you do that by regional economic arrangements.
[00:24:28.501 --> 00:24:35.927]  The interim step, they always move in these little interim steps, like Zbigniew Brzezinski said, we'll get to a world government, but we'll do it by regions first.
[00:24:35.927 --> 00:24:38.529]  And before that, Cecil Rhodes, his fellow P.E.
[00:24:38.529 --> 00:24:40.771]  Corbett, mapped out that plan.
[00:24:40.771 --> 00:24:45.295]  You have these structures because there's a lot of egos out there.
[00:24:45.295 --> 00:24:52.521]  And so at the top, you'll have the Bilderbergs, as you said, the trilaterals, meaning Japan, Europe, and the U.S., the top leaders.
[00:24:54.403 --> 00:25:04.211]  They function through key entities such as the Bank for International Settlements, which is like the bank over all the central banks of the world.
[00:25:05.081 --> 00:25:14.148]  And they will set up certain policies which will increase, decrease rates of interest, investment opportunities.
[00:25:14.148 --> 00:25:17.371]  Then the power structure moves through laws.
[00:25:17.371 --> 00:25:25.578]  For example, in 1980, you had the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which allowed companies and transnational corporations to actually buy others.
[00:25:25.578 --> 00:25:28.380]  For example, Deutsche Bank in Germany now owns a lot.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.901]  I mean, a lot of U.S.
[00:25:30.901 --> 00:25:39.866]  companies and corporations, even though most people don't even know it, agricultural ventures have been bought up by foreign corporations as well.
[00:25:39.866 --> 00:25:50.831]  So, you have the economic control, but still, you've got a lot of these mid-level hotshots that you have to assuage them and stroke them, make them feel real important.
[00:25:50.831 --> 00:25:56.694]  And so, through things like the World Economic Forum, you allow them to have their input
[00:25:57.565 --> 00:26:04.347]  You have the UN doing the same thing with its NGOs and INGOs, International Non-Governmental Organizations.
[00:26:04.347 --> 00:26:17.770]  You use them, the power structure, as a lobbying mechanism within the various countries to change the laws to accept things like the, you know, World Heritage Sites and various land control entities.
[00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:24.892]  You know, it's the same way the Feds send in change agents to go to a city council or school board meeting where people are fighting and changing things.
[00:26:24.892 --> 00:26:25.112]  They go,
[00:26:25.712 --> 00:26:27.314]  Oh, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:26:27.314 --> 00:26:28.815]  Okay, we heard what you want.
[00:26:28.815 --> 00:26:29.536]  We're going to do it.
[00:26:29.536 --> 00:26:33.619]  Here's what you said, and it's really what the globalists wanted to begin with.
[00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:34.120]  That's right.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.985]  They used facilitators through various Delphi techniques to do this, and Edward Bernays
[00:26:40.856 --> 00:27:02.122]  He was hired by William Paley in 1928 as his chief advisor with CBS, wrote a book called Propaganda, and in that book he said, we're like an invisible government, we know how to manipulate you, and at the end he says, sort of like Ross Perot, he says, we need a businessman politician type to say, I must lead the people, am I not their servant?
[00:27:02.122 --> 00:27:08.884]  You know, here's what you say you want, and it's really facilitated.
[00:27:08.884 --> 00:27:09.344]  Please continue.
[00:27:10.976 --> 00:27:21.502]  Okay, well, the mechanism then has an upper tier, a middle tier, it has devices for political change, economic change, we've been through that.
[00:27:21.502 --> 00:27:28.125]  The political change is hooked up with the social change, and once again, since you're in Texas, I'll use the Texas example.
[00:27:28.977 --> 00:27:32.299]  You have the Industrial Areas Foundation.
[00:27:32.299 --> 00:27:34.380]  Ernesto Cortez is down there.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.241]  He took over from Saul Alinsky, who wrote a book called Rules for Radicals.
[00:27:38.241 --> 00:27:43.424]  And in the first of it, he says that we have an acknowledgment to Lucifer, and he really liked him.
[00:27:43.424 --> 00:27:45.685]  And Hillary Clinton just loved Alinsky.
[00:27:45.685 --> 00:27:50.067]  She wrote her senior thesis at Wellesley about Alinsky.
[00:27:50.067 --> 00:27:54.029]  And Alinsky says what you do is you rub raw the resentments in the community.
[00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:56.430]  You foster this sort of class welfare.
[00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:05.174]  I never supposed liberals controlled by the neocons bringing in the illegals, creating liberation theology, breeding that revolution.
[00:28:05.174 --> 00:28:12.078]  In religion, right, and in terms of land, you do it through the Reconquista movement coming up through Texas and into California and so on, yes.
[00:28:12.498 --> 00:28:14.820]  And tell them what La Rican Quista is.
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.821]  That basically means re-conquering.
[00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:32.792]  They believe that actually the entire Southwest, from California to New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, is owned by Mexico, but it's Washington and New York financing that part of regionalism to then break the country up.
[00:28:32.792 --> 00:28:33.233]  That's right.
[00:28:33.233 --> 00:28:38.997]  You break down the borders, and then you unite them, various mechanisms to stop terrorism.
[00:28:38.997 --> 00:28:40.538]  We have to have exchanges.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:49.665]  No, university consortiums allowing degrees to be transferred from south of the border to... They have these bicongresses now between Mexico, the U.S.
[00:28:49.665 --> 00:28:51.266]  and Canada with all the leaders together.
[00:28:51.266 --> 00:28:53.728]  Yeah, and military coordination, yeah.
[00:28:55.032 --> 00:28:55.352]  I don't
[00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:28.619]  You give a little tidbit to tomato growers in Florida to just get enough, and then what you do is you fund, you say, well, look at all these exports, but they don't tell you really the exports are not finished products.
[00:29:28.619 --> 00:29:38.367]  They go to these factories just south of the border where, in effect, Mexico becomes a 51st state where you don't have to have labor and health and so forth regulations.
[00:29:38.367 --> 00:29:42.531]  Then the transnationals funnel those goods, those finished products, back into the U.S.
[00:29:43.675 --> 00:29:46.159]  And people say, oh, that's just to make money competition.
[00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:48.303]  No, they control the board game.
[00:29:48.303 --> 00:29:55.696]  This is to lower our standard of living, to get us degradated because the middle class is independent, but a massive poor class isn't.
[00:29:55.696 --> 00:29:56.958]  Then you have massive
[00:29:58.462 --> 00:30:11.378]  Social class envy, they don't have the left wing to control that, to focus it at the remaining middle class, then the underclass is liberalized, they pass gun control, they pass thought crime legislation, it's the total takeover.
[00:30:11.378 --> 00:30:15.423]  Yeah, it's a total mechanism of controlling, they have to control everything.
[00:30:16.664 --> 00:30:29.131]  Like Barry Goldwater said, for example, the trilateral, in his book, With No Apologies, he says there's not only political, social, and economic control, they want ecclesiastical control as well, because they know values is very important.
[00:30:29.131 --> 00:30:33.074]  And I want to talk about the World Council of Churches and all these neocons and the rest of it, but...
[00:30:34.392 --> 00:30:35.553]  We've got a bunch of callers.
[00:30:35.553 --> 00:30:37.295]  I want time to talk about solutions.
[00:30:37.295 --> 00:30:40.278]  I want time to talk about your books and other information.
[00:30:40.278 --> 00:30:46.064]  We got cut short last time, and I did give the number out after you'd already left us for your books again, but we'll do that.
[00:30:46.064 --> 00:30:48.146]  I'm not sure how long we have with you.
[00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:49.487]  How long can you stay with us, Dr. Cutty?
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.901]  Well, let's finish this hour and see how my throat's going.
[00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:56.403]  I had some throat surgery some time ago, but we'll see.
[00:30:56.403 --> 00:30:56.863]  Great.
[00:30:56.863 --> 00:30:59.905]  I hope to keep you at least halfway to the next hour.
[00:30:59.905 --> 00:31:04.287]  Real quick, some solutions right now to this fight.
[00:31:04.287 --> 00:31:05.648]  How do we resist this thing?
[00:31:05.648 --> 00:31:07.369]  Is it bottom line education?
[00:31:07.369 --> 00:31:10.050]  People have to know there's this enemy destroying their freedoms first?
[00:31:11.842 --> 00:31:13.923]  Yeah, and it's going to be hard.
[00:31:13.923 --> 00:31:18.045]  Unfortunately, Americans have been conditioned to want quick fixes.
[00:31:18.045 --> 00:31:27.048]  You know, the sort of half-hour TV show where the villains are conquered and everything becomes okay and you go back to eating your pizza and burgers and stuff.
[00:31:27.048 --> 00:31:33.771]  But that's not going to work because it's not just that they are doing a particular thing to us.
[00:31:33.771 --> 00:31:35.512]  They actually control the process.
[00:31:35.512 --> 00:31:40.374]  If they were just, you know, if there was just say one superintendent in a particular town in Texas that was
[00:31:41.094 --> 00:31:41.775]  I think so.
[00:31:56.224 --> 00:32:01.726]  Yeah, so the only way I see it is a really determined grassroots movement that is here to stay.
[00:32:01.726 --> 00:32:11.650]  Not a 5,000 person rally in Austin or something, but a movement that's here to stay through letters to the editor, listening to talk shows like yours, communicating, building slowly.
[00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:21.654]  It's going to take time that you organize an opposition that they know isn't going to go away and that is going to affect their re-election or re-appointment to some sort of local board.
[00:32:24.452 --> 00:32:25.213]  We're good to go.
[00:32:42.569 --> 00:32:49.572]  Look, 99 plus percent of the police, medical workers refused the smallpox shot.
[00:32:49.572 --> 00:32:51.073]  That's a major victory right there.
[00:32:51.073 --> 00:32:55.415]  Now the Globalists can't watch that attack for the total lockdown.
[00:32:55.415 --> 00:32:56.415]  We're having a lot of victories.
[00:32:56.415 --> 00:33:00.837]  I talked to police over the weekend who were at the event, and of course Colonel Roberts is a police officer.
[00:33:00.837 --> 00:33:03.098]  He says he goes to meet the police now.
[00:33:03.098 --> 00:33:07.420]  He says about half of them know about the New World Order and aren't going along with it.
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.862]  So I see a massive wake-up happening.
[00:33:09.862 --> 00:33:10.702]  It's just very quiet.
[00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.911]  Yeah, I would offer one cautionary note.
[00:33:14.911 --> 00:33:21.232]  The New World Order crowd is always pretty good at anticipating what we're going to do.
[00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:33.034]  And so what they try to do is demonize us by, if we come along, let's say, like the student movement in the 60s.
[00:33:33.034 --> 00:33:35.835]  They come in and they say, well, here are our 20 demands or whatever it is.
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:47.327]  And what the New World Order crowd will do is, if we say there are these 20 things wrong, they'll try and pick our weakest link and then demonize us and marginalize us.
[00:33:47.327 --> 00:33:51.310]  So what I would advocate is in a, let's say, a small town in Texas or whatever,
[00:33:52.182 --> 00:33:59.146]  You would pick your one basic issue that you think there's a lot of public support for and that you can win on, and then you do that.
[00:33:59.146 --> 00:34:05.649]  Once you've done that, you've gained credibility, it'll be hard for the press to say, these are a bunch of right-wing wackos, and then you move forward.
[00:34:05.649 --> 00:34:18.196]  Rather than say, alright, here are our 20 issues, our 20 demands, you might start with just one first to get credibility so that they can't be... Well, I've told listeners, pick a movement, you know, the fight for property rights, the fight for the Second Amendment is so key.
[00:34:18.196 --> 00:34:18.636]  That's right.
[00:34:19.156 --> 00:34:19.577]  That's right.
[00:34:19.577 --> 00:34:20.378]  That's exactly right.
[00:34:34.398 --> 00:34:37.080]  All right, let's go to some calls and we'll talk more about solutions.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.902]  John, Louisiana, then Umar, Ted, Kenny and others.
[00:34:40.902 --> 00:34:41.803]  John, you're on the air.
[00:34:41.803 --> 00:34:42.483]  Welcome.
[00:34:42.483 --> 00:34:45.205]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex and Dr. Cuddy.
[00:34:45.205 --> 00:34:50.448]  It might be worthwhile to mention that old poor old Woodrow Wilson got wise to house
[00:34:50.868 --> 00:34:52.490]  Yeah, yeah, great damage had been done by then.
[00:35:08.471 --> 00:35:16.993]  And then he moved, as I understand it and remember, he moved into the White House and lived in the White House, and so he worked on all FDR night and day.
[00:35:16.993 --> 00:35:31.538]  I wanted to talk about the absurdity of a declining dollar, but first, Skolnik is reported by Joe Skousen as saying that Saddam Hussein has been moved and is located now in the side of the United States.
[00:35:31.538 --> 00:35:34.178]  Others report that Europe has said that he's in Russia.
[00:35:34.178 --> 00:35:36.159]  It's a fact that he's in one or the other.
[00:35:36.819 --> 00:35:40.962]  John, the evidence shows that he was probably taken out to Russia.
[00:35:40.962 --> 00:35:43.083]  They probably gave him the amnesty deal in the middle of the fight.
[00:35:43.083 --> 00:35:48.687]  They could still try a double though, so look out here in this running man system.
[00:35:48.687 --> 00:35:55.552]  But you need to understand that what we need to do is stick to things we can absolutely prove.
[00:35:55.552 --> 00:35:55.972]  Dr. Cutty?
[00:35:57.386 --> 00:36:04.491]  Yeah, it could be that he was taken out to Belarus or one of these other pre-arranged early on.
[00:36:04.491 --> 00:36:09.135]  But like Alex said, it's not that that's not important.
[00:36:09.135 --> 00:36:10.575]  It is important.
[00:36:10.575 --> 00:36:14.758]  But you have to watch for some distractions.
[00:36:14.758 --> 00:36:19.722]  Originally, you have Osama bin Laden, all focused on him.
[00:36:19.722 --> 00:36:21.943]  Then things aren't going so well, then you switch to Saddam.
[00:36:23.144 --> 00:36:23.665]  Stay there.
[00:36:23.665 --> 00:36:24.686]  Everybody stay there.
[00:36:24.686 --> 00:36:25.688]  Good point though, John.
[00:36:25.688 --> 00:36:27.190]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[00:36:55.339 --> 00:36:57.721]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:36:57.721 --> 00:37:02.025]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:37:02.025 --> 00:37:05.227]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:37:05.227 --> 00:37:09.671]  Dr. Cuddy, John had wanted you to speak about the dollar, a little bit more about that.
[00:37:09.671 --> 00:37:14.775]  I mean, to say that it's good for our economy, especially when we've been so de-industrialized.
[00:37:14.775 --> 00:37:16.416]  Everybody knew it was a strong dollar.
[00:37:16.416 --> 00:37:19.479]  It was fiat, but we could still buy a lot of stuff with it.
[00:37:19.479 --> 00:37:21.100]  What does this do, driving down the dollar?
[00:37:22.652 --> 00:37:27.115]  Well, the globalists don't give a diddly about what happens here.
[00:37:27.115 --> 00:37:28.916]  It's like you said, a leveling process.
[00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:38.382]  So if you drive down the dollar, then it becomes better, supposedly, for foreign investors to put their money in here.
[00:37:38.382 --> 00:37:41.724]  But our buying power is less.
[00:37:41.724 --> 00:37:48.748]  And so what you do is, in furtherance of the global economy, you sacrifice the Americans' wages.
[00:37:48.748 --> 00:37:49.369]  Absolutely.
[00:37:50.583 --> 00:37:51.764]  Let's take some more calls.
[00:37:51.764 --> 00:37:52.625]  Umar in Michigan.
[00:37:52.625 --> 00:37:53.205]  You're on the air.
[00:37:53.205 --> 00:37:54.827]  Thanks for holding.
[00:37:54.827 --> 00:37:55.307]  Uh, yeah.
[00:37:55.307 --> 00:37:57.269]  How you doing today, gentlemen?
[00:37:57.269 --> 00:37:58.490]  Good.
[00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:06.017]  Uh, like, Alex, one of your films was placed out in, uh, Camp Michigan at a pretty big store.
[00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:13.024]  It was given to two people, and all of a sudden, everybody that worked in the store wanted it.
[00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:14.085]  Uh, Dr. Cuddy?
[00:38:14.085 --> 00:38:14.765]  Yes, sir?
[00:38:14.765 --> 00:38:16.347]  Like, you're familiar with these
[00:38:17.324 --> 00:38:24.167]  Gigantic mutated cockroaches that's trying to kill 95% of the population.
[00:38:24.167 --> 00:38:36.192]  It's all kind of... I don't know whether you would call it proof or evidence or whatever, that they were involved, trained and funded Al Qaeda.
[00:38:36.192 --> 00:38:40.234]  What kind of way can we immediately bring them to justice?
[00:38:40.234 --> 00:38:45.016]  Because I grew up in... Yes, how do we bring the gigantic mutated cockroaches to justice, doctor?
[00:38:46.318 --> 00:38:51.984]  Uh, well, what kind of justice specifically?
[00:38:51.984 --> 00:38:55.447]  That's really mean to talk bad about cockroaches.
[00:38:55.447 --> 00:38:56.889]  God designed them, they have a job.
[00:39:03.177 --> 00:39:05.681]  Well, I mean, he talked about the educational process.
[00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:06.602]  People have to know.
[00:39:06.602 --> 00:39:12.070]  See, the globalists will ruin our economy and then tell us it's some other reason and impose as our saviors.
[00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:16.577]  Doctor, aren't they very good at creating the crisis and imposing as our savior throughout the crises?
[00:39:17.738 --> 00:39:23.921]  Oh yeah, that the crisis is created to facilitate the solution that they had all along.
[00:39:23.921 --> 00:39:33.525]  Well, we've been through it a number of times, whether it's school shootings, economic, school education, you know, that sort of thing.
[00:39:33.525 --> 00:39:39.147]  That's not going to make me give up my goods because of some school shootings when I know it's them that's behind it.
[00:39:39.147 --> 00:39:41.268]  Like we say, if this guy, what's his name?
[00:39:42.529 --> 00:39:45.091]  This psychologist that works for the CIA.
[00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:46.853]  I forgot his name.
[00:39:46.853 --> 00:39:47.493]  I got it wrote down.
[00:39:47.493 --> 00:39:48.434]  Jolion West was the guy.
[00:39:48.434 --> 00:39:49.455]  Yeah, Jolion West.
[00:39:49.455 --> 00:39:50.356]  That's him.
[00:39:50.356 --> 00:39:52.678]  He shows up at all the shootings.
[00:39:52.678 --> 00:39:53.899]  And you got Malvo.
[00:39:53.899 --> 00:39:57.662]  You got Malvo, one of the snipers, obviously on drugs, hopped up every time we see him.
[00:39:57.662 --> 00:40:00.865]  His eyes the size of saucers, saying, oh, it's the Matrix.
[00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:01.946]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:40:01.946 --> 00:40:02.226]  Right.
[00:40:04.083 --> 00:40:18.749]  If you would, read... to look at Jolly West and Ewan Cameron and some of the others, you might look at a book called Blue Bird that gets into how there really was Manchurian candidates and others facilitated by the CIA.
[00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:19.970]  Who is that book written by?
[00:40:21.154 --> 00:40:23.275]  Dr. Ross, R-O-S-S.
[00:40:23.275 --> 00:40:35.739]  Well, I mean, Jolly and West ran things for the CIA at a campus in Canada, kidnapped hundreds and in some cases thousands of people, would keep them for years, give them new personalities, electroshock, drugs, torture.
[00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:37.579]  That's admitted, folks!
[00:40:37.579 --> 00:40:39.860]  That's on History Channel!
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:43.181]  And did he visit Tim McVeigh?
[00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:46.802]  Well, not you and Cameron, but the West certainly did.
[00:40:46.802 --> 00:40:47.022]  Right.
[00:40:47.614 --> 00:40:53.858]  Yeah, you and Cameron was, well actually, you also headed the American Psychological Corporation.
[00:40:53.858 --> 00:40:58.200]  That's why I don't see why nobody's not in jail.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.303]  I mean, you know, we got all this so-called evidence and
[00:41:02.816 --> 00:41:04.699]  You know, nothing happens to them.
[00:41:04.699 --> 00:41:12.910]  You know, they commit crimes, they kill as many people as they want to, and they whim, and you know... Well, that's what tyrants do, but they don't have total power yet.
[00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.312]  We're fighting, people are waking up.
[00:41:14.312 --> 00:41:14.933]  Thanks for the call.
[00:41:14.933 --> 00:41:15.994]  Dr. Cotty, stay with us.
[00:41:15.994 --> 00:41:19.699]  We're going to get more into this and talk to Ted, Kenny, Bob, and others.
[00:41:21.121 --> 00:41:24.983]  We'll also, right when we get back, we're going to plug your books and how folks get those.
[00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:27.444]  People get a pen and paper ready.
[00:41:27.444 --> 00:41:31.185]  He also writes for World Ed Daily and many other publications.
[00:41:31.185 --> 00:41:36.288]  We'll be right back with Dr. Dennis Cuddy, link through to some of his articles at InfoWars.com.
[00:41:36.288 --> 00:41:37.448]  Third hour coming up, stay with me.
[00:41:50.731 --> 00:41:57.555]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk Archives, and we are listener-supported with the Honors System.
[00:41:57.555 --> 00:41:59.196]  We ask that you wait.
[00:41:59.196 --> 00:42:01.078]  Don't donate a dollar at a time.
[00:42:01.078 --> 00:42:06.661]  PayPal charges a 35-cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[00:42:06.661 --> 00:42:10.163]  Wait till you listen to five or ten, and then donate, please.
[00:42:10.163 --> 00:42:12.465]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:18.883]  Big Brother.
[00:42:18.883 --> 00:42:20.644]  Mainstream media.
[00:42:20.644 --> 00:42:22.445]  Government cover-ups.
[00:42:22.445 --> 00:42:23.985]  You want answers?
[00:42:23.985 --> 00:42:25.546]  Well, so does he.
[00:42:25.546 --> 00:42:29.747]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:34.069]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:40.772]  Already in the third and final
[00:42:43.248 --> 00:42:44.649]  ...of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:42:44.649 --> 00:42:47.571]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:42:47.571 --> 00:42:48.791]  until 2 p.m.
[00:42:48.791 --> 00:42:51.893]  Central Standard Time, then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:42:51.893 --> 00:42:59.538]  Blasting out on a growing list of wonderful AM and FM affiliates from New York to Florida to Rhode Island and Northern California to Texas and Colorado and you name it.
[00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:12.915]  The websites are InfoWars.com and Net, and we're on the shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 at 12.172 and 93.20, and at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:43:12.915 --> 00:43:18.839]  We have Dr. Dennis Cuddy, an incredible author, an incredible researcher, and exposing the New World Order for many years.
[00:43:18.839 --> 00:43:21.040]  We've got a lot of callers who want to talk to him.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.602]  We're about to go to Ted and others, but first off, Dr. Cuddy, how do folks get your books?
[00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:26.623]  What books do you recommend?
[00:43:26.623 --> 00:43:27.884]  I've read several of them.
[00:43:27.884 --> 00:43:28.424]  They're excellent.
[00:43:29.548 --> 00:43:35.910]  Well, most of them can be obtained from toll-free number 888-891-3300.
[00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:40.971]  That's 888-891-3300.
[00:43:40.971 --> 00:43:58.116]  And the reason I was glad you asked the listeners to your program, who are sizable in number, to have a pencil ready is even if you can't buy that book yourself,
[00:43:59.155 --> 00:44:10.241]  You should at least, at the very least, everybody listening can look at that book for free by simply asking your local public library to purchase it for you.
[00:44:10.241 --> 00:44:11.921]  Then you can check it out.
[00:44:11.921 --> 00:44:16.904]  So, it's important to jot that number down, and among the books are the most recent just out.
[00:44:16.904 --> 00:44:22.066]  It's called Cover Up, and I want to give a brief comment about the relevance to that today.
[00:44:22.066 --> 00:44:27.229]  It regards September 11th, the war with Iraq, and our vanishing constitutional rights.
[00:44:28.024 --> 00:44:32.167]  Before that was one called September 11th, Prior Knowledge.
[00:44:32.167 --> 00:44:37.450]  Prior to that is The Globalist, The Paralete Exposed, the term Alex has been using.
[00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:43.153]  Prior to that, Secret Records Revealed, it's about Cecil Rhodes and Rhodes Scholars and so on, plan to take over the world.
[00:44:43.153 --> 00:44:53.279]  And before that, one called Now is the Dawning of the New Age, New World Order, which sort of encapsulates those two concepts when they were first brought to our attention.
[00:44:53.279 --> 00:44:54.000]  And by the way,
[00:44:57.017 --> 00:44:58.077]  There's gonna be more chair.
[00:44:58.077 --> 00:44:59.818]  I mean, this is so convenient for him.
[00:44:59.818 --> 00:45:03.018]  First, Bin Laden gotta get him, then forget about him, now it's Saddam.
[00:45:03.018 --> 00:45:05.319]  Okay, Saddam's gone, now Bin Laden's back.
[00:45:05.319 --> 00:45:18.502]  All these convenient bombings legitimizing everything, and it comes out the Karloff Group owned the company that got bombed, and it turns out it was a quote, L.A., uh, excuse me, London Times, uh, they're there saying that it was a quote, C.I.E.
[00:45:18.502 --> 00:45:18.862]  front.
[00:45:18.862 --> 00:45:21.183]  I mean, this is all, this stinks to high heaven.
[00:45:22.122 --> 00:45:28.043]  Well, there's a lot of, like my sort of subtitle on this latest book is about connecting the dots.
[00:45:28.043 --> 00:45:30.504]  And two quick points here.
[00:45:30.504 --> 00:45:37.165]  What you just said, the quotes that you referred to, London Times and so forth, there's a lot of these key people showing up at key places.
[00:45:37.165 --> 00:45:44.947]  For example, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld has been talking about the axis of the evil and we've got to get tough on North Korea and so on.
[00:45:45.695 --> 00:46:00.405]  And what some of your listeners may not be aware of is that in 2000, the year 2000, he was on the board of a Zurich-based energy company, ACB, which sold two light-water nuclear reactors to North Korea.
[00:46:00.405 --> 00:46:05.309]  So, you know, to what extent are we going to hold Rumsfeld accountable?
[00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:12.954]  And quickly, that hooks up with We Are Last Caller, where he's talking about no one pays or is accountable, and then what you just said,
[00:46:13.826 --> 00:46:14.407]  I don't think so.
[00:46:30.208 --> 00:46:44.237]  But now you find out just a week ago, Senator Bob Graham, head of the Intelligence Committee, was saying on Face the Nation, quote, I think what they, the administration, are shooting at is to cover up the failures that occurred before September 11th.
[00:46:44.237 --> 00:46:46.999]  Bob Schieffer says, are you accusing them of a cover-up?
[00:46:46.999 --> 00:46:49.421]  He says, yes, that's exactly right.
[00:46:49.421 --> 00:46:52.523]  And when we get back from the break, I'll tell you about my phone call to Newsweek.
[00:47:00.969 --> 00:47:04.032]  They've got us up against the ropes just slamming us.
[00:47:04.032 --> 00:47:07.875]  And you've got Pearl running around giving speeches about how to make money off war.
[00:47:07.875 --> 00:47:16.023]  You've got Cheney making all these billions off... It's incredible.
[00:47:16.023 --> 00:47:18.826]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:47:18.826 --> 00:47:21.609]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:23.124 --> 00:47:29.266]  I know about the crimes of the globalists.
[00:47:29.266 --> 00:47:30.067]  They're public.
[00:47:30.067 --> 00:47:31.247]  Thousands of them.
[00:47:31.247 --> 00:47:36.009]  But they tell us they're the authorities and we shouldn't ask questions and they're going to run our lives.
[00:47:36.009 --> 00:47:36.869]  I've seen note of that.
[00:47:36.869 --> 00:47:40.110]  We've got Dr. Cuddy for another 20 minutes or so.
[00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:43.552]  I know that his throat is, he's just had surgery.
[00:47:43.552 --> 00:47:45.953]  I appreciate him coming on with us.
[00:47:45.953 --> 00:47:50.914]  Before we go any further, let's give the number out for your books and let's give an address out or give websites out.
[00:47:50.914 --> 00:47:52.335]  You forgot to do that last segment.
[00:47:53.542 --> 00:48:04.344]  Well, the number on the books was the toll-free number, 888-891-3300.
[00:48:04.344 --> 00:48:06.865]  888-891-3300.
[00:48:06.865 --> 00:48:10.906]  And there's a couple of articles on World Net Daily.
[00:48:10.906 --> 00:48:13.867]  If you just go on there, there's a little box that does search.
[00:48:13.867 --> 00:48:15.167]  You can type in the name, Cuddy.
[00:48:15.982 --> 00:48:29.814]  And also on www.news.com, they have a particular site on the left side that says New World Order.
[00:48:29.814 --> 00:48:38.841]  You click on there and additional articles and up will come an addendum to my new book cover-up that will actually give most of the recent information.
[00:48:38.841 --> 00:48:41.564]  What is that, about 30 pages long?
[00:48:41.564 --> 00:48:43.505]  Yes, about that length.
[00:48:44.938 --> 00:48:49.659]  What's been uncovered, let's say, during the last month or so, plus additional stuff.
[00:48:49.659 --> 00:48:51.980]  I'll put Semiramis with her seven raids.
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:56.141]  Well, I'll tell you, you know, the FOX are, and I'll say it, the Lobalysts didn't have prior knowledge.
[00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:57.802]  They carry 9-1-1 out.
[00:48:57.802 --> 00:49:03.023]  There isn't a jury in the world that was honest if you showed them the evidence that wouldn't convict a Lobalyst of it.
[00:49:03.023 --> 00:49:14.086]  Well, that leads me sort of into what I was saying just before the break, and that is, because I have been interested, as you are, in who knew what, when, and where,
[00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:19.634]  I was curious, there were a couple of Newsweek articles right after September 11th.
[00:49:19.634 --> 00:49:29.461]  The first one, September 13th, by Michael Hirsch, and then two other authors, Evan Thomas, the head of Newsweek's Washington Bureau, and Mark Hosenball on the 24th.
[00:49:30.562 --> 00:49:40.932]  And so I call up Hirsch and I say, what about this report that these top Pentagon officials, the day before September 11th, suddenly canceled their travel plans for the next morning?
[00:49:40.932 --> 00:49:47.078]  For those that don't know, before they got all their lines straight, an early MSNBC slash Newsweek actually reported that.
[00:49:47.918 --> 00:49:49.278]  Uh, yeah.
[00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:53.179]  Uh, so I said the next morning, because of security concerns, to cancel it.
[00:49:53.179 --> 00:49:55.279]  He says, well, uh, what are you talking about?
[00:49:55.279 --> 00:49:57.180]  So I, you know, read him from his own article.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.820]  He said, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you want to talk to Mark Hosenbaugh.
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.141]  I said, you mean not Evan Thomas, the head of the Bureau?
[00:50:02.141 --> 00:50:03.781]  No, no, Mark Hosenbaugh.
[00:50:03.781 --> 00:50:05.641]  So I call him up, and he's not there.
[00:50:05.641 --> 00:50:06.941]  I leave a message.
[00:50:06.941 --> 00:50:07.901]  It's 635.
[00:50:07.901 --> 00:50:11.742]  He calls back, uh, on the, uh, 8th of May.
[00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:15.783]  And I asked him, I said, if he had found out who the top Pentagon officials were.
[00:50:15.783 --> 00:50:16.583]  He said, no.
[00:50:17.223 --> 00:50:21.744]  I said, did you not ask who they were, or did you ask, and they wouldn't?
[00:50:21.744 --> 00:50:35.008]  That's kind of a big deal the day before they admit this, and we have Mayor Willie Brown in the San Francisco Chronicle saying, I got a call home on the flood in New York that day, the London Times reported, that Salman Rushdie was banned from flying that month to the U.S.
[00:50:35.008 --> 00:50:38.929]  for his quote, safety, and that's just one small facet of this.
[00:50:38.929 --> 00:50:44.271]  It's like Bush being on anthrax, I mean being on the Cipro that fights anthrax.
[00:50:46.175 --> 00:50:52.297]  About four weeks before it shows up in Boca Raton, I mean, these questions, the media is not asking blaring, red flag questions.
[00:50:52.297 --> 00:50:52.977]  But what did he say?
[00:50:52.977 --> 00:50:53.697]  Go ahead.
[00:50:53.697 --> 00:50:59.199]  Okay, uh, he had said no, and then I said, did you not ask who they were, or did you ask and they wouldn't tell you?
[00:50:59.199 --> 00:51:04.941]  And he paused for a minute and said, quote, I don't want to talk about it anymore, end quote.
[00:51:04.941 --> 00:51:07.662]  So, to me, that was extremely revealing.
[00:51:07.662 --> 00:51:13.144]  Yeah, the media, you could have said, oh, it was a mistake, or we don't want to discuss, yeah, no, we don't want to talk about it.
[00:51:13.144 --> 00:51:14.504]  Or had he been told not to?
[00:51:15.765 --> 00:51:17.585]  Well, you know, I called Lou Cacioli up.
[00:51:17.585 --> 00:51:21.146]  You know, he's one of the firemen that said bombs were going off, explosions.
[00:51:21.146 --> 00:51:24.547]  It turns out that the radios did malfunction in the towers.
[00:51:24.547 --> 00:51:25.947]  Turns out they told him to shut up.
[00:51:25.947 --> 00:51:27.327]  New York Daily News has reported.
[00:51:27.327 --> 00:51:30.028]  They've grabbed all the audio tapes and the video interviews they did.
[00:51:30.028 --> 00:51:34.109]  They're even trying to, you know, classify all the whitewash hearings themselves.
[00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:36.949]  And I call Cacioli up, and his wife goes, look, we're afraid.
[00:51:36.949 --> 00:51:38.090]  We can't really talk.
[00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:39.950]  I talk to him, and he goes, look, I can't talk to you.
[00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:41.310]  I haven't told him to talk to anybody.
[00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.831]  I mean, our government's calling firefighters up and saying, shut up.
[00:51:46.285 --> 00:51:48.646]  Reminds you of Oklahoma City, doesn't it?
[00:51:48.646 --> 00:51:51.568]  Yeah, it sure does.
[00:51:51.568 --> 00:51:52.708]  Did he sound scared?
[00:51:52.708 --> 00:51:55.689]  I mean, how did he say, I don't want to talk about it.
[00:51:55.689 --> 00:51:58.370]  Nervous.
[00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:59.211]  Nervous.
[00:51:59.211 --> 00:52:01.692]  Like he wanted to cut it off right there.
[00:52:01.692 --> 00:52:10.656]  You know, that's just one point out of hundreds that are all documented, like hijackers at many of those military bases from Monterey, California to Pensacola.
[00:52:11.391 --> 00:52:14.493]  Yeah, and that also explains what I may have mentioned in the last program.
[00:52:14.493 --> 00:52:17.955]  It seems strange to me that back in 1995 we were conducting military exercises
[00:52:42.901 --> 00:52:46.463]  The Russians, pardon me, not in Leningrad or St.
[00:52:46.463 --> 00:53:06.058]  Petersburg or Moscow, but in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and so on, until you realize that back in 1952 this World Association of Parliamentarians for World Government actually developed a map which said that when the new world order, the world government would come about, that's one of the places our troops would be policing.
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.622]  I'm tired of plugging him.
[00:53:08.622 --> 00:53:09.804]  Please don't buy the book, folks.
[00:53:17.845 --> 00:53:19.447]  Please, I have to keep plugging in.
[00:53:19.447 --> 00:53:21.208]  I've given the guy so much publicity.
[00:53:21.208 --> 00:53:22.890]  The Grand Chess Board, he's so evil.
[00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:26.794]  The founder of the Trilateral Commission says, we need a Pearl Harbor event.
[00:53:26.794 --> 00:53:27.695]  We need to be attacked.
[00:53:27.695 --> 00:53:28.736]  Lots of attacks.
[00:53:28.736 --> 00:53:32.640]  This war for empire, to unify the people for our new world order.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.964]  You've got the Project for a New American Century saying that they're going to do all this.
[00:53:36.964 --> 00:53:39.166]  We need a Pearl Harbor catastrophic event.
[00:53:39.166 --> 00:53:41.729]  We've got their own handbooks on how they're going to do it.
[00:53:42.775 --> 00:53:52.601]  Didn't the PNAC people say, whenever they were asked if a war against Iraq would cause the terrorist attack, didn't they all say, oh no, it'd make it much safer for America?
[00:53:52.601 --> 00:53:55.923]  And then look at Riyadh and Casablanca.
[00:53:55.923 --> 00:53:56.943]  Well, they're not going to stop.
[00:53:56.943 --> 00:53:59.085]  I mean, they need this to legitimize what they've done.
[00:53:59.085 --> 00:54:00.365]  It's another smokescreen.
[00:54:00.365 --> 00:54:02.607]  Let's talk to Ted in Georgia.
[00:54:02.607 --> 00:54:02.947]  Yes.
[00:54:02.947 --> 00:54:03.567]  Right on the air.
[00:54:03.567 --> 00:54:04.068]  Go ahead.
[00:54:04.068 --> 00:54:05.088]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:54:05.088 --> 00:54:07.650]  Dr. Cuddy, how do you spell your name?
[00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:10.371]  C-U-D isn't David.
[00:54:10.371 --> 00:54:11.392]  D isn't David.
[00:54:11.392 --> 00:54:11.632]  Why?
[00:54:12.492 --> 00:54:14.093]  Well, C-U-D-D-Y.
[00:54:14.093 --> 00:54:15.054]  Yes, sir.
[00:54:15.054 --> 00:54:15.855]  I say fine.
[00:54:15.855 --> 00:54:22.080]  I think I, like probably a lot of other people from hearing it, would think it was T-T-Y.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.262]  That's the alcoholic beverage.
[00:54:24.262 --> 00:54:26.543]  No, that's not it.
[00:54:26.543 --> 00:54:29.065]  I'm not familiar with that.
[00:54:29.065 --> 00:54:40.815]  I have several points, but the most important one is the fact that I believe that it's not a quick total fix, but it's certainly
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.040]  We're good to go.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:14.747]  These guys are growing government, going after our guys, open borders, supercomputers in China, and the neocon whores on talk radio are worshipping this system.
[00:55:14.747 --> 00:55:16.688]  Dr. Cuddy, any comments?
[00:55:16.688 --> 00:55:24.473]  The origin of the neocons of this particular element, and they were the ones who, and I mapped out before the strategy for getting
[00:55:24.753 --> 00:55:33.854]  By the way, there was just an article about the neocons, their Strauss guy up in Chicago, this guy who left Germany, and saying he liked dictatorships.
[00:55:35.304 --> 00:55:54.381]  Well, when you go back to Trotsky, Trotsky got an accident in Mexico because, disagreeing with Stalin, what he had wanted was sort of the Gramscian approach, where you would attack the culture, you wouldn't be so much a violent revolution, but you'd change the consciousness of people.
[00:55:54.381 --> 00:55:58.684]  But nevertheless, it's still a dictatorship, so ultimately that would be the goal.
[00:55:58.684 --> 00:55:59.385]  Yeah, big brother.
[00:56:01.394 --> 00:56:02.055]  Absolutely.
[00:56:02.055 --> 00:56:02.895]  Anything else, sir?
[00:56:02.895 --> 00:56:04.796]  Yes, I would like to mention this.
[00:56:04.796 --> 00:56:08.179]  I read recently a rather startling article.
[00:56:08.179 --> 00:56:21.107]  It said that Bolsheviks were excluded from the KGB back after 1977, and that 15,000 of them came to the United States.
[00:56:21.107 --> 00:56:23.789]  I know that's speculative to me, but I just wondered if
[00:56:24.662 --> 00:56:27.685]  Dr. Cutt, do you have any remarks on that?
[00:56:27.685 --> 00:56:34.391]  Well, there have been various aspects to this, and let me further along what you said.
[00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:45.641]  There's always been sort of a coordination and a getting along with various intelligence networks, whether they're KGB types or whatever, but before my time is up,
[00:56:47.062 --> 00:56:49.824]  Don't just look at it from the left.
[00:56:49.824 --> 00:56:53.587]  The dialect, the synthesis has to have the right end, too.
[00:56:53.587 --> 00:57:02.315]  So what you have is not only your Operation Paperclip type, where you bring over the Nazis, but it's important to note, I'll just give one example.
[00:57:02.315 --> 00:57:07.699]  In 1944, Sumner Wells, a leading official of the U.S., wrote a book which was writing in 43.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:09.620]  I don't think so.
[00:57:25.794 --> 00:57:27.055]  Or propaganda to do it.
[00:57:27.055 --> 00:57:29.516]  And look, murderous people are at a premium.
[00:57:29.516 --> 00:57:38.760]  So whether you're a KGB murdering thug or a Nazi murdering thug, the globalists have positions for you because they're having trouble finding all the truly ruthless people they need.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:43.322]  And folks, we'd be in a much worse position if they could have the evil folks they needed.
[00:57:43.322 --> 00:57:48.304]  That's why they're saying torture and evil is good on the news, trying to mutate the souls of the general public.
[00:57:48.444 --> 00:57:50.445]  Would you agree with that, Dr. Cuddy?
[00:57:50.445 --> 00:57:51.725]  Sure.
[00:57:51.725 --> 00:57:54.306]  And the personnel is the key.
[00:57:54.306 --> 00:57:57.947]  They would send underground to two successive countries, individuals.
[00:57:57.947 --> 00:58:06.350]  And so later you had Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary General of the UN, and somebody named Paul Dickoff, former Nazi, became head of Interpol.
[00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:09.291]  What better way to keep up with people in Texas and everywhere else?
[00:58:10.757 --> 00:58:13.738]  Yeah, a full-time SS Gestapo officer running the U.N.
[00:58:13.738 --> 00:58:15.558]  from 1972 to 1982 when it came out.
[00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:19.579]  They protected him and all these liberals and all these minority groups think the U.N.
[00:58:19.579 --> 00:58:20.499]  is going to help you.
[00:58:20.499 --> 00:58:22.020]  Yeah, go ahead and take your vaccines.
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:24.360]  They love you.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.341]  Exactly.
[00:58:25.341 --> 00:58:26.621]  It's incredible.
[00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:28.101]  Thank you, Ted.
[00:58:28.101 --> 00:58:29.262]  Thank you.
[00:58:29.262 --> 00:58:31.122]  Dr. Cuddy, can you stay with us a little bit longer?
[00:58:31.122 --> 00:58:32.102]  Okay.
[00:58:32.102 --> 00:58:33.803]  How long can your voice hold up?
[00:58:33.803 --> 00:58:34.203]  We'll see.
[00:58:35.346 --> 00:58:41.489]  Well, I just want to get a ballpark because we've got a lot of callers who want to talk to you, but if you need to go now or in ten minutes, just give me an idea.
[00:58:41.489 --> 00:58:42.349]  Later.
[00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:43.410]  Ten, twenty minutes.
[00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:44.810]  Okay, well I'll keep you twenty minutes then.
[00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:47.371]  Anytime you need to go, know you had pro surgery.
[00:58:47.371 --> 00:58:48.212]  We appreciate you.
[00:58:48.212 --> 00:58:51.333]  Let's get a cold drink of water or lozenges or whatever.
[00:58:51.333 --> 00:58:52.254]  We really appreciate you.
[00:58:52.254 --> 00:58:53.054]  This is so important.
[00:58:53.054 --> 00:58:54.234]  I got them right here.
[00:58:54.234 --> 00:58:56.155]  Alright.
[00:58:56.155 --> 00:58:56.555]  I know.
[00:58:56.555 --> 00:58:57.336]  I'm a talk show host.
[00:58:57.336 --> 00:59:00.077]  When I have a cold or something, it's tough doing three hours.
[00:59:00.077 --> 00:59:02.138]  Kenny, Bob and others, you're up next.
[00:59:03.582 --> 00:59:04.744]  Total free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:59:04.744 --> 00:59:05.124]  800-259-9231.
[00:59:05.124 --> 00:59:06.887]  I got some news, current news items too.
[00:59:06.887 --> 00:59:09.370]  I want to get Dr. Cuddy's response and take on.
[00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:09.691]  Stay with us.
[00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:32.266]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk Archives, and we are listener-supported with the Honors System.
[00:59:32.266 --> 00:59:33.907]  We ask that you wait.
[00:59:33.907 --> 00:59:35.808]  Don't donate a dollar at a time.
[00:59:35.808 --> 00:59:40.892]  PayPal charges a 35-cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[00:59:41.372 --> 00:59:44.873]  Wait till you listen to five or ten, and then donate, please.
[00:59:44.873 --> 00:59:48.935]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[00:59:48.935 --> 00:59:55.557]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:59:55.557 --> 01:00:00.639]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:01.519]  It is May 19th.
[01:00:01.519 --> 01:00:02.660]  We've got Dr. Cuddy.
[01:00:04.441 --> 01:00:05.142]  Back on with us.
[01:00:05.142 --> 01:00:06.202]  I had him on a few weeks ago.
[01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:14.427]  We re-aired an interview Friday and I have him back on because I want to have him get his knowledge on the New World War and I found it all to be very accurate.
[01:00:14.427 --> 01:00:16.268]  Let's talk to Kenny in Wisconsin.
[01:00:16.268 --> 01:00:17.188]  Kenny, you're on the air.
[01:00:17.188 --> 01:00:17.749]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:17.749 --> 01:00:18.249]  Go ahead.
[01:00:18.249 --> 01:00:19.530]  Yes, thank you very much.
[01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:21.391]  Hello, Dr. Cuddy.
[01:00:21.391 --> 01:00:22.031]  Hello, sir.
[01:00:22.031 --> 01:00:25.553]  Are you aware of the Paris Peace Treaty, the Peace Treaty of 1783?
[01:00:28.362 --> 01:00:29.423]  Uh, yeah.
[01:00:29.423 --> 01:00:30.643]  Okay.
[01:00:30.643 --> 01:00:37.107]  A website for those that do not know where to find it is earlyamerica.com.
[01:00:37.107 --> 01:00:47.092]  Now, from another website called findlaw.com, hopefully to narrow the focus of who's in control, I got just a couple of quips.
[01:00:47.092 --> 01:00:50.253]  Britain is owned by the Vatican, Treaty of 1213.
[01:00:50.253 --> 01:00:51.854]  America is a British colony.
[01:00:55.842 --> 01:01:00.004]  The United States, capital letters, is a corporation, not a land mass.
[01:01:00.004 --> 01:01:06.928]  Well, certainly treaties have been signed, but to say that the Vatican runs everything, I'm not a Catholic, I'm not defending the Vatican, would be very corrupt.
[01:01:06.928 --> 01:01:10.109]  But the point here is, is that they had wars then.
[01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:12.170]  I mean, look at what Henry VIII did.
[01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:16.412]  They broke away, and there are certainly still agents in control, and you have different power blocks.
[01:01:16.412 --> 01:01:23.196]  In fact, Dr. Cuddy, who would you say is the dominant force, or the dominant clique, that owns most of the stock in the private banks?
[01:01:24.717 --> 01:01:30.902]  Uh, well, uh, it's tricky because there's a funneling mechanism.
[01:01:30.902 --> 01:01:40.129]  A lot of people think it's British, but if you go down deep, there is some Dutch money that actually helped found the Bank of England.
[01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:41.710]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:42.971]  That's what I, Dutch royalty, British royalty.
[01:01:42.971 --> 01:01:44.151]  Is that where Cromwell came in?
[01:01:44.151 --> 01:01:45.713]  Pardon me, sir?
[01:01:45.713 --> 01:01:47.334]  Is that where Cromwell came in?
[01:01:48.488 --> 01:02:12.251]  Cromwell was in the middle 1600s, and that's around the Bank of Amsterdam's time, and what they did is then after Charles II and James II, when they booted James II out, they, the Bank of Amsterdam, funded the establishment of the Bank of England in the early 1690s, and they quickly proceeded to get them in debt, which was their key control mechanism.
[01:02:12.751 --> 01:02:18.655]  Dr. Cuddy, I am holding in my hand a chart of who, in quotation marks, owns the Federal Reserve.
[01:02:18.655 --> 01:02:21.957]  I have no web yet, but I will get a URL.
[01:02:21.957 --> 01:02:38.969]  But on the back page it says, source, Federal Reserve Directors, colon, a study of corporate and banking influence, staff report, Committee on Banking, Currency and Housing, House of Representatives, 94th Congress,
[01:02:39.457 --> 01:02:41.898]  Second session, August of 76.
[01:02:41.898 --> 01:02:44.019]  It is drawn out beautifully.
[01:02:44.019 --> 01:02:45.459]  It's all bar graph money.
[01:02:45.459 --> 01:02:46.220]  No, I've seen it.
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:46.860]  I've seen it.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.401]  It looks like a family tree.
[01:02:48.401 --> 01:02:53.623]  The Europeans are the predominant stock in our central bank.
[01:02:53.623 --> 01:02:54.963]  My opinion?
[01:02:54.963 --> 01:02:55.383]  Sure.
[01:02:55.383 --> 01:02:56.824]  Well, we don't have to go off opinion.
[01:02:56.824 --> 01:02:58.745]  We know who the families are, but go ahead.
[01:02:58.745 --> 01:03:00.445]  Oh, no.
[01:03:00.445 --> 01:03:07.328]  I just wanted to add to this also that the IMF is an agency of the UN, and that's a black sloth six-fed.
[01:03:08.937 --> 01:03:15.759]  And also that New York is defined in the federal regulations as the United Nations.
[01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:20.961]  And when Rudolph Giuliani stated on CPAN that... We're the capital of the world.
[01:03:20.961 --> 01:03:23.701]  Yeah, New York City was the capital of the world, end quote.
[01:03:23.701 --> 01:03:25.122]  He was correct.
[01:03:25.122 --> 01:03:27.923]  And that is found at CFR Chapter 111.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.281]  Dr. Cutty, comments to what he's saying?
[01:03:32.281 --> 01:03:46.167]  Well, even taking that one step further in terms of just biblical end times, you know Revelation 18 and what happens there, and it has to be a port city, and everybody says New York, and everybody says, well, that was the World Trade Center.
[01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:56.632]  I don't think so, because when you get around verse 22, remember it says, and a candle would be seen no more, and that would be symbolic of the Statue of Liberty.
[01:03:58.243 --> 01:03:58.703]  Okay.
[01:03:58.703 --> 01:04:00.524]  So something may be coming up.
[01:04:00.524 --> 01:04:03.446]  Thank you very much.
[01:04:03.446 --> 01:04:04.726]  Amazing information.
[01:04:04.726 --> 01:04:07.228]  Let's talk to Bob in Texas.
[01:04:07.228 --> 01:04:08.028]  Bob, you're on the air.
[01:04:08.028 --> 01:04:08.669]  Go ahead.
[01:04:08.669 --> 01:04:10.289]  Yes, very good show today.
[01:04:10.289 --> 01:04:16.993]  My question's a little bit off topic, but I was wondering if either one of you happen to know what might have happened to Bob Chapman, the gold expert?
[01:04:16.993 --> 01:04:18.154]  No, I don't.
[01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.254]  No, I don't know.
[01:04:19.254 --> 01:04:19.914]  Okay.
[01:04:19.914 --> 01:04:23.396]  We've had Bob on as a guest, but he's still writing his newsletters.
[01:04:23.396 --> 01:04:26.538]  Basically, he's been criticizing the bankers and we're a little bit angry with him, but go ahead.
[01:04:27.911 --> 01:04:29.512]  Okay, that was quite a smart question.
[01:04:29.512 --> 01:04:36.998]  You also mentioned it on a former show, something about when new money came out, we wouldn't be able to power up our mortgages with the old money or something like that.
[01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:37.519]  Yeah, that's good.
[01:04:37.519 --> 01:04:54.512]  Well, the Federal Reserve has said they want to phase out the old green money, issue the new colored money, not issue as much of it so you physically can't pay the debt off, while driving down the value of that new money and making the old green money worthless worldwide, killing the dollar as a world reserve currency, which they're now doing, bad-mouthing it daily.
[01:04:54.512 --> 01:04:55.573]  Dr. Cutty, any comments?
[01:04:56.495 --> 01:05:03.496]  Yeah, they must be following the Australian colored money and unfortunately the way the Australian economy went as well.
[01:05:05.461 --> 01:05:07.262]  People say, but they don't want to hurt the economy.
[01:05:07.262 --> 01:05:07.963]  Yes, they do.
[01:05:07.963 --> 01:05:10.564]  That's how they consolidate.
[01:05:10.564 --> 01:05:14.447]  Yeah, they do, but it's a sort of a managed thing.
[01:05:14.447 --> 01:05:16.248]  I forget the name of that term.
[01:05:16.248 --> 01:05:24.834]  Back under Reagan's time, or the end of Reagan's time, Bush's time, they established sort of a, what they call a plummet protection team.
[01:05:24.834 --> 01:05:31.799]  So they want to drive the stock market down, but then they want to bring it to a halt to give their buddies a chance to get in and jack it up a bit.
[01:05:31.799 --> 01:05:34.600]  Well, yeah, Neville Switzerland said they want to plunge the dollar, but incrementally.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.061]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:36.501 --> 01:05:40.403]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:43.104]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:09.304]  Now I just want to bring up in our final minutes with Dr. Cuddy, current news items and his response to them.
[01:06:09.304 --> 01:06:14.347]  We'll tell you about his great books again before he leaves us.
[01:06:14.347 --> 01:06:27.775]  I first want to take a minute or two out to remind listeners that I produce award-winning, shocking, powerful, hard-hitting, information warfare devices known as videotapes.
[01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:31.817]  And I've made nine of them, and I've written a book, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:06:32.665 --> 01:06:35.025]  And the films are all over two hours long.
[01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:38.786]  Again, the key words, professionally produced.
[01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:46.347]  The greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us a scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn to its slavery man, woman and child.
[01:06:46.347 --> 01:06:51.508]  The United States government at all levels has fallen under the control of the desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[01:06:51.508 --> 01:07:01.350]  The events of September 11th marked the initiation of the final sick push by the Illuminati to consolidate their global One World Order and transform Earth into a prison planet.
[01:07:02.193 --> 01:07:11.401]  In over two and a half hours, two hours and thirty-seven minutes to be exact, I chronicle in stunning detail the true character of the Globalists, their crimes.
[01:07:11.401 --> 01:07:18.447]  Learn the master plan for the bloodthirsty elite, the financially, physically, and spiritually imprisoned not only America, but the world.
[01:07:18.447 --> 01:07:25.653]  Total Enslavement is the third installment in my critically acclaimed Police State series and is a must-see for all who love freedom.
[01:07:25.653 --> 01:07:30.377]  This film documents the nightmare rise of the Homeland Security dictatorship
[01:07:30.877 --> 01:07:38.961]  Patriot Acts 1 and 2, the Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery ring, the new prison surveillance economy, and much more.
[01:07:38.961 --> 01:07:50.186]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism and how the globalists pose as our saviors, when in fact they are the terrorists.
[01:07:50.186 --> 01:07:54.788]  Now that's the back cover of Police State 3 Total Enslavement, my newest film.
[01:07:54.788 --> 01:07:55.909]  You're nuts if you don't get it.
[01:07:57.461 --> 01:07:58.181]  And it's $25.95.
[01:07:58.181 --> 01:08:10.468]  I've got also 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, two-part films, both over two hours long, about who really carried out 9-1-1 and what their plan is and how to stop them.
[01:08:10.468 --> 01:08:11.548]  They're $20 a piece.
[01:08:11.548 --> 01:08:14.350]  When you get three or more, order the films today.
[01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:14.970]  Don't wait.
[01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:16.591]  Get the book as well.
[01:08:16.591 --> 01:08:19.932]  Make copies of the videos for non-profit, not-for-sale purposes.
[01:08:19.932 --> 01:08:21.413]  Get them out to everybody.
[01:08:21.413 --> 01:08:24.355]  Toll-free number to order right now is 1-888-
[01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:27.452]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:08:27.452 --> 01:08:28.352]  That's 888-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:08:28.352 --> 01:08:31.373]  4infowars.com or net to order.
[01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:32.434]  Stand up.
[01:08:32.434 --> 01:08:32.854]  Be bold.
[01:08:32.854 --> 01:08:33.554]  Get the films.
[01:08:33.554 --> 01:08:35.015]  Make copies.
[01:08:35.015 --> 01:08:36.595]  Spread the word.
[01:08:36.595 --> 01:08:39.496]  We outnumber the globalists 500 to 1.
[01:08:39.496 --> 01:08:40.476]  Again, that number, 1-888-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:08:54.898 --> 01:09:08.303]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:09:08.303 --> 01:09:09.163]  Take action.
[01:09:09.163 --> 01:09:11.464]  Make the call today.
[01:09:11.464 --> 01:09:12.904]  Hit the videos.
[01:09:12.904 --> 01:09:14.505]  Get the word out.
[01:09:14.505 --> 01:09:21.547]  Dr. Cuddy, one more time, your two newest books you recommend and how folks get those, because I have read your prior knowledge book.
[01:09:21.547 --> 01:09:23.728]  I haven't gotten a new one, but tell folks how they get them.
[01:09:25.179 --> 01:09:31.123]  Well, the current one is Cover Up, and you should be getting it any day now.
[01:09:31.123 --> 01:09:32.404]  I think I put it in the mail to you.
[01:09:32.404 --> 01:09:38.668]  It deals with September 11th, the war with Iraq, and the vanishing of constitutional rights.
[01:09:38.668 --> 01:09:44.411]  The toll-free number is 888-891-3300.
[01:09:44.411 --> 01:09:50.275]  And as I said, if somebody wants to read it for free, all they have to do is ask their local library to get it for them.
[01:09:50.962 --> 01:09:54.943]  Yeah, everybody should call and say, I want Dr. Dennis Cuddy's books in the library.
[01:09:54.943 --> 01:09:56.304]  I want Alex Jones's books.
[01:09:56.304 --> 01:09:57.124]  That's right.
[01:09:57.124 --> 01:09:59.525]  And tell them how to get them.
[01:09:59.525 --> 01:10:00.825]  I really do appreciate that.
[01:10:00.825 --> 01:10:02.806]  Now, I want to go over some news items with you.
[01:10:02.806 --> 01:10:03.346]  Again, U.S.
[01:10:03.346 --> 01:10:07.167]  stocks fall on soft dollar and weak retail sales.
[01:10:07.167 --> 01:10:09.868]  Reuters and it says Snow says this is good.
[01:10:09.868 --> 01:10:14.389]  A new Treasury Secretary, a dropping dollar, and all this is real good.
[01:10:14.389 --> 01:10:16.350]  Just any other comments about the plunging dollar?
[01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:17.010]  It is a big deal.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:25.549]  Yeah, and it is, like you said back about an hour ago, that it's a leveling process.
[01:10:25.549 --> 01:10:28.773]  You cannot have a one-nation dominant economy.
[01:10:29.444 --> 01:10:32.227]  The globalists are active in a world economy.
[01:10:32.227 --> 01:10:35.570]  And they're going to use this to play them off against each other and control them.
[01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:36.471]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:10:36.471 --> 01:10:43.638]  It's like rollerball, where one country's energy and another's manufacturing, and they're all controlled by this global syndicate, this corporation.
[01:10:43.638 --> 01:10:45.980]  Yeah, because you're supposed to parcel it out.
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:51.506]  If you're going to have regional arrangements, then little country X has to have something it can produce.
[01:10:51.966 --> 01:10:53.789]  Therefore, you have to limit the U.S.
[01:10:53.789 --> 01:10:59.337]  or whatever other countries from producing that, if you're going to have this sort of network of trade working.
[01:10:59.337 --> 01:11:03.403]  And therefore, you have to destroy certain industries in many countries.
[01:11:03.403 --> 01:11:05.466]  I understand the goal isn't trade.
[01:11:05.466 --> 01:11:07.730]  Trade is the gate to control, is one of the rights.
[01:11:08.169 --> 01:11:16.375]  Right, and even in the back of my Secret Records reveal, I show how back 2,000 years ago, that was the plan.
[01:11:16.375 --> 01:11:17.636]  Rome did this.
[01:11:17.636 --> 01:11:18.277]  Rome did this.
[01:11:18.277 --> 01:11:20.178]  They would only let certain areas produce certain things.
[01:11:20.178 --> 01:11:27.684]  I was re-reading the Battle for Gaul written by Julius Caesar, and he talked about how he would only let certain tribes produce certain things.
[01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:37.451]  Right, and in the Middle East, if whoever controlled the Via Maris, that trade route where they had fortified Har-Mageddon, that's the Har-Mageddon, they would control the world.
[01:11:38.888 --> 01:11:40.549]  It's amazing.
[01:11:40.549 --> 01:11:47.651]  The White House Press Secretary, a greedy lying creature, has now resigned.
[01:11:47.651 --> 01:11:49.231]  What do you think about that?
[01:11:49.231 --> 01:11:51.092]  It's what you just said a half an hour ago.
[01:11:51.092 --> 01:11:55.073]  He's going to go make some money on the book tour and the speaking circuit.
[01:11:55.073 --> 01:11:56.614]  Alright, so cashing in.
[01:11:58.559 --> 01:12:03.265]  Uh, Villagers vs. Oil Giant, Ashcroft at the Rescue, Asian Times.
[01:12:03.265 --> 01:12:06.369]  It says, in a move that provoked outrage from human rights groups here, U.S.
[01:12:06.369 --> 01:12:15.942]  Attorney General John Ashcroft has asked a federal appeals court to nullify a 214-year-old law that has provided foreign victims of serious abuses access to U.S.
[01:12:15.942 --> 01:12:16.643]  courts for readiness.
[01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:18.287]  No, I really haven't.
[01:12:32.708 --> 01:12:37.710]  What they're doing, Ashcroft's Justice Department has, well, a friend of the court.
[01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:39.390]  Well, it would fit, though.
[01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:44.192]  I mean, because what they're doing, even our Supreme Court is saying we have to look to international law.
[01:12:44.192 --> 01:12:47.693]  So that's going to impact international law, which then will come back on us.
[01:12:47.693 --> 01:12:50.594]  Yeah, so everything's got to go to the U.N., and they've got an amicus brief.
[01:12:51.463 --> 01:13:05.067]  On behalf of California-based oil giant Unicole, in a civil case brought by the Miami's Villagers who claim that the company responsible for serious abuses committed by army troops provided security for a company project.
[01:13:05.067 --> 01:13:08.588]  You know, the oil company's going around slaughtering villagers.
[01:13:08.588 --> 01:13:10.228]  So, they've got that.
[01:13:10.228 --> 01:13:18.631]  Also wanted to get into the PSYOPS, the Loves Not Manual, that's what it says.
[01:13:19.413 --> 01:13:19.614]  U.S.
[01:13:19.614 --> 01:13:24.554]  Army is using Metallica and Barney theme song as instruments of coercion in Iraq.
[01:13:25.237 --> 01:13:32.922]  It says in these re-education centers, MSNBC says, they blare satanic music with children's music to shock the Iraqis into submission.
[01:13:32.922 --> 01:13:35.083]  What does that sound like to you?
[01:13:35.083 --> 01:13:36.084]  Uh, two things.
[01:13:36.084 --> 01:13:39.306]  They played You're No Good, You're No Good to Noriega.
[01:13:39.306 --> 01:13:42.828]  It's outside the Vatican building in Panama.
[01:13:42.828 --> 01:13:51.754]  And then at Waco, they blared the killing of Little Rabbit and Dancy Sinatra saying these boots are made for walking and there's going to be a fire.
[01:13:53.627 --> 01:13:54.427]  That's it.
[01:13:54.427 --> 01:13:56.088]  And it says the idea, as Sgt.
[01:13:56.088 --> 01:14:04.289]  Mark had said, is to break a subject's resistance by annoying that person with what some Iraqis consider cultural offensive music.
[01:14:04.289 --> 01:14:10.010]  Songs that are being played include Van Diesel's XXX movie soundtrack and Metallica.
[01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:14.011]  And it says, along with children's songs, well this is what they're doing to our people.
[01:14:14.011 --> 01:14:17.132]  Again, but they tell them it's fashionable, they run out and do it.
[01:14:17.952 --> 01:14:29.240]  Uh, Theodore Adorno was part of this whole scenario, said fractious music could change the consciousness, and he was part of the, uh, Frankfurt School to change, uh, America.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:33.183]  And, uh, barbs aside, 9-1-1 questions aren't going away.
[01:14:33.183 --> 01:14:35.485]  Toronto starved.
[01:14:35.485 --> 01:14:40.528]  And it comes out where the Bush is saying he's not going to release any of the records on 9-1-1 now.
[01:14:40.528 --> 01:14:42.630]  No whitewashes, not even with Kissinger.
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:46.146]  And there are some convenient bombings to distract us.
[01:14:46.146 --> 01:14:47.408]  Where do you see this going?
[01:14:47.408 --> 01:14:51.556]  Just where 85% of the public knows that they did it a few years from now?
[01:14:51.556 --> 01:14:53.600]  Just like with Kennedy, but they still just ignore it?
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:53.800]  I mean...
[01:14:54.674 --> 01:14:58.736]  How are they going to get away with this, because everybody's learning about this, Doctor?
[01:14:58.736 --> 01:15:07.340]  Well, the first step, of course, is what they're doing to the 9-11 report, which is classifying a lot of the material so you can't get at it.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:14.162]  The second thing is, they have to set precedents, and so you have Clinton with the Monica Lewinsky trial,
[01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:32.596]  In effect, everybody knows he commits perjury, but they've conditioned the American public so that two-thirds of them say, we don't care as long as the economy's good, and so if enough time passes, people don't care that there was Operation Northwood, they don't care that JFK was fooling around, they don't care about anything.
[01:15:33.553 --> 01:15:37.475]  Well, I said many years ago, the last few years of Clinton in August, that he's a puppet.
[01:15:37.475 --> 01:15:39.736]  I'm not going to make my whole show about how he's a puppet.
[01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:40.397]  He's a minion.
[01:15:40.397 --> 01:15:41.778]  He's not running anything.
[01:15:41.778 --> 01:15:43.799]  He's meant to drag us to the mud.
[01:15:43.799 --> 01:15:48.741]  He's meant to get caught doing all of this to condition us, to acclimate us, to accept corruption.
[01:15:48.741 --> 01:15:50.102]  Yep.
[01:15:50.102 --> 01:15:50.803]  That's right.
[01:15:50.803 --> 01:15:52.463]  All right.
[01:15:52.463 --> 01:15:54.865]  Russia preparing for nuclear attacks on the U.S.
[01:15:54.865 --> 01:15:55.305]  and Britain.
[01:15:55.305 --> 01:16:00.268]  Newsmax reports Russia will launch a mock nuclear attack against the U.S.
[01:16:00.268 --> 01:16:02.329]  and Britain during military exercises over the week.
[01:16:03.314 --> 01:16:05.015]  Uh, and they're supposedly our big buddies.
[01:16:05.015 --> 01:16:06.537]  What do you think of that?
[01:16:06.537 --> 01:16:13.862]  Uh, once again, the plan was that if the Communist threat were greatly abated, the West would lose whatever incentive it had for world government, end quote.
[01:16:13.862 --> 01:16:18.046]  Lincoln Bloomfield's DFR under the Rhodes Scholar Dean Rusk in the early 60s
[01:16:18.826 --> 01:16:25.629]  You have to keep this massive potential threat in the psyche of Americans to make them compliant.
[01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:28.231]  And that's why Clinton gives supercomputers to China.
[01:16:28.231 --> 01:16:28.751]  It's bad.
[01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:30.171]  Bush takes all the controls off.
[01:16:30.171 --> 01:16:31.072]  It's good.
[01:16:31.072 --> 01:16:33.053]  That's why you give reactors in North Korea.
[01:16:33.053 --> 01:16:35.194]  You've got to build up that threat.
[01:16:35.194 --> 01:16:35.554]  That's right.
[01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:37.505]  Here's another one.
[01:16:37.505 --> 01:16:39.647]  Big Brother tracking you without a warrant.
[01:16:39.647 --> 01:16:43.951]  James Banford in the New York Times admitting that we're totally surveilled by the Pentagon.
[01:16:43.951 --> 01:16:45.974]  The Total Information Awareness Network.
[01:16:45.974 --> 01:16:47.615]  Isn't this about a chilling effect, though?
[01:16:47.615 --> 01:16:53.401]  Because they don't have the personnel to go listen to all that or do anything with it, even with keyword software.
[01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:57.145]  But isn't announcing we're being surveilled about creating a chilling effect?
[01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:57.806]  Isn't that part of it?
[01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:08.299]  Sure, the psychological impact is probably more important than, you know, Iridium or Echelon finding out if you used the word bomb at some point.
[01:17:09.445 --> 01:17:15.028]  Yeah, and imagine billions of phone calls, billions of faxes, emails, even with keyword stuff.
[01:17:15.028 --> 01:17:18.569]  It's like coming home and having 10,000 phone messages a day.
[01:17:18.569 --> 01:17:23.291]  Even if you could listen to them, they can't track it down, they can't do anything with it.
[01:17:23.291 --> 01:17:28.193]  They're telling you they're spying on you while leaving the borders open to train you except not having a Fourth Amendment.
[01:17:28.933 --> 01:17:31.854]  Yeah, but they will also get a little bit bolder.
[01:17:31.854 --> 01:17:38.155]  You may eventually have two-way television viewing in your home and so forth, unbeknownst to you.
[01:17:38.155 --> 01:17:38.635]  Well, hold on.
[01:17:38.635 --> 01:17:43.016]  Did you know that the new AMBER Alert system is really the FEMA EAS takeover system?
[01:17:43.016 --> 01:17:46.597]  I've had the FCC on about this years ago.
[01:17:46.597 --> 01:17:49.977]  And the new digital table boxes don't watch you physically.
[01:17:49.977 --> 01:17:57.479]  They create digital psychological algorithm databases, very detailed, a lot more than that psychological test they did for you in The Globalist.
[01:17:58.395 --> 01:18:01.118]  Uh, off your viewing habits.
[01:18:01.118 --> 01:18:04.662]  So, did you know the digital cable boxes are already literally watching your mind?
[01:18:04.662 --> 01:18:13.131]  Uh, at the very least, as I said back in the mid-70s, they could alter your brain waves remotely.
[01:18:13.131 --> 01:18:15.434]  Most people think that you have to play an electrode.
[01:18:15.434 --> 01:18:15.974]  No, no.
[01:18:15.974 --> 01:18:17.236]  Remotely, they can alter.
[01:18:17.236 --> 01:18:18.017]  Well, that was patented in 1954.
[01:18:20.207 --> 01:18:22.189]  Uh, I think in the mid-70s.
[01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:25.731]  Well, there was a device that could project audio into the head.
[01:18:25.731 --> 01:18:28.593]  In 1954, it was patented.
[01:18:28.593 --> 01:18:29.613]  Uh, okay, that one.
[01:18:29.613 --> 01:18:33.436]  But remote by satellite, they can alter your brainwaves.
[01:18:33.436 --> 01:18:34.336]  Sure.
[01:18:34.336 --> 01:18:37.639]  Now, I have a guy on who was in MSNBC last year, the CEO.
[01:18:37.639 --> 01:18:39.060]  They're already going in.
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:41.801]  Coke machines that beam an audio beam into your mind.
[01:18:41.801 --> 01:18:42.822]  Have you heard about that?
[01:18:42.822 --> 01:18:44.323]  Uh, no.
[01:18:44.323 --> 01:18:45.784]  Those are going to be in stores very soon.
[01:18:46.773 --> 01:18:51.396]  Well, prior to that, like I said, there was always a step-by-step process.
[01:18:51.396 --> 01:19:00.801]  I may have mentioned it before, there's a psychological meaning behind the new ads, rather than your cognitive, here are the five reasons to buy Nike or whatever.
[01:19:01.434 --> 01:19:10.443]  They create an image of flashing lights, swirling motions that are not ordinarily seen so that your brain changes from thinking to just receiving.
[01:19:10.443 --> 01:19:23.256]  So you're being, you're receiving constantly during a 30-second commercial images of a particular product, not just once on your mind, but many times so that your mind, when you come to buy sneakers, will buy that product.
[01:19:24.264 --> 01:19:26.645]  Switching off the thinking process.
[01:19:26.645 --> 01:19:29.747]  And by being conscious of it, that's a big part of the battle, isn't it?
[01:19:29.747 --> 01:19:30.407]  Uh, yeah.
[01:19:30.407 --> 01:19:38.490]  And this has been, I mean, the Hindus thousands of years ago used fast flickering candles for the same hypnotic effect.
[01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:41.752]  Well, that's where you get the flashing scrub lighter to the swinging watch.
[01:19:42.597 --> 01:19:45.258]  We got somebody lulled into a subconscious state.
[01:19:45.258 --> 01:19:53.482]  Yeah, and it's really for our own good, according to the current show called The Agency.
[01:19:53.482 --> 01:19:55.322]  You may have seen it about the CIA.
[01:19:55.322 --> 01:19:59.684]  Yeah, torture is good, mind control through TV is good, this is all good for us.
[01:19:59.684 --> 01:20:03.346]  The fellow on there is Mr. Quinn, the bald-headed guy.
[01:20:03.986 --> 01:20:11.729]  Well, back in 1980, there was a movie called The Agency, and the guy's name was Mr. Quinn, played by, I think, Robert Mitchum.
[01:20:11.729 --> 01:20:13.990]  And he says, oh yeah, the people want to be controlled.
[01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:15.231]  They want to be manipulated.
[01:20:15.231 --> 01:20:18.633]  And here's how we're going to psychologically do it.
[01:20:18.633 --> 01:20:19.473]  Well, in your face.
[01:20:20.323 --> 01:20:22.685]  Bilderberg convenes in Versailles.
[01:20:22.685 --> 01:20:26.068]  The annual meeting of the global elite kicked off mid-May in secrecy.
[01:20:26.068 --> 01:20:36.315]  However, two resourceful AFP correspondents were there to greet them, unveiling the world, what goes on behind closed doors when the world's most powerful meet, discuss pressing issues of the day.
[01:20:36.315 --> 01:20:44.862]  Tucker said on my show in January of last year, he said he was getting it from inside their meetings, that it would be an attack in mid-February or into March.
[01:20:45.535 --> 01:20:48.896]  He said it wouldn't be in 2002 like the media was saying.
[01:20:48.896 --> 01:20:49.616]  That was accurate.
[01:20:49.616 --> 01:20:51.657]  He's been very accurate in the past.
[01:20:51.657 --> 01:20:55.478]  He's saying the rift between America and European Bilderberg participants is widening over both the U.S.
[01:20:55.478 --> 01:20:59.999]  invasion of Iraq and blind, blank-check support of Israel's aggression against Palestinians.
[01:20:59.999 --> 01:21:01.820]  Scott, I don't really... Tucker's saying that.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:04.501]  I think, you know, that's all just surface stuff.
[01:21:04.501 --> 01:21:06.481]  These are hotly debated topics at Bilderberg.
[01:21:09.037 --> 01:21:12.321]  Filling the posh Palace Hotel, May 14th.
[01:21:12.321 --> 01:21:16.465]  Another issue on the Humboldt-Burger agenda is the proposed European Union army independent of NATO.
[01:21:16.465 --> 01:21:20.870]  Unlike the other two major issues, there's not a confrontation between Americans and Europeans.
[01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:24.313]  All Americans oppose the EU army, but so do many Europeans.
[01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:29.399]  Leading in the anti-army Euro faction is Lord George Robertson, Secretary General of NATO.
[01:21:29.399 --> 01:21:30.320]  What do you think about that?
[01:21:31.789 --> 01:21:35.912]  Yeah, Robertson and Sutherland.
[01:21:35.912 --> 01:21:44.378]  In fact, Sutherland is one that was with Rumsfeld as part of the board of that ABB, selling the nuclear reactors to North Korea.
[01:21:44.378 --> 01:21:48.281]  So they have their people going all over the place over the years.
[01:21:48.281 --> 01:21:51.003]  Robert Mueller was Assistant Secretary General of the UN.
[01:21:51.704 --> 01:21:52.405]  What's he doing?
[01:21:52.405 --> 01:22:02.259]  Now we've set up not only the University of Peace, but many schools around the country, including Arlington, Texas, based on Alice Bailey's teachings first published by Lucifer.
[01:22:02.259 --> 01:22:06.004]  And so there are these key individuals, whether it's Robertson or
[01:22:07.526 --> 01:22:14.629]  And by the way, every time you track them back, they're not Germans, they're not Jews, they're not Chinese.
[01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:17.891]  They're Luciferian Satanists.
[01:22:17.891 --> 01:22:20.833]  This is public information.
[01:22:20.833 --> 01:22:23.514]  How do they... I mean, this has even been in the news.
[01:22:23.514 --> 01:22:27.876]  MSNBC and USA Today have said, oh yeah, they do occult rituals.
[01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:30.898]  How do they get away with doing that and calling themselves Christian conservatives?
[01:22:31.942 --> 01:22:35.063]  Because the public lets them.
[01:22:35.063 --> 01:22:37.103]  Well, that's not really entirely true.
[01:22:37.103 --> 01:22:52.727]  The public has been conditioned, but there was a process to get us to this stage, like the frog in the boiling water gradually put to a particular temperature so you don't notice it until it's too late.
[01:22:52.727 --> 01:22:58.548]  So what they do is, as I said, Cecil Rhodes not only wanted economic, educational, and political
[01:22:59.088 --> 01:22:59.629]  That's a big lie.
[01:23:19.071 --> 01:23:19.572]  All right.
[01:23:19.572 --> 01:23:23.736]  Well, Dr. Cuddy, I really appreciate you coming on the show today, and Godspeed.
[01:23:23.736 --> 01:23:27.659]  I appreciate all the time, and we look forward to having you back on in the future.
[01:23:27.659 --> 01:23:28.040]  Okay.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:28.860]  Thanks for having me.
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:29.961]  Take care.
[01:23:29.961 --> 01:23:33.184]  Final segment, I've got a little news blitz for you.
[01:23:33.184 --> 01:23:36.007]  About 10 stories I'm going to hit on real quick.
[01:23:36.007 --> 01:23:39.831]  Wrap up this live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
