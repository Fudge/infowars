[00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:07.114]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:15.481]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:17.162]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:19.043]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:20.484]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:22.145]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:26.468]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.988 --> 00:00:31.050]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:55.446]  All right, my friends, welcome back to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:55.506 --> 00:00:58.067]  It's already Tuesday, the 26th of August, 2003.
[00:00:58.427 --> 00:01:02.709]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:10.531]  We have Colonel Craig Roberts coming on to talk about the latest events in the world, the bombings, the economy, the oil prices,
[00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:18.256]  Terrorism, big terrorism on the horizon, and a bunch of other key issues.
[00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:20.578]  We'll also have open phones.
[00:01:20.618 --> 00:01:24.501]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:25.082]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:25.102 --> 00:01:30.806]  We'll get you up and on the air on any of the different news items that are out there.
[00:01:41.445 --> 00:01:47.970]  All over the world they're moving to a centralized biometrically accessed ID card.
[00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:58.118]  It admittedly is being called a world ID card, but the general public has no idea of its existence as it's being implemented.
[00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.582]  It's the same thing with the satellite tracking and taxation of cell phones and cards.
[00:02:04.483 --> 00:02:07.365]  The first you'll know of it is when they announce it's the law.
[00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:11.675]  As they've been laying the infrastructure for years.
[00:02:11.755 --> 00:02:25.941]  And of course, when they announce it to you, which they've done now in Germany, England, Canada, and parts of the U.S., it will be for some emergency that just appeared, and then no one will put two and two together that it was set up six, seven, eight years ago.
[00:02:27.622 --> 00:02:28.762]  So, we'll get into that.
[00:02:28.842 --> 00:02:31.023]  Japan upgrades ID database.
[00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:32.084]  It's called Big Brother.
[00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:34.385]  Another article here, MSNBC.
[00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:35.945]  Deficit could top $500 billion in 2004.
[00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:43.953]  Folks, the Dallas Morning News reported that we have a $43 trillion deficit.
[00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:50.839]  $43 trillion, trillion, trillion dollar deficit, folks.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.862]  Also, bug uproar in Hawaii.
[00:02:54.922 --> 00:03:03.509]  They want to force other kids into the Hawaiian cultural schools by the aboriginal tribes that are left.
[00:03:04.737 --> 00:03:08.678]  They're saying it's racist that the Hawaiians want to keep their culture.
[00:03:08.718 --> 00:03:12.939]  See, the New World Order is about destroying everybody's culture.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:23.702]  And replacing it with an MTV, Nike, Tennessee Pepsi commercial of enslavement and death and SWAT teams blowing your guts all over the wall.
[00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:26.623]  That's the new America coming up.
[00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:31.239]  Growth at base shows firm stand on military detention.
[00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.900]  Big article out of the Miami Herald.
[00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:36.003]  They're pouring concrete, putting in execution centers.
[00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:50.275]  And they say that the camp will exist and expand, quote, it should exist as long as the global war on terrorism is ongoing, if it helps our nation and our allies win, said Camp Commander Major General Jeffrey Miller.
[00:03:51.474 --> 00:03:56.257]  We are exceptionally good at developing intelligence that will help defeat the scourge of terrorism.
[00:03:56.277 --> 00:04:05.703]  Of course, the former head of the camp, General Rick Buck, has resigned, refusing to torture the teenagers there who have nothing to do with Al-Qaeda or the CIA.
[00:04:05.723 --> 00:04:13.127]  A lot of news on protests from Cleveland to Salt Lake City to Boise yesterday.
[00:04:13.288 --> 00:04:17.210]  Photos of it are being posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.332]  We'll tell you about some of what some of the signs said.
[00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:26.640]  And trying to pull left-right paradigm on us, they have Janet Reno come out and criticize Ashcroft.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.061]  Not the Patriot Act.
[00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:29.221]  Oh, she's all for it.
[00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:30.982]  She criticized Ashcroft.
[00:04:31.022 --> 00:04:35.003]  That way the phony right wing can say, see, Reno's against Ashcroft.
[00:04:35.263 --> 00:04:36.744]  The Patriot Act must be good.
[00:04:37.164 --> 00:04:41.266]  And then get the right wing back in line when you read what Reno actually said.
[00:04:41.806 --> 00:04:44.287]  She's for the police state just criticizing Ashcroft.
[00:04:46.748 --> 00:04:47.108]  Also,
[00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.531]  I wrote a story a couple of weeks ago about DARPA, the Engineering the Beast System.
[00:04:53.772 --> 00:05:02.395]  The LA Times has written one, Army of Extreme Thinkers, that I could almost swear was from my story.
[00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:06.036]  Look, we haven't even hit the tip of the iceberg.
[00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:07.757]  Stay with us, big show.
[00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:14.626]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:14.826 --> 00:05:19.233]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:19.393 --> 00:05:23.780]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.162]  The New World Order.
[00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:27.722]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:51.087]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:51.287 --> 00:05:56.672]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:02.216]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:09.722 --> 00:06:12.043]  I've lost 10 pounds with the collagen aid so far.
[00:06:12.263 --> 00:06:12.983]  Give it a try.
[00:06:13.163 --> 00:06:13.923]  Worked good for me.
[00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:17.504]  I'm going to have to go off, get re-measured because my pants are getting kind of baggy on me.
[00:06:17.664 --> 00:06:19.124]  My stomach is not there no more.
[00:06:19.184 --> 00:06:20.124]  It's really very easy.
[00:06:20.325 --> 00:06:21.265]  Helps me sleep good.
[00:06:21.525 --> 00:06:22.045]  Lose weight.
[00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:22.885]  Tones me up.
[00:06:23.205 --> 00:06:23.805]  Hey, I like it.
[00:06:24.165 --> 00:06:30.927]  Trying to lose weight for someone in a wheelchair is extremely frustrating and the first month that I tried it, I lost 6 pounds.
[00:06:31.047 --> 00:06:31.987]  What are you waiting for?

[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.642]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:12.002 --> 00:07:17.747]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:18.007 --> 00:07:23.132]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:23.472 --> 00:07:32.761]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:38.046]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:07:38.386 --> 00:07:42.410]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.354]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:53.620]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:08:01.287 --> 00:08:02.188]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.530]  Big Brother.
[00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:17.231]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:19.072]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:20.532]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:22.213]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.853 --> 00:08:26.815]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.055 --> 00:08:31.177]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:34.938]  Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:41.501]  We're now 8 minutes and 30 seconds into this first hour of the Worldwide Tuesday Broadcast.
[00:08:43.385 --> 00:08:57.830]  And we're going to be taking your calls early in this hour on any of the news items that we're about to bring up or any news story that you would like to discuss.
[00:09:11.696 --> 00:09:13.977]  I'm sure all of you saw the news last night.
[00:09:13.997 --> 00:09:22.902]  I only watched a few minutes of television and did see that they were promoting that Ashcroft is out saying, pass my new Patriot Act, pass my Victory Act.
[00:09:23.082 --> 00:09:24.783]  Orrin Hatch is going to introduce it.
[00:09:25.826 --> 00:09:26.947]  It's wonderful.
[00:09:27.427 --> 00:09:29.809]  If you don't do this, terrorists are going to get you.
[00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:34.331]  You've got to pass this legislation to protect liberty now.
[00:09:34.652 --> 00:09:43.297]  It's not give up liberty for security, which Ashcroft has said about 150 times, along with every other bureaucrat in Homeland Security and the Justice Department.
[00:09:43.697 --> 00:09:46.319]  Now it's give up liberty to protect liberty.
[00:09:48.773 --> 00:09:56.319]  And I wanted to read just a sickening editorial by Newsmax, who really has shown their neocon colors.
[00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:01.504]  New fight rages over Patriot Act.
[00:10:02.144 --> 00:10:02.885]  Washington.
[00:10:04.026 --> 00:10:11.672]  President Bush may be poised to wield his veto pen for the first time in his administration.
[00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:20.151]  The controversy goes to the heart of the balance between security and civil liberties in the battle against terrorism.
[00:10:20.171 --> 00:10:20.732]  So there's that.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.582]  False pretext again, that false idea by Wes Vernon.
[00:10:25.103 --> 00:10:27.765]  Hey Wes, every time you give up liberty you get tyranny.
[00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:29.366]  You don't get security.
[00:10:29.506 --> 00:10:30.867]  That's a historical fact.
[00:10:31.247 --> 00:10:32.548]  A five-year-old should know that.
[00:10:33.088 --> 00:10:40.694]  The immediate point at issue is one of several proposals to make a mid-course correction in the Patriot Act.
[00:10:40.754 --> 00:10:43.816]  He says the fight involves, in addition to the left,
[00:10:44.356 --> 00:10:54.301]  Heated internal warfare within the President's constituency, the conservative movement consists of libertarians and the security-minded.
[00:10:54.882 --> 00:11:03.506]  Some who value both are troubled by a feeling they must make a decision not unlike choosing between one's mother and one's father.
[00:11:04.927 --> 00:11:08.569]  Others continue as the Patriot Act presents no such dilemma.
[00:11:11.156 --> 00:11:13.398]  And it goes into this.
[00:11:13.758 --> 00:11:28.208]  Approved by a vote of 309 to 118 majority in late July, the measure prohibits enforcement of the Patriot Act's provision that authorizes the government to conduct a criminal investigation without notifying the suspect that the property has been searched.
[00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:37.595]  And they go on to attack the conservatives that have gotten this repealed in the House.
[00:11:37.635 --> 00:11:40.017]  Of course, it'll go nowhere in the New World Order Senate.
[00:11:41.425 --> 00:11:43.906]  The article goes on and on, but I mean, you heard it.
[00:11:43.926 --> 00:11:46.087]  This is Wes Vernon Newsmax.
[00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:48.368]  We're going to post this on Infowars.com.
[00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:57.791]  Now, understand, they've written articles in Newsmax about, oh, why has Bush signed on to UNESCO?
[00:11:57.852 --> 00:12:01.433]  Why UNESCO says its job is to destroy the family.
[00:12:01.713 --> 00:12:04.174]  Here's a quote where they call the family a disease.
[00:12:04.554 --> 00:12:06.455]  He must not have known what he was doing.
[00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:09.966]  And they make excuses.
[00:12:10.026 --> 00:12:12.889]  Well, Bush is for open borders, but he doesn't mean enter.
[00:12:13.229 --> 00:12:17.294]  Well, he has said he'll sign the assault weapons ban, but he's got to compromise.
[00:12:18.507 --> 00:12:24.489]  Well, he did sign campaign finance reform restricting the First Amendment, but again, he's got to work with the Democrats.
[00:12:24.529 --> 00:12:31.971]  Well, he did give some supercomputers to China, a lot more than Clinton did, but, you know, he's got bad advisors.
[00:12:32.031 --> 00:12:39.373]  Well, he is against arming all the pilots and Barbara Boxer's for it, but, you know, she's just playing politics.
[00:12:39.953 --> 00:12:47.795]  Well, Arnold Schwarzenegger is for abortion and gun control, but we're supporting him and selling lots of garbage with his face on it.
[00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:54.042]  And you see this from WorldNet, Daily News, Max, all these groups.
[00:12:56.365 --> 00:13:08.417]  And they're out there just selling to the neocons, the mindless, happy-go-lucky listeners of Sean Hannity and Limbaugh that don't know we're losing everything, that don't know America's being totally destroyed right now.
[00:13:10.276 --> 00:13:26.527]  They don't understand what George Bush is that didn't hear Ron Paul's speech, where Bush's cabinet says it's about world government, says it's about big government, says it's about socialism, says it's about taking your rights, where they say they're for abortion, where they say they're for Machiavellian politics.
[00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:30.490]  They don't have a clue!
[00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.531]  They don't have a clue!
[00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:33.392]  They don't know!
[00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:36.732]  I talked to some of the folks off air yesterday.
[00:13:36.772 --> 00:13:40.075]  We talked to some of them on air, but I talked to some of them off air and read some of the news articles.
[00:13:40.876 --> 00:13:46.960]  You'd have 500 people in Boise or in Salt Lake City that seem to be about the average size of the crowd or in St.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.105]  Louis or in, you know, wherever Ashcroft shows up, crowds show up over the last few months to protest him.
[00:13:54.489 --> 00:14:01.273]  And the news will focus on one guy in a suit walking up to other conservatives, you know, with his McDonald's cup in his hand.
[00:14:01.293 --> 00:14:05.035]  There's a great photo of this on the Associated Press website, photo website.
[00:14:06.055 --> 00:14:12.779]  Sticking his finger in the face of people with his eyes closed, with his mouth open, just ordering people around, calling them liberals.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.642]  You know, Billy Bob calls the local Patriot group liberals.
[00:14:20.363 --> 00:14:21.424]  You're a liberal!
[00:14:22.219 --> 00:14:23.780]  You're not for gun control!
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.901]  You're a liberal!
[00:14:24.921 --> 00:14:27.562]  So it's all about labels.
[00:14:27.622 --> 00:14:31.304]  The same liberals that wouldn't wake up when we exposed Bill Clinton as being a traitor.
[00:14:31.324 --> 00:14:33.185]  They go, Shut up, right-winger!
[00:14:33.325 --> 00:14:33.925]  Shut up!
[00:14:34.345 --> 00:14:36.347]  We just know you're jealous of Bill Clinton!
[00:14:36.727 --> 00:14:37.947]  Here with those Republicans!
[00:14:38.408 --> 00:14:40.008]  Well, the Republicans are the same way.
[00:14:40.209 --> 00:14:44.071]  I don't care if he wants my guns or is for an open border!
[00:14:44.431 --> 00:14:45.511]  You're a liberal!
[00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:46.512]  Shut up!
[00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.552]  So, you're going to get everything taken from me.
[00:14:51.632 --> 00:15:02.541]  Your pension funds, your economy, your children's futures, your guns, your sovereignty, your borders, your liberties, your Bill of Rights, the bedrock of America, the Ten Commandments.
[00:15:03.982 --> 00:15:04.863]  You're going to lose it all.
[00:15:05.423 --> 00:15:06.924]  But I mean, look at this article.
[00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:11.628]  Wes Vernon.
[00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:15.071]  Amazing.
[00:15:17.502 --> 00:15:19.144]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:15:19.644 --> 00:15:27.051]  Oh, conservatives are pulled between the Constitution and Bush like their mother and their father.
[00:15:28.031 --> 00:15:32.916]  They just love Bush so much and, you know, they're security-minded.
[00:15:32.956 --> 00:15:34.937]  A lot of us are security-minded.
[00:15:35.278 --> 00:15:37.660]  We understand we need to trade off liberty for security.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.101]  Actually says that.
[00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:48.126]  And of course, they'll be brought back into the mind control by Janet, the butcher of Waco, Reno, coming out.
[00:15:48.586 --> 00:15:51.067]  You've got to read her comments in the Miami Herald carefully.
[00:15:53.067 --> 00:16:03.891]  Because she says, well, I'm criticizing Ashcroft, but not because she's not criticizing Ashcroft for the Patriot Act.
[00:16:04.152 --> 00:16:05.272]  She makes that very clear.
[00:16:06.818 --> 00:16:09.581]  She's criticizing Ashcroft for going on this road show.
[00:16:09.922 --> 00:16:11.423]  She says, I didn't do that.
[00:16:13.045 --> 00:16:14.247]  I didn't care what people said.
[00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:15.228]  Oh, we know you didn't.
[00:16:15.528 --> 00:16:17.971]  We know people, you don't care what people think of you.
[00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:22.716]  When you're found in the back of cars with underage girls vomiting, with vomit all over you.
[00:16:22.937 --> 00:16:24.899]  You're so drunk and hopped up on pills.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.201]  That was in the papers in the 80s.
[00:16:28.234 --> 00:16:28.694]  We know.
[00:16:29.735 --> 00:16:30.755]  You don't care, Reno.
[00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:33.196]  So they bring her out and you're going to hear neocons all day.
[00:16:33.656 --> 00:16:33.996]  See?
[00:16:34.096 --> 00:16:35.117]  Reno's against it!
[00:16:35.197 --> 00:16:35.477]  See?
[00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:35.957]  Reno!
[00:16:36.017 --> 00:16:36.277]  Reno!
[00:16:36.617 --> 00:16:37.718]  Oh, Reno's against it!
[00:16:37.778 --> 00:16:38.098]  Reno!
[00:16:38.138 --> 00:16:40.159]  I mean, it's totally staged, folks.
[00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:43.660]  Can't you figure out how this scam works?
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.101]  Chuck in Texas.
[00:16:45.121 --> 00:16:45.881]  Go ahead, Chuck.
[00:16:46.541 --> 00:16:46.721]  Hi.
[00:16:46.801 --> 00:16:47.421]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:16:48.182 --> 00:16:53.904]  I noticed we had our Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld down here in San Antonio.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:04.246]  I think it was this morning, and he was out at Laughlin, which is a closed base, and once again, they want to have complete control of the crowd.
[00:17:05.026 --> 00:17:18.935]  That way, you know, if anybody speaks up, they can be court-martialed and be taken care of, just like, you know, what happened yesterday, where we were listening to the deal with Ashcroft.
[00:17:20.916 --> 00:17:24.058]  And the police were shoving folks around, getting in their face.
[00:17:25.038 --> 00:17:26.059]  Uh, the entire time.
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.760]  They're in Salt Lake.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.761]  Is that what you're talking about?
[00:17:29.001 --> 00:17:29.262]  Uh-huh.
[00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:30.142]  Exactly.
[00:17:30.162 --> 00:17:31.223]  Let me give you an example.
[00:17:32.044 --> 00:17:40.190]  In my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, 2 minutes of the 2 hours and 40 minutes is where Bush had me kidnapped.
[00:17:42.032 --> 00:17:45.335]  And it was in 1998, DuPont photo masking plant.
[00:17:45.715 --> 00:17:47.616]  He was running for governor, again.
[00:17:47.636 --> 00:17:50.519]  And I just said governor at the end of his speech.
[00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:56.409]  I said, Governor, what about the Council on Foreign Relations and the Federal Reserve?
[00:17:56.449 --> 00:17:58.049]  Isn't that what's destroying America, Governor?
[00:17:58.890 --> 00:17:59.070]  Yes.
[00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:02.452]  And he looked at the police.
[00:18:02.492 --> 00:18:07.895]  They ran over, grabbed me, almost broke my arm, drug me out, drove me around for 45 minutes.
[00:18:08.155 --> 00:18:10.536]  Then they radioed him and said, go to cell phone.
[00:18:10.576 --> 00:18:12.517]  And they said, well, they say throw you out on the road.
[00:18:12.537 --> 00:18:15.019]  So they had me thrown out on the side.
[00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:18.741]  They did it to Alan Keyes as well.
[00:18:18.761 --> 00:18:21.282]  Remember when he tried to get into the debate?
[00:18:22.413 --> 00:18:29.674]  And, uh, he was listed in the TV Guide on the News at the debate, but Republicans and Democrats just told cops, hey, uh, arrest him.
[00:18:30.054 --> 00:18:39.016]  They drove him to a crack, uh, park, literally, folks, the most dangerous area of that city, threw him out an hour away from his car on the side of the road.
[00:18:40.136 --> 00:18:51.378]  So, that's your new America, where they have staged meetings with staged government employees in plain clothes, with cops and troops behind them, and then they say on the news, look at the town hall.
[00:18:52.728 --> 00:19:05.771]  Well, they're able to ask questions, but I'm sure they know what the questions are, and your career can take a real bad turn for the worse if you don't ask the right question that you're supposed to ask.
[00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:22.155]  Well, I mean, everybody knows that when you get government bureaucrats and cops in a, you know, they sneak Ashcroft into a hotel, he has a meeting for an hour, a photo op leaves, this is all, they've admitted that they ordered police to stand behind him and salute.
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:29.705]  A memo went out that when he comes to your town, you have the bureaucrats in there, that's all who's allowed to be there.
[00:19:30.245 --> 00:19:44.116]  But look, I've got like ten articles today where it says a lot of troops have died, more than, you know, died during the war, since the end of major military operations, and everywhere that's been changed, Bush said, military operations.
[00:19:45.056 --> 00:19:46.617]  And we have a link on PrisonPlanet.com
[00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:58.605]  Chuck, where it shows where the White House websites everywhere has changed it from military operations to major military operations, this shows incredible control.
[00:19:59.946 --> 00:20:03.267]  And I hope people realize this means we're not going into freedom.
[00:20:03.667 --> 00:20:04.548]  Anything else, Chuck?
[00:20:04.708 --> 00:20:08.790]  Just that I love the show and it's the only place we can get through.
[00:20:10.922 --> 00:20:11.943]  What would you rather do?

[00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:20.766]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:21.607]  We listened.
[00:21:21.907 --> 00:21:26.893]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:27.173 --> 00:21:27.654]  We listened.
[00:21:28.034 --> 00:21:31.098]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:31.518 --> 00:21:32.019]  We listened.
[00:21:32.479 --> 00:21:36.563]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:21:36.923 --> 00:21:37.424]  We listened.
[00:21:37.764 --> 00:21:43.008]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:44.770]  Again, we listened.
[00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:52.536]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:27.900]  All right, folks.

[00:24:32.728 --> 00:24:41.282]  We've got Colonel Craig Roberts joining us in the next hour to talk about world events and give us his unique perspective on that.
[00:24:42.253 --> 00:24:44.415]  Let me go ahead and launch into some of the other news.
[00:24:44.435 --> 00:24:48.638]  I already mentioned this earlier, but it's important to focus a little bit more on it.
[00:24:49.138 --> 00:24:52.321]  Deficit could top $500 billion in 2004.
[00:24:52.961 --> 00:24:57.225]  This is out of MSNBC pessimistic analysis.
[00:24:57.845 --> 00:25:13.145]  From Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Budget Office Tuesday forecast a federal budget deficit of $480 billion, you know, for a record shortfall that many in Congress say could go even higher, posing problems for President Bush as he seeks re-election.
[00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:28.197]  Folks, major economists at major universities a few months ago came out with the numbers, it was in the Dallas Morning News and other publications, that we have a 43 trillion dollar, trillion dollar debt.
[00:25:28.217 --> 00:25:28.197]  43!
[00:25:29.878 --> 00:25:34.880]  Now, I remember Patriots coming up with the numbers 10 years ago that it was 30 plus trillion.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.141]  So obviously 10 years later it's 43 trillion.
[00:25:38.833 --> 00:25:44.518]  American Free Press has been reporting on these numbers for years, says it's actually 70 plus trillion.
[00:25:45.038 --> 00:25:50.983]  But 43 trillion, 70 trillion... I mean, it's hard to get a grasp on these numbers.
[00:25:51.023 --> 00:25:54.346]  It's like saying Adolf Hitler killed 20 million people.
[00:25:54.366 --> 00:25:56.568]  It's hard to get a grasp on that number.
[00:25:57.208 --> 00:26:00.091]  Or Stalin killed 50 million people.
[00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:02.132]  It's hard to grasp that.
[00:26:02.793 --> 00:26:04.294]  Or Mao killed 50 million.
[00:26:06.278 --> 00:26:07.959]  So, like, it's the same way with the numbers.
[00:26:08.039 --> 00:26:11.202]  You know, 43 trillion, 70 trillion, and then they got articles.
[00:26:12.342 --> 00:26:13.383]  500 billion.
[00:26:13.423 --> 00:26:20.288]  Folks, we've got over a hundred billion dollar trade deficit every year now with China alone, okay?
[00:26:20.968 --> 00:26:22.029]  On all the bobble.
[00:26:22.329 --> 00:26:25.592]  This is serious, serious business.
[00:26:27.093 --> 00:26:28.594]  It's very interesting.
[00:26:30.015 --> 00:26:31.636]  Here's an article out of the Miami Herald.
[00:26:31.776 --> 00:26:35.699]  Growth at base shows firm stand on military detention.
[00:26:37.839 --> 00:26:40.440]  Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.021]  20 months after it opened as a short-term solution.
[00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:44.701]  Yeah, right.
[00:26:45.162 --> 00:26:55.305]  Early in America's war on terrorism, the much-criticized military detention and interrogation camp is evolving from mesh wire to concrete.
[00:26:56.265 --> 00:26:57.486]  Now notice, it's off U.S.
[00:26:57.546 --> 00:26:57.946]  soil.
[00:26:58.126 --> 00:27:00.367]  You can't get in the waters because of Cuban gunboats.
[00:27:01.527 --> 00:27:03.688]  With our government coexisting with the communists.
[00:27:05.105 --> 00:27:06.386]  There's military guarding it.
[00:27:06.787 --> 00:27:18.535]  And remember, General Rick Baucus, the head of the base, last year, did my film, Masters of Terror, resigned refusing to be part of the torture.
[00:27:19.896 --> 00:27:25.901]  General Rick Baucus resigned refusing to be part of Camp X-Ray.
[00:27:26.902 --> 00:27:28.543]  He said, I will not be part of the torture.
[00:27:29.551 --> 00:27:33.815]  And he gave interviews up in Rhode Island on the radio, it was in the Associated Press, New York Daily News.
[00:27:34.155 --> 00:27:36.958]  You never heard about it again, and they have a new general there who doesn't mind.
[00:27:37.418 --> 00:27:40.121]  The hastily erected Camp Delta for enemy combatants.
[00:27:40.982 --> 00:27:50.130]  Remember Section 802, anyone that engages in actions that are dangerous to human life, that violate federal or state law, any federal or state law, get an enemy combatant designation.
[00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.093]  And now they're saying that marijuana cigarettes is an act of terror.
[00:27:53.673 --> 00:27:55.435]  I have the Victory Act right here in front of me.
[00:27:57.125 --> 00:28:12.889]  The hastily erected Camp Delta enemy combatants will make a significant leap towards permanence with a previously undisclosed fifth phase, the last phase was execution chambers, that will be hard-sided and take a year to build, the Herald has learned.
[00:28:14.375 --> 00:28:28.893]  Workers are also retrofitting a makeshift courtroom in case some of the 660 detainees from 42 countries, most of them suspected Al Qaeda members or Taliban soldiers captured in Afghanistan, are tried before a military commission.
[00:28:30.245 --> 00:28:31.406]  But you saw what happened on 9-1-1!
[00:28:31.446 --> 00:28:32.366]  We're gonna do it now!
[00:28:32.427 --> 00:28:33.287]  We will not forget!
[00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.051]  Well, we won't forget how the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[00:29:02.091 --> 00:29:09.494]  military bases, how the federal government funded them, how most of them are still alive, confirmed on the record, how the government ordered NORAD to stand down.
[00:29:10.974 --> 00:29:13.235]  We won't forget who's in business with the bin Ladens.
[00:29:14.036 --> 00:29:19.498]  We won't forget the facts of how they've used us for a police state while leaving the borders wide open.
[00:29:20.138 --> 00:29:27.161]  We won't forget that now 8,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda were flown out to safety as part of that stage war in Afghanistan.
[00:29:28.803 --> 00:29:31.465]  Out to safety in Pakistan with an order to leave him alone.
[00:29:31.485 --> 00:29:36.769]  And all the colonels and people that have sung the record, they were ordered not to stop Al Qaeda.
[00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:38.730]  Makes me sick.
[00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:40.832]  I support the troops.
[00:29:41.132 --> 00:29:42.553]  Shut up, Mr. Jones.
[00:29:43.153 --> 00:29:43.874]  I know you do.
[00:29:43.914 --> 00:29:48.397]  That's why when they come home and die, you can go to their funerals from the D.U.
[00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:50.518]  And then maybe you can blame it on me.
[00:29:50.538 --> 00:29:55.802]  If they wouldn't have gropped about it, they wouldn't have died from it.
[00:29:55.982 --> 00:29:58.064]  I'm turning my guns in, you liberal.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.787]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.729 --> 00:30:07.415]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.306 --> 00:30:15.947]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first-ever half-price package sale at the AHRQ Institute.
[00:30:16.047 --> 00:30:25.030]  You'll get 25 big packets of AHRQ's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds, plus four of their most-for-my-life are on the web at iNeedBodyBalance.com.
[00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.870]  Life force independent number.
[00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:26.471]  Distribution in the U.S.
[00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:26.791]  market only.
[00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:27.531]  LFI UAC 82174741.
[00:30:27.571 --> 00:30:30.212]  These statements have not been tolerated by the FDA.
[00:30:30.232 --> 00:30:32.272]  These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[00:30:33.733 --> 00:30:36.474]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:30:36.494 --> 00:30:40.355]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:30:58.721 --> 00:31:03.027]  All right, my fellow Imperial Americans.
[00:31:04.207 --> 00:31:07.069]  Give your liberties up to defend your liberties.
[00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:09.811]  That's what it's all about here on the show.
[00:31:09.831 --> 00:31:14.955]  I'm going to jump back into some more news, and we're going to go to Warren in Pennsylvania and others that are patiently holding.
[00:31:14.975 --> 00:31:17.416]  If you want to join us on air, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:31:17.456 --> 00:31:23.121]  And again, I ask the listeners, what do you think of Ashcroft and his whirlwind tour of lives?
[00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:45.537]  Telling you the Patriot Act doesn't take your liberties, doesn't affect citizens, that there was no new Patriot Act, and now saying, OK, it's for all drug crimes and possession and violence or anything.
[00:31:45.798 --> 00:31:46.758]  It's all terror.
[00:31:47.418 --> 00:31:51.180]  And now they're building on the Camp X-Ray.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:57.103]  They admit building an execution area in the Kangaroo Court.
[00:31:58.784 --> 00:31:59.345]  And it says,
[00:32:00.948 --> 00:32:12.971]  That, quote, the development suggests the Bush administration is literally pouring concrete around the controversial policy of indefinitely holding alleged terrorists and supporters in legal limbo without prisoner of war rights.
[00:32:13.051 --> 00:32:13.791]  Yeah, nothing.
[00:32:14.392 --> 00:32:27.075]  This should exist as long as the global war on terrorism is ongoing, if it helps our nation and our allies win, said Camp Commander Major General Jeffrey Miller, who replaced Rick Baucus, the former general who, quote, refused to torture people.
[00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:30.920]  And set on the record, this isn't Taliban or Al-Qaeda at this base.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.900]  No, they all work for the CIA.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.661]  And the LA Times and others admit they just grabbed a bunch of kids off the street and old men.
[00:32:37.681 --> 00:32:39.361]  This is all part of a training demo.
[00:32:39.781 --> 00:32:41.441]  That, oh, see, we've got this camp.
[00:32:42.061 --> 00:32:42.782]  And now U.S.
[00:32:42.802 --> 00:32:44.102]  citizens are there as well.
[00:32:44.202 --> 00:32:49.283]  And, you know, then they'll blow something up and claim that the white boys in the militia did it.
[00:32:49.343 --> 00:32:51.103]  Or the Black Panthers did it.
[00:32:51.163 --> 00:32:57.104]  And see, we can then fill the camp at the base, outside the country where no one can get to it.
[00:32:58.391 --> 00:33:00.733]  It's part of a dictatorship over there.
[00:33:00.753 --> 00:33:02.094]  Isn't that nice?
[00:33:03.415 --> 00:33:08.098]  We are exceptionally good at developing intelligence that will help defeat the scourge of terrorism.
[00:33:08.118 --> 00:33:12.161]  Yes, the scourge that has now been institutionalized.
[00:33:12.281 --> 00:33:19.367]  Homeland Security, biggest federal agency, all the big colleges giving courses in it now, and they say it's going to go on forever.
[00:33:20.328 --> 00:33:24.189]  Ashcroft said, as terrorism evolves, more liberties will have to be relinquished.
[00:33:24.229 --> 00:33:26.770]  It's just gonna grow and grow, like the drugs.
[00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:30.971]  The bigger the drug war gets, the more SWAT teams bust down your door and blow you in half.
[00:33:31.651 --> 00:33:36.872]  The more heroin and cocaine, the more robberies, the more... But that doesn't matter again.
[00:33:37.492 --> 00:33:42.394]  Many legal scholars and human rights groups continue to argue that the policy unnecessarily bends U.S.
[00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:42.674]  law.
[00:33:42.774 --> 00:33:43.734]  Bends it, it breaks it.
[00:33:44.214 --> 00:33:47.155]  Undermines the stability of the Geneva Convention.
[00:33:48.027 --> 00:33:53.628]  What about the Bill of Rights, when instead the existing legal system could be modified to meet intelligence security needs?
[00:33:55.208 --> 00:34:08.291]  But calls to change the approach seem increasingly moot as workers throw up even more durable structures, also including dormitory housing for 2,000 soldiers there, though there's not 2,000 soldiers.
[00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:10.092]  And there's photos of this.
[00:34:10.232 --> 00:34:13.852]  It looks just like Auschwitz, which IBM helped design.
[00:34:15.073 --> 00:34:16.773]  Blue, by the way, is now involved in all this.
[00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:17.669]  We're good.
[00:34:33.055 --> 00:34:39.220]  The contractor is Kellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Vice President Dick Cheney's former company, Texas-based Halliburton.
[00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:49.069]  And by the way, they build the re-education centers at the airport in Baghdad and other areas, and you've got to wear an RFID badge or bracelet to have a job anywhere.
[00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:51.551]  According to the Associated Press, you get $20 a month.
[00:34:52.132 --> 00:34:58.417]  And there are Associated Press articles and photos we posted of hundreds of men being loaded with hoods over their heads in the backs of trucks.
[00:34:58.917 --> 00:35:00.459]  We're selling goods at markets.
[00:35:01.457 --> 00:35:09.504]  Fruits and vegetables and milk and beer, beer too, without a special Halliburton license.
[00:35:09.544 --> 00:35:12.486]  So, Halliburton now owns 21 million people.
[00:35:14.248 --> 00:35:15.529]  But again, that's about freedom!
[00:35:16.149 --> 00:35:17.170]  The liberation!
[00:35:20.553 --> 00:35:21.654]  Wow, isn't that nice?
[00:35:26.714 --> 00:35:31.876]  And the government admits that it is, quote, an interrogation facility, an execution facility.
[00:35:31.956 --> 00:35:34.937]  It is interesting they chose to frame it as an interrogation facility, quote.
[00:35:35.297 --> 00:35:44.160]  Patton said, does it become the camp to house the people who are the subject of a more intensive interrogation or whose cooperation they haven't been able to obtain?
[00:35:45.726 --> 00:35:56.634]  Patton also said the news of the commitment to a level of permanence we haven't seen up until now likely means the analysis of detainee releases has been wrong.
[00:35:56.695 --> 00:36:05.041]  Some commentators have said the military may have decided to draw down the numbers held there, but instead they're building on for 2,000 more.
[00:36:05.061 --> 00:36:12.847]  64 have been released and four transferred to Saudi Arabia for continued detention to Major John Smith, a military spokesman.
[00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:16.670]  Well, isn't that nice?
[00:36:17.151 --> 00:36:19.551]  That is really nice, folks.
[00:36:22.252 --> 00:36:26.873]  And again, they say that these facilities are going to be built all over U.S.
[00:36:26.973 --> 00:36:32.715]  protectorates or possessions or bases, and anyone will be held there for drug possession now.
[00:36:32.735 --> 00:36:41.017]  Drug possession is an act of terror and will be sent to camps, but again, the government's been caught shipping it in and then creating a crisis.
[00:36:41.641 --> 00:36:49.383]  When you're idiot teenagers, dumb enough to start dealing some, they'll be shipped off to a camp and they admit they're going to build factories onto these.
[00:36:50.624 --> 00:36:52.344]  Let's talk to Warren in Pennsylvania.
[00:36:52.384 --> 00:36:53.184]  Warren, you're on the air.
[00:36:53.224 --> 00:36:53.644]  Go ahead.
[00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:54.505]  Hey, Alex.
[00:36:54.585 --> 00:36:55.285]  How are you doing?
[00:36:55.605 --> 00:36:56.745]  Well, I'm doing okay.
[00:36:57.245 --> 00:36:58.286]  Yeah, well, guess what?
[00:36:58.366 --> 00:37:04.528]  Recently, and just in the past year, I noticed that some of the Kmart stores that I shop at... Kmart?
[00:37:04.548 --> 00:37:05.868]  I didn't know they were still around.
[00:37:06.587 --> 00:37:19.276]  Yeah, Kmart's, uh, and, uh, they have these giant, uh, Big Brother TV screens, it looks like to me, big giant screen above the customer service desk, and you can see yourself on it, like a big surveillance thing.
[00:37:19.597 --> 00:37:32.947]  And I was wondering, uh, would it do any good to call up the contact management and say, hey, you know, I object to this, uh, this is, uh, some kind of, uh, you know... That's like asking, you've heard the story of the
[00:37:35.274 --> 00:37:38.137]  A little gazelle who wanted to go across the African River.
[00:37:38.157 --> 00:37:39.018]  Yeah.
[00:37:39.298 --> 00:37:45.203]  And the gazelle came to the crocodile and said, can I ride over on your back and will you promise not to eat me?
[00:37:45.303 --> 00:37:48.046]  And the crocodile said, sure, I promise.
[00:37:48.126 --> 00:37:50.768]  And then halfway over the water, he turned around, grabbed her by the neck.
[00:37:50.828 --> 00:37:54.652]  And as he was pulling her under, she said, why?
[00:37:54.712 --> 00:37:55.973]  You promised you wouldn't do that.
[00:37:56.473 --> 00:37:57.634]  He said, I'm a crocodile.
[00:37:59.742 --> 00:38:02.944]  So, yeah, you can call the government if you want.
[00:38:02.984 --> 00:38:04.845]  That's basically who owns these Fortune 500.
[00:38:05.125 --> 00:38:10.528]  They admittedly have been meeting with Homeland Security to, quote, neutralize opposition to the control grid.
[00:38:11.068 --> 00:38:14.530]  That's a quote of the, quote, Babylon system.
[00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.871]  This has been in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:38:15.911 --> 00:38:17.612]  We broke the story here with Catherine Albrecht.
[00:38:18.912 --> 00:38:21.554]  Some secret group called Babylon controls it.
[00:38:22.354 --> 00:38:23.395]  Some secret code word.
[00:38:23.415 --> 00:38:26.657]  Thanks for the call.
[00:38:26.717 --> 00:38:28.958]  Sounds like your phone's having a problem there.
[00:38:30.115 --> 00:38:44.046]  But Warren, when they show you at Walmart and Target and Kmart and all the rest of it, when they show yourself on surveillance camera, that's in case you haven't consciously realized you're being surveilled.
[00:38:46.908 --> 00:38:52.553]  And that's also to acclimate you, yes, at a higher level to being surveilled.
[00:38:55.715 --> 00:38:57.777]  Now let's go ahead and talk to
[00:38:58.999 --> 00:39:00.080]  Clyde in Colorado.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:00.760]  Go ahead, Clyde.
[00:39:01.621 --> 00:39:02.321]  Hi, Alex.
[00:39:02.341 --> 00:39:03.122]  Thanks for your program.
[00:39:03.462 --> 00:39:03.963]  Well, thank you.
[00:39:04.003 --> 00:39:05.544]  Go ahead.
[00:39:05.964 --> 00:39:21.875]  I did ask, let's say, Home Depot manager last Friday about, did he have any or did he know in the future of any biometric devices and or RFID chips that were going to be in any of his products or currently any of them?
[00:39:21.915 --> 00:39:23.437]  He gave me a very interesting answer.
[00:39:24.277 --> 00:39:25.298]  He said, quote,
[00:39:26.113 --> 00:39:30.294]  If I knew that, I would not be able to tell you.
[00:39:33.475 --> 00:39:37.596]  I just asked an assistant manager at Walmart.
[00:39:37.656 --> 00:39:45.177]  He does not have a clue, including the customer service manager, what they're planning, I guess, for us.
[00:39:45.617 --> 00:39:46.358]  Well, I do.
[00:39:46.378 --> 00:39:47.918]  Yeah, I know you do.
[00:39:48.198 --> 00:39:49.738]  Well, no, I mean, I'm not like, oh, I do.
[00:39:49.778 --> 00:39:51.259]  I'm smart, but let me just tell folks.
[00:39:53.211 --> 00:40:07.438]  There are so many mainstream RFID articles put out by the RFID Journal, which admits that it was founded by the RFID Consortium, is funded almost exclusively by the RFID industry, the Fortune 500, and Homeland Security.
[00:40:07.458 --> 00:40:15.622]  They have said Home Depot, Walmart, Procter & Gamble, Target, I mean it's hundreds of companies, Kraft,
[00:40:16.665 --> 00:40:22.228]  Gillette, Michelin, I mean, we've listed hundreds of them here.
[00:40:22.328 --> 00:40:22.748]  Hundreds.
[00:40:23.048 --> 00:40:23.428]  Yeah, I know.
[00:40:23.948 --> 00:40:36.634]  And the plan is to tear out all cash registers that are, that have a person at them, and so you're not even, this is admitted, sir, this is admitted four years ago, when I learned of it.
[00:40:36.674 --> 00:40:45.798]  Tex Mars wrote a book six years ago called Project Lucent, he wrote it in 95, published it in 96, so six years ago published, called Lucent.
[00:40:46.648 --> 00:40:47.794]  Project Lucent.
[00:40:48.075 --> 00:40:50.709]  By the way, we offer that now at Infowars.com, but the point is...
[00:40:52.492 --> 00:41:19.802]  This is old, and it was publicly announced that, did you see the IBM commercial that ran for a couple years, a few years ago, where the guy looks like he's stealing, he's really cool, he's good looking, he's wearing a leather jacket, he's kind of the icon type, he's cramming goods in his shirt, you think he's stealing, but he's so bold, you know, you marvel at his boldness because we're timid and cowardly, we've been engineered that way, he walks through, good looking girls look at him with desire, my, he's a good little thief,
[00:41:20.442 --> 00:41:23.703]  Then all of a sudden, the security guard runs up and says, sir, sir, sir.
[00:41:24.003 --> 00:41:27.703]  He's walking out the front door, and he turns around calmly, and you go, how dare him?
[00:41:28.183 --> 00:41:28.804]  What arrogance?
[00:41:28.844 --> 00:41:30.464]  And he says, sir, you forgot your receipt.
[00:41:31.404 --> 00:41:32.684]  Now, do you remember that ad?
[00:41:32.704 --> 00:41:35.265]  Um, I don't watch that much television.
[00:41:35.325 --> 00:41:36.305]  Sorry, I didn't see it.
[00:41:36.645 --> 00:41:37.325]  Well, absolutely.
[00:41:38.045 --> 00:41:46.687]  But that's what they're doing there, is in that ad, they are, and it's just, IBM just pays for it.
[00:41:46.707 --> 00:41:47.807]  They're not selling anything.
[00:41:48.924 --> 00:41:50.065]  And he's just being scanned.
[00:41:50.085 --> 00:41:50.785]  Well, they say.
[00:41:51.326 --> 00:41:52.026]  That's the point.
[00:41:52.046 --> 00:41:54.688]  You're not going to have to weigh your vegetables or load your stuff in.
[00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:58.110]  Safeway announced it in the Sacramento Bee a few months ago.
[00:41:58.170 --> 00:41:58.830]  It was a big article.
[00:42:00.652 --> 00:42:05.274]  Everywhere you go, you just simply walk through.
[00:42:05.294 --> 00:42:07.636]  You just leave with the basket.
[00:42:08.877 --> 00:42:09.217]  Okay?
[00:42:09.357 --> 00:42:10.978]  And everything is scanned and collated.
[00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:17.054]  Well, it seems to me we need to put in some time to think about how we can get around it, if we can.
[00:42:17.414 --> 00:42:18.615]  That's what it seems to me to be.
[00:42:19.315 --> 00:42:20.556]  Well, I'll tell you how to get around it.
[00:42:21.497 --> 00:42:24.479]  You've got to boycott, you've got to protest, you've got to get involved now.
[00:42:24.519 --> 00:42:31.344]  Because once all the stores put it in, they're already cracking down on farmers' markets, under Homeland Security.
[00:42:31.424 --> 00:42:32.645]  I've seen Ridge say it.
[00:42:33.206 --> 00:42:34.947]  They're going to ban farmers' markets.
[00:42:35.954 --> 00:42:51.456]  Uh, that is, you'll have to go through, weigh your stuff, there'll be a government bureaucrat there with an added tax to pay for them to be there, and then everything will have to be put through, uh, their scales, their systems, quote, so a terrorist doesn't attack us through the food supply.
[00:42:51.963 --> 00:43:02.067]  You'll have to have a special ID card to have a job anywhere connected to food, ranching, farming, in restaurants, in grocery stores, and of course transportation, you'll have to have it, that's already started.
[00:43:03.207 --> 00:43:09.869]  The entire factories, oh that's key infrastructure, bridges, government jobs, any job.
[00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.351]  Well Alex, it makes me wonder when they're going to ban even having home gardens.
[00:43:14.471 --> 00:43:16.051]  I've wondered about that for a lot of years.
[00:43:16.612 --> 00:43:17.732]  Portland has done that.
[00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:20.303]  Of course it's a liberal bastion.
[00:43:20.703 --> 00:43:21.963]  You have to get a special permit.
[00:43:22.003 --> 00:43:23.563]  It has to be very small.
[00:43:23.984 --> 00:43:25.504]  They're limiting the size.
[00:43:27.164 --> 00:43:30.285]  You think, how long are we away from them trying to starve us to death?
[00:43:30.405 --> 00:43:32.946]  I think that's probably one thing in the future.
[00:43:33.126 --> 00:43:36.607]  They have to get about 90% of us or more into the cities.
[00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:38.168]  They're at about 85% right now.
[00:43:39.978 --> 00:43:40.378]  I think so.
[00:43:58.610 --> 00:43:59.051]  I think?
[00:44:12.719 --> 00:44:13.459]  We're good to go.
[00:44:36.232 --> 00:44:43.256]  Well, while they're killing the third world and the mass attacks will begin in the major cities and the extermination programs there and that's what we're facing.
[00:44:43.536 --> 00:44:49.140]  Well, are there any other ministries besides End Times that are kind of following what's going on or trying to alert people to?
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:45:00.706]  I've wondered about, you know, because there just is no information available from certainly not local churches and I haven't heard a single word on any of the national ministries.
[00:45:02.386 --> 00:45:03.326]  They're pretty much shot.
[00:45:03.347 --> 00:45:04.227]  Most of them are.
[00:45:04.407 --> 00:45:05.067]  Take the chip.
[00:45:05.127 --> 00:45:06.328]  It's a Christian thing to do.
[00:45:06.428 --> 00:45:07.489]  It's not the mark of the beast.
[00:45:07.909 --> 00:45:09.970]  George Bush is directed by Jesus.
[00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:11.210]  I mean, I've actually heard them say this.
[00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:12.811]  Yep.
[00:45:13.031 --> 00:45:15.833]  Now there's going to be a world leader who will arise in Israel.
[00:45:16.393 --> 00:45:18.414]  We're going to need to worship him in the temple.
[00:45:19.435 --> 00:45:20.855]  This is the new Christian way.
[00:45:21.275 --> 00:45:22.916]  You must support Israel no matter what it does.
[00:45:22.936 --> 00:45:25.298]  And there's going to be a leader there who we must follow.
[00:45:25.738 --> 00:45:27.158]  And the chips, by the way, aren't bad.
[00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:30.680]  I mean, actually, this is the new neocon Christian church.
[00:45:31.561 --> 00:45:32.101]  Pretty good.
[00:45:33.303 --> 00:45:36.005]  Well, that's how even the elect would be deceived.
[00:45:36.085 --> 00:45:36.945]  Yep, absolutely.
[00:45:37.365 --> 00:45:42.428]  And they'll call for you to be killed in a concentration camp because you don't worship Jesus when he returns.
[00:45:42.748 --> 00:45:50.032]  See, the Antichrist is going to be Jesus, and they're going to bow down to him, and then these Christians, that's who's going to be leading you to the guillotines.
[00:45:50.552 --> 00:45:55.695]  Well, you know, I think sometimes... Knowing the global leader loves Jesus and Buddha, cut his head off for Jesus!
[00:45:55.935 --> 00:46:00.898]  You know, I think in my experience with dealing with Christians and non-Christians, and even a few atheists,
[00:46:02.498 --> 00:46:08.301]  I've had more trouble talking to Christians about anything about what's going on.
[00:46:08.321 --> 00:46:11.243]  Well, they're really Satanists, that's why.
[00:46:11.303 --> 00:46:15.085]  Well, I think there's great deception and denial, I think.
[00:46:15.285 --> 00:46:18.887]  I mean, the ultimate slave of Lucifer doesn't even know they're a slave.
[00:46:19.107 --> 00:46:24.090]  But that's absolutely true, and there's nothing sadder than somebody who's a slave who thinks they're free.
[00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:30.193]  And that's, of course, the situation we have in America, because we've contracted away, as you know, basically all of our rights.
[00:46:30.749 --> 00:46:33.290]  Absolutely, thanks for the call.
[00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:34.530]  Great, great points.
[00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:36.951]  Appreciate it, Clyde.
[00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:39.132]  Let me just say this.
[00:46:39.152 --> 00:46:41.633]  You know, people just tune in, they're like, this guy's nuts.
[00:46:41.933 --> 00:46:54.578]  In my film Road to Tyranny, I have the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, the big papers in Australia, declassified government plan to sterilize and kill people with race-specific viruses and bacteria.
[00:46:56.247 --> 00:46:58.848]  Jane's Weapons Dictionary admits they have this.
[00:46:59.069 --> 00:47:01.029]  Israel, the U.S., and the U.K.
[00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:11.795]  We have Henry Kissinger's signature on a CIA plan in 1973 to order the third world, this was transmitted officially and carried out, to sterilize after women forcibly.
[00:47:12.815 --> 00:47:19.298]  The official globalist statements by the Ted Turners, the Jacques Cousteau's, the Prince Phillips, are they want to kill 95 to 80 percent of us.
[00:47:19.638 --> 00:47:24.581]  These are in published books, you know, like if I was an animal by Prince Philip, His Royal Highness.
[00:47:25.718 --> 00:47:26.819]  Uh, this is the plan.
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.602]  Okay, I sit around and read hundred page documents.
[00:47:30.122 --> 00:47:31.363]  We post them on the website.
[00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:39.230]  And when I tell you the Victory Act says if you got one marijuana cigarette you can get put in a concentration camp, it actually says that, folks.
[00:47:39.551 --> 00:47:44.135]  It says all terrorism clauses apply for any possession of drugs of any type.
[00:47:45.493 --> 00:47:52.397]  Of controlled substances, including your prescriptions that weren't in the bottle that you just took in your lunch box in your little pill case.
[00:47:52.778 --> 00:47:53.478]  You disappear.
[00:47:53.718 --> 00:47:54.559]  You're never seen again.
[00:47:54.599 --> 00:47:55.479]  You don't get a trial.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.680]  You don't get a jury.
[00:47:58.401 --> 00:48:01.263]  The globalists want the live extension technologies for themselves.
[00:48:01.303 --> 00:48:10.889]  So if you want to stop the control grid being put in, when you see them pull out four or five of the checkout lanes and put out self-serve,
[00:48:11.733 --> 00:48:17.918]  You've got to understand, the admitted plan is to then tear out all the checkout lanes and make you check yourself out.
[00:48:18.358 --> 00:48:19.799]  Then they put thumb scanners in.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:28.626]  They're now at grocery stores in Texas and New York and Kansas and all over in California putting in the thumb scanners at the self-serve systems.
[00:48:28.967 --> 00:48:30.708]  It's an admitted plan, folks.
[00:48:32.296 --> 00:48:34.277]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:48:34.357 --> 00:48:45.081]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:48:45.441 --> 00:48:49.983]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:48:50.043 --> 00:49:01.367]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:49:01.967 --> 00:49:08.810]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.351]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:49:11.831 --> 00:49:16.814]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[00:49:17.114 --> 00:49:23.256]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-8000.
[00:49:32.343 --> 00:49:33.344]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[00:49:33.584 --> 00:49:35.906]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:36.706]  You heard that right.
[00:49:36.786 --> 00:49:39.268]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:49:39.408 --> 00:49:40.349]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:41.910]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:49:42.151 --> 00:49:43.732]  Now is the time to fight back.
[00:49:43.952 --> 00:49:46.714]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[00:49:46.894 --> 00:49:47.775]  The procedure's easy.
[00:49:48.075 --> 00:49:50.577]  And everything is done legally and within the law.
[00:49:50.777 --> 00:49:52.177]  Almost no one has ever failed.

[00:50:02.483 --> 00:50:05.065]  It's done by an outside source found on our website.
[00:50:05.245 --> 00:50:09.667]  Believe it or not, mortgage debt elimination has been done for thousands for more than 10 years.
[00:50:09.848 --> 00:50:11.248]  Don't let the banksters cheat you.
[00:50:11.529 --> 00:50:12.409]  Fight back America.
[00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:13.350]  Stop the fraud.
[00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:14.350]  Stop the rip-off.

[00:50:32.265 --> 00:50:39.090]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.791]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:50:40.991 --> 00:50:43.192]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:50:43.352 --> 00:50:45.434]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:50:45.714 --> 00:50:50.637]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11, this is the film for you.
[00:50:50.977 --> 00:50:54.940]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.042]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:50:57.122 --> 00:51:07.771]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:07.911 --> 00:51:09.813]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:10.013 --> 00:51:13.856]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.
[00:51:13.976 --> 00:51:15.418]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:15.458 --> 00:51:15.638]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:23.104 --> 00:51:25.845]  There's just a couple things holding back the globalists right now.
[00:51:25.865 --> 00:51:26.545]  Just a couple things.
[00:51:53.078 --> 00:52:02.268]  Number one, they don't have enough evil people to serve them, or enough useful idiots who believe in the cause of evil and think they're good.
[00:52:02.288 --> 00:52:08.935]  I mean, they don't have enough personnel that are willing to torture some Afghan 15-year-old kid to death.
[00:52:09.896 --> 00:52:12.599]  They don't have enough doctors who are willing to do the
[00:52:14.458 --> 00:52:29.684]  The sophisticated suffocation system they have where they paralyze you from the neck down with drugs and then burn your heart and lungs off when you don't answer the questions properly with an MRI hooked up to your brain that supposedly detects if you're lying or not.
[00:52:30.985 --> 00:52:43.069]  And see, that's why they take thousands of people who are totally innocent to different camps in Jordan, and in Egypt, and in Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, and then to Camp X-Ray.
[00:52:43.469 --> 00:52:45.810]  And that's why they have the troops carry out the torture.
[00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:58.054]  Putting a hood over somebody's head, hanging them by their arms for a day or two, off and on, not feeding them, having them in cages for two years with mosquitoes biting them, and rats all over them.
[00:52:58.354 --> 00:53:00.175]  Stuff the Vietnamese did to our troops.
[00:53:01.135 --> 00:53:03.157]  And our troops now just think, well, this isn't torture.
[00:53:04.018 --> 00:53:12.425]  The base commander said it's not torture to tie somebody up with their legs up under their knees for two days, which is, by the way, one of the worst forms of torture.
[00:53:12.825 --> 00:53:15.187]  It's an Asian form of torture.
[00:53:17.648 --> 00:53:19.489]  But, you know, they just think it's normal.
[00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:24.930]  Of course, General Rick Baucus, Brigadier General, he understood what torture was and said, I'm not going to be part of this.
[00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:28.711]  By the way, these guys aren't even real Taliban or Al Qaeda, is what he said when he resigned.
[00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:31.011]  But they got a guy now who doesn't think it's torture.
[00:53:31.371 --> 00:53:32.951]  So see, it's all labeling things.
[00:53:33.292 --> 00:53:39.473]  Well, yeah, we torture people, but we're going to visit with them, Rumsfeld says.
[00:53:39.573 --> 00:53:40.653]  We're going to put some pressure.
[00:53:40.673 --> 00:53:41.853]  We're going to interrogate them.
[00:53:42.354 --> 00:53:44.234]  And yeah, we put some pressure on them.
[00:53:45.754 --> 00:53:47.736]  But just enough to keep America safe.
[00:53:47.796 --> 00:53:49.757]  See, it's the mass warping of the mind.
[00:53:50.078 --> 00:53:56.903]  And so you go into the grocery store, you go into the bank, you go into wherever, and notice there's less and less tellers, less and less checkout people.
[00:53:58.284 --> 00:54:02.408]  And you notice there's big lines at the Home Depot or at the Walmart.
[00:54:03.649 --> 00:54:04.570]  People want service.
[00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:06.451]  They want to talk to somebody at the checkout line.
[00:54:06.871 --> 00:54:14.618]  Plus, they instinctively understand it by going to the checkout line that has a person that keeps the economy going by having an individual there having a job.
[00:54:17.037 --> 00:54:19.699]  But it isn't about... it's about not needing you now.
[00:54:19.779 --> 00:54:30.488]  It's about getting you out of the factories, getting you off the farms, getting you dependent on government to go work in government jobs or to have government money simply put on a card.
[00:54:31.729 --> 00:54:33.410]  See, the globalists control the resources.
[00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:35.311]  Now they just want to control you.
[00:54:36.252 --> 00:54:38.194]  And so, you better boycott.
[00:54:38.234 --> 00:54:39.214]  You better protest.
[00:54:39.294 --> 00:54:42.457]  They may not have the big selection in that little hardware store.
[00:54:42.797 --> 00:54:44.999]  You better go there and pay more.
[00:54:45.965 --> 00:54:47.346]  Instead of going to Home Depot.
[00:54:49.028 --> 00:54:49.388]  Okay?
[00:54:49.889 --> 00:54:52.611]  Because, folks, you're slitting your own throat.
[00:54:52.731 --> 00:54:54.653]  You better write Home Depot and tell them.
[00:54:55.554 --> 00:54:58.677]  I'm not going to go to your store because you're putting in automatic checkout lanes.
[00:54:58.957 --> 00:55:01.980]  And because I've read the plans to put in thumb scanners with those.
[00:55:05.463 --> 00:55:06.564]  It's so scary.
[00:55:06.624 --> 00:55:07.705]  It's all about control.
[00:55:07.765 --> 00:55:11.028]  Before I end this hour and come back and talk to Eric and others, and we'll go to Colonel Craig Roberts,
[00:55:12.771 --> 00:55:19.874]  I want everybody to get the new book we've published, written by Paul Watson, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror and the New World Order.
[00:55:19.894 --> 00:55:22.295]  It's an excellent book covering government-sponsored terror.
[00:55:23.176 --> 00:55:24.436]  With the newest revelations, $19.95.
[00:55:25.817 --> 00:55:28.678]  Get a second copy as a gift for friends or family for only $12.
[00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:31.540]  Second copy's over a third off, $8 off.
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:44.386]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, my best film, my newest film that's excellent as well, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.

[00:56:01.649 --> 00:56:03.932]  Again, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:56:03.972 --> 00:56:04.793]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:22.714 --> 00:56:40.290]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available in... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.899 --> 00:56:48.540]  Big Brother.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.241]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.961 --> 00:56:52.142]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.722 --> 00:56:53.543]  You want answers?
[00:56:54.303 --> 00:56:56.225]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:56.245 --> 00:56:59.607]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:00.047 --> 00:57:04.190]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:06.972 --> 00:57:12.936]  Mars is the closest it's going to be to Earth in 60,000 years, they say.
[00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:16.819]  Tonight, tomorrow night,
[00:57:18.639 --> 00:57:19.160]  Amazing.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.081]  I'm going to try to get out with the binoculars.
[00:57:21.922 --> 00:57:26.265]  My dad with the telescope tonight has been kind of cloudy the last few days.
[00:57:26.285 --> 00:57:28.147]  I haven't been able to do it, but that's something you might want to do.
[00:57:28.207 --> 00:57:29.768]  Just a side issue, kind of interesting.
[00:57:30.448 --> 00:57:33.090]  It certainly is a lot bigger than I've ever seen it in my short life.
[00:57:33.191 --> 00:57:37.374]  It looks like it's a lot bigger than Jupiter appears normally.
[00:57:37.574 --> 00:57:40.396]  Normally Mars is a tiny red dot or pink dot.
[00:57:41.297 --> 00:57:44.579]  Just as an interesting side note, I was looking at my atomic clock and it said 826.
[00:57:47.771 --> 00:57:52.473]  And I was thinking, wow, interesting little tidbit.
[00:57:52.813 --> 00:58:00.196]  Colonel Craig Roberts is coming up here in about five minutes, and I really am going to throw news articles out at him and get his response and his take on him.
[00:58:01.017 --> 00:58:02.997]  Right now, let's go to Eric in Connecticut.
[00:58:03.057 --> 00:58:03.718]  Eric, go ahead.
[00:58:03.738 --> 00:58:05.118]  Hello, Alex.
[00:58:05.839 --> 00:58:06.179]  Welcome.
[00:58:06.759 --> 00:58:07.539]  Great show, as always.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:13.842]  You know, I was listening over the weekend to Matt Drudge, Sunday night, and he was actually talking about
[00:58:14.693 --> 00:58:17.295]  The RFID tracker chips in the cars in England.
[00:58:17.375 --> 00:58:23.380]  And I thought to myself, wow, it's actually interesting that a neocon is finally coming to the party, albeit very late.
[00:58:24.361 --> 00:58:26.382]  But I wanted to actually make a request.
[00:58:26.783 --> 00:58:36.030]  You have mentioned earlier that you were in the line for a contract for a very lucrative amount of money if you would give up the crusade.
[00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:43.876]  And there are a lot of listeners out there, myself included, who basically thought guys like Limbaugh and Hannity and these other people
[00:58:44.315 --> 00:58:45.135]  We're the bee's knees.
[00:58:45.736 --> 00:58:49.178]  And I mean, I hungrily listened to Limbaugh for years and years and years.
[00:58:49.818 --> 00:58:52.059]  And finally, September 11th happened.
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:55.841]  And I saw your video, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:58:56.221 --> 00:59:01.184]  And I have to be honest, when I first saw it, I kind of thought, hmm, a lot of this stuff's a little off the beam.
[00:59:01.224 --> 00:59:02.305]  But then I researched it.
[00:59:02.425 --> 00:59:03.105]  I looked into it.
[00:59:03.545 --> 00:59:04.906]  And guess what, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:59:05.306 --> 00:59:06.447]  Alex is telling the truth.
[00:59:07.047 --> 00:59:09.969]  It may be hard to believe at first, but he's telling the truth.
[00:59:10.689 --> 00:59:13.671]  Yet his other video, The Masters of Terror,
[00:59:14.744 --> 00:59:15.967]  He's telling the truth.
[00:59:16.668 --> 00:59:22.039]  And I just wonder, Alex, these guys like Limbaugh and Hannity, I mean, do they believe the stuff they're actually shoveling?
[00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:25.265]  The answer is an unequivocal no.
[00:59:26.528 --> 00:59:30.871]  They know exactly, at that level, they are told what to say.
[00:59:31.452 --> 00:59:34.554]  They are given directions to go.
[00:59:34.954 --> 00:59:41.599]  Limbaugh's so trusted as a neocon Judas goat that he's left alone probably.
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:45.321]  But he goes to all the top globalist meetings and is in with them.
[00:59:45.822 --> 00:59:53.247]  A Hannity or the ilk, look sir, I mean it's come out that
[00:59:53.866 --> 00:59:56.348]  It's come out the talk show hosts get orders.
[00:59:57.169 --> 01:00:03.916]  I've talked to a lot of other talk show hosts that just stay where they're at and are being threatened to be fired because they're not worshipping the New World Order.
[01:00:04.256 --> 01:00:16.748]  They've got a few token people, but I mean, folks want me to, you know, these meetings I had now five years ago, five years ago, and you know, I've talked to other groups too, and they've always approached to me.
[01:00:18.726 --> 01:00:32.309]  I mean, I told them it was in confidence, and I had to even go into these discussions, had to sign non-disclosure agreements, and frankly, I wouldn't talk about it even if I hadn't, because, you know, I don't go into a meeting and then, you know, give details of it.
[01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:33.409]  I understand.
[01:00:33.489 --> 01:00:35.770]  But no, I mean, this is how they operate.
[01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:41.811]  They traffic in the souls of men, as the Bible says, and I was told point-blank
[01:00:42.386 --> 01:00:50.888]  For those that haven't been told about this, that you want to be on this crusade, or do you want to be a star, and we'll pay a million bucks, which is Trump changed these people.
[01:00:51.248 --> 01:00:51.568]  I understand.
[01:00:51.628 --> 01:00:54.489]  I mean, he'll pay $50 million for a nothing radio station.
[01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.989]  Wow, they'd buy them up.
[01:00:56.249 --> 01:01:10.932]  I mean, I talked to the local radio station in my area, and I guess they're owned by, I don't know if it's Clear Channel or who, and I talked to the local guy, it's WSUB out of Groton, and I said, look, I said, there's a good show on Alex Jones out of Austin, Texas, you might want to think about running his show.
[01:01:11.621 --> 01:01:17.184]  And I talked with him briefly on the phone, and I got sort of a whole hummer response, and I never really heard anything from him again.
[01:01:17.745 --> 01:01:20.286]  And I think that they're owned by a larger conglomerate.
[01:01:20.767 --> 01:01:21.387]  Well, of course.
[01:01:22.087 --> 01:01:29.192]  That's why you gotta contact the mom and pops at the stations that are privately owned, and a good way to wake the owners up is to send them a copy of the videos.
[01:01:29.212 --> 01:01:30.112]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[01:01:30.132 --> 01:01:32.014]  Really appreciate that call, Eric.
[01:01:32.174 --> 01:01:33.174]  Up in Connecticut.
[01:01:33.535 --> 01:01:35.496]  I mean, that's skull and bones territory.
[01:01:36.737 --> 01:01:36.957]  Ha ha.
[01:01:37.097 --> 01:01:38.237]  Very highly controlled.
[01:01:38.257 --> 01:01:38.878]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:43.274 --> 01:01:47.638]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:01:47.818 --> 01:01:52.243]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:01:52.383 --> 01:01:56.767]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:01:56.807 --> 01:01:58.149]  The New World Order.
[01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:04.155]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:02:04.235 --> 01:02:11.163]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:02:11.283 --> 01:02:13.306]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:02:13.686 --> 01:02:24.088]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:02:24.268 --> 01:02:29.669]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:02:30.149 --> 01:02:33.470]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:33.910]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:35.210]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:45.953]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:02:46.093 --> 01:02:50.315]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:02:50.575 --> 01:02:53.456]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:56.057]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:02:56.257 --> 01:03:04.981]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:06.561]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:03:06.781 --> 01:03:11.143]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:03:11.543 --> 01:03:11.743]  I think?
[01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:48.040]  Whether you live in the country or simply dream about living in the country, Countryside and Small Stock Journal is the magazine for you.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:55.645]  You'll learn how to make cheese, sausage, wine, soap and more, build a cider press, a year-round greenhouse, or even your own home, raise and care for poultry,
[01:03:55.725 --> 01:03:58.767]  We'll rush you the latest issue of Countryside without cost or obligation.
[01:03:58.847 --> 01:03:59.608]  That's 1-800-551-5691 to get your free issue.
[01:04:23.747 --> 01:04:27.129]  If you like what you see, pay the invoice and enjoy Countryside for a full year.
[01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:31.991]  If you decide it's not for you, simply write cancel on the invoice, but keep the magazine just for taking a look.
[01:04:32.191 --> 01:04:33.032]  It's as simple as that.
[01:04:33.252 --> 01:04:37.134]  Get ready to live the good life and call 1-800-551-5691 or visit our website at www.countrysidemag.com
[01:04:44.565 --> 01:04:50.590]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:54.253]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:11.827 --> 01:05:12.788]  All right, my friends.
[01:05:13.556 --> 01:05:14.156]  Welcome back.
[01:05:14.356 --> 01:05:17.318]  Again, it's Tuesday, the 26th of August, 2003.
[01:05:17.958 --> 01:05:19.079]  Warrior Call is coming up.
[01:05:19.099 --> 01:05:24.282]  The total free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[01:05:24.882 --> 01:05:42.712]  Joining us is best-selling author, Army Colonel, he was a Marine Corps Sniper in Vietnam, Craig Roberts, he's an expert on the New World Order, and we had about an hour-long conversation last night, that'll probably go longer than this interview, on the phone about the New World Order and what it's doing right now.
[01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:45.439]  Craig, good to have you back on the show.
[01:05:45.919 --> 01:05:47.580]  Oh, Alex, always good to be back.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.520]  Too bad we didn't have two hours last night, but I think both of us were fading out toward the end.
[01:05:52.321 --> 01:05:52.961]  Absolutely.
[01:05:53.841 --> 01:05:55.741]  I tell you, there is so much to keep track of.
[01:05:55.761 --> 01:05:58.342]  They've announced they're pouring concrete at Camp X-Ray.
[01:05:58.642 --> 01:06:00.422]  There is an execution center there.
[01:06:00.922 --> 01:06:02.142]  It is for citizens.
[01:06:03.463 --> 01:06:05.463]  This is a big deal.
[01:06:05.563 --> 01:06:10.604]  The general who was there, Rick Baucus, resigned and said, I will not torture people.
[01:06:11.504 --> 01:06:16.326]  And I'm just bringing this back into the news because we forget how serious this is.
[01:06:16.366 --> 01:06:19.187]  They're institutionalizing homeland security.
[01:06:19.207 --> 01:06:20.948]  That means we'll never see an end to terror.
[01:06:21.788 --> 01:06:34.093]  As a military man in the Marines in Vietnam, then in the Army and in Army Intelligence, and as a police officer and as an expert on the New World Order, address torture, Camp X-Ray, the Patriot Act, and everything we see happening.
[01:06:34.613 --> 01:06:38.535]  Well, you know, Alex, it's really amazing how much history
[01:06:39.151 --> 01:06:42.233]  Swings its pendulum every 20 years or 30 years or so.
[01:06:43.113 --> 01:06:48.976]  Because if we go back in time, look at the French when they set up Devil's Island off the coast of South America.
[01:06:49.597 --> 01:07:03.864]  And back in the 1800s and even after the turn of the century up into the 1920s or 30s, they were still using an island as far away as they could get from home so that they could ship people off there and relatives wouldn't have any contact with them.
[01:07:03.884 --> 01:07:04.624]  You couldn't check on them.
[01:07:04.644 --> 01:07:05.745]  You didn't know what happened to them.
[01:07:06.092 --> 01:07:08.013]  And there's no way for them to escape and get home.
[01:07:08.473 --> 01:07:10.754]  Now we see something like this popping up at Guantanamo.
[01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:16.637]  That becomes extremely chilling in its own right for taking anybody except military prisoners.
[01:07:16.657 --> 01:07:35.347]  And the problem I've got with this as a police officer is what is a military prisoner now under all these new laws that they've just generated out of thin air under this Homeland Defense Act and all this other nonsense that they've come up with, with this super overreaction, with a giant codified set of statutes waiting to be passed prior to 9-11.
[01:07:36.457 --> 01:07:49.789]  So we get this blurring between the jurisdiction of the civilian law enforcement and the jurisdiction of the military and with the federal government bridging the gap with a set of laws that no one read.
[01:07:50.552 --> 01:07:52.913]  And all of a sudden, what is a military prisoner?
[01:07:53.193 --> 01:08:01.358]  You can be one now, I can be one, because all they have to do is change your designation, change your status from, you know, one into terrorist.
[01:08:01.458 --> 01:08:09.282]  Whatever it is, all they have to do is say, well, you're a terrorist, you're a cyber terrorist, you're a propaganda terrorist, you're a radio terrorist, I don't know, you know?
[01:08:09.342 --> 01:08:11.543]  Well, the states are passing
[01:08:12.473 --> 01:08:16.195]  Uh, laws that are carbon copies, in some cases worse.
[01:08:16.795 --> 01:08:21.417]  In Wisconsin, they're arresting people who sue public officials, calling it, quote, paper terrorism.
[01:08:21.998 --> 01:08:27.400]  Uh, they're trying to pass laws in Oregon, where if one protester blocks traffic, everyone gets life in prison.
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:30.201]  And it says in a, quote, forest labor camp.
[01:08:30.742 --> 01:08:36.084]  I mean, this stuff's so crazy, the average person, I don't think, can believe it when we're sitting here talking about it.
[01:08:36.244 --> 01:08:39.065]  Well, it's gonna get worse, because all they have to do is keep adding to the list.
[01:08:39.105 --> 01:08:40.386]  How about religious terrorism?
[01:08:41.095 --> 01:08:51.112]  They could go after Roy Moore for religious terrorism, or why can't they go after the judge that's making him move the Ten Commandments for religious terrorism?
[01:08:51.172 --> 01:08:52.735]  That's the real religious terrorist!
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:55.041]  Uh, you know, what is a terrorist?
[01:08:55.121 --> 01:08:57.682]  A terrorist is whatever the Justice Department says they are.
[01:08:57.702 --> 01:08:58.943]  Well, there's also a new U.N.
[01:08:59.003 --> 01:09:11.010]  treaty they're trying to pass that says that if you incite someone, now you don't even have to say, fire in a theater or go kill this person, now it's you incited it and that's going to be terrorism.
[01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:15.372]  Well, you know, this goes back to the, you know, we've passed laws through the years
[01:09:16.013 --> 01:09:17.377]  That should have never been on the books.
[01:09:17.577 --> 01:09:20.285]  One of them is conspiracy before the fact.
[01:09:20.866 --> 01:09:24.135]  In other words, two or more people get together and they talk about a crime.
[01:09:24.747 --> 01:09:27.488]  Now, they may decide later on that none of them's going to do it.
[01:09:27.528 --> 01:09:33.451]  You know, you and I decide we're going to go rob the local liquor store, then all of a sudden we say, nah, we don't want to do that, because we don't want to go to jail.
[01:09:33.911 --> 01:09:36.432]  But somebody overheard us talking about it, okay?
[01:09:36.953 --> 01:09:42.635]  There are some states where you can be arrested for that on a felony, for criminal conspiracy to plan a crime.
[01:09:42.915 --> 01:09:49.418]  Well, now there are STDs who draw a picture of a gun saying that was a premeditated, it's thought crime.
[01:09:49.658 --> 01:09:51.939]  Yeah, and that's where we're getting right now, is we're going to 1984,
[01:09:53.584 --> 01:09:57.069]  To the Thought Crimes and the Thought Police.
[01:09:57.189 --> 01:10:00.053]  We never thought it would happen in this country.
[01:10:00.093 --> 01:10:06.081]  The Constitution has provisions in there specifically to protect us against this and they just throw it out the window.
[01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:09.246]  What we found out is there are four branches of government.
[01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:13.472]  There's the executive, the legislative, the judicial, and the bureaucracy.
[01:10:13.812 --> 01:10:17.153]  The bureaucracy goes on forever, and it's this giant amoeba that eats its young.
[01:10:17.173 --> 01:10:21.915]  And what it does is it creates laws, regulations, and sub-institutions.
[01:10:21.995 --> 01:10:24.997]  Now, sub-institution is, okay, they create Homeland Defense.
[01:10:25.017 --> 01:10:32.760]  Then Homeland Defense turns around, and if they get enough money in the budget, they create institutions under them that don't fall under anybody else's purview, and then they give them
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:40.802]  Power to go out and do things by regulation, or by rules, such as the EPA, such as the Department of the Interior.
[01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:53.326]  That's what's so scary about this biggest federal agency, 1 in 12 employees under it, the others controlled by it, and all the big universities are now shifting to make a large portion of their curriculum to be Homeland Security.
[01:10:53.566 --> 01:10:55.926]  You know now they're going to list everything as terrorism.
[01:10:56.186 --> 01:10:58.307]  Now they've officially admitted it in the Victory Act.
[01:10:58.707 --> 01:11:01.049]  It was in the first Patriot Act under Section 802.
[01:11:01.089 --> 01:11:06.432]  I mean, they're gonna supply the terror, period, to legitimize this giant bureaucracy.
[01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:12.448]  And it's no different than what's happened all the way back to Roman times and Greek times.
[01:11:12.528 --> 01:11:21.195]  All you have to do is inflame the minds of the general population with an event, and then capitalize upon that by saying, we're here to save you, and this is how we're going to have to do it.
[01:11:21.275 --> 01:11:28.622]  And yes, you're going to have to lose a little bit of liberty, a little bit of freedom, but it's for your own good, it's for your own security, and that's exactly what they're doing now, and they've been doing it for the last couple of years.
[01:11:29.304 --> 01:11:37.313]  And the problem is, our public school system has thrown all of that history out the window a long time ago, so the younger generations don't know about it.
[01:11:37.373 --> 01:11:45.722]  And if guys like you and me don't educate people on this, the younger generation who's going to replace us some day is going to go right along with it like malleable clay.
[01:11:45.822 --> 01:11:47.063]  Well, let me stop you right there.
[01:11:47.164 --> 01:11:49.146]  We have millions of listeners to this show.
[01:11:49.326 --> 01:11:51.168]  A tiny fraction of you take action.
[01:11:51.923 --> 01:12:16.472]  If you would just tell friends and family about this show, about Craig's books, about my books, about my films, about our websites, riflewarrior.com, infowars.com, if you would help us and really get out there and try to recruit people to reality, to come out of this Matrix-like system, if you don't make it a big focus of your life, folks, you're gonna lose liberty, you're gonna lose freedom.
[01:12:16.652 --> 01:12:19.993]  And the Founding Fathers said this, they said, the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.
[01:12:20.738 --> 01:12:25.582]  And this whole line that Ashcroft has been saying, you know, give your liberty up to protect liberty.
[01:12:25.602 --> 01:12:28.904]  I mean, that's an oxymoron, or give your liberty up for security.
[01:12:29.224 --> 01:12:31.966]  Colonel, do we get security out of giving up liberty?
[01:12:32.346 --> 01:12:34.147]  No, the only thing we get is tyranny.
[01:12:34.188 --> 01:12:36.729]  There's no security out there at all, because security is what we make it.
[01:12:36.749 --> 01:12:38.190]  Where does security really start, Alex?
[01:12:38.210 --> 01:12:41.853]  Security starts on your own private property with you being armed.
[01:12:42.253 --> 01:12:43.134]  Under the Second Amendment.
[01:12:43.194 --> 01:12:46.276]  And it starts at the borders, too, and both of those are under attack.
[01:12:46.477 --> 01:12:48.358]  Well, we move up from your own property.
[01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:54.363]  You have to be able to secure yourself, just like a pioneer on the frontier in the old days couldn't count on the cavalry ever getting there in time.
[01:12:54.783 --> 01:12:57.145]  So you have to be able to protect yourself and your family.
[01:12:57.205 --> 01:13:01.349]  Then your friends and neighbors have to join together so you can protect your community.
[01:13:01.409 --> 01:13:04.251]  We do that with our local police, our local volunteer services.
[01:13:04.732 --> 01:13:10.076]  Then we have to worry about protecting our state because each state is an individual entity
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.403]  And we do that with the State Police, the National Guard, and so on.
[01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:20.130]  Then we worry about protecting the country, but since we can't, you and I can't really do anything about it, we pay the government to do it for us.
[01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:25.395]  We hire an army with our tax money, and they are supposed to protect our borders first.
[01:13:25.775 --> 01:13:28.578]  That is first and primary to protect the borders.
[01:13:28.598 --> 01:13:32.823]  You want Homeland Defense, then stop the immigration problem by putting troops on the borders.
[01:13:33.363 --> 01:13:34.524]  That's perfectly legitimate.
[01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:36.386]  It doesn't have anything to do with Posse Comitatus.
[01:13:36.426 --> 01:13:37.867]  It is not enforcing civil law.
[01:13:37.887 --> 01:13:39.308]  It's enforcing national defense.
[01:13:39.568 --> 01:13:44.712]  And that's where the globalists have twisted it all around and made it look like, well, we can't do that.
[01:13:44.732 --> 01:13:46.193]  That's the job of the local sheriff.
[01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:49.276]  The local sheriff can't stop 50,000 Mexicans from crossing the border.
[01:13:49.776 --> 01:13:50.377]  It can't be done.
[01:13:50.817 --> 01:13:51.778]  That's where we need the military.
[01:13:51.798 --> 01:13:56.902]  But instead, we send them to 272 places all over the world and in places we never heard of or care about.
[01:13:57.592 --> 01:14:02.736]  I would have to be real careful in that area because I have been in investigations on that before.
[01:14:19.062 --> 01:14:26.984]  Where you have agent provocateurs saying, they lost 40 people that day, and come to find out they lost 4, and somebody wanted to add a zero.
[01:14:27.524 --> 01:14:34.766]  And here's the problem we've got, is we've got families who are going to be missing loved ones, and they're going to report this someplace along the line.
[01:14:36.366 --> 01:14:38.627]  But, you know, we can't discredit it either.
[01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:43.888]  Because, here's the fact, we're not getting timely information, say from Iraq.
[01:14:43.928 --> 01:14:44.788]  Let's just pick Iraq.
[01:14:45.689 --> 01:14:47.209]  We could say Afghanistan, but let's take Iraq.
[01:14:47.777 --> 01:14:50.239]  We can't even get mail to Iraq now.
[01:14:50.499 --> 01:14:57.345]  I have personally sent packages to Iraq six weeks ago, eight weeks ago, where they had to sign for them.
[01:14:57.485 --> 01:14:58.846]  Troops in the field had to sign for them.
[01:14:58.866 --> 01:14:59.987]  I've sent care packages over there.
[01:15:00.387 --> 01:15:04.871]  I have received nothing back that they've ever gotten, and I can get through to some of them on email.
[01:15:05.211 --> 01:15:06.092]  They're not getting their mail.
[01:15:06.112 --> 01:15:09.034]  They're not getting any of these packages these people are putting together and sending over.
[01:15:09.054 --> 01:15:10.615]  They're sitting in warehouses someplace.
[01:15:10.936 --> 01:15:15.059]  So if they're not getting information going that way, we're not getting information coming back either.
[01:15:16.329 --> 01:15:28.347]  That's scary when you can't get a package of the troops and they had told them that you know when you get Baghdad you come home but I read the army reports before the war they said it was a five-year occupation
[01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:35.919]  I can't believe people bought that propaganda that they could just go subdue 21 million people and then leave them alone.
[01:15:36.399 --> 01:15:41.464]  Well, it's going to be a permanent occupation in the sense that we're not going to give up that place.
[01:15:41.484 --> 01:15:43.745]  We're not going to give up the oil fields.
[01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:47.469]  But the big thing is we want to be able to control the strategic area.
[01:15:48.129 --> 01:15:52.593]  And as we talked yesterday, let's outline this real quick so everybody can look at this in perspective.
[01:15:53.473 --> 01:15:57.596]  We started in the East with Pakistan, and they're kind of a semi-ally, depending, they're malleable.
[01:15:58.057 --> 01:16:00.739]  The New World Order guys in government use them for whatever they want to.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.701]  The CIA uses the Pakistanis.
[01:16:03.721 --> 01:16:06.083]  Pakistanis do what we want because we protect them from India.
[01:16:06.664 --> 01:16:06.964]  Okay?
[01:16:07.364 --> 01:16:09.626]  Then we took Afghanistan in 30 days.
[01:16:09.666 --> 01:16:12.128]  The Russians couldn't do it in 8 years, but we did it in 30 days.
[01:16:12.689 --> 01:16:17.533]  And as soon as we did, all of a sudden the opium production started back up again in the Northeast tribal area.
[01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.990]  Then we go west.
[01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:21.892]  We've got Turkey as an ally.
[01:16:21.992 --> 01:16:24.194]  We take Iraq in a month.
[01:16:24.835 --> 01:16:26.256]  And then we own the Persian Gulf.
[01:16:26.396 --> 01:16:28.658]  We have one place totally surrounded.
[01:16:28.678 --> 01:16:29.218]  That's Iran.
[01:16:29.258 --> 01:16:33.782]  And after the break we'll come back and we'll talk about what's going to happen next.
[01:16:34.683 --> 01:16:35.283]  Absolutely.
[01:16:35.323 --> 01:16:38.886]  And then I want to throw out a bunch of other news items here because there is a lot of it.
[01:16:39.406 --> 01:16:40.607]  And we're going to take your calls.
[01:16:40.727 --> 01:16:41.148]  Stay with us.
[01:16:43.547 --> 01:16:48.450]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a roadmap, and how easy it would be to get lost?
[01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.131]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[01:16:50.151 --> 01:16:52.492]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[01:16:52.933 --> 01:16:55.754]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[01:16:55.814 --> 01:16:56.174]  coins.
[01:16:56.415 --> 01:16:57.675]  The Red Book Guide to U.S.

[01:19:48.836 --> 01:19:49.656]  Read the labels.
[01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:54.221]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:19:54.421 --> 01:19:58.625]  Also, may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:19:58.985 --> 01:20:03.870]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:07.811]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[01:20:44.166 --> 01:20:49.289]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.

[01:20:54.068 --> 01:20:55.429]  We're talking about everything.
[01:20:55.589 --> 01:21:01.612]  Local news, national news, international news, the nature of the world, the power elite, what they're up to.
[01:21:01.632 --> 01:21:04.753]  If you want to join us on air, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:21:04.773 --> 01:21:04.853]  800-259-9231.
[01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.694]  We're talking to Colonel Craig Roberts.
[01:21:06.714 --> 01:21:07.654]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:21:07.714 --> 01:21:12.597]  Craig, when you say we are taking over, we, you're talking about the globalists that control America.
[01:21:22.125 --> 01:21:31.050]  This tiny, parasitic organization that controls the body politic, continuing with the map of the Middle East and Central Asia.
[01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.490]  Right.
[01:21:32.691 --> 01:21:34.191]  And, you know, we being U.S.
[01:21:34.231 --> 01:21:35.932]  troops, U.S.
[01:21:36.052 --> 01:21:48.119]  armed forces being utilized to take these areas, we have significantly taken a section of the Middle East and left one part out, and that is Iran.
[01:21:49.528 --> 01:21:52.850]  Because Iran sits right in the middle of all those places.
[01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:58.132]  We started at the East, we went to the North, we went to the West, and we already had the South, which is the Persian Gulf.
[01:21:58.192 --> 01:22:00.113]  It's a pond for one of the American fleets.
[01:22:00.713 --> 01:22:01.914]  We've got Iran, okay?
[01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:08.837]  Now, as we talked last night, Iran is not a hard country to overthrow if you can control the people.
[01:22:08.877 --> 01:22:11.779]  If you control the general population in Iran, they'll overthrow anybody.
[01:22:11.819 --> 01:22:12.999]  They proved it twice already.
[01:22:13.179 --> 01:22:14.300]  And they admit
[01:22:15.615 --> 01:22:21.937]  Now, that a few months ago, during the Iraq War, at the end of it, that the CIA got the students going.
[01:22:22.377 --> 01:22:25.417]  Oh yeah, and let's go back to Mosaddeh.
[01:22:25.538 --> 01:22:43.242]  If people get my book, The Medusafile, and go into the original seizure of Iran, we just sent a handful of CIA agents in, they stirred up a revolution, and they overthrew a guy named Mosaddeh, who was the head of Iran at the time, and they did it for a conglomerate of American interest plus British petroleum.
[01:22:43.582 --> 01:22:45.764]  And by the way, one of the Shah's captains who ran tortures is a Chalibi.
[01:23:03.121 --> 01:23:07.462]  This guy is convicted of stealing $300 million from the ally, the Jordanians.
[01:23:07.903 --> 01:23:17.685]  He's now setting up his own little mafia organization there in Baghdad, and when the Jordanians asked for him to be released, the Interpol said no.
[01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:26.008]  Well, you know, if you back up again and look at what happened as soon as the Shah got in, well, he had to have a secret police himself, so he set up the Savak.
[01:23:26.687 --> 01:23:28.028]  And the Zivak had what?
[01:23:28.048 --> 01:23:32.171]  They had torture chambers, they had private executions, they had all of that stuff.
[01:23:32.191 --> 01:23:34.934]  They could disappear people off the street like they did down in South America.
[01:23:34.954 --> 01:23:37.496]  All the good patriotic things we're now getting in America.
[01:23:37.736 --> 01:23:38.376]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:23:38.396 --> 01:23:45.021]  So you could do that to take care because you wanted the Shah to stay in there because you had the Russians up north and we wanted the Iranian border well secured against the Russians.
[01:23:45.542 --> 01:23:51.066]  And so American corporations went in and built giant radar stations and checkpoints and stuff all along the Iranian border.
[01:23:52.959 --> 01:23:57.060]  And then we had, of course, all the arms deals and so on that went on over there.
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:00.361]  But eventually, they had to do away with the Shah.
[01:24:00.401 --> 01:24:01.561]  I don't know exactly why.
[01:24:01.582 --> 01:24:03.962]  I haven't dug into that too far.
[01:24:04.042 --> 01:24:17.306]  But we had the revolution that happened during the Carter regime, and out goes the Shah, in comes the Ayatollahs, in comes the very people who subjugate the citizenry of Iran.
[01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:20.251]  Under a thumb of purity like they've never seen before.
[01:24:20.291 --> 01:24:23.873]  Now when you do that, what you do is you compress a political spring.
[01:24:24.474 --> 01:24:29.377]  You can only push it so far before that spring is going to spring back at you.
[01:24:30.377 --> 01:24:32.598]  A lot of times they have controlled springs.
[01:24:32.638 --> 01:24:33.659]  Look at California.
[01:24:34.039 --> 01:24:36.200]  Get out a Davis, put in a phony Arnold.
[01:24:36.581 --> 01:24:37.881]  Oh yeah, you can do that.
[01:24:37.921 --> 01:24:42.184]  But what you have to do is you have to make the people want to do something, then you pull the trigger and it happens.
[01:24:42.564 --> 01:24:44.305]  You let them do the work for you.
[01:24:44.659 --> 01:24:46.380]  And that's what they did when they overthrew the Shah.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:51.603]  Now that's what they're probably going to do when they overthrow the Muslim fundamentalists.
[01:24:51.623 --> 01:24:54.064]  They already tried it, though, just a few months ago.
[01:24:54.244 --> 01:24:58.366]  Well, that was probably a trial-and-error deal, but when they get ready to do it for real, it's going to happen.
[01:25:00.027 --> 01:25:03.449]  What you have to remember, though, everybody has to remember, we are not dealing with Arabs here.
[01:25:04.110 --> 01:25:07.571]  We are dealing with Persians, and it's a totally different mentality.
[01:25:08.552 --> 01:25:10.173]  The Persians have a much more
[01:25:11.129 --> 01:25:14.011]  military background than the Arabs ever thought of having.
[01:25:14.031 --> 01:25:16.573]  The Arabs have always been good at hit-and-run and guerrilla tactics.
[01:25:16.613 --> 01:25:23.037]  They've never, ever, ever won a stand-up battle against any kind of forces that equaled them.
[01:25:23.397 --> 01:25:26.018]  If they couldn't overcome you 10 to 1, they didn't fight.
[01:25:26.058 --> 01:25:30.861]  If they did try to attack you, they attacked your supply columns, or they attacked you while you slept at night.
[01:25:31.061 --> 01:25:32.802]  The same thing is happening in Baghdad now.
[01:25:33.083 --> 01:25:34.564]  But the Persians will stand and fight.
[01:25:34.604 --> 01:25:36.485]  They'll go into trench warfare.
[01:25:36.525 --> 01:25:37.205]  They'll do whatever.
[01:25:37.645 --> 01:25:40.087]  So we don't want to have a war with Iran
[01:25:40.572 --> 01:25:42.373]  If we can have a revolution in Iran.
[01:25:42.393 --> 01:25:45.396]  Now, how do we make the American people buy off on this?
[01:25:45.456 --> 01:25:46.216]  Well, it's real simple.
[01:25:46.416 --> 01:25:50.539]  We suffer deaths in Baghdad, and we find out that it's terrorists that come from Iran.
[01:25:50.559 --> 01:25:54.202]  Yeah, it's the Iranians doing it, or you blow something up and say the Iranians are behind it.
[01:25:54.342 --> 01:25:54.742]  That's right.
[01:25:55.023 --> 01:25:59.126]  You know, we chase these things over to the Shiites over in Iran.
[01:25:59.146 --> 01:26:07.512]  By the way, Craig, they've now connected the bombing in Baghdad to Chalibi.
[01:26:09.654 --> 01:26:11.715]  Why would the globalists want to bomb the UN building?
[01:26:12.576 --> 01:26:15.097]  Well, you have to get the UN involved.
[01:26:15.137 --> 01:26:17.699]  You've got to be able to draw them in and say, look.
[01:26:18.079 --> 01:26:19.040]  Or you have to run them off.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.261]  It depends on what the plan is, and it's hard to tell right now.
[01:26:21.281 --> 01:26:23.762]  You either have to run them completely out of the country, or you have to draw them in.
[01:26:23.782 --> 01:26:25.163]  Now, that depends on how they work it.
[01:26:25.583 --> 01:26:27.244]  So we'll just have to wait and see how that one plays out.
[01:26:27.264 --> 01:26:30.046]  All right, we'll talk about this some more and a bunch of other issues in your calls.
[01:26:30.066 --> 01:26:31.327]  When we get back, stay with us.
[01:26:33.848 --> 01:26:34.749]  We're on the march.
[01:26:35.229 --> 01:26:36.750]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.754 --> 01:26:40.555]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.797 --> 01:26:46.418]  Hardly a day goes by in the garden without the Cobra Head.
[01:26:46.558 --> 01:26:49.479]  I want to tell you about a great little garden tool called the Cobra Head.
[01:26:49.619 --> 01:26:55.301]  First, take half of the tools you're currently using in the garden, throw them away, and call 1-861-94340 or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[01:27:15.848 --> 01:27:27.090]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central during the day we do the show live and of course back from 9 to midnight central standard time as well.
[01:27:27.850 --> 01:27:31.091]  I'm Alex Jones your host we're about to go to Dan and Bob and Kevin and
[01:27:32.851 --> 01:27:36.772]  Others are patiently holding, and I hope that Colonel Roberts can stay with us into the next hour as well.
[01:27:38.772 --> 01:27:44.813]  I want to, in a few minutes, talk to Colonel Roberts about an Associated Press article, an AFP article, several others.
[01:27:45.413 --> 01:27:50.334]  Headline, Idealistic Philippine Rebellion Leaders Claim Moral Victory.
[01:27:52.335 --> 01:27:54.535]  Where it turns out that you had U.S.
[01:27:54.555 --> 01:27:58.196]  government agents involved in bombings being distracted by the CIA.
[01:27:58.336 --> 01:27:59.416]  This is in mainstream news.
[01:28:00.362 --> 01:28:06.145]  The commandos, the Philippine Special Forces, saying we're tired of getting shot and bombed by stuff our government gives them.
[01:28:06.545 --> 01:28:07.645]  This is all staged.
[01:28:07.685 --> 01:28:11.747]  They had a big uprising a month or so ago, and this has gotten almost no attention.
[01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:12.828]  We've talked about it a few times.
[01:28:12.848 --> 01:28:16.029]  We're going to get Colonel Roberts' response and analysis of it.
[01:28:18.021 --> 01:28:19.501]  And then we'll go right to your calls.
[01:28:19.521 --> 01:28:23.242]  But before we go back to Colonel Roberts, I really want every listener out there.
[01:28:23.262 --> 01:28:33.024]  Number one, I want to thank those that have gotten the films, that have gotten my book, that have gotten our t-shirts, that have supported the show and what we're doing in this fight against the New World Order.
[01:28:33.364 --> 01:28:40.125]  You know, my t-shirt that's got a picture of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao on the front and says, Mass Murderers Agree, Gun Control Works.
[01:28:40.645 --> 01:28:43.626]  The back says, Politicians Love Disarmed Peasants, Infowars.com.
[01:28:45.518 --> 01:28:47.920]  You want to meet like-minded people in your area?
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.281]  Go out in public with this on.
[01:28:50.723 --> 01:28:51.563]  That's $20, $19.95.
[01:28:51.784 --> 01:28:55.227]  The new book, Order Out of Chaos, by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:28:55.307 --> 01:28:56.067]  It is excellent.
[01:28:56.087 --> 01:29:00.952]  It covers how the British government carries out terror attacks and blames it on its enemies.
[01:29:01.172 --> 01:29:04.054]  Confirmed, admitted, mainstream news stuff, folks.
[01:29:04.635 --> 01:29:05.776]  It's right out there in the open.
[01:29:05.796 --> 01:29:08.598]  They've been caught in a bunch of cases internationally in their own country.
[01:29:09.159 --> 01:29:12.442]  How the Israelis actually have a bunch of Arabs working for them.
[01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:16.522]  Uh, who blow stuff up and who are never prosecuted, who work for Mossad.
[01:29:16.802 --> 01:29:19.602]  This is admitted stuff out of Israeli news that you never heard about.
[01:29:21.563 --> 01:29:25.884]  It's an incredible 330-something page book full of diagrams and documents, only $19.95.
[01:29:26.004 --> 01:29:30.184]  I'm now carrying a very scary book.
[01:29:31.265 --> 01:29:32.825]  I can confirm most of what's in it.
[01:29:32.965 --> 01:29:33.905]  It's 600-something pages long, $24.95.
[01:29:34.045 --> 01:29:35.986]  It's Bloodlines of the Illuminati by Fritz Springmeier.
[01:29:43.696 --> 01:29:56.952]  And it is it is the 13 Illuminati bloodlines and a few other sub bloodlines and being a study being someone who studied history it makes it even more scary when I read this book because I can't find fault with it.
[01:29:57.533 --> 01:30:01.097]  We're now carrying that the latest third edition the latest edition
[01:30:01.892 --> 01:30:05.736]  That Fritz wrote before he was framed and sent to federal prison.
[01:30:06.036 --> 01:30:10.320]  And he writes in the book, I'll probably be going to prison soon, you know, framed for something for writing this book.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:13.483]  I mean, a lot of folks died to put this information in this book.
[01:30:13.503 --> 01:30:14.324]  Let's just put it that way.
[01:30:14.944 --> 01:30:23.793]  Bloodlines of the Illuminati, my films, Roads of Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, it's my newest film, it's incredible.
[01:30:24.478 --> 01:30:29.464]  Everybody needs to see it, just for the 40 minutes that's on Patriot Act 1 and 2 and Homeland Security.
[01:30:29.484 --> 01:30:32.527]  The film's 2 hours and 40 minutes, but 40 minutes of it's on that.
[01:30:34.169 --> 01:30:37.653]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:30:38.154 --> 01:30:38.714]  Don't wait.
[01:30:38.854 --> 01:30:39.415]  Get the books.
[01:30:39.495 --> 01:30:40.196]  Get the films.
[01:30:41.017 --> 01:30:44.541]  Go look at the section with other authors' work and titles.
[01:30:44.601 --> 01:30:45.141]  Go look at
[01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:49.596]  The section with my films and books and other items.
[01:30:50.157 --> 01:30:53.499]  InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[01:30:53.519 --> 01:31:02.146]  Again, I want to thank those that have supported us in the past.
[01:31:02.186 --> 01:31:04.607]  If you haven't gotten the new items, you really need to check them out.
[01:31:04.627 --> 01:31:04.687]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:13.870]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:18.412]  And look, the films, the books, they're really waking people up.
[01:31:26.286 --> 01:31:33.954]  And before we get back into the Philippines and a hotspot for New World Order terrorism, Colonel Roberts, tell folks about some of your books and your website.
[01:31:34.495 --> 01:31:37.017]  Okay, riflewarrior.com.
[01:31:37.097 --> 01:31:43.704]  Just go there, you can buy them right over the website or you can go to just about any bookstore and go to the Special Order Department and order.
[01:31:43.744 --> 01:31:48.650]  The only three that we've got right now are the Medusa file, of course, which I think every American ought to have.
[01:31:49.451 --> 01:32:01.421]  Don't have anything else, they better get that book and dig into it, because there's nine years of investigations in there that tell you what really happened behind, about everything that's happened in this country over the last twenty, thirty years.
[01:32:01.961 --> 01:32:11.509]  And then of course, Killzone, which talks about, starts with the Kennedy assassination, but goes into the New World Order and the Illuminati and all the rest of it, and who was really responsible behind that.
[01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:16.353]  And Doorway to Hell Disaster in Somalia, which is a very timely book right now, because
[01:32:16.775 --> 01:32:21.358]  We're seeing the same thing in Iraq that we saw in Somalia, and we tell you what really happened.
[01:32:21.419 --> 01:32:23.260]  And you wrote that with General Wheeler?
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:27.143]  That was with Ed Wheeler, General Wheeler, and we've got that available.
[01:32:27.183 --> 01:32:32.126]  It's in hardback, and it's got pictures, it's got documents, it's got everything you need in it.
[01:32:32.227 --> 01:32:32.647]  Great book.
[01:32:33.391 --> 01:32:43.200]  And we have about 15 of those left in stock, so get on the website and order it, or go to the bottom of the website, and you can get the address, and go ahead and just send us a check, and we'll get it back to you.
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:48.184]  RifleWarrior.com, people really should take advantage of that, and support those that tell the truth.
[01:32:48.344 --> 01:32:59.814]  And New York City is reprinting my book, my story in Vietnam, The Walking Dead, is now back out in paperback, and it's got my picture on the cover instead of some other schmuck, like the first version had.
[01:33:00.385 --> 01:33:04.729]  So if you want to see what I look like with a Viet Cong prisoner, go down to the bookstore and look at the cover.
[01:33:04.749 --> 01:33:05.610]  You don't even have to buy it.
[01:33:05.650 --> 01:33:12.976]  But The Walking Dead, if you want to see what it was like in those days, from my eye view, is a Marine increment and is a Marine sniper.
[01:33:13.496 --> 01:33:15.538]  It's a paperback that's out there and it should be in all the bookstores.
[01:33:15.578 --> 01:33:16.659]  Well, I haven't read that one.
[01:33:16.679 --> 01:33:23.105]  I've read One Shot, One Kill, Medusafile, Sniper Looks at Ely Plaza, but Craig, Colonel,
[01:33:23.993 --> 01:33:39.136]  Before we get into this article here out of AFP and the Associated Press about the Philippine military not going along with government-sponsored terror, you talk about how ten years ago you'd go deer hunting and there'd be thirty guys and maybe two of you knew about the New World Order.
[01:33:39.176 --> 01:33:41.477]  You say now the majority know about it or are concerned.
[01:33:41.537 --> 01:33:42.117]  Talk about it.
[01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:47.818]  I do see a lot of police, a lot of military, a lot of school teachers, doctors, lawyers, auto mechanics.
[01:33:48.238 --> 01:33:52.859]  I really do see a change, a major wake-up taking place.
[01:33:52.999 --> 01:33:53.659]  Number one,
[01:33:54.821 --> 01:33:56.724]  How fast do you see that taking place?
[01:33:57.666 --> 01:33:59.228]  What's your prognosis for the future?
[01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:03.935]  And just in a nutshell, what is the New World Order master plan?
[01:34:04.376 --> 01:34:07.280]  What would the world look like if the New World Order had all its way?
[01:34:07.941 --> 01:34:09.624]  Well, they've almost got it right now.
[01:34:10.716 --> 01:34:21.465]  To answer the last question first, there are certain things that have to be done for the NWO scumbags to have what they want, and they've done most of it.
[01:34:21.525 --> 01:34:24.667]  Now, one of the things they have to do, of course, is disarm the population.
[01:34:24.767 --> 01:34:26.368]  We are the last domino.
[01:34:26.408 --> 01:34:36.956]  The entire world, basically, has been disarmed with the exception of a few ragtags running around with AK-47s here and there that are totally insignificant, uncontrollable, or in locations that we don't care about anyway.
[01:34:37.397 --> 01:34:38.998]  But as far as major populations,
[01:34:39.378 --> 01:34:45.283]  We've lost Australia, we've lost England, we've lost Europe, and we've lost Canada, and we're next.
[01:34:45.884 --> 01:34:46.684]  They're doing everything they can.
[01:34:46.704 --> 01:34:53.910]  They know they can't just have everybody just stack arms, so what they're doing is they're legislating things away a little bit at a time.
[01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:56.893]  We can go into that in great detail any time you want.
[01:34:57.293 --> 01:35:00.496]  But the next thing they have to do is they have to destroy faith.
[01:35:01.198 --> 01:35:02.998]  They have to destroy religion.
[01:35:03.298 --> 01:35:09.139]  They have to destroy our belief that we have to answer for what we do in this world.
[01:35:09.579 --> 01:35:15.380]  And if they can do that, and that's what communists did, they found out that what they had to do is they had to replace God with government.
[01:35:16.081 --> 01:35:18.281]  And God doesn't take care of you, government does.
[01:35:18.401 --> 01:35:20.781]  Don't answer to God, but you have to answer to government.
[01:35:20.801 --> 01:35:22.502]  In fact, we don't even want you talking to God.
[01:35:22.542 --> 01:35:23.622]  We want him out of your life.
[01:35:23.662 --> 01:35:25.862]  And we're going to take him out a little bit at a time.
[01:35:25.902 --> 01:35:29.823]  Now, this is called incrementalism, and this is what the Illuminati and the globalists have done.
[01:35:30.243 --> 01:35:34.486]  For over 200 years as they legislate things away a little bit at a time.
[01:35:35.126 --> 01:35:36.647]  A socialist would do that.
[01:35:36.667 --> 01:35:38.448]  A communist is a socialist with a gun.
[01:35:38.468 --> 01:35:47.613]  But a socialist will go in and they will legislate out little pieces of your house until you have nothing left but one room.
[01:35:48.269 --> 01:36:00.633]  And we do that here by taking the Ten Commandments out, by no prayer at ball games, by creating a myth of... Yeah, I just read about a city council that would say a prayer.
[01:36:00.993 --> 01:36:02.174]  They're elected officials.
[01:36:02.274 --> 01:36:04.935]  If they're elected and want to say a prayer, go right ahead.
[01:36:04.975 --> 01:36:06.115]  It's called the First Amendment.
[01:36:06.135 --> 01:36:08.956]  We've got to stop putting up with all these socialists.
[01:36:09.256 --> 01:36:15.138]  Well, what they've done is they've created a myth in our minds, and even some of my friends that know better are starting to say,
[01:36:15.758 --> 01:36:17.199]  Uh, separation of church and state.
[01:36:17.259 --> 01:36:20.540]  I have to keep jumping up and saying, guys, there is no separation of church and state.
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:21.480]  That is bogus.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.761]  That's, you know, we all know that that's a lie.
[01:36:24.022 --> 01:36:30.504]  But what they've done is they have put federal judges in place who will perpetuate that and legislate.
[01:36:30.664 --> 01:36:33.105]  And by the way, it's Bush who's out there appointing them.
[01:36:33.525 --> 01:36:34.246]  Oh, yeah.
[01:36:34.286 --> 01:36:35.026]  Well, all of them have.
[01:36:35.066 --> 01:36:38.507]  Because once you get up to the globalist level, it matters not if you're Republican or Democrat.
[01:36:38.968 --> 01:36:42.269]  Well, that's what I keep trying to get through to these neocons, but Craig,
[01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:48.053]  Jumping forward here, the police you talk to, you say they're waking up.
[01:36:48.593 --> 01:36:49.894]  What are you seeing out there?
[01:36:50.434 --> 01:36:57.959]  Well, it's funny that some of the people that five years ago that I would talk to and they'd look at me with this blank stare like, what in the world are you talking about?
[01:36:58.079 --> 01:37:03.262]  I'm now receiving email from and they're sending me articles about New World Order activities and
[01:37:03.695 --> 01:37:05.796]  And they all have their own agendas.
[01:37:05.816 --> 01:37:07.958]  They all have their own areas of concern.
[01:37:07.998 --> 01:37:11.900]  And you know, a lot of police officers, their big thing is they like to be able to go out and shoot or go hunting.
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.901]  They don't want anybody messing with their Second Amendment rights.
[01:37:14.362 --> 01:37:20.045]  But then the other friends I've got in other areas are concerned about the First Amendment rights, and the freedom of religion, and the freedom of speech rights.
[01:37:20.325 --> 01:37:22.487]  But where before, they said, well, they can't do that.
[01:37:22.527 --> 01:37:23.587]  We've got a Constitution.
[01:37:23.627 --> 01:37:29.231]  And I kept telling them, I said, look guys, the Constitution is used against you, and they will ignore it.
[01:37:30.131 --> 01:37:33.735]  Unless they want to use it, and you can't use it because they won't let you.
[01:37:33.975 --> 01:37:34.676]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:37:34.976 --> 01:37:39.041]  They'll twist it and use it for their aims and claim stuff that isn't in there.
[01:37:39.938 --> 01:37:40.959]  Well, it's like the border.
[01:37:40.999 --> 01:37:42.581]  They say, we can't put troops on the border.
[01:37:42.661 --> 01:37:45.164]  Pasi Gamma taught us, but we will have them in Ohio.
[01:37:45.184 --> 01:37:45.704]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:45.864 --> 01:37:52.091]  Yeah, we can put troops on the streets of Denver and do stuff, but we can't put them in Arizona to keep aliens out, you know.
[01:37:53.112 --> 01:37:53.873]  And so we're seeing that.
[01:37:53.933 --> 01:37:55.975]  And we're also seeing destruction of morals.
[01:37:56.235 --> 01:38:01.361]  You know, once you destroy religion and you replace God with government and you take away
[01:38:03.101 --> 01:38:05.442]  The fact that if you're bad, you're going to go to hell.
[01:38:05.462 --> 01:38:07.143]  Take that factor out of everything, you know?
[01:38:07.543 --> 01:38:11.684]  Then we're going to go to destroying our morals, and we do that with... Well, it's moral relativism.
[01:38:11.724 --> 01:38:15.205]  Well, yeah, we're torturing him, but it's okay, because our government's good.
[01:38:15.245 --> 01:38:18.346]  Or, yeah, we're taking this farmer's land, but everybody needs it.
[01:38:18.386 --> 01:38:20.327]  You know, it's all moral relativism.
[01:38:20.567 --> 01:38:21.967]  Well, yeah, and take it even further.
[01:38:21.987 --> 01:38:22.647]  Take it to the Internet.
[01:38:23.287 --> 01:38:28.529]  You know, if you can flood the world with pornography and stuff like that, and make it where the kids can get to this stuff,
[01:38:28.949 --> 01:38:32.752]  It follows the Rothschild plan, and this is the point I was trying to get to.
[01:38:33.152 --> 01:38:49.945]  If you destroy and rewrite the value system, if you destroy the morals, if you put, you know, homosexuality is a verboten thing to even talk about, and you promote it, and you can do all of these things that have always been bad in the past, but now they're good, and good is bad,
[01:38:50.285 --> 01:38:57.829]  Then what we've done is we've taken and reshaped the mind of the people to where they will accept just about anything.
[01:38:57.850 --> 01:38:58.290]  Well, that's it.
[01:38:58.310 --> 01:39:00.511]  They're now saying microchips for every kid.
[01:39:00.531 --> 01:39:03.533]  Sean Hannity says every kid should be made to have one.
[01:39:04.053 --> 01:39:04.954]  I'm a conservative.
[01:39:05.214 --> 01:39:07.655]  You're not conservative if you don't take microchips.
[01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:12.238]  Yeah, and I don't know how in the world anybody can go along with that that has any
[01:39:13.063 --> 01:39:20.603]  uh... knowledge of the bible when it got all these christian leaders out saying the chips good now well and and uh... you know they're they're neochristians
[01:39:22.692 --> 01:39:49.615]  I mean, there's so many areas we can go in this direction, but if you go to the Kills on my book and get about halfway through it, I go into the Rothschild Plan that's in 1773, and it said, you have to destroy and corrupt the youth of all nations, you have to destroy morals, you have to get rid of God, it goes right down the line, and those things came up later as the Ten Planks of Communism, and now they're in this country being implemented by our own Congress, who passes laws without even reading the things.
[01:39:50.345 --> 01:39:50.986]  Well, that's it.
[01:39:51.286 --> 01:39:52.547]  And a few men run things.
[01:39:52.607 --> 01:39:55.650]  It's like Arnold Warren Buffett flying out of the Rothschild Castle.
[01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:56.230]  Right.
[01:39:56.370 --> 01:39:57.571]  And we're also going to see FLAC.
[01:39:58.012 --> 01:40:06.319]  And FLAC is where they send something up to scare everybody, they pass a bunch of new regulations and laws, and then it goes away, but we've still got the regulations and laws.
[01:40:06.719 --> 01:40:08.741]  Case in point, what happened to SARS, Alex?
[01:40:09.341 --> 01:40:12.806]  Well, it's going to be back, but they had to pass laws to quarantine you.
[01:40:12.826 --> 01:40:15.150]  Well, we had the power outage, now Chuckie Schumer says nationalized power grid.
[01:40:23.931 --> 01:40:26.733]  Oh, by the way, I did email you that website we talked about last night.
[01:40:27.114 --> 01:40:27.914]  To what address?
[01:40:28.054 --> 01:40:29.475]  To the one you gave me.
[01:40:29.996 --> 01:40:30.356]  Oh, okay.
[01:40:31.397 --> 01:40:32.178]  We're going to post that.
[01:40:32.238 --> 01:40:39.543]  Tell folks, because there were a bunch of news articles about an EMP burst, a car is dying, a clock's changing.
[01:40:39.583 --> 01:40:40.704]  That's not on the power grid.
[01:40:41.024 --> 01:40:42.105]  Talk about that real quick.
[01:40:42.365 --> 01:40:51.873]  Okay, what I got was one of my federal guys, who's really up to speed on all the stuff we're talking about, emailed me a radar imagery
[01:40:52.415 --> 01:41:07.486]  From the National Oceanic and Space Administration, or whatever it is, Atmospheric Administration, and it was taken just before the blackout, and it shows a massive EMP burst right over Long Island, the northern Long Island in southeastern New York.
[01:41:08.307 --> 01:41:21.376]  To the exclusion of everything else in the country, here's this one giant area that just lit up on radar, which happened just right at the beginning of the blackout, which would have sent a huge power surge all the way up the grid to Canada and over to the Great Lakes.
[01:41:21.778 --> 01:41:25.100]  Which would have blown transformers and shut down portions of the grid.
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:33.426]  Now anytime you shut down just portions of the grid, automatically the rest of the grid wants to come in and switch in and take over to feed those areas.
[01:41:33.466 --> 01:41:37.708]  But when you have too many of them, then they in turn shut down because they can't handle the overload.
[01:41:37.829 --> 01:41:42.972]  And instead of destroying the system and burning up and blowing their own transformers and costing a lot of money, they just go into shutdown mode.
[01:41:42.992 --> 01:41:43.672]  Now that happened.
[01:41:43.712 --> 01:41:44.513]  It was a ripple effect.
[01:41:44.847 --> 01:41:51.833]  They went all the way from the East Coast to one-fourth of the entire, what we call, the Northeast Power Grid.
[01:41:52.094 --> 01:41:58.580]  Now, the Northeast Power Grid, interestingly enough, goes all the way to the Rocky Mountains, comes all the way down to the Red River in Southern Oklahoma.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:01.262]  You've got the Western Power Grid west of the Rockies.
[01:42:01.322 --> 01:42:02.303]  It was not affected.
[01:42:02.323 --> 01:42:06.407]  It could have shut down the same way if you'd have done this over San Francisco or Los Angeles.
[01:42:06.967 --> 01:42:10.670]  And then you've got, interesting enough Alex, you're lucky because you've got the Texas power grid.
[01:42:11.010 --> 01:42:24.040]  The Texas power grid is only Texas and eastern New Mexico, which is a very... But see, their answer is link them all up together now so this doesn't happen again when the electricians I've talked to and engineers say that's the last thing you want to do.
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.361]  Absolutely the last thing you want to do.
[01:42:25.381 --> 01:42:26.722]  You want to be able to isolate areas.
[01:42:26.762 --> 01:42:30.585]  Now, we've got this so big virus going around in everybody's email.
[01:42:31.098 --> 01:42:34.090]  And it's been so successful, it's jammed up everybody's email.
[01:42:34.130 --> 01:42:36.981]  And by the way, if we get a chance, I'll tell you how to stop it today.
[01:42:37.512 --> 01:42:49.616]  I just found out this morning, and I think everybody out there that's listening, if they've got email, they've had, you know, 50 to 200 of these stupid things coming in saying, open the attachment and all that stuff, and I'll tell you how to fix that in a minute.
[01:42:49.856 --> 01:42:59.880]  But the thing about this, we talked about this last night, and who could have written something like this that could shut down the internet email system so effectively for a length of time and then self-destruct?
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:04.061]  The average hacker out here isn't probably going to be able to do it, but the Red Chinese Army
[01:43:04.651 --> 01:43:08.593]  We sold all kinds of computer secrets to during the Clinton administration.
[01:43:08.853 --> 01:43:14.656]  They've had newspaper announcements every year saying ordering their college students to attack us.
[01:43:14.956 --> 01:43:20.979]  Right, and they have a cyber warfare division just to try to shut down our computer systems.
[01:43:20.999 --> 01:43:25.801]  Now if you can shut down the email system, why can't you write a virus to shut down the computer switching systems?
[01:43:26.702 --> 01:43:27.622]  They're all interlocked.
[01:43:28.238 --> 01:43:32.060]  And it wouldn't be that hard if you can shut down the computers and fool the computers.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:33.421]  And what did Bill Gates do last year?
[01:43:33.461 --> 01:43:35.922]  He gave Russia and China the code to Microsoft.
[01:43:36.462 --> 01:43:40.384]  I've got to stop you right there, Craig, because these folks have been holding so long, and I've got to get to this Philippines story.
[01:43:40.945 --> 01:43:42.726]  But I want to talk more about that EMP later.
[01:43:43.246 --> 01:43:45.387]  Dan in California.
[01:43:45.427 --> 01:43:45.747]  Go ahead.
[01:43:45.767 --> 01:43:46.407]  You're on the air.
[01:43:46.427 --> 01:43:48.028]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:48.449 --> 01:43:52.130]  I want to lead up to a Wackenhut contract with Guantanamo Bay.
[01:43:52.631 --> 01:43:57.013]  But I've been a Christian for over 40 years, and only God put me in a position
[01:43:57.532 --> 01:44:08.782]  I work at a Wagon Hut facility in California and I've been there only five, not even five months, but I was working at McDonnell Douglas.
[01:44:09.322 --> 01:44:10.323]  Boeing took us over.
[01:44:10.583 --> 01:44:17.009]  I was laid off at Boeing, three years unemployed, and now desperate for a job I end up at Wagon Hut.
[01:44:18.130 --> 01:44:25.616]  And just this past week I heard news that Wagon Hut officially received a contract at Guantanamo Bay.
[01:44:26.354 --> 01:44:35.142]  And that contract is with Homeland Security Department, and they're hiring people at 50% higher wages than what we're getting here in California.
[01:44:35.162 --> 01:44:41.647]  Yeah, they're building 2,000 new beds in stockade type, Auschwitz style.
[01:44:41.687 --> 01:44:42.668]  That's Miami Herald.
[01:44:42.728 --> 01:44:43.369]  Colonel Roberts?
[01:44:44.404 --> 01:44:47.508]  Yeah, and you know, Wackenhut is closely associated with the CIA.
[01:44:47.549 --> 01:44:49.551]  They get prime cut on contracts.
[01:44:49.751 --> 01:44:50.893]  There's two or three organizations.
[01:44:50.933 --> 01:44:53.256]  DynCorp is one, Wackenhut's one.
[01:44:53.276 --> 01:44:58.283]  I got a $178,000 job offer if I wanted to go to Baghdad and trade Iraqi police.
[01:44:58.483 --> 01:44:59.004]  Stay there.
[01:44:59.704 --> 01:45:00.526]  Stay there too, Dan.
[01:45:00.826 --> 01:45:01.487]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:04.938 --> 01:45:12.464]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:45:12.744 --> 01:45:25.674]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[01:45:25.994 --> 01:45:29.317]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:45:29.657 --> 01:45:40.126]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:45:40.407 --> 01:45:40.907]  That's right!
[01:45:41.087 --> 01:45:48.213]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:45:48.493 --> 01:45:52.577]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter.
[01:45:52.757 --> 01:46:00.001]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:46:00.161 --> 01:46:04.884]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:46:05.044 --> 01:46:09.387]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:46:09.547 --> 01:46:13.969]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:46:14.129 --> 01:46:18.492]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:46:18.532 --> 01:46:19.873]  The New World Order.
[01:46:21.674 --> 01:46:25.876]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:46:25.936 --> 01:46:32.881]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:46:33.001 --> 01:46:35.082]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:46:35.342 --> 01:46:45.828]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:46:46.029 --> 01:46:48.150]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[01:46:48.490 --> 01:46:51.391]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!
[01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:54.513]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:46:54.533 --> 01:46:55.073]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:46:55.133 --> 01:46:55.654]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:46:55.674 --> 01:46:56.954]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:47:04.338 --> 01:47:08.982]  Have you been tricked into believing that you can't hire or be hired without a social security number?
[01:47:09.162 --> 01:47:15.106]  You think that you can't bank, get a driver's license, or rent an apartment, or get insurance without a social security number?
[01:47:15.306 --> 01:47:18.148]  It seems everywhere you turn, somebody is asking for it.
[01:47:18.288 --> 01:47:25.674]  But did you know there is no law requiring you to obtain, have, or use a social security number to live or work in the United States?
[01:47:25.874 --> 01:47:34.344]  The Social Security Number Not Required Policy Manual from Nonumber.com tells you how to assert your rights and live free as an unenumerated American.
[01:47:34.464 --> 01:47:37.167]  Go online at Nonumber.com or call 1-800-831-6141 and order your
[01:47:40.831 --> 01:47:41.612]  We're good to go.
[01:48:13.228 --> 01:48:21.792]  Kellogg, Kellogg, Brown and Root, subdivision of Halliburton, is giving contracts to Wackenhut and others.
[01:48:24.393 --> 01:48:36.438]  And Wackenhut, you know, is just an offshoot of things like the Pinkertons, where the government hires private thugs to do their bidding, like we've seen in the formation of the West of this nation.
[01:48:37.882 --> 01:48:41.284]  Dan in California, anything else you wanted to add before we go to Bob, Kevin, and others?
[01:48:41.905 --> 01:48:54.953]  Yeah, well I can add that the term starts in October and we were given notice that for any correctional officer by this coming Friday to give notice to a warrant if we want to go down there.
[01:48:55.534 --> 01:48:58.296]  But it's limited, they don't allow families, it's just the
[01:48:59.133 --> 01:48:59.433]  Really?
[01:48:59.453 --> 01:49:01.053]  They want single persons?
[01:49:01.334 --> 01:49:04.894]  You know, sir, this will be a job as a concentration camp guard.
[01:49:04.974 --> 01:49:08.635]  They are killing people and torturing people to death at that base.
[01:49:08.895 --> 01:49:10.476]  The general over it quit.
[01:49:12.356 --> 01:49:13.276]  Yeah.
[01:49:13.556 --> 01:49:15.477]  Interesting.
[01:49:15.497 --> 01:49:17.397]  You might go servitor in the death camp.
[01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:19.938]  Of course, if you criticize it, you might independent.
[01:49:20.718 --> 01:49:27.900]  Yeah, but I know the Lords are going to be with me down there, but I've got other things that I have here to deal with, too.
[01:49:28.821 --> 01:49:39.791]  Uh, but I just can't see, how can Homeland Security be in charge, if they're only homeland within our own borders, why do they have anything contract outside of our borders?
[01:49:39.911 --> 01:49:41.432]  Colonel Roberts just said it.
[01:49:41.993 --> 01:49:42.874]  It's devil's island.
[01:49:45.063 --> 01:49:47.025]  It's a place where your family can't get to you.
[01:49:47.406 --> 01:49:51.471]  It's inside a country run by a communist dictator.
[01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:52.512]  Colonel Roberts comments.
[01:49:54.134 --> 01:49:59.239]  We don't have a whole lot of extra real estate at Gitmo, so my question is, why have it there to begin with?
[01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:01.342]  I mean, temporarily using a brig is one thing.
[01:50:01.912 --> 01:50:07.958]  But, you know, we've got entire military bases here on this country that are set up to be used as a detention camp.
[01:50:08.819 --> 01:50:09.900]  What happened in the takeover?
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:19.268]  My video of the takeover, local newscast, Seattle, and it shows the FEMA camp, and they say, Sam Point, FEMA camp, we're going to put the protesters in it.
[01:50:19.349 --> 01:50:20.249]  The Army did it.
[01:50:20.710 --> 01:50:23.072]  And they had plenty of other jails, but they don't care.
[01:50:23.092 --> 01:50:25.915]  Yeah, but the thing about it is, if they brought them here,
[01:50:26.952 --> 01:50:28.994]  People, you know, media people could find them.
[01:50:29.014 --> 01:50:29.975]  You and I could find them.
[01:50:30.015 --> 01:50:30.876]  We could do interviews.
[01:50:30.916 --> 01:50:32.077]  We could see what's going on.
[01:50:32.337 --> 01:50:35.240]  But there is no overwatch if you're on an island someplace.
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:38.322]  And we could set up a high-powered lens and take photos.
[01:50:38.603 --> 01:50:47.350]  Interestingly enough, when I was in Hawaii two years ago, I was told that there is no prisons in Hawaii that keep prisoners that they subcontract with the state of Texas.
[01:50:47.471 --> 01:50:51.114]  And that you get all the Hawaiian felons down there and Hawaii just pays you.
[01:50:51.847 --> 01:50:54.448]  I don't think I'm going to.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:23.820]  Apostle Paul is the Alex Jones of that day, and we're not to obey the government like the New Translation said.
[01:51:24.799 --> 01:51:31.344]  And he was writing to the church, and that's the church leaders, and I just wanted to get that in, because I couldn't call in last time.
[01:51:31.604 --> 01:51:32.485]  Well, thank you.
[01:51:32.865 --> 01:51:38.629]  Colonel Roberts, Romans 13, used by Hitler, they've taken it, they've really warped it.
[01:51:38.869 --> 01:51:41.351]  Your comments to the render unto Caesar comment.
[01:51:41.591 --> 01:51:43.193]  Well, that's pretty apparent.
[01:51:43.293 --> 01:51:45.934]  There's one place in the entire Bible where it talks about that.
[01:51:45.955 --> 01:51:49.137]  It says, render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, render unto God what is God's.
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:52.282]  What is Caesar's?
[01:51:52.342 --> 01:51:53.644]  Not very darn much.
[01:51:53.864 --> 01:51:55.127]  And that's what we lose sight of.
[01:51:55.227 --> 01:51:57.430]  It isn't what Caesar says is Caesar's.
[01:51:57.971 --> 01:52:00.636]  It's basically that
[01:52:01.027 --> 01:52:06.988]  You have to support the government as long as it's a just government.
[01:52:07.028 --> 01:52:10.249]  But when the government is no longer just, then you have to do something about it.
[01:52:10.369 --> 01:52:11.689]  Now, our family loves to do that.
[01:52:12.150 --> 01:52:12.790]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:16.250]  I mean, the whole Bible is people standing up to corrupt governments.
[01:52:16.531 --> 01:52:22.752]  There's been more corrupt governments thrown out and overcome or wiped out in the Bible than there is that have been supported.
[01:52:23.775 --> 01:52:27.837]  You know, I mean, they've gone in and they've taken whole countries and destroyed the government's own because they were evil.
[01:52:28.078 --> 01:52:29.178]  And that's what we're really talking.
[01:52:29.198 --> 01:52:30.479]  You and I talk about this all the time.
[01:52:30.859 --> 01:52:32.660]  Folks, it's just good against evil.
[01:52:33.081 --> 01:52:34.021]  It's that simple.
[01:52:34.722 --> 01:52:40.145]  Except evil disguises itself in a hundred different patterns and tries to convince us that it's good.
[01:52:41.225 --> 01:52:42.206]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:42.326 --> 01:52:43.147]  Alright, third hour.
[01:52:43.207 --> 01:52:44.127]  Colonel, can you stay with us?
[01:52:44.267 --> 01:52:45.388]  I'll stay with you as long as you want.
[01:52:45.408 --> 01:52:45.528]  Good.
[01:52:45.548 --> 01:52:51.752]  Well, the whole next hour we'll talk to Bob, Kevin, others, and a bunch of news we haven't gotten to this Philippines news yet.
[01:52:51.792 --> 01:52:52.112]  We will.
[01:52:56.323 --> 01:53:00.847]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:53:01.147 --> 01:53:05.250]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:53:05.530 --> 01:53:12.956]  We wa- This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:20.578 --> 01:53:21.199]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.879 --> 01:53:22.900]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:24.781]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:25.402 --> 01:53:26.222]  You want answers?
[01:53:27.003 --> 01:53:27.863]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.883 --> 01:53:32.266]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.727 --> 01:53:38.131]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:38.971 --> 01:53:45.856]  All right, my friends, we're back live, already into the third and final hour of this Tuesday, the 26th of August, 2003 edition.
[01:53:49.919 --> 01:53:54.682]  And Bob, Kevin, Willie, Joe, and others, your calls are coming up right now.
[01:53:54.722 --> 01:53:57.203]  We've got Colonel Craig Roberts on the line with us.
[01:53:58.324 --> 01:53:59.484]  And I want to get to this.
[01:53:59.664 --> 01:54:03.006]  Idealistic Philippine rebellion leaders claim moral victory.
[01:54:03.667 --> 01:54:05.187]  This hasn't gotten reported properly.
[01:54:05.207 --> 01:54:09.890]  It came out from the French news agency, Associated Press, in an article about it.
[01:54:10.150 --> 01:54:11.691]  And we need to talk about this.
[01:54:11.911 --> 01:54:19.015]  You heard about the rebellion going on a month ago there, but you didn't hear why it was going on there.
[01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:22.192]  In fact, just exactly a month ago.
[01:54:23.393 --> 01:54:31.199]  So, we'll be discussing this with Colonel Roberts, because he's done a lot of study of the Philippines, interesting things that are happening there, and just a bunch of other news reports.
[01:54:31.259 --> 01:54:32.560]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.722]  Bob in Montana, you're on the air.
[01:54:34.742 --> 01:54:35.422]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:54:39.446 --> 01:54:39.866]  Okay.
[01:54:40.627 --> 01:54:42.408]  Yes, hello, Alex and Colonel Roberts.
[01:54:44.597 --> 01:54:50.580]  I could highly recommend Killzone and Medusophile as I've read those, but that's not the main reason I call.
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:55.462]  Earlier you mentioned the Shah's security force and the torture and all of that.
[01:54:56.182 --> 01:55:01.845]  His security force was most likely trained at the School of the Americas where they've trained other
[01:55:02.429 --> 01:55:04.631]  Other nations security forces also.
[01:55:05.012 --> 01:55:06.093]  Well, yeah, that's the point.
[01:55:06.373 --> 01:55:10.197]  And just because the left protested doesn't mean that the school's good.
[01:55:10.498 --> 01:55:12.940]  The left's all for torture just when leftists are doing it.
[01:55:13.321 --> 01:55:16.204]  I'm against it when leftists are doing it or phony right-wing people are doing it.
[01:55:16.564 --> 01:55:20.208]  The School of America does train people in death squad activities.
[01:55:20.248 --> 01:55:20.929]  Colonel comments?
[01:55:21.409 --> 01:55:28.674]  Well, you can trace that all the way back to Edward Lansdale in the Philippines, before the Vietnam War, and during the Vietnam War.
[01:55:28.714 --> 01:55:34.597]  You can trace it down to South America, when a lot of the South American dictator's security forces were trained there.
[01:55:35.298 --> 01:55:43.843]  What happens is they create a school, then all of a sudden there's little tentacles that branch out into other areas and say, oh, by the way, while you're here, let me tell you what else you can do.
[01:55:44.603 --> 01:55:49.066]  And then sometimes it just gets out of hand, and I think School of the Americas went that way with a lot of these
[01:55:49.628 --> 01:55:54.670]  These alleged right-wing dictators that some of them turned out left-wing dictators later on, but that's beside the point.
[01:55:55.891 --> 01:55:59.032]  Yeah, we saw that back especially in the 60s.
[01:55:59.892 --> 01:56:04.113]  If you really want to read about some interesting things, look up General Edward Lansdale.
[01:56:04.153 --> 01:56:09.214]  The guy's the first two or three-star general that ever surfaced that only had one row of combat ribbons.
[01:56:09.354 --> 01:56:10.514]  I don't even think they were combat.
[01:56:10.534 --> 01:56:12.674]  I think they were for hanging out at the Officer's Club or something.
[01:56:13.074 --> 01:56:14.814]  But this guy was a spook deluxe.
[01:56:14.935 --> 01:56:17.695]  He fomented more revolutions than you could shake a stick at.
[01:56:17.715 --> 01:56:19.695]  He's even been linked to the Kennedy assassination.
[01:56:20.095 --> 01:56:22.896]  He was involved in the assassination of the Diem brothers over in
[01:56:23.696 --> 01:56:23.796]  Yes.
[01:56:23.836 --> 01:56:29.458]  The comment I wanted to make was, now we're seeing them talk about torture and stuff in this country.
[01:56:53.638 --> 01:56:57.221]  What's happening is the biblical principle that you reap what you sow.
[01:56:58.162 --> 01:57:00.904]  And also one comment on Guantanamo Bay.
[01:57:01.584 --> 01:57:05.968]  The reason they're using that down there is the Constitution does not apply because it's out there.
[01:57:05.988 --> 01:57:07.749]  Yeah, they're saying it's under admiralty.
[01:57:07.789 --> 01:57:09.250]  In fact, they've even said that in the rulings.
[01:57:09.290 --> 01:57:13.493]  Well, this isn't military and this isn't civilian.
[01:57:13.673 --> 01:57:18.077]  This is admiralty under our enemy combatant designation.
[01:57:19.136 --> 01:57:23.057]  Right, and that's all I have, so God bless you folks.
[01:57:23.397 --> 01:57:24.258]  Well, thank you, Bob.
[01:57:24.978 --> 01:57:34.861]  That's a great point you made, Colonel, because I meant to say that last hour never did, that they're doing it there because it's outside the U.S., it's kind of in this territorial jurisdiction.
[01:57:35.841 --> 01:57:41.903]  Right, and you can go even further because you have to designate the difference between military law and admiralty law.
[01:57:41.943 --> 01:57:42.743]  There is a difference.
[01:57:43.084 --> 01:57:47.465]  Military law has to do with the Army, and I guess the Air Force would fall under that
[01:57:48.041 --> 01:57:53.402]  But the Admiralty Law is Navy and Marine Corps, and it goes to the Law of the High Seas, which is totally different.
[01:57:53.502 --> 01:57:55.723]  And it's like every naval base is just like a ship.
[01:57:55.783 --> 01:57:56.963]  It's a country within itself.
[01:57:57.183 --> 01:57:58.863]  And then look at how they're administering it.
[01:57:58.903 --> 01:57:59.803]  Who's administering it?
[01:58:00.143 --> 01:58:01.244]  Navy and the Marines.
[01:58:01.804 --> 01:58:01.964]  Right.
[01:58:02.004 --> 01:58:05.924]  See, and also, naval personnel do not fall under posse comitatus anyway.
[01:58:06.265 --> 01:58:07.185]  That's only for the Army.
[01:58:08.645 --> 01:58:11.586]  And who have they been training for the Urban Warfare Gun Compensation?
[01:58:11.686 --> 01:58:13.446]  But the Marines will be right back.

[01:59:06.028 --> 01:59:24.360]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:29.383]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:29.583 --> 01:59:35.247]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:35.447 --> 01:59:40.010]  Witness in horror, the execution of the September 11th attacks, and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:59:40.210 --> 01:59:47.374]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:59:47.394 --> 01:59:51.476]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:59:51.476 --> 01:59:51.916]  Much more.
[01:59:52.096 --> 01:59:54.617]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:59:54.817 --> 02:00:01.580]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:07.043]  Order online now at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:07.063 --> 02:00:07.463]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:00:15.942 --> 02:00:24.547]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:00:24.788 --> 02:00:36.054]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:00:36.275 --> 02:00:38.916]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:00:39.256 --> 02:00:43.379]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:00:43.579 --> 02:00:45.722]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:00:45.862 --> 02:00:47.744]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:00:47.945 --> 02:00:53.972]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:00:54.233 --> 02:00:59.880]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:00.841]  Okay, let's talk to Kevin.
[02:01:29.742 --> 02:01:33.844]  Then we'll cover this news about the Philippines and government-sponsored terror.
[02:01:34.484 --> 02:01:38.646]  Then we'll shift gears and go to Willie and Joe and Darren and others.
[02:01:39.867 --> 02:01:41.187]  Kevin in Texas, go ahead.
[02:01:41.207 --> 02:01:45.249]  Hey Alex, Colonel Roberts, it's a great honor to speak to you.
[02:01:45.369 --> 02:01:46.569]  You guys got my head spinning.
[02:01:46.649 --> 02:01:51.292]  I originally called up to talk about the Dallas Police Force, but I'll get to that in a second.
[02:01:53.174 --> 02:01:53.674]  I'm sitting here.
[02:01:53.714 --> 02:01:59.817]  I guess if your previous caller was going to be the guy turning the ovens on in Guantanamo Bay, I guess my brother is going to be the train driver.
[02:02:00.577 --> 02:02:06.860]  I'm looking at an MPEG file on CD that was sent to my brother through his airline.
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:14.883]  They're getting the civil contract to start running, or the DOD contract to start running into Guantanamo Bay, and this is the tutorial.
[02:02:15.646 --> 02:02:21.030]  On how to come into the airspace, because it's all Cuban airspace around there, but October sounds about right.
[02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:23.531]  That's what this is designed to be implemented.
[02:02:24.072 --> 02:02:26.713]  Wow, they're going to need to round up a lot of folks in October.
[02:02:26.893 --> 02:02:30.296]  I guess more than the military can handle, so they have to sell it out.
[02:02:30.336 --> 02:02:35.619]  And they're out there pouring concrete for a mass camp, according to the Miami Herald.
[02:02:35.799 --> 02:02:37.220]  Yeah, well, it's going to happen, I guess.
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:39.281]  Hey, I wonder what's coming up in September, Colonel.
[02:02:40.042 --> 02:02:41.703]  Well, I've got a question first.
[02:02:42.690 --> 02:02:51.734]  If this is going to be a civil airline transport contract to haul prisoners in, is there any information in this MPEG file that you've got showing where they're flying from?
[02:02:51.754 --> 02:02:54.515]  No, not anything there.
[02:02:54.555 --> 02:02:58.497]  It's just the procedures on how to arrive and depart out of Guantanamo Bay.
[02:02:58.537 --> 02:03:00.157]  For those who don't know, I know Kevin.
[02:03:00.197 --> 02:03:01.258]  He's done some work with me.
[02:03:02.986 --> 02:03:09.532]  He lives here in Dallas, in Austin, and I know your brother, he's the pilot, I don't want to get into too much detail.
[02:03:09.572 --> 02:03:12.534]  I'm not going to say what airline he flies for or anything.
[02:03:12.554 --> 02:03:20.321]  So it's a big business where the loafer's calling in to get the camp jobs at the ovens, and then your brother's going to be flying people in?
[02:03:20.361 --> 02:03:23.785]  I mean, he's basically, being an airline pilot, you're basically a federal employee.
[02:03:23.905 --> 02:03:26.207]  I mean, you can't rock the boat too much.
[02:03:26.915 --> 02:03:32.137]  I wanted to say, I've read the Somalia book that Roberts has and the One Shot One Kill.
[02:03:32.437 --> 02:03:42.701]  He is an excellent writer and he's somebody that has credibility from the military that can bridge this gap, you know, where someone would be called a conspiracy nut or whatever and not have any credibility.
[02:03:43.141 --> 02:03:43.701]  He has it.
[02:03:45.302 --> 02:03:51.424]  One thing I noticed that, you know, until about a week ago, they kept saying, well, the death toll since hostilities ended in Iraq is at 50.
[02:03:51.885 --> 02:03:53.065]  And I'm like, how can it be at 50?
[02:03:53.705 --> 02:03:55.206]  We've had 10 killed this week.
[02:03:55.939 --> 02:04:01.822]  Today I saw they came out and said it's 138, so it's jumped from about 50 to 138 in a weekend.
[02:04:02.042 --> 02:04:10.567]  Also, all the government websites said all combat activities have ended, and then now they've changed them all, and news articles have all changed to major.
[02:04:11.028 --> 02:04:13.789]  Well, Kay Bailey Hutchison yesterday... Colonel, Colonel, we've confirmed this.
[02:04:14.049 --> 02:04:18.352]  They're actually going back, not just to government sites now, but newspapers and changing that.
[02:04:18.652 --> 02:04:22.414]  What does it mean when retroactively newspapers start getting edited?
[02:04:23.163 --> 02:04:25.504]  Well, that's common practice, though.
[02:04:25.844 --> 02:04:37.608]  If you look at Operation Mockingbird, where the CIA controls the media anyway, they have to be able to go along with the government program because you have to control the minds of the people, and you do that by rewriting history.
[02:04:37.628 --> 02:04:40.409]  Well, that's right out of the Ministry of Truth in Winston.
[02:04:41.689 --> 02:04:45.871]  Colonel Roberts, I don't know if you know about this, but in March I filmed a
[02:04:46.707 --> 02:04:47.567]  We're good to go.
[02:05:09.164 --> 02:05:15.848]  You know, we can't tell the American public that Iraq's a base of operations, and then go to Iran, and then Syria, and then Saudi Arabia.
[02:05:15.868 --> 02:05:16.808]  They'd never stand for it.
[02:05:16.908 --> 02:05:25.553]  Kevin shot that footage there at the meeting, and it is just chilling, chilling stuff.
[02:05:25.593 --> 02:05:31.196]  And he talked about World War IV, then a month later it was on CNN, big headline, Woolsey says we're in World War IV.
[02:05:31.236 --> 02:05:33.597]  But yeah, they sit around and brag with news cameras.
[02:05:34.833 --> 02:05:37.694]  That we've got to lie to the people and can't let them know what we're doing.
[02:05:38.135 --> 02:05:39.736]  Ron Paul's speech talks about that.
[02:05:39.756 --> 02:05:41.897]  How the neocons brag, how they manipulate us.
[02:05:42.117 --> 02:05:42.917]  Incredible speech.
[02:05:42.957 --> 02:05:44.658]  That's going to be a historic document.
[02:05:44.758 --> 02:05:53.823]  Why are they so arrogant, Colonel, that they can just publicly brag in front of ten news cameras that, yeah, we're going to lie to the people and this will never be on the news as they look at the news cameras?
[02:05:54.343 --> 02:05:58.785]  Well, you know, I think that they think they have a handle on the whole situation that's not going to be changed now.
[02:05:59.426 --> 02:06:01.527]  And a lot of them are getting a little bit reckless.
[02:06:03.190 --> 02:06:08.893]  Which is good because it shows stupidity on their part because not all of us are dumb down to the point where we don't see this stuff.
[02:06:08.913 --> 02:06:10.755]  Why do criminals always get reckless?
[02:06:12.856 --> 02:06:17.459]  I think it's human nature that you get cocky and you get overconfident.
[02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:25.605]  You see it in sports where one team goes out, they've won five games in a row and they know that this team is not going to be a challenge and they get beat because they get overconfident.
[02:06:26.338 --> 02:06:30.662]  But these people, they start announcing things ahead, and a lot of times they'll do that just to see what kind of play they get.
[02:06:30.682 --> 02:06:31.843]  They can always deny it later.
[02:06:31.883 --> 02:06:35.165]  They say, that's not what I meant, or it was taken out of context, you know.
[02:06:35.426 --> 02:06:36.486]  Well, they don't even say that.
[02:06:36.566 --> 02:06:39.028]  They say, I never said there was a Patriot Act, do you?
[02:06:39.249 --> 02:06:40.870]  And then, oh yes, we need to pass it.
[02:06:41.090 --> 02:06:42.451]  And then, I never said I did that.
[02:06:42.491 --> 02:06:45.474]  I mean, I've got them on tape going, there is no second Patriot Act.
[02:06:45.694 --> 02:06:46.575]  It does not affect citizens.
[02:06:46.595 --> 02:06:48.036]  Later, there is a second Patriot Act.
[02:06:48.056 --> 02:06:48.836]  You better pass it.
[02:06:48.856 --> 02:06:50.177]  It does affect citizens.
[02:06:50.217 --> 02:06:55.762]  Colonel Roberts, Anne Lee Slaughter did a two-hour presentation two nights before this particular meeting.
[02:06:56.178 --> 02:06:57.359]  And I've got the handout from it.
[02:06:57.399 --> 02:06:59.780]  The name of her lecture was A New World Order.
[02:06:59.881 --> 02:07:00.841]  Yeah, I showed it on TV.
[02:07:00.901 --> 02:07:04.023]  And they're all just clapping and laughing and patting each other on the back.
[02:07:04.083 --> 02:07:13.470]  But we've just got to get to a point where we can tell people these things and they don't forget when they go to sleep and they go, you know, oh wow, you know, that was weird.
[02:07:13.490 --> 02:07:14.350]  I did hear about that.
[02:07:14.410 --> 02:07:16.352]  But people don't connect the dots.
[02:07:16.412 --> 02:07:20.815]  But last thing I wanted to say, you're a police officer, a retired police officer.
[02:07:21.155 --> 02:07:24.417]  The Dallas Police Force and all of Dallas politics,
[02:07:24.941 --> 02:07:29.464]  It's so racially driven, it's a joke, it's a media circus always.
[02:07:29.524 --> 02:07:31.065]  It's a way to control everybody.
[02:07:31.185 --> 02:07:49.277]  They put in this police chief, bumped him up over everyone's head, I think he was a patrol officer, a black man, there was a complete purge of the upper echelon of the Dallas police force, which I mean, you know, maybe it's not such a bad thing since they're probably one of the most corrupt departments in the world, but the fallout was predictable.
[02:07:49.733 --> 02:07:51.094]  He wasn't able to handle the job.
[02:07:51.134 --> 02:07:53.315]  There was great divisions between the power structure.
[02:07:53.695 --> 02:07:55.836]  It's been nothing but a failure for him.
[02:07:55.876 --> 02:07:56.956]  There's so many shootings here.
[02:07:57.276 --> 02:07:59.337]  Today, an hour ago, he was fired.
[02:07:59.897 --> 02:08:01.938]  So now, it's a racial divide.
[02:08:02.318 --> 02:08:10.602]  Last week, Giuliani and Associates were in town pitching to the City Council how they can come in and run the Dallas Police Department like they did New York.
[02:08:11.092 --> 02:08:14.053]  Yes, I'm writing an analysis of the Victory Act.
[02:08:38.012 --> 02:08:39.233]  And let me just say this in a nutshell.
[02:08:39.253 --> 02:08:43.396]  The Victory Act has some new stuff, but mainly it's Patriot Act 1 and Patriot Act 2.
[02:08:43.917 --> 02:08:50.942]  Some of the key provisions mixed together because they're afraid stuff's getting repealed, they want to re-pass it again under new names.
[02:08:51.002 --> 02:08:58.308]  But just for folks to understand here, they have another bill that takes over local governments.
[02:08:58.869 --> 02:09:02.551]  And this new bill, and I have the bill number in the document, I can't remember it right now.
[02:09:03.152 --> 02:09:05.634]  It's in my analysis, I just mention it and have a subsection.
[02:09:06.323 --> 02:09:12.165]  Detroit, LA, New York, Times-Picani reported on New Orleans.
[02:09:12.225 --> 02:09:14.086]  They just calmly announced the feds around the city.
[02:09:14.606 --> 02:09:17.127]  So they get a city in trouble and the feds come in and take over.
[02:09:17.167 --> 02:09:18.527]  Colonel Roberts, how important is that?
[02:09:19.527 --> 02:09:27.290]  Well, it's extremely important because there's two things that's happening and your caller just mentioned one that brought one to mind.
[02:09:28.911 --> 02:09:29.771]  People don't understand.
[02:09:29.791 --> 02:09:30.731]  They don't know that this is happening.
[02:09:31.812 --> 02:09:35.693]  There is a national organization of chiefs of police
[02:09:36.275 --> 02:09:46.499]  That of major cities that do everything they can to convince mayors to hire very liberal or very socialist or very politically correct New World Order type police chiefs.
[02:09:46.779 --> 02:09:55.162]  And when you hire a police chief, the reflection of the department is whatever his vision is, so to speak, or whatever his agenda is.
[02:09:55.503 --> 02:09:57.263]  And I have seen this happen all over the country.
[02:09:57.303 --> 02:09:59.084]  I've seen it happen in our own department here in Tulsa.
[02:09:59.745 --> 02:10:00.025]  I don't
[02:10:22.805 --> 02:10:38.528]  When they can't do that, or when something else goes astray, what they do is they say, gee, it's such a disaster, we're going to have to fire this guy, we've got to have help, and we're going to have to go outside the department to get help, and we're going to have to go here, and we're going to have to go there, and they end up bringing in federal authorities to take over in the interim.
[02:10:39.128 --> 02:10:40.268]  Texas isn't the first place.
[02:10:40.348 --> 02:10:42.949]  I mean, this has happened in other states as well, especially up north.
[02:10:43.369 --> 02:10:48.230]  Now what happens at that point is you get the FBI that comes in, let's say.
[02:10:48.797 --> 02:10:52.539]  And they put their idea of the way this department ought to be running.
[02:10:52.559 --> 02:11:00.443]  What they do is they come in with new policies and procedures, they come in with new... And they say 50 of your officers are now going to be watching the evil right-wingers.
[02:11:01.043 --> 02:11:06.806]  Oh yeah, they can create sub-task force in different units and reorganize the whole department into whatever image they want.
[02:11:06.846 --> 02:11:09.427]  And at that point it becomes nothing but a clone of the federal government.
[02:11:10.548 --> 02:11:11.768]  And here's another thing that's happening.
[02:11:11.808 --> 02:11:15.250]  We're seeing what's known as cross-deputization and cross-commissioning.
[02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:27.124]  That means I'm out here on the streets and they call me into squad meeting and say this is agent so-and-so from the federal government and we're going to now make you a federal officer as well as a city and state officer.
[02:11:27.464 --> 02:11:31.950]  You are now going to have two commissions so that you can be task forced to help
[02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:59.905]  on joint uh... task forces to deal with drugs or deal with uh... there's no reason there's no reason to do that no there's no because what you've done that once you cross deputize everybody across the country you have created a national police force that above all is answerable to the department of justice and that's what FEMA has on their badges is national police force that's right and and and once you get to answering to the department of justice you answer to whoever the uh... head of the department of justice is which means you answer also to the president of the united states
[02:12:00.665 --> 02:12:02.247]  And because he works for the President.
[02:12:02.307 --> 02:12:09.292]  So in your chain of command, it jumps from out of your local jurisdiction under your second badge.
[02:12:09.312 --> 02:12:12.755]  Yeah, all it does is make the police chief the city governor.
[02:12:12.955 --> 02:12:14.296]  Yeah, he's redundant at that point.
[02:12:14.997 --> 02:12:20.201]  Yeah, he's the guy held accountable for stuff and he's the buffer zone, but he's not the power behind the throne now.
[02:12:20.561 --> 02:12:22.642]  The power behind the throne is the guy you answer to in Washington.
[02:12:22.662 --> 02:12:24.382]  Basically, you've got a ready-made patsy.
[02:12:24.843 --> 02:12:25.023]  Right.
[02:12:25.183 --> 02:12:32.425]  And the feds come in and teach you how to not just shoot some innocent kid in the butt, but here, we'll burn down a church and kill everybody inside and make it look good.
[02:12:32.685 --> 02:12:34.446]  We'll teach you how to be real professionals.
[02:12:35.186 --> 02:12:45.570]  Well, you know, the thing that goes beyond that is what happens when all of a sudden they say, we have a national emergency, you are now operating all as federal agents.
[02:12:45.670 --> 02:12:49.031]  Oh, by the way, and I'm talking to the police officers who are listening to this,
[02:12:49.739 --> 02:13:00.325]  By the way, all you local officers, you need to go in and get all of your new safety equipment that we're issuing and get your guns checked and make sure that you have your guns and your ammunition all checked and make sure everything's up to date.
[02:13:00.365 --> 02:13:01.085]  We're paying for it.
[02:13:01.105 --> 02:13:01.825]  Don't worry about it.
[02:13:01.886 --> 02:13:02.526]  It's a good penny.
[02:13:02.846 --> 02:13:05.928]  You go in there, they take your gun away from you, and now you are unarmed police officers.
[02:13:06.148 --> 02:13:08.429]  And by the way, we've got an inoculation for you.
[02:13:08.469 --> 02:13:12.631]  They're talking about a national draft for doctors and police to force you to take the shots.
[02:13:12.751 --> 02:13:14.052]  Willie, you're up next.

[02:16:16.354 --> 02:16:18.575]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:16:19.016 --> 02:16:23.359]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:16:23.639 --> 02:16:29.442]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:16:29.683 --> 02:16:33.725]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:16:34.025 --> 02:16:39.669]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[02:16:39.769 --> 02:16:42.391]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:16:44.492 --> 02:16:48.394]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:16:48.434 --> 02:16:50.815]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:16:51.135 --> 02:16:53.456]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:16:53.837 --> 02:16:57.458]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:16:57.939 --> 02:17:04.142]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:17:04.582 --> 02:17:05.542]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:17:05.562 --> 02:17:06.243]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:17:06.283 --> 02:17:06.523]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:17:23.028 --> 02:17:27.930]  Let's go to him quickly.
[02:17:29.010 --> 02:17:32.831]  Willie in Alabama, I guess with an update on the Judge Roy Moore situation.
[02:17:32.851 --> 02:17:33.291]  Go ahead.
[02:17:33.811 --> 02:17:35.252]  Greetings Mr. Jones, Mr. Robert.
[02:17:35.612 --> 02:17:47.595]  Yes sir, I was up there for about three nights and four or five days and I just came back to Mobile to get a break and pass the baton to some other Christians and I wanted to bring you on a little update on what's going on if I may.
[02:17:51.708 --> 02:17:52.009]  The U.S.
[02:17:52.029 --> 02:18:10.825]  Supreme Court, let me see if I can get everything in order here, Chief Justice Roy Moore found out he was suspended by the eight other state Supreme Court Justices on CNN News and he was never served and the other eight won't even let him in his office to get his personal items.
[02:18:12.107 --> 02:18:13.608]  A counter lawsuit has been filed
[02:18:17.809 --> 02:18:20.091]  Kelly McGinley and some others, and I believe you know her.
[02:18:20.171 --> 02:18:23.953]  She has www.retakingamerica.com in Mobile.
[02:18:23.973 --> 02:18:27.515]  I believe you've been interviewed on her program before in Mobile.
[02:18:30.937 --> 02:18:33.758]  There's so much going on up there.
[02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:41.743]  Anyway, we've had great speakers, Dr. Rick Scarborough, Vision America, Howard Phillips, Conservative Caucus.
[02:18:42.284 --> 02:18:45.227]  We've had Ambassador Alan Keyes, who's just been a jewel.
[02:18:45.307 --> 02:18:49.230]  I mean, he's just given so many great patriot speeches up there.
[02:18:49.250 --> 02:18:55.795]  Of course, Jerry Falwell came up and was embracing George W. Bush, but so far I have not seen him yet.
[02:18:56.116 --> 02:18:57.377]  He's not showed up yet.
[02:18:57.577 --> 02:19:01.000]  Thank you, Bush, for appointing all these judges, and this one that's going after more.
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:07.185]  And thank you for Bohemian Grove, and thank you for open borders and gun control, and thank you for being a neocon.
[02:19:07.826 --> 02:19:10.348]  Let me get comments from Colonel Roberts about this.
[02:19:11.039 --> 02:19:24.304]  Well, you know, it goes back to what we were talking about in the beginning, that they have established a system where they've put people on the bench who are going to do everything they can to legislate law from the bench instead of just uphold the law and judge the law.
[02:19:24.344 --> 02:19:26.564]  What they're doing is they're creating law from the bench.
[02:19:26.784 --> 02:19:29.385]  Yeah, I mean, they're saying police can run warrantless checkpoints.
[02:19:29.445 --> 02:19:31.846]  I mean, that's a total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:19:32.326 --> 02:19:32.486]  Right.
[02:19:32.666 --> 02:19:35.147]  When you control the judicial branch and you control the
[02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:39.651]  Uh, executive branch at the same time.
[02:19:39.691 --> 02:19:42.112]  You don't really need a legislative branch anymore.
[02:19:42.673 --> 02:19:44.434]  They're just an obstacle to get around.
[02:19:44.474 --> 02:19:46.816]  Let them go over there and worry about the environment or something.
[02:19:46.856 --> 02:19:49.237]  You know, let them get stirred up about other things.
[02:19:49.297 --> 02:19:55.322]  Meanwhile, we're going to use our judges to pass laws or use precedents from the bench.
[02:19:55.722 --> 02:19:59.985]  That we can go out and do anything we want, including throw the Constitution and the First Amendment out the window.
[02:20:00.402 --> 02:20:05.768]  And so you've got Judge Moore there that's got the Ten Commandments sitting there.
[02:20:06.289 --> 02:20:07.710]  But where does it go from there?
[02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:08.992]  And this is what no one wants to do.
[02:20:09.012 --> 02:20:10.453]  They don't want to think ahead of the jet.
[02:20:10.834 --> 02:20:16.240]  Because where it goes from there is, when do we take the Bibles out of all the public libraries that are run by the government?
[02:20:16.593 --> 02:20:19.214]  When do we take oaths out of our oaths of office?
[02:20:19.334 --> 02:20:20.555]  You know, I mean, how far does this thing go?
[02:20:20.575 --> 02:20:23.356]  Well, Colonel Roberts, I've got a... and thank you, Willie, for the call.
[02:20:23.756 --> 02:20:27.818]  I've got a stack here of news articles where that's already begun.
[02:20:28.058 --> 02:20:28.779]  We'll get to those.
[02:20:29.579 --> 02:20:32.880]  Let's talk to Joe in Oklahoma.
[02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:33.861]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:20:33.881 --> 02:20:34.821]  Hi, Alex.
[02:20:35.261 --> 02:20:35.482]  Hello.
[02:20:35.502 --> 02:20:36.962]  How are you doing today?
[02:20:37.222 --> 02:20:37.683]  I'm doing okay.
[02:20:38.163 --> 02:20:38.903]  Good deal.
[02:20:38.963 --> 02:20:45.266]  I just wanted to bring up something that Colonel Roberts mentioned about the SoBig virus.
[02:20:45.885 --> 02:20:56.929]  That was going through and it's kind of a red herring there because it's a really simple virus that probably any first-year university student that coded.
[02:20:56.949 --> 02:21:05.872]  I've been working in IT for about eight years and it's pretty interesting because if people wanted to get real malicious, you wouldn't even be reading about it.
[02:21:06.012 --> 02:21:07.152]  It'd be so stealthy that
[02:21:08.137 --> 02:21:18.267]  Well, that's the kind of stuff the government's got, and I think Roberts is talking about the scale of it, but go ahead and be specific, exactly what are you saying?
[02:21:21.791 --> 02:21:32.061]  People shouldn't look at this as a malicious attack by a government or by a terrorist organization.
[02:21:32.659 --> 02:21:37.022]  But really more like a kid sitting in his room.
[02:21:37.442 --> 02:21:43.126]  All I was saying is I've read the Chinese newspapers, not somebody saying the Chinese said it.
[02:21:43.226 --> 02:21:54.393]  I've read the Chinese newspapers where they, and supposedly our friends folks, where they say we're the big enemy and they order their college students to launch hack attacks on America.
[02:21:56.514 --> 02:22:01.927]  I think what Craig was saying is that's one of the big culprits of a lot of the mischief we see.
[02:22:02.228 --> 02:22:02.989]  Any comments, Craig?
[02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:11.781]  I can't agree that some kid in high school can do this because I've been in computers for twenty years and I can't do it.
[02:22:12.301 --> 02:22:13.862]  Yeah, I've been in eight and I could.
[02:22:14.142 --> 02:22:15.122]  Well, that may be.
[02:22:15.142 --> 02:22:26.644]  You've had a lot of classes on programming and stuff, but what I'm saying is it cost us over ten billion dollars a day and lost business through the internet because of this virus and the government isn't doing anything about it.
[02:22:26.664 --> 02:22:28.045]  They're not trying to track down who did it.
[02:22:28.205 --> 02:22:29.965]  Yeah, they designed the system.
[02:22:30.005 --> 02:22:33.826]  Look, they gave the communist Chinese last year the Microsoft system.
[02:22:34.186 --> 02:22:34.706]  The code.
[02:22:35.006 --> 02:22:39.488]  Well, why aren't they on the news every night telling us how to defeat this thing?
[02:22:39.508 --> 02:22:41.388]  Because I'm going to tell you right now how to defeat it.
[02:22:41.448 --> 02:22:42.669]  It's real easy to do.
[02:22:42.789 --> 02:22:43.069]  It is.
[02:22:43.549 --> 02:22:44.769]  Okay, well, I'll tell you what.
[02:22:44.849 --> 02:22:46.090]  Stay there, Joe, and stay there, Craig.
[02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:50.992]  We'll get both your takes on how to fix it, and then we'll talk to Darren, Mike, and Pat.
[02:22:51.872 --> 02:22:56.894]  And that's it for calls, because I've got to get to the Philippines news, government-sponsored terror, a bunch of this stuff.
[02:22:57.034 --> 02:22:58.394]  And I want to dig out these articles.
[02:22:58.454 --> 02:23:01.535]  We're all over the country, from Texas to Missouri to California.
[02:23:01.555 --> 02:23:03.176]  They're going after Bibles anywhere now.
[02:23:06.531 --> 02:23:09.532]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:23:10.452 --> 02:23:13.232]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:16.853 --> 02:23:18.494]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:18.834 --> 02:23:24.555]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:23:24.815 --> 02:23:28.196]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world possible.
[02:23:28.416 --> 02:23:30.716]  That's 1-866-962-6272 or visit cobrahead.com.
[02:23:50.234 --> 02:24:09.133]  Welcome back my friends already into the next final segment got about 26 minutes left here and go ahead caller you were you were raising the point of this virus not originating from some government.
[02:24:10.215 --> 02:24:13.438]  Yeah and it just to me it kind of takes people's
[02:24:13.928 --> 02:24:20.030]  You know, attention away from real issues like what's going on in Alabama, California right now and stuff like that.
[02:24:20.050 --> 02:24:20.830]  Speak up a little bit.
[02:24:21.690 --> 02:24:21.910]  Sorry.
[02:24:22.151 --> 02:24:29.413]  It just takes people's attention away from real issues that we have like in Guantanamo Bay and etc.
[02:24:30.033 --> 02:24:34.854]  Kind of a red herring was only the point I was trying to make.
[02:24:34.994 --> 02:24:36.415]  Well, okay, how do you fix it?
[02:24:37.715 --> 02:24:43.057]  The easiest way to fix it, I would go to Symantec.com and they have a removal tool.
[02:24:43.937 --> 02:24:50.621]  Go ahead and change the registry settings and kill the virus and wipe it off your hard drive.
[02:24:51.341 --> 02:24:52.562]  Well, that's if it's on your hard drive.
[02:24:52.582 --> 02:24:59.605]  The problem is, it's not on my hard drive because I clean it every day and I get over 200 emails a day with this junk on it to open the attachment.
[02:24:59.946 --> 02:25:01.466]  And this has been going on for two weeks.
[02:25:01.587 --> 02:25:09.731]  Now, this is coming from, and it also takes my email address and sends it all over the internet making me look like I'm sending it and I have a virus when I don't.
[02:25:09.791 --> 02:25:11.612]  Now, here's how you stop that.
[02:25:12.557 --> 02:25:19.256]  And I can only address the Outlook Express is what I use.
[02:25:20.751 --> 02:25:34.998]  You can go to Tools, go to the Tools at the top in the Outlook Express when you've got your email program open, and then you go from the Tools tab, you go to Message Rules, then you go to Mail, and you're not going to remember this, but just know it's there.
[02:25:35.479 --> 02:25:43.363]  Then Mail Rules, it's just following the progression down until you can click on the rule description, and you can edit in there, you can type in a line that says,
[02:25:43.968 --> 02:25:54.972]  I don't want any more email that says, open the attachment, or I don't want any more email that says, RE your application, or RE thank you, or RE your details.
[02:25:55.012 --> 02:25:57.453]  You know, all of these things that it's using over and over again.
[02:25:57.473 --> 02:26:01.974]  And you can go to Symantec, and you can go to McAfee, and you can get a list of all of these subject headers.
[02:26:02.415 --> 02:26:06.216]  You can type them in there, and from now on, it will weed those out automatically and throw them in the trash.
[02:26:06.436 --> 02:26:12.278]  And it's also a good idea to do that, because that's a common tactic that almost all email viruses use.
[02:26:12.802 --> 02:26:12.922]  Yeah.
[02:26:12.962 --> 02:26:16.365]  And they use a lot of similar subject lines.
[02:26:16.385 --> 02:26:17.025]  Right, right.
[02:26:17.106 --> 02:26:23.871]  And if you learn how to just go in there and set your message rules to delete, you can go subject, you can go who it's from.
[02:26:23.931 --> 02:26:28.995]  If you don't want any more from Uncle John, you can put his name in there and you're not going to get any more.
[02:26:29.015 --> 02:26:31.697]  I don't want any more mortgage ads or Viagra ads.
[02:26:31.777 --> 02:26:32.518]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:32.578 --> 02:26:33.239]  Yeah, same thing.
[02:26:33.379 --> 02:26:38.163]  Alex, I put those in there myself, including a few other I don't even want to mention on the air that keep coming in.
[02:26:38.943 --> 02:26:39.324]  Yeah.
[02:26:40.464 --> 02:26:41.786]  Okay, before we go to
[02:26:43.152 --> 02:26:44.393]  Darren and Mike and Pat.
[02:26:44.413 --> 02:26:45.494]  That'll be our final calls.
[02:26:45.514 --> 02:26:46.615]  Let's get to some news, Colonel.
[02:26:47.316 --> 02:26:47.976]  This is important.
[02:26:47.996 --> 02:26:48.937]  Let me just read this article.
[02:26:49.057 --> 02:26:49.758]  AFP.
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:53.601]  It's a big French newspaper, news service.
[02:26:53.681 --> 02:27:05.412]  Disgruntled rebel Philippine troops claimed a moral victory Monday despite being forced to return, dejected to barracks after their failed military uprising in central Manila.
[02:27:06.664 --> 02:27:21.262]  The young, battle-tested and idealistic military officers and enlisted men reluctantly agreed to end their 22-hour siege and be court-martialed under the authority's degree to consider demands for a probe into allegations of military and government corruption.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:29.004]  We were ready to die, but give up for the sake of our comrades in the military and the interest of the people and the country.
[02:27:29.024 --> 02:27:36.147]  31-year-old Navy officer Antonio Trinales, the self-styled leader of the group, said, we have already planted the seeds.
[02:27:36.187 --> 02:27:39.969]  We will just have to bite the bullet and roll with the punches.
[02:27:40.069 --> 02:27:42.251]  Hopefully, we have inspired others.
[02:27:42.291 --> 02:27:45.112]  This is our significant contribution to the country.
[02:27:45.152 --> 02:27:46.913]  Folks, they could get life in prison or executed.
[02:27:48.476 --> 02:28:01.823]  He said he and his 300-odd men ended their occupation of an upscale apartment and shopping complex in the financial center after intense negotiations with the government, opposition, and military officials.
[02:28:02.443 --> 02:28:15.710]  In the end, sources close to the negotiations said the key figures of the mutiny, whose average age was 27 years old, were largely influenced by colleagues from their alma mater, the Philippine Military Academy, where they belonged to a class renowned for its brilliance and idealism.
[02:28:16.488 --> 02:28:32.619]  Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff, General Narisco Abilla, agreed he would create a special panel to study the complaints raised by the young officers against President Glorio Arroyo's administration in the military.
[02:28:34.221 --> 02:28:43.147]  It goes on to say, Tremnilis, who spoke to Arroyo about his grievances before the revolt, sounded dejected in a local television interview.
[02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:50.793]  And he says, uh, these reforms will not come in my lifetime, he said in a defeat in his voice.
[02:28:51.353 --> 02:29:01.959]  Cornelis had documented the irregularities in the Philippines military in a controversial thesis he submitted for a master's degree at the University of Philippines last year.
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:14.046]  Eugene Gonzalez, another rebel leader, military officer in revolt, was a reminder of the country's leaders to serve with sincerity, adding that his group was prepared to face the music for its action.
[02:29:15.612 --> 02:29:16.412]  And it goes on.
[02:29:17.333 --> 02:29:18.093]  Now, here it is.
[02:29:18.253 --> 02:29:33.639]  They accuse the military leadership of selling arms to rebels from the country's biggest separatist Muslim group, the Islamic Liberation Front, or MILF, the communist guerrilla force of New People's Army, and the notorious Abu Sayyaf Kingpin.
[02:29:34.562 --> 02:29:36.103]  Kidnap for Ransom Groot.
[02:29:36.364 --> 02:29:49.956]  The mutineers also who colleagues say also hold a sterling combat record said they had come across recovered ammunition from captured rebel camps with markings DND Department of National Defense arsenal.
[02:29:50.476 --> 02:29:58.525]  These bullets are some of the same ones that are killing our fellow soldiers in the field, complained Captain Renardo Gambila, another Corps leader of the siege.
[02:29:58.585 --> 02:30:06.313]  The Ministry has also accused Defense Secretary Angelo Reyes and Military Intelligence Chief of masterminding bombings against civilian targets.
[02:30:06.873 --> 02:30:12.157]  In the southern Philippines in a bid to declare the MILF a terrorist group and eventually get more U.S.
[02:30:12.177 --> 02:30:14.418]  funding for the anti-terror campaign.
[02:30:14.438 --> 02:30:21.503]  They also accused the military leadership of planning bombings in Manila in a bid to extend O'Reilly's stay in power through martial law.
[02:30:21.843 --> 02:30:36.273]  They will also do this through bombings in Metro Milan, which they will blame on other groups, said Gambalala, citing the recent escape of self-confessed Indonesian terrorist father
[02:30:37.102 --> 02:30:37.602]  We're good.
[02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:56.641]  That's just the beginning.
[02:30:56.682 --> 02:31:06.254]  I can't babble through all this in the interest of time, but Colonel Roberts, I mean, how many times do we have to catch Mossad, MI6, CIA blowing stuff up?
[02:31:06.435 --> 02:31:09.038]  I mean, it's just so obvious what they're doing.
[02:31:09.439 --> 02:31:11.722]  Well, and it is, and it's not the first time.
[02:31:12.262 --> 02:31:23.685]  And it's probably going to continue on because it's kind of a modus operandi for anybody in the intelligence segment to be able to initiate an action so that they can have a counteraction to it.
[02:31:23.745 --> 02:31:26.606]  So they can justify spending more money or bringing in more troops.
[02:31:27.026 --> 02:31:32.267]  And this whole thing is pointing toward us putting American forces back into the Philippines.
[02:31:32.287 --> 02:31:33.828]  And we've been there several times before.
[02:31:33.908 --> 02:31:35.028]  In fact, we just pulled out.
[02:31:35.048 --> 02:31:41.370]  We just gave them Clark Air Base and the Naval Station back.
[02:31:42.329 --> 02:31:47.051]  And all of a sudden, here we've got this, that they're saying, we need American money, we need American troops.
[02:31:47.391 --> 02:31:50.012]  And we're starting to send special forces guys over there.
[02:31:50.812 --> 02:31:52.012]  Now, we've always had them over there.
[02:31:52.072 --> 02:31:53.293]  Colonel Nick Rau was over there.
[02:31:53.353 --> 02:31:58.594]  And Colonel Rau was, if you remember him, he was in Vietnam, I think as a lieutenant, was captured by the Viet Cong.
[02:31:58.635 --> 02:32:01.335]  He was one of the few people that escaped and actually got away.
[02:32:01.355 --> 02:32:03.716]  He'd been there, I mean, they had him in a cage for several months.
[02:32:04.316 --> 02:32:05.737]  And he actually escaped and got away.
[02:32:06.784 --> 02:32:09.286]  What's wrong with being in a cage with mosquitoes and rats?
[02:32:09.766 --> 02:32:12.629]  We do that to the people at Camp X-Ray.
[02:32:12.649 --> 02:32:13.589]  Is that a loving thing?
[02:32:13.609 --> 02:32:14.850]  Well, I didn't say anything wrong with it.
[02:32:14.890 --> 02:32:16.772]  I just said I would rather have a nicer house than that.
[02:32:17.272 --> 02:32:18.513]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:32:18.753 --> 02:32:20.755]  This is a horrible form of torture.
[02:32:20.775 --> 02:32:22.757]  Nick Rowe, though, was in the Philippines, Special Forces.
[02:32:22.817 --> 02:32:23.337]  Good guy.
[02:32:23.737 --> 02:32:25.699]  And he gets ambushed one day.
[02:32:25.719 --> 02:32:28.321]  I think it was in Manila or near Manila.
[02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:41.675]  He's in a van, and a gorilla's come up, and I can't remember if they shot him or threw a bomb in the van or what it was, but anyway, he was assassinated over there because he was starting to make waves on this very connection that, hey, there's a problem here.
[02:32:41.715 --> 02:32:49.484]  We got people inside the Philippine government who are supplying the rebels, who are supplying the different Islamic factions and so on.
[02:32:49.884 --> 02:32:50.244]  Like that.
[02:32:50.364 --> 02:32:53.407]  Now, we take it a step further and we look at the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:32:53.447 --> 02:33:05.255]  We've got Abu Sayyaf involved in that because I've got a file from the Philippine government that shows that Nichols and McVeigh, especially Nichols, went to the Philippines several times, met with Abu Sayyaf.
[02:33:05.295 --> 02:33:08.537]  Now, who he met with Abu Sayyaf, and we've discussed this in the past,
[02:33:09.017 --> 02:33:14.120]  He met with Ramsey Yosef, who was later one of the World Trade Center bombers.
[02:33:14.420 --> 02:33:19.563]  He met with a guy named Mohammed Wali Khan, who was Osama Bin Laden's left-hand man.
[02:33:19.823 --> 02:33:21.625]  And he met with a guy named Edwin Angeles.
[02:33:21.665 --> 02:33:28.909]  Now this is where the point I'm trying to make now is Edwin Angeles was the second commander of Abu Sayyaf, but Edwin Angeles was a member of the
[02:33:29.710 --> 02:33:31.631]  Philippine Secret Intelligence Service.
[02:33:31.671 --> 02:33:32.572]  He was a plant.
[02:33:33.253 --> 02:33:36.516]  But he helped start Abu Sayyaf.
[02:33:36.576 --> 02:33:37.897]  Well, it's the same thing in England.
[02:33:38.478 --> 02:33:41.941]  MI5 runs the terror groups, Protestant and Catholic.
[02:33:42.222 --> 02:33:43.323]  They're blowing things up.
[02:33:43.383 --> 02:33:44.864]  It's not that they're infiltrated.
[02:33:45.124 --> 02:33:45.785]  They run it.
[02:33:46.145 --> 02:33:50.510]  And British intelligence goes around kneecapping people if they won't start riots.
[02:33:50.570 --> 02:33:51.831]  I mean, it's controlled by them.
[02:33:53.142 --> 02:33:54.964]  Well, let's go back to the 1700s.
[02:33:55.024 --> 02:33:55.764]  It's the same thing.
[02:33:55.924 --> 02:34:04.971]  If you can stir up the people against an organization or against a government, then you can either take over the organization or the government by using the people.
[02:34:06.032 --> 02:34:07.072]  So you do that in the Philippines.
[02:34:07.092 --> 02:34:08.233]  You go around and blow up a few things.
[02:34:08.253 --> 02:34:09.234]  You blame it on somebody.
[02:34:09.274 --> 02:34:09.814]  Hitler did it.
[02:34:09.834 --> 02:34:10.355]  It worked for him.
[02:34:11.218 --> 02:34:12.519]  And I think that's what we're seeing.
[02:34:12.559 --> 02:34:21.603]  So now you've got Philippine military personnel who are saying, you know, we found out that we're supplying the enemy and we're blowing up our own stuff and we're not putting up with it anymore.
[02:34:21.623 --> 02:34:26.265]  It's about time we had a little discussion with this government at Bandit Point, and that's where the insurrection came from.
[02:34:28.406 --> 02:34:33.628]  And then they gave themselves up to be put in prison for the rest of their lives.
[02:34:34.428 --> 02:34:38.550]  And they'll probably be killed in prison by communists who are openly working for the government.
[02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:40.511]  I mean, I've had leftist anarchists
[02:34:41.078 --> 02:34:42.699]  Who aren't, again, anarchists at all.
[02:34:42.919 --> 02:34:43.439]  They're leftists.
[02:34:43.479 --> 02:34:48.762]  Walk over to me at a rally, admit they work for the feds, and say that we can kill you anytime we want.
[02:34:49.662 --> 02:34:54.385]  Yeah, that, they, uh, sometimes they get a little brazen.
[02:34:54.965 --> 02:35:04.090]  I understand, but my point is, is that these so-called leftists out in the streets, who are against the wars and all this, they're there to make anti-war look stupid.
[02:35:04.830 --> 02:35:07.792]  They're there to control the debate and make the left look like it's good.
[02:35:08.442 --> 02:35:09.442]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:35:09.662 --> 02:35:11.903]  And what we're seeing, though, is all of this stuff.
[02:35:11.963 --> 02:35:24.625]  It doesn't matter whether it's right-wing or left-wing, it's all going in the same direction right now, and it's all being controlled by the globalists for one purpose, and that is to pull all of this stuff together to accomplish their little new world order scenario.
[02:35:24.645 --> 02:35:25.285]  Well, it's simple.
[02:35:25.325 --> 02:35:37.648]  There's going to be more and more bombings, more and more terror, and the government gets bigger and bigger with more controls over our lives, and now everything's going to be a terrorist action, and it's just the excuse for the government to run our lives.
[02:35:37.748 --> 02:35:46.898]  Well, there's the next step, and when you go to the Gulag Acapulago by Alexander Solzhenitsyn and you start looking at it, we're seeing a blueprint that was done there happening here now.
[02:35:47.359 --> 02:35:54.006]  The next step is going to be terrorizing the population so badly that we're afraid to leave our houses.
[02:35:54.346 --> 02:35:55.846]  We're afraid to say anything.
[02:35:56.066 --> 02:35:58.107]  We're afraid to have radio shows like this.
[02:35:58.427 --> 02:36:01.767]  We're afraid to do anything, because we don't want to be labeled a terrorist.
[02:36:01.807 --> 02:36:03.488]  We don't want to be labeled a criminal.
[02:36:03.528 --> 02:36:06.268]  We don't want anybody picking us up in the middle of the night.
[02:36:06.308 --> 02:36:07.768]  And that's where this is going right now.
[02:36:08.188 --> 02:36:11.769]  To protect you from yourself, we have to destroy you, basically.
[02:36:12.069 --> 02:36:13.629]  You know, it's the old Vietnam deal.
[02:36:13.949 --> 02:36:15.690]  To save the village, we had to destroy it.
[02:36:16.470 --> 02:36:20.871]  And their deal is to order out of chaos, and it's also to control by terror.
[02:36:21.051 --> 02:36:22.211]  Craig, we're not Russia.
[02:36:22.251 --> 02:36:23.071]  We're not China.
[02:36:24.013 --> 02:36:30.618]  We're not Cuba, and the key is we're being more vocal, we're being more active, more people are waking up.
[02:36:30.638 --> 02:36:35.701]  You talk about how you go to the deer camp and ten years ago two cops out of thirty knew, now almost all of you know.
[02:36:36.442 --> 02:36:44.607]  Don't you see it that we have a good chance if folks are active of standing up and not being cowed into submission and defeating this?
[02:36:44.887 --> 02:36:49.691]  I think it's happening more and more every day, but it only happens because we keep gas in our tanks.
[02:36:50.551 --> 02:37:04.103]  You know, the day we quit talking, the day we quit having these radio shows and publishing these books and doing these videos, and the day we quit doing the seminars and traveling, and just decide, I'm just going to pass the torch on to somebody else, I'm going to kick back in my lawn chair.
[02:37:04.143 --> 02:37:07.746]  Yeah, folks, they spend a lot of time figuring out how to counter real patriots.
[02:37:08.106 --> 02:37:09.307]  We're on the threat board.
[02:37:09.607 --> 02:37:13.611]  You can see their propaganda in the news, the newspapers, the sitcoms, the dramas.
[02:37:14.309 --> 02:37:18.452]  You know, the episodes where it's all anti-gun messages?
[02:37:18.852 --> 02:37:21.935]  They're trying to counter us, and they know they're losing credibility.
[02:37:22.135 --> 02:37:23.776]  The polls have come out, Colonel.
[02:37:24.196 --> 02:37:27.279]  The mainstream news is losing almost all its credibility.
[02:37:27.659 --> 02:37:31.002]  Well, it was going to happen sooner or later, because people aren't totally stupid.
[02:37:31.042 --> 02:37:36.766]  People do have the ability to become educated, and once they do, you can't uneducate them.
[02:37:37.156 --> 02:37:38.657]  And that's the problem we're running into.
[02:37:38.697 --> 02:37:40.357]  They've tried to control the youth.
[02:37:40.377 --> 02:37:42.198]  They've tried to control the educational system.
[02:37:42.238 --> 02:37:45.119]  They've tried to control the religious systems in this country.
[02:37:45.439 --> 02:37:47.059]  They've tried to control the media.
[02:37:47.099 --> 02:37:50.100]  But the problem is, Americans are a different breed of cat.
[02:37:50.741 --> 02:37:55.042]  We don't fall in the same groove as the other people who line up in a row and turn in their guns.
[02:37:55.062 --> 02:37:56.242]  That's why we're more violent.
[02:37:56.262 --> 02:38:03.745]  That's why we have more... I mean, there's problems on that, but there's also pluses to ban a bunch of wild folks from all over the place.
[02:38:04.185 --> 02:38:04.885]  Right.
[02:38:04.905 --> 02:38:06.366]  You're not ever going to be able to
[02:38:07.065 --> 02:38:08.306]  You know, kill all the fish in the sea.
[02:38:08.346 --> 02:38:09.346]  It just isn't going to happen.
[02:38:10.947 --> 02:38:12.208]  But now it's a battle.
[02:38:12.268 --> 02:38:13.109]  It's a war.
[02:38:13.149 --> 02:38:14.689]  And it's an information war right now.
[02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:15.710]  It's an education war.
[02:38:15.770 --> 02:38:18.132]  It's where we have to get other people on board.
[02:38:18.172 --> 02:38:19.572]  We have to make them see the truth.
[02:38:19.632 --> 02:38:20.153]  See the light.
[02:38:20.193 --> 02:38:21.053]  See what's going on.
[02:38:21.654 --> 02:38:23.134]  And then stand up against it.
[02:38:23.295 --> 02:38:25.016]  Do it at the ballot box.
[02:38:25.056 --> 02:38:26.697]  Do it on the soap box.
[02:38:26.737 --> 02:38:27.237]  I don't care.
[02:38:27.797 --> 02:38:32.240]  But, you know, people at my church ask me, well, you know, we really need some leadership.
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:33.921]  We really need somebody to do something.
[02:38:33.941 --> 02:38:35.522]  And I said, let me tell you something.
[02:38:35.842 --> 02:38:36.322]  No, you don't.
[02:38:36.342 --> 02:38:37.943]  You need yourself to do something.
[02:38:37.983 --> 02:38:39.284]  Because I do radio shows.
[02:38:39.424 --> 02:38:40.104]  I write books.
[02:38:40.224 --> 02:38:42.225]  I put my head on a chopping block all the time.
[02:38:42.566 --> 02:38:51.771]  You know, I... Yeah, Carl, in Vietnam, when you were out there as a sniper, I mean, I mean, it's not, you know, the general's going to save me back in the command bunker.
[02:38:52.455 --> 02:38:52.896]  No, no.
[02:38:52.956 --> 02:38:54.657]  What we need is we need the troops on the line.
[02:38:54.717 --> 02:38:56.459]  We need the people in the Sunday school classes.
[02:38:56.499 --> 02:38:57.781]  We need the people at the bus stop.
[02:38:57.821 --> 02:39:00.964]  We need the people on the street to educate the guy standing next to them.
[02:39:01.745 --> 02:39:09.591]  Well look, ten years ago I was in college here and how evil America was, and I got sick of hearing their anti-gun, anti-family garbage, and I got on this path.
[02:39:09.951 --> 02:39:12.913]  You, you know, fifteen, twenty years ago began investigating it.
[02:39:13.234 --> 02:39:14.254]  You found out about it.
[02:39:14.555 --> 02:39:15.695]  I mean, it's simple, folks.
[02:39:15.755 --> 02:39:17.016]  You've all got to be leaders.
[02:39:17.317 --> 02:39:21.239]  There are people more articulate, more intelligent, with more resources than us.
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:25.683]  And I'm telling you, if you don't get involved, folks, we're going to lose it all.
[02:39:26.443 --> 02:39:28.705]  The globalists are the sickest, most ruthless
[02:39:29.563 --> 02:39:44.008]  Synthesis of wickedness I have ever even tried to study or imagine and it's their nature and you better stop being naive and you better admit that there is a devil because that's the devil's biggest trick is convincing the world he didn't exist.
[02:39:44.288 --> 02:39:47.008]  That's how Ted Bundy got women in that Volkswagen.
[02:39:47.589 --> 02:39:47.969]  Okay?
[02:39:48.449 --> 02:39:55.411]  There's two kinds of people in the world folks and that's meat eaters and grass eaters and you've got to figure out which one you are because the meat eaters eat the grass eaters.
[02:39:55.991 --> 02:39:58.372]  And there's two types of birds, eagles and ostriches.
[02:39:58.968 --> 02:40:03.029]  And if you're not an eagle, you've got your head in the sand and somebody's going to come along and tick what's sticking up.
[02:40:03.249 --> 02:40:04.490]  Well, I do a varying of that.
[02:40:04.530 --> 02:40:06.450]  You've got wolves, sheep, and sheep dogs.
[02:40:06.951 --> 02:40:07.551]  I'm not a wolf.
[02:40:07.591 --> 02:40:08.231]  I'm not a sheep.
[02:40:08.951 --> 02:40:11.452]  And I have this instinctive need to warn these people.
[02:40:14.113 --> 02:40:16.313]  Let's talk to Darren in Colorado.
[02:40:16.333 --> 02:40:17.054]  Go ahead, Darren.
[02:40:17.794 --> 02:40:18.534]  Good day, gentlemen.
[02:40:18.574 --> 02:40:22.075]  It's a distinct and profound pleasure to be with you today.
[02:40:22.115 --> 02:40:23.216]  Well, it's an honor to talk to you.
[02:40:23.256 --> 02:40:23.576]  Go ahead.
[02:40:25.069 --> 02:40:28.852]  Mr. Roberts, have you ever heard of a former military man named Jim Ammerman?
[02:40:29.293 --> 02:40:29.573]  Oh, yes.
[02:40:29.933 --> 02:40:32.215]  Yeah, I think he's a wonderful speaker.
[02:40:32.436 --> 02:40:37.580]  And Alex, if you could ever speak with him on your show, I'm sure we'd all be delighted to hear it.
[02:40:39.882 --> 02:40:49.170]  I'd like to thank you, Alex, for bringing up that commercial that ran a few years ago with the guy in the overcoat filling his pockets and walking out and being stopped to have his receipt handed to him.
[02:40:49.210 --> 02:40:51.012]  I'd forgotten completely about that.
[02:40:51.829 --> 02:40:53.730]  And I appreciate you reminding me of that.
[02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:56.972]  Well, that's what the self-checkout is with the RFID.
[02:40:57.372 --> 02:40:59.153]  It's admitted to get rid of all the checkers.
[02:40:59.593 --> 02:41:05.876]  And then, like you said, they weren't selling anything except that they're putting forth this image of things to come.
[02:41:07.337 --> 02:41:14.561]  Alex, the one thing I wanted to ask you, my dad, his name was David Waters, and he was from Austin, Texas, where you're at.
[02:41:15.433 --> 02:41:24.979]  And he killed Madeleine Marie O'Hare, and I've read as much as I could about that case, and is there anything that I should know that maybe you'd be privy to from being from that area?
[02:41:24.999 --> 02:41:27.441]  Because I know it was covered more thoroughly in Austin.
[02:41:27.461 --> 02:41:32.484]  You're going to have to stay there, Darren, because I'll talk to you on the other side.
[02:41:32.584 --> 02:41:33.285]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:34.756 --> 02:41:39.078]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:39.258 --> 02:41:43.700]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:48.222]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:48.242 --> 02:41:49.603]  The New World Order.
[02:41:51.392 --> 02:41:55.617]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:55.677 --> 02:42:02.606]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:02.747 --> 02:42:04.749]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:05.350 --> 02:42:05.810]  We're good to go.
[02:42:34.045 --> 02:42:40.449]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:42:40.609 --> 02:42:46.953]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:42:47.254 --> 02:42:55.999]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:42:56.239 --> 02:43:03.444]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:43:03.744 --> 02:43:08.666]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:43:08.886 --> 02:43:14.427]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:43:14.747 --> 02:43:17.908]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:43:18.248 --> 02:43:26.371]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:43:26.411 --> 02:43:27.011]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:43:33.953 --> 02:43:38.594]  Have you been tricked into believing that you can't hire or be hired without a social security number?
[02:43:38.774 --> 02:43:44.736]  You think that you can't bank, get a driver's license, or rent an apartment, or get insurance without a social security number?
[02:43:44.916 --> 02:43:47.756]  It seems everywhere you turn, somebody is asking for it.
[02:43:47.896 --> 02:43:55.278]  But did you know there is no law requiring you to obtain, have, or use a social security number to live or work in the United States?
[02:43:55.498 --> 02:44:03.970]  The Social Security Number Not Required Policy Manual from Nonumber.com tells you how to assert your rights and live free as an unenumerated American.

[02:44:41.363 --> 02:44:42.524]  All right.
[02:44:44.306 --> 02:44:45.668]  Darren in Colorado.
[02:44:45.688 --> 02:44:48.591]  If you want to contact me sometime off air, email me or something.
[02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:53.281]  I'll try to sift through and find it and get in touch with you.
[02:44:53.481 --> 02:45:03.325]  But, I mean, the whole Madeleine Marie O'Hair case and how she was supposedly killed and then all that investigation went along, I don't know what to make of it.
[02:45:03.365 --> 02:45:04.605]  I don't know what the truth is.
[02:45:05.186 --> 02:45:12.428]  And you probably know more about that than I do, but you're saying your father was the convicted, I mean, is the convicted killer?
[02:45:12.929 --> 02:45:13.469]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:13.569 --> 02:45:15.750]  He died in January.
[02:45:16.390 --> 02:45:19.371]  Just all of a sudden, he'd been put in Leavenworth.
[02:45:20.478 --> 02:45:22.940]  And suddenly he was deathly ill and died within a month.
[02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:25.742]  And it was very strange.
[02:45:25.802 --> 02:45:36.290]  It struck me as strange that a perfectly healthy man would just suddenly... Yeah, that whole case was, they were out there at that ranch for months.
[02:45:36.310 --> 02:45:37.391]  Then, oh, they found something.
[02:45:37.431 --> 02:45:38.131]  Oh, they hadn't.
[02:45:38.191 --> 02:45:48.219]  And just the way that the whole thing was being reported, it was very, very interesting.
[02:45:48.945 --> 02:45:52.807]  Yeah, he was in Leavenworth, struck deathly ill all of a sudden.
[02:45:53.107 --> 02:45:59.531]  They shipped him off to North Carolina to their federal cancer brig or whatever they've got.
[02:45:59.691 --> 02:46:04.734]  I know they do a lot of bio and chemical testing on prisoners and people, and that's admitted.
[02:46:04.754 --> 02:46:09.996]  They did it to troops, even in the mid-80s, in England, killing our troops knowingly.
[02:46:10.016 --> 02:46:10.857]  That's BBC.
[02:46:11.617 --> 02:46:13.038]  Colonel Roberts, can you speak to that?
[02:46:14.879 --> 02:46:17.480]  You know, I'm real familiar with the O'Hare case.
[02:46:19.165 --> 02:46:20.025]  I don't know exactly.
[02:46:20.066 --> 02:46:27.629]  I don't know anything about what you're talking about right now, but I know that there's also a lot of money involved in this deal.
[02:46:28.369 --> 02:46:32.051]  And all the money disappeared, and there's a lot of gold involved, and all the gold disappeared.
[02:46:32.451 --> 02:46:33.771]  And it all happened like overnight.
[02:46:33.851 --> 02:46:35.312]  I don't know if they ever found any of that.
[02:46:35.412 --> 02:46:37.233]  So, other than that, I really don't know much about it.
[02:46:37.733 --> 02:46:38.994]  Yeah, send me some info.
[02:46:39.174 --> 02:46:40.254]  I appreciate the call, Darren.
[02:46:40.534 --> 02:46:41.815]  Mike in Tennessee, real quick.
[02:46:41.875 --> 02:46:42.335]  Go ahead.
[02:46:42.355 --> 02:46:46.717]  Appreciate you coming on the show, Mike.
[02:46:48.698 --> 02:46:49.338]  Okay.
[02:46:49.938 --> 02:46:50.219]  Hello?
[02:46:50.939 --> 02:46:51.499]  Go ahead.
[02:46:51.959 --> 02:46:52.259]  I'm here.
[02:46:52.279 --> 02:46:53.660]  Go ahead and talk.
[02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:54.340]  Okay.
[02:46:55.300 --> 02:46:59.462]  So, Robert, I've enjoyed all three of your books, and your newest one was Walking Dead.
[02:46:59.482 --> 02:47:02.583]  Is that the latest one?
[02:47:02.603 --> 02:47:06.264]  That's a reprinted one that came out several years ago, but it's just come back out again.
[02:47:06.704 --> 02:47:06.944]  Okay.
[02:47:07.365 --> 02:47:12.767]  Now, you mentioned something earlier about a radar shot from Long Island that showed
[02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:15.521]  Yeah, your phone's bad.
[02:47:15.541 --> 02:47:17.262]  I'm going to have to let you go, Mike.
[02:47:17.302 --> 02:47:17.923]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:18.563 --> 02:47:24.508]  Craig, other comments on the power outage and the EMP burst that you emailed to me that I'll be posting on Infowars.com?
[02:47:24.648 --> 02:47:27.731]  Yeah, I don't know much more than what we're going to see there, but something we need to look at.
[02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:32.134]  But before we run out of time, there is one last thing, and I want them to know they heard it here first.
[02:47:32.655 --> 02:47:36.518]  I just got this in, and I already knew something about this, but I just got some confirmation about it.
[02:47:37.142 --> 02:47:45.948]  Start watching between now and election time for bio-warfare bunkers to be discovered in the western desert of Iraq.
[02:47:46.008 --> 02:47:52.111]  There's evidently two, and I knew about one, but there's evidently two underground bunkers in the western desert of Iraq.
[02:47:52.151 --> 02:47:54.573]  And now they're claiming there's one also in Lebanon.
[02:47:55.193 --> 02:47:56.934]  Well, these two right now, we know about them.
[02:47:56.954 --> 02:48:01.157]  We knew about them a long time ago, and you and I discussed why haven't they just gone and shown that, hey, here they are.
[02:48:01.696 --> 02:48:02.917]  Well, they would lose effect.
[02:48:03.798 --> 02:48:07.260]  If you can find them just before the election, of course, it would make a big difference.
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:10.943]  Well, I've even heard Limbaugh brag that they've already found it, and they're going to be showing it to people.
[02:48:10.963 --> 02:48:16.127]  Of course, also, they've got to go into them first and clean them out, because a lot of them have U.S.-made chemicals in them.
[02:48:16.367 --> 02:48:18.508]  Well, I don't know about these two right here.
[02:48:18.548 --> 02:48:21.030]  We were watching these ten years ago that I know of.
[02:48:21.271 --> 02:48:21.891]  At least one of them.
[02:48:21.911 --> 02:48:22.932]  It's inside of a mountain.
[02:48:23.012 --> 02:48:23.872]  It's been hollowed out.
[02:48:23.932 --> 02:48:29.797]  The other one is under the desert, where they dug it at nighttime, not realizing that we had satellites to see at night.
[02:48:30.397 --> 02:48:30.998]  Absolutely.
[02:48:31.338 --> 02:48:33.440]  Pat, last caller, go ahead real quick.
[02:48:34.441 --> 02:48:36.262]  Okay, Pat, we're not going to have time to go to Pat.
[02:48:36.663 --> 02:48:38.084]  I'm out of time, folks.
