[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.326]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:15.331]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:17.073]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.773 --> 00:00:18.894]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:20.355]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:22.016]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:26.298]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:30.981]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:39.126]  Telling it like it is!
[00:00:40.345 --> 00:00:43.686]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:45.347]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:46.287 --> 00:00:49.868]  Central Standard Time, then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:00:50.109 --> 00:01:02.293]  I'm Alex Jones, blasting out on the AM and FM dial, simulcasting at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and on the global shortwave during the day at 12.172, at 93.20, and at night at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:20.744]  We've got an award-winning journalist joining us, national television host as well, from Canada who believes the globalists are covering up what really happened on 9-1-1.
[00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:28.809]  So there are thousands of prominent people in the media telling the truth globally, hundreds of them in this country and Canada.
[00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:31.331]  It's coming up today!
[00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:37.495]  In the second hour, we're also going to have wide open phones throughout the broadcast day.
[00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:38.736]  It is Thursday.
[00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:56.019]  And of course, coming up this Saturday, I'm going to be in Kansas City with Colonel Craig Roberts, Ralph Epperson, and others, John Stapmiller, giving presentations up in Kansas City at the Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center.
[00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:58.780]  More details of that coming up later in the show.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.483]  And tomorrow, I've got Dr. Dennis Cuddy joining us as well.
[00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:08.816]  Local companies' employees die in Saudi bombing.
[00:02:08.856 --> 00:02:11.339]  Now, I had this on InfoWars.com yesterday.
[00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.740]  I briefly mentioned it.
[00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:19.387]  I said two days ago, before it was even in the news, on my website, and it's posted.
[00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:25.934]  The headline, you saw it, where I said, hmm, I bet the Carlisle Group is going to be involved.
[00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:28.196]  I bet they're involved in the rebuilding.
[00:02:29.207 --> 00:02:30.508]  Well, guess what?
[00:02:31.108 --> 00:02:37.890]  Guess who owned the company and had just gotten done selling it and still had connections to it as a subsidiary?
[00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:41.191]  The Carlisle Group.
[00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:44.052]  The Bin Ladens, the Bushes, and the rest of them.
[00:02:44.713 --> 00:02:47.654]  Local companies' employees die in Saudi bombing.
[00:02:47.694 --> 00:02:49.094]  This is from NBC News.
[00:02:49.974 --> 00:02:54.296]  And it turns out, talking about Saudi Arabia, Riyadh, the bombing a couple days ago,
[00:02:55.791 --> 00:03:06.476]  Turns out that 50 plus of the 70 employees were gone on a training mission, and now we're finding out that Halliburton and others had warned people.
[00:03:06.796 --> 00:03:09.017]  Oh, so we trust them so much now.
[00:03:09.037 --> 00:03:09.998]  They warned us.
[00:03:10.078 --> 00:03:13.419]  They warned us of attacks in New York.
[00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.940]  They warned us over and over again.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.804]  Turns out the hijackers had their houses and cars paid for by the FBI and an FBI living with them, but hey, they didn't have any prior knowledge.
[00:03:24.793 --> 00:03:30.118]  So it's all on InfoWars.com, being updated right now for you to go check out.
[00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.982]  But the stories I just mentioned were up there yesterday for you, I just didn't spend time on it.
[00:03:34.883 --> 00:03:38.247]  Turns out the firm was a cover for the CIA too!
[00:03:38.527 --> 00:03:41.290]  Oh, lo and behold, what got bombed was the CIA.
[00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.352]  This is the Times of London.
[00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:51.847]  And, uh, the Vanell's one-time owners, the Carlyle Group, uh, shadowy CIA operations.
[00:03:52.288 --> 00:04:00.818]  Here are the mainstream articles, NBC and the Times of London, on the website, InfoWars.com, right now.
[00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:06.124]  Also, officials who failed to put hijackers on watch lists, not named.
[00:04:06.504 --> 00:04:14.370]  Tenet won't explain why these people were known terrorists, the supposed hijackers, the patsies, but they just kept them off all the watch lists.
[00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.893]  But if you've ever been caught with a small amount of marijuana on a flight or internationally, you're on the watch list.
[00:04:19.913 --> 00:04:20.834]  You never come off of it.
[00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.816]  That turns out a lot of them have been taken off the watch list.
[00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:30.841]  Of course, they've been followed out of the country by the CIA to meetings they had in Malaysia and back in.
[00:04:31.798 --> 00:04:32.058]  U.S.
[00:04:32.158 --> 00:04:34.840]  asked Saudis to increase security right before the attacks.
[00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:36.221]  Also U.S.
[00:04:36.261 --> 00:04:38.803]  Ambassador says Saudis didn't need security requests.
[00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:41.545]  Bodies of 18 immigrants found in truck in Texas.
[00:04:42.026 --> 00:04:44.247]  Giant 18 wheelers packed full of illegal aliens.
[00:04:45.148 --> 00:04:46.529]  Bunch of them dead inside.
[00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:47.370]  We'll talk about that.
[00:04:48.564 --> 00:04:51.708]  Mexicans send a record amount home as our economy shuts down.
[00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.872]  Also, Joseph Farah talks about the growing threat of fascism.
[00:04:56.193 --> 00:04:58.255]  We'll talk about the imploding economy.
[00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:01.378]  The jobs are even leaving Mexico and going to China.
[00:05:01.398 --> 00:05:02.339]  We're really in trouble.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.905]  It's just, folks, it's an absolute shotgun of key information.
[00:05:07.325 --> 00:05:07.946]  Stay with me.
[00:05:08.206 --> 00:05:08.687]  Stay with me.
[00:05:11.997 --> 00:05:15.621]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:20.166]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:24.811]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:27.955]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:32.857]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:37.058]  Made of the finest materials, it has a 2-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[00:05:37.298 --> 00:05:39.679]  And the aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.841]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:49.243]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[00:05:49.503 --> 00:05:52.424]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[00:05:52.584 --> 00:05:54.445]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:57.327]  For more information about the Aeronizer, call Toll Free.
[00:05:57.567 --> 00:05:59.348]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[00:05:59.508 --> 00:06:00.728]  The Toll Free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[00:06:00.748 --> 00:06:00.948]  That's 877-605-9200.
[00:06:01.008 --> 00:06:02.909]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:06:13.755 --> 00:06:15.037]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:06:15.237 --> 00:06:20.983]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:06:21.264 --> 00:06:26.530]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.935]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:06:31.195 --> 00:06:34.917]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:06:35.178 --> 00:06:39.801]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:46.165]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:48.026]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:06:48.506 --> 00:06:50.589]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:08.347]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:07:09.213 --> 00:07:13.176]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[00:07:13.637 --> 00:07:20.683]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.
[00:07:21.063 --> 00:07:25.166]  With an ozone generator, you can kill bacteria and viruses in your drinking water.
[00:07:25.687 --> 00:07:28.949]  Get rid of that stale air in your house that keeps recirculating.
[00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.154]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[00:07:34.634 --> 00:07:39.297]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises for one of the most affordable ozone generators available today.
[00:07:39.717 --> 00:07:41.138]  That number is 800-569-4340.
[00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:52.044]  The ozone generator is portable, has an internal blower for ozone disbursement into the air, and comes with a tube attachment for ozonating liquids.
[00:07:52.444 --> 00:07:53.805]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[00:07:54.165 --> 00:07:57.746]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.
[00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:07.450]  So call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your personal ozone generator or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[00:08:14.657 --> 00:08:15.318]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:16.999]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:18.880]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.501 --> 00:08:20.321]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.062 --> 00:08:22.022]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.643 --> 00:08:26.526]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:30.949]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.871 --> 00:08:37.994]  Welcome back to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:42.871]  I'm Alex Jones, briefly recapping some of what's coming up in today's broadcast.
[00:08:43.351 --> 00:08:54.500]  We have an award-winning journalist, syndicated columnist, television host, commentator, who is on television in Canada, who says the globalists are involved in 9-1-1.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.421]  No kidding!
[00:08:56.081 --> 00:09:02.746]  And he's so respected, he's got a lot of people listening to him, not just in Canada, but around the world.
[00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:06.813]  A lot more people standing up and telling it like it is.
[00:09:06.853 --> 00:09:16.183]  You have prominent voices, frankly, probably more prominent than I. We are multiplying rapidly and the globalists know it.
[00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:22.491]  Turns out the Carlisle Group and the CIA were involved in every way, including ownership as a front.
[00:09:23.084 --> 00:09:28.348]  With the buildings that got bombed over in Saudi Arabia.
[00:09:28.508 --> 00:09:32.050]  And day one, I put on my website, I said, will the Carlyle Group be involved?
[00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.311]  Will they rebuild the building?
[00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:36.794]  Because the Bin Ladens always rebuild the buildings that get bombed.
[00:09:37.034 --> 00:09:38.555]  They get the contracts to rebuild them.
[00:09:40.251 --> 00:09:42.073]  Very interesting information.
[00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:46.517]  We have this from NBC and the Times of London.
[00:09:46.557 --> 00:09:47.177]  Here's a headline.
[00:09:47.217 --> 00:09:48.919]  Firm was covered for CIA.
[00:09:48.939 --> 00:09:49.500]  Here's another one.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.042]  Local companies' employees die in Saudi bombing.
[00:09:52.522 --> 00:09:59.148]  Of the 70, though, the entire senior staff, in fact, most of them, 50 people were not there.
[00:09:59.208 --> 00:10:05.454]  But the maids and other people were, and well, we know what happened to them, unfortunately.
[00:10:06.858 --> 00:10:10.699]  So that is coming up as well.
[00:10:11.099 --> 00:10:19.921]  Amazing economic numbers coming out, and more prior knowledge, government involvement coming out in the mainstream news.
[00:10:20.621 --> 00:10:22.282]  And so we'll be covering that.
[00:10:22.342 --> 00:10:30.743]  But this thing where the government says, give up all your liberty for security, or you're not going to be safe, and then the border's wide open.
[00:10:31.624 --> 00:10:32.604]  I'm here in Texas.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.662]  And there are eighteen wheelers all over the place full of illegal aliens.
[00:10:40.663 --> 00:10:47.745]  And routinely, every week or two, I hear about people dead in a van, dead in a trunk, dead in an eighteen wheeler.
[00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:53.128]  You hear about it in New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California.
[00:10:53.168 --> 00:10:56.929]  You hear about a van full of fifteen people crashing and half of them die.
[00:10:56.969 --> 00:10:59.890]  It's horrible for these immigrants.
[00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:03.332]  The coyotes that feed on them are criminal.
[00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:08.028]  Obviously, but our government leaves the border completely wide open.
[00:11:08.408 --> 00:11:13.431]  It is harder to get out of the country into Mexico or to get out of the country into Canada.
[00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:20.675]  They x-ray you going into Canada, our government does, but getting in, you walk right in, it's no problem.
[00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:26.699]  The government's telling you, brace for more attacks, they're going to take all our rights away, the Pentagon's going to watch every move we make.
[00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:34.242]  And Human Events has reported record numbers of illegals from the Middle East and legals are being allowed in.
[00:11:34.362 --> 00:11:35.382]  Nothing's being done.
[00:11:35.702 --> 00:11:39.704]  In the first six months after 9-1-1, I haven't kept track since then, 125,000.
[00:11:40.364 --> 00:11:49.367]  A record of Muslims from terrorist-sponsored countries, from watch-list countries like Syria and Sudan.
[00:11:50.148 --> 00:11:54.449]  But don't worry, the Pentagon's gonna watch you and your family.
[00:11:54.689 --> 00:11:56.150]  They've said it, that that's the chill.
[00:11:57.426 --> 00:11:59.467]  That's to scare you into not speaking up.
[00:11:59.507 --> 00:12:02.148]  Believe me, they don't have the personnel or the time or the energy.
[00:12:02.508 --> 00:12:05.829]  And a lot of people in the military on our side, they know the truth.
[00:12:06.129 --> 00:12:09.110]  And the globalists are really walking a tightrope here.
[00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:10.771]  So good!
[00:12:10.851 --> 00:12:11.431]  Listen to me.
[00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:11.971]  Listen to me.
[00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:12.991]  All of you listen to me.
[00:12:13.011 --> 00:12:15.392]  Check out what I have to say and decide whose side you're on here.
[00:12:15.592 --> 00:12:18.213]  Bodies of 18 immigrants found in truck in Texas.
[00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:29.482]  Reuters, the bodies of 18 illegal Mexican immigrants who died from suffocation and heat exhaustion were discovered on Wednesday in a packed trailer, tractor trailer, abandoned at a rest stop.
[00:12:29.842 --> 00:12:39.686]  The gruesome find on the outskirts of the south central Texas town of Victoria was one of the most worst cases of immigrant smuggling deaths in recent memory.
[00:12:40.046 --> 00:12:45.548]  The trailer was equipped with a refrigeration unit but it was not on at the time.
[00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:46.628]  Now,
[00:12:47.597 --> 00:12:48.538]  They're saying 60 to 80.
[00:12:48.918 --> 00:12:50.339]  They won't tell us the exact number.
[00:12:50.439 --> 00:12:51.500]  Now they're saying as many as 100.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.742]  I have four different articles here.
[00:12:53.862 --> 00:12:55.943]  One says 100, one says 80, one says 60.
[00:12:56.323 --> 00:13:04.550]  The latest article says as many as 100 packed in there like Jews on a Nazi railway car.
[00:13:06.231 --> 00:13:07.472]  And does Mexico care?
[00:13:07.592 --> 00:13:07.732]  No.
[00:13:07.772 --> 00:13:13.116]  They're suing our government for not putting water systems out in the desert for the illegals.
[00:13:14.032 --> 00:13:19.828]  The Mexican government is giving them survival packs and these truck drivers, these Mexican truck drivers and American truck drivers...
[00:13:21.124 --> 00:13:26.045]  are packing in some cases that I've seen over a hundred into these vehicles.
[00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:32.826]  The gruesome find on the outskirts of the south central Texas town of Victoria was one of the worst cases of immigrant smuggling deaths in recent memory.
[00:13:33.186 --> 00:13:36.587]  The trailer was equipped with a refrigeration unit but it was not on at the time.
[00:13:37.047 --> 00:13:50.169]  Someone from inside the sweltering truck used his cell phone to call an emergency 911 operator around midnight frantically pleading that the immigrant was trapped and suffocating but the call was lost and the truck rode on until Victoria.
[00:13:50.749 --> 00:14:03.738]  It was two hours later when the sheriff's deputies responded to a disturbance at the truck stop, discovered the dead among a group of immigrants packed into the trailer, many of whom ran off when the doors were opened early on Wednesday morning.
[00:14:03.798 --> 00:14:07.540]  Authorities said they could account for at least 62 immigrants dead or alive.
[00:14:07.921 --> 00:14:08.901]  Michael Shelby, U.S.
[00:14:08.961 --> 00:14:14.545]  Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, said as many as 100 could have been inside the truck.
[00:14:15.045 --> 00:14:20.349]  It appeared to have been driven roughly four hours to Victoria from somewhere near the Mexican border.
[00:14:20.969 --> 00:14:26.274]  The phone call came around midnight as the truck drove through Kingsville, more than 100 miles south of Victoria.
[00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:35.321]  Kingsville Police Chief Sam Granato said, the Spanish-speaking caller told the English-speaking operator, we're asphyxiating, we're illegals.
[00:14:36.462 --> 00:14:39.605]  Granato said, but the police could not trace the phone's location.
[00:14:39.985 --> 00:14:44.329]  Oh, funny, all the new phones have got the satellite tracker chip in them, off the cell towers.
[00:14:44.649 --> 00:14:46.290]  We'll all need that now to save us.
[00:14:46.771 --> 00:14:49.573]  They won't stop the open border, but they'll do that, don't worry.
[00:14:50.817 --> 00:14:53.639]  And again, Mexicans send record amount home.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.202]  This is out of Financial Times.
[00:14:57.022 --> 00:15:01.366]  It says here that remittances of money from the U.S.
[00:15:01.386 --> 00:15:11.654]  to Mexico reached a new record, $2.74 billion in the first quarter of the year, revealing a flow of money home for Mexico migrants much higher than previously noted.
[00:15:12.475 --> 00:15:15.798]  The new data from Mexico's Central Bank also shows
[00:15:16.681 --> 00:15:19.645]  A 26% rise from the first quarter of last year.
[00:15:20.325 --> 00:15:23.109]  NAFTA is destroying Mexico.
[00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:25.832]  NAFTA is destroying America.
[00:15:27.466 --> 00:15:41.420]  I talk to immigrants from Mexico all the time and my wife speaks Spanish and we talk to them and I talk to my listeners and they tell me that, and I read the news, Mexico's factories are shutting down.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.764]  Folks, if Mexico can't compete with China, how can we compete with China?
[00:15:45.984 --> 00:15:49.708]  I mean, at least Mexico buys something from us
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.647]  China buys almost nothing but military hardware and raw materiel.
[00:15:56.007 --> 00:15:58.891]  This is very, very serious.
[00:16:00.373 --> 00:16:02.756]  But they told you, Naftingale, it would be so good for you.
[00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:04.579]  Yeah, look how good it's been for the economy.
[00:16:04.619 --> 00:16:06.842]  Wait till I get to the economic stack here.
[00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:10.690]  And finally, Joseph Farah's telling the truth.
[00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.732]  Joseph Farah's been in a love affair with Bush.
[00:16:13.052 --> 00:16:15.174]  They did a good job of exposing Clinton as a globalist.
[00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:19.018]  They've gone neo-con on us the last year or two.
[00:16:19.598 --> 00:16:29.487]  Well, now Farah's written a lengthy four-page analysis of the growing threat of fascism, saying America is descending into a nightmare police state.
[00:16:30.023 --> 00:16:35.166]  Hey, I'm glad you woke up, Farah, or is it that your readers demanded it?
[00:16:35.747 --> 00:16:45.533]  I believe for some time now, he says, that the greatest threat to American freedoms is not from socialism or communism, but rather an ism you seldom hear much about these days, fascism!
[00:16:46.754 --> 00:16:47.595]  Understand what I mean?
[00:16:47.655 --> 00:16:51.037]  Most people need to rethink their notions about the political spectrum and the left
[00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:57.543]  And most people agree you have communism, total government control over the means of production and property.
[00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:00.324]  It's the other end of the spectrum that many get confused.
[00:17:00.804 --> 00:17:05.745]  Ask most left-wingers and they'll suggest that fascism is on the extreme right, 180 degrees from communism.
[00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:06.585]  Uh-uh!
[00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:08.225]  Wow, Ferry, you've been listening to the show?
[00:17:08.265 --> 00:17:10.946]  We know a lot of Roman Daily writers listen when you've admitted that.
[00:17:11.446 --> 00:17:13.126]  I've got news for you, friends!
[00:17:13.226 --> 00:17:16.067]  Fascism and communism are ideological kissin' cousins.
[00:17:16.407 --> 00:17:17.087]  Boy, you said it.
[00:17:17.487 --> 00:17:21.048]  I would place fascism and socialism just a few degrees to the right of communism.
[00:17:21.688 --> 00:17:23.390]  No, Farrah, it's not left-right.
[00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:30.095]  Fascism, communism, socialism, all on the command-and-control, tyranny, serfdom, feudalism end.
[00:17:30.576 --> 00:17:34.799]  Republics, constitutional republics, are on the other end of that spectrum.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.861]  Get a little more sophisticated.
[00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:37.501]  I think you are.
[00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:38.042]  I think you know.
[00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:43.113]  They gotta keep you in that left-right, you think you get a choice when really you're on the big government side.
[00:17:43.153 --> 00:17:48.277]  Remember, both fascism and socialism favor, to one degree or another, government control of production and distribution.
[00:17:48.577 --> 00:17:49.358]  Thank you, Farah.
[00:17:49.838 --> 00:17:55.703]  The only thing that distinguishes fascism from socialism is economic theory is how they get that control.
[00:17:56.123 --> 00:17:59.026]  Fascists realize the government doesn't need to own industry to control it.
[00:17:59.486 --> 00:18:04.590]  Through regulation and taxation, fascists know they can achieve the same results without nearly as much
[00:18:05.248 --> 00:18:06.650]  Work and responsibility.
[00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:10.375]  Well, yeah, the globalists are the... Folks, the capitalists are not free market.
[00:18:10.916 --> 00:18:19.887]  Last year, Jiang Zemin, before he left, said on the BBC, on TV, Capitalism is the ultimate form of communism.
[00:18:20.368 --> 00:18:22.831]  Now this is the leader of the most populous country.
[00:18:22.851 --> 00:18:23.512]  He's not stupid.
[00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:33.865]  He finally broke the mold, and then Kim Jong-il said it, some leaders of Europe said it, because they were in Tiananmen Square with the Fortune 500 with tanks parading.
[00:18:34.505 --> 00:18:35.425]  This is slavery.
[00:18:35.485 --> 00:18:36.325]  It's feudalism.
[00:18:37.706 --> 00:18:39.506]  So now they're really scrambling our brains.
[00:18:41.006 --> 00:18:42.207]  And it goes on and on.
[00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:45.147]  Communism, fascism, it means nothing.
[00:18:45.488 --> 00:18:46.008]  Nothing.
[00:18:46.888 --> 00:18:50.189]  It's all strongman, thug, empire.
[00:18:50.249 --> 00:18:50.889]  Get it straight.
[00:18:52.828 --> 00:18:54.671]  And now we get into the economic news.
[00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:59.660]  California governor proposes tax hikes, bond issues, the state implodes, though they really do have large surpluses.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.341]  It's a scam.
[00:19:00.922 --> 00:19:02.004]  They have two sets of books.
[00:19:03.358 --> 00:19:08.240]  Also, the government says organized attacks are imminent here and in the UK.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.441]  Terror crackdown has not reduced al-Qaeda threat warrants.
[00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:13.662]  The CIA front group is getting us ready for more terror.
[00:19:13.762 --> 00:19:15.262]  Brace yourselves for more slavery.
[00:19:15.702 --> 00:19:18.243]  China may execute SARS quarantine violators.
[00:19:18.503 --> 00:19:22.165]  Well, our government said they'll execute quarantine violators in the Detroit Free Press.
[00:19:23.165 --> 00:19:24.466]  They've said it in the Rocky Mountain News.
[00:19:24.486 --> 00:19:25.686]  They've said it in hundreds of papers.
[00:19:25.726 --> 00:19:31.268]  And in the Scotsman yesterday, they said that they'll kill anybody that tries to run quarantine, even from a dirty bomb.
[00:19:32.236 --> 00:19:38.020]  But the big news when we get back, dead man left on gym floor while others exercise, just how people don't care anymore.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.141]  War crimes lawsuit filed against Franks in Belgium.
[00:19:42.062 --> 00:19:43.923]  How high can the Euro go?
[00:19:44.043 --> 00:19:45.324]  Analysts raise targets.
[00:19:45.764 --> 00:19:48.486]  Update, gold hits 10-week high, BRICS currency link.
[00:19:49.984 --> 00:19:50.124]  U.S.
[00:19:50.164 --> 00:19:53.167]  retail sales and import prices fall sharply.
[00:19:53.307 --> 00:19:54.368]  Bad news for the economy.
[00:19:54.688 --> 00:19:55.469]  Retail plunge.
[00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:57.050]  Economic worry is up.
[00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.452]  Jaw-boning reality for Treasury.
[00:19:59.552 --> 00:20:02.755]  Snow couldn't fight the dollar if he wanted to, and he doesn't.
[00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:05.937]  Ten-year Treasury note yield falls a 45-year low.
[00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:08.099]  You don't want to miss this vital info.
[00:20:08.139 --> 00:20:09.120]  Believe me, we'll be right back.
[00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:15.216]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[00:20:15.496 --> 00:20:17.618]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[00:20:18.078 --> 00:20:22.643]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[00:20:22.983 --> 00:20:24.344]  It actually works.
[00:20:24.745 --> 00:20:27.487]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things.
[00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:29.729]  Over the years I've tried many, many products.
[00:20:29.889 --> 00:20:32.111]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenate.
[00:20:32.492 --> 00:20:35.835]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[00:20:36.511 --> 00:20:37.152]  It truly works.
[00:20:37.492 --> 00:20:38.673]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:20:39.094 --> 00:20:44.819]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.

[00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:12.760]  It's here.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.760]  It's powerful.

[00:22:09.005 --> 00:22:15.211]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:23.458]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:23.799 --> 00:22:31.646]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:31.966 --> 00:22:36.708]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:37.048 --> 00:22:41.749]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:46.111]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:47.631]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:51.792]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:52.213 --> 00:22:56.594]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:57.114 --> 00:22:59.635]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:16.936]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:23:17.176 --> 00:23:28.441]  The Burkulite's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:23:28.661 --> 00:23:31.302]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:23:31.662 --> 00:23:35.744]  The Burkulite has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[00:23:35.964 --> 00:23:38.105]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:23:38.265 --> 00:23:40.126]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:23:40.346 --> 00:23:46.369]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:23:46.609 --> 00:23:52.272]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:24:24.884 --> 00:24:25.825]  Alex Jones here.
[00:24:25.885 --> 00:24:32.210]  I've got a bunch of economic news, huge amounts of Second Amendment news, government-sponsored terrorism information.
[00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.053]  We can't back down if we love our families.
[00:24:35.133 --> 00:24:45.942]  Colonel Craig Roberts is on the road going to Kansas City, and we're going to be there Saturday speaking at the Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center, and I called Craig.
[00:24:45.962 --> 00:24:47.123]  I was talking to him.
[00:24:47.143 --> 00:24:49.806]  I wanted to get him up for like 10-15 minutes just to get his
[00:24:50.859 --> 00:24:51.419]  We're good to go.
[00:25:05.698 --> 00:25:08.700]  And the Times of London firm was cover for CIA.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.382]  Here's the NBC headline, local companies' employees died in Saudi bombing.
[00:25:12.842 --> 00:25:15.544]  But over 50 of the 70 were gone, all the senior people.
[00:25:16.084 --> 00:25:19.086]  And it turns out it's a Carlisle-slash-CIA front group.
[00:25:19.686 --> 00:25:22.428]  And that's from the mainstream media, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:31.833]  Colonel Roberts, we talked a couple days ago on the phone about this, and we have the same understanding, and as investigators, you're of course a former
[00:25:32.481 --> 00:25:39.203]  Police Officer, Investigator, SWAT Team, Helicopter Pilot, Marine Corps Sniper, Vietnam, Best-Selling Author, Colonel in Army Intelligence.
[00:25:39.623 --> 00:25:42.044]  Your take on the bombings for the listeners.
[00:25:44.665 --> 00:25:50.127]  What stood out to me, Alex, was that the damage that was done
[00:25:50.985 --> 00:25:59.509]  With the amount of explosives that it took, it wasn't anywhere near what happened at the Murrah Building with the Ryder truck.
[00:25:59.789 --> 00:26:10.975]  We got the Kovar Towers where they drove in there with a tanker truck loaded up with Semtex plastic explosives, which is a whole lot more powerful, ten times more powerful than ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel.
[00:26:12.217 --> 00:26:23.626]  And all it did in the Kovar Towers was knock off the facade of the front of the building, blow out the windows, rearrange the furniture, and make a huge crater 80 feet long in the street.
[00:26:23.746 --> 00:26:28.330]  In the Murr Building they had like a 20 foot crater which was 8 feet deep that wasn't anything.
[00:26:29.131 --> 00:26:35.996]  And it took out a huge chunk of the building and busted reinforced concrete that was a lot stronger than what was at the Kovar Towers.
[00:26:36.016 --> 00:26:37.698]  So yesterday we saw a repeat.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:48.868]  I mean, a few days ago we saw a repeat of the Kovar Towers incident where they had a, you know, these two teams went in, the first one with guns and shot the area up, killed the guards, and then the bomb went in, or the truck bomb went in and went off.
[00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:58.116]  And you could see that with the amount of explosives they had, they said it was somewhere between five and eight hundred pounds of plastic explosives, which is almost like a mini-nuke.
[00:26:58.593 --> 00:27:01.334]  And all it did was knock the front facade of the building off again.
[00:27:01.774 --> 00:27:07.376]  And yeah, there were some other weakened concrete buildings that were rubbled and the cars were, you know, burned up and stuff like that.
[00:27:07.796 --> 00:27:11.398]  Which is typical because of the heat of the blast, the concussion, the presence effect.
[00:27:11.898 --> 00:27:17.360]  But the damage wasn't there because there was no charges inside the building.
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.501]  The truck went off outside the building.
[00:27:19.541 --> 00:27:27.784]  And if those two incidents don't point at Oklahoma City as having explosives inside the building, to one and all, I don't know what will.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:42.914]  Then, switching tracks real quick, because I know we're both limited on time here, I predicted on your show here a few weeks ago, that after Iraq, that there would be attacks in Saudi Arabia like Khobar Towers.
[00:27:42.954 --> 00:27:49.040]  There would be attacks in Saudi Arabia, there would also be an opening, they would start generating
[00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:51.203]  Discontent with Iran.
[00:27:51.343 --> 00:27:55.305]  They'll be bringing up terrorist groups and terrorist factions and the people in Iran want it.
[00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:55.945]  Let me stop you.
[00:27:56.005 --> 00:27:57.125]  Explain how that works.
[00:27:57.185 --> 00:28:02.488]  The CIA goes in, hires some Muslim leaders, pays them, they go out and find the useful idiots to carry it out.
[00:28:02.728 --> 00:28:04.209]  This has been done over and over again.
[00:28:04.469 --> 00:28:18.495]  Well, if you get in the Medusa file, my book, the Medusa file, and go back and look at how we overthrew, most of the day, in Iran to begin with, with CIA assets, went in, generated, you know, paid for our own little army,
[00:28:18.954 --> 00:28:26.598]  And generated a small coup d'etat revolution and got rid of Mosaddegh and installed the Shah.
[00:28:26.778 --> 00:28:27.478]  That was typical.
[00:28:27.558 --> 00:28:29.219]  Of course, the CIA has done that all over the world.
[00:28:29.239 --> 00:28:39.524]  They've done it in South America, Central America, the old banana wars, all the rest of it, where you get the local people to overthrow the government, but you have to provide their arms and equipment.
[00:28:39.544 --> 00:28:42.926]  Your special forces, that's what special forces does.
[00:28:43.286 --> 00:28:43.887]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:28:43.927 --> 00:28:44.627]  That's their job.
[00:28:45.382 --> 00:28:52.414]  And it's to train and equip and lead a local army.
[00:28:52.992 --> 00:28:56.314]  Indigenous forces in the overthrow of the local government.
[00:28:56.334 --> 00:29:03.779]  Can you believe the CIA front story in the Times of London and the NBC, with most of them out of the building and it being a CIA op?
[00:29:03.819 --> 00:29:05.019]  I mean, this is getting ridiculous.
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:17.587]  Well, you know, right now it's too early to really start pointing fingers, but here you've got a group who I know has got to be attached to, or part of... Colonel, what did you say to me on the cell phone as we were both driving along the other day?
[00:29:17.987 --> 00:29:19.708]  Well, basically I think that it's going to be a...
[00:29:21.812 --> 00:29:28.339]  Preparation for us to start putting forces into Saudi Arabia, because the government isn't going along with what we want to do.
[00:29:28.359 --> 00:29:33.144]  So they destabilize it, just like they used Bin Laden to attack Serbia in 1998.
[00:29:33.184 --> 00:29:34.365]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:34.986 --> 00:29:39.830]  And you have to create discontent with the situation.
[00:29:39.871 --> 00:29:44.275]  And we've got all of this stuff over there right now, so it's real easy to turn the tanks around and go the other way.
[00:29:44.375 --> 00:29:45.796]  We'll do about eight more minutes with us.
[00:29:45.816 --> 00:29:47.557]  We'll come back in about five minutes on the other side.
[00:29:47.597 --> 00:29:48.697]  Colonel Roberts, stay right there.
[00:29:48.717 --> 00:29:49.638]  We've got a break.
[00:29:49.698 --> 00:29:50.618]  Talk more about this.
[00:29:50.678 --> 00:29:52.539]  I'll hit on these news articles in a little more detail.
[00:29:52.779 --> 00:29:56.881]  Then I'll get into the economy, which is folks, I'm concerned.
[00:29:56.901 --> 00:29:57.581]  This is scary.
[00:30:00.363 --> 00:30:01.263]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.763 --> 00:30:03.364]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.285 --> 00:30:06.966]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.952]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:30:13.212 --> 00:30:18.937]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:30:19.197 --> 00:30:21.299]  You haven't alkalized your body and fat body.

[00:30:36.292 --> 00:30:38.194]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:30:38.694 --> 00:30:41.576]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:42.797 --> 00:30:44.579]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:30:44.699 --> 00:30:46.921]  Crashing with the lies and disinformation.
[00:30:47.831 --> 00:30:52.995]  Again, the economic news coming up, 2nd Amendment news, police state news, government-sponsored terror news.
[00:30:53.015 --> 00:30:59.579]  We've got Colonel Roberts on with us on this Thursday, live edition, for an update on his take on the bombings.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.103]  He predicted them on the show, that they would take place in Saudi Arabia, but he stabilized.
[00:31:04.123 --> 00:31:08.566]  The globalists knew this, they created Fidel, they brought down the Shah, then they act like
[00:31:09.504 --> 00:31:10.785]  That they're trying to stop it.
[00:31:10.805 --> 00:31:14.206]  This is how they destabilize, because the Saudis aren't following all the orders correctly.
[00:31:14.686 --> 00:31:18.128]  Colonel Roberts, what do you see now happening in your crystal ball?
[00:31:18.688 --> 00:31:29.052]  Well, you know, what the people of Kansas City are going to get is a lot more detailed description of this, because I'm going to go into what the globalist intelligent community consists of, and who they really work for, and what their agenda is.
[00:31:29.612 --> 00:31:34.174]  And in the Middle East right now, what we're looking at is three possible targets.
[00:31:34.254 --> 00:31:37.135]  Originally, it was going to be Iran, with the possibility of Syria.
[00:31:37.882 --> 00:31:49.430]  Uh, as places that we were going to move into one way or another, whether it was with military force or with COVID action or with, uh... But they're neocon talking heads like Limbaugh have said they're going to go into Saudi Arabia and you might be surprised, they say.
[00:31:49.831 --> 00:32:01.719]  Well, it's no surprise because Saudi Arabia is right next door and, you know, when you're talking about the three countries that border Iraq to the west, to the east, and to the south, because they're not going to go into Turkey.
[00:32:01.759 --> 00:32:03.080]  Turkey's one of our buddies already.
[00:32:03.593 --> 00:32:14.224]  So, you know, you look at Saudi Arabia, you've got the Saudi Arabian oil fields, but another thing you've got is the hometown of a whole lot of Islamic terrorist groups who are financed by the Saudi government.
[00:32:14.464 --> 00:32:16.306]  And who's the Saudi government financed by?
[00:32:16.346 --> 00:32:22.632]  Well, they're financed by their own oil money, they're financed by international oil companies with a lot of money paid.
[00:32:23.038 --> 00:32:25.599]  To the privilege of operating oil fields.
[00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:33.862]  Well, Colonel, this is all really a global destabilization while they bring down our economy, get the Euro online, bring in the cashless society control grid.
[00:32:34.102 --> 00:32:39.744]  If they can keep us in a war, that'll divert us off the plunging economy and the shopping malls being empty.
[00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:44.006]  Because this, it's not just oil or weapon sales, it's about a global police state.
[00:32:44.206 --> 00:32:48.688]  From Russia to the US, governments are using the terror as a massive crackdown mechanism.
[00:32:48.888 --> 00:32:51.569]  We know Putin got caught blowing up buildings in Russia.
[00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:54.130]  Well, it's order out of chaos, ob-de-cao.
[00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:54.950]  That's their motto.
[00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.911]  And it's tear it down and rebuild it the way they want.
[00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:01.191]  And they do that on several fronts at the same time.
[00:33:01.231 --> 00:33:02.392]  And one of them is economic.
[00:33:02.712 --> 00:33:05.533]  And there's two types of economies.
[00:33:05.573 --> 00:33:07.873]  That's the war economy and the peace economy.
[00:33:07.913 --> 00:33:11.074]  Well, the peace economy only works so long before it becomes overinflated.
[00:33:11.134 --> 00:33:15.015]  And we have what happened when the Clintons left office and all the lies surfaced.
[00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:18.736]  9-11 happened and all of a sudden the stock market cut itself almost in half.
[00:33:19.526 --> 00:33:22.008]  Scott Martin was already plunging the week before 9-11.
[00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:23.850]  Well, sure, but it's a cycle.
[00:33:24.411 --> 00:33:34.620]  And the war cycle is, okay, we've got to rebuild the economy and we're going to do that because we're going to be able to buy more guns, beans, bullets and bandages and support the boys in Oceania.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:42.787]  And for those that don't know in the floating fortresses, for those that don't know, the Global has even put out a lot of white papers that are public admitting this war economy.
[00:33:43.522 --> 00:33:49.184]  Well, there are several books that have been written through the years going back into the 1800s that talk about this.
[00:33:49.204 --> 00:34:03.608]  When you have to stabilize a government or accomplish an objective along this way, you can make the people happy by having profits generated from the sales of arms and equipment and so on.
[00:34:03.688 --> 00:34:09.070]  Plus, a nation at war is one that has to cast its hat in the ring of the population getting behind the government.
[00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.871]  Because if you don't get behind the government, then you're not a patriot.
[00:34:12.131 --> 00:34:17.234]  And then meanwhile, they can move in with Patriot Act 1 and 2, homeland security, and total slavery.
[00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:28.962]  Well, you go back to World War II, you know, loose lips, sink ships, the whole propaganda deal, you know, there's a spy on every corner, the Germans are everywhere, the Japanese are all over California, you know, inform on your neighbor and the whole bit.
[00:34:29.002 --> 00:34:30.303]  That was, you know, that was
[00:34:30.885 --> 00:34:34.948]  Overreaction to the nth degree that came out of Hoover and FDR's offices.
[00:34:35.028 --> 00:34:37.850]  And over and over again we track back where the terrorism comes from.
[00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.531]  It comes from that shadow government.
[00:34:39.832 --> 00:34:42.754]  Colonel Roberts, we're going to be in Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:34:43.474 --> 00:34:50.880]  And it's going to be this Saturday at the Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center on I-70 between Kansas City and Independence, Missouri.
[00:34:51.856 --> 00:34:53.156]  And I'm going to be speaking.
[00:34:53.176 --> 00:34:55.457]  You're going to be there with a two-plus hour presentation.
[00:34:55.477 --> 00:34:56.757]  We'll both be taking questions.
[00:34:56.777 --> 00:35:01.718]  We're going to have a little roundtable discussion, and it's going to be a great deal, and I hope to see folks out there.
[00:35:01.738 --> 00:35:04.879]  It's a benefit for KCXL 1140 AM.
[00:35:05.379 --> 00:35:11.800]  We've got links to that on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for folks who want to find out more details.
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.221]  You've got about a minute and a half left.
[00:35:13.261 --> 00:35:13.881]  I know you're busy.
[00:35:13.961 --> 00:35:15.181]  Any other key points you want to hit on?
[00:35:15.862 --> 00:35:24.407]  Well, I think right now we ought to keep our eyes focused, not only on the Middle East, but on Korea, because I've got a really bad feeling that Korea is going to be flexing its muscles on China.
[00:35:24.427 --> 00:35:26.588]  Well, we just saw them shoot lasers at these helicopters.
[00:35:26.648 --> 00:35:33.752]  Well, and look at China, it's got all of its troops on the beach, just eyeing Taiwan every single day.
[00:35:33.772 --> 00:35:37.714]  They've been massing for three years for a D-Day invasion and saying they're going to do it.
[00:35:37.934 --> 00:35:41.476]  Yeah, all these guys are waiting for is the right time and a green light from the globalists.
[00:35:43.906 --> 00:35:44.727]  Well, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:44.787 --> 00:35:50.352]  And control World War III, and I guess then we won't argue with being in a police state because it's for Oceania.
[00:35:50.833 --> 00:35:51.293]  There it is.
[00:35:51.854 --> 00:35:54.917]  And anybody that doesn't know what that is, they need to go back to the Orwell book and
[00:35:56.443 --> 00:35:58.384]  1984, I think it was, or whichever one it was.
[00:35:58.424 --> 00:36:05.848]  Anyway, they need to look at... Everybody at home has to support the war effort in Oceania, even though they don't know much about it.
[00:36:05.908 --> 00:36:09.330]  It's on the other side of the world, so you've got to support the troops at the front and all of that.
[00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:10.171]  All right.
[00:36:10.211 --> 00:36:14.113]  Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Colonel Roberts, in Kansas City.
[00:36:14.133 --> 00:36:14.693]  God bless you.
[00:36:14.933 --> 00:36:15.453]  We'll see you there.
[00:36:15.774 --> 00:36:16.294]  Take care.
[00:36:17.254 --> 00:36:19.255]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:21.306 --> 00:36:21.606]  All right.
[00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:22.807]  Now, I haven't gone to any calls yet.
[00:36:22.827 --> 00:36:24.008]  I haven't given the number out yet.
[00:36:24.028 --> 00:36:25.730]  It's always a good idea to do that, I guess.
[00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:26.190]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.511]  800-259-9231.
[00:36:26.671 --> 00:36:30.154]  And we'll go to some of your calls.
[00:36:30.374 --> 00:36:38.441]  And then, of course, I'm going to cover this economic news.
[00:36:38.521 --> 00:36:46.748]  And we've got a guest coming on from Canada, TV host and writer in the newspapers, one of the most highly acclaimed
[00:36:47.645 --> 00:36:48.265]  We're good to go.
[00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:06.810]  Folks, if you haven't gotten water filters, and these are the best out there.
[00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.351]  It's what I bought before he was a sponsor.
[00:37:08.951 --> 00:37:09.612]  And I paid mortgage.
[00:37:09.672 --> 00:37:10.573]  It came from somebody else.
[00:37:10.613 --> 00:37:11.373]  I bought it from Jim.
[00:37:11.854 --> 00:37:12.654]  It's Jim Shepard.
[00:37:12.774 --> 00:37:16.637]  And you're nuts if you don't buy potassium iodate in case there's a radiological event.
[00:37:16.917 --> 00:37:17.878]  It'll protect your thyroid.
[00:37:17.898 --> 00:37:18.759]  Number one cause of death.
[00:37:19.694 --> 00:37:22.575]  They've got the shower filters where your body really absorbs the poison.
[00:37:22.595 --> 00:37:24.915]  Why are you giving your kids all the poison that's in the water?
[00:37:25.256 --> 00:37:29.477]  They've got the new black Berkey elements in the Berkey light system.
[00:37:29.897 --> 00:37:32.757]  It's an incredible system and you need to get it.
[00:37:33.318 --> 00:37:34.998]  Jim, thanks for coming on with us, my friend.
[00:37:35.258 --> 00:37:35.958]  Always a pleasure.
[00:37:35.978 --> 00:37:37.639]  How are you today, Alex?
[00:37:38.139 --> 00:37:43.900]  Jim, I'm watching the economy implode and people had better get prepared.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:44.881]  They had better
[00:37:47.717 --> 00:37:49.679]  Wake people up and point out what's happening.
[00:37:49.739 --> 00:37:50.399]  It is scary.
[00:37:51.801 --> 00:37:53.982]  You know, I've been watching this stock market.
[00:37:54.002 --> 00:37:56.445]  Of course, I used to be intimately involved with the stock market.
[00:37:57.265 --> 00:38:06.933]  And I look at, you know, the market race stuff right now, and it's just doing the... It's raced up really since we kind of went in there and kicked tail in Baghdad.
[00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:09.240]  But it's all in hopes and dreams.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:14.307]  There's bad news coming out, bad economy, and people putting their money back in.
[00:38:14.628 --> 00:38:15.689]  There's no one at the stores.
[00:38:15.729 --> 00:38:17.812]  I go to CompUSA to buy something computer-wise.
[00:38:18.153 --> 00:38:18.854]  I go to the mall.
[00:38:18.874 --> 00:38:19.935]  There's no one there, Jim.
[00:38:23.584 --> 00:38:27.866]  That's basically the story all the way through the economy.
[00:38:27.886 --> 00:38:30.428]  And they're saying it's brace for massive terror attacks.
[00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:31.708]  We're gonna get hit.
[00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:32.729]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:38:33.089 --> 00:38:34.710]  People, you better get essentials.
[00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:37.631]  You better pick up the phone and get these water filters.
[00:38:37.651 --> 00:38:39.012]  You are nuts if you don't.
[00:38:39.292 --> 00:38:41.914]  Jim, tell them about the new items, what they do.
[00:38:41.934 --> 00:38:43.694]  It really is an incredible new product.
[00:38:44.275 --> 00:38:49.337]  Well, briefly, we came out with a new filter element that is actually a purifier.
[00:38:50.959 --> 00:38:58.021]  When we tested it with pathogenic bacteria, we tested it with 10,000 times more contamination than you'd normally test a filter.
[00:38:58.661 --> 00:39:01.902]  With most filters, it would totally overwhelm and just ruin the filters.
[00:39:02.602 --> 00:39:04.562]  No pathogenic bacteria got through.
[00:39:05.503 --> 00:39:07.803]  And we did the same thing with chemicals.
[00:39:07.883 --> 00:39:14.385]  We tested it with the various chemicals and non-detect, nothing came through.
[00:39:15.428 --> 00:39:23.152]  And in minerals, we reduce the heavy metals like mercury and lead.
[00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:25.413]  So it's a real powerful filter element.
[00:39:25.433 --> 00:39:27.654]  And we've combined that with a new filter system.
[00:39:29.055 --> 00:39:31.976]  And the new filter system is gravity fed.
[00:39:32.037 --> 00:39:34.258]  So if the power goes out, you can still use it.
[00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:43.742]  It's powerful enough to filter pond, lake, or river water, or whatever raw, untreated water that's available.
[00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.351]  So it's basically an all-around filter.
[00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:48.711]  And Jim, this is not hype.
[00:39:48.751 --> 00:39:51.572]  People know I'm not engaged in that, and I talk about real stuff.
[00:39:51.972 --> 00:39:54.012]  You had a major university study the filters.
[00:39:54.052 --> 00:39:56.453]  They'd never seen anything like it.
[00:39:56.733 --> 00:40:00.294]  You took the existing technology and jumped light years ahead.
[00:40:00.314 --> 00:40:01.954]  Tell them about that development.
[00:40:02.534 --> 00:40:12.477]  Well, we tested it with lawn growth, which is too many pathogenic bacteria in the water to count them, but they know there's over a billion.
[00:40:13.499 --> 00:40:20.685]  And based on that, a standard filter that can remove pathogenic bacteria, you'd expect to see 100,000 microbes left in the water.
[00:40:21.606 --> 00:40:25.569]  And when they got through testing ours, nothing got through.
[00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:29.272]  Then they incubated the water to see if anything would grow in it.
[00:40:29.312 --> 00:40:32.435]  And their conclusion was that there's nothing in there but pure H2O.
[00:40:34.356 --> 00:40:37.839]  So it's really... And tell them that you had a famous scientist do the test.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:39.721]  That's correct.
[00:40:40.161 --> 00:40:42.343]  And... Tell them about that.
[00:40:43.044 --> 00:40:52.351]  Well, Alex, I tell you what, I'm on a business trip and I've got to be somewhere in about 15 minutes, but if I can... I'd like to give a little special out here.
[00:40:52.531 --> 00:40:53.412]  Sure, go ahead, Jim.
[00:40:53.612 --> 00:40:53.972]  Okay.
[00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:57.635]  And what we're going to do is we have the Berkey Light.
[00:40:57.675 --> 00:40:58.555]  That's the new system.
[00:40:58.595 --> 00:40:59.336]  It's transparent.
[00:40:59.376 --> 00:41:02.358]  You can see through it, so you can see how full the chambers are at all times.
[00:41:02.438 --> 00:41:03.779]  Makes it real easy to refill it.
[00:41:04.279 --> 00:41:08.422]  Made out of Lexan, which is the same material that they use for bulletproof glass.
[00:41:08.883 --> 00:41:11.965]  It's got the new Black Berkey purification elements in it.
[00:41:12.842 --> 00:41:15.905]  And we have two models, and so we'll have two specials.
[00:41:16.365 --> 00:41:19.288]  The one model has an emergency light in case the power goes out.
[00:41:19.348 --> 00:41:20.489]  It'll burn all night long.
[00:41:20.549 --> 00:41:21.830]  It's bright enough to read by.
[00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:24.532]  It'll put a glow on everything in the room.
[00:41:24.592 --> 00:41:27.514]  So it's just great for emergencies or camping.
[00:41:28.315 --> 00:41:29.336]  That system sells for $259.
[00:41:29.376 --> 00:41:31.438]  And for $299, we're going to add four sport bottles.
[00:41:31.458 --> 00:41:33.499]  The retail price on the sport bottles is $39.
[00:41:40.729 --> 00:41:46.314]  So, uh, that is a hundred and, um, ah, jeez, what is it?
[00:41:46.474 --> 00:41:47.735]  Uh, $120, uh, savings.
[00:41:47.775 --> 00:41:53.020]  For those who don't know, sports bottles are portable water filters.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:53.860]  That's correct.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.143]  You can put one in the car, you can give one to the kids, you can take one to work.
[00:41:57.303 --> 00:42:00.846]  They're just nice to have around, and they remove pathogenic bacteria.
[00:42:00.866 --> 00:42:04.249]  Folks, once you've drunk out of a real filter, you'll never drink tap again.
[00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:05.050]  That's right.
[00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:07.312]  It just makes the water real sweet.
[00:42:07.927 --> 00:42:12.828]  So, and then for those who have not gotten a potassium iodate, you can mix and match.
[00:42:12.868 --> 00:42:16.509]  If you want to get two potassium iodate, two sport bottles, that's great.
[00:42:16.969 --> 00:42:18.729]  That's the $2.99 special.
[00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:26.770]  And then we have a $120, excuse me, a $220 special.
[00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.531]  And that's going to be the Berkey Light without the lights.
[00:42:30.611 --> 00:42:32.971]  If you don't want the lights, this is a special for you.
[00:42:33.431 --> 00:42:35.052]  We're going to, that's normally $199.
[00:42:37.262 --> 00:42:40.047]  And we're going to add two sport bottles to that for $220.
[00:42:40.689 --> 00:42:44.836]  And again, you can mix and match.
[00:42:44.856 --> 00:42:49.826]  If you want to get one sport bottle and you want to get one bottle of potassium iodate, you can do that.
[00:42:51.116 --> 00:42:54.917]  And, uh, that's, uh, that's about a $60, uh, savings.
[00:42:55.278 --> 00:43:01.740]  And if folks want to buy just the replacement filters for their stainless steel Berkeys that they got from you, they can do that as well?
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.520]  Uh, they sure can.
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:09.122]  Uh, that's a $196 retail value, and for $173, that's the special.
[00:43:09.582 --> 00:43:12.043]  We'll also include a Lexan base.
[00:43:12.123 --> 00:43:16.805]  That's the same bulletproof glass, uh, material that, uh, we use on the Berkey Lite.
[00:43:17.285 --> 00:43:20.406]  But, uh, we'll include the base absolutely free.
[00:43:21.449 --> 00:43:28.253]  And that'll lift that Berkey up so you can use it in the middle of a table or in the middle of a counter so you don't have to keep it on the edge there.
[00:43:28.293 --> 00:43:29.473]  So it's a real nice stamp.
[00:43:30.654 --> 00:43:34.736]  Alright, so all the requests you had over the years, you took them, you developed this, took years to do it.
[00:43:34.856 --> 00:43:37.878]  Jim, the toll-free number for folks to call and protect themselves.
[00:43:37.898 --> 00:43:39.599]  You're nuts if you don't.
[00:43:39.619 --> 00:43:39.959]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:43:40.119 --> 00:43:47.143]  And if the operators are busy, leave your name and number and they'll call you right back or call right back.
[00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:48.250]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:43:50.272 --> 00:43:55.535]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:43:56.476 --> 00:44:01.659]  And Jim, I know you're on the road, and I appreciate you letting me drag you to the phone, you know, there in transit.
[00:44:01.999 --> 00:44:04.401]  And I appreciate the fine products and the sponsorship.
[00:44:04.421 --> 00:44:04.461]  888-803-4438.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:16.468]  And for those who want to take a look and see what the unit looks like and see what it looks like when it's lit up, you can go to Berkeylight.com.
[00:44:16.488 --> 00:44:21.633]  That's B-E-R-K-E-Y-L-I-G-H-T dot com.
[00:44:22.294 --> 00:44:25.157]  And the sport bottles are up there, and the Berkey light's up there.
[00:44:25.337 --> 00:44:29.101]  And for those that are listening, you need to tell them Alex Jones sent you to get those specials.
[00:44:29.441 --> 00:44:29.881]  That's right.
[00:44:29.921 --> 00:44:32.263]  Be sure and mention that it's the Alex Jones Special.
[00:44:32.283 --> 00:44:33.984]  You'll hear the ads running and it's a lot more.
[00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:34.724]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:44:34.964 --> 00:44:38.646]  Thanks for coming on, Jim.
[00:44:38.826 --> 00:44:39.387]  Thank you, sir.
[00:44:39.587 --> 00:44:40.087]  God bless you.
[00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:43.651]  I drugged Jim on here because I appreciate his support.
[00:44:43.691 --> 00:44:44.691]  I appreciate the products.
[00:44:44.871 --> 00:44:47.313]  And folks, you need to get this.
[00:44:47.413 --> 00:44:49.534]  You need to protect yourself and your family.
[00:44:49.554 --> 00:44:50.234]  I mean, I've done it.
[00:44:50.275 --> 00:44:51.455]  I bought from Jim Shepard.
[00:44:51.475 --> 00:44:54.837]  I bought the products he sells before I even had him as a sponsor a couple years ago.
[00:44:55.358 --> 00:44:58.279]  Okay, getting back into the news, and there's so much more.
[00:44:58.299 --> 00:44:59.200]  We've got a guest coming up.
[00:45:00.396 --> 00:45:04.999]  This is the news on the economy, and it is very, very serious.
[00:45:05.019 --> 00:45:06.539]  This is the New York Times.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.240]  How high can the euro go?
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.881]  Analysts raise targets.
[00:45:10.321 --> 00:45:12.503]  How far will the dollar fall and the euro rise?
[00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:14.604]  A lot further than many forecasters thought.
[00:45:14.724 --> 00:45:15.104]  Oh, really?
[00:45:15.444 --> 00:45:17.525]  Just a few months ago, or even a few weeks ago.
[00:45:17.985 --> 00:45:18.686]  Well, funny!
[00:45:19.026 --> 00:45:26.150]  I read what the Davos Switzerland people said, the Economic Forum, three and a half, almost four years ago, and I told you over and over again every week on the air.
[00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:34.072]  I follow what the globalists say, because I know when they say they're going to get us and enslave us, they laugh about it and then know that you don't read their policy reports.
[00:45:34.092 --> 00:45:35.072]  It's pretty scary, folks.
[00:45:35.532 --> 00:45:38.773]  The dollar's 8.7 percentage plunge against the euro since March 21st.
[00:45:38.873 --> 00:45:43.595]  It's already made exhausting existing predictions of 12 months ago, now obsolete.
[00:45:44.295 --> 00:45:55.258]  Some forecasters see the possibility the dollar's falling close to levels not seen since the mid-1990s, when the American currency dropped a record low against the European currencies, like the German mark at that time, or strong.
[00:45:56.181 --> 00:45:58.562]  Folks, it's a lot worse than what the New York Times says at 8.7%.
[00:46:01.222 --> 00:46:01.942]  Do the math.
[00:46:02.002 --> 00:46:15.345]  If the Euro's trading above 117, and they could say it hit 130, and it was 90 cents to the dollar just a few weeks ago, what does that mean?
[00:46:15.425 --> 00:46:16.845]  What's the mathematics there?
[00:46:16.885 --> 00:46:18.126]  Strange from the New York Times.
[00:46:18.646 --> 00:46:19.066]  Update!
[00:46:20.422 --> 00:46:23.264]  Gold hits 10-week high, breaks currency link.
[00:46:23.444 --> 00:46:34.053]  Reuters, gold rose to its highest level in 10 weeks in Europe on Thursday morning, despite a slightly stronger dollar and a new wave of economic and geopolitical anxiety thrust safe haven assets back into the limelight.
[00:46:34.453 --> 00:46:35.233]  Continuing, U.S.
[00:46:35.273 --> 00:46:37.395]  retail sales and import prices fall sharply.
[00:46:37.755 --> 00:46:37.855]  U.S.
[00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:42.099]  retail sales and import prices dropped sharply last month, fanning fears of deflation.
[00:46:42.399 --> 00:46:44.541]  They're going to decrease the value of the currency, folks.
[00:46:44.561 --> 00:46:45.201]  That's inflation.
[00:46:45.441 --> 00:46:46.122]  Takes more to buy.
[00:46:46.822 --> 00:46:49.684]  And offering more evidence of the continued weakness of the U.S.
[00:46:49.704 --> 00:46:50.184]  economy.
[00:46:50.544 --> 00:47:01.150]  Stock prices fell, the Treasury bond yield sank a 40-year low, the dollar weakened slightly, and betting on future Federal Reserve interest rate cuts intensified in reaction to the data.
[00:47:01.571 --> 00:47:14.378]  The fall in sales was accompanied by consumer confidence data, suggesting that 73% of Americans consider the economy's condition to be negative, and a poll in which most respondents did not express confidence in President George W. Bush's handling of the economy.
[00:47:14.758 --> 00:47:15.519]  Financial Times.
[00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:17.219]  Here's another one from Reuters.
[00:47:17.279 --> 00:47:18.140]  Retail plunge.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.140]  Economic worry is up.
[00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:21.041]  U.S.
[00:47:21.081 --> 00:47:30.904]  retail sales fell unexpectedly in April, and import sales set a record decline, the government said on Wednesday, and reports that underscored worries about the economy's health.
[00:47:30.924 --> 00:47:40.487]  The Commerce Department said total retail purchases slid 0.1% in April, to contrast the predictions economists in Reuters poll, who expected a 0.1% rise.
[00:47:43.402 --> 00:47:49.284]  And I got a story here where Treasury Secretary Snow is bad-mouthing the dollar.
[00:47:49.304 --> 00:47:52.485]  They've been doing this for two years, three and a half at Davos.
[00:47:53.086 --> 00:47:56.487]  CBS Market Watch jaw-boning reality for Treasury Snow.
[00:47:56.987 --> 00:48:00.769]  Couldn't fight dollar drop if he wanted to, and he doesn't, the headline says.
[00:48:01.889 --> 00:48:04.330]  And I'll cover this when we get back.
[00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:05.010]  This is incredible.
[00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:06.531]  They're bad-mouthing the dollar.
[00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:09.552]  Greenspan is out bad-mouthing the economy!
[00:48:10.953 --> 00:48:12.033]  They want to hurt it!
[00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.591]  Do you understand how evil this is?
[00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:17.852]  They get you in a fiat system.
[00:48:18.132 --> 00:48:19.613]  They're shearing you down to the bone.
[00:48:20.133 --> 00:48:20.653]  That's okay.
[00:48:20.673 --> 00:48:25.436]  You'll still support them because we're in this phony war against terror the globalists created.
[00:48:25.876 --> 00:48:27.057]  And the border is wide open.
[00:48:27.077 --> 00:48:27.837]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:32.145 --> 00:48:39.515]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:48:39.795 --> 00:48:44.541]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:48:44.761 --> 00:48:50.409]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:48:50.629 --> 00:48:51.369]  We're good to go.
[00:49:07.257 --> 00:49:09.780]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.766]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:49:16.966 --> 00:49:22.210]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.651]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:49:32.327 --> 00:49:36.829]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:41.272]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:41.552 --> 00:49:42.092]  We listened.
[00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:47.395]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:47.675 --> 00:49:48.156]  We listened.
[00:49:48.536 --> 00:49:51.577]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:51.998 --> 00:49:52.538]  We listened.
[00:49:52.998 --> 00:49:56.160]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:56.700]  I don't know.
[00:50:22.904 --> 00:50:26.547]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:50:27.368 --> 00:50:28.769]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:50:32.232 --> 00:50:38.156]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:50:38.396 --> 00:50:40.658]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:50:40.838 --> 00:50:47.183]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:50:47.583 --> 00:50:48.184]  I think so.
[00:51:07.807 --> 00:51:08.388]  We're good to go.
[00:51:34.012 --> 00:51:40.055]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:51:40.635 --> 00:51:43.657]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:45.818 --> 00:51:48.359]  I have been on the air for almost nine years.
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.862]  And a lot of you have been listening for three, four, five years.
[00:51:53.422 --> 00:51:55.303]  Six years since the show got syndicated.
[00:51:57.224 --> 00:52:00.125]  And you know, over and over again, I told you they were going to plunge the dollar.
[00:52:00.145 --> 00:52:03.227]  I told you they were going to have us in the middle of a war so you wouldn't blame the government.
[00:52:04.508 --> 00:52:07.629]  The Global has said they were going to use terror in all their big policy reports.
[00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:16.551]  These guys are so confident that you're busy watching football and baseball and not reading policy reports that you're in the dark.
[00:52:16.591 --> 00:52:19.392]  I mean, they go around bragging what they're going to do.
[00:52:19.412 --> 00:52:21.653]  I have to sit here and watch them.
[00:52:21.693 --> 00:52:27.974]  It's like a cop watching a serial killer announce what he's going to do and go out and do it, burying bodies publicly.
[00:52:28.254 --> 00:52:30.795]  Everyone's walking around going, ho-hum, la-dee-dee.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.182]  It's very, very frustrating.
[00:52:34.602 --> 00:52:36.844]  Gene, you're on the air.
[00:52:36.864 --> 00:52:37.845]  Where are you calling us from?
[00:52:37.865 --> 00:52:41.428]  Go ahead and go to Gene now.
[00:52:41.488 --> 00:52:42.549]  Gene, where are you calling us from?
[00:52:44.791 --> 00:52:46.032]  Gene is not talking.
[00:52:46.953 --> 00:52:48.615]  Okay, we'll go to some more calls in a second.
[00:52:50.516 --> 00:52:51.437]  I'm very frustrated.
[00:52:51.457 --> 00:52:53.239]  I don't know where to start, what news to cover.
[00:52:54.818 --> 00:52:55.218]  Look at this.
[00:52:55.318 --> 00:52:58.720]  Sell recommendations rise 400% financial times of one.
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:07.405]  The number of stock sell recommendations by Wall Street analysts quadrupled in the past year as banks and brokerage houses scrambled to revamp their research.
[00:53:09.226 --> 00:53:17.150]  As one of the beginning on May, sells constituted 10.5% of the total advance compared with only 2.5% of a year ago.
[00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:18.871]  All right, Gina Missouri, go ahead.
[00:53:18.891 --> 00:53:19.471]  You're on the air.
[00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:20.992]  Yes, Alex.
[00:53:21.312 --> 00:53:23.093]  I just wanted to
[00:53:25.862 --> 00:53:30.685]  I hope that you have a safe trip up to your speaking engagement on Saturday with Colonel Craig Roberts.
[00:53:30.945 --> 00:53:31.046]  Okay.
[00:53:31.086 --> 00:53:31.326]  Thank you.
[00:53:31.706 --> 00:53:34.848]  And I would like to come to that, but it doesn't look like I'm going to be able to.
[00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:42.593]  But I was going to try to tell some people I know that live in the area about the event.
[00:53:42.633 --> 00:53:43.754]  Well, that's fantastic.
[00:53:43.794 --> 00:53:44.194]  Thank you.
[00:53:44.375 --> 00:53:46.536]  I don't know if they'll come because I don't know anything yet.
[00:53:46.556 --> 00:53:46.636]  Okay.
[00:53:46.776 --> 00:53:47.277]  Well, what's on your mind?
[00:53:47.297 --> 00:53:53.761]  No, I shouldn't say they don't know anything, but I don't think they know about your... I don't think... They may not know about your... Maybe they do.
[00:53:53.841 --> 00:53:54.121]  Okay.
[00:53:54.141 --> 00:53:54.441]  I don't know.
[00:53:56.279 --> 00:54:06.883]  But what I also wanted to mention is when Colonel Craig Roberts was talking a few moments ago and he mentioned Oceania, they actually had the movie on 1984 this weekend.
[00:54:08.164 --> 00:54:08.704]  Well, yeah.
[00:54:08.724 --> 00:54:13.446]  Well, you know, actually in some of the foreign markets they call Europe and England and the U.S.
[00:54:13.586 --> 00:54:14.306]  Oceania.
[00:54:14.326 --> 00:54:16.047]  So that's a term that was used before then.
[00:54:16.487 --> 00:54:16.767]  Wow.
[00:54:17.127 --> 00:54:17.428]  Yeah.
[00:54:17.888 --> 00:54:23.050]  Well, they aired 1984 on BBC over the weekend and I actually taped it.
[00:54:24.068 --> 00:54:26.729]  Was it the 1950's version or the 1984 version?
[00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:29.329]  Uh, well it had Richard Burton in it.
[00:54:29.489 --> 00:54:30.829]  That was the 1984 version.
[00:54:30.989 --> 00:54:33.030]  Okay, it had Richard Burton and John Hurt.
[00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:36.330]  Yeah, you ought to see the 1954 version, man, that was incredible.
[00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.931]  Is that the one that's real dark and you can't hardly see it at all?
[00:54:40.431 --> 00:54:44.012]  Well, maybe you've seen a bad copy, but yeah, it was black and white made in the 50's.
[00:54:44.152 --> 00:54:47.652]  Yeah, I think I checked that out from the library and it was very depressing.
[00:54:48.472 --> 00:54:50.713]  Yeah, it's a lot more hardcore, more accurate to the book.
[00:54:51.153 --> 00:54:51.353]  Yeah.
[00:54:52.785 --> 00:55:03.330]  Well, again, I appreciate all that you're doing to help us get woke up out here and to help you and your wife or whoever's going with you have a safe trip up to Kansas City and back.
[00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:04.271]  Thank you, Eugene.
[00:55:04.311 --> 00:55:05.011]  I appreciate the call.
[00:55:05.031 --> 00:55:07.192]  We'll come back and take more calls and I've got a guest coming up.
[00:55:07.572 --> 00:55:13.656]  Before I end this segment, the new film is out, Police Day 3, Total Enslavement, 2 hours, 37 minutes long.
[00:55:15.752 --> 00:55:16.852]  Everybody should get this.
[00:55:16.953 --> 00:55:25.216]  Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, dozens of other examples of government-sponsored terrorism from around the world, stuff I haven't covered in Road to Tyranny or Masters of Terror.
[00:55:26.536 --> 00:55:27.877]  Just a lot of amazing stuff.
[00:55:27.977 --> 00:55:29.898]  I really can't describe it here in hours.
[00:55:29.978 --> 00:55:31.138]  I couldn't describe it in the film.
[00:55:31.158 --> 00:55:33.019]  It's fast-moving, jam-packed.
[00:55:33.059 --> 00:55:34.459]  I recommend you watch it in three parts.
[00:55:34.619 --> 00:55:36.240]  It's that jam-packed.
[00:55:37.484 --> 00:55:39.205]  $25.95.
[00:55:37.604 --> 00:55:39.205]  I've made nine films.
[00:55:39.366 --> 00:55:42.229]  They're $20 when you order three or more of any of the nine titles.
[00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:43.830]  My book's 230 pages.
[00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:44.011]  Only $12.
[00:55:45.092 --> 00:55:47.574]  Dissenting to tyranny about 9-1-1 and the takeover.
[00:55:48.075 --> 00:55:48.876]  Get the videos.
[00:55:48.956 --> 00:55:51.739]  Make copies for non-profit, educational, not for self-purposes.
[00:55:52.019 --> 00:55:53.120]  Get them out to everybody.

[00:55:55.142 --> 00:55:56.123]  Operators are there at 1-888.

[00:56:15.655 --> 00:56:17.738]  Second and third hours straight ahead.
[00:56:21.483 --> 00:56:22.243]  Are you prepared?
[00:56:22.423 --> 00:56:24.824]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[00:56:25.044 --> 00:56:29.466]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[00:56:29.786 --> 00:56:32.527]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our aggravity.
[00:56:36.409 --> 00:56:39.590]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.248 --> 00:56:47.908]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.548 --> 00:56:49.629]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:51.549]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.909]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.649 --> 00:56:54.550]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:58.890]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:03.531]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:07.792 --> 00:57:13.573]  Last year in Portugal, hundreds of former high-level military officers and others met for a 76-hour
[00:57:15.188 --> 00:57:19.272]  There was a press conference where they publicly accused the U.S.
[00:57:19.312 --> 00:57:20.793]  government for carrying out 9-1-1.
[00:57:21.013 --> 00:57:27.018]  It was carried by Spanish and Portuguese papers and by a few English papers.
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:31.703]  And they went over the evidence of how there was no way 19 hijackers did that.
[00:57:31.783 --> 00:57:33.624]  Now a bunch of them have been found alive.
[00:57:34.165 --> 00:57:35.226]  The others were trained at U.S.
[00:57:35.286 --> 00:57:36.187]  military bases.
[00:57:36.207 --> 00:57:38.889]  Their credit cards, their homes, paid for by the FBI.
[00:57:39.369 --> 00:57:42.052]  We've had David Shippers and everybody else on about this.
[00:57:43.314 --> 00:57:48.096]  Judicial Watch has talked about how the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens on national TV has talked about it.
[00:57:48.956 --> 00:57:51.157]  The evidence... I've made two films and read the book, folks.
[00:57:51.197 --> 00:57:51.757]  It's a fact.
[00:57:52.197 --> 00:58:01.781]  As the German technology minister said, the globalists, the military-industrial complex carried this out to set up open-world dictatorship.
[00:58:01.841 --> 00:58:02.101]  Okay?
[00:58:02.141 --> 00:58:02.741]  That's the quote.
[00:58:03.162 --> 00:58:04.822]  German ministers are saying it, okay?
[00:58:05.202 --> 00:58:07.143]  I'm not the only one, and I know we're on in D.C.
[00:58:07.163 --> 00:58:07.823]  and everywhere else.
[00:58:08.184 --> 00:58:09.804]  There's thousands of us that are prominent.
[00:58:10.184 --> 00:58:11.465]  Someone who's very prominent is
[00:58:12.737 --> 00:58:17.401]  Barry Schweiker, and he's written for all the big major papers, many of the big papers.
[00:58:17.461 --> 00:58:28.310]  He's the Visions TV media critic, highly respected, and he's convincing a lot of top journalists that he is correct of some big questions of prior knowledge up in Canada.
[00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:30.912]  And we're honored to have Barry.
[00:58:31.596 --> 00:58:33.278]  Barry on the show, sir.
[00:58:33.358 --> 00:58:35.019]  Thank you for taking some time out to be with us.
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:37.882]  Listen, it's a real pleasure, Alex.
[00:58:38.582 --> 00:58:45.428]  I encountered your face for the first time at the end of that new video called Aftermath, you know?
[00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:47.970]  Unanswered questions from 9-11?
[00:58:49.251 --> 00:59:01.538]  I saw that video in San Francisco last month, and I really liked what they had you as the last guy punching out a real call for people to wake up, and I really admired that.
[00:59:01.778 --> 00:59:03.919]  So I'm really gratified to be speaking with you.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.200]  Well, thank you.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:10.923]  You know, I'll be honest, if it was some new free country to go to, I'd probably leave, but there's nowhere to run.
[00:59:10.963 --> 00:59:11.944]  It is a new world order.
[00:59:12.564 --> 00:59:15.406]  I don't think people realize how serious things have gotten.
[00:59:16.147 --> 00:59:20.450]  Tell us a little about yourself and the questions you have and some of the key points.
[00:59:21.131 --> 00:59:23.052]  Well, one thing I have to correct you.
[00:59:23.332 --> 00:59:24.653]  I wish I didn't have to correct you.
[00:59:24.853 --> 00:59:29.737]  You said a moment ago that I'm convincing a lot of journalists in Canada that these questions should be asked.
[00:59:29.957 --> 00:59:32.179]  Well, that's what the Toronto Star said.
[00:59:32.479 --> 00:59:37.363]  Well, the Toronto Star is the largest circulation newspaper in Canada.
[00:59:37.383 --> 00:59:38.944]  It's a proud paper.
[00:59:39.004 --> 00:59:39.785]  I worked for it.
[00:59:39.885 --> 00:59:41.446]  Formerly I was the education editor.
[00:59:42.046 --> 00:59:42.867]  Back in the 70s.
[00:59:43.648 --> 00:59:47.291]  And their best-read columnist is a woman named Michelle Landsberg.
[00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:49.533]  And it happens I've known Michelle for a long time.
[00:59:49.593 --> 00:59:53.156]  We used to work together on the Globe and Mail, which is Canada's national newspaper.
[00:59:54.517 --> 01:00:02.604]  What happened was Michelle wrote a column some time ago, maybe a couple or three months ago,
[01:00:03.732 --> 01:00:04.792]  And she mentioned how the U.S.
[01:00:04.832 --> 01:00:07.873]  government is addicted to lying about things.
[01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:17.095]  And she gave a few examples, and I think perhaps she mentioned the infamous Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that became the basis for the whole U.S.
[01:00:17.115 --> 01:00:17.955]  war in Vietnam.
[01:00:17.995 --> 01:00:22.096]  And before that was over, there were 58,000 of your countrymen were dead.
[01:00:22.276 --> 01:00:25.337]  There were no communists, nor Vietnamese boats attacking anything.
[01:00:25.357 --> 01:00:26.237]  It was totally made up.
[01:00:26.377 --> 01:00:34.508]  It was completely a fake, totally a fake, and yet it passed unanimously in the House of Representatives and 88-2 in the Senate.
[01:00:35.069 --> 01:00:36.891]  So she mentioned a couple of things like that.
[01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:42.880]  Well, what happened was she got a tremendous response via email, and with the internet these days, that's how it goes.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:53.828]  And a lot of the people who emailed her from the USA, from down where you are, said, Michelle, there's a guy in Canada named Barry Zwicker, and he's done a whole video about this.
[01:00:54.369 --> 01:01:02.094]  Well, amazingly, although she and I know each other, and actually she lives a 10 minute bicycle ride from here, she had never heard of him about my video.
[01:01:02.835 --> 01:01:05.837]  So she phoned up and she said, Barry, I understand you got a video out.
[01:01:06.138 --> 01:01:06.798]  I'd like to see it.
[01:01:06.838 --> 01:01:07.439]  I said, sure.
[01:01:07.499 --> 01:01:09.160]  So I rode it over there in my bicycle.
[01:01:10.311 --> 01:01:17.116]  And she watched it and she said, she told me right here where I'm sitting in my writing studio, she came over and interviewed me a week ago, Wednesday.
[01:01:17.176 --> 01:01:23.480]  She said, Barry, a cold chill literally came over my body when I was watching your video.
[01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:25.762]  And I said, well, what do you mean?
[01:01:25.802 --> 01:01:26.122]  Stay there.
[01:01:26.142 --> 01:01:26.763]  We got a break.
[01:01:27.243 --> 01:01:29.565]  Our guest is Barry Dwiker.
[01:01:30.105 --> 01:01:34.228]  He is a highly respected journalist in Canada, TV critic.
[01:01:34.828 --> 01:01:35.749]  Provision TV.
[01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:39.433]  We'll be right back in three minutes with him and he's doing great work fighting the Globalists.
[01:01:39.453 --> 01:01:39.914]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:44.031 --> 01:01:48.593]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:01:48.893 --> 01:01:52.995]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:01:53.275 --> 01:01:53.835]  We listened.
[01:01:54.135 --> 01:01:59.117]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:01:59.397 --> 01:01:59.877]  We listened.
[01:02:00.257 --> 01:02:03.299]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:04.259]  We listened.
[01:02:04.719 --> 01:02:08.761]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:02:09.241 --> 01:02:09.661]  We listened.
[01:02:10.002 --> 01:02:15.226]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:02:15.647 --> 01:02:17.008]  Again, we listened.
[01:02:17.368 --> 01:02:24.754]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[01:02:42.432 --> 01:02:49.239]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.941]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:02:51.161 --> 01:02:53.364]  The original film was 144 minutes long.

[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.960]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:04:43.816 --> 01:04:49.838]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:50.458 --> 01:04:53.499]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:53.899 --> 01:04:56.460]  We're talking to Barry Zwicker.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:59.180]  He has written for many of the big papers.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.261]  Love and Mail, Toronto Star.
[01:05:01.921 --> 01:05:04.442]  He is the Vision TV Media Critic.
[01:05:05.522 --> 01:05:06.282]  Highly respected.
[01:05:07.265 --> 01:05:16.372]  And he's come out and said, hey, the government's lying, there's all sorts of weirdness going on, and other reporters have seen his film and said it sends a cold chill up their spine.
[01:05:16.392 --> 01:05:19.254]  You were continuing, Barry, with your story.
[01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:19.714]  Go ahead.
[01:05:20.015 --> 01:05:20.595]  Well, sure.
[01:05:20.655 --> 01:05:21.196]  Why not?
[01:05:21.236 --> 01:05:21.756]  It's a story.
[01:05:22.116 --> 01:05:28.281]  It's not other journalists, but this particular journalist, Michelle Landsberg, and she is really highly respected in this country.
[01:05:28.981 --> 01:05:32.764]  And so she asked, as I was saying, for my video.
[01:05:32.824 --> 01:05:33.425]  She watched it.
[01:05:33.465 --> 01:05:38.228]  She told me here in my writing studio, she said a cold chill came over her whole body.
[01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:39.289]  And I said, well, what do you mean?
[01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.691]  And she said, well, it wasn't so much what you said.
[01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:45.894]  It was that I myself had thought these thoughts.
[01:05:46.094 --> 01:05:48.035]  She was in France, actually, on 9-11.
[01:05:48.075 --> 01:05:51.378]  She watched on French TV and she couldn't hear any English language.
[01:05:52.018 --> 01:05:52.098]  It's
[01:06:09.727 --> 01:06:17.033]  Well, the subconscious mind is very powerful when it's faced with something horrifying.
[01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:17.933]  It's like with Hitler.
[01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:22.037]  People kept trying to deny and deny and deny and deny and deny.
[01:06:22.497 --> 01:06:23.678]  That is so right.
[01:06:23.758 --> 01:06:25.860]  And you know, I couldn't agree more.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:33.105]  I've just read the new two-volume biography on Hitler by the British historian Ian Kershaw.
[01:06:33.606 --> 01:06:36.148]  And I think it's the very best biography that's ever come out.
[01:06:37.148 --> 01:06:45.133]  And he points that out, that group after group after group in Germany would be the labor unions, the churches, the industrialists, the workers, the farmers and everything.
[01:06:45.413 --> 01:06:48.095]  They all found reasons to go along with Hitler.
[01:06:48.475 --> 01:06:50.997]  Of course, they had to be lied to a lot.
[01:06:51.037 --> 01:06:52.938]  Hitler always said he wanted peace, you know.
[01:06:53.158 --> 01:06:54.159]  Always said he wanted peace.
[01:06:54.259 --> 01:06:55.159]  Lied to his teeth.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.641]  Laying war plans, saying he wants peace.
[01:06:58.181 --> 01:07:02.205]  And, of course, then he had the Reichstag fire, which really mobilized the German public.
[01:07:02.406 --> 01:07:03.807]  I mean, that was an iconic thing.
[01:07:04.287 --> 01:07:06.149]  1933, their parliament burned down.
[01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:07.471]  Blamed it on a communist.
[01:07:08.051 --> 01:07:10.734]  And that was how he seized the last bit of power.
[01:07:10.774 --> 01:07:12.616]  He never was properly elected.
[01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:18.101]  It was something like another guy... And he set up Homeland Security, called Fatherland Security.
[01:07:18.381 --> 01:07:18.802]  Exactly.
[01:07:18.842 --> 01:07:20.904]  This word, Homeland, has bad resonances.
[01:07:21.264 --> 01:07:24.507]  But you know, Alex, I don't know how much we should take for granted.
[01:07:24.527 --> 01:07:27.870]  Well, we should take nothing for granted about what your listeners believe.
[01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:42.963]  All the varieties of belief they would have on this subject of 9-11 vary from some people who would totally accept the standard narrative that's put out by the government, right on through to those, I include myself among them, who are total skeptics.
[01:07:43.063 --> 01:07:44.445]  I believe there was complicity.
[01:07:44.465 --> 01:07:45.986]  It wasn't just that they let it happen.
[01:07:46.146 --> 01:07:46.847]  There you go!
[01:07:47.067 --> 01:07:48.068]  They helped to make it happen.
[01:07:48.508 --> 01:07:49.169]  Oh, they did it!
[01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:54.436]  Yeah, it's an inside job is really the word they use in crime.
[01:07:54.616 --> 01:08:07.072]  But anyway, what has happened is I started to write a book about this and the book of course is dragging along because my life is pretty busy and it's a big subject and the book started to teach me things.
[01:08:07.689 --> 01:08:13.074]  And what the book is called, Connecting the Dots, The Media, 9-11, and Our Future.
[01:08:13.634 --> 01:08:19.839]  And so what the book is teaching me is that the real subject of the book, Alex, is the nature of belief.
[01:08:20.219 --> 01:08:24.203]  Yeah, the culture denying in massive denial.
[01:08:24.883 --> 01:08:27.745]  Yeah, and it's so true.
[01:08:28.186 --> 01:08:33.290]  Now, what my understanding, such as it is, I don't claim to be the smartest guy in the world,
[01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:41.179]  But my understanding as it's evolved is this, that denial itself is not a very important thing.
[01:08:41.239 --> 01:08:43.021]  That is, it's the surface.
[01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:45.043]  Here'd be a comparison I've come up with.
[01:08:45.363 --> 01:08:48.347]  You see an automobile accident, you know, at a corner.
[01:08:49.298 --> 01:08:52.779]  So the automobile accident happened and maybe a couple people hurt and that's that.
[01:08:53.119 --> 01:08:59.340]  Well, that's obvious for everybody to see, although granted people might have different ideas about how it happened.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.141]  But the real questions are, why did that thing happen?
[01:09:03.501 --> 01:09:04.781]  How come it happened?
[01:09:04.921 --> 01:09:06.662]  What went into making it happen?
[01:09:06.722 --> 01:09:11.303]  What was the anatomy of the preparation for this accident that then occurred?
[01:09:11.703 --> 01:09:16.384]  Now when you come to denial, denial is the surface, the last thing that happens.
[01:09:17.064 --> 01:09:17.565]  I think so.
[01:09:35.245 --> 01:09:38.286]  Four scheduled airliners flew all over Hell's Half Acre.
[01:09:38.326 --> 01:09:41.408]  You've seen the maps about how they're flying all over the place.
[01:09:41.468 --> 01:09:43.389]  Transponders off.
[01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:49.213]  When the golfer's plane was out for 15-20 minutes, Hanes Stewart is surrounded by F-16s.
[01:09:49.233 --> 01:09:51.214]  The most guarded space in the world.
[01:09:51.334 --> 01:09:52.034]  Nothing's done.
[01:09:52.054 --> 01:10:02.260]  And the President, we now find out, this is admitted, mainstream news, knew at his hotel, in the car, went into the little ghost story so he couldn't be reached, so he couldn't order the shoot down.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:03.600]  Well, exactly.
[01:10:03.641 --> 01:10:05.541]  I mean, the whole thing about George Bush.
[01:10:05.861 --> 01:10:21.248]  And again, the thing is that we all saw, either originally and or in repeats, endless repeats, we saw the famous video of Andy Card going into that classroom with those great two kids in it and whispering into George Bush's ear.
[01:10:21.528 --> 01:10:22.809]  Now, here's a really odd thing.
[01:10:22.849 --> 01:10:24.150]  There's so many odd things about this.
[01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:30.292]  But just let me touch on that for a minute, although you may have already touched on it, perhaps even many times, Alex.
[01:10:30.312 --> 01:10:31.833]  You must continue to touch on it.
[01:10:32.473 --> 01:10:39.379]  Okay, and exactly, we have to keep repeating these things, you know, you've got to repeat them until you gain some mind share.
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:56.714]  So Andy Card, he whispers in George Bush's ear, now we're told by everybody concerned, we're told by George Bush, by Andy Card, by the official White House transcript and everything, that what Andy Card said to George Bush was something to this effect that a second tower has been hit, America is under attack.
[01:10:57.455 --> 01:10:58.336]  Now, what
[01:10:58.866 --> 01:10:59.367]  I think so.
[01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:17.571]  He doesn't say, do you want to do something, Mr. President?
[01:11:17.631 --> 01:11:19.351]  Or should we go, Mr. President?
[01:11:19.471 --> 01:11:21.992]  Or do you have anything to say about that, Mr. President?
[01:11:22.232 --> 01:11:23.672]  Will we see you later, Mr. President?
[01:11:23.732 --> 01:11:23.872]  No.
[01:11:24.232 --> 01:11:25.853]  Andy Carr just backs off and walks away.
[01:11:26.193 --> 01:11:30.654]  His actions are extremely dubious and they're anomalous in the extreme, also.
[01:11:30.674 --> 01:11:32.954]  Well, then George Bush... Well, that was a scheduled stop, too.
[01:11:32.994 --> 01:11:35.895]  The Secret Service would not let the President do that.
[01:11:36.275 --> 01:11:37.435]  No, it was known.
[01:11:37.976 --> 01:11:43.477]  It was known, publicly known, because his itinerary had been announced exactly where the President was.
[01:11:43.877 --> 01:11:51.361]  So if America was really under terrorist attack, then that would mean that the President would be probably the number one potential victim.
[01:11:51.401 --> 01:11:53.363]  Now here's the problem with talking about 9-1-1.
[01:11:54.083 --> 01:11:59.146]  What we're talking about is 1% of the total red flag smoking gun evidence.
[01:12:00.225 --> 01:12:05.411]  I want people to understand that because you can hear what we're saying, try to argue with it, try to... This is a complex issue.
[01:12:05.451 --> 01:12:17.163]  When you start looking at who trained the hijackers, who founded Al-Qaeda, who stood to gain, start looking at the public officials like mayors of San Francisco and Ashcroft and generals being told not to fly to New York that day.
[01:12:17.483 --> 01:12:23.190]  You start adding the insider trading, you start adding hundreds of other smoking gun points, then it's totally clear.
[01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:25.712]  But this is central, what you're talking about.
[01:12:25.933 --> 01:12:36.444]  The stand down for an hour and 50 minutes plus, the staged press conference, the staged photo op, where we learn with him, and it's so sick.
[01:12:36.484 --> 01:12:36.845]  Go ahead.
[01:12:37.125 --> 01:12:48.289]  Well, yeah, and in my video called The Great Deception, I just say, I sort of loop that video of the President being informed.
[01:12:48.369 --> 01:12:50.989]  I loop it, you know, it goes back around about six times.
[01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:54.010]  And I say, this guy is play-acting.
[01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:55.031]  This is a play.
[01:12:55.271 --> 01:12:56.271]  This man is acting.
[01:12:56.431 --> 01:12:57.472]  Right here, right now.
[01:12:57.592 --> 01:12:57.812]  See?
[01:12:57.972 --> 01:12:59.172]  Look, he's acting.
[01:12:59.212 --> 01:13:02.033]  But later it came out that he was, that he already knew all of it.
[01:13:02.453 --> 01:13:04.035]  Well, yeah.
[01:13:04.055 --> 01:13:14.445]  See, there's the anomaly that when he was speaking to those kids later at some public town hall meeting in Florida, a short while later in Little... What was his name?
[01:13:14.485 --> 01:13:15.406]  I've got it in my video.
[01:13:15.446 --> 01:13:19.410]  Little Jenkins or Jason asked him a question.
[01:13:20.031 --> 01:13:34.351]  And then that's when George Bush says, well, I was sitting outside that classroom, I was watching the TV outside that classroom, and I saw a plane go into the tower, and I used to be a pilot myself, and I said, boy, that's one bad pilot, but then I didn't think about it anymore.
[01:13:34.531 --> 01:13:36.694]  Well, I mean, that is absolutely ludicrous on the...
[01:13:36.834 --> 01:13:38.676]  No one saw the first plane hit.
[01:13:38.696 --> 01:13:40.479]  There were no videos of that until days later.
[01:13:40.739 --> 01:13:41.180]  Exactly.
[01:13:41.801 --> 01:13:48.029]  I was working on this series of six commentaries about this, which I started on.
[01:13:48.129 --> 01:13:51.494]  I finally got my nerve up enough to start this in January 2002.
[01:13:51.534 --> 01:13:52.395]  My first one appeared on
[01:13:55.137 --> 01:14:22.712]  on on night january the fourteenth with their january fourteenth on national canadian television and i thought that i was really really late in raising that i was feeling really bad in my own conscience yeah i'm not bragging but i had a film out one month after well bless you i mean you are on top man and i'll play in my defense that i knew that day it happened i knew the day it happened that it was it that that it was what what we've come to realize it is thoroughly
[01:14:23.403 --> 01:14:32.828]  And anyway, it's interesting when you ask people as I do, in connection with writing my book, I ask them, when did you twig?
[01:14:33.008 --> 01:14:35.709]  When did you twig that this was fishy and why?
[01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:37.330]  You get these always different answers.
[01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:42.533]  And you, of course, well know, and you've probably had him on your program, Michel Chossudovsky.
[01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:44.173]  You know him?
[01:14:44.193 --> 01:14:44.873]  The University of Iowa?
[01:14:44.913 --> 01:14:45.834]  Yes, we've had him on.
[01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:48.057]  He's put some of my articles in his magazine.
[01:14:48.177 --> 01:14:48.698]  Exactly.
[01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:50.399]  He's well known to you.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.061]  Tremendous researcher.
[01:14:52.101 --> 01:14:52.962]  Tremendous person.
[01:14:55.245 --> 01:14:57.327]  I asked him personally, I said, when did you twig?
[01:14:57.367 --> 01:15:04.035]  And he said, well, he was driving from his home, which is about an hour and a half drive from his university office.
[01:15:04.595 --> 01:15:08.896]  And just before he left home, someone said, something's going on, and so he's listening to the car radio.
[01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:14.397]  And by the time he arrived, an hour and a half later, arrived at his office, the U.S.
[01:15:14.417 --> 01:15:19.218]  government was already naming Osama bin Laden as the key perpetrator.
[01:15:19.618 --> 01:15:20.718]  And that did it for him.
[01:15:20.758 --> 01:15:24.759]  He said, there's no way, an hour and a half after this happened, that you know who does it.
[01:15:25.039 --> 01:15:28.040]  Oh, but they found a passport in the rubble, uncharged.
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.420]  Just fluttered down from heaven, manna from heaven, eh?
[01:15:31.478 --> 01:15:39.745]  Now, Alex, there's something you mentioned, and I'd like to follow up on it with you, if you'd like.
[01:15:40.086 --> 01:15:43.168]  I think it's really, really important, because you got talking about deeper background.
[01:15:43.288 --> 01:15:45.750]  For instance, you said, who trained Al-Qaeda?
[01:15:46.171 --> 01:15:49.494]  Now, this is very important, and I find that this is an obstacle for some people.
[01:15:49.874 --> 01:15:56.760]  You see, they still really believe that there are terrorists who are just, oh, crazy people, or they're
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:13.284]  Arabs especially, or Muslim fanatics, or they could be any kind of race, color, or creed, or whatever, but they're these individual homegrown fanatics who are just really angry and twisted and so forth, and then they throw bombs or they do whatever.
[01:16:13.304 --> 01:16:17.524]  Now, of course, down through history there have been many such people, no question.
[01:16:17.905 --> 01:16:23.926]  And I think one reason that people can believe this version of terrorism, because I want to come to the second version of terrorism in a minute,
[01:16:24.366 --> 01:16:37.839]  The reason that people can identify with and believe in that kind of terrorist, your retail terrorist, is because a lot of us, ordinary human beings, we've been so damn angry different times about something that we ourselves have thought... Hey, watch!
[01:16:37.859 --> 01:16:38.260]  Stay there!
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.641]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:40.001 --> 01:16:40.702]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:42.782 --> 01:16:47.047]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:16:47.487 --> 01:16:52.032]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:16:52.413 --> 01:16:57.278]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:16:57.658 --> 01:16:59.440]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.501]  can barely be read.
[01:17:00.521 --> 01:17:01.763]  It is faded that much.
[01:17:02.103 --> 01:17:06.006]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[01:17:06.266 --> 01:17:14.653]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.
[01:17:14.913 --> 01:17:22.780]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents purchase $24.95 shipping included.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:27.023]  And as a special gift for ordering now, you will also receive a commemorative U.S.

[01:17:42.384 --> 01:17:43.365]  Toxins are everywhere.
[01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:45.986]  They're in the air you breathe, in the food you eat, in the water you drink.
[01:17:46.186 --> 01:17:53.971]  And as a result, illness and disease have increased to the point that eventually we're all going to get sick with something, unless we find a way to get these toxins and metals out of the body.
[01:17:54.431 --> 01:17:59.934]  EDTA chelation treatments cost about $100 each, and take several hours at the doctor's office, not to mention the discomfort.
[01:18:00.254 --> 01:18:01.735]  But now there's Detoxamine.
[01:18:02.075 --> 01:18:07.178]  This chelation suppository is a major breakthrough and is destined to revolutionize the way we detox our bodies.
[01:18:07.538 --> 01:18:09.379]  How much would you pay for 10 chelation treatments?
[01:18:09.679 --> 01:18:12.080]  Well, you can get approximately the same amount of chelating for only $289.95.
[01:18:13.801 --> 01:18:15.502]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:18:16.002 --> 01:18:18.543]  That's 877-817-9829.

[01:18:29.388 --> 01:18:32.952]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and
[01:18:47.705 --> 01:18:51.607]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:18:51.907 --> 01:18:52.447]  We listened.
[01:18:52.767 --> 01:18:57.750]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.510]  We listened.
[01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:01.932]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:02.352 --> 01:19:02.892]  We listened.
[01:19:03.353 --> 01:19:06.374]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:06.514]  I think?
[01:19:33.257 --> 01:19:34.179]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:19:34.219 --> 01:19:35.822]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.532]  Hey gang, it's time for a fresh, healthy start.

[01:20:38.938 --> 01:20:39.639]  1-800-622-THIN.
[01:20:39.659 --> 01:20:52.088]  Alright, we got Mary Zwicker on with us.
[01:20:52.108 --> 01:20:55.551]  She's written for all the big papers, award winning, on and on and on.
[01:20:55.591 --> 01:20:56.952]  Globe and Mail, Toronto Star.
[01:20:58.234 --> 01:20:59.134]  He's the media critic.
[01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:00.155]  He studies the media.
[01:21:00.615 --> 01:21:01.735]  He's a TV guy.
[01:21:01.975 --> 01:21:02.956]  He knows what's phony.
[01:21:04.356 --> 01:21:08.597]  More people are telling the truth, and as he said, he's seen the Guerrilla News Network.
[01:21:08.637 --> 01:21:09.638]  Great video they've put out.
[01:21:09.738 --> 01:21:10.718]  It's good for the general public.
[01:21:10.738 --> 01:21:11.558]  Thirty minutes long.
[01:21:12.118 --> 01:21:14.459]  Fortunately, my films are, many of them, almost three hours.
[01:21:15.119 --> 01:21:18.240]  So much evidence, I want to put it all in, but I can't even hit the tip of the iceberg.
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:22.622]  This is such a sloppily done thing they carried out, other than the remote controlling.
[01:21:23.282 --> 01:21:25.703]  But continuing,
[01:21:27.205 --> 01:21:31.707]  I've done a study of modern terrorism, and in every case, it's intelligence agencies.
[01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:35.669]  And sometimes they use useful idiots, but generally they just do it themselves and grab some patsy.
[01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:42.532]  And you were telling a story, Barry, but also you mentioned the Northwoods document, where the U.S.
[01:21:42.552 --> 01:21:46.013]  government calls for hijacking jet airliners, bombing D.C.
[01:21:46.474 --> 01:21:48.815]  ABC News, Baltimore Sun first reported it before 9-1-1.
[01:21:50.163 --> 01:21:52.145]  When you have stuff like this, people say, well, how?
[01:21:52.285 --> 01:21:52.626]  Why?
[01:21:52.706 --> 01:21:53.386]  Why would they do it?
[01:21:53.586 --> 01:21:58.051]  They tell us in the Northwoods document how they're going to kill people, how they're going to frame Patsy's.
[01:21:59.032 --> 01:22:00.633]  This is an amazing document, isn't it?
[01:22:01.034 --> 01:22:03.977]  It certainly is, and I did use that in my video, too.
[01:22:04.077 --> 01:22:06.399]  I read James Bamford's Body of Secrets.
[01:22:06.699 --> 01:22:10.223]  There are other sources for that information, too, but he has some good stuff.
[01:22:10.263 --> 01:22:13.586]  And I'll tell you one thing... Well, the National Security Archives has the public document.
[01:22:14.006 --> 01:22:14.186]  Yep.
[01:22:14.446 --> 01:22:15.987]  Yeah, I've seen a photocopy of it.
[01:22:16.567 --> 01:22:29.471]  And General Lyman Lemnitzer was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in those days, and that guy was so right-wing that he was really... you really had to wonder about his... Well, it's not even right-wing.
[01:22:30.572 --> 01:22:31.472]  It's command and control.
[01:22:32.259 --> 01:22:32.819]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.560]  It's a lot about command and control.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:37.682]  You were trying to talk about the other forms of terror, too.
[01:22:37.942 --> 01:22:39.383]  Yeah, the other forms of terror, too.
[01:22:39.483 --> 01:22:52.871]  But one thing about Operation Northwood, which just might be mentioned parenthetically here, that really shocks people when I have some, you know how we do in our videos, we've got that B-roll so we can show a few things to back up text.
[01:22:53.671 --> 01:23:09.602]  And with Operation Northwood, some people think that it was just one plan to have some Americans, actually Americans killed, just like a replay of the meme, so that this would antagonize the American public and mobilize them for a war on Cuba.
[01:23:09.762 --> 01:23:11.603]  That was the aim of it.
[01:23:11.663 --> 01:23:14.805]  The quote on page 4 is casually listed in U.S.
[01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:17.627]  newspapers will cause a helpful wave of indignation.
[01:23:17.647 --> 01:23:18.928]  A helpful wave of indignation.
[01:23:18.948 --> 01:23:23.111]  You've got the exact quote there, and that's the exact quote that I quoted, but you'll remember in the book,
[01:23:23.471 --> 01:23:25.772]  Something that some other people haven't mentioned.
[01:23:26.272 --> 01:23:28.973]  They had alternative scenarios they were going to use.
[01:23:29.013 --> 01:23:36.475]  And at that time, John Glenn was about to go up for his first liftoff into space, which was successful, of course.
[01:23:37.075 --> 01:23:48.339]  And they had a plan, it was all ready to go, that if something had gone wrong with John Glenn's capsule, and if it had burned, crashed, or anything, they were ready.
[01:23:48.399 --> 01:23:52.200]  They already had manufactured fake parts to prove
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:24:01.284]  Quote, unquote, that Cubans had interfered with his flight through radio signals, and that would be the reason for the war on Cuba.
[01:24:01.444 --> 01:24:10.349]  So, you know, they're so nasty, they're so imaginative, in a diseased way, that they have different scenarios they will spin out to accomplish the given end.
[01:24:11.187 --> 01:24:23.536]  And even in the case of Vietnam, you know, it was the alleged, but totally fake, non-existent North Vietnamese PT boats that allegedly attacked the Maddox and the Turner Joy.
[01:24:23.877 --> 01:24:31.863]  But they've already been doing a lot of stuff to antagonize and spur some kind of trouble for several months before that.
[01:24:32.323 --> 01:24:35.005]  But this was the one that... Finally, you know what?
[01:24:35.225 --> 01:24:37.467]  The North Vietnamese were too smart and they wouldn't bite.
[01:24:38.087 --> 01:24:40.889]  And so they finally had to just make it up out of whole cloth.
[01:24:41.269 --> 01:24:43.190]  And that's a similar case with Cuba.
[01:24:43.210 --> 01:24:48.894]  You know, many times there have been low-level flights, very provocative, roaring right over mainland Cuba.
[01:24:49.374 --> 01:24:51.896]  And the Cubans are told, do not shoot at them.
[01:24:52.536 --> 01:24:53.477]  Let them go.
[01:24:53.497 --> 01:24:57.920]  Because if you shoot at them, you're going to have a ton of suffering.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:04.924]  And they created Fidel, they funded Ho Chi Minh, they fund these guys, build them up and then make an enemy out of them.
[01:25:04.944 --> 01:25:07.086]  So there's a whole other level to creating the crisis.
[01:25:07.606 --> 01:25:11.608]  Now, you were trying to talk about, and I want to try to hold you over and take some calls if you can, we've got a break here in a second.
[01:25:11.868 --> 01:25:13.308]  We're trying to talk about the second type of terror.
[01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:17.910]  Modern big industrial terror, complex terror, can only be carried out by states.
[01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:22.252]  That's what the top generals and people said in this press conference in Portugal last year.
[01:25:22.632 --> 01:25:23.813]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:25:23.853 --> 01:25:30.118]  And it's very, very important that this be said repeatedly on air, because it's wholesale terrorism and state terrorism.
[01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:31.299]  There's whole books on this.
[01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:38.804]  This is the primary form of terrorism is that people are found, as you say, Patsy's, people who are strange in some way, they're trained.
[01:25:39.204 --> 01:25:47.971]  This was the CIA's operation in Afghanistan with Saudi oil billions and the CIA, which was the largest CIA operation up until that time at least,
[01:25:48.815 --> 01:25:59.679]  Was to find, uh, was to build up this little obscure sect, Al-Qaeda, and to get these kids into these madrasas in Pakistan, and just, Phil, you saw them, they were just, they were just, uh, sort of rich.
[01:25:59.899 --> 01:26:06.001]  Washington Post reported that our government shipped over a million radical hadiths that said, kill Americans.
[01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:09.922]  Our government's shipping them stuff on how to be vicious.
[01:26:12.034 --> 01:26:12.554]  It's incredible.
[01:26:12.574 --> 01:26:13.055]  Stay right there.
[01:26:13.075 --> 01:26:13.735]  We've got a break again.
[01:26:13.755 --> 01:26:14.415]  I want you to come back.
[01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:15.836]  Hit any points you want to get to.
[01:26:15.936 --> 01:26:16.697]  Plug your video.
[01:26:16.757 --> 01:26:17.317]  It's amazing.
[01:26:17.337 --> 01:26:17.717]  Your book.
[01:26:18.177 --> 01:26:19.278]  And then we're going to go to some calls.
[01:26:19.338 --> 01:26:20.799]  Don Illinois and others that are holding.
[01:26:20.819 --> 01:26:22.500]  You want to talk to Barry Schweiker?
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.440]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:23.520]  800-259-9231.
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:24.020]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:24.421]  Infowars.com.
[01:26:24.521 --> 01:26:25.741]  We're on the march.
[01:26:25.781 --> 01:26:26.722]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:26.742 --> 01:26:28.383]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:47.013]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:26:47.233 --> 01:26:52.677]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:55.939]  Ideal for I-840-7091.

[01:26:59.942 --> 01:27:02.784]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:10.722]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:27:11.203 --> 01:27:14.025]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:18.049 --> 01:27:19.391]  Barry Zweikers, our guest.
[01:27:19.991 --> 01:27:23.034]  Headline, Conspiracy Crusader, Doubt's official 9-1-1 version.
[01:27:23.615 --> 01:27:24.976]  Writing a book, done a film.
[01:27:24.996 --> 01:27:29.821]  Exposing this, and he came right out with it, is they didn't have knowledge, folks.
[01:27:29.841 --> 01:27:31.523]  They were complicit inside job.
[01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:39.693]  We've got Dan, Illinois, John, Boston, Warren, Colorado, John, Canada, and others as we blast out on the M&F & Dial.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.262]  DC, Boston, Denver, Austin, all over the place.
[01:27:43.282 --> 01:27:44.183]  The show's exploding.
[01:27:44.223 --> 01:27:45.204]  These people want the truth.
[01:27:45.705 --> 01:27:48.007]  We wake up the right wing and the left wing to the tyranny.
[01:27:48.667 --> 01:27:51.249]  I started out, of course, as what you'd call a mainstream conservative.
[01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:58.776]  I am a pro-liberty individual, and I found out the truth that the entire government is rotten to the core across the political spectrum.
[01:27:58.796 --> 01:28:07.664]  We've got to realize the horror to change that, and we're about to go to your calls, but I've been jumping all over our guests because he's got so many insights, and we're on the same page.
[01:28:08.684 --> 01:28:11.785]  Barry, any other key points you want to hit on before we go to these callers?
[01:28:12.125 --> 01:28:20.648]  Well, look, I'd just like to really, really enter a vote of confidence for what you just said about yourself, about right-wing and left-wing.
[01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:23.349]  Earlier I used the term right-wing and left-wing.
[01:28:24.291 --> 01:28:35.495]  I don't take it back, but also I believe it's even larger that the right wing and the left wing, we go beyond left and right in this, because liberty is something that everybody should want.
[01:28:35.535 --> 01:28:39.457]  Well, it's the military-industrial complex, and they'll use any party at any time.
[01:28:39.657 --> 01:28:47.560]  That's right, and one thing I like to see, actually there was some terrorism legislation introduced back in the Clinton era, and even earlier in the Reagan era, which didn't
[01:28:50.261 --> 01:28:54.122]  Well, it didn't pass, it was Patriot Act stuff, but it didn't get quite squeezed through.
[01:28:54.142 --> 01:28:58.804]  There was the infamous alleged Libyan hit squads who was trying to frighten the public into that.
[01:28:59.184 --> 01:29:08.006]  And the reason that legislation didn't go through was because of this beautiful, unlikely pairing of the ACLU and the NRA.
[01:29:08.106 --> 01:29:09.147]  I loved it, you know?
[01:29:09.267 --> 01:29:12.127]  Both sides came in and said, this is bad legislation.
[01:29:12.388 --> 01:29:13.728]  So I want to back up any bit.
[01:29:13.868 --> 01:29:16.989]  The second thing I want to say before we take these calls, if I may,
[01:29:17.749 --> 01:29:23.671]  I was talking about the nature of belief and saying that denial is the surface and what's underneath denial is fears.
[01:29:24.131 --> 01:29:25.992]  And I think it's really, really important.
[01:29:26.032 --> 01:29:31.714]  This has changed my life and heart a little bit, my coming to understand more about this as this book writes me.
[01:29:32.894 --> 01:29:35.476]  Is that people have legitimate fears, Alex.
[01:29:35.596 --> 01:29:36.617]  They have legitimate fears.
[01:29:36.957 --> 01:29:51.549]  When they're confronted with such an incredible, dark suggestions that maybe their top leaders would not only lie to them, they would kill their own citizens for private gain and for all sorts of shadowy purposes that have to do with bloated militarism and everything.
[01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:56.673]  And so if people speak up about that, they will have what I say are legitimate fears.
[01:29:56.713 --> 01:29:59.115]  They may fear that people will shun or avoid them if they
[01:29:59.658 --> 01:30:03.209]  If they speak up and they'll be called non-patriotic?
[01:30:03.994 --> 01:30:08.516]  Maybe they'll face peer group pressure, which is a very powerful thing to be laughed at.
[01:30:08.596 --> 01:30:10.097]  Maybe they won't get a promotion.
[01:30:10.137 --> 01:30:11.998]  Maybe their very job might be in danger.
[01:30:12.358 --> 01:30:13.818]  And these fears are legitimate.
[01:30:13.858 --> 01:30:15.819]  And I have sympathy for people who have those fears.
[01:30:15.979 --> 01:30:16.460]  I'm lucky.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:17.520]  I'm independent.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.501]  Since 1970, I've been self-employed.
[01:30:19.761 --> 01:30:20.661]  Nobody could fire me.
[01:30:20.962 --> 01:30:22.382]  Well, that's luxury.
[01:30:22.562 --> 01:30:23.903]  A lot of people can be fired.
[01:30:24.243 --> 01:30:26.744]  A lot of people's neighbors will shun and avoid them.
[01:30:26.964 --> 01:30:28.305]  And I've got a lot of sympathy.
[01:30:28.325 --> 01:30:33.507]  But at the same time, I don't have so much sympathy that I let people off the hook that they've got to do some homework.
[01:30:33.707 --> 01:30:35.109]  They're totally enslaving us.
[01:30:35.129 --> 01:30:36.510]  They're going to go after everybody.
[01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:38.993]  We must fight this, even in the short term it's coming down.
[01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:39.894]  And let me say something.
[01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:41.235]  This is an illusion.
[01:30:41.255 --> 01:30:45.159]  When they attack the Dixie Chicks and all that, that is to create a chilling effect.
[01:30:45.199 --> 01:30:48.002]  That is to destroy the First Amendment, what America is about.
[01:30:48.022 --> 01:30:49.484]  And I've got to tell you something, Barry.
[01:30:49.924 --> 01:30:53.148]  I've done, this is why I say this every week, it's an incredible testament.
[01:30:54.247 --> 01:31:10.012]  I've done over 800 radio interviews since 9-1-1, and because I'm bold, I don't apologize, I'm not afraid, that spirit telegraphs, and I've had a hundred callers, maybe a hundred that disagree, thousands and thousands and thousands that agree.
[01:31:10.313 --> 01:31:14.214]  I'll be on some show that covers 35 states, a conservative show, a liberal show.
[01:31:15.596 --> 01:31:18.497]  One caller out of thirty might call and disagree.
[01:31:18.517 --> 01:31:20.018]  They're an incoherent idiot.
[01:31:20.338 --> 01:31:22.659]  They'll generally say I should be arrested for what I'm saying.
[01:31:23.259 --> 01:31:24.899]  So, we are the majority.
[01:31:25.019 --> 01:31:29.721]  I don't believe their illusion, and that's why we're able to do this and say this, because there's so many of us.
[01:31:29.741 --> 01:31:32.642]  If it was one or two of us doing this, we'd die in car wrecks real quick.
[01:31:32.822 --> 01:31:35.083]  There's so many of us now telling the truth.
[01:31:35.263 --> 01:31:43.786]  I couldn't agree more, and you know, when I did my original series of commentaries about this back in January of last year,
[01:31:45.206 --> 01:31:52.028]  Some people at our TV channel, my senior producer said she felt sick to her stomach the first morning she came in.
[01:31:52.068 --> 01:31:54.889]  She was sure that there was going to be all these horrible emails and everything.
[01:31:54.929 --> 01:32:00.010]  And she opened up her emails and the first one said, congratulations, you guys have got courage, terrific.
[01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:03.451]  And she said, well, we've got at least one good email.
[01:32:03.671 --> 01:32:04.871]  And then the second one was the same.
[01:32:04.891 --> 01:32:06.592]  I had over a thousand emails.
[01:32:06.812 --> 01:32:07.712]  And you know what?
[01:32:07.752 --> 01:32:10.773]  The antagonistic ones, I could count on the fingers of two hands.
[01:32:11.093 --> 01:32:17.555]  I've had the same experience you do, and that's the experience Michelle Landsberg had with her column of last Sunday.
[01:32:17.615 --> 01:32:26.458]  Barry, people that don't agree with us, that don't have an internal understanding, a historical understanding, don't know how to send emails.
[01:32:27.168 --> 01:32:27.508]  Okay.
[01:32:28.148 --> 01:32:31.509]  I mean, anybody who loves their children will instinctively know what's happening.
[01:32:31.529 --> 01:32:33.409]  Then you look at the rational evidence.
[01:32:33.549 --> 01:32:35.110]  It is disgusting.
[01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:44.711]  It's like learning your neighbor you thought was nice was a serial killer, and as they remove the dead, desiccated bodies out of the backyard, you go, you vomit, but at least you know the truth.
[01:32:44.871 --> 01:32:45.031]  Yep.
[01:32:45.432 --> 01:32:46.332]  Now, let's take calls.
[01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:47.812]  Let's talk to Don in Illinois.
[01:32:48.092 --> 01:32:49.312]  Don, you're on the air with our guests.
[01:32:49.352 --> 01:32:49.732]  Go ahead.
[01:32:51.393 --> 01:32:51.973]  Welcome, Don.
[01:32:51.993 --> 01:32:52.553]  You're on the air.
[01:32:53.903 --> 01:32:54.464]  Or Dan.
[01:32:54.684 --> 01:32:55.524]  Just go ahead, caller.
[01:32:55.564 --> 01:32:56.185]  You're on the air.
[01:32:56.365 --> 01:32:56.645]  Okay.
[01:32:57.486 --> 01:32:58.046]  You're on the air.
[01:32:58.086 --> 01:32:58.426]  Go ahead.
[01:32:58.526 --> 01:32:58.827]  Hello.
[01:32:59.207 --> 01:32:59.807]  Yes, hello.
[01:32:59.887 --> 01:33:00.288]  Hi, Dan.
[01:33:01.028 --> 01:33:02.309]  Bruce, you were talking about denial.
[01:33:03.150 --> 01:33:15.258]  And you're hitting it right in the head, because isn't it the degree of denial that somebody's own life, whether they're dealing with their own problems or not, like bad marriage, bad job, and they're just staying in it.
[01:33:15.278 --> 01:33:17.480]  And in order to do that, they have to be in denial.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:20.042]  We're denying naphtha and gas, destroying our economy.
[01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:28.735]  Right, I mean the economy going down, all these particular things in order to survive, you have to shut down and not pay attention to all the details.
[01:33:29.715 --> 01:33:40.383]  When that happens, you can't perceive the other parts of the world being so terrible either because if you can't perceive it in your own life, you're not going to be able to perceive it at a higher level.
[01:33:41.388 --> 01:33:43.010]  I agree with you, Dan.
[01:33:43.230 --> 01:33:45.052]  I think you're right.
[01:33:45.672 --> 01:33:47.875]  But, you know, we don't have to go into denial.
[01:33:47.915 --> 01:33:49.156]  I don't think you meant we have to.
[01:33:49.696 --> 01:33:51.218]  The thing is that denial does work.
[01:33:51.798 --> 01:33:56.083]  There are things that have happened in our family that are very painful to think about.
[01:33:56.723 --> 01:33:58.424]  And you don't want to think about them every day.
[01:33:59.044 --> 01:34:00.705]  So let's call it denial, okay.
[01:34:00.725 --> 01:34:06.748]  But it's sort of a conscious denial where you just say, I'm not going to wallow in the pain of something that happened.
[01:34:06.928 --> 01:34:14.352]  Have you ever been driving along and a bad thought from childhood or something or something embarrassing comes back into your mind and you catch yourself going, ah!
[01:34:14.792 --> 01:34:17.874]  And you're like, wow, that was a subconscious thing that just came out.
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:21.963]  Yeah, and so actually we're wired for denial.
[01:34:21.983 --> 01:34:24.064]  Defense mechanisms, they call them.
[01:34:24.084 --> 01:34:24.945]  Yeah, defense mechanisms.
[01:34:25.566 --> 01:34:26.206]  Which mechanism?
[01:34:26.466 --> 01:34:27.347]  Defense mechanisms.
[01:34:27.367 --> 01:34:28.348]  Yeah, defense mechanism.
[01:34:28.388 --> 01:34:29.909]  That's very, very well said, Dan.
[01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:35.113]  But anyway, the thing is that we have to, it's very important that we not lie to ourselves.
[01:34:35.374 --> 01:34:47.724]  That's the key thing, that's the most... I happen, my hero happens to be a guy named Bertrand Russell, a dead British white philosopher, and he had his own ten commandments, and his first commandment is never lie to yourself.
[01:34:48.627 --> 01:34:51.369]  And I think that is the first and foremost commandment.
[01:34:51.389 --> 01:34:52.290]  Well, don't lie to yourself.
[01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:57.073]  Bertrand Russell, see, you've got this left-wing globalism arm, and that's how they catch us all.
[01:34:57.093 --> 01:35:00.115]  They've got the phony right-wing, they've got the phony left-wing, but that's for another discussion.
[01:35:00.155 --> 01:35:01.957]  But that is another discussion!
[01:35:02.717 --> 01:35:15.366]  One more thing, Perry, I was telling Alex the other day, is that when you're not having the ability to think, and it increases prejudice at the same time, is that you can confuse two different races, or people within the same race.
[01:35:16.109 --> 01:35:18.109]  The Al-Qaeda is a trained soldier.
[01:35:18.349 --> 01:35:20.550]  He's not a suicide bomber like a Palestinian.
[01:35:21.330 --> 01:35:36.233]  And they're trying to pawn off on the public that there's no difference between an Al-Qaeda, James Bond, trained person who's trained to live, not to die, is equivalent to this desperate Palestinian that only has one way of doing things, is blowing himself up.
[01:35:36.973 --> 01:35:37.713]  He doesn't operate that way.
[01:35:37.753 --> 01:35:37.973]  Absolutely.
[01:35:38.153 --> 01:35:39.054]  Dan, thanks for the call.
[01:35:39.134 --> 01:35:40.554]  John in Boston, Mass.
[01:35:40.874 --> 01:35:42.034]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:35:42.054 --> 01:35:42.714]  Go ahead, John.
[01:35:44.915 --> 01:35:45.295]  Hi, John.
[01:35:46.943 --> 01:35:49.524]  John has the radio on.
[01:35:49.604 --> 01:35:50.844]  He's not listening right now.
[01:35:50.864 --> 01:35:52.825]  The callers have kind of been doing this to me lately.
[01:35:53.585 --> 01:35:54.326]  John, are you there?
[01:35:54.346 --> 01:35:57.006]  Okay, put him on hold.
[01:35:57.206 --> 01:35:58.027]  He'll be back later.
[01:35:58.187 --> 01:36:00.468]  Let's hope they're so interested they can't hear themselves.
[01:36:00.508 --> 01:36:01.788]  Well, you can hear the delay.
[01:36:01.848 --> 01:36:02.908]  He sees off, doesn't know.
[01:36:02.928 --> 01:36:03.649]  He'll find out soon.
[01:36:04.009 --> 01:36:07.110]  Warren in Colorado.
[01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:08.910]  Then we'll go to John in Canadaville, Alaska.
[01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:09.891]  Warren, you're on the air.
[01:36:09.931 --> 01:36:10.271]  Welcome.
[01:36:10.751 --> 01:36:11.051]  Hello.
[01:36:11.671 --> 01:36:16.493]  Real quick, I remember on September 11th, that morning, they already
[01:36:17.168 --> 01:36:23.133]  They were showing pictures of the terrorists on TV and I thought that was so strange how they could know that already.
[01:36:23.313 --> 01:36:23.493]  Yup.
[01:36:23.974 --> 01:36:24.474]  So quickly.
[01:36:26.436 --> 01:36:30.379]  Actually I can barely hear you guys but I'll just continue.
[01:36:31.319 --> 01:36:41.167]  I expected a lot more security measures in place other than shutting down the airports and I guess I'm... Well that was just training us to accept the military on the streets.
[01:36:42.268 --> 01:36:45.611]  Yeah I'd like to know your thoughts on, you know, my thoughts were that
[01:36:46.186 --> 01:36:46.926]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:36:46.946 --> 01:36:50.128]  Our borders, north and south, are more open than ever.
[01:37:02.669 --> 01:37:05.911]  They check you more going into Canada than coming out of Canada to the U.S.
[01:37:06.511 --> 01:37:16.337]  This is a key thing for people that is waking them up, Barry, is that our southern border is more open than ever, and they're telling us that the Pentagon's going to have to watch you to keep you safe.
[01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:17.658]  It isn't holding water.
[01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:20.159]  That's one of the big chinks in the propaganda.
[01:37:20.991 --> 01:37:21.692]  It certainly is.
[01:37:21.712 --> 01:37:26.316]  I mean, there's such a horrible track record of crushing civil liberties here.
[01:37:26.716 --> 01:37:34.883]  And that's a great hope that I have for the American public, the man and woman on the street, that somehow they'll connect two dots.
[01:37:35.064 --> 01:37:38.286]  One dot is the proud history of liberty.
[01:37:40.581 --> 01:37:44.003]  And of protecting liberty at any price.
[01:37:44.564 --> 01:37:51.128]  And what's happening with the new Patriot Act 1 and Patriot Act 2, they just don't mix its oil and water.
[01:37:51.168 --> 01:38:02.255]  Well, I mean, Patriot Act 2 is secret arrest for any crime, secret execution, says it in the subsections, and they're saying we've got to take America's rights away to defend America.
[01:38:02.335 --> 01:38:09.220]  America's America because we have this Bill of Rights and Constitution, not because we're a police state with police in black ski masks.
[01:38:10.225 --> 01:38:22.170]  You know, now this is the time for Americans to wake up to ask themselves the question, are they for the kind of liberty that they've been raised on and told about and taught?
[01:38:22.891 --> 01:38:28.133]  Or are they going to accept some cockamamie stories by the current gang?
[01:38:28.951 --> 01:38:33.494]  That obviously is interested in crushing these liberties.
[01:38:33.794 --> 01:38:40.919]  I mean, I'm just boggled how Americans have allowed themselves to let this happen.
[01:38:40.979 --> 01:38:49.345]  Well, our news media just dribbles it out and then makes the petty stories big, but I was at the cleaners a few months ago and a state police major was already in there getting his clothes.
[01:38:49.905 --> 01:38:50.765]  And he was an older guy.
[01:38:50.805 --> 01:38:54.366]  He said, Alex, we were brought up that what's happening in America is what happened in Soviet Union.
[01:38:54.806 --> 01:38:55.726]  We know this is wrong.
[01:38:55.746 --> 01:38:56.686]  And I said, how many of you know it?
[01:38:56.706 --> 01:38:57.867]  And he goes, most of the old guys.
[01:38:58.647 --> 01:38:59.907]  We know what's happening is bad.
[01:38:59.947 --> 01:39:02.367]  We know 9-1-1 couldn't be pulled off by those people.
[01:39:03.028 --> 01:39:05.288]  And the guy almost had tears in his eyes.
[01:39:05.928 --> 01:39:07.448]  So people are waking up.
[01:39:07.829 --> 01:39:09.769]  He's got to get more than tears in his eyes, you know.
[01:39:09.809 --> 01:39:10.609]  He's got to speak up.
[01:39:11.029 --> 01:39:15.050]  He's got to go that extra step to become an active citizen.
[01:39:15.874 --> 01:39:16.474]  Absolutely.
[01:39:16.514 --> 01:39:18.035]  Let's talk to John in Boston.
[01:39:18.075 --> 01:39:18.535]  He's there.
[01:39:18.555 --> 01:39:21.856]  Then we'll go to John in Canada and Bill in Alaska and others.
[01:39:21.896 --> 01:39:23.116]  Go ahead, John in Boston.
[01:39:23.156 --> 01:39:23.557]  You're on.
[01:39:24.117 --> 01:39:25.057]  Yeah, sorry about that.
[01:39:25.097 --> 01:39:26.217]  I was listening on the internet.
[01:39:26.277 --> 01:39:26.998]  That's okay, sir.
[01:39:27.018 --> 01:39:27.398]  Go ahead.
[01:39:27.418 --> 01:39:29.839]  I didn't realize it was delayed.
[01:39:30.119 --> 01:39:31.439]  I'm a first-time caller, by the way.
[01:39:32.019 --> 01:39:33.980]  I've been listening to you since, like, right after 9-11.
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:35.520]  I love the show.
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:36.061]  Great show.
[01:39:36.101 --> 01:39:36.641]  Great guest.
[01:39:38.541 --> 01:39:40.862]  I just wanted to, Alex, I wanted to bring your attention.
[01:39:41.242 --> 01:39:43.243]  In today's Boston Herald on page 4,
[01:39:44.482 --> 01:39:49.436]  There's a piece about John carrying his skull and bones connection.
[01:39:50.106 --> 01:40:01.829]  Yeah, we're going to have two Skull and Bones guys running against each other in a secret, blue-blood society, a racist society, where they admittedly have Nazi flags.
[01:40:01.889 --> 01:40:03.009]  That's MSNBC.
[01:40:03.289 --> 01:40:04.509]  Any comments to that, Barry?
[01:40:05.050 --> 01:40:11.591]  Well, you know, I only heard about the Skull and Bones Society about a year ago, and we all have the limits to our belief.
[01:40:11.711 --> 01:40:12.691]  We all have boundaries.
[01:40:12.811 --> 01:40:14.932]  I'm not immune from that either.
[01:40:15.212 --> 01:40:18.793]  I believe the story about Flight 800, that it was mechanical failure.
[01:40:19.993 --> 01:40:24.194]  I can be fooled, too, and I thought, skull and bones, that sounds too rich, you know?
[01:40:24.274 --> 01:40:26.835]  I don't... I gotta learn more about this.
[01:40:26.855 --> 01:40:32.997]  Well, the friend of mine who told me about this, he gave me information about it, and my gosh, I found out that it's actually true!
[01:40:33.377 --> 01:40:37.838]  Oh, USA Today says, oh, they do some satanic rituals, that's what's the big deal.
[01:40:38.178 --> 01:40:38.278]  Yep.
[01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:46.280]  I mean, that's what I mean, this is so bizarro, off the scale, how do you even... again, it's the denial, it's like they're trying to shock us.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:46.720]  Yep.
[01:40:47.768 --> 01:40:53.495]  Yes, and there can be the big lie technique invoked in these things.
[01:40:55.218 --> 01:40:59.743]  Hitler's propaganda minister was a specialist in this.
[01:40:59.803 --> 01:41:02.166]  The bigger the lie you tell, the more likely people will believe it.
[01:41:02.187 --> 01:41:04.009]  And the reason for that is most people are decent.
[01:41:06.271 --> 01:41:09.193]  Most of the time in their own lives are, in fact, honest.
[01:41:09.233 --> 01:41:10.213]  Well, we have conscience.
[01:41:10.293 --> 01:41:12.634]  I mean, if I say something rude to my wife, I feel bad about it.
[01:41:12.894 --> 01:41:14.615]  These people don't have conscience.
[01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:19.037]  You know, this friend of mine who told me about the Skull and Bones Society, he's a psychotherapist.
[01:41:19.077 --> 01:41:21.038]  He's a family therapist here in Toronto.
[01:41:21.458 --> 01:41:23.259]  And he told me, he said something very interesting.
[01:41:23.519 --> 01:41:28.401]  He said the higher you go in any organization, the more likely you are to encounter a psychopath.
[01:41:29.506 --> 01:41:32.570]  Because the people at the top have had to step on so many people's necks.
[01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:34.291]  They've had to tell so many lies.
[01:41:34.351 --> 01:41:40.638]  They've had to be so single-minded in their devotion to getting power and control that they lose their humanity.
[01:41:40.658 --> 01:41:44.662]  Well, I say it, scum rises to the top because you've got to be totally ruthless.
[01:41:45.343 --> 01:41:46.564]  And it's a synthesis of evil.
[01:41:46.624 --> 01:41:47.405]  Thank you, John.
[01:41:47.525 --> 01:41:49.948]  What did the Boston article say, sir?
[01:41:50.985 --> 01:41:56.589]  Um, yeah, the title of it was Kerry Made His Bones in Secret Club Like Bush, by Andrew Meagher.
[01:41:56.970 --> 01:41:59.772]  And of course, making your bones is an allusion to... Right.
[01:42:00.452 --> 01:42:03.374]  Um, I'll give you the first couple paragraphs of short.
[01:42:03.775 --> 01:42:16.944]  Um, Washington, Senator John F. Kerry expounds on many issues in his presidential campaign, but he's completely silent on one topic, his membership in the Skull and Bones, Yale's infamous secret society.
[01:42:17.585 --> 01:42:20.307]  John Kerry has absolutely nothing to say on that subject.
[01:42:20.868 --> 01:42:23.731]  Sorry, said Carrie's spokeswoman, Kelly Bonanda.
[01:42:23.891 --> 01:42:25.132]  Alright, thanks for the call, John.
[01:42:25.312 --> 01:42:26.353]  Very valuable, John.
[01:42:26.493 --> 01:42:27.134]  Very valuable.
[01:42:27.254 --> 01:42:29.896]  Email that to tips at infowars.com.
[01:42:29.996 --> 01:42:33.400]  John in Canada, you're on the air with your fellow Canadian.
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:33.780]  Go ahead.
[01:42:35.962 --> 01:42:37.403]  John in Canada, go ahead.
[01:42:37.423 --> 01:42:38.704]  Hello?
[01:42:39.025 --> 01:42:39.785]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:42:40.066 --> 01:42:41.287]  Yes, how are you today, gentlemen?
[01:42:41.507 --> 01:42:41.867]  Fine.
[01:42:42.248 --> 01:42:42.488]  Good.
[01:42:42.968 --> 01:42:45.691]  I'd like to, I guess your reception's bad, but anyway, we'll get through this.
[01:42:46.341 --> 01:42:48.244]  Um, I don't know whether Barry's familiar with the new bill.
[01:42:48.264 --> 01:42:48.764]  Let me just stop you.
[01:42:48.825 --> 01:42:50.347]  Can we boost the audio of the callers?
[01:42:50.367 --> 01:42:50.727]  Go ahead.
[01:42:51.488 --> 01:42:51.748]  Hello?
[01:42:52.349 --> 01:42:53.691]  Yeah, we'll try to boost your audio.
[01:42:53.711 --> 01:42:54.111]  Go ahead.
[01:42:54.592 --> 01:42:56.955]  The, um, I don't know whether Barry's familiar with the new bill.
[01:42:57.035 --> 01:43:04.425]  It's just going through the Parliament now, which is tailored after the Homeland Security bill, which is Bill C-17, which takes away the citizens' rights of Canada.
[01:43:05.026 --> 01:43:05.606]  Well, I am.
[01:43:05.947 --> 01:43:08.848]  And not only that, we've had a total of three of those bills.
[01:43:09.329 --> 01:43:17.673]  And you probably know Gelati, the famous lawyer, Rocco Gelati, and he pointed out a very interesting thing.
[01:43:17.733 --> 01:43:19.054]  He got those bills very early.
[01:43:19.074 --> 01:43:19.975]  There was C-36 and C-42, now there's C-17.
[01:43:22.416 --> 01:43:29.185]  And he got those bills, he put them together, he read all through them, and he found out that individually the bills are bad enough, yeah.
[01:43:29.365 --> 01:43:37.877]  But when you put them together, you put the definition of terrorism here, in another bill you put what the police can do, in another bill it's what the corrections officer can do.
[01:43:38.097 --> 01:43:43.062]  It's an integration and interface just like Patriot Act 1 and 2 with Homeland Security.
[01:43:43.442 --> 01:43:44.803]  Maximum dictatorship.
[01:43:44.843 --> 01:43:45.404]  Exactly.
[01:43:45.444 --> 01:43:46.805]  When you put them together.
[01:43:47.266 --> 01:43:52.591]  And not only that, but our bills in Canada were suspiciously fast coming forward.
[01:43:52.611 --> 01:43:54.813]  They really couldn't have been written just after 9-11.
[01:43:54.853 --> 01:43:55.894]  They were in readiness.
[01:43:55.934 --> 01:43:58.016]  Somebody was writing this stuff earlier.
[01:43:58.536 --> 01:44:00.337]  Because they were down in Washington, I'm sure of that.
[01:44:00.578 --> 01:44:02.279]  Well, I'm afraid that could be.
[01:44:02.339 --> 01:44:05.201]  There's a lot too much integration, I would say.
[01:44:05.241 --> 01:44:07.603]  We're going to have serious problems here.
[01:44:07.723 --> 01:44:14.188]  If Paul Martin becomes Prime Minister of this country, who's already controlling this country, we're going to have serious problems like we're going to have with Bush the same way.
[01:44:14.308 --> 01:44:15.569]  Well, sir, it's already on the map.
[01:44:15.589 --> 01:44:18.631]  You're not going to have Canadian sovereignty within five years if this continues.
[01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:23.392]  Well, there's a lot of people up here that will turn around and take their guns out regardless of what the government says here.
[01:44:23.673 --> 01:44:25.033]  Because there are a lot of guns out here.
[01:44:25.334 --> 01:44:27.275]  And it's not only Paul Martin, John.
[01:44:27.355 --> 01:44:28.515]  It's also John Manley.
[01:44:29.436 --> 01:44:31.157]  You know, they're cut from the same cloth.
[01:44:31.858 --> 01:44:35.681]  And I think they're out of tune, really, with most Canadians.
[01:44:35.741 --> 01:44:38.504]  Most Canadians are very favorable and friendly to the USA.
[01:44:38.544 --> 01:44:39.745]  We have a lot of American friends.
[01:44:39.765 --> 01:44:40.846]  We travel to the States.
[01:44:40.926 --> 01:44:41.606]  I love the place.
[01:44:42.407 --> 01:44:50.534]  But the thing is, the governments get together and they pull off... Oh yeah, when I say America's taking over, I mean the dictatorship is going to take over your stuff.
[01:44:50.874 --> 01:44:51.214]  Exactly.
[01:44:51.434 --> 01:44:52.455]  One more segment with our guest.
[01:44:52.475 --> 01:44:55.157]  We'll talk to Bill in Alaska and tell you about his book and his film.
[01:44:55.677 --> 01:44:59.780]  Final segment with our guest in the third hour is the economy, the second amendment, everything.
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:00.461]  It's all coming up.
[01:45:00.541 --> 01:45:01.402]  Final segment with our guest.
[01:45:01.422 --> 01:45:01.762]  Stay with me.
[01:45:04.773 --> 01:45:12.160]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:45:12.421 --> 01:45:17.185]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:45:17.385 --> 01:45:23.051]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:45:23.271 --> 01:45:27.795]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:45:28.035 --> 01:45:35.180]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:38.623]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[01:45:38.803 --> 01:45:39.724]  And much, much more.
[01:45:39.904 --> 01:45:42.426]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:45:42.646 --> 01:45:49.391]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:46:07.217 --> 01:46:10.718]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[01:46:14.979 --> 01:46:21.140]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:29.442]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:46:29.882 --> 01:46:35.226]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[01:46:35.366 --> 01:46:39.129]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:46:39.509 --> 01:46:41.371]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.

[01:48:15.724 --> 01:48:18.744]  If you're not excited, if you're not upset, something's wrong with you.
[01:48:18.764 --> 01:48:24.086]  And I think that Barry, our guest, has really hit the nail on the head that it is about denial.
[01:48:24.941 --> 01:48:26.642]  It is about the fear deep inside.
[01:48:26.682 --> 01:48:29.505]  You better get over that fear and face the threat.
[01:48:29.945 --> 01:48:31.186]  It will not make it go away.
[01:48:31.226 --> 01:48:33.368]  There are monsters in the closet in the real world.
[01:48:33.728 --> 01:48:35.329]  And hiding under the cover isn't going to save you.
[01:48:36.250 --> 01:48:37.791]  I've produced nine films.
[01:48:37.892 --> 01:48:39.113]  The ninth is now out.
[01:48:39.173 --> 01:48:41.114]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:48:41.795 --> 01:48:43.256]  You want to know what they're going to set up in this country?
[01:48:43.276 --> 01:48:44.237]  What they're already setting up?
[01:48:44.277 --> 01:48:45.097]  You need to get the film.
[01:48:45.598 --> 01:48:47.559]  Go to Infowars.com or Net.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:49.921]  Get Road to Tyranny, about 9-1-1.
[01:48:49.961 --> 01:48:51.563]  Part 2 of that, Masters of Terror.

[01:48:54.657 --> 01:48:58.238]  Go to Infowars.com or net or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:48:58.258 --> 01:49:00.119]  That's 1-888-253-3139 or Infowars.com or net.
[01:49:00.139 --> 01:49:04.180]  Just get the films, get the word out to everyone now.
[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:08.862]  It's got to be done now, not tomorrow, not next week, not next year.
[01:49:08.962 --> 01:49:11.023]  Infowars.com or net.
[01:49:23.687 --> 01:49:28.229]  PresentPlanet.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:29.770]  Police State 3 is now out.
[01:49:31.351 --> 01:49:34.633]  Barry, how do folks get your film, The Great Deception?
[01:49:36.233 --> 01:49:44.417]  It's pretty bad because my phone, I've had to hire a special assistant just to answer my phone, but I'll give you the area code is 416.
[01:49:46.639 --> 01:49:47.379]  And the number is 651
[01:49:50.203 --> 01:49:51.946]  Double-five, double-eight.
[01:49:52.226 --> 01:49:54.709]  Six-five-one, five-five, eight-eight.
[01:49:55.170 --> 01:49:57.954]  There's an outgoing message, tells you everything you need to know.
[01:49:58.955 --> 01:50:01.859]  We're having an incredible... It looks like we're moving toward 500 sales.
[01:50:06.945 --> 01:50:10.166]  We have an equation here in Canada, it's called the 10% thing.
[01:50:10.567 --> 01:50:14.128]  Because the population of Canada is about one-tenth of the population of USA.
[01:50:14.508 --> 01:50:17.769]  So whatever happens to the states, we usually divide it by 10 and figure that's normal.
[01:50:17.789 --> 01:50:26.833]  Okay, for those who don't know, you're a national television host, you did this on your own, and you write for newspapers, and you just put together this video, and believe me, it'll be a lot more than 500 of you get the word out, but 416-651-5588.
[01:50:27.133 --> 01:50:27.373]  That's it.
[01:50:27.413 --> 01:50:28.273]  Now let's take a quick call.
[01:50:28.293 --> 01:50:29.834]  Leave three weeks for the delivery.
[01:50:36.396 --> 01:50:38.897]  Oh yeah, let me tell you, trying to get stuff into Canada is what's hard.
[01:50:39.618 --> 01:50:42.139]  Let's talk to Bill in Alaska.
[01:50:42.179 --> 01:50:43.239]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:50:43.259 --> 01:50:43.680]  Go ahead.
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.040]  Yes sir, Alex.
[01:50:46.621 --> 01:50:47.581]  I just had to call in.
[01:50:47.621 --> 01:50:53.864]  I got an enemy that hasn't been mentioned yet on today's show.
[01:50:54.625 --> 01:50:58.166]  And the American people want to know why this is like this.
[01:50:59.187 --> 01:51:00.527]  All we got to do is look in the mirror.
[01:51:02.048 --> 01:51:03.769]  Jim Jones in Case in Point.
[01:51:04.770 --> 01:51:08.252]  I don't believe he was as guilty as the people that followed him.
[01:51:10.212 --> 01:51:15.134]  Because he couldn't have been a bad leader if he hadn't had followers.
[01:51:16.095 --> 01:51:20.597]  There's people that think like George Bush in the homeless shelter up here, but they're no threat to me.
[01:51:21.117 --> 01:51:22.157]  They're not influential.
[01:51:22.177 --> 01:51:23.938]  They haven't been leveraged into position.
[01:51:25.079 --> 01:51:28.320]  In fact, everybody that follows the wrong way is an enemy.
[01:51:30.754 --> 01:51:33.775]  That's why raising cattle is profitable.
[01:51:34.356 --> 01:51:39.678]  The herd is predictable and they can be moved at a profit to the ultimate destination.
[01:51:41.639 --> 01:51:43.140]  And that's pretty much all I had to say.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:46.441]  Alright, thank you for the call from Alaska.
[01:51:46.601 --> 01:51:47.942]  Pretty powerful statement Bill.
[01:51:49.723 --> 01:51:51.084]  Well, absolutely it is.
[01:51:51.164 --> 01:51:51.804]  One more call.
[01:51:51.844 --> 01:51:53.625]  Let's talk to Brian.
[01:51:53.685 --> 01:51:54.585]  Brian, you're on the air.
[01:51:54.625 --> 01:51:55.326]  Where are you calling from?
[01:51:55.746 --> 01:51:57.126]  Hey Alex, I'm calling from Denver.
[01:51:57.426 --> 01:51:58.287]  Okay, welcome sir.
[01:51:59.235 --> 01:52:04.680]  First of all, I want to tell you I appreciate that you guys don't censor your calls like a lot of other radio stations.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:07.343]  No, no, we don't have to do that here because we tell the truth.
[01:52:07.963 --> 01:52:08.484]  That's correct.
[01:52:08.564 --> 01:52:09.645]  We break conditioning.
[01:52:10.586 --> 01:52:19.614]  I was wondering if you had heard anything about the Bohemian Grove donating $20 million to CU and what your thought was on that.
[01:52:20.335 --> 01:52:21.436]  What, to your university?
[01:52:21.856 --> 01:52:22.056]  Yeah.
[01:52:22.476 --> 01:52:23.477]  No, I don't know anything about it.
[01:52:23.517 --> 01:52:25.039]  Of course, I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[01:52:26.058 --> 01:52:28.038]  Well, it was on the radio last night.
[01:52:28.919 --> 01:52:30.779]  Or, I'm sorry, not the radio, the news.
[01:52:31.139 --> 01:52:31.679]  Hey, I'll tell you what.
[01:52:31.699 --> 01:52:32.299]  Hold on a second.
[01:52:32.799 --> 01:52:33.860]  Barry, do you have to go?
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:35.180]  I don't have to go.
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:35.760]  No, I do not.
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:37.380]  Why don't you stay another 20 minutes?
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:38.500]  Oh, thank you.
[01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:39.661]  I'd be happy to.
[01:52:40.021 --> 01:52:42.641]  I love your callers, and there's things to still talk about.
[01:52:42.721 --> 01:52:42.861]  Okay.
[01:52:42.901 --> 01:52:43.781]  Brian, stay there.
[01:52:43.821 --> 01:52:48.142]  We'll talk about the Skull & Bones Big Boy group that I made a film about.
[01:52:48.162 --> 01:52:50.243]  And we'll talk to Ken and everybody else.
[01:52:50.303 --> 01:52:51.043]  Everybody stay with me.
[01:52:51.063 --> 01:52:51.603]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:54.088 --> 01:52:57.111]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:52:57.432 --> 01:53:02.377]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:53:02.617 --> 01:53:05.160]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they have been hit.
[01:53:08.884 --> 01:53:12.067]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:20.470]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.151 --> 01:53:22.211]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.912 --> 01:53:24.032]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.673 --> 01:53:25.493]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.234 --> 01:53:27.154]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.174 --> 01:53:31.477]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.997 --> 01:53:36.119]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:40.602]  We're talking to Barry Zwicker.
[01:53:41.562 --> 01:53:47.846]  He is a national media TV critic, written for, I don't know, 40 years, 30, 40 years in the newspapers.
[01:53:49.876 --> 01:53:51.399]  And, uh, been doing a great job.
[01:53:52.281 --> 01:53:59.794]  We appreciate him coming on the show today to talk about 9-1-1, prior knowledge, and as he said, involvement in the attacks that set up a worldwide police state.
[01:54:00.569 --> 01:54:06.232]  I mean, it's German ministers, it's former military people, it's David Shippers, and we're not the only ones.
[01:54:06.252 --> 01:54:12.474]  There's more and more people saying, at the bare minimum, there was total prior knowledge and they allowed it to happen, but the evidence shows they funded it and carried it out.
[01:54:12.495 --> 01:54:14.255]  It's a lot bigger than George Bush or Bill Clinton.
[01:54:14.615 --> 01:54:23.119]  It's that group above them, and they count on you being done, they count on you retreating into the box, and we're going to be taking calls for another 20 minutes with our guest.
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:24.700]  You want to join us on air?
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:26.241]  We've gotten calls from Alaska to
[01:54:27.227 --> 01:54:27.527]  Boston, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:27.607 --> 01:54:32.211]  Brian in Colorado listening to us on one of the fine AMs there in Denver mentioned
[01:54:41.067 --> 01:54:51.272]  Bohemian Grove, that's where the big boys, when they're old men, the Skull and Bones people go to a place called Bohemian Grove, and I snuck in, it was on national television on the Trio Network, and they're doing their satanic rituals right there.
[01:54:51.292 --> 01:54:58.776]  I mean, I know this sounds crazy, but it was on TV, they admit it is a ritual, they admit I got the video, they just say, oh, well, my interpretation is different than theirs.
[01:54:59.176 --> 01:55:08.200]  This shows how looney tunes they are, these world leaders that go there, and you were saying that Bohemian Grove gave $20 million to what university, Brian?
[01:55:08.501 --> 01:55:09.001]  The CU.
[01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:12.211]  And what news channel do you see that on?
[01:55:12.451 --> 01:55:13.771]  On Channel 7 and Channel 9.
[01:55:14.031 --> 01:55:18.452]  It was on last night on their... And what did they say?
[01:55:18.492 --> 01:55:19.313]  The Bohemian Grove?
[01:55:19.333 --> 01:55:20.853]  What did they say the Bohemian Grove was?
[01:55:22.173 --> 01:55:23.754]  They said it was just a Bohemian Grove.
[01:55:24.634 --> 01:55:28.335]  I'm assuming it's the same Bohemian Grove you've been talking about.
[01:55:28.675 --> 01:55:29.696]  Well, I got a video about it.
[01:55:29.716 --> 01:55:30.376]  Right.
[01:55:31.907 --> 01:55:33.868]  Barry, have you ever heard of Bohemian Grove?
[01:55:34.128 --> 01:55:35.849]  I've certainly heard of Bohemian Grove.
[01:55:35.909 --> 01:55:37.870]  I heard about it maybe ten years ago.
[01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:43.593]  My understanding was, and I'm probably out of date on this, my understanding was that it's a private club.
[01:55:44.513 --> 01:55:46.394]  You probably couldn't get back in now.
[01:55:46.454 --> 01:55:48.776]  I think they've tightened the security a lot.
[01:55:48.856 --> 01:55:57.100]  But it's a club where, once a year especially, these top leaders go, sort of members of the Trilateral Commission, the Bejinskis and so on.
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:58.761]  And they dress up in red and black robes.
[01:55:58.801 --> 01:55:59.481]  I have them on tape.
[01:56:00.021 --> 01:56:00.541]  There you go.
[01:56:01.082 --> 01:56:02.362]  They like to dress up.
[01:56:02.643 --> 01:56:04.283]  I must say, these people like to dress up.
[01:56:04.344 --> 01:56:07.305]  It's like our own Conrad Black, a multimillionaire from Canada.
[01:56:07.325 --> 01:56:09.566]  He owns the Chicago Sun-Times and so on.
[01:56:09.927 --> 01:56:12.368]  He couldn't wait to be a British Lord.
[01:56:12.628 --> 01:56:14.089]  They call him Lord Crossover.
[01:56:14.109 --> 01:56:18.951]  He has these great robes and he also likes to dress up like Napoleon.
[01:56:18.991 --> 01:56:25.275]  He's a very great student of Napoleonic military strategy, which actually he's used quite well in his business dealings.
[01:56:25.715 --> 01:56:35.665]  But there's something about these people, they just crave power, they crave pomp, they crave circumstance, they crave influence, they crave great wealth and riches, and that's what they go after.
[01:56:36.606 --> 01:56:39.209]  Well let's say it, they are ultra-control freaks.
[01:56:39.469 --> 01:56:40.070]  They really are.
[01:56:40.610 --> 01:56:42.572]  Vicious, ferret-like creatures.
[01:56:43.053 --> 01:56:43.193]  Yep.
[01:56:44.105 --> 01:56:49.651]  And you know, you were mentioning earlier about we've got to do our homework, we've got to pay attention.
[01:56:49.671 --> 01:56:51.673]  I like what Miles Davis said.
[01:56:52.774 --> 01:56:56.938]  Miles Davis said, if you ain't apprehensive, you ain't paying attention.
[01:56:57.338 --> 01:56:58.580]  Yeah, I've seen that bumper sticker.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:56:59.020]  Isn't that great?
[01:56:59.821 --> 01:57:00.281]  Absolutely.
[01:57:00.341 --> 01:57:01.162]  Anything else, Brian?
[01:57:01.503 --> 01:57:05.486]  Well, I was just wondering what you think their motivation behind $20 million to a college.
[01:57:07.429 --> 01:57:08.550]  Well, it's about control.
[01:57:08.910 --> 01:57:13.372]  Also, we know Skull and Bones does not just have chapters in Yale.
[01:57:13.492 --> 01:57:17.094]  They have covert chapters in at least ten universities we have identified.
[01:57:18.294 --> 01:57:21.176]  UT has one, and this is how they control things.
[01:57:22.643 --> 01:57:25.664]  Can I just jump in there and agree with Alex?
[01:57:25.684 --> 01:57:39.146]  Because, you know, there's a widespread belief, and I only wish it was true, that universities, the academy you might call it, are places where people seek disinterested truth, truth wherever it may lead.
[01:57:39.246 --> 01:57:42.467]  They just do solid scientific research and so on.
[01:57:42.887 --> 01:57:47.928]  Regrettably, a lot of the universities get bought off by these multi-million dollar grants.
[01:57:48.508 --> 01:57:54.474]  And of course, Noam Chomsky is a good guy who's written about how you cannot depend on intellectuals to blow the whistle on tyranny.
[01:57:54.775 --> 01:57:57.457]  It turns out it's ordinary people who blow the whistle on tyranny.
[01:57:57.677 --> 01:57:58.118]  You got it.
[01:57:58.158 --> 01:58:00.220]  We'll be right back with the final segment with our guests.
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:01.221]  Thanks for the call, Brian.
[01:58:01.862 --> 01:58:04.684]  We'll go and we'll talk to John and others.
[01:58:04.724 --> 01:58:06.106]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:06.126 --> 01:58:07.868]  More news coming up as well.
[01:58:07.948 --> 01:58:08.969]  Keep it locked in.
[01:58:15.194 --> 01:58:16.796]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:17.156 --> 01:58:22.901]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:58:23.161 --> 01:58:28.306]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:58:28.626 --> 01:58:37.955]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:58:38.275 --> 01:58:38.936]  It's rechargeable
[01:58:39.056 --> 01:58:43.220]  The 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:58:43.541 --> 01:58:47.545]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:58:47.745 --> 01:58:52.510]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:58:52.890 --> 01:58:58.776]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:58:59.136 --> 01:59:08.168]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:59:09.409 --> 01:59:10.411]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:23.189]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:23.449 --> 01:59:28.194]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:28.414 --> 01:59:34.061]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:34.301 --> 01:59:38.826]  Witness in horror, the execution of the September 11th attacks, and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:59:39.046 --> 01:59:46.193]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:59:46.234 --> 01:59:50.538]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much much more.
[01:59:50.918 --> 01:59:53.419]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:59:53.659 --> 02:00:00.403]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our Constitutional Republic.
[02:00:00.603 --> 02:00:05.865]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:05.885 --> 02:00:06.285]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:00:14.508 --> 02:00:16.969]  I've lost 26 pounds so far with Vim and Vigor.
[02:00:17.269 --> 02:00:23.252]  Since I've been with Vim and Vigor, I've lost 30 pounds, went from a size 42 to a size 38.
[02:00:23.452 --> 02:00:27.394]  People are flabbergasted when they see me and they can't believe it because they've always seen me heavy.
[02:00:27.714 --> 02:00:33.557]  My weight has shrunk at least two or three loops on a belt, and most of my sweatpants and other pants are just been hanging down.
[02:00:33.577 --> 02:00:41.341]  And I've tried a lot for a lot of years, but I have not, and I can honestly say I have not seen weight loss like I have with Vim and Vigor.
[02:00:41.847 --> 02:00:44.089]  I would highly recommend using Vim and Vigor.
[02:00:44.349 --> 02:00:50.874]  Not only has it helped me lose weight, it has helped my blood pressure, helped me sleep better, and have more energy during the day.
[02:00:51.174 --> 02:00:55.518]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:00:55.858 --> 02:00:57.139]  Call right now 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:00:57.179 --> 02:00:57.899]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:00:57.919 --> 02:01:02.163]  And remember, mention you heard it right here, that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[02:01:07.967 --> 02:01:10.749]  Vim and Vigor, call them today, 1-800-622-FIN.
[02:01:10.869 --> 02:01:11.629]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:01:11.649 --> 02:01:21.074]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:23.836 --> 02:01:25.276]  Can you get past the fear?
[02:01:25.316 --> 02:01:27.598]  Can you invoke the truth of what's happened in the world?
[02:01:28.518 --> 02:01:31.720]  Military industrial complex owned by private banks imploding,
[02:01:32.725 --> 02:01:38.551]  A financial system keeping you rallied around the government while they do it by using terror to scare you into submission.
[02:01:38.571 --> 02:01:42.635]  We're talking to a man who's written for the Globe and Mail, Toronto Star.
[02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:45.898]  He's Vision TV's media critic, studies the media.
[02:01:46.979 --> 02:01:50.062]  And he's come out saying the globalists were behind 9-1-1.
[02:01:50.803 --> 02:01:54.146]  And he's Barry Zwicker, Zwicker if you're pronouncing it wrong.
[02:01:55.010 --> 02:01:56.612]  And we're about to go back to the call.
[02:01:56.632 --> 02:02:00.635]  I was told to remember to join us on air on this live Thursday edition of the World Wide Broadcast.
[02:02:01.296 --> 02:02:02.757]  Millions tuning in to the reality.
[02:02:02.777 --> 02:02:03.477]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:07.161 --> 02:02:10.163]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Elias in Michigan.
[02:02:10.263 --> 02:02:11.444]  Go ahead, sir, on the air.
[02:02:11.464 --> 02:02:12.425]  Hello, yeah.
[02:02:12.445 --> 02:02:19.671]  I wanted to say to your guest that I have a book and it's written by Conrad Heiden.
[02:02:19.872 --> 02:02:20.772]  I don't know if you've heard of him.
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:25.383]  It's titled is, Der Fuhrer, Hitler's Rise to Power.
[02:02:25.944 --> 02:02:39.636]  I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in that kind of a thing, because evidently Conrad Haydn knew Hitler, not personally, but he was there, and he saw it all.
[02:02:40.136 --> 02:02:44.080]  And we're seeing a frightening repeat of it, even the same fascist trappings.
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:45.081]  Right, right.
[02:02:45.541 --> 02:02:46.943]  And another thing I wanted to say was,
[02:02:48.256 --> 02:02:50.237]  I'm listening on shortwave.
[02:02:50.577 --> 02:02:56.279]  I picked up Ramsey Clark's speech to the National Press Club.
[02:02:56.419 --> 02:02:57.199]  It was very good.
[02:02:57.239 --> 02:03:02.160]  I don't agree with Clark on a lot of things, but he was definitely on target during that speech.
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:03.961]  He's a fellow Texan of yours.
[02:03:05.661 --> 02:03:06.102]  He what?
[02:03:06.642 --> 02:03:08.002]  Isn't he a fellow Texan?
[02:03:08.802 --> 02:03:11.963]  Well, yeah, he helped us rebuild the Branstavetian Church.
[02:03:12.003 --> 02:03:15.585]  Yeah, he did a great speech there.
[02:03:15.645 --> 02:03:16.585]  I heard most of it.
[02:03:17.575 --> 02:03:19.336]  For those who don't know, we're not Branch Davidians.
[02:03:19.356 --> 02:03:22.658]  We built a memorial church there for them.
[02:03:22.938 --> 02:03:24.939]  Alright, Elias, thanks for the call.
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:30.123]  Yeah, that was a good speech he gave about the total media control, the manipulation, the takeover.
[02:03:30.563 --> 02:03:37.407]  I mean, now they're talking about invading North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Syria, endless war.
[02:03:37.427 --> 02:03:39.968]  You know, Bush said a hundred year war, Barry.
[02:03:40.529 --> 02:03:42.670]  When did we hear talk of hundred year wars?
[02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:43.991]  Endless war for peace?
[02:03:44.611 --> 02:03:46.873]  Yeah, well, you know, again, it's one of the parallels.
[02:03:46.913 --> 02:03:55.158]  I'm drawing up actually a whole spreadsheet, you know, a computer spreadsheet of the parallels between the Bush regime and Hitler.
[02:03:55.683 --> 02:04:03.948]  And Hitler, you can read it in the histories about him, he said every country should have a good war at least every twenty years.
[02:04:04.008 --> 02:04:07.090]  He considered it cleaned up people's souls or something like that.
[02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:15.896]  By the way, Alex, may I put in something here that before we finish our time together, I have a question for you that I'm burning to ask.
[02:04:15.936 --> 02:04:16.296]  Okay.
[02:04:16.556 --> 02:04:18.597]  Let's make sure that... Do you want me to ask it now?
[02:04:18.917 --> 02:04:19.718]  Go ahead, sure.
[02:04:19.958 --> 02:04:20.298]  It's this.
[02:04:20.739 --> 02:04:22.860]  You and I have had, and many others,
[02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:28.643]  I've had very parallel experiences since 9-11 where we twigged to the extreme fishiness of it.
[02:04:28.763 --> 02:04:31.064]  We've been talking about it, seeing all sorts of reactions.
[02:04:31.444 --> 02:04:37.547]  Incredibly, very, very positive reactions where you would think that, and most people think, oh my gosh, you'd get negative ones.
[02:04:37.967 --> 02:04:39.228]  So we've been going through this.
[02:04:39.468 --> 02:04:44.210]  Now, I am detecting, I think, and this is what I want to ask you, what you're detecting.
[02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:46.531]  I seem to feel, it's 20 minutes, 20 months, 20 months,
[02:04:49.193 --> 02:04:54.558]  To the day, last Sunday, since this thing happened, this 9-11 thing happened.
[02:04:55.179 --> 02:05:05.790]  And I get the feeling that somehow, in the mass public, there is a stirring of a willingness to actually start to ask some serious questions about it.
[02:05:05.970 --> 02:05:10.175]  Now, you're a big radio guy, big audience, bigger than I have.
[02:05:10.615 --> 02:05:11.436]  What are you picking up?
[02:05:12.384 --> 02:05:25.790]  No, I'm getting the exact same thing, because more and more prominent people... I mean, when the German technology minister comes out and says the globalists did it, the military did it, for open world dictatorship, I mean, they're in trouble!
[02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:38.096]  There are thousands of hosts that I know of, well, let's just say hundreds, but there's thousands out there that are discussing it, thousands of websites, dozens of videos, hundreds of books,
[02:05:39.777 --> 02:05:41.198]  They've got to go for it all now.
[02:05:41.258 --> 02:05:41.938]  That's the problem.
[02:05:41.959 --> 02:05:43.319]  They're going to keep turning the heat up.
[02:05:43.639 --> 02:05:45.220]  We're probably going to see more terror.
[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:51.183]  These Homeland Security drills, these top-off drills are for martial law.
[02:05:51.203 --> 02:05:52.383]  They sit under a red alert.
[02:05:52.424 --> 02:05:53.404]  We can't leave our houses.
[02:05:53.444 --> 02:05:54.084]  We'll be the enemy.
[02:05:54.545 --> 02:05:57.706]  I think that regardless they were going to drop the hammer, but they're racing.
[02:05:58.146 --> 02:06:00.447]  I think they're probably going to drop the hammer and accelerate things.
[02:06:00.467 --> 02:06:01.308]  They've got to.
[02:06:01.668 --> 02:06:04.089]  They're in like a terminal velocity for their empire.
[02:06:04.349 --> 02:06:07.091]  They've got to go to the next level or they're going to implode.
[02:06:07.111 --> 02:06:07.871]  Yeah.
[02:06:08.952 --> 02:06:10.132]  That rings true to me, Alex.
[02:06:10.192 --> 02:06:12.174]  Now, let me ask you another question.
[02:06:14.135 --> 02:06:17.538]  People like you and I, we know it's the only game in town.
[02:06:17.578 --> 02:06:19.099]  We've got to speak the truth as we see it.
[02:06:19.159 --> 02:06:22.962]  We've got to continue to learn, to refine our understandings.
[02:06:23.062 --> 02:06:27.105]  It's a lifelong job being a student of everything and speaking out without fear.
[02:06:27.505 --> 02:06:28.145]  We have to do that.
[02:06:28.245 --> 02:06:29.046]  We are doing that.
[02:06:29.086 --> 02:06:30.147]  A lot of people are doing that.
[02:06:30.247 --> 02:06:35.310]  And yet, we do know at the same time that the mass consciousness is actually false on this.
[02:06:35.371 --> 02:06:36.872]  It's a false consciousness.
[02:06:38.692 --> 02:06:53.676]  90% of us could all know the truth, but we don't talk to each other, we don't have the venues, so Peter Jennings says we're still all buying it, so that creates the illusion that everybody else is against us, so that keeps us from basically crystallizing and connecting.
[02:06:54.176 --> 02:06:57.457]  We've got to push that over the edge, and it's going to happen.
[02:06:59.013 --> 02:07:09.001]  I was dreaming, you know, dreaming in Technicolor, that a large paper such as the New York Times, or even a Canadian paper, and I went to journalists, I went to top journalists, investigative journalists.
[02:07:09.502 --> 02:07:13.445]  I've done investigative journalism, I'm partly an investigative journalist, but I'm primarily not.
[02:07:13.485 --> 02:07:15.927]  I'm primarily a regular journalist and a commentator.
[02:07:16.147 --> 02:07:19.450]  I went to these people, I went to the two top investigative reporters in Canada.
[02:07:19.890 --> 02:07:21.792]  Early on, I said, there's a huge story here.
[02:07:22.072 --> 02:07:23.393]  They say, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:07:23.473 --> 02:07:25.814]  One just refuses to look at it to this day.
[02:07:26.095 --> 02:07:27.616]  The other one said, yeah, I think I'll do something.
[02:07:27.736 --> 02:07:28.236]  Never did.
[02:07:28.857 --> 02:07:44.268]  You know, it's incredible that if one major daily newspaper in the United States or Canada were to come out with a series saying, look, we've got big questions, put it on the front page, big headline, they would collect more journalistic, they'd have to invent new journalistic prizes for such a paper.
[02:07:44.588 --> 02:07:46.990]  And that could really be an iconic turning point.
[02:07:47.010 --> 02:07:48.651]  But I guess it's not going to happen, eh, Alex?
[02:07:50.575 --> 02:07:53.477]  Well, I mean, when you talk about the New York Times and these guys, they're all owned.
[02:07:53.517 --> 02:07:59.141]  I mean, the owners of the Washington Post go to the Bilderberg Group meetings, who are openly calling for world government, so... Yep.
[02:07:59.642 --> 02:08:01.943]  Like, in other words, it just ain't gonna happen that way, eh?
[02:08:02.003 --> 02:08:04.725]  Well, they're putting out whitewashes... Like, there won't be another Pentagon Papers.
[02:08:05.085 --> 02:08:06.766]  Well, I mean, first they said there's no prior knowledge.
[02:08:06.786 --> 02:08:09.728]  We prove that, they go, okay, but it's an accident, just give us more power.
[02:08:10.169 --> 02:08:12.750]  Okay, there is some motive, but let's not discuss it.
[02:08:12.991 --> 02:08:17.974]  They're having to say something just to alleviate, like, we go, oh, the media's on to it.
[02:08:18.641 --> 02:08:19.662]  But it's amazing.
[02:08:19.702 --> 02:08:21.683]  Let's go ahead and go to some calls here.
[02:08:21.703 --> 02:08:23.365]  Thanks for answering that, Alex.
[02:08:23.705 --> 02:08:24.165]  Oh, you bet.
[02:08:24.205 --> 02:08:25.446]  Let's talk to Ken in Iowa.
[02:08:25.486 --> 02:08:26.867]  Ken, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:08:26.907 --> 02:08:27.288]  Go ahead.
[02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:29.309]  Hello?
[02:08:29.549 --> 02:08:30.110]  Yes, Ken.
[02:08:30.690 --> 02:08:31.531]  Hello.
[02:08:31.571 --> 02:08:32.452]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:08:33.032 --> 02:08:34.313]  I had a couple questions.
[02:08:35.294 --> 02:08:40.578]  First, I don't know if you've ever heard of the Strecker Mirandum by Dr. Strecker.
[02:08:42.216 --> 02:08:46.798]  He was, I only read a paper of his, but it was about AIDS and how that was created by man.
[02:08:47.138 --> 02:08:48.658]  Boy, that's a mad fact.
[02:08:48.678 --> 02:08:53.900]  I've done whole shows on it, we have the weapons documents, we have the patents created by the government, and yeah.
[02:08:54.700 --> 02:09:01.323]  Well, I was going to ask you, do you think that this whole SARS thing is like another population type control by the U.N.? ?
[02:09:01.823 --> 02:09:02.524]  I think so.
[02:09:19.878 --> 02:09:24.922]  You know, Putin got caught blowing up his own buildings in 1999 to get martial law going in Russia again.
[02:09:24.942 --> 02:09:27.184]  It's the same story over and over again.
[02:09:27.224 --> 02:09:30.546]  They've got different scripts they could activate.
[02:09:30.566 --> 02:09:45.338]  Their biggest problem is there's only a few thousand globalists, a few thousand minions they can trust, and they're trying to basically do a balancing act with, you know, a hundred plates in each hand, and the gyrations they're having to follow are getting harder and harder.
[02:09:45.959 --> 02:09:49.321]  Is that why they had that kind of, like with the anthrax on September 11th?
[02:09:49.341 --> 02:09:53.123]  Yeah, anthrax turned out in Fort Detrick, Maryland, most weaponized form ever seen.
[02:09:53.203 --> 02:09:57.566]  Bush on Cipro with his cabinet on September 10th, four weeks before it showed up in Boca Raton.
[02:09:57.846 --> 02:09:58.166]  Yeah.
[02:09:59.007 --> 02:10:02.208]  Yeah, one guy called it government by anthrax.
[02:10:03.369 --> 02:10:03.969]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:08.312]  It came out in Reuters overseas that, oh yeah, the government did it, and then you never heard about it again.
[02:10:09.574 --> 02:10:11.716]  Your caller was asking about SARS, Alex.
[02:10:12.176 --> 02:10:12.476]  Yes.
[02:10:12.757 --> 02:10:15.318]  And for my part, I do think it's really fishy.
[02:10:16.059 --> 02:10:20.702]  There's a microbiologist in Vancouver, BC, and he's not alone.
[02:10:20.742 --> 02:10:22.224]  There's another one in Winnipeg.
[02:10:22.544 --> 02:10:25.246]  Just to consider microbiologists here north of the border.
[02:10:25.746 --> 02:10:29.388]  And they just say they cannot trace it down as a natural coronavirus.
[02:10:30.048 --> 02:10:33.109]  They just say we cannot find it in nature.
[02:10:33.209 --> 02:10:35.410]  And some Russian scientists have said the same thing.
[02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:38.011]  It looks suspiciously as if it's probably man-made.
[02:10:38.452 --> 02:10:40.512]  I also think it's suspicious about where it started.
[02:10:40.572 --> 02:10:47.455]  I know Guangdong province is a province where humans and other animals, like chickens and so on, live in close proximity.
[02:10:47.475 --> 02:10:48.736]  And you can have the virus jump
[02:10:49.116 --> 02:10:51.818]  From the non-human animal population.
[02:10:51.898 --> 02:10:53.780]  Yeah, that's when you have too many in a mash.
[02:10:54.100 --> 02:10:56.281]  Thanks for the call, Ken.
[02:10:56.902 --> 02:11:01.105]  Let's talk to Dan in California.
[02:11:01.145 --> 02:11:03.006]  You're on the air, or David in California.
[02:11:03.027 --> 02:11:03.427]  Go ahead.
[02:11:03.947 --> 02:11:04.848]  Hey Alex, good morning.
[02:11:05.248 --> 02:11:05.688]  How you doing?
[02:11:05.989 --> 02:11:07.370]  Got another great show going, man.
[02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:08.551]  I just have a brief comment.
[02:11:10.272 --> 02:11:15.656]  Occasionally you apologize for getting so wound up and yelling and all that, but I just want you to know that
[02:11:16.311 --> 02:11:18.833]  The stuff that you're yelling about deserves to be yelled about, man.
[02:11:18.853 --> 02:11:21.116]  So don't take it too hard when you get wound up.
[02:11:21.976 --> 02:11:24.779]  Sometimes it helps us that you get so wound up.
[02:11:25.239 --> 02:11:39.393]  So let me just finish by saying to those people who want to knuckle under to all these clowns out there that want to allow this tyranny to come down on us, you all better get ready to click your heels.
[02:11:39.433 --> 02:11:41.535]  Learn how to click your heels and learn how to say,
[02:11:41.980 --> 02:11:44.622]  Because that's what's coming, people.
[02:11:44.662 --> 02:11:45.883]  Just get used to it.
[02:11:45.903 --> 02:11:52.589]  You know, I watched Reggie a year ago on TV, on C-SPAN, and he said, to have a job, you'll have a federal ID card.
[02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:54.010]  That you'll be screened.
[02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:57.392]  There's going to be troops in the factories, like something out of Red Dawn.
[02:11:58.113 --> 02:12:02.817]  I mean, folks, the country they're setting up is nightmarish.
[02:12:04.618 --> 02:12:05.559]  You know, the last word.
[02:12:06.215 --> 02:12:12.997]  In control of labor is a labor camp, where people don't get paid at all, they just get the smallest rations they can.
[02:12:13.097 --> 02:12:18.739]  Did you hear about the Oregon law, where if one protester blocks a street, they all get life in prison in a labor camp?
[02:12:19.059 --> 02:12:19.359]  Yeah.
[02:12:19.599 --> 02:12:21.860]  It actually says, labor camp.
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:22.380]  Yep.
[02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:23.680]  Yep.
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:24.921]  Anyway, thanks Alex.
[02:12:24.941 --> 02:12:28.402]  Did you hear about the Rocky Mountain News, where they've got incinerators and mass graves?
[02:12:30.102 --> 02:12:31.362]  I'm not kidding, it says it!
[02:12:31.623 --> 02:12:32.903]  It's because they love us, Alex.
[02:12:34.406 --> 02:12:36.948]  Well, they're not going to be able to get away with it and pull it, and thanks for the call.
[02:12:37.008 --> 02:12:38.849]  I like that sense of humor from California.
[02:12:39.389 --> 02:12:39.769]  You know what?
[02:12:39.829 --> 02:12:45.313]  I think what they're doing is so horrible, I think the laziness and the decadence is actually going to work against them.
[02:12:45.353 --> 02:12:48.515]  I mean, the health care workers wouldn't take the smallpox shot, would they?
[02:12:48.735 --> 02:12:49.475]  Yep, good point.
[02:12:50.896 --> 02:12:54.078]  One more segment with us and I'll let you go, because I want you to have a chance to say some final words.
[02:12:54.098 --> 02:12:55.079]  I've been taking all these calls.
[02:12:55.139 --> 02:12:57.961]  Stay right there, Barry, and we'll come back to you.
[02:12:58.201 --> 02:12:58.521]  Will do.
[02:12:59.261 --> 02:13:02.844]  Alright, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net.
[02:13:03.843 --> 02:13:07.712]  And we'll come back and if there's any websites that Barry wants to plug, that's great.
[02:13:08.294 --> 02:13:10.218]  He's the Vision TV media critic.
[02:13:10.258 --> 02:13:13.125]  He's come out and told the truth about the globalists because he cares about humanity.
[02:13:15.450 --> 02:13:19.334]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:13:19.554 --> 02:13:25.019]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.

[02:13:35.829 --> 02:13:40.153]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:13:40.353 --> 02:13:48.719]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:55.344]  They reduce Nitrate and unwanted metals such as Lead, Mercury, Aluminum, Copper and Foul tastes like Chlorine and Sulfur odors.

[02:14:57.995 --> 02:14:58.395]  I think so.
[02:15:15.265 --> 02:15:19.167]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:15:19.387 --> 02:15:31.673]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:15:32.093 --> 02:15:32.493]  The U.S.
[02:15:32.553 --> 02:15:38.116]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:15:38.516 --> 02:15:40.737]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:15:42.598 --> 02:15:43.658]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:15:43.698 --> 02:15:46.539]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:15:46.659 --> 02:15:52.660]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:15:53.101 --> 02:15:56.461]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[02:15:56.541 --> 02:16:02.863]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[02:16:03.442 --> 02:16:07.469]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[02:16:07.569 --> 02:16:07.830]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:16:07.850 --> 02:16:08.150]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:16:14.711 --> 02:16:17.454]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[02:16:17.695 --> 02:16:24.022]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[02:16:24.322 --> 02:16:30.209]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them, but still have them safe and sound?
[02:16:30.670 --> 02:16:34.414]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax-exempt?
[02:16:35.114 --> 02:16:36.655]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[02:16:36.935 --> 02:16:37.776]  Well, there is a way.
[02:16:38.036 --> 02:16:44.141]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[02:16:44.501 --> 02:16:54.769]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years, and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[02:16:54.829 --> 02:16:55.629]  Constitution.
[02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:57.511]  You don't have to go offshore to do it, either.
[02:16:57.811 --> 02:17:00.113]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[02:17:00.573 --> 02:17:08.279]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:17:08.559 --> 02:17:13.362]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:17:15.644 --> 02:17:21.288]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:24.530]  Alright, one final
[02:17:26.022 --> 02:17:28.403]  Alright, my question is, what do you think of these Texas Democrats?
[02:17:54.404 --> 02:17:58.248]  I think it's wonderful that they're not going along with the control.
[02:17:58.288 --> 02:18:06.255]  This is what they used to do 100 years ago in this country, 200 years ago in this country, walking out, shutting government down is what the Founding Fathers called for.
[02:18:06.636 --> 02:18:09.899]  Now hundreds of evil bills, I've looked at them, almost all of them are bad.
[02:18:10.479 --> 02:18:16.864]  I mean, we've got millions of laws in this country, hundreds of thousands for each major state, and them walking out is a great tactic.
[02:18:16.924 --> 02:18:18.425]  Gridlock in government is good.
[02:18:18.765 --> 02:18:24.609]  Separation of powers, they're not going along with the federal power grab going on in Texas, and I hope it spreads.
[02:18:24.849 --> 02:18:31.594]  Were you aware of the arrest warrant for 53 members of the House, and they've arrested some other ones here in Texas for refusing to... Yes, I am.
[02:18:31.874 --> 02:18:35.356]  And you know that... I wanted to get Barry's response.
[02:18:35.376 --> 02:18:35.997]  Were you aware of that?
[02:18:36.797 --> 02:18:39.518]  Yeah, I read about that in the papers.
[02:18:40.138 --> 02:18:42.319]  I know Tim in Oklahoma, he's got something to say there.
[02:18:42.899 --> 02:18:50.441]  I'll just quickly put in that when I read the legislation that the Republicans in Texas are trying to push through, it's practically blood-curdling.
[02:18:50.461 --> 02:18:56.242]  They just want to close down anything that's compassionate and build up everything for everybody who's already... Well, let me explain.
[02:18:56.282 --> 02:19:02.344]  They use socialism to get us all addicted to government, then they transfer into the fascist phase of privatization.
[02:19:02.744 --> 02:19:03.324]  It's amazing.
[02:19:03.364 --> 02:19:03.864]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:19:05.005 --> 02:19:12.629]  Yeah, and also that the government of Oklahoma actually welcomes and applauds the Texas insurgency.
[02:19:13.250 --> 02:19:13.910]  Well, that's good.
[02:19:13.930 --> 02:19:18.073]  I mean, if the Republicans were running out and leaving government to fall apart, I'd love it.
[02:19:18.113 --> 02:19:18.913]  We need more of this.
[02:19:19.574 --> 02:19:24.617]  And is this maybe something that the actual D.C.
[02:19:24.857 --> 02:19:27.099]  Democrats need to look at as being a
[02:19:28.590 --> 02:19:30.352]  Insurgency against Republicans?
[02:19:30.392 --> 02:19:36.877]  I'm not an expert on those particular Roberts rules, but I think they're the same, basically, and it is a good idea.
[02:19:36.897 --> 02:19:42.762]  I mean, basically, the Democrats have been a bunch of spineless weasels in D.C.
[02:19:42.802 --> 02:19:46.125]  for the most part, bending over for whatever legislation they want.
[02:19:46.145 --> 02:19:47.206]  Well, they're all on the same trough.
[02:19:47.266 --> 02:19:48.247]  They're all on the same trough.
[02:19:49.028 --> 02:19:49.268]  Yeah.
[02:19:49.668 --> 02:19:50.768]  And it's just embarrassing.
[02:19:50.829 --> 02:19:55.570]  I mean, if we want to get Bush out of office, which I think is the actual deal.
[02:19:55.950 --> 02:19:57.150]  Let me be clear, sir.
[02:19:57.730 --> 02:19:58.431]  This can hurt us.
[02:19:58.951 --> 02:19:59.891]  Bush is a puppet.
[02:19:59.971 --> 02:20:00.911]  Clinton was a puppet.
[02:20:01.351 --> 02:20:02.512]  It's the current phase.
[02:20:02.712 --> 02:20:03.872]  That's why all this is happening.
[02:20:03.912 --> 02:20:05.633]  It's the New World Order takeover.
[02:20:09.013 --> 02:20:10.394]  Look, you put John Kerry in there.
[02:20:10.434 --> 02:20:12.194]  They're both from skull and bones.
[02:20:12.694 --> 02:20:13.535]  It's the same choice.
[02:20:13.575 --> 02:20:13.935]  Go ahead.
[02:20:14.715 --> 02:20:17.936]  But I really think that, you know, in order for
[02:20:19.893 --> 02:20:25.395]  Anything to happen right now, somebody's got to stand up and have a backbone against this entire New World Order.
[02:20:25.415 --> 02:20:26.835]  No, I think Bush should be impeached.
[02:20:26.895 --> 02:20:28.236]  I thought Bill Clinton should be impeached.
[02:20:28.356 --> 02:20:29.276]  I hardly agree with you.
[02:20:29.856 --> 02:20:32.337]  I'm just saying, don't think that some Democrat's going to save you.
[02:20:32.877 --> 02:20:35.898]  Well, it's pretty much, I'm thinking, all we've got right now.
[02:20:36.158 --> 02:20:38.939]  Well, maybe the separation of powers.
[02:20:38.959 --> 02:20:42.920]  I mean, if we had an Al Gore, the conservatives would be awake to his evil and we wouldn't be in this shape.
[02:20:44.324 --> 02:20:46.205]  Usually conservatives are more active.
[02:20:46.225 --> 02:20:47.845]  It gets into a complex political issue.
[02:20:47.865 --> 02:20:48.406]  Thanks for the call.
[02:20:48.426 --> 02:20:49.346]  I've got to let you go.
[02:20:49.366 --> 02:20:50.966]  You've got a few minutes left, Barry.
[02:20:51.006 --> 02:20:52.687]  Anything else you want to add to the listenership?
[02:20:53.027 --> 02:20:57.148]  Well, I would, and I'd like to follow up on what Tim was saying, and I really agree with Tim.
[02:20:58.049 --> 02:21:07.792]  I think, and also following up on your responses to the questions that I was asking you, Alex, I think change never, ever starts at the center.
[02:21:08.272 --> 02:21:11.993]  Now, the Democrats are at the center, regrettably, most of them.
[02:21:13.059 --> 02:21:14.700]  Change always happens at the fringes.
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:19.123]  I don't want to say fringes in the sense of just a fringe movement or fringe idea.
[02:21:19.243 --> 02:21:22.905]  It's always highly motivated, cutting-edge groups that change history.
[02:21:22.985 --> 02:21:23.485]  Exactly.
[02:21:23.846 --> 02:21:26.287]  You know, first, they cry in the wilderness at first.
[02:21:26.667 --> 02:21:29.569]  And something I like is that statement I believe Gandhi made.
[02:21:29.589 --> 02:21:32.871]  He said, first they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:58.420]  And I think that there's enough of us at the so-called fringes, enough of us who are outside of the power centers, who aren't corrupted by those power centers, and I think if we gain enough strength, and everybody who has the slightest suspicion, even one suspicion, about the events of 9-11, for instance, has got a duty, I would say it's a duty, to A. not be afraid,
[02:22:00.402 --> 02:22:01.122]  Tell 10 people.
[02:22:01.402 --> 02:22:06.904]  You know that somebody said that the greatest peace talks in the world are the ones done over people's back fences.
[02:22:07.484 --> 02:22:09.605]  And what you gotta do is talk to your neighbors.
[02:22:09.645 --> 02:22:10.525]  Do whatever you can.
[02:22:10.605 --> 02:22:12.426]  If you're a plumber, talk to your customers.
[02:22:12.446 --> 02:22:14.227]  You know, if you're a journalist, go on air.
[02:22:14.927 --> 02:22:19.589]  And if you're a psychiatrist, tell people they're crazy if they believe in Bush.
[02:22:19.789 --> 02:22:21.269]  And I think everybody can do something.
[02:22:21.289 --> 02:22:22.970]  Absolutely, everybody can do something.
[02:22:22.990 --> 02:22:26.951]  The important thing is not to feel fear, to educate yourself, and then do something.
[02:22:27.171 --> 02:22:29.072]  Well, absolutely, and we don't have a choice.
[02:22:29.132 --> 02:22:31.392]  I mean, this system is just attacking us at every level.
[02:22:31.772 --> 02:22:34.073]  If folks want a copy of your video, The Grand Deception, 416-651-5588.
[02:22:34.093 --> 02:22:34.333]  416-651-5588.
[02:22:35.773 --> 02:22:41.595]  Any websites you want to plug?
[02:22:41.775 --> 02:22:44.096]  Well, I think a good website, there's a lot of them, you know.
[02:22:44.336 --> 02:22:46.576]  You probably have a deception dollar with you, right, Alex?
[02:22:47.017 --> 02:22:47.457]  Oh, sure.
[02:22:47.557 --> 02:22:48.837]  Yeah, so I like the one, 911PI.
[02:22:48.977 --> 02:22:49.377]  991peterindia.com.
[02:22:49.517 --> 02:22:51.658]  And you can go to a lot of websites.
[02:22:56.159 --> 02:22:57.200]  All right, gotta let you go.
[02:22:57.220 --> 02:22:58.620]  Great having you on for an hour and a half.
[02:22:58.640 --> 02:22:59.381]  We'll have you back up.
[02:22:59.421 --> 02:22:59.961]  Godspeed.
[02:23:00.081 --> 02:23:00.581]  Thank you.
[02:23:00.862 --> 02:23:01.602]  I'll be right by.
[02:23:01.622 --> 02:23:02.102]  Stay with me.
[02:23:05.584 --> 02:23:06.484]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.965 --> 02:23:08.585]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:08.605 --> 02:23:12.287]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.369 --> 02:23:21.512]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:23:22.250 --> 02:23:26.318]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most action.
[02:23:26.358 --> 02:23:26.318]  7605 9200.
[02:23:26.458 --> 02:23:26.779]  Call today.
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:56.182]  Folks, we're dealing with a bunch of fruitcakes that go to Bohemian Grove and dress up in wizard outfits.
[02:23:57.723 --> 02:24:02.764]  We're dealing with ruthless people on unbelievable power trips, and I'm not going to put up with it.
[02:24:03.345 --> 02:24:05.926]  My family is not their property, not their slaves.
[02:24:07.166 --> 02:24:09.807]  And you've just got to face the reality of how crazy the globalists are.
[02:24:09.827 --> 02:24:12.948]  You know, and this whole left-wing thing, we've had some of that in the last few hours.
[02:24:13.689 --> 02:24:19.391]  But the guest admitted, and he's a prominent journalist, that the left-wing isn't going to save you, the right-wing isn't going to save you.
[02:24:20.427 --> 02:24:21.667]  God's going to save you.
[02:24:21.707 --> 02:24:22.948]  God's got to give you the strength.
[02:24:22.968 --> 02:24:26.169]  You've got to ask God for the strength to stand up against this evil and count the cost.
[02:24:26.649 --> 02:24:29.230]  Think about why we have the liberty and the freedoms we have.
[02:24:29.530 --> 02:24:31.150]  Because people stood up before us.
[02:24:31.210 --> 02:24:37.252]  We owe them and the future and the present a debt to stand up and do the right thing.
[02:24:37.632 --> 02:24:41.493]  Here's Joseph Farah, World Net Daily, one of the biggest news websites out there.
[02:24:41.913 --> 02:24:44.954]  The growing threat of fascism between the lines of Joseph Farah.
[02:24:45.629 --> 02:24:54.795]  I believe for some time now, the greatest threat to America's freedoms is not from socialism or communism, but rather an ism you seldom hear about these days, fascism!
[02:24:56.216 --> 02:24:59.498]  And he goes into how America is being turned into a fascist police state.
[02:25:00.258 --> 02:25:04.661]  And the NRA now admits there's a plan to ban almost all the guns in the country.
[02:25:05.381 --> 02:25:08.983]  In the new assault weapons ban, they're going to add a bunch of stuff and Bush says he'll sign it.
[02:25:09.704 --> 02:25:11.425]  This is deadly serious, folks.
[02:25:11.505 --> 02:25:12.726]  The Democrats are the threat.
[02:25:13.806 --> 02:25:14.947]  So are the Republicans.
[02:25:14.967 --> 02:25:17.589]  They're a bunch of sellouts to the New World Order.
[02:25:17.629 --> 02:25:18.409]  They're rubber stamps.
[02:25:18.449 --> 02:25:22.112]  And I think obsessing too much on George W. Bush is a mistake.
[02:25:22.812 --> 02:25:25.755]  George Bush is just told to do, you know, what he does.
[02:25:25.835 --> 02:25:26.635]  Buy his handlers.
[02:25:26.675 --> 02:25:28.016]  He reads off teleprompters.
[02:25:28.857 --> 02:25:29.517]  It's a joke.
[02:25:29.617 --> 02:25:33.840]  So the one problem we've had on this show is focusing too much on Bush.
[02:25:34.881 --> 02:25:35.501]  And I'm sorry.
[02:25:35.962 --> 02:25:38.563]  The last year and a half of Clinton's presidency, I said, you know what?
[02:25:38.583 --> 02:25:40.585]  I've been bashing this guy for six years, seven years.
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:43.522]  Let's stop bashing him, because he's just a puppet.
[02:25:43.562 --> 02:25:45.103]  And I said, you watch George Bush.
[02:25:45.543 --> 02:25:49.746]  He's going to protect him in Pardongate when he gets out of office.
[02:25:49.766 --> 02:25:50.267]  And you know what?
[02:25:50.287 --> 02:25:50.827]  That happened.
[02:25:51.067 --> 02:25:58.733]  And if it's John Kerry in two years, or in six years, or whatever, you're going to see them protecting George Bush.
[02:26:00.274 --> 02:26:03.436]  It's going to be the same story, and it's going to be just as bad.
[02:26:03.477 --> 02:26:07.660]  And the left isn't going to do a thing about it until we deprogram them.
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:10.722]  And right now, I'm trying to deprogram the phony right wing.
[02:26:12.136 --> 02:26:13.277]  Let me launch into this news.
[02:26:14.277 --> 02:26:15.157]  It is very important.
[02:26:15.197 --> 02:26:33.585]  May 3rd, a secret report has now come out, almost 12 days later, and this is the account of an official warning given to American expatriates on May 3rd by the ambassador in Riyadh, that's the capital of Saudi Arabia, was written by a Halliburton oil firm employee!
[02:26:33.805 --> 02:26:34.846]  Oh my goodness!
[02:26:35.823 --> 02:26:38.585]  And, uh, it says, this is to pass on information from yesterday's meeting.
[02:26:38.625 --> 02:26:42.468]  The only person that spoke was Robert Jordan, U.S.
[02:26:42.528 --> 02:26:43.189]  Ambassador.
[02:26:43.249 --> 02:26:46.351]  The meeting was unusually short and the message blunt.
[02:26:46.471 --> 02:26:54.737]  Mr. Jordan said, when they go into war and about attacks, they're on housing complex in the walled areas of the cities.
[02:26:55.838 --> 02:26:56.859]  That's nothing compared
[02:26:57.825 --> 02:27:11.273]  To the evidence now from NBC News and the Times of London that Halliburton, excuse me, Carlisle Group formerly owned the company that was bombed and the company was being used as a quote CIA front and all the big head people were out of the building.
[02:27:12.014 --> 02:27:16.777]  Yet again, those stories are on Infowars.com.
[02:27:17.237 --> 02:27:21.560]  China may execute SARS quarantine violators, Reuters reports.
[02:27:22.353 --> 02:27:28.496]  And we heard that in our country they'll execute us if we try to run quarantine for any reason, even during a red alert, even if there isn't a problem.
[02:27:29.616 --> 02:27:34.418]  They said yesterday on the Scotsman that their police are going to shoot anybody that doesn't follow exact orders.
[02:27:34.438 --> 02:27:35.659]  This is all part of the new freedom.
[02:27:36.119 --> 02:27:36.820]  Globally.
[02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:41.662]  And an interesting story about a dead man left on the gym floor while others exercised.
[02:27:42.262 --> 02:27:46.264]  And I saw the story last year out of Canada where a woman had been raped and beaten.
[02:27:46.624 --> 02:27:50.926]  She laid there in a busy street for about seven hours, went into a coma,
[02:27:52.318 --> 02:27:56.021]  You've been beating the hell out of the lead pipe and people came to the windows and laughed at her.
[02:27:56.322 --> 02:27:57.983]  What happened to society?
[02:27:58.484 --> 02:28:07.812]  A cop a year ago in Austin got hit in the road, knocked onto the sidewalk, laid there in fire ants for an hour before another police officer drove by and helped him.
[02:28:08.232 --> 02:28:08.973]  He died.
[02:28:09.013 --> 02:28:11.515]  He probably would have lived if he'd have been given attention.
[02:28:12.116 --> 02:28:13.317]  This is sick!
[02:28:13.837 --> 02:28:15.659]  And I see it all the time.
[02:28:16.693 --> 02:28:25.138]  So wrapped up in your own little lives, that when something happens to you, everybody else is going to be evil, and there's going to be no good Samaritan there to help you.
[02:28:25.218 --> 02:28:26.019]  What happened to you?
[02:28:26.039 --> 02:28:27.900]  Well, you're mind-controlled by the media, folks.
[02:28:28.541 --> 02:28:30.702]  You're in the Matrix, big time!
[02:28:32.139 --> 02:28:35.521]  War crimes lawsuit filed against Tommy Franks in Belgium.
[02:28:35.541 --> 02:28:36.681]  This is CNS News.
[02:28:36.701 --> 02:28:40.603]  A group of Iraqis filed a lawsuit in Belgium on Wednesday against U.S.
[02:28:40.783 --> 02:28:47.306]  General Tommy Franks, accusing him of war crimes in connection with the use of plushard bombs and causing civilian casualties.
[02:28:47.326 --> 02:28:49.627]  The Belgian government moved quickly to denounce the lawsuit.
[02:28:50.127 --> 02:28:56.610]  A spokesman for the country's foreign minister and foreign minister, Luis Michel, had characterized the suit as a misuse of the existing law.
[02:28:57.859 --> 02:29:05.189]  Under the 93 War Crimes legislation, Belgium courts can try war crimes on suspects no matter where the alleged crimes are committed.
[02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:10.516]  Well, there's obviously... I mean, we've got a serious standard here.
[02:29:10.856 --> 02:29:13.019]  We're going to follow the standard we put on other congrees.
[02:29:13.059 --> 02:29:14.280]  You do have war crimes, okay?
[02:29:15.911 --> 02:29:19.252]  The Iraq War, let's be honest though, compared to taking over Germany was nothing.
[02:29:19.792 --> 02:29:32.094]  Though now, not giving serious services, paying Iraqis $20 a month as slaves, mowing down crowds of people like Tiananmen Square every day if they protest, that is evil and wrong, and that's big time.
[02:29:33.394 --> 02:29:40.315]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, with the news and information, how high can the Euro go?
[02:29:40.475 --> 02:29:42.716]  Analysts raised targets to $1.30.
[02:29:45.419 --> 02:29:50.662]  And it went up to about $1.18 against the dollar.
[02:29:50.722 --> 02:29:52.904]  Now it's down to about $1.15, but they say it's going to surge.
[02:29:53.284 --> 02:30:00.949]  Lay over that because the Treasury Secretary, Snow, continues to badmouth the dollar along with Greenspan and the rest of them.
[02:30:01.409 --> 02:30:01.769]  Update!
[02:30:01.849 --> 02:30:07.153]  Gold hits 10-week high, breaks currency link, Reuters Gold rose to its highest level in 10 weeks in Europe.
[02:30:07.593 --> 02:30:15.378]  On Thursday morning, despite a slightly stronger dollar and a new wave of economic and geopolitical anxiety thrust safe haven assets back into the limelight.
[02:30:15.938 --> 02:30:19.180]  The first time in days gold began to divorce itself from currency movements.
[02:30:19.661 --> 02:30:21.402]  Concentrate again on the gloomy U.S.
[02:30:21.502 --> 02:30:26.225]  economic outlook while this week's deadly bombings in Saudi Arabia burnish gold's safe haven.
[02:30:27.419 --> 02:30:28.139]  Allure.
[02:30:28.619 --> 02:30:29.560]  A denuing U.S.
[02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:31.800]  retail sales and import prices fall sharply.
[02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:33.181]  Retail plunge.
[02:30:33.801 --> 02:30:35.221]  Economic worry is up.
[02:30:35.881 --> 02:30:35.981]  U.S.
[02:30:36.021 --> 02:30:38.002]  retail sales fell unexpectedly in April.
[02:30:38.322 --> 02:30:41.503]  And import prices set a record decline, the government said on Wednesday.
[02:30:41.803 --> 02:30:45.844]  And reports that underscored worries about the economy's health.
[02:30:46.364 --> 02:30:50.405]  Commerce Department set a total retail purchase of 0.1% in April.
[02:30:50.726 --> 02:30:54.727]  In contrast to the predictions of an economist in Reuters poll, expected a rise of 0.4.
[02:30:57.435 --> 02:30:59.516]  Jaw-boning reality for Treasury Snow.
[02:30:59.596 --> 02:31:04.417]  I read out of the Baltimore Sun yesterday where Snow was bad-mouthing the dollar.
[02:31:04.457 --> 02:31:07.518]  That's real good, Treasury Secretary, with our fiat currency.
[02:31:07.538 --> 02:31:10.179]  But see, the Europeans really own our Federal Reserve.
[02:31:10.239 --> 02:31:11.799]  They want the Euro to shine.
[02:31:12.179 --> 02:31:14.000]  They want to hurt America, and they're doing it.
[02:31:14.020 --> 02:31:14.780]  We've been overtaken.
[02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:16.180]  There's no fight between the U.S.
[02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:17.180]  and Europe at the higher levels.
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:17.981]  They're all globalist.
[02:31:19.161 --> 02:31:22.062]  And it says, jaw-boning reality for Treasury Snow.
[02:31:22.142 --> 02:31:24.963]  Couldn't fight dollars drop if he wanted to, and he doesn't.
[02:31:25.523 --> 02:31:26.143]  Oh, that's nice.
[02:31:26.733 --> 02:31:37.078]  President Secretary John Snow this week sent the strongest signals yet that the Bush administration no longer believes in the so-called strong dollar policy, at least in terms of an active effort to hold or push up the value of the currency.
[02:31:37.758 --> 02:31:46.382]  Back in March, when he was still wet behind the ears in his roles as the Bush administration's top economic salesperson, Snow told reporters he wasn't worried about the recent slide in the greenback.
[02:31:47.183 --> 02:31:54.046]  When that sent the dollar tanking, he took it back short of by taking care, he emphasized later, that he believed in a strong dollar.
[02:31:55.026 --> 02:31:59.949]  Yeah, because the EU said they want a slow decline of the dollar as not to upset the American people.
[02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:06.632]  It's like slowly opening the borders, slowly taking your guns, slowly sucking your blood like a vampire when you're asleep.
[02:32:07.192 --> 02:32:11.014]  Snow set off a tempest in currency markets again this week, and we're telling ABC's this week.
[02:32:11.335 --> 02:32:14.256]  Obvious Treasury speculation manipulation here.
[02:32:14.696 --> 02:32:18.118]  This week, program on Sunday that yes, indeed, a lower dollar has helped U.S.
[02:32:18.158 --> 02:32:18.438]  exports.
[02:32:18.458 --> 02:32:19.359]  That is totally untrue.
[02:32:19.939 --> 02:32:31.610]  Hardly a revolutionary statement, but as it was, unaccompanied by any caveats about the benefits of a strong dollar to put added pressure on the currency, especially against the Euro, where it notched new four-year lows.
[02:32:35.033 --> 02:32:44.181]  Now, I've been telling you for three, almost four years now, that the Davos Switzerland Economic Forum said they were going to tank the dollar.
[02:32:44.562 --> 02:32:45.422]  None of this is a secret.
[02:32:47.142 --> 02:32:50.164]  10-year Treasury note yield falls a 45-year low.
[02:32:50.625 --> 02:32:55.828]  Washington Times, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 3.52% yesterday.
[02:32:55.848 --> 02:33:03.134]  A 45-year low after a report of weakening retail sales in April cramped a string of disappointing economic reports.
[02:33:03.634 --> 02:33:07.337]  There are signs elsewhere in the fixed-income markets of growing investor confidence.
[02:33:07.377 --> 02:33:08.678]  Yeah, you talk about propaganda.
[02:33:09.118 --> 02:33:10.559]  Sales recommendations rise
[02:33:11.661 --> 02:33:15.707]  400% sell, sell, sell, dump the stock financial times.
[02:33:16.068 --> 02:33:23.641]  The number of stock sell recommendations by Wall Street analysts quadrupled in the past year as banks and brokerage houses scrambled to revamp their research.
[02:33:23.901 --> 02:33:24.302]  Oh yeah!
[02:33:25.086 --> 02:33:33.531]  As of the beginning of May, sales constituted 10.5% of total advice, compared with 2.5% a year ago, according to Thomas First Call.
[02:33:34.171 --> 02:33:38.534]  Sale advance spiked to 10.6% in January, the highest percentage on record.
[02:33:38.554 --> 02:33:42.356]  Before 2002, the sales made up less than 2% of the recommendations.
[02:33:43.796 --> 02:33:46.338]  Jobs and Growth Plan may not do much for either.
[02:33:47.023 --> 02:33:47.703]  Says the L.A.
[02:33:47.783 --> 02:33:48.323]  Times.
[02:33:48.843 --> 02:33:52.664]  Congressional study raises doubts about effectiveness of Bush's tax-cutting proposals.
[02:33:52.704 --> 02:33:57.085]  Hey, any tax cut's good, folks, because they just print the money out of nowhere and it will help you great.
[02:33:57.785 --> 02:34:03.627]  But know that it isn't going to help because we don't have factories and that's just the facts.
[02:34:03.647 --> 02:34:05.907]  The basic economic indicators are not good.
[02:34:06.487 --> 02:34:10.428]  There are three reasons for doubting President Bush's tax-cutting jobs and growth plan now.
[02:34:11.343 --> 02:34:14.345]  Winding its way through Congress, and it goes on into it.
[02:34:14.465 --> 02:34:17.646]  Even the most favorable assessments conclude the plan wouldn't produce many new jobs.
[02:34:17.706 --> 02:34:20.608]  Yeah, because you can't compete against slaves in China no matter what you do.
[02:34:21.228 --> 02:34:22.469]  It gives a bunch of other examples.
[02:34:24.270 --> 02:34:24.950]  Other stories here.
[02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:25.230]  U.S.
[02:34:25.250 --> 02:34:26.771]  probe into Chechens-Saudi bombings.
[02:34:26.811 --> 02:34:27.971]  Putin's trying to link the two.
[02:34:28.011 --> 02:34:29.692]  Well, yeah, they probably are linked to the globalists.
[02:34:30.153 --> 02:34:31.553]  We know Putin likes to blow stuff up.
[02:34:31.593 --> 02:34:32.194]  He got caught.
[02:34:32.234 --> 02:34:35.275]  That's in about a hundred big papers in other past bombings.
[02:34:35.315 --> 02:34:40.138]  Lawmakers push Bush on gun ban stance.
[02:34:40.358 --> 02:34:40.838]  Reuters
[02:34:43.553 --> 02:34:50.442]  Press by some Democrats for an unambiguous signal that President Bush supports existing the 94 ban on assault weapons.
[02:34:50.502 --> 02:34:54.808]  A White House official on Wednesday insisted the ban's fate rested in the hands of Congress.
[02:34:54.848 --> 02:34:56.410]  Wait, Bush said last week he supported it.
[02:34:57.094 --> 02:35:04.837]  Bush in his 2000 campaign pledged to support renewal of the ban, which will expire next year unless Congress acts, but he has made no recent public statements and appearances about it.
[02:35:04.857 --> 02:35:05.237]  What do you mean?
[02:35:05.317 --> 02:35:08.058]  Card and Fleischer said they would do this, said they're for it.
[02:35:08.418 --> 02:35:13.740]  The ban on military-style semi-automatic assault weapons, leaving it in the spokesman to reiterate his position.
[02:35:14.020 --> 02:35:23.063]  By the way, good news, a New York court, despite the fact that Republican Governor Pataki wanted a gun ban, has thrown out the gun suit against gun manufacturers.
[02:35:23.623 --> 02:35:24.884]  But don't worry, they filed 500 more, so...
[02:35:27.092 --> 02:35:32.895]  Continuing here with that news, Senators criticize Rumsfeld over instability, plugging Iraq.
[02:35:33.316 --> 02:35:44.421]  Democratic and Republican Senators alike lashed out Wednesday at the military's efforts to stabilize Iraq, reprimanding Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld for not having a coherent plan to tackle the wave of violence sweeping Baghdad.
[02:35:45.302 --> 02:35:54.667]  Speaking in stern tones, the Black Herring Room members of the Senate's Defense Appropriations Subcommittee said they were concerned that crime and instability in Iraq threatened to undo the military victory against Saddam Hussein's regime.
[02:35:55.365 --> 02:35:56.786]  What's the IMF World Bank plan?
[02:35:56.826 --> 02:35:57.627]  Break down the country.
[02:35:57.667 --> 02:35:58.748]  This is all part of the plan.
[02:36:00.430 --> 02:36:06.516]  A number of people detained is on the rise in Russia to Stalinist levels, it says here in the Moscow Times.
[02:36:06.856 --> 02:36:12.581]  Just total slavery over there, but they don't call it communism, they call it crony capitalism.
[02:36:13.702 --> 02:36:15.144]  Same thing, command and control.
[02:36:16.351 --> 02:36:28.969]  By the way, with all this unsurity in the dollar and the bad-mouthing of the dollar by our own government, which is eroding the value of your money in the bank, you like being robbed, they're now saying maybe the UK needs to go ahead and go with the Euro because it's going to be so strong.
[02:36:29.089 --> 02:36:29.970]  That was the plan.
[02:36:30.311 --> 02:36:32.234]  Then Americans see the EU model.
[02:36:33.340 --> 02:36:40.903]  And say, oh, it works so good, let's merge with Mexico and everybody else, and our government will say, guess what, we already did it five years ago, don't you love us?
[02:36:40.983 --> 02:36:44.204]  People don't even know we're already merged, they're just now making it public.
[02:36:44.624 --> 02:36:50.266]  But then they got other spin articles out there, because 70 plus percent of the British people are against the Euro.
[02:36:50.606 --> 02:36:56.689]  UK not ready for the Euro, Chancellor Gordon Brown has concluded the UK is not yet ready to join the Euro, the BBC has learned.
[02:36:57.089 --> 02:36:57.649]  Yeah, because
[02:36:58.209 --> 02:37:01.392]  They can't have a referendum because people aren't going along with it.
[02:37:01.412 --> 02:37:03.873]  Of course, in Germany and France, they didn't allow a referendum.
[02:37:03.893 --> 02:37:07.436]  They just said, you're doing it, despite the fact that 80% were against it there.
[02:37:08.117 --> 02:37:09.338]  All part of the freedom.
[02:37:10.278 --> 02:37:11.059]  Here's the BBC.
[02:37:11.079 --> 02:37:12.800]  I already mentioned this, but here's more to tell you.
[02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:14.141]  Oh, I'm just shotgunning through the news.
[02:37:14.161 --> 02:37:15.162]  Sorry I'm going so fast.
[02:37:16.477 --> 02:37:17.497]  Court clears U.S.
[02:37:17.537 --> 02:37:18.178]  gun makers.
[02:37:18.198 --> 02:37:18.578]  A U.S.
[02:37:18.598 --> 02:37:28.542]  jury has rejected a bid by a leading civil rights group to hold a number of gun makers liable for handgun killings, but it has said it was undecided on the liability of 23 other manufacturers.
[02:37:28.582 --> 02:37:29.262]  That's bad news.
[02:37:29.882 --> 02:37:32.723]  Case brought by the National Association of Advancement for Colored People.
[02:37:33.163 --> 02:37:37.365]  The New York area blamed the gun makers for the growing violence in the city's black and Hispanic communities.
[02:37:37.805 --> 02:37:41.086]  Hey, NAACP, why are you supporting Klan policies?
[02:37:41.346 --> 02:37:44.127]  The first gun laws were against black people by the Klan in the South.
[02:37:44.147 --> 02:37:44.747]  I hope you know that.
[02:37:45.227 --> 02:37:47.388]  The verdict is a significant victory for the gun manufacturers.
[02:37:47.448 --> 02:37:48.248]  It's across U.S.
[02:37:48.388 --> 02:37:49.068]  dozens of cities.
[02:37:49.788 --> 02:37:52.449]  The case is based on the successful tobacco industry lawsuits.
[02:37:52.549 --> 02:37:53.249]  And now they're getting ready.
[02:37:53.449 --> 02:37:57.490]  They are suing Nabisco and the cookie, the Oreo.
[02:37:57.550 --> 02:37:58.971]  So this is the control freak nature.
[02:37:59.391 --> 02:38:01.952]  And you'll have to scan your national ID card to get food.
[02:38:01.992 --> 02:38:02.692]  This is official.
[02:38:03.812 --> 02:38:06.313]  And they will tax you if they say the food isn't good for you.
[02:38:06.333 --> 02:38:07.033]  I hope you enjoy that.
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:13.744]  And, uh, it says firearms murders in the leading cause of death for black men 15 to 34 in the U.S.
[02:38:13.784 --> 02:38:16.766]  Yeah, and it happens in cities where they have almost total gun bans.
[02:38:17.967 --> 02:38:20.289]  FCC studies market power of Radio Giant.
[02:38:20.609 --> 02:38:22.390]  GPS implant makes debut.
[02:38:23.071 --> 02:38:26.093]  Company field test prototype used to track movements in human host.
[02:38:26.573 --> 02:38:29.135]  That's coming up in the final segment here in one minute.
[02:38:30.856 --> 02:38:37.561]  Before I go any further, though, today, a couple of different items, and I will come back and do Pure News.

[02:40:21.666 --> 02:40:23.547]  Two hours and 37 minutes.

[02:40:24.788 --> 02:40:26.088]  Totally jam-packed.
[02:40:26.768 --> 02:40:33.651]  You want an overview, the most detailed thing I've done on government-sponsored terrorism, the legislation, how to stop them, their master plan.

[02:41:32.237 --> 02:41:32.678]  Stay with me.
[02:41:37.034 --> 02:41:39.975]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:41:40.655 --> 02:41:41.935]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:41:42.135 --> 02:41:47.877]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:41:48.137 --> 02:41:53.398]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem, reaction, solution.
[02:41:53.698 --> 02:41:57.859]  Brace yourselves, as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:41:58.019 --> 02:42:01.800]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:42:02.060 --> 02:42:06.641]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:42:06.781 --> 02:42:13.025]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:42:13.085 --> 02:42:14.946]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:42:47.085 --> 02:42:54.711]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.951 --> 02:42:58.054]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.

[02:44:41.355 --> 02:44:42.897]  Alright, final segment.
[02:44:43.297 --> 02:44:44.298]  Blitzing into the news.
[02:44:44.478 --> 02:44:48.181]  FCC studies market power of a radio giant.
[02:44:48.201 --> 02:44:51.064]  The Federal Communications Commission is trying to devise rules.
[02:44:51.084 --> 02:44:52.105]  Yeah, right.
[02:44:52.505 --> 02:44:56.669]  The Fox is trying to devise rules to stop the weasel in the henhouse.
[02:44:56.709 --> 02:44:59.231]  He's made him the main security guard.
[02:45:01.303 --> 02:45:14.334]  The Federal Communications Commission is trying to devise rules aimed at breaking the old clear channel communications as on radio markets in some rural areas, Commissioner Catherine Abernathy said today, and of course Powell's over her.
[02:45:15.315 --> 02:45:21.520]  By the way, what Clear Channel does, I've talked to radio station owners, I've seen it in the news, they come into a town, sell spots for 30 cents a piece.
[02:45:23.064 --> 02:45:35.112]  Now, of course, people run like idiots and buy it from them, because they don't care, and then when they put the little guys out of business, and everybody worked with for years, and had local hosts and employed people, after they're done, you're going to pay $100 a piece.
[02:45:35.172 --> 02:45:36.273]  Hmm, how's that sound?
[02:45:37.393 --> 02:45:38.214]  But you don't care.
[02:45:38.274 --> 02:45:39.335]  You'll do it for a year.
[02:45:39.695 --> 02:45:44.938]  You'll make a little money, run your ads, and then you're going to pay $100 instead of $10 a spot like you were with the little station.
[02:45:46.239 --> 02:45:48.601]  Yeah, and they'll put them out of business, but that's okay.
[02:45:49.221 --> 02:45:50.462]  You'll shop at Walmart, too.
[02:45:53.030 --> 02:46:00.760]  Uh, continues, the five commissioners led by the chairman Michael K. Powell are trying to redefine radio markets as part of their June 2nd vote on media ownership.
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:04.284]  I love how they're giving them more power and saying they're going to stop them.
[02:46:04.324 --> 02:46:05.465]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:46:05.846 --> 02:46:11.353]  WorldNet Daily, GPS implant makes debut, company field test prototype, use to track movements of human host.
[02:46:11.913 --> 02:46:14.494]  We covered this yesterday, on that Daily Zone a few days later.
[02:46:14.514 --> 02:46:21.576]  Applied General Solutions, a technology development company, yesterday said it has created, successfully field-tested a prototype of GPS implantable in humans.
[02:46:21.996 --> 02:46:30.379]  North Korea gets stern warning, President Bush, that South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun vowed yesterday that they will not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea.
[02:46:30.699 --> 02:46:32.860]  And I guess, why did Rumsfeld help give them to them then?
[02:46:34.122 --> 02:46:38.827]  Uh, and it turns out the FBI and the government reports of terror crimes inflated in the first two months of the year.
[02:46:38.907 --> 02:46:42.450]  The Justice Department filed charges of 56 people, labeling them as terrorists.
[02:46:42.871 --> 02:46:45.013]  Turns out 41 of them had nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:46:45.053 --> 02:46:45.874]  They could care less.
[02:46:47.535 --> 02:46:50.218]  Uh, just a bunch of other amazing articles.
[02:46:50.238 --> 02:46:51.199]  Let me try to hit some of these.
[02:46:52.273 --> 02:46:53.314]  These are pretty important.
[02:46:53.994 --> 02:46:56.435]  Bodies of 18 immigrants found in truck in Texas.
[02:46:56.475 --> 02:47:00.377]  This is every day, folks, that you hear about some van around the country.
[02:47:00.477 --> 02:47:01.738]  Okay, let's be, let's not exaggerate.
[02:47:01.798 --> 02:47:13.324]  Every three or four days I see an article, and I know I'm missing a lot of them, but there's a van with ten people, you know, and there's a car with three people in a trunk, and one of them dies, and then every couple months you hear about some 18-wheeler with dead people in it.
[02:47:13.724 --> 02:47:17.046]  This is the most, they say, in recent memory, in the article,
[02:47:18.186 --> 02:47:18.667]  18 dead.
[02:47:19.067 --> 02:47:21.909]  They say probably over 100 because a bunch ran away when they opened it.
[02:47:22.329 --> 02:47:27.212]  They caught 62 that were still alive and a bunch dead.
[02:47:27.232 --> 02:47:27.932]  18 of them.
[02:47:27.952 --> 02:47:29.293]  Just how open is our border?
[02:47:29.593 --> 02:47:31.634]  And the government's saying give up our liberty for security.
[02:47:33.435 --> 02:47:37.437]  Don't forget NBC News reported local companies' employees died in Saudi bombing.
[02:47:37.497 --> 02:47:41.720]  Turns out it was a Carlisle Group organization and they got bombed.
[02:47:41.740 --> 02:47:43.280]  And it says the firm was covered for CIA.
[02:47:44.887 --> 02:47:49.891]  The Times learned this week, one-time owners of the Carlaw Group, the firm was a CIA cover.
[02:47:50.792 --> 02:47:51.652]  Very convenient.
[02:47:51.692 --> 02:47:53.714]  And 50 of the 70 employees were gone.
[02:47:54.695 --> 02:47:56.456]  And very, very convenient.
[02:47:57.597 --> 02:48:00.619]  Another article here, officials who failed to put hijackers on a watch list.
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:04.643]  This is New York Times, seven months after telling Congress he would do so.
[02:48:05.223 --> 02:48:08.566]  George J. Tennant, the director, who's ready for mafia movies.
[02:48:08.586 --> 02:48:13.049]  That guy could quit the CIA and go get a part on HBO's The Sopranos.
[02:48:13.089 --> 02:48:13.870]  And he is, whoa!
[02:48:14.788 --> 02:48:16.129]  I mean, just look at him!
[02:48:16.149 --> 02:48:16.770]  Just look!
[02:48:16.830 --> 02:48:20.934]  If I was a cop, I saw that guy walking down the street, I'd hit my life's probable cause!
[02:48:21.094 --> 02:48:24.938]  I mean, you know, you can judge a book by its cover, my goodness!
[02:48:25.979 --> 02:48:40.292]  On seven months after telling Congress he would do so, George J. Tennant, the Director of Central Intelligence, was yet to provide the names of agency officials responsible for one of the most bloating intelligence mistakes leading up to the attacks of September 11th, according to congressional and agency officials!
[02:48:41.192 --> 02:48:44.593]  Yeah, a lot of them were on the terror list and mysteriously got taken off.
[02:48:44.633 --> 02:48:46.013]  The story's a lot worse than they say.
[02:48:47.334 --> 02:48:48.734]  Man, that was a good show!
[02:48:49.034 --> 02:48:50.955]  Didn't cover all the news, but covered a lot of it.
[02:48:50.975 --> 02:48:52.675]  Had a couple great guests on.
[02:48:53.596 --> 02:48:54.676]  God bless you all.
[02:48:54.696 --> 02:49:01.858]  I'm going to be up in Kansas City Saturday at the Blue Ridge Expo Center speaking with Colonel Craig Roberts, John Stattmiller, Ralph Epperson and others.
[02:49:02.998 --> 02:49:04.039]  Be sure and join us.
[02:49:04.259 --> 02:49:06.099]  And I'll see you back tomorrow.
[02:49:06.119 --> 02:49:08.520]  I've got the Dennis Cuddy interview coming on.
[02:49:09.375 --> 02:49:18.122]  By now you've all heard about prostate wellness from OneSource Health Products, the natural product to help men maintain and improve their prostate health.
[02:49:18.162 --> 02:49:20.604]  Did you know each year over 400,000 men in the United States alone undergo
