[00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:07.536]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.025 --> 00:00:15.686]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:17.468]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:19.250]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:20.712]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.752 --> 00:00:22.214]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:26.650]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.293]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:39.740]  Live from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:41.729]  Right here in Austin.
[00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:43.530]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.871]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial on a growing list of wonderful affiliates.
[00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:57.814]  Stumblecasting at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com on Global Shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20 from 11 to 2 Central and back from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:00:57.854 --> 00:00:59.715]  Welcome to the World Wide Broadcast today.
[00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:01.035]  We have Larry Pratt.
[00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:25.635]  Founder and President of Gun Owners of America joining us in the second hour to give us a legislative update to talk about Bush wanting to reauthorize the Clinton assault weapons ban and add a bunch of new gun bans to it, including a ban on all semi-automatic shotguns.
[00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:28.656]  It's all part of the new conservatism.
[00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:48.120]  Also, he'll be talking about the rebellion in Canada as many of the provinces refuse to confiscate and register guns, standing up to the federal government, and how gun owners of America is calling for a second amendment to be built into the Constitution for the Iraqi people.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.083]  Of course, they already had a right to keep and bear arms there under Saddam, but now they don't.
[00:01:53.123 --> 00:01:58.147]  They've been ordered to turn them all in, and they're refusing almost 100% of them.
[00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:03.594]  And the globalists are very, very angry about that.
[00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:07.437]  Coming up, alert issued as U.S.
[00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:09.158]  monkeypox cases grow to 37.
[00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.664]  Looks like the prairie dogs came from a breeder in Texas, where I'm sitting.
[00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:17.445]  We'll get into that.
[00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:28.823]  British scientist puts odds for apocalypse at 50-50 and is more worried about biological or chemical attack of some type.
[00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:29.965]  That is coming up.
[00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:31.336]  U.S.
[00:02:31.557 --> 00:02:38.821]  rates chances of al-Qaeda weapons of mass destruction attack very high in the next two years.
[00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:39.802]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:49.769]  They've got to get more legislation passed and set up more checkpoints and federalize our communities and set up a national draft and have a pretext to invade all these countries.
[00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:56.293]  The globalists told us they would provide terror, Pearl Harbor events, to get us behind this takeover.
[00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:10.821]  Last year I saw a Houston Chronicle article about a company that wants the government to make it the law to put a retina scanner in your car before it will start
[00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:15.158]  And a lot of companies are already installing it.
[00:03:15.198 --> 00:03:17.659]  It's like Void Comp from Blade Runner.
[00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.981]  It decides if you're tired or lying or on drugs.
[00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:23.162]  And now we have an article here.
[00:03:23.242 --> 00:03:28.424]  Drivers' eye movements measured to test tiredness by police.
[00:03:28.504 --> 00:03:30.685]  They're already out doing it now.
[00:03:31.406 --> 00:03:36.168]  And putting thumb scanners in the police cars paid for by the federal government.
[00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:54.660]  Speaking of Walmart pushing biometrics and pushing the RFID technology, making all the manufacturers adopted if Walmart is to carry their products, this is from CNET News, Richard Shim, Walmart to throw its weight behind RFID.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.644]  Now, I talked about those secret Walmart documents, and I'm going to cover more of those today.
[00:03:59.684 --> 00:04:02.926]  We will be posting them on InfoWars.com.
[00:04:02.946 --> 00:04:03.907]  We've just been so busy.
[00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:18.009]  But they will be going up and how they're involved with the federal government in developing and implementing this system, tiny microchips in all the products, woven into your clothes, being tracked by radio readers on the highways.
[00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:26.213]  And yesterday I read that article out of San Francisco where they're now making you take them in your car to track you and tax you around the city.
[00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:33.577]  Also, they want a brain scanner, stress test, biometric system for all the airports, not just Boston-Logan.
[00:04:34.787 --> 00:04:35.608]  That's coming up.
[00:04:35.768 --> 00:04:41.896]  Health chief pleads with parents to continue to take the vaccines despite all the deaths and illnesses in the United Kingdom.
[00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:43.117]  This is out of the London Telegraph.
[00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:43.818]  That's coming up.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.746]  And a lot of news on the Iraq war as the true motives come out in the mainstream news.
[00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:53.130]  Big show for you today!
[00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:56.630]  So please stay with us.
[00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.694]  And I do want to take calls early in this first hour, so go ahead and line up.
[00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:01.475]  I'd love to hear from you.
[00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:01.555]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:05:01.575 --> 00:05:02.476]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:10.316 --> 00:05:14.642]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:14.842 --> 00:05:19.268]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:23.794]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:23.835 --> 00:05:25.176]  The New World Order.
[00:05:25.937 --> 00:05:26.938]  Can emerge.
[00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:31.183]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:31.243 --> 00:05:38.191]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:40.314]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:51.139]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:56.702]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:05:57.182 --> 00:05:59.243]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:59.343 --> 00:06:00.003]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:00.264]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.284 --> 00:06:02.265]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:09.668 --> 00:06:17.932]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:06:18.192 --> 00:06:22.533]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:06:22.834 --> 00:06:31.757]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:06:31.957 --> 00:06:35.579]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:40.924]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:41.184 --> 00:06:47.951]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:48.792]  What about you?
[00:06:49.631 --> 00:06:50.632]  We're good to go.
[00:07:13.507 --> 00:07:15.389]  Imagine a live body on every call.
[00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:18.371]  Take the guesswork out of accidental calls to people on state or federal do-not-call lists.
[00:07:33.243 --> 00:07:34.384]  Call GTI Technologies toll free today at 877-518-5888.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.621]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:51.661 --> 00:07:52.681]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.784]  Welcome back to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:24.546]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.606 --> 00:08:26.648]  It's already Tuesday, the 10th of June, 2003.
[00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:36.442]  We'll be taking your calls on all the different news items I'm going to mention and analyze and of course any other news pieces that we don't cover that you'd like to mention.
[00:08:37.123 --> 00:08:43.067]  Any particular piece of legislation or something you saw a talking head, a CFR member say on the nightly news?
[00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:44.688]  We'd love to hear from you today.
[00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:50.071]  1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231 Larry Pratt is coming on to give us an overview of what's happening with the Second Amendment right now.
[00:08:58.346 --> 00:09:08.913]  And it's not in good shape in this country, but they are standing up for their God-given right of self-defense in Canada and other areas, so you don't want to miss that in the next hour.
[00:09:10.814 --> 00:09:12.735]  This monkeypox, isn't it interesting?
[00:09:12.795 --> 00:09:18.519]  Suddenly we have monkeypox, we have West Nile, we have SARS, all of this strengthening the...
[00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:35.519]  The governmental health community, the public health system, which is run by a bunch of eugenics control freaks, euthanasia-promoting people that say that, well, they need martial law-like powers to keep us safe.
[00:09:35.939 --> 00:09:44.084]  And then all of these primers in the psychology of epidemics are now conveniently showing up.
[00:09:44.144 --> 00:09:45.064]  Could it be coincidence?
[00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:46.165]  Well, it probably is.
[00:09:46.883 --> 00:09:48.765]  Plus, our borders are more open than ever.
[00:09:48.805 --> 00:09:55.252]  We're importing more stuff from the third world and faraway places alien to our biosphere.
[00:09:55.272 --> 00:09:57.014]  So you're going to see more and more of this happen.
[00:09:57.415 --> 00:10:03.561]  But they are going to be there capitalizing on it, fear-mongering on it, like they've done with the SARS, West Nile, and other things.
[00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:06.845]  But in the case of West Nile, that was given to Saddam Hussein.
[00:10:07.515 --> 00:10:15.381]  In the case of Lyme disease, it's been conclusively linked to Plum Island Bioweapons Lab, Level 3 Bioweapons Lab off the coast of New York.
[00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:27.229]  Deer have swum the mile into shore with the ticks, with the bioweapon in them, and now thousands of Americans die a year, tens of thousands become ill from Lyme disease.
[00:10:27.249 --> 00:10:33.233]  So we have many examples that we can confirm of this, but I don't know what's going on with monkeypox and the rest of it.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:41.224]  Alert issued is Mad Cow also has shown up in Canada and now in herds in the U.S.
[00:10:41.344 --> 00:10:43.845]  We will get to that news story as well.
[00:10:44.706 --> 00:10:55.832]  But as soon as it came out in the Billings Gazette last week that some of the herds that were infected with Mad Cow had shown up in Montana and other areas, the story suddenly disappeared.
[00:10:56.914 --> 00:11:00.897]  But getting back into the latest alert, alert issued as U.S.
[00:11:00.977 --> 00:11:03.638]  monkeypox cases grow to 37.
[00:11:03.738 --> 00:11:06.020]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:21.170]  Officials in three states tried on Monday to track down the prairie dogs believed spreading a monkeypox, a smallpox-like illness not seen before in the Western Hemisphere that may have infected 37 people.
[00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:26.253]  So they just know about 10 that have it, and now there's a bunch of people being tested.
[00:11:27.344 --> 00:11:47.015]  Bill Moberly, co-owner of the Pet Store in Chicago suburbs where some of the infected prairie dogs were believed to have become infected, said Monday he had bought the infected rats in question that then infected the prairie dogs from a breeder in Texas without knowing they were ill.
[00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:51.155]  So now there's this big search for the prairie dogs.
[00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:59.764]  Indiana officials say they're trying to track down 31 individuals or businesses believed to have purchased prairie dogs from his store since April 15.
[00:12:00.144 --> 00:12:02.587]  Similar efforts were underway in the other two states.
[00:12:03.499 --> 00:12:08.022]  I wonder why they don't mention where the guy bought it in Texas so we can all investigate.
[00:12:08.563 --> 00:12:20.792]  Mark Wagner, a communicable disease expert from the Wisconsin Division of Public Health, said the disease is most likely being spread when people are scratched or bitten while handling prairie dogs.
[00:12:21.912 --> 00:12:23.554]  Why are people buying prairie dogs?
[00:12:23.594 --> 00:12:26.016]  I guess for small zoos or animal centers?
[00:12:26.416 --> 00:12:26.876]  I don't know.
[00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:34.062]  Smallpox has been eradicated worldwide and children born after 1980 have not been immunized against it.
[00:12:34.382 --> 00:12:45.011]  Smallpox vaccinations, however, offer protection against monkeypox and it goes on and on for adults who were vaccinated earlier and most likely have an immunity against it.
[00:12:45.552 --> 00:12:47.053]  Now, they always said that
[00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:48.471]  Well, 99 plus percent.
[00:13:04.099 --> 00:13:05.321]  We're good to go.
[00:13:05.341 --> 00:13:06.001]  We're good to go.
[00:13:20.043 --> 00:13:21.344]  One in 1,000 has a heart attack.
[00:13:21.784 --> 00:13:24.325]  One in 1,500 dies statistically.
[00:13:24.685 --> 00:13:27.946]  That takes the smallpox shot, so the new smallpox shot.
[00:13:28.306 --> 00:13:30.227]  But they say children, however, are at risk.
[00:13:30.787 --> 00:13:35.829]  In Africa, the mortality rate for young children can be a high percentile.
[00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:43.012]  I can't stand it when I hit print on the printer-friendly version and it cuts part of it off.
[00:13:43.112 --> 00:13:44.473]  I don't know what the percent is.
[00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:46.133]  I'll have to go reprint this article.
[00:13:46.394 --> 00:13:47.514]  The percent got cut off.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.902]  So I'll go reprint this Washington Post article and find out what the percent is.
[00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.424]  I remember reading it this morning.
[00:13:56.444 --> 00:13:58.204]  I think it's like 20% or something.
[00:13:58.224 --> 00:13:59.045]  But I'm going from memory.
[00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:01.246]  Let me go reprint the Washington Post article.
[00:14:02.306 --> 00:14:06.368]  British scientist puts odds for apocalypse at 50-50.
[00:14:06.928 --> 00:14:08.929]  That's right.
[00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:10.009]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.211]  This is the way the world might end.
[00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:16.012]  A genetically engineered pathogen is released.
[00:14:16.917 --> 00:14:31.280]  Disturbing, disrupting, and it says that a supervolcano blocks out the sun or scientists in the biggest bioterror of them all accidentally trigger a big bang.
[00:14:32.221 --> 00:14:36.481]  Or bio-error of them all accidentally trigger a big bang.
[00:14:36.622 --> 00:14:39.642]  I'll get into this article later when I have a printer-friendly version.
[00:14:39.842 --> 00:14:41.143]  These are all printed incorrectly.
[00:14:41.543 --> 00:14:43.003]  I'll have to go back and reprint them.
[00:14:44.048 --> 00:14:48.210]  It's kind of hard to read something when the last word is cut off.
[00:14:48.711 --> 00:14:49.911]  But that's an interesting article.
[00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.413]  I'll be getting into that one.
[00:14:52.913 --> 00:15:08.022]  Because I agree with the analysis of the scientists because they have these nuclear accelerators and they're just randomly shooting different types of particles at high speeds
[00:15:09.331 --> 00:15:16.897]  Out of the accelerators and then shooting them into lead, shooting them into uranium, shooting them into plutonium, shooting them into nickel.
[00:15:17.457 --> 00:15:21.661]  And there's all these bizarre reactions when they do this.
[00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:36.712]  And many scientists have warned that they shouldn't do these tests without knowing the results, at least doing mathematical studies, because it can cause some type of giant supernova-type explosion.
[00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:43.403]  They don't understand how matter works at the subatomic level.
[00:15:44.003 --> 00:15:49.886]  There's whole areas that are not even understood, that haven't even been charted, that haven't even been discovered.
[00:15:50.643 --> 00:16:05.355]  And so they've got these big, giant, superconducting supercolliders accelerating atoms and different particle beams and different types of accelerated matter, slamming them into different substances.
[00:16:05.776 --> 00:16:14.903]  That could cause a giant explosion and turn the Earth into a molten slag heap or totally incinerate it, perhaps destroy our entire solar system.
[00:16:15.324 --> 00:16:17.766]  They say the explosion could be that large or even bigger.
[00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:21.070]  We could even destroy our own sun.
[00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:32.839]  They're worried about some of the new seismic weapons that have been mentioned in some of the official bills in Congress that could cause earthquakes.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:40.445]  A massive naturally occurring volcano could explode and shoot dust in the air and cause a new ice age.
[00:16:41.587 --> 00:16:42.848]  But that would probably happen.
[00:16:43.288 --> 00:16:50.114]  That's such a large scheme, a large time scale, that there's no telling when that will really develop, if ever.
[00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:51.656]  But we know it's developed in the past.
[00:16:52.997 --> 00:17:06.828]  And then the really dangerous thing, the thing that I think is the greatest threat, and they mention a bunch of other things in this article that we'll get into later in the next segment, is genetic-engineered pathogens getting turned loose.
[00:17:07.169 --> 00:17:10.772]  And we know that porting down bioweapons lab...
[00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:29.871]  Over in the United Kingdom in Wiltshire, produces and has level 4 status and is underground and has three rings of barbed wire around it and minefields, but that didn't stop four years ago from someone releasing weaponized foot and mouth.
[00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:35.885]  Of course, two months before it showed up in over a dozen locations simultaneously.
[00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:37.846]  That's not how natural outbreaks behave.
[00:17:37.866 --> 00:17:44.188]  They don't show up in Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland in the same week by accident.
[00:17:45.628 --> 00:17:49.510]  But to go back, the Porton Down Bioweapons Lab had contacted...
[00:17:50.679 --> 00:17:57.743]  The different counties in the United Kingdom and told them, prepare masses of pyre, prepare masses of wood.
[00:17:57.763 --> 00:17:59.644]  They don't have a lot of woods in England.
[00:17:59.664 --> 00:18:02.165]  I remember it was a very expensive undertaking, the article said.
[00:18:02.565 --> 00:18:04.386]  They massed all these pyres.
[00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:08.348]  They said, prepare for some type of large outbreak, perhaps foot and mouth.
[00:18:08.888 --> 00:18:19.594]  Then suddenly foot and mouth showed up and Porton Downs said, we think an animal rights activist stole this out of our lab and it got released.
[00:18:19.714 --> 00:18:19.854]  Well,
[00:18:20.916 --> 00:18:23.938]  Okay, let's buy their story that an animal rights activist stole it.
[00:18:23.998 --> 00:18:38.285]  How did an animal rights activist get into an underground base guarded by the Army, guarded by MI5 and Army intelligence, and then how did this person simultaneously get it spread to the four corners of the United Kingdom?
[00:18:39.686 --> 00:18:42.067]  And so it's just as bad either way.
[00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:44.849]  If their security is so lax, you can walk in and steal this stuff.
[00:18:46.027 --> 00:18:48.932]  But again, I don't buy that because the government had the motive.
[00:18:48.992 --> 00:18:53.459]  The farmers were against the EU fighting it, becoming a powerful political bloc.
[00:18:53.819 --> 00:18:55.883]  They were about to get gun laws reversed.
[00:18:55.923 --> 00:18:57.826]  They were about to defeat the hunting bans.
[00:18:59.207 --> 00:19:02.649]  They were the really active, intelligent, on-target group.
[00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:09.552]  And then I predicted that after they killed 8 million sheep and 4 million cows, they would not allow them to restock the cows and sheep.
[00:19:09.972 --> 00:19:16.535]  And then the big environmental minister announced that cows were causing problems with their runoff and their flatulence was hurting the ozone.
[00:19:17.315 --> 00:19:27.800]  And so they were going to ban them restocking their cows and sheep and have basically done that and forced the sale of these ancient farms and destroyed these indigenous communities.
[00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:40.471]  So it's ethnic cleansing, basically, of the rural communities in England, and they're using immigration to continue that, destroying the British Isles and the incredible culture that was there.
[00:19:42.165 --> 00:19:45.546]  So, you... But, see, I didn't give you the big part of the story.
[00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:53.729]  I've read articles where they admit Horton Down, James Weapons Publications has written about it, Horton Down, this is one lab of hundreds that we know of.
[00:19:53.829 --> 00:19:56.930]  There's thousands probably out there that are secret, but hundreds that we know of.
[00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.431]  Well, I'll tell you what they say they produce there.
[00:20:01.072 --> 00:20:03.433]  It's not just weaponized foot and mouth, okay?
[00:20:03.853 --> 00:20:07.494]  They produce stuff that will kill... Well, I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[00:20:10.598 --> 00:20:19.204]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:19.424 --> 00:20:30.712]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:30.912 --> 00:20:33.574]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:33.914 --> 00:20:38.017]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:40.358]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:40.518 --> 00:20:42.400]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:48.623]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:48.863 --> 00:20:54.547]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:20:54.867 --> 00:20:58.792]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:21:10.675 --> 00:21:14.959]  Every cell of the body has a receptor site for our master hormone called growth hormone.
[00:21:15.379 --> 00:21:18.462]  The role of growth hormone is to instruct the cells to repair.
[00:21:18.842 --> 00:21:23.867]  This hormone is in the highest concentrations in the body between the ages of infancy and your early twenties.
[00:21:24.287 --> 00:21:27.690]  Hence, this is the major reason why the body repairs so well when young.
[00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.931]  We're good to go.
[00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:47.431]  Keep sleep.
[00:21:47.691 --> 00:21:49.513]  Improve mood, memory, and energy.
[00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:50.994]  Losses of body fat.
[00:21:51.335 --> 00:21:53.056]  Improve strength and sex drive.
[00:21:53.537 --> 00:21:54.718]  Reduction of joint pains.
[00:21:54.998 --> 00:21:55.899]  Improve blood sugar.
[00:21:56.179 --> 00:21:56.620]  And more.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.882]  Improve your chemistry and improve your life.

[00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:10.853]  We're good to go.
[00:22:33.482 --> 00:22:35.404]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:23:01.645 --> 00:23:04.227]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:05.548 --> 00:23:07.309]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:10.151 --> 00:23:16.034]  Some people believe a group of wealthy men control political parties, the American media, and the wealth of our nation.
[00:23:16.455 --> 00:23:17.175]  Is this true?
[00:23:17.715 --> 00:23:22.639]  Dr. Stanley Monteith spent 40 years studying secret societies and subversive movements.
[00:23:22.999 --> 00:23:28.783]  He lived in Africa for three years, and when he returned home, he studied the writings of the men who shaped the modern world.
[00:23:29.203 --> 00:23:30.944]  His book, Brotherhood of Darkness,
[00:23:31.164 --> 00:23:34.867]  Identify as the people who control the world and the organizations they created.
[00:23:35.128 --> 00:23:42.714]  Dr. Monteith exposes the movement behind Rhodes Scholarship, the origin of the Council on Foreign Relations, and the myths surrounding communism.
[00:23:43.035 --> 00:23:45.657]  He discusses the goal of all covert organizations.
[00:23:45.937 --> 00:23:50.741]  So if you read Brotherhood of Darkness, you will learn a secret that has been passed down through the centuries.
[00:23:50.941 --> 00:23:56.867]  When you learn this secret, you will understand what the future holds and what you must do to help preserve our nation.
[00:23:57.427 --> 00:23:57.507]  Only $12.95.
[00:23:57.547 --> 00:23:57.808]  That's 877-300-7695.
[00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:29.738]  Folks, I'm not trying to spew gloom and doom here.
[00:24:31.019 --> 00:24:41.125]  Jane's Weapons Publications out of England, the world leader in tracking military technology, hardly ever puts out alerts.
[00:24:41.165 --> 00:24:45.568]  They may put out one a year, and just a few months ago they put out an alert about...
[00:24:46.437 --> 00:25:01.668]  Race-specific viruses and bacteria, race-specific pathogens, and they said the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Israel have been known to develop race-specific bioweapons, and that's what they're producing at Porton Down.
[00:25:01.708 --> 00:25:04.450]  About four years ago, Porton Down was bragging.
[00:25:05.242 --> 00:25:09.784]  That they had race-specific viruses and bacteria that would wipe out whole races of people.
[00:25:10.264 --> 00:25:13.786]  That they have systems that will kill every person on Earth.
[00:25:13.926 --> 00:25:15.386]  Now, that was quite a claim.
[00:25:15.787 --> 00:25:27.692]  Maybe they've got some super pathogens, but generally even the worst diseases will only kill 50-60% of the people that come in contact with it.
[00:25:28.712 --> 00:25:34.595]  But they claim they've got stuff that will kill every one of an entire race or human beings, period.
[00:25:35.936 --> 00:25:41.198]  And Jane's Weapons came out and put out an alert and said, this is horrible, this is very dangerous.
[00:25:41.278 --> 00:25:50.440]  But no one connected the dots that somebody walked out of Porton Down with weaponized foot and mouth from that Level 4 bioweapons lab.
[00:25:51.741 --> 00:25:58.123]  By the way, in the middle of 2002, a subsidiary of the Carlyle Group bought Porton Down.
[00:25:58.183 --> 00:26:02.644]  They privatized it and many other bioweapons labs in the United Kingdom.
[00:26:03.601 --> 00:26:13.588]  And there's also a Reuters story that came out right after 9-1-1 that Bin Laden owned the majority of the stock of a bioweapons private company that does contracting for the U.S.
[00:26:13.628 --> 00:26:15.669]  government up in Connecticut.
[00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:23.435]  So it just gets crazier and crazier and crazier with the Carlaw Group and others buying into bioweapons labs.
[00:26:25.513 --> 00:26:25.893]  We're good to go.
[00:26:54.731 --> 00:27:01.073]  So, when the scientist says that he thinks that the odds of the apocalypse are 50-50, I tend to agree.
[00:27:01.933 --> 00:27:04.073]  They call this a .1 civilization.
[00:27:04.614 --> 00:27:06.854]  Will we become a .1 civilization?
[00:27:07.254 --> 00:27:08.494]  We're not even a .1 yet.
[00:27:08.614 --> 00:27:18.557]  Will we get to the point of surviving, getting past these psychopaths, past the point of having the technologies to kill ourselves and it being uncontrolled?
[00:27:19.204 --> 00:27:28.147]  And the globalists say that they want world government to be able to control all this as they hand these systems out as a way to create crises.
[00:27:29.488 --> 00:27:44.834]  So the British government either accidentally let somebody steal foot and mouth, but they just so happened to, again, months before, call the different agriculture departments of the counties and tell them to get pyres ready to burn the dead animals, and then it showed up.
[00:27:45.689 --> 00:27:47.550]  But, okay, let's buy their story.
[00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:49.692]  Of course, no one was ever prosecuted or caught.
[00:27:50.112 --> 00:27:55.696]  They claim that they, quote, think an animal rights activist stole foot and mouth.
[00:27:55.716 --> 00:27:58.537]  An animal rights activist stole foot and mouth and released it.
[00:27:58.618 --> 00:28:02.280]  Okay, well then how are people waltzing in and getting this from your bioweapons lab?
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.881]  Either way, it's horrible.
[00:28:05.182 --> 00:28:07.563]  British scientist puts odds for apocalypse at 50-50.
[00:28:09.003 --> 00:28:11.264]  Reuters, this is the way the world might end.
[00:28:11.284 --> 00:28:13.826]  A genetically engineered pathogen is released.
[00:28:13.846 --> 00:28:17.767]  Debris from an erupting super volcano blocks the sun.
[00:28:18.828 --> 00:28:26.652]  Or scientists in the biggest bio-error of them all accidentally trigger a matter-squeezing Big Bang.
[00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:43.596]  The demise of civilization has been predicted since it began, but the odds of keeping planet Earth alive and well are getting worse amid a breakneck pace of scientific advances, according to Martin Rees, Britain's honorary astronomer royale.
[00:28:44.337 --> 00:28:52.381]  Rees, it says, calculates the odds of an apocalypse disaster striking Earth have risen to about 50% from 20% 100 years ago.
[00:28:55.043 --> 00:29:05.834]  The 60-year-old scientist, author of the recently published Our Final Hours, says science is advancing in a far more unpredictable and potentially dangerous pattern than ever before.
[00:29:06.315 --> 00:29:15.504]  He lists as mankind's biggest threats nuclear terrorism, deadly engineered viruses, rogue machines, a genetic engineering that could alter human character.
[00:29:15.964 --> 00:29:18.287]  All of those could result from an innocent error
[00:29:19.133 --> 00:29:20.013]  I will come back and talk to...
[00:29:42.387 --> 00:29:50.852]  Helda and others, if you would like to join us on air, it is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:50.892 --> 00:29:53.053]  This is what I've been talking about.
[00:29:53.414 --> 00:29:54.614]  This is what I'm worried about.
[00:29:55.135 --> 00:29:59.017]  And the globalists are pushing all of this in an uncontrolled fashion.
[00:30:00.738 --> 00:30:01.678]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.119 --> 00:30:03.760]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.362]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:11.151]  Are you prepared?
[00:30:11.331 --> 00:30:13.732]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[00:30:13.952 --> 00:30:18.375]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[00:30:18.695 --> 00:30:24.579]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our egg- So call toll-free 800-510-4074 or visit www.robertbarefoot.com.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.261]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:30:38.741 --> 00:30:41.942]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:53.847 --> 00:30:58.229]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central and back from 9 to midnight.
[00:30:58.769 --> 00:31:00.149]  Thanks for tuning into the show.
[00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.051]  We're updating InfoWars.com.
[00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.592]  Right now, we're going to be posting this Reuters story.
[00:31:07.652 --> 00:31:11.355]  British scientist puts odds for apocalypse at 50-50.
[00:31:12.175 --> 00:31:20.902]  And the biggest threat I see isn't the superconducting supercolliders where they accelerate matter into lead, uranium, plutonium, and other metals.
[00:31:21.182 --> 00:31:32.630]  And a lot of top scientists, quantum mechanic physicists, and others say that this could cause a supernova or a huge nuclear explosion or hydrogen explosion.
[00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:35.900]  I don't see that as the biggest threat.
[00:31:36.441 --> 00:31:45.269]  I see the bio-threat that he does mention in here as the biggest threat, and he believes millions will die by 2020 from a bio-release.
[00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:53.537]  And imagine out of that bio-release, or a biological weapon, a massive re-engineering of society into a brave new world type system.
[00:31:53.898 --> 00:31:57.241]  And they are building that prison right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:58.916 --> 00:31:59.196]  Imagine.
[00:31:59.216 --> 00:31:59.496]  Imagine.
[00:32:28.758 --> 00:32:36.503]  And if they get us herded into the compact cities, if they succeed in building the biometric casual society grid, it is the globalist plan to release these systems.
[00:32:36.523 --> 00:32:38.264]  I'm about to go to your calls.
[00:32:38.284 --> 00:32:39.825]  I want to make one more point about this.
[00:32:40.546 --> 00:32:48.571]  When you get up into higher-level globalist publications that are public, that are policy white papers written for their different minion systems...
[00:32:49.847 --> 00:33:08.918]  DARPA and the Pentagon and the CIA and all the social architects are told, the mid-level people, we're carrying out and setting up this police state because we can't afford to let a rogue third world nation develop these super bioweapons, these super chemical weapons, these super nuclear weapons.
[00:33:10.419 --> 00:33:17.943]  We've got to have a global government to clamp down and control these countries and to suppress and keep these technologies classified.
[00:33:19.386 --> 00:33:36.919]  But they say the end justifies the means, so they are proliferating some of the older weapons, anthrax, botulism, smallpox, a lot of the evidence shows, West Nile nuclear systems, chemical systems, to the third world.
[00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:43.844]  Our government, the global government, always arms them to then say they have the pretext to invade those countries.
[00:33:44.853 --> 00:33:45.273]  We're good to go.
[00:33:51.610 --> 00:34:02.379]  And they are pushing eugenics under the title bioethics, but the Journal of Bioethics is really a eugenics manual, a eugenics journal, and they're promoting euthanasia and abortion, and you have this culture of death.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.242]  It is the globalists that have said they will release this.
[00:34:05.702 --> 00:34:15.711]  It is their dream to release this once they have cures for systems they plan to release to get rid of large masses of us down to a 500 to 450 million manageable level.
[00:34:18.733 --> 00:34:29.680]  These are public statements on the record, mainstream news, in my film, Descent into Tyranny, in the book, Descent into Tyranny, in the film, Road to Tyranny, and it's public, it's out there.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.661]  Yes, it's horrible.
[00:34:30.761 --> 00:34:31.621]  Yes, it's bizarre.
[00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:32.722]  But they're saying it.
[00:34:32.782 --> 00:34:33.382]  They're doing it.
[00:34:34.523 --> 00:34:46.771]  By the way, this scientist and many others mention the fact that, and he's the big head of the Royal Society, the Royal Astronomer in England, which is the top honor, the creme de la creme,
[00:34:47.893 --> 00:34:48.374]  We're good to go.
[00:35:06.178 --> 00:35:13.701]  And I just want to tell you, the technology you see is 25 years to 35 years, in some cases 100 years old.
[00:35:14.161 --> 00:35:15.981]  They have been suppressing technology.
[00:35:16.121 --> 00:35:17.442]  It is a fact.
[00:35:17.862 --> 00:35:21.143]  The problem is the globalists have funded talk show hosts.
[00:35:21.763 --> 00:35:38.273]  On purpose and shows like the X-Files that mix real suppressed technology and real information with flying saucers and aliens, thus that discredits the entire field, who are people, when they hear someone discuss suppressed technologies, go, what are you talking about?
[00:35:38.313 --> 00:35:45.897]  But I will point out that Jane's Weapons Publications did report on the B-2 bomber four years before it was rolled out in 1987.
[00:35:46.418 --> 00:35:48.779]  So there's a lot of stuff that is suppressed.
[00:35:49.931 --> 00:36:09.997]  Super laser and directed energy particle beam weapons, seismic weapons, super chemical and biological weapons, space planes, just all different types of weapons, mind control weapons that are patented in the 50s, you name it.
[00:36:10.037 --> 00:36:11.198]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[00:36:11.238 --> 00:36:12.098]  What do you think about this?
[00:36:13.318 --> 00:36:15.439]  Is it HELDA or HELGA in Texas?
[00:36:16.756 --> 00:36:17.396]  It's Helga.
[00:36:18.077 --> 00:36:21.038]  Helga, you've got a bad phone, so go ahead and make your points.
[00:36:22.298 --> 00:36:45.167]  Right now, we have a chance, because right now, Bush and the rest of them are discredited, to get the politicians involved, to get the Bill of Rights, to say that we cannot, because of all the lies and we cannot trust to have our
[00:36:46.095 --> 00:36:47.896]  Constitution.
[00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:54.441]  Ma'am, I want to hear what you have to say, but are you on a cordless phone?
[00:36:55.061 --> 00:36:55.321]  No.
[00:36:57.282 --> 00:36:57.963]  Can you hear me now?
[00:36:58.689 --> 00:36:59.870]  You're not on a cordless phone.
[00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.811]  No, maybe I have a bad phone.
[00:37:01.931 --> 00:37:03.272]  You probably got water in your lines.
[00:37:03.292 --> 00:37:05.894]  It's been raining for two weeks straight here in Austin.
[00:37:05.934 --> 00:37:08.796]  Why don't you get... Okay, just... It's fine right there.
[00:37:08.856 --> 00:37:12.198]  Just talk... I don't have to go very long.
[00:37:12.638 --> 00:37:24.326]  But right now, before the spin doctors talk it away again, right now we have to get on every politician to get our Bill of Rights back and get the Patriot Act 1 and 2 out.
[00:37:26.574 --> 00:37:29.376]  Right now we have this opportunity.
[00:37:30.437 --> 00:37:34.259]  Before they come with the chaos and monkey parks and whatever else.
[00:37:34.939 --> 00:37:40.343]  Right now they are discredited and we have to take our opportunity.
[00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:44.027]  To get the politician on our side.
[00:37:44.087 --> 00:37:52.949]  So you're saying before the military-industrial complex launches more terror attacks and really clamps down, we've got to get the word out of what's really happening now?
[00:37:52.969 --> 00:38:01.411]  Right now, we have every single person has to do whatever he can and work on the politicians and work on each other.
[00:38:01.431 --> 00:38:02.911]  Well, here's a couple points, Helga.
[00:38:03.852 --> 00:38:06.275]  Why didn't Saddam use his weapons of mass destruction?
[00:38:06.315 --> 00:38:08.097]  That's the one thing you do when you're cornered.
[00:38:08.557 --> 00:38:09.258]  Where is he?
[00:38:09.398 --> 00:38:10.439]  Where is bin Laden?
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.423]  It's confirmed that a Russian jet took him out of the country with U.S.
[00:38:14.583 --> 00:38:16.646]  escorts into Russia.
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.361]  A bubble bath with Bin Laden, yeah.
[00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:21.262]  Yeah.
[00:38:21.282 --> 00:38:22.582]  They're all together in a hot tub.
[00:38:22.783 --> 00:38:23.063]  Right.
[00:38:23.523 --> 00:38:25.464]  And, well, we know Bin Laden is.
[00:38:25.544 --> 00:38:30.507]  So we've got all this happening, and we know they paid off the Republican Guard in gold.
[00:38:30.567 --> 00:38:36.691]  We have pushed on the rest of them discredited right now, including Blair.
[00:38:37.472 --> 00:38:40.514]  Right now, we have an opportunity to get...
[00:38:41.536 --> 00:38:47.378]  Patriot Act 1 and 2 also disqualified because we don't need it.
[00:38:47.878 --> 00:38:53.800]  We cannot trust what the government is telling us, and we cannot give our rights away right now.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.801]  That's the point.
[00:38:57.961 --> 00:39:02.003]  We cannot trust what they're telling us.
[00:39:02.023 --> 00:39:03.823]  This government is illegitimate.
[00:39:06.607 --> 00:39:08.088]  We know all this, yes.
[00:39:08.108 --> 00:39:17.693]  This is not the real... But right now, as long as the Bush and the rest of the, you know, gang, they are so untouchable.
[00:39:18.653 --> 00:39:19.393]  Untouchable.
[00:39:19.834 --> 00:39:21.114]  Now they are touchable.
[00:39:21.635 --> 00:39:33.801]  And right now, we can do... We have to, right now, get the Patriot Act 1 and 2 out of our lives or so weakened...
[00:39:35.023 --> 00:39:37.264]  We have, actually, we have to get it out of the way.
[00:39:37.344 --> 00:39:37.704]  All right.
[00:39:38.204 --> 00:39:39.624]  Good points, Helga.
[00:39:39.644 --> 00:39:41.405]  Thanks for the call, and I appreciate the call.
[00:39:42.225 --> 00:39:48.347]  Let me just make a few points on this, and I'll go to JQ and Mac and others that are patiently holding.
[00:39:50.207 --> 00:39:52.067]  We might boost my audio to the callers.
[00:39:52.087 --> 00:39:52.908]  I don't think they can hear me.
[00:39:54.228 --> 00:40:01.490]  Look, to talk about the lies, I mean, before the war even started,
[00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:12.397]  The National Security Council got caught making up a fake document that supposedly came from Niger, the African country, nuclear weapons parts to Saddam.
[00:40:13.238 --> 00:40:20.042]  And it turned out that it wasn't false intelligence, that it wasn't something that they accidentally misidentified, that they wrote it up.
[00:40:20.142 --> 00:40:20.843]  It was fake.
[00:40:22.624 --> 00:40:26.747]  We know that they had some weapons dossier that Powell read at the UN.
[00:40:27.268 --> 00:40:29.169]  Parts of it were written 12 years ago.
[00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.851]  Most of it was written 6 years ago.
[00:40:32.717 --> 00:40:33.797]  The thing was a lie.
[00:40:34.977 --> 00:40:40.158]  We know that they pressured the CIA to lie and talk about evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
[00:40:40.478 --> 00:40:44.839]  We know the satellite photos that Powell showed at the U.N.
[00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:47.400]  were nothing more than fakes.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:52.941]  They were images of a bakery, of an Islamic school that had a bakery complex.
[00:40:52.961 --> 00:40:55.601]  They let the BBC in.
[00:40:55.881 --> 00:40:58.862]  The day after he was in front of the U.N., there was nothing there but a bakery.
[00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.411]  We know that they've lied to us.
[00:41:02.471 --> 00:41:03.871]  We know they're a bunch of liars.
[00:41:04.071 --> 00:41:06.853]  We know that there are chemical weapons all over Iraq.
[00:41:07.153 --> 00:41:10.754]  And you're like, what do you mean there's chemical weapons all over Iraq?
[00:41:10.794 --> 00:41:12.435]  You just said that there weren't any.
[00:41:12.495 --> 00:41:15.997]  No, I said there weren't any weapons that hadn't really been discovered.
[00:41:16.797 --> 00:41:25.981]  And if you watch Hans Blix and Powell and the rest of them, you'll notice they talk about sites that they'd already been inspected, sites that had already been declared.
[00:41:27.162 --> 00:41:29.823]  There are hundreds of bombed out,
[00:41:30.555 --> 00:41:43.745]  Coxified craters where Saddam's 100-plus underground bunkers, many of them the size of football fields, giant underground complexes.
[00:41:44.065 --> 00:41:49.268]  We have them here with big crates of chemical weapons marked U.S.
[00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.849]  and Russian.
[00:41:49.949 --> 00:41:50.810]  We have the video.
[00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:52.671]  It's been on the news.
[00:41:54.052 --> 00:41:56.294]  Joyce Riley got foot of Jeb at 6, 7, 8 years ago.
[00:41:58.642 --> 00:41:59.922]  And this is the reality.
[00:42:00.162 --> 00:42:04.084]  So there are all these bombed out sites full of chemical weapons.
[00:42:05.364 --> 00:42:10.545]  Exploded and unexploded bunkers just caved in full of this stuff.
[00:42:10.645 --> 00:42:11.726]  And it leaks out.
[00:42:12.166 --> 00:42:13.306]  Our troops breathed it.
[00:42:13.986 --> 00:42:14.986]  And thousands died.
[00:42:15.027 --> 00:42:16.307]  Tens of thousands were ill.
[00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.027]  This is admitted now by the Pentagon.
[00:42:18.788 --> 00:42:21.208]  From Kamasia and other bunkers being blown up.
[00:42:21.968 --> 00:42:23.809]  Imagine what it was like for the Iraqis.
[00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:27.730]  No wonder a million and a half Iraqis have died since the end of the Gulf War.
[00:42:28.925 --> 00:42:35.549]  From chemicals getting into the water table and children around depleted uranium and all of this.
[00:42:36.009 --> 00:42:40.012]  If we've had thousands of troops die, the conservative number is 30,000.
[00:42:40.052 --> 00:42:43.434]  30,000 died since the Gulf War.
[00:42:43.794 --> 00:42:46.796]  The University of Texas at Dallas has done the brainstem studies.
[00:42:46.816 --> 00:42:48.017]  They were hit with chemical weapons.
[00:42:48.057 --> 00:42:50.318]  Yes, they breathed it from the bunkers being blown up.
[00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.772]  So they could find chemical weapons all day long.
[00:42:53.812 --> 00:42:55.653]  The problem is all the sites are declared.
[00:42:56.034 --> 00:42:57.595]  The UN has been in there.
[00:42:58.195 --> 00:42:59.536]  Our government has been in there.
[00:43:00.457 --> 00:43:05.461]  And they can't go and hold up a chemical warhead shell because it's marked US.
[00:43:07.523 --> 00:43:11.306]  And now it turns out that those mobile trucks were not biological trucks.
[00:43:11.646 --> 00:43:12.707]  That was totally made up.
[00:43:13.147 --> 00:43:15.790]  Just lie after lie after lie after lie.
[00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:18.432]  And again, why didn't Saddam use chemical weapons?
[00:43:19.389 --> 00:43:20.730]  Why didn't he use biological weapons?
[00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.351]  We were all told about that red line.
[00:43:22.871 --> 00:43:24.472]  If we crossed it, it was all over.
[00:43:26.013 --> 00:43:33.417]  Turns out the Republican Guard, before the war, had already been paid off in gold bars, euros, and dollars by SAS, British...
[00:43:34.053 --> 00:43:35.353]  Special Forces and U.S.
[00:43:35.393 --> 00:43:41.775]  Delta Force had already been paid off, and Saddam had been flown out, and the top Iraqi generals had already been flown out.
[00:43:42.175 --> 00:43:48.536]  They boarded twin-rotor helicopters, were flown out to jet bases, and flown out by our government.
[00:43:48.616 --> 00:43:48.957]  Okay?
[00:43:49.537 --> 00:43:50.477]  Let's talk to J.Q.
[00:43:50.517 --> 00:43:50.997]  in Oregon.
[00:43:51.037 --> 00:43:51.997]  J.Q., you're on the air.
[00:43:52.037 --> 00:43:52.417]  Go ahead.
[00:43:53.137 --> 00:43:54.038]  Well, howdy, Alex.
[00:43:54.158 --> 00:43:58.899]  I have three things, two comments and a question.
[00:43:59.059 --> 00:43:59.379]  First...
[00:43:59.966 --> 00:44:02.688]  A little clarification on this black hole thing.
[00:44:03.449 --> 00:44:11.695]  In nature, black holes can be formed, but it takes huge amounts of mass, several times the mass of our sun to create them.
[00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:16.579]  Hundreds of millions of suns running into each other will cause a super black hole.
[00:44:17.039 --> 00:44:21.002]  Dozens of suns in solar systems colliding could cause a smaller black hole.
[00:44:21.182 --> 00:44:23.204]  Now, the physicists have...
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:24.120]  Thank you.
[00:44:40.515 --> 00:44:41.755]  Tiny little black hole.
[00:44:41.795 --> 00:44:51.117]  Will it suck the laboratory machinery, the laboratory, the Earth into it, into, as, wow, in just an instant.
[00:44:51.137 --> 00:44:55.438]  The whole Earth could be turned into a, vanished from the universe, basically.
[00:44:55.718 --> 00:44:59.519]  Well, JQ, I'll keep you on, but let me comment on what you just said.
[00:44:59.779 --> 00:45:02.220]  For those that just joined us, it's a Reuters story.
[00:45:02.958 --> 00:45:13.671]  Top British scientists and others warned about these superconducting supercolliders, about these fission tests they're doing, creating little suns, trying to create little black holes.
[00:45:14.152 --> 00:45:22.262]  Yes, it'll grab mass around it, and it's a chain reaction, and a lot of scientists are saying that they need to stop this right now.
[00:45:23.936 --> 00:45:33.902]  Also, they've got these underground bases down half a mile that are trying to capture these different types of matter, and they're doing it successfully.
[00:45:33.982 --> 00:45:37.785]  Now they're going to accelerate those in superconducting super colliders.
[00:45:38.225 --> 00:45:41.287]  They're saying it's very, very dangerous and it could cause an apocalypse.
[00:45:41.687 --> 00:45:46.851]  But do you agree with me that it's more dangerous in the short term, all this genetic engineering they're doing?
[00:45:48.399 --> 00:45:50.340]  Well, hold on with that.
[00:45:51.241 --> 00:45:58.585]  The black hole thing could happen in an instant, and if you're far enough away from the Earth, it would just be a flash of light and we would be gone.
[00:45:59.466 --> 00:46:00.807]  Okay, item two.
[00:46:03.248 --> 00:46:06.991]  You mentioned a week ago, I guess, that you were a little frustrated.
[00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:12.334]  You were on a talk show with some military person who was supporting the New World Order.
[00:46:13.334 --> 00:46:17.437]  You can defeat him every time by just pointing out a couple of simple facts.
[00:46:18.311 --> 00:46:22.233]  And that's that Bush has pledged allegiance to a foreign power.
[00:46:22.253 --> 00:46:23.193]  He went to the UN.
[00:46:23.213 --> 00:46:25.254]  He's pledged allegiance to a foreign power.
[00:46:26.234 --> 00:46:30.796]  And if that soldier takes orders from Bush, he is not an American.
[00:46:31.016 --> 00:46:33.617]  He is a soldier of the foreign power.
[00:46:34.078 --> 00:46:36.919]  So he has no right to speak as an American.
[00:46:36.979 --> 00:46:38.419]  He is not an American soldier.
[00:46:38.799 --> 00:46:40.600]  He is a soldier of the United Nations.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.381]  This is the law.
[00:46:41.621 --> 00:46:47.223]  Michael New pointed that out, and Bush's father pledged us all to the sacred...
[00:46:48.018 --> 00:46:49.199]  Charter of the UN.
[00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:50.180]  I mean, what does that mean?
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.481]  Sacred UN?
[00:46:51.501 --> 00:46:56.024]  Well, right, the sacred principles of the United Nations is the words he used.
[00:46:56.985 --> 00:47:01.068]  Anyhow, this guy you were talking with is not an American soldier.
[00:47:01.088 --> 00:47:04.450]  He has no right to speak as an American, as a soldier.
[00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:10.955]  Well, I mean, I was on the show saying Bush is going to do the assault weapons ban, and they said, good, that's conservative.
[00:47:12.199 --> 00:47:16.482]  And then the individual piped up and said, by the way, I used to be a Democrat.
[00:47:17.122 --> 00:47:20.844]  It's real funny to them that they're the neocons, and they've taken over.
[00:47:20.864 --> 00:47:22.625]  Did you hear about that Toronto Star?
[00:47:23.226 --> 00:47:24.546]  Okay, now this is the third.
[00:47:24.626 --> 00:47:25.567]  This is the question.
[00:47:27.028 --> 00:47:31.490]  I've looked for that Trotsky and Whitehouse thing, and I haven't been able to find it.
[00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:32.591]  How do I find it?
[00:47:33.952 --> 00:47:35.213]  Funny, I was just mentioning that.
[00:47:35.233 --> 00:47:37.354]  It was actually in the National Post.
[00:47:38.308 --> 00:47:41.430]  And it's posted on InfoWars.com, or at least it should have been.
[00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.751]  I couldn't find it on InfoWars.
[00:47:44.072 --> 00:47:45.192]  Okay, well, let's see.
[00:47:45.272 --> 00:47:47.374]  I'm not a very good finder, maybe.
[00:47:47.394 --> 00:48:01.222]  Yeah, it's the National Post, and I read the article, and I had also Dr. Dennis Cuddy on talking about how the neocons were founded by the Fourth International, by the Trotskyites.
[00:48:01.843 --> 00:48:05.705]  Okay, I'll go to InfoWars and search for National Post.
[00:48:06.425 --> 00:48:07.345]  I'll tell you what I'll do.
[00:48:07.365 --> 00:48:12.307]  I will tell my webmaster to repost that or check and make sure it is posted.
[00:48:12.668 --> 00:48:13.368]  Okay, good man.
[00:48:13.548 --> 00:48:15.029]  And I will make sure it's there.
[00:48:15.049 --> 00:48:25.653]  But if not, just go to the nationalpost.ca, I believe, and type in that the ghost of Trotsky walks the White House halls was the headline.
[00:48:25.713 --> 00:48:26.393]  Okay, is that it?
[00:48:26.513 --> 00:48:26.873]  That's it.
[00:48:27.034 --> 00:48:27.754]  I want to thank you.
[00:48:28.174 --> 00:48:28.394]  All right.
[00:48:28.434 --> 00:48:28.994]  Thank you, Jake.
[00:48:29.274 --> 00:48:30.375]  More calls, more news coming up.
[00:48:31.994 --> 00:48:42.723]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.

[00:49:59.076 --> 00:50:07.920]  Not only does it contain every vitamin, mineral, amino acid, and enzyme known to man, but because it's in an organic liquid form, it offers a 98% absorption.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.422]  And what that means is your body gets to keep the nutrients that you swallow.
[00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.803]  Try delicious tasting sea silver today.

[00:50:21.866 --> 00:50:28.050]  Isn't it time you stopped flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:28.751]  1-888-887-2063.
[00:50:28.991 --> 00:50:38.857]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:40.277]  That's right, folks.
[00:50:40.317 --> 00:50:40.918]  DVD.
[00:50:41.098 --> 00:50:43.319]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:50:43.459 --> 00:50:45.540]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:50.763]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:50:51.103 --> 00:50:55.125]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:50:55.365 --> 00:50:55.545]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:50:55.565 --> 00:50:56.005]  Or order online.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:23.120]  888-253-3139
[00:51:59.802 --> 00:52:01.022]  Let me give you an example.
[00:52:01.122 --> 00:52:09.107]  I talk about this a lot because it's just so crazy of what biotech, engineering, nanotech, what all of this can do.
[00:52:09.127 --> 00:52:17.611]  A Texas company, Protege, just one of hundreds I can mention, got FDA authorization, an open-air test, the plant in 96 locations,
[00:52:19.355 --> 00:52:25.538]  Pharmacological corn that grows HIV virus in its kernels.
[00:52:27.719 --> 00:52:29.960]  It also was growing pig virus.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.121]  It grew a type of chemical used in tanning agents.
[00:52:33.501 --> 00:52:34.882]  That's what the AP said.
[00:52:36.076 --> 00:52:38.618]  I did a search on the internet, found an AP article.
[00:53:03.156 --> 00:53:08.718]  The company, there was another article a few months ago, and they finally got a fine, a slap on the wrist by the government.
[00:53:09.378 --> 00:53:10.759]  But the government let them do this.
[00:53:11.019 --> 00:53:14.640]  And you've got hundreds of these companies just out doing all this crazy stuff.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:23.883]  Gene splicing, splicing bugs with mammals, mammals with plants, fish with plants.
[00:53:23.963 --> 00:53:24.983]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:53:26.764 --> 00:53:27.204]  It makes...
[00:53:28.777 --> 00:53:33.978]  You know, something like Frankenstein or an old 50s horror movie looked like a joke.
[00:53:35.359 --> 00:53:36.459]  It's really happening.
[00:53:36.919 --> 00:53:38.279]  And this is what we know about.
[00:53:38.319 --> 00:53:39.960]  This is what's declassified.
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:45.021]  And the globalists are allowing all this to take place, all of this to happen.
[00:53:46.161 --> 00:53:56.304]  So, we already know that a level 4 bioweapons lab with viruses that will kill whole races of humanity, whole groups of people, admitted...
[00:53:57.663 --> 00:54:01.507]  Somehow allowed foot and mouth to be released from their facility, and it showed up all over the country.
[00:54:02.287 --> 00:54:03.508]  So, over in England.
[00:54:03.588 --> 00:54:05.330]  So, is this going to happen?
[00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:06.211]  When will it happen?
[00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:07.212]  How do we stop it?
[00:54:07.592 --> 00:54:13.998]  We know that globalists aren't going to stop it, but that's the excuse they use to their top minions, their personnel, their people.
[00:54:15.111 --> 00:54:15.331]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:54:15.351 --> 00:54:15.892]  How you doing?
[00:54:15.912 --> 00:54:15.992]  Fine.
[00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:53.096]  Say, Alex, it seems like to me these globalist leaders have all got their backs up against the wall here.
[00:54:54.117 --> 00:54:56.980]  Now they're, like, threatening to destroy the world here, huh?
[00:54:58.661 --> 00:55:00.703]  Well, that's what they said with the League of Nations.
[00:55:00.763 --> 00:55:05.067]  World War I killed 40 million people, about half of those influenzae.
[00:55:05.695 --> 00:55:06.015]  Yeah.
[00:55:06.095 --> 00:55:07.436]  You almost lost your son in World War II.
[00:55:07.476 --> 00:55:07.656]  Go ahead.
[00:55:33.536 --> 00:55:35.858]  Yeah, he almost lost his son in that war, too.
[00:55:35.878 --> 00:55:37.238]  Didn't he?
[00:55:38.639 --> 00:55:45.904]  Yeah, old Bush jumped out, didn't follow procedure, and went ahead and bailed out, but his partner didn't get out.
[00:55:46.765 --> 00:55:47.065]  Yeah.
[00:55:48.206 --> 00:55:50.067]  Got stuck in the ocean for a while.
[00:55:50.874 --> 00:55:59.578]  But a special submarine ran over to get the Skull and Bones boy, and he got shipped back to what they call the tomb in Connecticut and became an Order of Death member.
[00:55:59.918 --> 00:56:00.238]  Yeah.
[00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:02.819]  Got a mess going on here.
[00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:05.640]  Anything else you'd like to add in the next hour, sir?
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.722]  Well, what I was just going to say here is... Well, stay there.
[00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:09.802]  Don't hang up.
[00:56:10.242 --> 00:56:11.503]  I'll give you some time on the other side.
[00:56:11.523 --> 00:56:12.183]  We'll go to others.
[00:56:13.323 --> 00:56:15.464]  And the second hour is straight ahead.
[00:56:15.504 --> 00:56:16.285]  Please stay with us.
[00:56:16.925 --> 00:56:19.146]  Infowars.com is the website.
[00:56:21.613 --> 00:56:23.414]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:56:23.574 --> 00:56:29.235]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:56:29.535 --> 00:56:30.415]  Probably never, right?
[00:56:30.676 --> 00:56:32.596]  Hey, folks, Michael Trudeau here.
[00:56:36.417 --> 00:56:39.618]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.168 --> 00:56:47.808]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.469 --> 00:56:49.509]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.229 --> 00:56:51.350]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.810]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.571 --> 00:56:54.491]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.511 --> 00:56:58.753]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.333 --> 00:57:03.434]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:12.698]  All right, Larry Pratt, founder and president of Gunners of America, is joining us in the next segment to give us a legislative update.
[00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:17.322]  Of Hare Bush's gun grabbing operations out Clinton and Clinton.
[00:57:17.922 --> 00:57:22.746]  How they're resisting the gun grab in Canada to their incredible testament to their will.
[00:57:22.826 --> 00:57:28.710]  I want to thank them for their courage and their honor in getting involved in giving us this victory.
[00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:29.591]  It's a big victory.
[00:57:30.632 --> 00:57:36.336]  And we'll also talk about how Gun Owners of America is calling for a second amendment for the Iraqi people.
[00:57:37.034 --> 00:57:39.075]  Well, they had that before, but now it's been taken away.
[00:57:39.115 --> 00:57:40.496]  The gun confiscation has begun.
[00:57:40.956 --> 00:57:42.097]  Good training for our troops.
[00:57:42.117 --> 00:57:43.778]  We'll come back here and be police officers.
[00:57:44.458 --> 00:57:47.140]  But let's talk to Mac in Colorado.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.702]  Let him finish up, and we're going to get Larry Pratt on via stereo and ISDN line.
[00:57:52.163 --> 00:57:53.844]  Go ahead, Mac, finishing up your point.
[00:57:54.424 --> 00:57:54.844]  Okay.
[00:57:55.385 --> 00:58:02.689]  What I want to say is the way these globalists are and everything, and messing with everything like they're messing with,
[00:58:03.905 --> 00:58:05.507]  They're not going to get anywhere.
[00:58:05.527 --> 00:58:07.789]  All they're going to get is all of us destroyed.
[00:58:07.809 --> 00:58:09.890]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:11.331]  But see, that's what's leading them.
[00:58:11.351 --> 00:58:12.672]  They have this love of death.
[00:58:13.073 --> 00:58:13.333]  I know.
[00:58:13.353 --> 00:58:14.254]  They're all green.
[00:58:14.274 --> 00:58:17.116]  This power trip that they're on.
[00:58:17.176 --> 00:58:18.477]  And throughout history, Mac...
[00:58:19.855 --> 00:58:19.995]  Yep.
[00:58:20.015 --> 00:58:20.075]  Yep.
[00:58:20.095 --> 00:58:21.998]  And then that's going to end up, we're all going to be gone.
[00:58:39.744 --> 00:58:41.525]  There ain't nobody going to gain anything.
[00:58:41.645 --> 00:58:44.987]  The biggest threat is this genetic engineering, and they want it to get out.
[00:58:45.287 --> 00:58:53.591]  They want it to cause crises, and then they'll take over and federalize the farms, the factories, medicine, everything.
[00:58:53.751 --> 00:59:00.314]  Out of crises, they get more control, when time and time again, it's the government and its private owners that create the crisis.
[00:59:00.714 --> 00:59:02.635]  You know what they remind me of?
[00:59:03.035 --> 00:59:06.197]  Like some mad scientist in some horror movie.
[00:59:06.832 --> 00:59:07.933]  That's what they remind me of.
[00:59:07.953 --> 00:59:18.701]  Well, there have been real mad scientists throughout history, like Joseph Mingala, who was into torture, the Nazi, but now our government tells us torture is good if we're doing it.
[00:59:19.602 --> 00:59:20.603]  Torture's good, huh?
[00:59:20.803 --> 00:59:23.165]  How many times have you seen him on the news say torture's good?
[00:59:23.925 --> 00:59:24.526]  Yeah, a lot.
[00:59:25.026 --> 00:59:30.070]  Yeah, I know I've seen it a hundred times, and everybody else, I watch two hours of TV a week unless it's C-SPAN.
[00:59:30.871 --> 00:59:35.855]  I'd imagine the listenership watching an average of three hours a day has probably seen it a thousand times.
[00:59:36.812 --> 00:59:38.913]  Yeah, they're all into this torture talk now.
[00:59:39.154 --> 00:59:41.135]  Oh, torture's a good American value.
[00:59:41.435 --> 00:59:41.895]  Mm-hmm.
[00:59:42.956 --> 00:59:44.197]  All right, thanks for the call, Mac.
[00:59:46.118 --> 00:59:50.681]  Yep, we're losing our soul, folks, and we're doing it through these crises that are manufactured.
[00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:53.362]  Now, Larry pressed me with this for about 30 minutes, and he joins us now.
[00:59:53.382 --> 00:59:54.103]  We're about to break.
[00:59:54.733 --> 00:59:59.497]  But Larry, what are some of the things we're going to be talking about in the next 30 minutes here on the air?
[00:59:59.857 --> 01:00:11.186]  Well, Alex, one of the things that strikes me as peculiar is the greater amount of firearms freedoms being allowed to people of Iraq compared to the folks in the United States by the same administration.
[01:00:11.667 --> 01:00:14.209]  Well, they haven't gotten them trained yet like they have us.
[01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:18.212]  They're telling them, first they said hand them in, they wouldn't.
[01:00:18.332 --> 01:00:20.814]  So, okay, just let us register those.
[01:00:20.854 --> 01:00:23.396]  The Iraqis are saying in their news, you want to take them.
[01:00:23.436 --> 01:00:24.217]  We know what you'll do.
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.605]  You know, these guys may have had a tough life, but that didn't make them stupid.
[01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:30.026]  Exactly.
[01:00:31.348 --> 01:00:41.421]  So that strikes me as hopefully something that's going to enable us to kill the renewal of the semi-auto ban.
[01:00:42.362 --> 01:00:43.663]  The disparity is so...
[01:00:44.605 --> 01:00:45.066]  Clear.
[01:00:45.126 --> 01:00:51.291]  In Iraq, we're talking about actual military full-auto machine gun AK-47.
[01:00:51.592 --> 01:00:58.438]  In the United States, we're talking about semi-auto firearms that have never been used by any military in the world.
[01:00:58.598 --> 01:01:01.221]  We'll talk about the new Bush-Clinton-Schumer...
[01:01:01.841 --> 01:01:02.021]  I think?
[01:01:21.799 --> 01:01:27.603]  And I also want to talk about Canada, many of their provinces refusing to turn their guns in.
[01:01:27.723 --> 01:01:28.243]  Okay, Larry?
[01:01:28.523 --> 01:01:29.004]  Very good.
[01:01:29.304 --> 01:01:29.904]  Fantastic.
[01:01:29.924 --> 01:01:31.325]  Gunowners.org is the website.

[01:01:33.987 --> 01:01:38.990]  We'll be right back with Larry Pratt, who we're honored to have on the show, carrying the standard for the Second Amendment.
[01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:39.590]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:42.634 --> 01:01:46.978]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:01:47.158 --> 01:01:51.602]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:01:51.742 --> 01:01:56.145]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:57.507]  The New World Order.
[01:01:59.295 --> 01:02:03.519]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:02:03.579 --> 01:02:10.505]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:02:10.645 --> 01:02:12.747]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:02:13.007 --> 01:02:23.336]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:02:23.636 --> 01:02:28.999]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Take Three, is for you.
[01:02:29.519 --> 01:02:32.181]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:02:32.261 --> 01:02:33.421]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:02:33.902 --> 01:02:35.723]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:02:43.519 --> 01:02:49.447]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:02:49.688 --> 01:02:51.931]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:02:52.131 --> 01:02:58.500]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:02:59.481]  We're good to go.
[01:03:19.019 --> 01:03:19.559]  We're good to go.
[01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:20.360]  We're good to go.
[01:03:41.081 --> 01:03:45.124]  I'm on the phone with Marilyn from Calvera, who's going to explain a little bit about this new diet.
[01:03:45.425 --> 01:03:46.445]  Marilyn, tell us about it.
[01:03:46.605 --> 01:03:48.847]  Well, it's a collagen protein supplement.
[01:03:49.087 --> 01:03:51.269]  It has collagen, aloe vera, and glycerin.
[01:03:51.469 --> 01:03:56.593]  You take three gel caps at night, and it helps build up some lean muscle, and it burns stored body fat.
[01:03:56.693 --> 01:03:57.934]  Wow, that sounds fantastic.
[01:03:57.974 --> 01:03:58.475]  How does it work?
[01:03:58.655 --> 01:04:00.857]  Well, because the collagen is the key.
[01:04:01.097 --> 01:04:04.920]  When you take collagen on an empty stomach, it helps burn away that stored body fat.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:10.041]  And it's really good for you because this product has no drugs, no stimulants of any kind.
[01:04:10.181 --> 01:04:12.102]  There's no special foods to eat.
[01:04:12.422 --> 01:04:14.382]  You simply take these three gel caps at night.
[01:04:14.683 --> 01:04:16.763]  That's your whole plan and there's nothing more to it.
[01:04:16.843 --> 01:04:21.144]  But the average weight loss is a pant size a month with an 86% success rate.
[01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:23.805]  Marilyn, how can folks get a hold of you if they want to order Calvera?
[01:04:24.065 --> 01:04:24.965]  It's very simple.

[01:04:31.488 --> 01:04:34.829]  That's 1-888-601-7546.
[01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:36.950]  Well, Marilyn, that sounds fantastic.
[01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:40.172]  We'll check back with you a little bit later to learn more about this exciting new product.
[01:04:40.332 --> 01:04:41.012]  Okay, thanks.
[01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:45.823]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:46.403 --> 01:04:49.204]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:08.294 --> 01:05:13.397]  Alright folks, we're talking to Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.
[01:05:13.417 --> 01:05:15.058]  Be sure and visit gunowners.org.
[01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:18.940]  Also, be sure and go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:22.502]  Get my new video, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:05:22.542 --> 01:05:23.803]  It gets into gun control.
[01:05:24.363 --> 01:05:28.205]  The new Clinton slash Bush, Chuckie Schumer assault weapons ban.
[01:05:28.785 --> 01:05:32.047]  And we get into the whole Police State and Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:35.309]  And rumors of Patriot Act 3.
[01:05:35.369 --> 01:05:36.550]  We've confirmed Patriot Act 2.
[01:05:37.722 --> 01:05:38.103]  We're good to go.
[01:05:59.477 --> 01:06:07.525]  Copies of my videos for non-profit, not for self-purposes, to spread the word and to use the power of the grassroots to educate the people about what we're really facing.
[01:06:07.565 --> 01:06:09.887]  So, take action to get the new film today.
[01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:22.840]  Larry Pratt, before we get into Iraqis having more freedom with guns than Americans, and before we get into Canada, most of its states, its provinces, saying, no, we're not going to turn our guns in,
[01:06:23.658 --> 01:06:37.784]  And before we get into the new assault weapons ban by Hare Bush and the liberals and the neocons, Patriot Act 1 and 2, your lawyers wrote an incredible 20-plus page analysis of it, even scarier than mine.
[01:06:38.184 --> 01:06:39.344]  You found stuff I didn't find.
[01:06:39.384 --> 01:06:40.585]  I found stuff you didn't find in it.
[01:06:41.571 --> 01:06:47.236]  The secret arrest of citizens, the secret executions, the guns being crimes, all of this garbage.
[01:06:47.897 --> 01:06:52.100]  Ashcroft said there wasn't a Patriot Act II before Congress two months ago.
[01:06:52.501 --> 01:06:54.222]  Now, last Thursday, he admitted it.
[01:06:54.362 --> 01:06:55.884]  There is an expansion of it.
[01:06:56.684 --> 01:07:01.589]  Your response, your analysis of the Patriot Act, and why do you think Ashcroft had to admit this?
[01:07:03.112 --> 01:07:08.156]  I believe he had to admit it because the grassroots is afire with this.
[01:07:08.936 --> 01:07:13.119]  Interestingly, both on the left and on the right, but the left doesn't really have much of a grassroots.
[01:07:13.619 --> 01:07:17.742]  So when you're talking about grassroots, you're really talking about folks like us.
[01:07:18.663 --> 01:07:21.745]  And the input to Congress is...
[01:07:22.466 --> 01:07:23.487]  We're good to go.
[01:07:50.126 --> 01:07:51.187]  I think we're good to go.
[01:08:14.406 --> 01:08:15.046]  We're good to go.
[01:08:15.066 --> 01:08:15.387]  I think?
[01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:38.898]  But for goodness sakes, we don't want you to pass another bill concentrating more power in Washington.
[01:08:39.059 --> 01:08:40.559]  You've already gone too far.
[01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:42.660]  Let what you've got expire.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.201]  And they're also trying to get rid of the sunset, as you just said.
[01:08:47.261 --> 01:08:58.124]  But already in the first Patriot Act, the key provisions like 213, the sneak and peek, and others, and the expanded definition of terrorism, Section 802, those are not sunsetted.
[01:08:58.584 --> 01:09:01.005]  And Larry, this is their incredible spin.
[01:09:01.685 --> 01:09:03.687]  I've written an analysis of Patriot Act II.
[01:09:03.767 --> 01:09:04.748]  We have a copy of it.
[01:09:04.788 --> 01:09:10.833]  The legislative control sheet was brought by the Justice Department to Dennis Hastert, brought to him secretly, and to Dick Cheney.
[01:09:10.853 --> 01:09:12.935]  But that's the red herring of the House bill.
[01:09:13.595 --> 01:09:14.736]  It has been introduced.
[01:09:14.957 --> 01:09:16.458]  The House version is the...
[01:09:17.401 --> 01:09:18.962]  Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:22.385]  The House version was introduced six months ago in January.
[01:09:23.045 --> 01:09:25.888]  It is the Justice Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[01:09:26.268 --> 01:09:29.971]  It has all the same provisions under different subsections as the House bill.
[01:09:30.411 --> 01:09:31.492]  It has been enrolled.
[01:09:32.092 --> 01:09:34.414]  And in it, it has added gun control.
[01:09:34.514 --> 01:09:37.276]  It is sponsored by the worst Democrats on the Hill.
[01:09:37.376 --> 01:09:39.778]  So I might point you to S-22.
[01:09:40.338 --> 01:09:45.162]  Well, S-22 definitely is the mother of all gun control bills.
[01:09:45.222 --> 01:09:45.963]  It's got everything...
[01:09:47.144 --> 01:09:54.830]  Short of a ban that they would love to have, it is the Brady campaign shopping list.
[01:09:56.131 --> 01:10:04.257]  And of course, in moments of crisis, they can easily tack on anything that they might have left out to see if they can't slip that through as well.
[01:10:05.363 --> 01:10:10.667]  I think that's the great danger and that we've just got to be doing our work now.
[01:10:11.328 --> 01:10:18.413]  What is so wonderful about the members of Gun Owners of America is that they have been so tenacious and so persistent.
[01:10:19.073 --> 01:10:24.577]  They remind me of the widow in Luke 18 who went before an unrighteous judge.
[01:10:25.237 --> 01:10:26.899]  Times don't change.
[01:10:27.379 --> 01:10:32.883]  He blew her off because she was a nobody and he didn't think that he had to give her anything.
[01:10:33.463 --> 01:10:38.726]  Well, a lot of folks would say, well, gee, I guess if the government said so, it must be legitimate.
[01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:41.747]  And then and now, most people would have just walked away.
[01:10:42.248 --> 01:10:46.330]  But the widow knew that what she wanted, whatever it was, was right, and she persisted.
[01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:54.234]  And finally the judge, the unrighteous judge, gave in, gave her what she wants, saying, and this is the quote from the scripture, she troubles me.
[01:10:54.974 --> 01:10:59.596]  And if we don't trouble them, I guarantee you they're going to trouble us.
[01:11:00.377 --> 01:11:00.977]  Well, that's it.
[01:11:00.997 --> 01:11:02.718]  We've got to keep their feet to the fire, but
[01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:04.451]  Now, this is curious.
[01:11:05.352 --> 01:11:06.653]  I've done a lot of talk show interviews.
[01:11:06.673 --> 01:11:08.594]  You probably do as many as I do or more, Larry.
[01:11:09.675 --> 01:11:14.679]  And I've been on conservative talk shows, and I'll say, Bush says he's going to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.861]  And they'll say, that's not true.
[01:11:17.702 --> 01:11:21.645]  And then they'll say, you're a liberal making up information to discredit Bush.
[01:11:22.286 --> 01:11:32.534]  Why do we see, I don't see this widespread, but I do see pockets of it, massive denial by so many conservatives to the neocon agenda we see in Washington.
[01:11:33.166 --> 01:11:43.317]  I think denial is a very major and consistent human problem that we all have to deal with at one time or another about one thing or another.
[01:11:43.778 --> 01:11:48.503]  If something just seems too horrible to think about, you just
[01:11:49.256 --> 01:11:50.418]  Wow, that couldn't happen here.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.324]  No government in the United States would ever become tyrannical.
[01:11:55.085 --> 01:11:59.351]  Ask a bunch of Germans what they thought in 1930 and then what they thought in 1940.
[01:11:59.671 --> 01:12:02.856]  A lot can change in a very short period of time.
[01:12:03.517 --> 01:12:05.380]  And to say that it can't happen here...
[01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:09.771]  To a certain extent, I suppose, lazy man's way of dealing with it.
[01:12:10.131 --> 01:12:11.852]  If it can't happen, then I don't have to deal with it.
[01:12:12.092 --> 01:12:16.055]  I don't have to do anything, and therefore I don't even need to ask for an excuse.
[01:12:16.515 --> 01:12:23.199]  Well, Larry, it is happening here, and we've got a unified front by the Hillary Clintons, the Chuckie Schumers, with Bush.
[01:12:24.062 --> 01:12:32.745]  On open borders, on gun control, on NAFTA and GATT, on all these key issues, on protecting Bill Clinton, blocking Dan Burton's committee.
[01:12:32.945 --> 01:12:43.969]  Ari Fleischer, the press secretary, a couple weeks ago told the World Net Daily reporter, when they brought up Hardingate and how Bush is protecting Clinton, he said, the president's moving forward and he suggests you do the same.
[01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:59.856]  Let me point back to the gun issue and the semi-auto ban just for a minute, because some people will acknowledge that they've heard the president, spokesman anyway, say that that's what he wants to do, to renew the ban, keep it on the books.
[01:13:00.577 --> 01:13:03.319]  They'll say, well, but hey, we don't have to worry about that.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.802]  The House of Representatives isn't going to vote for that.
[01:13:05.922 --> 01:13:06.663]  It's under control.
[01:13:07.435 --> 01:13:08.956]  Well, part of that's true.
[01:13:09.176 --> 01:13:12.638]  I don't think the House of Representatives is where we're going to get clobbered.
[01:13:12.918 --> 01:13:14.359]  But here's how it can happen.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.581]  It's already happened this way in the past.
[01:13:17.021 --> 01:13:35.072]  When Lautenberg put his gun ban in, greatly expanding the number of prohibited people that are allowed to own a gun in this country, people that have had domestic violence misdemeanors, spanking a child, yelling at a dad, things like that, those people got stuck in 1996...
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:44.126]  It was a measure that he inserted in a conference committee behind closed doors.
[01:13:44.286 --> 01:13:47.928]  Yeah, they can load it in his pork barrel at any time and Bush says he'll sign it.
[01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:49.750]  Now, here's the problem.
[01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:51.431]  It comes out of a conference committee.
[01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:53.913]  It's already been voted on in some fashion.
[01:13:54.133 --> 01:13:57.416]  The underlying bill has, anyway, in both...
[01:13:58.096 --> 01:13:59.297]  We're good to go.
[01:14:24.096 --> 01:14:24.356]  Well, take S-22.
[01:14:24.396 --> 01:14:25.758]  It's a law enforcement anti-terror...
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:43.661]  Law enforcement funding package.
[01:14:43.701 --> 01:14:47.743]  It's a giant spending bill, and they've got all this stuff in there.
[01:14:47.763 --> 01:14:48.863]  I mean, this is what they're doing.
[01:14:49.264 --> 01:14:49.704]  Exactly.
[01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:52.465]  Now, Bush wouldn't sign that.
[01:14:52.845 --> 01:14:54.546]  At least we don't think he would.
[01:14:54.586 --> 01:14:58.448]  So that probably keeps my scenario from occurring.
[01:14:58.508 --> 01:15:01.850]  But with the semi-auto ban, he said he would sign it.
[01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.791]  So, hey, we don't have to shut down the government.
[01:15:03.811 --> 01:15:05.311]  We'll just give it to him, and he'll sign it.
[01:15:05.411 --> 01:15:10.734]  Well, he's supposed to be a conservative, and we're seeing the opposite behavior.
[01:15:11.539 --> 01:15:25.282]  From Bush, and I just think it's a big wake-up call for people, and there could be a mass shooting the week of the vote, which even Limbaugh has pointed out, just keeps happening right on time for them, and that could easily get it through.
[01:15:25.682 --> 01:15:26.763]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:15:26.903 --> 01:15:39.866]  I think reality has begun to impinge on the principal culprit, in my opinion, well, of course, it's the president for allowing the statements to be made, but Karl Rove is his principal political advisor, and I don't
[01:15:40.607 --> 01:15:49.584]  I see him as a principled man at all, and I see him figuring that, hey, we're going to get some easy votes from the soccer moms, and the Gunnies don't have any other place to go.
[01:15:50.282 --> 01:15:58.008]  Well, first of all, that's a flawed analysis, because the people that voted for George Bush in West Virginia are not quote-unquote gunnies.
[01:15:58.028 --> 01:16:02.231]  They're Democrats who normally vote Democratic no matter what.
[01:16:02.752 --> 01:16:09.997]  Yeah, Bush would have totally lost the election worse than he did in the general vote if it wasn't for the gunners.
[01:16:10.257 --> 01:16:14.721]  Absolutely, and so these people have no fear whatsoever of voting for Democrats.
[01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:16.543]  It could happen all over again.
[01:16:17.584 --> 01:16:18.905]  Maybe we'll have a chance to continue.
[01:16:18.925 --> 01:16:19.906]  Yeah, we'll talk about that.
[01:16:20.046 --> 01:16:23.850]  Great analysis from Larry Pratt, founder and president of Gunners of America.
[01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:27.433]  Gunners.org, great analysis, great information, great organization.
[01:16:28.234 --> 01:16:29.935]  And we'll come back and talk about Iraq.
[01:16:29.995 --> 01:16:32.478]  They have more rights there than we do here for guns.
[01:16:32.498 --> 01:16:34.019]  Then we'll talk about Canada.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.304]  Most of their big provinces are saying, we're not going to register and take the guns.
[01:16:39.444 --> 01:16:40.165]  No feds.
[01:16:43.012 --> 01:16:43.612]  Hello, folks.
[01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:44.613]  This is Alex Jones.

[01:19:30.568 --> 01:19:33.010]  The very rights our government was created to protect.
[01:19:33.150 --> 01:19:35.772]  The Freedom Calendar is available now at Midas Resources.

[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:43.041]  We're good to go.

[01:20:28.886 --> 01:20:29.706]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:20:29.726 --> 01:20:30.907]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:56.587 --> 01:20:59.769]  We're talking to Larry Pratt, Gun Owners of America.
[01:21:02.531 --> 01:21:10.796]  Larry, it's not just the gun issues that the neocons are on the big government tyranny side of the fence.
[01:21:12.176 --> 01:21:13.137]  It's across the board.
[01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:19.761]  And it is important for gun owners to be involved and conservatives to be involved by pointing this out.
[01:21:20.541 --> 01:21:22.723]  We are now seeing a shift, at least in rhetoric,
[01:21:23.326 --> 01:21:32.109]  Back to a more conservative viewpoint, because of pressure, I talked about how the NRA wouldn't talk about the assault weapons ban, how Bush is going to reauthorize it.
[01:21:32.449 --> 01:21:34.390]  They finally did in their legislative alert.
[01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:35.750]  They really won't do it in their magazine.
[01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:45.494]  How important was it that the real gun owners, real conservatives, are forcing the NRA to not be as anti-gun as they are?
[01:21:46.361 --> 01:21:57.488]  We hear from our members all the time, those that get emailed particularly, because that's how word spreads so quickly and effectively now, that they've also contacted the NRA.
[01:21:57.548 --> 01:22:03.732]  They belong to both and they see us doing something and they want the NRA to do the same thing.
[01:22:04.012 --> 01:22:07.855]  I can tell you that they can express themselves in very forceful ways.
[01:22:07.935 --> 01:22:09.896]  I wanted to share with you an anecdote of...
[01:22:10.536 --> 01:22:11.237]  We're good to go.
[01:22:29.537 --> 01:22:33.159]  One of whom was our member, and I'll just refer to him as Sam.
[01:22:33.659 --> 01:22:40.043]  But Sam asked a question something like, What in the world do you think you guys are doing with this?
[01:22:40.783 --> 01:22:46.106]  And he got back a very imperious answer that this is the way it is, Bud.
[01:22:46.686 --> 01:22:54.571]  Well, Sam didn't really like that, so he went with a group of other people that wanted to shake Ro's hand and whatnot as he was on his way to the limo.
[01:22:54.851 --> 01:22:56.892]  And just before he popped in the back door...
[01:22:57.632 --> 01:23:06.976]  Sam was able to repeat the question, and Rove was visibly angry and started repeating how he didn't understand politics and blah, blah, blah, and grabbed Sam on the arm.
[01:23:06.996 --> 01:23:10.757]  And Sam said, well, I'm older than he is, and I'm bigger than he is.
[01:23:10.777 --> 01:23:21.782]  And I grabbed him on his arm, and I said, look, you tell your boss if he signs that bill, he's crossed the line.
[01:23:22.789 --> 01:23:27.993]  And Rove was beside himself, didn't know what to say, and just let him drive him away at that point.
[01:23:28.554 --> 01:23:37.921]  They're finally beginning to see that this is not something like whether the sugar beet industry gets more protection or not.
[01:23:39.142 --> 01:23:43.148]  That's just the way it is.
[01:23:43.208 --> 01:23:53.904]  Now, they're understanding this is about the Bill of Rights and what America is, and if they're going to wrap themselves in that flag, they're going to have to uphold the values of that Constitution and that Bill of Rights.
[01:23:54.719 --> 01:23:56.440]  Larry Pratt, I want to shift gears for a second.
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:57.481]  Sure.
[01:23:57.601 --> 01:24:02.725]  Canada, many of their big provinces are saying, we are not going to enforce your gun ban.
[01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:05.647]  You register them, you confiscate them.
[01:24:05.667 --> 01:24:13.332]  They're actually saying, one of the heads of the provinces says, of their law enforcement arm, says, this only hurts law-abiding citizens.
[01:24:13.372 --> 01:24:14.233]  This is wrong.
[01:24:15.094 --> 01:24:20.858]  And now police, the federal police, are warning the provinces, and more provinces are defecting now, the majority of them.
[01:24:21.558 --> 01:24:22.539]  Is this good news?
[01:24:22.559 --> 01:24:22.619]  Yes.
[01:24:23.286 --> 01:24:33.918]  I think it's extremely good news, particularly when you consider that it's Canada where they have more of a British mindset that whatever the government says is legitimate because there's no legitimate constitution in writing.
[01:24:34.298 --> 01:24:38.803]  But they've heard about the crime rate exploding in England and Australia after the gun bans.
[01:24:38.843 --> 01:24:39.524]  They know the truth.
[01:24:40.124 --> 01:24:48.511]  They do, and I think the driver for this resistance to this tyranny has been the province of Alberta.
[01:24:48.972 --> 01:24:52.235]  Those folks really think like people in the western United States.
[01:24:52.655 --> 01:24:57.699]  They've taken the lead on this, and frankly, the province of Alberta, and I've talked to people from there.
[01:24:57.719 --> 01:25:03.224]  In fact, I interviewed one on my little talk show that's a weekly hour thing, a live fire.
[01:25:04.064 --> 01:25:04.945]  I think so.
[01:25:19.536 --> 01:25:20.297]  In a heartbeat.
[01:25:20.537 --> 01:25:23.379]  And then make themselves an independent country with lots of oil.
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:31.345]  But, I mean, that's exciting that you have whole states refusing, and then their citizens are on TV saying, I'm not turning my gun and you can come get it.
[01:25:31.645 --> 01:25:39.511]  We need more of that attitude here, and we need to have those revolutions of information and standing up in these states like Massachusetts, California.
[01:25:39.611 --> 01:25:40.692]  I know we've got the people.
[01:25:40.972 --> 01:25:42.433]  We just don't have the media power.
[01:25:42.733 --> 01:25:44.855]  We've got to promote the alternative media in those states.
[01:25:45.195 --> 01:25:46.136]  What about Iraq?
[01:25:46.296 --> 01:25:46.957]  Not arming...
[01:25:48.457 --> 01:25:52.518]  Disarming the American people, but having to back off and not disarm the Iraqi people.
[01:25:52.979 --> 01:26:01.141]  I think that's going to be a very effective tool in trying to keep the lid on the semi-auto ban and keep it from being renewed.
[01:26:01.501 --> 01:26:05.362]  Because they're going to be allowed to own semi-autos, fully autos there, but we can't here.
[01:26:05.842 --> 01:26:07.803]  Oh, I think that really sticks in the throat.
[01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:11.577]  All right, Larry Pratt, GunOwners.org.
[01:26:11.637 --> 01:26:13.458]  Thank you so much for coming on the show.
[01:26:13.758 --> 01:26:14.418]  Alex, thank you.
[01:26:14.598 --> 01:26:17.158]  Your site's got incredible legislative analysis and information.
[01:26:17.178 --> 01:26:18.039]  I visit it daily.
[01:26:18.559 --> 01:26:19.059]  God bless you.
[01:26:19.099 --> 01:26:20.539]  We look forward to having you back up in the future.
[01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:21.239]  Same here.
[01:26:21.339 --> 01:26:21.599]  Thank you.
[01:26:21.859 --> 01:26:22.619]  Take care, my friend.
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:24.480]  I'll be right back.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.740]  I'll get into Walmart, pushing the RFID.
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:28.360]  New information on that.
[01:26:28.901 --> 01:26:30.521]  Retina scanners to drive your car.
[01:26:30.561 --> 01:26:31.301]  It's all coming up.
[01:26:33.801 --> 01:26:34.682]  We're on the march.
[01:26:35.182 --> 01:26:36.682]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.683 --> 01:26:40.485]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:45.327 --> 01:26:53.512]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:26:53.692 --> 01:26:57.034]  The Aeronizer filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:26:57.054 --> 01:26:57.254]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:27:26.219 --> 01:27:32.385]  Welcome back.
[01:27:32.445 --> 01:27:33.406]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:27:33.446 --> 01:27:38.531]  We're now an hour and a half into this worldwide broadcast, 33 minutes out of the hour.
[01:27:39.873 --> 01:27:41.093]  More of your calls coming up.
[01:27:41.133 --> 01:27:50.275]  If you'd like to join us on air, what Larry Pratt was covering, or any of the news items that I've already gone over, any particular news piece you'd like to discuss, the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:27:50.295 --> 01:27:50.715]  800-259-9231.
[01:27:51.735 --> 01:28:02.257]  I want to get back into this British scientist puts odds for apocalypse at 50-50.
[01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:09.018]  The real things that are threatening us, the genetic engineering, the new types of nuclear testing that are being done,
[01:28:10.388 --> 01:28:13.992]  The superconducting supercolliders, the things that are going on there.
[01:28:15.855 --> 01:28:24.205]  But a story I didn't cover yesterday, and I should have, but this is how desensitized to horror and evil I've gotten, was out of the London Telegraph.
[01:28:24.525 --> 01:28:27.910]  Famine struck North Koreans eating children.
[01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:28.811]  That's coming up.
[01:28:29.717 --> 01:28:44.243]  And also, when I get into driver's eye movements measured to test tiredness, you'll have to retina scan, as I told you last year, as the Houston Chronicle said, to start your car while the police are being given the system worldwide.
[01:28:45.224 --> 01:28:48.005]  Walmart to throw its weight behind RFID.
[01:28:48.025 --> 01:28:52.007]  Now, I told you they're getting behind this small microchip tracking system, but...
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:53.720]  We're good to go.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:54.121]  I think?
[01:29:19.699 --> 01:29:21.440]  They've got half of some products.
[01:29:21.841 --> 01:29:23.602]  They sell half of some products.
[01:29:24.103 --> 01:29:27.806]  If they say you've got to put this in your product, all manufacturers are going to do this.
[01:29:28.606 --> 01:29:31.449]  And that is now being pointed out by CNET News.
[01:29:32.189 --> 01:29:33.010]  That is coming up.
[01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:37.554]  Also, more brain scanners and stress test systems for the airports.
[01:29:37.954 --> 01:29:40.776]  And then, of course, they'll be at the highway checkpoints.
[01:29:40.796 --> 01:29:42.277]  They're building into the roads now.
[01:29:43.118 --> 01:29:45.380]  This and much more coming up.
[01:29:46.101 --> 01:29:49.785]  The toll-free number to join us to talk about all these issues is 800-259-9231.
[01:29:49.805 --> 01:29:59.755]  Before I go any further, I really want to invite the listeners of this worldwide broadcast to order my documentary films.
[01:29:59.956 --> 01:30:06.643]  I have produced nine films, the ninth film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement is now out.
[01:30:09.953 --> 01:30:14.736]  Now shipping, and it's an amazing film, two hours, 37 minutes long.
[01:30:15.356 --> 01:30:24.941]  The greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us, a scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn to enslave every man, woman, and child.
[01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:31.705]  The United States government at all levels has fallen under the control of the desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[01:30:32.503 --> 01:30:43.377]  The events of September 11th marked the initiation of the final sick push of the Illuminati to consolidate their one world order and transform Earth into a prison planet.
[01:30:43.818 --> 01:30:49.806]  In over two and a half hours, I chronicle in stunning detail the true character of the globalist...
[01:30:50.538 --> 01:30:51.758]  Master Plan.
[01:30:52.279 --> 01:31:00.341]  Learn the plan of the bloodthirsty elite that financially, physically, and spiritually imprison not only America, but the world.
[01:31:00.361 --> 01:31:07.644]  Total Enslavement is the third installment in my critically acclaimed Police State series and is a must-see for all who love freedom.
[01:31:08.104 --> 01:31:19.954]  This film documents the nightmare rise of the Homeland Security Dictatorship, Patriot Act I and II, Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison surveillance economy, and much more.
[01:31:20.394 --> 01:31:28.921]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism and how the globalist poses our saviors when, in fact, they are the terrorists.
[01:31:30.931 --> 01:31:33.212]  So you need to get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:31:33.272 --> 01:31:45.679]  If you haven't gotten 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, that covers 9-1-1 and The Globalist Plan as well, other facets of it, if you haven't gotten Part 2 of that film, The Masters of Terror, you need to get them first.
[01:31:45.779 --> 01:31:48.941]  Because this is a great film, but it's the continuation of that.
[01:31:49.061 --> 01:31:50.122]  All my films do this.
[01:31:51.222 --> 01:31:54.024]  And the videos are $25.95 apiece, $20 if you order three or more of any of the nine.
[01:31:59.025 --> 01:32:03.670]  You can get three of one title or two of one title and another title or three different titles.
[01:32:04.591 --> 01:32:07.234]  And that discount continues as you get three or more.
[01:32:07.394 --> 01:32:17.925]  So it's an $18 discount on the three-tape special, $24 discount on the four-tape special, $30 discount on the three-tape special, and so on and so forth.
[01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:20.708]  So I really do hope that you get the videos.
[01:32:21.374 --> 01:32:24.936]  I also have my book, Descent into Tyranny, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:32:25.416 --> 01:32:31.999]  It's 230 pages, covers 9-1-1 and government-sponsored terror and their master plan and where they're going in the future.
[01:32:32.019 --> 01:32:36.902]  For those that like books, it's well-written, concentrated, page-by-page.
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:43.181]  It's kind of like a reader's digest, but it's 230 pages long, concentrated info, only $12.
[01:32:44.782 --> 01:32:51.203]  So go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:51.223 --> 01:32:52.223]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:33:04.756 --> 01:33:13.301]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:33:14.902 --> 01:33:19.004]  Get the videos, make copies, air them on AXS TV.
[01:33:19.044 --> 01:33:20.385]  I want to thank those that have done this.
[01:33:20.405 --> 01:33:21.345]  You've done a great job.
[01:33:21.645 --> 01:33:25.127]  But if you haven't done it, join this grassroots fight against the globalists.
[01:33:25.387 --> 01:33:28.409]  We are unlocking more minds every day by the millions.
[01:33:29.179 --> 01:33:31.201]  Just through this show, thanks to you.
[01:33:31.281 --> 01:33:32.122]  So I commend you.
[01:33:32.142 --> 01:33:43.651]  If you haven't gotten in the fight, join us in this historical war for liberty and freedom to restore the Bill of Rights and Constitution against the enemy combatants, against the usurpers of the New World Order that are overthrowing this republic.
[01:33:43.671 --> 01:33:44.272]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:33:44.292 --> 01:33:44.772]  All right.
[01:33:44.792 --> 01:33:51.238]  Let me cover some news, then we'll get into your calls.
[01:33:56.781 --> 01:34:02.964]  Now, again, I see stories about mobile Chinese execution vans, and our government's giving them grants to pay for all this.
[01:34:04.104 --> 01:34:09.106]  And our government pays for grants to force relocate the Tibetans and all this other stuff.
[01:34:09.166 --> 01:34:17.250]  But this is out of North Korea that Donald Rumsfeld gave nuclear reactors to, according to the BBC.
[01:34:17.950 --> 01:34:20.651]  Famine struck North Korea eating children.
[01:34:21.573 --> 01:34:22.314]  Let me say that again.
[01:34:22.814 --> 01:34:25.456]  Famine struck North Korea eating children.
[01:34:25.917 --> 01:34:26.897]  London Telegraph.
[01:34:27.438 --> 01:34:37.626]  Cannibalism is increasing in North Korea following another poor harvest and a big cut in international food aid according to refugees who have fled the stricken country.
[01:34:37.646 --> 01:34:39.748]  Now this is from a liberal point of view.
[01:34:39.768 --> 01:34:41.109]  Let me explain why this is happening.
[01:34:42.569 --> 01:34:45.731]  Because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:34:45.771 --> 01:34:48.553]  Because Kim Jong-il is a hereditary dictator.
[01:34:48.573 --> 01:34:54.236]  Whenever you've got people's kids becoming the leader, you know, the old leader's kid becomes the leader, you know you're in a police state.
[01:34:54.616 --> 01:34:55.637]  You know you're in deep trouble.
[01:34:57.378 --> 01:34:58.959]  It's light years ahead of nepotism.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.201]  The guy has been caught in the 80s and 90s.
[01:35:02.221 --> 01:35:03.622]  He just apologized last year.
[01:35:05.214 --> 01:35:10.376]  Has kidnapped dozens of Asian film stars, Japanese, South Korean film stars.
[01:35:10.416 --> 01:35:15.058]  He has had aircraft hijacked to bring particular film stars back that he wants.
[01:35:15.998 --> 01:35:21.900]  And he apologized to the Japanese Prime Minister about eight months ago, in late 2002, for, quote, killing them.
[01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:23.241]  He said, yes, I killed them.
[01:35:24.021 --> 01:35:25.442]  I'm sorry, I won't do that anymore.
[01:35:25.482 --> 01:35:29.223]  Because Japan wouldn't even talk to him about aid until he apologized.
[01:35:30.026 --> 01:35:32.568]  He is a little five-foot-one demon.
[01:35:33.168 --> 01:35:35.710]  He lives in a seven-story pleasure palace.
[01:35:36.090 --> 01:35:36.811]  This is admitted.
[01:35:38.592 --> 01:35:43.556]  We've had doctors on the show who were liberals and went there to, quote, aid North Korea, thinking it was all propaganda.
[01:35:45.417 --> 01:35:56.365]  The people's hospitals are beer bottles with plastic tubing with ancient dull needles you have to force into their arms.
[01:35:56.785 --> 01:35:59.367]  They use rainwater as the fluids.
[01:36:00.788 --> 01:36:03.850]  There was a smelting accident and a man got his arm burned.
[01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:13.115]  The doctor, this German doctor, this is in the Wall Street Journal, we had him on last year, gave a hip skin graft for this man.
[01:36:13.155 --> 01:36:14.415]  He got the highest award.
[01:36:14.555 --> 01:36:16.256]  They used him as propaganda purposes.
[01:36:16.636 --> 01:36:17.977]  He had his own private driver.
[01:36:17.997 --> 01:36:21.299]  His driver was in an automobile accident.
[01:36:22.930 --> 01:36:25.131]  They went to the fancy hospital.
[01:36:25.191 --> 01:36:28.712]  He said they had better MMR machines than in the finest U.S.
[01:36:28.752 --> 01:36:38.295]  and England and German hospitals, blistering white walls, special stores with premium Colby beef, prostitutes flown in.
[01:36:39.195 --> 01:36:47.437]  The Army is living in palatial five-star surroundings in the center of the cities, and he said that they don't even let you drive off the main road.
[01:36:47.457 --> 01:36:49.598]  If you do drive off the main road,
[01:36:51.221 --> 01:36:51.842]  We're good to go.
[01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:16.531]  They kill you at the death camp with malnutrition, or they shoot you in the back of the head.
[01:37:16.551 --> 01:37:19.352]  It is then sold to local butchers.
[01:37:19.452 --> 01:37:23.613]  The only real meat in the country is long ham or cumin.
[01:37:23.633 --> 01:37:36.877]  And the official Chinese government two years ago, I have the Nightline piece, admits in their own publication that they survived the Cultural Revolution, the reorganizing of the society that David Rockefeller hailed in the New York Times in 1976.
[01:37:37.057 --> 01:37:39.578]  And I've got that quote in my book.
[01:37:40.771 --> 01:37:41.792]  This is what he supports.
[01:37:42.452 --> 01:37:46.775]  By, quote, cooking dead people and mainly children in large stew pots.
[01:37:46.895 --> 01:37:48.857]  So this is the love of the New World Order.
[01:37:49.217 --> 01:37:50.238]  And I have History Channel.
[01:37:50.258 --> 01:37:57.603]  I've seen History Channel where the former head of the CIA, section chief in Asia, admits that they, quote, put Mao into power in 1949-1950.
[01:37:57.923 --> 01:37:58.803]  This is all supported.
[01:38:00.184 --> 01:38:03.827]  And so they cook them in these pots and they sell them on the streets.
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:15.926]  Vanity Fair in 99, when Madeleine Albright went there and cheered and started crying with joy at the Acrobats in the sports stadium where they do the public executions.
[01:38:16.426 --> 01:38:22.289]  She was celebrating, loved it, smiled, cried, threw flowers, got flowers, loved it a little too much.
[01:38:22.949 --> 01:38:26.491]  Vanity Fair was there and saw human flesh being sold.
[01:38:28.532 --> 01:38:30.573]  So this is serious business, but let me continue.
[01:38:30.933 --> 01:38:33.014]  Famine struck North Koreans eating children.
[01:38:33.775 --> 01:38:39.659]  Cannibalism is increasing in North Korea following another poor harvest and a big cut in international food aid.
[01:38:39.679 --> 01:38:47.525]  Well, they take all the food aid, they take the oil aid, the coal oil, fuel oil aid, and they publicly sell it to China.
[01:38:48.425 --> 01:38:48.806]  Okay?
[01:38:49.566 --> 01:38:50.547]  And none of it gets to the people.
[01:38:52.048 --> 01:39:03.176]  Aid agencies are alarmed by refugees' reports that children have been killed, killed, not shooting people that die now, and corpses cut up by people desperate for food, requests by the United Nations World Food Program,
[01:39:03.783 --> 01:39:04.904]  This is the model, folks.
[01:39:04.924 --> 01:39:14.369]  To be allowed access to farmers' markets where human meat is said to be crated have been turned down by Pyongyang, citing security reasons.
[01:39:14.569 --> 01:39:22.133]  Another caught selling human meat faces execution in a report compiled by the North Korean Refugee Assistance Fund.
[01:39:22.153 --> 01:39:27.515]  A refugee said pieces of special meat are displayed on straw mats for sale.
[01:39:27.876 --> 01:39:30.537]  People know where they came from, but they don't talk about it.
[01:39:31.263 --> 01:39:32.144]  We're good to go.
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:40:00.122]  Only as Lee, 54, said he feared that his missing grandson, age 8 and 11, had been killed for food.
[01:40:00.562 --> 01:40:04.663]  As he searched widely for them, the boys' friends said they had vanished near a market.
[01:40:05.984 --> 01:40:13.426]  Mr. Lee said police were raided a nearby restaurant, found body parts of business owners were shot and obviously sold for meat.
[01:40:14.446 --> 01:40:20.548]  Gerald Bork, WFP's representative in Beijing, said it was difficult for the organization to
[01:40:21.428 --> 01:40:28.594]  Substantiate the reports of cannibalism as they were unable to get to the markets as in any desperately poor country is something we might stumble on.
[01:40:28.634 --> 01:40:31.036]  He said, well, we've had the German doctor on another guest on.
[01:40:32.377 --> 01:40:35.640]  You're not allowed to leave the cities, but when you drive out to the markets, they are there.
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:39.884]  He's done it because he had this high-level pass, and he did see it.
[01:40:40.024 --> 01:40:46.449]  And that's when you die in a death camp, the police, the jail guards, the work camp guards sell you.
[01:40:47.290 --> 01:40:49.572]  And the number one product is opium.
[01:40:50.362 --> 01:40:51.582]  And they sell that, of course.
[01:40:51.702 --> 01:40:51.982]  U.S.
[01:40:52.042 --> 01:41:01.045]  government ships pull up, pick up the opium, bring it back here for your children to inject and become whores in the system, you know, to become prostitutes to favor their habits.
[01:41:02.105 --> 01:41:05.386]  Haiyang Yang, North Korea, sells this to our government and to others.
[01:41:06.626 --> 01:41:08.207]  So I thought you'd just want to know about that.
[01:41:09.847 --> 01:41:12.968]  The article goes on and on, but that's the wonders of big government.
[01:41:14.688 --> 01:41:17.149]  And China does it too, but it's more of a delicacy there.
[01:41:19.035 --> 01:41:22.196]  Drivers' eye movements measured to test tiredness.
[01:41:22.816 --> 01:41:28.538]  Police in Australia have started measuring eye movements to determine whether motorists are fit to drive.
[01:41:28.558 --> 01:41:41.281]  Now, the Houston Chronicle reported last year that hundreds of companies have already bought a retina scanner in businesses, and the government's doing it, where you go in and a retina scan of your eye is moving quickly, vibrating at a low level,
[01:41:42.825 --> 01:41:43.366]  We're good to go.
[01:41:43.406 --> 01:41:44.086]  We're good to go.
[01:41:59.702 --> 01:42:05.865]  A newly developed device called PupilGraph, developed in Houston, measures the contractions of the center of the eye.
[01:42:06.065 --> 01:42:09.507]  Every second, the diameter of our pupil changes to 0.3 millimeters.
[01:42:09.887 --> 01:42:16.890]  Neurologist Manfred Waltz explained to Dye Press newspaper, reveals whether drivers are too tired to concentrate on the road.
[01:42:17.471 --> 01:42:22.693]  The instrument is currently in pilot project phase, pending legislation that will make driving while tired illegal.
[01:42:24.154 --> 01:42:27.735]  But it has already helped spot a number of motorists who shouldn't have been on the road.
[01:42:27.775 --> 01:42:28.936]  See, this is Australia for you.
[01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:38.137]  One lorry driver turned out to have driven from Berlin to Rome, back to Berlin, on the Austrian-Czech border, only five hours sleep, according to Mr. Waltz.
[01:42:38.758 --> 01:42:41.720]  Driving while tired is just as dangerous as drinking and driving, see?
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:48.806]  Getting less than four hours sleep equals alcohol level in your body of 0.5 per mile, he told the paper.
[01:42:48.826 --> 01:42:54.991]  Of course, then they said there'll be problems, because some people naturally have a vibration of the eye, especially when you get above 65.
[01:42:55.532 --> 01:42:57.954]  Tired driving is extremely dangerous, both for the driver and others.
[01:42:58.755 --> 01:42:59.635]  And that's the article.
[01:42:59.656 --> 01:43:02.477]  So they're only a few years away from that here in the U.S.
[01:43:02.517 --> 01:43:03.357]  It's already being sold.
[01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:04.438]  The feds are already doing it.
[01:43:07.119 --> 01:43:09.220]  And this is the new system.
[01:43:10.538 --> 01:43:13.100]  Walmart to throw in its weight behind RFID.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.841]  These are the small trackable chips.
[01:43:15.461 --> 01:43:22.866]  Inventory management technology that uses wireless signals to track products from the factory-to-store shelves is set to win a major new ally next week from Walmart.
[01:43:22.886 --> 01:43:32.452]  See, the chips can be scanned in the truck as it drives, and then it's on you, and the same systems can track you, and they say they're going to use this for, quote, retail reasons.
[01:43:32.512 --> 01:43:34.414]  Of course, the government, of course, will get all the data.
[01:43:34.834 --> 01:43:36.495]  They already do off of your discount cards.
[01:43:37.648 --> 01:43:41.329]  The retail giant is expected to throw its weight behind RFID, Radio Frequency Identification.
[01:43:41.349 --> 01:43:42.389]  They've already built a big bunker.
[01:43:42.409 --> 01:43:45.850]  We already covered that last Friday with the feds running it there in Arkansas.
[01:43:46.251 --> 01:43:50.252]  Technology at the Retail System 2003 Industry Conference in Chicago on Tuesday.
[01:43:50.272 --> 01:43:52.072]  Of course, it's familiar with the company's plans.
[01:43:52.092 --> 01:44:01.415]  It said executives plan to make a presentation encouraging the top 100 suppliers to start using wireless inventory tracking equipment, chips affixed to products, and scanners in warehouses.
[01:44:02.711 --> 01:44:13.976]  So it's already in half the products, Walmart said, and now all the products by next year, and they are 33% of total retail sales projected by 2005 to be 40%.
[01:44:14.636 --> 01:44:16.717]  You keep buying from them, 45% by 2007.
[01:44:17.117 --> 01:44:27.161]  And in many areas of marketing, like razors, shaving cream, shampoos, dog foods, light bulbs, they have over half the total sales.
[01:44:28.201 --> 01:44:30.022]  And everyone will have to put these in now.
[01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:33.319]  And when you leave, the face scanning camera will scan.
[01:44:33.339 --> 01:44:35.420]  It will scan your name onto the product.
[01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:36.581]  This is already admitted.
[01:44:37.982 --> 01:44:40.283]  Then radio trackers will be put up around town to scan you.
[01:44:40.823 --> 01:44:44.445]  San Francisco Bay Area is now making it the law that all drivers have to have it.
[01:44:45.226 --> 01:44:46.787]  It was to just go through toll roads.
[01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:49.588]  Now it's to track and trace your movements and to start taxation.
[01:44:50.329 --> 01:44:52.830]  Folks, we're only a few years away.
[01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:56.092]  General Motors already has this standard on all new vehicles.
[01:44:56.889 --> 01:44:59.574]  This is a red-level emergency.
[01:45:00.095 --> 01:45:01.998]  Your calls and a bunch of other vital news coming up.
[01:45:02.018 --> 01:45:02.419]  Stay with me.
[01:45:06.238 --> 01:45:10.720]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:15.163]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:45:15.463 --> 01:45:16.003]  We listened.
[01:45:16.303 --> 01:45:21.306]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:45:21.566 --> 01:45:22.046]  We listened.
[01:45:22.446 --> 01:45:25.468]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:45:25.908 --> 01:45:26.448]  We listened.
[01:45:26.908 --> 01:45:30.230]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during pastures.
[01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.870]  We're good to go.
[01:45:57.804 --> 01:46:05.428]  Do you want the news?
[01:46:05.689 --> 01:46:06.889]  I mean the real news.
[01:46:07.190 --> 01:46:08.670]  Because you're sure not getting it now.
[01:46:09.051 --> 01:46:12.173]  If you'll open your ears, we'll open your eyes, and we'll open your mind.
[01:46:12.493 --> 01:46:16.295]  What did the government know about the possibility of terrorist attacks prior to 9-11?
[01:46:16.636 --> 01:46:20.238]  Is mainstream media telling you everything you should know about the war on terror?
[01:46:20.618 --> 01:46:23.460]  What is our real interest in Iraq and Saddam Hussein?
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:25.461]  For news that's in your face, and sometimes shocking,

[01:47:03.757 --> 01:47:08.079]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:08.259 --> 01:47:12.702]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:12.842 --> 01:47:17.204]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:18.605]  The New World Order.
[01:47:19.518 --> 01:47:21.680]  If you want to understand what the new
[01:47:46.038 --> 01:47:46.218]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:47:46.238 --> 01:47:47.520]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:12.564]  I'm about to go to your calls, Bob in New York and others.
[01:48:12.824 --> 01:48:14.165]  Third Hour is straight ahead.
[01:48:14.225 --> 01:48:16.266]  A ton of other news you do not want to miss.
[01:48:16.386 --> 01:48:17.146]  And more calls.
[01:48:17.706 --> 01:48:18.547]  And another guest.
[01:48:20.608 --> 01:48:29.132]  But understand, once they get the RFIDs and everything, and Walmart's going to do that by making all their distributors do it, all their manufacturers do it,
[01:48:30.086 --> 01:48:33.228]  Once they've done that, they're going to start the taxation and tracking.
[01:48:33.288 --> 01:48:41.552]  I mean, the Pentagon doesn't come out and say they're going to know every move you make, everything you say, everything you do, everything you read, everything you buy for nothing.
[01:48:42.132 --> 01:48:42.512]  Okay?
[01:48:43.193 --> 01:48:43.953]  They don't do that.
[01:48:44.393 --> 01:48:45.494]  They're already setting it up.
[01:48:45.874 --> 01:48:48.615]  The next generation of echelon times a thousand.
[01:48:49.916 --> 01:48:53.398]  Just telling you, no more Fourth Amendment of any type where the border stays wide open.
[01:48:54.855 --> 01:49:01.679]  I read those articles out of England where they're going to start now in all the major cities and nationwide, the satellite tracking and taxation.
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:03.480]  Our government's calling for it.
[01:49:03.861 --> 01:49:07.923]  They're also going to use big RFID trackers in all the cars in the Bay Area.
[01:49:08.904 --> 01:49:10.285]  It was first just for the toll roads.
[01:49:10.345 --> 01:49:15.028]  Now you have to have it to have your sticker to have your car in the city or in the Bay Area.
[01:49:15.328 --> 01:49:19.250]  They're going to track you with radio readers on the sides of the road, by your name, everything.
[01:49:19.690 --> 01:49:22.052]  Folks, this is Big Brother on steroids.
[01:49:24.053 --> 01:49:24.493]  It's here.
[01:49:24.573 --> 01:49:25.534]  It's happening now.
[01:49:26.194 --> 01:49:27.754]  You've got to boycott these people.
[01:49:27.794 --> 01:49:30.035]  You've got to say no to any corporation that does this.
[01:49:30.315 --> 01:49:36.477]  Because once the thumb scanners are in all the stores, then they pull out the service checkout lanes.
[01:49:36.758 --> 01:49:38.678]  They put in all self-serve.
[01:49:39.619 --> 01:49:40.719]  That gets rid of jobs.
[01:49:40.799 --> 01:49:41.219]  It tracks.
[01:49:41.299 --> 01:49:41.719]  It traces.
[01:49:41.779 --> 01:49:42.780]  It brings total control.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.021]  And all you're going to have at stores is security guards.
[01:49:45.041 --> 01:49:48.362]  And they're going to know everything you do.
[01:49:48.422 --> 01:49:50.022]  You're not going to have any liberty, any freedom.
[01:49:50.042 --> 01:49:51.663]  This is the opposite of America.
[01:49:52.299 --> 01:49:53.842]  Bob of New York, you're on the air.
[01:49:53.862 --> 01:49:54.464]  Thanks for holding.
[01:49:54.724 --> 01:49:55.205]  Hi, Alex.
[01:49:55.225 --> 01:49:55.866]  How are you today?
[01:49:55.886 --> 01:49:56.588]  Pretty good, my friend.
[01:49:56.748 --> 01:50:00.616]  I got a really positive message for everybody that's listening.
[01:50:01.454 --> 01:50:02.394]  Okay, you want to hear it?
[01:50:02.655 --> 01:50:02.895]  Sure.
[01:50:03.355 --> 01:50:22.784]  Well, I've been studying this stuff for almost 10 years now, and what I've realized is that when you see the government's attempt to make these moves to get into your civil liberties, to get into your right to bear arms, what it shows is a desperation.
[01:50:23.604 --> 01:50:30.750]  Their financial system is collapsing, and they're trying to push this move as fast as possible, but they're not going to make it.
[01:50:30.991 --> 01:50:35.294]  And they've got to have terror to pose as our saviors as they take our pension funds.
[01:50:35.375 --> 01:50:35.835]  Oh, boy.
[01:50:35.875 --> 01:50:41.820]  You know, I'm on a guy named Jim Sinclair's Mindset website, and he had a couple great articles.
[01:50:42.661 --> 01:50:45.684]  One is called Japan Gets It Wrong Again.
[01:50:46.364 --> 01:50:56.034]  And what they're going into is basically saying the Japanese Monetary Authority has authorized the banks to charge negative interest rates on account.
[01:50:56.495 --> 01:51:04.183]  Now this is coupled with, you know, if I've got $10,000 in the bank, they're going to charge me 5% interest just to keep it there.
[01:51:04.203 --> 01:51:05.003]  Well what does that do?
[01:51:05.064 --> 01:51:07.146]  It forces you to grab the money out of the bank.
[01:51:07.786 --> 01:51:10.189]  Then they were talking about issuing a new currency.
[01:51:10.590 --> 01:51:12.412]  These guys are completely desperate.
[01:51:12.733 --> 01:51:14.815]  Well, that's why they're coming out with the colored money.
[01:51:15.116 --> 01:51:19.421]  The Federal Reserve admits it's a training for the change to devalue the currency.
[01:51:20.202 --> 01:51:21.804]  They're never going to pull it off, Alex.
[01:51:21.844 --> 01:51:22.345]  You know why?
[01:51:23.266 --> 01:51:42.536]  Because the people that are out there hardworking, that are locked in their mind cages and thinking that all their problems and their high taxation is because of small people sitting on welfare, once you take their job away, once you take a bulk of the American people's jobs away, they know they're honest, hardworking people and they're not going to stand for it.
[01:51:42.636 --> 01:51:46.779]  Well, I'll tell you, there's a trillion bucks that's been looted from the Pentagon.
[01:51:46.799 --> 01:51:49.180]  Hardly anyone even knows about it, but it's public.
[01:51:49.818 --> 01:51:50.418]  We're good to go.
[01:52:03.217 --> 01:52:05.358]  Martha Stewart to make them think we're doing something.
[01:52:05.398 --> 01:52:06.298]  I mean, this is a joke.
[01:52:06.618 --> 01:52:16.482]  And I will tell you that that big Gallup poll two weeks ago said that 32% of the American people trust the mainstream media, while the trust of the alternative media is at 80-plus percent.
[01:52:16.803 --> 01:52:17.323]  There you go.
[01:52:17.383 --> 01:52:18.323]  What does that say for them?
[01:52:18.343 --> 01:52:20.664]  The Pentagon's morale is the lowest it's ever been.
[01:52:20.684 --> 01:52:22.885]  That's because they know this is a lie and a fraud.
[01:52:23.225 --> 01:52:24.746]  Everybody in government isn't bad.
[01:52:24.786 --> 01:52:27.687]  They've been compartmentalized, and now they're learning the truth.
[01:52:28.147 --> 01:52:30.248]  And millions of people are standing up and speaking out.
[01:52:30.528 --> 01:52:31.128]  They're waking up.
[01:52:31.448 --> 01:52:34.949]  You know, another article here is the emperor fiddles while Rome burns.
[01:52:35.009 --> 01:52:35.749]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:52:35.789 --> 01:52:37.310]  I'll let you finish them in the other hour.
[01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:38.830]  Next hour, third hour coming up.
[01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:42.551]  And more of your calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:52:43.071 --> 01:52:44.492]  Third hour, please stay with us.
[01:52:45.072 --> 01:52:47.032]  If your station doesn't carry the third hour, they really should.
[01:52:47.052 --> 01:52:48.373]  But I appreciate all our affiliates.
[01:52:48.773 --> 01:52:49.733]  Third hour coming up.
[01:52:49.873 --> 01:52:52.894]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com are the websites.
[01:52:55.214 --> 01:52:58.335]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:52:58.615 --> 01:53:02.056]  The Sangian 505P shortwave radio is the answer.
[01:53:02.596 --> 01:53:12.660]  Featuring continuous tuning for all shortwave frequency... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.809]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.489 --> 01:53:22.529]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:23.250 --> 01:53:24.350]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.810]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.590 --> 01:53:27.490]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:32.111]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.331 --> 01:53:36.452]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:39.692 --> 01:53:42.293]  The government attacks us on many different fronts.
[01:53:42.493 --> 01:53:44.673]  Psychologically, spiritually, financially.
[01:53:44.913 --> 01:53:46.014]  They try to get us dependent.
[01:53:46.574 --> 01:53:48.554]  Get us into their compact city control grids.
[01:53:50.522 --> 01:54:00.669]  Now, more and more children, the government's telling them that, oh, your child has disabilities, you've got a special school for them, special public school, but then basically they're just prisons for your children.
[01:54:00.689 --> 01:54:05.772]  We've got a woman coming up to talk about this and some of the abuses that are going on.
[01:54:07.033 --> 01:54:18.400]  Also, I've got more on the lies by the government concerning Iraq and the situation there, how the lies are now coming out, people are now beginning to learn of this en masse.
[01:54:19.102 --> 01:54:26.950]  The number of cases now or potential cases of the monkeypox has grown dramatically.
[01:54:26.970 --> 01:54:32.115]  They're talking about quarantining all the pet stores and shutting down whole areas.
[01:54:33.161 --> 01:54:37.504]  There's some interesting news, though, out of the Supreme Court, some of the developments there.
[01:54:37.624 --> 01:54:43.188]  A new SARS outbreak feared at a hospital in Toronto.
[01:54:43.208 --> 01:54:49.452]  The EU wants an Internet sales tax and is trying to drag our government along with it.
[01:54:50.052 --> 01:54:50.572]  The U.S.
[01:54:50.612 --> 01:54:54.475]  plans a ring of bases for quick strikes to go in and take over sovereign nations.
[01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:58.436]  It's all coming up in this hour.
[01:54:58.497 --> 01:55:02.384]  Right now, let's go back to Bob in New York and get another point he wanted to make.
[01:55:02.425 --> 01:55:03.006]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:55:03.743 --> 01:55:05.284]  Alex, I've got this article.
[01:55:05.384 --> 01:55:06.524]  I'll read it real quick.
[01:55:06.584 --> 01:55:07.885]  It's really short.
[01:55:08.986 --> 01:55:11.687]  It's called The Emperor Fiddling While Rome Burns.
[01:55:12.187 --> 01:55:21.792]  The Federal Reserve is indulging in PR as never before and pussyfooting on the money supply issue, while the velocity of money is in chronic decline.
[01:55:22.373 --> 01:55:27.155]  As did the Emperor Nero, the Fed seems content to fiddle while Rome burns.
[01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:29.175]  The following chart from the St.
[01:55:29.215 --> 01:55:42.359]  Louis Fed shows a slowdown not only in money growth, but in the velocity of money, which is defined as the number of times the money supply circulates through the economy during a specified period of time.
[01:55:42.819 --> 01:55:47.761]  Without a doubt, this is a lethal combination for GDP growth.
[01:55:48.201 --> 01:55:52.043]  What's amazing is people are getting smart and they're hanging on to their money.
[01:55:52.443 --> 01:55:55.264]  Well, if money doesn't circulate, Alex, what is it worth?
[01:55:55.979 --> 01:55:56.339]  Nothing.
[01:55:56.439 --> 01:55:59.400]  Well, also, yesterday I read the Wall Street Journal article.
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:04.581]  We're in tech construction, across-the-board manufacturing.
[01:56:05.221 --> 01:56:08.862]  CEOs are dumping the stock in their companies during this rally.
[01:56:09.482 --> 01:56:11.742]  That portends badly for earnings.
[01:56:12.302 --> 01:56:15.023]  We know that manufactured goods sales are down.
[01:56:16.783 --> 01:56:19.704]  We know that service industry sales are way down.
[01:56:20.704 --> 01:56:22.124]  All the key indicators are bad.
[01:56:22.744 --> 01:56:24.185]  And remember, this is all on purpose.
[01:56:24.385 --> 01:56:25.545]  The Davos, Switzerland...
[01:56:26.275 --> 01:56:42.191]  World Economic Forum said, they said this almost four years ago, that they wanted to destroy the dollar, they want to slow the economy down so people can't physically pay their debts off, so that they can have a massive consolidation.
[01:56:42.752 --> 01:56:44.013]  So it's all about control.
[01:56:44.073 --> 01:56:46.396]  Does this particular writer agree with that analysis?
[01:56:47.282 --> 01:56:48.985]  Oh, very much so, in fact.
[01:56:49.145 --> 01:57:02.343]  But what he also says is they've been running test models at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City in regards to a global financial collapse and what is going to be their response.
[01:57:03.035 --> 01:57:16.985]  And I just laugh because I think that all their tools, their massive derivatives positions, will not prop this up before the American people and the people of the world, for that matter, wake up and say... My friends, they don't want to prop it up.
[01:57:17.025 --> 01:57:21.609]  They just are waiting, trying to forestall it so they can get their whole police state in line.
[01:57:22.771 --> 01:57:23.311]  You watch.
[01:57:23.432 --> 01:57:32.578]  With an economic collapse, we'll be accompanied by military-industrial complex terror attacks to legitimize the government as the savior during the crisis.
[01:57:33.199 --> 01:57:34.920]  Boy, I hope we just wake up in the meantime.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.463]  I want to send that positive message is that they're losing it.
[01:57:39.963 --> 01:57:40.564]  Well, it is positive.
[01:57:40.584 --> 01:57:44.427]  They're getting more and more insane, and they're losing it, and they don't know what to do.
[01:57:44.467 --> 01:57:46.048]  That's what I think.
[01:57:46.833 --> 01:57:47.454]  Absolutely.
[01:57:47.534 --> 01:57:49.115]  Thank you for the call, Bob.
[01:57:49.175 --> 01:57:50.016]  Really good points.
[01:57:50.036 --> 01:57:51.617]  We've got a guest coming up and more news.
[01:57:52.037 --> 01:57:52.618]  And your calls.
[01:57:52.678 --> 01:57:54.119]  Guests will be only on in about 10 minutes.
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:56.421]  We'll get to the callers that are patiently holding.
[01:57:57.362 --> 01:58:02.566]  Don't forget to join us on air.
[01:58:02.586 --> 01:58:02.886]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:02.906 --> 01:58:03.327]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:03.347 --> 01:58:07.230]  What do you think about all the articles I've been mentioning?
[01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:08.271]  All these different stories.
[01:58:08.331 --> 01:58:10.592]  I mean, the Globals are a bunch of sick freaks.
[01:58:10.953 --> 01:58:11.673]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:11.713 --> 01:58:12.334]  Please stay with me.
[01:58:16.551 --> 01:58:23.935]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:58:24.195 --> 01:58:28.937]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:58:29.157 --> 01:58:34.820]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:39.582]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:58:39.803 --> 01:58:46.946]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:58:46.966 --> 01:58:51.509]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:54.190]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:58:54.410 --> 01:59:01.134]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:16.061]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.421 --> 02:00:22.145]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:00:22.425 --> 02:00:27.549]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:00:27.889 --> 02:00:37.175]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:00:37.515 --> 02:00:42.477]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:00:42.797 --> 02:00:46.799]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:00:46.999 --> 02:00:51.741]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:00:52.141 --> 02:00:58.003]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:00:58.483 --> 02:01:01.806]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:01.826 --> 02:01:02.967]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:27.717 --> 02:01:30.618]  About half of America isn't even on the Internet.
[02:01:32.418 --> 02:01:33.478]  Doesn't own a computer.
[02:01:33.939 --> 02:01:35.599]  Don't surf the World Wide Web.
[02:01:37.519 --> 02:01:43.901]  But even if you don't have a computer, you should be against Internet sales taxes.
[02:01:45.321 --> 02:01:46.282]  Because the U.N.
[02:01:46.502 --> 02:01:47.602]  owns the domain names.
[02:01:48.182 --> 02:01:52.243]  They say you don't own your domain names, like Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:54.668 --> 02:02:03.533]  And they say that they're going to control content, not just tax it, and that it's going to be a global body that taxes it, setting up a global tax.
[02:02:03.593 --> 02:02:04.853]  That's why this is so dangerous.
[02:02:05.253 --> 02:02:06.414]  Just one facet of it.
[02:02:07.034 --> 02:02:13.738]  And I've got this article here, and we're going to be covering that a little bit later in the show.
[02:02:13.818 --> 02:02:22.402]  Also a new SARS outbreak, more on the monkeypox and that crisis that's brewing.
[02:02:23.228 --> 02:02:23.789]  We're good to go.
[02:02:48.493 --> 02:02:48.853]  We're good to go.
[02:02:48.873 --> 02:02:49.414]  We're good to go.
[02:02:49.514 --> 02:02:49.894]  We're good to go.
[02:03:17.447 --> 02:03:23.810]  The smallest thing gets you sent to the principal's office, gets you locked up in these little time-out rooms.
[02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:38.496]  And joining me is Kelly Fletcher, and her 7-year-old son is partially deaf, and she doesn't think that he needs to be in this special class environment where they lock kids up, and she says her child has never been in trouble.
[02:03:39.356 --> 02:03:40.957]  Kelly Fletcher, thanks for coming on the show.
[02:03:42.672 --> 02:03:49.698]  Tell us about how your child got into this part of the public school and why you're upset about what's happening.
[02:03:50.178 --> 02:04:02.128]  Well, in February, his home school had approached me and said that the accommodations that they were using on Dante was not helping him to academically progress.
[02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:06.672]  We've known about the hearing problem all along.
[02:04:08.041 --> 02:04:12.582]  Just wanting him to get the proper help, I was open to whatever options they gave me.
[02:04:13.283 --> 02:04:27.387]  One of the options was a class in the North Shore School District at one of the other schools that's close by that this class is a little bit smaller in size and they can give the children a little more intense one-on-one.
[02:04:28.947 --> 02:04:32.288]  That sounded great because I want my son to succeed in school.
[02:04:32.648 --> 02:04:34.909]  Then they told me, there's like
[02:04:35.888 --> 02:04:40.349]  Just a couple kids in there with a behavior problem, which then struck my problem.
[02:04:40.409 --> 02:04:43.850]  I'm like, hey, I don't... So this is a discussion of special education.
[02:04:44.691 --> 02:04:47.952]  And they're broadening the definitions now.
[02:04:49.172 --> 02:04:50.072]  I've read the statistics.
[02:04:50.092 --> 02:04:53.173]  They're putting kids in who supposedly have ADD.
[02:04:53.713 --> 02:04:55.474]  Now they get a subpar education.
[02:04:55.494 --> 02:04:56.614]  The curriculum is lowered.
[02:04:57.054 --> 02:04:59.095]  And you're next to some kid who's a psychopath.
[02:04:59.742 --> 02:05:00.943]  It'll corrupt your children.
[02:05:00.983 --> 02:05:10.390]  It's a horrible system, but they get federal funds to expand the special education, and some schools, only one-third are in special ed.
[02:05:11.031 --> 02:05:16.435]  So this is really part of dumbing the kids down, and all your child has, you say, never had a behavioral problem, never... No.
[02:05:16.815 --> 02:05:20.398]  So they weren't honest to you about what type of system this really is.
[02:05:20.698 --> 02:05:22.939]  Yeah, no, that's what promoted me.
[02:05:22.959 --> 02:05:26.942]  You know, when he came home and told me, this was only nine days after attending a class.
[02:05:26.962 --> 02:05:28.964]  I'm hearing little by little new things.
[02:05:29.854 --> 02:05:35.256]  He was locked in the room, and then I look at his progress report for that day, and it says that he met standards.
[02:05:35.336 --> 02:05:36.036]  It was a good day.
[02:05:36.777 --> 02:05:38.017]  That rose flags right there.
[02:05:38.037 --> 02:05:39.778]  That's like covering a black eye with makeup.
[02:05:40.118 --> 02:05:41.318]  No, can't have that.
[02:05:41.358 --> 02:05:42.879]  Called the police and reported it to them.
[02:05:44.759 --> 02:05:50.141]  And it took them about three days to get there because it wasn't considered a crisis situation.
[02:05:50.581 --> 02:05:56.003]  But in the meantime, I kept my son out of school until I got some kind of response.
[02:05:56.843 --> 02:05:58.104]  So you called the police?
[02:06:00.288 --> 02:06:00.849]  Yes, I did.
[02:06:01.729 --> 02:06:05.312]  And what did you, I mean, did you say that this was, what, cruel and unusual, or what did you say?
[02:06:05.332 --> 02:06:06.733]  Oh, I was just, I was flabbergasted.
[02:06:06.773 --> 02:06:10.155]  You know, my son says he was locked in this room and the lights were turned off.
[02:06:10.996 --> 02:06:19.402]  And I didn't think that any place could, in a public school, could perform this sort of discipline, especially without the help of the parents.
[02:06:19.422 --> 02:06:24.846]  The Denver Post has reported, 2020 and 91 reported, they locked kids in small boxes.
[02:06:25.446 --> 02:06:28.989]  It's all part of a psychological operation.
[02:06:29.009 --> 02:06:29.129]  Uh-huh.
[02:06:29.847 --> 02:06:33.439]  Do they even have the credentials to be performing psychological
[02:06:34.831 --> 02:06:35.931]  Tactics on these children.
[02:06:36.192 --> 02:06:37.112]  Oh, that's a good point.
[02:06:37.212 --> 02:06:41.073]  No, they don't have it to demand Ritalin or Prozac or any of this.
[02:06:41.113 --> 02:06:44.774]  So to your son, seven, you say in the article, never been in trouble.
[02:06:45.915 --> 02:06:49.996]  And so why did your son tell you they stuck him in there?
[02:06:50.396 --> 02:06:56.198]  Well, I guess being new to the class, he's in with kids that do have behavior problems, and they were teasing him.
[02:06:56.478 --> 02:07:00.420]  Now, my son also has two different colored eyes, which has always drawn a lot of attention to him.
[02:07:01.220 --> 02:07:04.141]  Some of it's been negative and some of it's been, well, most of it's positive.
[02:07:04.864 --> 02:07:05.925]  But, you know, kids are cruel.
[02:07:06.525 --> 02:07:07.406]  So, anyways, you've been there.
[02:07:07.426 --> 02:07:08.707]  You know, that's very interesting.
[02:07:09.207 --> 02:07:12.430]  Do you know what that means when a human has two different colored eyes?
[02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:12.970]  Yes.
[02:07:13.090 --> 02:07:16.953]  It's a gene that's been discovered, and it's called Wardenburg.
[02:07:18.334 --> 02:07:21.556]  And there's symptoms with the gene that you can display.
[02:07:21.576 --> 02:07:24.799]  Well, that's, I mean, it's actually an incredibly exceptional person.
[02:07:25.199 --> 02:07:30.283]  It means it's a generally, in almost every case, it is a twin that did not divide.
[02:07:31.094 --> 02:07:31.254]  Yeah.
[02:07:31.474 --> 02:07:32.654]  Did you know that?
[02:07:33.035 --> 02:07:34.255]  I mean, I'm just saying it's interesting.
[02:07:34.595 --> 02:07:38.876]  A lot of times they're very exceptional people, though they do have some problems.
[02:07:38.976 --> 02:07:39.336]  Oh, yeah.
[02:07:39.436 --> 02:07:40.617]  A lot of geniuses.
[02:07:43.137 --> 02:07:43.837]  But, I mean, go ahead.
[02:07:44.057 --> 02:07:44.678]  Please continue.
[02:07:44.858 --> 02:07:45.118]  Yes.
[02:07:45.258 --> 02:07:52.500]  So, anyways, the kids were, you know, teasing him and being a little insecure just moving to the school and putting in the factor of different colored eyes.
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:57.821]  Now that he's at the school, he's had some negative feedback from his eyes from some of the children.
[02:07:58.382 --> 02:08:00.484]  He starts to tell the children, stop looking at me.
[02:08:00.564 --> 02:08:09.290]  So the teacher got mad because I guess at this point in the time the children were coming back from recess and it was called quiet downtime, which I didn't know about this.
[02:08:09.330 --> 02:08:16.495]  He had to go grab a happy toy or a pillow and lay down on the ground like a two-year-old, which I'm now upset because my son's almost eight.
[02:08:18.757 --> 02:08:21.739]  This hurts the children to put them in special education.
[02:08:21.759 --> 02:08:23.861]  They're trying to widen it, and I'm glad you noticed this.
[02:08:24.835 --> 02:08:25.455]  Yes, yes.
[02:08:25.535 --> 02:08:31.239]  And there's too many disabilities in together at once, and you need to be specialized in one disability.
[02:08:31.259 --> 02:08:35.601]  You can't treat an autistic children and then know about a hearing-impaired child.
[02:08:35.981 --> 02:08:37.843]  You don't have the knowledge for both.
[02:08:38.243 --> 02:08:45.307]  And generally, the special ed teacher, and not all of them, I'm not knocking all of them, but usually it's somebody who's washed out of the other classes.
[02:08:46.247 --> 02:08:53.932]  Yeah, well, as far as I understand, this person is just getting their first teaching position, so... Ah, I see.
[02:08:54.992 --> 02:08:57.493]  Well, so you're going to get your child, I would imagine, out of here.
[02:08:57.673 --> 02:08:58.234]  I'm trying.
[02:08:58.254 --> 02:09:05.477]  You thought it was some special curriculum to help him, but you found out it was really where they just stick to all the kids.
[02:09:05.618 --> 02:09:16.603]  No, actually this class is geared for children with behavior problems, and I was also told two times that children do not come to this class unless they are referred with behavior problems.
[02:09:17.944 --> 02:09:19.965]  So what did they tell you when they referred your child?
[02:09:20.735 --> 02:09:27.658]  That it was just the smaller class size that he would be able to get a little more of the one-on-one that he needed, you know, due to his hearing loss.
[02:09:27.798 --> 02:09:31.740]  It's hard for him to follow directions in the class and participate like all the rest of the children.
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:38.062]  Now, the news says here that your son didn't have any record of being in trouble before.
[02:09:38.082 --> 02:09:38.122]  No.
[02:09:38.863 --> 02:09:40.563]  And then now suddenly all this is happening.
[02:09:40.763 --> 02:09:41.023]  Yeah.
[02:09:41.404 --> 02:09:43.304]  And you're in Washington State.
[02:09:43.604 --> 02:09:43.785]  Yes.
[02:09:45.005 --> 02:09:49.547]  Well, I have to tell you, that's one of the worst states for all of this weird social engineering, so...
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:52.265]  Is your son out of the class now?
[02:09:52.285 --> 02:09:53.830]  I am trying really hard.
[02:09:53.850 --> 02:09:54.793]  I'm just new to this.
[02:09:57.833 --> 02:10:02.035]  The reason I took the steps for the news is because it became more of a power control.
[02:10:02.055 --> 02:10:07.098]  You know, I'm like, hey, I got a doctor's note, and I was told, hey, you don't get to choose where he's placed.
[02:10:07.158 --> 02:10:10.000]  You know, I'm like, hold on, this is no longer about helping my son.
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:12.962]  It's more about, oh, we're going to do what we want to do with your child.
[02:10:13.042 --> 02:10:21.326]  Well, it's called Goals 2000, and a subdirective of it is all children by the fifth grade, they're already doing computer testing, federally paid for.
[02:10:21.346 --> 02:10:25.269]  The government will decide what trade school or what you're going to be.
[02:10:26.121 --> 02:10:28.223]  And then you'll have to have that letter of accreditation.
[02:10:28.263 --> 02:10:30.925]  It's the Soviet model or the old Europe model.
[02:10:31.305 --> 02:10:35.649]  You'll have to have a letter of accreditation for what college you can attend and what you can be.
[02:10:36.329 --> 02:10:40.313]  So already they're doing it by pushing the kids into these schools.
[02:10:41.714 --> 02:10:44.916]  So you have a teacher conference or senatorial hearing.
[02:10:45.297 --> 02:10:46.998]  This area will help him.
[02:10:47.038 --> 02:10:52.282]  You didn't know the school got tens of thousands of federal dollars, I'm sure, as a motive to do this.
[02:10:52.663 --> 02:10:55.585]  Now he's in there and having problems, and they want to keep him locked up in there.
[02:10:56.576 --> 02:10:56.896]  Yeah.
[02:10:56.976 --> 02:11:03.300]  Have you ever thought about homeschooling, even if your son had to, or putting him into a Christian school, telling him your situation?
[02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:04.241]  You know, that would be great.
[02:11:04.261 --> 02:11:05.842]  The thing is, is I'm a single parent.
[02:11:05.882 --> 02:11:07.943]  I'm also in college, and I'm working.
[02:11:08.043 --> 02:11:10.125]  So, you know, this is at a bad time.
[02:11:10.425 --> 02:11:11.646]  They've broken down the society.
[02:11:11.666 --> 02:11:13.307]  Let me tell you what these special ed classes do.
[02:11:14.167 --> 02:11:16.689]  They will try to hop your kid up on drugs in the next few years.
[02:11:16.729 --> 02:11:18.111]  The kids are going to keep teasing him.
[02:11:18.611 --> 02:11:20.453]  He'll start having behavioral problems.
[02:11:20.873 --> 02:11:24.116]  And before you're done, they're going to send CPS after you.
[02:11:24.156 --> 02:11:29.161]  Also, a large portion of kids that go in these classes are eventually kidnapped by Child Protective Services.
[02:11:29.501 --> 02:11:32.404]  Oh, see, you know, all these things have already struck me.
[02:11:32.464 --> 02:11:33.826]  I'm getting him out of this class.
[02:11:33.886 --> 02:11:35.127]  Oh, wait, this is already happening?
[02:11:35.727 --> 02:11:37.868]  Well, no, these things have already crossed my mind.
[02:11:38.609 --> 02:11:42.350]  But don't be confrontational with these headheads on power trips.
[02:11:42.651 --> 02:11:48.593]  Just calmly go sign the form, withdraw your son, move if you have to to another school district, start over.
[02:11:49.834 --> 02:11:52.976]  Don't make a lot of smoke, though, because you're a single mother.
[02:11:52.996 --> 02:11:55.837]  They'll figure that they're like hyenas.
[02:11:55.937 --> 02:11:59.119]  They'll figure that they can attack you because you're with young easier.
[02:11:59.139 --> 02:12:01.200]  I keep recording our last conversation.
[02:12:05.004 --> 02:12:11.610]  I knew that from day one, when I found out that there was a lie, that I had to take different steps in this whole... Oh, they're total liars.
[02:12:11.650 --> 02:12:12.351]  They're total, yes.
[02:12:12.491 --> 02:12:20.759]  Yeah, so you know, what I did is when I came into our meeting and I had no knowledge of anything about this class, I said, I hope you don't mind, I'm tape recording this.
[02:12:20.779 --> 02:12:23.762]  Turn the tape recorder on and then start confronting them about the situation.
[02:12:23.782 --> 02:12:26.124]  Why did you tell me that this class was for the academics?
[02:12:26.144 --> 02:12:26.525]  That's right.
[02:12:26.565 --> 02:12:28.426]  You get on the offensive about this point.
[02:12:28.446 --> 02:12:29.928]  And then I sent it off to the investigators.
[02:12:30.601 --> 02:12:31.302]  To an Olympia.
[02:12:31.542 --> 02:12:35.004]  But now, I mean, now that you let them know, now we'll just quietly pull him out.
[02:12:36.384 --> 02:12:39.786]  If you've got family with another address, say he lives there, do whatever you have to.
[02:12:40.347 --> 02:12:41.507]  Get him into another school district.
[02:12:41.527 --> 02:12:42.748]  Be very quiet about this.
[02:12:43.468 --> 02:12:46.150]  And just tell him he's going to have to cope with it.
[02:12:46.170 --> 02:12:47.871]  He doesn't want to go back into that mind control class.
[02:12:48.824 --> 02:12:54.128]  Yeah, no, I'm trying to get him into a school that is geared for children with hard of hearing.
[02:12:54.228 --> 02:12:55.068]  He doesn't belong there.
[02:12:55.088 --> 02:12:57.390]  That's the way to go, yeah, school for the hearing impaired.
[02:12:57.410 --> 02:12:59.811]  Well, I found him an advocate just at the last minute.
[02:12:59.872 --> 02:13:00.092]  Good.
[02:13:00.352 --> 02:13:02.073]  Kelly Fletcher, Godspeed.
[02:13:02.573 --> 02:13:03.374]  We'll pray for you.
[02:13:03.394 --> 02:13:03.954]  Thank you.
[02:13:04.074 --> 02:13:05.895]  I hope everything goes well with your son.
[02:13:05.915 --> 02:13:08.317]  I'm sorry you had to learn the hard way how evil these people are.
[02:13:08.517 --> 02:13:11.119]  Well, God's been guiding me through this, so it's okay.
[02:13:11.139 --> 02:13:11.719]  Well, thank you.
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:12.640]  Thank you, Kelly.
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:13.200]  Thank you.
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:13.921]  I'll be right back.
[02:13:18.041 --> 02:13:18.562]  It's here.
[02:13:18.842 --> 02:13:19.542]  It's powerful.
[02:13:19.842 --> 02:13:28.429]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[02:13:28.729 --> 02:13:30.570]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:32.912]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[02:13:33.172 --> 02:13:37.453]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[02:13:37.713 --> 02:13:43.434]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[02:13:43.614 --> 02:13:45.375]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[02:13:45.535 --> 02:13:48.775]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[02:13:48.955 --> 02:13:50.516]  Get the powerful Berkey now.

[02:17:16.756 --> 02:17:19.478]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:17:20.079 --> 02:17:26.344]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:26.585 --> 02:17:29.767]  Alright, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[02:17:29.927 --> 02:17:34.832]  Now I'm going to get back into this British scientist saying the chance of Armageddon is 50-50.
[02:17:35.472 --> 02:17:36.833]  Because this is what I'm concerned about.
[02:17:36.853 --> 02:17:38.955]  Genetically engineered weapons the government has.
[02:17:38.975 --> 02:17:44.300]  How stuff's already been released from bioweapons labs, they say, by accident.
[02:17:45.351 --> 02:17:50.316]  And these different threats and how the globalists are using those threats saying the answer is a new world order.
[02:17:50.956 --> 02:17:54.880]  That's coming up more on the internet taxes they want to do as a global tax.
[02:17:55.340 --> 02:17:58.983]  But right now, let's talk to Philip in Missouri, then Ron, Charles, and others.
[02:17:59.364 --> 02:18:00.224]  Philip, you're on the air.
[02:18:00.264 --> 02:18:00.885]  Thanks for holding.
[02:18:02.066 --> 02:18:03.347]  Mr. Jones, how are you all doing?
[02:18:03.667 --> 02:18:04.288]  Fantastic.
[02:18:06.570 --> 02:18:09.993]  I was watching less than a couple weeks ago.
[02:18:10.533 --> 02:18:12.175]  I was watching a thing on the History Channel.
[02:18:13.479 --> 02:18:35.006]  On restaurants, they were talking about the drive-thru windows, and it caught my eye because they were talking about maybe a next step, and some of the McDonald's restaurants were already doing it, is having the little cards, and they would ask you if you just want to take it off the card while they're out there on the, you're not even heading in cash anymore.
[02:18:35.046 --> 02:18:41.808]  It's just done through the... Yes, and then major chains are going to go away from cash, phasing it out.
[02:18:42.583 --> 02:18:43.164]  Yeah.
[02:18:43.364 --> 02:18:47.208]  Now, I work for Taco Bell, and I'm saying this is freaking me out.
[02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:52.873]  Because, I mean, they're trying to say, well, it's going to speed up the speed of service.
[02:18:53.193 --> 02:18:55.556]  And then there's going to be problems.
[02:18:57.208 --> 02:18:57.889]  We're good to go.
[02:19:22.567 --> 02:19:24.509]  And maybe one person that cleans stuff up.
[02:19:24.849 --> 02:19:26.350]  It'll all be automated.
[02:19:26.390 --> 02:19:28.451]  Doesn't that sound like delicious food to you?
[02:19:28.852 --> 02:19:31.673]  Oh, you know, I already hate my job the way it is.
[02:19:32.594 --> 02:19:33.655]  It's just going to make it worse.
[02:19:35.256 --> 02:19:38.798]  It's just going to make the job worse for the people that are actually making the food.
[02:19:38.998 --> 02:19:42.001]  How's that Starlink corn they put in the Taco Bell tacos?
[02:19:42.621 --> 02:19:45.523]  It's nasty and it hurts the health.
[02:19:46.398 --> 02:19:47.860]  Of the taco?
[02:19:48.220 --> 02:19:52.124]  Well, it's corn that bugs won't eat because it has a natural pesticide.
[02:19:52.424 --> 02:19:54.306]  What's wrong with us to let us eat that?
[02:19:55.548 --> 02:19:56.869]  A lot of things are wrong with us.
[02:19:57.430 --> 02:19:58.671]  It hurts my diabetes.
[02:19:59.252 --> 02:20:00.393]  I'll tell you that right now.
[02:20:00.473 --> 02:20:05.378]  The corn actually hurts the pancreatic secretions.
[02:20:06.252 --> 02:20:09.495]  Oh, I just know they weren't supposed to put it in there and got caught doing it.
[02:20:10.456 --> 02:20:16.002]  Yeah, well, there's a lot of things that are wrong with food, not only at Taco Bell, but many other fast food restaurants.
[02:20:16.022 --> 02:20:19.165]  But don't worry, they're going to start irradiating all the school children's meat.
[02:20:19.645 --> 02:20:22.388]  Now they can take rotten meat and irradiate it, and it'll be good to eat.
[02:20:23.209 --> 02:20:32.572]  I'm quite wondering if some of the health problems that we have is because of, I mean, cancer and diabetes and everything else, because of some of the stuff that we eat.
[02:20:32.852 --> 02:20:39.854]  Well, they admit they've got the deadly cancer virus that was in the polio shot right up until the 80s, and now they've found it magically.
[02:20:40.254 --> 02:20:45.715]  Other types of cancer and vaccines that don't even have a mammal involved in the production, they're just wondering how it's getting in there.
[02:20:45.775 --> 02:20:47.276]  But eat taking your shots.
[02:20:47.356 --> 02:20:48.036]  It's good for you.
[02:20:48.456 --> 02:20:50.557]  Yeah, but now they've got this.
[02:20:50.577 --> 02:20:55.240]  You can't even go to a pet store and buy any type of animal because you might get this monkey pox thing.
[02:20:55.701 --> 02:20:57.182]  Oh, they've got to train you.
[02:20:57.242 --> 02:21:04.526]  They can shut down industries whenever they want and lock down roads and have red alerts for your safety.
[02:21:04.886 --> 02:21:10.030]  Well, the funny thing about the monkey pox is they said it happened to show up in this prairie dog.
[02:21:10.610 --> 02:21:13.572]  Now, I'm originally from western Kansas where they have prairie dogs.
[02:21:14.119 --> 02:21:22.624]  Oh, they think they had prairie dogs in a cage with this giant Asian rat, and the rat had the monkey pox, and that's how it got spread.
[02:21:23.624 --> 02:21:24.565]  It's nuts.
[02:21:24.585 --> 02:21:26.766]  I think they're just monkeying around with our health.
[02:21:28.447 --> 02:21:31.068]  Well, it certainly gets us all afraid of smallpox.
[02:21:31.108 --> 02:21:35.511]  Now, see, see, it can spread, and now maybe we should go ahead and take the shot.
[02:21:35.551 --> 02:21:40.893]  It'll keep us safe, and, oh, there's West Nile that Rumsfeld just so happened to give to Saddam in 83, and
[02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:44.481]  Right up until 1990, our government did.
[02:21:44.861 --> 02:21:46.381]  Oh, there just so happens to be SARS.
[02:21:46.461 --> 02:21:49.142]  It looks like it was genetically engineered, but that's okay.
[02:21:49.162 --> 02:21:50.202]  The government will save us.
[02:21:50.602 --> 02:21:53.383]  Yeah, SARS just showed up in Missouri again, too.
[02:21:53.403 --> 02:22:01.245]  It's all part of the fear, all part of strengthening the mental health and public health systems for tyranny.
[02:22:01.265 --> 02:22:02.846]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[02:22:02.926 --> 02:22:03.666]  Great points, Phillip.
[02:22:04.126 --> 02:22:05.787]  Ron in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[02:22:05.827 --> 02:22:06.447]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:22:07.611 --> 02:22:08.292]  Good to talk to you.
[02:22:08.332 --> 02:22:08.672]  You there?
[02:22:09.013 --> 02:22:09.413]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:09.493 --> 02:22:11.195]  Got a couple questions for you real quick.
[02:22:11.636 --> 02:22:12.057]  Okay.
[02:22:12.517 --> 02:22:18.725]  One, had you heard about the Oklahoma City Council considering a resolution against the Patriot Act?
[02:22:19.886 --> 02:22:23.431]  Heard it on the radio, the car radio this morning on a local Oklahoma City...
[02:22:24.221 --> 02:22:25.042]  Radio station.
[02:22:25.322 --> 02:22:36.729]  I know that a talk show host named Lan Lampere, I've met on his show about five times and we've called for it, and it's one of the big 50,000 waters there, AM.
[02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:39.131]  I know he had called for it a few weeks ago.
[02:22:39.831 --> 02:22:40.752]  Tell me about it when we get back.
[02:22:40.792 --> 02:22:41.592]  No, I didn't hear about that.
[02:22:42.092 --> 02:22:43.173]  That's a conservative area.
[02:22:43.193 --> 02:22:44.074]  That'd be a major victory.
[02:22:44.814 --> 02:22:47.175]  Stay there, and I'll hear more about this, Ron.
[02:22:47.195 --> 02:22:48.595]  We'll get your other question, too.
[02:22:48.655 --> 02:22:51.996]  Then we'll go to Charles and the others that are patiently holding.
[02:22:52.497 --> 02:22:54.217]  Full free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:54.357 --> 02:22:58.718]  There's a lot more coming up.
[02:23:00.299 --> 02:23:01.859]  But please, stay with us.
[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:03.880]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:23:06.201 --> 02:23:07.121]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.601 --> 02:23:09.222]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:10.122 --> 02:23:12.823]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:16.522 --> 02:23:17.082]  Hello, buddy.

[02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:46.772]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:48.433 --> 02:23:49.855]  Alert issued as U.S.
[02:23:49.935 --> 02:23:51.836]  monkeypox cases grow to 37.
[02:23:53.858 --> 02:23:54.979]  More on that coming up.
[02:23:56.219 --> 02:24:07.328]  Of course, your calls here momentarily, and some news on the false information they put out for the war, world taxation for the Internet by the United Nations, and much more.
[02:24:07.348 --> 02:24:09.510]  Before we go back to Ron Charles, Mark, and others...
[02:24:10.365 --> 02:24:12.247]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:24:12.687 --> 02:24:14.088]  My ninth film is now out.
[02:24:14.169 --> 02:24:16.230]  Believe me, you're really missing something if you don't get it.
[02:24:17.091 --> 02:24:18.873]  It is two hours, 37 minutes long.
[02:24:18.893 --> 02:24:25.479]  Covers Patriot Act 1 and 2, Ashcroft's Lies, Homeland Security, Total Information Awareness Network, and Stunning Detail.
[02:24:26.798 --> 02:24:27.378]  We're good to go.
[02:24:53.996 --> 02:25:11.332]  $25.95.
[02:24:55.097 --> 02:25:11.332]  But if you order three or more of any of my nine titles, my nine videos, they drop down to $20 apiece, and you're authorized and encouraged to make copies of the videos for non-profit educational purposes, to get them out to your friends and family, and to tap into the grassroots power of the American people.
[02:25:11.352 --> 02:25:12.633]  So the ball is in your court.
[02:25:14.119 --> 02:25:19.260]  So understand, I've got nine films, I've got a book I've written, it's only $12, Descent into Tyranny about September 11th.
[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:32.182]  We've got to get this story out, we've got to tell this story, or the globalists are going to continue to carry out terror and blame it on their enemies and pose as our saviors, when in truth, they are the usurpers, they are the enemy combatants, they are the terrorists.
[02:25:32.782 --> 02:25:40.744]  So go to infowars.com, that's I-N-F-O-W-A-R-S.com, or prisonplanet.com to order.
[02:25:41.527 --> 02:25:41.987]  1-888-253-3139 Get the videos.
[02:25:42.007 --> 02:25:43.408]  Start the revolution.
[02:25:43.428 --> 02:25:45.289]  The revolution of information.
[02:25:45.309 --> 02:25:45.369]  1-888-253-3139
[02:25:59.474 --> 02:26:14.320]  3139, or just write to me with your check or money order or fellow reserve note, to Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, spelled L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:17.181]  Take action.
[02:26:17.761 --> 02:26:18.562]  Get the films.
[02:26:18.842 --> 02:26:19.602]  Make the copies.
[02:26:19.662 --> 02:26:20.763]  Get them on AXS TV.
[02:26:21.223 --> 02:26:22.643]  Save America from the terrorists.
[02:26:22.723 --> 02:26:23.624]  It is so important.
[02:26:24.944 --> 02:26:26.245]  Ron, you said that Oklahoma...
[02:26:26.966 --> 02:26:30.688]  The city council was considering getting rid and decrying the Patriot Act.
[02:26:30.708 --> 02:26:33.470]  Would you like to tell us what you heard on the radio, Ron?
[02:26:33.911 --> 02:26:35.391]  That was basically it.
[02:26:35.592 --> 02:26:46.198]  Just a short announcement on a local radio broadcast that this morning the Oklahoma City Council would consider a resolution against the USA Patriot Act.
[02:26:47.139 --> 02:26:56.045]  And I was overwhelmed because ever since the Reichstag bombing here in Oklahoma City, we have been inundated with pro-
[02:26:56.733 --> 02:26:59.113]  Government propaganda.
[02:27:00.134 --> 02:27:00.974]  On and on and on.
[02:27:01.054 --> 02:27:02.954]  Bombing, bombing, bombing.
[02:27:03.054 --> 02:27:05.095]  McVeigh, Nichols, on and it never stopped.
[02:27:06.055 --> 02:27:18.537]  And I could not imagine the Oklahoma City Council entertaining any resolution against any government, any law, any government activity.
[02:27:18.677 --> 02:27:19.897]  I was overwhelmed, Alex.
[02:27:20.617 --> 02:27:24.578]  Ron, would you like to tell the listeners who carried out the Oklahoma City bombing?
[02:27:27.243 --> 02:27:46.573]  Alex, of course, my first thought way back when was after the bombing, we were completely overwhelmed with propaganda that the government went after the right wing, the militias, on and on.
[02:27:46.653 --> 02:27:47.413]  It never stopped.
[02:27:48.034 --> 02:27:53.817]  So I related this to the Reichstag fire in Nazi Germany, I think it was February 24th of 1933, when Hitler's people...
[02:27:59.208 --> 02:28:13.894]  And it did turn out that there were multiple bombs that didn't go off, the building was blown out, not in.
[02:28:14.055 --> 02:28:17.796]  Absolute fact, seismographs, former head of Air Force weapons development.
[02:28:18.276 --> 02:28:21.558]  There were Iraqis on the ground, known to be in the employ of the U.S.
[02:28:21.598 --> 02:28:25.960]  government, brought here after the Gulf War, trained here in the 80s when Saddam was the ally.
[02:28:27.023 --> 02:28:34.628]  And the BATF admitted to police that were interviewed on local news, and it's in my film, No to Tyranny, saying that the BATF admitted they were warned not to go to work that day.
[02:28:35.188 --> 02:28:36.189]  The judge was out.
[02:28:37.450 --> 02:28:44.014]  Mrs. Graham, the head of HUD, saw the white men planting gray sticks of butter and wires on the support columns.
[02:28:44.695 --> 02:28:48.597]  The feds have seized the surveillance camera tapes and declared national security.
[02:28:48.957 --> 02:28:52.760]  We've talked to the police and FBI that saw those, showed the Iraqis.
[02:28:53.140 --> 02:28:54.481]  This was a government program.
[02:28:57.955 --> 02:28:58.975]  So that's the bottom line.
[02:28:59.556 --> 02:29:03.677]  How many people would you say in Oklahoma now know who was really behind Oklahoma City bombing?
[02:29:04.497 --> 02:29:19.662]  Alex, when I first started passing your tapes out about a year ago, there was a lot of skepticism, but I am noticing that more and more people that I talk to now are a lot more receptive and aware of what's going on.
[02:29:19.782 --> 02:29:22.802]  I'm well over 200 tapes that I've passed out.
[02:29:23.923 --> 02:29:27.204]  And somewhere along the line...
[02:29:30.025 --> 02:29:32.666]  The public attitude is changing.
[02:29:33.547 --> 02:29:40.309]  At one time, everyone said the government did a good job, that it was McVeigh and Nichols and nothing else and blah, blah, blah.
[02:29:40.849 --> 02:29:46.992]  But now the government has changed its story and said that Saddam was involved.
[02:29:47.652 --> 02:29:54.735]  They've done a 180 here, and people are beginning to question the government and wonder, hey, well, they said it was McVeigh and Nichols.
[02:29:55.706 --> 02:29:57.728]  And now they're saying, well, Saddam was involved.
[02:29:58.048 --> 02:30:00.530]  You know why that hurt them so bad?
[02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:01.972]  I was on the air for what?
[02:30:02.973 --> 02:30:12.181]  Three years before they announced that Saddam was involved, saying, why would Iraqis be involved who we know are in the employ of the government, FBI, CIA?
[02:30:12.761 --> 02:30:14.343]  Why would they cover that up at the time?
[02:30:14.683 --> 02:30:17.105]  They're waiting to release this at another point.
[02:30:17.165 --> 02:30:18.887]  And they did do that on national news.
[02:30:20.097 --> 02:30:36.164]  And so they wanted that case where they could blame it on whoever they wanted, and they wanted to have the nexus between militia and Muslim for what you're now seeing unfold, saying our Christians terrorists, the Eric Rudolph script, merging that in with the Muslims.
[02:30:36.224 --> 02:30:45.248]  So this is part of a propaganda ploy, and I think that we have neutralized and short-circuited a lot of their plan because of our analysis.
[02:30:45.308 --> 02:30:47.089]  How long have you been listening, Ron?
[02:30:47.529 --> 02:30:49.690]  Probably a year or so, maybe a little over a year.
[02:30:49.930 --> 02:30:54.733]  Did you hear me before the Gulf War, too, saying they would soon bring it out against Saddam?
[02:30:55.173 --> 02:30:56.254]  Before the Gulf War?
[02:30:57.294 --> 02:30:57.994]  No, no.
[02:30:58.735 --> 02:31:00.596]  Not the first Gulf War.
[02:31:00.916 --> 02:31:01.816]  Oh, you mean this one?
[02:31:02.056 --> 02:31:02.337]  Yes.
[02:31:02.697 --> 02:31:02.957]  Right.
[02:31:03.573 --> 02:31:04.634]  Well, yes you were.
[02:31:04.674 --> 02:31:07.836]  Alex and I heard William Crystal saw him one night on Nightline.
[02:31:33.838 --> 02:31:34.638]  Yeah, they're bragging.
[02:31:34.719 --> 02:31:38.080]  It's the Project for the American Century, founded in 96, key policy reports 98, 99, 2000.
[02:31:38.460 --> 02:31:43.583]  They said, in their own published reports, on their own website, Saddam isn't a threat, we want the oil, and as a military base.
[02:31:58.204 --> 02:31:59.565]  We're going to set up a police state.
[02:31:59.605 --> 02:32:04.887]  We need a Pearl Harbor or larger catastrophic event to galvanize the people behind this.
[02:32:05.348 --> 02:32:09.890]  So did the founder of the Trilateral Commission, Brzezinski, said that too in a 97 book.
[02:32:10.530 --> 02:32:17.193]  And then they get on Nightline, and I've got it on tape, and brag, yeah, we planned all this, but it's for your own good.
[02:32:17.514 --> 02:32:18.914]  That's their arrogance, sir.
[02:32:19.435 --> 02:32:22.936]  Alex, everything we're seeing now, these guys are just reading from a script.
[02:32:23.577 --> 02:32:24.297]  It's all scripted.
[02:32:25.545 --> 02:32:33.767]  We heard the drumbeat, Saddam, Saddam, Saddam, and they keep beating it up, raising the crescendo, and finally it's war against Saddam.
[02:32:34.227 --> 02:32:40.888]  And now we're hearing they're going after Iran, and they're starting the drumbeat, and it's picking up faster and faster.
[02:32:41.928 --> 02:32:50.650]  And I think anyone that pays attention to what's going on, and even in the media now,
[02:32:51.610 --> 02:33:04.853]  Where our information flow is so restricted and so distorted, and our media is so controlled, anyone, even in that atmosphere, can see what they're doing by simply paying attention.
[02:33:05.053 --> 02:33:09.254]  Absolutely, and understanding what thugs have done throughout history and the nature of power.
[02:33:09.294 --> 02:33:10.175]  Thanks for the call, Ron.
[02:33:10.255 --> 02:33:10.475]  Alex?
[02:33:10.915 --> 02:33:11.175]  Yes?
[02:33:11.515 --> 02:33:15.456]  Is InfoWars a free website, or do you have to subscribe?
[02:33:17.016 --> 02:33:19.137]  InfoWars.com has about 50 to 80...
[02:33:20.718 --> 02:33:21.299]  We're good to go.
[02:33:40.871 --> 02:33:53.455]  Of RovanNet, same service, their 1-800 number, they're great people, they're proxy servers and protection for anonymity when you're surfing, for less than AOL.
[02:33:54.676 --> 02:33:57.317]  That is a service, and that helps us pay.
[02:33:57.377 --> 02:34:06.500]  That service, people that subscribe, help us pay for the bandwidth for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and all that, which continue to grow.
[02:34:07.879 --> 02:34:11.503]  We're now in the top 5% of all websites.
[02:34:12.063 --> 02:34:22.275]  We were in the top 10% just a year ago, and the present planet's already in the top 5%, 4 point something, just after eight months in operation.
[02:34:23.175 --> 02:34:31.260]  So the way you support the websites, and what we do there is you sign up at infowars.net or internet service.
[02:34:32.060 --> 02:34:33.301]  Dial up ISDN.
[02:34:33.321 --> 02:34:34.922]  They're about to have DSL if you want that.
[02:34:35.022 --> 02:34:36.003]  Nationwide service.
[02:34:36.603 --> 02:34:43.927]  And you have a proxy server, proxy browser that blocks cookies in your identity.
[02:34:43.967 --> 02:34:46.669]  It's like a cloaking device on a Klingon vessel.
[02:34:47.612 --> 02:34:50.814]  And so that's why people should go sign up at InfoWars.net.
[02:34:51.054 --> 02:34:53.235]  But no, all the information on the websites is free.
[02:34:54.216 --> 02:34:54.956]  Why do you ask?
[02:34:58.518 --> 02:35:03.721]  Okay, well, Ron asked a question and hung up, but I hope that answers your question, Ron.
[02:35:05.522 --> 02:35:08.603]  But no, the websites are free.
[02:35:10.084 --> 02:35:13.426]  And so that's what goes on there.
[02:35:14.577 --> 02:35:18.543]  Okay, let me go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:35:19.304 --> 02:35:21.366]  Let's go through these quickly because I've got some news I need to hit.
[02:35:21.787 --> 02:35:23.569]  Charles in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:35:23.609 --> 02:35:23.970]  Go ahead.
[02:35:24.691 --> 02:35:25.312]  Alex Jones.
[02:35:25.945 --> 02:35:26.205]  Yes.
[02:35:26.505 --> 02:35:29.287]  Hey, I caught a little bit of that John Ashcroft.
[02:35:29.327 --> 02:35:30.408]  This is a scary guy.
[02:35:30.828 --> 02:35:32.529]  First he says there is no Patriot Act.
[02:35:32.969 --> 02:35:35.190]  Then anybody that says it, age terrorist.
[02:35:35.250 --> 02:35:37.551]  And now, oh yeah, there is a second Patriot Act.
[02:35:37.892 --> 02:35:40.433]  Pass it or 10 million of you could die next.
[02:35:40.493 --> 02:35:41.253]  He actually said that.
[02:35:41.434 --> 02:35:43.335]  Yeah, he is strictly hardcore.
[02:35:43.375 --> 02:35:49.598]  I was wondering, did you notice, or was it me, the contempt he had for these Congress critters?
[02:35:49.618 --> 02:35:50.679]  He was shouting at them.
[02:35:50.699 --> 02:35:51.739]  He was turning purple.
[02:35:52.119 --> 02:35:53.020]  He was arrogant.
[02:35:54.745 --> 02:35:56.647]  This was in your face.
[02:35:57.107 --> 02:35:58.569]  We're setting up a dictatorship.
[02:35:59.069 --> 02:35:59.550]  Shut up!
[02:35:59.590 --> 02:36:00.551]  It's for your own good.
[02:36:02.312 --> 02:36:05.675]  This Jerome Maidler, I was wondering where he was from.
[02:36:05.695 --> 02:36:12.502]  This guy, he's a fat weasel from New York that's implementing all these gun-grabbing legislation.
[02:36:13.368 --> 02:36:15.029]  Well, he basically made a fool of him.
[02:36:15.089 --> 02:36:16.569]  I don't know if you saw that or not.
[02:36:16.969 --> 02:36:19.110]  He read some article out of the Washington Post.
[02:36:19.210 --> 02:36:23.111]  I mean, he said, I don't even read the Washington Post, or on occasion I will.
[02:36:23.551 --> 02:36:25.132]  But basically he made a fool of the guy.
[02:36:25.452 --> 02:36:34.255]  But when they panned back to him, this neighbor I'm speaking of, he was shaking his head in agreement with what he was saying.
[02:36:34.275 --> 02:36:38.856]  And you just wonder, you know, you've said many times how much of this is just
[02:36:39.411 --> 02:36:40.032]  It's scripted.
[02:36:40.092 --> 02:36:41.353]  It's the dialectic.
[02:36:41.453 --> 02:36:42.714]  Well, no.
[02:36:43.335 --> 02:36:56.166]  Sir, look, if you get a history book about LBJ in Congress or Kennedy or Roosevelt or any of these people, a hundred years ago, they wrote about it.
[02:36:56.927 --> 02:37:00.751]  They would go meet, committee chairman would meet, and they'd say, all right, you're going to act like you're against this.
[02:37:00.771 --> 02:37:03.153]  At the last minute, you're going to come out for it.
[02:37:03.746 --> 02:37:08.570]  And then that'll sway those that were against it with you because, oh, the guy that was against it now sees the light.
[02:37:11.781 --> 02:37:14.062]  That's like Colin Powell saying, I'm against the war.
[02:37:14.102 --> 02:37:14.703]  It's not right.
[02:37:14.743 --> 02:37:15.483]  We don't have evidence.
[02:37:15.503 --> 02:37:17.805]  And then right when the troops are masked, I was wrong.
[02:37:17.865 --> 02:37:18.245]  It's true.
[02:37:18.265 --> 02:37:19.286]  There's incredible evidence.
[02:37:19.586 --> 02:37:20.847]  Let me pitch the idea.
[02:37:20.867 --> 02:37:22.928]  And the news goes, it's incredible.
[02:37:23.408 --> 02:37:24.709]  The dove is now forward.
[02:37:24.769 --> 02:37:25.609]  It must be good.
[02:37:25.930 --> 02:37:27.371]  Powell has such credibility.
[02:37:27.751 --> 02:37:30.152]  I said before that he was going to be the one that came out with it.
[02:37:30.512 --> 02:37:31.373]  Totally staged.
[02:37:31.673 --> 02:37:34.075]  And Ron mentioned distortion of the news.
[02:37:34.095 --> 02:37:35.415]  Let me give you an example of distortion.
[02:37:35.996 --> 02:37:37.637]  You're listening to radio, watching TV.
[02:37:39.036 --> 02:37:42.257]  You hear there's a new bill to get corrupt money out of politics.
[02:37:42.337 --> 02:37:44.397]  Campaign finance reform.
[02:37:45.397 --> 02:37:46.538]  Well, what did the bill really do?
[02:37:46.978 --> 02:37:51.939]  Double the amount of the soft, secret corporate contributions that is the corrupting influence.
[02:37:53.059 --> 02:38:00.001]  Doubles that amount of money, but restricts a show like this one having Larry Pratt on 60 days before an election.
[02:38:00.021 --> 02:38:01.561]  It destroys the First Amendment.
[02:38:02.859 --> 02:38:09.524]  Brings in all these new penalties and control, stops the money that little people can give, private people, but doubles what corporations can give.
[02:38:10.625 --> 02:38:12.086]  It's not a good reform.
[02:38:12.466 --> 02:38:13.307]  It's a bad reform.
[02:38:13.647 --> 02:38:15.849]  Two years ago, they, quote, changed the medical rule.
[02:38:15.889 --> 02:38:17.990]  CNN said, it's for privacy.
[02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:19.651]  You'll have more privacy.
[02:38:19.691 --> 02:38:20.892]  It's a privacy bill.
[02:38:21.313 --> 02:38:22.153]  Bush signs it.
[02:38:22.654 --> 02:38:24.075]  Gives you no privacy.
[02:38:24.435 --> 02:38:29.799]  Federalizes your local health clinic where they have to have a database hooked in with the feds, which is then shared.
[02:38:29.859 --> 02:38:29.979]  So...
[02:38:31.368 --> 02:38:32.948]  Just their lying is incredible.
[02:38:33.709 --> 02:38:39.790]  So you have to become as cynical and develop that mentality that these people have.
[02:38:39.850 --> 02:38:44.011]  But what they'll do in an article is they'll say, this bill gives you more freedom.
[02:38:44.911 --> 02:38:49.572]  And then in the bottom of the article it'll say, it lets them arrest you for no reason and execute you.
[02:38:50.253 --> 02:38:51.753]  Now, they're calling that freedom.
[02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:54.392]  See, a lot of times it's right there in the article.
[02:38:54.432 --> 02:38:56.834]  They'll say, people love this new bill.
[02:38:57.134 --> 02:38:58.195]  It'll keep us all safe.
[02:38:58.575 --> 02:39:00.016]  The Pentagon's going to watch us.
[02:39:00.737 --> 02:39:01.738]  It's all in your face now.
[02:39:02.118 --> 02:39:05.241]  Well, you made a mention of... Well, here's another one.
[02:39:05.441 --> 02:39:09.184]  Bush is moving to protect pension funds and making them go to cash balance accounts.
[02:39:09.524 --> 02:39:15.349]  You will no longer own your pension fund and have no right to it, but this will help the corporations fund the pension funds.
[02:39:16.182 --> 02:39:16.862]  It's good.
[02:39:16.882 --> 02:39:22.905]  You just send your mind spinning backwards, and eventually people won't even pay any attention to what they're saying.
[02:39:22.965 --> 02:39:24.466]  Yeah, there isn't a Patriot Act.
[02:39:24.886 --> 02:39:26.207]  If you say there is, you're a terrorist.
[02:39:26.507 --> 02:39:27.828]  Now, there is a Patriot Act.
[02:39:29.449 --> 02:39:30.509]  It's all about immigrants.
[02:39:30.589 --> 02:39:31.189]  No, it's not.
[02:39:31.530 --> 02:39:34.351]  That's a liberal conservative issue they throw out there as a red herring.
[02:39:35.567 --> 02:39:40.671]  It's amazing how I got to pick up this little book by Dennis Cuddy about the NEA.
[02:39:40.731 --> 02:39:43.694]  I had no idea that these people had been around as long as they have.
[02:39:44.034 --> 02:39:44.915]  And they're talking about 1928.
[02:39:45.755 --> 02:39:50.079]  You mentioned David Rockefeller talking about how great China was.
[02:39:50.459 --> 02:39:51.240]  Mao Zedong.
[02:39:51.460 --> 02:39:55.763]  Yeah, how wonderful it was, and he was the greatest man in the last hundred years and all this.
[02:39:55.883 --> 02:40:00.067]  Well, this is John Dewey, who they made a... Dewey Decimal System, yeah.
[02:40:01.219 --> 02:40:16.713]  Yeah, I mean, this guy had come back from... Now, this is almost 50 years before Rockefeller had made this statement, and he's talking about the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and how wonderful, this is in 1928, their system was.
[02:40:16.813 --> 02:40:25.320]  And we should take this progressive education ideas and their practices and put this into art.
[02:40:25.861 --> 02:40:27.923]  The bankers wrote the Communist Manifesto
[02:40:29.170 --> 02:40:34.714]  To con the serfs back into serfdom, back into tyranny, back into feudalism.
[02:40:35.595 --> 02:40:41.800]  And if you read the ten planks of the Communist Manifesto, eight of them are fully realized and implemented in America.
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:42.380]  Thanks, Charles.
[02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:42.761]  Thank you.
[02:40:43.481 --> 02:40:44.882]  Real quick, Mark in Oklahoma.
[02:40:45.363 --> 02:40:45.803]  Go ahead.
[02:40:45.983 --> 02:40:46.264]  Hello?
[02:40:47.004 --> 02:40:47.925]  Mary, go ahead, Mary.
[02:40:49.446 --> 02:40:55.871]  I want to say quickly that I'm able to clearly see that the government has most probably...
[02:40:59.096 --> 02:41:08.681]  Don't dump this monkey pox on us, because right away, before they, you know, even hardly have a name of a victim, they know which animals to go after.
[02:41:08.741 --> 02:41:12.263]  And sure enough, it's the same animals in those pet shops.
[02:41:13.904 --> 02:41:14.304]  Stay there.
[02:41:14.344 --> 02:41:21.068]  I'll let you have about a minute on the other side, then I've got to hit the Internet taxation and stuff on the war and some other key tidbits.
[02:41:21.728 --> 02:41:23.169]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:41:23.209 --> 02:41:23.769]  Stay there, Mary.
[02:41:23.789 --> 02:41:24.530]  I'll let you finish up.
[02:41:25.393 --> 02:41:26.214]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:41:26.234 --> 02:41:31.216]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:41:31.256 --> 02:41:32.037]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:32.077 --> 02:41:33.478]  Please stay with me.
[02:41:33.858 --> 02:41:35.539]  We do real talk radio on this show.
[02:41:36.900 --> 02:41:41.242]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:41.422 --> 02:41:45.845]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:46.005 --> 02:41:50.367]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:50.407 --> 02:41:51.748]  The New World Order.
[02:41:53.535 --> 02:41:57.756]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:57.816 --> 02:42:04.737]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:04.877 --> 02:42:06.938]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:07.238 --> 02:42:17.719]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:20.620]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:20.700]  888-253-3139.
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:21.680]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:42:36.227 --> 02:42:39.710]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:42:39.970 --> 02:42:43.492]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:42:43.572 --> 02:42:47.515]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:42:47.735 --> 02:42:53.900]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:43:02.226]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:43:02.626 --> 02:43:07.970]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:43:08.130 --> 02:43:11.893]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:43:12.273 --> 02:43:14.115]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:43:14.175 --> 02:43:16.357]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:43:16.597 --> 02:43:21.540]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[02:43:35.052 --> 02:43:40.333]  Most people realize that everyday life can be pretty unpredictable at times, but that doesn't mean your business has to be.
[02:43:40.533 --> 02:43:47.254]  A quick call to GTI Technologies is all it takes to put your business far ahead of the competition with the help of a predictive dialer.
[02:43:47.434 --> 02:43:52.335]  With a predictive dialer, your sales increase automatically as you eliminate no answers and answering machines.

[02:43:54.856 --> 02:43:58.776]  Take the guesswork out of accidental calls to people on state or federal do-not-call lists.
[02:43:59.016 --> 02:44:01.697]  These kind of mistakes can cost a company thousands of dollars.
[02:44:01.977 --> 02:44:02.738]  We're good to go.

[02:44:37.599 --> 02:44:42.761]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:43.421 --> 02:44:45.642]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:44:46.947 --> 02:44:53.269]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day and back from 9 to midnight Central right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:53.349 --> 02:44:54.149]  Thank you for joining me.
[02:44:54.449 --> 02:44:56.350]  Real quick, Mary in Oklahoma.
[02:44:56.890 --> 02:45:04.752]  Well, I just want to say real quickly that, I mean, there's a lot of animals, a lot of exotic animals, you know, right here in Oklahoma.
[02:45:04.812 --> 02:45:06.033]  The zoos have monkeys.
[02:45:07.573 --> 02:45:13.815]  A lot of people, believe it or not, have privately owned monkeys, which they're greatly attached to and attend to.
[02:45:14.708 --> 02:45:20.092]  And my mouth is still open that they can identify the prairie dog as the carrier.
[02:45:21.153 --> 02:45:21.573]  Thank you.
[02:45:22.494 --> 02:45:22.794]  All right.
[02:45:22.814 --> 02:45:23.595]  Appreciate the call.
[02:45:23.635 --> 02:45:26.417]  Well, we know they gave West Nile to Saddam, and then it showed up here.
[02:45:26.457 --> 02:45:27.038]  Our government did.
[02:45:27.058 --> 02:45:29.900]  We know that they've released many other biologicals.
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:32.062]  We know that Lyme's disease comes from Plum Island.
[02:45:32.102 --> 02:45:32.882]  That's conclusive.
[02:45:32.902 --> 02:45:34.203]  The bioweapons lab.
[02:45:34.223 --> 02:45:36.365]  We know the British government released foot and mouth in England.
[02:45:36.965 --> 02:45:39.327]  We know this, and we know it's very important.
[02:45:39.347 --> 02:45:41.549]  That's why you should go to infowars.com and see our...
[02:45:42.376 --> 02:45:43.137]  We're good to go.
[02:46:06.641 --> 02:46:09.603]  And they're all out of control, racing ahead with this entire system.
[02:46:09.783 --> 02:46:10.223]  Here's one.
[02:46:10.243 --> 02:46:10.584]  The U.S.
[02:46:10.624 --> 02:46:12.365]  plans a ring of bases for quick strikes.
[02:46:12.425 --> 02:46:13.466]  You mean the bankers do.
[02:46:14.366 --> 02:46:23.732]  Smaller, more mobile battle groups will replace large, slower divisions at forward operating bases around the world for quick strikes to bring down people's governments.
[02:46:23.813 --> 02:46:28.115]  So the new thing is where the stormtroopers go in, take over the capital, blast everybody.
[02:46:28.155 --> 02:46:28.896]  That's a new system.
[02:46:30.319 --> 02:46:30.940]  Also, U.S.
[02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:42.129]  says, you mean the globalists say, again, it's not us, it's the New World Order, says Iran harbors al-Qaeda associate, so they're going to need to go ahead and invade them and start the invasion preparation.
[02:46:42.209 --> 02:46:44.190]  Same thing with North Korea after they arm them.
[02:46:44.711 --> 02:46:46.972]  EU stirs up Internet sales tax debate.
[02:46:47.713 --> 02:46:56.040]  On July 1st, the 15-nation EU will begin collecting VAT, or value-added tax, on sales of digital goods and other electronic transactions from the U.S.
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:46:58.582]  and other non-EU companies.
[02:46:59.904 --> 02:47:00.825]  So that's interesting.
[02:47:01.125 --> 02:47:09.270]  That means that American companies selling downloadable music, movies, games, and software to customers in the EU might have to collect taxes that could boost the total cost of their products in Europe.
[02:47:10.611 --> 02:47:18.396]  And the UN says they own the Internet, they own your domain names, that they're going to make us have this tax if it's going to be sold over there.
[02:47:19.737 --> 02:47:21.177]  So it's a very serious issue.
[02:47:21.217 --> 02:47:25.660]  Even if you're not into computers or into buying stuff online, this is the takeover, folks.
[02:47:25.740 --> 02:47:28.162]  It's going to be a global body that does it, not the U.S.,
[02:47:29.617 --> 02:47:40.321]  Supreme Court allows Agent Orange to suit Vietnam veterans with recently diagnosed ailments consumed despite the 85 out-of-court settlement between companies and veterans.
[02:47:41.142 --> 02:47:42.662]  They knew what that dioxin was doing.
[02:47:42.702 --> 02:47:43.563]  They knew it was bad.
[02:47:44.083 --> 02:47:46.404]  They could care less about our troops because they're globalists.
[02:47:47.151 --> 02:47:49.193]  Also, cash crisis forces U.S.
[02:47:49.613 --> 02:47:51.014]  to print Saddam banknotes.
[02:47:51.034 --> 02:47:51.835]  They're back to printing.
[02:47:52.355 --> 02:47:58.160]  Our government runs the central bank presses, has put Abbas back in control, and they're going to print money with Saddam on it.
[02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:00.442]  So that's from Reuters as well.
[02:48:01.790 --> 02:48:07.314]  And widespread looting leaves Iraqi oil industry in ruins, and the Iraqis are very mad.
[02:48:07.374 --> 02:48:09.616]  They protest over oil jobs for Asians.
[02:48:10.276 --> 02:48:15.099]  Yeah, this is Halliburton and other, Brown and Root and Kellogg, other U.S.
[02:48:15.139 --> 02:48:15.580]  companies.
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:17.001]  They aren't hiring Americans either.
[02:48:17.401 --> 02:48:18.782]  Chinese, folks!
[02:48:19.818 --> 02:48:20.678]  We're good to go.
[02:48:35.567 --> 02:48:35.967]  Whatever.
[02:48:36.408 --> 02:48:39.890]  Blair and Campbell will shun Commons inquiry into weapons of mass destruction.
[02:48:40.310 --> 02:48:43.052]  They say there won't be any inquiry into how they put out false reports.
[02:48:43.733 --> 02:48:50.017]  Another article out of Tech TV, New World Order PC review about a game where you're a UN soldier and kill militia members.
[02:48:51.999 --> 02:48:57.983]  All the propaganda, ladies and gentlemen, hitting you in the movies, sitcoms, video games, comic books.
[02:48:59.339 --> 02:49:01.040]  Nightly News, it's everywhere.
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:02.520]  Learn how to recognize it.
[02:49:02.580 --> 02:49:04.341]  Teach your family how to recognize it.
[02:49:04.761 --> 02:49:06.262]  Teach others how to recognize it.
[02:49:06.602 --> 02:49:07.923]  Stand up and fight the globalists.
[02:49:08.603 --> 02:49:23.069]  Thanks to all our affiliates, AM, FM, Shortwave Internet, Satellite, the folks running the show, to my wife and webmaster, Violet Jones, my webmaster from Prison Planet, Paul Joseph Watson, to our great listeners, to everybody, the sponsors.
[02:49:23.509 --> 02:49:24.449]  God bless you all.
[02:49:24.849 --> 02:49:26.190]  I'll see you back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:27.401]  We're good to go.
