[00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:06.705]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.271]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:16.972]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.692 --> 00:00:18.813]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:20.274]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:21.955]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:26.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.778 --> 00:00:29.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:30.032 --> 00:00:30.892]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:33.553]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:33.894]  Welcome.
[00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:37.115]  It's already Tuesday, the 11th day of November 2003.
[00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:38.115]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:44.077]  Your host will be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:44.137 --> 00:00:47.238]  We have Tito Howard.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.847]  Who was on board the USS Liberty back in 1968 when the ship came under attack.
[00:01:08.127 --> 00:01:12.591]  And we're going to be talking about the film he made several years ago, The Loss of Liberty.
[00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:17.635]  In the past, we've had former Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Moore and others on.
[00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:20.977]  I'm going to be getting Captain Boston on the show later this week.
[00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:26.222]  We're going to do several hours on this because it's now come out in the mainstream news.
[00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:38.653]  People at the highest levels of the Pentagon face-to-face when LBJ and McNamara covered up the fact that the Israelis intentionally attacked the USS Liberty.
[00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:45.815]  And I've talked over the years to dozens of the survivors on air, and they agree that the U.S.
[00:01:46.035 --> 00:01:52.437]  government was in control of that ship, ordering the Israelis to attack it, to sink it, to blame it on Egypt.
[00:01:53.007 --> 00:02:01.751]  This has now come out, mainstream news, so we'll be going over that in the second hour of the show.
[00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:04.212]  So stay with us and tell your friends and family to tune in.
[00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:16.837]  I got a call this morning from a friend, and he was saying, Alex, I need specifics on this partial birth abortion ban not being really a ban of the procedures.
[00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:21.250]  And so I looked around for a few minutes, found a couple of the news articles.
[00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.432]  We're going to post them, but they're not already posted, on Infowars.com.
[00:02:25.532 --> 00:02:27.573]  And I guess it's really open for debate.
[00:02:28.193 --> 00:02:35.996]  And so I'm not the medical expert on partial birth abortions, so I'm going to have the national right-to-life groups on the show.
[00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:43.179]  I'm going to have the people on the groups on that are saying this isn't a real ban of partial birth abortions.
[00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:45.837]  I think we're good to go.
[00:02:58.152 --> 00:03:01.113]  I know that Bush is a member of Skull and Bones, the Bohemian Grove.
[00:03:01.173 --> 00:03:05.855]  I know he clapped to summon the demon at the Shinto Shrine in Tokyo.
[00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:09.877]  I know that he has Muslim prayer meetings.
[00:03:10.497 --> 00:03:15.039]  I know that the guy is deeply into the occult.
[00:03:16.287 --> 00:03:20.150]  And still people deny that and say, well, it's debatable.
[00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.632]  Maybe he's just having fun at Skull and Bones.
[00:03:24.672 --> 00:03:27.154]  Maybe he's just having fun at the Bohemian Grove.
[00:03:27.534 --> 00:03:32.838]  There's a lot of denial out there about the type of individual that George W. Bush is.
[00:03:33.018 --> 00:03:34.839]  But this is debatable.
[00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.980]  Whether it's a ban on partial birth abortion.
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.780]  So I'm going to, as I said, I'd set up guests on the USS Liberty.
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.160]  Give me a few days.
[00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:45.881]  I'll set up the National Right to Life Organization Foundation.
[00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:48.002]  I'll get on the show.
[00:03:48.022 --> 00:03:49.642]  In fact, I've already emailed him this morning.
[00:03:49.702 --> 00:03:58.304]  David Brownlow of News with Views, who I've seen write great articles in the past, who says that the partial birth abortion ban is a fraud.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.225]  And I'll get on a couple of the other conservative writers that have said the same thing, and then we'll let you listen and decide.
[00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:10.049]  Because, I mean, again, it depends on what the word is, is means.
[00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.611]  You know, it's more of this double speak.
[00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:18.637]  And Bush had to do something because the Republicans have the legislature, the executive, the judicial.
[00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:25.243]  I mean, we see this Republican-controlled Supreme Court saying that sodomy is A-OK.
[00:04:26.212 --> 00:04:28.173]  Maybe you're in denial about that, too.
[00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:29.593]  I don't know.
[00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:32.394]  Those points aren't debatable, though.
[00:04:32.614 --> 00:04:45.917]  This is debatable about the partial birth abortion ban, because it's all done in lawyer speak, and it's up to the discretion, really, of the doctors, and now they've got the courts piling in on the debate.
[00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.138]  So we'll talk about that, too.
[00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:50.059]  There's just so much crazy news.
[00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.300]  Remember that BBC reporter who said that rural communities serve the same rights as Muslims and gays?
[00:04:56.385 --> 00:04:57.406]  He said homosexuals.
[00:04:57.606 --> 00:04:58.647]  Well, he got arrested.
[00:04:59.107 --> 00:05:07.514]  Now the big bishop over there is going to be arrested because he said that homosexuality isn't good.
[00:05:11.397 --> 00:05:11.757]  We're good to go.
[00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:36.049]  We're good to go.
[00:06:05.603 --> 00:06:14.072]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:14.232 --> 00:06:18.676]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:18.817 --> 00:06:23.181]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:24.583]  A New World Order.
[00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:26.557]  We're good to go.
[00:06:53.274 --> 00:06:53.594]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:53.634 --> 00:06:54.635]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:12.753]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name brand medications.
[00:07:12.893 --> 00:07:15.895]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:34.126]  We're good to go.
[00:08:03.806 --> 00:08:17.354]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:17.974 --> 00:08:21.016]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.777 --> 00:08:25.379]  It is Tuesday, the 11th day of November 2003.
[00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:28.581]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:30.522]  Thanks for joining us today.
[00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:47.081]  We have Tito Howard, who's been at the head of the Liberty Committee, the group that has Admiral Moore and several other admirals, dozens of captains, many of the victims who were on board the USS Liberty in the late 1960s.
[00:08:47.101 --> 00:08:47.621]  And it happened June 8, 1967.
[00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:48.301]  I said June 8, 1968.
[00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:52.064]  I'm bad on dates, but here's the article right in front of me.
[00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.192]  And we covered this yesterday about how LBJ ordered them
[00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:22.072]  We're good to go.
[00:09:36.248 --> 00:09:38.110]  Bush is cutting benefits.
[00:09:38.451 --> 00:09:39.912]  They announced that yesterday.
[00:09:40.353 --> 00:09:48.781]  Two veterans of the Gulf War, they're, quote, taking their disability checks to, quote, pay for the new war in Iraq.
[00:09:49.382 --> 00:09:58.872]  A mother of seven is being ordered back to Iraq, despite the fact that she may lose custody of her children.
[00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:05.253]  It looks like the depleted uranium levels are even higher than we first were hearing about in the mainstream media.
[00:10:05.653 --> 00:10:08.173]  They're higher than 1,900 times.
[00:10:08.614 --> 00:10:12.055]  So we'll talk about supporting the veterans here on the show as well.
[00:10:12.815 --> 00:10:22.918]  And I can think of no better way to honor the veterans than to tell the truth of what happened to some of the folks, including the Congressional Medal of Honor winner, the captain of the USS Liberty back in 1967.
[00:10:23.058 --> 00:10:27.599]  And this is now on the record, no debating it.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:34.443]  I've been criticized for having the crew of the USS Liberty on, for having Admiral Thomas Moore on.
[00:10:34.863 --> 00:10:42.067]  I've been criticized for having Tito Howard on, why the History Channel says the attack on the Liberty was an accident.
[00:10:42.367 --> 00:10:43.588]  How dare I say this?
[00:10:44.168 --> 00:10:48.369]  You know, I can't help it if I have the actual victims, the actual heroes on the show.
[00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:54.150]  I can't help it if the Jewish newspapers admit it and the Israeli pilots admitted it and didn't want to attack the ship.
[00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.591]  I can't help it if LBJ had the fighter aircraft turned back.
[00:10:57.971 --> 00:11:00.452]  I can't help it if it fits in with the Northwoods plan.
[00:11:00.832 --> 00:11:01.992]  I can't help the facts.
[00:11:03.072 --> 00:11:03.452]  I can't.
[00:11:03.952 --> 00:11:10.834]  You know, I do my best here, Monday through Friday, from 11 to 2 and back from 9 to midnight, to tell the truth.
[00:11:10.874 --> 00:11:11.714]  You know, I got up here...
[00:11:13.078 --> 00:11:13.598]  We're good to go.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.403]  People who've been blowing the whistle on the fact that the Jessica Lynch story wasn't true.
[00:11:37.423 --> 00:11:51.571]  Oh, by the way, the woman that filed the rape charge, the 38-year-old woman that filed the rape charge against George W. Bush, the Houston Chronicle did report that she died of a gunshot wound to the head a couple weeks ago.
[00:11:51.651 --> 00:11:52.932]  We just learned of this.
[00:11:53.032 --> 00:12:01.117]  I have the Houston Chronicle article here in the stack today, and that's being posted on InfoWars.com as well.
[00:12:01.617 --> 00:12:02.878]  I stayed away from that case.
[00:12:03.118 --> 00:12:04.359]  I've mentioned it two or three times.
[00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:05.559]  I said, I don't know if it's true.
[00:12:06.119 --> 00:12:08.020]  Any wacko could claim this.
[00:12:09.841 --> 00:12:11.062]  This type of stuff happens.
[00:12:11.142 --> 00:12:11.762]  We don't know.
[00:12:11.842 --> 00:12:12.983]  She could be telling the truth.
[00:12:14.503 --> 00:12:16.764]  But now she's dead.
[00:12:17.024 --> 00:12:17.525]  Wow.
[00:12:17.925 --> 00:12:22.547]  Kind of like the guy that wrote Fortunate Son about Bush and cocaine use.
[00:12:23.855 --> 00:12:27.176]  Ending up dead in an Arkansas bathtub, Arkansas hotel bathtub.
[00:12:27.676 --> 00:12:36.339]  We also have a few weeks to go, and the transcript of this from CNN is on Infowars.com, being posted right alongside the Houston Chronicle obituary.
[00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:52.604]  Barbara Bush, the matriarch of the family, has gone public saying, if you criticize my family, my children, my husband, you're dead.
[00:12:54.514 --> 00:12:56.456]  So what do you think about that?
[00:12:56.496 --> 00:12:59.178]  Just a lot of death swirling around.
[00:13:00.038 --> 00:13:07.464]  Now, I remember about two days after the Patriot Act passed, even before Ron Paul had made statements on the subject, I went and got the bill.
[00:13:07.624 --> 00:13:09.166]  I read almost the entire bill.
[00:13:09.206 --> 00:13:10.887]  I spent hours and hours and hours.
[00:13:11.974 --> 00:13:20.847]  Over two nights reading it, I wrote an analysis that's still posted on the site of Patriot Act 1 where I said it has secret warrantless searches.
[00:13:22.068 --> 00:13:24.592]  It will be used against the general public.
[00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.736]  It will violate your rights at every level.
[00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.992]  And I got a lot of criticism for that one, too.
[00:13:31.092 --> 00:13:33.994]  And they said, no, it's only to stop the Muslims.
[00:13:34.054 --> 00:13:35.275]  It's only to stop the terrorists.
[00:13:35.295 --> 00:13:36.596]  It's only to stop the foreigners.
[00:13:37.056 --> 00:13:40.860]  And I said, Section 802 says it's for any action that endangers human life.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.382]  It's a violation of any federal or state law.
[00:13:44.502 --> 00:13:54.250]  And now the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the Associated Press, the Washington Times, ABC News, they've all been reporting it's being used for marijuana, family violence, sex.
[00:13:56.121 --> 00:14:00.623]  Check writing, hot check writing, sending emails, spams.
[00:14:01.344 --> 00:14:03.025]  It's being used across the board.
[00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:07.707]  And the Las Vegas Review-Journal, with one of the worst cases I've seen, is using it.
[00:14:08.708 --> 00:14:20.994]  The Las Vegas Review-Journal is reporting on the feds using it to go after a topless bar owner they think paid off a county commissioner for favorable zoning changes.
[00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:30.656]  I'm no fan of the topless bars or that type of lifestyle, but my point here is that it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:14:30.816 --> 00:14:32.357]  And here it is for you.
[00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:49.732]  Now, I throw all that out there because I've gotten a few emails and a few phone calls by good folks asking, Alex, where's the articles, where's the proof that this isn't a ban on partial birth abortion that took place a couple weeks ago and that Bush signed into law?
[00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:52.251]  Where's the proof?
[00:14:52.851 --> 00:15:09.635]  And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to have David Brownlow of News with Views on, and I've read his articles over the last few years and found them to be very accurate, very insightful, and I saw a couple other articles by some pro-life groups saying, well, this isn't strong enough, but it's a start.
[00:15:10.616 --> 00:15:14.396]  Mr. Brownlow says the partial birth abortion ban is a fraud, is a scam.
[00:15:14.977 --> 00:15:20.738]  So I'm going to get Mr. Brownlow up, and I'm going to get some of the big pro-life groups that we've supported and had on the show
[00:15:22.436 --> 00:15:31.823]  I'm not totally sure that there was a ban on partial birth abortion or that there wasn't a ban on partial birth abortion because questions have been raised and I don't have definitive answers.
[00:15:46.873 --> 00:15:47.773]  I've read the bill.
[00:15:48.454 --> 00:15:49.634]  I need to print the bill again.
[00:15:49.714 --> 00:15:50.735]  I need to read it again.
[00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:58.258]  It's going to take hours, and it's going to take a while to set up these guests, but we will have a two-hour show.
[00:15:58.338 --> 00:15:59.718]  We'll do two-thirds of a show.
[00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:03.720]  We'll do two hours of a broadcast and longer if need be.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.441]  We'll do several shows if need be.
[00:16:06.001 --> 00:16:10.803]  On this subject, we'll take your calls from folks in the pro-life movement like myself.
[00:16:10.823 --> 00:16:12.344]  I've been in it for about eight years.
[00:16:13.224 --> 00:16:14.465]  Not as long as a lot of people.
[00:16:15.006 --> 00:16:19.209]  And we will come to a consensus here on this broadcast.
[00:16:20.671 --> 00:16:27.196]  Let me right now, though, read the David Brownlow article of September 25, 2003.
[00:16:28.077 --> 00:16:31.300]  Okay, so this is from a couple weeks ago.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.004]  After 30 years, and here's the headline, the partial birth abortion scams.
[00:16:37.111 --> 00:16:40.414]  After 30 years of empty promises by pro-life leaders in the U.S.
[00:16:40.434 --> 00:16:51.802]  Congress, it came as no surprise that they would pass a completely meaningless ban on a barbaric and indefensible method of child killing known as the partial birth abortion.
[00:16:52.523 --> 00:17:04.172]  Senate Bill S-3 and House Bill H-R-760 provide ironclad proof that it is impossible to spend decades voting for the lesser of two evils and end up with anything but evil.
[00:17:04.913 --> 00:17:13.616]  It does look like the Senate and the House will work out the language in their respective bills and send it on for the President Bush to sign it.
[00:17:13.696 --> 00:17:18.318]  Unfortunately, there appears to be no argument on the key wording of the actual ban.
[00:17:18.998 --> 00:17:21.459]  Now, again, I have read the bill from this point on.
[00:17:21.719 --> 00:17:27.221]  I don't know if they changed it right before Bush signed it, right before it finally passed.
[00:17:27.281 --> 00:17:28.042]  We'll find out.
[00:17:28.682 --> 00:17:33.764]  Both of the bills allow a doctor to kill a child during the very process of birth until...
[00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:50.122]  In the case of the head first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or in the case of a breech presentation, the child should be killed before any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside of the body of the mother.
[00:17:50.443 --> 00:17:54.266]  Actual text of S3 and HR 760 in quotes.
[00:17:54.986 --> 00:17:55.887]  This is not a ban.
[00:17:56.247 --> 00:17:57.568]  Those are targeting coordinates.
[00:17:57.949 --> 00:18:01.612]  Plain and simple, the abortionists may be cunning, but they are certainly not stupid.
[00:18:01.652 --> 00:18:03.173]  This will not even slow them down.
[00:18:04.048 --> 00:18:04.188]  I think.
[00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:04.448]  I think.
[00:18:04.468 --> 00:18:04.628]  I think.
[00:18:22.345 --> 00:18:28.628]  Using the language of this ban and a somewhat stunning setback for the cause of the unborn, while the pro-life members of the U.S.
[00:18:28.668 --> 00:18:33.870]  House managed to simply pass a meaningless piece of pro-life legislation, the pro-life members of the U.S.
[00:18:33.911 --> 00:18:36.252]  Senate have taken betrayal to a whole new level.
[00:18:36.952 --> 00:18:46.997]  Most in the pro-life community chose to ignore the poison that was slipped into Section 4 of the March 2003 Senate version of the ban as part of S-348.
[00:18:47.297 --> 00:18:51.899]  Republicans and 16 Democrats voted to approve the sense of the Senate
[00:18:52.495 --> 00:19:08.079]  Concerning Roe v. Wade, which says, findings, the Senate finds that abortion has been a legal and constitutionally protected medical procedure throughout the United States since the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S.
[00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:08.079]  113, 1973.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:20.323]  And two, it goes, the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade established constitutionally based limits on the power of states to restrict the right of a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy.
[00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:29.491]  B, sense of the Senate, in the sense of the Senate that the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S.
[00:19:29.511 --> 00:19:33.152]  113, 1973, was appropriate and secure as an important constitutional right.
[00:19:33.732 --> 00:19:37.954]  And two, of part B, such decisions should not be overturned.
[00:19:39.455 --> 00:19:44.137]  And it says every Republican senator who ever told us they were pro-life is simply amazing.
[00:19:45.978 --> 00:19:46.558]  Now, look.
[00:19:47.432 --> 00:20:01.880]  The point here is, while we're all celebrating how Christian and good Bush is, the point is, you still have, and you can't debate this, late term, third trimester, nine months, abortions going on.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.243]  That needs to be banned, not just pulling the baby's head out and killing it.
[00:20:07.283 --> 00:20:07.923]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:21.062]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:20:21.243 --> 00:20:28.785]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.

[00:22:10.307 --> 00:22:12.528]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:22:12.949 --> 00:22:17.311]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:23.395]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:27.677]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:22:27.957 --> 00:22:33.620]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.342]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:22:38.443 --> 00:22:41.966]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[00:22:42.066 --> 00:22:44.748]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:22:45.108 --> 00:22:47.390]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.413]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:22:51.893 --> 00:22:58.098]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:22:58.539 --> 00:22:59.499]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:22:59.519 --> 00:23:00.300]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:00.560]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:09.735 --> 00:23:12.438]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[00:23:33.439 --> 00:23:33.819]  We're good to go.
[00:24:05.239 --> 00:24:05.679]  Don't wait.
[00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:06.560]  Do it today.
[00:24:12.821 --> 00:24:18.842]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:19.442 --> 00:24:22.483]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:25.163 --> 00:24:27.704]  I've got a giant stack of really important news here.
[00:24:27.784 --> 00:24:28.884]  A bunch of phone calls.
[00:24:30.885 --> 00:24:39.533]  So I want to hurry, but I want to spend a little bit more time here from this article that I was babbling through by David Brownlow from News with Views.
[00:24:39.573 --> 00:24:42.856]  And again, it's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:24:43.056 --> 00:24:45.158]  And I agree with these points he makes.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.002]  This bill needs to die for a number of reasons, and he goes on.
[00:24:50.042 --> 00:24:51.043]  It is a complete fraud.
[00:24:51.063 --> 00:24:52.083]  It won't save any lives.
[00:24:52.103 --> 00:24:58.007]  The signatures of the pro-life Republicans who voted to reaffirm Roe v. Wade will permanently stay in the congressional record.
[00:24:58.027 --> 00:25:04.211]  He's talking about the sense of the Senate statement that a bunch of Republicans signed on to reaffirming Roe v. Wade.
[00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:07.833]  Four, it will give political cover to the phony pro-lifers in Congress.
[00:25:08.113 --> 00:25:08.874]  Hey, I'm pro-life.
[00:25:08.914 --> 00:25:09.714]  I voted for the ban.
[00:25:10.114 --> 00:25:13.216]  Five, it will give the Congress an excuse not to pass a real pro-life bill.
[00:25:13.536 --> 00:25:15.718]  But does Article III reversal of Roe v. Wade...
[00:25:16.298 --> 00:25:19.480]  ...or the inclusion of the unborn in the Fifth Amendment definition of a person.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:25.983]  It will give comfort to pro-lifers that something is being done to save children, when in fact nothing is being done.
[00:25:26.023 --> 00:25:29.085]  Millions will continue to die when the bill is passed.
[00:25:30.085 --> 00:25:31.606]  And again, the bill was passed.
[00:25:32.346 --> 00:25:40.350]  But I'm going to have this guy on, and I'm going to have some of the good pro-life groups on, and we'll... I mean, it obviously does something.
[00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:44.032]  It means they can't suck the baby's brains out and crush its skull...
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:26:08.407]  It limits much of the partial birth abortion procedure, but again, as this writer says, in the last few minutes of a nine-month process, to be able to kill a baby that can be adopted right there on the spot in the last trimester is totally insane and totally wicked.
[00:26:09.625 --> 00:26:16.429]  And I'm hearing a lot of people celebrate how great Bush is and what a wonderful job he did and how we should just thank God for him.
[00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:27.436]  Folks, I thank God for all the pro-lifers that have gone to jail, all the people that have protested and demonstrated and written letters and contributed money and supported radio stations that speak out against this abomination.
[00:26:29.497 --> 00:26:33.179]  I mean, look at George Bush's wife out there promoting Roe v. Wade.
[00:26:34.358 --> 00:26:34.798]  I hope.
[00:26:34.818 --> 00:26:34.938]  I pray.
[00:26:53.752 --> 00:26:55.853]  That they've really banned partial birth abortion.
[00:26:55.893 --> 00:27:06.980]  But from the other articles I've read on this subject, from what doctors have been saying is, is the abortionists are just going to kill the baby up in the womb and take it out of the woman's body?
[00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:18.626]  And so, yes, one of the more grisly forms of abortion may have been restricted if the socialists are defeated with what these wicked federal courts are doing.
[00:27:19.827 --> 00:27:20.407]  But to...
[00:27:21.897 --> 00:27:23.839]  To say, oh, we've had this great victory.
[00:27:23.879 --> 00:27:25.140]  Look how good George Bush is.
[00:27:25.521 --> 00:27:27.703]  The Republicans have the Supreme Court.
[00:27:28.123 --> 00:27:29.865]  The Republicans have the governorships.
[00:27:30.165 --> 00:27:33.048]  The Republicans have the legislatures.
[00:27:33.088 --> 00:27:35.170]  They have the House and the Senate.
[00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:36.812]  They have the executive.
[00:27:36.912 --> 00:27:38.854]  We need to repeal Roe v. Wade.
[00:27:39.334 --> 00:27:40.636]  And look, we're not a democracy.
[00:27:40.676 --> 00:27:41.497]  We're a republic.
[00:27:42.554 --> 00:27:44.255]  So again, you're welcome to call in on this subject.
[00:28:12.071 --> 00:28:19.915]  I'm going to have to spend some time tonight going back over the bill, and again, I'm going to set up some guests on this subject, and we're going to have a debate about it.
[00:28:20.495 --> 00:28:34.181]  I haven't made my mind up, because reading this legalese is complex, but I lean towards what David Brownlow of News Reviews and what others have said, that it's a scam.
[00:28:34.841 --> 00:28:38.543]  But again, if I'm wrong, praise God, that would be a wonderful thing.
[00:28:39.187 --> 00:28:47.012]  But I don't disagree with his points about how this is a psychological salve that, oh, they can't kill the baby outside the womb now.
[00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:47.672]  Isn't that great?
[00:28:47.712 --> 00:28:49.834]  They can just kill the baby inside the womb.
[00:28:50.494 --> 00:28:52.816]  Oh, George Bush is such a good Christian conservative.
[00:28:54.076 --> 00:28:56.658]  Now, let me tell you about some of the news that's coming up, then we'll go to these calls.
[00:28:56.758 --> 00:29:00.320]  Police to question bishop over gay cure comment.
[00:29:01.241 --> 00:29:04.103]  The bishop, Reverend Peter...
[00:29:05.825 --> 00:29:16.212]  Forster, Bishop of Chester, will be questioned by the constabulary after the force received a complaint about his comments in a local newspaper last week.
[00:29:17.153 --> 00:29:25.399]  He said that we should reach out to homosexuals, try to wake them up, try to reform them, and they've already arrested BBC reporters and others for doing this.
[00:29:25.459 --> 00:29:32.784]  Now they want to take him into custody for questioning the side of he should be charged, and they're consulting with the Scotland Yard Diversity Unit.
[00:29:33.422 --> 00:29:35.464]  Now, folks, talk about mind control.
[00:29:35.564 --> 00:29:37.365]  Talk about thought crimes.
[00:29:37.446 --> 00:29:38.026]  This is it.
[00:29:38.707 --> 00:29:45.693]  So we'll get into that and a bunch of what they're doing to the troops on Veterans Day and your calls all on the other side.
[00:29:45.753 --> 00:29:51.998]  But for those that have read the bill, for those that have seen the debates, do you think this was a ban on partial birth abortion?
[00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:55.261]  Is it a ban on late-term abortion?
[00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:57.322]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[00:29:57.402 --> 00:29:57.803]  Stay with us.
[00:30:00.575 --> 00:30:01.477]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.978 --> 00:30:03.582]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.524 --> 00:30:07.210]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.201]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:30:14.442 --> 00:30:15.862]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:30:16.342 --> 00:30:17.783]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.

[00:30:28.367 --> 00:30:37.070]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease and clove oil.
[00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:38.631]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:42.911]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:30:43.171 --> 00:30:49.794]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[00:30:50.134 --> 00:30:54.175]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:32.036]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:32:32.376 --> 00:32:36.478]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:32:36.598 --> 00:32:37.138]  We're good to go.

[00:33:01.231 --> 00:33:02.072]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:33:20.957 --> 00:33:22.898]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:22.938 --> 00:33:23.699]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:23.779 --> 00:33:24.800]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.383]  We're here live and then, of course, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:33:28.403 --> 00:33:31.065]  We're about to go to Brock and Wes and Dean and many others.
[00:33:31.746 --> 00:33:33.928]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:38.348 --> 00:33:48.334]  You know, folks, I just have a bad feeling overall and I've learned to follow my discernment, not just the evidence in front of me, about this so-called partial birth abortion ban.
[00:33:48.354 --> 00:33:51.836]  We're going to get to the bottom of this and find out what it actually does.
[00:33:52.016 --> 00:34:07.306]  But from the reading of it, they can still kill the baby up in the birth canal and they just can't pull its head out and suck its brains out and kill it if any part of it has come out of the womb.
[00:34:08.104 --> 00:34:11.286]  Now, again, I just have news articles that quote the subsections.
[00:34:11.326 --> 00:34:19.252]  I don't have the bill in front of me today, but I am going to read it and go over it and, as I said, have some guests on about this subject.
[00:34:19.272 --> 00:34:29.920]  But overall, this worship of the Republican Party and this defense of George Bush and all these neocons saying, oh, look, he signed this.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.041]  He's good now.
[00:34:31.921 --> 00:34:33.222]  We knew it all along.
[00:34:33.302 --> 00:34:34.443]  He's a good Christian.
[00:34:35.384 --> 00:34:36.985]  I know that's a fraud.
[00:34:37.945 --> 00:34:40.526]  I know he says he's going to sign that assault weapons ban.
[00:34:40.706 --> 00:34:43.307]  I know he's for blanket amnesty and open borders.
[00:34:43.607 --> 00:34:45.768]  I know he signed on to UNESCO.
[00:34:45.968 --> 00:34:47.988]  I know he's expanded the size of the federal government.
[00:34:48.368 --> 00:34:52.009]  I know he signed the Patriot Act and wants to sign Patriot Act II.
[00:34:52.049 --> 00:34:55.090]  And I know they're using that against the American people.
[00:34:55.410 --> 00:35:03.153]  And I know they've got the Pentagon lying in our media and sending out fake letters that weren't signed by the soldiers about how much they love the war.
[00:35:04.127 --> 00:35:04.767]  We're good to go.
[00:35:04.787 --> 00:35:05.188]  We're good to go.
[00:35:27.381 --> 00:35:42.485]  And CNS News rightfully points out that, wait a minute, the Patriot Act is part of a 10-year plan that Al Gore publicly called for, why Bill Clinton tried to pass many of the subsections that are in Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[00:35:43.285 --> 00:35:49.767]  And Al Gore, when he was a senator, was there supporting John Ashcroft on similar legislation.
[00:35:51.027 --> 00:35:55.608]  So just to see what happens is conservatives, good people, see Al Gore come out against something,
[00:35:56.235 --> 00:35:56.955]  We're good to go.
[00:35:56.975 --> 00:35:57.696]  We're good to go.
[00:36:13.486 --> 00:36:19.207]  And I listened to about 10 minutes, and I heard an ad for 24 tonight about biological attack.
[00:36:19.247 --> 00:36:21.568]  You know, the government has to take all your rights away.
[00:36:21.588 --> 00:36:24.869]  Beaver Sutherland, we're going to get hit by bioweapons.
[00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:28.869]  Next ad, OnStar keeps you safe, unlocks your car.
[00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.490]  Or if you're stranded, they save you with satellite tracking.
[00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.051]  Next ad, tonight on KI.
[00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:39.352]  The children on drugs want to rob you.
[00:36:39.412 --> 00:36:42.414]  What they're doing to fight juvenile crime.
[00:36:43.014 --> 00:36:43.994]  You're not safe.
[00:36:44.094 --> 00:36:45.655]  Only the police can save you.
[00:36:46.355 --> 00:36:50.997]  Then they come back and the show is talking about how good the Patriot Act is.
[00:36:52.618 --> 00:37:01.882]  It's wall-to-wall propaganda in the ads, in the TV shows, in the radio shows, in the newspapers everywhere.
[00:37:03.903 --> 00:37:04.683]  We're good to go.
[00:37:04.844 --> 00:37:05.084]  I think?
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:18.840]  We're good to go.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.160]  I think?
[00:37:43.183 --> 00:37:52.249]  He just said rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals, and Scotland Yard Diversity Unit had him arrested for the word homosexual.
[00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:53.690]  They said that's hateful.
[00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:58.573]  In fact, let me cover this Bishop article now, then I'll go to Brock, Wes, Dean, and others.
[00:37:59.094 --> 00:38:02.276]  Police to question Bishop over gay cure comment.
[00:38:02.296 --> 00:38:04.497]  Notice they say gay, can't say the word homosexual.
[00:38:04.958 --> 00:38:06.899]  This is out of the London Independent.
[00:38:08.175 --> 00:38:15.397]  A bishop who called on homosexuals to seek medical help to change their sexuality is to be interviewed by police.
[00:38:16.177 --> 00:38:28.000]  The retired Reverend Peter Foster, Bishop of Chester, will be questioned by Cheshire Constabulary after the force received a complaint about his comments in a local newspaper last week.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.221]  The Anglican bishop, who opposed both the
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.501]  A consecration of the openly gay, can't use the scientific word, homosexual.
[00:38:36.541 --> 00:38:37.401]  That's illegal in England.
[00:38:37.761 --> 00:38:54.365]  Gene Robinson, as Bishop of New Hampshire in the U.S., and the proposed appointment of canon, Jeffrey John, a cabinet, a celibate, homosexual, as Bishop of Reading City, would encourage gay people to try reorientation.
[00:38:55.006 --> 00:39:00.628]  He said some people who are primarily homosexual can reintegrate themselves.
[00:39:00.668 --> 00:39:04.449]  He added, I would not set myself up as a medical specialist on the subject.
[00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:07.330]  That is in the area of psychiatric health.
[00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:08.730]  He didn't even say it was wrong.
[00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:13.151]  And it is true that most homosexuals can shift back into being a heterosexual.
[00:39:13.952 --> 00:39:18.053]  Cheshire police confirmed yesterday that they plan to speak to the bishop.
[00:39:18.553 --> 00:39:21.674]  Assistant Chief Constable Green Gerhard said,
[00:39:22.563 --> 00:39:30.185]  Said, we are aware of the article put in the Cheshire Chronicle, or Chester Chronicle, excuse me, and have received a complaint.
[00:39:30.546 --> 00:39:39.668]  He continued, we will examine the issues raised in the complaint and will speak to the reporter and the Bishop of Chester before considering any further action.
[00:39:40.189 --> 00:39:47.511]  A spokesman said the force would send a copy of the article to the Crown Prosecution Service to see if an offense had been committed.
[00:39:48.098 --> 00:39:53.343]  Now, again, they arrested the BBC guy, quote, took him into custody for questioning.
[00:39:53.684 --> 00:39:54.905]  It looks like that's going to happen here.
[00:39:55.606 --> 00:40:09.056]  The bishop's comments to the Chester Chronicle came as the Church of England faces the prospect of a worldwide schism over the consecration of Bishop Robinson, which was bitterly opposed by the Anglicans in developing countries.
[00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:18.543]  His comments also follow a study at Columbia University in New York which suggests some homosexuals can become predominantly heterosexual through psychotherapy.
[00:40:19.023 --> 00:40:29.327]  The study was based on interviews with 200 men and women who said their sexual preferences had been changed by therapy often provided by religious organizations.
[00:40:31.108 --> 00:40:34.849]  So this guy doesn't even criticize it when the Bible says it's bad.
[00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:37.030]  Doesn't even criticize it.
[00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:41.312]  He says, well, maybe we can try to get folks to reintegrate into being heterosexuals.
[00:40:42.412 --> 00:40:46.214]  And for that, oh, you've got to come in for questioning at the police department.
[00:40:46.912 --> 00:40:48.593]  And the article goes on from there.
[00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:49.814]  I don't have time to read any more.
[00:40:49.874 --> 00:40:53.776]  It's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:40:55.097 --> 00:41:07.965]  And on InfoWars.com, we have posted the BBC article where they arrested the BBC reporter and where the Scotland Yard is quoted in there as saying he used the word homosexual.
[00:41:08.405 --> 00:41:09.586]  That is unacceptable.
[00:41:09.966 --> 00:41:10.807]  That is illegal.
[00:41:11.795 --> 00:41:14.597]  They have the head of the Scotland Yard Diversity Union.
[00:41:14.617 --> 00:41:19.220]  They're having hate crime raids on people that said something to someone in the street.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:32.728]  Meanwhile, there's record gun deaths, stabbing deaths, muggings, three and a half million cameras in the country, total police state, and the police are out focusing on what you said or what you did.
[00:41:33.969 --> 00:41:35.730]  And it's not just criticizing homosexuals.
[00:41:37.002 --> 00:41:44.685]  There have been ministers who've been fired or arrested or fined because they called the EU criminal or they criticized the European Union.
[00:41:44.985 --> 00:41:55.548]  And our Supreme Court, our dear Republican Court, along with their willing accomplices, the Democrats, have said on the record they're going to follow the rulings of the UN.
[00:41:55.949 --> 00:41:58.669]  The only member on the record against it is Scalia.
[00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:05.812]  That's the only person not making these statements about following the UN's orders.
[00:42:06.638 --> 00:42:08.039]  All right, let's go to Brock in Canada.
[00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:08.860]  Brock, you're on the air.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:09.280]  Go ahead.
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:10.641]  Hello, Alex.
[00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:11.101]  Welcome.
[00:42:11.642 --> 00:42:29.976]  I wanted to sort of take us down an example of, you know, in this country, we have a terrible justice system, you know, where people can, you know, mug and break and enter and get off scot-free.
[00:42:30.879 --> 00:42:37.363]  And I'm just wondering, with this terrible lack of justice, is there a Judas goat leading us somewhere?
[00:42:37.463 --> 00:42:46.669]  Like, is there going to be New World Order laws that are going to come in where, you know, people are going to have to pay for certain crimes?
[00:42:46.729 --> 00:42:53.073]  Or are they going to let the break-and-enter criminals off and just demonize others?
[00:42:53.633 --> 00:42:56.495]  California and England are models.
[00:42:56.875 --> 00:42:57.816]  So is Australia.
[00:42:57.916 --> 00:42:59.637]  I read the article last Friday.
[00:43:00.632 --> 00:43:01.153]  And it said it.
[00:43:01.993 --> 00:43:07.519]  Out of the Sydney Morning Herald, an activist sent an email to the government, to the U.S.
[00:43:07.579 --> 00:43:17.189]  consulate, protesting the Iraq war, and it said he didn't threaten anybody, it's just illegal to demonstrate or to organize or to protest now in Australia.
[00:43:17.549 --> 00:43:19.931]  Now, folks, that's what they said.
[00:43:20.212 --> 00:43:21.012]  That's the law.
[00:43:21.793 --> 00:43:23.435]  Four years after taking the guns.
[00:43:24.182 --> 00:43:25.343]  We're good to go.
[00:43:25.403 --> 00:43:25.944]  We're good to go.
[00:43:25.964 --> 00:43:26.624]  We're good to go.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.761]  We're good to go.
[00:44:07.526 --> 00:44:18.930]  According to CNS News, the Associated Press, passed a law that if preachers read out of the Old Testament comments that are against homosexuals, they can be held liable criminally or civilly.
[00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.250]  So this is happening everywhere.
[00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:25.692]  A guy was arrested in Utah for calling someone the N-word.
[00:44:25.852 --> 00:44:32.974]  I don't agree with calling someone the N-word, though the black man was assaulting his wife and called him racial terms towards white people.
[00:44:33.514 --> 00:44:48.901]  But in front of the crowd, when the reporter was being choked by the black coach, the woman's husband ran over and called him a name back, and he was arrested, and she lost her job, according to the Boise newspaper, according to World Net Daily.
[00:44:49.742 --> 00:45:00.907]  Well, it seems that, you know, I see here, you know, violent young punks, and they over and over just get revolving door through the
[00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:05.984]  The courts, and yet you can be arrested for calling someone a homosexual.
[00:45:06.304 --> 00:45:14.470]  Do you see the laws still remaining lax where old people can be beaten up and home invaded?
[00:45:15.111 --> 00:45:18.774]  Or do you think they'll come down on that, too, in a New World order?
[00:45:18.814 --> 00:45:24.517]  Well, you're in Canada, and we've read the articles where if you defend yourself in your home, they'll indict you, release the criminal.
[00:45:24.778 --> 00:45:29.120]  Look at all the cases with the farmers and even Harrison, the beetle.
[00:45:29.721 --> 00:45:34.324]  And there was some woman who was being stabbed, and the husband stabbed the intruder.
[00:45:34.584 --> 00:45:35.505]  He got indicted.
[00:45:36.786 --> 00:45:48.477]  The police questioned Harrison, who's dead now, but when they were attacking his wife and stabbing him, his wife finally hit him over the head with a lamp, and they questioned her considering an indictment.
[00:45:49.298 --> 00:45:53.361]  I mean, this is the insanity, but this is about training us to accept abuse.
[00:45:53.822 --> 00:45:56.805]  And so the statistics are out there.
[00:45:57.545 --> 00:46:05.070]  Non-violent offenders stay in longer than violent offenders because they make better Wackenhut workers, private prison workers.
[00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:08.392]  Violent offenders are released to continue to create the crisis.
[00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:11.574]  Yes, well, I believe that.
[00:46:11.694 --> 00:46:16.257]  My other question was going to be, is the New World Order behind schedule?
[00:46:16.437 --> 00:46:17.538]  I kind of think it is.
[00:46:18.768 --> 00:46:19.708]  It is way behind.
[00:46:19.748 --> 00:46:23.169]  We've had a lot of victories, and we need to celebrate those victories.
[00:46:23.229 --> 00:46:25.790]  But we haven't won the war against the Patriot Act.
[00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:28.330]  We haven't won the war against abortion.
[00:46:29.111 --> 00:46:34.812]  And a lot of these are just surface victories, but at least they're having to respond to us.
[00:46:35.132 --> 00:46:35.832]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:36.432 --> 00:46:37.052]  That's the key.
[00:46:37.412 --> 00:46:38.893]  Wes in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[00:46:38.933 --> 00:46:39.433]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:46:40.742 --> 00:46:41.323]  How are you today?
[00:46:41.343 --> 00:46:42.204]  Pretty good.
[00:46:43.085 --> 00:46:51.296]  Now that I can extract my size 14 foot from my mouth, I'd like to say mea culpa for that mistake I made yesterday.
[00:46:51.336 --> 00:46:52.718]  You were really right on the button.
[00:46:52.818 --> 00:46:54.701]  I researched the heck out of that.
[00:46:54.841 --> 00:46:55.682]  What did you research?
[00:46:55.722 --> 00:46:56.403]  I forget the call.
[00:46:56.944 --> 00:46:57.425]  Deliberty.
[00:46:58.559 --> 00:47:08.426]  I was questioning why Israel would want to try to drag us into a war against Egypt when they seem to be doing so well on their own.
[00:47:08.546 --> 00:47:13.149]  Israel, and again, I get attacked by the ADL, I get attacked by the Nazis.
[00:47:13.229 --> 00:47:16.151]  I mean, there are a bunch of websites, you know, saying I'm a Mossad agent.
[00:47:16.171 --> 00:47:17.412]  It's totally ridiculous.
[00:47:17.552 --> 00:47:20.074]  And yeah, I'm an Easter Bunny, too, and a Chinese jet pilot.
[00:47:20.574 --> 00:47:23.976]  But the point here is, Israel didn't control that ship.
[00:47:24.116 --> 00:47:25.877]  Israel didn't turn back the fighter jets.
[00:47:26.358 --> 00:47:29.379]  Israel wasn't shipping the weapons to Israel.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.721]  Israel was following orders, and that doesn't defend them.
[00:47:33.202 --> 00:47:36.423]  Israel was being used as the proxy to attack our ship.
[00:47:37.904 --> 00:47:41.606]  Yeah, I mean, that was perfectly clear from the research I did yesterday.
[00:47:42.147 --> 00:47:45.549]  Well, I mean, this stuff's in the associated press now.
[00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:46.649]  It's not a secret anymore.
[00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:48.410]  I just wanted to say that...
[00:47:50.896 --> 00:48:10.312]  You know, when we talk about partial birth abortion or abortion even in the first trimester, when you stop and think that a country whose very first words in its Declaration of Independence include life, liberty, and so forth,
[00:48:11.312 --> 00:48:14.434]  Without life, you can forget about liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:48:14.494 --> 00:48:20.977]  Well, I mean, it's like the media saying that Terri Schiavo was a vegetable when she wasn't.
[00:48:21.297 --> 00:48:22.558]  When she wasn't, absolutely.
[00:48:22.618 --> 00:48:23.959]  So, I mean, it's the same thing.
[00:48:24.179 --> 00:48:31.903]  But all I'm saying is people I respect are saying this isn't a real ban, that it just restricts the way they can do a partial birth abortion.
[00:48:32.603 --> 00:48:33.103]  I don't know.
[00:48:33.263 --> 00:48:37.105]  I'm going to find out the answers, and I hope it's a real ban.
[00:48:37.486 --> 00:48:40.167]  You know what, Alex, no matter where the heck it takes...
[00:48:41.144 --> 00:48:41.724]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:48:41.764 --> 00:48:45.206]  When we stoop to the level of turning a chamber... It's a compromise.
[00:48:45.226 --> 00:48:46.766]  The Republicans control everything.
[00:48:46.786 --> 00:48:48.527]  Where is the ban on Roe v. Wade?
[00:48:48.667 --> 00:48:51.768]  I want it now, and I don't want to hear that it's politically unpopular.
[00:48:52.168 --> 00:48:57.890]  The death crowd's going to vote for the Democrats regardless of what we do, and the majority of Americans are now against abortion.
[00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.351]  We've been winning this fight.
[00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:01.432]  We're right down to the goal line.
[00:49:01.692 --> 00:49:04.553]  Let's go ahead and run it up the middle and win this thing.
[00:49:04.953 --> 00:49:05.533]  Absolutely.
[00:49:05.713 --> 00:49:07.714]  I mean, I stand behind you 100%.
[00:49:07.934 --> 00:49:08.674]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:49:08.714 --> 00:49:14.137]  This whole thing stinks because we're all thanking George Bush for saying you can't kill the baby out of the womb.
[00:49:14.397 --> 00:49:17.938]  Let's get a ban at least on third trimester.
[00:49:19.258 --> 00:49:25.941]  Now, if Bush did that, I have to tell you, that right there would be wonderful.
[00:49:27.154 --> 00:49:27.955]  Well, I mean, you were there.
[00:49:44.611 --> 00:49:47.196]  People, I didn't get video of his face.
[00:49:47.216 --> 00:49:48.638]  Well, excuse me, so what?
[00:49:48.658 --> 00:49:51.864]  You know, I trust you.
[00:49:51.904 --> 00:49:52.305]  Wait a minute.
[00:49:52.465 --> 00:49:56.893]  A week later when I got back, they announced on CNN that he picked Dick Cheney at the Grove.
[00:49:58.271 --> 00:49:58.872]  Oh, I see.
[00:49:59.392 --> 00:50:00.614]  It's ridiculous.
[00:50:00.634 --> 00:50:02.316]  They admit he goes to the Grove.
[00:50:02.336 --> 00:50:03.958]  They admit he's skull and bones.
[00:50:03.978 --> 00:50:05.660]  But still, there's this denial.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.942]  This is a stronghold of Christianity.
[00:50:08.022 --> 00:50:08.623]  I'm sorry.
[00:50:08.803 --> 00:50:10.805]  You can walk the walk.
[00:50:10.926 --> 00:50:12.087]  I mean, you can talk the talk.
[00:50:12.648 --> 00:50:15.571]  But unless you walk the walk, you don't have me convinced.
[00:50:17.129 --> 00:50:19.930]  My point is, even if you're not a Christian, you should be against abortion.
[00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:20.391]  Well, sure.
[00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:21.411]  Absolutely.
[00:50:21.511 --> 00:50:23.592]  It's murder, no matter which way you look at it.
[00:50:24.392 --> 00:50:26.614]  And see, now it's euthanasia.
[00:50:26.694 --> 00:50:27.874]  Now it's eugenics.
[00:50:28.775 --> 00:50:31.556]  See, it's all the other stuff that comes with it.
[00:50:32.156 --> 00:50:33.056]  Yeah, all these names.
[00:50:33.197 --> 00:50:34.377]  But you know what?
[00:50:34.397 --> 00:50:40.040]  Alex, the day that women start bearing chickens is when I'll accept that abortion's okay.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.982]  I mean, what are they trying to convince us that that is growing in that woman's body?
[00:50:45.996 --> 00:50:47.097]  Well, it's amazing.
[00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:49.418]  It's a human being, for Pete's sake.
[00:50:49.478 --> 00:50:52.460]  It's a small human being, but it's a human being.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.743]  And if you leave it the heck alone, eventually, in nine months, you're going to have a human being.
[00:50:56.763 --> 00:51:01.546]  Well, my point is, with partial birth abortion or late-term abortion, you can adopt those babies.
[00:51:02.066 --> 00:51:03.267]  It needs to be illegal.
[00:51:03.407 --> 00:51:04.468]  That's where we start.
[00:51:06.068 --> 00:51:08.370]  Again, we've got to keep moving forward.
[00:51:10.296 --> 00:51:12.097]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[00:51:12.297 --> 00:51:15.158]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[00:51:15.399 --> 00:51:17.239]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:18.920]  Rates are low right now.
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.221]  Call and compare.
[00:51:20.481 --> 00:51:30.966]  For example, a man age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1 million of coverage is only $75 a month level for the next 10 years.
[00:51:31.246 --> 00:51:32.907]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:51:32.927 --> 00:51:33.067]  800-430-6692.
[00:51:33.087 --> 00:51:33.167]  800-430-6692.
[00:51:33.207 --> 00:51:35.970]  If you're a smoker, we have great rates for you, too.
[00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.971]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:51:36.991 --> 00:51:37.051]  800-430-6692.
[00:51:37.071 --> 00:51:37.111]  800-430-6692.
[00:51:37.131 --> 00:51:40.074]  We specialize in term life insurance policies of a half million dollars or more.
[00:51:55.289 --> 00:52:00.756]  Remember, $1 million in term life insurance coverage for as little as $3 a day.
[00:52:00.856 --> 00:52:02.017]  Call right now.
[00:52:02.318 --> 00:52:03.959]  Operators are standing by.
[00:52:10.607 --> 00:52:11.067]  We're good to go.
[00:52:39.398 --> 00:52:39.878]  We're good to go.
[00:52:39.898 --> 00:52:40.619]  We're good to go.
[00:53:10.751 --> 00:53:18.155]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:53:18.415 --> 00:53:23.158]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:53:23.378 --> 00:53:29.021]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:53:29.261 --> 00:53:29.981]  We're good to go.
[00:53:45.871 --> 00:53:48.412]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:53:48.613 --> 00:53:55.375]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:53:55.575 --> 00:54:00.817]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:01.257]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:54:15.206 --> 00:54:17.107]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:17.587 --> 00:54:20.409]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:22.790]  Hi, Dean and others.
[00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:24.431]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:54:24.471 --> 00:54:30.635]  Then we've got Tito Howard coming on the show from the USS Liberty, one of the survivors.
[00:54:31.615 --> 00:54:40.460]  Later in the week, we've got Captain Ward Boston, the Senior Legal Counsel, who was face-to-face with LBJ when he told him
[00:54:41.474 --> 00:54:45.517]  You cover this up, and they've now talked about this in press conferences.
[00:54:46.097 --> 00:54:47.638]  On the record, got a bunch of people coming up.
[00:54:47.658 --> 00:54:48.939]  We're going to do several shows on this.
[00:54:48.999 --> 00:54:53.042]  And again, several shows on what really happened with the partial birth abortion ban.
[00:54:53.382 --> 00:55:01.827]  Does it really change anything of substance, or does it just give different targeting coordinates to the murderers, to the abortionists there at the abortuaries?
[00:55:02.748 --> 00:55:07.431]  Before I go any further, though, I've made my tenth film, Matrix of Evil.
[00:55:08.274 --> 00:55:11.277]  It's got Congressman Ron Paul, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.
[00:55:11.698 --> 00:55:22.368]  It's got Frank Morales, police state expert, Colonel Craig Roberts, excerpts of three speeches I've given, my entire speech before the Austin City Council, before they threw out the Patriot Act.
[00:55:23.289 --> 00:55:25.312]  It's got a lot of different news clips and documents.
[00:55:25.832 --> 00:55:28.735]  It's a very powerful video full of solutions.
[00:55:29.196 --> 00:55:30.457]  Matrix of Evil!
[00:55:31.824 --> 00:55:47.459]  Over two hours long, $25.95, but when you order three or more of any of the ten videos, Road to Tyranny, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, Police State's Retotal Enslavement, it drops down to $20 per video, and your purchase also makes this show possible.
[00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:50.550]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:51.931]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:52.311 --> 00:55:58.874]  Order the videos, the books, the audio cassettes, the CDs via our secure online shopping cart or call toll-free at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:05.197 --> 00:56:05.417]  I think.
[00:56:05.497 --> 00:56:05.757]  I think.
[00:56:24.306 --> 00:56:37.073]  253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:56:37.613 --> 00:56:39.074]  It's up to you to wake people up.
[00:56:39.494 --> 00:56:40.394]  Dean in Canada.
[00:56:40.414 --> 00:56:41.695]  Another call from Canada.
[00:56:41.735 --> 00:56:42.235]  Go ahead.
[00:56:42.255 --> 00:56:43.396]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:43.576 --> 00:56:44.737]  I spoke to you the other day.
[00:56:45.057 --> 00:56:46.318]  Thank you very much for your answer.
[00:56:47.158 --> 00:56:52.161]  Bohemian Grove, who are the thousand people that are watching and how did you get in?
[00:56:52.948 --> 00:56:54.779]  And after that, I have another question for you.
[00:56:56.084 --> 00:57:24.194]  Well, in my video, when you called a couple weeks ago, I asked you, have you seen the video, and you said you hadn't seen Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, but the first hour of the two-hour and five-minute film is flying there with the British media covering my infiltration, how we snuck in, maps of the grove, video of us sneaking in, but I basically climbed on my hands and knees across fallen trees through a swamp-like moat they dug out
[00:57:24.954 --> 00:57:26.115]  We're good to go.
[00:57:42.904 --> 00:57:45.065]  Wow, that's amazing that there are actually, you know, there's at least 1,000 people out there.
[00:57:45.085 --> 00:57:46.246]  Yeah, the number total of memberships is about 1,400.
[00:57:46.386 --> 00:57:46.806]  Outstanding.
[00:58:12.785 --> 00:58:13.746]  Switch topics now.
[00:58:14.426 --> 00:58:29.278]  Everyone that's educating us about, you know, Illuminati, New World Order, etc., etc., is always doing it in contrast with Christianity, which puts Christianity in a favorable... Well, what does that say about Christianity, that we're the people fighting the New World Order?
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:35.223]  I'm not sure what it says, but that's one thing I wanted to talk to you about.
[00:58:36.124 --> 00:58:36.945]  Well, you know what?
[00:58:37.685 --> 00:58:38.446]  I've got Tito...
[00:58:39.384 --> 00:58:42.106]  Howard coming on the show, but we'll get him on in about five minutes.
[00:58:42.146 --> 00:58:48.232]  Stay there, and I'll try to answer your question when we start the next hour, but I'm not exactly sure what your question is specifically.
[00:58:49.252 --> 00:58:50.754]  But we'll talk about it on the other side.
[00:58:51.214 --> 00:58:57.059]  I'm talking about real Christians, certainly the establishment Christians are telling us George Bush is basically the second coming.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:01.541]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:01.561 --> 00:59:02.561]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:59:28.866 --> 00:59:29.947]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:30.607 --> 00:59:31.427]  You want answers?
[00:59:32.208 --> 00:59:33.088]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:33.108 --> 00:59:37.590]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:37.951 --> 00:59:42.053]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:44.534 --> 00:59:46.955]  Again, I feel I just need to state this again.
[00:59:46.975 --> 00:59:51.137]  The Las Vegas Review-Journal has got members of the U.S.
[00:59:51.157 --> 00:59:52.638]  Senate, members of the legislature,
[00:59:53.661 --> 01:00:00.948]  Talking about how they're now using the Patriot Act against county commissioners against topless bars in zoning corruption cases.
[01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:04.972]  So, again, see, we told you so.
[01:00:05.293 --> 01:00:07.855]  I told you that over two years ago when I read the Patriot Act.
[01:00:08.456 --> 01:00:11.899]  We're all terrorists, from misdemeanors to felonies.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:17.405]  If you're suspected of committing any crime, you have no rights under the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[01:00:18.226 --> 01:00:21.969]  I'm going to get into more of the Patriot Act in the third hour and a ton of other news I haven't even gotten to.
[01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:25.831]  Walmart commits billions to RFID and has been caught in a lie.
[01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:32.696]  The tracker chips, they have now been caught putting it in your clothing and other items to track you outside the store.
[01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:33.957]  This is all mainstream news.
[01:00:34.617 --> 01:00:35.138]  We're good to go.
[01:00:56.164 --> 01:01:03.767]  Here to cover up that Israel intentionally attacked this ship to try to sink it and strafe the lifeboats, try to blame it on Egypt.
[01:01:04.067 --> 01:01:06.948]  But again, the Pentagon was in control of that with LBJ.
[01:01:07.268 --> 01:01:12.050]  This has now come to light, as we told you years ago it was, from all the evidence.
[01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:13.370]  That's coming up.
[01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:21.433]  But Dean in Canada, he called a couple weeks ago, or was it last week, and said, ask questions about the Bohemian Grove video and...
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.043]  Again, there's just so many mainstream news articles out there.
[01:01:26.324 --> 01:01:27.886]  They admit the Grove's real.
[01:01:27.926 --> 01:01:29.287]  The world leaders go there.
[01:01:29.487 --> 01:01:36.996]  Helmut Schmidt, in his own book, Men and Powers, German Chancellor, before Helmut Kohl, said that, I'm a member of the Trilateral Commission, CFR.
[01:01:37.056 --> 01:01:40.901]  I love the druid rituals we do at the Bohemian Grove with the presidents.
[01:01:42.104 --> 01:01:42.884]  I snuck in there.
[01:01:42.964 --> 01:01:44.105]  I got video of the ritual.
[01:01:44.285 --> 01:01:49.446]  The Grove admits on national television on the Trio Network that I indeed did get this video.
[01:01:49.886 --> 01:01:51.087]  It's a real story.
[01:01:51.867 --> 01:01:57.228]  And Dean keeps bringing that up and asking questions, which I think is important.
[01:01:57.308 --> 01:01:57.549]  Why?
[01:01:57.649 --> 01:01:59.529]  Are you doubting what I'm saying, Dean?
[01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:01.970]  Oh...
[01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:08.105]  I became a little bit suspicious because the video wasn't clear, to tell you the truth.
[01:02:08.146 --> 01:02:10.147]  Now, you said you haven't seen the video.
[01:02:10.188 --> 01:02:11.889]  You haven't seen my video.
[01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.990]  Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
[01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:16.394]  What you posted on the net wasn't clear, I should say.
[01:02:18.243 --> 01:02:21.846]  Well, there's a lot of other clear video streams on the web.
[01:02:21.946 --> 01:02:23.347]  Some of our streams aren't the clearest.
[01:02:23.367 --> 01:02:24.427]  You might search around.
[01:02:24.447 --> 01:02:28.950]  I mean, we're not masters of the whole what they call video cleaning for the web.
[01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:31.552]  But, again, you just keep saying that wasn't clear.
[01:02:32.073 --> 01:02:34.614]  Have you researched mainstream news articles?
[01:02:35.215 --> 01:02:36.336]  Type in Bohemian Grove.
[01:02:36.396 --> 01:02:38.097]  Hundreds will pop up in your search engine.
[01:02:38.437 --> 01:02:39.738]  Have you researched the Grove?
[01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.192]  I was just going to ask you that next.
[01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:43.352]  Where can I go to do that?
[01:02:43.412 --> 01:02:48.096]  But if that's all that it takes... You go to a major search engine, you type in Bohemian Grove, George Bush.
[01:02:49.437 --> 01:02:50.098]  That's amazing.
[01:02:50.118 --> 01:02:53.660]  You go to a major search engine, you type in Skull and Bones, George Bush.
[01:02:54.661 --> 01:02:55.442]  I've seen that.
[01:02:55.662 --> 01:02:56.403]  That I have seen.
[01:02:56.423 --> 01:02:57.764]  I've actually watched video on that.
[01:02:57.804 --> 01:03:01.226]  Of course, not with his face, but, you know, other videos of Skull and Bones.
[01:03:01.286 --> 01:03:03.148]  No, because they don't take their black hoods off.
[01:03:03.672 --> 01:03:04.072]  That's right.
[01:03:04.092 --> 01:03:05.553]  You know, like the SWAT teams.
[01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:06.933]  You go, show us their faces.
[01:03:07.233 --> 01:03:07.493]  Yeah.
[01:03:07.713 --> 01:03:13.235]  When we go into court about a SWAT team blowing a child in half, they go, well, what was the badge number?
[01:03:13.655 --> 01:03:14.795]  Whose face was it?
[01:03:16.116 --> 01:03:18.637]  And then we have a little problem, like bank robbers do.
[01:03:19.857 --> 01:03:22.598]  Okay, can I get back into the issue of Christianity now?
[01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:23.298]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:03:24.618 --> 01:03:25.899]  I've been raised Pentecostal.
[01:03:26.119 --> 01:03:32.781]  Let me just get right to the point here, and I don't mean for this to be offensive in any way, believe me, but I think that, you know...
[01:03:33.732 --> 01:03:35.974]  Well, look, I'm not asking you to hop on board.
[01:03:36.094 --> 01:03:41.659]  You should investigate what we're talking about and do what you feel is right, okay?
[01:04:00.356 --> 01:04:01.477]  I mean, it's real simple.
[01:04:01.738 --> 01:04:07.024]  And your parents loved you and didn't want you to end up in prison or on heroin, probably.
[01:04:08.105 --> 01:04:12.409]  They were probably scared to death of the world getting you and destroying you.
[01:04:16.254 --> 01:04:16.954]  Thanks for the call.
[01:04:17.115 --> 01:04:18.176]  We'll be back with our guest.

[01:05:21.235 --> 01:05:25.558]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:25.738 --> 01:05:30.181]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:30.321 --> 01:05:34.684]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.

[01:05:37.859 --> 01:05:42.082]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[01:07:17.856 --> 01:07:18.958]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.802]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:24.383 --> 01:07:27.166]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:34.315 --> 01:07:35.356]  All right.
[01:07:36.497 --> 01:07:46.724]  Over the years, we've had filmmaker Tito Howard on, who is an investigative reporter, and made the film Loss of Liberty.
[01:07:46.764 --> 01:07:53.469]  We've had, with Mr. Howard, on some of the survivors of the USS Liberty.
[01:07:54.710 --> 01:08:02.096]  And he's really been a focal point in getting a lot of the victims, the heroes, together concerning this subject.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:22.586]  And now that a new book came out propagandizing about how it was a big accident by Israel on June 8, 1967 to attack the USS Liberty in international waters and torpedo it and napalm it and white phosphor it and shoot it with cannons and strafe the lifeboats for hours.
[01:08:23.686 --> 01:08:25.887]  And when this new book came out whitewashing it,
[01:08:28.254 --> 01:08:44.184]  Captain Ward Boston, who we're getting on the show later this week, Senior Legal Counsel for the Navy's Court of Inquiry into the attack on the Liberty, his statement was read by Rear Admiral Merlin, starring a former Judge Advocate General of the Navy, following her portions of what he said.
[01:08:44.244 --> 01:08:45.105]  We'll go over that.
[01:08:47.026 --> 01:08:55.832]  And he also talks about how he was there with LBJ and McNamara and told to cover up the fact that Israel attacked the ship on purpose.
[01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:58.691]  And again, we've talked to a lot of the survivors on the show.
[01:08:58.711 --> 01:09:03.192]  We're setting them back up for the show to go over this later this week.
[01:09:04.293 --> 01:09:05.773]  It's clear that the U.S.
[01:09:05.934 --> 01:09:17.878]  government was in control of that ship, knew it was going to happen, and wanted it to be sunk, turned the fighter jets back when the ship called for help because they wanted that ship to sink, all aboard to be killed, to blame it on Egypt.
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:19.621]  We're good to go.
[01:09:19.641 --> 01:09:20.081]  I think?
[01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:46.496]  And joining us is the documentary filmmaker Tito Howard, who again is lining up for us a bunch of folks.
[01:09:46.516 --> 01:09:48.077]  We've had Admiral Moore on before.
[01:09:48.137 --> 01:09:51.279]  We've had a bunch of the people on board the ship on the show.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.361]  But we're going to be having more of them up this week.
[01:09:53.401 --> 01:10:00.005]  But somebody who's very articulate, done some of the best research, is Tito Howard, this investigative journalist and the maker of The Loss of Liberty.
[01:10:00.506 --> 01:10:01.827]  Thanks for coming on the show, Tito.
[01:10:01.847 --> 01:10:05.289]  I don't know what you left for me to talk about.
[01:10:05.309 --> 01:10:08.151]  It's good to be back on with you, Alex.
[01:10:08.644 --> 01:10:14.409]  It's great to have you here, and any word yet on what day this week we're going to be able to have some more of the folks on?
[01:10:14.929 --> 01:10:19.673]  Well, I'm going to be meeting the admirals tomorrow afternoon and let them know what's happening.
[01:10:19.813 --> 01:10:26.398]  These are fighters, but they're older fighters, and I just need to coordinate things smoothly for them.
[01:10:26.418 --> 01:10:29.681]  But you and I will talk about it later this afternoon, perhaps.
[01:10:30.241 --> 01:10:30.742]  Absolutely.
[01:10:30.762 --> 01:10:33.584]  What about the Captain Boston?
[01:10:33.884 --> 01:10:35.986]  Oh, yes, I think he's critical to this now.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:36.960]  We're good to go.
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:37.381]  I think?
[01:11:07.331 --> 01:11:07.911]  I filmed it.
[01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:09.932]  I'll have some copies ready by Thursday.
[01:11:09.972 --> 01:11:11.993]  I'll send you out one, because it's powerful.
[01:11:12.593 --> 01:11:33.101]  And then having a former Judge Advocate General of the Navy, who also had very close, insightful knowledge of the liberty thing, who went on to become first Chief Navy Lawyer to the Secretary of the Navy.
[01:11:33.121 --> 01:11:35.142]  That's Rear Admiral Merlin Starring.
[01:11:35.202 --> 01:11:35.762]  That's right.
[01:11:36.465 --> 01:11:41.028]  And this man speaks in a very clear, strong voice.
[01:11:41.509 --> 01:11:49.294]  And him reading Captain Boston's affidavit, we got him to sign it in the form of an affidavit.
[01:11:50.074 --> 01:11:51.736]  And this is what made it newsworthy.
[01:11:52.016 --> 01:12:01.362]  I knew we had scored when Associated Press on their web page had this 36-year-old story under latest news.
[01:12:02.103 --> 01:12:04.004]  And Ward Boston is the reason for that.
[01:12:04.591 --> 01:12:07.174]  Now, I've got an AP, I've got a Washington Post, I've got a Newsmax article here.
[01:12:20.525 --> 01:12:31.187]  According to his quotes, that he was there in the room with Johnson and McNamara telling him, you cover this up.
[01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:32.467]  That is massive.
[01:12:32.487 --> 01:12:33.627]  It is massive, yeah.
[01:12:33.727 --> 01:12:41.809]  And Isaac Kidd had indicated to some other people, some crew members and others, that it should be investigated more.
[01:12:41.869 --> 01:12:43.349]  I think it haunted him.
[01:12:43.389 --> 01:12:47.130]  He wound up a four-star admiral and was generally well-liked.
[01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:49.610]  I think that was the one stain on him.
[01:12:50.522 --> 01:12:57.808]  And, you know, his father was a great American sailor who was killed on the Arizona at Pearl Harbor in 1941.
[01:12:58.868 --> 01:13:08.536]  And so, I mean, there's so much historicity into this, but Moore raised some very important things that were not in the actual documents.
[01:13:08.576 --> 01:13:10.978]  We put together a thing of the findings.
[01:13:11.558 --> 01:13:17.983]  These were 12 separate findings that all of the people on this commission signed
[01:13:18.444 --> 01:13:22.485]  With the exception of Ray Davis, he died on September 3rd.
[01:13:22.525 --> 01:13:29.107]  He was a four-star Marine general and very critical on some of the findings and other things that we put together.
[01:13:29.147 --> 01:13:29.788]  We miss him.
[01:13:29.868 --> 01:13:32.268]  Now, Tito Howard, I want to make it clear.
[01:13:32.308 --> 01:13:34.049]  When I do make a mistake, I'm the first to admit it.
[01:13:34.685 --> 01:13:34.805]  Good.
[01:13:34.825 --> 01:13:35.045]  Oh, my God.
[01:14:03.661 --> 01:14:14.590]  For those that just joined us, before we get into the findings and what Captain Boston has said on the record, for those that just joined us, what happened to the USS Liberty in 1967?
[01:14:16.211 --> 01:14:22.356]  Well, the Liberty was our best intelligence ship, probably the best in the world.
[01:14:23.237 --> 01:14:26.660]  It had a moon-bounce dish on the back, on a tall structure.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:32.064]  It had eight 40-foot whip antennas, totally...
[01:14:34.027 --> 01:14:37.888]  Different, with its topside configuration, any ship in the world.
[01:14:38.468 --> 01:14:39.709]  And this was perfect weather.
[01:14:40.529 --> 01:14:49.991]  The Liberty was under the surveillance of Israeli aircraft 13 different times, starting at 6 in the morning and stopping shortly after noon on the 8th of June.
[01:14:51.092 --> 01:14:56.513]  And a little after 2 o'clock, about 2.05, the Liberty was attacked by a total of
[01:14:57.333 --> 01:15:00.634]  At least 12 Israeli unmarked aircraft.
[01:15:00.654 --> 01:15:15.080]  The only time that I know of where Israeli forces used unmarked aircraft in any of their wars, but they did on the Liberty, which certainly helps to indicate what kind of an attack it was.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:21.062]  Now, the Liberty was pounded for about 25 minutes by these planes.
[01:15:21.102 --> 01:15:22.363]  There were probably eight
[01:15:23.491 --> 01:15:27.733]  At the time, one of the better combat aircraft in the world.
[01:15:28.293 --> 01:15:31.094]  And the second was also French-built, the Super Mystere.
[01:15:31.134 --> 01:15:33.435]  Slower, but a much heavier bomb load.
[01:15:33.495 --> 01:15:42.698]  And it was the Super Mysteres that dropped at least six containers of napalm and an additional thing of white phosphorus on the ship.
[01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:50.961]  And Larry Weaver, one of the survivors who lives now in California, still has to wear white gloves for the phosphorus burns on his hand.
[01:15:51.361 --> 01:15:52.602]  It was an outrageous attack.
[01:15:53.174 --> 01:16:01.277]  And then the motor torpedo boats arrived at about 2.37, if memory serves me correct.
[01:16:01.397 --> 01:16:07.839]  And they fired six torpedoes at the Liberty, only one hit.
[01:16:07.899 --> 01:16:14.941]  And that was, you know, this is the Israeli Army and Navy that was very, very highly rated.
[01:16:14.961 --> 01:16:22.223]  The Air Force had done an incredibly powerful job on wiping out the Egyptian Air Force on the ground on
[01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:24.231]  The morning of June the 5th.
[01:16:25.031 --> 01:16:37.837]  So the Liberty then, while the air attack was going on, the attacking Israeli aircraft were jamming all five of our American emergency radio signals.
[01:16:38.578 --> 01:16:45.921]  But the crew, incredibly brave, able crew, and of course there's always some that panic under attack situations.
[01:16:45.981 --> 01:16:47.722]  Most of these guys had not seen panic.
[01:16:48.322 --> 01:16:49.823]  I mean, had not seen combat, but
[01:16:50.933 --> 01:16:54.696]  The main players in it were absolute heroes.
[01:16:55.657 --> 01:17:05.165]  And George Golden down in the engine room, and Captain McGonagall on the bridge, and people like Smitty...
[01:17:08.168 --> 01:17:12.672]  There was a 30-foot hole, correct, through both sides of the torpedo?
[01:17:12.692 --> 01:17:13.953]  40 by 42 feet.
[01:17:14.113 --> 01:17:14.753]  Oh, 42 feet.
[01:17:14.793 --> 01:17:15.354]  Excuse me.
[01:17:15.394 --> 01:17:16.895]  Yeah, and only one of them hit.
[01:17:16.995 --> 01:17:21.118]  And the interesting thing about that is... Wasn't there 700 cannon holes, too?
[01:17:21.998 --> 01:17:27.282]  No, there were 821 cannon and missile holes and over 3,000 holes by armored-piercing missiles.
[01:17:32.075 --> 01:17:33.576]  50 caliber machine gun bullets.
[01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:37.057]  Okay, my memory wasn't serving, but you said the interesting part about the torpedo.
[01:17:37.117 --> 01:17:37.517]  Go ahead.
[01:17:37.557 --> 01:17:38.697]  Yeah.
[01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:45.980]  This is why I think that if there ever was divine intervention, this is a good example of it.
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:54.143]  Here the crack Israeli military misses in perfect weather on a 460 foot long ship, misses with five.
[01:17:54.863 --> 01:18:00.005]  The one that does it, it's one of the ribs that holds the superstructure together.
[01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:06.111]  And otherwise it would have gone into the ship, exploded, probably blown the ship in half.
[01:18:07.151 --> 01:18:13.273]  And so hitting the rib, and if anyone had hit even another rib or anywhere else, the ship would have gone down.
[01:18:13.293 --> 01:18:15.153]  It's a miracle it survived.
[01:18:15.754 --> 01:18:30.278]  And we need to think of the geopolitical inference of that, too, because if the Liberty had survived, the Israelis would still be in control of the entire Sinai Peninsula.
[01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:36.937]  Which would have created serious problems in addition to the ones that are going on.
[01:18:36.997 --> 01:18:44.641]  Now, from having you guys on last time, you all agreed, going from memory here, correct me if I'm wrong, that it was to be blamed on Egypt.
[01:18:44.901 --> 01:18:45.201]  Sure.
[01:18:45.361 --> 01:18:49.924]  And again, it was the grace of God that that didn't happen because that would have been World War III with the Russians.
[01:18:50.284 --> 01:18:55.967]  Well, I'm not sure if the Russians would have gambled, but they were getting concerned because they were getting embarrassed and
[01:18:56.758 --> 01:19:03.105]  And Syria and Egypt were two Arab countries where they had, you know, some influence.
[01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:12.014]  But we have to remember that just six years after this war in 67, that the... Say what, Tito?
[01:19:12.054 --> 01:19:12.415]  Stay there.
[01:19:12.435 --> 01:19:15.858]  We'll continue to cover this to get in the latest developments and take calls.
[01:19:15.878 --> 01:19:18.681]  We're talking about the USS Liberty and the new developments.
[01:19:18.701 --> 01:19:19.322]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:21.503 --> 01:19:24.764]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:24.824 --> 01:19:29.005]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:19:29.245 --> 01:19:32.046]  But if you placed them on a magnet, all would stick.
[01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:34.647]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:19:34.827 --> 01:19:43.469]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:45.030]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:19:45.190 --> 01:19:49.411]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:19:49.791 --> 01:20:03.626]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:20:03.806 --> 01:20:10.293]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:17.838]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:21:20.444 --> 01:21:24.347]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:21:24.567 --> 01:21:36.856]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:21:37.276 --> 01:21:37.676]  The U.S.
[01:21:37.736 --> 01:21:43.300]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:45.922]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:21:47.771 --> 01:21:48.251]  We're good to go.
[01:22:15.704 --> 01:22:15.985]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:23.953]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:24.613]  Yes.
[01:22:24.894 --> 01:22:29.697]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[01:22:29.817 --> 01:22:38.744]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[01:22:38.884 --> 01:22:46.610]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:48.712]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[01:22:48.712 --> 01:22:49.272]  We're good to go.
[01:23:21.369 --> 01:23:24.911]  We're good to go.
[01:23:45.606 --> 01:23:53.011]  We're going to have some of the survivors back on the show, and hopefully some of the admirals that we haven't had on.
[01:23:53.031 --> 01:24:05.700]  We've had Admiral Moore on, as well as Captain Boston, who was involved in the cover-up in the whitewash for Johnson, and has firsthand in the Oval Office testimony that he's now signed an affidavit.
[01:24:06.701 --> 01:24:08.222]  That's why the media cannot ignore it.
[01:24:09.594 --> 01:24:11.876]  Tito Howard, there's so many facets to this.
[01:24:11.936 --> 01:24:14.638]  I mean, after the attack took place, we're going to get back into the attack.
[01:24:15.059 --> 01:24:16.000]  You have the cover-up.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:18.962]  You have the people being told you'll be arrested if you tell anybody about this.
[01:24:19.442 --> 01:24:23.426]  You have the secret ceremony giving the captain the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[01:24:24.735 --> 01:24:24.856]  T-Dub.
[01:24:52.096 --> 01:24:53.657]  Going from two events.
[01:24:53.717 --> 01:24:57.360]  We had the one in the Rayburn building on the 22nd of October.
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:03.344]  And that's what got the AP story, UPI story.
[01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:07.887]  It was in a lot of newspapers and picked up by a lot of radio talk shows.
[01:25:09.208 --> 01:25:10.349]  But it's still alive.
[01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:16.933]  And the approach by the pro-Israeli lobby has been to ignore it to death.
[01:25:16.953 --> 01:25:19.175]  But they are really scared of this story.
[01:25:19.675 --> 01:25:21.837]  Because if there ever is an investigation...
[01:25:22.366 --> 01:25:25.388]  It'll be very clear that this was premeditated and deliberate.
[01:25:26.088 --> 01:25:29.270]  And as Admiral Moore said, a very strong voice.
[01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:36.514]  This is an ex-chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff and probably the greatest living American admiral.
[01:25:36.534 --> 01:25:42.437]  He said, why would our government put Israel's interests above our own?
[01:25:43.311 --> 01:25:46.494]  Somebody's going to have to answer all that in one of these days.
[01:25:46.554 --> 01:25:48.116]  Well, look, we know the U.S.
[01:25:48.156 --> 01:26:02.610]  government, the British government, the Chinese government, they do bad things, and it's okay to criticize them, but when you get into Israel, they try to paint anybody as a wicked devil who does this, but they're going to have trouble with all these heroes, and after they've engaged in this cover-up,
[01:26:03.186 --> 01:26:06.008]  But again, expanding this discussion, it's obvious the U.S.
[01:26:06.028 --> 01:26:07.690]  government had taken control of that ship.
[01:26:08.190 --> 01:26:09.391]  The presidency had.
[01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.012]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[01:26:11.553 --> 01:26:13.234]  It's obvious they turned the jets back.
[01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:19.059]  And from past discussions, would you agree, Tito, that it's clear that they wanted that ship to go down?
[01:26:19.099 --> 01:26:23.322]  This was part of a larger plan to have the pretext to blame it on Egypt?
[01:26:23.963 --> 01:26:25.544]  I think that that's true.
[01:26:25.604 --> 01:26:30.308]  And one of the real evidences of that is that...
[01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:34.129]  The Israelis attacked the ship with unmarked planes.
[01:26:34.369 --> 01:26:43.234]  The people on board the Liberty, being pounded from all these different directions, couldn't see any insignia or national identification.
[01:26:43.935 --> 01:26:52.220]  So if the Liberty didn't know, how did Washington know to force the recall the plane sent to help Americans in trouble?
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:56.623]  And after the heroes on board the USS Liberty, and there were many,
[01:26:58.035 --> 01:27:04.559]  The first American hero not on board was Joe Tully, the skipper of the Saratoga.
[01:27:04.579 --> 01:27:09.523]  We had two large carriers with the 6th Fleet and 67, the Saratoga and the American.
[01:27:10.463 --> 01:27:12.184]  And they immediately launched.
[01:27:12.224 --> 01:27:17.908]  By immediately, I mean within eight or nine minutes from getting the call through from the Liberty.
[01:27:17.928 --> 01:27:26.433]  And the Liberty guys, the radio men, Rocky Sturman, Terry Albardier, and others, there were some really smart people
[01:27:27.014 --> 01:27:36.678]  That figured out that the attacking Israeli aircraft were jamming all five of the emergency American signals.
[01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:46.762]  But that when they were firing missiles, they had to cut the thing that was jamming it because it would have prematurely triggered the missiles.
[01:27:47.442 --> 01:27:55.605]  It was in that little tiny window that they got through to the Saratoga and later to the America, and the Saratoga launched.
[01:27:56.286 --> 01:27:59.987]  And those planes were called back, although the Liberty was still under attack.
[01:28:00.067 --> 01:28:12.529]  And that's when the second great hero, not counting the men on the ship, Admiral Larry Geis, who was the carrier division commander, not in tactical command of the 6th Fleet, that was Admiral Martin.
[01:28:13.289 --> 01:28:16.670]  But he would not go along with the order to recall.
[01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:22.631]  And so first McNamara called me.
[01:28:22.651 --> 01:28:24.171]  And we just got this interview.
[01:28:25.498 --> 01:28:36.704]  With a Mr. Hart who was in Port Loyote, Morocco, and had the responsibility to connect and keep on the line Secretary McNamara and Carry Division Commander Geis.
[01:28:37.625 --> 01:28:43.428]  And Geis was refusing to recall the planes because he said, but the Liberty's still under attack.
[01:28:43.448 --> 01:28:45.169]  If the attack stops, we recall them.
[01:28:45.909 --> 01:28:48.891]  And McNamara insisted, and then...
[01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:51.350]  Guys just wouldn't go for it.
[01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:55.293]  Then McNamara said, we're not going to war over a bunch of dead sailors.
[01:28:56.094 --> 01:28:58.075]  Imagine how that would play in the Navy.
[01:28:58.095 --> 01:29:00.377]  McNamara needs to be arrested right now.
[01:29:00.818 --> 01:29:01.418]  It's outrageous.
[01:29:01.658 --> 01:29:03.460]  He's an absolute piece of trash.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.742]  These are new developments with Tito Howard.
[01:29:06.222 --> 01:29:07.643]  These are signed affidavits.
[01:29:07.683 --> 01:29:10.205]  We'll be back with more of these bombshell revelations.
[01:29:11.766 --> 01:29:12.687]  We're on the march.
[01:29:13.168 --> 01:29:14.789]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:15.710 --> 01:29:18.412]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:21.647 --> 01:29:22.127]  We're good to go.

[01:29:45.467 --> 01:29:47.929]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water.
[01:29:48.250 --> 01:29:55.395]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you to homeostasis.
[01:29:55.695 --> 01:29:59.378]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.

[01:31:32.523 --> 01:31:40.105]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:31:40.345 --> 01:31:49.539]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:55.949]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:31:56.309 --> 01:32:00.190]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:02.150]  The water level is always visible.
[01:32:02.331 --> 01:32:08.252]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.

[01:32:22.001 --> 01:32:27.622]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:30.563 --> 01:32:45.167]  Again, my friends, we've had Tito Howard, investigative journalist, researcher, and many of the victims, the heroes of the USS Liberty dastardly attack of 1967 during the Six-Day War.
[01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:49.768]  On the show, we're going to do a couple more hours on this later this week with...
[01:32:50.675 --> 01:32:54.916]  Some of the admirals and captains and others that have been blowing the whistle and some of the survivors.
[01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:58.077]  I want to get a bunch of these folks on and we're setting it up right now.
[01:32:59.557 --> 01:33:04.459]  But there have now been new developments.
[01:33:06.519 --> 01:33:08.980]  And in these new developments...
[01:33:10.399 --> 01:33:22.084]  We don't just have the evidence of the unmarked planes attacking and then strafing the people in the live boats in the water and the assault helicopters coming with the special forces to finish off the job and finally turning back.
[01:33:22.804 --> 01:33:33.069]  Now we have the radio operator connecting McNamara's phone call in with one of the admirals who was refusing to turn back the aircraft.
[01:33:33.089 --> 01:33:37.371]  We also have Captain Boston, who was in the White House...
[01:33:38.231 --> 01:33:42.033]  During the whitewash, when LBJ and McNamara said, cover this up.
[01:33:42.534 --> 01:33:45.175]  Tito Howard, let's continue with these new revelations.
[01:33:46.355 --> 01:33:47.416]  Where are you left off?
[01:33:47.756 --> 01:33:49.397]  Recapping that and then continuing it.
[01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.199]  This is an amazing development.
[01:33:52.379 --> 01:33:53.999]  Oh, it is indeed.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.160]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:57.341]  The one thing is that didn't happen in the White House.
[01:33:57.421 --> 01:34:00.503]  It happened in Malta, in Naples.
[01:34:01.343 --> 01:34:02.684]  It happened on board the Liberty.
[01:34:03.777 --> 01:34:12.383]  Libri from the 8th to the 13th was limping at five knots to get into dry dock and get repaired.
[01:34:13.303 --> 01:34:24.250]  And that's when he had those contacts with Admiral Kidd, who was the president of the Navy Board of Inquiry.
[01:34:24.991 --> 01:34:27.252]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:34:27.332 --> 01:34:29.794]  I'm mixing two different instances together.
[01:34:30.583 --> 01:34:32.144]  Because we got cut off in the break.
[01:34:32.184 --> 01:34:41.989]  You were talking, Tito Howard, you were discussing the radio transmission during the attack from McNamara to the Admiral.
[01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:44.550]  Yeah, Larry Geist, the carry division commander.
[01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:57.216]  And it's interesting because Geist never did agree to do that from McNamara, and the commander in the field, he doesn't agree with the order, has the right to ask the next higher-up.
[01:34:57.256 --> 01:34:59.417]  Well, after the Secretary of Defense, it's the President.
[01:35:00.097 --> 01:35:00.498]  We're good to go.
[01:35:12.197 --> 01:35:15.019]  Let me stop you right there, because we got interrupted by a break.
[01:35:15.059 --> 01:35:16.599]  I want you to start back over.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.420]  This is so important, Tito.
[01:35:18.861 --> 01:35:19.481]  It is.
[01:35:19.661 --> 01:35:32.468]  With the ships under attack, the radio operators figure out that they're being jammed, but that they have to turn off the powerful jamming transmission to fire their missiles, because that could interfere with it.
[01:35:32.728 --> 01:35:33.909]  Let's start over from there.
[01:35:33.969 --> 01:35:35.309]  They get the distress signal out.
[01:35:35.349 --> 01:35:36.070]  What happens next?
[01:35:36.490 --> 01:35:40.352]  Okay, Joe Tully, the skipper of the Saratoga, launches.
[01:35:41.381 --> 01:35:44.122]  And Don Engen was the skipper of the America.
[01:35:44.142 --> 01:35:46.402]  He was Captain Engen in those days.
[01:35:46.462 --> 01:35:52.844]  He retired as a two-star ad when I knew him, when he was the director of the Air and Space Museum in Washington.
[01:35:52.904 --> 01:35:53.804]  Very bright guy.
[01:35:54.444 --> 01:35:59.906]  But he had it wrong on Liberty, and I just slowly turned him in the first three meetings we had.
[01:35:59.926 --> 01:36:09.328]  And I was going to do an interview with him on August 8th, a couple of years ago, and he was killed in a glider crash in Nevada three weeks before.
[01:36:10.379 --> 01:36:13.361]  Anyway, let me get back to the other, because the breaking thing is important.
[01:36:13.381 --> 01:36:34.074]  Here is Ward Boston, who had an exemplary career in the Judge Advocate General Corps, and we have Merlin Starring, the only other high Navy legal official who was the chief legal officer for Admiral John Sidney McCain, Jr., the commander-in-chief of U.S.
[01:36:34.114 --> 01:36:36.476]  Navy Europe, which encompassed the Mediterranean,
[01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:40.091]  He's the senator's father.
[01:36:40.151 --> 01:36:41.571]  Yeah, that's John McCain's daddy.
[01:36:41.771 --> 01:36:42.271]  That's right.
[01:36:42.331 --> 01:36:43.591]  John Sidney McCain Jr.
[01:36:43.651 --> 01:36:48.792]  So he was a great admiral in a lot of ways, but he got caught up in the political thing here.
[01:36:49.972 --> 01:37:01.814]  And, you know, trying to cover up... And my favorite line in my film I wrote at 3 o'clock in the morning in the doctor, Richard Kiefer, who was an incredibly tough and brave man in 1967.
[01:37:01.954 --> 01:37:02.014]  And...
[01:37:05.672 --> 01:37:16.782]  The ability to get that much power on a ship and have the ship survive just spoiled a lot of people's plans.
[01:37:17.403 --> 01:37:22.608]  But now we have... Oh, wait, the line I was going to give, because it's a powerful line.
[01:37:23.168 --> 01:37:31.376]  I wrote it at 3 in the morning, and what the line was, Never before in American military history has a military board of inquiry...
[01:37:32.202 --> 01:37:39.284]  ...ignored the eyewitness testimony of American military and taken on faith the word of their attackers.
[01:37:39.924 --> 01:37:42.345]  And Dr. Kiefer delivers it in the film, I think, very well.
[01:37:43.165 --> 01:37:46.506]  So we've got a lot of things.
[01:37:46.526 --> 01:37:59.069]  But now to get back toward Boston, let me just read, if you'll give me a couple of minutes to read, just a couple of quotes from this affidavit, which is the news-breaking thing.
[01:38:00.284 --> 01:38:17.112]  I know from personal conversations I had with Admiral Kidd that President Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ordered him to conclude that the attack was a case of mistaken identity despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
[01:38:18.713 --> 01:38:29.138]  And he says it is important for the American people to know that it is clear that Israel is responsible for deliberately attacking an American ship and murdering American sailors.
[01:38:30.407 --> 01:38:37.232]  And so, you know, incredible breakthrough that this guy would say this 36 years later.
[01:38:38.093 --> 01:38:49.501]  And a pro-Israeli retired Navy captain, Jay Crystal, wrote this book, which is a total whitewash and infuriated this guy.
[01:38:49.581 --> 01:38:55.706]  I saw Captain Boston back in February, and I have him on film saying these things.
[01:38:56.166 --> 01:38:58.788]  So, I mean, we'll save it for posterity.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:26.933]  And to have the man who was in London at the time and the chief Navy legal advisor to Admiral McCain to come out and read it and talk about he was taken out of the whole loop of judicial review, which is almost unheard of in the Navy, because, in his words, he was having serious problems with the evidentiary support
[01:39:27.651 --> 01:39:32.354]  of the Navy Board of Inquiry.
[01:39:32.394 --> 01:39:33.515]  That's powerful stuff.
[01:39:34.155 --> 01:39:39.639]  And we did that on Capitol Hill in the main Congressional Office building.
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:47.284]  And then last Wednesday, Admiral Starring and I spoke to the Exchange Club in Washington, D.C.
[01:39:47.364 --> 01:39:47.885]  in the U.S.
[01:39:47.925 --> 01:39:48.265]  Senate.
[01:39:48.965 --> 01:39:52.788]  And they're all admirals and generals that I met in that group.
[01:39:53.188 --> 01:39:57.111]  So we have some real momentum, and I'm glad, Alex, that you're picking it up.
[01:39:57.952 --> 01:40:01.755]  With the same insightful coverage that you did before.
[01:40:02.476 --> 01:40:15.946]  And I think we, and your people, should, the ones that don't have a copy of the film, just write to Liberty Alliance, Box 663, Front Royal, Virginia, 22630.
[01:40:15.986 --> 01:40:18.028]  They're $25 a piece, but they're $50 for three.
[01:40:18.068 --> 01:40:19.789]  And then you get the findings, and there's
[01:40:27.225 --> 01:40:32.869]  Also, the 20 most commonly asked questions about the USS Liberty, and we send all of that in the package.
[01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:52.383]  And I would also recommend that people, because ultimately we're going to have to win this information battle in the trenches, which means American Legion posts, VFW posts, Veterans for Peace, and get them committed, because this is a story a long time ago, and when
[01:40:52.967 --> 01:40:59.708]  When Admiral Starring and I spoke at the Exchange Club on Capitol Hill last Wednesday, it was amazing to me.
[01:40:59.768 --> 01:41:01.429]  I'm standing up there talking to these people.
[01:41:01.449 --> 01:41:09.930]  They're believing us because it's blessed by Admiral Moore, and they all know who he is, and he's greatly admired by all military people that I've talked to.
[01:41:10.490 --> 01:41:15.151]  And here's Merlin Starring and Nick Jagg, and they're reading the thing from Captain Boston.
[01:41:15.911 --> 01:41:18.552]  So they believed it, but they didn't know the truth.
[01:41:18.592 --> 01:41:19.832]  I'm talking about admirals.
[01:41:20.372 --> 01:41:21.012]  It's amazing.
[01:41:21.474 --> 01:41:21.694]  I think.
[01:41:48.308 --> 01:41:53.899]  Before we go to Darren and Mike and others that are patiently holding, and the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:41:53.919 --> 01:41:55.923]  We got interrupted by that break 12 minutes ago.
[01:42:01.173 --> 01:42:18.000]  And that was so important, what you were getting into with the gentleman relaying the call, listening to the call from McNamara, and then LBJ getting on the phone during the attack, telling the Admiral, you turned that second group of planes back.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.121]  Can you recap that and go over that?
[01:42:20.141 --> 01:42:21.941]  Because you were still talking when we hit the break.
[01:42:21.981 --> 01:42:30.025]  Yes, because it is a critical part of the story, and the part that has Moore and some of these admirals most upset.
[01:42:30.085 --> 01:42:30.505]  I mean, here...
[01:42:31.588 --> 01:42:37.232]  To use Admiral Moore's words, he said, those sailors and Marines, there were three Marines on Liberty, two of them were killed.
[01:42:37.252 --> 01:42:43.655]  He said, those sailors and Marines deserved our best defense, and we gave them no defense.
[01:42:44.236 --> 01:42:47.558]  That's powerful for the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
[01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:55.823]  Well, we lost his phone line, and that happens sometimes.
[01:42:56.883 --> 01:42:57.604]  Are you back, Tito?
[01:42:59.526 --> 01:43:00.607]  We're going to get him back.
[01:43:01.047 --> 01:43:03.468]  That happens a lot with these type of interviews.
[01:43:05.569 --> 01:43:06.109]  Oh, boy.
[01:43:06.649 --> 01:43:19.475]  And let me just read what Captain Boston, the most stunning revelation was a statement by Captain Ward Boston, the Senior Legal Counsel for the Navy's Court of Inquiry into the attack on Liberty.
[01:43:19.815 --> 01:43:27.318]  This statement was read by Rear Admiral Merlin Starring, a former Judge Advocate General of the Navy, following her portions of what he read.
[01:43:27.338 --> 01:43:28.739]  This is right next door to the Capitol.
[01:43:29.659 --> 01:43:30.420]  I think we're good to go.
[01:43:43.863 --> 01:43:44.323]  We're good to go.
[01:44:04.578 --> 01:44:11.301]  The ship is American, riddled with bullet holes, and heard testimony that made it clear that the Israelis intended that there be no survivors.
[01:44:11.361 --> 01:44:24.607]  Not only did the Israelis attack the ship for over two hours with napalm, gunfire and hundreds of rockets and missiles, Israeli torpedo boats with machine guns, three lifeboats that had been launched in an attempt to save the crew, a war crime.
[01:44:26.514 --> 01:44:34.621]  After saying he was moved to speak out after the book titled The Liberty Incident by Jay Crystal, he described it as an attempt to whitewash the facts.
[01:44:34.661 --> 01:44:38.924]  He then dropped a bombshell saying, I have first-hand knowledge from many personnel.
[01:44:40.285 --> 01:44:54.917]  Again, I have first-hand knowledge from many personal conversations with Admiral Kidd, the President Lyndon Johnson, and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara personally ordered him to cover up the true facts and conclude that the attack was a case of mistaken identity despite overwhelming evidence.
[01:44:55.217 --> 01:44:55.958]  To the contrary...
[01:44:56.767 --> 01:45:02.692]  Again, LBJ also rescinded an order to send carrier-based fighter planes that were only 15 minutes away to defend the Liberty.
[01:45:11.221 --> 01:45:12.342]  Let's get this out again.
[01:45:12.362 --> 01:45:24.153]  During the attack, McNamara, LBJ, on the phone with the Admiral, out there in the Mediterranean, from Washington, and you have witnesses that were transferring the call, listening to it in Navy Intelligence.
[01:45:24.533 --> 01:45:25.454]  You have these witnesses.
[01:45:25.674 --> 01:45:27.436]  I have it on film, even.
[01:45:27.776 --> 01:45:29.718]  You have it on film, even.
[01:45:29.878 --> 01:45:34.803]  In February, I'm going to be putting together a new version of the film with Captain Boston.
[01:45:35.555 --> 01:45:37.115]  And this man, Hart.
[01:45:37.395 --> 01:45:42.436]  Okay, well, repeat what Hart heard McNamara and LBJ say about that ship.
[01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:43.296]  Okay.
[01:45:44.577 --> 01:45:46.597]  No, it was McNamara.
[01:45:46.717 --> 01:45:50.098]  He only heard the conversation between McNamara and Larry Geist.
[01:45:50.178 --> 01:45:52.878]  Geist is the real hero in all of this.
[01:45:52.958 --> 01:45:55.139]  He and Joe Tully of the Saratoga.
[01:45:55.159 --> 01:45:59.059]  Okay, what conversation was it where LBJ says, I don't care?
[01:45:59.079 --> 01:46:02.360]  That was later because Admiral Geist, the carrier division commander,
[01:46:02.853 --> 01:46:05.695]  Had to write the challenging order to the next higher-up.
[01:46:06.075 --> 01:46:08.017]  That's when Lyndon Johnson got on the phone.
[01:46:08.057 --> 01:46:09.598]  Okay, let's make this clear, then.
[01:46:09.658 --> 01:46:11.199]  Go through that chain of events, please.
[01:46:11.399 --> 01:46:19.145]  Okay, the first contact went through Port Laodicea, because that handled from the Pentagon where McNamara was.
[01:46:19.626 --> 01:46:27.351]  So then Johnson came through, and that was routed some other way, so the same person did not hear both conversations.
[01:46:28.012 --> 01:46:32.295]  That conversation was told to David Lewis, who was the
[01:46:33.044 --> 01:46:50.973]  The chief American intelligence officer on board Liberty, that was our most sophisticated intelligence ship, and he had two-thirds of the people on board Liberty were intelligence people, mostly Navy, but three Marines and one civilian.
[01:46:51.873 --> 01:46:59.897]  And so they were... Let's see, you've got the first conversation...
[01:47:00.464 --> 01:47:02.665]  We have the guy on film who did that.
[01:47:02.705 --> 01:47:10.429]  The second conversation, David Lewis was Commander Lewis at the time and the Chief Intelligence Officer.
[01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:27.738]  And he was the highest ranking of the most seriously wounded, which were medevaced on the morning of the 9th from the Liberty, about 8.30 to 9 o'clock, to the America, which they had more doctors and doctors
[01:47:28.382 --> 01:47:36.325]  Although Dr. Kiefer was still going, the man had badly damaged legs, 11 pieces of shrapnel in his abdomen, which he kept together with a life jacket.
[01:47:36.365 --> 01:47:41.507]  The man stood on those legs and operated for 28 hours, and nobody's ever heard of him until our film.
[01:47:42.267 --> 01:47:52.390]  Anyway, then Johnson calls you, but through another routing, and it was Larry Geist telling this to David Lewis.
[01:47:53.071 --> 01:47:56.652]  And so it was David Lewis who waited until...
[01:47:57.285 --> 01:47:59.346]  Admiral Geist died, and then he told that.
[01:48:00.166 --> 01:48:01.726]  And so that's the second.
[01:48:02.006 --> 01:48:16.470]  In that conversation, Johnson was getting mad at this guy because he was refusing the President of the United States, who was trying to recall the planes, although how the hell did we know that it was Israelis at that time, you know, with unmarked planes?
[01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:17.471]  The Liberty didn't know it.
[01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:19.971]  And they're saying we're not going to embarrass our allies.
[01:48:20.011 --> 01:48:20.511]  That's right.
[01:48:20.991 --> 01:48:24.012]  He said, I don't care if the ship sinks and we lose all hands.
[01:48:24.052 --> 01:48:26.453]  We're not going to war and embarrass an ally.
[01:48:27.768 --> 01:48:28.688]  I mean, it's outrageous.
[01:48:28.989 --> 01:48:34.651]  You know, it's like his Gulf of Talk in Vietnam stuff, and just as deadly on a smaller scale.
[01:48:35.271 --> 01:48:40.573]  I mean, there were 70% casualties on the Liberties, the most decorated crew in the history of the United States.
[01:48:41.213 --> 01:48:43.794]  And the guys themselves have been battered all these years.
[01:48:44.275 --> 01:48:45.675]  Government turned their back on them.
[01:48:45.715 --> 01:48:47.576]  They were incredible heroes at the time.
[01:48:48.416 --> 01:48:54.219]  And, you know, some of them have heavy antidepressant drugs.
[01:48:54.259 --> 01:48:55.639]  Some of them even drink on time.
[01:48:55.679 --> 01:48:57.380]  I mean, it's terrible what's happened to these
[01:48:57.970 --> 01:48:59.230]  Great American heroes.
[01:48:59.531 --> 01:49:05.412]  And I've worked closely with them for a long time, and it's difficult.
[01:49:05.512 --> 01:49:09.394]  It's very difficult, and you have to understand things from their perspective.
[01:49:09.574 --> 01:49:13.475]  Now, going back to the first conversation with McNamara, calling back the aircraft.
[01:49:13.515 --> 01:49:14.515]  Again, how did that take place?
[01:49:15.756 --> 01:49:25.338]  No, McNamara, that was the first conversation, because Larry Geis had also launched, well, this time we already have 12 planes and four A-4s,
[01:49:28.939 --> 01:49:34.082]  You know, gasoline-equipped A-4s, because it was very far away in combat.
[01:49:34.202 --> 01:49:35.162]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:49:35.522 --> 01:49:35.822]  All right?
[01:49:36.243 --> 01:49:45.086]  So McNamara was trying to get Larry Geist to recall him, and Geist never did agree to do it.
[01:49:45.166 --> 01:49:47.407]  He insisted on speaking to President Johnson.
[01:49:47.427 --> 01:49:48.448]  He was the next higher-up.
[01:49:49.088 --> 01:49:51.589]  And even he was arguing with Johnson after that.
[01:49:52.316 --> 01:49:57.759]  And then Johnson said, I don't care, you know, if the ship sinks and we lose all hands, he's not going to embarrass us.
[01:49:57.839 --> 01:49:58.439]  I mean, look at this.
[01:49:58.479 --> 01:50:06.543]  We've got the President and the Defense Secretary managing this as the ship's under attack, and then the ship doesn't get aid until the next morning.
[01:50:06.723 --> 01:50:07.363]  That's correct.
[01:50:07.383 --> 01:50:15.827]  When we come back, I want to go to Darren and Mike and others that are patiently holding, and I want to go over the machine gunning of the liveboats.
[01:50:15.887 --> 01:50:16.708]  That's important.
[01:50:17.268 --> 01:50:19.229]  And then what happened in the whitewash afterwards.
[01:50:19.269 --> 01:50:19.669]  Stay with us.

[01:51:12.717 --> 01:51:17.679]  That's 800-255-1912 or send a money order for $69 to the ARC Institute.
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:18.060]  P.O.
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:20.941]  Box 1227 Jacksonville, Oregon 97530.
[01:51:21.561 --> 01:51:23.522]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:51:23.622 --> 01:51:34.328]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:34.708 --> 01:51:39.070]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:50.678]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:51.218 --> 01:51:58.063]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:58.483 --> 01:52:00.565]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:52:01.085 --> 01:52:06.069]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:52:06.369 --> 01:52:16.917]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:52:17.158 --> 01:52:17.978]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:52:21.721 --> 01:52:26.067]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:52:26.247 --> 01:52:30.653]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:30.814 --> 01:52:35.200]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:36.581]  The New World Order.
[01:52:37.282 --> 01:52:37.663]  Can emerge.
[01:52:38.364 --> 01:52:42.588]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:52:42.648 --> 01:52:49.596]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:52:49.716 --> 01:52:51.719]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:52.119 --> 01:53:02.427]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:53:02.708 --> 01:53:08.072]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:53:08.592 --> 01:53:11.234]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:53:11.334 --> 01:53:12.515]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:12.535 --> 01:53:12.976]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:53:12.996 --> 01:53:14.797]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:53:31.742 --> 01:53:40.706]  Folks, Alex Jones here, and our guest is going to stay another 30 minutes into the next hour so we have time to get to Darren and Mike and Elizabeth and Peter and Roger and others.
[01:53:42.247 --> 01:53:47.589]  Why is this story, 36 years later, such a big deal?
[01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:52.351]  Because in Operation Northwoods, the 1962 plan by L.L.
[01:53:52.371 --> 01:53:54.952]  Lemonser, it calls for blowing up U.S.
[01:53:55.012 --> 01:53:56.933]  ships and blaming it on foreign enemies.
[01:53:57.668 --> 01:53:58.308]  We're good to go.
[01:54:21.149 --> 01:54:22.971]  With unmarked planes, something Israel doesn't do.
[01:54:41.371 --> 01:54:42.872]  This is a big, big deal, folks.
[01:54:42.912 --> 01:54:46.134]  People say, oh, the government couldn't have allowed September 11th to take place.
[01:54:46.394 --> 01:54:47.215]  That's hogwash.
[01:54:47.235 --> 01:54:48.796]  You look at the evidence, it's obvious.
[01:54:48.836 --> 01:55:00.042]  The PNAC plan, written up by Cheney and Wolfowitz and Pearl and Jeb Bush, calls for terrorist attacks, says we need these to get people behind this New World Order.
[01:55:00.963 --> 01:55:04.605]  So you start adding all this together, it's very, very, very serious.
[01:55:04.625 --> 01:55:07.707]  Before we go back to Tito Howard and tell you how to get his great film,
[01:55:09.525 --> 01:55:15.706]  We need you to spread the word about this broadcast, to tell ten people a day about this show so we can reach millions more people.
[01:55:15.866 --> 01:55:24.328]  And we need you to get Matrix of Evil, my new film, with Congressman Ron Paul, Congresswoman McKinney, Frank Morales on the police state, Colonel Craig Roberts, myself.
[01:55:24.428 --> 01:55:30.810]  It's a great new film exposing what the New World Order is doing today using terrorism to scare us into submission.
[01:55:31.616 --> 01:55:33.877]  So get Matrix of Evil, $25.95.
[01:55:34.277 --> 01:55:36.098]  Order three or more of any of my ten videos.
[01:55:36.118 --> 01:55:38.739]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[01:55:39.399 --> 01:55:41.259]  The new book, Order Out of Chaos, is out.
[01:55:41.299 --> 01:55:42.720]  You really need to get it as well.
[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:44.921]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:55:45.281 --> 01:55:46.801]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:47.261 --> 01:55:48.622]  Order the videos.
[01:55:48.762 --> 01:55:53.264]  Call toll-free to get them.
[01:55:53.284 --> 01:55:53.944]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:55.044 --> 01:55:57.785]  Your purchase of these videos also makes this show possible.
[01:55:58.125 --> 01:55:59.486]  So it's very important you do that.
[01:55:59.506 --> 01:56:00.246]  But number one...
[01:56:00.894 --> 01:56:07.882]  Whether it's 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, Matrix of Evil, they're waking people up.
[01:56:08.002 --> 01:56:17.072]  And as a caveat to that, we have a 10-minute teaser from the 2-hour and 40-minute Police State 3 Total Enslavement now on Infowars.com for free download.
[01:56:17.333 --> 01:56:20.036]  So definitely email that out to folks and let people know it's available.
[01:56:20.576 --> 01:56:24.721]  So again, 888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:56:24.761 --> 01:56:25.962]  Get my videos, folks.
[01:56:26.002 --> 01:56:26.763]  Get them out to people.
[01:56:26.783 --> 01:56:27.925]  Make copies of them.
[01:56:37.856 --> 01:56:38.817]  Now, we're about to break.
[01:56:38.937 --> 01:56:46.243]  I promise we'll go straight to Dean and Darren, Mike, Elizabeth, Peter, Roger, everybody.
[01:56:46.303 --> 01:56:50.406]  But in the next minute and a half, Tito Howard and your film's incredible.
[01:56:50.806 --> 01:56:55.690]  How do folks get the video, Loss of Liberty, to know the truth?
[01:56:56.071 --> 01:56:59.073]  As you said in this information war, how do they do that?
[01:57:00.474 --> 01:57:01.355]  Well, we're...
[01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:06.862]  We're over the 8,000 mark in copies of the film.
[01:57:07.062 --> 01:57:14.485]  Television, except for community access and other limited things, has been absolutely deaf to us.
[01:57:16.886 --> 01:57:17.707]  But it's working.
[01:57:17.767 --> 01:57:20.868]  I mean, these recent events have really helped a lot.
[01:57:21.008 --> 01:57:24.550]  This story won't be told unless listeners take action and get this video.
[01:57:25.377 --> 01:57:29.739]  And particularly with friends that were in the military or understand the military.
[01:57:29.759 --> 01:57:31.820]  Tell folks the mailing address.
[01:57:31.901 --> 01:57:39.324]  It's outrageous that our government would protect the attackers that killed 34... Give them the mailing address.
[01:57:39.344 --> 01:57:40.205]  We've got 30 seconds.
[01:57:40.505 --> 01:57:43.246]  Okay, it is the Liberty Alliance.
[01:57:45.688 --> 01:57:48.409]  Box 663.
[01:57:50.210 --> 01:57:52.371]  Front Royal, Virginia.
[01:57:53.389 --> 01:57:56.610]  It's $25 for one copy, $50 for three.
[01:57:56.650 --> 01:57:57.591]  We pay the shipping.
[01:57:58.591 --> 01:58:01.672]  And you make checks payable to Howard Films.
[01:58:02.753 --> 01:58:03.893]  All right, Howard Films.
[01:58:03.913 --> 01:58:05.574]  We'll get that out again before you leave us.
[01:58:06.074 --> 01:58:09.075]  Third hour, your calls and more on the Liberty when we get back.
[01:58:11.957 --> 01:58:16.558]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:58:16.578 --> 01:58:21.220]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:22.521]  The Security Pack includes...
[01:58:27.023 --> 01:58:29.765]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:32.828 --> 01:58:37.232]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:54.827 --> 01:59:00.789]  All right, my friends, we've got Tito Howard, the documentary filmmaker, investigative journalist, Ph.D.
[01:59:01.089 --> 01:59:03.910]  in modern military affairs and history.
[01:59:05.150 --> 01:59:14.032]  And later this week, we're going to have Captain Boston, who was involved with the cover-up under orders from LBJ and others, coming on.
[01:59:14.052 --> 01:59:18.593]  We're going to line up some admirals and hopefully some of the survivors that we've had on in years past.
[01:59:18.654 --> 01:59:24.035]  Now it's broken big news because such big guns in government are telling the truth about it.
[01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:32.466]  And again, Tito Howard, kicking off this investigative report, because we're going to do several of these this week, is joining us.
[01:59:32.486 --> 01:59:37.250]  We've got loaded phone lines, a lot of patient listeners.
[01:59:37.591 --> 01:59:47.339]  1967, during the Six-Day War, June 8, 1967, over a dozen Israeli fighter bombers, six attack torpedo boats...
[01:59:48.329 --> 01:59:51.110]  Attack the ship, but by the grace of God, it didn't sink.
[01:59:51.190 --> 01:59:56.632]  Most highly decorated, highest number of casualties in U.S.
[01:59:56.672 --> 01:59:58.813]  history for any one ship in one attack.
[01:59:59.313 --> 02:00:01.794]  The captain was given the Congressional Medal of Honor in secret.
[02:00:02.685 --> 02:00:04.005]  And now the cover-up's coming out.
[02:00:04.045 --> 02:00:06.326]  But the bigger cover-up is that the U.S.
[02:00:06.366 --> 02:00:14.028]  government controlled that ship, meant to sink it, to blame it on Egypt, and I've talked to the survivors, Tito Howard, the admirals on the show.
[02:00:14.188 --> 02:00:16.069]  I've been talking about this for four or five years, I guess.
[02:00:16.869 --> 02:00:21.531]  They agree this is part of the New World Order takeover system, basically government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:00:22.291 --> 02:00:23.191]  It's the same M.O.
[02:00:23.291 --> 02:00:24.051]  over and over again.
[02:00:24.111 --> 02:00:25.772]  Tito, you ready to go to some of these calls?
[02:00:27.845 --> 02:00:28.085]  Great.
[02:00:28.145 --> 02:00:28.686]  Let's do it.
[02:00:28.746 --> 02:00:30.667]  Let's talk to Darren in Colorado.
[02:00:30.887 --> 02:00:31.748]  Darren, you're on the air.
[02:00:31.788 --> 02:00:32.249]  Go ahead.
[02:00:32.549 --> 02:00:33.009]  Thank you, sir.
[02:00:33.309 --> 02:00:33.630]  You bet.
[02:00:34.170 --> 02:00:38.353]  I'd like to wish you both a wonderful day, and it's a privilege to be here with you.
[02:00:38.553 --> 02:00:45.139]  I am usually in lockstep with the views you espouse, Alex, but I've got to take issue with this one.
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:56.928]  My rudimentary knowledge of the attack on the USS Liberty is that it was our highest technologically advanced surveillance ship of the day.
[02:00:57.768 --> 02:01:08.893]  And what they were doing were monitoring the Israeli Army's communications, and they were beaming those to the Arab assailants against Israel.
[02:01:09.133 --> 02:01:10.213]  That's just not true.
[02:01:10.674 --> 02:01:12.274]  That's just not true.
[02:01:12.334 --> 02:01:16.276]  The Liberty was there to monitor everything in the Middle East.
[02:01:16.296 --> 02:01:20.958]  We were not taking sides in the conflict, certainly not openly.
[02:01:21.118 --> 02:01:21.638]  There is strong...
[02:01:24.111 --> 02:01:29.835]  Feelings that there are people inside our government that help set the liberty up, as Alex had mentioned.
[02:01:29.875 --> 02:01:35.559]  But this argument has been used a lot to denigrate the argument of this brave crew.
[02:01:35.639 --> 02:01:37.420]  Well, let me ask the caller a question.
[02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:39.441]  Tito, let me ask the caller a question.
[02:01:39.801 --> 02:01:44.264]  So is it good that they didn't allow the planes to go defend it?
[02:01:44.304 --> 02:01:49.267]  Is it good they strafed the lifeboats in the water because they were, quote, helping the Arabs?
[02:01:52.501 --> 02:01:54.905]  My understanding... So now Americans come second.
[02:01:54.925 --> 02:01:55.466]  Okay, I got you.
[02:01:55.546 --> 02:02:01.595]  My understanding is that the Israelis' hand was forced because they needed...
[02:02:03.374 --> 02:02:04.995]  Why?
[02:02:07.296 --> 02:02:15.281]  That's why you shoot it with a torpedo and blow a 42-foot hole in it and have thousands of cannon holes?
[02:02:15.521 --> 02:02:17.603]  And a two-hour and 15-minute attack.
[02:02:18.043 --> 02:02:22.566]  And then I guess strafing the lifeboats is to stop them from using a ham radio to warn the Arabs.
[02:02:22.746 --> 02:02:30.731]  I mean, even this heartstring-tugging rehashment of all the survivors, just the fact that there are all these survivors...
[02:02:33.692 --> 02:02:39.755]  70% casualties, man.
[02:02:39.835 --> 02:02:50.621]  And we never... I think it's important for this gentleman to understand that on the 8th of June, all the fighting was done.
[02:02:50.641 --> 02:02:54.302]  The Israelis had won the war actually by the evening of the 6th.
[02:02:55.163 --> 02:02:59.525]  And they had... They realized that if you took all of the Arabs
[02:03:00.211 --> 02:03:03.194]  Military from Morocco to Kuwait.
[02:03:03.234 --> 02:03:05.776]  At that point in history, they could defeat them.
[02:03:05.896 --> 02:03:08.759]  But they did not yet have the Golan Heights.
[02:03:08.919 --> 02:03:09.400]  Got a break.
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:10.120]  I'll tell you what.
[02:03:10.161 --> 02:03:11.622]  Stay there, Darren, okay?
[02:03:12.683 --> 02:03:13.243]  Are you there, buddy?
[02:03:13.263 --> 02:03:16.386]  Okay, Darren, don't hang up.
[02:03:16.507 --> 02:03:17.808]  I want to talk to you on the other side.
[02:03:19.169 --> 02:03:24.074]  I mean, you talk about psychological gymnastics to make excuses for this.
[02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:28.711]  But I guess you're not saying that the Liberty wasn't intentionally attacked.
[02:03:28.751 --> 02:03:31.252]  Now it's because their hands were tied.
[02:03:33.834 --> 02:03:36.776]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:03:37.436 --> 02:03:38.737]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:03:38.937 --> 02:03:44.681]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:03:44.961 --> 02:03:50.224]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:50.504 --> 02:03:54.607]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:03:54.787 --> 02:03:58.611]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:58.851 --> 02:04:03.515]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:04:03.575 --> 02:04:09.861]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:04:09.901 --> 02:04:11.723]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:04:12.203 --> 02:04:14.285]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyrion today.
[02:04:14.365 --> 02:04:16.946]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:04:17.086 --> 02:04:20.749]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:04:21.509 --> 02:04:25.892]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[02:04:26.012 --> 02:04:27.993]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[02:04:28.233 --> 02:04:29.754]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:04:29.935 --> 02:04:31.976]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:04:32.931 --> 02:04:34.592]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:04:34.612 --> 02:04:37.114]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:05:01.031 --> 02:05:05.835]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[02:05:21.906 --> 02:05:23.027]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:05:32.546 --> 02:05:33.007]  We're good to go.
[02:05:52.709 --> 02:05:57.550]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[02:05:58.010 --> 02:06:02.691]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises for one of the most affordable ozone generators available today.
[02:06:03.111 --> 02:06:04.531]  That number is 800-569-4340.
[02:06:06.331 --> 02:06:15.433]  The ozone generator is portable, has an internal blower for ozone disbursement into the air, and comes with a tube attachment for ozonating liquids.
[02:06:15.833 --> 02:06:17.193]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[02:06:17.553 --> 02:06:18.894]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.
[02:06:21.494 --> 02:06:21.734]  Big Brother.
[02:06:21.774 --> 02:06:22.315]  Mainstream Media.
[02:06:40.644 --> 02:06:41.745]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:42.386 --> 02:06:43.206]  You want answers?
[02:06:43.987 --> 02:06:44.887]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:44.907 --> 02:06:49.211]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:49.731 --> 02:06:53.834]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:55.476 --> 02:06:59.599]  All right, later this week, we have a bunch of the survivors of the USS Liberty.
[02:07:00.019 --> 02:07:04.823]  We have some of the officers involved in the cover-up under Johnson's orders who talked to him.
[02:07:07.086 --> 02:07:12.950]  And all these years, we have the filmmaker, Tito Howard, been researching this for years, on with us, loss of liberty filmmaker.
[02:07:12.970 --> 02:07:13.690]  We've got loaded phones.
[02:07:13.710 --> 02:07:14.771]  We're about to go back to your calls.
[02:07:15.852 --> 02:07:17.693]  All these years, oh, no, Israel didn't know.
[02:07:17.713 --> 02:07:18.233]  It was a mistake.
[02:07:18.493 --> 02:07:20.095]  It's a conspiracy theory to say that.
[02:07:20.155 --> 02:07:23.797]  Now the people involved in the cover-up have gone forward with incredible honor.
[02:07:24.677 --> 02:07:33.303]  And so this caller, Darren, says, well, the Israelis had their hand forced as the war was ending to go ahead and try to sink this ship.
[02:07:33.523 --> 02:07:34.544]  No, they didn't try to sink it.
[02:07:34.564 --> 02:07:36.125]  I guess that's why they strafed the lifeboats.
[02:07:37.146 --> 02:07:48.331]  I mean, I have no... The psychological gymnastics of rationalizing this, it's like rationalizing Bill Clinton bombing Oklahoma City or the connections with the U.S.
[02:07:48.351 --> 02:07:49.391]  government and Al-Qaeda.
[02:07:49.911 --> 02:07:54.293]  I mean, we've had Israeli writers on to talk about the Israeli government killing Yitzhak Rabin.
[02:07:54.333 --> 02:07:57.555]  I guess, you know, I mean, can Israel do something wrong?
[02:07:57.575 --> 02:07:59.315]  You know, I focus mainly on the U.S.
[02:07:59.355 --> 02:08:03.837]  government using Israel to do this to expand the war into Egypt, which they wanted to do.
[02:08:04.117 --> 02:08:05.198]  That's what the evidence shows.
[02:08:05.738 --> 02:08:19.843]  But Darren, to have you here defending this atrocity and saying, oh, that's why there wasn't that many casualties, when it's record casualties, and talking about heartstrings here, and the Admiral threatening the sailors on board the ship, keep your mouth shut or you're going to prison.
[02:08:20.903 --> 02:08:22.564]  Go ahead, defend yourself, Darren.
[02:08:22.584 --> 02:08:23.904]  I'm amazed by your statements.
[02:08:27.577 --> 02:08:30.619]  Well, we may have lost Darren, but let me just say this.
[02:08:30.639 --> 02:08:31.080]  Well, hold on.
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:31.980]  Is Darren not there?
[02:08:32.361 --> 02:08:32.901]  I'm right here.
[02:08:33.241 --> 02:08:33.902]  Go ahead, Darren.
[02:08:33.942 --> 02:08:34.222]  Talk.
[02:08:34.402 --> 02:08:37.044]  The Jews, when you do the math, should have lost that war.
[02:08:37.545 --> 02:08:44.230]  They did everything they had to do to win, and even to this day, it's a miracle they overcame the numbers they were up against.
[02:08:44.410 --> 02:08:47.953]  So LBJ is saying, I don't care if they all die, so what?
[02:08:47.993 --> 02:08:48.873]  That's a good thing?
[02:08:49.234 --> 02:08:51.575]  They needed to do what they had to do.
[02:08:51.996 --> 02:08:53.517]  There was no military...
[02:08:54.231 --> 02:08:58.675]  Wait a minute, I thought it was an accident.
[02:08:58.695 --> 02:08:59.475]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:08:59.535 --> 02:09:01.016]  Israel always said it was an accident.
[02:09:01.197 --> 02:09:02.538]  Are you saying they're lying?
[02:09:03.218 --> 02:09:08.042]  I'm saying that both governments sought to let this thing stay underneath a rug.
[02:09:08.222 --> 02:09:10.104]  Well, why didn't they just pull the ship out?
[02:09:10.164 --> 02:09:11.004]  That's ridiculous.
[02:09:11.284 --> 02:09:13.366]  The White House knew it was Israel attacking it.
[02:09:13.406 --> 02:09:14.907]  Why didn't they just call the ship out of there?
[02:09:15.087 --> 02:09:15.848]  That's the president.
[02:09:15.988 --> 02:09:18.270]  They wanted to sink that ship to blame it on Egypt.
[02:09:19.013 --> 02:09:20.674]  The Americans were helping the Arabs.
[02:09:20.854 --> 02:09:22.074]  That's what that ship was doing.
[02:09:22.094 --> 02:09:22.694]  No, that's not true.
[02:09:22.814 --> 02:09:23.675]  I've talked to people.
[02:09:23.715 --> 02:09:26.076]  We were shipping the Israelis all the weapons.
[02:09:26.296 --> 02:09:27.256]  That's insane!
[02:09:27.276 --> 02:09:30.617]  Well, we weren't sending that many weapons at that time.
[02:09:30.657 --> 02:09:32.538]  They're mostly dependent on French weapons.
[02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:39.060]  But it is very true that we knew that there would be an Israeli victory.
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:40.281]  It wasn't a surprise.
[02:09:40.781 --> 02:09:44.382]  And they wiped out 80% of the Egyptian Air Force on the ground.
[02:09:44.842 --> 02:09:47.203]  The same numbers that we lost that Pearl...
[02:09:47.745 --> 02:09:49.805]  I am by no means a scholar on this subject.
[02:09:49.825 --> 02:09:53.946]  The truth is that that was premeditated and deliberate, and I came upon this very honestly...
[02:10:15.069 --> 02:10:28.558]  Because I was told that by Admiral Thomas Moore in 1975, that it was a premeditated and deliberate attack, and that it was five months after he stepped down from being chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:10:28.698 --> 02:10:31.219]  Darrell, have you seen the film?
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:33.321]  What film?
[02:10:33.861 --> 02:10:35.242]  My film, A Loss of Liberty.
[02:10:35.322 --> 02:10:36.082]  No, sir, I have not.
[02:10:36.162 --> 02:10:39.705]  Well, you should order a copy of the film and then present the argument.
[02:10:40.165 --> 02:10:41.666]  I've got Arlie Burke in there.
[02:10:41.686 --> 02:10:43.347]  Remember the USS Cole movie?
[02:10:43.922 --> 02:10:44.382]  Yes, sir, I do.
[02:10:44.422 --> 02:10:44.663]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:02.937 --> 02:11:05.958]  Let me ask this question.
[02:11:06.018 --> 02:11:07.098]  Tito, let me ask this question.
[02:11:07.298 --> 02:11:12.739]  Because it's admitted that the Israelis scraped with the gunboats the life rafts.
[02:11:12.799 --> 02:11:13.599]  Why'd they do that?
[02:11:13.779 --> 02:11:15.559]  No, the gunboats did, not the airplanes.
[02:11:15.659 --> 02:11:16.859]  I mean, they said gunboats.
[02:11:16.919 --> 02:11:17.620]  Yes, yes.
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:18.000]  Why?
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:20.780]  Well, because they didn't want any survivors.
[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:31.322]  That's why later on there were two large Israeli helicopters, and one of the crew members took a photo of one of them, and I had the thing blown up, and that's when we discovered...
[02:11:31.923 --> 02:11:32.583]  Why did they turn back?
[02:11:32.603 --> 02:11:36.284]  Because they picked up that American forces were finally on the way.
[02:11:36.304 --> 02:11:37.264]  It wasn't true, but it worked.
[02:11:37.284 --> 02:11:39.645]  It's an absolute miracle that that ship survived.
[02:11:39.785 --> 02:11:41.665]  And the problem in the Middle East...
[02:12:01.221 --> 02:12:10.125]  As far as the American people is concerned, is that there is absolutely no causal relationship, no cause and effect for the things that Israel does.
[02:12:11.366 --> 02:12:22.171]  We just passed the 20th anniversary of 243 Marines, later 268 total, some dying from wounds, in Beirut, Lebanon.
[02:12:22.191 --> 02:12:28.313]  Our Marines would not have even been there if the Israelis had not lied to our government, saying they were going to go 20 kilometers away
[02:12:32.591 --> 02:12:38.574]  Okay, let's not... I don't want to divert off into other subjects.
[02:12:38.634 --> 02:12:41.035]  We know... Yeah, but it's the same thing... Let me just stop you.
[02:12:41.055 --> 02:12:42.055]  We've got a bunch of calls to you.
[02:12:42.095 --> 02:12:43.096]  I really appreciate you.
[02:12:43.696 --> 02:12:45.597]  Darren, any final comments?
[02:12:47.118 --> 02:12:54.621]  When I first sought to educate myself on this subject, I listened to talk radio and I called a couple prominent radio talk shows and...
[02:12:55.222 --> 02:12:55.462]  John who?
[02:13:11.728 --> 02:13:19.315]  Well, sir, all we're doing is going off the admirals and the captain of the ship and the witnesses and what's admitted.
[02:13:19.455 --> 02:13:20.416]  And I appreciate the call.
[02:13:20.436 --> 02:13:21.477]  We've got to go to other callers.
[02:13:21.497 --> 02:13:23.298]  You need to get informed, sir.
[02:13:23.779 --> 02:13:24.539]  Order of the film.
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:26.341]  Look, I'll criticize Germany.
[02:13:26.401 --> 02:13:27.362]  I'll criticize England.
[02:13:27.382 --> 02:13:28.223]  I'll criticize the U.S.
[02:13:28.263 --> 02:13:28.603]  government.
[02:13:28.883 --> 02:13:29.884]  I'll criticize Israel.
[02:13:29.964 --> 02:13:32.566]  I'll criticize anybody that does something wrong.
[02:13:32.686 --> 02:13:34.308]  I stand up against evil activities.
[02:13:34.808 --> 02:13:37.409]  And this was evil, leaving our men out there to die.
[02:13:37.769 --> 02:13:43.971]  And the real culprits here, even bigger than Israel, is LBJ and that Turkey McNamara and all the rest of them.
[02:13:43.991 --> 02:13:46.172]  Now, let's go to Mike in Arizona.
[02:13:46.472 --> 02:13:47.232]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:13:47.252 --> 02:13:47.672]  Go ahead.
[02:13:48.153 --> 02:13:49.233]  Yeah, hi, Mr. Howard, Alex.
[02:13:50.713 --> 02:13:56.315]  You know, I was just amazed listening to the former apologist for Israel.
[02:13:56.936 --> 02:13:58.136]  But, you know, sadly...
[02:13:58.737 --> 02:14:04.722]  I think much of what he was saying comes right out of the pulpit of many of the evangelical churches in this country.
[02:14:06.764 --> 02:14:17.413]  This Israel worship is what it amounts to that says that we must bless Israel by turning a blind eye to every crime they commit.
[02:14:18.013 --> 02:14:21.436]  And I don't think that's what the Bible teaches, and I know it doesn't teach that.
[02:14:23.005 --> 02:14:27.646]  Well, I mean, that's what Jesus was doing when he was there criticizing the corruption of the establishment.
[02:14:27.666 --> 02:14:29.006]  I mean, all these governments.
[02:14:29.026 --> 02:14:32.367]  The Bible says the devil has the whole world in his sway.
[02:14:32.387 --> 02:14:35.548]  I mean, let's go off the Bible.
[02:14:35.588 --> 02:14:39.009]  If the Antichrist is going to go take over Israel, we're going to be told to worship the Antichrist?
[02:14:39.349 --> 02:14:48.030]  I mean, this is ridiculous, but my whole point here is we have the facts of the USS Liberty, and people are still in denial about government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:14:48.250 --> 02:14:50.511]  Yeah, for him to suggest that,
[02:14:50.902 --> 02:14:52.503]  Well, look at how many survivors there were.
[02:14:53.743 --> 02:14:56.224]  Only two-thirds of them had injuries or were killed.
[02:14:56.905 --> 02:15:01.487]  It's like saying, look at all the Jewish survivors from World War II.
[02:15:01.807 --> 02:15:05.128]  Well, there couldn't have been any atrocities committed against the Jews.
[02:15:05.588 --> 02:15:07.449]  No, it's just as callous as that is.
[02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:11.291]  But let me ask you, there are a couple of serious questions I had.
[02:15:11.431 --> 02:15:16.913]  At what stage of the Arab-Israeli war was the attack on the liberty?
[02:15:16.973 --> 02:15:18.494]  Was it toward the beginning of the war?
[02:15:18.514 --> 02:15:20.355]  Oh, no, the beginning of the war...
[02:15:21.039 --> 02:15:23.701]  It was the wee hours of June the 5th.
[02:15:23.741 --> 02:15:26.183]  The Israelis attacked in force.
[02:15:26.323 --> 02:15:34.308]  The Egyptians had been told earlier that day that there would not be a war, so they were sort of relaxed, and the Israelis knew it.
[02:15:34.788 --> 02:15:42.934]  The Israelis claimed that the Israelis had moved armor and infantry out of the Sinai into the Negev Desert.
[02:15:42.954 --> 02:15:48.037]  It was a lie, and nobody's challenged that except some in the UN, but certainly not in our government.
[02:15:48.607 --> 02:15:54.812]  So they, under the guise of that excuse, wiped out 80% of the Egyptian Air Force.
[02:15:55.613 --> 02:15:57.835]  At that point, the war was really over.
[02:15:57.915 --> 02:15:59.656]  There's some clean-up stuff.
[02:16:00.156 --> 02:16:08.143]  If you remember, the genesis of the 1967 war had to do with the closing of the Gulf of Aqaba through the Straits of Turan near Sharm el-Sheikh.
[02:16:09.084 --> 02:16:13.988]  And U Thant, who was then the UN guy, he...
[02:16:15.066 --> 02:16:17.588]  I ordered under Nasser's thing.
[02:16:17.648 --> 02:16:21.491]  Nasser wanted to pull back, I think it was 20 kilometers or whatever it was.
[02:16:21.651 --> 02:16:24.493]  And we told him, no, just take them out of Sinai.
[02:16:24.593 --> 02:16:25.773]  And that laid the groundwork.
[02:16:25.833 --> 02:16:30.176]  So we did not have very clean hands in that.
[02:16:30.317 --> 02:16:42.605]  And one has to remember that six years later, we were helping Israel so much that the Arabs made an oil embargo against us and Western Europe and everybody else.
[02:16:43.268 --> 02:16:47.930]  And it destroyed literally thousands of American companies.
[02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:48.991]  Okay, we've got to move on.
[02:16:49.011 --> 02:16:50.932]  Anything else there, Mike?
[02:16:51.092 --> 02:16:57.495]  Yeah, Alex, by the way, our policy changed dramatically when Kennedy was assassinated and Johnson took over.
[02:16:57.935 --> 02:16:58.675]  Absolutely.
[02:16:58.715 --> 02:17:00.236]  Suddenly this big figure opened up wide.
[02:17:00.276 --> 02:17:01.136]  From white to black.
[02:17:01.636 --> 02:17:07.019]  Did Israel ever fly combat missions against any of the Arab states without identification markings?
[02:17:07.219 --> 02:17:09.320]  Never that I know of, except in this case.
[02:17:10.089 --> 02:17:11.170]  Just this case.
[02:17:11.570 --> 02:17:12.791]  That's my understanding.
[02:17:12.811 --> 02:17:21.017]  And the Joint Chiefs of Staff had taken specific control of that ship weeks before this happened and had it parked out there under their control.
[02:17:21.097 --> 02:17:21.798]  Correct, Tito?
[02:17:22.118 --> 02:17:22.818]  That's correct.
[02:17:23.199 --> 02:17:31.044]  And there were three messages that were sent by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Liberty.
[02:17:31.144 --> 02:17:36.889]  And this is part of what Alex was referring to earlier, the setup of the Liberty.
[02:17:36.969 --> 02:17:37.309]  Because
[02:17:37.875 --> 02:17:38.556]  We're good to go.
[02:17:58.755 --> 02:18:01.318]  Navy base at that time in the Philippines.
[02:18:01.438 --> 02:18:03.560]  None of them reached the Liberty until after the attack.
[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:04.461]  That's outrageous.
[02:18:04.561 --> 02:18:05.242]  We got a break.
[02:18:05.722 --> 02:18:06.823]  It's obvious, folks.
[02:18:07.103 --> 02:18:08.445]  Again, get past Israel.
[02:18:08.485 --> 02:18:09.726]  Get past all this stuff.
[02:18:10.347 --> 02:18:14.010]  The United States government was doing this and controlling this.
[02:18:14.691 --> 02:18:16.413]  Do you understand that?
[02:18:17.122 --> 02:18:20.525]  To blame it on Egypt to expand the war.
[02:18:21.065 --> 02:18:24.628]  The Northwoods Plan being activated.
[02:18:24.688 --> 02:18:30.013]  That's exactly what the Northwoods Plan calls for, sinking a ship and blaming it on someone.
[02:18:30.553 --> 02:18:31.654]  We'll be back with more calls.
[02:18:33.163 --> 02:18:36.624]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:18:36.905 --> 02:18:40.406]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:18:40.486 --> 02:18:44.428]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:18:44.668 --> 02:18:50.810]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:51.231 --> 02:18:59.134]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:18:59.554 --> 02:19:04.896]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:19:05.056 --> 02:19:08.797]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:09.177 --> 02:19:11.037]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:19:11.097 --> 02:19:13.258]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:19:13.498 --> 02:19:18.440]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[02:20:32.085 --> 02:20:34.286]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:20:34.726 --> 02:20:39.089]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:45.152]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:20:45.392 --> 02:20:49.454]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:20:49.735 --> 02:20:55.378]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[02:20:55.498 --> 02:20:58.099]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:03.722]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:21:03.842 --> 02:21:06.524]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:21:06.864 --> 02:21:09.165]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:21:09.546 --> 02:21:13.188]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:21:13.648 --> 02:21:19.852]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:21:20.292 --> 02:21:21.273]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:21:21.293 --> 02:21:22.053]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:22.093 --> 02:21:22.333]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:31.730 --> 02:21:32.110]  We're good to go.
[02:21:47.797 --> 02:21:48.358]  We're good to go.
[02:22:05.074 --> 02:22:07.995]  4327 extension 106 for quotes or more information.
[02:22:08.275 --> 02:22:12.577]  That number again is 877-996-4327 extension 106.
[02:22:13.317 --> 02:22:14.498]  Everyone listens to radio.
[02:22:14.798 --> 02:22:17.299]  It's the most cost-effective way to increase business available.
[02:22:17.619 --> 02:22:19.560]  Don't wait around hoping for a stronger economy.
[02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:22.841]  The country might be slipping into recession, but your business doesn't have to.
[02:22:23.221 --> 02:22:25.602]  Call GCN today and get more customers tomorrow.
[02:22:42.056 --> 02:22:43.597]  Folks, evil is evil.
[02:22:44.578 --> 02:22:47.801]  And government-sponsored terror is the norm, not the exception.
[02:22:48.422 --> 02:22:53.647]  And the evidence is crystal clear and hardcore that the Israeli and U.S.
[02:22:53.687 --> 02:22:57.611]  governments were trying to sink that ship to blame it on Egypt.
[02:22:58.972 --> 02:23:05.495]  And, I mean, it just shows, frankly, the delusional nature with that caller Darren earlier.
[02:23:05.895 --> 02:23:06.715]  Darren, I'm not your enemy.
[02:23:06.775 --> 02:23:15.178]  I mean, you sounded like a nice guy, you know, saying, well, you know, they just wanted to break the antennas and shows the low level of casualties.
[02:23:15.238 --> 02:23:17.359]  It's record casualties for a single ship.
[02:23:18.139 --> 02:23:22.201]  I mean, it just, everything you said goes against the facts here.
[02:23:23.081 --> 02:23:24.582]  We're talking to Tito Howard, filmmaker.
[02:23:24.602 --> 02:23:27.063]  We're going to have some of the survivors on later this week with Tito.
[02:23:27.543 --> 02:23:29.164]  Elizabeth and Marilyn, you're on the air.
[02:23:29.224 --> 02:23:29.664]  Go ahead.
[02:23:30.165 --> 02:23:30.945]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:23:31.085 --> 02:23:38.009]  This is really four-star radio investigative journalism, and I'm very grateful to you and Tito Howard.
[02:23:38.369 --> 02:23:40.250]  I look forward to the continuing series.
[02:23:40.610 --> 02:23:48.654]  If you recall, about three weeks ago, I phoned you that I was going to start a radio show on 840 WKDI in Annapolis.
[02:23:49.048 --> 02:23:51.950]  And it's on Fridays for a half hour after your show.
[02:23:52.170 --> 02:23:54.192]  One of our great affiliates, God bless him.
[02:23:54.212 --> 02:23:54.632]  Go ahead.
[02:23:54.732 --> 02:24:11.345]  Yes, and I think that you've inspired me quite a bit that this is the same wheel of evil that you've described there in the way you said that the precedents were set for the future provocateur and terrorism incidents, like the Northwoods Plan.
[02:24:11.585 --> 02:24:14.507]  And I think it's almost like a perfect closure today, Alex.
[02:24:14.847 --> 02:24:15.748]  Here's the U.S.
[02:24:15.808 --> 02:24:17.850]  Liberty, and I'm going to...
[02:24:18.852 --> 02:24:27.634]  On Veterans Day, I'm going to ask people to write to Ron Paul and the Liberty Committee and to all other legislators and fax them and telephone them.
[02:24:28.074 --> 02:24:37.296]  And the reason is, the latest understandings that I have on the Universal National Service Act, not just the draft, and the bill is H.R.
[02:24:37.397 --> 02:24:37.817]  163 in the House,
[02:24:39.938 --> 02:24:41.659]  And in the Senate, it is 89.
[02:24:41.799 --> 02:24:44.240]  That's 163 HR and Senate 89.
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:45.501]  Now, that's accurate.
[02:24:45.521 --> 02:24:46.882]  I have that in Police State 3.
[02:24:47.342 --> 02:24:52.485]  Universal draft for everybody, 18 to 49, for domestic service corps.
[02:24:52.785 --> 02:24:54.546]  Tito Howard, comments to what she's saying.
[02:24:55.326 --> 02:24:58.508]  Well, I'm very interested in what the lady said.
[02:24:59.208 --> 02:25:06.512]  And the only chance to get the truth out against a very powerful...
[02:25:07.216 --> 02:25:13.441]  We had a breakthrough meeting on Capitol Hill, followed by another meeting at an important group, the Exchange Club in the U.S.
[02:25:13.461 --> 02:25:13.722]  Senate.
[02:25:13.762 --> 02:25:17.044]  The mainstream newspapers have not picked it up.
[02:25:17.064 --> 02:25:17.685]  There should be a
[02:25:35.782 --> 02:25:47.096]  There should be op-ed pieces, there should be debates, there should be all this stuff, but we are so committed to the interests of Israel
[02:25:48.163 --> 02:25:52.765]  We tend not to pay much attention to our own interests and what the tremendous cost is.
[02:25:52.865 --> 02:25:58.848]  On Veterans Day, we've got witnesses, high-level officers, saying Johnson said, I don't care if they all die.
[02:25:58.868 --> 02:26:00.289]  That's wrong, folks.
[02:26:00.429 --> 02:26:00.729]  U.S.
[02:26:00.789 --> 02:26:02.449]  troops come first.
[02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:05.511]  And again, this is our own government carrying out Northwoods.
[02:26:05.551 --> 02:26:06.831]  Thanks for the call, Elizabeth.
[02:26:06.851 --> 02:26:07.912]  Could I add one more thing?
[02:26:08.012 --> 02:26:08.953]  Real quick, there's other calls.
[02:26:08.973 --> 02:26:09.753]  All right, great.
[02:26:09.913 --> 02:26:23.382]  I think the rubber is meeting the road, that if we don't complain now, we are not going to have our liberties, because the only reason we won't have any armed forces, it'll be to maintain internal order here as part of the U.N.
[02:26:23.482 --> 02:26:24.122]  Peace Force.
[02:26:24.202 --> 02:26:24.563]  That's it.
[02:26:24.603 --> 02:26:25.363]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:26.104 --> 02:26:27.344]  And notice the symbology.
[02:26:27.745 --> 02:26:29.966]  The USS Liberty attacked...
[02:26:30.635 --> 02:26:36.536]  And today we see government-sponsored terror being used as a way to attack our real liberties.
[02:26:37.216 --> 02:26:38.177]  It's out of control.
[02:26:38.197 --> 02:26:42.778]  Alex, that's why I named the film The Loss of Liberty, because it means both.
[02:26:44.558 --> 02:26:47.478]  We're going to plug after this break real quick how to get the video again.
[02:26:47.779 --> 02:26:49.719]  Peter in Florida, you're on the air, and then Roger.
[02:26:49.739 --> 02:26:50.399]  That's it for calls.
[02:26:50.419 --> 02:26:50.979]  Go ahead, Peter.
[02:26:51.439 --> 02:26:52.019]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[02:26:52.059 --> 02:26:53.800]  I've got a question for Howard.
[02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:59.681]  On the 15 hours after the attack that none of our fleet out there went to help him or rescue him,
[02:27:00.290 --> 02:27:05.233]  I believe there was one Russian ship that pulled up and asked if they wanted assistance, and they said no.
[02:27:05.253 --> 02:27:06.374]  That's correct.
[02:27:07.094 --> 02:27:11.277]  Was there any radio communication going on during that 15 hours, like calling for help?
[02:27:11.317 --> 02:27:17.861]  Well, there was communication after the attack was finally called off at about 4.27.
[02:27:18.581 --> 02:27:24.805]  So it was a two-hour and 15-minute attack.
[02:27:24.965 --> 02:27:28.327]  And, of course, those Russians wanted that secret transmission system.
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:36.263]  Yeah, and Russian trawlers also track the Liberty all the way, come off the open to get some papers or stuff, float by them.
[02:27:36.703 --> 02:27:41.745]  Maybe a status report on the condition of the ship so they would know how to play it out later or something.
[02:27:42.905 --> 02:27:48.528]  On May 14th, a bunch of admirals went down to Washington, D.C.
[02:27:48.548 --> 02:27:54.050]  for a news conference to try to address the Congress, to put the pressure on.
[02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:55.630]  Do you remember that?
[02:27:55.650 --> 02:27:56.891]  May 14th?
[02:27:58.228 --> 02:27:59.950]  Yeah, May 14th of last year, I think.
[02:28:01.211 --> 02:28:02.832]  Oh, no, I know what that was.
[02:28:02.912 --> 02:28:11.940]  No, that was our announcement that the film was done in the formulation of the Liberty Alliance with Moore as the chairman.
[02:28:11.980 --> 02:28:16.103]  That was done in the Army-Navy Club, and well attended.
[02:28:16.143 --> 02:28:21.728]  We've got to break again, do a few more minutes with Tito, take a final call from Roger, and I'm going to shift gears.
[02:28:23.489 --> 02:28:24.410]  We're on the march.
[02:28:24.890 --> 02:28:26.392]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:28:27.414 --> 02:28:30.100]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:33.192 --> 02:28:36.694]  I have been on collagenate for three months now and I've lost 40 pounds.
[02:28:37.195 --> 02:28:38.655]  40 pounds in three months?
[02:28:39.116 --> 02:28:44.659]  Ann's another listener who took my advice and lost weight the safe and healthy way with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:28:44.939 --> 02:28:47.161]  I heard about collagenate through radio station.
[02:28:47.521 --> 02:28:49.562]  I've gone down about three dress sizes.
[02:28:49.762 --> 02:28:50.262]  I feel good.
[02:28:50.282 --> 02:28:50.923]  I have energy.
[02:28:51.103 --> 02:28:52.164]  I was really tired before.
[02:28:52.184 --> 02:28:55.085]  I didn't have a lot of energy and I've got three kids, so it was kind of hard to keep up with them.
[02:28:55.245 --> 02:28:56.306]  But now I feel wonderful.
[02:28:56.486 --> 02:28:57.887]  I've had people notice quite a bit.
[02:28:57.927 --> 02:28:59.668]  They're coming up to me and they're saying, what have you done?
[02:28:59.728 --> 02:29:01.009]  And I went on collagenate.
[02:29:01.571 --> 02:29:05.054]  I have been on collagenate for three months now and I've lost 40 pounds.
[02:29:05.314 --> 02:29:06.935]  Wow, 40 pounds!
[02:29:07.315 --> 02:29:11.118]  This was Ann's personal experience while taking Vim and Vigor's collagenate.
[02:29:11.298 --> 02:29:13.620]  Why don't you see what collagenate can do for you?
[02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:15.381]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:29:15.401 --> 02:29:15.721]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:29:19.964 --> 02:29:34.616]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[02:29:34.856 --> 02:29:41.181]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[02:29:41.481 --> 02:29:47.286]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them but still have them safe and sound?
[02:29:47.796 --> 02:29:48.276]  We're good to go.
[02:30:17.732 --> 02:30:25.435]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the Internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:30:25.695 --> 02:30:30.137]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:30:32.017 --> 02:30:35.920]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:41.585]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:30:41.865 --> 02:30:52.233]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:30:52.393 --> 02:30:56.737]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:30:57.177 --> 02:31:05.363]  And volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:31:05.543 --> 02:31:11.908]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:31:12.028 --> 02:31:16.511]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:31:16.731 --> 02:31:20.934]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:31:21.315 --> 02:31:25.558]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888
[02:31:26.318 --> 02:31:27.519]  888-803-4438.
[02:31:27.579 --> 02:31:30.402]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:31:34.125 --> 02:31:36.907]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:31:37.448 --> 02:31:40.791]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:43.513 --> 02:31:45.274]  Coming up, U.S.
[02:31:45.314 --> 02:31:47.656]  blocks payout to Gulf War veterans.
[02:31:47.917 --> 02:31:50.119]  Bush administration has blocked compensation for U.S.
[02:31:50.159 --> 02:31:52.701]  soldiers captured and tortured during the first Cold War.
[02:31:53.619 --> 02:31:56.740]  Arguing the money is now needed for Iraq's reconstruction.
[02:31:58.241 --> 02:31:59.361]  That's from London Guardian.
[02:32:00.141 --> 02:32:02.122]  Also, mystery illness causing major U.S.
[02:32:02.162 --> 02:32:02.982]  troop casualties.
[02:32:03.222 --> 02:32:05.703]  Army orders Mother of Seven back to duty in Iraq.
[02:32:07.264 --> 02:32:10.365]  Not enough troops for Veterans Day parades today.
[02:32:11.845 --> 02:32:14.046]  Also, martial law to be declared in London.
[02:32:14.266 --> 02:32:15.666]  No one's allowed to protest.
[02:32:16.106 --> 02:32:17.567]  Lord Bush when he comes to town.
[02:32:18.422 --> 02:32:19.102]  We're good to go.
[02:32:19.122 --> 02:32:19.563]  We're good to go.
[02:32:19.583 --> 02:32:20.323]  We're good to go.
[02:32:34.759 --> 02:32:36.740]  I appreciate Tito Howard coming on.
[02:32:36.981 --> 02:32:38.061]  It's been an interesting show.
[02:32:38.081 --> 02:32:46.287]  We're going to have him back up with some of the officers involved in the whitewash that have now gone public because of their conscience and some of the survivors later this week, Thursday or Friday.
[02:32:46.307 --> 02:32:48.108]  We should have another two hours on it.
[02:32:48.589 --> 02:32:50.690]  But again, I'm no enemy of Israel, folks.
[02:32:50.730 --> 02:32:53.052]  I'm no enemy of Germany, of England, of the U.S.
[02:32:53.072 --> 02:32:53.392]  government.
[02:32:53.432 --> 02:32:54.373]  They're bad people.
[02:32:54.953 --> 02:33:00.696]  Tearing out acts of terror against their own citizens to blame it on foreign enemies is a pretext for war.
[02:33:00.977 --> 02:33:03.038]  You better start figuring this out, folks.
[02:33:03.418 --> 02:33:04.458]  That's what we're focusing on.
[02:33:04.779 --> 02:33:08.501]  Before we go to a final call, Tito, any other key points you want to add here?
[02:33:09.281 --> 02:33:21.268]  Well, I think that we need to really harness the momentum coming out of these admirals and Navy JAG officers that have stepped up after all this time, and we need to
[02:33:21.894 --> 02:33:29.200]  Give very strong support for this crew that's somehow kept up the fight all these years.
[02:33:29.220 --> 02:33:32.243]  That, according to an earlier caller, needed to go ahead and die.
[02:33:32.483 --> 02:33:33.564]  Well, that's outrageous.
[02:33:33.844 --> 02:33:38.768]  I mean, people have been rainwashed, so they're very sympathetic to anything the Israelis do.
[02:33:39.288 --> 02:33:43.172]  And the comment about the evangelicals is unfortunately true.
[02:33:43.672 --> 02:33:47.155]  And I know some, and they're awfully good people, some very good citizens.
[02:33:47.795 --> 02:33:50.898]  But on this issue, it's very, very dangerous for the
[02:33:51.260 --> 02:33:52.102]  Well, look, Dyncor, a U.S.
[02:33:52.122 --> 02:33:56.109]  company, nothing to do with Israel, got caught kidnapping 200,000 women and children.
[02:34:03.596 --> 02:34:05.197]  And along with the U.S.
[02:34:05.278 --> 02:34:08.000]  government and the U.N., and that's mainstream news.
[02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:14.585]  Then I cover what 60 Minutes has, Israel having these big slave brothels of kidnapped women and children.
[02:34:14.925 --> 02:34:16.587]  I've exposed Saudi Arabia, too.
[02:34:16.907 --> 02:34:20.630]  Why is it okay when I expose Saudi Arabia or Bosnia or Daikor?
[02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:21.951]  But I talk about Israel.
[02:34:21.971 --> 02:34:23.392]  Oh, no, they can't do anything wrong.
[02:34:23.612 --> 02:34:24.113]  I know.
[02:34:24.233 --> 02:34:25.153]  It's outrageous.
[02:34:25.254 --> 02:34:27.655]  It's like they're above the law, and that's what's happened here.
[02:34:28.216 --> 02:34:31.639]  We live in a society that's democratic and based on the rule of law.
[02:34:32.461 --> 02:34:34.924]  And we place the Israelis above the law.
[02:34:35.165 --> 02:34:41.533]  There's many instances and proofs of that, but I think the most blatant is the attack on the liberty.
[02:34:41.773 --> 02:34:42.394]  Well, it's like...
[02:34:44.497 --> 02:34:51.161]  It's like Arnold Schwarzenegger says he loves Hitler, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center endorses him, and then you're a Nazi if you're against Nazis.
[02:34:51.221 --> 02:34:55.423]  I mean, I'm not going to sit here and put up with this.
[02:34:55.443 --> 02:34:57.124]  It's like when Israel said, we'll kill U.S.
[02:34:57.164 --> 02:35:00.906]  citizens without a trial in the U.S., and the FBI says no comment.
[02:35:00.946 --> 02:35:01.987]  That's Reuters, folks.
[02:35:02.007 --> 02:35:03.307]  That's absolutely bad.
[02:35:03.427 --> 02:35:04.368]  It's awful, really.
[02:35:04.528 --> 02:35:05.829]  But it's the same thing with the liberty.
[02:35:05.889 --> 02:35:11.811]  But again, it's bigger than Israel, from all the evidence, and the survivors and the people have agreed, you've agreed, that the U.S.
[02:35:11.911 --> 02:35:13.252]  government was orchestrating this.
[02:35:13.312 --> 02:35:15.473]  Final call, Roger in Pennsylvania.
[02:35:15.493 --> 02:35:16.093]  You're on the air.
[02:35:16.133 --> 02:35:16.553]  Go ahead.
[02:35:17.674 --> 02:35:18.614]  Yes, thanks, gentlemen.
[02:35:18.814 --> 02:35:25.057]  And, yeah, just before my real question, I just wanted to respond to Darren in this vein.
[02:35:25.657 --> 02:35:33.721]  And it seems to me if the purpose for Israel was just to disrupt the intelligence-gathering ability and...
[02:35:34.887 --> 02:35:40.932]  Of course, not assuming that would have been a valid objective in advancing Israel's interests, of course.
[02:35:42.834 --> 02:35:51.601]  That, I'm guessing, was accomplished a quarter of the way into the attack with no need to sink the ship otherwise.
[02:35:51.641 --> 02:35:53.362]  Is that a pretty valid surmise?
[02:35:53.723 --> 02:35:57.306]  Well, no, that's true, but there's a lot more to it than that.
[02:35:59.147 --> 02:36:03.791]  The assumption that the Israelis had to knock out the liberty for
[02:36:04.889 --> 02:36:10.254]  The ongoing war and the safety of Israel is just not true.
[02:36:10.714 --> 02:36:11.835]  The war was over.
[02:36:11.875 --> 02:36:23.464]  The Israelis had won the war, but there were three reasons, in my view, that the Israelis attacked the liberty, and that there was some complicity with our government at the highest levels.
[02:36:23.584 --> 02:36:30.770]  I take it no one's ever argued that America would have been in a position of providing information to anyone other than Israel anyway.
[02:36:31.317 --> 02:36:34.538]  Well, there is that, but I mean... Well, go over the three reasons.
[02:36:34.578 --> 02:36:52.521]  We would not do anything that would harm Israel's interest, because we had agreed to the Israeli attack on Egypt, because we had bought the Israeli argument that Nasser was the key to bringing communism to North Africa and the Middle East, which was not true, but that was what was believed.
[02:36:52.581 --> 02:36:57.382]  Tito, days before, days before, you've got...
[02:36:58.098 --> 02:37:00.980]  No, it is outrageous, and it needs to be fully investigated.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.142]  We don't call for a congressional investigation.
[02:37:03.162 --> 02:37:05.083]  It was taken away from the Navy in 1967.
[02:37:27.051 --> 02:37:29.692]  By the political maneuverings of LBJ.
[02:37:29.712 --> 02:37:38.355]  But go over the three points of why... In this order, the Israelis knew that they'd won the war by the 6th of June.
[02:37:39.035 --> 02:37:43.796]  The fly in the ointment for them taking the Golan Heights and all the West Bank was the liberty.
[02:37:44.236 --> 02:37:47.037]  That was a very strong reason for the attack.
[02:37:47.417 --> 02:37:48.838]  They wanted to get it out of the way.
[02:37:49.258 --> 02:37:55.220]  If they could sink it, kill all the survivors, blame it on Egypt, then the second reason would come in.
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:56.020]  If you remember...
[02:37:56.647 --> 02:38:10.059]  Eleven years prior to that, under the cover of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, the Israelis, with military and diplomatic help from the English and the French, attacked Egypt.
[02:38:10.579 --> 02:38:13.502]  The Israelis had gone all the way to the east bank of the canal.
[02:38:14.542 --> 02:38:21.649]  And the United States was not even involved in the decision.
[02:38:21.949 --> 02:38:24.471]  We weren't even told about it, but Eisenhower was president
[02:38:24.946 --> 02:38:25.066]  Okay.
[02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:47.831]  Cut off all aid.
[02:38:47.891 --> 02:38:49.172]  We're out of time.
[02:38:49.452 --> 02:38:52.494]  Obviously sink the ship as a pretext to go into Egypt, expand the war.
[02:38:52.594 --> 02:39:06.263]  Okay, yeah, but the argument here is, and it is very clear, is that in 1956 they were forced out of the Sinai because of world public opinion and American political pressure.
[02:39:06.963 --> 02:39:14.468]  Now, if the liberty sank with the loss of all hands and it was blamed on Egypt, number one, it would have been believed,
[02:39:15.017 --> 02:39:22.441]  And number two, there wouldn't have been any world public opinion against, and there certainly wouldn't have been any American political pressure.
[02:39:22.461 --> 02:39:25.422]  And the Israelis would still be in Sinai.
[02:39:25.902 --> 02:39:28.804]  They'd still be in Sinai, and that's what Northwood says.
[02:39:29.324 --> 02:39:34.787]  It says by blowing up ships, it will cause a helpful wave of indignation to blame on our enemies.
[02:39:36.307 --> 02:39:39.149]  So we understand, and that is so central.
[02:39:39.169 --> 02:39:40.049]  So that's the two points.
[02:39:40.069 --> 02:39:40.829]  What's the third point?
[02:39:40.970 --> 02:39:43.211]  Okay, now you have the three.
[02:39:43.271 --> 02:39:43.771]  Okay, now...
[02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:50.645]  You have to understand the situation of where everything was in 1963.
[02:39:51.806 --> 02:40:02.094]  The Israelis wanted to build the greater Israel.
[02:40:02.154 --> 02:40:07.038]  You know, Golan Heights, Sinai, West Bank, and all of those things.
[02:40:07.838 --> 02:40:10.881]  And if they could bring...
[02:40:11.570 --> 02:40:18.232]  The United States, even into the war from a subjective sense of resupply and so on.
[02:40:18.332 --> 02:40:19.873]  Looks like the Lusitania.
[02:40:20.633 --> 02:40:21.774]  Similar, similar.
[02:40:22.414 --> 02:40:34.678]  And, you know, if one looks at all of the preparation that went into this, and we have to remember that this decision had to be made very high up at the time.
[02:40:35.259 --> 02:40:37.340]  Levi Eshkol was the Prime Minister.
[02:40:37.500 --> 02:40:41.381]  And within an hour of the attack going, we already have LBJ knowing all the details.
[02:40:42.021 --> 02:40:50.084]  And ordering us back, although nobody could know it was Israelis, so somebody here had to be involved, had to be people around LBJ.
[02:40:50.664 --> 02:40:53.205]  And Alex, just one other comment, if I might.
[02:40:53.265 --> 02:41:04.328]  We have to remember that at that time, you had Walter Rostow, who was Chief of Staff and Chief Security Guy, a big Zionist, and his brother...
[02:41:05.420 --> 02:41:21.646]  Eugene Rostow, who later was head of American negotiations with the Russians on disarmament, Eugene Rostow was undersecretary of state and in charge of the Mideast desk in the State Department.
[02:41:21.666 --> 02:41:22.907]  Okay, I've got to end it there.
[02:41:23.847 --> 02:41:24.867]  Thanks for the call, Roger.
[02:41:24.987 --> 02:41:29.629]  Tito and Howard are going to be back on with some of the officers and some of the survivors.
[02:41:29.649 --> 02:41:31.430]  You can line up three or four of them if you want.
[02:41:32.137 --> 02:41:34.938]  You know, every 30 minutes I want to have a different one on for about two hours.
[02:41:35.098 --> 02:41:35.899]  That'll be great.
[02:41:36.019 --> 02:41:37.979]  I'm going to try and set it up for Thursday and Friday.
[02:41:37.999 --> 02:41:39.660]  I'm meeting with the admirals tomorrow.
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:40.360]  Great.
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:43.582]  And once I know how that's going, then I'll call Captain Boston.
[02:41:43.642 --> 02:41:47.163]  And we'll get you some people Thursday, Friday, Monday latest.
[02:41:47.803 --> 02:41:47.943]  Okay.
[02:41:47.983 --> 02:41:49.364]  But we'll coordinate that with you.
[02:41:49.764 --> 02:41:51.305]  But call me if you would.
[02:41:52.925 --> 02:41:56.026]  Tomorrow evening or early Thursday morning.
[02:41:56.246 --> 02:41:57.906]  Yeah, well, just go ahead when you talk to them.
[02:41:57.946 --> 02:41:58.886]  Find out what's good for them.
[02:41:58.926 --> 02:42:03.848]  Go ahead and try to set them up for Thursday or Friday from noon central on, and we'll do two hours on it.
[02:42:04.248 --> 02:42:08.589]  And one more time, that mailing address for folks that want to get a copy of Loss of Liberty.
[02:42:09.669 --> 02:42:11.209]  Okay, it's box.
[02:42:11.389 --> 02:42:12.890]  First, it's Liberty Alliance.
[02:42:13.050 --> 02:42:14.990]  This is Chairman Admiral Moore.
[02:42:16.131 --> 02:42:22.132]  Send to the Liberty Alliance box 663, front royal, two words.
[02:42:22.782 --> 02:42:25.326]  Virginia, that's the capital of the Shenandoah.
[02:42:26.008 --> 02:42:27.069]  Front Royal, Virginia, 22630.
[02:42:27.109 --> 02:42:29.193]  It's $25 for a single copy, $50 for three.
[02:42:29.594 --> 02:42:30.996]  Make the check payable to Howard Films.
[02:42:37.185 --> 02:42:38.185]  All right, Howard Films.
[02:42:39.065 --> 02:42:40.346]  Tito, thanks for coming on the show.
[02:42:40.526 --> 02:42:42.626]  All right, thank you, Alex, for the opportunity.
[02:42:42.726 --> 02:42:43.066]  You bet.
[02:42:43.086 --> 02:42:43.767]  I appreciate it.
[02:42:44.367 --> 02:42:53.669]  And if some of that sounded a little helter-skelter, folks, just it's so many facts, so many witnesses, so many documents, so many different angles here.
[02:42:54.629 --> 02:42:55.509]  But this is what I do.
[02:42:55.629 --> 02:42:57.069]  I expose government-sponsored terror.
[02:42:57.810 --> 02:43:01.651]  And our government clearly was operating under Operation Northwoods.
[02:43:01.811 --> 02:43:03.611]  It's exactly what's in there.
[02:43:04.594 --> 02:43:07.797]  The sniper attacks, the hijacked jets, all of it.
[02:43:08.317 --> 02:43:09.478]  Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:43:10.559 --> 02:43:15.903]  Hitler did it with attacking his own radio men on the Polish border and then blaming it on Poland.
[02:43:15.963 --> 02:43:18.626]  I mean, it's what these governments do.
[02:43:19.106 --> 02:43:20.988]  And I don't care what government you are.
[02:43:21.028 --> 02:43:25.431]  You start killing American citizens and killing our troops, I'm going to expose you.
[02:43:25.711 --> 02:43:27.193]  You killed Yashak Rabin.
[02:43:27.573 --> 02:43:28.674]  We exposed that.
[02:43:29.511 --> 02:43:29.951]  We're good to go.
[02:43:53.484 --> 02:43:57.325]  To have somebody who sounded like a nice guy, believing he was saying the right thing.
[02:43:57.345 --> 02:44:00.986]  He didn't sound like a bad person, going, well, this just had to happen to our troops.
[02:44:01.546 --> 02:44:02.186]  It's sick.
[02:44:02.286 --> 02:44:03.066]  It's insane.
[02:44:03.106 --> 02:44:03.847]  It's nuts.
[02:44:05.467 --> 02:44:07.227]  I appreciate her holding the last 12 minutes.
[02:44:07.508 --> 02:44:13.249]  And then in the final segment, I'm going to hit some really key news stuff about what's happening to veterans right now.
[02:44:13.289 --> 02:44:15.149]  But before we do that, Debbie, thanks for holding.
[02:44:15.810 --> 02:44:16.950]  New Millennium Concepts.
[02:44:17.811 --> 02:44:21.293]  If folks believe in what we're doing, they should, number one, stop poisoning themselves with water.
[02:44:21.333 --> 02:44:22.814]  Number two, this supports the broadcast.
[02:44:23.295 --> 02:44:26.737]  Debbie, you've got some new holiday specials for us on the water filters.
[02:44:27.418 --> 02:44:27.939]  I do.
[02:44:27.959 --> 02:44:29.019]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:44:29.420 --> 02:44:29.940]  Pretty good.
[02:44:30.201 --> 02:44:30.581]  Good.
[02:44:30.921 --> 02:44:33.003]  We have two different sets of specials.
[02:44:33.523 --> 02:44:37.407]  One is the holiday special, and then we have the November special.
[02:44:37.887 --> 02:44:47.135]  The holiday special will go through Christmas, probably through the new year, and then the November special will just be from now until the end of the month.
[02:44:47.595 --> 02:44:50.038]  Let me go over the November special first.
[02:44:50.899 --> 02:44:54.601]  It's really good because people have been waiting for this for a long time.
[02:44:55.021 --> 02:45:06.988]  We now have a huge supply of the PF2 fluoride reduction elements that work in conjunction with the black Berkey filters to take out the fluoride from the water.
[02:45:07.808 --> 02:45:10.969]  So what we're doing is we're giving them away for free.
[02:45:11.089 --> 02:45:25.594]  If someone buys a Berkey light with the lights, whether they want to get white lights or blue lights, it doesn't matter, they actually get the set of PF2 fluoride reduction filters absolutely free, which they're normally $49.
[02:45:26.135 --> 02:45:32.237]  And a lot of people have been waiting to get those fluoride filters, so now we're making it available.
[02:45:33.624 --> 02:45:50.641]  If they don't want the fluoride filters, but they still want to get in on a good deal, then we've got the Berkey light with the light, and they can get an extra set of the black Berkey elements for half price, which is normally $96, and they'll get it for $48.
[02:45:51.341 --> 02:45:54.805]  So both of those November specials,
[02:45:55.689 --> 02:45:57.750]  Our good ones to get into now.
[02:45:58.130 --> 02:45:59.271]  Well, the going's good.
[02:45:59.431 --> 02:46:08.616]  Again, this is a top-of-the-line filtration system with the added post filter to knock out the fluoride and some of the stuff that all the other filters don't cut out, folks.
[02:46:09.356 --> 02:46:11.618]  This is an amazing system, a great value.
[02:46:12.398 --> 02:46:13.579]  You need to take advantage of it.
[02:46:13.619 --> 02:46:19.902]  If you already have a big Berkey or you want replacement elements for it, the new black Berkey element, or you want to give it as a gift to family,
[02:46:20.522 --> 02:46:27.865]  The water is just full of hormones and Prozac and herbicide and pesticide and dead bacteria.
[02:46:27.965 --> 02:46:29.006]  Stop drinking it!
[02:46:29.566 --> 02:46:31.027]  I was talking to my uncle this weekend.
[02:46:31.187 --> 02:46:33.128]  We went to, of course, a funeral for my grandmother.
[02:46:33.148 --> 02:46:39.430]  And he said, Alex, because I drink out of a water filter and a Berkey.
[02:46:39.491 --> 02:46:42.752]  And he said, after drinking tap water, I mean, it tastes like poison.
[02:46:43.502 --> 02:46:44.203]  You're good to go.
[02:46:44.223 --> 02:46:44.403]  I think?
[02:47:07.919 --> 02:47:16.307]  You've got this great survival buoy, basically is what this gravity-fed filter is, with the best filters you can imagine in there.
[02:47:16.727 --> 02:47:20.851]  On top of it, the post filters that cut out the floor and a couple other nasty things.
[02:47:20.871 --> 02:47:22.513]  You get the cleanest water really possible.
[02:47:23.173 --> 02:47:31.437]  This is so important to make this call and to take advantage of this and to take control of your lives and stop drinking the poison.
[02:47:32.097 --> 02:47:34.178]  Folks can call Debbie right now at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:47:34.218 --> 02:47:34.478]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[02:47:34.498 --> 02:47:35.058]  Anything else Debbie?
[02:47:43.682 --> 02:47:59.048]  Well, we do have the holiday special, and anyone can call me if they need to review what they are, but we do have some really good buy four and get a discount, buy five, get a discount of the Berkey Sport bottles for $99.
[02:47:59.349 --> 02:48:02.430]  You can get five of the generic.
[02:48:03.150 --> 02:48:08.975]  Or you can mix and match with potassium iodate, and you can get 10 or 12 of each.
[02:48:09.015 --> 02:48:13.758]  And these are portable mini-filters that cut out a lot of the garbage, not everything like the big filter.
[02:48:13.939 --> 02:48:14.959]  Yes, that's right.
[02:48:15.099 --> 02:48:16.040]  And they're real handy.
[02:48:16.060 --> 02:48:16.741]  Take everywhere.
[02:48:16.761 --> 02:48:22.145]  You know, take them while you're out shopping, take them when you go to work, and that way you have good water everywhere.
[02:48:22.285 --> 02:48:24.587]  It's great for the grandchildren, a great gift, folks.
[02:48:24.607 --> 02:48:24.687]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:48:24.727 --> 02:48:27.769]  How many gallons in its lifetime will a sport Berkey do?
[02:48:33.073 --> 02:48:39.195]  Actually, I've never figured out how many gallons, but it does up to 640 refills of city water.
[02:48:39.215 --> 02:48:43.017]  So, I mean, 640 refills of 22 ounces.
[02:48:43.437 --> 02:48:50.519]  If you bought a bottle of water at the store for a dollar a bottle, you know, when you're on the go, that'd be $640.
[02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:51.640]  Yeah.
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:54.201]  Yeah, I mean, it's such an incredible savings.
[02:48:54.501 --> 02:48:55.541]  And they're really handy.
[02:48:55.561 --> 02:48:56.442]  You just take them everywhere.
[02:48:56.462 --> 02:48:56.902]  I was at a...
[02:48:58.122 --> 02:49:14.153]  Saturday, at a school, doing a little trade show thing with my girlfriend, and I had my sport berkey with me, and one of the teachers had mentioned that her son was over somewhere where she wasn't allowed to know because he was a SEAL, and we were talking about water and things, so I gave her my sport bottle.
[02:49:14.173 --> 02:49:16.114]  I said, would you please just mail this to him?
[02:49:16.475 --> 02:49:17.996]  That would bless me so much.
[02:49:18.016 --> 02:49:18.396]  Yeah, the U.S.
[02:49:18.416 --> 02:49:19.817]  government won't give them filters.
[02:49:19.857 --> 02:49:22.519]  They make Halliburton truck it in because they make more money off of it.
[02:49:22.539 --> 02:49:22.579]  888-803-4438.
[02:49:26.161 --> 02:49:27.242]  Yeah, send some to the troops.
[02:49:27.302 --> 02:49:27.943]  Thanks, Debbie.
[02:49:28.824 --> 02:49:30.986]  Final comments, final news, straight ahead.
[02:49:31.006 --> 02:49:31.586]  Stay with us.
[02:49:33.068 --> 02:49:37.412]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:37.572 --> 02:49:42.016]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:42.156 --> 02:49:46.540]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:49:46.580 --> 02:49:47.902]  The New World Order.
[02:49:49.702 --> 02:49:53.904]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:53.984 --> 02:50:00.907]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:50:01.047 --> 02:50:03.068]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:50:03.428 --> 02:50:06.490]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[02:50:06.670 --> 02:50:13.774]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:50:14.034 --> 02:50:19.397]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:50:19.917 --> 02:50:22.578]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:50:22.678 --> 02:50:23.439]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:50:23.459 --> 02:50:23.839]  That's 888.
[02:50:28.541 --> 02:50:28.621]  253-3139.
[02:50:28.741 --> 02:50:32.043]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:50:32.343 --> 02:50:39.866]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[02:50:40.126 --> 02:50:53.131]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:50:53.391 --> 02:50:56.692]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:57.052 --> 02:51:07.518]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:51:07.799 --> 02:51:08.299]  That's right.
[02:51:08.479 --> 02:51:15.603]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:51:15.883 --> 02:51:24.468]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:51:32.651 --> 02:51:35.672]  You are sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[02:51:35.812 --> 02:51:41.533]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw food.
[02:51:41.693 --> 02:51:43.033]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[02:51:43.213 --> 02:51:47.234]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[02:51:47.394 --> 02:51:53.196]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[02:51:53.736 --> 02:51:55.978]  The two most complete protein superfoods known.
[02:51:56.338 --> 02:51:58.800]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water.
[02:51:59.140 --> 02:52:06.265]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you to homeostasis.
[02:52:06.565 --> 02:52:10.247]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[02:52:10.528 --> 02:52:13.109]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[02:52:13.370 --> 02:52:18.313]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.
[02:52:18.593 --> 02:52:20.154]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:52:20.354 --> 02:52:21.895]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:44.523 --> 02:52:51.137]  We put a little 10-minute compilation from police state free total enslavement on Infowars.com for free.
[02:52:51.157 --> 02:52:55.907]  You want to download it, email it out to friends, mirror the video on your website.
[02:52:57.446 --> 02:52:59.047]  Folks won't know about the USS Liberty.
[02:52:59.067 --> 02:53:01.790]  They won't know about the Bushes funding Hitler.
[02:53:02.430 --> 02:53:08.035]  They won't know about the woman that claimed that Bush raped her being shot in the head a couple weeks ago, now in the Houston Chronicle.
[02:53:08.455 --> 02:53:13.379]  They won't know about Barbara Bush threatening, if anybody talks bad about my family, they're dead.
[02:53:13.880 --> 02:53:23.848]  They won't know about it unless you spread the word about Infowars.com, about the videos, about what we're doing to fight the globalists and government-sponsored terror, no matter who carries it out.
[02:53:24.409 --> 02:53:26.290]  Get my new video, Matrix of Evil.
[02:53:26.310 --> 02:53:27.912]  Get 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[02:53:27.932 --> 02:53:28.632]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:28.652 --> 02:53:29.012]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:53:29.132 --> 02:53:30.974]  To get the videos, they're $25.95 apiece.
[02:53:30.994 --> 02:53:33.235]  Order three or more, they drop down to $20 apiece.
[02:53:33.255 --> 02:53:36.458]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:53:52.458 --> 02:53:58.280]  And your purchase does support this show and makes guests like you just heard possible so millions can hear the truth.
[02:53:59.741 --> 02:54:01.081]  Oh man, there is so much news here.
[02:54:01.101 --> 02:54:01.422]  Look at this.
[02:54:01.622 --> 02:54:04.303]  Ludicrous EU official ready to ban yogurt.
[02:54:04.403 --> 02:54:12.166]  Officials at the European Commission are preparing to ban yogurt from Britain because it does not conform to their definition of a standardized Euro pudding.
[02:54:13.502 --> 02:54:14.323]  Another article here.
[02:54:14.463 --> 02:54:21.388]  They're talking about bringing in for questioning, possibly indicting a bishop because he said that people could reform themselves and not be homosexual.
[02:54:21.428 --> 02:54:22.288]  That is a thought crime.
[02:54:22.308 --> 02:54:24.410]  Talk about 1984.
[02:54:24.530 --> 02:54:27.072]  This is out of the London Guardian here, folks.
[02:54:27.892 --> 02:54:29.153]  Also, U.S.
[02:54:29.173 --> 02:54:31.455]  blocks payout to Gulf War veterans.
[02:54:31.495 --> 02:54:34.156]  London Guardian, the Bush administration, has blocked compensation for U.S.
[02:54:34.537 --> 02:54:36.718]  soldiers captured and tortured during the first Gulf War.
[02:54:36.838 --> 02:54:41.842]  Argument that money was now needed for Iraq's reconstruction, veterans' lawyers said yesterday.
[02:54:42.768 --> 02:54:45.430]  Well, I guess, you know, the troops are traitors if they ask for their money.
[02:54:46.410 --> 02:54:51.493]  Again, they're traitors if they don't take their shirts off so enemy troops can shoot them easier.
[02:54:51.914 --> 02:54:53.294]  You know, this is the new patriotism.
[02:54:54.235 --> 02:54:56.076]  Mystery illness causing major U.S.
[02:54:56.096 --> 02:54:57.157]  casualties in Iraq.
[02:54:57.197 --> 02:54:58.037]  American Free Press.
[02:54:58.578 --> 02:55:07.743]  The overwhelming majority of soldiers sent home from recovery from current Persian Gulf War were not injured in combat, but probably by a doctor's needle, and it gets into details of that.
[02:55:07.763 --> 02:55:09.064]  We're going to have James talk around about that.
[02:55:10.285 --> 02:55:20.717]  Army orders a mother of seven back to duty in Iraq, despite the fact she may lose custody of her children because her husband's in the military too.
[02:55:21.298 --> 02:55:22.139]  They say they don't care.
[02:55:22.159 --> 02:55:25.463]  He's been ordered back on that plane and then flying out of the country.
[02:55:26.590 --> 02:55:28.372]  Another article here out of the Washington Post.
[02:55:28.412 --> 02:55:31.575]  Not enough troops for Veterans Day parades, even as thousands of U.S.
[02:55:31.595 --> 02:55:33.376]  troops are stationed in war zones abroad.
[02:55:33.416 --> 02:55:34.617]  Yeah, 160 countries.
[02:55:35.158 --> 02:55:38.521]  Plans for Veterans Day parades across the country are being scaled back or scrapped.
[02:55:38.561 --> 02:55:39.122]  No problem.
[02:55:39.642 --> 02:55:40.343]  Not enough troops.
[02:55:40.403 --> 02:55:47.189]  Thanks for Humvees to wow the patriotic crowds with a large number of active and reserve units called up.
[02:55:47.229 --> 02:55:50.732]  A lot of them would normally be available, but they're not available.
[02:55:50.812 --> 02:55:52.394]  See how serious this is?
[02:55:53.547 --> 02:55:57.472]  And they are basically declaring martial law for three days in London.
[02:55:57.512 --> 02:56:00.235]  When Bush travels there, you're not going to be allowed to protest in most of the city.
[02:56:02.398 --> 02:56:03.599]  And again, they'd like to do that here.
[02:56:03.619 --> 02:56:05.562]  It would be like Mexico where they don't allow protest.
[02:56:06.460 --> 02:56:09.242]  Also, a plan for UN to run the Internet will be shelved.
[02:56:09.302 --> 02:56:18.670]  Financial Times of London, an attempt by developing countries to put management of the Internet under the United Nations auspices, is likely to be shelved at next month's World Information Summit in Geneva.
[02:56:18.890 --> 02:56:22.352]  But the issue is now firmly on the International Agenda Summit, sources say.
[02:56:22.833 --> 02:56:24.234]  And that's taxation of the net.
[02:56:24.254 --> 02:56:26.756]  They already control the IP addresses.
[02:56:27.722 --> 02:56:31.343]  Jessica's hustled a skin mag plane yesterday.
[02:56:31.403 --> 02:56:36.984]  It has pictures of Iraq POW Jessica Lynch frolicking topless with male soldiers before she went off to war.
[02:56:38.304 --> 02:56:41.745]  And spokesman for the 20-year-old Army private, the subject of Sunday's TV movie.
