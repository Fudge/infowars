[00:00:05.492 --> 00:00:09.676]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.336 --> 00:00:11.137]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:12.819]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.182]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:21.766]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:27.652]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:32.319]  It's Wednesday, the 10th of December, 2003.
[00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.099]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:36.060]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:51.924]  In the third hour of the show, I have one of the lawyers for the young people at Goose Creek Public School, where the police did what can only be described as a Nazi or Soviet-style martial law raid.
[00:00:52.648 --> 00:01:17.934]  These have actually been going on around the country for about ten years, becoming more and more frequent, but Big Brother's own surveillance turned against them, and now part of the video that wasn't released has been released, and it shows the dog, the German Shepherd, savaging their backpacks, grabbing the backpack, shaking its head, stepping and stomping and jumping on the terrified children.
[00:01:19.804 --> 00:01:24.608]  Not to mention the loaded firearms pointed at their heads.
[00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:32.315]  And the comments of the police officers of, if you don't have anything to hide, what's your problem with this?
[00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:38.060]  Comments that, well, there's dope in the school, so you all are being punished.
[00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:41.143]  Again, it's admiralty law.
[00:01:41.744 --> 00:01:45.167]  It's the new system here in the United States.
[00:01:47.692 --> 00:02:04.268]  On Monday, it began to sink in, but it's really sunk in now, how incredible, on top of Bush's latest comments yesterday, while meeting with the Communist Chinese deputy leader, began to sink in how big a deal this is.
[00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.192]  Because in the past, we had a treaty to defend Taiwan.
[00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:09.453]  We said that they were independent since 1949.
[00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:17.262]  And Bush, engaging in masterful spin, says, oh, we're for the status quo.
[00:02:17.302 --> 00:02:18.663]  We're against your independence.
[00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:20.304]  You're not an independent country.
[00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:24.947]  And has rebuffed the Taiwanese leader.
[00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.172]  Imagine, America is now against free countries standing up against communist domination.
[00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:37.315]  Bill Clinton could have never gotten away with this.
[00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:38.216]  He was horrible.
[00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:38.917]  He was evil.
[00:02:38.957 --> 00:02:39.677]  He was a puppet.
[00:02:40.097 --> 00:02:41.879]  But George W. can do it.
[00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:42.839]  He can do things.
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.561]  He can ban guns.
[00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:46.182]  He can vote for open borders.
[00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:48.583]  He can sign campaign finance reform.
[00:02:48.864 --> 00:02:51.325]  He can do whatever he wants.
[00:02:51.505 --> 00:03:02.033]  And the idiot neocon listeners of controlled establishment fake conservative radio will buy it book, line, and sinker it.
[00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:09.005]  Taiwan says vote still on despite Bush warning.
[00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:12.388]  Taiwan now has China and the U.S.
[00:03:12.428 --> 00:03:21.215]  against it, and our government indeed is arming China with the latest weapons while giving Taiwan 30-year-old technology.
[00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:22.756]  It is saddening.
[00:03:23.957 --> 00:03:30.483]  But again, maybe Bill Gertz will write a column saying I'm a communist because I'm for Taiwan and against mainland China.
[00:03:32.091 --> 00:03:36.892]  Maybe Rush Limbaugh will tell us how evil and liberal we are because we're for Taiwan.
[00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:43.514]  I mean, I've been on talk shows and been accused of being a liberal because I'm zero compromise on the Second Amendment.
[00:03:44.714 --> 00:03:46.415]  I'm not joking about this, folks.
[00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:48.615]  This is how far we've gone.
[00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:52.696]  Taiwan says vote's still on despite Bush warning.
[00:03:52.716 --> 00:03:53.296]  We'll get into that.
[00:03:53.317 --> 00:03:58.778]  Taiwan's chin still bent on referendum plans despite personal rebuke from U.S.,
[00:04:01.348 --> 00:04:03.589]  17 students file suit over school drug raid.
[00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:04.609]  We have their lawyer coming on.
[00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:10.010]  Raid might have broken drug dog rules, the county's own rules.
[00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:17.913]  Supreme Court upholds political money law, upholds Bush's and Kennedy's attack on the First Amendment.
[00:04:19.073 --> 00:04:19.473]  Also...
[00:04:21.105 --> 00:04:22.847]  Schindler writes, Getting a loan?
[00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:24.348]  Big Brother wants to know.
[00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:25.809]  We'll wait to hear about this.
[00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:28.531]  Six children die in fresh U.S.
[00:04:28.591 --> 00:04:28.932]  blunder.
[00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:32.675]  Meanwhile, Iraq to stop counting civilian debt under U.S.
[00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:32.995]  orders.
[00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:34.796]  That's not to be released.
[00:04:35.457 --> 00:04:38.839]  White House defends no-bid policy in Iraq.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.463]  And, of course, James Baker's going to run doling out the money to Dick Cheney.
[00:04:45.144 --> 00:04:45.545]  Jail.
[00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:48.689]  Cut for man who stabbed Burtler to death.
[00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:49.449]  Oh, how nice.
[00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.972]  He only gets three years in prison in Scotland for defending himself.
[00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:57.676]  And they're about to go on the market with your implantable chip for buying and selling.
[00:04:57.696 --> 00:04:58.417]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:04.862]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.042 --> 00:05:09.466]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:09.606 --> 00:05:13.990]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.371]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.111 --> 00:05:17.132]  Can emerge.
[00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:21.357]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.437 --> 00:05:28.365]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:28.505 --> 00:05:30.508]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:30.888 --> 00:05:41.214]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:41.494 --> 00:05:46.837]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:53.953]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[00:07:01.144 --> 00:07:01.484]  We're good to go.
[00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:25.779]  We're good to go.
[00:08:05.176 --> 00:08:05.836]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.477 --> 00:08:07.537]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.258 --> 00:08:09.418]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.998 --> 00:08:10.839]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:12.540]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.902]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.342 --> 00:08:19.683]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:08:20.578 --> 00:08:21.438]  Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.859 --> 00:08:27.480]  That's right, my friends.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.441]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:37.262]  Hey, did you know that Mel Gibson was in Austin, Texas on Sunday?
[00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:46.865]  He showed up unannounced at Harry Knoll's little film festival at the Alamo Draft House in Austin and showed...
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:55.366]  Well, it's not the final cut of The Passion or Christ the Passion or The Passion of Christ.
[00:08:55.886 --> 00:09:01.271]  They've been changing the name around because one of the big Hollywood studios claimed they own the name The Passion.
[00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:13.541]  And it even convinced the local liberals, and this was in the newspaper, that the ADL was shooting blanks in its criticism of the film as anti-Semitic.
[00:09:14.081 --> 00:09:16.103]  I mean, it's word for word from the Bible.
[00:09:16.944 --> 00:09:25.313]  But to see a news article yesterday in the Statesman, very pro-Mel Gibson, was certainly exciting.
[00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:36.726]  Speaking of the Alamo Draft House, I will be at the Houston Alamo Draft House this Saturday from 6 to midnight, showing Road to Tyranny and John Carpenter's They Live!
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.240]  We're good to go.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:38.781]  We're good to go.
[00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:02.844]  But I just hope to see everybody out there.
[00:10:02.924 --> 00:10:07.187]  It's a great place to network and to meet like-minded people.
[00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.428]  And they're both great films.
[00:10:09.488 --> 00:10:18.533]  John Carpenter's They Live is a good analogy for getting your mind outside the box to see the big picture of the false reality.
[00:10:18.713 --> 00:10:25.537]  And Road to Tyranny details government-sponsored terror and the New World Order master plan for global domination this Saturday.
[00:10:25.857 --> 00:10:27.118]  West Oak Shopping Center.
[00:10:28.226 --> 00:10:29.846]  In Houston, Texas.
[00:10:30.367 --> 00:10:33.287]  And details of that are at Infowars.com.
[00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:42.389]  In the last segment, that I know a lot of stations don't carry, the first little five-minute segment, I talked about how it's starting to sink in.
[00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:50.491]  How horrible it is that Bush did something that Clinton never even began to do.
[00:10:51.872 --> 00:10:53.774]  Bush has turned his back on Taiwan.
[00:10:53.814 --> 00:11:11.308]  Now, in reality, Bill Clinton sold the latest weapons systems and allowed Loral and Hughes, which were controlled by big neocon owners, to go into China and arm them to the teeth so they could destroy the entire United States and destroy Taiwan.
[00:11:12.148 --> 00:11:12.608]  I think.
[00:11:39.552 --> 00:11:45.975]  Cruise missile diagrams, cruise missile factories, you name it, it's gotten much worse under Bush.
[00:11:47.356 --> 00:11:53.118]  But again, Bill Gertz, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, they won't tell you about it.
[00:11:53.158 --> 00:11:56.400]  Mr. Crystal, they won't tell you about it.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.622]  They'll say, if you criticize Bush, you love Al-Qaeda, and you're evil.
[00:12:01.882 --> 00:12:06.424]  I mean, that's basically about as deep as the argument goes, a nice little slogan.
[00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:20.699]  But to have Bush have one of his spokesmen on Monday say, hey, Taiwan, you better not have independence, that's wrong, and then to have Bush in a speech yesterday to tell Taiwan that independence is bad when the treaty since 1949...
[00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.591]  Says that they are independent, and we will defend them and their independence against China.
[00:12:29.152 --> 00:12:32.732]  Bush has now turned his back on that, and he calls that the status quo.
[00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:38.654]  Oh, we're for the status quo, and then changes a 54-year policy.
[00:12:39.874 --> 00:12:51.697]  Now, again, China has killed conservatively, conservatively, 50 million of its own people.
[00:12:52.754 --> 00:12:55.895]  They have mobile death vans in dozens of cities.
[00:12:56.336 --> 00:13:03.018]  In one city, they have 24 alone driving around with automatic injectors in the seats.
[00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:06.680]  They then gut you for your organs in the back.
[00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:10.131]  They esanguate you, suck all your blood out.
[00:13:10.932 --> 00:13:23.182]  This was described in Chinese and Western newspapers like it was a report on the latest way to farm strawberries or how to make cheese or something.
[00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:27.106]  It was just calmly being reported how they supply the premium organs.
[00:13:27.794 --> 00:13:37.878]  And it showed them dragging a young woman, choking her with looks of pleasure on the police faces, to the mobile death van and said that she had been a political dissident who'd spoken out against China.
[00:13:38.298 --> 00:13:39.518]  No judge, no jury.
[00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:43.320]  They just pick you up and suck your blood out and cut your guts out.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.781]  I mean, I'm sorry if you don't want to hear how gruesome this is.
[00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:47.861]  I mean, it's what's happening.
[00:13:49.502 --> 00:13:55.924]  China will arrest you, will torture you, will kill you, will put you in a slave camp for years if you're caught with a Bible.
[00:13:57.961 --> 00:14:01.723]  After all, it's unauthorized religious activity.
[00:14:01.763 --> 00:14:05.545]  Gotta have your 501c3 over there.
[00:14:06.786 --> 00:14:07.726]  Like our church is here.
[00:14:09.948 --> 00:14:11.788]  And so this is the reality, folks.
[00:14:12.169 --> 00:14:16.791]  And China has killed more people than the communists in Russia.
[00:14:17.792 --> 00:14:20.213]  And all their murders in Eastern Bloc nations.
[00:14:20.953 --> 00:14:25.516]  They have killed more people, roughly double what Adolf Hitler ever killed.
[00:14:27.385 --> 00:14:30.606]  And, again, they don't even call them communists in the news anymore.
[00:14:30.646 --> 00:14:32.027]  They're our buddies.
[00:14:32.567 --> 00:14:45.051]  Every single week, Communist China in its official government newspaper says we are evil dogs, that they're going to nuke us, that they're going to kill us, that we're their enemy, that they're going to crush us.
[00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:50.352]  And then I turn on our nightly news, and it's how they love us and how they're good.
[00:14:54.173 --> 00:14:55.594]  Are you starting to get the picture here?
[00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:57.129]  I think.
[00:14:57.149 --> 00:14:57.309]  I think.
[00:15:24.028 --> 00:15:29.812]  Rumsfeld's giving nuclear reactors, working with Clinton back in the late 90s, to North Korea.
[00:15:29.852 --> 00:15:33.295]  But again, the neocons talk about Clinton being bad, Rumsfeld being good.
[00:15:33.755 --> 00:15:34.676]  It's garbage!
[00:15:36.097 --> 00:15:44.603]  And then in this election or the next election, you'll get a Democrat in, and suddenly all the leftists will love the Patriot Act and the rest of it, and the globalists will take a big step with the left foot.
[00:15:44.803 --> 00:15:47.785]  Then a Republican will come back in, take a big step with the right foot.
[00:15:48.105 --> 00:15:49.967]  It's all part of the same creature.
[00:15:52.168 --> 00:15:52.909]  It's all part...
[00:15:53.439 --> 00:15:54.720]  Of the same system.
[00:15:57.522 --> 00:15:58.763]  And we're losing America.
[00:15:58.823 --> 00:16:06.769]  And the New York Times comes out and says, oh, if SARS gets released, we're going to round you up and put you in these camps at gunpoint for your safety.
[00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:15.916]  Oh, and General Eberhardt at the NORTHCOM command says, well, martial law is a good thing, and the military is spying on you, and it's wonderful.
[00:16:15.936 --> 00:16:19.018]  He said that in the LA Times, and it's for your safety, and
[00:16:19.885 --> 00:16:30.516]  At Fort Bragg, they're getting training from the Israelis of not just how to, quote, suppress and keep control of the unruly Iraqi population, but our population as well.
[00:16:32.578 --> 00:16:35.941]  Taiwan says vote's still on despite Bush warning.
[00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:51.034]  Brushing aside a warning from George W. Bush, since when did that happen, Taiwan's president reiterated his plan to hold a referendum alongside elections next March, but said neither independence nor the status quo with China would be at issue.
[00:16:53.055 --> 00:17:05.766]  After Bush delivered his surprise warning during a White House visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, did not say what the referendum would be about.
[00:17:05.826 --> 00:17:18.958]  But earlier he suggested it would pressure China to remove missiles aimed at the island, which Beijing sees as a breakaway province that must one day, even by force, be returned to the fold.
[00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:21.112]  We're good to go.
[00:17:37.512 --> 00:17:44.576]  Taiwan's people have the right to say loudly that they oppose missiles and are for democracy.
[00:17:44.736 --> 00:17:45.116]  Oh, really?
[00:17:45.496 --> 00:17:48.118]  Oppose war and are for peace, he said.
[00:17:48.178 --> 00:17:49.639]  This has nothing to do with independence.
[00:17:49.899 --> 00:17:52.240]  There is no intention to change the status quo.
[00:17:55.082 --> 00:18:02.746]  So Taiwan's chin still bent on referendum plans despite personal rebuke from Lord Bush.
[00:18:07.146 --> 00:18:15.492]  And in Iraq, folks, they've killed a bunch of children, they're bombing innocent people, they're stringing barbed wire up around whole towns, making people carry ID cards.
[00:18:16.232 --> 00:18:24.918]  And they admit, they've got an army colonel here in the New York Times saying, yeah, we take their women and children and put them in camps to make the men answer questions.
[00:18:26.019 --> 00:18:33.884]  Folks, think of all the historical examples of people kidnapping people's children to make others answer questions.
[00:18:34.284 --> 00:18:35.725]  One of the worst forms of torture.
[00:18:36.673 --> 00:18:44.360]  And in Police State 3, Total Enslavement, I have little news clips where they're arguing, well, let's use people's children as leverage.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.882]  Let's go ahead and torture them.
[00:18:46.222 --> 00:18:48.364]  Yeah, that's a good American value.
[00:18:48.384 --> 00:18:55.751]  And then the neocon zone PNAC documents say Saddam wasn't a threat.
[00:18:55.791 --> 00:18:56.572]  We want his oil.
[00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:59.670]  We need terrorism to get the people behind all this.
[00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.111]  I mean, this is sick, folks.
[00:19:01.451 --> 00:19:08.514]  And now the White House has ordered their puppet leadership in Iraq to restrict the release of names of dead Iraqi civilians.
[00:19:10.475 --> 00:19:11.256]  Lying to you.
[00:19:11.356 --> 00:19:12.576]  Keeping the truth from you.
[00:19:13.177 --> 00:19:17.439]  Again, everything diametrically opposed to American values.
[00:19:19.306 --> 00:19:23.130]  Well, it's okay, because George W. Bush is a Christian.
[00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:30.657]  Yeah, a Christian Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove member, about as Christian as Anton LaVey.
[00:19:31.078 --> 00:19:33.240]  He's not worshiping Allah.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.082]  He's off at the Shinto Shrine.
[00:19:37.284 --> 00:19:41.448]  We'll be right back, folks, and get into all the other news.
[00:19:41.508 --> 00:19:42.489]  And believe me, there's a lot of it.
[00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:43.170]  You don't want to miss it.

[00:20:59.918 --> 00:21:01.898]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:21:01.978 --> 00:21:02.638]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:02.758 --> 00:21:12.680]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 fluoride and arsenic reduction elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:17.601]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:21:17.661 --> 00:21:28.983]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste, and odors are separated from the water.
[00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:36.425]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:21:36.825 --> 00:21:38.966]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:44.428]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:22:29.384 --> 00:22:33.287]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:35.709]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:38.350]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:22:38.731 --> 00:22:42.353]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.

[00:22:59.702 --> 00:23:05.989]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:10.475]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[00:23:10.975 --> 00:23:18.184]  Only recently has science discovered that maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[00:23:18.724 --> 00:23:35.788]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels, increased libido, which helps prevent impotence, relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort, helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[00:23:36.088 --> 00:23:39.009]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[00:23:39.509 --> 00:23:47.697]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.

[00:24:08.927 --> 00:24:10.589]  All right, folks.
[00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:13.531]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll be taking your calls.
[00:24:13.591 --> 00:24:16.213]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:24:17.474 --> 00:24:21.538]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:22.018 --> 00:24:23.800]  Infowars has been updated today.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.763]  Paul Watson, my good buddy, who was going to be on the show, has the flu.
[00:24:28.757 --> 00:24:43.062]  But I am going to get more into that government press conference that they had that no one seemed to pay attention to that was full of the national media about Chemtrail spraying and a magnetic military pulse that was tested.
[00:24:44.042 --> 00:24:53.625]  And a lot of people that looked at the radar did see the huge magnetic pulse over the eastern seaboard right before the power outage took place.
[00:24:53.665 --> 00:24:56.086]  So we'll get more into that later today.
[00:24:56.106 --> 00:24:57.066]  And we do have the lawyer...
[00:24:58.055 --> 00:25:15.023]  For the 17 students who have filed suit against the school district on that drug raid, and now new video has been released up there at Goose Creek showing the German shepherd grabbing the back, the backpack, the shirt.
[00:25:15.544 --> 00:25:25.729]  The news says the backpack, I watched the video, it grabs the shirt too, and savagely shaking and ripping at it, jumping up on the children, the children kneeling and crying in total fear.
[00:25:26.585 --> 00:25:28.847]  I mean, that would scare me, a German Shepherd.
[00:25:28.887 --> 00:25:33.751]  I'm being told, handcuffed, kneel forward while a German Shepherd jumps on me and snaps at me.
[00:25:34.632 --> 00:25:38.154]  And they pointed guns at their heads, even more dangerous.
[00:25:38.855 --> 00:25:45.000]  Again, about two years ago, a year and a half ago, in Detroit, they shot a girl in the face in a drill.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:55.889]  A couple years ago, they shot Cop of the Year in the head and killed him in a drill with loaded guns with children in Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:25:57.461 --> 00:25:57.982]  We're good to go.
[00:26:17.232 --> 00:26:18.734]  Yeah, this is going on everywhere.
[00:26:18.774 --> 00:26:27.521]  So we got that lawyer coming on the show, and now they're reporting out of the South Carolina news, the state.
[00:26:28.282 --> 00:26:30.824]  Raid that might have broken drug dog rules.
[00:26:30.864 --> 00:26:34.547]  Video shows Goose Creek police using canines in school sweep.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:46.649]  Charleston, the Goose Creek Police Department, appears not to have followed its own rules on using drug dogs in its gun-drawn raid at Stratford High School last month.
[00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:54.835]  The videotape the police department released shows a police dog passing close by students who had been forced to kneel on the floor during the November 5th raid.
[00:26:54.855 --> 00:26:57.437]  It also captured an officer lecturing students.
[00:26:58.632 --> 00:27:01.034]  As that part of the raid ends.
[00:27:13.035 --> 00:27:13.655]  We're good to go.
[00:27:13.775 --> 00:27:14.376]  I think?
[00:27:31.946 --> 00:27:35.370]  The dog grabs a backpack with its mouth and shakes it.
[00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.272]  You know, the savage attacking.
[00:27:38.573 --> 00:27:45.140]  Another time, the dog jumps briefly on its hind legs onto his handler as they check students huddling in an alcove.
[00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:54.189]  And department procedure says that they can only search someone one at a time and that you cannot have a whole group being searched.
[00:27:55.090 --> 00:28:06.252]  In an illegal narcotics detection sweep, only after the on-scene supervisor has cleared the area of all personnel will the canine enter and conduct an illegal narcotics detection.
[00:28:06.612 --> 00:28:14.393]  So you take the clothes, the backpack off, the coats off, you do not have the dog do it while the person's dressed.
[00:28:15.013 --> 00:28:23.975]  And this was a German shepherd trained in drug detection in Czechoslovakia and trained in attack.
[00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.773]  So we have attack dogs.
[00:28:27.614 --> 00:28:40.171]  By the way, up at Heartland in Missouri, the big Christian school with a great record of reforming youth, some of the elementary students ran in fear.
[00:28:41.392 --> 00:28:47.537]  From the police dog, and it did follow one outside and grab the young, I believe she was 12 years of age, or no, she was 11.
[00:28:47.577 --> 00:28:49.478]  I guess she was middle school.
[00:28:50.078 --> 00:28:57.444]  Did grab her and drag her to the ground, and then the police threatened people to keep their mouths shut about that.
[00:28:57.544 --> 00:29:04.369]  So kind of a pastime now, cornering your children with dogs and pointing guns at them and screaming at them.
[00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:07.271]  It's all part of living in a free society.
[00:29:07.791 --> 00:29:08.872]  Stop the drugs.
[00:29:10.647 --> 00:29:15.668]  Coming up when we get back, we'll take some calls, and then we'll get into some of the really meaty news.
[00:29:15.748 --> 00:29:21.349]  Supreme Court upholds campaign finance First Amendment destruction reform.
[00:29:23.129 --> 00:29:25.890]  Also, Big Brother wants to know about your loans.
[00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.590]  Six children die in fresh U.S.
[00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:29.110]  blunder.
[00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.551]  AP reports Iraq has stopped counting civilian debt under U.S.
[00:29:32.691 --> 00:29:33.011]  orders.
[00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:37.712]  White House defends no-bid policy, and James Baker running things.
[00:29:39.126 --> 00:29:44.892]  We'll talk about folks getting prison time for defending themselves in England and implantable microchip news.
[00:29:44.972 --> 00:29:46.233]  Some new developments.
[00:29:46.574 --> 00:29:47.174]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.119 --> 00:29:52.000]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.102]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:57.746]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.229 --> 00:30:04.830]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.690]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[00:30:08.971 --> 00:30:17.812]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.
[00:30:18.152 --> 00:30:22.093]  Midas Resources offers a host of services and stands behind their products.

[00:31:01.493 --> 00:31:01.993]  We're good to go.
[00:31:02.013 --> 00:31:02.153]  I think?
[00:31:18.214 --> 00:31:20.635]  Well, I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.
[00:31:21.235 --> 00:31:24.516]  www.vacationa2z.com.
[00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:33.658]  A membership in vacationa2z.com will not only land you huge savings on air and hotel, you'll be treated to discounts of 10 to 80% on car rentals, golf, movies, and theme parks.
[00:31:33.818 --> 00:31:38.120]  How about free food at restaurants or big discounts on ski packages at top ski resorts?
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.040]  Not convinced yet?
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.881]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services, or shopping discounts?
[00:31:43.041 --> 00:31:43.502]  We're good to go.
[00:32:00.171 --> 00:32:02.692]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[00:32:02.772 --> 00:32:03.252]  Pollution.
[00:32:03.292 --> 00:32:03.572]  Pollen.
[00:32:03.612 --> 00:32:04.712]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:32:04.792 --> 00:32:05.193]  Allergies.
[00:32:05.333 --> 00:32:05.613]  Asthma.
[00:32:05.653 --> 00:32:06.233]  Probably not.
[00:32:06.353 --> 00:32:07.093]  Well, listen to this.
[00:32:07.333 --> 00:32:16.296]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[00:32:16.376 --> 00:32:17.216]  Six to ten times?
[00:32:17.236 --> 00:32:18.296]  How could that be, you ask?
[00:32:18.377 --> 00:32:18.637]  Worse.
[00:32:18.737 --> 00:32:20.057]  Think about what's inside your home.
[00:32:20.237 --> 00:32:20.897]  Hairspray.
[00:32:20.997 --> 00:32:21.497]  Chemicals.
[00:32:21.517 --> 00:32:22.498]  Does anyone smoke?
[00:32:22.518 --> 00:32:22.818]  Fumes.
[00:32:22.918 --> 00:32:24.598]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:32:25.059 --> 00:32:26.659]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:27.399]  Toxic fumes.
[00:32:27.439 --> 00:32:28.400]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:28.740]  They go...
[00:32:30.291 --> 00:32:30.811]  Into you.
[00:32:31.052 --> 00:32:31.852]  Into your children.
[00:32:31.892 --> 00:32:32.452]  Their lungs.
[00:32:32.532 --> 00:32:33.313]  Am I scaring you?
[00:32:33.633 --> 00:32:34.534]  Remember this word.
[00:32:34.934 --> 00:32:35.674]  Puritech.
[00:32:35.714 --> 00:32:37.235]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[00:32:37.295 --> 00:32:39.477]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[00:32:39.637 --> 00:32:52.204]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:53.565]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[00:32:53.585 --> 00:32:53.625]  888-491-4100.
[00:32:53.685 --> 00:32:54.706]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[00:32:54.826 --> 00:32:55.526]  Online at Puritech.com.
[00:33:05.746 --> 00:33:07.667]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.147 --> 00:33:10.969]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:13.210]  Crashing.
[00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:18.253]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:19.374 --> 00:33:22.436]  Waging war on corruption, defending liberty, resisting tyranny.
[00:33:23.176 --> 00:33:27.599]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:28.562 --> 00:33:33.703]  More and more people globally are waking up to the true horror that is the New World Order.
[00:33:33.723 --> 00:33:35.883]  Coming up here in a few minutes, we're going to go over these calls quickly.
[00:33:36.704 --> 00:33:43.085]  Dan and Greg and Jan and Ethan and Lesanne and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:43.105 --> 00:33:46.165]  Then I'll get into the latest implantable microchip news.
[00:33:46.225 --> 00:33:47.806]  I'm seeing it all over the country.
[00:33:48.786 --> 00:33:54.527]  Dozens of major newspapers every week about how, hey, they're going to be equipping the stores soon.
[00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:59.073]  To scan your hand with a microchip.
[00:34:00.454 --> 00:34:04.657]  Now remember, in 97 I said they start putting in thumb scanners to buy and sell in grocery stores.
[00:34:05.118 --> 00:34:07.219]  It's happened in thousands of stores.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.442]  And they're now pulling out the checkout lanes.
[00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:13.960]  Going to the self-serve lanes.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:18.502]  And once they've got you trained on those, they put the thumb scanners in and say, hey, you've got to do it.
[00:34:19.002 --> 00:34:20.782]  This is the stated plan.
[00:34:21.062 --> 00:34:22.463]  Then they move into microchips.
[00:34:22.743 --> 00:34:25.504]  What Sean Hannity says every child needs is you're not conservative.
[00:34:25.944 --> 00:34:27.205]  He said the liberals are against it.
[00:34:27.265 --> 00:34:28.705]  Imagine trying that psychology.
[00:34:28.945 --> 00:34:31.006]  The liberals are against the microchips.
[00:34:31.026 --> 00:34:31.986]  I actually heard him say that.
[00:34:32.467 --> 00:34:33.727]  Every child needs one.
[00:34:33.827 --> 00:34:34.627]  Every child.
[00:34:34.927 --> 00:34:36.248]  I'm going to invest in the company.
[00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.714]  You're not a conservative if you're not for communism.
[00:34:40.854 --> 00:34:43.418]  I mean, it's basically gotten down to that.
[00:34:43.458 --> 00:34:48.287]  We'll get into that news and a bunch of Iraq news here after the calls.
[00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:55.063]  I want to bring my good buddy, our big sponsor, up on the show.
[00:34:55.103 --> 00:35:08.014]  We've created a new section on InfoWars.com full of the FDA's own admissions about how the major filtering systems for municipal water supplies don't cut out cryptosporidium or E. coli.
[00:35:08.315 --> 00:35:09.236]  Did you know that?
[00:35:10.096 --> 00:35:11.077]  No, they don't.
[00:35:11.658 --> 00:35:16.102]  And it's full of the Prozac and Ritalin and birth control hormones.
[00:35:18.317 --> 00:35:18.778]  We're good to go.
[00:35:38.716 --> 00:35:41.479]  If you really love your family, folks, this is the gift for Christmas.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.822]  Force yourselves to go off the tap water.
[00:35:45.663 --> 00:35:47.725]  Jim Shepherd, thanks for coming on the show, my friend.
[00:35:47.825 --> 00:35:48.987]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[00:35:49.607 --> 00:35:57.255]  Well, you know, Alex, if you don't get enough hormones from your milk and your beef and the chicken that you eat, well, you can just supplement it with your drinking water.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.102]  It's time to filter our water, isn't it?
[00:36:00.122 --> 00:36:00.502]  It really is.
[00:36:19.148 --> 00:36:24.573]  Alex, we've got a couple Christmas specials that we want to share with folks.
[00:36:24.613 --> 00:36:25.654]  You can't say Christmas.
[00:36:25.714 --> 00:36:26.755]  It's politically incorrect.
[00:36:27.215 --> 00:36:27.575]  Oh, okay.
[00:36:27.595 --> 00:36:28.216]  Holidays.
[00:36:28.296 --> 00:36:30.058]  We may be arrested for thought crime.
[00:36:30.518 --> 00:36:31.138]  Okay.
[00:36:31.259 --> 00:36:31.639]  All right.
[00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:33.020]  Well, let's keep that straight then.
[00:36:34.341 --> 00:36:45.551]  Anyway, we have an inexpensive system that we put together for folks that just want to get something going or they want to give a good gift and not spend too much money for the kids in college or whatever.
[00:36:46.144 --> 00:36:54.346]  And that's going to be the Berkey Light with two supersized ceramic super sterile filters that do remove the pathogenic bacteria from the water.
[00:36:54.366 --> 00:36:56.346]  They also reduce the chemicals and so forth.
[00:36:56.986 --> 00:36:57.366]  Normally $199.
[00:36:58.007 --> 00:37:03.328]  If you call now, you can get those between now and Christmas for $149.
[00:37:04.268 --> 00:37:06.928]  By the way, Jim, that's the best deal I've ever heard you offer.
[00:37:07.488 --> 00:37:14.530]  Well, and the thing is that folks need to get their call in soon if they want to get that to folks, to their relatives.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:23.784]  Before Christmas, and for people that, you know, if you live in one state and your relatives live in another state, we can drop ship that to your relative.
[00:37:23.924 --> 00:37:28.646]  Yeah, by the way, you know, I ship my videos out regular mail, takes a week or two.
[00:37:29.066 --> 00:37:36.049]  You ship the day you get the order or the day after, UPS, and every time I've ordered from you, I get it in three or four days.
[00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.769]  That's right.
[00:37:36.989 --> 00:37:40.011]  Yeah, we try to get them out the door right away.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:48.241]  And, Alex, and then we also have had a lot of requests for that October special, so we decided to go ahead and run that back up again.
[00:37:48.261 --> 00:37:50.342]  Now, we have some other specials on your website.
[00:37:50.422 --> 00:37:54.822]  If folks go to that and go down and look for the Berkey Light specials.
[00:37:55.162 --> 00:37:59.003]  And we have right there, we have Yahoo!
[00:37:59.023 --> 00:38:05.464]  Shopping Cart, Great Security, and those orders every day are gotten by Debbie at New Millennium, and they go out.
[00:38:05.584 --> 00:38:07.204]  So great service through these folks.
[00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:10.005]  And so we have a number of specials for, you know,
[00:38:10.464 --> 00:38:15.386]  Package deals, if you want to get a bunch of people to sport bottles, whatever we have, quantity discounts.
[00:38:16.246 --> 00:38:17.947]  But we're going to extend the October special.
[00:38:17.967 --> 00:38:21.108]  Now, this will not be posted on the website, so you need to pay attention to it.
[00:38:21.649 --> 00:38:24.330]  And then call in, tell them you want the October special.
[00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:26.391]  We're going to extend it here for about two weeks.
[00:38:27.351 --> 00:38:30.932]  And it's the Berkey light with the lights.
[00:38:30.972 --> 00:38:32.973]  You can choose red or blue lights.
[00:38:33.473 --> 00:38:34.834]  You get also the solar lights.
[00:38:35.522 --> 00:38:41.866]  Uh, recharger with that that can also be used to recharge your cell phones and radios in an emergency or a blackout.
[00:38:42.506 --> 00:38:48.670]  Also get the KDF shower filter to take that stuff, uh, the chemicals out of your, uh, shower so you don't breathe them in.
[00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:57.315]  We also have the battery adapter, uh, included in that, uh, and that will run the Berkey Light lights, which are bright enough to light up a whole room.
[00:38:57.355 --> 00:38:58.436]  You can see them a mile away.
[00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:03.759]  And, uh, on four, uh, alkaline batteries, you can run it for two weeks, uh, every night.
[00:39:04.545 --> 00:39:10.669]  And then we have two sport bottles or two potassium iodate, or you can mix and match, get one of each.
[00:39:11.189 --> 00:39:14.612]  That's a $471 value for $383.
[00:39:15.652 --> 00:39:21.316]  Basically, we're going to take care of all of your water needs, plus if you get the potassium iodate, you're going to take care of your nuclear needs.
[00:39:22.137 --> 00:39:32.844]  The second special is going to be if you've got a stainless steel system and you want to upgrade from the ceramic to the black Berkey filter elements, you've got four black Berkey purification elements.
[00:39:33.798 --> 00:39:37.381]  And the shower filter or a sport burqa.
[00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:39.502]  You can choose whichever one you want.
[00:39:39.582 --> 00:39:45.066]  That's normally $2.41, and the special price is $1.92 on that.
[00:39:45.086 --> 00:39:48.309]  So you can save about $50 on that package.
[00:39:49.209 --> 00:39:49.890]  All right, folks.
[00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.971]  Debbie's there right now to take your call.
[00:39:52.032 --> 00:39:53.493]  The toll-free number to call is...
[00:39:54.445 --> 00:39:54.725]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:39:54.745 --> 00:39:54.805]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:39:54.825 --> 00:39:59.808]  If you call and it's busy, leave your name and number, she'll call you right back today.
[00:39:59.828 --> 00:39:59.948]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:40:00.409 --> 00:40:04.171]  And we have a lot of those specials listed at Infowars.com.
[00:40:16.158 --> 00:40:16.318]  Well, the...
[00:40:40.861 --> 00:40:41.602]  I don't know which.
[00:40:41.882 --> 00:40:49.968]  No, this is if you've got a stainless steel system, and it can be either one of our own or if you've bought one from another company.
[00:40:49.988 --> 00:40:51.869]  No, no, I was going back to the first special you mentioned.
[00:40:52.429 --> 00:40:54.971]  Oh, that's the Berkey light with the lights.
[00:40:56.386 --> 00:40:59.728]  You get the Berkey light with the lights, and you can pick white or blue.
[00:40:59.889 --> 00:41:01.069]  White is great for camping.
[00:41:01.089 --> 00:41:02.030]  They're great for emergency.
[00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.731]  Blue is just plain beautiful.
[00:41:03.831 --> 00:41:07.114]  No, I mean the special before that one that was like 140 or something.
[00:41:07.454 --> 00:41:10.996]  Okay, no, that's the four black Berkey purification elements.
[00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:17.761]  If you've got a stainless steel system and you've got the ceramic filters and you want to upgrade them to the purification elements,
[00:41:18.547 --> 00:41:21.229]  Then you can get four Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:41:21.289 --> 00:41:23.090]  You know, Jim, I'm sorry I'm confusing you here.
[00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:29.615]  The first special you mentioned with the Super Sterizil filters.
[00:41:29.755 --> 00:41:33.217]  Okay, now what that is, excuse me, that is a Berkey light.
[00:41:33.818 --> 00:41:35.439]  It has the transparent chambers.
[00:41:36.179 --> 00:41:41.163]  And then we're going to put two Imperial Super Sterizil filters in there.
[00:41:41.743 --> 00:41:45.106]  They're 50% larger than the standard filters.
[00:41:45.306 --> 00:41:46.927]  How many gallons a day will that do?
[00:41:47.429 --> 00:41:58.113]  Oh, that's going to do about 25 to 30 gallons a day, and it normally would be $1.99, and we are going to do that for $1.49 between now and Christmas.
[00:41:58.313 --> 00:42:00.834]  All right, 1-888-803-4438.
[00:42:01.774 --> 00:42:03.454]  Jim, thanks for coming on.
[00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:04.235]  Always a pleasure.
[00:42:04.275 --> 00:42:05.275]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[00:42:05.335 --> 00:42:05.655]  You bet.
[00:42:05.675 --> 00:42:06.495]  I really appreciate it.
[00:42:06.515 --> 00:42:13.958]  They're great folks, great prices, and they pay for the entire six hours a day global shortwave serving the planet.
[00:42:14.418 --> 00:42:20.443]  And folks, we've got listeners by the thousands that we know of in Africa, in Asia, in Europe, in England.
[00:42:21.204 --> 00:42:25.587]  Just an incredible outreach, six hours a day, two different bands of shortwave.
[00:42:26.328 --> 00:42:27.328]  Just wonderful folks.
[00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:29.430]  Okay, let's go to the calls.
[00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:31.952]  Thanks for holding, folks, and more of the news coming up.
[00:42:32.612 --> 00:42:33.793]  Thanks for bearing with us on that.
[00:42:34.314 --> 00:42:40.659]  Let's talk to Dan in Illinois, then Greg, Jan, and Ethan, and Lesanne and others.
[00:42:40.879 --> 00:42:41.720]  Dan, you're on the air.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.140]  Go ahead.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:42.900]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:43.441]  Good, sir.
[00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:48.692]  You know, I'm a little confused about what all the protesting against Mel Gibson's film or anything else like that.
[00:42:49.012 --> 00:42:51.112]  Well, it doesn't work when they show it.
[00:42:51.152 --> 00:42:54.514]  Mel Gibson was here Sunday, showed it to all the liberals, and they loved it.
[00:42:54.574 --> 00:42:56.594]  So it kind of blew up in the ADL's face.
[00:42:56.955 --> 00:42:57.755]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:42:58.415 --> 00:43:01.036]  Christians, by their existence, believe that Christ is God.
[00:43:02.537 --> 00:43:06.758]  Jewish people, by their fact that they remain Jewish, says that he wasn't.
[00:43:07.538 --> 00:43:09.459]  So if he wasn't God, he was a blasphemer like...
[00:43:10.542 --> 00:43:11.363]  It says in the Bible.
[00:43:11.463 --> 00:43:18.470]  Well, the leftists don't like Christians and Christianity, period, and they'll attack anything Christian.
[00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:19.491]  Look at the Ten Commandments.
[00:43:20.311 --> 00:43:23.134]  I mean, is this truly a leftist thing, or is it more of a Jewish thing?
[00:43:24.426 --> 00:43:27.648]  Well, there are a lot of Jews who are Christians.
[00:43:28.888 --> 00:43:38.374]  Certainly, I mean, a big part of the liberal movement that doesn't like Christianity has Jewish organizations in it, but there's Buddhists who don't like Christians, there's Muslims who don't like Christians.
[00:43:38.954 --> 00:43:41.175]  I mean, religions are always fighting with each other.
[00:43:41.575 --> 00:43:43.997]  I mean, I meant the people who remain Jewish.
[00:43:44.057 --> 00:43:49.820]  I mean, it seems more of a pressure like that to me because it's making them supposedly look bad when actually it doesn't.
[00:43:50.584 --> 00:43:51.545]  To their own religion.
[00:43:51.565 --> 00:43:57.608]  Well, I know the ADL came out against Judge Moore, but so did the Southern Poverty Law Center and a bunch of others.
[00:43:57.688 --> 00:44:04.753]  But, yes, that particular group is always going after Christians, and it's wrong.
[00:44:05.453 --> 00:44:09.956]  And I don't know why, because the Ten Commandments were given to Moses.
[00:44:10.576 --> 00:44:13.858]  So that's Jewish and Christian.
[00:44:13.918 --> 00:44:15.759]  So it's crazy.
[00:44:15.979 --> 00:44:19.982]  Isn't the Anti-Affirmation League, whatever that's called, aren't they against this movie, too?
[00:44:20.675 --> 00:44:26.916]  Oh, they have called Mel Gibson an anti-Semite, which is slander, which is just total garbage.
[00:44:27.196 --> 00:44:29.317]  That's like the thing I'm talking about.
[00:44:29.337 --> 00:44:30.557]  I mean, why since?
[00:44:31.237 --> 00:44:37.759]  If they think they're correct in their position and their belief system, this movie just shows their position.
[00:44:37.979 --> 00:44:47.200]  Well, in the article I wrote about Arnold Schwarzenegger during the election, before he was elected, I point out that in 1978, in a banquet hall with over 1,000 people in it,
[00:44:50.214 --> 00:44:54.996]  He said, I hate all inward, inward, inward, get out subhuman blacks.
[00:44:55.436 --> 00:45:02.439]  This is from thousands of witnesses, 200 bodybuilders, throwing a fit because he dropped out that year because this black guy was bigger than him.
[00:45:03.259 --> 00:45:06.620]  And he had to have a rest from the roids.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:07.561]  That's been in the news.
[00:45:08.166 --> 00:45:09.447]  I mean, it just doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:45:09.467 --> 00:45:14.390]  Well, it makes a lot of sense if you understand it's a political tool to attack anybody that's wholesome.
[00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:16.031]  Well, I mean, you know, I'm being facetious.
[00:45:16.071 --> 00:45:16.932]  I do understand that.
[00:45:37.372 --> 00:45:40.053]  We don't want anything to make them look bad, and that's all there is to it.
[00:45:41.134 --> 00:45:42.314]  And it's like that.
[00:45:42.354 --> 00:45:43.455]  You talk about censorship.
[00:45:43.475 --> 00:45:44.816]  You talk about First Amendment.
[00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:47.537]  A movie has to be the... Well, it's not going to work.
[00:45:47.577 --> 00:45:52.779]  Mel Gibson's going all over the country showing the passion, and people are getting a chance to see it.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.861]  And the writer for the statement said, I don't get the big deal.
[00:45:57.642 --> 00:46:03.204]  This is the version of the movie that didn't cut the stuff out that the ADL doesn't like, and there's nothing in it bad.
[00:46:03.264 --> 00:46:04.705]  I mean, it's just the Bible.
[00:46:04.965 --> 00:46:05.825]  It's what happened.
[00:46:06.186 --> 00:46:06.746]  Is it in Arabic?
[00:46:07.675 --> 00:46:08.636]  Yes.
[00:46:08.656 --> 00:46:10.577]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[00:46:10.597 --> 00:46:11.337]  I appreciate it.
[00:46:11.798 --> 00:46:12.638]  I appreciate your call.
[00:46:13.259 --> 00:46:18.322]  Let's go ahead and talk to Greg in North Carolina.
[00:46:18.362 --> 00:46:19.042]  Go ahead, Greg.
[00:46:19.402 --> 00:46:20.203]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:46:20.223 --> 00:46:20.683]  How are you?
[00:46:20.703 --> 00:46:33.811]  I was just wondering, since the spring of 2001 in my little area here in western North Carolina, we had quite a bit of weird airplane traffic, and it started with a little airplane, single engine, that was marked Chinese.
[00:46:35.182 --> 00:46:36.944]  I just wonder what your take would be on that.
[00:46:37.364 --> 00:46:37.845]  I don't know.
[00:46:37.885 --> 00:46:38.966]  I don't have enough information.
[00:46:39.006 --> 00:46:42.670]  But I know that Chinese troops are at a lot of major U.S.
[00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:50.999]  bases, have been given entrance into secure areas that citizens can't see, into NORAD, you name it, into NORTHCOM, you name it.
[00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:54.763]  And it's horrible, and we do have foreign troops there.
[00:46:54.803 --> 00:46:55.704]  That's mainstream news.
[00:46:56.272 --> 00:46:59.433]  This is like a signal engine type Cessna type plane.
[00:46:59.674 --> 00:47:06.717]  Well, a lot of, look, I mean, we've seen Russian planes, Czechoslovakian, Hungarian, Ukrainian flying around Austin.
[00:47:06.737 --> 00:47:12.279]  We'll drive out to the airport, and it's some, you know, rich lawyer who bought one for 50 grand.
[00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:16.761]  So a lot of times when you see foreign aircraft and stuff, people bought it.
[00:47:17.181 --> 00:47:21.043]  And they can still leave the country markings on it and not change it to an N for America?
[00:47:21.947 --> 00:47:27.270]  I believe that if it doesn't have proper numbers, it's a violation of FAA rules.
[00:47:27.931 --> 00:47:31.113]  Okay, well, I'm talking about, you know, American is in before the numbers.
[00:47:31.753 --> 00:47:35.035]  This one had a B before the numbers, and I called the FAA, and that's China.
[00:47:35.555 --> 00:47:37.997]  Yes, I know that the lawyers around here...
[00:47:39.399 --> 00:47:44.762]  I just happen to know two lawyers that we've pulled up and questioned them.
[00:47:45.463 --> 00:47:46.863]  They don't take the markings off.
[00:47:46.904 --> 00:47:50.106]  They leave the foreign markings and then add U.S.
[00:47:50.146 --> 00:47:50.626]  markings.
[00:47:51.467 --> 00:47:58.111]  But, I mean, if you call the FAA, how many of these single-engine Chinese planes have you seen?
[00:47:58.666 --> 00:48:05.691]  We only had one who was buzzing everybody's house at low altitude, doing circles, and cutting his motor off, you know, coasting over people's houses.
[00:48:05.711 --> 00:48:09.733]  Well, there's the Open Skies Treaty that any foreign plane that wants to can fly over us.
[00:48:09.974 --> 00:48:11.154]  So, I don't know.
[00:48:11.174 --> 00:48:18.139]  Well, he was below the 500 feet, though, which is where they're supposed to be away from a person's house or building or automobile.
[00:48:18.759 --> 00:48:19.260]  I don't know.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.541]  I don't know what to say, Greg.
[00:48:21.281 --> 00:48:25.284]  Okay, I'll just get me a better camera and start taking pictures for the FAA, I guess.
[00:48:25.464 --> 00:48:26.885]  I think that's a good idea, yes.
[00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:28.931]  Thanks for the call.
[00:48:29.612 --> 00:48:30.192]  I appreciate it.
[00:48:30.232 --> 00:48:31.252]  Sorry, I can't answer your question.
[00:48:31.272 --> 00:48:33.013]  I just don't have enough info.
[00:48:33.073 --> 00:48:34.553]  Interesting question, though.
[00:48:35.014 --> 00:48:37.274]  Jan in Colorado, you're on the air.
[00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:37.835]  Thanks for holding.
[00:48:37.875 --> 00:48:38.175]  Go ahead.
[00:48:38.575 --> 00:48:39.455]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[00:48:39.915 --> 00:48:42.937]  I just wanted to say I loved your video, Bohemian Grove.
[00:48:43.077 --> 00:48:45.398]  I think everybody needs to see that.
[00:48:46.038 --> 00:48:46.978]  It was excellent.
[00:48:48.179 --> 00:48:56.862]  Well, for those that don't know what Bohemian Grove is and that George Bush admittedly attends, so did his daddy and his daddy and his daddy, why don't you tell folks what you saw in the video?
[00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:03.853]  Well, it was them having their ceremonies and important people in government.
[00:49:04.693 --> 00:49:09.795]  And it just showed what really goes on in some of these secret societies.
[00:49:10.075 --> 00:49:11.456]  And I think it's an eye-opener.
[00:49:11.536 --> 00:49:13.677]  Everyone needs to be informed.
[00:49:14.878 --> 00:49:18.859]  And I wanted to go into something else that I think is kind of interesting.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.461]  And I want to know if you've heard anything about this.
[00:49:22.181 --> 00:49:25.642]  Someone told us, someone in Washington, D.C., that
[00:49:27.682 --> 00:49:28.423]  I know that most elite...
[00:49:37.392 --> 00:49:38.373]  And she divorced her husband.
[00:50:07.242 --> 00:50:07.723]  Ted Turner?
[00:50:08.424 --> 00:50:09.405]  Yeah, uh-huh.
[00:50:09.505 --> 00:50:16.055]  And there was an article in the Christian Science Monitor two weeks ago about the mass evacuation that's taking place.
[00:50:16.916 --> 00:50:21.062]  Do you think maybe they have planned a terrorist attack someplace close to Washington, D.C.?
[00:50:21.122 --> 00:50:23.105]  Is that what's on the books?
[00:50:24.159 --> 00:50:30.424]  I think unless we expose that they stand against from terror, they're going to release smallpox or some other horrible thing.
[00:50:30.725 --> 00:50:34.528]  They've made preparations as the smoke screen for a total federal takeover.
[00:50:35.189 --> 00:50:37.230]  That'll be their excuse for a total clampdown.
[00:50:37.531 --> 00:50:38.752]  They've said they're going to do it.
[00:50:39.716 --> 00:50:40.857]  They've said it's going to happen.
[00:50:40.877 --> 00:50:42.819]  We're going to save you by enslaving you.
[00:50:43.139 --> 00:50:46.443]  So, yes, I think it's going to happen unless we get the word out.
[00:50:46.563 --> 00:50:48.965]  We are in a life-or-death situation.
[00:50:49.185 --> 00:50:55.872]  We're all standing in the crosshairs of history, folks, and we are on the edge of the death of America.
[00:50:55.952 --> 00:50:56.392]  Stay there.
[00:50:56.492 --> 00:50:57.934]  We'll talk more on the other side, Jan.
[00:51:01.071 --> 00:51:06.975]  Oh my... I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:51:07.135 --> 00:51:07.775]  Yes, it's true.
[00:51:07.795 --> 00:51:10.517]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:51:10.637 --> 00:51:14.640]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.300]  You heard it right.
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:20.423]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:51:20.503 --> 00:51:21.544]  The list goes on and on.
[00:51:21.804 --> 00:51:22.745]  You may miss out forever.
[00:51:38.712 --> 00:51:39.253]  We're good to go.
[00:52:02.196 --> 00:52:06.718]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:07.058 --> 00:52:11.160]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.000]  We listened.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:17.282]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:17.562 --> 00:52:18.043]  We listened.
[00:52:18.423 --> 00:52:21.484]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:21.884 --> 00:52:22.424]  We listened.
[00:52:22.885 --> 00:52:26.046]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.461]  We're good to go.
[00:52:52.875 --> 00:52:53.758]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.778 --> 00:52:55.224]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:00.552 --> 00:53:07.374]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:53:07.694 --> 00:53:09.075]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:53:09.275 --> 00:53:11.475]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:53:11.635 --> 00:53:13.716]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:53:13.996 --> 00:53:18.938]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:53:19.258 --> 00:53:23.299]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:53:23.559 --> 00:53:24.139]  We're good to go.
[00:53:47.268 --> 00:53:51.130]  That's 888-253-3139 or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.951]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:53:52.071 --> 00:53:53.732]  All right, going back to Jan in Colorado.
[00:53:53.752 --> 00:53:54.973]  She had asked why that
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.801]  She's heard about this evacuation out of D.C.
[00:54:16.821 --> 00:54:17.621]  and other areas.
[00:54:19.182 --> 00:54:24.304]  They're moving in Congress with a CFR commission study trying to implement it into law.
[00:54:24.344 --> 00:54:29.606]  They have a CONCON, which is a terrifying thing, a constitutional convention.
[00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:36.649]  And if they can get a CONCON going under the name of flag-burning ban or something that a lot of folks would agree with,
[00:54:38.695 --> 00:54:43.297]  Then when it's in that process, they can rewrite the whole Constitution, the whole Bill of Rights.
[00:54:43.858 --> 00:54:51.501]  Well, their new reason for a con-con is an emergency procedure to appoint new members of Congress if a third of them are killed, a third or more.
[00:54:53.102 --> 00:54:56.524]  And the president with the state governors would then appoint the people.
[00:54:58.166 --> 00:54:59.887]  And so they are making all these preparations.
[00:54:59.927 --> 00:55:02.828]  The New York Times on Monday had the article about SARS.
[00:55:02.888 --> 00:55:04.309]  Well, it's going to be an outbreak.
[00:55:04.369 --> 00:55:05.449]  It's going to happen.
[00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:12.112]  We've got quarantines with armed police in every city and town now, and the feds are running it.
[00:55:12.792 --> 00:55:14.633]  And so this is really going on.
[00:55:14.673 --> 00:55:18.975]  And then we've got the different generals and people saying, well, it's for your own good.
[00:55:19.035 --> 00:55:24.817]  It's kind of sad, but we'll have to set aside the Constitution for a military form of government to keep you safe.
[00:55:25.618 --> 00:55:31.585]  Creating that false perception that military government is a good thing and, well, it's what happens if we're attacked again.
[00:55:32.506 --> 00:55:36.851]  And so they're setting that psychological precedent.
[00:55:36.931 --> 00:55:37.852]  Anything else, Jan?
[00:55:39.414 --> 00:55:44.600]  What else I heard was that most people would be safe in, say, the mountainous areas.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.262]  Have you heard anything about that?
[00:55:48.351 --> 00:55:49.592]  Well, I mean safe.
[00:55:49.732 --> 00:56:10.741]  If there is a major biological outbreak that's in your area, if you can get out to a rural area and isolate yourself until the hysteria and the rioting, which will tend to be worse than the disease itself, and then the secondary federal takeover, quote, answering that crisis, then yes, you would be safer.
[00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:13.142]  Okay.
[00:56:14.824 --> 00:56:16.384]  I appreciate your call, Jim.
[00:56:16.404 --> 00:56:17.404]  Yeah, thank you so much.
[00:56:17.485 --> 00:56:18.225]  You're doing a good job.
[00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:19.625]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[00:56:20.245 --> 00:56:22.565]  Let's talk to Ethan in California.
[00:56:22.605 --> 00:56:23.246]  You're on the air.
[00:56:23.326 --> 00:56:23.666]  Go ahead.
[00:56:23.706 --> 00:56:25.026]  Hey, how are you doing today, Alex?
[00:56:25.086 --> 00:56:25.786]  Fantastic, sir.
[00:56:25.826 --> 00:56:26.506]  I love your show.
[00:56:26.546 --> 00:56:28.346]  I just saw They Live last night.
[00:56:28.406 --> 00:56:32.347]  I wish I could go out to Houston to see your show, but I won't be able to make it.
[00:56:32.367 --> 00:56:33.047]  I was trying to.
[00:56:33.207 --> 00:56:34.128]  It was a great movie.
[00:56:34.788 --> 00:56:35.668]  Really fantastic.
[00:56:36.228 --> 00:56:42.349]  Also, I just wanted to thank you a lot, because I noticed you always say, you know, you do the truth and the facts, and you said the thing about the death camps this morning.
[00:56:42.941 --> 00:56:47.823]  And that one kind of blew my mind, but I just went online and read about it, and that's some really crazy stuff.
[00:56:48.503 --> 00:56:54.044]  Yeah, we have a whole section where they have mass graves and center raiders ready for you and your family.
[00:56:54.084 --> 00:56:56.525]  That's the Colorado news there.
[00:56:56.545 --> 00:56:56.945]  Completely.
[00:56:56.985 --> 00:56:57.966]  I looked that up, too.
[00:56:57.986 --> 00:56:59.846]  You know, my friends think I'm crazy listening to you.
[00:56:59.886 --> 00:57:00.947]  I'm telling them about this stuff.
[00:57:00.987 --> 00:57:02.587]  I'm looking at mainstream media news.
[00:57:02.987 --> 00:57:06.108]  You know, it's all about the truth, and they really think, like, why are you questioning the government?
[00:57:06.148 --> 00:57:07.769]  You know, like, everything's okay.
[00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:11.950]  Just take your pills and... And see, that's what's so scary is that they're floating it
[00:57:12.979 --> 00:57:14.680]  Oh, we may have to put you in a camp.
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.501]  We may have to burn your body.
[00:57:16.581 --> 00:57:18.982]  We may have to... But it's for your safety.
[00:57:19.082 --> 00:57:19.603]  Oh, definitely.
[00:57:19.663 --> 00:57:21.323]  I'm looking at escape routes out of L.A.
[00:57:21.383 --> 00:57:23.464]  I took my girlfriend out of town just through the mountains.
[00:57:23.484 --> 00:57:25.826]  I've been talking about getting us backpacks and hiking gear.
[00:57:25.846 --> 00:57:27.667]  And she's looking at me like I'm crazy.
[00:57:27.707 --> 00:57:28.607]  Like, why would you need this?
[00:57:28.727 --> 00:57:33.049]  And I'm like... Well, if we don't stop the globalists and expose them, you will need it.
[00:57:33.169 --> 00:57:35.671]  The government is saying this is going to happen.
[00:57:35.971 --> 00:57:38.792]  We're trying to expose them so they don't move.
[00:57:39.433 --> 00:57:40.133]  Again, folks...
[00:57:41.116 --> 00:57:47.798]  I mean, we're living in the most dangerous and most interesting times ever in human history right now.
[00:57:47.878 --> 00:57:49.258]  This is life or death.
[00:57:49.578 --> 00:57:51.278]  We are standing on the edge.
[00:57:51.699 --> 00:57:52.319]  Most definitely.
[00:57:52.379 --> 00:57:59.160]  Also, I keep a picture of John Ashcroft up in my office, based on how you were saying about the reports of college students and people just knowing their government.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.441]  Most people have no clue who he is.
[00:58:01.601 --> 00:58:02.181]  I can't believe it.
[00:58:02.759 --> 00:58:06.403]  I keep a nice picture of the one from his website with him by the flag, smiling.
[00:58:06.864 --> 00:58:07.885]  And nobody gets it.
[00:58:07.925 --> 00:58:08.546]  I can't believe it.
[00:58:09.206 --> 00:58:12.911]  One out of 14, maybe one out of seven, really see who he is.
[00:58:12.931 --> 00:58:16.715]  And that just really blows my mind, because there's all these things, too, about these flu shots.
[00:58:16.775 --> 00:58:20.359]  And you're right about, I think there is going to be some sort of biological or SARS.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:23.623]  It's not a question of if, it's a question of when.
[00:58:24.326 --> 00:58:26.708]  Well, that's what the globalists are saying, absolutely.
[00:58:26.748 --> 00:58:30.011]  Just try to turn your friends on to the show, get them to listen.
[00:58:30.331 --> 00:58:30.952]  Most definitely.
[00:58:30.992 --> 00:58:32.794]  And hopefully wake folks up.
[00:58:32.834 --> 00:58:33.875]  Anything else, Ethan?
[00:58:34.115 --> 00:58:38.979]  Other than that, I love your show, and I think it's fantastic, and I'm here to fight with you, and God bless.
[00:58:39.179 --> 00:58:39.740]  You're awesome.
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:40.380]  Thank you, sir.
[00:58:41.441 --> 00:58:43.163]  Yeah, we can back them off.
[00:58:43.183 --> 00:58:47.327]  If enough people wake up, the globalists will have to suspend their plans.
[00:58:47.687 --> 00:58:49.789]  Second hour, more calls and guests coming up.
[00:58:51.397 --> 00:59:00.021]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:59:00.242 --> 00:59:11.507]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:59:11.727 --> 00:59:14.389]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:14.729 --> 00:59:18.811]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:59:18.951 --> 00:59:19.491]  We're good to go.
[00:59:42.401 --> 00:59:43.302]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[00:59:43.562 --> 00:59:44.323]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:01.824]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.484 --> 01:00:03.305]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.065 --> 01:00:04.965]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:04.985 --> 01:00:09.288]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.808 --> 01:00:13.930]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.173 --> 01:00:25.156]  All right, folks, you're now into the second hour of this global transmission.
[01:00:26.157 --> 01:00:28.438]  It is the 10th day of December 2003 on this Wednesday.
[01:00:30.757 --> 01:00:43.301]  And we're about to go to Lesanne and John and Lou and Kenneth and Matt and many, many others that are patiently holding in this second hour.
[01:00:43.821 --> 01:00:51.583]  In the third hour, coming up here in about 59 minutes, we're going to have the lawyer on who's suing the government.
[01:00:52.703 --> 01:00:55.084]  17 students filed suit over school drug raid.
[01:00:55.104 --> 01:00:57.965]  Remember that up in Goose Creek in the Carolinas?
[01:00:58.565 --> 01:00:59.446]  The video cameras?
[01:00:59.466 --> 01:01:04.008]  Well, new videos come out with the police dog grabbing backpacks, savaging them.
[01:01:04.848 --> 01:01:07.890]  It was a drug dog also trained in attack, a German shepherd.
[01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:10.351]  This is the new America.
[01:01:11.351 --> 01:01:12.892]  Of course, no drugs were found.
[01:01:13.672 --> 01:01:15.793]  And they put guns to the children's heads as well.
[01:01:16.434 --> 01:01:20.736]  That's coming up as we expose police state USA.
[01:01:21.376 --> 01:01:24.197]  Also, Supreme Court upholds political money law.
[01:01:24.277 --> 01:01:25.098]  We'll get to that.
[01:01:26.211 --> 01:01:28.692]  One alone, Big Brother's watching also.
[01:01:29.312 --> 01:01:34.194]  Iraq's been told, the puppet government, not to report any dead Iraqi civilians.
[01:01:35.214 --> 01:01:40.535]  And we'll talk about Bush and what's happening with Taiwan, telling them that they're slaves of China, basically.
[01:01:41.076 --> 01:01:46.297]  And Verichip and stores, get ready to start swiping your arm to buy and sell.
[01:01:47.217 --> 01:01:50.058]  Right now, let's go to Lesanne in New York.
[01:01:50.198 --> 01:01:51.859]  Lesanne, you're on the air.
[01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:52.359]  Welcome.
[01:01:53.207 --> 01:01:53.968]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:54.688 --> 01:01:56.029]  Let's hope this works this time.
[01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:57.631]  It's my first time calling.
[01:01:57.651 --> 01:01:59.732]  I'm going to make a very quick comment.
[01:02:01.814 --> 01:02:04.596]  First of all, I bless you for what you're doing.
[01:02:04.616 --> 01:02:09.860]  It's actually a comfort as alarming and stunning as the news is.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:16.365]  It's a comfort for me because I feel very isolated and I feel very alone.
[01:02:16.385 --> 01:02:19.027]  I live in New York in a very metropolitan area.
[01:02:19.047 --> 01:02:22.229]  I know there are other individuals scattered about, but
[01:02:22.668 --> 01:02:24.429]  They're the truth-seekers, like I am.
[01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:33.757]  But I'm also a Christian, and I no longer even attend services because I can't stomach what I'm seeing around me.
[01:02:36.679 --> 01:02:41.003]  One of the churches is saying, worship Bush, worship world government.
[01:02:41.143 --> 01:02:43.765]  Well, if you read between the lines, yes.
[01:02:43.965 --> 01:02:50.230]  I would say that what I would say the church is, I'd call it like counterfeit Christianity.
[01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:50.310]  And...
[01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:58.091]  You know, they're concerned with a need to maintain the comfort level of people.
[01:02:58.111 --> 01:03:03.112]  You know, to keep their numbers high and to build and make their buildings bigger.
[01:03:03.132 --> 01:03:04.733]  To tickle their ears.
[01:03:05.853 --> 01:03:07.053]  I can't stomach it.
[01:03:07.594 --> 01:03:18.416]  And I know that I've been criticized by some individuals that are true Christians that are also aware of the truth that I need to not focus on those things.
[01:03:18.496 --> 01:03:21.597]  But there's something inside of me that just wants to literally...
[01:03:22.762 --> 01:03:26.864]  You know, I get very angry, and I appreciate you as a person.
[01:03:26.884 --> 01:03:32.707]  I just, you know, probably nobody's really said this to you, but you have, like, this passion, and I'm very passionate.
[01:03:33.248 --> 01:03:42.973]  And because of your passion, I've even got my daughter to listen to you, and, you know, who's basically got a teenage mentality, but because she's me, and just in that passion part.
[01:03:43.973 --> 01:03:49.196]  I wish I could remember all the facts and the, you know, news articles that you have, but I do have, like, folders galore.
[01:03:49.396 --> 01:03:51.077]  Well, let me say this, Lesanne.
[01:03:52.353 --> 01:03:57.356]  Anybody that tells you you shouldn't be upset or passionate about the evil has a problem.
[01:03:57.416 --> 01:04:10.685]  I mean, Christ whipped the money changers for their activities, and we're supposed to get mad at evil and to speak out against it.
[01:04:11.205 --> 01:04:12.386]  And that's a good thing.
[01:04:12.746 --> 01:04:19.911]  I agree with you, but you're doing it, and you're doing it in spite of what untold consequences might happen next.
[01:04:20.749 --> 01:04:22.250]  You know, I pray for you.
[01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:22.930]  I pray for me.
[01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.091]  Well, duties, mind, and consequences are God's.
[01:04:25.851 --> 01:04:32.574]  Exactly, and I just wanted to say one more thing, you know, on that, you know, one of the scriptures in the Bible.
[01:04:32.774 --> 01:04:33.114]  Say what?
[01:04:33.154 --> 01:04:33.955]  Stay there, Lysanne.
[01:04:33.975 --> 01:04:37.016]  I'll let you cover more of this when we get back, okay?
[01:04:37.896 --> 01:04:38.837]  I'll put you on hold.
[01:04:39.577 --> 01:04:40.117]  Don't hang up.
[01:04:40.157 --> 01:04:45.980]  We'll let you finish up, and then we'll real quick get to John and Lou and Kenneth and Matt and others.
[01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:50.514]  We'll be right back, and I'm going to jump into this news as well.
[01:04:50.534 --> 01:04:57.540]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:02.164]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:02.324 --> 01:05:06.708]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:05:06.748 --> 01:05:08.070]  The New World Order...
[01:05:09.856 --> 01:05:14.082]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:14.142 --> 01:05:21.070]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:23.213]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.601 --> 01:05:33.925]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.205 --> 01:05:39.548]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:05:40.088 --> 01:05:42.709]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[01:05:44.249 --> 01:05:44.470]  That's 888.
[01:05:52.914 --> 01:05:55.816]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[01:05:55.836 --> 01:05:57.837]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[01:05:57.997 --> 01:06:03.621]  CheaperHotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCar.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.
[01:06:03.721 --> 01:06:09.485]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.
[01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:12.066]  Well, I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.
[01:06:12.666 --> 01:06:15.927]  www.vacationa2z.com.

[01:06:25.271 --> 01:06:29.532]  How about free food at restaurants or big discounts on ski packages at top ski resorts?
[01:06:29.772 --> 01:06:30.453]  Not convinced yet?
[01:06:30.613 --> 01:06:34.314]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services, or shopping discounts?
[01:06:34.474 --> 01:06:34.914]  We're good to go.
[01:06:51.673 --> 01:06:52.253]  Hello, folks.
[01:06:52.294 --> 01:06:53.254]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:53.655 --> 01:06:59.379]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:06:59.639 --> 01:07:04.763]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:14.431]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:07:14.751 --> 01:07:19.695]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:07:20.015 --> 01:07:24.021]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:07:24.221 --> 01:07:29.009]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:07:29.369 --> 01:07:35.278]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:07:47.047 --> 01:07:50.029]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:07:54.172 --> 01:08:00.216]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:00.817 --> 01:08:03.799]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:05.203 --> 01:08:09.285]  All right, folks, 8 minutes and 15 seconds into this second hour.
[01:08:11.607 --> 01:08:13.628]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:08:13.688 --> 01:08:16.069]  Let's talk to John in Colorado.
[01:08:16.109 --> 01:08:16.870]  John, welcome.
[01:08:18.771 --> 01:08:19.771]  Good to talk to you, John.
[01:08:21.632 --> 01:08:22.073]  Okay.
[01:08:22.233 --> 01:08:22.673]  Can you hear me?
[01:08:23.113 --> 01:08:23.914]  Yes, I can hear you.
[01:08:23.934 --> 01:08:31.598]  Okay, very quickly, I'm talking about this treatment as it pertains to describing and defining one's own status in society.
[01:08:31.963 --> 01:08:33.083]  I've got three reasons, Sherry.
[01:08:33.103 --> 01:08:35.244]  You need to get a pencil and paper for reason number two.
[01:08:35.264 --> 01:08:38.085]  Reason one, we say we have rights.
[01:08:38.645 --> 01:08:41.405]  When you say you have civil rights, they come from government.
[01:08:41.445 --> 01:08:47.547]  When you say you have inalienable, not inalienable, but inalienable, like a tax lien, they come from God.
[01:08:48.227 --> 01:08:49.847]  Point two, get a pencil and paper.
[01:08:49.867 --> 01:08:56.209]  Define the United States as it pertains to dealing with government on a daily basis and in the court system.
[01:08:56.729 --> 01:08:58.630]  United States, go to U.S.
[01:08:58.730 --> 01:08:59.450]  Code, Title 2810.
[01:09:00.612 --> 01:09:08.018]  Judiciary and judicial procedure, section 3002 definitions, subsection 15.
[01:09:08.799 --> 01:09:10.240]  Sir, let me stop you.
[01:09:10.901 --> 01:09:12.843]  Let me just give you a tip for talking to people.
[01:09:13.223 --> 01:09:13.403]  Yeah.
[01:09:13.563 --> 01:09:27.175]  If you're going to get off into definitions of law and how the system really works and the fraudulent 14th Amendment making us all slaves, you might want to preface that for folks and tell them what you're about to talk about.
[01:09:28.157 --> 01:09:38.363]  Well, what I'm talking about here is we're in a world of trouble because of the fact that we've been hoodwinked into thinking what we are and what we're actually not.
[01:09:38.443 --> 01:09:45.387]  Yeah, we've been hoodwinked about the Federal Reserve being a government entity when it's listed in the business white pages.
[01:09:45.467 --> 01:09:49.489]  We've been hoodwinked about the National Security Act of 47.
[01:09:49.909 --> 01:09:52.971]  We don't know our system of government, the average person,
[01:09:53.531 --> 01:09:59.813]  As a caller said earlier, doesn't even know who John Ashcroft is, or who the Vice President is, or what the First Amendment is.
[01:09:59.893 --> 01:10:06.055]  Over two-thirds of college administrators and students don't know what the First Amendment is in a major study.
[01:10:06.515 --> 01:10:07.915]  So that's why we're in so much trouble.
[01:10:07.935 --> 01:10:11.597]  So imagine you giving people federal rulings and U.S.
[01:10:11.657 --> 01:10:12.137]  Code.
[01:10:12.297 --> 01:10:13.397]  Well, this is very simple.
[01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:14.337]  This is very simple.
[01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:17.578]  What I'm getting at is the definition pertains to U.S.
[01:10:17.598 --> 01:10:18.659]  Code 20-3000-215, paragraph 8.
[01:10:23.362 --> 01:10:26.184]  The meaning of the United States is a federal corporation.
[01:10:26.224 --> 01:10:28.265]  You're a citizen of a federal corporation!
[01:10:28.285 --> 01:10:33.148]  Yeah, they replace the rightful government with a corporation of the same name.
[01:10:33.328 --> 01:10:33.529]  Right.
[01:10:33.589 --> 01:10:45.196]  The last point that I want to make here is, when they ask you for your ID, whether you're on the street, being stopped by a police officer, or in a court system, present your ID, what is it that you present?
[01:10:45.216 --> 01:10:46.677]  You present your driver's license.
[01:10:46.737 --> 01:10:47.898]  Look at your driver's license.
[01:10:48.278 --> 01:10:49.939]  Their name is spelled in all capital letters.
[01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:51.280]  They're not looking at you saying,
[01:10:51.773 --> 01:10:55.054]  As the human... It's your corporation.
[01:10:55.414 --> 01:10:57.495]  You're right.
[01:10:57.935 --> 01:10:58.715]  You're a corporation.
[01:10:58.735 --> 01:10:59.795]  You're a corporate entity.
[01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:00.976]  A fictional corporate entity.
[01:11:02.036 --> 01:11:02.976]  And that's all you are.
[01:11:03.256 --> 01:11:07.337]  And that's what we need to turn around is our court system and turn this around.
[01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:15.459]  They get us to sign away our rights through treaties with the government through contracts.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:16.380]  Right.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.421]  And just one more other point if I may.
[01:11:19.741 --> 01:11:20.901]  When you say you're American...
[01:11:21.499 --> 01:11:24.004]  You've got to understand what you're saying there.
[01:11:24.024 --> 01:11:25.827]  Yeah, I'm a citizen of the state of Texas.
[01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:27.010]  Right, right.
[01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:28.352]  But you say you're American.
[01:11:28.633 --> 01:11:29.094]  You're D.C., Texas.
[01:11:31.512 --> 01:11:40.497]  The definitions are very important.
[01:11:40.837 --> 01:11:41.778]  Thanks for the call, John.
[01:11:42.278 --> 01:11:43.879]  I appreciate it.
[01:11:43.959 --> 01:11:46.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lou.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.681]  Lou, where are you calling us from?
[01:11:48.061 --> 01:11:48.601]  Colorado.
[01:11:49.021 --> 01:11:50.182]  Another call from Colorado.
[01:11:50.202 --> 01:11:50.822]  Go ahead.
[01:11:51.683 --> 01:11:59.547]  I just wanted, you know, in clearing up something, on that one film that you have, 9-1-1, it blow up airliners full of American citizens.
[01:12:00.262 --> 01:12:07.388]  I have a copy of the report from the Northwoods Agreement, but it should be noted that these are drone ships.
[01:12:07.569 --> 01:12:10.031]  These are unmanned vessels at its state.
[01:12:11.152 --> 01:12:14.575]  Well, actually, if you read the body of it, they will say...
[01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:25.201]  Shoot people, bomb people, kill people, and then it will restate drones, and then it will say kill them again.
[01:12:25.681 --> 01:12:36.247]  So they're saying to the president, we can blow up fake ships, or we can blow up real ships, we can crash jets, we can have college students on them, we can...
[01:12:37.273 --> 01:12:44.256]  If John Glenn dies in orbit, we can say that the Russians or the Cubans did it.
[01:12:44.837 --> 01:12:52.800]  They say we can use Army troops dressed up like Cubans to attack, shoot at, bomb Guantanamo Bay.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.503]  And your interpretation is different than mine and different than Mr. Bamford's.
[01:12:59.343 --> 01:13:01.624]  Different from John F. Kennedy's.
[01:13:02.004 --> 01:13:06.425]  That document talks about killing people, and they give the offer.
[01:13:06.585 --> 01:13:09.446]  We can really kill them, or we can stage their deaths.
[01:13:09.666 --> 01:13:13.627]  Yeah, there's one spot that does state that, but they do talk about unarmed vessels and stuff.
[01:13:13.647 --> 01:13:15.588]  But I'm just bringing this out as a matter of point.
[01:13:15.648 --> 01:13:21.030]  I'm looking at the actual Freedom of Information Act Northwoods document.
[01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:25.471]  We've got the document on the website, and we've read the entire document on air.
[01:13:25.859 --> 01:13:26.299]  Right.
[01:13:26.379 --> 01:13:28.761]  It actually talks about wounding and killing people.
[01:13:28.781 --> 01:13:30.062]  Yes, they do talk about that, too.
[01:13:30.082 --> 01:13:30.722]  More than once.
[01:13:31.002 --> 01:13:31.803]  More than once.
[01:13:31.963 --> 01:13:32.563]  Right, right.
[01:13:32.603 --> 01:13:37.527]  They say if the president wants to, we can stage it, or we can really do it.
[01:13:39.988 --> 01:13:45.251]  Well, that part I didn't see in there, but... Well, it's a... Yes, it's to the president.
[01:13:45.712 --> 01:13:46.412]  Yeah.
[01:13:46.512 --> 01:13:48.013]  It's to the Secretary of Defense.
[01:13:49.534 --> 01:13:55.258]  But anyhow, yeah, I just wanted to bring it out, because some people will question me on that as I give them the film, and that's what I...
[01:13:55.748 --> 01:13:59.412]  You know, if they pull the information out of it.
[01:13:59.432 --> 01:14:03.475]  Well, look, let me give you an example of Northwoods being implemented.
[01:14:04.697 --> 01:14:07.920]  The Gulf of Tonkin in 1964 did not take place.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:08.760]  That was fake.
[01:14:09.821 --> 01:14:11.423]  And that's Northwoods being implemented.
[01:14:11.723 --> 01:14:15.367]  Now, the USS Liberty in 1967 did take place.
[01:14:16.027 --> 01:14:17.669]  Right, right, right, yeah.
[01:14:17.709 --> 01:14:20.451]  Well, there's no doubt in my mind that they have pulled stuff like this.
[01:14:20.552 --> 01:14:20.892]  I was just...
[01:14:21.331 --> 01:14:33.774]  Talk about that one particular little thing there that I would... But if you read that document, it says, kill people, wound people, and then it gives the opportunity, or we can stage it.
[01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:37.695]  And then it talks about casualty lists, and U.S.
[01:14:37.755 --> 01:14:41.556]  newspapers will cause a helpful wave of national indignation.
[01:14:41.576 --> 01:14:42.216]  Oh, yes, yes.
[01:14:42.236 --> 01:14:43.276]  That's in there, definitely.
[01:14:43.336 --> 01:14:46.197]  I mean, they're definitely setting up a phony thing here one way or the other.
[01:14:47.579 --> 01:14:48.439]  You've got it in front of you.
[01:14:48.459 --> 01:14:49.220]  I'm going from memory.
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:54.683]  Page 9 talks about having their paramilitary forces shoot people in D.C.
[01:14:54.703 --> 01:14:58.005]  and Miami and then how to frame patsies.
[01:15:00.367 --> 01:15:01.948]  I've got page 9 in front of me here.
[01:15:03.258 --> 01:15:07.400]  They would sink a boatload of Cubans en route to Florida, real or simulated.
[01:15:07.601 --> 01:15:08.461]  See, I told you.
[01:15:08.641 --> 01:15:10.702]  You just said what I just said.
[01:15:10.902 --> 01:15:11.843]  Real or simulated.
[01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:12.963]  Real or simulated.
[01:15:13.043 --> 01:15:20.928]  But on the other ones, there was no... It just talked about... No, it does talk about shooting our troops and shooting people.
[01:15:21.348 --> 01:15:29.172]  No, I'm just talking about the ones about the unarmed... I think from memory, and you've got it in front of you, I think four times they talk about killing people and wounding them.
[01:15:30.512 --> 01:15:35.413]  Yeah, they do mention that there are some things that they would do, and they're sort of vague in a couple of factors.
[01:15:35.513 --> 01:15:38.254]  Yeah, they're not clear if they're going to kill John Glenn or not.
[01:15:39.114 --> 01:15:43.195]  Yeah, so... Then you say, if he died, it'd be helpful.
[01:15:43.235 --> 01:15:45.295]  We could blame it on the commies.
[01:15:45.355 --> 01:15:52.637]  Well, I've been giving this film out to quite a few people, and I even gave some to somebody in government, but I have a problem with these congressmen that I have out here.
[01:15:52.737 --> 01:15:56.097]  One congressman, the only one I have, is Joe Heffley.
[01:15:56.137 --> 01:15:57.618]  I wrote on that H.R.
[01:15:57.638 --> 01:15:58.058]  3289 article
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:15:59.900]  Yeah, they...
[01:16:24.033 --> 01:16:26.155]  A lot of times I just don't have the staff.
[01:16:26.335 --> 01:16:35.663]  I mean, I'm in the position of getting hundreds of phone calls a day, hundreds of emails, thousands of emails a day, and I read it, I look at it, I can't respond to it.
[01:16:36.424 --> 01:16:37.184]  But who knows?
[01:16:37.224 --> 01:16:38.065]  You need to go out.
[01:16:38.285 --> 01:16:45.612]  You know, congressmen and women have these events, Lou, where they go out and meet the constituency.
[01:16:45.652 --> 01:16:48.794]  You need to find out when they're going to have that and confront them face to face.
[01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:49.595]  Well, I will.
[01:16:49.615 --> 01:16:49.835]  I will.
[01:16:49.895 --> 01:16:50.756]  I guarantee you that.
[01:16:50.776 --> 01:16:51.737]  I definitely will.
[01:16:52.558 --> 01:16:56.352]  And has anybody ever heard any more about what that Ruben, who was with the
[01:16:56.838 --> 01:17:13.026]  Yeah, no, I mean, none of the real scammers that made the tens of billions of dollars got in trouble.
[01:17:13.386 --> 01:17:13.847]  Right.
[01:17:14.127 --> 01:17:20.470]  And, you know, the Arthur Anderson accountant there in Colorado, his decomposing body was found with gunshot wounds to the head.
[01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:21.190]  Oh, really?
[01:17:21.691 --> 01:17:26.193]  Yeah, and then we had Baxter with a gunshot wound to the head in his underwear.
[01:17:27.033 --> 01:17:30.135]  Yeah, boy, that's the truth on that.
[01:17:30.155 --> 01:17:31.556]  I just didn't know if there was any more.
[01:17:31.576 --> 01:17:36.160]  I didn't know about that one guy getting killed from the accounting firm.
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:36.480]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.521]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:17:46.909 --> 01:17:48.551]  But I just wanted to bring that out.
[01:17:48.571 --> 01:17:49.351]  Alex, you had a great show.
[01:17:49.371 --> 01:17:52.014]  And like I say, I'm getting people to wake up little by little.
[01:17:52.194 --> 01:17:54.877]  Hopefully I've got to have answers for them, too.
[01:17:55.377 --> 01:17:55.878]  Absolutely.
[01:17:55.918 --> 01:17:57.039]  I appreciate your question.
[01:17:57.079 --> 01:18:00.082]  And it's a good question about Northwoods.
[01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:04.566]  But, I mean, you just started randomly reading from page 9, and there it is.
[01:18:04.726 --> 01:18:07.369]  Sink a boatload of Cubans, whether real or not.
[01:18:07.389 --> 01:18:08.510]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:11.473]  I have to be ready to answer a question if somebody pulls this back at me.
[01:18:11.849 --> 01:18:20.893]  Well, if somebody reads the entire, what is it, 15 pages, it talks about killing and shooting people, and they say, real or simulated, real or simulated.
[01:18:21.093 --> 01:18:27.957]  And in Bamford's book, he brings out that the main was, his explosion remained undetermined.
[01:18:28.357 --> 01:18:35.320]  Nah, that's, I mean, Bamford can say it's undetermined, but the clear evidence is that they blew that ship up.
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:38.822]  Yeah, because they use, remember the main here in the Northwich document, too.
[01:18:39.542 --> 01:18:41.023]  Yeah, they say we can have another.
[01:18:41.103 --> 01:18:42.364]  It could be arranged in several forms.
[01:18:42.724 --> 01:18:45.185]  Yeah, they say we can do another Maine.
[01:18:45.685 --> 01:18:45.945]  Right.
[01:18:46.206 --> 01:18:47.206]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[01:18:47.366 --> 01:18:47.666]  Okay.
[01:18:48.287 --> 01:18:48.807]  Absolutely.
[01:18:48.847 --> 01:18:52.669]  Yeah, you have to take that document in total for the spirit of it.
[01:18:53.029 --> 01:19:01.874]  And it talks about killing real people, killing Marines, killing Cubans, shooting people in D.C., bombing D.C.,
[01:19:03.515 --> 01:19:05.597]  Wounding people, killing people.
[01:19:07.018 --> 01:19:14.925]  If John Glenn was to have an accident while in orbit, that would be helpful.
[01:19:16.166 --> 01:19:26.995]  I mean, you've got to read the whole thing, which you've obviously done, but if you've got some friend who picks out a part where they say, well, it says it could be simulated, yeah, it says it could be real, too.
[01:19:28.146 --> 01:19:34.271]  The fact that they would talk about fake attacks is bad enough, but that document, I've got to dig it out.
[01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:35.592]  It's actually in a folder over here.
[01:19:35.612 --> 01:19:38.174]  I ought to read that whole thing on air again.
[01:19:38.654 --> 01:19:43.158]  Go read it for yourself at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, the 9-11 sections.
[01:19:43.638 --> 01:19:46.841]  All right, Kenneth and Matt and others, you're going to have to hold a few minutes.

[01:21:52.347 --> 01:21:58.550]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:06.773]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:07.134 --> 01:22:12.696]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[01:22:12.984 --> 01:22:13.585]  We're good to go.
[01:22:40.393 --> 01:22:40.633]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:22:51.636 --> 01:22:56.299]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the ARC Institute.

[01:23:06.245 --> 01:23:11.408]  Imagine green beans, carrots, peas and cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, squash, herbs and more.
[01:23:11.628 --> 01:23:15.611]  Then harvest your seeds to grow year after year for old-time self-reliance.
[01:23:15.911 --> 01:23:19.632]  In living well on wheat, learn how to cook, eat, and survive on the golden grain.
[01:23:19.952 --> 01:23:22.913]  Preserve your good food for years with the USDA Canning Guide.
[01:23:23.153 --> 01:23:29.215]  In surviving a bioterrorist attack, you'll learn how to protect yourself and your family now from the attacks our government says are coming.
[01:23:29.295 --> 01:23:30.335]  Not if, but when.

[01:23:47.862 --> 01:23:49.843]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[01:23:50.404 --> 01:23:59.110]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:03.093 --> 01:24:08.097]  I've got a comment for our last caller, Lou in Colorado, who brought up a great point.
[01:24:08.996 --> 01:24:17.658]  I mean, in the Northwoods document, they say we can sink this ship, blow this ship up with these Cubans on it, and we can do it for real or we can simulate it.
[01:24:18.839 --> 01:24:25.961]  And they say we can have real sniper attacks, wound, kill people, or we can simulate it and put out false news reports.
[01:24:26.641 --> 01:24:28.822]  The point is they're talking about doing it.
[01:24:29.802 --> 01:24:32.163]  And, of course, they leave themselves that out there.
[01:24:32.263 --> 01:24:33.683]  Well, it could be simulated.
[01:24:34.637 --> 01:24:36.858]  But they go on to say, or it could be real.
[01:24:36.898 --> 01:24:44.100]  I mean, they say they're going to mortar attack and machine gun attack Marines, and they say that would be a real event.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:50.102]  This is an official government document that got green-lighted all the way up to Kennedy, who said no to it.
[01:24:50.182 --> 01:24:56.263]  Now, take... And then we saw those plans actually carried out in a bunch of different operations.
[01:24:56.864 --> 01:25:01.005]  Take the comments of...
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:04.123]  General Tommy Franks and Cigar Aficionado.
[01:25:04.384 --> 01:25:05.305]  And by the way, there was a St.
[01:25:05.345 --> 01:25:08.369]  Petersburg Times article terrified by it.
[01:25:08.389 --> 01:25:15.119]  There was a New York Times article terrified by the comments, because the media has to act like they're concerned, and some of the reporters are good people.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.946]  And they got the same interpretation that Newsmax and myself took from it.
[01:25:21.467 --> 01:25:31.561]  You know, because Frank says, well, I love America, and I'm real sad about it, but if there's another big attack, we're going to set aside the Constitution and go to a military form of government.
[01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:33.003]  It's what the people want.
[01:25:34.042 --> 01:25:38.726]  Of course he's not going to say martial law is good, but he's preparing you for it.
[01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:42.729]  He's saying that if this happens, this is what we're going to do.
[01:25:43.290 --> 01:25:47.613]  It's the outgoing head of CENTCOM saying that this is being discussed.
[01:25:47.893 --> 01:25:50.095]  Then we look around us, there's all the preparations.
[01:25:50.796 --> 01:25:59.763]  Now the article by NORTHCOM head Eberhard in the 23rd of November in the LA Times, that's on Infowars.com right now,
[01:26:01.135 --> 01:26:02.096]  Goes even further.
[01:26:02.136 --> 01:26:03.497]  He says it's going to happen.
[01:26:03.577 --> 01:26:04.418]  It is happening.
[01:26:04.458 --> 01:26:06.720]  They're getting rid of posse commentatus.
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:10.263]  They're going to run our lives, but it's a good thing.
[01:26:10.684 --> 01:26:16.229]  Then there's the Asia Times with a big article where they got a Pentagon document about martial law by 2012.
[01:26:16.449 --> 01:26:21.293]  And they say, wow, looks like it's coming a little bit early.
[01:26:21.854 --> 01:26:24.456]  But it's an incremental, bloodless coup.
[01:26:26.216 --> 01:26:31.563]  It's militarizing police, violating our liberties and rights, building giant prisons everywhere.
[01:26:31.763 --> 01:26:35.628]  They're incrementally putting up thousands of cameras in every city.
[01:26:38.172 --> 01:26:38.913]  That's what's happening.
[01:26:39.433 --> 01:26:40.174]  And then I see this.
[01:26:40.255 --> 01:26:42.698]  Supreme Court upholds political money law.
[01:26:44.207 --> 01:26:50.953]  The Supreme Court upheld key features of the nation's new law intended to lessen the influence of money in politics.
[01:26:51.313 --> 01:26:55.757]  Oh yeah, it restricts the money you or I can give as little people, but doubles what corporations can give.
[01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:56.638]  Oh, it's real good.
[01:26:57.298 --> 01:26:58.599]  And it restricts the First Amendment.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:03.764]  I mean, according to their laws, I can't have Larry Pratt on 60 days before an election.
[01:27:04.124 --> 01:27:05.245]  Okay?
[01:27:05.265 --> 01:27:06.406]  Or the ACLU, for that matter.
[01:27:06.886 --> 01:27:11.310]  Ruling will be that the government may ban unlimited donations to political parties.
[01:27:12.671 --> 01:27:23.456]  Those donations, called soft money, had become a mainstay of modern political campaigns used to rally votes to the polls and to pay for sharply worded television ads.
[01:27:23.476 --> 01:27:30.780]  That means if you're a millionaire and want to run for Congress and you're a good guy or a bad guy, it doesn't matter.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:32.501]  You can't go spend your own money, see?
[01:27:33.361 --> 01:27:38.284]  But the big corporations can do whatever they want, and it restricts the First Amendment.
[01:27:38.624 --> 01:27:39.104]  It's horrible.
[01:27:40.137 --> 01:27:42.520]  Six children die in fresh U.S.
[01:27:42.741 --> 01:27:43.642]  blunder.
[01:27:43.762 --> 01:27:44.122]  The U.S.
[01:27:44.163 --> 01:27:47.367]  military announced today that six children and two adults were killed during a U.S.
[01:27:47.407 --> 01:27:57.180]  attack on a weapons compound in southeastern Afghanistan, the second bungled operation in the country to leave child victims in the many days.
[01:27:58.655 --> 01:28:12.498]  The six children died on Friday during a night assault on a complex in Paquita province where a renegade Afghan commander, Mullah Jalan, kept a huge cache of weapons at Lieutenant Colonel Brian Helferty.
[01:28:13.558 --> 01:28:16.319]  The next day we discovered the bodies of two adults and six children.
[01:28:16.339 --> 01:28:17.639]  You can bet the numbers are higher than that.
[01:28:17.679 --> 01:28:18.500]  That's the normal tactic.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.280]  This is out of Iraq.
[01:28:21.434 --> 01:28:27.355]  With the public government out of the Associated Press, Iraq to stop counting civilian dead.
[01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:29.276]  Baghdad, Iraq.
[01:28:29.816 --> 01:28:40.979]  Iraq's health minister has ordered a halt to a count of civilians killed during the war and told its statistics department not to release figures compiled so far.
[01:28:41.459 --> 01:28:45.960]  The official who oversaw the count told the Associated Press on Wednesday.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:46.600]  That's today.
[01:28:48.809 --> 01:29:07.765]  The order was relayed by the Ministry's Director of Planning, Dr. Nazar Shambandar, but the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority, which oversees the ministry, also wanted the counting to stop, said Dr. Naham Motion, the head of the Ministry Statistics Department.
[01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:11.928]  We have stopped the collection of this information because our minister didn't agree with it.
[01:29:12.189 --> 01:29:14.951]  She said adding the CPA doesn't want this to be done.
[01:29:16.523 --> 01:29:19.846]  So the civilian casualties are in the tens of thousands.
[01:29:21.047 --> 01:29:29.233]  Our government doesn't want to count kept of that as they round up and arrest people and start kidnapping people's children to, quote, make them talk.
[01:29:29.693 --> 01:29:30.714]  That's the New York Times.
[01:29:30.794 --> 01:29:32.015]  A colonel admitted that on Monday.
[01:29:32.735 --> 01:29:34.136]  Folks, this is so bad.
[01:29:34.156 --> 01:29:36.758]  I mean, do you get how evil this is?
[01:29:37.579 --> 01:29:38.279]  Maybe you don't.
[01:29:38.339 --> 01:29:39.761]  Maybe you think evil's good.
[01:29:39.801 --> 01:29:40.261]  We'll be back.
[01:29:43.422 --> 01:29:44.324]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.824 --> 01:29:46.427]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.368 --> 01:29:50.053]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.325 --> 01:29:53.905]  You've heard of it.
[01:29:53.985 --> 01:29:54.866]  You've searched for it.
[01:29:55.026 --> 01:29:55.746]  We have it.
[01:29:55.886 --> 01:29:57.507]  I'm talking about Coral Calcium.

[01:30:55.323 --> 01:31:00.348]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[01:31:00.728 --> 01:31:03.471]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[01:31:03.931 --> 01:31:06.794]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[01:31:07.174 --> 01:31:11.538]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[01:31:11.758 --> 01:31:12.439]  That's recovery?
[01:31:16.311 --> 01:31:21.513]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[01:31:21.913 --> 01:31:23.474]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[01:31:24.154 --> 01:31:26.915]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.

[01:31:46.819 --> 01:31:48.260]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:54.302]  Hey, Doris, great news!
[01:31:54.563 --> 01:31:58.804]  I now own my own home, free and clear, and I did it in less than five months.
[01:31:58.924 --> 01:32:00.285]  Did you receive an inheritance?
[01:32:00.445 --> 01:32:00.925]  Well, no.
[01:32:01.085 --> 01:32:05.787]  Actually, I found a way to eliminate my mortgage without bankruptcy and without the need of going to court.
[01:32:05.907 --> 01:32:09.169]  And you, too, can do this legally, lawfully, ethically, and morally.
[01:32:09.249 --> 01:32:11.690]  But, Jim, I signed a note promising to pay back the loan.
[01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:13.811]  Isn't it wrong even if I could discharge the loan?
[01:32:14.071 --> 01:32:18.913]  Doris, I felt the same way until I took the time to learn the truth about money and banking.
[01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:22.914]  The most shocking thing I learned is the fact that no real money is ever loaned out.
[01:32:23.035 --> 01:32:25.736]  There's a dirty secret that the banks don't want you to know.
[01:32:25.896 --> 01:32:29.477]  And this is the basis of how I was able to discharge my own mortgage.
[01:32:29.657 --> 01:32:32.600]  I know this is hard to believe, but go to the website to learn more.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:40.126]  Doris, get your pin and find out how many Americans are finding financial freedom by having their mortgages eliminated in less than five months.
[01:32:40.326 --> 01:32:44.950]  Go to www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[01:32:45.091 --> 01:32:47.513]  Just the way it sounds and there's an S after mortgage.
[01:32:47.693 --> 01:32:52.377]  It's www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[01:33:05.712 --> 01:33:09.234]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back to 9 to midnight.
[01:33:09.294 --> 01:33:09.934]  I'm here live.
[01:33:09.994 --> 01:33:11.295]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:12.415 --> 01:33:16.377]  Let's go ahead and take a couple more calls, then I'm going to get back into more of the news here.
[01:33:17.397 --> 01:33:20.879]  Let's talk to Malta in Denmark.
[01:33:21.239 --> 01:33:22.780]  Another call from Denmark.
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:23.880]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[01:33:24.601 --> 01:33:25.041]  Hello, Alex.
[01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:26.169]  Good to talk to you.
[01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:31.531]  I just want to come into your show and you say something about these evil people.
[01:33:32.811 --> 01:33:39.654]  But I want to say something about the Anti-Democration League.
[01:33:40.054 --> 01:33:44.835]  My information, they are the arms of the Illuminati.
[01:33:44.895 --> 01:33:54.919]  Every time the Rothschilds and something else were going to get attacked, the Anti-Democration League is going to attack you.
[01:33:56.824 --> 01:33:59.065]  That's how I try here in Denmark.
[01:34:00.726 --> 01:34:02.587]  They are active all around the world.
[01:34:02.747 --> 01:34:06.348]  Are you saying that the ADL is there to demonize anybody?
[01:34:06.848 --> 01:34:10.530]  They are the arms of the Illuminati every time you attack the Illuminati.
[01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:19.274]  Well, I have found if you attack government corruption in any way and never say a word of racism, you will be attacked by the ADL.
[01:34:20.532 --> 01:34:30.296]  If you're a real live Nazi, you will be loved and supported and completely ignored by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[01:34:30.477 --> 01:34:35.179]  But the Southern Poverty Law Center is Jewish, too.
[01:34:35.199 --> 01:34:36.239]  I don't understand.
[01:34:36.259 --> 01:34:40.221]  The management of this is Jewish.
[01:34:40.941 --> 01:34:44.743]  Maybe they have some kind of connection to the anti-democracy.
[01:34:44.783 --> 01:34:45.283]  I don't know.
[01:34:46.984 --> 01:34:47.404]  Maybe that...
[01:34:48.351 --> 01:34:49.932]  Well, there's a lot of organizations.
[01:34:49.972 --> 01:34:53.875]  Look, it's a horrible thing to throw at somebody that they're racist or whatever.
[01:34:54.175 --> 01:34:56.477]  And so the government's going to have its people that do that.
[01:34:56.877 --> 01:35:00.960]  My point is that I'm against Mecha, who's racist, who's Hispanic.
[01:35:01.421 --> 01:35:05.884]  I'm against the Black Panther Party that's now become very racist under Khalid Muhammad.
[01:35:06.444 --> 01:35:09.106]  And I'm against Zionists that are racist.
[01:35:09.206 --> 01:35:12.009]  I'm against all of these groups that do this.
[01:35:12.169 --> 01:35:16.612]  And if you are against all the racists, there's nothing they can really do against you.
[01:35:17.541 --> 01:35:19.222]  And so I refuse to play the game.
[01:35:19.622 --> 01:35:21.442]  I fight corruption, period.
[01:35:23.443 --> 01:35:27.164]  We have this European constitution now in Denmark and Europe.
[01:35:27.704 --> 01:35:29.785]  We shall vote next year or next year again.
[01:35:29.805 --> 01:35:39.448]  And I start to thinking maybe they want to do something like the Homeland Security do here in Europe.
[01:35:40.416 --> 01:35:45.918]  Well, your European Union is taking your rights away and taking your national sovereignty.
[01:35:46.018 --> 01:35:47.259]  Yeah, that's for sure.
[01:35:47.279 --> 01:35:53.962]  I mean, I read about people being arrested for criticizing the government now.
[01:35:54.742 --> 01:35:56.443]  Yeah, not here in Denmark.
[01:35:56.503 --> 01:35:58.243]  We have a conservative government.
[01:35:58.504 --> 01:36:01.685]  It's sure controlled by the Illuminati to some kind of...
[01:36:02.708 --> 01:36:02.988]  Yes, sir.
[01:36:03.288 --> 01:36:06.791]  How long have you been listening to the show?
[01:36:06.871 --> 01:36:10.833]  They have problems here with this European Union.
[01:36:10.853 --> 01:36:14.075]  They don't know what they want.
[01:36:32.049 --> 01:36:45.675]  Well, most European countries have not allowed a referendum because in all the nations I've seen polls on, 70-plus percent of the people are against being under the EU, but still it expands and expands and expands.
[01:36:46.156 --> 01:36:47.696]  Okay.
[01:36:48.337 --> 01:36:52.618]  Are the people that you talk to in Denmark, are they against the EU?
[01:36:53.199 --> 01:36:56.560]  Most of them, even the Jews.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:00.122]  So the question is, why are you under the EU then?
[01:37:00.876 --> 01:37:04.099]  You know, the rock child control the media here in Denmark, too.
[01:37:04.459 --> 01:37:04.659]  Yeah.
[01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:05.840]  All right, sir.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.204]  Well, I appreciate your call from Denmark, and please spread the word, and thanks for holding.
[01:37:10.284 --> 01:37:10.945]  I will do that.
[01:37:11.405 --> 01:37:11.745]  You bet.
[01:37:11.765 --> 01:37:12.546]  Have a good weekend.
[01:37:13.587 --> 01:37:13.987]  You, too.
[01:37:14.127 --> 01:37:14.888]  Yeah, bye.
[01:37:15.449 --> 01:37:15.869]  Thank you.
[01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:17.390]  Yeah, we get calls.
[01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:20.493]  I've gotten calls from Antarctica, McMurtle Weather Station.
[01:37:20.553 --> 01:37:24.717]  I get calls from Mexico, Germany, Canada, Africa.
[01:37:25.237 --> 01:37:28.680]  Haven't gotten a call in about six months from Australia or New Zealand.
[01:37:29.583 --> 01:37:35.307]  But if you are calling from especially outside the Americas, we will get you right on the air.
[01:37:35.788 --> 01:37:39.791]  Do I have that little guest, that short guest I was going to have on?
[01:37:41.392 --> 01:37:43.273]  I appreciate you getting our guest on.
[01:37:43.633 --> 01:37:54.881]  Here in about five, ten minutes, we will go to Kenneth and Matt and Jack and others, and I'll get into Verichip signed South Africa distributorship.
[01:37:55.442 --> 01:37:58.184]  And here's another one out of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[01:37:59.637 --> 01:38:05.099]  Company aims to sell Verichip as credit card for the forgetful bionic man or woman in your life.
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:24.008]  Here's a credit card they can't possibly leave home without, a microchip the size of a grain of rice implanted in the arm, and they're moving ahead now to buy and sell, and you will scan your hand to buy and sell, as we said this chip was meant to do, and it's really owned, the company's really owned by IBM and the communist Chinese military.
[01:38:25.068 --> 01:38:27.269]  That was in their 2000 financial filings, and
[01:38:29.017 --> 01:38:33.683]  Some of the stockholders of Verichip are now suing IBM, claiming they're trying to take control.
[01:38:34.163 --> 01:38:37.267]  They already had control, as I told you, three years ago.
[01:38:37.847 --> 01:38:42.292]  But right now, we're joined by a fellow, I won't take much of his time, good friend of mine.
[01:38:42.933 --> 01:38:48.179]  He's the owner of the Alamo Draft House Cinema down in Houston, Texas, at the West Stokes.
[01:38:48.719 --> 01:38:54.442]  Shopping Center, and it's the nicest of the four Alamo Drafthouses I've been in.
[01:38:54.842 --> 01:39:03.667]  Mel Gibson was here in Austin this Sunday for a surprise showing of the Passion, or the Passion of Christ.
[01:39:04.087 --> 01:39:05.188]  They have lengthened the name.
[01:39:08.271 --> 01:39:12.013]  We're going to be down in the Alamo Drafthouse in Houston.
[01:39:12.494 --> 01:39:18.177]  I'm going to be there showing 9-11 Road to Tyranny, and then, of course, John Carpenter's They Live.
[01:39:18.197 --> 01:39:30.305]  I'm going to give a 30-minute speech, show Road to Tyranny at 6.30, and then at about 9.30 or so we'll have a question and answer, then we'll show John Carpenter's They Live.
[01:39:30.666 --> 01:39:32.307]  Great place to network and meet folks.
[01:39:32.687 --> 01:39:34.228]  And last time we did this...
[01:39:36.027 --> 01:39:39.192]  At about Wednesday, we'd sold about 40 tickets online.
[01:39:40.213 --> 01:39:42.496]  And I was worried, oh, will there be a big crowd?
[01:39:42.916 --> 01:39:46.882]  Then by 7 o'clock when it started, we had sold all the tickets.
[01:39:47.552 --> 01:39:49.733]  And had to turn away hundreds of people.
[01:39:50.154 --> 01:40:00.740]  So buy your tickets early or show up at least 30 minutes before because everybody procrastinates and then doesn't get to get into the film.
[01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:05.203]  Now this is the second showing, so the crowds may not be as big this time, but I think we're going to sell out.
[01:40:05.824 --> 01:40:18.865]  And I hope to see everybody go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com, link through to the Alamo Drafthouse website, and buy tickets via their secure online server to this double feature.
[01:40:19.779 --> 01:40:21.840]  And that's coming up this Saturday.
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:30.126]  And, folks, it's such a nice theater, luxury theater, wonderful seats, your own tables, seats over 300 people.
[01:40:31.186 --> 01:40:33.808]  It's such a nice place.
[01:40:33.848 --> 01:40:36.089]  They've got pizza, hamburgers, all that stuff.
[01:40:36.129 --> 01:40:40.612]  But fellow patriot Travis Doss joins us.
[01:40:40.712 --> 01:40:42.293]  And, Travis, good to have you on the show.
[01:40:42.433 --> 01:40:42.974]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:43.134 --> 01:40:43.614]  Thank you.
[01:40:43.954 --> 01:40:44.655]  You bet.
[01:40:44.715 --> 01:40:46.416]  Last time was a big success, wasn't it?
[01:40:46.816 --> 01:40:48.457]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[01:40:48.758 --> 01:40:52.500]  The last show was done on September 11th, as you all know.
[01:40:53.141 --> 01:40:57.244]  And, yeah, it exceeded our expectations tremendously.
[01:40:57.584 --> 01:40:59.005]  That was a Thursday, wasn't it?
[01:40:59.645 --> 01:41:00.026]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:00.046 --> 01:41:05.169]  Because I got back in the car that night at 1230 and drove home and did the radio show the next day.
[01:41:05.630 --> 01:41:08.031]  By this time, I'm going to be staying down there in Houston.
[01:41:09.532 --> 01:41:12.935]  It was an amazing event to see all these people interacting.
[01:41:12.995 --> 01:41:14.536]  That's the reason I look forward to going.
[01:41:15.351 --> 01:41:16.372]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:16.952 --> 01:41:24.597]  We had people emailing me for weeks after we did it, lamenting the fact that they weren't able to be there and see you.
[01:41:25.217 --> 01:41:35.684]  I actually had other theater owners from around the country calling me and were jealous that we had you, so it was pretty interesting.
[01:41:36.644 --> 01:41:40.887]  Yeah, I get calls every week from theaters that want to show Road to Tyranny, and I'm
[01:41:42.574 --> 01:41:45.615]  But they always want me to come there, and I just can't do it because of the radio show.
[01:41:45.635 --> 01:41:47.576]  I'm not bragging, oh, I'm in such demand.
[01:41:48.076 --> 01:41:55.659]  The good news here is that people care, people know the truth about September 11th, and I think it's going to be a big success this time.
[01:41:55.699 --> 01:41:59.761]  But, Travis, wouldn't you encourage folks to go online now and go ahead and get the tickets?
[01:42:00.001 --> 01:42:01.841]  Yeah, absolutely, so they won't be disappointed.
[01:42:01.921 --> 01:42:05.883]  Absolutely, yeah, there was a tremendous amount of people who were disappointed last time.
[01:42:06.543 --> 01:42:10.306]  I would highly encourage them to come if they can.
[01:42:10.346 --> 01:42:12.807]  The interesting thing was it didn't sell out until about 6.50.
[01:42:14.328 --> 01:42:18.731]  A bunch of people showed up right when it's supposed to start.
[01:42:19.231 --> 01:42:23.214]  So folks, just show up a little early if you're not online.
[01:42:23.654 --> 01:42:27.397]  I don't want to discourage people to not show up because they think they can't get tickets.
[01:42:28.557 --> 01:42:33.941]  If you know somebody who does have a computer, get them to go online and get you the tickets.
[01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:41.092]  Yeah, they should definitely come, and we're going to try to get you starting speaking at 6 p.m.
[01:42:41.132 --> 01:42:43.874]  sharp so that we can have the full amount of time.
[01:42:43.914 --> 01:42:50.878]  That was probably the highlight of it, the Q&A that you did and just you sharing your thoughts.
[01:42:51.972 --> 01:42:54.513]  Hey, did you get a chance to come down and see Mel Gibson this weekend?
[01:42:54.853 --> 01:42:57.474]  No, unfortunately I had to work, so no, I couldn't make it.
[01:42:57.714 --> 01:42:58.415]  I wish I could have.
[01:42:58.755 --> 01:43:03.957]  Well, I had heard the rumor that Harry Knowles was going to have him there, but I said, I'm going deer hunting.
[01:43:03.977 --> 01:43:07.638]  I'm not going to try to weasel into that, even though I'd have loved to have gone.
[01:43:09.818 --> 01:43:11.218]  That was certainly interesting.
[01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:15.379]  And actually, the leftist newspaper said, I don't get why the ADL is attacking Gibson.
[01:43:15.639 --> 01:43:17.120]  This film isn't bad.
[01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:18.120]  That is interesting.
[01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:24.401]  That was a lot of the reviews that I heard that said, what's the big deal?
[01:43:25.862 --> 01:43:27.082]  Well, that shows the insanity.
[01:43:27.242 --> 01:43:39.365]  Arnold can scream in front of thousands that he hates black people at a bodybuilding contest in 1978 and can campaign for Nazis, and he's okay, but Gibson has never done anything anti-Semitic, and he gets attacked.
[01:43:40.596 --> 01:43:41.036]  I don't know.
[01:43:41.596 --> 01:43:44.617]  I guess it's just a leftist kind of tool to demonize anything.
[01:43:44.677 --> 01:43:45.678]  It's like the Ten Commandments.
[01:43:47.678 --> 01:43:48.859]  I don't know.
[01:43:49.439 --> 01:43:52.660]  Travis, how do folks get to the Alamo Draft House there in Houston?
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:55.001]  We're located on the west side of Houston.
[01:43:55.721 --> 01:43:58.102]  We're located at Westheimer and Highway 6.
[01:43:59.389 --> 01:44:03.793]  And if anybody needs better directions, they can go to our website.
[01:44:04.213 --> 01:44:10.378]  It's www.drafthouse.com, and then they would click on West Oaks.
[01:44:10.458 --> 01:44:11.799]  We're at the West Oaks Mall.
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:17.144]  And your mascot is a fitting individual, John Wayne.
[01:44:17.164 --> 01:44:18.084]  Yeah.
[01:44:18.345 --> 01:44:20.506]  And it's Remember the Alamo, folks.
[01:44:20.566 --> 01:44:22.408]  You can't forget that.
[01:44:23.422 --> 01:44:24.663]  And a lot of great folks involved.
[01:44:25.003 --> 01:44:27.664]  And I really enjoyed the Houston crowd.
[01:44:28.105 --> 01:44:35.169]  And folks came in from far away as, I think, states like Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico.
[01:44:35.889 --> 01:44:38.931]  And so I look forward to seeing everybody there this Saturday.
[01:44:38.951 --> 01:44:40.312]  I look forward to seeing you again, Travis.
[01:44:40.472 --> 01:44:41.092]  Absolutely.
[01:44:42.933 --> 01:44:45.294]  I know the staff had a lot of fun last time, too.
[01:44:45.454 --> 01:44:46.615]  They're looking forward to it, aren't they?
[01:44:46.815 --> 01:44:47.816]  Oh, of course, of course.
[01:44:47.856 --> 01:44:49.537]  Yeah, we've got a great staff and...
[01:44:50.370 --> 01:44:57.662]  And I think everybody who came, we had a lot of people who hadn't been here before, and I think everybody had a really good time.
[01:44:58.643 --> 01:45:00.907]  I think your film was fantastic.
[01:45:01.287 --> 01:45:05.454]  I think there's probably a lot of people who haven't seen the John Carpenter film.
[01:45:06.116 --> 01:45:07.537]  I think it's interesting.
[01:45:23.129 --> 01:45:33.175]  Well, I mean, I'm showing they live because it's a good way to get people to look behind the surface, to think about the big picture, to shift their paradigm.
[01:45:33.555 --> 01:45:37.438]  It's an analogy of what we're really facing.
[01:45:38.058 --> 01:45:40.540]  And one more time for folks that just joined us.
[01:45:42.427 --> 01:45:45.830]  How do they get to the Alamo Drafthouse at the West Oak Shopping Center?
[01:45:45.850 --> 01:45:46.230]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:48.452]  We're on the far west side of Houston.
[01:45:49.132 --> 01:45:54.536]  We're three miles south of I-10 on Highway 6 at Westheimer.
[01:45:54.556 --> 01:46:00.461]  It's Highway 6 at Westheimer, three miles south of I-10 on Highway 6.
[01:46:00.841 --> 01:46:11.990]  We're inside of the West Oak Mall, and you can once again go to www.drafthouse.com and click on West Oaks, and it will take you directly to our website.
[01:46:12.697 --> 01:46:13.417]  Absolutely.
[01:46:13.617 --> 01:46:18.820]  And your link is on the top right-hand corner of the West Oaks homepage.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:24.462]  If they just click on your Road to Tyranny link, it'll take them right to where they can buy tickets.
[01:46:25.102 --> 01:46:26.643]  And you are a freedom lover.
[01:46:26.703 --> 01:46:30.184]  Your dad has been a radio listener here in Austin for years.
[01:46:30.644 --> 01:46:31.004]  Oh, yeah.
[01:46:31.425 --> 01:46:33.906]  And I always enjoy getting to see him, and I hope he'll be there.
[01:46:33.926 --> 01:46:36.007]  He's standing here right now listening to you.
[01:46:37.876 --> 01:46:39.557]  All right, well, say hi to your dad for me.
[01:46:39.677 --> 01:46:40.277]  Absolutely.
[01:46:40.497 --> 01:46:41.518]  Do you want to put your dad on?
[01:46:41.558 --> 01:46:42.678]  Yeah, I'll put him on right now.
[01:46:42.998 --> 01:46:43.258]  Okay.
[01:46:44.759 --> 01:46:45.499]  Alex, how you doing?
[01:46:45.699 --> 01:46:47.280]  Hey, Mr. Doss, good to talk to you.
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:48.340]  Oh, good talking to you.
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:50.321]  We're excited about you being here this weekend.
[01:46:51.002 --> 01:46:58.785]  Well, I love doing it, and the crowd was so awesome last time that I look forward to coming there again, and hopefully in the future we can show some of the other films there.
[01:46:59.125 --> 01:47:03.147]  We want to do it, and we're available for you anytime you want to come, Alex.
[01:47:03.187 --> 01:47:06.168]  We believe in what you're doing, and we're excited to help.
[01:47:06.727 --> 01:47:09.388]  What do you think about the developments in the New World Order right now?
[01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:16.451]  You know, Alex, I hope that you can help people wake up to what's going on.
[01:47:16.491 --> 01:47:28.856]  This whole New World Order, it's been around for so long, and people seem to be waking up now, but only because you and some of the folks on your show there have told the truth.
[01:47:30.037 --> 01:47:43.824]  Well, that's the key to standing up against evil is just, well, I think Mark Twain said it best in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared, but in time when his cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:47:44.284 --> 01:47:50.928]  And there's thousands of people that hit the barbed wire before I did and others did that opened that wedge up for us.
[01:47:50.988 --> 01:47:55.590]  But it's life and death now, and to defend our way of life and our heritage, we've got to do it.
[01:47:55.630 --> 01:47:59.192]  And thanks a lot for all your support, Mr. Doss, and tell Travis thank you.
[01:47:59.432 --> 01:47:59.792]  I'll do it.
[01:47:59.872 --> 01:48:00.313]  Thanks a lot.
[01:48:00.513 --> 01:48:01.194]  Take care, my friend.
[01:48:01.214 --> 01:48:01.794]  I'll see you this Saturday.
[01:48:01.814 --> 01:48:02.154]  See you Saturday.
[01:48:02.855 --> 01:48:03.636]  All right, folks.
[01:48:04.136 --> 01:48:11.342]  I'm going to go to your calls, loaded phones here in just a minute, but I appreciate them coming on the show and look forward to seeing folks in Houston this weekend.
[01:48:13.204 --> 01:48:18.929]  Company aims to sell self-verity as credit card.
[01:48:18.969 --> 01:48:20.790]  Again, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:23.693]  Five years ago, two years ago, did you ever think you'd be hearing about this?
[01:48:24.932 --> 01:48:33.808]  For the forgetful bionic man or woman in your life, here's a credit card they can't possibly leave home without, a microchip the size of a grain of rice implanted in the arm.
[01:48:34.631 --> 01:48:48.782]  The Verichip, which transmits a unique ID number by radio frequency to a scanner, actually has been implanted in more than 30 people for a variety of potential applications, including as a building ID badge, medical bracelet, and anti-kidnapping device.
[01:48:49.102 --> 01:48:56.828]  Now the chip's creator, Applied Digital Solutions of Palm Beach, Florida, is pitching it as a digital wallet that would automatically make purchases in stores.
[01:48:57.689 --> 01:49:00.391]  They've also signed a deal with the Bureau of Prisons in California.
[01:49:00.431 --> 01:49:03.113]  When that went public, it fell apart.
[01:49:04.225 --> 01:49:12.229]  And they've signed a deal with the Communist Chinese to implant their population, and that's where the big plant is based in Beijing, and it's owned by IBM.
[01:49:12.489 --> 01:49:13.490]  This is their front company.
[01:49:13.810 --> 01:49:14.550]  Now listen to this.
[01:49:14.590 --> 01:49:15.310]  It gets even worse.
[01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:18.352]  This isn't Alex Jones saying it was a Walmart plant.
[01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:21.771]  Involved with the RFID, because that's what the Verichip is.
[01:49:22.331 --> 01:49:24.151]  It's the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[01:49:24.551 --> 01:49:25.291]  Listen to this.
[01:49:25.871 --> 01:49:41.135]  The device employs Radio Frequency Identification Technology, or RFID, which companies such as Walmart stores are testing for more mundane purposes, such as tracking inventory and ringing up products at the register.
[01:49:41.635 --> 01:49:44.595]  They want to force out the barcode, which they implemented in 1984.
[01:49:44.836 --> 01:49:46.936]  For example...
[01:49:47.882 --> 01:49:56.929]  A chip embedded in a product or its packaging can transmit signals informing the retailer that it is removed from the shelf or purchased and needs replacing.
[01:49:57.169 --> 01:49:59.591]  But how does one install such a chip in a human?
[01:49:59.991 --> 01:50:01.432]  Easy, says Applied Digital.
[01:50:02.553 --> 01:50:08.958]  Now, again, we cannot become desensitized or acclimated just because there's hundreds of articles every month about how wonderful it is.
[01:50:10.282 --> 01:50:12.363]  Hey, you're not going to be independent, like our treaty with you says.
[01:50:37.461 --> 01:50:39.443]  This isn't status quo as he's tried to spin it.
[01:50:39.623 --> 01:50:41.384]  This is a major change in course.
[01:50:41.645 --> 01:50:43.326]  Bill Clinton wouldn't talk like this.
[01:50:44.627 --> 01:50:46.829]  He'd be called a commie, but Bush can do it.
[01:50:47.349 --> 01:50:48.550]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:48.630 --> 01:50:49.191]  Stay with us.
[01:50:53.786 --> 01:50:57.349]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:58.009]  Yes.
[01:50:58.289 --> 01:51:03.093]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[01:51:03.213 --> 01:51:12.140]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:20.006]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[01:51:20.226 --> 01:51:22.448]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[01:51:22.768 --> 01:51:29.831]  The 200 pages of our book, Wheatgrass, Nature's Finest Medicine, will remove any anxieties you may have about your nutritional supply.
[01:51:29.971 --> 01:51:33.672]  In this kit, you will receive no monthly bills, no monthly pills.
[01:51:33.832 --> 01:51:35.453]  This is real self-sufficiency.
[01:51:35.553 --> 01:51:46.877]  To get more information about Wheatgrass, the book, seed, and the beautiful stainless steel wheatgrass juicer, go to austinwheatgrass.com or call toll-free 1-877-MY-WHEAT.
[01:51:47.137 --> 01:51:50.418]  And thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[01:51:53.101 --> 01:52:01.728]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:52:01.948 --> 01:52:13.217]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:52:13.437 --> 01:52:16.099]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:20.523]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:52:20.643 --> 01:52:21.183]  We're good to go.
[01:52:50.670 --> 01:52:57.332]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:52:57.532 --> 01:53:01.934]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:53:02.094 --> 01:53:06.455]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:53:06.515 --> 01:53:07.856]  The New World Order.
[01:53:08.616 --> 01:53:09.617]  Can emerge.
[01:53:09.657 --> 01:53:13.862]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:53:13.922 --> 01:53:20.869]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:53:21.009 --> 01:53:22.991]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:53:23.379 --> 01:53:33.707]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:53:33.988 --> 01:53:39.352]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:53:39.872 --> 01:53:42.494]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:53:42.614 --> 01:53:43.795]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:43.815 --> 01:53:44.256]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:53:44.276 --> 01:53:46.057]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:54:02.792 --> 01:54:06.996]  All right, we'll be taking your calls, getting through these folks that have been holding here in the next few segments.
[01:54:07.056 --> 01:54:10.679]  Then we've got the lawyer with the class action suit member up there.
[01:54:11.690 --> 01:54:23.178]  At that public school with all the cameras and the drug dogs, now we learn grabbing on the bags and shaking things and terrifying the children, the guns to their heads, no drugs found.
[01:54:23.999 --> 01:54:25.460]  All part of martial law, folks.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:26.801]  That's martial law.
[01:54:27.221 --> 01:54:30.864]  They weren't that brutal in Germany until they got you to the camp.
[01:54:32.605 --> 01:54:35.647]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[01:54:35.707 --> 01:54:37.829]  Before I go to Ken and Matt and
[01:54:38.636 --> 01:54:45.501]  Jack and Charlie and everybody else, I want to encourage everybody, my first plug of the day for this, to get my videos.
[01:54:45.622 --> 01:54:46.822]  I've made 10 films.
[01:54:47.603 --> 01:54:49.264]  You don't have to come to Houston to see them.
[01:54:49.945 --> 01:54:56.370]  You can get 9-11, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, my newest film, Matrix of Evil.
[01:54:57.774 --> 01:54:58.495]  We're good to go.
[01:54:58.515 --> 01:54:58.975]  We're good to go.
[01:55:18.063 --> 01:55:18.403]  We're good to go.
[01:55:43.706 --> 01:55:43.886]  Thank you.
[01:55:43.906 --> 01:55:44.106]  Thank you.
[01:56:09.851 --> 01:56:17.173]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:56:18.613 --> 01:56:20.533]  And your purchase also makes this show possible.
[01:56:21.133 --> 01:56:26.115]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kenneth in Texas.
[01:56:26.135 --> 01:56:26.555]  Go ahead.
[01:56:26.575 --> 01:56:27.595]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:56:27.775 --> 01:56:28.195]  Fine, sir.
[01:56:28.495 --> 01:56:29.575]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:56:30.135 --> 01:56:34.376]  I want to make a real quick mention of what that lady had to say earlier in the hour about the churches.
[01:56:35.497 --> 01:56:37.497]  You know, they worship George Bush or whatever.
[01:56:38.438 --> 01:56:47.384]  I've seen good Christian men, you know, Clint Eastwood type, and about in three years' time, the churches effeminated them, and they were dancing ballerinas.
[01:56:48.245 --> 01:56:50.486]  And they're good preachers on shortwave.
[01:56:50.546 --> 01:57:00.053]  I listen to Pete Peters and Tex Mars, and those preachers right there got more tossed around than probably a lot of the male preachers in this country put together.
[01:57:00.753 --> 01:57:04.696]  But I called about the, what did I call about?
[01:57:04.796 --> 01:57:06.277]  The underground bunkers.
[01:57:07.908 --> 01:57:08.288]  You know what?
[01:57:08.328 --> 01:57:15.655]  I've got a feeling that I say let them build them underground bunkers because I think those underground bunkers are their tomb.
[01:57:16.976 --> 01:57:23.442]  I think the next terrorist act, major terrorist act, is going to be committed by Jesus Christ himself.
[01:57:24.243 --> 01:57:24.543]  Psalm 58.
[01:57:25.044 --> 01:57:27.186]  I want everybody to look at it.
[01:57:27.206 --> 01:57:29.248]  So you think the earthquakes in Oklahoma and...
[01:57:30.137 --> 01:57:31.798]  And the Carolinas are God.
[01:57:31.818 --> 01:57:34.820]  Well, I'm not going to say that.
[01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:36.881]  I'm not going to say that at all.
[01:57:36.961 --> 01:57:42.384]  I'm just saying I encourage patriots and Christians alike to read Psalm 58 tonight.
[01:57:42.545 --> 01:57:48.668]  Well, talking about the secret government, in Road to Tyranny I have the Washington Post where they admit that the, quote, secret government's in control.
[01:57:49.169 --> 01:57:51.670]  Congress, the headline is shadow government.
[01:57:51.690 --> 01:57:52.891]  That's what the White House called it.
[01:57:53.631 --> 01:57:55.793]  The rich elite are moving out of the country.
[01:57:55.873 --> 01:57:56.793]  That is happening.
[01:57:57.013 --> 01:57:58.034]  The question is why?
[01:58:02.021 --> 01:58:09.624]  I think, from what I hear, they might want to use Russia to destroy America, but I think God might have different plans.
[01:58:12.225 --> 01:58:15.727]  Well, the globalists are a pack of criminals, and there's no telling what's going to happen.
[01:58:15.767 --> 01:58:16.427]  I just know this.
[01:58:16.487 --> 01:58:19.968]  We're in the most dangerous period of history we have ever been in.
[01:58:20.509 --> 01:58:20.809]  All right.
[01:58:21.349 --> 01:58:22.349]  Hey, thank you for the call.
[01:58:22.369 --> 01:58:23.970]  Appreciate it, Kenneth.
[01:58:24.490 --> 01:58:28.392]  We'll come back and talk to Matt and Jack and Charles, and we've got our guest coming on.
[01:58:29.542 --> 01:58:35.870]  You think you know the whole story of what happened up there at that Goose Creek school?
[01:58:36.811 --> 01:58:38.473]  Well, you're going to find out a little bit more.
[01:58:39.615 --> 01:58:41.097]  And is this coming to a school near you?
[01:58:43.664 --> 01:58:54.389]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:58:54.569 --> 01:59:02.153]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:02.373 --> 01:59:03.674]  The system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:59:18.368 --> 01:59:22.249]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:59:22.309 --> 01:59:24.210]  The water level is always visible.
[01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:30.312]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:59:30.552 --> 01:59:34.254]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:34.274 --> 01:59:34.774]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:59:50.069 --> 01:59:50.709]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.369 --> 01:59:52.430]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.150 --> 01:59:54.250]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.891 --> 01:59:55.711]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.471 --> 01:59:58.392]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.412 --> 02:00:01.653]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.233 --> 02:00:06.334]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.775 --> 02:00:19.078]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, we're here live, Waging War on Corruption.
[02:00:19.736 --> 02:00:21.656]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[02:00:22.417 --> 02:00:32.999]  Coming up, we're going to have a guest on talking about what happened up there at that Goose Creek school with the police dogs and the searches and the drawn guns and the class action suit that's been filed.
[02:00:33.319 --> 02:00:36.499]  Dwayne Green of Charleston is their attorney.
[02:00:36.519 --> 02:00:39.180]  He'll be joining us here in a few minutes.
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:43.260]  And I've got a bunch of other big brother police state news.
[02:00:43.381 --> 02:00:44.921]  Knowing is half the battle, folks.
[02:00:44.941 --> 02:00:45.841]  We're here exposing it.
[02:00:46.768 --> 02:00:49.470]  But right now, let's go to the calls.
[02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:52.172]  Matt in Louisiana, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:00:53.893 --> 02:01:02.779]  This isn't what I'm going to talk about, but just hearing your last caller, whenever I hear the word shadow government, why in the world couldn't they have gotten a better name?
[02:01:03.099 --> 02:01:05.621]  I mean, if it weren't so serious, it sounds comical.
[02:01:07.432 --> 02:01:09.193]  Yeah, and this is a great point.
[02:01:09.753 --> 02:01:13.554]  Why did the Bush White House come out and go, the shadow government is now in control?
[02:01:13.834 --> 02:01:15.254]  They want it to sound ominous.
[02:01:15.495 --> 02:01:17.915]  Homeland Security is meant to sound ominous.
[02:01:18.155 --> 02:01:19.976]  The black ski masks are meant to scare us.
[02:01:20.196 --> 02:01:25.037]  They're meant to scare those of us in the know and doubly dumb down the idiots out there.
[02:01:25.057 --> 02:01:28.599]  Well, I tell you what, Homeland Security is getting scarier today.
[02:01:28.619 --> 02:01:33.060]  Have you heard what Tom Ridge, this is why I'm calling, did you hear what Tom Ridge told a Miami audience yesterday?
[02:01:34.373 --> 02:01:38.455]  I have an article on that, and I have not read it even myself yet.
[02:01:38.495 --> 02:01:40.056]  I printed it off as I ran out the door.
[02:01:40.076 --> 02:01:40.617]  What did he say?
[02:01:40.637 --> 02:01:47.480]  There's an article today in the Sun Sentinel, Miami-Dade County News, by a writer called Tanya Weinberg.
[02:01:48.241 --> 02:02:00.968]  And last night in Miami, of all places, Tom Ridge was talking for a nonprofit, a Council for Excellence in Government, and he straight out said he endorses legalizing undocumented immigrants.
[02:02:01.628 --> 02:02:03.449]  And this is a Homeland Security chief.
[02:02:04.743 --> 02:02:08.505]  Bush has said he wants blanket open borders, end of sovereignty.
[02:02:08.525 --> 02:02:09.825]  It's the Pan-American Union.
[02:02:10.645 --> 02:02:11.346]  It's crazy.
[02:02:11.446 --> 02:02:20.849]  And then just to hear his double speech, there's a quote from a minute that says, quote, this is Tom Ridge, I'm not saying make them citizens because they violated the law to get here.
[02:02:21.469 --> 02:02:24.971]  So you don't reward that type of conduct by turning over a citizenship certificate.
[02:02:25.371 --> 02:02:27.432]  You determine how you can legalize their presence.
[02:02:27.552 --> 02:02:31.313]  Then, as a country, you make a decision that from this day forward...
[02:02:31.806 --> 02:02:37.029]  This is the process of entry, and if you violate that process, we have resources to cope with it.
[02:02:37.729 --> 02:02:44.733]  Oh, so if you get here, you're legal, kind of a super citizen, but that's okay, this is how we deal with it.
[02:02:44.773 --> 02:02:46.674]  That is amazing doublespeak.
[02:02:47.495 --> 02:02:54.558]  And I saw this there today, and it's starting to get picked up by some other people, but I can send it to you because it needs to get out.
[02:02:54.578 --> 02:02:55.938]  No, I actually do have the article.
[02:02:56.359 --> 02:02:57.039]  Okay.
[02:02:57.099 --> 02:02:58.699]  But, I mean, folks, think about this.
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:00.080]  The border stays wide open.
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:08.523]  They'll accept any fake matricula card from Poland or Guatemala or Mexico, but as citizens, we're going to have the Pentagon watching us.
[02:03:10.884 --> 02:03:12.525]  I mean, for me, that is really...
[02:03:13.243 --> 02:03:22.928]  I was out in Colorado this summer listening to you every day on 1380, which was awesome, by the way, to not have to be on computer or shortwave right out there in the open.
[02:03:23.128 --> 02:03:27.090]  And, you know, when you started talking about that, it really all came home to me.
[02:03:27.630 --> 02:03:31.552]  Open borders, yet police us to death.
[02:03:31.953 --> 02:03:36.595]  I mean, that's the one thing that for me really makes people click and say, wow, there is something to this.
[02:03:37.262 --> 02:03:40.263]  And then you find the government funding the terrorists, having a motive.
[02:03:41.363 --> 02:03:49.285]  Bush now has James Baker running the hundreds of billions of dollars of Iraq's spending and giving out the contracts.
[02:03:49.685 --> 02:03:50.665]  No bids allowed.
[02:03:50.725 --> 02:03:54.346]  I mean, this is just ridiculous corruption right out in the open.
[02:03:55.406 --> 02:03:58.147]  And now he says, Taiwan, we're cutting you loose.
[02:04:00.608 --> 02:04:02.428]  Imagine if Bill Clinton would have tried that.
[02:04:03.365 --> 02:04:06.588]  Well, one, they would have, I mean, he was already getting called a commie.
[02:04:06.608 --> 02:04:07.889]  If he would have said that, good Lord.
[02:04:07.929 --> 02:04:13.895]  But, you know, we're going into one country to build a democracy, Iraq, allegedly.
[02:04:14.315 --> 02:04:17.078]  Another, communist country, wants to become a democracy.
[02:04:17.758 --> 02:04:22.563]  And we say, no, you've got to go back in with mainland China.
[02:04:22.743 --> 02:04:27.087]  It's just time and time again from every corner, we're just hearing...
[02:04:27.563 --> 02:04:31.885]  Contradictory misinformation, and all you have to do is open up a newspaper.
[02:04:32.225 --> 02:04:42.991]  But again, again, then Jack, the average American doesn't even know what the First Amendment is or where Iraq is, but they'll form an opinion off watching Peter Jennings.
[02:04:43.191 --> 02:04:43.751]  We'll be back.
[02:04:46.064 --> 02:04:53.452]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:04:53.733 --> 02:04:58.478]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:04:58.698 --> 02:05:04.345]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:05:04.585 --> 02:05:09.107]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:05:09.327 --> 02:05:16.469]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:05:16.489 --> 02:05:21.031]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:05:21.191 --> 02:05:23.712]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:05:23.932 --> 02:05:30.634]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:05:30.874 --> 02:05:36.137]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:36.157 --> 02:05:36.578]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:44.927 --> 02:05:48.190]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:05:48.250 --> 02:05:52.433]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:05:52.673 --> 02:05:55.476]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:05:55.656 --> 02:05:58.058]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:05:58.258 --> 02:06:06.905]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:06:07.105 --> 02:06:08.446]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:06:08.647 --> 02:06:12.890]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:06:13.110 --> 02:06:14.831]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[02:06:15.091 --> 02:06:27.019]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[02:06:27.239 --> 02:06:33.723]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[02:06:33.984 --> 02:06:36.830]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:37.672]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:06:44.474 --> 02:06:50.500]  Oh my... I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:06:50.661 --> 02:06:51.261]  Yes, it's true.
[02:06:51.281 --> 02:06:54.044]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:06:54.184 --> 02:06:58.169]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[02:06:58.249 --> 02:06:58.829]  You heard it right.
[02:06:58.989 --> 02:07:03.975]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[02:07:04.035 --> 02:07:05.076]  The list goes on and on.
[02:07:05.316 --> 02:07:06.056]  You may miss out forever.
[02:07:22.005 --> 02:07:22.425]  We're good to go.
[02:07:48.812 --> 02:07:54.493]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:57.373 --> 02:08:12.756]  All right, my friends, we're 8 minutes and 15 seconds into this third hour, blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Los Angeles, California, to Providence Road Island, from Austin, Texas, to Kansas City, Missouri, from Denver, Colorado, to Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[02:08:13.756 --> 02:08:17.897]  And last month, we started talking about the shocking video images
[02:08:19.056 --> 02:08:26.857]  Out of South Carolina at Goose Creek in Berkeley County School District.
[02:08:27.655 --> 02:08:36.139]  Hundreds of children handcuffed, on their knees, police pointing loaded guns at them, which, by the way, in some of the drills, they've shot children and other police.
[02:08:36.159 --> 02:08:38.220]  This is very, very, very dangerous.
[02:08:38.941 --> 02:08:51.187]  And I hope these law firms that are suing in the class action suit will do a LexisNexis search and pull up where they shot children up in Detroit, where they shot Cop of the Year in Fort Worth during one of these drills.
[02:08:51.767 --> 02:08:53.808]  This is very dangerous, and they know it.
[02:08:54.514 --> 02:08:57.516]  And then no drugs were found, but we're all guilty until proven innocent.
[02:08:57.536 --> 02:08:58.917]  Now new videos come out.
[02:08:58.997 --> 02:09:17.088]  It's on Infowars.com, on my website, where they have the vicious German shepherd trained in drug interdiction and in attack dog techniques, grabbing and savaging a backpack on a child's back.
[02:09:17.828 --> 02:09:19.009]  And here's an article.
[02:09:19.869 --> 02:09:23.392]  Out of the Associated Press, Raid might have broken drug dog rules.
[02:09:23.772 --> 02:09:26.835]  They're supposed to take backpacks and jackets off of people.
[02:09:27.055 --> 02:09:31.078]  You're not supposed to put the dog on a human being because they have a good chance of biting them.
[02:09:31.298 --> 02:09:32.199]  And they knew that.
[02:09:32.379 --> 02:09:34.281]  But they also aimed guns at their heads.
[02:09:34.721 --> 02:09:35.942]  And no drugs were found.
[02:09:36.883 --> 02:09:41.166]  And by the way, most of the students were singled out, were black.
[02:09:41.306 --> 02:09:42.087]  Two-thirds of them.
[02:09:42.607 --> 02:09:44.108]  I know we've got a lot of callers on this subject.
[02:09:44.128 --> 02:09:44.789]  We're going to get to it.
[02:09:46.054 --> 02:09:53.227]  Jack and Chris and Mike and Frank and everybody, I'm joined by one of the lawyers, one of the attorneys, Duane Green.
[02:09:55.104 --> 02:09:56.526]  Here on the show.
[02:09:57.246 --> 02:10:02.051]  And there's also some other big law firms that have been involved, even the big tobacco suits.
[02:10:02.371 --> 02:10:04.313]  Some heavy guns involved in this.
[02:10:04.913 --> 02:10:08.817]  And to give us details of what's really going on is Dwayne Green.
[02:10:08.857 --> 02:10:20.508]  And Dwayne, I appreciate you taking time out to come on the show to help us expose this miscarriage, this abuse of these young people.
[02:10:20.888 --> 02:10:22.549]  Well, thank you very much for having me, Alex.
[02:10:22.589 --> 02:10:23.550]  I'm glad to be here.
[02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:24.871]  It's an important issue.
[02:10:25.271 --> 02:10:28.674]  As this story develops, we learn more and more and more.
[02:10:29.154 --> 02:10:30.996]  There's dozens of cameras that caught this.
[02:10:31.036 --> 02:10:32.297]  We're only seeing snippets of it.
[02:10:32.677 --> 02:10:34.178]  What really happened that day?
[02:10:34.819 --> 02:10:37.440]  Well, I think you summed it up very accurately, Alex.
[02:10:37.521 --> 02:10:41.884]  It was a normal day for most of the students who came to school that day.
[02:10:41.904 --> 02:10:49.409]  And the way that Berkeley County is, is there are rural areas that are mostly, by African Americans, as you noted...
[02:10:50.649 --> 02:10:51.110]  We're good to go.
[02:10:51.130 --> 02:10:51.430]  I think?
[02:11:11.668 --> 02:11:13.730]  Yeah, it's like a lockdown of a prison or something.
[02:11:13.770 --> 02:11:16.011]  So what happened after that was the dogs came out.
[02:11:16.031 --> 02:11:16.852]  They did not clear the students.
[02:11:39.952 --> 02:11:47.536]  You've seen those handcuffs that they use on detainees in Iraq or in any of the places where the United States is abroad.
[02:11:48.217 --> 02:11:50.738]  Handcuffs of students, they were thrown to the ground.
[02:11:51.439 --> 02:11:55.201]  The dogs paroled the hall, snarling very close to the students' faces.
[02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:59.543]  Any student who just looked behind to see what was going on had a gun to the back of their head.
[02:12:00.504 --> 02:12:01.224]  Really tragic.
[02:12:01.965 --> 02:12:03.085]  They found no drugs.
[02:12:04.326 --> 02:12:07.928]  They didn't find anyone who had done drugs, and it all came because of
[02:12:08.527 --> 02:12:09.668]  Now, according to the Associated Press...
[02:12:20.058 --> 02:12:21.739]  And this is just some of the video that was seen.
[02:12:21.759 --> 02:12:22.980]  A lot of it wasn't caught on tape.
[02:12:23.601 --> 02:12:30.005]  The dog, this vicious German shepherd, began savaging the backpack.
[02:12:30.785 --> 02:12:34.948]  It grabbed it, and we've got the video, starts shaking it viciously.
[02:12:35.208 --> 02:12:37.550]  We've all seen that in police training films on TV.
[02:12:37.950 --> 02:12:43.214]  I know I'd be really mad if my child had a gun put to his head and then had a German shepherd jumping on him.
[02:12:43.394 --> 02:12:44.535]  That is terrifying.
[02:12:44.795 --> 02:12:46.236]  I think that's what we can all relate to.
[02:12:46.256 --> 02:12:49.458]  There's some people who are canine lovers, and God bless them,
[02:12:50.259 --> 02:12:59.094]  When you have snarling dogs that are trained to attack, trained to be accomplices to police in their police activities, they're used to dealing with criminals.
[02:12:59.435 --> 02:12:59.935]  And of course...
[02:13:00.812 --> 02:13:13.979]  They're meant to subdue the criminals, and to use that on high school students aged 13 through 17, I think what shocks the imagination is any one of our children going through that.
[02:13:13.999 --> 02:13:17.701]  Well, I have to tell you, I'm not just saying this because two-thirds of the students singled out were black.
[02:13:18.101 --> 02:13:28.187]  I've seen film of South Africa in the 80s where they would have everybody line up on their knees and watching police dogs bite on people, and it's very akin to that.
[02:13:28.707 --> 02:13:50.381]  Well, what you said is very interesting, and what we looked at and what we found is, if you even think back to the 60s, the use of police dogs in those instances, but what shocks the conscience and what was very interesting was that not only black students were targeting, although this section of the hall was an entrance for the bus that was from a more rural and predominantly African-American area.
[02:13:50.401 --> 02:13:53.323]  So it just so happens that a lot of black students were there, and it was, okay.
[02:13:53.543 --> 02:13:53.823]  That's right.
[02:13:53.863 --> 02:13:55.404]  It was two-thirds, about two-thirds.
[02:13:55.424 --> 02:13:56.285]  There was about 107 students there.
[02:13:57.265 --> 02:14:02.548]  Two-thirds were black, about one-third were white, and it shouldn't have happened to any children.
[02:14:02.668 --> 02:14:09.211]  And it didn't seem that the barking dogs and the barking police were yelling at them, were singling out one group, they were just attacking basically everybody.
[02:14:09.491 --> 02:14:20.457]  Well, they definitely had guns to everyone's heads, and what is very interesting, or everyone, black and white, we need to really see what those cameras show, and we're in the age where
[02:14:20.945 --> 02:14:25.069]  Fortunately, we have the ability to see what happened and not just have the accounts of students.
[02:14:25.389 --> 02:14:32.856]  We all know that the cameras don't lie, but on that particular day, not only were there school cameras, there were police filming the procedure as well.
[02:14:33.781 --> 02:14:38.646]  There's been a Freedom of Information Act request to the police to try to get that as well.
[02:14:39.107 --> 02:14:41.510]  I was reading the police were trying to block that release.
[02:14:42.030 --> 02:14:45.754]  They were, and of course, why would you block something unless you had something to hide?
[02:14:45.894 --> 02:14:47.976]  Yeah, that's what they always tell us.
[02:14:48.837 --> 02:14:49.578]  That's very true.
[02:14:49.638 --> 02:14:51.100]  And we think in today's society...
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:55.845]  If what you're doing is proper, then you should be able to show what you did under the light of day.
[02:14:56.185 --> 02:14:59.288]  And if it passes constitutional muster, then there's nothing really to be worried about.
[02:14:59.308 --> 02:15:05.334]  Well, and the government constitutionally has a higher standard because they have the force, the suit.
[02:15:05.474 --> 02:15:07.797]  What's being alleged here, I think the evidence is clear.
[02:15:08.497 --> 02:15:14.941]  And how are you going to win this thing and punish these people so they don't do it again?
[02:15:15.021 --> 02:15:16.822]  Because this is precedent setting.
[02:15:17.282 --> 02:15:21.645]  I studied this, sir, and I want you to know, if you want me to get you to the info, my office can do it.
[02:15:21.945 --> 02:15:23.446]  This is going on all the time.
[02:15:23.766 --> 02:15:26.828]  It just so happened that we got the video in this case.
[02:15:26.868 --> 02:15:28.449]  So this is happening all over the place.
[02:15:28.769 --> 02:15:33.031]  Well, we do hope this is a precedent that can prevent this from happening across the United States.
[02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:34.052]  But interestingly enough...
[02:15:34.847 --> 02:15:37.889]  The main thing we're looking for in this suit is injunctive relief.
[02:15:37.949 --> 02:15:53.497]  And as you're familiar with the federal courts, judges and juries have the ability, judges in particular, not only to award damages in the monetary sense, but also to declare certain actions unconstitutional and to say things like this shouldn't happen again.
[02:15:53.858 --> 02:15:57.880]  And that's examining it under the microscope of the Constitution.
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:02.762]  Yeah, I want to commend your lawsuit, your class action suit, for stating that it's...
[02:16:04.183 --> 02:16:14.105]  Trying to have an injunction blocking further raids like this because, I mean, folks, this would traumatize anybody, and I know it would outrage me.
[02:16:14.985 --> 02:16:28.488]  Now, you have their own, according to the Associated Press, their own guidelines, and these are national guidelines but also local guidelines, not to let dogs alert on people who are wearing the backpacks, but they did this.
[02:16:28.748 --> 02:16:30.849]  Precisely, precisely, and that's one of the most,
[02:16:31.403 --> 02:16:33.584]  Damaging bits of evidence to come out thus far.
[02:16:34.125 --> 02:16:41.529]  Whenever an institution, particularly a governmental entity, promulgates rules, regulations, that's meant to protect the students.
[02:16:41.949 --> 02:16:49.333]  And also it's meant to set a guideline for teachers, administrators, officers to follow if they enter the school.
[02:16:49.893 --> 02:16:56.177]  When police officers or anyone in a position of power violates their own guidelines,
[02:16:56.667 --> 02:17:04.291]  That goes against the very protections that we hope to have if we send our children off to somewhere safe and somewhere they're supposed to be protected.
[02:17:04.391 --> 02:17:06.992]  So you hit the nail on the head earlier on.
[02:17:07.612 --> 02:17:08.873]  What if a gun had gone off?
[02:17:09.213 --> 02:17:10.474]  And lawsuits aren't about what if.
[02:17:10.534 --> 02:17:12.395]  It's about not letting this happen again.
[02:17:12.415 --> 02:17:21.179]  Well, sir, your staff can dig up hundreds of cases in the last decade, a bunch of cases right here in Texas where they're shooting cops and students doing this.
[02:17:21.679 --> 02:17:27.446]  There's just no video of it, but I think that'll be useful in court to show the danger of what could have taken place.
[02:17:27.486 --> 02:17:28.667]  Well, I think that's very important.
[02:17:28.707 --> 02:17:36.236]  What you see, and I don't want to bring it back to race all the time, but if you think about the Rodney King video or some of the other videos we see where someone's...
[02:17:36.576 --> 02:17:41.298]  Well, we're also training our children how to be prisoners, and they're violating their rights.
[02:17:41.358 --> 02:17:47.500]  I mean, I'm sure you've heard about the articles where the schools are putting cameras in the bathrooms now.
[02:18:05.186 --> 02:18:05.847]  Very much so.
[02:18:05.907 --> 02:18:07.790]  And it breeds a mistrust of authority.
[02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:13.777]  I think what most police look for when they walk their beats or they patrol a neighborhood is they want a trust.
[02:18:13.858 --> 02:18:17.923]  They want a connection, a relationship that's positive with the young people and that
[02:18:18.291 --> 02:18:20.873]  That's true, and Alex, I think a very important point that also has been brought up
[02:18:41.869 --> 02:18:45.831]  It's a lot of people looking at these videos are adults and people looking at CNN.
[02:18:46.151 --> 02:18:49.073]  Most teenagers don't usually look at CNN, but some do.
[02:18:49.433 --> 02:18:52.874]  But the people who went through this are aged 13 through 17.
[02:18:53.415 --> 02:19:03.820]  And I think when you look at the context of the effect it has on the students and why we want to prevent things like this is children at that age are definitely at a more sensitive point in their lives than we adults.
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:08.042]  And though we might have some background or some knowledge of how police are, we generally
[02:19:09.063 --> 02:19:11.806]  Yeah, police are out giving themselves bad PR nationwide
[02:19:23.599 --> 02:19:26.360]  And they need the support of the citizenry.
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:27.860]  Stay there, Dwayne Green.
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:29.041]  We're really honored to have you.

[02:19:41.344 --> 02:19:43.385]  Also callers in Florida, Illinois, you name it.
[02:19:43.705 --> 02:19:44.305]  We'll be right back.

[02:21:06.256 --> 02:21:13.259]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.

[02:21:46.328 --> 02:21:51.352]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[02:21:51.732 --> 02:21:54.494]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[02:21:54.934 --> 02:21:57.816]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[02:21:58.196 --> 02:22:05.321]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[02:22:05.842 --> 02:22:06.722]  That's recovery?
[02:22:07.343 --> 02:22:12.547]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[02:22:12.947 --> 02:22:14.488]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[02:22:15.165 --> 02:22:17.926]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.

[02:22:44.128 --> 02:22:47.631]  I have been on collagenate for three months now and I've lost 40 pounds.
[02:22:48.111 --> 02:22:49.572]  40 pounds in three months?
[02:22:50.033 --> 02:22:55.597]  Ann's another listener who took my advice and lost weight the safe and healthy way with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:22:55.877 --> 02:22:58.099]  I heard about collagenate through radio station.
[02:22:58.439 --> 02:23:00.501]  I've gone down about three dress sizes.
[02:23:00.701 --> 02:23:01.181]  I feel good.
[02:23:01.221 --> 02:23:01.842]  I have energy.
[02:23:02.022 --> 02:23:03.083]  I was really tired before.
[02:23:03.123 --> 02:23:06.025]  I didn't have a lot of energy and I've got three kids, so it was kind of hard to keep up with them.
[02:23:06.165 --> 02:23:07.246]  But now I feel wonderful.
[02:23:07.426 --> 02:23:08.807]  I've had people notice quite a bit.
[02:23:08.867 --> 02:23:10.609]  They're coming up to me and they're saying, what have you done?
[02:23:10.669 --> 02:23:11.950]  And I went on collagenate.
[02:23:12.490 --> 02:23:15.680]  I have been on Collagenate for three months now and I've lost 40 pounds.
[02:23:16.246 --> 02:23:17.847]  Wow, 40 pounds.
[02:23:18.248 --> 02:23:22.051]  This was Ann's personal experience while taking Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[02:23:22.231 --> 02:23:24.553]  Why don't you see what Collagenate can do for you?
[02:23:24.833 --> 02:23:26.314]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:23:26.334 --> 02:23:26.595]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:23:26.615 --> 02:23:27.916]  And hey, get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.
[02:23:27.956 --> 02:23:28.716]  You've got to call now, 1-800-622-8446.
[02:23:28.736 --> 02:23:29.197]  Again, that's 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:23:46.244 --> 02:23:48.985]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:23:49.005 --> 02:23:52.906]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:54.966 --> 02:23:56.627]  It's not about left and right, folks.
[02:23:56.667 --> 02:23:58.027]  It's about right and wrong.
[02:23:58.067 --> 02:23:59.607]  The old cliche rings true.
[02:24:00.468 --> 02:24:03.589]  All over the country, police are being trained that we're basically their enemy.
[02:24:04.069 --> 02:24:05.129]  We don't have any rights.
[02:24:06.212 --> 02:24:06.813]  We're good to go.
[02:24:06.833 --> 02:24:07.373]  We're good to go.
[02:24:29.321 --> 02:24:32.123]  Hey, how would those police like this happen to their children?
[02:24:32.504 --> 02:24:35.886]  This is not America when this type of garbage goes on.
[02:24:35.906 --> 02:24:39.649]  Now, I don't mean to get angry, but watching the film just disgusts me.
[02:24:40.470 --> 02:24:41.751]  Better never do that to my children.
[02:24:41.771 --> 02:24:42.632]  That's all I can say.
[02:24:42.952 --> 02:24:47.996]  Dwayne Green is one of the lawyers leading up the case on this class action suit.
[02:24:48.537 --> 02:24:50.438]  And, Dwayne, we've got a bunch of callers here.
[02:24:50.638 --> 02:24:53.601]  Charlie in South Carolina, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:24:53.641 --> 02:24:54.061]  Go ahead.
[02:24:55.669 --> 02:24:58.870]  Alex, I was calling about another incident that happened over here.
[02:24:58.890 --> 02:24:59.891]  Did you hear about that one?
[02:25:00.671 --> 02:25:01.172]  Which one?
[02:25:01.592 --> 02:25:07.554]  About the shoot-up up there in Abbeville County near the Georgia line.
[02:25:07.995 --> 02:25:08.515]  What happened?
[02:25:08.835 --> 02:25:16.258]  Well, they took some of the land from them people, and they didn't pay them any money, so they were protesting it.
[02:25:16.739 --> 02:25:18.319]  Well, actually, I don't know the whole story.
[02:25:18.479 --> 02:25:21.141]  Anyway, they barged the door down, broke the door down.
[02:25:21.181 --> 02:25:22.021]  There was a shoot-out.
[02:25:23.061 --> 02:25:24.322]  Two deputies got shot.
[02:25:26.256 --> 02:25:30.299]  I've seen the kid, the younger guy, the father was 74.
[02:25:30.459 --> 02:25:34.282]  He got seriously shot up, and the sun was on.
[02:25:34.442 --> 02:25:37.825]  Okay, Charlie, do you have any comments for our guest?
[02:25:38.405 --> 02:25:51.015]  The only thing I've got to say is don't compare that school with Rodney King, because Rodney King was nothing but a criminal, and he went after the police, first of all, like the other guy just recently.
[02:25:51.255 --> 02:25:52.716]  There's no comparisons.
[02:25:53.197 --> 02:25:53.917]  I appreciate that.
[02:25:53.957 --> 02:25:56.598]  I don't mean to compare the instance to Rodney King.
[02:25:56.618 --> 02:25:58.338]  He's talking about the power of film.
[02:25:58.598 --> 02:25:59.498]  The film, exactly.
[02:25:59.538 --> 02:26:04.999]  I was just showing that something that happened would not have made such an impact on the national conscience.
[02:26:05.099 --> 02:26:08.820]  Well, you ought to go after these people for terrorism, because they terrorize the people.
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:12.420]  Isn't that a new law now, terrorism?
[02:26:13.201 --> 02:26:14.681]  Thanks, Charles.
[02:26:15.721 --> 02:26:20.602]  There's a lot of new rules under the Patriot Act, but we're looking at just basic assault, battery, false arrests,
[02:26:20.996 --> 02:26:32.103]  Some of the causes of action that have been named in the complaint, and there's precedent out there that a police officer may be liable for assault if he or she uses greater force than necessary under the circumstances.
[02:26:32.123 --> 02:26:39.087]  Hey, I guarantee you, if you put a cop down, put a gun to their head, had a police dog bite on their uniform, you'd be charged with assault.
[02:26:39.887 --> 02:26:43.229]  Let's talk to Frank in West Virginia.
[02:26:43.249 --> 02:26:44.270]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:44.650]  Go ahead.
[02:26:45.410 --> 02:26:46.710]  Hello, thank you for taking my call.
[02:26:46.750 --> 02:26:49.431]  I just want to make a comment and ask you a question.
[02:26:49.491 --> 02:26:50.931]  I've got inside information.
[02:26:50.971 --> 02:27:01.873]  Here in West Virginia, police that are patrolling the schools under the, I believe that would be the Safe Schools Act, where a parent can't even walk into a school, go to the office.
[02:27:01.893 --> 02:27:06.254]  They have to ring the doorbell and buzz in before they can open into school for them.
[02:27:07.854 --> 02:27:13.435]  They've been trained that if there is any kind of a problem, such as an in-school shooting,
[02:27:14.421 --> 02:27:23.565]  Yes, and it makes no sense, but I'm sure they'll have some kind of rationale for it, just as they have a rationale for Columbine and all the other things that they're doing to violate people's rights.
[02:27:23.605 --> 02:27:27.147]  Now, somebody who has their child in a public school, I don't understand why...
[02:27:43.895 --> 02:27:48.296]  They would allow somebody else to care for their safety.
[02:27:48.856 --> 02:28:01.238]  I told one police officer if I had a child in a school, and I don't, but if I did and I knew of a murderer being in there, I'd certainly go in there and there wouldn't be anybody stopping me.
[02:28:01.258 --> 02:28:02.019]  Well, take Columbine.
[02:28:02.039 --> 02:28:03.779]  They sat out there for four hours.
[02:28:04.479 --> 02:28:04.739]  Right.
[02:28:05.039 --> 02:28:06.419]  Let me get a comment from our guest.
[02:28:06.439 --> 02:28:07.280]  We're almost out of time.
[02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:09.120]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:28:09.662 --> 02:28:25.337]  Yes, the important thing, and I think you raise a very good issue, Carla, the issue is whether or not there's a reasonable fear by the police that there are weapons in the school or there's a murderer or what have you, and what are the means you go about to affect whatever your goals are.
[02:28:26.177 --> 02:28:33.224]  In the instance where there's a suspicion of drugs, which is to be distinguished from deadly weapons, or someone who's known to be a murderer,
[02:28:33.695 --> 02:28:34.135]  I think so.
[02:28:52.512 --> 02:28:53.453]  Yes, that was the rationale.
[02:29:11.227 --> 02:29:14.870]  And we fear for our lives so much, we're going to use that as a rationale.
[02:29:14.930 --> 02:29:16.271]  All right, we're out of time.
[02:29:17.211 --> 02:29:18.352]  Frank, we're going to let our guests go.
[02:29:18.372 --> 02:29:21.074]  We'll come back with Jack and Mike and Chris.
[02:29:21.995 --> 02:29:26.938]  Sir, I want to thank you, Dwayne Green, and I hope to have you back up as the case develops.
[02:29:27.178 --> 02:29:28.179]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:29:28.199 --> 02:29:29.180]  Appreciate it.
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:30.281]  Well, you're doing a good thing.
[02:29:30.341 --> 02:29:31.021]  We wish you well.
[02:29:31.061 --> 02:29:32.042]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:29:35.885 --> 02:29:36.785]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.286 --> 02:29:38.767]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.799 --> 02:29:42.581]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:45.724 --> 02:29:46.684]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.196 --> 02:30:06.502]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:30:06.682 --> 02:30:08.565]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[02:30:08.705 --> 02:30:15.775]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:30:15.976 --> 02:30:18.439]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:30:18.719 --> 02:30:21.400]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[02:30:21.540 --> 02:30:23.041]  Only this time it changed my life.
[02:30:23.321 --> 02:30:25.081]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[02:30:25.161 --> 02:30:27.442]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[02:30:27.462 --> 02:30:29.903]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[02:30:29.943 --> 02:30:32.664]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[02:30:32.844 --> 02:30:33.384]  Side effects?
[02:30:33.544 --> 02:30:35.825]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[02:30:35.965 --> 02:30:37.465]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[02:30:37.485 --> 02:30:37.685]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[02:30:37.806 --> 02:30:39.246]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:30:39.266 --> 02:30:39.746]  It worked for me.
[02:30:45.786 --> 02:30:48.528]  In fact, if you call and order their free Midas report, Midas Resources will pay you.
[02:31:11.693 --> 02:31:11.933]  That's 888-292-2709.
[02:31:12.013 --> 02:31:15.234]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[02:31:46.351 --> 02:31:48.313]  A good healthy heart is serious business.
[02:31:48.873 --> 02:31:56.579]  It's well known that heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in America today, a cause that in a lot of cases could have been prevented.
[02:31:57.079 --> 02:32:02.683]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to help improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[02:32:03.224 --> 02:32:12.491]  The all-natural ingredients in Cardivite drops and capsules may increase metabolism in heart muscle tissue, regulate heart rhythm, and improve oxygen and blood flow to the heart.
[02:32:13.095 --> 02:32:13.635]  We're good to go.
[02:32:34.096 --> 02:32:35.117]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:35.297 --> 02:32:36.557]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:32:57.785 --> 02:32:58.545]  That's right, folks.
[02:32:58.565 --> 02:33:00.566]  We've got about 26 and a half minutes left.
[02:33:00.606 --> 02:33:05.587]  We're going to take five more calls and launch into some of the news we haven't covered that's very important and recap top stories.
[02:33:06.087 --> 02:33:07.447]  Let's go to these calls quickly.
[02:33:07.467 --> 02:33:11.388]  We'll go to Jack and Mike and Chris and John and Alan.
[02:33:11.808 --> 02:33:12.669]  That'll be it today.
[02:33:13.469 --> 02:33:15.529]  Jack in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:33:15.569 --> 02:33:16.029]  Go ahead.
[02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:17.130]  Yes, sir.
[02:33:17.170 --> 02:33:24.771]  Mr. Jones, I just wanted to tell you and your listeners about an incident that happened to me here in Florida back during the last primary election.
[02:33:26.052 --> 02:33:26.612]  Here in Florida...
[02:33:27.856 --> 02:33:32.899]  Most of our elections are held in buildings or usually churches as close to a particular district.
[02:33:33.599 --> 02:33:34.780]  I walked into the building.
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:36.921]  At the front of the building there's two desks.
[02:33:37.602 --> 02:33:41.144]  The first thing the lady asked me says, are you a Democrat or are you a Republican?
[02:33:41.864 --> 02:33:43.185]  Well, I said, I'm neither one.
[02:33:43.225 --> 02:33:44.626]  I happen to be a Libertarian.
[02:33:45.186 --> 02:33:47.387]  She says, well, your name is not on the book.
[02:33:47.447 --> 02:33:48.808]  You cannot vote today.
[02:33:49.702 --> 02:33:50.743]  And I said, well, wait a minute.
[02:33:50.783 --> 02:33:51.203]  The U.S.
[02:33:51.243 --> 02:33:54.045]  Constitution guarantees me a right to vote.
[02:33:54.366 --> 02:33:57.428]  And she says, no, not in the state of Florida, it don't.
[02:33:57.548 --> 02:34:04.673]  If you do not have a candidate running on the ballot at that particular time, you cannot vote at that particular time.
[02:34:06.675 --> 02:34:09.297]  And so I just want to let you know what happened.
[02:34:10.023 --> 02:34:10.843]  At this particular time.
[02:34:11.083 --> 02:34:22.306]  Well, Florida has a hand-picked Bush campaign contributor company that collates the names, throws people off that have different first names, same last names as any felon.
[02:34:22.326 --> 02:34:26.888]  So there's any felon with the name Jones, nobody named Jones can vote.
[02:34:26.968 --> 02:34:31.369]  That's an actual real case, and it's just how they operate.
[02:34:32.189 --> 02:34:36.190]  Yeah, but I was figuring, me being a registered voter, I'm registered in the state of Florida.
[02:34:36.210 --> 02:34:38.091]  Shouldn't I be able to vote at any time that vote is open?
[02:34:38.131 --> 02:34:38.811]  Yeah, you need to sue them.
[02:34:39.844 --> 02:34:51.695]  And, you know, even if you lose and just spend $1,000 with the filings and stuff over the period, lots of lawsuits will certainly give them a big problem.
[02:34:52.375 --> 02:34:53.436]  I imagine that would.
[02:34:53.877 --> 02:34:56.339]  What I'm going to do is we've got a primary coming up.
[02:34:56.719 --> 02:34:57.900]  I think it's in January.
[02:34:58.801 --> 02:35:05.267]  I think this time if they'll let me get away with it, I'm going to try to take my video camera with me along with my next-door neighbor.
[02:35:05.859 --> 02:35:11.481]  And see if I can film them or either get them on audio or something of this nature stating this.
[02:35:12.382 --> 02:35:14.583]  That way, you know, it's not my word against theirs.
[02:35:14.603 --> 02:35:18.484]  Well, usually the League of Women Voters runs elections, and we've caught them stealing elections.
[02:35:18.544 --> 02:35:23.326]  They're lobbying that there be no paper ballots with the new Diebold and other voting machines.
[02:35:23.366 --> 02:35:29.229]  I mean, it's just the average person isn't involved in voting, period, or how it even works.
[02:35:29.629 --> 02:35:31.890]  That's why we're losing our right to vote in this country.
[02:35:32.541 --> 02:35:33.321]  I know, I know.
[02:35:33.421 --> 02:35:38.263]  And radio programs like yourself here is what's helping people to wake up.
[02:35:38.323 --> 02:35:42.865]  And I'm glad that you have undertook this massive undertaking.
[02:35:43.305 --> 02:35:47.106]  And I'm sure your research crew there has to be outstanding to be able to come up with these.
[02:35:47.126 --> 02:35:48.607]  Well, you're looking at the research crew.
[02:35:48.667 --> 02:35:48.927]  I just...
[02:35:49.577 --> 02:35:56.783]  I've been studying the globalists for years, and I research the news, and I know what the globalist battle plan is, so I know what their activities are going to be.
[02:35:57.123 --> 02:35:58.064]  Thanks for the call, Jack.
[02:35:58.564 --> 02:35:59.645]  I'm sorry that happened to you.
[02:35:59.985 --> 02:36:01.487]  Mike in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:36:01.547 --> 02:36:02.007]  Go ahead.
[02:36:02.347 --> 02:36:02.628]  Hey, Alex.
[02:36:02.668 --> 02:36:02.988]  How you doing?
[02:36:03.008 --> 02:36:04.249]  I have a question for you, Alex.
[02:36:04.409 --> 02:36:06.371]  I haven't been able to listen to your show.
[02:36:06.391 --> 02:36:09.413]  I've been out of town for a couple of weeks, and I have a question for you.
[02:36:09.433 --> 02:36:11.054]  I don't know if you've even touched base on this.
[02:36:13.096 --> 02:36:20.082]  Lately, my mom's heard this on a couple of the Christian stations locally here in the Chicago area, and I've actually read it in the newspaper.
[02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:21.781]  What's your take on that, Alex?
[02:36:49.211 --> 02:37:01.901]  We know that official government documents from Canada, the U.S., England, Australia call for engineering superflues to kill the population to create fear and to force people into taking flu shots.
[02:37:02.001 --> 02:37:09.626]  They then add other garbage to that can sterilize people, attacks the brain, causes an IQ reduction.
[02:37:09.646 --> 02:37:10.927]  I mean, they've been caught doing this.
[02:37:11.528 --> 02:37:15.551]  Two years ago, the federal government dug up
[02:37:16.215 --> 02:37:17.176]  We're good to go.
[02:37:32.698 --> 02:37:32.878]  Right.
[02:37:32.898 --> 02:37:33.018]  Right.
[02:37:33.039 --> 02:37:33.139]  Right.
[02:37:33.159 --> 02:37:33.359]  Right.
[02:37:33.379 --> 02:37:33.519]  Right.
[02:37:51.733 --> 02:37:52.934]  Look at the smallpox shot.
[02:37:52.954 --> 02:37:54.075]  Look at the anthrax shot.
[02:37:54.155 --> 02:37:58.198]  It's the government setting a precedent to put things in your body forcibly.
[02:37:58.579 --> 02:38:06.084]  They had troops show up in Mesa, Arizona last year and just say, Okay, kids, we've got those that haven't had shots from your shot records.
[02:38:06.164 --> 02:38:06.685]  Line up.
[02:38:06.765 --> 02:38:08.726]  The Army's going to give you shots.
[02:38:08.746 --> 02:38:10.068]  That was in the Arizona Republic.
[02:38:10.208 --> 02:38:10.408]  Right.
[02:38:10.448 --> 02:38:13.470]  It's problem, reaction, solution, Alex, is what it is with the shots.
[02:38:13.770 --> 02:38:15.492]  Yeah, I wouldn't take any of their shots.
[02:38:15.572 --> 02:38:16.753]  No, absolutely not, Alex.
[02:38:16.773 --> 02:38:18.034]  But I think the danger is out there.
[02:38:18.094 --> 02:38:20.516]  It's kind of scary if the government has done what you had...
[02:38:21.016 --> 02:38:21.177]  Right.
[02:38:31.534 --> 02:38:33.516]  And normally it's the young, the old, or the infirm.
[02:38:33.936 --> 02:38:37.178]  If they're saying it's going to go up 50, 100,000, that is a huge increase.
[02:38:37.198 --> 02:38:40.841]  If they're talking about millions now, that is very, very scary.
[02:38:40.861 --> 02:38:42.362]  And, yes, I have those articles here.
[02:38:43.042 --> 02:38:50.367]  And, look, they couldn't get us to take the smallpox shot, couldn't get the states to pass that, couldn't get the police and firefighters and medical workers to take it.
[02:38:50.568 --> 02:38:52.389]  So now SARS is coming.
[02:38:52.649 --> 02:38:55.251]  We're going to have to round you up and put you in sports stadiums.
[02:38:55.651 --> 02:38:57.573]  That was the New York Times on Monday.
[02:38:57.633 --> 02:39:00.835]  It's all about the military has to get involved.
[02:39:01.075 --> 02:39:02.736]  We have to federalize.
[02:39:02.776 --> 02:39:05.138]  We have to arrest lots of people.
[02:39:05.238 --> 02:39:10.002]  It's just suddenly this crisis is here and Homeland Security is going to help.
[02:39:10.542 --> 02:39:10.763]  Yep.
[02:39:11.183 --> 02:39:12.884]  Alex, I'm going to send you a newspaper clipping.
[02:39:12.964 --> 02:39:17.528]  I just sent it to the 2001 South Lamar because I didn't get the chance to talk to your guest.
[02:39:18.041 --> 02:39:29.365]  But about a month ago, here locally in the town I live in, they had six police departments in the surrounding areas going to the high school, and they had canine units and everything doing drug searches in the high school unannounced.
[02:39:29.425 --> 02:39:32.246]  They said it would bug up people because the parents were very upset about it.
[02:39:32.266 --> 02:39:38.809]  Yeah, no, what they've done is, see, the next 50 times you hear about it, we'll get more desensitized until it's no big deal to us.
[02:39:38.849 --> 02:39:41.330]  We're being trained, all of us, even if we hate it,
[02:39:41.810 --> 02:39:42.390]  To accept it.
[02:39:42.991 --> 02:39:49.055]  This stuff of putting kids down on the ground, putting guns to their heads just during drills has been going on for four or five years.
[02:39:49.935 --> 02:39:51.816]  And so, yes, this is going on everywhere.
[02:39:51.856 --> 02:39:53.137]  But go ahead and send me the clipping.
[02:39:53.437 --> 02:39:53.998]  All right, Alex.
[02:39:54.018 --> 02:39:55.459]  Thanks a lot for the show there.
[02:39:55.579 --> 02:39:55.879]  You bet.
[02:39:55.899 --> 02:39:56.619]  I appreciate you.
[02:39:56.980 --> 02:40:01.062]  And the address to write to me is 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:40:11.873 --> 02:40:16.457]  3,001 South Lamar, Austin, Texas, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:40:16.637 --> 02:40:20.599]  And so it's not DOS, it's TRACE, 3,001.
[02:40:22.081 --> 02:40:32.528]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Kentucky, and then John in Tennessee, and that's it for calls.
[02:40:33.209 --> 02:40:34.409]  Chris in Kentucky, go ahead.
[02:40:34.830 --> 02:40:35.410]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:40:36.191 --> 02:40:37.171]  You're absolutely right.
[02:40:37.292 --> 02:40:39.093]  It's very much what I wanted to talk about.
[02:40:39.113 --> 02:40:40.594]  I was going to ask your guest a question, but
[02:40:41.195 --> 02:40:45.058]  They have been doing newscasts here how the police are walking around the public schools.
[02:40:45.238 --> 02:40:46.439]  I work part-time in a public school.
[02:40:46.459 --> 02:40:48.541]  We don't have any there yet, but I know it's coming.
[02:40:48.902 --> 02:40:49.882]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:40:49.902 --> 02:40:50.923]  This is the conditioning.
[02:40:51.043 --> 02:40:56.488]  See, they're going to be nice, and then they're going to condition you to do all this, and then they're going to surprise them and say, this is okay.
[02:40:56.588 --> 02:41:00.852]  They're going to dumb you down and just condition these kids to accept it.
[02:41:00.992 --> 02:41:03.654]  And it's like admitting the cops that this is all normal.
[02:41:04.153 --> 02:41:04.993]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:05.073 --> 02:41:06.794]  And the newscasts are saying this is okay.
[02:41:07.294 --> 02:41:09.434]  Well, it's to keep our children safe.
[02:41:09.794 --> 02:41:11.695]  And the terrorists out there, too.
[02:41:12.415 --> 02:41:15.675]  And, I mean, folks, get your kids out of the public schools.
[02:41:15.755 --> 02:41:21.577]  If your good parents out there are really, really concerned, get them out of the public schools and homeschool them, or private schools.
[02:41:21.617 --> 02:41:23.997]  Well, then I might not be able to have the jet boat.
[02:41:24.497 --> 02:41:28.038]  And they might not have that, and CPS will grab the kids, and you'll never see them again.
[02:41:28.058 --> 02:41:29.278]  Well, that's okay.
[02:41:29.298 --> 02:41:30.439]  You'll have the jet boat.
[02:41:30.759 --> 02:41:31.019]  Yeah.
[02:41:31.939 --> 02:41:32.479]  You'll have that.
[02:41:33.314 --> 02:41:34.355]  You'll have all the other stuff.
[02:41:34.495 --> 02:41:36.177]  It's just such good stuff.
[02:41:36.317 --> 02:41:37.998]  I mean, this is what the new America's about.
[02:41:39.119 --> 02:41:41.341]  Massive engineering to train us to be slaves.
[02:41:41.381 --> 02:41:41.922]  Thanks, Chris.
[02:41:42.122 --> 02:41:42.722]  Thank you, Jeff.
[02:41:43.083 --> 02:41:43.423]  You bet.
[02:41:43.463 --> 02:41:44.924]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:41:45.004 --> 02:41:45.885]  John, you're on the air.
[02:41:45.945 --> 02:41:46.406]  Go ahead.
[02:41:46.426 --> 02:41:52.411]  In Tennessee last week, a Scott County sheriff's deputy shot and killed another deputy in a drug raid.
[02:41:53.286 --> 02:41:55.328]  The house was a suspected meth lab.
[02:41:55.388 --> 02:41:56.569]  Yeah, I saw that article.
[02:41:56.909 --> 02:41:59.451]  Every two or three days, I read about a cop killing a cop.
[02:41:59.652 --> 02:42:04.095]  These SWAT teams, the statistical biggest danger is your own cops!
[02:42:04.436 --> 02:42:05.576]  So look in the mirror!
[02:42:05.857 --> 02:42:06.297]  Go ahead.
[02:42:06.357 --> 02:42:12.062]  Yeah, the killer was the son of the sheriff, so they instantly announced no criminal charges would be pressed.
[02:42:12.506 --> 02:42:16.730]  But they waited four days to tell the public that it was a deputy who did the killing.
[02:42:17.070 --> 02:42:17.830]  Well, you're lucky.
[02:42:17.871 --> 02:42:21.574]  In Austin, when cops kill cops, they just frame whoever's nearby.
[02:42:21.594 --> 02:42:26.978]  Yeah, somehow the people fled and were able to tell their version of the story before that happened.
[02:42:28.660 --> 02:42:39.809]  Now, Desoxyn, D-E-S-O-X-Y-N, is a prescription drug for methamphetamine used for ADD for children, but it's safer than Ritalin because there's no cow milk in it.
[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:50.067]  Now, in September in Tennessee, a SWAT team shot two innocent students at a college and killed the person feeding them free pizza and holding them hostage.
[02:42:50.727 --> 02:42:52.529]  That was Dyersburg Community College.
[02:42:52.569 --> 02:42:53.650]  Yeah, I saw that, too.
[02:42:53.690 --> 02:42:55.111]  Yeah, that's a scourge.
[02:42:55.511 --> 02:42:58.093]  Hey, cops, you know, we don't have to fight you.
[02:42:58.113 --> 02:42:59.194]  You're just killing yourselves.
[02:42:59.234 --> 02:42:59.714]  Go ahead.
[02:42:59.774 --> 02:43:00.215]  Keep it up.
[02:43:00.295 --> 02:43:01.135]  I'm sad about it.
[02:43:01.616 --> 02:43:04.018]  You're your biggest own enemy.
[02:43:04.238 --> 02:43:06.780]  Well, I want to say something about Rodney Glenn King.
[02:43:07.544 --> 02:43:11.987]  His name is actually Glenn King, not Rodney King, so the news couldn't even get that right.
[02:43:12.547 --> 02:43:15.308]  He was nearly beat to death over a bogus speeding ticket.
[02:43:16.249 --> 02:43:19.491]  Speeding tickets are civil summons to civil court.
[02:43:19.611 --> 02:43:23.913]  King was driving the world's slowest car, a Korean Hyundai Accel.
[02:43:24.393 --> 02:43:33.278]  The California troopers were a husband and wife team, and King pulled up behind them on a freeway off-ramp, so the cops used only their rearview mirror.
[02:43:33.838 --> 02:43:36.780]  No radar was used, and that bogus ticket killed 60 people.
[02:43:42.913 --> 02:43:48.036]  Well, certainly it can be handled better, but they've got to get the police where they're the enemies of the people.
[02:43:48.756 --> 02:43:50.657]  And I would just tell police, don't be part of it.
[02:43:51.018 --> 02:43:56.821]  Well, they allege King was high on crack and all that stuff, and he wasn't.
[02:43:56.902 --> 02:43:58.443]  It turned out even that was a lie.
[02:44:00.124 --> 02:44:01.965]  Well, I mean, King has been in a lot of trouble.
[02:44:02.005 --> 02:44:03.206]  He does.
[02:44:03.246 --> 02:44:04.106]  He's kind of an idiot.
[02:44:04.546 --> 02:44:06.868]  Sure, but the police were more of a criminal than King.
[02:44:08.348 --> 02:44:09.829]  Well, I just know this.
[02:44:11.190 --> 02:44:12.471]  We're in trouble as a country.
[02:44:13.452 --> 02:44:17.154]  And we're going to have to wake up and stand up and speak out against this.
[02:44:17.835 --> 02:44:19.275]  We have to have our voices heard.
[02:44:19.356 --> 02:44:20.056]  We're the people.
[02:44:20.136 --> 02:44:20.917]  It's our country.
[02:44:21.377 --> 02:44:22.258]  They work for us.
[02:44:22.398 --> 02:44:23.398]  We don't work for them.
[02:44:23.658 --> 02:44:30.623]  Well, here in Knoxville, our own city government sued its own employees for racketeering an organized crime last week.
[02:44:31.544 --> 02:44:33.165]  They filed a case in state court.
[02:44:33.925 --> 02:44:44.290]  I don't know about Knoxville, but about three years ago, and I read this article probably 20 times on air, I couldn't believe it, there were a bunch of articles in local newscasts, but the Washington Times had a three-part series.
[02:44:55.954 --> 02:45:01.541]  Where the police, in uniform, own the towing companies, you know, the lieutenants do.
[02:45:02.142 --> 02:45:12.015]  They will pull up, they were videotaped by a local news team in an investigation, pulling into a McDonald's, they stole a dozen cars, a man ran out and said, I'm parked in a normal parking spot.
[02:45:12.576 --> 02:45:14.018]  They pulled a gun on him and said...
[02:45:14.867 --> 02:45:19.812]  Go back in the McDonald's and they take them to a chop shop and publicly steal cars.
[02:45:19.892 --> 02:45:22.474]  I mean, it's just, and they keep doing it.
[02:45:22.515 --> 02:45:24.456]  It's, we got machine guns, you don't.
[02:45:24.917 --> 02:45:25.457]  Shut up!
[02:45:25.858 --> 02:45:37.269]  Well, Giuliani, Mayor Giuliani's brother ran the largest, or uncle ran the largest car theft cartel in New York State, according to the Village Voice and the New York Daily News.
[02:45:39.651 --> 02:45:39.971]  I know.
[02:45:40.011 --> 02:45:41.312]  They're just a bunch of mobsters.
[02:45:41.412 --> 02:45:42.212]  It's just incredible.
[02:45:42.252 --> 02:45:43.413]  There are leaders.
[02:45:43.453 --> 02:45:45.714]  There are saviors.
[02:45:45.774 --> 02:45:46.935]  They keep us safe.
[02:45:46.955 --> 02:45:47.615]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:48.696 --> 02:45:49.656]  It's just disgusting.
[02:45:49.696 --> 02:45:50.236]  Listen to this.
[02:45:50.256 --> 02:45:51.497]  This is the Patriot Act, folks.
[02:45:51.517 --> 02:45:55.499]  They're going after topless bars, county commissioners with it for zoning laws.
[02:45:56.399 --> 02:45:58.240]  They're going after marijuana dealers.
[02:45:58.981 --> 02:46:03.823]  And this is out of the Lansing State Journal on InfoWars.com.
[02:46:05.704 --> 02:46:07.365]  It says, getting a loan...
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:09.923]  Big Brother wants to know.
[02:46:10.543 --> 02:46:14.029]  And this was the writer, Mr. Schindler, writing about this for the newspaper.
[02:46:14.429 --> 02:46:18.075]  When a credit union official told Bill Simpson that the U.S.
[02:46:18.135 --> 02:46:21.099]  Attorney General was interested in his son's $8,000 car loan,
[02:46:23.287 --> 02:46:29.433]  Simpson wondered, half-whimsically, is his son should have bought a Chevy instead of a Honda?
[02:46:29.493 --> 02:46:39.243]  My guess, Simpson said, is that since it's a foreign car, maybe John Ashcroft thinks my son is going to load it with weapons of mass destruction and distribute them to Al-Qaeda cells around the country.
[02:46:39.723 --> 02:46:44.228]  Bill Simpson and his son, Ian Simpson, are members of the Eaton County Education Credit Union.
[02:46:44.608 --> 02:46:46.330]  Ian recently applied for a car loan.
[02:46:47.030 --> 02:46:49.032]  Which was going to the local car dealer.
[02:46:49.513 --> 02:46:50.894]  Bill went along to supervise.
[02:46:50.934 --> 02:46:55.679]  At some point in the process, the loan officer started talking about federal government's interest in the transaction.
[02:46:56.140 --> 02:46:59.543]  I thought he was joking, Bill Simpson said, but he assured me he wasn't.
[02:47:00.364 --> 02:47:01.505]  And it says, new order.
[02:47:01.625 --> 02:47:04.988]  Of course, the government's concern has nothing to do with the brand of the vehicle.
[02:47:05.089 --> 02:47:07.191]  It has everything to do with the terrorist attacks of September 11th.
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:10.922]  Kenneth Hubber is treasurer and manager of Simpsons Credit Union.
[02:47:10.942 --> 02:47:16.825]  He explained how two post-September 11th events changed things for American financial institutions.
[02:47:18.065 --> 02:47:26.690]  The first was President Bush's executive order requiring all financial institutions to block all assets held in the names of individuals or organizations identified as being associated with terrorist groups.
[02:47:27.010 --> 02:47:35.935]  The second event was the USA Patriot Act passed by Congress, a provision that law requires financial transactions to know who they are doing business with.
[02:47:36.798 --> 02:47:38.579]  So, see, everybody being spied on.
[02:47:38.599 --> 02:47:42.822]  This requires extra verification of identity of people opening new accounts.
[02:47:43.843 --> 02:47:48.366]  Folks, I would tell you that illegal aliens walk up with no ID and get bank accounts.
[02:47:49.126 --> 02:47:53.849]  The big apartment complexes have had their managers told at big corporate meetings.
[02:47:54.029 --> 02:48:05.977]  I mean, I have friends personally, folks, who manage big complexes, that illegals, no ID, no nothing, let ten of them stay in the two-bedroom, but if it's an American citizen, they've got to jump through all the hoops.
[02:48:09.090 --> 02:48:10.211]  That's the new America, folks.
[02:48:12.232 --> 02:48:14.974]  And it's incredible.
[02:48:15.614 --> 02:48:17.956]  And it gets even worse.
[02:48:18.156 --> 02:48:24.360]  It talks about people going to restaurants being spied on.
[02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:24.720]  It says,
[02:48:37.609 --> 02:48:41.110]  It's really none of their business that we are borrowing money.
[02:48:41.150 --> 02:48:42.991]  He said it's really pretty scary.
[02:48:43.231 --> 02:48:43.851]  You bet it is.
[02:48:44.452 --> 02:48:49.533]  Folks, no more warrants, no more financial privacy, no more nothing.
[02:48:50.614 --> 02:48:53.095]  An act of terrorism is any misdemeanor, okay?
[02:48:53.535 --> 02:48:54.515]  Section 802.
[02:48:54.915 --> 02:48:56.056]  Section 802 of H.R.
[02:48:56.076 --> 02:48:56.056]  3162.
[02:48:56.096 --> 02:48:56.156]  And...
[02:49:00.649 --> 02:49:02.230]  They want to pass Patriot Act 2.
[02:49:02.270 --> 02:49:04.751]  They're already implementing Patriot Act 2 without passing it.
[02:49:05.231 --> 02:49:07.772]  This is the reality.
[02:49:08.692 --> 02:49:09.673]  And here's an article.
[02:49:09.793 --> 02:49:12.114]  China, you have to share banking information.
[02:49:12.494 --> 02:49:15.295]  The Mercury News, we're going to give them information on us.
[02:49:15.315 --> 02:49:16.716]  They're going to give us their information.
[02:49:17.376 --> 02:49:20.997]  That's out of the San Jose Mercury News.
[02:49:21.958 --> 02:49:29.721]  This is the type of country that we are now living in in this constitutional republic.
[02:49:30.777 --> 02:49:33.079]  And Israelis give a course in urban warfare.
[02:49:33.419 --> 02:49:38.722]  Taipei Times Israeli counterinsurgency specialists have been sent to Fort Bragg to teach U.S.
[02:49:38.742 --> 02:49:42.325]  Special Forces how to keep an unruly Iraqi population under control.
[02:49:42.845 --> 02:49:44.986]  They've been doing it for years, how to keep us under control.
[02:49:45.487 --> 02:49:47.268]  Israeli advisors are helping train U.S.
[02:49:47.288 --> 02:49:53.412]  Special Forces in aggressive counterinsurgency operations in Iraq, including the use of assassination squads against guerrilla leaders.
[02:49:54.275 --> 02:49:59.079]  And we read the article yesterday at the New York Times where they kidnapped people's children.
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:05.045]  Terrorist suspect children are being kidnapped and being held as hostages.
[02:50:05.105 --> 02:50:08.948]  Now, that's admitted by the Army colonel who gave the interview.
[02:50:09.869 --> 02:50:11.410]  Torture, they're telling us, is good.
[02:50:11.731 --> 02:50:13.292]  Kidnapping children is good.
[02:50:13.973 --> 02:50:16.555]  And police dogs jumping on your children is good.
[02:50:17.076 --> 02:50:18.557]  Putting guns to their head is good.
[02:50:19.292 --> 02:50:21.854]  Having no freedom or no liberty is now good.
[02:50:22.314 --> 02:50:23.956]  No, it's not.
[02:50:24.336 --> 02:50:31.341]  Video cameras in school showers and bathrooms put there by the government, federally funded, is not freedom.
[02:50:33.243 --> 02:50:37.686]  I'm going to hit some other news I haven't covered and recap some of the top stories in this final five-minute segment.
[02:50:37.706 --> 02:50:41.309]  We're accelerating towards Infowars.com, the website.
[02:50:41.669 --> 02:50:42.930]  Please stay with us.
[02:50:43.010 --> 02:50:43.831]  Stay the course.
[02:50:45.785 --> 02:50:50.109]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.309 --> 02:50:54.713]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:54.873 --> 02:50:59.256]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:50:59.296 --> 02:51:00.638]  The New World Order.
[02:51:01.418 --> 02:51:02.400]  Can't emerge.
[02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:06.647]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:06.707 --> 02:51:13.658]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:13.799 --> 02:51:15.762]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.158 --> 02:51:26.482]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:26.762 --> 02:51:32.124]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:51:38.926 --> 02:51:39.126]  Oh, my...
[02:51:46.530 --> 02:51:51.234]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:51:51.375 --> 02:51:52.035]  Yes, it's true.
[02:51:52.055 --> 02:51:54.778]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.

[02:52:45.700 --> 02:52:46.680]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:52:47.060 --> 02:52:52.801]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:52:53.061 --> 02:52:58.182]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:52:58.522 --> 02:53:07.844]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:53:08.164 --> 02:53:13.105]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:53:13.445 --> 02:53:17.447]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:53:17.647 --> 02:53:22.449]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.

[02:55:02.725 --> 02:55:05.606]  The films are $25.95 apiece, all over two hours.
[02:55:06.066 --> 02:55:08.247]  Order three or more of any of the titles.
[02:55:08.267 --> 02:55:10.508]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[02:55:11.428 --> 02:55:16.350]  The new book is Ordered Out of Chaos, a lead-sponsored terror in the New World Order that I published by Paul Watson.
[02:55:16.731 --> 02:55:17.411]  It's excellent.
[02:55:18.482 --> 02:55:22.604]  Go to InfoWars.com to order or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.
[02:55:22.664 --> 02:55:25.825]  That's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704 or 1-888.
[02:55:34.275 --> 02:55:35.236]  253-3139.
[02:55:35.476 --> 02:55:37.819]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:46.147]  And your purchase also supports this show.
[02:55:46.547 --> 02:55:47.648]  They make great gifts.
[02:55:47.668 --> 02:55:51.352]  You're authorized to make copies of them for non-profit, not for sale purposes.
[02:55:51.672 --> 02:55:55.116]  My goal is to spread the word, and they're the best tool we've found to wake folks up.
[02:55:55.376 --> 02:55:56.177]  And they're amazing.
[02:55:56.217 --> 02:55:57.178]  You won't be disappointed.
[02:55:58.769 --> 02:56:01.610]  AP, Iraq to stop counting civilian dead.
[02:56:01.851 --> 02:56:08.014]  The White House has ordered the government there to not keep track of dead civilians killed by the U.S.
[02:56:08.034 --> 02:56:08.494]  military.
[02:56:09.034 --> 02:56:10.255]  Again, total tyranny, folks.
[02:56:10.295 --> 02:56:10.935]  Total cover-up.
[02:56:11.355 --> 02:56:13.376]  White House defends bid policy in Iraq.
[02:56:13.456 --> 02:56:14.837]  Oh, they won't allow bids, folks.
[02:56:15.117 --> 02:56:20.460]  The White House on Wednesday firmly denied, defended, excuse me, a new policy barring companies...
[02:56:21.115 --> 02:56:26.320]  ...from countries opposed to the Iraq War from bidding on the $18.6 billion in reconstruction contracts.
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:27.741]  James Baker, by the way, runs that.
[02:56:28.141 --> 02:56:29.983]  The Pentagon policy prevents companies from U.S.
[02:56:30.043 --> 02:56:36.008]  allies, such as France, Germany, and Canada, from bidding on those contracts because their governments oppose the U.S.-led war.
[02:56:36.288 --> 02:56:37.429]  That's a smokescreen, folks.
[02:56:37.549 --> 02:56:37.810]  U.S.
[02:56:37.870 --> 02:56:39.351]  companies don't even get the contracts.
[02:56:39.691 --> 02:56:44.035]  Only a handful do, like Bechtel and Dyncor and Halliburton.
[02:56:45.262 --> 02:56:45.842]  Listen to this.
[02:56:45.902 --> 02:56:46.923]  Imagine living in England.
[02:56:47.363 --> 02:56:50.365]  Jail cut for man who stabbed burglar to death.
[02:56:50.826 --> 02:56:51.766]  Oh, how gracious of them.
[02:56:52.167 --> 02:56:57.810]  A man jailed for five years for stabbing a burglar to death had his sentence cut to three years by a court of appeal today.
[02:56:58.211 --> 02:57:14.061]  The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Wolfe, ruled that although the jury had been right to find Barry Lee Hastings guilty of manslaughter at the old family trial in October last year, there were special circumstances which allowed him to cut the prison term.
[02:57:14.801 --> 02:57:25.007]  The father from Wood Green, North London, who launched his attack after finding Roger Williams in the home of his wife and children, is now likely to be released in three months' time.
[02:57:26.728 --> 02:57:27.569]  So think about this.
[02:57:27.589 --> 02:57:29.550]  They go, yeah, it's illegal to defend yourself.
[02:57:29.630 --> 02:57:31.071]  The Lord goes on to say that.
[02:57:31.251 --> 02:57:32.051]  The Lord.
[02:57:32.812 --> 02:57:38.355]  But, you know, he's already served a year or so in there, so we're going to let him out.
[02:57:39.456 --> 02:57:43.318]  Folks, they arrest people every time they defend themselves.
[02:57:44.056 --> 02:57:45.036]  I see it every week.
[02:57:45.896 --> 02:57:47.517]  That's what they want to do here, folks.
[02:57:47.557 --> 02:57:48.517]  That's what they want to do here.
[02:57:49.357 --> 02:57:50.418]  I'm not going to put up with it.
[02:57:50.758 --> 02:57:55.839]  The Supreme Court has upheld campaign destruction of First Amendment reform.
[02:57:57.059 --> 02:57:57.819]  Well, it really did.
[02:57:57.839 --> 02:58:01.240]  And so that's developed there.
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:05.741]  And Bush is cutting Taiwan loose, calling it the status quo.
[02:58:05.801 --> 02:58:06.721]  It's not the status quo.
[02:58:06.761 --> 02:58:08.362]  We have a treaty with them since 1949.
[02:58:10.037 --> 02:58:14.779]  Clinton could have never done this, but Bush the neocon, the whore of the New World Order can.
[02:58:15.239 --> 02:58:29.304]  The gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, missile-secret-selling creature continuing the New World Order policy of arming all our enemies to bring us into World War III, institute the national draft, and implement total martial law.
[02:58:29.764 --> 02:58:34.106]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow, 11 to 2, and I'll see you in Houston on Saturday.
[02:58:35.945 --> 02:58:39.426]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:58:39.706 --> 02:58:43.207]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:58:43.287 --> 02:58:47.228]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:58:47.449 --> 02:58:53.610]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:58:54.031 --> 02:59:01.933]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:59:02.353 --> 02:59:07.696]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:59:07.856 --> 02:59:11.617]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:59:11.998 --> 02:59:13.838]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:59:13.898 --> 02:59:16.080]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:59:16.300 --> 02:59:21.242]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
