[00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:06.056]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:15.209]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:16.950]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:18.752]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:20.233]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:21.875]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:26.179]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.863]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:33.505]  All right.
[00:00:41.972 --> 00:00:45.176]  Welcome back to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:06.140]  Got up at 7 this morning, and I am going to go over the news and have some guests on.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:18.048]  But next week, I'm going to do one of those September 11th shows where I don't take any calls for three hours, and I attempt to calmly go over all of the information that we cover in Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:31.952]  And, of course, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, my book, Descent into Tyranny, Watson's Book, Order Out of Chaos, all the evidence that's out there, the stuff that's posted in the 911 section of prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:36.114]  First off, I just keep getting requests for this, and I love it.
[00:01:36.134 --> 00:01:37.695]  It gets funnier every time I listen to it.
[00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:38.896]  It's scarier, too.
[00:01:39.597 --> 00:01:43.239]  There's Michael Corbin's Neocon Star, a takeoff on...
[00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:48.229]  A takeoff on OnStar, and this is where it's all going, so here it is.
[00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:57.959]  The following is an actual conversation between a NeoconStar operator and a subscriber in distress who is locked in her car and doesn't have the proper authorization to get out.
[00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.282]  With NeoconStar, help is just a satellite away.
[00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:06.790]  Neoconstar, how can I offer you great service today?
[00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.192]  Please help me, I'm trapped in my car.
[00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:11.133]  My retina scanner won't work.
[00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:12.494]  Just relax, sir.
[00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:14.356]  It's not sir, it's ma'am.
[00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:16.177]  Please hurry, it's hot in here.
[00:02:16.397 --> 00:02:21.201]  According to Admiral Poindexter's database, I have you at the Monsanto Mart on 6th Street.
[00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:21.601]  Right.
[00:02:21.902 --> 00:02:26.285]  I have a live shot of you from the Neoconstar observation blimp in your area.
[00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:27.646]  I'm an old lady.
[00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:31.009]  Alright, sir, looks like you have no outstanding warrants, so you're not a new
[00:02:34.138 --> 00:02:36.360]  Parking tickets in two counties.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.404]  We'll need you to slide your national ID card for a deduction before we can release you from the car.
[00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:45.626]  Slide it through the Neocon Star console now.
[00:02:45.886 --> 00:02:47.047]  But I can't find it.
[00:02:47.107 --> 00:02:48.168]  I'm looking everywhere.
[00:02:48.228 --> 00:02:50.329]  I can't find my national ID card.
[00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.591]  Sir, I'm going to send a home...
[00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:04.412]  Okay.
[00:03:05.013 --> 00:03:06.974]  I'll take the lethal injection, please.
[00:03:07.314 --> 00:03:09.676]  Thanks for using Neocon Star.
[00:03:10.497 --> 00:03:10.997]  All right.
[00:03:11.097 --> 00:03:12.939]  Thanks for using Neocon Star.
[00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.520]  I want to get Michael Corbin on the show to play more of those.
[00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:18.903]  Talk about his analysis of the New World Order.
[00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:22.566]  Maybe next week, because I probably should have done it this week.
[00:03:22.586 --> 00:03:23.827]  There's been so much other news.
[00:03:24.887 --> 00:03:27.169]  I should have all the experts on September 11th on.
[00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:28.930]  Maybe I should have, you know, 10, 15 guests next week.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.141]  Give them each an hour to go over all the smoking guns and red flags because still some people don't get it.
[00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:42.502]  It was an amazing success last night in Houston.
[00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:47.483]  I'm told they turned away several hundred people.
[00:03:47.803 --> 00:03:49.944]  The 300-plus seat theater was jam-packed.
[00:03:50.484 --> 00:03:51.884]  They had folding chairs out.
[00:03:53.644 --> 00:03:54.865]  They turned away hundreds of people.
[00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:56.805]  I couldn't stand to watch it happen.
[00:03:58.394 --> 00:03:59.775]  I think we're good to go.
[00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:23.670]  And this thing had almost no promotion.
[00:04:24.171 --> 00:04:28.254]  I want to thank those that did promote it there, that handed out flyers and stuff.
[00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:30.275]  So that was exciting.
[00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.017]  A bunch of news from around the world.
[00:04:32.077 --> 00:04:34.959]  A bunch of September 11th news here on September 12th.
[00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:38.201]  And I want to really take a lot of calls.
[00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:39.963]  I'm going to go to calls early in this hour.
[00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:43.966]  Your response to the propaganda that the media has been pushing.
[00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:48.749]  Your response to what do you think the biggest smoking guns or red flags of September 11th are.
[00:04:50.638 --> 00:04:52.039]  Any other news item you want to discuss?
[00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:52.679]  It's open phone.
[00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.260]  It's kind of like C-SPAN Journal.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.700]  Any news article you want to talk about?
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.741]  We're going to go to your calls quickly here.
[00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:58.282]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:58.302 --> 00:04:58.342]  800-259-9231.
[00:04:58.362 --> 00:04:58.902]  And we'll be right back.
[00:04:58.922 --> 00:04:59.302]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.402 --> 00:05:01.223]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[00:05:01.243 --> 00:05:02.744]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[00:05:15.026 --> 00:05:23.468]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[00:05:24.028 --> 00:05:26.549]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:32.331]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:37.832]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[00:05:38.392 --> 00:05:44.334]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar
[00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:57.213]  888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:05:57.834 --> 00:06:03.038]  That's www.libertydollar.org or call toll-free 888-421-6181.
[00:06:10.296 --> 00:06:14.663]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:14.843 --> 00:06:19.290]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.797]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:06:23.897 --> 00:06:25.199]  A New World Order.
[00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:31.206]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:31.246 --> 00:06:38.194]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:40.337]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:40.697 --> 00:06:51.107]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:51.307 --> 00:06:56.572]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:57.172 --> 00:06:59.833]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:59.913 --> 00:07:03.435]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:05.896]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:06.756 --> 00:07:09.277]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:09.617 --> 00:07:11.578]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:07:11.678 --> 00:07:22.363]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:27.284]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a white Berkey purification element.
[00:07:27.344 --> 00:07:38.668]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:07:39.028 --> 00:07:39.728]  We're good to go.
[00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:17.544]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:18.144 --> 00:08:21.206]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.388 --> 00:08:29.051]  All right, the government is beating the war drums...
[00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:34.017]  They're going on the warpath with North Korea, and I want to talk about that.
[00:08:34.037 --> 00:08:53.391]  I want to get more into September 11th and PNAC and the propaganda I've been seeing and hearing and reading about how if we just give our liberties up, everything will be okay, but bin Laden's about to strike us again, and there's been some new analysis done of that bin Laden tape that surfaced a few years ago where it's a fat guy in a dark room.
[00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:55.253]  They've done analysis of it.
[00:08:55.293 --> 00:08:58.475]  It's obviously not the real bin Laden tape,
[00:08:59.835 --> 00:09:02.816]  Bunch of different news items, but I've got to say this again.
[00:09:03.957 --> 00:09:06.958]  Last night in Houston, Texas was just wonderful.
[00:09:07.258 --> 00:09:21.385]  I went down there and showed The Road to Tyranny and then that dystopic, really depressing film, THX 1138, produced by and, of course, directed by and written by and all that good stuff by George Lucas, starring Robert Duvall.
[00:09:22.505 --> 00:09:24.606]  And the theater holds over, I don't know, like 300-plus people
[00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:30.735]  And they had folding chairs all in there, probably 50 folding chairs.
[00:09:31.616 --> 00:09:34.817]  And then they turned away, I was told, several hundred people.
[00:09:36.398 --> 00:09:56.268]  And the owner of the Alamo Draft House, who's a fan of the show, told me, big movie theater there in the Western Oak Shopping Center, he told me, he said, we had Lou Ferrigno here and did all this advertising, you know, the Incredible Hulk, because he's touring the country and I've seen him on a lot of TV shows because the Hulk movie came back out and they're
[00:09:58.267 --> 00:10:07.731]  They were showing that there, so Lou Ferrigno's been touring the country, and Lou Ferrigno got about half the crowd that Road to Tyranny did in Houston, and this was with almost no promotion.
[00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:10.372]  So that was definitely exciting.
[00:10:12.053 --> 00:10:13.334]  And my whole point is this.
[00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:25.179]  I'm on the radio in Houston, and that's a totally controlled neocon socialist hotbed of people that think they're conservative but are really slaves to the New World Order.
[00:10:27.524 --> 00:10:34.787]  And here we have the majority of the crowd just from Houston, and they turned away hundreds, which I'm sorry of those that got turned away.
[00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:46.071]  And so many people said, I can't believe there's this many people.
[00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:47.911]  I just came to see if there'd be anybody here.
[00:10:48.112 --> 00:10:49.472]  I can't believe it.
[00:10:49.492 --> 00:10:54.834]  Wow, I didn't know there were so many people in Houston that were aware of the New World Order.
[00:10:56.926 --> 00:10:59.087]  And that's the compartmentalization at work.
[00:10:59.207 --> 00:11:01.188]  We don't see how many people are awake.
[00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:03.809]  We don't see how many people know what's going on.
[00:11:05.049 --> 00:11:22.135]  Believe me, when you're on TV and on the radio in a city like Austin of a million people in the metro area, and you go to the grocery store, and about half the people you walk by stop you and say they agree with you.
[00:11:22.995 --> 00:11:24.356]  Black, white, old, young...
[00:11:25.211 --> 00:11:35.940]  People with foreign accents, northern accents, western accents, southern accents, when they, half of them are stopping you going, man, you're right, boy, you really, I researched what you said.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.704]  I know we can take this country back, folks, because I'm not the most articulate person.
[00:11:41.825 --> 00:11:43.806]  I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[00:11:43.946 --> 00:11:46.368]  I mean, I got a moderate IQ of about 130.
[00:11:49.131 --> 00:11:52.934]  I understand systems and propaganda and history.
[00:11:53.658 --> 00:11:56.959]  I've just done a little more research than most people, and I'm not as naive as some.
[00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:59.460]  I guess it's because of life experiences.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.841]  I saw how corrupt government is from different angles.
[00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:08.603]  But it's really, really good news that so many people are waking up.
[00:12:09.243 --> 00:12:12.704]  And when I announce this every other show, it's not bragging.
[00:12:13.944 --> 00:12:19.446]  When I say, hey, I've done a thousand radio interviews since September 11th, and
[00:12:24.173 --> 00:12:30.340]  Maybe one out of 30 callers will disagree with me.
[00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:34.906]  I'm on the air saying, Military Industrial Complex, carried out September 11th.
[00:12:34.986 --> 00:12:36.207]  Here's the bullet points.
[00:12:36.287 --> 00:12:37.969]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.371]  I talk for 30 minutes.
[00:12:39.411 --> 00:12:44.277]  They open the phones up on nationwide shows, regional shows, mom-and-pop operations.
[00:12:46.187 --> 00:12:51.693]  And the phone lines open up, and you talk to them for an hour and a half, and one guy calls in.
[00:12:51.993 --> 00:12:58.120]  Everybody else is coherent, has cogent points, has historical references, is aware of what's going on.
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.324]  And then the one guy calls in and goes, I'd like to kill you.
[00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:04.467]  I hope they put you in that cab.
[00:13:05.114 --> 00:13:07.476]  Yeah, I've helped build some of them detention centers.
[00:13:07.556 --> 00:13:09.217]  We're going to get people like you.
[00:13:09.617 --> 00:13:10.898]  You scumbag.
[00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:11.898]  You're a liberal.
[00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:14.160]  Well, Bush is going to sign the assaultman's ban, sir.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.320]  Yeah, I don't care.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.502]  You know, they've got to do some compromising.
[00:13:19.203 --> 00:13:20.584]  That happened last night, by the way.
[00:13:21.924 --> 00:13:26.127]  But getting back to the good news, I quit counting months ago.
[00:13:27.728 --> 00:13:29.089]  Over 1,000 radio interviews.
[00:13:30.603 --> 00:13:32.244]  Man, I've done dozens in the last few days.
[00:13:32.304 --> 00:13:34.185]  That's why I'm so punch drunk just from talking.
[00:13:34.205 --> 00:13:37.287]  I was about 12.30 last night leaving the movie theater.
[00:13:37.307 --> 00:13:39.088]  I've been talking to so many people, I was just going, uh.
[00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:40.729]  I was actually dizzy.
[00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.310]  I've been up since like 6 in the morning.
[00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.231]  I had like four hours of sleep.
[00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:45.212]  The night before, I was doing radio interviews.
[00:13:46.893 --> 00:13:51.156]  And I'm sitting there, you know, talking to people, and they're all, oh, what are we going to do?
[00:13:51.176 --> 00:13:51.796]  What are we going to do?
[00:13:51.816 --> 00:13:53.017]  Well, folks, you've got to take action.
[00:13:53.037 --> 00:13:54.158]  You've got to just educate others.
[00:13:54.198 --> 00:13:55.078]  It's a grassroots thing.
[00:13:55.098 --> 00:13:58.981]  We're not going to, one of us isn't going to save the planet or save the country, but
[00:14:00.655 --> 00:14:07.777]  That's very exciting to do a thousand interviews and have a couple hundred callers that disagree and tens of thousands of callers that agree.
[00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:10.838]  And it's like it's the same person.
[00:14:10.858 --> 00:14:22.662]  I could be on in New York or Chicago or South Texas or Louisiana, and the guy that calls in and disagrees is, you little squirrel, you little punk, I bet you're wearing a Che Guevara shirt, boy.
[00:14:23.122 --> 00:14:25.823]  I'm 100% Republican.
[00:14:26.443 --> 00:14:27.863]  We're going to get people like you.
[00:14:27.883 --> 00:14:29.584]  You better watch how you're talking, boy.
[00:14:30.908 --> 00:14:32.949]  Yeah, I'd like to get you in a jail cell.
[00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.851]  I've been on an England, and it's the same type of caller that disagrees.
[00:14:38.071 --> 00:14:39.412]  They've cloned these people.
[00:14:40.533 --> 00:14:43.414]  They're little dutiful bootlickers of the system.
[00:14:43.454 --> 00:14:44.755]  Deep down, they're afraid of the system.
[00:14:44.775 --> 00:14:48.456]  They know it's true, so they run to it, begging, throwing themselves at its feet.
[00:14:50.537 --> 00:14:52.298]  But the same thing happened last night.
[00:14:52.318 --> 00:14:52.338]  I...
[00:14:58.516 --> 00:14:59.697]  It's a jammed crowd.
[00:14:59.737 --> 00:15:00.237]  I mean, over 300.
[00:15:00.497 --> 00:15:02.358]  I'd say 340 people in the theater.
[00:15:02.378 --> 00:15:03.099]  The theater holds like 320.
[00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.740]  They have some extra in there.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.220]  I don't know, 350.
[00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:13.685]  And about halfway through, I'm walking back from the bathroom, and this big old guy with the crew cut.
[00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:14.365]  Looks like he's about 50.
[00:15:15.186 --> 00:15:19.468]  Looks like he weighs 270 pounds.
[00:15:19.488 --> 00:15:20.329]  It's all muscle.
[00:15:24.144 --> 00:15:27.345]  And he goes, I was a Marine, two tours in Vietnam.
[00:15:27.425 --> 00:15:30.886]  I killed for this country, and I can't believe what I'm seeing.
[00:15:30.926 --> 00:15:32.166]  He looked like he was mind-controlled.
[00:15:32.626 --> 00:15:35.487]  I mean, by that, he was like, eyes were pointing different directions.
[00:15:35.527 --> 00:15:37.468]  He was kind of like, woozing.
[00:15:37.488 --> 00:15:38.148]  He wasn't drunk.
[00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:39.188]  He was like, freaked out.
[00:15:39.669 --> 00:15:40.529]  I saw him walking out.
[00:15:40.549 --> 00:15:41.689]  He had his hand on his face.
[00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.070]  I walked up and go, how's the movie?
[00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:44.370]  He goes...
[00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:55.397]  He just goes, tells me his tape, and goes, because he's invested so much in this system that, I mean, we were an inch from breaking his programming, and he sat there for like an hour and a half.
[00:15:56.398 --> 00:15:58.519]  It's a two-hour, 20-something-minute movie.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:04.484]  He just sat there up against the wall, waiting for his wife, because he kept saying, I'm going to wait for her to come out.
[00:16:05.424 --> 00:16:12.129]  Sitting up against a wall on a bench, just leaning over, going, I can't believe it, just looking like he'd seen a ghost.
[00:16:13.735 --> 00:16:22.142]  And there was one other woman, one other young college-age woman, standing beside him going, well, yes, I see what Mr. Jones is saying, that what Bush is still good, we're all Republicans.
[00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:24.524]  And I was like, he's for assault weapons ban, open borders.
[00:16:24.544 --> 00:16:28.347]  And he goes, well, I know that, but I... You can see the cognitive dissonance.
[00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:30.689]  And he just, man, would look at me in these crazy eyes.
[00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:40.136]  And, I mean, boy, he just... And I think that's the type that calls into the radio shows.
[00:16:40.176 --> 00:16:42.098]  I think, though, when I was right there smiling at him,
[00:16:42.945 --> 00:16:45.667]  In a loving fashion, trying to break his conditioning, trying to talk to him.
[00:16:47.067 --> 00:16:48.068]  He didn't resort to that.
[00:16:48.148 --> 00:16:53.431]  Man, he'd see like these flashes of intense, you know, look if I want to rip your head off.
[00:16:55.312 --> 00:16:56.212]  Go out of this guy.
[00:16:56.292 --> 00:17:02.476]  I mean, this guy was really serious, folks.
[00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:03.956]  How do you reach out to him?
[00:17:03.996 --> 00:17:05.497]  I mean, how do you break your conditioning?
[00:17:07.898 --> 00:17:08.779]  I mean, how do you do it?
[00:17:11.578 --> 00:17:12.939]  I mean, it's like my cousin.
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:15.760]  My cousin.
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.742]  I mean, I grew up with him when he was, you know, 15 years old, and I was 6.
[00:17:22.162 --> 00:17:26.184]  He'd take me out, you know, I'd have my own 410, and he'd have the 12-gauge, and we'd go dove hunting.
[00:17:27.825 --> 00:17:35.548]  And, you know, he went into Special Forces and became an officer and been overseas most of his life, and he's back now out at the Austin Airport, and he...
[00:17:36.272 --> 00:17:43.017]  He admits they run the surveillance, the American people, and they're merging the police with the National Guard and plugging that in to the regular Army.
[00:17:43.037 --> 00:17:43.658]  And he said, yeah.
[00:17:44.098 --> 00:17:44.799]  We went to a meeting.
[00:17:44.819 --> 00:17:47.281]  We were told we're all getting microchips two years from now.
[00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:49.262]  That was now four or five months ago.
[00:17:51.364 --> 00:17:52.064]  That's my cousin.
[00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:52.805]  He said, yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:17:52.825 --> 00:17:55.287]  I kind of laughed at you at that family reunion a few years ago.
[00:17:55.347 --> 00:17:57.068]  Man, they said we're getting chips.
[00:17:59.050 --> 00:17:59.150]  And...
[00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:03.170]  You know, he had to wake up.
[00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:09.453]  I mean, you go, you serve, you think patriotism is being a good centurion, and it's not.
[00:18:11.514 --> 00:18:24.682]  Being a patriot, you know, they say it's harder to socially go against the psychology or against the overall political template, you know, to say the world is round.
[00:18:24.702 --> 00:18:26.763]  It was hard for Galileo to say that when no one else was saying it.
[00:18:28.377 --> 00:18:31.119]  It's harder to do that than to charge machine gun nests.
[00:18:31.139 --> 00:18:32.200]  They've actually done studies.
[00:18:36.024 --> 00:18:41.248]  But more and more people are breaking their conditioning, and that's a good thing.
[00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.091]  That's a very, very good thing.
[00:18:45.552 --> 00:18:48.074]  We'll come back and talk to Mark in West Virginia and others.
[00:18:48.254 --> 00:18:50.155]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231, and I will get into...
[00:18:56.573 --> 00:19:01.437]  The other news, we have Catherine Albrecht from Caspian coming up for new RFID tracker chip developments.
[00:19:02.097 --> 00:19:10.204]  And I just so happen to have the ABC News article from Tuesday, or excuse me, Wednesday, where they said to have a job anywhere you're going to be tracked by these chips.
[00:19:10.804 --> 00:19:14.127]  And, of course, all your TVs and goods will be tracked by law in your house by them.
[00:19:15.748 --> 00:19:21.413]  And there's a bunch of saber-rattling with North Korea, and the Patriot Act, too, is in trouble.
[00:19:23.374 --> 00:19:28.376]  So look for the feds to be sneaking around, you know, with their goodies to create a crisis.
[00:19:29.577 --> 00:19:35.959]  And we'll get your response to the propaganda in and around September 11th trying to push the police state and New World Order, which isn't working for them.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.001]  And is there any particular news article you'd like to talk about?
[00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:42.142]  Total free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:42.242 --> 00:19:43.582]  You know what's scary?
[00:19:43.602 --> 00:19:44.983]  I'm more cogent and focused...
[00:19:51.073 --> 00:19:54.036]  Well, I've had about six, seven hours of sleep in the last two days.
[00:19:54.076 --> 00:19:57.780]  I just got too much energy.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.881]  I'm bouncing on the walls right now.
[00:19:58.901 --> 00:20:01.604]  I feel like somebody hit me in the head with a sledgehammer.
[00:20:03.426 --> 00:20:04.146]  I like whining.
[00:20:04.627 --> 00:20:05.327]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:05.348 --> 00:20:05.628]  Stay with us.
[00:20:10.194 --> 00:20:13.675]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:20:13.935 --> 00:20:17.456]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[00:20:21.697 --> 00:20:27.858]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:20:28.278 --> 00:20:36.180]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.481]  We're good to go.
[00:20:51.968 --> 00:20:55.789]  You get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[00:23:08.064 --> 00:23:12.709]  Have you been tricked into believing that you can't hire or be hired without a social security number?
[00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:18.855]  You think that you can't bank, get a driver's license, or rent an apartment, or get insurance without a social security number.
[00:23:19.035 --> 00:23:21.878]  It seems everywhere you turn, somebody is asking for it.
[00:23:22.018 --> 00:23:29.405]  But did you know there is no law requiring you to obtain, have, or use a social security number to live or work in the United States?
[00:23:29.545 --> 00:23:30.186]  We're good to go.
[00:23:44.462 --> 00:23:44.682]  I think.
[00:24:22.036 --> 00:24:24.959]  All right, folks, we're going to go ahead and go to some of your phone calls.
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.622]  Let's talk to Mark in West Virginia.
[00:24:28.343 --> 00:24:29.204]  Mark, thanks for holding.
[00:24:29.244 --> 00:24:29.724]  You're on the air.
[00:24:29.764 --> 00:24:30.165]  Go ahead.
[00:24:30.185 --> 00:24:31.366]  Hello, Alex.
[00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:32.207]  Welcome.
[00:24:33.648 --> 00:24:35.250]  Thank you for that newsletter you sent out.
[00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:36.431]  I really appreciate it.
[00:24:36.551 --> 00:24:38.173]  I really like the article about DARPA.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.662]  I really seem to nail things down really good.
[00:24:41.983 --> 00:24:45.865]  Well, for those that don't know, tell them what my little expose on DARPA had to say.
[00:24:46.466 --> 00:24:57.875]  Well, what they said was that, you know, they're trying to do all these things to chronicle and follow all people's activities.
[00:24:58.235 --> 00:25:04.680]  They say everything you buy, everything you do, everything you say, total information.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:04.900]  I mean...
[00:25:05.561 --> 00:25:16.167]  Again, worse than 1984, worse than Brave New World, and they say that blimps will watch us at all times, that we'll have chips in us.
[00:25:16.248 --> 00:25:18.689]  I mean, they're saying they plan to do this.
[00:25:18.989 --> 00:25:20.310]  The federal government, folks.
[00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:31.817]  The part that troubles me is all these government employees took an oath of office, swore an oath to defend the Constitution, and they turn around and do stuff like this with our money.
[00:25:34.045 --> 00:25:36.007]  Let me tell you a story before I forget to do it, Mark.
[00:25:37.008 --> 00:25:46.816]  Last night at the showing of Road to Tyranny in Houston, there were several police officers there, sheriff deputies, police officers, who came from towns around Houston, one from Houston.
[00:25:47.276 --> 00:25:53.662]  One was in plain clothes, and he had just graduated like six months ago, he said, from the police academy.
[00:25:53.682 --> 00:25:59.227]  And he said, Alex, when I saw Road to Tyranny on local access TV, because they air it down there.
[00:25:59.507 --> 00:25:59.627]  Huh?
[00:26:00.945 --> 00:26:01.425]  We're good to go.
[00:26:31.643 --> 00:26:37.528]  And then I talked to another fella, and this guy took the Homeland Security test.
[00:26:38.989 --> 00:26:43.392]  And he said they gave him that psychological test, and it kept, you know, where they try to catch you in lies.
[00:26:44.012 --> 00:26:52.519]  He said it asked more than a dozen times, these hundreds of questions, will you follow orders even if you think that they're unconstitutional or you don't agree with them?
[00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:55.221]  It said, will you confiscate firearms?
[00:26:55.821 --> 00:26:58.003]  And now we know that's in the military surveys.
[00:26:58.063 --> 00:26:58.884]  That's been in the news.
[00:26:59.004 --> 00:27:00.545]  I haven't shot video of them doing it, but
[00:27:01.275 --> 00:27:08.279]  All over, folks, they're teaching them that Christians and gun owners are terrorists.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.040]  Folks, this is horrible.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.624]  They're not teaching them to arrest Habib Ahmed with a turban, which he's got rights to.
[00:27:16.504 --> 00:27:18.986]  But they tell conservative white America that
[00:27:19.466 --> 00:27:21.786]  You know, oh, this is just for those brown people.
[00:27:22.087 --> 00:27:24.727]  They're playing race, folks, manipulating you.
[00:27:25.047 --> 00:27:25.727]  It's for you.
[00:27:25.887 --> 00:27:34.529]  I want white America and black America and everybody America to know it's for people that love freedom, that have property, that aren't dependent on government.
[00:27:35.129 --> 00:27:35.749]  Understand that.
[00:27:35.769 --> 00:27:36.129]  Go ahead.
[00:27:36.249 --> 00:27:36.809]  Absolutely.
[00:27:37.329 --> 00:27:42.530]  The reason I'm calling, I saw something on the news on TV yesterday I'd like to share with you and your audience.
[00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.631]  I was watching MSNBC with Lester Holt.
[00:27:46.184 --> 00:27:49.626]  And another felon, like a contributing editor named Nachman.
[00:27:50.286 --> 00:28:04.653]  And Nachman said they were discussing the events of 9-11, and Nachman said no one could have imagined that a hijacked plane would be used as a crash into a building.
[00:28:05.014 --> 00:28:12.317]  Now, these people collect and collate and disseminate news to millions of people, and they're still in the dark two years after 9-11.
[00:28:12.337 --> 00:28:13.098]  Well, they're not in the dark.
[00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:15.559]  I mean, take Road to Journey Masters to Terror.
[00:28:16.608 --> 00:28:24.411]  We'll, like, flash on the screen 20 articles, CBS, ABC, CNN, from 95, 96, 98, 99, 2000, 2001, generally Italy, where they said that there was this plan, Project Bojinka.
[00:28:31.563 --> 00:28:32.023]  All of it.
[00:28:32.283 --> 00:28:35.645]  And, yeah, we've got clips of Condoleezza Rice going, no one had ever heard of this.
[00:28:35.945 --> 00:28:37.245]  No one had ever imagined this.
[00:28:37.566 --> 00:28:41.847]  When the government had run a drill at the Pentagon in November of 2000 doing it.
[00:28:42.688 --> 00:28:44.528]  We have that from the Army's website.
[00:28:44.588 --> 00:28:47.970]  When they did a drill that morning of flying jets into buildings.
[00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.191]  Why, they were doing a drill that morning.
[00:28:50.431 --> 00:28:51.611]  They'd never heard of it.
[00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:53.552]  That was the Associated Press.
[00:28:53.852 --> 00:28:54.512]  Let me just say something.
[00:28:55.693 --> 00:28:58.394]  One of the few newscasters I can watch is Lester Holt.
[00:28:58.414 --> 00:28:59.094]  The guy's good.
[00:28:59.534 --> 00:29:00.975]  But he's evil like the rest of them.
[00:29:01.833 --> 00:29:03.554]  And, you know, they all make me sick.
[00:29:04.674 --> 00:29:07.935]  I mean, it's an outrage that they're living in the dark.
[00:29:08.895 --> 00:29:13.656]  People that don't learn history are doomed to repeat it, to quote somebody.
[00:29:13.676 --> 00:29:16.597]  Yeah, I think that was Lord Acton.
[00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:19.558]  Or did he say power corruption, absolute power corruption?
[00:29:19.618 --> 00:29:20.158]  Absolutely.
[00:29:20.418 --> 00:29:21.738]  Well, he's right on both counts.
[00:29:22.519 --> 00:29:23.659]  I can't remember who said what.
[00:29:24.275 --> 00:29:25.516]  Anyway, thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:29:25.776 --> 00:29:32.220]  Hey, I really appreciate your call, and I hope that you'll hand, after you're done reading it, the newsletter on to somebody.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.040]  Absolutely.
[00:29:33.521 --> 00:29:34.341]  Yeah, thank you.
[00:29:34.361 --> 00:29:39.624]  That was our first, what do you call it, inaugural newsletter.
[00:29:41.125 --> 00:29:41.946]  Yeah, keep them coming.
[00:29:42.206 --> 00:29:43.407]  I look forward to every one of them.
[00:29:43.867 --> 00:29:45.208]  Well, okay, we're sending them out free.
[00:29:45.268 --> 00:29:45.708]  Thank you.
[00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:47.349]  Appreciate it.
[00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:50.271]  Yeah, it cost a lot of money to send 5,000 of those out.
[00:29:50.311 --> 00:29:51.872]  I'm sorry everybody can't get one, but...
[00:29:53.667 --> 00:29:55.950]  Buy something off of them and we can send them to everybody.
[00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:56.932]  I'll be right back.
[00:30:00.517 --> 00:30:01.418]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.918 --> 00:30:03.501]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.422 --> 00:30:07.146]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.402 --> 00:30:17.926]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[00:30:18.206 --> 00:30:22.288]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because... ...can't be beat.
[00:30:22.548 --> 00:30:23.849]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:24.069 --> 00:30:29.632]  Log on to www.wellpharmacy.com and start saving money today.
[00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:44.612]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[00:30:44.632 --> 00:30:47.976]  It's Alejandro Jones here.
[00:30:48.036 --> 00:30:48.837]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:30:50.299 --> 00:30:55.005]  We're about to go back to Brian and Mike and Ron and Don and many, many others that are holding.
[00:30:55.025 --> 00:30:57.849]  If you want to talk about September 11th, the propaganda you've been seeing,
[00:30:58.846 --> 00:30:59.727]  Like the last caller did.
[00:30:59.747 --> 00:31:00.467]  That was a good point.
[00:31:00.967 --> 00:31:04.169]  Bottom saying there was never a story about planes flying into buildings.
[00:31:04.209 --> 00:31:07.571]  No one had ever thought it of using them as remote control.
[00:31:07.931 --> 00:31:10.292]  Only the Northwoods planned in 1962.
[00:31:10.753 --> 00:31:10.973]  U.S.
[00:31:10.993 --> 00:31:14.635]  government planned to hijack jets by remote control and fly them into buildings.
[00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:19.537]  About 100 news articles.
[00:31:19.557 --> 00:31:26.279]  I mean, literally, in Masters of Terror, I show like 15, 20 news articles going through each year.
[00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:26.679]  Well, here's 95.
[00:31:26.999 --> 00:31:27.600]  Well, here's 96.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.680]  Well, here's 97.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:29.540]  Well, here's 98.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.421]  Well, here's 99.
[00:31:30.821 --> 00:31:31.861]  Well, here's 2,000.
[00:31:32.441 --> 00:31:33.622]  Oh, there's never been a plan.
[00:31:33.662 --> 00:31:35.142]  We never thought of such a thing.
[00:31:35.162 --> 00:31:45.426]  Before I go back to the calls, I really hope the listeners of this show will get our information and give it out to people, especially the books that...
[00:31:46.622 --> 00:31:47.062]  I carry.
[00:31:47.082 --> 00:31:53.886]  The book I've written, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny, covers the history of government-sponsored terror, September 11th in the police state.
[00:31:54.247 --> 00:31:57.168]  Very similar to the film Road to Tyranny, but has some added information.
[00:31:58.649 --> 00:32:07.595]  Order Out of Chaos, elite-sponsored terror in the New World Order by Paul Joseph Watson, which just came out.
[00:32:07.655 --> 00:32:09.236]  It's been published a few months.
[00:32:10.176 --> 00:32:11.757]  Very cutting edge up to date.
[00:32:12.358 --> 00:32:12.798]  Covering
[00:32:13.726 --> 00:32:25.411]  British-sponsored terror, Israeli-sponsored terror, CIA-sponsored terror, how these elite governments carry this out as a pretext to attack their enemies and to enslave their own populations.
[00:32:26.931 --> 00:32:28.312]  They get through a bunch of other facets.
[00:32:28.612 --> 00:32:31.473]  It's 300 and something pages full of photos and diagrams.
[00:32:31.893 --> 00:32:32.534]  So well done.
[00:32:32.554 --> 00:32:34.214]  I'm really proud to be the publisher of this book.
[00:32:34.615 --> 00:32:42.438]  In fact, if you want to be a distributor of Order Out of Chaos...
[00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:46.713]  We've got bulk rates for folks that want to do it.
[00:32:47.614 --> 00:32:49.035]  And the book, of course, if you buy one is $19.95.
[00:32:49.696 --> 00:32:54.600]  If you buy a second one, it is $12 or $11.95.
[00:32:55.501 --> 00:32:56.762]  You can give it as a gift.
[00:32:57.783 --> 00:33:04.889]  And this Christmas or on somebody's holiday or birthday, maybe an anniversary, give them a Road to Tyranny video.
[00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:06.250]  Give them an Order Out of Chaos book.
[00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:08.952]  Give them a Police State 3 total enslavement.
[00:33:09.073 --> 00:33:10.554]  I mean, that's...
[00:33:11.431 --> 00:33:17.473]  A gift that changes minds, that unlocks people's psyche from this bondage.
[00:33:17.533 --> 00:33:25.116]  And we found no tool out there in the information war, frankly, like my videos and in the book I've written and the book that Watson's written.
[00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:26.797]  We're getting great reviews on Watson's book.
[00:33:28.937 --> 00:33:35.420]  But if you want to be a distributor for Order Out of Chaos, we'll sell them to you at bulk for $10.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.181]  And so you'll make more money than we do on it.
[00:33:39.221 --> 00:33:42.262]  I mean, frankly, we need money to operate, but money is a secondary concern.
[00:33:42.282 --> 00:33:43.902]  It's about the information war.
[00:33:44.742 --> 00:33:54.185]  The more money we make, the more we can fight, the more people I can hire, the more videos I can make, the more I can maybe hire somebody to carry the trash out so I don't have to always do it and, you know, put light bulbs in.
[00:33:54.445 --> 00:33:57.426]  But, no, seriously, these are powerful tools.
[00:33:57.446 --> 00:34:00.847]  That's why I say make copies of my videos for nonprofit, not for sale purposes.
[00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:03.311]  I mean, who else does that?
[00:34:03.331 --> 00:34:08.854]  Do you see Viacom when they have a DVD on the shelf of some Hollywood movie saying, make copies of our DVD?
[00:34:08.894 --> 00:34:09.454]  No, you don't.
[00:34:10.875 --> 00:34:14.097]  But you do see Alex Jones doing that because I'm about freedom.
[00:34:14.137 --> 00:34:16.238]  I'm about saving this country and exposing the murderers.
[00:34:17.058 --> 00:34:28.185]  And it's up to you to get the videos, to make the copies, to get them out to people, to air them on AXS TV, to show them at your VFW hall, to put them in the local video rental store, to get them out to everybody.
[00:34:28.265 --> 00:34:30.466]  And it is having an effect.
[00:34:32.424 --> 00:34:36.707]  I've made nine films, and they're $25.95 apiece, all over two hours.
[00:34:36.807 --> 00:34:37.528]  Order three or more.
[00:34:37.808 --> 00:34:39.189]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:43.072]  So again, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:43.652 --> 00:34:44.152]  iBooks, only $12.
[00:34:45.573 --> 00:34:47.415]  And get the books, get the films today.
[00:34:47.555 --> 00:34:49.276]  InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:34:49.316 --> 00:34:49.656]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:02.337 --> 00:35:17.869]  3139.
[00:35:05.759 --> 00:35:17.869]  Or you can, again, go to infowars.com or net, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:35:18.429 --> 00:35:23.453]  If you won't take action, I don't know who will.
[00:35:24.994 --> 00:35:30.679]  If you won't resist and defend this country and your family, if you won't stand up against these thugs...
[00:35:31.641 --> 00:35:34.904]  And do the right thing and be part of history, then I don't know what I can say for you folks.
[00:35:35.104 --> 00:35:36.845]  We've got the tools to do it, so please take action.
[00:35:37.546 --> 00:35:38.867]  Brian in New York, welcome.
[00:35:39.347 --> 00:35:40.348]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[00:35:40.368 --> 00:35:41.729]  Thank you for taking my call, sir.
[00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.953]  Sir, it's ironic that those who don't believe in God are trying to act like God.
[00:35:45.973 --> 00:35:49.155]  It goes back to Genesis 3, verse 4 and 5.
[00:35:49.776 --> 00:35:52.538]  Lucifer told Eve, Ye shall not die, ye shall be as a God.
[00:35:52.578 --> 00:35:53.759]  That's why they have to have blimps.
[00:35:54.548 --> 00:35:59.371]  It's man's futile attempt to try to imitate the God of heaven, like Lucifer tried to do.
[00:35:59.391 --> 00:36:18.242]  Yeah, you're talking about, for those who don't know, you say blimps, the hundreds of FEMA and Army blimps that are going to watch all our cities, and they admit to have a job, you'll have a chip implanted on your body or hanging around your neck, and that's ABC News, and they call it total information awareness.
[00:36:18.562 --> 00:36:19.803]  Only God is omnipotent.
[00:36:21.397 --> 00:36:21.917]  For sure, sir.
[00:36:22.398 --> 00:36:26.080]  It's man's people attempt, because if they buy the lie of Lucifer, they're going to be his god.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:31.424]  You go to the second psalm, when they say the kings of the earth will rally against the god of heaven, he just laughed at them.
[00:36:32.104 --> 00:36:37.828]  I mean, people have to understand that the only reason why Lucifer is allowed to exist is to give man free will, which way he's going to go.
[00:36:38.368 --> 00:36:41.230]  Anybody who will follow Lucifer really has to be crazy.
[00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.031]  I mean, they're going to be quite wrong with you.
[00:36:43.491 --> 00:36:45.052]  What does Lucifer have to offer you?
[00:36:45.152 --> 00:36:47.574]  Nothing in this life, and hell in the next life.
[00:36:48.052 --> 00:36:49.373]  That's why anybody would follow him.
[00:36:49.613 --> 00:36:51.254]  I can't explain that in my mind, sir.
[00:36:53.175 --> 00:36:53.955]  No, I hear you.
[00:36:55.015 --> 00:37:02.939]  Listen, Brian, on the eve of September 11th, I watched about an hour and a half, two hours of TV, more than I'd watched in three or four weeks before that.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.040]  Saw Bush crying.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.182]  Saw Bush saying, pass Patriot Act II or Bin Laden's going to get you.
[00:37:08.202 --> 00:37:09.422]  Bin Laden's going to reemerge.
[00:37:09.442 --> 00:37:11.323]  An hour later, Bin Laden's on TV.
[00:37:11.443 --> 00:37:12.104]  I'm going to get you.
[00:37:12.124 --> 00:37:13.264]  Always backing up his boss.
[00:37:14.325 --> 00:37:15.906]  Just like Bin Laden appears for...
[00:37:17.785 --> 00:37:24.849]  Or the Secretary of State, when he's giving a speech, and he says, oh, Ben Lawton's on TV right now, or the new tape service, and they go, no, it hasn't.
[00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:25.350]  Oh, it will.
[00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:29.372]  I mean, your comments on that, because I didn't watch TV yesterday.
[00:37:29.412 --> 00:37:30.993]  I listened to some of the radio yesterday.
[00:37:31.754 --> 00:37:34.875]  And frankly, that means my analysis is not as good as it used to be.
[00:37:34.935 --> 00:37:36.156]  People keep saying, what's going to happen?
[00:37:36.176 --> 00:37:36.676]  What's next?
[00:37:37.297 --> 00:37:39.518]  And I still have a lot of discernment, and I can read the news.
[00:37:39.678 --> 00:37:42.920]  I can't stand watching them, though, and I learn more from watching them.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.722]  I should make myself watch them, but it's too painful to...
[00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:50.793]  And I'm too happy not watching them, but have you been watching them?
[00:37:50.833 --> 00:37:51.533]  What are they up to?
[00:37:51.653 --> 00:37:54.535]  Well, if I could put a chronological order, make it very brief.
[00:37:55.375 --> 00:37:58.817]  On the 20th of August, we tear down the Ten Commandments.
[00:37:58.917 --> 00:38:00.918]  At the same time, Mars is closer to the Earth.
[00:38:01.458 --> 00:38:05.460]  That's like with incidental, sir, because Mars represents Aries, Lucifer.
[00:38:06.418 --> 00:38:15.462]  Okay, for those that don't know, we said something big will happen, not because we believe that Mars does something, but you've all heard about the presidents and their astrologers and the weird shaman.
[00:38:15.762 --> 00:38:23.585]  The elite is obsessed with astrology and the occult, and what did they do?
[00:38:23.785 --> 00:38:24.345]  Big deal.
[00:38:24.645 --> 00:38:31.448]  The Republican president with his Republican judges ordered that Ten Commandments out of there and declared war on God.
[00:38:31.488 --> 00:38:31.808]  Go ahead.
[00:38:32.572 --> 00:38:35.513]  At that day on Wall Street, the Dow went down $6.66.
[00:38:35.653 --> 00:38:38.895]  That's not quite incidental.
[00:38:39.375 --> 00:38:42.196]  These people are obsessed with numerology and symbology.
[00:38:42.857 --> 00:38:46.498]  Let me stop you again for somebody that doubts that, and I haven't had time to track this.
[00:38:47.019 --> 00:38:50.980]  I've had three or four hours of sleep again, and I got up this morning and shuffled around.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.282]  I'm sure there will be more numerological tags.
[00:38:55.162 --> 00:38:56.643]  One year ago and one day...
[00:38:57.623 --> 00:39:01.965]  What did the New York Lottery on the one-year anniversary of September 11th, Brian, what did it come up as?
[00:39:01.985 --> 00:39:02.906]  9-1-1.
[00:39:03.987 --> 00:39:06.428]  That wasn't the Texas Lottery.
[00:39:06.448 --> 00:39:07.749]  That wasn't the Illinois Lottery.
[00:39:07.789 --> 00:39:10.370]  That wasn't the Ohio Lottery, the Florida Lottery, the Powerball.
[00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:12.891]  That was the New York Lottery.
[00:39:13.192 --> 00:39:23.217]  What did the Chicago Mercantile, where they really make their so-called money, where they do their scams, what did the Chicago Mercantile come up, according to the Associated Press, on the one-year anniversary?
[00:39:23.497 --> 00:39:24.218]  That came up on 9-11, too.
[00:39:26.064 --> 00:39:30.430]  911.0000, which is like 1 out of 14 trillion the article said.
[00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:32.192]  It's impossible!
[00:39:32.953 --> 00:39:38.381]  So, they're not just... See, again, it's always in your face.
[00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:40.023]  And folks, you take the money.
[00:39:40.304 --> 00:39:40.824]  And it's true.
[00:39:40.865 --> 00:39:41.666]  I've now seen this.
[00:39:42.833 --> 00:39:50.057]  For a year and, you know, almost two years, people have noticed that if you fold the 20s, it shows the towers perfectly smoking right at their points.
[00:39:50.517 --> 00:39:52.958]  You turn it around, it shows the Pentagon perfectly smoking.
[00:39:53.578 --> 00:40:02.363]  Now they've found that if you fold the 5, the 10, the 20, the 50, the 100, it goes through the sequence of the towers all the way through collapsing.
[00:40:03.483 --> 00:40:08.786]  Now, see, people can't deal with that type of forethought and scripting.
[00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:12.148]  It's like Bush, back on September 11th, Bush Sr.,
[00:40:13.203 --> 00:40:17.745]  Eleven years before giving the New World Order speech on September 11th.
[00:40:17.765 --> 00:40:19.406]  These guys... Brian, go ahead.
[00:40:19.426 --> 00:40:21.026]  I'll give you an example.
[00:40:21.227 --> 00:40:23.828]  October 9th of next month comes out the new money.
[00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:25.248]  The Federal Reserve already has it.
[00:40:25.788 --> 00:40:30.250]  It's always nine, and the occult nine is the number of finality, meaning now they're getting ready.
[00:40:30.611 --> 00:40:31.991]  Look at the month of September.
[00:40:32.531 --> 00:40:33.152]  Nine letters.
[00:40:33.792 --> 00:40:35.012]  Look at the word Northeast.
[00:40:35.453 --> 00:40:36.013]  Nine letters.
[00:40:36.053 --> 00:40:37.193]  Look at the word Communism.
[00:40:37.233 --> 00:40:37.694]  Nine letters.
[00:40:38.094 --> 00:40:39.114]  It's not coincidental.
[00:40:39.154 --> 00:40:40.795]  This is how the mind of Lucifer works.
[00:40:41.443 --> 00:40:44.305]  And people have to understand that this is a spiritual fight.
[00:40:44.825 --> 00:40:46.066]  It goes into spirituality.
[00:40:46.286 --> 00:40:53.090]  And the globalist system is into its seal, and for them, their signs are everywhere.
[00:40:53.530 --> 00:41:08.199]  When they're on the news and Ridge says, this power blackout was a test for us, this was our test, when they come out and say, when Bush gives his speech at the Pentagon and goes, it's a dark cult of evil, no one knows its power,
[00:41:08.979 --> 00:41:19.821]  And he started talking about how powerful evil is and unstoppable, and how the hijackers were tools of a dark cult of evil, and the guys that admitted member of the Grove and Skull and Bones.
[00:41:19.861 --> 00:41:21.702]  I mean, it's hidden in plain view.
[00:41:22.642 --> 00:41:26.703]  Well, you see, sir, when you watch them, they tell you what they're doing.
[00:41:26.743 --> 00:41:27.443]  They're mocking you.
[00:41:27.523 --> 00:41:29.444]  And they say, well, you're too stupid to figure it out.
[00:41:30.224 --> 00:41:32.364]  I mean, you have to understand, why did Lucifer fall?
[00:41:32.384 --> 00:41:33.364]  Because of his pride.
[00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:35.585]  These people must boast.
[00:41:36.417 --> 00:41:37.458]  We're good to go.
[00:41:37.518 --> 00:41:37.818]  I think?
[00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:02.057]  I mean, what you're doing, you're slapping in the face of God.
[00:42:02.117 --> 00:42:08.779]  Yeah, and notice, they're not just saying, leave these people alone, let them have their own lifestyle, whatever, in my bedroom, whatever they say.
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:15.742]  Now it's all the TV shows, the schools, pushing it, selling it, selling a culture of death.
[00:42:15.762 --> 00:42:20.664]  And then it comes out in Rolling Stone that a large percentage of these folks want to die of AIDS.
[00:42:20.724 --> 00:42:21.784]  Again, a culture of death.
[00:42:23.004 --> 00:42:24.365]  Let's go even further now.
[00:42:24.966 --> 00:42:26.426]  We see the bars are open.
[00:42:26.566 --> 00:42:29.107]  The blue-collar jobs in the factories are going to China.
[00:42:29.127 --> 00:42:31.187]  And they say it's going to get seven times worse.
[00:42:31.927 --> 00:42:34.108]  The federal government says it's going to get seven times worse.
[00:42:34.828 --> 00:42:37.309]  Also, you've got the white-collar jobs not going to India.
[00:42:37.789 --> 00:42:40.129]  Any jobs that are left, they bring the illegal aliens here.
[00:42:40.189 --> 00:42:40.469]  Why?
[00:42:40.509 --> 00:42:45.090]  Because they have to break the middle class because the poor are always the pawns of the rich.
[00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:49.031]  I've got a friend running for county commissioner and he goes out to these people's houses who are being harassed.
[00:42:49.891 --> 00:42:53.512]  The illegal aliens... And again, folks, that's...
[00:42:54.691 --> 00:42:57.592]  Half the population of California, half the population of Florida.
[00:42:57.952 --> 00:42:59.712]  That's just what's on the census, folks.
[00:42:59.772 --> 00:43:00.753]  Most of them won't go on the census.
[00:43:01.273 --> 00:43:03.333]  But the cops just walk into their houses.
[00:43:03.613 --> 00:43:04.474]  There's no warrants.
[00:43:04.494 --> 00:43:05.314]  There's no nothing.
[00:43:05.994 --> 00:43:09.535]  And we'll talk to them in Spanish, and they say, well, this is how it is in Mexico.
[00:43:09.935 --> 00:43:11.375]  I didn't know I could say no to this.
[00:43:12.055 --> 00:43:13.796]  But see, that's perfect training, too.
[00:43:14.608 --> 00:43:15.509]  For the establishment.
[00:43:15.849 --> 00:43:19.492]  Well, these people are perfectly willing to live in a parliamentary system of government.
[00:43:19.512 --> 00:43:20.532]  They don't know what freedom is.
[00:43:20.552 --> 00:43:24.495]  They've been living in poverty and ignorance all their lives.
[00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:26.156]  That's the kind of people they want in this country.
[00:43:26.476 --> 00:43:27.617]  Willing, obedient slaves.
[00:43:27.637 --> 00:43:29.599]  When the ministers jump, they'll say, all right.
[00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:37.164]  And instead of trying to fix their country, the globalists are ruining it further and driving them all here.
[00:43:38.365 --> 00:43:41.007]  They want us to be drones that react instead of people that think.
[00:43:41.167 --> 00:43:42.148]  I'll give you another example.
[00:43:42.188 --> 00:43:44.009]  Tomorrow they're going to blockade North Korea.
[00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.371]  Bush is doing the same thing FDR did with Japan.
[00:43:47.932 --> 00:43:50.573]  They put the warships on the Japanese coast.
[00:43:50.613 --> 00:43:51.673]  They've been at oil embargoes.
[00:43:51.733 --> 00:43:53.514]  They couldn't get any food.
[00:43:53.954 --> 00:43:54.915]  They want a pro-war.
[00:43:54.995 --> 00:44:01.338]  Now, this is something I was going to get to, and we need to spend some more time on this, and they're not making a big enough deal of this.
[00:44:01.638 --> 00:44:02.979]  Tell them about the blockade, Brian.
[00:44:03.559 --> 00:44:07.721]  Well, in World War II, Roosevelt, he blockaded the Japanese, as Bush is doing.
[00:44:08.522 --> 00:44:10.463]  Roosevelt froze their bank accounts.
[00:44:10.503 --> 00:44:11.864]  They couldn't get any oil, couldn't get any food.
[00:44:11.884 --> 00:44:13.125]  They're doing the same thing in North Korea.
[00:44:13.625 --> 00:44:16.306]  They want North Korea to launch a nuclear weapon.
[00:44:16.326 --> 00:44:19.348]  They're going to let it go to either San Francisco or Los Angeles.
[00:44:19.988 --> 00:44:22.370]  And there's your third world war being a two-front war.
[00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:27.973]  We're going to fight North Korea, and then Syria, and we're going to fight Saudi Arabia at the same time.
[00:44:28.073 --> 00:44:29.513]  Israel's going to take on Iraq.
[00:44:30.094 --> 00:44:32.115]  India and Pakistan go at each other.
[00:44:32.155 --> 00:44:33.255]  China grabs Taiwan.
[00:44:33.596 --> 00:44:34.656]  We try to save Taiwan.
[00:44:34.716 --> 00:44:36.117]  Russia, it's like a bar fight.
[00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:38.208]  That's what they want.
[00:44:38.488 --> 00:44:42.769]  So this way, the Antichrist will come in, like when the police come in and they stop a bomb fight.
[00:44:43.149 --> 00:44:44.570]  He's going to say, well, who started all this?
[00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:45.510]  Oh, I know what it was.
[00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:48.430]  It was religion, nationalism, and national currency.
[00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:50.751]  We're going to have man as God, borderless world.
[00:44:50.851 --> 00:44:52.591]  And that's what Coffee Aaron said right after 9-1-1.
[00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:54.532]  He said we've got to have a world religion.
[00:44:55.792 --> 00:44:57.352]  And it's going to be a cashless society.
[00:44:57.392 --> 00:44:58.953]  First the card, then the chip.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.200]  Absolutely.
[00:45:01.361 --> 00:45:06.024]  You know, Houston's a big military town, and I talk to a lot of families and mothers and fathers of troops.
[00:45:06.124 --> 00:45:08.546]  I talk to troops that have just gotten back.
[00:45:28.928 --> 00:45:34.170]  Who had been there since before the war started in the preparations for the war, so they've finally gotten back a few of them.
[00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.392]  And they said that when you walk on base, everyone's looking straight down.
[00:45:37.972 --> 00:45:39.073]  Everybody knows the government.
[00:45:39.273 --> 00:45:41.834]  They said everybody knows the government carried out September 11th.
[00:45:42.654 --> 00:45:46.436]  It's all the Arabs say to them, the stuff, the information's everywhere.
[00:45:46.456 --> 00:45:55.380]  And, of course, the Washington Times reported, before the war, the morale was the lowest it's ever been in the Pentagon because hundreds were in on it,
[00:45:56.087 --> 00:46:03.109]  With the control of the planes, they know they were ordered to stand down by the president, and now that's leaked out everywhere, even come out in the news.
[00:46:04.009 --> 00:46:06.170]  And so the globalists have got big problems, man.
[00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:08.651]  I don't see what they can do now but escalate this even.
[00:46:08.971 --> 00:46:10.831]  You know, Brian, I think this blew up in their face.
[00:46:10.891 --> 00:46:11.391]  I really do.
[00:46:11.431 --> 00:46:12.332]  I'm not just saying that.
[00:46:12.772 --> 00:46:14.192]  I'll prove to you it is blowing in their face.
[00:46:14.212 --> 00:46:15.032]  I'll tell you very quick.
[00:46:15.812 --> 00:46:18.793]  Number one, there's five court cases.
[00:46:19.133 --> 00:46:22.094]  There's three in Manhattan federal court that's coming to respond next week.
[00:46:22.674 --> 00:46:24.715]  Next week, the Saudi Arabians are suing
[00:46:25.751 --> 00:46:26.391]  We're good to go.
[00:46:45.708 --> 00:46:46.168]  9-11.
[00:46:46.288 --> 00:46:52.533]  The Houston Casualty Insurance Company, Houston Taxi, the Bush family, dropped him as his carrier.
[00:46:52.873 --> 00:46:54.134]  He couldn't get any more insurance.
[00:46:54.154 --> 00:46:55.115]  He had to go to sign risk.
[00:46:55.615 --> 00:46:56.676]  And then these two things hit.
[00:46:56.736 --> 00:46:59.818]  When he went to court, he says to them, look, why couldn't I get insurance?
[00:46:59.838 --> 00:47:05.402]  Because he's suing the sign risk pool because he's saying, I want $7 billion because it was two separate incidents.
[00:47:05.442 --> 00:47:06.203]  They're saying no.
[00:47:06.863 --> 00:47:08.545]  Which one is he going to get $3.5 billion?
[00:47:09.574 --> 00:47:11.155]  Then he came out with Houston Casualty.
[00:47:11.175 --> 00:47:14.118]  They turn around and he says, what do you got to do with JPMorgan Chase?
[00:47:14.559 --> 00:47:16.520]  So these are some friends that started writing each other out.
[00:47:16.981 --> 00:47:21.885]  Plus the fact, I don't know if you heard the court decision with Albert Hellestein that came Monday, the first Monday.
[00:47:22.386 --> 00:47:26.069]  He says that only the airlines are responsible for 9-11.
[00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:34.737]  What they don't tell you is that the airlines have the stock certificate that these five banks took down to sell these three airlines short before this happened.
[00:47:34.757 --> 00:47:35.918]  Let me stop you.
[00:47:36.969 --> 00:47:44.414]  You know, the FBI and CIA agents that ordered the hijackers to be given their visas back into the country, this is mainstream news, folks.
[00:47:44.434 --> 00:47:45.975]  It was commonly reported years ago.
[00:47:47.296 --> 00:47:50.478]  They all got record cash bonuses, and this is the Financial Times of London.
[00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:54.201]  Grasso got $5 million bonus for 9-1-1 leadership.
[00:47:54.221 --> 00:48:04.288]  The New York Stock Exchange awarded the chairman, Richard Grasso, all these guys are former CIA, but let's admit it, a special bonus of $5 million to reflect his...
[00:48:05.746 --> 00:48:13.608]  Sterling leadership following the September 11th attacks, taking his total 2001 pay to $30.5 million and emerged on Wednesday.
[00:48:15.208 --> 00:48:16.948]  And Chairman Grasso.
[00:48:19.029 --> 00:48:21.109]  I mean, think about that, folks.
[00:48:22.189 --> 00:48:24.990]  And these are the guys all involved covering up the insider trading.
[00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.990]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:28.751]  By the way, Johnny Cash died, folks.
[00:48:28.771 --> 00:48:29.351]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:31.403 --> 00:48:33.204]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[00:48:33.404 --> 00:48:36.266]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?

[00:48:52.358 --> 00:48:53.999]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:48:54.019 --> 00:48:54.560]  We're good to go.

[00:49:25.006 --> 00:49:25.046]  800-430-6692.
[00:49:31.528 --> 00:49:39.053]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[00:49:39.333 --> 00:49:52.281]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:49:52.581 --> 00:49:53.021]  That's right.
[00:49:53.061 --> 00:49:57.222]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:49:57.282 --> 00:50:00.143]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapters.
[00:50:19.329 --> 00:50:22.992]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:23.012 --> 00:50:26.615]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:26.755 --> 00:50:29.858]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:29.878 --> 00:50:30.879]  The New World Order.
[00:50:48.317 --> 00:50:52.540]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:59.524]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:50:59.664 --> 00:51:01.746]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:01.926 --> 00:51:12.473]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:12.673 --> 00:51:13.814]  If you want to understand what the
[00:51:13.834 --> 00:51:14.114]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:14.134 --> 00:51:15.436]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:51:34.523 --> 00:51:35.064]  Don't worry.
[00:51:35.504 --> 00:51:37.046]  This show is documented.
[00:51:37.546 --> 00:51:40.349]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:40.729 --> 00:51:44.192]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:51:44.713 --> 00:51:48.696]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:51:49.237 --> 00:51:51.139]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:51:52.199 --> 00:51:55.241]  By the way, that was the regularly scheduled music.
[00:51:55.261 --> 00:51:58.903]  We're sorry that Johnny Cash died last night of complications of diabetes.
[00:51:58.943 --> 00:51:59.803]  I like Johnny Cash.
[00:52:01.924 --> 00:52:11.729]  I got all this great music we never put into the show, like... I hear the train a-blowing, it's coming around the bend, and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.
[00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:18.273]  Yeah, we're all going to be stuck in Folsom Prison, my friends, because this country's turning into a police state.
[00:52:19.954 --> 00:52:20.454]  And, uh...
[00:52:22.492 --> 00:52:25.033]  That Ritter character died, too.
[00:52:25.073 --> 00:52:26.493]  I don't know why I'm talking about this.
[00:52:26.533 --> 00:52:28.554]  I mean, Johnny Cash, I guess, is memorable.
[00:52:29.214 --> 00:52:32.815]  We're about to go into World War III, though, so John Ritter and Johnny Cash dying.
[00:52:32.855 --> 00:52:33.595]  I'm sorry.
[00:52:33.896 --> 00:52:41.698]  I know I should talk about that at the first show, but celebrity is not as important as our families and what's happening in our society.
[00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:42.678]  Brian, finish up.
[00:52:42.758 --> 00:52:46.659]  I'm going to go to Mike and Fred and Ron and others.
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:47.280]  Yes, yes.
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:48.280]  Very quickly.
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:51.401]  There's also two other cases that the Bush family has to encounter.
[00:52:52.057 --> 00:52:58.559]  Representative Bob Graham is going to impeach Mr. Bush for violation of Article 4, Section 4 of the Constitution of that state.
[00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:03.621]  Each state should be guaranteed a Republican form of government and be protected from invasion.
[00:53:03.981 --> 00:53:11.123]  There's another committee not going to go after him because of 9-11 and with the fact that Iraq doesn't even have water pistols, let alone a nuclear bomb.
[00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:15.514]  So these people are up against the war, sir, and they're going to do something very dangerous.
[00:53:15.634 --> 00:53:20.478]  That's why I say... Now, I got the article here from, what is this, Times of London.
[00:53:20.498 --> 00:53:32.269]  They're saying that they're going to send ships with Japan and others to start interdicting, quote, vessels of interest, but they've already had a bunch of shootouts with North Korean boats.
[00:53:32.469 --> 00:53:37.994]  North Korea is run by a demon, but again, it's a bigger demon going in to take out a smaller demon to create a bigger crisis.
[00:53:39.435 --> 00:53:40.616]  You're calling it a blockade.
[00:53:40.676 --> 00:53:42.838]  I mean, I would say that really is what we're dealing with.
[00:53:42.878 --> 00:53:52.388]  And you notice they put out three different battle plans, leaked them, the actual detailed how they're going to nuke them and take out their bunkers and preemptively strike them.
[00:53:53.543 --> 00:53:59.910]  I mean, that's like somebody saying, I'm coming over to your house to kill you, so you come out and meet them in the driveway or down the road.
[00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:11.183]  I mean, this is just asking for that psychopath Kim Jong-il, who Rumsfeld gave reactors to, China was armed by our government, and then gave them the Long March technology.
[00:54:12.004 --> 00:54:14.026]  This is classic, isn't it, Brian?
[00:54:14.522 --> 00:54:16.042]  Well, they're doing the same thing with Japan.
[00:54:16.182 --> 00:54:22.084]  You see, the American people will not fight until they're struck first, because the American people are Christian people.
[00:54:22.124 --> 00:54:23.364]  They're trying to live a decent life.
[00:54:23.904 --> 00:54:27.105]  So we're not, when we say offensive, we're defensive fighters.
[00:54:27.145 --> 00:54:29.645]  We don't become offensive until we're struck first.
[00:54:29.685 --> 00:54:33.646]  Then we go for blood, because that's our Christian upbringing, which is the right way to be.
[00:54:34.206 --> 00:54:36.827]  Remember one thing about this guy in North Korea.
[00:54:36.847 --> 00:54:37.607]  This is the first...
[00:54:38.317 --> 00:54:39.237]  That's it.
[00:54:39.257 --> 00:54:39.557]  Absolutely.
[00:54:39.597 --> 00:54:40.578]  Thanks for the call.
[00:54:40.598 --> 00:54:41.138]  Serious trouble.
[00:54:41.158 --> 00:54:41.438]  Mike in Nevada.
[00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:42.358]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:54:42.378 --> 00:54:42.418]  Hi.
[00:54:42.438 --> 00:54:42.498]  Yes.
[00:54:42.518 --> 00:54:43.498]  You know, I don't know if any...
[00:55:02.987 --> 00:55:09.431]  People will kind of pick up on this, but I remember Fritz Springmeier saying something as an aside in one of his talks.
[00:55:09.452 --> 00:55:23.922]  I don't know if you remember it, where he was talking about a high echelon businessman who traveled in these circles, and for some reason the people he came in contact with assumed that he knew a secret that they knew.
[00:55:24.942 --> 00:55:25.803]  Of course, he didn't.
[00:55:26.844 --> 00:55:28.885]  They apparently were like Satanists.
[00:55:29.881 --> 00:55:35.894]  And over the years he put together, he says, I see there's a structural architecture to their...
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:46.543]  Yeah, and so all this code word stuff, all this out in the open, for us, the profane, the uninitiated, we don't understand it when it's all right there.
[00:55:46.723 --> 00:55:52.625]  All the all-seeing-eye symbols, all the weird 6-6 this, 6-6 that, you know, just everywhere.
[00:55:52.845 --> 00:55:56.146]  Well, he said it was an octahedron.
[00:55:57.766 --> 00:56:01.988]  And the classic octahedron crystal in nature is fluoride.
[00:56:04.617 --> 00:56:05.437]  It goes on and on.
[00:56:05.518 --> 00:56:05.978]  You know what?
[00:56:06.258 --> 00:56:07.098]  You can stay there, sir.
[00:56:07.118 --> 00:56:08.159]  We'll get back to you on the other side.
[00:56:08.499 --> 00:56:09.379]  And this is real, folks.
[00:56:09.399 --> 00:56:13.061]  I want to talk about something that's real.
[00:56:13.261 --> 00:56:16.023]  And, I mean, the world is run by psychopathic occultists.
[00:56:16.143 --> 00:56:17.323]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[00:56:17.483 --> 00:56:18.264]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:21.545 --> 00:56:27.949]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:56:28.109 --> 00:56:32.371]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass...
[00:56:35.387 --> 00:56:38.608]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.212 --> 00:56:47.872]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.533 --> 00:56:49.593]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.293 --> 00:56:51.434]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.454 --> 00:56:52.914]  You want answers?
[00:56:52.934 --> 00:56:54.595]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.195 --> 00:56:59.057]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.377 --> 00:57:03.479]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.311 --> 00:57:06.312]  All right, my friends.
[00:57:06.392 --> 00:57:08.033]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:57:08.093 --> 00:57:09.234]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:10.315 --> 00:57:15.379]  Already into the second hour of the September 12, 2003 Worldwide Edition.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:21.324]  We've got Catherine Albert coming up to talk about a protest and new breaking news about RFID tracker chips.
[00:57:21.344 --> 00:57:27.268]  They're going to go into everything you do and track everything you do as part of total information awareness enslavement.
[00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:29.210]  Mike in Nevada.
[00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:30.731]  We'll go to Fred, Ron, Melissa, and others.
[00:57:32.052 --> 00:57:32.913]  Mike was bringing up...
[00:57:34.244 --> 00:57:35.065]  But now it's so blatant.
[00:57:44.335 --> 00:57:46.796]  And, of course, one of their main symbols is the all-seeing eye.
[00:57:47.336 --> 00:57:50.456]  And like Sauron and Lord of the Rings, that's the sign of evil.
[00:57:50.996 --> 00:57:58.238]  Even the studier of ancient occult activities there at the major university in England, J.R.R.
[00:57:58.298 --> 00:58:00.618]  Tolkien, stylized all that.
[00:58:00.658 --> 00:58:02.679]  It was art imitating life.
[00:58:02.739 --> 00:58:05.339]  It wasn't life imitating art with Lord of the Rings.
[00:58:05.359 --> 00:58:06.520]  It was all archetypal.
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:12.701]  Let's go back to the all-seeing eye, burning eye, radiating the earth.
[00:58:13.533 --> 00:58:16.014]  Get into that in Police State 3, Tuttle and Sloyman.
[00:58:16.954 --> 00:58:17.835]  Let's go ahead.
[00:58:18.275 --> 00:58:19.315]  Symbol of total information.
[00:58:20.536 --> 00:58:21.056]  Let's go ahead.
[00:58:21.076 --> 00:58:21.976]  Mike, finish up.
[00:58:22.397 --> 00:58:28.359]  Yeah, I just... You know, the octahedron is two four-sided pyramids joined at the base.
[00:58:28.999 --> 00:58:33.081]  You have two points, kind of a duality, top and bottom.
[00:58:33.841 --> 00:58:39.363]  In the middle is a square plane, which is the only thing it has in common with the cube.
[00:58:39.483 --> 00:58:40.144]  And the cube is...
[00:58:41.454 --> 00:58:42.114]  We're good to go.
[00:59:10.191 --> 00:59:13.554]  That middle square, and then if you start going up, it slopes inward.
[00:59:13.694 --> 00:59:16.596]  Yeah, it's an evil mathematic code, the global issues.
[00:59:16.656 --> 00:59:17.096]  It's true.
[00:59:17.116 --> 00:59:18.557]  I don't get into it a lot.
[00:59:18.678 --> 00:59:19.338]  They're into it.
[00:59:19.358 --> 00:59:20.179]  They're obsessed with it.
[00:59:20.199 --> 00:59:20.779]  Thanks for the call.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.080]  Good to hear from you.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:22.821]  Fred in Texas.
[00:59:22.861 --> 00:59:23.481]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:59:27.024 --> 00:59:28.345]  Hello, Fred.
[00:59:28.365 --> 00:59:29.666]  Hey, Alex.
[00:59:29.846 --> 00:59:36.051]  I think I can officially say I know how you felt a couple years ago when you would talk and nobody would listen.
[00:59:36.791 --> 00:59:38.893]  I tried playing Eric Kofschmidt's film,
[00:59:39.731 --> 00:59:42.133]  Well, College Station's a giant mind control facility.
[01:00:05.996 --> 01:00:06.396]  Yeah.
[01:00:06.496 --> 01:00:24.368]  They've got Lord Bush's, the socialist library there, and they also, there at the facility, have the Homeland Security setting up a base of operations there.
[01:00:25.009 --> 01:00:28.411]  Well, they've got the van, the Homeland Security van.
[01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:30.912]  It looks like a Big Brother version of the ice cream truck.
[01:00:31.653 --> 01:00:34.555]  Yeah, those Homeland Security vans driving around, see Homeland Security on the side.
[01:00:35.169 --> 01:00:38.732]  Yeah, so, I mean, you've got a lot of people that are frozen into that paradigm.
[01:00:38.772 --> 01:00:42.034]  Now, I went to Houston, and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up.
[01:00:42.054 --> 01:00:43.996]  300, I don't know, 40, 50 got in.
[01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:46.317]  They had to turn away several hundred, I'm told.
[01:00:46.818 --> 01:00:48.579]  There were two people that disagreed with the film.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:52.282]  Okay, so that's the numbers I saw.
[01:00:52.362 --> 01:00:58.306]  In College Station, you haven't had any of the people having their conditioning broken.
[01:00:59.467 --> 01:01:01.569]  How many people were there for what you showed?
[01:01:02.372 --> 01:01:16.277]  There was about, I'd say, 15 people that were there, and then more were coming in, but there was 15 to begin with, and that was really... Yeah, you may be able to break their conditioning.
[01:01:16.877 --> 01:01:17.497]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:17.517 --> 01:01:18.017]  Appreciate it.
[01:01:18.057 --> 01:01:18.417]  Take care.
[01:01:18.437 --> 01:01:19.838]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:20.918 --> 01:01:22.839]  You see, Road to Tyranny is different.
[01:01:23.859 --> 01:01:24.720]  Eric's works great.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:30.101]  I carry it at InfoWars.com, but the problem is it just covers 9-1-1.
[01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:31.802]  You've got to give them the history beforehand...
[01:01:32.802 --> 01:01:40.945]  You've got to show them examples of people need that narrative, that historical system to work out of, to then understand.
[01:01:42.746 --> 01:01:44.547]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:47.628]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?

[01:02:43.616 --> 01:02:50.998]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:51.259 --> 01:02:56.000]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:01.862]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:02.142 --> 01:03:02.842]  We're good to go.
[01:03:18.733 --> 01:03:21.255]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:03:21.475 --> 01:03:28.219]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:03:28.419 --> 01:03:33.682]  Order online now at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[01:03:42.327 --> 01:03:45.809]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:49.591]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:03:49.671 --> 01:03:53.614]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:59.997]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:04:00.417 --> 01:04:08.322]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:04:08.722 --> 01:04:14.084]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:04:14.224 --> 01:04:18.006]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:04:18.366 --> 01:04:20.227]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:04:20.287 --> 01:04:22.468]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:04:22.688 --> 01:04:27.950]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91, or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:31.792]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:04:37.975 --> 01:04:39.376]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:04:39.617 --> 01:04:40.457]  Protect your family.
[01:04:42.839 --> 01:04:45.441]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:48.923]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:51.525 --> 01:04:52.686]  All right, folks.
[01:04:53.106 --> 01:04:53.807]  We're back live.
[01:04:53.827 --> 01:04:56.889]  And for all the callers that are patiently holding, we're going to get to you very soon.
[01:04:56.909 --> 01:04:57.770]  So just stay there.
[01:04:57.790 --> 01:04:58.570]  I want to talk to you.
[01:04:59.591 --> 01:05:01.933]  The next 20 minutes or so, we're joined by Catherine Albrecht.
[01:05:03.573 --> 01:05:06.455]  And she's with no cards, the head of Caspian.
[01:05:07.856 --> 01:05:08.816]  So they're at Harvard.
[01:05:09.016 --> 01:05:14.120]  She's been researching the Cashless Society control grid for some time.
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:23.865]  Of course, yesterday we read out of one of the PNAC documents, their, quote, global control grid, and the Total Information Awareness Network and how all this integrates.
[01:05:24.066 --> 01:05:27.968]  One big subject we've been discussing is RFID, radio frequency identification.
[01:05:29.281 --> 01:05:39.967]  And a few months ago here on the show, she broke the news and since been in the Wall Street Journal, a bunch of other major publications, that Homeland Security and Walmart and the Fortune 500 have met secretly.
[01:05:40.027 --> 01:05:48.752]  They've schemed up ways to, quote, get you to submit, neutralize opposition for this cashless control grid.
[01:05:48.772 --> 01:05:55.176]  And then I guess since they got exposed, since they got caught, they've gone ahead and come right out with it.
[01:05:55.276 --> 01:05:56.737]  Reuters reported that in England...
[01:05:57.742 --> 01:05:58.663]  I read this two days ago.
[01:05:58.703 --> 01:06:13.712]  It's on the website, Infowars.com, that in England the police are doing a test in one of their cities of making people put tracker chips, RFID in all their TVs and appliances, and, quote, if they get moved around, the police come.
[01:06:14.532 --> 01:06:15.173]  Isn't that weird?
[01:06:15.233 --> 01:06:17.434]  Oh, because you might as well stop stealing.
[01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:22.037]  See, they take your guns, crime rate explodes, and, oh, there's more stealing.
[01:06:22.077 --> 01:06:23.898]  We've got to make you have chips that track you.
[01:06:24.537 --> 01:06:24.757]  I think?
[01:06:43.655 --> 01:06:54.403]  And it goes on to say, even more chilling, the remains of hundreds of victims are still unaccounted for, leaving many survivors to wonder what happened to them in the final minutes of the disastrous collapse.
[01:06:54.943 --> 01:06:58.045]  But how do you collect information on hundreds, if not thousands, of people?
[01:06:58.686 --> 01:07:01.107]  Are they hurriedly leaving a building during an emergency?
[01:07:01.148 --> 01:07:06.732]  Scientists in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, it's the government, folks, have been working on a solution.
[01:07:06.832 --> 01:07:07.252]  It's called
[01:07:08.166 --> 01:07:16.509]  Evacuation monitoring and accountability system using RFID tracking or embedded chips in the uniforms or ID badges of employees.
[01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:30.913]  And they say that there's going to be a move to make anyone who's working in a building of any real size, the article goes on and on detailing it, to make you, by law, wear one of these badges because it'll save lives.
[01:07:31.413 --> 01:07:34.794]  Man, people would have gotten out of the building and had known who was in there.
[01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:43.613]  Well, yeah, the 47-story FEMA command bunker across the street with the CIA and Giuliani in it.
[01:07:43.633 --> 01:07:44.073]  Remember that?
[01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:47.238]  The building that 5 o'clock in the afternoon blew up and collapsed.
[01:07:48.139 --> 01:07:51.344]  Fell faster than a bowling ball can fall from that height from explosions.
[01:07:52.941 --> 01:07:57.745]  They admit that was the emergency center announcing over the loudspeaker, stay at your desk, stay at your desk.
[01:07:57.805 --> 01:08:03.889]  After the buildings have been hit by the planes, they'd evacuate for some talcum powder on the ground.
[01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:05.931]  But no, not for planes crashing in.
[01:08:06.171 --> 01:08:06.872]  Don't evacuate.
[01:08:06.912 --> 01:08:07.552]  Stay at your desk.
[01:08:07.612 --> 01:08:08.893]  People would run around with bullhorns.
[01:08:08.933 --> 01:08:12.256]  The police, the firefighters, executives were running around with bullhorns.
[01:08:12.496 --> 01:08:12.956]  Get out!
[01:08:13.016 --> 01:08:14.117]  It's a terrorist attack!
[01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:14.978]  Don't listen to it!
[01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:16.559]  The voice, stay where you are.
[01:08:16.619 --> 01:08:17.379]  Disregard that.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.701]  There could be ramifications if you evacuate.
[01:08:19.721 --> 01:08:20.662]  That could cause problems.
[01:08:20.682 --> 01:08:21.402]  Stay right there.
[01:08:21.602 --> 01:08:22.043]  Mm-hmm.
[01:08:23.752 --> 01:08:26.174]  So they're telling you to take your RFID to save you.
[01:08:26.855 --> 01:08:27.395]  It's incredible.
[01:08:27.415 --> 01:08:30.517]  Oh, we've had election problems with the punch card.
[01:08:30.858 --> 01:08:33.240]  We're going to make you go to touch screens with no record.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.021]  And it turns out the CIA runs that.
[01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:36.142]  Mainstream news.
[01:08:37.183 --> 01:08:39.084]  I mean, this is so horrible, folks.
[01:08:39.144 --> 01:08:39.985]  But they go on and on.
[01:08:40.005 --> 01:08:43.788]  Catherine Albrecht, I kind of babbled through those stories, but they're very important.
[01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:48.271]  Have you seen the ABC article or the Reuters article where everything in your house will have chips in it?
[01:08:48.511 --> 01:08:49.292]  Absolutely.
[01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:52.855]  And, you know, this is what we've been talking about for the last year and a half, that it's coming.
[01:08:53.483 --> 01:08:57.075]  And we better brace ourselves, and we've got to fight back, or this is going to be here before we know it.
[01:08:57.436 --> 01:08:59.463]  And just to recap, Catherine, who you are.
[01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:16.738]  Your organization, the big bombshell you dropped two months ago, when the idiots at the RFID Center with MIT and the military and Walmart on their consortium website left their secret documents on the site accessible and how they talked about how to make us submit and all this.
[01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:17.558]  That's very important.
[01:09:17.878 --> 01:09:19.059]  Yeah, incredible stuff.
[01:09:19.099 --> 01:09:21.319]  Well, I founded Caspian.
[01:09:21.339 --> 01:09:26.382]  We're online at nocards.org, and we've got a new RFID site up at stoprfid.com or .org.
[01:09:26.402 --> 01:09:27.502]  You can find it either place.
[01:09:28.078 --> 01:09:37.867]  I founded Caspian in 1999 fighting all forms of retail surveillance and invasion into people's personal privacy by businesses, particularly around the products that they buy.
[01:09:37.887 --> 01:09:41.991]  At that time, we were focused on supermarket cards, which is why our website is at nocards.org.
[01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:50.343]  And in the last year and a half I have really focused my energy and my attention on this emerging radio frequency identification technology.
[01:09:50.803 --> 01:09:54.444]  That's the technology for anyone who is still not aware of it.
[01:09:54.864 --> 01:10:01.626]  It is the use of tiny computer chips to number every item on the planet with its own unique number.
[01:10:02.046 --> 01:10:08.269]  These are supposed to replace the barcode, so they will be on every manufactured item rolling off of every single one.
[01:10:08.289 --> 01:10:11.891]  So it can either buy or sell without that special little digital mark there.
[01:10:12.211 --> 01:10:13.272]  You got it, yeah.
[01:10:13.492 --> 01:10:20.976]  And by the way, you went to one of the open meetings in Chicago with all the industry heads, and they were calling it Babylon System and all these weird terms.
[01:10:21.056 --> 01:10:29.780]  Yeah, in fact, there's some interesting religious terminology around this, and that leads me to what's happening next week, and this will all tie together in a second.
[01:10:30.342 --> 01:10:35.574]  Next week will be the official worldwide launch of what is called the EPC Network.
[01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:39.102]  Now, the EPC stands for Electronic Product Code.
[01:10:39.303 --> 01:10:42.784]  It means the use of these tiny RFID devices to replace the barcode.
[01:10:43.404 --> 01:10:50.928]  The EPC network will be replacing, if they have their say, will be replacing the UPC, that's Universal Product Code, barcode network.
[01:10:50.968 --> 01:10:53.029]  So we're going to switch from UPC to EPC.
[01:10:53.449 --> 01:11:01.953]  The official launch will take place next week, Monday through Wednesday, in Chicago at a convention center, actually the biggest convention center in the country, called McCormick Place.
[01:11:02.493 --> 01:11:05.195]  Business leaders from all around the world will be gathering.
[01:11:05.276 --> 01:11:20.648]  Some of the most powerful power brokers on the planet will be getting together at McCormick Place to pop the champagne corks and pat each other on the back about launching this system that stands to number every item on the planet and make it all trackable via huge databases.
[01:11:20.708 --> 01:11:22.970]  Now, you got their documents two months ago.
[01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:29.155]  They've been denying it, that it is to make us submit, it is to control us, it is for electronic taxation, all of this.
[01:11:29.175 --> 01:11:31.037]  And now...
[01:11:32.012 --> 01:11:34.955]  Now it's in Reuters saying they're going to try to make it the law in England.
[01:11:34.975 --> 01:11:40.600]  That means here to make you have these in all your TVs and stuff so if you move it around the house, the police come.
[01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:49.728]  And then ABC News is saying to go and have a job at a building, well, it's for your safety to have to be wearing one of these.
[01:11:49.768 --> 01:11:55.513]  And it's funny, in Iraq to work for Halliburton, you've got to wear a bracelet that has one of these in it.
[01:11:55.533 --> 01:11:58.176]  I mean, this is literally your dog collar.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:08.326]  Yeah, and the way the technologies are converging, now the folks proposing this technology will say, oh, we want this for our supply chain efficiency.
[01:12:08.346 --> 01:12:16.891]  That means we want to be able to move big crates and shipping crates and things around more efficiently from trucks and boats and warehouses and trains and distribution centers.
[01:12:17.331 --> 01:12:18.412]  Don't worry about it, consumers.
[01:12:18.432 --> 01:12:19.653]  This is all happening behind the scenes.
[01:12:19.673 --> 01:12:21.174]  You don't need to think about it or worry about it.
[01:12:21.574 --> 01:12:27.917]  Meanwhile, what's happening is that since the technology... By the way, these folks have been meeting behind closed doors since 1999.
[01:12:28.278 --> 01:12:32.860]  And you're right, Alex, in saying that we uncovered their confidential internal documents a couple months back.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:38.803]  We discovered in there that they have basically been doing all of this without any input from any consumers or citizens, of course.
[01:12:39.263 --> 01:12:44.106]  That they have conducted extensive research to try to determine the best way to pacify consumers...
[01:12:44.566 --> 01:12:46.627]  The best way to minimize their concerns.
[01:12:47.007 --> 01:12:52.889]  They've talked about doing research in which they discovered that hopefully people will remain apathetic about the technology.
[01:12:52.909 --> 01:12:56.711]  Yeah, they say the people don't like this, but it doesn't matter.
[01:12:56.731 --> 01:12:57.471]  They're apathetic.
[01:12:57.491 --> 01:12:58.571]  They won't do anything.
[01:12:58.652 --> 01:13:00.632]  We've just got to push over them.
[01:13:00.732 --> 01:13:10.116]  Well, and two of the pieces of advice they got from their public relations firm, Fleischman Hillard, was, number one, emphasize to the media whenever you talk about this technology that it's inevitable.
[01:13:10.994 --> 01:13:12.915]  Resistance is futile.
[01:13:12.975 --> 01:13:13.595]  You get it.
[01:13:13.695 --> 01:13:14.176]  Exactly.
[01:13:14.276 --> 01:13:15.196]  You know, it's inevitable.
[01:13:15.256 --> 01:13:15.676]  It's coming.
[01:13:15.696 --> 01:13:16.837]  There's no sense fighting it.
[01:13:16.857 --> 01:13:18.257]  You know, nothing to see here, folks.
[01:13:18.277 --> 01:13:18.477]  Move along.
[01:13:18.497 --> 01:13:20.098]  Well, that's the same pitch for the EU.
[01:13:20.478 --> 01:13:21.819]  To England, it's inevitable.
[01:13:21.879 --> 01:13:22.819]  Submit to us.
[01:13:22.959 --> 01:13:24.160]  Nothing and stop us.
[01:13:24.938 --> 01:13:29.461]  Yeah, this inevitability argument has really been, I mean, I think it's proven quite effective for them.
[01:13:29.481 --> 01:13:37.666]  Well, I mean, that's what Tokyo Rose would say over the shortwave every night was, G.I., you won't be seeing your sweetheart.
[01:13:37.966 --> 01:13:38.987]  We've defeated you.
[01:13:39.227 --> 01:13:40.568]  There's no way to win.
[01:13:40.628 --> 01:13:42.369]  You're never going to make it.
[01:13:42.849 --> 01:13:43.830]  You can't fight us.
[01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:45.351]  There's nothing you can do.
[01:13:46.434 --> 01:13:49.538]  Yeah, there's that very subtle, powerful message.
[01:13:49.578 --> 01:13:58.529]  And I'm so sick of being in the grocery store, Catherine, and having 30 people stop me who watch the TV show and go, Alex, Alex, you're so right, but no one cares, and we're going to lose!
[01:13:58.549 --> 01:14:00.591]  And I'm like, there's 20 of you right here.
[01:14:00.992 --> 01:14:02.193]  I can't even buy my groceries.
[01:14:02.213 --> 01:14:03.335]  You guys go be leaders.
[01:14:04.076 --> 01:14:05.337]  You know, it's absolutely true.
[01:14:05.637 --> 01:14:11.644]  Well, let me tell you why I think this particular issue is really a... No, there's nothing you can do, Catherine.
[01:14:11.684 --> 01:14:12.025]  Shut up!
[01:14:12.986 --> 01:14:14.568]  Stop trying to stand up for freedom.
[01:14:14.588 --> 01:14:15.449]  There's nothing you can do.
[01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:20.695]  Well, I've been working on freedom-related causes for about five years of my life now, Alex.
[01:14:20.955 --> 01:14:21.035]  No.
[01:14:22.017 --> 01:14:26.300]  This is the first one that I have come across that I think we've got broad enough... No!
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:26.620]  No!
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.782]  From the left, from the right... You can't defeat the Patriot Act either!
[01:14:29.862 --> 01:14:30.602]  It doesn't matter!
[01:14:31.743 --> 01:14:33.804]  From... You know, let me tell you this.
[01:14:33.904 --> 01:14:40.808]  From their own internal documents, we learned that 78% of people oppose this technology on privacy grounds.
[01:14:40.828 --> 01:14:41.089]  78% of people...
[01:14:45.271 --> 01:14:53.676]  Well, that's the last thing they want us to find out, because if we find out that we are in not only the majority, but the overwhelming majority... That's what I said last hour.
[01:14:53.696 --> 01:14:58.299]  I mean, we are in a position to stop this dead in its tracks.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.060]  Absolutely.
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:14:59.860]  Well, it's all of it.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.101]  Nobody likes the cameras.
[01:15:01.141 --> 01:15:08.446]  It's like 87% don't like the borders open, including like 83% of Hispanics who try to make it a racial issue, but still they're open.
[01:15:09.148 --> 01:15:11.349]  It's like 80-something percent are against NAFTA and GATT.
[01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:12.570]  It's still there.
[01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:15.212]  Well, but you know the difference about that, Alex, is borders.
[01:15:15.332 --> 01:15:17.193]  You know, borders are down in the southern states.
[01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:18.934]  They don't affect people in Michigan.
[01:15:18.954 --> 01:15:22.656]  They don't affect people in, you know, I don't know, Kansas and Oklahoma.
[01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:30.281]  This issue here, the issue of RFID in products affects every single person on the planet because you cannot, you can't live...
[01:15:30.541 --> 01:15:33.923]  I mean, let's face it, in today's modern world, you can't live without buying and selling things.
[01:15:33.943 --> 01:15:34.503]  You have to.
[01:15:34.684 --> 01:15:39.006]  And they're putting in the infrastructure of total enslavement, and you're exposing that.
[01:15:39.066 --> 01:15:45.190]  You were on the key cutting edge of a vital salvo against their architecture.
[01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:48.723]  Absolutely.
[01:15:48.903 --> 01:15:54.287]  You're firing proton torpedoes down the reactor vent shaft here on the Death Star.
[01:15:54.307 --> 01:15:55.248]  We're doing our best.
[01:15:55.308 --> 01:15:55.909]  We're doing our best.
[01:15:55.949 --> 01:15:57.690]  Let me tell you two things that people can do.
[01:15:58.491 --> 01:16:04.355]  First of all, I have filmed two videos that people can use to get the information out about this.
[01:16:04.415 --> 01:16:07.637]  The first one is an overview of RFID.
[01:16:07.657 --> 01:16:09.939]  It's called RFID Tracking Everything Everywhere.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:11.180]  We don't sell those.
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.962]  I actually filmed those in conjunction with End Time Ministries.
[01:16:13.982 --> 01:16:14.683]  They flew me out.
[01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:18.285]  And you can get a copy of that by dialing 1-800-END-TIME.
[01:16:18.505 --> 01:16:22.627]  And in one hour, you can sit people down and give them the whole overview of what this technology is.
[01:16:23.127 --> 01:16:30.271]  And it sounds like a break's coming up, but when we come back from it, I'm going to talk about a way people in Chicago can turn out and change this thing right next week.
[01:16:30.991 --> 01:16:32.852]  All right, yeah, the protest's coming up.
[01:16:32.892 --> 01:16:33.692]  Stay there, Catherine.
[01:16:34.553 --> 01:16:37.514]  I'm Alex Jones, fighting the RFID.
[01:16:38.395 --> 01:16:40.836]  Resistance is futile!
[01:16:44.136 --> 01:16:48.640]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:53.083]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:53.383 --> 01:16:53.924]  We listened.
[01:16:54.224 --> 01:16:59.208]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:59.488 --> 01:16:59.969]  We listened.
[01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:03.391]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:04.372]  We listened.
[01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:07.875]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:17:07.875 --> 01:17:11.158]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennia
[01:17:35.191 --> 01:17:36.332]  We're good to go.
[01:17:59.369 --> 01:18:00.010]  We're good to go.
[01:18:19.565 --> 01:18:20.225]  We're good to go.
[01:18:41.974 --> 01:18:45.877]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:58.386]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:18:58.806 --> 01:18:59.226]  The U.S.
[01:18:59.266 --> 01:19:04.850]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:07.452]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:09.313 --> 01:19:09.774]  We're good to go.
[01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.590]  We're good to go.
[01:19:41.614 --> 01:19:46.057]  Get Body Balance, the leading phytonutrient product on the planet by Lifeforce International.

[01:20:49.825 --> 01:20:52.207]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:20:53.848 --> 01:20:57.811]  All right, coming up in the next segment, I will go to Melissa, Bill, Ron...
[01:20:59.298 --> 01:21:05.063]  Ken, Clive, a bunch of other people that are patiently holding.
[01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:07.505]  We're going to go to North Korea.
[01:21:07.565 --> 01:21:09.427]  It's very important, some other key issues.
[01:21:10.027 --> 01:21:11.649]  September 11th and the propaganda.
[01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:20.176]  But we're talking to Catherine Albrecht, and she's there at Harvard and does research on the New World Order, basically, on their cashless society control grid.
[01:21:20.957 --> 01:21:24.220]  The globals are having a big meeting to dominate us and to make us submit.
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:28.643]  And we're going to talk about how you can go and protest that and get involved.
[01:21:28.743 --> 01:21:37.431]  And so they know that we're aware of what they're up to and that we're not going to stop and hopefully derail this in its infancy.
[01:21:37.572 --> 01:21:44.858]  And, of course, it's the government that developed it and is behind it and shepherding all of it as a way to track and trace and tax you.
[01:21:45.879 --> 01:21:46.680]  But, Catherine?
[01:21:47.578 --> 01:21:49.779]  Talking about, this is a big deal.
[01:21:49.839 --> 01:21:53.420]  Just a few months ago they were saying, oh, we're never going to track you outside your house with it.
[01:21:53.721 --> 01:21:54.541]  That's totally made up.
[01:21:54.581 --> 01:21:59.103]  Now the documents are there that it is outside the store.
[01:21:59.183 --> 01:22:00.243]  It is outside your house.
[01:22:00.323 --> 01:22:01.223]  It is in your house.
[01:22:01.944 --> 01:22:03.164]  Now it's in ABC News.
[01:22:03.284 --> 01:22:04.225]  Now it's in the Reuters.
[01:22:04.265 --> 01:22:05.245]  How good it is.
[01:22:05.505 --> 01:22:07.926]  We all need these on us to make sure we're safe.
[01:22:08.406 --> 01:22:11.547]  Oh, yeah, a more sophisticated one's in your cell phone to triangulate you.
[01:22:12.008 --> 01:22:12.988]  That's the cover of U.S.
[01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:13.868]  News and World Report.
[01:22:14.048 --> 01:22:15.289]  They're everywhere pushing this.
[01:22:17.159 --> 01:22:28.768]  Well, and that is one of their actual strategic tactics is to emphasize the importance of this from a security perspective because what they learned the hard way is that consumers hate this technology.
[01:22:28.808 --> 01:22:40.817]  Like I said before the break, 78% of people, according to their own internal research, now they didn't want this leaked out because they don't want the world knowing this, but 78% of people they polled opposed this technology on privacy grounds.
[01:22:41.198 --> 01:22:46.862]  So they're going to have to come up with something, and it's going to have to be a real doozy in order to get people to overcome that resistance.
[01:22:47.223 --> 01:22:47.464]  Thank you.
[01:22:52.319 --> 01:23:17.928]  And putting a reader device in your refrigerator that would communicate the contents of your refrigerator over the Internet to public health officials, to your grocery store, to who knows who, so that every time you took the carton of milk out of the refrigerator, someone would be, you know, a little note in a database would be made of, you know, 315, I took out the milk, I took out the... And folks, this is like, this is, I heard THX 1138, the George Lucas film, last night in Houston, that's, they have cameras in the refrigerators.
[01:23:18.826 --> 01:23:19.527]  I think so.
[01:23:42.666 --> 01:23:51.113]  Every physical item somehow able to be read at a distance identified in its entire purchase history and who it's registered to could be identified.
[01:23:51.714 --> 01:24:03.043]  That's really an extraordinarily powerful technology and if this falls into the hands of people who would abuse it and as you and I know whenever there's too much power it inevitably falls into the hands of those who would abuse it.
[01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:07.707]  This could be abused not only by corporations who would like to use it to market to us and
[01:24:08.018 --> 01:24:08.778]  Thank you very much.
[01:24:23.784 --> 01:24:27.087]  Which can be read right through your wallet or purse from 20 feet away.
[01:24:27.347 --> 01:24:29.769]  Could identify who you are as you walk into the store.
[01:24:30.189 --> 01:24:38.435]  IBM has a similar device that they want to put in your checkbook or your ATM card so that as you walk into the bank, the bank doorway would identify you and communicate.
[01:24:38.475 --> 01:24:47.362]  And they've had that ad years ago, two or three years ago, preparing us where the guy goes in, it looks like he's stealing stuff, but then he walks out and gets scanned and the guy walks over and gives him his receipt.
[01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:48.663]  You know, the security guard does this.
[01:24:48.703 --> 01:24:49.264]  Thank you, sir.
[01:24:49.904 --> 01:24:51.364]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:51.424 --> 01:24:54.665]  Right, he's following him and you think he's going to arrest him and he says, oh, you forgot your receipts there.
[01:24:55.005 --> 01:24:58.266]  You know, it's the same idea, but not just on the way out of the store, but on the way into the store.
[01:24:58.286 --> 01:25:11.829]  Imagine going into the bank and the bank teller, before you even walk through the door or come, you know, it's the minute you walk through the door, they have right on their screen, oh, here comes Susan Peterson and she's only got $32 in her bank account.
[01:25:11.849 --> 01:25:12.249]  You know what, we...
[01:25:13.529 --> 01:25:16.350]  We probably, you know, I think I can take my break now.
[01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:16.810]  Exactly.
[01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:19.931]  Hey, real quick, Catherine, because we're almost out of time.
[01:25:20.131 --> 01:25:21.592]  The protest is next week.
[01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:23.152]  Tell them the time and place again.
[01:25:23.172 --> 01:25:24.072]  Let me give you details.
[01:25:24.132 --> 01:25:30.214]  Those of you in Chicago, I'm going to give you a telephone number where you can call, and I would ask, because I know, Alex, you have a huge listenership.
[01:25:30.254 --> 01:25:31.095]  I love your audience.
[01:25:31.215 --> 01:25:35.936]  If you want to communicate with us, go to our website at nocards.org and fill out the feedback form.
[01:25:36.236 --> 01:25:38.277]  This phone number is really for folks in Chicago.
[01:25:38.777 --> 01:25:38.937]  It's 877-2877.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:45.863]  And this is also important, so the media can't just go out and do a puff piece.
[01:25:45.943 --> 01:25:48.545]  They'll have to mention there were protesters.
[01:26:03.056 --> 01:26:09.217]  Absolutely, and in fact, we have actually quite a good relationship with the media, and a number of media outlets have already contacted us.
[01:26:09.257 --> 01:26:09.497]  Good.
[01:26:09.577 --> 01:26:12.938]  Real quick, give that number out again, Catherine.
[01:26:13.358 --> 01:26:15.278]  That number is 877-287-5854.
[01:26:15.438 --> 01:26:16.798]  Okay, we're out of time, Catherine.
[01:26:16.818 --> 01:26:19.339]  I'll have you back on soon after the protest.
[01:26:19.359 --> 01:26:20.219]  I want to get the tales of it.
[01:26:20.239 --> 01:26:23.120]  I want to talk to you during the break, so let me put you on hold.
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:24.340]  I'll talk to you during the break.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.820]  Then, folks, we're going to come back and take your calls again to other news.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.361]  Catherine Albrecht, NoCards.org.
[01:26:28.841 --> 01:26:30.381]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:33.967]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.447 --> 01:26:36.068]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.988 --> 01:26:39.788]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:46.769]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:26:47.009 --> 01:26:48.450]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:50.350]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:55.651]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect... $18 for only $3.99 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:26:55.691 --> 01:26:57.231]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:27:18.479 --> 01:27:20.781]  All right, my friends, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:27:21.001 --> 01:27:31.008]  By the way, I didn't have time to get into the fact that the documents they got that are public, the RFID Center and MIT and the government and others have responded to it.
[01:27:31.068 --> 01:27:32.929]  Yes, she got their documents.
[01:27:33.630 --> 01:27:44.677]  Talks about suppressing you, talks about how to neutralize your opposition, how to neutralize you, folks, how to get the control grid in, as the PNAC document that we read yesterday said.
[01:27:45.618 --> 01:27:46.919]  The global control grid.
[01:27:47.739 --> 01:27:48.159]  Hi, Alex.
[01:27:48.179 --> 01:27:48.339]  Welcome.
[01:28:16.407 --> 01:28:20.968]  I know you must be familiar with obelisks, since you know so much about symbolism.
[01:28:21.188 --> 01:28:21.648]  Obelisk?
[01:28:22.028 --> 01:28:23.629]  Yeah.
[01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:34.531]  Yeah, it's what's in downtown D.C., it's what's in San Jacinto, Texas, they're in Egypt, they're in France, they're in England, and it's the symbol of...
[01:28:37.210 --> 01:28:44.196]  The male god, which translates into Lucifer, I mean, that's just the Egyptian folks in the Hebrew.
[01:28:44.817 --> 01:28:50.282]  And I'm not going to tell, because we've got kids listening, exactly what it symbolizes, but we have children listening.
[01:28:51.163 --> 01:28:55.167]  I know that there's one in Dealey Plaza, Mark, where Kennedy was killed.
[01:28:55.567 --> 01:28:56.288]  They always do.
[01:28:56.308 --> 01:28:57.268]  Same thing with Diana.
[01:28:57.288 --> 01:28:58.870]  Same thing with all of them.
[01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:00.972]  When they do one of those hits...
[01:29:01.716 --> 01:29:07.582]  They leave that, and a lot of times there's a burning torch, too, atop it, which is double meaning.
[01:29:08.123 --> 01:29:10.725]  Exactly, and that's exactly what I've discovered.
[01:29:12.067 --> 01:29:24.880]  Not only that, I was watching all the stuff on TV yesterday, of course, about 9-11, and I was very surprised when they talked about there's a black obelisk with the victim's name inscribed.
[01:29:25.871 --> 01:29:27.531]  And that really shocked me.
[01:29:27.551 --> 01:29:28.372]  A black obelisk.
[01:29:28.452 --> 01:29:28.972]  How nice.
[01:29:29.092 --> 01:29:31.593]  It doesn't really shock me, you know, to know how they are.
[01:29:31.613 --> 01:29:35.634]  There's a satanic symbol with their names inscribed.
[01:29:35.674 --> 01:29:36.854]  Isn't that sweet?
[01:29:37.354 --> 01:29:38.114]  God read that.
[01:29:38.734 --> 01:29:40.095]  Okay, and it just made me sick.
[01:29:41.055 --> 01:29:42.876]  Oh, yeah, it's right out in plain view.
[01:29:42.936 --> 01:29:50.398]  And then I read another... And by the way, you notice when you see the Masons or... Oh, man.
[01:29:51.378 --> 01:29:53.558]  Wow, and he won't back down, guys.
[01:29:53.578 --> 01:29:54.219]  You heard him.
[01:29:54.259 --> 01:29:54.719]  He's back.
[01:29:56.957 --> 01:29:59.939]  But, I kind of got my off thought there.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:06.104]  But you notice that when you see the higher level masonry people, they have the obelisk as they don't have a cross.
[01:30:06.344 --> 01:30:07.725]  It's an obelisk because they're tombstone.
[01:30:08.045 --> 01:30:09.366]  You notice those are never black.
[01:30:10.107 --> 01:30:19.734]  And I actually researched what a black obelisk means, and it generally means that the Illuminati has put a hit out on someone and that this was a sacrifice.
[01:30:20.514 --> 01:30:22.616]  Now, when you look,
[01:30:24.008 --> 01:30:29.030]  At Princess Diana, at one of their palaces, they have a memorial.
[01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:30.150]  The royal family does.
[01:30:30.170 --> 01:30:30.831]  You've had her killed.
[01:30:30.851 --> 01:30:38.413]  That's even mainstream news in England because she'd gotten pregnant by the royal guy out of Egypt.
[01:30:40.074 --> 01:30:48.037]  But they have a black obelisk there with black swans and a bizarre black mortuary.
[01:30:48.997 --> 01:30:50.017]  Yeah, isn't that nice?
[01:30:50.437 --> 01:30:52.038]  Yeah, I read about that too.
[01:30:52.058 --> 01:30:52.198]  Yeah.
[01:30:53.175 --> 01:31:10.763]  Another thing I wanted to say is that just today I found a site where it was a proposed design for building a memorial at the World Trade Center site.
[01:31:10.803 --> 01:31:11.143]  Yes.
[01:31:11.823 --> 01:31:21.007]  And I don't know if this is the one they've chosen or have they chosen one, but I wanted to read just a little bit on this site and maybe people can go there.
[01:31:21.027 --> 01:31:21.768]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:31:23.792 --> 01:31:25.414]  It's really disgusting to me.
[01:31:25.514 --> 01:31:33.185]  It says, if you go there, it's at newyorkacropolis.org is the site.
[01:31:34.046 --> 01:31:40.275]  And it says, if you click on rituals, which you know these people are so into rituals.
[01:31:41.839 --> 01:31:42.860]  The New World Order people.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:43.700]  And it says rituals.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:44.841]  I've seen what they've got out there.
[01:31:44.881 --> 01:31:49.665]  There's all these weird symbols and weird pyramids and weird occult stuff everywhere they're now.
[01:31:49.746 --> 01:31:51.667]  And they love flaunting it.
[01:31:52.068 --> 01:31:56.912]  This is supposed to be, you know, a tribute to the people that died, a memorial to them.
[01:31:56.992 --> 01:31:58.693]  But to me, it's just the opposite.
[01:31:58.733 --> 01:31:59.834]  Okay, so it says rituals.
[01:31:59.874 --> 01:32:00.335]  Go ahead.
[01:32:00.355 --> 01:32:07.201]  Yes, and it says, These rituals are designed to bypass thinking so all energy can go into feeling.
[01:32:07.782 --> 01:32:12.385]  Before that, he talks about, this is the person, I guess, that designed the whole thing.
[01:32:12.405 --> 01:32:17.049]  It says, The site has become a spontaneous point of worldwide pilgrimage.
[01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:20.251]  Crowds can disrupt the sanctity of the shrine.
[01:32:20.832 --> 01:32:27.617]  This design can accommodate the thousands of daily pilgrims and still preserve a secluded and silent center.
[01:32:28.197 --> 01:32:34.362]  To visit the shrine, one becomes a pilgrim, an open-hearted explorer of hallowed ground.
[01:32:34.942 --> 01:32:37.124]  The site is charged, listen to this,
[01:32:37.645 --> 01:32:40.108]  With tremendous emotional power.
[01:32:40.128 --> 01:32:42.070]  To me, they feed off of your fear.
[01:32:42.611 --> 01:32:45.834]  Oh, no, that's what a Satanist does when they kill somebody, yeah.
[01:32:46.114 --> 01:32:50.519]  And it says the fitting structure will amplify and focus that power.
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:52.581]  Okay, then you click on rituals.
[01:32:52.621 --> 01:32:54.504]  That's on the homepage at the bottom.
[01:32:54.604 --> 01:32:56.606]  Then you click on the rituals and it goes on and says...
[01:32:57.352 --> 01:33:01.553]  Basically, you're becoming a pilgrim ascending to Central Sean.
[01:33:01.653 --> 01:33:04.354]  And it's about turning your brain off and being part of the, yeah.
[01:33:04.374 --> 01:33:06.454]  Listen to this little book.
[01:33:06.694 --> 01:33:07.495]  It gets really sick.
[01:33:07.555 --> 01:33:12.356]  It says, you're walking in a series of clockwise spirals as one ventures deep into the park.
[01:33:12.396 --> 01:33:15.657]  A parallel journey occurs on the inside of the visitor.
[01:33:15.677 --> 01:33:19.698]  The pilgrim's awareness shifts from the head to the heart.
[01:33:20.158 --> 01:33:21.358]  Pilgrimage Instructions.
[01:33:22.165 --> 01:33:28.729]  Circumnavigate the perimeter of the entire park to get a sense of the magnitude of the sacrifice.
[01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:31.171]  Notice the word sacrifice.
[01:33:32.449 --> 01:33:37.154]  Of course, Bush said it's a sacrifice, and there will be more sacrifices, he said in a speech.
[01:33:37.474 --> 01:33:42.078]  He held up that police officer's badge and said, this was a sacrifice, and there will be more.
[01:33:42.098 --> 01:33:53.748]  Just like in Bohemian Grove, where they sacrificed what they did to Moloch, and just like Hitler sacrificed all the people he killed in the Evans, that was a burnt sacrifice.
[01:33:54.048 --> 01:33:55.129]  Well, that's what they do.
[01:33:55.369 --> 01:33:55.949]  All of this.
[01:33:56.410 --> 01:33:58.251]  And this last part, and then I'm going to stop.
[01:33:58.311 --> 01:34:10.740]  It says, Observe the four green fields and their centerpiece sculptures, the skeletal wall fragment, the crushed fire engine, the twisted girders, and the adorned last standing column.
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:14.182]  I'm not even going to go on, but that's just, to me, disgusting.
[01:34:14.302 --> 01:34:15.663]  New York Acropolis?
[01:34:16.043 --> 01:34:16.924]  Yes, .org.
[01:34:17.754 --> 01:34:18.115]  New York.
[01:34:18.135 --> 01:34:19.177]  How do you spell Acropolis?
[01:34:19.197 --> 01:34:20.559]  It's A-C-R-O-P-O-L-I-S dot org.
[01:34:27.409 --> 01:34:28.650]  And it's the word New York.
[01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:31.852]  I'll get a link to that up on Infowars.com in the next 30 minutes or so.
[01:34:32.032 --> 01:34:36.135]  Okay, it is the word New York, and it says a memorial design proposal for the World Trade Center.
[01:34:36.155 --> 01:34:38.076]  Well, look, I mean, I went and looked at a lot of those.
[01:34:39.257 --> 01:34:50.605]  When it got down to, like, nine designs, one of them was the Reichstag Rebuilders, and, of course, it was a British company that controlled demolition that was involved in Oklahoma City, tearing that down and burying it under concrete at a...
[01:34:51.465 --> 01:34:52.426]  Guarded landfill.
[01:34:52.627 --> 01:34:56.571]  They're the same ones that tore this down and shipped it to China, and the firefighters said it was a cover-up.
[01:34:56.611 --> 01:34:57.773]  That was New York Daily News.
[01:34:59.495 --> 01:35:00.696]  Y'all looked at a lot of designs.
[01:35:00.877 --> 01:35:01.678]  Very occult.
[01:35:03.638 --> 01:35:08.282]  But you say that you were watching the news and they said they've got the black, and I remember seeing that.
[01:35:08.302 --> 01:35:09.864]  Yeah, they mentioned the black obelisk.
[01:35:10.064 --> 01:35:11.225]  The black obelisk.
[01:35:11.465 --> 01:35:14.208]  And that it has all the names inscribed of the victims.
[01:35:14.368 --> 01:35:17.791]  I didn't necessarily see it, but I did hear them say it.
[01:35:17.831 --> 01:35:18.592]  I remember reading that.
[01:35:18.912 --> 01:35:19.893]  Well, hey, thanks for the call.
[01:35:19.913 --> 01:35:20.554]  That's interesting.
[01:35:20.594 --> 01:35:21.755]  Can I say one more thing, Alex?
[01:35:21.775 --> 01:35:22.496]  I've got to let you go.
[01:35:22.536 --> 01:35:22.976]  I'm sorry.
[01:35:23.217 --> 01:35:24.338]  I've got to be fair to the callers.
[01:35:24.378 --> 01:35:26.139]  That's what's been happening is we're not getting to the callers.
[01:35:26.319 --> 01:35:26.600]  Okay.
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:27.701]  Thank you.
[01:35:27.801 --> 01:35:29.444]  I just, yeah, I've got to cut people off.
[01:35:29.624 --> 01:35:31.547]  There's always one more thing, one more thing, and I'm the same way.
[01:35:31.567 --> 01:35:32.488]  I just never get to the callers.
[01:35:32.508 --> 01:35:35.913]  Bill, Bill, where are you calling us from?
[01:35:36.113 --> 01:35:37.756]  I'm calling from Fayetteville, Arkansas.
[01:35:37.956 --> 01:35:38.337]  Welcome.
[01:35:38.677 --> 01:35:39.158]  Yeah, welcome.
[01:35:39.198 --> 01:35:40.500]  I was listening to you yesterday.
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:41.822]  I called into the Frank show, too.
[01:35:43.505 --> 01:35:44.886]  That you were on the AMX yesterday?
[01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:45.666]  Oh, yes, sir.
[01:35:45.726 --> 01:35:46.307]  Yesterday morning.
[01:35:46.327 --> 01:35:46.827]  Great show.
[01:35:47.047 --> 01:35:47.287]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:47.307 --> 01:35:51.169]  I was the one that called in and talked about George Bush and everything worshipping Molech and stuff.
[01:35:51.469 --> 01:35:55.912]  Well, the world admits that Bush goes there, and they admit I shot video of the ritual worshipping Molech.
[01:35:56.292 --> 01:35:59.774]  That's national TV admits it, and they say it's no big deal to worship Molech.
[01:36:00.034 --> 01:36:03.476]  Well, of course not, because if you're against that, you're anti-American, right?
[01:36:03.576 --> 01:36:05.937]  I mean, you know, it's crazy to be against somebody worshipping an owl.
[01:36:05.957 --> 01:36:09.359]  You're not a Christian conservative if you don't worship the most demonic demon of the Old Testament.
[01:36:09.959 --> 01:36:12.861]  Right, but I just want to make a few quick voices
[01:36:13.681 --> 01:36:21.163]  Today I was watching the news and I saw something where they were saying that some people were trying to get it passed where you'd have to have an ID to surf the Internet now.
[01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:23.283]  They said you have an ID.
[01:36:23.383 --> 01:36:25.624]  Oh, yeah, Orrin Hatch and others have got that bill.
[01:36:25.664 --> 01:36:28.664]  You're going to have to have an ID when you surf the Internet.
[01:36:29.405 --> 01:36:29.725]  Right.
[01:36:29.985 --> 01:36:30.845]  They said, well, it's simple.
[01:36:30.865 --> 01:36:33.485]  You have to have an ID to drive your car and an ID to do this.
[01:36:33.866 --> 01:36:34.446]  And that will be?
[01:36:36.946 --> 01:36:39.713]  Again, all the way to tax you as well.
[01:36:39.793 --> 01:36:45.827]  And so now, using a virtual server or browser, you don't want to be tracked or given cookies or all this stuff.
[01:36:46.589 --> 01:36:46.889]  Now...
[01:36:48.104 --> 01:36:49.565]  That's going to be considered hacking.
[01:36:49.665 --> 01:36:50.045]  Oh, yeah.
[01:36:50.406 --> 01:36:56.450]  Right, and you know what I'm thinking is if you start looking at certain sites, like maybe InfoWars or something, they'll tag you or something, you know.
[01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:57.250]  Tag you?
[01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.790]  What do you mean?
[01:36:57.930 --> 01:37:02.013]  Well, I mean, like, they'll write that down that, well, he was looking at InfoWars.
[01:37:02.353 --> 01:37:06.236]  Well, sir, where's their personnel to track down the tens of millions of people that are aware of them?
[01:37:06.536 --> 01:37:07.557]  They don't have the power.
[01:37:07.817 --> 01:37:08.657]  We're the majority.
[01:37:09.038 --> 01:37:09.338]  They...
[01:37:10.038 --> 01:37:10.919]  Right, because, I mean, people...
[01:37:30.015 --> 01:37:30.456]  We're good to go.
[01:37:42.875 --> 01:37:43.496]  Well, I didn't know that.
[01:37:43.516 --> 01:37:44.897]  I said, well, go check it out.
[01:37:44.917 --> 01:37:47.439]  All the documentation is in mainstream news.
[01:37:47.759 --> 01:37:51.603]  I said, you can go to MSNBC.com, go to your mainstream news.
[01:37:51.623 --> 01:37:53.564]  It's in their little back articles.
[01:37:53.624 --> 01:37:55.546]  And people start thinking, well, that doesn't sound right.
[01:37:56.046 --> 01:37:56.887]  That doesn't sound right.
[01:37:56.907 --> 01:37:59.429]  They don't think that symbols on our money is right.
[01:37:59.489 --> 01:38:01.231]  And people start waking up.
[01:38:01.271 --> 01:38:04.113]  But it just takes people to go out there and not be embarrassed.
[01:38:04.133 --> 01:38:07.016]  Yeah, why does it say New World Order with a pyramid on the back and
[01:38:08.414 --> 01:38:10.637]  That's really disturbing there in the dollar bill.
[01:38:10.658 --> 01:38:11.719]  Is that what you're talking about?
[01:38:11.759 --> 01:38:12.220]  Yeah.
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:13.602]  Yeah, on the back.
[01:38:13.662 --> 01:38:18.368]  They've got that satanic symbol on the back.
[01:38:18.729 --> 01:38:21.272]  Look, there's little cobwebs and daemons all over it.
[01:38:21.993 --> 01:38:25.278]  You've got a magnifying glass, folks, and look at the money.
[01:38:25.976 --> 01:38:28.857]  Yeah, and everybody, you know, they talk about there's an owl, too, on there.
[01:38:29.298 --> 01:38:29.778]  Oh, there is.
[01:38:29.798 --> 01:38:32.619]  A little owl looking over to little demons with horns.
[01:38:32.899 --> 01:38:33.840]  And by the way, that's all admitted.
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:35.721]  There's books on the stuff on the currency.
[01:38:36.021 --> 01:38:37.121]  They admit all that stuff's there.
[01:38:37.161 --> 01:38:39.182]  It's not like we're just saying it's there and it's not.
[01:38:39.522 --> 01:38:45.065]  Right, and then you got on the... But any little devils and owls on the money, it's no big deal.
[01:38:45.165 --> 01:38:45.885]  Oh, no, of course not.
[01:38:45.925 --> 01:38:47.566]  We must be anti-American for talking like that.
[01:38:47.586 --> 01:38:49.927]  Well, yeah, it says in God we trust, in Moloch we trust.
[01:38:50.127 --> 01:38:51.788]  You ever heard of that Michael Savage?
[01:38:53.528 --> 01:38:55.930]  Yeah, the biggest liberal out there, yeah.
[01:38:56.050 --> 01:39:00.813]  Yeah, I was listening to his show one day, and he wanted people to be put in concentration camps for protesting.
[01:39:01.753 --> 01:39:04.735]  He said that they should just round them all up and put them in concentration camps.
[01:39:05.436 --> 01:39:08.338]  I guess so, but I just wanted to make one real quick point to
[01:39:33.962 --> 01:39:34.863]  You know, it's awful.
[01:39:35.043 --> 01:39:38.586]  These occult people, these dates are very important to them.
[01:39:38.667 --> 01:39:41.769]  I mean, I know you've talked about it before, and it's just like for Hitler.
[01:39:42.030 --> 01:39:43.491]  You know, he was very into the occult.
[01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:48.015]  And George Bush Sr., 10 years before the day of 9-11, I know you have it on your tape.
[01:39:48.536 --> 01:39:50.878]  It's important that people watch that tape and realize that.
[01:39:50.898 --> 01:39:58.505]  He said he's in the Senate right there, the Congress or whatever, and he's talking about wanting to have a new world order 10 years before 9-11 happened.
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:04.644]  Out of these troubled times, a new world order can emerge.
[01:40:05.565 --> 01:40:12.050]  And Gary Hart at the CFR, we need to use this disaster to what the President called for, a new world order.
[01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.691]  Thanks for the call.
[01:40:12.711 --> 01:40:14.573]  Good to hear from you, Bill.
[01:40:15.774 --> 01:40:20.378]  Let's talk to Ken in Kansas, and then we'll talk to Claude in Colorado.
[01:40:20.418 --> 01:40:21.098]  Ken, go ahead.
[01:40:21.999 --> 01:40:26.703]  Yeah, Alex, I just had a couple of points and a question I wanted to make.
[01:40:28.795 --> 01:40:40.810]  As far as the tower being brought down, I saw that on TV, and that was more than just the planes crashing into the buildings.
[01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:44.234]  So that did involve explosions.
[01:40:45.003 --> 01:40:45.963]  Well, of course they did.
[01:40:45.983 --> 01:40:48.144]  You can watch the mainstream news and see the explosions.
[01:40:48.164 --> 01:40:52.546]  But again, The Magician is about what you saw at the time, not seeing the sleight of hand.
[01:40:52.886 --> 01:40:58.509]  Later you think back, I saw him flash his hand, but well... And he's like, no, it's really magic!
[01:40:58.989 --> 01:40:59.229]  Yeah.
[01:40:59.689 --> 01:41:02.971]  Well, I saw that on TV, so they're not going to convince me otherwise.
[01:41:04.226 --> 01:41:05.587]  Well, it's like Oklahoma City were there.
[01:41:05.867 --> 01:41:07.729]  I have footage of them removing the bombs.
[01:41:07.789 --> 01:41:10.090]  The building's blown out across the street.
[01:41:10.991 --> 01:41:13.493]  Pillars further back are blown out than pillars up front.
[01:41:14.313 --> 01:41:16.094]  Seismographs show two explosions.
[01:41:17.055 --> 01:41:21.998]  The police admit, we've got them in the film, that the BATF said, yeah, we were warned not to go to work today.
[01:41:22.479 --> 01:41:23.859]  None of the BATF was in the building.
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:29.643]  Jane Graham, the head of HUD, saw white men planting large gray sticks of butter on the support columns that morning.
[01:41:30.344 --> 01:41:32.906]  On and on and on and on and on.
[01:41:33.966 --> 01:41:34.887]  Ignore that!
[01:41:35.428 --> 01:41:35.688]  Yeah.
[01:41:36.248 --> 01:41:42.534]  Well, as far as your previous guest you had on, he could check into that price chopper.
[01:41:43.215 --> 01:41:46.738]  We have him here where I live, here in Kansas City.
[01:41:47.619 --> 01:41:51.402]  And they've got this tracking stuff and all that going on.
[01:41:51.422 --> 01:41:53.544]  Well, how about you check into it and report back to us?
[01:41:54.144 --> 01:41:54.865]  Yeah, okay.
[01:41:54.885 --> 01:41:56.907]  Because I can't check into anything else.
[01:41:57.447 --> 01:41:58.749]  I'm telling myself working...
[01:42:00.129 --> 01:42:06.392]  I mean, lately it's been 18 hours a day the last three or four days because of being around September 11th and radio interviews.
[01:42:06.532 --> 01:42:07.533]  I can't do any more, brother.
[01:42:07.953 --> 01:42:09.154]  Well, yeah, okay.
[01:42:09.174 --> 01:42:11.135]  We'll check on that, and I'll get back to you on that.
[01:42:11.375 --> 01:42:16.538]  I know they're putting thumb scanners in, the biggest grocery store chain in Kansas.
[01:42:16.558 --> 01:42:19.019]  That was in your Kansas City Star out of Missouri.
[01:42:19.619 --> 01:42:22.701]  Yeah, well, they're going to do that over here in Pricehopper, too.
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.481]  Well, yeah, that was what it's, you know.
[01:42:24.741 --> 01:42:26.463]  That's a Northeast-based outfit.
[01:42:26.743 --> 01:42:28.044]  That's up in New York.
[01:42:28.124 --> 01:42:29.525]  It's everything, sir.
[01:42:29.705 --> 01:42:30.706]  It's everyone doing it.
[01:42:31.206 --> 01:42:32.367]  It's systematic.
[01:42:32.848 --> 01:42:33.208]  Admit it.
[01:42:33.248 --> 01:42:34.149]  We have our own documents.
[01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.529]  Plan.
[01:42:35.169 --> 01:42:35.450]  Yeah.
[01:42:35.670 --> 01:42:36.611]  They're taking over the voting.
[01:42:36.631 --> 01:42:37.571]  They're taking over the buying.
[01:42:37.591 --> 01:42:38.912]  They're taking over the tracker chips.
[01:42:39.032 --> 01:42:39.433]  Everything.
[01:42:40.053 --> 01:42:43.696]  Yeah, and I had one question, too, that a friend of mine wanted to know.
[01:42:43.736 --> 01:42:45.538]  He can't listen to you during the day.
[01:42:47.539 --> 01:42:49.301]  Whatever happened to Dick Cheney?
[01:42:49.341 --> 01:42:50.962]  You don't hear much about him anymore.
[01:42:51.202 --> 01:42:52.243]  Well, he lives in the bunker.
[01:42:53.556 --> 01:42:56.037]  He emerges every once in a while to break a tie.
[01:42:56.057 --> 01:42:58.217]  Oh, okay.
[01:42:58.297 --> 01:42:58.857]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:58.877 --> 01:42:59.457]  Good to hear from you.
[01:43:00.478 --> 01:43:00.878]  Take care.
[01:43:00.898 --> 01:43:01.818]  Clyde in Colorado.
[01:43:01.858 --> 01:43:02.578]  Clyde, go ahead.
[01:43:04.058 --> 01:43:04.678]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[01:43:05.319 --> 01:43:15.621]  I hope you will consider taking off maybe more time and letting somebody else substitute for you because I think maybe your physical and mental and spiritual health may be adversely affected.
[01:43:16.141 --> 01:43:21.382]  I know maybe you have a tendency as a young guy not to consider that, but I'm hoping and praying that that will happen in the future.
[01:43:23.686 --> 01:43:24.987]  Yeah.
[01:43:25.408 --> 01:43:25.748]  Okay.
[01:43:26.589 --> 01:43:27.009]  Well, okay.
[01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:40.622]  I wondered if you had information on or anybody could call in that would know what are the best either books, websites, or videos that show the occultic symbolism, imagery inside of both corporate deals.
[01:43:41.252 --> 01:43:44.735]  As well as all the federal, state, and local state deals, monuments.
[01:43:45.776 --> 01:43:49.379]  You know, I've thought about doing that, and that is going to happen in the future.
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.020]  Something in the works.
[01:43:51.321 --> 01:43:52.342]  In a video, you mean?
[01:43:52.682 --> 01:43:56.725]  Yeah, but we get into a lot of that actually in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:43:56.785 --> 01:43:58.367]  Yeah, I saw some of that.
[01:44:00.268 --> 01:44:02.310]  We try to give people a giant overview.
[01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:05.553]  I mean, that Police State 3, folks, is like master's degree level.
[01:44:05.573 --> 01:44:06.414]  I'm not trying to brag.
[01:44:07.094 --> 01:44:11.916]  It really gives you the fullest spectrum of info of anything in existence.
[01:44:13.237 --> 01:44:13.457]  Right.
[01:44:13.697 --> 01:44:16.118]  But, you know, it's serious stuff.
[01:44:17.038 --> 01:44:19.619]  Have you interviewed Herb Titus?
[01:44:20.319 --> 01:44:23.320]  He's one of the main attorneys for Judge Moore.
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:24.721]  Have you interviewed him?
[01:44:24.741 --> 01:44:25.821]  No, I haven't.
[01:44:27.162 --> 01:44:30.263]  There's some way I can get you his information on how to get a hold of him.
[01:44:30.303 --> 01:44:31.724]  Yeah, TimsonInfoWars.com.
[01:44:32.725 --> 01:44:33.065]  Okay.
[01:44:33.645 --> 01:44:34.646]  Okay, I'll do that then.
[01:44:34.666 --> 01:44:35.206]  I'll send it in.
[01:44:35.246 --> 01:44:35.866]  Thanks very much.
[01:44:35.966 --> 01:44:36.866]  Anything else, my friend?
[01:44:37.026 --> 01:44:37.626]  No.
[01:44:37.706 --> 01:44:38.066]  All right.
[01:44:38.166 --> 01:44:38.947]  Thank you for the call.
[01:44:39.027 --> 01:44:39.767]  Ron, you're up next.
[01:44:39.847 --> 01:44:40.587]  Others, you're up next.
[01:44:40.667 --> 01:44:43.248]  And I'll get more into the North Korea stuff.
[01:44:43.268 --> 01:44:47.709]  We covered some of the last hour and some of the other tracking system news.
[01:44:47.729 --> 01:44:50.009]  We're going to take a lot more calls.
[01:44:50.089 --> 01:44:51.410]  In fact, it's always a good idea to give the number.
[01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:52.330]  I think I'll do that now.
[01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:52.890]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:52.950]  800-259-9231.
[01:45:00.922 --> 01:45:02.042]  More news, more calls.
[01:45:02.362 --> 01:45:02.822]  Stay with us.
[01:45:03.803 --> 01:45:08.444]  Have you been tricked into believing that you can't hire or be hired without a social security number?
[01:45:08.624 --> 01:45:14.585]  You think that you can't bank, get a driver's license, or rent an apartment, or get insurance without a social security number?
[01:45:14.765 --> 01:45:17.605]  It seems everywhere you turn, somebody is asking for it.
[01:45:17.745 --> 01:45:25.127]  But did you know there is no law requiring you to obtain, have, or use a social security number to live or work in the United States?

[01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:09.915]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:46:10.075 --> 01:46:16.399]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:46:16.699 --> 01:46:25.448]  Incredibly, the low energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:46:25.688 --> 01:46:32.915]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:46:33.215 --> 01:46:33.975]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:47:03.502 --> 01:47:04.223]  We're good to go.
[01:47:04.243 --> 01:47:04.423]  I think?
[01:47:19.056 --> 01:47:20.357]  We're good to go.
[01:47:46.954 --> 01:47:47.955]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:47.975 --> 01:47:49.156]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:15.419 --> 01:48:17.280]  Often imitated, never duplicated.
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.480]  I'm just a regular guy telling it like it is.
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:20.660]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:48:22.681 --> 01:48:29.603]  I'm in this to defend my family, to defend my republic, to stand up against the most evil creatures on this planet.
[01:48:29.663 --> 01:48:31.123]  That is the globalists and their minions.
[01:48:32.363 --> 01:48:38.765]  We're about to go to Ron, Lou, Mark, Jeff, Logan, many, many others.
[01:48:40.865 --> 01:48:41.886]  I do want to get to Fez.
[01:48:41.926 --> 01:48:43.086]  North Korea missile could reach U.S.,
[01:48:45.262 --> 01:48:53.527]  Given to them by our government, that's admitted, but then you've got these shill headlines out of the disinformation agents at Fox, the ultra-left group.
[01:48:54.088 --> 01:48:54.608]  The U.S.
[01:48:54.728 --> 01:49:00.311]  official, North Korea using Russian technology for ICBM.
[01:49:00.351 --> 01:49:05.795]  Now, it's not Clinton, because I can't mention Clinton, because it was the Bush company involved in all of it.
[01:49:06.855 --> 01:49:07.976]  So we'll get into that.
[01:49:07.996 --> 01:49:10.598]  The embargo escalating things.
[01:49:11.699 --> 01:49:16.923]  Having some ships go out there, and they've released battle plans trying to get North Korea to attack us.
[01:49:17.944 --> 01:49:18.684]  It's very interesting.
[01:49:18.704 --> 01:49:19.645]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:49:20.145 --> 01:49:24.308]  Before I go back to the calls, we have open phones for us to show.
[01:49:24.328 --> 01:49:29.472]  I do want to remind you, the listeners, that I have made nine documentary films.
[01:49:29.492 --> 01:49:30.053]  They're amazing.
[01:49:30.073 --> 01:49:30.633]  They're powerful.
[01:49:30.653 --> 01:49:31.274]  They're informative.
[01:49:31.774 --> 01:49:34.136]  There's no way to describe Police State's retotal enslavement.
[01:49:34.156 --> 01:49:35.357]  There's so much information.
[01:49:35.397 --> 01:49:37.118]  It's really three films in one.
[01:49:37.702 --> 01:49:39.543]  Three 52-minute segments.
[01:49:39.923 --> 01:49:43.204]  And each section of the film covers dozens of subjects.
[01:49:43.244 --> 01:49:45.285]  I mean, it's... I can't describe it.
[01:49:45.325 --> 01:49:45.685]  You need it.
[01:49:45.725 --> 01:49:47.006]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:47.046 --> 01:49:50.087]  Watch it in three parts to fully absorb it.
[01:49:50.107 --> 01:49:53.249]  911 The Road to Tyranny is the highest production value film I've made.
[01:49:54.009 --> 01:49:55.109]  And it's people's favorite.
[01:49:55.149 --> 01:49:55.830]  It's very shocking.
[01:49:55.890 --> 01:49:57.190]  It's in the government-sponsored terror.
[01:49:57.210 --> 01:49:57.851]  September 11th.
[01:49:57.871 --> 01:49:58.431]  The Police State.
[01:49:58.451 --> 01:49:59.031]  The New World Order.
[01:49:59.051 --> 01:50:01.092]  A lot of amazing stuff.
[01:50:01.132 --> 01:50:04.193]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:06.383 --> 01:50:10.246]  Police State's Retotal Enslavement, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[01:50:10.266 --> 01:50:13.048]  There's another excellent film about 9-1-1.
[01:50:13.128 --> 01:50:13.929]  More to tell on that.
[01:50:14.489 --> 01:50:15.690]  I booked Ascent to Tyranny.
[01:50:16.471 --> 01:50:17.472]  Paul Watson's great book.
[01:50:17.492 --> 01:50:19.233]  I published Order Out of Chaos.
[01:50:20.374 --> 01:50:22.135]  It's just a great book that everybody should have.
[01:50:23.236 --> 01:50:26.999]  It's a toll-free number to order all this great stuff, folks, and support us.
[01:50:27.099 --> 01:50:28.940]  But more importantly, get stuff that will wake people up.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:29.020]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:37.072 --> 01:50:40.495]  Again, that's 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or PresentPlanet.com.

[01:50:59.714 --> 01:51:02.735]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:51:03.135 --> 01:51:04.095]  Stop doing nothing.
[01:51:04.755 --> 01:51:05.936]  Order the videos today.
[01:51:05.956 --> 01:51:08.236]  You get big discounts if you get three or more of the videos, by the way.
[01:51:08.256 --> 01:51:09.376]  888-253-3139.
[01:51:09.757 --> 01:51:14.258]  We're carrying Eric Huffschmidt's stuff.
[01:51:14.298 --> 01:51:15.958]  We're carrying Dex Mars' best stuff.
[01:51:16.558 --> 01:51:17.758]  Rich Springmeyer's best book.
[01:51:17.778 --> 01:51:24.880]  It's all there on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:26.141]  Let's go to Ron in New York.
[01:51:26.201 --> 01:51:27.081]  Ron, you've got a minute and a half.
[01:51:27.581 --> 01:51:27.881]  Hi, Alex.
[01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:34.133]  I don't want to digress from my topic that I called about, but you did mention the death of Johnny Cash and John Ritter.
[01:51:35.753 --> 01:51:49.099]  With Johnny Cash, though I'm not worshipping celebrity, but I do have to admit that the guy made music that did try to make something of a statement, you know, about what I think most human beings might be able to identify with, something about some socially decent thing.
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:50.740]  I just want to say that.
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:52.741]  Yes, he was an entertainer, but at least
[01:51:53.574 --> 01:51:54.855]  No, I like Johnny Cash.
[01:51:54.915 --> 01:52:02.701]  I'm saying, here we are talking about World War III, and I'm taking time out to talk about Johnny Cash, but I'm just making that point to show our society.
[01:52:03.061 --> 01:52:04.122]  No, I like Johnny Cash.
[01:52:04.142 --> 01:52:05.063]  You know something, Alex?
[01:52:05.503 --> 01:52:12.448]  That's the guy that represented something of the old decency, even though I know he had his problems.
[01:52:13.509 --> 01:52:16.671]  And we kind of lost a good guy there.
[01:52:16.711 --> 01:52:17.372]  That's about it.
[01:52:17.392 --> 01:52:19.053]  Hey, Waylon Jennings died.
[01:52:20.294 --> 01:52:20.854]  Waylon Jennings?
[01:52:21.435 --> 01:52:21.635]  Yeah.
[01:52:23.878 --> 01:52:25.798]  Or was it Merle Haggard?
[01:52:25.818 --> 01:52:27.219]  Somebody died just earlier this year.
[01:52:27.699 --> 01:52:29.119]  Oh, yeah, earlier, right, not today.
[01:52:29.139 --> 01:52:30.639]  Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:52:30.659 --> 01:52:32.780]  Now we've said two names of the kind of people we don't know.
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:35.520]  That's because I haven't had much sleep, but somebody will tell me.
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:36.060]  Somebody will call in.
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:38.301]  I was going to say my recollection was that a little while back.
[01:52:39.161 --> 01:52:43.021]  Hold me over after the break, and I'll get to my main thrust of my point.
[01:52:43.421 --> 01:52:47.302]  Well, that was deftly done to hold over.
[01:52:47.322 --> 01:52:48.582]  That's fine.
[01:52:48.602 --> 01:52:49.282]  You can hold over.
[01:52:49.302 --> 01:52:52.283]  When I get to all these other callers in North Korea, we'll be back.
[01:52:55.282 --> 01:52:59.825]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:53:00.125 --> 01:53:04.227]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:53:07.469 --> 01:53:10.631]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.247 --> 01:53:19.887]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.547 --> 01:53:21.588]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.308 --> 01:53:23.428]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.069 --> 01:53:24.889]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.649 --> 01:53:27.570]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:30.971]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.391 --> 01:53:35.492]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.733 --> 01:53:40.554]  Yeah, in the last segment we were talking about Johnny Cash.
[01:53:42.438 --> 01:53:43.998]  Johnny Cash dying.
[01:53:44.038 --> 01:53:49.000]  Country music legend Johnny Cash, known as the man in black, died at Nashville, Tennessee Hospital.
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:51.400]  His manager said he was 71.
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:57.002]  Johnny died due to complications from diabetes, which resulted in respiratory failure.
[01:53:57.562 --> 01:54:05.344]  Lou Robin said in a statement, I hope that friends and fans of Johnny will pray for the Cash family to find comfort during this very difficult time.
[01:54:05.404 --> 01:54:09.445]  He added the spokeswoman for Baptist Hospital said in a statement that Cash died at 2 a.m.
[01:54:11.528 --> 01:54:16.049]  And that was Central Time today, so not last night, this morning.
[01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:23.551]  Cashew became an American legend with a prodigious output of songs like I Walk the Line.
[01:54:23.571 --> 01:54:24.411]  Yeah, I like that song.
[01:54:25.011 --> 01:54:32.093]  Ring of Fire, that bore his hallmark of rugged simplicity, was released from the same hospital on Tuesday.
[01:54:32.113 --> 01:54:35.374]  He had spent three weeks there for treatment of the pancreas.
[01:54:37.413 --> 01:54:46.980]  And Robin said the first time Cash was finishing an album with songs written after his wife, fellow country singer June Carter, died in May.
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.762]  She was 73.
[01:54:49.883 --> 01:54:57.048]  Cash recently won an MTV Music Award for Best Cinematography in his hit video, Hurt.
[01:54:58.069 --> 01:55:00.971]  Again, I like Johnny Cash, so we spent some time on that there.
[01:55:00.991 --> 01:55:02.312]  And this other guy died recently.
[01:55:03.343 --> 01:55:04.264]  We're good to go.
[01:55:34.515 --> 01:55:36.497]  Go ahead, Ron, who started all of this.
[01:55:37.258 --> 01:55:38.939]  You had something else you wanted to say.
[01:55:39.139 --> 01:55:40.420]  I'll move on to my main point.
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:46.565]  I just discovered yesterday that in New York State, they have now started computer databases for hunters.
[01:55:47.486 --> 01:55:49.567]  Now, I did a little inquiry about this.
[01:55:49.587 --> 01:55:50.788]  They've already started that here.
[01:55:51.029 --> 01:55:56.753]  They quote the Stop Deadbeat Dads, and now it's going to be if you hadn't paid your taxes or your property taxes.
[01:55:56.973 --> 01:55:58.475]  See, now you can't do anything.
[01:55:58.515 --> 01:56:01.157]  It's all these making of second-class citizens.
[01:56:02.398 --> 01:56:03.799]  You know the funny part about it, Alex?
[01:56:05.209 --> 01:56:09.392]  Here in New York, we have a large illegal immigrant population, illegal alien population.
[01:56:09.852 --> 01:56:11.974]  Nobody there is put into any database.
[01:56:12.034 --> 01:56:13.195]  You can't account for anybody.
[01:56:13.255 --> 01:56:20.261]  I've watched illegals walk up and get a bank account with no identification, and then they'll ask a member of the bank for two forms.
[01:56:21.022 --> 01:56:26.766]  But a largely decent population, generally hunters in this state, tend to represent a very good law-abiding, decent population.
[01:56:26.786 --> 01:56:27.587]  They're in a database.
[01:56:27.627 --> 01:56:30.389]  Now, the funny part about it is... And that's really a gun database.
[01:56:30.509 --> 01:56:30.790]  I know.
[01:56:30.990 --> 01:56:31.670]  I understand that.
[01:56:31.710 --> 01:56:33.552]  It's a surreptitious way of doing it.
[01:56:34.481 --> 01:56:51.555]  The funny part about it is when I inquired a little further with some very responsible people, they also indicated that the hardware used to implement that program, the computer programs, the computers, the software, the whole thing, had come from that wonderful corporate paragon of virtue, WorldCom.
[01:56:53.032 --> 01:56:53.493]  We're good to go.
[01:57:13.193 --> 01:57:14.775]  On essentially oppressing you.
[01:57:14.835 --> 01:57:15.955]  I mean, we've become cows.
[01:57:16.076 --> 01:57:19.478]  They're looking at us like... Look, that's part of the matrix system, okay?
[01:57:19.498 --> 01:57:20.619]  And they call it the matrix.
[01:57:20.639 --> 01:57:21.840]  That's not from the movie, folks.
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:26.383]  The federal system with the states for echelon and total information awareness is called the matrix.
[01:57:26.403 --> 01:57:29.926]  And I just wrote my September newsletter was on that.
[01:57:30.447 --> 01:57:39.814]  And then now the newsletter, the new newsletter I've got going out is about what's happening with the law, the lawyers, getting rid of attorney-client privilege, about Schwarzenegger and a bunch of other issues.
[01:57:39.854 --> 01:57:39.954]  But
[01:57:41.041 --> 01:57:41.822]  It's just horrible.
[01:57:42.823 --> 01:57:43.965]  Funny you mention the Matrix.
[01:57:44.205 --> 01:57:46.768]  I told you I spoke to you and John last Saturday.
[01:57:46.808 --> 01:57:50.193]  As a matter of fact, I'm going to get a copy of that letter down from my federal representative.
[01:57:50.493 --> 01:57:56.942]  However, when I call my local representatives, even though it requires funding from my local legislators, they're all, like, feigning ignorance about this thing.
[01:57:57.422 --> 01:58:00.006]  And Alex, the currency, you said it was going to change in color.
[01:58:00.066 --> 01:58:03.790]  I called the bank, which I'm going to call the bank up in Buffalo.
[01:58:04.211 --> 01:58:05.332]  They denied any knowledge of it.
[01:58:05.473 --> 01:58:05.953]  Guess what?
[01:58:06.013 --> 01:58:06.554]  We now hear it.
[01:58:06.574 --> 01:58:06.934]  Guess what?
[01:58:06.974 --> 01:58:08.536]  We're going to have multicolored currency.
[01:58:08.576 --> 01:58:10.639]  I said that five, six years ago.
[01:58:10.659 --> 01:58:11.220]  It was admitted.
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:12.221]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:12.301 --> 01:58:13.523]  We'll take more calls, more news.
[01:58:15.359 --> 01:58:15.799]  We're good to go.
[01:58:43.797 --> 01:58:44.297]  We're good to go.
[01:59:13.837 --> 01:59:19.181]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:19.361 --> 01:59:23.804]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:23.945 --> 01:59:28.348]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:59:28.388 --> 01:59:29.689]  The New World Order.
[01:59:31.474 --> 01:59:35.696]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:35.776 --> 01:59:42.700]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:42.841 --> 01:59:44.882]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:45.082 --> 01:59:55.648]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:55.848 --> 01:59:58.350]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then mind you,
[01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.710]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:59:58.730 --> 01:59:59.631]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:00:14.389 --> 02:00:23.016]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:00:23.237 --> 02:00:34.506]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:00:34.726 --> 02:00:37.368]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:00:37.729 --> 02:00:41.832]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is over-filled
[02:00:42.012 --> 02:00:44.175]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:00:44.335 --> 02:00:46.197]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:00:46.397 --> 02:00:52.424]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[02:00:52.684 --> 02:00:58.330]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:00:58.670 --> 02:01:02.593]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:01:02.613 --> 02:01:03.313]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:01:03.333 --> 02:01:04.034]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:01:19.401 --> 02:01:20.021]  Big Brother.
[02:01:20.702 --> 02:01:21.762]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:22.463 --> 02:01:23.583]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:24.223 --> 02:01:25.044]  You want answers?
[02:01:25.824 --> 02:01:26.745]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:26.765 --> 02:01:31.027]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:31.547 --> 02:01:35.669]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:43.953]  All right, my friends, we have got 51 and a half minutes and two seconds left.
[02:01:44.613 --> 02:01:47.795]  As I watch my time o'clock here in this live broadcast,
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:50.963]  Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:50.983 --> 02:01:51.703]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:01:52.604 --> 02:02:00.452]  And I'm going to take a call from Lou and Mark and Jeff and Logan and whoever else that is holding there in our little loaded phone line bank.
[02:02:00.932 --> 02:02:01.753]  And that's it for calls.
[02:02:01.773 --> 02:02:07.398]  And I want to get into the North Korean news and some of the other top headlines we haven't spent enough time on yet and wrap up this show.
[02:02:07.438 --> 02:02:08.459]  But we've got a lot more coming up.
[02:02:08.519 --> 02:02:12.003]  But I've aired this about, I don't know, eight, nine times the last three or four days.
[02:02:12.183 --> 02:02:12.763]  I can't help it.
[02:02:12.884 --> 02:02:13.264]  I love it.
[02:02:15.029 --> 02:02:16.710]  Michael Corbin, who's a friend of mine.
[02:02:16.730 --> 02:02:17.770]  I've been on his show many times.
[02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:18.770]  He needs to come on this show.
[02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:19.691]  I need to get him on this show.
[02:02:19.731 --> 02:02:22.072]  I plan to have him fill in for me in the future.
[02:02:22.092 --> 02:02:26.894]  You know, if I take a day or two off of the family, which is unknown, I guess.
[02:02:28.214 --> 02:02:30.955]  But if you ever hear me take it off, it's because I'm doing something else.
[02:02:31.555 --> 02:02:33.896]  But working on something else.
[02:02:33.916 --> 02:02:35.417]  But he just does great work.
[02:02:35.437 --> 02:02:36.237]  He's a great broadcaster.
[02:02:36.257 --> 02:02:38.198]  And they make these little skits they play on the radio.
[02:02:38.278 --> 02:02:39.658]  In the past, I had time to do this.
[02:02:39.778 --> 02:02:41.279]  They weren't as funny as this, I have to admit.
[02:02:42.074 --> 02:02:43.575]  I'm a man to admit when I've been beaten.
[02:02:44.415 --> 02:02:49.337]  But this sounds like a joke, but this is really what they're crafting and building and designing.
[02:02:49.377 --> 02:02:53.698]  I mean, I have it right here in ABC News about hall monitors, spy, and Reuters.
[02:02:53.718 --> 02:02:58.440]  You know, everything's going to track you, and they can kill you for no reason under Patriot Act II.
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:02.361]  And not even ever tell anybody they grabbed you.
[02:03:03.262 --> 02:03:07.343]  And they have mobile death vans in China just like this was in the times of London.
[02:03:08.462 --> 02:03:19.564]  Showed them dragging some young woman out who was a political dissident, and they have automatic injectors that kill you, and they butcher you in the back and take your organs, sell it on the open market, and they buy them in New York and stuff.
[02:03:19.604 --> 02:03:21.584]  That's been in the Wall Street Journal.
[02:03:21.624 --> 02:03:25.845]  We had one of the doctors on about how New York, about a third of the transplants came from China.
[02:03:25.885 --> 02:03:26.925]  They're bringing the goods in.
[02:03:26.945 --> 02:03:29.006]  I mean, this is scary stuff.
[02:03:29.046 --> 02:03:35.127]  But, again, everything that's in this piece, the surveillance blimps, all of it, that's what this system's really for.
[02:03:36.158 --> 02:03:40.601]  And then the way this character goes, she keeps saying, I'm an old lady, and he's just totally ignoring her.
[02:03:40.821 --> 02:03:43.043]  That's what they do, you know, with these systems.
[02:03:44.804 --> 02:03:46.365]  So this is not really a joke.
[02:03:46.805 --> 02:03:48.546]  Here it is, Neocon Star.
[02:03:48.586 --> 02:03:49.687]  Then I'm going to write to your calls.
[02:03:49.727 --> 02:03:50.047]  Here it is.
[02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:55.311]  That's a pretty good one, isn't it?
[02:03:56.011 --> 02:03:59.393]  Again, we're test piloting today, doing some training, folks, year-long.
[02:04:00.034 --> 02:04:02.615]  Do we have Neocon Star there?
[02:04:03.256 --> 02:04:04.957]  What do we got for folks today?
[02:04:05.879 --> 02:04:15.164]  The following is an actual conversation between a Neocon Star operator and a subscriber in distress who is locked in her car and doesn't have the proper authorization to get out.
[02:04:15.664 --> 02:04:18.486]  With Neocon Star, help is just a satellite away.
[02:04:20.589 --> 02:04:23.972]  Neoconstar, how can I offer you great service today?
[02:04:24.152 --> 02:04:26.413]  Please help me, I'm trapped in my car.
[02:04:26.513 --> 02:04:28.375]  My retina scanner won't work.
[02:04:28.595 --> 02:04:29.716]  Just relax, sir.
[02:04:29.856 --> 02:04:31.557]  It's not sir, it's ma'am.
[02:04:31.677 --> 02:04:33.379]  Please hurry, it's hot in here.
[02:04:33.619 --> 02:04:38.382]  According to Admiral Poindexter's database, I have you at the Monsanto Mart on 2nd Street.
[02:04:38.522 --> 02:04:38.803]  Right.
[02:04:39.123 --> 02:04:43.506]  I have a live shot of you from the Neoconstar observation blimp in your area.
[02:04:43.626 --> 02:04:44.867]  I'm an old lady.
[02:04:45.147 --> 02:04:48.430]  Alright, sir, looks like you have no outstanding warrant, so you're not under arrest.
[02:04:49.650 --> 02:04:53.454]  Looks like you have some outstanding parking tickets in two counties.
[02:04:54.716 --> 02:04:59.622]  We'll need you to slide your national ID card for a deduction before we can release you from the car.
[02:04:59.782 --> 02:05:02.886]  Slide it through the Neocon Star console now.
[02:05:03.126 --> 02:05:04.287]  But I can't find it.
[02:05:04.327 --> 02:05:05.388]  I'm looking everywhere.
[02:05:05.449 --> 02:05:07.571]  I can't find my national ID card.
[02:05:07.791 --> 02:05:10.074]  Sir, I'm going to send a Homeland Security
[02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.629]  Okay.
[02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:24.050]  I'll take the lethal injection, please.
[02:05:25.210 --> 02:05:27.771]  I'll take the lethal injection, please.
[02:05:28.271 --> 02:05:32.772]  And then it plays through and Michael Corbin says, Does this seem far-fetched from the horizon?
[02:05:32.792 --> 02:05:34.832]  Well, this could happen if we continue to give up our liberties.
[02:05:35.472 --> 02:05:38.333]  Our freedom is the name of fighting this war on terror.
[02:05:39.773 --> 02:05:41.673]  Wow, that's just great.
[02:05:41.753 --> 02:05:44.794]  But I don't know.
[02:05:46.042 --> 02:05:47.803]  It's scary stuff that's going on.
[02:05:47.823 --> 02:05:49.724]  It's really scary stuff that's happening.
[02:05:49.984 --> 02:05:53.446]  Let's talk to Lou in Colorado.
[02:05:53.506 --> 02:05:54.306]  Lou, you're on the air.
[02:05:54.386 --> 02:05:54.707]  Go ahead.
[02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:55.467]  Good to talk to you.
[02:05:55.547 --> 02:05:55.887]  Yeah.
[02:05:55.947 --> 02:05:56.968]  Hi, Alex.
[02:05:57.068 --> 02:06:00.650]  That old lady should carry a big hammer in her car so she could break her window.
[02:06:00.690 --> 02:06:03.431]  That's all I've got to say.
[02:06:03.491 --> 02:06:04.372]  Alex, see, that's the point.
[02:06:04.672 --> 02:06:05.692]  That's very well thought out.
[02:06:05.712 --> 02:06:06.973]  She just submits.
[02:06:06.993 --> 02:06:07.153]  Okay.
[02:06:07.333 --> 02:06:07.753]  That's the...
[02:06:11.465 --> 02:06:17.008]  Funny in a way, and that's funny in a way, because I know these guys will get away with anything they can as long as people will support them.
[02:06:17.068 --> 02:06:18.709]  Hey, that's how life is in China.
[02:06:19.130 --> 02:06:20.551]  Yeah, I know that.
[02:06:20.911 --> 02:06:21.411]  I mean, I know.
[02:06:21.651 --> 02:06:27.315]  And that's what they're building to plant for the implantable microchips that the communist Chinese and IBM own.
[02:06:27.895 --> 02:06:30.837]  They really control and own Applied Digital.
[02:06:30.857 --> 02:06:32.037]  That's just a front, folks.
[02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:34.139]  People say, how do you know that?
[02:06:34.179 --> 02:06:38.281]  Well, I read their 2000 financial papers that were on ADS.com.
[02:06:39.918 --> 02:06:48.781]  I don't know if they're still up there, but I read them on air, and it said that they're owned by a debt, the debt's owned, the company's owned and controlled by IBM and the Communist Chinese military.
[02:06:49.821 --> 02:06:53.502]  Yeah, well, I'm making some pretty good headway with some of your films that I've copied, you know?
[02:06:53.982 --> 02:06:54.223]  Yes.
[02:06:54.583 --> 02:07:01.865]  And I'm really getting, you know, in the weirdest spots, I'll be out to eat somewhere, and I'll be talking with the waitress, the younger person that's interested in,
[02:07:02.338 --> 02:07:08.484]  Next thing I know, I said, I'll send them a film, and my sister-in-law said that she'd bring it over there, and the girl remembered.
[02:07:08.504 --> 02:07:10.706]  She remembered, yeah, you owe me a film on this thing.
[02:07:10.726 --> 02:07:13.349]  So there's different people that I get stuff out to.
[02:07:13.689 --> 02:07:15.351]  Yeah, folks want to know the truth.
[02:07:15.371 --> 02:07:16.372]  They want to be involved.
[02:07:16.712 --> 02:07:16.913]  Yeah.
[02:07:18.604 --> 02:07:27.618]  Anyhow, I was curious about, I remember one time you mentioned Erwin Schiff's book about how he shows that it's a private corporation, the IRS, and that the judge refused to let him sell it or something?
[02:07:27.999 --> 02:07:29.802]  Yeah, there's a lot of that now.
[02:07:29.882 --> 02:07:33.668]  They put some people in jail for websites that protest the war.
[02:07:34.897 --> 02:07:37.558]  They have banned quite a few books now.
[02:07:37.858 --> 02:07:40.659]  They're now basically burning books now, yeah.
[02:07:41.039 --> 02:07:45.101]  Is there any way to get a hold of Schiff's book in some way or form?
[02:07:45.121 --> 02:07:46.341]  That would be an interesting thing.
[02:07:46.562 --> 02:07:49.022]  Well, I mean, obviously the judge did say he couldn't sell the book.
[02:07:49.042 --> 02:07:50.983]  But he could give it away.
[02:07:51.003 --> 02:07:54.765]  It's also a great promotional item to say that because the book is out there.
[02:07:54.965 --> 02:07:55.685]  Oh, it is out there?
[02:07:55.945 --> 02:07:56.185]  Yeah.
[02:07:56.405 --> 02:07:56.666]  Oh, okay.
[02:07:56.686 --> 02:07:58.307]  You don't know the title of it off the hand, do you?
[02:07:58.367 --> 02:08:02.871]  Yeah, I got a copy of it, but like I said, I've had like six hours of sleep the last two days.
[02:08:03.352 --> 02:08:04.413]  I'm kind of brain dead right now.
[02:08:04.433 --> 02:08:11.499]  I drove back from Houston at like 12.30, got home at like 3.30, 3.45, got to bed about 4, got up about 7, so I'm kind of brain dead.
[02:08:11.779 --> 02:08:11.979]  Yeah.
[02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:12.900]  Okay.
[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:15.262]  Well, what about Mel Gibson's movie?
[02:08:15.282 --> 02:08:16.203]  How is that coming along?
[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:24.925]  Well, I talked to Mel Gibson's dad last night, and I talked to some of his other... Hutton Gibson, some of his kids were there, and some of his grandkids.
[02:08:24.945 --> 02:08:26.126]  I was like, look at Mel Gibson.
[02:08:26.887 --> 02:08:29.648]  That family all takes after the granddaddy, the great granddaddy.
[02:08:30.189 --> 02:08:36.553]  But they were all there, and Hutton said that he got a chance to watch it at Mel's house.
[02:08:39.042 --> 02:08:39.222]  Oh, okay.
[02:08:39.282 --> 02:08:39.403]  Okay.
[02:08:39.543 --> 02:08:39.883]  Right.
[02:08:40.003 --> 02:08:40.123]  Okay.
[02:08:54.204 --> 02:08:56.525]  Number one, what people have seen is not the final cut.
[02:08:56.945 --> 02:08:58.026]  We're still shooting scenes.
[02:08:58.086 --> 02:08:59.627]  We're still putting this together.
[02:08:59.847 --> 02:09:01.828]  It's not going to be out for another six, eight months.
[02:09:02.148 --> 02:09:02.408]  Oh, I see.
[02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:06.670]  And then the media took that and said, look, they said they are going to alter it.
[02:09:07.090 --> 02:09:08.191]  Totally false.
[02:09:08.251 --> 02:09:09.972]  But that's how the media twists things.
[02:09:10.092 --> 02:09:11.092]  Yeah, tell me about it.
[02:09:11.112 --> 02:09:14.634]  I've had a lot of experience with them in politics when I was in Illinois.
[02:09:16.175 --> 02:09:22.218]  You know, in your film where you show all the different things that governments do to set up people to get them into wars and so forth,
[02:09:22.745 --> 02:09:34.148]  I was watching the History Channel, and another good example of that, of what you were talking about, is they talk about this Heinrich Reinhardt, who was the Gestapo chief, and was also part Jewish, interesting enough.
[02:09:34.868 --> 02:09:39.869]  Now wait, Heinrich Himmler, or was it the Blondies?
[02:09:39.889 --> 02:09:42.629]  No, Heinrich Reinhardt was the Gestapo chief.
[02:09:43.930 --> 02:09:45.170]  He might have been a sub-chief.
[02:09:45.450 --> 02:09:49.411]  He was the cruelest of all, was also part Jewish, but was interesting.
[02:09:50.288 --> 02:10:05.787]  And following in line with your documentary on 9-1-1, is that he did a covert operation against his own German soldiers post in Poland and then planted the bodies of Polish concentration camp as if they were the attackers.
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:10.704]  And then Hitler used that as an excuse to attack Poland.
[02:10:10.985 --> 02:10:13.867]  That actually came out in Nuremberg, and that's public.
[02:10:14.068 --> 02:10:16.230]  The Nazis were good at destroying documents.
[02:10:16.810 --> 02:10:18.612]  They'd throw them into salt mines and burn them.
[02:10:18.632 --> 02:10:19.853]  I mean, they were really good at that.
[02:10:20.534 --> 02:10:27.581]  But it is a historical fact that the Nazis sent in some Gestapo, some Waffen-SS, armed SS scum,
[02:10:28.283 --> 02:10:31.044]  To kill their own German troops, a couple dozen of them.
[02:10:31.524 --> 02:10:32.744]  It was actually about a dozen.
[02:10:32.764 --> 02:10:34.205]  I don't have the exact numbers in front of me.
[02:10:34.225 --> 02:10:35.205]  I've read the news articles.
[02:10:35.705 --> 02:10:45.048]  They went in and killed around a dozen, quite a few of them, at a little radio station, a radio relay base on the Polish border, and said, yeah, the Poles have attacked us.
[02:10:46.008 --> 02:10:48.169]  But you're saying the History Channel admitted that?
[02:10:48.309 --> 02:10:53.130]  Well, yes, yes, and I thought that was just one more example to use, as well as the Pentagon Papers and...
[02:10:53.837 --> 02:10:55.478]  Now, what did the History Channel say?
[02:10:55.498 --> 02:10:59.180]  The History Channel came right out and said, yeah, he... Now, were they calling him the blonde beast?
[02:11:16.411 --> 02:11:17.412]  That I don't recall.
[02:11:17.512 --> 02:11:20.032]  Because he was the head of the Gestapo, and he got killed.
[02:11:20.052 --> 02:11:20.913]  Yeah.
[02:11:21.093 --> 02:11:23.253]  Shot in the throat by resistance fighters.
[02:11:23.273 --> 02:11:24.154]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:11:24.434 --> 02:11:27.595]  And, yeah, you're getting the last name wrong, buddy.
[02:11:27.995 --> 02:11:28.535]  Well, no.
[02:11:28.615 --> 02:11:30.176]  I'm so braindead I can't remember his name.
[02:11:30.356 --> 02:11:31.076]  Oh, that's what they said.
[02:11:31.096 --> 02:11:36.338]  I wrote it down because it also had it on the... Might have been how they were pronouncing it, but that... Reinhardt.
[02:11:36.998 --> 02:11:38.818]  R-E-I-N-H-A-R-D.
[02:11:38.838 --> 02:11:41.639]  Because they had it on print when they put it up on the screen on Satellite.
[02:11:44.116 --> 02:11:46.277]  Do you want to see what the story's about?
[02:11:46.938 --> 02:11:49.859]  They had his name on there.
[02:11:50.079 --> 02:12:10.030]  But anyhow, the main point here is, well, the point was that they did a corporate operation, again, which proves what governments will do, what people in governments will do, in order to... Well, these people that think that Romans, the book of Romans 13 and other passages says worship government no matter what, we're supposed to worship Hitler?
[02:12:11.051 --> 02:12:13.233]  I mean, you know, we're supposed to worship Stalin?
[02:12:13.253 --> 02:12:16.756]  Was Moses supposed to worship Pharaoh?
[02:12:16.996 --> 02:12:17.737]  Or communism?
[02:12:17.917 --> 02:12:20.419]  I mean, was Jesus supposed to worship Pilate?
[02:12:20.780 --> 02:12:21.020]  Yeah.
[02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:22.221]  And that's not the case.
[02:12:22.241 --> 02:12:24.023]  He said, whose symbol is on this money?
[02:12:24.623 --> 02:12:29.367]  Then, you know, yeah, if you're going to be part of their system, then, you know, give unto them what's theirs.
[02:12:29.427 --> 02:12:30.248]  That's what he was saying.
[02:12:30.588 --> 02:12:34.312]  But all Christ did was speak out against the corrupt Romans, the Gentiles,
[02:12:35.532 --> 02:12:42.797]  The corrupt religious leaders that had destroyed what Moses had been given by God.
[02:12:43.337 --> 02:12:47.380]  He was there speaking out against the government, out against the established church.
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:53.905]  And to try to say that that's not the case, well then why did almost all the disciples get their heads cut off or crucified?
[02:12:53.925 --> 02:12:55.726]  I mean, why did that happen?
[02:12:56.606 --> 02:12:58.828]  Why did the government kill them if they were worshipping the government?
[02:12:59.455 --> 02:13:00.576]  It's just not true.
[02:13:00.656 --> 02:13:01.336]  It's a fraud.
[02:13:01.376 --> 02:13:01.896]  It's a lie.
[02:13:01.936 --> 02:13:05.618]  And Hitler's favorite quote was right out of Romans, Render unto Caesar.
[02:13:06.198 --> 02:13:12.181]  So when you hear one of these devilish preachers up there know that they've got the spirit of Hitler in their hearts,
[02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:23.557]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:13:23.777 --> 02:13:35.067]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:13:35.267 --> 02:13:37.929]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[02:15:22.162 --> 02:15:24.922]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[02:15:25.363 --> 02:15:28.243]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[02:15:28.603 --> 02:15:35.744]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.

[02:17:10.952 --> 02:17:12.693]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[02:17:13.233 --> 02:17:23.539]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:17:24.139 --> 02:17:27.141]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:29.882 --> 02:17:34.144]  Oh, by the way, you know Johnny Cash died this morning at 2 a.m.
[02:17:34.305 --> 02:17:34.865]  in Tennessee?
[02:17:35.646 --> 02:17:36.686]  At the Baptist Hospital.
[02:17:38.427 --> 02:17:42.929]  And it was... Folks were asking earlier, who else died in the last year?
[02:17:42.949 --> 02:17:45.169]  And that was Waylon Jennings.
[02:17:46.130 --> 02:17:49.451]  He died on February 13th, the day before Valentine's Day.
[02:17:49.471 --> 02:17:51.352]  I'll tell you, all those guys.
[02:17:51.572 --> 02:17:53.372]  Waylon Jennings had an amazing voice.
[02:17:54.053 --> 02:17:54.853]  Too bad he's gone.
[02:17:55.213 --> 02:18:02.216]  And jumping to another subject on this issue, we were just talking during the break, the guys up in Minnesota that run the show, and
[02:18:04.325 --> 02:18:14.333]  About how people in Minnesota think that there's tumbleweeds and horses out here in Texas, and that it's all like little ghost towns and water stalls for the horses.
[02:18:15.834 --> 02:18:21.038]  And that shows how the general public can think that Bin Laden carried out September 11th.
[02:18:21.379 --> 02:18:22.900]  It's about images.
[02:18:24.161 --> 02:18:25.762]  It's about simplicity of thought.
[02:18:27.029 --> 02:18:29.750]  Because I talk to people all the time who come to Texas.
[02:18:29.810 --> 02:18:31.031]  I mean, Texas has got swamps.
[02:18:31.091 --> 02:18:31.771]  It's got mountains.
[02:18:31.791 --> 02:18:32.452]  It's got deserts.
[02:18:32.492 --> 02:18:33.072]  It's got hills.
[02:18:33.132 --> 02:18:34.292]  It's got prairies.
[02:18:34.372 --> 02:18:37.234]  It's got everything, folks.
[02:18:37.734 --> 02:18:38.294]  Everything.
[02:18:38.814 --> 02:18:45.437]  And the Westerns were all shot in Monument Valley, Utah, and South Dakota, and Arizona, and New Mexico.
[02:18:45.978 --> 02:18:47.358]  They weren't shot in Texas.
[02:18:48.018 --> 02:18:49.579]  But again, Texas, Texas.
[02:18:49.659 --> 02:18:55.522]  And you have this image of people all over the country of tumbleweeds and cactus.
[02:18:56.764 --> 02:18:57.104]  Okay?
[02:18:57.124 --> 02:18:59.866]  And you're going, what are you talking about, Alex?
[02:19:00.707 --> 02:19:01.607]  It just shows you.
[02:19:01.647 --> 02:19:05.189]  I'm trying to explain history and corruption of government and the New World Order.
[02:19:05.489 --> 02:19:12.314]  What the illusion of government is is loving and caring and public service announcements and how much they'll take care of you.
[02:19:12.334 --> 02:19:13.655]  And people buy that illusion.
[02:19:16.056 --> 02:19:17.197]  Man, people are shallow.
[02:19:17.817 --> 02:19:19.438]  It blows me away.
[02:19:20.279 --> 02:19:25.622]  And so this show is about getting outside the box, looking down on things, getting the big picture.
[02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:30.631]  Because I don't imagine I know what Minnesota's like until I've been there.
[02:19:31.051 --> 02:19:33.432]  I don't imagine I know what New York City's like until I've been there.
[02:19:33.472 --> 02:19:33.912]  I've been there.
[02:19:34.653 --> 02:19:35.833]  Or certain areas of Canada.
[02:19:36.953 --> 02:19:37.313]  I don't know.
[02:19:37.333 --> 02:19:39.814]  We've got to get our brains out of the sand, folks.
[02:19:41.055 --> 02:19:41.955]  Our heads out of the sand.
[02:19:41.995 --> 02:19:43.195]  Our brains out of the sand.
[02:19:43.235 --> 02:19:44.476]  Out of the whatever.
[02:19:45.156 --> 02:19:46.496]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[02:19:50.035 --> 02:19:52.658]  Oh, I guess Mark in Minnesota is up next, and then Logan.
[02:19:52.678 --> 02:19:53.819]  Those will be our last callers.
[02:19:53.879 --> 02:19:54.981]  We've got news I want to get to.
[02:19:55.541 --> 02:19:56.702]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:19:57.103 --> 02:19:57.523]  Hey, Alex.
[02:19:57.563 --> 02:19:58.004]  How are you doing?
[02:19:58.324 --> 02:19:58.624]  Pretty good.
[02:19:58.645 --> 02:20:01.207]  Is that not a good... You mean that's not true about Texas?
[02:20:02.028 --> 02:20:03.570]  Well, look, I'm... No, I mean... I'm kidding.
[02:20:03.870 --> 02:20:05.172]  The folks running the show know that.
[02:20:05.212 --> 02:20:06.293]  They were the ones pointing it out.
[02:20:07.057 --> 02:20:07.677]  It's just funny.
[02:20:07.717 --> 02:20:11.759]  Last night I heard some lady going, yeah, and I moved to Texas and thought it was tumbleweeds and cactus.
[02:20:12.079 --> 02:20:19.121]  But the reason I'm mentioning that is it's an example of how the illusion of media becomes the reality when it's not even true.
[02:20:19.241 --> 02:20:21.082]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:20:21.582 --> 02:20:28.484]  Actually, I wanted to point out, their propaganda, Alex, is getting so shoddy on so many levels.
[02:20:29.104 --> 02:20:30.225]  It's disgusting.
[02:20:30.265 --> 02:20:33.666]  A few weeks ago I'm watching the news, and...
[02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:36.632]  Well, they were saying how a couple more U.S.
[02:20:36.672 --> 02:20:38.615]  troops died in Afghanistan.
[02:20:39.136 --> 02:20:42.760]  They were shot by, I guess, Taliban forces.
[02:20:43.582 --> 02:20:45.023]  And, you know, that's tragic.
[02:20:45.063 --> 02:20:45.985]  That's horrible and everything.
[02:20:46.405 --> 02:20:49.910]  But I'm just wondering, you know, is this really the Taliban?
[02:20:49.930 --> 02:20:52.974]  I mean, can anybody define the Taliban or al-Qaeda?
[02:20:54.056 --> 02:20:56.758]  I'd like them to name some names.
[02:20:56.918 --> 02:20:57.898]  We can name them.
[02:20:58.398 --> 02:21:06.202]  Al Zavari and Ben Lawton are known CIA officers flown out to safety, according to MSNBC and Fox News and everybody else.
[02:21:06.262 --> 02:21:07.643]  They loaded 8,000 of them.
[02:21:07.763 --> 02:21:09.284]  The road attorney said 6,000.
[02:21:09.324 --> 02:21:09.984]  That was a year ago.
[02:21:10.044 --> 02:21:11.885]  Now it's over 8,000 reported.
[02:21:12.265 --> 02:21:13.986]  Dropped off, paid them in golden euros.
[02:21:14.386 --> 02:21:17.249]  Rumsfeld got up on TV before the war, so don't worry, it's going to be easy.
[02:21:17.669 --> 02:21:19.371]  We've paid off the Iraqi Guard.
[02:21:20.011 --> 02:21:22.734]  Two of their regular army groups have already surrendered before we attacked.
[02:21:22.994 --> 02:21:24.735]  We paid them in gold, euros, and dollars.
[02:21:25.276 --> 02:21:29.640]  Then they attack, come in, take over, and then Rumsfeld stands up, and I have this on video, sir!
[02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:31.340]  I've taped all of it.
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:33.501]  He says, we never paid anybody off.
[02:21:33.541 --> 02:21:34.902]  That's an incredible lie.
[02:21:35.122 --> 02:21:40.884]  The guy gives press conferences in front of the entire planet.
[02:21:41.344 --> 02:21:42.864]  Hundreds of cameras.
[02:21:43.224 --> 02:21:45.005]  Dozens of global networks.
[02:21:45.385 --> 02:21:47.506]  And he says we're paying them off.
[02:21:47.866 --> 02:21:49.186]  They're going to surrender.
[02:21:49.206 --> 02:21:52.227]  And then he gets up and says he never said it.
[02:21:52.327 --> 02:21:53.668]  I mean, these people...
[02:21:56.211 --> 02:21:57.112]  I'm blown away.
[02:21:57.132 --> 02:22:00.656]  I know the sad thing is people like you are looked at like the strange ones.
[02:22:01.858 --> 02:22:02.178]  I know it.
[02:22:02.979 --> 02:22:04.842]  There's no Patriot Act.
[02:22:04.882 --> 02:22:09.728]  That was a crime for him before Congress in two separate hearings to go, there's no new terror legislation.
[02:22:09.768 --> 02:22:10.329]  That's ridiculous.
[02:22:10.689 --> 02:22:12.431]  Four months after it's introduced?
[02:22:12.491 --> 02:22:12.712]  I mean...
[02:22:13.419 --> 02:22:17.501]  Folks, these lies make Bill Clinton look like pure, driven snow.
[02:22:17.921 --> 02:22:23.824]  I'm just thinking, I mean, it's like nobody can really name the exact people that they're chasing down over here.
[02:22:24.144 --> 02:22:24.564]  You know what?
[02:22:25.064 --> 02:22:28.946]  Like, to me, I mean, it's so apparent, you know, Taliban, Al-Qaeda, it's just basically...
[02:22:29.466 --> 02:22:39.313]  Reuters reported that when our special forces colonel had bin Laden and his people all in a valley, they were called off and over 100 black helicopters landed and took them out.
[02:22:40.053 --> 02:22:41.774]  Now that is Reuters, folks.
[02:22:41.895 --> 02:22:43.576]  It'll be like 50 years from now.
[02:22:43.996 --> 02:22:46.358]  We'll still be tied down in those countries.
[02:22:46.478 --> 02:22:51.321]  And we'll be watching directly into our brain plug-in, the History Channel, and they'll admit all of it.
[02:22:56.025 --> 02:22:56.906]  All right, Mark, good points.
[02:22:56.947 --> 02:22:57.167]  Thank you.
[02:22:57.187 --> 02:23:00.251]  We'll come back and take one final call, and we'll get into the news and other stuff.
[02:23:01.312 --> 02:23:02.074]  Stay with me.
[02:23:04.196 --> 02:23:05.118]  We're on the march.
[02:23:05.598 --> 02:23:07.221]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:08.122 --> 02:23:10.826]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:14.491 --> 02:23:16.113]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:16.473 --> 02:23:22.220]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:25.744]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most...
[02:23:42.806 --> 02:23:47.951]  All right, my friends.
[02:23:48.291 --> 02:23:51.434]  Let's get one final caller, then I'm going to get into this news.
[02:23:52.375 --> 02:23:53.877]  Let's talk to Logan in Texas.
[02:23:53.937 --> 02:23:54.837]  Logan, thanks for holding.
[02:23:54.877 --> 02:23:55.198]  Go ahead.
[02:23:56.028 --> 02:23:56.488]  Oh, yeah, Alex.
[02:23:56.628 --> 02:24:02.532]  I just wanted to ask you about, I've been hearing something about crop dusting in Austin for West Nile virus.
[02:24:02.552 --> 02:24:03.353]  There's something like that.
[02:24:03.373 --> 02:24:04.473]  I just didn't know if you knew anything about it.
[02:24:04.793 --> 02:24:05.954]  Yeah, they got these trucks.
[02:24:06.054 --> 02:24:11.898]  Usually you can call and say, don't drive down my street and spray me with who knows what, and now that you can't, opt out.
[02:24:12.778 --> 02:24:15.280]  And now they've got crop dusters all over spraying.
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:18.742]  And, oh, it's to stop the deadly mosquito, which is killing people and is terrible.
[02:24:19.162 --> 02:24:25.146]  The problem is, then I've got the Daily Oklahoman and all these other articles on my website where they're spraying subtilis...
[02:24:25.891 --> 02:24:27.052]  We're going to spray you forever.
[02:24:27.133 --> 02:24:27.954]  Then you have Project Shad.
[02:24:41.112 --> 02:24:41.672]  We're good to go.
[02:24:41.692 --> 02:24:41.912]  I think?
[02:25:02.242 --> 02:25:07.245]  We have a government that kills our troops, they put it in the news, and nothing's done.
[02:25:07.645 --> 02:25:08.665]  That's what's dangerous.
[02:25:08.705 --> 02:25:09.926]  So this is all part of training.
[02:25:10.486 --> 02:25:14.128]  Our daily life is just being sprayed by helicopters and crop dusters.
[02:25:14.468 --> 02:25:16.109]  Where do these crop dusters take off from?
[02:25:16.129 --> 02:25:19.250]  I just saw it on the news last week.
[02:25:19.270 --> 02:25:19.891]  I don't watch much TV.
[02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:23.833]  I saw a little blip about there being some spraying north of Austin, and they've got trucks driving around doing it.
[02:25:23.853 --> 02:25:24.873]  I saw that like a month ago.
[02:25:25.594 --> 02:25:25.994]  I don't know.
[02:25:26.014 --> 02:25:28.095]  I can't keep track of it all, man.
[02:25:28.115 --> 02:25:28.415]  They've got...
[02:25:29.838 --> 02:25:31.659]  It's a deluge of stuff.
[02:25:32.179 --> 02:25:36.441]  I'm going to try and get into that, and I'll try and get something to you.
[02:25:36.601 --> 02:25:37.882]  Yeah, folks, exactly.
[02:25:37.922 --> 02:25:38.562]  Let me know about it.
[02:25:38.582 --> 02:25:39.823]  All right, thanks a lot.
[02:25:39.843 --> 02:25:42.484]  Hey, what do you think of all the propaganda surrounding 9-1-1?
[02:25:43.084 --> 02:25:43.625]  Oh, my God.
[02:25:43.765 --> 02:25:48.087]  I stopped watching TV back in March when they started the war.
[02:25:48.207 --> 02:25:49.747]  It was just making me too mad.
[02:25:49.827 --> 02:25:54.389]  So now I go back to my parents' house every once in a while, and again, they're trying to TV, and I just get angry.
[02:25:54.410 --> 02:25:56.390]  I mean, I look at it, and it's crazy.
[02:25:56.410 --> 02:25:57.111]  9-11, it's like they say,
[02:25:58.208 --> 02:26:00.169]  They say some things, but they just don't get into it at all.
[02:26:00.209 --> 02:26:04.812]  I mean, I just end up getting mad, and I have to walk away, because I do better if I read about it or something.
[02:26:04.912 --> 02:26:06.133]  I'm the same way.
[02:26:06.153 --> 02:26:08.815]  You don't have to look at the smirking evil vampires.
[02:26:09.155 --> 02:26:12.277]  They enjoy killing America and killing innocent people.
[02:26:12.297 --> 02:26:13.758]  They show the firefighters, too.
[02:26:13.778 --> 02:26:15.158]  Oh, my God, they show the firefighters.
[02:26:15.178 --> 02:26:17.540]  Like, oh, so many lives were lost for the firefighters.
[02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:20.682]  I mean, these are the guys who, I mean...
[02:26:21.391 --> 02:26:23.052]  It's terrible what happened to the firefighters.
[02:26:23.072 --> 02:26:23.773]  Thank you for the call.
[02:26:24.053 --> 02:26:25.714]  Yeah, but how they use them, I understand.
[02:26:25.814 --> 02:26:29.897]  And how they pointed out that, oh, look, see, you've got to support the president and the firefighters.
[02:26:30.657 --> 02:26:36.861]  Folks, the government, the command bunker over in Building 7 with Giuliani and the CIA, this was admitted.
[02:26:37.382 --> 02:26:39.063]  Stay at your post.
[02:26:39.083 --> 02:26:40.143]  People had bullhorns going.
[02:26:40.544 --> 02:26:42.245]  Firefighters, get out of here!
[02:26:43.863 --> 02:26:48.186]  Private executives and people were like, you know, died in the building because they stayed in there getting people out.
[02:26:48.246 --> 02:26:49.507]  Thousands got out because of it.
[02:26:49.828 --> 02:26:55.792]  By the way, those buildings they say normally at 9 o'clock in the morning have over 20,000 people and they can hold like 40,000.
[02:26:55.912 --> 02:26:57.834]  Okay?
[02:26:58.254 --> 02:26:59.695]  So they normally hold about 20,000.
[02:27:00.096 --> 02:27:04.519]  That was the occupancy level generally for that time of day.
[02:27:04.539 --> 02:27:05.200]  Let's just admit it.
[02:27:06.301 --> 02:27:11.865]  There were 2,800 and something in and they said a couple thousand got out.
[02:27:14.913 --> 02:27:15.514]  I mean, why?
[02:27:16.115 --> 02:27:17.597]  Why were the schools all around it?
[02:27:17.777 --> 02:27:20.680]  MSNBC went to, quote, disprove the urban legend, thought it was true.
[02:27:20.901 --> 02:27:22.763]  The schools were empty around there.
[02:27:25.887 --> 02:27:29.652]  Haratz admits that the instant messaging company Odigo
[02:27:30.399 --> 02:27:30.659]  Did?
[02:27:30.999 --> 02:27:33.441]  The company says, yeah, we got some word to watch out.
[02:27:33.481 --> 02:27:36.043]  We did instant message our people and tell them to get out.
[02:27:36.103 --> 02:27:37.123]  That's not an urban legend.
[02:27:37.524 --> 02:27:39.225]  I'm not saying Israel carried the attacks out.
[02:27:39.265 --> 02:27:39.505]  No.
[02:27:40.085 --> 02:27:41.026]  Everybody knew about it.
[02:27:41.166 --> 02:27:43.647]  The French knew, the Germans, the British, the Israelis.
[02:27:43.988 --> 02:27:45.549]  They were all saying, you're about to get attacked.
[02:27:45.589 --> 02:27:48.070]  And, of course, the Globals were creating that pattern.
[02:27:48.431 --> 02:27:54.174]  Had their little CIA patsies going around, you know, leaving Korans and saying, I'm going to attack the buildings tomorrow, baby.
[02:27:54.194 --> 02:27:55.195]  Remember my name?
[02:27:55.235 --> 02:27:56.175]  Here's my card.
[02:27:56.636 --> 02:27:58.577]  Leaving all their confessions in their cars.
[02:27:58.877 --> 02:28:00.479]  Passports falling out of the skies.
[02:28:03.021 --> 02:28:04.342]  It's amazing, folks.
[02:28:04.422 --> 02:28:06.604]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[02:28:07.845 --> 02:28:21.137]  Let's go ahead and... Let's go to Jim Shepard for about five minutes, who I drug on the show this Friday about getting prepared, protecting yourselves, and then I'm going to get into the situation with North Korea and a lot more.
[02:28:22.078 --> 02:28:23.319]  Jim, thanks for coming on, my friend.
[02:28:23.479 --> 02:28:24.280]  Always a pleasure.
[02:28:24.741 --> 02:28:26.562]  You know, Alex, I was listening to your caller.
[02:28:27.582 --> 02:28:29.123]  Let me ask him to boost your audio.
[02:28:29.543 --> 02:28:29.964]  Okay.
[02:28:31.885 --> 02:28:32.585]  Go ahead, Jim.
[02:28:32.605 --> 02:28:33.305]  I can barely hear you.
[02:28:33.325 --> 02:28:33.666]  Go ahead.
[02:28:33.706 --> 02:28:34.686]  Can you hear me better now?
[02:28:34.706 --> 02:28:35.647]  I hear you good now.
[02:28:35.707 --> 02:28:36.267]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:36.287 --> 02:28:36.747]  Okay, great.
[02:28:37.408 --> 02:28:46.152]  Anyway, I was listening to your caller talk about this brain that's going on in Austin, Texas, and I just thought I would read this little notice in the paper.
[02:28:46.172 --> 02:28:47.052]  This is a legal notice.
[02:28:47.793 --> 02:28:49.834]  Notice of intent to modify weather.
[02:28:50.717 --> 02:29:15.397]  Notice is hereby given that North American Weather Consultants, Inc., 8160 South Highland Drive in Sandy, Utah, hereinafter referred to as NAWC, has or is about to file with the director of the Colorado Water Conservation Board an application for permit to conduct a weather modification program within the state of Colorado, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:29:15.557 --> 02:29:17.439]  That was actually about six months ago.
[02:29:18.470 --> 02:29:20.271]  And it just is amazing to me.
[02:29:20.431 --> 02:29:25.573]  It's just all this brain is going on, and God only knows what they're putting into the air.
[02:29:26.093 --> 02:29:33.957]  Well, Jim, the San Antonio newspaper admitted last year, remember we had those devastating floods in south and central Texas?
[02:29:34.417 --> 02:29:35.157]  Yes.
[02:29:36.978 --> 02:29:42.961]  And the government with a private firm in some classified operation didn't just have spray planes.
[02:29:42.981 --> 02:29:45.142]  They were doing something with, and this came out,
[02:29:45.737 --> 02:29:47.298]  Doing something with antenna arrays.
[02:29:47.318 --> 02:29:53.042]  Now, there's a Russian company that's owned by the Russian government, but so-called quasi-private that they've advertised.
[02:29:53.082 --> 02:29:53.762]  I've read the articles.
[02:29:54.123 --> 02:30:00.187]  Where you pay them a million bucks, they guarantee clear weather anywhere for your parade or function.
[02:30:01.067 --> 02:30:02.628]  I've read about Asian countries doing this.
[02:30:02.648 --> 02:30:03.889]  I mean, this is old.
[02:30:03.949 --> 02:30:10.574]  I mean, even the show Atmospheres on Weather Channel shows all this.
[02:30:11.371 --> 02:30:15.574]  But then the average Joe out there will go, that's ridiculous.
[02:30:15.794 --> 02:30:18.615]  Again, it's just denial.
[02:30:19.136 --> 02:30:20.897]  And on my website, I posted all the articles.
[02:30:21.237 --> 02:30:22.618]  They're spraying it said.
[02:30:23.599 --> 02:30:24.979]  Not hundreds of tons now.
[02:30:25.480 --> 02:30:34.862]  Thousands of tons of, quote, bacteria and other unnamed sources all over Oklahoma, and they say it's going to go on for a year now.
[02:30:35.342 --> 02:30:36.182]  Just kidding.
[02:30:36.382 --> 02:30:39.663]  It's spray testing in case we're bio-attacked.
[02:30:40.083 --> 02:30:40.684]  Testing?
[02:30:41.004 --> 02:30:42.064]  Thousands of tests?
[02:30:42.504 --> 02:30:43.504]  Big planes?
[02:30:43.564 --> 02:30:45.325]  I mean, again, it's just training us.
[02:30:45.385 --> 02:30:46.165]  Oh, that's the government.
[02:30:46.185 --> 02:30:46.865]  They spray us.
[02:30:46.885 --> 02:30:47.445]  Go ahead, Jim.
[02:30:48.226 --> 02:30:49.666]  Well, it's just incredible.
[02:30:49.786 --> 02:30:53.227]  And, you know, you see all this stuff happening, and I
[02:30:53.860 --> 02:30:54.520]  I had to laugh.
[02:30:54.580 --> 02:30:56.541]  I was listening to the news yesterday.
[02:30:57.521 --> 02:30:59.542]  Oh, I forget who it was talking.
[02:30:59.562 --> 02:31:03.303]  But they were talking about the Homeland Security and about the Patriot Act and all that stuff.
[02:31:03.363 --> 02:31:06.624]  And anyway, the guy being interviewed said, yeah, but we've had no abuses of this.
[02:31:07.584 --> 02:31:11.585]  And there's been no abuses of it and of these powers.
[02:31:12.525 --> 02:31:17.907]  And in the back of my mind, I was sitting there thinking, Alex, yeah, that's the plan.
[02:31:18.027 --> 02:31:18.787]  Put it out there.
[02:31:19.047 --> 02:31:20.828]  Don't abuse it for a year or two.
[02:31:20.848 --> 02:31:21.868]  Get everybody used to it.
[02:31:22.555 --> 02:31:25.977]  And then it's going to be old hat and everybody's going to say, hey, that's the law.
[02:31:26.778 --> 02:31:28.079]  And, Alex, what's next?
[02:31:28.099 --> 02:31:31.321]  Well, sir, let me tell you something.
[02:31:31.441 --> 02:31:36.064]  The Scranton Times out of Ohio and the Times-Shamrock both ran the articles.
[02:31:36.144 --> 02:31:40.007]  I know because that media company on KJFK, I worked for them years ago.
[02:31:41.245 --> 02:31:42.847]  They had a news article where they talked to U.S.
[02:31:42.887 --> 02:31:44.488]  attorneys, sheriffs, prosecutors.
[02:31:44.508 --> 02:31:48.552]  They said, oh, yeah, we catch you with marijuana, methamphetamine, anything.
[02:31:48.572 --> 02:31:51.194]  We're charging you with weapons of mass destruction.
[02:31:51.655 --> 02:31:52.315]  We've been doing it.
[02:31:52.355 --> 02:31:53.737]  We're using the Patriot Act.
[02:31:54.237 --> 02:31:58.481]  Stephen Magritte, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, reported this guy.
[02:31:58.781 --> 02:31:59.802]  They were taking his land.
[02:31:59.822 --> 02:32:01.143]  He was in a wheelchair.
[02:32:01.584 --> 02:32:03.665]  He sued public officials, and they arrested him.
[02:32:03.685 --> 02:32:05.147]  And the state's attorney said, quote,
[02:32:05.647 --> 02:32:06.948]  He sued public officials.
[02:32:07.289 --> 02:32:08.650]  That will not be tolerated.
[02:32:08.970 --> 02:32:10.431]  That is paper terrorism.
[02:32:11.332 --> 02:32:12.253]  They passed that law.
[02:32:12.773 --> 02:32:17.578]  They're trying to pass a law in Oregon where if one protester blocks traffic, all the protesters get life in prison.
[02:32:17.818 --> 02:32:19.039]  I posted that bill, folks.
[02:32:19.079 --> 02:32:19.860]  That's real.
[02:32:20.881 --> 02:32:30.329]  The head spokesman for the Justice Department in an article in the Washington Times, they were there, reported on it, told Congress that we will use this against all misdemeanors and all criminals.
[02:32:31.009 --> 02:32:32.489]  For any type of crime.
[02:32:33.270 --> 02:32:34.230]  No due process.
[02:32:35.150 --> 02:32:36.650]  So that's a lie, too, Jim.
[02:32:37.490 --> 02:32:44.252]  Well, and it looks like they're starting with some of these crimes that everybody would say, oh, well, that's really bad stuff.
[02:32:44.772 --> 02:32:46.612]  There's a bill before Congress right now.
[02:32:46.632 --> 02:32:55.334]  I was reading about this in one of the papers that a congressman from Colorado is sponsoring.
[02:32:55.914 --> 02:32:59.135]  But basically, you know, they have these groups, these green groups,
[02:33:00.450 --> 02:33:14.975]  Well, you know, most people say, yeah, well, I don't like that stuff.
[02:33:15.455 --> 02:33:25.398]  But basically what the legislation before Congress is right now is to define that kind of a crime as a terrorist crime so that they can nail them under the Terrorist Act.
[02:33:27.301 --> 02:33:27.901]  You know, Bill.
[02:33:28.041 --> 02:33:33.723]  And I tell you, you know, that's first, and probably everybody is going to say, well, you know, that's a good thing.
[02:33:34.483 --> 02:33:40.465]  But, you know, then we start getting into these little petty crimes, like what you're talking about, protesting on the streets.
[02:33:40.985 --> 02:33:46.066]  Well, look, Section 802 says any misdemeanor, any violation of federal or state law.
[02:33:46.086 --> 02:33:47.767]  So that's the past Patriot Act.
[02:33:47.887 --> 02:33:49.387]  They're implementing Patriot Act 2.
[02:33:49.767 --> 02:33:51.188]  As Ashcroft said, hey, give it to us.
[02:33:51.208 --> 02:33:51.968]  We're already implementing it.
[02:33:52.408 --> 02:33:54.689]  Jim, real quick, tell folks about the water specials.
[02:33:55.289 --> 02:33:55.629]  Okay.
[02:33:56.587 --> 02:34:01.569]  We've got this month, we've got the Berkey light without light.
[02:34:01.909 --> 02:34:12.974]  We'll also include two sport filtration bottles and two additional black Berkey filter elements so that you have a spare set of two replacement elements.
[02:34:13.034 --> 02:34:15.716]  This is a $373 retail value.
[02:34:16.096 --> 02:34:18.497]  We're going to knock $75 off the price.
[02:34:18.697 --> 02:34:19.237]  You get it for $298.
[02:34:21.872 --> 02:34:29.093]  And if folks want to see the pack, you can go to InfoWars.com, click on the Berkey water specials, and it'll take you right to the site.
[02:34:29.173 --> 02:34:33.794]  Yeah, right on the left-hand side of my website, you can click on the Berkey water specials.
[02:34:34.674 --> 02:34:40.055]  There's a picture of a Berkey light there, and you can go check it out for yourself at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:40.415 --> 02:34:41.856]  And we've got another special on there.
[02:34:41.876 --> 02:34:43.136]  You can look at that special.
[02:34:43.896 --> 02:34:47.277]  And folks get the special while it's here.
[02:34:47.317 --> 02:34:49.957]  We change these specials up, and then once they're gone, they're gone.
[02:34:50.968 --> 02:34:52.889]  Hey, Alex, you're doing a great job.
[02:34:52.909 --> 02:35:00.292]  For folks who want to take advantage of the special, you can give us a call at 888-803-4438.
[02:35:00.572 --> 02:35:03.553]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:35:04.673 --> 02:35:06.894]  And take control of your lives in a big way.
[02:35:07.594 --> 02:35:09.095]  You want to start the Fire and Snow World Order?
[02:35:09.335 --> 02:35:10.075]  We know what you can do.
[02:35:10.495 --> 02:35:13.056]  Well, you support this broadcast, of course.
[02:35:13.076 --> 02:35:14.277]  You get a great quality product.
[02:35:14.989 --> 02:35:17.995]  Well, and I think the issue is that you want to have a product that you can use every day.
[02:35:26.414 --> 02:35:32.656]  But also that will give you some independence so that you're not dependent upon... Yeah, your body is 70% water, exactly.
[02:35:32.676 --> 02:35:37.217]  And you're at the total beck and call of these psychopaths and all their useful idiots.
[02:35:37.597 --> 02:35:38.578]  So take control of your life.
[02:35:38.638 --> 02:35:43.019]  Water is life, folks.
[02:35:43.039 --> 02:35:43.479]  888-803-4438.
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:45.360]  Jim, thanks for coming on.
[02:35:45.540 --> 02:35:46.180]  Always a pleasure.
[02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:47.060]  Take care, buddy.
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:47.220]  Bye.
[02:35:47.901 --> 02:35:49.781]  All right, let me try to get into this news now.
[02:35:49.981 --> 02:35:51.062]  And, boy, there's a lot of it.
[02:35:51.082 --> 02:35:51.842]  We covered some of it.
[02:35:51.882 --> 02:35:53.742]  But North Korean missile could reach U.S.
[02:35:53.782 --> 02:35:55.063]  This is out of AP.
[02:35:57.054 --> 02:36:05.437]  North Korea has been using Russian technology and developing a new intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching any target in the continental United States.
[02:36:06.378 --> 02:36:22.104]  An administration official said Thursday, the official asking not to be identified estimated the potential range of the 9,400 miles distance from Pyongyang, Pyongyang, however you pronounce it, the North Korean capital of San Francisco was about 5,500 miles.
[02:36:22.164 --> 02:36:22.284]  So,
[02:36:24.801 --> 02:36:28.402]  They estimated the potential range of this missile at 9,400 miles.
[02:36:28.422 --> 02:36:33.644]  Well, I told you about four or five years ago the Taipong Dong-2 could hit Texas.
[02:36:35.664 --> 02:36:36.124]  Okay?
[02:36:38.025 --> 02:36:43.907]  The Taipong Dong-2 can hit Tennessee, Minnesota.
[02:36:45.287 --> 02:36:51.029]  And if they shoot it up over the pole, it can hit Illinois, it can hit New York, it can hit Florida.
[02:36:51.049 --> 02:36:52.149]  Florida.
[02:36:54.062 --> 02:37:00.025]  That's an intercontinental ballistic missile, and they got it from the loving communist Chinese.
[02:37:00.566 --> 02:37:05.288]  And they got the fuel material from Donald Rumsfeld when he headed up ABB in 1986.
[02:37:05.549 --> 02:37:18.716]  The Swiss firm, the official asking not to be in a fight, estimated the potential range of the 9,400 mile distance from the North Korean capital to San Francisco was about 5,500 miles.
[02:37:18.736 --> 02:37:19.256]  So you can tag on.
[02:37:21.698 --> 02:37:26.079]  Another 4,000 miles, roughly to that anywhere in the U.S.
[02:37:26.979 --> 02:37:29.780]  In theory, at least, a new missile could strike any target on U.S.
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:38.042]  soil, a potential that becomes all the more ominous if North Korea is able to cap the rocket with a nuclear warhead, the official said.
[02:37:38.862 --> 02:37:46.664]  There were indications that North Korea planned to exhibit the missiles as well as models of the country's existing system during national events.
[02:37:48.070 --> 02:37:50.092]  Day festivities, which they did do.
[02:37:50.172 --> 02:37:54.797]  The official said the development is significant because it demonstrates cooperation with Russia.
[02:37:56.098 --> 02:37:57.459]  Oh, yeah, Russia.
[02:37:57.699 --> 02:37:58.400]  Russia did it.
[02:37:58.420 --> 02:38:03.245]  I mean, Russia's evil, folks, as it's run by slave masters, but they're controlled by the big banks.
[02:38:04.546 --> 02:38:04.726]  U.S.
[02:38:04.806 --> 02:38:07.208]  official, North Korea using Russian technology.
[02:38:07.268 --> 02:38:11.773]  See, for the ICBM, it's Russia, not Rumsfeld, not Clinton.
[02:38:13.425 --> 02:38:15.506]  Officials in Bush administration have evidence.
[02:38:15.566 --> 02:38:16.406]  Oh, they have evidence.
[02:38:16.947 --> 02:38:21.969]  North Korea has been using Russian technology to develop a new intercontinental ballistic missile.
[02:38:22.029 --> 02:38:25.570]  Folks, we've had the evidence for five years that Pakistan's been giving it to them, too.
[02:38:26.010 --> 02:38:31.913]  Oh, our little ally, where bin Laden stays in the mountains and broadcasts threats on cue for President Bush.
[02:38:34.130 --> 02:38:36.432]  That man, Mr. Bin Laden, is about to get us.
[02:38:36.492 --> 02:38:39.634]  You had better pass Patriot Act II.
[02:38:40.515 --> 02:38:44.458]  That's what we say in Kenny Buckport, Maine.
[02:38:44.498 --> 02:38:45.799]  Watch, Bin Laden's going to be back.
[02:38:45.859 --> 02:38:46.860]  He's going to be back soon.
[02:38:46.900 --> 02:38:48.381]  An hour later, he's on TV.
[02:38:48.481 --> 02:38:49.162]  I'm going to get you.
[02:38:49.222 --> 02:38:49.842]  I'm going to get you.
[02:38:51.344 --> 02:38:55.267]  The tape services when the Powell's before Congress.
[02:38:55.407 --> 02:38:58.589]  Oh, it's airing on Al Jazeera right now, the audio tape, and he's working with Saddam.
[02:38:59.230 --> 02:39:00.731]  Sure, there's nothing on Al Jazeera.
[02:39:00.891 --> 02:39:02.272]  Oh, it'll be on soon.
[02:39:02.292 --> 02:39:02.612]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:39:05.553 --> 02:39:08.015]  Patar has always been a good friend of the CIA.
[02:39:08.755 --> 02:39:09.456]  Al Jazeera.
[02:39:11.477 --> 02:39:14.940]  And it goes on, in theory at least, the new missile could strike any target in the U.S.
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:22.825]  and it says that the Russian SSN-6 Soviet-era submarine launch missile is based on that.
[02:39:22.865 --> 02:39:33.193]  Two weeks ago, officials from North Korea and the United States, along with China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia met in Beijing to discuss ways of surmounting an impasse over the North's nuclear weapons system.
[02:39:35.879 --> 02:39:42.606]  And now they're talking about embargoes to stop them from transferring it to Iran or somebody, and a blockade, nice escalation.
[02:39:42.647 --> 02:39:48.833]  And Rumsfeld has released three separate battle plans about his plans to attack his business partners.
[02:39:49.594 --> 02:39:51.777]  They said earlier this year by October.
[02:39:53.659 --> 02:39:54.840]  That's next month.
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:57.501]  They released a plan and said, oh, it's classified.
[02:39:57.521 --> 02:39:58.021]  How did it get out?
[02:39:58.061 --> 02:39:58.601]  Oh, it's terrible.
[02:39:58.882 --> 02:40:04.104]  Complete with how they were going to hit their bunkers with bunker buster and many nukes and how they were going to send in the forces.
[02:40:04.124 --> 02:40:07.786]  And they pulled back our troops from the border and moved up the artillery.
[02:40:12.028 --> 02:40:13.829]  Trying to get the psychopath to move.
[02:40:13.869 --> 02:40:15.189]  Trying to get the froggy to jump.
[02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:17.571]  And now they've got the national draft lined up.
[02:40:18.031 --> 02:40:20.372]  Imagine the heroes we'll have, our new wartime leader.
[02:40:21.443 --> 02:40:27.667]  I mean, it's like watching a TV ad for Kim Jong-il, the stuff on September 11th with Bush, our dear leader, how he stood up bravely.
[02:40:27.687 --> 02:40:30.589]  It's like watching Hitlerian newsreels.
[02:40:30.969 --> 02:40:33.831]  The globalists out of World War III, a limited exchange.
[02:40:34.571 --> 02:40:36.552]  Imagine the police state they'll get out of that.
[02:40:36.612 --> 02:40:39.754]  Well, I don't want to turn my guns in, but you know, terrorists have got them.
[02:40:39.774 --> 02:40:40.915]  We've all got to do our part.
[02:40:42.016 --> 02:40:50.201]  Well, I didn't want to wear an RFID tag around my neck with my ID, but to go out, be able to go out and not be messed with, molested by the government, I better do it.
[02:40:51.283 --> 02:40:54.204]  You know, we all got to do our part after the nuke hit.
[02:40:54.984 --> 02:40:56.004]  After the nuke hit.
[02:40:56.104 --> 02:41:05.907]  Luckily, it went off course and hit up there in Utah, or hit up there in Oregon.
[02:41:07.687 --> 02:41:15.109]  Missile wobble off course hit a populated area, but it did kill thousands, and radiation's everywhere, and we're going to war!
[02:41:18.032 --> 02:41:21.534]  And I'm glad Bush is moving to arrest all the people that criticized him.
[02:41:21.554 --> 02:41:22.835]  We've got to get tough.
[02:41:22.935 --> 02:41:26.197]  We're under nuclear, nuclear attack.
[02:41:27.318 --> 02:41:29.980]  Boy, I tell you, we just had to do it.
[02:41:30.460 --> 02:41:34.863]  I just had to turn my guns in.
[02:41:36.824 --> 02:41:39.686]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:41:40.427 --> 02:41:41.708]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:42:01.843 --> 02:42:06.487]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:42:06.587 --> 02:42:12.833]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:42:12.873 --> 02:42:14.695]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:42:32.916 --> 02:42:34.979]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.

[02:43:35.530 --> 02:43:38.872]  If you're like most Americans, you've heard how low interest rates are these days.
[02:43:38.952 --> 02:43:41.054]  So why are you still struggling to pay off debt?
[02:43:41.374 --> 02:43:43.896]  Rates on debt consolidation loans are at all-time lows.

[02:43:49.219 --> 02:43:51.060]  And no one makes it easier than the credit people.
[02:43:51.180 --> 02:43:57.284]  The credit people offers homeowners consolidation loans that lower their monthly payments, making it possible to get out of debt quickly and easily.
[02:43:57.404 --> 02:43:58.505]  Fixed rates start as low as 5.25%.
[02:44:00.146 --> 02:44:00.846]  We're good to go.
[02:44:15.435 --> 02:44:15.595]  Call now!

[02:44:41.019 --> 02:44:42.940]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:44:43.421 --> 02:44:46.223]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:48.124 --> 02:44:55.730]  There's been massive psychological preparing of the ground for the suitcase nuke, the dirty bomb.
[02:44:56.130 --> 02:44:57.211]  Both Korea to attack us.
[02:44:57.251 --> 02:45:01.053]  And I don't doubt that psychopathic demon, that hereditary leader.
[02:45:01.554 --> 02:45:06.237]  It's always a bad sign when your leaders are the sons of the leader before them.
[02:45:06.998 --> 02:45:08.759]  Like they have in North Korea.
[02:45:10.131 --> 02:45:11.451]  In other places.
[02:45:13.192 --> 02:45:16.533]  But pushing them, after arming them, pushing them into it.
[02:45:16.553 --> 02:45:18.133]  We're going to have blockades.
[02:45:18.473 --> 02:45:19.494]  We're going to get you.
[02:45:19.514 --> 02:45:21.074]  Of course, they gave him the weapons.
[02:45:21.514 --> 02:45:22.775]  But hey, Moscow Times.
[02:45:22.975 --> 02:45:26.056]  Big Bush's visit fuels talk of big deals.
[02:45:27.436 --> 02:45:32.237]  He may be retired from public life, but George Bush seems to cause a stir every time he comes to Russia.
[02:45:32.557 --> 02:45:36.899]  Well, yeah, former CIA chief meeting with the former H-E-B section chief.
[02:45:36.959 --> 02:45:38.259]  It's a great and great day together.
[02:45:39.241 --> 02:45:40.361]  He may be retired.
[02:45:40.421 --> 02:45:40.721]  Oh, yeah.
[02:45:40.781 --> 02:45:41.341]  You name it.
[02:45:41.762 --> 02:45:47.683]  And market players were buzzing Thursday about the real reasons behind the former American leader's visit.
[02:45:47.763 --> 02:45:49.763]  An $18 billion play of the U.S.
[02:45:49.843 --> 02:45:57.005]  oil giant Chevron Texaco for a blocking stake in the new Yacos-Sib-Nef combo.
[02:45:57.745 --> 02:46:05.927]  The launch of a $500 million private tie-up between Alpha Group and the Pentagon-connected Carlyle Group.
[02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:10.393]  Divvying up the hydrocarbon resources of post-war Iraq.
[02:46:10.413 --> 02:46:17.339]  And it goes all into his meetings with all the... Well, there's only six heads of all the industries now.
[02:46:17.419 --> 02:46:18.560]  They don't have communism.
[02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:27.787]  They have, you know, just where there's kings over each sector and there's more crime, more slaughter, and the old bread lines and prostitution is the only job your daughter can get.
[02:46:28.348 --> 02:46:29.589]  It's just command and control.
[02:46:29.649 --> 02:46:30.870]  Just take down the Red Stars.
[02:46:30.930 --> 02:46:32.531]  Well, they put the Red Stars back.
[02:46:34.230 --> 02:46:38.592]  And so the CIA operative flew in and met with his counterparts.
[02:46:38.892 --> 02:46:44.175]  Of course, they hired General Primakov to help run Homeland Security, according to the Associated Press.
[02:46:44.695 --> 02:46:47.416]  Yeah, former KGB chief helping out.
[02:46:49.037 --> 02:46:51.778]  Again, that's a conservative move, of course.
[02:46:53.879 --> 02:46:56.240]  Very, very conservative.
[02:46:59.045 --> 02:47:02.628]  And it says, Washington Court's limits use of GPS.
[02:47:02.648 --> 02:47:06.551]  Police cannot attach a global positioning system tracker to a suspect's vehicle without a warrant.
[02:47:06.591 --> 02:47:07.171]  Hey, that's good.
[02:47:07.191 --> 02:47:11.174]  The Washington Supreme Court declared Thursday the first such ruling in the nation.
[02:47:11.194 --> 02:47:19.740]  The court, however, refused to overturn a murder conviction of William Bradley Jackson, who was unknowingly led police to the shallow grave of his 9-year-old daughter, 99.
[02:47:20.020 --> 02:47:24.704]  Now, I'm glad they caught this guy, but they could have gone and gotten a warrant to do it.
[02:47:25.709 --> 02:47:29.110]  I understand they acted like they knew where it was at and manipulated him into doing it.
[02:47:30.350 --> 02:47:32.471]  And, you know, I'm glad they caught him.
[02:47:32.711 --> 02:47:35.552]  But that's how you turn to the devil fighting the devil.
[02:47:35.572 --> 02:47:37.072]  You think, well, I'll just do it this time.
[02:47:37.532 --> 02:47:38.833]  But then see, it's for everybody.
[02:47:39.073 --> 02:47:41.733]  And then corrupt cops are allowed and corrupt governments are allowed to do that.
[02:47:41.994 --> 02:47:48.135]  You see, you centralize power, you take out the checks and balances, and the bad people get into control and they can abuse everybody.
[02:47:49.296 --> 02:47:50.576]  It's an interesting article there.
[02:47:52.786 --> 02:47:53.827]  Oh, boy, it goes on and on.
[02:47:53.847 --> 02:48:03.870]  A lot of folks are fighting back against Monsanto overseas, tearing apart their company headquarters, because Monsanto is really launching a biological attack.
[02:48:03.890 --> 02:48:06.391]  They're taking over the genome of plant species.
[02:48:06.852 --> 02:48:12.534]  They're patenting life where these life forms don't produce seeds that produce the plant.
[02:48:12.614 --> 02:48:15.715]  Again, they're killing the life cycle for a monopoly.
