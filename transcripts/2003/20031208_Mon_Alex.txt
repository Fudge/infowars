[00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:06.115]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.796 --> 00:00:07.836]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:09.677]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.318 --> 00:00:11.138]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:12.799]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.162]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:21.704]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.141]  All right, folks.
[00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:44.322]  It's already another Monday, a big fat week spanning out before us.
[00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:45.723]  It is the 8th of December, 2003.
[00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:50.624]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:53.925]  We've got George doing a great job riding shotgun with us.
[00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:58.626]  We'll be here for the next three hours with a ton of vital news and riveting news.
[00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:12.187]  Very important information, and I want to have wide-open phones today, whether you agree with me, agree with me, disagree with me, hate me, questions, comments, news items I'm not covering that you think are important.
[00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:19.171]  We're going to have wide-open phones on this 8th of December, 2003, Monday edition, throughout the broadcast.
[00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:21.453]  Toll-free number to join us on air.
[00:01:21.613 --> 00:01:24.815]  Any issue you want to discuss, wide-open phones at 1-800-259-9292.
[00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.439]  31.
[00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:30.439]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.742]  Coming up, Bush presides over biggest growth in U.S.
[00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:33.783]  spending since 1990.
[00:01:44.153 --> 00:01:44.333]  I think.
[00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:44.493]  I think.
[00:02:00.388 --> 00:02:13.738]  Over the weekend, gold had hit $408, or almost $408, $407 and something like 50-something cents, and it looks like it's going to continue to go upwards.
[00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:14.658]  This is amazing.
[00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:25.446]  I heard the experts that I trust predict this for the end of this year, and it's happening right on schedule, or as the Europeans say, scheduled.
[00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:27.063]  Very, very serious.
[00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:32.346]  Global warming could submerge three large Indian cities in the subcontinent.
[00:02:32.406 --> 00:02:34.867]  More propaganda from the globalists.
[00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:36.127]  This out of AFP.
[00:02:36.748 --> 00:02:45.812]  Also, last week, the Supreme Court threw out the Silvera case, which was standing up for the Second Amendment.
[00:02:45.892 --> 00:02:50.394]  They affirmed the appeals court that said there is no Second Amendment.
[00:02:50.494 --> 00:02:52.535]  All guns can be banned and confiscated.
[00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:55.016]  The Supreme Court agrees.
[00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:59.672]  Now remember, the vast majority of them appointed by Republicans.
[00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:02.372]  Of course, the Democrats are voting against the guns as well.
[00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:10.134]  But we have our neocon court against the guns, against the Fourth Amendment, against the Second Amendment, against everything.
[00:03:10.174 --> 00:03:11.195]  We'll be going over that.
[00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:13.215]  And a whole stack of news here.
[00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:17.296]  Every day I probably see, I don't know, 15, 20 of these articles, and I'm not even looking for them.
[00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:20.737]  Pharmacy manager shoots would-be robbers.
[00:03:21.237 --> 00:03:23.838]  Woman slashed to death in sword attacks.
[00:03:23.858 --> 00:03:25.198]  You've got to ban those swords.
[00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.796]  Home entry, not random, sheriff says.
[00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:30.518]  Woman attacked by criminal, she takes him out.
[00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.902]  Cape man defends shooting of neighbor's pet bull that was attacking him.
[00:03:35.602 --> 00:03:37.464]  These articles, I see them all the time.
[00:03:38.845 --> 00:03:42.888]  Also a story of a man defending himself and being grabbed by the police.
[00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.013]  We'll talk about the travesty of justice, the plight of Melvin Spalding.
[00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.700]  Tough new tactics by U.S.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.200]  Titan grip on Iraq towns.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.082]  They're turning entire towns, according to the New York Times, into concentration camps.
[00:03:59.202 --> 00:04:01.583]  The New York Times says this is a great idea.
[00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:04.064]  They're, of course, all for it, spinning it.
[00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.089]  We'll get into that report.
[00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.634]  Also, Newt Gingrich says that we've driven off a cliff in Iraq and are going to fail, basically.
[00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:13.496]  That out of Time Magazine.
[00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:16.498]  This is one of the guys, of course, who was for the war.
[00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:17.599]  Newsweek.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:25.165]  Gingrich speaks out against administration's policy in Iraq, so Time and Newsweek are reporting on that, saying the U.S.
[00:04:25.526 --> 00:04:26.687]  went off a cliff.
[00:04:28.248 --> 00:04:29.609]  Folks, that's just some of it.
[00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.732]  We'll get into some of the new layoffs and the real economic numbers.
[00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:38.099]  After this quick break, that's only the tip of the iceberg of what we'll be covering.
[00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.321]  New developments in the Mexican troops kidnapping Texas family.
[00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:44.942]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:45.082 --> 00:04:45.943]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:53.466]  The websites are prisonplanet.com, updated freshly this morning for you, and infowars.com.
[00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:57.248]  We'll be back with the details on the news, your calls, and a lot more.
[00:04:57.348 --> 00:04:57.868]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:05.212]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.412 --> 00:05:09.817]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:14.341]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.723]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.443 --> 00:05:16.844]  Can emerge.
[00:05:17.524 --> 00:05:21.749]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:28.736]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:30.858]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:41.585]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:41.865 --> 00:05:47.226]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:50.367]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:50.487 --> 00:05:51.067]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.127 --> 00:05:51.507]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.527 --> 00:05:52.808]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:06.616]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:11.080]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[00:06:11.581 --> 00:06:18.788]  Only recently has science discovered that maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[00:06:19.328 --> 00:06:36.394]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels, increased libido, which helps prevent impotence, relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort, helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:39.615]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[00:06:40.095 --> 00:06:48.325]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:50.207]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings.
[00:06:50.267 --> 00:06:52.189]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[00:07:00.202 --> 00:07:01.823]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.184 --> 00:07:07.928]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:08.168 --> 00:07:13.312]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:13.653 --> 00:07:22.940]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.241]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:07:28.561 --> 00:07:32.582]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:07:32.762 --> 00:07:37.563]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:07:37.904 --> 00:07:43.805]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:07:44.145 --> 00:07:53.188]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:56.489]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.549]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:08.292]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.912 --> 00:08:11.873]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.204 --> 00:08:24.228]  The dollar has been dropping every day for the last week.
[00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.512]  Gold is rising in accordance with that.
[00:08:29.493 --> 00:08:36.959]  And shocking a lot of establishment economists, gold is skyrocketing while the stock market has been going up.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:46.287]  But simply put, that's because the dollar has been massively devalued, so it's going to take more of those dollars to buy stocks.
[00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:51.841]  And the dollar has dropped a lot more than the stocks have gone up.
[00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:53.122]  Stocks go up by 6%.
[00:08:53.842 --> 00:08:56.384]  The dollar drops by 30-plus percent.
[00:08:57.024 --> 00:08:57.985]  I've been saying 32%, 33%.
[00:08:58.125 --> 00:09:00.987]  I actually saw some of the numbers going back over two years.
[00:09:01.448 --> 00:09:03.029]  It's dropped 43% against the euro.
[00:09:05.439 --> 00:09:18.652]  I've been going off numbers over the last year and a half, but if you go back over two years, the euro was about 80 cents to the dollar and has now risen to about $1.22, $1.23 against the dollar.
[00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:22.335]  And so that's a 40-plus percent drop in the dollar.
[00:09:22.636 --> 00:09:26.920]  The dollar has been the world reserve currency since the end of 1945.
[00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:36.418]  Since the end of World War II, going into 1946, it became the world reserve currency.
[00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:37.648]  We're good to go.
[00:09:37.728 --> 00:09:37.968]  I think?
[00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:09.952]  And so you may not care about economics.
[00:10:09.993 --> 00:10:12.014]  You may not care about the dollar.
[00:10:12.054 --> 00:10:13.656]  But this is affecting you.
[00:10:14.036 --> 00:10:15.517]  It's affecting every single one of us.
[00:10:15.937 --> 00:10:17.659]  And more details of that are coming up.
[00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:23.023]  Also, we're going to have open phones here on the show on this 8th of December edition on this Monday.
[00:10:23.063 --> 00:10:25.245]  And I know we've got folks already holding, Emmett and others.
[00:10:25.705 --> 00:10:28.588]  The toll-free number to join me on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:36.915]  If you want to talk about the dollar or the economy or the layoffs or the war...
[00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.592]  I want to talk about the police state.
[00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:41.694]  I want to talk about the Patriot Act, the Second Amendment.
[00:10:42.435 --> 00:10:51.726]  But an issue that we need to spend a lot of time on this week is what the Supreme Court did last week that I just became aware of last Thursday.
[00:10:52.566 --> 00:11:06.800]  And over the weekend, I had some time to read over the Supreme Court ruling on the Second Amendment, and they have seconded the appeals court ruling and put it back to the appeals court and said no need to re-rule on this.
[00:11:07.581 --> 00:11:13.327]  We believe there is no Second Amendment, that all guns can be registered, banned, or confiscated.
[00:11:13.367 --> 00:11:14.768]  That's what the ruling says.
[00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:16.230]  I have it here in front of me.
[00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:26.181]  And simultaneously, they have the neocon reporters in the major gun publications saying, hey, registration isn't a restriction.
[00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:28.322]  Banning some guns isn't a problem.
[00:11:28.742 --> 00:11:30.062]  Don't be an extremist.
[00:11:30.722 --> 00:11:32.283]  Go ahead and go along with this.
[00:11:32.783 --> 00:11:44.186]  And a few months ago in federal court in D.C., the NRA lawyer said that they're all for registering all guns and not letting you leave your home without...
[00:11:45.346 --> 00:11:46.387]  Well, not even with a permit.
[00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:48.429]  That guns should not leave the home was the quote.
[00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:58.857]  And the Cato Institute and others have gone public about their lawsuits for the Second Amendment being covertly blocked by the National Rifle Association.
[00:11:59.978 --> 00:12:01.439]  Trojan horses, folks.
[00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:02.540]  Benedict Arnold.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.320]  Traitors.
[00:12:04.261 --> 00:12:06.083]  We would get our Second Amendment back.
[00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:07.444]  We would repeal laws.
[00:12:07.744 --> 00:12:08.885]  We have the power.
[00:12:08.925 --> 00:12:10.366]  The biggest lobby in the country.
[00:12:11.067 --> 00:12:15.631]  Much bigger than even seniors is the 100-plus million gun owners.
[00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:17.512]  But we can't get them moving.
[00:12:17.872 --> 00:12:21.195]  We can't get them to stand up and resist this tyranny.
[00:12:21.335 --> 00:12:24.037]  There's about 125 million gun owners, roughly.
[00:12:24.057 --> 00:12:27.640]  A little under half the population own guns.
[00:12:29.061 --> 00:12:33.745]  But we can't get them moving because they all think the NRA is there protecting them, and we're losing everything.
[00:12:34.477 --> 00:12:37.559]  So here's reflections upon the U.S.
[00:12:37.599 --> 00:12:48.845]  Supreme Court's rejection of the Silvera case that was brought by the Second Amendment Foundation and Mr. Silvera against Lockyer.
[00:12:50.006 --> 00:12:50.426]  When the U.S.
[00:12:50.466 --> 00:12:59.031]  Supreme Court denied a hearing in the Silvera v. Lockyer Second Amendment lawsuit Monday, responses in the gun rights community ranged from happy and...
[00:13:00.278 --> 00:13:19.869]  Relieved to disillusioned and angry, see, having co-invested thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars in the case with the amazing help of many individual American people who, like me, wanted to give the system another chance to redeem itself, I find myself in the outraged, disheartened, and disgusted camp.
[00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.492]  This is Angel Shamaya of Keaton Bear Irons being attacked by the neocon gun groups.
[00:13:25.813 --> 00:13:28.094]  They had a big fund drive to fund this lawsuit.
[00:13:29.156 --> 00:13:33.795]  And it was a good lawsuit on the basis of the Second Amendment, not some little side tertiary issue.
[00:13:35.306 --> 00:13:41.288]  And a lot of the neocons, I have a stack of the articles here today in the Big Gun Group website, are saying, oh, this is good.
[00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:47.430]  We didn't want to have a Supreme Court case because the Supreme Court would rule against it, and we don't want to have that.
[00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:54.512]  Let's just leave it at the appeals court level, at the circuit court level, and we'll just allow that to take place.
[00:13:55.353 --> 00:14:02.255]  Well, now the states and all over the place have got laws to go ahead and start banning guns wholesale, Illinois, Ohio, you name it.
[00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:04.736]  And they're going to use this ruling.
[00:14:04.776 --> 00:14:05.717]  So it stops there.
[00:14:05.997 --> 00:14:12.022]  The Supreme Court agreed with the ruling, said they wouldn't hear it, didn't send it back to the court, just said we agree with the ruling.
[00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:18.366]  And the circuit court ruled, you may remember earlier this year, that there is no Second Amendment.
[00:14:18.486 --> 00:14:19.607]  All guns can be banned.
[00:14:19.968 --> 00:14:21.769]  All guns can be registered or confiscated.
[00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:30.782]  California Attorney Peter Mankus is also displeased, and he's chosen to share his reflections upon the U.S.
[00:14:30.802 --> 00:14:33.907]  Supreme Court rejection of Silvera below his candor.
[00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:55.994]  And authenticity, accuracy, and lucidity in his message were surely to strike a nerve, especially among those who are more concerned about being liked, about being nice, and about not wanting to appear extreme than they are about being honest and forthright and courageous in their use of what's left of our freedom of speech.
[00:14:56.094 --> 00:15:01.995]  Like Patrick Henry, Mr. Mankus, we're going to get him on the show this week, does not concern himself with such nonsense as
[00:15:03.296 --> 00:15:04.577]  Tyranny with manners.
[00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:12.164]  Mr. Mankus talks straight and speaks the unspeakable with the directness sadly absent in upper echelons of the gun rights movement.
[00:15:12.504 --> 00:15:15.707]  Thus, the below will get him painted as a...
[00:15:16.852 --> 00:15:25.156]  Heroin by some and as dangerous by others, further revealing the widening chasm between shooters and patriots.
[00:15:25.516 --> 00:15:29.798]  In other words, Peter Mankus is a leader, and his message below is good stuff.
[00:15:30.218 --> 00:15:36.621]  After reading the statement of his, hopefully people will revisit his Liberty piece, too.
[00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:37.421]  There's a link to that.
[00:15:37.721 --> 00:15:40.503]  We're going to post this on prisonplanet.com.
[00:15:40.563 --> 00:15:44.725]  It's at keepingbarearms.com forward slash Mankus forward slash sylvera.asp.
[00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:52.944]  Now, it's 38 pages long from there, and I can't read all of it, but I'm going to read some of it.
[00:15:53.065 --> 00:15:57.989]  But to boil it down, still Angel Shamaya doesn't get the full horror of it.
[00:15:59.831 --> 00:16:05.236]  He's saying, man, what is it about the NRA saying they want to register all the guns and not let you leave your home with them?
[00:16:05.896 --> 00:16:06.617]  We're good to go.
[00:16:06.637 --> 00:16:07.117]  We're good to go.
[00:16:27.685 --> 00:16:30.807]  To ban people under 21 from touching a handgun.
[00:16:31.327 --> 00:16:32.988]  Under 18 from touching a rifle.
[00:16:33.008 --> 00:16:35.730]  It would ban Junior Olympics and some Olympic shooters in Texas.
[00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:37.931]  They had bills to shut down the gun shows.
[00:16:38.311 --> 00:16:39.852]  They had bills to do everything.
[00:16:40.692 --> 00:16:42.373]  And this was four years ago.
[00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:43.614]  Two sessions ago.
[00:16:43.954 --> 00:16:46.476]  And remember I went in and got the video of the bribery going on.
[00:16:46.516 --> 00:16:49.397]  It made headlines all over the state and some national papers.
[00:16:49.437 --> 00:16:51.558]  And the video was posted all over the internet.
[00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:54.580]  By the grace of God, we caught this going on.
[00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:55.461]  But...
[00:16:56.625 --> 00:16:58.286]  I was attacked by the NRA.
[00:16:59.006 --> 00:17:02.408]  That is Peaceful Texas for Firearms rights in the Dallas Morning News.
[00:17:02.428 --> 00:17:06.911]  They called us extreme and talked nice about the gun control groups.
[00:17:08.452 --> 00:17:10.353]  And the NRA wouldn't come to our rallies.
[00:17:10.393 --> 00:17:13.195]  We've had congressmen and senators at rallies before.
[00:17:14.395 --> 00:17:15.856]  You know, a lot of prominent people.
[00:17:16.296 --> 00:17:17.657]  JPFO's been there.
[00:17:17.737 --> 00:17:18.918]  Gun Owners of America's been there.
[00:17:19.198 --> 00:17:20.439]  But NRA wouldn't come.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.140]  We've seen them all over the country.
[00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:25.602]  Tell people to compromise.
[00:17:26.351 --> 00:17:30.254]  Well, compromise is if they gave up a foot and we gave up a foot, we'd be in the same spot.
[00:17:31.414 --> 00:17:33.276]  The globalists never give up an inch.
[00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:37.999]  We're just pushed more and more towards the edge of that cliff, and there's not much further to fall.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.763]  And, wow, it's amazing.
[00:17:45.584 --> 00:17:56.151]  It's amazing to see this case, to have the Supreme Court not hear it, and say that the San Francisco court,
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.462]  So, ruling stands for the entire country.
[00:17:59.502 --> 00:18:08.629]  By the Supreme Court doing that, that's now a national precedent with that federal court, one of the highest courts in the land, and the Supreme Court says, yeah, we agree with it, we're not going to hear it.
[00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:18.057]  And again, seven of the members, almost two-thirds, well, the vast majority, more than of the Supreme Court,
[00:18:18.952 --> 00:18:21.033]  We're put there by Republicans.
[00:18:21.093 --> 00:18:25.895]  And I hear all this stuff, we better vote for Bush so he'll appoint good members to the Supreme Court.
[00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:29.076]  And all these dastardly Democrats, they block our nominees.
[00:18:30.996 --> 00:18:32.497]  It doesn't matter, folks.
[00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:37.599]  Bush says he's going to sign the assault weapons ban next year.
[00:18:38.739 --> 00:18:40.680]  Only about six months away.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.880]  Less than six months now.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.861]  What is it, four months?
[00:18:44.676 --> 00:19:00.622]  They're going to reauthorize the assault weapons ban, and the bill he says he will sign, according to the Associated Press, bans another 60-something type of rifles, dozens of types of shotguns, dozens of different types of handguns.
[00:19:00.642 --> 00:19:05.364]  Depending on the interpretation, it's above 100 different types of weapons.
[00:19:07.164 --> 00:19:08.865]  Folks, this is amazing!
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.984]  And the average neocon listening to Savage or Limbaugh or Hannity will never know about this.
[00:19:15.704 --> 00:19:16.825]  They have no idea.
[00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:20.427]  When it does happen, well, I guess Bush had to compromise.
[00:19:20.447 --> 00:19:23.609]  That's what the NRA magazine tells me to do.
[00:19:23.769 --> 00:19:31.254]  How good Ashcroft is is he quadruples the funding for the BATF and builds a giant building in Washington, one of the biggest buildings in D.C.
[00:19:31.294 --> 00:19:38.859]  now, under construction, almost done, a gigantic, gigantic complex in Washington.
[00:19:40.063 --> 00:19:48.967]  And they've got the Strengthening the Knicks program funding, Republican-sponsored, that Bush says he'll sign, that turns the Total Information Awareness Network loose on gun owners.
[00:19:50.268 --> 00:19:52.609]  You realize how big this is, folks?
[00:19:53.629 --> 00:19:55.010]  Now, who are the traitors here?
[00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.090]  1-800-259-9231.

[00:21:51.112 --> 00:21:55.014]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[00:21:55.254 --> 00:21:57.055]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[00:22:10.478 --> 00:22:13.339]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[00:22:13.719 --> 00:22:20.840]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.240]  That's recovery?
[00:22:22.861 --> 00:22:28.062]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[00:22:28.462 --> 00:22:30.042]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?

[00:23:55.805 --> 00:23:56.045]  P.O.
[00:23:56.085 --> 00:23:58.326]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[00:23:58.586 --> 00:24:14.151]  The Republican Party controls the House, the Senate.
[00:24:15.572 --> 00:24:16.912]  That's the legislative, folks.
[00:24:17.272 --> 00:24:18.773]  The executive, the presidency.
[00:24:19.739 --> 00:24:27.126]  Most of the governorships of the states, they also control the judicial, the vast majority.
[00:24:28.407 --> 00:24:33.331]  And all of this gun control, all of this evil taking place right now.
[00:24:33.752 --> 00:24:36.354]  And again, the average conservative has no idea.
[00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:39.136]  I get emails every week going, you're a liar.
[00:24:39.177 --> 00:24:41.018]  Bush didn't say he'd sign the assault weapons ban.
[00:24:41.038 --> 00:24:42.920]  We'll email him back and go, here's the news link.
[00:24:43.743 --> 00:24:45.705]  They'll email back, I apologize.
[00:24:46.105 --> 00:24:46.946]  I can't believe it.
[00:24:47.406 --> 00:24:50.369]  I called the NRA, and they wouldn't talk about it.
[00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:52.671]  They just said, well, we're neutral on it.
[00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:58.876]  Folks, we're about to go to Emmett, Ethan, John, and others.
[00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:00.258]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:00.298 --> 00:25:02.259]  Then I'll get into all this Second Amendment news also.
[00:25:06.308 --> 00:25:10.851]  Dollar drops, folks, to record lows against the Euro.
[00:25:10.971 --> 00:25:13.292]  And no, this is not old news of last week.
[00:25:13.352 --> 00:25:14.753]  It's dropping every day.
[00:25:15.554 --> 00:25:17.335]  It's dropping more and more.
[00:25:18.655 --> 00:25:20.076]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:25:20.256 --> 00:25:22.278]  And we'll talk about what that means for our economy.
[00:25:22.358 --> 00:25:24.779]  Also, Bush presides over biggest growth in U.S.
[00:25:24.819 --> 00:25:25.780]  spending since 1990.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.880]  Judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:25:29.902 --> 00:25:31.583]  Judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:25:36.044 --> 00:25:38.045]  What do you see happening around you?
[00:25:39.306 --> 00:25:40.827]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[00:25:40.887 --> 00:25:42.889]  Let's talk to Emmett in Pennsylvania.
[00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:45.090]  Thanks for holding first caller of the day.
[00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:45.551]  Go ahead.
[00:25:46.031 --> 00:25:51.995]  Yes, I hate to rub it in, but how about 36 over 10 equals over the Cowboys?
[00:25:53.917 --> 00:25:55.098]  Yes, it's very important.
[00:25:55.618 --> 00:25:56.859]  Yes, I know.
[00:25:57.379 --> 00:26:00.501]  Why, Alex, does two wrongs make a right?
[00:26:01.642 --> 00:26:05.565]  I'm glad that you've talked about Joe McCarthy and that he's vindicated.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.641]  But he was a Catholic.
[00:26:08.621 --> 00:26:09.922]  I'm not a Catholic basher.
[00:26:09.982 --> 00:26:14.944]  I buy Gregorian chants and basses and listen to them myself.
[00:26:15.764 --> 00:26:19.446]  But the Catholic Church backed Hitler early in his rise to power.
[00:26:19.966 --> 00:26:21.247]  Well, a lot of people did.
[00:26:22.168 --> 00:26:27.952]  A lot of the establishments, Zionist groups funded him, the Rothschilds funded him, that's now known.
[00:26:29.192 --> 00:26:35.956]  The British Crown was funding him, the Bushes were funding him, Roosevelt was involved with him, about everybody was.
[00:26:36.557 --> 00:26:40.939]  There were New Yorker articles in the late 30s about how wonderful Hitler was.
[00:26:40.959 --> 00:26:43.361]  Oh, I see.
[00:26:44.326 --> 00:26:46.127]  My grandfather lived out in Midland for a while.
[00:27:15.674 --> 00:27:22.639]  So, yeah, the entire establishment created the Nazis and then protected them, and they hung a couple of them for a show trial.
[00:27:23.099 --> 00:27:40.031]  And then they brought legislation here, like the 68 Gun Control Act, taking word from word from the 1938 Nazi Gun Control Act, and Senator Dodd took that out of the Library of Congress letter, had it translated and passed, because he was a young assistant prosecutor in 1946 in Deutschland.
[00:27:43.373 --> 00:27:51.057]  Well, you know, this latest statement by Bush that the Muslims worship the same God as the Christians really is throwing the neocons a curve.
[00:27:51.638 --> 00:27:54.199]  Yeah, it is not the same God, folks.
[00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:54.880]  No.
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.161]  But that's very popular in these neocon churches.
[00:27:58.922 --> 00:28:00.883]  They just haven't read the Koran.
[00:28:02.384 --> 00:28:02.824]  I have.
[00:28:03.785 --> 00:28:06.026]  Not the whole thing, but I've read quite a bit of it.
[00:28:06.046 --> 00:28:07.847]  Good.
[00:28:08.226 --> 00:28:09.986]  Well, thank you very much for taking my call.
[00:28:10.206 --> 00:28:10.727]  Thank you.
[00:28:10.847 --> 00:28:11.427]  I appreciate it.
[00:28:11.707 --> 00:28:13.887]  Yes, Allah is the moon god.
[00:28:13.927 --> 00:28:14.908]  Now, that's the Quran.
[00:28:16.128 --> 00:28:18.108]  That's why their symbol is the crescent moon, folks.
[00:28:18.929 --> 00:28:24.470]  Allah was his family god, was Muhammad's family god, and that's the god he chose.
[00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.071]  There at Mecca was kind of a crossroads.
[00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:28.251]  They had hundreds of gods there.
[00:28:28.271 --> 00:28:30.391]  It was a worship center for everybody, and he chose that god.
[00:28:31.052 --> 00:28:32.152]  Ethan in Kentucky.
[00:28:32.232 --> 00:28:32.832]  Ethan, go ahead.
[00:28:33.673 --> 00:28:34.033]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:34.094 --> 00:28:34.594]  Hi, Alex.
[00:28:34.654 --> 00:28:35.595]  Thanks for putting me on.
[00:28:35.715 --> 00:28:37.756]  First of all, I just want to say that I love your show.
[00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:38.857]  I listen to you every day.
[00:28:38.897 --> 00:28:41.379]  I update your website every day.
[00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:43.000]  Don't ever stop.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:51.546]  And I want to say that I am a left-leaning libertarian, but I am anti-gun control.
[00:28:52.046 --> 00:28:57.730]  And as a liberal, I think that gun control is a gross infringement on individual liberty and civil rights.
[00:28:59.068 --> 00:29:01.589]  Well, Thomas Jefferson said he was a liberal.
[00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:07.431]  I mean, I'm a liberal when it comes to putting ketchup on my French fries, but you don't mean you're the type of liberal that Bill Clinton is.
[00:29:07.592 --> 00:29:15.795]  No, no, I think that the modern-day Democrats and the modern-day liberals are a joke, and they're not what they say they are.
[00:29:17.034 --> 00:29:18.815]  Well, I totally agree, and neither is Bush.
[00:29:18.855 --> 00:29:21.616]  They're really all voting for the same package of lies.
[00:29:21.676 --> 00:29:23.837]  Yeah, it's just two sides of the same corrupt coin.
[00:29:24.157 --> 00:29:25.218]  I tell you what, stay there, Ethan.
[00:29:25.238 --> 00:29:27.158]  I'll let you talk a little more on the other side and finish up.
[00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:28.359]  We'll go to John and others.
[00:29:28.379 --> 00:29:33.581]  Total free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:35.402 --> 00:29:38.423]  You're welcome to call in about whatever you want.
[00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:39.524]  We'll get back to you in a second, Ethan.
[00:29:41.016 --> 00:29:42.458]  Disagree with me, agree with me, whatever.
[00:29:42.558 --> 00:29:46.381]  I'd like some folks to comment on the Second Amendment about to go bye-bye.
[00:29:46.401 --> 00:29:48.804]  Supreme Court says they can ban your guns.
[00:29:51.426 --> 00:29:52.327]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.828 --> 00:29:54.429]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.053]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:07.265]  Oh my... I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:30:07.425 --> 00:30:08.025]  Yes, it's true.
[00:30:08.045 --> 00:30:10.807]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:30:10.947 --> 00:30:14.910]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:15.590]  You heard it right.
[00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:20.713]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:30:20.813 --> 00:30:21.814]  The list goes on and on.
[00:30:21.954 --> 00:30:22.394]  We're good to go.
[00:30:38.993 --> 00:30:39.633]  We're good to go.
[00:30:39.653 --> 00:30:40.094]  We're good to go.
[00:31:08.464 --> 00:31:11.205]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[00:31:11.665 --> 00:31:14.527]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[00:31:14.907 --> 00:31:22.050]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:23.450]  That's recovery?
[00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:29.273]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[00:31:29.673 --> 00:31:31.234]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[00:31:31.894 --> 00:31:34.635]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[00:31:39.341 --> 00:31:39.882]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[00:31:39.902 --> 00:31:40.102]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:32:00.734 --> 00:32:03.215]  Do you hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days?
[00:32:03.315 --> 00:32:03.815]  Pollution.
[00:32:03.835 --> 00:32:04.135]  Pollen.
[00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.276]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:05.756]  Allergies.
[00:32:05.876 --> 00:32:06.176]  Asthma.
[00:32:06.196 --> 00:32:06.796]  Probably not.
[00:32:06.897 --> 00:32:07.657]  Well, listen to this.
[00:32:07.897 --> 00:32:16.861]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[00:32:16.921 --> 00:32:17.761]  Six to ten times?
[00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:18.861]  How can that be, you ask?
[00:32:18.941 --> 00:32:19.181]  Worse.
[00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:20.622]  Think about what's inside your home.
[00:32:20.782 --> 00:32:21.462]  Hairspray.
[00:32:21.562 --> 00:32:22.063]  Chemicals.
[00:32:22.363 --> 00:32:23.043]  Does anyone smoke?
[00:32:23.063 --> 00:32:23.323]  Fumes.
[00:32:23.483 --> 00:32:25.164]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:32:25.604 --> 00:32:27.185]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:32:27.205 --> 00:32:27.965]  Toxic fumes.
[00:32:27.985 --> 00:32:29.045]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[00:32:29.065 --> 00:32:29.286]  They go...
[00:32:30.834 --> 00:32:31.354]  Into you.
[00:32:31.595 --> 00:32:32.395]  Into your children.
[00:32:32.455 --> 00:32:32.996]  Their lungs.
[00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:33.856]  Am I scaring you?
[00:32:34.196 --> 00:32:35.097]  Remember this word.
[00:32:35.497 --> 00:32:36.218]  Puritech.
[00:32:36.258 --> 00:32:37.779]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:40.041]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[00:32:40.201 --> 00:32:52.750]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:54.111]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[00:32:54.131 --> 00:32:54.191]  888-491-4100.
[00:32:54.251 --> 00:32:55.271]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:56.092]  Online at Puritech.com.
[00:33:02.114 --> 00:33:04.896]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:05.456 --> 00:33:08.799]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.262 --> 00:33:17.664]  All right, we're halfway into this first hour of this December 8, 2003 edition.
[00:33:17.925 --> 00:33:20.426]  In fact, it's 33 minutes and 20 seconds into the hour.
[00:33:21.807 --> 00:33:31.714]  We're about to go back to the loaded phone lines and then into the economy, the growth of government, Mexican troops attacking and kidnapping and shooting at people, new developments there.
[00:33:33.322 --> 00:33:37.756]  A bunch of government officials and the Clinton White House people ending up dead.
[00:33:39.438 --> 00:33:42.461]  Very, very interesting info for you here on the show.
[00:34:04.582 --> 00:34:06.784]  Saying, hey, you're not allowed to own guns.
[00:34:06.824 --> 00:34:09.246]  We can ban whatever we want, whenever we want.
[00:34:09.266 --> 00:34:09.866]  Your comments?
[00:34:10.287 --> 00:34:11.768]  Well, of course, I'm not surprised.
[00:34:11.808 --> 00:34:14.229]  They're not true conservatives.
[00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:18.552]  They are tyrants, and they want to disarm the population so they can put us under total control.
[00:34:19.573 --> 00:34:21.635]  I'm not surprised at all.
[00:34:22.856 --> 00:34:32.923]  And you call yourself a liberal, agreeing on the Second Amendment, but Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh run offense and defense for Bush covering this up and not telling their audience.
[00:34:33.823 --> 00:34:36.785]  Yeah, I mean, I'm totally against gun control.
[00:34:37.386 --> 00:34:37.726]  Totally.
[00:34:37.926 --> 00:34:40.007]  And I do consider myself a liberal.
[00:34:40.107 --> 00:34:49.294]  There are other issues that I'm more liberal on, but I am for the most limited, small, decentralized government that gets more of a right, I guess.
[00:34:50.094 --> 00:34:50.755]  That's what I agree with.
[00:34:51.115 --> 00:34:53.597]  Most other things I'm more liberal on, but when it comes to gun control...
[00:34:54.464 --> 00:34:57.485]  It's a personal, individual right that should never be infringed.
[00:34:57.745 --> 00:34:58.365]  All right, Ethan.
[00:34:58.665 --> 00:35:00.746]  There's two quick things I want to talk about real quick.
[00:35:00.766 --> 00:35:01.366]  Okay, real quick.
[00:35:01.826 --> 00:35:07.008]  The first thing was about the Mexican military's recent actions.
[00:35:07.408 --> 00:35:07.588]  Yes.
[00:35:07.688 --> 00:35:12.269]  And I understand that nothing is being done at all by our authorities here.
[00:35:12.989 --> 00:35:13.330]  Yes.
[00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:18.111]  About two weeks ago, well, now more than two weeks ago, a family of five was kidnapped.
[00:35:19.055 --> 00:35:20.616]  Well, here's what I think we should do.
[00:35:20.636 --> 00:35:25.620]  I mean, I'm sure that we would be labeled terrorists for doing this, and I'm not racist, but if this keeps happening...
[00:35:47.555 --> 00:35:52.821]  We need to organize 500 to 1,000-person strong militia and march into Mexico and take them back.
[00:35:54.623 --> 00:35:55.945]  Well, why would that be racist?
[00:35:56.025 --> 00:36:01.712]  I mean, if you go down to Mexico, there are black people, white people, folks of Indian stock...
[00:36:02.479 --> 00:36:06.641]  And they oppress their own population.
[00:36:06.701 --> 00:36:12.304]  If you try to go into Mexico, they'll basically shake you down for money for no reason.
[00:36:13.144 --> 00:36:15.145]  Why don't they say it's racist when that happens?
[00:36:15.785 --> 00:36:18.647]  And thanks for the call, Ethan.
[00:36:19.107 --> 00:36:19.787]  I've got to let you go.
[00:36:19.827 --> 00:36:20.728]  I appreciate the call.
[00:36:22.429 --> 00:36:29.972]  Look, 80-plus percent of Hispanic Americans are against the open borders and against the illegals pouring across.
[00:36:31.193 --> 00:36:31.433]  Okay?
[00:36:32.515 --> 00:36:33.515]  Because it's common sense.
[00:36:33.556 --> 00:36:34.616]  It's killing our economy.
[00:36:34.676 --> 00:36:36.017]  It's bad for our society.
[00:36:36.317 --> 00:36:37.657]  It's driving down the wages.
[00:36:38.978 --> 00:36:39.538]  It's horrible.
[00:36:40.058 --> 00:36:42.900]  But the media tries to make it an issue of race.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.121]  Well, what is the race of somebody in Mexico?
[00:36:45.401 --> 00:36:46.701]  You can't even say what it is.
[00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:50.003]  It's a bunch of different races, a bunch of different mixed groups.
[00:36:51.563 --> 00:36:57.346]  And Mexico is using kind of a reconquista, reconquer the Southwest mentality
[00:36:57.986 --> 00:37:08.671]  Nationalism, as Washington gets rid of our nationalism, and encourages and funds the balkanization of the Southwest to make us more easily controlled.
[00:37:09.011 --> 00:37:10.032]  So that's what's really going on.
[00:37:10.512 --> 00:37:12.513]  John in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[00:37:12.553 --> 00:37:12.993]  Go ahead.
[00:37:13.413 --> 00:37:14.574]  Yes, hello, Alex.
[00:37:14.954 --> 00:37:19.636]  Look, Alex, there's something else to be said about the Judge Moore case that hasn't been discussed.
[00:37:20.196 --> 00:37:24.598]  For maximum effect, the powers that be picked the decadent South
[00:37:25.103 --> 00:37:27.866]  In the middle of the Bible Belt to outlaw God.
[00:37:28.247 --> 00:37:34.274]  And they did this very deliberately to humble the southern people and the whole Christian movement.
[00:37:34.995 --> 00:37:36.316]  It was not an accident.
[00:37:36.336 --> 00:37:41.382]  They could have picked any other place in the country to do their evil deeds, but they picked
[00:37:41.877 --> 00:37:44.839]  Birmingham, Montgomery, Alabama, the middle of the Bible Belt.
[00:37:44.879 --> 00:37:45.539]  How does that grab you?
[00:37:45.959 --> 00:37:54.764]  Well, there are dozens of federal courthouses and buildings that have the Ten Commandments and other Christian icons in them.
[00:37:54.784 --> 00:37:56.224]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:37:56.405 --> 00:37:57.485]  And you're absolutely right.
[00:37:57.645 --> 00:38:07.870]  And now I have the reports stacked up in front of me where Dowd and Galveston, Texas, and I have the Associated Press here, folks, a federal judge said if one...
[00:38:10.342 --> 00:38:14.852]  Young person, in their acceptance speech, says the word Jesus.
[00:38:16.235 --> 00:38:19.302]  They will be arrested and served six months in prison.
[00:38:21.537 --> 00:38:28.122]  I have articles where kindergartners are caught saying, God is great, God is good, let us thank him for our food.
[00:38:28.522 --> 00:38:30.984]  They're being brought to the principal's office, threatened with arrest.
[00:38:31.124 --> 00:38:32.165]  Lawyers are involved.
[00:38:32.486 --> 00:38:33.486]  Parents are threatened.
[00:38:33.526 --> 00:38:34.647]  CPS is called.
[00:38:35.508 --> 00:38:37.910]  Second graders are caught bowing their heads at lunch.
[00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:41.592]  They say even silent prayer is a Christian symbol.
[00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:47.417]  Now again, separation of church and state was a Thomas Jefferson letter about not having the government...
[00:38:48.204 --> 00:38:53.746]  Running religion, not having the Christian faith in government.
[00:38:53.826 --> 00:38:55.566]  It was, let's not have the government.
[00:38:55.586 --> 00:38:57.087]  Well, what's the First Amendment say?
[00:38:57.607 --> 00:39:04.849]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:39:04.969 --> 00:39:15.752]  So it's the opposite, John, and now they're coming in with Soviet or Chinese-style rules, and notice it was a Republican-appointed judge...
[00:39:16.736 --> 00:39:18.776]  That threw out what Moore had to say.
[00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:20.237]  Again, I rest my case.
[00:39:20.277 --> 00:39:20.637]  Go ahead.
[00:39:20.897 --> 00:39:26.818]  Yes, the operative word there in the First Amendment is establishment, and that's never stressed like it ought to be.
[00:39:27.078 --> 00:39:29.699]  Look, old Judge Moore missed the golden opportunity.
[00:39:30.039 --> 00:39:31.399]  He put on a poor performance.
[00:39:31.439 --> 00:39:36.100]  He picked, as his defense lawyer prior, who wound up prosecuting him.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:42.221]  Moore missed the golden opportunity to make the case for God and country.
[00:39:42.705 --> 00:39:44.066]  And he simply blew it.
[00:39:44.186 --> 00:39:48.307]  I think he's a simple good man, but he did blow it.
[00:39:48.347 --> 00:39:48.627]  Go ahead.
[00:39:49.488 --> 00:39:54.670]  Well, no, I agree with you that he could have done a better job, but he's on the field.
[00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:58.651]  He's leading the fight on that issue, so I can't really criticize him.
[00:39:58.691 --> 00:39:59.791]  At least he did something.
[00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:00.652]  That's better than nothing.
[00:40:00.672 --> 00:40:01.572]  Thanks for the call.
[00:40:02.152 --> 00:40:02.512]  Go ahead.
[00:40:02.793 --> 00:40:03.393]  Unfortunately.
[00:40:03.733 --> 00:40:04.373]  Now, take care.
[00:40:05.113 --> 00:40:06.094]  Jeff in Texas.
[00:40:06.154 --> 00:40:07.014]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:40:07.074 --> 00:40:07.414]  Welcome.
[00:40:07.975 --> 00:40:08.555]  Hello, Alex.
[00:40:08.755 --> 00:40:08.935]  Yes.
[00:40:10.401 --> 00:40:11.482]  I've talked to you before.
[00:40:11.602 --> 00:40:14.063]  I'm the retired police chief.
[00:40:14.823 --> 00:40:23.087]  I tell you what, I think people, the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and I've traditionally always been a Republican.
[00:40:23.807 --> 00:40:30.310]  My family, my mother was chairman of a Republican Party in the county I was from.
[00:40:32.558 --> 00:40:40.481]  I see the only party that addresses what I believe in, and I think most conservatives would believe in, is the Libertarian Party.
[00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:45.202]  I find a lot of people don't know anything about the Libertarian Party.
[00:40:46.303 --> 00:40:59.447]  I think that the listeners of this show should really check out the Libertarian Party, because they're addressing these things about the Second Amendment, about immigration control.
[00:40:59.989 --> 00:41:01.810]  I mean, our troops should not be in Iraq.
[00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:03.171]  They should be on our damn border.
[00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:11.656]  And it amazes me, though, the ignorance the people have of the Bill of Rights.
[00:41:12.677 --> 00:41:18.941]  And when you look at the platforms of the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, they're doing the same thing.
[00:41:19.001 --> 00:41:20.042]  And it's, again...
[00:41:21.482 --> 00:41:21.642]  Well,
[00:41:44.881 --> 00:41:50.482]  Jeff, I think you've called once before, and you were talking about how they control areas through the police chiefs.
[00:41:50.502 --> 00:41:50.742]  They do.
[00:41:51.022 --> 00:41:52.663]  The feds run the system.
[00:41:53.023 --> 00:41:54.663]  This is how they're taking over America.
[00:41:54.743 --> 00:42:07.686]  But for those that just joined us, and to recap, the Supreme Court ruled that the circuit court out in San Francisco ruling that I read on air stands, and the ruling says they can ban any gun they want.
[00:42:08.006 --> 00:42:10.086]  There is no individual right to own guns.
[00:42:10.706 --> 00:42:12.967]  There is no Second Amendment for the average person.
[00:42:13.787 --> 00:42:34.747]  And now the Supreme Court has said, we agree with that, no need to hear the case, and Bush says he'll resign the assault weapons ban next year with added banned guns, and all over the country they're expanding the size of the BATF and local anti-gun police squads, taking the anti-drug funding and moving it over there for the war on guns, not the war on drugs.
[00:42:35.508 --> 00:42:37.750]  Your response, your take on that?
[00:42:38.733 --> 00:42:42.176]  I agree, absolutely.
[00:42:42.796 --> 00:42:44.257]  The war on drugs is a joke.
[00:42:45.238 --> 00:42:53.424]  I'll tell you, one of my officers, I had a reserve force at the department I worked at, and one of my officers was Chuck Norris.
[00:42:55.266 --> 00:43:03.332]  Chuck's a big, really a good guy, but he's a big Bush supporter, but I'm sending him your videos, by the way.
[00:43:03.352 --> 00:43:08.276]  He's very smart, and we were having a discussion
[00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:12.664]  A couple of years ago, he had filmed one of his shows.
[00:43:12.744 --> 00:43:16.048]  It was a Christmas show, and he was really having some trouble with CBS.
[00:43:16.068 --> 00:43:17.009]  And I said, what's the deal?
[00:43:17.029 --> 00:43:19.932]  And he said, they don't want me to mention baby Jesus.
[00:43:19.952 --> 00:43:21.053]  And I said, why?
[00:43:21.093 --> 00:43:22.374]  And he said, well, why do you think?
[00:43:22.875 --> 00:43:29.822]  He said, the Jewish influence in the media is really, really strong.
[00:43:29.902 --> 00:43:31.223]  Now, I'm not anti-Jewish.
[00:43:31.403 --> 00:43:33.105]  In fact, I'm not at all.
[00:43:33.638 --> 00:43:34.899]  I'm not anti-anything.
[00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:44.087]  No, I mean, certainly, but it's wrong for those executives who obviously don't like Christianity to try to mold things, and that's been on the record.
[00:43:44.707 --> 00:43:50.472]  And by the way, sir, I may have heard of you, because I know Chuck Norris came out to the Gray's property during that standoff.
[00:43:50.872 --> 00:43:52.654]  I know that he is a reserve deputy.
[00:43:52.694 --> 00:43:53.815]  I believe it's Plano.
[00:43:55.116 --> 00:43:55.516]  Terrell.
[00:43:55.836 --> 00:43:57.558]  He was a reserve police officer.
[00:43:57.598 --> 00:43:58.739]  I was a police chief there.
[00:43:59.398 --> 00:44:00.838]  Well, Terrell's a pretty big city.
[00:44:00.878 --> 00:44:02.139]  I know he's been involved with several.
[00:44:02.719 --> 00:44:03.879]  I think I've heard about you.
[00:44:04.439 --> 00:44:05.059]  You may have.
[00:44:05.199 --> 00:44:18.943]  I was in the media some after we made a pretty big... We got involved with the federal government, what they call a med operation, where you round up... It was targeting crack cocaine dealers.
[00:44:18.983 --> 00:44:23.264]  We arrested about 105 people, and he was involved in some of the arrests because they...
[00:44:26.215 --> 00:44:34.038]  The DEA wanted some publicity on it, and I said, one of my reserve officers is Chuck Norris, and he participated in some of the arrests.
[00:44:34.058 --> 00:44:39.400]  The problem is, Alex, that of the cases filed, 105, 60 of them were state cases.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.601]  None of them, there were no convictions from any of the state cases.
[00:44:43.982 --> 00:44:47.263]  The federal government took plea bargains and everything.
[00:44:48.003 --> 00:44:54.406]  There again, just an example that narcotics prohibition is not working.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:04.682]  Then I would encourage, as I said, and I had discussions with Chuck about this, the Libertarian Party's got the only answer to me on this.
[00:45:04.882 --> 00:45:08.183]  They don't say that drugs are good.
[00:45:08.923 --> 00:45:12.784]  They're just saying we're throwing a lot of money and it's not being successful.
[00:45:12.804 --> 00:45:15.864]  But you know, a lot of people are getting rich finding drugs in this country.
[00:45:16.105 --> 00:45:18.145]  Well, I mean, Jeff, let's look at the facts here.
[00:45:19.145 --> 00:45:20.305]  They banned alcohol.
[00:45:20.465 --> 00:45:22.846]  Alcoholism skyrocketed, tripled.
[00:45:23.826 --> 00:45:24.807]  Exactly.
[00:45:24.927 --> 00:45:27.528]  The organized crime... Prohibition does not work.
[00:45:27.988 --> 00:45:29.868]  Organized crime exploded in size.
[00:45:30.629 --> 00:45:32.169]  It corrupted local officials.
[00:45:32.249 --> 00:45:35.070]  It created to help them expand the regulators.
[00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:39.353]  But what it's done here, yeah, with our seizure laws.
[00:45:39.833 --> 00:45:42.656]  Some of those things are the most unconstitutional things there are, Alex.
[00:45:42.796 --> 00:45:48.920]  And now with the narcotics and drugs in general, we have more people in prison than ever before.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.402]  We have triple the heroin, double the cocaine on the streets.
[00:45:51.442 --> 00:45:54.625]  And I'm telling you right now, the CIA ships in the majority of it.
[00:45:55.105 --> 00:46:01.550]  And they're using these laws, Alex, to go after law-abiding citizens to get into your homes, to seize your guns.
[00:46:02.471 --> 00:46:03.131]  It's controlled.
[00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:04.192]  It's controlled.
[00:46:04.676 --> 00:46:11.498]  Well, now, I remember reading a lot of Dallas Morning News articles and Fort Worth Star-Telegram articles about Chuck Norris being a reserve police officer.
[00:46:11.638 --> 00:46:13.158]  Isn't he married to a police officer?
[00:46:13.558 --> 00:46:16.279]  Yes, his wife is a former California deputy sheriff.
[00:46:16.579 --> 00:46:17.219]  Yeah, I knew that.
[00:46:17.539 --> 00:46:19.480]  And I knew that Chuck liked to go out to scenes.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.761]  I mean, he showed up at the Gray's property, a landing in a helicopter.
[00:46:22.801 --> 00:46:24.661]  He was very sympathetic with Gray's.
[00:46:24.901 --> 00:46:29.083]  Chuck's really a conservative, but like a lot of conservatives, Alex...
[00:46:30.748 --> 00:46:32.749]  The Republican Party's got a lot of them fools.
[00:46:33.029 --> 00:46:34.530]  And I was a Republican for years.
[00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.111]  I'm a life member of the NRA.
[00:46:36.851 --> 00:46:38.772]  But I don't like where it's going now.
[00:46:39.993 --> 00:46:41.194]  I'm kind of like Neil Knox.
[00:46:41.954 --> 00:46:46.756]  But Chuck, I'm sending him your videos.
[00:46:47.097 --> 00:46:48.057]  He knows of you.
[00:46:48.517 --> 00:46:50.138]  We've spoken of you quite a bit.
[00:46:51.039 --> 00:46:53.700]  He admires you.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.062]  But we've got to get these videos out to people.
[00:46:58.536 --> 00:46:59.417]  Well, that's amazing.
[00:46:59.477 --> 00:47:00.678]  Chuck Norris admires me.
[00:47:00.838 --> 00:47:01.678]  Yes, he does.
[00:47:01.758 --> 00:47:04.240]  I don't know why, but... He does.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:10.024]  Well, I hope that, Jeff, you'll send me a letter with all your info, and I could have you on as a guest sometime.
[00:47:10.364 --> 00:47:11.325]  I'll be glad to, Alex.
[00:47:11.625 --> 00:47:20.831]  Yeah, just send me a letter, and inside attention, Alex Jones, and how I can get in touch with you, Jeff, and I'd like to have you on as a guest.
[00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:23.393]  Well, Alex, you're, to me, a voice in wilderness.
[00:47:23.433 --> 00:47:24.514]  You're doing a great job.
[00:47:24.574 --> 00:47:26.335]  I just wish people would wake up.
[00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:31.441]  And thank God we have you.
[00:47:31.821 --> 00:47:33.922]  Well, no, I mean, thank God we've got people like you out there.
[00:47:34.282 --> 00:47:34.962]  Jeff, take care.
[00:47:34.982 --> 00:47:36.083]  All right, bye, Alex.
[00:47:36.183 --> 00:47:36.563]  You bet.
[00:47:36.603 --> 00:47:48.830]  Yeah, I've been at old stomping grounds there in Terrell, Texas, but I knew that he was involved with the Plano Police Department, and I do remember Terrell as well, raiding crack houses.
[00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:57.314]  So Chuck Norris is actually the real deal, likes to run into crack houses, getting shot at by drug dealers.
[00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:58.690]  We're good to go.
[00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:59.071]  I think?
[00:48:19.224 --> 00:48:21.226]  I do want to hear from callers on this subject.
[00:48:21.266 --> 00:48:23.447]  I mean, what do you think about what's happening to the Second Amendment?
[00:48:23.548 --> 00:48:24.628]  I mean, we're losing it.
[00:48:24.769 --> 00:48:30.513]  We're losing the bedrock of America, the First and Second Amendment, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Tenth.
[00:48:30.733 --> 00:48:31.674]  We're losing it all.
[00:48:32.134 --> 00:48:33.275]  Paul in Indiana.
[00:48:33.315 --> 00:48:34.236]  Paul, you're on the air.
[00:48:34.316 --> 00:48:34.756]  Go ahead.
[00:48:34.877 --> 00:48:35.357]  Hey, Alex.
[00:48:35.517 --> 00:48:36.038]  How you doing?
[00:48:36.398 --> 00:48:36.798]  Good, sir.
[00:48:36.978 --> 00:48:37.198]  Good.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:47.787]  I was watching C-SPAN the other day and saw a really encouraging debate at Boston University.
[00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:56.735]  And the topic of the debate was, are we losing our civil liberties in the war against terrorism?
[00:48:57.675 --> 00:49:14.385]  And they had three people on each side of the issue giving their arguments, and there must have been four or five hundred kids and students in the audience, and
[00:49:15.439 --> 00:49:36.029]  After it was all said and done, of course they had the president of the ACLU up there, and it was all said and done, and the moderator said, okay, if you're for the argument that we are losing our civil liberties, move over to the left, and if you don't think we are, then move to the right.
[00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:44.734]  I'm telling you, there was like 98% of those kids and students were on the left, and
[00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:46.171]  We're good to go.
[00:49:46.191 --> 00:49:46.391]  I think?
[00:50:06.105 --> 00:50:08.827]  Or a knowledge that, you know, how bad it's getting.
[00:50:08.847 --> 00:50:13.490]  Well, I'll tell you, Paul, I've been on over, and I keep saying this because it's such good news.
[00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:15.391]  It's not, ooh, I've been on a bunch of radio shows.
[00:50:15.431 --> 00:50:16.172]  It's the good news.
[00:50:16.912 --> 00:50:24.177]  I've done 1,300-plus radio interviews in the last 26 months, or more than 26 months now, since 9-11.
[00:50:24.737 --> 00:50:28.800]  And I'm telling you, a caller who disagrees with what I'm saying is the rarity.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.482]  Everybody instinctively knows there's a problem now.
[00:50:33.422 --> 00:50:34.683]  And you saw that on C-SPAN.
[00:50:34.723 --> 00:50:39.645]  You say 98% of the people lining up were against the Patriot Act?
[00:50:39.845 --> 00:50:41.165]  Yeah, at least 98%.
[00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:42.946]  Anything else you'd like to add about this?
[00:50:42.986 --> 00:50:45.847]  You know, I just wanted to ask you... Stay there.
[00:50:46.227 --> 00:50:46.507]  Stay there.
[00:50:46.527 --> 00:50:48.248]  We'll get your question after the break, Paul.
[00:50:48.268 --> 00:50:48.768]  We've got a break.
[00:50:49.188 --> 00:50:51.870]  And we'll come back and let you finish up, go to Doris and others.
[00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:55.271]  Then I am going to shift gears and get into the economy and the war.
[00:50:55.431 --> 00:50:56.852]  And just believe me, you want to stay with us.
[00:50:56.892 --> 00:50:57.692]  It's very important news.
[00:51:01.429 --> 00:51:07.352]  Oh my... I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:51:07.492 --> 00:51:08.112]  Yes, it's true.
[00:51:08.132 --> 00:51:10.874]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:51:11.014 --> 00:51:14.996]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:51:15.076 --> 00:51:15.676]  You heard it right.
[00:51:15.816 --> 00:51:20.778]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:51:20.878 --> 00:51:21.899]  The list goes on and on.
[00:51:22.159 --> 00:51:23.100]  You may miss out forever.
[00:51:39.071 --> 00:51:39.431]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.226 --> 00:52:01.806]  Hello, folks.
[00:52:01.846 --> 00:52:02.806]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:52:03.186 --> 00:52:08.927]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:52:09.187 --> 00:52:14.308]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:52:14.648 --> 00:52:23.970]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:29.231]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:52:29.571 --> 00:52:33.593]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:52:33.773 --> 00:52:38.555]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:52:38.915 --> 00:52:44.817]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:52:58.463 --> 00:52:59.564]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.825 --> 00:53:04.706]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:53:05.422 --> 00:53:06.723]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:53:06.923 --> 00:53:12.667]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:53:12.947 --> 00:53:18.210]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:22.653]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:53:22.813 --> 00:53:26.615]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:31.518]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:53:31.578 --> 00:53:34.320]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.821]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:53:37.881 --> 00:53:39.741]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:53:40.181 --> 00:53:42.282]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.

[00:53:54.004 --> 00:53:56.024]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:53:56.224 --> 00:53:57.745]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:53:57.925 --> 00:53:59.985]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:54:06.141 --> 00:54:08.062]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.542 --> 00:54:11.363]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:13.724 --> 00:54:25.929]  A lot of establishment types care about the country, but it takes real moral courage to admit the type of corrupt system we're living under and to stand up and speak out against it.
[00:54:27.045 --> 00:54:38.648]  It's very easy to rationalize, but we wouldn't have all these dirty crack dens and your daughters wouldn't be crack whores or heroin heads if drugs were decriminalized.
[00:54:39.668 --> 00:54:40.788]  It's just a fact, folks.
[00:54:41.228 --> 00:54:48.590]  You could buy heroin, cocaine for the price of bubble gum literally 60, 70, 80 years ago in this country.
[00:54:51.201 --> 00:54:53.823]  And drug use was a lot lower than it is today.
[00:54:54.324 --> 00:55:06.153]  But you make it illegal, you add money to it, and jet boats and Porsches and million-dollar houses, it becomes a status symbol, and then you recruit an army of salesmen.
[00:55:07.354 --> 00:55:17.062]  I mean, let's say if somebody suddenly made corn, you know, $100 a can, suddenly there'd be a lot of corn salesmen out there, wouldn't there?
[00:55:18.184 --> 00:55:22.406]  Instead, it's a couple dollars a bushel, so nobody really wants to sell corn.
[00:55:22.466 --> 00:55:27.328]  So that's kind of a weird analogy, but I hope it gets through to you.
[00:55:27.428 --> 00:55:28.629]  You create the crime.
[00:55:28.669 --> 00:55:31.770]  You create the laws people are breaking.
[00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:33.251]  You add a bunch of money to it.
[00:55:33.631 --> 00:55:35.311]  I mean, look, I'm not for the drug dealers.
[00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:36.872]  They're a bunch of trash, most of them.
[00:55:36.892 --> 00:55:38.613]  A bunch of weaselly trash.
[00:55:38.633 --> 00:55:40.674]  A bunch of hopped-up idiots.
[00:55:40.974 --> 00:55:41.774]  They kill cops.
[00:55:41.814 --> 00:55:42.675]  They kill citizens.
[00:55:43.015 --> 00:55:45.596]  Nine out of ten robberies are some drug head.
[00:55:46.969 --> 00:55:48.329]  They're causing the crime.
[00:55:48.629 --> 00:55:51.450]  Since they have the war on drugs, our crime rate goes up and up and up.
[00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:54.250]  It's not meant to stop the drugs, people.
[00:55:56.251 --> 00:55:58.091]  Let's go back to Paul and let him finish up.
[00:55:58.151 --> 00:55:59.731]  Paul in Indiana, go ahead.
[00:55:59.991 --> 00:56:14.114]  Alex, I heard you mention briefly that story in the Associated Press about the judge in Texas that made some new law about if a student in his...
[00:56:15.287 --> 00:56:24.395]  Graduation speech mentions God or Jesus, that they automatically serve a six-month sentence or something like that?
[00:56:24.475 --> 00:56:25.776]  Yes, for contempt of court.
[00:56:26.957 --> 00:56:28.698]  I'd really like to read that article.
[00:56:28.758 --> 00:56:41.409]  Do you have any kind of a... Yes, it is deep in last Friday's stack, but I can dig it out later in the next hour, and there's also a WorldNet Daily article from Friday on it here in the stack, and it lists...
[00:56:41.909 --> 00:56:46.010]  About, I don't know, five, six different cases of kindergartners, second graders.
[00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:47.611]  This is happening everywhere.
[00:56:48.231 --> 00:56:54.193]  But now just praying or saying the word Jesus, they're confiscating Bibles, you name it.
[00:56:54.933 --> 00:56:57.093]  And these cases are all over the place.
[00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:58.514]  But, yes, I'll dig the article out.
[00:56:58.854 --> 00:56:59.094]  Great.
[00:56:59.114 --> 00:56:59.914]  I appreciate it.
[00:56:59.954 --> 00:57:01.595]  In fact, let me tell Paul Watson to do this.
[00:57:01.615 --> 00:57:02.235]  I know he's listening.
[00:57:02.595 --> 00:57:06.016]  Paul, will you post those on prisonplanet.com?
[00:57:07.399 --> 00:57:09.980]  Because for some reason I didn't see those on Friday on the site.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:11.700]  I printed them, but we didn't have them posted.
[00:57:13.741 --> 00:57:14.641]  Thanks for the call, Paul.
[00:57:14.721 --> 00:57:15.321]  I appreciate it.
[00:57:15.341 --> 00:57:15.862]  Take care, Alex.
[00:57:16.262 --> 00:57:17.022]  Good to hear from you.
[00:57:17.722 --> 00:57:19.783]  And I wasn't talking to the caller telling him to post him.
[00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:22.044]  I was talking to Paul Watson, not Paul from Indiana.
[00:57:22.804 --> 00:57:26.705]  Before I end this hour and come back with Doris and Jacob and others...
[00:57:28.425 --> 00:57:43.158]  I want to encourage every listener out there to join me this Saturday at the Alamo Draft House Movie Theater, beautiful movie theater, to show Road to Tyranny and John Carpenter's They Live at the West Oaks Shopping Center there at the...
[00:57:43.998 --> 00:57:45.679]  Alamo Drafthouse Movie Theater.
[00:57:45.979 --> 00:57:46.339]  6 p.m.
[00:57:46.379 --> 00:57:47.059]  I'll give a speech.
[00:57:47.359 --> 00:57:48.179]  Show Road to Tyranny.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.300]  Take questions.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.140]  Then we'll show the film.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.902]  It's an affair that will go from about 6 to 11.30 at night.
[00:57:56.342 --> 00:57:57.602]  Great place to network.
[00:57:57.662 --> 00:57:58.843]  Great place to meet people.
[00:57:58.883 --> 00:57:59.943]  Last time it sold out.
[00:58:00.463 --> 00:58:01.864]  So go to Infowars.com.
[00:58:01.904 --> 00:58:03.784]  Link through to the website of Alamo Drafthouse.
[00:58:03.824 --> 00:58:05.465]  Go ahead and pre-buy your tickets.
[00:58:05.805 --> 00:58:08.906]  I don't think it will be oversold this time because it's the second event.
[00:58:08.946 --> 00:58:09.606]  But who knows?
[00:58:10.206 --> 00:58:14.148]  Hope to see you there this Saturday in Houston, Texas.
[00:58:14.248 --> 00:58:21.050]  Also, get Road to Tyranny, get Masters of Terror, get Matrix is Evil, my new video, get Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:24.771]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get the videos.
[00:58:25.552 --> 00:58:30.894]  Or call toll-free to get the films and make copies of them and give them to people, like Jeff's going to do to Chuck Norris.
[00:58:30.914 --> 00:58:30.974]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:39.290]  Make the call.
[00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:39.370]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:40.111 --> 00:58:41.912]  And they make great gifts as well.
[00:58:42.032 --> 00:58:43.533]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:51.824 --> 00:59:02.557]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:59:02.738 --> 00:59:10.307]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:10.527 --> 00:59:19.718]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:59:19.998 --> 00:59:26.165]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:59:26.525 --> 00:59:30.406]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:59:30.446 --> 00:59:32.346]  The water level is always visible.
[00:59:32.526 --> 00:59:38.468]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:42.409]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:42.429 --> 00:59:42.929]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:59:58.004 --> 00:59:58.644]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.304 --> 01:00:00.345]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:02.165]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.825 --> 01:00:03.645]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.406 --> 01:00:05.306]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.326 --> 01:00:09.727]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.147 --> 01:00:14.268]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.229 --> 01:00:17.369]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:18.129 --> 01:00:25.551]  Already into the second hour of this December 8th, 2003 global edition of the show.
[01:00:26.329 --> 01:00:41.460]  As we blast out on the AM and FM dials, simulcast on global shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20, two different frequencies to choose from depending on where you're listening on the globe, and at night at 5.085 and 68.90.
[01:00:41.861 --> 01:00:45.563]  The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:00:45.964 --> 01:00:49.747]  Doris and Jacob and Dan and others, your calls are coming up here in about 15 minutes.
[01:00:50.187 --> 01:00:52.589]  I want to go ahead and launch into news right now.
[01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:56.132]  Again, the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:56.172 --> 01:00:58.435]  Wide open phones, taking a lot of calls.
[01:00:58.615 --> 01:01:00.937]  On today's edition, 1-800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air.
[01:01:09.372 --> 01:01:13.015]  We've heard from a few of the callers on this subject, but I think it's important to just recap it.
[01:01:13.335 --> 01:01:24.125]  The Supreme Court ruled that they agree with the appeals court out in San Francisco that they can ban any gun they want and that you have no Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
[01:01:24.925 --> 01:01:30.210]  The Republican-controlled court agrees with the most socialistic liberal court based out in San Francisco.
[01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:34.834]  This has national implications, and states are already moving
[01:01:35.669 --> 01:01:40.193]  To go after the Second Amendment using this ruling.
[01:01:40.814 --> 01:01:42.516]  And Bush says he'll sign the assault weapons ban.
[01:01:42.876 --> 01:01:44.378]  What do you think about them apples?
[01:01:45.298 --> 01:01:52.445]  Jumping into global financial news, dollar drops to record against euro, 11-year low, versus the pound.
[01:01:53.326 --> 01:01:56.509]  And gold was at like $407.50-something cents last night.
[01:02:00.712 --> 01:02:01.773]  I looked at it this morning.
[01:02:01.813 --> 01:02:02.934]  It was about the same.
[01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:06.617]  In fact, during the break, I'll check gold again.
[01:02:06.657 --> 01:02:07.778]  That's a key indicator.
[01:02:08.098 --> 01:02:15.905]  When the economy's really going south, despite all their rhetoric to the contrary, saying it's in good shape, gold goes up.
[01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:19.448]  It's a harbinger of bad financial times.
[01:02:19.488 --> 01:02:21.389]  And I'm not pleased with this, but it's just the facts.
[01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:23.031]  Dollar drops to record...
[01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:28.331]  Against Euro, 11-year low versus the pound.
[01:02:28.571 --> 01:02:38.301]  Bloomberg Financial, the dollar dropped to a record 122 against the Euro and fell to its lowest in more than a decade versus the British pound.
[01:02:39.202 --> 01:02:46.364]  On speculation, the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates at a 45-year low in coming months, eroding the appeal of U.S.
[01:02:46.404 --> 01:02:46.964]  investments.
[01:02:47.024 --> 01:02:55.006]  Fed policymakers tomorrow will keep the target rate at 1%, according to 77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
[01:02:55.346 --> 01:03:02.308]  Half of the European Central Bank's rate since August, the Fed has said it will keep rates low for a considerable period.
[01:03:02.848 --> 01:03:03.268]  We're good to go.
[01:03:31.753 --> 01:03:36.717]  And in late Friday trading, it was at 121.70 in New York.
[01:03:36.737 --> 01:03:43.383]  The dollar slid to a low of 1.7363 against the pound, its weakest since October 92.
[01:03:43.423 --> 01:03:49.508]  And gold is trading right up at about $408 an ounce.
[01:03:49.528 --> 01:03:53.632]  I bought gold at 240, 300, 315 in my gold purchases the last two years.
[01:03:59.591 --> 01:04:03.896]  And I have bought a few collector's coins, but mainly I have bought bullion.
[01:04:04.637 --> 01:04:09.903]  I bought some semi-numismatic that have some collector's value, which makes them non-confiscatable.
[01:04:09.923 --> 01:04:13.026]  The government has confiscated gold for separate
[01:04:13.499 --> 01:04:15.659]  We're good to go.
[01:04:37.978 --> 01:04:45.142]  A bunch of pro-Second Amendment news of people defending themselves in a horrible tragedy case of a nap into a Second Amendment defender.
[01:04:46.223 --> 01:04:49.084]  And some of the martial law stuff in Iraq.
[01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:50.805]  It's all coming up.
[01:04:50.865 --> 01:04:51.546]  Stay with us.
[01:04:53.208 --> 01:04:57.553]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:57.733 --> 01:05:02.157]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:02.318 --> 01:05:06.662]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:05:06.722 --> 01:05:08.084]  The New World Order.
[01:05:08.824 --> 01:05:09.845]  Can emerge.
[01:05:09.866 --> 01:05:14.090]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:21.078]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:23.201]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.601 --> 01:05:33.925]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.205 --> 01:05:39.548]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:06:29.806 --> 01:06:30.507]  Not convinced yet?
[01:06:30.627 --> 01:06:34.351]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:34.851]  We're good to go.
[01:06:51.781 --> 01:06:55.042]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:06:55.102 --> 01:06:59.264]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:06:59.524 --> 01:07:02.326]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:07:02.506 --> 01:07:04.907]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:07:05.107 --> 01:07:13.750]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:07:13.951 --> 01:07:15.291]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:07:15.491 --> 01:07:19.733]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:07:19.973 --> 01:07:21.674]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:07:21.934 --> 01:07:33.902]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:07:34.082 --> 01:07:40.566]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:07:40.846 --> 01:07:47.429]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:50.470]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:07:53.512 --> 01:07:55.733]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:56.293 --> 01:07:59.174]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:04.697]  My friends...
[01:08:05.695 --> 01:08:10.640]  Since I got on the air nine years ago, I've learned a lot.
[01:08:12.681 --> 01:08:24.072]  But the core mission of the New World Order being the source of the tyranny in the world, fostering corruption, accentuating the evil that has already been part of human history, is clear.
[01:08:25.453 --> 01:08:30.978]  And I knew when I got on the air nine years ago that there was a plan with the European Union, because it had been stated before,
[01:08:32.415 --> 01:09:01.367]  By the big financial institutions and their own publications that the general public never read or see, that they would bring out the euro and by the big European banks owning and controlling our Federal Reserve, they would set up policies that would drive down the dollar, boost the euro to make a globalist system look good for the world and to centralize power and control and to get rid of our middle class to make us a more manageable population.
[01:09:03.032 --> 01:09:18.204]  And now if I tune into NPR, I hear them bragging about, well, the dollar plunging will teach Americans not to live outside their means, and we consume 40% of the world's goods, and we're only 5% of the population, and this is what we deserve, ha, ha, ha.
[01:09:18.924 --> 01:09:24.989]  But the average person, again, wasn't taught in college, wasn't taught in high school what currencies mean to a country.
[01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:27.931]  But a lot of you, I bet, have gone to Canada.
[01:09:27.971 --> 01:09:30.533]  A lot of you have gone to the Caribbean.
[01:09:30.573 --> 01:09:31.694]  You've gone to Mexico.
[01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:33.368]  We're good to go.
[01:10:01.135 --> 01:10:02.476]  We're good to go.
[01:10:02.496 --> 01:10:02.756]  I think?
[01:10:25.191 --> 01:10:28.833]  Last year, the euro's coming online, the dollar's going to start dropping, and it did.
[01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:31.515]  It wasn't hard to predict this, folks.
[01:10:31.555 --> 01:10:42.101]  The globalists had bragged three and a half years ago at the Davos World Economic Forum about how they were going to, quote, turn on the lights in Europe financially and turn off the lights of America.
[01:10:42.634 --> 01:10:52.719]  Their only concern was, and it said that the head of the World Bank was laughing, and the head of the IMF were laughing, Wolftonson and Michelle were laughing, going, we don't want it to be too tough on the Americans.
[01:10:52.759 --> 01:10:55.220]  It has to be slow and gradual.
[01:10:57.521 --> 01:11:01.243]  Meanwhile, don't think there's a fight between Bush and his European masters.
[01:11:01.303 --> 01:11:06.185]  Bush has Treasury Secretary Snowe out bad-mouthing the dollars, saying a dropping dollar is good.
[01:11:07.606 --> 01:11:08.286]  It's horrible.
[01:11:08.586 --> 01:11:11.508]  The Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates very low.
[01:11:12.436 --> 01:11:18.722]  And then Europe gives about double the interest rate for investors, and so everybody's going to Europe.
[01:11:18.802 --> 01:11:23.026]  Everybody's dumping the dollar, going to the Euro.
[01:11:25.308 --> 01:11:27.470]  This is very, very serious.
[01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:32.134]  And, you know, I said I'd check it during the break, and I didn't check it.
[01:11:32.174 --> 01:11:36.398]  I was busy thumbing around through these articles trying to find that World Net Daily and AP article about
[01:11:37.006 --> 01:11:44.229]  The judge down in South Texas saying that if people at their graduation ceremony say the word Jesus, they'll be given six months in jail.
[01:11:44.549 --> 01:11:46.130]  Hey, George, will you check that for me?
[01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:47.251]  Check the price of gold?
[01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:51.653]  I wanted to check that, and it's my fault I forgot during the break.
[01:11:52.693 --> 01:11:54.114]  But this morning it was right below $408.
[01:11:55.074 --> 01:11:58.116]  Again, when I was buying gold a couple years ago at $245 an ounce, folks.
[01:12:06.696 --> 01:12:10.379]  And so it's just been a massive, massive, massive increase.
[01:12:10.399 --> 01:12:12.301]  And it looks like there's no end to it in sight.
[01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:16.005]  But we'll get that number for you.
[01:12:16.045 --> 01:12:19.528]  But I guess it's really pointless to watch it rise short term.
[01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:21.249]  We'll have to see what happens.
[01:12:22.531 --> 01:12:26.034]  Bush presides over biggest growth in U.S.
[01:12:26.114 --> 01:12:27.015]  spending since 1990.
[01:12:30.538 --> 01:12:32.701]  The dried plant exhibit at the New York Botanical Gardens.
[01:12:47.577 --> 01:12:56.003]  Federal spending rose 7.3%, to $2.2 trillion in fiscal 2003, and 7.9% the year before.
[01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:56.824]  That's not true.
[01:12:56.884 --> 01:13:00.707]  I have other numbers that were saying it went up 24% the last two years.
[01:13:02.108 --> 01:13:08.593]  The most since George W. Bush's father, George Herbert Walker Bush, was in the White House.
[01:13:09.153 --> 01:13:12.095]  Congress will vote this week on a $328 billion fund
[01:13:16.443 --> 01:13:17.024]  How much did you say?
[01:13:38.216 --> 01:13:42.939]  $407.70.
[01:13:38.537 --> 01:13:42.939]  Okay, it hasn't changed since this morning.
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:46.222]  Gold is at $407.70.
[01:13:47.002 --> 01:13:48.403]  Thank you, George, for that info.
[01:13:50.704 --> 01:13:53.386]  The spending threatens Bush's pledge to cut the federal budget by 2008.
[01:13:53.466 --> 01:14:04.434]  The big boom you're having right now might not be sustainable if the deficit continues to be large, said Stephen Hess, an analyst with Moody's Investor Service.
[01:14:05.294 --> 01:14:06.515]  Now let's stop right there.
[01:14:08.055 --> 01:14:09.815]  MSNBC is laying people off.
[01:14:10.516 --> 01:14:12.956]  Speaking of ExxonMobil, they're engaged in layoffs.
[01:14:14.376 --> 01:14:21.998]  Boeing, Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola, IBM, you name it, they're laying people off year after year.
[01:14:22.018 --> 01:14:23.778]  We're, what, into year three of layoffs?
[01:14:24.058 --> 01:14:35.861]  They're shutting down plants for good, moving them to China, moving them to India, and they factor in the profits in Asia, in Europe, into our GDP, because these are, quote, American companies, which they're not really.
[01:14:38.088 --> 01:14:42.410]  And then you have the hundreds of billions that have been already spent on the war.
[01:14:42.931 --> 01:14:45.132]  And yes, those go into corporate profits.
[01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:47.693]  And the Fortune 500 came out this year.
[01:14:47.793 --> 01:14:49.074]  They all got richer.
[01:14:50.174 --> 01:14:52.015]  The Bill Gateses of the world all got richer.
[01:14:52.376 --> 01:14:53.776]  So the rich got richer.
[01:14:53.836 --> 01:14:55.657]  Government ballooned at record levels.
[01:14:55.777 --> 01:15:00.300]  But the average income of the American citizen went down massively.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.661]  Layoffs increased massively.
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.202]  You know, hardcore jobs that can sustain a family are disappearing, being annihilated.
[01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:18.444]  The bankruptcies, the corporate, the private, the public debt is exploding.
[01:15:18.624 --> 01:15:19.805]  Those are the real numbers.
[01:15:21.125 --> 01:15:29.067]  But of course here, right around Christmas, they're telling you how great the economy is because factory orders went up and a few other numbers like that.
[01:15:29.487 --> 01:15:31.308]  But here's your conservative president.
[01:15:32.105 --> 01:15:36.506]  And by the way, about half of the spending is military and police state.
[01:15:37.346 --> 01:15:38.687]  You could say, well, that was unforeseen.
[01:15:39.267 --> 01:15:53.210]  It'd still be record growth since 1990, if you look at the numbers, because Bush expanded the Department of Education, he expanded the Department of Transportation, he expanded almost every federal bureaucracy at levels above Bill Clinton!
[01:15:55.825 --> 01:15:58.046]  He signed on to UNESCO with the UN.
[01:15:58.146 --> 01:15:59.947]  I mean, again, I'm not a Democrat, folks.
[01:15:59.967 --> 01:16:01.448]  I'm not saying go out and vote for the Democrats.
[01:16:01.508 --> 01:16:10.673]  I'm saying let's be honest about the real policies of Bush and how the neocons on talk radio will not mention this.
[01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:19.998]  Very, very scary indeed to have this type of garbage taking place.
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.621]  We're good to go.
[01:16:44.022 --> 01:16:46.064]  The whole global warming argument isn't just about
[01:17:14.068 --> 01:17:14.628]  We're good to go.
[01:17:14.648 --> 01:17:14.848]  I think?
[01:17:44.358 --> 01:17:50.722]  Global warming could submerge three of India's biggest cities beneath the sea by 2020 unless the crisis was brought under control.
[01:17:50.782 --> 01:18:13.555]  An Indian scientist warned yesterday if the warming continues, there will be about half to one meter increase in sea level by 2020, and cities like Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras will be completely submerged, said Rajav Najam, a scientist with the Geological Oceanography Division of the Western Indian State of Goa.
[01:18:14.238 --> 01:18:25.165]  He said that a one-meter rise in sea level could cost 5 trillion rupees or 147.24 billion worth of damage to property in Goa alone.
[01:18:25.386 --> 01:18:31.350]  This is a quantum of damage in a small state like Goa that has only two districts.
[01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:34.312]  Imagine the extent of property loss in metros.
[01:18:34.832 --> 01:18:38.975]  In metros like Bombay, he added, at a workshop in the National College in Goa.
[01:18:39.655 --> 01:18:54.164]  He also predicted that the global warming could cause frequent cyclones along with coastal areas and affect the annual monsoon rain, which is crucial for India's farm dependency economy.
[01:18:55.926 --> 01:18:59.448]  Folks, most scientists say global warming is a complete fraud.
[01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:02.630]  You've got a lot of government-run scientists who will say it's real.
[01:19:03.214 --> 01:19:07.997]  You've got to remember, though, the global government admittedly has patented weather control systems.
[01:19:08.017 --> 01:19:09.138]  This is mainstream news.
[01:19:09.498 --> 01:19:10.959]  They can manipulate the weather.
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:13.481]  We do have natural cycles.
[01:19:14.401 --> 01:19:18.104]  We go into ice ages every 12,000 years and come out of those ice ages.
[01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:27.870]  We are actually due, according to North Pole and South Pole ice core samples, we're actually due for another ice age in the next 1,000 years.
[01:19:29.472 --> 01:19:35.815]  And we're just entering the peak of the heat cycle, which then triggers another cycle of freezing.
[01:19:36.475 --> 01:19:43.558]  But again, they're teaching everybody that global warming is a fact, and we've got to give up our cars and pay a global tax to stop it.
[01:19:44.519 --> 01:19:45.879]  And it is racing ahead.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.061]  Contrary to popular propaganda, Kyoto is alive and well.
[01:19:50.081 --> 01:19:51.782]  We'll be back with your calls and more news.
[01:19:53.584 --> 01:19:54.144]  You've heard of it.
[01:19:54.244 --> 01:19:55.124]  You've searched for it.
[01:19:55.284 --> 01:19:55.985]  We have it.
[01:19:56.145 --> 01:19:57.745]  I'm talking about Coral Calcium.

[01:20:56.361 --> 01:21:00.504]  Mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[01:21:00.904 --> 01:21:03.626]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[01:21:04.086 --> 01:21:06.968]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[01:21:07.348 --> 01:21:11.690]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:12.591]  That's recovery?
[01:21:16.482 --> 01:21:17.582]  I love the sound of real money.

[01:24:24.872 --> 01:24:26.732]  tighten grip on Iraq towns.
[01:24:26.752 --> 01:24:30.353]  They're turning them into Red Dawn-style concentration camps.
[01:24:31.613 --> 01:24:37.735]  Also, even Mr. Gingrich is saying we've gone off the side of a cliff in Iraq and we're in deep trouble.
[01:24:38.475 --> 01:24:39.875]  This is out of Newsweek and Time.
[01:24:39.915 --> 01:24:40.915]  Both have articles on it.
[01:24:41.896 --> 01:24:43.196]  We'll get into some of the layoffs.
[01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:55.404]  Also, Harrison crashed at airport, kills two whitewater figures, and some of Clinton's cronies who knew about all the dirt are dead.
[01:24:55.944 --> 01:25:05.268]  Also, top scientist advisor to four presidents dies violently in D.C., and there's some type of cover-up on that.
[01:25:06.548 --> 01:25:08.729]  Dean defends theory that Bush knew of 9-11 plot.
[01:25:11.131 --> 01:25:15.237]  Also, cursing Kerry unleashes foul-mouthed attack on Bush.
[01:25:15.317 --> 01:25:17.641]  Oh, those little skull and bones, buddy, throwing a fit.
[01:25:19.243 --> 01:25:22.688]  Also, police shut down highway and new sniper hunt.
[01:25:22.708 --> 01:25:23.749]  Now it's a sniper hunt.
[01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:24.751]  Another sniper.
[01:25:24.771 --> 01:25:25.432]  Isn't that horrible?
[01:25:26.418 --> 01:25:36.582]  Also, Fed's hype conviction rate in terror fight, critics say, turns out they're listing things as terrorism now, listing drug arrest, you name it, as terrorist, see?
[01:25:36.602 --> 01:25:39.382]  And oh, all the terrorists they've stopped.
[01:25:39.442 --> 01:25:45.024]  But when you go look up who the terrorists are, it wasn't terrorist events at all.
[01:25:45.905 --> 01:25:49.686]  Also, new bill will be the back door to legal euthanasia,
[01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:51.912]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[01:25:51.952 --> 01:25:53.013]  But first, your calls.
[01:25:53.133 --> 01:25:53.814]  Thanks for holding.
[01:25:54.154 --> 01:25:56.617]  Doris in Arkansas, you're on the air.
[01:25:56.637 --> 01:25:57.878]  Hello, Alex.
[01:25:58.039 --> 01:25:58.659]  Hello, Doris.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:03.284]  This wasn't what I was going to talk about, but I wanted to make a comment on it.
[01:26:03.845 --> 01:26:11.734]  When my children were young, I'm grateful that they had a teacher in a small school that led them in that little prayer you mentioned.
[01:26:12.248 --> 01:26:12.949]  God is great.
[01:26:13.009 --> 01:26:13.749]  God is good.
[01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:15.610]  Let us thank him for our food.
[01:26:17.491 --> 01:26:18.032]  Let me stop you.
[01:26:18.052 --> 01:26:20.473]  You'll be now expelled from school if you say that.
[01:26:20.934 --> 01:26:21.214]  Right.
[01:26:22.374 --> 01:26:30.380]  I think since we were founded as a Christian nation, those that are offended should just leave this nation and let us go on as a Christian nation.
[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.681]  But that wasn't what I called about.
[01:26:34.742 --> 01:26:39.545]  What does this new ruling by the Supreme Court do to...
[01:26:41.727 --> 01:26:50.790]  Sheriff Mack's case that he brought before the Supreme Court on states' rights and that they said that the Brady Bill was unconstitutional.
[01:26:52.630 --> 01:26:58.692]  Well, and yes, they did rule that it was unconstitutional in 97, but you notice the Brady Bill is still in force.
[01:26:58.812 --> 01:27:03.234]  If they don't like a ruling, the government just ignores it, the executive and legislative.
[01:27:04.294 --> 01:27:07.155]  If they like a ruling, they'll enforce it, and the appeals court...
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:21.150]  Out in San Francisco, they ruled a few months ago that there is no Second Amendment, that they can ban guns, any guns they wish, and the Supreme Court ruled that they agree with that ruling and are not going to hear the case.
[01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:26.013]  So does Sheriff Mack's case still stand?
[01:27:26.393 --> 01:27:33.939]  Well, each case is separate and different, and he won his case, but again, the Brady Bill was kept in force and expanded.
[01:27:40.265 --> 01:27:46.326]  Yes, the Supreme Court said that they're not allowed to have instant checks and checks and all that, but they don't care.
[01:27:46.366 --> 01:27:46.986]  It continues.
[01:27:49.787 --> 01:28:03.690]  I'd have to talk to one of the experts of how this new ruling affects things, but it just shows they don't care what the court rules are coming after our guns, but now the court has finally agreed with them that we don't have a Second Amendment.
[01:28:05.331 --> 01:28:06.031]  Well, we do.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:12.965]  I guess we'll just consider ourselves to have it and know the Constitution's then.
[01:28:13.385 --> 01:28:13.845]  Absolutely.
[01:28:13.865 --> 01:28:14.426]  Thanks, Doris.
[01:28:15.186 --> 01:28:16.447]  And think about this.
[01:28:17.488 --> 01:28:23.473]  This same Supreme Court, you know, the same folks meeting in that building, ruled that women couldn't vote.
[01:28:24.774 --> 01:28:31.399]  That same Supreme Court ruled that black people weren't human beings or were two-thirds human, were subhumans.
[01:28:32.538 --> 01:28:35.059]  Well, finally, blacks didn't go along with it.
[01:28:35.099 --> 01:28:37.199]  They said we're human beings and stood up and fought back.
[01:28:38.239 --> 01:28:39.059]  Same thing with women.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:53.683]  The Supreme Court can rule that the moon is made of cheese, but the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Founding Fathers clearly stated that it doesn't matter what Congress, the executive, or the legislative have to say.
[01:28:54.063 --> 01:29:00.304]  If it's in violation of that Bill of Rights, and if it's in violation of God's laws and the Ten Commandments, we don't have to follow it.
[01:29:01.124 --> 01:29:02.685]  You can go, wait a minute, yes you do.
[01:29:03.126 --> 01:29:07.970]  Oh, so if Hitler was in Germany and passed laws, you had to follow those, huh?
[01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.510]  No, you didn't.
[01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:15.256]  You have every right to stand up against dictatorship, against oligarchy, against autocracy.
[01:29:17.578 --> 01:29:27.286]  And I'm telling you, if the NRA and Shotgun News and others would tell the truth about these rulings and would stop pacifying gun owners, we'd get our Second Amendment back.
[01:29:27.546 --> 01:29:29.848]  We'd be repealing the gun law next year.
[01:29:31.027 --> 01:29:33.969]  The assault weapons ban instead of Bush expanding it.
[01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:36.952]  But the average gun owner doesn't even know about this.
[01:29:37.412 --> 01:29:41.775]  Because Rush Limbaugh and the NRA have done their job of keeping you in the dark.
[01:29:43.917 --> 01:29:44.837]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.318 --> 01:29:46.939]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.542]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.251 --> 01:29:54.632]  We're good to go.

[01:30:31.087 --> 01:30:31.767]  Not convinced yet?

[01:31:20.889 --> 01:31:24.650]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[01:31:41.993 --> 01:31:42.413]  Call today, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:54.368]  Hey, Doris, great news.
[01:31:54.608 --> 01:31:58.852]  I now own my own home, free and clear, and I did it in less than five months.
[01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:00.333]  Did you receive an inheritance?
[01:32:00.493 --> 01:32:00.974]  Well, no.
[01:32:01.134 --> 01:32:05.838]  Actually, I found a way to eliminate my mortgage without bankruptcy and without the need of going to court.
[01:32:05.958 --> 01:32:09.221]  And you, too, can do this legally, lawfully, ethically, and morally.
[01:32:09.301 --> 01:32:11.723]  But, Jim, I signed a note promising to pay back the loan.
[01:32:11.863 --> 01:32:13.865]  Isn't it wrong even if I could discharge the loan?
[01:32:14.105 --> 01:32:18.948]  Doris, I felt the same way until I took the time to learn the truth about money and banking.
[01:32:19.068 --> 01:32:22.951]  The most shocking thing I learned is the fact that no real money is ever loaned out.
[01:32:23.091 --> 01:32:25.773]  There's a dirty secret that the banks don't want you to know.
[01:32:25.953 --> 01:32:29.535]  And this is the basis of how I was able to discharge my own mortgage.
[01:32:29.735 --> 01:32:32.657]  I know this is hard to believe, but go to the website to learn more.
[01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:40.142]  Doris, get your pin and find out how many Americans are finding financial freedom by having their mortgages eliminated in less than five months.
[01:32:40.162 --> 01:32:48.285]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest, a gun on my hip... My friends, what would you do if the federal government passed a law...
[01:33:10.334 --> 01:33:32.203]  That at least one day a week, you had to report to a local community service board, part of the growing Soviet-style neighborhood watch, and that you had to go help dig ditches, help with community projects, pick up trash, pull weeds.
[01:33:33.038 --> 01:33:34.218]  I think we're good to go.
[01:33:34.238 --> 01:33:35.359]  I think we're good to go.
[01:34:02.343 --> 01:34:12.745]  As a tattletale helping police serve warrants, building clearing, assisting at checkpoints, fugitive apprehension, picking up trash, digging ditches.
[01:34:13.306 --> 01:34:24.228]  They have bills and they've started the new draft boards for the universal draft where even older people will have to serve domestically in support roles, kind of like during the Depression.
[01:34:24.978 --> 01:34:31.880]  Where you'd be ordered, if you wanted to eat, that is, if you wanted your, quote, welfare check, well, you're getting welfare.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.141]  You've got to go work for it.
[01:34:33.161 --> 01:34:44.845]  You've got to go work at the local construction site where we're building a road or where we're putting in a dam or cutting down trees or building government housing.
[01:34:46.025 --> 01:34:52.107]  They're gearing up, setting all that up, talking about it in the news, training the children to accept it.
[01:34:54.147 --> 01:34:57.989]  It's the equivalent of a cop coming to your door and saying, come mow my lawn.
[01:34:58.009 --> 01:34:59.589]  You don't have to follow their orders.
[01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:02.390]  But you see, people think, oh, that's not going to happen.
[01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:04.431]  Oh, there's a big terrorist attack.
[01:35:04.952 --> 01:35:06.852]  Well, it's what we've got to do.
[01:35:06.892 --> 01:35:08.533]  We've got to pull for the country.
[01:35:09.153 --> 01:35:10.614]  We're in World War III.
[01:35:10.674 --> 01:35:12.135]  We're in a war with China.
[01:35:12.175 --> 01:35:14.896]  We're in a war with Pakistan.
[01:35:14.936 --> 01:35:16.296]  We're in a war with India.
[01:35:16.336 --> 01:35:17.897]  We're in a war with Syria.
[01:35:18.641 --> 01:35:20.885]  And some are saying, what do you mean a war with Pakistan?
[01:35:20.945 --> 01:35:23.650]  Oh yeah, their government could be replaced overnight, folks.
[01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:25.473]  Same thing with Saudi Arabia.
[01:35:26.615 --> 01:35:31.163]  We have this whole global destabilization, and we need to talk about it.
[01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:32.350]  We're good to go.
[01:35:55.217 --> 01:36:02.719]  And yes, they have not passed Patriot Act 2, but they admit they are implementing it without congressional passage.
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:09.061]  We're about to go to Jacob and Dan and others that are patiently holding.
[01:36:09.101 --> 01:36:11.302]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:36:11.342 --> 01:36:21.305]  I'm going to shoot through these calls real quick, then I'll get into the tyranny that's going on in Iraq that rivals Saddam's abuse.
[01:36:22.186 --> 01:36:23.386]  But before we do that...
[01:36:24.617 --> 01:36:49.006]  I want to encourage everybody who lives in Texas or New Mexico or Louisiana or Arkansas or all over Texas, if you live in South Texas, you have no excuse, a great place to meet like-minded freedom lovers, Christians, libertarians, patriots, people that can see the big picture, that can connect the dots and know what's happening.
[01:36:49.748 --> 01:37:06.198]  Meet hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of like-minded people at the Alamo Drafthouse this Saturday from 6 to midnight at the West Oaks Shopping Center in Western Houston.
[01:37:06.678 --> 01:37:15.283]  We have a map and details and a place to order tickets online at the movie theater website at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:37:16.369 --> 01:37:21.171]  And tomorrow I'll be giving out the address and phone number for folks that need more details.
[01:37:21.231 --> 01:37:26.812]  But 6 o'clock, Houston, Texas, this Saturday, West Oak Shopping Center.
[01:37:27.753 --> 01:37:28.493]  Can't miss it.
[01:37:28.993 --> 01:37:29.693]  I'll be there.
[01:37:29.753 --> 01:37:31.094]  I'm going to give a 30-minute speech.
[01:37:31.114 --> 01:37:33.254]  Then we're going to show Road to Tyranny one more time.
[01:37:33.654 --> 01:37:35.335]  Last time it was an overflow crowd.
[01:37:35.995 --> 01:37:38.696]  Then I'm going to show John Carpenter's They Live.
[01:37:39.665 --> 01:37:43.226]  To give folks an analogy on the big picture, it's a great film.
[01:37:43.266 --> 01:37:43.886]  You need to see it.
[01:37:44.386 --> 01:37:48.028]  And it's a great place, as I said, to meet other like-minded freedom lovers in the network.
[01:37:48.568 --> 01:37:52.489]  And, of course, I'll be there with the videos and the books at the table as well.
[01:37:52.549 --> 01:37:54.389]  So please come to the event.
[01:37:54.429 --> 01:37:54.529]  It's $10.
[01:37:54.649 --> 01:37:58.051]  And, of course, most of that goes to the theater, who are great folks.
[01:37:58.511 --> 01:38:01.972]  But the other portion goes to support the broadcast and what we're doing.
[01:38:03.212 --> 01:38:06.313]  Road to Tyranny and They Lived.
[01:38:07.193 --> 01:38:10.415]  So please come out and see the event.
[01:38:11.176 --> 01:38:18.060]  And that is going to be this Saturday, the 13th of December 2003 in Houston, Texas.
[01:38:18.801 --> 01:38:23.423]  Also, I've made 10 films.
[01:38:24.484 --> 01:38:36.672]  And if you live in Rhode Island or Los Angeles or if you're in Kansas City, wherever you're at, if you want a tool that will wake up your friends and family,
[01:38:37.538 --> 01:38:43.520]  That has a great track record of unlocking minds and showing people the big picture and connecting those dots.
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:49.082]  You need to get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, about September 11th and what really happened there in the Globalist Master Plan.
[01:38:49.342 --> 01:38:51.683]  You need to get part two of that, Masters of Terror.
[01:38:52.834 --> 01:38:55.377]  Again, expanding on 9-11, part two of that.
[01:38:55.718 --> 01:38:59.643]  You need to get Police State 3, Total Enslavement, my third Police State film.
[01:38:59.663 --> 01:39:01.245]  I haven't made one in three years.
[01:39:01.545 --> 01:39:04.869]  We cover a lot of what's happened in the last three years in this new film.
[01:39:05.110 --> 01:39:11.438]  What the New World Order is, what neocons are, how the left and right is controlled, government-run white slavery rings.
[01:39:11.978 --> 01:39:20.325]  The Cashless Society Control Grid, other examples of government-sponsored terror, Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, it's all in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:39:20.565 --> 01:39:28.751]  My new film, Matrix of Evil, is now out with Ron Paul and Cynthia McKinney and Frank Morales, Colonel Roberts, myself.
[01:39:29.512 --> 01:39:30.313]  Great new film.
[01:39:30.333 --> 01:39:31.774]  They're all over two hours.
[01:39:31.814 --> 01:39:33.095]  Some are two hours and five minutes.
[01:39:33.435 --> 01:39:39.860]  Some of the films are two hours and 40 minutes, like Road to Tyranny or Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.242]  You need to have these videos.
[01:39:43.282 --> 01:39:44.444]  They're so well done.
[01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:46.727]  I want you to get them.
[01:39:46.787 --> 01:39:55.938]  I want you to make copies of them and give them to your friends, your family, your pastor, your local talk show host, your sheriff, because we're unlocking minds one mind at a time.
[01:39:56.636 --> 01:40:07.160]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or to get my book or Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, or the new video by Eric Hufschmidt, Painful Questions, about 9-11.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:14.063]  This is important stuff, the best stuff I've found out there that I've seen, that I've read, my own work, others' work.
[01:40:14.083 --> 01:40:17.564]  We have it all available, and your purchase makes this show possible.
[01:40:17.604 --> 01:40:19.325]  So again, here's the toll-free number.
[01:40:20.477 --> 01:40:20.577]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:40:20.617 --> 01:40:20.978]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:40:21.098 --> 01:40:27.001]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:40:48.311 --> 01:40:52.753]  Again, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:40:53.873 --> 01:40:59.736]  Or call toll-free 1-888-2533-139.
[01:41:00.156 --> 01:41:03.257]  And if you order this week, we'll be able to get it out to you by Christmas.
[01:41:04.398 --> 01:41:06.338]  Average time is about seven days.
[01:41:06.378 --> 01:41:07.779]  We ship, you know, normal U.S.
[01:41:07.839 --> 01:41:08.179]  mail.
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:10.680]  But sometimes it takes two weeks.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.082]  So get the order in this week so you get it in time to give it as a gift.
[01:41:15.874 --> 01:41:18.315]  And again, get the videos, make copies, give them as gifts.
[01:41:18.735 --> 01:41:20.496]  That's my goal, is to reach people.
[01:41:20.896 --> 01:41:22.317]  Air them on AXS TV.
[01:41:22.837 --> 01:41:24.758]  This is such a big part of what we do.
[01:41:24.818 --> 01:41:28.640]  It's the most powerful tool I have in waking people up.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:33.122]  And we don't have that power unless you get the videos and pay it forward.
[01:41:33.382 --> 01:41:35.463]  That is, make the copies and spread the word.
[01:41:36.143 --> 01:41:41.406]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Jacob in Oklahoma, who's been holding patiently.
[01:41:41.446 --> 01:41:42.226]  Thank you, Jacob.
[01:41:43.396 --> 01:41:44.336]  Good to talk to you.
[01:41:44.376 --> 01:41:46.357]  I appreciate the chance to talk to you, Alex.
[01:41:46.477 --> 01:41:47.157]  Good to talk to you.
[01:41:47.197 --> 01:41:47.557]  Go ahead.
[01:41:49.437 --> 01:41:58.940]  I don't think we need to get too excited because, well, the sheriff made me a visit over a gun issue.
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:00.960]  He brought the ATF with him.
[01:42:03.081 --> 01:42:06.922]  But, well, he just came up and knocked on the door.
[01:42:07.002 --> 01:42:09.862]  He said, I want to talk to you.
[01:42:09.882 --> 01:42:13.003]  So I opened the door and let him in.
[01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:22.596]  And the gist of it was they'd been listening to that Echelon, you know, that DEA guy.
[01:42:22.616 --> 01:42:27.661]  He'd come down in the county and get the sheriff to come out and see me.
[01:42:27.681 --> 01:42:35.689]  And I told that young DEA, I said, I'll tell you what, I said, you be quiet and pay attention a while.
[01:42:35.729 --> 01:42:37.971]  When you figure out what's going on, then you join in.
[01:42:39.875 --> 01:42:40.896]  Now, let me get this straight.
[01:42:40.916 --> 01:42:54.184]  You're saying we shouldn't get too excited about Bush saying he's going to reauthorize the assault weapons ban, adding, depending on how you interpret it, 60 to 100-plus ban types of guns on top of the others that have been restricted there.
[01:42:54.204 --> 01:43:06.111]  We've got the Supreme Court saying they agree there's no Second Amendment in a major ruling, and you get a visit by gun grabbers who've been spying on you and you're not upset.
[01:43:07.403 --> 01:43:10.565]  Yeah, but you see, we got rid of that sheriff next election.
[01:43:11.566 --> 01:43:16.769]  But they can pass all the laws they want to in Washington, but it only applies to federal property.
[01:43:17.406 --> 01:43:18.247]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:43:18.287 --> 01:43:18.907]  I agree with you.
[01:43:18.967 --> 01:43:19.808]  Very well said.
[01:43:19.948 --> 01:43:22.130]  The local fight is where it's all at right now.
[01:43:22.450 --> 01:43:26.373]  They've got the stronghold of Washington, but that's their base.
[01:43:26.674 --> 01:43:29.676]  They're racing to put in the touchscreen electronic voting.
[01:43:30.016 --> 01:43:36.041]  Admittedly, mainstream news run by the CIA, stealing every major election.
[01:43:36.161 --> 01:43:40.925]  All the big companies have been caught doing it, and they're racing to put in the touchscreens.
[01:43:41.286 --> 01:43:45.209]  You better stop them now, wherever you're listening, folks.
[01:43:46.437 --> 01:43:49.059]  Well, you know why they call the Klan the Invisible Empire?
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:51.120]  Why's that?
[01:43:52.201 --> 01:43:55.002]  Because you don't ever see the ones that count.
[01:43:56.924 --> 01:43:59.265]  Like me and the rest of the guys around here.
[01:44:00.066 --> 01:44:01.507]  So you're in the Ku Klux Klan?
[01:44:01.887 --> 01:44:06.130]  Well, I mean, nobody knows it but me and the neighbor.
[01:44:07.711 --> 01:44:11.213]  And you think that the Ku Klux Klan is going to stop the government?
[01:44:11.753 --> 01:44:12.894]  Well, it stopped it here.
[01:44:14.673 --> 01:44:20.357]  The thing is about it, see, everybody belongs to the plan.
[01:44:20.717 --> 01:44:26.362]  As soon as they challenge their righteous indignation, they get up on their horse and they ride.
[01:44:26.382 --> 01:44:29.744]  And that's what's going to happen.
[01:44:32.006 --> 01:44:34.267]  Okay, thanks for the call, Jacob.
[01:44:37.150 --> 01:44:40.532]  I'm not against black people or Hispanics or any other race.
[01:44:40.992 --> 01:44:46.756]  I am disgusted by the Black Panthers, the new leader, Khalid Muhammad, who says kill all white people.
[01:44:47.977 --> 01:44:53.060]  And I've got him on video, folks, in a debate with Anthony Hiller saying we want to kill every white child, every white woman.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:58.983]  I've got him on video marching in Houston saying the same thing with loaded shotguns, which is their right to do.
[01:44:59.044 --> 01:45:01.225]  They guarantee to arrest a bunch of white people doing that.
[01:45:03.929 --> 01:45:08.310]  And then whites see the racist blacks, and then they go join the race groups.
[01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:14.772]  And the Mexicans and Hispanics see the racist whites, and they go and join the racist Mecha and La Raza.
[01:45:15.452 --> 01:45:17.233]  And this is exactly what the government wants.
[01:45:17.393 --> 01:45:30.616]  Now, going back to the beginning of the Klan, after the Civil War, during Reconstruction, I had ancestors who were in the Civil War.
[01:45:31.562 --> 01:45:43.869]  And when the northern troops came in and raped and killed a bunch of people and burned down hotels and slaughtered everybody, it started by camouflaging the horse, because if somebody could see what your horse looked like, they could come out and kill you later.
[01:45:44.309 --> 01:45:48.211]  That's how it all started, putting camouflage sheets over your horse.
[01:45:50.392 --> 01:45:54.315]  Because you can say, oh, that was the horse that was there, that Palomino or whatever.
[01:45:54.935 --> 01:45:56.296]  And that's how it all began.
[01:45:56.536 --> 01:46:00.338]  And groups of Texans removed two governors at gunpoint
[01:46:01.279 --> 01:46:04.100]  From downtown Austin in the 1770s.
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:07.240]  In the 1870s, excuse me.
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:11.101]  And so there's that whole history.
[01:46:11.341 --> 01:46:19.202]  But when you talk about the Klan of the last hundred years, it's a Masonic organization, number one.
[01:46:19.842 --> 01:46:24.583]  Albert Pike, the big Confederate general, one of the founders of it, and all of this.
[01:46:24.903 --> 01:46:28.944]  And I've gone out and protested the Ku Klux Klan in Waco, Texas.
[01:46:30.594 --> 01:46:33.996]  And every time I investigate them, they're run by feds.
[01:46:34.016 --> 01:46:42.981]  In fact, it's the old joke of somebody goes to a Klan rally or a white supremacist rally, and it'll end up where it's only feds there.
[01:46:43.001 --> 01:46:44.042]  I mean, that's actually happened.
[01:46:44.682 --> 01:46:51.847]  They had the BATF, the FBI, and the DEA and others were caught at that good old boy roundup in 1992 in Alabama.
[01:46:55.310 --> 01:47:02.091]  Where they were burning effigies of black people, selling the black person hunting licenses, and the rest of it.
[01:47:04.592 --> 01:47:19.415]  I have no doubt that good old boy groups in towns, secret societies like the Klan, even a blind hog finds an acorn occasionally, have blocked federal intrusion.
[01:47:19.775 --> 01:47:21.055]  Because that's the roots of it.
[01:47:23.246 --> 01:47:26.548]  But I don't agree with the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:47:26.568 --> 01:47:28.510]  I have to say that here on the air.
[01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:39.938]  Any more than I agree with the racist Mecha or La Raza or the Black Panthers or any of it, or Mr. Farrakhan, who says white people are the devil.
[01:47:39.998 --> 01:47:41.879]  He's kind of softened that in the past.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:48.304]  You know, I've had black people call me a blue-eyed devil and make comments when I was growing up in Dallas and
[01:47:48.974 --> 01:47:54.556]  And I've had blacks attack me, but I'm not going to hate all black people because I've been attacked by blacks.
[01:47:55.617 --> 01:48:02.799]  But I will stand up and speak out against racist blacks or racist whites because let me tell you something, all it does is add to this whole thing.
[01:48:03.079 --> 01:48:08.922]  We're not going to win this fight unless we get everybody together against the main target, the New World Order.
[01:48:08.982 --> 01:48:10.022]  We're all under attack.
[01:48:11.983 --> 01:48:24.086]  And I know when I go to a rally to fight the Patriot Act or to fight for somebody's land or to stand up for the Second Amendment, there are Hispanics there, there are black folks there, and they care about freedom, and we should not exclude them.
[01:48:24.366 --> 01:48:25.606]  And they shouldn't exclude us.
[01:48:28.027 --> 01:48:29.387]  I'm against multiculturalism.
[01:48:29.407 --> 01:48:30.868]  That's destroying all our cultures.
[01:48:31.888 --> 01:48:35.769]  I'm against the racism of any of these groups.
[01:48:35.829 --> 01:48:40.110]  I think we should be able to speak out against the racism of the Zionists, and a lot of Jews are doing that.
[01:48:42.392 --> 01:48:44.372]  But tribalism feels really good.
[01:48:45.633 --> 01:48:46.713]  Primitive tribalism.
[01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:48.173]  Racism's an invented word.
[01:48:48.213 --> 01:48:49.153]  It's all tribalism.
[01:48:49.473 --> 01:48:50.133]  It's in us.
[01:48:50.713 --> 01:48:53.174]  In Africa, one black tribe hates the next black tribe.
[01:48:53.214 --> 01:48:55.614]  In Ireland, it's Protestant against Catholic.
[01:48:56.895 --> 01:48:57.955]  It's North against South.
[01:48:58.015 --> 01:49:00.715]  We've got to get past that to focusing on the New World Order.
[01:49:01.755 --> 01:49:03.996]  Let's talk to Dan in Illinois, then Eric in Connecticut.
[01:49:04.056 --> 01:49:04.876]  Dan, you're on the air.
[01:49:04.896 --> 01:49:05.316]  Go ahead.
[01:49:06.556 --> 01:49:07.556]  Welcome.
[01:49:08.417 --> 01:49:10.537]  You may disagree with me or what on this, but
[01:49:11.178 --> 01:49:27.306]  I really believe the state that we're in today, where we're losing our freedoms, goes right back to the beginning when this all started, when self-righteous, fearful groups started pressuring the government to start interfering with the way adults behave.
[01:49:28.567 --> 01:49:34.370]  And as soon as they started doing that, that's the steamroll to where we're at today, where the government's going to tell us what to eat or not to eat.
[01:49:35.131 --> 01:49:37.712]  Well, that's it, and it's all going to be selectively enforced.
[01:49:39.045 --> 01:49:41.066]  All of this is to be selectively enforced.
[01:49:41.506 --> 01:49:47.669]  Right, but I mean, you go back to, you know, you just look at an old Wild West movie or something like that, and a guy could carry a gun, right?
[01:49:48.809 --> 01:49:51.591]  Where did this, I don't think the government on its own got this idea.
[01:49:51.611 --> 01:49:52.771]  Well, forget the Wild West.
[01:49:52.851 --> 01:49:59.254]  My father in a pretty big school would carry a shotgun or his deer rifle to school, walk in with it loaded, and put it in his locker.
[01:49:59.514 --> 01:50:07.718]  Right, but was it the government that stopped doing this, or was it pressures from people, fearful people who didn't,
[01:50:08.779 --> 01:50:10.700]  Well, it's more... No, it's a feedback loop.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:17.141]  The government plays on the pressures, funds the useful idiot groups that create the illusion that the people want all this.
[01:50:18.081 --> 01:50:20.602]  That's now, but I think from the beginning it wasn't that way.
[01:50:21.122 --> 01:50:23.142]  Well, a lot of it was people moving into cities.
[01:50:23.183 --> 01:50:24.543]  We lost touch with reality.
[01:50:25.163 --> 01:50:25.343]  Right.
[01:50:25.603 --> 01:50:28.164]  Living out in the country has a way of getting you back to reality.
[01:50:29.424 --> 01:50:32.105]  But there's this other thing... Stay there.
[01:50:32.285 --> 01:50:32.885]  Stay there, Dan.
[01:50:33.265 --> 01:50:34.005]  Then Eric and others.
[01:50:34.605 --> 01:50:35.365]  Third hour's coming up.
[01:50:35.385 --> 01:50:37.846]  I'm going to get more into the Second Amendment news and this Iraq news and...
[01:50:38.556 --> 01:50:39.276]  There's a lot of it.
[01:50:39.376 --> 01:50:40.837]  We've gone through about half the stack.
[01:50:40.917 --> 01:50:41.777]  I haven't even begun.
[01:50:42.317 --> 01:50:46.399]  Prisonplanet.com, Infowars.com are the websites.
[01:50:47.779 --> 01:50:48.440]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:48.860]  Stay with us.
[01:50:53.942 --> 01:50:56.122]  This is Michael Corbin, host of A Closer Look.
[01:50:56.663 --> 01:50:58.663]  Now you can hear more of a good thing.
[01:50:59.103 --> 01:51:03.145]  Beginning Monday, November 17th, we are expanding our daily program to two hours.
[01:51:03.615 --> 01:51:04.155]  We're good to go.
[01:51:24.119 --> 01:51:27.520]  A closer look puts you in the driver's seat by keeping you informed.
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:38.362]  Our program, combined with other programs on this network, such as Alex Jones, strives to present a united front on the war against corruption being perpetrated by our politicians.
[01:51:38.882 --> 01:51:42.983]  We provide you the means to halt their assault so we can take our country back.
[01:51:43.583 --> 01:51:45.843]  So join me Monday through Saturday, 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:51:45.883 --> 01:51:49.924]  Mountain, 8 to 10 Eastern, right here on the Genesis Communications Network.
[01:51:50.384 --> 01:51:50.764]  Be there.
[01:51:53.996 --> 01:51:58.339]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:51:58.519 --> 01:52:02.942]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:03.102 --> 01:52:07.485]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:52:07.505 --> 01:52:08.846]  The New World Order.
[01:52:09.626 --> 01:52:10.627]  Can emerge.
[01:52:10.647 --> 01:52:14.872]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:52:14.932 --> 01:52:21.880]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.003]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:24.383 --> 01:52:34.709]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:52:34.989 --> 01:52:40.352]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:52:40.873 --> 01:52:43.494]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[01:52:53.647 --> 01:53:04.372]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:53:04.552 --> 01:53:12.136]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:53:12.356 --> 01:53:13.157]  We're good to go.
[01:53:28.334 --> 01:53:32.235]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:53:32.275 --> 01:53:34.196]  The water level is always visible.
[01:53:34.356 --> 01:53:40.298]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:53:40.538 --> 01:53:44.240]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:44.760]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:02.882]  You know, I might as well tell this story now.
[01:54:04.223 --> 01:54:07.586]  We'll go back to Dan, Eric, John, Howard, Ralph, and many others.
[01:54:10.388 --> 01:54:20.236]  When I was a teenager, I had, I mean, so it was a lot rougher in Dallas, and I'd gotten in some fights, and, you know, I'd hurt a couple people pretty bad.
[01:54:20.396 --> 01:54:21.577]  I hadn't been indicted.
[01:54:22.888 --> 01:54:27.111]  Because they would go to the witnesses and find out that I had been attacked and I would just fight back.
[01:54:27.291 --> 01:54:32.115]  But my dad didn't like the way things were going, so a couple summers he sent me down to my grandma's.
[01:54:32.135 --> 01:54:36.297]  In fact, he already had just to learn ranching and also work for a large animal vet.
[01:54:38.039 --> 01:54:40.800]  And I was sent down to where my family lives.
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:45.604]  They live really closer to Buffalo in East Texas than they do to Fairfield, Texas.
[01:54:46.725 --> 01:54:50.227]  But I was sent for a couple months until I couldn't stand it.
[01:54:50.828 --> 01:54:52.550]  To school in Teague, Texas.
[01:54:52.730 --> 01:54:56.413]  I actually spent a few months of high school going to school in Teague, Texas.
[01:54:57.935 --> 01:55:02.779]  And I was on the football team.
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:06.683]  And this was the last draw, last day of school I went there.
[01:55:08.805 --> 01:55:10.847]  And it was the bonfire.
[01:55:12.749 --> 01:55:14.451]  I guess for what, like the second football game.
[01:55:14.471 --> 01:55:15.972]  They had this huge bonfire.
[01:55:17.322 --> 01:55:20.265]  And this is a big school, folks.
[01:55:20.465 --> 01:55:23.508]  I think it was like thousands of students.
[01:55:24.929 --> 01:55:25.510]  Nice school.
[01:55:26.551 --> 01:55:30.634]  And everybody's all acting weird out there, and there's some black kids there, and they go, I'm getting out of here.
[01:55:30.654 --> 01:55:31.695]  I'm not going to stay here for this.
[01:55:31.735 --> 01:55:32.676]  And they all run off.
[01:55:33.196 --> 01:55:42.425]  And all of a sudden, in the middle of the fire, they pull a rope, and a big old cross gets hauled up in the middle of the fire, and there's these hundreds and hundreds of people out there
[01:55:44.055 --> 01:55:47.336]  All basically, you talk about the invisible empire.
[01:55:47.456 --> 01:55:49.577]  Yes, folks, invisible empire.
[01:55:51.638 --> 01:55:57.179]  And I was sitting there with my mouth hanging open watching this.
[01:55:57.199 --> 01:56:02.781]  And when I went home and told my dad about it back in Dallas, he said, oh, yeah, when I was a child, we used to go swimming.
[01:56:03.599 --> 01:56:13.258]  At the Teague Public Pool, because that's closer to where my family lives in Fairfield, though my grandfather was involved in the county government there in Freestone County.
[01:56:14.966 --> 01:56:15.586]  We're good to go.
[01:56:44.102 --> 01:56:44.462]  I think.
[01:56:44.482 --> 01:56:45.023]  I think.
[01:57:07.316 --> 01:57:18.790]  But again, you've got a lot of people there who I would later ask around who aren't even from Teague, Texas, but they come in, they show up, they start the Klan, they run around and use it for their own political control.
[01:57:19.443 --> 01:57:23.766]  So that's my experience, my only experience, with the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:57:24.667 --> 01:57:26.268]  And yes, it is an invisible empire.
[01:57:26.388 --> 01:57:27.609]  It is all over the place.
[01:57:28.129 --> 01:57:29.570]  It is tens of millions of people.
[01:57:30.090 --> 01:57:38.276]  I will tell you right now, the toothless people you see on TV are not the real Ku Klux Klan.
[01:57:39.217 --> 01:57:43.620]  And let me tell you, the Ku Klux Klan at the county level is involved in drug dealing.
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:45.781]  It's involved in corruption, graft.
[01:57:45.841 --> 01:57:48.643]  It's a good old boy, masonic network.
[01:57:49.344 --> 01:57:55.510]  I'm not saying that every person who's in it is pure evil, but you are certainly misguided.
[01:57:55.810 --> 01:57:58.353]  Just like everybody in Mecha or La Raza isn't evil.
[01:57:59.314 --> 01:58:01.416]  Hispanic racist groups, you're just misguided.
[01:58:01.836 --> 01:58:05.840]  And it's tribalism, and it feels good, and I can understand that.
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:11.305]  But you better wake up and come to the realization that we've all got to come together to defeat this new world order.
[01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:15.010]  Alright, so I've now told you that bizarre story.
[01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:16.771]  We'll be back with the third hour.
[01:58:16.831 --> 01:58:20.833]  I promise I'll go right back to Dan and Eric and John and Howard and Ralph.
[01:58:20.853 --> 01:58:21.753]  Everybody stay there.
[01:58:23.294 --> 01:58:27.216]  Bunch of other key news and analysis for you in the third hour.
[01:58:28.456 --> 01:58:29.457]  So please stay with us.
[01:58:30.697 --> 01:58:38.981]  And the websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com We'll be right back.
[01:58:44.082 --> 01:58:47.563]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:58:47.844 --> 01:58:51.345]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:58:51.425 --> 01:58:55.367]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:58:55.587 --> 01:59:01.749]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:02.170 --> 01:59:10.073]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:59:10.473 --> 01:59:15.836]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:59:15.976 --> 01:59:19.758]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:59:20.119 --> 01:59:21.980]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:24.201]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:59:24.441 --> 01:59:29.704]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:59:29.744 --> 01:59:35.187]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:59:39.730 --> 01:59:41.331]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:59:41.391 --> 01:59:42.211]  Protect your family.
[01:59:50.396 --> 01:59:51.036]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.697 --> 01:59:52.737]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.478 --> 01:59:54.618]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.638 --> 01:59:56.079]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.799 --> 01:59:57.720]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:02.102]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.543 --> 02:00:06.605]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.923 --> 02:00:14.467]  All right, my friends, already 30 seconds into this third hour.
[02:00:15.248 --> 02:00:19.251]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we're going to be live here for another hour.
[02:00:19.371 --> 02:00:22.253]  I know we have loaded phone lines and so much news.
[02:00:22.834 --> 02:00:27.917]  I want to get into Bush's anti-gun activities for neocons out there that are ignorant on this fact.
[02:00:28.398 --> 02:00:29.899]  Also, tough new tactics.
[02:00:30.623 --> 02:00:31.064]  We're good to go.
[02:00:31.084 --> 02:00:31.945]  We're good to go.
[02:00:52.124 --> 02:00:53.966]  So that is coming up as well.
[02:00:54.527 --> 02:00:56.329]  Right now, let's get back to the calls.
[02:00:56.529 --> 02:01:01.013]  Dan in Illinois, you were trying to make another point when we hit the last break.
[02:01:01.053 --> 02:01:01.474]  Go ahead.
[02:01:01.674 --> 02:01:03.095]  Just two real quick things, Alex.
[02:01:03.656 --> 02:01:15.648]  One is that once the government, the people in charge, got a taste of the power, like a drug, they've been plotting and scheming ever since how to get more and more to how to control people as adults, meaning like children.
[02:01:16.457 --> 02:01:22.423]  To the point where anyone who's got guns now are treated like as rebellious children because they're not going to be able to control them so easily.
[02:01:23.524 --> 02:01:26.147]  And it's all in our best interest, all to take care of us.
[02:01:26.167 --> 02:01:29.750]  The government cares so much about us, but really it's about controlling the cattle.
[02:01:30.011 --> 02:01:30.431]  That's right.
[02:01:30.751 --> 02:01:36.057]  And now the other thing I was going to say is that a lot of times, you know, people reap what they sow as far as that's concerned.
[02:01:36.617 --> 02:01:40.261]  You know, Bush-loving Dr. Dobson, in his newsletter one time I read,
[02:01:41.081 --> 02:01:46.301]  Is that he helped pass the ordinance in Colorado Springs that if you swear, you'd be put in jail.
[02:01:48.396 --> 02:01:51.457]  So now people use the word Christian, they're going to be put in jail.
[02:01:51.517 --> 02:01:53.437]  I mean, that's how crazy it is.
[02:01:53.477 --> 02:01:55.278]  That's the type of stuff I'm talking about.
[02:01:55.358 --> 02:01:56.138]  Well, no, I agree.
[02:01:56.198 --> 02:02:05.040]  I mean, I don't agree with drugs, but the criminalization of them energizes the criminals, creates 9 out of 10 crimes, and there's more drugs on the streets than ever before.
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:06.200]  And it creates animosity.
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:06.920]  You know what I mean?
[02:02:06.940 --> 02:02:08.601]  Because there's this restriction going on.
[02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:10.201]  There's two different sides at all times.
[02:02:10.601 --> 02:02:10.941]  It does.
[02:02:11.001 --> 02:02:11.601]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:11.621 --> 02:02:11.902]  Take care.
[02:02:12.502 --> 02:02:13.242]  I appreciate it.
[02:02:13.622 --> 02:02:15.882]  Eric in Connecticut, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:02:16.923 --> 02:02:17.343]  Hey, Alex.
[02:02:17.623 --> 02:02:18.043]  Hello, sir.
[02:02:19.636 --> 02:02:20.637]  I have something to tell you.
[02:02:20.917 --> 02:02:25.681]  I actually have been in the Masonic Fraternity for nigh close to 20 years now.
[02:02:26.741 --> 02:02:28.143]  And I've been a fairly active member.
[02:02:28.503 --> 02:02:36.869]  And not too long ago I asked God, and this is no lie, I asked God to put me in the way of knowledge that I had been previously ignorant to.
[02:02:37.670 --> 02:02:46.157]  And this was shortly before I discovered you and discovered a lot of other information on the Internet and elsewhere about September 11th, Pearl Harbor, and many, many other things.
[02:02:46.724 --> 02:02:50.767]  And I have to be honest with you, Alex, I'm really starting to question my Masonic affiliation.
[02:02:51.167 --> 02:03:01.374]  I'm really starting to question, does this organization put on a very friendly front that talks about brotherly love, relief, and truth?
[02:03:01.434 --> 02:03:16.025]  Where behind the scenes, though, there's a real dark series of actions going on to basically create this new world order, to create all this chaos and mayhem, and to advance Satan's cause.
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:19.601]  What degree are you?
[02:03:19.821 --> 02:03:21.082]  Well, I made Master Mason.
[02:03:22.343 --> 02:03:25.926]  Actually, I was raised in 87.
[02:03:26.606 --> 02:03:28.087]  March of 87, I was raised.
[02:03:29.588 --> 02:03:31.390]  And like I said, I've been fairly active.
[02:03:31.630 --> 02:03:35.313]  I was sort of in the chairs, and I sat in the East and all this kind of thing.
[02:03:35.593 --> 02:03:41.017]  And I've initiated candidates and the whole thing.
[02:03:41.037 --> 02:03:44.960]  And like I said, I'm reading this book, Bloodlines of the Illuminati.
[02:03:46.151 --> 02:03:49.975]  I've done some studying on it, and I have to really start to question.
[02:03:49.995 --> 02:03:52.058]  You know, I look at these bloodlines.
[02:03:52.118 --> 02:03:55.962]  I look at the Illuminati script of World War II.
[02:03:56.002 --> 02:03:57.844]  World War II followed an Illuminati script.
[02:03:58.144 --> 02:04:00.927]  Well, you're sitting in the... Yeah, Albert Pike, run about it.
[02:04:01.687 --> 02:04:06.668]  In the 1770s, your big Grand Mason founded the Klan and all the rest of it.
[02:04:07.829 --> 02:04:13.630]  Pike, you're sitting in the command base of the Masons up in Connecticut.
[02:04:13.850 --> 02:04:14.370]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:15.550]  It's not really D.C.
[02:04:15.850 --> 02:04:17.391]  I'll tell you what, stay there, Eric.
[02:04:17.451 --> 02:04:22.212]  We'll talk more about the Masons and what they really are when we get back after this break.
[02:04:22.839 --> 02:04:26.563]  Then we'll go to Howard and Ralph and others.
[02:04:26.983 --> 02:04:29.465]  Toll free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:29.686 --> 02:04:37.032]  We'll get to more of your calls and into more of this news after this quick break.
[02:04:37.533 --> 02:04:40.616]  This should be an interesting discussion with Eric, so don't hang up, Eric.
[02:04:41.076 --> 02:04:41.757]  Stay right there.
[02:04:41.797 --> 02:04:43.899]  We'll be back to you after this break.
[02:04:46.047 --> 02:04:52.913]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:04:53.214 --> 02:04:54.575]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:04:54.775 --> 02:04:56.977]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:04:57.137 --> 02:04:59.219]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:04:59.499 --> 02:05:04.424]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:05:04.764 --> 02:05:08.808]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:05:09.048 --> 02:05:09.869]  We're good to go.
[02:05:09.929 --> 02:05:11.029]  We're good to go.
[02:05:32.762 --> 02:05:36.464]  That's 888-253-3139 or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[02:05:36.544 --> 02:05:37.445]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:05:37.465 --> 02:05:40.466]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[02:05:49.642 --> 02:05:49.982]  Yes.
[02:05:50.262 --> 02:05:55.065]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[02:05:55.185 --> 02:06:04.111]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[02:06:04.251 --> 02:06:11.975]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.

[02:06:39.115 --> 02:06:42.417]  And thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[02:06:46.175 --> 02:06:50.677]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:06:51.037 --> 02:06:55.118]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:06:55.398 --> 02:06:55.958]  We listened.
[02:06:56.258 --> 02:07:01.240]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:02.000]  We listened.
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:05.441]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:07:05.842 --> 02:07:06.402]  We listened.
[02:07:06.862 --> 02:07:09.923]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:07:09.923 --> 02:07:10.543]  We're good to go.
[02:07:41.687 --> 02:07:51.151]  Big Brother.
[02:07:51.791 --> 02:07:52.851]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:53.571 --> 02:07:54.692]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:55.312 --> 02:07:56.152]  You want answers?
[02:07:56.913 --> 02:07:57.853]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:58.473 --> 02:08:02.215]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.635 --> 02:08:04.996]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[02:08:05.882 --> 02:08:06.763]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:09.525 --> 02:08:17.991]  Coming up, my friends, more on the Supreme Court saying, hey, we're not going to hear the case out of the big federal court in San Francisco where they say that they can ban any gun they want.
[02:08:18.011 --> 02:08:24.236]  Now that the Supreme Court has agreed with that, that's what they've done, that will have national implications.
[02:08:25.277 --> 02:08:30.141]  More on that, more about the real abuse of the Iraqi people going on in Iraq by our troops.
[02:08:31.922 --> 02:08:34.584]  But they have to do this in preparation for sending in the U.N.
[02:08:34.644 --> 02:08:35.485]  as the saviors
[02:08:36.187 --> 02:08:39.049]  Newt Gingrich says we've gone off the edge of the cliff in Iraq.
[02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:42.390]  It's all coming up and more.
[02:08:42.931 --> 02:08:44.371]  And, of course, we've got loaded phone lines.
[02:08:45.032 --> 02:08:48.154]  Eric in Connecticut says that he's a master mason.
[02:08:48.174 --> 02:08:50.275]  I guess by that he would mean a 32nd degree.
[02:08:52.476 --> 02:08:59.880]  And he says that in the last period of time since he discovered this show or asked God to show him the truth that he found this show and
[02:09:00.467 --> 02:09:03.509]  He's been researching the New World Order, and he asks questions.
[02:09:03.529 --> 02:09:06.150]  But let me boil down just a nutshell what the Masons are.
[02:09:08.512 --> 02:09:13.855]  Back in the time of Solomon's Temple, even before that, in Egypt, they had secret construction guilds.
[02:09:14.395 --> 02:09:18.977]  The mathematics was one of the most powerful things, most valuable things on Earth.
[02:09:19.558 --> 02:09:21.579]  Construction secrets were power.
[02:09:22.199 --> 02:09:25.261]  And they didn't just have public schools to teach construction.
[02:09:27.014 --> 02:09:37.841]  So they formed secret societies, secret rights, to make sure that they were not giving building secrets or mathematics secrets to anyone but a part of the union.
[02:09:37.902 --> 02:09:45.887]  It was a union, just like a steel workers' union or an education union or a plumbers' union, whatever today.
[02:09:47.168 --> 02:09:54.533]  And of course, because it was ancient, it had a lot of Babylon mystery religion trappings because it came out of antiquity.
[02:09:55.638 --> 02:09:58.820]  And any type of science had religion wrapped around it.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:04.724]  It's like astrology grew into the real science of astronomy.
[02:10:05.485 --> 02:10:09.387]  But all of our scientists began in what you'd call alchemy.
[02:10:09.427 --> 02:10:13.350]  They would attach religious significance to any type of reaction.
[02:10:14.984 --> 02:10:26.271]  And over time it picked up more and more of history, more and more secrets, and the Masonic system from time to time gets infiltrated at the top and controlled by different groups of people.
[02:10:27.452 --> 02:10:41.083]  The Masons will argue that, well, George Washington was a Mason, and Sam Houston in Texas was a Mason, the Lone Star State, and the obelisks are all Masonic Egyptian symbols, and the secrets are the secrets of Solomon's Temple.
[02:10:41.703 --> 02:10:43.225]  This is what the Masons are into.
[02:10:43.285 --> 02:10:47.428]  Texas is one of the strongest Masonic states other than Connecticut in the Union.
[02:10:48.889 --> 02:10:53.713]  And almost all of those that died at the Alamo were Masons, and they meant well.
[02:10:54.938 --> 02:10:56.119]  They were mid-level Masons.
[02:10:56.139 --> 02:10:57.200]  They weren't at the higher levels.
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:02.504]  George Washington wrote letters near the end of his life warning about the Illuminati Masons that were taking over.
[02:11:03.205 --> 02:11:12.432]  Any secret society, any good old boy network, is perfect for what we'd call intelligence agencies today to take them over.
[02:11:14.614 --> 02:11:16.816]  And that's exactly what's happened.
[02:11:17.677 --> 02:11:20.659]  And it's compartmentalized like the CIA.
[02:11:20.679 --> 02:11:22.681]  In fact, the CIA is mainly Masons.
[02:11:24.139 --> 02:11:25.380]  Because it's tailor-made for it.
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:32.443]  And it's compartmentalized, with 99% having no idea what the ultimate secrets are.
[02:11:32.523 --> 02:11:35.964]  But Albert Pike admitted what some of those ultimate secrets were.
[02:11:36.184 --> 02:11:43.787]  Writer of Morals and Dogma, Supreme Grandmation of over 100 years ago, you know, the big granddaddy folks.
[02:11:44.327 --> 02:11:50.050]  And he said, we worship Lucifer, and then he gives us power, and that's the god they worship at the higher levels.
[02:11:50.070 --> 02:11:52.871]  When I went to the Bohemian Grove and saw...
[02:11:54.054 --> 02:12:01.779]  One of the mid-level rituals that most masons would never be allowed to see, but that the higher levels are even into more advanced black magic.
[02:12:02.319 --> 02:12:10.644]  I saw what you would kind of call golden dawn or not white magic, not black magic, but so ancient that it's just Babylonian.
[02:12:11.244 --> 02:12:18.268]  And they went through this earth mother, goddess, horn god stuff, basically paganism, Wiccan stuff.
[02:12:19.469 --> 02:12:23.111]  But most masons are lured in that, oh, this is a Christian organization.
[02:12:23.995 --> 02:12:30.437]  And over in England, there's been a lot of mainstream news articles about how you can't get a consulting job.
[02:12:30.477 --> 02:12:31.898]  You can't get a big government job.
[02:12:31.958 --> 02:12:38.180]  You can't get found not guilty unless you're a Mason or unless your barrister is a Mason.
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:41.401]  And they found out that they're all scratching each other's backs.
[02:12:41.461 --> 02:12:43.641]  It's like Italian mafia or something.
[02:12:46.342 --> 02:12:48.603]  It's kind of a wasp mob, you could say.
[02:12:49.782 --> 02:12:52.504]  And they team up with other Masons around the world.
[02:12:52.564 --> 02:12:53.825]  It's a global thing.
[02:12:55.266 --> 02:13:02.931]  My great-great-uncle told my father the story of when he was running bars during Prohibition in Houston.
[02:13:03.452 --> 02:13:05.113]  Some guys tried to rob him.
[02:13:05.173 --> 02:13:06.434]  He killed two of them.
[02:13:07.374 --> 02:13:12.618]  Walked in, flashed the Mason in distress sign at the judge, instantly case dismissed.
[02:13:13.278 --> 02:13:15.420]  So it's also basically a license to kill.
[02:13:16.266 --> 02:13:19.907]  Number one, Eric, you say you're practicing Master Mason.
[02:13:20.647 --> 02:13:22.608]  Has anything I've said been inaccurate?
[02:13:22.728 --> 02:13:25.609]  And then you say you're beginning to wake up to this and have questions.
[02:13:25.909 --> 02:13:26.649]  You have the floor.
[02:13:26.729 --> 02:13:27.289]  Go ahead.
[02:13:27.309 --> 02:13:28.270]  Oh, thanks, Alex.
[02:13:28.590 --> 02:13:30.990]  When I said Master Mason, I was talking about Blue Lodge.
[02:13:31.531 --> 02:13:34.512]  I had just the third-degree Master Mason degree.
[02:13:34.592 --> 02:13:39.893]  I have not gone into the higher levels up to the 32nd, although I had many offers.
[02:13:40.773 --> 02:13:42.614]  I was briefly involved with the Grotto Association,
[02:13:43.146 --> 02:13:48.789]  I had offers to go into the Eastern Star, which is primarily sort of the women's arm of the Masons.
[02:13:49.869 --> 02:13:54.551]  I was offered to go into Scottish Rite, York Rite, and various other things.
[02:13:54.631 --> 02:14:04.216]  But there's sort of a little voice gnawing at me, and I'm asking myself, okay, Eric, have you sort of been a useful idiot here in the trenches of this giant fraternity?
[02:14:04.236 --> 02:14:09.098]  I ask myself this question, have I sort of been a useful idiot practicing Christianity
[02:14:09.642 --> 02:14:13.585]  The tenets, I mean, the tenets that are preached in my lodge seem to be wonderful tenets.
[02:14:14.185 --> 02:14:18.888]  But is it a veneer for something that's far deeper and far more dark?
[02:14:19.389 --> 02:14:28.895]  Well, yeah, I mean, if you haven't even gotten into the Scottish Rite, and if you haven't got up into the higher degrees, by the way, there's 360 degrees.
[02:14:29.355 --> 02:14:29.696]  Really?
[02:14:30.076 --> 02:14:33.658]  Yeah, and humans can't go over about the 76.
[02:14:33.778 --> 02:14:33.838]  Huh.
[02:14:36.802 --> 02:14:43.067]  Yeah, and then there's Principality sitting at the other points of the compass with Lucifer at 360.
[02:14:43.987 --> 02:14:48.310]  Because, yeah, like I said, I was offered many times to go into the higher... And look where you are.
[02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:49.451]  You're at the third level.
[02:14:49.831 --> 02:14:53.114]  Well, technically they say the Master Mason is the highest rank.
[02:14:53.834 --> 02:14:54.815]  The third degree.
[02:14:54.875 --> 02:15:01.400]  When you are raised to a Master Mason, that is... And then they claim that the 33rd degree is only honorary.
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:02.941]  That's what they say.
[02:15:03.601 --> 02:15:04.202]  Not true.
[02:15:04.682 --> 02:15:05.102]  I'm sorry?
[02:15:05.523 --> 02:15:06.083]  Not true.
[02:15:06.488 --> 02:15:06.928]  Oh, really?
[02:15:07.148 --> 02:15:07.669]  Not true.
[02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.970]  There's a lot of things.
[02:15:09.170 --> 02:15:11.091]  Like I said, Alex, I'm sort of a neophyte here.
[02:15:11.131 --> 02:15:12.912]  I'm just beginning to learn all this stuff.
[02:15:13.012 --> 02:15:15.173]  There's so many chapters, so many verses.
[02:15:16.294 --> 02:15:19.075]  And I'm just sort of on the beginning of a very long journey.
[02:15:20.256 --> 02:15:22.077]  But, you know, I got involved.
[02:15:22.157 --> 02:15:26.020]  I was working at the shipyard in Groton.
[02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:33.144]  And then I was, you know, in fact, I was involved with the design and the construction of Trident subs, the ballistic missile subs.
[02:15:34.425 --> 02:15:34.585]  And...
[02:15:35.748 --> 02:15:37.469]  Yeah, a mason's not supposed to ask you to join.
[02:16:02.239 --> 02:16:03.059]  Well, they didn't ask me to join.
[02:16:03.079 --> 02:16:05.800]  But I've had them ask me to join over and over and over again.
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:06.400]  Really?
[02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:09.560]  No, they can do it very subtly without coming out and asking you.
[02:16:09.580 --> 02:16:10.561]  Would you like to join?
[02:16:10.581 --> 02:16:12.401]  You know, people ask to join.
[02:16:12.921 --> 02:16:13.961]  We'd like to talk to you.
[02:16:14.001 --> 02:16:16.602]  We'd like you to, well, have you thought about joining?
[02:16:16.942 --> 02:16:17.662]  Right, exactly.
[02:16:18.282 --> 02:16:21.863]  So I just wanted to mention that to you, and I also have something here.
[02:16:22.443 --> 02:16:29.004]  There was an article in my paper over the weekend about Admiral Kimmel, Pearl Harbor, the fight presses on.
[02:16:30.038 --> 02:16:32.399]  If you'd like, I can send it to you from the New London Day.
[02:16:32.419 --> 02:16:37.461]  And it has a whole... Admiral Kimmel, he died in 1968 in Groton.
[02:16:37.541 --> 02:16:41.062]  In fact, he lived like right down the street from where I grew up.
[02:16:42.223 --> 02:16:43.823]  And he was stripped of two bars.
[02:16:44.544 --> 02:16:53.727]  And there's a group here locally that's trying to press Mr. Bush, who's sitting on his nice little hands, not doing anything about exonerating Admiral Kimmel.
[02:16:55.087 --> 02:16:58.929]  And his family and friends have been pressing for like two years now
[02:16:59.966 --> 02:17:05.068]  To exonerate him officially via presidential decree, and Bush isn't doing anything.
[02:17:05.989 --> 02:17:14.293]  And I think that he's concerned that if he admits it to a cover-up in Pearl Harbor, well, jeez, maybe there was a big cover-up in 9-11, too.
[02:17:14.793 --> 02:17:21.256]  Well, look, just like the Kennedy assassination, just like Gulf of Tonkin, all of this is fake.
[02:17:21.356 --> 02:17:22.937]  Pearl Harbor was a staged event.
[02:17:23.637 --> 02:17:27.179]  That's an admitted fact, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:17:27.559 --> 02:17:29.380]  Alex, I could send you the article if you'd like.
[02:17:30.151 --> 02:17:31.152]  Yes, please do that.
[02:17:31.813 --> 02:17:32.413]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:17:32.473 --> 02:17:32.654]  Thanks.
[02:17:32.894 --> 02:17:33.494]  Thank you, sir.
[02:17:35.116 --> 02:17:37.638]  Yeah, I mean, look, it's like the CIA.
[02:17:37.698 --> 02:17:39.340]  Most people are good in the CIA.
[02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:40.621]  They're compartmentalized.
[02:17:40.741 --> 02:17:42.863]  Most people are good in the Masonic Lodges.
[02:17:44.385 --> 02:17:47.027]  They don't know what they're part of.
[02:17:48.388 --> 02:17:52.492]  That's why you've got to judge a tree by its fruits to know what the person's really up to.
[02:17:54.474 --> 02:17:55.215]  Let's go ahead.
[02:17:56.150 --> 02:18:02.193]  And talk to, I guess, up next here is Howard in Colorado.
[02:18:02.213 --> 02:18:03.213]  Howard, thanks for holding.
[02:18:03.253 --> 02:18:03.714]  Go ahead.
[02:18:03.914 --> 02:18:04.954]  Yeah, Alex, how are you?
[02:18:04.994 --> 02:18:05.975]  You have a great show.
[02:18:06.055 --> 02:18:09.857]  Actually, I'm from Washington, D.C., and I've been doing a lot of demonstrating.
[02:18:10.497 --> 02:18:19.221]  I spend three or four nights a week in front of the White House chanting against this Bush and this regime that he's set up.
[02:18:19.301 --> 02:18:23.103]  And as far as I'm concerned, this is nothing more than a fascist government
[02:18:24.131 --> 02:18:27.412]  And I have one thing or two things I want to talk to you.
[02:18:27.852 --> 02:18:33.113]  This is curtains ordered for media coverage on returning coffins, which I'm sure you're aware of.
[02:18:33.793 --> 02:18:40.614]  And this is what Barbara Bush, George Bush's mother, said on Good Morning America on March 18, 2003.
[02:18:42.074 --> 02:18:47.775]  Her quote is, let me quote her, Why should we hear about body bags and deaths and how many?
[02:18:48.935 --> 02:18:51.476]  What day is going to happen and how many?
[02:18:51.576 --> 02:18:52.016]  This or...
[02:18:52.543 --> 02:18:53.704]  What do you suppose?
[02:18:53.924 --> 02:18:55.865]  Oh, I mean, it's not relevant.
[02:18:56.405 --> 02:18:59.966]  So why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that?
[02:19:00.547 --> 02:19:05.229]  Well, so far, as of... Well, let me stop you and I'll hold you over.
[02:19:05.369 --> 02:19:05.929]  Okay.
[02:19:06.009 --> 02:19:16.534]  Barbara Bush, about a month ago, said on CNN's Larry King Live, and we've got the transcript posted, she said, if anybody talks about my husband or my children, they're dead.
[02:19:17.834 --> 02:19:19.015]  Now, that's a death threat.
[02:19:20.413 --> 02:19:24.918]  From the former first lady, the CIA director's wife, I take that serious.
[02:19:25.078 --> 02:19:35.549]  And the woman that sued the president alleging rape got shot in the back of the head about a month ago in Houston, Texas, and it only rated a mere mention in the obituary.
[02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:41.475]  So I take it serious when Barbara Bush starts talking about how you talk bad about her family, you're dead.
[02:19:41.535 --> 02:19:41.896]  Stay there.
[02:19:41.936 --> 02:19:42.937]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:19:45.982 --> 02:19:46.643]  We're good to go.
[02:20:04.966 --> 02:20:05.166]  I think.
[02:20:21.425 --> 02:20:21.925]  That's right.
[02:20:22.105 --> 02:20:29.227]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:20:29.507 --> 02:20:38.270]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:38.310 --> 02:20:38.770]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:20:47.381 --> 02:20:52.086]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:20:52.247 --> 02:20:52.847]  Yes, it's true.
[02:20:52.867 --> 02:20:55.630]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:20:55.751 --> 02:20:59.735]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills in Viagra.
[02:20:59.835 --> 02:21:00.416]  You heard it right.
[02:21:00.556 --> 02:21:05.542]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[02:21:05.622 --> 02:21:06.663]  The list goes on and on.
[02:21:06.903 --> 02:21:07.844]  You may miss out forever.
[02:21:23.695 --> 02:21:24.095]  We're good to go.
[02:21:45.822 --> 02:21:46.263]  Gold.
[02:21:46.623 --> 02:21:47.904]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:21:48.145 --> 02:21:54.251]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:21:54.431 --> 02:21:58.275]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:21:58.616 --> 02:22:00.517]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:22:00.558 --> 02:22:00.738]  Mint,
[02:22:01.078 --> 02:22:02.840]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[02:22:02.980 --> 02:22:10.707]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:22:11.067 --> 02:22:19.975]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[02:23:55.151 --> 02:23:56.691]  All right, we're talking to Howard.
[02:23:57.752 --> 02:24:00.112]  And Howard, so you're in Washington, D.C.
[02:24:00.152 --> 02:24:00.492]  right now?
[02:24:00.512 --> 02:24:02.373]  No, no, I'm in Colorado.
[02:24:02.433 --> 02:24:03.993]  Okay, good, because you told us Colorado.
[02:24:04.013 --> 02:24:04.953]  That's why we said that.
[02:24:05.273 --> 02:24:06.814]  I'm up in Eagle Vale.
[02:24:07.254 --> 02:24:08.214]  But let me say this.
[02:24:08.254 --> 02:24:09.614]  But you're saying you've been in D.C.
[02:24:09.654 --> 02:24:10.194]  protesting.
[02:24:10.234 --> 02:24:10.635]  Go ahead.
[02:24:10.875 --> 02:24:15.296]  Oh, yeah, well, I live there part of the year, and I know it's just like a police state there.
[02:24:15.336 --> 02:24:21.217]  I'm continually harassed in front of the White House by the Uniformed Secret Service, the Park Police, and
[02:24:21.849 --> 02:24:22.989]  Watched all the time.
[02:24:23.009 --> 02:24:25.030]  I mean, it's just nothing but a police state.
[02:24:25.090 --> 02:24:32.573]  And as of October 17, 2003, there was 336 men killed in the same period in Vietnam.
[02:24:32.633 --> 02:24:34.494]  There were only 324 killed.
[02:24:34.734 --> 02:24:38.976]  And also, I would add to this that you mentioned the covering up the coffins.
[02:24:38.996 --> 02:24:39.696]  That's right.
[02:24:39.796 --> 02:24:41.517]  I mean, that's what the Soviets did.
[02:24:41.657 --> 02:24:45.938]  Why are they putting up curtains so we can't see how many are dead?
[02:24:46.458 --> 02:24:49.960]  They don't want any media coverage because it arouses too much...
[02:24:51.055 --> 02:24:52.896]  That's absolutely right.
[02:24:52.916 --> 02:24:57.098]  At Walter Reed Army Medical Center, you can't get in there, or the Naval Hospital.
[02:25:20.060 --> 02:25:21.461]  Or the VA hospital.
[02:25:21.561 --> 02:25:26.405]  So, I mean, there's a total curtain on this, and it's all a lot of whitewash.
[02:25:26.465 --> 02:25:32.070]  And not surprisingly, there have been reports of all the big bases, the medical bases, not giving people treatment for months.
[02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:33.731]  That's exactly right.
[02:25:33.751 --> 02:25:35.753]  So what happens when you don't have oversight?
[02:25:35.833 --> 02:25:36.754]  Bad things happen.
[02:25:36.794 --> 02:25:37.895]  It's a historical fact.
[02:25:38.555 --> 02:25:40.717]  Yeah, well, that's absolutely correct.
[02:25:41.357 --> 02:25:47.002]  The other thing I want to mention, did you know that Prescott Bush, George Bush's grandfather, funds,
[02:25:47.546 --> 02:25:51.527]  We're taking under the War Powers Act for supporting Nazi Germany.
[02:25:51.867 --> 02:26:01.831]  Yeah, he first got in trouble in 1942, then he got busted again in 1953, running the Nazis out of Germany and controlling their assets until 1953.
[02:26:02.171 --> 02:26:07.112]  Yeah, so this is the kind of slime and gum that we've got running our government.
[02:26:07.192 --> 02:26:09.493]  Now, you've certainly got to understand, though, Howard, that...
[02:26:10.687 --> 02:26:11.647]  They're just puppets.
[02:26:11.707 --> 02:26:13.029]  Bill Clinton was bad, too.
[02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:14.790]  Yeah, oh, I understand that.
[02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:21.716]  I mean, the whole thing is... Yeah, because if we just say one party's bad, it helps the globalists, because they've still got the other party we're believing in.
[02:26:21.756 --> 02:26:24.018]  No, no, I understand that.
[02:26:24.078 --> 02:26:27.801]  These guys already, they got their marching orders for the time they get in there.
[02:26:29.274 --> 02:26:30.175]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:26:30.195 --> 02:26:32.457]  I appreciate you taking action, Howard.
[02:26:32.497 --> 02:26:33.738]  Great job as an American.
[02:26:34.018 --> 02:26:38.882]  That's what America's all about, is demonstrating and protesting and writing letters and marching.
[02:26:39.283 --> 02:26:40.764]  It's all about taking action.
[02:26:40.804 --> 02:26:42.065]  It's so American.
[02:26:42.565 --> 02:26:43.807]  Ralph in Oklahoma.
[02:26:43.907 --> 02:26:44.807]  Ralph, welcome.
[02:26:45.708 --> 02:26:46.389]  Yes, Alex.
[02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.390]  Hi.
[02:26:49.269 --> 02:26:50.010]  Are you there, Alex?
[02:26:50.410 --> 02:26:51.010]  Yes, I am.
[02:26:51.411 --> 02:26:57.755]  Okay, I spoke with John Saturday, and I was surprised he didn't know a thing about it.
[02:26:58.816 --> 02:27:02.079]  Anyway, that's the Scott Eisenberg case in Oklahoma.
[02:27:03.039 --> 02:27:04.160]  I'm about to get to that.
[02:27:04.220 --> 02:27:05.521]  I mentioned it in the first hour.
[02:27:05.581 --> 02:27:07.122]  Okay, you're already up on it.
[02:27:07.142 --> 02:27:08.503]  Well, why don't you tell folks about it?
[02:27:09.024 --> 02:27:13.367]  Well, best I know, this probably started in late October 2010.
[02:27:14.695 --> 02:27:21.260]  He killed two people there in the Depew area, and they had him surrounded in a 10-acre wooded patch.
[02:27:22.101 --> 02:27:27.665]  Okay, the establishment spent 30 days or better there in an untold fortune.
[02:27:28.106 --> 02:27:31.688]  Couldn't flush him out, and I guess they gave up on it, and you didn't hear it.
[02:27:31.728 --> 02:27:35.031]  You know, that was the end of the topic of all your news you heard.
[02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:38.181]  And then just a little while, he re-emerges.
[02:27:38.301 --> 02:27:39.841]  I guess it was in Arkansas.
[02:27:39.861 --> 02:27:41.982]  There was an Arkansas doctor and his wife.
[02:27:42.042 --> 02:27:44.643]  He kidnapped them and they wound up in Texas.
[02:27:45.543 --> 02:27:59.688]  And once he revealed to them that he had nothing to lose and who he was and all that, the doctor pulls his little .22 caliber revolver out and shoots him four times in the chest.
[02:27:59.748 --> 02:28:00.268]  Well, that's
[02:28:01.075 --> 02:28:03.175]  Yeah, he should have had a .357 Magnum or a .357 Sig.
[02:28:03.295 --> 02:28:09.297]  I know somebody comes in my house, they're going to get shot with a Mossberg shotgun, and they're going to get seven rounds.
[02:28:09.337 --> 02:28:09.697]  Semi-auto.
[02:28:09.717 --> 02:28:15.178]  But anyway, within three days, it's almost just like Oklahoma City.
[02:28:31.437 --> 02:28:34.998]  When this thing first started to clear back in, let's say, late October.
[02:28:35.018 --> 02:28:40.480]  Yeah, when a citizen defended and then what the cops couldn't get done, suddenly the story disappears.
[02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:46.422]  There are stacks of articles every day where people defend themselves.
[02:28:47.082 --> 02:28:55.485]  Folks, guns are used conservatively five times more often to stop crime by citizens.
[02:28:55.525 --> 02:28:59.546]  That's not counting the police numbers to stop crime, and they are used in crimes.
[02:28:59.687 --> 02:29:00.927]  Guns make us safe.
[02:29:01.985 --> 02:29:04.007]  Yeah, what is that, about 20 cents?
[02:29:20.786 --> 02:29:22.487]  For a 22, I'd be way left.
[02:29:22.527 --> 02:29:25.648]  For four rounds with a 22, it'd be a lot less than 20 cents.
[02:29:25.708 --> 02:29:28.329]  I wonder why the doctor didn't put it up to his temple.
[02:29:28.670 --> 02:29:30.450]  I'm sure he's wondering that himself.
[02:29:31.251 --> 02:29:32.571]  Yeah, they'll probably arrest him.
[02:29:32.611 --> 02:29:33.652]  They would in England.
[02:29:33.712 --> 02:29:34.712]  Yeah, I'm waiting on that.
[02:29:34.732 --> 02:29:35.172]  We'll be back.
[02:29:35.192 --> 02:29:35.513]  Stay there.
[02:29:36.393 --> 02:29:37.293]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.794 --> 02:29:39.414]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.335 --> 02:29:43.016]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.195 --> 02:29:47.876]  I really needed to lose weight.
[02:29:47.896 --> 02:29:49.498]  I was tired, lethargic.
[02:29:49.698 --> 02:29:54.521]  So far, using the collagenate, I've lost 46 pounds.
[02:29:54.541 --> 02:29:57.163]  46 pounds with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:29:57.564 --> 02:29:59.285]  Bernadine, tell me about those inches.
[02:29:59.605 --> 02:30:03.028]  Inches off my chest, my waist, my hips, my thighs.
[02:30:03.328 --> 02:30:06.831]  I was at about 20, pushing into a size 22.
[02:30:06.911 --> 02:30:08.832]  I'm down to a size 14.
[02:30:09.233 --> 02:30:10.994]  People have been telling me I look younger.
[02:30:11.454 --> 02:30:14.977]  I've lost 46 pounds with collagenate.
[02:30:15.277 --> 02:30:17.777]  It's just one of the best investments I've ever made.
[02:30:17.978 --> 02:30:24.059]  I am so glad that Bernadine took my advice to lose weight the safe and healthy way with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:30:24.299 --> 02:30:27.919]  That was Bernadine's personal experience, and it can be yours next.
[02:30:27.979 --> 02:30:28.839]  What are you waiting for?
[02:30:29.180 --> 02:30:30.380]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:30.700]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:32.180]  And get $25 off a three-month supply of collagenate.

[02:31:10.703 --> 02:31:10.943]  I think?

[02:31:38.911 --> 02:31:39.412]  Don't wait.
[02:31:39.692 --> 02:31:40.312]  Do it today.
[02:31:40.673 --> 02:31:41.113]  The number 800-686-2237.
[02:31:45.973 --> 02:31:47.774]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[02:31:47.974 --> 02:31:50.835]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[02:31:51.095 --> 02:31:52.916]  Call Term Busters now.
[02:31:53.236 --> 02:31:54.597]  Rates are low right now.
[02:31:54.737 --> 02:31:55.897]  Call and compare.
[02:31:56.158 --> 02:32:06.642]  For example, a man age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1 million of coverage is only $75 a month level for the next 10 years.
[02:32:06.922 --> 02:32:08.623]  Call Term Busters now.
[02:32:08.663 --> 02:32:09.183]  We're good to go.

[02:32:37.996 --> 02:32:39.616]  Operators are standing by.
[02:32:39.636 --> 02:32:40.336]  800-430-6692 800-430-6692 Alright, folks.
[02:32:54.545 --> 02:32:59.948]  I'm going to take about four more calls quickly because I've got to launch into some of the news we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:32:59.988 --> 02:33:00.968]  Believe me, it's important.
[02:33:01.688 --> 02:33:05.950]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brock in British Columbia.
[02:33:06.310 --> 02:33:06.991]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:33:07.051 --> 02:33:07.711]  You're on the air.
[02:33:09.672 --> 02:33:10.853]  Good to talk to you, Brock.
[02:33:13.414 --> 02:33:19.797]  I wanted to ask you about Planet X and is it for real?
[02:33:19.897 --> 02:33:20.517]  What is it?
[02:33:21.321 --> 02:33:27.306]  And I also wanted to ask, in a nutshell, if you could, who killed John F. Kennedy?
[02:33:28.286 --> 02:33:29.928]  Okay, Brock, let me answer those questions.
[02:33:29.968 --> 02:33:30.728]  Thanks for the call.
[02:33:32.530 --> 02:33:41.156]  If you've been listening to the show for a long period of time, you know that I said three years ago, four years ago, that Planet X was a complete fraud.
[02:33:41.176 --> 02:33:48.882]  I mean, it comes from Zacharias Sitchin, the little New Age propagandist funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation.
[02:33:50.160 --> 02:34:08.966]  And he goes and interprets these Sumerian texts, and it's been proven that he interpreted them wrong, and there's this tenth planet that's going to swing around every 3,600 years and kill us, cause earthquakes and titanic floods and all the rest of this.
[02:34:11.426 --> 02:34:17.248]  And everybody got on the air, not everybody, but a lot of people, and picked up on this and said, oh, it's the end of the world, it's going to hit us.
[02:34:17.268 --> 02:34:19.709]  It was supposed to kill us last summer.
[02:34:22.049 --> 02:34:28.150]  And then, strangely enough, you notice that Mars got closer to the Earth than it had been in hundreds of thousands of years.
[02:34:30.251 --> 02:34:38.253]  And, in fact, it got half as close than from what normally is.
[02:34:38.973 --> 02:34:42.674]  It covered half the distance from its normal orbit around the Earth.
[02:34:44.334 --> 02:34:49.215]  And a lot of researchers, like Tex Mars and others, have looked at this and said,
[02:34:50.029 --> 02:34:54.632]  Said that the Planet X phenomenon is a coming of the occult.
[02:34:55.512 --> 02:34:59.374]  And so this was all a double meaning for the occultist in high places.
[02:35:00.375 --> 02:35:10.020]  And again, when I talk about occultists in high places, I mean Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, the Thule Society, real stuff we can prove is going on.
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:12.281]  I want to talk about real documented issues.
[02:35:13.341 --> 02:35:16.183]  And so for them, they meant, by Planet X, they meant
[02:35:17.177 --> 02:35:22.118]  Mars getting close to the Earth as the sign of their coming to power.
[02:35:24.098 --> 02:35:25.939]  And Mars is still quite close to the Earth.
[02:35:26.059 --> 02:35:32.040]  It gains more distance back to its normal position every day, every minute.
[02:35:33.660 --> 02:35:43.142]  But it's still a lot larger and more prominent in the sky than it is in any thousand-year wait you might engage in.
[02:35:44.975 --> 02:35:47.097]  So what happened a few months ago was very historical.
[02:35:48.058 --> 02:36:01.893]  But Planet X, I predicted three, four years ago that when it didn't hit us, the scammers would then say, or the useful idiots would then say, oh, Planet X was on the Gregorian calendar,
[02:36:02.666 --> 02:36:04.207]  It was all three years.
[02:36:04.447 --> 02:36:07.470]  So it's really coming in three years now.
[02:36:07.790 --> 02:36:12.773]  And just like clockwork, they said, oh, it's the Gregorian calendar.
[02:36:12.873 --> 02:36:13.774]  We were wrong.
[02:36:14.795 --> 02:36:18.878]  Now it's going to be coming in two years, three years from now.
[02:36:20.599 --> 02:36:25.182]  So they can keep selling their books and videos, and that is exactly what they did.
[02:36:25.242 --> 02:36:26.863]  It wasn't a hard guess.
[02:36:27.824 --> 02:36:31.987]  These scam preachers that say the end of the world is next year, give me all your money.
[02:36:34.342 --> 02:36:43.685]  Every time the end of the world didn't come, you know, in 1987 or whatever, like they'd said, they would then say, oh, it's the Gregorian calendar.
[02:36:43.725 --> 02:36:45.026]  It's in three years.
[02:36:45.786 --> 02:36:48.067]  And then start the whole process over again.
[02:36:49.207 --> 02:36:51.948]  So why stick to legislation and bills and real things?
[02:36:51.968 --> 02:36:53.468]  I'll tell you what is scary.
[02:36:53.988 --> 02:37:01.771]  Record sun blast, solar coronas, ejections, super flares,
[02:37:03.070 --> 02:37:07.551]  That have never been seen before in the last 160 years since they've been recording it.
[02:37:09.012 --> 02:37:12.453]  But again, we only have 160 years of data, so is this abnormal?
[02:37:12.473 --> 02:37:13.133]  We don't know.
[02:37:13.653 --> 02:37:14.294]  That's real.
[02:37:14.334 --> 02:37:15.054]  That's scary.
[02:37:15.754 --> 02:37:20.656]  Genetically engineered super weapons that kill specific races of humans.
[02:37:21.876 --> 02:37:22.936]  Those are real.
[02:37:23.116 --> 02:37:24.377]  Those are scary.
[02:37:24.417 --> 02:37:26.817]  That is nightmarish to the 10th degree.
[02:37:31.062 --> 02:37:36.225]  The genetic engineering of the food crops, killing the life cycle where plants don't create their own seeds.
[02:37:36.766 --> 02:37:39.067]  Monsanto trying to buy up all the seed companies.
[02:37:39.448 --> 02:37:40.969]  That's ominous and frightening.
[02:37:40.989 --> 02:37:42.850]  So there's enough real stuff.
[02:37:42.930 --> 02:37:48.433]  But governments into these type of scams, into world scams, get control with their global warming.
[02:37:48.874 --> 02:37:51.235]  A lot of preachers get a lot of gas mileage out of it.
[02:37:51.375 --> 02:37:51.996]  I don't do it.
[02:37:52.896 --> 02:37:54.237]  Now that was your first question.
[02:37:54.257 --> 02:37:55.358]  You asked who killed Kennedy?
[02:37:56.355 --> 02:38:19.716]  The large banks that own the military industrial complex ordered Texas hitmen and others under CIA control, and we've had the witnesses and the people that were there and LBJ's lawyer and his mistress on the show, and it's all admitted now that they did the planning and execution, but the big bankers pulled the lever, ordered the hit.
[02:38:20.808 --> 02:38:23.490]  Because Kennedy wanted to get us out of the Federal Reserve.
[02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:27.632]  He wanted to stop letting corporations be international and leave the U.S.
[02:38:28.172 --> 02:38:30.113]  He was going to increase tariffs on trade.
[02:38:30.133 --> 02:38:31.694]  He was getting us out of Vietnam.
[02:38:32.114 --> 02:38:33.235]  He cut taxes by 50%.
[02:38:34.756 --> 02:38:36.017]  They were not happy with him.
[02:38:36.057 --> 02:38:37.597]  He was going to abolish the CIA.
[02:38:38.298 --> 02:38:41.500]  Let's talk to Don in North Carolina.
[02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:42.480]  Don, you're on the air.
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:42.940]  Go ahead.
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:44.241]  Hi, Alex.
[02:38:44.281 --> 02:38:45.582]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:38:45.622 --> 02:38:45.922]  You bet.
[02:38:45.942 --> 02:38:47.303]  I've got a quick question.
[02:38:48.274 --> 02:38:49.375]  I was looking at a video.
[02:38:49.455 --> 02:38:51.016]  It's on the Propaganda Matrix.
[02:38:51.796 --> 02:38:55.518]  It was done by John Pilger.
[02:38:55.538 --> 02:38:57.059]  It's called Breaking the Silence.
[02:38:58.039 --> 02:38:59.560]  Yeah, it's a streaming video.
[02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:05.524]  It's leftist stuff about the UN being our savior, but the news about Afghanistan and Iraq is very accurate.
[02:39:06.244 --> 02:39:09.406]  Yeah, I was just wondering, is there a chance maybe you could have him on as a guest?
[02:39:11.027 --> 02:39:12.868]  I thought about that when I watched it, yes.
[02:39:13.308 --> 02:39:14.769]  Yeah, because he seems pretty knowledgeable.
[02:39:16.314 --> 02:39:19.056]  You know, it's a pretty interesting video if people want to watch it.
[02:39:19.096 --> 02:39:21.217]  It's on the multimedia section.
[02:39:22.798 --> 02:39:29.483]  And one other thing I just wanted to mention real quick about the Freemasonry and the Scottish Rite Journal.
[02:39:32.165 --> 02:39:34.206]  It's the March 2002 edition.
[02:39:34.226 --> 02:39:40.070]  I have some photographs of one of the Grand Masons, Erica, in Cuba.
[02:39:40.090 --> 02:39:42.692]  It says in here that Cuba...
[02:39:44.192 --> 02:39:47.054]  There's over 316 lodges on the island.
[02:39:47.635 --> 02:39:51.477]  So you've got to wonder why Cuba, the small island, needs 316 lodges.
[02:39:51.517 --> 02:39:54.219]  Yeah, and you have to wonder why.
[02:39:54.259 --> 02:39:56.040]  It's such a freedom organization.
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:58.621]  Why hasn't Fidel kicked it out of the country?
[02:39:59.342 --> 02:40:00.463]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:40:00.883 --> 02:40:04.585]  Down in Charlotte, you know, Charlotte's pretty well inundated with Freemasonry.
[02:40:05.806 --> 02:40:08.668]  And, you know, they have all-seeing eyes on the pavement down here.
[02:40:08.748 --> 02:40:11.890]  And bees, you know, they put bees on the pavement.
[02:40:13.035 --> 02:40:17.638]  They named their original basketball team the Hornets, and they played in the Beehive.
[02:40:18.299 --> 02:40:21.661]  They named their hockey team as the Checkers.
[02:40:22.522 --> 02:40:25.064]  Checkerboard is symbolic of the Masons.
[02:40:25.184 --> 02:40:27.425]  There's a lot of obelisks.
[02:40:27.466 --> 02:40:28.666]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:40:28.826 --> 02:40:32.389]  Obelisks, all-seeing eyes, the Checkers.
[02:40:32.409 --> 02:40:35.091]  The Carlyle Group has an office here in Charlotte, too.
[02:40:36.652 --> 02:40:38.754]  They actually have an office right here in Charlotte.
[02:40:38.794 --> 02:40:41.896]  James Baker has a business here, too, but I think it has to do with
[02:40:42.970 --> 02:40:43.650]  I know what it is.
[02:40:43.770 --> 02:40:47.131]  It's book publishing for libraries and schools.
[02:40:48.591 --> 02:40:49.791]  I'd have to pull up the documents.
[02:40:49.931 --> 02:40:52.252]  Yeah, it's an educational system.
[02:40:52.352 --> 02:40:53.412]  Yeah, yes.
[02:40:54.132 --> 02:40:58.293]  There's a lot of... Things are in Charlotte because of the big banks here.
[02:40:58.313 --> 02:41:01.633]  I think they're number two banking center behind New York.
[02:41:01.693 --> 02:41:03.974]  By the way, they've looked at James Baker's textbooks.
[02:41:04.334 --> 02:41:08.615]  You'd think Bill Clinton had written them, but he's so conservative.
[02:41:09.255 --> 02:41:10.495]  Yeah, wasn't he just...
[02:41:12.034 --> 02:41:18.576]  Ended over the Iraqi... He's going to manage the reconstruction of Iraq or something.
[02:41:18.596 --> 02:41:24.198]  Yeah, the hundreds of billions of dollars of funds will be managed by James Baker.
[02:41:25.758 --> 02:41:32.040]  And then they'll say, oh, he's independent as he hands out the contracts to Dick Cheney and others.
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:37.742]  It's blatant, out-of-control corruption right in front of our faces.
[02:41:38.182 --> 02:41:41.563]  And how do you think these neocons, Don...
[02:41:42.632 --> 02:41:50.140]  Sit here while Bush pushes through more gun control than has ever been seen, and they hail him as this wonderful conservative.
[02:41:52.302 --> 02:41:53.343]  People are just stupid.
[02:41:53.944 --> 02:41:54.785]  Even my friends.
[02:41:54.825 --> 02:42:00.551]  You can show them the doggone contrails in the sky day in and day out.
[02:42:01.274 --> 02:42:03.514]  And they just say, well, that's just an atmosphere effect.
[02:42:03.594 --> 02:42:04.275]  I mean, it's pollution.
[02:42:04.355 --> 02:42:05.635]  Well, that's a question I have.
[02:42:05.755 --> 02:42:14.137]  Why do the trails disappear in seconds a few years ago, but now they hang there for hours, but planes right next to it aren't leaving trails?
[02:42:14.157 --> 02:42:15.657]  I just don't know why that's happening.
[02:42:16.297 --> 02:42:22.699]  Well, I've seen it down in south Texas, where I'm from originally, and I've actually seen an airplane.
[02:42:22.739 --> 02:42:23.239]  It looked like a 707.
[02:42:24.179 --> 02:42:28.520]  It was at a lower altitude, and he was just blowing stuff up the...
[02:42:30.425 --> 02:42:31.606]  You back the airplane.
[02:42:31.946 --> 02:42:35.408]  He was low enough to see that I could actually identify the airplane.
[02:42:35.808 --> 02:42:36.229]  I hear you.
[02:42:36.249 --> 02:42:37.109]  Thanks for the call, Don.
[02:42:37.649 --> 02:42:38.430]  Two last calls.
[02:42:38.450 --> 02:42:39.310]  I've got to move quick here.
[02:42:40.051 --> 02:42:42.472]  Let's talk to Stan in Missouri, then Spencer.
[02:42:42.512 --> 02:42:43.193]  Go ahead, Stan.
[02:42:43.713 --> 02:42:44.994]  Hello, Alex.
[02:42:45.274 --> 02:42:58.162]  I heard you talking earlier about the NRA wanting this gun registration, and then you said also that they wanted to be able to tell us, give us permission where we could drive around with a gunner car and all this.
[02:43:00.001 --> 02:43:01.902]  The NRA does not own us, Alex.
[02:43:04.844 --> 02:43:12.908]  Well, for those that don't know that just joined us, the Supreme Court ruled that they agree with the ruling by the Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
[02:43:12.928 --> 02:43:21.572]  So you've got the Republican-controlled court agreeing with the socialist court, and the San Francisco court said, federal court,
[02:43:22.399 --> 02:43:26.280]  They can ban any gun they want, but the Second Amendment is not an individual right.
[02:43:26.740 --> 02:43:28.721]  Now, they said that, what, six months ago.
[02:43:29.201 --> 02:43:35.342]  Now the Supreme Court throws out this suit against it and says we agree with the lower court.
[02:43:35.962 --> 02:43:39.223]  And, again, you're not going to hear word one about this from Rush Limbaugh.
[02:43:40.784 --> 02:43:46.005]  Alex, you remember they've had two different court interpretations on the Second Amendment.
[02:43:46.385 --> 02:43:48.546]  They need to get their act together.
[02:43:48.586 --> 02:43:49.526]  They really do.
[02:43:49.546 --> 02:43:49.646]  They...
[02:43:50.532 --> 02:43:53.014]  These people, this is just completely insane.
[02:43:54.175 --> 02:44:00.159]  Well, yes, we have the Fifth Circuit saying it is an individual right that cannot be infringed.
[02:44:00.199 --> 02:44:03.262]  Then you have the California court saying it can be.
[02:44:03.822 --> 02:44:08.245]  But now the big Supreme Court says, oh, we're going with San Francisco.
[02:44:08.265 --> 02:44:09.927]  Yeah.
[02:44:10.547 --> 02:44:15.631]  So I'd like people to call into the Sean Hannity's and the, oh, I forgot, they screened the calls, you won't get through.
[02:44:15.651 --> 02:44:19.254]  I'd like you to call through to the Michael Wiener's
[02:44:20.227 --> 02:44:21.649]  I mean, savages of the world.
[02:44:22.069 --> 02:44:23.090]  The name's Wiener, folks.
[02:44:23.630 --> 02:44:24.892]  And stand up to them.
[02:44:25.812 --> 02:44:27.294]  That's what we've got to do, Alex.
[02:44:27.354 --> 02:44:34.520]  We've got some corruption going on right now down here in Sedalia, Missouri, with a public administrator named Marilyn Smith.
[02:44:35.321 --> 02:44:39.445]  And those people are not familiar with what a public administrator's job is.
[02:44:39.485 --> 02:44:41.967]  They take care of the disabled and the elderly.
[02:44:41.987 --> 02:44:46.071]  They're not able to take care of their financial resources.
[02:44:46.909 --> 02:44:51.190]  Well, what this young lady did, Alex, will really make your blood boil.
[02:44:51.771 --> 02:44:58.653]  She was in charge of taking care of an 83-year-old blind lady's house and taking care of her.
[02:44:58.713 --> 02:45:07.996]  Well, she had a cleaning entourage that went into her house, and they found $90,000 underneath this poor lady's carpet.
[02:45:08.256 --> 02:45:09.256]  So what do they do?
[02:45:09.296 --> 02:45:12.417]  They go in there and they take it to her, Marilyn Smith,
[02:45:13.123 --> 02:45:16.305]  And what she does, she said that the house was only evaluated like $1,000.
[02:45:16.665 --> 02:45:24.190]  She spends $54,000 on this lady's house to get it back in shape.
[02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:30.093]  This is the kind of corruption that's going on in your local and your state administrations, Alex.
[02:45:30.114 --> 02:45:32.655]  And I'm sure all of her buddies got the bids.
[02:45:32.715 --> 02:45:33.476]  Yes, Alex.
[02:45:33.596 --> 02:45:36.077]  And then everything they've done to this poor lady, too.
[02:45:36.417 --> 02:45:37.798]  They were taking her to church.
[02:45:37.818 --> 02:45:39.539]  Now, you're really going to love this one.
[02:45:40.942 --> 02:45:42.243]  You know, the church is there.
[02:45:42.563 --> 02:45:45.786]  They ought to go in, you know, and help the elderly, you know, take them.
[02:45:46.226 --> 02:45:52.811]  One of the guys who was going to her church was charging her $100 a month just to take this poor elderly lady to church.
[02:45:55.153 --> 02:45:55.853]  All right, thanks.
[02:45:55.993 --> 02:45:56.754]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:56.794 --> 02:45:57.915]  Boy, that's sad.
[02:45:57.935 --> 02:45:58.535]  That's sick.
[02:45:59.616 --> 02:46:01.357]  Last caller, Spencer in Ohio.
[02:46:01.377 --> 02:46:02.138]  Go ahead, Spencer.
[02:46:02.478 --> 02:46:08.703]  Sir Alex, I always wondered why the Constitution didn't mention government by the Masons for the Masons.
[02:46:09.195 --> 02:46:09.756]  We're good to go.
[02:46:09.796 --> 02:46:10.076]  I think?
[02:46:29.733 --> 02:46:31.313]  With John Quincy Adams.
[02:46:31.553 --> 02:46:32.494]  Well, what was it?
[02:46:32.554 --> 02:46:34.934]  John Quincy Adams was anti-Masonic.
[02:46:35.314 --> 02:46:42.796]  John Quincy Adams, because of the European Illuminati taking over masonry, and this is the president, folks, had it banned.
[02:46:43.236 --> 02:46:53.759]  And that's why, according to MSNBC, who interviewed 100 Skull and Bones members at Yale, they sent German money over to take over Yale as a base to take America over.
[02:46:54.614 --> 02:47:01.416]  Now, that's what Bush has in common, is that the Skull and Bones cult helped take America over for the New World Order.
[02:47:01.856 --> 02:47:02.196]  Yeah.
[02:47:02.616 --> 02:47:07.798]  John Quincy Adams said the oath of Freemasonry is contrary to the laws of God and the laws of the land.
[02:47:08.138 --> 02:47:15.180]  So, therefore, being that Webster's Unified Dictionary calls it a cult, we should use the Monroe Doctrine to counter the cult of Freemasonry.
[02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:16.320]  Thanks for the call, Spencer.
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:17.120]  I'll just say this.
[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:22.322]  At the higher levels of Masonry, it's the same as the Skull and Bones oath.
[02:47:22.842 --> 02:47:23.682]  You have to promise...
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:39.109]  To cut the entrails out of anybody, to hang anybody, to strangle anybody that you're ordered to, any fellow Mason that lets out any secrets, you have to promise to strangle your wife with her intestines after cutting her open if you're ordered to do so.
[02:47:40.249 --> 02:47:41.690]  That's what they do, folks.
[02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:45.813]  But again, the average Mason is low-level, like Davy Crockett or George Washington.
[02:47:46.153 --> 02:47:47.514]  They never got into higher degrees.
[02:47:47.554 --> 02:47:48.294]  They were good men.
[02:47:48.774 --> 02:47:50.055]  They go after good people.
[02:47:50.095 --> 02:47:51.296]  They want to suck you in.
[02:47:52.317 --> 02:47:52.897]  So it's not...
[02:47:53.599 --> 02:47:56.461]  Again, folks, some people say it's the Masons, it's the Catholic Church.
[02:47:56.521 --> 02:47:57.942]  No, it's the Jews running it.
[02:47:57.982 --> 02:48:00.043]  No, it's the WASP.
[02:48:01.084 --> 02:48:03.405]  Folks, it's evil people in all groups.
[02:48:04.165 --> 02:48:09.969]  And these groups want to make everything racial or group-oriented so you can't criticize these organizations.
[02:48:10.009 --> 02:48:21.896]  But all these big organizations, whether it's the NRA or the ACLU or the Masons or those running Israel who killed Yishak Rabin because he wouldn't follow orders...
[02:48:22.637 --> 02:48:23.818]  These are the evil people.
[02:48:24.078 --> 02:48:25.418]  Evil people!
[02:48:26.139 --> 02:48:27.839]  Regardless of what color they are.
[02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:29.760]  It's just that simple.
[02:48:30.260 --> 02:48:31.961]  We've got to fight against those evil people.
[02:48:32.762 --> 02:48:34.883]  Tough new tactics by U.S.
[02:48:35.563 --> 02:48:37.724]  Titan grip on Iraq towns.
[02:48:39.565 --> 02:48:40.825]  This is out of the New York Times.
[02:48:42.206 --> 02:48:51.410]  As the guerrilla war against Iraqi insurgents intensifies, American soldiers have begun wrapping entire villages in barbed wire.
[02:48:52.503 --> 02:48:57.546]  In selective cases, American soldiers are demolishing buildings thought to be used by Iraqi attackers.
[02:48:58.487 --> 02:48:59.727]  See, that's Israeli tactics.
[02:48:59.787 --> 02:49:02.869]  And by the way, I have an article here admitting Israel's there running all this.
[02:49:03.550 --> 02:49:06.712]  They have begun imprisoning the relatives of suspected guerrillas.
[02:49:06.932 --> 02:49:08.533]  Now, the Nazis did that, see?
[02:49:09.353 --> 02:49:10.814]  Arresting children and women.
[02:49:10.934 --> 02:49:14.596]  Oh, you're going to pay because we think your husband did something wrong.
[02:49:14.656 --> 02:49:15.877]  Notice, suspect.
[02:49:16.437 --> 02:49:22.021]  They have begun imprisoning the relatives of suspected guerrillas in hopes of pressing the insurgents to turn themselves in.
[02:49:23.297 --> 02:49:25.919]  Folks, that is so illegal, so criminal, so bad.
[02:49:26.419 --> 02:49:34.884]  The Americans embarked on their get tough strategy in early November, goaded by what proved to be the deadliest month yet for American forces in Iraq.
[02:49:35.484 --> 02:49:44.949]  With 81 soldiers killed by hostile fire, the response they chose is beginning to echo the Israeli counterinsurgency campaign in occupied territories.
[02:49:46.470 --> 02:49:48.251]  Kidnapping people's children, folks.
[02:49:48.431 --> 02:49:49.652]  How can you say that's good?
[02:49:50.766 --> 02:49:59.477]  So far, the new approach appears to be succeeding in diminishing the threat to American soldiers, but it appears to be coming at a cost of alienating many of the people the Americans are trying to win over.
[02:50:00.098 --> 02:50:04.123]  Abu Hishma is quiet now, but he is angry too.
[02:50:06.224 --> 02:50:09.247]  And it says if you have one of these cards, you can come and go.
[02:50:09.747 --> 02:50:12.890]  Coaxed Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Sassman.
[02:50:12.910 --> 02:50:14.251]  See, they have their national ID cards.
[02:50:14.672 --> 02:50:18.235]  The battalion commander and his men oversee the village about 50 miles north of Baghdad.
[02:50:18.255 --> 02:50:20.217]  If you don't have one of these cards, you can't.
[02:50:20.717 --> 02:50:24.421]  The Iraqis knotted and edged their cards.
[02:50:25.101 --> 02:50:33.869]  Through the line, over to one side, an Iraqi man named Tarki muttered in anger, I see no difference between us and the Palestinians, he said.
[02:50:33.929 --> 02:50:36.892]  We didn't expect anything like this after Saddam fell.
[02:50:38.734 --> 02:50:41.977]  And our news says torture's good, and they're kidnapping people's children.
[02:50:42.717 --> 02:50:44.379]  We're wearing the black hats, folks!
[02:50:46.192 --> 02:50:50.536]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.736 --> 02:50:55.141]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:55.301 --> 02:50:59.665]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:50:59.725 --> 02:51:01.067]  The New World Order.
[02:51:01.847 --> 02:51:02.428]  Can emerge.
[02:51:02.849 --> 02:51:07.074]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:07.134 --> 02:51:14.082]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:14.202 --> 02:51:16.205]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.604 --> 02:51:26.907]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:27.187 --> 02:51:32.569]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:51:45.693 --> 02:51:47.334]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:51:47.354 --> 02:51:49.876]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:52:13.792 --> 02:52:15.513]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[02:52:15.774 --> 02:52:27.723]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[02:52:27.903 --> 02:52:34.408]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[02:52:34.488 --> 02:52:35.749]  This is Michael Corbin, host of A Closer Look.
[02:52:35.769 --> 02:52:36.889]  Now you can hear more of a good thing.
[02:52:36.909 --> 02:52:40.051]  Beginning Monday, November 17th, we are expanding our daily program to two hours.
[02:52:54.827 --> 02:52:55.407]  We're good to go.
[02:53:15.310 --> 02:53:18.711]  A closer look puts you in the driver's seat by keeping you informed.
[02:53:19.251 --> 02:53:29.555]  Our program, combined with other programs on this network, such as Alex Jones, strives to present a united front on the war against corruption being perpetrated by our politicians.
[02:53:30.095 --> 02:53:34.196]  We provide you the means to halt their assault so we can take our country back.
[02:53:34.797 --> 02:53:37.057]  So join me Monday through Saturday, 6 to 8 p.m.
[02:53:37.097 --> 02:53:41.139]  Mountain, 8 to 10 Eastern, right here on the Genesis Communications Network.
[02:53:41.599 --> 02:53:41.959]  Be there.
[02:53:48.812 --> 02:53:52.154]  We're good to go.
[02:54:14.758 --> 02:54:22.886]  Former House, excuse me, Speaker Newt Gingrich, a quiet confidant of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, says the U.S.
[02:54:22.946 --> 02:54:24.227]  went off a cliff in Iraq.
[02:54:24.247 --> 02:54:29.312]  That's a quote in the December 15th issue on newsstands today.
[02:54:29.412 --> 02:54:37.940]  Gingrich talks about the shortcomings of the Bush administration policy in Iraq, saying that Americans can't win in Iraq, only Iraqis can win in Iraq.
[02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:57.646]  Gingrich is a member of the Influential Defense Policy Board, argues that the administration has taken far too much emphasis on the military solution, and they are sliding the political element, report the national security correspondent, John Berry, and assistant managing editor, Evan Thomas.
[02:54:59.153 --> 02:55:07.214]  And he says, while he's not speaking for the entire board, it is rare that one of the members' voices is a dissenting view in public.
[02:55:07.715 --> 02:55:15.036]  The Army's reaction to Vietnam was not to think about it, he says, rather than absorb the lessons of counterinsurgency, Gendrich says.
[02:55:15.376 --> 02:55:21.497]  The Army adopted a deliberate strategy of amnesia because people don't want to ever do it again.
[02:55:21.997 --> 02:55:25.938]  The Army rebuilt a superb fighting force for waging a conventional war.
[02:55:26.338 --> 02:55:27.718]  I am very proud of what
[02:55:28.752 --> 02:55:32.094]  Operation Iraqi Martial Law Franks did.
[02:55:32.114 --> 02:55:33.435]  I added that martial law part.
[02:55:34.315 --> 02:55:40.319]  Up until the moment of deciding how to transfer power to the Iraqis, then we go off a cliff.
[02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:53.106]  And in some of the other news here, news of bizarre deaths, Harrison crash at airport kills two whitewater figure pilots.
[02:55:53.775 --> 02:55:54.856]  Harrison, Arkansas.
[02:55:54.876 --> 02:55:56.096]  This is the Associated Press.
[02:55:56.436 --> 02:56:08.022]  A two-seat single-engine beach plane crashed about 1,000 feet short of the Boone County Regional Airport runway Thursday morning, killing the 72-year-old pilot John H. Haley.
[02:56:08.982 --> 02:56:10.983]  Haley, a lawyer for Governor...
[02:56:12.274 --> 02:56:19.781]  Jim Guy Tucker, an ex-chairman of the state's prison board with all the tainted HIV blood, remember that, was involved in the Whitewater scandal.
[02:56:19.841 --> 02:56:26.607]  Also killed was Farish Kincaid, 70, of North Little Rock, who was along on a business trip.
[02:56:26.667 --> 02:56:32.632]  Boone County Sheriff Danny Hickman said Haley had a car rented at about 10 a.m.
[02:56:32.672 --> 02:56:33.493]  until 1 p.m.
[02:56:33.533 --> 02:56:39.078]  when he was due to fly back to Little Rock, according to Judy McCutcheon, airport manager.
[02:56:40.110 --> 02:56:51.935]  In 1995, a federal grand jury indicted Haley, Tucker, and Williams, J. Marks, for concocting a sham bankruptcy to avoid paying taxes on the sale of Florida cable television system in the 1980s.
[02:56:51.975 --> 02:56:58.398]  Haley pleaded guilty in 1998 to a misdemeanor charge and paid $40,000 in restitution.
[02:56:59.898 --> 02:57:05.201]  And he also cooperated with Whitewater investigators in exchange for probation and a fine.
[02:57:05.261 --> 02:57:08.102]  State investigators later dropped efforts to disbar him.
[02:57:09.645 --> 02:57:12.148]  And it goes on and on with him involved with the scams with Clinton.
[02:57:12.909 --> 02:57:14.470]  Another bizarre death.
[02:57:15.031 --> 02:57:16.052]  We're almost out of time here.
[02:57:16.392 --> 02:57:20.337]  Top secret advisor to four presidents who dies violently in D.C.
[02:57:20.917 --> 02:57:22.299]  Gus W.Y.
[02:57:22.459 --> 02:57:27.004]  72, advisor to four presidents on top secret policy matters, died violently in Washington, D.C.
[02:57:27.024 --> 02:57:31.288]  on November 25th, but his death was not reported by the Washington Post until December 7th.
[02:57:32.353 --> 02:57:46.926]  In the obituary section of the bottom page of C-12, his hometown newspaper, the Nashville Tennessean, was only a week late in reporting his death, but at the time of the date, all they would say was the circumstances surrounding his death could not be confirmed this night.
[02:57:47.486 --> 02:57:57.715]  Reading on the news articles, it looks like he'd been saying he was against the Iraq War, and it looks like he was murdered.
[02:57:59.173 --> 02:58:01.095]  And many are shocked by his death.
[02:58:01.535 --> 02:58:04.977]  Again, I'll have to cover more of this tomorrow or back from 9 to midnight tonight.
[02:58:05.598 --> 02:58:16.225]  I'll be in Houston the 13th this Saturday showing Road to Tyranny and They Live from 6 to midnight at the Alamo Drafthouse West Oak Shopping Center.

[02:58:29.278 --> 02:58:29.980]  I'm out of time.
[02:58:30.101 --> 02:58:32.106]  Thanks to all the sponsors and affiliates and listeners.
[02:58:32.387 --> 02:58:33.210]  God bless you all.
[02:58:36.537 --> 02:58:45.162]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:58:45.362 --> 02:58:56.649]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:58:56.869 --> 02:58:59.510]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:58:59.851 --> 02:59:03.953]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:59:04.073 --> 02:59:04.613]  We're good to go.
[02:59:27.458 --> 02:59:27.538]  803-4438.
[02:59:27.598 --> 02:59:28.439]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:59:28.699 --> 02:59:29.540]  Not yet available in Iowa.
