[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.899]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:15.978]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.618 --> 00:00:17.679]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:19.540]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.960]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.601]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:26.944]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.484 --> 00:00:31.607]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:40.472]  Live from Austin, Texas,
[00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:48.217]  Thanks for joining us today, or tonight or this morning, depending on what time zone you're listening to us in.
[00:00:48.257 --> 00:01:01.202]  It is already the 22nd of July, 2003, on this live Tuesday edition of the Worldwide Show, as we expose the globalist crime rings and their pomps and what they're up to.
[00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:04.203]  Big, big show lined up for you.
[00:01:04.383 --> 00:01:06.504]  You'll definitely want to stay with us.
[00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:10.346]  Torture testimony acceptable.
[00:01:11.047 --> 00:01:11.587]  We're good to go.
[00:01:11.607 --> 00:01:11.747]  I think?
[00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:31.442]  You cannot trust confessions from torture.
[00:01:31.562 --> 00:01:34.723]  You cannot trust a government that will torture people.
[00:01:35.343 --> 00:01:46.367]  Or you'll have to rethink your views on our airmen being tortured by the North Vietnamese or by Hitler or what Joseph Mengele did in the death camps in Nazi Germany.
[00:01:48.047 --> 00:01:54.409]  Or you can hold both ideas at the same time in your mind and be a good neocon as part of the double think system.
[00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.310]  So coming up, torture...
[00:01:57.199 --> 00:02:03.883]  Is acceptable, expert tells terror panel, hearing that MI5 would use information obtained under duress in court.
[00:02:04.984 --> 00:02:09.447]  Also, Ashcroft yesterday on national television, and I can't keep track of it all.
[00:02:09.527 --> 00:02:11.848]  If you've got video of it, please send it to me.
[00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:19.673]  Ashcroft denies USA Patriot Act and defends it and says that it doesn't take your rights.
[00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:22.695]  So we went ahead and went to the Justice Department's own policy report.
[00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:33.903]  By Ashcroft, not even the report that's critical, but a report that he gave before Congress where they admit it will be used for all crimes against all citizens and does get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:35.964]  So this is from Reuters.
[00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:38.326]  Ashcroft defends USA Patriot Act.
[00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:40.387]  Another story out of the New York Times.
[00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:43.329]  Report on USA Patriot Act alleges civil rights violations.
[00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:44.630]  But forget that.
[00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.511]  I've got the Anchorage Daily News.
[00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:52.115]  Tougher Patriot Act, Attorney General says, and calls for more power and an expansion.
[00:02:52.935 --> 00:03:15.532]  And then I went back, and we're doing a flashback for you on Infowars.com, Patriot Act of 2001, cast wide net, where the Justice Department's own report to Congress that was televised, where they admit just a few weeks ago, about a month and a half ago, that it is for all citizens and all crimes.
[00:03:15.572 --> 00:03:18.014]  So we're going to go over that for you and show the lies...
[00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:21.898]  And then we'll get into proposals to North Korea.
[00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:22.318]  U.S.
[00:03:22.378 --> 00:03:24.401]  might offer no attack pledge.
[00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:26.483]  Well, that's good news.
[00:03:26.983 --> 00:03:27.664]  We'll get into that.
[00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:33.531]  Also, FBI denies failing to spot September 11th plot, but the report says they did.
[00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:35.587]  Also, Bush approval hits 59.
[00:03:36.247 --> 00:03:37.968]  Democrats give an edge on the economy.
[00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:39.728]  Again, a controlled paradigm.
[00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:41.169]  Doesn't matter who's in power.
[00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.510]  They're all New World Order up there.
[00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.531]  Continuing, report FBI informants knew of 9-1-1 hijackers.
[00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:48.072]  This from the Associated Press.
[00:03:48.112 --> 00:03:50.553]  Well, we told you this before 9-1-1.
[00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:51.814]  We warned you of the plot.
[00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:55.055]  Everybody who had a brain already knew it was happening.
[00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:58.756]  This show knew, and we warned the people on the record.
[00:03:59.637 --> 00:04:02.138]  So there's another MSNBC exclusive.
[00:04:02.984 --> 00:04:04.185]  Yeah, right, an exclusive.
[00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:07.826]  The 9-1-1 report slamming the FBI has now been released.
[00:04:09.107 --> 00:04:11.868]  War incorporated on the march to relieve U.S.
[00:04:11.948 --> 00:04:12.289]  troops.
[00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.591]  It says the mercenaries wear black uniforms and masks, and they're private.
[00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:20.713]  DynCorp and other companies will talk about DynCorp and the things they're up to.
[00:04:21.693 --> 00:04:25.275]  Another story here, Pentagon seeking private security firm to police Iraq.
[00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:26.532]  U.S.
[00:04:26.592 --> 00:04:29.495]  is creating an Iraqi militia to relieve G.I.s.
[00:04:30.295 --> 00:04:30.575]  U.S.
[00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:32.537]  plan to enlist Iraqis in operation.
[00:04:32.577 --> 00:04:34.839]  Civil force intended to quell resistance.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.643]  Also, construction of nuclear reactors in North Korea ongoing to spike tension.
[00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:42.204]  Yeah, they keep talking about these reactors.
[00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:43.565]  Our government's building them.
[00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:47.468]  Not out of the Associated Press.
[00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:51.511]  Also, lawsuit claims troopers have ticket quotas.
[00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:52.372]  Oh, that's admitted.
[00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:54.714]  Mistakes admitted in South Carolina...
[00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.163]  Mental jail stays.
[00:04:57.203 --> 00:04:58.084]  Wait to hear about this.
[00:04:58.804 --> 00:05:01.007]  Sharp rise in children's Ritalin use.
[00:05:01.888 --> 00:05:04.510]  They're giving it to 15-month-olds now.
[00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:06.733]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:06.913 --> 00:05:07.794]  Big show.
[00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:08.935]  Please stay with us.
[00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:11.936]  Let the experts at startovertoday.com
[00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:39.525]  We're good to go.
[00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:09.342]  Don't consolidate, eliminate.
[00:06:10.924 --> 00:06:18.289]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.313]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:29.177]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:33.959]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:41.321]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:45.863]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:06:46.043 --> 00:06:48.544]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:06:48.784 --> 00:06:55.486]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:06:55.726 --> 00:07:00.995]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:01.416]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:19.807]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:24.451]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:27.614]  There are no moving parts, and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[00:07:27.895 --> 00:07:32.459]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:36.682]  Made of the finest materials, it has a two-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[00:07:36.942 --> 00:07:39.324]  And the Aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[00:07:39.604 --> 00:07:43.527]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[00:07:43.727 --> 00:07:48.931]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds, and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[00:07:49.132 --> 00:07:52.074]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[00:07:52.234 --> 00:07:54.115]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[00:07:54.335 --> 00:07:56.977]  For more information about the Aeronizer, call toll-free.
[00:07:57.218 --> 00:07:58.939]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:00.479]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:02.300]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.301]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:36.420]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time during the day, and then of course back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time as well with a rebroadcast of the daytime show from 1 a.m.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.561]  until 4 a.m.
[00:08:38.442 --> 00:08:40.083]  weeknights as well.
[00:08:40.123 --> 00:08:46.849]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, and yes, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:50.074 --> 00:08:50.694]  Where to begin?
[00:08:50.734 --> 00:09:02.781]  There is so much to cover, and I'm going to go straight into news today and kind of skip the diatribe or monologue or rant, as some would say, as I would say.
[00:09:02.801 --> 00:09:14.308]  I already mentioned this in the last intro segment, but we're going to get into Ashcroft in the same speech saying he wants to expand the Patriot Act.
[00:09:14.968 --> 00:09:17.570]  Yesterday up in Alaska when he was there visiting,
[00:09:20.189 --> 00:09:25.994]  And then claiming that it doesn't take any of your liberties and that it's all lies to say that it does.
[00:09:26.094 --> 00:09:33.981]  Well, I've read Patriot Act I and Patriot Act II, and Ashcroft tried to deny that Patriot Act II even existed.
[00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:37.985]  Then he had to admit that it did, and it had been introduced in the House and Senate.
[00:09:38.465 --> 00:09:41.248]  Then he said, yeah, let's go ahead and expand it a few weeks ago.
[00:09:41.268 --> 00:09:45.832]  His own Justice Department admits enthusiastically before Congress...
[00:09:46.812 --> 00:09:59.288]  That they just love it and that they're going to use it in all crimes against all citizens for any reason on a hundred fronts that have nothing to do with fighting terrorism, the boogeyman excuse that they've been using in the past.
[00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:07.162]  And yesterday he said that it doesn't take any of your rights, and those that are saying it are undermining the republic.
[00:10:07.282 --> 00:10:11.023]  Well, you're the one undermining the republic, but of course, you're not really running anything.
[00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:16.704]  You're just a frontman, senator, attorney general, Mr. Puppet Ashcroft.
[00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:24.046]  And on top of that, the British government has said, we don't want our businessmen back who are obviously innocent.
[00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:30.707]  We don't want our special forces soldiers back that are in your custody that you just rounded up randomly off the streets of Afghanistan.
[00:10:31.939 --> 00:10:54.475]  Because if any of the people being held there that are British citizens get brought back to England from Camp X-Ray and Camp Delta in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the evidence against them will be inadmissible because it was obtained under torture and duress and without them being able to see lawyers or their names even being released in many cases.
[00:10:55.942 --> 00:10:57.883]  And there's been this big debate about torture.
[00:10:57.943 --> 00:11:09.010]  They've been on Fox and CNN and all the big channels saying that torture's good and that maybe the government should go ahead and torture terrorist suspects' children to get answers.
[00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:15.354]  We have news articles and video clips in Police State 3 with them saying this in dozens of news articles.
[00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:24.960]  And then every time we talk about it and how it's wrong, they then, some people that said torture was good will claim, we've never tortured anybody, shut up, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:33.271]  It's this new propaganda tactic of saying one thing in the speech and another thing in the same speech and then saying just accept it.
[00:11:33.551 --> 00:11:42.673]  It's a psychological warfare tactic that's very sophisticated, and I've gone into it in the past, but it takes 30 minutes to even basically give some details of.
[00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:47.934]  But you can break it down for yourself with your native intelligence and understand what's going on here.
[00:11:47.954 --> 00:11:51.855]  They're just training you to accept 2 plus 2 equals 5 or 4 or 3 or 8.
[00:11:51.995 --> 00:11:52.695]  It doesn't matter.
[00:11:55.286 --> 00:12:04.010]  And they have admitted, the government admits that at least two people were tortured to death at Bagram Air Base by the CIA interrogators and said, oh, oh, we're sorry, we won't do that anymore.
[00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.832]  And they admit that people are being tortured at Camp X-Ray.
[00:12:07.332 --> 00:12:19.398]  I mean, when they put a mask and mouth guard over you and goggles and earplugs and chained down in a kneeling position with your feet behind your gluteus maximus,
[00:12:20.118 --> 00:12:24.781]  That's an admitted form of torture, excruciatingly painful in just a few minutes.
[00:12:25.182 --> 00:12:26.783]  Why don't you go ahead and try it?
[00:12:27.203 --> 00:12:36.349]  Even if you're a person who's an athlete who's big and stretching or even someone who's into yoga, you know that that is extremely painful.
[00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:42.933]  It's what the Israelis admit they use to torture people, sleep deprivation, a bag over the head.
[00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:45.215]  It's worse with earplugs or a face guard.
[00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:47.146]  We're good to go.
[00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:47.826]  We're good to go.
[00:13:00.931 --> 00:13:02.894]  Delta being the subgroup of Camp X-Ray.
[00:13:03.274 --> 00:13:04.676]  Mosquitoes, they reported.
[00:13:05.277 --> 00:13:13.307]  The troops, you can see photos of them wearing mosquito hats and gloves and putting repellent all over themselves.
[00:13:13.447 --> 00:13:14.589]  Low morale for the troops.
[00:13:14.729 --> 00:13:17.112]  Imagine being an open-air hen.
[00:13:18.771 --> 00:13:33.638]  Defecating in a small hole in the ground, living in your affluent with mosquitoes in mobs, bleeding and biting you with a mask over your head, and some have died and they claim it was suicide.
[00:13:33.658 --> 00:13:38.040]  A hundred of the 500-plus have, quote, tried to commit suicide.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.181]  I mean, I believe some of them have tried.
[00:13:40.221 --> 00:13:41.021]  I mean, who wouldn't?
[00:13:42.702 --> 00:13:44.643]  We're now coming up on over a year of this.
[00:13:45.982 --> 00:13:49.865]  Over a year of this, and you're like, hey, they're Al-Qaeda, they get whatever they deserve.
[00:13:49.925 --> 00:13:55.929]  Well, folks, then I guess our troops deserved it in Vietnam, and the answer is no, or in North Korea, no.
[00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.352]  That's exactly what they did to our troops, was put them in cages!
[00:14:00.993 --> 00:14:02.274]  Open-air cages!
[00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:15.119]  And it was wrong when it happened to our troops, and it's wrong and evil now, and the world is seeing this, and the globalist newspapers in Europe are demonizing us, the American people, for this.
[00:14:15.139 --> 00:14:17.080]  That's part of the globalist plan.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.964]  The European banks and monarchies and bankers own our government, own our military.
[00:14:22.184 --> 00:14:23.204]  They carry this out.
[00:14:23.545 --> 00:14:24.705]  Our media says it's good.
[00:14:24.725 --> 00:14:32.931]  We feel all content and partake in the evil psychologically, enter into evil as the neocons say they want us to do in Ron Paul's own speech.
[00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:42.819]  And then worldwide we're being demonized as the owners of America are using us for the dirty work while making the Euro and the UN look like good guys.
[00:14:44.141 --> 00:14:44.681]  It's horrible.
[00:14:46.483 --> 00:14:50.506]  And, you know, we had Ann Coulter on, and she denied the torture when it's been in 100 newspapers.
[00:14:51.347 --> 00:14:52.648]  Positive articles about it.
[00:14:52.688 --> 00:14:54.089]  Well, here it is out of London Guardian.
[00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:58.813]  In court, open court, they're saying torture's good, okay?
[00:14:58.934 --> 00:15:00.375]  I've seen Ashcroft on video.
[00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.752]  Saying on TV that they're torturing them, that it's good.
[00:15:04.693 --> 00:15:06.394]  Torture testimony acceptable.
[00:15:06.794 --> 00:15:13.039]  Expert tells terror appeals hearing that MI5 could use information obtained under duress in court.
[00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:21.845]  MI5 expert in terrorism has admitted that the security service would use information extracted from tortured prisoners as evidence in court.
[00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:35.205]  The secret witnesses told a panel of judges that in spite of knowledge that a victim had been tortured or had come from a country where the regime sanctioned torture, she would still consider their testimony to be relevant to security service investigations.
[00:15:36.986 --> 00:15:46.170]  The AP's reported, the CIA section chief of Central Asia has reported, and has bragged that they are taken to Egypt, they are taken to Jordan, they are taken to Israel.
[00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.031]  Just two weeks ago, there was another AP article about Israel.
[00:15:49.071 --> 00:15:52.172]  They admitted they are taken to a secret facility.
[00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:58.354]  Sleep deprivation, denial of food and water, they are chained down, they are hung up by their arms.
[00:15:58.414 --> 00:15:59.515]  Oh, I forgot that part, too.
[00:16:00.362 --> 00:16:03.424]  There's photos of people hanging by their arms for days.
[00:16:03.524 --> 00:16:12.910]  Now, the average American watches that and then reads the headline, or the reporter, the newsreader says, is it torture to do this?
[00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.451]  Well, of course it is.
[00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:21.835]  Hey, why don't you try hanging yourself up by ropes or chains for a day or so?
[00:16:22.155 --> 00:16:23.896]  Why don't you try it for five minutes?
[00:16:23.956 --> 00:16:26.198]  You'll be in excruciating pain.
[00:16:27.478 --> 00:16:28.959]  This is classical torture.
[00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:35.902]  You know, the old image of the long, gray-haired man hanging up by leg and arm irons in the dungeon.
[00:16:36.743 --> 00:16:45.827]  This is what they did to the Christians in Rome, and it's happening right out in plain view, and the whole country's partaking in this evil.
[00:16:47.828 --> 00:16:48.309]  It goes on.
[00:16:48.349 --> 00:16:53.051]  The admission will add to growing public concern over the detainees at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
[00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:56.090]  Who were questioned by the CIA and MIFI officers.
[00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.591]  Critics claim that the government has condoned torture.
[00:16:58.611 --> 00:16:59.391]  They admit it.
[00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:08.395]  But the U.S., in its attempts to garner evidence against people it suspects of having been involved in Al-Qaeda or the Taliban.
[00:17:09.275 --> 00:17:15.078]  Now, the real Taliban and Al-Qaeda, in my film, Rotary, I say 6,000, because that's what we had in the news articles then.
[00:17:15.698 --> 00:17:18.699]  The Yorker Magazine, Times of London, AP, MSNBC.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.340]  Now they admit...
[00:17:21.392 --> 00:17:27.793]  8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda flown out to safety, and Fox News reported it and said, oh, well, the CIA made a mistake.
[00:17:27.953 --> 00:17:31.894]  And then generals who aren't part of the New World Order blew the whistle and, of course, got removed.
[00:17:32.194 --> 00:17:33.234]  And that was in the news here.
[00:17:33.574 --> 00:17:40.216]  Just a few places here and there, never a big news item, that they would have top Taliban generals, and they'd be ordered by the CIA to release them.
[00:17:40.576 --> 00:17:45.056]  They'd be loaded into trucks, paid by our government in gold bars, and they'd disappear.
[00:17:45.877 --> 00:17:47.957]  Same thing with the Iraqi leaders, and that's on the record.
[00:17:48.837 --> 00:17:52.318]  So don't say, oh, it's just torture for Taliban or Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:52.978 --> 00:17:53.378]  No, no, no.
[00:17:53.798 --> 00:17:56.599]  They're grabbing 15-year-old kids, 85-year-old men.
[00:17:57.079 --> 00:18:01.480]  This is admitted, folks, and taking them and torturing them and killing them in many cases.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.341]  And I remember in Road to Tyranny, I talked about secret execution.
[00:18:06.381 --> 00:18:09.282]  It was in Patriot Act I. I talked about it at Camp X-Ray.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.382]  And I talked about it in Patriot Act 2 analysis.
[00:18:12.502 --> 00:18:13.883]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:18:14.223 --> 00:18:18.486]  And I got emails and calls going, where'd you get this about secret execution?
[00:18:18.946 --> 00:18:19.726]  I don't believe it.
[00:18:20.707 --> 00:18:22.028]  Well, now you don't say that.
[00:18:22.608 --> 00:18:25.030]  You don't even have to read my analysis or go look at the U.S.
[00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.290]  Code.
[00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.012]  You can be lazy and turn on the nightly news.
[00:18:28.032 --> 00:18:34.836]  There's been hundreds of reports, again, hundreds, about the execution chambers, about the secret execution plans.
[00:18:35.597 --> 00:18:38.699]  So, see, that's now out in the open and kind of passee.
[00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:40.710]  All of this is passe now.
[00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.191]  Oh yeah, torture, I heard about that.
[00:18:42.612 --> 00:18:44.553]  Oh yeah, secret executions, I heard about that.
[00:18:46.395 --> 00:19:04.570]  But what you've got to get through your brain is, I have the spokesman for the Justice Department before Congress a month ago saying, and it's posted on Infowars.com right now, right now, right now,
[00:19:05.558 --> 00:19:11.980]  It's posted, saying it will be used for all crimes, misdemeanors, against all citizens in all criminal investigations.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.221]  Patriot Act 1 and 2 will be used.
[00:19:15.281 --> 00:19:19.182]  No juries, snatch and grab off the street, never seen again.
[00:19:19.923 --> 00:19:24.784]  They're hiring private Merck teams to do it internationally and domestically.
[00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:27.305]  And that's where the black masks come in and no badges.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.943]  Folks, they are publicly, they have to publicly do this so their police and military think it's okay.
[00:19:33.963 --> 00:19:36.424]  Because if it's on the news, well, it must be all right.
[00:19:36.824 --> 00:19:43.628]  They're standardizing criminality in front of you and then having the debate about the Patriot Act be about foreigners.
[00:19:45.128 --> 00:19:46.849]  And, oh, it's just for those illegal aliens.
[00:19:46.869 --> 00:19:46.909]  No.
[00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.730]  It's for citizens.
[00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:50.571]  So we'll cover that.
[00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:52.132]  We'll cover that.
[00:19:52.859 --> 00:20:04.772]  From the Associated Press, from Reuters, from the New York Times, from the Anchorage Daily News, and from the Washington Times, when we get back.
[00:20:05.012 --> 00:20:09.277]  Official admissions by the Justice Department.
[00:20:12.563 --> 00:20:13.103]  It's here.
[00:20:13.363 --> 00:20:14.084]  It's powerful.
[00:20:14.384 --> 00:20:22.967]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.267 --> 00:20:25.108]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[00:20:25.368 --> 00:20:27.469]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:31.951]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:37.953]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[00:20:38.153 --> 00:20:39.894]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[00:20:40.074 --> 00:20:43.275]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[00:20:43.495 --> 00:20:45.055]  Get the powerful Berkey now.
[00:20:45.315 --> 00:20:51.876]  Ideal for everyday use, for outdoor sporting events, and in the event of a local or national emergency, you'll be prepared.
[00:20:52.216 --> 00:20:52.596]  Normally $279.

[00:20:56.857 --> 00:20:57.257]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:20:57.357 --> 00:20:59.657]  Not yet available in California and Iowa.
[00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:16.800]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:21:17.041 --> 00:21:19.284]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:21:46.917 --> 00:21:47.117]  I think?
[00:22:08.513 --> 00:22:12.335]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[00:22:12.635 --> 00:22:19.578]  Use a Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and a Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.
[00:22:19.859 --> 00:22:21.379]  Take control of your own destiny.
[00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:26.022]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[00:22:26.182 --> 00:22:27.462]  This is more than a handbook.
[00:22:27.642 --> 00:22:30.964]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[00:22:31.344 --> 00:22:32.065]  Here's the deal.
[00:22:32.285 --> 00:22:43.558]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:50.086]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918 and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[00:22:51.147 --> 00:22:55.993]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[00:22:56.313 --> 00:22:58.276]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:02.421]  Ask for the Freedom Handbook Special.
[00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:04.123]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:07.507 --> 00:23:09.148]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:23:09.248 --> 00:23:11.711]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:12.612]  It feels great.
[00:23:12.772 --> 00:23:13.793]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:23:13.933 --> 00:23:16.015]  I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:23:16.095 --> 00:23:18.918]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:23:18.998 --> 00:23:19.678]  Incredible.
[00:23:25.484 --> 00:23:26.686]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:23:26.726 --> 00:23:30.370]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.115]  Sharon lost 28 pounds with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:23:34.135 --> 00:23:40.883]  I have arthritis, and I have a thyroid problem and blood pressure, and Vim and Vigor has really been a blessing to me.
[00:23:41.183 --> 00:23:41.524]  I've lost
[00:23:42.224 --> 00:23:43.525]  28 pounds and counting.
[00:23:43.926 --> 00:23:46.787]  And I thank them very much from the bottom of my heart.
[00:23:47.168 --> 00:23:51.791]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:53.372]  Call right now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:23:53.392 --> 00:23:54.032]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:23:54.052 --> 00:23:55.213]  $25 off a three-month supply.
[00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:57.314]  So call Vim and Vigor today, 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:23:57.434 --> 00:23:58.375]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:24:26.291 --> 00:24:43.725]  Yesterday in the third hour, I read about 80%, 90% of Congressman Ron Paul's 45-minute speech that he gave before Congress 12 days ago, where he detailed from their own published writings of the Vice President and others...
[00:24:45.134 --> 00:25:05.758]  The plan to invade countries before 9-1-1, how they said they needed a terrorist to get the people behind this New World Order, where he detailed how they are actually the fourth international founded by the Trotskyites, how they are expanding government and destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution, how they said that the public had to be trained to, quote, enter into evil.
[00:25:07.782 --> 00:25:09.303]  Everything we've broken down here.
[00:25:09.363 --> 00:25:11.464]  They're training the society how to be evil.
[00:25:11.984 --> 00:25:13.745]  They're exploding the size of government.
[00:25:13.825 --> 00:25:15.206]  They love the welfare state.
[00:25:15.246 --> 00:25:20.208]  Ron Paul said that using their own quotes from their own publications.
[00:25:21.949 --> 00:25:33.375]  And by carrying out September 11th, the globalists are able now to condition you through fear to keep your way of life, which is going to be the opposite of what happens.
[00:25:34.082 --> 00:25:40.224]  You're going to lose everything you've got, but they're telling you, go along with what we say, get rid of the Bill of Rights, give up liberty for so-called security.
[00:25:41.004 --> 00:25:45.065]  They're doing it right now, and telling you that torture is good in mainstream newspapers, okay?
[00:25:45.785 --> 00:25:46.766]  In court, they're saying it.
[00:25:49.246 --> 00:25:52.187]  And then Ashcroft says there's no Patriot Act, too, and then admits there is.
[00:25:52.227 --> 00:25:55.628]  This is Ashcroft in Anchorage, Alaska, yesterday.
[00:25:55.648 --> 00:25:56.588]  This is from Reuters.
[00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:59.629]  And again, if you tape this, please send it to me.
[00:25:59.709 --> 00:26:02.170]  I can't watch it all or keep track of it all.
[00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.730]  I need your help.
[00:26:04.236 --> 00:26:06.659]  Ashcroft defends USA Patriot Act.
[00:26:06.699 --> 00:26:18.070]  Attorney General John Ashcroft on Monday defended the USA Patriot Act, saying, Criticism of the sweeping federal anti-terrorist law was based on exaggerations and falsehoods.
[00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:19.792]  Now, you're the liar.
[00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:27.980]  Ashcroft told a news conference it was understandable that the public was concerned about the possible invasion of privacy, but when the so-called invasion...
[00:26:28.875 --> 00:26:35.917]  Is one that's falsely reported and non-existent, and they don't hear about the fact that it's falsely reported and non-existent.
[00:26:36.378 --> 00:26:37.758]  It's not helpful, he said.
[00:26:37.818 --> 00:26:39.158]  Well, let me tell people the truth.
[00:26:40.639 --> 00:26:47.261]  The so-called liberal media, the military industrial complex-owned media, only covers the liberal end of things.
[00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:49.582]  Oh, they're violating immigrants' rights.
[00:26:49.862 --> 00:26:49.922]  Oh...
[00:26:50.868 --> 00:26:52.788]  They're wiretapping too many people.
[00:26:52.908 --> 00:26:54.089]  Oh, it's so bad.
[00:26:54.109 --> 00:26:55.829]  And then Ashcroft goes, how dare you?
[00:26:56.109 --> 00:26:56.969]  That's not true.
[00:26:57.289 --> 00:27:01.470]  And conservatives hear that and go, well, we've got to do something about these illegals.
[00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:02.630]  Get them, Ashcroft.
[00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:03.390]  Attaboy.
[00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:12.152]  When the whole thing is geared towards homeschoolers, patriots, gun owners, constitutionalists, states' rights, Christians.
[00:27:14.472 --> 00:27:16.452]  That's what FEMA and the FBI are out doing.
[00:27:16.472 --> 00:27:20.173]  We've got their training manuals, the video of them teaching, and we've got them cold.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.681]  And so the media hasn't called Ashcroft on it effectively.
[00:27:24.861 --> 00:27:26.281]  You have to read the bill yourself.
[00:27:26.961 --> 00:27:28.661]  You have to look at the legislation in the U.S.
[00:27:28.681 --> 00:27:28.921]  Code.
[00:27:29.201 --> 00:27:31.122]  You have to spend days researching it.
[00:27:31.542 --> 00:27:32.242]  Days!
[00:27:32.382 --> 00:27:33.982]  Many nights I stayed up until 4 o'clock.
[00:27:34.022 --> 00:27:37.683]  I'd start at 10 o'clock at night, 12 o'clock at night, go to bed at 4 o'clock.
[00:27:37.743 --> 00:27:40.464]  My wife would come down the stairs and go, Honey, you've got to go to bed.
[00:27:42.944 --> 00:27:46.065]  And I did the research, and everything I told you about it has now come out.
[00:27:47.185 --> 00:27:47.365]  But...
[00:27:48.215 --> 00:27:49.776]  Ashcroft says it doesn't take any rights.
[00:27:49.836 --> 00:27:57.980]  He said the act passed over the attacks of September 11th extended to anti-terrorism efforts the same law enforcement tools that were available to fight other forms of crime.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.840]  That's a flat line.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:09.305]  Provisions that allowed law enforcement agents to monitor a person's reading habits or purchases, for example, were similar to traditional subpoena powers used in murder and drug trafficking investigations.
[00:28:09.345 --> 00:28:10.165]  No, that's not true.
[00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:15.968]  You want all the records from Borders books, you want all the records from the library, and then you tell the
[00:28:17.538 --> 00:28:20.959]  Librarian or the person at the bookstore, they can't tell anybody.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:25.601]  Section 213, break in somebody's house, plant things, take things.
[00:28:26.482 --> 00:28:31.844]  If people catch you, they're not allowed to talk about it or they can be arrested as a terrorist and lose all their rights.
[00:28:33.504 --> 00:28:36.966]  And Ashcroft is saying it doesn't take our liberty and was already there.
[00:28:38.206 --> 00:28:44.769]  Maybe he's right with stuff like asset formature seizure where the old lady's got five grand in her purse and they take it, no drugs are found.
[00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:46.191]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:28:46.211 --> 00:28:48.073]  So yeah, some of this did already exist.
[00:28:48.093 --> 00:28:49.734]  I guess that's true.
[00:29:06.596 --> 00:29:10.638]  We use these tools, Ashcroft said, to secure the liberties of our citizens.
[00:29:11.139 --> 00:29:13.740]  We use these tools to save innocent lives, Ashcroft said.
[00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:18.083]  He was in Alaska to meet with the state's terrorism task force, one of 93 nationwide.
[00:29:18.903 --> 00:29:30.250]  And it goes on, a report by internal investigators, the Justice Department has identified dozens of recent cases in which department employees have been accused of serious civil rights violations involving enforcement of the Patriot Act.
[00:29:32.555 --> 00:29:40.279]  Well, and then they go on to say the Republican-controlled state legislature in Alaska has approved a resolution condemning the act as an infringement on civil liberties.
[00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:42.199]  That's why Ashcroft's panicking.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:49.203]  Hundreds of conservative cities and towns have passed the Bill of Rights Restoration Act.
[00:29:49.483 --> 00:29:50.523]  There's several different acts.
[00:29:51.203 --> 00:29:53.304]  I've written one that's been passed by cities and towns.
[00:29:54.305 --> 00:29:58.967]  So he's panicking and he's lying and we'll expose his lies and take your calls when we get back.
[00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.413]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.915 --> 00:30:03.519]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.442 --> 00:30:07.130]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.621 --> 00:30:14.503]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:30:14.703 --> 00:30:20.165]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:30:20.445 --> 00:30:23.906]  Ideal for tight... 1-866-510-DEBT right now.
[00:30:24.166 --> 00:30:24.626]  That's 1-866-510-3328.
[00:30:26.467 --> 00:30:28.308]  The Credit People.
[00:30:28.468 --> 00:30:30.949]  High interest in people, low interest on loans.
[00:30:36.411 --> 00:30:38.312]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:30:38.813 --> 00:30:41.634]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:44.976]  All right, folks, we're going to open the phones up.
[00:30:45.817 --> 00:30:49.479]  Don't have any guests today because I wanted time to cover the news and take your calls.
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:31:01.427]  Tomorrow, I've got a former city council member, expert on the New World Order, successful businessman, George Humphrey, joining us for two hours to talk about the New World Order and give us his analysis.
[00:31:02.538 --> 00:31:05.260]  But today, we're taking your calls and covering the news.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.742]  The toll-free number to join us on air on this Tuesday edition is 800-259-9231.
[00:31:08.762 --> 00:31:11.204]  That's 800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:31:11.224 --> 00:31:15.807]  Eric in Connecticut and others, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:31:15.827 --> 00:31:17.168]  And again, that's 800-259-9231.
[00:31:17.188 --> 00:31:21.511]  If you're tuning into this show for the first time and you wonder what we're all about,
[00:31:33.232 --> 00:31:34.833]  We're constitutionalists here.
[00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:36.854]  We believe in the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:41.657]  We believe in America, in the Second Amendment, in the family, in Jesus Christ.
[00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:44.478]  We believe in controlling our borders.
[00:31:44.538 --> 00:31:48.701]  We believe in not attacking sovereign countries that have done nothing to us.
[00:31:49.201 --> 00:31:56.685]  We believe in fighting the Big Brother control grid, lowering taxes, abolishing the Federal Reserve, getting out of the United Nations.
[00:31:58.186 --> 00:32:03.150]  That means we're mortal enemies of the neocons and their liberal stooges.
[00:32:03.811 --> 00:32:10.376]  That means we study the bills and the legislation and the news.
[00:32:10.776 --> 00:32:14.439]  And every day people ask me, where do you get all this information?
[00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:16.541]  How do you know so much about the New World Order?
[00:32:18.062 --> 00:32:21.645]  Well, until about... I went to bed kind of early last night.
[00:32:21.665 --> 00:32:26.589]  Until about midnight, I was scanning over news wires and...
[00:32:27.615 --> 00:32:46.442]  Reading government documents, and I got up at about 7 this morning, and by 8 o'clock I was scanning news wires along with my wife, looking at AP, Reuters, Washington Times, BBC, Times of Tokyo, the Straits Times, South African newspapers.
[00:32:46.642 --> 00:32:55.946]  I was scanning over bills, looking at trends with state laws, studying the latest information on vaccine damage to children that's admitted.
[00:32:57.643 --> 00:33:07.949]  I haven't watched more than two hours of TV in the last two weeks.
[00:33:08.449 --> 00:33:11.490]  Now, normally I watch about an hour a day and become physically ill.
[00:33:12.131 --> 00:33:13.792]  Literally, I get nauseated and angry.
[00:33:13.812 --> 00:33:23.517]  Because seeing them lying, seeing how evil they are, watching their smirking criminality, I can't handle it anymore.
[00:33:24.173 --> 00:33:26.534]  So I'm asking you to tape Ashcroft on C-SPAN.
[00:33:26.554 --> 00:33:30.056]  I'm asking you to tape Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:30.116 --> 00:33:31.877]  I'm asking you to keep track of these people.
[00:33:32.037 --> 00:33:33.018]  I can't do it anymore.
[00:33:35.699 --> 00:33:39.721]  I'm so happy not watching TV for the last two weeks.
[00:33:40.081 --> 00:33:42.282]  It's wonderful.
[00:33:45.264 --> 00:33:48.426]  If you see something on C-SPAN or the news, please tape it and send it to us.
[00:33:48.946 --> 00:33:50.206]  Mark it and tell me what it is.
[00:33:50.947 --> 00:33:53.008]  If it's important, I'll watch it and do something with it.
[00:33:53.886 --> 00:33:55.667]  I do a local TV show twice a week.
[00:33:55.727 --> 00:34:03.109]  It's one best of Austin and shown up number three in the ratings here locally, which is wonderful for an Axis TV show.
[00:34:03.189 --> 00:34:05.850]  I have my own obvious commercial radio show.
[00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:12.473]  But I can read the text of what they say and read the text of what they do and not get as angry.
[00:34:13.313 --> 00:34:15.154]  Psychologically, I can't watch it anymore.
[00:34:15.174 --> 00:34:15.774]  I'm sorry.
[00:34:16.294 --> 00:34:18.095]  I think I'm going to continue not watching TV.
[00:34:19.998 --> 00:34:23.481]  If you're going to do it, fine, but it's been wonderful.
[00:34:23.621 --> 00:34:30.326]  So what I do do is read the news wires and the text of speeches.
[00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:35.830]  I can read what Ted Bundy and his ilk do.
[00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:37.311]  It's hard to look at them.
[00:34:38.352 --> 00:34:43.476]  It's hard to look at the serial killers smiling and smirking and posing as our saviors.
[00:34:43.536 --> 00:34:44.397]  I just can't do it anymore.
[00:34:45.726 --> 00:35:02.357]  It'd be like if your next-door neighbor was a serial killer, you knew it, you'd seen them bury 100 bodies in the backyard, you had all the evidence of it, and the police went into the backyard, dug up the dead bodies, and gave the serial killer a reward for exposing it.
[00:35:03.698 --> 00:35:12.824]  And it'd be like watching the police then and go and arrest your other neighbor who helped blow the whistle with you and blame your other neighbor for it.
[00:35:14.043 --> 00:35:20.205]  I just can't watch the serial killers up there anymore smiling and smirking and laughing and lying.
[00:35:21.045 --> 00:35:22.486]  I just, I can't do it.
[00:35:22.606 --> 00:35:23.986]  I can't watch them anymore.
[00:35:24.327 --> 00:35:25.247]  It's too painful.
[00:35:27.828 --> 00:35:33.330]  Because that's exactly what they are, and just thinking about it, I'm getting sick at my stomach.
[00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:33.850]  I am.
[00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:35.270]  I'm getting a headache right now.
[00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.511]  I'm going to get that image out of my mind.
[00:35:38.471 --> 00:35:39.752]  Get the images of them out of my mind.
[00:35:39.772 --> 00:35:40.412]  Okay, there we go.
[00:35:42.722 --> 00:35:43.563]  I tell you, these people.
[00:35:45.204 --> 00:35:46.444]  It really is affecting me, okay?
[00:35:48.886 --> 00:35:49.947]  Maybe we should just air a song.
[00:35:51.328 --> 00:35:52.608]  Right now, I might need to take a break.
[00:35:52.728 --> 00:35:53.649]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[00:35:53.709 --> 00:35:54.430]  I can't handle it.
[00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:55.550]  Hold on just a minute.
[00:35:57.311 --> 00:35:59.153]  They're having an anxiety attack just thinking about them.
[00:36:00.834 --> 00:36:02.174]  Because, see, I'm normal, folks.
[00:36:02.235 --> 00:36:03.775]  It affects me to know what they are.
[00:36:05.617 --> 00:36:06.317]  It affects me.
[00:36:06.337 --> 00:36:08.679]  I was just talking to Chris, who runs the show.
[00:36:09.539 --> 00:36:10.580]  He was saying the same thing.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.201]  He says he doesn't watch TV anymore.
[00:36:13.118 --> 00:36:19.719]  He listens to the news here on the network and scans the news wires while he's running the show and occasionally they give me a tidbit of news before I can get it.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.680]  And he says he can't watch TV.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.200]  He goes home and reads a book every night.
[00:36:26.321 --> 00:36:27.581]  And I'm the same way.
[00:36:29.301 --> 00:36:41.524]  I didn't mean to get off into a diatribe on this, but just thinking about them and having flashbacks to watching them smile and smirk and giggle and have little inside jokes together on the news shows and to see the CFR up there on C-SPAN and
[00:36:42.597 --> 00:36:44.158]  To watch them just makes me sick.
[00:36:45.219 --> 00:36:59.007]  And yes, if I'd have been scanning the TVs like I normally do, normally in my office I keep three TVs on, on different cable channels and on satellite, watching all three channels of C-SPAN and keeping a couple channels off and on.
[00:36:59.027 --> 00:37:01.008]  I'll flip the channels around to the news channels.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:13.063]  Or I'll flip over to cartoons and it's the kids' DNA databasing, thumb scanning, retina scanning, massive conditioning, gun control, promos on Nickelodeon.
[00:37:13.443 --> 00:37:14.623]  I flip over to the movies.
[00:37:14.663 --> 00:37:15.704]  That's full of propaganda.
[00:37:15.744 --> 00:37:18.064]  I flip over to sitcoms and dramas.
[00:37:18.104 --> 00:37:22.445]  It's all about torture and world government and New World Order this, New World Order that.
[00:37:24.406 --> 00:37:26.607]  The propaganda's gotten so bad I had to turn it off.
[00:37:27.707 --> 00:37:31.708]  Because, again, I just walk around the office or walk around home
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.144]  And watch them all over the channels, and I'd turn up the volume and hear what they were saying and pop a tape in.
[00:37:38.184 --> 00:37:44.109]  I kept tapes on all the VCRs, and I've got giant stacks of video we haven't even logged or watched yet.
[00:37:45.671 --> 00:37:51.996]  And I've gotten a bigger office, and I've got more people in there now trying to log these and watch them.
[00:37:55.799 --> 00:37:58.281]  They're so evil, there's no way to track their lies and evil.
[00:37:58.321 --> 00:38:01.404]  I could take one article and dissect it and show you hundreds of lies.
[00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:05.811]  All right, your calls are coming up in a minute.
[00:38:05.892 --> 00:38:07.173]  Eric in Connecticut and others.
[00:38:08.314 --> 00:38:15.199]  But I literally did just get a panging headache and started getting nauseated thinking about it.
[00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:25.128]  Because I have to watch the serial killers sit up there and talk about how they're going to save us by taking all our rights away if we'll just give them more control.
[00:38:25.708 --> 00:38:32.434]  And if that doesn't make you freak out, if that doesn't make your heart beat faster, if it doesn't make you get a headache...
[00:38:33.576 --> 00:38:34.317]  I don't know what will.
[00:38:35.878 --> 00:38:48.026]  Because I'd imagine police officers, good police officers, good detectives, good FBI that are out there who are compartmentalized and actually do a good job, they know what I'm talking about.
[00:38:48.367 --> 00:39:01.236]  They know what it's like to know somebody's a criminal, to know they're a murderer, to know they're a thief, and to watch them get away with it, and to watch them... I guess the police don't know what it's like then, because they don't have to...
[00:39:01.963 --> 00:39:07.365]  Investigate a criminal and then watch him on the news as our savior being given rewards and awards.
[00:39:08.566 --> 00:39:09.646]  So I guess you don't know.
[00:39:09.706 --> 00:39:14.768]  It's worse than what a few of the police and detectives out there have experienced, okay?
[00:39:15.028 --> 00:39:16.049]  It's a lot worse.
[00:39:16.409 --> 00:39:17.749]  It's very painful.
[00:39:17.769 --> 00:39:26.973]  I've got to cover some of this news, and I promise I'll get to the loaded phones here in a minute.
[00:39:28.934 --> 00:39:29.214]  I just...
[00:39:33.487 --> 00:39:35.508]  Really did affect me, bringing back those images.
[00:39:36.489 --> 00:39:38.009]  That's why I turn the TVs off, though.
[00:39:38.149 --> 00:39:43.692]  And I don't know how long I'm going to do it, because I get all the same news out of the newspaper, and more.
[00:39:45.653 --> 00:39:47.374]  I just don't have to look at them.
[00:39:47.894 --> 00:39:48.255]  All right.
[00:39:48.895 --> 00:39:51.756]  Report on USA Patriot Act-alleged civil rights violations.
[00:39:52.097 --> 00:39:58.380]  It's an internal Justice Department report that got leaked and admits they're violating people's rights all over the place.
[00:39:59.361 --> 00:40:17.448]  But Ashcroft up in Anchorage where the Republican State House has voted to decry the Patriot Act because they've read the subsections and how they can secretly break in your house and take whatever they want or plant whatever they want and you can't tell anybody they did or secretly arrest you or secretly execute you and how it's written for all crimes and all misdemeanors.
[00:40:18.668 --> 00:40:28.292]  So Ashcroft's desperate up there grandstanding in Anchorage yesterday lying and I've got the complete text of what he said and I could spend two hours reading it and dissecting the lies.
[00:40:28.312 --> 00:40:28.952]  We don't have time.
[00:40:30.167 --> 00:40:34.871]  But maybe you'll tape it and send it to me because I really need it for a new film.
[00:40:34.911 --> 00:40:37.132]  But I should have watched it, but I just couldn't do it.
[00:40:37.273 --> 00:40:38.133]  I can't do it anymore.
[00:40:38.974 --> 00:40:42.036]  Report on USA Patriot Act alleges civil rights violations.
[00:40:42.096 --> 00:40:47.820]  But then we have Ashcroft, who said there wasn't a second Patriot Act, now admitting a month ago there is before Congress.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:54.626]  Well, now he's back in the same speech saying the Patriot Act doesn't affect citizens or take your rights away.
[00:40:56.787 --> 00:40:59.189]  And then in the same speech saying he wants to expand it.
[00:41:00.034 --> 00:41:06.975]  And then, of course, the article and Ashcroft don't tell you what areas they want to expand.
[00:41:07.115 --> 00:41:09.996]  They give you some side issue of, oh, more wiretaps.
[00:41:10.636 --> 00:41:16.677]  And they already have unlimited wiretaps under Echelon and Total Information Awareness, which, by the way, did not get defunded.
[00:41:16.697 --> 00:41:18.417]  It's been around for decades.
[00:41:18.897 --> 00:41:20.638]  A current plan got defunded.
[00:41:20.658 --> 00:41:24.298]  It was DARPA put the microphones and cameras up in Austin five years ago.
[00:41:24.318 --> 00:41:25.399]  That's what I mean.
[00:41:25.459 --> 00:41:26.819]  Just to understand their system...
[00:41:27.742 --> 00:41:30.303]  And then to see their lies and try to decipher it for you.
[00:41:30.323 --> 00:41:31.223]  There's too many lies.
[00:41:31.303 --> 00:41:34.024]  I'm being hit by millions of them here.
[00:41:36.005 --> 00:41:44.207]  So, Tupper Patriot, Attorney General, says, Controversy law gives government broader powers for surveillance, monitoring phones.
[00:41:45.368 --> 00:41:46.388]  And gets into that.
[00:41:46.528 --> 00:41:48.269]  And then now I want to do a flashback.
[00:41:48.289 --> 00:41:51.030]  That's out of the Anchorage Daily News.
[00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.991]  I want to do a flashback to the Washington Times.
[00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:54.851]  Then I'll go to your calls.
[00:41:55.652 --> 00:42:07.579]  This is a flashback from the Washington Times a month ago, and it was by Frank J. Murray, Patriot Act of 2001, cast wide net.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:16.505]  Now understand, Patriot Act 1 does affect citizens, Section 802, any action that endangers human life that's a violation of any federal or state law.
[00:42:16.865 --> 00:42:22.809]  You can be secretly arrested, secretly executed, no one even knows where you went, right out of the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[00:42:24.292 --> 00:42:26.894]  The new Patriot Act says that's too narrow.
[00:42:26.974 --> 00:42:27.974]  They want unlimited.
[00:42:28.415 --> 00:42:33.838]  Even if you don't commit a misdemeanor or knowingly commit a misdemeanor, they want to be able to secretly arrest you and execute you.
[00:42:33.878 --> 00:42:36.099]  That's just one of the little nightmare tidbits.
[00:42:38.401 --> 00:42:39.701]  And then now here's another one.
[00:42:40.242 --> 00:42:42.143]  This is from the Washington Times.
[00:42:42.223 --> 00:42:43.544]  Maybe you want to go read this.
[00:42:43.584 --> 00:42:47.066]  We posted it again today amongst Ashcroft's newest spin.
[00:42:48.590 --> 00:43:02.363]  Long-sought details have begun to emerge from the Justice Department on how anti-terror provisions of the USA Patriot Act were applied in non-terror investigations, just as battle lines are being drawn on proposed new powers in Patriot Act II.
[00:43:02.903 --> 00:43:14.513]  Overall, the policy now allows evidence to be used for prosecuting common criminals, even when obtained under extraordinary anti-terrorism powers and information sharing between intelligence agencies and the FBI.
[00:43:16.946 --> 00:43:17.527]  Did you hear that?
[00:43:17.847 --> 00:43:34.363]  Overall, the policy now allows evidence to be used for prosecuting common criminals, even when obtaining under extraordinary anti-terror powers, information shared between intelligence agencies and the FBI, and they've said the CIA is already acting domestically and taking over police departments, according to the Times-Picayune and the AP.
[00:43:35.104 --> 00:43:36.525]  Quote, this is the Washington Times.
[00:43:37.166 --> 00:43:39.128]  This is the Justice Department before Congress.
[00:43:39.148 --> 00:43:40.409]  They said this out of their mouths.
[00:43:41.542 --> 00:43:47.184]  We would use whatever tools are available to us within reason to prosecute violators of any law.
[00:43:47.284 --> 00:43:55.028]  Justice Department spokesman Brian Sierra said in the wake of his department's massive report to Congress describing how the USA Patriot Act is being implemented.
[00:43:56.968 --> 00:44:01.050]  We would use whatever tools are available to us within reason to prosecute violators of any law.
[00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:07.653]  Justice Department spokesman Brian Sierra said in the wake of his department's massive report to Congress describing how the USA Patriot Act is being implemented.
[00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:23.021]  The information was a response to doubts, not from outspoken civil liberties groups, but from Representative F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr., a Wisconsin Republican, and the House Judiciary Committee chairman who publicly pushed for its speedy 337-79 House passage.
[00:44:24.242 --> 00:44:36.512]  So this is their official report raising this, saying it'll be used at chuck points, in drug investigations, in robbery investigations, in family violence investigations.
[00:44:37.802 --> 00:44:37.962]  I think?
[00:44:59.756 --> 00:45:09.021]  When it's on the record that it does, but they know most of you will never read the bills, and you'll never read the reports by their own Justice Department.
[00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:11.322]  Let's talk to Eric in Connecticut.
[00:45:11.402 --> 00:45:12.182]  Eric, you're on the air.
[00:45:12.222 --> 00:45:12.643]  Go ahead.
[00:45:13.883 --> 00:45:14.404]  Hello, Alex.
[00:45:14.764 --> 00:45:15.084]  Welcome.
[00:45:15.544 --> 00:45:16.144]  God bless you.
[00:45:16.585 --> 00:45:19.326]  I'm a relatively new listener and a first-time caller.
[00:45:22.964 --> 00:45:28.529]  I receive the First Freedom, the National Rifle Association's publication.
[00:45:28.729 --> 00:45:30.771]  I'm also a life member of Gun Owners of America.
[00:45:30.891 --> 00:45:32.712]  I'm a firearms instructor, among other things.
[00:45:33.693 --> 00:45:38.077]  And I will let you know that here in Skull and Bones country, you do have fellow patriots up here.
[00:45:38.357 --> 00:45:39.158]  I know that, yes.
[00:45:40.859 --> 00:45:43.422]  They had a speech by Kane Robinson.
[00:45:43.462 --> 00:45:47.745]  I suppose that the last annual meeting, this was the keynote address that he gave.
[00:45:49.006 --> 00:45:50.708]  And it is in the First Freedom.
[00:45:51.670 --> 00:46:00.000]  And he's quoted as saying that Bush protects our freedoms, that we don't need to work out of the White House because Bush protects our freedoms.
[00:46:00.961 --> 00:46:06.267]  He basically bashes anybody in his speech who is against the Iraq War, and there's really no...
[00:46:08.757 --> 00:46:10.078]  Yes, I have that report, Alex.
[00:46:10.258 --> 00:46:12.700]  And what I'm planning on doing is writing an op-ed to my local paper I do write.
[00:46:36.443 --> 00:46:39.285]  And, in fact, I'm going to be giving copies of your video.
[00:46:39.305 --> 00:46:41.888]  Email that to Prison Planet, sir, and millions will read it.
[00:46:42.128 --> 00:46:43.109]  We're looking for more.
[00:46:44.286 --> 00:46:48.569]  We want some Second Amendment writers for Prison Planet, and millions, sir.
[00:46:48.909 --> 00:46:49.509]  Okay, I did email him.
[00:46:49.529 --> 00:46:49.949]  We'll read it.
[00:46:50.189 --> 00:46:54.172]  Please talk to Paul Joseph Watson over at Prison Planet.
[00:46:54.292 --> 00:46:56.233]  Email him, and please send us your op-ed.
[00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:58.174]  Okay, I did email him.
[00:46:58.434 --> 00:47:00.876]  He must get a lot of stuff, Alex, because I didn't get anything back.
[00:47:00.956 --> 00:47:02.096]  Well, I'm getting $2,000 today.
[00:47:02.136 --> 00:47:03.357]  I don't know what Paul's getting.
[00:47:03.377 --> 00:47:05.238]  That's why we've got him on the team to help us.
[00:47:05.478 --> 00:47:05.678]  Right.
[00:47:05.878 --> 00:47:07.980]  But email him at what?
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:12.742]  Paul at propaganda matrix dot com, and we'll review your article.
[00:47:12.762 --> 00:47:13.623]  Good chance we'll post it.
[00:47:13.883 --> 00:47:15.085]  Okay, Alex, and one last thing.
[00:47:15.125 --> 00:47:16.707]  I know you've got a lot of callers, so I'll be quick.
[00:47:17.428 --> 00:47:22.174]  I'm trying to get my first selectman in Iannik here to go against the Patriot Act.
[00:47:22.214 --> 00:47:29.743]  There was a big effort about three towns over in Stonington, and somehow the local officials put the k-box on it.
[00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:31.686]  There was quite a write-up in my local paper about it.
[00:47:32.523 --> 00:47:38.224]  And I'm making copies of your 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny, and I'm giving them to friends, and, in fact, I'm going to be giving them to local officials.
[00:47:38.584 --> 00:47:40.144]  So I just want to say I pray for you, Alex.
[00:47:40.224 --> 00:47:42.805]  God bless you, and I appreciate what you're doing.
[00:47:42.845 --> 00:47:46.126]  Well, Eric, let me keep you on a few more seconds, and we'll come back and take more calls, folks.
[00:47:47.206 --> 00:47:52.007]  So you're saying the NRA magazine says that Bush isn't going to take our liberties.
[00:47:52.987 --> 00:47:53.667]  Basically, yes.
[00:47:53.727 --> 00:47:54.667]  They sing his praises.
[00:47:55.227 --> 00:47:58.648]  Kane Robinson, he's the new president, of course, I guess, Charlton Heston,
[00:47:59.546 --> 00:48:02.348]  Now, let me just add something.
[00:48:04.409 --> 00:48:11.693]  Their own Legislative Alert Center admits that Bush is going to re-sign the assault weapons ban and add a ban on semi-automatic shotguns of any type.
[00:48:11.993 --> 00:48:13.253]  Is that defending our liberties?
[00:48:14.934 --> 00:48:15.795]  I don't think so, Alex.
[00:48:16.615 --> 00:48:19.997]  Yeah, well, see, you've got good people and bad people in the NRA.
[00:48:21.157 --> 00:48:24.919]  And this guy needs to be removed if he indeed said that, and I'm sure he did.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.041]  Email me that and I'll post it.
[00:48:27.281 --> 00:48:27.741]  Thank you, sir.
[00:48:28.516 --> 00:48:29.437]  We'll be back with more calls.
[00:48:32.661 --> 00:48:38.869]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:41.352]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:48:41.552 --> 00:48:47.920]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:48.881]  We're good to go.
[00:49:08.442 --> 00:49:09.102]  We're good to go.
[00:49:30.518 --> 00:49:34.000]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.761]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:49:37.861 --> 00:49:41.803]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:49:42.023 --> 00:49:48.186]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:48.586 --> 00:49:56.510]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:02.252]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:50:02.412 --> 00:50:06.193]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:50:06.554 --> 00:50:08.394]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:50:08.474 --> 00:50:10.655]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:50:10.875 --> 00:50:16.137]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:50:16.177 --> 00:50:21.399]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.644]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:50:29.325 --> 00:50:33.669]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:38.253]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:38.413 --> 00:50:42.817]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:42.837 --> 00:50:44.179]  The New World Order.
[00:50:45.961 --> 00:50:50.162]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:50.242 --> 00:50:57.164]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:59.384]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:50:59.565 --> 00:51:09.787]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:10.308 --> 00:51:15.713]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:28.995]  But, you know, earlier in the hour, I shared with you that it really is nauseating to watch the globalists day in, day out, hundreds of hours of it of mine, lying and manipulating when I know that they're criminals, I know they've carried out murders of the American people, I know they're destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution, I love this country, I love my family, and I can't believe this is happening to America.
[00:52:30.416 --> 00:52:32.077]  Coming up, there is just so much news.
[00:52:32.097 --> 00:52:37.441]  We'll talk about North Korea, the latest developments in Iraq, a bunch of September 11th prayer knowledge now coming out.
[00:52:38.362 --> 00:52:42.104]  It's all coming up in the next hour, but we are about to go straight to your calls.
[00:52:42.285 --> 00:52:51.051]  Before I go to Dan and Charles and Daniel and Dwayne and others, I do want everybody out there to take action and to get my videos.
[00:52:52.494 --> 00:52:57.135]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, covers September 11th of government-sponsored terror and the globalist master plan.
[00:52:57.555 --> 00:53:03.277]  Part two of that film, that two-and-a-half-hour film, is The Masters of Terror.
[00:53:03.397 --> 00:53:05.697]  It's over two hours, two hours, five minutes long.
[00:53:05.897 --> 00:53:06.358]  Excellent.
[00:53:07.018 --> 00:53:09.738]  Police State Threat Hotel Enslavement is my newest film.
[00:53:09.798 --> 00:53:20.241]  It's very informative, covers dozens of examples of government-sponsored terror other than 9-1-1, Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security and gun control and a bunch of other key stuff.
[00:53:21.095 --> 00:53:23.460]  The videos are $25.95 apiece.

[00:54:21.775 --> 00:54:24.456]  They're all excellent, and your purchase supports this show.
[00:54:24.897 --> 00:54:27.318]  Again, 888-253-3139.
[00:54:28.139 --> 00:54:33.802]  At the grassroots, start exposing the neocons and the globalists for what they are.
[00:54:34.682 --> 00:54:36.543]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Illinois.
[00:54:36.583 --> 00:54:37.344]  Dan, you're on the air.
[00:54:37.364 --> 00:54:37.744]  Go ahead.
[00:54:39.995 --> 00:54:42.857]  We'll go to Charles and Dave and Dwayne and others.
[00:54:42.897 --> 00:54:43.518]  Go ahead, Dan.
[00:54:45.879 --> 00:54:47.120]  Alex, this is Dan in Idaho.
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:47.781]  Oh, it's Idaho.
[00:54:47.801 --> 00:54:48.161]  Go ahead.
[00:54:48.681 --> 00:54:49.862]  Thank you very much for the time.
[00:54:50.883 --> 00:54:53.705]  You were mentioning a torture of the American people.
[00:54:54.245 --> 00:54:59.469]  I'd like to give you a couple of cases in point to help the listening audience get some reality.
[00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:08.435]  Back in 96-97, I was involved in assisting on a torture situation in Billingsley, Montana.
[00:55:09.521 --> 00:55:12.624]  Dan Peterson, Leroy Switzer, and those guys at Freeman over there.
[00:55:13.504 --> 00:55:14.625]  We were called in.
[00:55:15.306 --> 00:55:18.028]  Several guys out of Washington State and Idaho went over there.
[00:55:19.029 --> 00:55:27.716]  They were hanging these guys by their arms behind their back and taking a jail key and twisting up their noses until their bowels released.
[00:55:28.937 --> 00:55:30.478]  We went over there and got that stopped.
[00:55:31.879 --> 00:55:33.200]  It's terrible what's been going on.
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:35.502]  It's probably that story about those people
[00:55:35.973 --> 00:55:39.876]  It was probably the most misreported story, probably worse than McVeigh.
[00:55:40.697 --> 00:55:48.764]  Well, for those that don't know, I had the London Guardian, an official British court, open court, they said torture is acceptable.
[00:55:50.605 --> 00:55:50.965]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:51.706 --> 00:55:55.009]  And it's been going on for a number of years and not reported by anyone.
[00:55:55.089 --> 00:55:57.751]  Well, they tortured the children at Waco with the gas and the fire.
[00:55:58.071 --> 00:55:58.952]  They certainly did.
[00:55:58.972 --> 00:56:03.896]  And I'm as frustrated and nauseated as you are, Alex, and I have been for years.
[00:56:04.767 --> 00:56:05.648]  It makes me sick.
[00:56:06.128 --> 00:56:12.471]  If you've got a soul and a conscience left, every fiber of your body and soul cries out against this.
[00:56:12.511 --> 00:56:13.612]  Anything else, Dan?
[00:56:13.932 --> 00:56:14.973]  Yeah, I've got one other situation.
[00:56:14.993 --> 00:56:15.393]  Stay there.
[00:56:15.553 --> 00:56:16.653]  We've got to start the second hour.
[00:56:16.713 --> 00:56:18.414]  I'll go to you next and then on to others.
[00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:19.575]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:21.616 --> 00:56:22.216]  Hello, folks.
[00:56:22.236 --> 00:56:23.277]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:56:23.597 --> 00:56:29.340]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.502]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the water...
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.561]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.105 --> 00:56:47.745]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:49.486]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.186 --> 00:56:51.347]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.947 --> 00:56:52.787]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.508 --> 00:56:54.448]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.068 --> 00:56:58.770]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:03.332]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.876 --> 00:57:08.157]  John Ashcroft is a big fat puppet.
[00:57:08.757 --> 00:57:15.621]  He's not running anything, neither is George Bush or Bill Clinton or Al Gore or John Kerry or Hillary Clinton or Chuckie Schumer.
[00:57:15.701 --> 00:57:18.342]  They're figureheads, technicians to bring down the republic.
[00:57:18.362 --> 00:57:19.363]  The parties are together.
[00:57:19.943 --> 00:57:20.963]  There isn't a left or right.
[00:57:20.983 --> 00:57:25.126]  There's only New World Order flavors and different systems to implement it.
[00:57:25.206 --> 00:57:29.948]  It's an illusion to give you the perception of a political paradigm.
[00:57:31.664 --> 00:57:41.100]  Now, in the last hour, just recapping, mainstream British news and official British court, they admit that torture is now acceptable and that people who have been tortured, that evidence is admissible in court.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.081]  That's official, folks.
[00:57:42.141 --> 00:57:42.863]  It's been official.
[00:57:43.424 --> 00:57:44.345]  Ashcroft went to...
[00:57:45.971 --> 00:57:51.994]  Up to Alaska to Anchorage where the Republican-controlled government has voted down their Patriot Act.
[00:57:52.114 --> 00:57:53.154]  Ashcroft is panicking.
[00:57:53.174 --> 00:57:55.335]  They want to keep it a left-right issue, which it's not.
[00:57:55.375 --> 00:57:57.456]  It's a liberty versus tyranny issue.
[00:57:57.896 --> 00:58:00.177]  He said the Patriot Act doesn't affect citizens' rights.
[00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:08.620]  So we posted the official Justice Department report and a Washington Times article about it where they admit it's used against all citizens in all crimes.
[00:58:09.741 --> 00:58:12.382]  That Ashcroft is a lying creature.
[00:58:14.148 --> 00:58:15.409]  So that's some of what we've covered.
[00:58:15.429 --> 00:58:21.511]  We've got a bunch of other news on Iraq, a bunch of news on drugging children, inoculations, just a bunch of news.
[00:58:21.571 --> 00:58:22.311]  It's all coming up.
[00:58:23.472 --> 00:58:26.933]  Let's go back to Dan in Idaho, then Charles in Pennsylvania.
[00:58:28.295 --> 00:58:31.739]  Daniel in Georgia, Dwayne in Texas, Allie in Oklahoma, and others.
[00:58:31.979 --> 00:58:32.700]  Go ahead.
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:47.715]  Dan in Idaho was talking about how the Freemen, I read about this, were hung up by their arms and had jail keys crammed up their noses into their sinus where it was twisted to create deep somatic pain but wouldn't leave any marks other than the nosebleeds.
[00:58:48.536 --> 00:58:50.478]  Please continue with the love of the federal government.
[00:58:51.536 --> 00:58:52.096]  Yes, Alex.
[00:58:52.597 --> 00:59:00.620]  One more recent than that is last year, James Michael Neumeier up in Latah County Jail in Idaho had his ribs broke by the U.S.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:05.362]  Marshals up there trying to get him to submit to their Admiralty Court in that venue.
[00:59:05.702 --> 00:59:07.043]  They drug him around by his hair.
[00:59:07.903 --> 00:59:09.584]  They ran a coup baton up his nose.
[00:59:09.764 --> 00:59:13.046]  I personally spoke with the man, and I write to a lot of these guys.
[00:59:13.866 --> 00:59:18.028]  And, you know, I personally spoke to Lieutenant Scott Miller down here
[00:59:18.912 --> 00:59:20.133]  And I'm going to say this right now.
[00:59:20.153 --> 00:59:23.116]  People that do that, if they don't repent of it, are going to hell.
[00:59:23.536 --> 00:59:23.836]  Yes, sir.
[00:59:23.896 --> 00:59:24.297]  Yes, sir.
[00:59:24.437 --> 00:59:31.783]  And these are Christian men that I'm mentioning, and there's thousands of us that are getting that kind of treatment and have for a number of years, Alex.
[00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:50.412]  We're simply declaring your Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:59:50.913 --> 00:59:56.176]  Well, I mean, I've got friends who declare their rights in court, and they'll walk up and knock your teeth out right in front of the judge.
[00:59:56.476 --> 00:59:56.856]  Yes, sir.
[00:59:56.896 --> 00:59:59.778]  We've had guys drug across the bar because they wouldn't submit.
[01:00:00.398 --> 01:00:05.721]  And a lot of these guys, all they want is a grand jury like Dan Peterson and Leroy that they gave to Unabomber.
[01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:11.404]  And now they're gone, and we don't know where they're at or whether they're even alive.
[01:00:12.202 --> 01:00:16.724]  So I appreciate the opportunity to speak out for other Christian patriots.
[01:00:16.744 --> 01:00:17.605]  These are Christian men.
[01:00:17.665 --> 01:00:18.465]  I know them personally.
[01:00:19.326 --> 01:00:20.706]  And I'll let you go on with the show.
[01:00:20.786 --> 01:00:21.987]  It's an excellent show, Alex.
[01:00:22.227 --> 01:00:22.807]  Thank you again.
[01:00:23.728 --> 01:00:24.248]  Thank you.
[01:00:24.668 --> 01:00:25.208]  And you know what?
[01:00:25.228 --> 01:00:28.430]  A lot of people hear this and get scared, but that's all the more reason to fight.
[01:00:31.051 --> 01:00:35.954]  I mean, our forefathers would charge machine gun nests, and our liberty wasn't in as great a danger.
[01:00:37.194 --> 01:00:38.495]  And here in the homeland...
[01:00:39.241 --> 01:00:40.361]  It's all being destroyed.
[01:00:40.682 --> 01:00:46.844]  When they're on the news saying torture is good, that's so the cops and military and police think all this is acceptable.
[01:00:47.924 --> 01:00:49.225]  It's like the neocons said.
[01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:51.626]  They must train the society to enter into evil.
[01:00:52.666 --> 01:00:54.287]  And a mass warping is taking place.
[01:00:54.707 --> 01:00:56.808]  We have to stand up and say no and speak out.
[01:00:58.048 --> 01:01:04.131]  And a lot of good people in government who heard us talk about this years ago have now seen it firsthand and are joining the ranks.
[01:01:05.678 --> 01:01:06.859]  Of the restorationists.
[01:01:06.959 --> 01:01:08.440]  We're fighting the revolutionaries.
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.702]  We are the counter-revolutionaries.
[01:01:10.802 --> 01:01:17.446]  We are defending the real country, the republic, not the corporate fiction that is the private federal reserve and its systems.
[01:01:19.047 --> 01:01:20.748]  And federal marshals call into this show.
[01:01:20.808 --> 01:01:21.909]  They send me information.
[01:01:21.929 --> 01:01:23.470]  FBI.
[01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:28.354]  There are a lot of good people, and they're very upset about what's happening.
[01:01:28.374 --> 01:01:29.454]  They've seen it firsthand.
[01:01:29.975 --> 01:01:31.556]  They know how evil things have gotten.
[01:01:31.576 --> 01:01:33.057]  It's like the homeschooler in New York.
[01:01:33.869 --> 01:01:37.613]  Who has the 3.84 grade average graduating from college.
[01:01:38.173 --> 01:01:39.775]  CPS may take her from the family.
[01:01:39.815 --> 01:01:40.576]  They say that's abuse.
[01:01:42.634 --> 01:01:44.415]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:01:44.596 --> 01:01:50.240]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.421]  Probably never, right?
[01:01:51.701 --> 01:01:54.763]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.
[01:01:55.043 --> 01:01:57.465]  He's the owner and founder of the Cal Bend Soap Company.
[01:01:57.585 --> 01:02:04.891]  For the past 55 years, the Cal Bend Soap Company has been making triple-concentrated pure soaps, exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:02:05.111 --> 01:02:08.875]  Now for the first time, Cal Bend Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:02:09.176 --> 01:02:12.179]  Cal Bend Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[01:02:12.459 --> 01:02:13.861]  It's earth friendly and it's safe.
[01:02:14.161 --> 01:02:16.484]  Call the Cal Bend Soap Company today toll free at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:02:16.504 --> 01:02:16.724]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[01:02:16.744 --> 01:02:18.286]  Save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.
[01:02:26.855 --> 01:02:27.476]  There is a chance.
[01:02:52.693 --> 01:02:55.282]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:02:55.322 --> 01:02:56.687]  The New World Order.
[01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:02.712]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:03:02.752 --> 01:03:09.696]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:03:09.816 --> 01:03:11.917]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:03:12.217 --> 01:03:22.663]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:03:22.823 --> 01:03:25.364]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my
[01:03:25.504 --> 01:03:25.684]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:25.704 --> 01:03:26.745]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:03:26.785 --> 01:03:31.710]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:55.490]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[01:03:55.710 --> 01:04:02.978]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:04:03.238 --> 01:04:07.443]  Potassium iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:08.164]  We're good to go.
[01:04:31.406 --> 01:04:32.107]  Call toll free.
[01:04:32.127 --> 01:04:32.167]  888-803-4438.
[01:04:32.187 --> 01:04:33.267]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:33.528]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:04:47.322 --> 01:04:47.962]  Big Brother.
[01:04:48.622 --> 01:04:49.663]  Mainstream media.
[01:04:50.383 --> 01:04:51.503]  Government cover-ups.
[01:04:52.143 --> 01:04:52.963]  You want answers?
[01:04:53.724 --> 01:04:54.624]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:55.284 --> 01:04:58.945]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:59.465 --> 01:05:03.586]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.806 --> 01:05:10.488]  This broadcast is an alert, a warning to all.
[01:05:11.445 --> 01:05:18.469]  ...in humanity that have souls and love God and love their families and despise and hate wickedness and corruption.
[01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:23.811]  Evil, despotism is growing.
[01:05:25.132 --> 01:05:38.099]  The exact patterns of Russia and Germany are unfolding with an overlay of high technology and sophisticated mass brainwashing, twisting the hearts and minds of the people, torture, preemptive war...
[01:05:39.278 --> 01:05:42.639]  It's being legitimized while our border stays wide open.
[01:05:43.099 --> 01:05:45.539]  Hardened checkpoints are being built into the roads.
[01:05:46.039 --> 01:05:49.120]  Millions of face-scanning cameras are being erected.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.300]  Armored vehicles are being delivered to police departments.
[01:05:52.761 --> 01:06:00.942]  Giant FEMA camps have been built, according to the Rocky Mountain News, Associated Press, Newsmax, and a hundred other mainstream publications.
[01:06:01.542 --> 01:06:03.023]  Foreign troops are massing.
[01:06:03.563 --> 01:06:05.403]  The Bill of Rights is being erased.
[01:06:06.147 --> 01:06:13.474]  Execution centers are being built from Terre Haute, Indiana to Camp Delta in Guantanamo.
[01:06:15.596 --> 01:06:24.225]  But if we speak out and we point out this evil and we decry it from every hilltop and churchtop and every valley and every hamlet and every meadow...
[01:06:26.098 --> 01:06:28.620]  If we do that now, we can bite the globalists off.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:37.665]  If we're silent, and if we go along with this, they will legitimize this latest wave of acceleration of evil, and they will move on to the next phase.
[01:06:38.245 --> 01:06:40.867]  We are in a death grip struggle.
[01:06:42.748 --> 01:06:51.913]  Many people are cowards deep down inside, and will make the subconscious split-second decision to join the New World Order, to join the dark side.
[01:06:53.775 --> 01:07:16.580]  But many who have heard us warn them in detail for years as we exposed the architecture and plans of the New World Order, many in the system that heard us and rolled their eyes have now seen it all transpire exactly as we warned them and they are now waking up and joining the side of goodness and decency and honor and strength and will.
[01:07:18.112 --> 01:07:19.893]  God bless you for joining us.
[01:07:20.394 --> 01:07:21.394]  I pray you'll be blessed.
[01:07:21.934 --> 01:07:26.557]  And I pray you'll be filled with the Spirit of the Lord to fight the New World Order.
[01:07:27.578 --> 01:07:30.460]  And I ask God to protect all those that fight the New World Order.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:42.988]  And I ask God to awaken members of the New World Order, like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus, and that they become great leaders in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:07:45.259 --> 01:07:46.499]  We've got to do it, my friends.
[01:07:46.779 --> 01:07:48.400]  We've got to resist the New World Order.
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:52.621]  We've got to ask God to guide us, lead us, to guide us, to direct us.
[01:07:54.021 --> 01:07:57.261]  This is it for all the marbles, the battle for the republic.
[01:07:57.682 --> 01:07:58.542]  Back to your calls.
[01:07:59.062 --> 01:08:02.242]  Charles in Pennsylvania, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:08:03.483 --> 01:08:04.103]  Mr. Jones.
[01:08:04.343 --> 01:08:04.623]  Yes.
[01:08:05.423 --> 01:08:14.285]  Yeah, I called you about this guy, Minglin Kelly, but first I want to say, I think, in my humble opinion, that you...
[01:08:15.009 --> 01:08:19.051]  You can take a lot of credit for turning a lot of this back.
[01:08:19.171 --> 01:08:24.734]  I think you can take a lot of credit for what's went on in these cities and what went on in Alaska.
[01:08:26.255 --> 01:08:32.218]  And you have become the spokesman of shortwave radio and have exposed that.
[01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:37.781]  And all the people on there, and a lot of these people are extremely bright, as you well know.
[01:08:39.185 --> 01:08:40.986]  And it has helped us enormously.
[01:08:41.046 --> 01:08:46.229]  You've just come up with the right vehicle to extrapolate this across the country.
[01:08:46.649 --> 01:08:52.372]  Well, I'm one of many people, but I do try to stay on target and key infrastructure points of the New World Order.
[01:08:52.893 --> 01:09:00.177]  Instead of attacking the Death Star with a frontal assault, we try to go into key areas of their lives and short-circuit their program.
[01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:00.517]  But...
[01:09:01.394 --> 01:09:05.516]  I would also add to that that this show is not just on shortwave.
[01:09:05.976 --> 01:09:08.678]  This network has over 300 AM and FM affiliates.
[01:09:08.758 --> 01:09:09.738]  Many of them I'm on.
[01:09:10.459 --> 01:09:17.182]  One of the largest Internet audiences, routinely number one on shoutcast out of over 3,000 radio stations and networks.
[01:09:18.063 --> 01:09:19.283]  And that's just one of our streams.
[01:09:19.303 --> 01:09:22.025]  We have three streams, and they're almost always in the top ten.
[01:09:22.685 --> 01:09:25.346]  You combine our streams, we're almost always number one.
[01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:28.148]  And we are doing it together with God's help.
[01:09:29.053 --> 01:09:31.515]  Well, even better that you're on these other programs.
[01:09:32.196 --> 01:09:35.779]  Well, yes, I have done over 1,000 radio interviews since 9-1-1.
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.201]  That has had a great effect.
[01:09:38.502 --> 01:09:46.849]  And you've had people on who the general public would never have heard of, you know, like Dennis Cuddy.
[01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:48.591]  I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:52.274]  But these people that really have something significant to say.
[01:09:52.294 --> 01:09:53.856]  There's one reason I'm still alive.
[01:09:54.864 --> 01:09:55.986]  I think we're good to go.
[01:10:12.727 --> 01:10:15.950]  ...support fascism, want to set up a police state.
[01:10:16.651 --> 01:10:19.153]  You see, it's not just Alex Jones or Ron Paul.
[01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:29.543]  There are thousands of outspoken people, thousands of talk show hosts that you'll never hear about because they're on locally in different areas, who are just as articulate and who are fighting.
[01:10:29.783 --> 01:10:33.806]  There are thousands of websites, hundreds of books, hundreds of videos about 9-1-1.
[01:10:34.267 --> 01:10:36.709]  We're winning the fight, so there's too many of us now, sir.
[01:10:36.989 --> 01:10:38.070]  And they know we're fearless.
[01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:38.651]  They know...
[01:10:39.665 --> 01:10:40.186]  We're good to go.
[01:10:49.306 --> 01:11:02.550]  Well, the information that at one time in the not-too-distant past was just brushed aside and laughed off is not anymore because you have articulate people putting this forward.
[01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:04.591]  Sir, I just started... It's a good point.
[01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:05.031]  It's true.
[01:11:05.151 --> 01:11:06.331]  I just started working out again.
[01:11:06.351 --> 01:11:07.552]  I've lost 12 pounds.
[01:11:07.572 --> 01:11:10.393]  I started swimming, jogging, and lifting weights.
[01:11:11.753 --> 01:11:16.194]  And it has the bad side effect of my testosterone level being higher, so I'm more aggressive.
[01:11:17.515 --> 01:11:17.675]  But...
[01:11:19.037 --> 01:11:40.270]  So I'm in the gym, I'm at the pool, I'm jogging, and I have police, DEA agents, lawyers, doctors, city council members walk over to me in a restaurant or at the mall or in the grocery store or at Gold's Gym and tell me I'm right and they're scared.
[01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:40.891]  What do they do?
[01:11:40.951 --> 01:11:44.533]  I had a city councilwoman tell me that she's scared, it's all true, that
[01:11:45.716 --> 01:11:47.578]  That the feds are trying to take the city over.
[01:11:47.938 --> 01:11:49.620]  I mean, look, it's horrible.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.200]  It's evil.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.022]  I'm glad people... They should be waking up.
[01:11:53.844 --> 01:12:00.629]  Well, another... Get off on another... A patriot that I know, maybe you've heard of him, maybe not.
[01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:01.790]  His name is Mike Grady.
[01:12:02.671 --> 01:12:04.753]  They had him in prison in Florida for quite a while.
[01:12:04.813 --> 01:12:09.137]  And he's... He believes in what he's doing, and I'm not quite sure what that is.
[01:12:09.197 --> 01:12:10.318]  But he was released...
[01:12:11.061 --> 01:12:12.942]  Imagine, how do you... Folks, I'm guilty when I'm rude to a store clerk.
[01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:13.942]  I'm guilty when I'm mean to my wife.
[01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:14.703]  Say something rude.
[01:12:14.723 --> 01:12:15.423]  How do you beat up people...
[01:12:38.536 --> 01:12:39.957]  We're good to go.
[01:13:04.494 --> 01:13:05.274]  We're good to go.
[01:13:27.702 --> 01:13:39.286]  But I remember a few times where I was a little bit in the wrong and where I got in a fight with somebody who weighed less than I did or was the same size and I couldn't even fight them.
[01:13:40.086 --> 01:13:42.227]  When I tried to swing, I had no power.
[01:13:42.947 --> 01:13:53.170]  But when somebody big tries to corner me or one time three guys attacked me, broke my leg, I hospitalized them, savagely crushed their skulls,
[01:13:53.869 --> 01:13:58.310]  Whenever I'm cornered, when the bully attacks me, and see, that's why I get nauseated.
[01:13:58.550 --> 01:14:04.012]  I have to watch the bullies winning and winning and winning and winning and winning and abusing and abusing and abusing.
[01:14:04.312 --> 01:14:11.514]  And I don't know how, I don't know how people can bully someone who's down.
[01:14:11.875 --> 01:14:13.575]  That goes against my programming.
[01:14:13.655 --> 01:14:15.136]  Doesn't that go against your programming?
[01:14:16.136 --> 01:14:19.757]  Absolutely, and this brings me around to why I called you.
[01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:21.817]  They're really on the ropes.
[01:14:21.897 --> 01:14:31.522]  When you were talking about television, I never watch television, but I happened to be in Radio Shack yesterday, and they had the barns, and I can't remember, it was like a square table, and they were doing this.
[01:14:32.263 --> 01:14:36.985]  They are panicking over this Kelly guy that they've obviously killed.
[01:14:37.786 --> 01:14:46.611]  And they were spinning this as, I mean, the people from Fox News and all these other places were looking at them like, oh, I mean, come on.
[01:14:47.011 --> 01:14:49.172]  They had barns, and I can't think that,
[01:14:49.773 --> 01:14:52.235]  What are you talking about again?
[01:14:52.295 --> 01:14:54.536]  They were talking about this Kelly that was killed.
[01:15:15.754 --> 01:15:17.655]  Microbiologist from England.
[01:15:17.935 --> 01:15:18.195]  Yeah.
[01:15:18.435 --> 01:15:22.117]  Who was... Yeah, but I mean specifically, what area of that?
[01:15:22.137 --> 01:15:22.977]  Well, look, it's obvious.
[01:15:22.997 --> 01:15:27.699]  The guy had just told his family and friends and telephone calls and emails, I'm going to fight this.
[01:15:27.839 --> 01:15:28.639]  I've been mistreated.
[01:15:29.079 --> 01:15:30.040]  I'm going to go public.
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:31.880]  And then he ends up dead a couple hours later.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:32.401]  Give me a break.
[01:15:32.481 --> 01:15:33.741]  Well, this is Fred Barnes.
[01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:34.542]  I think that's one of them.
[01:15:34.562 --> 01:15:35.542]  Do you know who I'm talking about?
[01:15:35.996 --> 01:15:36.256]  Yes.
[01:15:36.657 --> 01:15:37.657]  Okay.
[01:15:37.677 --> 01:15:52.668]  And the rest of that people that are in that crowd, they were spinning this thing about this Kelly, that he really had nothing to do with this, and it was all the BBC, and they were saying things, and they really should apologize that it's not true.
[01:15:53.388 --> 01:15:57.031]  And it just seemed to be, just from the looks on their faces.
[01:15:57.131 --> 01:15:58.272]  Well, that's how the spin works.
[01:15:58.292 --> 01:16:01.174]  Let me break it down briefly in the seconds we've got left, and we'll come back and take calls.
[01:16:02.438 --> 01:16:13.941]  He went before Parliament, he said, yes, I gave some of the information to the BBC, not all of it, and then they mistreated him, and then he said, okay, I'll go ahead and go public, and then he got killed.
[01:16:14.241 --> 01:16:27.265]  So see, now they can try to spin it and say, oh, look, BBC, you put him out there and made him commit suicide, when in his emails and phone calls, which are public now, he told people he'd been mistreated by the government, not by the BBC.
[01:16:28.172 --> 01:16:34.341]  But see, now that he's dead, he can't speak out for himself, but luckily there's the email and what he told his wife and children and others.
[01:16:35.262 --> 01:16:36.263]  But really good points.
[01:16:36.283 --> 01:16:37.565]  And I've got more news on Kelly.
[01:16:37.585 --> 01:16:38.346]  That's coming up, too.
[01:16:38.406 --> 01:16:38.847]  Stay with us.
[01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:48.535]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:52.977]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:53.277 --> 01:16:53.817]  We listened.
[01:16:54.117 --> 01:16:59.100]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:16:59.860]  We listened.
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:03.281]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.722 --> 01:17:04.242]  We listened.
[01:17:04.702 --> 01:17:05.202]  We're good to go.
[01:17:05.222 --> 01:17:05.462]  I think?
[01:17:42.423 --> 01:17:44.724]  As a doctor, you're able to cure and heal your patients.
[01:17:44.965 --> 01:17:47.586]  Unfortunately, there's more than that to a successful medical practice.
[01:17:47.846 --> 01:17:52.689]  Confirming appointments, rescheduling missed visits, and sending reminders is inconvenient and time-consuming.
[01:17:52.889 --> 01:17:55.050]  A team of receptionists is a costly solution.
[01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:58.532]  GTI Technologies has an efficient and manageable answer.
[01:17:58.772 --> 01:17:59.453]  We're good to go.
[01:18:28.592 --> 01:18:29.212]  We're good to go.
[01:18:58.383 --> 01:19:11.673]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:19:12.193 --> 01:19:17.537]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:19:17.798 --> 01:19:23.702]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:20:42.969 --> 01:20:45.191]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:20:45.772 --> 01:20:48.674]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:51.336 --> 01:20:55.879]  Yeah, I don't want to get off into a bunch of tough guy talk, because the power's in the info ward.
[01:20:55.899 --> 01:21:12.032]  The pen is mightier than the sword, unless you've got all those avenues blocked from you and are cornered, but it was interesting because Dallas had a totally different culture, and especially out in Rockwall, Texas, you know, kind of the good old boys, and I guess it's
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:17.963]  I've been told it's always been like that, that people get in a lot of fights, and, you know, serious fights.
[01:21:17.983 --> 01:21:25.228]  I mean, you could be out at a bonfire and look at somebody wrong, and they'd be assaulting you with post hole diggers within ten seconds.
[01:21:26.308 --> 01:21:31.412]  And the few times I was halfway in the wrong getting in a fight, I got my hind end kicked.
[01:21:32.032 --> 01:21:35.234]  And, you know, it'd usually be somebody my size, just average size.
[01:21:37.135 --> 01:21:40.978]  But all the other times I got in fights, it was always a...
[01:21:43.343 --> 01:21:53.805]  Group of bullies or a particular bully who outweighed me by, in many cases, you know, 60, 70, 80 pounds, and I would try to stay out of the fight.
[01:21:53.846 --> 01:22:02.087]  As soon as they started assaulting me, I would basically just black out, and next thing I'd know there'd be police there and they'd be getting loaded in an ambulance.
[01:22:03.548 --> 01:22:08.469]  And I don't know, I guess it's instinctive for all of us that when we're cornered,
[01:22:09.515 --> 01:22:13.539]  That we have the strength to fight back and can do amazing things.
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:18.084]  But there's nothing that makes me madder than bullies.
[01:22:18.384 --> 01:22:19.985]  And I just can't stand them.
[01:22:20.186 --> 01:22:25.811]  And that's why it's very frustrating to watch them corner people and do the things they do to innocent people.
[01:22:26.592 --> 01:22:32.818]  It just makes my stomach turn and my mind burn with a righteous anger.
[01:22:33.835 --> 01:22:57.052]  And if you don't have those feelings about bullies and about dictators and about corrupt individuals, you're not connected to God, folks, because the Bible clearly shows that we should be outraged and disgusted by corruption, especially by bullies, by those that feed on the innocent, that feed on the widows.
[01:23:01.530 --> 01:23:02.731]  That's the word I'm looking for.
[01:23:03.431 --> 01:23:12.156]  So that's what I was trying to get at, and it's so important that we all get that righteous indignation at the lies and the corruption.
[01:23:12.717 --> 01:23:19.220]  But so much of the American society has just accepted that, oh, that's what politicians do.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.621]  Oh, they lie, cheat, and steal.
[01:23:20.661 --> 01:23:22.522]  Yeah, that's what the Houston Crime Lab does.
[01:23:22.542 --> 01:23:23.743]  It frames people.
[01:23:24.383 --> 01:23:25.704]  Yeah, that's what police do.
[01:23:25.744 --> 01:23:26.885]  They torture people now.
[01:23:27.835 --> 01:23:29.356]  And then no one's brought to justice.
[01:23:29.917 --> 01:23:35.140]  That has to change, or evil's going to win out and set itself up as the norm.
[01:23:35.781 --> 01:23:40.084]  And then it's going to come after the good at an even greater rate than it's doing now.
[01:23:40.864 --> 01:23:42.566]  We're going to break and come back and go to...
[01:23:44.375 --> 01:23:53.097]  Go to Dave and Daryl and Dwayne and Allie and Steve and Barney and many others that are holding.
[01:23:53.577 --> 01:23:56.438]  And that's all the calls I'm going to take for this hour coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:56.478 --> 01:24:00.179]  I'm going to go to the next segment, but I want to spend the last of the hour getting into some of the news.
[01:24:00.199 --> 01:24:03.680]  I want to spend the next few minutes getting into some of that news right now.
[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:10.021]  FBI denies failing to spot September 11th plot.
[01:24:10.722 --> 01:24:12.442]  That's their spin out of the Scotsman.
[01:24:13.084 --> 01:24:14.405]  Bush approval at 59.
[01:24:14.785 --> 01:24:16.586]  Democrats give edge on economy.
[01:24:18.307 --> 01:24:19.788]  Here's the story that started it all.
[01:24:19.948 --> 01:24:24.732]  AP report FBI informant new 911 hijackers.
[01:24:25.572 --> 01:24:27.874]  And this was their big new breaking story.
[01:24:27.894 --> 01:24:29.535]  This came out a year and a half ago.
[01:24:29.975 --> 01:24:34.378]  This came out about 22 months ago, within a week of September 11th,
[01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:40.175]  We even had heard about it before, but specifics came out after September 11th, right after it.
[01:24:40.455 --> 01:24:54.428]  We have all the news articles posted on Infowars.com and presentplanet.com that most of the hijackers, it looks like 12 of them, of the 19, had their houses, their cars, their credit cards paid for by the FBI.
[01:24:55.663 --> 01:25:06.692]  In two of the houses, one in Florida, one in California, where at least five of the hijackers live, the supposed hijackers, the FBI had informants or agents living with them.
[01:25:08.093 --> 01:25:13.157]  Now, I've got MSNBC AP Reuters on this from the weeks after 9-1-1.
[01:25:13.217 --> 01:25:14.899]  Everybody's supposed to forget about it.
[01:25:15.239 --> 01:25:16.320]  You never hear about it in the news.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:24.106]  Well, this is the big report by the Whitewashing Committee, but they say it's all an accident, the FBI didn't mean to, and they just need more funding.
[01:25:25.294 --> 01:25:28.417]  And the higher-ups blocked the investigation, but they were stupid.
[01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:31.239]  And then the article doesn't mention what past articles said.
[01:25:31.539 --> 01:25:43.089]  We put the news together that the five, or was it six, FBI agents, five or six, I've got to dig that article out, all got big fat bonuses.
[01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:49.034]  They had a Washington Times article, several others, where they all got record cash bonuses, $30,000, $15,000, $20,000 apiece, for blocking the investigations.
[01:25:54.594 --> 01:25:55.634]  Not reprimanded.
[01:25:56.335 --> 01:25:57.095]  Rewarded.
[01:25:58.896 --> 01:26:04.938]  So, again, when you've got all these news articles, and you've got this whole story put together, and then you hear their spin, it's incredible.
[01:26:04.998 --> 01:26:07.479]  It's very frustrating, and again, makes me angry.
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:13.541]  So, report FBI informant new 911 hijackers.
[01:26:13.581 --> 01:26:14.822]  That's coming up in detail.
[01:26:14.982 --> 01:26:18.743]  Exclusive, the 911 report slamming the FBI, MSNBC.
[01:26:19.504 --> 01:26:22.465]  Also, how the government's hiring mercenary teams in Afghanistan.
[01:26:23.769 --> 01:26:29.154]  Cuba, the U.S., Iraq, you name it, and why that's so dangerous.
[01:26:29.594 --> 01:26:30.856]  First your calls and we get back.
[01:26:33.338 --> 01:26:34.239]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.719 --> 01:26:36.341]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.262 --> 01:26:39.945]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.095 --> 01:26:46.138]  Heart disease continues to be a leading cause of death in America.
[01:26:46.579 --> 01:26:46.879]  Why?
[01:26:47.359 --> 01:26:50.082]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?
[01:26:50.262 --> 01:26:53.766]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and... 803-4438.
[01:26:53.786 --> 01:26:55.267]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:27:13.793 --> 01:27:27.619]  All right, let's get through the callers, and then I'm going to get into the news on September 11th on lies of weapons of mass destruction and the counter lies that the globalists spew once they get caught lying.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:33.282]  But let's go ahead and talk to Daniel in Georgia.
[01:27:33.322 --> 01:27:34.263]  Daniel, you're on the air.
[01:27:34.303 --> 01:27:34.723]  Go ahead.
[01:27:34.743 --> 01:27:36.804]  Is this Alex Jones?
[01:27:36.924 --> 01:27:37.724]  Yes, sir, it is.
[01:27:38.525 --> 01:27:41.586]  Mr. Jones, pleasure to talk to you.
[01:27:42.482 --> 01:27:50.206]  I have been listening to you on the net since like, oh, 98, 99, something like that.
[01:27:50.226 --> 01:27:59.370]  I appreciate the work you did with the Branch Davidians in helping to rebuild their church.
[01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:01.891]  Well, I want to thank the listeners.
[01:28:01.931 --> 01:28:03.832]  We built them a church that seats 400, two-story.
[01:28:06.231 --> 01:28:12.155]  Made out of hardy plank and then treated so it can't be burned down or fire retardant.
[01:28:12.675 --> 01:28:16.338]  And we built that as a memorial for those that died, yes.
[01:28:16.638 --> 01:28:17.298]  Yes, you did.
[01:28:17.879 --> 01:28:25.043]  And I happen to be personal friends with Clive and the recently departed Edna and Sheila and the rest of them.
[01:28:25.704 --> 01:28:33.569]  And, you know, I can say that, you know, everybody thanks you from their heart because what you did was a really good thing.
[01:28:35.104 --> 01:28:36.464]  But again, I didn't do it.
[01:28:37.725 --> 01:28:47.292]  I got tired of the Davidians getting the shaft when it came to the civil trials, the judge not allowing a jury.
[01:28:47.452 --> 01:28:50.134]  See, that was before 9-1-1 and the Patriot Act, folks.
[01:28:50.154 --> 01:28:50.995]  They're already doing it.
[01:28:51.495 --> 01:28:59.501]  I got tired of everybody talking, and so with the charity we set up, we said send the money to the three hardware stores
[01:29:00.762 --> 01:29:05.866]  Ian, we set up accounts, and I would announce each day we need 100 boards of this size.
[01:29:06.346 --> 01:29:08.128]  We need 100 pieces of sheetrock.
[01:29:08.628 --> 01:29:12.471]  Pull this number to this Lowe's or this Home Depot or this McCoy's.
[01:29:13.131 --> 01:29:23.699]  Pull now, and every dime, and I gave over $1,400 of my own money, every dime went to build that, and we raised over $120,000 by the end of it.
[01:29:28.016 --> 01:29:40.965]  Yes, you did, and again, on behalf of the Branchividians, or actually they call themselves something else, but the point is that what you did was a very great thing.
[01:29:41.245 --> 01:29:42.166]  But the listeners did it.
[01:29:42.786 --> 01:29:45.968]  Well, actually, through you, the listeners did it.
[01:29:46.589 --> 01:29:51.952]  But what I'm trying to say is that I am a mainstream guy, okay?
[01:29:52.913 --> 01:29:54.194]  I happen to own property...
[01:29:54.895 --> 01:30:02.737]  I happen to be in the business community and I listen to you whenever I can because I find your information highly informative.
[01:30:04.058 --> 01:30:14.240]  When I research your information, I find it to be like 99 to 100% correct and I find no fault with the information that you give out on the radio.
[01:30:15.101 --> 01:30:23.103]  I'm just trying to figure out, and this is just from a regular guy, what is it you're trying to accomplish?
[01:30:24.983 --> 01:30:29.124]  The United States Constitution does not exist anymore, okay?
[01:30:29.724 --> 01:30:34.065]  The America of the 20s and 30s and 40s doesn't exist.
[01:30:37.526 --> 01:30:38.646]  We didn't hang up on you.
[01:30:40.107 --> 01:30:40.787]  That's weird.
[01:30:42.027 --> 01:30:43.567]  Sounds like he got disconnected.
[01:30:43.587 --> 01:30:49.769]  If Daniel tries to call back in, Mark, tell me and I'll get him back up on the air.
[01:30:50.797 --> 01:30:51.978]  Sounds like his phone cut out.
[01:30:52.498 --> 01:30:55.700]  But I can hear where his question or his statement was going.
[01:30:57.101 --> 01:30:57.962]  Things are bad.
[01:30:58.662 --> 01:31:01.624]  The government is illegitimate and is destroying America.
[01:31:03.185 --> 01:31:06.848]  And things aren't going to get any better if we quit doing this radio show.
[01:31:06.908 --> 01:31:08.569]  In fact, they're going to get worse a lot quicker.
[01:31:09.922 --> 01:31:20.711]  And Alaska, Republican-controlled statehouse, just passed a law decrying the Patriot Act, listing the subsections that violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:31:21.131 --> 01:31:22.793]  And Ashcroft can lie all day.
[01:31:22.833 --> 01:31:24.374]  The neocon liberally is.
[01:31:24.814 --> 01:31:25.975]  It isn't going to work for him.
[01:31:27.096 --> 01:31:29.198]  Hawaii's done the same, a liberal state.
[01:31:29.278 --> 01:31:31.520]  It's over 400 cities and towns, not 180, not 250, not 300.
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.340]  Months ago, I counted them all up.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:32.841]  It was over 402 states.
[01:31:39.565 --> 01:31:40.946]  There's a solution right there.
[01:31:41.146 --> 01:31:43.348]  There's what our educational program has done.
[01:31:43.368 --> 01:31:47.310]  And that's for all patriots, not just this show.
[01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:48.371]  We're a small part of that.
[01:31:48.631 --> 01:31:51.373]  Overall, move to educate and alert the people.
[01:31:53.034 --> 01:32:00.759]  And we've got 99% of firemen and police and doctors and medical workers refusing the smallpox shot.
[01:32:00.819 --> 01:32:01.920]  That's the LA Times.
[01:32:02.941 --> 01:32:06.423]  Out of 10 million they wanted to vaccinate, 296 did it.
[01:32:07.244 --> 01:32:08.485]  That's LA Times a few months ago.
[01:32:08.525 --> 01:32:08.805]  Now it's
[01:32:09.674 --> 01:32:11.055]  Maybe 1,000 that have taken it.
[01:32:12.296 --> 01:32:20.042]  Out of 20,000 that were ordered to report to take it or lose their jobs in Connecticut, firemen, police, medical workers, four showed up.
[01:32:20.082 --> 01:32:21.123]  That's the Associated Press.
[01:32:22.624 --> 01:32:23.885]  And those numbers are a few months old.
[01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:27.328]  The program's been going on for over a year, so I guess a few more have probably taken it now.
[01:32:27.388 --> 01:32:31.151]  I've seen a few articles but can't recall the numbers, but it's still very low numbers.
[01:32:31.171 --> 01:32:39.197]  99-plus percent are refusing, despite the government saying it's wonderful, like mother's milk for you, their deadly smallpox shot.
[01:32:41.578 --> 01:32:47.160]  They've tried to ban guns in this country, and Bill Clinton and the liberals were swept out of office because of it.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:53.681]  So now Bush is Trojan-horsing us and trying to do even worse stuff, and the neocons are covering that up.
[01:32:53.741 --> 01:32:55.442]  That's where we have the crisis point.
[01:32:55.462 --> 01:32:58.783]  Because folks don't look at action, they look at rhetoric.
[01:32:58.803 --> 01:32:59.683]  We're trying to change that.
[01:33:00.323 --> 01:33:01.523]  There's a bunch of other examples.
[01:33:01.543 --> 01:33:06.245]  They wanted to have Henry Kissinger head up the 9-1-1 committee, and that blew up in their face.
[01:33:06.285 --> 01:33:07.445]  They had to get him off of there.
[01:33:09.062 --> 01:33:10.203]  There's a bunch of examples.
[01:33:10.263 --> 01:33:13.425]  Maybe listeners should chime in with your example of where we're backing them off.
[01:33:13.465 --> 01:33:22.612]  They passed a law in Texas last month stating that the law states that you don't have to vaccinate your kids, so why is CPS coming out of people that don't?
[01:33:23.693 --> 01:33:24.834]  Child grabbing services.
[01:33:25.655 --> 01:33:27.756]  And so the new law says CPS can't do that.
[01:33:28.377 --> 01:33:28.957]  It's a crime.
[01:33:29.317 --> 01:33:29.818]  Well, no kidding.
[01:33:29.838 --> 01:33:33.881]  It was a crime beforehand, but they had to pass a law telling these criminals to stop it.
[01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:35.182]  There's another victory.
[01:33:37.138 --> 01:33:42.902]  The big Eli Lilly just lost a big lawsuit over their Lyme's disease vaccine that hurt a bunch of people.
[01:33:43.042 --> 01:33:45.123]  I mean, these victories are all over the place.
[01:33:46.864 --> 01:33:50.186]  And they're reported in the back of the newspaper or deep in some newswire.
[01:33:50.587 --> 01:33:52.908]  We take those articles reported in the back of the paper.
[01:33:53.228 --> 01:33:57.091]  We make them front page on this show and inform millions of people.
[01:33:58.672 --> 01:34:03.635]  I mean, I've gone the last eight years from an access TV show and one radio show once a week on local FM...
[01:34:05.242 --> 01:34:17.026]  To being on dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of AM and FM stations, simulcasting on shortwave, one of the biggest internet listening audiences, and I've reached tens of millions of people.
[01:34:17.066 --> 01:34:18.626]  I've done over a thousand radio interviews.
[01:34:18.966 --> 01:34:25.128]  I, just in my own little ministry, have woken up millions of people thanks to you getting my videos and making copies of them.
[01:34:27.129 --> 01:34:28.409]  Let's talk to Dwayne in Texas.
[01:34:28.449 --> 01:34:29.409]  Dwayne, you're on the air.
[01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:30.510]  Alex.
[01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:31.230]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:31.690 --> 01:34:32.410]  Doing all right today?
[01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:33.031]  Pretty good.
[01:34:33.611 --> 01:34:34.271]  I'm calling you from...
[01:34:34.913 --> 01:34:36.995]  East of Buffalo, about an hour and a half.
[01:34:38.696 --> 01:34:39.117]  Still there?
[01:34:39.457 --> 01:34:39.737]  Yes.
[01:34:40.498 --> 01:34:48.464]  And I just wanted to say that I really appreciate your tireless efforts to freedom and to waking a lot of people up.
[01:34:48.664 --> 01:34:49.805]  Well, it's about survival.
[01:34:49.865 --> 01:34:50.966]  This is about survival.
[01:34:51.547 --> 01:34:51.867]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:52.548 --> 01:34:53.208]  No doubt about it.
[01:34:53.288 --> 01:34:54.910]  I'm kind of ashamed I don't work harder.
[01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:59.033]  Well, your tireless efforts are greatly appreciated.
[01:34:59.874 --> 01:35:02.556]  And when you were talking earlier about getting sick, about having to...
[01:35:03.448 --> 01:35:05.029]  Watch all this stuff on TV.
[01:35:06.370 --> 01:35:07.351]  I know the feeling.
[01:35:08.651 --> 01:35:12.053]  Just never forget to pull on your power, you know, where it's coming from.
[01:35:12.514 --> 01:35:13.334]  Our Lord and Savior.
[01:35:14.515 --> 01:35:16.336]  There's no doubt that's where your energy comes from.
[01:35:17.257 --> 01:35:17.857]  Absolutely.
[01:35:17.917 --> 01:35:18.537]  Amen to that.
[01:35:18.938 --> 01:35:22.960]  Anyway, I live here in a house that my great-grandfather built in 1908.
[01:35:24.581 --> 01:35:26.382]  And a lot of my folks were veterans.
[01:35:27.263 --> 01:35:31.826]  Fought in Germany, Italy, Iwo Jima, and...
[01:35:32.569 --> 01:35:35.171]  I just want you to know and other people to know that I'll never forget that.
[01:35:37.013 --> 01:35:44.619]  And I am willing to repel my borders and to put up the good fight for freedom.
[01:35:46.221 --> 01:35:51.605]  But just so many people have got their head in the sand nowadays.
[01:35:52.226 --> 01:35:52.827]  It's terrible.
[01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:53.948]  It is.
[01:35:55.429 --> 01:35:57.150]  And they do it at their own peril.
[01:35:57.250 --> 01:35:59.032]  They're guaranteed destruction.
[01:35:59.915 --> 01:36:01.775]  Well, like I say, it's terrible.
[01:36:01.935 --> 01:36:04.296]  But one of these days, everybody's going to get woke up, I'm sure.
[01:36:04.656 --> 01:36:07.857]  It's already happening, but Peter Jennings isn't going to tell us we're winning.
[01:36:07.897 --> 01:36:09.437]  Sir, we're winning.
[01:36:09.797 --> 01:36:12.017]  That's what makes the globalists so dangerous right now.
[01:36:12.297 --> 01:36:14.618]  Oh, yeah, no doubt about your television.
[01:36:15.318 --> 01:36:22.099]  One thing I did see on our local NBC up there in Tyler, they've got a new federal police program going up there.
[01:36:22.119 --> 01:36:24.820]  It's called STEP, federally funded.
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:25.740]  And I was sent...
[01:36:27.034 --> 01:36:30.138]  The STEP and the SLAT program by police.
[01:36:31.099 --> 01:36:31.719]  Tell them about it.
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:33.501]  Well, what it is, they're going to be...
[01:36:34.778 --> 01:36:40.182]  You know, please, they're going to be checking people for DWI, is what they said on the news.
[01:36:40.442 --> 01:36:43.665]  But the actual plan says it has nothing to do with DWIs.
[01:36:43.745 --> 01:36:46.567]  It's an excuse to train us to accept checkpoints.
[01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:47.188]  Correct.
[01:36:47.608 --> 01:36:51.851]  It's also part three of the four-part National Seatbelt Initiative plan.
[01:36:52.212 --> 01:36:56.035]  They state it is about training you for internal checkpoints.
[01:36:56.635 --> 01:36:57.476]  Right.
[01:36:57.676 --> 01:36:58.456]  No doubt about that.
[01:36:58.536 --> 01:37:00.078]  And it's about federalizing police.
[01:37:00.778 --> 01:37:02.880]  Well, people just don't see it.
[01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:07.510]  More of them are saying it's a... Well, a lot of people are.
[01:37:07.691 --> 01:37:11.939]  Thanks to you and other people and the tireless efforts of other people that listen to your program.
[01:37:13.045 --> 01:37:14.226]  A lot of people are waking up.
[01:37:14.266 --> 01:37:15.587]  Yeah, that's where the power comes from.
[01:37:15.667 --> 01:37:27.873]  The listeners of this show and other like-minded shows that love America, don't get involved and don't become leaders and don't run for city council and don't make copies of documentary films and don't hand out booklets and don't get involved.
[01:37:27.893 --> 01:37:28.974]  We're going to lose this country.
[01:37:29.154 --> 01:37:30.815]  We've already lost most of it.
[01:37:31.075 --> 01:37:32.155]  People are waking up.
[01:37:32.376 --> 01:37:33.676]  The battle's been joined, folks.
[01:37:33.716 --> 01:37:35.437]  We need you to not stand by idle.
[01:37:36.438 --> 01:37:38.799]  Well, you know, freedom's a strong thing and...
[01:37:40.996 --> 01:37:48.501]  One of these days when people realize it and they're going to be willing to fight for freedom, I feel like the globalists and the Illuminati and all them, they're going to have a fight on their hands.
[01:37:49.522 --> 01:37:50.882]  They do have a fight on their hands.
[01:37:50.942 --> 01:37:51.563]  Yes, sir, no doubt about it.
[01:37:51.583 --> 01:37:53.404]  That's why I'm putting the total control grid in.
[01:37:53.424 --> 01:37:54.345]  Thanks for the call, Dwayne.
[01:37:54.545 --> 01:37:55.305]  Okay, thank you, sir.
[01:37:55.686 --> 01:37:56.166]  You bet.
[01:37:56.346 --> 01:38:05.012]  And Daryl, or Daniel, I can't get my name straight ever, a lot of D's today in Georgia.
[01:38:05.552 --> 01:38:06.332]  He got disconnected.
[01:38:06.372 --> 01:38:06.933]  He's back on.
[01:38:06.973 --> 01:38:07.573]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:38:09.574 --> 01:38:09.935]  You were...
[01:38:10.973 --> 01:38:15.855]  You were bringing up about how America's basically gone, so what can we do about it?
[01:38:15.875 --> 01:38:16.235]  Go ahead.
[01:38:17.315 --> 01:38:22.177]  No, Alex, actually, I was not saying that.
[01:38:22.677 --> 01:38:34.842]  What I'm saying is that having listened to your show for at least five, six years now, it's like I have to go back to the late 90s, and it's like I...
[01:38:38.095 --> 01:38:41.756]  A friend of mine turned me on to your show, and it's like, yeah, this guy's a nut.
[01:38:42.196 --> 01:38:42.936]  But guess what?
[01:38:43.056 --> 01:38:46.997]  When I researched what you said, this guy is not a nut.
[01:38:47.397 --> 01:38:57.380]  You know, he is telling the truth, and it's like I have basically been following you throughout the years.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.561]  But what I'm trying to find out is, like, look.
[01:39:00.961 --> 01:39:04.202]  You were saying the Constitution's gone, and then your phone cut out.
[01:39:04.222 --> 01:39:05.062]  What are you trying to say?
[01:39:05.675 --> 01:39:09.958]  What I'm trying to say is that what you are saying is the truth.
[01:39:10.458 --> 01:39:15.342]  All this nonsense that is going on today is the absolute truth.
[01:39:15.982 --> 01:39:23.607]  But there's nothing we can do about it because of the simple fact that there's nothing we can do about it.
[01:39:24.928 --> 01:39:30.412]  Well, that's... Sir, you may have missed what I said in response to... See, that's where you were going.
[01:39:30.432 --> 01:39:31.072]  That's what you said.
[01:39:31.092 --> 01:39:32.013]  Look...
[01:39:34.671 --> 01:39:39.273]  If we weren't here fighting it, things would be 10, 20 times worse.
[01:39:40.114 --> 01:39:46.978]  If we weren't fighting RFIDs, Walmart wouldn't have suspended, for now, the implementation of the tracker chips and goods.
[01:39:47.558 --> 01:39:52.961]  But they are suspending it for now, and we all know they're going to take it up later.
[01:39:52.981 --> 01:39:54.642]  Sir, sir, it's a war.
[01:39:54.982 --> 01:39:56.382]  We're winning a lot of battles.
[01:39:56.763 --> 01:39:59.624]  And then we get discouraged when the enemy launches another attack?
[01:39:59.884 --> 01:40:00.985]  That's what war is.
[01:40:02.119 --> 01:40:04.521]  But you see, we are not in a war.
[01:40:07.563 --> 01:40:22.715]  Well, yes, we are in an information war, and the revolutionaries of the New World Order, the Illuminists, are trying to overthrow our republic and replace it with a high-tech, casual society slave grid, and we are winning a lot of the fight, sir.
[01:40:22.755 --> 01:40:24.156]  We're losing a lot of the fight, too.
[01:40:24.636 --> 01:40:25.417]  But we're in the fight.
[01:40:27.168 --> 01:40:28.788]  Alex Jones, you know what?
[01:40:29.188 --> 01:40:31.669]  You are a gem, okay?
[01:40:31.729 --> 01:40:42.111]  Because you have a radio show and you can broadcast the truth and you are one of those people that is a rarity in society, okay?
[01:40:42.611 --> 01:40:45.092]  But the problem is, is you don't understand.
[01:40:45.412 --> 01:40:55.474]  When I talk to my peers, okay, and I have money, I mean, I'm one of the mainstream type of guys here out here, and it's like when I talk to them,
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:00.884]  They admit, they understand they are under rule.
[01:41:01.284 --> 01:41:01.684]  Okay?
[01:41:01.944 --> 01:41:02.825]  They understand that.
[01:41:03.105 --> 01:41:03.786]  But guess what?
[01:41:03.826 --> 01:41:04.706]  They got stuff.
[01:41:05.187 --> 01:41:06.248]  And that is the problem.
[01:41:08.129 --> 01:41:13.974]  The average American today does not understand that freedom is not...
[01:41:17.097 --> 01:41:17.517]  I understand.
[01:41:17.557 --> 01:41:18.438]  I see where you're going.
[01:41:18.658 --> 01:41:20.899]  Sir, Daniel, I see where you're going, and thanks for the call.
[01:41:20.919 --> 01:41:25.821]  Let me just say this to what you had to say, and then I'm going to take a few calls and try to cram some more news in before this hour ends.
[01:41:25.861 --> 01:41:29.943]  But let me try to break down the problem here with what you're saying.
[01:41:30.103 --> 01:41:30.783]  I understand it.
[01:41:30.863 --> 01:41:31.323]  It's true.
[01:41:32.364 --> 01:41:38.887]  A lot of people who are comfortable, who are intelligent, will admit this is happening, but they'll say that's the way it's always been.
[01:41:38.927 --> 01:41:40.147]  There's nothing you can do about it.
[01:41:40.187 --> 01:41:41.428]  You can't fight City Hall.
[01:41:41.908 --> 01:41:45.730]  They will regurgitate that Tokyo Rose propaganda of lay down G.I.,
[01:41:48.268 --> 01:41:51.010]  But the good news is we don't need everyone.
[01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:53.752]  We don't even need a large minority.
[01:41:53.772 --> 01:41:59.977]  3% started and won the Revolutionary War of 1776.
[01:42:02.359 --> 01:42:05.902]  We need men and women to set bushfires in the minds of others.
[01:42:06.082 --> 01:42:06.842]  And that has happened.
[01:42:06.862 --> 01:42:07.983]  And we are well over 3%.
[01:42:08.424 --> 01:42:12.026]  10% are patriots or constitutionalists.
[01:42:12.467 --> 01:42:15.289]  Our problem is about 1% of those are active.
[01:42:15.309 --> 01:42:16.530]  And I mean really active.
[01:42:18.650 --> 01:42:20.472]  So we have more numbers than they did in 1776.
[01:42:20.693 --> 01:42:25.058]  And I've talked to Colonel Roberts many times on this show.
[01:42:25.638 --> 01:42:29.803]  Marine Corps sniper, Vietnam veteran, Army intelligence colonel.
[01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:35.770]  He said five, ten years ago he'd be at the deer camp with 30 state police and
[01:42:36.875 --> 01:42:41.999]  Local police and maybe a fed or two, they'd all laugh at him about the New World Order that didn't exist.
[01:42:42.119 --> 01:42:43.120]  They needed more power.
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:48.304]  He says everyone at the deer camp now, and it's like 40-something people, he said.
[01:42:48.344 --> 01:42:48.945]  It's grown.
[01:42:49.305 --> 01:42:50.446]  The deer camp he's been going to.
[01:42:50.966 --> 01:42:51.967]  Now they all agree.
[01:42:52.007 --> 01:42:53.448]  They're all talking about the New World Order.
[01:42:53.468 --> 01:42:55.109]  They're all talking about 9-1-1.
[01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:56.350]  They know who did it.
[01:42:56.611 --> 01:42:57.852]  You know what a big deal that is?
[01:42:57.872 --> 01:42:59.433]  And I get the same thing from cops on the streets.
[01:43:00.054 --> 01:43:10.957]  For every stupid shaved head thug with tattoos all over him on a power trip harassing your wife or girlfriend when you're downtown, there's five or ten of them that are awake and know something's wrong.
[01:43:11.197 --> 01:43:13.458]  They just don't know the full ramifications.
[01:43:15.999 --> 01:43:17.699]  So I'm telling you, we're winning this fight.
[01:43:17.899 --> 01:43:18.559]  Bottom line.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.640]  And we don't need everybody.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:22.881]  And I'm telling you, move on.
[01:43:22.921 --> 01:43:26.902]  If somebody says, yeah, I know this is true, but I don't care.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:30.362]  You ought to say, well, you're going to care when they take everything you've got.
[01:43:30.462 --> 01:43:36.566]  And then later, the tyranny is going to be water on those seeds and sunshine on those seeds, and they're going to sprout.
[01:43:37.546 --> 01:43:38.807]  I'm like Johnny Appleseed.
[01:43:38.847 --> 01:43:47.293]  I'm just out there planting the seeds to get people to take a closer look, to look at things from another angle, to realize history, and to get them going on their own.
[01:43:47.933 --> 01:43:53.357]  And there's people five years ago that didn't believe me that have now woken up and are fighting the New World Order.
[01:43:54.557 --> 01:43:56.759]  Let's go ahead and take calls.
[01:43:57.446 --> 01:44:00.647]  Let's talk to Allie in Oklahoma.
[01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:01.308]  Go ahead, Allie.
[01:44:01.488 --> 01:44:01.988]  Hi, Alex.
[01:44:02.188 --> 01:44:02.688]  How you doing?
[01:44:03.509 --> 01:44:04.249]  We need some help.
[01:44:05.809 --> 01:44:19.255]  A nearby small town is attempting to annex a bunch of farms into the city, and they're trying to annex 17 full sections and parts of four of the sections, and it's over 11,000 acres.
[01:44:19.575 --> 01:44:23.737]  And then they'll pass regulations and... Sure they will.
[01:44:24.177 --> 01:44:25.317]  But we're pretty well...
[01:44:27.825 --> 01:44:30.847]  I think we're going to take care of that part.
[01:44:31.468 --> 01:44:44.757]  But what I want to know is how to go about getting this Bill of Rights Restoration Act brought up to the city while we're in there at this meeting with them over this annexation.
[01:44:45.338 --> 01:44:51.362]  Maybe we can bring up this Bill of Rights Restoration Act, and I don't know how to even start it.
[01:44:51.442 --> 01:44:52.123]  Stay there.
[01:44:52.283 --> 01:44:52.823]  Stay there.
[01:44:53.283 --> 01:44:54.224]  This is important, Allie.
[01:44:54.244 --> 01:44:54.785]  Don't hang up.
[01:44:54.805 --> 01:44:56.526]  I'll tell you how to do it on the other side.
[01:44:57.828 --> 01:44:59.490]  And then we'll launch into more of the news.
[01:44:59.570 --> 01:45:01.251]  It's all on InfoWars.com.
[01:45:01.271 --> 01:45:03.033]  Stay with us.
[01:45:05.455 --> 01:45:11.381]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[01:46:03.314 --> 01:46:14.058]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:46:14.218 --> 01:46:21.821]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:22.081 --> 01:46:25.223]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:46:25.483 --> 01:46:31.185]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:46:31.505 --> 01:46:37.669]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:46:38.009 --> 01:46:41.912]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:46:41.972 --> 01:46:43.853]  The water level is always visible.
[01:46:44.013 --> 01:46:49.997]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:46:50.218 --> 01:46:54.480]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:47:03.767 --> 01:47:06.689]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:47:07.369 --> 01:47:08.670]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:14.614]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:47:14.874 --> 01:47:20.158]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:47:20.438 --> 01:47:24.541]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:47:24.741 --> 01:47:28.526]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:47:28.786 --> 01:47:33.432]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:47:33.512 --> 01:47:39.780]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.603]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:47:42.043 --> 01:47:42.924]  We're good to go.
[01:48:11.237 --> 01:48:13.598]  We are accelerating towards the third hour.
[01:48:13.638 --> 01:48:14.859]  Thank you for joining us today.
[01:48:14.879 --> 01:48:25.283]  Allie, you want to know how to bring forward my resolution, the Save the Bill of Rights campaign that's been passed by some cities and towns.
[01:48:25.323 --> 01:48:28.544]  There are many other resolutions.
[01:48:28.604 --> 01:48:29.665]  Some are weaker.
[01:48:29.985 --> 01:48:33.206]  A few others might be a little bit stronger than mine, though I doubt it.
[01:48:34.747 --> 01:48:36.828]  You'll find a like-minded city council member
[01:48:37.822 --> 01:48:38.022]  Well, okay.
[01:48:56.238 --> 01:48:58.159]  Conservatives in Alaska are doing this.
[01:48:58.779 --> 01:49:00.379]  They're trying to do it in Salt Lake City.
[01:49:00.419 --> 01:49:02.740]  Conservative towns around Salt Lake are passing it.
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:05.661]  You show them conservative towns in Florida doing it.
[01:49:06.041 --> 01:49:09.602]  And you say, this is a conservative issue because they're going to try to say it's a liberal issue.
[01:49:09.622 --> 01:49:12.063]  They try to do that in the media and balkanize things.
[01:49:12.623 --> 01:49:20.325]  And you say, we want you to simply say the Bill of Rights and Constitution are still in effect in this county and town and that you're going to stand up for it.
[01:49:20.925 --> 01:49:21.325]  We're good to go.
[01:49:50.294 --> 01:49:51.975]  And in power in your city or town.
[01:49:52.916 --> 01:49:57.919]  But, Alex, I have to have the exact location of where to get this information.
[01:49:58.479 --> 01:49:59.099]  Okay, let me tell you.
[01:49:59.119 --> 01:49:59.720]  Let me tell you.
[01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:00.420]  Let me tell you.
[01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:05.563]  On InfoWars.com, there's the Save the Bill of Rights campaign.
[01:50:05.643 --> 01:50:07.044]  Big old link there on the page.
[01:50:07.364 --> 01:50:10.266]  It's also at PrisonPlanet.com down on the left-hand side.
[01:50:10.286 --> 01:50:12.447]  It says Save the Bill of Rights campaign.
[01:50:12.827 --> 01:50:16.790]  You print that, and on the main page today, I printed it off.
[01:50:16.850 --> 01:50:17.810]  It should have been posted.
[01:50:17.890 --> 01:50:18.651]  I'm sure it is.
[01:50:19.491 --> 01:50:21.712]  Yeah, because it's in the Ashcroft section today.
[01:50:22.092 --> 01:50:26.294]  We have the Anchorage Daily News saying just what I reported.
[01:50:26.554 --> 01:50:27.054]  Yeah, okay.
[01:50:27.094 --> 01:50:30.096]  Well, I don't know the date of the newspaper or anything.
[01:50:30.196 --> 01:50:31.216]  Ma'am, let me tell you.
[01:50:31.356 --> 01:50:33.277]  But it's going to be up there on the website, huh?
[01:50:33.597 --> 01:50:35.078]  Yes, this is July 22nd.
[01:50:35.778 --> 01:50:47.203]  Kate Peswecker and Nicole Tassong, Tuffin Patriot Act Attorney General says, controversy of law gives Attorney General broader powers.
[01:50:48.250 --> 01:50:49.450]  Here's another one.
[01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:50.471]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:50:50.971 --> 01:50:51.811]  Anchorage, Alaska.
[01:50:51.831 --> 01:50:54.171]  Attorney General John Ashcroft on Monday defended the U.S.
[01:50:54.211 --> 01:50:54.811]  Patriot Act.
[01:50:55.231 --> 01:51:02.053]  Down at the bottom, Republican-controlled state legislature in Alaska has approved a resolution condemning the act as an infringement on civil liberties.
[01:51:02.393 --> 01:51:06.554]  And then we have the law I've written posted on the site as well.
[01:51:07.254 --> 01:51:07.514]  I see.
[01:51:07.614 --> 01:51:07.974]  Okay.
[01:51:07.994 --> 01:51:08.574]  Well, that's a tip.
[01:51:08.874 --> 01:51:12.375]  And how about the copies of the...
[01:51:13.863 --> 01:51:16.444]  Patriot Act and info on the Patriot Act 2.
[01:51:17.505 --> 01:51:18.245]  Will that be on here?
[01:51:18.265 --> 01:51:24.488]  There's a big link at the top of the main page that says Alex Jones analysis of Patriot Act 2.
[01:51:24.528 --> 01:51:25.068]  Thanks for the call.
[01:51:25.809 --> 01:51:26.669]  Really appreciate it.
[01:51:27.149 --> 01:51:35.153]  And by the way, if you want to wake your city council up, your county commissioners, give them a copy of Police State 3 Total Enslavement or The Road to Tyranny.
[01:51:35.253 --> 01:51:39.375]  Get my videos, make copies, and give it to all of them.

[01:52:20.118 --> 01:52:22.560]  We authorize you to make copies for not-for-sale purposes.
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:23.880]  Please get them today.
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:24.701]  1-888-253-3139.

[01:52:33.937 --> 01:52:34.658]  All right.
[01:52:34.818 --> 01:52:36.039]  Callers, you're going to have to hold.
[01:52:36.059 --> 01:52:37.159]  I want to get straight into the news.
[01:52:37.199 --> 01:52:39.781]  I haven't covered yet, or I've only mentioned briefly, in the third hour.
[01:52:40.301 --> 01:52:45.645]  Then about 20 minutes into the hour, I'm going to take calls for the rest of the show with a recap of top stories at the end of the broadcast.
[01:52:46.045 --> 01:52:47.066]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:52:47.086 --> 01:52:49.687]  If your station doesn't carry it, ask them why.
[01:52:49.708 --> 01:52:50.768]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:50.788 --> 01:52:51.229]  Stay with me.
[01:52:55.131 --> 01:52:58.233]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:52:58.513 --> 01:53:01.095]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio
[01:53:04.869 --> 01:53:12.276]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.783 --> 01:53:20.443]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.104 --> 01:53:22.185]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.865 --> 01:53:24.026]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.046 --> 01:53:25.388]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.195 --> 01:53:27.056]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.076 --> 01:53:31.718]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.938 --> 01:53:36.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.761 --> 01:53:38.661]  All right, folks.
[01:53:38.901 --> 01:53:43.804]  Already into the third and final hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:48.566]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[01:53:49.181 --> 01:53:51.604]  And then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:53:51.624 --> 01:54:02.375]  You can always listen via the Internet at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or on Global Shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 at 12.172 or 9320 and at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 or 6890.
[01:54:10.938 --> 01:54:14.480]  Sherry and others, Barney and others that are patiently holding.
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:16.541]  Your calls are coming up in about 20 minutes if you can hold.
[01:54:16.561 --> 01:54:19.003]  Because I've got news I need to cover now.
[01:54:20.824 --> 01:54:23.145]  The toll-free number to join us on air.
[01:54:23.205 --> 01:54:24.226]  Always a good idea to give it out.
[01:54:24.246 --> 01:54:25.406]  I haven't given it out in over an hour.
[01:54:25.426 --> 01:54:25.487]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:42.837]  Any particular news or story we haven't mentioned, or something you saw on the news you want to talk about, or something you witnessed on C-SPAN, or something happening locally in your area, we'd love to hear from you on those issues as well.
[01:54:42.857 --> 01:54:44.778]  800-259-9231, and we will get you up and on the air.
[01:54:44.798 --> 01:54:46.179]  Okay, there's a bunch of news.
[01:54:54.529 --> 01:54:56.390]  Later, I'm going to recap this because it's so important.
[01:54:56.410 --> 01:54:58.131]  I'm about to cover other news we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:54:58.311 --> 01:55:04.574]  Ashcroft has been lying and then caught in lies and issuing new lies, mixing it with half-truths and then combining it with more lies.
[01:55:04.594 --> 01:55:07.815]  I mean, he makes Bill Clinton look like a poor liar.
[01:55:08.356 --> 01:55:14.679]  We'll get into what this puppet's up to and how conservative states are decrying and passing laws against the Patriot Act.
[01:55:15.859 --> 01:55:18.180]  Also, big news story out of the London Guardian.
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.041]  We're in British court.
[01:55:19.081 --> 01:55:21.902]  They admit they're torturing people now and that that's A-OK.
[01:55:22.342 --> 01:55:23.543]  Kind of a big deal, folks.
[01:55:25.017 --> 01:55:26.219]  That's coming up as well.
[01:55:27.621 --> 01:55:29.623]  Got news on record Ritalin use.
[01:55:30.565 --> 01:55:35.692]  They're now giving it in mass in the UK and the US to babies 15 months old or younger.
[01:55:35.732 --> 01:55:36.513]  I mean, think about that.
[01:55:36.913 --> 01:55:39.357]  A dangerous amphetamine, basically methamphetamine.
[01:55:40.859 --> 01:55:42.000]  To babies, people.
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:45.304]  If your kid's hyper and doesn't behave, just drug them so they grill in the corner.
[01:55:45.824 --> 01:55:48.868]  It's not that you're giving them Coca-Cola and Twinkies.
[01:55:49.008 --> 01:55:50.509]  That's not why they're bouncing off the walls.
[01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:53.552]  Here, give them some speed to burn their little brains out.
[01:55:53.913 --> 01:55:54.854]  Retard growth.
[01:55:54.974 --> 01:55:55.935]  Strength their brains.
[01:55:56.235 --> 01:55:57.817]  Cause heart palpitations.
[01:55:59.439 --> 01:56:00.860]  So just pure evil right in our face.
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:01.521]  That's coming up.
[01:56:02.634 --> 01:56:03.275]  It's amazing.
[01:56:03.435 --> 01:56:16.944]  More on the microbiologist, former head of Horton Down, one of the whistleblowers to the BBC and their writer, Mr. Gilligan, how Dr. Kelly supposedly committed suicide, but they say it was a grisly scene.
[01:56:17.344 --> 01:56:18.705]  Some new developments on that.
[01:56:18.785 --> 01:56:19.546]  That's coming up.
[01:56:21.187 --> 01:56:29.873]  And the FBI denies failing to spot September 11th pilot, but it comes out that report FBI knew 911 hijackers lived with them.
[01:56:32.708 --> 01:56:33.168]  Yeah, of course.
[01:56:33.188 --> 01:56:34.309]  They ran the whole operation.
[01:56:35.290 --> 01:56:39.974]  And continuing, we'll get into the new FBI report, which is basically a whitewash, but it's bad enough.
[01:56:40.734 --> 01:56:41.535]  Just incredible.
[01:56:43.296 --> 01:56:45.498]  Bunch of news on the mercenaries.
[01:56:45.858 --> 01:56:47.800]  This is out of the Scotsman.
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:49.461]  We also have one out of the London Independent.
[01:56:49.681 --> 01:56:53.204]  And another out of the New York Times.
[01:56:53.364 --> 01:56:53.564]  U.S.
[01:56:53.625 --> 01:56:55.226]  is creating an Iraqi militia to...
[01:56:56.272 --> 01:56:57.573]  Relieve GIs.
[01:56:57.673 --> 01:56:57.893]  U.S.
[01:56:57.933 --> 01:56:59.975]  plans to enlist Iraqis in operation.
[01:57:00.015 --> 01:57:01.756]  Civil force intended to quell resistance.
[01:57:02.276 --> 01:57:05.278]  And it's a bunch of murderers they're hiring literally out of the prisons.
[01:57:06.099 --> 01:57:08.641]  War incorporated on the march to relieve U.S.
[01:57:08.681 --> 01:57:10.482]  troops all over the world.
[01:57:10.542 --> 01:57:12.043]  It says they wear black uniforms.
[01:57:12.083 --> 01:57:13.944]  They work for DynCorp and others.
[01:57:13.964 --> 01:57:16.846]  We'll talk about the history of DynCorp.
[01:57:17.807 --> 01:57:20.889]  We'll be getting into all of that news.
[01:57:21.029 --> 01:57:25.212]  Also, construction of nuclear reactors in North Korea ongoing despite tension.
[01:57:26.670 --> 01:57:29.512]  Our government giving a nuclear reactor, showing how staged all this is.
[01:57:30.253 --> 01:57:32.915]  Lawsuit claims troopers have ticket quotas.
[01:57:32.975 --> 01:57:33.595]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:57:33.796 --> 01:57:35.157]  Ex-trooper, Trooper of the Year.
[01:57:35.177 --> 01:57:36.738]  Blew the whistle on this.
[01:57:37.458 --> 01:57:41.001]  Mistakes admitted in South Carolina mental jail stays.
[01:57:41.441 --> 01:57:44.584]  Turns out people stayed months who were completely innocent and had done nothing wrong.
[01:57:46.278 --> 01:57:47.599]  That's all coming up.
[01:57:47.779 --> 01:57:50.401]  Iraq weapons, now a secondary issue, the White House says.
[01:57:50.421 --> 01:57:51.262]  Don't worry about it.
[01:57:51.522 --> 01:57:52.622]  It was never about that.
[01:57:52.803 --> 01:57:54.143]  Funny, I thought it was all about that.
[01:57:54.744 --> 01:57:57.025]  They want you to engage in double-think and forget it.
[01:57:58.726 --> 01:57:59.247]  More U.S.
[01:57:59.307 --> 01:58:00.147]  soldiers being killed.
[01:58:00.207 --> 01:58:04.911]  Unfortunately, Cheney had Iraq in sight two years ago.
[01:58:05.031 --> 01:58:12.536]  More on the internal documents of his energy task force about how they'd soon be getting the Iraq oil before the enabling event of 9-1-1.
[01:58:12.576 --> 01:58:14.057]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:16.895 --> 01:58:20.519]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[01:58:20.679 --> 01:58:25.064]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:29.729]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[01:58:29.749 --> 01:58:32.873]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[01:58:33.153 --> 01:58:37.718]  It works for just pennies a day with 24 hours, 7 day a week continuous action.
[01:58:38.038 --> 01:58:41.941]  Made of the finest materials, it has a two-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[01:58:42.201 --> 01:58:44.582]  And the Aaronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[01:58:44.863 --> 01:58:48.765]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[01:58:48.985 --> 01:58:54.189]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds, and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[01:58:54.389 --> 01:58:57.331]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[01:58:57.491 --> 01:58:59.372]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[01:58:59.572 --> 01:59:02.234]  For more information about the Aaronizer, call toll-free.
[01:59:02.474 --> 01:59:04.155]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[01:59:04.395 --> 01:59:07.576]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[01:59:07.996 --> 01:59:09.976]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:59:09.996 --> 01:59:18.598]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:18.758 --> 01:59:23.179]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:23.339 --> 01:59:27.700]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:29.100]  The New World Order.
[01:59:30.896 --> 01:59:35.097]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:35.177 --> 01:59:42.100]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:44.261]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:44.541 --> 01:59:45.542]  Homeland Security.
[01:59:45.862 --> 01:59:55.066]  Executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:55.226 --> 02:00:00.608]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:01:15.849 --> 02:01:21.414]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:23.408 --> 02:01:28.190]  All right, we're back live, launching straight into the news, and coming up in the next segment, we'll go back into your calls.
[02:01:28.230 --> 02:01:30.050]  This is out of the Scotsman today.
[02:01:31.431 --> 02:01:34.332]  FBI denies failing to spot September 11th plot.
[02:01:34.392 --> 02:01:38.353]  Now, this has been out in the news for years, 22 months to be exact.
[02:01:38.753 --> 02:01:47.956]  The FBI missed a chance to uncover the September 11th plot by failing to discover the two men living with an FBI informant who were preparing to join the suicide hijackers.
[02:01:47.976 --> 02:01:49.897]  Congressional inquiry is expected to report
[02:01:51.030 --> 02:02:01.113]  The study due to be released this week also contains new evidence suggesting that a Saudi American government agent may have been a key associate of al-Qaeda attackers, according to Newsweek.
[02:02:01.193 --> 02:02:05.814]  Folks, the FBI paid for their houses, their cars, their credit cards.
[02:02:06.434 --> 02:02:08.614]  Okay, and a bunch of them have been found to still be alive.
[02:02:10.135 --> 02:02:15.176]  The study due to be released this week also contains new evidence suggesting that a Saudi American government agent
[02:02:17.176 --> 02:02:20.877]  May have been a key associate of al-Qaeda attackers, according to Newsweek.
[02:02:21.958 --> 02:02:30.080]  One congressman involved in the probe told the magazine that the findings were a scathing indictment of the FBI and an agency that doesn't have a clue about terrorism.
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:31.320]  Oh, it was an accident.
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:34.861]  Is that why your funding's all been increased?
[02:02:34.901 --> 02:02:42.964]  Is that why the people that blocked the investigation of this by good FBI low-level that were compartmentalized, is that why they got the biggest cast bonuses in FBI history?
[02:02:43.304 --> 02:02:44.124]  Is that why?
[02:02:44.144 --> 02:02:46.245]  You don't mention that, do you?
[02:02:47.938 --> 02:02:50.019]  We could talk about dead people here, folks.
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:53.721]  They're dead, those thousands that died.
[02:02:53.761 --> 02:02:54.722]  I don't think it's funny.
[02:02:54.942 --> 02:02:56.483]  And the globalists are going to carry more out.
[02:02:56.543 --> 02:02:58.324]  You watch unless we expose them on this.
[02:02:58.644 --> 02:02:59.805]  This is life or death.
[02:03:01.405 --> 02:03:08.589]  One congressman involved in the probe told the magazine that the findings were a scathing indictment of the FBI and the agency that doesn't have a clue about terrorism.
[02:03:08.609 --> 02:03:09.450]  The report states...
[02:03:10.974 --> 02:03:23.320]  The Bureau had evidence about a suspected Saudi secret agent who had extensive ties with hijackers Khalid al-Mahar and Nawaf al-Hazimi, but did not keep checks on him.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:33.944]  The report threatens to worsen the United States' relations with a long-time ally, Saudi Arabia, already dealt a massive blow by evidence that most of the September 11th hijackers were Saudi citizens.
[02:03:34.264 --> 02:03:35.885]  Yeah, and most of them are still alive.
[02:03:36.585 --> 02:03:37.786]  What does that mean, then?
[02:03:39.645 --> 02:03:41.887]  Well, you know how drones are piloted and controlled.
[02:03:42.007 --> 02:03:45.050]  You know, they've flown 747s from L.A.
[02:03:46.592 --> 02:03:50.375]  to the place with the kangaroos over there.
[02:03:52.197 --> 02:03:54.599]  So that's going on, flying them to Australia.
[02:03:54.619 --> 02:03:56.001]  I mean, it's remote control, folks.
[02:03:56.041 --> 02:03:57.302]  I don't want to get off all into that.
[02:03:57.362 --> 02:03:58.403]  I cover it in my films.
[02:03:59.614 --> 02:04:01.715]  Nine of the hijackers have been found alive.
[02:04:01.735 --> 02:04:06.498]  A bunch of the others have their houses, their cars, their credit cards paid for by the government.
[02:04:06.778 --> 02:04:08.820]  Public officials got told not to fly that day.
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.902]  The CIA put put options in against America and United days before.
[02:04:13.382 --> 02:04:16.064]  Bush had trips massing into Zikistan and Uzbekistan.
[02:04:17.585 --> 02:04:21.547]  Salman Rushdie got told not to fly that week to New York by the FAA for his safety.
[02:04:22.908 --> 02:04:26.510]  Mayor Willie Brown got a call from the FAA the night before, told not to fly to New York.
[02:04:27.330 --> 02:04:28.631]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:04:28.751 --> 02:04:32.193]  MSNBC reports Israel did tell its people to get out of the building.
[02:04:33.493 --> 02:04:34.414]  I got that in the films.
[02:04:34.434 --> 02:04:35.654]  That's mainstream news.
[02:04:36.915 --> 02:04:38.596]  On and on and on and on.
[02:04:38.816 --> 02:04:42.098]  And the neocons and the PNAC board.
[02:04:42.941 --> 02:04:59.272]  Policy board with Dick Cheney saying we need a big Pearl Harbor event to get our New World Order before 9-1-1, and his energy documents about how they were soon going to have Iraq's oil and have the pretext to get it before September 11th, two months before U.S.
[02:04:59.312 --> 02:05:00.252]  troops massing.
[02:05:02.173 --> 02:05:02.994]  Those on and on.
[02:05:03.074 --> 02:05:04.875]  I mean, I've had to make two films and write a book.
[02:05:04.915 --> 02:05:07.717]  I shouldn't even get into 9-1-1 without doing a whole show on it.
[02:05:07.757 --> 02:05:08.918]  We are tomorrow, by the way.
[02:05:10.692 --> 02:05:11.652]  With George Humphrey.
[02:05:11.672 --> 02:05:12.553]  You don't want to miss that.
[02:05:12.853 --> 02:05:14.393]  Okay, I'm going to get bogged down here.
[02:05:14.413 --> 02:05:14.953]  I've got to hurry.
[02:05:15.674 --> 02:05:16.814]  Bush approval rating at 59.
[02:05:17.634 --> 02:05:20.035]  Democrats give an edge on economy.
[02:05:20.535 --> 02:05:21.956]  Doesn't matter if you get the Democrats in there.
[02:05:21.996 --> 02:05:23.036]  They're all on the same team.
[02:05:23.736 --> 02:05:25.937]  Two different tires on the other side of this truck.
[02:05:26.857 --> 02:05:30.038]  The sluggish economy and the continuing daily threat of U.S.
[02:05:30.058 --> 02:05:33.820]  forces in Iraq have taken a toll on President Bush's public standing, according to the U.S.
[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:34.820]  Today Gallup poll.
[02:05:35.762 --> 02:05:39.104]  The President's approval rating fell 59, its lowest level since March.
[02:05:39.584 --> 02:05:42.185]  The poll of 1,003 adults over the weekend.
[02:05:42.265 --> 02:05:45.927]  And his overall approval on the economy is 45%.
[02:05:47.828 --> 02:05:49.648]  It's just dropping, dropping, dropping.
[02:05:49.688 --> 02:05:51.809]  Some of his other polls are in the low 40s.
[02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:55.231]  Lots of different poll numbers on different questions.
[02:05:55.931 --> 02:05:56.652]  The goes below 40!
[02:05:56.772 --> 02:05:59.233]  Look out!
[02:06:00.133 --> 02:06:04.115]  He'll need to do something, or that is the people he works for will need to do something to
[02:06:04.818 --> 02:06:07.741]  Get us all back in line, praising him as our savior.
[02:06:08.261 --> 02:06:14.466]  Some more rubble for him to stand up on top of with a bullhorn and tell us how much he loves America.
[02:06:14.826 --> 02:06:16.027]  We'll just give our rights up.
[02:06:16.067 --> 02:06:16.948]  He'll keep us safe.
[02:06:17.309 --> 02:06:18.510]  We just don't ask questions.
[02:06:18.810 --> 02:06:21.272]  What did Dick Cheney say on Meet the Press last year?
[02:06:21.312 --> 02:06:27.397]  He said, if you continue to frustrate us with 911 investigations, you're ensuring a larger attack.
[02:06:27.497 --> 02:06:30.119]  And then he smiled cryptically.
[02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:32.081]  You like being threatened, America?
[02:06:35.547 --> 02:06:36.508]  So it goes on and on.
[02:06:36.528 --> 02:06:39.670]  You can read the Newsweek whitewash that they call exclusive.
[02:06:39.690 --> 02:06:46.115]  We had David Shippers on two weeks after 9-1-1, telling you everything and more that's in these stories.
[02:06:47.115 --> 02:06:49.937]  By the way, part of that David Shippers interview is in The Road to Tyranny.
[02:06:51.779 --> 02:06:56.482]  Continuing, war incorporated on the march to relieve U.S.
[02:06:56.562 --> 02:07:00.184]  troops, the Scotland on Sunday newspaper.
[02:07:00.705 --> 02:07:02.086]  Now listen carefully to this.
[02:07:03.846 --> 02:07:14.412]  With their laser-targeted assault rifles, wraparound sunglasses, and black uniforms, the men guarding Afghan President Mohammed Karzai look like U.S.
[02:07:14.452 --> 02:07:15.652]  Special Forces.
[02:07:16.413 --> 02:07:20.055]  But in fact, they are American mercenaries working for private contractors.
[02:07:20.455 --> 02:07:29.760]  The Special Forces, who used to guard Karzai, flew home last autumn after the Bush administration decided to contract out the job of protecting the Afghan leader.
[02:07:30.762 --> 02:07:32.243]  A captain of these units is paid $300,000 a year.
[02:07:32.263 --> 02:07:36.425]  Commanders of overall operations countrywide are paid over a million dollars a year.
[02:08:00.794 --> 02:08:02.254]  And then they whine on the TV.
[02:08:02.414 --> 02:08:04.015]  Oh, send some money to the troops.
[02:08:04.055 --> 02:08:05.315]  They're on food stamps.
[02:08:06.275 --> 02:08:09.056]  Yeah, I am sad for the troops, but how about they stop all this?
[02:08:09.076 --> 02:08:12.377]  And it turns out globalists own these companies like DynCorp.
[02:08:12.857 --> 02:08:23.019]  Oh, by the way, these guys have gotten lots of work before, according to the BBC, loading the kidnapped women and children on jets to be flown to the Middle East and Asia.
[02:08:25.239 --> 02:08:26.180]  They got caught.
[02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:27.240]  This is what they do.
[02:08:28.263 --> 02:08:32.685]  Their presence is just one manifestation of dramatic trend towards privatization of war by the Pentagon.
[02:08:33.145 --> 02:08:35.706]  The use of private contractors is not new.
[02:08:36.167 --> 02:08:44.811]  What is unprecedented is that the Pentagon has pushed privatization further than ever, even to the extent of using private contractors for core military functions.
[02:08:46.551 --> 02:08:51.754]  Well, that's also so you can compartmentalize stuff so people in the military don't get a view of what's really happening.
[02:08:52.617 --> 02:09:10.813]  And they found that generals have even blown the whistle, special forces colonel in Afghanistan as well, when they weren't allowed to capture real al-Qaeda or forced to release them or fly them out to safety into Pakistan to start the next phase of the destabilization process between India and Pakistan.
[02:09:12.975 --> 02:09:19.021]  Black masks, black uniforms, and of course they're all former SEALs, Delta Force, and others.
[02:09:21.087 --> 02:09:21.629]  We're good to go.
[02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:32.391]  Shrunk by a third since the end of the Cold War.
[02:09:32.451 --> 02:09:34.673]  The private military industry has grown rapidly.
[02:09:34.713 --> 02:09:48.783]  It now compromises 1,000 companies, generating between $100 billion and $200 billion a year, according to Peter Singer, in a new book, Corporate Warriors, The Rise of Privatized Military Industry.
[02:09:49.104 --> 02:09:52.206]  And Bush has authorized these guys to operate domestically, by the way.
[02:09:53.427 --> 02:09:59.672]  So the guy that grabs the Patriot and throws him in the van to be taken off, never to be seen again, acts under national security umbrella
[02:10:00.802 --> 02:10:01.462]  With no record.
[02:10:02.683 --> 02:10:03.663]  Talk about the mafia.
[02:10:03.683 --> 02:10:04.163]  This is it.
[02:10:05.203 --> 02:10:08.684]  During the 91 Gulf War, let me go back.
[02:10:09.025 --> 02:10:12.346]  Singer said, this is a huge and growing industry that is increasingly active.
[02:10:12.606 --> 02:10:13.906]  A number of conflict zones.
[02:10:13.946 --> 02:10:18.868]  The state is usually thought of as having a monopoly on the use of force, but it isn't anymore.
[02:10:20.428 --> 02:10:21.908]  Oh, yeah.
[02:10:21.948 --> 02:10:23.289]  A $100 to $200 billion industry.
[02:10:23.329 --> 02:10:24.169]  Pretty big, huh?
[02:10:24.969 --> 02:10:26.850]  That's where the black masks come in.
[02:10:28.202 --> 02:10:29.683]  Popularized by Hollywood.
[02:10:29.703 --> 02:10:32.965]  Most of your cops now wear combat boots and black uniforms.
[02:10:34.126 --> 02:10:35.286]  They'll have the balaclava.
[02:10:35.306 --> 02:10:36.547]  That's the black mask on the back.
[02:10:36.947 --> 02:10:37.748]  No badge numbers.
[02:10:38.168 --> 02:10:39.889]  That's so these guys can operate.
[02:10:39.909 --> 02:10:41.890]  We've been saying this for eight years since I've been on the air.
[02:10:43.711 --> 02:10:45.172]  And we have this from internal sources.
[02:10:45.212 --> 02:10:47.053]  Well, now you can pick up the newspaper and read about it.
[02:10:49.466 --> 02:10:50.266]  And that's bad enough.
[02:10:50.286 --> 02:10:51.727]  We got Mossad here domestically.
[02:10:51.827 --> 02:10:53.968]  UPI reported allowed to, quote, kill Americans.
[02:10:54.348 --> 02:10:56.869]  No arrest, no jury, no judge, no indictment.
[02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:58.090]  You're just dead.
[02:10:58.110 --> 02:11:02.212]  Oh yeah, Ashcroft, you're not taking any of our rights.
[02:11:02.292 --> 02:11:03.552]  No, no.
[02:11:03.572 --> 02:11:08.314]  A $100-$200 billion industry of mercenaries.
[02:11:08.574 --> 02:11:15.337]  And the Washington Times reported last year convicted felons, if they're illegal aliens, get to come back and become members of the military.
[02:11:15.777 --> 02:11:17.278]  Washington Times reported
[02:11:17.851 --> 02:11:21.555]  It listed people convicted of arson, rape, armed robbery.
[02:11:23.577 --> 02:11:25.198]  That's your new enforcers, folks.
[02:11:28.982 --> 02:11:29.783]  And it goes on.
[02:11:30.744 --> 02:11:34.668]  During the 91 Gulf War, there was one private contractor for every 50 soldiers.
[02:11:35.088 --> 02:11:37.470]  In Iraq, the war involved one private contractor for every 10.
[02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:39.100]  Oh, okay.
[02:12:03.345 --> 02:12:11.607]  But the decision has been criticized by two congressmen, Henry Hyde, who is chairman of the House History Committee, and Tom Lantos, the most senior Democrat.
[02:12:13.487 --> 02:12:20.389]  And it's going on here domestically, en masse, and DynCorp, as I said earlier, is the big one.
[02:12:21.989 --> 02:12:26.610]  And it just so happens they've been caught in the Balkans running 200,000 kidnapped women and children.
[02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:27.590]  That's BBC, folks.
[02:12:27.610 --> 02:12:28.591]  We're here on the air saying it.
[02:12:29.171 --> 02:12:30.031]  It's in the newspapers.
[02:12:30.811 --> 02:12:31.812]  And it's in the back of the paper.
[02:12:31.852 --> 02:12:33.252]  The average American has no idea.
[02:12:34.373 --> 02:12:35.973]  You tell them this, they roll their eyes at you.
[02:12:37.754 --> 02:12:39.715]  And they're going to operate domestically.
[02:12:39.755 --> 02:12:41.776]  I have Ridge on tape on C-SPAN saying it.
[02:12:44.617 --> 02:12:45.918]  So that's the new America, folks.
[02:12:45.998 --> 02:12:47.038]  All compartmentalized.
[02:12:47.319 --> 02:12:50.400]  And now you're going to have the multi-trillion dollar Defense Department.
[02:12:52.009 --> 02:12:54.370]  It's already at $100 to $200 billion being put into this.
[02:12:54.711 --> 02:12:56.512]  Now even more shifting.
[02:12:56.532 --> 02:12:58.653]  See, the privatization isn't privatizing at all.
[02:12:59.093 --> 02:13:04.296]  It's the private globalists transferring government control to private industries who have total anonymity.
[02:13:05.216 --> 02:13:06.677]  You're not going to get their corporate documents.
[02:13:07.538 --> 02:13:13.341]  You start to figure out the mass wholesale wickedness we're facing.
[02:13:15.194 --> 02:13:19.077]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:13:19.317 --> 02:13:24.762]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:13:25.042 --> 02:13:35.390]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:13:35.570 --> 02:13:39.914]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:13:40.094 --> 02:13:48.439]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:13:48.719 --> 02:13:55.102]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:13:55.202 --> 02:13:59.685]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:13:59.905 --> 02:14:04.107]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:14:04.487 --> 02:14:08.790]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:14:09.110 --> 02:14:09.711]  We're good to go.
[02:14:31.633 --> 02:14:32.274]  We're good to go.
[02:14:52.054 --> 02:14:52.695]  We're good to go.
[02:14:52.735 --> 02:14:53.355]  We're good to go.
[02:15:14.008 --> 02:15:17.811]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[02:15:18.112 --> 02:15:25.057]  Use a Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and a Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.
[02:15:25.358 --> 02:15:26.879]  Take control of your own destiny.
[02:15:27.039 --> 02:15:31.503]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[02:15:31.663 --> 02:15:32.964]  This is more than a handbook.
[02:15:33.144 --> 02:15:36.447]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[02:15:36.847 --> 02:15:37.548]  Here's the deal.
[02:15:37.768 --> 02:15:49.038]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend, and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[02:15:49.279 --> 02:15:55.204]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918 and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[02:15:56.645 --> 02:15:56.985]  We're good to go.
[02:16:17.421 --> 02:16:17.861]  We're good to go.
[02:16:47.381 --> 02:16:53.143]  That's 877-518-5888 or visit www.gtitelcom.com for more information and put some predictability into your business.
[02:17:15.183 --> 02:17:17.925]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:17:17.945 --> 02:17:28.051]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:32.913 --> 02:17:37.036]  I could talk for hours, for hours, about why it's bad to have a mercenary army.
[02:17:37.116 --> 02:17:42.419]  I mean, they'll owe allegiance to the private contractors that just so happen to be connected to Dick Cheney and Bush and
[02:17:43.543 --> 02:17:44.884]  The Democrats as well.
[02:17:46.344 --> 02:17:48.765]  The military-industrial complex is privately owned.
[02:17:48.825 --> 02:17:49.866]  They make all the profits.
[02:17:49.906 --> 02:17:50.906]  That's not enough now.
[02:17:51.286 --> 02:17:52.747]  They're going to own the armies.
[02:17:53.427 --> 02:17:54.408]  Large armies.
[02:17:55.788 --> 02:17:59.930]  In fact, some estimates are 15% of the troops in Afghanistan are private.
[02:18:00.630 --> 02:18:02.331]  And the Scotsman on Sunday article...
[02:18:03.428 --> 02:18:05.770]  Says, meanwhile, when a plane carrying U.S.
[02:18:05.810 --> 02:18:17.797]  missionaries was shot down by a Peruvian military aircraft in Peru, it emerged the attack was an accidental one carried out after a mercenary's plane was mistakenly identified by a U.S.
[02:18:17.817 --> 02:18:22.820]  surveillance aircraft flown by private contractors hired by America for its own war against drugs.
[02:18:22.981 --> 02:18:28.184]  We're hiring a private army, says Janice Sulzkowski, a Democratic congresswoman who has sponsored...
[02:18:28.934 --> 02:18:32.675]  Two failed bills that try to curb the role of commercial contractors in military roles.
[02:18:32.715 --> 02:18:36.956]  We are engaging in a secret war, and American people need to be told about it and why.
[02:18:38.596 --> 02:18:39.496]  Yeah, well, that's true.
[02:18:39.597 --> 02:18:45.278]  I mean, folks, a free society, you know, the first thing Caesar does is he hires his own private internal guard.
[02:18:45.298 --> 02:18:46.078]  Hitler did it.
[02:18:46.698 --> 02:18:47.518]  They're doing it now.
[02:18:47.598 --> 02:18:48.959]  They even wore the black uniforms.
[02:18:50.805 --> 02:18:58.627]  With laser-targeting assault rifles, wraparound sunglasses, and black uniforms, the men guarding Afghan President Mohammed Karzai look like U.S.
[02:18:58.647 --> 02:18:59.548]  Special Forces.
[02:19:01.468 --> 02:19:06.570]  And it says that at Camp Arjafjan, how do we pronounce it, the giant U.S.
[02:19:06.590 --> 02:19:17.213]  military base south of Kuwait City, the armed figures guarding the gates are civilian employees of Combat Support Associates, provides the Army with security, logistics, live fire training, and maintenance.
[02:19:17.933 --> 02:19:19.854]  But again, these aren't the guys getting killed.
[02:19:20.903 --> 02:19:22.204]  You're good to go.
[02:19:39.304 --> 02:19:40.625]  But that's okay.
[02:19:40.845 --> 02:19:46.189]  He comes back, his kids are autistic from the shots, and he's got DU all in him, and he's got lung cancer.
[02:19:46.209 --> 02:19:50.773]  But that's okay, because Don Corr and others, they're running things.
[02:19:51.073 --> 02:19:59.800]  And all they do is carry out the security and other things, and then our troops sit out there and get shot for the private bankers.
[02:20:01.421 --> 02:20:02.682]  All right, we're about to go to your calls.
[02:20:02.702 --> 02:20:06.826]  We'll go to Sherry Ann and then...
[02:20:08.132 --> 02:20:23.022]  Steve and then Dan and Barney and others, but this dovetails nicely with the private corporations meeting with about two months before 9-1-1 with the Chinese Energy Commission plotting what they would do with Iraq's oil after they got it.
[02:20:23.322 --> 02:20:24.063]  Oh, before 9-1-1.
[02:20:24.423 --> 02:20:25.063]  Hmm, I see.
[02:20:25.804 --> 02:20:27.045]  That's their own documents.
[02:20:27.065 --> 02:20:28.686]  That's judicial watch, folks.
[02:20:29.306 --> 02:20:31.027]  Oh, but you're liberal if you criticize them.
[02:20:31.087 --> 02:20:31.528]  Oh, I see.
[02:20:32.448 --> 02:20:34.229]  Let's go ahead and go to...
[02:20:36.585 --> 02:20:37.906]  Sherry Ann or Sarah Ann?
[02:20:38.366 --> 02:20:38.887]  Sherry Ann.
[02:20:39.227 --> 02:20:40.127]  Welcome to the Airwaves.
[02:20:40.488 --> 02:20:41.769]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:20:42.349 --> 02:20:47.052]  I'm a bit angry this morning listening to your caller, Daniel, I believe his name was.
[02:20:48.353 --> 02:21:04.424]  He called in saying that there is nothing we could do, and I don't know if that was his name, but I wanted to give him a message, and that denial is the highest form of mental illness, and it's people like him that are taking down our republic.
[02:21:05.069 --> 02:21:11.494]  And it makes me very angry that he has the nerve to call in and speak with such ignorance.
[02:21:12.014 --> 02:21:15.737]  Well, I don't want to go that far with him, but he's disillusioned.
[02:21:15.757 --> 02:21:17.078]  We've got to get his morale up.
[02:21:17.158 --> 02:21:18.719]  But, yes, we are on the march.
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:22.542]  A lot of good things are happening, but Peter Jennings isn't going to tell us that.
[02:21:22.963 --> 02:21:23.583]  No, he's not.
[02:21:24.043 --> 02:21:32.810]  I would like to also tell Daniel that I'm a registered nurse, and I have lost many jobs because of my stand against vaccinations.
[02:21:33.211 --> 02:21:35.452]  Against medications and just protocol.
[02:21:36.073 --> 02:21:39.495]  And he needs to gain some strength.
[02:21:39.955 --> 02:21:41.576]  So you put yourself on the line.
[02:21:41.596 --> 02:21:42.276]  Absolutely.
[02:21:42.296 --> 02:21:43.137]  That's great.
[02:21:43.177 --> 02:21:44.598]  That's the truth, Alex.
[02:21:44.678 --> 02:21:45.978]  I'm going to follow the truth.
[02:21:46.519 --> 02:21:48.160]  I'm going to follow what's true to my heart.
[02:21:48.660 --> 02:21:50.901]  And when you do that, you can't go wrong.
[02:21:51.241 --> 02:21:52.082]  You will always win.
[02:21:52.122 --> 02:21:53.263]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[02:21:53.383 --> 02:21:55.364]  You're truly alive, too.
[02:21:55.904 --> 02:21:56.444]  Exactly.
[02:21:57.765 --> 02:22:00.947]  You know, that's what this man needs to do is start following the truth.
[02:22:01.388 --> 02:22:03.028]  I can't believe he is so informed.
[02:22:03.408 --> 02:22:05.229]  He suggests that he is very informed.
[02:22:05.269 --> 02:22:08.970]  He watches or listens to your show, but he does absolutely nothing about it.
[02:22:09.390 --> 02:22:17.491]  If I had his money, which he proclaims he has, I would be taking all my money and I would be handing out your videos at a mall.
[02:22:17.831 --> 02:22:21.392]  Right now, I've probably handed about 50 out of your videos.
[02:22:21.412 --> 02:22:22.352]  Well, thank you.
[02:22:22.432 --> 02:22:23.332]  Wow, that's great.
[02:22:24.013 --> 02:22:26.373]  And got a couple of your t-shirts, and I just...
[02:22:26.772 --> 02:22:30.255]  You know, this guy needs to buy a t-shirt, buy some videos, do something.
[02:22:30.635 --> 02:22:31.235]  Well, I know this.
[02:22:31.316 --> 02:22:37.280]  If he wears one of my gun control shirts against gun control, he will meet like-minded people wearing it.
[02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:37.901]  Absolutely.
[02:22:37.961 --> 02:22:38.861]  Has that happened to you?
[02:22:39.442 --> 02:22:39.682]  Yes.
[02:22:40.583 --> 02:22:41.143]  It's great.
[02:22:41.503 --> 02:22:42.124]  Well, that's great.
[02:22:42.724 --> 02:22:44.045]  Anything else you'd like to add or are you done?
[02:22:44.065 --> 02:22:46.047]  No, I just wanted to say thank you very much for everything, Alex.
[02:22:46.087 --> 02:22:46.928]  You're doing awesome.
[02:22:47.248 --> 02:22:47.848]  Well, thank you.
[02:22:47.888 --> 02:22:48.449]  God bless you.
[02:22:49.964 --> 02:22:50.725]  Wonderful lady.
[02:22:50.905 --> 02:22:51.425]  All right.
[02:22:52.326 --> 02:22:53.827]  Look, people's morale gets down, though.
[02:22:53.847 --> 02:22:58.310]  I don't want to knock the caller earlier, but I understand her frustration at him.
[02:22:58.990 --> 02:23:00.371]  But, hey, it's a war.
[02:23:00.431 --> 02:23:01.873]  Some people are going to have low morale.
[02:23:02.053 --> 02:23:03.273]  I'm not going to have low morale.
[02:23:05.395 --> 02:23:06.336]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.796 --> 02:23:08.457]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.318 --> 02:23:12.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.447 --> 02:23:19.349]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:23:19.569 --> 02:23:25.012]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:23:25.292 --> 02:23:32.596]  Ideal for 6, 44, 48 to learn more or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[02:23:32.897 --> 02:23:35.278]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[02:23:41.022 --> 02:23:42.924]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:43.404 --> 02:23:46.227]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:49.010 --> 02:23:52.874]  Now, I just talked about how they've got the mercenaries in mass.
[02:23:53.094 --> 02:23:54.675]  $100 to $200 billion a year.
[02:23:54.936 --> 02:23:57.258]  They wear black uniforms, ski masks, you name it.
[02:23:58.169 --> 02:24:04.691]  Dying Corps has been caught with these operations, kidnapping 200,000 women and children, transporting them out to different points around the world.
[02:24:05.231 --> 02:24:06.311]  That's BBC.
[02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:08.372]  That's AP, folks.
[02:24:08.992 --> 02:24:17.274]  And now they're going to be running your life here domestically, taking over more and more of the military, owing their allegiance to private corporations that are chaired by former CIA directors and others.
[02:24:18.886 --> 02:24:28.132]  And on top of it, new headline, Pentagon seeking private security firm to police Iraq, but large parts of Iraq still gripped by lawlessness and guerrilla warfare.
[02:24:28.532 --> 02:24:37.839]  The Pentagon is planning to hire a private security firm to arm and train thousands of former Iraqi soldiers to guard government buildings, pipelines, and other important installations.
[02:24:38.419 --> 02:24:39.620]  Now, they're doing a lot more than that.
[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:47.525]  The Pentagon has been in talks with the private security firm Kroll, who trained the former soldiers to take over duties at...
[02:24:49.219 --> 02:24:52.781]  At spots now guarded by U.S.
[02:24:52.861 --> 02:24:58.303]  soldiers, the guards would carry small arms and were responsible for security of up to 2,000 sites.
[02:24:58.343 --> 02:25:00.464]  So lots of news on that.
[02:25:00.525 --> 02:25:01.045]  The U.S.
[02:25:01.085 --> 02:25:04.426]  is creating an Iraq militia to relieve G.I.s.
[02:25:04.446 --> 02:25:14.811]  Well, they already hired the former secret police captain from Iran, who then, after the Shah fell, went to Jordan, where he got convicted for stealing $300 million.
[02:25:16.935 --> 02:25:21.419]  An embezzlement scam, and now he's the head guy in Iraq, and he's got all his former people.
[02:25:21.859 --> 02:25:26.703]  There's, according to the press reports, raping, killing, assassinating, robbing street vendors.
[02:25:27.363 --> 02:25:30.085]  I hear the neocons talking about the freedom of the Iraqi people.
[02:25:30.446 --> 02:25:42.255]  There's an AP article two weeks ago with the people with the bags over their heads being loaded on the backs of army trucks taken to these re-education centers for, quote, selling things without a license on the streets, beer and stuff like that.
[02:25:43.777 --> 02:25:48.642]  It's a giant business with 200, excuse me, 20 million slaves.
[02:25:50.123 --> 02:25:52.065]  Thinking of America with 200 million slaves.
[02:25:52.425 --> 02:25:54.727]  Actually, 300 million slaves is closer to it.
[02:25:56.308 --> 02:25:57.490]  Oh, man, we're in deep trouble.
[02:25:58.190 --> 02:25:59.611]  Let's go back to the calls.
[02:25:59.692 --> 02:26:02.474]  Let's talk to Steve in Ohio.
[02:26:02.514 --> 02:26:03.275]  Steve, you're on the air.
[02:26:03.315 --> 02:26:03.715]  Go ahead.
[02:26:03.735 --> 02:26:05.557]  I think you hit me, Alex.
[02:26:06.602 --> 02:26:07.503]  Okay.
[02:26:07.903 --> 02:26:08.844]  This is Dan from Illinois.
[02:26:09.064 --> 02:26:10.326]  Okay, Dan in Illinois.
[02:26:10.346 --> 02:26:10.766]  Go ahead.
[02:26:11.066 --> 02:26:15.270]  Yeah, I mean, that Rumsfeld, I swear, it's hard to be more wicked than him, don't you think?
[02:26:15.951 --> 02:26:19.915]  Well, he is a globalist after their father's own heart.
[02:26:20.255 --> 02:26:24.259]  I mean, seriously, if death had a face, I think that would be his.
[02:26:25.340 --> 02:26:26.681]  When I look at him, that's all I see.
[02:26:26.901 --> 02:26:27.522]  I mean, it's just...
[02:26:29.548 --> 02:26:33.809]  He does look Nosferatu, vampirish.
[02:26:34.089 --> 02:26:35.510]  I mean, it's serious.
[02:26:35.930 --> 02:26:37.790]  It's a very, very evil-looking person.
[02:26:37.810 --> 02:26:39.190]  Vampirish, I think is the word.
[02:26:40.211 --> 02:26:51.694]  But as far as that caller from Florida is concerned, Alex, every day, somebody who thought they were immune to what the government could do to them is being affected.
[02:26:52.974 --> 02:26:57.155]  And since that's happening, then your message is going to hit these people somewhere along the line.
[02:26:57.677 --> 02:27:06.481]  They're going to find the people who have your message to explain why they're getting hit and what they've been in denial about and why they were not exempt ever.
[02:27:07.061 --> 02:27:10.462]  But a lot of people think they're exempt of what's going on by just playing along.
[02:27:12.683 --> 02:27:14.144]  Well, they're not exempt, my friend.
[02:27:14.164 --> 02:27:15.605]  No, but I think they are.
[02:27:17.685 --> 02:27:19.126]  I think they're part of the establishment.
[02:27:19.146 --> 02:27:19.726]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:19.786 --> 02:27:20.246]  Good point.
[02:27:20.927 --> 02:27:22.527]  Now let's try to go to Steve in Ohio.
[02:27:22.567 --> 02:27:23.388]  Steve, you're on the air.
[02:27:23.428 --> 02:27:23.768]  Go ahead.
[02:27:24.775 --> 02:27:25.575]  Hello, Alex?
[02:27:25.815 --> 02:27:26.195]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:26.215 --> 02:27:27.056]  Good afternoon.
[02:27:27.596 --> 02:27:33.978]  I'm calling with something off-topic, and I'm going to speak to one of your advertisers, the British Burke Field Filters.
[02:27:34.358 --> 02:27:34.678]  Yes.
[02:27:35.078 --> 02:27:42.921]  Yeah, and I've heard you mention before that folks buying a bottle of water are sometimes buying bottled water that may be six months or a year, even two years old.
[02:27:43.881 --> 02:27:52.824]  If folks will look at the bottom of their bottled water bottle, there's a small triangular-shaped emblem on the bottom, and normally those are...
[02:27:54.554 --> 02:27:56.074]  We're good to go.
[02:28:20.385 --> 02:28:23.207]  Oh, cleaning chemicals and stuff like that are all in plastic jugs.
[02:28:23.227 --> 02:28:24.909]  They're also in ones and twos.
[02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:28.451]  And the chemicals are leaching out of those jugs.
[02:28:28.471 --> 02:28:40.280]  If you have a pallet of, say, a bottle of drinking water sitting next to a pallet of chlorine bleach or... Well, that's why when you walk by a pallet of stuff, it reeks because they do leak.
[02:28:40.841 --> 02:28:41.121]  Right.
[02:28:41.281 --> 02:28:47.246]  And so these chemicals are leaching out of one jug into the drinking water pallet and the next one...
[02:28:47.972 --> 02:28:48.592]  We're good to go.
[02:29:09.321 --> 02:29:11.484]  And then still keep it away from other chemicals.
[02:29:11.524 --> 02:29:16.410]  That's all I had is just... So the little plastic triangle at the bottom is a rating of the plastic.
[02:29:16.470 --> 02:29:16.671]  Right.
[02:29:16.691 --> 02:29:18.053]  The lower the number, the worse it is.
[02:29:18.073 --> 02:29:19.134]  Okay.
[02:29:19.234 --> 02:29:20.836]  The lowest being a one.
[02:29:20.856 --> 02:29:24.741]  And most of your soft drinks... I knew it was a rating of the type of plastic.
[02:29:25.911 --> 02:29:29.213]  And so you're saying it's a rating system of how permeable it is?
[02:29:29.233 --> 02:29:29.653]  Sure.
[02:29:29.693 --> 02:29:30.654]  The lower the number, the worse.
[02:29:30.674 --> 02:29:35.516]  Well, the articles we read, I mean, the Dannon up in New York a few years ago killed people.
[02:29:36.517 --> 02:29:38.178]  The stuff that was in the water was so bad.
[02:29:38.198 --> 02:29:38.578]  Sure.
[02:29:38.678 --> 02:29:43.540]  Most of these bottled waters have bacteria and everything else in them, and they're kind of a joke, you know, really.
[02:29:44.841 --> 02:29:47.122]  And so that's why I was saying, go with the British Berkey.
[02:29:47.383 --> 02:29:48.463]  It's a high-quality filter.
[02:29:48.603 --> 02:29:55.848]  I owned these before it was a sponsor, folks, and now you just buy them from the national source and save a lot of money, Jim Shepard, and support this show.
[02:29:55.868 --> 02:29:57.308]  Right, and I knew that.
[02:29:57.368 --> 02:30:01.131]  I tried to get in the last time Jim was on the air, but your lines are busy.
[02:30:01.471 --> 02:30:03.352]  I'll hop off here because I know you need to get back to the news.
[02:30:03.392 --> 02:30:04.152]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:30:04.313 --> 02:30:05.193]  Well, that's important.
[02:30:05.273 --> 02:30:07.474]  Water, thank you, sir, Steve.
[02:30:07.975 --> 02:30:11.237]  Water is 70% of the body, and it's a big deal.
[02:30:12.899 --> 02:30:13.980]  Do the taste test.
[02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:15.702]  Drink water out of a bottle.
[02:30:15.802 --> 02:30:16.943]  Drink water out of a tap.
[02:30:17.303 --> 02:30:20.106]  And then taste water out of a Big Berkey.
[02:30:21.907 --> 02:30:25.290]  And you don't taste anything when it's out of a Big Berkey unless it's cold.
[02:30:25.330 --> 02:30:26.431]  You know, how kind of is that cold?
[02:30:27.092 --> 02:30:31.336]  Cold isn't supposed to have a taste, but it kind of does have that crispness feeling.
[02:30:31.876 --> 02:30:32.637]  But do it.
[02:30:32.717 --> 02:30:39.123]  I mean, in the past, I remember six, seven, eight, nine years ago before I knew how deadly fluoride was, I would drink a big glass of water.
[02:30:39.918 --> 02:30:40.878]  After brushing my teeth.
[02:30:41.379 --> 02:30:41.819]  Or before.
[02:30:41.899 --> 02:30:45.040]  And I remember I'd always have a stomachache just for a few minutes until I ate something.
[02:30:45.460 --> 02:30:56.524]  Well, now I can go to the refrigerator, pull out a jug that I've put Big Berkey water in, ice cold, delicious, make ice cubes with Big Berkey water.
[02:30:57.144 --> 02:31:03.326]  And then when you put them in your clear drinking glass, there won't be those weird white flakes at the bottom.
[02:31:03.366 --> 02:31:04.547]  And that's all the chemicals.
[02:31:05.473 --> 02:31:08.896]  Unless you've got really old plastic... really old plastic trays...
[02:31:26.923 --> 02:31:30.667]  I know a lot of you don't use trays anymore, but those break down too.
[02:31:30.687 --> 02:31:32.149]  But it's an important issue.
[02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:37.335]  And by the way, if you want to call and find out about the Big Berkey products they have to offer, it's 888-803-4438.
[02:31:37.355 --> 02:31:37.395]  888-803-4438.
[02:31:37.415 --> 02:31:40.058]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you to get the discounts.
[02:31:48.908 --> 02:31:52.469]  Because the prices you get when you mention my name are much lower than the ads you hear on this network.
[02:31:52.489 --> 02:31:53.549]  I'm sure you've already noticed that.
[02:31:54.349 --> 02:31:57.310]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:31:57.330 --> 02:31:59.450]  I'm going to get back into some more news.
[02:32:00.410 --> 02:32:03.671]  Let's talk to Barney in Maryland.
[02:32:03.731 --> 02:32:04.831]  Barney, thanks for holding.
[02:32:04.871 --> 02:32:05.571]  You're on the air.
[02:32:05.611 --> 02:32:06.091]  Go ahead.
[02:32:06.111 --> 02:32:07.311]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:32:07.491 --> 02:32:08.132]  Good, my friend.
[02:32:08.152 --> 02:32:09.312]  I got two points.
[02:32:09.792 --> 02:32:15.633]  First, what the establishment is doing to our military forces in Iraq is extremely cruel.
[02:32:16.113 --> 02:32:18.415]  Yeah, they're huffing to put a uranium.
[02:32:18.735 --> 02:32:20.876]  They were hit with Cern and VX in the first Gulf War.
[02:32:20.896 --> 02:32:24.439]  Admitted fact, giving them deadly anthrax and smallpox shots, killing them.
[02:32:24.459 --> 02:32:25.199]  That's now admitted.
[02:32:25.780 --> 02:32:28.621]  And they're living on welfare, unless you're a sergeant or above.
[02:32:29.462 --> 02:32:30.182]  But don't worry.
[02:32:30.623 --> 02:32:33.985]  The Merc people, the mercenaries, get $200,000 a year starting.
[02:32:36.397 --> 02:32:40.940]  Well, we should do everything we can to bring those troops home and send the mercenaries over there.
[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:44.242]  I was about to say, let's see how the mercenaries do without our boys.
[02:32:45.783 --> 02:32:51.167]  My other point was, yesterday you were talking about the voter fraud and the legal woman voters.
[02:32:52.168 --> 02:33:02.835]  And back when Spear Agnew was a Baltimore County executive around 1970, an urban renewal bill was passed that took some of our property rights away.
[02:33:03.795 --> 02:33:06.097]  And we petitioned a bill to referendum.
[02:33:06.884 --> 02:33:22.473]  And the supervisors of elections verified our signatures, and then the League of Women Voters somehow got access to the petitions, and they went over them, and they criticized some of the name-spelling.
[02:33:22.513 --> 02:33:24.815]  Yeah, they're the League of Stealing Elections.
[02:33:25.755 --> 02:33:30.438]  They were caught on video 12 years ago in Florida falsifying things.
[02:33:30.558 --> 02:33:32.439]  And you notice the congressman...
[02:33:33.644 --> 02:33:47.376]  Rush Holt has a bill to where the new electronic machines will have a paper ballot that is with them, and they're lobbying to stop that and for there to be any record, and they want them to be remotely accessed by wireless Internet.
[02:33:47.436 --> 02:33:49.098]  That's your League of Stealing Elections.
[02:33:49.158 --> 02:33:50.139]  I mean, League of Women Voters.
[02:33:50.479 --> 02:33:51.620]  That's right.
[02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:56.344]  And they went over, they criticized the names on the petitions.
[02:33:56.384 --> 02:33:58.066]  This is after they had been verified.
[02:33:58.718 --> 02:34:07.623]  And then we had to go over the entire stack of petitions, and then they came back and criticized the addresses, and we had to go over them again.
[02:34:07.763 --> 02:34:15.968]  And finally, one of our group contacted a woman lawyer, and we went to court and lost, or had a hearing on it.
[02:34:16.148 --> 02:34:17.329]  Well, let me give you an example.
[02:34:18.209 --> 02:34:21.931]  In California, they have double the signatures over double.
[02:34:23.232 --> 02:34:27.755]  The signatures needed to start a recall referendum of criminal Davis.
[02:34:29.469 --> 02:34:37.852]  Now, they have come out, and the government, Davis, is suing to have them all thrown out.
[02:34:37.932 --> 02:34:48.296]  Now, when the voters passed a law, the proposition to not give all the welfare to illegal aliens, to felons, he went in, he didn't say it was a bad vote.
[02:34:49.477 --> 02:34:51.437]  He went in and just said, I am disregarding it.
[02:34:51.497 --> 02:34:52.698]  The guy is a dictator.
[02:34:53.604 --> 02:34:57.746]  And I told people, you don't just get rid of a gun-grabbing, open-border criminal.
[02:34:57.766 --> 02:34:58.527]  And why is he a criminal?
[02:34:58.867 --> 02:35:03.189]  He got caught, and he got money for this, according to the Sacramento Bee, never made national news.
[02:35:04.630 --> 02:35:08.852]  You know, the neocons act like he was in a fight with Bush and the Energy Commission.
[02:35:09.312 --> 02:35:10.453]  And, Shaney, that's not true.
[02:35:11.854 --> 02:35:15.556]  He got caught, Barney Davis, buying a megawatt for $147.
[02:35:18.559 --> 02:35:27.968]  From Enron and others and selling it back for a dollar over and over again, thousands, millions of times, thousands of times a day, tens of thousands of times a day.
[02:35:27.988 --> 02:35:31.572]  I mean, think of that bid rigging, that scam.
[02:35:32.541 --> 02:35:34.082]  So the energy never even left.
[02:35:34.162 --> 02:35:38.965]  Just going in circles and then running up, you know, these billion-dollar, ten-billion-dollar bills.
[02:35:39.545 --> 02:35:41.166]  It was like $12 billion by the end of it.
[02:35:41.666 --> 02:35:43.307]  California can call in and refresh my memory.
[02:35:43.327 --> 02:35:44.868]  I think it was like $12 billion by the end of it.
[02:35:45.228 --> 02:35:48.170]  You know, the special bonds, putting you in debt, raising taxes.
[02:35:48.450 --> 02:35:49.371]  And it was all a scam.
[02:35:49.531 --> 02:35:51.232]  The guy should be in leg irons.
[02:35:51.832 --> 02:35:55.214]  It looks like they need the tar and feather crew out there again.
[02:35:55.855 --> 02:35:56.155]  No.
[02:35:56.615 --> 02:35:58.476]  Government is holy and can do no wrong.
[02:35:58.516 --> 02:35:59.056]  How dare you?
[02:35:59.177 --> 02:35:59.757]  And I would add...
[02:36:00.784 --> 02:36:09.811]  The former state attorney general, Morales, just went to prison for four years, and I said day one, I got criticized, I said, he is a criminal!
[02:36:10.331 --> 02:36:17.476]  He owns part of the law firm that got hundreds of millions, excuse me, billions of dollars, I forget, how many billion was it?
[02:36:17.496 --> 02:36:19.117]  It was some ridiculous amount.
[02:36:20.218 --> 02:36:23.781]  He gets the money from the ruling, I mean, come on, folks!
[02:36:25.011 --> 02:36:42.683]  Well, you know what you're going to have to do, Alex, is warn that lady you had on yesterday, I think her name was Beth, and tell her about what happened to the Collier brothers and Jack Ruby and some of our CIA agents that used up their usefulness and put her on guard.
[02:36:43.284 --> 02:36:45.225]  They all came down with cancer, you remember?
[02:36:46.166 --> 02:36:46.806]  Absolutely.
[02:36:47.787 --> 02:36:50.188]  I think they can eject it at will.
[02:36:50.989 --> 02:36:51.750]  Okay, I thank you.
[02:36:51.930 --> 02:36:52.530]  Well, Barney,
[02:36:54.795 --> 02:36:55.295]  You still there?
[02:36:56.155 --> 02:36:56.776]  Barney's gone.
[02:36:57.076 --> 02:37:01.117]  Barney, they have hundreds of viruses that produce cancer within weeks.
[02:37:01.137 --> 02:37:05.379]  I mean, they got naturally occurring cancer viruses.
[02:37:06.019 --> 02:37:13.362]  They just so happened that made it into the polio shot and then other more modern shots and cancer's way up with those new types we're getting to enjoy.
[02:37:13.762 --> 02:37:16.383]  So take your vaccines!
[02:37:17.063 --> 02:37:19.624]  The government loves you!
[02:37:23.050 --> 02:37:23.810]  And that's the thing.
[02:37:23.850 --> 02:37:36.133]  These Delta Force guys and guys that go and work for DynCorp and the rest of it, they give them the shots with the DNA fragments that go into their tissues and then activate at a later date and give them cancer.
[02:37:37.614 --> 02:37:41.375]  I've seen Bill Clinton on TV drinking Diet Coke.
[02:37:41.435 --> 02:37:43.795]  I mean, they all do it to their own selves.
[02:37:43.835 --> 02:37:45.476]  This whole system is devilish.
[02:37:45.496 --> 02:37:46.876]  It's just against everybody.
[02:37:49.457 --> 02:37:50.397]  It's out of control.
[02:37:52.378 --> 02:37:53.519]  It's out of control.
[02:37:55.019 --> 02:37:56.160]  And it's going on everywhere.
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:37:58.021]  Now listen to this.
[02:37:58.041 --> 02:38:00.222]  Because this is important.
[02:38:00.242 --> 02:38:08.745]  I want to get into these Cheney Energy documents because they're extremely revealing.
[02:38:10.166 --> 02:38:12.707]  I'm trying to find the article.
[02:38:12.767 --> 02:38:14.028]  Man, all this news is important.
[02:38:14.048 --> 02:38:21.031]  I'm just going to blitz through it for the final six, seven minutes we've got left here of broadcast time.
[02:38:22.856 --> 02:38:24.698]  This is out of the London Telegraph today.
[02:38:24.778 --> 02:38:26.860]  Cheney had Iraq in sight two years ago.
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:28.682]  Of course, you don't have to believe them.
[02:38:28.722 --> 02:38:31.625]  You can just go to Judicial Watch or Infowars.com.
[02:38:32.205 --> 02:38:33.847]  He posted this on Friday.
[02:38:35.549 --> 02:38:37.290]  Judicial Watch released the documents.
[02:38:37.370 --> 02:38:43.494]  They finally got some of Cheney's energy documents from before 9-1-1, where he was meeting, already carving up Iraq.
[02:38:44.034 --> 02:38:48.737]  Of course, his other PNAC document says they were going to go in and get the oil before 9-1-1.
[02:38:49.317 --> 02:38:51.718]  Cheney had Iraq in sight two years ago.
[02:38:51.858 --> 02:38:53.920]  Now, 9-1-1 happened 22 months ago.
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:39:04.686]  Documents released under America's Freedom of Information Act revealed that an energy task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney was examining Iraq's oil assets two years before the latest war began.
[02:39:05.811 --> 02:39:18.238]  The papers were obtained after a long battle with the White House by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal charity that opposes government secrecy and which is suing for the dealings of the task force to be made public.
[02:39:18.699 --> 02:39:19.979]  This is just some of what they got.
[02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:21.520]  Most of it hadn't been released.
[02:39:23.101 --> 02:39:29.465]  The emergence of the documents could fuel claims that America's war in Iraq had as much to do with oil as national security.
[02:39:29.485 --> 02:39:34.428]  It also indicates that the Bush administration is beginning to lose the battle to keep its internal working secret.
[02:39:35.094 --> 02:39:41.302]  And don't think the military-industrial complex won't detonate a nuke or release smallpox to smokescreen all of this.
[02:39:41.663 --> 02:39:45.208]  We're in very bad trouble right now, and I pray to God to protect us.
[02:39:45.688 --> 02:39:47.090]  And you better pray that too, folks.
[02:39:47.471 --> 02:39:49.674]  Protect us from these people, oh Lord!
[02:39:50.928 --> 02:39:57.653]  The 16 pages dated March 2001 show maps of Iraq oil fields, pipelines, refineries, and terminals.
[02:39:58.134 --> 02:40:06.560]  A document titled Foreign Suitors for Iraq Oil Field Contracts is also included, listing which countries were keen to do business with the Saddam regime.
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:13.866]  Judicial Watch requested the papers two years ago and was threatened with arrest at the White House gate if they dropped the subpoena, which Clinton didn't even do.
[02:40:14.526 --> 02:40:23.159]  Judicial Watch requests the paper two years ago as part of its investigation into links between Bush administration and senior energy executives, including Enron's former chairman, Ken Lay.
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:29.241]  Mr. Cheney has fought the release of the documents at every stage.
[02:40:29.281 --> 02:40:33.762]  A court ordered two weeks ago that at least some of the task force's working papers should be made public.
[02:40:34.242 --> 02:40:35.062]  See, that's just some of it.
[02:40:35.482 --> 02:40:42.564]  Judicial Watch's president, Tom Fenton, said people will draw their own conclusions about the documents, but that is what an open society is about.
[02:40:43.004 --> 02:40:47.785]  Given the delay in the release, the Bush administration clearly did not want them to come out.
[02:40:50.525 --> 02:40:52.066]  And it gets worse and worse.
[02:40:52.086 --> 02:40:53.446]  You can go read the article for yourself.
[02:40:55.180 --> 02:40:57.502]  On InfoWars.com.
[02:40:58.743 --> 02:41:03.787]  And here is some of the other little tidbits of news.
[02:41:03.867 --> 02:41:04.327]  More U.S.
[02:41:04.347 --> 02:41:08.190]  troops being killed on a daily basis in ambushes and mass shootings.
[02:41:09.071 --> 02:41:11.853]  Construction of nuclear reactors in North Korea ongoing despite tension.
[02:41:11.973 --> 02:41:13.414]  Our government's building them despite tension.
[02:41:13.894 --> 02:41:16.376]  Lawsuit claims troops have ticket quotas.
[02:41:16.416 --> 02:41:17.337]  I'll hit that when we get back.
[02:41:18.604 --> 02:41:22.427]  Also, the government admits they can grab you for no reason and hold you for no reason.
[02:41:22.467 --> 02:41:23.087]  We're talking to that.
[02:41:23.187 --> 02:41:27.350]  Also, sharp rise in children's riddling news of 15-month-old babies.
[02:41:28.611 --> 02:41:33.334]  And the White House says that the weapons issue with Iraq was never central.
[02:41:33.394 --> 02:41:34.075]  It's secondary.
[02:41:36.784 --> 02:41:41.126]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:41.306 --> 02:41:45.728]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.888 --> 02:41:50.270]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:50.310 --> 02:41:51.611]  The New World Order.
[02:41:52.369 --> 02:41:55.150]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really
[02:42:19.582 --> 02:42:20.423]  We're good to go.
[02:42:20.443 --> 02:42:20.884]  We're good to go.
[02:42:37.583 --> 02:42:42.088]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:42:42.428 --> 02:42:46.532]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:42:46.832 --> 02:42:47.373]  We listened.
[02:42:47.673 --> 02:42:52.658]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:42:52.938 --> 02:42:53.419]  We listened.
[02:42:53.819 --> 02:42:56.842]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:42:57.283 --> 02:42:57.803]  We listened.
[02:42:58.284 --> 02:43:01.647]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:43:01.667 --> 02:43:02.227]  We're good to go.
[02:43:28.173 --> 02:43:29.134]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:43:29.154 --> 02:43:30.735]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:43:36.039 --> 02:43:42.884]  As a listener to the Genesis Communications Network, you're aware of the many health dangers that have been unleashed upon an unsuspecting public.
[02:43:43.345 --> 02:43:50.490]  We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but how do we do that without costly pharmaceutical products that trade benefits with side effects?
[02:43:50.950 --> 02:43:54.733]  Stabilized oxygen may be just the answer to this question and more.
[02:43:55.133 --> 02:44:02.519]  Stabilized oxygen is an oxidant similar to food-grade hydrogen peroxide, but it is more stable and effective with no unpleasant taste.
[02:44:02.919 --> 02:44:12.191]  By providing your bloodstream with molecular oxygen, it is possible to kill anaerobic bacteria and other parasites on contact without harming tissue or friendly bacteria.
[02:44:12.911 --> 02:44:16.195]  A 120-day supply of stabilized oxygen is just $15 postpaid.
[02:44:18.044 --> 02:44:27.970]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your four-month supply and get the best oxygen boost available in easy-to-take droplet form.

[02:45:01.710 --> 02:45:06.512]  Before I do that, I want to encourage every single listener of this show
[02:45:07.702 --> 02:45:08.803]  Forget my videos.
[02:45:09.103 --> 02:45:10.665]  America Destroyed by Design.
[02:45:10.905 --> 02:45:12.567]  Again, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:45:12.987 --> 02:45:13.608]  Police State 2000.

[02:45:17.872 --> 02:45:18.773]  My newest video.
[02:45:19.894 --> 02:45:20.854]  911, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:45:21.375 --> 02:45:22.676]  The Masters of Terror.
[02:45:23.077 --> 02:45:24.758]  My book, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:45:25.018 --> 02:45:25.919]  It's 230 pages.
[02:45:25.959 --> 02:45:27.020]  Covers September 11th.
[02:45:27.301 --> 02:45:29.042]  The History of Government-Sponsored Terrorism.
[02:45:29.082 --> 02:45:29.583]  It's only...
[02:45:30.183 --> 02:45:30.924]  We're good to go.
[02:45:54.306 --> 02:45:58.389]  We're called toll-free to purchase them and support the show at 1-888-253-3139.
[02:45:58.409 --> 02:45:59.069]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[02:45:59.089 --> 02:46:05.474]  And last but not least, you can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:46:22.961 --> 02:46:36.791]  Your purchase of the video supports this broadcast, and I want to thank those that have gotten them and have made copies for non-profit, not for sale purposes, that have aired them on AXIS TV and gotten them out to opinion makers and talk show hosts and elected officials in your area.
[02:46:36.891 --> 02:46:37.731]  God bless you.
[02:46:37.771 --> 02:46:41.394]  You're part of history, and Godspeed to you and your family.
[02:46:43.055 --> 02:46:43.776]  I'm out of time.
[02:46:44.016 --> 02:46:47.638]  Let me get to some news here in the last three minutes of the worldwide broadcast.
[02:46:48.779 --> 02:46:51.221]  Iraq weapons, now a secondary issue...
[02:46:52.443 --> 02:46:52.903]  The U.S.
[02:46:53.003 --> 02:46:58.286]  Defense Secretary says finding Iraq weapons of mass destruction is now a secondary issue.
[02:46:58.906 --> 02:46:59.066]  Ah!
[02:47:00.187 --> 02:47:06.109]  See, there's a lot of weapons over there, but they were all sold by the Russians of the U.S., and they're at known sites, so they can't talk about that in the news.
[02:47:06.730 --> 02:47:11.612]  The existence of such weapons was cited by Washington in London as a justification for going to war, but Paul Wolfowitz...
[02:47:13.027 --> 02:47:17.611]  Guy who loves Machiavelli and Trotsky says he's no longer concerned about them.
[02:47:18.011 --> 02:47:19.513]  In an interview on board a U.S.
[02:47:19.573 --> 02:47:27.980]  Air Force One jet returning from a five-day tour of Iraq, Mr. Wolfowitz said the task of setting the weapons question is in the hands of U.S.
[02:47:28.020 --> 02:47:29.201]  intelligence agencies.
[02:47:32.143 --> 02:47:33.524]  Oh, okay, that's nice.
[02:47:33.785 --> 02:47:34.525]  Just forget about it.
[02:47:34.545 --> 02:47:36.547]  We never said it, and they've been saying that in the news.
[02:47:36.587 --> 02:47:37.588]  It was never about weapons.
[02:47:38.168 --> 02:47:39.770]  That's a lie, a liberal lie.
[02:47:39.790 --> 02:47:41.271]  Well, you're the liberals, so shut up.
[02:47:43.001 --> 02:47:44.181]  And it goes on and on here.
[02:47:44.302 --> 02:47:44.502]  U.S.
[02:47:44.542 --> 02:47:46.062]  soldiers killed in Iraq ambush.
[02:47:46.182 --> 02:47:48.063]  Another soldier was killed in another convoy.
[02:47:48.083 --> 02:47:49.423]  It just goes on and on daily.
[02:47:49.443 --> 02:47:54.765]  I don't know why they think these Iraqi police are going to help them, because they're getting killed even more.
[02:47:54.785 --> 02:47:58.787]  The destruction of nuclear reactors in North Korea ongoing despite tension.
[02:47:58.807 --> 02:48:02.088]  This is out of San Francisco Chronicle, AP.
[02:48:03.496 --> 02:48:10.343]  A U.S.-led project to build two nuclear reactors in North Korea has proceeded despite the standoff between the communist states' suspected nuclear weapons development.
[02:48:10.683 --> 02:48:11.985]  South Korean officials said Wednesday.
[02:48:12.025 --> 02:48:13.086]  Talk about arming the enemy.
[02:48:13.726 --> 02:48:15.929]  Lawsuit claims troopers have ticket quotas.
[02:48:16.069 --> 02:48:21.975]  Ex-trooper of the year alleges that opposition to quota forced him out of South Carolina Highway Patrol.
[02:48:24.434 --> 02:48:24.674]  The U.S.
[02:48:25.595 --> 02:48:27.496]  and the federal government is pushing all these quotas.
[02:48:27.656 --> 02:48:33.761]  The South Carolina Highway Patrol operated a quota system that rewarded troopers who met ticket-writing goals and punished those who did not.
[02:48:34.181 --> 02:48:38.104]  A two-time trooper, two-time winner of the Trooper of the Year contends a federal lawsuit.
[02:48:38.925 --> 02:48:42.688]  Turns out this trooper's a big hero and saves people all the time and is very brave.
[02:48:43.128 --> 02:48:44.549]  He said, look, I'm not going to do this anymore.
[02:48:45.210 --> 02:48:46.291]  Just give old ladies tickets.
[02:48:46.351 --> 02:48:47.431]  And they said, you're out of there.
[02:48:48.452 --> 02:48:49.153]  Two-time winner.
[02:48:49.193 --> 02:48:49.953]  They want thugs.
[02:48:50.534 --> 02:48:51.214]  Another one here.
[02:48:51.254 --> 02:48:53.056]  This is out of the Charlotte Observer.
[02:48:54.394 --> 02:48:58.297]  That last article was out of another big paper.
[02:48:58.317 --> 02:49:01.119]  I'm trying to find it here before it ends.
[02:49:01.679 --> 02:49:05.582]  This is out of the state newspaper.
[02:49:05.862 --> 02:49:08.264]  This is out of the Charlotte Observer.
[02:49:08.944 --> 02:49:11.486]  Mistakes admitted to South Carolina mental jail stay.
[02:49:11.506 --> 02:49:16.289]  South Carolina mental health chief now says lack of funds was not the real reason.
[02:49:17.130 --> 02:49:24.095]  Turns out they held 70 people in jail despite the fact they've been ordered to be released for seven months.
[02:49:24.660 --> 02:49:25.862]  See you back tonight, back tomorrow.
[02:49:26.323 --> 02:49:29.828]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:49:30.068 --> 02:49:33.573]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:49:33.653 --> 02:49:37.198]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed...
