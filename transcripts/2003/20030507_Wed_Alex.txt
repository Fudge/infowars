[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.102]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.628 --> 00:00:15.308]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.069]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.891]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:20.332]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.052 --> 00:00:21.793]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:26.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:33.937]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.621]  Another powerful broadcast lined up for you.
[00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:44.662]  It is the 7th of May, 2020.
[00:00:47.842 --> 00:00:49.603]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:49.643 --> 00:00:52.124]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.204 --> 00:01:00.187]  We are tracking the latest global developments inside the crime syndicate known as the New World Order.
[00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:07.530]  And we're going to have wide-open phones, and I have Dr. Dennis Cuddy, an expert on the New World Order, an author joining us.
[00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.872]  He's written a book about 9-1-1 and government involvement and written books about government brainwashing in the schools.
[00:01:14.812 --> 00:01:36.046]  He is prolific, and you'll definitely, definitely want to hear this interview that's coming up in the second hour of the World Wide Broadcast as we radiate out on the AM and FM dial, simulcast on the Internet at InfoWars.com and Net and PrisonPlanet.com and Global Shortwave, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:36.886]  until 2 p.m.
[00:01:36.906 --> 00:01:39.208]  and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:43.755]  The shortwave frequency is 12.172 and 93.20, and that's during the day and at night, 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:47.719]  So that's the reality we're facing, my friends, a new world order in our face.
[00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:12.046]  I want to go ahead and launch into the news, but one thing I didn't mention yesterday that was in the news that I meant to mention was this thing about Saddam Hussein stealing a billion dollars.
[00:02:12.086 --> 00:02:13.868]  And the greatest bank robbery in history.
[00:02:13.908 --> 00:02:16.552]  Man, this guy is really bad.
[00:02:16.572 --> 00:02:18.094]  It was funny.
[00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:20.938]  The Mexican president...
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:38.231]  Actually got caught, I remember three presidents ago, not Fox, but the one before him, got caught taking $3 billion for blowing out his country's economy to the globalists, and then he moved to New York and works at the Wall Street Journal.
[00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.212]  That was Salinas.
[00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:43.815]  So we have that happening, $3 billion.
[00:02:43.855 --> 00:02:51.660]  We've heard of some of the commodities and exchange traders robbing tens of billions and getting caught.
[00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:55.092]  Saddam Hussein was a dictator of that country.
[00:02:55.152 --> 00:02:58.393]  He was a bad man, but nothing compared to many others.
[00:02:58.594 --> 00:03:01.055]  And he was a creature, a creation of the CIA.
[00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:02.255]  That's a historical fact.
[00:03:02.655 --> 00:03:06.917]  And it's patriotic to point that out, and patriotic to point out who armed him.
[00:03:08.258 --> 00:03:13.660]  But as I sit here and watch them hype up, oh, he's a bank robber.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.601]  I mean, this is total theater, folks.
[00:03:17.202 --> 00:03:18.082]  Just amazing.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.924]  And maybe you see through it, but I have some examples that everybody can see through.
[00:03:22.944 --> 00:03:26.306]  They now admit that the Private Lynch thing really wasn't a rescue.
[00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:27.347]  It was totally staged.
[00:03:27.387 --> 00:03:29.149]  The Iraqis had been gone for two days.
[00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:34.433]  The doctors had walked down the road and told them days before to come get her.
[00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:39.938]  The Special Forces, hours before the raid, had been across the street.
[00:03:40.398 --> 00:03:41.759]  They knew the area was deserted.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.421]  Turns out it was theater, Hollywood.
[00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:46.526]  But that's nothing compared to the Associated Press.
[00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:53.390]  Well, after it got to the editors, what was brought forward, now that the AP's planning false stories, we're really in trouble.
[00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.971]  The AP's usually a little bit better about that.
[00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:58.192]  I guess when they're overseas, though, they're just as bad.
[00:03:58.212 --> 00:04:01.074]  These are embedded reporters, government-approved.
[00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:11.853]  Turns out the Iraqis were carrying signs saying, killers out, and the signs have been posted, the photos in international press, and our media said, we're going to kill you.
[00:04:12.394 --> 00:04:16.756]  That supposedly the Iraqis were saying they were going to kill the American forces.
[00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:24.521]  So, classic lies, and they brought this forward after the last mass shooting, after the last Tiananmen Square.
[00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:29.064]  In many cases, Iraqis don't shoot, they don't throw rocks, they just get shot.
[00:04:29.952 --> 00:04:31.672]  And the same thing's happening over in Israel.
[00:04:31.712 --> 00:04:33.813]  They've been killing Reuters and AP writers.
[00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:46.475]  A British writer was just shot, and when his family came out to the site to be part of a protest, Israeli troops shot them.
[00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:50.496]  So, you know, and they're running over people with bulldozers.
[00:04:50.536 --> 00:04:52.396]  I mean, this is Tiananmen Square, folks.
[00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:54.056]  We cannot accept this.
[00:04:55.136 --> 00:04:55.877]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:57.957]  I've just got a ton of news from around the globe.
[00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:00.580]  Haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.241]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.082 --> 00:05:03.964]  We're going to take a lot of phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:04.305]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:11.727]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:12.107 --> 00:05:17.829]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:23.231]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:32.835]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:05:33.195 --> 00:05:38.158]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:05:38.478 --> 00:05:42.501]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:47.484]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:05:47.824 --> 00:05:53.708]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:05:54.068 --> 00:06:03.103]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:03.303 --> 00:06:04.245]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:05.387]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:16.818]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:06:17.138 --> 00:06:18.520]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.922]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:06:21.062 --> 00:06:23.164]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:28.368]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:06:28.708 --> 00:06:32.752]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:34.772]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:45.474]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and findable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:47.535]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:51.575]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:53.256]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[00:07:09.418 --> 00:07:12.999]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:14.659]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:16.580]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.021]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:07:22.381 --> 00:07:26.862]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:07:27.182 --> 00:07:35.804]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:07:36.324 --> 00:07:37.445]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:07:37.945 --> 00:07:41.688]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:07:41.968 --> 00:07:48.593]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:52.976]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[00:08:14.658 --> 00:08:15.278]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:17.000]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.841]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.482 --> 00:08:20.303]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.063 --> 00:08:21.944]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:21.964 --> 00:08:26.468]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.808 --> 00:08:30.912]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.597 --> 00:08:39.820]  We're already up to our necks in tyranny.
[00:08:41.028 --> 00:08:42.690]  Up to our necks in Terran.
[00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:48.255]  And we're being given a false sense of patriotism.
[00:08:48.275 --> 00:08:51.699]  We're being prepared to go into the World War III economy.
[00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:55.783]  We're being prepared to give up all of our liberty and freedom.
[00:08:56.784 --> 00:09:01.188]  We're being prepared for integration into the global plantation here inside the New World Order.
[00:09:02.012 --> 00:09:09.634]  And the more liberty you give up, the more tyranny you accept, the more terrorism you're going to see, because the globalists only stand to gain from it.
[00:09:09.654 --> 00:09:12.494]  And we have their track record documented.
[00:09:13.794 --> 00:09:27.317]  Not just the terrorism of the last decade, starting with the first World Trade Center attack in 1993, which the New York Times reported the bomb was cooked by FBI informant who tried to have them sting the bombing.
[00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:30.737]  Stop the bombing, and they were told, no, you let it go forward.
[00:09:31.277 --> 00:09:34.599]  Oklahoma City to World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:42.803]  Now, that's the reality.
[00:09:44.844 --> 00:09:46.065]  The New World Order is here.
[00:09:47.666 --> 00:09:48.546]  It's in our face.
[00:09:49.807 --> 00:09:51.108]  It's with us right now.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.781]  And they're preparing a national draft.
[00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:57.183]  Even if you don't serve overseas, you'll serve here.
[00:09:57.403 --> 00:09:59.144]  And yes, we've looked at the programs.
[00:09:59.664 --> 00:10:07.248]  Paddle-tail squads, anti-gun programs, environmental cult groups locally, literally what they are.
[00:10:09.329 --> 00:10:20.255]  Under George W. Bush, who's the titular head of things right now, they put a Republican in for this final destruction of America so conservatives would hesitate just long enough so they could get the job done.
[00:10:22.663 --> 00:10:25.085]  Under Lord Bush, the borders are more open than ever.
[00:10:25.445 --> 00:10:26.666]  Our enemies are being armed.
[00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:29.767]  Our Second Amendment is under the greatest attack ever seen.
[00:10:30.848 --> 00:10:32.609]  Our sovereignty is evaporating.
[00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.612]  Our liberties are being incinerated, decimated, annihilated.
[00:10:37.332 --> 00:10:42.796]  And the average conservative is in a love fest with beatnik neocons.
[00:10:44.717 --> 00:10:49.860]  With hippie, dope smoker enemy agents, basically.
[00:10:52.628 --> 00:10:53.889]  Now let's be honest, folks.
[00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.992]  I'm just using their terms and turning it back against them.
[00:10:57.012 --> 00:11:01.376]  It just so happens they are the very thing they claim is the neocon.
[00:11:02.398 --> 00:11:06.161]  They are the very thing they claim they're fighting for us against.
[00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:11.905]  But yesterday I read that headline, neocons call for a new world order.
[00:11:11.925 --> 00:11:15.087]  And it said, oh, they've got this crystal ball.
[00:11:15.507 --> 00:11:17.709]  They know when there's going to be a terror attack.
[00:11:17.809 --> 00:11:19.270]  Oh, they're so smart.
[00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.811]  Oh, they're going to take over the world.
[00:11:21.911 --> 00:11:25.554]  Oh, they're going to attack all these countries and bring freedom to them.
[00:11:26.966 --> 00:11:39.150]  You know, it was being heralded yesterday by the news channels, the neocon talk show host, and their twin brothers, like Chris Matthews, the publicly liberal individual, socialist individual, who's worshipping Bush on a daily basis.
[00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.751]  There ought to be a little indicator for you.
[00:11:42.231 --> 00:11:50.014]  They've been on the news, and they're saying to everyone that, oh, look, this will make the detractors shut up.
[00:11:50.034 --> 00:11:52.875]  They said it might be five years before there were elections in Iraq.
[00:11:53.275 --> 00:11:55.536]  And look, already in Mosul, an election!
[00:11:56.522 --> 00:12:02.509]  Well, I went and actually read our own government's release of what they've done in Mosul.
[00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:15.204]  Our government has chosen 200 people, former assets, still current assets, CIA, Kurd leaders, communists, others, and just like they chose Saddam to be the dictator of Iraq back in the 70s,
[00:12:16.252 --> 00:12:17.893]  Been their hitman since 58.
[00:12:18.514 --> 00:12:32.823]  Well, now they're just choosing 200 strong men, and they, quote, will elect, they will appoint the governor of that northern district, and the gubernatorial seat will be Mosul.
[00:12:32.923 --> 00:12:34.384]  Now, let me just explain something.
[00:12:35.285 --> 00:12:36.966]  That's not democracy.
[00:12:37.366 --> 00:12:43.310]  And by the way, we need a constitutional republic, and Iraq needs one, but they keep using this word democracy everywhere.
[00:12:44.162 --> 00:12:46.283]  That is the complete opposite of democracy.
[00:12:46.343 --> 00:12:49.284]  That is kangaroo puppet government.
[00:12:50.025 --> 00:12:52.666]  But the average person will scream at you, no, it's not.
[00:12:53.346 --> 00:13:08.113]  Okay, then they come into a population area bigger than Dallas-Fort Worth, over 5 million people in the northern area, region, state that Mosul's the capital of.
[00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:14.662]  And they're going in there, and they're setting this thing up.
[00:13:15.842 --> 00:13:20.543]  So there you have your New World Order.
[00:13:21.023 --> 00:13:24.944]  And I'm going to dig the article out later and read it to you.
[00:13:25.664 --> 00:13:30.565]  But imagine appointing 200 people who are then going to, quote, vote.
[00:13:30.785 --> 00:13:35.086]  Oh, yes, I'm sure they haven't been told who to vote for.
[00:13:36.006 --> 00:13:39.627]  I'm sure it's not going to be the governor that our government's already announced is in force.
[00:13:40.422 --> 00:13:52.548]  And did you know that when this governor, this is when this mass shooting started about three, four weeks ago, this governor went to speak there in the northern city and said, you know, go along, do what the Americans say.
[00:13:52.668 --> 00:14:04.474]  Somebody threw a rock, so our troops will come by here and be police officers, mowed down over 100 people, killing now the number is 15, and they say one more died of complications, so it's 16.
[00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:10.531]  In a few of the cases, somebody has shot at the troops, and our troops are fired back.
[00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:15.253]  And there's video of it, haphazardly, just spraying whole crowds.
[00:14:16.973 --> 00:14:19.974]  So I guess the lesson is, don't go out and don't protest.
[00:14:20.395 --> 00:14:31.559]  The point is, it looks just exactly, precisely, specifically like Tiananmen Square, over and over and over again.
[00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:33.840]  And I go back to a month ago in Israel,
[00:14:35.155 --> 00:15:03.283]  A young woman from Michigan, a college student, looked like middle America, sitting there, bagging the tank, the armored bulldozer, begging it not to run over her, the hem of her garment getting caught under it, and begging, and the bulldozer captain laughing, running over her, and then, oh, it gets better, backing back over her.
[00:15:03.343 --> 00:15:04.183]  This is all on tape.
[00:15:06.013 --> 00:15:08.335]  And the bloody mass, bleeding to death right there.
[00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:14.360]  Well, since they've been killing all these reporters and cameramen and everybody, family members have been going and protesting.
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:22.927]  And two days ago, some family members of one of the British photographers for Reuters, who was shot, the family went to the scene where he'd been shot.
[00:15:23.427 --> 00:15:28.932]  He was doing a documentary on the bulldozing of the Palestinian homes, and the family got shot.
[00:15:30.848 --> 00:15:38.351]  And there's now video and photos of British and German and American reporters waving white flags being hit by snipers.
[00:15:38.791 --> 00:15:47.974]  There are shots of an AP reporter standing there with his press vest on, running to the aid of a 10-year-old child who'd just been shot.
[00:15:47.994 --> 00:15:50.335]  I mean, who has humanity?
[00:15:50.715 --> 00:16:00.278]  We saw a child flopping around on the ground, blood spewing, would run to the child, and on tape, the Israeli takes careful aim
[00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:04.797]  And shoots the reporter in the head, killing him.
[00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:15.023]  You see a guy come out of the top of a tank, aim, the Reuters TV cameraman zooms in to watch his colleague have his head blown off.
[00:16:17.004 --> 00:16:29.811]  Now, folks, you add this to the equation with Ariel Sharon three months ago saying in the United Press International, AP, they all carried it, saying in an address...
[00:16:30.592 --> 00:16:36.255]  They're going to kill Americans when and wherever they want in America.
[00:16:37.336 --> 00:16:41.798]  And Bush seconded that by saying, yeah, the CIA will kill you too.
[00:16:43.179 --> 00:16:45.420]  No judge, no jury, no arrest.
[00:16:46.441 --> 00:16:49.162]  Now, is this what our founding fathers fought for?
[00:16:49.262 --> 00:16:53.765]  Is this what our men charged the beaches in Iwo Jima and Normandy for?
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:00.701]  That's the type of stuff they did in Japan and Nazi Germany and Communist China and Russia and Fidel's Cuba.
[00:17:02.682 --> 00:17:04.402]  It's being institutionalized.
[00:17:04.462 --> 00:17:08.743]  And by the way, they're teaching police that protesting, demonstrating isn't really allowed.
[00:17:09.703 --> 00:17:11.223]  They're giving them automatic weapons.
[00:17:13.264 --> 00:17:16.244]  They're giving them all of these different systems.
[00:17:17.885 --> 00:17:20.125]  And I, for one, am not going to put up with it.
[00:17:21.718 --> 00:17:27.802]  They're mounting helicopters with spray bottles with knockout gas to knock out whole sections of cities.
[00:17:28.142 --> 00:17:28.983]  This is admitted.
[00:17:29.443 --> 00:17:31.265]  What did we do to deserve this?
[00:17:31.865 --> 00:17:32.305]  Nothing.
[00:17:32.365 --> 00:17:33.546]  We put up with tyranny.
[00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.467]  We became fat and happy.
[00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:37.729]  We trusted government.
[00:17:38.089 --> 00:17:42.292]  It built its national security dictatorship, and now it's taken over.
[00:17:45.054 --> 00:17:50.918]  And we're going to be molded and terrorized into accepting being parts of this giant world empire now.
[00:17:53.109 --> 00:17:55.490]  And now it's coming out, U.S.
[00:17:55.511 --> 00:17:57.332]  troops encouraged Iraqi looters.
[00:17:58.132 --> 00:18:04.216]  General Tommy Franks is threatening with a Belgian war crimes trial, alleging U.S.
[00:18:04.256 --> 00:18:05.997]  troops failed to prevent looting in Iraq.
[00:18:06.657 --> 00:18:14.522]  ABC News, Uncommercial Evidence, suggesting these soldiers even engaged and egged on some looters.
[00:18:14.562 --> 00:18:17.524]  Well, my goodness, folks, there's footage of our troops
[00:18:18.376 --> 00:18:28.261]  The globalist troops now, cutting the gold out of the ceilings, running around with pictures, framed oil paintings in gold jars.
[00:18:29.282 --> 00:18:30.403]  And what does our government do?
[00:18:30.463 --> 00:18:37.467]  Very craftily, they arrest troops who took home a few bayonets, which everybody's grandpa or father did.
[00:18:38.467 --> 00:18:39.928]  Nothing wrong with a war trophy.
[00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:43.006]  And then everybody says, oh, leave the troops alone.
[00:18:43.046 --> 00:18:43.926]  This is so dumb.
[00:18:43.966 --> 00:18:51.210]  Look at the looting a few bayonets when there's been systematic looting by this global government of the art treasures.
[00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:59.974]  It was not the Iraqi people hauling off 5,000-pound statues of Nebuchadnezzar, let me assure you.
[00:19:02.175 --> 00:19:03.876]  This stuff is worth billions.
[00:19:03.916 --> 00:19:05.957]  This stuff has more antiquity than Egypt.
[00:19:06.137 --> 00:19:10.179]  Just that part of the world has been so shut down and closed down that no one's been able to look at it.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.281]  I've been able to enjoy it.
[00:19:14.062 --> 00:19:14.843]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:19:15.163 --> 00:19:16.965]  So, I'm tired of being lied to.
[00:19:17.025 --> 00:19:18.446]  I mean, they've got this northern city.
[00:19:18.486 --> 00:19:20.548]  They're appointing this governor.
[00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:23.410]  And people aren't buying it.
[00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.932]  So they go, okay, we're going to have an election.
[00:19:24.952 --> 00:19:30.456]  We're going to appoint 200 local leaders to, quote, vote on who the leader will be.
[00:19:30.617 --> 00:19:32.658]  Our government's going to appoint the 200 that vote?
[00:19:33.219 --> 00:19:34.120]  I mean, folks, come on.
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.321]  That's what they did in Afghanistan.
[00:19:36.221 --> 00:19:36.922]  This is a joke.
[00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:45.630]  And now, of course, poppy production is at world records in Afghanistan, and smack, that deadly poison is hitting the streets.
[00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:53.673]  Well, don't worry, the SWAT team's going to raid your house without a warrant, tear your walls down, and not even apologize when they don't find the drugs their bosses shipped in.
[00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:58.115]  All right, I'm going to come back and talk about the world news, latest developments.
[00:19:58.135 --> 00:19:59.195]  We're going to take a lot of calls.
[00:19:59.235 --> 00:20:06.238]  We've got Dr. Dennis Cuddy, a guest, coming on, talking about the New World Order, an expert in the second and third hour today.
[00:20:06.949 --> 00:20:08.330]  We'll take a lot of calls in the first hour.
[00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.090]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.791]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:17.613]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:18.793]  Probably never, right?

[00:24:41.624 --> 00:24:44.086]  It's like the Bush administration has nothing to lose.
[00:24:44.127 --> 00:24:45.448]  They're going all the way.
[00:24:45.588 --> 00:24:57.618]  Richard Perle has given, well, written public documents, according to a bunch of mainstream newspapers here, where he told investors, oh yeah, invest with us, you'll have lots of profits off the war.
[00:24:59.051 --> 00:25:05.735]  And these guys had the project for the new American century where they said that Saddam, quote, wasn't a threat.
[00:25:05.755 --> 00:25:06.736]  We'll get the oil.
[00:25:06.776 --> 00:25:10.018]  We'll have a military base for a new world order.
[00:25:11.519 --> 00:25:12.860]  They're saying it again.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.581]  Crystal's saying it again.
[00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:17.182]  And here it is.
[00:25:17.242 --> 00:25:20.064]  Halliburton contract goes beyond fires.
[00:25:20.264 --> 00:25:21.445]  This is out of AP.
[00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:22.366]  Well, of course it did.
[00:25:22.386 --> 00:25:24.607]  You didn't think they were going to get $7 million for nothing.
[00:25:25.262 --> 00:25:31.587]  And it turns out we're going to go ahead and pump the oil for themselves and have decided it's going to belong to Halliburton free of charge.
[00:25:32.087 --> 00:25:42.214]  A large portion will be sent to the port of Haifa in Israel out of northern Iraq.
[00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:49.019]  So, publicly taking their oil, and if you come out and protest, well, the liberators mow you down.
[00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:52.041]  What's up, Patriot E-Boy?
[00:25:52.808 --> 00:25:55.532]  You should not ought to tell us about what's happening.
[00:25:55.973 --> 00:26:00.039]  How a Burton contract goes beyond fires, an emergency contract...
[00:26:00.603 --> 00:26:04.486]  The Bush administration gave to Halliburton Company to extinguish Iraqi oil fires.
[00:26:04.506 --> 00:26:06.147]  Oh, it was an emergency.
[00:26:06.447 --> 00:26:07.968]  That's why no bids were allowed.
[00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:14.914]  Oil fires also gave the firm a more lucrative role in getting the country's oil system up and running, documents show.
[00:26:15.494 --> 00:26:21.598]  And now we learn that Bechtel is in the back pocket of Carlyle and the Bin Ladens and their companies.
[00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:23.540]  Of course, of course, it's one group.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.341]  Here's another one.
[00:26:26.481 --> 00:26:30.644]  Army Corps expands on Halliburton Democratic citizens.
[00:26:31.405 --> 00:26:35.048]  Democrat criticizes possibility of pumping and selling Iraqi crude.
[00:26:35.068 --> 00:26:36.529]  See, it's always a Democrat.
[00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.072]  That way it can be howled by the neocons.
[00:26:39.192 --> 00:26:41.854]  Oh, it's those liberals as usual.
[00:26:42.194 --> 00:26:45.877]  What about Al Gore and Occidental?
[00:26:45.918 --> 00:26:47.479]  Yeah, they're all corrupt.
[00:26:50.091 --> 00:26:52.135]  It's the old game of how they point at each other.
[00:26:52.176 --> 00:26:52.737]  It doesn't matter.
[00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:53.679]  They're all together.
[00:26:53.719 --> 00:26:57.468]  It's two con artists working together, acting like they're good cop, bad cop.
[00:26:59.008 --> 00:27:06.370]  On Tuesday, a key House Democrat continued his attacks on the Army Corps of Engineers' decision to hire Houston-based Halliburton Company.
[00:27:06.831 --> 00:27:15.093]  Oh, yeah, that's Dick Cheney's company, and he's the deputy commander-in-chief, the vice president, and then the Army Corps chooses them.
[00:27:15.613 --> 00:27:20.695]  Under an exclusive but short-term contract to perform emergency repair work in Iraq's oil field.
[00:27:20.955 --> 00:27:21.715]  Oh, of course.
[00:27:22.716 --> 00:27:23.616]  All short-term.
[00:27:24.336 --> 00:27:26.637]  CBS News, a new furor over...
[00:27:27.555 --> 00:27:28.276]  Halliburton.
[00:27:28.676 --> 00:27:40.907]  Halliburton Company's emergency no-bid contract to work on Iraq's oil wells must be fully disclosed, the Democratic lawmaker says, pointing to Army's admission that the company has a far more lucrative role than originally believed.
[00:27:42.344 --> 00:27:43.045]  We're good to go.
[00:28:11.124 --> 00:28:16.754]  I mean, the money just goes directly into Israel's pocket and directly into Dick Cheney's pocket and into Pearl's pocket.
[00:28:18.176 --> 00:28:19.438]  Here's Caval Hill Blue.
[00:28:19.598 --> 00:28:22.203]  Pearl told investors they could profit from war.
[00:28:23.283 --> 00:28:33.473]  Pentagon advisor Richard Perle briefed an investment seminar on ways to profit from conflicts in Iraq and North Korea just weeks after he received a top senior government briefing on the crisis in the two countries.
[00:28:33.993 --> 00:28:39.539]  And Perle, last week the New York Times reported, said, Oh, get ready, don't worry, we're going to invade North Korea.
[00:28:39.999 --> 00:28:46.706]  And Rumsfeld's dossier got released three weeks ago of how they're going to bomb and attack first North Korea.
[00:28:47.518 --> 00:28:49.779]  Now, they leaked that on purpose.
[00:28:49.839 --> 00:28:53.541]  This is all on purpose to the psychopath, so he'll hit us first, folks.
[00:28:53.581 --> 00:28:54.622]  Talk about a Pearl Harbor.
[00:28:55.983 --> 00:29:03.447]  Pearl, who until March was chairman of the Defense Policy Board, a group of outside advisors of the Pentagon, also served on the board of several defense contractors.
[00:29:03.487 --> 00:29:06.408]  His actions raised concerns about conflicts of interest.
[00:29:07.349 --> 00:29:09.130]  And what's his nickname there at the Pentagon?
[00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:10.350]  The Prince of Darkness.
[00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:15.073]  And he's a known, basically, well, he's something else is what he is.
[00:29:16.037 --> 00:29:18.198]  A financial advisor participated in the conference.
[00:29:18.718 --> 00:29:19.939]  All told, Capitol Hill blew.
[00:29:20.079 --> 00:29:22.440]  Pearl offered advice on how to cash in on war.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.842]  And when it broke out in Iraq and or North Korea, Pearl did not return phone calls or email-seeking comments.
[00:29:30.543 --> 00:29:32.104]  The old Prince of Darkness.
[00:29:32.224 --> 00:29:33.184]  Really nice guy.
[00:29:33.224 --> 00:29:34.905]  He literally glows in the dark.
[00:29:35.725 --> 00:29:38.126]  Americans debating the world empires.
[00:29:38.166 --> 00:29:39.367]  The ABC News headline.
[00:29:40.347 --> 00:29:42.888]  A lot of people are going, yeah, we're an empire now.
[00:29:42.908 --> 00:29:45.289]  I've heard them in grocery stores and checkout lanes.
[00:29:46.178 --> 00:29:48.020]  Yeah, it feels good to be this powerful.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.321]  You're going to be a slave.
[00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:50.743]  You're not part of the power.
[00:29:51.043 --> 00:29:51.744]  You understand?
[00:29:51.764 --> 00:29:56.749]  It's like somebody in the Volkswagen with Ted Bundy saying they're part of the power.
[00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:57.530]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.513 --> 00:30:01.414]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.894 --> 00:30:03.536]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.556 --> 00:30:07.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.316 --> 00:30:12.097]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:17.919]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:18.239 --> 00:30:19.099]  Probably never, right?
[00:30:19.379 --> 00:30:21.540]  Hey, folks, Michael Trudeau here.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.900]  Call the ARC Institute today.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.380]  Toll-free 1-800-255-1912.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.641]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arcinstitute.com.
[00:30:40.982 --> 00:30:46.145]  If you want to use the popular political paradigm terms, I'm a conservative.
[00:30:46.385 --> 00:30:47.666]  I believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:30:47.766 --> 00:30:49.248]  I believe in family values.
[00:30:49.648 --> 00:30:51.429]  I believe in national sovereignty.
[00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:53.130]  I can't stand corruption.
[00:30:53.631 --> 00:31:07.801]  And let me just tell you again, the scumballs like Chuckie Schumer are in bed with Lord Bush and Pearl and the rest of them as they publicly give themselves giant contracts and
[00:31:08.942 --> 00:31:10.203]  You know, I read this article.
[00:31:10.223 --> 00:31:11.564]  There was a bunch of articles about it.
[00:31:11.584 --> 00:31:24.094]  It's a federal government announcement that the Iraqi people, in all the new jobs in Iraq, food service, water treatment, oil wells, everywhere, will receive $20 a month.
[00:31:24.695 --> 00:31:33.742]  Now, folks, that puts, I looked it up, Iraq in the top ten poorest countries.
[00:31:34.855 --> 00:31:38.976]  People in most African nations make more than $20 a month.
[00:31:39.457 --> 00:31:41.077]  The worst African nations.
[00:31:41.557 --> 00:31:43.818]  The worst of Asian nations.
[00:31:44.638 --> 00:31:48.760]  Our government is lavishly overflowing with cashola for everyone.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.161]  There's only, I don't know, 19 million people in Iraq.
[00:31:53.181 --> 00:31:58.743]  There were 22 million, but, you know, they've had a bad time the last 12 years after getting set up.
[00:31:58.943 --> 00:32:04.405]  Their CIA boss got set up following orders, and now you know what happened.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.602]  And $20 a month.
[00:32:09.142 --> 00:32:13.205]  And don't worry, after lots of crises and disasters here, you'll be like that too.
[00:32:14.305 --> 00:32:15.606]  You'll be like that in America.
[00:32:15.666 --> 00:32:16.607]  And you're going to love it.
[00:32:16.627 --> 00:32:23.071]  You're going to thank them for your national ID card and the little federal shops you drop by for to get your food.
[00:32:23.572 --> 00:32:25.193]  The government said that's the plan.
[00:32:25.513 --> 00:32:26.774]  Troops in all the factories.
[00:32:26.794 --> 00:32:28.615]  A couple more terrorist attacks.
[00:32:29.336 --> 00:32:30.817]  You're going to be good slaves.
[00:32:30.897 --> 00:32:35.320]  You're going to have lots of pictures of the dictator up in your house and kiss them and
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.880]  Hand your guns in and call a conservative.
[00:32:38.301 --> 00:32:39.921]  I'm not joking when I say this.
[00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:43.502]  No, I'm not joking.
[00:32:43.522 --> 00:32:46.922]  $20 a month, and I dug the article out.
[00:32:47.122 --> 00:32:47.383]  U.S.
[00:32:47.443 --> 00:32:49.583]  tries limited elections in Mosul.
[00:32:49.983 --> 00:32:51.043]  Sunday Morning Herald.
[00:32:51.823 --> 00:32:51.943]  U.S.
[00:32:51.963 --> 00:33:01.706]  forces have brokered council elections in Iraq's third city of Mosul, in which the numbers of seats for each group will be fixed in advance of the effort to reduce ethnic tensions.
[00:33:02.386 --> 00:33:03.466]  Even this article's for it.
[00:33:04.051 --> 00:33:18.362]  The election is to be held in a heavily guarded public hall, allocates 10 of the 18 council seats to the city's Arab majority, with three seats to the Kurds, two to the Christians, and one each for the Turkmen, Assyrian Christians, and Yazids.
[00:33:19.563 --> 00:33:31.451]  And it goes in a pattern likely to be repeated across Iraq, the members of the interim council will be chosen by an electorate of about 200 prominent local leaders, and ordinary citizens will not have a vote.
[00:33:31.812 --> 00:33:31.912]  Oh!
[00:33:32.806 --> 00:33:40.149]  200 people appointed by the globalists, literally, will then elect the council and the governor.
[00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:46.952]  Now, folks, that is textbook how you put puppet governments in.
[00:33:46.992 --> 00:33:49.653]  It's not even a semblance of it being a puppet.
[00:33:51.834 --> 00:33:53.975]  The strings are bigger than the puppet.
[00:33:55.996 --> 00:33:56.296]  So...
[00:33:58.306 --> 00:33:59.467]  I mean, I'm just blown away.
[00:34:00.167 --> 00:34:02.488]  We'll go to your calls if you want to join me.
[00:34:04.188 --> 00:34:08.970]  On air, the toll-free number on this live Wednesday edition of the Worldwide Broadcast, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.270]  800-259-9231.
[00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:15.553]  I'll go to Mark in Minnesota and others in just a second.
[00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:19.234]  First, I want to plug a couple things briefly here, but they are important, so please take note.
[00:34:26.543 --> 00:34:39.031]  I am going to be doing a public appearance up in Kansas City, Missouri next Saturday, not this Saturday, but next Saturday, May 17, 2003, 10 a.m.
[00:34:39.071 --> 00:34:40.812]  until 6.30 p.m.
[00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:52.880]  And the location is the Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center, 5200 Blue Ridge Boulevard between I-70, between Kansas City and Independence, Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:34:54.273 --> 00:35:03.496]  And Colonel Craig Roberts, author of One Shot, One Kill, police officer, Army intelligence, New World Order expert, will be doing a PowerPoint presentation for two hours.
[00:35:03.956 --> 00:35:05.537]  I'll be doing a two-hour presentation.
[00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:08.898]  We have other speakers like John Stattner and others that are going to be there.
[00:35:09.799 --> 00:35:14.000]  And all proceeds, $15, go to KCXL.
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.862]  They wanted to give me some of the money, but I said, you know, I don't like the Patriots for profit.
[00:35:19.282 --> 00:35:20.342]  I'll come up and sell my videos.
[00:35:20.382 --> 00:35:20.802]  That's fine.
[00:35:20.822 --> 00:35:22.223]  But you just keep the money.
[00:35:22.791 --> 00:35:33.880]  You've had us on for three years telling the truth, so I'll come and speak at your event, and this will certainly help you guys expand your operation and increase your power and everything else.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.680]  So they're great folks.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.242]  I hope a lot of you come.
[00:35:36.302 --> 00:35:39.944]  I hear thousands are planning, and it's a big place, holds 8,000.
[00:35:40.025 --> 00:35:41.886]  I figure we'll have a couple thousand.
[00:35:42.446 --> 00:35:44.388]  You'll definitely want to come out to the event.
[00:35:45.008 --> 00:35:47.130]  KCXL, 1140 a.m.
[00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.452]  The Liberty Factor is what it's been dubbed by.
[00:35:49.512 --> 00:35:50.693]  Craig Roberts came up with the name.
[00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.250]  I believe that's what they told me.
[00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.571]  And May 17, 2003, Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center.
[00:35:58.132 --> 00:36:02.553]  And they, again, wanted just me to come speak, myself to come speak.
[00:36:02.993 --> 00:36:04.413]  And I said, no, let's have some other speakers.
[00:36:04.513 --> 00:36:06.354]  So that's going to be a great deal.
[00:36:06.394 --> 00:36:08.234]  And I hope to see everybody out there.
[00:36:08.774 --> 00:36:12.875]  You need to call and get your tickets ahead of time from the radio station.
[00:36:13.555 --> 00:36:19.757]  And I guess I need to create a link or something with a phone number for the station or the procedure of how folks get tickets.
[00:36:20.782 --> 00:36:22.443]  Because it could turn into standing room only.
[00:36:22.463 --> 00:36:27.424]  You've got to get your advance ticket to make sure you're not standing up if the thousand chairs get filled up.
[00:36:28.445 --> 00:36:29.365]  So that's important.
[00:36:30.425 --> 00:36:38.428]  Other side note, I am running on three hours sleep, and I've done this about four days straight.
[00:36:38.728 --> 00:36:40.269]  I do this a couple times a year.
[00:36:40.929 --> 00:36:41.849]  Well, more than that.
[00:36:42.149 --> 00:36:46.231]  Maybe that's why I look more like Jabba the Hutt instead of James Bond like I used to look.
[00:36:46.271 --> 00:36:47.391]  But the point is...
[00:36:49.796 --> 00:36:53.377]  The point is, I have completed a new film.
[00:36:53.397 --> 00:36:54.277]  It is done.
[00:36:54.297 --> 00:36:58.938]  It is being mass-produced as we speak.
[00:36:59.739 --> 00:37:04.420]  So on the website we say that it ships in one week, and that's accurate.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:12.782]  If you want your order sent out first, you'll definitely want to go to InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[00:37:14.893 --> 00:37:22.457]  Or prisonplanet.com and click on the shopping cart to order Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:37:22.917 --> 00:37:27.380]  If you haven't gotten Police State 2000 or Police State 2 The Takeover, you need to get those as well.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.541]  The films are $25.95.
[00:37:29.621 --> 00:37:32.983]  This film is 2 hours and 37 minutes long.
[00:37:34.544 --> 00:37:38.606]  If you order 3 or more of any of the videos, they drop down to $20.
[00:37:39.006 --> 00:37:44.069]  So I suggest you get Police State 2000, The Takeover, and now Total Enslavement because they all go together.
[00:37:44.733 --> 00:37:45.814]  Kind of a box set.
[00:37:46.334 --> 00:37:52.719]  Of course, I have 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, about September 11th, and the total takeover plan.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.922]  I don't want you to get the videos unless you're going to make copies.
[00:37:57.243 --> 00:38:00.846]  For non-profit, educational, not-for-sale purposes.
[00:38:00.886 --> 00:38:04.248]  You're not authorized to make copies of the films for sale, folks.
[00:38:04.909 --> 00:38:10.894]  You are authorized to get them and to make copies to hand out to friends and family, to get to opinion makers in your area.
[00:38:10.974 --> 00:38:11.174]  So...
[00:38:12.111 --> 00:38:17.474]  Go to InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:31.152]  That's 888-253-3139, or InfoWars.com or net, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:38:31.272 --> 00:38:32.633]  Again, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:38:55.388 --> 00:39:01.571]  All right, I have poured my life's blood into these films.
[00:39:02.171 --> 00:39:06.474]  My burning the candle at both ends in the defense of the republic.
[00:39:06.774 --> 00:39:10.676]  If this was the Alamo, they're coming over the wall in the defense of the republic.
[00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:19.040]  And we're defending against the New World Order, the European bankers that own our government, and we must educate people if we're ever going to have liberty.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.941]  Mark in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[00:39:20.981 --> 00:39:21.321]  Go ahead.
[00:39:22.023 --> 00:39:22.544]  Hey, Alex.
[00:39:22.584 --> 00:39:23.125]  How are you doing, sir?
[00:39:23.406 --> 00:39:24.007]  Oh, pretty good.
[00:39:24.988 --> 00:39:32.221]  I seldom watch TV, but I just happened to be watching this night show last night, and Dennis Miller was on there.
[00:39:32.856 --> 00:39:41.278]  And I always seem to... So-called ultra-socialist anti-gun, now worshipping Bush, pro-war, anti-freedom.
[00:39:41.618 --> 00:39:45.579]  Of course, this is a liberal sneak attack.
[00:39:46.239 --> 00:39:50.420]  I mean, nothing but praise and accolades for Bush.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.181]  I mean, Sig Hale, George Bush.
[00:39:52.221 --> 00:39:52.801]  Let me tell you something.
[00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:56.622]  I have him on tape literally engaging in a ten-minute worship session.
[00:39:56.662 --> 00:39:58.022]  Yes, you saw that then.
[00:39:58.462 --> 00:39:59.643]  Well, no, I saw him months ago.
[00:39:59.703 --> 00:40:01.064]  It's wall-to-wall, sir.
[00:40:01.385 --> 00:40:10.713]  Look, when Bush first got in, I saw liberals, and again, they're not liberals, they're fascist control freaks, but they call themselves liberals, on... The globalists are all about changing labels.
[00:40:10.753 --> 00:40:12.554]  They call themselves conservatives, they're fascists.
[00:40:12.574 --> 00:40:16.518]  You know, it's the socialist, fascist, same thing, command and control.
[00:40:17.518 --> 00:40:22.122]  And I saw the socialist on Laird NewsHour worshipping Bush right after the election.
[00:40:22.162 --> 00:40:23.824]  I said, look out, folks.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.603]  Yeah, I tell you, but hey, Bush is conservative because CNN tells us so, Alex.
[00:40:29.963 --> 00:40:32.204]  Hey, did you hear about that ABC News headline I just mentioned?
[00:40:33.185 --> 00:40:33.805]  Which one was that?
[00:40:34.645 --> 00:40:42.428]  Americans debating the world empire, world empire being used more often these days to describe America's global role.
[00:40:42.948 --> 00:40:55.173]  So now they're admitting, yesterday, neocons called for new world order, that was Knight Ritter newspapers, now ABC News, world government, world empire, it's in our face now.
[00:40:56.114 --> 00:40:59.555]  Yeah, I tell you, and you're so right, Alex, you know,
[00:41:00.596 --> 00:41:09.702]  Americans have been so swamped and inundated with status propaganda that they literally believe that they are one with the emperor.
[00:41:09.942 --> 00:41:11.563]  And I've seen this over and over.
[00:41:11.964 --> 00:41:16.246]  In fact, I've heard people say, what's wrong with the world empire?
[00:41:16.266 --> 00:41:22.610]  And what's wrong with looking out for economic interests so that there may be oil involved?
[00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.952]  Hey, Mark, let me just stop you and I'll let you jump back in.
[00:41:25.412 --> 00:41:29.715]  About two weeks ago, I was taking the family out.
[00:41:30.857 --> 00:42:00.005]  And I was, my wife, my parents were in the car, we're going out to eat, and I run into the store, pay for the gas, and I'm standing there, and a guy with Iron Cross tattoos, everything else is in there, a Mr. Trendy, who's not trendy at all, establishment brainwashed, you know, carbon copy cookie cutter creature, and he's buying this proud to be an American decal at the front counter, and he goes, man, I'll tell you, I love it, all this oil we're getting.
[00:42:00.934 --> 00:42:02.534]  And I go, oh, oil.
[00:42:02.594 --> 00:42:03.875]  And he says, yeah, it's great.
[00:42:03.895 --> 00:42:07.055]  And I'm like, well, you don't think you're going to get that oil, do you?
[00:42:07.415 --> 00:42:08.095]  I don't care.
[00:42:08.355 --> 00:42:08.936]  We're tough.
[00:42:09.816 --> 00:42:12.056]  And the guy behind the counter started laughing at him.
[00:42:12.116 --> 00:42:13.396]  He goes, hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:42:13.416 --> 00:42:14.557]  The guy behind the counter knew who I was.
[00:42:14.597 --> 00:42:17.017]  And I said, look, don't you know they're killing people over there?
[00:42:17.037 --> 00:42:18.017]  Don't you know this is a fraud?
[00:42:18.037 --> 00:42:19.577]  They told us it wasn't about oil.
[00:42:19.638 --> 00:42:20.178]  Now they admit it.
[00:42:20.698 --> 00:42:21.478]  Ah, so what?
[00:42:21.518 --> 00:42:22.058]  We need it.
[00:42:22.418 --> 00:42:24.558]  I said, sir, you're not part of the establishment.
[00:42:24.998 --> 00:42:25.619]  They can't.
[00:42:25.919 --> 00:42:27.559]  They're like a poor North Korean.
[00:42:28.354 --> 00:42:31.235]  Who just loves Kim Jong-il, but you can't help these people.
[00:42:31.535 --> 00:42:36.936]  Yeah, I mean, it's like they really think they're literally one with them, but they're like, yo, we should go over there and get oil.
[00:42:36.976 --> 00:42:39.457]  Bush and I, you know I support him.
[00:42:39.697 --> 00:42:47.699]  And I just have to tell him, hey, you know, we're not getting oil any more than we taxed ourselves and we had an affair with Monica Bell.
[00:42:48.019 --> 00:42:57.801]  Well, do you realize what it means, Mark, when you've got a president landing on jets, walking around in military uniforms, always being seen, surrounded by troops more often than not,
[00:42:58.672 --> 00:43:03.038]  I mean, that's what they do in Red Square or in Havana, Cuba.
[00:43:03.439 --> 00:43:06.844]  Folks, that's always a Caesar with his legions in Rome.
[00:43:07.325 --> 00:43:08.526]  They're doing it right now.
[00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:12.292]  And people, they literally think...
[00:43:12.936 --> 00:43:14.517]  They're one with the emperor, and you're so right.
[00:43:14.637 --> 00:43:17.279]  I mean, people are going to be kissing pictures of George Bush.
[00:43:17.319 --> 00:43:17.840]  They already are.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:18.300]  Are you kidding?
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:21.022]  All the conservative websites are selling photos.
[00:43:21.782 --> 00:43:25.905]  I have literally seen people, conservatives I know, that are walking around.
[00:43:25.925 --> 00:43:28.868]  You see them walking from their car at the TV station with a picture of him to hang up.
[00:43:29.768 --> 00:43:30.309]  Hi, Alex.
[00:43:30.869 --> 00:43:33.071]  Bush, you know, wants to reinstate the assault weapons ban.
[00:43:33.091 --> 00:43:33.831]  The border is wide open.
[00:43:33.851 --> 00:43:36.293]  He has business partners with bin Laden and Saddam.
[00:43:38.411 --> 00:43:39.812]  I never thought you'd join the liberals.
[00:43:40.252 --> 00:44:05.030]  Yeah, I know that it's like, you know, the president is infallible, but real quick, and then I'll hang up here, this Taliban leader that just re-emerged, you know, that would be interesting to see if somehow there's a flight manifest for that flight where they flew all those Taliban leaders out into Pakistan, and I wonder exactly what his assigned walk-on role is here now.
[00:44:06.215 --> 00:44:09.898]  Well, for those that don't know, because I've said it so many times, I probably blabbered it out.
[00:44:09.918 --> 00:44:12.301]  It's like regurgitating a cliché.
[00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:19.167]  But tell them about the confirmed reports of now 8,000 Taliban and al-Qaeda flown out to safety by our government for doing their CIA job.
[00:44:19.207 --> 00:44:20.448]  Explain how that worked.
[00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:23.191]  And then explain why that's so serious.
[00:44:23.251 --> 00:44:25.153]  And all the publications it was in, if you remember.
[00:44:27.254 --> 00:44:27.455]  Me?
[00:44:28.015 --> 00:44:29.777]  Yeah, New Yorker Magazine, MSNBC.
[00:44:29.817 --> 00:44:31.859]  Yeah, it's been all over the news.
[00:44:32.653 --> 00:44:36.949]  And that basically pretty much all the Taliban leaders...
[00:44:37.577 --> 00:44:41.099]  We're flown out from Afghanistan into Pakistan.
[00:44:41.159 --> 00:44:44.001]  The so-called Arabs, remember, they would have them in rings.
[00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:50.746]  They would admit, well, there's 10-year-old kids and 95-year-old, literally, 85-year-old, somewhere 95 years old.
[00:44:51.286 --> 00:44:54.068]  These guys lived a long time in Afghanistan for some reason, I guess a clean living.
[00:44:54.548 --> 00:44:55.889]  But they would have ancient men.
[00:44:55.969 --> 00:44:57.390]  One of them was like 89, I remember.
[00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.711]  Most were like 15, 25.
[00:44:57.771 --> 00:44:59.071]  But young men out there in the front lines,
[00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:08.820]  And they, quote, you know, had the Arabs, the hardened Al-Qaeda Taliban pointing guns at them.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:12.123]  Well, those are the guys that went and loaded up on C-130s, U.S.
[00:45:12.163 --> 00:45:14.686]  troops, Pakistan intelligence, flew them out to safety.
[00:45:14.906 --> 00:45:15.947]  It was a CIA op.
[00:45:16.248 --> 00:45:18.070]  That's why all resistance imploded.
[00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:25.918]  The B-52s then bombed trenches with nobodies in it who'd been press ganged by Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:26.747 --> 00:45:28.609]  Hint, hint, CIA.
[00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:30.612]  And then Fox News had a report on it.
[00:45:30.632 --> 00:45:34.977]  I got it on my website, and they said, well, it was an accident that the CIA flew all these guys out.
[00:45:35.218 --> 00:45:36.940]  They accidentally loaded all the leaders in.
[00:45:37.361 --> 00:45:45.411]  But then it came out that one of our top Special Forces generals had this top Taliban general in his hands for two weeks through a fit.
[00:45:45.951 --> 00:45:53.214]  When the Pentagon ordered they release him and, quote, there was some monetary payment made when he drove out in his truck.
[00:45:53.614 --> 00:45:56.435]  Yeah, and I don't feel you can accidentally... Accidentally?
[00:45:56.455 --> 00:45:59.416]  Oh, here's some gold bars for you.
[00:45:59.657 --> 00:46:02.478]  I mean, military flights, they always have a flight manifest.
[00:46:02.578 --> 00:46:04.619]  I'm sure that one they probably made sure they didn't.
[00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:11.201]  But I don't feel you can accidentally fly... We just accidentally flew the entire leadership out, but don't worry.
[00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:13.122]  We're bombing little kids right now.
[00:46:13.926 --> 00:46:16.547]  Sitting there with their old Russian Kalashnikovs.
[00:46:16.967 --> 00:46:21.869]  You have to wonder what is... I mean, it's like they don't want the bogeyman to go away, you know?
[00:46:21.949 --> 00:46:23.710]  Oh, now Saddam's more like bin Laden.
[00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:25.251]  Tapes are emerging.
[00:46:25.951 --> 00:46:27.251]  I work with Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:28.252]  I'm bad.
[00:46:28.272 --> 00:46:33.294]  Oh, yes, this is exactly what the CIA needs to hear over and over again.
[00:46:33.694 --> 00:46:35.515]  Is Taliban guys just re-emerging?
[00:46:35.535 --> 00:46:36.495]  Oh, yeah.
[00:46:38.056 --> 00:46:40.837]  I tell you, all he's got to do is get into Mexico and then he can get into the U.S., and...
[00:46:42.279 --> 00:46:42.859]  Hey, don't worry.
[00:46:42.879 --> 00:46:44.340]  You're going to be good and enslaved.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:44.840]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.621]  Hey, real quick, what do you think about Halliburton?
[00:46:46.641 --> 00:46:51.404]  Yeah, I think that, I mean, talk about scoundrel time.
[00:46:51.564 --> 00:46:57.587]  What about Pearl in a big meeting hall going, these are the investments for the invasion of Iraq and North Korea, how you make money?
[00:46:57.607 --> 00:47:01.009]  I'm the top advisor in the Pentagon to the president.
[00:47:01.669 --> 00:47:08.633]  I will say Bush, I mean, Bush is Clinton on methamphetamines and steroids.
[00:47:08.673 --> 00:47:10.134]  You're so right, Alex.
[00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:10.374]  I mean...
[00:47:11.471 --> 00:47:15.573]  I mean, really, he makes Bill Clinton look like a saint, almost.
[00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:21.396]  I mean, some of the sort of stuff that he's been doing, like Halliburton, the way these contracts are ordered.
[00:47:21.416 --> 00:47:22.417]  This is why I'm scared.
[00:47:22.957 --> 00:47:25.999]  They're so confident the corruption is right out in the open.
[00:47:27.479 --> 00:47:33.682]  Bush came out today and said we're not releasing any 9-1-1 information, national security, from the last whitewash hearings.
[00:47:33.963 --> 00:47:35.103]  The stuff is so damaging.
[00:47:35.463 --> 00:47:39.465]  I mean, folks, if you haven't investigated 9-1-1, it is a total fairy tale.
[00:47:39.726 --> 00:47:40.446]  Thanks for the call, Mark.
[00:47:41.894 --> 00:47:42.974]  We'll come back and take more calls.
[00:47:42.994 --> 00:47:44.315]  We've got Dr. Dennis Cuddy coming on.
[00:47:44.375 --> 00:47:45.515]  I just got news overload.
[00:47:45.535 --> 00:47:47.416]  You've got to go to Infowars.com daily.
[00:47:47.796 --> 00:47:50.337]  And if this stuff doesn't make you freak out, there's something wrong with you.
[00:47:50.437 --> 00:47:51.717]  I mean, I've never seen anything like it.
[00:47:53.558 --> 00:48:01.600]  And I want to keep mentioning that not only is Bush going to reinstate the Clinton gun ban and magazine ban, with pleasure, by the way,
[00:48:04.196 --> 00:48:11.281]  They are also going to bring forward Our Lady of Peace Act that registers all gun owners, shuts down gun shows.
[00:48:11.862 --> 00:48:13.323]  Well, it's all the stuff in S-22.
[00:48:13.463 --> 00:48:20.428]  Our Lady of Peace is one bill in S-22, and there's the shut down the gun show section, National Ballistics Database.
[00:48:20.548 --> 00:48:24.451]  I mean, stuff that makes what Bill Clinton did look conservative.
[00:48:24.811 --> 00:48:28.033]  Folks, mayday, we're losing everything here!
[00:48:32.279 --> 00:48:39.663]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:48:39.923 --> 00:48:44.665]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:48:44.885 --> 00:48:50.528]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:48:50.768 --> 00:48:55.311]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:48:55.531 --> 00:49:02.676]  The cashless society control grid, impanable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:49:02.696 --> 00:49:07.239]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:49:07.399 --> 00:49:09.921]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:49:10.141 --> 00:49:16.846]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:36.810]  All right, folks.
[00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:39.891]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:51:39.931 --> 00:51:41.712]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:51:58.847 --> 00:52:02.968]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in New York, then Ed, Mike, Dave, and others.
[00:52:03.268 --> 00:52:04.008]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:52:04.028 --> 00:52:04.508]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:52:04.528 --> 00:52:05.388]  Hi, Alex.
[00:52:05.868 --> 00:52:09.889]  You know, it's funny that you mentioned the thing about people sharing in the power.
[00:52:09.969 --> 00:52:12.530]  I was thinking about that same issue three days ago.
[00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:13.610]  It popped into my head.
[00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:16.611]  And I said to myself, wait a minute.
[00:52:17.311 --> 00:52:20.851]  How is it benefiting the general population of this country?
[00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:26.033]  In other words, how are we sharing in any of the benefit of what's going on?
[00:52:27.093 --> 00:52:28.313]  I stopped and I looked around.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.836]  Gas prices are still about as high as they ever were.
[00:52:32.512 --> 00:52:35.334]  Nothing has changed, at least as it relates to John Q. Publix.
[00:52:35.374 --> 00:52:37.095]  And we're losing our liberty and freedom.
[00:52:37.155 --> 00:52:52.983]  I mean, if we had some war emperor who was totally reaffirming all our rights, leaving us alone, really taking out thugs, really giving them freedom, really trying to train with them, I'd say, well, this is a radical departure from what George Washington said, but it's not that bad.
[00:52:53.183 --> 00:53:01.988]  But when they're viciously attacking our freedom, setting up a police state, lying, murdering innocent people, blowing up all these countries, preparing for World War III, and arming the
[00:53:02.808 --> 00:53:10.492]  I don't see that it's having, at least up to this point, I have not seen that it's having any positive economic benefits for the common person.
[00:53:10.512 --> 00:53:12.934]  But it's a smokescreen subconsciously for people.
[00:53:13.294 --> 00:53:19.137]  And at the same time, all I'm seeing is a disabling and a diminution of our rights.
[00:53:19.397 --> 00:53:19.897]  That's true.
[00:53:20.317 --> 00:53:22.899]  Now, another strange thing happened about two days ago.
[00:53:23.659 --> 00:53:27.121]  As I heard a report, and the Federal Reserve, in fact,
[00:53:27.759 --> 00:53:31.685]  I said the economy's in even deeper trouble, yeah.
[00:53:44.362 --> 00:53:47.866]  Alan Greenspan had stated that he was concerned about high inflation.
[00:53:48.366 --> 00:53:56.214]  Now you've got low inflation, and the way they put it, the way they framed the argument was that, well, if inflation goes too low, you're going to lose jobs.
[00:53:56.294 --> 00:53:57.636]  Now, I don't see how that makes sense.
[00:53:58.256 --> 00:53:59.638]  If your money is worth more...
[00:54:00.333 --> 00:54:01.513]  Okay, and it buys more.
[00:54:01.973 --> 00:54:04.074]  You're going to buy more, which would create jobs.
[00:54:04.294 --> 00:54:06.414]  I'll tell you why they're against inflation.
[00:54:06.574 --> 00:54:08.115]  Let me finish.
[00:54:08.335 --> 00:54:09.395]  Let me finish.
[00:54:09.795 --> 00:54:14.316]  Inflation means that the money is not worth as much.
[00:54:14.336 --> 00:54:16.497]  Did you know the dollar just plunged massively?
[00:54:18.457 --> 00:54:23.738]  Well, it's upward inflation, but what they were talking about is a report that the inflation was going downward.
[00:54:24.158 --> 00:54:24.939]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:24.979 --> 00:54:26.299]  They want to hurt the dollar.
[00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:31.853]  But downward inflation means the money would have more value, if I understand that correctly.
[00:54:32.593 --> 00:54:40.616]  And if the money has more value, if the dollar in your pocket has more value, okay, I don't see, at least as it relates to the common person... Exactly.
[00:54:40.636 --> 00:54:42.036]  They want to kill the dollar.
[00:54:42.096 --> 00:54:46.918]  They said it three years ago, four years ago at Davos, three and a half years ago at Davos, Switzerland.
[00:54:47.258 --> 00:54:48.939]  They said it's time to kill the dollar.
[00:54:48.999 --> 00:54:49.459]  They said it.
[00:54:49.959 --> 00:54:50.719]  World leaders met.
[00:54:50.759 --> 00:54:52.960]  It's time to give the EU its time to shine.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.241]  Well, remember this.
[00:54:54.341 --> 00:54:55.521]  It's a real simple premise.
[00:54:56.101 --> 00:54:57.422]  If your dollar is worth more...
[00:54:57.904 --> 00:55:08.989]  That means that you could buy the things you need for your survival, your food, your mortgage, your rent, and you have something left over, and you might actually send your kid to college and compete with these elitists.
[00:55:09.369 --> 00:55:10.069]  They don't want that.
[00:55:10.109 --> 00:55:14.431]  They want you to constantly stay like a donkey pursuing a carrot, which you'll never get.
[00:55:14.451 --> 00:55:17.212]  Yeah, that's it, on the treadmill, so fast you can't even, you know.
[00:55:17.552 --> 00:55:24.055]  So if your money is worth more, that means you'll be able to take care of your necessities and have something left over to do something more.
[00:55:24.475 --> 00:55:26.836]  And I believe they don't want you to become...
[00:55:27.919 --> 00:55:29.299]  Strong economically.
[00:55:29.479 --> 00:55:30.940]  Well, they've said that.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:38.982]  I mean, they've got banking reports put up by the National Association of Banks back in the 1900s explaining how they like to scam people.
[00:55:39.022 --> 00:55:40.863]  This is a setup from the start.
[00:55:40.883 --> 00:55:42.743]  Thanks for the call, Ron.
[00:55:43.263 --> 00:55:44.043]  Really good points.
[00:55:44.184 --> 00:55:45.664]  The point I was trying to make is yes.
[00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:49.968]  They had always said they were against inflation.
[00:55:50.028 --> 00:55:51.529]  Now they want some more inflation.
[00:55:51.569 --> 00:55:54.670]  They're worried about de-inflation, deflation.
[00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:59.011]  And you look at the euro right now rising against the dollar.
[00:55:59.031 --> 00:55:59.912]  I've got the article right here.
[00:55:59.972 --> 00:56:02.793]  I mean, the biggest plunge ever in modern history.
[00:56:04.013 --> 00:56:06.694]  Why do they want to devalue the dollar further?
[00:56:08.194 --> 00:56:09.635]  They want to hurt your economy.
[00:56:10.436 --> 00:56:11.597]  They want to consolidate.
[00:56:11.617 --> 00:56:17.840]  That's why they mail 18-year-old kids a credit card every week, but if you've got a lot of money in the bank, you don't get them mailing you credit cards.
[00:56:18.361 --> 00:56:19.301]  They want you in debt.
[00:56:19.321 --> 00:56:19.962]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:21.623 --> 00:56:27.966]  By now, you've all heard about Prostate Wellness from OneSource Health Products, the natural product to help men maintain and improve their prostate health.
[00:56:28.206 --> 00:56:39.433]  Did you know each year over 400,000 men in the United States alone undergo... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.064 --> 00:56:47.704]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.365 --> 00:56:49.425]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.146 --> 00:56:51.247]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.907 --> 00:56:52.708]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.469 --> 00:56:54.369]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.389 --> 00:56:58.793]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.233 --> 00:57:03.297]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.325 --> 00:57:10.488]  Alright, my friends, we've got Dr. Dennis Cuddy, expert on the New World Order, author, joining us in the next segment.
[00:57:10.508 --> 00:57:11.309]  Let's go to the calls.
[00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:12.590]  Ed in Pennsylvania.
[00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:16.692]  Ed, you're on the air as America's freedoms are on fire.
[00:57:16.732 --> 00:57:17.173]  Go ahead.
[00:57:17.613 --> 00:57:18.013]  Hey, Alex.
[00:57:18.414 --> 00:57:18.894]  How you doing?
[00:57:19.374 --> 00:57:21.996]  I've got a law enforcement supply catalog here.
[00:57:22.876 --> 00:57:23.297]  A nice one.
[00:57:23.317 --> 00:57:26.259]  It has three different CIA patches in there.
[00:57:27.099 --> 00:57:29.521]  They've got an MKUltra one there.
[00:57:30.261 --> 00:57:32.342]  It's got their eagle head.
[00:57:33.083 --> 00:57:34.684]  Then it's got a big brain there.
[00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:38.111]  With a big syringe plunged into it.
[00:57:38.531 --> 00:57:40.092]  Yeah, psychological warfare.
[00:57:40.512 --> 00:57:41.452]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[00:57:41.472 --> 00:57:47.856]  And then the old OSS one, which was the original CIA, has three different snakes on there.
[00:57:48.576 --> 00:57:51.157]  The one that makes the O is a snake eating itself.
[00:57:51.978 --> 00:57:52.658]  The 2SS.
[00:57:53.318 --> 00:57:55.239]  And then it has the old CNI with the pyramid.
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:56.480]  That's pretty cool.
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:58.821]  Yeah, that's... The NI5 has that symbol, too.
[00:58:00.202 --> 00:58:02.743]  I'm going to order a couple of your tyranny response shirts.
[00:58:03.904 --> 00:58:03.984]  Um...
[00:58:05.417 --> 00:58:07.179]  I'd like you to send me a copy of that catalog.
[00:58:07.219 --> 00:58:09.020]  Last time I got sent a law enforcement catalog.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:09.701]  Shomer Tech.
[00:58:10.341 --> 00:58:17.968]  It goes, police officers use our units to nauseate protests and political speeches to stop the political process.
[00:58:18.128 --> 00:58:19.449]  Buy immediately.
[00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:26.775]  I've got this sonic ultra-low frequency weapon, and it says officers love disrupting political speeches with this.
[00:58:28.296 --> 00:58:32.019]  Don't be surprised if the speaker doesn't start vomiting immediately.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.901]  It's all part of the free country.
[00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:36.130]  I got that catalog.
[00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:37.511]  I mean, it actually says that, sir.
[00:58:37.852 --> 00:58:38.232]  Oh, I know.
[00:58:38.252 --> 00:58:39.153]  I've got that catalog.
[00:58:40.955 --> 00:58:43.458]  There's a DEA one here with skull and crossbones on it.
[00:58:43.558 --> 00:58:47.964]  There's a military police one with a skull wearing an MP helmet.
[00:58:48.785 --> 00:58:49.746]  Oh, so Christian.
[00:58:49.906 --> 00:58:51.768]  Kick, bleep, and take names, you know.
[00:58:51.788 --> 00:58:52.949]  And, uh...
[00:58:54.181 --> 00:58:59.244]  Yeah, what you got is Special Forces guys that never saw combat, and they're going to shake you and your wife down.
[00:58:59.284 --> 00:59:00.264]  I mean, this is the New Deal.
[00:59:00.565 --> 00:59:03.166]  We're fed upon, like in Planet of the Apes, we're running from them.
[00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:04.907]  They're running us down on the streets.
[00:59:05.527 --> 00:59:13.332]  Just for fun, I've been wearing this big CIA t-shirt some days, just to watch people's reactions.
[00:59:14.112 --> 00:59:17.414]  And I got one with a big KGB shirt I wear once in a while.
[00:59:18.522 --> 00:59:22.604]  Just to look into people's faces when they give you that kind of cross-eyed stare and stuff.
[00:59:22.644 --> 00:59:24.064]  You know, like, ooh, what's that, you know?
[00:59:25.345 --> 00:59:26.285]  I better not look at him.
[00:59:26.345 --> 00:59:28.286]  He'll get me because I'm in a free country.
[00:59:28.306 --> 00:59:29.607]  Thanks for the call, Ed.
[00:59:29.627 --> 00:59:30.147]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:59:30.407 --> 00:59:34.289]  Y'all hear folks go, well, the government's not corrupt, but you better watch talking like that.
[00:59:35.289 --> 00:59:36.970]  Oh, in a free country, I better watch talking like that?
[00:59:37.883 --> 00:59:38.863]  Michael in Illinois.
[00:59:38.883 --> 00:59:39.404]  You're on the air.
[00:59:39.484 --> 00:59:39.904]  Go ahead.
[00:59:40.024 --> 00:59:40.424]  Hey, Alex.
[00:59:40.464 --> 00:59:40.904]  How you doing?
[00:59:41.004 --> 00:59:41.424]  Pretty good, sir.
[00:59:41.464 --> 00:59:45.226]  Alex, I've been out of town for about two weeks, and I just got back yesterday.
[00:59:46.126 --> 00:59:54.089]  Are you aware of what's going on in Chicago and Seattle with this terrorist... They're going to have a mock terrorist attack?
[00:59:54.409 --> 00:59:55.909]  Yeah, they're going to have top-off, too.
[00:59:55.949 --> 01:00:03.132]  They had one in 99 where they practiced martial law and takeover and roundups into the sports stadiums, and that was in the Washington Post yesterday, yes.
[01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:07.956]  Yeah, so it's going to be here in Chicago, and a friend of mine lives in the city itself.
[01:00:08.036 --> 01:00:13.685]  I live in the suburbs, but he told me they've got a bunch of roads already barricaded off where they're going to prepare to do this thing.
[01:00:14.201 --> 01:00:16.902]  And they're bringing in the guys in military suits and all that stuff.
[01:00:17.042 --> 01:00:21.843]  All part of training you and to get the local police integrated into federal control.
[01:00:22.344 --> 01:00:24.244]  And they have a bill to federalize every city.
[01:00:24.524 --> 01:00:26.465]  New Orleans already fell to total federal control.
[01:00:26.805 --> 01:00:28.326]  I hope you'll go get some video with that.
[01:00:28.346 --> 01:00:29.266]  I hope folks will do that.
[01:00:29.306 --> 01:00:30.486]  Yeah, Alex, I'm going to do that.
[01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:33.627]  I'm going to actually go there with my video camera and then I'll send you the tape.
[01:00:34.027 --> 01:00:35.308]  Oh, I love you to death.
[01:00:35.348 --> 01:00:36.368]  Let me ask you a question, Alex.
[01:00:37.288 --> 01:00:38.889]  I'm real surprised, you know, when...
[01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:43.456]  When the Iraqi conflict was supposedly over, that the U.S.
[01:00:43.476 --> 01:00:49.686]  didn't plant, or maybe they will, they haven't done it yet, but they haven't planted some fake biochemical weapon.
[01:00:49.706 --> 01:00:52.411]  Let me explain the psychology, Mike, and you're making good points.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:56.142]  If they would have done that day one, people were already saying they were going to plan it.
[01:00:56.202 --> 01:01:00.325]  But if they come up short dozens of times and go, okay, I guess we won't.
[01:01:00.405 --> 01:01:01.126]  We were wrong.
[01:01:01.426 --> 01:01:03.928]  There'll be a big, ooh, that's a blow.
[01:01:04.348 --> 01:01:06.110]  Approval ratings drop by ten points.
[01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:10.813]  And then a month later, some innocent news agency, they're going to find it.
[01:01:11.314 --> 01:01:12.134]  Masses of it.
[01:01:12.174 --> 01:01:13.115]  And, oh, they were right.
[01:01:13.515 --> 01:01:14.996]  Now his approval rating's higher than ever.
[01:01:15.016 --> 01:01:16.217]  Don't ever question them.
[01:01:16.457 --> 01:01:17.658]  You understand the psychology?
[01:01:17.918 --> 01:01:18.499]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:01:18.539 --> 01:01:19.039]  Thanks a lot.
[01:01:19.059 --> 01:01:19.900]  You're doing a great job.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:20.781]  Anything else, Mike?
[01:01:20.961 --> 01:01:21.961]  No, Alex, that's about it.
[01:01:22.021 --> 01:01:22.302]  I just...
[01:01:22.882 --> 01:01:24.583]  Keep up the good work, and we've got to fight the New World.
[01:01:24.623 --> 01:01:26.925]  I'm going to get out there with the videotape, and I will send you a copy.
[01:01:27.345 --> 01:01:27.886]  Absolutely.
[01:01:27.906 --> 01:01:30.868]  Yeah, we went to a little mini top-off exercises here in Central Texas.
[01:01:31.308 --> 01:01:34.891]  Crips will walk up and go, what are you doing with the camera on me, boy?
[01:01:36.612 --> 01:01:38.293]  And we say, well, it's America, sir.
[01:01:38.313 --> 01:01:40.135]  We're trying to uncover news here.
[01:01:43.277 --> 01:01:46.379]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:48.621]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.160]  We're good.
[01:02:08.473 --> 01:02:09.214]  Call today.
[01:02:09.234 --> 01:02:09.294]  877-605-9200.
[01:02:09.394 --> 01:02:10.094]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:02:10.194 --> 01:02:10.555]  Call today.
[01:02:42.719 --> 01:02:50.102]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:50.382 --> 01:02:55.104]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.344 --> 01:03:00.986]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.226 --> 01:03:01.947]  We're good to go.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:18.280]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:41.676 --> 01:03:45.339]  How many of you listening would give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:46.701]  Listen up, folks.
[01:03:46.841 --> 01:03:50.224]  If you're taking vitamins in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[01:03:50.624 --> 01:03:56.009]  You see, according to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are just 10% absorbed.
[01:03:56.349 --> 01:04:00.973]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, you're literally flushing $90 down the toilet.
[01:04:02.214 --> 01:04:08.459]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, and if you want to start absorbing the nutrients that you swallow, you need to take sea silver.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:17.727]  Not only does it contain every vitamin, mineral, amino acid, and enzyme known to man, but because it's in an organic liquid form, it offers a 98% absorption.
[01:04:18.047 --> 01:04:21.250]  And what that means is your body gets to keep the nutrients that you swallow.
[01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:23.632]  Try delicious tasting sea silver today.
[01:04:24.052 --> 01:04:26.534]  You'll feel a difference in two weeks or your money back.
[01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:27.195]  Call 1-888-887-2063.
[01:04:31.158 --> 01:04:31.519]  1-888-887-2063.
[01:04:31.699 --> 01:04:41.088]  Isn't it time you stopped flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[01:04:41.108 --> 01:04:42.009]  1-888-887-2063.
[01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:49.876]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:50.477 --> 01:04:53.460]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:58.015 --> 01:05:00.136]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:05:00.156 --> 01:05:06.560]  until 2 p.m., I do this show live, Central Standard Time, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[01:05:07.161 --> 01:05:12.624]  And, of course, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time for the rebroadcast of the daytime show from 1 a.m.
[01:05:13.325 --> 01:05:14.365]  until 4 p.m.
[01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:22.018]  AM, the websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:05:22.058 --> 01:05:32.124]  And incidentally, I've only slept about, I don't know, nine hours the last three days because I have finally completed, I'm very excited, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:32.584 --> 01:05:37.708]  It's over two and a half hours long, and it's the third installment in the Police State series.
[01:05:37.728 --> 01:05:43.131]  So you can go to Infowars.com or net to learn more about that, or I'll give you the number later to get it.
[01:05:43.883 --> 01:05:44.724]  I think we're good to go.
[01:06:01.354 --> 01:06:03.255]  Push for New World Order.
[01:06:03.355 --> 01:06:07.558]  The Prince of Darkness, Pearl, has said they're going to invade North Korea.
[01:06:08.018 --> 01:06:16.463]  They have purposely leaked the invasion plan to probably try to get the psychotic demon who lives in a seven-story pleasure palace.
[01:06:17.064 --> 01:06:18.204]  And this guy is crazy, folks.
[01:06:18.244 --> 01:06:19.765]  He kidnaps Asian film stars.
[01:06:19.825 --> 01:06:21.006]  I mean, he's nuts.
[01:06:22.063 --> 01:06:24.604]  Kim Jong-il, probably trying to get them to go ahead and attack us.
[01:06:24.624 --> 01:06:27.985]  We know they've shot a test missile at Alaska a few years ago.
[01:06:28.025 --> 01:06:28.765]  That was covered up.
[01:06:29.045 --> 01:06:31.626]  How do you invade Iraq when North Korea's hitting us with test missiles?
[01:06:32.166 --> 01:06:36.847]  Pearl's now been giving speeches to investors saying, yeah, here's how you make money off these wars.
[01:06:37.268 --> 01:06:41.749]  Now Halliburton, oh, turns out it's going to run the oil pipelines and systems.
[01:06:42.389 --> 01:06:44.150]  Big surprise, no bids allowed.
[01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:48.711]  New levels of corruption as we lose our liberties here domestically, and we're joined...
[01:06:49.725 --> 01:06:51.566]  By an expert on the New World Order.
[01:06:51.606 --> 01:06:56.468]  I've read several of his books, and for some reason we haven't hooked up over all these years, but it's good to have him on.
[01:06:56.508 --> 01:07:01.170]  Dennis Lawrence Cuddy, historian and political analyst, received a Ph.D.
[01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:06.613]  from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, major in American history, minor in political science.
[01:07:06.653 --> 01:07:15.416]  Dr. Cuddy has taught university level, has been a political and economic risk analysis analyst for an international consulting firm, has been a senior associate with the U.S.
[01:07:15.456 --> 01:07:16.477]  Department of Education.
[01:07:17.017 --> 01:07:21.440]  He's also testified before members of Congress on behalf of the U.S.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:22.301]  Department of Justice.
[01:07:22.321 --> 01:07:32.847]  Dr. Cuddy has authored or edited 17 books and booklets and has written hundreds of articles appearing in newspapers around the nation, including the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, USA Today.
[01:07:32.907 --> 01:07:37.690]  He has been a guest on numerous radio talk shows, and now he's here with us, and he really digs out.
[01:07:38.011 --> 01:07:42.694]  I like his books because, you know, he doesn't say they plan to dumb us down and enslave us
[01:07:43.354 --> 01:07:44.735]  Thanks for having me.
[01:07:44.755 --> 01:07:45.656]  What is the New World Order?
[01:08:07.697 --> 01:08:13.521]  Well, the New World Order is a concept that goes back many years.
[01:08:14.502 --> 01:08:20.607]  When George Herbert Walker Bush used it, everybody thought it was something of a new term, but H.G.
[01:08:20.647 --> 01:08:22.428]  Wells, the famous author,
[01:08:23.154 --> 01:08:26.735]  I had a book by that name back in 1939.
[01:08:27.756 --> 01:08:30.537]  Even earlier than that, you find books by that title.
[01:08:30.717 --> 01:08:33.718]  By the way, folks can download that for free at prisonplanet.com.
[01:08:33.758 --> 01:08:35.899]  It's online, where they call for the world government.
[01:08:36.239 --> 01:08:37.500]  Adolf Hitler called for it.
[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:38.980]  Joseph Stalin called for it.
[01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:40.881]  All these guys called for it.
[01:08:42.488 --> 01:08:43.309]  That's correct.
[01:08:43.949 --> 01:08:45.450]  The plan goes back many years.
[01:08:45.570 --> 01:08:47.451]  There's several branches to it.
[01:08:48.032 --> 01:08:56.096]  On the one hand, you have Cecil Rhodes' plan to take over, as he said, to take the government of the whole world using Rhodes Scholars like Bill Clinton and others.
[01:08:56.877 --> 01:09:00.519]  There's another avenue of it that goes through the Fabian Socialists.
[01:09:00.579 --> 01:09:01.920]  Now they're called the Third Way.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.642]  There's another branch of it, Skull and Bones.
[01:09:04.782 --> 01:09:06.743]  This is the Bushes and some other...
[01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:16.474]  ...individuals, but they're all moving in what Wells called, and I'll get to how that applies right now, to a synthesis.
[01:09:16.514 --> 01:09:22.418]  What they're doing is they're trying to synthesize eastern communism and western capitalism into a world socialist government.
[01:09:23.058 --> 01:09:32.724]  And in terms of how that plays out with this current escapade in Iraq, the thesis is that the UN should direct everything under UN resolutions.
[01:09:32.784 --> 01:09:33.744]  You should do what they say.
[01:09:33.764 --> 01:09:35.045]  The antithesis is...
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:42.150]  That the Anglo-American Alliance that Cecil Rhodes planned to run everything would be the dominant force.
[01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:49.541]  And the synthesis is that you combine the Anglo-American Alliance with about 49 other nations but nowhere near a majority of the U.N.,
[01:09:50.074 --> 01:09:51.255]  And so that's what's happened.
[01:09:51.275 --> 01:09:54.497]  It's a dialectic that constantly goes on over the years.
[01:09:54.517 --> 01:09:57.800]  Wow, we need to have you on more often because no one seems to get this.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:00.021]  About four years ago, I started seeing policy reports.
[01:10:00.502 --> 01:10:02.523]  They couldn't deny that there was a new world order anymore.
[01:10:02.543 --> 01:10:04.985]  You know, you were crazy before to talk about it as the president said it.
[01:10:05.265 --> 01:10:08.768]  Now they've read their own reports and policy papers, their own white papers.
[01:10:09.228 --> 01:10:12.070]  So I started seeing the left say, okay, there is a world government.
[01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:14.191]  Will the left control it, or will the right?
[01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:18.694]  So going back to the left-right paradigm, the false system, what we're going to have is the U.N.
[01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:25.739]  playing the part of the good cop, America kind of as the new Soviet Union, chewing up, grabbing the countries up.
[01:10:26.099 --> 01:10:29.160]  Getting them under globalist control when the same bankers own it all.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:33.442]  Own the UN, own the Anglo-American establishment that Quigley talked about.
[01:10:33.642 --> 01:10:39.864]  But they need to create the illusion globally that there's a choice inside this new world order making the UN play the part of the good guy.
[01:10:40.944 --> 01:10:41.384]  That's right.
[01:10:41.484 --> 01:10:47.426]  And when you mention the bankers, and as I appreciate your mentioning, I let the people speak for themselves.
[01:10:47.707 --> 01:10:51.788]  I try and put these documents, letters signed by Churchill or Roosevelt, and one
[01:10:52.250 --> 01:11:05.940]  The letter that I include in the book The Globalist is FDR writing to Colonel House, Woodrow Wilson's chief advisor, saying the real truth of the matter is you and I know that the financial element in our larger centers has owned our government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.861]  So you're right on that.
[01:11:07.881 --> 01:11:13.065]  Well, old House, he lived right down the road from me here in Austin.
[01:11:14.086 --> 01:11:21.231]  Yeah, his grandfather just happened to be one of the very few people that came out of the Civil War making a lot of money.
[01:11:22.942 --> 01:11:25.504]  And of course, that was manipulated by the British on both sides.
[01:11:25.524 --> 01:11:27.405]  So how do we stop the New World Order?
[01:11:27.765 --> 01:11:32.447]  How do we educate the left and the right that they're really just part of a phony system?
[01:11:33.128 --> 01:11:40.332]  Well, the first thing, you have to crack through their predisposition to think you're a nut if you talk about conspiracy theories.
[01:11:40.352 --> 01:11:44.194]  And the best way to do that is, the way I do it is I set them up.
[01:11:44.654 --> 01:11:53.340]  By saying, suppose I told you there was a power somewhere so complete, so pervasive, so interlocked, so watchful, you better not speak above your breath if you speak in condemnation of it.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:57.122]  After they get finished laughing in my face for a while, I say, well, I didn't say that.
[01:11:57.202 --> 01:11:59.444]  One of your heroes, Woodrow Wilson, said that.
[01:11:59.964 --> 01:12:01.125]  Now you've got their attention.
[01:12:01.644 --> 01:12:16.208]  And so you bring them up to today and explain how this is happening, how through, let's say, Tavistock, British intelligence and so forth, they had developed a theory, for example, called the theory of social turbulence, where through...
[01:12:17.091 --> 01:12:22.816]  A number of crises, emotional crises, that cause people to go into psychological retreat.
[01:12:22.876 --> 01:12:24.357]  You get turned off of things.
[01:12:24.377 --> 01:12:29.121]  They found that if you agitate a colony of rats long enough, they kind of submit and become docile.
[01:12:29.201 --> 01:12:29.642]  That's right.
[01:12:29.842 --> 01:12:30.262]  That's right.
[01:12:30.382 --> 01:12:32.524]  And so this is very scientific.
[01:12:32.644 --> 01:12:43.233]  Way, way back, Edward Bernays, the father of public opinion, said we, in effect, he was writing this in 1928 when he became the chief advisor to CBS's William Paley.
[01:12:43.755 --> 01:12:47.057]  He wrote a book, Propaganda, where he says we're like a government.
[01:12:47.157 --> 01:12:49.318]  We know how to manipulate you, and that's what we're going to do.
[01:12:50.758 --> 01:12:54.520]  And now they're getting rid of all pretense that they're fair and balanced.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.020]  It is.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:00.423]  Now they've removed the left-right debate, and it's just, oh, we're this big imperial army.
[01:13:00.823 --> 01:13:05.725]  We're now seeing the war emperor with his troops every day in military outfits.
[01:13:06.185 --> 01:13:09.987]  They're following the old patterns, as you said, with the overlay of technology technology.
[01:13:11.401 --> 01:13:11.822]  That's right.
[01:13:11.862 --> 01:13:17.705]  It's what I've called the techno-feudal, F-E-U-D-A-L, society of the future.
[01:13:17.906 --> 01:13:22.869]  And that was 100 years ago in a book called Our Benevolent Feudalism, where they mapped this out.
[01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:28.913]  Yeah, I guess I just spontaneously came up with my own term without reading that.
[01:13:29.033 --> 01:13:29.953]  Neo-feudalism.
[01:13:30.994 --> 01:13:31.194]  Sure.
[01:13:31.214 --> 01:13:32.495]  Yeah, it is that.
[01:13:34.056 --> 01:13:34.857]  What is feudalism?
[01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:39.760]  Because before 100 years ago, Dr. Cuddy, people knew that it was two types of governments...
[01:13:40.493 --> 01:13:48.398]  All the different varieties of tyranny on one side and liberty on the other, and it was always looked at according to freedom, at least in this country in the experiment here.
[01:13:48.798 --> 01:13:56.603]  Now it's shifted to that left-right debate where people can't even get to real discussions because, again, we're always caught up in the two phony choices.
[01:13:58.144 --> 01:14:00.865]  Right, and two things.
[01:14:01.346 --> 01:14:07.409]  First of all, politically, that was planned by the Skull and Bones Whitney's in the late 1800s where they...
[01:14:09.096 --> 01:14:22.641]  They mapped out a plan whereby they would contribute to both Democrat and Republican left and right, and then they would deliberately alternate power among these politicians so that the stupid public would think they have a choice, but they didn't.
[01:14:22.861 --> 01:14:27.403]  And it also adds, as you say in one of your books, that they like to use competition.
[01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:28.443]  Oh, yeah.
[01:14:28.483 --> 01:14:36.646]  The agenda moves forward, but for the henchmen to get top positions, whoever can drive and manipulate the best gets the CEO job of Slavery Incorporated.
[01:14:37.793 --> 01:14:39.994]  Yeah, and there's various avenues.
[01:14:40.054 --> 01:14:48.958]  You have the Cecil Rhodes Avenue where they would, he said, penetrate journalism, economics, education, and politics and get their key people into certain places.
[01:14:48.978 --> 01:14:49.918]  Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:14:50.818 --> 01:14:52.039]  That was an outgrowth, right.
[01:14:52.079 --> 01:14:56.061]  The CFR was an outgrowth along with the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[01:14:56.641 --> 01:15:04.524]  And Colonel House, he mentioned earlier, said if the First World War had not come in fierce and exaggerated form, they would not have been able to get that.
[01:15:05.526 --> 01:15:06.926]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:15:06.966 --> 01:15:11.428]  That's another example of what you can throw into people's faces who are skeptics.
[01:15:11.628 --> 01:15:15.209]  Because whenever you say the CFR, their eyes start to roll around and so on.
[01:15:15.869 --> 01:15:20.650]  So what I do is I say, okay, look, Bill Clinton, you're a liberal, let's say I'm talking to.
[01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.850]  You're a liberal.
[01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:22.750]  Do you like Bill Clinton?
[01:15:22.891 --> 01:15:23.251]  Oh, yes.
[01:15:23.331 --> 01:15:28.652]  Well, his mentor, Carol Quigley at Georgetown, looked at the, quote, secret records of this power elite.
[01:15:29.071 --> 01:15:34.555]  And in his book, Tragedy and Hope, he said that these people, the CFR, is a front group for these people.
[01:15:34.995 --> 01:15:36.096]  Now, they may be skeptical.
[01:15:36.136 --> 01:15:37.477]  I say, okay, listen to this.
[01:15:37.737 --> 01:15:45.382]  Arthur Schlesinger, the year before that book, in a thousand days, his book in 1965, and he's a member of the CFR, said the same thing.
[01:15:45.462 --> 01:15:46.503]  It's a front group.
[01:15:46.543 --> 01:15:48.785]  The CFR is a front group for this power elite.
[01:15:49.785 --> 01:15:50.846]  Well, that's the incredible thing.
[01:15:50.886 --> 01:15:54.669]  Their own publication, Foreign Affairs, says they're going to enslave us, going to dumb us down.
[01:15:55.367 --> 01:16:00.991]  They're saying it, and then you read it, and a cop on the street will say, Alex, we were given a briefing.
[01:16:01.271 --> 01:16:02.952]  We know that's code for terror.
[01:16:03.753 --> 01:16:06.055]  I go, sir, CFR's on TV now.
[01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.696]  Uh-uh, they don't exist.
[01:16:08.116 --> 01:16:09.177]  How do they brainwash them?
[01:16:09.397 --> 01:16:15.601]  How do the FBI training manuals, Dr. Cuddy, say that those that say there's a new world order are potential terrorists, that it doesn't exist?
[01:16:15.902 --> 01:16:19.644]  How do they have presidents announcing it, but then double-think saying it doesn't exist?
[01:16:20.185 --> 01:16:20.545]  That's right.
[01:16:21.531 --> 01:16:23.272]  I hear the music, but I guess we're going to break.
[01:16:23.292 --> 01:16:24.834]  Yes, we'll get the answer from Dr. Cuddy.
[01:16:25.034 --> 01:16:25.854]  Great to talk to him.
[01:16:25.894 --> 01:16:27.355]  We'll talk about some of his great books.
[01:16:27.435 --> 01:16:28.856]  I've read, I don't know, three or four of them.
[01:16:28.896 --> 01:16:30.297]  He's written 17.
[01:16:31.178 --> 01:16:34.220]  It's all coming up, and we'll tell you about some of the websites and newspapers he writes for.
[01:16:34.641 --> 01:16:35.381]  Al will open the phones.
[01:16:35.401 --> 01:16:38.183]  I hope he can stay with us into the next hour or two so we have plenty of time to take calls.
[01:16:38.644 --> 01:16:41.285]  I've got a bunch of current news and events I want to mention to him.
[01:16:43.027 --> 01:16:46.069]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[01:16:46.593 --> 01:16:48.614]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[01:16:48.955 --> 01:16:51.577]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.

[01:17:05.226 --> 01:17:11.771]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.

[01:17:15.794 --> 01:17:19.237]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[01:17:19.657 --> 01:17:21.939]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[01:17:22.299 --> 01:17:23.140]  Do it now.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:32.747]  That's $10 collector gold coins, $10 and $20 collector gold coins, at the nearest of melt in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.

[01:20:46.576 --> 01:20:48.096]  This show is documented.
[01:20:48.617 --> 01:20:51.358]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:51.778 --> 01:20:55.340]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:59.822]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:21:00.382 --> 01:21:01.263]  All right, my friends.
[01:21:01.283 --> 01:21:02.904]  Talking to Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[01:21:05.085 --> 01:21:06.566]  Worked in and out of the federal government.
[01:21:07.266 --> 01:21:08.807]  Written a whole bunch of books.
[01:21:08.887 --> 01:21:09.747]  Really insightful.
[01:21:09.787 --> 01:21:11.248]  Understands the paradigm we're facing.
[01:21:11.963 --> 01:21:12.883]  Neocons.
[01:21:13.143 --> 01:21:18.364]  A lot of them, these talk show hosts, are admitted beatniks, communists, turned conservative.
[01:21:18.404 --> 01:21:22.485]  A lot of the neocon leaders, daddies and mommies, were leading Marxists.
[01:21:22.985 --> 01:21:30.066]  Then they're hooked up with a weird eastern establishment blue blood clan who hail from a place called the tomb, Skull and Bones.
[01:21:30.666 --> 01:21:34.447]  I mean, we're talking about a collection of maniacs, but they know what they're doing.
[01:21:35.427 --> 01:21:41.088]  I think it's obvious, Dr. Cuddy, they're really moving in on one of the big steps in their final phase, aren't they?
[01:21:42.327 --> 01:21:48.372]  Yeah, and there's, believe it or not, some time ago in Austin, Texas, a connection to all this.
[01:21:48.812 --> 01:21:52.675]  I'll just do this really quick since you brought this up.
[01:21:53.856 --> 01:21:58.800]  William Crystal is editor of the Weekly Standard magazine.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.283]  Murdoch propaganda arm just called for New World Order yesterday.
[01:22:02.843 --> 01:22:03.263]  That's right.
[01:22:03.924 --> 01:22:10.429]  And in fact, I'll digress just a minute because you were talking about how can these people say there's no New World Order.
[01:22:11.882 --> 01:22:28.461]  Usually, if you look at the CFRS Journal of Foreign Affairs, for example, in April of last year, what you had was President Bush was not really, I mean, he had already called Iraq and North Korea and
[01:22:29.051 --> 01:22:30.172]  Iran, Axis of Evil.
[01:22:30.212 --> 01:22:35.774]  But he was dilly-dallying until the CFR's Foreign Affairs came out with an article saying, Next stop, Baghdad.
[01:22:35.914 --> 01:22:40.076]  Then he walks into Condoleezza Rice's office and says, What are we going to do about Saddam?
[01:22:40.696 --> 01:22:41.316]  Same thing now.
[01:22:41.336 --> 01:22:50.000]  If you look at the May-June issue just come out of the CFR's Foreign Affairs, there's an article there by Michael Glennon.
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:50.940]  I think his name is.
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:57.963]  It's specifically using that term that what we have to build here is a new world order through ad hoc coalitions of the willing.
[01:22:58.624 --> 01:23:02.687]  And so, once again, they're using the terms and they're mapping out the future.
[01:23:03.468 --> 01:23:10.253]  But in terms of William Crystal, let me give you, this will take 30 seconds or so, but it's interesting.
[01:23:11.013 --> 01:23:24.563]  William Crystal is the head of the Project for the New American Century, which had mapped out a lot of what happened regarding Iraq and the removal of Saddam and threatening his written letters.
[01:23:24.703 --> 01:23:25.264]  They have
[01:23:25.708 --> 01:23:28.270]  By the way, Bennett's off running around with $1.4 million gambling debts.
[01:23:28.290 --> 01:23:29.832]  William Crystal...
[01:23:50.786 --> 01:23:57.830]  Is where he is now, I believe, as you said, their daddies have something to do with this, because of a plan.
[01:23:57.850 --> 01:24:00.751]  I'll try to be brief about this.
[01:24:01.511 --> 01:24:14.377]  Many, many years ago, William Bennett, when he was a young fellow, hooked up with William Sloan Coffin, the radical preacher back during the Vietnam War days, who was also a member of Skull and Bones and the CIA as well.
[01:24:15.103 --> 01:24:23.307]  And they were friends, and Sloan Coffin and some others at Williams College, where he was attending, said, why don't you go down to Austin, Texas?
[01:24:24.327 --> 01:24:34.351]  And there, hook up with a, I forget, it begins with a K, it's a philosophy professor, where Bennett wrote a dissertation, which was read a strange and very short dissertation.
[01:24:35.212 --> 01:24:40.474]  And at the first of it, he says something to the effect, gentlemen even keep their promises even in hell.
[01:24:41.027 --> 01:24:42.910]  And this was sort of his dedication.
[01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:45.393]  And he gets out of there very quickly.
[01:24:45.934 --> 01:24:56.029]  In fact, he is attending Harvard Law School the first year of Harvard Law while he's still working on his dissertation, which told me his path was being greased at that time.
[01:24:56.883 --> 01:25:02.788]  He had hooked up with Irving Kristol's commentary magazine, and they were giving him publicity through book reviews.
[01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:15.178]  The next thing you know, Charles Frankel, who was on the editorial board of the Humanist magazine, gets Bennett to be his assistant at the National Humanities Center near where I live here, just a few miles away.
[01:25:15.198 --> 01:25:20.602]  Folks that don't know, these guys, and it's admitted in the mainstream news, all come from communist, Marxist, socialist bent.
[01:25:21.527 --> 01:25:41.454]  Yeah, the neocons, the Irving Crystals, his wife, Gertrude Hemmelfarb, their partners, Norman Podhoretz and Mitch Dechter, who even in the 90s was the vice president of the League for Industrial Democracy, formerly titled the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, were old Trotskyites or whatever.
[01:25:41.834 --> 01:25:45.755]  And Bush calls himself a communitarian.
[01:25:45.775 --> 01:25:48.076]  Well, that definition, one who promotes communist systems.
[01:25:48.712 --> 01:25:53.353]  Yeah, if you look at Amitai Etzioni and the leaders of this, there's another one named Law.
[01:25:53.393 --> 01:25:54.373]  I want to stop you again.
[01:25:54.633 --> 01:25:59.534]  They're publicly saying New World Order, World Empire, then when we say it, it doesn't exist, we're insane.
[01:25:59.834 --> 01:26:05.535]  They publicly say we are communists, we are communitarians, and we point it out, people go, how crazy!
[01:26:05.555 --> 01:26:07.576]  I mean, how do they get away with that?
[01:26:07.956 --> 01:26:12.877]  Well, right now, if you ask them, they would not say we are communists.
[01:26:12.977 --> 01:26:13.977]  They'll say something else.
[01:26:14.097 --> 01:26:17.378]  But they flow from the old Trotskyite days, years ago.
[01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:21.482]  And so what happened is... Do I hear the music?
[01:26:21.642 --> 01:26:23.864]  Yeah, we've got a few seconds left, but just stay there, Dr. Cuddy.
[01:26:23.904 --> 01:26:26.867]  I want to get into 9-1-1 with you, the book you've written.
[01:26:26.887 --> 01:26:29.430]  I want to talk about the globalist plan how to stop a man to take calls.
[01:26:29.670 --> 01:26:30.111]  Stay right there.
[01:26:30.131 --> 01:26:30.812]  We're honored to have you.
[01:26:32.874 --> 01:26:33.795]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.255 --> 01:26:35.857]  The empire's on the run.

[01:27:10.885 --> 01:27:13.266]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:27:13.286 --> 01:27:21.332]  Folks, I'm going to tell you the truth.
[01:27:21.652 --> 01:27:24.694]  Our families' futures, our very lives, hang in the balance.
[01:27:24.714 --> 01:27:27.016]  I have read globalist policy reports.
[01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:29.137]  I like to go to the Army War College.
[01:27:30.158 --> 01:27:31.859]  I have found a lot of what they're really going to do
[01:27:33.012 --> 01:27:35.212]  With the actual hardware of the police state.
[01:27:35.232 --> 01:27:42.694]  I mean, I read an Army War College report from 68, where they said that by 2000 they wanted inkless fingerprint readers to buy and sell.
[01:27:44.314 --> 01:27:54.576]  I read British Army psychological warfare manuals written in the 40s, and everything they talk about is being used on the nightly news, but with more sophistication.
[01:27:54.616 --> 01:27:56.076]  Now, Dr. Cuddy has a Ph.D.
[01:27:56.116 --> 01:28:01.117]  in this, has worked with the federal government, and comes highly recommended by Charlotte Iserby and others that we've had on.
[01:28:02.126 --> 01:28:13.114]  When you read their plan to turn your kid into a crackhead, when you read their plan to make our economy a prison state, when you read the plan, and Dr. Cuddy isn't a great example of this.
[01:28:13.214 --> 01:28:20.479]  Bush wants to reaffirm the Clinton gun ban and magazine ban and wants more gun control and the neocon.
[01:28:21.681 --> 01:28:22.202]  Yeah, they...
[01:28:44.918 --> 01:28:45.439]  Thank you.
[01:28:45.459 --> 01:28:45.799]  Thank you.
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:01.801]  You could, quote, kick the rascals out, but not really change anything.
[01:29:01.861 --> 01:29:12.363]  That's why, even though you have Clinton supposedly different from the Bushes, they all support NAFTA and GATT, World Trade Organization, most favored nation status for China, and so on.
[01:29:12.963 --> 01:29:16.224]  Gun-grabbing, open borders, supercomputers to communist China.
[01:29:16.544 --> 01:29:18.464]  Clinton gave some of the computers to China.
[01:29:18.484 --> 01:29:19.944]  He was evil and bad, and yes, he was.
[01:29:20.285 --> 01:29:24.345]  Then Bush takes all restrictions off, and I heard Limbaugh go, ah, so what?
[01:29:25.526 --> 01:29:27.146]  Yeah, the president of
[01:29:27.714 --> 01:29:37.282]  The first President Bush's brother, while they were saying how horrible Tiananmen Square was, was over there making a satellite communications deal with those people while playing a bit of golf.
[01:29:37.983 --> 01:29:48.151]  And now I think one of them is trying to get in on, or it's Neil, I guess it's Neil Bush, trying to get in on the Education Act over in Iraq with perhaps William Bennett as well.
[01:29:48.191 --> 01:29:50.673]  They may have something going themselves.
[01:29:50.753 --> 01:29:52.935]  But the plan, as you asked,
[01:29:53.453 --> 01:29:54.294]  Hey, wait a minute.
[01:29:54.334 --> 01:29:55.635]  Bennett needs some money, man.
[01:29:55.675 --> 01:30:03.460]  When you drop $1.4 million in a weekend, you've got to, you know, at the tracker at Atlantic City, you need some cash.
[01:30:04.341 --> 01:30:21.594]  Well, yeah, but see, when you have a book like the Book of Virtues, which all these, as you said, the conservatives and Christians love, that includes a lot of Greek gods and goddesses, Castor and Pollux, when it's Yiddish Thera at Heaven's Gate, where a little Yiddish Thera
[01:30:22.142 --> 01:30:24.783]  But Dr. Cuddy, isn't Skull and Bones a premier Christian organization?
[01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.431]  A what?
[01:30:51.871 --> 01:30:53.872]  Well, I mean, people say he's a born-again Christian.
[01:30:53.892 --> 01:30:54.792]  Don't talk bad about him.
[01:30:54.852 --> 01:30:55.613]  Oh, yeah.
[01:30:56.333 --> 01:30:57.614]  I mean, is it skull and bones then?
[01:30:57.714 --> 01:30:59.675]  Is it the order of death and Satan loving?
[01:31:01.536 --> 01:31:03.417]  Not really.
[01:31:04.017 --> 01:31:10.440]  They hook up through various mechanisms with the Illuminati and other groups.
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:11.241]  You know what?
[01:31:11.281 --> 01:31:12.461]  I'm jumping all over, and I apologize.
[01:31:12.481 --> 01:31:13.842]  I'm going to try to shut up here in a minute.
[01:31:13.862 --> 01:31:15.123]  Let me bring this forward.
[01:31:15.183 --> 01:31:17.044]  Are you aware that I snuck into Bohemian Grove?
[01:31:17.544 --> 01:31:17.884]  Yes, sir.
[01:31:17.924 --> 01:31:18.785]  I've seen the video.
[01:31:18.845 --> 01:31:19.245]  Very good.
[01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:21.570]  Well, I mean, I frankly couldn't believe it.
[01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:22.731]  I saw the news articles.
[01:31:22.771 --> 01:31:27.052]  The British media got me a map in, some of the code words from spies inside.
[01:31:27.632 --> 01:31:33.113]  And I frankly believe I was actually allowed to sneak in there now that I look at it as part of a larger throw-in-our-face move.
[01:31:33.794 --> 01:31:35.914]  But, I mean, this is out and out.
[01:31:35.994 --> 01:31:37.995]  Moloch, Satan Worship 101, Anton LaVey.
[01:31:39.555 --> 01:31:42.296]  Well, first, did you see any people running around naked there?
[01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:06.571]  It goes on for 15 days.
[01:32:06.591 --> 01:32:07.933]  I was there at the kickoff.
[01:32:08.354 --> 01:32:11.057]  David Gergen of the Washington Times said that they do indeed do that.
[01:32:12.138 --> 01:32:14.681]  Spy Magazine admits that they ship in the male prostitutes.
[01:32:15.042 --> 01:32:15.722]  I didn't see that.
[01:32:16.103 --> 01:32:17.645]  I saw some weird behavior.
[01:32:18.846 --> 01:32:23.472]  I'm not going to go up and show old men and bank chairmen with their...
[01:32:25.156 --> 01:32:26.237]  I saw some things.
[01:32:26.297 --> 01:32:35.444]  I saw mainly a strange urination ritual where two men walk up, pull their pants partially down, and then start urinating in front of each other.
[01:32:35.544 --> 01:32:36.625]  I didn't put that in the video.
[01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:37.666]  I had a hidden camera.
[01:32:37.726 --> 01:32:39.087]  I stayed away from the crowds.
[01:32:39.667 --> 01:32:43.930]  I got in, I hid out in the woods, I went and shot the ritual.
[01:32:44.771 --> 01:32:45.892]  So I didn't get a lot of that.
[01:32:45.952 --> 01:32:46.312]  I left.
[01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:47.393]  I was in there four hours.
[01:32:48.114 --> 01:32:53.438]  Supposedly the rituals get crazier and crazier in the two weeks, but no, I didn't see any running around naked.
[01:32:54.302 --> 01:33:00.347]  I remember Gergen said, when they asked him if he was going this year, he said, no, I don't want to see a bunch of old men running around naked.
[01:33:01.087 --> 01:33:02.148]  That's Washington Times.
[01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:04.029]  We only cover documented information, as you do.
[01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:05.991]  So, again, I'll quit jumping in.
[01:33:06.051 --> 01:33:07.052]  What is the New World Order?
[01:33:07.332 --> 01:33:08.633]  What will life be like under it?
[01:33:08.853 --> 01:33:09.594]  How do we stop it?
[01:33:09.654 --> 01:33:10.574]  What is the Illuminati?
[01:33:11.855 --> 01:33:19.501]  Well, the Illuminati flows from, and there's a connection with Iraq and what's going on here as well.
[01:33:20.805 --> 01:33:29.433]  The Illuminati formed by Adam Weishaupt was 1776, basically.
[01:33:29.493 --> 01:33:30.474]  There's more to it than that.
[01:33:30.574 --> 01:33:46.268]  But to make a long story short, they had thousands of members, including Goethe and Pestalozzi, who was an influence in education in America with their own code names, Aberus and some other names, John Dewey, his predecessor,
[01:33:46.923 --> 01:33:50.105]  My mentor was a G. Stanley Hall who had gotten his Ph.D.
[01:33:50.185 --> 01:33:57.728]  over at Leipzig under Wilhelm Wundt, whose grandfather was codenamed Raphael with the Illuminati.
[01:33:58.769 --> 01:34:06.292]  Basically, what they were doing, they would hook themselves up as, let's say, tutors of Alexander I in Russia.
[01:34:07.033 --> 01:34:08.313]  They would try to infiltrate.
[01:34:08.374 --> 01:34:13.296]  They went into the Parisian Outlaws League, fomented through Masonic Lodge's
[01:34:14.045 --> 01:34:39.968]  Often, the French Revolution, and their attitude was to destroy religion, destroy the heads of government, and basically people thought when the French Revolution said Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, it was like the U.S., but by Liberté they really meant license, and Égalité meant a leveling of the masses, and Fraternité really meant a brotherhood,
[01:34:40.869 --> 01:34:43.330]  That would foster a humanistic ideal.
[01:34:43.450 --> 01:34:54.435]  By the way, MSNBC admits when they talked to 100 Skull and Bones members, this was a few months ago, that they admit that in 1832 the German Illuminati came over with the Russell Trust and set up Skull and Bones.
[01:34:54.476 --> 01:34:55.056]  Please continue.
[01:34:56.316 --> 01:35:08.262]  Okay, and at that time you had their slogans of the Russell Trust and Alfonso Taft and a lot of the people, the early members of Skull and Bones would have similar mottos.
[01:35:08.792 --> 01:35:13.997]  They decided they were a sort of elite corps coming from a German elite corps.
[01:35:14.077 --> 01:35:18.681]  You would find swastikas in the tomb, as you call it sometimes.
[01:35:19.282 --> 01:35:22.885]  If you said they're Nazis or whatever, they'd say, no, no, this predates that.
[01:35:22.985 --> 01:35:24.586]  Yeah, swastikas and the skull.
[01:35:24.646 --> 01:35:31.512]  I mean, there's World War I, and even before that, Prussian top generals would wear the skull on their hat, and they were part of the societies.
[01:35:31.553 --> 01:35:31.873]  Go ahead.
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:45.392]  Yeah, and so you have these various connections with them that flow on up into various segments of this elite mentality using the swastika.
[01:35:45.552 --> 01:35:47.935]  Cecil Rhodes' mentor was a John Ruskin.
[01:35:48.075 --> 01:35:49.817]  He has a swastika on his grave.
[01:35:50.497 --> 01:35:52.599]  Rudyard Kipling is a member of the Rhodes Trust.
[01:35:52.639 --> 01:35:56.083]  If you look at the cover of his early books, they have swastikas on it.
[01:35:57.081 --> 01:36:02.205]  It was used as the key to the city of Seattle as a swastika on banks.
[01:36:02.545 --> 01:36:11.212]  There was a lot of this, and Blavatsky, who was with the Theosophical Society, founded that, used the symbol as an elitist mentality.
[01:36:11.272 --> 01:36:15.174]  These were the elite that were supposed to govern over the masses for our own good.
[01:36:15.855 --> 01:36:18.977]  And that's the attitude that they pretty much bring up to today.
[01:36:19.477 --> 01:36:23.100]  And they use situations to further their goals.
[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:25.322]  In terms of September 11th,
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:30.741]  What I try to do is I say, if there is this power leak, what might they do?
[01:36:31.281 --> 01:36:46.006]  And so prior to September 11th, in the book Secret Records Revealed and Globalist, I said the public could be conditioned by a terrorist attack so that they would be more willing to give up their freedoms in order to have peace and safety.
[01:36:46.026 --> 01:36:51.427]  Well, that's what Hart and Rudman and Brzezinski and all of them say.
[01:36:51.447 --> 01:36:52.868]  That's what Northwood says.
[01:36:53.984 --> 01:36:56.246]  Yeah, in 1962-ish.
[01:36:56.526 --> 01:37:07.232]  And so the very afternoon of September 11th, sure enough, ABC Washington Post comes out with a poll saying two-thirds of the public would be willing to give up some of our freedoms for peace and security and so forth.
[01:37:07.352 --> 01:37:09.013]  As if when you give up liberty, you get freedom.
[01:37:09.934 --> 01:37:11.115]  Yeah, right.
[01:37:12.035 --> 01:37:14.377]  It's the exact opposite of what our founder said.
[01:37:14.557 --> 01:37:19.940]  I think the quote is, he was willing to give up his freedom, but he's not going to have peace and security anyway.
[01:37:20.863 --> 01:37:34.786]  So, moving up to the current situation with Iraq, what I tried to do there was say, okay, if this power lead is in control of things, and if there's a war, a military conflict in Iraq, what will happen?
[01:37:34.806 --> 01:37:36.386]  And I said, there's two possibilities.
[01:37:36.986 --> 01:37:45.548]  I said, if it's a staged war, it'll be over relatively soon, with relatively few casualties, even from chemical or biological weapons,
[01:37:46.270 --> 01:37:47.611]  And that's basically what happened.
[01:37:47.691 --> 01:38:00.375]  I said, because if it had been a real war, what you would have had is Sodom torching the oil fields, which he didn't, destroying the air bases, H2 and H3 in the western part of Iraq, he didn't.
[01:38:03.959 --> 01:38:05.300]  Not a single bridge blown.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:12.006]  And then it came out, before the attack, they admitted that gold bars, goodies were being given to all the Iraqi generals and leaders.
[01:38:12.066 --> 01:38:14.808]  Most of them had already agreed to give up, signed capitulation orders.
[01:38:15.188 --> 01:38:23.876]  And then after the war, they got on MSNBC, I have it on tape, and they said, a ridiculous conspiracy theory that our government paid them off and secretly flew Saddam out.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:29.966]  And of course he'll probably grab some double and try him later, but Saddam was their CIA hitman in 1958.
[01:38:30.266 --> 01:38:31.727]  That's admitted!
[01:38:32.528 --> 01:38:38.995]  Yeah, he was part of a trained six-man assassination team back then, which wasn't really the first time.
[01:38:39.075 --> 01:38:47.804]  We had in 1953, when the Iranians nationalized their oil field, Norman Schwarzkopf, the general's daddy,
[01:38:48.768 --> 01:38:55.400]  I had just retired from the New Jersey State Police, and Alan Dulles with a secret $10 million CIA slush fund
[01:38:55.822 --> 01:38:59.644]  Paid him to train soldiers to overthrow that government of Iran.
[01:38:59.744 --> 01:39:02.866]  Yeah, he went to Saudi Arabia and they lived there, and that's where little Swartzy grew up.
[01:39:03.286 --> 01:39:06.168]  Yeah, so there was a history to that thing.
[01:39:06.208 --> 01:39:11.511]  And the Bin Ladens go back for carrying out Her Majesty's activities.
[01:39:12.131 --> 01:39:15.093]  The Bin Laden families had tried and trusted Little Klan, too, aren't they?
[01:39:15.513 --> 01:39:18.134]  They were also CIA assets.
[01:39:18.215 --> 01:39:22.497]  In fact, Daddy Bush used to stay with the Bin Ladens when he would visit over there.
[01:39:23.671 --> 01:39:26.473]  Still, you know, through Carlisle and some other aspects.
[01:39:26.493 --> 01:39:28.094]  Well, now Bechtel's involved in it.
[01:39:28.274 --> 01:39:34.699]  Yeah, that's George Shultz had been president, I think, of Bechtel just prior to the first.
[01:39:34.739 --> 01:39:36.100]  He was Secretary of State under Reagan.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:41.463]  Of course, George Shultz, according to major press reports, likes to take part in the rituals of Bohemian Grove, but that's part of being a Christian.
[01:39:41.784 --> 01:39:48.108]  That's right, and he's one of the Vulcans, as they call him, that trained George W. Bush to become president.
[01:39:48.468 --> 01:39:49.589]  Now, they have all these weird names.
[01:39:49.629 --> 01:39:51.531]  They call them Prince of Darkness, Vulcan.
[01:39:51.831 --> 01:39:53.812]  What are the different little code levels they have?
[01:39:55.113 --> 01:39:59.937]  Oh, they come up with all sorts of nicknames for them.
[01:40:00.197 --> 01:40:01.598]  Some are called Death Leaders.
[01:40:02.459 --> 01:40:03.440]  These are loving Christians.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.962]  If you say so.
[01:40:06.082 --> 01:40:12.647]  But a lot of people would say, who scoff at what you say about New World Order or whatever, they're reliant upon the press.
[01:40:13.237 --> 01:40:20.579]  And so whenever they say, well, gee, Dan Rather would have told me something about this, I say, look, this is very simple.
[01:40:21.519 --> 01:40:24.440]  It's been 18 months since September 11th, right?
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:25.421]  Oh, yeah, 18 months.
[01:40:25.861 --> 01:40:40.105]  And I say, look, has Dan Rather bothered at any time to tell you on the nightly news why on September 10th of 2001 some top Pentagon officials said,
[01:40:40.706 --> 01:40:46.868]  Suddenly picked up the phone and canceled their flight plans for the next morning because of security concerns.
[01:40:46.988 --> 01:40:51.769]  Has anybody asked why the FAA told Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco not to fly to New York that day?
[01:40:51.849 --> 01:40:54.949]  Or why Salman Rushdie in the Times of London called and asked the FAA?
[01:40:54.989 --> 01:40:58.050]  They admitted he was banned, quote, for his safety from flying that month.
[01:40:58.290 --> 01:41:01.171]  No one's asked why Bush was on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic.
[01:41:01.811 --> 01:41:05.133]  September 10th with his cabinet, four weeks before it showed up at Boca Raton.
[01:41:05.434 --> 01:41:19.923]  No one's asked why three of the so-called hijackers were trained at Pensacola Naval Air Station, the defense language, why the head of Pakistan Intelligence wired $100,000 to ATTA, and why the head of Pakistan Intelligence was there at the White House in Capitol Hill the week before 9-1-1.
[01:41:20.324 --> 01:41:22.065]  No one's asked any of these questions, have they?
[01:41:22.285 --> 01:41:31.131]  No one's asked why the AP reported that the CIA was doing a drill that morning of flying jets into buildings in New York and D.C., quote, their cover for why NORAD stood down.
[01:41:32.111 --> 01:41:38.233]  Yeah, and the same outfit had a similar drill the year before, and nobody picked up on that either.
[01:41:40.233 --> 01:41:42.914]  Well, they had the drill that morning at that very time.
[01:41:43.494 --> 01:41:45.034]  Just a drill, of course.
[01:41:45.594 --> 01:41:45.814]  Right.
[01:41:46.054 --> 01:41:51.396]  That way if you get compartmentalization breaking down and spilling over other people at the Pentagon or CIA going, hey, what's going on?
[01:41:51.776 --> 01:41:52.736]  Oh, just a drill.
[01:41:54.737 --> 01:41:55.417]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:41:55.797 --> 01:42:00.518]  They have all sorts of capabilities that we don't know about if...
[01:42:01.701 --> 01:42:08.747]  If you told people, let's say, that they were altering your brain waves, they'd look at you like you were some kind of idiot.
[01:42:09.347 --> 01:42:20.716]  So that's why, for example, in The Globalist, I actually put the patent number since 1976 where they've been able remotely, they don't even have to put the electrodes in your head, remotely alter your brain wave.
[01:42:20.777 --> 01:42:22.498]  Well, wait, I had the CEO on last year.
[01:42:22.598 --> 01:42:28.643]  The cut machines are about to come out with a beam that transmits where only you can hear it.
[01:42:29.306 --> 01:42:33.208]  Hey, have a nice cold Coke, and soon, off face scan, it'll say your name to you.
[01:42:34.849 --> 01:42:40.412]  Yeah, so what you have to do is manipulate the public, and that's why I think we had a close election.
[01:42:40.992 --> 01:42:49.417]  People say, oh, my goodness, you know, we can't criticize George W. Bush, because if we do, then those nasty old liberal Democrats will be back in control.
[01:42:49.657 --> 01:42:54.680]  But George Bush and Chuckie Schumer vote to federalize the elections and put in the touchscreens out of the crisis.
[01:42:56.119 --> 01:43:06.003]  And it wasn't Bill Clinton who had federal agents go into Pastor Dixon's Indiana church and drag him and some members of his congregation out either, was it?
[01:43:07.044 --> 01:43:07.804]  No, it wasn't.
[01:43:07.844 --> 01:43:12.466]  It was the Skull and Bones pastor that launched that attack.
[01:43:14.387 --> 01:43:17.188]  Well, isn't Anton LaVey a good Christian man, then, Dr. Petty?
[01:43:18.166 --> 01:43:20.588]  Well, I mean, you know, you wear black outfits, you worship Satan.
[01:43:20.608 --> 01:43:21.708]  Isn't that a Christian thing to do?
[01:43:23.029 --> 01:43:28.553]  No, neither is Alistair Crowley.
[01:43:28.633 --> 01:43:36.999]  Why do all these neocon Christian leaders say, submit to world government now, microchips aren't that bad, forced abortion's really okay over in China?
[01:43:37.359 --> 01:43:38.700]  Isn't that all Christian now?
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.201]  Isn't it us that has a problem?
[01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:42.642]  No, no, it's really not.
[01:43:43.883 --> 01:43:47.826]  Why suddenly do we see all the big Christian leaders telling us to submit to all this?
[01:43:49.901 --> 01:43:51.122]  Did you say why are they?
[01:43:51.383 --> 01:43:53.305]  Yeah, suddenly they're all telling us how good it is.
[01:43:53.505 --> 01:43:57.469]  Yeah, because of what I just said, the election was close.
[01:43:58.070 --> 01:44:11.404]  As long as you have the alternation of power that Quigley said the Skull and Bones plan had back under the Whitney's, that you have a Skull and Bones Bush replaced by a Rhodes Scholar Clinton, replaced by a Skull and Bones George W. Bush.
[01:44:11.989 --> 01:44:13.210]  Now, what about this election?
[01:44:13.230 --> 01:44:17.192]  We've got a skull-and-bones Kerry as the leader for the Democrats against a skull-and-bones Bush.
[01:44:17.613 --> 01:44:21.035]  Yeah, well, that would guarantee the eight years, just like Clinton had eight years.
[01:44:21.575 --> 01:44:24.037]  So if that were to occur, I don't think it will.
[01:44:24.057 --> 01:44:25.338]  I don't think Kerry's going to make it.
[01:44:25.678 --> 01:44:34.343]  But if it were to occur, then that would... See, one thing they do, that people looking for a conspiracy say, okay, what is their plan?
[01:44:35.044 --> 01:44:40.087]  Actually, their plan has several variations and alternatives, so they can make adjustments.
[01:44:41.069 --> 01:44:46.090]  That's why they really didn't have to call up 19 people and tell them to fly into the World Trade Center.
[01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:55.732]  What they did years ago was set up a mechanism whereby... Set up the CIA, find the young, ignorant Arabs, get them involved, have them seen at the scene over and over again.
[01:44:56.372 --> 01:44:57.673]  Tell you what, stay there, Dr. Cuddy.
[01:44:57.753 --> 01:44:59.353]  And can you hold with us into the next hour?
[01:45:00.313 --> 01:45:03.614]  Well, Violet said a half hour to an hour, so I guess I better go at the end.
[01:45:03.654 --> 01:45:04.094]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:45:04.114 --> 01:45:04.794]  We'll be right back with you.
[01:45:06.858 --> 01:45:17.584]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:45:17.785 --> 01:45:25.369]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:45:25.629 --> 01:45:28.731]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:45:28.891 --> 01:45:29.291]  We're good to go.
[01:45:47.563 --> 01:45:53.508]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:45:53.748 --> 01:45:58.011]  Get the Perky Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:45:58.031 --> 01:45:58.912]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:45:58.932 --> 01:46:01.114]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:46:10.939 --> 01:46:12.220]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:18.164]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:46:18.444 --> 01:46:23.688]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:46:23.988 --> 01:46:28.091]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:46:28.311 --> 01:46:32.075]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:46:32.356 --> 01:46:37.001]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:46:37.081 --> 01:46:43.348]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:46:43.388 --> 01:46:45.150]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:50.411]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:47:13.052 --> 01:47:18.858]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:20.520]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:28.008]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:47:28.268 --> 01:47:32.509]  Potassium iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[01:47:32.689 --> 01:47:35.070]  It works by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:47:35.230 --> 01:47:39.952]  This shields the thyroid and protects it from absorbing the radioactive iodine-131.
[01:47:40.152 --> 01:47:47.054]  There is only one emergency thyroid blocker formulated for babies, children, pets, and adults, and that's Medical Corps' potassium iodate.
[01:47:47.254 --> 01:47:50.535]  Best of all, unopened bottles can be stored for up to a decade.
[01:47:50.795 --> 01:47:54.196]  Order the official Medical Corps potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:47:56.457 --> 01:47:57.219]  Call toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:47:57.419 --> 01:47:58.320]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:58.581]  That's 888-803-
[01:48:18.585 --> 01:48:22.767]  Dr. Cuddy has agreed to stay with us for another 25 minutes, 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:48:22.787 --> 01:48:24.888]  That way we'll have time to take your calls.
[01:48:24.908 --> 01:48:28.029]  I know we've got folks already holding, wanting to talk to him like Wayne and others.
[01:48:28.590 --> 01:48:29.970]  A total free number to join us.
[01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:31.751]  This guy really is an expert on the New World Order.
[01:48:32.478 --> 01:48:33.038]  We're good to go.
[01:48:33.078 --> 01:48:33.399]  I think?
[01:48:58.376 --> 01:49:06.522]  Is Jeb Bush and Rumsfeld and Bush and Wolfowitz and Pearl saying, we need a Pearl Harbor catastrophic event to get our new world order.
[01:49:06.943 --> 01:49:08.864]  We need to be attacked so we can take over.
[01:49:09.525 --> 01:49:10.425]  Saddam isn't a threat.
[01:49:10.445 --> 01:49:11.326]  We want the oil.
[01:49:11.386 --> 01:49:13.487]  We want a military base to attack everybody.
[01:49:13.507 --> 01:49:16.650]  World War III, 100-year war, take everybody's rights.
[01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:17.630]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:49:18.631 --> 01:49:19.692]  It's all public.
[01:49:19.752 --> 01:49:21.393]  And I've made a new film, my friends.
[01:49:22.314 --> 01:49:25.116]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:49:26.096 --> 01:49:28.298]  And, you know, my videos just get better as they go along.
[01:49:28.338 --> 01:49:30.019]  This new one is amazing.
[01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:32.701]  Two hours and 37 minutes long.
[01:49:33.262 --> 01:49:34.423]  Totally jam-packed.
[01:49:34.543 --> 01:49:41.028]  You want to know a giant overview of what they're doing to you and what they plan to do to you, get the video.
[01:49:41.048 --> 01:49:43.690]  In fact, you can get the three Police State videos for $60.
[01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:45.332]  The films are $25.95 apiece.
[01:49:48.458 --> 01:49:50.099]  $20 if you order three or more apiece.
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:54.242]  My book is only $12, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:49:54.602 --> 01:49:56.523]  I have my other 9-1-1 films as well.
[01:49:56.943 --> 01:50:09.711]  Please go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and order VR Secure on a shopping cart or call toll-free today, right now, and you're authorized to make copies of my films for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:50:10.191 --> 01:50:10.511]  Get them.
[01:50:10.531 --> 01:50:13.393]  They're waking up 90% of those that will watch them.
[01:50:13.933 --> 01:50:15.094]  The toll-free number to order, 1-888-
[01:50:18.012 --> 01:50:18.052]  253-3139.
[01:50:18.072 --> 01:50:18.552]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:18.853 --> 01:50:20.594]  Or InfoWars.com or net.
[01:50:20.954 --> 01:50:27.099]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:50:27.399 --> 01:50:28.140]  Take action.
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.461]  Expose the terrorists.
[01:50:29.481 --> 01:50:30.742]  Expose the true evildoers.
[01:50:44.815 --> 01:50:46.916]  You know, Dr. Cuddy, Bush gives a lot of speeches.
[01:50:46.936 --> 01:50:49.598]  He gave one at the Pentagon talking about a dark cult of evil.
[01:50:50.038 --> 01:50:51.539]  No one knows the power of evil.
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:55.462]  The men that did the hijackings were instruments of this dark cult of evil.
[01:50:55.822 --> 01:50:58.003]  There's a lot of double meanings with these people.
[01:50:58.084 --> 01:50:59.224]  You get into that in your books.
[01:50:59.685 --> 01:51:02.546]  What are the books you recommend to the listeners of this show, and how do they get them?
[01:51:03.567 --> 01:51:06.889]  Well, there's a number of books.
[01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:10.832]  I guess the main ones would be the current one that's just coming out.
[01:51:10.892 --> 01:51:13.213]  It's called Cover Up, Government's Spinner Truth.
[01:51:13.353 --> 01:51:14.374]  It deals with the
[01:51:15.057 --> 01:51:17.078]  September 11th issue and Iraq.
[01:51:17.218 --> 01:51:21.559]  As I said, I made some predictions as well as our vanishing constitutional rights.
[01:51:21.679 --> 01:51:32.243]  The one just before that was titled September 11th, Prior Knowledge, where I do some investigation and basically conclude that we had the information to know what would happen in advance.
[01:51:33.004 --> 01:51:36.347]  The one prior to that came out just prior to September 11th.
[01:51:36.387 --> 01:51:39.449]  That's called The Globalists, The Power Elite Exposed.
[01:51:39.629 --> 01:51:41.111]  Try and put some actual letters.
[01:51:41.131 --> 01:51:48.196]  You've got the textbooks for the kids, the people going to college to be social workers, saying, we'll destroy the family, we must do it now.
[01:51:49.157 --> 01:51:51.779]  Yeah, that's a plan from a long time ago.
[01:51:51.799 --> 01:51:52.980]  Their own textbooks.
[01:51:53.241 --> 01:51:53.941]  How do folks get them?
[01:51:54.842 --> 01:51:56.103]  Call toll-free 888-891-3300.
[01:52:03.615 --> 01:52:05.778]  888-891-3300, 888-891-3300.
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:10.624]  And some of your books are in bookstores, correct?
[01:52:10.944 --> 01:52:11.805]  They can be.
[01:52:12.226 --> 01:52:13.768]  And they're in a lot of Christian bookstores.
[01:52:14.188 --> 01:52:14.849]  Yes, that's true.
[01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:17.332]  Those that don't believe Skull and Bones is Christian.
[01:52:18.393 --> 01:52:18.633]  Right.
[01:52:18.673 --> 01:52:23.257]  There's a new type of Christianity where, you know, Anton LaVey's a good guy, but we're not that type here.
[01:52:23.337 --> 01:52:23.897]  Sorry, folks.
[01:52:24.157 --> 01:52:26.319]  Well, that's part of the plan, too.
[01:52:26.379 --> 01:52:33.485]  John Dewey had what he called a common faith, where he said dogmatic religions, dogmatic Christianity would have to surrender to this humanism.
[01:52:34.186 --> 01:52:37.708]  And that's what they called for after 9-1-1, coffee and we need a world religion.
[01:52:38.129 --> 01:52:39.770]  All right, your calls for Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[01:52:39.810 --> 01:52:40.611]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:52:41.471 --> 01:52:42.211]  Third hour coming up.
[01:52:42.231 --> 01:52:43.212]  We'll be with us for about 20 minutes.
[01:52:43.232 --> 01:52:45.433]  We'll talk to Wayne and others.
[01:52:45.453 --> 01:52:45.954]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:52:45.974 --> 01:52:51.196]  And remember, my new film, Police State Free, is now out.
[01:52:53.878 --> 01:52:57.200]  Jones USA offers an alternative to duct tape and plastic.
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:04.484]  Our portable nuclear biological chemical shelter, the PNBC-273, uses an advanced NBC filtering system.
[01:53:08.675 --> 01:53:11.896]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.558 --> 01:53:20.218]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.859 --> 01:53:21.939]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.639 --> 01:53:23.819]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:25.240]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:26.840]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:31.202]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.722 --> 01:53:35.803]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:38.664 --> 01:53:39.745]  All right, my friends.
[01:53:40.025 --> 01:53:43.926]  Already into the third and final hour of this Wednesday live edition.
[01:53:43.946 --> 01:53:46.007]  We do this show Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:53:46.067 --> 01:53:47.288]  until 2 p.m.
[01:53:47.648 --> 01:53:52.730]  Central Time and back from 9 to midnight Central Time with a rebroadcast of the daytime show from 1 a.m.
[01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:53.490]  to 4 a.m.
[01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:56.031]  The websites are infowars.com and net.
[01:53:56.351 --> 01:54:05.855]  Talking to Dennis Lawrence Cuddy, Dennis Cuddy, historian, political analyst, Ph.D., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, major in American history, minor in political science.
[01:54:06.235 --> 01:54:14.929]  Dr. Cuddy has taught at the university level and has been a political and economic risk analysis analyst for the international consulting firm and has been a senior associate with the U.S.
[01:54:14.949 --> 01:54:15.931]  Department of Education.
[01:54:16.331 --> 01:54:18.955]  He has also testified before members of the Congress on behalf of the U.S.
[01:54:18.975 --> 01:54:19.737]  Department of Justice.
[01:54:20.502 --> 01:54:26.524]  Dr. Cuddy has edited 17 books and booklets and has written hundreds of articles appearing in newspapers around the nation.
[01:54:27.005 --> 01:54:29.486]  Dr. Cuddy, we routinely link to articles you've written.
[01:54:29.526 --> 01:54:32.287]  I know newswithviews.com carries some of your stuff.
[01:54:32.647 --> 01:54:35.988]  Where can people read some of your other insightful, lengthy articles?
[01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:45.452]  Well, I have a book that's called American Commentary at that same toll-free number that says a collection of them.
[01:54:46.341 --> 01:54:51.425]  There are others, an article or two on the World Net Daily website.
[01:54:51.685 --> 01:55:04.115]  I've got a link here on Infowars.com, your expanded addendum to cover up government spin or truth, a 23-page analysis you did, I guess a segment from your new book.
[01:55:04.876 --> 01:55:14.263]  Yeah, what happened was, of course, as you know with your books, you write them in advance, and so a lot's happened during the last month, and there's a small addendum in the book cover-up
[01:55:14.795 --> 01:55:32.307]  But so much has happened that I put an expanded addendum that you just referred to on newswithviews.com where I go through basically what's happened and conclude with, as you said about the Illuminati, Voltaire, who was behind the French Revolution, was hooked up with these people.
[01:55:32.787 --> 01:55:41.974]  And if you look at the Statue of Liberty, it came from the French Freemasons, really the Liberté, don't impose morality, do your own thing.
[01:55:41.994 --> 01:55:42.634]  Do as thou wilt.
[01:55:44.789 --> 01:55:58.561]  Yeah, and what you find is that there's seven rays on her head, and the picture from ancient times of Semiramis, the goddess who founded Babylon, Iraq, is exactly like that with the seven rays.
[01:55:59.262 --> 01:56:03.606]  And Voltaire wrote a play called Semiramis, so there's this connection there.
[01:56:04.266 --> 01:56:04.807]  Absolutely.
[01:56:04.867 --> 01:56:06.608]  Let's go to the calls.
[01:56:07.629 --> 01:56:10.131]  Let's talk to Wayne in Virginia.
[01:56:10.151 --> 01:56:11.432]  You're on the air with Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[01:56:11.452 --> 01:56:11.973]  Thanks for holding.
[01:56:12.614 --> 01:56:12.974]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:12.994 --> 01:56:14.935]  Dr. Cuddy, good to hear you today.
[01:56:15.936 --> 01:56:21.998]  You were starting out a little earlier with a development discussion on Mr. Crystal.
[01:56:22.018 --> 01:56:23.139]  I don't know if you quite got to it.
[01:56:23.159 --> 01:56:25.780]  I'd like to hear the rest of what you were going to tell us about Mr. Crystal.
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:27.161]  Ultra calming.
[01:56:27.401 --> 01:56:35.685]  And I also wanted to ask how you respond to those who say that due to the animosity between the posed or
[01:56:36.688 --> 01:56:40.691]  False animosity between the United States and Europe and Germany that the New World Order is dead.
[01:56:40.711 --> 01:56:43.793]  Well, we talked about that, how it's a synthesis.
[01:56:44.374 --> 01:56:46.015]  We're playing the part of the bad cop.
[01:56:46.055 --> 01:56:55.662]  The UN plays the part of the good cop to keep everybody in the control, giving them two different versions of the New World Order is what their policy reports have said to bypass any discussion of not having a New World Order.
[01:56:55.682 --> 01:56:56.383]  Go ahead, Dr. Cuddy.
[01:56:56.783 --> 01:56:59.645]  Does he have any documentation about anticipating that?
[01:57:00.325 --> 01:57:02.407]  The globalists have said that in their own policy reports.
[01:57:02.447 --> 01:57:03.007]  I can dig them out.
[01:57:03.047 --> 01:57:03.688]  Go ahead, Dr. Cuddy.
[01:57:05.432 --> 01:57:11.516]  Yeah, like I said, I tried to include that in the cover-up, the current book, and September 11th and the other things.
[01:57:12.176 --> 01:57:18.440]  In terms of William Crystal, very quickly, where I was was William Bennett became head of the Department of Education.
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:22.223]  Where I was, he brought Bill William Crystal as his chief of staff.
[01:57:22.703 --> 01:57:24.504]  From there, he became chief of staff.
[01:57:24.564 --> 01:57:28.327]  Crystal did to Dan Quayle, and from there, he got his current position in my department.
[01:57:28.692 --> 01:57:35.377]  My point is, I think this was like a 25, 30-year plan of Irving Kristol, his daddy, who Alex mentioned.
[01:57:36.157 --> 01:57:37.959]  Who was the socialist?
[01:57:38.039 --> 01:57:40.721]  Well, they would say Trotskyites from years ago.
[01:57:42.582 --> 01:57:49.447]  Oh, the neocons, a Trotskyite, but he wants police in black uniforms, and all your liberty's gone, and a global government.
[01:57:49.467 --> 01:57:51.848]  Oh, they're so conservative, and Bush wants your guns.
[01:57:52.689 --> 01:57:54.010]  Anything else you want to add, Wayne?
[01:57:54.971 --> 01:57:56.412]  So, the...
[01:57:57.921 --> 01:58:02.885]  Making Crystal Chief of Staff when Bush Senior... Stay there.
[01:58:02.905 --> 01:58:06.648]  I'll let you finish up on the other side, Wayne, and then we'll go to Randy and plenty others.
[01:58:06.668 --> 01:58:06.788]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:06.868 --> 01:58:07.749]  Your calls for Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[01:58:07.989 --> 01:58:08.489]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.763 --> 01:58:23.168]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:58:23.408 --> 01:58:28.151]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:58:28.371 --> 01:58:34.015]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:58:34.255 --> 01:58:38.777]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:58:39.017 --> 01:58:46.161]  The casual society control grid, impalpable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:58:46.181 --> 01:58:50.503]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:58:50.883 --> 01:58:53.405]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:58:53.625 --> 01:59:00.368]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:20.681]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:22.242 --> 02:01:31.147]  Controlling the left and right, controlling the outcome, controlling the debate, and I'm glad that Dennis Cuddy has this great understanding of the phony left-right system and how the U.N.
[02:01:31.167 --> 02:01:38.011]  is playing a part of the good cop of the third world as America uses the muscle for the new world order to take over the last few sovereign nations.
[02:01:39.196 --> 02:01:41.778]  We're not debating whether it's good people that run these nations or not.
[02:01:41.838 --> 02:01:45.320]  The point is, the big master plan is to totally dumb us down and dominate us.
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:52.944]  And before Dr. Cuddy leaves us, I want to ask him what life will be like under the New World Order's dreams if they're able to get everything they want.
[02:01:53.825 --> 02:01:55.906]  But right now, let's go back to Wayne in Virginia.
[02:01:55.946 --> 02:01:57.627]  Wayne, you have one more question for Dr. Cuddy.
[02:01:57.647 --> 02:01:58.007]  Go ahead.
[02:01:58.828 --> 02:01:59.248]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:59.328 --> 02:02:03.951]  I just wanted to know how on earth they were successful in getting...
[02:02:05.194 --> 02:02:13.444]  This gentleman, Mr. Crystal, to be chief of staff of the bone that had been thrown to the conservative Christians at the time of Mr. Quayle's appointment as vice president.
[02:02:14.425 --> 02:02:15.687]  Was Bush running the whole thing?
[02:02:16.548 --> 02:02:17.749]  I mean, here's the question.
[02:02:17.769 --> 02:02:23.233]  How do we have the neocons, most of them, right out of the loins of Trotskyites, calling for big government?
[02:02:23.273 --> 02:02:24.714]  How do they do this?
[02:02:24.754 --> 02:02:29.637]  And the answer is the media set up and played ball with the phony left-right system and never told you that.
[02:02:29.677 --> 02:02:30.298]  Go ahead, Doctor.
[02:02:31.299 --> 02:02:35.742]  Yeah, and that specifically, like I said, was part of a staged process.
[02:02:35.802 --> 02:02:40.165]  He could not have gotten that position unless he had been chief of staff to Bill Bennett.
[02:02:40.532 --> 02:02:47.679]  And that's why Irving Kristol's dad was promoting Bill Bennett early on many, many years before.
[02:02:49.841 --> 02:02:50.482]  All right, gentlemen.
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:52.401]  All right, I appreciate the call.
[02:02:52.461 --> 02:03:06.317]  Yeah, when you see all these neocons, I mean, you know, Michael Savage admitted beatnik, admitted, you know, dirty commie, up there saying line up Americans, put them in prisons if they criticize the government.
[02:03:06.937 --> 02:03:09.040]  I mean, they're on the air saying this.
[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:10.621]  They're all in the same bag.
[02:03:11.783 --> 02:03:12.844]  And is it admitted beatnik?
[02:03:13.722 --> 02:03:17.345]  It's funny, isn't it, Dr. Coy, to see beatniks telling us that they're conservative.
[02:03:17.385 --> 02:03:18.166]  That's interesting, isn't it?
[02:03:19.207 --> 02:03:19.507]  Yeah.
[02:03:19.987 --> 02:03:21.969]  And there's a third group.
[02:03:22.329 --> 02:03:26.793]  We had mentioned the Project for the New American Century and the Crystals, and then Gary Hart with the U.S.
[02:03:26.813 --> 02:03:28.074]  Commission on National Security.
[02:03:28.114 --> 02:03:43.046]  A third group, since you're in Texas, is a year before September 11th, the James Baker, former Secretary of State Institute, in joint operation with the CFR itself, funded a study...
[02:03:43.593 --> 02:03:48.376]  Heavily with oil people saying we need to secure the oil from the Caspian Sea area.
[02:03:48.416 --> 02:03:51.818]  That would be, you know, we were going to pump it down through Afghanistan.
[02:03:52.078 --> 02:03:53.919]  That Saddam was a threat to the Gulf oil.
[02:03:53.959 --> 02:03:57.341]  We needed to make economic and military assessments of what we could do.
[02:03:57.861 --> 02:04:01.803]  And if we somehow got a deal for the Iraq reserves, that would be a major asset.
[02:04:01.883 --> 02:04:05.485]  And this is so they could just act smart and get it out to their low-level intellectuals.
[02:04:05.826 --> 02:04:08.227]  They've been getting ready for Gulf, too, since the end of the last one.
[02:04:09.088 --> 02:04:12.673]  Yeah, in fact, in the first one, there was Bush.
[02:04:12.713 --> 02:04:18.481]  First President Bush's primary concern was that we would not have a war, that Saddam would withdraw his forces.
[02:04:18.962 --> 02:04:22.727]  Colin Powell and Baker were going to go over negotiations, and at that moment,
[02:04:23.654 --> 02:04:24.715]  Bush Sr.
[02:04:24.755 --> 02:04:28.659]  and Brent Scowcroft looked at each other and said, no, we have to have this war.
[02:04:29.119 --> 02:04:33.463]  And so my inclination is that George W. Bush had to have this war.
[02:04:33.803 --> 02:04:39.288]  And now they're already... Have you seen the incredible, insane statements of we're going to go ahead and invade more countries?
[02:04:39.308 --> 02:04:40.309]  Yeah, others are next.
[02:04:40.909 --> 02:04:49.636]  And they're threatening psychopaths with nukes, saying, and then Rumsfeld's little document gets released saying they're going to start bombing North Korea this October?
[02:04:49.956 --> 02:04:53.679]  I mean, is that not like trying to push the Japanese to launch a Pearl Harbor?
[02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:55.841]  The North Koreans, yeah.
[02:04:56.722 --> 02:05:05.969]  Kim Il-jung and then, yeah, the threat to that region is clear, but you have to remember what you said earlier about dumbing the people down.
[02:05:06.519 --> 02:05:13.522]  For example, Bush, when he had 9-11 and he was going to have an investigation, he appoints Henry Kissinger.
[02:05:15.103 --> 02:05:24.647]  If the public would have even the slightest knowledge about Henry Kissinger, they would say, why are you putting in charge of this investigation a man who is called our soldier's, quote,
[02:05:25.727 --> 02:05:33.315]  And the guy publicly says this and we call him a conservative because the neocons won't tell us.
[02:05:33.996 --> 02:05:38.881]  And on top of it, now the guy they're going to have run Iraq turns out worked for Kissinger Associates.
[02:05:38.941 --> 02:05:40.623]  Kissinger's involved in all of this.
[02:05:41.043 --> 02:05:43.466]  That's like having Joseph Mingala investigate Hitler.
[02:05:45.340 --> 02:05:52.167]  Yeah, and Kissinger's also hooked up with McLarty, Matt McLarty now, so it's McLarty, Kissinger, and Associates.
[02:05:52.207 --> 02:05:53.929]  They're branching out.
[02:05:54.209 --> 02:05:56.612]  How did Pearl get the nickname Prince of Darkness?
[02:05:57.432 --> 02:06:02.377]  Oh, I think that was an appellation given to him by his detractors.
[02:06:02.517 --> 02:06:08.043]  He looks sort of very stern and always serious, and I think there have been plays...
[02:06:08.533 --> 02:06:12.236]  That it involved, quote, the Prince of Darkness and he has some look like that.
[02:06:12.296 --> 02:06:16.459]  Well, yeah, he glows kind of that, you know, people that really have that glow-in-the-dark look.
[02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:19.641]  But, you know, we don't care about what he looks like.
[02:06:19.661 --> 02:06:20.221]  It's what he says.
[02:06:20.862 --> 02:06:22.463]  Randy in Georgia, you're on the air.
[02:06:22.503 --> 02:06:23.064]  Go ahead, Randy.
[02:06:23.884 --> 02:06:25.225]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:06:26.686 --> 02:06:37.374]  I've been listening to you for months, and, you know, it's not something that you want to believe, but the more you guys go on, the
[02:06:38.250 --> 02:06:47.196]  The more of an intent, I begin to believe it because I watch the events that are predicted and the way things are going.
[02:06:47.817 --> 02:06:59.445]  Well, I mean, when Knight Ritter newspaper says neocons want new world order, Bush wants your guns, I mean, supercomputers in China, open borders, campaign finance reform, I mean, this guy is Bill Clinton on steroids.
[02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:02.107]  Antichrist is what it seems like.
[02:07:03.824 --> 02:07:04.845]  Well, no, sir.
[02:07:04.905 --> 02:07:06.526]  Skull and Bones is a Christian organization.
[02:07:06.586 --> 02:07:08.567]  Please don't attack this Christian president again.
[02:07:08.587 --> 02:07:17.911]  Oh, well, we wouldn't want to do that, but... Ask your preacher if you can come to the Baptist church if you start wearing an Anton LaVey suit.
[02:07:18.732 --> 02:07:23.054]  And then when he has a problem with it, say, wait a minute, this is what the president wears.
[02:07:23.314 --> 02:07:24.054]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:07:25.435 --> 02:07:26.716]  I'm not kidding about that, by the way.
[02:07:26.736 --> 02:07:27.516]  They caught video of it.
[02:07:27.536 --> 02:07:29.197]  They dressed up in satanic outfits.
[02:07:29.913 --> 02:07:30.674]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:07:31.474 --> 02:07:39.441]  I don't know where you got the term neocons, but I think it's more appropriate that you call them pseudo-cons.
[02:07:40.342 --> 02:07:41.283]  Well, that's really what they are.
[02:07:41.863 --> 02:07:43.825]  Dr. Cuddy, you want to tell them where neocon comes from?
[02:07:44.785 --> 02:07:54.974]  Yeah, many years ago you had your basically traditional conservatives throughout the first part of the 20th century, and then there were these leftist Trotskyite-types
[02:07:55.527 --> 02:08:02.412]  Socialists, as I said, Mitch Dechter, who's part of this, was the vice president of what had been called the Intercollegiate Socialist Society.
[02:08:02.492 --> 02:08:04.273]  They're minute infiltrators.
[02:08:04.373 --> 02:08:13.080]  And they basically started to have a problem with the direction they saw the Soviet Union going in persecution against Jews and other people and so on.
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:18.784]  And so in terms of foreign policy, they had a shift to conservative.
[02:08:18.824 --> 02:08:20.725]  Now, on a domestic agenda, sometimes they're not.
[02:08:21.215 --> 02:08:26.956]  But in foreign policy, they had a shift, and so they came to this type of, quote, conservatism late.
[02:08:27.476 --> 02:08:29.097]  That's what we're supposed to believe.
[02:08:29.417 --> 02:08:30.037]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:08:30.097 --> 02:08:33.658]  They're really not, quote, conservative in the traditional sense of it.
[02:08:34.018 --> 02:08:49.521]  And they have come to dominate it so much that even Ted Koppel on Nightline had a program talking about the PNAG project for the New American Century, and he had a professor Lustick on there from Pennsylvania, and he said these guys, quote, control the White House now.
[02:08:50.385 --> 02:08:52.287]  Okay, I can get that.
[02:08:54.049 --> 02:08:55.631]  My question is this, okay?
[02:08:56.913 --> 02:09:06.363]  The average Joe doesn't have a lot of time to devote to really winnowing the truth.
[02:09:06.424 --> 02:09:08.666]  Yeah, but I bet that average Joe knows all the baseball scores.
[02:09:11.966 --> 02:09:15.448]  I bet he's got plenty of time in to go to the fancy restaurant and eat T-bones.
[02:09:15.608 --> 02:09:16.189]  Well, you're right.
[02:09:16.789 --> 02:09:18.870]  He's going to have to make time.
[02:09:18.930 --> 02:09:20.031]  He's not going to have a job.
[02:09:20.071 --> 02:09:21.272]  His kids are going to be in prison.
[02:09:21.552 --> 02:09:22.493]  He's not going to have a life.
[02:09:23.153 --> 02:09:23.813]  Right.
[02:09:23.833 --> 02:09:25.434]  You have to make a concerted effort.
[02:09:25.554 --> 02:09:28.116]  And there comes to a point where you tumble to that.
[02:09:28.877 --> 02:09:33.079]  My suggestion is this, or I'm asking for information.
[02:09:33.119 --> 02:09:33.960]  You may know something.
[02:09:35.581 --> 02:09:37.522]  What is the best place
[02:09:38.593 --> 02:09:42.636]  You find, like, PDF documents, you know, that are easily downloadable.
[02:09:42.676 --> 02:09:45.718]  Well, are you saying the average Joe isn't going to read a PDF document?
[02:09:45.758 --> 02:09:48.400]  That's prisonplanet.com, infowars.com.
[02:09:49.241 --> 02:09:51.823]  My videos are tailor-made for the general public.
[02:09:52.123 --> 02:09:52.903]  People aren't stupid.
[02:09:52.923 --> 02:09:55.906]  They're just not into reading giant dossiers and stuff.
[02:09:55.966 --> 02:09:57.186]  I mean, Cuddy's books are good.
[02:09:57.207 --> 02:09:59.448]  They're very readable and very frightening.
[02:09:59.468 --> 02:10:01.790]  So, you know, it's like reading a nightmare novel, but it's real.
[02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:07.975]  I'd give you some of his books, but I have to tell you, my videos are waking up 90% of those that see them.
[02:10:08.335 --> 02:10:10.237]  Thanks for the call, Randy.
[02:10:10.257 --> 02:10:14.160]  Dr. Cunningham, not a selfless plug, but I didn't know you'd seen some of my videos.
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:15.221]  What videos have you seen?
[02:10:16.402 --> 02:10:20.185]  The Police State, I think, 2 and the 9-11 one.
[02:10:20.625 --> 02:10:21.626]  What did you think of the videos?
[02:10:23.627 --> 02:10:24.148]  Pretty good.
[02:10:24.208 --> 02:10:33.317]  I liked basically the live shots, for example, where the federal agent there is in Kansas or wherever he is and telling the...
[02:10:34.916 --> 02:10:41.378]  And the training manuals that Christians are terrorists, homeschoolers.
[02:10:41.398 --> 02:10:42.638]  Yeah, that's kind of a wake-up call.
[02:10:42.878 --> 02:10:44.299]  Yeah, from the Phoenix office.
[02:10:44.639 --> 02:10:48.400]  I mean, if they would have put that in the movie Red Dawn, we'd have gone, those darn commies.
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:51.541]  But here in America, it's, oh, wow, they're friendly.
[02:10:52.681 --> 02:10:53.961]  Let's talk to John in Florida.
[02:10:53.981 --> 02:10:55.241]  John, you're on the air with Dr. Cuddy.
[02:10:55.802 --> 02:10:57.082]  Yes, good afternoon.
[02:10:57.122 --> 02:10:58.022]  Good to hear you, Alex.
[02:10:58.082 --> 02:11:00.523]  Thank you very much for the interview with Dr. Cuddy today.
[02:11:00.543 --> 02:11:01.143]  It's excellent.
[02:11:02.252 --> 02:11:05.114]  Dr. Cuddy, you were at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill?
[02:11:05.635 --> 02:11:08.937]  No, I was, and then I went to the U.S.
[02:11:08.957 --> 02:11:12.179]  Department of Education in Washington, and now I'm back writing.
[02:11:12.459 --> 02:11:15.081]  Incidentally, was that your wake-up call being inside there?
[02:11:16.362 --> 02:11:16.782]  Who, me?
[02:11:17.263 --> 02:11:17.663]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:17.983 --> 02:11:24.188]  No, I had been, I think, unbeknownst to me, I was being groomed to be one of these people in the early 60s.
[02:11:24.248 --> 02:11:26.049]  I went to Carnegie-funded...
[02:11:26.624 --> 02:11:29.407]  For those who don't know, that's how the Illuminati did it with the Masons.
[02:11:29.587 --> 02:11:30.788]  They give you questionnaires.
[02:11:30.808 --> 02:11:31.429]  Will you do this?
[02:11:31.449 --> 02:11:31.810]  Will you do that?
[02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:32.250]  What's your view?
[02:11:32.290 --> 02:11:32.570]  Doctor?
[02:11:32.590 --> 02:11:32.731]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:33.872]  How's your family name spelled, please?
[02:11:49.115 --> 02:11:52.137]  C-U-D-D-Y.
[02:11:52.337 --> 02:11:52.577]  Uh-huh.
[02:11:52.918 --> 02:11:53.198]  Okay.
[02:11:53.478 --> 02:11:55.740]  I have an anecdotal comment and a question.
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:00.903]  Back in 1960, I purchased the used bookstore two publications by Adolf Hitler.
[02:12:00.923 --> 02:12:02.824]  The first was Mein Kampf that I read.
[02:12:03.224 --> 02:12:10.149]  The second was a book of all of his written and spoken speeches called The New Order.
[02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:12.830]  Which is a book that most people are unaware of.
[02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:16.112]  I got Hitler on tape saying we will build a new world order.
[02:12:16.412 --> 02:12:21.014]  These are hardcover books printed by a prestigious New York City publishing firm.
[02:12:21.034 --> 02:12:22.774]  Well, let's get a comment from Dr. Cuddy on that.
[02:12:23.775 --> 02:12:37.121]  Well, my question also is, are you aware of the NATO symbol, the swastikas that are concealed, very well camouflaged within the NATO four-pointed star and the interrupted circles?
[02:12:38.685 --> 02:12:45.615]  No, but I know there are little swastikas on the primary temple of the Scottish Rite in Washington.
[02:12:47.013 --> 02:12:50.294]  The National Security Agency symbol also is bothersome.
[02:12:50.454 --> 02:12:51.354]  I hear the music, though.
[02:12:51.374 --> 02:12:52.794]  Yeah, folks, they're the cultists.
[02:12:52.974 --> 02:12:54.234]  It's a sun god symbol.
[02:12:54.975 --> 02:13:02.956]  Dr. Cuddy, do five more minutes with us, because I want to come back and plug your books again, and I want to take a call from Tom in California, and that'll be it for calls for our guests.
[02:13:03.076 --> 02:13:13.318]  One more quick segment with our guests, just a little five-minute segment, and then I'm going to get into some of the news I haven't covered yet, the incredible corruption, a bunch of world events, and some gun grabbing by the neocons.
[02:13:15.015 --> 02:13:21.220]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:29.466]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:13:29.807 --> 02:13:37.653]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:13:37.953 --> 02:13:39.893]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:14:06.099 --> 02:14:09.201]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax-exempt?
[02:14:34.497 --> 02:14:36.059]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[02:14:36.319 --> 02:14:37.160]  Well, there is a way.
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:43.546]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[02:14:43.906 --> 02:14:54.176]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[02:14:54.236 --> 02:14:55.057]  Constitution.
[02:14:55.317 --> 02:14:56.938]  You don't have to go offshore to do it, either.
[02:14:57.219 --> 02:14:59.501]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[02:14:59.961 --> 02:15:07.673]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the Internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:15:07.954 --> 02:15:12.380]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:15:16.269 --> 02:15:16.789]  It's here.
[02:15:17.070 --> 02:15:17.770]  It's powerful.
[02:15:18.070 --> 02:15:26.655]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[02:15:26.955 --> 02:15:28.796]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[02:15:29.056 --> 02:15:31.137]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[02:15:31.397 --> 02:15:35.659]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[02:15:35.919 --> 02:15:41.642]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[02:15:41.822 --> 02:15:43.603]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[02:15:43.763 --> 02:15:46.984]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[02:15:47.184 --> 02:15:48.745]  Get the powerful Berkey now.
[02:15:49.025 --> 02:15:55.548]  Ideal for everyday use, for outdoor sporting events, and in the event of a local or national emergency, you'll be prepared.
[02:15:55.908 --> 02:15:56.969]  Normally $279.
[02:15:57.609 --> 02:16:00.431]  Order now for the special price of only $239 and save $40.
[02:16:00.552 --> 02:16:01.472]  Call toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:16:01.492 --> 02:16:01.933]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:16:01.953 --> 02:16:04.074]  Not yet available in California and Iowa.
[02:16:12.930 --> 02:16:13.431]  We're good to go.
[02:16:27.910 --> 02:16:28.170]  The book,
[02:16:55.131 --> 02:16:59.815]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[02:17:00.035 --> 02:17:03.958]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[02:17:04.079 --> 02:17:06.020]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll free, 1-800-255-1912.
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:07.061]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com.
[02:17:19.827 --> 02:17:21.729]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:17:22.209 --> 02:17:25.032]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:28.194 --> 02:17:30.276]  All right, our final segment with Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[02:17:30.316 --> 02:17:35.280]  I'll be back for the last half of this hour getting into the news we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:37.202]  Believe me, it's very important, so stay with us.
[02:17:37.662 --> 02:17:39.043]  The New World Order is a real thing.
[02:17:39.524 --> 02:17:41.906]  The devil's biggest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[02:17:42.206 --> 02:17:42.806]  They've done that.
[02:17:42.907 --> 02:17:43.867]  Now it's in your face.
[02:17:44.007 --> 02:17:45.068]  All these years we warned you.
[02:17:45.128 --> 02:17:45.909]  Now it's in your face.
[02:17:46.349 --> 02:17:47.871]  Your police are dressed up like Nazis.
[02:17:49.051 --> 02:17:50.832]  The control grid is being put in place.
[02:17:50.852 --> 02:17:53.193]  The new economy will be prisons and total domination.
[02:17:53.533 --> 02:17:56.795]  I want to take a few calls from Tom and Mike before we wrap up this interview, Dr. Cuddy.
[02:17:56.815 --> 02:18:00.817]  But what will life be like under the New World Order if they get their way?
[02:18:01.978 --> 02:18:05.940]  Well, eventually, of course, biblically you have an Antichrist.
[02:18:06.020 --> 02:18:12.484]  But before then, as you said, if you play the good cop, bad cop, what they hope to do is what Orwell said.
[02:18:12.504 --> 02:18:14.805]  They would quicken the tempo of human life, which they did.
[02:18:15.285 --> 02:18:18.367]  They wanted to keep the masses busy and entertained.
[02:18:18.852 --> 02:18:21.714]  So that you would actually, as he said, come to love Big Brother.
[02:18:21.754 --> 02:18:25.437]  You would go along with the President if they wanted to get us into a war.
[02:18:25.477 --> 02:18:28.180]  You wouldn't ask too many questions and so forth.
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:32.403]  The introduction, though, you had to have German troops here.
[02:18:32.543 --> 02:18:36.426]  We settled 8,000 Iraqi soldiers here after the first Gulf War.
[02:18:36.667 --> 02:18:39.849]  Now they sign deals to bring in Canadian, Mexican, Dutch.
[02:18:40.730 --> 02:18:44.013]  Right, and the southern border is still a sieve.
[02:18:44.033 --> 02:18:45.654]  You've got terrorists coming across there.
[02:18:46.246 --> 02:18:51.471]  But basically, what you would have to do is have an external policing mechanism.
[02:18:51.571 --> 02:18:59.479]  So in 1952, there was a map drawn of when the new world order, world government, finally came about, what nations would be policing other nations.
[02:18:59.958 --> 02:19:09.641]  And according to that 1952 map, it said American forces would be in Yugoslavia, where they are now, in Kazakhstan, where they are now, in Australia, where they are now, and so forth.
[02:19:10.041 --> 02:19:20.323]  And foreign troops, Mongolian, Chinese troops, would be in the lower part of California, where, you know, Costco and... Right here in Texas, Czechoslovakia, and just so happens that's who's here.
[02:19:20.583 --> 02:19:26.005]  And the Russian troops would be from Fort Polka, Louisiana, up to Fort Riley, Kansas, where they...
[02:19:26.445 --> 02:19:31.246]  And I've got a copy of that publicly in the newspaper, and now today it's happening 50 years later.
[02:19:31.266 --> 02:19:32.167]  Let's take these calls.
[02:19:32.467 --> 02:19:33.407]  We're just out of time here.
[02:19:33.747 --> 02:19:34.447]  Great information.
[02:19:34.467 --> 02:19:35.568]  He's right on target, folks.
[02:19:36.268 --> 02:19:39.228]  I guess that's the birthright of your children now will be to work for the Russians.
[02:19:39.829 --> 02:19:42.309]  Oh, the new KGB chief has come to save us.
[02:19:42.409 --> 02:19:44.150]  Tom in California, you're on the air.
[02:19:44.170 --> 02:19:44.530]  Go ahead.
[02:19:45.143 --> 02:19:46.144]  Yes, good morning, gentlemen.
[02:19:46.284 --> 02:19:48.785]  I was going to stray away from the subject a little.
[02:19:48.825 --> 02:19:51.106]  I just had a question since I have two experts on the line.
[02:19:51.186 --> 02:19:55.408]  Have either of you heard of the National Economic Security and Reformation Act?
[02:19:55.428 --> 02:19:57.049]  And if so, what are your thoughts on that?
[02:19:57.089 --> 02:19:58.709]  Disinformation operation, Dr. Cuddy.
[02:19:58.769 --> 02:19:59.170]  I thought so.
[02:19:59.750 --> 02:20:01.250]  Well, I'll defer to you on that.
[02:20:01.311 --> 02:20:01.611]  Go on.
[02:20:02.511 --> 02:20:03.371]  Okay, anything else?
[02:20:04.012 --> 02:20:04.892]  No, that's all I had.
[02:20:05.973 --> 02:20:10.135]  Yeah, this, oh, the government's really good and secretly gave us all our rights back, Dr. Cuddy.
[02:20:10.455 --> 02:20:10.855]  Thank you.
[02:20:12.564 --> 02:20:13.285]  So you agree with that?
[02:20:14.406 --> 02:20:15.146]  It's ridiculous.
[02:20:16.208 --> 02:20:17.649]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:20:17.689 --> 02:20:18.109]  Go ahead.
[02:20:19.591 --> 02:20:20.372]  Yes, good morning, gentlemen.
[02:20:21.773 --> 02:20:30.983]  To what extent, Dr. Cuddy, are the Fortune 500 companies, to what extent have they thrown their lots in with this New World Order agenda?
[02:20:31.003 --> 02:20:33.505]  Well, you can't be their chairman or CEO unless you're with them.
[02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:34.186]  Go ahead, Dr. Cuddy.
[02:20:35.530 --> 02:20:44.935]  Yeah, they've had to, for 30 years, they've been getting a lot or most of their profits from overseas, and it's the old Stalinist disunion for the purpose of union.
[02:20:45.235 --> 02:20:54.379]  You have to break down national loyalties, and then, according to Cecil Rhodes and Big Neff Brzezinski recently, where he said, we'll have world government, but we have to have a regional approach.
[02:20:54.799 --> 02:20:58.401]  What you do is you'd have NAFTA linked up with the Asian...
[02:21:01.876 --> 02:21:10.128]  Yeah, now we're so dependent on Mexico and Canada, Pan-American Union.
[02:21:10.148 --> 02:21:10.308]  Right.
[02:21:10.588 --> 02:21:13.713]  Now there's so many people across borders, got to merge the Social Security system.
[02:21:13.733 --> 02:21:15.476]  I want to give you a local example.
[02:21:16.016 --> 02:21:21.938]  If they can deindustrialize the snow factories, people are going to accept being prison guards as their job.
[02:21:21.958 --> 02:21:23.899]  They're going to accept being tattletale squads.
[02:21:24.279 --> 02:21:25.579]  They're going to accept this.
[02:21:25.899 --> 02:21:31.661]  They say America's going to be a police state enslavement grid that produces propaganda for the world.
[02:21:31.701 --> 02:21:34.682]  They said that's what America will be, the armpit of Satan.
[02:21:34.782 --> 02:21:43.345]  Am I on?
[02:21:45.811 --> 02:22:05.484]  Okay, basically what you have is a push for that through economics, so that under NAFTA you have a lot of factories on the other side of the Mexican border, really making Mexico a 51st state without rules and regulations, and opening up that border towards a flood, and as they call it, reconquista of the Southwest.
[02:22:05.904 --> 02:22:09.106]  And so that way you break down the nation of the United States,
[02:22:09.648 --> 02:22:16.750]  And economics and your job and you're willing to have lower wages becomes more important to you than old-fashioned patriotism.
[02:22:16.770 --> 02:22:26.014]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:22:26.534 --> 02:22:27.694]  Thanks for joining us, Dr. Cuddy.
[02:22:27.714 --> 02:22:28.714]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:22:29.075 --> 02:22:29.435]  Thank you.
[02:22:29.695 --> 02:22:30.095]  Stay with us.
[02:23:05.390 --> 02:23:06.291]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.771 --> 02:23:08.372]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.313 --> 02:23:11.995]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.467 --> 02:23:19.371]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:23:19.591 --> 02:23:25.037]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:23:25.297 --> 02:23:25.858]  Ideal for 888-803-4438.
[02:23:25.878 --> 02:23:27.159]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:23:38.915 --> 02:23:44.962]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:23:45.563 --> 02:23:48.566]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:50.888 --> 02:23:52.630]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[02:23:55.213 --> 02:23:56.695]  And we're hooked up with the folks at Genesis.
[02:23:56.755 --> 02:23:58.437]  And rarely does my little...
[02:23:59.125 --> 02:24:01.428]  Stereo line cut out to them right there at the end.
[02:24:01.468 --> 02:24:07.796]  It was Cuddy basically bringing us out of break and I barely got back on in time to take us out of that little segment there.
[02:24:07.816 --> 02:24:09.177]  But good job getting me hooked back up.
[02:24:10.379 --> 02:24:10.940]  What a weird...
[02:24:12.199 --> 02:24:13.460]  Electronic stuff on my end.
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:17.283]  We've got a lot of callers, and I want to go to your calls.
[02:24:17.543 --> 02:24:18.964]  We've got some open lines.
[02:24:19.004 --> 02:24:21.406]  The toll-free number to join me on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:21.426 --> 02:24:21.466]  800-259-9231.
[02:24:21.486 --> 02:24:24.988]  I also want to run through some of the headlines and give you my analysis of that, my comments.
[02:24:33.067 --> 02:24:33.747]  I get upset.
[02:24:33.968 --> 02:24:35.388]  I feel threatened by the globalists.
[02:24:35.428 --> 02:24:36.669]  They are destroying America.
[02:24:36.709 --> 02:24:38.090]  They are setting up a heller system.
[02:24:38.350 --> 02:24:40.111]  They are doing all these crazy things.
[02:24:40.451 --> 02:24:41.832]  They are bringing in foreign troops.
[02:24:41.852 --> 02:24:43.253]  They are building prisons everywhere.
[02:24:43.513 --> 02:24:44.814]  They are getting rid of the Bill of Rights.
[02:24:44.854 --> 02:24:46.255]  They are funding terrorists.
[02:24:46.275 --> 02:24:47.536]  They are shipping in drugs.
[02:24:47.556 --> 02:24:48.776]  They are doing all this.
[02:24:50.397 --> 02:24:52.519]  They are coming after everything we've got.
[02:24:52.759 --> 02:24:54.080]  And it makes me very angry.
[02:24:54.580 --> 02:24:56.061]  I said that I would plug...
[02:24:57.572 --> 02:25:04.838]  Dennis Cuddy's phone number, Dr. Cuddy's phone number to get his fine books again, and I didn't get a chance to do that in the last segment, so here it is, 1-888-891-3300, 888-891-3300.
[02:25:04.878 --> 02:25:06.759]  He really has written some great books.
[02:25:15.894 --> 02:25:22.316]  Well, we're about to go to Michael in Rhode Island and others, but before I do that, let me just mention some of the news that's coming up.
[02:25:22.676 --> 02:25:26.177]  Halliburton, Iraq contract expands and no bids allowed.
[02:25:26.658 --> 02:25:28.638]  Surprise, surprise, this time over the oil.
[02:25:29.098 --> 02:25:32.059]  Hurl told investors they can profit from war before the war.
[02:25:32.079 --> 02:25:36.401]  So they're going into North Korea, Iraq, all of this, how to make money.
[02:25:36.501 --> 02:25:37.241]  I mean, this is just...
[02:25:38.010 --> 02:25:46.074]  The ultimate of insider trading and manipulation and conflict of interest, just enraging corruption right out in the open.
[02:25:47.754 --> 02:25:50.896]  Again, Halliburton contract goes beyond fires, now into oil.
[02:25:51.036 --> 02:25:53.317]  Army Corps expands on Halliburton.
[02:25:53.777 --> 02:25:56.198]  Americans debating the world of empire.
[02:25:56.218 --> 02:26:00.720]  And we're going to be a world empire, but slaves of that empire.
[02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:04.922]  Also, Knight Ritter newspapers say neocon new world order.
[02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:08.431]  Iraq, U.S.
[02:26:08.571 --> 02:26:23.285]  reconstructing Ba'ath units, the most vicious Ba'ath CIA tortures, those trained in the U.S., all of Saddam's top henchmen, except for a few titular head, goat, sacrificial lambs, are going to be put back in control.
[02:26:24.767 --> 02:26:28.350]  The people will be totally enslaved and genocided by this system.
[02:26:28.470 --> 02:26:29.211]  That's the plan.
[02:26:29.251 --> 02:26:30.252]  Kill the Muslims.
[02:26:30.894 --> 02:26:31.574]  We're good to go.
[02:26:31.594 --> 02:26:33.115]  We're good to go.
[02:27:01.238 --> 02:27:03.479]  Now I'll be more arrested, maybe do a better job on the radio.
[02:27:04.419 --> 02:27:06.820]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[02:27:07.781 --> 02:27:20.306]  And let me tell you, it is an amazing film, two hours and 37 minutes long, jam-packed with other examples of government-sponsored terrorism, not 9-1-1.
[02:27:20.326 --> 02:27:24.988]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny covers that, Masters of Terror covers that, The Book, Descent into Tyranny covers it.
[02:27:25.718 --> 02:27:26.499]  Excellent works.
[02:27:26.519 --> 02:27:27.600]  You need to get them if you haven't.
[02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:28.481]  You need to get those first.
[02:27:28.521 --> 02:27:35.049]  But now I have Police State 3 Total Enslavement, and it just runs the gamut.
[02:27:35.410 --> 02:27:44.120]  The cashless society, the torture, the world plan, what the globalists are doing, how they're brainwashing us, how they control white slavery rings.
[02:27:45.309 --> 02:27:45.829]  We're good to go.
[02:27:45.869 --> 02:27:46.149]  I think?
[02:28:05.189 --> 02:28:05.409]  Both.
[02:28:05.489 --> 02:28:10.071]  I mean, there's more information in ten minutes of this video than in half the Patriot videos you see out there.
[02:28:10.091 --> 02:28:13.812]  And it's all documented and so professionally produced.
[02:28:13.852 --> 02:28:18.474]  So it's 2595 police state three total enslavement.
[02:28:18.874 --> 02:28:19.854]  And I have police state 2000.
[02:28:19.915 --> 02:28:21.175]  What a classic.
[02:28:21.195 --> 02:28:22.335]  What a wake-up call.
[02:28:23.356 --> 02:28:25.617]  Those imaginary black helicopters attacking Texas.
[02:28:25.957 --> 02:28:26.657]  The FEMA camps.
[02:28:26.697 --> 02:28:28.018]  The troops trying to take your guns.
[02:28:28.638 --> 02:28:29.578]  I have the takeover.
[02:28:29.638 --> 02:28:30.759]  Government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:28:30.799 --> 02:28:31.479]  Provocateurs.
[02:28:33.135 --> 02:28:34.877]  The takeover of the schools, all of it.
[02:28:34.897 --> 02:28:35.977]  I can't describe what's in these.
[02:28:35.997 --> 02:28:37.218]  They just take too much time.
[02:28:38.599 --> 02:28:41.520]  You can get all three of the Police State videos for $60.
[02:28:41.580 --> 02:28:43.562]  That's an $18 discount.
[02:28:43.582 --> 02:28:47.704]  We knock off $5.95 off each one when you get three or more.
[02:28:48.224 --> 02:28:50.546]  I got nine films now we're offering.
[02:28:50.586 --> 02:28:52.147]  We have a nine-tape special, too.
[02:28:53.007 --> 02:28:56.069]  Get Police State 3, Total Enslavement,
[02:28:56.977 --> 02:28:58.439]  It is a scholarly work.
[02:28:58.619 --> 02:29:00.242]  It is encyclopedic.
[02:29:00.362 --> 02:29:01.443]  It is well done.
[02:29:01.523 --> 02:29:02.485]  It is scary.
[02:29:02.545 --> 02:29:03.486]  It'll wake people up.
[02:29:04.748 --> 02:29:06.310]  Police state three total enslavement.
[02:29:06.390 --> 02:29:10.716]  I'm begging those of you that have access to TV shows or know folks that do, get it, air it.
[02:29:11.317 --> 02:29:13.059]  You know, an hour a week until you get it aired.
[02:29:13.219 --> 02:29:14.100]  Get it out to people.
[02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:16.483]  Make copies of it for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:29:17.003 --> 02:29:20.988]  Get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:29:21.448 --> 02:29:22.169]  Don't wait.
[02:29:22.690 --> 02:29:24.151]  Call, order it today.
[02:29:24.171 --> 02:29:24.232]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:29:31.596 --> 02:29:47.967]  That's 888-253-3139, or Infowars.com or net, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:29:50.128 --> 02:29:53.430]  I poured a lot into this film, and the editor, Mason Collier, really did.
[02:29:54.911 --> 02:29:55.672]  We spent about...
[02:29:56.443 --> 02:30:07.885]  Four months on this video, and I'm talking... I didn't talk about it on air, but many days I'd be on radio talk show interviews until 3 in the morning, getting off, mason work, some days 18 hours a day.
[02:30:08.485 --> 02:30:09.685]  We got this video done.
[02:30:09.825 --> 02:30:10.825]  It is powerful.
[02:30:11.466 --> 02:30:12.746]  So 1-888-253-3139.
[02:30:12.946 --> 02:30:16.626]  You've got to see it to know what's in it.
[02:30:17.267 --> 02:30:21.347]  Let's talk to Michael in Rhode Island, a WALE listener, 50,000 watt blowtorch.
[02:30:21.647 --> 02:30:22.607]  Go ahead, you're on the air, sir.
[02:30:22.627 --> 02:30:23.748]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[02:30:23.988 --> 02:30:24.508]  Pretty good.
[02:30:24.528 --> 02:30:25.488]  Sound like you're...
[02:30:26.445 --> 02:30:28.867]  Exposed New World Order very well today with Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[02:30:29.227 --> 02:30:30.748]  Man, that was some scary stuff, wasn't it?
[02:30:30.768 --> 02:30:32.509]  Yeah, I've been following his stuff for a while.
[02:30:32.549 --> 02:30:35.632]  He writes for WorldNetDaily every once in a while and I think Newsmax.com.
[02:30:38.013 --> 02:30:44.378]  But anyway, the reason I'm calling is for our island listeners that may just be tuning in to you, I was reading in the Providence Journal today.
[02:30:44.478 --> 02:30:49.922]  Now you've been talking about how in England they're going to have the satellite tracking chips in the car and they're going to charge you to drive down the roads.
[02:30:50.542 --> 02:30:51.103]  Who said that?
[02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:54.031]  You were saying, in England, they get the satellite?
[02:30:54.312 --> 02:30:56.933]  Well, they started it, they called for it, now they're doing it.
[02:30:57.313 --> 02:31:01.256]  A bunch of states, I had the federal board guy on three years ago.
[02:31:01.696 --> 02:31:05.478]  The plan is, they're going to collapse state governments, claim there's no money.
[02:31:05.538 --> 02:31:11.062]  The feds will say, oh, and they do have plenty of money in their comprehensive annual financial reports, a double set of books.
[02:31:11.642 --> 02:31:16.065]  The CAFRs, that's the name of the comprehensive annual financial report acronym.
[02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:19.522]  They're going to come out, and this is their plan.
[02:31:19.542 --> 02:31:21.764]  They're going to say, we've got to do this federally with the state.
[02:31:21.784 --> 02:31:23.265]  It federalizes the state fully.
[02:31:23.686 --> 02:31:26.368]  They'll tax you with a satellite tracker box for your car.
[02:31:26.628 --> 02:31:27.869]  The interface is already in there.
[02:31:27.909 --> 02:31:28.289]  Go ahead.
[02:31:28.530 --> 02:31:42.161]  Yeah, well, they've prepared the public for that right now in Rhode Island, because there was an article today in the Journal about that, talking about how before we couldn't do it, but now we have the E-ZPass system to stop the congestion in the roads.
[02:31:43.292 --> 02:31:48.137]  We're going to be installing, you know, they didn't say it's a satellite thing, but they're going to be installing.
[02:31:48.277 --> 02:31:49.818]  Well, E-ZPass can charge you.
[02:31:50.079 --> 02:31:50.919]  They just put them up.
[02:31:51.620 --> 02:31:52.741]  Take San Francisco.
[02:31:52.781 --> 02:31:53.602]  They're already implementing it.
[02:31:53.622 --> 02:31:54.223]  They always do.
[02:31:55.344 --> 02:31:58.907]  They put E-ZPass first to use the toll booths and the Golden Gate.
[02:31:59.968 --> 02:32:02.871]  Now they say you've got to have E-ZPass, whether you drive that or not.
[02:32:02.971 --> 02:32:04.252]  It's a law in the city.
[02:32:05.013 --> 02:32:06.134]  No one, of course, will contest it.
[02:32:07.330 --> 02:32:12.052]  Now they put E-ZPass readers up all over the city, tracking who you are, where you're driving.
[02:32:12.573 --> 02:32:12.733]  Oh!
[02:32:13.073 --> 02:32:21.097]  And now they say, we may start charging you, depending on how much you drive, the E-ZPass will tell us by, you know, the points you cross and what you do.
[02:32:21.557 --> 02:32:23.338]  So, yeah, they're going to start with tracker chips.
[02:32:24.239 --> 02:32:26.380]  And, look, it's the same thing.
[02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:30.741]  I remember being in Kansas when I made my first film, America Destroyed by Design, in 97.
[02:32:31.821 --> 02:32:32.481]  You drive through.
[02:32:32.521 --> 02:32:35.142]  She goes, you don't have K-Tag, the transponder.
[02:32:35.642 --> 02:32:39.283]  It was like 25 cents if you had it, a dollar or something if you didn't.
[02:32:39.303 --> 02:32:40.363]  There's the incentive to get it.
[02:32:40.663 --> 02:32:41.904]  Oh, here's your little tracker tag.
[02:32:41.924 --> 02:32:42.784]  We'll put your name on it.
[02:32:43.732 --> 02:32:44.552]  Yeah, they're doing the same thing.
[02:32:44.572 --> 02:32:47.593]  And I told her, I said, you're going to lose your job, lady, and she thought it was real funny.
[02:32:48.033 --> 02:32:49.513]  Well, same thing with the grocery stores.
[02:32:49.533 --> 02:32:54.334]  They pull out five lanes, three lanes, put in self-checkout, then they put in thumb scanners.
[02:32:54.615 --> 02:32:56.035]  You get used to using that.
[02:32:56.395 --> 02:32:58.355]  Then they pull them all out and make you use it.
[02:32:58.395 --> 02:32:59.056]  That's how they do it.
[02:32:59.096 --> 02:32:59.436]  Go ahead.
[02:32:59.856 --> 02:33:09.058]  Yeah, and I just love the way that I just read that article on Prison Planet in Eugene, Oregon, about the APC going down to the house.
[02:33:09.966 --> 02:33:11.007]  With 50 SWAT members?
[02:33:11.327 --> 02:33:12.028]  Not a house.
[02:33:12.828 --> 02:33:15.510]  They're now raiding entire neighborhoods with armored vehicles.
[02:33:15.830 --> 02:33:17.551]  Yes, that was just loving, as you would say.
[02:33:17.732 --> 02:33:19.413]  Well, you know, they did that in Austin.
[02:33:19.433 --> 02:33:27.298]  They had Army, regular Army, National Guard, SWAT team, didn't find drugs in one house.
[02:33:27.318 --> 02:33:29.680]  This is an old woman, Sandy Smith, no criminal record.
[02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:32.942]  Her husband was a one-hit wonder country singer.
[02:33:32.962 --> 02:33:36.185]  I mean, the most radical thing they've ever done is drink a Lone Star.
[02:33:37.065 --> 02:33:37.966]  They come to their house...
[02:33:39.702 --> 02:33:41.683]  Proops, machine guns, they have a little dog.
[02:33:41.703 --> 02:33:42.543]  The dog growls.
[02:33:42.583 --> 02:33:43.503]  They kick the dog.
[02:33:43.823 --> 02:33:46.064]  The dog's flopping around, blood coming out of its mouth.
[02:33:46.304 --> 02:33:46.964]  They're laughing.
[02:33:47.004 --> 02:33:48.885]  They shove the woman down in the fire ants.
[02:33:50.026 --> 02:34:00.549]  When they don't find drugs, they go to the next-door neighbor's house, pull out his Playboy magazine, make fun of him, load a gun, lay it on the bed, laugh at him, start searching other houses.
[02:34:00.569 --> 02:34:02.010]  They were just ransacking.
[02:34:02.370 --> 02:34:08.392]  And the sheriff got on TV, Margo Frazier, and she said, We no longer need warrants in Travis County.
[02:34:08.432 --> 02:34:09.092]  I have her on tape.
[02:34:10.007 --> 02:34:10.908]  And you know what?
[02:34:10.928 --> 02:34:16.913]  They lost a suit with Sandy Smith because we went out to the TV show and got her attention.
[02:34:17.333 --> 02:34:18.474]  And she sat on air, that's why.
[02:34:18.935 --> 02:34:23.919]  But yeah, tell them about Eugene, Oregon, when tanks and troops raid neighborhoods.
[02:34:23.979 --> 02:34:25.120]  It's all part of the free country.
[02:34:25.260 --> 02:34:26.401]  They don't find any pot.
[02:34:26.782 --> 02:34:29.404]  They got so enraged, they went ahead and arrested the people.
[02:34:30.024 --> 02:34:33.666]  Out of several houses and said, we're going to go ahead and ask that forfeit to you.
[02:34:33.847 --> 02:34:35.688]  We're going to say you committed a crime.
[02:34:35.728 --> 02:34:37.669]  No drugs were found, but we're just going to go ahead and do it.
[02:34:37.869 --> 02:34:40.311]  See, we've now reached maximum evil level.
[02:34:40.331 --> 02:34:40.831]  You understand?
[02:34:41.351 --> 02:34:41.651]  Oh, yeah.
[02:34:41.731 --> 02:34:44.693]  And the scary thing was what one of the police officers said.
[02:34:44.713 --> 02:34:48.155]  He said, the community wants this, and the people in this neighborhood want this.
[02:34:48.716 --> 02:34:49.616]  Nobody wants this.
[02:34:50.057 --> 02:34:50.857]  This guy's insane.
[02:34:50.877 --> 02:34:52.218]  You know?
[02:34:53.177 --> 02:34:55.319]  It's total insanity.
[02:34:55.379 --> 02:34:56.380]  He's got a ski mask.
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:57.480]  He's got a machine gun.
[02:34:57.520 --> 02:34:58.621]  History's repeating itself.
[02:34:58.942 --> 02:34:59.282]  Oh, yeah.
[02:34:59.342 --> 02:35:00.403]  He's on a power trip.
[02:35:00.603 --> 02:35:01.604]  It's total insanity.
[02:35:02.424 --> 02:35:04.086]  It's just crazy, and it's what's crazier.
[02:35:04.106 --> 02:35:04.926]  Well, I have the article.
[02:35:04.946 --> 02:35:09.890]  I mean, imagine tanks and troops and raiding a neighborhood.
[02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:10.951]  This is what they do now.
[02:35:11.772 --> 02:35:13.173]  I've seen articles out of Virginia.
[02:35:14.234 --> 02:35:15.655]  There was an AP article two years ago.
[02:35:15.715 --> 02:35:16.916]  Missouri town searched.
[02:35:16.996 --> 02:35:17.657]  A town of about 2,000.
[02:35:18.277 --> 02:35:19.298]  Every home was searched.
[02:35:19.759 --> 02:35:20.599]  Roads were blocked.
[02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:22.161]  Army was called in.
[02:35:22.281 --> 02:35:22.641]  Troops.
[02:35:23.181 --> 02:35:24.122]  Machine guns.
[02:35:25.943 --> 02:35:27.605]  I mean, this is the new America, folks.
[02:35:27.625 --> 02:35:28.626]  You're just fruits.
[02:35:28.686 --> 02:35:30.067]  This is for the gun confiscation.
[02:35:30.107 --> 02:35:30.547]  Go ahead.
[02:35:30.747 --> 02:35:30.907]  I know.
[02:35:30.927 --> 02:35:31.488]  It's insane.
[02:35:31.828 --> 02:35:33.329]  Another thing I wanted to touch on before I go.
[02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:36.552]  When are you going to have Gene Chapman on the air?
[02:35:37.573 --> 02:35:39.554]  The one assassinating in front of the IRS building?
[02:35:40.535 --> 02:35:41.816]  I need to have him on.
[02:35:41.836 --> 02:35:43.117]  Well, there's a bunch of people that are doing it.
[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:49.103]  Yeah, I've been going to Bob Schultz's meetings and stuff, so I've been keeping up with that for the last three years.
[02:35:49.843 --> 02:35:53.625]  Well, we just interviewed a guy who's in San Antonio on a hunger fast.
[02:35:54.585 --> 02:35:57.767]  Yeah, people are starting to wake up and starting to take action, which I like to see.
[02:35:58.127 --> 02:35:59.788]  Well, let me tell these folks that didn't know.
[02:36:01.409 --> 02:36:11.734]  Troops in black uniforms, armored vehicles in the Army raiding whole neighborhoods and now whole towns, blocking all the roads, coming in your homes without warrants, that's not freedom, okay?
[02:36:12.535 --> 02:36:13.536]  Thanks for the call, Michael.
[02:36:13.596 --> 02:36:14.316]  You have a great day, Alex.
[02:36:14.696 --> 02:36:15.036]  You bet.
[02:36:15.056 --> 02:36:20.159]  And I'm tired of hearing these punks in sports talk radio who will put us down.
[02:36:20.199 --> 02:36:20.619]  I've heard them.
[02:36:20.639 --> 02:36:22.380]  We're getting excited about real politics.
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:24.781]  Well, they're going to scream about football or baseball.
[02:36:25.141 --> 02:36:27.082]  Hey, your football and baseball is fine.
[02:36:27.482 --> 02:36:29.643]  You better care about your family and your country a little bit.
[02:36:30.183 --> 02:36:31.664]  Bill in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:36:31.704 --> 02:36:32.124]  Go ahead.
[02:36:32.144 --> 02:36:35.206]  It's been a while since I talked to you.
[02:36:36.447 --> 02:36:38.688]  I had three questions for you.
[02:36:38.848 --> 02:36:41.208]  One of them, and I'll take my answers off the air.
[02:36:42.088 --> 02:36:44.409]  You mentioned a nine-tape special.
[02:36:45.149 --> 02:36:46.069]  How much is that?
[02:36:46.989 --> 02:36:52.191]  We knock $5.95 off each tape when you get the video.
[02:36:52.211 --> 02:36:53.251]  So they drop down from $25.95 to $20.
[02:36:53.611 --> 02:36:54.171]  Okay.
[02:36:54.191 --> 02:37:03.133]  And so I guess a nine-tape special would be $180, and every dime of that goes to support our operation.
[02:37:03.721 --> 02:37:04.062]  Okay.
[02:37:04.462 --> 02:37:16.474]  Well, you would be saving, let me see, not $42, not, I don't know, you'd save $42 with a seven-tape special, and so it'd be $48, it'd be $54.
[02:37:16.554 --> 02:37:16.934]  It's four, okay.
[02:37:16.954 --> 02:37:18.736]  $54 you'd save getting a nine-tape special.
[02:37:25.281 --> 02:37:43.054]  The other thing on the books that are out there regarding the New World Order, I've tried reading Clinton's mentor, Quigley's book, and it's a little bit too thick, a thousand pages, just a little too hard to get through.
[02:37:43.694 --> 02:37:49.939]  What would you recommend as a good book to try and give to people who are
[02:37:50.757 --> 02:37:52.638]  You know, skeptics, they don't believe it.
[02:37:52.658 --> 02:37:55.320]  They think Bush is a Christian and blah, blah, blah.
[02:37:55.420 --> 02:37:56.701]  I would do this.
[02:37:56.981 --> 02:37:58.122]  This is not a selfless plug.
[02:37:58.142 --> 02:37:59.242]  My book's $12.
[02:38:00.543 --> 02:38:02.324]  It is 230 pages long.
[02:38:02.805 --> 02:38:05.446]  And when we say something, there's a shot of the news article.
[02:38:05.927 --> 02:38:07.487]  A picture of the news article.
[02:38:07.568 --> 02:38:08.468]  I've got your book.
[02:38:08.588 --> 02:38:10.589]  Okay, well, you know what?
[02:38:10.970 --> 02:38:12.951]  We just have a quote from Carol Quigley in the book.
[02:38:13.524 --> 02:38:19.946]  And then if you want somebody that denies it, then go to the library, go to the page, and read what quickly said out of a thousand pages.
[02:38:19.986 --> 02:38:27.289]  There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international network which operates, to some extent, the way the radical right believes the communist act.
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:34.923]  In fact, the network, which we may identify, the roundtable group, has no aversion to cooperating with the communists or any other group and frequently does so.
[02:38:35.003 --> 02:38:42.746]  I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for 20 years and was permitted for two years in the early 60s to examine its papers and secret records.
[02:38:42.766 --> 02:38:47.768]  I have no aversion to it or most of its aims and have for much of my life been close to it for many of its instruments.
[02:38:48.248 --> 02:38:57.692]  I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies, but in general, my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.
[02:38:58.292 --> 02:38:59.192]  That's Quigley, see?
[02:38:59.212 --> 02:38:59.793]  That's in my book.
[02:39:01.253 --> 02:39:01.934]  Anything else, Bill?
[02:39:01.994 --> 02:39:05.055]  Of Dennis Cuddy's books, what would you say would be the best one?
[02:39:05.095 --> 02:39:06.855]  Start with his first one and go forward?
[02:39:06.875 --> 02:39:09.376]  Well, I would say Secret Records of the Globalists is good.
[02:39:09.396 --> 02:39:10.077]  I've read that one.
[02:39:10.217 --> 02:39:11.917]  I've read his 9-1-1 book.
[02:39:11.997 --> 02:39:13.578]  It's not as... It's good.
[02:39:13.618 --> 02:39:14.278]  It's good stuff.
[02:39:15.039 --> 02:39:16.759]  I mean, it's well-written.
[02:39:16.819 --> 02:39:17.640]  It's easy reading, right?
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:18.160]  Pardon me, sir?
[02:39:21.425 --> 02:39:24.067]  His are thin books that are very easy to read.
[02:39:24.087 --> 02:39:26.870]  No, they're about, my book's 230, his books are about 300.
[02:39:27.390 --> 02:39:27.791]  Okay.
[02:39:27.891 --> 02:39:32.955]  But yeah, they're better than a thousand page book written by the globalist.
[02:39:33.075 --> 02:39:47.227]  Well, I like your videos best because, you know, like you said, everybody's, you know, they won't sit down and read a book, they won't sit down and read an article, but you give them a video, you know, they will watch it, you know, or at least get into it.
[02:39:47.387 --> 02:39:49.009]  Same thing of cassettes of this show.
[02:39:49.719 --> 02:39:49.939]  Right.
[02:39:50.099 --> 02:39:55.324]  Which you can get from the network, or you can just go to prisonplanet.com, download the best interviews for free.
[02:39:55.584 --> 02:39:56.945]  We pay for the bandwidth, but you get it.
[02:39:58.567 --> 02:40:02.390]  But download those, burn them on discs, give them to people.
[02:40:03.851 --> 02:40:05.993]  But the films are great because you can make copies.
[02:40:06.073 --> 02:40:07.915]  It's a mini printing press.
[02:40:10.497 --> 02:40:11.157]  Anything else, sir?
[02:40:11.818 --> 02:40:12.478]  Okay, he's gone.
[02:40:12.759 --> 02:40:14.160]  Charles, no, who's up next?
[02:40:16.135 --> 02:40:17.076]  Cliff in Oklahoma.
[02:40:17.096 --> 02:40:17.716]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:40:17.997 --> 02:40:18.537]  Hello, Alex.
[02:40:18.757 --> 02:40:19.198]  How you doing?
[02:40:19.418 --> 02:40:20.078]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:40:20.098 --> 02:40:20.779]  Fantastic.
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:23.041]  Well, I was just calling up.
[02:40:23.421 --> 02:40:28.806]  I'm here from Oklahoma City, and I just wanted to let you know that I've been showing my videos to friends and stuff.
[02:40:29.246 --> 02:40:29.867]  I'm 19.
[02:40:30.948 --> 02:40:39.475]  And, you know, that's another thing that's really important is to be able to get people who are my age to wake up to this stuff because that's where you get most of your energy.
[02:40:39.495 --> 02:40:42.157]  What response are you getting when you show the videos?
[02:40:42.538 --> 02:40:42.818]  Well...
[02:40:43.553 --> 02:40:46.275]  Most of the time, people pretty much agree with stuff.
[02:40:48.317 --> 02:40:56.563]  You know, I really find that people my age are agreeing with this stuff more so than adults who are a little more conditioned to just accept the status quo.
[02:40:56.923 --> 02:40:57.703]  Yeah, I've found that.
[02:40:57.803 --> 02:40:59.725]  Plus, kids have seen the programming.
[02:40:59.745 --> 02:41:00.465]  They know it's true.
[02:41:00.585 --> 02:41:05.129]  Cops are waking up more than the general public because they see my film and go, yeah, I was told that.
[02:41:05.149 --> 02:41:07.971]  To say the Founding Fathers is bad, that's bad.
[02:41:09.441 --> 02:41:10.302]  You got more to add, Cliff?
[02:41:10.342 --> 02:41:10.942]  I'll hold you over.
[02:41:11.202 --> 02:41:12.102]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:12.162 --> 02:41:15.024]  Okay, stay there in Oklahoma City, site of government bombing.
[02:41:15.924 --> 02:41:17.145]  And I'm Alex Jones.
[02:41:17.225 --> 02:41:19.026]  Final segment for this Wednesday edition.
[02:41:19.666 --> 02:41:24.028]  Coming up, the show is from 11 to 2 Central during the day and 9 to midnight Central at night.
[02:41:24.628 --> 02:41:26.569]  A rebroadcast of the daytime show from 1 a.m.
[02:41:26.689 --> 02:41:27.270]  to 4 a.m.
[02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.790]  Stay there, Cliff.
[02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:29.811]  We'll come back to you and others.
[02:41:30.431 --> 02:41:32.592]  I'll have a few final news stories here in the final segment.
[02:41:33.253 --> 02:41:33.773]  Stay with me.
[02:41:36.238 --> 02:41:43.042]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:41:43.402 --> 02:41:44.763]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:41:44.963 --> 02:41:47.165]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:41:47.325 --> 02:41:49.406]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:41:49.686 --> 02:41:54.609]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:41:54.949 --> 02:41:58.992]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:41:59.232 --> 02:41:59.412]  That's 888-2533-139.
[02:41:59.432 --> 02:41:59.873]  Or order online
[02:42:27.014 --> 02:42:27.675]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:42:36.798 --> 02:42:41.300]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:45.742]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:42:46.042 --> 02:42:46.583]  We listened.
[02:42:46.883 --> 02:42:51.865]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:42:52.145 --> 02:42:52.625]  We listened.
[02:42:53.026 --> 02:42:56.047]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:42:56.487 --> 02:42:57.027]  We listened.
[02:42:57.488 --> 02:43:00.349]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.929]  We're good.
[02:43:27.381 --> 02:43:30.362]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:43:30.462 --> 02:43:33.243]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:44:12.767 --> 02:44:13.568]  We're good to go.
[02:44:42.225 --> 02:44:44.407]  All right, my friends, we're about to go back to Cliff.
[02:44:44.427 --> 02:44:45.928]  I'm going to hit a few final news stories.
[02:44:46.088 --> 02:44:54.596]  Real quick, I want to tell you about something that's great, and that's herbal concoctions, basically, are just incredible.
[02:44:55.657 --> 02:44:57.738]  And this is a science that's really been suppressed.
[02:44:57.758 --> 02:45:08.748]  A lot of it is proven and demonstrable and a great source for great herbal remedies and herbal supplies, but to learn what's naturally in your area,
[02:45:10.377 --> 02:45:15.199]  ...is Herbal Healer Academy, and their website is HerbalHealer.com.

[02:45:28.283 --> 02:45:28.963]  Great folks.
[02:45:29.023 --> 02:45:29.684]  Big sponsor.

[02:45:33.945 --> 02:45:35.005]  That's a great thing to have.
[02:45:35.025 --> 02:45:38.026]  Do you know what's in the stuff over the counter?
[02:45:38.987 --> 02:45:39.567]  Not good for you.
[02:45:40.323 --> 02:45:42.092]  Natural pet and livestock products.
[02:45:42.113 --> 02:45:43.118]  That's really good.
[02:45:43.669 --> 02:45:59.641]  Free catalogs and newsletters, naturopathic correspondence programs, home study courses, mortal silver, MSM sulfur capsules, olive leaf extract, vitamin C, natural derived systems, natural detox, the list goes on and on.

[02:46:11.232 --> 02:46:13.332]  We were talking to a caller in Oklahoma.
[02:46:13.352 --> 02:46:14.633]  You were trying to finish up, Cliff.
[02:46:14.653 --> 02:46:15.093]  Go ahead.
[02:46:15.313 --> 02:46:15.613]  He there?
[02:46:15.893 --> 02:46:16.293]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:16.553 --> 02:46:16.793]  Okay.
[02:46:17.273 --> 02:46:32.396]  Well, what else I was going to say is I play guitar, and I've started a band, and we've kind of started talking about some of the stuff that's basically having to do with this type of thing, and I'm actually starting to play some shows.
[02:46:32.436 --> 02:46:34.376]  We've put out a three-song CD.
[02:46:34.396 --> 02:46:37.397]  We're called Behold the Pale Horse, and...
[02:46:38.226 --> 02:46:42.389]  You know, everybody's got a different way that they can go out and help things.
[02:46:42.510 --> 02:46:45.132]  Oh, no, we've got to swarm the globalists like fire ants.
[02:46:45.152 --> 02:46:46.833]  We've got to expose them for what they are.
[02:46:46.853 --> 02:46:50.456]  Big government, wicked people, sadistic control freaks.
[02:46:50.476 --> 02:46:51.297]  We've got to expose them.
[02:46:51.317 --> 02:46:52.598]  They don't have our best interests at heart.
[02:46:52.878 --> 02:46:54.299]  They want to dumb us down and control us.
[02:46:54.639 --> 02:46:55.860]  And I commend you for doing that.
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:57.141]  At every level, we've got to fight them.
[02:46:57.502 --> 02:47:03.226]  Yeah, and I'm actually planning on sending you that CD up to you so you can hear it.
[02:47:03.286 --> 02:47:04.147]  Well, good.
[02:47:05.954 --> 02:47:06.954]  That's fantastic.
[02:47:07.174 --> 02:47:08.895]  That's another thing.
[02:47:09.615 --> 02:47:11.255]  It's also about the globalists.
[02:47:11.315 --> 02:47:14.276]  It's not just about gaining control, getting money.
[02:47:14.316 --> 02:47:15.896]  It's also about destroying culture.
[02:47:16.997 --> 02:47:24.219]  When you can actually go out there and create culture at a local level, whether it's music, art, whatever, that's another thing.
[02:47:24.279 --> 02:47:25.619]  They don't want that to happen either.
[02:47:25.779 --> 02:47:28.380]  No, they destroy us using their counterfeit culture.
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:31.320]  They make all this so-called counterculture stuff.
[02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:33.841]  It's actually the establishment's poison.
[02:47:34.286 --> 02:47:34.746]  That's right.
[02:47:34.846 --> 02:47:36.987]  I mean, you watch MTV, you watch that.
[02:47:37.448 --> 02:47:42.290]  It's training you how to get into an activity that will get you into prison so you can build widgets for them.
[02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:43.251]  Exactly.
[02:47:43.271 --> 02:47:44.751]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[02:47:44.791 --> 02:47:45.492]  Great job, bud.
[02:47:45.512 --> 02:47:46.092]  You keep it up.
[02:47:46.913 --> 02:47:48.954]  Again, Americans debating the world empire.
[02:47:49.054 --> 02:47:55.817]  ABC News, world empire being used more and more often these days to describe America's global role in a new world order.
[02:47:55.877 --> 02:47:57.238]  See, everything's a new world order.
[02:47:57.975 --> 02:48:03.316]  And Halliburton gets now the oil contracts, not just construction, not just $7 million, but even more.
[02:48:03.476 --> 02:48:04.396]  All the oil's theirs.
[02:48:04.456 --> 02:48:05.136]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:48:05.956 --> 02:48:08.797]  And Pearl told investors they can profit from war.
[02:48:08.837 --> 02:48:10.157]  This is now mainstream news.
[02:48:11.177 --> 02:48:12.037]  Iraq, U.S.
[02:48:12.217 --> 02:48:13.478]  resurrecting bath units.
[02:48:13.598 --> 02:48:14.198]  Big deal.
[02:48:14.778 --> 02:48:22.699]  Our government is reconstructing the special paramilitary units of the bath party, the torture teams, everybody that was trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, to run the country.
[02:48:22.739 --> 02:48:25.220]  Again, White House refuses to release September 11th info.
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:26.580]  Knight Ritter News Service.
[02:48:27.378 --> 02:48:34.883]  Bush administration and the Pentagon, nation's intelligence agencies are blocking the release of sensitive information about September 11th terror attacks on the World Trade Center.
[02:48:34.903 --> 02:48:35.464]  They'd better.
[02:48:37.385 --> 02:48:38.526]  It goes on and on.
[02:48:40.267 --> 02:48:41.768]  And it's totally staged.
[02:48:43.570 --> 02:48:45.231]  Oh, there was so much news we didn't get to.
[02:48:45.291 --> 02:48:46.652]  More and more cities are passing.
[02:48:47.634 --> 02:48:51.461]  Pro Bill of Rights, resolutions, a lot of conservative cities are doing it.
[02:48:51.641 --> 02:48:53.504]  I've got one on Infowars.com.
[02:48:54.065 --> 02:48:57.311]  You ought to get to your city council or county commissioners and demand they pass it.
[02:48:58.627 --> 02:49:00.688]  So important to reaffirm the Bill of Rights.
[02:49:00.728 --> 02:49:02.289]  They can claim we don't have any rights.
[02:49:02.569 --> 02:49:03.709]  They're still God-given.
[02:49:04.070 --> 02:49:04.970]  We still have them.
[02:49:05.050 --> 02:49:15.055]  And the Anton LaVey, Christian conservative neocon, the commie cons, will be resisted, will be exposed with their little liberal buddies.
[02:49:15.635 --> 02:49:16.615]  Totally staged.
[02:49:16.935 --> 02:49:17.976]  The people are waking up.
[02:49:18.576 --> 02:49:19.837]  Millions are beginning to fight.
[02:49:20.237 --> 02:49:22.738]  You cannot stop us all, so have no fear.
[02:49:23.018 --> 02:49:24.219]  We shall prevail!
[02:49:26.522 --> 02:49:26.943]  We're good to go.
