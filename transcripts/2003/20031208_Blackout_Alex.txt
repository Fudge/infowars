[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.449]  Thank you very much.
[00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.891]  First, I'd like to thank the Joint Task Force for holding this public comment period, promoting the democratic process.
[00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:09.511]  I do appreciate that very much.
[00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:10.171]  Thank you all.
[00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:11.711]  Thank you all for coming here today.
[00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:15.252]  Actually, before I get into this, I'd like to thank, I believe your name is Ms.
[00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.192]  George, for her comments.
[00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:21.473]  I think she was right on point with what she was talking about as far as what's going on in Congress.
[00:00:21.473 --> 00:00:24.314]  Politics really does need to be put aside.
[00:00:24.314 --> 00:00:25.554]  My name is Michael Caine.
[00:00:26.164 --> 00:00:35.007]  I'm a resident of Nassau County, Long Island, and an American citizen, and that's how I appeal to you all, as an American citizen.
[00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:43.209]  Recently, I've completed a report myself about the blackout based on mainstream news reports, official recognitions, eyewitness accounts.
[00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:52.972]  I love my country very much, and I couldn't bear the thought of this critical line of investigation going unexplored, so every journalist that I contacted chose not to use me as a source.
[00:00:55.905 --> 00:01:02.769]  I've read much of the interim report produced by the Joint Task Force, which was very well done, and I appreciate the report and its findings as well.
[00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:13.894]  I'd like to draw attention, just very briefly, to the five 345 kilovolt power lines that are said to be taken down by trees, and in the report, trees are listed as a common causality.
[00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:24.180]  It seems to me, and I don't have the expertise to deny this in any way, but it seems to me that there are many potential holes in many of the tree causality scenarios in the report.
[00:01:24.688 --> 00:01:32.533]  I can't go into detail on this because I really don't have the time or the expertise either, as you have.
[00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:38.617]  But what I do have the time to detail is a series of issues the Task Force may be unaware of, which is detailed in my report.
[00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:41.638]  I do have copies here for anybody that wants it when this is done.
[00:01:41.638 --> 00:01:48.863]  The first is that there seems to have been no investigation into whether or not electromagnetic pulses played a role in causality in the blackout.
[00:01:48.863 --> 00:01:54.026]  And the only reason that I bring that up is because we know that HAARP was turned on at precisely 4 p.m.
[00:01:54.648 --> 00:02:00.012]  On August 14th, just 11 minutes before the blackout happened.
[00:02:00.012 --> 00:02:06.438]  There was other causalities and things as well earlier, but that's when it all came to head, right around that time.
[00:02:06.438 --> 00:02:13.583]  Now HARP, it's an acronym for the High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, and this is located in Alaska.
[00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:23.171]  HARP does have the capability of producing electromagnetic pulses at frequencies that can cause a localized blackout over long distances, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
[00:02:23.783 --> 00:02:33.351]  The fact that HAARP was turned on at precisely the time in which the blackout seemed to occur cannot be overlooked in order to ensure the credibility of the Joint Task Force finding.
[00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:46.702]  Now, HAARP is primarily sponsored by the Air Force Weather Agency, and I strongly recommend that the Air Force be contacted and ask to disclose records to the Joint Task Force to reveal what HAARP was used for on August 14, 2003 at precisely 4 p.m.
[00:02:46.702 --> 00:02:48.924]  and earlier in that day.
[00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:51.006]  In addition to this, I received a report
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:02.128]  From a friend that at 1pm on August 14th, just three hours before the blackout occurred, the Canadian border was militarized and everyone who crossed was fully searched in the Mohawk River Valley region.
[00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:06.291]  Now, this is odd and I don't know what this was for.
[00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:09.513]  I think that is cause for investigation as well.
[00:03:09.513 --> 00:03:21.021]  In addition to this, at 8pm on August 14th, 2003, I looked up in the sky in Nassau County, where I live, and I saw three gigantic aerosol clouds left by planes.
[00:03:21.607 --> 00:03:28.371]  Over the course of one week, I interviewed half a dozen eyewitnesses to this aerial aerosol spray operation, and was able to confirm two things.
[00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:35.535]  One, the spraying was definitely conducted by planes, and two, whatever was sprayed was low enough for the population to experience an incoming.
[00:03:35.535 --> 00:03:47.602]  I called Lieutenant Colonel Casey Blaney, who's up in Rome, New York, where our NORAD is stationed in New York, and I asked her about this aerosol spray operation that was witnessed by multiple people during the evening of the blackout.
[00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.944]  She asked if it was possible what we saw was contrast, and it's not possible.
[00:03:51.503 --> 00:03:52.404]  Uh, for two reasons.
[00:03:52.404 --> 00:04:01.591]  One, contrails only form at high altitudes, and this is very low, and there was an incoming on the population that I witnessed, and most of those people with me, and that I've interviewed, witnessed.
[00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:09.216]  And two, according to CNN and other mainstream reports, LaGuardia and Kennedy Airports, which are the closest airports to us, were grounded until 8.30 p.m.
[00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:13.359]  that night due to the blackout, and incoming flights were being diverted to other airports.
[00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:20.745]  So there were no more commercial aircraft in the air at the time, which is the perfect time for such an operation to be, have the air free for it.
[00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:26.986]  In addition to all of this, on August 15th, the very next day, the Associated Press announced Determined Promise 03.
[00:04:26.986 --> 00:04:37.134]  Now, this is a national military exercise scheduled to begin in Alaska and Nevada, in which one of the operations would simulate a biological attack of pneumonic plague.
[00:04:37.134 --> 00:04:39.556]  This was just one day after the blackout this was announced.
[00:04:39.556 --> 00:04:46.482]  It was stated that the, uh, that Northern Command, uh, said that had no relation to the blackout in that report.
[00:04:46.482 --> 00:04:50.005]  And that report from the AP is in my report as well for you to review.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:02.849]  Now, to go back over a year ago, in July of 2002, President Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive 16, which I'll refer to as PD-16.
[00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:09.133]  PD-16 was the secret plan for the United States to wage cyber warfare against other countries' power grid.
[00:05:09.133 --> 00:05:15.378]  Wayne Madsen, who had some 20 years of experience in computer security and data privacy, and a former U.S.
[00:05:15.378 --> 00:05:17.019]  Naval officer, reported this.
[00:05:17.543 --> 00:05:26.330]  Parts of PD-16 were leaked out, but we still do not know the depths of PD-16, and whether there is a provision in it that pertains to North America.
[00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:34.916]  Finally, Tommy Franks, General Tommy Franks recently, in an interview with Cigar Aficionado, said if there's one more terrorist attack that occurs in America, the U.S.
[00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:39.900]  Constitution will be scrapped in favor of a military government.
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.882]  I appeal to the hearts and the minds of the Commission here on this.
[00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:48.213]  Please, I hope that you do read my report and the supporting documentation of it.
[00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:51.275]  I offer it just as a patriotic American for what I witnessed.
[00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:52.616]  I didn't want to do this report.
[00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:54.177]  I'm not a professional journalist.
[00:05:54.177 --> 00:05:56.718]  I saw something and it led me to this investigation.
[00:05:56.718 --> 00:05:58.959]  That's why I appeal to you on this.
[00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:03.122]  And just one final thing.
[00:06:03.122 --> 00:06:06.163]  There's another commission happening right now that I've been following very closely.
[00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:08.344]  I've been working with the family members of the 9-11 victims.
[00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.493]  Uh, the September 11th Advocates, as well as other groups that have been following that commission closely.
[00:06:14.493 --> 00:06:16.774]  It's very unfortunate what's happening in that commission.
[00:06:16.774 --> 00:06:19.495]  It appears that we're not getting full disclosure.
[00:06:19.495 --> 00:06:22.017]  The family members are very, very disappointed in that.
[00:06:22.017 --> 00:06:24.858]  And there's a lot happening around that now.
[00:06:24.858 --> 00:06:34.744]  Uh, that commission appears to already, uh, be, going to be relegated to be insufficiently investigating what happened.
[00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:41.993]  And I would hate for this commission to have that same historical reference.
[00:06:41.993 --> 00:06:48.579]  Again, I appeal to the hearts and minds of the commissioners here to please take note of this and look into this.
[00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:53.143]  And I, again, very much appreciate your time and very much appreciate the report you did.
[00:06:53.143 --> 00:06:53.904]  Thank you very much.
[00:06:53.904 --> 00:06:56.807]  And if any of the commissioners want, I have the report on me right now.
[00:06:56.807 --> 00:06:59.269]  I can hand it to you right now if anybody wishes.
[00:06:59.269 --> 00:06:59.850]  Thank you very much.
