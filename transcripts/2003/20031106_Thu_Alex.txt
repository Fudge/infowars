[00:00:03.096 --> 00:00:07.138]  You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:14.942]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:16.642]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:18.503]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:19.944]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.724 --> 00:00:21.625]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.947]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:30.529]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:45.036]  El Presidente Vicente Fox, who works for the big New York banks, his job to break down the U.S., to flood us with illegals, to roll us in, for the Pan-American Union to threaten us.
[00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:46.737]  We're good to go.
[00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:11.654]  Let's let Clyde and Charles, JQ, and others.
[00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:14.577]  Clyde, finishing up, you were making some statements going on.
[00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:21.082]  Well, I think, Alex, that they're not going to really achieve, per se, the abolishment of state borders, at least as geographic.
[00:01:21.222 --> 00:01:21.963]  Well, it won't matter.
[00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:25.305]  They'll just have regional governorships that order and fund the states.
[00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:26.887]  I understand that.
[00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:37.255]  I think more likely, and I realized this when I worked in the federal bureaucracy starting in the late 70s, I think more likely what they've done, and if you study the history of what is called grant-in-aid,
[00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:45.675]  The factor of what they've achieved is an integrated national system where states are really only administrative units of the national government.
[00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:49.260]  And local governments, really, to a great extent, are pretty much integrated.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.745]  So they can achieve it with financing a state and local government.
[00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:54.348]  And I think the globalists are basically...
[00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:55.302]  We're good to go.
[00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:55.502]  I think?
[00:02:10.976 --> 00:02:15.117]  Has ever, in any type, no federal program has ever been authorized.
[00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:21.198]  And now they're training us with the fires and all the rest of the stuff that, oh, we've got to have the federal help.
[00:02:21.218 --> 00:02:21.678]  Exactly.
[00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:28.039]  I think that's the plan, and then to roll us into all these global treaties and then the world government.
[00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:34.340]  I think there's only going to be really two levels of government left, I feel, in probably a generation or two.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.601]  One will be a world government, and then the national governments that the...
[00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:43.824]  I hear you, Clyde.
[00:02:43.844 --> 00:02:49.848]  Clyde, thanks for the call.
[00:02:49.888 --> 00:02:50.729]  Gotta let you go.
[00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:51.589]  Thank you so much.
[00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.611]  Let's talk to Charles, Louisiana.
[00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:54.491]  Charles, go ahead.
[00:02:56.773 --> 00:02:58.634]  Go ahead and turn your radio off.
[00:02:58.654 --> 00:02:59.174]  Put him on hold.
[00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:03.117]  We'll try to go to Charles here in just a second.
[00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.552]  And we do have some guests coming up, that's why I'm hurrying through the callers as fast as possible.
[00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:09.333]  Let's try to go back to Charles now.
[00:03:09.413 --> 00:03:10.013]  Charles, you there?
[00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:11.194]  How you doing, my friend?
[00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:11.995]  Good, go ahead.
[00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:12.555]  God bless you.
[00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:15.256]  Well, I tell you this morning, I'm really discouraged.
[00:03:15.477 --> 00:03:19.479]  You know, I really thought that this thing wouldn't have went this far.
[00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.882]  They're putting this in our face, rubbing our nose in it, and they think they're getting away with it.
[00:03:26.243 --> 00:03:26.963]  I just don't know.
[00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:30.105]  I have no life because I fight this all the time.
[00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:33.103]  I just don't know what the American people are doing.
[00:03:33.303 --> 00:03:34.324]  We need to do more.
[00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:37.565]  Not you, but the American people need to get out there with ball horns.
[00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:39.246]  We need to shame these people.
[00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:44.988]  We need to do anything we can to take away from these people their authority.
[00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:48.430]  We've got to take the attitude of our forefathers.
[00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:50.531]  What do you think about that?
[00:03:51.573 --> 00:04:19.663]  Well, by discouraged, you mean how openly the states and cities are accepting fake ID cards, issuing driver's licenses to known felons, known illegal aliens, but then they're going to hold citizens to the letter of the law while giving illegals double the tuition that citizens get, setting up a system to destroy our sovereignty and having Vicente Fox throw it in our face and give awards to city leaders that are committing felonies, racketeering to authorize illegal aliens.
[00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:22.446]  Exactly.
[00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:23.827]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[00:04:24.808 --> 00:04:28.570]  And I get so discouraged, Mr. Jones.
[00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.571]  I didn't think it would go this far.
[00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:32.412]  I really didn't think it would go this far.
[00:04:32.432 --> 00:04:34.373]  I thought we would have stopped them in their tracks by now.
[00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:36.294]  Well, it's going a lot further.
[00:04:36.494 --> 00:04:39.636]  And we have stopped them in their tracks at many levels, but we haven't on others.
[00:04:40.097 --> 00:04:43.078]  And look, people like you out there taking action, Charles.
[00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:45.139]  That's what's held them back this much.
[00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.621]  I want to make a comment about Bohemian Groves.
[00:04:49.041 --> 00:04:52.605]  It's a satanic message.
[00:04:53.245 --> 00:04:57.750]  When you first pray it, you'll get depressed if you don't pray about it.
[00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.550]  I tell you what, stay there.
[00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:01.954]  I'll let you talk about Bohemian Grove when we get back to video so you've obviously seen it.
[00:05:02.675 --> 00:05:04.536]  And then we'll go to JQ and others.
[00:05:04.557 --> 00:05:06.198]  We do have a couple guests coming up as well.
[00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:06.599]  Stay with me.
[00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:16.488]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:16.828 --> 00:05:18.188]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:18.408 --> 00:05:20.589]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:22.850]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.052]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:28.392 --> 00:05:32.414]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:32.674 --> 00:05:34.456]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:45.186]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:45.326 --> 00:05:47.228]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:47.448 --> 00:05:51.312]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:52.674]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:56.397 --> 00:06:03.448]  That's 888-253-3139 or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:04.450]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:08.777 --> 00:06:12.840]  We've all heard that garlic has been used for centuries to ward off everything from diseases to demons.
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.722]  What is it about garlic that makes it the most recognized and widely used spice in history?
[00:06:16.982 --> 00:06:17.943]  It's called allicin.
[00:06:18.383 --> 00:06:21.265]  Allicin is the primary active ingredient in fresh crushed garlic.
[00:06:21.606 --> 00:06:27.129]  According to the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry, garlic has only 5,000 micrograms of allicin potential.
[00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:30.732]  Garlimax has only 5,500 micrograms of allicin potential.
[00:06:30.952 --> 00:06:32.913]  But Allimax has 180,000 micrograms of allicin yield guaranteed.
[00:06:36.255 --> 00:06:41.397]  That's why Alamax stands head, shoulders, hips, and ankles above every other garlic product on the market today.
[00:06:41.697 --> 00:06:45.298]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Alamax.
[00:06:45.558 --> 00:06:47.138]  That's 877-817-9829.
[00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:54.341]  Garlic is the number one all-natural, antiviral, and antibacterial spice on Earth, and Allison is the reason.
[00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:55.781]  When you need the power of garlic...
[00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:57.524]  You need the power of Alamax.
[00:06:57.764 --> 00:06:57.985]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:06:58.005 --> 00:06:58.265]  That's 877-817-9829.
[00:06:58.285 --> 00:07:00.209]  And remember, garlic is Allison and Allison is Alamax.
[00:07:08.072 --> 00:07:11.554]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:15.317]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:07:15.417 --> 00:07:19.359]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:25.743]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:26.164 --> 00:07:34.069]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:39.832]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:07:39.972 --> 00:07:43.733]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:45.974]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:07:46.035 --> 00:07:48.216]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:53.378]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:07:53.418 --> 00:07:58.961]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:08:02.122 --> 00:08:06.185]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.090]  Big Brother.
[00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:15.811]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:16.532 --> 00:08:17.633]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:18.293 --> 00:08:19.094]  You want answers?
[00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:20.775]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:25.238]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.598 --> 00:08:27.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:08:28.843 --> 00:08:29.704]  Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.464 --> 00:08:34.366]  Welcome, 8 minutes and 25 seconds into this second hour.
[00:08:34.426 --> 00:08:42.290]  We got Jack McClam coming up in about 25 minutes to talk about some new statistics where police are actually against gun control, 90 plus percent.
[00:08:43.471 --> 00:08:47.573]  And more on Vicente Fox here committing crimes right out in the open.
[00:08:48.863 --> 00:08:57.708]  Giving city leaders awards for racketeering, setting up day labor sites, allowing the illegal aliens to be issued ID cards, or accepting their matricula.
[00:08:57.728 --> 00:09:01.751]  We're going to get Glenn Spencer's take on this from the border.
[00:09:02.591 --> 00:09:03.092]  From the border.
[00:09:03.112 --> 00:09:07.234]  He's down there right now about to launch, or I guess he's already launched a drone.
[00:09:08.175 --> 00:09:16.600]  But I want to ask Glenn to hold just for two minutes, and I'm really honored to have him at the forefront of leading the fight against the open borders in a key area of the fight against globalists.
[00:09:17.216 --> 00:09:19.016]  Real quick, because we held Charles over.
[00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:23.918]  Charles, a listener earlier said, if he got my Bohemian Grove video, would he be able to see what was happening?
[00:09:24.378 --> 00:09:25.338]  You've seen the film.
[00:09:25.358 --> 00:09:28.219]  What's your response to it in two minutes?
[00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:28.739]  Real quick.
[00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:33.920]  Well, I passed out this morning up to 526 tapes of Bohemian Grove.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.361]  And they have a message on that tape.
[00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:40.742]  And if you play it in your house, after you play it, you'll feel a depression come on you.
[00:09:40.762 --> 00:09:41.982]  It's a tectonic tape.
[00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:44.211]  It's actually a ritual.
[00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:48.915]  And what I like about the tape is at the end how you approach George Bush.
[00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:52.859]  You know, when you went to the governor's mansion with the bullhorn.
[00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:55.061]  I'll be doing that today, by the way.
[00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:56.102]  Yeah, thank God for you.
[00:09:56.142 --> 00:10:01.907]  But I think this is one of the most important tapes you can get because this is what holds them up.
[00:10:02.008 --> 00:10:02.908]  This is their belief.
[00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:05.511]  And this tape here is the key.
[00:10:06.252 --> 00:10:07.453]  This is what keeps them going.
[00:10:07.553 --> 00:10:13.775]  Okay, the high priest, I mean, we've got the guy up close in his regalia, do we not?
[00:10:14.315 --> 00:10:14.575]  Yes.
[00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:16.396]  Yes, you see him clearly, yes.
[00:10:18.337 --> 00:10:26.140]  It's a good tape, and you've got to watch it with the attitude that these people do not follow Christ.
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.982]  They've got their own religion, and they've got their own beliefs.
[00:10:30.122 --> 00:10:33.043]  Okay, listen, Charles, I've got to let you go because one Spencer's there, okay?
[00:10:34.037 --> 00:10:34.657]  Thanks for the call.
[00:10:34.677 --> 00:10:36.739]  I appreciate your fine work getting the videos out to people.
[00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:41.661]  Look, just in 30 seconds to finish this up, I heard Gary Brownfield today.
[00:10:41.681 --> 00:10:43.602]  The question was, is George Bush a Christian?
[00:10:43.982 --> 00:10:51.406]  The guy didn't just clap and summon the demon at the Shinto shrine, just have the Muslims for the Ramadan feast and say we all worship the same God.
[00:10:52.146 --> 00:10:53.787]  The guy's a member of Skull and Bones.
[00:10:54.582 --> 00:10:56.924]  The guy is a member of Bohemian Grove.
[00:10:56.944 --> 00:10:59.065]  Folks, just start adding it up.
[00:10:59.546 --> 00:11:00.686]  Two plus two equals four.
[00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:11.034]  Joining me is a premier expert on the open borders and how to fight it, Glenn Spencer from AmericanPatrol.com, joining us from the front lines on the border, out there with his sensors and drones and the rest of it.
[00:11:11.514 --> 00:11:13.876]  Glenn, thanks for joining us from the front lines, my friend.
[00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:27.401]  Glenn, first off, Vicente Fox is going to give the police department and the city of Austin awards for legalizing illegals, which they have no authority to do, accepting their fake matricula cards.
[00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:36.606]  He is here in a seditious fashion attempting from your state of Arizona to Texas to try to get rid of our borders with our traitorous governors.
[00:11:37.567 --> 00:11:38.447]  What do you say to this?
[00:11:39.068 --> 00:11:44.911]  Well, what can you say when the head of a foreign government
[00:11:46.307 --> 00:12:03.039]  Mexico, whose people, according to a Zogby poll of last year, believe, the overwhelming majority believe, that the Southwest belongs to them, that this is their country, and that they have a right to come here.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:14.028]  Now, that's a scientific Zogby international poll, highly respected, and so this is what the people of, according to Zogby, Mexico, think.
[00:12:15.008 --> 00:12:28.101]  Of course, the Mexican government has acted to advance the cause of the reversal of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, so that they can put the Southwest under their jurisdiction.
[00:12:28.142 --> 00:12:32.406]  And you know that I produced a documentary called Conquest of Aslan.
[00:12:33.066 --> 00:12:37.491]  And Aslan, A-Z-T-L-A-N, is what they call the Southwest.
[00:12:38.032 --> 00:12:39.753]  And what they're trying to take back.
[00:12:40.273 --> 00:12:50.215]  And it's the A in MECHA, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, the MECHA groups that are on all of the college campuses.
[00:12:50.235 --> 00:12:51.996]  Hispanic Ku Klux Klan.
[00:12:52.256 --> 00:13:06.140]  Yeah, Hispanic Ku Klux Klan, who say, for the race, everything, for everybody else, nothing, which was one of the reasons Cruz Bustamante was soundly trounced out here in the recall of Gray Davis.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:18.428]  Because he refused, refused to renounce these racist... But again, it doesn't matter because Arnold's going to allow him to issue the ID cards next week to the millions of illegals.
[00:13:18.928 --> 00:13:20.029]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:32.658]  And that's why I reserved the website recallterminator.org because the time may come in a few months when it's legal.
[00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:33.598]  You're so smart to get that.
[00:13:33.718 --> 00:13:34.419]  You're so smart.
[00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:35.805]  Oh, yeah.
[00:13:35.845 --> 00:13:37.547]  RecallTerminator.org.
[00:13:38.388 --> 00:13:41.871]  We're going to dust that off here in about four to five months.
[00:13:42.471 --> 00:13:46.955]  You have to wait six months before trying to recall him.
[00:13:47.716 --> 00:13:56.323]  But at the same time, coming back to the issue of Mecha, this Cruz Bustamante, who is the lieutenant governor of California, was a member of that group.
[00:13:56.904 --> 00:13:59.846]  And this issue was raised during the recall campaign.
[00:13:59.886 --> 00:14:00.387]  And he was asked...
[00:14:01.187 --> 00:14:13.397]  For folks that don't know, you have video, we have video of them at 4th of July parades with colored posters with blonde-haired, blue-eyed people's heads cut off where they say we're going to kill all whites.
[00:14:14.197 --> 00:14:14.818]  That's right.
[00:14:15.038 --> 00:14:25.166]  You have, you know, CDs out, okay, featuring people holding a head of a white man.
[00:14:26.447 --> 00:14:28.891]  By the head, you know, his head severed.
[00:14:30.273 --> 00:14:41.188]  And this is this major group down there, the CD for this Hispanic or Mexican rap group.
[00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:50.059]  But coming back to this, yes, the Mexican president is here advancing the invasion of the United States.
[00:14:50.239 --> 00:14:51.460]  He is an enemy?
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.341]  He is an enemy general.
[00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:57.024]  He is an enemy nation advancing the cause of conquest.
[00:14:57.664 --> 00:15:03.626]  And these suckers who are falling in line with him are now being rewarded.
[00:15:04.047 --> 00:15:07.868]  Well, it's clear, Glenn, that these are orders from New York and D.C.
[00:15:07.988 --> 00:15:11.649]  for the Pan-American Union, Union of American States, to break down America.
[00:15:11.669 --> 00:15:13.330]  Well, there's no question about it.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:30.408]  But the thing is, while these power elite are sacrificing the United States on the altar of globalism, Mexico is chuckling and saying, well, while you're at that, we'll just take this part back.
[00:15:31.349 --> 00:15:35.171]  Mexico is the last nation that believes in globalism.
[00:15:35.212 --> 00:15:43.238]  Well, Glenn, I know from the state police that they can hear everything I'm saying on the bullhorn as they have dinner in there tonight.
[00:15:43.258 --> 00:15:44.539]  I've done it in the past.
[00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:52.125]  What should I say to Perry and Fox when I'm bullhorning them as I'm at dinner with them tonight with a bullhorn?
[00:15:53.146 --> 00:15:56.908]  Well, first of all, okay, this is not Aslan.
[00:15:56.929 --> 00:15:59.931]  This is America, all right?
[00:16:01.188 --> 00:16:07.915]  Mexico, end the corruption and build your own country, right?
[00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:13.240]  And the reason that the Mexicans are so poor is that Mexico is so corrupt.
[00:16:13.741 --> 00:16:17.385]  And that includes Fox and all of his cronies.
[00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:20.588]  It's listed as the second most corrupt country in the world.
[00:16:21.348 --> 00:16:22.869]  And then give them dual citizenship.
[00:16:42.157 --> 00:16:46.700]  And dual citizenship for them, but not for us.
[00:16:47.221 --> 00:16:50.703]  It's a one-way street to the end of the United States.
[00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:52.905]  Well, Glenn, you lived in Southern California.
[00:16:52.965 --> 00:16:54.386]  You worked with the Native American groups.
[00:16:54.426 --> 00:16:56.087]  You now live in Arizona fighting this.
[00:16:56.147 --> 00:16:56.327]  Right.
[00:16:56.607 --> 00:17:05.553]  The Mexican police will beat you up, grab your wife, rob you blind, kill you if they catch you sneaking in, but then we're supposed to be so nice and sweet.
[00:17:06.014 --> 00:17:06.794]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:17:06.854 --> 00:17:07.675]  If they catch you...
[00:17:08.135 --> 00:17:16.221]  Doing anything illegal, or even if they think that you're probably doing something illegal, you have no rights in Mexico.
[00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:18.382]  You have no rights whatsoever.
[00:17:19.683 --> 00:17:24.466]  It is an incredible betrayal of the American people, and it's been going on for a long time.
[00:17:24.486 --> 00:17:26.127]  You know, I went yesterday.
[00:17:26.227 --> 00:17:34.493]  I drove three hours from where I am here on the border to Phoenix, Arizona, to protest Fox's visit, but I didn't get there.
[00:17:34.793 --> 00:17:35.093]  I think.
[00:18:00.828 --> 00:18:02.210]  We're good to go.
[00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.450]  I think?
[00:18:13.167 --> 00:18:19.450]  While Fox was visiting in Phoenix, and all of these dead people lying around, and these crazy Mexicans.
[00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:26.573]  And then he came up to Phoenix and suggested that the real threat to the Mexicans were so-called vigilantes.
[00:18:27.033 --> 00:18:28.714]  I mean, how would the Americans do?
[00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:34.237]  Here are dead Mexicans lying in the middle of the freeway, killed by other Mexicans, no doubt.
[00:18:34.957 --> 00:18:39.339]  And he's up there suggesting that it is Americans who are the real threat.
[00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:41.300]  I mean, this has got to be...
[00:18:42.441 --> 00:18:43.581]  Alice in Wonderland.
[00:18:43.862 --> 00:18:45.683]  This has got to be the Mad Hatter.
[00:18:46.164 --> 00:18:48.686]  What are the American people going to wake up to?
[00:18:48.706 --> 00:18:50.467]  What the hell is really going on?
[00:18:50.507 --> 00:18:51.448]  Pardon my French.
[00:18:51.568 --> 00:18:56.652]  Glenn, Glenn, 80-plus percent of Americans in polls are against what's happening.
[00:18:56.973 --> 00:19:00.756]  But again, the Republicans and the Democrats have got their, quote, solution.
[00:19:01.036 --> 00:19:06.701]  That's blanket amnesty guest worker program to legalize all those that are here and legalize whoever can get here.
[00:19:07.101 --> 00:19:08.042]  This is outrageous.
[00:19:08.722 --> 00:19:09.704]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:09.764 --> 00:19:13.848]  I was just on the phone this morning with Bill King, a former chief U.S.
[00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:19.896]  Border Patrol agent, the man that ran the last amnesty program in 1987 for the INS.
[00:19:20.376 --> 00:19:24.902]  And he said, Glenn, if there's another blanket amnesty, it'll cover half of Mexico.
[00:19:25.762 --> 00:19:27.984]  With fraud and chain migration.
[00:19:28.044 --> 00:19:30.765]  You will lose your country.
[00:19:30.825 --> 00:19:32.807]  This will no longer be a sovereign nation.
[00:19:33.287 --> 00:19:34.908]  Anybody will be able to come in here.
[00:19:35.448 --> 00:19:36.469]  So this is the battle.
[00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:39.130]  It's the battle over the sovereignty of the United States.
[00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.652]  It's the battle over the control of our future.
[00:19:42.192 --> 00:19:44.453]  And you know, Winston Churchill said it best.
[00:19:44.493 --> 00:19:49.016]  He said, victory goes to those who feel deepest and feel longest.
[00:19:49.376 --> 00:19:52.198]  And we have to continue this battle as long as it takes.
[00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:55.481]  All right, AmericanPatrol.com, you're there in the desert.
[00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:57.783]  Have you launched your surveillance drone yet?
[00:19:57.843 --> 00:19:59.684]  We are just about ready to launch it.
[00:19:59.724 --> 00:20:05.729]  We're doing some adjustments to the GPS autopilot right now.
[00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:07.111]  And we'll be flying him shortly.
[00:20:07.131 --> 00:20:07.491]  Stay there.
[00:20:10.945 --> 00:20:13.165]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:20:13.606 --> 00:20:17.947]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:20:18.227 --> 00:20:24.028]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:20:24.268 --> 00:20:28.329]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:20:28.609 --> 00:20:34.250]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.971]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:42.592]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[00:20:42.712 --> 00:20:45.392]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:20:45.732 --> 00:20:48.033]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:20:48.433 --> 00:20:52.054]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:20:52.534 --> 00:20:58.715]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:00.155]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:21:00.496 --> 00:21:00.816]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:01.016]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:09.622 --> 00:21:20.366]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:28.088]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:28.348 --> 00:21:29.129]  We're good to go.
[00:21:44.324 --> 00:21:48.228]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:21:48.268 --> 00:21:50.169]  The water level is always visible.
[00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:56.275]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:21:56.535 --> 00:22:00.298]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:00.378 --> 00:22:01.059]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:10.888 --> 00:22:11.389]  We're good to go.
[00:22:11.409 --> 00:22:11.569]  I think?
[00:22:24.887 --> 00:22:25.467]  We're good to go.
[00:22:41.758 --> 00:22:42.138]  We're good to go.
[00:22:42.178 --> 00:22:42.738]  We're good to go.
[00:23:08.807 --> 00:23:14.052]  It's here, and Ted Anderson from Midas Resources wants to be sure you call right now and get yours today.
[00:23:14.452 --> 00:23:16.935]  It's the 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values.
[00:23:17.195 --> 00:23:23.020]  I love going to all the big gun shows, and now I can buy with the comfort of knowing exactly what that old Winchester is really worth.
[00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:29.026]  Armed with the 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values makes you more knowledgeable and makes gun collecting more profitable.

[00:23:40.357 --> 00:23:45.062]  The 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values contains nearly 1 million words of text.
[00:23:45.383 --> 00:23:50.568]  No other book even comes close and most of the information in this publication is not available anywhere else.
[00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:57.392]  Take the guesswork out of your next gun purchase by calling Midas Resources and ordering your copy of the Blue Book of Gun Values today.
[00:23:57.592 --> 00:23:59.754]  They're only $34.95 plus shipping.
[00:23:59.914 --> 00:24:00.614]  So call now, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:00.634 --> 00:24:01.034]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:01.054 --> 00:24:02.635]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:24.452]  We've got Jack McClam coming up here in just a few minutes to talk about some key issues.
[00:24:24.512 --> 00:24:25.793]  More on Vicente Fox.
[00:24:26.453 --> 00:24:33.557]  You know, Glenn Spencer, for many years, worked with Native Americans in the Southwest.
[00:24:34.437 --> 00:24:40.720]  He's just a regular guy, and then he found out about the invasion, how racist it was, how it was being funded by the globalists to break the country up.
[00:24:41.281 --> 00:24:42.741]  And you talk about racism, folks.
[00:24:42.761 --> 00:24:43.642]  I've studied Mexico.
[00:24:44.312 --> 00:24:47.734]  The Mexican government, the upper classes hate what they call Indians.
[00:24:48.274 --> 00:24:53.116]  They look down on the population that has Indian blood, Native American blood.
[00:24:53.136 --> 00:24:58.199]  It's so pathetic and so corrupt and so sick.
[00:24:58.815 --> 00:25:00.376]  And so evil down there.
[00:25:01.656 --> 00:25:02.777]  And the globalists just love it.
[00:25:02.817 --> 00:25:06.739]  They want to make America like Russia, like Mexico, like China.
[00:25:07.159 --> 00:25:08.100]  We've got to stop it.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.440]  We've got the majority of the people.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.721]  We've got the Constitution.
[00:25:10.981 --> 00:25:11.782]  We're in the right.
[00:25:12.262 --> 00:25:16.324]  But George Bush has said he's going to target Tom Tancredo to get him out of office.
[00:25:16.364 --> 00:25:18.385]  They targeted Senator Bob Smith, got him out of office.
[00:25:18.745 --> 00:25:22.887]  They're going after people that are real conservatives and love America.
[00:25:23.287 --> 00:25:28.110]  Glenn Spencer, you're out there on the border about to launch a drone to surveil and shoot video of all these illegals.
[00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.550]  You've done this many times.
[00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.271]  You've got your sensors out there in the desert.
[00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:34.692]  What else is going on that we should know about?
[00:25:35.532 --> 00:25:41.593]  Well, you know, I was with Tom Tancredo last Saturday at a rally for him, and I was one of the warm-up speakers.
[00:25:42.934 --> 00:25:53.276]  What's going on also is our drones, which we developed ourselves and programmed the autopilots and did it very cheaply.
[00:25:53.916 --> 00:25:55.757]  The Department of Defense found out about them.
[00:25:55.777 --> 00:25:56.677]  I don't know if I told you this.
[00:25:57.751 --> 00:25:58.971]  Yeah, I saw it in the paper.
[00:25:59.632 --> 00:26:05.753]  Yeah, they sent their engineers out there, and they couldn't believe that we could do what we're doing for what we're doing it.
[00:26:05.773 --> 00:26:12.155]  And now it looks as if there's a pretty good chance, and they won't interfere with our work down here, and we've made sure of that.
[00:26:12.756 --> 00:26:20.918]  But there's a pretty good chance that in the not-too-distant future, our border hawks are going to be over in the Middle East protecting our troops.
[00:26:23.552 --> 00:26:30.901]  And again, for the price of what you've done compared to these million-dollar systems, you're getting better response, showing the power of the people.
[00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:32.490]  Absolutely.
[00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.311]  We just went out there and did to solve the problem.
[00:26:35.891 --> 00:26:37.512]  A lot of Americans helped us out.
[00:26:38.372 --> 00:26:41.874]  And we said, hey, we can do this cheaply and we can do this effectively.
[00:26:41.914 --> 00:26:43.854]  And they came out and they couldn't believe their eyes.
[00:26:43.934 --> 00:26:45.415]  What's the range of your drones?
[00:26:46.255 --> 00:26:50.897]  Well, the range is probably 200 miles.
[00:26:52.324 --> 00:26:54.485]  But we don't have an operational range.
[00:26:54.525 --> 00:27:02.848]  We usually use them within 10 miles operational radius to do the job we want them to do.
[00:27:02.928 --> 00:27:11.091]  Now, again, the globalists are trying to preempt you right now by simply coming in and saying, oh, we're just going to legalize everybody.
[00:27:11.976 --> 00:27:13.017]  There's no question about it.
[00:27:13.057 --> 00:27:14.579]  That's what they want to do.
[00:27:14.639 --> 00:27:15.659]  That's the big push.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:23.606]  They're trying to keep the issue as quiet as possible, to slide it through possibly during the holiday season.
[00:27:24.327 --> 00:27:25.008]  I'm not sure.
[00:27:25.048 --> 00:27:27.430]  They're going to try to pull a fast one here fairly soon.
[00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:30.592]  They're up to no good.
[00:27:30.632 --> 00:27:32.154]  You can be sure of that.
[00:27:34.095 --> 00:27:41.480]  And with people like you speaking out, hopefully it'll make a difference because you're speaking for hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, Alex.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.361]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:27:42.401 --> 00:27:42.781]  Millions.
[00:27:42.841 --> 00:27:45.463]  Glenn, just your side alone, it's millions of heads of mind.
[00:27:45.743 --> 00:27:46.764]  Oh, of course.
[00:27:47.004 --> 00:27:47.584]  How do we...
[00:27:49.582 --> 00:27:56.565]  Punish the city officials that are committing felonies and mass racketeering protecting felons, these illegal aliens.
[00:27:57.365 --> 00:28:02.947]  What's happening that we're seeing more and more of, Americans are getting the gumption to run for office.
[00:28:03.468 --> 00:28:11.131]  And they're putting themselves on the line and they're saying, by gosh, I'm going to go out and oppose this person and expose what they're doing.
[00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:13.732]  I know we got a call from people in Utah.
[00:28:13.812 --> 00:28:14.872]  They're very substantial.
[00:28:14.892 --> 00:28:16.793]  They're going after Chris Cannon out there.
[00:28:17.293 --> 00:28:21.736]  What about Warren Hatch, who wants to give more tuition to illegals than citizens?
[00:28:21.816 --> 00:28:22.797]  I mean, look at this.
[00:28:22.837 --> 00:28:26.199]  We've got Republicans who want to give free tuition to illegals.
[00:28:36.011 --> 00:28:44.538]  I will tell you that there are people listening to this who have the resources and the contacts to put the campaign together, and I really encourage them to do this.
[00:28:45.018 --> 00:28:55.066]  And also the grassroots people, people who are qualified to run for office should really seriously consider going against these people who are selling us down the river.
[00:28:55.546 --> 00:28:57.408]  This is how the American system works.
[00:28:58.048 --> 00:29:09.816]  And I know that we should work with whites, blacks, Hispanics, everybody who's a citizen who wants to keep America, America.
[00:29:13.298 --> 00:29:13.458]  In the...
[00:29:42.358 --> 00:29:43.479]  Talk about some key issues.
[00:29:43.519 --> 00:29:44.820]  More on Vicente Fox.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:52.584]  You know, Glenn Spencer, for many years, worked with Native Americans in the Southwest.
[00:29:53.445 --> 00:29:57.287]  He's just a regular guy, and then he found out about the invasion, how racist it was.
[00:30:00.249 --> 00:30:01.169]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.271]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.171 --> 00:30:06.873]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.425 --> 00:30:15.089]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.

[00:30:48.076 --> 00:30:49.117]  Not if, but when.

[00:31:03.455 --> 00:31:04.077]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[00:31:10.425 --> 00:31:13.988]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:31:14.248 --> 00:31:15.669]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:17.570]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:31:17.851 --> 00:31:23.014]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:31:23.395 --> 00:31:27.858]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar and no fluoride.
[00:31:28.178 --> 00:31:36.865]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:31:37.345 --> 00:31:38.446]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:31:38.945 --> 00:31:42.686]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:31:42.966 --> 00:31:49.588]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[00:31:49.928 --> 00:31:53.969]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:56.369]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.

[00:32:10.936 --> 00:32:11.296]  We're good to go.
[00:32:36.519 --> 00:32:37.380]  We're good to go.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.541]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:33:02.561 --> 00:33:07.403]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:33:18.829 --> 00:33:20.350]  Have you ever been to a third world country?
[00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.011]  Have the police shove everybody around, everybody looks down?
[00:33:24.572 --> 00:33:26.293]  Be like that here real soon, folks.
[00:33:27.462 --> 00:33:35.505]  And the majority of our military, already about a third of it, but the majority, they say within another decade, will be illegal aliens from Russia, Czechoslovakia, mainly Mexico, Latin America.
[00:33:35.685 --> 00:33:36.645]  That's mainstream news.
[00:33:37.305 --> 00:33:38.406]  These will be our new bosses.
[00:33:39.186 --> 00:33:40.346]  And this is the new America.
[00:33:40.386 --> 00:33:41.387]  You want to be a peon?
[00:33:41.407 --> 00:33:42.227]  You want to be a slave?
[00:33:42.247 --> 00:33:42.987]  You want to be a serf?
[00:33:43.728 --> 00:33:46.148]  You're going to be one, folks, no matter what color you are.
[00:33:48.329 --> 00:33:49.850]  And it's all financed out of New York.
[00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:50.970]  All right, we're going to go to JQ.
[00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.551]  Then we've got Debbie Morrow coming on for five minutes about Big Berkeys.
[00:33:53.571 --> 00:33:56.612]  Then we've got Jack McClam in the wings to talk about some good news.
[00:33:58.064 --> 00:33:59.285]  This is all really important.
[00:33:59.305 --> 00:33:59.725]  Stay with us.
[00:33:59.785 --> 00:34:01.185]  JQ in Oregon, you've been holding.
[00:34:01.485 --> 00:34:02.006]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:34:02.026 --> 00:34:03.086]  I wanted to get you on air.
[00:34:03.426 --> 00:34:05.047]  Well, sure enough, Alex.
[00:34:05.067 --> 00:34:05.887]  I appreciate it.
[00:34:07.848 --> 00:34:08.868]  Try to keep it short here.
[00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:18.272]  I think what we've been listening to just today alone proves that the government has been taken over by a criminal enterprise.
[00:34:18.292 --> 00:34:21.353]  The mass media has driven...
[00:34:23.263 --> 00:34:26.084]  The process by getting their people elected.
[00:34:26.124 --> 00:34:28.065]  They're part of the criminal enterprise, too.
[00:34:28.125 --> 00:34:28.786]  You'd agree?
[00:34:29.566 --> 00:34:30.026]  Of course.
[00:34:30.487 --> 00:34:30.967]  Okay.
[00:34:31.567 --> 00:34:36.330]  Now, here's a point that everybody has to keep in mind if they're going to remain clear of thinking.
[00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:44.714]  They have to remember that criminal enterprises are incapable of creating law.
[00:34:45.575 --> 00:34:50.938]  So when the issue arises, oh, well, they passed laws to do this, that, and the other...
[00:34:51.477 --> 00:34:54.958]  They're incapable of creating laws because they're criminal enterprises.
[00:34:54.978 --> 00:34:57.559]  Well, it's like passing a law that black people aren't human beings.
[00:34:57.699 --> 00:34:58.940]  You don't have to follow that.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.201]  Well, that's right, because it's not a law.
[00:35:01.241 --> 00:35:07.763]  They don't have legitimacy, and they don't have authority from any source other than the source.
[00:35:08.964 --> 00:35:10.184]  Of their own imagination.
[00:35:10.204 --> 00:35:15.448]  Well, the tyrant source is always the boot, the jackhammer, the trudge and the sword, the gun.
[00:35:15.668 --> 00:35:19.450]  It's force, yeah, but they are not legitimate, so they cannot create law.
[00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:20.711]  This is the point I want to make.
[00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:27.756]  And no judge, no one in government, no police officer can determine whether the government's legitimate.
[00:35:27.936 --> 00:35:30.257]  Only the people can determine that.
[00:35:30.317 --> 00:35:35.821]  That's our job, and our job is also to enforce the law in the final analysis.
[00:35:36.321 --> 00:35:38.002]  I just wanted to bring that up again.
[00:35:38.022 --> 00:35:44.006]  It's something that there's going to be a massive effort to confuse us and say, oh, well, the law has changed.
[00:35:44.046 --> 00:35:47.609]  The law has not changed since they have no authority to create law.
[00:35:47.689 --> 00:35:50.891]  Well, J.Q., last question, and we're going to go to Jack McClam here in a second after Debbie.
[00:35:51.671 --> 00:35:58.536]  But what should I say to Vicente Fox while he's eating dinner with the governor to get rid of the borders and legalize all the illegals?
[00:35:59.737 --> 00:36:05.841]  What should I, when I'm bullhorning him, and I know I've done it in the past, they can hear me while I'm bullhorning them, while they're eating, what should I say?
[00:36:07.578 --> 00:36:08.338]  I don't know, Alex.
[00:36:08.439 --> 00:36:12.621]  I think you're probably better able to judge what you should say.
[00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:15.162]  And I'm sure whatever you say would be true.
[00:36:16.183 --> 00:36:16.523]  All right.
[00:36:16.583 --> 00:36:17.583]  Thanks for the call, J.Q.
[00:36:17.603 --> 00:36:19.324]  We've got Jack McClam coming up in five minutes.
[00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:20.345]  Appreciate him being there.
[00:36:20.465 --> 00:36:23.566]  Really important stuff that he's been covering.
[00:36:24.067 --> 00:36:28.589]  We're going to talk about how the police, the vast majority, are against gun control in a major poll.
[00:36:28.909 --> 00:36:32.331]  Also, the real crime statistics of what guns really do for our society.
[00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:35.834]  And I'm going to get his take on the open borders and Vicente Fox and the rest of it.
[00:36:36.575 --> 00:36:42.461]  But right now, Debbie Morrow, the great lady at New Millennium Concepts, great products, great sponsor.
[00:36:42.762 --> 00:36:46.926]  They've got the new special for the month of November, first time she's been up since the month of November started.
[00:36:47.687 --> 00:36:55.115]  And we're honored to have her because there's all these articles about the Prozac, the Ritalin, the hormones, the birth control pills, the cleaners.
[00:36:55.675 --> 00:37:00.760]  The MBTE, the chloride, the fluoride, all this stuff in most of the water supply.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.562]  Some of it's in all the supplies, but some are really toxic.
[00:37:03.862 --> 00:37:05.564]  You've got to stop drinking that tap water.
[00:37:05.584 --> 00:37:07.005]  You've got to take control of your life.
[00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:09.267]  This is great filtration systems.
[00:37:09.547 --> 00:37:15.572]  This is a great way to take control of your life, to take action, to take away the power the globalists have to poison you through the water.
[00:37:16.493 --> 00:37:17.954]  And it's so important.
[00:37:18.014 --> 00:37:19.015]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[00:37:19.455 --> 00:37:20.756]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:37:20.917 --> 00:37:21.217]  You bet.
[00:37:22.693 --> 00:37:27.619]  We are offering holiday specials now with the holidays around the corner.
[00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:39.974]  We want to be sure that not only can people get water filters for themselves, but rather than give out gifts that sit in a closet all year round or things that people don't need,
[00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:48.118]  We can go ahead and make available some specials so that people can buy more than one system and give them as holiday presents.
[00:37:48.278 --> 00:38:03.323]  Yes, if you're enjoying a big Berkey or a sports Berkey or a shower filter or their solar system, their solar charger, if you're enjoying that, why not give that as a gift to your grandchildren, your parents, your neighbors, to that police officer next door?
[00:38:03.643 --> 00:38:08.165]  Why not share the gift of life and good living?
[00:38:08.205 --> 00:38:09.405]  Debbie, tell them about the new special.
[00:38:10.037 --> 00:38:15.602]  Okay, the holiday specials are either with the Berkey light or without the light.
[00:38:16.323 --> 00:38:32.218]  You can buy two Berkey filtration systems and get the third system for half price, or you can buy four Berkey light filtration systems and get the fifth one absolutely free, plus you get five generic sport bottles with it.
[00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:36.399]  So there's some really good savings there for people who want to go in.
[00:38:36.419 --> 00:38:44.165]  Those are the portable filters, and if folks still just want to replace their old gravity filters with the new super black Berkey elements, they can do that.
[00:38:45.145 --> 00:38:47.727]  You've got potassium iodate in case there's a radiological event.
[00:38:47.767 --> 00:38:52.891]  It fills the thyroid with good iodine so you don't die of that type of number one cause of radiation death sickness.
[00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:59.396]  You've also got the little solar charger that charges the Berkey light, a kind of survival buoy system.
[00:38:59.856 --> 00:39:03.139]  It also charges your cell phones, radios, a great price on that.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.681]  Anything else you want to add, Debbie?
[00:39:05.981 --> 00:39:22.655]  Well, we do have for the people who would like to just buy sport Berkeys and give them out to people, you know, you have lots of trade gifts at work and, you know, at church and things where they're, you know, saying, well, buy a $10 or $20 trade gift for people at these different events.
[00:39:23.234 --> 00:39:26.416]  We are putting the Berkey Sport bottles on special.
[00:39:26.816 --> 00:39:33.800]  You can get four of the Berkey Sport bottles or potassium iodate or mix and match them for $99.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.880]  That is an amazing deal.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:44.406]  You try to buy one of these comparable little sports bottles so you don't have to drink the trash at work or at the game or at church or at the restaurant.
[00:39:44.426 --> 00:39:46.127]  They're $35, $40 in stores.
[00:39:46.227 --> 00:39:48.788]  So four of those for $99, that's quite a discount.
[00:39:49.028 --> 00:39:50.750]  Or you can get 10 for $199.
[00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:56.394]  So, you know, we've really got some good specials going.
[00:39:56.454 --> 00:40:08.545]  And, you know, have people call me, and I'll go over the list and tell them what's available and be sure that we provide what everyone needs, which is good drinking water for themselves and their loved ones.
[00:40:08.945 --> 00:40:09.546]  Absolutely.
[00:40:09.586 --> 00:40:11.828]  That toll-free number to call Debbie, and she's a lady there.
[00:40:11.848 --> 00:40:14.390]  If she doesn't answer, just leave her name and number, she'll call you right back.
[00:40:15.811 --> 00:40:17.571]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:40:19.072 --> 00:40:22.974]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:40:24.454 --> 00:40:26.255]  I bought these systems before they were sponsors.
[00:40:26.635 --> 00:40:28.056]  Now they make them right here in America.
[00:40:28.096 --> 00:40:28.896]  They're even better.
[00:40:29.577 --> 00:40:30.597]  It is so important.
[00:40:30.617 --> 00:40:30.877]  888-803-4438.
[00:40:30.957 --> 00:40:32.678]  And New Millennium Concepts is our...
[00:40:35.679 --> 00:40:40.802]  One sponsor for the six hours of global shortwave outreach every day for five days a week.
[00:40:41.402 --> 00:40:42.683]  Just an amazing service.
[00:40:42.703 --> 00:40:44.183]  They're providing a great product.
[00:40:44.243 --> 00:40:44.884]  Give them a call.
[00:40:45.164 --> 00:40:47.065]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get those specials.
[00:40:47.085 --> 00:40:47.285]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:40:47.305 --> 00:40:48.025]  Thank you, Debbie.
[00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:48.486]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:40:48.826 --> 00:40:49.346]  Have a good day.
[00:40:53.268 --> 00:40:53.508]  You bet.
[00:40:53.548 --> 00:40:53.968]  God bless.
[00:40:53.988 --> 00:40:54.409]  Great lady.
[00:40:54.809 --> 00:40:57.050]  Jack McClam, we got you here for a bunch of issues.
[00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:02.693]  I just love your work, your powerful website, your 20-plus year ministry of waking police and military up.
[00:41:03.113 --> 00:41:08.636]  Most highly decorated police officer and, of course, veteran as well in Phoenix, Arizona history.
[00:41:08.676 --> 00:41:13.759]  Became the most fired when he refused to follow unconstitutional orders and to follow his own.
[00:41:13.819 --> 00:41:14.840]  Jack, just a side issue.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.422]  Because you're here, I know you're into preparedness and taking control of our lives.
[00:41:18.682 --> 00:41:20.403]  How important is clean water, Jack?
[00:41:21.263 --> 00:41:22.364]  Oh, my goodness, brother.
[00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:37.574]  Clean water affects all of us, and I have my water filter up here, and everything comes out of the faucet, even though we pump it right out of the ground in the Great Rocky Mountains up here, it still goes through the filter.
[00:41:38.094 --> 00:41:39.995]  And so it's very important.
[00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:41.450]  We're good to go.
[00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:15.699]  Because it was a green, a red, some kind of an algae that built up on some of our ponds up here that our deer were killed mysteriously and the government says it was
[00:42:18.188 --> 00:42:26.490]  Well, we know there's a lot of biological testing that's been going on for six months all over Oklahoma, spraying, quote, thousands of pounds of bacteria.
[00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:29.291]  That's the daily Oklahoman.
[00:42:29.351 --> 00:42:32.672]  So, again, folks, you want to take control of your life.
[00:42:32.692 --> 00:42:33.612]  You're wondering what you can do.
[00:42:34.032 --> 00:42:37.753]  Take control over the water in your life, and that's why I brought that up to you.
[00:42:37.793 --> 00:42:40.613]  Jack, you have your own talk show.
[00:42:40.633 --> 00:42:42.974]  We've had you on this show dozens of times over the years.
[00:42:44.818 --> 00:42:50.782]  Go over that poll, and I've got it right here in front of me, where the majority of police are pro-Second Amendment.
[00:42:51.543 --> 00:42:55.586]  And then I want to go over the real gun statistics, because this is so central.
[00:42:56.567 --> 00:43:05.974]  Yes, we, for years and years and years, 23 years now, we've been working with volunteer police officers and soldiers here that are very pro-gun.
[00:43:06.014 --> 00:43:10.378]  Now, your police and soldiers, especially your police officers, brother,
[00:43:11.479 --> 00:43:27.829]  You know, when you see the president up there surrounded by police chiefs and some of these officers, these officers, I have friends that have been made to go up and ordered to go up and stand behind the president as if they support anti-gun measures.
[00:43:28.529 --> 00:43:36.934]  And these officers are really ticked that they're forced to go up and stand behind the president like Clinton and others who are anti-gun.
[00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:40.576]  And Bush is too, by the way, but most people don't believe that.
[00:43:41.675 --> 00:43:52.198]  But a large majority of our police, almost 90%, we knew about 10 years ago.
[00:43:52.278 --> 00:44:05.962]  We put out one of our newsletters that cited 88% of the police officers at that time were pro-gun in the hands of the private citizens because it is the police officers that get there always too late.
[00:44:06.703 --> 00:44:10.824]  And we take the reports and clean up the blood and call the ambulance and the morgue
[00:44:11.351 --> 00:44:20.397]  For your children, your wives, and husbands who have been killed in various ways because they had no way to protect themselves.
[00:44:21.017 --> 00:44:38.669]  And every time I interviewed a father whose child had died or his wife had been raped or sometimes even children, every single time as a cop over those years I would interview somebody like this or a woman who's at home with her family and had no way to protect them.
[00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:41.171]  They all said that they wish they'd had a gun.
[00:44:41.891 --> 00:44:44.273]  But, of course, then it's too late.
[00:44:44.914 --> 00:44:47.896]  And so that's why cops are pro-gun to almost 100%.
[00:44:49.217 --> 00:44:51.899]  Because they're where the rubber meets the road.
[00:44:51.939 --> 00:44:53.481]  They're there in the blood and the guts.
[00:44:53.741 --> 00:44:59.265]  They're dealing in reality, not in the little socialist who's never touched a gun.
[00:44:59.545 --> 00:45:00.186]  That's right.
[00:45:00.366 --> 00:45:00.927]  That's right.
[00:45:00.987 --> 00:45:04.950]  It sounds good that we would just outlaw these horrible...
[00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:09.332]  Well, also, we have the statistics of the New Yorks, the DCs.
[00:45:09.352 --> 00:45:13.634]  Those are the areas where you have record numbers of police being killed.
[00:45:28.841 --> 00:45:30.322]  Where they have the gun control.
[00:45:30.522 --> 00:45:32.503]  Cops know that gun control gets them killed.
[00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:33.243]  That's right.
[00:45:33.383 --> 00:45:34.023]  That's right.
[00:45:34.143 --> 00:45:50.330]  And, you know, we also know, cops know, that two and a half million times a year, good citizens who know police officer fears to having a gun protect their own lives and defend their families two and a half million times a year.
[00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:51.831]  That's almost 7,000 times a day with firearms.
[00:45:51.851 --> 00:45:51.931]  Now...
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:04.865]  You know, we have about 200,000 times a year that women protect themselves with a gun against sexual assault.
[00:46:05.826 --> 00:46:15.474]  And by the way, your listeners probably don't know, but citizens shoot and kill probably twice as many, just about twice as many criminals as police do every year.
[00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:43.253]  So we understand the truth and reality, and we were so upset all across these large major cities where we have these programs for the citizens called Block Watch and different things like that, and the police officers have to go in live to the citizens to tell them when the little grandmother puts her hand up at a Block Watch meeting and asks the police officer, Officer, when a guy's coming down my hall with an axe,
[00:46:43.793 --> 00:46:44.713]  What should I do?
[00:46:44.973 --> 00:46:54.395]  And the officer is made to say, ma'am, you go to the magic phone and you pick up the magic phone and you dial and a police officer will magically appear.
[00:46:54.415 --> 00:46:58.656]  Well, I'm going to pick up the magic seven-shot Mossberg and I'm going to unload it.
[00:46:58.996 --> 00:46:59.616]  That's right.
[00:46:59.696 --> 00:47:02.277]  Well, that's what the officers ought to be telling the people.
[00:47:02.337 --> 00:47:05.538]  And they're so angry because they know they're lying to the people.
[00:47:05.578 --> 00:47:11.819]  They know by the time that little grandmother calls on the magic phone that she's going to be dead by the time they get there.
[00:47:12.199 --> 00:47:14.941]  Now, I heard you reading over that poll.
[00:47:14.961 --> 00:47:16.042]  Do you have that in front of you?
[00:47:16.062 --> 00:47:18.404]  Because I want to go over that poll of police.
[00:47:18.964 --> 00:47:27.170]  Okay, well, this is somebody, one of our cops here has run off with the poll you're talking about, and I can't find it.
[00:47:28.391 --> 00:47:31.474]  But I have statistics, of course, that we've published here.
[00:47:32.094 --> 00:47:32.935]  We're good to go.
[00:47:48.563 --> 00:47:53.145]  Almost 17,000 command officers in the state, county, and city agencies.
[00:47:53.685 --> 00:47:59.667]  Now, remember, folks, the command officers are usually more political than the beat officer.
[00:48:00.087 --> 00:48:07.650]  So these figures would be much higher if you interviewed almost 17,000 beat officers and not their commanders.
[00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:13.512]  But anyway, with 17,000 police officers, command officers interviewed by the wonderful...
[00:48:15.076 --> 00:48:32.049]  American Federation of Police, they came out with 90% in this survey said that they did not agree that the banning of any firearms, assault, rifle, shotgun, handgun, that there would be a reduction in crime, nor will it stop criminals from obtaining weapons.
[00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:40.116]  88% did not agree that the banning of ownership of firearms by private citizens will result in fewer crimes committed by firearms.
[00:48:40.636 --> 00:48:41.697]  And here's the shocker.
[00:48:41.937 --> 00:48:44.419]  Here's the shocker that just makes me so proud
[00:48:45.333 --> 00:48:56.539]  A full, and this is a few years back, 86% of these command officers believed that it was not for hunting and target shooting that the Second Amendment was placed in the U.S.
[00:48:56.599 --> 00:49:06.344]  Constitution, but for every citizen to be able, number one, defend their person and property, and number two, to defend this nation from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:49:06.934 --> 00:49:08.595]  Now, that was a shocker even to me.
[00:49:08.995 --> 00:49:20.121]  Now, Jack, you brought up how to get the federal money, they're ordered to go stand behind Bill Clinton or Chuckie Schumer or George W., who's going to resign the assault weapons ban and create this DARPA system over gun owners.
[00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:20.681]  That's right.
[00:49:21.021 --> 00:49:21.742]  And that's the new bill.
[00:49:22.542 --> 00:49:27.607]  But it did come out that they were, quote, ordered to stand behind Ashcroft for his Patriot Act tour.
[00:49:27.667 --> 00:49:29.769]  That did come out in the Associated Press.
[00:49:29.989 --> 00:49:30.890]  No, it did not.
[00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:32.951]  And that's the absolute truth.
[00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:43.000]  Every time they wanted to do this tour for the wonderful Patriot Act that Ashcroft's been doing, they always forced my fellow officers to stand behind this creep
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:49.702]  And make it look like they're supporting this draconian law passed to remove people's rights.
[00:49:49.922 --> 00:50:00.426]  Yeah, when they say police are for gun control, that means dirty, corrupt officials in major cities, a handful of national police chiefs that will be in the Justice Department a year from now.
[00:50:00.766 --> 00:50:01.246]  That's right.
[00:50:01.286 --> 00:50:05.688]  The National Association of Chiefs of Police is a socialist Marxist organization.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.561]  We're good to go.
[00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:30.502]  He believed his job was to remove all the guns out of the hands of the American people in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:50:31.242 --> 00:50:45.525]  And so when you hear anything from the National Association of Chiefs of Police or NOBLE, which is the National Association of Black Police Officers and the others, they are Marxists and socialists, and they're going to be for gun control.
[00:50:45.946 --> 00:50:48.026]  All right, Jack McClellan, Police Against the New World Order.
[00:50:48.046 --> 00:50:49.786]  We'll give out his website and more on the other side.
[00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:52.787]  Keep him with us into the next hour and take your calls.
[00:50:53.724 --> 00:50:57.008]  On the open borders, on gun control, on the New World Order, on all of it.
[00:50:57.809 --> 00:50:59.972]  Jack's been out there for 23 years fighting this thing.
[00:51:00.372 --> 00:51:01.334]  I've been doing it for a decade.
[00:51:01.374 --> 00:51:02.135]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:03.456 --> 00:51:07.001]  And my websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:51:09.992 --> 00:51:11.953]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:51:12.053 --> 00:51:12.713]  Hello, folks.
[00:51:12.833 --> 00:51:22.755]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 fluoride and arsenic reduction elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:51:23.136 --> 00:51:27.657]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:39.060]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste, and odors are separated from the water.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.121]  We're good to go.
[00:52:10.121 --> 00:52:14.465]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:52:14.645 --> 00:52:19.069]  Police State 3 details the architecture goals and operations of the New World Order.
[00:52:19.229 --> 00:52:23.613]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:52:23.633 --> 00:52:24.975]  The New World Order.
[00:52:25.695 --> 00:52:26.756]  Can emerge.
[00:52:26.777 --> 00:52:30.981]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:52:31.061 --> 00:52:37.989]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:52:38.129 --> 00:52:40.132]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:52:40.512 --> 00:52:50.834]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:52:51.114 --> 00:52:56.475]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:52:56.995 --> 00:52:59.636]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:52:59.736 --> 00:53:00.916]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:53:01.156 --> 00:53:01.456]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:53:01.516 --> 00:53:03.197]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:53:10.421 --> 00:53:13.143]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name-brand medications.
[00:53:13.283 --> 00:53:16.965]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name-brand prescription medications.
[00:53:34.096 --> 00:53:34.496]  We're good to go.
[00:54:04.236 --> 00:54:05.837]  815-7094.
[00:54:05.937 --> 00:54:06.378]  Don't wait.
[00:54:06.518 --> 00:54:18.686]  Do it today.
[00:54:20.287 --> 00:54:25.130]  Jack McClam has been in the fight against the New World Order longer than most people I know.
[00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:28.192]  Except for maybe like Red Beckman or somebody who's been in it for 40 years.
[00:54:30.213 --> 00:54:30.914]  Or Bill Benson.
[00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:42.678]  Jack McClan, before we go to Ed in Pennsylvania and others that are holding into the next hour, get into Vicente Fox and the Borders and the rest of it, for those that just joined us, what is the New World Order?
[00:54:42.878 --> 00:54:43.738]  What's its goal?
[00:54:44.139 --> 00:54:45.200]  How far along is it?
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.300]  And what can we do to stop it?
[00:54:47.662 --> 00:54:51.004]  Well, you're asking a born-again Christian here about it.
[00:54:51.024 --> 00:54:53.807]  So my first comment would be it's in the Bible.
[00:54:54.427 --> 00:54:57.750]  You know, it's the Antichrist world system being set up by God.
[00:54:58.505 --> 00:54:59.606]  We're good to go.
[00:55:16.656 --> 00:55:18.997]  And that's why they love Mexico so much, because that's the model.
[00:55:19.017 --> 00:55:20.037]  They're going to bring all that here.
[00:55:20.257 --> 00:55:20.777]  That's right.
[00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:38.944]  Remember in 1955 or 4, I think it was 1954, the head of the Ford Foundation, Rowan Gaither, made the statement that it was his duty to use their tax-free foundation money to lower the standard of living in the United States so we could be merged with the Soviet Union.
[00:55:38.964 --> 00:55:41.745]  And the environmentalists say that, and now the head of the Navy...
[00:55:42.446 --> 00:55:43.466]  Who said that, brother?
[00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:43.586]  Okay.
[00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:43.867]  Oh, okay.
[00:56:05.931 --> 00:56:06.432]  What'd you say?
[00:56:06.892 --> 00:56:07.252]  Clark.
[00:56:07.393 --> 00:56:08.113]  Admiral Clark.
[00:56:08.374 --> 00:56:08.794]  Oh, yes.
[00:56:08.914 --> 00:56:09.275]  Okay.
[00:56:09.315 --> 00:56:11.056]  Well, I'll have to get a copy of that.
[00:56:11.076 --> 00:56:11.817]  I haven't seen it yet.
[00:56:11.877 --> 00:56:13.078]  But that's true.
[00:56:13.179 --> 00:56:26.833]  You know, if you really think about it, this raid on Walmart, who's the number one promoter of the red Chinese, who are totally against the United States, was raided and all the illegals were snatched up.
[00:56:28.195 --> 00:56:37.851]  You know, the plan is you have to reduce America to a third world nation because, just like the head of the Ford Foundation said, how do you merge us together...
[00:56:38.738 --> 00:56:44.760]  If we have all the inside toilets and the cars and the TVs and the rest of the world doesn't.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:50.222]  And they've got the environmental groups selling us a lower standard of living and all these new taxes on energy.
[00:56:50.462 --> 00:56:51.102]  That's right.
[00:56:51.182 --> 00:57:04.987]  So the American people better wake up because we're coming down to third world nation status and the guy at Walmart said that, well, these poor guys only make $30 a week in Mexico and other places and we've given them $380 a week.
[00:57:05.007 --> 00:57:05.087]  Well...
[00:57:07.848 --> 00:57:08.869]  Watch it, America.
[00:57:08.909 --> 00:57:17.612]  We're coming down to $30 a week because they have to bring us down to that point so we can be merged together in this utopian, antichrist world government.
[00:57:17.732 --> 00:57:22.393]  And the dollars plunging and the bankruptcies are at record levels and debts at record levels, public and private.
[00:57:22.753 --> 00:57:24.314]  And they're telling us, oh, GDP's up.
[00:57:24.354 --> 00:57:26.334]  Yeah, because of the war.
[00:57:26.535 --> 00:57:28.575]  But look, I saw the statistics a month ago.
[00:57:28.615 --> 00:57:29.336]  The government grew.
[00:57:29.636 --> 00:57:30.856]  The Fortune 500 got richer.
[00:57:30.936 --> 00:57:32.016]  Everybody else got poorer.
[00:57:32.296 --> 00:57:33.677]  It's not free market, is it?
[00:57:33.937 --> 00:57:34.557]  That's right.
[00:57:34.678 --> 00:57:42.022]  And my wife works in a state job that handles people out of work in the state of Idaho here.
[00:57:42.502 --> 00:57:47.285]  And I'll tell you what, it's never been as bad as it is now in Idaho and other states.
[00:57:49.235 --> 00:57:50.257]  We're good to go.
[00:57:50.357 --> 00:57:50.637]  I think?
[00:58:05.658 --> 00:58:13.510]  And we would no longer have manufacturing and industry, but instead of $25 an hour jobs, we'd have $5 and $6 an hour jobs.
[00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:17.256]  And in the 30s, the New York Times said we were going to have 10 regions.
[00:58:17.616 --> 00:58:19.459]  Plug the website, Jack, for you in this hour.
[00:58:20.532 --> 00:58:21.052]  What'd you say?
[00:58:21.212 --> 00:58:22.093]  Plug your website.
[00:58:22.313 --> 00:58:22.853]  Oh, okay.
[00:58:23.013 --> 00:58:23.393]  All right.
[00:58:23.593 --> 00:58:26.615]  Now, this is a long name, but it's very easy to find.
[00:58:26.675 --> 00:58:30.996]  Just keep in mind it's Police and Military Against the New World Order.
[00:58:31.136 --> 00:58:34.238]  Just type that into a search engine, and you're the second thing that pops up.
[00:58:34.298 --> 00:58:34.758]  That's right.
[00:58:34.798 --> 00:58:37.479]  Police and Military Against the New World Order.
[00:58:37.619 --> 00:58:41.401]  And if you put a dash between each word and .com, then you're there.
[00:58:41.661 --> 00:58:42.201]  Okay, Jack.
[00:58:42.641 --> 00:58:43.522]  McClain, we've got to break.
[00:58:43.562 --> 00:58:44.703]  Third hour coming up, folks.
[00:58:45.203 --> 00:58:47.605]  Visit InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:47.925 --> 00:58:52.008]  Get the new video, Matrix of Evil.
[00:58:52.509 --> 00:58:52.769]  Get it.
[00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:54.490]  We're going to break here in about five seconds.
[00:58:54.991 --> 00:58:57.593]  We'll be back with the third hour with Jack McClain and your calls.
[00:58:57.633 --> 00:58:58.093]  Stay with us.
[00:59:00.275 --> 00:59:07.780]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[00:59:08.061 --> 00:59:10.723]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because in...
[00:59:15.655 --> 00:59:17.436]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:59:25.421 --> 00:59:26.061]  Big Brother.
[00:59:26.721 --> 00:59:27.762]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:28.502 --> 00:59:29.603]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:30.243 --> 00:59:31.064]  You want answers?
[00:59:31.824 --> 00:59:32.725]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:32.745 --> 00:59:37.147]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:37.567 --> 00:59:41.650]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:43.626 --> 00:59:48.390]  We've been in the broadcast for the last 60 minutes.
[00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:49.931]  The next two hours is live.
[00:59:49.971 --> 00:59:51.152]  It is Thursday, November 6, 2003.
[00:59:52.092 --> 00:59:56.195]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:56.275 --> 00:59:59.718]  Again, it is Thursday, the 6th of November, 2003.
[00:59:59.958 --> 01:00:07.283]  You heard an interview with Glenn Spencer yesterday, and of course, part of the interview with Jack McClam.
[01:00:09.011 --> 01:00:16.953]  We're going to cover the global news, the national news, the local news, talk about media censorship here in the next two hours.
[01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:27.056]  And, of course, I'll tell you the story of the eventful evening protesting Governor Rick Perry and El Presidente Vicente Fox.
[01:00:27.076 --> 01:00:31.617]  I want to thank the folks that came out on such short notice last night.
[01:00:32.242 --> 01:00:33.683]  We're good to go.
[01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:04.152]  And nothing is in our local news or in the paper.
[01:01:04.232 --> 01:01:05.753]  Maybe you saw something on the news.
[01:01:05.813 --> 01:01:08.835]  Maybe you saw something in a paper and can call in and tell us.
[01:01:09.275 --> 01:01:11.297]  And it isn't, oh, did we get in the newspaper?
[01:01:12.478 --> 01:01:14.459]  No, the question is, why wouldn't we?
[01:01:14.599 --> 01:01:17.621]  In fact, in the States when they talk about how Fox was protested,
[01:01:18.769 --> 01:01:19.870]  I think we're good to go.
[01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:21.431]  I think we're good to go.
[01:01:48.679 --> 01:01:57.504]  Nothing in the paper, nothing we can find on TV, nothing in the Houston Chronicle, nothing in the Dallas Morning News, nothing in the San Antonio Express News.
[01:01:57.544 --> 01:02:10.090]  They all ran stories, and from what I've seen, scanning over them, didn't mention that there was a protest there of whites and blacks and Hispanics and Asians, Americans who were against open borders and illegal immigration.
[01:02:11.832 --> 01:02:26.401]  And I would say, number one, Fox today, and they've announced, is going to present awards to the APD, and this is in the paper today, but it was in the paper two days ago as well, for not enforcing federal law and not going after illegal aliens.
[01:02:27.361 --> 01:02:29.583]  All this with the Walmart arrest and the rest of it.
[01:02:30.884 --> 01:02:41.370]  And he's going to also give Wells Fargo an award for shipping all the money down south and working on the, quote, consular matricula card, or the total legalization of all illegals in this country.
[01:02:42.972 --> 01:02:43.352]  We're good to go.
[01:03:10.635 --> 01:03:15.698]  We bullhorned him and yelled at him when he came in, went around the back for his press conference.
[01:03:16.118 --> 01:03:18.280]  They shut that thing down about a minute into it.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:27.565]  The police tried to stop us from going around the back of the building on a public street, so we had to go around the block and cut around, still had them trying to stop us.
[01:03:28.386 --> 01:03:35.230]  When Fox pulled through, I was about 20 feet from him, bullhorning him, saying, go home, traitor, go home, bloodsucker.
[01:03:37.271 --> 01:03:37.411]  And...
[01:03:38.704 --> 01:03:39.624]  We're good to go.
[01:03:39.644 --> 01:03:40.224]  We're good to go.
[01:04:00.362 --> 01:04:02.224]  I mean, just, the guy is really wicked.
[01:04:02.624 --> 01:04:04.986]  And other people are saying, did you see how evil he looked?
[01:04:05.026 --> 01:04:06.727]  The leering smile he gave us.
[01:04:07.228 --> 01:04:11.351]  Janet Reno did the same thing when I confronted her at the LBJ Presidential Library.
[01:04:12.312 --> 01:04:15.275]  Why is there a news blackout on our protest?
[01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:17.396]  That's a concern, everybody.
[01:04:17.436 --> 01:04:18.037]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:20.327 --> 01:04:24.649]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:24.849 --> 01:04:29.252]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:29.412 --> 01:04:33.794]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:33.834 --> 01:04:35.155]  The New World Order.
[01:04:35.971 --> 01:04:37.172]  We're good to go.
[01:05:03.931 --> 01:05:04.191]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:04.211 --> 01:05:05.113]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:05:19.751 --> 01:05:21.273]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:05:21.453 --> 01:05:22.595]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:05:22.775 --> 01:05:26.179]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:05:26.299 --> 01:05:26.720]  Phenol?
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:34.169]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:05:34.449 --> 01:05:38.554]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:05:38.674 --> 01:05:39.115]  Fragrance?
[01:05:39.475 --> 01:05:44.218]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:05:44.379 --> 01:05:49.042]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:05:49.282 --> 01:05:51.824]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:05:52.104 --> 01:05:55.506]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:59.189]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:05:59.409 --> 01:06:01.771]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:06:01.931 --> 01:06:02.792]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:06:02.912 --> 01:06:12.679]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:06:20.012 --> 01:06:28.639]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:06:28.859 --> 01:06:40.128]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:06:40.348 --> 01:06:43.010]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:43.351 --> 01:06:47.454]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:06:49.277 --> 01:06:58.049]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.

[01:07:08.963 --> 01:07:10.004]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:07:10.184 --> 01:07:11.505]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:07:28.491 --> 01:07:29.572]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:30.232 --> 01:07:31.052]  You want answers?
[01:07:31.833 --> 01:07:33.733]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:33.753 --> 01:07:37.015]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:37.575 --> 01:07:41.677]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:47.439 --> 01:07:49.240]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.681]  until 2 p.m.
[01:07:50.761 --> 01:07:52.321]  Central Standard Time.
[01:07:53.162 --> 01:07:53.742]  We're live!
[01:07:54.392 --> 01:07:54.892]  We're good to go.
[01:07:54.972 --> 01:07:56.213]  We're good to go.
[01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:33.646]  And he's meeting with governors openly saying, legalize all the illegals except our little matricula cards that we'll issue to anybody who's got $25.
[01:08:33.726 --> 01:08:40.511]  We're going to open bigger consulates all over the country.
[01:08:40.531 --> 01:08:43.934]  They opened a big one in Chicago which issues these ID cards.
[01:08:43.954 --> 01:08:48.037]  They'll issue them to Russians, Chinese, Arabs, it doesn't matter.
[01:08:49.437 --> 01:08:50.037]  We're good to go.
[01:08:50.057 --> 01:08:50.818]  We're good to go.
[01:09:18.757 --> 01:09:32.208]  And he's going to give an award to Wells Fargo that, of course, sends tens of billions of dollars a year down to Mexico, boosting their economy, but also lobbies for the matricula with city officials.
[01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:37.452]  That's Mexico's lobbying arm or financial arm in this country to a great extent.
[01:09:38.513 --> 01:09:39.714]  And it's a federal crime.
[01:09:41.235 --> 01:09:46.580]  If I hire illegal aliens knowingly and falsify records, falsify names...
[01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:53.085]  That's a felony, but not when the city, not when the state, not when the police department does it.
[01:09:54.126 --> 01:10:01.788]  When you have government or private organizations en masse in an organized fashion breaking the law, it's called racketeering.
[01:10:02.609 --> 01:10:05.790]  It's called conspiracy when two or more people do that.
[01:10:06.923 --> 01:10:19.953]  But right here in the open, in everybody's face, giving out awards for the matricula card, giving out awards for the day labor site, giving out awards for institutionalizing and supporting the illegal alien invasion.
[01:10:20.013 --> 01:10:21.354]  It's like Senator Orrin Hatch.
[01:10:21.834 --> 01:10:24.356]  He wants to give extra tuition to illegal aliens.
[01:10:25.797 --> 01:10:27.558]  More tuition than citizens get.
[01:10:28.018 --> 01:10:28.899]  An incentive.
[01:10:28.939 --> 01:10:34.163]  The government wants more illegal aliens here, driving down the wages and being a new voting bloc.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.900]  So I get down there at about 6.20.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.842]  I start bullhorning all the way through to about 7.35, 7.40.
[01:10:44.163 --> 01:10:46.984]  And about 50, 60 motorcycles pull up.
[01:10:47.904 --> 01:10:52.785]  The police start trying to push us back, not just off the street, but over the sidewalk.
[01:10:54.046 --> 01:10:56.587]  They're bugging their eyes out at us, trying to bully us.
[01:10:56.787 --> 01:10:58.567]  I mean, that's why I get mad at the police.
[01:10:59.347 --> 01:11:02.849]  And in pulls Vicente Fox right by me, 15, 20 feet away.
[01:11:02.909 --> 01:11:03.929]  I'm bullhorning him.
[01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:12.179]  Saying he's a dictator, saying he's a thug, saying go back to Mexico, this is Texas, we don't want to be serfs or slaves or peons.
[01:11:12.199 --> 01:11:16.583]  That's what peon means, it's the Mexican term for serf.
[01:11:18.245 --> 01:11:29.254]  And he jumps over his wife, because he was on the other side of the car, he literally jumps over her, leers at us as he drives by, and I thought, is it just me, or did that guy look like a demon?
[01:11:29.895 --> 01:11:31.356]  You know, the archetypal devil.
[01:11:32.628 --> 01:11:38.650]  You know, the big guy with the mustache and the evil eyes, and people start walking over going, did you see how he looked at us?
[01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:40.091]  Did you see how evil he looked?
[01:11:40.791 --> 01:11:45.193]  It was like this weird green light in the car, you know, that his face was illuminated.
[01:11:45.213 --> 01:11:48.774]  So I was, I mean, I wasn't going to say, did you see how evil he looked?
[01:11:48.814 --> 01:11:50.775]  And suddenly people are going, did you see how evil he looked?
[01:11:51.055 --> 01:11:52.375]  Did you see that look he gave us?
[01:11:53.756 --> 01:11:54.496]  He just loved it.
[01:11:55.891 --> 01:11:58.313]  And then we run around the back of the governor's mansion.
[01:11:58.473 --> 01:12:01.355]  Well, the police wouldn't let us go down the side street, though it wasn't even blocked.
[01:12:01.415 --> 01:12:04.397]  They just said, well, we'll arrest you, so we had to go around the block behind them.
[01:12:05.278 --> 01:12:09.441]  They walked down from their car over the back steps of the governor's mansion.
[01:12:09.761 --> 01:12:11.122]  They were there giving a press conference.
[01:12:11.142 --> 01:12:18.287]  About a minute into it, we start bullhorning them real, real loud, telling them, this isn't Mexico.
[01:12:18.387 --> 01:12:22.510]  What you're doing here is racketeering, giving awards to people for violating federal law.
[01:12:23.735 --> 01:12:26.497]  We don't want to be under the tyranny of your corrupt system.
[01:12:26.538 --> 01:12:29.580]  We want to free the Mexican people and keep the American people free.
[01:12:31.101 --> 01:12:38.448]  There were a bunch of Hispanic folks there, black, white, old, young, screaming and yelling at them right up against the fence.
[01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:46.876]  Some of the governor's officials, I heard them, trying to get the state police to force us off the steps to the back gate.
[01:12:46.976 --> 01:12:54.863]  The state police, who've been sued successfully for arresting people for doing that, backed off and were saying, no, we're not going to do it.
[01:12:54.883 --> 01:12:58.286]  A lot of them were smiling at us and enjoyed what we were saying.
[01:12:58.306 --> 01:13:02.269]  It was the APD that was out of control, and not all of them, but some of them.
[01:13:04.111 --> 01:13:04.231]  And...
[01:13:05.174 --> 01:13:10.236]  Then Fox and the governor, Rick Perry, break off their press conference.
[01:13:10.336 --> 01:13:11.976]  I mean, a minute into it, folks.
[01:13:11.996 --> 01:13:13.437]  A minute and a half into it or so.
[01:13:15.378 --> 01:13:19.379]  And there's a photo in the San Antonio Express News.
[01:13:20.199 --> 01:13:22.160]  I'm only about 50 yards from them.
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:27.362]  Because they're about 50 yards, maybe 30, 40 yards past the gate that I'm at bullhorning them with this crowd.
[01:13:29.319 --> 01:13:32.141]  And the look on their faces is the look I saw.
[01:13:32.561 --> 01:13:33.842]  I mean, they were upset.
[01:13:33.922 --> 01:13:34.783]  They were shocked.
[01:13:34.903 --> 01:13:49.353]  They had the wind taken out of their sails as they waved to the crowd walking up the steps into the governor's mansion with, I believe it was the Marine Corps ROTC there in dress white uniforms saluting them with their swords as they walked in.
[01:13:51.314 --> 01:13:52.095]  And so I'm...
[01:13:53.247 --> 01:14:08.477]  Looking at this in the paper, and I'm reading all these news articles out of the Dallas Morning News, San Antonio Express News, Houston Chronicle, Austin American Statesman, and they say nothing about the protest, nothing about people being against open borders.
[01:14:10.719 --> 01:14:21.406]  There's a little blurb here saying, well, he got a warm welcome in Austin, but his welcome wasn't as warm in Arizona.
[01:14:21.446 --> 01:14:22.747]  Listen to this from the statesman.
[01:14:25.245 --> 01:14:43.753]  Though he was largely greeted warmly at his stops in New Mexico, Fox was forced to address demonstrators at a public event in Santa Fe Plaza protesting the murders and disappearances of hundreds of young women in Mexican border city of Juarez.
[01:14:44.568 --> 01:14:51.430]  Over the past 10 years, I would like to address with respect the group of women who came here with a great cause, Fox said.
[01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:54.351]  We do not want any other murders in Juarez.
[01:14:54.851 --> 01:14:57.592]  By the way, they say 400 women are missing.
[01:14:57.612 --> 01:14:58.993]  They found over 100 bodies.
[01:14:59.633 --> 01:15:03.334]  But a lot of these women are being shipped overseas as sex slaves.
[01:15:03.354 --> 01:15:04.635]  They're being used in snuff films.
[01:15:04.895 --> 01:15:06.775]  This has been in the major papers, by the way, hasn't it?
[01:15:07.276 --> 01:15:11.417]  And yes, many of them have had their hearts cut out, their intestines ripped out when they find them.
[01:15:11.677 --> 01:15:14.078]  They're being murdered by a satanic cult.
[01:15:15.453 --> 01:15:23.339]  If you're doubting me, just type in Matamoros, hundreds of bodies found killed by satanic cult, or satanic cult in Matamoros, satanic cult in Juarez.
[01:15:23.979 --> 01:15:25.660]  Of course, that's not in the paper today.
[01:15:26.461 --> 01:15:28.943]  But, of course, Satanists don't exist either.
[01:15:29.943 --> 01:15:36.148]  But hundreds of dead bodies from Texas to New Mexico, and they've been sacrificed.
[01:15:36.208 --> 01:15:39.130]  And that's been in Texas Monthly, that's been in our local papers.
[01:15:39.971 --> 01:15:43.353]  If you didn't know about it, you might want to research it.
[01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:47.050]  Notice, though, you don't hear a lot about it in the national media.
[01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:55.438]  There should be movies and miniseries and dramas made about this and investigative reports on Discovery Channel.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:02.926]  I mean, if one psychopath kidnaps somebody and kills them, it's a big news story, but not when it's hundreds and hundreds.
[01:16:03.707 --> 01:16:05.249]  The point here is that...
[01:16:07.426 --> 01:16:08.006]  We're good to go.
[01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:40.837]  He stood up to these thugs, and there were Hispanic folks on the bullhorn talking about the New World Order and how this is to break down America and how Fox oppresses the Mexican people, which he does.
[01:16:41.458 --> 01:16:43.039]  You'd think that'd be newsworthy.
[01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:44.740]  Nothing on the news.
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:45.780]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:47.301]  There's nothing in print media.
[01:16:47.361 --> 01:16:53.145]  I couldn't find anything at ABC, CBS, NBC, or News 8, which is a local Time Warner cable channel.
[01:16:53.165 --> 01:16:53.926]  We have a local CNN.
[01:16:55.345 --> 01:16:56.466]  Did you see something?
[01:16:56.566 --> 01:16:57.307]  I hope you did.
[01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:24.527]  We found out that there was nothing on TV last night.
[01:17:24.607 --> 01:17:25.527]  Maybe we missed it.
[01:17:26.328 --> 01:17:46.302]  Because if there is a total news blackout on the issues we were raising, a fox there to give awards to city officials for racketeering, and that's what it is, folks, for en masse violating federal law, protecting legal aliens, setting up day labor sites for them, that is very, very serious.
[01:17:47.343 --> 01:17:49.524]  I'd like to hear from police officers on this issue.
[01:17:49.624 --> 01:17:50.725]  Is it not racketeering?
[01:17:51.434 --> 01:17:53.274]  Is it not the law, stupid?
[01:17:54.975 --> 01:18:00.496]  Again, for those that are experts on the law or on what racketeering is, I'm sure you concur, but if you disagree, give me a call too.
[01:18:02.137 --> 01:18:13.299]  But these major issues we were raising, I had a dozen news cameras around me, multiple radio stations, multiple papers, interviewing me, interviewing others.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:16.080]  Nothing in the news about it.
[01:18:17.992 --> 01:18:23.017]  You see, if a tree falls in the forest and nobody was there to hear it make a sound, you know, did it make a sound?
[01:18:24.899 --> 01:18:25.920]  And this is how they do it.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.621]  This is how they lie in the media.
[01:18:27.982 --> 01:18:28.903]  By omission.
[01:18:28.983 --> 01:18:31.505]  By not letting you know what went on.
[01:18:31.605 --> 01:18:33.227]  Not letting you know what happened.
[01:18:34.787 --> 01:18:34.847]  1-800-259-9231
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:09.563]  And the websites are Infowars.com.
[01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:11.425]  The U.S.
[01:19:11.525 --> 01:19:13.566]  government ordered via the U.N.
[01:19:13.606 --> 01:19:16.829]  the takedown for no reason of Prison Planet, though it's now going to be back up.
[01:19:17.429 --> 01:19:19.291]  You can link through at Infowars to Prison Planet.
[01:19:20.985 --> 01:19:24.266]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:28.487]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:19:28.747 --> 01:19:31.527]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:19:31.727 --> 01:19:34.128]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:19:34.308 --> 01:19:42.970]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:44.510]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:48.951]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:19:49.191 --> 01:19:53.975]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:20:10.066 --> 01:20:16.637]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:17.999 --> 01:20:19.361]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:20.984 --> 01:20:24.610]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:30.465]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:20:30.925 --> 01:20:32.006]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:20:32.046 --> 01:20:36.110]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:50.002]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:20:50.543 --> 01:20:51.143]  We're good to go.
[01:20:51.183 --> 01:20:51.503]  We're good to go.

[01:22:38.965 --> 01:22:40.466]  Not convinced yet?
[01:22:40.506 --> 01:22:45.590]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?

[01:23:01.481 --> 01:23:02.342]  We're good to go.
[01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.755]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:28.215 --> 01:23:31.037]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:33.938 --> 01:23:51.828]  You know, I think, in fact I know, that listeners of this show, especially if you live in Austin, Texas, really should contact the writers of this Austin American Statesman report, front page of the paper,
[01:23:53.766 --> 01:24:02.391]  Where they say that everyone loves Vicente Fox in Austin, but he didn't get as warm a welcome in New Mexico or Arizona.
[01:24:03.432 --> 01:24:04.572]  I mean, that's a lie.
[01:24:04.652 --> 01:24:06.253]  And I saw these statesmen reporters.
[01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:10.716]  These are the same guys that were sitting in the lap of the Deputy U.S.
[01:24:10.776 --> 01:24:12.117]  Attorney, the Assistant U.S.
[01:24:12.177 --> 01:24:14.879]  Attorney, when we got rid of the Patriot Act in Austin.
[01:24:16.359 --> 01:24:18.981]  And the mutilation, the article they wrote,
[01:24:19.867 --> 01:24:26.671]  About what really happened at the council was full of inaccuracies and flat-out distortions.
[01:24:27.352 --> 01:24:31.374]  And so we'll get into who those writers are and how you can email them.
[01:24:31.394 --> 01:24:37.618]  But everybody should dump their subscription to the Austin American-Statesman.
[01:24:37.638 --> 01:24:39.879]  I mean, it is a horrible paper.
[01:24:40.499 --> 01:24:46.463]  But what scares me is that all the other Texas papers ignored the protest.
[01:24:47.483 --> 01:24:48.284]  Think about that.
[01:24:49.369 --> 01:24:50.190]  Think about that.
[01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:59.817]  Think about that long and hard, folks, the control, and what you're not hearing and what you're not learning and what you're not getting informed on.
[01:25:01.879 --> 01:25:07.503]  Okay, let's go to, is it Sherry in Texas or Shirley?
[01:25:10.365 --> 01:25:11.646]  Go ahead, caller from Texas.
[01:25:11.686 --> 01:25:12.126]  Go ahead.
[01:25:12.587 --> 01:25:13.047]  Hey, Alex?
[01:25:13.287 --> 01:25:13.948]  Yes, who is this?
[01:25:13.968 --> 01:25:14.848]  This is Sherry.
[01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.289]  Oh.
[01:25:15.869 --> 01:25:16.129]  Hey.
[01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:16.690]  Yes.
[01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:17.851]  I was there last night.
[01:25:18.798 --> 01:25:24.742]  And I had to get my daughter to bed for school, so a little after 8, we went ahead and left the crowd.
[01:25:24.842 --> 01:25:35.370]  After the news broke up and left, y'all, we went ahead and walked up, and right before we saw the great gift, Governor Perry gave the beautiful horse saddle to Fox.
[01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:38.292]  They were loading in the car, which I thought was funny.
[01:25:39.052 --> 01:25:43.776]  Anyway, we rushed home, and I turned on Channel 8 the second we walked in the door.
[01:25:44.671 --> 01:25:48.117]  And they had the thing looping on Channel 8.
[01:25:48.157 --> 01:25:51.262]  I only could stay up to see it twice, but it was great.
[01:25:52.594 --> 01:26:00.837]  It shows Perry and Fox trying to speak, and you can hear you so clearly.
[01:26:01.177 --> 01:26:02.198]  It shook up Fox.
[01:26:02.278 --> 01:26:12.521]  Perry kept pretty straight, you know, but Fox was pausing, you know, in between each word, and each time you could hear you, and it was really throwing him off.
[01:26:12.681 --> 01:26:14.682]  I'm going to have to say this right now.
[01:26:15.042 --> 01:26:20.724]  I'm not a fan of Time Warner or CNN, but their local channel is the only...
[01:26:21.514 --> 01:26:26.838]  A news outlet that really carries what's happening, and it's good to hear that.
[01:26:27.158 --> 01:26:28.839]  We went to the other news sites and didn't see it.
[01:26:28.879 --> 01:26:33.001]  I hope somebody gets us a tape of that, so that makes me feel better about America.
[01:26:33.222 --> 01:26:38.685]  Because I read five newspapers this morning about it from the state, and there wasn't word one about it.
[01:26:39.105 --> 01:26:42.928]  Then there's this deceptive comment about, though he was largely greeted warmly,
[01:26:43.732 --> 01:26:49.815]  At his stops in New Mexico, Fox was forced to address demonstrators at a public event in Santa Fe Plaza.
[01:26:50.296 --> 01:26:59.481]  I know, it ticks me off, but the greatest part is I think they got into the studio so quick, because they go right in there and clip what they're going to put on, right?
[01:27:00.061 --> 01:27:00.801]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:27:18.661 --> 01:27:21.862]  Either was awake or made a boo-boo.
[01:27:22.102 --> 01:27:23.143]  Because I didn't see it after the second time.
[01:27:23.163 --> 01:27:27.144]  Well, what happens is they edited it in the truck, and I don't want to get people in trouble.
[01:27:27.265 --> 01:27:29.285]  Yes, we have friends inside News 8.
[01:27:29.485 --> 01:27:30.786]  Good.
[01:27:31.186 --> 01:27:33.567]  Because what happens is it's a 24-hour news channel.
[01:27:33.727 --> 01:27:35.628]  CNN's got like five of these things in the country.
[01:27:36.303 --> 01:27:38.824]  It's a local CNN news channel, for those who don't understand what we're saying.
[01:27:39.444 --> 01:27:45.106]  And, yeah, routinely they put me on there, because a bunch of them are fans down there.
[01:27:45.306 --> 01:27:46.507]  I didn't have a chance to see that.
[01:27:47.027 --> 01:27:47.527]  It was great.
[01:27:47.647 --> 01:27:50.328]  I was shocked by the newspaper not mentioning anything.
[01:27:50.588 --> 01:27:51.489]  Oh, it's insulting.
[01:27:51.949 --> 01:27:55.070]  Also, they got a great interview, and I was sad.
[01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:59.712]  We were mad we didn't have a taping, because we walked straight in the house and turned the TV on.
[01:28:00.242 --> 01:28:04.944]  Because it had, I can't quote what you said, but it was beefy, and they got it in there.
[01:28:05.324 --> 01:28:06.925]  And I know people watch that channel.
[01:28:07.565 --> 01:28:16.829]  And, I mean, it was just, you know, you're to be applauded, and, you know, you're speaking for so many of us that cannot speak as eloquently.
[01:28:17.229 --> 01:28:18.730]  Oh, yeah, I don't speak that eloquently, sure.
[01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:19.690]  Well, you're pretty darn good.
[01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:21.111]  You stay on track, man.
[01:28:21.151 --> 01:28:23.552]  Well, now, recap it exactly.
[01:28:23.572 --> 01:28:24.532]  What did the news piece have?
[01:28:24.552 --> 01:28:26.813]  Because I know they had to cancel the press conference.
[01:28:27.728 --> 01:28:37.492]  They had a close-up shot of Perry and Fox trying to speak straight, trying to keep a straight face when we're all out there hollering.
[01:28:37.952 --> 01:28:49.197]  And you can hear you over everyone, and when Perry's talking and he's totally straight, and then when Fox starts to talk, he is totally distracted.
[01:28:49.737 --> 01:28:55.360]  He's like, he's trying to not show any emotion, and he does a halfway good job.
[01:28:55.581 --> 01:28:57.442]  Well, I hope somebody will bring that tape down.
[01:28:57.462 --> 01:28:59.763]  I'll tape it and bring it down to the cable channel tonight.
[01:29:00.003 --> 01:29:06.367]  May I have permission to run off some copies or cards with this radio station?
[01:29:06.387 --> 01:29:08.628]  Because I'm doing it with pen and ink and paper.
[01:29:08.688 --> 01:29:09.309]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:09.329 --> 01:29:09.629]  Stay there.
[01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:12.210]  We're on the march.
[01:29:12.711 --> 01:29:14.312]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:15.232 --> 01:29:17.934]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:21.147 --> 01:29:22.768]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:29:23.129 --> 01:29:28.873]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:29:29.113 --> 01:29:34.257]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:29:34.598 --> 01:29:43.865]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:29:44.225 --> 01:29:49.187]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:29:49.487 --> 01:29:53.528]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:29:53.708 --> 01:29:58.510]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:29:58.850 --> 01:30:04.712]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:30:05.092 --> 01:30:14.138]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:14.318 --> 01:30:15.258]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:15.278 --> 01:30:16.399]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:20.885 --> 01:30:23.347]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[01:30:23.448 --> 01:30:23.948]  Pollution.
[01:30:23.968 --> 01:30:24.248]  Pollen.
[01:30:24.288 --> 01:30:25.389]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.870]  Allergies.
[01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:26.290]  Asthma.
[01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.911]  Probably not.
[01:30:27.111 --> 01:30:27.792]  Well, listen to this.
[01:30:28.012 --> 01:30:37.001]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[01:30:37.061 --> 01:30:37.902]  Six to ten times?
[01:30:37.942 --> 01:30:38.983]  How could that be, you ask?
[01:30:39.063 --> 01:30:39.323]  Worse.
[01:30:39.423 --> 01:30:40.764]  Think about what's inside your home.
[01:30:40.925 --> 01:30:41.605]  Hairspray.
[01:30:41.705 --> 01:30:42.206]  Chemicals.
[01:30:42.486 --> 01:30:43.167]  Does anyone smoke?
[01:30:43.187 --> 01:30:43.447]  Fumes.
[01:30:43.627 --> 01:30:45.229]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[01:30:45.729 --> 01:30:47.310]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:48.071]  Toxic fumes.
[01:30:48.111 --> 01:30:49.712]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[01:30:49.952 --> 01:30:52.534]  They go into you, into your children.
[01:30:52.574 --> 01:30:53.134]  Their lungs.
[01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:53.995]  Am I scaring you?
[01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:55.215]  Remember this word.
[01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:56.356]  Puritech.
[01:30:56.396 --> 01:30:57.917]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[01:30:57.977 --> 01:31:00.159]  Puritech makes the pure ear system.
[01:31:00.319 --> 01:31:12.867]  What this ear cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, BOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other ear purifiers, which do a lot less.
[01:31:12.987 --> 01:31:14.208]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:15.729]  That's 1-800-615-7094.
[01:31:15.769 --> 01:31:18.371]  That's a toll-free call that will lead you to the online pharmacy.
[01:31:18.411 --> 01:31:22.713]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name-brand medications.
[01:31:22.733 --> 01:31:23.613]  That's right, I said free.
[01:31:43.083 --> 01:31:57.968]  It's quick, it's easy, and it saves you money on popular name brand medications like diet pills and muscle relaxers, or painkillers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:31:58.008 --> 01:32:03.970]  You'll save money on anti-anxiety medications, heartburn relief, or allergy control, all without having to go to the doctor's office.
[01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:07.171]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:32:07.291 --> 01:32:08.431]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:41.104]  I got up this morning, and I went to ABC, CBS, NBC.
[01:32:43.025 --> 01:32:44.146]  I went to the News 8 channel.
[01:32:44.166 --> 01:32:48.630]  They didn't say anything about it, but I commend them for running the piece about our protest, our demonstration.
[01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:50.051]  Very newsworthy.
[01:32:50.671 --> 01:32:52.473]  I read five newspapers or more.
[01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:59.799]  That has scanned the Statesman in Austin, the San Antonio Express News, Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle.
[01:33:00.399 --> 01:33:02.320]  And it just said Fox gets a warm welcome.
[01:33:02.421 --> 01:33:03.401]  I got the articles right here.
[01:33:03.662 --> 01:33:05.223]  Oh, everybody loves him in Texas.
[01:33:07.817 --> 01:33:08.218]  We're good to go.
[01:33:08.278 --> 01:33:08.458]  I think?
[01:33:27.779 --> 01:33:38.022]  Of the Latino channels there, they were asking better questions and smiling at me and agreeing with me about Fox being a tyrant.
[01:33:38.182 --> 01:33:42.243]  I mean, I had so many Hispanics slapping me on the back.
[01:33:42.263 --> 01:33:44.724]  I thought I was going to get a big bruise or something.
[01:33:44.764 --> 01:33:51.686]  But people know that the PRI, the PRI, and Fox, you know, Fox is not an outsider.
[01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:55.067]  He's there to be a salve to con everybody back into the system.
[01:33:56.658 --> 01:33:58.139]  No, you're not going through here.
[01:34:20.525 --> 01:34:22.967]  I wasn't going to have a confrontation and play into their plan.
[01:34:23.587 --> 01:34:25.148]  So I just said, everybody, follow me.
[01:34:25.168 --> 01:34:27.229]  We're going down to 9th.
[01:34:27.469 --> 01:34:30.651]  And we cut down from 9th, went down around the back of the governor's mansion.
[01:34:31.112 --> 01:34:38.516]  And it took Perry and Fox a few minutes to walk down the grassy hill there, down to the back steps to have their press conference.
[01:34:39.297 --> 01:34:43.119]  And I'm told about a minute and a half into it, I came running up screaming at them.
[01:34:44.748 --> 01:34:47.670]  And, I mean, that bullhorn, folks, I've owned several bullhorns.
[01:34:47.710 --> 01:34:51.472]  I have a police bullhorn that supposedly is the most high power you can get.
[01:34:51.532 --> 01:34:54.654]  It's nothing compared to a radio-shot bullhorn.
[01:34:54.674 --> 01:35:00.157]  I think it's called Powerhorn that I bought about six years ago.
[01:35:00.217 --> 01:35:02.178]  That thing is absolutely amazing.
[01:35:02.218 --> 01:35:03.759]  I can take over any press conference.
[01:35:04.119 --> 01:35:05.180]  I can blanket everything.
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:06.580]  I can talk for two hours.
[01:35:07.041 --> 01:35:09.142]  And all of you can do the same thing.
[01:35:11.063 --> 01:35:12.824]  Guerrilla Information Warfare.
[01:35:14.509 --> 01:35:15.690]  Take in Road to Tyranny.
[01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:29.599]  We never got the actual news footage of where she was on the news, though everybody saw it, where I jump behind her when they're having a fake bio attack, and I go, it's fake, stage-managed event, psychological warfare, this is all fake to scare you.
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:31.421]  That all went over the news.
[01:35:31.461 --> 01:35:33.502]  The news then had to admit later that it was fake.
[01:35:33.822 --> 01:35:36.644]  But we do have the footage shot by our camera where I run up and do it.
[01:35:38.225 --> 01:35:40.787]  So, I mean, this is what you got to do, folks.
[01:35:41.443 --> 01:35:56.546]  This is what America's all about, and I was talking to Mexicans, who are now Americans, who came here legally and became citizens, and they have every right to, who were there, who were listeners to this show, and God bless you, you know who you are.
[01:35:56.927 --> 01:36:07.329]  And they said that in Mexico, you would be grabbed, tortured, you'd have Tabasco put up your nose, electrodes hooked up to your nose,
[01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:19.455]  Privates, within an hour, you'd have your teeth knocked out if you even spoke up against Vicente Fox, or the conquering fox is what his name means in Latin.
[01:36:21.816 --> 01:36:23.097]  So that is very encouraging.
[01:36:23.117 --> 01:36:26.518]  I want to go to all these callers.
[01:36:26.538 --> 01:36:27.539]  There's a whole slew of them.
[01:36:28.599 --> 01:36:31.601]  But, Sherry, finish up with what you were saying.
[01:36:31.641 --> 01:36:34.582]  You were saying, can you promote the radio stations we're on?
[01:36:35.003 --> 01:36:37.624]  Yeah, for months I've been going to, you know,
[01:36:38.177 --> 01:36:44.919]  To people after talking to them and writing it down and going into stores when they have on a different radio channel and writing it down.
[01:36:44.979 --> 01:36:52.841]  But, Sherry, you don't have to ask my permission or the government's permission to print up whatever you want, to produce whatever you want, to put up whatever websites you want.
[01:36:53.001 --> 01:36:53.641]  Absolutely.
[01:36:53.881 --> 01:36:54.681]  It's a free country.
[01:36:54.761 --> 01:36:56.262]  Please spread the word.
[01:36:56.582 --> 01:37:04.024]  Okay, because I can't afford to get all the movies, and the one thing I know I can do is if I can get people listening...
[01:37:04.631 --> 01:37:05.331]  Just once.
[01:37:05.391 --> 01:37:06.291]  They'll listen again.
[01:37:06.791 --> 01:37:07.312]  Absolutely.
[01:37:07.632 --> 01:37:13.533]  But recapping for folks, for myself, what exactly, how long was the newscast on News 8?
[01:37:13.833 --> 01:37:14.473]  What did they say?
[01:37:15.273 --> 01:37:19.674]  It was just a couple of minutes, but it was high impact.
[01:37:20.014 --> 01:37:24.935]  The best part, after Perry speaks, Fox is attempting to speak.
[01:37:25.395 --> 01:37:33.357]  And if anybody did get a copy of this, you'll see, in between each word, he's so distracted, he speaks.
[01:37:34.099 --> 01:37:35.020]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:37:51.529 --> 01:37:53.970]  You could see it pierce right through him.
[01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:55.551]  I know, I was looking in his eyes.
[01:37:55.891 --> 01:38:08.836]  He was looking right at me, and again, he leered at us with hatred whenever he drove by, so I ran around there to hit him hard, and he was faltering like he had the wind out of his sails, and they ran.
[01:38:09.236 --> 01:38:20.141]  They scurried from the news cameras and stumbled up the steps, and there's this San Antonio Express News photo of exactly what I saw, where both of them looked like they got slapped upside the head.
[01:38:20.581 --> 01:38:21.362]  Oh, it was amazing.
[01:38:21.722 --> 01:38:22.303]  It was amazing.
[01:38:22.643 --> 01:38:25.005]  And, you know... Because I was roaring, folks.
[01:38:25.305 --> 01:38:27.167]  I mean, I was, We're not your slaves!
[01:38:27.187 --> 01:38:28.008]  This is Texas!
[01:38:28.168 --> 01:38:29.649]  We're never backing down!
[01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:34.714]  And the Hispanic guy that was great, when you gave him the megaphone, and he says...
[01:38:35.723 --> 01:38:37.344]  You're a white guy.
[01:38:37.544 --> 01:38:48.967]  He yells at me in Spanish that he's not even Hispanic, and it was so great because I just told Jim, I wish I could yell through there something in Spanish, you know, Viva La Raza, Texas, or Viva La Raza, Mexico.
[01:38:49.387 --> 01:38:56.869]  I want to say this, you know, and then this guy gets your megaphone and he says it all in this language, you know, and it was beautiful.
[01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:58.150]  It was awesome.
[01:38:58.190 --> 01:38:59.190]  Sherry, good to hear from you.
[01:38:59.710 --> 01:39:00.430]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:01.251 --> 01:39:02.191]  Who's up next, Mark?
[01:39:02.231 --> 01:39:03.671]  I got my call list all confused.
[01:39:04.652 --> 01:39:05.252]  Who in Texas?
[01:39:06.266 --> 01:39:08.207]  Kathy in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:39:08.247 --> 01:39:08.608]  Welcome.
[01:39:09.088 --> 01:39:09.628]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:09.969 --> 01:39:10.649]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:39:10.909 --> 01:39:11.270]  Fine.
[01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:17.434]  I just wanted to say that I did see you on Channel 24 News this morning, and also there's an online statement.
[01:39:17.454 --> 01:39:21.557]  There is a little blurb or a little comment by you.
[01:39:22.557 --> 01:39:23.458]  Did you not see that?
[01:39:23.678 --> 01:39:26.420]  Well, it's not in the paper, so that's what I was saying.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:31.164]  It's an online statement, and I'll tell you real quick who the article's by.
[01:39:31.184 --> 01:39:31.884]  It's by...
[01:39:33.846 --> 01:39:38.989]  It says, Mexican ID cards are expected to be high on the agenda by Susan Ferris and Dave Harmon.
[01:39:39.710 --> 01:39:48.675]  And kind of scrolling on down the middle of the article, I'll do the comment before they mention you.
[01:39:48.695 --> 01:39:57.881]  It says, Perry and Fox emerged from the governor's mansion before dinner Wednesday night and said they plan to discuss issues ranging from education to trade to the conflict over water sharing.
[01:39:58.561 --> 01:40:01.143]  Tonight is about renewing old friendships, Perry said.
[01:40:01.784 --> 01:40:04.166]  I'm sure that it's going to be a great tomorrow, Fox said.
[01:40:04.206 --> 01:40:07.189]  We have a lot of common things to do to build toward the future.
[01:40:07.209 --> 01:40:11.912]  Fox's voice was nearly drowned out by several dozen protesters on the sidewalk.
[01:40:12.413 --> 01:40:19.178]  Local cable access television host Alex Jones, armed with a bullhorn, screamed, illegal immigration is destroying our sovereignty.
[01:40:19.879 --> 01:40:20.980]  Fox ignored him.
[01:40:21.621 --> 01:40:23.282]  And then that's all they say about you.
[01:40:24.213 --> 01:40:27.935]  Yeah, that's not in the big front page story.
[01:40:27.975 --> 01:40:30.777]  As I said, I read five major papers.
[01:40:31.017 --> 01:40:34.379]  There may be online blurbs or side caveats.
[01:40:34.399 --> 01:40:35.120]  They'll do that.
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:44.906]  But how can they say, though he was largely greeted warmly, and then they say he was greeted warmly in Texas, but he was not greeted warmly.
[01:40:44.926 --> 01:40:46.547]  There was no one there to greet him warmly.
[01:40:46.847 --> 01:40:47.107]  Right.
[01:40:47.167 --> 01:40:51.209]  Well, Channel 24 News had something similar to what Sherry described.
[01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:53.751]  I couldn't hear what you were saying because the anchor said,
[01:40:54.190 --> 01:41:01.552]  I was talking kind of at the same time, but you were down on your knees with the bullhorn shouting, but I couldn't make out what you were saying.
[01:41:02.472 --> 01:41:08.754]  But I just want to thank you for all you do, Alex, and the guts that you have, and we all need to be as courageous.
[01:41:08.774 --> 01:41:12.475]  I'd like to ask all the Christians out there to continue to cover you in prayer.
[01:41:12.495 --> 01:41:22.457]  Well, it is scary going up against a thug like Fox, the head of a narco-terrorist state like Mexico, a kleptocracy of thieving.
[01:41:23.317 --> 01:41:24.438]  But we've got to do it.
[01:41:24.458 --> 01:41:28.400]  We've got to stand up just like they did at the Alamo against this tyranny, and we will do it.
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:28.940]  Yes.
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:29.561]  Well, thank you.
[01:41:29.581 --> 01:41:37.886]  So basically, did 24 say anything about the protest, or did they just, I just took over the operation so they were going to have any footage they'd have to show me?
[01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:45.950]  They were showing the governor and Fox, and then they kind of cut to you real quick, and that was that.
[01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:46.731]  It was very short.
[01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:48.172]  And what was I saying?
[01:41:48.212 --> 01:41:48.492]  Nothing?
[01:41:48.512 --> 01:41:48.692]  Nothing.
[01:41:48.962 --> 01:41:53.204]  Well, you were shouting something, but the way they had, I couldn't make out what you were saying.
[01:41:53.244 --> 01:41:56.026]  I'm sure they intended it that way, because the anchor was speaking.
[01:41:56.306 --> 01:41:58.747]  Now, there's nothing on their websites, and, well, good.
[01:41:59.147 --> 01:42:03.230]  Well, it sounds like they tried to bury all this, but at least it got out there, and we want to commend News 8.
[01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.910]  Well, good.
[01:42:04.648 --> 01:42:08.510]  I feel better about it then, because if there was a blackout on this news, that would be amazing.
[01:42:08.690 --> 01:42:12.933]  Well, they do need to get you on and interview you to find out why you are upset about this.
[01:42:13.033 --> 01:42:15.494]  And it's just outrageous that they don't do it.
[01:42:15.554 --> 01:42:19.116]  Well, they did dozens of great interviews with folks that were more eloquent than I am.
[01:42:19.156 --> 01:42:21.918]  The point is, everybody was there against them.
[01:42:21.958 --> 01:42:23.018]  I'd say about 50 people.
[01:42:23.038 --> 01:42:25.259]  Well, there were about 30 up front, about 30 in the back.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:26.080]  I don't know total, but...
[01:42:26.907 --> 01:42:30.253]  People were not happy with this, and it was a very diverse crowd.
[01:42:30.914 --> 01:42:33.999]  And the main focus is, Fox is here.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:40.409]  Look, it says, Wednesday evening at the governor's mansion, Governor Rick Perry presented President Vicente Fox with a western saddle.
[01:42:41.286 --> 01:42:42.467]  We're good to go.
[01:43:11.883 --> 01:43:12.363]  Very true.
[01:43:12.544 --> 01:43:13.304]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:14.045 --> 01:43:14.786]  I appreciate it.
[01:43:15.086 --> 01:43:16.607]  Let's talk to Phil in Ohio.
[01:43:16.667 --> 01:43:17.328]  Phil, you're on the air.
[01:43:17.348 --> 01:43:17.748]  Go ahead.
[01:43:18.989 --> 01:43:19.570]  Okay.
[01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:20.290]  Bill in Ohio.
[01:43:20.330 --> 01:43:20.731]  Go ahead.
[01:43:21.371 --> 01:43:22.632]  There's a couple of things.
[01:43:22.732 --> 01:43:29.598]  One thing that I wanted to ask you about and one thing that occurred to me actually after I dialed up that I thought you might be interested in knowing.
[01:43:29.618 --> 01:43:40.267]  About three or four months ago, about 15, 20 miles north of where I live in the town at that location, there's a factory that
[01:43:40.883 --> 01:43:41.483]  I think we're good.
[01:44:07.603 --> 01:44:20.712]  I heard on National Proletarian Radio just about three or four days ago that Thompson Electronics had inked a deal with a company to open a new plant and begin producing televisions.
[01:44:22.213 --> 01:44:24.294]  And guess where the plant was located?
[01:44:25.735 --> 01:44:25.995]  Where?
[01:44:26.296 --> 01:44:28.277]  Can you spell chop suey?
[01:44:30.398 --> 01:44:31.239]  So, Japan.
[01:44:31.419 --> 01:44:32.300]  No, no, no, China.
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:34.561]  Oh, yeah, China.
[01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:36.923]  They're going to start making TVs over there, but...
[01:44:37.679 --> 01:44:42.240]  They had a plant already in place making the picture tubes here, and they can't use it.
[01:44:43.341 --> 01:44:50.243]  Now, the only thing I can think of is to suggest to people, the only thing that's going to get their attention is to hit them over the head.
[01:44:51.223 --> 01:44:53.063]  Just stop buying the stuff.
[01:44:53.383 --> 01:44:57.765]  Let it sit on the shelves until it's caked with dust a half an inch thick.
[01:44:58.165 --> 01:45:00.105]  Maybe that will finally get their attention.
[01:45:00.205 --> 01:45:01.166]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:45:01.226 --> 01:45:03.906]  You can't find any electronics made in America.
[01:45:04.066 --> 01:45:04.927]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:45:05.187 --> 01:45:05.727]  Don't buy it.
[01:45:07.518 --> 01:45:07.998]  Well, I know.
[01:45:09.418 --> 01:45:15.500]  Practically, the only thing electronic I use anymore is a shortwave radio.
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:21.141]  I watch very little television, even when I do go to occasional movies.
[01:45:23.201 --> 01:45:24.121]  I did last night.
[01:45:24.201 --> 01:45:26.722]  Do not let your children see Matrix Revolutions.
[01:45:26.802 --> 01:45:28.042]  It's total New World Order.
[01:45:28.342 --> 01:45:29.363]  Worse than the last one.
[01:45:30.623 --> 01:45:31.603]  I would add that.
[01:45:32.743 --> 01:45:36.344]  No, it's horrible, but the globalist plan states, Bill...
[01:45:37.810 --> 01:45:42.134]  That this is about getting control of us by destroying our economics.
[01:45:42.154 --> 01:45:44.375]  If you don't have a middle class, you don't have a free society.
[01:45:44.716 --> 01:45:45.176]  Exactly.
[01:45:45.756 --> 01:45:48.779]  And there was something else, something I wanted to ask you.
[01:45:48.959 --> 01:45:55.324]  I heard, I guess it was yesterday, when you were talking to Jack McClam, and I think you re-ran a portion of that earlier today?
[01:45:56.024 --> 01:45:56.304]  Yes.
[01:45:56.324 --> 01:46:02.149]  You said something about the head of the Ford Foundation had made a statement back in 1954 about wanting to...
[01:46:05.983 --> 01:46:08.585]  Reduce the standard of living in the United States?
[01:46:09.266 --> 01:46:18.212]  Yeah, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, they had stuff in the 30s about lowering the standard of living worldwide, having a world tax, a world government.
[01:46:18.892 --> 01:46:20.613]  This has been a long-term plan.
[01:46:20.854 --> 01:46:24.216]  Who specifically was it that you were referring to at that time?
[01:46:24.236 --> 01:46:32.962]  I'd like to know where I could get... I've actually read and had dozens of guests on about the church committee hearings in the Senate in the 50s and 60s about...
[01:46:34.983 --> 01:46:44.470]  The stuff that's gone on with the Ford Foundation, their statements, their plans, they've got the new states project.
[01:46:44.730 --> 01:46:45.851]  This is all public, sir.
[01:46:45.891 --> 01:46:47.592]  It's what's in NAFTA and GATT.
[01:46:47.652 --> 01:46:48.492]  I don't have it in front of me.
[01:46:48.612 --> 01:46:51.574]  Is it on some website on the Internet?
[01:46:51.594 --> 01:46:58.339]  Yeah, I mean, if you type in Tax-Free Foundations plans to lower standard of living, you'll get thousands of links.
[01:46:58.579 --> 01:47:01.661]  Just plans to lower standard of living on the Internet, then.
[01:47:02.121 --> 01:47:03.162]  That should find it, yes.
[01:47:03.934 --> 01:47:05.255]  It's the stated plan.
[01:47:05.936 --> 01:47:09.159]  It's the Communist Manifesto, the equal distribution of wealth.
[01:47:09.519 --> 01:47:09.919]  I know what.
[01:47:10.019 --> 01:47:16.245]  I have a copy of the Communist Manifesto that was given to us by one of our government teachers when I was in high school.
[01:47:16.645 --> 01:47:16.905]  All right.
[01:47:16.945 --> 01:47:17.706]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:17.746 --> 01:47:18.086]  Thank you.
[01:47:18.527 --> 01:47:18.847]  You bet.
[01:47:18.967 --> 01:47:28.555]  Read what's in the Communist Manifesto, and then compare it to what's in the Bill of Rights, and ask yourself, what is America closer to, the Communist Manifesto or the Bill of Rights?
[01:47:28.635 --> 01:47:29.576]  I think you'll be shocked.
[01:47:30.307 --> 01:47:31.007]  Is that a word, communize?
[01:48:00.823 --> 01:48:10.429]  Our wealth transferred to government, then government control is transferred over to the private banks and corporations, then you have neo-serfdom, feudalism.
[01:48:11.309 --> 01:48:12.330]  What they have in Mexico.
[01:48:12.650 --> 01:48:19.073]  They don't call Mexico fascist, they don't call it socialist, they don't call it... No, they call it a corrupt plutocracy.
[01:48:19.874 --> 01:48:23.136]  Just a ruling class with serfs under them.
[01:48:23.436 --> 01:48:24.757]  That's all the New World Order is.
[01:48:24.957 --> 01:48:27.178]  They try to confuse you with all this left-right stuff.
[01:48:28.109 --> 01:48:31.391]  That's just how left-right is how they administer the tyranny.
[01:48:32.752 --> 01:48:36.535]  Come back, go to Jack and Terry and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:48:38.156 --> 01:48:42.239]  I have produced a new film, Matrix of Evil, and it's over two hours long.
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:48.044]  Ron Paul, Congresswoman McKinney, Frank Morales on the police state, Colonel Craig Roberts, myself.
[01:48:49.090 --> 01:48:50.512]  We're good to go.
[01:49:00.808 --> 01:49:01.189]  We're good to go.
[01:49:20.249 --> 01:49:21.530]  I've ordered out of chaos.
[01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:29.153]  Just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, or call toll-free to order 1-888-253-3139.
[01:49:43.203 --> 01:49:43.883]  Again, that number.
[01:49:44.003 --> 01:49:45.644]  Operators are there right now.
[01:49:45.664 --> 01:49:47.485]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:49:48.886 --> 01:49:55.329]  Or go to infowars.com to order via our secure online shopping cart.
[01:49:55.849 --> 01:49:57.070]  And Prison Planet's up.
[01:49:58.130 --> 01:50:01.592]  Just the DNS number's been rerouted purposely by the United Nations.
[01:50:01.612 --> 01:50:03.513]  That's who runs the ICANN system.
[01:50:04.413 --> 01:50:05.114]  This is official.
[01:50:06.975 --> 01:50:08.835]  And so it'll be back up soon.
[01:50:08.876 --> 01:50:10.076]  If you just go to prisonplanet.com.
[01:50:10.116 --> 01:50:11.597]  If not, go to infowars.com and...
[01:50:12.339 --> 01:50:13.601]  Read what they don't want you to see.
[01:50:13.621 --> 01:50:15.123]  Hear what they don't want you to see.
[01:50:15.704 --> 01:50:19.428]  Watch the video clips they don't want you to see by linking through at Infowars.com.
[01:50:21.306 --> 01:50:21.967]  We're good to go.
[01:50:46.005 --> 01:50:56.471]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:50:56.772 --> 01:50:57.252]  That's right.
[01:50:57.452 --> 01:51:04.556]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:04.856 --> 01:51:08.939]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter.
[01:51:09.039 --> 01:51:09.580]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:22.222 --> 01:51:29.608]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:51:29.888 --> 01:51:34.632]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:51:34.832 --> 01:51:40.497]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:51:40.717 --> 01:51:45.259]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:51:45.479 --> 01:51:52.622]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:51:52.642 --> 01:51:57.184]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:51:57.344 --> 01:51:59.885]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:52:00.085 --> 01:52:06.808]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:52:07.108 --> 01:52:07.348]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:52:21.997 --> 01:52:24.698]  Are you having problems with the high cost of prescription medications?
[01:52:24.838 --> 01:52:25.299]  Who isn't?
[01:52:25.479 --> 01:52:26.699]  Perhaps it's privacy issues.
[01:52:26.839 --> 01:52:31.022]  Either way, grab a pen and write this number down.
[01:52:31.042 --> 01:52:31.762]  1-800-615-7094.
[01:52:32.482 --> 01:52:34.403]  That's 1-800-615-7094.
[01:52:34.503 --> 01:52:38.205]  That's a toll free call that will lead you to the online pharmacy.
[01:52:38.285 --> 01:52:41.627]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name brand medications.
[01:52:41.747 --> 01:52:45.529]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[01:52:45.649 --> 01:52:46.069]  We're good to go.
[01:53:15.929 --> 01:53:17.430]  All right.
[01:53:17.490 --> 01:53:30.694]  Let's go to Jack in Michigan.
[01:53:30.714 --> 01:53:31.355]  You're on the air.
[01:53:31.395 --> 01:53:31.835]  Go ahead.
[01:53:33.035 --> 01:53:33.676]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:53:34.176 --> 01:53:40.338]  I'd like to know what you could tell me about the MJTF and the Northwood project.
[01:53:41.889 --> 01:53:43.451]  Well, that's two separate issues.
[01:53:43.511 --> 01:53:56.970]  Multi-jurisdictional task forces are federalized local police, county police, city police, all under federal control in these roving drug raid operations, now moving into gun raid operations.
[01:53:57.871 --> 01:54:09.041]  And states have passed laws to federalize things where if the police do a drug raid and they give it to the state, the county, they don't get really any of the money, maybe 10%.
[01:54:09.081 --> 01:54:11.282]  But if they give it to the feds, they get about 95%.
[01:54:12.223 --> 01:54:16.567]  That's designed to make sure that the local police get federalized.
[01:54:17.067 --> 01:54:19.409]  The Northwoods plan is on Infowars.com.
[01:54:20.370 --> 01:54:20.590]  Mm-hmm.
[01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:49.171]  Can you tell me when this MJTF was actually established?
[01:54:49.231 --> 01:54:53.372]  When did they actually start this situation?
[01:54:53.392 --> 01:54:55.933]  Yeah, about 25 years ago it started in L.A.
[01:54:55.973 --> 01:55:02.094]  and New York as a CIA pilot project, and it's become very prolific in the last decade.
[01:55:02.714 --> 01:55:03.074]  Okay.
[01:55:03.635 --> 01:55:10.396]  Yeah, I'm just wondering, the area that we live in here, we do have a Northwood psychiatric hospital here.
[01:55:10.816 --> 01:55:13.577]  Okay, I thought you were talking about the Northwoods Project, sir.
[01:55:14.244 --> 01:55:17.685]  Yeah, I'm just kind of connecting a few things together here.
[01:55:18.505 --> 01:55:27.527]  And also I was wanting to know, the TV situation, the television, are they now using this as a two-way camera?
[01:55:29.488 --> 01:55:35.109]  The high-definition television, when hooked into digital cable, can be used, some of them, as a camera.
[01:55:35.169 --> 01:55:37.050]  This is mainstream news.
[01:55:37.130 --> 01:55:38.230]  Already your digital...
[01:55:39.279 --> 01:55:41.681]  Already your digital cable has a microphone in it.
[01:55:41.721 --> 01:55:42.542]  This is mainstream.
[01:55:43.083 --> 01:55:51.310]  Homeland Security, quote, according to Television Weekly, can listen to, and by the way, that's in the new film, can listen to you with it.
[01:55:51.650 --> 01:55:52.771]  Also, let me finish.
[01:55:52.791 --> 01:55:53.912]  Yes, important question.
[01:55:54.532 --> 01:55:59.236]  OnStar is hooked into Homeland Security because the satellites it uses are federal.
[01:55:59.256 --> 01:56:00.237]  They can tune in and listen to you.
[01:56:00.257 --> 01:56:01.358]  There's a microphone in your car.
[01:56:01.738 --> 01:56:02.659]  If you have OnStar.
[01:56:02.779 --> 01:56:03.640]  If you have OnStar.
[01:56:04.301 --> 01:56:05.822]  And so across the board, yes.
[01:56:06.103 --> 01:56:07.524]  Stuff right out of 1984.
[01:56:07.985 --> 01:56:08.265]  Okay.
[01:56:08.646 --> 01:56:09.106]  Go ahead now.
[01:56:09.126 --> 01:56:12.510]  So when was the Northwood Project actually started?
[01:56:12.590 --> 01:56:13.531]  What time was that?
[01:56:13.551 --> 01:56:15.693]  You have like a date when they started that?
[01:56:15.754 --> 01:56:16.354]  Yes, 1962.
[01:56:16.414 --> 01:56:17.075]  That was 1962?
[01:56:17.816 --> 01:56:21.560]  And Kennedy said no to the plan, moved to abolish the CIA, and was assassinated.
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:22.121]  Uh-huh.
[01:56:22.541 --> 01:56:22.621]  Okay.
[01:56:23.041 --> 01:56:28.483]  And then we saw the fake Gulf of Tonkin attack two years later to get us into Vietnam.
[01:56:28.523 --> 01:56:36.205]  We saw the USS Liberty attack to try to blame the sinking of that ship, which did not take place.
[01:56:36.545 --> 01:56:37.325]  They kept it afloat.
[01:56:37.645 --> 01:56:38.926]  That was to be blamed on Egypt.
[01:56:38.946 --> 01:56:39.766]  This is now official.
[01:56:40.592 --> 01:56:47.941]  Okay, the MJTF, is there anybody that has an actual copy of that or availability for anybody to get that?
[01:56:47.961 --> 01:56:49.803]  Multijurisdictional task forces are everywhere.
[01:56:49.823 --> 01:56:50.564]  They're in your county.
[01:56:50.944 --> 01:56:51.705]  They're in your city.
[01:56:51.765 --> 01:56:53.106]  It's all over your newspaper.
[01:56:53.126 --> 01:56:54.268]  You can go talk to the city about it.
[01:56:54.588 --> 01:56:59.173]  No, this was actually done underground at Iron Mountain, wasn't it?
[01:56:59.193 --> 01:57:01.336]  I think you might be confused with terms and stuff.
[01:57:01.934 --> 01:57:03.275]  Like, Northwood's a common term.
[01:57:03.315 --> 01:57:07.619]  You know, there's Northwood's apartments, Northwood's supermarkets, Northwood's whatever.
[01:57:07.919 --> 01:57:22.531]  Okay, now, what I'm referring to, the report that was done at Iron Mountain, the nuclear survival underground camp, was that the project, MJTF, that was done at Northwood?
[01:57:23.231 --> 01:57:25.133]  I think you're confusing terms.
[01:57:25.253 --> 01:57:26.994]  These are all separate issues.
[01:57:27.034 --> 01:57:27.735]  Iron Mountain?
[01:57:28.713 --> 01:57:29.494]  Separate issues.
[01:57:29.914 --> 01:57:30.855]  They're separate issues.
[01:57:31.115 --> 01:57:33.696]  Yeah, I mean, unless you're talking about something else that's MJTF.
[01:57:34.777 --> 01:57:44.203]  Well, I'm just wondering, I got a hold of a tape that a person had given me, and it had the MJTF report on there that was done at Iron Mountain.
[01:57:45.177 --> 01:57:48.158]  It was about the underground nuclear survival camp.
[01:57:48.218 --> 01:57:50.679]  It was like a 15-panel member.
[01:57:50.719 --> 01:57:54.640]  Yeah, we know Iron Mountain's real, but again, I'd have to have the document in front of me.
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:55.301]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:55.341 --> 01:57:56.661]  I really appreciate it.
[01:57:56.701 --> 01:58:03.044]  We'll be back with the third hour here in just 70 seconds after this quick break in the station ID, network ID.
[01:58:03.704 --> 01:58:06.945]  And we'll come back with your calls and a bunch of other news, so stay with me.

[01:58:41.564 --> 01:58:42.385]  You want answers?
[01:58:43.145 --> 01:58:44.046]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:44.066 --> 01:58:48.371]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:48.891 --> 01:58:53.015]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:54.236 --> 01:58:55.457]  All right, my friends.
[01:58:55.818 --> 01:59:04.026]  Already into the third hour of this live Thursday edition.
[01:59:05.856 --> 01:59:11.578]  We've got wide open phones and a ton of other really important news about Iraq, the economy, you name it, coming up.
[01:59:12.518 --> 01:59:14.198]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:59:14.218 --> 01:59:15.819]  Let's talk to Terry in Colorado.
[01:59:15.839 --> 01:59:16.679]  Terry, you're on the air.
[01:59:16.719 --> 01:59:17.039]  Welcome.
[01:59:17.639 --> 01:59:18.379]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:18.619 --> 01:59:18.919]  Hello.
[01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:24.681]  I want to give a big thank you to you Texans that were out there protesting Fox last night.
[01:59:26.421 --> 01:59:27.622]  I love it.
[01:59:27.742 --> 01:59:28.382]  I'm amazed.
[01:59:28.822 --> 01:59:32.183]  I'm thrilled the people in Phoenix did it, and we're waiting for this guy to show up in Denver.
[01:59:32.858 --> 01:59:34.059]  What are you going to do when he gets to Denver?
[01:59:34.079 --> 01:59:39.742]  Well, we don't even know if he's coming, but, you know, you've put out the plans, and we've been reading on the Internet what's going on.
[01:59:40.223 --> 01:59:45.946]  And I just want to point out, yesterday when you said you were going to be protesting, I sent an email to Glenn Spencer's website.
[01:59:46.607 --> 01:59:52.170]  And they went on your website and couldn't find any notice of your demonstration, or we would have had that all over the country very fast.
[01:59:52.771 --> 01:59:57.474]  Well, what happened is, is Fox was going to come in August, and we were going to protest, and he canceled.
[01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:04.063]  And then, you know, I'm so busy, I can't really have all the demonstrations do everything.
[02:00:04.824 --> 02:00:10.947]  And so a caller called in the day before yesterday and said, Fox is coming, let's protest.
[02:00:10.987 --> 02:00:11.868]  And I said, okay.
[02:00:12.168 --> 02:00:13.649]  So I announced it once or twice.
[02:00:13.729 --> 02:00:20.272]  And, yeah, we should have, if we'd have promoted that for a couple weeks, there would have been 500 people out there and we should have done it.
[02:00:20.572 --> 02:00:26.956]  And even if you put it on your website the day of, many of us will take it down, send it around the country, it will be posted on websites.com.
[02:00:27.443 --> 02:00:33.707]  As far as I know, it was posted on Glenn Spencer's website, AmericanPatrol.com, and one out of North Carolina.
[02:00:33.887 --> 02:00:35.288]  Oh, the protest was posted.
[02:00:35.308 --> 02:00:35.568]  Good.
[02:00:35.728 --> 02:00:40.091]  Yes, and StopTheInvasion.com, but nobody could confirm it because it wasn't on yours, and that's fine.
[02:00:40.111 --> 02:00:45.335]  You got what I saw today on AmericanPatrol.com, which is Glenn Spencer's site.
[02:00:45.715 --> 02:00:48.477]  Was it that, I think, a San Antonio news?
[02:00:49.233 --> 02:00:52.934]  Yeah, that's not true.
[02:00:52.954 --> 02:00:55.936]  And so that must have been their online version because I didn't see that in their paper.
[02:00:56.276 --> 02:00:58.336]  Well, you know, I've seen the newspapers.
[02:00:58.396 --> 02:00:59.277]  Most of us skip them.
[02:00:59.317 --> 02:01:01.378]  That's why we like to go onto websites.
[02:01:01.818 --> 02:01:07.960]  And Glenn Spencer has been so successful because he takes his own photographers, his own video cams,
[02:01:08.484 --> 02:01:12.007]  And then he posted on his website... Well, it's all staff.
[02:01:12.267 --> 02:01:13.108]  Yeah.
[02:01:13.428 --> 02:01:14.890]  And it's all staffing issues.
[02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:25.118]  I need everybody, if you find any articles, San Antonio News Press News, Statesman, video clips on the local news channels, email those links to tips at infowars.com.
[02:01:30.131 --> 02:01:33.072]  Tips at InfoWars.com, and we'll post all of those.
[02:01:33.252 --> 02:01:38.815]  And if you post those, we're going to have them posted all over the sites in the country that cover immigration.
[02:01:39.015 --> 02:01:40.075]  Well, I mean, let's be honest.
[02:01:40.115 --> 02:01:41.836]  I'd say there are about 50 people there.
[02:01:41.856 --> 02:01:42.796]  That's good.
[02:01:42.876 --> 02:01:43.516]  That's great.
[02:01:43.577 --> 02:01:46.738]  I mean, the whole point is we can have, you know, thousands at a gun rally.
[02:01:46.758 --> 02:01:50.379]  We didn't have much time, but there was no one there for Fox.
[02:01:50.959 --> 02:01:55.561]  Well, I love it, and I think when they said he got a warm welcome, what they meant is you put him on the hot seat.
[02:01:55.601 --> 02:01:56.942]  They just said it in a nice way.
[02:01:57.819 --> 02:01:59.721]  So what did the San Antonio Express News say?
[02:01:59.941 --> 02:02:07.228]  Well, it just kind of said the same things you were reading and you saw on the news, which was just pablum, just total New World Order stuff.
[02:02:07.248 --> 02:02:09.570]  What did it say the dozen protesters were saying?
[02:02:09.590 --> 02:02:13.154]  It said a dozen, and it was like one line saying there was a dozen protesters there.
[02:02:13.553 --> 02:02:19.096]  But those of us who've been at these protests know that the newspapers are really only good to find out what time the movies go.
[02:02:19.116 --> 02:02:21.237]  We've been at meetings with over 1,000 people.
[02:02:21.277 --> 02:02:21.697]  They'll say 100.
[02:02:21.757 --> 02:02:24.738]  I have forced the statesmen.
[02:02:25.179 --> 02:02:29.921]  I have gone in and shown them our video, counted the people, and made them do retractions.
[02:02:30.681 --> 02:02:32.922]  Well, it's not worth it if you put it on your website.
[02:02:32.962 --> 02:02:34.943]  We're not going to read these rags.
[02:02:34.983 --> 02:02:36.064]  We're going to read your website.
[02:02:36.144 --> 02:02:37.224]  Who do you think we're going to believe?
[02:02:37.244 --> 02:02:38.085]  We're going to believe you.
[02:02:38.105 --> 02:02:40.326]  I also want to say this.
[02:02:40.851 --> 02:02:51.215]  That if you take a look at the coverage in these rags nationally, the local Mexican consulate spokesmen are saying that we are merging our communities.
[02:02:51.255 --> 02:02:53.275]  We are merging our nations right now.
[02:02:53.315 --> 02:02:55.296]  They are literally saying merging.
[02:02:55.316 --> 02:02:57.137]  No, I mean, that's it.
[02:02:57.197 --> 02:02:58.097]  That's what's happening.
[02:02:58.337 --> 02:02:59.558]  They're getting rid of America.
[02:02:59.618 --> 02:03:01.138]  America's dying right in front of us.
[02:03:01.558 --> 02:03:03.539]  Carte blanche legalization of everybody.
[02:03:03.559 --> 02:03:06.060]  And it's horrible, Terry.
[02:03:06.946 --> 02:03:08.226]  I know, but you know, they're not merging.
[02:03:08.246 --> 02:03:12.848]  We're just going to move ahead and have our own, because I'm not moving in with a fox man.
[02:03:13.428 --> 02:03:14.708]  You don't want to be his slave?
[02:03:14.928 --> 02:03:20.190]  I'm not going to be, and I love that you're shouting that, and I love that you upset him, so thank you so much.
[02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:22.491]  Well, thank you for the call.
[02:03:23.351 --> 02:03:26.152]  Yeah, according to one of these articles, it said he was visibly upset.
[02:03:26.172 --> 02:03:27.652]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:03:28.292 --> 02:03:30.193]  I'm glad it's getting some coverage, better than nothing.
[02:03:32.219 --> 02:03:36.562]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:03:36.742 --> 02:03:41.165]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:03:41.325 --> 02:03:45.688]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:03:45.728 --> 02:03:47.069]  The New World Order.
[02:03:48.866 --> 02:03:53.092]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:53.152 --> 02:04:00.101]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:04:00.221 --> 02:04:02.264]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:04:02.624 --> 02:04:05.688]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[02:04:05.848 --> 02:04:12.933]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:04:13.213 --> 02:04:18.577]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:04:31.685 --> 02:04:40.553]  You are sick because you allow yourself to remain sick and you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw food.
[02:04:40.713 --> 02:04:42.074]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[02:04:42.234 --> 02:04:46.258]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[02:04:46.438 --> 02:04:52.223]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[02:04:52.688 --> 02:04:55.750]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.

[02:05:31.477 --> 02:05:33.139]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:05:33.159 --> 02:05:35.681]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:01.321]  of the self-sterilizing filters.

[02:06:28.399 --> 02:06:30.080]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:06:33.542 --> 02:06:39.565]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:06:40.185 --> 02:06:43.226]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:47.128 --> 02:06:54.032]  You know, when I'm wrong, I'll say it, and I really shouldn't sneak around the issues.
[02:06:56.933 --> 02:07:09.159]  I got on here in the last hour and I said that I had seen zero coverage in the newspapers and I did look through five different news articles of the major Texas papers and saw nothing about our protest.
[02:07:09.719 --> 02:07:16.382]  I did add the addendum that maybe there was a side blurb on the website or a side blurb in another article.
[02:07:16.822 --> 02:07:18.643]  I said, please help me find it.
[02:07:18.663 --> 02:07:20.204]  So I guess in a way I wasn't really wrong.
[02:07:21.154 --> 02:07:23.094]  But I don't like going off half-cocked.
[02:07:23.575 --> 02:07:50.300]  The point is, they still under-reported it, a line here, a line there, in a side blurb article or just on a website, and suppressed the fact that we were there bringing up legitimate issues about Vicente Fox's visit to Austin, Texas, where he's giving awards today to the police department and to Wells Fargo and others for, quote, helping ram through the matricula card program.
[02:07:51.764 --> 02:07:53.065]  That's racketeering, folks.
[02:07:53.125 --> 02:07:54.666]  That's organized crime.
[02:07:55.206 --> 02:07:58.088]  In masks, giving people awards for violating federal law.
[02:07:58.529 --> 02:08:00.050]  I can say that clearly.
[02:08:00.430 --> 02:08:01.831]  The truth is a total defense.
[02:08:02.671 --> 02:08:03.972]  They're engaging in crime.
[02:08:04.072 --> 02:08:08.235]  I don't care if they're the establishment and say, well, we've got a different set of laws for ourselves.
[02:08:10.256 --> 02:08:11.037]  It's amazing.
[02:08:11.097 --> 02:08:12.178]  It's absolutely amazing.
[02:08:12.218 --> 02:08:20.383]  And there are a bunch of states that are moving to make it a state crime for the police to do deals with Mexico and
[02:08:21.264 --> 02:08:26.446]  And not go after illegals or not go after businesses that hire illegals.
[02:08:27.306 --> 02:08:28.227]  It is a crime.
[02:08:28.747 --> 02:08:29.807]  It needs to be done.
[02:08:29.827 --> 02:08:41.731]  We need to move on our legislatures and block people like George Bush and Rick Perry and the socialistic Bill Clinton, Bill Richardson minion out of New Mexico.
[02:08:42.292 --> 02:08:45.273]  And Arnold, open borders, give me your guns, I love abortion.
[02:08:45.633 --> 02:08:46.393]  Schwarzenegger.
[02:08:47.434 --> 02:08:48.654]  We have got to do this, but
[02:08:49.893 --> 02:09:04.586]  It was, let's put it this way, I spent 30 minutes this morning, and normally I can find a story, bam, like that, looking with keyword searches, going to TV news sites, going to newspapers, scanning through articles, doing keyword searches in the articles, nothing about our protest.
[02:09:05.287 --> 02:09:09.871]  Now I've learned that at least in the San Antonio Express News, there was one line about there was a protest.
[02:09:10.772 --> 02:09:13.895]  In the Statesman, there was a secondary article saying there was a protest.
[02:09:14.694 --> 02:09:15.434]  A little blurb.
[02:09:16.115 --> 02:09:19.557]  News 8, I'm told, did a good job doing a piece on it.
[02:09:19.617 --> 02:09:20.357]  So that's good.
[02:09:20.397 --> 02:09:21.518]  That's better than nothing.
[02:09:21.558 --> 02:09:25.560]  I mean, I knew that they would kind of dampen it and underplay it.
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:26.500]  That's normal.
[02:09:26.521 --> 02:09:29.662]  But if there was a total blackout, I was going to be freaked out about that.
[02:09:30.042 --> 02:09:33.724]  But I did say, hey, you guys have got millions of eyes, millions of ears.
[02:09:34.105 --> 02:09:36.346]  Go check this out for me, or did you see this?
[02:09:36.406 --> 02:09:38.407]  And we got the calls on it.
[02:09:39.835 --> 02:09:55.363]  Before I go to Chris and Andrew and Mike and Justin and Wilma and others, before I do that and get into some other news and issues, I want to just tell you that two weeks ago they supposedly passed a partial birth abortion ban.
[02:09:56.183 --> 02:09:58.004]  That's where they pull the baby's head out of the womb.
[02:09:58.024 --> 02:09:59.104]  And I'm sorry if this is graphic.
[02:09:59.124 --> 02:09:59.565]  You need to know.
[02:09:59.605 --> 02:10:00.385]  It's murder, folks.
[02:10:00.925 --> 02:10:02.326]  They pull the baby's head out of the womb.
[02:10:02.346 --> 02:10:06.108]  We're talking an eight, nine-month-old baby could be adopted right there on the spot.
[02:10:06.832 --> 02:10:07.792]  No reason to do this.
[02:10:07.832 --> 02:10:17.297]  There's people lined up wanting babies, but they won't let the parents, you know, they'll encourage them to kill the children there instead of encouraging them to have the children.
[02:10:17.937 --> 02:10:21.198]  And then CPS will kidnap your child so somebody can have an adoptee.
[02:10:21.959 --> 02:10:23.199]  It's really a sick system.
[02:10:23.259 --> 02:10:33.263]  But to make a long story short, they pull a baby's head out, suck its brains out, crush the skull, sell it for medical experiments or for body parts, for collagen.
[02:10:33.824 --> 02:10:34.564]  That's what they do.
[02:10:36.315 --> 02:10:37.336]  No reason to do that.
[02:10:37.396 --> 02:10:43.041]  Even Dick Gephardt, two years ago, the last time they voted, even liberals said, yeah, we're against this.
[02:10:43.081 --> 02:10:44.202]  There's no reason to do this.
[02:10:45.243 --> 02:10:52.368]  And I heard the guy filling in Roger Hedgecock for Limbaugh go, well, it's one thing if you're just sucking something out or washing something out.
[02:10:52.809 --> 02:10:53.690]  Something out.
[02:10:54.230 --> 02:10:56.552]  A human being, buddy, that's an inch long.
[02:10:58.233 --> 02:11:01.196]  Oh, yeah, with a heart and a brain and arms and legs and fingerprints.
[02:11:02.846 --> 02:11:10.812]  Did you know a baby, when it's the size of a gummy bear, jumps up and down in the womb, boings, exercising like a little seahorse?
[02:11:12.033 --> 02:11:16.797]  So sick, so devilish, I heard that neocon, the Freudian slip.
[02:11:17.717 --> 02:11:25.784]  Oh, well, it's no big deal when it's an inch long, but these partial birth abortions... I don't know, maybe it was a figure of speech, but the point is...
[02:11:27.609 --> 02:11:30.131]  That it is not a partial birth abortion ban.
[02:11:30.151 --> 02:11:40.416]  They generally still suck the brain out in most partial birth abortions while it's still in the birth canal and collapse the head as it's coming through the cervix.
[02:11:41.237 --> 02:11:41.677]  Okay?
[02:11:43.398 --> 02:11:44.799]  That's where they collapse the head.
[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:52.263]  Sometimes the baby would go ahead and slip out, pop out, and they would have to kill it right there on the table.
[02:11:53.309 --> 02:11:54.450]  And I've talked to nurses.
[02:11:54.490 --> 02:11:55.411]  They've been on the show.
[02:11:55.491 --> 02:11:56.392]  Doctors have been on the show.
[02:11:56.412 --> 02:11:57.213]  They've been on the record.
[02:11:57.813 --> 02:11:59.675]  Many times they just kill the baby right on the table.
[02:11:59.715 --> 02:12:02.257]  It'll just come right on out because, you know, it's seven, eight months old.
[02:12:03.118 --> 02:12:04.238]  It's three or four pounds.
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:07.982]  And it goes ahead and comes out on the table.
[02:12:08.042 --> 02:12:13.706]  And because of some of the laws and regulations, they'll drop them in a bucket of water.
[02:12:14.827 --> 02:12:17.329]  Folks, we've had her on the show.
[02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:21.213]  There's a woman who was found by a Christian group in a dumpster
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:24.221]  Two days after she was thrown in the dumpster.
[02:12:25.781 --> 02:12:27.822]  Beautiful lady.
[02:12:27.882 --> 02:12:28.622]  I forget her name.
[02:12:28.642 --> 02:12:29.582]  I had her on like four years ago.
[02:12:29.602 --> 02:12:30.443]  I've got to get her back on.
[02:12:30.683 --> 02:12:35.344]  I saw a video on TV with her, Christian's show, and all the evidence of it in the news articles.
[02:12:35.564 --> 02:12:36.825]  She's like 20-something years old now.
[02:12:37.165 --> 02:12:37.865]  Long-haired lady.
[02:12:37.985 --> 02:12:39.325]  Call in with her name if you know her name.
[02:12:40.226 --> 02:12:43.286]  And she has a limp where they hacked into her thigh as a baby.
[02:12:43.927 --> 02:12:47.608]  She's a beautiful woman, but she has a limp where they almost half severed her leg.
[02:12:48.308 --> 02:12:51.629]  But the people dug her out of a trash can and went and secretly raised her
[02:12:52.890 --> 02:12:53.771]  And there's other people.
[02:12:54.451 --> 02:12:58.555]  But the point is, they didn't ban partial birth abortion, folks.
[02:12:59.115 --> 02:13:00.316]  It's smoke and mirrors.
[02:13:01.758 --> 02:13:02.538]  It's horrible.
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:06.862]  And Bush says we've finally done something for the unborn.
[02:13:08.043 --> 02:13:19.633]  They did that because we've put pressure on them and because the Republicans have the executive, the legislative, and the judicial branches, and so they've got to act like they're conservative.
[02:13:21.486 --> 02:13:24.567]  I want you to know, folks, people read the bills.
[02:13:24.627 --> 02:13:26.587]  It's not just myself who's read the bill and said this.
[02:13:26.968 --> 02:13:28.848]  They did not ban partial birth abortion.
[02:13:29.728 --> 02:13:31.509]  You can have a hollow victory if you want.
[02:13:33.009 --> 02:13:35.410]  Millions are still dying every year, folks.
[02:13:36.450 --> 02:13:37.710]  Let's go to Chris in Texas.
[02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:38.551]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:13:38.591 --> 02:13:38.991]  Go ahead.
[02:13:39.491 --> 02:13:40.531]  Hey, Alex.
[02:13:40.591 --> 02:13:41.872]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:13:42.332 --> 02:13:42.652]  You bet.
[02:13:44.241 --> 02:13:45.181]  I'm not their slave!
[02:13:45.802 --> 02:13:46.742]  I'm not their slave!
[02:13:46.762 --> 02:13:46.862]  Right.
[02:14:12.991 --> 02:14:25.787]  And I also want to say it's great to see our town speak out, because it may not be a percentage point or what, but even if it's 50 people, that's still more than 50 that weren't there.
[02:14:26.885 --> 02:14:28.767]  You know, speaking out against us.
[02:14:28.807 --> 02:14:34.430]  Look, they'll promote some government land-grab meeting for six months and 100 people will show up.
[02:14:34.931 --> 02:14:37.913]  We promote something for a month and hundreds or thousands show up.
[02:14:38.313 --> 02:14:42.836]  The point is that we're active, we're in their face, and we're not backing down.
[02:14:43.096 --> 02:14:44.777]  And we did put a mark on the news.
[02:14:45.277 --> 02:14:48.099]  We did get our voice out there and our opinion.
[02:14:48.319 --> 02:14:51.662]  We didn't just let them have a fluff piece about Vicente Foxx.
[02:14:52.482 --> 02:14:55.103]  I also want to thank Radio Free Austin.
[02:14:55.123 --> 02:15:00.445]  That's how I found out about it on 91.1 to the local listeners here in Austin.
[02:15:01.746 --> 02:15:08.289]  I guess there's another station on 90.1 in South Austin, but because of that, that's how I found out about it.
[02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:14.371]  Also, about the TV footage, I was watching last night and K.I.
[02:15:14.431 --> 02:15:14.751]  showed it.
[02:15:16.700 --> 02:15:19.522]  They showed footage of you, and they showed Fox.
[02:15:20.123 --> 02:15:28.269]  And during his speech, you can hear you shouting over him with your bullhorn, and you can see it in Fox's face, getting really annoyed.
[02:15:30.090 --> 02:15:31.431]  What time was that news piece?
[02:15:32.012 --> 02:15:36.815]  I'm thinking 10, their 10 o'clock roll time, whatever that was, 10, 10.30.
[02:15:38.427 --> 02:15:42.749]  Well, for whoever taped this in Austin, please have it up there tonight at the 7 o'clock TV show.
[02:15:43.110 --> 02:15:43.830]  Yeah, so KI.
[02:15:44.090 --> 02:15:44.810]  KI did have that.
[02:15:44.830 --> 02:15:46.311]  Well, I did talk to the KI cameraman.
[02:15:46.331 --> 02:15:49.033]  I don't want to get him in trouble, but he's definitely a good guy.
[02:15:49.053 --> 02:15:49.473]  Yeah.
[02:15:50.317 --> 02:15:54.340]  And, of course, great job at Austin City Council for getting rid of the Patriot Act.
[02:15:54.460 --> 02:15:57.482]  Well, we showed up four times, hundreds of people each time.
[02:15:58.683 --> 02:16:00.304]  There's over 100 seats.
[02:16:00.344 --> 02:16:01.185]  They were all filled.
[02:16:01.405 --> 02:16:02.946]  Oh, yeah, it was a standing room.
[02:16:02.986 --> 02:16:03.467]  I was there.
[02:16:03.727 --> 02:16:08.951]  A hundred people signed up to speak, and the statesman, I think, said there were over a dozen people there.
[02:16:09.351 --> 02:16:09.591]  Mm-hmm.
[02:16:10.091 --> 02:16:11.212]  So, I mean, that's what they do.
[02:16:11.272 --> 02:16:11.933]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:16:12.553 --> 02:16:13.534]  Here's a thought.
[02:16:13.594 --> 02:16:16.796]  I mean, hey, you don't have a drug problem.
[02:16:16.816 --> 02:16:18.938]  Why don't you go to KLBJ and take Russia's Hour?
[02:16:20.901 --> 02:16:22.162]  That's not going to happen, my friend.
[02:16:22.222 --> 02:16:22.923]  I know, I know.
[02:16:24.564 --> 02:16:25.885]  Texas Monthly owns that.
[02:16:25.925 --> 02:16:31.729]  They bought it from the crone Lady Bloodbird.
[02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:37.674]  Oh, TMT owns the whole KLBJ broadcasting studio?
[02:16:37.774 --> 02:16:39.956]  Yes, Texas Monthly bought it.
[02:16:40.436 --> 02:16:41.797]  Okay, okay.
[02:16:41.837 --> 02:16:42.477]  Michael Lavely?
[02:16:43.518 --> 02:16:46.721]  Yes, LBJS was bought out about a month ago.
[02:16:47.741 --> 02:16:48.082]  Okay.
[02:16:48.262 --> 02:16:49.703]  So it's going to be even worse now.
[02:16:50.647 --> 02:16:51.867]  Believe me, I've heard the difference.
[02:16:52.548 --> 02:16:53.148]  Right, right.
[02:16:53.168 --> 02:16:55.609]  I mean, you know, it's commie light now.
[02:16:55.629 --> 02:16:58.029]  Hey, I appreciate the call, bud.
[02:16:58.169 --> 02:16:58.869]  Yeah, you take care.
[02:16:59.110 --> 02:17:01.750]  Hey, take care, and I appreciate everybody coming out to the demonstration last night.
[02:17:02.531 --> 02:17:06.472]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andrew, and Andrew's calling us from Maryland.
[02:17:06.512 --> 02:17:07.052]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:17:07.532 --> 02:17:08.612]  Hey, Alex, how's it going today?
[02:17:08.772 --> 02:17:09.052]  Good.
[02:17:09.132 --> 02:17:09.653]  Thanks for calling.
[02:17:09.993 --> 02:17:10.493]  Oh, you're welcome.
[02:17:10.533 --> 02:17:11.433]  It sounds like a great show.
[02:17:11.773 --> 02:17:17.695]  Listen, I got a couple of things I wanted to talk about, one I want to email you about, because it's a long and complex intro that I have to do.
[02:17:18.708 --> 02:17:27.633]  About the police state and things like that, and the work I do, I deal with a lot of law enforcement types, a lot of good guys, do really good work, really dedicated.
[02:17:27.953 --> 02:17:38.759]  How do we winnow out the good from the bad and make sure that, you know, empowered by a lot of the technology you were talking about earlier, there's a lot of good work that can be done to put real bad guys out of business.
[02:17:39.226 --> 02:17:40.187]  Well, let me boil it down.
[02:17:40.367 --> 02:17:41.648]  Yeah, I mean, what do we do here?
[02:17:41.868 --> 02:17:45.130]  And I'll hold you over if we need to, because this is an important question.
[02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:48.012]  Last night I started screaming at police with my bullhorn.
[02:17:48.292 --> 02:17:48.492]  Right.
[02:17:48.772 --> 02:17:50.533]  Because I'm like a dog, a big dog.
[02:17:50.573 --> 02:17:55.336]  If another big dog puts his hackles up and comes over to me growling, I'm going to do it again.
[02:17:55.416 --> 02:17:55.977]  You bark back.
[02:17:55.997 --> 02:17:56.637]  I'm going to do it.
[02:17:56.677 --> 02:17:57.578]  And they were doing that.
[02:17:58.218 --> 02:17:59.439]  And I guess they can't help it.
[02:17:59.499 --> 02:18:05.121]  They see it as a threat when I'm sticking my chest out yelling at the governor and El Presidente.
[02:18:05.601 --> 02:18:07.142]  And we had them get in our face and stuff.
[02:18:07.202 --> 02:18:08.402]  Not all of them, but some of them.
[02:18:08.422 --> 02:18:10.383]  And then I went after all of them.
[02:18:10.783 --> 02:18:13.304]  And I just want them to know how would they like being treated like that.
[02:18:13.644 --> 02:18:16.846]  So I fall into the trap of alienating police sometimes.
[02:18:17.046 --> 02:18:18.046]  Jack McClam doesn't.
[02:18:18.366 --> 02:18:20.467]  And I'll talk about how we reach out to them on the other side.
[02:18:20.887 --> 02:18:22.288]  But things are too late in the game.
[02:18:22.328 --> 02:18:23.669]  We're losing America, folks.
[02:18:23.889 --> 02:18:26.810]  And I can't apologize for getting my hackles up.
[02:18:27.370 --> 02:18:27.930]  So stay there.
[02:18:27.970 --> 02:18:31.391]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:18:32.211 --> 02:18:32.651]  Gold.
[02:18:33.011 --> 02:18:34.271]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:34.531 --> 02:18:40.632]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:40.813 --> 02:18:44.633]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:44.993 --> 02:18:46.874]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:46.934 --> 02:18:49.214]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:49.354 --> 02:18:54.235]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a feeble...
[02:18:54.275 --> 02:18:54.736]  We're good to go.

[02:22:39.581 --> 02:22:42.384]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:43.665 --> 02:22:47.108]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:22:47.809 --> 02:22:48.629]  We're here live.
[02:22:48.649 --> 02:22:56.436]  And I'm telling you, you can take over any press conference, any news event, and at least have some of your information.
[02:22:56.496 --> 02:22:57.337]  Get out to the people.
[02:22:58.018 --> 02:22:59.379]  If you'll just buy a bullhorn...
[02:23:00.245 --> 02:23:12.310]  Get a cable access show, get a weekend radio show, put up a website, start taking action on the Second Amendment, land rights, the electronic voting machines, on any of these key issues, on abortion.
[02:23:13.511 --> 02:23:21.154]  People were getting affected with abortion, and that's why they tried to say it's racketeering for 10 people to go protest an abortion clinic 100 feet away.
[02:23:22.255 --> 02:23:24.456]  But again, that's been challenged in court and overturned.
[02:23:25.117 --> 02:23:27.017]  So we've got to get involved.
[02:23:27.037 --> 02:23:28.498]  We've got to stand up to the evil.
[02:23:28.578 --> 02:23:34.139]  Now, Andrew in Maryland was asking how we wake police up.
[02:23:34.419 --> 02:23:36.419]  This is a very complex question, but look.
[02:23:37.699 --> 02:23:39.560]  Police are brainwashing the academies.
[02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:41.900]  They're told it's us against them for their own good.
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:46.921]  It's a thin blue line because the public's so dangerous and we've all got to stick together.
[02:23:46.981 --> 02:23:48.701]  It's a gang mentality.
[02:23:48.741 --> 02:23:52.142]  They should read their own gang handbooks and then realize that they're in a gang
[02:23:52.962 --> 02:23:54.144]  And follow their oath.
[02:23:54.304 --> 02:24:04.774]  Read the oath that they swore and start researching the New World Order and find out what the plan is of the globalists for America and then ask themselves, is this something I want to be involved in?
[02:24:05.054 --> 02:24:07.777]  If I'm going to be a criminal, I might as well go rob banks.
[02:24:07.877 --> 02:24:10.640]  If you're going to be a criminal, cops, go ahead and rob banks.
[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:11.401]  Go all the way.
[02:24:12.625 --> 02:24:13.526]  That's my point here.
[02:24:13.566 --> 02:24:15.227]  You're engaging in criminal activity.
[02:24:15.288 --> 02:24:17.169]  I don't care if the government says it's okay.
[02:24:17.469 --> 02:24:20.652]  That's like the government saying black people are slaves because we say so.
[02:24:20.932 --> 02:24:26.136]  It doesn't make it right and doesn't mean that blacks have to put the plow around their neck and drag it.
[02:24:26.276 --> 02:24:27.877]  They've got a right to stand up against it.
[02:24:27.897 --> 02:24:28.698]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:32.721]  Does that answer your question, Andrew?
[02:24:33.322 --> 02:24:33.702]  It does.
[02:24:33.862 --> 02:24:34.282]  It does.
[02:24:36.084 --> 02:24:36.364]  I'm sorry.
[02:24:36.384 --> 02:24:39.486]  I wasn't aware that we were still on air, but I was riveted on the phone.
[02:24:41.320 --> 02:24:58.911]  I guess also part of my question is, from the side of the citizenry, what are your suggestions as far as discerning police leaders who are truly trying to fight the good fight and people we need to be more cautious of?
[02:24:58.971 --> 02:25:04.155]  Well, as Jack McClam said, if you're in a major city of over a million people, you have got a CIA agent there.
[02:25:05.854 --> 02:25:07.475]  I'm talking 98% of the time.
[02:25:07.495 --> 02:25:07.936]  Okay.
[02:25:07.956 --> 02:25:09.137]  We've got all shows on this.
[02:25:09.597 --> 02:25:12.519]  They all come from New York, Chicago, or L.A.
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:13.200]  Okay.
[02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:15.962]  Those were the first CIA bases, organized crime bases.
[02:25:16.362 --> 02:25:18.904]  You notice they're all from California, Illinois, or New York.
[02:25:18.924 --> 02:25:20.726]  Now, how do you think that goes?
[02:25:20.746 --> 02:25:23.868]  Do you think this is like MKUltra British intelligence type stuff, or...?
[02:25:23.988 --> 02:25:24.388]  Well, N.K.
[02:25:24.408 --> 02:25:36.321]  Alter is a particular mind control CIA program that was declassified in 77, but I would call it more of a, it's an infiltration to federalize local departments to get federal control.
[02:25:36.621 --> 02:25:36.862]  Okay.
[02:25:37.364 --> 02:25:40.606]  Because if you're going to control a population, it starts at the local level.
[02:25:41.086 --> 02:25:44.829]  So we've had a CIA takeover of major police departments.
[02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:48.551]  That ensures uniformity and that everybody's on the same page.
[02:25:48.591 --> 02:25:50.613]  And then they come out and sign on to all the deals.
[02:25:50.653 --> 02:25:54.015]  They fly all the police chiefs to New York for these big dinners every year.
[02:25:54.395 --> 02:25:56.677]  They learn what the latest and greatest thing is to do.
[02:25:57.137 --> 02:26:00.779]  Hey, get this through and you'll get a federal scholarship.
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:03.281]  Our last police chief, this woman...
[02:26:03.781 --> 02:26:03.921]  Okay.
[02:26:03.961 --> 02:26:04.101]  Okay.
[02:26:26.109 --> 02:26:27.570]  Well, that was also going to be one of my questions.
[02:26:27.630 --> 02:26:35.473]  And another way they control is, notice they run for sheriff or push for police chief, former FBI agents or BATF.
[02:26:35.493 --> 02:26:36.033]  You notice that?
[02:26:36.293 --> 02:26:36.573]  Okay, yeah.
[02:26:36.593 --> 02:26:37.554]  Yeah, I've seen that.
[02:26:39.215 --> 02:26:43.456]  Yeah, because that was going to be one of my other questions is, you know, if they're in the criminal gang, where's the payoff?
[02:26:43.476 --> 02:26:44.717]  Because we know it's not the paycheck.
[02:26:45.956 --> 02:26:49.738]  Well, I'd say about half your police chiefs are on the narcotics dole.
[02:26:49.778 --> 02:26:51.598]  It's probably more than that, but let's be conservative.
[02:26:51.838 --> 02:26:52.179]  Okay.
[02:26:52.239 --> 02:26:53.399]  And they get caught all the time.
[02:26:53.699 --> 02:26:54.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:56.780]  A lot of other ones get land deals.
[02:26:56.821 --> 02:27:06.004]  The way they pay people off is they'll, a buddy of the city, a private businessman who's in drug dealing, will sell land worth a million bucks for $200,000 to the police chief.
[02:27:06.044 --> 02:27:06.164]  Okay.
[02:27:07.945 --> 02:27:08.025]  Okay.
[02:27:08.046 --> 02:27:11.130]  Then the police chief turns around a year later and sells it for a million and a half.
[02:27:11.631 --> 02:27:16.378]  Or the police chief can own land that isn't worth $100,000 and he gets a million bucks for it.
[02:27:16.759 --> 02:27:16.999]  Right.
[02:27:17.259 --> 02:27:18.942]  That's another payoff system.
[02:27:19.703 --> 02:27:20.084]  Okay.
[02:27:21.345 --> 02:27:23.609]  And would you suggest researching through the...
[02:27:24.096 --> 02:27:27.238]  The municipality's land records to uncover those threads?
[02:27:27.679 --> 02:27:29.000]  You will find them everywhere.
[02:27:29.260 --> 02:27:32.462]  If you scratch the surface, pus will just squirt out.
[02:27:32.742 --> 02:27:33.543]  Okay, okay.
[02:27:33.563 --> 02:27:38.026]  And I hate to use that analogy, but it's like a giant rotten possum on the side of the road.
[02:27:38.046 --> 02:27:39.207]  Nice.
[02:27:43.430 --> 02:27:48.094]  The other thing I was going to ask about was, I'm a commercial fraud investigator.
[02:27:48.863 --> 02:27:59.231]  And the kind of things that you were talking about, I'm just coming into the fold, so to speak, or just becoming aware of the extent to which the American people are not only irritated, but are aware of their irritation and the sources of it.
[02:27:59.251 --> 02:28:05.676]  Well, then you understand the frustration of understanding a criminal enterprise, but in two minutes trying to present it to people.
[02:28:08.504 --> 02:28:09.465]  Do you see what I'm saying, Andrew?
[02:28:09.485 --> 02:28:09.785]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:09.965 --> 02:28:10.266]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:10.466 --> 02:28:18.352]  Tell you what, I want to hear about your investigations as a fraud investigator when we get back, and we'll go to Mike and Justin and a few others, and I'm going to hit some other news.
[02:28:18.753 --> 02:28:19.834]  Stay with us, though, Andrew.
[02:28:22.616 --> 02:28:23.517]  We're on the march.
[02:28:24.017 --> 02:28:25.619]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:28:26.539 --> 02:28:29.242]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:32.805 --> 02:28:37.513]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:28:38.014 --> 02:28:41.140]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[02:28:41.795 --> 02:28:47.757]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[02:28:48.237 --> 02:28:51.859]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:28:52.299 --> 02:28:54.980]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:59.201]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[02:28:59.662 --> 02:29:03.603]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the month that it aired.
[02:29:04.147 --> 02:29:04.707]  We're good to go.
[02:29:32.549 --> 02:29:36.012]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:29:36.292 --> 02:29:39.795]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[02:29:50.625 --> 02:29:58.532]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:29:58.932 --> 02:30:04.277]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:30:04.437 --> 02:30:08.200]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[02:30:17.889 --> 02:30:23.433]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:30:26.596 --> 02:30:28.116]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:30:28.176 --> 02:30:30.657]  Protect your family.
[02:30:32.257 --> 02:30:34.978]  Are you having problems with the high cost of prescription medications?
[02:30:35.118 --> 02:30:35.558]  Who isn't?
[02:30:35.758 --> 02:30:36.978]  Perhaps it's privacy issues.
[02:30:37.098 --> 02:30:40.419]  Either way, grab a pen and write this number down.
[02:30:40.439 --> 02:30:41.319]  1-800-615-7094.
[02:30:42.739 --> 02:30:45.120]  That's 1-800-615-7094.
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:48.480]  That's a toll-free call that will lead you to the online pharmacy.
[02:30:48.561 --> 02:30:51.901]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name brand medications.
[02:30:52.001 --> 02:30:55.782]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[02:30:56.762 --> 02:31:08.448]  It's quick, it's easy, and it saves you money on popular name-brand medications like diet pills and muscle relaxers, or painkillers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[02:31:08.508 --> 02:31:14.451]  You'll save money on anti-anxiety medications, heartburn relief, or allergy control, all without having to go to the doctor's office.
[02:31:14.691 --> 02:31:17.792]  All right, let's move quickly to the calls because I do have some other news I want to get to.
[02:31:42.347 --> 02:31:43.107]  We have time.
[02:31:43.127 --> 02:31:44.428]  This is all important.
[02:31:44.448 --> 02:31:49.010]  The callers all bring up different angles to this criminal enterprise that is the New World Order.
[02:31:50.451 --> 02:31:53.212]  Andrew, in Maryland, go ahead and finish up.
[02:31:53.252 --> 02:31:55.513]  You were saying you're a broad investigator.
[02:31:55.773 --> 02:31:57.294]  You're just now learning about the New World Order.
[02:31:57.334 --> 02:31:57.714]  Go ahead.
[02:31:58.855 --> 02:32:02.737]  Yes, because what I've learned in my work is that it's really not that hard.
[02:32:02.757 --> 02:32:06.338]  Like you said, once you scratch the surface, it all comes leaking out.
[02:32:06.759 --> 02:32:08.119]  And in a lot of commercial frauds,
[02:32:10.706 --> 02:32:14.769]  You know, the guy earlier had mentioned how the criminals can't make any new laws.
[02:32:14.789 --> 02:32:18.971]  Well, that might be true, but they know what our systems are, and they operate with them, and in fact, they exploit them.
[02:32:19.792 --> 02:32:30.038]  Much like a shoplifter, when he learns how a store's systems work, he'll exploit the weaknesses in that system to be walking out of there with free TVs, everybody thinking it was a return or a merchandise exchange.
[02:32:31.239 --> 02:32:35.562]  And I think the same kind of activity is happening a lot of ways with our nation's wealth.
[02:32:36.970 --> 02:32:41.132]  Our rights, our opportunities, and in many cases, even our people themselves.
[02:32:42.673 --> 02:33:01.424]  People are using the weaknesses in our systems where our founders wanted everything to be done in an open-handed and above-board manner, and they've exploited our level of trust in ourselves and in our heritage to walk away with what we made for ourselves and for our posterity, but they've got it and they've taken it somewhere else.
[02:33:05.494 --> 02:33:06.835]  Who's leading the fight here?
[02:33:06.895 --> 02:33:11.058]  How do we unscramble ourselves and get out of these people's clutches?
[02:33:11.318 --> 02:33:12.719]  Okay, well here's one example.
[02:33:13.199 --> 02:33:14.360]  There is over 1.2 trillion dollars.
[02:33:22.268 --> 02:33:22.908]  We're good to go.
[02:33:23.108 --> 02:33:23.688]  We're good to go.
[02:33:42.959 --> 02:33:44.380]  That was in the Oregonian.
[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:45.440]  That's it.
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:46.801]  Maybe there were a few others I missed.
[02:33:46.821 --> 02:33:51.083]  But the point is, a trillion bucks missing, $200 billion missing.
[02:33:51.343 --> 02:33:52.423]  A million here and a million there.
[02:33:52.463 --> 02:33:53.644]  It's pretty soon you've got real money.
[02:33:53.764 --> 02:33:54.564]  Well, yeah.
[02:33:54.724 --> 02:33:55.905]  And that's what George Sr.
[02:33:55.945 --> 02:33:56.125]  said.
[02:33:56.905 --> 02:34:01.207]  But looking at this, there's been no investigation.
[02:34:01.307 --> 02:34:02.128]  Nothing's happened.
[02:34:02.648 --> 02:34:11.532]  And so we all heard about hundreds of millions of dollars being stolen by mid-level officers who'd go buy 20-color TVs with a credit card.
[02:34:12.645 --> 02:34:13.266]  We're good to go.
[02:34:31.232 --> 02:34:35.575]  To the APD and to Wells Fargo, and it's in the paper today.
[02:34:35.595 --> 02:34:39.837]  Which is another weird mixing of the police and our banking system.
[02:34:39.857 --> 02:34:40.438]  What's that about?
[02:34:40.658 --> 02:34:42.399]  Those are supposed to be separate estates.
[02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:48.503]  It is, but on top of it, they're giving them an award for accepting the matricula.
[02:34:49.703 --> 02:34:51.344]  Which is a federal crime.
[02:34:51.364 --> 02:34:52.405]  Well, it's not our document.
[02:34:52.425 --> 02:34:55.726]  We don't even have the capacity to recognize it.
[02:34:55.746 --> 02:34:56.746]  They're illegal aliens.
[02:34:56.766 --> 02:35:02.849]  They built a huge day labor site in a neighborhood in Austin, and there's thousands of illegals every week there.
[02:35:02.869 --> 02:35:07.331]  And the police have been told, look, if a citizen gets pulled over without a license, you get ticketed or arrested.
[02:35:07.671 --> 02:35:08.731]  I talk to cops all the time.
[02:35:08.751 --> 02:35:10.672]  They've been ordered, let illegals go.
[02:35:10.932 --> 02:35:12.953]  They've got more rights than citizens.
[02:35:12.973 --> 02:35:13.673]  What do you say to that?
[02:35:13.693 --> 02:35:15.954]  I think that's a little lunatic.
[02:35:16.295 --> 02:35:17.135]  And at the same time...
[02:35:18.531 --> 02:35:20.732]  I don't want to deny a person their human rights.
[02:35:21.233 --> 02:35:23.674]  I want to treat people like we're all on the same team.
[02:35:24.154 --> 02:35:29.497]  But like you say, we have to have some rules somewhere as to how we're going to do things.
[02:35:30.077 --> 02:35:31.538]  If somebody wants to get in here, hey.
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:37.786]  Let's set him up on the right track, get him in here clean, make sure he's somebody we want here.
[02:35:37.826 --> 02:35:39.809]  But again, you ask how to fix this.
[02:35:39.869 --> 02:35:42.992]  The government gives them extra tuition, all this welfare.
[02:35:43.092 --> 02:35:46.256]  It is a magnet to get these third world populations here.
[02:35:46.276 --> 02:35:47.438]  Then you ask why.
[02:35:47.458 --> 02:35:48.899]  Why are they doing that?
[02:35:48.999 --> 02:35:50.101]  Drive down the wages.
[02:35:51.262 --> 02:35:55.724]  Causing economic hardship gives the government actually more control, more people go on welfare.
[02:35:56.024 --> 02:35:57.545]  That bankrupts the government more.
[02:35:57.825 --> 02:36:07.191]  The IMF and World Bank then own more of our country and all these illegals then start voting and have no history of freedom and bring us into tyranny.
[02:36:07.791 --> 02:36:15.156]  But the, I mean, that's another thing that's kind of hard to understand sometimes because organizations like the IMF and the World Bank
[02:36:15.991 --> 02:36:21.097]  Their record as being paper tigers in utterly hollow institutions is well known and established.
[02:36:22.418 --> 02:36:23.860]  You don't have to search very far.
[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:26.162]  Yeah, they're just fronts for private institutions.
[02:36:26.703 --> 02:36:28.045]  And they're not even very good at it.
[02:36:28.085 --> 02:36:29.186]  That's part of my point.
[02:36:29.727 --> 02:36:33.490]  You know, and their track record of failure is stupendous.
[02:36:33.810 --> 02:36:39.874]  But see, you're a good person, so you think of things... You know, people say, oh, education's failed, the drug war's failed.
[02:36:39.914 --> 02:36:40.415]  No, it hasn't.
[02:36:40.595 --> 02:36:41.415]  People, they're dumb.
[02:36:42.156 --> 02:36:45.338]  They don't know what the Fourth Amendment is or who the vice president is.
[02:36:45.378 --> 02:36:47.359]  They don't know where Iraq is.
[02:36:47.419 --> 02:36:48.480]  That's how they want us.
[02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:54.705]  I have the manuals from before the turn of the last century where the feds said we've got to dumb people down to public education.
[02:36:54.725 --> 02:36:54.845]  So...
[02:36:55.465 --> 02:36:56.726]  Public education has worked.
[02:36:56.786 --> 02:36:57.506]  It's dumb people down.
[02:36:57.546 --> 02:36:58.106]  The drug war.
[02:36:58.126 --> 02:37:02.508]  There's double the cocaine, triple the heroin, more people in prison, more police.
[02:37:02.768 --> 02:37:03.868]  The drug war has worked.
[02:37:04.328 --> 02:37:05.529]  It's funded the police state.
[02:37:05.829 --> 02:37:09.090]  So you say the IMF and World Bank have failed destroying all these countries.
[02:37:09.470 --> 02:37:10.890]  That's what they're designed to do.
[02:37:11.171 --> 02:37:11.531]  Okay.
[02:37:12.051 --> 02:37:12.351]  Okay.
[02:37:12.833 --> 02:37:14.814]  That's just such an upside-down mission, though.
[02:37:15.434 --> 02:37:17.495]  It's difficult to grasp what the purpose was.
[02:37:17.515 --> 02:37:19.455]  Yeah, but we had Greg Palast from the BBC on.
[02:37:19.776 --> 02:37:26.038]  Joseph Sticklitz, the head economist, go to the interview section of InfoWars and click on it and read the interviews with Palast.
[02:37:26.538 --> 02:37:33.941]  They got the documents where they said, we want to destroy economies, cause riots, and the deals they have say that they will then repossess the whole country.
[02:37:34.241 --> 02:37:37.442]  But I mean, I think what scares people about that...
[02:37:38.963 --> 02:37:43.388]  You know, that has echoes of Masonic Illuminati conspiracy overtones.
[02:37:43.408 --> 02:37:45.590]  Are we heading down that path?
[02:37:45.710 --> 02:37:48.473]  We're already there, and this is the chief economist of the World Bank.
[02:37:48.674 --> 02:37:50.576]  Quit to release this information.
[02:37:50.616 --> 02:37:51.176]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:51.196 --> 02:37:51.817]  Good to hear from you.
[02:37:52.361 --> 02:37:52.861]  Great call.
[02:37:52.881 --> 02:37:54.702]  Let's talk to Mike in Florida.
[02:37:55.082 --> 02:37:55.782]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:37:55.822 --> 02:37:56.222]  Go ahead.
[02:37:56.582 --> 02:37:57.023]  Hey, Alex.
[02:37:57.043 --> 02:37:57.443]  How's it going?
[02:37:57.663 --> 02:37:58.063]  Pretty good.
[02:37:58.603 --> 02:38:00.784]  Yeah, I wrote you an email a few days ago.
[02:38:00.804 --> 02:38:05.165]  I was the educator down in Florida who has been screening the films to his students.
[02:38:05.605 --> 02:38:06.065]  Oh, yes.
[02:38:06.125 --> 02:38:08.026]  Yeah, I just heard you kind of mention it.
[02:38:08.186 --> 02:38:09.687]  I got a couple emails from different people.
[02:38:09.727 --> 02:38:10.527]  Yeah, but you were one of them.
[02:38:10.727 --> 02:38:15.889]  Yeah, and what I wanted to ask you is I just ordered three more of your films.
[02:38:15.929 --> 02:38:18.950]  I have Police State 3 and 9-11, which are great films.
[02:38:19.630 --> 02:38:19.710]  And...
[02:38:20.826 --> 02:38:24.728]  And I'm getting Bohemian Grove, Matrix of Evil, and Masters of Terror.
[02:38:25.288 --> 02:38:32.010]  And I wanted... Some of these students are pretty just kind of blinded by commercial media.
[02:38:33.291 --> 02:38:35.332]  They echo the official line quite a bit.
[02:38:35.772 --> 02:38:41.194]  And I wanted your opinion on which film could possibly get the most impact.
[02:38:41.694 --> 02:38:43.895]  I want to kind of shock them back into reality.
[02:38:45.336 --> 02:38:48.457]  I think the takeover's pretty good because it shows the police...
[02:38:49.176 --> 02:38:49.296]  Okay.
[02:38:49.316 --> 02:38:49.496]  Okay.
[02:39:15.660 --> 02:39:20.404]  There's a local media house here in town, too, and I was wondering your policy exactly on screening.
[02:39:21.045 --> 02:39:26.790]  I know they're a not-for-profit organization, and they're really popular here in town.
[02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:28.251]  Yeah, go ahead and show the videos.
[02:39:28.351 --> 02:39:31.534]  And I can go ahead and maybe set up a regular film screening with them.
[02:39:31.554 --> 02:39:31.854]  Yeah, do it.
[02:39:32.215 --> 02:39:32.715]  Okay, cool.
[02:39:33.916 --> 02:39:40.162]  Another thing is I'm also writing a paper up here, coming up here pretty soon at the end of the semester, about...
[02:39:40.749 --> 02:39:47.433]  About two years ago, it came out that Karl Rove, the White House Chief of Staff, publicly met with the heads of...
[02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:01.271]  We're good to go.
[02:40:14.706 --> 02:40:20.490]  About the CIA, 24, Threat Matrix, and just watch those shows.
[02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:23.232]  Every episode's torture, taking people's rights.
[02:40:23.252 --> 02:40:24.493]  You can show the correlation.
[02:40:24.833 --> 02:40:27.635]  Rove says do this, then it starts happening.
[02:40:28.475 --> 02:40:38.262]  Also, you have government propaganda placement, the tens of millions of dollars, where they pay to have messages put in TV shows, just like Taco Bell pays to have a message put in to the script.
[02:40:38.722 --> 02:40:44.066]  There's an article today about the embedded reporters are now admitting that they were told a lie, that they were under the Pentagon's control.
[02:41:05.695 --> 02:41:06.975]  There's just so much there.
[02:41:07.736 --> 02:41:20.484]  You've got Lionel Shetland on Bush's media board, second command to Rove, who produces a made-for-TV movie on, what was it, Cinemax or Showtime, where Bush is this big hero.
[02:41:20.544 --> 02:41:21.484]  I mean, it's just the problem.
[02:41:21.925 --> 02:41:22.965]  Saving Private Lynch.
[02:41:23.385 --> 02:41:29.009]  It's admitted that Jerry Bruckheimer consulted them on how to shoot the video there and what to say.
[02:41:29.749 --> 02:41:30.830]  That's BBC.
[02:41:31.290 --> 02:41:32.351]  I could go on and on.
[02:41:32.631 --> 02:41:34.713]  Yeah, what I thought was that was kind of shocking.
[02:41:34.733 --> 02:41:41.498]  I was watching Malcolm in the Middle one night, and, you know, they framed the parents as being just terrible, horrible parents.
[02:41:41.518 --> 02:41:45.000]  You know, just kind of your failures.
[02:41:45.341 --> 02:41:49.524]  That's Fox's specialty, a weak male, the family breaking down.
[02:41:49.564 --> 02:41:51.165]  That's Fox's specialty.
[02:41:51.485 --> 02:41:59.451]  Yeah, and what was really funny, it was a clip show, and at one point the husband turns to the wife and he's like, you know, why don't they forcibly sterilize us?
[02:41:59.471 --> 02:42:00.512]  We're terrible parents.
[02:42:01.115 --> 02:42:09.258]  And I heard that, and I was just like, whoa, this would be a really good idea for something in a paper, because most people don't... They look at Malcolm in the Middle, and they don't think propaganda.
[02:42:09.278 --> 02:42:13.359]  Listeners send me videos and stuff, and I pop them in and watch them.
[02:42:13.379 --> 02:42:16.580]  They had a Malcolm in the Middle where he's running a micro-pirate, and he's crazy.
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:19.041]  Yeah, I saw that one.
[02:42:19.121 --> 02:42:20.961]  I'm including that in my paper as well.
[02:42:21.301 --> 02:42:23.442]  So how many of your students are waking up?
[02:42:24.622 --> 02:42:25.163]  I'm getting ready.
[02:42:25.183 --> 02:42:29.644]  That's why I asked you about the films, is because I'm getting ready to do a double screening, both my classes...
[02:42:30.117 --> 02:42:33.139]  Are going to be watching whichever film I choose.
[02:42:33.619 --> 02:42:41.684]  The students I've shown in the past, like I said, I had all but one woke up, and they were thanking me.
[02:42:41.744 --> 02:42:47.347]  One teacher in California, a professor, said 90%, and I think he was the one that said only one didn't wake up.
[02:42:47.587 --> 02:42:57.033]  Yeah, and he's ROTC, just pretty much already used to taking orders and just couldn't necessarily see it.
[02:42:57.509 --> 02:42:58.992]  But you know, later he will.
[02:42:59.272 --> 02:43:00.174]  Yeah, and that's exactly it.
[02:43:00.294 --> 02:43:03.520]  That's what I hope is, even if the students sit through it now.
[02:43:04.065 --> 02:43:04.945]  It'll be a seed.
[02:43:05.145 --> 02:43:07.866]  Well, I hope you realize the power of what you're doing, Mike.
[02:43:08.006 --> 02:43:14.568]  I mean, we don't have any power to change the world unless you become the leader that you've now obviously been for years.
[02:43:15.288 --> 02:43:16.949]  And, again, do your own research.
[02:43:16.989 --> 02:43:18.809]  Don't believe the stuff I come out with.
[02:43:18.869 --> 02:43:19.389]  Check it out.
[02:43:20.029 --> 02:43:21.230]  Make your own documentaries.
[02:43:21.690 --> 02:43:23.330]  Write a book about the subject.
[02:43:23.350 --> 02:43:24.391]  We'll have you on as a guest.
[02:43:24.731 --> 02:43:32.573]  It's about empowering people, moving forward, affecting change positively, and exposing this futile neo-fascist state.
[02:43:32.893 --> 02:43:33.293]  Exactly.
[02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:37.661]  Well, Alex, you keep up the great work, and hopefully maybe I'll call in some other time.
[02:43:37.681 --> 02:43:38.582]  Hey, thank you, Mike.
[02:43:38.602 --> 02:43:39.102]  You keep it up.
[02:43:39.122 --> 02:43:39.762]  Good to hear from you.
[02:43:40.062 --> 02:43:41.562]  Justin in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:43:41.602 --> 02:43:43.823]  Go ahead.
[02:43:44.123 --> 02:43:45.744]  First-time caller, long-time listener.
[02:43:45.764 --> 02:43:46.044]  Welcome.
[02:43:46.064 --> 02:43:54.126]  I've been listening to you for a little over a year now, and I want to thank you for taking my blindfolds off, and now I've just got to keep the handcuffs off everybody.
[02:43:55.047 --> 02:43:58.848]  But I want to tell you an experience I had on Tuesday when I went to the polls.
[02:43:59.901 --> 02:44:05.686]  After I got done voting, I went to give my ballot back to the volunteer ladies who were manning the little desk there.
[02:44:05.706 --> 02:44:10.550]  And I said, so tell me about the electronic voting machines in Ohio.
[02:44:10.931 --> 02:44:12.172]  Are we going to get them in here?
[02:44:12.572 --> 02:44:16.676]  And she says, well, we may not see them in certain areas.
[02:44:16.696 --> 02:44:18.898]  They may be here and may not be in other places.
[02:44:18.978 --> 02:44:19.959]  We may not get them at all.
[02:44:19.999 --> 02:44:24.783]  And I said, well, personally, I hope we don't see them at all because they're a threat to the voting process.
[02:44:24.843 --> 02:44:24.923]  And
[02:44:25.763 --> 02:44:27.003]  She says, oh, really, what did you read?
[02:44:27.023 --> 02:44:30.524]  I said, oh, I've been reading blackboxboating.com on the Internet.
[02:44:31.304 --> 02:44:38.806]  It's been exposing this for quite a while now, the discrepancies that these machines have in the backdoor software engineering.
[02:44:38.926 --> 02:44:40.106]  Well, that's putting it lightly.
[02:44:40.606 --> 02:44:40.846]  Yeah.
[02:44:40.966 --> 02:44:43.427]  Her own engineer at Diebold went public about it.
[02:44:44.087 --> 02:44:48.788]  Yeah, and she basically just gave me this kind of funny look and said,
[02:44:50.069 --> 02:44:52.771]  Oh, well, you can't believe everything you read on the Internet, you know?
[02:44:52.791 --> 02:44:53.611]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:44:53.751 --> 02:44:56.193]  And the League of Women Voters doesn't want there to be a paper trail.
[02:44:56.233 --> 02:44:57.393]  That sounds real good.
[02:44:57.753 --> 02:44:58.734]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:44:58.894 --> 02:45:04.317]  And so I just said, well, you know, you ought to check it out, blackboxvoting.com, and I left.
[02:45:04.417 --> 02:45:16.203]  And I had a little time before I had to go back to work, so I went home and printed out some of the press kit from their website, took it back there, and was going to pass out a couple copies to the ladies there.
[02:45:16.786 --> 02:45:17.627]  And I gave her one.
[02:45:17.707 --> 02:45:20.509]  She says, well, no, I'm not interested in reading that.
[02:45:20.529 --> 02:45:21.570]  I don't want to read that.
[02:45:22.251 --> 02:45:26.915]  I said, well, okay, well, that's fine, and I'll just give it to the other volunteers here.
[02:45:26.935 --> 02:45:29.618]  And she says, no, that's not appropriate here.
[02:45:29.638 --> 02:45:31.499]  You can't pass out information.
[02:45:31.519 --> 02:45:42.329]  Well, there are actually state laws that you can't have electioneering at the poll places, so you've got to stand, I think it's 100 feet, depending on the state, from the poll doing that.
[02:45:42.918 --> 02:45:45.501]  Well, I didn't know, but I... I'm not saying you're bad.
[02:45:45.561 --> 02:45:46.883]  No, it's good what you were doing.
[02:45:47.543 --> 02:45:48.525]  I'm just telling you why.
[02:45:48.685 --> 02:45:50.687]  But notice, oh, I don't want to read that.
[02:45:50.907 --> 02:45:51.748]  I don't want to know.
[02:45:51.768 --> 02:46:03.282]  I knew there were laws against that, but I figured that the laws only were... You couldn't pass out things that had to do with the candidates and the ballot, anything that was on the ballot or anything like that.
[02:46:04.008 --> 02:46:05.968]  But, you know, I wasn't even giving this to the voters.
[02:46:06.048 --> 02:46:07.229]  I was just giving it to the volunteers.
[02:46:07.249 --> 02:46:07.989]  No, no, I understand.
[02:46:08.009 --> 02:46:09.629]  I'm just telling you why they were fearful.
[02:46:09.929 --> 02:46:10.129]  Right.
[02:46:10.189 --> 02:46:11.089]  Oh, they were fearful.
[02:46:11.129 --> 02:46:12.650]  That's what I wanted to get into.
[02:46:12.670 --> 02:46:16.711]  You know, she immediately said, well, that's not appropriate here.
[02:46:16.751 --> 02:46:21.872]  And I said, well, you know, let me just, you know, let me just, you know, I'm not giving them out to the voters here.
[02:46:21.932 --> 02:46:23.652]  You guys just take them and take a look at them.
[02:46:23.732 --> 02:46:32.754]  I began to set them down on the table there to the other volunteers, and she immediately snatched them up and threw them back at me and threatened me and told me I had to leave.
[02:46:34.471 --> 02:46:35.373]  And I just couldn't believe it.
[02:46:35.393 --> 02:46:35.974]  I was shocked.
[02:46:36.034 --> 02:46:37.316]  Well, I'll tell you what you do then.
[02:46:37.376 --> 02:46:40.180]  You come back with 100 copies and put it on all their windshields.
[02:46:40.861 --> 02:46:41.122]  Yeah.
[02:46:41.803 --> 02:46:42.664]  Yeah.
[02:46:42.704 --> 02:46:47.031]  Well, I am going to go to the Voting Council, and I want to... I mean, I do...
[02:46:47.788 --> 02:46:51.132]  Even though I may have been sort of in the wrong in passing out information.
[02:46:51.152 --> 02:46:52.413]  No, you weren't in the wrong.
[02:46:53.154 --> 02:46:56.138]  There's a spirit of the law and a letter to the law, and you were within the spirit of the law.
[02:46:56.618 --> 02:47:04.527]  I would tell you to go to the city council, go to the county commissioners, go to the county clerk, and start your own organization for whatever town you're in.
[02:47:04.968 --> 02:47:05.708]  What town are you in?
[02:47:05.728 --> 02:47:06.950]  Springfield.
[02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:21.943]  Okay, well, citizens, for the integrity of the ballot and in the name of your town, get ten people and show up with demonstrations and show up with the newspaper and you'll be in the paper and your entire town will learn the truth.
[02:47:22.023 --> 02:47:23.744]  It's about you taking action.
[02:47:24.464 --> 02:47:24.644]  Yep.
[02:47:25.764 --> 02:47:26.784]  Well, thank you.
[02:47:26.924 --> 02:47:27.344]  Thank you very much.
[02:47:27.384 --> 02:47:28.325]  Thank you for the call.
[02:47:28.865 --> 02:47:30.525]  You've already taken the first step, Justin.
[02:47:30.885 --> 02:47:32.025]  Ron in New York, go ahead.
[02:47:32.045 --> 02:47:34.006]  Hi, Alex.
[02:47:34.246 --> 02:47:34.746]  Hello, Ron.
[02:47:35.464 --> 02:47:38.006]  It was a pleasure listening to Jack McLam yesterday.
[02:47:38.226 --> 02:47:41.889]  You brought up two things that I could speak to with personal stories.
[02:47:42.049 --> 02:47:48.214]  One is regarding the preference in education of illegal aliens or the children of illegal aliens.
[02:47:48.895 --> 02:47:54.980]  I had an experience where my younger daughter went to live with her adult sister in North Carolina.
[02:47:55.681 --> 02:48:01.365]  She did so to try and broaden her experiences in life and see another culture, southern culture, of course.
[02:48:02.226 --> 02:48:03.307]  When she went there,
[02:48:04.025 --> 02:48:06.387]  They would not register her for public school.
[02:48:07.267 --> 02:48:13.212]  She was considered a nonresident, even though she was seeking to domicile in that state with her older sister.
[02:48:14.273 --> 02:48:31.646]  Concurrently, and at the same time, and I spoke to bureaucrats within the state educational system in Carolina, they indicated that the children of illegal immigrants were entitled to public education without there being any type of sanction or charge whatsoever for it,
[02:48:32.341 --> 02:48:35.884]  And in fact, that was codified in their state laws.
[02:48:36.424 --> 02:48:45.510]  Now, certainly most people think of a state like Carolina as, you know, many people, at least here in the north where I live, as a pro-American state, truly a red, white, and blue place.
[02:48:46.191 --> 02:48:46.751]  Not so.
[02:48:47.292 --> 02:48:57.459]  At the time, I even called the office of Jesse Helms, who was the senator at that point in Carolina and got one of his staffers, who vehemently defended that type of law.
[02:48:58.174 --> 02:49:07.600]  ...definitely defended that type of law, which denied an American child... And Jesse Helms, before leaving office, led the charge for the first by Congress with Mexico.
[02:49:07.620 --> 02:49:10.202]  Look, it's the same for apartments.
[02:49:10.742 --> 02:49:12.083]  It's the same for bank accounts.
[02:49:12.463 --> 02:49:14.945]  The government wants more illegals here.
[02:49:15.685 --> 02:49:17.426]  They have caused the problem.
[02:49:17.606 --> 02:49:17.987]  Go ahead.
[02:49:20.188 --> 02:49:20.748]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:49:20.768 --> 02:49:21.669]  ...to separate us now.
[02:49:22.609 --> 02:49:24.330]  Look, I'm going to give you a minute on the other side.
[02:49:24.370 --> 02:49:26.812]  I'm going to take one final call after that and try to hit one or two stories.
[02:49:27.372 --> 02:49:27.712]  Stay there.
[02:49:27.732 --> 02:49:28.433]  We'll be right back.
[02:49:28.473 --> 02:49:29.813]  InfoWars.com.
[02:49:32.635 --> 02:49:36.958]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:37.158 --> 02:49:41.580]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:46.123]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:49:46.163 --> 02:49:47.484]  The New World Order.
[02:49:49.285 --> 02:49:53.508]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:53.568 --> 02:50:00.494]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:50:00.634 --> 02:50:02.655]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:50:03.016 --> 02:50:13.324]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:50:13.644 --> 02:50:16.166]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then mind you,
[02:50:16.226 --> 02:50:16.446]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:50:16.486 --> 02:50:17.547]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:50:32.015 --> 02:50:38.280]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:44.565]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:50:44.845 --> 02:50:53.291]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:53.532 --> 02:51:00.557]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:51:00.857 --> 02:51:05.678]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:51:05.898 --> 02:51:11.300]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:51:11.640 --> 02:51:14.720]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:22.962]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:51:23.062 --> 02:51:23.502]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:35.222]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name brand medications.
[02:51:35.363 --> 02:51:38.365]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[02:51:56.201 --> 02:51:56.601]  We're good to go.
[02:52:26.601 --> 02:52:35.105]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:52:35.645 --> 02:52:38.566]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:40.207 --> 02:52:42.868]  All right, real quick, Ron, we'll talk to Marion Michigan.
[02:52:43.408 --> 02:52:50.270]  Finish up your point about how if you're a citizen, you can't get in public school, but if you're an illegal, there's an absolute red carpet.
[02:52:50.551 --> 02:52:51.831]  Right, and that was one issue.
[02:52:51.851 --> 02:52:54.112]  The second issue, which Jack had addressed yesterday...
[02:52:54.884 --> 02:52:59.465]  Was regarding lineups at what I would call publicity events.
[02:53:00.225 --> 02:53:11.149]  I was acquainted with an officer in my time who was a hero officer, truly a hero officer, who in 1994 was asked to stand in the background when Clinton and then Attorney General Janet Reno wanted to promote the assault weapons ban.
[02:53:11.749 --> 02:53:12.389]  He was asked.
[02:53:12.469 --> 02:53:14.229]  He disagreed with gun control.
[02:53:14.710 --> 02:53:16.390]  He was eliminated from that lineup.
[02:53:17.673 --> 02:53:23.238]  They no longer were interested in having him show up and stand behind the president and the attorney general while they promoted the assault weapons ban.
[02:53:23.739 --> 02:53:33.068]  And another fact that Jack touched on about you have young people going into policing, that is a problem because when you have people who come from a generation, someone born in the late 70s or early 1980s,
[02:53:34.589 --> 02:53:38.291]  We've essentially come from a time where there is no moral grounding.
[02:53:38.351 --> 02:53:39.871]  They didn't learn any morality.
[02:53:39.911 --> 02:53:41.612]  They have no moral self-discipline.
[02:53:41.972 --> 02:53:46.033]  And then you inject them in large numbers into policing and give them a badge in power.
[02:53:46.434 --> 02:53:52.616]  You essentially have a nearly soulless person running loose with legal authority and a gun.
[02:53:53.177 --> 02:53:55.478]  And this is what's causing a lot of problems in policing.
[02:53:55.518 --> 02:53:57.398]  Of course, I think that was all done by design.
[02:53:57.418 --> 02:54:02.039]  And then the feds come in, and the feds come in and federalize your city to, oh, we're going to save you.
[02:54:02.079 --> 02:54:02.619]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:02.879 --> 02:54:03.139]  Okay.
[02:54:03.480 --> 02:54:04.860]  Marion, Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:05.840]  Go ahead, last caller.
[02:54:06.380 --> 02:54:06.720]  Hello?
[02:54:07.300 --> 02:54:07.701]  Welcome.
[02:54:08.361 --> 02:54:13.182]  Oh, yes, I have a little story that's in a book here about the Upper Peninsula between the iron and the pine.
[02:54:14.562 --> 02:54:17.283]  Between the iron and the pine by Louis C. Ryman.
[02:54:17.648 --> 02:54:18.068]  Okay.
[02:54:18.249 --> 02:54:20.470]  It's about homesteading and land grabbers.
[02:54:20.611 --> 02:54:20.991]  Okay.
[02:54:21.291 --> 02:54:26.556]  In the year 1881, this little Swedish man made a claim and he homesteaded it.
[02:54:26.616 --> 02:54:30.819]  And then one day, and there were explorers looking for, found an outcropping of iron ore.
[02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:36.984]  And he came when the man wasn't home and he ordered his wife off the land, stating he had a claim on it.
[02:54:37.805 --> 02:54:39.466]  And the woman didn't understand too much English.
[02:54:39.486 --> 02:54:40.107]  She was Swede.
[02:54:40.851 --> 02:54:49.173]  But when Mr. Kranz came back home, he made three trips to the land office in Lansing to protect his rights, and each time the land agent assured him that his claim was valid.
[02:54:49.193 --> 02:54:53.635]  And on the third visit, the agent asked him, how far is your house from the property line?
[02:54:53.835 --> 02:54:55.575]  About 500 yards, he replied.
[02:54:55.595 --> 02:55:01.757]  Then here, take this shotgun with you, and when the boardman comes again, give him five minutes to get off your property.
[02:55:01.777 --> 02:55:04.958]  If he isn't off by that time, use the shotgun on him.
[02:55:04.978 --> 02:55:08.279]  The next time Mr. Kranz saw the boardman
[02:55:09.690 --> 02:55:12.932]  He said he gave the claim jumper five minutes to get off the property.
[02:55:13.632 --> 02:55:16.093]  And he said, by Yemeni death, they made it in three.
[02:55:16.113 --> 02:55:18.874]  So the shotgun worked.
[02:55:20.155 --> 02:55:20.455]  Hello?
[02:55:20.915 --> 02:55:22.496]  Yes, that's an interesting story.
[02:55:22.916 --> 02:55:25.617]  And then number two, I have three points.
[02:55:25.877 --> 02:55:26.697]  We're almost out of time.
[02:55:26.717 --> 02:55:27.037]  Go ahead.
[02:55:27.057 --> 02:55:29.418]  The Northwoods and Iron Mountain.
[02:55:29.438 --> 02:55:30.579]  Where is that Iron Mountain?
[02:55:31.297 --> 02:55:33.258]  We have an Iron Mountain Michigan up here in the Upper Bay.
[02:55:33.278 --> 02:55:43.140]  We had a listener call in confusing the Northwoods plan with the Iron Mountain plan, and we don't have time to get off into that, but they're separate.
[02:55:43.220 --> 02:55:51.802]  And then on October 26th, Terry Shikabo's video was shown on the McLaughlin Group on PBS.
[02:55:55.458 --> 02:55:56.699]  They showed the video of Terry.
[02:55:56.739 --> 02:55:57.179]  Well, good.
[02:55:57.379 --> 02:55:58.080]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:58.140 --> 02:55:59.261]  I'm sorry we're out of time, Mary.
[02:55:59.721 --> 02:56:01.062]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:01.102 --> 02:56:03.824]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time.
[02:56:05.065 --> 02:56:05.926]  Be sure and join us.
[02:56:06.166 --> 02:56:13.291]  And if you want to support the show, get the word out and have an effect, do like the college teacher in Florida, the professor.

[02:56:22.617 --> 02:56:28.063]  Make copies of them, show them on local access, give them to your local police, wake people up to the big picture.
[02:56:28.523 --> 02:56:32.087]  Most people have the pieces of the puzzle, they just never put it all together.
[02:56:32.107 --> 02:56:34.729]  The toll-free number to order the videos is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:34.749 --> 02:56:34.989]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:57:12.112 --> 02:57:13.113]  Please get the videos.
[02:57:13.153 --> 02:57:14.213]  I'm very impressed with them.
[02:57:14.233 --> 02:57:15.033]  A lot of folks are.
[02:57:15.334 --> 02:57:17.515]  Nobody's going to see them if you don't get them and get them out to people.
[02:57:17.555 --> 02:57:18.055]  It's up to you.
[02:57:18.075 --> 02:57:18.835]  The ball's in your court.
[02:57:19.075 --> 02:57:19.856]  So get in the arena.
[02:57:20.156 --> 02:57:20.876]  Have a great evening.
