[00:00:02.842 --> 00:00:06.084]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:15.211]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.852 --> 00:00:16.932]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:18.774]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.794 --> 00:00:20.235]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:21.856]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:26.359]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.803]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:56.168]  Welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show where we talk about real issues that actually affect you and your family, where we expose the real political paradigm
[00:00:57.054 --> 00:00:57.574]  We're good to go.
[00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:48.541]  This is where people who are violating federal and state law, who are felons, basically, illegal aliens, run around with ID cards issued by their governments, Guatemala, Mexico, Poland, China, and dozens of other countries, and then cities, socialistic cities,
[00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:58.622]  Cities that want to destroy our sovereignty and want to balkanize this country and drive down wages and want third world populations that are easy to control
[00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.834]  The cities then accept these matricula cards.
[00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:04.856]  Of course, we talk about matricula.
[00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:07.417]  That's the government-issued Mexican ID card.
[00:02:07.457 --> 00:02:09.618]  But now many other governments are doing the same thing.
[00:02:09.698 --> 00:02:13.900]  So he's got a bill to try to stop this, and it's good news.
[00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:20.764]  So the Colorado Senate President, John Andrews, will be joining us here in about 28 1⁄2 minutes.
[00:02:23.547 --> 00:02:25.989]  And it's kind of an immigration show today.
[00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:42.079]  We've got Glenn Spencer of American Patrol coming on the show, the preeminent organization telling the truth about the New World Order plan to destroy our sovereignty by getting rid of the borders.
[00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.541]  If you don't have borders, you don't have a country.
[00:02:45.538 --> 00:03:00.708]  So we'll go inside the story and what's behind the headlines and document the latest information as we track the criminal activities of the New World Order for you here on the show on the 27th of June, 2003.
[00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.613]  In the meantime, the news is getting more and more crazy, more and more out of control.
[00:03:07.713 --> 00:03:10.955]  I'm going to try to race through it for you.
[00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.193]  President of the Senate coming up and Glenn Spencer.
[00:03:18.953 --> 00:03:20.574]  A U.S.
[00:03:20.614 --> 00:03:22.455]  Senator, the oldest U.S.
[00:03:22.495 --> 00:03:25.197]  Senator, the longest serving U.S.
[00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:30.040]  Senator, who just left office last year, died this morning.
[00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:31.582]  Former U.S.
[00:03:31.622 --> 00:03:34.063]  Senator Strom Thurmond dies.
[00:03:34.904 --> 00:03:37.666]  Strom Thurmond, the longest serving Senator in U.S.
[00:03:37.686 --> 00:03:38.966]  history, died Thursday.
[00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:39.827]  He was 100.
[00:03:42.028 --> 00:03:45.611]  So he died in the, I guess, early morning hours yesterday.
[00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:49.556]  Again, Thurman died at 9.45 p.m.
[00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:57.339]  local time in a hospital in his hometown of Edgar Field, said his son, Strom Thurman Jr.
[00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:04.942]  He served as a senator from South Carolina for 48 years as both a Democrat and later as a Republican.
[00:04:06.543 --> 00:04:15.006]  Strom Thurman was attacked viciously and endlessly because he wasn't a Democrat and he wasn't a Klan member, so he was called a racist.
[00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:16.447]  If you're a Klan member...
[00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:22.197]  If you hate black people, if you try to exterminate them, you're called a liberal.
[00:04:23.338 --> 00:04:26.798]  You're called a right-wing extremist if you care about black people.
[00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:29.479]  And so he was attacked.
[00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.360]  Again, George Bush is called a conservative.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.960]  He is the most liberal creature I have ever seen.
[00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:40.742]  Gun-grabbing, open borders, supercomputers, blocking Dan Burton's committee, getting rid of the Bill of Rights.
[00:04:40.862 --> 00:04:42.142]  He's called a conservative.
[00:04:43.803 --> 00:04:44.943]  But in reality, he's a liberal.
[00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:49.872]  Again, I'm just showing you how all these terms are scrambled and the double standards.
[00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:53.815]  And, of course, I'm speaking of Senator Robert Byrd from West Virginia.
[00:04:54.716 --> 00:04:56.378]  Look, I'm not going to get off into this too long.
[00:04:56.418 --> 00:04:57.919]  I'll give you a little bit more details of that.
[00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.901]  The really serious news is coming up.
[00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:02.023]  And believe me, you don't want to miss it.
[00:05:02.063 --> 00:05:03.825]  I don't have time to tell you what it concerns.
[00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:05.806]  But you'll find out when we get back.
[00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:06.987]  It's very important.
[00:05:07.128 --> 00:05:08.449]  Infowars.com.
[00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:12.367]  As a doctor, you're able to cure and heal your patients.
[00:05:12.627 --> 00:05:15.228]  Unfortunately, there's more than that to a successful medical practice.
[00:05:15.508 --> 00:05:20.349]  Confirming appointments, rescheduling missed visits, and sending reminders is inconvenient and time-consuming.
[00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:22.710]  A team of receptionists is a costly solution.
[00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.231]  GTI Technologies has an efficient and manageable answer.
[00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:30.593]  Let GTI's appointment verification system be your communications link to your patients.

[00:06:09.817 --> 00:06:14.178]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:14.338 --> 00:06:18.759]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:23.300]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.660]  The New World Order.
[00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:27.219]  You will lose your liberty
[00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:44.738]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:09.829]  Hello, folks.
[00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:10.830]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.956]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:17.216 --> 00:07:22.341]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:31.950]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:38.793]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:08:03.364 --> 00:08:04.485]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:10.942 --> 00:08:16.584]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:38.110]  I again thank you for joining me on this
[00:08:39.086 --> 00:08:45.024]  Live Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show, and of course, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:46.881]  Former U.S.
[00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:49.122]  Senator Strom Thurmond dies.
[00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:52.803]  Strom Thurmond, the longest-serving senator in U.S.
[00:08:52.843 --> 00:08:55.364]  history, died Thursday night.
[00:08:55.424 --> 00:08:55.725]  He was 100.
[00:08:55.765 --> 00:08:59.566]  Thurmond died at 9.45 p.m.
[00:08:59.626 --> 00:09:06.268]  local time in a hospital in his hometown of Edgar Field, said his son, Strom Thurmond Jr.
[00:09:06.789 --> 00:09:12.991]  He served as a senator from South Carolina for 48 years as both a Democrat and later as a Republican.
[00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:13.991]  We're good to go.
[00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:14.472]  I think?
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:58.255]  And at the retirement dinner that I just so happened to watch on C-SPAN before the firestorm began over the Senate Majority Leader's comments, Trent Lott's comments, the cheerleader from Louisiana's comments about how Strom Thurmond would have made a great president.
[00:10:00.296 --> 00:10:01.057]  Now, look...
[00:10:02.412 --> 00:10:10.258]  People can attack Strom Thurmond on whatever issues they want, but his segregationist views, my friends, were in 1957.
[00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:18.085]  Now, back at that time, Senator Byrd was running around with a white hood on his head.
[00:10:19.924 --> 00:10:20.584]  We're good to go.
[00:10:20.624 --> 00:10:21.004]  We're good to go.
[00:10:50.598 --> 00:10:56.784]  It really is nothing but a balkanizing, shattering effect of the society.
[00:10:56.824 --> 00:10:58.605]  That's what multiculturalism really is.
[00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:04.791]  It's just immunizing, destroying any heritage that any group has.
[00:11:05.883 --> 00:11:24.057]  And it's just as damaging to focus on it saying it's good as it is to endlessly focus on it and say it's all bad because we all get obsessed with it and it actually just continues this whole mindless discussion that's going on.
[00:11:24.878 --> 00:11:25.919]  I'll give you an example.
[00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:29.021]  Race is red herring for neocons.
[00:11:29.728 --> 00:11:42.792]  They don't want to talk about how Bush is going to sign the assault weapons ban and add to it a ban on all semi-automatic shotguns and taxes on ammo and shutting down gun shows and registering all gun owners.
[00:11:42.992 --> 00:11:43.992]  They don't want to mention that.
[00:11:44.032 --> 00:11:44.753]  It's official.
[00:11:45.053 --> 00:11:49.334]  The NRA admitted it a few months ago in their legislative alert section of their website.
[00:11:50.555 --> 00:12:03.506]  A lot of you couldn't believe it when I read the bill on air, but finally you could when the NRA put out an alert and said, yeah, it'll ban shotguns, all semi-automatic shotguns, shutdown gun shows, National Ballistics Database, on and on and on.
[00:12:04.847 --> 00:12:06.808]  So the neocons don't want to talk about that.
[00:12:06.848 --> 00:12:07.849]  They're not going to talk about it.
[00:12:07.869 --> 00:12:14.054]  They won't talk about how Bush didn't want to arm any of the pilots, and Barbara Boxer wanted to arm all of them.
[00:12:14.354 --> 00:12:15.195]  Who's the liberal?
[00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.879]  They don't want to talk about Pardon Gate or Missile Gate or China Gate or...
[00:12:20.996 --> 00:12:24.297]  Patriot Act, gay, they don't want to talk about any of this stuff.
[00:12:25.217 --> 00:12:43.680]  So they focus, they hyperventilate about what Barbara Streisand's doing, or what Al Gore said, or what Hillary Clinton's doing, and they endlessly promote everything Hillary Clinton sells, her stupid book that I wouldn't use as birdcage liner.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.020]  I wouldn't read it if you paid me to.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.001]  I've read some of the excerpts, though, online.
[00:12:48.021 --> 00:12:49.401]  I mean, you talk about lies.
[00:12:51.309 --> 00:12:52.249]  It goes on and on.
[00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:59.472]  And then the liberals will also attack the conservatives in the same little backroom deal promoting their books, like this Ann Coulter.
[00:13:01.032 --> 00:13:02.933]  So they don't want to talk about real issues.
[00:13:02.953 --> 00:13:07.675]  They'll just focus all day on what Jesse Jackson said or what some other liberal did.
[00:13:07.795 --> 00:13:08.735]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:18.438]  Because when it comes to substance, when it comes to action, not rhetoric, but substance, you know, the neocons boss, Stalin, said that...
[00:13:21.371 --> 00:13:23.433]  Well, words are one thing, actions another.
[00:13:23.493 --> 00:13:33.160]  So I look at actions, and the actions are the destruction of America, big government on steroids, the annihilation of what that flag represents.
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:40.546]  But the general public buys into the surface debate, the surface statements of the neocons.
[00:13:40.626 --> 00:13:42.868]  And it's all about how done the liberals are.
[00:13:43.368 --> 00:14:06.556]  But then you find Hillary Clinton together with Bush on not wanting to arm the pilots, together with Bush on invading Iraq, together with Bush on giving supercomputers to Communist China, together with Bush on blocking Dan Burton's committee, together with Bush on the assault weapons ban, together with Bush on private land grabs, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together.
[00:14:06.696 --> 00:14:13.758]  On all the key issues of putting in the cameras and putting in the highway checkpoints and standardizing the surveillance systems.
[00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:16.639]  It's all there.
[00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:17.959]  It's the same actions.
[00:14:18.239 --> 00:14:27.622]  So this whole debate that will now start again over Strom Thurmond, Trent Lott, there'll be no discussion of Byrd riding around on his horse with his Klan hood on.
[00:14:28.983 --> 00:14:29.843]  That's okay.
[00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:32.544]  You know, the liberals love Margaret Sanger.
[00:14:32.584 --> 00:14:33.184]  I mean, the woman...
[00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:36.113]  Got awards from Hitler, gave awards to Hitler.
[00:14:36.153 --> 00:14:39.336]  If you just say you're a liberal, you can run around with a Nazi armband on.
[00:14:40.257 --> 00:14:42.339]  Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.123]  So these people are all in the same grouping together.
[00:14:46.704 --> 00:14:50.067]  It's just, will the establishment decide to attack you?
[00:14:51.048 --> 00:14:53.230]  And Bush had already reprimanded Trent Lott.
[00:14:53.837 --> 00:14:58.000]  I have a Fox News story where Bush told him stop bringing that up for a vote.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.061]  That's not your prerogative.
[00:15:12.101 --> 00:15:13.723]  You follow the White House's orders.
[00:15:14.323 --> 00:15:19.708]  So that's the only reason Bush turned his back on Trent Lott, his little cheerleader buddy.
[00:15:19.728 --> 00:15:22.270]  They were both cheerleaders, male cheerleaders.
[00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:24.172]  That's bad enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:24.212 --> 00:15:26.915]  Don't trust any male cheerleaders.
[00:15:27.996 --> 00:15:33.721]  Simpering, effeminate, New World Order, skull and bones, twits.
[00:15:35.445 --> 00:15:36.346]  All right, continuing.
[00:15:36.406 --> 00:15:41.249]  Certainly don't trust anybody from Kennebuckport, Maine, who affects a fake Texas accent.
[00:15:41.349 --> 00:15:50.156]  It would be like if I went up there to Blue Blood Country and affected the Atlantic accent, you know, the wannabe British accent they have.
[00:15:51.197 --> 00:15:55.380]  Saw an old reel of Prescott Bush speaking in his British accent.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.922]  Oh, yeah, this is excellent.
[00:15:59.923 --> 00:16:00.984]  On the floor of the Senate.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.422]  I've seen George W. Schiff back into his real accent before.
[00:16:05.482 --> 00:16:16.507]  He'll kind of falter and, well, I'll tell you, I mean, let me get back into my Texas accent here for you, boy.
[00:16:16.547 --> 00:16:18.128]  I'm switching back into my real accent.
[00:16:18.688 --> 00:16:20.609]  Oh, let me tell you.
[00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:22.550]  You like fakeness?
[00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.770]  You like being lied to?
[00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.492]  You like being told one plus one equals three?
[00:16:27.032 --> 00:16:29.033]  Well, this isn't the show for you.
[00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:30.934]  You want to turn your shotguns in
[00:16:31.821 --> 00:16:33.202]  You want more regulation?
[00:16:33.222 --> 00:16:34.463]  Then knock yourselves out.
[00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:39.247]  You want gun control and tyranny and slavery and no freedom?
[00:16:39.688 --> 00:16:44.271]  Then Bush and Gore and all the rest of them and John Kerry, Mr. Skull and Bones are for you.
[00:16:45.953 --> 00:16:53.299]  By the way, we do have the President of the Colorado Senate, President John Andrews, scheduled to join us.
[00:16:53.599 --> 00:17:00.685]  He's calling in to talk about trying to stop all the illegals in the cities accepting fake ID cards, basically, the matricula.
[00:17:01.579 --> 00:17:02.319]  So former U.S.
[00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:07.660]  Senator Strom Thurmond dies, and there'll be another big fresh round of debates.
[00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:16.102]  Bush threatens to pacify Liberia, now saying the invasion may begin of another country.
[00:17:16.763 --> 00:17:26.885]  An American military operation to restore order in Liberia looked likely last night as President George W. Bush called for peace in the war-torn West Africa Republic.
[00:17:58.251 --> 00:18:11.578]  Mr. Bush called for all sides in Liberia's bloody civil war to return to the negotiating table to end a series of clashes that have cost millions of lives, including 300 in the capital, Morovia, this week.
[00:18:13.779 --> 00:18:18.702]  Okay, so, of course, this country's full of diamonds.
[00:18:18.742 --> 00:18:19.202]  The U.N.
[00:18:19.242 --> 00:18:20.303]  has been wanting to take it over.
[00:18:20.323 --> 00:18:21.624]  De Beers has been kicked out.
[00:18:21.644 --> 00:18:23.425]  It's been breaking their diamond monopoly.
[00:18:24.905 --> 00:18:25.946]  They've admitted this, by the way.
[00:18:25.966 --> 00:18:27.647]  It's about the diamonds, the gold, the oil.
[00:18:28.499 --> 00:18:34.161]  And so there'll be more troops getting shot there, and they'll claim Al-Qaeda runs the government or something.
[00:18:34.601 --> 00:18:40.043]  You know, every time somebody fights back, they're run by Al-Qaeda, while Al-Qaeda's everywhere.
[00:18:40.143 --> 00:18:41.983]  It's wonderful.
[00:18:42.724 --> 00:18:56.708]  So more war footage for you, your new national pastime, sitting there as our troops huff depleted uranium and nerve gas and aren't given treatment, but you've got a plastic desecrated American flagged away, everything's okay.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.642]  You don't care about the troops, but hey, so what?
[00:18:59.742 --> 00:19:02.625]  You're a mindless idiot, so at least you have that.
[00:19:03.065 --> 00:19:03.846]  Turn your guns in.
[00:19:03.886 --> 00:19:04.827]  You're very conservative.
[00:19:05.527 --> 00:19:06.428]  Arrested U.S.
[00:19:06.468 --> 00:19:07.689]  troops abducted.
[00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:13.595]  Now, more horrible news is six British soldiers were killed on Monday.
[00:19:13.615 --> 00:19:14.496]  There's two U.S.
[00:19:14.536 --> 00:19:18.179]  troops every day this week, so that's up to, I don't know, six or eight.
[00:19:19.594 --> 00:19:20.475]  Arrest as U.S.
[00:19:20.515 --> 00:19:21.575]  troops abducted.
[00:19:21.595 --> 00:19:21.635]  U.S.
[00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:32.061]  forces have arrested three people as they conduct intensive searches for two American soldiers believed to have been abducted north of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
[00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:37.724]  The two servicemen vanished with their vehicle, weapons, and gear on Wednesday night.
[00:19:39.548 --> 00:19:43.529]  Near the town of Balda, there was blood at the scene.
[00:19:43.569 --> 00:19:51.112]  It confirmed the abduction would mark another style of attack on American and British forces occupying the country since BBC's Richard Galpin in Baghdad.
[00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:58.915]  By the way, they say that again, well, we're going to break and we'll be right back and I'll get into more of these tragedies that are unfolding.
[00:19:59.753 --> 00:20:01.416]  And they've got a national draft lined up.
[00:20:01.696 --> 00:20:04.200]  They say we're going to occupy 62 countries.
[00:20:04.901 --> 00:20:06.003]  That's an endless war.
[00:20:06.644 --> 00:20:08.326]  So they've got that lined up for you and your family.
[00:20:08.346 --> 00:20:08.947]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:08.967 --> 00:20:09.308]  Stay with us.
[00:20:12.256 --> 00:20:12.777]  It's here.
[00:20:13.057 --> 00:20:13.778]  It's powerful.
[00:20:14.078 --> 00:20:22.666]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[00:20:22.947 --> 00:20:24.808]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:27.151]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:31.575]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[00:20:31.935 --> 00:20:37.616]  The InnerCore reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.

[00:24:19.564 --> 00:24:35.653]  I've been studying the Iraq situation, and there really wasn't much resistance in the first few weeks after the takeover by the globalists using our troops that they see as disposable.
[00:24:36.733 --> 00:24:41.376]  Disposable heroes is really what the government sees them as.
[00:24:43.724 --> 00:24:57.394]  And after gun confiscation and door-to-door arrests and little kids being put in re-education camps, I mean, there's video and photos of this, the news had mentioned, people being tortured after some rapes by our glorious forces.
[00:24:58.428 --> 00:25:00.431]  And yes, they do that everywhere.
[00:25:00.531 --> 00:25:03.695]  Japan, Korea, Latin America, right here in the U.S.
[00:25:03.935 --> 00:25:05.137]  This is what armies do.
[00:25:05.197 --> 00:25:07.840]  There are some bad people in the military.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.581]  That does happen.
[00:25:08.621 --> 00:25:10.303]  They occasionally do something wrong.
[00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:14.689]  The Iraqis are sick of it, and even people in the South have been on their side.
[00:25:16.046 --> 00:25:26.435]  Are now getting quite angry, but they claim the boogeyman of Goldstein, I mean Saddam, you know, this boogeyman character of 1984, you know, it's all his fault.
[00:25:26.515 --> 00:25:28.456]  He's the one organizing it and running it.
[00:25:28.476 --> 00:25:30.638]  It's been quite a liberation, hasn't it?
[00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:33.160]  Cholera spread all over the country.
[00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:44.129]  The Associated Press reports that when little kids come up with body parts half blown off or fingers missing and beg for medical attention, they're just denied it.
[00:25:45.356 --> 00:25:48.177]  And our troops are getting very angry and upset about it.
[00:25:48.237 --> 00:25:49.278]  They want to give treatment.
[00:25:49.858 --> 00:25:50.778]  But they've got orders.
[00:25:51.038 --> 00:25:52.199]  And the Iraqis are paid.
[00:25:52.219 --> 00:25:54.280]  They're not allowed to have jobs unless it's through the U.S.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.680]  government.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.362]  And they're given $20 a month by Halliburton, who's got a $7-plus million contract.
[00:26:00.403 --> 00:26:02.403]  But they get $20 a month.
[00:26:02.944 --> 00:26:04.324]  It's under slave wages.
[00:26:05.445 --> 00:26:08.466]  It's a nation of 20-plus million slaves.
[00:26:08.746 --> 00:26:10.587]  And they're quite angry.
[00:26:11.347 --> 00:26:13.028]  And our troops are angry about it, too.
[00:26:13.914 --> 00:26:20.617]  Because they don't want to be part of an oppressive force, and now the morale that was quite high is plummeting.
[00:26:22.258 --> 00:26:35.585]  But hey, armchair quarterbacks here at home can affix plastic flags, festoon their cars with plastic desecrated American flags, and who cares if the troops are dying and getting sick now from DU?
[00:26:36.005 --> 00:26:37.146]  By the way, that's now admitted.
[00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:39.611]  But, so what?
[00:26:39.691 --> 00:26:42.574]  You know, supporting the troops means letting them huff D-U.
[00:26:42.814 --> 00:26:45.918]  Okay, well, then if that means supporting them, I don't support them.
[00:26:46.018 --> 00:26:47.380]  I don't support killing our troops.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.381]  I'm sorry.
[00:26:48.401 --> 00:26:51.965]  I know being mindless idiot means you support the troops.
[00:26:52.005 --> 00:26:52.445]  I'm sorry.
[00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:53.367]  I just can't do it then.
[00:26:54.988 --> 00:26:58.933]  And so now troops are being killed and abducted and blown up, and it's terrible.
[00:27:00.538 --> 00:27:03.761]  But here on the home front, they're setting a police state.
[00:27:04.782 --> 00:27:16.052]  But Congressman Tom Tancredo of Colorado, who we've had on the show many times, says, 9-1-1 repeat would be fault of Bush, Congress, GOP, lawmaker charges.
[00:27:16.993 --> 00:27:19.054]  If another terrorist attack is conducted on U.S.
[00:27:19.155 --> 00:27:25.120]  soil by illegal aliens, the fault will lie with Congress and the President, one lawmaker asserted Thursday.
[00:27:26.121 --> 00:27:27.342]  Well, they continue to say this.
[00:27:28.399 --> 00:27:28.619]  Thank you.
[00:27:55.743 --> 00:27:56.744]  They went ballistic.
[00:27:56.784 --> 00:28:05.111]  Well, they announced in Roll Call Magazine that he is being targeted by President Bush, just like Senator Bob Smith was targeted.
[00:28:05.872 --> 00:28:08.034]  Ron Paul has been targeted by the Republicans.
[00:28:08.534 --> 00:28:14.299]  If you're actually pro-gun, pro-border, pro-America, anti-abortion, you are targeted.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.543]  Tancredo said he has made the same statement to the White House officials.
[00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:21.485]  Their response, they told me never to darken the door except for the White House again.
[00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:23.267]  Tancredo revealed they went ballistic.
[00:28:24.136 --> 00:28:25.978]  They asked, how dare you say a thing like that?
[00:28:26.058 --> 00:28:33.625]  I said, you tell me who people should blame, the Elks Club, who's responsible, Tancredo recalled, asking White House officials.
[00:28:35.726 --> 00:28:45.355]  And we'll talk more about this with the head of the Colorado Senate, who is joining us coming up in the next segment.
[00:28:46.773 --> 00:28:49.915]  So that's your new America, by the way.
[00:28:50.615 --> 00:28:54.397]  And they're not just having secret arrest and secret execution in this country.
[00:28:54.537 --> 00:28:57.479]  England, Australia are passing similar laws.
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.381]  Unlimited power of arrest, ASIO says.
[00:29:02.042 --> 00:29:08.866]  They can now secretly arrest members of the press and make them answer questions or any of the citizenry in these new laws.
[00:29:08.906 --> 00:29:11.267]  The press is complaining that they're not being excluded.
[00:29:12.052 --> 00:29:13.653]  And the family need not be told.
[00:29:13.874 --> 00:29:20.138]  If the judge feels you're not answering questions truthfully, you can be secretly given five years in prison.
[00:29:21.519 --> 00:29:26.223]  Now that's tame compared to Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[00:29:26.343 --> 00:29:29.225]  Here it's secret arrest, secret execution.
[00:29:29.706 --> 00:29:32.468]  They cremate your body and they've admitted they have crematoriums.
[00:29:33.469 --> 00:29:34.890]  Oh yeah, that's Rocky Mountain News.
[00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:37.612]  And you're never seen again.
[00:29:38.639 --> 00:29:40.801]  So, Australia's tame.
[00:29:41.261 --> 00:29:52.128]  Says a retired judge is secretly in panel, you're arrested secretly, brought before them, and you don't answer all their questions, and they feel you're not being honest, five years in prison and your family's not told.
[00:29:53.108 --> 00:29:55.289]  Says that right here, Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:57.451]  Hey, that sounds like freedom, doesn't it?
[00:29:57.471 --> 00:29:58.151]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.553 --> 00:30:01.453]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.934 --> 00:30:03.575]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.455 --> 00:30:07.137]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.385 --> 00:30:10.906]  Hello, folks.
[00:30:10.986 --> 00:30:13.869]  Alex Jones here, introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:30:14.129 --> 00:30:17.613]  They're new, and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:25.622]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be... Well, Marilyn, that sounds fantastic.
[00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:28.846]  We'll check back with you a little bit later to learn more about this exciting new product.
[00:30:29.006 --> 00:30:29.667]  Okay, thanks.
[00:30:54.028 --> 00:30:55.469]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:55.569 --> 00:30:57.370]  Alex Jones here, live.
[00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:07.934]  And in the next hour, we have Glenn Spencer coming on from American Patrol, tracking how the Mexican government has said the last three presidents in a row, many times on
[00:31:08.735 --> 00:31:09.376]  We're good to go.
[00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:45.158]  And earlier I was reading a report here, 9-1-1 repeat would be fault of Bush, Congress, GOP, lawmaker, charges.
[00:31:46.019 --> 00:32:08.283]  It's a GOP lawmaker, Congressman Tom Tancredo, who we've interviewed many times, who has been targeted by the White House for being pro-national security and sovereignty, despite the fact that 89% of Americans in major polls, including 80-plus percent of Hispanics, want the borders shut and illegals deported.
[00:32:08.684 --> 00:32:09.944]  It is not a racial issue.
[00:32:09.964 --> 00:32:10.904]  They tried to make it one.
[00:32:11.404 --> 00:32:13.386]  Now we have these matricula cards.
[00:32:13.846 --> 00:32:15.848]  Mexico started issuing them a few years ago.
[00:32:16.208 --> 00:32:17.749]  Now 800-plus U.S.
[00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:19.911]  cities aren't accepting them.
[00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:22.093]  You can go buy one for $24.
[00:32:22.673 --> 00:32:25.756]  Now Poland, Guatemala is issuing their own cards.
[00:32:26.877 --> 00:32:32.961]  Up in Minnesota, they're announcing that they're not going to comply with the FADS, ongoing AFRI legal aliens.
[00:32:33.962 --> 00:32:34.783]  This is insane.
[00:32:35.808 --> 00:32:36.509]  Totally insane.
[00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:46.056]  And we're honored to have joining us Colorado Senate President John Andrews, and he's in a big story in the Denver Post, in the Associated Press, there's a bunch of articles.
[00:32:46.556 --> 00:32:57.524]  He's proposed a state law, and it is the state's job to tell the cities to knock it off and to stop their racketeering, basically, and that's my word, empowering felons.
[00:32:58.425 --> 00:33:01.087]  And Senator, it's good to have you on the show.
[00:33:01.107 --> 00:33:02.368]  I appreciate you taking the time out.
[00:33:02.927 --> 00:33:03.788]  Hi, Alex.
[00:33:03.868 --> 00:33:04.990]  Glad to be with you today.
[00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:07.033]  It's not just a proposed law.
[00:33:07.213 --> 00:33:08.655]  It is law in Colorado.
[00:33:08.675 --> 00:33:14.243]  We are the first of the 50 states to say no to these bogus ID cards that attempt
[00:33:15.017 --> 00:33:24.642]  To erase the distinction between legal immigrants, and we welcome those folks, but the illegals are hiding behind these matricula cards, and Colorado said no more.
[00:33:25.102 --> 00:33:26.383]  I can see how that sounded.
[00:33:26.943 --> 00:33:30.165]  But you're the guy that brought this law forward, correct?
[00:33:30.725 --> 00:33:31.026]  I am.
[00:33:31.166 --> 00:33:36.168]  I'm working with a state representative who's also a constituent of Congressman Tan Credo.
[00:33:36.188 --> 00:33:41.211]  It was actually Representative Don Lee that started it in the statehouse, and I saw it through the state senate, and
[00:33:41.832 --> 00:33:50.807]  I had the honor to testify about it before a congressional subcommittee last week, and I urge Congress to legislate as Colorado has done.
[00:33:51.445 --> 00:34:06.691]  Now, this is wildly popular with people across the spectrum, unless they're just totally American-hating people that don't want to have any jobs or want the health care systems blown out, which is happening in California.
[00:34:07.331 --> 00:34:09.612]  Governor Davis is being recalled right now.
[00:34:10.132 --> 00:34:11.752]  That process is going nicely.
[00:34:12.773 --> 00:34:18.415]  Why is this bill that you've now gotten passed so important for the rest of the country?
[00:34:19.662 --> 00:34:28.311]  We see three reasons why the matricula card, erasing the distinction of legal and illegal immigrants, is bad, Alex.
[00:34:28.771 --> 00:34:31.654]  First of all, it's a matter of homeland security.
[00:34:32.315 --> 00:34:43.526]  Not to say that very many folks from Mexico who are coming here looking for a better life economically and politically, as you just said, would represent a threat, but
[00:34:44.147 --> 00:34:57.310]  The bigger the pool of illegals into which the bad guys can blend themselves, these Islamic terrorists can blend themselves, the tougher it is for our Homeland Security agencies to track them down.
[00:34:57.871 --> 00:35:10.674]  And the matricula card gives a false sense of security when it's accepted by law enforcement or other public agencies that somebody claiming to be Jose Lopez really is Jose Lopez.
[00:35:11.038 --> 00:35:19.980]  When, in fact, there's no verification that is made when the embassy or the consulate issues that card to some guy that says, hey, I'm Jose.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:32.223]  And we've got instances here in Colorado of the same individual with his picture on three different matricula cards, very official looking from the Mexican consulate in Denver, and three different aliases for the guy.
[00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:34.664]  So, first of all, there's a Homeland Security concern.
[00:35:35.184 --> 00:35:36.524]  Second, as you just said,
[00:35:37.099 --> 00:35:44.705]  There is a fiscal integrity concern because there's a lot of public services that are meant for legal residents of the United States only.
[00:35:45.186 --> 00:35:51.631]  Colorado has struggled with this, as many states have, as we have been having to cut our budgets in socioeconomic times.
[00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:59.397]  We're having to say, if you're not in this country legally, you can't have health and welfare and education and other taxpayer services.
[00:35:59.847 --> 00:36:09.574]  And yet the matricula card also would provide access, and we've had Denver and other Colorado municipalities saying, yeah, sure, give us the matricula card.
[00:36:10.034 --> 00:36:11.535]  We'll let you bleed the taxpayer.
[00:36:11.755 --> 00:36:19.981]  Is Denver, and again, we're talking to Colorado Senate President John Andrews, who got this bill passed in his state, and here's the headline Denver Post, U.S.
[00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:25.205]  ban on matriculas urged by Colorado's Andrews, IDs not verifiable.
[00:36:25.285 --> 00:36:25.445]  Now...
[00:36:26.125 --> 00:36:27.266]  Now it's not just Mexico.
[00:36:27.306 --> 00:36:31.088]  It's Guatemala, Chile, El Salvador, Poland, China.
[00:36:31.468 --> 00:36:34.969]  They're all saying, oh, we'll have our embassies issue these.
[00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:40.592]  The police don't know if they're real or they're fake, even if the countries did due diligence.
[00:36:42.313 --> 00:36:48.619]  We have the Communist Chinese Senate reports, federal reports, say that control over 3,000 front companies.
[00:36:48.899 --> 00:36:51.902]  Now they can bring in their agents, their drug dealers, their triads.
[00:36:52.262 --> 00:36:58.488]  I mean, this is a wonderland for terrorists, organized criminals, welfare cheats.
[00:36:58.588 --> 00:36:59.589]  It's a nightmare.
[00:36:59.609 --> 00:37:08.097]  And what a joke to say that, oh, we're worried about terrorists, give up your liberty, citizens, and then to have the illegals here with all these fake cards.
[00:37:08.177 --> 00:37:13.402]  There's about 20 countries that are doing it or proposing to do it, and Mexico is leading the way.
[00:37:13.442 --> 00:37:22.330]  And the congressional testimony a week ago emphasized there was a Latino congressman, a Democrat from Chicago, who heads the Hispanic caucus at the U.S.
[00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:26.514]  House, and he said the matricula is no problem and nothing new about it.
[00:37:26.534 --> 00:37:27.255]  It's been issued.
[00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:28.030]  I think so.
[00:37:48.143 --> 00:37:50.724]  It's a little abstract, but it's what our America is all about.
[00:37:50.744 --> 00:38:10.630]  It comes down to the rule of law, because these cards are being used by a foreign government on a deliberate strategy to say that it doesn't matter if you try to obey the law to get into this country or you thumb your nose at the law, we're going to give you a shortcut around the law and give you the same status even if you enter illegally.
[00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:14.671]  Well, the last president of Mexico said, I got him on video on C-SPAN,
[00:38:15.351 --> 00:38:29.543]  Well, it's just a matter of time until these people demand that they will vote, even if they're not American citizens.
[00:38:29.563 --> 00:38:31.405]  They want to vote on both sides of the border.
[00:38:33.086 --> 00:38:34.988]  Well, it's incredible, Senator.
[00:38:37.009 --> 00:38:43.495]  And, you know, to me, Alex, it's not about any one country or any one people or ethnic group.
[00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.011]  We're good to go.
[00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:45.893]  We're good to go.
[00:38:57.802 --> 00:39:12.376]  Congressman Steve King of Iowa told of going to see a school principal in suburban Des Moines, a Hispanic guy, an educator, who had signed an ad protesting King's immigration concerns.
[00:39:12.436 --> 00:39:15.178]  And King says to the gentleman, what's your problem?
[00:39:15.699 --> 00:39:18.521]  And this Hispanic American, presumably a U.S.
[00:39:18.561 --> 00:39:23.446]  citizen, an educator, someone in charge of holding the minds of kids, says, look, brother,
[00:39:24.068 --> 00:39:25.168]  He didn't cross the border.
[00:39:25.188 --> 00:39:26.309]  The border crossed us.
[00:39:26.729 --> 00:39:35.352]  We're in the process of getting this corner of the country back, and we want to thank you because we're getting it back, financially improved from the condition in which we lost it in the 1840s.
[00:39:35.412 --> 00:39:37.513]  It's just that blatant.
[00:39:38.694 --> 00:39:45.556]  Well, I mean, let's talk about Mecha, La Raza, and others, which La Raza means the race, and Mecha, their websites.
[00:39:45.817 --> 00:39:51.959]  I mean, literally, it's way past the Klan, who I also find to be unsavory.
[00:39:52.789 --> 00:39:54.196]  And it is a racial movement.
[00:39:54.538 --> 00:39:56.106]  On that end of it is...
[00:39:56.994 --> 00:39:57.975]  We're good to go.
[00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:25.996]  I mean, we've got to talk about this.
[00:40:26.397 --> 00:40:27.197]  I live in Texas.
[00:40:27.237 --> 00:40:31.881]  If you go over the border and you break their rules, they'll beat you up and put you in jail forever.
[00:40:32.701 --> 00:40:34.263]  Even if you don't break the rules, they will.
[00:40:34.283 --> 00:40:38.266]  They'll shoot you if you come across their border illegally, but that's okay.
[00:40:38.906 --> 00:40:43.890]  It's this whole breakdown of society now.
[00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:51.756]  And how can the federal government say, give your liberty up for security while they are trying to then accept all of these fake IDs?
[00:40:52.998 --> 00:40:55.180]  It's absolutely inconsistent.
[00:40:56.181 --> 00:41:08.111]  And the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that testified in favor of the matricula in the hearing in House Judiciary a week ago doesn't make policy arguments.
[00:41:08.171 --> 00:41:10.533]  He essentially puts up a bunch of emotional rhetoric.
[00:41:10.573 --> 00:41:13.856]  He says, who do you think ate up your hotel room today?
[00:41:13.916 --> 00:41:17.419]  Who do you think picked the fruit that you ate on your menu today?
[00:41:18.076 --> 00:41:23.613]  These are part of the 10 million illegals in this country, and what we ought to do is just essentially surrender
[00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:27.177]  Give an amnesty to all of them and move on.
[00:41:27.377 --> 00:41:30.299]  But it's a lot more than 10 million, Senator, and we know this.
[00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:35.702]  400 million people in Latin America, 20 million new births a year.
[00:41:36.022 --> 00:41:38.323]  They're building these big highways down into there.
[00:41:38.903 --> 00:41:43.786]  Folks, do you want hundreds of millions of people here?
[00:41:44.307 --> 00:41:47.268]  Folks, have you been to Mexico City where they live in cardboard boxes?
[00:41:47.388 --> 00:41:50.070]  This will lower our standard of living.
[00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:55.736]  And regardless of what color you are, you've got to be against this, and they've tried to make it a racial issue.
[00:41:55.756 --> 00:42:01.943]  But if we had 20 million illegal Russians here, I'd be just as concerned or more.
[00:42:02.543 --> 00:42:04.225]  Also, we have the disease factor.
[00:42:04.285 --> 00:42:10.232]  We need screening for those that come here legally because of the drug-resistant tuberculosis.
[00:42:12.208 --> 00:42:23.717]  There's just all those reasons, and the denial that I saw when I testified before Congress, and I saw it from Republicans, unfortunately, as well as Democrats.
[00:42:24.157 --> 00:42:36.646]  A Republican congressman from Arizona and one from Utah sat on this judiciary subcommittee that's supposed to be helping control our borders and made the argument for the matricula card and the argument for a massive amnesty.
[00:42:37.247 --> 00:42:38.528]  Frankly, I was shocked that...
[00:42:39.372 --> 00:42:43.574]  Them just trying to define this problem away instead of confront the problem.
[00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:46.736]  Well, I had the new congressman on from Arizona.
[00:42:47.436 --> 00:42:47.796]  Which one?
[00:42:48.377 --> 00:42:48.897]  Oh, man.
[00:42:48.937 --> 00:42:50.398]  See, that's why I said the new congressman.
[00:42:50.418 --> 00:42:51.958]  I had him on, like, in January.
[00:42:51.978 --> 00:42:54.380]  Is it Congressman Blake, by chance?
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.061]  No, it's a Hispanic name.
[00:42:57.161 --> 00:42:57.441]  Okay.
[00:42:58.422 --> 00:42:59.082]  I had him on.
[00:42:59.122 --> 00:43:00.543]  It made big news when he said it.
[00:43:01.183 --> 00:43:02.444]  It'll pop in my head in a second.
[00:43:02.764 --> 00:43:04.204]  It was back in January.
[00:43:04.224 --> 00:43:04.985]  But he said...
[00:43:05.962 --> 00:43:08.265]  That this belongs to Mexico.
[00:43:08.285 --> 00:43:11.029]  I mean, I had a congressman on the air.
[00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:16.596]  That audio file was on prisonplanet.com, and they linked to it at American Patrol and a bunch of other websites.
[00:43:17.217 --> 00:43:23.566]  But I had him on here, and when Glenn Spencer's on in the next hour, I know you would have left us, but I can ask Glenn his name because he remembers the incident.
[00:43:24.179 --> 00:43:25.900]  And he knows all these characters.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:37.043]  I mean, imagine if I went down to Mexico, got elected, of course he wouldn't let me, but I got elected to a seat in their government, and then I said, this belongs to the U.S.
[00:43:37.063 --> 00:43:38.183]  It's just amazing.
[00:43:38.524 --> 00:43:42.685]  Now, you talked about this congressman in Iowa or Ohio?
[00:43:42.865 --> 00:43:43.545]  No, Iowa.
[00:43:43.945 --> 00:43:44.605]  Iowa.
[00:43:44.625 --> 00:43:49.547]  Congressman Steve King, he is a real hero of the wake-up call on illegal immigration.
[00:43:50.043 --> 00:43:54.628]  And you said that he went to this school teacher, and this teacher said, the border crossed us.
[00:43:54.888 --> 00:43:55.369]  Yeah, right.
[00:43:55.449 --> 00:44:02.936]  And the teacher said, we're getting the country back, and thank you for substantially improving it while you occupied it.
[00:44:03.137 --> 00:44:11.345]  It's just the blatant revolutionary attitude ought to wake all of us up.
[00:44:12.026 --> 00:44:12.646]  But, I mean...
[00:44:14.614 --> 00:44:19.599]  Southern North America was run by the Mayans and the Aztecs who enslaved all the tribes.
[00:44:19.939 --> 00:44:21.020]  The Spanish did it.
[00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:22.142]  Santa Ana did it.
[00:44:22.182 --> 00:44:24.704]  I mean, who's taking it back?
[00:44:24.764 --> 00:44:25.705]  I don't understand this.
[00:44:26.486 --> 00:44:30.550]  Oh, there's no historical validity to it, Alex, at all.
[00:44:31.591 --> 00:44:37.877]  But it is inflammatory rhetoric that is very attractive to some people that are looking for a shortcut
[00:44:40.197 --> 00:44:50.982]  But isn't this sedition, isn't it treason to have members of Congress and to have people in the country openly announcing we want to bring down America?
[00:44:51.242 --> 00:44:54.284]  I mean, that sounds like the enemy combatant designation to me.
[00:44:54.524 --> 00:44:56.085]  Well, I don't know of any member of Congress...
[00:44:57.625 --> 00:45:00.746]  Well, when I get Spencer on, he heard the interview with this guy.
[00:45:01.186 --> 00:45:06.368]  No, he said that this is... He brought up the Guadalupe Hidalgo, the treaty.
[00:45:06.768 --> 00:45:10.349]  He said, hey, this is really Mexico.
[00:45:10.369 --> 00:45:11.609]  These people have a right to be here.
[00:45:11.629 --> 00:45:13.149]  It was the same statement you just said.
[00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:15.970]  And I'm sorry I don't have his name.
[00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:17.871]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:23.112]  And while we're talking about members of Congress that are AWOL on the issue...
[00:45:24.901 --> 00:45:27.503]  Lamar Smith, you're in Austin, right?
[00:45:27.563 --> 00:45:27.823]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:27.843 --> 00:45:29.564]  Is Lamar Smith your congressman there?
[00:45:30.785 --> 00:45:33.367]  No, we're unlucky enough to have Lloyd Doggett.
[00:45:33.387 --> 00:45:34.808]  He's just south of me.
[00:45:35.409 --> 00:45:37.190]  Lamar Smith for San Antonio.
[00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:42.934]  Okay, Smith sits on the House Immigration Subcommittee where I testified last week.
[00:45:43.034 --> 00:45:45.636]  His eyes are wide open on this issue.
[00:45:46.037 --> 00:45:47.137]  He asked very, very...
[00:45:49.353 --> 00:46:07.295]  Tough and perceptive questions about the danger posed by the matricula, and he really was very blunt about the conscious strategy of the Fox government to try to create a dual citizenship and erase the border.
[00:46:08.741 --> 00:46:16.247]  But corporate America is behind that, and Bush is in a love fest with Fox, and would have passed that if 9-1-1 wouldn't have taken place.
[00:46:16.287 --> 00:46:22.613]  When 9-1-1 happened, that kind of... Remember the week before 9-1-1, he had Fox at the White House, and they were announcing all this?
[00:46:22.833 --> 00:46:27.096]  Yeah, and the whole thing is coming back onto the front burner now.
[00:46:27.136 --> 00:46:29.178]  There is at least one bill...
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:45.727]  From two Arizona congressmen that creates a massive amnesty disguised as a guest worker program, but it isn't a guest worker program because these folks get a temporary green card and then it becomes permanent after three years and nobody ever has to go home.
[00:46:46.047 --> 00:46:47.788]  That's not a guest worker program.
[00:46:47.988 --> 00:46:48.728]  That's an amnesty.
[00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:53.051]  We're talking to Colorado Senate President John Andrews, and I really appreciate him being on.
[00:46:53.071 --> 00:46:54.871]  I have a few other questions for him.
[00:46:54.891 --> 00:46:56.392]  He can stay with us another five, ten minutes.
[00:46:56.432 --> 00:46:57.733]  But Senator...
[00:47:00.226 --> 00:47:02.187]  Look, I mean, this is such a massive problem.
[00:47:03.047 --> 00:47:05.488]  There's 6.5 billion people on the globe.
[00:47:05.528 --> 00:47:06.748]  They all want to come here.
[00:47:07.028 --> 00:47:08.609]  Is 500 million enough?
[00:47:08.689 --> 00:47:09.549]  Is 2 billion enough?
[00:47:09.889 --> 00:47:12.130]  I mean, how many people are we going to accept here?
[00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.891]  This is getting insane.
[00:47:13.911 --> 00:47:15.671]  20 million new births a year.
[00:47:16.111 --> 00:47:17.432]  We've got to get a hold of this.
[00:47:17.472 --> 00:47:18.212]  This is crazy.
[00:47:18.272 --> 00:47:21.413]  I mean, the Mexicans don't let the Guatemalans take over.
[00:47:21.453 --> 00:47:23.634]  They've got a big fence down there with Guatemala.
[00:47:24.457 --> 00:47:26.198]  Yeah, the hypocrisy is awful.
[00:47:26.719 --> 00:47:30.701]  Their southern border means something that our southern border isn't supposed to mean something.
[00:47:30.921 --> 00:47:33.563]  But if we don't have a border, we don't have a sovereign country.
[00:47:34.384 --> 00:47:34.704]  Amen.
[00:47:35.304 --> 00:47:41.569]  And, you know, I've got a strong libertarian streak in my conservative Republican outlook.
[00:47:41.709 --> 00:47:43.730]  And I'm a free market guy.
[00:47:44.551 --> 00:47:48.874]  And that used to make me more or less of an open borders guy.
[00:47:50.556 --> 00:47:54.597]  And not to say no immigration controls, but to be sort of relaxed about the whole thing.
[00:47:54.637 --> 00:47:59.199]  Sort of the optimistic perspective of the Wall Street Journal editorial page.
[00:47:59.259 --> 00:48:02.340]  But now they're saying this is Africa.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:10.663]  I've had to take another look at all of the aspects of this, the security aspects, the budget aspects of it.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:19.444]  And we've got a tenured professor right here at one of our state colleges in Denver who spends a lot of his time propagandizing.
[00:48:19.504 --> 00:48:23.726]  Tell you what, Senator, we've got a quick three-minute break and then just do five minutes on the other side with us if you can.
[00:48:23.746 --> 00:48:27.168]  We'll be right back with the Colorado Senate President, John Andrews.
[00:48:27.208 --> 00:48:29.950]  We really appreciate him standing firm for America.
[00:48:31.306 --> 00:48:31.746]  That's right.
[00:48:31.766 --> 00:48:34.888]  LifeWise will set a jar of JointWise cream to you absolutely free of charge with no obligation of any kind.

[00:49:30.288 --> 00:49:33.750]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:37.533]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:49:37.613 --> 00:49:41.555]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:49:41.776 --> 00:49:47.940]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:56.265]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:49:56.685 --> 00:50:02.006]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:05.947]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:50:06.307 --> 00:50:08.148]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:50:08.228 --> 00:50:10.409]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:50:10.629 --> 00:50:15.570]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:21.151]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:50:24.552 --> 00:50:28.396]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:50:29.077 --> 00:50:33.421]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:33.601 --> 00:50:38.025]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:38.165 --> 00:50:42.549]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:43.951]  The New World Order.
[00:50:45.712 --> 00:50:49.936]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:49.996 --> 00:50:56.922]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:50:57.062 --> 00:50:59.104]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:50:59.444 --> 00:51:09.853]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:10.074 --> 00:51:11.695]  If you want to understand what the new world order
[00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:14.257]  All right, folks, you cannot talk about a more serious issue
[00:51:39.944 --> 00:51:46.306]  I mean, of the top issues, frankly, the border and sovereignty may even outstrip the Second Amendment.
[00:51:47.066 --> 00:51:52.248]  I mean, they're right up there as kind of a dual binary system.
[00:51:52.288 --> 00:51:54.829]  I mean, it's very, very important.
[00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:58.510]  And the congressman is Grijalva.
[00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:01.511]  In fact, I knew that was the name, but I wasn't sure.
[00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:07.373]  I wanted to go to the congressional website and look at the representative from Cochise County area.
[00:52:07.393 --> 00:52:08.233]  It's Grijalva.
[00:52:08.971 --> 00:52:10.532]  I mean, this guy is a piece of work.
[00:52:11.193 --> 00:52:16.137]  We have him on tape saying basically this is Mexico and I don't have any right to call for sovereignty.
[00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:17.710]  We're good to go.
[00:52:47.148 --> 00:52:48.709]  So the media tries to make it racial.
[00:52:48.769 --> 00:52:52.492]  It's not, as the state senator president was saying.
[00:52:53.913 --> 00:52:59.717]  Continuing, sir, with the problems we face, any other key points you'd like to make, Senator?
[00:53:00.398 --> 00:53:13.267]  Well, let me just encourage listeners to go to coloradosenate.com, our website where one of our lead stories right now is my congressional testimony that I gave on June 19th to a U.S.
[00:53:13.307 --> 00:53:15.329]  House Immigration Subcommittee.
[00:53:15.988 --> 00:53:29.490]  And that has a rundown on Colorado's new bill that says state and local officials will not accept the phony consular ID card whether it's from Mexico, Poland, Peru or any other country.
[00:53:31.843 --> 00:53:47.750]  There is a section where a police officer can take this card as a starting point to figure out who somebody is on a law enforcement stop, but then they've got to keep that in the criminal record along with the fingerprints of that individual so we begin to create a trail.
[00:53:48.231 --> 00:53:49.791]  You know, you think of how the D.C.
[00:53:49.871 --> 00:53:51.992]  snipers were caught last fall, Alex.
[00:53:52.432 --> 00:54:00.196]  That is because we had a seamlessly traceable criminal record across the country, and while there are privacy concerns that you have to balance,
[00:54:00.703 --> 00:54:01.143]  We're good to go.
[00:54:17.915 --> 00:54:22.857]  Senator, I read an AP article out of Ohio where they were running a checkpoint during the federally funded checkpoints
[00:54:47.535 --> 00:54:51.078]  And they kept catching truckloads, vanloads full of illegals, all this stuff.
[00:54:51.418 --> 00:54:53.960]  They would call INS, and INS would say, release them.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:55:01.445]  And the police chief in this town pointed out that he was there arresting citizens for petty stuff, searching their cars, violating the Fourth Amendment.
[00:55:02.026 --> 00:55:03.287]  These were not seatbelt checks.
[00:55:03.307 --> 00:55:04.968]  This was trying to get rid of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:55:05.248 --> 00:55:08.531]  But illegals have like a super citizen status.
[00:55:09.855 --> 00:55:11.896]  So they even have more rights than citizens.
[00:55:11.956 --> 00:55:20.281]  I mean, I can't go out and get five or six fake ID cards and have police accept them, but some illegal from Poland or Mexico can.
[00:55:21.142 --> 00:55:22.703]  It's absolutely backwards.
[00:55:23.063 --> 00:55:30.228]  That's what Colorado House Bill 1224, now law in Colorado, first state in the country, that's what we're trying to stop.
[00:55:30.448 --> 00:55:37.292]  And I do hope people will visit ColoradoSenate.com and learn more about the bill and encourage legislators in their states
[00:55:38.875 --> 00:55:47.839]  And if there's more terror, and it's an illegal, and you know it's going to be an illegal, it's going to be their fault.
[00:55:48.039 --> 00:55:50.900]  You tell them what Congressman Tancredo said.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:58.483]  Do you agree with his statement that those that don't pass these laws are going to be held responsible by the people for helping the terrorists?
[00:55:59.557 --> 00:56:10.542]  All of us that are lawmakers or federal legislative responsibility, there is an unforgivable omission if we don't wake up to this problem.
[00:56:10.782 --> 00:56:11.242]  All right.
[00:56:11.282 --> 00:56:14.563]  To Colorado Senate President John Andrews, hope to have you back up in the future.
[00:56:15.204 --> 00:56:16.224]  And thanks for coming on.
[00:56:16.264 --> 00:56:17.064]  Have a great weekend.
[00:56:17.104 --> 00:56:17.645]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:56:18.165 --> 00:56:19.725]  I'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:56:21.744 --> 00:56:23.705]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:47.669]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:49.390]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.111 --> 00:56:51.212]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.872 --> 00:56:52.672]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.453 --> 00:56:55.374]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.394 --> 00:56:58.696]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.196 --> 00:57:03.259]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:09.610]  Alright folks, it's Friday.
[00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:11.471]  We've got two hours left.
[00:57:11.571 --> 00:57:19.156]  We've got Glenn Spencer, one of my favorite guests, to come on and talk about the destruction of America and our sovereignty.
[00:57:19.696 --> 00:57:28.782]  How illegal aliens get more welfare, more tuition, more rights, are allowed to have fake ID cards that anyone can get basically dozens of.
[00:57:30.623 --> 00:57:32.504]  And how citizens are losing their liberties.
[00:57:32.785 --> 00:57:34.045]  That's coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:57:34.065 --> 00:57:38.608]  When we get back to the next segment, I'll go to Brenton, Connecticut, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:57:39.069 --> 00:57:54.579]  If you'd like to join me on air to talk about the issue that the State Senate President of Colorado was talking about, the national sovereignty issue, as Mexico announces that the United States belongs to Mexico, it is official, and the White House is behind it, involved in it.
[00:57:54.959 --> 00:58:00.263]  The white men, the old bankers are part of it, wanting to break down our sovereignty and destroy our liberties.
[00:58:00.843 --> 00:58:10.107]  And if they can bring another 20 million illegals in who have no history of freedom, that'll make a nice mass for them to push around an order who don't have any understanding of freedom.
[00:58:10.387 --> 00:58:12.308]  And it'll drive down the wages even further.
[00:58:13.428 --> 00:58:14.309]  So that's coming up.
[00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:16.570]  More on that, of course, your calls in the next segment.
[00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:16.630]  800-259-9231.
[00:58:21.099 --> 00:58:24.860]  The feds are announcing they want to track all cattle and have Homeland Security involved in it.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:32.383]  You'll have to track and trace your cattle, your sheep, your goats, and it'll be a new tax for you, federal inspections of your farms and ranches.
[00:58:33.023 --> 00:58:33.923]  Hope you enjoy it.
[00:58:34.624 --> 00:58:41.386]  Ridge announced last year, I have him on tape on C-SPAN, saying this is for tracking and tracing part of Homeland Security.
[00:58:41.426 --> 00:58:45.767]  Now they claim it's to stop mad cow, which is totally ridiculous.
[00:58:46.027 --> 00:58:47.228]  So look out for that.
[00:58:47.288 --> 00:58:48.008]  That's coming up.
[00:58:49.124 --> 00:58:51.347]  Big story, unlimited power of arrest.
[00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:56.296]  Australia's domestic intelligence agency, ASIO, will have aggressive new powers.
[00:58:57.051 --> 00:59:03.133]  From today to detained for an unlimited period, citizens suspected of having information about terrorist offenses.
[00:59:03.734 --> 00:59:15.378]  It says they can secretly arrest you, bring you before a secret judge, a non-sitting judge, and if they feel you haven't told the truth, on the spot, put you secretly in prison for five years.
[00:59:16.039 --> 00:59:17.139]  Now, you think that's bad?
[00:59:17.519 --> 00:59:19.240]  That's much better than here in the U.S.
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:22.081]  They just won't admit what they're doing, even though it's in the bill.
[00:59:23.354 --> 00:59:24.015]  But don't worry.
[00:59:24.135 --> 00:59:26.858]  Paul Wolfel wants to oversee military tribunals.
[00:59:27.619 --> 00:59:29.121]  He will select the secret judges.
[00:59:29.161 --> 00:59:32.725]  He will select who is secretly arrested and who is secretly executed.
[00:59:33.185 --> 00:59:38.271]  Source on this, Associated Press, Robert Burns.
[00:59:38.912 --> 00:59:39.593]  That's coming up.
[00:59:41.011 --> 00:59:41.131]  U.S.
[00:59:41.171 --> 00:59:42.551]  pledges to avoid torture.
[00:59:42.952 --> 00:59:46.372]  They've now admitted that our troops have tortured people to death.
[00:59:46.473 --> 00:59:53.274]  Bush pledges that will stop as they increase the funding for torture training at Fort Benning, Georgia, and admit torture.
[00:59:54.635 --> 00:59:57.896]  Record cuts, higher taxes, the states struggle to survive tough times.
[00:59:58.276 --> 01:00:05.217]  The feds are going to increase the gas tax and other taxes while cutting taxes publicly to make you think they're doing something.
[01:00:05.237 --> 01:00:07.098]  So they raise five taxes and cut one.
[01:00:07.834 --> 01:00:09.294]  Overall, taxation increases.
[01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:10.695]  That's coming up.
[01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:14.155]  Also, smart cars, smart roads can help drivers.
[01:00:15.015 --> 01:00:16.276]  It is official.
[01:00:16.416 --> 01:00:19.676]  The feds say within five years they will remote control your cars.
[01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:23.417]  They say they will remote control your cars for your safety.
[01:00:24.257 --> 01:00:27.298]  So now it's not just going to be satellite tracker boxes taxing you.
[01:00:27.798 --> 01:00:29.038]  That's just to fund all this.
[01:00:29.378 --> 01:00:34.999]  Now they will remote control your cars, large stretches of road that will take full control of your cars.
[01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:40.417]  And allow you to drive at speeds of 80 to 90 miles an hour, but they'll be in control of your car.
[01:00:40.998 --> 01:00:42.501]  Doesn't that sound nice?
[01:00:43.282 --> 01:00:44.264]  Folks, it's happening.
[01:00:44.564 --> 01:00:45.366]  That's coming up.
[01:00:46.056 --> 01:00:47.918]  Fed acts to counter threat of deflation.
[01:00:48.358 --> 01:00:50.419]  Cuts interest rates again a couple days ago.
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:53.582]  They're now approving the deadly anthrax shot for you and your family.
[01:00:53.642 --> 01:00:56.564]  Bush has created the new federal agency BioShield.
[01:00:56.884 --> 01:01:01.128]  Six plus billion a year to create giant infrastructures for forced inoculation.
[01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:06.692]  They already made it the law they can forcibly inoculate you in page 76 of Homeland Security.
[01:01:07.032 --> 01:01:09.114]  They're now saying the smallpox shot is safe.
[01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:12.516]  Protea appeals for UK to join the Euro.
[01:01:12.556 --> 01:01:13.317]  That's coming up.
[01:01:14.191 --> 01:01:19.375]  On the edge of a genetic revolution, they're admitting massive global DNA databases.
[01:01:19.395 --> 01:01:22.678]  The UN is pushing from the blood that's taken from your babies at birth.
[01:01:23.158 --> 01:01:25.540]  The USDA plans livestock tracking system.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.280]  Warned you about that.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.001]  That's coming up.
[01:01:27.581 --> 01:01:29.383]  All this and more after this quick break.
[01:01:29.943 --> 01:01:31.044]  Your calls first.
[01:01:31.484 --> 01:01:34.606]  Toll-free number to join us on this live open line Friday, 800-259-9231.
[01:01:34.626 --> 01:01:36.648]  I'm Alex Jones, desperate to defend America.
[01:01:43.374 --> 01:01:50.762]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:01:51.042 --> 01:01:55.767]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:01:56.008 --> 01:02:01.654]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:02:01.874 --> 01:02:02.595]  We're good to go.
[01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:18.726]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:45.953]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:02:46.193 --> 01:02:47.614]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:02:48.094 --> 01:02:49.536]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:02:49.796 --> 01:02:54.960]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:59.823]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar and no fluoride.
[01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:08.830]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease and clove oil.
[01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:09.931]  Gum disease is
[01:03:10.011 --> 01:03:10.892]  We're good to go.
[01:03:41.423 --> 01:03:42.023]  We're good to go.
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:10.100]  800-419-2335.
[01:04:39.833 --> 01:04:45.614]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:49.035]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:49.095 --> 01:04:52.155]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:07.978 --> 01:05:08.879]  We're back live.
[01:05:08.899 --> 01:05:13.845]  It is Friday, 27th of June, 2003.
[01:05:14.186 --> 01:05:19.973]  And later in this hour, I want to talk about nuke program parts unearthed in Baghdad backyard.
[01:05:20.093 --> 01:05:21.855]  Now, this is from CNN.
[01:05:21.956 --> 01:05:26.902]  And they've already admitted that the so-called mobile bioweapons trucks...
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.482]  I know our media didn't tell you, but the U.S.
[01:05:29.502 --> 01:05:35.046]  government admits it now, have been bought from the British, and they also bought some other trucks from the Russians.
[01:05:35.086 --> 01:05:41.391]  But the two trucks in question were bought from the British in 1985 in the middle of the Iran-Iraq War.
[01:05:41.431 --> 01:05:48.237]  They are for pumping up dirigibles, blimps, for surveillance to direct artillery and trench warfare.
[01:05:48.717 --> 01:05:49.778]  Our government has them.
[01:05:50.439 --> 01:05:51.420]  Everybody has them.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.102]  It's a World War I-type technology.
[01:05:55.093 --> 01:05:59.795]  They have them on the southern border to surveil drug interdiction.
[01:06:01.096 --> 01:06:07.159]  But our government knew this day one, saw the serial numbers, knew what the trucks were, and told you it was mobile bioweapons lamps.
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:13.662]  But there were hundreds of front-page stories, and then the retraction is about a paragraph in the back of the paper.
[01:06:13.702 --> 01:06:15.523]  That's what it was in the Austin, America Statesman.
[01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:19.051]  So now nuke program parts unearthed in Baghdad.
[01:06:19.071 --> 01:06:20.271]  We've been lied to so many times.
[01:06:20.691 --> 01:06:23.512]  They claim that they found them buried under a bush.
[01:06:23.753 --> 01:06:25.213]  Yes, a bush in a backyard.
[01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:34.056]  Well, it turns out that a real system, the way they describe this, covers about 100 football fields.
[01:06:34.116 --> 01:06:35.717]  It's a giant plant.
[01:06:36.657 --> 01:06:38.338]  And we have a photo on prisonplanet.com.
[01:06:39.974 --> 01:06:41.214]  That was the news from two days ago.
[01:06:41.254 --> 01:06:46.476]  You just click on the archive of what these plants really look like, and then they claim they found this in a rose bush.
[01:06:46.496 --> 01:06:51.097]  Well, let me just cover this now, and then I'll go to Brett and Roger and others that are holding.
[01:06:51.577 --> 01:06:54.158]  Nuke program parts unearthed in Baghdad backyard.
[01:06:54.178 --> 01:07:00.519]  The CIA has its hands in the critical parts of key parts of Iraq's nuclear technology.
[01:07:00.839 --> 01:07:05.340]  Parts needed to develop a bomb program that were dug up in the backyard in Baghdad.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.521]  CNN has learned the parts which...
[01:07:08.678 --> 01:07:23.307]  With accompanying plans were unearthed by the Iraqi scientist Mahid Obadi, who said he had hidden them under the rose bush in his garden 12 years ago under orders from Qazi Hussein, one of Saddam Hussein's son-in-laws, Hussein Kamel.
[01:07:24.298 --> 01:07:25.259]  Or Hussein Kamel.
[01:07:25.819 --> 01:07:38.289]  CNN security correspondent David Inzor reports that under United Nations sanctions in place in 1991, the concealment of such materials and failure to disclose their presence would have constituted violations of Security Council regulations.
[01:07:38.709 --> 01:07:39.070]  But U.S.
[01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:42.332]  officials emphasize that it was not evidence that Iraq had a nuclear weapon.
[01:07:43.233 --> 01:07:44.774]  It's like a little canister.
[01:07:45.675 --> 01:07:52.200]  But it was evidence that Iraqis concealed plans to reconstruct their nuclear program as soon as the world was no longer looking.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.321]  The parts and documents...
[01:07:54.252 --> 01:07:55.853]  Well, we show a picture of a gas centrifuge plant.
[01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:21.172]  And the actual parts in it, according to the government websites you've been to, fill entire warehouses.
[01:08:21.252 --> 01:08:27.314]  But they got some parts the size of footballs, little metal canisters, and they're saying this is it.
[01:08:28.314 --> 01:08:40.398]  Now, a few weeks ago, they admitted they were so desperate to find weapons of mass destruction, they were, quote, going to give amnesty and pay, in some cases millions of dollars, to people who would go public and say they were part of a nuclear program.
[01:08:41.571 --> 01:08:42.532]  Now, it gets worse.
[01:08:43.193 --> 01:08:55.244]  They reported in the BBC about two months ago that Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, was to be paid upwards of four and a half million dollars a year.
[01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:59.128]  It was almost three million pounds a year, so over four million U.S.,
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:13.790]  And that he was going to live on a hundred-plus-thousand-acre palace of Prince Charles and was to be given armed bodyguards, helicopter escort, into the shopping centers, into London.
[01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:15.871]  I mean, lavish lifestyle.
[01:09:17.132 --> 01:09:19.635]  If he would inform on Saddam's weapons of mass destruction.
[01:09:20.015 --> 01:09:21.456]  Now, I don't know where that story went.
[01:09:21.737 --> 01:09:23.418]  Where is Tariq Aziz?
[01:09:23.799 --> 01:09:25.640]  We hear no discussions of him now.
[01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:36.070]  They admit they paid off Iraqi Republican Guard leaders before the war in gold bars, euros, and dollars to give up before the war even started.
[01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.831]  That's admitted.
[01:09:36.891 --> 01:09:38.853]  Delta Force flew them out by helicopter.
[01:09:40.105 --> 01:09:44.327]  They would simply walk to an open field, the helicopter would land, they'd climb on and get out of there.
[01:09:44.827 --> 01:09:48.929]  It happened during the war, this is all admitted, but again, in the back of the paper.
[01:09:48.989 --> 01:09:51.370]  The back of the paper once, and you never hear about it again.
[01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:53.411]  So I don't believe anything they say.
[01:09:53.431 --> 01:09:58.393]  They claim that this African country sold them nuke parts, turned out the whole document was fake.
[01:09:58.793 --> 01:10:01.714]  They claimed a bakery in northern Iraq was a bioweapons lab.
[01:10:02.114 --> 01:10:04.015]  BBC went in, it was a bakery.
[01:10:04.597 --> 01:10:08.418]  They claim they had a secret document written a week before Colin Powell gave his speech.
[01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:14.780]  Turned out it was written 12 years before by a graduate student at University of California at Berkeley.
[01:10:16.181 --> 01:10:20.382]  I mean, the lies, they claim to mass graves in that warehouse.
[01:10:20.422 --> 01:10:23.323]  You know, the boxes full of sand and bones.
[01:10:24.893 --> 01:10:26.715]  Oh, look, political dissidents killed.
[01:10:27.175 --> 01:10:32.078]  Turned out it was dead Iraqis, dead Iranians, and the Iranians have an exchange program.
[01:10:32.099 --> 01:10:41.425]  They were exchanging dead found from the hundreds of thousands that died on the Iraqi side, millions that were killed on the Iranian side, over a million, in the Iran-Iraq war.
[01:10:41.525 --> 01:10:44.908]  Just like we exchange bodies with South and North Korea.
[01:10:45.348 --> 01:10:52.954]  Every couple months you hear about more bodies coming back on jets with American flags on them, usually UN flags on them, from North Korea.
[01:10:53.943 --> 01:11:03.467]  So, and I still hear neocon liars, gun grabbers, on the air going, we got mobile weapons labs, we got mass graves, we got blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:05.528]  They bought nuclear parts from Niger.
[01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:07.709]  And they know that's not true.
[01:11:07.749 --> 01:11:08.929]  They're not stupid.
[01:11:08.949 --> 01:11:10.730]  Probably smarter than I am.
[01:11:12.136 --> 01:11:17.179]  Folks, they're still using the same lies after they've been caught.
[01:11:17.219 --> 01:11:17.999]  Okay, let's go to the calls.
[01:11:18.039 --> 01:11:18.460]  I'm sorry.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.941]  Brett in Connecticut, up there in Skull and Bones land.
[01:11:22.302 --> 01:11:22.882]  Welcome, Brett.
[01:11:22.902 --> 01:11:23.582]  You're on the air.
[01:11:24.083 --> 01:11:24.943]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:11:25.043 --> 01:11:25.623]  Fantastic.
[01:11:25.644 --> 01:11:26.404]  How's the show going?
[01:11:26.784 --> 01:11:29.786]  Well, I'm from New York, but I'm just calling you from Connecticut.
[01:11:29.966 --> 01:11:31.247]  And the show is great, Alex.
[01:11:31.327 --> 01:11:32.968]  I'd just like to say one thing.
[01:11:33.948 --> 01:11:40.892]  I believe this might sound a little crazy to you, but I believe that President Kennedy was kind of directed by God when
[01:11:41.812 --> 01:12:01.575]  He protected the world pretty much from destruction during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and I'd just like to say that I feel in a way that you're kind of the same way by trying to bring out what's happening to the people, that you're being directed by God in the same way to try and save the world, essentially.
[01:12:02.111 --> 01:12:03.071]  Well, I don't think that's strange.
[01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:07.033]  And I'd just like to say that to you before I bring up what I was going to talk about.
[01:12:07.053 --> 01:12:09.254]  Well, Brett, let me just make a comment on that, and then I'll let you go on.
[01:12:09.274 --> 01:12:09.994]  Okay.
[01:12:10.715 --> 01:12:11.975]  Look, but I'm not special.
[01:12:12.255 --> 01:12:13.636]  President Kennedy wasn't special.
[01:12:13.676 --> 01:12:16.137]  We're all led by God in our lives.
[01:12:16.177 --> 01:12:18.138]  Yes, because God works through people, yes.
[01:12:19.036 --> 01:12:21.018]  This is a test.
[01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:31.087]  This is the junior varsity, the minor leagues here, before we go on to join the big team.
[01:12:31.507 --> 01:12:31.987]  That's true.
[01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:33.188]  Let me add something.
[01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:44.278]  Kennedy, for all his corruption and his womanizing and all the rest of it, changed his ways at the end, woke up, gave speeches at American University and other areas.
[01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:45.159]  I have copies of them.
[01:12:46.705 --> 01:12:49.887]  I have text from the National Archives, Library of Congress.
[01:12:49.927 --> 01:12:51.568]  I'd love video of this movie if I could find it.
[01:12:51.588 --> 01:12:52.429]  I know it exists.
[01:12:52.949 --> 01:12:56.011]  Where he warned of a great corrupt influence that had taken over our government.
[01:12:56.511 --> 01:12:58.893]  Eisenhower warned of the military-industrial complex.
[01:12:59.673 --> 01:13:01.234]  And Kennedy was a hawk.
[01:13:01.986 --> 01:13:12.690]  He was pro-war, pro-CIA, pro all this stuff, and then suddenly he cut taxes, said I'm abolishing the Federal Reserve, I'm getting us out of Vietnam, I'm going to scatter the CIA to the four winds.
[01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:14.991]  He wouldn't go along with nuclear war.
[01:13:15.131 --> 01:13:17.152]  He said no to the Northwoods plan.
[01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:28.295]  Because Alex, if he had invaded the way the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted him to invade, they had tactical nuclear weapons that were on the ground in Cuba that were going to be used by the local Russian commanders.
[01:13:28.335 --> 01:13:28.475]  Exactly.
[01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:56.432]  And that would have been the end of the world, because once those attack nukes were shot against our fleet, our invasion fleet, that would have been the start of the end of the nuclear exchange.
[01:13:57.133 --> 01:14:02.234]  And you're correct, and again, this is documented, I have people involved in the Bay of Pigs on.
[01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:06.535]  They were afraid that the Cubans themselves were going to overthrow Fidel.
[01:14:07.275 --> 01:14:09.255]  Good, conservative, Christian Cubans.
[01:14:09.976 --> 01:14:10.676]  And this is admitted.
[01:14:11.316 --> 01:14:15.997]  The CIA rattled them out at Bay of Pigs to defeat them, to have them on the beach, tied down,
[01:14:16.872 --> 01:14:19.894]  And they then thought Kennedy would authorize the invasion.
[01:14:19.994 --> 01:14:21.615]  Again, problem, reaction, solution.
[01:14:22.515 --> 01:14:34.141]  In fact, the Joint Chiefs even went to Kennedy, and they got green-lighted all the way up to him, and he said, no, they said, we want to attack our own Marines at Guantanamo with Army dressed up as Cubans and kill Americans to get the war going.
[01:14:34.898 --> 01:14:35.398]  That's amazing.
[01:14:35.618 --> 01:14:36.499]  That's Northwood, sir.
[01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:37.660]  That's a public document.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.440]  I know.
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:39.321]  I've read it.
[01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:40.341]  I've seen it.
[01:14:40.662 --> 01:14:45.244]  Well, for those that don't know, I've got ABC News, Baltimore Sun, on Infowars.com reporting it.
[01:14:45.585 --> 01:14:47.005]  But not just that, my friend.
[01:14:47.286 --> 01:14:47.886]  Not just that.
[01:14:48.606 --> 01:14:51.988]  We have the actual Northwoods document.
[01:14:52.028 --> 01:14:52.329]  Go ahead.
[01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:59.593]  The other thing I wanted to say was, Alex, I've gotten your DVD of 9-1-1, Road to Tyranny, and I'm
[01:15:01.946 --> 01:15:06.369]  I've been giving it to some of my friends and whatnot, but I'm getting a lot of resistance.
[01:15:06.450 --> 01:15:14.496]  Some of the more educated people are more open to what you're talking about than the ones that have, like I say, a head in the sand scenario.
[01:15:15.396 --> 01:15:22.282]  And I get the same thing that other callers are calling into, saying they're trying to say that you're paranoid and all this stuff.
[01:15:22.442 --> 01:15:23.623]  And it's kind of really...
[01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:30.413]  It's very upsetting that these kind of things could be happening in our country and no one cares about it.
[01:15:30.453 --> 01:15:31.273]  Well, let me break that down.
[01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:32.374]  It's really upsetting.
[01:15:33.314 --> 01:15:36.736]  If you've been listening, you've heard some callers say that everyone wakes up.
[01:15:36.836 --> 01:15:42.038]  Most callers say that a lot of folks wake up, and some say that hardly anyone wakes up.
[01:15:42.478 --> 01:15:47.221]  Now, you mentioned that... Well, no, some of them do, but you almost have to...
[01:15:49.013 --> 01:15:52.558]  You know, the less intelligent people, I guess, I don't know what it is.
[01:15:52.578 --> 01:15:54.141]  I wouldn't even say the more educated.
[01:15:54.161 --> 01:15:56.124]  I wouldn't say less intelligent.
[01:15:56.164 --> 01:15:57.806]  I would say, like you're saying, yes.
[01:15:59.327 --> 01:16:01.808]  But I wouldn't say that it's the more educated.
[01:16:02.288 --> 01:16:07.710]  It's those that read more newspapers, study more history, and obviously that's generally going to be more educated.
[01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:09.950]  Let me just finish.
[01:16:10.090 --> 01:16:15.552]  Because when they see the film, they see a bunch of information that they already were aware of.
[01:16:15.592 --> 01:16:16.952]  You see, they know it's true.
[01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:20.594]  Someone who's ignorant just goes, well, I don't like how this guy looks.
[01:16:20.654 --> 01:16:21.614]  I don't know if this is true.
[01:16:23.556 --> 01:16:23.896]  All right.
[01:16:23.916 --> 01:16:25.317]  Well, that's pretty much what I wanted to say.
[01:16:25.397 --> 01:16:26.737]  Thanks, Alex, for talking to me.
[01:16:26.797 --> 01:16:27.477]  I appreciate it.
[01:16:27.697 --> 01:16:32.059]  Hey, God bless you, and thanks for the support, and keep making copies of the films, and keep spreading the word.
[01:16:32.579 --> 01:16:33.519]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:16:33.539 --> 01:16:36.260]  We'll come back and talk to Roger and others, and we'll get into some more news.
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:41.882]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com are the websites, and I know I'm... Well, we'll be right back.
[01:16:44.002 --> 01:16:48.484]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:16:48.824 --> 01:16:52.927]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:53.227 --> 01:16:53.767]  We listened.
[01:16:54.067 --> 01:16:59.070]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.810]  We listened.
[01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:03.252]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.672 --> 01:17:04.212]  We listened.
[01:17:04.672 --> 01:17:07.534]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[01:17:07.654 --> 01:17:08.114]  We're good.
[01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:37.532]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[01:17:37.752 --> 01:17:40.435]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[01:18:41.679 --> 01:18:45.943]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:18:46.383 --> 01:18:50.927]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:18:51.308 --> 01:18:56.172]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:18:56.552 --> 01:18:58.334]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[01:18:58.374 --> 01:18:59.415]  can barely be read.
[01:18:59.695 --> 01:19:00.676]  It has faded that much.
[01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:04.900]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:05.801]  We're good to go.

[01:19:35.826 --> 01:19:36.266]  The number, 800-686-2237.
[01:19:41.118 --> 01:19:42.919]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:19:43.099 --> 01:19:48.740]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:49.920]  Probably never, right?
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.261]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.

[01:20:37.161 --> 01:20:40.002]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:20:47.472 --> 01:20:49.353]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:49.854 --> 01:20:52.676]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:55.838 --> 01:21:02.122]  A lot of times on the weekend, I tune into a local rebroadcast of my show on News Talk 1260.
[01:21:02.562 --> 01:21:09.487]  I actually carry my show seven days a week, live at night, and then on Saturdays and Sundays from 3 to 6.
[01:21:12.131 --> 01:21:26.579]  In the afternoon, I get a chance to hear my show, and great callers call in like Brent, and they try to make their points, and then I start running over them, and it sounds to me sometimes like I'm trying to show off with information.
[01:21:26.639 --> 01:21:27.079]  I'm not.
[01:21:27.679 --> 01:21:34.763]  I have this instinctive need to stop callers when they're making a good point and to add information and sources and documents to it
[01:21:35.416 --> 01:21:39.119]  Because I know people are driving around out there listening and they're going, oh, this is just made up.
[01:21:39.159 --> 01:21:39.880]  It's ridiculous.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.981]  No, it's not made up.
[01:21:41.441 --> 01:21:42.542]  It's historical fact.
[01:21:42.602 --> 01:21:44.644]  You better check out what we're saying.
[01:21:45.445 --> 01:21:47.566]  And, you know, frankly, I've listened to other shows.
[01:21:47.727 --> 01:21:50.949]  Overall, I let callers say more than 90% of talk shows.
[01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:54.953]  I just interrupt people and add my points and then let them go on.
[01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:58.916]  And I just thought about how I was behaving in the last segment.
[01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:00.077]  I appreciate Brent's call.
[01:22:00.117 --> 01:22:03.520]  I was just trying to throw information in there because it's so important.
[01:22:04.697 --> 01:22:06.458]  And it really is an information overload.
[01:22:06.498 --> 01:22:07.418]  I mean, look at these articles.
[01:22:07.538 --> 01:22:09.018]  Unlimited power of arrest.
[01:22:09.879 --> 01:22:21.022]  Australia's domestic intelligence agency, ASIO, will have aggressive new powers from today to detain, for an unlimited period, citizens suspected of having information about terrorist offenses.
[01:22:21.602 --> 01:22:24.223]  It says that a judge is secretly impaneled.
[01:22:24.423 --> 01:22:30.465]  A retired judge, you can be secretly arrested and secretly held for up to five years with no charges.
[01:22:31.904 --> 01:22:34.887]  If the judge believes you're not being forthcoming.
[01:22:35.587 --> 01:22:37.249]  And it says this will go for the press.
[01:22:37.309 --> 01:22:38.550]  And it's not just for terror.
[01:22:39.010 --> 01:22:40.211]  It's for all crime.
[01:22:40.752 --> 01:22:43.534]  You notice they took most of the guns a few years ago in Australia.
[01:22:44.015 --> 01:22:45.136]  Same thing's happening here.
[01:22:45.156 --> 01:22:48.519]  I mean, I could spend an hour on this article.
[01:22:49.359 --> 01:22:50.100]  I got a bunch of them.
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:51.201]  New law on terrorism.
[01:22:51.601 --> 01:22:53.403]  Racist specter of agency abuse.
[01:22:53.643 --> 01:22:54.104]  Abuse.
[01:22:54.124 --> 01:22:56.085]  Another article.
[01:22:56.185 --> 01:22:57.747]  Unlimited power of arrest.
[01:22:59.176 --> 01:23:06.539]  I got articles here about how the feds announced they're going to remote control your cars and control them on the highways now, not just satellite track and tax them, AP.
[01:23:06.559 --> 01:23:10.081]  I mean, folks, this is bonker land crazy.
[01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:16.884]  They're going to make you tag and control your cows and sheep, and they're going to inspect them, the homeland security is.
[01:23:16.904 --> 01:23:18.744]  It has nothing to do with protecting us.
[01:23:18.784 --> 01:23:20.125]  The border's wide open.
[01:23:20.879 --> 01:23:23.541]  It's about taxing and control and feudalism.
[01:23:23.881 --> 01:23:25.002]  Folks, this is horrible.
[01:23:25.082 --> 01:23:30.606]  Government is expanding in a thousand directions, taking everything over, and they call it conservative.
[01:23:31.547 --> 01:23:35.610]  Let's talk to Roger and then Wyatt and Ron and Spencer and others.
[01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:38.171]  Roger, you're on the air from Pennsylvania.
[01:23:38.652 --> 01:23:39.492]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[01:23:39.572 --> 01:23:48.799]  I just had a laugh left over from the last call because the New Testament says, "...forever learning, never understanding."
[01:23:49.981 --> 01:24:01.189]  And, you know, when the commie Chinese tried to take over the Mongolians, they had kind of a problem there because Mongolians weren't exposed to these sophist, flowery political theories.
[01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:03.951]  And so they said, well, let me get this straight.
[01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:07.353]  You're going to take all our produce and give it back to us as we need it?
[01:24:08.874 --> 01:24:11.456]  No, so they weren't educated yet out of their common sense.
[01:24:13.959 --> 01:24:22.422]  Well, I think by educated, people that see The Road to Tyranny, that know history, that know its facts, that have seen the documents themselves, are like, wow, I already knew that.
[01:24:23.022 --> 01:24:25.963]  I think he's talking about ignorant people don't respond.
[01:24:26.303 --> 01:24:30.064]  Yeah, I know, but it takes a certain amount of education to be duped as well.
[01:24:30.304 --> 01:24:31.124]  That was my point.
[01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:32.424]  But anyway.
[01:24:34.989 --> 01:24:38.552]  You didn't quite state this on whether you're talking.
[01:24:38.572 --> 01:24:44.216]  I forget if the head of the INS is still the Clinton hangover, but that's... It doesn't matter.
[01:24:44.276 --> 01:24:45.597]  Bush loves Clinton people.
[01:24:45.997 --> 01:24:59.848]  Well, the point I wanted to help clarify here is whether it's that or the head of the Border Patrol or the head of the State Department, and you've got to dismiss this notion that the State Department has a life of its own.
[01:25:00.888 --> 01:25:01.589]  Well, it will...
[01:25:02.886 --> 01:25:11.233]  It does have its own agenda if left to its own devices, which happens to be the exact same identical... Oh, they always claim that the State Department did something bad.
[01:25:11.313 --> 01:25:12.934]  Oh, it's this other federal agency.
[01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:14.936]  They're the ones destroying our sovereignty.
[01:25:15.196 --> 01:25:16.197]  Thanks for the call, Roger.
[01:25:16.457 --> 01:25:17.057]  Gotta let you go.
[01:25:17.077 --> 01:25:17.838]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:18.218 --> 01:25:19.139]  Wyatt, Maryland.
[01:25:19.179 --> 01:25:19.899]  Wyatt, go ahead.
[01:25:19.939 --> 01:25:20.520]  You're on the air.
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:24.863]  I heard on another station there was a...
[01:25:26.613 --> 01:25:33.680]  Well, they had Mad Cow pop up in Saskatchewan province, and now it showed up, according to the Billings Gazette, in Nebraska.
[01:25:50.336 --> 01:25:50.536]  Right.
[01:25:50.576 --> 01:25:53.438]  Well, that's what they're going to be using, just like they did with the hoof and mouth.
[01:25:53.858 --> 01:26:00.282]  Oh, they said the feds are going to take over all cows and sheep, so they know what you own, so they can come kill it later.
[01:26:00.763 --> 01:26:03.844]  And, of course, it was the British government that was caught releasing foot and mouth.
[01:26:04.185 --> 01:26:05.586]  Source on that, London Telegraph.
[01:26:05.626 --> 01:26:07.547]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:26:07.787 --> 01:26:07.987]  Yeah.
[01:26:08.507 --> 01:26:08.968]  Have you heard?
[01:26:09.408 --> 01:26:14.211]  What's the story with the chemical warfare trucks that were brought into the Desoto National Park?
[01:26:14.231 --> 01:26:15.672]  I haven't heard anything from that anymore.
[01:26:16.232 --> 01:26:19.154]  Remember when they were in a customs lot?
[01:26:19.615 --> 01:26:20.636]  It was hundreds and hundreds of vehicles.
[01:26:20.656 --> 01:26:24.279]  Yeah, why don't you recap the listeners' memory on that?
[01:26:24.299 --> 01:26:24.939]  Stay there, Wyatt.
[01:26:24.959 --> 01:26:25.479]  Don't hang up.
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:26.760]  Come back and let you finish.
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:29.343]  And we've got Glenn Spencer coming on, but we'll go right to your calls, too.
[01:26:29.723 --> 01:26:31.004]  Ron and Spencer and others.
[01:26:31.024 --> 01:26:31.604]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:34.006]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.487 --> 01:26:36.108]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.009 --> 01:26:39.691]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.808 --> 01:26:48.996]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:26:49.697 --> 01:26:53.501]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... 803-4438.
[01:26:53.521 --> 01:26:54.603]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:27:06.513 --> 01:27:12.556]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:27:13.156 --> 01:27:16.117]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:19.098 --> 01:27:23.100]  The federal government is passing laws where citizens have absolutely no rights.
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:32.584]  They're doing it in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, while bringing in masses of illegal aliens and accepting...
[01:27:33.729 --> 01:27:34.670]  We're good to go.
[01:27:56.696 --> 01:28:09.166]  And I've got articles here where you have absolutely no rights, police are being militarized, all this is happening, while illegals get more and more welfare, tuition, health care, everything you can imagine.
[01:28:10.107 --> 01:28:24.259]  In the last hour at Colorado, Senate President John Andrews talked about how another congressman from Iowa has been at town hall meetings and has talked to witnesses and has talked to community leaders who say, this is Mexico,
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.781]  And we're getting rid of America, and that's just the way it is.
[01:28:28.681 --> 01:28:30.601]  So Mexico has been so arrogant.
[01:28:30.641 --> 01:28:40.944]  The Fortune 500 that's funding the breakup of America has been so arrogant that people are starting to wake up across the board that this is part of the New World Order.
[01:28:41.464 --> 01:28:46.685]  As Glenn Spencer says, our sovereignty is being sacrificed on the altar of globalism.
[01:28:47.506 --> 01:28:51.427]  So Glenn Spencer is coming up in a few minutes from AmericanPatrol.com.
[01:28:51.447 --> 01:28:52.527]  Just amazing folks.
[01:28:53.311 --> 01:29:14.006]  We'll talk about their activities and Glenn's expert analysis of the situation, the state of the country right now, and this all-important issue of the borders and sovereignty and the billions, not the millions, the billions of people that are trying to come to this country and the 25 million illegals that are here right now.
[01:29:15.427 --> 01:29:20.531]  But I did want to give a caller who didn't have much time, about a minute or so, to finish up the point he was making.
[01:29:21.167 --> 01:29:29.820]  Before I do that, though, I've got at least once today put a plug in for my new film, Police State Free Total Enslavement.
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.704]  It is two hours and 40 minutes long.
[01:29:33.909 --> 01:29:51.888]  It covers how the border is wide open, why all the government passes Patriot Act 1 and introduces Patriot Act 2, what the executive orders do, what Homeland Security does, how this affects our republic, the FEMA camps, the foreign troops, the deals to bring in Mexican and Canadian troops, mainstream news stories.
[01:29:53.782 --> 01:29:56.563]  Government-sponsored terrorism to destroy our liberties.
[01:29:56.683 --> 01:29:57.564]  It goes on and on.
[01:29:57.644 --> 01:29:58.664]  Police State 3.
[01:29:59.104 --> 01:30:00.125]  Total enslavement.
[01:30:00.165 --> 01:30:02.566]  An amazing new film I've produced.
[01:30:03.026 --> 01:30:05.047]  I also have 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:30:05.487 --> 01:30:06.547]  The Masters of Terror.
[01:30:06.647 --> 01:30:09.948]  Two films covering 9-1-1 and what really happened there.
[01:30:10.089 --> 01:30:12.209]  Such an important thing to be informed on.
[01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:15.010]  I have my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:30:15.491 --> 01:30:16.151]  230 pages.
[01:30:16.271 --> 01:30:20.012]  Also covers September 11th and different facets we didn't cover in the films.
[01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:20.953]  It's...
[01:30:22.486 --> 01:30:23.246]  We're good to go.
[01:30:23.266 --> 01:30:23.847]  I think?
[01:30:47.478 --> 01:30:52.181]  Don't stand idly by and wish years from now that you would have done something.
[01:30:52.262 --> 01:30:54.063]  We can stop the globalists.
[01:30:54.643 --> 01:30:56.064]  We can control our borders.
[01:30:56.525 --> 01:30:58.586]  We can reaffirm the Second Amendment.
[01:30:58.646 --> 01:31:05.151]  We can get out of the Patriot Act and do sensible things to stop terror if you'll take action.
[01:31:05.191 --> 01:31:08.253]  And the films are the best tool we have found to do it.
[01:31:08.971 --> 01:31:16.155]  So go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order the videos or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:16.175 --> 01:31:16.895]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:29.418 --> 01:31:40.764]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:31:42.405 --> 01:31:43.485]  Please take action.
[01:31:43.866 --> 01:31:45.647]  Please order the videos today.
[01:31:46.607 --> 01:31:51.850]  Now, real quick, Wyatt, you were trying to talk about a story where they found these chemical weapon lab trucks.
[01:31:52.685 --> 01:32:00.329]  And the government had let them through, and they were held at some base, and you wanted to comment on that, talking about national security.
[01:32:00.369 --> 01:32:01.189]  Go ahead real quick.
[01:32:01.309 --> 01:32:05.431]  Yeah, there was a story, I think it broke around 94 through 96.
[01:32:05.631 --> 01:32:16.036]  It was in Mississippi, and there was, I think it was in the DeSoto National Park, one portion of it, it's a big park, national park, that there was about,
[01:32:16.676 --> 01:32:31.843]  Two to three hundred chemical warfare trucks that were imported from Eastern Bloc countries and brought over and stored in a customs lot in the middle, not in the middle, but inside this national park.
[01:32:32.003 --> 01:32:33.484]  Yeah, let me comment on that.
[01:32:33.524 --> 01:32:35.725]  I've got to let you go because we've got Glenn Spencer waiting wide.
[01:32:35.765 --> 01:32:36.586]  It's a good question.
[01:32:37.146 --> 01:32:41.028]  We have photos of that on Infowars.com in the photo section.
[01:32:42.088 --> 01:32:45.670]  We have photos of concentration camps marked in Russian
[01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:52.432]  And then I have video, and I'm talking about barbed wire, machine gun nests, guard towers.
[01:32:53.052 --> 01:33:06.716]  And then, if that's not enough for you, in police state to the takeover, I have cooperative nugget 96 and 97 with foreign troops, Czechoslovakian, Russian, and others, admittedly with the top general, the U.S.
[01:33:06.776 --> 01:33:11.857]  general, saying, you are the forces of the New World Order, and this is for domestic action.
[01:33:12.337 --> 01:33:13.638]  So that is going on.
[01:33:13.958 --> 01:33:14.678]  Now it's official.
[01:33:15.353 --> 01:33:16.474]  All right, wanted to get that out of the way.
[01:33:16.534 --> 01:33:17.835]  I appreciate Glenn Spencer holding.
[01:33:17.875 --> 01:33:20.937]  And coming up, we'll get to Ron and Spencer and others that are holding.
[01:33:20.957 --> 01:33:27.340]  But right now, Glenn Spencer of AmericanPatrol.com, the organization American Border Patrol.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:35.566]  And they stand up against the racist Hispanic Ku Klux Klan of Mecha and La Raza.
[01:33:36.446 --> 01:33:38.507]  They have Hispanic members, black members, you name it.
[01:33:38.527 --> 01:33:40.929]  A lot of my friends are members right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:33:41.781 --> 01:33:46.602]  They stand up with 80 plus percent of the American people for controlling our borders and our sovereignty.
[01:33:47.383 --> 01:33:51.064]  Glenn Spencer told us it was a war to take over our sovereignty years ago.
[01:33:51.744 --> 01:33:55.965]  That Washington was aiding and funding this along with President Bush and the Democrats.
[01:33:57.306 --> 01:33:58.766]  He's been totally vindicated.
[01:33:59.486 --> 01:34:03.027]  And now he's moved from California that he says has officially fallen.
[01:34:03.807 --> 01:34:05.068]  Now look at the straits it's in.
[01:34:05.488 --> 01:34:08.269]  He's now moving out to Arizona.
[01:34:09.853 --> 01:34:13.076]  And we had Grijalva on, and of course he said that the U.S.
[01:34:13.116 --> 01:34:14.337]  really does belong to Mexico.
[01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:15.217]  That's a congressman.
[01:34:15.598 --> 01:34:19.381]  Glenn Spencer, good to have you on the show and to give us your analysis of what's going on.
[01:34:21.943 --> 01:34:27.667]  Well, someone once said it's a good thing God designed time, invented time, because everything would happen at once.
[01:34:28.488 --> 01:34:33.652]  But it seems that everything is being compressed in time because there is so much going on at once right now.
[01:34:34.412 --> 01:34:35.653]  We have the border wars.
[01:34:35.693 --> 01:34:36.994]  We have the info wars.
[01:34:37.635 --> 01:34:38.776]  We have the Mexican...
[01:34:39.511 --> 01:34:41.772]  Matricula Consular Card Wars.
[01:34:42.653 --> 01:34:49.516]  We have the war over California, the war over Gray Davis, who will be recalled.
[01:34:50.077 --> 01:34:51.057]  He's going to be fired.
[01:34:51.097 --> 01:34:52.438]  He's the governor of California.
[01:34:53.218 --> 01:35:03.924]  There's just so many things we have to kind of pick and choose, just as I did when I decided that there was nothing that could be done for California, that it would fall of its own weight.
[01:35:04.788 --> 01:35:09.231]  And I moved here to the border to essentially make a last stand.
[01:35:09.812 --> 01:35:11.613]  And we're having a great deal of success.
[01:35:14.114 --> 01:35:15.595]  Glenn, break it down for us.
[01:35:15.756 --> 01:35:17.837]  What is this border issue?
[01:35:18.417 --> 01:35:19.418]  What's behind it?
[01:35:20.158 --> 01:35:22.920]  And are we now seeing people begin to wake up to this?
[01:35:25.542 --> 01:35:29.925]  Nothing can explain it better than a reporter who was here yesterday.
[01:35:29.945 --> 01:35:32.507]  His name was Luke.
[01:35:33.078 --> 01:35:34.399]  I think we're good to go.
[01:35:58.567 --> 01:35:59.627]  He saw what we were doing.
[01:35:59.668 --> 01:36:12.393]  He saw our high technology, our unmanned aerial vehicles, our border sensors, our satellite Internet system, and he said, my gosh, you know, the idea that they would be calling you vigilantes is silly.
[01:36:13.253 --> 01:36:15.194]  But as he really warmed up, he said this.
[01:36:16.174 --> 01:36:18.255]  He said, I want you to understand something.
[01:36:18.635 --> 01:36:25.938]  I'm a reporter, but I will tell you that if you continue to do what you are doing here,
[01:36:26.742 --> 01:36:28.583]  This could be the biggest story of the year.
[01:36:29.523 --> 01:36:35.444]  Because you have to understand, he said the Border Patrol is one of the most secretive agencies in the government.
[01:36:36.324 --> 01:36:40.705]  He said their newspaper, a Gannett newspaper, can't get anything out of them.
[01:36:41.406 --> 01:36:44.086]  They requested just a copy of their budget.
[01:36:44.926 --> 01:36:47.527]  They refused to release a copy of their budget.
[01:36:48.307 --> 01:36:51.288]  They had to submit a Freedom of Information Act request.
[01:36:51.889 --> 01:36:54.171]  They said it would take two years.
[01:36:54.992 --> 01:37:04.020]  The Border Patrol is being run by a bunch of anti-Americans who do not want America to know what's going on at the border.
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:11.427]  What we are about to do here, Alex, is cut through that nonsense and tell America directly.
[01:37:12.176 --> 01:37:13.819]  How many people are crossing the border?
[01:37:14.319 --> 01:37:15.401]  Where they are crossing?
[01:37:15.461 --> 01:37:17.264]  We will show you pictures of them.
[01:37:17.685 --> 01:37:19.728]  We will get an actual count.
[01:37:20.208 --> 01:37:24.174]  And we will find out who and when and what.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:26.440]  And we're doing it.
[01:37:26.741 --> 01:37:32.343]  Now, Glenn Spencer, your description sounds like the Batcave, and it's great, and it didn't grow overnight.
[01:37:32.503 --> 01:37:32.743]  No.
[01:37:32.924 --> 01:37:44.729]  You were instrumental with others in the front lines getting the different propositions passed to watch Gray Davis just throw them out as a dictator, and they're now saying that it may, quote, be legal to have a recall.
[01:37:44.829 --> 01:37:46.510]  It's criminal to have a recall.
[01:37:46.530 --> 01:37:47.891]  The Democrats are trying to say that.
[01:37:48.755 --> 01:37:48.875]  Right.
[01:37:48.915 --> 01:37:49.196]  Right.
[01:37:49.216 --> 01:37:49.416]  Right.
[01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:05.273]  Yes.
[01:38:05.293 --> 01:38:05.373]  Yes.
[01:38:28.779 --> 01:38:32.501]  Yeah, there's foreign troops running around down there, now mainstream news.
[01:38:32.901 --> 01:38:41.385]  All of this is happening, so over the years you've built this up, you've got your sensors on people's ranches and areas, you've got your drones, private drones.
[01:38:41.925 --> 01:38:44.267]  The government's drones are going to be used to watch our cities.
[01:38:44.527 --> 01:38:44.707]  Right.
[01:38:44.987 --> 01:38:55.472]  You're down there fighting, and you're showing people what they don't want the American people to know, that while they tell us to give up our liberty for security and give up our rights, that there is no border.
[01:38:55.492 --> 01:38:57.633]  Oh, there's no question about it.
[01:38:58.254 --> 01:39:04.836]  I mean, we have our first batch of 25 sensors.
[01:39:05.156 --> 01:39:13.579]  This is a brand new design manufactured right here from the component level with some of the top circuit designers in the country working with us.
[01:39:14.039 --> 01:39:20.361]  We've come up with a new system, a new whole idea of sensing people coming across the border.
[01:39:21.001 --> 01:39:27.163]  Radio signals are set, sent up to repeaters on hilltops, mountaintops, and then sent to our headquarters.
[01:39:27.603 --> 01:39:31.105]  So anybody walking along the border, now we built 25 of these prototypes.
[01:39:31.165 --> 01:39:32.025]  They work beautifully.
[01:39:32.465 --> 01:39:34.786]  We only have eight of them right now installed.
[01:39:35.106 --> 01:39:36.887]  We're installing about two a day.
[01:39:37.167 --> 01:39:38.468]  We hope to get up to four a day.
[01:39:38.748 --> 01:39:40.648]  We're ordering 500 of them.
[01:39:41.389 --> 01:39:43.009]  These will be installed on the border.
[01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:45.510]  We are now getting a hit.
[01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:51.233]  Just out of these eight that we have out there, about one every three hours we pick up a group coming across the border.
[01:39:51.793 --> 01:39:53.854]  Just imagine when we have 500 of them out there.
[01:39:55.089 --> 01:39:58.111]  We're going to know when anybody steps across that border.
[01:39:58.151 --> 01:40:00.532]  We're going to know about it and we're going to tell the Border Patrol.
[01:40:00.552 --> 01:40:17.863]  We're going to send unmanned aerial vehicles over to take their picture, send that over the Internet and show the American people that this little group, just using donated funds, just using the money and using the technology of some very clever Americans, can do this job and embarrass...
[01:40:18.815 --> 01:40:27.013]  As I said on CNN the other day, on the Wolf Blitzer Report, if we have to embarrass our country, our government, to do its job, so be it.
[01:40:28.283 --> 01:40:29.784]  And we are getting the attention.
[01:40:30.205 --> 01:40:33.447]  Just as you were calling, I got a call from ABC News in Phoenix.
[01:40:33.807 --> 01:40:35.228]  They're sending a crew down there.
[01:40:35.549 --> 01:40:42.114]  We have sent live video images from our UAV out over Lester Holt Live on MSNBC.
[01:40:42.134 --> 01:40:54.123]  So millions of people could look right down on the border from our airplane in a high resolution camera, car camera, and see people walking along this trail leading into the United States.
[01:40:54.743 --> 01:40:55.744]  And we did that live.
[01:40:56.545 --> 01:40:59.067]  I think we just lost Glenn's cell phone.
[01:40:59.087 --> 01:40:59.888]  Bad connection.
[01:41:00.288 --> 01:41:03.310]  We'll try to reconnect and get Glenn Spencer back on.
[01:41:19.463 --> 01:41:30.592]  And you notice the neocons will talk about some of the real issues and have good folks like Glenn Spencer on, but in the end equation, they don't put the heat on Lord Bush, who can stop all this basically instantaneously.
[01:41:31.893 --> 01:41:34.715]  And they've now ordered Border Patrol not to stop the illegals.
[01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:38.238]  They've ordered them instead to go out on trash detail and pick up trash.
[01:41:39.239 --> 01:41:43.863]  They've ordered them not to shoot back at Mexican troops, in some cases are 20 miles over the border shooting at them.
[01:41:44.403 --> 01:41:47.986]  Federal officers, Border Patrol, Park Service have been killed.
[01:41:48.757 --> 01:41:49.237]  We're good to go.
[01:41:49.277 --> 01:41:49.537]  I think?
[01:42:09.668 --> 01:42:34.763]  So this is the reality, my friends, and the majority of Americans, regardless of color, know this is common sense, know you don't have a country without borders and sovereignty, and we have got the support what Glenn Spencer and others are doing, and by Glenn having these sensors and these drones and these cameras and just showing in their little corner of this fight what's happening, it shows how the Border Patrol is doing nothing.
[01:42:35.403 --> 01:42:36.504]  Glenn, good to have you back on.
[01:42:37.004 --> 01:42:38.105]  Sorry, we got disconnected.
[01:42:38.695 --> 01:42:40.817]  I don't know where we were because I was on a monologue.
[01:42:41.257 --> 01:42:44.519]  No, well, you were making a lot of good points is what you were doing.
[01:42:44.559 --> 01:42:49.243]  But, Glenn, now... Oh, oh, oh, just a second.
[01:42:49.443 --> 01:42:50.744]  Did you hear that?
[01:42:51.965 --> 01:42:52.205]  Yes.
[01:42:52.325 --> 01:42:54.347]  Okay, that is our sensor going off.
[01:42:55.427 --> 01:43:00.251]  Okay, this is right down by the San Pedro River coming into Arizona.
[01:43:00.951 --> 01:43:02.272]  We just picked up five people.
[01:43:03.954 --> 01:43:04.554]  You just heard it.
[01:43:05.375 --> 01:43:06.095]  Five people?
[01:43:06.335 --> 01:43:06.876]  Five people.
[01:43:08.184 --> 01:43:08.364]  Wow.
[01:43:08.404 --> 01:43:10.286]  Our sensors are computerized, and we count them.
[01:43:12.008 --> 01:43:12.568]  You just heard it.
[01:43:13.909 --> 01:43:15.190]  Yes, I did.
[01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:16.091]  Boop, boop, boop, boop.
[01:43:16.411 --> 01:43:18.473]  And it flashes up on a computer screen.
[01:43:18.753 --> 01:43:21.636]  It gives the exact location and the exact number of people.
[01:43:22.136 --> 01:43:24.819]  And now on national TV, you've had your drones out.
[01:43:24.859 --> 01:43:25.319]  No, this is not.
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:29.843]  We're not sending this out right yet until we get all of our testing done.
[01:43:29.863 --> 01:43:30.824]  I'm talking about your drones.
[01:43:30.864 --> 01:43:31.825]  So this is captured right here.
[01:43:32.927 --> 01:43:36.469]  But we will eventually, but we will not do this.
[01:43:36.549 --> 01:43:42.392]  We will not give the actual locations up on the Internet, and there's a reason for that.
[01:43:43.292 --> 01:43:49.776]  These people are attacked, murdered, and robbed by Mexican bandits, no matter where they are.
[01:43:50.656 --> 01:43:56.899]  And if we showed them where they were, they would be subject to attack, not by Americans, but by their own countrymen.
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:58.780]  Yeah, by the coyotes.
[01:43:58.881 --> 01:43:59.621]  By the coyotes.
[01:44:01.841 --> 01:44:05.226]  We will show live video pictures eventually.
[01:44:05.567 --> 01:44:07.209]  We can do it now, but we don't do it every day.
[01:44:07.229 --> 01:44:08.712]  That's what I was talking about.
[01:44:08.732 --> 01:44:11.677]  You can look down and see them, but you won't know exactly where they are.
[01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:16.888]  We don't give the exact location to anyone except the Border Patrol.
[01:44:17.308 --> 01:44:19.269]  Now, what about Morris Sleaze?
[01:44:19.569 --> 01:44:19.969]  Oh, gosh.
[01:44:20.129 --> 01:44:26.952]  He's trying to shut down Americans, showing the federal crimes being committed by the tens of thousands every day.
[01:44:26.972 --> 01:44:27.392]  Right.
[01:44:27.672 --> 01:44:28.892]  What's going on with him right now?
[01:44:29.312 --> 01:44:30.253]  Well, he's after us.
[01:44:30.613 --> 01:44:31.393]  He's after me.
[01:44:32.174 --> 01:44:41.117]  He and the Southern Poverty Law Center have tied up, have joined in with a gal by the name of Isabel Garcia and her group, Derechos Humanos.
[01:44:42.445 --> 01:44:45.128]  It said rights, you know, human rights.
[01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:55.778]  Yeah, if you don't put water centers out there in emergency packs and don't give them basically a first-class railway ticket in here, you're evil.
[01:44:56.759 --> 01:44:57.759]  So stay there, Glenn Spencer.
[01:44:57.799 --> 01:45:00.902]  We'll talk about it on the other side when we get back and talk more about those drones.
[01:45:03.985 --> 01:45:04.646]  Commodities.
[01:45:05.126 --> 01:45:05.707]  Futures.
[01:45:06.367 --> 01:45:06.848]  Options.
[01:45:07.668 --> 01:45:08.469]  We're good to go.
[01:45:08.509 --> 01:45:08.669]  I think?
[01:45:24.461 --> 01:45:25.562]  Right now the U.S.
[01:45:25.662 --> 01:45:30.244]  trade deficit and budget deficits are rising to historical levels.
[01:45:30.744 --> 01:45:35.727]  Interest rates are at some of the lowest levels we have ever seen, and yet the economy is still weak.
[01:45:36.127 --> 01:45:38.488]  And we feel this could spell trouble for the dollar.
[01:45:38.828 --> 01:45:42.010]  To Barclay Financial, that spells opportunity.
[01:45:42.490 --> 01:45:43.250]  Barclay Financial.
[01:45:43.290 --> 01:45:43.891]  Mystery solved.
[01:46:04.295 --> 01:46:15.024]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:46:15.204 --> 01:46:22.831]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:23.071 --> 01:46:26.194]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:46:26.334 --> 01:46:26.774]  We're good to go.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.963]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:46:51.183 --> 01:46:55.445]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:46:55.465 --> 01:46:55.905]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:47:03.969 --> 01:47:08.316]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:08.496 --> 01:47:12.922]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:13.063 --> 01:47:17.469]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:47:17.509 --> 01:47:18.831]  The New World Order.
[01:47:20.613 --> 01:47:24.835]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:47:24.895 --> 01:47:31.838]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:47:31.958 --> 01:47:34.059]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:34.339 --> 01:47:43.643]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings.
[01:47:44.943 --> 01:47:50.305]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:47:50.825 --> 01:47:53.446]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:47:53.466 --> 01:47:54.046]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:47:54.066 --> 01:47:54.586]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:47:54.606 --> 01:47:55.886]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:48:12.384 --> 01:48:16.466]  Listeners can probably hear Glenn Spencer and myself hyperventilating on the air.
[01:48:16.486 --> 01:48:17.686]  Glenn said, I don't know where to start.
[01:48:17.706 --> 01:48:18.467]  There's so much.
[01:48:19.367 --> 01:48:20.828]  Time is being compressed.
[01:48:20.888 --> 01:48:22.448]  He talks about a last stand.
[01:48:23.309 --> 01:48:27.070]  You're not in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California.
[01:48:27.691 --> 01:48:28.751]  You don't know, folks.
[01:48:28.811 --> 01:48:29.912]  There is no border.
[01:48:30.992 --> 01:48:33.133]  There are tens of millions of people trying to come here.
[01:48:34.304 --> 01:48:34.865]  We're good to go.
[01:48:51.178 --> 01:48:54.599]  And Glenn Morris Dees, I mean, the guy is a piece of work.
[01:48:54.639 --> 01:48:59.821]  His training manuals say that constitutionalists, gun owners, people that don't like the U.N.
[01:48:59.881 --> 01:49:00.321]  are bad.
[01:49:00.761 --> 01:49:09.344]  They're demonizing whole classes of society but defending Mecha and La Raza, truly racist organizations.
[01:49:09.404 --> 01:49:11.464]  I mean, La Raza means the race.
[01:49:11.564 --> 01:49:14.625]  Mecha says, you know, push all the whites out, kill them.
[01:49:14.645 --> 01:49:16.486]  They said it on TV, on their websites.
[01:49:17.106 --> 01:49:18.087]  This is wrong.
[01:49:18.567 --> 01:49:27.531]  I've spoken out against the Klan and spoken out against everybody, but how do they get this free ride and are we starting to see a shift to them not getting a free ride?
[01:49:28.791 --> 01:49:31.832]  Well, I don't see it.
[01:49:33.113 --> 01:49:35.534]  I think I see Americans getting the shaft.
[01:49:36.332 --> 01:49:37.813]  Well, they're still getting the free ride.
[01:49:37.853 --> 01:49:42.095]  I know people who are ill and cannot get in to see doctors.
[01:49:42.815 --> 01:49:53.780]  We know in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, if you go to a hospital and you're not a resident of Los Angeles County, they will throw you out, even though you're a U.S.
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:54.240]  citizen.
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:50:00.963]  But if you go to a hospital in Los Angeles County, you happen to have a county address, and you're an illegal alien, they take you in.
[01:50:01.383 --> 01:50:03.824]  So they're throwing out citizens onto the street
[01:50:04.965 --> 01:50:06.707]  And taking care of illegal aliens.
[01:50:07.148 --> 01:50:09.291]  So I don't see any reversal in this.
[01:50:11.525 --> 01:50:12.165]  Well, I have to tell you.
[01:50:12.185 --> 01:50:13.145]  That's a fact.
[01:50:13.165 --> 01:50:14.306]  I have to tell you.
[01:50:14.346 --> 01:50:17.666]  It just depends on how far you can push the American people.
[01:50:18.126 --> 01:50:21.447]  Apparently, you can push them into the ocean before they do anything.
[01:50:21.947 --> 01:50:23.087]  That's what we're getting to see.
[01:50:23.227 --> 01:50:26.448]  And by the way, while we were talking, we got another hit on a sensor.
[01:50:27.088 --> 01:50:30.708]  A few, about a mile away from the other one, a group coming in.
[01:50:31.028 --> 01:50:34.909]  They come up this San Pedro River because it's lined with trees out here in the desert.
[01:50:35.249 --> 01:50:36.529]  And it has trees on the other side.
[01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:37.610]  And they walk up.
[01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:39.430]  And the Border Patrol knows they come up there.
[01:50:40.484 --> 01:50:41.885]  But they don't do anything about it.
[01:50:41.966 --> 01:50:47.771]  Now we're going to be flying our drones over that river on a regular basis and sending pictures back.
[01:50:47.811 --> 01:50:51.455]  We'll say, here they are, here they are, here they are, and where's the border patrol?
[01:50:51.475 --> 01:50:53.597]  We're going to do that every day and every night.
[01:50:54.764 --> 01:50:55.664]  But Glenn... But Glenn... But Glenn...
[01:51:15.524 --> 01:51:21.609]  In the heartland of America, they set up checkpoints and search everybody's car and throw our goods out on the road.
[01:51:21.629 --> 01:51:29.176]  And when they catch illegals, even vans packed with illegals, the INS orders the police not to arrest them and to let them go.
[01:51:29.436 --> 01:51:29.816]  That's right.
[01:51:29.836 --> 01:51:35.501]  Now, if you were an American citizen driving without a license, you would be cited, right?
[01:51:36.262 --> 01:51:38.824]  And you would be given an order to appear.
[01:51:38.844 --> 01:51:40.546]  And if you didn't appear, they'd come and arrest you.
[01:51:40.806 --> 01:51:41.747]  These people, they just let go.
[01:51:42.970 --> 01:51:46.091]  I mean, this is a super citizenship.
[01:51:46.512 --> 01:51:50.873]  That means they have all the rights you do, but no obligations, no responsibilities.
[01:51:51.294 --> 01:51:52.194]  This is wonderful.
[01:51:54.215 --> 01:52:00.377]  Well, the new matricula, they find guys with six different matriculas in their pocket, three different ones, 12 different ones in one case.
[01:52:00.417 --> 01:52:01.838]  They'll just issue them to anybody.
[01:52:01.878 --> 01:52:03.799]  Now all these foreign countries are saying they'll do it.
[01:52:04.679 --> 01:52:06.300]  800 cities are saying they're going along with it.
[01:52:07.961 --> 01:52:08.901]  Oh, this is great.
[01:52:10.123 --> 01:52:12.045]  You know, you don't need a driver's license anymore.
[01:52:12.065 --> 01:52:14.586]  You get into an accident, you know what we're going to start doing?
[01:52:14.887 --> 01:52:21.092]  We're going to start printing out matricular consular cards for anybody who wants to log on to our website.
[01:52:21.712 --> 01:52:22.733]  You might want to do it too.
[01:52:22.773 --> 01:52:26.175]  Just charge them $15 and you print it up and send it to them.
[01:52:26.195 --> 01:52:28.557]  And then when they get stopped by the cops, just hand it to them.
[01:52:29.758 --> 01:52:33.721]  You know, say I'm from Belize.
[01:52:33.801 --> 01:52:35.122]  Here's my consular card.
[01:52:35.142 --> 01:52:36.904]  What do you mean you're not going to take it?
[01:52:36.924 --> 01:52:39.546]  You're discriminating against me just because I speak English?
[01:52:41.181 --> 01:52:42.502]  Yeah, I think that's the answer.
[01:52:42.542 --> 01:52:44.203]  Glenn, can you stay with us a little bit longer?
[01:52:44.223 --> 01:52:44.743]  Sure.
[01:52:45.223 --> 01:52:50.766]  All right, I want to take some calls from Ron and Spencer and others that are holding and maybe play some of these clips that Glenn's got.
[01:52:50.786 --> 01:52:51.426]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:55.428 --> 01:52:59.951]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:53:00.271 --> 01:53:04.313]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:53:08.712 --> 01:53:11.933]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.456 --> 01:53:20.097]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.757 --> 01:53:21.837]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.538 --> 01:53:23.698]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:23.718 --> 01:53:25.159]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.859 --> 01:53:26.739]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.321]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.601 --> 01:53:35.723]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:42.050]  Alright folks, we've got Glenn Spencer from AmericanPatrol.com on the line with us.
[01:53:42.811 --> 01:54:01.716]  Earlier we had the head of the Senate of Colorado, Senate President John Andrews on, where he said that we basically have a governmental movement using a race consciousness out of Mexico to take over the U.S.
[01:54:02.257 --> 01:54:03.557]  and Washington is funding it.
[01:54:04.489 --> 01:54:07.011]  9-1-1 repeat would be fault of Bush.
[01:54:07.231 --> 01:54:09.212]  Congressman, GOP lawmaker charges.
[01:54:09.232 --> 01:54:10.773]  That's what Tom Tancredo said.
[01:54:10.793 --> 01:54:18.177]  And Lord Bush is saying he's going to target Tancredo for defeat and re-election, but he doesn't have a chance of doing it because Tancredo is so popular.
[01:54:18.758 --> 01:54:23.260]  We've got Glenn Spencer on with us, and we are going to get to Ron and Spencer and others here in a second.
[01:54:24.441 --> 01:54:25.902]  Glenn, I've got this article here.
[01:54:25.982 --> 01:54:27.663]  This is out of Wildcat News.
[01:54:28.683 --> 01:54:30.905]  Anniversary Sparks Mecha Reunion.
[01:54:32.049 --> 01:54:48.719]  And it says that it's about the revolutionary movement of Aslan, and they're in the public schools, basically, teaching the little kids this... I mean, could we have... I mean, I wouldn't want to, but can we have the Aryan nations teach little white kids their race consciousness?
[01:54:48.739 --> 01:54:49.459]  Of course not.
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:51.320]  Of course not.
[01:54:52.281 --> 01:54:59.085]  Because anything that is anti-white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant male is okay.
[01:54:59.105 --> 01:55:00.966]  You have to understand that.
[01:55:01.764 --> 01:55:09.968]  Anything that's anti-wasp, anti-white Anglo-Saxon Protestant can be done.
[01:55:10.389 --> 01:55:14.731]  Anything done by white Anglo-Saxon Protestant males...
[01:55:15.701 --> 01:55:21.485]  This is a war on the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant male.
[01:55:22.585 --> 01:55:25.087]  Pure and simple, he is to be targeted.
[01:55:25.587 --> 01:55:27.408]  He is to be eliminated.
[01:55:27.488 --> 01:55:28.909]  This is the final solution.
[01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:38.355]  Now, this ethnic cleansing against white Anglo-Saxon Protestant males is being run by a bunch of white Anglo-Saxon Protestant males out of New York.
[01:55:38.435 --> 01:55:39.516]  Why are they doing this, Glenn?
[01:55:40.677 --> 01:55:41.077]  I don't know.
[01:55:42.250 --> 01:55:44.532]  That's the $64 billion question.
[01:55:44.552 --> 01:55:49.016]  Well, you said before it's to drive down wages, get people to vote.
[01:55:49.096 --> 01:55:51.678]  I know why some of them are doing it.
[01:55:51.698 --> 01:55:52.618]  They're paid to do it.
[01:55:52.758 --> 01:55:54.259]  And destroy national sovereignty.
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:56.361]  Destroy national sovereignty.
[01:55:57.102 --> 01:56:05.208]  I mean, we had yesterday on our feature, we had this Victor Davis Hanson who wrote the book, Mexifornia, A State of Becoming.
[01:56:05.228 --> 01:56:10.952]  And Buchanan asked him, he is a professor, he is a well-known writer, an intellectual,
[01:56:11.815 --> 01:56:20.162]  Buchanan says, why is it that all the politicians, or most of them, are seemingly paralyzed when dealing with what is an invasion from Mexico?
[01:56:20.222 --> 01:56:21.924]  And Hanson says, I don't know.
[01:56:22.504 --> 01:56:23.465]  It baffles me.
[01:56:24.006 --> 01:56:24.526]  Well, me too.
[01:56:25.287 --> 01:56:28.589]  There's something going on that is just inexplicable.
[01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:30.151]  Well, Glenn, you said it over and over again.
[01:56:30.211 --> 01:56:32.513]  It's like the invasion of the body snatchers.
[01:56:33.348 --> 01:56:35.111]  Well, Glenn, you said it over and over again.
[01:56:35.131 --> 01:56:39.218]  You said America's being sacrificed on the altar of globalism.
[01:56:39.598 --> 01:56:43.024]  The UN documents say they want to get rid of all borders and sovereignty.
[01:56:43.144 --> 01:56:46.430]  Well, the Ford Foundation certainly puts up the money.
[01:56:47.759 --> 01:56:52.342]  They created the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, MALDEF.
[01:56:52.783 --> 01:56:57.686]  They created the National Council of the Race, or the National Council of La Raza.
[01:56:58.166 --> 01:57:06.212]  They financed the National Lawyers Guild, once described by the Congress as the legal bulwark of the Communist Party in America.
[01:57:06.952 --> 01:57:10.454]  We know that the Mexican government wants to conquer the Southwest.
[01:57:10.815 --> 01:57:15.998]  We know the Ford Foundation wants to destroy all borders, but what we don't know, what
[01:57:15.998 --> 01:57:23.125]  What baffles us is why elected representatives of the American people have turned against the people themselves.
[01:57:24.106 --> 01:57:25.087]  As if they hate.
[01:57:25.708 --> 01:57:27.410]  It's like self-flagellation.
[01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:32.315]  It's like a bunch of Iranians marching down the street beating themselves with palm fronds.
[01:57:33.376 --> 01:57:34.477]  This is irrational.
[01:57:35.058 --> 01:57:37.320]  It's as if we are on a guilt trip.
[01:57:38.368 --> 01:57:42.437]  For having succeeded so well and others having failed.
[01:57:42.637 --> 01:57:45.884]  So we are to be destroyed because of our success.
[01:57:45.944 --> 01:57:47.849]  It's some kind of mass insanity.
[01:57:49.028 --> 01:57:49.949]  Glenn Spencer, stay there.
[01:57:49.969 --> 01:57:51.390]  I promise these callers, we get to them.
[01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:53.792]  Ron Spencer, others that are holding.
[01:57:53.852 --> 01:57:55.253]  Toll-free number to join us on air.
[01:57:55.273 --> 01:57:58.676]  If you want to talk to Glenn Spencer, 800-259-9231.
[01:57:58.696 --> 01:58:02.579]  And I want to recap that, folks.
[01:58:02.619 --> 01:58:11.326]  You can have groups called the Rates, calling for all white people to be physically kicked out of the U.S., kicked out of the Southwest, and that's acceptable.
[01:58:11.846 --> 01:58:12.787]  It is not acceptable.
[01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:17.382]  Did you remember to take your focus factor this morning?
[01:58:17.802 --> 01:58:18.062]  No?
[01:58:18.442 --> 01:58:19.042]  Too bad.
[01:58:19.482 --> 01:58:28.224]  Every morning, men, women, and children across the country start their day with focus factor because they rely on it to feed their brain from the time they get up to the time they go to bed.
[01:58:28.704 --> 01:58:39.306]  Focus factor contains vitamins, minerals, protective antioxidants, botanical extracts, and omega-3 fatty acids, some of which have been demonstrated in clinical studies to support healthy brain function.
[01:58:39.726 --> 01:58:42.907]  Focus factor is perfect for business professionals, homemakers,
[01:58:42.927 --> 01:58:43.948]  We're good to go.
[01:58:58.024 --> 01:58:58.184]  Call 1-800-893-6870.
[01:59:14.495 --> 01:59:18.839]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:19.019 --> 01:59:23.442]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:23.602 --> 01:59:27.986]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:59:28.026 --> 01:59:29.347]  The New World Order.
[01:59:30.031 --> 01:59:31.533]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:46.351 --> 01:59:55.294]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:55.494 --> 02:00:00.876]  If you want to understand what the new rule of order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:01:14.855 --> 02:01:22.562]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:22.582 --> 02:01:28.567]  All right, we're talking to Glenn Spencer of AmericanPatrol.com.
[02:01:28.607 --> 02:01:29.828]  He was out in California.
[02:01:29.848 --> 02:01:36.294]  He was instrumental in getting Prop 187 and other constitutionally-based referendums rammed through.
[02:01:36.934 --> 02:01:42.479]  Governor Gray dictator Davis said that he didn't care and had it thrown out.
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:50.761]  And now that state has fallen into total corruption and bedlam and bankruptcy, which is what the globalists wanted, to get total control.
[02:01:51.682 --> 02:01:56.082]  Now he's in Arizona, and he's got surveillance drones out in the desert.
[02:01:56.123 --> 02:01:57.183]  They've got sensors.
[02:01:57.763 --> 02:02:02.804]  He was on Lester Holt live and streamed some of the video of the invasion.
[02:02:02.864 --> 02:02:05.164]  The Border Patrol will not show up, will not do anything.
[02:02:05.184 --> 02:02:08.785]  We're going to talk to Ron, Spencer, Jason, and a few other callers, and then I want...
[02:02:09.412 --> 02:02:24.857]  Glenn Spencer to tell us what Mecha is, what La Raza is, how it's funded by the white boys over at the Ford Foundation, a bunch of socialists, using racial consciousness, the politically correct racial consciousness, to take over society.
[02:02:24.897 --> 02:02:25.798]  It's a powerful force.
[02:02:26.158 --> 02:02:26.878]  They're doing it.
[02:02:27.398 --> 02:02:35.661]  And then now how, of course, the Southern Poverty Law Center is trying to cover Glenn Spencer for simply showing video of illegals committing felonies.
[02:02:37.082 --> 02:02:39.825]  Glenn, anything else you want to throw in real quick before we go to these callers?
[02:02:40.225 --> 02:02:42.147]  Well, just this.
[02:02:42.888 --> 02:02:47.673]  Just like you should support Alex, we are supported by the American people.
[02:02:48.254 --> 02:02:55.201]  And what we need to do is talk to our friends and say, look, people like Morris Dees, you know he has $135 million in the bank.
[02:02:58.375 --> 02:03:01.436]  They bring in about $30 million a year.
[02:03:02.016 --> 02:03:05.917]  He makes, personally, $258,000 a year.
[02:03:06.657 --> 02:03:07.217]  My gosh.
[02:03:07.717 --> 02:03:13.419]  You know, if we had the kind of money Morris Dees had, we could have this border controlled in a New York minute.
[02:03:13.939 --> 02:03:19.180]  But the worry has to go out that the American people, this has to be like a march of dimes.
[02:03:20.043 --> 02:03:30.853]  But it has to be, you know, a march of the people and their pennies and nickels and dimes and, yes, dollars, have to go to people like Alex Jones and American Border Patrol.
[02:03:31.273 --> 02:03:46.467]  And we have to let the people know that we're going to have to do it ourselves, set up a little tin can up there, save a few bucks each week, think about cutting back on those McDonald's hamburgers and put a few dollars away each week and help one of these groups.
[02:03:47.583 --> 02:03:58.495]  Well, absolutely, and you certainly, you've done films, you've done all these rallies, you've educated people, you have not compromised, and it is bearing fruit.
[02:03:59.498 --> 02:04:01.861]  And folks, we don't have a country if we don't control our border.
[02:04:01.941 --> 02:04:13.094]  It's destroying our wages, it's destroying our sovereignty, and the Ford Foundation and the federal government has said it is about destroying borders and our sovereignty and the Pan-American Union.
[02:04:13.134 --> 02:04:17.418]  It's like education that Bush just signed on to with UNESCO, the United Nations.
[02:04:17.779 --> 02:04:19.721]  They say, we read their document last week,
[02:04:20.350 --> 02:04:23.555]  The family is a disease and must be eradicated.
[02:04:23.895 --> 02:04:27.320]  And then you wonder why the family's being destroyed, why the policies destroy the family.
[02:04:27.841 --> 02:04:29.162]  Just like they're destroying the border.
[02:04:29.623 --> 02:04:34.550]  Their goal, Bush says he'll sign the assault weapons ban that Clinton passed.
[02:04:34.650 --> 02:04:35.872]  He's going to add stuff to it.
[02:04:37.149 --> 02:04:44.016]  Bush knows that 80-plus percent of Americans, including Hispanics, want the border controlled, want national sovereignty.
[02:04:44.056 --> 02:04:44.917]  It's common sense.
[02:04:45.337 --> 02:04:50.642]  You said you don't know why the government, despite this, won't do what's constitutional and the will of the people.
[02:04:50.983 --> 02:04:56.208]  How do we pressure Lord Bush to not go along with destroying America?
[02:04:56.855 --> 02:05:01.139]  Well, we'll keep trying everything we can.
[02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:12.811]  Just before we got on the air, because of this drone and these sensors have caught the imagination of the American people, I just got a call from ABC TV.
[02:05:13.171 --> 02:05:14.433]  They're coming down from Phoenix.
[02:05:14.553 --> 02:05:15.414]  While we're on the air...
[02:05:16.234 --> 02:05:18.696]  My assistant just handed me a note.
[02:05:18.816 --> 02:05:19.076]  U.S.
[02:05:19.296 --> 02:05:21.198]  News and World Report wants to talk to me.
[02:05:21.638 --> 02:05:29.343]  We have TV, all kinds of people coming down here, because I think they know we're about to blow the lid off of these things, just like you do with your videos.
[02:05:29.563 --> 02:05:34.687]  And you said that the reporter yesterday said it's obvious you're not a vigilante, it's obvious you're not bad.
[02:05:34.707 --> 02:05:35.587]  Right.
[02:05:35.607 --> 02:05:45.434]  You guys try to go down and cover the murder of federal officers by illegals, by coyotes, by drug dealers, by Mexican tribes, and then the media and Morris Dees says that you're bad.
[02:05:46.214 --> 02:05:47.295]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:05:47.676 --> 02:05:48.456]  We just got a call.
[02:05:48.496 --> 02:05:49.417]  It was yesterday morning.
[02:05:49.477 --> 02:05:51.519]  I was down again on the San Pedro River.
[02:05:51.539 --> 02:05:53.740]  There's an estate down there, a caretaker.
[02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:56.222]  The guy who owns the estate gave him the approval to call us.
[02:05:56.703 --> 02:05:58.264]  They are so frightened now.
[02:05:59.505 --> 02:06:00.986]  They have a little caretaker cabin.
[02:06:01.706 --> 02:06:05.727]  They're starting to pound on the windows of the cabin because they want something.
[02:06:06.648 --> 02:06:08.388]  These people are becoming dangerous.
[02:06:10.509 --> 02:06:16.931]  Three days before that, we were down there with this reporter from the Tucson Citizen.
[02:06:16.951 --> 02:06:18.331]  He was down with another rancher.
[02:06:18.751 --> 02:06:22.092]  His wife was born in this ranch house 53 years ago.
[02:06:22.513 --> 02:06:26.594]  She used to go out and ride on the border with her horse and her dog as a 10-year-old kitten.
[02:06:26.614 --> 02:06:27.694]  Her mother didn't worry about it.
[02:06:27.954 --> 02:06:30.155]  She's afraid to leave the ranch house now.
[02:06:31.167 --> 02:06:33.249]  You have to understand what's going on down here.
[02:06:33.269 --> 02:06:36.213]  People are frightened to death in their own homes.
[02:06:36.613 --> 02:06:39.276]  People have lived here forever.
[02:06:39.697 --> 02:06:45.783]  Well, look, there's been murders, there's been killings, there's been robberies, and millions of illegals.
[02:06:45.823 --> 02:06:46.704]  It's got to be stopped.
[02:06:46.745 --> 02:06:50.869]  Let's talk to Ron in New York, and then Spencer, Jason, and others.
[02:06:50.969 --> 02:06:51.690]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:52.411]  Thanks for holding.
[02:06:52.958 --> 02:06:53.639]  How do you do, gentlemen?
[02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:59.445]  Well, initially I called about several things, but he's touching on this issue about the border.
[02:07:00.126 --> 02:07:01.828]  I have some information.
[02:07:01.848 --> 02:07:04.851]  As a matter of fact, I wanted to speak to you about it much sooner and forgot.
[02:07:05.572 --> 02:07:15.082]  I read a civil service journal in New York, where I come from, and the Border Patrol is hiring police for the border.
[02:07:15.675 --> 02:07:22.800]  Now, I found it very odd that the requirements for this job were that you had to be fluent in Spanish.
[02:07:23.061 --> 02:07:23.581]  That's correct.
[02:07:23.621 --> 02:07:24.442]  Now, hold on.
[02:07:24.462 --> 02:07:25.142]  It goes further.
[02:07:26.223 --> 02:07:43.736]  One of the processes of recruitment or I guess the processes of hiring you is that you go in front of a three-man panel in which they make a determination as to whether you're sensitive enough to the needs of other people.
[02:07:44.503 --> 02:07:47.425]  Now, you don't have to be or go any further.
[02:07:47.605 --> 02:07:48.626]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:07:48.646 --> 02:07:49.626]  Let me stop you, Ron.
[02:07:50.066 --> 02:07:51.107]  And they train police.
[02:07:51.167 --> 02:07:51.828]  It's been in the news.
[02:07:51.848 --> 02:07:56.670]  We've had them on to be mean to us, to be separate from us, to boss us around.
[02:07:56.690 --> 02:08:00.032]  But with Border Patrol, they've got to be these little loving social workers.
[02:08:00.313 --> 02:08:05.116]  And I would add that thousands have quit to go be air marshals where they get more money.
[02:08:05.476 --> 02:08:08.438]  And so there's actually less Border Patrol now than there was a few years ago.
[02:08:08.478 --> 02:08:08.998]  Correct, Glenn?
[02:08:09.798 --> 02:08:10.499]  That is correct.
[02:08:10.539 --> 02:08:13.542]  They have lost quite a few people to the Air Marshal program.
[02:08:13.762 --> 02:08:20.448]  Gentlemen, if I might interject, what I think is going on here is a step beyond, I think, what either one of you bring up.
[02:08:20.789 --> 02:08:22.430]  No, no, you are absolutely right.
[02:08:22.690 --> 02:08:23.871]  We're very familiar with that.
[02:08:23.891 --> 02:08:30.658]  They're attempting to recruit people who are, in fact, amiable to the idea...
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:32.321]  Let me underline what you just said.
[02:08:32.341 --> 02:08:33.222]  A rancher reported to me
[02:08:52.868 --> 02:08:56.351]  That he had reported four illegals on his ranch.
[02:08:56.951 --> 02:09:05.758]  The Border Patrol came and picked them up, and the first thing the lead Border Patrol agent, who was Hispanic, did was shake the hand of one of the illegals.
[02:09:06.598 --> 02:09:08.820]  Well, this is what I'm saying, and this is being done.
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:10.121]  You've got to understand something, too.
[02:09:10.879 --> 02:09:17.606]  People got to wake up to the fact that you're actually paying because, of course, the Border Patrol is paid for by our tax revenue.
[02:09:18.006 --> 02:09:20.649]  You're paying for the rope that's being used to hang you.
[02:09:20.669 --> 02:09:24.773]  Ron, I agree, Ron, but it's about the hospitals are blown out.
[02:09:25.213 --> 02:09:27.155]  You can't get into an emergency room.
[02:09:27.756 --> 02:09:30.579]  In California, the illegals get more tuition than citizens.
[02:09:30.999 --> 02:09:32.821]  It is about bringing this country down.
[02:09:32.861 --> 02:09:33.802]  Thanks for the call, Ron.
[02:09:34.617 --> 02:09:35.317]  Really good point.
[02:09:35.417 --> 02:09:37.718]  Spencer in Ohio, you're on the air with Glenn Spencer.
[02:09:37.759 --> 02:09:38.159]  Go ahead.
[02:09:38.779 --> 02:09:39.799]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:44.302]  I'm trying to figure out why JFK vetoed Operation Northwood.
[02:09:44.442 --> 02:09:49.144]  Well, it's because it was an extremely corrupt plan created by the U.S.
[02:09:49.244 --> 02:09:53.846]  government, but that's all secondary compared to these satellite drones.
[02:09:57.067 --> 02:10:00.209]  These satellite drones have atomic capabilities
[02:10:00.811 --> 02:10:08.257]  Okay, sir, I appreciate the call.
[02:10:08.417 --> 02:10:10.318]  All new cell phones are satellite tracked.
[02:10:10.358 --> 02:10:12.960]  Federal law went into effect October 26, 2000.
[02:10:14.081 --> 02:10:15.402]  As for Northwoods, that was a U.S.
[02:10:15.442 --> 02:10:19.005]  government terror plan operation that we've talked about a lot.
[02:10:19.025 --> 02:10:20.086]  Let's go back to Glenn Spencer.
[02:10:20.106 --> 02:10:24.249]  I just heard one of your motion sensors were the illegals pouring across the property.
[02:10:24.849 --> 02:10:25.450]  That is correct.
[02:10:25.490 --> 02:10:28.492]  Now, this was in a canyon that comes out of the Huachuca Mountains.
[02:10:28.532 --> 02:10:32.214]  They climb up over the top of those mountains and they come out through the canyons.
[02:10:32.614 --> 02:10:35.076]  Now, this is a sensor that's up in a deep canyon.
[02:10:35.456 --> 02:10:43.201]  We had to put a repeater, a slave repeater up because these neighbors up here came to us and said, we're just at our wit's end.
[02:10:43.261 --> 02:10:47.624]  Last Sunday morning, a guy called me and he says, I've got 40 of them in my backyard.
[02:10:47.964 --> 02:10:49.205]  I can't take this anymore.
[02:10:49.726 --> 02:10:53.438]  So we went up and put sensors up in these canyons, and they're flooding out of these canyons.
[02:10:53.739 --> 02:10:56.127]  This is only about three miles from where I'm standing right now.
[02:10:57.447 --> 02:11:00.430]  So you've got eight sensors out there in the desert.
[02:11:00.450 --> 02:11:02.732]  We're going to have 25 by hopefully Monday.
[02:11:02.772 --> 02:11:03.713]  We hope to have 500.
[02:11:03.913 --> 02:11:06.695]  Now these things are about $200 a piece.
[02:11:06.716 --> 02:11:08.817]  The Border Patrol sensors, well maybe about $250.
[02:11:09.078 --> 02:11:12.441]  The Border Patrol sensors are $1,500 a piece.
[02:11:12.461 --> 02:11:14.282]  We've come up with a smarter design.
[02:11:14.763 --> 02:11:21.449]  One of the things that we do on AmericanBorderPatrol.com is to raise the money to buy these things and get them put out there.
[02:11:22.049 --> 02:11:26.093]  But, yeah, the ones we have out there are going off like mad.
[02:11:26.133 --> 02:11:27.714]  We had three of them since we've been on the air.
[02:11:28.375 --> 02:11:29.016]  Three of the eight.
[02:11:29.556 --> 02:11:31.698]  Glenn, I know you've been on a lot of the big news shows.
[02:11:31.718 --> 02:11:37.623]  You've been very articulate in touring up the racists funded by the bankers who are trying to break the country down.
[02:11:39.603 --> 02:11:52.048]  What about getting people locally in border towns to demand radio shows be put on the air to expose this, to mobilize the general population in the area?
[02:11:52.128 --> 02:11:53.108]  Well, that's what we're doing.
[02:11:53.408 --> 02:11:55.329]  We do have AmericanBorderPatrol.com.
[02:11:56.723 --> 02:11:57.344]  We're good to go.
[02:11:57.404 --> 02:11:57.624]  I think?
[02:12:17.718 --> 02:12:26.724]  Every major rancher, one guy with 22,000 acres, between Sierra Vista and the New Mexico line, is supporting us 100%.
[02:12:27.024 --> 02:12:29.526]  And they're coming in like mad now.
[02:12:29.566 --> 02:12:32.208]  The homeowners up in the canyons here, they're finding out about us.
[02:12:32.668 --> 02:12:38.632]  The small ranchers along the border, because they know that the Border Patrol does nothing about their problems.
[02:12:40.726 --> 02:12:41.287]  Absolutely.
[02:12:41.347 --> 02:12:46.651]  Imagine living out in the country and knowing that tens of thousands of people a week are in your area.
[02:12:47.192 --> 02:12:51.576]  And to know there's criminal coyotes that feed on the immigrants, on the illegals.
[02:12:52.316 --> 02:12:53.037]  Very scary.
[02:12:53.317 --> 02:12:54.038]  Glenn, stay there.
[02:12:54.098 --> 02:12:54.938]  One more segment with you.
[02:12:54.959 --> 02:12:57.461]  We're going to come back and talk to Jason and Brad.
[02:12:58.982 --> 02:13:01.943]  That'll be it for calls for our guests in the next segment.
[02:13:02.343 --> 02:13:04.885]  Then I'm going to come back and hit a bunch of news we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:13:05.365 --> 02:13:11.228]  They won't put censors on the border or control the illegals, but the feds within five years are going to remote control your cars.
[02:13:11.448 --> 02:13:12.869]  Yes, it's the Associated Press.
[02:13:15.174 --> 02:13:19.057]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:13:19.297 --> 02:13:24.742]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:13:25.022 --> 02:13:35.390]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:13:35.550 --> 02:13:39.894]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:13:40.334 --> 02:13:48.436]  And volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:13:48.696 --> 02:13:55.077]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:13:55.177 --> 02:13:59.658]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:13:59.878 --> 02:14:04.099]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:14:04.459 --> 02:14:08.780]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:09.500]  803-4438.
[02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:09.960]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:14:31.633 --> 02:14:32.294]  We're good to go.
[02:14:51.869 --> 02:14:52.509]  We're good to go.
[02:15:14.082 --> 02:15:18.345]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[02:15:18.786 --> 02:15:23.329]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[02:15:23.710 --> 02:15:28.593]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[02:15:28.954 --> 02:15:30.735]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[02:15:30.775 --> 02:15:31.816]  can barely be read.
[02:15:32.096 --> 02:15:33.057]  It has faded that much.
[02:15:33.417 --> 02:15:37.318]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[02:15:37.578 --> 02:15:45.939]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.
[02:15:46.199 --> 02:15:54.061]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95 shipping included.
[02:15:54.381 --> 02:15:58.302]  And as a special gift for ordering now, you will also receive a commemorative U.S.
[02:15:58.362 --> 02:16:00.582]  Constitution proof silver dollar with your order.
[02:16:00.922 --> 02:16:06.169]  Call now, toll free, 800-686-2237 and order the documents of freedom.
[02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:07.892]  Don't wait, do it today.
[02:16:08.232 --> 02:16:08.733]  The number, 800-686-2237.
[02:16:15.462 --> 02:16:19.085]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[02:16:19.245 --> 02:16:23.628]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:16:23.828 --> 02:16:28.311]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[02:16:28.431 --> 02:16:31.433]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[02:16:31.653 --> 02:16:32.193]  We're good to go.
[02:16:52.964 --> 02:16:55.905]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[02:16:56.065 --> 02:16:57.886]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[02:16:58.126 --> 02:17:00.766]  For more information about the Aaronizer, call toll-free.
[02:17:01.047 --> 02:17:02.807]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[02:17:02.967 --> 02:17:04.428]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[02:17:04.488 --> 02:17:04.708]  That's 877-605-9200.
[02:17:29.935 --> 02:17:43.530]  All right, we've got Glenn Spencer online with us, AmericanPatrol.com.
[02:17:43.570 --> 02:17:44.411]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:17:44.551 --> 02:17:46.052]  My website's InfoWars.com.
[02:17:47.581 --> 02:17:48.581]  Jason in Texas.
[02:17:48.601 --> 02:17:49.822]  You're on the air with Glenn Spencer.
[02:17:49.862 --> 02:17:50.242]  Go ahead.
[02:17:50.582 --> 02:17:51.683]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[02:17:52.363 --> 02:17:54.364]  I just had a question for Mr. Spencer.
[02:17:54.384 --> 02:18:10.210]  I don't understand how he can blame the councils like the, what do they say, the La Rasta councils and all that for trying to get rid of white America when his white America are the ones who aren't doing anything about the border problem.
[02:18:11.514 --> 02:18:20.460]  If they were really serious, I think that they would put a wall, like in China, from Texas, Brownsville, to San Diego.
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:30.906]  The point I'm trying to make here is that the Ford Foundation tries to make it a racial issue, powers it through racism on that side.
[02:18:31.307 --> 02:18:33.288]  Most Hispanics are against what's happening.
[02:18:33.308 --> 02:18:35.009]  The media tries to make it a racial issue.
[02:18:35.369 --> 02:18:38.131]  It's a sovereignty, an economic, a security issue.
[02:18:38.331 --> 02:18:39.952]  Well, it is opening his book, Alienation.
[02:19:07.403 --> 02:19:19.251]  Peter Brimelow, senior editor of Forbes magazine, he said that there was a sense in which America's immigration policy is Hitler's posthumous revenge on the United States.
[02:19:19.931 --> 02:19:33.220]  And by that he meant, essentially because of a backlash against Hitler and his racist Nazis, who were overthrown and killed, by the way, mostly by white Anglo-Saxon Protestant males from America,
[02:19:35.521 --> 02:19:40.563]  The white Anglo-Saxon Protestant male has been demonized, and it has worked.
[02:19:41.463 --> 02:19:43.364]  Mexico has used it against us.
[02:19:43.924 --> 02:19:48.746]  You are a bunch of Nazis if you try to protect your border.
[02:19:49.166 --> 02:19:52.487]  The reason they don't do anything is that they have essentially been emasculated.
[02:19:54.588 --> 02:19:55.549]  Is it okay if I speak?
[02:19:55.629 --> 02:19:56.609]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:19:56.729 --> 02:19:57.930]  Well, that was just my answer.
[02:19:57.990 --> 02:19:58.810]  I think it was complete.
[02:19:59.170 --> 02:20:00.051]  Whose fault is it?
[02:20:00.131 --> 02:20:02.272]  I mean, don't blame the Mexican people.
[02:20:02.432 --> 02:20:03.292]  Go to the source.
[02:20:03.352 --> 02:20:06.073]  Oh, I blame the Mexican people for violating our laws.
[02:20:06.634 --> 02:20:08.314]  They know better.
[02:20:08.634 --> 02:20:10.735]  It's just not Mexicans who are violating laws.
[02:20:10.895 --> 02:20:12.976]  Of course it isn't just Mexicans.
[02:20:13.056 --> 02:20:14.037]  I'm sure that there is a...
[02:20:14.517 --> 02:20:15.358]  We're good to go.
[02:20:15.398 --> 02:20:16.059]  We're good to go.
[02:20:34.459 --> 02:20:44.348]  Isn't it interesting that both parties, neither party, wants to bring up the immigration issue because they're afraid of alienating Hispanics.
[02:20:44.588 --> 02:20:46.790]  They don't want to close the border.
[02:20:46.830 --> 02:20:47.611]  Let me finish.
[02:20:47.931 --> 02:20:51.534]  They don't want to close the border because that would alienate Hispanics.
[02:20:51.854 --> 02:20:57.599]  And what these politicians have concluded is that all Hispanics want the borders open.
[02:20:57.799 --> 02:20:58.280]  No, sir.
[02:20:58.400 --> 02:20:59.521]  I'm one saying I don't.
[02:20:59.822 --> 02:21:03.366]  Well, I'm just telling you that that is apparently what they have concluded.
[02:21:03.507 --> 02:21:08.013]  I'm going to tell you the difference in all of America that are listening between a Hispanic and a Mexican.
[02:21:08.433 --> 02:21:10.215]  A Mexican is born in Mexico.
[02:21:10.235 --> 02:21:13.940]  Okay, I am of Mexican, Hispanic descent, but I'm not a Mexican.
[02:21:14.381 --> 02:21:15.062]  I'm Hispanic.
[02:21:15.522 --> 02:21:16.683]  I've been here over 100 years.
[02:21:16.783 --> 02:21:20.245]  My family has been here, and Alex knows about Texas.
[02:21:20.425 --> 02:21:21.826]  We're from South Texas, okay?
[02:21:21.846 --> 02:21:22.846]  Well, exactly.
[02:21:22.886 --> 02:21:24.948]  We're ranchers and farmers and everything.
[02:21:25.468 --> 02:21:26.829]  Some of them died in Germany.
[02:21:27.189 --> 02:21:33.212]  I am partly of German descent, but I wasn't a German, and my family went over and fought Germans, right?
[02:21:33.252 --> 02:21:35.314]  Yes, my grandfather was in World War II.
[02:21:35.354 --> 02:21:36.674]  My father was in Vietnam.
[02:21:36.714 --> 02:21:37.315]  There you go.
[02:21:37.695 --> 02:21:40.317]  Don't make it sound like the Mexicans have just been coming to Vegas.
[02:21:40.357 --> 02:21:40.977]  Hold on.
[02:21:41.877 --> 02:21:42.958]  Let me just interject here.
[02:21:43.298 --> 02:21:44.259]  This has gone wild.
[02:21:45.399 --> 02:21:46.700]  I don't want to censor Jason.
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:49.381]  I don't want to censor Glenn.
[02:21:50.361 --> 02:21:51.762]  If Glenn can, I know he's very busy.
[02:21:51.782 --> 02:22:00.225]  He's a few minutes into the next segment, so you guys can calmly debate this, because I get in this race trying to get all the callers in, and I want to try to do this.
[02:22:00.365 --> 02:22:02.546]  But let me just interject something here.
[02:22:03.746 --> 02:22:10.949]  In a Gallup poll, 89% of Americans, Hispanic, white, black, it didn't matter, want the border controlled, illegals deported.
[02:22:11.718 --> 02:22:12.278]  We're good to go.
[02:22:42.185 --> 02:22:43.566]  So let's discuss it.
[02:22:43.586 --> 02:22:44.546]  Stay there, Jason.
[02:22:44.566 --> 02:22:45.066]  Stay there, Glenn.
[02:22:45.087 --> 02:22:51.109]  Let's discuss it after this quick three-minute break, and then we'll let Glenn get out of here because I know he's busy, and I appreciate him joining us.
[02:22:51.129 --> 02:22:52.290]  But don't hang up, Jason.
[02:22:52.310 --> 02:22:53.210]  We'll let you make your points.
[02:22:53.891 --> 02:22:55.852]  But I think you're misunderstanding what we're saying.
[02:22:55.972 --> 02:22:57.953]  Look, there's 6.5 billion people.
[02:22:58.013 --> 02:23:00.734]  Can they all come here, or can we have a border?
[02:23:01.555 --> 02:23:02.935]  Most of them are Mexican.
[02:23:05.356 --> 02:23:06.277]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.737 --> 02:23:08.278]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.233 --> 02:23:12.074]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:14.075 --> 02:23:16.215]  Hello, everybody.
[02:23:16.275 --> 02:23:17.456]  My name is Bob Barefoot.
[02:23:17.596 --> 02:23:21.837]  I'm here today to introduce Bob Barefoot's Best Coral Calcium Supreme Plus.
[02:23:22.017 --> 02:23:29.239]  It has twice as much of the high-grade marine coral calcium from all-star black Berkeley replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:23:29.279 --> 02:23:29.719]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:23:46.181 --> 02:23:46.901]  All right, folks.
[02:23:46.981 --> 02:23:48.182]  It's Real Talk Radio.
[02:23:48.202 --> 02:23:51.365]  We talk about real issues that actually affect you and your family.
[02:23:51.865 --> 02:23:52.706]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:23:52.766 --> 02:24:00.012]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:24:00.032 --> 02:24:05.477]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:24:05.557 --> 02:24:10.281]  Now, the media owned by the globalists tries to confuse the issue.
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:30.555]  Now, I am more concerned about Russians here illegally and Chinese here illegally because the statistics show they are much higher chances that their Russian mob or Chinese triad or People Liberation Army, they've been caught doing this, they feed on their own communities.
[02:24:31.136 --> 02:24:35.299]  Hispanics are probably... I've got a background.
[02:24:35.319 --> 02:24:36.840]  Let's put everybody on hold for a second.
[02:24:37.521 --> 02:24:38.822]  I've got some background audio coming in.
[02:24:41.551 --> 02:24:48.379]  Hispanics, on average, for immigrants, are in the middle for the type of crime they bring with them.
[02:24:48.919 --> 02:24:50.201]  So it's not a racial issue.
[02:24:50.828 --> 02:24:58.590]  Frankly, white Russians are about as bad as it gets statistically, but you don't have 25 million illegal Russians here.
[02:24:58.950 --> 02:25:08.733]  And believe me, if we had 25 million illegal Russians instead of 500,000 of them or a million of them, whatever it is, if we had that, I'd be screaming bloody murder more than I am now.
[02:25:09.293 --> 02:25:12.894]  The problem is, is the liberals have added this racial system to it,
[02:25:13.547 --> 02:25:14.709]  Which is racist.
[02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:16.232]  La Raza means the race.
[02:25:16.633 --> 02:25:17.033]  Met you.
[02:25:17.114 --> 02:25:18.035]  I've been at their rallies.
[02:25:18.095 --> 02:25:22.683]  I've seen them with pictures of white people with their heads cut off saying we're going to kill all whites.
[02:25:22.763 --> 02:25:24.026]  Glenn has video of that.
[02:25:24.856 --> 02:25:31.162]  And Glenn, you were commenting that you're German, but your father went and fought the Germans in Germany.
[02:25:31.662 --> 02:25:37.407]  And I think what Jason's saying is he's a Hispanic, but he's as American as you or I, and he understands the problem.
[02:25:37.748 --> 02:25:40.950]  He just hears the terms we're using and gets confused.
[02:25:41.251 --> 02:25:42.932]  We're talking about helping everybody.
[02:25:42.952 --> 02:25:44.554]  Let's say you're a Hispanic truck driver.
[02:25:45.134 --> 02:25:52.684]  You know, more patriotic than Alex Jones or Glenn Spencer, you're a great American, you get 30 cents a mile to drive your truck, an illegal gets 3 cents a mile.
[02:25:53.045 --> 02:25:58.632]  Now, as a Hispanic American, you should be for stopping the illegal, but now legal, Mexican trucks.
[02:25:59.633 --> 02:26:01.456]  Glenn, is that the point you were trying to make?
[02:26:03.246 --> 02:26:04.207]  Let's bring Glenn Spencer back up.
[02:26:04.227 --> 02:26:13.491]  Americans fought medals of honor, loyal, great people of Hispanic descent who are hurt more by illegal immigration than anything else and anyone else.
[02:26:13.972 --> 02:26:16.893]  And there's no question about that.
[02:26:17.493 --> 02:26:23.417]  But I will tell you that the government of Mexico is very hostile toward us and is pushing its people into the United States.
[02:26:23.497 --> 02:26:24.277]  It's Nazi.
[02:26:24.357 --> 02:26:24.977]  It's Nazi.
[02:26:24.997 --> 02:26:26.298]  And you've got some of those clips.
[02:26:27.379 --> 02:26:28.079]  Well, yeah.
[02:26:28.139 --> 02:26:29.660]  Here, for example...
[02:26:30.499 --> 02:26:35.585]  And I'm having a little bit of trouble, but here is, here is, here is the deal.
[02:26:52.369 --> 02:27:05.115]  What he said was, I have proudly affirmed that the Mexican nation extends beyond the territory enclosed by its borders, and that Mexican migrants are important, a very important part of it.
[02:27:05.155 --> 02:27:10.738]  He was speaking to the National Council of La Raza of 5000, financed by the Ford Foundation.
[02:27:10.858 --> 02:27:12.338]  Got a huge standing ovation.
[02:27:12.759 --> 02:27:15.480]  If you listen to the entire speech, what it was in essence,
[02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:19.221]  We're going to take over all the political institutions of California.
[02:27:19.321 --> 02:27:23.642]  In five years, the Hispanics are going to be the majority population of this state.
[02:27:23.662 --> 02:27:24.822]  You also made the statement
[02:27:40.253 --> 02:27:44.759]  I didn't know that we were, Glenn, Glenn, I didn't know that we were racial states.
[02:27:56.002 --> 02:27:57.183]  Well, we certainly are now.
[02:27:57.383 --> 02:28:02.986]  And Mario Oblado, if you knew him, uses Hispanic and Mexican interchangeably.
[02:28:03.526 --> 02:28:07.709]  So what he was essentially saying is California is going to be a Mexican state.
[02:28:08.189 --> 02:28:09.850]  Anyone who doesn't like it should leave.
[02:28:09.890 --> 02:28:11.151]  They should go back to Europe.
[02:28:11.531 --> 02:28:13.492]  He was the co-founder of MALDEF.
[02:28:14.193 --> 02:28:21.218]  He was the co-founder of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the winner of the 1998 Presidential Medal of Freedom.
[02:28:21.538 --> 02:28:22.679]  I'm going to tell you something.
[02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:32.687]  If any leading person, other than a person of color or other ethnicity, had said anything close to that, they would be driven out of society.
[02:28:32.887 --> 02:28:34.248]  Let me stop you for a second, Glenn.
[02:28:34.788 --> 02:28:36.549]  Jason, I was asking you to hold.
[02:28:36.569 --> 02:28:38.431]  I want to keep a line open for Jason.
[02:28:39.153 --> 02:28:40.134]  I think we're good to go.
[02:29:03.090 --> 02:29:04.392]  Bring you back up to the airwaves.
[02:29:04.432 --> 02:29:04.772]  Go ahead.
[02:29:04.792 --> 02:29:05.393]  You got the floor.
[02:29:05.713 --> 02:29:10.758]  Okay, I was just saying, why not go to the source of the problem?
[02:29:11.198 --> 02:29:17.505]  Why majority congressmen and Republicans, Democrats, I don't know, not doing anything about it.
[02:29:18.291 --> 02:29:21.495]  If they were serious, like I said, why not put a wall?
[02:29:21.916 --> 02:29:24.058]  You're absolutely right, Jason.
[02:29:24.118 --> 02:29:24.899]  You are on target.
[02:29:24.919 --> 02:29:26.481]  That's what Glenn was saying last hour.
[02:29:26.782 --> 02:29:32.268]  So what I'm saying is his own white people are hurting their own white people.
[02:29:32.549 --> 02:29:32.849]  That's it.
[02:29:32.869 --> 02:29:33.490]  They're evil.
[02:29:33.550 --> 02:29:43.355]  The people running the Ford Foundation and Bush and the rest of them want low wages, want a giant third world mass, want us all dumbed down with no sovereignty.
[02:29:43.395 --> 02:29:48.238]  That's the UN goal, sacrificing America on the altar of globalism.
[02:29:48.298 --> 02:29:54.702]  Well, what it is, Alex, is that the United States government does not admit how much they really rely and depend on the Mexican workers.
[02:29:55.342 --> 02:29:56.143]  That's nonsense.
[02:29:56.683 --> 02:29:57.403]  Oh, come on.
[02:29:57.603 --> 02:29:59.785]  It is complete and total nonsense.
[02:30:00.165 --> 02:30:02.226]  I've studied labor economics...
[02:30:02.706 --> 02:30:04.568]  A degree in mathematical statistics.
[02:30:04.628 --> 02:30:05.650]  I've studied this issue.
[02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:07.151]  It is nonsense.
[02:30:07.552 --> 02:30:09.514]  No, because no one else will work for cheaper.
[02:30:09.554 --> 02:30:10.015]  Yeah, right.
[02:30:10.035 --> 02:30:10.976]  Well, of course they won't.
[02:30:11.256 --> 02:30:12.197]  It's not nonsense.
[02:30:12.237 --> 02:30:12.978]  Let me stop you.
[02:30:12.998 --> 02:30:13.979]  Let me stop you, Glenn.
[02:30:14.099 --> 02:30:14.820]  Everybody stop.
[02:30:14.900 --> 02:30:15.521]  Everybody stop.
[02:30:15.561 --> 02:30:17.083]  Let me just break this down for you, Jason.
[02:30:17.523 --> 02:30:18.724]  Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex,
[02:30:45.855 --> 02:30:47.676]  Alex, may I say something?
[02:30:47.816 --> 02:30:48.256]  Go ahead.
[02:30:48.476 --> 02:30:52.577]  I had a letter published to the Arizona Star News to the following effect.
[02:30:53.017 --> 02:31:00.279]  A guy had written a letter, rather a column, that if we've gotten rid of all the illegal aliens, lettuce would cost $5 a head.
[02:31:00.959 --> 02:31:01.839]  I did the work.
[02:31:01.999 --> 02:31:02.800]  I did the math.
[02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:04.320]  I did the analysis.
[02:31:04.840 --> 02:31:15.215]  At that time, and today too, for lettuce to cost $5 a head, we would have to pay the field workers $235 an hour.
[02:31:15.695 --> 02:31:16.076]  Okay?
[02:31:16.436 --> 02:31:18.259]  That's how crazy that stuff is.
[02:31:18.279 --> 02:31:21.143]  If you understood anything about labor economics,
[02:31:21.443 --> 02:31:28.689]  You know, you wouldn't even see the change in price of produce if you had to pay these people twice what they were earning.
[02:31:28.929 --> 02:31:30.210]  The problem is not that.
[02:31:30.530 --> 02:31:39.217]  It's that these farmers and anybody else who works in a commodity or a competitive environment has to hire the illegals because they work on such small margins.
[02:31:39.558 --> 02:31:41.859]  And if his competitor doesn't, he has to do it.
[02:31:41.999 --> 02:31:42.660]  Let me stop you.
[02:31:42.680 --> 02:31:43.100]  Let me stop you.
[02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:44.161]  And whose fault is that?
[02:31:44.181 --> 02:31:45.082]  Whose fault is that?
[02:31:49.305 --> 02:31:50.586]  It's the fault of our government.
[02:31:51.146 --> 02:31:52.927]  Okay, so why not go to the source?
[02:31:53.127 --> 02:31:58.851]  Jason, Jason, and Glenn, we're not blaming black people, white people, Hispanics.
[02:31:58.931 --> 02:32:05.575]  We always go back to Hispanics because that's the 400 million people south of the border coming this way.
[02:32:05.995 --> 02:32:08.097]  And I've been... Let me stop you, Jason.
[02:32:08.137 --> 02:32:09.377]  Have you been to Mexico City?
[02:32:10.178 --> 02:32:10.478]  No, sir.
[02:32:11.033 --> 02:32:12.674]  They'll work for nothing, Bill Alex Jones.
[02:32:33.436 --> 02:32:35.197]  They'll be more than what they're making there.
[02:32:35.578 --> 02:32:37.859]  And I'm saying it's the government's fault.
[02:32:38.620 --> 02:32:40.441]  That's the way they take care of their people, okay?
[02:32:40.802 --> 02:32:41.482]  I agree with you.
[02:32:41.522 --> 02:32:44.525]  I don't take any of this to heart because it's no different.
[02:32:44.565 --> 02:32:49.488]  If Russia was our border or Germany, everyone would be wanting to get rid of the Germans and Russians.
[02:32:49.508 --> 02:32:50.189]  That is correct.
[02:32:50.769 --> 02:32:51.090]  Okay?
[02:32:51.310 --> 02:32:52.471]  The point is this.
[02:32:52.891 --> 02:32:54.532]  Mexico is a corrupt nation.
[02:32:54.953 --> 02:32:56.934]  We shouldn't have gone over and beat up Iraq.
[02:32:57.374 --> 02:33:01.598]  We should have gone down there and beat up that corrupt government of Mexico.
[02:33:01.618 --> 02:33:02.819]  Please turn the radio off, Jason.
[02:33:04.392 --> 02:33:05.974]  Jason, turn your radio off, please.
[02:33:06.034 --> 02:33:06.874]  It was out of control.
[02:33:07.855 --> 02:33:09.637]  Okay, final comments from Glenn Spencer.
[02:33:09.677 --> 02:33:12.099]  Final comments on this issue from Jason.
[02:33:12.359 --> 02:33:13.581]  Jason, you've got 60 seconds.
[02:33:14.001 --> 02:33:19.266]  Okay, I just say go ahead and target the people who are not doing anything to stop the border crossing.
[02:33:19.526 --> 02:33:20.627]  It's not only Mexicans.
[02:33:20.767 --> 02:33:23.970]  It's Russians, Afghanistan people, all kinds of people.
[02:33:24.291 --> 02:33:28.755]  Oh, it's thousands a month in Cochise County of illegal Muslims.
[02:33:28.955 --> 02:33:30.036]  Glenn, tell them all about that.
[02:33:30.496 --> 02:33:37.520]  We've got a lot of Muslims coming across, carrying Mexican ID cards, by the way, and lots of people from Brazil.
[02:33:37.540 --> 02:33:39.481]  They're coming up through Panama.
[02:33:39.561 --> 02:33:41.282]  Chinese are coming up through Panama.
[02:33:42.163 --> 02:33:46.745]  There is no question that unless we get control of this border, we will become a third world country.
[02:33:47.085 --> 02:33:48.926]  But we also need to help Mexico.
[02:33:49.887 --> 02:33:55.070]  Mr. Spencer, I don't want you to think, though, that the Mexicans have just been coming here.
[02:33:55.526 --> 02:33:58.728]  You know, Hispanic people have been here, and in California, forever.
[02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:01.490]  They were never there.
[02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:04.591]  This doesn't happen to know what they're talking about.
[02:34:04.611 --> 02:34:11.656]  Those are hunter-gatherer Indians in Southern California, mostly the Gabriela Indians.
[02:34:11.936 --> 02:34:15.258]  They were agricultural people.
[02:34:15.278 --> 02:34:17.719]  They had nothing to do with the people in California.
[02:34:17.759 --> 02:34:18.920]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:34:20.931 --> 02:34:24.953]  He's talking about Southern California, and Jason's talking about Tejano's.
[02:34:25.613 --> 02:34:26.853]  Now, let me just say something here.
[02:34:27.374 --> 02:34:28.214]  Let me just say something here.
[02:34:28.334 --> 02:34:30.835]  Glenn's talking about who has the claim to the land.
[02:34:30.875 --> 02:34:37.698]  If anybody is, it's Shoshone, it's Comanche, it's Apache, it's all these groups.
[02:34:37.778 --> 02:34:39.799]  And for Metro to claim the Aztecs.
[02:34:40.859 --> 02:34:45.941]  I know something about land because the King of Spain, he granted my grandfather what is the Kennedy Ranch.
[02:34:46.756 --> 02:34:49.337]  And my grandfather, he lent it out eventually.
[02:34:49.377 --> 02:34:52.198]  And as time went on, he let the people use the land.
[02:34:52.238 --> 02:34:53.138]  And they kept on coming.
[02:34:53.418 --> 02:34:54.359]  They took all his land.
[02:34:54.399 --> 02:34:55.339]  And, sir, that's true.
[02:34:55.879 --> 02:34:57.740]  And, you know, that's just the way it was.
[02:34:57.860 --> 02:34:58.200]  No, no.
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:06.523]  In Texas, and this has been pointed out by Pat Buchanan, too, that the two cultures get along a lot better.
[02:35:06.543 --> 02:35:07.383]  That's what Tejano is.
[02:35:07.403 --> 02:35:09.344]  That's correct.
[02:35:09.844 --> 02:35:14.846]  I mean, you know, I mean, also, I have blonde-haired, blue-eyed cousins that are Hispanics.
[02:35:15.407 --> 02:35:20.810]  You know, we're just not brown, dark people who just... Yeah, well, just look at Spanish-language television.
[02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:23.772]  Look at Spanish-language television.
[02:35:23.952 --> 02:35:25.052]  I don't watch it, man.
[02:35:25.152 --> 02:35:27.914]  I was never... I always thought English was my first language.
[02:35:28.134 --> 02:35:29.955]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call, Jason.
[02:35:29.995 --> 02:35:30.375]  Thank you.
[02:35:31.256 --> 02:35:33.557]  Look, I've just got to say this here and now.
[02:35:34.057 --> 02:35:35.738]  You see what the media's done here.
[02:35:35.878 --> 02:35:36.979]  You see what's happened.
[02:35:37.719 --> 02:35:43.962]  We're not saying if you're Hispanic you should go back to Mexico because we know you could be from anywhere.
[02:35:43.982 --> 02:35:44.723]  Absolutely.
[02:35:44.763 --> 02:35:48.085]  Probably been here longer than Glenn Spencer and Alex Jones' family have been.
[02:35:48.565 --> 02:35:52.207]  But my family got their land in a Spanish land grant in 1830 just like Jason's.
[02:35:52.687 --> 02:35:57.690]  The point I'm trying to make here is that the Spanish...
[02:35:58.710 --> 02:36:02.394]  And part of that is in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
[02:36:20.393 --> 02:36:21.133]  Yeah, they say it.
[02:36:21.213 --> 02:36:27.716]  I mean, they went to the folks in Kentucky and in Tennessee and said, we know you've got a lot of guns and you're real mean.
[02:36:27.996 --> 02:36:35.759]  And a lot of Texas, remember, a big part of Texas was acquired from France in the Louisiana Purchase and then swapped over in Spain for Florida.
[02:36:35.899 --> 02:36:37.720]  There was a lot of land swapping going on.
[02:36:37.740 --> 02:36:42.001]  If anybody's got claims to land, I have a lot of Indian friends, the Indians do.
[02:36:42.061 --> 02:36:44.442]  And if the Indians want some more land, I think it's fine.
[02:36:44.722 --> 02:36:48.664]  But this discussion that it belongs to Mexico is a fraud, correct?
[02:36:48.684 --> 02:36:49.104]  That's correct.
[02:36:51.081 --> 02:36:53.302]  I mean, again, my family didn't get their land from Mexico.
[02:36:53.322 --> 02:36:54.342]  They got it from Spain.
[02:36:55.363 --> 02:36:55.583]  Okay?
[02:36:55.603 --> 02:36:57.543]  It was empires fighting with each other.
[02:36:59.364 --> 02:37:00.465]  But absolutely.
[02:37:00.765 --> 02:37:06.247]  I mean, and people who are Hispanic and are American citizens have just as much a right as I do to be here.
[02:37:06.307 --> 02:37:06.747]  Absolutely.
[02:37:06.907 --> 02:37:08.688]  Whether you're black or white, it doesn't matter.
[02:37:09.148 --> 02:37:12.109]  I've been on the radio a lot, and I've had these guys call in.
[02:37:12.449 --> 02:37:16.210]  But at the last minute, they'll just slide this little thing as, well, it's really our land anyway.
[02:37:16.591 --> 02:37:20.372]  And that gets my back up because that just isn't true.
[02:37:21.546 --> 02:37:23.747]  And so I react pretty strongly when I hear that.
[02:37:24.107 --> 02:37:27.647]  Oh, that was really nice and reasonable, but oh, remember, this is really our land.
[02:37:27.667 --> 02:37:28.208]  Well, it isn't.
[02:37:28.688 --> 02:37:30.008]  Especially Southern California.
[02:37:30.348 --> 02:37:31.768]  Especially this part of Arizona.
[02:37:31.788 --> 02:37:34.409]  This was purchased in the Gadsden Purchase.
[02:37:34.649 --> 02:37:37.550]  So where I am, it wasn't even part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
[02:37:37.570 --> 02:37:38.370]  Well, wait, Glenn.
[02:37:38.410 --> 02:37:43.391]  Glenn, there weren't giant crystal pyramids with flying saucers run by the Aztecs?
[02:37:43.891 --> 02:37:44.091]  Right.
[02:37:44.531 --> 02:37:47.592]  Well, that's what the Mecha says that.
[02:37:47.752 --> 02:37:47.992]  Yeah, well,
[02:37:48.152 --> 02:37:51.274]  The one land that they claim more than anything else is California.
[02:37:51.674 --> 02:37:52.894]  That's where they're really invading.
[02:37:53.115 --> 02:37:57.096]  But they say... The Mexicans had nothing to do with the Indians of California.
[02:37:57.117 --> 02:37:58.037]  It was a severe desert.
[02:37:58.297 --> 02:38:03.360]  On Metra's own website, they claim that there were large crystal pyramids with flying saucers.
[02:38:03.700 --> 02:38:03.940]  Right.
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:05.681]  So why don't we just believe that?
[02:38:06.021 --> 02:38:08.022]  Right.
[02:38:08.162 --> 02:38:12.024]  It's all a sham, and the American people have bought it hook, line, and sinker.
[02:38:12.714 --> 02:38:13.594]  And they better wake up.
[02:38:13.634 --> 02:38:16.095]  But I have faith in the masses, the wisdom of the masses.
[02:38:16.135 --> 02:38:18.356]  I believe they'll eventually catch up.
[02:38:19.196 --> 02:38:19.796]  It takes time.
[02:38:19.816 --> 02:38:21.797]  All right, two quick calls real quick.
[02:38:21.857 --> 02:38:24.337]  Brad in Illinois, then Warren in Colorado, and that's it.
[02:38:24.477 --> 02:38:25.618]  Appreciate all of Glenn's time.
[02:38:25.638 --> 02:38:26.418]  Go ahead, Brad.
[02:38:27.998 --> 02:38:34.400]  Yeah, unfortunately, the land belongs to the person or the people who have title to it.
[02:38:34.460 --> 02:38:37.061]  Unfortunately, nobody has any title to any land anymore.
[02:38:37.890 --> 02:38:39.151]  We're good to go.
[02:38:56.292 --> 02:39:05.939]  And they get a job, and they're turned in, and they're illegal, and the corporation or the business or the people they're working for pays the fine and pays to deport them back and pays for everything.
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:09.282]  Felony charges for anybody hiring illegals.
[02:39:09.502 --> 02:39:10.203]  Absolutely.
[02:39:10.743 --> 02:39:16.087]  And before you can immigrate to this country, it should be the way it was before 1950.
[02:39:17.028 --> 02:39:18.529]  They had to have a sponsor.
[02:39:18.869 --> 02:39:22.590]  The sponsor would pay to have that relative or friend come to this country.
[02:39:22.891 --> 02:39:24.671]  The sponsor would vouch for them.
[02:39:24.971 --> 02:39:30.053]  And if they got in trouble, the person would either, the immigrant would either go to jail, get deported, and guess what?
[02:39:30.353 --> 02:39:33.454]  The person that vouched for them would also get the same job.
[02:39:33.495 --> 02:39:36.416]  They wrote the law in 1996 to do just that.
[02:39:36.756 --> 02:39:37.796]  And it's not enforced.
[02:39:37.876 --> 02:39:40.957]  And the reason it's not enforced is that you have people like Dr. Robert Bach.
[02:39:43.178 --> 02:39:43.779]  We're good to go.
[02:39:54.326 --> 02:40:06.011]  They also, and a group sworn to destroy America, they also, when they would come here, whether you were German or Mexican or Ethiopian, you had to learn the Bill of Rights and Constitution so you knew your rights.
[02:40:06.351 --> 02:40:07.672]  That doesn't happen anymore.
[02:40:08.032 --> 02:40:12.213]  And also, we should have, this country is an English-speaking country.
[02:40:12.413 --> 02:40:12.594]  Right.
[02:40:12.654 --> 02:40:15.835]  I don't care what color you are, where you come from.
[02:40:16.675 --> 02:40:25.422]  It's common sense that you have to have a common language amongst the people living in a country in order to develop and have commerce.
[02:40:25.582 --> 02:40:33.389]  Plus English is the world language now, and you are hurting somebody by encouraging them not to learn that dominant language.
[02:40:33.449 --> 02:40:39.233]  They want to keep them in the barrios under their local barrio chief's control, under the government's control.
[02:40:39.313 --> 02:40:44.617]  It's about importing slaves and keeping them slaved and enslaving everybody else.
[02:40:44.657 --> 02:40:45.238]  Glenn, do you agree?
[02:40:45.858 --> 02:40:46.339]  Totally.
[02:40:46.559 --> 02:40:48.040]  And it is greed.
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:53.163]  It is all of the elements of human behavior all wrapped up into one.
[02:40:53.203 --> 02:40:54.063]  It's conquest.
[02:40:54.144 --> 02:40:55.204]  It's irredentism.
[02:40:55.604 --> 02:40:56.845]  It's la reconquista.
[02:40:56.905 --> 02:40:57.686]  It's profit.
[02:40:58.266 --> 02:40:58.907]  It's fear.
[02:40:59.727 --> 02:41:03.590]  It's all of these things wrapped up into what can be called a disaster.
[02:41:03.650 --> 02:41:04.610]  Let me give you an example.
[02:41:04.650 --> 02:41:08.833]  A former city council candidate... Thanks for the call, Brad.
[02:41:10.350 --> 02:41:11.871]  Got caught shipping in illegals.
[02:41:11.911 --> 02:41:12.771]  Guess how he got caught?
[02:41:12.791 --> 02:41:15.253]  He was beating one of their brains out with a baseball bat.
[02:41:15.293 --> 02:41:16.674]  He's one of the Brown Beret guys.
[02:41:17.454 --> 02:41:22.337]  So they're the ones feeding on their own people, and it's sick and it's disgusting, but it's about illegals, period.
[02:41:22.697 --> 02:41:24.038]  AmericanPatrol.com.
[02:41:24.078 --> 02:41:26.920]  Glenn Spencer, thanks for all the time, and Godspeed to you, my friend.
[02:41:26.940 --> 02:41:27.400]  Thank you, Glenn.
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:28.641]  Hope people support you.
[02:41:28.901 --> 02:41:30.162]  I'll be back in the final segment.
[02:41:30.202 --> 02:41:32.643]  I'll tell you about satellite tracking and trolling your cars.
[02:41:32.943 --> 02:41:33.984]  New information on that.
[02:41:37.498 --> 02:41:37.838]  We're good to go.
[02:41:37.858 --> 02:41:38.119]  I think?
[02:42:01.937 --> 02:42:02.798]  We're good to go.

[02:42:32.567 --> 02:42:33.969]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:42:36.653 --> 02:42:39.538]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:42:40.237 --> 02:42:41.518]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:42:41.738 --> 02:42:47.481]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.

[02:43:01.668 --> 02:43:06.310]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:43:06.390 --> 02:43:06.610]  Troops
[02:43:06.630 --> 02:43:07.270]  It's on the streets.
[02:43:07.410 --> 02:43:09.151]  Foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:43:09.451 --> 02:43:12.631]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[02:43:12.691 --> 02:43:14.552]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:27.680]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:44:39.389 --> 02:44:39.889]  Don't worry.
[02:44:40.349 --> 02:44:41.869]  This show is documented.
[02:44:42.390 --> 02:44:45.170]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:45.290 --> 02:44:51.851]  Folks, the UN has said they want to dumb your kids down.
[02:44:51.891 --> 02:44:53.712]  The UN has said they want to get rid of your borders.
[02:44:54.112 --> 02:44:56.272]  And our government's just carrying that policy out.
[02:44:58.052 --> 02:45:01.993]  And people are getting wise to this, regardless of what color they are, that it's destroying our country.
[02:45:02.033 --> 02:45:05.154]  Real quick, Warren in Colorado, you're the last caller of the day.
[02:45:05.174 --> 02:45:06.054]  Then I've got to hit some news.
[02:45:06.094 --> 02:45:06.774]  Go ahead, Warren.
[02:45:06.794 --> 02:45:07.254]  You're on the air.
[02:45:07.774 --> 02:45:08.574]  Okay, real quick.
[02:45:08.714 --> 02:45:19.019]  It's been kind of hard to keep up today, but this basically is America, and we have the Constitution, and it's real basic.
[02:45:19.679 --> 02:45:27.283]  If people are going to be here, no matter if they're Mexican or whatever, we've got to stick to that.
[02:45:28.374 --> 02:45:31.056]  I had quite a few other good points I thought I'd make.
[02:45:31.076 --> 02:45:32.376]  Well, yeah, I want to make that point.
[02:45:32.396 --> 02:45:36.159]  They're not teaching immigrants anymore mellow rights or Constitution.
[02:45:36.179 --> 02:45:37.960]  They're robbing them of that.
[02:45:38.020 --> 02:45:39.741]  That's the whole point of this.
[02:45:39.781 --> 02:45:40.201]  Go ahead.
[02:45:40.741 --> 02:45:41.422]  Oh, yeah.
[02:45:41.742 --> 02:45:52.408]  You know, I've had to teach my own children what the Constitution means and what's going on as far as that is concerned about freedom and so on and
[02:45:53.457 --> 02:45:54.518]  And that's about it.
[02:45:54.638 --> 02:45:56.480]  I don't want to take up any more of the time.
[02:45:56.660 --> 02:45:57.641]  Well, thank you, Warren.
[02:45:57.881 --> 02:46:01.905]  I mean, look, an illegal doesn't have to have an ID card, but you as a citizen do.
[02:46:02.645 --> 02:46:10.292]  Whether you're black or white or Hispanic or green, you go and fight in these wars and pay all these taxes and do all this, and the illegals don't have to.
[02:46:11.713 --> 02:46:14.055]  And when the illegals do pay taxes, they don't even get any of the money.
[02:46:14.075 --> 02:46:15.817]  Of course, who wants it from this government?
[02:46:15.857 --> 02:46:16.817]  It's all just a big scam.
[02:46:16.857 --> 02:46:18.179]  It's bad for the illegals.
[02:46:18.559 --> 02:46:19.580]  It's bad for the citizens.
[02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:20.681]  It's good for the bankers.
[02:46:22.105 --> 02:46:23.687]  We fight corruption here, folks.
[02:46:24.808 --> 02:46:25.648]  Look at Australia.
[02:46:25.688 --> 02:46:42.504]  They've opened the borders, bringing in the illegals, making them legal, take the guns, and now unlimited power of arrest to ASIO, Australia's domestic intelligence agency, ASIO, will have aggressive new powers from today to detain, for an unlimited period, citizens suspected of having information about terrorist offenses.
[02:46:43.766 --> 02:46:46.168]  And it lists that terrorist offenses are any violation of law.
[02:46:46.208 --> 02:46:47.349]  Same thing as the Patriot Act.
[02:46:47.893 --> 02:46:50.634]  And it says they will secretly arrest you and you'll never be seen again.
[02:46:51.234 --> 02:46:52.275]  It says that in the article.
[02:46:52.555 --> 02:46:54.376]  Members of the press can be secretly arrested.
[02:46:54.416 --> 02:46:54.956]  Did you know that?
[02:46:55.236 --> 02:46:57.097]  For reporting things they weren't supposed to.
[02:46:57.397 --> 02:46:58.637]  Oh, that sounds like freedom.
[02:47:01.118 --> 02:47:02.379]  It just gets worse and worse.
[02:47:02.419 --> 02:47:07.821]  And now Paul Wolfowitz, the demon of the Defense Department, is going to run the military tribunals.
[02:47:07.861 --> 02:47:09.922]  Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on Thursday.
[02:47:11.249 --> 02:47:11.949]  We're good to go.
[02:47:33.143 --> 02:47:35.525]  Look at this article out of the Associated Press.
[02:47:35.545 --> 02:47:37.406]  You've got to go read it on InfoWars.com.
[02:47:37.426 --> 02:47:41.628]  They just calmly announced in the article that the government's going to take physical control of your car.
[02:47:42.849 --> 02:47:45.811]  I told you, not just satellite tracking and taxation.
[02:47:46.291 --> 02:47:48.813]  Smart cars, smart roads can help drivers.
[02:47:49.293 --> 02:47:57.178]  And it says if you don't follow the warnings on the bleeping system that tracks you, the little flashing lights, they're going to physically take control of your car.
[02:47:58.010 --> 02:48:00.691]  This is by Leslie Miller, Associated Press writer.
[02:48:00.871 --> 02:48:05.673]  Smart cars, smart roads can help drivers enforce within five years AP.
[02:48:06.053 --> 02:48:16.617]  I mean, folks, massive big brother, total enslavement of citizens, illegals going around with no IDs, double the welfare citizens get, laughing at us regardless of where they're from.
[02:48:17.077 --> 02:48:20.198]  This isn't right, but the globalists have done this before.
[02:48:20.579 --> 02:48:22.099]  They want to destroy America.
[02:48:22.399 --> 02:48:24.320]  They're going to bring in the illegals to do it.
[02:48:25.174 --> 02:48:28.497]  And then the illegals are saying, oh, well, this is Mexico or this is Russia.
[02:48:28.797 --> 02:48:30.519]  Great, we'll be like Mexico or Russia.
[02:48:32.180 --> 02:48:32.781]  It's incredible.
[02:48:32.801 --> 02:48:35.843]  You know, to get away from this tyranny, I might go to Latin America.
[02:48:38.005 --> 02:48:43.450]  You know, it isn't that I want to be around people that are one color or another.
[02:48:43.490 --> 02:48:45.391]  It's that I don't want to be in a country destroyed.
[02:48:45.452 --> 02:48:45.812]  That's it.
[02:48:47.299 --> 02:48:47.979]  I'm out of time.
