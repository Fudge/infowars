[00:00:03.777 --> 00:00:07.038]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.179]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:16.879]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:18.720]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.180]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.820]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.161]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:30.802]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:31.982]  Yeah, good.
[00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:34.828]  Alex Jones, I'm Michael Corbin.
[00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:39.336]  Alex is away on business and will be back and return to the airwaves on Thursday.
[00:00:39.877 --> 00:00:41.680]  We've got quite a lineup for you today, so...
[00:00:43.658 --> 00:00:44.799]  We're good to go.
[00:01:05.013 --> 00:01:20.209]  Basically, what the Schindler family saga is about is a woman lies in a state of coma in the hospital in Florida, and the courts are attempting to have her tube removed, which would essentially cause her to die.
[00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:21.749]  It's quite a story.
[00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:53.439]  It kind of reflects the attitude and the mindset of the people that are running this country today.
[00:01:53.459 --> 00:02:01.685]  Who would have ever thought that the government would have the authority to decide whether you live or die?
[00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:10.332]  But of course, as this plan to take control of all of our lives, as it continues to unfold, that is their goal.
[00:02:10.372 --> 00:02:11.252]  That's one of their goals.
[00:02:12.313 --> 00:02:14.455]  One of the things you really need to be aware of is that
[00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:40.380]  For example, Terry Schiavo, who is the person that is lying this whole thing with the courts, the only reason that they want to disconnect her tube and cause her to die is because she's made herself vulnerable because of a $750,000 medical fund that she acquired via a medical malpractice lawsuit payable to her inheritor when she dies.
[00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.070]  So, the inheritor is her husband.
[00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:55.358]  So, essentially, her husband is capable of making the choices to do this, and the government is more than willing to step up to the plate and end this woman's life.
[00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:58.660]  I think it's absolutely ridiculous, and we're going to talk about that.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.404]  Then, coming up at the top of the second hour, we're going to be joined by Paul... Let me get to his name here.
[00:03:04.964 --> 00:03:05.584]  Paul Watson.
[00:03:05.604 --> 00:03:05.685]  Paul...
[00:03:08.095 --> 00:03:08.836]  We're good to go.
[00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:10.837]  We're good to go.
[00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:27.109]  We're good to go.
[00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.469]  I think?
[00:03:49.527 --> 00:03:58.815]  We're going to find out today when we talk to him how both the Clinton and Bush administrations protected Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda network before September the 11th.
[00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.838]  We're also going to find out about the highest levels of the U.S.
[00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:05.941]  government were complicit in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
[00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:10.505]  Many of the named 9-11 suicide hijackers are still alive.
[00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:14.407]  And the real culprits have never been officially identified.
[00:04:14.447 --> 00:04:15.107]  That's interesting.
[00:04:15.768 --> 00:04:22.050]  British MI5 has infiltrated the IRA, and they're carrying out terrorist attacks to maintain a divided Ireland.
[00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:30.113]  We're also going to hear from him on chaos mongers who are arming tyrants worldwide as a pretext for endless war and empire building.
[00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:34.415]  And, of course, this is something that has been demonstrated numerous times in the mainstream press.
[00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:35.797]  I think we're good to go.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.243]  We're going to come to all of that coming back from the break, and we'll get to that, too.
[00:04:55.884 --> 00:04:57.145]  You're going to like that story about Arnold.
[00:04:57.185 --> 00:05:01.268]  And, of course, we're going to be joined at some point today by Alex Jones, who is going to give us a special report.
[00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:02.148]  Stay tuned.
[00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:03.589]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.670]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.848 --> 00:05:18.236]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:23.242]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:23.482 --> 00:05:29.129]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.891]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:34.092 --> 00:05:41.255]  The casual society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:45.818]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:48.519]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:55.423]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:05:55.663 --> 00:06:00.929]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.350]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:11.986]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:12.567]  Pollution.
[00:06:12.607 --> 00:06:12.907]  Pollen.
[00:06:12.927 --> 00:06:14.067]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:14.508]  Allergies.
[00:06:14.648 --> 00:06:14.928]  Asthma.
[00:06:14.968 --> 00:06:15.548]  Probably not.
[00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:16.409]  Well, listen to this.
[00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:25.633]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[00:06:25.693 --> 00:06:26.514]  Six to ten times?
[00:06:26.554 --> 00:06:27.634]  How can that be, you ask?
[00:06:27.694 --> 00:06:27.954]  Worse.
[00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:29.375]  Think about what's inside your home.
[00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:30.216]  Hairspray.
[00:06:30.316 --> 00:06:30.836]  Chemicals.
[00:06:31.116 --> 00:06:31.836]  Does anyone smoke?
[00:06:31.856 --> 00:06:32.117]  Fumes.
[00:06:32.237 --> 00:06:33.938]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:06:34.378 --> 00:06:35.939]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:36.719]  Toxic fumes.
[00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.160]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.780]  You're so fake.
[00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:42.626]  Am I scaring you?
[00:06:42.946 --> 00:06:43.847]  Remember this word.
[00:06:44.247 --> 00:06:44.987]  Puritech.
[00:06:45.027 --> 00:06:46.548]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[00:06:46.608 --> 00:06:48.789]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[00:06:48.969 --> 00:07:01.496]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[00:07:01.616 --> 00:07:02.877]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[00:07:02.897 --> 00:07:02.957]  888-491-4100.
[00:07:02.997 --> 00:07:04.278]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:07.959]  We're good to go.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.040]  We're good to go.
[00:07:35.854 --> 00:07:41.197]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:07:41.357 --> 00:07:45.119]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.341]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:49.562]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:07:49.822 --> 00:07:54.405]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:07:54.445 --> 00:08:00.348]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.377]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:08:10.951 --> 00:08:16.596]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:20.460]  And returning today, sitting in for Alex is Michael Corbin.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.400]  I'm here with Michael Corbin.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.262]  And Alex is away on business.
[00:08:23.282 --> 00:08:24.823]  He will return on Thursday.
[00:08:25.184 --> 00:08:26.485]  I'll be with you tomorrow as well.
[00:08:26.985 --> 00:08:30.528]  And we're going to cover some very interesting topics between now and tomorrow.
[00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:37.815]  And, of course, when Alex returns, he will also continue bringing you breaking news and keeping you abreast of what's going on.
[00:08:38.459 --> 00:08:45.161]  Now, as I mentioned, we're going to have Pamela Hennessey join us at the bottom of the hour to talk about the case of Terry Schiavo.
[00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:47.521]  And that's going to be very interesting.
[00:08:47.741 --> 00:08:54.423]  And also, some of the things that are happening in the news today that you can find on www.infowars.com.
[00:08:54.443 --> 00:08:57.444]  We're going to cover some of those real quick before we get to our guest.
[00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:04.947]  We're going to open up the lines as well to you, so you can call in at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:05.447 --> 00:09:06.627]  Again, that number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:12.770]  And you can go ahead and start calling now if you'd like.
[00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:16.972]  Coming off of the Infowars.com site, there was an interesting story today.
[00:09:17.272 --> 00:09:19.333]  There's actually several interesting stories, but the one that...
[00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:29.619]  Particularly I found interesting is Israel has gotten the green light from George Bush to strike Syria's terrorist base.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:46.293]  Now, this is kind of an interesting article because this comes off of the AP, but essentially what's going on here is that the Israeli warplanes attacked an Islamic jihad training base deep in Syria for retaliation in a suicide bombing at a Haifa restaurant that killed 19 people.
[00:09:47.446 --> 00:09:52.771]  Now, Israeli media said that it was the first Israeli attack on Syrian soil in more than two decades.
[00:09:53.492 --> 00:10:03.442]  The strike, which occurred late Saturday or early Sunday, targeted the Ein Shah Saheb camp about 10 miles northwest of Damascus, and that was according to Israeli officials.
[00:10:04.082 --> 00:10:10.889]  The base was being used by several terrorist organizations, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the army statement said.
[00:10:11.423 --> 00:10:19.632]  Now, Syria has been warned more than once by the United States that it should close all of the facilities of the Islamic Jihad.
[00:10:20.313 --> 00:10:29.243]  Apparently it has not done so, and it is their policy, the Israelis' policy, after what happened in Haifa, to go after Islamic Jihad wherever they are.
[00:10:29.263 --> 00:10:32.567]  Well, the Syrian government has made no immediate response.
[00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:43.092]  Now, speaking on the Al Jazeera television network, Abu Imad al-Rafai, an Islamic Jihad spokesman in Beirut, Lebanon, he denied that there were any Islamic Jihad bases in Syria.
[00:10:43.692 --> 00:10:55.318]  Now, the interesting thing is that on April the 16th, 2001, Israeli warplanes blasted a Syrian radar station in Lebanon where Syria is the main power broker, killing three Syrian soldiers.
[00:10:55.979 --> 00:10:56.499]  We're good to go.
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:31.890]  Because when you get right down to it, our government, in conjunction with the Israeli government, desires to control the oil.
[00:11:33.812 --> 00:11:42.261]  Oil is one of those things that every nation in the world, no matter where you are, every nation in the world requires some form or derivative of oil.
[00:11:43.772 --> 00:11:56.854]  And when you're talking about the New World Order and the people that are trying to take control of everything, it stands to reason that you would want to control one of the most important items on the planet, and that is oil.
[00:11:57.702 --> 00:11:58.162]  We're good to go.
[00:11:58.182 --> 00:11:58.382]  I think?
[00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:32.445]  But anyway, this is very interesting because, as you know, they will go to any extreme, any length.
[00:12:33.095 --> 00:12:37.456]  To make sure that they get this plan into place.
[00:12:37.516 --> 00:12:43.538]  This article comes from, let's see here, to the news press, published by newspress.com.
[00:12:44.458 --> 00:12:47.039]  And it's security cameras that are watching the Lely School.
[00:12:47.379 --> 00:12:50.480]  This is the first high school in Collier with this system.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.181]  And the article goes on to say that graffiti sprayers, burglars, and other criminals, beware.
[00:12:55.201 --> 00:12:59.222]  Of course, you know, they always preface these kinds of actions with some...
[00:13:00.303 --> 00:13:07.511]  You know, thing that is somewhat justifiable or makes you feel more comfortable with what they're doing.
[00:13:08.474 --> 00:13:11.295]  The article says Big Brother is watching you at Lely High School.
[00:13:11.715 --> 00:13:17.556]  He's also watching students moving from class to class, eating in the cafeteria, and hanging out in the courtyards.
[00:13:18.317 --> 00:13:25.598]  The school just became the first in Collier County to install security cameras in hallways, the cafeteria, courtyards, and around the outside of the school.
[00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:31.600]  The system with 30 cameras cost $40,000, but school officials say it's worth it.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.563]  Yes, I am enthusiastic about the cameras, said Ed Messer, manager for district safety and security.
[00:13:38.043 --> 00:13:41.285]  He says it's not a privacy issue anymore, it's a safety issue.
[00:13:42.145 --> 00:13:42.505]  Of course.
[00:13:43.606 --> 00:13:45.027]  Safety.
[00:13:45.187 --> 00:13:46.888]  We can provide safety for you.
[00:13:47.488 --> 00:13:48.368]  No longer about privacy.
[00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:51.630]  Schools that are safer are smarter, and that's our job.
[00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:52.991]  Again, that's a load.
[00:13:53.887 --> 00:13:59.631]  Bob Friedland, assistant principal at Lely High School, can sit in his office and see what is happening all over his school.
[00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:04.875]  Now, from his computer, he can zoom the cameras in and out, pan and tilt, and record the video.
[00:14:05.215 --> 00:14:09.378]  Top school officials at the district level can do the same from the administration building.
[00:14:09.838 --> 00:14:16.343]  There's also another article on InfoWars.com that says, spying on your teens via satellite for $600.
[00:14:16.423 --> 00:14:18.504]  Now, this is an interesting concept.
[00:14:20.347 --> 00:14:20.847]  We're good to go.
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:15:00.390]  Australian company Internav's mobile phone-sized global positioning system tracking device has emergency alarm button and software so parents can zoom in on a child's whereabouts using a home computer.
[00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.291]  Now, this device is going to cost $895.
[00:15:02.952 --> 00:15:08.136]  Again, these are examples of how silly things are getting.
[00:15:09.737 --> 00:15:11.599]  The other thing we're looking at, too, is...
[00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:13.540]  Skull and Bones.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.743]  Now, there was a recent program on 60 Minutes about the Skull and Bones.
[00:15:17.823 --> 00:15:19.904]  Alexander Robbins, I believe, was featured on that.
[00:15:20.865 --> 00:15:31.232]  The Skull and Bones, as many of you probably know, is the Yale secret society that our president and his father and a lot of other social engineers have belonged to.
[00:15:31.812 --> 00:15:38.537]  A lot of people suspect or believe that the Skull and Bones is like the center of the onion in some ways.
[00:15:39.337 --> 00:15:40.438]  I think we're good to go.
[00:15:40.518 --> 00:15:41.319]  I think we're good to go.
[00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:08.860]  The suicide webcast was killed.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:18.603]  Okay, the webcast of a concert by a Florida band, Hell on Earth, that was supposed to occur this past Friday night and feature a live suicide did not happen.
[00:16:19.363 --> 00:16:27.205]  And kind of along that same line, kind of illustrating how Hollywood is warping the minds of your children, there's a new movie out called Kill Bill.
[00:16:27.626 --> 00:16:32.107]  Quentin Tarantino has been pushing the extreme violence to 12-year-old kids.
[00:16:32.887 --> 00:16:34.968]  And this is sick.
[00:16:35.623 --> 00:16:36.264]  It's very sick.
[00:16:37.385 --> 00:16:50.015]  The film is Tarantino's first major film since Jackie Brown six years ago, and it tells the story of an elite assassin played by Uma Thurman, who is on a mission of revenge against her former employer Bill, played by David Carradine.
[00:16:50.436 --> 00:16:56.181]  Now, Kill Bill is reported to be extremely gory, even for Tarantino, well-known for his violent gangster flicks,
[00:16:57.141 --> 00:17:03.466]  Such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, as well as the shock horror vampire movie From Dusk Till Dawn.
[00:17:03.866 --> 00:17:19.277]  At a press conference before the London premiere on Thursday, Tarantino said that over 100 gallons of fake blood had been used for the movie and described how one fight scene in which Thurman dismembers 88 opponents with a Japanese sword took over eight weeks to shoot.
[00:17:20.463 --> 00:17:28.528]  She says, or Tarantino said that he wanted to think of every way he could for her to disband and put an end to her enemies.
[00:17:29.249 --> 00:17:35.873]  The director went on to talk about a gang rape scene in the movie, which he said was a sequence of hell of which he was very proud.
[00:17:36.614 --> 00:17:45.219]  Seated next to Thurman and other stars in the film, Daryl Hannah and Julie Dreyfuss, Tarantino said Kill Bill was a feminist statement, a film about girl power.
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:46.820]  Oh, God.
[00:17:47.543 --> 00:17:51.525]  Thurman also told journalists that her favorite scenes were when she used her sword.
[00:17:51.925 --> 00:17:54.386]  She says, I'm a very possessive person of my sword.
[00:17:54.726 --> 00:17:59.788]  She became one with it, she earned it, and she has to learn the hard way how to handle that thing.
[00:18:00.348 --> 00:18:04.430]  Well, Kill Bill is in two installments with a second volume expected to be released next year.
[00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:11.672]  Again, this is an example of how Hollywood really got their sights set.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.601]  There's a dynamic here.
[00:18:18.082 --> 00:18:22.666]  When they use violence, oftentimes they use sex and violence together.
[00:18:23.587 --> 00:18:26.771]  People wonder why no one has any respect for women.
[00:18:27.692 --> 00:18:32.136]  They wonder how come our children have a confusion about their sexuality.
[00:18:32.497 --> 00:18:36.301]  And not only that, what's expected of them as boys and girls or as men and women...
[00:18:36.921 --> 00:18:37.061]  I think.
[00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:12.415]  And that's something that parents have a responsibility to make sure that their kids are not filling their minds.
[00:19:12.435 --> 00:19:14.497]  I mean, you put garbage in, you're going to get garbage out.
[00:19:15.097 --> 00:19:17.860]  And Hollywood has taken a tremendous role.
[00:19:18.642 --> 00:19:23.164]  And facilitating the deconstruction of your minds.
[00:19:23.224 --> 00:19:24.945]  Not just kids, but also adults as well.
[00:19:25.525 --> 00:19:27.066]  This is just another example of this.
[00:19:27.506 --> 00:19:28.746]  Anyway, our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:28.766 --> 00:19:28.826]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:28.846 --> 00:19:30.447]  Also, I want to invite you to visit my website.
[00:19:30.467 --> 00:19:33.929]  I'm the host of A Closer Look on Saturday nights carried on GCN's radio network.
[00:19:42.697 --> 00:19:46.243]  And it's at www.4acloserlook.com.
[00:19:46.263 --> 00:19:49.107]  That's the number 4, acloserlook.com.
[00:19:49.608 --> 00:19:53.734]  And I'd like to have you join me on Saturday night, 6 to 8 Mountain, 8 to 10 Eastern.
[00:19:54.075 --> 00:19:54.355]  Stay tuned.
[00:19:54.375 --> 00:19:55.837]  There's more to come on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:55.877 --> 00:19:56.539]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[00:19:56.819 --> 00:19:57.420]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:11.656 --> 00:20:17.604]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:20:17.825 --> 00:20:20.088]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:20:20.268 --> 00:20:26.637]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver, 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:20:26.957 --> 00:20:27.618]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.515 --> 00:20:43.415]  We're good to go.
[00:20:43.435 --> 00:20:43.935]  We're good to go.
[00:21:09.198 --> 00:21:10.799]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:16.904]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:17.164 --> 00:21:22.288]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:22.649 --> 00:21:31.916]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:21:32.276 --> 00:21:37.219]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:41.561]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:21:41.761 --> 00:21:46.524]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:21:46.884 --> 00:21:52.787]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:21:53.147 --> 00:21:53.588]  We're good to go.
[00:21:53.608 --> 00:21:54.209]  We're good to go.
[00:22:09.122 --> 00:22:10.362]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks
[00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:39.132]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:39.152 --> 00:22:39.472]  Thank you.
[00:23:08.571 --> 00:23:10.872]  Hi, my name is Donald from thegoldenanswer.com.
[00:23:11.192 --> 00:23:13.352]  Everyone knows that they need to own gold and silver.
[00:23:13.552 --> 00:23:14.873]  You see the headlines every day.
[00:23:15.133 --> 00:23:17.553]  It's the only safe haven in these turbulent times.
[00:23:17.873 --> 00:23:20.394]  Many of you want to acquire gold, but you can't afford it.
[00:23:20.554 --> 00:23:25.755]  Thegoldenanswer.com is a private club, and our members acquire gold at 40 cents on the dollar.
[00:23:25.935 --> 00:23:27.916]  That's right, just 40 cents on the dollar.
[00:23:28.176 --> 00:23:31.797]  Our layaway leverage plan will help you stockpile real wealth.
[00:23:32.117 --> 00:23:34.360]  Now obviously there's a catch, but we believe in you.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.403]  We believe in your desire to be secure.
[00:23:36.603 --> 00:23:38.205]  We believe in your desire to be free.
[00:23:38.506 --> 00:23:39.427]  Our plan is simple.
[00:23:39.747 --> 00:23:44.393]  Only our club members can open a layaway contract by putting down a 40% deposit.
[00:23:44.513 --> 00:23:48.779]  The balance is paid off by getting five other people into the club and to open a contract.
[00:23:49.059 --> 00:23:50.259]  We are the answer.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:55.301]  The golden answer to securing your future in gold and silver bullion at 40 cents on the dollar.

[00:23:59.663 --> 00:23:59.883]  That's 1-800-710-1090.
[00:23:59.923 --> 00:24:02.944]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:16.681 --> 00:24:19.027]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:21.012 --> 00:24:24.219]  And indeed there is a war on for your mind, pocketbook.com.
[00:24:24.913 --> 00:24:31.360]  On your children's minds, every little facet of your life they want control of, they want to know what you think.
[00:24:32.441 --> 00:24:33.503]  We're going to continue the fight.
[00:24:33.523 --> 00:24:34.143]  1-800-259-9231 is our number.
[00:24:34.163 --> 00:24:34.223]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:34.243 --> 00:24:36.466]  I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones, who will be back on Thursday.
[00:24:36.486 --> 00:24:37.347]  And Alex is away on a...
[00:24:47.498 --> 00:24:50.301]  Business, and he will be giving us a special report.
[00:24:50.321 --> 00:24:51.863]  We're supposed to get one today from him as well.
[00:24:51.883 --> 00:24:59.531]  He's out in California and taking that business out there with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:24:59.572 --> 00:25:03.916]  Also, like I said, we're going to hear from Greg Pallast during the third hour, who is...
[00:25:05.191 --> 00:25:11.854]  Greg has dug into some interesting things and has come up with Arnold's Enron secret, and that's going to be very interesting.
[00:25:12.314 --> 00:25:16.736]  That's a $9 billion secret that he has, and there's a lot at stake, of course.
[00:25:16.756 --> 00:25:18.077]  $9 billion is a lot of money.
[00:25:18.658 --> 00:25:23.481]  But anyway, coming up, as I mentioned earlier, at the bottom of the hour, we're going to be joined by Pamela Hennessey.
[00:25:23.901 --> 00:25:30.325]  I want to read to you real quick a letter from Terry Schiavo's father, who has appealed.
[00:25:30.745 --> 00:25:33.767]  He's gotten injunctions to stop the feeding tube from being removed.
[00:25:34.427 --> 00:25:37.869]  Judge Greer in Florida has ruled three separate times to have it removed.
[00:25:38.609 --> 00:25:39.530]  It was clamped once.
[00:25:40.086 --> 00:25:41.067]  We're good to go.
[00:25:41.087 --> 00:25:42.007]  We're good to go.
[00:26:00.771 --> 00:26:04.172]  Judge Greer's verdict will cause Terry to die in 10 to 14 days.
[00:26:04.612 --> 00:26:05.852]  Terry will die of starvation.
[00:26:05.952 --> 00:26:10.613]  As I mentioned, this is an older letter, but the substance of what we are going to be talking about is contained in this.
[00:26:11.193 --> 00:26:22.036]  Now, as Terry's father, I have been designated as spokesperson for the family and, more important, as a voice for Terry appealing to you to join us in our efforts to reverse this travesty of justice.
[00:26:22.556 --> 00:26:23.976]  We have to save Terry's life.
[00:26:24.576 --> 00:26:26.797]  Essentially, Terry has been sentenced to death.
[00:26:27.395 --> 00:26:32.560]  We do not understand how in a civilized society that Terry's life was even put on trial.
[00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:35.463]  Terry has not committed a felony or any crime.
[00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:36.570]  We're good to go.
[00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.810]  I think?
[00:26:58.809 --> 00:27:03.433]  Now, the precedence that Terry's trial and ensuing verdict establishes should frighten everyone.
[00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:10.098]  Basically, any person that is impaired, who cannot speak their mind, is vulnerable to be legally executed.
[00:27:10.878 --> 00:27:15.102]  In Terry's case, where money is the motivation, the risk increases substantially.
[00:27:15.622 --> 00:27:24.689]  This ruling could potentially open the door to eventually include everyone who is a burden to his or her caretaker or a drain on the state.
[00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.571]  This is what this is really all about.
[00:27:26.591 --> 00:27:27.931]  The frustration must be unbearable.
[00:27:55.842 --> 00:27:58.246]  Now, Terry's trial has attracted national media coverage.
[00:27:58.626 --> 00:28:01.330]  People have responded from across the country offering their support.
[00:28:01.731 --> 00:28:07.139]  There have been communications from people who also have family members impaired by brain damage and have recovered.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.606]  They relate scenarios where their family member was in the identical situation as Terry.
[00:28:12.146 --> 00:28:12.746]  We're good to go.
[00:28:34.656 --> 00:28:35.136]  We're good to go.
[00:28:54.924 --> 00:28:56.265]  There is hope for Terry to recover.
[00:28:56.325 --> 00:29:00.108]  She displays the exact characteristics as described by all the callers.
[00:29:00.588 --> 00:29:05.892]  Her husband does not want anyone to believe that Terry is a living human being who consistently responds when stimulated.
[00:29:06.312 --> 00:29:11.016]  He is well aware that he has denied Terry any opportunity to recover for the past 11 years.
[00:29:11.616 --> 00:29:17.140]  Before we can concentrate on assisting Terry's recovery, the immediate priority is to stop Terry's execution.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.881]  We have to keep Terry alive.
[00:29:19.242 --> 00:29:21.083]  We are dedicated to preserve Terry's life.
[00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:24.984]  Terry does not deserve to have her precious life cut short.
[00:29:25.644 --> 00:29:26.485]  Please help us.
[00:29:27.085 --> 00:29:28.126]  We cannot do this alone.
[00:29:28.747 --> 00:29:32.069]  Please join our family and make this a community effort to overturn this cruel verdict.
[00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:35.853]  We must challenge this miscarriage of justice, and indeed, we must.
[00:29:36.133 --> 00:29:39.135]  And we are going to talk about it coming up next with Pamela Hennessey.
[00:29:39.415 --> 00:29:41.137]  There's a lot more to come on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:41.157 --> 00:29:44.199]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:44.219 --> 00:29:46.521]  I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:47.522]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.575 --> 00:30:01.477]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.958 --> 00:30:03.561]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:07.207]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.493 --> 00:30:11.254]  Oh my God!
[00:30:11.514 --> 00:30:16.240]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.201]  Yes, it's true.
[00:30:17.281 --> 00:30:19.964]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:30:20.104 --> 00:30:21.465]  Our doctors are prescribing them... 321-1900.
[00:30:21.505 --> 00:30:28.033]  Tell them John sent you and put an end to your energy crisis with Be Alive Royal Jelly.
[00:30:28.053 --> 00:30:28.093]  866-321-1900.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.781]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.982]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:30:44.002 --> 00:30:47.384]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway.
[00:30:47.664 --> 00:30:50.405]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[00:30:50.725 --> 00:30:52.826]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me.
[00:30:53.026 --> 00:30:55.287]  I know I'm working for the state.
[00:30:55.307 --> 00:30:56.667]  I'm the highway patrol.
[00:30:56.687 --> 00:30:58.968]  Whoa, yeah!
[00:30:59.648 --> 00:31:01.589]  Yeah, well, not in Alex Jones' territory, you're not.
[00:31:02.398 --> 00:31:03.038]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:31:03.278 --> 00:31:10.861]  Filling in for Alex today, I'm Michael Corbin, host of A Closer Looker.
[00:31:10.941 --> 00:31:16.543]  Saturday evenings on the GCN Radio Network, 6 to 8 Mountain, 8 to 10 p.m.
[00:31:16.723 --> 00:31:17.063]  Eastern.
[00:31:17.103 --> 00:31:21.105]  And I want to encourage you to join my program as well on Saturday nights.
[00:31:21.645 --> 00:31:39.129]  Now, before I get to my guest, Pamela Hennessey, to talk about this really heart-rending story about Terry Schiavo, I want to mention to you that the most important thing that you can do to combat what is taking place in our culture or our society is to be informed.
[00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:43.030]  An informed citizenry is a prepared citizenry.
[00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:46.811]  And Alex has taken great pains to construct...
[00:31:47.244 --> 00:31:47.724]  We're good to go.
[00:32:16.153 --> 00:32:20.076]  The more informed we are, the better prepared we are to deal with whatever comes down the pike.
[00:32:20.577 --> 00:32:26.381]  Now, videos that Alex has produced, the most current one is Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:32:26.842 --> 00:32:30.905]  This is the greatest evil that mankind has ever faced, and it is among us.
[00:32:31.005 --> 00:32:33.307]  It's a scientifically crafted global dictatorship.
[00:32:33.867 --> 00:32:34.248]  We're good to go.
[00:32:54.927 --> 00:33:05.517]  He's also produced the 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 2000, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and his book, of course, is 9-11, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:33:05.837 --> 00:33:09.941]  Now, you can get these videos for $25.95 plus shipping and handling.
[00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:12.583]  If you order three or more, the price goes down to $20 a tape.
[00:33:13.684 --> 00:33:14.784]  Plus shipping and handling.
[00:33:15.044 --> 00:33:16.305]  There's two ways you can get these.
[00:33:17.025 --> 00:33:19.246]  The first is by calling Alex's toll-free number at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:33:19.266 --> 00:33:20.286]  Again, that number is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:33:20.346 --> 00:33:25.088]  His website also offers these books, the book and the videotapes, at www.infowars.com or www.prisonplanet.com.
[00:33:25.228 --> 00:33:28.209]  I encourage you to go there, order information,
[00:33:41.673 --> 00:33:43.676]  Get informed and stay informed, okay?
[00:33:44.276 --> 00:33:46.499]  Now, before we go to Pamela Hennessy, let's take a quick call.
[00:33:46.539 --> 00:33:49.803]  We've got Paul calling in from New Jersey.
[00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:51.325]  Good morning, good afternoon, Paul.
[00:33:51.345 --> 00:33:51.786]  You're on the air.
[00:33:51.806 --> 00:33:52.707]  Hi, Michael.
[00:33:53.167 --> 00:34:01.117]  I just wanted to say that I don't believe there's any correlation that's really been proven between movie violence and real violence in a nation.
[00:34:01.929 --> 00:34:07.135]  I disagree with that because there has been a considerable amount of study on that.
[00:34:07.915 --> 00:34:10.038]  I refer to Judith Reisman.
[00:34:10.939 --> 00:34:13.842]  I don't know if Alex has had her on the program, but I've interviewed her.
[00:34:14.442 --> 00:34:21.390]  She has spent a considerable amount of her life documenting the correlation between not only the...
[00:34:23.268 --> 00:34:23.348]  Yeah.
[00:34:23.388 --> 00:34:23.508]  Mm-hmm.
[00:34:49.813 --> 00:34:52.774]  So I would contend for most people and most kids,
[00:35:13.257 --> 00:35:15.198]  ...to watch a violent movie.
[00:35:15.598 --> 00:35:20.181]  They're generally not going to commit acts of violence, and I don't think that happens frequently at all.
[00:35:20.521 --> 00:35:21.882]  You know, Paul, I would say this.
[00:35:21.902 --> 00:35:33.529]  I think the concern is legitimate, but I think the existing laws that restrict kids from seeing rated-R movies are adequate, and I do believe that adults have the right to see violent movies.
[00:35:33.849 --> 00:35:36.451]  Well, sure, you do, but here's the thing.
[00:35:36.871 --> 00:35:39.613]  I would also concede that there may not be a direct...
[00:35:40.157 --> 00:35:40.737]  Correlation.
[00:35:41.237 --> 00:35:49.520]  But I think that the important factor to keep in mind is that when people watch extreme graphic violence, it does a couple of things.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:36:07.145]  Number one, it desensitizes them to violence, and it makes them more susceptible, I would think, to becoming violently oriented to where violence would be an option in whatever practical life activities they might engage in.
[00:36:07.885 --> 00:36:08.765]  I appreciate your call.
[00:36:08.805 --> 00:36:09.506]  Thank you very much.
[00:36:09.746 --> 00:36:11.406]  We're going to move on to our guest, Pamela Hennessey.
[00:36:12.687 --> 00:36:14.067]  And thank you very much again, Paul.
[00:36:14.627 --> 00:36:21.130]  Okay, now, Pamela Hennessey is the volunteer media coordinator for the Schindler family.
[00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:28.472]  And I'm going to bring her on and have her discuss this quite heart-wrenching story about Terry Schiavo.
[00:36:28.952 --> 00:36:31.013]  And without further ado, good morning, Pamela.
[00:36:31.033 --> 00:36:31.473]  You're on with me.
[00:36:32.173 --> 00:36:32.693]  Hi there.
[00:36:32.773 --> 00:36:33.454]  How are you, Michael?
[00:36:33.654 --> 00:36:34.294]  I'm doing good.
[00:36:35.015 --> 00:36:35.275]  Good.
[00:36:35.595 --> 00:36:40.718]  I read the letter from Terry's father, which was very touching.
[00:36:40.878 --> 00:36:42.319]  And, you know, this is quite a story.
[00:36:42.739 --> 00:36:43.920]  Give us a little background on this.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.621]  What happened to Terry and what's going on right now with her?
[00:36:47.182 --> 00:36:49.463]  Okay, there's quite a bit going on at the moment.
[00:36:50.204 --> 00:36:54.526]  The thumbnail of the case is in 1990, Terry collapsed.
[00:36:54.646 --> 00:36:55.907]  He suffered a cardiac arrest.
[00:36:57.394 --> 00:36:58.976]  The cause of which is still unknown.
[00:37:00.157 --> 00:37:02.939]  Some media reports she had a heart attack, but that's not true.
[00:37:04.481 --> 00:37:16.911]  In any event, during this collapse of this medical incident, oxygen was cut off to her brain for several minutes, and because of that, she suffered profound cognitive disability.
[00:37:18.813 --> 00:37:23.577]  At that stage, Terry's husband, Michael Chivo...
[00:37:24.452 --> 00:37:26.374]  He filed a medical malpractice suit.
[00:37:26.394 --> 00:37:28.075]  He asked for $20 million.
[00:37:28.335 --> 00:37:32.779]  He said he expected his wife to live 50 or more years.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.544]  The jury awarded him just over $1.5 million.
[00:37:39.645 --> 00:37:45.630]  And as soon as he had the money in the bank, he entered a do-not-resuscitate order into Terry's chart.
[00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:48.873]  He ceased any aggressive therapy for her.
[00:37:48.953 --> 00:37:50.974]  He's not given her therapy in over 11 years.
[00:37:52.632 --> 00:37:57.893]  And he petitioned the courts in 1998 to remove Terry's gastric tube.
[00:37:58.173 --> 00:38:12.556]  Now, Terry receives nutrition and hydration via a G-tube, and removing that tube will cause her to die of dehydration and starvation over the course of 10 to 14 days.
[00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:14.676]  Pamela, let me ask you this.
[00:38:14.716 --> 00:38:16.777]  Did I inaccurately report that she's in a coma?
[00:38:16.817 --> 00:38:17.957]  Is she in a coma, or is she...
[00:38:19.243 --> 00:38:20.084]  Is she awake?
[00:38:20.825 --> 00:38:21.905]  She's definitely awake.
[00:38:24.787 --> 00:38:29.211]  Terry has, you know, she has periods of sleeping and wakefulness.
[00:38:29.831 --> 00:38:31.092]  She has a vocabulary.
[00:38:31.572 --> 00:38:34.755]  She says things like mommy and help me and pain.
[00:38:34.775 --> 00:38:41.940]  She's actually very, very much aware.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.743]  The courts have found her to be in a persistent vegetative state, but there are 14 doctors
[00:38:48.564 --> 00:38:59.887]  On record now, and under penalty of perjury, who say she is not, persistent vegetative state, or PVS, is misdiagnosed 43% of the time.
[00:38:59.907 --> 00:39:01.947]  Sure, yeah.
[00:39:02.047 --> 00:39:10.969]  So she's definitely very aware, but she does have profound brain damage, and she's not been given therapy or rehabilitation, so she's not...
[00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:15.342]  But she's still a living human being, which is the most important paramount fact here.
[00:39:15.362 --> 00:39:16.003]  Absolutely.
[00:39:16.023 --> 00:39:16.944]  She's a living human being.
[00:39:17.344 --> 00:39:18.485]  Yes, she certainly is.
[00:39:18.765 --> 00:39:30.935]  And the problem with this particular court case and what has gone on in Judge Greer's court, Florida has a very solid definition of what PZS is.
[00:39:31.656 --> 00:39:38.782]  And that is somebody who is completely unaware of their environment and completely unable to interact.
[00:39:39.656 --> 00:39:40.757]  Well, Terry does interact.
[00:39:41.217 --> 00:39:42.958]  You know, she tries to speak.
[00:39:43.058 --> 00:39:44.479]  She follows commands.
[00:39:45.639 --> 00:40:03.550]  And the danger part in all of this is that video evidence was submitted into the court, and Judge Greer and doctors appointed by the husband in this case, the husband who wants Terry dead, said, well, you know, she's doing something, but it's not very consistent.
[00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.893]  So they're kind of lowering the bar for people who are disabled.
[00:40:09.628 --> 00:40:10.829]  Pamela, let me ask you this.
[00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:14.170]  The reason I want to ask you this is because I'm going in a direction with this.
[00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:18.372]  I think the audience should understand a couple of elements here.
[00:40:18.952 --> 00:40:20.733]  How did you get involved with this kind of a case?
[00:40:22.854 --> 00:40:28.277]  I actually, I had read about Terry's case in the newspapers for a couple of years.
[00:40:29.277 --> 00:40:35.320]  And what I read, I always heard that she was comatose, she was hopeless, she was a vegetable.
[00:40:36.338 --> 00:40:44.382]  And then one day I heard on talk radio, I heard a host talking about the case, saying that she was not.
[00:40:44.802 --> 00:40:53.547]  So I went to the website, I read the court documents, I saw photographs of her, and what I saw horrified me.
[00:40:54.668 --> 00:41:01.111]  And so I got involved immediately and offered my help to the family to get the word out there that
[00:41:02.037 --> 00:41:06.122]  Unfortunately, what's been reported in the media is just not correct.
[00:41:06.742 --> 00:41:11.228]  What I'm amazed at in our culture today is the, you know, this is a culture of death.
[00:41:11.248 --> 00:41:12.449]  That's correct.
[00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:18.936]  It's been described that way by religious leaders, and you know, the whole thing is basically about death.
[00:41:18.996 --> 00:41:20.298]  I mean, that's all there is to it.
[00:41:21.209 --> 00:41:40.062]  Myself, personally, I take compassion like you do with the idea that I don't think under any circumstance the government or any person has the right to decide whether a person who's disadvantaged incredibly in the state, to decide for that person whether that person should live or die.
[00:41:40.922 --> 00:41:42.363]  Well, I agree with you 100%.
[00:41:42.403 --> 00:41:46.686]  And it's funny that you opened this segment today
[00:41:47.446 --> 00:41:47.766]  Right.
[00:41:47.807 --> 00:41:48.027]  Sure.
[00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:17.494]  ...is a movement that I truly believe is afoot in this country and other countries to solve profound medical challenges by causing someone to die.
[00:42:17.754 --> 00:42:23.536]  Yeah, and this is happening in the Nordic countries.
[00:42:23.596 --> 00:42:26.217]  I mean, they already have euthanasia.
[00:42:26.237 --> 00:42:33.540]  And the problem is that although they give you the hype that it's very controlled, it's state-controlled, it's very controlled...
[00:42:35.129 --> 00:42:43.492]  The fact of the matter is that now it's becoming too convenient for the doctors and the medical people to just, you know, go ahead and do it.
[00:42:43.973 --> 00:42:45.813]  Well, that's part of the problem.
[00:42:46.794 --> 00:42:50.215]  And a doctor, a physician, takes a Hippocratic Oath.
[00:42:50.635 --> 00:42:56.317]  And one of the first and most important points of that Hippocratic Oath is that they will do no harm.
[00:42:56.577 --> 00:42:56.958]  That's right.
[00:42:57.198 --> 00:43:00.659]  And in a case like Terry Shivo...
[00:43:01.474 --> 00:43:07.036]  This is not allowing a terminally ill patient who would die naturally anyway.
[00:43:07.757 --> 00:43:14.780]  It's not a case of a patient like that denying medical treatment.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.900]  I mean, what we're talking about is food and water.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.721]  And Terry's not terminal.
[00:43:19.081 --> 00:43:22.783]  So that certainly is part of the problem.
[00:43:23.803 --> 00:43:25.124]  Another thing to consider...
[00:43:26.232 --> 00:43:34.174]  During the year 1938 to 1939, the Third Reich initiated the T4 euthanasia program.
[00:43:34.254 --> 00:43:34.594]  Right.
[00:43:34.894 --> 00:43:42.917]  And they started off with profoundly disabled and handicapped and mentally impaired children.
[00:43:43.397 --> 00:43:47.418]  And then it got a little easier to lower the bar, and a little bit easier to lower the bar.
[00:43:47.438 --> 00:43:48.098]  Precisely.
[00:43:48.438 --> 00:43:55.380]  And a lot of very important historians believe that that was sort of a stepping stone into what happened, into the Holocaust.
[00:43:56.007 --> 00:44:08.118]  You know, that's an interesting thing you brought up because one of the things that I believe personally is that once, and this even kind of reflects back on the call that we had just a minute ago with Paul about violence and that type of thing.
[00:44:08.639 --> 00:44:14.504]  I think once you get to a point where you're so desensitized to the dignity and the value of human life,
[00:44:15.496 --> 00:44:20.680]  It just becomes easy to justify this action and that action.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:38.251]  We analyze the activities of global elites that are enslaving the planet with these crazy notions, and they're actually the purveyors of the culture of death, I believe, because their whole goal is to control and manage the population.
[00:44:38.271 --> 00:44:39.332]  They don't want too many of us.
[00:44:39.592 --> 00:44:41.073]  They don't want us to think for ourselves.
[00:44:41.433 --> 00:44:42.294]  They want to make decisions.
[00:44:42.974 --> 00:44:46.757]  I was asked personally to give a no resuscitation order on my grandmother.
[00:45:05.151 --> 00:45:06.413]  And I refused to do it.
[00:45:06.493 --> 00:45:09.017]  And the doctor and the nurse were very indignant about it.
[00:45:09.558 --> 00:45:10.800]  And I was shocked.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.824]  I was in shock when they asked me to make that decision.
[00:45:13.884 --> 00:45:14.906]  And I said, absolutely not.
[00:45:16.637 --> 00:45:18.678]  I hear both sides of the argument.
[00:45:19.278 --> 00:45:28.862]  You were bringing up the Florida legislation to define the permanent vegetative state and all of these different things.
[00:45:29.543 --> 00:45:32.804]  To me, my statement is, I don't care about all that.
[00:45:33.204 --> 00:45:33.984]  That's not important.
[00:45:34.004 --> 00:45:35.605]  What's important is you have a human life here.
[00:45:36.286 --> 00:45:43.629]  That person has as much right to life as anybody else, and no one should have the authority or the ability to make that decision for me.
[00:45:44.029 --> 00:45:45.369]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:45:45.549 --> 00:45:56.173]  And the decision to withhold nutrition and hydration from Terry Shivo is being based on a concept that there is a quality of life, and who...
[00:45:57.026 --> 00:46:00.667]  Seriously, who is to judge what quality of life is?
[00:46:00.687 --> 00:46:06.248]  You know, the argument could easily be made that Terry is never going to run a marathon.
[00:46:06.308 --> 00:46:11.469]  She may never, you know, get a position in Congress.
[00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:18.030]  Well, neither am I. I mean, we're using the wrong things to define what life is.
[00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:20.491]  Life is no longer an awareness.
[00:46:21.515 --> 00:46:22.256]  Thank you.
[00:46:22.276 --> 00:46:22.796]  Thank you.
[00:46:22.936 --> 00:46:23.176]  Thank you.
[00:46:38.837 --> 00:46:38.977]  Right.
[00:46:38.997 --> 00:46:39.097]  Right.
[00:47:03.414 --> 00:47:03.715]  Right.
[00:47:03.735 --> 00:47:04.296]  Right.
[00:47:04.316 --> 00:47:04.436]  Right.
[00:47:18.425 --> 00:47:19.206]  Well, guess what?
[00:47:19.526 --> 00:47:20.947]  They may say, we're not paying anymore.
[00:47:21.267 --> 00:47:21.568]  Yeah.
[00:47:21.628 --> 00:47:24.049]  So they're either going to turn you out to the street or they're going to euthanize you.
[00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:24.910]  Exactly.
[00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:28.813]  And while you're going down that road, you might as well include pharmaceutical companies.
[00:47:28.833 --> 00:47:29.774]  Absolutely.
[00:47:29.834 --> 00:47:31.055]  It's all part of the same beast.
[00:47:31.655 --> 00:47:42.904]  The funny thing on this particular case, well, it's not funny, the peculiar thing on Terry's case, Terry has had all these doctors come forward and offer to treat her, free of charge.
[00:47:43.665 --> 00:47:45.846]  And still the judge has said no.
[00:47:45.866 --> 00:47:45.946]  Yeah.
[00:47:46.966 --> 00:47:52.029]  Somebody can sit back and kind of look at that and say, why are they so eager for this woman to die?
[00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:59.393]  And I think what they're trying to do is sort of lower the bar, make it easier for the next person to go.
[00:47:59.533 --> 00:48:04.876]  And it's important to remember that Florida has got a very high elderly population.
[00:48:04.896 --> 00:48:05.436]  You betcha.
[00:48:06.237 --> 00:48:07.077]  Good many of them.
[00:48:07.378 --> 00:48:08.258]  We're up against a break.
[00:48:08.318 --> 00:48:08.618]  Hold on.
[00:48:08.658 --> 00:48:10.259]  We'll come back after the break and continue this.
[00:48:10.539 --> 00:48:13.321]  You're a very courageous woman, and I applaud you.
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:16.204]  1-800-259-9231 is our number.
[00:48:16.224 --> 00:48:17.646]  We'll be right back with Pamela Hennessey.
[00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:18.327]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[00:48:18.367 --> 00:48:18.688]  Stay tuned.
[00:48:18.708 --> 00:48:20.551]  There's more to come on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:31.511 --> 00:48:32.172]  We're good to go.
[00:48:56.209 --> 00:49:06.673]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:49:06.973 --> 00:49:07.453]  That's right.
[00:49:07.653 --> 00:49:14.756]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:49:15.056 --> 00:49:23.239]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium
[00:49:23.539 --> 00:49:26.562]  At 888-803-4438.
[00:49:26.722 --> 00:49:31.267]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:49:31.647 --> 00:49:35.972]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:49:36.152 --> 00:49:40.577]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:49:40.737 --> 00:49:45.101]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:49:45.161 --> 00:49:46.483]  The New World Order.
[00:49:47.223 --> 00:49:47.584]  Can emerge.
[00:49:48.265 --> 00:49:52.489]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:59.497]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:49:59.617 --> 00:50:01.620]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:12.323]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:50:12.603 --> 00:50:17.984]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:50:18.485 --> 00:50:21.145]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:50:21.245 --> 00:50:22.266]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:50:22.306 --> 00:50:22.486]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:50:22.506 --> 00:50:23.546]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:50:31.048 --> 00:50:31.849]  Oh my God!
[00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:36.832]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:50:37.132 --> 00:50:37.793]  Yes, it's true.
[00:50:37.893 --> 00:50:40.575]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:50:40.715 --> 00:50:44.738]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:50:44.858 --> 00:50:45.398]  You heard it right.
[00:50:45.578 --> 00:50:50.602]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:50:50.742 --> 00:50:52.202]  You may miss out forever.
[00:51:09.167 --> 00:51:09.808]  We're good to go.
[00:51:09.848 --> 00:51:10.368]  We're good to go.
[00:51:39.474 --> 00:51:40.234]  We're good to go.
[00:51:40.314 --> 00:51:46.197]  We're good to go.
[00:51:59.326 --> 00:52:03.249]  Everybody in the audience should take up the cause that Pamela is fighting for.
[00:52:03.669 --> 00:52:12.695]  They should contact the governor's office in Florida, Jeb Bush, who has, Terry will report here, filed a motion in court.
[00:52:12.715 --> 00:52:13.776]  I'll have her describe it.
[00:52:14.276 --> 00:52:23.802]  I would encourage everyone to let the governor of Florida know that we will not tolerate state-sponsored executions of this nature.
[00:52:24.423 --> 00:52:25.904]  Pamela, what has Jeb Bush done recently?
[00:52:26.871 --> 00:52:32.075]  Well, as of today, Mr. Bush has filed an amicus brief into the case.
[00:52:32.155 --> 00:52:39.099]  Now, there's not a lot there that I can really comment about without being an attorney, but your listeners can.
[00:52:39.539 --> 00:52:41.060]  It is a public record.
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.101]  It is a court document.
[00:52:42.841 --> 00:52:52.748]  And they can view that on our updates if they go to Terry's website, and that is TerrysFight.org, T-E-R-R-I-F-Fight.org.
[00:52:53.994 --> 00:52:56.335]  And that's been posted as of today.
[00:52:56.355 --> 00:53:04.599]  So if they want to read that, and unfortunately, as I said, since I'm not an attorney, they're going to have to form their own opinion on it.
[00:53:04.919 --> 00:53:06.840]  But that was filed as of today.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.541]  What do you encourage people to do?
[00:53:09.561 --> 00:53:15.943]  Should we tell them to contact the governor's office in Florida to let them know that they're not going to tolerate this?
[00:53:15.983 --> 00:53:17.344]  Do you not want to see this happen?
[00:53:17.784 --> 00:53:20.846]  Well, they can do that, and that is an important thing to do.
[00:53:20.866 --> 00:53:20.926]  But...
[00:53:22.401 --> 00:53:51.595]  One thing that I would like to say to your listeners that they really should do, you know, we're talking about this culture of death, and I think over the past 20 or so years, you know, attorneys have tried to encourage their clients through family law to have an advance directive or a living will or some other medical proxy that should they become incapacitated, what they will and will not accept as medical treatment,
[00:53:52.871 --> 00:54:02.899]  Your listeners need to re-examine the documents that they have governing their health care, and they should also seek out a life support directive.
[00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:14.327]  Now, the reason I say that is because, like Florida, a lot of states are adapting statutes that say food and water is life support, which is ridiculous.
[00:54:15.228 --> 00:54:16.629]  You and I need food and water.
[00:54:16.649 --> 00:54:17.650]  Right.
[00:54:18.593 --> 00:54:33.403]  So I would say to your listeners that they really need to examine that and talk to their attorneys, talk to their spouses and to their children about what their precise wishes are and make sure that it does get into writing.
[00:54:35.084 --> 00:54:37.966]  Terry had no living will and no advance directive.
[00:54:38.107 --> 00:54:44.291]  Her husband testified in court, you know, she told me back in the 80s she wouldn't want to be on life support.
[00:54:44.811 --> 00:54:45.772]  Well, that was before...
[00:54:47.051 --> 00:54:50.892]  The Florida statutes change to include food and water as life support.
[00:54:50.912 --> 00:54:53.492]  So there could be no way she addressed that.
[00:54:53.772 --> 00:54:55.573]  Pamela, real quick, about a minute.
[00:54:55.933 --> 00:54:57.353]  Where's her husband in all of this right now?
[00:54:57.373 --> 00:54:58.433]  Is he fighting you folks?
[00:54:59.654 --> 00:54:59.854]  No.
[00:54:59.934 --> 00:55:06.795]  Well, he's fighting in the court for the right to have her gastric tube clamped off and to allow her to die.
[00:55:06.815 --> 00:55:10.276]  And that's a process that can take 10 to 14 days, and she will suffer.
[00:55:10.296 --> 00:55:13.337]  And he has pursued this.
[00:55:13.417 --> 00:55:15.557]  A lot of people ask, why doesn't he get a divorce?
[00:55:16.865 --> 00:55:18.286]  And that remains a mystery.
[00:55:18.586 --> 00:55:18.746]  Yeah.
[00:55:19.226 --> 00:55:20.387]  Well, we're out of time, Pamela.
[00:55:20.467 --> 00:55:21.167]  Thank you very much.
[00:55:21.387 --> 00:55:22.008]  You're a good woman.
[00:55:22.048 --> 00:55:22.508]  Keep it up.
[00:55:22.588 --> 00:55:25.009]  I mean, I know what you must be going through.
[00:55:25.209 --> 00:55:28.111]  It's got to be very, very hard dealing with the system in this way.
[00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:34.272]  You know, I just hope that it all pans out best.
[00:55:34.572 --> 00:55:36.714]  Well, I do as well, and thank you for having us on.
[00:55:36.995 --> 00:55:38.056]  Okay, thank you very much.
[00:55:38.136 --> 00:55:38.856]  You take care, okay?
[00:55:39.137 --> 00:55:39.497]  You too.
[00:55:39.517 --> 00:55:39.937]  Thank you.
[00:55:39.957 --> 00:55:40.338]  God bless.
[00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:42.420]  Okay, that's it for this hour.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.120]  Stay tuned.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:46.003]  There's more coming up on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:55:46.043 --> 00:55:46.704]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:55:46.724 --> 00:55:46.784]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:55:46.844 --> 00:55:48.345]  Be sure and visit the website.
[00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:57.394]  For Terry Schiavo, www.terrysfight.org.
[00:55:57.434 --> 00:56:01.779]  That's T-E-R-R-I-S-FIGHT.O-R-G.
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.342]  Don't let this one go down in flames, okay?
[00:56:05.043 --> 00:56:05.663]  There's more to come.
[00:56:05.683 --> 00:56:06.164]  Stay tuned.
[00:56:06.464 --> 00:56:08.887]  Paul Joseph Watson will be joining me at the top of the hour.
[00:56:08.927 --> 00:56:09.868]  We'll be right back after this.
[00:56:21.727 --> 00:56:22.987]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:23.067 --> 00:56:24.148]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:56:50.576 --> 00:56:51.676]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.337 --> 00:56:53.157]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.917 --> 00:56:54.857]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.877 --> 00:56:59.138]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.659 --> 00:57:03.780]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.800]  And again, sitting in for Alex is my Michael Corbin.
[00:57:07.261 --> 00:57:08.641]  Alex will return on Thursday.
[00:57:08.661 --> 00:57:09.901]  I'm going to be with you tomorrow.
[00:57:09.961 --> 00:57:12.142]  And I'm really enjoying this.
[00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:15.183]  And it's an honor that Alex asked me to sit in for him.
[00:57:16.423 --> 00:57:17.183]  Love the audience.
[00:57:17.223 --> 00:57:19.544]  A very fine audience and a very fine program.
[00:57:20.231 --> 00:57:24.153]  Now, as I mentioned, we're going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson here in just a moment.
[00:57:25.093 --> 00:57:29.615]  He wrote a book called Order Out of Chaos, the Elite Sponsored Terrorism and the New World Order.
[00:57:29.635 --> 00:57:41.240]  And this kind of reflects back to yesterday's program when we talked with Paul David Collins about his book, The Hidden Face of Terrorism, and how a lot of terrorism is actually state-sponsored.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.561]  And when you get down to doing the math...
[00:57:43.021 --> 00:57:43.421]  We're good to go.
[00:57:43.441 --> 00:57:43.742]  I think?
[00:58:12.617 --> 00:58:13.257]  We're good to go.
[00:58:13.297 --> 00:58:13.577]  I think?
[00:58:32.581 --> 00:58:38.825]  What that essentially equates to is, you know, just like the thing we were talking about with Pamela Hennessy, there is no dignity of life anymore.
[00:58:38.865 --> 00:58:40.425]  There is no dignity of the individual.
[00:58:40.806 --> 00:58:44.708]  You are nothing more to them than an economic unit of measurement.
[00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:47.689]  And this is precisely what the New World Order is about.
[00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:48.930]  It's an economic world order.
[00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:55.534]  It is nothing more than a bunch of money-grabbing control freaks.
[00:58:56.235 --> 00:58:56.895]  Thank you very much.
[00:59:22.672 --> 00:59:23.192]  We're good to go.
[00:59:23.233 --> 00:59:23.593]  We're good to go.
[00:59:44.187 --> 00:59:49.449]  So that you have nothing at the end of the month, but you've got to keep paying them.
[01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:13.516]  And, you know, it's like a catch-22 and it just keeps on going and it keeps on going.
[01:00:14.558 --> 01:00:15.901]  But anyway, also I want to mention, too,
[01:00:17.501 --> 01:00:19.062]  My program is called A Closer Look.
[01:00:19.562 --> 01:00:23.084]  It's aired on Saturday night on GCN, the GCN radio network.
[01:00:23.504 --> 01:00:39.191]  Of course, GCN, in my estimation, is the world's authority on what's really happening in the world because they have brought together a lot of very, very controversial talk show hosts who are out there doing the work and digging up this stuff and bringing this stuff to you so you can be informed.
[01:00:40.151 --> 01:00:48.173]  And my program and Alex's program tackle very similar issues, and we really do cover the bases.
[01:00:48.193 --> 01:00:55.655]  A Closer Look airs on Saturday evening at 6 to 8 Mountain, 8 to 10 Eastern, and I encourage you to listen to that program as well.
[01:00:55.975 --> 01:00:58.716]  My website, too, is www.4acloserlook.com.
[01:00:58.736 --> 01:01:00.717]  I encourage you to go check that out as well.
[01:01:06.258 --> 01:01:13.123]  Now, as I mentioned, we're going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson coming up after the break.
[01:01:13.563 --> 01:01:21.489]  And also, Alex will join us briefly during this hour to bring us a special report from Los Angeles on the Arnold Schwarzenegger debacle.
[01:01:21.949 --> 01:01:28.053]  And as I mentioned, we're going to hear later on in the third hour from Greg Pallast, who has dug up Arnold's Enron secret.
[01:01:28.474 --> 01:01:31.736]  We may be getting closer to finding out what really the game is all about.
[01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:32.917]  There's a couple of planks to it, but...
[01:01:33.504 --> 01:01:35.444]  We're getting zeroed in on it, so stay tuned.
[01:01:35.464 --> 01:01:37.765]  There's a lot more to come on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:39.245]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:47.407]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:01:47.587 --> 01:01:52.048]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:01:52.169 --> 01:01:56.530]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:57.910]  The New World Order.
[01:01:58.690 --> 01:01:59.011]  Can emerge.
[01:01:59.712 --> 01:02:03.936]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:02:03.996 --> 01:02:10.924]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:13.067]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:02:13.447 --> 01:02:23.792]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:02:24.053 --> 01:02:29.415]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:02:29.936 --> 01:02:32.577]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:02:32.697 --> 01:02:33.718]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:02:33.758 --> 01:02:33.958]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:02:33.998 --> 01:02:34.998]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:02:42.817 --> 01:02:47.284]  I want to talk to you about a serious problem and a number of ways it may affect you.
[01:02:47.744 --> 01:02:58.480]  If you have trouble picking up your grandchild, doing the gardening, golfing, or just getting out of bed comfortably, I want to introduce you to a revolutionary new breakthrough called Feels Like a New Need.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.661]  It's just absolutely miraculous.
[01:03:00.681 --> 01:03:01.142]  It's hard to believe.
[01:03:01.162 --> 01:03:01.862]  You've got to try it.
[01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:30.283]  Oh yeah, it was amazing.
[01:03:30.383 --> 01:03:33.671]  For complete details and to try Feels Like a New Knee, call 1-800-442-1102.
[01:03:33.691 --> 01:03:33.751]  1-800-442-1102.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.160]  Hello, folks.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.140]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:50.261]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:03:50.521 --> 01:03:55.642]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:03:55.982 --> 01:04:05.304]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:04:05.624 --> 01:04:10.565]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:04:10.905 --> 01:04:14.931]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:04:15.111 --> 01:04:19.919]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:04:20.259 --> 01:04:26.168]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:35.534]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:04:35.715 --> 01:04:39.237]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:04:39.797 --> 01:04:40.898]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:48.323]  Big Brother.
[01:04:48.984 --> 01:04:50.024]  Mainstream media.
[01:04:50.745 --> 01:04:51.886]  Government cover-ups.
[01:04:51.906 --> 01:04:53.367]  You want answers?
[01:04:54.087 --> 01:04:54.868]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:55.629 --> 01:04:59.252]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:03.935]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:05:04.635 --> 01:05:06.817]  And again, sitting in for Alex is Michael Corbin.
[01:05:07.477 --> 01:05:08.578]  And Alex is away.
[01:05:08.658 --> 01:05:15.343]  He is going to be updating us from Los Angeles, California this morning, or this afternoon, I should say, in just a little bit.
[01:05:16.164 --> 01:05:23.329]  He's out there covering the Arnold Schwarzenegger gubernatorial recall effort, and Arnold's
[01:05:24.005 --> 01:05:27.046]  Buying to take over as governor of the state of California.
[01:05:27.427 --> 01:05:32.709]  And as we're finding out, there may be other reasons for why this is occurring.
[01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:35.950]  This may have been something that's been brewing for a couple of years.
[01:05:36.531 --> 01:05:38.392]  It's kind of like an insurance policy, if you will.
[01:05:38.412 --> 01:05:43.194]  We're going to find out all about that, too, because we'll be joined by Greg Pallister in the third hour.
[01:05:43.954 --> 01:05:46.595]  We're getting our guest, Paul Joseph Watson, lined up.
[01:05:46.855 --> 01:05:52.538]  And in the meantime, I want to invite you to go to Infowars.com, www.infowars.com,
[01:05:53.038 --> 01:05:53.778]  We're good to go.
[01:06:09.494 --> 01:06:15.058]  We're going to be talking about state-sponsored terrorism and how this kind of thing occurs.
[01:06:15.658 --> 01:06:21.022]  And this article kind of illustrates that, again, there's been some strange things going on.
[01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:33.391]  As I mentioned, Paul Joseph Watson talks about how the Clinton administration and the Bush administration were helping to finance Osama bin Laden.
[01:06:33.931 --> 01:06:37.574]  Now, again, this is an AP article concerning the FBI article.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:50.743]  While President Clinton was trying to broker an elusive peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the FBI was secretly funneling money to suspected Hamas figures to see if the militant group would use it for terrorist attacks.
[01:06:50.783 --> 01:06:52.464]  Of course they're going to use it for terrorist attacks.
[01:06:52.484 --> 01:06:54.744]  I wonder what the heck they thought they were going to use it for.
[01:06:56.645 --> 01:07:06.407]  The counterterrorism operation in 1998 and 1999 was run out of the FBI's Phoenix office in cooperation with Israeli intelligence and was approved by Attorney General Janet Reno.
[01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:09.163]  Several thousand dollars in U.S.
[01:07:09.243 --> 01:07:18.290]  money was sent to suspected terror supporters during the operation as the FBI tried to track the flow of cash through terror organizations.
[01:07:18.911 --> 01:07:23.575]  The FBI said in a rare acknowledgment of an undercover sting that never resulted in prosecution.
[01:07:23.595 --> 01:07:24.476]  That's interesting, too.
[01:07:25.056 --> 01:07:33.023]  Quote, This was done in conjunction with permission from the Attorney General for an ongoing operation, and Israeli authorities were aware of it.
[01:07:33.812 --> 01:07:42.940]  Now one of the FBI's key operatives, who has had a falling out with the Bureau, provided an account of the operation at a Friends closed immigration court proceeding.
[01:07:43.866 --> 01:08:04.483]  Arizona businessman Harry Ellen testified he permitted the FBI to bug his home, his car, and his office, and he allowed his Muslim Foundation's activities in the Gaza Strip to be monitored by agents and arranged a peace meeting between major Palestinian activists and gained personal access to Yasser Arafat during more than four years of cooperation with the FBI.
[01:08:05.399 --> 01:08:17.583]  Now, Ellen's FBI handler in the late 1990s was Kenneth Williams, an agent who later became famous for writing a pre-September the 11th memo to FBI headquarters warning that there were Arab pilots training at U.S.
[01:08:17.643 --> 01:08:18.263]  flight schools.
[01:08:18.683 --> 01:08:20.484]  The warning went unheeded.
[01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:31.847]  Well, now, Ellen, a Muslim convert, testified that he was taking a trip to the Gaza Strip to bring doctors to the region in the summer of 1998 when Williams asked him to provide money to a Hamas figure.
[01:08:32.207 --> 01:08:33.748]  You know, one thing as a sidebar to this...
[01:08:34.773 --> 01:08:43.076]  I interviewed a guy named John Loftus, who is an attorney, and he's worked in the intelligence agencies for many, many years.
[01:08:43.816 --> 01:08:52.298]  One of the things that he said, and again, this kind of goes back to what we're talking about, about, you know, what did the government know about the activities of these terrorists before September the 11th?
[01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:59.781]  He was talking about, you know, that there's such things as intelligence blocks, where the agency like the FBI have...
[01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.951]  We're good to go.
[01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:35.916]  Who decides whether or not something should be pursued or not?
[01:09:36.357 --> 01:09:44.391]  And at what point is it justified that they are allowed to ignore something as paramount as that?
[01:09:45.333 --> 01:09:49.336]  Anyway, our number is 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 I'm going to open the phone lines here and get some comments from you guys.
[01:09:49.356 --> 01:09:51.537]  1-800-259-9231 Now, going on with this article here about the FBI.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:18.203]  Ellen testified that the operation that he was involved in ended abruptly in 1999 when he and Williams had a series of disagreements over the operation and disputes that began when Ellen angered the FBI by having an affair with a Chinese woman suspected of espionage.
[01:10:18.703 --> 01:10:25.805]  Now, Clinton's National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, said in an interview that the White House wasn't informed of the FBI activities.
[01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:29.445]  Quote, we were not aware of any such operation.
[01:10:29.485 --> 01:10:30.726]  And that was according to Sandy Berger.
[01:10:30.746 --> 01:10:32.366]  I wonder why they weren't aware of it
[01:10:33.741 --> 01:10:39.263]  FBI officials said that they tried to get Ellen to end the relationship, and his work was terminated for failing to follow the rules.
[01:10:40.043 --> 01:10:44.484]  Now, what goes on here is interesting, is that Melvin McDonald, who is the former U.S.
[01:10:44.524 --> 01:10:52.466]  attorney in Phoenix who has championed Ellen's cause, said that the FBI's abrupt end of the investigation squandered an important intelligence opportunity.
[01:10:52.766 --> 01:10:53.366]  Of course it did.
[01:10:54.766 --> 01:10:57.287]  He says, Harry had been a tremendous resource to the Bureau.
[01:10:57.647 --> 01:11:01.048]  We did not have that many people like him with connections like that to the Middle East.
[01:11:01.696 --> 01:11:09.177]  Now, former State Intelligence Committee Chairman Dennis DeConcini, another Ellen supporter, said Ellen's work could have greatly assisted the FBI.
[01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:15.058]  But instead, you know, they're busy turning their back to it to basically allow it to happen.
[01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:16.719]  Gosh.
[01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:18.919]  Well, anyway, check out Infowars.com.
[01:11:18.979 --> 01:11:21.240]  It's www.infowars.com.
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:27.681]  Also, congressional reports out now that says that terrorists could buy special equipment from the Pentagon.
[01:11:27.721 --> 01:11:28.721]  Again, you know, another one of these...
[01:11:29.671 --> 01:11:40.958]  Interesting stories that ABC News has provided that the GAO found that the Department of Defense has not attempted to determine who is buying some of these exotic weapons, biological weapons.
[01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:43.820]  Let's see here.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:56.928]  According to a draft report which came out by the General Accounting Office, which was obtained by ABC News, according to this report, which is due to be released today and discussed in a hearing of the House Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security,
[01:11:57.572 --> 01:12:06.018]  Congress ordered the GAO, its investigative arm, to set up a phony company to see how easy it would be to buy surplus lab equipment from the Pentagon.
[01:12:06.858 --> 01:12:24.991]  Now, using fake names, GAO investigators went to a website that sells Pentagon surplus and ordered items that were needed to produce bacteriological weapons, including evaporators, centrifuges, bacteriological incubators, and protective clothing.
[01:12:26.005 --> 01:12:27.466]  Anybody can really walk in and buy it.
[01:12:28.586 --> 01:12:36.829]  In its report, the GAO found that the Department of Defense has not attempted to determine who is buying excess biological equipment and how these items were being used.
[01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:47.692]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is an example of how inefficient and how incapable the government is of protecting you from terrorists.
[01:12:48.652 --> 01:12:50.133]  You know, I'm amazed.
[01:12:50.948 --> 01:12:58.393]  They actually could get you to believe that they can provide you safety and security from terrorism and from terrorist activities.
[01:12:58.713 --> 01:12:59.393]  They cannot do it.
[01:12:59.853 --> 01:13:02.375]  One thing, too, to keep in mind is over in Israel.
[01:13:03.496 --> 01:13:09.099]  And this kind of harkens back to the idea that they're taking our liberties and they're couching it in the war on terrorism.
[01:13:09.659 --> 01:13:12.141]  But you look at Israel, which is a virtual police state.
[01:13:12.725 --> 01:13:12.925]  Sure.
[01:13:13.466 --> 01:13:25.715]  You know, they may not have had a plane hijacked in a long, long time, but nevertheless, they're still having bombs going off in Israel, killing lots and lots of people, and there's nothing that they can do to stop it.
[01:13:26.556 --> 01:13:27.617]  The same thing applies here.
[01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:36.964]  I mean, just that this ABC News report illustrates that there is no way that the government is able to protect you from terrorism, from anything like that.
[01:13:37.304 --> 01:13:39.826]  You know, you have a responsibility to your family's
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:47.844]  You have a responsibility to your communities to be responsible and take care of the things that you take care of.
[01:13:48.445 --> 01:13:52.407]  Defending your family, defending your property, and taking care of your own.
[01:13:53.388 --> 01:13:56.750]  And that should not be left to the government to do, because the government cannot do it.
[01:13:56.790 --> 01:14:01.453]  It's not an efficient system, nor is it possible to do.
[01:14:03.508 --> 01:14:15.147]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 As I mentioned, coming up a little bit later on in the bottom of the hour today Alex Jones is going to be joining us from Los Angeles to give us a special report.
[01:14:15.732 --> 01:14:16.953]  I think we're good to go.
[01:14:37.665 --> 01:14:58.429]  You know, it's my belief from just observing what's going on out there, it's my belief that one of the things that they're trying to do is they're going to get Schwarzenegger in position to assure that California, and we know they've got Florida sewed up because of the fiasco that took place back in 2000, they want to assure that they have California and Florida, which are two very, very important states.
[01:14:59.205 --> 01:15:00.086]  We're good to go.
[01:15:14.989 --> 01:15:30.218]  The interesting thing about this whole thing is what Palace has discovered about this $9 billion fiasco with Enron and how important it might be that Arnold be elected because apparently Arnold attended...
[01:15:30.891 --> 01:15:31.772]  We're good to go.
[01:15:46.266 --> 01:16:07.821]  Well, the deal is that there's been a suit filed by California, the state of California, by none other than Cruz Bustamante, demanding that the $9 billion in profits that were taken out by the oil companies during that fiasco back in the late 90s and in the early 2000s, demanding that that $9 billion be refunded to the state of California.
[01:16:07.841 --> 01:16:15.486]  Well, of course, our president and others in his orbit have a vested interest in some of these companies that...
[01:16:16.278 --> 01:16:20.082]  Looted the $9 billion, and they're going to make sure that it doesn't come back to you.
[01:16:20.102 --> 01:16:21.183]  1-800-259-9231, lines are open.
[01:16:21.203 --> 01:16:21.283]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:16:21.303 --> 01:16:22.585]  We'll be right back after this.
[01:16:43.382 --> 01:16:47.285]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:16:47.505 --> 01:16:59.795]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:00.616]  The U.S.
[01:17:00.656 --> 01:17:06.241]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:17:06.641 --> 01:17:08.863]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:17:10.724 --> 01:17:11.185]  We're good to go.
[01:17:31.543 --> 01:17:31.743]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:17:43.175 --> 01:17:53.901]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:17:54.082 --> 01:18:01.686]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:18:01.926 --> 01:18:05.048]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:18:05.208 --> 01:18:05.588]  We're good to go.
[01:18:23.874 --> 01:18:29.820]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:34.004]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:18:58.453 --> 01:18:59.033]  We're good to go.
[01:19:15.325 --> 01:19:15.865]  We're good to go.
[01:19:15.905 --> 01:19:16.466]  We're good to go.
[01:19:42.099 --> 01:19:42.920]  Oh my God!
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:47.905]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:19:48.206 --> 01:19:48.866]  Yes, it's true.
[01:19:48.966 --> 01:19:51.669]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:19:51.789 --> 01:19:55.814]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:19:55.934 --> 01:19:56.494]  You heard it right.
[01:19:56.675 --> 01:20:01.680]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.561]  That's 1-800-615-7094 for drugs like Phentermine,

[01:20:54.622 --> 01:20:57.903]  We continue 1-800-259-9231.
[01:20:57.923 --> 01:20:57.983]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:20:58.003 --> 01:21:02.344]  Lines are wide open now.
[01:21:02.984 --> 01:21:03.724]  We've got some callers.
[01:21:04.385 --> 01:21:11.907]  And I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones, who is going to join us at the bottom of the hour to give us an update, a special report from Los Angeles, California.
[01:21:12.507 --> 01:21:13.587]  And we're looking forward to that.
[01:21:13.607 --> 01:21:14.667]  Let's go ahead and go to the phones.
[01:21:15.427 --> 01:21:16.908]  Paul is calling in from New Jersey.
[01:21:16.948 --> 01:21:19.108]  Good morning or good afternoon, Paul, depending on where you are.
[01:21:19.429 --> 01:21:20.569]  New Jersey or afternoon.
[01:21:20.589 --> 01:21:21.069]  Good afternoon.
[01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:24.918]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:21:25.699 --> 01:21:27.200]  Charlie from South Carolina.
[01:21:27.901 --> 01:21:28.221]  Go there.
[01:21:28.581 --> 01:21:29.021]  Yes, sir.
[01:21:29.362 --> 01:21:29.842]  Hi, Charlie.
[01:21:30.202 --> 01:21:30.783]  How are you, Mike?
[01:21:30.983 --> 01:21:31.643]  I'm doing good.
[01:21:31.663 --> 01:21:33.585]  First time I ever talked to you.
[01:21:33.625 --> 01:21:34.946]  I've talked to Alex before.
[01:21:35.226 --> 01:21:37.848]  But I have to make a disagreement with you.
[01:21:38.148 --> 01:21:38.408]  Okay.
[01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:42.531]  And when you say that there's nothing the government can do about it, sure there is.
[01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:43.452]  They suck doing it.
[01:21:43.892 --> 01:21:44.873]  They're the ones that are doing it.
[01:21:45.996 --> 01:21:52.200]  And not only that, they can close up the borders, stop interfering with other people, and so forth.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.801]  There's a lot of things they could do.
[01:21:54.081 --> 01:21:54.581]  You're darn right.
[01:21:54.641 --> 01:21:56.703]  Go ahead, Charlie, go ahead.
[01:21:56.743 --> 01:22:03.527]  But we've got a Gestapo, New World Order government, and that's what they're going to do, interfering with other people.
[01:22:03.567 --> 01:22:05.648]  I mean, they say Saddam Hussein is a dictator.
[01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:08.290]  Well, he's mild compared to what we've got.
[01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:09.491]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:22:10.431 --> 01:22:12.432]  So, I mean, there's a lot they can do about it.
[01:22:12.913 --> 01:22:13.613]  I think, you know...
[01:22:16.813 --> 01:22:22.295]  Well, I should say, the government stopped doing what they were supposed to do, and they're doing what they're not supposed to do now.
[01:22:22.315 --> 01:22:22.475]  Right?
[01:22:22.515 --> 01:22:24.415]  Yeah, well, they're the ones behind it all.
[01:22:39.424 --> 01:22:40.184]  That's right.
[01:22:40.385 --> 01:22:45.107]  I mean, common sense talk, they're not closing the borders up, right?
[01:22:45.407 --> 01:22:45.867]  No, they're not.
[01:22:45.907 --> 01:22:46.987]  Everybody's falling over.
[01:22:47.408 --> 01:22:50.769]  And they're not concerned about their family being terrorized, are they?
[01:22:51.369 --> 01:22:55.371]  No, but you know the thing is... So doesn't that tell you that they're the ones that are doing it?
[01:22:55.951 --> 01:22:56.332]  Of course.
[01:22:56.352 --> 01:22:57.112]  They're not concerned.
[01:22:58.342 --> 01:22:59.863]  They're not concerned about us anymore.
[01:22:59.943 --> 01:23:00.803]  They're not concerned about us.
[01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:02.544]  They want to deconstruct our society.
[01:23:02.584 --> 01:23:06.766]  They're not even concerned about themselves being terrorized because they're the ones that are doing it.
[01:23:06.926 --> 01:23:07.306]  That's right.
[01:23:07.346 --> 01:23:08.646]  That's why they're not closing up the borders.
[01:23:08.706 --> 01:23:09.046]  That's right.
[01:23:09.066 --> 01:23:10.747]  Common sense tells you that.
[01:23:11.047 --> 01:23:15.829]  Sure, and the thing is that there's a couple of things that are going on here when they do this.
[01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:19.951]  Number one, they're not maintaining the integrity of American culture.
[01:23:19.971 --> 01:23:20.411]  Number two...
[01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:28.833]  They're not facilitating or not providing the reason for coming to America in the first place.
[01:23:29.413 --> 01:23:30.714]  Face it, we're a melting pot.
[01:23:30.754 --> 01:23:31.674]  We were a melting pot.
[01:23:32.054 --> 01:23:39.756]  But you came to America because America was America, and it was free from the tyranny and oppression that they were experiencing in their countries.
[01:23:40.296 --> 01:23:43.377]  And the problem is that now we're letting all these folks in,
[01:23:44.077 --> 01:23:45.557]  Number one, we don't know who's here.
[01:23:46.078 --> 01:23:49.338]  The terrorists are here, and we don't know what they're doing.
[01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:54.400]  The second thing of it is that they don't adhere to American values and cultures.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:57.360]  So there's nothing organized or anything about it.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.681]  It's a complete desecration of our culture.
[01:24:01.021 --> 01:24:07.023]  Well, you know, bin Laden and al-Qaeda is George Bush's, the Bush crime family buddies.
[01:24:07.263 --> 01:24:07.683]  That's right.
[01:24:07.823 --> 01:24:08.143]  That's right.
[01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:10.023]  And they set it all up.
[01:24:10.543 --> 01:24:12.784]  They're going to keep doing it.
[01:24:13.337 --> 01:24:13.537]  Yeah.
[01:24:13.837 --> 01:24:15.177]  They're going to keep doing it until they're done.
[01:24:15.197 --> 01:24:18.238]  The only way we're going to change this country, I'll tell you the only way we're going to change it.
[01:24:18.678 --> 01:24:18.878]  How's that?
[01:24:18.898 --> 01:24:21.139]  The people of this country are going to demand paper ballots.
[01:24:22.199 --> 01:24:37.963]  Well, that's one way, but I mentioned yesterday one of the things that's going to... The only way I see that this is going to be reversed is for every person in the United States and around the world to get back to what is right and get back to the basics and think right, because...
[01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:48.614]  Until that happens, until we get over our greediness and our material... You know, we cannot be totally materialistic and hope to succeed as a culture or as a people.
[01:24:48.894 --> 01:24:49.754]  It just will not happen.
[01:24:50.054 --> 01:24:53.876]  You're not going to get anybody in there to do the right thing unless you get paper ballots.
[01:24:54.156 --> 01:24:57.578]  Because they're going to steal the vote.
[01:24:57.598 --> 01:25:05.924]  Yeah, but you've got to get people in there that understand that they're there at the behest of the people, not at the behest of the corporations or the ruling elite.
[01:25:06.284 --> 01:25:07.025]  That's the problem.
[01:25:07.425 --> 01:25:11.928]  The paper ballots will help get the right people in there, but you've got to vote for the right people to start with.
[01:25:12.268 --> 01:25:15.230]  You've got to educate the people.
[01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:20.974]  Jeff Buchanan won up in New Hampshire because they had paper ballots.
[01:25:21.434 --> 01:25:22.095]  What's happened to him?
[01:25:22.754 --> 01:25:26.316]  Well, he's a losing case now.
[01:25:26.396 --> 01:25:28.477]  I don't know what he's up to.
[01:25:28.717 --> 01:25:29.597]  Something's happened to him.
[01:25:29.637 --> 01:25:31.418]  I mean, I've seen him kind of change over the years.
[01:25:31.738 --> 01:25:32.719]  He's kind of gotten soft.
[01:25:32.759 --> 01:25:33.999]  He's changed, yeah.
[01:25:34.279 --> 01:25:35.400]  Yeah, he's gotten soft.
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:41.703]  Yeah, but the thing is, you know, everybody criticizes Kennedy.
[01:25:41.963 --> 01:25:42.163]  Yeah.
[01:25:42.623 --> 01:25:44.965]  Kennedy was the only one that was trying to do the right thing.
[01:25:45.505 --> 01:25:45.705]  Yeah.
[01:25:46.225 --> 01:25:47.986]  He was going to try to change this whole thing.
[01:25:48.642 --> 01:25:54.166]  I know he was mixed up with the, you know, his old man was the one that was behind all that garbage anyway.
[01:25:54.186 --> 01:25:55.247]  Well, yeah.
[01:25:56.307 --> 01:26:01.211]  If you don't get paper ballots then, you know what happened in South Carolina here?
[01:26:02.328 --> 01:26:06.231]  I don't know if you heard Attorney General Charlie Condon.
[01:26:06.251 --> 01:26:07.973]  Charlie, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we've got to move on.
[01:26:07.993 --> 01:26:09.154]  We've got to take a break, okay?
[01:26:09.594 --> 01:26:10.195]  Thanks for calling.
[01:26:10.215 --> 01:26:12.016]  Keep listening.
[01:26:12.036 --> 01:26:15.679]  1-800-259-9231 is our number.
[01:26:15.699 --> 01:26:15.960]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.363]  Alex Jones is coming up next with a special report from Los Angeles, so stay tuned.
[01:26:20.804 --> 01:26:21.404]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[01:26:21.424 --> 01:26:23.406]  There's a lot more to come on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:26:23.726 --> 01:26:24.527]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:33.425 --> 01:26:34.326]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.806 --> 01:26:36.427]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.348 --> 01:26:40.150]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.572 --> 01:26:45.874]  Hi, my name is Donald from thegoldenanswer.com.
[01:26:46.194 --> 01:26:48.355]  Everyone knows that they need to own gold and silver.
[01:26:48.575 --> 01:26:49.876]  You see the headlines every day.
[01:26:50.156 --> 01:26:52.538]  It's the only safe haven in these turbulent times.
[01:26:52.878 --> 01:26:55.700]  Many of you want to acquire... That's 800-569-4340 or visit the web at cliffscott.com.
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:57.221]  I use it every day and it works.
[01:27:12.348 --> 01:27:12.849]  We continue.
[01:27:12.889 --> 01:27:18.493]  I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones, who's going to join us momentarily from Los Angeles with a special report.
[01:27:18.853 --> 01:27:25.237]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:27:25.257 --> 01:27:25.878]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:27:25.918 --> 01:27:27.419]  And the lines are open, so give us a call.
[01:27:27.979 --> 01:27:30.201]  Now, let's go ahead and go back to the phones.
[01:27:30.301 --> 01:27:31.522]  We talked to Charlie in South Carolina.
[01:27:31.542 --> 01:27:32.762]  Let's go to Warren in Colorado.
[01:27:33.163 --> 01:27:33.843]  Good afternoon, Warren.
[01:27:33.883 --> 01:27:34.404]  You're on the air.
[01:27:34.424 --> 01:27:36.745]  Nice to hear you on 1360.
[01:27:36.825 --> 01:27:37.566]  Out of the
[01:27:41.522 --> 01:27:42.223]  Johnstown.
[01:27:42.543 --> 01:27:44.905]  We get a better signal out here in northeast Colorado.
[01:27:45.305 --> 01:27:45.706]  Oh, okay.
[01:27:46.646 --> 01:27:48.068]  I'm just down the street from you, actually.
[01:27:48.108 --> 01:27:48.648]  I'm in Denver.
[01:27:49.309 --> 01:27:49.769]  Oh, cool.
[01:27:50.029 --> 01:27:50.870]  Yeah.
[01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.570]  All right.
[01:27:51.951 --> 01:27:53.112]  What was your website again?
[01:27:53.772 --> 01:27:54.833]  www.
[01:27:55.814 --> 01:27:59.757]  and then the number four, acloserlook.com.
[01:28:00.738 --> 01:28:01.058]  Okay.
[01:28:02.039 --> 01:28:02.480]  I've got it.
[01:28:03.781 --> 01:28:07.364]  You've been all over the... You've touched on a lot of things today.
[01:28:08.044 --> 01:28:08.224]  Yeah.
[01:28:08.244 --> 01:28:08.365]  But...
[01:28:09.341 --> 01:28:27.605]  I'll tell you what, that Arnold Schwarzenegger thing with the... It's incredible how far this country's gone where, you know, we used to just discount a person like that to run, and I can't wait for Alex to come on and give us an update.
[01:28:27.625 --> 01:28:28.625]  He's with us now.
[01:28:28.925 --> 01:28:31.486]  We're going to go to him as soon as I'm done on the call with you.
[01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:32.746]  Okay, well...
[01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:35.932]  Keep up the good work, and we'll talk to you later.
[01:28:35.952 --> 01:28:36.872]  All right, thanks for calling.
[01:28:37.393 --> 01:28:41.597]  Okay, and as promised, Alex Jones is on with us from Los Angeles, California.
[01:28:41.637 --> 01:28:42.437]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:28:42.818 --> 01:28:43.518]  How are you doing?
[01:28:44.279 --> 01:28:44.919]  Great, Michael.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:52.226]  Just to give you an update, I mean, obviously everybody knows as much about this race as we do from watching the news, at least on the surface.
[01:28:52.964 --> 01:29:00.452]  But it's obvious that they're focusing on the sexual allegations, just like they did with Bill Clinton, instead of focusing on the real meat and potato issues.
[01:29:00.472 --> 01:29:02.254]  Now, I'm not saying it's okay what Arnold's done.
[01:29:02.274 --> 01:29:05.998]  When you've got over 20 women saying this, whether it's smoke or fire, as he admits...
[01:29:06.850 --> 01:29:08.972]  And, you know, obviously the guy's an out-of-control animal.
[01:29:09.112 --> 01:29:14.296]  I mean, this is more than just groping from these allegations, and he hasn't denied it.
[01:29:14.336 --> 01:29:22.863]  In fact, they now have a new term for him, the apologinator, I believe, is the new term.
[01:29:23.944 --> 01:29:25.565]  But just like with Monica Lewinsky...
[01:29:26.394 --> 01:29:26.514]  Right.
[01:29:26.534 --> 01:29:26.654]  Right.
[01:29:43.014 --> 01:29:45.236]  And what he's done with women.
[01:30:02.242 --> 01:30:02.382]  Right.
[01:30:02.402 --> 01:30:02.482]  Yep.
[01:30:31.619 --> 01:30:46.907]  But to have them in the news focusing on, oh, these allegations with the sex, with the women, it's much more serious to have the comments where he wants to be a dictator, he wants to be worshipped by crowds at Nuremberg, he admires Hitler.
[01:30:46.967 --> 01:30:58.773]  So really, I'm sure that now from watching it and from being here on the ground, that that's the diversion, that's the distraction, because he couldn't survive having to say, oh, well, I don't know why I said I loved Hitler.
[01:30:59.473 --> 01:30:59.694]  Sure.
[01:30:59.854 --> 01:31:00.074]  Sure.
[01:31:22.293 --> 01:31:28.496]  Voting system, and Diebold was caught in the 2002 election manipulating votes right here in California.
[01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:40.401]  And Diebold and others are doing everything they can to keep this story under wraps, but at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com we have a touchscreen electronic voting fraud section that really proves that all of this is going on.
[01:31:40.801 --> 01:31:45.163]  But I would predict, and it's not a hard prediction to make, that on the one way or another,
[01:31:45.723 --> 01:31:55.027]  We'll end up the apologidator, or however you want to say it, will be the next governor here in the fifth largest economy in the world.
[01:31:55.047 --> 01:32:04.892]  Then you've got Orrin Hatch, who admitted to the Associated Press there's a Republican and a Democrat version of a bill to start the repeal of the 22nd Amendment to the U.S.
[01:32:04.932 --> 01:32:09.214]  Constitution so that Arnold can run for president.
[01:32:09.234 --> 01:32:13.676]  So they've got big plans for Arnold Schwarzenegger, and now they've lowered the bar even further.
[01:32:14.136 --> 01:32:14.596]  We're good to go.
[01:32:32.746 --> 01:32:33.887]  You can say all of this.
[01:32:33.907 --> 01:32:35.208]  You can be involved in all this.
[01:32:35.228 --> 01:32:37.529]  You can smoke pot on video.
[01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:40.652]  You can be a steroid addict.
[01:32:40.732 --> 01:32:45.735]  You can have one of the dirtiest mouths out there, and the neocons will love you.
[01:32:45.755 --> 01:32:55.502]  But if you're a real conservative, a real patriot, a real Christian, you'll be called a devil worshiper by the Pat Robertsons of the world who say that forced abortion and infanticide is a good thing in China.
[01:32:55.902 --> 01:33:04.208]  So they're really scrambling the terms now today, and there's a conditioning process going on where they go, well, the bar's been lowered.
[01:33:04.228 --> 01:33:05.569]  This is just no big deal.
[01:33:06.009 --> 01:33:07.550]  All these women coming out and saying this.
[01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:24.221]  You know, Alex, granted, and the observation is very accurate, the sexual scandal, from a political standpoint, with everything that's come before Arnold, is a very manageable scandal that doesn't really detract necessarily from the candidate.
[01:33:25.629 --> 01:33:28.250]  What do you see at a deeper level?
[01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:32.552]  What do you see as the real appeal of Arnold for the governor of California?
[01:33:34.272 --> 01:33:36.473]  Well, it's fluff.
[01:33:36.573 --> 01:33:36.993]  It's hype.
[01:33:37.013 --> 01:33:50.298]  I mean, the World Bank and IMF have said in their own documents that whenever they come in and blow out an economy and consolidate it, which is where they get their power from, they print the money.
[01:33:50.338 --> 01:33:53.099]  Everything's about getting us overextended and getting control of us.
[01:33:54.099 --> 01:33:54.279]  Mm-hmm.
[01:33:54.359 --> 01:33:54.579]  Yeah.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:55.100]  Yeah.
[01:34:18.203 --> 01:34:18.804]  We're good to go.
[01:34:27.859 --> 01:34:29.320]  They call it the IMF riot.
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:31.621]  Then when there's no food, people go even more crazy.
[01:34:31.961 --> 01:34:34.202]  Then they have to call the army out to, quote, restore order.
[01:34:34.542 --> 01:34:35.842]  This is all by design.
[01:34:35.882 --> 01:34:44.306]  They want things to race all the way to the bottom, like they've done in Iraq and many other countries, like they've done in Serbia, like they're doing in Argentina, just with economics, not with the military.
[01:34:45.086 --> 01:34:53.290]  And then after they've been able to do that, they can then come in and totally rebuild the entire economy with 100% ownership of the New World Order.
[01:34:53.370 --> 01:34:55.791]  So it's the same thing with Arnold or Bustamante.
[01:34:57.046 --> 01:35:08.216]  For any of these people, you put in the establishment candidate with the left flavor or the right-wing flavor, but the actual actions are identical.
[01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:10.397]  Just the rhetoric might be slightly different.
[01:35:10.758 --> 01:35:19.525]  And so Arnold is perfect for this Hollywood surface culture because he is a total and complete puppy.
[01:35:19.745 --> 01:35:25.070]  He looks like a robot when he's out there walking around with the little kids, you know, children for Arnold.
[01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:25.690]  I think so.
[01:35:54.432 --> 01:35:55.754]  He's just a bunch of hype.
[01:35:56.034 --> 01:35:57.596]  We'll just give them bread and circus.
[01:35:57.876 --> 01:36:09.371]  We'll just give them a bunch of hype instead of real substance, instead of somebody like a McClintock, who by the way is not perfect, but at least is pro-gun and wants to control the border.
[01:36:09.631 --> 01:36:23.945]  I mean, this is a great example for the globalists and the media of how they can sell socialism and big government and Nazism and perverted garbage at every level and still make it palatable and sell it to the people.
[01:36:23.985 --> 01:36:29.010]  So this is also a test for the population of will they buy this type of bondage.
[01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:32.013]  I think the answer is, at least out here in California...
[01:36:33.035 --> 01:36:34.937]  The propagandas work quite nicely on them.
[01:36:35.237 --> 01:36:35.397]  Yeah.
[01:36:35.737 --> 01:36:41.421]  You know, on Infowars.com, you have an article on there about the Nazis in W's closet.
[01:36:41.882 --> 01:36:51.949]  This is kind of an example, too, of the kinds of people that he surrounds himself with, and these guys are about their own unified agenda to take over things.
[01:36:53.350 --> 01:37:00.516]  Greg Palast is coming up in the next hour to talk about his discovery of the Enron secret, Arnold's Enron secret, which may...
[01:37:01.176 --> 01:37:13.870]  Have something to do with why it was so important to get Arnold in as governor because of this $9 billion profit, $9 or $10 billion profit that was taken by the oil companies, one of George Bush's favorite games to play.
[01:37:14.671 --> 01:37:16.131]  Yeah, it's incredibly disgusting.
[01:37:16.151 --> 01:37:18.852]  I mean, I have to watch when the news go, Bring me the broom.
[01:37:19.252 --> 01:37:20.232]  Bring me the broom.
[01:37:20.252 --> 01:37:22.092]  We're going to sweep Davis out.
[01:37:22.452 --> 01:37:23.993]  No more special interest.
[01:37:24.253 --> 01:37:27.273]  No more money in Sacramento.
[01:37:27.573 --> 01:37:31.794]  What you've been doing is wrong, and the people are sick and tired of it.
[01:37:32.094 --> 01:37:34.834]  We're going to deal with it.
[01:37:34.954 --> 01:37:35.975]  I've got plenty of money.
[01:37:36.035 --> 01:37:37.095]  I don't need no more money.
[01:37:37.115 --> 01:37:39.615]  Yeah, like, people don't want more power.
[01:37:39.915 --> 01:37:43.556]  And then we know from months ago, and again, it's in the article I wrote back on...
[01:37:44.376 --> 01:37:45.317]  We're good to go.
[01:38:01.551 --> 01:38:02.991]  I mean, Arnold's involved in all this.
[01:38:03.051 --> 01:38:07.252]  Arnold is a really serious, quote, businessman in all these backroom deals.
[01:38:07.292 --> 01:38:09.633]  He's connected to all these different people.
[01:38:09.673 --> 01:38:23.176]  So you're going to see a further milking and raiding of the state if they tell people, there's no more money, we're in debt, you're going to have to, you know, we're going to raise all these taxes, we're going to have a car tax, we're going to have 14 other taxes, and then they suck the conservatives in to go, okay, how are we going to pay for it?
[01:38:23.516 --> 01:38:29.877]  When in transit, look at the comprehensive annual financial reports, the double set of books that states, counties, and cities have, these guys have plenty of money.
[01:38:30.317 --> 01:38:39.602]  So again, it's just about a process of Buffalo and California with a spectacle, a smoke screen, and they're accepting all this, and there's Arnold going, we're going to stop this corruption.
[01:38:39.902 --> 01:38:41.723]  It's absolutely horrible.
[01:38:42.223 --> 01:38:43.944]  I want to do something about it.
[01:38:44.044 --> 01:38:45.264]  It's just terrible.
[01:38:45.985 --> 01:38:56.109]  And he's more intimately involved with Enron and with Bush and his cronies that did it than Governor Davis, who, by the way, was involved in the scam with him as well, according to the Sacramento Bee.
[01:38:56.690 --> 01:38:59.031]  A couple years ago, I saw the articles where he would buy
[01:38:59.969 --> 01:39:00.069]  Yeah.
[01:39:00.089 --> 01:39:00.229]  Yeah.
[01:39:24.255 --> 01:39:26.117]  And it's total bread in the circus.
[01:39:26.217 --> 01:39:36.886]  I mean, it's like going to a hockey game or something where we all have stacks of T-shirts throwing out the bread in the circus and some heavy metal band going, We're not going to take it.
[01:39:37.667 --> 01:39:39.629]  No, we ain't going to take it.
[01:39:40.369 --> 01:39:43.831]  We're not gonna take it anymore.
[01:39:43.891 --> 01:39:49.475]  I mean, it's just total... Again, people want the sugar-coated cyanide pill, and they're gonna get it.
[01:39:49.635 --> 01:39:50.155]  They're gonna get it, right.
[01:39:50.175 --> 01:39:53.037]  I don't know why they don't have jobs and why all these new taxes are going up.
[01:39:53.277 --> 01:39:59.121]  California's the model for the rest of the country, and this is a beta test for bigger things for Arnold later.
[01:39:59.381 --> 01:39:59.982]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:40:00.402 --> 01:40:00.742]  That's right.
[01:40:00.922 --> 01:40:03.124]  You know, I'm gonna cast a movie called Take California.
[01:40:03.144 --> 01:40:05.225]  I'm gonna cast you as the lead actor in it, okay?
[01:40:05.685 --> 01:40:06.566]  Bring me the broom.
[01:40:06.586 --> 01:40:07.607]  Bring me the broom.
[01:40:07.627 --> 01:40:08.347]  Bring me the broom.
[01:40:09.212 --> 01:40:10.173]  I don't know.
[01:40:10.434 --> 01:40:11.935]  Let me just tell you something, Michael.
[01:40:12.355 --> 01:40:14.137]  It's so honored to be on your broadcast.
[01:40:14.177 --> 01:40:16.939]  We are going to end corruption in California.
[01:40:16.959 --> 01:40:17.920]  I can't wait.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:26.088]  Let me tell you, don't worry about me working with Enron to keep the regulation going, to keep the scam going into the tens of billions.
[01:40:26.688 --> 01:40:27.169]  That's right.
[01:40:27.209 --> 01:40:28.029]  Hey, hey, hey.
[01:40:31.491 --> 01:40:35.499]  Listen, listen, I apologize for that too.
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:37.864]  I'm the apologinator.
[01:40:38.706 --> 01:40:39.488]  That's right.
[01:40:41.452 --> 01:40:42.314]  You want to take some calls?
[01:40:44.299 --> 01:40:50.983]  Sure, just one or two, because I've got to go out here and cover this story, and I've also got some meetings over here as we fight the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:51.004 --> 01:40:51.744]  Okay, let's do that.
[01:40:51.764 --> 01:40:54.005]  We've only got a couple minutes in this segment anyway.
[01:40:54.045 --> 01:40:55.646]  Let's take a call from Bill in Arkansas.
[01:40:55.666 --> 01:40:56.547]  Good afternoon, Bill.
[01:40:56.567 --> 01:40:57.908]  You're on with Alex Jones.
[01:40:58.148 --> 01:40:59.109]  Bring me the broom.
[01:40:59.629 --> 01:41:04.052]  Oh, man, well, I'm trying to keep rolling on the ground out here, but I'm talking like Arnold.
[01:41:04.152 --> 01:41:05.433]  I swear it sounds just like him.
[01:41:05.593 --> 01:41:07.474]  He does a darn good job at it.
[01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:17.897]  Well, I tell you what, Alex, he fit right in.
[01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:19.458]  Help people let him out there.
[01:41:19.718 --> 01:41:20.978]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:41:21.258 --> 01:41:29.381]  I was calling, I might be a little bit offbeat, but you're talking about open borders and the Patriot Act and what is this, Homeland Security?
[01:41:29.541 --> 01:41:31.041]  Homeland Insecurity.
[01:41:31.201 --> 01:41:32.461]  Yeah, Homeland Security.
[01:41:32.702 --> 01:41:33.582]  You know, big thing.
[01:41:33.622 --> 01:41:33.802]  Yeah.
[01:41:34.562 --> 01:41:37.363]  Well, I work for the Department of Emergency Management.
[01:41:38.211 --> 01:41:40.413]  I was part of the Sheriff's Association.
[01:41:41.333 --> 01:41:42.334]  I worked for FEMA.
[01:41:43.515 --> 01:41:45.396]  This ain't nothing but a big bunch of bulls.
[01:41:45.857 --> 01:41:50.140]  Ain't nothing there to grab people's freedom away from them and using it for a good excuse.
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.002]  Well, you see, we've got to take your freedom to keep you safe.
[01:41:54.062 --> 01:41:55.403]  I learned this in Austria.
[01:41:55.844 --> 01:42:00.087]  We had another great Austrian leader who did what he had to for the people.
[01:42:00.767 --> 01:42:03.729]  For the people of Nazi-arming California.
[01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:07.172]  Well, you know, I sat around hearing it.
[01:42:07.665 --> 01:42:10.468]  You know, the country here a while back was on the Orange State Alert.
[01:42:11.228 --> 01:42:12.670]  I got a call in from Little Rock.
[01:42:13.170 --> 01:42:16.073]  We're on the Orange State Alert, you know, and everything.
[01:42:16.473 --> 01:42:17.434]  Didn't get me excited.
[01:42:17.474 --> 01:42:18.515]  I knew that was going to happen.
[01:42:19.725 --> 01:42:25.451]  Well, it's all trying to go under federal control, and it even came out last year.
[01:42:25.491 --> 01:42:26.772]  This was admitted by the White House.
[01:42:26.832 --> 01:42:34.899]  They were, quote, scripting terror alerts for political gain, ordering the CIA and FBI to put out fake terror assessments to, quote, create hysteria.
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:35.840]  That's the White House memo.
[01:42:36.081 --> 01:42:36.821]  Create hysteria.
[01:42:36.861 --> 01:42:38.463]  Now, if Michael Corbyn or Alex Jones or
[01:42:39.472 --> 01:42:41.673]  Well, I'm not a big fan of Bush, that's for sure.
[01:42:41.693 --> 01:42:43.433]  No, I'm not a fan of gun control at all.
[01:42:43.454 --> 01:42:45.254]  Open borders, let's talk about open borders.
[01:42:45.754 --> 01:42:48.335]  I live in the state of Arkansas where chicken plants are at.
[01:42:48.355 --> 01:42:51.756]  I mean, you know, the little old town I live in is about 3,000 and
[01:43:07.575 --> 01:43:11.517]  I think about a thousand of them are illegal immigrants working at a chicken plant, you know?
[01:43:11.597 --> 01:43:21.421]  Well, and you see, the government lets these big corporations create these felonies, and then the little companies go out of business because, number one, the INS will raid them if they've got two illegals working there.
[01:43:22.208 --> 01:43:24.789]  And they just can't compete against this.
[01:43:25.429 --> 01:43:30.430]  And so, again, the IMF World Bank plan is to get rid of the middle class.
[01:43:30.930 --> 01:43:31.910]  And that's what's happening here.
[01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:43.513]  Disarm us, repossess our way of life, get us dependent, get us into the system, either on welfare or the criminal justice system, or into big pharma and the psychological...
[01:43:44.994 --> 01:43:45.774]  We're good to go.
[01:44:08.695 --> 01:44:09.816]  No, I don't like it.
[01:44:09.876 --> 01:44:16.219]  I'll tell you what there, you know, Bush, a lot of people here in Arkansas voted for him because they thought he wasn't a gun grabber.
[01:44:16.659 --> 01:44:18.901]  Well, he's going to grab guns like everybody else.
[01:44:19.301 --> 01:44:20.302]  Hey, Bill, we've got to move on.
[01:44:20.442 --> 01:44:21.202]  We're about out of time.
[01:44:21.522 --> 01:44:22.183]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:22.483 --> 01:44:24.664]  Hey, Alex, listen, are you going to give us an update tomorrow?
[01:44:25.714 --> 01:44:26.234]  Absolutely.
[01:44:26.334 --> 01:44:27.616]  I will give you an update tomorrow.
[01:44:27.656 --> 01:44:28.958]  And Michael, you're doing a great job.
[01:44:28.978 --> 01:44:30.179]  I appreciate you pulling in for the show.
[01:44:30.219 --> 01:44:34.264]  And I hope that folks will visit Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:44:34.304 --> 01:44:37.769]  And I hope they'll get the new book by Paul Watson, Order Out of Chaos.
[01:44:37.789 --> 01:44:40.192]  I hope they'll get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:44:40.512 --> 01:44:41.173]  Okay, Alex.
[01:44:41.213 --> 01:44:42.134]  Thanks a lot.
[01:44:42.174 --> 01:44:43.054]  We'll talk to you later.
[01:44:59.011 --> 01:44:59.571]  Okay, that's it.
[01:44:59.892 --> 01:45:00.832]  We'll be right back after this.
[01:45:00.852 --> 01:45:01.333]  Stay tuned.
[01:45:01.813 --> 01:45:03.454]  I'm Michael Corbin filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:45:03.474 --> 01:45:04.054]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:04.415 --> 01:45:10.658]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:45:10.779 --> 01:45:16.942]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:45:17.223 --> 01:45:25.588]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:45:25.908 --> 01:45:32.953]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:45:33.233 --> 01:45:38.076]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:45:38.276 --> 01:45:47.042]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs, ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:45:47.422 --> 01:45:55.330]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:56.011]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:46:04.941 --> 01:46:09.183]  Once this, pay only 10% of the normal cost for prescription drugs.

[01:47:15.468 --> 01:47:20.731]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:47:21.011 --> 01:47:25.074]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:47:25.314 --> 01:47:29.120]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:34.026]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:47:34.086 --> 01:47:36.870]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:47:37.171 --> 01:47:40.375]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:47:40.415 --> 01:47:42.238]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:47:42.698 --> 01:47:43.498]  We're good to go.
[01:48:16.081 --> 01:48:17.623]  Big Brother is watching you.
[01:48:17.643 --> 01:48:20.187]  I don't know about you, but he ain't my big brother.
[01:48:20.207 --> 01:48:20.887]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:48:20.928 --> 01:48:22.710]  Again, thanks to Alex Jones for his special report out there in L.A.,
[01:48:30.146 --> 01:48:30.686]  We're good to go.
[01:48:56.055 --> 01:48:56.836]  In advertising.
[01:48:57.096 --> 01:49:05.062]  Anyway, let's take a call before we get to the... Great Palace, of course, is going to be joining me at the beginning of the next hour, but let's take a call.
[01:49:05.082 --> 01:49:06.323]  Brad is calling in from Illinois.
[01:49:06.744 --> 01:49:07.404]  Good afternoon, Brad.
[01:49:07.424 --> 01:49:07.884]  You're on the air.
[01:49:07.904 --> 01:49:12.168]  Yeah, I thought you were going to say fighting for truth, justice, and the American way there for a second.
[01:49:12.408 --> 01:49:14.329]  Yeah, well, that's essentially what it is.
[01:49:14.369 --> 01:49:14.890]  That's right.
[01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:24.257]  I wanted to... A few callers back, I think you were talking about this Homeland Security and Patriot Act and all the tightening down that's going on right now, but
[01:49:24.776 --> 01:49:31.300]  I wanted to let the listeners know that this tightening down stuff really started in the mid-'80s.
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:37.764]  It's just since 9-11 that everybody's got a focal point on it.
[01:49:37.804 --> 01:49:40.345]  But I remember in the mid-'80s, like 85 or 86, all the federal courts,
[01:49:44.002 --> 01:49:54.564]  And the big cities started putting in the metal detectors and the high security, and then some of the bigger cities that could afford it started putting it in all their state and city buildings.
[01:49:55.084 --> 01:50:00.045]  And this was in the 80s when things were, you know, back to the way they were normally.
[01:50:00.505 --> 01:50:04.046]  And you had to wonder, I used to ask myself, well, who are they protecting themselves from?
[01:50:04.466 --> 01:50:06.567]  There were no terrorists running around back then.
[01:50:06.887 --> 01:50:08.487]  They were protecting themselves from us.
[01:50:08.807 --> 01:50:09.767]  And, you know, that's right.
[01:50:09.807 --> 01:50:12.448]  And, you know, Brad, the thing is that, and you bring up a really good point,
[01:50:13.081 --> 01:50:23.347]  This all occurred in very subtle ways, and it was always predicated upon one lone gun nut or somebody that did something that got them.
[01:50:23.607 --> 01:50:26.749]  They were able to whip the public into a frenzy to start accepting us.
[01:50:26.789 --> 01:50:28.070]  I remember here in the Denver area.
[01:50:28.610 --> 01:50:32.113]  There was a woman that was getting a divorce, filed for the divorce.
[01:50:32.174 --> 01:50:37.558]  Her husband came into the courtroom, shot her dead, and immediately the media jumped on it.
[01:50:37.578 --> 01:50:38.399]  We've got to have this.
[01:50:38.419 --> 01:50:39.180]  We've got to have that.
[01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:44.665]  And as a result of that, they've got all these protections and securities in place for this one incident.
[01:50:45.186 --> 01:50:45.806]  But I'm like you.
[01:50:46.327 --> 01:50:47.247]  I'm not a terrorist.
[01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:51.251]  And who are these laws really construed against?
[01:50:51.732 --> 01:50:52.132]  It's us.
[01:50:52.432 --> 01:50:52.933]  Absolutely.
[01:50:52.953 --> 01:50:54.314]  And then the other thing I wanted to bring up is
[01:50:54.995 --> 01:50:57.776]  A caller back or so was talking about the paper ballots.
[01:50:58.236 --> 01:51:00.797]  You know, we all know these voting things are a sham.
[01:51:01.277 --> 01:51:14.140]  But, you know, I have to kind of agree with Lestander Spooner, the writer back in the 1800s, where he basically said that a secret ballot doesn't do anything but create a secret government.
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.421]  And I have to agree with him on that.
[01:51:16.441 --> 01:51:20.742]  I mean, I've argued with people here locally when they have these sham referendums,
[01:51:21.274 --> 01:51:21.534]  That's right.
[01:51:21.715 --> 01:51:22.555]  Absolutely.
[01:51:41.212 --> 01:51:42.974]  So that's basically all I wanted to say.
[01:51:42.995 --> 01:51:45.137]  Yeah, I enjoy your show on Saturday.
[01:51:45.157 --> 01:51:47.020]  I've never called in, but maybe some night I will.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:48.142]  Well, I appreciate it.
[01:51:48.362 --> 01:51:48.843]  Okay, bye.
[01:51:48.863 --> 01:51:49.744]  Well, keep listening, okay?
[01:51:50.345 --> 01:51:51.787]  Again, thanks, Brad, in Illinois.
[01:51:52.247 --> 01:51:56.133]  Okay, coming up, I mentioned that we have Greg Pallas joining us at the top of the hour.
[01:51:56.773 --> 01:52:13.710]  Greg is going to be talking about his investigation into Arnold Schwarzenegger, and we're going to find out about his $9 billion dirty little secret with such luminaries as Kenneth Way from Enron and Mike Milken, the convicted junk bond dealer.
[01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:15.231]  Incredible story.
[01:52:15.451 --> 01:52:15.972]  So stay tuned.
[01:52:15.992 --> 01:52:16.573]  There's more to come.
[01:52:16.653 --> 01:52:17.454]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:52:17.494 --> 01:52:17.954]  Again, the number 1-800-259-9231.
[01:52:17.994 --> 01:52:21.538]  I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones who will return on Thursday and be right back after this.
[01:52:21.558 --> 01:52:22.459]  Stay tuned.
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:55.340]  Big Brother.
[01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:56.161]  Mainstream Media.
[01:53:23.152 --> 01:53:24.233]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.893 --> 01:53:25.713]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.473 --> 01:53:27.374]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.394 --> 01:53:31.675]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.216 --> 01:53:36.317]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.018 --> 01:53:41.499]  And again, I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for the away on business Alex Jones.
[01:53:41.519 --> 01:53:48.222]  And as you've heard the last couple of days, he's been providing updates, special reports from Los Angeles covering the Arnold Schwarzenegger incident.
[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:51.481]  Devical, if you want to call it that, which it certainly is.
[01:53:51.501 --> 01:53:54.183]  It's a circus, as Alex has described.
[01:53:55.083 --> 01:53:58.885]  And the fix is in, and they just continue.
[01:53:58.945 --> 01:54:08.429]  They just keep going at trying to raid the state and rid it of the corruption, only to replace it with a much more corrupt system.
[01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:15.793]  www.infowars.com, www.infowars.com, and also www.infowars.com.
[01:54:16.286 --> 01:54:17.706]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:18.047 --> 01:54:19.607]  You must check out those websites.
[01:54:20.167 --> 01:54:24.809]  There's loads and loads of news on there to keep you up to speed on what's going on.
[01:54:24.849 --> 01:54:25.489]  It's kind of interesting.
[01:54:25.509 --> 01:54:35.392]  When Alex was talking about Schwarzenegger and his Austrian connections and his love of Hitler, there's an article on the Infowars.com website titled, The Nazis in W's Closet.
[01:54:35.772 --> 01:54:39.273]  When Adolf Hitler needed money, who did he call?
[01:54:39.853 --> 01:54:51.441]  Well, he called George Bush's granddaddy, and he was... You know, a lot of times, people don't realize what's happened in the past and how much it affects what is happening now.
[01:54:52.001 --> 01:54:58.085]  And again, you've got to stay informed, because you begin to realize, you start connecting the dots, and you start seeing where all this stuff goes.
[01:54:59.546 --> 01:55:02.108]  I interviewed a gentleman on my program on A Closer Look.
[01:55:03.369 --> 01:55:07.872]  His name is Carlo Calvi, the son of the deceased Vatican banker Roberto Calvi.
[01:55:08.633 --> 01:55:14.195]  And, you know, Calvi was big in the Vatican Bank scandal.
[01:55:14.235 --> 01:55:21.218]  Of course, the Bushes and his relative families, they seem to have a propensity for scams.
[01:55:22.059 --> 01:55:25.720]  Peter Bruton wrote an excellent book on George Bush Sr.
[01:55:26.221 --> 01:55:28.882]  and the Iran-Contra scams and all of that.
[01:55:29.362 --> 01:55:36.105]  Those people raided billions and billions and billions of dollars from innocent people in the United States from savings and loans.
[01:55:36.825 --> 01:55:55.304]  And according to Calvi, the Bush family apparently does have some leanings toward Nazism and fascism because Calvi reported a meeting between Michele Sindona, who was a mafia guy in Italy, and a guy named Phil Guarino here in the United States.
[01:55:55.344 --> 01:55:57.487]  Now, Guarino, if you do some research on Guarino...
[01:55:58.067 --> 01:55:58.387]  I think so.
[01:56:21.738 --> 01:56:35.937]  I mean, it's as obvious as the noses on our faces that what they're doing is this police state activity with Tom Ridge and the Homeland Security Act and all of these things with Poindexter, with Total Information Awareness, etc., etc.
[01:56:36.518 --> 01:56:38.000]  These guys are hell-bent.
[01:56:38.917 --> 01:56:50.489]  On completely taking away all of our liberties and robbing us of our ability to think for ourselves, to protect our families and our property, and to enslave us in a total police state.
[01:56:50.929 --> 01:56:59.338]  And what I just mentioned real quick, too, Alex Jones' latest video, Police State 3, is a must-have video that you can get by calling 1-888-
[01:57:01.536 --> 01:57:29.873]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9-8-8-8 2-5-3-3-1-3-9 or InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com Police State 3 is the subtitle is Total Enslavement and he will demonstrate how this plan of theirs is well well underway and we can't afford to be sleeping at the switcher right now because things are really reaching a critical mass the next presidential election is coming up next year it's going to be interesting to see how this all pans out but you know
[01:57:30.493 --> 01:57:43.386]  The hope is, as we've been talking on the program, the hope is that if we get informed and we know what's going on, we can use our vote and our voice to put a stop to this and end this totalitarian regime that's on the horizon.
[01:57:44.548 --> 01:57:49.633]  One other thing, too, Argentina, which Alex brought up, they're under a constitutional dictatorship.
[01:57:50.521 --> 01:57:51.621]  And that's kind of where we're going.
[01:57:51.661 --> 01:57:56.403]  John Dean of Watergate fame has written extensively on constitutional dictatorship.
[01:57:56.803 --> 01:58:01.784]  That's another thing you need to check out.
[01:58:01.804 --> 01:58:02.124]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:02.144 --> 01:58:04.305]  1-800-259-9231 is our number.
[01:58:04.345 --> 01:58:04.925]  Give us a call.
[01:58:05.325 --> 01:58:06.065]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[01:58:06.085 --> 01:58:06.405]  Stay tuned.
[01:58:06.425 --> 01:58:08.566]  There's more to come on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:08.606 --> 01:58:09.206]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:15.583 --> 01:58:19.908]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:58:20.109 --> 01:58:24.534]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:58:24.674 --> 01:58:29.040]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:30.441]  The New World Order.
[01:58:31.202 --> 01:58:31.543]  Can emerge.
[01:58:32.224 --> 01:58:36.448]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:58:36.508 --> 01:58:43.456]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:58:43.576 --> 01:58:45.579]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:58:45.959 --> 01:58:56.283]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:58:56.563 --> 01:59:01.925]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:00:18.577 --> 02:00:22.079]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[02:00:26.341 --> 02:00:32.504]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:00:32.905 --> 02:00:40.809]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:46.574]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.

[02:01:15.238 --> 02:01:20.281]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:20.641 --> 02:01:22.923]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:42.768 --> 02:01:52.054]  The following is an actual conversation between a Neocon Star operator and a subscriber in distress who is locked in her car and doesn't have the proper authorization to get out.
[02:01:52.555 --> 02:01:56.457]  With Neocon Star, help is just a satellite away.
[02:01:57.298 --> 02:02:00.860]  Neocon Star, how can I offer you great service today?
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:03.322]  Please help me, I'm trapped in my car.
[02:02:03.402 --> 02:02:05.263]  My retina scanner won't work.
[02:02:05.463 --> 02:02:06.644]  Just relax, sir.
[02:02:06.744 --> 02:02:08.465]  It's not sir, it's ma'am.
[02:02:08.565 --> 02:02:10.286]  Please hurry, it's hot in here.
[02:02:10.507 --> 02:02:12.568]  According to Admiral Poindexter's database,
[02:02:12.808 --> 02:02:15.269]  I have you at the Monsanto Mart on 2nd Street.
[02:02:15.389 --> 02:02:15.689]  Right!
[02:02:15.969 --> 02:02:20.371]  I have a live shot of you from the Neocon Star Observation Blimp in your hair reel.
[02:02:20.491 --> 02:02:21.692]  I'm an old lady!
[02:02:22.012 --> 02:02:26.174]  Alright sir, looks like you have no outstanding warrant, so you're not under vehicular detention.
[02:02:26.214 --> 02:02:30.356]  But it looks like you have some outstanding parking tickets in two counties.
[02:02:31.596 --> 02:02:35.418]  We'll need you to slide your national ID card for a deduction before we can release you.
[02:02:39.975 --> 02:02:41.136]  But I can't find it.
[02:02:41.196 --> 02:02:42.236]  I'm looking everywhere.
[02:02:42.296 --> 02:02:44.417]  I can't find my national ID card.
[02:02:44.637 --> 02:02:49.098]  Sir, I'm going to send a Homeland Security helicopter there right now to check you out.
[02:02:49.138 --> 02:02:51.899]  You have a 99.2% chance of being a terrorist.
[02:02:52.459 --> 02:02:57.241]  Would you like the in-car lethal injection right now, or would you prefer to wait for the agents?
[02:02:57.981 --> 02:02:58.501]  Okay.
[02:02:59.061 --> 02:03:01.062]  I'll take the lethal injection, please.
[02:03:01.402 --> 02:03:03.683]  Thanks for using Neocon Star.
[02:03:04.023 --> 02:03:04.723]  Have a nice day.
[02:03:07.672 --> 02:03:09.673]  This is Michael Corbin from A Closer Look.
[02:03:10.253 --> 02:03:13.034]  Does this scenario seem far-fetched or on the horizon?
[02:03:13.574 --> 02:03:22.778]  Well, we may experience this level of government control if we don't stand up today and take back our God-given freedoms that have been taken in the name of the war on terrorism.
[02:03:22.798 --> 02:03:30.001]  The number you have reached, 911, has been changed to a non-published number.
[02:03:30.281 --> 02:03:31.081]  We are the Borg.
[02:03:31.802 --> 02:03:33.062]  You will be assimilated.
[02:03:33.602 --> 02:03:34.243]  Resistance is futile.
[02:03:35.356 --> 02:03:40.017]  Yeah, right.
[02:03:40.297 --> 02:03:43.258]  Yeah, right is right.
[02:03:43.278 --> 02:03:43.738]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:03:43.758 --> 02:03:43.938]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:03:43.998 --> 02:03:48.019]  I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones, who will return on Thursday.
[02:03:48.039 --> 02:03:53.400]  And let's take a quick call, and then we're going to go to our guest, Greg Pallast.
[02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:54.860]  We've got a caller from Michigan.
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:55.420]  Good afternoon.
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:55.960]  You're on the air.
[02:03:57.180 --> 02:03:58.601]  Yes.
[02:03:59.101 --> 02:03:59.441]  Dave?
[02:03:59.601 --> 02:04:03.422]  Yes, I have this problem with Gregory Pallast.
[02:04:03.522 --> 02:04:04.082]  I think that...
[02:04:05.165 --> 02:04:07.866]  You know, he's done a lot of very, very useful work.
[02:04:07.926 --> 02:04:14.169]  He leaked the information about the W1999 document.
[02:04:14.209 --> 02:04:19.952]  He has done a lot of good things, but this is a person who has lionized Gray Davis.
[02:04:20.673 --> 02:04:27.236]  Gray Davis has done more damage to California and this country than any governor could conceivably have done.
[02:04:27.256 --> 02:04:31.158]  He's been all about eliminating the borders, basically
[02:04:32.128 --> 02:04:33.529]  But Dave, you know the thing is... Well, that's...
[02:04:55.746 --> 02:05:04.998]  I appreciate the focus on Arnold Schwarzenegger and all of his problems, but I think we need to look at who these other people are, Bustamante and Gray Davis.
[02:05:05.018 --> 02:05:06.239]  They have to be gotten rid of.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:07.881]  I can't stand to...
[02:05:09.304 --> 02:05:10.185]  Well, we'll talk to him about it.
[02:05:10.205 --> 02:05:14.328]  You know, the thing is, though, he is entitled to his opinion, and of course you are entitled to yours.
[02:05:14.468 --> 02:05:17.831]  The idea is that everybody has their particular angle and viewpoint on things.
[02:05:18.091 --> 02:05:19.352]  Well, his angle doesn't hold water.
[02:05:19.372 --> 02:05:20.473]  He has done these things, and he has... Yeah.
[02:05:33.504 --> 02:05:42.069]  Dramatically assaulted the sovereignty of this country and the rights of the people of California, and he set a precedent that will be followed for the rest of us very shortly.
[02:05:42.289 --> 02:05:43.330]  I don't know if I'd go that strong.
[02:05:43.823 --> 02:05:44.183]  Why not?
[02:05:44.463 --> 02:05:46.203]  Well, just listen to your language.
[02:05:46.223 --> 02:05:49.244]  I mean, your language makes it sound like he's a devil or something.
[02:05:49.264 --> 02:05:49.664]  He's not.
[02:05:49.684 --> 02:05:58.506]  I think that Gray Davis is, and I think that anyone that can support those things is totally against the principles of this country, and I think that should be highlighted here.
[02:05:58.826 --> 02:06:04.727]  Well, sure, and of course, if Californians get Schwarzenegger, it's going to be worse than the previous.
[02:06:05.087 --> 02:06:05.867]  I think it will be.
[02:06:05.907 --> 02:06:07.188]  I don't think it will be different.
[02:06:07.228 --> 02:06:09.668]  I think it will be the same either way.
[02:06:10.328 --> 02:06:13.189]  But I think that Gray Davis needs to be held accountable, and I think that...
[02:06:13.993 --> 02:06:17.238]  Your guest needs to be challenged on those things, and in support of Gray Davis.
[02:06:17.659 --> 02:06:18.861]  Okay, well, we'll ask him about that.
[02:06:18.901 --> 02:06:19.482]  All right, thank you.
[02:06:19.502 --> 02:06:20.504]  All right, Dave, thanks for the call.
[02:06:21.626 --> 02:06:24.069]  We're going to be getting Gray on here in just a moment.
[02:06:24.090 --> 02:06:27.956]  Real quick, to update you on what he is going to be talking about.
[02:06:30.686 --> 02:06:45.286]  Apparently he has been given documentation that discusses the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger was in a meeting on May 17, 2001 at the Peninsula Hotel in Los Angeles, which you heard Alex make reference to.
[02:06:45.346 --> 02:06:46.808]  This meeting was attended.
[02:06:47.483 --> 02:06:48.123]  We're good to go.
[02:07:08.038 --> 02:07:28.421]  Now, here's the story, and we're going to talk about it with Greg, is the story that Arnold Schwarzenegger does not want you to hear, and that is that the biggest single threat to Ken Flay and the electricity lords is a private lawsuit that was filed last year under California's unique civil code provision, 17200, which is the Unfair Business Practices Act.
[02:07:28.997 --> 02:07:39.416]  This litigation heading to trial now in Los Angeles would make the power companies return the $9 billion that they filched from California electricity and gas customers.
[02:07:40.896 --> 02:07:54.361]  Okay, so when we get Greg on, he's going to talk about this because this is a very paramount thing because if Schwarzenegger is elected, this whole thing could go away and those guys will get to keep the $9 billion that they stole out of the pockets of the Californians.
[02:07:55.021 --> 02:07:56.521]  And we're going to take a call now.
[02:07:57.141 --> 02:07:58.442]  We've got someone calling from Oklahoma.
[02:07:58.462 --> 02:07:59.202]  What was the name again?
[02:08:00.122 --> 02:08:00.343]  Ron?
[02:08:00.943 --> 02:08:01.763]  Ron, we've got you on.
[02:08:01.903 --> 02:08:02.363]  You're on the air.
[02:08:05.364 --> 02:08:07.385]  I heard you talking a minute ago about
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:08.400]  Mm-hmm.
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:09.160]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:09.560]  Yeah.
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:09.780]  Mm-hmm.
[02:08:33.584 --> 02:08:36.325]  The Reichstag fire, I'm here in Oklahoma City.
[02:08:36.665 --> 02:08:39.446]  Shortly after the bombing, I was calling it the Reichstag bombing.
[02:08:40.387 --> 02:08:54.812]  But Hitler's speech before the Reichstag, after the fire in 1933, when he called for the Enabling Act, that was almost word for word, George Bush's speech.
[02:08:54.872 --> 02:08:59.494]  Makes you kind of wonder where they're getting their material for his speeches, right?
[02:08:59.834 --> 02:09:01.275]  It was absolutely scary.
[02:09:01.455 --> 02:09:02.135]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:03.013 --> 02:09:07.954]  I've always been fascinated by World War II and read a lot about it.
[02:09:08.654 --> 02:09:12.815]  And then when these things started happening, it just struck a chord immediately.
[02:09:13.695 --> 02:09:16.376]  And everything, just lights came on.
[02:09:17.376 --> 02:09:30.899]  You know, it's interesting because one of the things that also precipitated Hitler's power, coming to power in Germany, was the fact that he used the street thugs to terrorize the citizens.
[02:09:31.479 --> 02:09:31.939]  Yes, sir.
[02:09:32.925 --> 02:09:48.153]  Yeah, and one of the things we're seeing now, a few callers back mentioned the fact that there were certain things that were occurring in the 80s that were a lot more subtle, that were kind of paving the road to where we are today.
[02:09:48.834 --> 02:09:53.036]  One of those things, too, that I observed was the proliferation of gang members.
[02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:54.521]  We're good to go.
[02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:17.147]  It makes you kind of wonder where they got their money, where they got their guns, and, you know, the drug business.
[02:10:19.089 --> 02:10:19.530]  You got it.
[02:10:20.371 --> 02:10:26.839]  Yeah, and the cops act like, well, we can't clean these guys up because there's too many of them.
[02:10:27.299 --> 02:10:49.966]  But, you know, the problem is that if they really wanted to put a stop to it, they could, but they don't because they're being told to lay off because those kinds of investigations would lead to some interesting places, as Gary Webb noted in a series of articles that he did for the San Jose Mercury News when he discovered the CIA's involvement in funding some of these gangs with drugs and weapons.
[02:10:50.546 --> 02:10:56.688]  My lady friend managed an apartment complex here in the city back in the 80s
[02:10:57.133 --> 02:10:57.233]  Yeah.
[02:10:57.253 --> 02:10:57.373]  Mm-hmm.
[02:10:57.773 --> 02:10:57.994]  Yeah.
[02:11:27.230 --> 02:11:45.507]  And see, the thing is that we're going to have street violence erupting, we're going to have violence erupting right on the streets, and what's going to happen is you're going to have the guy come riding in on a white horse, and he will take care of the problem, and then, of course, we will be beholden to him, and everybody will live happily ever after.
[02:11:46.028 --> 02:11:46.308]  Right.
[02:11:46.448 --> 02:11:51.513]  I was listening to your guest yesterday, and he was absolutely fascinating.
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:52.520]  Which one, yesterday?
[02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:53.741]  Yeah.
[02:11:53.761 --> 02:11:54.521]  Paul David Collins?
[02:11:54.742 --> 02:11:55.442]  Right, right.
[02:11:55.602 --> 02:11:57.363]  Yeah, he's done a lot of research on this stuff.
[02:11:57.403 --> 02:12:08.629]  And, you know, one of the things that when we were talking about, you know, being informed and reading books and things like that, I highly encourage the audience also, if you can get a copy of Painted Black by Carl Rashke.
[02:12:09.670 --> 02:12:12.211]  This book was written in 1990, so it's a little bit hard to get.
[02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:17.154]  But Painted Black kind of outlines the aesthetics of terror.
[02:12:17.454 --> 02:12:21.316]  Rashke, who is a comparative religion professor at DU in Denver here,
[02:12:22.213 --> 02:12:22.453]  I think so.
[02:12:47.425 --> 02:12:48.145]  Thanks for the call.
[02:12:48.205 --> 02:12:48.946]  We've got to move on.
[02:12:49.366 --> 02:12:50.586]  Coming up, we've got Greg Palast.
[02:12:50.606 --> 02:12:51.106]  So stay tuned.
[02:12:51.126 --> 02:12:51.647]  There's more to come.
[02:12:51.687 --> 02:12:52.247]  Our number today, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:12:52.267 --> 02:12:52.327]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:12:52.347 --> 02:12:52.767]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[02:12:53.187 --> 02:12:55.268]  We'll be right back with the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:15.954 --> 02:13:19.196]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[02:13:19.656 --> 02:13:21.677]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[02:13:22.037 --> 02:13:24.639]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[02:13:24.999 --> 02:13:29.541]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[02:13:29.741 --> 02:13:31.522]  But you have to act now!
[02:13:31.723 --> 02:13:37.906]  With $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I have seen in my 24 years in the business.
[02:13:38.306 --> 02:13:44.850]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[02:13:45.070 --> 02:13:48.612]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[02:13:48.852 --> 02:13:52.294]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[02:13:52.734 --> 02:13:55.015]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[02:13:55.375 --> 02:13:56.196]  Do it now.
[02:13:56.456 --> 02:14:05.801]  That's $10 collector gold coins, $10 and $20 collector gold coins, at the nearest of melt in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[02:14:05.981 --> 02:14:06.862]  800-686-2237 That's Midas at 800-686-2237
[02:14:15.138 --> 02:14:16.799]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:14:16.819 --> 02:14:19.321]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:14:43.255 --> 02:14:48.037]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[02:15:04.125 --> 02:15:05.047]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:15:14.608 --> 02:15:15.429]  Oh my God!
[02:15:15.689 --> 02:15:20.414]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:15:20.695 --> 02:15:21.375]  Yes, it's true.
[02:15:21.455 --> 02:15:24.158]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:15:24.298 --> 02:15:28.323]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[02:15:28.443 --> 02:15:28.983]  You heard it right.
[02:15:29.164 --> 02:15:34.189]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[02:15:34.309 --> 02:15:35.150]  For drugs like Phentermine,
[02:16:03.610 --> 02:16:06.751]  Ambient, Fioriset, Sama, Ultram, Viagra, and many more.
[02:16:06.991 --> 02:16:11.293]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[02:16:11.313 --> 02:16:14.374]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[02:16:16.294 --> 02:16:22.236]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[02:16:31.599 --> 02:16:32.240]  We're good to go.
[02:16:47.136 --> 02:16:47.536]  We're good to go.
[02:16:47.556 --> 02:16:48.116]  We're good to go.
[02:17:20.390 --> 02:17:22.311]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:17:22.791 --> 02:17:25.652]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:26.472 --> 02:17:29.133]  And again, filling in for Alex Jones, I'm Michael Corbin.
[02:17:29.574 --> 02:17:32.435]  Alex will return on Thursday, and our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:32.455 --> 02:17:32.975]  Again, that number is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:33.015 --> 02:17:34.575]  Now we're moving on to my guest.
[02:17:42.405 --> 02:17:46.969]  He's been called twisted by Katherine Harris in Florida.
[02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:53.354]  The White House says, we hate that, and I can't complete the sentence, but you can imagine, we hate that.
[02:17:54.095 --> 02:17:55.416]  S-O-B, I guess you could use that word.
[02:17:55.816 --> 02:18:00.541]  But anyway, and also, as you've heard, one of our callers takes exception with his stance on Gray Davis.
[02:18:00.641 --> 02:18:04.224]  But, as they say, variety is the spice of life.
[02:18:04.484 --> 02:18:07.267]  I say, controversy is the spice of life.
[02:18:08.713 --> 02:18:13.477]  It's a pleasure to welcome to the program Greg Pallast, author of The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.
[02:18:13.998 --> 02:18:15.319]  Greg, welcome to the program.
[02:18:15.439 --> 02:18:16.080]  Hey, Michael.
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:17.381]  Glad to be with you.
[02:18:17.941 --> 02:18:19.202]  Good to interview you again.
[02:18:19.222 --> 02:18:20.263]  Take your best shot.
[02:18:22.245 --> 02:18:22.525]  Yeah.
[02:18:22.745 --> 02:18:23.366]  Well, you know what?
[02:18:23.386 --> 02:18:31.472]  We're going to focus today on this discovery that you've written about, about Arnold Schwarzenegger's dirty little Enron secret.
[02:18:32.393 --> 02:18:32.734]  Right.
[02:18:32.754 --> 02:18:34.835]  I mean, it's not so secretive.
[02:18:34.875 --> 02:18:35.436]  Not anymore.
[02:18:35.556 --> 02:18:36.237]  Yeah, well, right.
[02:18:37.899 --> 02:19:00.505]  The governor there met secretly in a hotel room with Ken Lay, the mastermind of Enron, and Mike Milken, the convicted stock swindler, and a few other luminaries of the dark world.
[02:19:00.625 --> 02:19:06.067]  This is the middle of what we call the California energy crisis, the middle of the California energy crisis.
[02:19:06.545 --> 02:19:12.686]  Swindle about Ken Lay and his power company cronies ripping off the state.
[02:19:13.506 --> 02:19:23.368]  And the whole discussion was about undercutting the investigations by the state and federal government.
[02:19:23.428 --> 02:19:30.389]  Now, back in May of 2001, they didn't know who they could put up against Gray Davis as governor.
[02:19:30.789 --> 02:19:33.930]  Mainly, they were concerned about his lieutenant governor.
[02:19:34.722 --> 02:19:41.324]  A guy named Cruz Bustamante, who's actually on the ballot now, and probably the number one challenger to Schwarzenegger, should the recall win.
[02:19:41.344 --> 02:19:59.371]  He'd filed a lawsuit a month before the meeting, which was demanding $9 billion back from these power pirates, and stands a very good chance of succeeding, unless, of course, a governor of the state steps in and gets in the way, and that's kind of the...
[02:20:00.140 --> 02:20:06.383]  The purpose of the meeting to get rid of the short circuit, the lawsuit.
[02:20:06.463 --> 02:20:07.984]  And they didn't have a crystal ball.
[02:20:08.024 --> 02:20:11.165]  Some people said, I don't want people misreading what I've uncovered here.
[02:20:11.346 --> 02:20:14.347]  They're not saying, let's start a recall and put up Arnie.
[02:20:14.427 --> 02:20:22.411]  What they did is, because that was a guy named Issa that started that, but they said we have to go up against Davis, undercut him.
[02:20:22.947 --> 02:20:23.047]  Yeah.
[02:20:23.067 --> 02:20:23.247]  Go ahead.
[02:20:23.267 --> 02:20:23.567]  It's a con...
[02:20:54.211 --> 02:21:00.573]  It was part of the continuing story of the power pirates ripping off the public.
[02:21:00.593 --> 02:21:01.653]  It's still happening in Texas.
[02:21:01.753 --> 02:21:03.114]  It's happening all over the place.
[02:21:03.274 --> 02:21:04.254]  Yeah, well, it is.
[02:21:04.795 --> 02:21:18.080]  Now, given the fact that these guys, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is probably par excellence in this department, given the fact that a lot of these guys give new meaning to skeletons in the closet, let's look inside of Bustamante's closet.
[02:21:18.100 --> 02:21:18.560]  What's in there?
[02:21:19.199 --> 02:21:29.183]  Well, yeah, you know, one thing, I don't want people to get charmed, get the idea that I've fallen in love with some politicians of any party.
[02:21:29.503 --> 02:21:31.164]  God forbid, right?
[02:21:31.204 --> 02:21:32.064]  That doesn't happen.
[02:21:32.104 --> 02:21:43.048]  In fact, yesterday I was viciously, I mean, I was like, I gotta tell you, I was viciously attacked yesterday for saying unkind things about my senator, Hillary Rodham.
[02:21:44.176 --> 02:21:45.017]  Hillary the Rod.
[02:21:45.037 --> 02:21:45.517]  Yeah.
[02:21:46.437 --> 02:21:47.518]  And, you know, but what do you want me to do?
[02:21:47.558 --> 02:21:49.338]  I'm an investigative reporter, for those who don't know.
[02:21:49.379 --> 02:21:51.760]  I'm an investigative reporter for BBC television.
[02:21:51.780 --> 02:21:52.300]  Yeah.
[02:21:52.500 --> 02:22:00.023]  And for the Guardian Papers of Britain, which are probably the most influential in the world, and certainly my news program is maybe the most widely seen in the world.
[02:22:01.124 --> 02:22:04.225]  But I'm pretty much locked out of the U.S.
[02:22:04.325 --> 02:22:04.746]  media.
[02:22:04.806 --> 02:22:09.628]  I kind of bounce off the electronic wall, except when, you know, Alex Jones gives me an opening.
[02:22:09.648 --> 02:22:10.088]  Uh-huh.
[02:22:10.390 --> 02:22:14.091]  And I just, you know, I tend to go after those in power.
[02:22:14.171 --> 02:22:15.892]  That's what an investigative reporter does.
[02:22:15.912 --> 02:22:21.054]  So when the Clintons were in power, I made them very unhappy, apparently quite unhappy.
[02:22:21.154 --> 02:22:30.177]  Well, you know, I've always measured my effectiveness and success by the things that are said nasty toward me, you know, like being called an SOB.
[02:22:30.657 --> 02:22:32.117]  I tend to look at somebody and say, thank you.
[02:22:32.618 --> 02:22:33.478]  I'm doing my job.
[02:22:33.558 --> 02:22:39.740]  Yeah, you know, I mean, my other view is like, the interesting thing about Bustamante, where my problem comes in with him,
[02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:41.040]  At this moment.
[02:22:41.380 --> 02:22:43.761]  Hold that, Greg, because we'll take that when we come back from the break.
[02:22:44.141 --> 02:22:44.701]  Okay, great.
[02:22:44.721 --> 02:22:46.282]  1-800-259-9231 is our number.
[02:22:46.302 --> 02:22:46.482]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:46.542 --> 02:22:48.603]  Greg Palast is my guest.
[02:22:48.723 --> 02:22:53.184]  We're going to talk about Arnold's Enron secrets coming back from the break.
[02:22:53.584 --> 02:22:53.844]  Stay tuned.
[02:22:53.864 --> 02:22:55.225]  There's more to come on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:55.285 --> 02:22:55.925]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[02:22:55.965 --> 02:22:56.605]  We'll be right back.
[02:23:05.928 --> 02:23:06.848]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.308 --> 02:23:08.829]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.833 --> 02:23:12.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.777 --> 02:23:20.699]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the ARC Institute.
[02:23:20.799 --> 02:23:27.383]  You'll get 25 big packets of ARC's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds, plus four of their most popular bankruptcy.
[02:23:27.403 --> 02:23:31.826]  1-2-3-NoDebt.com Live debt-free now.
[02:23:32.206 --> 02:23:33.787]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[02:23:39.156 --> 02:23:45.190]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:23:45.812 --> 02:23:48.778]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:51.411 --> 02:23:59.194]  And again, I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones, who will return on Thursday, and he will be continuing the InfoWars fight.
[02:23:59.774 --> 02:24:00.194]  Our number is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:00.214 --> 02:24:00.274]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:00.294 --> 02:24:02.095]  Joining me is Greg Pallast, and we're talking about his latest article.
[02:24:02.115 --> 02:24:05.916]  Was it released yesterday, Greg, on Arnold's little secret, Enron secret?
[02:24:15.572 --> 02:24:16.252]  They come out yesterday?
[02:24:16.732 --> 02:24:22.675]  Yes, and actually over the weekend, it was Friday night that they came out.
[02:24:22.715 --> 02:24:25.536]  I just got these documents, internal Enron memos.
[02:24:25.616 --> 02:24:27.536]  It added to some material that was already out there.
[02:24:27.556 --> 02:24:39.521]  I do want to give some credit to the San Francisco Chronicle, which first learned of the secret meeting, but they didn't seem to have any information on why they would be meeting, and that required understanding, getting a little more info.
[02:24:39.681 --> 02:24:43.122]  One, the memo saying that they clearly wanted to undercut Davis,
[02:24:44.050 --> 02:24:59.493]  The other is that the state suit, which was the real threat to these guys, because California has an unusual law called the Unfair Business Practices Act, in which if you're ripped off by a series of corporations...
[02:25:00.197 --> 02:25:00.897]  You can sue.
[02:25:00.997 --> 02:25:03.138]  It's unique to that state.
[02:25:04.038 --> 02:25:05.699]  And I've done similar litigation.
[02:25:05.719 --> 02:25:13.622]  In fact, I won a case, a $4 billion case, against a company in Long Island under statutes in New York.
[02:25:14.582 --> 02:25:20.925]  And, by the way, talking about both parties being on... Well, see, there's really only one party, Michael.
[02:25:20.965 --> 02:25:25.727]  It's called what I call Hesba Shaquel, which is the party of the cash.
[02:25:26.027 --> 02:25:26.487]  Ha ha!
[02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:35.719]  And in New York, I had this little Democrat, so-called Democrat named Mario Cuomo, the great liberal hero.
[02:25:35.839 --> 02:25:37.201]  He stepped in on a case.
[02:25:37.932 --> 02:25:38.792]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:39.052 --> 02:25:41.033]  And that's one of the problems.
[02:25:41.053 --> 02:25:45.213]  So I don't want people to think that this is some type of partisan investigation.
[02:26:02.757 --> 02:26:03.517]  I got both of them.
[02:26:03.737 --> 02:26:06.858]  I mean, or I should say I am, but it's a bipartisan investigation.
[02:26:06.918 --> 02:26:18.200]  So we've got both the governator, and then we also have the capo di capi of New York Politico Democrat Cuomo doing the same.
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:19.980]  Actually, he actually did the game.
[02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:21.380]  He actually saved a company.
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:22.200]  He was in position.
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:25.101]  He saved guys from racketeering.
[02:26:25.201 --> 02:26:26.581]  These guys lost a racketeering case.
[02:26:26.621 --> 02:26:31.822]  He actually stepped into a federal case to save a group of racketeers.
[02:26:33.528 --> 02:26:40.131]  And he gave right now that our dear liberal leader, in case people wonder whatever happened to Mario Cuomo.
[02:26:40.451 --> 02:26:40.991]  Yeah.
[02:26:41.011 --> 02:26:44.153]  You know, I mean, he's a where are they now personality.
[02:26:46.894 --> 02:26:54.217]  What he's doing now, he gave a no-bid, big fat no-bid legal contract to a law firm named Wilkie Far Gallagher.
[02:26:54.417 --> 02:26:57.738]  Today, he is at Wilkie Far Gallagher.
[02:26:57.938 --> 02:27:01.660]  So I just want you, the taxpayers in New York, to know that their money went to
[02:27:02.410 --> 02:27:09.113]  Good purpose to make sure that Mario Cuomo continued to live in the style to which he'd become accustomed at your expense.
[02:27:09.353 --> 02:27:11.154]  The lap of luxury, yes.
[02:27:11.554 --> 02:27:18.657]  So I just, you know, I don't want anyone to think, well, oh, he's out to get Arnold because he's out to help the Democrats.
[02:27:19.758 --> 02:27:22.679]  No, it doesn't matter.
[02:27:23.319 --> 02:27:24.299]  It's the same game.
[02:27:24.319 --> 02:27:25.740]  Sure it is.
[02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:30.242]  But, you know, on the other hand, I have to say, Bustamante did the right thing by bringing that lawsuit together
[02:27:30.973 --> 02:27:42.581]  He seems a bit afraid of it because he certainly doesn't like to shout about it, but I think that, you know, clearly it just brought down firepower on his head, corporate money boys that really went after him.
[02:27:42.981 --> 02:27:48.925]  And don't forget, the energy crisis started under a guy named Bill Clinton.
[02:27:48.965 --> 02:27:52.908]  The year 2000 was the Clinton presidency, and Clinton...
[02:27:53.866 --> 02:28:02.730]  While Davis is drowning, Davis is getting absolutely pounded politically because the power price is rising.
[02:28:03.690 --> 02:28:08.713]  Clinton didn't act on that until December, until after the election.
[02:28:12.529 --> 02:28:13.290]  I mean, he waited.
[02:28:13.450 --> 02:28:16.992]  California's drowning, and he didn't take any action until December of that year.
[02:28:17.112 --> 02:28:20.294]  He waited until the hemorrhage was well established, and then he acted.
[02:28:20.314 --> 02:28:21.775]  Well, yeah, I mean, he didn't care.
[02:28:22.195 --> 02:28:23.636]  And you have to look at another thing.
[02:28:23.756 --> 02:28:26.298]  Uh-oh, I guess people won't like this one.
[02:28:27.159 --> 02:28:40.067]  One of the reasons seems to be a great prejudice toward power companies in the Clinton administration, which may have to do with the fact that Hillary Rodham represented one of the big, giant power companies ripping off California.
[02:28:40.831 --> 02:28:43.412]  Out of Little Rock, Arkansas, Entergy International.
[02:28:43.572 --> 02:28:44.412]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:28:44.532 --> 02:28:45.813]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:28:45.853 --> 02:28:48.273]  But, you know, I mean, I'm not saying that there's a direct connection.
[02:28:48.574 --> 02:28:50.854]  I'm not saying that the Clintons are influenced by money.
[02:28:52.075 --> 02:28:52.955]  It just looks that way.
[02:28:54.495 --> 02:28:56.476]  You know, I don't know what to tell you.
[02:28:57.176 --> 02:29:05.279]  And you can see that, by the way, in the book, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy, I don't want... That's very important that people understand that...
[02:29:06.868 --> 02:29:25.032]  I have a chapter, by the way, a new chapter, which is in the edition out now, called California Riemann, Deregulation of the Power Pirates, the real story there, and it tells about Hillary and her connections, and it tells about Enron and the connections, of course, deep into the Bush family.
[02:29:25.652 --> 02:29:34.334]  These guys have been plugged in, and I know they're plugged in, but this has been going on for a long time.
[02:29:35.066 --> 02:29:40.789]  Yeah, I mean, you have to understand, Enron was a kind of, you know, Bush creation to some extent.
[02:29:40.829 --> 02:29:43.950]  The Bush family, they grew up together politically.
[02:29:44.291 --> 02:29:52.014]  The corporation really was established in about 19... It was only established around 1986 out of Houston Natural Gas.
[02:29:52.274 --> 02:29:57.517]  And it was the creation of deregulation, which really started with Governor Bush out of Texas.
[02:29:58.314 --> 02:30:03.016]  Now, deregulation first caught on in California under Pete Wilson.
[02:30:03.036 --> 02:30:06.678]  Now, there's a Republican there, and so it mixes up under Pete Wilson.
[02:30:08.318 --> 02:30:20.784]  But these are Texas power companies, Enron, TXU, which is Texas Utilities, Reliant, which is the alias for Houston Industries, Southern Company, Entergy, Hillary's Company.
[02:30:21.924 --> 02:30:22.464]  These guys...
[02:30:24.747 --> 02:30:24.887]  Right.
[02:30:46.466 --> 02:30:48.027]  Who is, by the way, now our ally.
[02:30:48.047 --> 02:31:05.673]  Hey, as soon as I, you know, don't get, I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea, just because I said someone's a berserker with a weapon of, the guy has nuclear, we don't need to send in inspectors, you know, in Pakistan, because the guy, the dictator there exploded his bomb on national television.
[02:31:06.253 --> 02:31:06.913]  So, you know, it's like,
[02:31:07.904 --> 02:31:12.906]  So, you have to understand, these power pirates have been operating worldwide.
[02:31:12.946 --> 02:31:16.047]  They didn't just show up in California one day.
[02:31:16.167 --> 02:31:26.370]  They started out in Texas, but then they moved to England, Brazil, Pakistan, leaving broken bones and bought-off politicians in their wake, and then they ended up in California.
[02:31:26.670 --> 02:31:27.690]  In empty piggy banks.
[02:31:27.850 --> 02:31:28.351]  That's right.
[02:31:28.371 --> 02:31:29.331]  And so they picked up, you know...
[02:31:29.935 --> 02:31:32.737]  To them, you know, Schwarzenegger was not, I wouldn't say, their creation.
[02:31:32.957 --> 02:31:38.160]  They just jumped on, grabbed on, and funded the Frankenstein.
[02:31:38.660 --> 02:31:47.025]  I say, you know, in this whole equation, he's probably a bit player that, you know, he's a bit player, and he's willing to roll over for cash.
[02:31:47.365 --> 02:31:48.866]  Well, his lines are all scripted.
[02:31:48.966 --> 02:31:57.571]  He seems to believe this stuff, you know, but on the other hand, it's very clear when he's not scripted that he doesn't quite know what to do.
[02:31:57.651 --> 02:31:58.972]  And, you know, people are voting...
[02:31:59.551 --> 02:32:03.393]  I seem to be attracted to this guy because they see this larger-than-life guy on the screen.
[02:32:03.413 --> 02:32:06.274]  Well, if you like fictional characters, then why don't you write in Spider-Man?
[02:32:07.055 --> 02:32:07.915]  Or Mickey Mouse.
[02:32:07.975 --> 02:32:08.875]  He's never been in a trailer.
[02:32:08.895 --> 02:32:12.097]  He's never touched anyone's behind except for this web, and then it's only the bad guy.
[02:32:13.618 --> 02:32:15.419]  Now, let's talk about this.
[02:32:16.079 --> 02:32:25.743]  After they've looted or robbed the consumers in California of $9 billion, how does Arnold fit into this equation and Bustamante, and what are the dynamics of this game?
[02:32:25.864 --> 02:32:27.004]  It gets really complicated.
[02:32:27.044 --> 02:32:28.785]  All our schemes tend to be kind of complicated.
[02:32:29.906 --> 02:32:35.813]  They've got a problem in that Enron, because it imploded, all this garbage came out.
[02:32:35.833 --> 02:32:39.538]  In fact, you don't have to be a great investigative reporter to get some of this stuff.
[02:32:39.638 --> 02:32:44.464]  The bankruptcy courts have required that internal Enron documents be posted on the web.
[02:32:45.006 --> 02:32:45.246]  Really?
[02:32:45.847 --> 02:32:46.847]  Out of Texas, that's right.
[02:32:47.428 --> 02:32:53.572]  And what you'll find is that all the games and schemes are laid bare.
[02:32:55.213 --> 02:32:56.994]  They would falsely schedule power.
[02:32:57.054 --> 02:33:01.958]  They had these colorful names for playing the market, like Get Shorty and Death Star.
[02:33:02.578 --> 02:33:03.919]  But basically they would...
[02:33:05.541 --> 02:33:05.701]  Right.
[02:33:05.721 --> 02:33:06.182]  Right.
[02:33:29.611 --> 02:33:36.895]  The power plants would shut down, and they'd sell the big electricity from their other plants and make a killing in a single day.
[02:33:37.115 --> 02:33:39.696]  You know that big blackout they had in California a couple of years ago?
[02:33:39.716 --> 02:33:39.896]  Yeah.
[02:33:39.936 --> 02:33:41.457]  Was that somehow related to this, maybe?
[02:33:41.477 --> 02:33:41.857]  Absolutely.
[02:33:41.917 --> 02:33:45.419]  It was 100% related to it, because what they were doing is that they were playing games with the market.
[02:33:45.439 --> 02:33:52.442]  For example, in one case, Enron Corporation sold 500 megawatts of power.
[02:33:52.482 --> 02:33:54.143]  That's a huge amount of power.
[02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:55.551]  Right.
[02:33:56.091 --> 02:33:57.452]  Which they said, which they bid.
[02:33:57.492 --> 02:34:00.974]  They had this goofy bidding system, which was like the fixed casino.
[02:34:01.214 --> 02:34:02.856]  But they had this goofy bidding system.
[02:34:03.036 --> 02:34:06.838]  Enron wins the bid to send 500 megawatts of power into California.
[02:34:07.279 --> 02:34:13.002]  But it goes over a line that can only handle 15, 1.5 megawatts of power.
[02:34:13.063 --> 02:34:18.606]  Now, if you try to pour a gallon of gasoline into a thimble, it's going to go all over the place.
[02:34:18.746 --> 02:34:18.987]  Right.
[02:34:19.407 --> 02:34:20.187]  And it doesn't work.
[02:34:20.828 --> 02:34:23.750]  So the power engineers in California said, oh, my God!
[02:34:24.551 --> 02:34:27.873]  If that stuff goes over the line, one, the lines will evaporate.
[02:34:28.333 --> 02:34:30.074]  Literally, they'll vaporize if you do that.
[02:34:30.855 --> 02:34:33.336]  Or at least they'll trip and everything will go dark.
[02:34:33.396 --> 02:34:35.377]  So we can't get the power there.
[02:34:35.397 --> 02:34:41.101]  So we better, we'll pay anything, absolutely anything to get power in from other sources.
[02:34:41.621 --> 02:34:44.403]  And prices went up 10,000% in an hour.
[02:34:45.483 --> 02:34:48.585]  And of course, Enron and their cronies were there to sell it to them.
[02:34:49.245 --> 02:34:50.586]  That's the type of games that were played.
[02:34:50.606 --> 02:34:53.528]  And when they played it one too many times, what happened was that
[02:34:54.375 --> 02:34:55.476]  We used to have an old system.
[02:34:55.496 --> 02:34:56.277]  It was regulated.
[02:34:56.757 --> 02:34:58.158]  People complained about regulation.
[02:34:58.198 --> 02:35:04.563]  But, you know, basically you had a bunch of engineers that would say, we need so much electricity over here from those plants over there.
[02:35:04.944 --> 02:35:13.250]  This time it's like these wacky bidding systems, and these guys knew that you couldn't get, you know, you can't run power in two directions at the same time.
[02:35:13.290 --> 02:35:21.217]  You can't, you know, and they would figure out the physical glitches in the system until it finally, you know, a few times it just went kablooey.
[02:35:21.457 --> 02:35:21.677]  Yeah.
[02:35:23.650 --> 02:35:24.090]  Let me do this.
[02:35:24.131 --> 02:35:26.252]  Our wires are burning up here.
[02:35:26.332 --> 02:35:28.995]  Julie from Ohio would like to get on here.
[02:35:29.195 --> 02:35:29.955]  Good afternoon, Julie.
[02:35:29.975 --> 02:35:31.457]  You're on with my guest, Greg Pallast.
[02:35:31.477 --> 02:35:32.497]  Hi, Greg.
[02:35:32.538 --> 02:35:33.278]  I'm in Rhode Island.
[02:35:33.298 --> 02:35:36.060]  I've actually heard you on Jack Blood's show at WARL.
[02:35:36.421 --> 02:35:37.001]  Oh, great.
[02:35:37.842 --> 02:35:41.405]  You had a good interview there, and I haven't looked up your book yet, but I will.
[02:35:41.425 --> 02:35:43.367]  You sound like a fascinating person.
[02:35:43.387 --> 02:35:49.652]  And please continue to tell us the truth and uncover all this stuff, because we peons like to know what's going on.
[02:35:50.171 --> 02:35:52.033]  Well, you're not a peon.
[02:35:52.053 --> 02:35:52.853]  You're still a voter.
[02:35:52.893 --> 02:35:56.737]  Until they computerize the voting systems, your votes still count.
[02:35:56.757 --> 02:35:57.558]  That's coming soon.
[02:35:58.278 --> 02:36:01.401]  I just want to make a quick announcement, and I'll get off the line.
[02:36:01.741 --> 02:36:08.187]  It has nothing to do with Greg or anything like that, but tonight in Rhode Island, in Providence at the City Hall,
[02:36:09.302 --> 02:36:13.223]  People are going to come out and repeal the Patriot Act in Providence.
[02:36:13.443 --> 02:36:13.904]  Wonderful!
[02:36:13.924 --> 02:36:18.185]  Well, then that means that they're real patriots in Providence.
[02:36:18.665 --> 02:36:21.506]  Well, you know, we're trying to do what we can.
[02:36:21.546 --> 02:36:24.867]  As I try to explain to people, I'm a mother of three.
[02:36:25.387 --> 02:36:27.808]  Your baby doesn't come out running out of you.
[02:36:28.208 --> 02:36:30.409]  You have to teach it how to walk and take baby steps.
[02:36:31.044 --> 02:36:36.927]  So hopefully four states and 400 cities have done this, and hopefully the federal government will get the idea.
[02:36:37.447 --> 02:36:37.747]  That's right.
[02:36:38.167 --> 02:36:42.229]  And on InfoWars.com, by the way, too, there's another city that's getting ready to do it.
[02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:43.990]  So it's starting to catch on.
[02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:45.250]  I think people are starting to see.
[02:36:45.270 --> 02:36:48.491]  They're peeling back the veil, and they're seeing that there's a monster back there.
[02:36:49.032 --> 02:36:54.374]  Yeah, well, in fact, actually one thing you'll find out in my book, because I have, as Alex has noted...
[02:36:55.247 --> 02:37:04.071]  In fact, today, Michael Morris' film comes out about the connection between the Bush and the bin Laden family, which is triggered by my research for BBC television.
[02:37:04.991 --> 02:37:09.213]  And I just, in fact, won an award for that this week from something called Project Censored.
[02:37:09.233 --> 02:37:19.538]  The California State University's journalism school gives out awards for the most important stories not reported in the United States about the connection between the Bushes and the bin Ladens.
[02:37:19.818 --> 02:37:21.338]  But here's a good connection for you.
[02:37:21.659 --> 02:37:24.680]  The firm that did that computer fix
[02:37:25.288 --> 02:37:25.949]  Is that Choice Point?
[02:37:25.989 --> 02:37:27.069]  Choice Point out of Atlanta.
[02:37:27.129 --> 02:37:27.710]  And these guys are...
[02:37:50.584 --> 02:37:51.565]  Are raking it in.
[02:37:52.045 --> 02:38:02.993]  And by the way, remember there was all those headlines last month which seemed to have just kind of drifted away about this guy Grasso at the New York Stock Exchange given a salary of $160 million.
[02:38:04.294 --> 02:38:05.455]  But no one asked why.
[02:38:05.495 --> 02:38:07.397]  They just said it was obscene.
[02:38:07.757 --> 02:38:09.658]  But what was the point of the obscenity?
[02:38:09.698 --> 02:38:15.583]  The obscenity was proposed by a board member of the exchange named Ken Langone.
[02:38:16.163 --> 02:38:18.665]  Langone was the guy who was being charged
[02:38:19.289 --> 02:38:21.150]  With securities fraud.
[02:38:22.130 --> 02:38:26.051]  And giving money to his crony Grasso was a way of protecting himself.
[02:38:26.091 --> 02:38:26.991]  Who is Langone?
[02:38:28.352 --> 02:38:30.112]  His company is Choice Point.
[02:38:30.192 --> 02:38:33.353]  His company is the company that's the big winner.
[02:38:33.453 --> 02:38:39.735]  And the term big winner in the war on terror I got from Forbes magazine.
[02:38:39.755 --> 02:38:41.296]  They say, who's the big winner in the war on terror?
[02:38:41.336 --> 02:38:41.936]  Choice Point.
[02:38:43.285 --> 02:38:45.066]  These are the guys that fixed the election.
[02:38:45.306 --> 02:38:47.866]  These are the guys that are fixing the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:38:48.106 --> 02:38:51.587]  These are the guys that have records on Americans.
[02:38:52.947 --> 02:38:54.468]  And that's one question I have for you.
[02:38:54.528 --> 02:38:56.528]  When did we become the suspects?
[02:38:56.768 --> 02:38:59.849]  We had 19 hijackers, not one American citizen.
[02:39:00.129 --> 02:39:02.950]  Why are American citizens on the suspect list?
[02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:04.350]  We're all suffering for it, too.
[02:39:04.970 --> 02:39:05.390]  Let's move on.
[02:39:05.410 --> 02:39:07.691]  We've got a caller, Jeff, calling in from Texas.
[02:39:07.711 --> 02:39:08.411]  Good afternoon, Jeff.
[02:39:08.431 --> 02:39:09.151]  You're on with my guest.
[02:39:10.038 --> 02:39:10.418]  Hey, guys.
[02:39:10.458 --> 02:39:11.619]  You guys are doing a great job today.
[02:39:11.639 --> 02:39:12.279]  I appreciate it.
[02:39:12.579 --> 02:39:13.000]  Thanks, Jeff.
[02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:21.324]  Listen, I'm calling from Austin, Texas, and I know Alex, and I have a cable television show just like he does.
[02:39:22.264 --> 02:39:24.886]  And I know you're going to be in for the Green Festival this weekend.
[02:39:24.906 --> 02:39:26.426]  I know you're speaking on Sunday.
[02:39:26.507 --> 02:39:29.288]  I'll be in Saturday night through Monday morning in Austin.
[02:39:30.243 --> 02:39:31.744]  Oh, well, that's what I was going to ask you.
[02:39:31.824 --> 02:39:40.589]  Our show is live on Monday night, so maybe you could... You better call my office and not hang up poor Michael here with that request, okay?
[02:39:41.149 --> 02:39:42.550]  Always, it says contact Greg.
[02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:53.816]  Anyone can, by the way, go to gregpalace.com and see these nasty BBC television programs that are just too difficult to show on American TV or read this material.
[02:39:53.916 --> 02:39:57.038]  Obviously, you can read the book, but it does have a contact, Greg,
[02:39:58.283 --> 02:40:02.006]  So if you have some comments, please do that.
[02:40:02.986 --> 02:40:03.807]  I will do that today.
[02:40:04.227 --> 02:40:05.628]  Also, I wanted to ask you just real quick.
[02:40:05.669 --> 02:40:06.549]  It's kind of off-subject.
[02:40:06.990 --> 02:40:07.410]  Make it quick.
[02:40:07.450 --> 02:40:08.411]  We've got about 30 seconds.
[02:40:09.251 --> 02:40:12.894]  How did you get a hold of that document, W1999I?
[02:40:12.914 --> 02:40:14.636]  And I'll hang up and listen now.
[02:40:14.956 --> 02:40:15.416]  Okay.
[02:40:15.817 --> 02:40:17.478]  I guess people are wondering what that is.
[02:40:17.858 --> 02:40:18.859]  Document 199I.
[02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:24.181]  And that's a designation for national security.
[02:40:24.241 --> 02:40:29.022]  The secret FBI document, which I've published at least a hunk of it in my book.
[02:40:30.083 --> 02:40:32.503]  I want to get all of it up on my website.
[02:40:33.044 --> 02:40:47.548]  But it is a document which indicates that there was a prior request to investigate two members of the Bin Laden family in the U.S., and FBI agents were not released to do so until September 13, 2001.
[02:40:51.133 --> 02:41:00.516]  And that document was dropped on BBC television researchers by disgruntled agents.
[02:41:00.536 --> 02:41:02.237]  Well, I can't really say that's exactly what happened.
[02:41:02.257 --> 02:41:03.397]  Here's exactly what happened.
[02:41:03.877 --> 02:41:11.940]  Agents came in to talk to our team, and they said, ask some dumb questions about I don't know what the heck.
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:13.080]  Greg, can I interrupt you?
[02:41:13.100 --> 02:41:13.900]  We've got to take a break.
[02:41:14.140 --> 02:41:14.540]  Okay.
[02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:16.481]  I'm going to work you over for the last part, okay?
[02:41:18.077 --> 02:41:20.001]  All right.
[02:41:20.021 --> 02:41:20.161]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:41:20.221 --> 02:41:21.203]  Greg Palast is my guest.
[02:41:21.223 --> 02:41:23.286]  We'll return in just a moment on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:23.326 --> 02:41:24.027]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[02:41:24.348 --> 02:41:24.889]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:36.553 --> 02:41:40.898]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:41.079 --> 02:41:45.504]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.664 --> 02:41:50.030]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:41:50.090 --> 02:41:51.411]  The New World Order.
[02:41:51.932 --> 02:41:52.533]  Can emerge.
[02:41:53.214 --> 02:41:57.418]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:57.498 --> 02:42:04.426]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:04.566 --> 02:42:06.569]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:06.929 --> 02:42:17.275]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:17.555 --> 02:42:22.898]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:42:23.419 --> 02:42:26.060]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:42:26.180 --> 02:42:27.341]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:27.361 --> 02:42:27.821]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:27.901 --> 02:42:29.642]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:42:36.018 --> 02:42:36.458]  We're good to go.
[02:43:06.181 --> 02:43:07.121]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:43:35.859 --> 02:43:38.161]  Hi, my name is Donald from thegoldenanswer.com.

[02:44:50.767 --> 02:44:57.108]  We're on the home stretch here of the Alex Jones Show for today.
[02:44:57.629 --> 02:44:58.689]  Greg Palast is my guest.
[02:44:59.089 --> 02:45:06.491]  Greg, I want to ask you real quick, if I could, what happens here if Arnold is elected governor in Florida with this $9 billion problem?
[02:45:06.691 --> 02:45:09.472]  Well, I think he'll be elected in California this time, Florida next time.
[02:45:10.792 --> 02:45:11.333]  You said Florida.
[02:45:12.594 --> 02:45:21.643]  If Arnold is elected governor, what happens is that he's assented to this idea of undercutting the investigations.
[02:45:21.703 --> 02:45:27.248]  The state has demanded $9 billion from the Bush administration.
[02:45:27.288 --> 02:45:32.954]  That is, that the Bush administration order the power pirates to return the $9 billion that they stole.
[02:45:33.723 --> 02:45:37.485]  The federal government realizing that, in fact, that's their job.
[02:45:39.046 --> 02:45:41.507]  What's called the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
[02:45:41.927 --> 02:45:43.928]  Its job is to be the police.
[02:45:45.389 --> 02:46:01.276]  They've got the evidence on these guys, but rather than simply demand that they return the money, the feds have said under Bush's guise, and by the way, the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a guy named Woods, was personally proposed to Bush by Ken Lay.
[02:46:01.296 --> 02:46:02.417]  So Woods
[02:46:03.089 --> 02:46:03.469]  That's it.
[02:46:03.509 --> 02:46:03.689]  Geez!
[02:46:28.081 --> 02:46:31.684]  Saying this will not stand and let the court case go ahead.
[02:46:31.824 --> 02:46:37.770]  If otherwise, what happens is the judge in California in the civil litigation...
[02:46:38.522 --> 02:46:40.283]  I know it's complicated, but that's how these things work.
[02:46:40.503 --> 02:46:50.366]  And the civil litigation won't have much choice but to say, the federal government has stepped in, the elected governor of the state has no complaint, case dismissed.
[02:46:50.426 --> 02:46:52.527]  I think that that's the way it's heading.
[02:46:52.667 --> 02:46:53.927]  And that's the danger.
[02:46:53.947 --> 02:46:59.149]  I've tried to reach Arnold to say whether he's really going to go along with this scheme.
[02:47:00.490 --> 02:47:07.072]  And the only thing that happened is that some woman confronted him with my article and said, are you in bed with Ken Lay?
[02:47:08.315 --> 02:47:15.137]  And his response was, well, literally, I'm not making this up, he did this at Bakersfield Saturday.
[02:47:15.817 --> 02:47:18.297]  Well, I wasn't in bed with you.
[02:47:19.938 --> 02:47:20.518]  Obviously.
[02:47:20.538 --> 02:47:27.159]  So, you know, that's the answer so far.
[02:47:27.579 --> 02:47:29.480]  But, you know, we'll see what happens.
[02:47:30.742 --> 02:47:34.985]  I don't think there's much chance of getting back the $9 billion then, as a practical matter.
[02:47:36.606 --> 02:47:43.571]  The Ken Lays guys in there at the federal level with Bush's approval, they'll have the governorship of California.
[02:47:44.461 --> 02:47:49.105]  And Bustamante also, don't forget, Bustamante is a politician like anyone else.
[02:47:49.145 --> 02:47:54.368]  He sees which way the wind blows, and he might just scamper away and say, well, it's not worth fighting anyway.
[02:47:54.629 --> 02:47:54.869]  Yeah.
[02:47:54.889 --> 02:47:55.129]  You know?
[02:47:55.369 --> 02:47:59.792]  It just keeps on going, and it will keep on going until people start putting their foot down and saying, no more.
[02:48:00.133 --> 02:48:01.113]  No more, exactly.
[02:48:01.233 --> 02:48:04.235]  And like I say, you have to say no more, not just the Republicans.
[02:48:04.296 --> 02:48:06.657]  It's not just the Schwarzeneggers.
[02:48:06.717 --> 02:48:08.559]  It's the Cuomos of this planet, too.
[02:48:08.959 --> 02:48:10.060]  And when we...
[02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:11.101]  Absolutely.
[02:48:11.261 --> 02:48:11.681]  Absolutely.
[02:48:32.873 --> 02:48:33.575]  Greg, we're out of time.
[02:48:34.056 --> 02:48:35.279]  Okay, well, great, Michael.
[02:48:35.319 --> 02:48:36.822]  I'm really glad to be with you.
[02:48:37.063 --> 02:48:37.604]  Well, same here.
[02:48:37.624 --> 02:48:42.435]  And thank you very much for coming on the program and informing us about this whole debacle in California.
[02:48:42.456 --> 02:48:42.917]  It's interesting.
[02:48:43.879 --> 02:48:44.480]  We'll be in touch.
[02:48:45.020 --> 02:48:45.980]  Again, that was Greg Palast.
[02:48:46.020 --> 02:48:49.603]  His website is www.gregpalast.com.
[02:48:50.243 --> 02:48:51.764]  And that's it for us today.
[02:48:51.904 --> 02:48:55.426]  I will see you tomorrow in for Alex Jones, who will return on Thursday.
[02:48:56.086 --> 02:48:58.868]  And I've got an interesting lineup for you tomorrow as well.
[02:48:58.888 --> 02:49:03.731]  We're going to kind of look more closely at the aesthetics of terror.
[02:49:03.771 --> 02:49:09.334]  James Rothstein is going to join me on the program to talk about some of the stuff that he did as a retired New York City police detective.
[02:49:10.174 --> 02:49:12.516]  And working on the Son of Sam case, among other things.
[02:49:12.576 --> 02:49:15.098]  And we're going to look at how those things relate to today.
[02:49:15.878 --> 02:49:16.499]  That's it for us.
[02:49:17.099 --> 02:49:17.679]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:18.420]  Good day.
