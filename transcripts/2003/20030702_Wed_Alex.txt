[00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.261]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.124 --> 00:00:15.785]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.445 --> 00:00:17.586]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:19.346]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.807]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.547 --> 00:00:22.308]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:31.353]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:52.877]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's already Wednesday, the 2nd of July, 2003.
[00:00:54.278 --> 00:00:57.540]  I'm launching straight into the news and information today.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.261]  Pro-life women shift to the majority.
[00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:12.407]  Well, they've always been the majority, but it doesn't matter if the majority of people are against abortion or if the majority of people are for abortion.
[00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:13.507]  It doesn't matter.
[00:01:13.647 --> 00:01:16.649]  In a constitutional republic...
[00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:24.384]  With a rule of law, the minority is protected as well as the majority.
[00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:28.184]  But we always see these articles about what the majority wants.
[00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:32.645]  The majority wanted to keep black people as slaves.
[00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:33.506]  Would we do it?
[00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:42.168]  The majority wanted to arrest Jews and take them away to homeland security centers.
[00:01:42.788 --> 00:01:43.688]  Would we do it?
[00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:51.146]  Well, now the majority is being trained that homeschoolers and Christians and gun owners should be arrested.
[00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:53.408]  We have FEMA on tape, people.
[00:01:53.728 --> 00:02:00.353]  They're teaching this concentration camp mindset all over the country right now to your police.
[00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:12.624]  So my point here is that babies are human beings in the womb as much as they are out of the womb, and they all say, oh, look, will there be a shift for...
[00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:14.571]  We're good to go.
[00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:15.412]  We're good to go.
[00:02:27.938 --> 00:02:28.438]  We're good to go.
[00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:08.226]  This most heinous of practices, the killing of the young, 50-plus million of them in this country alone, and the U.N., of course, out-promoting it worldwide and Bush signing on to it.
[00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:09.907]  So that's coming up.
[00:03:10.587 --> 00:03:15.709]  Talking about the culture of death, half of Swiss deaths dubbed suicide.
[00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.012]  Half of Swiss deaths dubbed suicide.
[00:03:22.132 --> 00:03:25.714]  Half of their deaths, and it's assisted suicide.
[00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:30.499]  It's now happening in this country as well, as Wesley Smith at the Wall Street Journal has documented.
[00:03:49.014 --> 00:03:50.014]  Big news story.
[00:03:50.155 --> 00:03:50.455]  U.S.
[00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:52.655]  develops urban surveillance system.
[00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:55.216]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:59.058]  It's the Total Information Awareness Network that got into a lot of trouble.
[00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:01.679]  Now it's known as Operation Talon.
[00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:12.503]  Now in operation via the reincarnated Total Information Awareness Network slash TIPS program known as Talon.
[00:04:13.423 --> 00:04:18.085]  Well, I have the DARPA report and we're posting it on InfoWars.com and
[00:04:18.703 --> 00:04:22.826]  This is the Associated Press, Michael J. Sniffin.
[00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:49.419]  And I'll cover that when we get back and then go over the information pamphlet.
[00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:57.527]  Board Agency Announcement 03-15 BAA Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA.
[00:04:58.388 --> 00:04:59.790]  And just a bunch of other news.
[00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.033]  Defense Department tied into radical Muslim groups.
[00:05:03.093 --> 00:05:04.074]  Of course they are.
[00:05:04.815 --> 00:05:06.537]  Running the terror control system.
[00:05:06.557 --> 00:05:07.237]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:07.257 --> 00:05:07.658]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.248 --> 00:05:10.649]  We're good to go.
[00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:25.388]  The book,
[00:05:52.353 --> 00:05:57.015]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[00:05:57.255 --> 00:06:01.177]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the ARC Institute.

[00:06:19.488 --> 00:06:23.871]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.

[00:08:14.844 --> 00:08:15.505]  Big Brother.
[00:08:16.165 --> 00:08:17.206]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.927 --> 00:08:19.028]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.688 --> 00:08:20.509]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.171]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:26.494]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.015 --> 00:08:31.118]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:40.567 --> 00:08:41.908]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.086]  So, they're just calling it Operation Talon.
[00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:18.317]  And they're calling the different operations they're running just by new names.
[00:09:19.678 --> 00:09:27.085]  But I wanted to read to you out of the Associated Press what they have to say about this system.
[00:09:27.145 --> 00:09:31.350]  It's already been deployed against you and your family, put in over the last decade.
[00:09:32.771 --> 00:09:33.171]  U.S.
[00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:35.714]  develops urban surveillance systems.
[00:09:36.593 --> 00:09:56.888]  The Pentagon is developing an urban surveillance system that would use computers and thousands of cameras to track, record, and analyze the movement of every vehicle in a foreign city, dubbed combat zones that see the project is designed to help the U.S.
[00:09:56.908 --> 00:10:00.431]  military protect troops and fight in cities overseas.
[00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:09.225]  Police scientists and privacy experts say the unclassified technology could easily be adapted to spy on Americans.
[00:10:09.665 --> 00:10:22.351]  The project's centerpiece is groundbreaking computer software that is capable of automatically identifying vehicles by size, color, shape, and license tag, or drivers and passengers by face.
[00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:24.872]  Now, hold your horses right there.
[00:10:24.952 --> 00:10:26.353]  Everybody, let's just stop right there.
[00:10:28.803 --> 00:10:52.345]  If you type in Total Information Awareness Network into a search engine, you will pull up tens of thousands of links, thousands of mainstream news stories, official DARPA press conferences, C-SPAN video clips where they say,
[00:10:53.223 --> 00:11:01.926]  That the Total Information Awareness Network is to watch every citizen, to scan your face, to scan your license plate, to track your movements.
[00:11:02.006 --> 00:11:14.390]  They say to even know your brain activity, they're already mounting in the airports NASA brain scanning systems, face scanning cameras on rural roads already going in.
[00:11:15.885 --> 00:11:23.111]  Systems that scan your license plates, going in from San Antonio, Texas, to Des Moines, Iowa, to Indiana.
[00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:24.793]  We've got all the news articles.
[00:11:24.873 --> 00:11:37.404]  They said, Admiral Poindexter, the convicted felon who runs it, said, we're going to watch you, we're going to listen to every call you make, every fax you send, every email you send, every radio show.
[00:11:37.444 --> 00:11:41.628]  We're going to track everything with the Echelon computers.
[00:11:45.177 --> 00:11:51.860]  There was massive backlash against it, and so they went, okay, it's not the Total Information Awareness Network.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.921]  It's the Terrorism Information Network.
[00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.962]  Okay, it's not the TIPS program.
[00:11:58.582 --> 00:12:00.383]  It's the Talon program.
[00:12:01.063 --> 00:12:01.583]  Okay.
[00:12:02.524 --> 00:12:04.684]  And then they say, this is for overseas.
[00:12:04.764 --> 00:12:09.726]  In fact, they say in this lengthy four-page AP article, but I have the actual DARPA report here.
[00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:10.987]  It's about 40 pages long.
[00:12:11.007 --> 00:12:13.848]  You can read it at prisonplanet.com.
[00:12:15.097 --> 00:12:15.457]  I don't think so.
[00:12:40.973 --> 00:12:44.818]  To have face-scanning cameras everywhere, to scan their cars or license plates.
[00:12:45.158 --> 00:12:46.560]  This is how we occupy.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:54.071]  In fact, the Defense Department, there's a quote by a general in one of the articles here where he says we will impose our will on whoever we wish.
[00:12:54.151 --> 00:12:55.913]  We will occupy countries.
[00:12:55.933 --> 00:12:57.616]  We will dominate populations.
[00:12:59.017 --> 00:13:01.579]  And they've already put the system in here, folks.
[00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:03.440]  You go read what DARPA's saying.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.342]  Oh, it's for overseas, for the occupied, conquered lands.
[00:13:07.702 --> 00:13:11.144]  And then you look at where it's been tested and put in place and being used.
[00:13:12.705 --> 00:13:16.047]  There are now hundreds of towns and cities with face-scanning cameras.
[00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:18.989]  They're putting them up on side roads.
[00:13:19.169 --> 00:13:28.074]  Austin, Texas, I remember five years ago, 1998, I have the Austin American Statesman front-page article saying,
[00:13:29.293 --> 00:13:45.708]  With photographs of it in Police State 2000, where they say that hundreds of thousands of dollars, $840,000 a year, and it's been funded now for the last five years, of microphones are being put up in Austin.
[00:13:46.348 --> 00:13:48.250]  Thousands of microphones.
[00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:56.615]  Thousands of microphones, and now at least a thousand cameras, and guess who runs the program?
[00:13:57.015 --> 00:14:01.318]  Five years ago, guess what the statesman says?
[00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:02.879]  DARPA!
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:04.721]  DARPA!
[00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:06.482]  DARPA!
[00:14:08.143 --> 00:14:16.649]  You see, we are occupied people, and they're telling us, we want to get rid of posse comitatus, we want the troops on the streets for your safety, to protect you from terrorists.
[00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:21.574]  It was all being set up long before 9-1-1, people.
[00:14:22.975 --> 00:14:23.955]  They were training the troops.
[00:14:23.995 --> 00:14:24.816]  The terror is coming.
[00:14:24.836 --> 00:14:25.917]  They're going to take the rights.
[00:14:26.457 --> 00:14:28.179]  There's going to be biological releases.
[00:14:28.219 --> 00:14:30.560]  We're going to have to confiscate the guns so there's not rioting.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.742]  We're going to have to have forced inoculations.
[00:14:33.503 --> 00:14:35.344]  And now they've passed the laws to do it.
[00:14:36.065 --> 00:14:39.487]  But again, these laws, you can say that all black people are slaves.
[00:14:40.228 --> 00:14:41.769]  You can say that abortion is good.
[00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:44.371]  You can say anything you want to say.
[00:14:46.005 --> 00:14:53.889]  It doesn't mean that it is, in accordance with the Bill of Rights or Constitution, basic human dignity.
[00:14:54.349 --> 00:15:01.332]  You know, Hitler said that it was legal and lawful to kill people he didn't like, but we all know that he was a crook, a criminal, a murderer.
[00:15:03.893 --> 00:15:06.915]  Mao Zedong said it was, you know, he was the official government.
[00:15:06.935 --> 00:15:08.195]  He's going to kill 50 million of you.
[00:15:08.515 --> 00:15:10.856]  He's going to take you off your farms and force you into co-ops.
[00:15:11.177 --> 00:15:14.098]  He's going to take all your kids from you at age five, put them in the dormitories.
[00:15:14.662 --> 00:15:16.744]  To be little brainwashed servants of the secret police.
[00:15:18.044 --> 00:15:19.786]  Does that make it okay?
[00:15:20.446 --> 00:15:21.667]  Does that make it legitimate?
[00:15:23.448 --> 00:15:31.794]  So they say they're taking care of us, and they try to tell us, we're going to watch everything you do and track and trace, and people go, well, wait a minute, we have a Fourth Amendment.
[00:15:31.814 --> 00:15:32.795]  You can't do that.
[00:15:34.456 --> 00:15:35.777]  You can't do that to us.
[00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:38.959]  Think about it.
[00:15:40.586 --> 00:15:50.300]  And so they come out and say, okay, well then, we need all these billions more funding, and then six plus billion funding for BioShield and the forced inoculation.
[00:15:51.988 --> 00:15:55.329]  $2.4 billion a year to fund checkpoints under Seatbelt Initiative.
[00:15:55.349 --> 00:15:56.309]  You read the actual plan.
[00:15:56.349 --> 00:16:02.830]  It says it's about training you for internal checkpoints and for searches of your cars and national compulsory service.
[00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:08.091]  You'll have to go serve at the checkpoints for no pay and help search vehicles one day a week.
[00:16:08.611 --> 00:16:10.372]  I mean, this ain't America, folks.
[00:16:10.872 --> 00:16:18.113]  This is a melding of the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, China, everything we've ever seen bad.
[00:16:18.954 --> 00:16:26.558]  And then we've got these people parading around talking about how conservative they are and you're liberal if you say we're losing rights.
[00:16:28.719 --> 00:16:29.439]  We're liberal?
[00:16:30.059 --> 00:16:39.824]  You hear Ann Coulter and the Savages and the Limbaughs and the... You hear these people on the air and they say there's no CFR.
[00:16:39.884 --> 00:16:41.965]  They say there's no New World Order.
[00:16:42.045 --> 00:16:45.467]  They say the Patriot Act doesn't take any of your rights.
[00:16:47.388 --> 00:16:48.048]  I mean, people...
[00:16:49.253 --> 00:16:50.274]  Don't listen to me.
[00:16:50.314 --> 00:16:51.015]  Don't listen to them.
[00:16:51.035 --> 00:17:04.305]  Go read Board Agency Announcement 03-15, BAA 03-15, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA.
[00:17:06.186 --> 00:17:13.512]  You know, I scanned over this thing yesterday and looked over it this morning briefly, and, I mean, it's just full of nightmares.
[00:17:13.552 --> 00:17:14.413]  And it's exactly...
[00:17:15.306 --> 00:17:22.350]  They say it's for occupying a country, tracking and tracing digitally every citizen in a cashless society control grid.
[00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:23.350]  They use those terms.
[00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:27.532]  And they put the exact thing in here.
[00:17:28.473 --> 00:17:31.514]  And they've said, DARPA has said it's for you.
[00:17:31.574 --> 00:17:34.595]  It's not like I'm saying this is for you and they set it up.
[00:17:34.896 --> 00:17:35.956]  They've said it's for you.
[00:17:35.976 --> 00:17:39.678]  They've said everything you do is going to be watched in an attempted chilling effect.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:40.761]  We're good to go.
[00:18:00.015 --> 00:18:16.043]  It's admitted that that exists, and they now admit it's there, and now it's going to be used for what it was designed to be used for, to steal patent secrets, to spy on people, to control drug flow, to cut out any competition to the CIA with anybody dealing cocaine or heroin that isn't paying them off.
[00:18:17.873 --> 00:18:25.880]  But no, they don't have the personnel to track and trace your phone calls, your emails, your letters, your faxes, even with keyword software and listening systems.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:30.604]  But they're announcing it to scare you to cause the chilling effect.
[00:18:30.624 --> 00:18:32.566]  And now people are saying, I'm not going to speak out.
[00:18:32.606 --> 00:18:33.586]  Man, they're watching us.
[00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:36.249]  Isn't that the evidence of tyranny?
[00:18:36.869 --> 00:18:37.950]  Where's your Fourth Amendment?
[00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.753]  You go, well, things changed on 9-1-1.
[00:18:40.993 --> 00:18:41.573]  Things changed.
[00:18:41.593 --> 00:18:43.355]  Yeah, the border's more open than ever.
[00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:53.568]  And we're all being enslaved, and the globalists, the evidence documents, carried out the attacks, and are going to carry more attacks out to legitimize everything they're doing.
[00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.951]  So, this is what we're facing.
[00:18:58.991 --> 00:18:59.912]  This is the facts.
[00:18:59.992 --> 00:19:01.053]  This is the reality.
[00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:03.314]  Right now, we're looking at.
[00:19:07.717 --> 00:19:09.839]  I'm going to come back, and I'm going to read more of U.S.
[00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:12.781]  Develop's urban surveillance system, and then they go on to admit...
[00:19:14.295 --> 00:19:25.383]  That it's for face scanners, cameras, scanners of cars, cashless societies, ID cards, RFID chips, which they're going to make the Iraqis all aware now.
[00:19:27.044 --> 00:19:28.225]  And it's all happening right here.
[00:19:29.766 --> 00:19:33.689]  But see, when they get in trouble now to get funding, oh, it's for overseas.
[00:19:34.009 --> 00:19:36.451]  When Congress knows this is already set up here domestically.
[00:19:36.731 --> 00:19:37.532]  It's a big deal.
[00:19:37.692 --> 00:19:38.593]  What do you think about it?
[00:19:38.993 --> 00:19:40.014]  This latest spin.
[00:19:40.774 --> 00:19:43.156]  And on Monday it was Project Cowan.
[00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:46.886]  It's the tips program.
[00:19:47.427 --> 00:19:49.068]  Same system, same program.
[00:19:49.808 --> 00:19:51.210]  But see, now we've been conditioned.
[00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.071]  Ah, we won't get upset about talent.
[00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:55.713]  We got upset about tips, and well, they canceled that.
[00:19:55.793 --> 00:19:57.014]  Oh, they just changed the name.
[00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:59.816]  So now, are we going to get upset about it?
[00:20:00.156 --> 00:20:01.538]  Are we going to get involved?
[00:20:01.698 --> 00:20:02.238]  We should.
[00:20:03.179 --> 00:20:07.722]  Of course, there's Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh to pacify us and lie to us.
[00:20:07.762 --> 00:20:08.443]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:12.532 --> 00:20:13.032]  It's here.
[00:20:13.332 --> 00:20:14.053]  It's powerful.
[00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:22.916]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.216 --> 00:20:25.057]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[00:20:25.317 --> 00:20:27.417]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[00:20:27.657 --> 00:20:31.899]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[00:20:32.179 --> 00:20:37.903]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:39.864]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[00:20:40.024 --> 00:20:43.286]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[00:20:43.446 --> 00:20:45.007]  Get the powerful Berkey now.

[00:20:57.314 --> 00:20:59.615]  Not yet available in California and Iowa.

[00:21:17.005 --> 00:21:19.248]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:21:46.394 --> 00:21:46.874]  We're good to go.
[00:21:46.975 --> 00:21:47.235]  I think?
[00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:12.833]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:22:13.274 --> 00:22:17.817]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:22:18.198 --> 00:22:23.081]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:25.223]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:22:25.283 --> 00:22:26.284]  can barely be read.
[00:22:26.304 --> 00:22:27.545]  It has faded that much.
[00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:31.806]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[00:22:32.066 --> 00:22:40.427]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.

[00:23:12.502 --> 00:23:12.662]  I think?
[00:23:34.845 --> 00:23:35.546]  We're good to go.

[00:23:58.946 --> 00:23:59.346]  Barclay Financial.
[00:23:59.366 --> 00:23:59.827]  Mystery solved.
[00:23:59.907 --> 00:24:01.308]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:01.348 --> 00:24:02.409]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:24.267 --> 00:24:26.650]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.654]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:24:30.674 --> 00:24:30.774]  800-259-9231.
[00:24:30.894 --> 00:24:36.339]  So let me put it in a nutshell briefly, instead of that long rambling rant I just did.
[00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:37.640]  DARPA has set up
[00:24:48.886 --> 00:25:04.638]  In their own words, a military occupational government system in the United States has funded it, has put it in place right here in Austin where I live, five years ago.
[00:25:05.757 --> 00:25:23.068]  Base scanning cameras on every major street corner, now in the middle of neighborhoods, on 100-foot poles rotating around, watching everyone, microphones hanging out of trees, on telephone poles, in parking lots, a huge FEMA command center.
[00:25:24.008 --> 00:25:24.849]  This is everywhere.
[00:25:25.529 --> 00:25:28.891]  They've got a FEMA holding center with bolts and chains in the floors.
[00:25:29.932 --> 00:25:31.253]  They've got troops out there.
[00:25:31.393 --> 00:25:33.074]  I mean, this is just where I live.
[00:25:33.934 --> 00:25:35.475]  And it's in your town.
[00:25:35.515 --> 00:25:36.096]  Don't worry.
[00:25:38.497 --> 00:25:40.378]  And now they announce it to the world.
[00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:43.100]  Oh, yeah, we're going to use this in countries we occupy.
[00:25:44.701 --> 00:25:46.603]  So we know everything everybody does.
[00:25:48.824 --> 00:25:50.485]  That's how serious things have gotten.
[00:25:50.505 --> 00:25:51.646]  And I know this is scary.
[00:25:52.186 --> 00:25:52.547]  The U.S.
[00:25:52.567 --> 00:25:54.328]  develops urban surveillance system.
[00:25:56.155 --> 00:25:57.076]  And it goes on to say,
[00:26:11.451 --> 00:26:13.913]  The project's centerpiece is groundbreaking computer software.
[00:26:13.933 --> 00:26:20.857]  It's capable of automatically identifying vehicles by size, color, shape, and license tag, or drivers and passengers by faces.
[00:26:21.477 --> 00:26:22.718]  Oh, it's groundbreaking, yeah.
[00:26:23.118 --> 00:26:29.122]  DARPA, again, five years ago, had the microphones, the face scanners, going in all over the country.
[00:26:31.203 --> 00:26:40.409]  The project is being overseen by the Defense Agency Research Project Agency, which is helping the Pentagon develop new technologies for combating terrorism and fighting wars in the 21st century.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:42.761]  We're good to go.
[00:26:58.752 --> 00:27:06.934]  See, and I've got Ridge on tape, on C-SPAN, the head of Homeland Security, saying we're going to have four levels of security clearance to have everyday jobs.
[00:27:06.954 --> 00:27:11.995]  You're going to have to have a card to have a job and won't be able to go certain places.
[00:27:12.055 --> 00:27:17.256]  And if you've got bad credit or ever even had a misdemeanor conviction, you'll have nighttime curfews.
[00:27:17.756 --> 00:27:20.217]  But that's okay for the good citizens.
[00:27:20.297 --> 00:27:24.678]  They'll have their card until they don't pay their taxes properly or something.
[00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:28.011]  Folks, I'm not... This is so horrible.
[00:27:28.251 --> 00:27:29.911]  This is right out of The Running Man.
[00:27:30.871 --> 00:27:34.452]  I mean, it makes me want to start just giggling insanely.
[00:27:34.532 --> 00:27:37.373]  I mean, it just... This is so over the top.
[00:27:37.413 --> 00:27:38.833]  This is so evil.
[00:27:39.693 --> 00:27:45.054]  They're putting in dozens of the airports, the stuff where you walk through and you're naked.
[00:27:45.594 --> 00:27:47.675]  Gives them, you know, right down to every detail.
[00:27:48.135 --> 00:27:51.316]  Five airports have put NASA brain scanners in.
[00:27:51.776 --> 00:27:52.776]  Source on that, AP.
[00:27:54.304 --> 00:27:57.166]  They now pull you out of the line and go, the brain scanner shows you're agitated.
[00:27:57.186 --> 00:27:57.947]  Are you a terrorist?
[00:27:58.027 --> 00:27:59.508]  I mean, that's actually in the news.
[00:27:59.628 --> 00:28:00.749]  Brain scanners?
[00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:07.194]  We've already proven that the lie detector test has been a fraud all along, just the old-fashioned thing.
[00:28:07.234 --> 00:28:08.855]  Now they've got a brain scanner?
[00:28:09.696 --> 00:28:11.257]  So let's say you've got indigestion.
[00:28:11.277 --> 00:28:12.117]  You're in a bad mood.
[00:28:12.157 --> 00:28:12.698]  You're angry.
[00:28:13.311 --> 00:28:14.913]  You're 401k and doing too well.
[00:28:14.933 --> 00:28:20.579]  You're really angry sitting there at the airport and men walk over in their black uniforms and their black berets.
[00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:21.660]  Have you seen the new outfits?
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.482]  We need to talk to you, sir.
[00:28:23.542 --> 00:28:26.765]  The scanners picked up some brain activity.
[00:28:26.825 --> 00:28:30.489]  I mean, folks, this is worse than Brave New World.
[00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:32.191]  This is bonkers.
[00:28:34.187 --> 00:28:37.111]  But according to the neocons, there's no Patriot Act 2.
[00:28:37.552 --> 00:28:39.174]  Patriot Act 1 didn't take your rights.
[00:28:39.214 --> 00:28:40.376]  The lying liberals.
[00:28:40.656 --> 00:28:49.829]  No, the lying liberals, Chuckie Schumers, Hillary Clintons, Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxers, they all voted and helped author the Senate version!
[00:28:50.879 --> 00:28:54.241]  How dare you claim you're fighting them when you're with them?
[00:28:54.822 --> 00:29:09.371]  You make me sick, you gun-grabbing, missile-trading, supercomputer-handing-over, neocon, liar, trash, open-border, remoting... You're destroying this country!
[00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:16.715]  I am so sick of you, you lying... Man, I am sick of these neocons!
[00:29:16.775 --> 00:29:19.157]  I am getting madder and madder at these people!
[00:29:20.057 --> 00:29:25.541]  They are conning and manipulating the backbone, the bedrock, conservative Christian America.
[00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:27.462]  You have been so conned.
[00:29:27.803 --> 00:29:31.525]  I am so sick of Sean Hannity and all these liars.
[00:29:34.087 --> 00:29:46.096]  Man, I tell you what, I am really... If you're not upset about what's happening, these traitors tell you none of this is happening as it's being set up.
[00:29:46.816 --> 00:29:47.557]  These traitors.
[00:29:49.432 --> 00:29:50.933]  Are the ultimate liberals.
[00:29:51.174 --> 00:29:51.994]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.935 --> 00:29:54.516]  Your calls and a bunch of other news.
[00:29:54.556 --> 00:29:57.038]  I got some good news, too.
[00:29:57.058 --> 00:29:58.099]  800-259-9231.
[00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:01.662]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.162 --> 00:30:03.764]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.684 --> 00:30:07.527]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.469 --> 00:30:13.752]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation.
[00:30:13.992 --> 00:30:16.634]  But during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:30:17.333 --> 00:30:21.174]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... 481-9858.
[00:30:21.195 --> 00:30:21.235]  800-481-9858.
[00:30:21.255 --> 00:30:21.475]  That's 800-481-9858.
[00:30:21.495 --> 00:30:24.776]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:30:24.796 --> 00:30:26.316]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:46.886 --> 00:30:48.807]  I'm going to your calls in about three minutes.
[00:30:49.187 --> 00:30:52.469]  Chuck, Bill, Dan, Jeff, many others.
[00:30:52.749 --> 00:30:57.491]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 800-259-9231.
[00:30:58.171 --> 00:31:01.293]  I'm Alex Jones, and I got a little bit emotional in the last segment.
[00:31:02.593 --> 00:31:13.378]  I don't know how we can watch DARPA setting up a militarized slave grid right out of the running man and admit it in their own policy report
[00:31:14.787 --> 00:31:16.728]  And brag about how they're doing it to us.
[00:31:19.129 --> 00:31:22.451]  And that they're training the troops to torture us and to confiscate our guns.
[00:31:22.531 --> 00:31:23.632]  I got them all on video.
[00:31:23.652 --> 00:31:24.272]  I got FEMA.
[00:31:24.332 --> 00:31:24.993]  I got troops.
[00:31:25.433 --> 00:31:26.213]  I got police.
[00:31:26.774 --> 00:31:29.075]  I got them at checkpoints carrying it out against women.
[00:31:30.276 --> 00:31:30.696]  I got them.
[00:31:31.196 --> 00:31:31.776]  I got them all.
[00:31:31.876 --> 00:31:32.257]  I got them.
[00:31:32.397 --> 00:31:33.377]  I got them caught, folks.
[00:31:33.477 --> 00:31:34.338]  I know what they're doing.
[00:31:34.398 --> 00:31:35.599]  It's very scary.
[00:31:36.499 --> 00:31:38.040]  It makes me so mad.
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.461]  It makes me very angry.
[00:31:40.621 --> 00:31:43.243]  And, I mean, I am.
[00:31:43.323 --> 00:31:43.603]  I just...
[00:31:44.409 --> 00:31:45.370]  I don't know what to say anymore.
[00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.891]  It's so horrible what they're doing.
[00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:49.932]  But I do know this.
[00:31:51.473 --> 00:31:52.434]  We can stop them.
[00:31:52.694 --> 00:31:53.714]  We can back them off.
[00:31:54.315 --> 00:31:56.016]  And there is some good news.
[00:31:56.036 --> 00:31:56.896]  Look at this headline.
[00:31:57.436 --> 00:31:58.297]  Washington Times.
[00:31:58.357 --> 00:32:00.158]  Pro-life women shift to majority.
[00:32:01.439 --> 00:32:04.600]  And the pro-life movement is winning the fight for the hearts and minds of the people.
[00:32:06.261 --> 00:32:09.543]  In many states, 70-plus percent of the population is against abortion.
[00:32:09.563 --> 00:32:11.784]  But in general, it's about 60%.
[00:32:13.827 --> 00:32:15.148]  But that's counting men and women.
[00:32:15.589 --> 00:32:17.450]  Generally, most women were for abortion.
[00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.132]  Now that's shifted to most women being against abortion.
[00:32:20.152 --> 00:32:21.273]  I'll get to those numbers later.
[00:32:22.934 --> 00:32:24.015]  Also, we'll go to Europe.
[00:32:24.535 --> 00:32:26.457]  We're in one particular country, Switzerland.
[00:32:27.057 --> 00:32:31.301]  Half of Swiss deaths dubbed suicide, assisted suicides.
[00:32:32.582 --> 00:32:35.484]  So that's coming up.
[00:32:35.764 --> 00:32:40.107]  In an article I never got to yesterday that I should have, global war looms, top U.S.
[00:32:40.148 --> 00:32:43.150]  officials discuss expanding terror war to Iran and beyond.
[00:32:43.968 --> 00:32:44.669]  That's coming up.
[00:32:44.709 --> 00:32:55.042]  Before I go to these loaded phone calls, all the people that are patiently holding there, I really do want to invite everybody to get my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:32:55.082 --> 00:33:01.671]  It's an excellent book, and it covers what really happened on September 11th and who stands to gain.
[00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:07.111]  The book is 230 pages long.
[00:33:07.191 --> 00:33:07.331]  It's $12.
[00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:12.773]  I've made my films that I really recommend because you can make copies of them.
[00:33:12.793 --> 00:33:16.995]  They're like mini printing presses like they had in 1776 and beyond.
[00:33:17.836 --> 00:33:28.981]  Before that and after that, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, covers government-sponsored terrorism, the history of it, September 11th, the takeover, Patriot Act, Homeland Security, all the rest of the garbage.
[00:33:29.659 --> 00:33:30.400]  We're good to go.
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.340]  We're good to go.
[00:33:56.405 --> 00:33:59.228]  That's just one film, and that's about half of what's in it, okay?
[00:33:59.268 --> 00:34:08.277]  It's an hour, and it's two hours and 24 minutes long on VHS, 170 minutes, even longer on DVD.
[00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:11.060]  So you need to order that.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.264]  And I got Masters of Terror, Part II, A Road to Tyranny.
[00:34:15.364 --> 00:34:16.025]  It's excellent.
[00:34:16.065 --> 00:34:20.690]  Police State III, Total Enslavement is the most comprehensive film I've ever made.
[00:34:21.845 --> 00:34:23.666]  But I suggest you watch it in three parts.
[00:34:24.086 --> 00:34:28.427]  It's two hours and 40 minutes long and so jam-packed.
[00:34:28.507 --> 00:34:29.968]  It's accelerated information.
[00:34:30.888 --> 00:34:32.488]  It's more highbrow.
[00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:37.110]  It's kind of university level, they would say, graduate level.
[00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:40.211]  You need to get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:42.371]  You need to have all these videos.
[00:34:42.411 --> 00:34:44.052]  They're $25.95 a piece.
[00:34:44.532 --> 00:34:47.393]  If you order three or more, they drop down to $20 a piece.
[00:34:47.413 --> 00:34:48.353]  That's a big discount.
[00:34:49.224 --> 00:34:51.285]  And your purchase supports this broadcast.
[00:34:51.365 --> 00:34:54.707]  I've got pro-gun, anti-New World Order t-shirts.
[00:34:55.007 --> 00:34:57.649]  I've got anti-treason t-shirts.
[00:34:58.269 --> 00:34:59.330]  I've got bumper stickers.
[00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.192]  All that stuff at InfoWars.com, at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:03.652 --> 00:35:06.473]  Or call toll-free to order and support the broadcast.
[00:35:06.493 --> 00:35:07.234]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:07.254 --> 00:35:07.634]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:19.258 --> 00:35:26.380]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:31.021]  All right, I said three minutes.
[00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:31.861]  It's been five minutes.
[00:35:31.901 --> 00:35:33.641]  Let's go to the calls.
[00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:38.523]  I really do want you all to take action and get the videos.
[00:35:38.543 --> 00:35:38.743]  888-253-3139.
[00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:41.183]  Chuck in Texas, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:35:41.223 --> 00:35:41.763]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:35:42.304 --> 00:35:44.084]  Alex, how are you all doing this morning?
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:49.182]  I am just... They're out in the open saying they're setting up a military dictatorship.
[00:35:50.343 --> 00:35:55.586]  When I heard you talking about that, I had to call in yesterday on Channel 12 News.
[00:35:55.666 --> 00:36:08.934]  I was watching the television, and Angela Vierville had Dr. Eugene Levitoff from Space Key Corporation, who operates out of San Antonio, Texas, and they were saying about how they've got these...
[00:36:09.645 --> 00:36:12.211]  Wonderful facial recognition cameras.
[00:36:12.251 --> 00:36:13.534]  You know, they're all the rage.
[00:36:13.854 --> 00:36:16.400]  And now to get into work, you'll have to do it.
[00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:19.426]  To start your car, official, you'll have to do it.
[00:36:20.206 --> 00:36:21.866]  If you want insurance, you've got to get it.
[00:36:21.926 --> 00:36:22.727]  It stops theft.
[00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:23.427]  You're against theft.
[00:36:23.767 --> 00:36:26.348]  And now DARPA admits the microphone.
[00:36:26.408 --> 00:36:27.608]  San Antonio is one of the worst.
[00:36:27.648 --> 00:36:29.008]  You're totally gritted there.
[00:36:29.568 --> 00:36:32.449]  They've got the barcode readers on the telephone poles.
[00:36:32.809 --> 00:36:34.310]  They've got the face scanners.
[00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:36.030]  They've got the license plate scanners.
[00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:36.450]  Go ahead.
[00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.671]  Yeah, I've seen the cameras on the...
[00:36:40.558 --> 00:36:44.859]  Well, I was talking to... Before I called in, I called the Space Key Corporation...
[00:37:09.958 --> 00:37:20.409]  And she says, well, we mainly just sell to folks that have private businesses, you know, to where you would only let in employees, and so no one can punch out for you.
[00:37:20.429 --> 00:37:21.550]  Yeah, I'm aware of the corporation.
[00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:22.531]  It's a government front.
[00:37:22.571 --> 00:37:24.253]  That's why I said for employees, you know.
[00:37:24.593 --> 00:37:29.578]  Sure, and I'm sure they'd turn down a million-dollar government contract, you know.
[00:37:30.516 --> 00:37:40.340]  Well, sir, I mean, it's publicly announced a couple years ago, the San Antonio Police Department and your Department of Transportation in the state of Texas bought the FaceIt technology.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.181]  Texas rents it for about $5 million a year.
[00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:46.542]  San Antonio's paying $400,000 a year for it.
[00:37:46.722 --> 00:37:48.223]  They're hooking it into all the cameras.
[00:37:50.324 --> 00:37:53.125]  I know when they first came out... How do I remember all this stuff?
[00:37:54.097 --> 00:37:57.318]  It is horrible, isn't it, having to remember all these things?
[00:37:57.919 --> 00:38:00.960]  Yeah, it is horrible when you've got almost a photographic memory.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.541]  And no one else out there really knows what you're talking about.
[00:38:04.641 --> 00:38:05.942]  They think you're out of your mind.
[00:38:06.442 --> 00:38:16.946]  You show them the articles, and they say, when you show them the articles out of the paper, they just look and shake their heads and go, well, I'm sure it's for good reason, you know.
[00:38:17.526 --> 00:38:18.566]  Don't you want to be safer?
[00:38:18.626 --> 00:38:20.467]  Yeah, I sure wish they'd stick them on the border.
[00:38:20.487 --> 00:38:22.928]  I sure wish they'd do something about that.
[00:38:23.957 --> 00:38:33.183]  Look, type in Patriot Act compliance in a search engine, and you'll find out what it's being used for, and you'll find out what liars the neocons are.
[00:38:33.203 --> 00:38:43.350]  All your banking, your transactions, everything you do, your credit card records, all these corporations are already, quote, complying and uploading this to the government.
[00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:50.395]  Your Safeway cards, your grocery store discount cards, before 9-1-1, it's all going to the government.
[00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:53.617]  RFID tracker chips going in most of the products.
[00:38:54.289 --> 00:39:02.694]  Just total bedlam, total just... I've got DARPA here saying this is to enslave and track an entire population.
[00:39:03.194 --> 00:39:03.534]  Okay?
[00:39:05.175 --> 00:39:07.517]  They're quote going to put this in occupied Iraq.
[00:39:07.577 --> 00:39:12.900]  Yeah, occupied countries have troops on the streets and face scanning cameras and it's been set up here.
[00:39:13.413 --> 00:39:19.695]  You remember when Colin Powell was in Russia, and I forget who he was talking to, someone in their State Department, I guess.
[00:39:20.315 --> 00:39:22.276]  No, he was talking to the head of the FSB.
[00:39:22.696 --> 00:39:23.256]  Oh, yeah.
[00:39:23.436 --> 00:39:24.957]  Federal Security Bureau.
[00:39:25.077 --> 00:39:30.258]  Yeah, he said, if y'all just had Social Security cards up there, you'd be able to track your citizens better.
[00:39:30.358 --> 00:39:32.019]  Yeah, you'd have an internal passport.
[00:39:32.859 --> 00:39:33.379]  Exactly.
[00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:36.820]  And the Russians said, we've tried to reinstate that.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.880]  Our people refuse.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.401]  They say it's the mark of the beast.
[00:39:41.072 --> 00:39:43.153]  Well, they might be a little smarter in Russia.
[00:39:43.193 --> 00:39:43.653]  Who knows?
[00:39:44.074 --> 00:39:45.855]  Well, they've seen it, I guess.
[00:39:45.895 --> 00:39:50.137]  You know, we've been a bunch of idiots here who had it good and flushed it all down the toilet now.
[00:39:50.157 --> 00:39:55.720]  And all the bug-eyed, mindless yuppies with their big, plastic American flags are going to find out.
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.181]  This is true.
[00:39:59.502 --> 00:40:05.645]  It just scares me every time I talk to somebody that thinks they're a conservative and they're for all these things.
[00:40:06.406 --> 00:40:07.566]  Oh, yeah, Bush is good.
[00:40:08.006 --> 00:40:10.548]  Look, I've been on shows, dozens of them now.
[00:40:12.006 --> 00:40:15.227]  And people will call in and say, you're a liar, Bush is a conservative.
[00:40:15.288 --> 00:40:24.872]  And I'll say, he's signing the assault weapons ban, an added ban on all semi-automatic shotguns, a shutdown of gun shows, National Ballistics Database, which is gun registration.
[00:40:25.552 --> 00:40:26.633]  And they'll say, you're a liar.
[00:40:26.673 --> 00:40:29.094]  And the host will go, well, actually, we covered that last week.
[00:40:29.114 --> 00:40:30.855]  And the guy goes, well, so what then?
[00:40:31.275 --> 00:40:32.015]  I'm for it.
[00:40:32.555 --> 00:40:33.996]  I'm for gun control.
[00:40:34.936 --> 00:40:37.698]  I'm a liberal because I'm against gun control.
[00:40:37.778 --> 00:40:40.659]  I mean, this is how insane it's gotten.
[00:40:41.494 --> 00:40:43.034]  If their fathers could only hear them.
[00:40:43.714 --> 00:40:44.815]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:48.715]  I've got liberals so mind-controlled, they don't even know they're liberals.
[00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:54.236]  And the word liberal doesn't even apply, but that's the term they call themselves if they could just look in the mirror.
[00:40:55.217 --> 00:41:05.679]  Well, a lot of this stuff, I remember back in the 70s, it was America, love it or leave it, and they were using the same type of head games that they're using today.
[00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:07.639]  Oh, yeah, that song, love it or leave it.
[00:41:08.547 --> 00:41:08.767]  No.
[00:41:08.887 --> 00:41:12.509]  Oh, I guess the Founding Fathers then love what the British are doing to you or leave it.
[00:41:12.529 --> 00:41:14.070]  I mean, what does that mean?
[00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:15.230]  This is America.
[00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:16.451]  I love America.
[00:41:16.531 --> 00:41:18.111]  I don't love what they're doing to it.
[00:41:18.472 --> 00:41:20.853]  They should leave and go to Russia or China.
[00:41:21.933 --> 00:41:22.853]  Thanks for the call, Chuck.
[00:41:22.893 --> 00:41:23.394]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:41:24.714 --> 00:41:37.240]  For those that just joined us, look, DARPA is describing a control grid to dominate and control citizens, cashless society, ID cards, face scanning cameras, license plate scanners, everywhere.
[00:41:37.927 --> 00:41:40.048]  And it's the exact system they funded and put in here.
[00:41:40.328 --> 00:41:43.949]  They want it for Iraq and Syria and all these countries that are about to be enslaved.
[00:41:44.989 --> 00:41:46.669]  And they say it's for here in America, too.
[00:41:47.429 --> 00:41:47.689]  See?
[00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.070]  DARPA put the cameras in.
[00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:53.311]  DARPA put the microphones in right here in Austin.
[00:41:54.711 --> 00:41:55.591]  Five years ago.
[00:41:56.252 --> 00:41:57.812]  That's nothing to do with 911.
[00:41:58.152 --> 00:41:59.733]  That was their excuse for the rollout.
[00:42:00.233 --> 00:42:01.413]  Bill in North Carolina.
[00:42:01.453 --> 00:42:02.333]  Bill, you're on the air.
[00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.714]  Hey, Alex.
[00:42:03.834 --> 00:42:05.034]  I haven't talked to you in a while, man.
[00:42:05.054 --> 00:42:05.494]  You doing okay?
[00:42:07.153 --> 00:42:09.115]  Well, no, the country isn't doing very well.
[00:42:09.456 --> 00:42:13.399]  Well, as long as we're doing okay, maybe we can do something about the country, right?
[00:42:13.699 --> 00:42:14.200]  Exactly.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.363]  Hey, I wanted to give you more bad news about Walmart.
[00:42:19.144 --> 00:42:24.189]  Have you heard the story that came out today on Walmart about the gay right?
[00:42:24.529 --> 00:42:25.129]  Yes, I did.
[00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:33.637]  Yeah, I just thought it was very interesting in that they were saying here their vice president for communications, Mona Williams...
[00:42:34.586 --> 00:42:41.013]  I told the Times that the most important factor was a letter to senior management from several gay employees.
[00:42:41.073 --> 00:42:44.677]  Apparently there was a gay rights... What was the name of this?
[00:42:44.777 --> 00:42:45.758]  Let's see here.
[00:42:46.719 --> 00:42:52.485]  The Pride Foundation, a Seattle gay rights organization, they invested in Walmart to get this policy changed.
[00:42:53.806 --> 00:42:56.309]  And they were saying here that basically that...
[00:42:57.489 --> 00:42:57.629]  Ms.
[00:42:57.689 --> 00:43:02.453]  Mona Williams was saying, we want all of our associates to feel they are valued and treated with respect.
[00:43:02.774 --> 00:43:04.075]  Well, let me just stop you.
[00:43:04.355 --> 00:43:05.176]  Let me just stop you.
[00:43:05.436 --> 00:43:05.636]  Yeah.
[00:43:06.577 --> 00:43:10.680]  Why should anybody be talking about sex, period, at their job?
[00:43:11.281 --> 00:43:13.022]  Well, I'm going to tell you something.
[00:43:13.042 --> 00:43:15.104]  I used to work for Walmart, okay?
[00:43:15.645 --> 00:43:17.186]  And I was fired from Walmart.
[00:43:17.586 --> 00:43:20.129]  Are you ready for the reason that I was fired from Walmart?
[00:43:20.269 --> 00:43:21.009]  Why was that, Bill?
[00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:24.993]  Because a customer said that she didn't like the way I looked at her.
[00:43:26.545 --> 00:43:26.806]  I think so.
[00:43:40.859 --> 00:43:45.083]  Either you'll be in one of their camps, or you'll be working for them, because there won't be any other retail stores.
[00:43:45.403 --> 00:43:46.344]  Yeah.
[00:43:46.364 --> 00:43:48.506]  They're only 33% of total retail sales.
[00:43:48.767 --> 00:43:55.753]  Yeah, I just think it's quite interesting, though, that they're going to give all these extra rights to the gays, but what about the heterosexuals?
[00:43:55.773 --> 00:43:57.315]  What about heterosexual rights?
[00:43:58.177 --> 00:43:59.777]  Well, there's no such thing, and you know that.
[00:44:00.298 --> 00:44:05.419]  The stated plan of UNESCO that Bush has signed on to is to destroy the family unit.
[00:44:05.439 --> 00:44:08.520]  It is called a disease to end the family.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:14.242]  Public statement, the manual put out by UNESCO for its diplomats.
[00:44:15.442 --> 00:44:20.565]  Just to put in a plug for the competition on this, let's all shop at Target or somewhere else.
[00:44:20.585 --> 00:44:21.245]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:44:21.445 --> 00:44:23.066]  Oh, Target gives money to anti-gun.
[00:44:23.086 --> 00:44:23.927]  They're New World Order, too.
[00:44:24.507 --> 00:44:25.848]  Yeah, well, what are we going to do?
[00:44:25.868 --> 00:44:27.389]  They're putting the RFIDs in.
[00:44:27.429 --> 00:44:31.091]  Well, just start shopping at the Mom and Pop, even if you pay two bucks more for a $20 item.
[00:44:31.111 --> 00:44:32.031]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:32.071 --> 00:44:32.472]  That's true.
[00:44:32.512 --> 00:44:33.372]  I do that frequently.
[00:44:33.412 --> 00:44:33.732]  Thank you.
[00:44:34.132 --> 00:44:34.613]  Absolutely.
[00:44:34.653 --> 00:44:39.055]  And what I do is that most... See, Walmart doesn't just buy its goods.
[00:44:39.095 --> 00:44:43.918]  It also owns at least 700 slave camps, according to Amnesty International and others.
[00:44:45.285 --> 00:44:55.150]  So even if you have to buy from Pakistan or Germany or Turkey or Bangladesh or Mexico, that is better than buying something made in China.
[00:44:56.610 --> 00:45:05.215]  You know, I spent a couple minutes looking in 20, 30 different combs in Russia for the made in America, and I did find one.
[00:45:05.275 --> 00:45:05.995]  What's the brand name?
[00:45:06.175 --> 00:45:06.435]  Ace?
[00:45:08.576 --> 00:45:12.038]  So if we all search, and it's there.
[00:45:13.596 --> 00:45:16.957]  If you can't buy American, buy something other than China.
[00:45:19.058 --> 00:45:21.459]  And some money does come back to us from Mexico.
[00:45:21.479 --> 00:45:22.880]  I mean, hardly anything.
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:31.943]  It's more like 20 to 1 from the statistics I've seen, or more than 20 to 1, but that's still better than what we have with China.
[00:45:32.523 --> 00:45:34.504]  I mean, our trade deficit with Mexico is $30 billion.
[00:45:34.544 --> 00:45:38.806]  It's like $150-something billion now a year with China.
[00:45:38.866 --> 00:45:39.786]  I think it's $180 billion.
[00:45:39.806 --> 00:45:40.286]  I forget.
[00:45:40.326 --> 00:45:41.487]  Those numbers get mixed together.
[00:45:42.378 --> 00:45:44.180]  But, I mean, this is out of control.
[00:45:45.081 --> 00:45:46.443]  Okay, thanks for the call, Bill.
[00:45:47.404 --> 00:45:49.186]  Let's talk to Dan in Illinois.
[00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:50.108]  Dan, you're on the air.
[00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:50.568]  Go ahead.
[00:45:50.588 --> 00:45:51.429]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:52.130]  Pretty good, sir.
[00:45:52.771 --> 00:45:53.211]  I don't know.
[00:45:53.352 --> 00:45:55.034]  I came in a little bit late.
[00:45:55.114 --> 00:45:57.977]  Did you read about what Bush said in Reuters?
[00:45:59.187 --> 00:46:01.248]  Yeah, he said, bring it on.
[00:46:01.308 --> 00:46:03.029]  He doesn't care if our troops are getting killed.
[00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:05.931]  He stuck his chest out, bugged his eyes out.
[00:46:05.951 --> 00:46:08.212]  I've got a photo of him saying it in the press conference.
[00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:09.953]  He said, bring it on.
[00:46:09.973 --> 00:46:14.296]  Yeah, bring the depleted uranium onto our troops as they are now.
[00:46:14.356 --> 00:46:17.217]  The Army's own former head scientist is saying it's killing them.
[00:46:17.578 --> 00:46:18.278]  Bring it on.
[00:46:18.338 --> 00:46:19.419]  Who cares about the troops?
[00:46:20.159 --> 00:46:22.040]  That's the most absurd statement.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.122]  He's acting like his life is at stake the way he says it.
[00:46:27.289 --> 00:46:38.076]  They got a new movie coming out produced by Lionel Chet when the head of the media take over for Bush, the guy that threatened me in Hollywood on the set, and in front of witnesses, he admitted in front of witnesses that he just threatened me.
[00:46:38.396 --> 00:46:44.720]  He made a made-for-TV movie where Bush has to be physically restrained by people in Air Force One as he goes, Take me there!
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.261]  I want to fist fight bin Laden!
[00:46:46.301 --> 00:46:47.943]  I mean, how stupid!
[00:46:48.323 --> 00:46:48.503]  Right.
[00:46:49.062 --> 00:46:51.664]  Where he, like, goes into a rage of love of America.
[00:46:51.724 --> 00:46:55.165]  Give me a break!
[00:46:55.226 --> 00:46:55.906]  I love it.
[00:46:55.966 --> 00:46:58.607]  He puts other people at risk with his big mouth.
[00:46:58.667 --> 00:47:06.892]  I mean, the guy had long hair, wore flip-flops, wore patchouli, wafting marijuana smoke and scotch liquor breath and other things.
[00:47:06.952 --> 00:47:07.713]  This is admitted.
[00:47:08.433 --> 00:47:13.276]  Showed up for a few months and disappeared in the last year at the Air Force.
[00:47:13.896 --> 00:47:14.737]  I've seen photos.
[00:47:14.777 --> 00:47:17.098]  The guy was like a beatnik or something.
[00:47:17.558 --> 00:47:24.784]  Some little dirty Kenny Buckport main blue blood running around with his dirty flip-flops, and this is our big tough guy bringing on.
[00:47:24.804 --> 00:47:26.766]  One more thing, Al.
[00:47:29.268 --> 00:47:33.331]  I feel I think you'd agree that, you know, the whole plan is like to turn us into a third world country.
[00:47:34.292 --> 00:47:37.835]  I guess we won't, you know, third world countries doesn't need a lot of airlines, do they?
[00:47:38.519 --> 00:47:46.965]  No, a third world country's just got big armored compounds, luxury compounds, and hover drones flying around, and us all in the dirty cities going, yeah, thank you, governor.
[00:47:47.386 --> 00:47:50.968]  Oh, yes, more government jobs, handouts, help us.
[00:47:51.308 --> 00:47:52.169]  Oh, thank you.
[00:47:52.189 --> 00:47:56.432]  I mean, isn't this kind of like you can see the long run that these airlines can never survive?
[00:47:56.512 --> 00:47:58.714]  It's like a plot to totally destroy them.
[00:47:59.705 --> 00:48:07.208]  And then if and when terrorists hit the buses and the troops are on that, the trains, they've said it.
[00:48:07.288 --> 00:48:08.409]  Troops will be everywhere.
[00:48:08.429 --> 00:48:12.751]  You'll have to have an ID card to have a job, a nighttime curfew.
[00:48:13.331 --> 00:48:14.551]  Doesn't it sound like freedom to you?
[00:48:14.571 --> 00:48:16.672]  It's going to be an airline pretty soon.
[00:48:16.712 --> 00:48:17.292]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:48:17.713 --> 00:48:19.874]  But, Dan, don't worry.
[00:48:19.894 --> 00:48:21.114]  The border's going to stay wide open.
[00:48:21.134 --> 00:48:21.894]  Doesn't that sound good to you?
[00:48:22.134 --> 00:48:24.275]  We're going to accept all these fake IDs from illegals.
[00:48:24.295 --> 00:48:25.056]  Doesn't that sound good?
[00:48:25.116 --> 00:48:25.816]  That would be wonderful.
[00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:26.476]  But don't worry.
[00:48:26.516 --> 00:48:28.077]  DARPA's going to watch you and your family.
[00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:29.776]  No more Fourth Amendment.

[00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:37.154]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:49:37.515 --> 00:49:41.597]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:41.898 --> 00:49:42.438]  We listened.
[00:49:42.738 --> 00:49:47.722]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:48.002 --> 00:49:48.482]  We listened.
[00:49:48.883 --> 00:49:51.925]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:52.345 --> 00:49:52.886]  We listened.
[00:49:53.346 --> 00:49:56.228]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[00:49:56.288 --> 00:49:56.608]  We're good.

[00:50:30.965 --> 00:50:37.772]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:50:38.132 --> 00:50:39.494]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:50:39.694 --> 00:50:41.896]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:50:42.056 --> 00:50:44.138]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:50:44.419 --> 00:50:49.364]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:50:49.704 --> 00:50:53.728]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:50:53.968 --> 00:50:55.749]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:50:55.829 --> 00:51:06.474]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:06.614 --> 00:51:08.515]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:08.715 --> 00:51:12.557]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:51:12.677 --> 00:51:14.258]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:51:14.278 --> 00:51:14.778]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:51:21.001 --> 00:51:24.624]  Yeah, early in the next hour, I'll dig this Reuters article out with Bush's press conference.
[00:51:49.784 --> 00:51:51.645]  Where he said, bring it on.
[00:51:53.786 --> 00:51:56.227]  Just, you know, real funny that our troops are getting killed.
[00:51:56.247 --> 00:52:03.291]  And they're huffing DU and, well, Sarin and VX in the first Gulf War, and they never got treatment.
[00:52:03.711 --> 00:52:06.472]  Later came out, yes, they were hit, and the government knew it all along.
[00:52:07.253 --> 00:52:12.335]  And now it's come out they sprayed the troops in the 60s and 70s with deadly chemicals and biologicals and radiologicals.
[00:52:12.736 --> 00:52:13.556]  They could care less.
[00:52:13.576 --> 00:52:15.577]  Just thousands and thousands of them sprayed.
[00:52:15.957 --> 00:52:17.178]  Hundreds of tests on ships.
[00:52:18.021 --> 00:52:18.741]  But that's okay.
[00:52:18.761 --> 00:52:27.203]  You support the troops by not caring about them, by being a mindless huskhead who doesn't have any information, that thinks handing your guns in is conservative.
[00:52:28.203 --> 00:52:29.703]  Let's talk to Jeff in Missouri.
[00:52:29.763 --> 00:52:30.664]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:52:30.744 --> 00:52:31.224]  Go ahead.
[00:52:34.884 --> 00:52:36.065]  Yes, Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:52:36.105 --> 00:52:36.565]  Go ahead.
[00:52:36.585 --> 00:52:38.345]  Hello, are you there?
[00:52:38.585 --> 00:52:39.745]  Yeah, I'm here, right here.
[00:52:40.646 --> 00:52:47.687]  Anyway, yeah, the DARPA face recognition camera software wound up going into our main intersection up here in Sedalia about...
[00:52:48.743 --> 00:52:51.704]  A town of about 19,000 a couple of weeks ago.
[00:52:52.525 --> 00:52:57.887]  And this is only a town of 19,000 to 20,000, so I imagine if people look out, it's going in everywhere.
[00:52:59.227 --> 00:53:07.311]  Well, DARPA says it's for occupied countries, and they've put the grid in here, and they're advertising the grid they put in here for all other occupied countries.
[00:53:07.371 --> 00:53:12.533]  I mean, I have their official report on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:53:13.618 --> 00:53:16.241]  You got any suggestions on how to fight this at a local level?
[00:53:16.661 --> 00:53:32.537]  Yeah, you take this AP article, you take the DARPA report, you read the 40-page report in their own words, you take it to the city council, and you say, I don't care if you got $50,000 or whatever your town got, but for a town that size is probably how much they got, because that's how much they rent it to small towns.
[00:53:33.118 --> 00:53:37.442]  And you say, you take that out now, this is what it's for, and if you have to, you make...
[00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:39.831]  10,000 copies at Kinko's.
[00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:42.852]  You and 10 people get together and put the money in to do it.
[00:53:43.833 --> 00:53:45.834]  You print up a one sheet explaining what it is.
[00:53:45.874 --> 00:53:47.235]  You put the AP article with it.
[00:53:47.535 --> 00:53:48.755]  You print up 10,000 of them.
[00:53:48.775 --> 00:53:49.656]  You knock on doors.
[00:53:49.676 --> 00:53:50.416]  You hand them out.
[00:53:50.656 --> 00:53:51.537]  You have a rally.
[00:53:51.577 --> 00:53:53.438]  You remove the city council if need be.
[00:53:53.698 --> 00:53:56.559]  And you take those dirty cameras down.
[00:53:56.859 --> 00:53:58.320]  It takes local action.
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.342]  People can forget dealing with the president or the federal level.
[00:54:02.694 --> 00:54:03.034]  Alrighty.
[00:54:03.435 --> 00:54:08.878]  Just like the move to stand up against the Patriot Act, my resolution has now been passed by some cities and towns.
[00:54:09.778 --> 00:54:16.342]  Talks about the control grid, the DARPA system, the NORTHCOM, military martial law jurisdiction.
[00:54:16.382 --> 00:54:17.383]  This is their own statements.
[00:54:17.923 --> 00:54:21.005]  You take that and you get it passed and you take over your town.
[00:54:21.545 --> 00:54:23.046]  This is life or death, people.
[00:54:23.326 --> 00:54:25.167]  We're under military attack.
[00:54:25.407 --> 00:54:27.229]  They're setting up the control grid.
[00:54:27.749 --> 00:54:31.031]  They're saying it is... Folks, they're not even hiding this.
[00:54:32.685 --> 00:54:35.186]  How long has DARPA said it's to watch all citizens?
[00:54:35.427 --> 00:54:36.647]  How long have they said this?
[00:54:36.687 --> 00:54:37.788]  They're doing it right now.
[00:54:39.269 --> 00:54:40.049]  Anything else, Jeff?
[00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:41.150]  No, that's about it.
[00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:44.551]  I wish you Godspeed, Alex, and take care of yourself.
[00:54:44.912 --> 00:54:45.552]  Absolutely.
[00:54:45.572 --> 00:54:47.213]  You know, it's up to listeners of this show.
[00:54:47.233 --> 00:54:47.553]  Yep.
[00:54:47.573 --> 00:54:49.994]  If you want to take control of your cities, you can do it.
[00:54:50.295 --> 00:54:50.815]  Thanks, Jeff.
[00:54:52.156 --> 00:54:52.676]  Bye-bye.
[00:54:53.136 --> 00:54:54.857]  Let's talk to Spencer in Ohio.
[00:54:54.897 --> 00:54:55.858]  Spencer, you're on the air.
[00:54:55.938 --> 00:54:56.318]  Go ahead.
[00:54:56.914 --> 00:54:57.715]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[00:54:57.755 --> 00:55:01.457]  You know, I've heard a lot about Operation Northwoods, thanks to you and your website.
[00:55:02.058 --> 00:55:10.204]  But what my question is, was that one of three operations vetoed by JFK, along with Operations Zapata and Operations Trinidad?
[00:55:11.998 --> 00:55:13.679]  Yes, he did veto those.
[00:55:13.719 --> 00:55:16.900]  He also vetoed Zebra Rifle Team.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.960]  I need to get the experts on about that.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.001]  But, yeah, he did.
[00:55:20.341 --> 00:55:21.461]  When he found out the U.S.
[00:55:21.481 --> 00:55:22.381]  government, he was a hawk.
[00:55:22.401 --> 00:55:25.602]  Remember, increased defense spending was all for invading Vietnam.
[00:55:25.642 --> 00:55:33.705]  But when he found out that they wanted to kill American citizens and blame it on foreign enemies, Kennedy said, no, I will not kill citizens and blame it on enemies.
[00:55:33.725 --> 00:55:37.286]  So they said, okay, well, we'll just deal with you and Daily Plaza then, won't we?
[00:55:38.087 --> 00:55:44.711]  Yeah, and on September 4th, 1964, the New York Times reported George Bush is chairman of Zapata Oil.
[00:55:47.332 --> 00:55:49.854]  I mean, the Zapata plan is obviously still in effect.
[00:55:50.174 --> 00:55:54.096]  I mean, how does that tie into the Seven Sisters Oil Cartel?
[00:55:55.237 --> 00:55:55.417]  And H.L.
[00:55:55.617 --> 00:55:57.678]  Hunt and Jack Ruby started Lifeline.
[00:55:59.419 --> 00:56:04.382]  Well, Jack Ruby was a nice mafia man, and he sure dealt with the patsy.
[00:56:04.963 --> 00:56:07.024]  Oswald being let out, I'm a patsy, I'm a patsy!
[00:56:08.968 --> 00:56:09.869]  I work for the government.
[00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:10.530]  Boom!
[00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:12.631]  Got rid of that problem.
[00:56:12.691 --> 00:56:13.432]  Ha ha ha.
[00:56:13.452 --> 00:56:15.274]  It's all part of the freedom.
[00:56:16.255 --> 00:56:17.356]  All part of the love.
[00:56:17.436 --> 00:56:19.337]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:56:21.399 --> 00:56:24.902]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey replacement elements.
[00:56:25.143 --> 00:56:28.646]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:56:28.746 --> 00:56:32.229]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed...
[00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:40.032]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.455 --> 00:56:48.095]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.755 --> 00:56:49.796]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.516 --> 00:56:51.676]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.696 --> 00:56:53.117]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.877 --> 00:56:55.778]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.798 --> 00:56:59.099]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.599 --> 00:57:03.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:16.464]  Already in to the second hour of this live Wednesday edition, the second of
[00:57:17.378 --> 00:57:18.919]  July 2003.
[00:57:19.539 --> 00:57:22.801]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com are the websites.
[00:57:23.541 --> 00:57:25.662]  And again, your calls aren't coming up here.
[00:57:26.903 --> 00:57:30.165]  Some more of the news that I have for you.
[00:57:30.225 --> 00:57:31.566]  It's all very important.
[00:57:31.906 --> 00:57:34.867]  Pro-life women shift to majority.
[00:57:36.408 --> 00:57:43.392]  So that shows that the folks out there fighting for the unborn that are being mercilessly killed by this sickening system
[00:57:44.511 --> 00:57:53.058]  That no matter how the propaganda operates, no matter what the media tries, the truth, if you have a highly dedicated group of people, even a minority, can spread to the majority.
[00:57:53.518 --> 00:57:55.499]  And then you can change things and get justice.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.902]  Paul's talking about half of Swiss deaths dubbed suicides.
[00:57:59.382 --> 00:58:02.205]  A bizarre statement about Bush and how our troops are being killed.
[00:58:02.225 --> 00:58:03.245]  He said, bring it on.
[00:58:04.566 --> 00:58:06.188]  As if he's the guy over there fighting.
[00:58:06.248 --> 00:58:13.213]  Just it shows a kind of an arrogance and insanity of this ultra-liberal socialist.
[00:58:14.162 --> 00:58:21.708]  This grower of the federal government to levels basically never before seen.
[00:58:21.728 --> 00:58:25.911]  I want to get into that article as well.
[00:58:27.372 --> 00:58:35.658]  Also, every week there are confirmed cases of the UN and other major organizations running child kidnapping rings.
[00:58:36.359 --> 00:58:38.600]  Well, this is from the Associated Press.
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:42.223]  UN ship carried child prostitutes.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.540]  Being shipped by the U.N.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:45.661]  is their number one business.
[00:58:46.321 --> 00:58:47.901]  Here's another one out of the London Times.
[00:58:48.201 --> 00:58:49.802]  Woman sacked for revealing U.N.
[00:58:49.842 --> 00:58:50.822]  links with sex trade.
[00:58:50.842 --> 00:58:54.823]  And now she's been vindicated in court records showing it is true.
[00:58:54.943 --> 00:58:55.663]  Massive U.N.
[00:58:55.703 --> 00:58:56.764]  child kidnapping ring.
[00:58:57.984 --> 00:58:58.604]  Also, U.N.
[00:58:58.644 --> 00:59:01.185]  troops accused of systematic rape in Sierra Leone.
[00:59:01.205 --> 00:59:03.385]  They, as usual, have photographed their activities.
[00:59:04.686 --> 00:59:05.366]  They like to do that.
[00:59:05.406 --> 00:59:06.186]  That's what they do.
[00:59:07.747 --> 00:59:09.427]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:59:09.867 --> 00:59:12.448]  Bizarre story of a giant sea creature baffles...
[00:59:13.206 --> 00:59:17.847]  Chilean scientists wait to hear about this new life form they think they found.
[00:59:18.668 --> 00:59:22.549]  Some kind of gigantic jellyfish the size of a blue whale or something.
[00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:27.950]  Seven states begin fiscal year with no budget.
[00:59:28.051 --> 00:59:29.331]  All part of the bankruptcy plan.
[00:59:29.351 --> 00:59:30.831]  We'll tell you what's behind that coming up.
[00:59:31.492 --> 00:59:33.252]  Big show today.
[00:59:34.152 --> 00:59:36.913]  And, of course, we're going to have wide open phones.
[00:59:37.553 --> 00:59:39.434]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:59:43.399 --> 00:59:45.119]  All right, now let's go to John in Missouri.
[00:59:45.179 --> 00:59:46.040]  John, you're on the air.
[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:46.480]  Go ahead.
[00:59:46.500 --> 01:00:00.723]  Yeah, Alex, about two weeks ago, me and my girlfriend went to get a shelf on sale at our local slave mart, and you were commenting on the Harry Potter books being released on the summer solstice.
[01:00:01.323 --> 01:00:07.164]  There was about 30 people in a great big circle right in the middle of Walmart, all waiting on the books.
[01:00:08.322 --> 01:00:13.525]  They released those books at 12 midnight, which in the occult world is also called The Witching Hour.
[01:00:13.545 --> 01:00:17.147]  It has great occult significance.
[01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:19.228]  I watched her first two movies.
[01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:21.329]  There's no argument.
[01:00:21.369 --> 01:00:26.872]  There's stuff in there that's in books that I don't even let my neighbor's kids read when they come over.
[01:00:26.892 --> 01:00:27.892]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:00:28.913 --> 01:00:30.474]  Yeah, it's real occult stuff.
[01:00:30.594 --> 01:00:36.737]  I mean, they had a hand of glory in the first one, and if you read about that, that's so thieves can...
[01:00:41.182 --> 01:00:49.630]  Well, they kill the unicorn, which symbolizes a child, symbolizes innocence.
[01:00:50.471 --> 01:00:51.432]  I haven't seen the movies.
[01:00:51.492 --> 01:00:56.536]  I've read two of the books, and it trains kids to have magical thinking to get into the occult.
[01:00:56.556 --> 01:00:57.397]  Sorry?
[01:01:00.203 --> 01:01:00.584]  Go ahead.
[01:01:00.784 --> 01:01:03.586]  I was appalled that my friends were letting their little kids watch it.
[01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:10.733]  I was sitting there going, you guys, I got books at the house with stuff like this in it, you know, that I wouldn't let your kids read if they were over at the house.
[01:01:11.494 --> 01:01:13.215]  I just can't believe it.
[01:01:13.676 --> 01:01:24.126]  Well, for my study for the Bohemian Grove film, I read official black magic books, I mean, stuff written 300 years ago, and that's all of what's in Harry Potter.
[01:01:24.887 --> 01:01:31.930]  And they can deny all day what they do, but the Wiccans and the rest of them are involved in human sacrifice, sacrifice of animals.
[01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:34.832]  That's what their religion did in Europe.
[01:01:35.332 --> 01:01:36.412]  That's the facts.
[01:01:36.872 --> 01:01:38.133]  They can deny it all day.
[01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.534]  That's historical Encyclopedia Britannica fact.
[01:01:43.255 --> 01:01:46.377]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:01:46.637 --> 01:01:48.458]  The Sandian 505P shortwave radio
[01:01:51.863 --> 01:01:52.545]  We're good to go.

[01:02:26.652 --> 01:02:26.932]  Call today.
[01:02:41.761 --> 01:02:46.104]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:50.727]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:55.250]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:56.611]  The New World Order.
[01:02:58.422 --> 01:03:02.645]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:03:02.705 --> 01:03:09.650]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:11.872]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:03:12.132 --> 01:03:22.580]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.201]  If you want to understand what the new world
[01:03:24.281 --> 01:03:25.341]  We're good to go.
[01:03:46.067 --> 01:03:46.547]  We're good to go.
[01:04:02.273 --> 01:04:04.235]  It's such a simple way to make this world a better place.
[01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:27.196]  So call Sherry and the good folks at Arbico today at 1-800-827-2847.
[01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:32.657]  Make sure you got that, 800-827-2847.
[01:04:32.817 --> 01:04:35.978]  Or visit them at www.arbico.com.
[01:04:36.178 --> 01:04:40.419]  Saving the world has never been this simple because Arbico is organic gardening made easy.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:49.581]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:50.181 --> 01:04:53.162]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:58.465]  Alright, my friends, we're back live.
[01:04:58.925 --> 01:05:00.626]  It is Wednesday, the 2nd of July, 2003.
[01:05:01.226 --> 01:05:06.428]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[01:05:08.909 --> 01:05:14.411]  Now, before I go to Mike and Gary and others that are patiently holding, of course, the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:05:14.431 --> 01:05:14.471]  800-259-9231.
[01:05:21.577 --> 01:05:32.081]  I let callers call in about any subject they wish to bring up because it's usually very interesting, and it's a particular news item that I may have forgotten to mention or something I didn't see, and I like to hear about it, and I'm sure the other listeners do.
[01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:37.022]  But occasionally I request that listeners comment on something that I'm discussing.
[01:05:37.582 --> 01:05:40.703]  And that doesn't mean you can't talk about something else, but at least comment on it.
[01:05:42.084 --> 01:05:47.906]  Notice how they announce the Total Information Awareness Network, run by the convicted felon, Admiral John Poindexter,
[01:05:49.534 --> 01:05:51.035]  is going to use the Echelon system.
[01:05:51.055 --> 01:05:53.456]  They're going to call it the Total Information Awareness Network.
[01:05:54.516 --> 01:06:06.022]  They told us in their own public statement six months ago, they're going to watch every movement we make, everything we buy, every phone call we make, every radio show, every transmission, and they say they're going to do it with face scanning cameras.
[01:06:06.582 --> 01:06:17.948]  They say they're going to do it with systems that track our vehicles and track the transponders that have already been put in the new vehicles or that read your license plates.
[01:06:18.621 --> 01:06:21.873]  And they're going to use these giant echelon computers to do it.
[01:06:21.913 --> 01:06:24.341]  They've built FEMA command bunkers in every major city.
[01:06:24.972 --> 01:06:25.332]  We're good to go.
[01:06:56.081 --> 01:06:57.401]  This is federal plans.
[01:06:57.521 --> 01:06:59.262]  I've known about it for six, seven, eight years.
[01:06:59.642 --> 01:07:04.163]  Now it's being announced to you, not just in policy reports.
[01:07:05.264 --> 01:07:13.986]  I talked about how five years ago DARPA announced, with funding, an $840,000 a year upgrade for microphones.
[01:07:16.286 --> 01:07:20.568]  And I linked through to the DARPA website, and they had a test of one of the microphones.
[01:07:21.868 --> 01:07:24.689]  And it said, oh, listen, you can hear a child playing on the street at 200 yards.
[01:07:26.178 --> 01:07:29.560]  And, you know, it gave examples of recordings and how great this is for police.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:41.765]  And they sold to the public, sold as gunshot detectors, and they admitted that, oh, yeah, it's also a great shotgun microphone system that can be rotated and controlled with the camera.
[01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:47.628]  So these are powerful directional microphones.
[01:07:48.268 --> 01:07:49.048]  And they admitted it.
[01:07:50.049 --> 01:07:50.209]  Now...
[01:07:51.551 --> 01:07:56.356]  DARPA just put out a new report because people were up in arms about Total Information Awareness Network.
[01:07:56.376 --> 01:07:57.678]  They'd already put the grid in.
[01:07:58.078 --> 01:08:00.060]  Then they announced it, quote, for your safety.
[01:08:00.441 --> 01:08:01.562]  People got angry.
[01:08:02.223 --> 01:08:04.165]  So they said, okay, there isn't a tips program.
[01:08:04.185 --> 01:08:05.026]  It's called TALEN.
[01:08:05.426 --> 01:08:07.208]  Okay, we're not going to watch everything you do.
[01:08:07.608 --> 01:08:08.930]  As they got their funding increased.
[01:08:09.614 --> 01:08:21.402]  And then they put out a report discussing how this is used to control populations overseas or domestically to track every car, every movement, every face, everything you do, what you buy.
[01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:25.966]  They talk about making shopkeepers plug them into the systems.
[01:08:26.046 --> 01:08:27.226]  Oh, this will stop crime.
[01:08:28.267 --> 01:08:29.248]  It's happening right now.
[01:08:31.317 --> 01:08:32.958]  And I read an AP article, U.S.
[01:08:32.978 --> 01:08:35.300]  Develops Urban Surveillance System, AP.
[01:08:35.701 --> 01:08:42.286]  Here's another AP article just posted, being updated right now, on InfoWars.com, Big Brother U.S.
[01:08:42.367 --> 01:08:43.748]  Wants Surveillance System.
[01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:45.009]  What it says?
[01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:47.891]  Oh, now Big Brother's good, see?
[01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:51.715]  AP, police can envision limited domestic use.
[01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:52.535]  Oh, it's limited.
[01:08:52.936 --> 01:08:57.960]  For an urban surveillance system the Pentagon is developing but doubt they could use it
[01:08:58.689 --> 01:09:02.870]  Could use the full system which is designed to track and analyze the movement of every vehicle in the city.
[01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:05.390]  Dubbed Combat Zones That See.
[01:09:07.691 --> 01:09:09.411]  The project is intended to help the U.S.
[01:09:09.451 --> 01:09:12.031]  military protect troops in fighting cities overseas.
[01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:13.992]  I've read the report.
[01:09:14.732 --> 01:09:15.872]  It's been put in years ago.
[01:09:17.172 --> 01:09:18.393]  It's being used domestically.
[01:09:18.653 --> 01:09:20.173]  The police are admitting they're using it.
[01:09:20.533 --> 01:09:21.633]  But don't worry, it's limited.
[01:09:22.173 --> 01:09:25.514]  Oh yeah, it's limited in San Antonio and Tampa, Florida.
[01:09:26.764 --> 01:09:27.884]  We've had the guest on.
[01:09:27.924 --> 01:09:31.706]  It's been in the news where they come up and just arrest some city worker on the street.
[01:09:31.726 --> 01:09:34.587]  He goes, well, the face scanner said you were a criminal, and it's the wrong person.
[01:09:34.967 --> 01:09:36.527]  Number one, it doesn't even work.
[01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:39.408]  But don't worry.
[01:09:39.428 --> 01:09:40.449]  They say they'll fix that.
[01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:43.790]  They don't mind if you complain about it not working because, oh, they can fix that.
[01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:46.511]  That's about containing the debate about the technology.
[01:09:46.851 --> 01:09:49.772]  Not that it violates the Fourth Amendment, but that, oh, it doesn't work.
[01:09:49.832 --> 01:09:50.292]  Don't worry.
[01:09:50.312 --> 01:09:50.892]  We'll fix it.
[01:09:52.635 --> 01:09:53.415]  And it goes on.
[01:09:53.595 --> 01:09:59.737]  Scientists and privacy experts say the unclassified technology could also easily be adapted to keep tabs on Americans identifying drivers.
[01:10:00.637 --> 01:10:10.200]  The project centerpiece would be groundbreaking computer software capable of automatically identifying vehicles by size, color, shape, and license tag, or drivers and passengers by face.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:17.322]  By the way, this is the same article by the same author, but in the Ohio newspaper...
[01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:24.347]  In the Ohio Beacon Journal, they cut out the first paragraph where the police admit it's domestic.
[01:10:24.767 --> 01:10:27.168]  They cut it out and said it was for overseas.
[01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:39.571]  So I'm looking at editors from CNN posting, as I've been to AP and seen the whole full article, posting the full article, and then I look at the Beacon Journal, and they have cut out pieces.
[01:10:39.651 --> 01:10:40.532]  See how they do that?
[01:10:40.592 --> 01:10:41.532]  How they craft?
[01:10:42.312 --> 01:10:43.353]  How they craft?
[01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:45.673]  It gets worse and worse.
[01:10:46.473 --> 01:10:48.014]  It goes on and on, folks.
[01:10:48.812 --> 01:10:52.053]  Says DARPA's spokesman, John Walker, dismisses the concerns.
[01:10:52.493 --> 01:11:02.575]  She said the combat zones that see CTS's technology isn't intended for homeland security or law enforcement and couldn't be used for other applications without extensive modifications.
[01:11:03.135 --> 01:11:05.636]  That is a bold-faced lie.
[01:11:07.657 --> 01:11:17.499]  I was given a curb six months ago, eight months ago, by a friend in the county of the new Emergency Management Center that's been in place for three and a half years.
[01:11:18.863 --> 01:11:21.525]  They tie into all the cameras, their face scanning.
[01:11:22.105 --> 01:11:23.626]  They tie into the jails.
[01:11:23.686 --> 01:11:24.807]  They tie into the streets.
[01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:26.027]  They tie into the microphones.
[01:11:26.408 --> 01:11:31.471]  I wasn't allowed into some areas of it that are, quote, classified and operated by the federal government.
[01:11:32.291 --> 01:11:37.094]  They operate a concentration camp at the old Robert Mueller Airport.
[01:11:37.154 --> 01:11:39.656]  That's the takeover that I made in 2000.
[01:11:41.777 --> 01:11:42.577]  In police state 2000...
[01:11:45.365 --> 01:11:45.805]  Excuse me.
[01:11:45.845 --> 01:11:54.789]  In Police State 2, the takeover made in 2000, the second film, we show you the admitted local newscast where they go, oh, the troops run this.
[01:11:54.849 --> 01:11:56.689]  It's for overflows and civil emergencies.
[01:11:57.129 --> 01:11:58.590]  This is where they chain you down.
[01:11:58.650 --> 01:11:59.410]  These are the cots.
[01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:00.471]  These are the porta-potties.
[01:12:00.831 --> 01:12:02.151]  Thousands can be held here.
[01:12:02.391 --> 01:12:07.093]  They got hangers, folks, with the Army out there, just hangers, just waiting.
[01:12:07.954 --> 01:12:10.995]  And on top of it, they're building some new FEMA command center at the old airport.
[01:12:11.255 --> 01:12:12.855]  They got some FEMA award for it.
[01:12:13.075 --> 01:12:14.456]  The thing looks like something out of
[01:12:15.211 --> 01:12:16.711]  Out of a science fiction movie.
[01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:23.073]  And they've got the new airport, the Markstrom International Airport.
[01:12:23.093 --> 01:12:24.093]  It was a military base.
[01:12:24.133 --> 01:12:24.833]  Well, it still is.
[01:12:24.853 --> 01:12:26.173]  They're merging the Army.
[01:12:26.253 --> 01:12:29.414]  I have family there in the operation and leadership capacities, okay?
[01:12:30.534 --> 01:12:31.194]  In logistics.
[01:12:31.754 --> 01:12:32.155]  They're there.
[01:12:32.195 --> 01:12:35.535]  They've got drones, helicopters, everything.
[01:12:36.796 --> 01:12:41.016]  And guess who's in the building with the military, under military control?
[01:12:41.817 --> 01:12:43.037]  The APD...
[01:12:44.631 --> 01:12:45.292]  We're good to go.
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:16.769]  But if you want to know what it's going to be used for, go read the Combat Zones That See, Board Agency of DARPA, document number 03-15BAA03-15, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA.
[01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:18.710]  It's on prisonplanet.com.
[01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:21.352]  It's on infowars.com right now.
[01:13:24.154 --> 01:13:30.818]  And then read the two different AP articles written by the same author and then see how they're edited for different audiences.
[01:13:32.057 --> 01:13:34.199]  Learn how the propaganda operates.
[01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:43.807]  And remember the Pentagon said a year and a half ago that they would, quote, set up the Office of Strategic Influence that would, quote, lie to you for your best interest.
[01:13:45.869 --> 01:13:52.014]  So, three years before 9-1-1, we had microphones all over Austin and cameras run by DARPA.
[01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:56.058]  And now it's called Total Information Awareness.
[01:13:57.079 --> 01:13:58.940]  And it's to control entire populations.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:13:59.521]  All right, let's...
[01:14:01.041 --> 01:14:01.841]  Let's go, Coles.
[01:14:02.122 --> 01:14:03.022]  Appreciate folks holding.
[01:14:03.042 --> 01:14:05.043]  Then I'll get into Bush saying, bring it on.
[01:14:05.364 --> 01:14:06.544]  They said the troops are being killed.
[01:14:06.564 --> 01:14:10.907]  He said, bring it on, as if he was there, as if he's Arnold Schwarzenegger or something.
[01:14:11.627 --> 01:14:12.628]  And all the Southern news.
[01:14:13.028 --> 01:14:15.009]  Let's talk to who's up next here.
[01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:17.911]  I guess Mike in Minnesota.
[01:14:18.411 --> 01:14:19.271]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:14:19.332 --> 01:14:19.752]  Go ahead.
[01:14:20.272 --> 01:14:20.652]  Hi, Alex.
[01:14:20.672 --> 01:14:21.253]  How are you doing?
[01:14:21.413 --> 01:14:21.853]  Pretty good.
[01:14:22.413 --> 01:14:22.834]  Pretty good.
[01:14:22.914 --> 01:14:23.974]  Okay, me too.
[01:14:24.014 --> 01:14:25.895]  Well, except for everything that's going on.
[01:14:28.418 --> 01:14:32.905]  There's an old saying, Alex, if you see it on the screen today, it was already done by yesterday.
[01:14:32.925 --> 01:14:34.747]  That's it, yeah.
[01:14:34.788 --> 01:14:35.308]  That's right.
[01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:38.633]  And you're saying it's five years ago.
[01:14:38.653 --> 01:14:42.659]  It has been installed a lot longer ago than people realize.
[01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:44.251]  I'm a little nervous here.
[01:14:44.331 --> 01:14:45.331]  I'm stammering a bit.
[01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:55.758]  Well, Austin, Texas is a medium-sized, you know, million-people metro, and five years ago, an average successive year, they say over 1,000 microphones.
[01:14:56.459 --> 01:14:58.380]  Thousands of microphones?
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.403]  I mean, that's 1984, people, where he hides out in the woods to meet his girlfriend.
[01:15:03.423 --> 01:15:04.364]  Exactly.
[01:15:04.384 --> 01:15:07.286]  And you're not supposed to have a family who can be executed for it.
[01:15:08.001 --> 01:15:12.266]  And he hides out in the woods with her, and the microphone picks him up.
[01:15:12.326 --> 01:15:13.647]  I mean, you know, this is America.
[01:15:13.987 --> 01:15:14.228]  Right.
[01:15:14.308 --> 01:15:20.354]  They just announced up here that they're going to put 25 or 30 surveillance cameras in downtown Minneapolis.
[01:15:20.374 --> 01:15:21.615]  That was a week and a half ago.
[01:15:21.655 --> 01:15:22.496]  Oh, give me a break.
[01:15:22.636 --> 01:15:24.218]  Oh, and Target's paying for that.
[01:15:24.558 --> 01:15:25.379]  Yeah, no doubt.
[01:15:25.419 --> 01:15:26.520]  There's a Target Center here.
[01:15:27.021 --> 01:15:30.264]  Target, Target, let me stop you, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[01:15:30.324 --> 01:15:30.505]  Sure.
[01:15:31.045 --> 01:15:35.929]  Target said, because we care, we're going to pay for these new face scanners.
[01:15:36.650 --> 01:15:37.911]  I've been up in Minneapolis, St.
[01:15:37.951 --> 01:15:38.171]  Paul.
[01:15:38.191 --> 01:15:40.113]  You've got more cameras than almost anybody, sir.
[01:15:40.253 --> 01:15:41.374]  There's a lot of them, I know.
[01:15:41.494 --> 01:15:43.175]  Yeah, but they say 25 in the news.
[01:15:43.215 --> 01:15:43.596]  Go ahead.
[01:15:43.616 --> 01:15:45.537]  Well, that's for downtown Minneapolis alone.
[01:15:45.718 --> 01:15:47.779]  It doesn't include the parks, the highways.
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:49.741]  You can see them all over, driving around.
[01:15:50.422 --> 01:15:55.086]  And, by the way, Camp Ripley, up by Brainerd in northern Minnesota, there is...
[01:15:56.294 --> 01:15:58.677]  There's also a concentration camp.
[01:15:58.717 --> 01:16:01.600]  You can drive by and see the wire pointed in.
[01:16:02.621 --> 01:16:03.963]  Hey, it's more than just that.
[01:16:04.043 --> 01:16:11.432]  I mean, on my website in the new film, I have AP, Reuters, Washington Post, TV stations announcing, you know...
[01:16:12.603 --> 01:16:15.325]  County Commissioner says the feds told him that they're going to use it as a camp.
[01:16:15.405 --> 01:16:16.865]  You know, I mean, it's out in the open.
[01:16:17.366 --> 01:16:17.646]  Yeah.
[01:16:17.686 --> 01:16:20.327]  Rocky Mountain News, incinerators, mass graves.
[01:16:20.487 --> 01:16:21.568]  Incinerators?
[01:16:21.768 --> 01:16:22.088]  I know.
[01:16:22.128 --> 01:16:25.430]  There are 52 concentration camps in California alone.
[01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:26.591]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:16:26.611 --> 01:16:28.151]  I'll let you finish up on the other side, Mike.
[01:16:28.171 --> 01:16:30.853]  Then I'll go to Gary and everybody else.
[01:16:30.873 --> 01:16:32.714]  If you want to join us on air, talk about DARPA.
[01:16:33.234 --> 01:16:35.475]  Talk about the AP saying they got camps for you.
[01:16:35.515 --> 01:16:37.456]  Newsmax saying they got camps for you.
[01:16:37.476 --> 01:16:39.057]  You know, this isn't a rumor, folks.
[01:16:39.557 --> 01:16:40.378]  It's out in the open.
[01:16:43.709 --> 01:16:48.192]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:16:48.552 --> 01:16:52.655]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:52.935 --> 01:16:53.495]  We listened.
[01:16:53.795 --> 01:16:58.778]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:59.059 --> 01:16:59.539]  We listened.
[01:16:59.919 --> 01:17:02.961]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.381 --> 01:17:03.942]  We listened.
[01:17:04.402 --> 01:17:07.804]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:11.005]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium.
[01:17:33.264 --> 01:17:38.288]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:17:38.768 --> 01:17:40.189]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:17:43.612 --> 01:17:49.556]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:17:49.776 --> 01:17:52.038]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:17:52.238 --> 01:17:58.583]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:17:58.903 --> 01:17:59.564]  We're good to go.
[01:18:19.164 --> 01:18:19.644]  We're good to go.
[01:18:41.514 --> 01:18:45.417]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:18:45.637 --> 01:18:57.925]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:18:58.345 --> 01:18:58.745]  The U.S.
[01:18:58.786 --> 01:19:04.369]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:04.769 --> 01:19:06.971]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:08.752 --> 01:19:11.453]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:19:11.473 --> 01:19:14.894]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:19:29.685 --> 01:19:30.106]  We're good to go.
[01:19:40.968 --> 01:19:49.231]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:49.471 --> 01:19:53.832]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:54.112 --> 01:20:03.035]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:20:03.235 --> 01:20:06.876]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:20:07.156 --> 01:20:12.179]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:20:12.479 --> 01:20:19.183]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:20:19.682 --> 01:20:20.202]  We're good to go.
[01:20:49.364 --> 01:20:52.386]  You know, maybe you're driving along in your car for the first time.
[01:20:55.087 --> 01:20:58.909]  You hear me saying that the Rocky Mountain News reported on mass graves and incinerators.
[01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:03.571]  Or you hear me say the AP reported concentration camps for you and your family.
[01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:04.692]  Or that Newsmax did.
[01:21:04.712 --> 01:21:10.415]  Instead of just going, this guy's crazy, why don't you go check it out at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com?
[01:21:10.875 --> 01:21:12.936]  Why don't you get Police State 3 Total Enslavement?
[01:21:13.376 --> 01:21:14.457]  Why don't you get Road to Tyranny?
[01:21:14.837 --> 01:21:18.299]  Why don't you go to a search engine and check it out for yourself?
[01:21:19.443 --> 01:21:20.963]  And, of course, how are they going to get away with it?
[01:21:21.524 --> 01:21:22.944]  Well, it's for emergencies.
[01:21:22.984 --> 01:21:30.766]  When the bio attack comes that the feds say and the CFR says will come, you go, well, why would they do that?
[01:21:30.826 --> 01:21:31.807]  That hurt the economy.
[01:21:32.207 --> 01:21:33.607]  They don't care about the economy.
[01:21:33.627 --> 01:21:42.470]  They want this to be a third world cesspool where you're totally enslaved and they're all in their private armed gated communities overseeing you with their minions.
[01:21:44.091 --> 01:21:45.291]  It's called tyranny, folks.
[01:21:45.351 --> 01:21:47.832]  It happens more often than not in history.
[01:21:48.172 --> 01:22:06.618]  And you lived in the Nile, and you sucked your thumb and watched football and didn't care about your country, and swilled your beer, and so now they're going to take your pension funds, and now they're going to carry out terror, and now they're going to surveil you and satellite track and tax you to drive your car, and you're going to thank them for it, unless you wake up to it.
[01:22:08.279 --> 01:22:11.120]  Mike in Minnesota, let you finish up, and Gary and John and others.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:11.780]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.280]  You're on the air.
[01:22:13.468 --> 01:22:21.254]  You know, you had that story yesterday about the genetics with the fetus, a horrible story about the fetus inside of a cow's uterus.
[01:22:21.955 --> 01:22:23.636]  Well, it goes back to the same thing.
[01:22:23.676 --> 01:22:26.158]  If you see it on the screen today, it was already done by yesterday.
[01:22:26.519 --> 01:22:31.122]  In fact, there are hellish genetic labs in Puerto Rico and all over.
[01:22:31.503 --> 01:22:33.104]  And this is just what they're admitting to.
[01:22:33.504 --> 01:22:36.747]  People have to remember that virtually anything is possible.
[01:22:36.767 --> 01:22:40.230]  We've all been programmed to think, ah, that can't be, it's not possible.
[01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:41.131]  But in fact, it is.
[01:22:41.716 --> 01:22:47.340]  As far as I can tell by my research, the first human being was actually cloned in 1961.
[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.141]  Well, let me break this down for you.
[01:22:49.921 --> 01:22:51.082]  They've been cloning humans.
[01:22:51.262 --> 01:22:53.504]  I've got the BBC headline from four years ago.
[01:22:54.484 --> 01:22:58.087]  Four years ago, they said two years ago, so that was six years ago.
[01:22:59.019 --> 01:23:00.599]  British scientists and U.S.
[01:23:00.679 --> 01:23:02.800]  scientists were cloning embryos.
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.541]  So that's already a human.
[01:23:04.581 --> 01:23:13.543]  They can implant that, bring it to term in a woman or a cow because they want to grow the humanoid larger and then go into new tissue cultures and other things there.
[01:23:13.863 --> 01:23:16.964]  Have the humanoid pod basically grow a whole...
[01:23:17.404 --> 01:23:18.625]  We're good to go.
[01:23:31.731 --> 01:23:42.455]  And spiders that are, or goats that are part spiders producing body armor, mainstream news, and corn with HIV virus in it being planted in 96 locations, spreading into soybeans, AP.
[01:23:43.055 --> 01:23:44.756]  You know, this is all mainstream.
[01:23:44.836 --> 01:23:47.536]  Cockroach genes in the tomatoes on most store shelves.
[01:23:47.897 --> 01:23:49.317]  Salmon genes in corn.
[01:23:49.897 --> 01:23:51.098]  Insanity everywhere.
[01:23:51.118 --> 01:23:54.439]  And then I hear neocons on the air going, those lying liberals.
[01:23:54.779 --> 01:23:56.940]  There's nothing wrong with genetically modified food.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:57.860]  It's no big deal.
[01:23:58.687 --> 01:24:03.370]  Lying, lying, lying, and saying it's liberal to be against this when they're the liberals.
[01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:03.930]  Yeah.
[01:24:04.190 --> 01:24:09.253]  Well, they are liars and murderers to their core, and they'll stop at nothing to achieve their agenda.
[01:24:09.833 --> 01:24:10.734]  And that's another thing.
[01:24:10.774 --> 01:24:16.297]  A few people yesterday had a little trouble believing in this satanic control of our government.
[01:24:16.997 --> 01:24:22.200]  And, you know, they have to know that numbers, you know, symbology is everywhere.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:27.223]  Nine is the number of judgment or completion, and 11 is the number...
[01:24:27.914 --> 01:24:31.297]  Well, when did Bush give his State of the Union to announce a new world order on 9-11?
[01:24:31.337 --> 01:24:32.819]  And, yeah, and of course we've got...
[01:24:50.676 --> 01:24:59.856]  On the one-year anniversary of 9-1-1, the lottery in New York, not in Illinois, not in Texas, comes up 9-1-1, and the Chicago Mercantile...
[01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:05.033]  Came up that day, closed at 9-1-1-0-0-0-0-0.
[01:25:05.674 --> 01:25:09.156]  Never happened 9-1-1, never happened 0-0-0-0.
[01:25:09.496 --> 01:25:11.858]  It was like 1 out of 14 trillion something.
[01:25:12.318 --> 01:25:15.460]  They're just letting you know who runs the speculation markets, aren't they?
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.821]  Yep, they certainly are.
[01:25:16.841 --> 01:25:18.282]  It's all their own little pride.
[01:25:18.362 --> 01:25:19.703]  And people go, what do you mean?
[01:25:19.743 --> 01:25:20.623]  This is getting crazy.
[01:25:21.164 --> 01:25:22.965]  Folks, they admit they go to Skull and Bones.
[01:25:23.005 --> 01:25:24.466]  They admit they go to Bohemian Grove.
[01:25:25.066 --> 01:25:26.307]  Look at the articles I had today.
[01:25:26.767 --> 01:25:27.248]  This is AP.
[01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:29.638]  It's Associated Press when I say AP.
[01:25:30.179 --> 01:25:32.140]  UN ship carried child prostitutes.
[01:25:32.421 --> 01:25:32.881]  Get to that.
[01:25:32.941 --> 01:25:35.443]  A ship full of children bound to slave camps.
[01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:36.204]  AP, folks.
[01:25:36.804 --> 01:25:40.187]  A woman sacked for revealing UN links to child sex trade.
[01:25:40.227 --> 01:25:40.908]  London Times.
[01:25:41.548 --> 01:25:43.850]  UN troops accused of systematic rapacy early on.
[01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:46.773]  Stacks of them every day.
[01:25:47.473 --> 01:25:47.934]  Well, they are.
[01:25:47.954 --> 01:25:49.115]  Every day.
[01:25:49.335 --> 01:25:55.520]  They're killing children, and that brings up another point that not many people know, and I just found out recently also, is that
[01:25:56.429 --> 01:26:01.333]  Another name for Satan in the occult is John Bay.
[01:26:02.093 --> 01:26:04.075]  Take a look at John Benet Ramsey.
[01:26:04.775 --> 01:26:06.056]  You know, there's something there.
[01:26:07.737 --> 01:26:09.899]  I believe she was a child sacrifice.
[01:26:09.939 --> 01:26:11.880]  No one's ever been brought to justice for that either.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.301]  We all got covered up.
[01:26:13.781 --> 01:26:14.822]  Right out in plain view.
[01:26:14.842 --> 01:26:15.482]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:15.522 --> 01:26:16.063]  All right.
[01:26:17.604 --> 01:26:19.685]  Yeah, truth is stranger than fiction, folks.
[01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:21.667]  But, you know, I just read the AP.
[01:26:21.687 --> 01:26:23.308]  You know, slave ships hold children.
[01:26:23.368 --> 01:26:24.969]  I mean, you know, this is your government.
[01:26:26.082 --> 01:26:26.383]  Okay.
[01:26:28.045 --> 01:26:29.627]  I'll come back and we'll take calls.
[01:26:30.027 --> 01:26:30.748]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:26:30.828 --> 01:26:31.830]  Infowars.com.
[01:26:33.091 --> 01:26:34.012]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.493 --> 01:26:36.115]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.016 --> 01:26:39.700]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.842 --> 01:26:44.643]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:26:44.803 --> 01:26:50.447]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:26:50.788 --> 01:26:51.648]  Probably never, right?
[01:26:51.908 --> 01:26:53.430]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here.
[01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:54.010]  My call is 877-605-9200.
[01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.290]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:26:54.330 --> 01:26:54.470]  Music
[01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:22.814]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, we do this show.
[01:27:22.834 --> 01:27:24.515]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:27:24.575 --> 01:27:25.636]  More of your calls coming up.
[01:27:25.676 --> 01:27:31.660]  I'm about to go to Gary and John and Donnie and others that are patiently holding.
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:37.744]  Let me get into some more of this news before I do that, and hopefully some of you will want to discuss DARPA.
[01:27:39.289 --> 01:27:47.111]  The good news is that if people recognize evil and stand up against it, we can change the hearts and minds of those that are undecided and get them involved in the fight against evil.
[01:27:47.131 --> 01:27:49.552]  This is out of the Washington Times today.
[01:27:49.612 --> 01:27:51.712]  Pro-life women shift to majority.
[01:27:53.193 --> 01:27:56.074]  Now, a lot of people say, oh good, they'll ban abortion now, it's the majority.
[01:27:56.354 --> 01:28:03.355]  It wouldn't matter if 98% of people wanted to kill babies in the womb, the 50-something million that have been killed.
[01:28:04.516 --> 01:28:05.156]  It wouldn't matter.
[01:28:06.596 --> 01:28:14.962]  Because if 98% of people wanted to, say, put all white people in slave pens or all black people in slave pens, it still wouldn't mean it was okay.
[01:28:16.351 --> 01:28:20.014]  See, in a democracy, you've got two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:28:20.514 --> 01:28:24.818]  The majority can do whatever they want to you, and the globalists can manipulate that mass.
[01:28:25.158 --> 01:28:38.049]  The mad howl of democracy in a republic, in a constitutional republic, there's a rule of law, a separation of powers, and you don't violate that Bill of Rights or Constitution, so you can't violate people's rights individually, even if the mass wants to.
[01:28:40.611 --> 01:28:46.055]  So whenever you hear a neocon or one of these neoliberals on the air promoting democracy, call them on it.
[01:28:47.017 --> 01:28:52.664]  Pro-life women shift to majority, but it is good news that we're changing minds, affecting society.
[01:28:53.465 --> 01:29:06.481]  The balance between pro-choice women and women who say abortion should be outlawed or severely restricted is shifting towards the pro-life side, bumping that group into the majority in the debate over reproductive rights according to a new national poll.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:17.453]  51% of women surveyed by the Center for the Advancement of Women said the government should prohibit abortion or limit it to extreme cases such as rape, incest, or life-threatening complications.
[01:29:18.154 --> 01:29:20.498]  Oh, so if somebody rapes you, you want to kill the child.
[01:29:20.698 --> 01:29:21.359]  That's real good.
[01:29:21.379 --> 01:29:22.801]  Isn't that an even bigger crime?
[01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:36.576]  The findings, with a 3% margin of error from 1,000 women surveyed, tips the scale from the last sample in 2001, and 45% of women cited against making abortion readily available or imposing only mild restrictions.
[01:29:37.016 --> 01:29:41.418]  Only 30% supported making it generally available, down from 34% in 2001, the survey found.
[01:29:45.586 --> 01:29:50.010]  Well, only 30% support making it generally available, down from 34% in 2001.
[01:29:50.290 --> 01:29:52.172]  See, they were against it in 2001.
[01:29:52.412 --> 01:29:53.593]  They were against it in 2000.
[01:29:53.773 --> 01:30:01.900]  The New York-based center that sponsored the survey is a nonpartisan advocacy group for pro-choice women's rights.
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.022]  So they were going to their people, too, on this.
[01:30:04.062 --> 01:30:06.944]  So it's actually more like 20% that are for murder.
[01:30:06.964 --> 01:30:10.508]  And that's usually young, ignorant people that don't know what it's all about.
[01:30:10.828 --> 01:30:13.210]  Most women who have abortions later are against them, by the way.
[01:30:14.170 --> 01:30:21.795]  The center's president, Faye Waddleton, headed the panel for Planned Parenthood Federation of America for 14 years.
[01:30:21.895 --> 01:30:27.299]  Oh, the Eugenics Society, founded by Margaret Singer, the woman who got awards from Hitler, gave awards from Hitler.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.541]  Got awards, gave awards.
[01:30:29.981 --> 01:30:34.384]  While we do have a certain point of view on women's issues, we do not believe we should suppress information.
[01:30:34.424 --> 01:30:34.644]  Ms.
[01:30:34.805 --> 01:30:40.489]  Waddleton said in an interview yesterday for the Washington Times, you don't want to create false or artificial data.
[01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:43.731]  Spoken like a good Gestapo
[01:30:45.069 --> 01:30:51.830]  So, yeah, the data must remain clean, and yes, most women are against it, but it does not matter.
[01:30:54.591 --> 01:30:58.111]  But that shows that so now it's down to 30% of women are for abortion.
[01:30:58.651 --> 01:31:00.572]  It's 34% a year ago, two years ago.
[01:31:01.752 --> 01:31:05.653]  I mean, we're winning the fight for the hearts and minds, but, you know, it doesn't mean the government stops.
[01:31:05.673 --> 01:31:12.354]  80-plus percent, it's 87%, 89%, depending on the poll, Gallup poll, USA Today, CNN polls.
[01:31:13.846 --> 01:31:19.069]  Which they don't then highly publicize if Americans want the borders shut and illegals deported.
[01:31:19.349 --> 01:31:25.392]  83% of Hispanics, a little lower than blacks and whites, because some have bought into this racial view that it's a racial debate.
[01:31:25.432 --> 01:31:26.533]  It's not and shouldn't be.
[01:31:26.773 --> 01:31:28.013]  The media is trying to make it that.
[01:31:28.694 --> 01:31:29.874]  Want the illegals deported.
[01:31:31.035 --> 01:31:35.898]  But you read the news, it's as if all Hispanics want the border open when 80-plus percent don't.
[01:31:36.918 --> 01:31:38.239]  Again, it's about this illusion.
[01:31:38.839 --> 01:31:42.161]  So you've got 70% of women that are against abortion.
[01:31:43.511 --> 01:31:45.632]  But they still act like everybody wants it.
[01:31:46.833 --> 01:31:47.614]  And it doesn't matter.
[01:31:47.694 --> 01:31:48.414]  Murder is murder.
[01:31:48.434 --> 01:31:50.435]  You could have 98% of reform murder.
[01:31:50.915 --> 01:31:51.996]  Murder is still wrong.
[01:31:54.597 --> 01:31:55.618]  Some of the other news here.
[01:31:55.678 --> 01:31:57.059]  This is out of Scotland.
[01:31:57.319 --> 01:31:58.880]  Scotland on Sunday newspaper.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:07.104]  Half of the swift deaths, dubbed suicide, assisted suicide, plays a role in more than half of all deaths in Switzerland.
[01:32:07.565 --> 01:32:09.586]  Half of the deaths.
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:26.409]  When you talk about a brave new world, Logan's Run, whatever you want to call it, 1984, assisted suicide plays a role in more than half of all deaths in Switzerland, according to a major new study that confirms the country's reputation as the euthanasia capital of Europe.
[01:32:27.309 --> 01:32:35.454]  A survey by the University of Zurich of 5,000 deaths in the country found that 51% were a result of end-of-life decisions.
[01:32:36.249 --> 01:32:42.195]  This would mean that about 31,000 out of 62,000 Swiss citizens who died annually were helped to die by doctors.
[01:32:43.176 --> 01:32:51.484]  And in some of the other Norwegian countries, some of the other Scandinavian countries, they wear toe tags now, little toe rings that say, resuscitate, please don't kill me.
[01:32:52.133 --> 01:33:04.225]  We're trying to make it the law, and we've had Wesley Smith on, Wall Street Journal writer, who documented hundreds of cases of people paralyzed neck down, begging for food, begging for water, being murdered by hospitals by name.
[01:33:04.786 --> 01:33:05.907]  It's now happening here.
[01:33:06.408 --> 01:33:12.354]  And over 70% of those killed by Kevorkian were not permanently ill and were mentally ill.
[01:33:14.832 --> 01:33:19.575]  So, oh, and by the way, Kevorkian lost his medical license for doing things with corpses I can't mention on the air.
[01:33:20.155 --> 01:33:26.438]  He lost it in two separate states by the way, caught in dark rooms with dead bodies.
[01:33:27.258 --> 01:33:28.239]  He is a ghoul.
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:32.121]  So don't tell me it's about somebody's rights.
[01:33:32.781 --> 01:33:35.822]  This isn't about you being allowed to kill yourself, which is bad enough.
[01:33:36.423 --> 01:33:38.363]  This is about killing you!
[01:33:38.383 --> 01:33:43.386]  See all the horrible stuff going on right below your noses?
[01:33:44.375 --> 01:33:48.617]  You don't think they'll put us in camps and have martial law and surveil us in taxes?
[01:33:48.837 --> 01:33:51.238]  They've already killed 54 million kids!
[01:33:55.621 --> 01:33:58.022]  God forgive me for not doing enough to stop it, please.
[01:33:59.523 --> 01:34:01.103]  We're getting judged right now, folks.
[01:34:01.123 --> 01:34:02.324]  We're going to get judged even worse.
[01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:04.085]  You reap what you sow.
[01:34:04.145 --> 01:34:06.126]  It's a law of God's nature.
[01:34:09.227 --> 01:34:12.209]  Of nature's God, as the Declaration of Independence says.
[01:34:14.855 --> 01:34:18.878]  This is the reality of what we face as a society.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.240]  Oh, man.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:26.603]  Let me hit a couple others and we'll go to your calls.
[01:34:28.424 --> 01:34:29.224]  Just a couple more.
[01:34:29.244 --> 01:34:32.006]  Just a couple more here.
[01:34:33.307 --> 01:34:35.668]  World Central Bankers Convene.
[01:34:35.688 --> 01:34:36.889]  This is L.A.
[01:34:36.929 --> 01:34:37.710]  Times, by the way.
[01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:40.331]  See, what I do is I read the headline.
[01:34:40.391 --> 01:34:40.812]  It's L.A.
[01:34:40.852 --> 01:34:43.233]  Times posting a Reuters and Bloomberg news.
[01:34:43.413 --> 01:34:43.954]  There you go.
[01:34:43.994 --> 01:34:44.354]  Let's see.
[01:34:44.853 --> 01:34:45.694]  Give it accurately.
[01:34:46.294 --> 01:34:55.662]  World's central bankers convene attendees at the Bank of International Settlements annual meeting focused on ways to prevent deflation and spur global growth.
[01:34:55.862 --> 01:34:57.303]  You mean global consolidation.
[01:34:58.604 --> 01:35:10.734]  Central bankers from around the world Sunday discuss ways to prevent deflation and kick-start lackluster global growth, including unorthodox policies such as buying up financial assets.
[01:35:12.115 --> 01:35:12.155]  Ah!
[01:35:12.961 --> 01:35:14.382]  So now the world's in trouble.
[01:35:14.462 --> 01:35:23.310]  The bankers, the privately held central bankers owned by just a few families, will print more magic money, add more zeros and ones, and buy up assets to help you.
[01:35:24.231 --> 01:35:25.892]  Oh, how nice of you to consolidate.
[01:35:25.932 --> 01:35:26.693]  Thank you.
[01:35:26.713 --> 01:35:38.503]  In an annual meeting of the Bank of International Settlements, bankers face mounting concerns that falling prices in top industrialized nations could spiral into a deflationary cycle and undermines growth.
[01:35:40.549 --> 01:35:47.591]  Well, the globalists have said years ago in Davos, Switzerland, they wanted to plunge the dollar, create a global recession to, quote, consolidate.
[01:35:48.711 --> 01:35:50.512]  People say the bankers wouldn't hurt the economy.
[01:35:50.532 --> 01:35:51.392]  They want to make money.
[01:35:51.452 --> 01:35:52.352]  Folks, they print the money.
[01:35:52.372 --> 01:35:53.593]  They literally make the money.
[01:35:54.173 --> 01:36:05.076]  It's all about setting you up, getting you over to extended, manipulating speculation markets to make trillions, not billions, and then blowing you out and getting your house, your farm, your ranch, everything you've got.
[01:36:06.974 --> 01:36:07.815]  They wouldn't do that.
[01:36:07.855 --> 01:36:08.696]  That's mean.
[01:36:08.816 --> 01:36:15.102]  Oh, yeah, powerful people that run the world, they got where they are by being humanitarians and not being ruthless.
[01:36:15.162 --> 01:36:16.022]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:36:16.062 --> 01:36:18.845]  Stop being so stupid and naive out there.
[01:36:19.045 --> 01:36:23.069]  You're under massive dehumanization and total attack, people.
[01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:27.092]  They're changing the rules to take your pension funds right in front of you.
[01:36:27.253 --> 01:36:29.535]  They're taking the veterans' health care right now.
[01:36:32.595 --> 01:36:33.515]  Man, this guy's weird.
[01:36:33.535 --> 01:36:34.275]  He gets upset.
[01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:40.677]  Yeah, about taking the veterans' health care, about the veterans getting hit with DU, and the Army's top scientists admitting they're dying from it.
[01:36:40.977 --> 01:36:42.937]  Yeah, and getting hit with sarin and VX nerve gas.
[01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:44.357]  I'm angry about them not getting treatment.
[01:36:44.637 --> 01:36:45.838]  Yeah, I'm angry about the U.N.
[01:36:45.858 --> 01:36:46.318]  and the U.S.
[01:36:46.338 --> 01:36:48.518]  government and dying corps getting caught kidnapping kids.
[01:36:48.718 --> 01:36:49.478]  Mainstream news.
[01:36:49.678 --> 01:36:51.859]  I'm upset about giant public concentration camps.
[01:36:52.079 --> 01:36:57.320]  I'm upset about face-scanning cameras in DARPA and the Pentagon saying they're going to run our society and put troops on the streets.
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:05.102]  I'm upset about Bush signing on to UNESCO, saying their job is to break up the family and the families of disease, their official policy report.
[01:37:07.043 --> 01:37:08.103]  Yeah, you bet I'm upset.
[01:37:08.143 --> 01:37:18.986]  I'm real upset about police in black ski masks and black uniforms and armored vehicles and giant prisons everywhere, the number one part of our economy, and RFID tracking chips going in most of the products, and the borders being wide open.
[01:37:21.159 --> 01:37:22.360]  You bet I'm upset.
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:30.344]  Seven states going bankrupt right now by design so they can be federalized, so they can increase their control and jack up the taxes.
[01:37:33.366 --> 01:37:35.247]  Folks, you're in the real world now.
[01:37:35.667 --> 01:37:37.047]  And the neocons are busy.
[01:37:37.208 --> 01:37:38.828]  All they talk about is Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:39.309 --> 01:37:40.389]  And what a traitor she is.
[01:37:40.449 --> 01:37:43.471]  Funny, she's got an exact voting record with George W. Bush.
[01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:44.992]  Exactly the same.
[01:37:45.672 --> 01:37:46.252]  I'm sorry.
[01:37:46.653 --> 01:37:48.073]  Barbara Boxer is more conservative.
[01:37:48.093 --> 01:37:49.254]  She was for arming all pilots.
[01:37:50.001 --> 01:37:51.642]  Actually, they're more conservative than Bush.
[01:37:51.662 --> 01:37:52.082]  I'm sorry.
[01:37:53.242 --> 01:37:54.383]  It's just all about Hillary.
[01:37:54.423 --> 01:37:55.023]  What idiots.
[01:37:55.083 --> 01:37:55.783]  Jesse Jackson.
[01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:57.844]  Just this dog and pony show distraction.
[01:38:00.425 --> 01:38:02.145]  All right, let's go to some calls.
[01:38:02.285 --> 01:38:05.627]  I've got to get control of myself here.
[01:38:05.667 --> 01:38:06.807]  This is out of control, though.
[01:38:09.268 --> 01:38:10.248]  Gary in Ohio.
[01:38:10.288 --> 01:38:11.129]  Gary, you're on the air.
[01:38:11.169 --> 01:38:11.629]  Go ahead.
[01:38:12.109 --> 01:38:12.429]  Hey, Alex.
[01:38:12.469 --> 01:38:13.429]  How are you doing today?
[01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:14.570]  Fired up.
[01:38:14.810 --> 01:38:15.810]  Yeah, I hear that.
[01:38:16.210 --> 01:38:17.471]  Hey, about DARPA.
[01:38:18.719 --> 01:38:20.863]  We all know these folks are professional liars.
[01:38:21.544 --> 01:38:27.012]  And every time, you know, I notice they keep using these modifying words, slightly, maybe, sort of, kind of.
[01:38:27.433 --> 01:38:29.717]  Every time I hear that, I hope they're lying to us again.
[01:38:30.382 --> 01:38:40.570]  Well, they say in the AP that the police are going to use it to watch us, the face scanners, the car scanners, the plate scanners, and the government and the Pentagon are putting it in, and the Army runs it.
[01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:42.932]  Then they say, but it won't be used for everything.
[01:38:43.032 --> 01:38:44.753]  And then their own report says it will.
[01:38:45.133 --> 01:38:47.555]  You know, it's like local cable television.
[01:38:47.595 --> 01:38:52.759]  How long is it going to be before they're looking at everything we're watching?
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.461]  You know, like you were talking about bank accounts, all that information.
[01:38:55.481 --> 01:38:56.302]  Sir, let me stop you.
[01:38:57.126 --> 01:39:00.147]  I got a three-year-old article, a two-year-old article, a year-old article.
[01:39:00.167 --> 01:39:01.008]  I got a bunch of articles.
[01:39:01.328 --> 01:39:05.949]  They're in Police State, Three Total Enslavement, Mainstream, MSNBC, AP, Reuters.
[01:39:06.930 --> 01:39:17.754]  The Atlantic Scientific Digital Cable Box, in most homes now that have cable, tracks everything you watch and creates detailed psychological algorithms that are then sold to the government and others.
[01:39:18.294 --> 01:39:19.774]  It doesn't watch what you watch.
[01:39:19.814 --> 01:39:21.335]  It doesn't physically watch you.
[01:39:21.635 --> 01:39:22.175]  It's worse.
[01:39:22.295 --> 01:39:23.716]  It pierces your mind.
[01:39:26.539 --> 01:39:30.540]  Yeah, well, I knew I'd heard that from somewhere, and now I remember, and it was from you.
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:52.185]  But what I wanted to also talk about is I recently re-watched Schindler's List, and I found myself... And the bad Nazis have checkpoints and check papers, but now we're going to do it, but it's for seatbelts and rigging and driving, but their own policy report funding it says it's to search cars to prepare us for internal checkpoints.
[01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:54.146]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[01:39:54.699 --> 01:39:56.860]  It's a whole Nazi regime thing all over again.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:57.680]  It's an Amber Alert?
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:00.081]  It's publicly an EAS FEMA takeover system.
[01:40:00.301 --> 01:40:01.341]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:01.741 --> 01:40:09.503]  And I found myself looking at some of the pictures of the websites about the Holocaust, about looking at the pictures of the camps, in other words.
[01:40:10.264 --> 01:40:21.527]  And I thought to myself, and I thought of you when I was looking at these, and I thought to myself, how long is it going to be before we find ourselves in this kind of position that we don't get this thing somehow resolved?
[01:40:22.150 --> 01:40:32.333]  Get this thing, you know, get people awake because all you got to do is look at the pictures, Auschwitz, Mount Hatton, all those, they're still there.
[01:40:32.633 --> 01:40:35.714]  And the pictures are, the evidence is there.
[01:40:36.414 --> 01:40:42.336]  And you know what they say, people who don't learn from history will repeat it.
[01:40:42.356 --> 01:40:45.317]  And somehow...
[01:40:46.016 --> 01:40:49.062]  People don't remember that absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:40:49.102 --> 01:40:51.527]  They just deny history and deny their responsibility.
[01:40:51.547 --> 01:40:52.249]  But here's the deal.
[01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:59.732]  They tried to announce the tips program that your cable guy, your neighbor, the phone man, everyone will tattle and spy on you.
[01:40:59.772 --> 01:41:03.573]  And the report said it's going to be for guns, drugs, family violence.
[01:41:03.633 --> 01:41:05.213]  See, terror is everything now.
[01:41:05.994 --> 01:41:07.454]  There's not any real terrorists.
[01:41:07.534 --> 01:41:09.155]  It's all CIA here and there.
[01:41:09.175 --> 01:41:10.195]  Few attacks.
[01:41:10.555 --> 01:41:16.917]  So there's nothing to do with the billboards and the TV ads and the tattle numbers and the citizens and the Homeland Security taking over to
[01:41:16.937 --> 01:41:18.218]  I mean, it's just la-la land lying.
[01:41:18.638 --> 01:41:21.381]  So many lies you can't counter them all.
[01:41:45.828 --> 01:41:49.010]  And now it's back with increased funding called Project Talon.
[01:41:49.050 --> 01:41:51.812]  That was mainstream news on Monday on Infowars.com.
[01:41:53.132 --> 01:41:58.336]  DARPA put this in, said it was for watching us, controlling us, a cashless society monitoring system.
[01:41:58.396 --> 01:41:59.456]  I call it a control grid.
[01:41:59.796 --> 01:42:01.037]  Now they announce it today.
[01:42:02.018 --> 01:42:04.759]  They say, okay, there's no total information awareness network.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.302]  We're going to increase the funding for the terrorism information awareness network.
[01:42:09.262 --> 01:42:12.944]  And our symbol is still going to be a pyramid, you know, with an all-seeing eye.
[01:42:13.465 --> 01:42:13.685]  So...
[01:42:15.522 --> 01:42:16.604]  It's just incredible, sir.
[01:42:16.744 --> 01:42:20.989]  I mean, it's like Ashcroft saying, Patriot Act I doesn't affect citizens, then admitting it did.
[01:42:21.269 --> 01:42:23.992]  There's no Patriot Act II, then proposing it three weeks ago.
[01:42:24.012 --> 01:42:27.256]  I mean, it's wall-to-wall lying, sir.
[01:42:27.276 --> 01:42:28.557]  You bet it is.
[01:42:28.958 --> 01:42:33.423]  And it must have been very much the same way in Nazi Germany at the beginning.
[01:42:33.923 --> 01:42:34.945]  But here's the good news.
[01:42:35.606 --> 01:42:38.887]  Yeah, it seems to me the only real terrorists that we have in this country are the people's elements.
[01:42:59.344 --> 01:43:00.205]  Of the U.S.
[01:43:00.325 --> 01:43:01.186]  government today.
[01:43:23.467 --> 01:43:30.230]  They're setting up the $6.3 billion a year bureaucracy for forcible injection, page 76, of Homeland Security, known as BioShield.
[01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:33.131]  It is a world so nightmarish.
[01:43:33.892 --> 01:43:35.372]  It is Hades on Earth.
[01:43:35.432 --> 01:43:36.053]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:37.113 --> 01:43:37.433]  You too.
[01:43:37.493 --> 01:43:40.495]  We'll come back and talk to John and Don and others.
[01:43:41.475 --> 01:43:42.435]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[01:43:42.476 --> 01:43:43.416]  It's all mainstream.
[01:43:43.876 --> 01:43:44.857]  It's all in your face.
[01:43:46.477 --> 01:43:47.678]  I pray your eyes will be opened.
[01:43:47.718 --> 01:43:48.718]  I pray you'll become leaders.
[01:43:48.778 --> 01:43:50.039]  I pray you'll get upset about this.
[01:43:51.053 --> 01:43:51.674]  We're good to go.
[01:43:51.715 --> 01:43:52.115]  We're good to go.
[01:44:04.048 --> 01:44:04.508]  We're good to go.
[01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:34.150]  You're mine.
[01:44:34.971 --> 01:44:38.172]  The data collection ports that God gave you.
[01:44:38.873 --> 01:44:39.613]  I'm begging you.
[01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:40.234]  Wake up.
[01:44:42.375 --> 01:44:43.375]  Have a cold sweat.
[01:44:44.095 --> 01:44:45.236]  Realize you're under attack.
[01:44:45.316 --> 01:44:46.297]  Realize there's a war.
[01:44:46.377 --> 01:44:47.397]  Realize we're under attack.
[01:44:47.417 --> 01:44:48.618]  We're under bombardment.
[01:44:48.898 --> 01:44:50.159]  We're under attack.
[01:44:50.199 --> 01:44:51.199]  We're being hit.
[01:44:51.239 --> 01:44:52.700]  It's like Pearl Harbor.
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.141]  Man the guns in the info war.
[01:44:55.341 --> 01:44:55.801]  Alert!

[01:46:03.354 --> 01:46:06.816]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:46:07.076 --> 01:46:10.598]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:46:10.678 --> 01:46:14.620]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:21.003]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:21.404 --> 01:46:29.328]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:46:29.728 --> 01:46:30.630]  We're good to go.
[01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:48.293]  You get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:46:48.333 --> 01:46:54.981]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:46:55.042 --> 01:46:57.024]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:47:02.074 --> 01:47:06.421]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:06.601 --> 01:47:11.028]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:11.188 --> 01:47:15.595]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:47:15.635 --> 01:47:16.937]  The New World Order.
[01:47:18.739 --> 01:47:22.940]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:29.943]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:47:30.083 --> 01:47:32.164]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:32.444 --> 01:47:42.568]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:47:43.068 --> 01:47:48.433]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:47:48.954 --> 01:47:51.576]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:47:51.596 --> 01:47:52.157]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:47:52.197 --> 01:47:52.717]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:47:52.737 --> 01:47:53.998]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:48:06.704 --> 01:48:07.204]  Don't worry.
[01:48:07.685 --> 01:48:09.206]  This show is documented.
[01:48:09.726 --> 01:48:15.590]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:16.131 --> 01:48:29.260]  Because the average cop, the average fireman, the average detective is a good person, the average CIA officer is even a good person, you know, doing analysis on Cuban rocket photographs or whatever.
[01:48:29.978 --> 01:48:32.079]  They think, oh, the whole system isn't like that.
[01:48:32.179 --> 01:48:34.500]  Folks, I scan where they're caught every day.
[01:48:34.861 --> 01:48:41.224]  It is so much evil, so much red-handed, just total wickedness that I can't cover it at all.
[01:48:41.304 --> 01:48:42.645]  I mean, it is so horrible.
[01:48:43.045 --> 01:48:48.848]  I'll be looking at an AP or Reuters story or an admission or a court transcript, and I can't believe what I'm seeing.
[01:48:50.225 --> 01:48:55.349]  We're about to go to John and Donnie and others that are holding.
[01:48:55.749 --> 01:49:01.813]  And in the third hour, making Mike come on, Mike Hanson, the third hour, 30 minutes into the third hour, Mike's coming on.
[01:49:02.254 --> 01:49:03.915]  He apprehended the three thugs.
[01:49:03.995 --> 01:49:06.597]  One of them ran off, but he apprehended them trying to rob him.
[01:49:06.897 --> 01:49:09.639]  He got his gun and stopped them in his underwear.
[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:13.222]  And the police, Travis County, came by and thanked him.
[01:49:13.242 --> 01:49:17.525]  He solved 20 serious burglaries by what he did.
[01:49:18.968 --> 01:49:23.411]  An example of what the Second Amendment and citizen action is all about against real crime.
[01:49:25.012 --> 01:49:26.633]  So that's coming up in about 35 minutes.
[01:49:26.673 --> 01:49:28.654]  We're about to go to John and Doug and others.
[01:49:30.255 --> 01:49:34.117]  But before I do that, please get my videos.
[01:49:34.197 --> 01:49:36.479]  Please get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:37.059 --> 01:49:38.620]  Man the guns in the Info War.
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:39.300]  Get the film.
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:40.321]  Make 100 copies.
[01:49:41.322 --> 01:49:46.865]  I mean, in a month and a half, if you make two videos a day, one when you go to work, one when you go to bed, copies of it,
[01:49:47.758 --> 01:49:55.962]  You can get out 100 videos to county commissioners, sheriffs, sheriff's deputies, the police chief, the city council, the local talk stations.
[01:49:57.643 --> 01:49:59.584]  It's a labor of love for this country.
[01:49:59.624 --> 01:50:07.948]  If we don't expose who the terrorists are, what they're doing, show people their crimes, then the compartmentalized mass isn't going to wake up.
[01:50:08.769 --> 01:50:10.569]  It is such a desperate fight we're in right now.
[01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:11.370]  Please help me.
[01:50:12.676 --> 01:50:14.637]  The videos are $25.95 apiece.
[01:50:14.657 --> 01:50:15.657]  They're all over two hours.
[01:50:15.677 --> 01:50:18.717]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the nine videos.
[01:50:19.177 --> 01:50:20.438]  Road to Tyranny is on 911.
[01:50:20.858 --> 01:50:21.978]  Masters of Terror as well.
[01:50:22.018 --> 01:50:23.178]  My book is Descent into Tyranny.
[01:50:23.478 --> 01:50:24.638]  Police State 3 is out.
[01:50:25.599 --> 01:50:27.579]  It's two hours and 40 minutes long.
[01:50:27.619 --> 01:50:28.899]  It's an amazing film.
[01:50:28.939 --> 01:50:30.840]  I mean, I just can't describe what's in it, okay?
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:31.320]  Just get it.
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:35.041]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:35.481 --> 01:50:37.241]  These are the tools that are waking up.
[01:50:38.396 --> 01:50:42.222]  90% of those that see them, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:42.262 --> 01:50:48.711]  I do a calm, focused analysis in all the films, video, world leaders admitting they're terrorists.
[01:50:48.772 --> 01:50:49.613]  I mean, it's just all there.
[01:50:51.498 --> 01:50:53.339]  1-888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to order.
[01:50:53.439 --> 01:50:53.859]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:53.879 --> 01:50:56.881]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:50:56.961 --> 01:50:57.341]  Please take action.
[01:50:57.361 --> 01:50:58.261]  Call, order today.
[01:50:58.402 --> 01:50:59.502]  Go to the website and order.
[01:50:59.602 --> 01:51:02.403]  Let's talk to John in Florida, and we'll go to Donnie.
[01:51:20.692 --> 01:51:21.072]  Or Don.
[01:51:21.453 --> 01:51:22.073]  Go ahead, John.
[01:51:22.093 --> 01:51:24.414]  Good to talk to you, John.
[01:51:25.215 --> 01:51:25.615]  Is that me?
[01:51:25.815 --> 01:51:26.175]  Yes, sir.
[01:51:26.736 --> 01:51:27.276]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:51:27.396 --> 01:51:29.818]  I hope you'll hold me over because I've got several things to tell you.
[01:51:30.338 --> 01:51:33.840]  Oh, yeah, you're calling from, not Florida, from England.
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:35.221]  Go ahead.
[01:51:35.521 --> 01:51:42.005]  Firstly, last week, I know you covered it, the comedy terrorist that we had that broke into Prince William's birthday party.
[01:51:43.226 --> 01:51:45.607]  Firstly, I think he was let in deliberately.
[01:51:46.148 --> 01:51:48.469]  Now we're calling him a terrorist because he crashed a party.
[01:51:49.187 --> 01:51:49.868]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:49.908 --> 01:51:50.768]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:51:50.888 --> 01:51:52.730]  Now closing party, secret execution.
[01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:53.070]  Yeah.
[01:51:53.330 --> 01:51:56.312]  It was on the front page of the newspapers for three days, and I wondered why.
[01:51:56.593 --> 01:51:57.433]  And then I found out.
[01:51:57.734 --> 01:51:58.874]  I sent you an email about this.
[01:51:59.335 --> 01:52:11.404]  The shadow Home Secretary, who is the opposition spokesman for Home Affairs, who is basically opposite the Home Secretary, he called for, he said, this shows we need a department for Homeland Security.
[01:52:12.364 --> 01:52:19.486]  This is a gentleman by the name of Oliver Letwin, who is the Managing Director of Rothschild Investment Banking UK.
[01:52:19.606 --> 01:52:23.787]  Well, they always, yeah, that's NM, Rothschild.
[01:52:23.847 --> 01:52:30.089]  Now, of course, this is all to protect your German dictator, that horrible rat family you have in there.
[01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:31.169]  I mean, aren't you sick of them?
[01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:32.169]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:32.189 --> 01:52:33.390]  Well, I've got more to tell you.
[01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:34.350]  Okay, well, stay there.
[01:52:34.690 --> 01:52:38.851]  What do you think of your degenerate German skull and bones family?
[01:52:40.672 --> 01:52:41.632]  What do you think of them, John?
[01:52:43.431 --> 01:52:44.372]  Must have him on hold.
[01:52:44.672 --> 01:52:45.553]  All right, stay there, John.
[01:52:45.573 --> 01:52:47.635]  We'll come back to you in the third hour.
[01:52:48.215 --> 01:52:49.176]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:52:49.456 --> 01:52:51.097]  Get my videos and make copies.
[01:52:51.117 --> 01:52:51.758]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:53:02.546]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:53:02.767 --> 01:53:11.774]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.308 --> 01:53:19.948]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.609 --> 01:53:21.650]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:23.531]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.152 --> 01:53:24.952]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.713 --> 01:53:26.613]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.633 --> 01:53:31.037]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.457 --> 01:53:35.580]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:38.602 --> 01:53:41.264]  The Sachs-Coburg Gophers.
[01:53:42.205 --> 01:53:42.365]  The...
[01:53:43.698 --> 01:53:58.044]  Merovingian family that sits there nesting in England, sucking off all the central banks, running giant war machines, eugenics programs, writing books written by the royal family how they want to kill 80% of us.
[01:53:58.604 --> 01:54:06.147]  They're little carrot-top demon princes nesting there with their bug eyes, little rodents.
[01:54:06.887 --> 01:54:08.068]  We're good to go.
[01:54:23.398 --> 01:54:24.339]  Go ahead, John.
[01:54:24.359 --> 01:54:26.401]  You were finishing up about the Rat Prince.
[01:54:28.182 --> 01:54:32.085]  You must give up all your liberty to protect the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas.
[01:54:32.406 --> 01:54:40.852]  And most of the British people are so brainwashed, they don't even know about their operational dictatorship family that's dominated their country and turned it into a cesspool.
[01:54:40.872 --> 01:54:41.293]  Go ahead.
[01:54:42.085 --> 01:54:42.686]  Yeah.
[01:54:43.086 --> 01:54:51.372]  Well, they're now using this to draw up a watch list for attention seekers, basically, which is anyone who's trying to bring information to the public.
[01:54:51.753 --> 01:54:53.854]  So I'm rather disconcerted about that.
[01:54:53.894 --> 01:54:55.836]  But I've been busy over the last few days.
[01:54:55.876 --> 01:54:58.038]  I've been speaking to members of Parliament.
[01:54:58.098 --> 01:55:09.487]  I actually saw today I met with a very senior member of Parliament who is independently minded, and I personally respect him because he's shown his independence, and he is a very well-respected member of Parliament.
[01:55:09.907 --> 01:55:12.551]  I also met today with two BBC journalists.
[01:55:25.854 --> 01:55:37.264]  And one of them I spoke to about 9-11, and both of them I spoke to about Sherman Skolnick's story about the Bush family bribing Tony Blair with several billion dollars.
[01:55:37.685 --> 01:55:43.270]  I spoke to Sherman myself on Sunday, and he said to me, believe it, it's true, it's just they're sitting on it.
[01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:47.553]  I mean, I've followed some of Sherman's work, and yeah, a lot of it is uncooperated.
[01:55:47.853 --> 01:55:53.117]  But I have also seen through the mainstream how other elements of his stories have been shown to be true.
[01:55:53.557 --> 01:56:00.963]  And I just passed this information on to the BBC and also to these members of Parliament and said, it's not me saying this, it's this guy.
[01:56:01.303 --> 01:56:01.884]  Check him out.
[01:56:02.264 --> 01:56:03.124]  Check out the story.
[01:56:03.165 --> 01:56:11.711]  Well, I would go to the BBC and say, your Times of London reported that Salman Rushdie was told not to fly that month to New York.
[01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:13.751]  It was a ban for his safety.
[01:56:14.672 --> 01:56:19.536]  Mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, told not to fly that day for his safety to New York.
[01:56:20.277 --> 01:56:23.059]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff, MSNBC, were told not to fly that day.
[01:56:23.139 --> 01:56:24.360]  They weren't even in on it.
[01:56:25.283 --> 01:56:41.170]  Yeah, but unfortunately, everyone is wandering around in a trance, not questioning the fact that no one has... I mean, I was listening to a show from Cloak & Dagger last night, and someone phoned in and said, so what is the official explanation for why those fighter jets didn't take off on time?
[01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:43.751]  And Lenny Bloom's response was, now you're getting there.
[01:56:43.791 --> 01:56:45.211]  There never was an explanation.
[01:56:45.491 --> 01:56:46.932]  And this is what I'm trying to explain to them.
[01:56:47.252 --> 01:56:47.812]  Check it out.
[01:56:48.392 --> 01:56:49.813]  Forget about what you think you know.
[01:56:49.833 --> 01:56:54.495]  Go and check it out and just see for yourself the fact that the story does not fit together.
[01:56:54.935 --> 01:57:02.497]  Now, I have to say I'm quietly optimistic about this senior member of Parliament I met with today, because he's shown his independence.
[01:57:02.537 --> 01:57:06.238]  I don't want to mention his name at this stage, because he's just had this information.
[01:57:06.298 --> 01:57:15.740]  So we don't need some whole wild story in the press about how this guy's involved with conspiracy theorists until he can see it for himself and come out and make his own assertions.
[01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:17.861]  Let me just say this, John.
[01:57:18.641 --> 01:57:19.681]  Members of Parliament...
[01:57:20.367 --> 01:57:26.353]  Members of Congress here should be knee-deep in documents, news stories, videotapes, and we can't do it all.
[01:57:26.534 --> 01:57:27.615]  John can't do it.
[01:57:28.696 --> 01:57:29.537]  I can't do it alone.
[01:57:29.737 --> 01:57:32.760]  Everybody's got to do a little something every day, every week.
[01:57:33.501 --> 01:57:35.463]  Alex, I saw my own MP on Saturday.
[01:57:35.743 --> 01:57:37.385]  He did not want to talk to me about politics.
[01:57:38.587 --> 01:57:55.203]  I went to his constituency surgery, and people normally turn up to talk about benefit claims or an asylum claim, and when I said I want to talk to you about the lies that we've got and the war in Iraq and political corruption, he tried to tell me this wasn't the right forum, and I reminded him this is the only access that I have to my elected representatives.
[01:57:55.223 --> 01:58:02.931]  For those that don't know, your members of parliament come and you talk to them in little meetings, and you didn't want to talk about politics because members of parliament aren't involved in politics, huh, John?
[01:58:03.749 --> 01:58:05.793]  Thanks for the call.
[01:58:06.274 --> 01:58:07.476]  Yeah, that's the way it is around here.
[01:58:07.496 --> 01:58:11.965]  All right, we'll come back and talk to Don and Perry and others.
[01:58:12.045 --> 01:58:13.187]  A lot of other news coming up.
[01:58:13.207 --> 01:58:13.567]  Stay with me.
[01:58:15.621 --> 01:58:19.524]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:58:19.764 --> 01:58:25.188]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:58:25.468 --> 01:58:35.835]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:58:35.995 --> 01:58:40.338]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:58:40.538 --> 01:58:48.903]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:58:49.163 --> 01:58:55.446]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odor.
[01:58:55.506 --> 01:58:55.866]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:59:16.104 --> 01:59:23.472]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:23.753 --> 01:59:28.498]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:28.718 --> 01:59:34.365]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:34.605 --> 01:59:35.325]  We're good to go.
[01:59:53.955 --> 02:00:00.716]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:01:05.527 --> 02:01:06.448]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:26.559 --> 02:01:28.040]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:31.783]  Let's talk to Don in Missouri and Perry and others.
[02:01:31.864 --> 02:01:33.125]  Or Don in Michigan.
[02:01:33.165 --> 02:01:34.346]  I'm trying to get these states right.
[02:01:35.006 --> 02:01:36.668]  These states right.
[02:01:37.228 --> 02:01:38.289]  Oh, look, a Freudian slip.
[02:01:38.329 --> 02:01:39.730]  I said states rights.
[02:01:41.432 --> 02:01:42.332]  Don, you're on the air.
[02:01:42.372 --> 02:01:42.753]  Go ahead.
[02:01:42.773 --> 02:01:43.954]  How are you doing today, brother?
[02:01:44.114 --> 02:01:44.754]  Pretty good, sir.
[02:01:45.075 --> 02:01:45.275]  Good.
[02:01:45.828 --> 02:01:50.531]  I've told you before, I've never been knighted by the British, so you don't have to call me sir, but I appreciate the respect.
[02:01:50.591 --> 02:01:52.533]  Well, it's just a pleasantry.
[02:01:52.653 --> 02:01:53.673]  I know, Alex, I know.
[02:01:54.114 --> 02:01:55.635]  Listen, I've asked you about this before.
[02:01:55.655 --> 02:02:02.299]  I haven't called in a month or so or whatever, but you used to play this audio piece, Martial Law, and it's an audio.
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:05.361]  Back in the 80s, somebody made it up.
[02:02:05.821 --> 02:02:06.962]  Jell-O Biafra, yeah.
[02:02:07.282 --> 02:02:07.683]  What is it?
[02:02:09.944 --> 02:02:11.145]  It's called Jell-O Biafra.
[02:02:11.890 --> 02:02:16.192]  Yeah, it's the name of a spoken word group that does political things.
[02:02:16.892 --> 02:02:18.533]  Well, I was looking on the Internet.
[02:02:18.553 --> 02:02:20.734]  I was trying to find that because I was going to download that.
[02:02:20.794 --> 02:02:21.514]  That's kind of nippy.
[02:02:21.534 --> 02:02:30.398]  I was going to play it for a couple of my buddies who just don't get it yet what a scenario would be like under total martial law.
[02:02:30.539 --> 02:02:31.159]  We're already under it.
[02:02:31.179 --> 02:02:32.119]  It's just incrementally.
[02:02:32.259 --> 02:02:35.361]  I was wondering about that, Alex.
[02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:38.862]  I keep getting requests to play it, and I...
[02:02:40.951 --> 02:02:43.032]  I'll play it for you, okay?
[02:02:43.332 --> 02:02:44.773]  I'll get that done soon.
[02:02:45.933 --> 02:02:49.855]  I'll play it a couple times next week or something, or maybe tomorrow.
[02:02:50.816 --> 02:02:51.536]  Well, I appreciate it.
[02:02:51.556 --> 02:02:52.677]  I've got to be honest with you.
[02:02:52.697 --> 02:02:59.880]  I've got the CD right here, and I've been playing this for about eight years, and the CD is scratched and messed up.
[02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:01.021]  I don't care about that.
[02:03:01.041 --> 02:03:01.641]  Well, hold on.
[02:03:01.821 --> 02:03:04.042]  I'm not going to air a CD that skips on air.
[02:03:04.322 --> 02:03:04.622]  Oh, okay.
[02:03:04.702 --> 02:03:05.663]  But let me finish.
[02:03:06.523 --> 02:03:08.504]  I've had this thing, I don't know, seven, eight years.
[02:03:09.225 --> 02:03:09.665]  The CD...
[02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:15.343]  I spilt coffee on the table, got on a bunch of CDs.
[02:03:15.383 --> 02:03:23.827]  When I cleaned them, they all worked, but this one, the CD is now shot, and so I have to go out and find it and buy it again.
[02:03:25.168 --> 02:03:30.471]  Now, if somebody wants to go out and buy the CD for me and mail it to me, the sale airs in the next few days.
[02:03:30.551 --> 02:03:31.812]  I'll never get time to go to the...
[02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:37.710]  To go to the record store, or the CD store, or the music store.
[02:03:38.471 --> 02:03:40.991]  And even if I did, they probably won't have it.
[02:03:41.111 --> 02:03:45.293]  So if people want to hear it, how about somebody overnights it to me, and then you'll hear it?
[02:03:46.593 --> 02:03:48.034]  Well, if I could find it someplace.
[02:03:48.494 --> 02:03:49.494]  A lot of people have got it.
[02:03:49.914 --> 02:03:52.355]  I'm just saying, the CD's messed up.
[02:03:52.375 --> 02:03:53.395]  That's why I haven't been airing it.
[02:03:53.735 --> 02:03:55.276]  Okay, well, that's no big deal.
[02:03:55.296 --> 02:03:56.136]  How are you doing?
[02:03:56.236 --> 02:03:56.996]  Everything going okay?
[02:03:57.477 --> 02:03:58.257]  Oh, yeah, I'm...
[02:04:00.043 --> 02:04:00.824]  I'm doing all right.
[02:04:01.124 --> 02:04:12.133]  To try to cover the wall-to-wall lying and manipulation and to watch, according to people's political paradigm, the most liberal administration ever in U.S.
[02:04:12.173 --> 02:04:27.365]  history, the biggest growth of the federal government, the greatest loss of sovereignty and rights and liberties, systematic evil being set up and worked upon us, and then to have to listen to neocons everywhere lying about it and to hear mindless idiots supporting them is very painful.
[02:04:27.825 --> 02:04:29.628]  Well, we all knew Clinton was a common criminal.
[02:04:30.009 --> 02:04:33.014]  But Bush, you know, the wolf in sheep's clothing.
[02:04:33.094 --> 02:04:35.559]  Everybody's just, sportsman for Bush, you know.
[02:04:36.562 --> 02:04:39.565]  Yeah, he'll ban our shotguns and register everything.
[02:04:39.945 --> 02:04:59.584]  It's so conservative, and try to block arming all the pilots, and he's roping borders, and he blocked Dan Burton's committee, and basically said the White House press secretary threatened members of the press not to ask about Dan Burton's committee and why the White House is blocking and protecting Clinton, and blah, blah, blah, and campaign finance reform, restricting the First Amendment, and
[02:05:00.304 --> 02:05:09.648]  On and on and on and on and on and on and on and Patriot Act 1 and 2 and Homeland Security and forced inoculations and FEMA camps.
[02:05:11.009 --> 02:05:11.229]  Yep.
[02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:12.589]  It goes on and on, doesn't it?
[02:05:12.609 --> 02:05:13.610]  Appreciate the call, Don.
[02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:14.070]  Alex.
[02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:14.790]  Yes, sir.
[02:05:15.010 --> 02:05:16.631]  I've been playing around with chat rooms.
[02:05:16.691 --> 02:05:21.313]  I just learned how to email and do chat rooms and stuff for the last month or so.
[02:05:21.713 --> 02:05:27.535]  And I've been pumping your websites, Prison Planet Infowars, and telling everybody about it.
[02:05:27.555 --> 02:05:29.456]  When you push the talk button on the
[02:05:30.552 --> 02:05:31.653]  And what would happen...
[02:05:44.182 --> 02:06:10.025]  Let's say there's 20 people in a room, and five of them went and did what you're doing, and then hundreds hear it, and then hundreds do it, and then thousands do it, and that's happening, and that's why InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are now getting tens of millions of hits a month, millions of individual visitors, and I'm just one gun, one emplacement, in the InfoWar, firing on the enemy.
[02:06:10.285 --> 02:06:11.486]  You can all be leaders.
[02:06:11.946 --> 02:06:14.468]  In the Info War, and if we don't do it, it's over.
[02:06:15.529 --> 02:06:17.291]  Did you get that FBI flyer I sent to you?
[02:06:18.712 --> 02:06:19.292]  Which one?
[02:06:19.672 --> 02:06:23.355]  Oh, the new one, not the old one from Maricopa Sheriff.
[02:06:23.396 --> 02:06:24.136]  No, I didn't get it.
[02:06:24.156 --> 02:06:24.977]  You need to send it again.
[02:06:24.997 --> 02:06:25.557]  I did.
[02:06:25.998 --> 02:06:26.718]  I sent it to you, man.
[02:06:26.738 --> 02:06:27.919]  You know, I try to read all the mail.
[02:06:27.959 --> 02:06:28.800]  Stuff slips past me.
[02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:29.521]  I apologize.
[02:06:29.541 --> 02:06:30.361]  When did you mail that?
[02:06:30.381 --> 02:06:31.602]  2001 South Tomorrow.
[02:06:31.802 --> 02:06:32.823]  Yeah, I'll send you another copy.
[02:06:33.003 --> 02:06:33.744]  When did you mail it?
[02:06:34.725 --> 02:06:35.946]  Oh, it had to be three weeks ago.
[02:06:37.347 --> 02:06:39.568]  Okay, that'll be in a box of mail that says that week.
[02:06:39.608 --> 02:06:41.589]  I mean, people, don't stop sending mail.
[02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:44.051]  Don't stop sending email, or I would never get anything.
[02:06:44.071 --> 02:06:44.491]  Yep.
[02:06:45.692 --> 02:06:49.134]  That's why I've been plugging my videos a little bit harder than usual.
[02:06:49.274 --> 02:06:51.795]  I've just signed a lease for a bigger office.
[02:06:51.815 --> 02:06:57.198]  Because my office, I broadcast out of my home, but I have an office that I go to to work.
[02:06:57.218 --> 02:07:03.302]  I mean, I can broadcast out of a corner room with the padded walls and the hookups, but I can't.
[02:07:03.939 --> 02:07:07.642]  I'm running my business out of the house, so I have an office, a little two-room office.
[02:07:07.662 --> 02:07:08.782]  I just had to get a bigger one.
[02:07:09.523 --> 02:07:16.308]  We have hundreds of doctors and lawyers and scientists and college students that want to intern for us.
[02:07:16.408 --> 02:07:17.729]  That takes infrastructure.
[02:07:17.749 --> 02:07:20.711]  So I'm getting a little bit bigger office.
[02:07:20.771 --> 02:07:21.892]  I may get an even bigger one.
[02:07:22.232 --> 02:07:24.914]  Then I could have people that would read all that, look at all that.
[02:07:26.635 --> 02:07:33.640]  I'm just trying to grow here, but it takes funds to do it, and that's why it's important for listeners to buy the videos and all that stuff.
[02:07:35.273 --> 02:07:36.214]  Thanks for the call, Don.
[02:07:37.295 --> 02:07:39.056]  Let's talk to Perry in Kansas.
[02:07:39.096 --> 02:07:39.937]  Perry, you're on the air.
[02:07:39.977 --> 02:07:40.397]  Go ahead.
[02:07:40.417 --> 02:07:50.405]  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you that they have these protests every week in Kansas City out there in the plaza downtown, and they got their little signs out there, Honk for Peace and everything.
[02:07:51.286 --> 02:07:58.512]  Well, it only took them until last week to finally put up a sign that said that Bush uses 9-11 to suit his purpose for anything that he does.
[02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:00.899]  I just can't believe it took them this long.
[02:08:01.079 --> 02:08:04.722]  And this in a city where I'm on an AM that covers the entire city.
[02:08:04.882 --> 02:08:09.185]  I just want to congratulate them for finally putting up a sign that says something about 9-11.
[02:08:10.165 --> 02:08:11.006]  That's all I had to say.
[02:08:11.066 --> 02:08:12.087]  It's been a long time.
[02:08:12.267 --> 02:08:12.867]  I've been waiting.
[02:08:13.808 --> 02:08:14.308]  Well, you got it.
[02:08:14.348 --> 02:08:16.970]  I mean, how many copies of my videos have been made in Kansas City?
[02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.790]  It's got to be 50,000.
[02:08:18.351 --> 02:08:23.054]  I've given them to the protesters out there and told them to watch them with their friends in their college dorms.
[02:08:25.769 --> 02:08:26.249]  Great job.
[02:08:26.289 --> 02:08:28.390]  And you see how the left-wingers are neutralized.
[02:08:28.430 --> 02:08:30.271]  They have mindless chants, they say.
[02:08:30.831 --> 02:08:32.872]  They say, oh, the UN's good, Bush is bad.
[02:08:32.932 --> 02:08:35.093]  No, they're all together in good cop, bad cop.
[02:08:35.613 --> 02:08:40.996]  And they don't understand that instead of being out there protesting, they should be at the county commissioners, city council meetings.
[02:08:41.376 --> 02:08:48.559]  They should be knocking on doors, running for political office, putting up websites, getting radio shows, calling into radio shows.
[02:08:49.099 --> 02:08:52.681]  Protesting is what you did 100 years ago when that was the medium.
[02:08:53.286 --> 02:08:55.288]  And they don't know what S-22 is.
[02:08:55.348 --> 02:08:59.331]  They don't know that what they're doing is going to become terrorism.
[02:09:01.192 --> 02:09:02.994]  Yeah, they got bills for life in prison.
[02:09:03.034 --> 02:09:05.596]  If one protester blocks traffic, everyone gets life in prison.
[02:09:05.636 --> 02:09:06.577]  I've read the bill on air.
[02:09:06.877 --> 02:09:08.238]  And they don't know anything about that.
[02:09:08.818 --> 02:09:09.839]  They don't know anything about it.
[02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:13.142]  Well, see, that's because the CFR member Moyers...
[02:09:14.486 --> 02:09:21.651]  As they announced Patriot Act 2, took it, watered it down, didn't tell you the really bad stuff, and told you it was secretly introduced in the House.
[02:09:21.711 --> 02:09:21.891]  No.
[02:09:22.412 --> 02:09:30.857]  Before Moyers even talked and wrote the story, you know, really got the story going, before he did that, it was introduced in the Senate under S-22.
[02:09:31.898 --> 02:09:33.820]  Justice Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:36.321]  In the House, it's Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[02:09:37.102 --> 02:09:42.926]  And Ashcroft on TV saying there's no Patriot Act 2 when the thing was introduced seven months ago.
[02:09:44.269 --> 02:09:46.471]  Just four days shy of seven months ago, my friend.
[02:09:48.813 --> 02:10:01.002]  Some guy called in yesterday and told you that you had homophobic overtones or undertones to your program, and it sounded like it kind of pissed you off, and I just wanted to let you know, don't let those people get you down for more than 30 seconds.
[02:10:02.983 --> 02:10:04.384]  Well, I appreciate the call, sir.
[02:10:04.725 --> 02:10:05.205]  Take care.
[02:10:05.986 --> 02:10:10.349]  Look, I don't get up here and bash people individually as human beings.
[02:10:11.644 --> 02:10:15.366]  But I do criticize behavior that destroys lives.
[02:10:16.787 --> 02:10:19.149]  And at the same time, many of these people are militant.
[02:10:19.949 --> 02:10:21.370]  They're behind the CPS.
[02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:24.973]  They're involved taking kids from families and then taking them for themselves.
[02:10:25.033 --> 02:10:25.733]  It's in the news.
[02:10:25.773 --> 02:10:26.293]  It's submitted.
[02:10:27.334 --> 02:10:33.678]  The people promoting UNESCO, Bush, and the rest of them, UNESCO says the family is a disease and will be destroyed.
[02:10:33.758 --> 02:10:35.479]  Now, I've read this on air.
[02:10:35.819 --> 02:10:36.980]  I've read the textbooks.
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:41.203]  I've posted official UN documents, their own manuals.
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:45.682]  For the United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization.
[02:10:48.064 --> 02:11:01.673]  In my book, Consent into Tyranny, I have Julian Huxley, the brother of Aldous Huxley, the guy that wrote Brave New World, where he says we're going to have euthanasia, we're going to condition people that euthanasia is good.
[02:11:01.893 --> 02:11:03.214]  This is a Nazi system.
[02:11:03.554 --> 02:11:04.495]  It's a culture of death.
[02:11:04.515 --> 02:11:05.796]  They don't want you having children.
[02:11:05.816 --> 02:11:07.157]  They don't want you having families.
[02:11:07.337 --> 02:11:08.838]  They don't want you being fulfilled.
[02:11:11.952 --> 02:11:15.715]  So if you're going to do what you're going to do, leave us alone.
[02:11:15.815 --> 02:11:17.215]  Stop teaching it in schools.
[02:11:17.796 --> 02:11:18.516]  Leave us alone.
[02:11:18.536 --> 02:11:19.437]  You know, they teach this stuff.
[02:11:19.657 --> 02:11:21.458]  When I was in high school, they were teaching it in schools.
[02:11:21.858 --> 02:11:26.502]  In the name of diversity and, you know, all these terms, they teach it.
[02:11:27.822 --> 02:11:28.923]  They shouldn't be teaching.
[02:11:29.163 --> 02:11:35.567]  I mean, imagine if the coaches said, I'm going to have a special class for the ten cheerleaders about heterosexual sex.
[02:11:35.587 --> 02:11:37.889]  We're going to describe all the forms of sex.
[02:11:38.797 --> 02:11:45.199]  We're going to bus the cheerleaders to a dormitory where they're going to lay in beds and discuss all this and maybe act it out.
[02:11:45.659 --> 02:11:49.160]  That's been in mainstream news in Massachusetts, Texas, other areas.
[02:11:49.380 --> 02:11:50.741]  They're recruiting in the schools.
[02:11:51.301 --> 02:11:52.401]  But it's not heterosexual.
[02:11:52.741 --> 02:11:53.781]  It's homosexual.
[02:11:54.021 --> 02:11:55.662]  And now you're not supposed to use the word homosexual.
[02:11:56.269 --> 02:12:07.039]  There was a BBC article, arrests were made, people gave speeches where they used the word homosexual, arrests were made, they said the word homosexual has aggressive overtones, you cannot use it.
[02:12:07.319 --> 02:12:09.721]  That was the head of Scotland Yard's diversity unit.
[02:12:11.783 --> 02:12:13.404]  The head of Scotland Yard's diversity unit.
[02:12:13.725 --> 02:12:15.126]  Don't use the scientific term.
[02:12:15.666 --> 02:12:17.448]  It's like, say, don't say Caucasian.
[02:12:18.402 --> 02:12:19.483]  Don't say Negro.
[02:12:19.763 --> 02:12:20.824]  What is Negro now?
[02:12:20.984 --> 02:12:21.484]  Evil word?
[02:12:21.524 --> 02:12:21.824]  Yes.
[02:12:22.305 --> 02:12:23.766]  They're saying that in some quarters.
[02:12:24.186 --> 02:12:25.687]  It's the scientific term.
[02:12:26.067 --> 02:12:27.088]  Like Caucasian.
[02:12:27.468 --> 02:12:28.209]  Or Asian.
[02:12:29.950 --> 02:12:30.830]  Or you're Asian.
[02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:31.671]  I mean, it's nuts.
[02:12:31.751 --> 02:12:37.895]  You can't even, in England, you can't even say homosexual or risk arrest by Scotland Yard when it's a scientific term.
[02:12:38.135 --> 02:12:39.736]  I mean, how far is this going?
[02:12:40.036 --> 02:12:41.037]  How far is this going to happen?
[02:12:41.077 --> 02:12:45.380]  It's political correctness run completely out of control.
[02:12:47.182 --> 02:12:48.203]  Come back and take more calls.
[02:12:48.223 --> 02:12:49.964]  We've got Mike Hanson coming up.
[02:12:50.925 --> 02:12:55.488]  He stopped robbers who robbed 20 buildings and cars that night.
[02:12:56.269 --> 02:12:57.390]  He stopped them at gunpoint.
[02:12:57.410 --> 02:12:58.610]  The police came and thanked him.
[02:12:58.671 --> 02:12:59.992]  Good job, Travis County.
[02:13:00.412 --> 02:13:04.014]  Do more of that instead of SWAT team raids on old ladies, and we'll thank you on this show.
[02:13:05.916 --> 02:13:06.937]  That's coming up in 10 minutes.
[02:13:06.957 --> 02:13:07.937]  I've got a bunch of other news.
[02:13:07.977 --> 02:13:09.058]  Yes, I haven't gotten to it.
[02:13:09.078 --> 02:13:09.819]  It's all coming up.
[02:13:09.879 --> 02:13:10.639]  I'm fired up.
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:12.701]  I had a Starbucks coffee this morning.
[02:13:15.157 --> 02:13:19.059]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:13:19.299 --> 02:13:24.722]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:13:25.003 --> 02:13:35.368]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:13:35.528 --> 02:13:39.871]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:13:40.071 --> 02:13:43.773]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine
[02:13:43.973 --> 02:13:48.476]  Benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:13:48.696 --> 02:13:55.080]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:13:55.180 --> 02:13:59.663]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[02:15:14.625 --> 02:15:19.530]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a roadmap and how easy it would be to get lost?
[02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:21.211]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[02:15:21.231 --> 02:15:23.573]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.

[02:16:15.538 --> 02:16:21.284]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:16:21.544 --> 02:16:26.669]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:16:27.010 --> 02:16:36.299]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[02:17:22.032 --> 02:17:24.334]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:17:29.798 --> 02:17:32.159]  All right, let's jam three calls into this segment.
[02:17:32.179 --> 02:17:34.221]  Then I'm going to come back with Mike Hanson for about five minutes.
[02:17:34.261 --> 02:17:35.041]  His voice is shoddy.
[02:17:35.061 --> 02:17:45.467]  He's been on so many radio shows talking about how these thugs, and of course it turned out there were weapons in their vehicles, I'm being told, had broken into his fireworks stand.
[02:17:46.288 --> 02:17:48.069]  You know, evil fireworks that Mike sells.
[02:17:48.669 --> 02:17:49.630]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:17:49.650 --> 02:17:51.911]  They're trying to ban them here in Texas.
[02:17:52.051 --> 02:17:54.513]  Mike came out in his underwear at gunpoint out of his mobile trailer.
[02:17:55.507 --> 02:18:03.010]  And stopped them, and the police actually came and thanked Mike because the guys had robbed 20 people that night and were just full of loot.
[02:18:03.991 --> 02:18:04.691]  So that's coming up.
[02:18:05.091 --> 02:18:08.292]  Right now, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[02:18:08.993 --> 02:18:12.074]  Let's talk to Bill in Wisconsin and Alan in Illinois and others.
[02:18:12.114 --> 02:18:12.854]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:18:13.695 --> 02:18:15.936]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:18:16.576 --> 02:18:23.779]  I wanted to tell you over the weekend I had a phone call from the Republican Congressional Committee
[02:18:25.121 --> 02:18:35.687]  And, you know, they play a tape by Congressman Tom DeLay, and then they get one of their party members on there to try to get money out of you.
[02:18:36.128 --> 02:18:37.528]  Help us stop the liberals.
[02:18:37.568 --> 02:18:39.029]  Help us defend the Second Amendment.
[02:18:39.209 --> 02:18:40.450]  Right, right.
[02:18:40.670 --> 02:18:45.613]  And what do I think of George Bush and what he's doing?
[02:18:45.773 --> 02:18:51.897]  So automatically I said I have no intention of voting for George Bush.
[02:18:52.057 --> 02:18:54.018]  I said he is as bad as Clinton.
[02:18:54.648 --> 02:18:58.290]  And I went into the Clinton connection with MENA.
[02:18:59.070 --> 02:19:00.071]  I went into 9-11.
[02:19:00.351 --> 02:19:03.713]  Well, blocking Dan Burton's committee.
[02:19:03.793 --> 02:19:05.914]  Protecting Bill Clinton aggressively.
[02:19:06.234 --> 02:19:07.015]  That also.
[02:19:07.375 --> 02:19:13.958]  Then I went into Congressman Tom Tancredo, Congressman Ron Paul on the Patriot Act.
[02:19:13.998 --> 02:19:16.680]  And for those that don't know, Tancredo, Paul, and others...
[02:19:17.469 --> 02:19:22.952]  Including Senator Smith, have all been targeted by the White House for defeat in elections publicly.
[02:19:23.232 --> 02:19:24.933]  That's your conservatism, folks.
[02:19:25.113 --> 02:19:25.934]  Right, right.
[02:19:26.514 --> 02:19:27.355]  But you know what?
[02:19:27.515 --> 02:19:29.376]  She could have pulled the plug right away.
[02:19:29.656 --> 02:19:34.879]  She wasn't your usual equal opportunity person that they had called in.
[02:19:35.079 --> 02:19:38.281]  Probably some volunteer who's dedicating her time to she cares.
[02:19:38.301 --> 02:19:41.243]  Right, and I gave her your website twice.
[02:19:42.003 --> 02:19:45.105]  I said, tonight, when you're on your knees saying your prayers...
[02:19:45.683 --> 02:19:49.246]  Say prayers for our country because we're going into a police state.
[02:19:50.146 --> 02:19:51.847]  And I went on for about 10 or 15 minutes.
[02:19:55.195 --> 02:20:01.438]  What do you think of DARPA admitting that this giant grid face scanners are to be used by the government, the military, the police?
[02:20:01.778 --> 02:20:03.639]  It is a taxation slave grid.
[02:20:04.019 --> 02:20:09.721]  They're now throwing at your face that, yeah, all these microphones and cameras, DARPA put them in five years ago.
[02:20:09.781 --> 02:20:11.022]  It is for you and your family.
[02:20:11.362 --> 02:20:12.783]  No Fourth Amendment, no nothing.
[02:20:12.823 --> 02:20:15.744]  I mean, this is so bad, it's worse than Russia.
[02:20:16.323 --> 02:20:16.603]  Yeah.
[02:20:17.104 --> 02:20:21.786]  Then I said to her, if we're under attack, I said, what's the first thing a country does?
[02:20:21.907 --> 02:20:22.827]  Controls their borders.
[02:20:23.047 --> 02:20:23.988]  Controls their borders.
[02:20:24.148 --> 02:20:25.229]  And she didn't know that.
[02:20:25.329 --> 02:20:30.932]  And, you know, I used it as an educational opportunity, and who knows what she did.
[02:20:32.193 --> 02:20:38.417]  She could be the person who influences somebody, who brings out the key corruption that brings them down.
[02:20:38.977 --> 02:20:43.340]  I felt that at the end of it, she was ready to, you know, quit her job.
[02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:44.300]  Good.
[02:20:44.601 --> 02:20:45.241]  You know, honestly.
[02:20:47.387 --> 02:20:51.571]  All but evil men and tyrancy to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[02:20:51.991 --> 02:20:52.692]  One other thing.
[02:20:52.752 --> 02:20:54.714]  The guy that says we ought to go to Target.
[02:20:55.254 --> 02:21:03.222]  Target is owned by Dayton Department Stores, and the owner of Dayton is in the United States Senate.
[02:21:04.071 --> 02:21:07.072]  And he's one of the most liberal that's in there.
[02:21:07.432 --> 02:21:09.032]  He gives money to gun grabbers.
[02:21:09.232 --> 02:21:10.793]  He's involved in RFIDs.
[02:21:11.213 --> 02:21:12.673]  But see, this is the problem.
[02:21:13.793 --> 02:21:19.314]  Once they unify corruption, then once they put it in everywhere, you can't boycott because you don't have a choice.
[02:21:19.654 --> 02:21:20.835]  And we're nearing that point.
[02:21:21.015 --> 02:21:30.977]  That's why I said that we had to boycott Smith & Wesson when they tried to do a backroom deal to sell out gun dealers and make them waive their rights and ban low-capacity mags, everything.
[02:21:31.477 --> 02:21:34.919]  I said, we've got to stop them now or everybody will be squeezed and follow suit.
[02:21:35.399 --> 02:21:36.980]  And the Justice Department said that.
[02:21:37.461 --> 02:21:38.761]  That was what the deal was about.
[02:21:39.582 --> 02:21:41.183]  So it's key fights.
[02:21:41.223 --> 02:21:42.683]  We've got to boycott Walmart.
[02:21:43.284 --> 02:21:44.965]  Folks, I wanted to go to Walmart the other day.
[02:21:45.005 --> 02:21:46.726]  It's the only thing 24 hours around me.
[02:21:47.646 --> 02:21:48.507]  I needed something.
[02:21:49.087 --> 02:21:50.088]  I just went without.
[02:21:50.968 --> 02:21:52.849]  I will not go to Walmart.
[02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:54.750]  Do not do it, folks.
[02:21:55.231 --> 02:21:59.493]  Yeah, go to some of these, like Ace Hardware.
[02:22:00.154 --> 02:22:01.375]  They are locally owned.
[02:22:01.395 --> 02:22:05.718]  Well, I buy a lot of sporting goods because I fish some and do stuff like that in spare time, which is about once a month.
[02:22:06.578 --> 02:22:07.919]  And, you know, I don't go to Walmart.
[02:22:07.999 --> 02:22:11.162]  I go to Academy, which is a locally, you know, owned deal.
[02:22:11.202 --> 02:22:12.442]  Got everything Walmart's got.
[02:22:12.683 --> 02:22:12.943]  Right, right.
[02:22:12.963 --> 02:22:16.345]  Maybe 10 cents more because they don't have all the slave camps.
[02:22:16.605 --> 02:22:17.826]  Right, right.
[02:22:18.487 --> 02:22:19.527]  All right, thanks for the call, bud.
[02:22:19.567 --> 02:22:20.308]  Hey, you bet.
[02:22:20.588 --> 02:22:21.248]  I appreciate it.
[02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.789]  You bet.
[02:22:22.529 --> 02:22:24.110]  Now, Walmart is pure evil, people.
[02:22:26.354 --> 02:22:28.296]  You know, I've been caught sneaking in there.
[02:22:28.316 --> 02:22:29.437]  I feel like a Baptist.
[02:22:29.637 --> 02:22:30.838]  I haven't done this in a while.
[02:22:30.878 --> 02:22:31.519]  I won't do it again.
[02:22:31.539 --> 02:22:35.722]  Maybe once or twice a year I get caught sneaking into Walmart late at night when I have to.
[02:22:35.742 --> 02:22:37.524]  People, Alex Jones, you're here too?
[02:22:37.564 --> 02:22:38.404]  You say don't come here.
[02:22:38.424 --> 02:22:43.589]  I'm like a Baptist caught running out of the liquor store with a fifth of Jack Daniels.
[02:22:45.117 --> 02:22:48.138]  You know, in Texas, that's why they put it in a paper bag.
[02:22:48.298 --> 02:22:49.419]  I don't drink.
[02:22:49.479 --> 02:22:50.239]  I'm just giving you an example.
[02:22:50.259 --> 02:22:51.240]  Well, I drink beer every once in a while.
[02:22:51.260 --> 02:22:57.462]  But the point I'm making is just that's why in Texas they put the paper bag over it so you don't get caught.
[02:22:57.482 --> 02:23:02.064]  But it's like, I feel like a Baptist sneaking into Walmart, you know, sneaking into the liquor store.
[02:23:05.226 --> 02:23:06.126]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.606 --> 02:23:08.227]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.148 --> 02:23:11.829]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.077 --> 02:23:18.460]  Pharmaceutical companies, doctors, and hospitals all make money from sick people.
[02:23:18.700 --> 02:23:20.741]  So what incentive is there for them to make you well?
[02:23:21.062 --> 02:23:25.865]  For thousands of years, man has used spices and herbs to ward off disease and cure, yes, your... 888-803-4438.
[02:23:25.885 --> 02:23:26.886]  Call now and get free shipping.
[02:23:26.906 --> 02:23:27.166]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:23:54.634 --> 02:23:56.695]  We're good to go.
[02:23:57.355 --> 02:24:00.776]  We're good to go.
[02:24:24.958 --> 02:24:25.959]  I had Mike Hansen on.
[02:24:25.999 --> 02:24:27.400]  He's done a lot of camera work for me.
[02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:29.101]  He snuck into Bohemian Grove with me.
[02:24:29.121 --> 02:24:32.524]  The only person other than myself to ever get in and get out with footage.
[02:24:32.544 --> 02:24:36.007]  Of course, we both had hidden cameras.
[02:24:37.908 --> 02:24:45.674]  Mike has gone to urban warfare training operations with me where the Marines are publicly training to put you and your family in camps with foreign troops.
[02:24:46.134 --> 02:24:48.636]  The role players are screaming, I'm an American, no, not the camp.
[02:24:49.497 --> 02:24:53.440]  And Mike has helped run one of my TV shows for several years.
[02:24:55.413 --> 02:24:59.817]  And he's running a firework stand in South Austin to raise money to run for political office.
[02:24:59.837 --> 02:25:03.280]  He got a record number of votes running for county commissioner, but lost.
[02:25:04.642 --> 02:25:09.126]  Now he's, because it's a Democrat area, he ran as a Republican but got record votes.
[02:25:09.526 --> 02:25:12.108]  Now he's running as a Democrat because it doesn't matter, he's a patriot.
[02:25:12.709 --> 02:25:13.690]  Or a constable.
[02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:17.333]  I want a better place, giving him a better place for Mike than as a constable.
[02:25:18.014 --> 02:25:21.657]  Because he's against the police state, but he's also against criminals of any type.
[02:25:22.466 --> 02:25:26.148]  His brother's a police officer as well, a veteran police officer here on the force for the great record.
[02:25:26.809 --> 02:25:32.252]  And Mike is asleep in a lone camper next to the firework stand.
[02:25:33.393 --> 02:25:35.655]  And we told the story of the guys breaking in.
[02:25:35.695 --> 02:25:38.176]  Mike comes out, holds him at gunpoint in his underwear.
[02:25:38.236 --> 02:25:41.058]  He's got him by the side of the highway asking for help.
[02:25:41.118 --> 02:25:41.979]  Nobody will stop.
[02:25:42.639 --> 02:25:45.121]  Finally, somebody calls the police.
[02:25:46.068 --> 02:25:54.910]  And they come, and Mike was surprised because we read all the news articles where they arrest people for defending their family, even in their own homes, but that's in New York and Massachusetts.
[02:25:55.250 --> 02:25:57.071]  But now it's even happening in places like Alabama.
[02:25:57.091 --> 02:25:57.991]  It's getting weirder and weirder.
[02:25:58.691 --> 02:26:06.553]  But now Mike said that he just got a visit from the Travis County Sheriff's Department thanking him because this solved 20 robberies.
[02:26:07.553 --> 02:26:10.274]  So Mike, give us a recap of something good the police did.
[02:26:10.294 --> 02:26:12.254]  We want to commend them when they do something good.
[02:26:12.974 --> 02:26:15.195]  Mike's voice is shot from telling this story on
[02:26:15.882 --> 02:26:16.643]  We're good to go.
[02:26:43.392 --> 02:26:46.294]  I never spend enough time on this, but here's a case right here in Austin.
[02:26:46.894 --> 02:26:50.075]  Mike, recapping the story and then what the police said when they came out.
[02:26:51.796 --> 02:26:52.797]  Good to have you on the show, Mike.
[02:26:52.817 --> 02:26:55.918]  Well, from your radio show, Alex, that's why my voice is shot.
[02:26:56.939 --> 02:27:06.943]  But Monday morning, I was asleep at 4.30 in the morning, and we did have another woman and a man sleeping on the property, too, in their van.
[02:27:08.863 --> 02:27:11.465]  And I heard something over the baby monitor that we used.
[02:27:12.146 --> 02:27:13.787]  This is a big factory outlet here.
[02:27:14.308 --> 02:27:15.549]  It's about 100-foot.
[02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:18.571]  It's not an average fireworks stand.
[02:27:18.611 --> 02:27:19.512]  It's a huge one.
[02:27:19.872 --> 02:27:21.994]  You've been here, Alex.
[02:27:22.434 --> 02:27:27.638]  We have over $50,000 worth of stuff here now ready to sell it for the 4th of July.
[02:27:27.658 --> 02:27:30.561]  So it's a huge operation out here.
[02:27:30.661 --> 02:27:35.705]  And we usually have like 20 to 40 volunteers a night, but they all leave like at midnight.
[02:27:36.255 --> 02:27:36.836]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:27:54.269 --> 02:27:54.489]  Okay, so...
[02:28:25.106 --> 02:28:26.249]  So what happens next?
[02:28:26.790 --> 02:28:32.644]  Well, the RV is sitting where I can see the front of the...
[02:28:36.292 --> 02:28:36.832]  I think so.
[02:29:00.658 --> 02:29:08.299]  When I got a little bit farther, I seen that they were loading as much stuff as they could, and I'm not talking about just little pink firecrackers.
[02:29:08.339 --> 02:29:15.381]  They were loading the $100 items, big tube, professional-type things in the coffin.
[02:29:16.341 --> 02:29:24.142]  And so when I saw that, I ran up to the fence, and I took the safety off and put my finger on the trigger, and I said, you better get on the ground.
[02:29:24.182 --> 02:29:28.463]  I said a few other choice words, and they did get on the ground.
[02:29:29.048 --> 02:29:29.128]  Yeah.
[02:29:59.905 --> 02:30:01.807]  I think so.
[02:30:19.911 --> 02:30:23.454]  They got the police calling and they stopped pointing the gun at me.
[02:30:23.514 --> 02:30:25.776]  I said, I'm going to point this gun until the sheriff gets here.
[02:30:25.796 --> 02:30:27.177]  I can guarantee you that.
[02:30:27.517 --> 02:30:28.478]  Mike, are you there?
[02:30:28.518 --> 02:30:28.778]  Yeah.
[02:30:29.178 --> 02:30:31.300]  We've gone over that, and so the police came.
[02:30:31.340 --> 02:30:32.321]  They said good job.
[02:30:32.681 --> 02:30:35.043]  You were surprised by that because we've seen the other activities.
[02:30:35.103 --> 02:30:46.073]  This same sheriff's department raids whole neighborhoods with the Army and then says we don't need warrants, but that's the sheriff giving these orders as part of the multi-jurisdictional task force.
[02:30:46.693 --> 02:30:47.454]  But the reason I...
[02:30:48.300 --> 02:31:01.965]  I had you back on the show because you got a visit from the Travis County Sheriff's Department saying good job, and we want to commend them for encouraging citizens to defend their life, liberty, and property.
[02:31:02.445 --> 02:31:05.586]  And you did a great job, so tell us what happened.
[02:31:06.266 --> 02:31:09.327]  You said about eight different police cars showed up that night.
[02:31:09.387 --> 02:31:16.610]  They said good job, but now... Well, it took them until 8 o'clock in the morning to inventory all the stuff they had in that...
[02:31:17.839 --> 02:31:19.140]  We're good to go.
[02:31:44.514 --> 02:31:48.715]  And he got out of his car, so I went and met him, and I shook his hand and said, I'm Mike Hanson.
[02:31:48.775 --> 02:31:58.438]  And he says, yeah, I came out here to shake your hand and tell you thank you so much that they had robbed 20 people that night, and they're going to be able to solve the case.
[02:31:58.699 --> 02:32:05.021]  And he wanted to follow up on everything, and so I was just real proud about that.
[02:32:05.041 --> 02:32:07.721]  And they need to get about 10, 15 years in prison.
[02:32:08.142 --> 02:32:09.202]  The problem is...
[02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:16.321]  That some little pothead with a bag of weed is going to get five years hard labor, and these guys will probably get a month in the county jail.
[02:32:17.382 --> 02:32:22.423]  Well, you know, we all have liberty until you violate somebody's property or their person.
[02:32:22.443 --> 02:32:23.383]  That's the way I believe.
[02:32:24.283 --> 02:32:25.103]  Well, absolutely so.
[02:32:25.123 --> 02:32:31.945]  I'll defend everybody's Bill of Rights as the next constable, but if you violate somebody or somebody's property, I think that's wrong.
[02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:38.892]  Well, it certainly isn't what the government was supposed to do before, serve the people, and it's been warped and deformed.
[02:32:39.653 --> 02:32:41.293]  But it's the citizen that stops crime.
[02:32:41.313 --> 02:32:45.215]  The police will tell you this more often, about five times more often than police do.
[02:32:46.213 --> 02:32:52.795]  And the highest crime rates are areas where they've disarmed the people, like New York, like Chicago, like Los Angeles.
[02:32:53.515 --> 02:33:02.098]  And I just want to just add you back up, because he came out and thanked you, and he was also probably making sure you testify in court, correct?
[02:33:02.298 --> 02:33:13.921]  Well, I think it's because of shows like yours airing here in Austin and the AXS TV that you do here in Austin, because I had a meeting with the assistant police chief,
[02:33:14.501 --> 02:33:22.707]  And I told him that these black ski masks that we have on tape, you know, we went down there and got on tape, and no name tags are not going to do it.
[02:33:23.027 --> 02:33:29.872]  I mean, we have got to have our police where we can identify them and we need to turn them back into peace officers.
[02:33:29.973 --> 02:33:31.173]  Or their secret police.
[02:33:31.233 --> 02:33:38.739]  And he told me, Mike, I promise you that there's going to be no more black ski masks and everybody will have name tags.
[02:33:38.759 --> 02:33:41.441]  So I think it does make a difference when you speak out, Alex.
[02:33:42.324 --> 02:33:42.924]  We're good to go.
[02:33:42.944 --> 02:33:43.884]  We're good to go.
[02:34:02.390 --> 02:34:04.392]  I agree with you.
[02:34:21.829 --> 02:34:23.010]  Well, we need to do more of that.
[02:34:23.170 --> 02:34:25.391]  And, Mike, I'm glad that everything went well.
[02:34:25.491 --> 02:34:34.297]  And good cops like my brother, Bill Hanson, here in Austin, when they report cops, they get transferred out.
[02:34:34.477 --> 02:34:37.119]  Instead of the bad cop getting in trouble, they transfer him.
[02:34:37.139 --> 02:34:41.342]  He's been in that area for eight years in a good area, and they transfer him to a bad area.
[02:34:41.622 --> 02:34:44.524]  That's the punishment you get if you complain about a bad cop.
[02:34:46.685 --> 02:34:49.607]  Yeah, sweeping corruption under the rug only makes it fester.
[02:34:51.539 --> 02:34:54.081]  Well, I sure appreciate everything you do, Alex.
[02:34:54.401 --> 02:34:55.942]  Well, I appreciate you coming on, Mike.
[02:34:56.042 --> 02:34:56.642]  One last question.
[02:34:56.662 --> 02:34:58.343]  I'm going to go to these calls and cover final news.
[02:34:59.224 --> 02:35:00.544]  One last question for you, Mike.
[02:35:01.485 --> 02:35:06.568]  The sheriff's deputy that came out, thank you, he said they robbed 20 people that night?
[02:35:07.048 --> 02:35:07.589]  That's right.
[02:35:08.129 --> 02:35:12.131]  And probably, you know, if they'd been doing it all that night, you can imagine.
[02:35:12.412 --> 02:35:14.553]  This was like a gang of thugs.
[02:35:14.693 --> 02:35:16.074]  So if they had been doing...
[02:35:16.674 --> 02:35:32.158]  That night, you can sure that they had been... As a matter of fact, one of the victims called me this morning, too, and said that he saw the video on TV of the person that did it, and that was the one that he saw that broke into his truck.
[02:35:32.791 --> 02:35:37.334]  Now, how did... You know, even the victims are recognizing this gang of thugs.
[02:35:37.514 --> 02:35:44.138]  Mike, I know we have video of this, and I know we've aired it on some of our shows, but I'm trying to understand here.
[02:35:44.158 --> 02:35:46.920]  I haven't seen all the video.
[02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:48.901]  I've been watching the shows, haven't had time.
[02:35:48.941 --> 02:35:51.643]  You say that you've got video of these guys' faces or the news?
[02:35:51.663 --> 02:35:52.684]  Oh, yeah, I've got video...
[02:35:53.811 --> 02:35:58.715]  Jimmy Ritter came out within 10 minutes and started getting video of all of the stuff.
[02:35:58.815 --> 02:36:01.057]  They had all the stereos and camcorders.
[02:36:01.157 --> 02:36:02.238]  One guy's a white guy.
[02:36:02.598 --> 02:36:02.979]  Hold on.
[02:36:03.199 --> 02:36:04.120]  One guy's a white guy.
[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:05.241]  The other guy's Hispanic.
[02:36:05.521 --> 02:36:06.942]  What color's the guy that got away?
[02:36:06.962 --> 02:36:12.686]  I have no idea because when I marched him back, I figured out now when I marched him back to the...
[02:36:13.667 --> 02:36:16.188]  I'm trying to get to this point.
[02:36:16.528 --> 02:36:19.369]  I'm trying to find out who the other guy is so they can catch him.
[02:36:19.389 --> 02:36:19.869]  Hey, listen, Mike.
[02:36:19.889 --> 02:36:20.970]  I'm sure they're going to catch him.
[02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:29.853]  The man that came out, the sheriff that came out yesterday said that they're almost sure that they're going to be able to get him because the other ones are going to tell off on him.
[02:36:43.015 --> 02:36:43.255]  All right.
[02:36:43.295 --> 02:36:43.796]  Thanks, Mike.
[02:36:44.216 --> 02:36:44.757]  God bless you.
[02:36:45.177 --> 02:36:45.558]  You bet.
[02:36:46.298 --> 02:36:53.065]  And, folks, somebody robbing video cameras and firework stands and cars is bad enough.
[02:36:53.125 --> 02:36:59.271]  But, I mean, we have a government that runs the stock exchange and the Chicago mercantile, and it's a giant scam.
[02:36:59.331 --> 02:37:03.636]  The speculation, the currency speculation, it's all a giant scam.
[02:37:03.696 --> 02:37:04.797]  It's totally staged.
[02:37:05.849 --> 02:37:08.031]  And, you know, that's the real crimes.
[02:37:08.251 --> 02:37:09.591]  You want to know what the real crimes are?
[02:37:10.252 --> 02:37:22.019]  And, you know, the Second Amendment is to defend against the common street thug that Mike was defending against and against organized crime in government, the most dangerous type because of the size and scope and the mechanized fashion.
[02:37:22.853 --> 02:37:26.176]  And I'm going to go to Al in Illinois here in a second, but let me cover this now.
[02:37:26.196 --> 02:37:27.938]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[02:37:27.978 --> 02:37:30.741]  This is the big crime, the stuff that we need to be aware of.
[02:37:31.421 --> 02:37:34.324]  UN ship carried child prostitutes.
[02:37:34.944 --> 02:37:35.765]  That's the headline.
[02:37:36.346 --> 02:37:44.954]  The United Nations is investigating a report that a ship chartered for peacekeepers in East Timor is being used to bring child prostitutes to the island nation.
[02:37:44.994 --> 02:37:47.356]  The organization said today the allegations surfaced.
[02:37:48.837 --> 02:37:58.484]  Over the weekend, in the Portuguese weekly Espresso, the Espresso reports of the UN personnel were involved in bringing girls from Thailand to East Timor as prostitutes.
[02:37:59.445 --> 02:38:02.187]  So far, some of the allegations are unsubstantiated.
[02:38:02.247 --> 02:38:05.409]  Yeah, right, said Hun Zhang, UN Deputy Spokesman.
[02:38:06.690 --> 02:38:15.517]  She said the... would not elaborate or comment further on the status of the investigation being conducted by the UN's Office of Internal Oversight.
[02:38:16.098 --> 02:38:24.160]  The same office investigated allegations last year of sexual exploitation of refugee children in West Africa by employees of more than 40 private organizations.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:31.502]  The report found that allegations largely unsubstantiated, although they were raised in a report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
[02:38:32.002 --> 02:38:33.882]  Folks, the UN shot video of what they do.
[02:38:34.762 --> 02:38:45.665]  The UN just got caught in civil court, had to admit to it with DynCorp, kidnapping 200,000 women and children out of Eastern Europe and shipping them to Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other areas of Asia.
[02:38:47.361 --> 02:38:49.403]  That's Washington Post, AP Reuters.
[02:38:49.483 --> 02:38:51.825]  But back in the newspaper, only hear about it once or twice.
[02:38:52.966 --> 02:38:53.867]  So that's going on.
[02:38:53.987 --> 02:38:56.029]  Also, woman sacked for revealing U.N.
[02:38:56.069 --> 02:38:57.570]  links with sex trade.
[02:38:58.691 --> 02:39:03.355]  London Times, how a tribunal vindicated an investigator who blew the whistle on workers in Bosnia.
[02:39:04.469 --> 02:39:09.094]  A damning dossier sent to Catherine Bolvak to her employees detailing U.N.
[02:39:09.134 --> 02:39:14.058]  workers' involvement in the sex trade in Bosnia cost the American her job with the internal police force.
[02:39:14.559 --> 02:39:16.241]  She was sacked after disclosing that U.N.
[02:39:16.261 --> 02:39:22.206]  peacekeepers went to nightclubs where girls as young as 15 were forced to dance naked and have sex with customers and that U.N.
[02:39:22.226 --> 02:39:25.670]  personnel and international aid workers were linked to prostitution rings in the Balkans.
[02:39:28.141 --> 02:39:31.463]  After a two-year battle, an employment tribunal ruled yesterday that Ms.
[02:39:31.883 --> 02:39:42.550]  Balkovic was unfairly dismissed by DynCorp, and America companies who branch in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England, dealt with the contacts of American officers working for the International Police Force in Bosnia.
[02:39:43.248 --> 02:39:48.852]  And the article goes on to say it was involved in the transfer of 200,000 women and children out of country.
[02:39:48.892 --> 02:39:58.139]  See how they give you the first report, oh, going to nightclubs with child prostitutes and slave prostitutes, and then later, oh, and 200,000 of them were kidnapped.
[02:39:58.859 --> 02:39:59.399]  Here's another one.
[02:39:59.479 --> 02:40:02.081]  UN troops accused of systematic rape in Sierra Leone.
[02:40:02.802 --> 02:40:08.746]  Rebel government troops and United Nations peacekeepers were all guilty of raping women on a systematic scale throughout Sierra Leone's brutal civil war.
[02:40:08.766 --> 02:40:12.749]  A leading international human rights group reported yesterday, and it goes into all the documents.
[02:40:13.450 --> 02:40:14.251]  Human Rights Watch.
[02:40:15.431 --> 02:40:17.072]  Let's go to Al in Illinois.
[02:40:17.212 --> 02:40:18.553]  Al, thanks for holding it on the air.
[02:40:18.573 --> 02:40:19.954]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:40:20.034 --> 02:40:22.276]  I'd like to thank you for your services.
[02:40:22.896 --> 02:40:26.498]  And I had something to say about, I read the Michael Moore book.
[02:40:26.558 --> 02:40:27.219]  I didn't buy it.
[02:40:27.259 --> 02:40:29.280]  I would never buy his book, his e-book.
[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:34.363]  And page 120 and 121, he has a, you know, he's pro-UN.
[02:40:34.443 --> 02:40:36.325]  He likes the sex trades and all that.
[02:40:37.225 --> 02:40:38.546]  Well, in it, quote,
[02:40:39.150 --> 02:40:43.872]  Now the new Russian leaders talk about building more weapons and selling arms to Iran and North Korea.
[02:40:45.253 --> 02:40:51.916]  We had missed the chance of a lifetime to end an insane arms race and create a new ally in this new world order.
[02:40:52.857 --> 02:40:54.097]  He's just another sheep.
[02:40:54.117 --> 02:40:55.138]  He's just another sheep.
[02:40:55.538 --> 02:40:56.519]  I can't stand this guy.
[02:40:56.539 --> 02:40:59.080]  I don't know why he comes on all these CFR propaganda.
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:00.200]  Well, he's not a sheep.
[02:41:00.340 --> 02:41:03.682]  He's a shepherd.
[02:41:03.722 --> 02:41:04.362]  He's a wolf.
[02:41:04.402 --> 02:41:05.343]  He's a Judas goat.
[02:41:06.170 --> 02:41:08.291]  And he controls the left-right paradigm.
[02:41:08.311 --> 02:41:15.235]  See, the left is controlled, the right is controlled by the neocons, and they're all going in the same direction, just different rhetoric.
[02:41:15.755 --> 02:41:16.816]  Oh, yeah, I totally agree.
[02:41:16.876 --> 02:41:17.436]  Absolutely.
[02:41:17.496 --> 02:41:19.057]  The left-right paradigm.
[02:41:19.097 --> 02:41:19.817]  It's a bunch of junk.
[02:41:19.877 --> 02:41:22.759]  Do you want to hold over and add some more points, or are you done?
[02:41:23.859 --> 02:41:24.660]  Sure, I'd add a few.
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:25.660]  Okay, stay there.
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:26.861]  I don't want to give you just a minute.
[02:41:27.421 --> 02:41:28.121]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:28.181 --> 02:41:28.722]  Final segment.
[02:41:28.742 --> 02:41:31.183]  I'll hit a few final news tidbits, recap some stuff.
[02:41:31.703 --> 02:41:32.924]  And, yes, I'll plug my videos.
[02:41:32.944 --> 02:41:34.745]  If you want to support the show, get some powerful films.
[02:41:35.797 --> 02:41:40.160]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:40.341 --> 02:41:44.764]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:44.904 --> 02:41:49.288]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:49.348 --> 02:41:50.669]  The New World Order.
[02:41:52.450 --> 02:41:56.692]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:56.752 --> 02:42:03.676]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:03.796 --> 02:42:05.797]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:06.457 --> 02:42:11.461]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:44:40.643 --> 02:44:42.545]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:44:43.025 --> 02:44:45.867]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:50.871 --> 02:44:54.654]  By the way, it's a live Wednesday edition of the World Wide Broadcast.
[02:44:54.694 --> 02:44:58.877]  I'll be doing a fourth hour right when this show ends.
[02:45:00.138 --> 02:45:08.565]  I'm going to be sitting in for Michael Trudeau and the owner and founder of Genesis Communications, Ted Anderson, is going to be sitting in with me.
[02:45:09.138 --> 02:45:20.588]  We're going to be talking about DARPA and how they now admit that the cameras, the face-scanning cameras, the stuff that scans your license plates is all really a Defense Department operation to track and trace and control the American people.
[02:45:21.749 --> 02:45:32.738]  And we're going to be giving that out free for anybody that doesn't have a computer and who wants a copy of the 40-page, I don't know, roughly 40-page document from DARPA.
[02:45:33.982 --> 02:45:39.665]  As well as the AP article, because a listener was earlier talking about what they can do and how they wanted to get this and give it to people.
[02:45:40.425 --> 02:45:42.146]  And some people don't have computers.
[02:45:42.226 --> 02:45:46.728]  Well, if you want it, you can call the network, and we'll give you the number in the next hour and tell you how to do that.
[02:45:46.748 --> 02:45:54.051]  But for stations who carry this show, I appreciate them, and all our listeners and affiliates and sponsors and everybody, I really appreciate you.
[02:45:54.311 --> 02:45:56.071]  I've got some final news I'm about to hit right now.
[02:45:56.111 --> 02:45:57.692]  Let's go back to Al in Illinois.
[02:45:57.712 --> 02:45:59.473]  Al, go ahead and finish up your points.
[02:46:00.069 --> 02:46:03.810]  Well, I was going to talk about Liberia and our role in peacekeeping.
[02:46:04.650 --> 02:46:06.411]  I don't think we should be going to Liberia.
[02:46:06.611 --> 02:46:13.413]  I think, well, George Bush made a quote about peacekeeping in a video in 1991.
[02:46:13.773 --> 02:46:15.613]  Do you mind if I play the sound clip?
[02:46:15.653 --> 02:46:16.614]  It's like 30 seconds.
[02:46:17.794 --> 02:46:19.114]  There's no profanity, is there?
[02:46:19.274 --> 02:46:20.015]  No, none whatsoever.
[02:46:20.035 --> 02:46:21.175]  Now go ahead and play it.
[02:46:23.436 --> 02:46:24.176]  This is George Sr.
[02:46:25.307 --> 02:46:32.393]  Have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order.
[02:46:33.154 --> 02:46:39.019]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nation.
[02:46:40.380 --> 02:46:43.142]  We are successful, and we will be.
[02:46:43.883 --> 02:46:46.165]  We have a real chance at this new world order.
[02:46:47.126 --> 02:46:58.688]  What do you think about that?
[02:46:58.888 --> 02:47:12.511]  Well, it is law of the jungle, where you've got America being used as the muscle for the UN and its global empire, and then the UN plays the part of the good cop and says they're against all this, while using America as the muscle, and we take all the blame.
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:13.620]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:13.660 --> 02:47:14.581]  We're playing the bad cop.
[02:47:14.981 --> 02:47:17.401]  And look at what the UN's been caught doing all over the place.
[02:47:18.342 --> 02:47:19.322]  Yeah, it's a joke.
[02:47:20.202 --> 02:47:28.005]  It's very, very serious because they're setting this up here and they plan to break off the Southwest and have a big war and implode the economy.
[02:47:28.025 --> 02:47:35.588]  They've got a lot of different irons in the fire, a lot of different scams they can pull, but we've got to stand up and let them know we know that they're behind it.
[02:47:35.708 --> 02:47:36.988]  That can back them down.
[02:47:37.788 --> 02:47:38.369]  Yes, I am.
[02:47:38.569 --> 02:47:41.750]  I'm behind you and Mike and everybody, all the listeners.
[02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:42.070]  I've been...
[02:47:42.577 --> 02:47:54.180]  Distributing the videos, and I think I've woken probably 30 or 40 people up, and I don't know, it's getting sickening, and I'm just going to fight it the way I can do it, and I appreciate you letting me into the call.
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:54.580]  God bless you.
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:55.641]  Al, appreciate the call.
[02:47:55.721 --> 02:47:57.421]  We're out of time for this hour.
[02:47:57.701 --> 02:48:00.782]  Also next hour, I will cover global war, pop U.S.
[02:48:00.822 --> 02:48:07.784]  officials discuss expanding terror war in Iran, and beyond when I fill in for Michael Trudeau on the Midas Report.
[02:48:08.675 --> 02:48:09.876]  Normally a financial news hour.
[02:48:09.896 --> 02:48:13.579]  We'll have some of that for you, but mainly news and information in the next hour.
[02:48:13.599 --> 02:48:16.781]  Then I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:48:17.421 --> 02:48:20.664]  And the Midas Report on Global Shortwave is on 12-160.
[02:48:21.284 --> 02:48:25.427]  My show is Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 on 12.172 and 93.20 and from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[02:48:32.358 --> 02:48:39.660]  If you want my videos, go to InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net to order them or call toll-free.
[02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:42.380]  Get involved in the fight, just like Al's done.
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:43.280]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:48:43.860 --> 02:48:48.501]  Get Police State 3.

[02:48:56.823 --> 02:49:01.985]  Don't sit idly by and let these monsters take over.
[02:49:02.005 --> 02:49:03.126]  888-253-3139.
[02:49:03.366 --> 02:49:12.850]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:49:14.430 --> 02:49:15.871]  We will be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:15.891 --> 02:49:16.811]  I'll be back in the next hour.
[02:49:17.811 --> 02:49:20.092]  Everybody out there, God bless you all.
[02:49:20.713 --> 02:49:24.274]  Recognize evil for what it is and stand up and fight it and be part of history.
[02:49:25.982 --> 02:49:32.189]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:49:32.890 --> 02:49:36.694]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most...
