[00:00:03.951 --> 00:00:07.194]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:15.443]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:17.145]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:19.027]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.047 --> 00:00:20.468]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:21.950]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:26.689]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.031]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:41.555]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:45.536]  It's already Thursday, the 4th of September.
[00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:49.669]  2003.
[00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:49.669]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:59.833]  Coming up in the third hour, we've got Jack McClam, Police Against the New World Order, to talk about some of the tactics we can use using the truth to wake up police and the military.
[00:00:59.853 --> 00:01:01.734]  So that's coming up the third hour.
[00:01:01.754 --> 00:01:12.218]  In the meantime, I'm going to cover news and have open phones so you can have a chance to get on air and talk about the news items that you think are important or any questions or comments that you may have.
[00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:16.986]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:22.829]  Colin Powell has now said they have a resolution.
[00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.830]  They want to report to the U.N.
[00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.850]  They want the U.N.
[00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.253]  to be the boss in Iraq with Russian troops on the ground.
[00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:35.258]  Now, day one I told everybody this was going to happen.
[00:01:35.298 --> 00:01:35.898]  The U.N.
[00:01:35.938 --> 00:01:38.379]  was going to come in, was going to take the country over.
[00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.141]  The globalists always say what they're going to do beforehand.
[00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:46.384]  They said, up front, this was the official policy, after, quote, stabilization.
[00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:53.869]  Now it's this theatrical situation where they tell the world, oh, America couldn't get the job done.
[00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:55.210]  Now the U.N.
[00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.112]  that was against the war the whole time has to come in and save us.
[00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:03.142]  So it's more elaborate propaganda.
[00:02:03.162 --> 00:02:03.862]  We'll get into that.
[00:02:03.982 --> 00:02:04.682]  Also, U.S.
[00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:08.144]  recruiting former Saddam agents to battle old boss.
[00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:08.804]  Now, wait a minute.
[00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:10.965]  I thought that Saddam was dead.
[00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:12.805]  And his sons were dead.
[00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:14.306]  And Chemical Ali was dead.
[00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:22.769]  But now they tell us that, well, they're alive and Chemical Ali's been captured and the Saddam's sons have been killed three separate times.
[00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:31.872]  And they'll be back in a few months saying Saddam's sons are back attacking and Kemal Ali is back attacking or died in a bombing attack or they captured him.
[00:02:33.273 --> 00:02:35.353]  We're entering a literal false reality.
[00:02:36.374 --> 00:02:41.976]  Also more is coming out on touch screen voting being a fraud with the CIA and the federal government involved running it.
[00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:43.977]  Actual documents now coming out.
[00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:48.438]  People have gotten into meetings and caught all this is in the mainstream news.
[00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.280]  But again in just a few regional papers not making national news.
[00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:56.863]  I already mentioned this, but Russia may send troops to Iraq.
[00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:58.303]  London on high terror alert.
[00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:00.964]  The police chief says we're going to put troops on the streets.
[00:03:01.044 --> 00:03:02.104]  That equals safety.
[00:03:02.484 --> 00:03:04.064]  No, that equals martial law.
[00:03:04.144 --> 00:03:05.825]  But the border's wide open to the country.
[00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:07.205]  Illegals pour in.
[00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:19.668]  We have now posted the analysis I did of Arnold Schwarzenegger that goes over all the sordid details and background and the Illuminati backing that this sinister character has.
[00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:35.232]  So you'll definitely want to go to Infowars.com right now and download this article, read it for yourself, check out the hyperlinks that document what we're claiming, and then email it out to your friends and family, especially if they live on the West Coast or California.
[00:03:35.852 --> 00:03:38.552]  Because the story in and of itself is a diversion.
[00:03:39.153 --> 00:03:42.453]  Bustamante, Davis, Schwarzenegger, they're all the same on policies.
[00:03:42.813 --> 00:03:44.894]  But the background of this recall
[00:03:45.544 --> 00:03:58.232]  Those that are backing Schwarzenegger, how he can have these big government socialistic views of abortion, open borders, gun control, and be hailed by the Limbaugh's and Hannity's of the world.
[00:03:58.252 --> 00:04:01.053]  This article is very important.
[00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:03.134]  I hope everybody will go to InfoWars.com.
[00:04:03.174 --> 00:04:07.497]  It's also posted on PrisonPlanet.com and download it, email it out to everybody in your circle.
[00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:15.068]  Because people need to know the truth and need to understand what's behind this giant diversion that's taking place.
[00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:20.610]  So again, go to Infowars.com and get this lengthy article that we've written that's very detailed.
[00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.552]  We went to a lot of trouble to write this, so I hope that you'll definitely go get it and get it out to everybody in your area.
[00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:29.074]  Also, it turns out they've got surveillance devices.
[00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:33.264]  Uh, in Dealey Plaza to listen to what people are saying on the streets.
[00:04:33.284 --> 00:04:37.648]  Of course, they're already doing that in most major cities, so we were already aware of it, but we'll get to that.
[00:04:38.108 --> 00:04:40.811]  More on Patriot Act 2 and Victory Act 2.
[00:04:41.932 --> 00:04:43.293]  It's metastasizing.
[00:04:43.993 --> 00:04:44.514]  Again, U.S.
[00:04:44.574 --> 00:04:45.615]  offers a report to the U.N.
[00:04:45.655 --> 00:04:46.135]  on Iraq.
[00:04:46.155 --> 00:04:46.836]  More on that.
[00:04:48.177 --> 00:04:49.558]  Abortion doctor is killer.
[00:04:49.658 --> 00:04:52.861]  Executed in Florida last night, or early this morning.
[00:04:54.423 --> 00:04:56.825]  California governor slams actor for no show.
[00:04:57.865 --> 00:05:01.486]  Fox News, Gaines, other news networks.
[00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:06.648]  Paul, again, big show lined up for you, and open phones, and a great guest.
[00:05:06.668 --> 00:05:07.328]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.531]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:14.691 --> 00:05:19.113]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:19.273 --> 00:05:23.654]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:23.694 --> 00:05:25.015]  The New World Order.
[00:05:26.817 --> 00:05:31.039]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:38.041]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:40.162]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:45.226]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new 2.5 hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!
[00:05:57.038 --> 00:06:00.442]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.462 --> 00:06:00.782]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.822 --> 00:06:02.083]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:06:02.163 --> 00:06:02.784]  Commodities.
[00:06:02.804 --> 00:06:03.044]  Futures.
[00:06:03.064 --> 00:06:03.285]  Options.
[00:06:13.214 --> 00:06:18.579]  While most people are acquainted with stocks and mutual funds, the commodities markets remain a mystery.
[00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.281]  It's one Barclay Financial can help solve.
[00:06:21.802 --> 00:06:26.686]  Futures and options investing involves substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.
[00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:29.649]  I'm Patrick T. Parker for Barclay Financial.
[00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.131]  Right now, the U.S.
[00:06:31.231 --> 00:06:35.775]  trade deficit and budget deficits are rising to historical levels.
[00:06:36.275 --> 00:06:41.257]  Interest rates are at some of the lowest levels we have ever seen, and yet the economy is still weak.
[00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:44.057]  And we feel this could spell trouble for the dollar.
[00:06:44.377 --> 00:06:47.598]  To Barclay Financial, that spells opportunity.
[00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:50.159]  The European currency has been on the rise.
[00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:56.421]  We feel it will keep on rising, and as a result, we're recommending the purchase of call options on the euro currency.
[00:06:56.741 --> 00:07:00.664]  For a free special market report on the euro currency, call 1-800-348-4100.
[00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:05.468]  That's 1-800-348-4100.
[00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:07.309]  Barclay Financial.
[00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.111]  Mystery solved.
[00:07:09.611 --> 00:07:10.132]  Hello, folks.
[00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:13.094]  Alex Jones here, introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:07:13.354 --> 00:07:16.817]  They're new, and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:20.878]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:07:21.098 --> 00:07:27.260]  Black Merti Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:35.582]  The Trihalomethanes volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Styrene, Chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:07:36.002 --> 00:07:41.347]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[00:07:41.507 --> 00:07:45.270]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:47.492]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:49.734]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:07:49.974 --> 00:07:55.219]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:07:55.259 --> 00:08:00.503]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:08:03.886 --> 00:08:07.727]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:17.429]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:21.089]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.811]  It's happened over and over again throughout history.
[00:08:31.272 --> 00:08:38.616]  Powerful people get into positions of authority and they seek to expand and maintain that power.
[00:08:39.296 --> 00:08:47.040]  They seek to overthrow any free population, to destroy any middle class that is not dependent on them.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:56.825]  They seek to create a massive underclass and a tiny elite of bureaucrats and their military police enforcers.
[00:08:57.978 --> 00:09:06.842]  The exact same pattern, in the exact same order, textbook fashion is now unfolding worldwide.
[00:09:08.263 --> 00:09:15.326]  Command and control thugs, fascist communists killed over 200 million people last century alone.
[00:09:16.527 --> 00:09:25.611]  And the sinister bankers that controlled and created the dictators of the last century are in control now.
[00:09:26.485 --> 00:09:35.874]  And are shutting up a whole new ball game where the numbers of dead and dying will dwarf those of the 20th century.
[00:09:38.118 --> 00:09:39.399]  Now that's the historical facts.
[00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:41.020]  You can hope it's going to go away.
[00:09:41.961 --> 00:09:45.804]  You can tune into your lying neocons that tell you gun control is conservative.
[00:09:46.805 --> 00:10:00.335]  You can watch as you lose your property rights and as dozens of new giant federal agencies and state agencies are created, as they take your right to vote away with touchscreen systems run by the CIA publicly.
[00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:06.480]  You can sit there as we lose everything and are delivered into
[00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:08.539]  Total bondage!
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:17.387]  Or you can get involved and become leaders and support this broadcast and support others that are telling the truth and that are involved in the fight for the Republic.
[00:10:19.248 --> 00:10:20.009]  It's that simple.
[00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.092]  And we're going to have open phones today.
[00:10:23.132 --> 00:10:26.835]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:26.975 --> 00:10:30.078]  I don't have a guest in the first or second hour.
[00:10:30.138 --> 00:10:32.219]  We have Jack McClam, Police Against the New World Order.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.922]  Police and Military Against the New World Order in the third hour.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:45.668]  I've got a detailed analysis that I've written of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and it's very important that everyone read it, even if you don't live in California.
[00:10:45.968 --> 00:10:59.222]  It's a case point example of the Kingmakers and the New World Order, and how if someone has their blessing, it doesn't matter how much dirt they've got in their background, they're anointed to dominate societies.
[00:11:00.865 --> 00:11:22.036]  I would ask that all the listeners that are on the computer get that story, read it, and email it, and print it out, and pass it on to folks so that we can expose this model neocon who is for total amnesty, open borders, abortion on demand, homosexuals adopting children, and I mentioned massive gun control, and I rarely watch TV.
[00:11:22.076 --> 00:11:25.858]  Every time I turn the TV on, Fox News is praising Arnold at nauseam.
[00:11:26.835 --> 00:11:33.137]  You flip over to Fox Television and it's the most degenerate, family-destroying trash of any network.
[00:11:33.577 --> 00:11:35.318]  This is the neoconservatism.
[00:11:36.938 --> 00:11:40.059]  This is the group that votes with Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton.
[00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:44.360]  This is the group that has different rhetoric, but the actions are the same.
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:54.023]  This is the most dangerous force we're facing in the country right now because they have beguiled and snowed millions of good conservatives and Christians.
[00:11:54.563 --> 00:11:56.504]  Your Christian leaders are selling you out.
[00:11:57.379 --> 00:11:58.980]  They've been paid off by the Feds.
[00:11:59.901 --> 00:12:02.383]  I mean, we're in a serious situation.
[00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:08.327]  And right now, the phony neocon-conservatism is being exposed to the left wing.
[00:12:08.587 --> 00:12:12.430]  The left wing, the socialists, the communists are being energized.
[00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:18.735]  The Greens are being energized for a false counter-revolution to sweep into office in the near future.
[00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:21.637]  And then we're even going to go further downhill.
[00:12:25.976 --> 00:12:26.617]  Lord help us.
[00:12:26.657 --> 00:12:31.661]  I mean, I pray every night that God move to open the minds and hearts of men and women everywhere in this country.
[00:12:33.202 --> 00:12:35.944]  I've also got an editorial out of Casper, Wyoming.
[00:12:35.984 --> 00:12:38.286]  I want to read about Patriot Act and Victory Act.
[00:12:38.627 --> 00:12:39.327]  It's excellent.
[00:12:40.688 --> 00:12:44.672]  Just a bunch of different articles, but I said we go to calls early in the show, so let's do it.
[00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:46.133]  Eric in Texas.
[00:12:46.153 --> 00:12:46.473]  Go ahead.
[00:12:46.493 --> 00:12:47.134]  You're on the air.
[00:12:47.874 --> 00:12:48.355]  Hey, Alex.
[00:12:48.615 --> 00:12:52.178]  I just wanted to call in and I just love everything you're doing.
[00:12:52.625 --> 00:12:58.829]  There's so many angles to exposing people to the info war that's out there.
[00:12:58.849 --> 00:13:05.374]  And I just, I found one that besides your tapes has been really tremendous and kind of exposing this sort of thing.
[00:13:05.414 --> 00:13:07.396]  And that is, there's a comedy.
[00:13:07.416 --> 00:13:10.838]  It's about 59 minutes long on the internet.
[00:13:11.078 --> 00:13:12.499]  You may or may not have heard of it.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.762]  It's called Between Iraq and a Hard Place.
[00:13:16.222 --> 00:13:19.004]  And it's by this, these two folks, Rimmer and Berg.
[00:13:19.801 --> 00:13:23.664]  Over in England, it's kind of a Saturday Night Live kind of skit.
[00:13:24.364 --> 00:13:25.565]  It's in four parts.
[00:13:26.726 --> 00:13:34.131]  It's based on historical facts and exposes the absurdity through comedy of the actions of our world leaders.
[00:13:35.051 --> 00:13:37.693]  And I was wanting to know if you were familiar with that.
[00:13:39.054 --> 00:13:39.835]  No, I'm not.
[00:13:40.175 --> 00:13:43.017]  I am not familiar with that.
[00:13:43.577 --> 00:13:44.598]  If you just type in
[00:13:45.427 --> 00:13:49.148]  Between Iraq and a Hard Place, do a search.
[00:13:49.988 --> 00:13:51.089]  You can go to that site.
[00:13:51.589 --> 00:13:56.511]  And this came out of Christmas of last year, actually, before we went into Iraq.
[00:13:57.291 --> 00:14:06.694]  And it's an English comedy, and they go through the history of the British Empire in that Mesopotamia area and so forth.
[00:14:06.834 --> 00:14:10.535]  And it's just 59 minutes, I think, or 49 minutes.
[00:14:10.715 --> 00:14:12.196]  Wonderful comedy.
[00:14:12.276 --> 00:14:13.196]  Very bright.
[00:14:14.116 --> 00:14:35.150]  Very well thought out, and it just, along with your pace and news and Deception Dollar, I think this is a unique angle in that it's comedy, and I've sat down with friends and we eat popcorn and just watch it live right there streaming off the internet, and it's got a conversion rate sort of like what your pace does.
[00:14:36.112 --> 00:14:45.625]  And by conversion rate, we're talking about 80, 90 plus percent of people waking up when they see Road to Tyranny or this particular play that you're talking about.
[00:14:46.106 --> 00:14:49.811]  The danger there, and I haven't seen this play is, again,
[00:14:51.028 --> 00:15:00.982]  Under Clinton, the neocons were able to build up great credibility because they were legitimately exposing Clinton for traitorous, larcenous activities.
[00:15:01.062 --> 00:15:04.207]  But again, they didn't mention that Bill Clinton was just a puppet of the globalists.
[00:15:04.247 --> 00:15:07.672]  It was all, oh, all this bad stuff's happening because of Bill Clinton.
[00:15:08.212 --> 00:15:10.755]  If we just had a good Republican in, this wouldn't be happening.
[00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:12.858]  The same thing's happening under Bush.
[00:15:12.918 --> 00:15:26.293]  The Democrats can rightfully point out all this incredible corruption, all these horrible things, act like it's Bush and the crime family that's running all this when they're just high-level puppets as well, and then that lends legitimacy and energizes the false left wing.
[00:15:26.893 --> 00:15:28.494]  Right, and that's the danger.
[00:15:28.755 --> 00:15:43.285]  Yeah, so we've got to show people how the Republican and Democrats on open borders, gun control, sellouts of secrets to foreign countries, pardoning of traitors, campaign finance reform, on all these key issues of not arming the pilots, it goes on and on, are all on the same page.
[00:15:44.006 --> 00:15:50.330]  And then we've got to look at the so-called neocon purveyors of information, what hypocrites they are, how they're only about labels.
[00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.272]  And the best example is Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:15:53.030 --> 00:16:05.227]  Anti-gun, anti-family, open border, all this stuff, and with a horrible, sordid sexual background that makes Bill Clinton look tame, and that's okay.
[00:16:05.267 --> 00:16:05.768]  I've seen them.
[00:16:05.908 --> 00:16:06.929]  Oh, big deal.
[00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.433]  You know, I'm sick of these right-wingers.
[00:16:10.514 --> 00:16:12.815]  Oh, the hammers in the classrooms are good.
[00:16:13.115 --> 00:16:14.655]  The leftists are against them, you know.
[00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:16.395]  Oh, the leftists are against cameras.
[00:16:16.455 --> 00:16:17.456]  No, the leftists put them in.
[00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:21.196]  The leftists are just, again, one arm on this beast system.
[00:16:21.276 --> 00:16:24.817]  And I totally am excited about what you're saying, Eric, and I want to check it out.
[00:16:25.097 --> 00:16:29.998]  What do you think about the announcements of how they won a national draft and how they're getting ready to start it for professionals?
[00:16:30.799 --> 00:16:37.200]  I think it's absurd, and I think that the information war is just the name of your
[00:16:38.118 --> 00:16:40.883]  It's wonderful because it is an information war.
[00:16:40.903 --> 00:16:50.179]  I've been handing out the 17 listed things of the philosophy of the neocons on Ron Paul's site, which you had a link on Infowars.
[00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:59.494]  Two different people at the university here and so forth, and just trying to expose at least the neocon agenda.
[00:16:59.514 --> 00:17:01.655]  You have to get a foot in the door with people.
[00:17:01.695 --> 00:17:11.100]  But I would say to these left-wingers when they're going, yeah, the neocons are bad, yeah, they're the ultimate evil, yeah, they planned 9-1-1, yeah, look, they bragged in PNAC documents, look, we've got a confession here.
[00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:15.703]  Explain to them, wait a minute, let's read their stated goals.
[00:17:15.883 --> 00:17:17.784]  Bigger government, welfare state,
[00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:23.474]  A police state, loss of liberty, but wait... No second amendment.
[00:17:23.554 --> 00:17:26.376]  Well, explain to the left people, go, wait a minute, exactly.
[00:17:27.036 --> 00:17:37.163]  Well, wait, they're actually for what the Democratic Party are for, and then they'll go, cannot compute, cannot compute, cannot compute, and at that point, a lot of them will break their conditioning and see the bigger paradigm.
[00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:43.427]  Exactly, and you may not, you may get that cannot compute for the first day, but hopefully that rings a bell in their mind.
[00:17:43.447 --> 00:17:44.788]  Well, here's another cannot compute.
[00:17:44.848 --> 00:17:46.730]  They all know depleted uranium is bad,
[00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:51.037]  And it's 1,900 times higher than its safe level in Baghdad right now.
[00:17:51.057 --> 00:17:54.464]  But they're for pushing their man, no matter what, until we get them off of that.
[00:17:54.644 --> 00:17:55.185]  Exactly.
[00:17:55.245 --> 00:17:59.914]  So the left can see that, but they go, wait a minute, Bill Clinton used depleted uranium in Serbia.
[00:18:01.138 --> 00:18:02.359]  See, that's another sick argument.
[00:18:02.399 --> 00:18:05.300]  The Democrats will go, well, the Republicans did it, well, the Democrats did it.
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.021]  Yeah, they're all on the same team.
[00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:12.844]  We've got to, you know, understand there's no separation here between these parties.
[00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:13.765]  Thanks for the call, Eric.
[00:18:14.245 --> 00:18:18.247]  And I know I beat that horse every day when I start this show, every night when I start this show.
[00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:20.788]  Because everything hinges on that.
[00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:22.569]  Paul in Tennessee.
[00:18:22.609 --> 00:18:23.169]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:18:23.189 --> 00:18:25.951]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:18:26.711 --> 00:18:29.853]  I was watching the Today Show yesterday, and after watching
[00:18:31.013 --> 00:18:39.359]  A clip on that show of Rush Lindbergh, Limbaugh, wanting Justice Moore to resign in protest.
[00:18:39.459 --> 00:18:46.105]  And then they had an interview with Moore where the interviewer was saying, well, if things don't work out, are you going to resign?
[00:18:46.165 --> 00:18:47.225]  So they all want him to resign.
[00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:50.928]  But then the next story was... Now, wait a minute.
[00:18:50.988 --> 00:18:52.469]  Limbaugh wants him to resign?
[00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:53.170]  Oh, yes.
[00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:59.615]  But it said in the film clip, it said, surprisingly, Limbaugh is saying such and such, which is no surprise to me.
[00:19:01.365 --> 00:19:03.988]  I mean, the guy's published by the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:19:04.609 --> 00:19:06.531]  So if you believe in a New World Order, you're a kook.
[00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:07.412]  It doesn't exist.
[00:19:07.913 --> 00:19:11.577]  Well, he flips around, flip-flops, whatever's convenient or useful.
[00:19:13.299 --> 00:19:14.581]  That defends Arnold.
[00:19:15.892 --> 00:19:19.253]  Well, he wants to resign in protest.
[00:19:21.813 --> 00:19:24.794]  And if he does resign, then of course, their worries are over.
[00:19:25.574 --> 00:19:29.995]  And that sounds good, like, oh, he's for him!
[00:19:30.255 --> 00:19:32.035]  But that's exactly what the Democrats want.
[00:19:32.635 --> 00:19:40.157]  Right, but the next story they had on was a conspiracy fact, must be catching on, because they trotted out Daryl Posner,
[00:19:42.446 --> 00:19:50.673]  Who has written a new book and gives the secrets of 9-1-1, which supposedly the NSA and CIA are against him.
[00:19:50.733 --> 00:19:55.497]  Yeah, oh, they're against him, but oh, they didn't do anything wrong.
[00:19:55.537 --> 00:19:57.038]  Oh, that's the big secret we found out.
[00:19:57.458 --> 00:19:57.859]  Stay there.
[00:19:57.899 --> 00:19:58.720]  I'll let you finish up.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.041]  Paul will go to others.

[00:23:09.463 --> 00:23:15.746]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[00:23:16.126 --> 00:23:20.208]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[00:23:20.728 --> 00:23:27.931]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[00:23:28.471 --> 00:23:35.814]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[00:23:36.174 --> 00:23:38.415]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[00:23:38.735 --> 00:23:41.997]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[00:23:42.397 --> 00:23:45.558]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.

[00:24:25.009 --> 00:24:27.631]  By the way, I haven't really been promoting this like I should.
[00:24:27.751 --> 00:24:37.658]  Coming up September 11th, I'm going to be in Houston, Texas live at the Alamo Drafthouse Movie Theater at the West Oaks Shopping Center.
[00:24:38.139 --> 00:24:40.100]  It's a new movie theater.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.341]  Quite nice, I'm told.
[00:24:42.102 --> 00:24:45.204]  They've got several of the Alamo Drafthouse theaters here in Austin.
[00:24:45.564 --> 00:24:48.967]  We've shown Road to Tyranny, The Packed Houses twice before.
[00:24:49.787 --> 00:24:51.629]  So I'm going to do the live radio show.
[00:24:52.911 --> 00:25:01.198]  The live daytime show on September 11th, on that Thursday, I'm going to get in the truck, the evil SUV, and I'm going to drive to Houston.
[00:25:01.218 --> 00:25:16.230]  I'm going to give a speech for 30 minutes at 7 o'clock, and then I'm going to show Road to Tyranny, and then a double feature, THX 1138, the George Lucas film, with Robert Duvall about dehumanization and the lone individual standing up against it.
[00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.892]  It's kind of a Brave New World slash 1984 mixture redo.
[00:25:22.623 --> 00:25:24.326]  So you'll definitely want to see that.
[00:25:24.767 --> 00:25:26.791]  And that's September 11th, Houston, Texas.
[00:25:26.851 --> 00:25:27.593]  Come all.
[00:25:28.013 --> 00:25:29.777]  We'll love to see you out there, folks.
[00:25:30.298 --> 00:25:32.061]  Seven bucks to see both films, by the way.
[00:25:32.922 --> 00:25:34.345]  So that's oninfowars.com.
[00:25:35.982 --> 00:25:37.142]  Let's go back to Paul.
[00:25:37.562 --> 00:25:39.563]  Paul in Tennessee, then Fred, James, and others.
[00:25:40.723 --> 00:25:43.444]  Paul, I'm just predicting from what you said, because I know the tactic.
[00:25:43.544 --> 00:25:55.067]  When something becomes so mainstream, when they have to admit it and stop denying it, they will go, okay, the president lied, the document's out, this new book is a bombshell, it exposes what really happened on 9-1-1,
[00:25:56.371 --> 00:25:57.432]  Here's the big secret.
[00:25:57.472 --> 00:26:00.494]  The government were a bunch of idiots, and they messed up.
[00:26:00.794 --> 00:26:08.239]  Everybody goes, oh, this is incredible, and the person that wrote it is in a lot of trouble, and now we find out the secret truth.
[00:26:08.419 --> 00:26:09.099]  Is that what happened?
[00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:09.419]  Exactly.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.280]  Exactly.
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:10.800]  Exactly.
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:15.223]  See, you didn't even tell me, and I just couldn't, because they have certain tactics.
[00:26:16.224 --> 00:26:18.065]  Describe what you saw in the morning news.
[00:26:20.009 --> 00:26:20.990]  Oh, what do you mean?
[00:26:21.971 --> 00:26:25.333]  I mean, I just guessed what it was, but... Oh, okay, no, you're right.
[00:26:25.553 --> 00:26:34.541]  Well, Katie Couric came on and stated that this new book alleges that officials, some officials, in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan knew about the attacks before they took place.
[00:26:35.161 --> 00:26:43.508]  And all of this information is coming from our interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, who's the number three man in al-Qaeda, and
[00:26:44.321 --> 00:26:45.462]  We're good to go.
[00:27:02.017 --> 00:27:02.938]  Yeah, he's Chief Whitewasher.
[00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.651]  Uh, he said, here's another quote, he said,
[00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:59.712]  And Saudi Arabia paid for the FBI to pay for the hijackers' houses and cars and credit cards.
[00:28:00.052 --> 00:28:01.572]  No, they didn't.
[00:28:01.632 --> 00:28:05.653]  They're just pimps, minions in this, and this is sick.
[00:28:05.913 --> 00:28:12.555]  Well, he didn't mention President Bush's connections with the Bin Laden family.
[00:28:12.575 --> 00:28:18.136]  No, that only exists in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the BBC, not in a world of this great whitewasher.
[00:28:19.255 --> 00:28:19.535]  Right.
[00:28:20.316 --> 00:28:25.160]  They said in the book, which I recommend no one buys, Why America Slept.
[00:28:26.081 --> 00:28:31.966]  Oh yes, America Slept, but now, you know, the Bush administration, they're going to take your rights because they're good.
[00:28:31.986 --> 00:28:34.668]  This is the big secret scoop.
[00:28:35.009 --> 00:28:35.449]  Definitely.
[00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.392]  It isn't, but they're throwing it out.
[00:28:38.712 --> 00:28:39.973]  I mean, that's my point.
[00:28:39.993 --> 00:28:41.835]  They'll go, alright, you caught us.
[00:28:42.755 --> 00:28:44.157]  Here's the secret document.
[00:28:44.197 --> 00:28:45.498]  We didn't do anything wrong.
[00:28:45.638 --> 00:28:46.839]  Man, we've been caught.
[00:28:48.072 --> 00:28:48.853]  Man, you're slick.
[00:28:48.873 --> 00:28:54.316]  Well, it's like, you know, the thirty-something pages, twenty-seven pages out of the Saudi Arabia file.
[00:28:54.597 --> 00:28:59.420]  And they dribble that out and it's, the government didn't do anything wrong and Saudi Arabia could have done more.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.701]  Man, that's damaging.
[00:29:01.361 --> 00:29:04.884]  And then we ignore all the just blatant, incredible stuff.
[00:29:05.524 --> 00:29:07.866]  Well, he's definitely trying to muddy the waters.
[00:29:08.626 --> 00:29:09.527]  Well, it's not going to work.
[00:29:10.339 --> 00:29:10.619]  Right.
[00:29:10.699 --> 00:29:15.183]  I mean, they can have Ashcroft on a round-the-country tour saying the Patriot Act's good for you.
[00:29:15.524 --> 00:29:18.807]  More people are reading it and finding out that it's a lie.
[00:29:19.587 --> 00:29:22.650]  You know, they can claim all day, well, we've got to take your rights away for safety.
[00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.572]  People go, why is the border wide open?
[00:29:24.832 --> 00:29:26.654]  People aren't as stupid as they think.
[00:29:27.815 --> 00:29:28.355]  Definitely.
[00:29:28.495 --> 00:29:29.316]  Thank God for them.
[00:29:29.696 --> 00:29:30.017]  All right.
[00:29:30.057 --> 00:29:30.577]  Thank you.
[00:29:30.757 --> 00:29:31.498]  Thank you for the call.
[00:29:32.398 --> 00:29:33.779]  We'll come back and go to Fred and James.
[00:29:33.799 --> 00:29:34.860]  Then I'm going to shift into some news.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.120]  We'll go back into more calls.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.423]  Wide open phones today, tonight, this morning, depending on what time zone you're listening to us.
[00:29:40.623 --> 00:29:41.204]  We're live.
[00:29:41.224 --> 00:29:43.785]  It's the 4th of September, 2003.
[00:29:45.947 --> 00:29:46.687]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:46.707 --> 00:29:51.650]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, and InfoWars.com.
[00:29:52.171 --> 00:29:59.015]  I've got the new, in-depth, big picture, Dirt on Arnie at InfoWars.com, the story I wrote.
[00:30:00.558 --> 00:30:03.548]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.492 --> 00:30:07.181]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.646 --> 00:30:11.807]  Ask yourself these questions.
[00:30:11.927 --> 00:30:13.608]  Do you miss out on time with your loved ones?
[00:30:13.809 --> 00:30:14.989]  Are you making what you're worth?
[00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.712]  Are you wasting your life building someone else's fortune?
[00:30:17.932 --> 00:30:19.053]  Why not build your own?
[00:30:19.333 --> 00:30:21.675]  Imagine working your own hours building your own.
[00:30:21.715 --> 00:30:25.457]  Learn and teach others how to say no when asked for a social security number.
[00:30:25.477 --> 00:30:26.538]  Visit Nonumber.com or call 1-800-831-6141.
[00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:27.379]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:30:27.399 --> 00:30:28.680]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:46.668]  All right, we're now 33 minutes into the show.
[00:30:46.688 --> 00:30:49.171]  We've got about two hours and 26 minutes left.
[00:30:49.672 --> 00:30:57.342]  A toll-free number to join us on air on any issue you'd like to discuss, any news item, any socialist or neocon you'd like to expose.
[00:30:58.115 --> 00:31:01.218]  Any particular newscast you'd like to talk about?
[00:31:01.278 --> 00:31:04.341]  Any propaganda you've seen in your children's cartoons or at the movies?
[00:31:04.682 --> 00:31:05.943]  We talk about it all here.
[00:31:06.003 --> 00:31:14.512]  It's about becoming aware of our environment and what's going on around us in human history and trying to stand up for liberty and freedom and human decency.
[00:31:14.832 --> 00:31:20.338]  Coming up here in just a few minutes, we'll go to Fred and James and John and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:31:21.534 --> 00:31:23.975]  Also, I haven't spent enough time on regulating vitamins.
[00:31:24.295 --> 00:31:26.256]  There's a move in Europe to outright ban them.
[00:31:26.276 --> 00:31:28.156]  In fact, they've already done that in most European countries.
[00:31:28.496 --> 00:31:30.317]  The EU's moving forward with that.
[00:31:31.017 --> 00:31:34.958]  They're talking about doing it here now with a bill that has a good chance of passing.
[00:31:35.038 --> 00:31:37.039]  This is from Insight News, Associated Press.
[00:31:38.059 --> 00:31:38.739]  Also, U.S.
[00:31:38.819 --> 00:31:40.220]  offers to report to U.N.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.220]  on Iraq.
[00:31:42.481 --> 00:31:43.541]  So now they're going to bring the U.N.
[00:31:43.561 --> 00:31:45.081]  troops in, plus Russian troops.
[00:31:45.442 --> 00:31:46.822]  France and Germany are skeptical.
[00:31:46.962 --> 00:31:49.903]  Oh yeah, they're playing good cop in all this when they're behind it.
[00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:56.753]  More on voting machines being run by the CIA and being totally fraudulent from the mainstream news, folks.
[00:31:57.834 --> 00:32:01.416]  But again, you won't see it on Good Morning America or on the O'Reilly Factor.
[00:32:02.397 --> 00:32:05.178]  Also, I want to read this editorial out of the Casper Star Tribune.
[00:32:05.238 --> 00:32:07.360]  Victory Act would be no victory for the public.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.522]  It's the best editorial, best news article I've seen so far.
[00:32:10.542 --> 00:32:15.204]  It's by Charles Lindosky, Star Tribune staff writer.
[00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:17.866]  So I guess it's not even really an editorial, it's just a news report.
[00:32:18.684 --> 00:32:26.547]  Also, abortion doctor's killer executed in Florida, but they're going to execute the guy, one of the guys that killed the lady who was pregnant.
[00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:28.308]  I have trouble understanding that.
[00:32:29.448 --> 00:32:30.949]  I mean, is it a baby or isn't it?
[00:32:31.169 --> 00:32:32.230]  I think we all know it is.
[00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:40.593]  Where do you stand on the execution of the man that killed the guy that ran the abortuarium?
[00:32:41.513 --> 00:32:44.014]  So, more information coming up.
[00:32:44.034 --> 00:32:45.175]  Just a bunch of news.
[00:32:46.272 --> 00:32:48.932]  So definitely, folks, stay with us.
[00:32:50.233 --> 00:32:58.614]  Right now, I want to, just for a couple minutes, and I'm honored to have him back, Jim Shepard, because yesterday we got caught short on time.
[00:32:59.034 --> 00:33:14.697]  I had the top doctor, the top scientist, testify to the FDA and to the National Federation of Scientists and others about how deadly fluoride is and how there's other toxic waste being added to it because the stuff we're putting in the water is right out of the fertilizer and aluminum plants.
[00:33:15.257 --> 00:33:37.377]  We posted all the big mainstream studies on Infowars.com, the retardation of children, the IQ reduction, how it gets into the glands in the brain and causes brain damage by design and joining us is Jim Shepard so we can tell folks how to protect themselves with the highest quality gravity filters on the market made right here in America.
[00:33:37.697 --> 00:33:38.758]  Jim, tell them all about it.
[00:33:39.499 --> 00:33:39.819]  Okay.
[00:33:41.192 --> 00:33:47.454]  Alex, the Berkey Light, we really went to the extreme on developing the filter elements that go in there.
[00:33:47.514 --> 00:33:58.259]  We've developed a brand new technology that nobody else utilizes or even understands for the gravity filter system.
[00:33:59.099 --> 00:34:05.081]  And the advantages are that it takes about five minutes for each molecule to pass through that water filter.
[00:34:05.101 --> 00:34:09.603]  So we're just able to extract out more contaminants than anybody else is.
[00:34:10.709 --> 00:34:20.852]  In fact, with respect to pathogenic bacteria, we had the system tested with tens of more pathogens per liter of water than you would normally test the system.
[00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:33.655]  And based on the amount of pathogens we put through it, you would expect the normal system that can remove pathogenic bacteria to have at least 100,000 microbes, pathogenic bacteria that got through the filter.
[00:34:34.415 --> 00:34:37.076]  And our filters demonstrated that nothing got through.
[00:34:38.095 --> 00:34:38.956]  Absolutely nothing.
[00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:55.196]  In fact, the laboratory that tested couldn't believe their results, decided that they would incubate the water and told us that if there was even one microbe, one pathogen in there, that that water would be toxic by the time they got through incubating the water.
[00:34:55.839 --> 00:34:58.680]  And when they incubated it, they could get nothing to grow.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.061]  So folks, this is a new standard.
[00:35:01.562 --> 00:35:07.064]  You've got replacement filters for other filter bodies that folks have bought, container bodies.
[00:35:07.104 --> 00:35:11.366]  You've got new systems that are clear that have the light system for emergency lighting at night.
[00:35:11.666 --> 00:35:14.307]  You have the solar panels that charge rechargeable batteries.
[00:35:14.527 --> 00:35:16.088]  There's no moving parts in the filter.
[00:35:16.108 --> 00:35:20.810]  This is a light system that's in the base that will light a good-sized room you can read by.
[00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:22.211]  A lot of different offers.
[00:35:22.471 --> 00:35:23.531]  Tell folks about them, Jim.
[00:35:23.571 --> 00:35:24.672]  It's a great filter system.
[00:35:25.012 --> 00:35:25.292]  Okay.
[00:35:26.382 --> 00:35:43.966]  And by the way, I just want to stress the point that we designed this for everyday filtration environments when you just want to have your water purified, but we also designed it for hostile filtration environments where electricity is not available, light is not available, water pressure.
[00:35:46.347 --> 00:35:47.227]  Are you talking, Alex?
[00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.831]  I'm sorry, I was saying lakes and ponds.
[00:35:50.151 --> 00:35:52.573]  That's right, and stagnant ponds.
[00:35:52.653 --> 00:35:57.516]  You can basically get water from just about any source out there and purify that water.
[00:35:58.557 --> 00:36:16.168]  We have two specials that we are going to run, and you can look these specials up on BerkeyLight.com, B-E-R-K-E-Y-L-I-G-H-T dot com, and punch on the Alex Jones link, and it will bring the specials up.
[00:36:17.143 --> 00:36:20.805]  Uh, we have the Berkey Light without the emergency lighting system in it.
[00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:25.048]  Uh, and, uh, this special, by the way, is a $373 value.
[00:36:25.088 --> 00:36:27.629]  The special for this month is $298, which is the $75 special.
[00:36:27.649 --> 00:36:30.410]  In that special, you get one Berkey Light without the emergency lights.
[00:36:37.509 --> 00:36:51.540]  You get two bottles of potassium iodate or two sport bottles so you can bring the power of the filtration system with you in a convenient manner, put it in your glove box, take it to work, give one to the kids for their college dorm.
[00:36:53.001 --> 00:36:58.446]  And so you can get either the two sport bottles or two potassium iodate or you can mix and match.
[00:36:58.466 --> 00:37:00.527]  Get one of each or get two potassium iodate.
[00:37:00.787 --> 00:37:02.389]  Okay, Jim, real quick, finish up.
[00:37:02.749 --> 00:37:03.790]  Okay, and then we've got
[00:37:04.673 --> 00:37:08.054]  The two additional replacement black Berkey filter elements.
[00:37:08.074 --> 00:37:10.015]  These are the powerful purification elements.
[00:37:11.695 --> 00:37:19.117]  And then if you add $25 to that, we'll send you, in addition to that, a $50 set of the fluoride reduction filters.
[00:37:19.517 --> 00:37:23.359]  Now, the second special is the Berkey light with the emergency lights.
[00:37:24.379 --> 00:37:25.799]  And this is a $445 special.
[00:37:25.859 --> 00:37:26.439]  You get it for $345, $100 off.
[00:37:32.365 --> 00:37:34.707]  Uh, you get the Berkey light with the emergency light.
[00:37:35.288 --> 00:37:40.132]  Uh, you also get the two potassium iodate or two sport bottles or mix and match.
[00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:43.916]  You also get two additional black Berkey replacement elements.
[00:37:44.496 --> 00:37:48.120]  And we're going to include a battery adapter pack for the emergency light.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.762]  And that emergency light will run for two weeks.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:52.541]  I don't think so.
[00:38:13.263 --> 00:38:15.445]  Now this new line is made right here in America.
[00:38:15.465 --> 00:38:20.469]  The Berkey Light 1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:20.609 --> 00:38:24.912]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:38:24.932 --> 00:38:29.756]  I had Jim up yesterday and we cut him a little bit short.
[00:38:29.796 --> 00:38:33.439]  I begged him to come back on to promote this because it's so important.
[00:38:33.439 --> 00:38:34.259]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:34.279 --> 00:38:48.084]  And if you just want the filters themselves, the units to go inside, they've got the O-ring adapters to fit your filter model.
[00:38:48.464 --> 00:38:52.245]  They've got a lot of different other great items, so definitely ask about that as well.
[00:38:52.265 --> 00:38:55.267]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:58.888]  And Jim, that website one more time for the Alex Jones Special.
[00:38:59.708 --> 00:39:01.608]  Berkeylight.com.
[00:39:01.688 --> 00:39:06.689]  B-E-R-K-E-Y-L-I-G-H-T, just like Lightbulb.
[00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:15.151]  And you can see pictures of all the units, you can see all the accessories, and get descriptions of what they're capable of doing.
[00:39:15.231 --> 00:39:17.852]  Okay, Jim, thanks a million for coming on, and God bless you.
[00:39:18.752 --> 00:39:19.152]  Bless you.
[00:39:19.392 --> 00:39:19.892]  Take care.
[00:39:19.992 --> 00:39:26.194]  Again, that's 888-253-3139 for my videos, or the books, or the films.
[00:39:26.654 --> 00:39:28.074]  I say that because people call that
[00:39:28.712 --> 00:39:29.593]  Thank you Alex.
[00:39:29.613 --> 00:39:35.418]  There's a new propaganda theater that popped up the last couple of days and I wanted to get your take on it.
[00:39:56.776 --> 00:40:05.982]  The United States Supreme Court has unconstitutionalized some laws, sentencing laws, in the southwestern part of the United States, particularly Arizona.
[00:40:06.643 --> 00:40:07.723]  Basically, the U.S.
[00:40:07.763 --> 00:40:13.247]  Supreme Court is stating that judges cannot pass sentence on capital punishment cases.
[00:40:14.198 --> 00:40:15.179]  Yeah, which is a lie.
[00:40:15.539 --> 00:40:21.723]  Basically what the Sixth Amendment says... What do you expect to happen when you've got seven of the nine members appointed by Republicans?
[00:40:22.104 --> 00:40:32.811]  Socialism, communism, federalism, centralization, and you expect mindless, idiot Republicans to worship this liberalism and call it conservatism.
[00:40:33.051 --> 00:40:35.413]  What do you get when seven of the nine are appointed by Republicans?
[00:40:35.613 --> 00:40:36.954]  You get ten commandments taken down.
[00:40:37.454 --> 00:40:41.016]  Well, you get Ruth Ginsburg, she's the one that wrote the majority opinion.
[00:40:41.056 --> 00:40:43.437]  But they got Republicans voting with them, that's not fair.
[00:40:43.457 --> 00:40:45.038]  I agree, I agree.
[00:40:45.058 --> 00:40:45.678]  Let me finish though.
[00:40:46.179 --> 00:40:54.583]  One of the milestones is that the Sixth Amendment says that in all criminal prosecutions, meaning the word all, like robbery, rape, and fraud.
[00:40:54.623 --> 00:41:00.025]  So no judge anywhere in the United States can pass sentence on any criminal prosecution.
[00:41:00.646 --> 00:41:04.908]  But they're not saying that the word capital punishment is not in.
[00:41:05.407 --> 00:41:06.048]  The Sixth Amendment.
[00:41:06.188 --> 00:41:10.391]  Helpful Punishment is not used in the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America.
[00:41:10.431 --> 00:41:13.354]  What he's saying is that the jury does that.
[00:41:13.794 --> 00:41:15.836]  Well yeah, so here's what we're seeing in Arizona.
[00:41:15.876 --> 00:41:17.677]  Here's what we're seeing in Arizona.
[00:41:17.757 --> 00:41:21.660]  Judges can't hand out death penalties when obviously the death penalty is coming out of the jury.
[00:41:22.501 --> 00:41:23.262]  Well, that's correct.
[00:41:23.302 --> 00:41:23.942]  That's what happens.
[00:41:24.082 --> 00:41:26.044]  Now, here's my question to you.
[00:41:26.865 --> 00:41:32.169]  It's clear that for the last 85 years the state judiciary has been unconstitutional.
[00:41:33.018 --> 00:41:44.122]  And that anyone in prison right now for any criminal act, you know, had his rights destroyed by the local judges, are they going to release all the criminals?
[00:41:44.362 --> 00:41:44.563]  That's it!
[00:41:44.623 --> 00:41:45.303]  I mean, that's it!
[00:41:46.043 --> 00:41:47.344]  Are they going to release all the criminals?
[00:41:47.364 --> 00:41:48.464]  Is that what this thing is about?
[00:41:49.024 --> 00:41:50.025]  No, they're not going to do that.
[00:41:50.065 --> 00:41:57.087]  What they're going to do is, you see, they use the Constitution when they want, and they twist it to destroy our rights, and when they don't, they totally ignore it.
[00:41:57.548 --> 00:42:00.749]  Judges are supposed to sit there and do a little bit of mediation,
[00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:21.502]  Uh, to make sure the Constitution is followed, the jury asks the questions, runs things, is never removed, uh, judges the facts as well as the law, and, and, and if they think the government's cheating, they're supposed to let somebody go, even if they think they're guilty, because the government's more dangerous than all the little criminals combined.
[00:42:21.542 --> 00:42:24.064]  Our founding fathers said that, it's historical fact.
[00:42:24.504 --> 00:42:26.305]  So what they do is they take this and twist it.
[00:42:26.365 --> 00:42:28.965]  And yes, judges aren't supposed to hand down sentences.
[00:42:29.505 --> 00:42:32.686]  Judges are just supposed to go to the jury with that.
[00:42:32.946 --> 00:42:38.008]  But they so removed what the jury was that people don't even know that today.
[00:42:38.028 --> 00:42:40.168]  I agree with you.
[00:42:40.188 --> 00:42:43.509]  There's something evil happening in the court system, or has happened.
[00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:56.683]  Yeah, first they take the power from the people in the jury box that's just like the ballot box, and the grand jury, they turn that into rubber stamp for prosecutors and judges, and now they're just taking it from the local judges as well.
[00:42:57.164 --> 00:42:58.104]  See, that's how it works.
[00:42:58.205 --> 00:43:04.171]  First, they take it from the people, then the local thugs who work for the feds, then from the local thugs to the feds.
[00:43:05.273 --> 00:43:06.213]  Yeah, it looks like it.
[00:43:06.233 --> 00:43:07.334]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:43:07.434 --> 00:43:08.694]  So, you know, we're setting it up.
[00:43:08.774 --> 00:43:10.775]  I mean, it's in the newspaper the last couple of days.
[00:43:10.835 --> 00:43:13.355]  Hey, they've announced that the Supreme Court follows the U.N.
[00:43:13.655 --> 00:43:16.716]  I saw that, yeah.
[00:43:16.756 --> 00:43:19.437]  We have to have the United Nations Treaty unconstitutionalized.
[00:43:20.017 --> 00:43:23.458]  Well, I mean, they've said that the final arbiter is the U.N.
[00:43:24.038 --> 00:43:26.659]  and these foreign, quote, international courts.
[00:43:27.339 --> 00:43:29.761]  In all the major papers, they're just throwing it in your face.
[00:43:30.041 --> 00:43:31.302]  I talk about this eight years ago.
[00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:33.644]  I get callers going, that's ridiculous.
[00:43:33.964 --> 00:43:35.846]  I was reading UN plans.
[00:43:36.266 --> 00:43:38.088]  I was reading the federal government's plans.
[00:43:38.848 --> 00:43:40.910]  The Bar Association says we're getting rid of juries.
[00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:42.752]  They're getting rid of attorney-client privileges.
[00:43:42.932 --> 00:43:45.414]  People still can't believe it, as it's happening.
[00:43:45.454 --> 00:43:46.234]  Thanks for the call.
[00:43:46.435 --> 00:43:46.795]  You're welcome.
[00:43:47.355 --> 00:43:48.416]  Yeah, it's like yesterday.
[00:43:48.436 --> 00:43:50.958]  You know, they admit there's all this poison in the fluoride.
[00:43:50.978 --> 00:43:54.621]  Not just the fluoride, but added poison, heavy metals, Grignard reagents.
[00:43:56.815 --> 00:43:58.235]  Well, you know, we have the experts on.
[00:43:58.275 --> 00:44:01.876]  Mainstream news admits that the CIA is running the touchscreens.
[00:44:01.916 --> 00:44:03.016]  It's a total fraud.
[00:44:03.036 --> 00:44:06.157]  Damn, the average person has no idea.
[00:44:06.597 --> 00:44:08.838]  I try to tell people that the Iraq War is a fraud.
[00:44:09.098 --> 00:44:11.598]  These yuppies don't even know where Iraq is.
[00:44:13.299 --> 00:44:16.580]  They don't even know that they're socialists and think they're conservative.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.820]  I mean, we just have a nation of idiots.
[00:44:21.181 --> 00:44:21.941]  Not ignorant.
[00:44:22.924 --> 00:44:24.266]  People aren't stupid.
[00:44:24.426 --> 00:44:30.433]  They're focused in on my... They can tell you all the baseball scores, all the football scores, all the hockey scores.
[00:44:30.894 --> 00:44:37.202]  They can tell you all about motorcycles, or all about trucks, or all about the size of a cam on a Corvette.
[00:44:37.822 --> 00:44:41.407]  They can tell you all about the best bar to go to to pick up women.
[00:44:42.068 --> 00:44:45.531]  But they can't tell you what the 4th or 5th or 10th Amendment is.
[00:44:45.791 --> 00:44:49.734]  They can't tell you what America is about or what the flag symbolizes.
[00:44:49.915 --> 00:45:01.124]  And they'll tell somebody who knows what America is and who's really defending America that you're not patriotic because you're not a mindless, drooling... Again, they're not mindless.
[00:45:01.264 --> 00:45:03.886]  They're focused into mindless stuff.
[00:45:03.906 --> 00:45:05.628]  They're experts on the inane.
[00:45:06.201 --> 00:45:08.864]  They're experts on PAP and stuff of no substance.
[00:45:09.104 --> 00:45:11.566]  Stuff that doesn't matter today, much less in 10 years.
[00:45:11.926 --> 00:45:21.515]  Our whole civilization, the middle class, our families, our heritage, is all being destroyed by the neocons and their liberal buddies.
[00:45:22.316 --> 00:45:23.197]  It makes me sick.
[00:45:24.038 --> 00:45:26.120]  James in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:45:26.658 --> 00:45:28.219]  Yeah, I just got a real quick question, Alex.
[00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:35.525]  I heard last week about the Klamath County Sheriff that had his arms confiscated by the Federals when the President visited on the 27th.
[00:45:35.565 --> 00:45:37.407]  No due process, no charges.
[00:45:37.427 --> 00:45:39.469]  I was just listening to the radio this morning.
[00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:41.050]  They were reading the news articles.
[00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:43.692]  They had Jay-Z and Wally on from the Paragon Foundation.
[00:45:44.072 --> 00:45:48.816]  All over the West, they grab people's private cows off their land that they've owned for a hundred years.
[00:45:49.337 --> 00:45:55.622]  They take them and sell them and violate state laws that say that the person has to have a bill of sale or a deed.
[00:45:56.202 --> 00:46:02.510]  I mean, the government just grabs your house, grabs your cows, grabs your kids without a warrant, without a judge, without a jury.
[00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:06.355]  The IRS grabs your bank accounts without indicting you, without convicting you.
[00:46:06.615 --> 00:46:08.477]  We've been in tyranny a long time.
[00:46:08.958 --> 00:46:15.185]  Oh yeah, but that one event of the county sheriff losing that right to have his own arms.
[00:46:15.982 --> 00:46:16.463]  I don't think so.
[00:46:26.758 --> 00:46:29.981]  That you had it on InfoWars or Info... I can't find the article.
[00:46:30.001 --> 00:46:31.942]  Gary Brownfield broke that story.
[00:46:32.383 --> 00:46:32.903]  Gary Brownfield?
[00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:34.825]  Gary Brownfield's been on the air about 40 years.
[00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:37.266]  One of the longest continuing broadcasters in the country.
[00:46:37.627 --> 00:46:46.574]  He's on this network on over 100 stations and he broke that story and it was on Fox News last Monday night and it was on CNN too.
[00:46:47.415 --> 00:46:51.158]  Okay, so how would I be able to... Well, you know, here's the problem.
[00:46:51.518 --> 00:46:53.239]  Do you know how to get into my archives?
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.241]  Right, your archives, okay.
[00:46:56.465 --> 00:46:58.165]  See, we post articles every day.
[00:46:58.646 --> 00:46:58.926]  Uh-huh.
[00:46:59.266 --> 00:47:05.907]  And in two weeks you may ask, where's the Arnold Schwarzenegger article that's right up there at the top of the page that I wrote?
[00:47:06.447 --> 00:47:07.028]  Right, right.
[00:47:07.068 --> 00:47:08.448]  But in a week you may say, where is it?
[00:47:08.508 --> 00:47:09.608]  You're going to have to go find it.
[00:47:10.348 --> 00:47:10.448]  Right.
[00:47:10.468 --> 00:47:13.869]  I can't explain navigating the websites here on the air, unfortunately.
[00:47:13.909 --> 00:47:14.949]  Oh, I understand that.
[00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:17.490]  So my best bet would be to go to Fox News to get that article.
[00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:20.191]  Well, also, do you know how to use a search engine?
[00:47:21.251 --> 00:47:21.971]  I used that.
[00:47:22.011 --> 00:47:24.272]  I couldn't find anything with that.
[00:47:24.392 --> 00:47:25.332]  What did you type in?
[00:47:25.908 --> 00:47:26.849]  I'm a county sheriff.
[00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:29.391]  President's visit.
[00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:32.973]  I just... I'm sorry.
[00:47:33.274 --> 00:47:34.194]  Try different headlines.
[00:47:34.715 --> 00:47:35.595]  Okay, okay.
[00:47:36.016 --> 00:47:38.558]  I'm definitely going to have to dig that article back out and cover it again.
[00:47:38.578 --> 00:47:40.039]  Yeah, I understand.
[00:47:40.299 --> 00:47:42.260]  But I do appreciate all you're doing, Alex.
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.241]  Thanks so much.
[00:47:43.501 --> 00:47:44.842]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[00:47:44.882 --> 00:47:45.663]  I really appreciate it.
[00:47:45.683 --> 00:47:49.686]  We're going to come back and go to John in Tennessee and others.
[00:47:51.064 --> 00:47:55.847]  You know, I've been getting emails, where's this Plain Dealer article, Voting Machine Controversy?
[00:47:55.887 --> 00:48:11.195]  Well, it's on the website, and Columbus, the head of a company vying to sell voting machines in Ohio, told Republicans in a recent fundraising letter that he is committed to, quote, helping Ohio deliver its election votes to the President next year.
[00:48:12.015 --> 00:48:18.739]  Then they got into one of these meetings, and it was the government and all these people talking about how the CIA is running the election, and they caught
[00:48:19.384 --> 00:48:23.725]  Diebold, the company in question here, messing with the votes.
[00:48:23.786 --> 00:48:25.446]  I mean, this is mainstream news, folks.
[00:48:26.306 --> 00:48:27.867]  That's... can't miss it.
[00:48:27.887 --> 00:48:28.647]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:31.328 --> 00:48:35.649]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:48:35.849 --> 00:48:40.251]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:48:40.411 --> 00:48:44.792]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:48:44.892 --> 00:48:46.173]  A New World Order.
[00:48:47.976 --> 00:48:52.182]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[00:49:02.177 --> 00:49:12.120]  Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:17.722]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:49:34.188 --> 00:49:34.969]  Worked good for me.
[00:49:35.149 --> 00:49:38.531]  I'm going to have to go get re-measured because my pants are getting kind of baggy on me.
[00:49:38.671 --> 00:49:40.152]  My stomach is not there no more.
[00:49:40.232 --> 00:49:41.153]  It's really very easy.
[00:49:41.353 --> 00:49:42.294]  Helps me sleep good.
[00:49:42.554 --> 00:49:43.074]  Lose weight.
[00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:43.915]  Tones me up.
[00:49:44.235 --> 00:49:44.815]  Hey, I like it.
[00:49:45.196 --> 00:49:51.920]  Trying to lose weight for someone in a wheelchair is extremely frustrating and the first month that I tried it, I lost 6 pounds.

[00:50:31.155 --> 00:50:36.516]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:50:36.656 --> 00:50:44.877]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:50:45.137 --> 00:50:53.779]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[00:50:53.859 --> 00:50:59.800]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:05.204]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:51:05.324 --> 00:51:14.310]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodine form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:20.194]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:35.764]  All right, my friends.
[00:51:35.864 --> 00:51:37.886]  We're back live.
[00:51:37.946 --> 00:51:41.728]  Thanks for tuning in to the show.
[00:51:55.609 --> 00:52:04.711]  And we're about to go back to John and Ron and many others that are patiently holding the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:52:04.751 --> 00:52:10.732]  And we are covering the news here.
[00:52:11.272 --> 00:52:13.513]  In fact, I'm about to get back into some of the news.
[00:52:13.553 --> 00:52:23.515]  Before I do that, I want to encourage all the listeners of this radio broadcast
[00:52:24.688 --> 00:52:32.354]  To go to the website, Infowars.com, and get my new film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:52:32.874 --> 00:52:38.799]  The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, and it is a must-see.
[00:52:38.859 --> 00:52:53.010]  It covers Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, government-run white slavery rings, just dozens and dozens of examples of government-sponsored terror, forced inoculation, gun control.
[00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:54.251]  It's all there.
[00:52:55.476 --> 00:52:57.559]  It is a very important film.
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.203]  You need to have it to wake people up.
[00:53:00.303 --> 00:53:04.390]  And yes, your purchase of the film supports this broadcast and what we're doing.
[00:53:05.051 --> 00:53:11.040]  So if you want to find out about government-sponsored terror and just all these other key subjects,
[00:53:12.398 --> 00:53:14.439]  Want to find out about the phony left-right paradigm?
[00:53:14.459 --> 00:53:15.660]  The film really gets into that.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.922]  PNAC, Project for a New American Century, Prior Knowledge, and you know, there's some 9-1-1 stuff too.
[00:53:20.522 --> 00:53:27.105]  Get Police State 3 Total Enslavement, the new book by Paul Watson, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and The New World Order.
[00:53:27.785 --> 00:53:30.887]  It is also available through Infowars.com.
[00:53:31.247 --> 00:53:33.668]  Call toll-free to get the books, the films, the tapes,
[00:53:34.252 --> 00:53:37.073]  Now, the other great books we carry by Fritz Springmeier and Tex Mars, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:53:37.093 --> 00:53:37.533]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:53:52.931 --> 00:54:02.535]  Or, Infowars.com or net, or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:54:03.995 --> 00:54:04.956]  Take action, folks.
[00:54:05.296 --> 00:54:07.617]  They also make great Christmas gifts or great birthday gifts.
[00:54:07.637 --> 00:54:15.400]  Instead of giving somebody some mindless football jersey of some gladiatorial idiocy, why not give them road to tyranny?
[00:54:16.164 --> 00:54:17.865]  Why not give them Descent into Tyranny, the book.
[00:54:18.245 --> 00:54:18.666]  My book.
[00:54:18.726 --> 00:54:20.027]  Why not give them Order Out of Chaos?
[00:54:20.087 --> 00:54:20.867]  Take action, folks.
[00:54:20.887 --> 00:54:20.927]  888-253-3139.
[00:54:21.187 --> 00:54:23.229]  Now, let's go ahead and go to John in Tennessee.
[00:54:23.249 --> 00:54:23.969]  Go ahead, John.
[00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:49.792]  Driver's licenses make ID theft worse, not better.
[00:54:50.412 --> 00:54:58.676]  Tennessee is where the 9-1-1 alleged hijackers got their driver's licenses, and the DMV clerk who stole them arsoned herself for a trial.
[00:54:59.216 --> 00:55:00.457]  Yeah, do you really believe that?
[00:55:00.477 --> 00:55:02.978]  Burned herself up in a car.
[00:55:03.599 --> 00:55:16.125]  Yeah, also on the same TV news broadcast, the police chief of La Follette, Tennessee, which is a small town, has five stars on his collar like a five-star general, but four-star generals only get promoted during World Wars.
[00:55:17.205 --> 00:55:30.728]  Now, when Abby Newman was arrested for refusing to provide a driver's license at a checkpoint, prosecutors apparently dismissed the charge for no driver's license, since she did not own a voluntary driver's license contract.
[00:55:32.168 --> 00:55:32.868]  In the U.S.
[00:55:32.888 --> 00:55:40.890]  Supreme Court cases, I believe it was Terry v. Ohio, ID only was required, not a driver's license, since that case involved a pedestrian.
[00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:44.331]  That's what police call a Terry stop for traffic stops.
[00:55:45.233 --> 00:55:55.786]  So it seems to me that if a person chooses not to volunteer for a driver's license contract, they only need to carry a photo ID in order to comply with the law and show it to a cop in a traffic stop.
[00:55:57.188 --> 00:56:00.051]  Well, you know, that's what the Bill of Rights and Constitution says.
[00:56:00.072 --> 00:56:01.754]  It's what the federal ruling said until the 1920s.
[00:56:03.562 --> 00:56:06.183]  But again, cops say it's a privilege, not a right.
[00:56:06.223 --> 00:56:08.344]  Now they're saying guns are a privilege, see?
[00:56:08.924 --> 00:56:12.005]  And in another decade, you'll be the kook for saying it's a right.
[00:56:12.525 --> 00:56:13.646]  This is how they warped mine.
[00:56:13.706 --> 00:56:14.466]  Sure, stay there.
[00:56:14.486 --> 00:56:18.427]  More calls, bunch of news, second and third hours, straight ahead.
[00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:30.231]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:56:30.451 --> 00:56:32.072]  The BerkeyLite self-sterilizing...
[00:56:36.047 --> 00:56:39.268]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:47.449]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.089 --> 00:56:49.189]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.030]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:52.470]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:54.090]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:58.551]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.951 --> 00:57:03.052]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:08.633 --> 00:57:14.000]  I'm Alex Jones, the test pilot of Talk Radio.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.223]  I really am, folks, in more ways than you know.
[00:57:16.243 --> 00:57:18.005]  The test pilot.
[00:57:18.105 --> 00:57:21.490]  I stand here before you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:31.984]  We've got a lot of news and information coming up on the show today, tonight, this morning, depending on what time zone you're listening to us in.
[00:57:32.004 --> 00:57:33.425]  And we're going to take a lot of calls.
[00:57:33.905 --> 00:57:36.407]  The total free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:57:36.427 --> 00:57:36.667]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:57:47.489 --> 00:57:53.090]  And we're about to go right back to your calls, and yes, get into a lot of the news that I've already mentioned, but haven't detailed yet.
[00:57:53.791 --> 00:57:55.331]  Let's go back to John in Tennessee.
[00:57:55.451 --> 00:57:57.291]  John, you're on the air with Chuck Yeager.
[00:57:57.331 --> 00:57:57.731]  Go ahead.
[00:57:59.212 --> 00:58:01.072]  Well, Pastor Bush Pa raised $5,000.
[00:58:01.132 --> 00:58:03.193]  By the way, that's an inside joke, okay?
[00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:05.333]  Do not think I'm Chuck Yeager, folks.
[00:58:05.373 --> 00:58:06.134]  Go ahead.
[00:58:06.154 --> 00:58:08.914]  And I don't have the right stuff, by the way, but go ahead.
[00:58:09.414 --> 00:58:13.015]  Well, Pastor Bush Pa raised $5,000 for Abby Newman.
[00:58:13.055 --> 00:58:16.296]  She was facing life and debtors prison on death row for civil
[00:58:17.043 --> 00:58:19.725]  And that's what they did with the Diana Lupi out in, what's the state, Colorado.
[00:58:43.513 --> 00:58:49.659]  They said this is admiralty and we can arrest you forever under stuff that isn't even a misdemeanor.
[00:58:50.019 --> 00:58:50.239]  Right.
[00:58:50.339 --> 00:58:53.582]  It's just now, you know, it's asset forfeiture seizure.
[00:58:53.902 --> 00:59:00.809]  If your kid gets caught having a beer party when you're out of town in New Mexico cities, they'll take your house.
[00:59:00.869 --> 00:59:04.432]  And you go, well, you can't have a jury because it's not even a felony.
[00:59:04.772 --> 00:59:08.656]  Well, it's admiralty because any little creek is
[00:59:09.431 --> 00:59:09.972]  We're good to go.
[00:59:29.915 --> 00:59:32.356]  Now on Butch Paw's show last night, you said the U.S.
[00:59:32.396 --> 00:59:34.736]  government wants 30 million Americans in prison by 2010.
[00:59:34.836 --> 00:59:41.698]  Well, Butch was reading an AP article, and I've seen them on CBS News say 33 million.
[00:59:42.618 --> 00:59:45.019]  They've got different numbers, but yeah.
[00:59:45.219 --> 00:59:57.942]  And look, the rates from just a million five years ago up to tens of millions in the system, five million at any one time behind bars, seven and a half million on some type of controlled
[00:59:59.702 --> 01:00:00.383]  We're good to go.
[01:00:12.496 --> 01:00:18.721]  Uh, so another lawyer could extort $25,000 cash from my family for a court-costing attorney fee.
[01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:20.323]  Well, yeah, that's how the scam works.
[01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:25.927]  The local lawyers are there to play a game, suck you dry, and then have you plea bargain to a lesser charge.
[01:00:26.067 --> 01:00:30.551]  If you're lucky, now they're going to openly work with the court to make sure you get convicted.
[01:00:30.851 --> 01:00:36.496]  Well, he even lost his law license on the same day as Judge Roy Moore lost his law license for civil contempt.
[01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:41.912]  And my brother's in one of the law firms suing the Saudis for their role in 9-1-1.
[01:00:42.112 --> 01:00:49.074]  And arrests for civil contempt can happen to any person, in any case, civil or criminal, at any time.
[01:00:49.334 --> 01:00:50.415]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:00:50.435 --> 01:00:51.935]  Appreciate it, John.
[01:00:52.256 --> 01:00:55.537]  Yeah, and people say, oh, the Patriot Act's taking all our rights, and it is.
[01:00:55.597 --> 01:00:56.117]  It's horrible.
[01:00:56.963 --> 01:01:00.466]  Secret arrest, secret execution, but what about asset forfeiture seizure?
[01:01:00.786 --> 01:01:05.050]  You all heard the stories in your town of the old lady with the $5,000 in her purse.
[01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:05.991]  She didn't trust banks.
[01:01:06.351 --> 01:01:07.232]  The cop pulls her over.
[01:01:07.672 --> 01:01:08.693]  Let me search your vehicle.
[01:01:08.753 --> 01:01:09.374]  Finds the money.
[01:01:09.414 --> 01:01:10.054]  Why do you have this?
[01:01:10.094 --> 01:01:10.735]  Well, it's my money.
[01:01:11.275 --> 01:01:11.916]  We're taking this.
[01:01:11.956 --> 01:01:12.777]  This could be drugs.
[01:01:12.857 --> 01:01:13.797]  They test the bills.
[01:01:14.058 --> 01:01:16.480]  If any of the bills have drugs on it, which almost all bills do.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.021]  Oh, see, you have drugs.
[01:01:18.261 --> 01:01:19.162]  We're going to keep the money.
[01:01:19.182 --> 01:01:21.304]  You don't even have to find drugs on it to take the money, though.
[01:01:22.004 --> 01:01:32.675]  And all the time we see old ladies at checkpoints, hands behind their heads, cops all over them throwing their goods out, while vans of illegal aliens just swoop by.
[01:01:32.695 --> 01:01:37.140]  Alright, I'll be back in my X-14 after this quick break.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.501]  Stay with me.
[01:01:43.149 --> 01:01:50.532]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:55.534]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:01:55.754 --> 01:02:01.416]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:02:01.656 --> 01:02:06.181]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:02:06.402 --> 01:02:13.570]  The tax was society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:17.995]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:02:18.275 --> 01:02:20.796]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:02:21.016 --> 01:02:27.759]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:03:03.157 --> 01:03:03.597]  I think so.

[01:04:32.283 --> 01:04:33.264]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:33.404 --> 01:04:34.625]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:55.209 --> 01:05:04.876]  I had the mothers coming on from that public school where they strip-searched a bunch of the girls, but I just cancelled them because we needed to cover other news and other topics.
[01:05:04.936 --> 01:05:17.084]  I mean, teenage and, well, pre-teen girls being strip-searched, in some cases by men, and hidden cameras in the showers is so widespread now it's not even really a news item.
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:26.384]  In the public schools, you know, SWAT teams coming to the wrong house and gunning down families, dogs, cats, neighbors, cops.
[01:05:27.065 --> 01:05:27.825]  So normal.
[01:05:27.845 --> 01:05:30.787]  It's like reporting that the sun came out this morning.
[01:05:31.707 --> 01:05:39.031]  Pretty soon, reporting on the touch screens being run by the CIA and there being no more elections, that'll be so passe, you know, no discussion of it.
[01:05:39.211 --> 01:05:40.212]  I'm being serious here.
[01:05:42.603 --> 01:05:43.863]  It's all just wall to wall.
[01:05:43.903 --> 01:05:46.324]  I mean, it's like 9-1-1 prior knowledge yesterday.
[01:05:46.384 --> 01:06:01.247]  It came out in the Washington Times and Boston Globe and a bunch of other major papers that, oh yeah, the Bush White House ordered the entire Bin Laden family and a bunch of other terrorists and people connected to terrorists to be flown out of the U.S.
[01:06:01.267 --> 01:06:08.429]  to safety on September 11th, the day after September 11th, while everybody else's planes were totally grounded.
[01:06:09.668 --> 01:06:11.329]  The Bin Ladens could fly out to safety.
[01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:14.010]  You know, I hardly even mentioned that yesterday.
[01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:15.971]  We've been reporting it for so many years now.
[01:06:16.531 --> 01:06:17.371]  Almost two years.
[01:06:17.431 --> 01:06:22.694]  Coming up on about, I don't know, it's about 23 and a half months ago we started reporting this.
[01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:27.576]  It's one of the things they have on the nightly news they say is an urban legend isn't true.
[01:06:27.596 --> 01:06:32.038]  Kind of like the instant messaging service.
[01:06:33.101 --> 01:06:34.882]  That warned all its employees not to go to work.
[01:06:35.243 --> 01:06:37.444]  MSNBC found out that was true.
[01:06:38.024 --> 01:06:42.227]  But again, it's an urban legend, according to certain organizations that claim that you're evil if you say it.
[01:06:42.908 --> 01:06:44.188]  Well, I'm just going to say it again.
[01:06:45.329 --> 01:06:55.236]  The world's round, and the sun does come out in the morning, and the government is out of control, and illegitimate, and corrupt, and carrying out acts of terror to scare us into submission.
[01:06:55.696 --> 01:07:01.600]  I'm going to cover some news, and we'll go to Wesleyan, Tennessee, Renee in Alberta, Canada.
[01:07:02.399 --> 01:07:07.865]  And Billy Bob in South Texas and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[01:07:07.885 --> 01:07:11.830]  If you want to join us on air, the toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:12.110]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:41.414]  And if you want to call in and tell me I'm crazy and bad because I don't want the Supreme Court to follow the orders of the UN, because I think that we should have attorney-client privilege with the lawyers, that I think double jeopardy is a bad thing, trying twice for the same crime, I think the Second Amendment is an individual right, enshrined by the Second Amendment, and God-given.
[01:07:42.955 --> 01:07:53.264]  I know the government's openly announced they're getting rid of our borders and all our sovereignty, and they're going to accept all foreign illegal ID cards, and we'll have no citizenship anymore, but in a global system.
[01:07:54.833 --> 01:07:56.755]  Again, this is the type of radical stuff we're into.
[01:07:56.815 --> 01:08:01.579]  We pick the newspaper up and read the headline and don't like it.
[01:08:02.219 --> 01:08:04.421]  Like this one, the Washington Times today.
[01:08:05.041 --> 01:08:05.322]  U.S.
[01:08:05.442 --> 01:08:06.883]  offers a report to U.N.
[01:08:07.163 --> 01:08:07.964]  on Iraq.
[01:08:08.524 --> 01:08:20.774]  Secretary of State Colin L. Powell yesterday started a major diplomatic effort to institutionalize peacekeeping and internationalize peacekeeping of Iraq, circulating a resolution that would have the U.S.
[01:08:20.814 --> 01:08:23.216]  military reporting to the United Nations.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.704]  Now, they do something.
[01:08:26.724 --> 01:08:27.445]  They have a tactic.
[01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:30.491]  Long before the war, they said, we'll be there five years.
[01:08:30.571 --> 01:08:34.478]  Official number, official policy, official contracts with Halliburton and others.
[01:08:36.084 --> 01:08:42.527]  Then they announced to everyone on the big news, you know, the policy report says five years, we read the policy report, it's in a few papers.
[01:08:42.887 --> 01:08:47.910]  The big news says we'll just be there a few months, ha ha ha, we'll have an election, the Iraqis will love it, milk and honey.
[01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:57.915]  The real report by the government said mass carnage, death, total enslavement, there'll never be elections, five years of our troops, then a dictatorship set up, run by the oil companies, administered by the CIA.
[01:08:58.395 --> 01:09:00.096]  That was the official statement before the war.
[01:09:01.474 --> 01:09:04.116]  People say, Alex, how did you know they claim five years?
[01:09:04.236 --> 01:09:05.577]  What are you, a government agent?
[01:09:05.617 --> 01:09:06.878]  What's your inside scoop?
[01:09:06.918 --> 01:09:10.521]  Well, I don't just sit here and rant every day, day, morning, noon, and night.
[01:09:11.962 --> 01:09:16.405]  I, you know, spend a lot of hours every morning, every night, reading their own policies, PNAC and others.
[01:09:17.986 --> 01:09:22.550]  And so I told you a long time ago the UN would take over Iraq in six months to a year.
[01:09:23.556 --> 01:09:34.064]  After they posed as the good guys against the war, and after there was a fake chicken fight, a carnival barker fight, uh, between, uh, the UN and the US.
[01:09:34.104 --> 01:09:48.295]  You know, this is the old scam where you see the fight, the woman being beat on by a man in a parking lot, you run over, she's real good looking, you say, back off, buddy, he acts cowardly, runs away, and then, you know, you take her home and you wake up in the morning with your throat slit and everything taken.
[01:09:50.116 --> 01:09:51.277]  Your bank account's drained.
[01:09:51.317 --> 01:09:52.118]  You wake up dead.
[01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:53.991]  Well, that's all this is.
[01:09:54.051 --> 01:09:55.051]  You know, the U.S.
[01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:58.213]  is the tool of the globalist, and when they're done, the U.N.
[01:09:58.253 --> 01:09:59.453]  flutters down as the savior.
[01:10:01.354 --> 01:10:01.914]  The U.S.
[01:10:02.034 --> 01:10:16.981]  will remain the commander of the Unified Command, Mr. Powell told reporters in the State Department, and there will be an element in the resolution that calls upon the United States, as the leader of the military coalition, to report on a regular basis to the United Nations, Mr. Powell said, in an effort to bring the U.N.
[01:10:17.001 --> 01:10:18.162]  Security Council into the game.
[01:10:19.045 --> 01:10:20.486]  Well, it's unrelated to mounting U.S.
[01:10:20.506 --> 01:10:21.527]  casualties in Iraq.
[01:10:21.787 --> 01:10:25.750]  In recent weeks, the death toll has sparked calls for Democrats for greater U.N.
[01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:26.831]  control over Iraq.
[01:10:27.651 --> 01:10:33.456]  Man, and you know, it's all over the world news that the depleted uranium level is 1,900 times the safe level.
[01:10:36.559 --> 01:10:39.661]  And the troops are getting lesions and bleeding gums and all the good stuff.
[01:10:40.241 --> 01:10:44.804]  So yeah, I'm over pulling our troops out and sending the Pakistanis and others in there.
[01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:49.687]  I feel sorry for them too, but I have to admit I do care about our troops more than I do about Pakistanis.
[01:10:50.147 --> 01:10:54.910]  Even if our troops have been trained to take our guns and gotten a lot of good practice in Serbia and Iraq.
[01:10:56.191 --> 01:11:01.534]  France and Germany continuing the Carnival Barker Act, are skeptical of U.S.
[01:11:01.574 --> 01:11:02.215]  resolution.
[01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:08.204]  French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Erhard Schroeder discussed the U.S.
[01:11:09.044 --> 01:11:12.826]  proposal at a meeting in the German city of Dresden.
[01:11:12.926 --> 01:11:24.092]  Schroeder, who the government has not yet seen any of the details of the United States plan, said that from what he knows at this point it doesn't go far enough to let the United Nations and the Reconstruction.
[01:11:24.912 --> 01:11:29.555]  Now again, France and Germany are run by the banks.
[01:11:29.735 --> 01:11:31.176]  They're run by the OECD.
[01:11:33.072 --> 01:11:34.853]  The Organization of Development.
[01:11:35.794 --> 01:11:36.514]  They're total puppets.
[01:11:36.534 --> 01:11:38.415]  They're just playing a part to set peace.
[01:11:38.435 --> 01:11:39.616]  Same thing with Japan, all of them.
[01:11:39.636 --> 01:11:40.176]  Total joke.
[01:11:41.557 --> 01:12:00.948]  Several articles in the Sacramento paper and other papers, some of the law journals out there, voting machines call home, and this is up on the websites InfoWars and Prison Planet, and it says the San Luis Obispo County
[01:12:02.831 --> 01:12:06.174]  And it gets into what we covered a few days ago with our voting expert.
[01:12:06.254 --> 01:12:07.915]  What happened at 3.31 p.m.
[01:12:07.975 --> 01:12:11.919]  on Election Day in San Luis Obispo County, California.
[01:12:11.999 --> 01:12:25.010]  A file from the Diebold stash examined by computer and voting activist Jim March, Balameda County, California, turns out to be from a real election that contains real votes.
[01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:28.072]  It also contains a real problem for Diebold.
[01:12:29.542 --> 01:12:29.702]  Ha!
[01:12:30.143 --> 01:12:31.904]  You can read where they were in there.
[01:12:32.224 --> 01:12:34.806]  They're not supposed to touch it, run the machines, nothing.
[01:12:35.086 --> 01:12:39.050]  But there they were, remotely, during the election, wirelessly accessing it.
[01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:42.472]  Of course, they wouldn't let anybody know that all these systems have wireless systems built in.
[01:12:42.492 --> 01:12:44.714]  It's not proprietary, and you can't know.
[01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:50.419]  It turns out, again, the CIA is involved running it, and the corporate minutes of that have now been recorded.
[01:12:51.224 --> 01:13:00.451]  And they, you know, have this so-called classified teleconference with the federal election people, state election people, the lobbyists trying to sell the machines.
[01:13:01.652 --> 01:13:04.434]  I mean, it's so horrible, I could talk for a hundred hours about it!
[01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:07.356]  That's just one of the articles.
[01:13:09.898 --> 01:13:19.345]  And this is back from, this just surfaced, because there's so much of this stuff floating around on these company websites that their idiot employees end up leaving in areas that can be accessed.
[01:13:20.054 --> 01:13:24.980]  The file is from the 2002 primary election in San Luis Obispo, California.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.161]  It is dated March 5, 2002.
[01:13:26.421 --> 01:13:28.143]  It is dated, a time stamp.
[01:13:28.183 --> 01:13:31.727]  It contains an integral audit log which confirms the date and time.
[01:13:32.068 --> 01:13:35.532]  It was saved as a backup file at exactly 3.31 p.m.
[01:13:35.552 --> 01:13:36.493]  on election day.
[01:13:36.773 --> 01:13:38.495]  About five hours before polls closed.
[01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:43.078]  They were loading in the results of the election exactly as they occurred.
[01:13:44.078 --> 01:13:50.002]  The file contains a tabulation taken for 57 precincts.
[01:13:50.042 --> 01:13:50.863]  Can't talk now.
[01:13:51.263 --> 01:13:59.549]  The votes in the file correspond with the final vote tally, which can be found on the San Luis Obispo County website for the election.
[01:13:59.849 --> 01:14:03.391]  But only about 40% of the votes had come by 3.31 in the afternoon.
[01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:11.983]  The file was put on the Diebold FTP site used by Diebold or Diebold employees to transfer files.
[01:14:12.484 --> 01:14:15.626]  Why is it against the law to count votes before the polls close?
[01:14:16.607 --> 01:14:16.967]  That's right.
[01:14:18.668 --> 01:14:20.450]  And it goes, was the file used for training?
[01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:34.220]  It goes on, no one trains poll workers during election day and why would you use real votes and real files during the middle of the election for training when on top of it the company is not supposed to have access to it, much less in real time?
[01:14:34.818 --> 01:14:37.779]  Did they set the date forward for a logic and accuracy test?
[01:14:38.139 --> 01:14:42.720]  The audit log shows that this was an election, not a test.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.481]  When the L and A test is done, the machine has set the test to mode.
[01:14:46.741 --> 01:14:49.022]  The audit log reflects the test mode.
[01:14:50.302 --> 01:14:51.423]  Maybe the clock was off.
[01:14:51.563 --> 01:14:52.923]  It was for a different time zone.
[01:14:53.223 --> 01:14:54.503]  When it said 3.31, it was 8.31.
[01:14:55.744 --> 01:15:03.946]  Checking the date and the clock in part of the election procedures marked important, but more than that are the polls closed there
[01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:05.711]  Or more votes.
[01:15:05.911 --> 01:15:13.496]  About 180 F-registered votes had cast votes as of 3.31 p.m., but the final number, the primary, was at about 35%.
[01:15:13.556 --> 01:15:18.700]  Therefore, the 3.31 vote probably was taken partway through the election.
[01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:26.566]  And it goes on for page after page after page after page, documenting they were in there manipulating the votes.
[01:15:28.047 --> 01:15:32.690]  And again, I have right here in front of me the Plain Dealer of Cleveland, Ohio, reporting the same thing.
[01:15:35.178 --> 01:15:43.305]  And secret meetings about how to use the military-industrial complex for ad campaigns, to sell touch screens, to lobby Washington with their money.
[01:15:43.806 --> 01:15:58.518]  Why are the people, why is the military, the CIA, and private defense contractors involved in selling electronic voting, in maintaining it, in running it, in lobbying for it, and for running ad campaigns?
[01:15:59.579 --> 01:16:03.002]  I mean, this is, this is, this is third world dictatorship, folks!
[01:16:04.736 --> 01:16:06.017]  It's right out in front of you!
[01:16:06.097 --> 01:16:07.098]  Right out in front of you!
[01:16:07.118 --> 01:16:28.776]  I'm going to come back and get into Victory Act, which would be no victory for the public, and then we'll go to Wesley, and Regina, and Renee, and Billy Bob, and everybody else, and get into abortion, Dr. Killers executed in Florida, again abortion, Dr. Killers executed in Florida, Russians to go into Baghdad with the UN, and just all the rest of it.
[01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:33.176]  Coming up, you better turn over the stones, folks.
[01:16:33.616 --> 01:16:34.797]  You better look under the rocks.
[01:16:34.817 --> 01:16:38.640]  You better get hot over these issues, or you're going to lose your freedoms.
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:39.641]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:42.279 --> 01:16:46.904]  Have you been tricked into believing that you can't hire or be hired without a social security number?
[01:16:47.084 --> 01:16:53.030]  You think that you can't bank, get a driver's license, or rent an apartment, or get insurance without a social security number?
[01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:56.073]  It seems everywhere you turn, somebody is asking for it.
[01:16:56.233 --> 01:17:03.600]  But did you know there is no law requiring you to obtain, have, or use a social security number to live or work in the United States?
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:12.270]  The Social Security Number Not Required Policy Manual from Nonumber.com tells you how to assert your rights and live free as an unenumerated American.
[01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:15.694]  Go online at Nonumber.com or call 1-800-831-6141 and order
[01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:19.118]  I think so.
[01:17:36.578 --> 01:17:40.299]  Visit NoNumber.com or call 1-800-831-6141.
[01:17:40.539 --> 01:17:45.201]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:17:45.341 --> 01:17:49.562]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:17:49.823 --> 01:17:52.704]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:17:52.884 --> 01:17:55.304]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:17:55.504 --> 01:18:04.227]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:18:04.428 --> 01:18:05.768]  The Brookie Lite is different.
[01:18:06.008 --> 01:18:12.553]  Water molecules take five to ten minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:18:12.834 --> 01:18:24.883]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:18:25.123 --> 01:18:31.766]  It is so powerful, it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[01:18:34.947 --> 01:18:35.788]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:42.831]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:18:42.911 --> 01:18:47.694]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:18:47.854 --> 01:18:55.678]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:18:55.938 --> 01:19:01.302]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:19:01.502 --> 01:19:08.486]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:14.107]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:19:14.367 --> 01:19:19.109]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:19:19.449 --> 01:19:27.070]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:32.872]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:19:33.952 --> 01:19:37.093]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:37.813 --> 01:19:40.074]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:20:42.569 --> 01:20:55.958]  Alright folks, we're back live.
[01:20:55.978 --> 01:21:06.905]  Let me read this Casper Star Tribune article and then we'll go to Leslie and Renee and Michael and Jack and many others.
[01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:13.312]  I'm going to try to not speed up too fast because I'm not a quick news reader.
[01:21:13.432 --> 01:21:15.433]  I don't like covering stuff too quickly.
[01:21:15.633 --> 01:21:23.696]  There's so much information, so many details, so many facets that I end up getting too sped up and I sound like a guy with a mouth full of marbles.
[01:21:25.238 --> 01:21:27.739]  Victory Act would be no victory for the public.
[01:21:28.119 --> 01:21:42.223]  I rarely read whole news articles written by other people, but this article by Charles Lewandowski, Star Tribune staff writer, is in the new Police State section of Infowars.com.
[01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:53.267]  What we've done is, instead of it being one big front page every day, we put stuff in little sub-sections so you can go read the news of the day there, so the site loads faster for folks that are on dial-ups
[01:21:54.537 --> 01:21:57.240]  Victory Act would be no victory for public.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:12.174]  On August 6th, reporter James Gordon Meek of the New York Daily News scooped a story revealing that Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican Utah, plans to introduce legislation in September to further expand federal police powers.
[01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:19.101]  The Hatch bill, entitled the Victory Act, Vital Interdiction of Criminal Terrorist Organizations Act,
[01:22:19.742 --> 01:22:26.026]  is seen by some to be a substitute for earlier proposed so-called Patriot Act 2.
[01:22:26.766 --> 01:22:35.111]  The Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003 which was leaked and caused a furor in Congress as well as among liberal and conservative civil liberties groups.
[01:22:35.531 --> 01:22:42.295]  A draft copy of the Victory Act dated June 27th has been posted at the website libertythink.com.
[01:22:42.335 --> 01:22:48.438]  We also have it posted in the police state section of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com in the document section.
[01:22:49.511 --> 01:22:50.172]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[01:22:50.212 --> 01:22:59.868]  Attorney General John Ashcroft is stomping around the country to generate support for the draconian USA Patriot Act 2001 at the public's expense.
[01:23:00.894 --> 01:23:08.079]  Taxpayers are paying for Ashcroft to tell them, you're not really losing your liberties and besides, we need those powers against terrorists.
[01:23:08.559 --> 01:23:14.083]  Ashcroft will be trying to sell audiences on granting the federal government even greater law enforcement authority.
[01:23:14.664 --> 01:23:20.708]  Once the cover was blown on the Patriot Act II, Ashcroft and members of the Department of Justice backed away from it.
[01:23:20.988 --> 01:23:24.931]  For months before the text of the Domestic Security Enhancement Act was made public,
[01:23:25.351 --> 01:23:35.096]  Justice Department officials were telling Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat Vermont, the ranking Democrat member of the Senate History Committee, the department was not drafting another anti-terrorism bill.
[01:23:35.756 --> 01:23:39.718]  Here's where Charles Lewandowski is wrong.
[01:23:40.178 --> 01:23:47.982]  Charles, it was introduced in September 7th, excuse me, it was introduced on January 7th of 2003.
[01:23:48.482 --> 01:23:52.844]  Patriot Act 2 is S-22 in the Senate, Domestic Security Enhancement Act,
[01:23:54.617 --> 01:23:57.382]  In the House as Security Enhancement Act.
[01:23:58.083 --> 01:23:58.383]  Okay?
[01:23:58.824 --> 01:23:59.344]  Enrolled.
[01:24:00.246 --> 01:24:01.408]  Legislative control member.
[01:24:01.808 --> 01:24:05.714]  And then he testified that it didn't exist as it was introduced before the House and Senate.
[01:24:05.734 --> 01:24:07.677]  And that's in Police State 3 huddle enslavement.
[01:24:08.017 --> 01:24:10.261]  Ashcroft saying it doesn't exist after it's introduced by him.
[01:24:11.038 --> 01:24:19.328]  The Draconian Patriot Act, too, would have empowered the federal government to conduct secret arrests, collect DNA samples from anyone suspected of terrorism.
[01:24:19.628 --> 01:24:21.170]  Remember, terrorism is any criminal act.
[01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:25.996]  And allow the government to take away an American citizenship, and I would add, ship you to a camp.
[01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:30.801]  Despite its comforting title, the June 27th,
[01:24:32.385 --> 01:24:38.710]  89-page draft of the Victory Act does contain provisions similar to some found in the Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:44.034]  Section 101 of the Victory Act creates a new category of crime called narco-terrorism.
[01:24:44.435 --> 01:24:48.818]  A narco-terrorist would be anyone who possesses even the smallest amount of an illegal drug.
[01:24:48.838 --> 01:24:55.103]  And as dry as one marijuana cigarette, folks, they can walk you out and blow your head off.
[01:24:55.603 --> 01:24:56.504]  That's your new America.
[01:24:57.344 --> 01:25:00.486]  With or without the drug dealer's knowledge that it's connected to terrorism.
[01:25:00.526 --> 01:25:08.310]  Well, any action that's in violation of any law, of any federal or state law, folks, is punishable by having your throats slit, okay?
[01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:09.230]  By a bunch of goons.
[01:25:10.111 --> 01:25:10.971]  It's in there, okay?
[01:25:11.291 --> 01:25:17.915]  The Section 103 of the Act increases the criminal penalties for those convicted of narco-terrorism and other drug-related crimes.
[01:25:17.975 --> 01:25:19.455]  Yeah, 20 to life.
[01:25:20.696 --> 01:25:22.277]  Or, there's other provisions for execution.
[01:25:22.865 --> 01:25:32.051]  Section 201 prohibits money exchanges through a money transfer system based on trust called a Hawala.
[01:25:32.531 --> 01:25:35.373]  The bill calls Hawalas the crime of money laundering.
[01:25:35.913 --> 01:25:40.936]  Hawalas have been used throughout the world for centuries in small rural communities where banks don't exist.
[01:25:40.956 --> 01:25:46.399]  For instance, Hawalas are used by immigrants in Canada to transfer money to relatives in their home countries.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.100]  It's worse than that, sir.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:48.961]  I've read the bill.
[01:25:50.109 --> 01:25:52.590]  Paying cash for anything over $1,000 in Hawala.
[01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:54.931]  Okay?
[01:25:56.291 --> 01:25:58.692]  Putting together a pot, say, for gambling.
[01:25:59.072 --> 01:26:00.893]  Who's going to shoot the biggest deer at the deer camp?
[01:26:01.293 --> 01:26:02.153]  A Hawala.
[01:26:03.154 --> 01:26:04.794]  Everything's a Hawala!
[01:26:06.035 --> 01:26:06.435]  Okay?
[01:26:07.581 --> 01:26:12.262]  And then there's no... It's no your customer legislation, no privacy in banking.
[01:26:12.482 --> 01:26:14.462]  And by the way, that's already all in Patriot Act 1.
[01:26:14.803 --> 01:26:19.504]  Really, this just duplicates Patriot Act 1, takes some of the provisions of Patriot Act 2, and adds them.
[01:26:20.044 --> 01:26:22.844]  It's either repealing stuff in Patriot Act 1, or trying to.
[01:26:22.864 --> 01:26:24.565]  The House has passed it, the Senate won't.
[01:26:25.085 --> 01:26:28.005]  So now they're just firing more torpedoes, basically.
[01:26:28.785 --> 01:26:29.786]  It's just more of the same.
[01:26:29.806 --> 01:26:30.506]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:32.706 --> 01:26:33.627]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.087 --> 01:26:35.607]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:39.369]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:49.112]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:26:49.572 --> 01:26:54.434]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy... ...distribution in the U.S.
[01:26:54.474 --> 01:26:54.914]  market only.
[01:26:55.074 --> 01:26:55.974]  LFI UAC 15174007.
[01:26:56.254 --> 01:26:59.555]  These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[01:26:59.575 --> 01:27:01.936]  These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[01:27:04.438 --> 01:27:07.179]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:27:07.199 --> 01:27:11.121]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:13.922 --> 01:27:14.662]  Well, I did it again.
[01:27:14.682 --> 01:27:17.383]  I started hyperventilating, trying to warn you of all the lies.
[01:27:18.163 --> 01:27:22.185]  Here's the Casper, Wyoming, statewide newspaper, Casper Tribune.
[01:27:23.225 --> 01:27:24.046]  Star Tribune.
[01:27:24.866 --> 01:27:27.947]  Section 202 makes it a crime to conceal more than $10,000 on one's person.
[01:27:30.649 --> 01:27:38.455]  Or in any private or commercial vehicle with the intent to transport that money across state lines or out of the United States.
[01:27:38.495 --> 01:27:40.837]  Depositing in a national bank does that.
[01:27:41.338 --> 01:27:50.265]  If that money was gained in an illegal activity or is intended to be used to promote some form of unlawful activity, this newly created crime is called reverse money laundering.
[01:27:51.145 --> 01:27:54.388]  And that's as a person arrested for transporting funds, reverse money laundering.
[01:27:55.285 --> 01:27:58.547]  We'll forfeit the money upon arrest, even if no charges are filed.
[01:27:58.887 --> 01:28:08.333]  The Hatch Bill not only expands the asset forger powers of the federal government, just what we need, it expands the definition of money laundering to include offshore banking as a means of tax evasion.
[01:28:08.353 --> 01:28:10.294]  Of course, that'll all be selectively enforced.
[01:28:10.314 --> 01:28:12.515]  If you're Enron or Halliburton, you can do no wrong.
[01:28:13.876 --> 01:28:18.899]  A person arrested for transporting funds, again, to the Euro will get in a bunch of trouble.
[01:28:19.887 --> 01:28:27.591]  The Money Laundering Sections of the Victory Act also extend to the authority of the federal law enforcement officials to issue non-judicial or administrative subpoenas.
[01:28:27.651 --> 01:28:31.233]  Yeah, just magic courts out of the FBI that don't even exist.
[01:28:31.253 --> 01:28:34.675]  They're going to make FBI agents judge and jury and executioner now.
[01:28:35.456 --> 01:28:36.256]  Oh, they are in Russia.
[01:28:36.276 --> 01:28:36.977]  What's wrong with it here?
[01:28:37.577 --> 01:28:38.758]  The Money Laundering Sections.
[01:28:39.827 --> 01:28:41.129]  And again, it's for all crimes.
[01:28:59.312 --> 01:29:03.734]  In the Washington Times article, Patriot Act cast a wide net was the headline.
[01:29:03.934 --> 01:29:11.298]  The Justice Department said in open court that all crimes, all misdemeanors, all citizens will be targeted using all of this!
[01:29:11.939 --> 01:29:13.399]  Has nothing to do with terror!
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:19.322]  But at the same time, that's intensifying to Congress when they're on the news.
[01:29:19.382 --> 01:29:20.403]  It doesn't affect you.
[01:29:20.483 --> 01:29:21.523]  It's insane.
[01:29:21.563 --> 01:29:22.464]  No one ever said it.
[01:29:22.484 --> 01:29:24.205]  You better pass or the terrorists will get you.
[01:29:25.842 --> 01:29:30.505]  Finally, Section 505 of the Victory Act expands the government's authority to intercept communications.
[01:29:30.885 --> 01:29:40.892]  Under this bill, a federal district judge could authorize a roving wiretap, that's a blank check for whole regions of the country, to track a person's wireless communications, including cell phones and laptop communications.
[01:29:41.993 --> 01:29:46.075]  The ironically named Victory Act would not be a victory for freedom-loving people.
[01:29:46.415 --> 01:29:50.178]  It is really a wish list for those who want more federal police power.
[01:29:52.364 --> 01:29:59.547]  And it says the final sections of the Hatch Bill limit when unlawfully obtained evidence from wire or oral communications can be thrown out of court.
[01:30:00.627 --> 01:30:15.772]  And of course, just like Patriot Act 2 and 1 gives total anonymity and liability protection to federal forces, such evidence can only be suppressed according to the bill if it violated, involved bad faith by law enforcement, meaning a defendant has to prove the federal police intentionally broke the law.
[01:30:17.253 --> 01:30:17.473]  So,
[01:30:18.337 --> 01:30:20.999]  Creates a whole new class of administrative subpoenas.
[01:30:21.219 --> 01:30:30.785]  Which, by the way, is in Patriot Act 1, so... I mean, they just... guys pull up, they chase you down, throw you in a white van, you're never seen again.
[01:30:33.407 --> 01:30:47.076]  If you got $1,000 in a transfer of cash, or $10,000 in a bank transfer, and that's your new America, folks, but... Yeah, I guess it's a good thing, after all, isn't it?
[01:30:48.181 --> 01:30:49.621]  Ashcroft says so.
[01:30:50.141 --> 01:30:52.002]  Let's go back to the calls and we'll go back into the news.
[01:30:52.522 --> 01:30:54.522]  Let's go to these calls quickly because I want to get to everybody.
[01:30:54.883 --> 01:30:56.443]  Wesley in Tennessee, go ahead.
[01:30:56.463 --> 01:30:58.503]  Hi Alex, how are you this afternoon?
[01:30:58.523 --> 01:30:58.823]  Fine.
[01:30:59.664 --> 01:31:07.005]  I just wanted to say that I truly hope that the fire that burns within your belly for the truth will always burn brightly.
[01:31:07.965 --> 01:31:09.406]  And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
[01:31:09.586 --> 01:31:14.947]  Well, you know, I'm kind of a weirdo Wesley when I read the mainstream news saying, yeah,
[01:31:15.754 --> 01:31:33.046]  Private groups controlled by the CIA are accessing the votes while they're being made, and there's a secret wireless system into the touchscreens, and... Well, uh... Yeah, you know, there's not really an election anymore, but let's move on and talk about the football player who made a B-minus on his grade.
[01:31:33.346 --> 01:31:34.267]  That's more important.
[01:31:34.727 --> 01:31:39.951]  I mean, I guess we're weird, because we're upset about them publicly admitting they're taking our right to vote away.
[01:31:41.112 --> 01:31:45.914]  Well, if it makes this weird, I'm glad to be part of the group, and all I can say is God bless.
[01:31:46.094 --> 01:32:09.203]  Now, my point for today is, if the guy that was executed yesterday for murdering that abortion doctor had been in the parking lot, and the doctor was standing in the parking lot with a two year old little girl, let's say, with a gun to her head,
[01:32:10.714 --> 01:32:12.495]  And he blew the head off that doctor.
[01:32:12.515 --> 01:32:21.520]  Instead of his being executed, we see him with the chief of police, the mayor, he'd be on every talk show.
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:37.948]  Well, all the time, girls at 8 months, all the time girls at 8 months, at their public government training, pregnation and drugging camp, where they learn how to be gang members, they have a baby, they throw it in the trash can, and they get, you know, 20 years in prison.
[01:32:38.670 --> 01:33:01.186]  So this is the new America, you're absolutely right, and Ashcroft is now moving and arguing that people not be allowed to protest at abortion clinics, and continuing that it's racketeering, agreeing with Janet Reno, as he does on every issue, and actually expands every Reno policy, because he's a good neocon, and all I can say is this, I mean I've heard the so-called conservatives decrying this guy that shot the abortion
[01:33:03.934 --> 01:33:04.655]  Technician.
[01:33:05.375 --> 01:33:12.923]  And all I can say is that, you know, Joseph Mingla conducted abortions on pregnant women.
[01:33:13.743 --> 01:33:17.247]  Now, again, I guess Joseph Mingla was good then.
[01:33:18.268 --> 01:33:23.312]  I mean, we have to come to that point and say Joseph Mingla was for eugenics, Margaret Singer was.
[01:33:23.372 --> 01:33:23.913]  She's good.
[01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:26.960]  You know, our government says she's good.
[01:33:27.901 --> 01:33:30.082]  It's the sick double standard.
[01:33:30.362 --> 01:33:32.764]  I was just going to say, it really is our well even.
[01:33:32.904 --> 01:33:34.465]  Double speak and double think.
[01:33:34.485 --> 01:33:37.086]  You know, love is hate, war is peace.
[01:33:37.387 --> 01:33:40.849]  It's just really been turned upside down and inside out.
[01:33:41.369 --> 01:33:46.652]  Well, you see millions of people, 50 plus million people, have carried out abortions.
[01:33:46.672 --> 01:33:49.894]  So that's quite a voting bloc that doesn't want to admit that they were wrong.
[01:33:51.112 --> 01:33:54.956]  That doesn't want to say that a baby in the womb is a human being.
[01:33:55.977 --> 01:33:58.319]  And so that's what you get.
[01:33:58.419 --> 01:34:00.180]  We've become an evil society.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:01.201]  The evil's taking over.
[01:34:01.501 --> 01:34:02.903]  And now they're taking our right to vote.
[01:34:02.923 --> 01:34:03.843]  They're taking our borders.
[01:34:04.144 --> 01:34:05.105]  They're taking our guns.
[01:34:05.145 --> 01:34:06.085]  They're taking our kids.
[01:34:06.446 --> 01:34:07.306]  They're taking everything.
[01:34:07.947 --> 01:34:11.950]  Well, once women start to have chickens, then maybe I'll change my position on abortion.
[01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:17.115]  But until that time, I have to consider that little
[01:34:17.808 --> 01:34:19.690]  I mean, we told everybody, now it's euthanasia.
[01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:21.572]  There's a big report out.
[01:34:21.592 --> 01:34:23.013]  There's people all over the country.
[01:34:23.033 --> 01:34:25.295]  We've had Wesley Smith on from the Wall Street Journal, Wesley.
[01:34:41.210 --> 01:34:43.292]  And, uh, they've got the names.
[01:34:43.552 --> 01:34:46.935]  We're getting a family on with a woman who talks and smiles.
[01:34:47.215 --> 01:34:48.897]  They're going to turn her feeding tube off.
[01:34:49.477 --> 01:34:55.502]  I mean, they're people begging, feed me, feed me, and they're killing them, and the Wall Street Journal lists their names.
[01:34:55.782 --> 01:34:57.944]  That's how crazy it's gotten, buddy.
[01:34:59.185 --> 01:35:03.849]  But the average yuppie has no idea, but they know all about the sports scores.
[01:35:03.889 --> 01:35:04.590]  Thanks for the call.
[01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:05.350]  Thank you.
[01:35:05.951 --> 01:35:07.132]  It is mentally ill.
[01:35:07.893 --> 01:35:22.222]  To tune in and hear people getting so concerned, I tell you, it's wrong that they're posting this young man's scores in high school, that he's not eligible, and I tell you, the team's in a lot of trouble.
[01:35:22.762 --> 01:35:37.371]  Callers call in, they're so concerned, they feel so manly to talk about the team, and they wear their little t-shirts, and they go to the little game while their daughter's at home snorting cocaine with a gang member about to be pregnant.
[01:35:40.057 --> 01:35:40.858]  I mean, think about it.
[01:35:40.878 --> 01:35:44.040]  It's not that the football and the baseball is bad in and of itself.
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:48.123]  It's that that's the religion and people know all the details of it.
[01:35:48.283 --> 01:35:50.704]  But they'll go, uh, politics?
[01:35:50.865 --> 01:35:52.366]  Boat machines are frauds?
[01:35:52.506 --> 01:35:53.506]  I don't want to hear it!
[01:35:53.606 --> 01:35:55.468]  I don't vote know-how!
[01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:00.911]  Or they tell me, there ain't nothing wrong.
[01:36:00.931 --> 01:36:02.473]  We got George Bush in there.
[01:36:04.374 --> 01:36:05.835]  I'm just sick of you, Mr. Jones.
[01:36:06.554 --> 01:36:10.096]  I believe in George W. I was a Democrat, but I'm voting for him.
[01:36:11.376 --> 01:36:14.577]  Surprisingly, there's a lot of Democrats that support this president.
[01:36:14.597 --> 01:36:15.358]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:36:15.998 --> 01:36:17.519]  The ones that know what they're getting.
[01:36:17.859 --> 01:36:19.419]  Total destruction of America.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:23.241]  Total destruction of America.
[01:36:23.681 --> 01:36:25.002]  Now taking place.
[01:36:25.382 --> 01:36:27.443]  The autopsy report on this country.
[01:36:28.203 --> 01:36:31.445]  And by the way, the facade of America is still standing, folks.
[01:36:31.485 --> 01:36:32.365]  You think it's bad now?
[01:36:33.986 --> 01:36:45.197]  There's a big wind of the next New World Order offensive coming, a hundred mile an hour wind, and when it hits this termite-eating structure, you're all going to wish you'd have done something.
[01:36:48.179 --> 01:36:57.328]  But again, when they engineer a depression, you'll be groveling to the government, just put extra creds on my multi-pass card, my ID, and I'll be good.
[01:37:00.718 --> 01:37:02.279]  I'll volunteer.
[01:37:02.319 --> 01:37:09.023]  You've got to volunteer in the Homeland Security Work Brigades to get your creds on your card.
[01:37:09.043 --> 01:37:13.045]  And people say, well, that's not volunteering.
[01:37:13.085 --> 01:37:14.366]  That's compulsory volunteerism.
[01:37:14.626 --> 01:37:19.248]  Well, you've got to work like the rest of us to get creds put on your card after the crash.
[01:37:19.509 --> 01:37:20.409]  That's what they're planning.
[01:37:20.429 --> 01:37:23.711]  Can you imagine what these yuppies will do when their bank accounts are drained?
[01:37:24.847 --> 01:37:26.128]  They're not going to fight with the government.
[01:37:26.148 --> 01:37:27.509]  They're going to worship the government.
[01:37:27.529 --> 01:37:31.212]  They're going to line up to do whatever they've got to to keep the Lexus.
[01:37:34.555 --> 01:37:35.816]  I'll report on my neighbor.
[01:37:35.996 --> 01:37:39.198]  He's got guns and he won't turn them in, these NRA members.
[01:37:39.498 --> 01:37:40.539]  I'll be the first there.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:44.362]  My neighbor's got a gun and I think he's a member of the militia.
[01:37:46.284 --> 01:37:47.865]  He's involved in it.
[01:37:48.165 --> 01:37:48.966]  He's with them.
[01:37:50.505 --> 01:37:55.649]  Now we've got our new world leader who fixed all the problems and he rules from... He's Jesus.
[01:37:55.689 --> 01:37:57.191]  He rules from Jerusalem.
[01:37:58.952 --> 01:38:00.994]  Like the preachers say, he's our leader.
[01:38:01.054 --> 01:38:02.495]  We must swear oath to him.
[01:38:02.555 --> 01:38:07.339]  And because of the terrorist attacking, Pat Robertson said the implantable chip is good.
[01:38:08.079 --> 01:38:09.821]  Jesus says take the chip.
[01:38:10.942 --> 01:38:12.523]  We've got to kill the terrorist.
[01:38:13.003 --> 01:38:15.906]  It's biblical to cut their heads off in mass rallies.
[01:38:17.006 --> 01:38:18.167]  We love Jesus!
[01:38:18.967 --> 01:38:20.448]  Jesus is our world leader!
[01:38:20.468 --> 01:38:23.089]  I mean, that's what they're setting up!
[01:38:23.209 --> 01:38:23.929]  Sounds crazy?
[01:38:24.129 --> 01:38:24.910]  They're doing it!
[01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.950]  They're doing it!
[01:38:26.170 --> 01:38:28.051]  Oh, there's going to be a world leader in Jerusalem!
[01:38:28.251 --> 01:38:30.032]  God will support Israel no matter who's there!
[01:38:30.272 --> 01:38:31.393]  There'll be a leader there!
[01:38:31.513 --> 01:38:33.133]  Soon Jesus will return there!
[01:38:33.774 --> 01:38:35.374]  He'll rule from it!
[01:38:35.914 --> 01:38:37.335]  I mean, folks, it's scary!
[01:38:39.056 --> 01:38:43.658]  Alright, let's talk to
[01:38:45.436 --> 01:38:47.317]  Renee in Alberta, Canada.
[01:38:47.337 --> 01:38:48.618]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:38:48.738 --> 01:38:49.479]  Thank you very much.
[01:38:49.499 --> 01:38:50.320]  I appreciate it.
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:54.723]  Well, my friend, I have an interesting little tidbit here to add.
[01:38:55.163 --> 01:39:01.087]  I received a check, mail, from Visa, because I'm a Visa member.
[01:39:02.148 --> 01:39:04.230]  And the check's for five dollars.
[01:39:04.450 --> 01:39:05.671]  It's a cashless check.
[01:39:05.711 --> 01:39:08.673]  You're instantly enrolled in a great new program.
[01:39:10.074 --> 01:39:12.596]  And this great new program consists of
[01:39:14.036 --> 01:39:19.858]  And it's absolutely obvious that that's being sold, and we already know Visa's doing it, to Homeland Security.
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:49.605]  They want you to give all your bill payments, everything, and you just give them all the information, and they take care of it for you.
[01:39:50.286 --> 01:39:53.928]  In case you ever lose it, that way they have all the information.
[01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:55.189]  You know what?
[01:39:55.269 --> 01:39:56.270]  I got a great plan.
[01:39:57.211 --> 01:40:02.234]  I'm going to buy a thousand acres outside Austin, nice farmland, out towards Bastrop.
[01:40:02.975 --> 01:40:08.879]  And anybody that wants to be my slave can come out to Bastrop,
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:18.388]  And I'll put you in a nice little hut, and I'll have a store that you buy everything from, because you won't have any money, so it'll all be credit.
[01:40:19.469 --> 01:40:22.352]  And you'll work, and then I'll give you food.
[01:40:22.692 --> 01:40:23.893]  I'll just run your life.
[01:40:23.953 --> 01:40:26.976]  And I'll put a chain around your neck, just for your safety.
[01:40:27.036 --> 01:40:27.677]  How's that sound?
[01:40:27.697 --> 01:40:31.100]  Yeah, sounds like what's going to be happening here.
[01:40:31.468 --> 01:40:35.790]  Well, let me tell you what else is going on, and it's even more serious than that.
[01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:41.512]  A lot of private corporations are trying to force people to take automatic cash transfers to their bank accounts.
[01:40:43.332 --> 01:40:45.053]  And then there's a penalty if you refuse.
[01:40:45.073 --> 01:40:50.375]  And now the government's trying to demand payment, not by a mail-in, but by computer.
[01:40:51.161 --> 01:40:55.043]  And a lot of corporations are doing this.
[01:40:55.323 --> 01:40:58.564]  And the Federal Reserve announced four years ago they're going to put RFIDs in all the money.
[01:40:59.085 --> 01:41:08.309]  You'll still have cash, but it'll all be scanned at the point of sale with your name and information put on it to stop money laundering, because that's what aids the terrorists.
[01:41:09.649 --> 01:41:13.011]  Scanned with your name and number imprinted right on the RFID?
[01:41:14.409 --> 01:41:31.945]  Well, yeah, see what'll happen is they'll demand you swipe your ID card, your driver's license, it's really a national ID card, or your, up in Canada, your province card, which is really a standardized national ID card, they've now announced it's really a world ID card, as they unify all the systems.
[01:41:32.725 --> 01:41:34.607]  This has all been publicly announced years ago!
[01:41:35.524 --> 01:41:40.585]  And see, so, then they'll say, well, it has the added thing that we have the new national sales tax, which they're getting ready for.
[01:41:40.605 --> 01:41:42.425]  They're going to keep the income tax, too.
[01:41:42.705 --> 01:41:46.166]  They're going to use mindless, phony conservatives to push for a sales tax.
[01:41:46.306 --> 01:41:58.829]  Then they're going to keep the income tax, have both, and tax you on fast food, sugar drinks, then it'll be beef, chicken, things that aren't healthy, how much ice cream and milk you buy.
[01:41:59.069 --> 01:42:00.929]  That'll be transmitted to the insurance company.
[01:42:01.209 --> 01:42:05.132]  My question is, I would assume there's an opposite opposing force to this takeover
[01:42:30.746 --> 01:42:34.767]  In the upper echelon of Congress or Senate?
[01:42:34.827 --> 01:42:35.047]  No.
[01:42:35.648 --> 01:42:36.528]  I mean, look at it.
[01:42:36.788 --> 01:42:39.709]  Was there an upper echelon opposing in Nazi Germany or Russia?
[01:42:40.249 --> 01:42:43.630]  There might be people fighting with each other, but it's only over who controls the cattle.
[01:42:44.230 --> 01:42:44.550]  Gotcha.
[01:42:44.970 --> 01:42:52.853]  I mean, when a rustler comes up to take somebody's cows, the Illuminati sees it as their cows.
[01:42:53.193 --> 01:42:55.614]  Are there rustlers out there that try to set up their own systems?
[01:42:55.634 --> 01:42:56.034]  Yeah.
[01:42:56.754 --> 01:43:00.415]  And that's what the law enforcement and the FBI is for, is to go after their competition.
[01:43:01.667 --> 01:43:06.391]  A drug cartel starts shipping in a lot of drugs, cutting back on the globalist profit, they send in troops.
[01:43:07.952 --> 01:43:11.615]  I mean, they sent the head of the New York Stock Exchange three years ago publicly to meet with the FARC.
[01:43:12.155 --> 01:43:12.536]  Publicly!
[01:43:12.556 --> 01:43:13.416]  It was in the newspaper.
[01:43:13.437 --> 01:43:14.958]  He said, you better launder your money with us.
[01:43:15.298 --> 01:43:16.879]  They said no, the invasion began.
[01:43:22.163 --> 01:43:23.505]  Alright, well thank you for the call, sir.
[01:43:23.525 --> 01:43:24.225]  Really good points.
[01:43:25.226 --> 01:43:28.769]  Let's talk to Michael in Texas and Jack in Colorado.
[01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:30.190]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:43:31.633 --> 01:43:42.961]  Alex, what's interesting, I've been reading in World Net Daily, New York Times, Houston Chronicle, what's interesting about the year 2005, and I know you can't put dates on it, is that the Free Trade Agreement goes into effect in 2005.
[01:43:43.402 --> 01:43:48.886]  Yeah, and Bush says if you like the economy now, he wants total Pan-American Union, you're gonna love it!
[01:43:49.386 --> 01:43:52.128]  Bush is also talking about establishing a Palestinian state in 2005.
[01:43:54.258 --> 01:43:55.158]  Let's just put it this way.
[01:43:55.178 --> 01:43:57.179]  The next couple of years are going to be real interesting.
[01:44:16.314 --> 01:44:24.585]  It's just interesting, because I know you can't put dates, but these global leaders are putting... Oh, well, they said that the New World Order was five years behind in 2000.
[01:44:24.645 --> 01:44:33.076]  They suspended putting the gold capstone on at the public Illuminati ceremony they had on national TV at the Giza Plateau.
[01:44:33.096 --> 01:44:33.517]  Remember that?
[01:44:34.511 --> 01:44:34.731]  Yeah.
[01:44:34.811 --> 01:44:36.172]  And they didn't put the gold cap on.
[01:44:36.192 --> 01:44:37.233]  They stood up and announced.
[01:44:38.314 --> 01:44:41.736]  A French rock band said, oh, Antichrist, you will come in five years.
[01:44:42.076 --> 01:44:44.438]  Praise you, Anti-Beast, ruler of Earth.
[01:44:44.738 --> 01:44:46.039]  And the world leaders were all there.
[01:44:46.319 --> 01:44:49.541]  And then they were praising Satan in Latin.
[01:44:50.562 --> 01:44:55.565]  I watched this with my mouth hanging open on PBS here locally.
[01:44:55.885 --> 01:44:57.026]  One more thing, Alex, before you go.
[01:44:57.206 --> 01:44:58.107]  But again, I'm radical.
[01:44:58.127 --> 01:45:00.388]  I shouldn't report how they're praising Satan, by the way, on TV.
[01:45:00.608 --> 01:45:01.309]  Sure, stay right there.
[01:45:01.329 --> 01:45:01.689]  We'll be back.
[01:45:04.053 --> 01:45:06.034]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:45:06.114 --> 01:45:16.818]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:45:17.198 --> 01:45:21.740]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:33.124]  When used, water flow through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:45:33.724 --> 01:45:40.567]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:43.107]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:45:43.588 --> 01:45:48.569]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:45:48.869 --> 01:45:55.012]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[01:46:03.238 --> 01:46:08.462]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:46:08.622 --> 01:46:13.066]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[01:46:13.206 --> 01:46:17.610]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:46:17.630 --> 01:46:18.971]  The New World Order.
[01:46:19.691 --> 01:46:20.712]  Panama.
[01:46:20.753 --> 01:46:24.957]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:46:25.037 --> 01:46:31.965]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:46:32.105 --> 01:46:34.108]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:46:34.508 --> 01:46:44.890]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:46:45.090 --> 01:46:50.471]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:53.612]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:46:53.712 --> 01:46:54.872]  Recall toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:46:54.892 --> 01:46:55.332]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:46:55.352 --> 01:46:57.173]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:47:03.729 --> 01:47:06.330]  Hardly a day goes by in the garden without the CobraHead.
[01:47:06.490 --> 01:47:09.371]  I want to tell you about a great little garden tool called the CobraHead.
[01:47:09.551 --> 01:47:15.394]  First, take half of the tools you're currently using in the garden, throw them away, and call 1-866-YO-COBRA.
[01:47:15.554 --> 01:47:17.795]  The CobraHead is like having a steel fingernail.
[01:47:17.955 --> 01:47:25.198]  This tool plants, scalps, cultivates, transplants, defatches, harvests, furrows, digs, you name it, the CobraHead can do it.
[01:47:25.438 --> 01:47:30.920]  With the CobraHead, I can make quick work out of weeding my garden beds, especially between the garden rows where space is tight.
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:33.541]  I love to spend time in the garden as any gardener does.
[01:47:33.541 --> 01:47:36.161]  Yes, but now my time in the garden is a lot more productive.
[01:47:36.381 --> 01:47:42.723]  The CobraHead handheld multi-purpose garden tool has certainly earned my personal stamp of approval and I'd recommend it to anyone.
[01:47:42.923 --> 01:47:44.323]  But don't take my word for it.
[01:47:44.383 --> 01:47:51.644]  The CobraHead just received the recommendation and seal of approval from the National Home Gardening Club after being tested by 200 members.
[01:47:52.104 --> 01:47:53.104]  Don't wait another minute.
[01:47:53.504 --> 01:47:54.965]  Call toll free 1-866-YO-COBRA.
[01:47:55.025 --> 01:47:57.145]  That's 1-866-962-6272 or visit CobraHead.com.
[01:48:08.544 --> 01:48:10.445]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:48:10.945 --> 01:48:13.846]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:15.746 --> 01:48:24.009]  You know, I know this show sounded insane five years ago when I told you there'd be a national move to have every child take a microchip in the name of stopping kidnappings.
[01:48:24.369 --> 01:48:25.869]  You saw that in the last two years.
[01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.710]  Wall to wall.
[01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:27.630]  Every news channel.
[01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:29.671]  Time magazine for kids in the schools.
[01:48:30.371 --> 01:48:36.993]  I know it sounds crazy when I get up here and say that on the 2000 marker, which really wasn't even the new millennium, but that's what they celebrated,
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:53.109]  I was watching, they were going around different parts of the world, and they said, many world leaders have gathered at the pyramids, and it showed giant movie screens projecting some horned demon dancing with some spoken word ban in English from France going, oh, Antichrist!
[01:48:53.530 --> 01:48:54.250]  Antibes!
[01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:55.351]  Destroy them!
[01:48:55.631 --> 01:48:59.093]  Give us power!
[01:48:59.113 --> 01:48:59.093]  2005!
[01:48:59.133 --> 01:49:00.454]  And George Bush Sr.
[01:49:00.494 --> 01:49:00.874]  was there.
[01:49:02.876 --> 01:49:09.262]  You know, it's like the National News showing footage of skull and bones with guys in black hoods going, we slit your throat for Satan!
[01:49:09.282 --> 01:49:11.944]  You know, and Peter Jennings goes, they're just having fun.
[01:49:12.024 --> 01:49:14.446]  I mean, you know, I don't make this stuff up.
[01:49:15.667 --> 01:49:16.728]  It's all off the charts.
[01:49:16.788 --> 01:49:17.849]  It's totally insane.
[01:49:18.089 --> 01:49:19.430]  We're living in la-la land.
[01:49:20.972 --> 01:49:21.572]  It's happening.
[01:49:21.632 --> 01:49:26.917]  I mean, they now admit the touchscreens are run by shadowy CIA front companies with the CIA controlling it.
[01:49:26.937 --> 01:49:28.898]  There's no more election when they're putting them in.
[01:49:28.958 --> 01:49:29.459]  I mean, it's just...
[01:49:31.135 --> 01:49:36.998]  Real quick, Michael in Texas, and we'll go to Jack, Ron, Bill, and others.
[01:49:37.238 --> 01:49:38.999]  Go ahead, Michael, finish up.
[01:49:39.259 --> 01:49:44.702]  Two other interesting points is that you were talking about all these special operations groups going to Iraq.
[01:49:45.362 --> 01:49:55.807]  Well, on MSNBC, back during March, they had what's called MOUT, Military Operations in Urban Terrain, have actually at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, 101st,
[01:49:57.918 --> 01:50:00.440]  Well, actually, I don't know who told you that.
[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:03.522]  There's a bunch of recognized churches and religions that are non-governmental organizations
[01:50:20.003 --> 01:50:23.125]  And they've got a New Age meditation chamber there, but hey, thanks for the call.
[01:50:23.145 --> 01:50:23.846]  Appreciate it.
[01:50:24.206 --> 01:50:26.068]  We've got Jack McClam come up in about 10 minutes.
[01:50:26.108 --> 01:50:32.353]  I'm going to break, and then I promise I'm going to Jack, Ron, and Bill, and then a bunch of other news.
[01:50:32.413 --> 01:50:34.094]  Jack McClam, Police Constituent World Order.
[01:50:34.514 --> 01:50:36.135]  I'm kind of overheating here on the air.
[01:50:36.155 --> 01:50:39.938]  There's so much news and information, but we'll get to the stuff we haven't covered in the next hour.
[01:50:39.958 --> 01:50:41.039]  We've already covered a lot of it.
[01:50:41.379 --> 01:50:43.381]  There's a lot of other important stuff, like experts.
[01:50:43.521 --> 01:50:45.843]  SARS return possible this fall.
[01:50:45.903 --> 01:50:47.024]  More of their fear-mongering.
[01:50:47.691 --> 01:50:50.713]  Just five years for a man who raped a baby in England.
[01:50:51.794 --> 01:50:55.756]  But if you are found owning a gun illegally, you get 20 years in jail.
[01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:57.317]  Or if you defend yourself.
[01:50:57.337 --> 01:50:59.338]  I mean, it shows that criminals run things.
[01:50:59.798 --> 01:51:00.719]  Sickos run things.
[01:51:01.239 --> 01:51:04.101]  Bush touts free trade accords, benefits to American economy.
[01:51:04.401 --> 01:51:05.602]  Yeah, it's been great, hasn't it?
[01:51:05.822 --> 01:51:06.683]  What we need's more.
[01:51:06.703 --> 01:51:09.624]  It's like, you barely survived that cyanide we gave you.
[01:51:09.944 --> 01:51:11.305]  Here, take a gallon of it.
[01:51:11.345 --> 01:51:11.966]  That'll help.
[01:51:13.627 --> 01:51:15.648]  So it's all coming up in the next hour.
[01:51:16.658 --> 01:51:19.379]  With Jack McClam and your calls first before we get Jack on.
[01:51:19.399 --> 01:51:22.960]  Before I end this hour, it's very important for everybody to pay attention to this.
[01:51:25.461 --> 01:51:29.982]  I have written a book, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny, detailing who really carried out September 11th.
[01:51:30.242 --> 01:51:32.083]  It's important that everybody know the truth out there.
[01:51:32.343 --> 01:51:35.024]  It makes a great gift, only $12, 230 pages.
[01:51:35.664 --> 01:51:38.825]  Covers September 11th and the history of the New World Order and government-sponsored terror.
[01:51:39.065 --> 01:51:42.246]  The new book, Order Out of Chaos, by Paul Watson, that we published.
[01:51:42.979 --> 01:51:46.541]  Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order is $19, 300 and something pages.
[01:51:47.001 --> 01:51:49.363]  That's on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:49.823 --> 01:51:52.124]  My new film is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:51:52.565 --> 01:52:01.510]  We have another great film, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, more of what the Christian conservative leaders do when they're behind closed doors, caught on tape.
[01:52:02.273 --> 01:52:04.354]  Now, you need to get these videos.
[01:52:04.374 --> 01:52:05.414]  The videos are $25.95.
[01:52:05.514 --> 01:52:06.174]  Order three or more.
[01:52:06.454 --> 01:52:07.875]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[01:52:08.355 --> 01:52:09.215]  Don't wait!
[01:52:09.796 --> 01:52:16.578]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to check out the new Deception Dollars we carry, the books by Tex Marsch, Fritz Springmeier.

[01:52:19.939 --> 01:52:20.599]  Make the call!
[01:52:20.619 --> 01:52:20.659]  888-253-3139.

[01:52:43.807 --> 01:52:44.448]  Don't wait.

[01:52:47.431 --> 01:52:48.372]  Wake America Up.
[01:52:48.392 --> 01:52:48.432]  888-253-3139.
[01:52:48.552 --> 01:52:49.133]  Third hour, straight ahead.
[01:52:54.022 --> 01:52:57.304]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:52:57.424 --> 01:53:01.667]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:53:01.927 --> 01:53:11.873]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.449 --> 01:53:20.090]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:21.791]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.532 --> 01:53:23.613]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.294 --> 01:53:25.095]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.856 --> 01:53:27.797]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.817 --> 01:53:31.081]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.621 --> 01:53:35.725]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:38.408 --> 01:53:42.873]  Coming up in about eight minutes, we've got Jack McClam.
[01:53:44.369 --> 01:53:50.072]  My favorite guest, police against the New World Order, police and military against the New World Order, Aid in the Bat newsletter.
[01:53:50.992 --> 01:53:57.315]  He's been fighting the Gladys for over 20 years, highly decorated police officer, of course also military veteran.
[01:53:58.555 --> 01:54:03.858]  We'll talk about just the news and how to wake the police and military up and what we're facing right now.
[01:54:05.038 --> 01:54:07.860]  And the specter of government-sponsored terror unfolding.
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:12.722]  Going back to the calls as promised, Jack in Colorado has been holding patiently.
[01:54:12.762 --> 01:54:13.423]  Go ahead, Jack.
[01:54:13.843 --> 01:54:14.663]  Hi, how are you?
[01:54:14.883 --> 01:54:15.504]  Fantastic.
[01:54:16.424 --> 01:54:20.787]  I just wanted to tell you that they're RFID-ing the Euro now.
[01:54:21.507 --> 01:54:29.631]  Yeah, they announced that the Euro note over in the EU is going to have RFID, but I want to tell you, American money's already had it since 1996.
[01:54:29.751 --> 01:54:33.494]  It's just a larger, more primitive RFID.
[01:54:33.934 --> 01:54:34.234]  Oh, really?
[01:54:34.890 --> 01:54:38.071]  And that, again, is the radio frequency identification devices.
[01:54:38.551 --> 01:54:50.855]  Okay, so let me just ask my question really quickly, which is, do you think that they're going to depress the country before, or do you think they'll take the money away first before they depress the country or afterward?
[01:54:51.903 --> 01:55:10.256]  Well, I think that by taking the money supply, by restricting the money supply so we physically can't pay off debts, which is one of their favorite tactics, which they've done many times before in our history, in the last hundred years since the Federal Reserve took over, last 90 years, that's exactly what we're facing.
[01:55:10.296 --> 01:55:12.797]  So, I mean, it's the chicken or the egg, which comes first.
[01:55:13.418 --> 01:55:14.859]  I mean, that's up to your perspective.
[01:55:14.899 --> 01:55:16.640]  But I know Ron Paul, Congressman,
[01:55:17.475 --> 01:55:24.839]  A veteran, a doctor, a veteran congressman with a great track record said we're going to have a depression.
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:32.804]  He said that this weekend here in Austin when I gave a speech there at a large meeting that he attended and gave a speech at.
[01:55:33.645 --> 01:55:33.905]  Okay.
[01:55:34.585 --> 01:55:38.127]  Well, I'll just keep listening to you and hope this doesn't happen.
[01:55:38.788 --> 01:55:39.328]  I hear you.
[01:55:39.868 --> 01:55:40.549]  I got a little
[01:55:42.301 --> 01:55:45.203]  The show's getting a little wild, but the news is crazy.
[01:55:45.223 --> 01:55:46.464]  What did you think of the last hour?
[01:55:46.524 --> 01:55:48.325]  All the wild stuff that's going on.
[01:55:48.946 --> 01:55:49.246]  I know.
[01:55:50.347 --> 01:55:52.988]  Isn't the Powerball the U.S.
[01:55:53.089 --> 01:55:53.449]  tax?
[01:55:53.849 --> 01:55:54.830]  Isn't that the new tax?
[01:55:57.371 --> 01:56:00.715]  That's certainly one of the regional taxes we're facing.
[01:56:00.955 --> 01:56:02.316]  Yeah, wouldn't you consider it that?
[01:56:02.937 --> 01:56:07.782]  Well, I know in 1984 they used lotteries to control the mindless population, thanks for the call.
[01:56:08.503 --> 01:56:10.726]  Everything that's in that book we now have in spades.
[01:56:11.406 --> 01:56:14.970]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in New York.
[01:56:15.010 --> 01:56:15.531]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:56:18.638 --> 01:56:20.439]  Ron's got about a minute and a half here.
[01:56:20.699 --> 01:56:22.100]  It's an excellent show today, Alex.
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:23.421]  Thank you.
[01:56:23.641 --> 01:56:26.563]  The last hour is your attempt, and I feel the same way.
[01:56:27.383 --> 01:56:35.428]  You almost want to grab the people by their lapels and shake them to wake up, because there are all these things going on.
[01:56:36.008 --> 01:56:40.271]  And it's not just that Alex Jones says it, you can verify it.
[01:56:40.791 --> 01:56:47.115]  And I know because I've done my own research, what you're saying on the air is verifiable from official sources.
[01:56:48.359 --> 01:56:54.584]  You mentioned Orrin Hatch, that fine plastic patriot out there in Utah.
[01:56:55.085 --> 01:57:05.333]  Well, the American people ought to know, when this man positions himself as a fine conservative patriot, that he is pushing in the United States Senate for a law called the DREAM Act.
[01:57:06.154 --> 01:57:06.494]  All right?
[01:57:07.054 --> 01:57:16.342]  What the DREAM Act would do is make it even easier than it presently is for illegal aliens to be converted into American citizens and as an added benefit,
[01:57:16.877 --> 01:57:21.539]  They will get superior economical education.
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:24.261]  And he's introduced a bill so Arnold can be president.
[01:57:24.301 --> 01:57:24.681]  That's right.
[01:57:24.741 --> 01:57:25.161]  Part of that.
[01:57:25.381 --> 01:57:29.163]  He's also introduced a bill for the Victory Act.
[01:57:29.704 --> 01:57:30.144]  Uh-huh.
[01:57:30.184 --> 01:57:31.465]  He's part of a lot of mayhem.
[01:57:31.925 --> 01:57:33.506]  But this was just his latest thing.
[01:57:34.086 --> 01:57:34.846]  Did you imagine that?
[01:57:35.327 --> 01:57:36.687]  A non-American citizen.
[01:57:37.188 --> 01:57:40.909]  And he said, because we don't want to waste their talents and their contributions.
[01:57:40.969 --> 01:57:43.791]  But don't waste the talents and contributions of your children.
[01:57:44.372 --> 01:57:46.134]  Don't waste your children, literally.
[01:57:46.174 --> 01:57:50.039]  Bush just signed a new deal where illegal aliens get healthcare but citizens don't.
[01:57:50.419 --> 01:57:50.820]  That's right.
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:51.621]  Did you hear about that?
[01:57:51.821 --> 01:57:53.303]  Yes, yes I have heard about that.
[01:57:53.323 --> 01:57:54.844]  I was going to mention something about that.
[01:57:54.864 --> 01:57:55.746]  I was going to allude to that.
[01:57:56.246 --> 01:57:58.789]  And this is what we're coming to at this stage in time.
[01:57:59.270 --> 01:58:01.653]  This is outrageous and that's why you're
[01:58:02.495 --> 01:58:03.876]  You've gone on the way you are.
[01:58:03.896 --> 01:58:06.496]  We're being inundated with so many abuses.
[01:58:06.757 --> 01:58:07.317]  Exactly!
[01:58:07.357 --> 01:58:08.977]  I just feel like pulling my hair out.
[01:58:09.017 --> 01:58:10.478]  I mean, this is totally insane.
[01:58:10.498 --> 01:58:13.779]  We're under massive, sustained New World Order attack.
[01:58:14.279 --> 01:58:14.899]  I'd like to think.
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:19.301]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:58:19.461 --> 01:58:23.883]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:58:24.043 --> 01:58:28.424]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:58:28.464 --> 01:58:29.825]  The New World Order.
[01:58:31.607 --> 01:58:35.811]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:58:35.891 --> 01:58:42.819]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:58:42.959 --> 01:58:44.962]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:58:45.362 --> 01:58:55.748]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:58:55.948 --> 01:59:01.331]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:00:14.352 --> 02:00:17.835]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:00:18.095 --> 02:00:21.598]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:00:21.678 --> 02:00:25.641]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:00:25.861 --> 02:00:32.026]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:00:32.426 --> 02:00:40.332]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:00:40.752 --> 02:00:46.076]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[02:00:46.236 --> 02:00:49.999]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:00:50.379 --> 02:00:52.281]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[02:00:52.301 --> 02:00:54.483]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[02:01:19.481 --> 02:01:20.142]  Big Brother.
[02:01:20.782 --> 02:01:21.843]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:22.564 --> 02:01:23.725]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:23.745 --> 02:01:25.166]  You want answers?
[02:01:25.186 --> 02:01:26.767]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:27.467 --> 02:01:31.390]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:31.651 --> 02:01:35.714]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:38.675 --> 02:01:43.997]  Alright my friends, welcome back already 8 minutes and 30 seconds into this third and final hour.
[02:01:44.037 --> 02:01:45.358]  It is the 4th of September, 2003.
[02:01:45.818 --> 02:01:59.344]  We've got a bunch of key news articles I want to throw out at our guest, Jack McClam, who for over 20 years has been exposing the criminal activities of the global elite, also known as the New World Order.
[02:02:00.344 --> 02:02:03.625]  And Jack joins us now from his home out west.
[02:02:03.665 --> 02:02:04.506]  I know that we have
[02:02:05.979 --> 02:02:10.742]  A bunch of callers that are patiently holding on a bunch of different subjects concerning the New World Order.
[02:02:10.782 --> 02:02:18.828]  If you'd like to join us on air, we'll take those calls early in this hour at 800-259-9231.
[02:02:19.768 --> 02:02:21.930]  Jack McClam, it's good to have you on the show, my friend.
[02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:22.870]  Hey, brother.
[02:02:22.890 --> 02:02:24.291]  It's good to be back with you, Alex.
[02:02:25.012 --> 02:02:32.217]  I want to take some time out to talk about some of the outreach programs you and Officer Dalton and other great folks have had
[02:02:32.978 --> 02:02:39.721]  To reach out and educate police and military, but first I wanted to throw out a couple of topical news items at you.
[02:02:40.501 --> 02:02:42.422]  The Rodden Family's U.S.
[02:02:42.602 --> 02:02:44.803]  exit approved by the Bush administration
[02:02:45.566 --> 02:02:47.528]  Now, we've been reporting this for almost two years.
[02:02:47.608 --> 02:02:57.655]  We knew this day one that they flew hundreds of Bin Ladens and terrorists out of the country, and now they just calmly announce it like it's no big deal.
[02:02:57.715 --> 02:02:59.596]  Your response to that?
[02:03:02.178 --> 02:03:14.808]  Well, there's so much coming out today, Alex, through programs like yours and just hundreds of publications that are non-establishment publications and other media sources.
[02:03:16.285 --> 02:03:28.132]  I think that when they do these things, they throw it out there so that when it comes out, when these things, if they do come to the fore, that they can say, oh, we told you about that stuff, it's no big deal.
[02:03:28.852 --> 02:03:32.054]  But, of course, you and I know that this is all a game.
[02:03:32.074 --> 02:03:41.739]  It's all a game about terrorism and fear in the minds of the American people, so we will give up our freedoms and become a part of the Bush's world government system.
[02:03:41.979 --> 02:03:43.600]  Well, Jack, I've got a great example of that.
[02:03:44.534 --> 02:03:51.998]  I was talking to Stanley Hilton, Bob Dole's former Chief of Staff, suing the President for $7 million for carrying out September 11th.
[02:03:52.078 --> 02:03:53.859]  Not for prior knowledge, but for being involved.
[02:03:54.199 --> 02:04:05.104]  And he was deposing all these military officers and colonels who were involved in having to train the supposed terrorists and having prior knowledge and NORAD standing down.
[02:04:05.665 --> 02:04:11.888]  And so, right as he reports that on my show and talks about that, suddenly an article comes out in the Associated Press
[02:04:12.719 --> 02:04:27.188]  Well, on September 11th, at 8.30 in the morning, right when the hijackings began, it just so happened the CIA was running a drill of flying hijacked jets into buildings in New York and D.C.
[02:04:27.848 --> 02:04:33.211]  and we couldn't help it and that's why NORAD accidentally stood down that morning, Jack.
[02:04:33.532 --> 02:04:39.455]  Yes, those accidents, they happen and there's not much you can do about it, brother.
[02:04:39.475 --> 02:04:40.596]  It just happened to happen.
[02:04:42.139 --> 02:04:49.044]  Just so happened to happen that the head envoy from the White House, the National Security Council, was running that drill that morning.
[02:04:49.244 --> 02:04:56.210]  That way when all the guys at the Pentagon stand around and go, well, this was a drill this morning, but it really happened, they just go, just a coincidence, boys!
[02:04:56.510 --> 02:05:01.314]  How dumb do they think these officers are, and why haven't we seen more from them?
[02:05:01.334 --> 02:05:01.614]  Tell us.
[02:05:03.095 --> 02:05:05.496]  Well, it's just a matter of conditioning.
[02:05:05.556 --> 02:05:19.619]  You know, when I was an academy instructor in the largest police academy in the southwest part of the United States in Arizona for five years, and I saw the brainwashing that our brothers and sisters in law enforcement go through.
[02:05:19.639 --> 02:05:31.762]  Of course, I'm a military veteran from the Vietnam War and have for 22 years now communicated with our brothers and sisters in spy ops operations in the military and in federal agencies and all.
[02:05:32.423 --> 02:05:38.928]  This is a matter of conditioning to these guys to where they really believe when their government tells us these things.
[02:05:39.008 --> 02:05:41.570]  Many of them say, well, that's the way it is.
[02:05:42.030 --> 02:06:00.224]  You know, they truly, many of them just don't know that they're being, have been brainwashed to where they believe whatever the government tells them to do to the American people or any other people of any nation or any of the information put out like that to mislead them.
[02:06:02.515 --> 02:06:03.316]  Well, absolutely.
[02:06:03.336 --> 02:06:10.520]  Again, we're talking to Jack McClam, police against the New World Order, 20 years fighting the globalists, putting out Aid in the Bat newsletter, Vampire Killer 2000.
[02:06:11.841 --> 02:06:15.624]  Two police and military listening to this show right now.
[02:06:16.804 --> 02:06:21.007]  What do you have to say to them about the system we're in right now and what we're facing in the next two years?
[02:06:22.888 --> 02:06:31.634]  Well, as we say every day in our email to law enforcement and the military people that are contacting us or through our publications,
[02:06:34.399 --> 02:06:37.539]  You know, we are your brothers and sisters here.
[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:46.882]  Somebody, praise God, years ago gave us some information that awakened us to the fact that there is this world conspiracy going on.
[02:06:47.682 --> 02:06:53.023]  We don't have to, as you know Alex, and our law enforcement people don't know out there,
[02:06:56.595 --> 02:07:22.971]  I wonder if this is going on, because we have publications, many publications out there that you've read and I've read, where Prime Ministers, Supreme Court Justices, Presidents of the United States and others have admitted to this system that's set up, and so it's real, but when you hear it from a fellow police officer or soldier through one of our publications,
[02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:33.290]  You will give it some heed, but sadly, when a private citizen comes up to give you that information, you think they're crazy, they're off the deep end.
[02:07:33.751 --> 02:07:36.974]  You've been told that they're probably one of these domestic terrorists out there.
[02:07:37.354 --> 02:07:38.876]  Now, Jack, here's the problem, though.
[02:07:39.116 --> 02:07:42.099]  For twenty-something years you've been doing it, for ten years I've been exposing it.
[02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:46.164]  The cops, the police, the military, they heard us talk about this.
[02:07:46.884 --> 02:07:53.967]  Now, they read USA Today, it says the Supreme Court follows the UN's orders, they're getting rid of the borders, they're coming after the guns.
[02:07:54.487 --> 02:08:02.890]  Now, I've seen our credibility just explode, because all we did was read the documents on the air, now it came true, because we have their own handbooks.
[02:08:03.130 --> 02:08:04.391]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:08:05.051 --> 02:08:09.433]  And so, I think we're going to see more of this coming out, because
[02:08:10.183 --> 02:08:18.147]  They need to do their cover-ups and they've got to come out with the truth so that they can show that they didn't keep this.
[02:08:18.607 --> 02:08:35.836]  They have to keep their credibility with the listeners out there and their readers by exposing a little of this, not the in-depth that you and I would, which we dig out, but they have to expose some of it to keep their credibility, which is waning tremendously today.
[02:08:35.916 --> 02:08:38.437]  That's why people are turning to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:39.389 --> 02:08:40.591]  I think so.
[02:08:56.210 --> 02:09:00.075]  The leftist media has been so easy on George Bush.
[02:09:00.595 --> 02:09:04.480]  They just stopped peddling George Bush because he's one of them.
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:06.682]  I was about to say, you took the words out of my mouth.
[02:09:07.163 --> 02:09:10.747]  I mean, Bush, and I go back to this, total amnesty, he's pushing it.
[02:09:11.167 --> 02:09:24.036]  Massive gun control, reauthorization of the assault weapons ban, blocking arming the pilots, to this day, signing campaign finance reform, expanding the Department of Education, signing on to UNESCO.
[02:09:24.536 --> 02:09:26.878]  This guy's getting more through than Bill Clinton.
[02:09:27.218 --> 02:09:33.062]  And Jack, I've been on radio shows and had people call me a liberal because I'm saying George Bush is the liberal.
[02:09:33.323 --> 02:09:34.523]  What do you say to those people?
[02:09:35.864 --> 02:09:37.806]  Well, it's the old show game, brother.
[02:09:38.306 --> 02:09:39.627]  It's always been the case.
[02:09:40.307 --> 02:09:53.977]  It's always been the case that when you give the Christian Republicans out there, Conservatives, a Republican Socialist, they'll follow him over a cliff.
[02:09:54.837 --> 02:10:06.686]  And if you have a majority, as they tell us, that we have a majority of the people in this nation are Christian, anytime they give us a so-called Christian, what I call a political Christian, like they did with
[02:10:07.568 --> 02:10:13.919]  Uh, with Jimmy Peanut Carter, who is head of the Trilateral Commission, uh, as president.
[02:10:14.019 --> 02:10:19.129]  And now we've got this George Bush, the skull and bones George Bush, now calling himself a Christian.
[02:10:19.696 --> 02:10:41.490]  The majority of the Americans will follow him anywhere they want him to go, so I wouldn't be surprised if the liberals don't get behind Bush, because he's accomplishing much more than what Clinton could have done in twenty years in destroying America and bringing us under this world government system, because the majority of the conservatives watch Clinton like a hawk!
[02:10:41.710 --> 02:10:44.092]  Well, it had to be a Judas Iscariot.
[02:10:44.392 --> 02:10:48.875]  I mean, the enemy that crawls in under the fence to open the gate
[02:10:49.455 --> 02:10:50.436]  That's right, absolutely.
[02:10:50.456 --> 02:10:54.699]  So the majority of the American people will watch a liberal democrat like a hawk and the
[02:11:05.469 --> 02:11:10.111]  Liberal, Socialist, Humanist, Republican can do anything they want to.
[02:11:10.351 --> 02:11:12.732]  As a matter of fact, the majority of the people will help them do it.
[02:11:12.872 --> 02:11:14.353]  Well, now they're announcing the U.N.
[02:11:14.433 --> 02:11:15.974]  is going to be coming into Iraq.
[02:11:16.014 --> 02:11:17.574]  I mean, that was staged from the beginning.
[02:11:18.955 --> 02:11:19.335]  The U.N.
[02:11:19.355 --> 02:11:20.376]  wasn't against this war.
[02:11:20.616 --> 02:11:22.136]  They were playing the part of the good cop.
[02:11:22.677 --> 02:11:23.197]  That's right.
[02:11:23.237 --> 02:11:24.317]  Good cop, bad cop.
[02:11:24.357 --> 02:11:24.878]  That's right.
[02:11:26.338 --> 02:11:28.319]  You're very wise there, Brother Alex.
[02:11:28.939 --> 02:11:29.780]  Yes, that's right.
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:31.240]  That goes on a lot.
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:32.581]  It's all psychological
[02:11:35.345 --> 02:11:54.360]  I was talking to a young lady who was going to school at Sam Houston University, the big law enforcement school in East Texas, and she told me that they teach them how to con people into letting them search the vehicle.
[02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:55.581]  Oh yes, yes.
[02:11:55.601 --> 02:11:57.923]  Citizens don't know their rights, get them to agree to it.
[02:11:58.593 --> 02:12:01.696]  And I was talking to another friend of mine whose son just graduated.
[02:12:01.716 --> 02:12:02.876]  He's now a state police officer.
[02:12:02.897 --> 02:12:04.458]  And of course, he knew the truth.
[02:12:05.158 --> 02:12:08.761]  And they were teaching him that the Russian and Chinese model is the way to go.
[02:12:09.061 --> 02:12:12.144]  And they actually have Chinese flags and Chinese badges.
[02:12:12.564 --> 02:12:17.588]  But then when the old alumni come in, they actually take all that out of the classrooms.
[02:12:17.608 --> 02:12:18.469]  Did you know that, Jack?
[02:12:18.809 --> 02:12:21.691]  I've heard this from other officers that write to us.
[02:12:21.892 --> 02:12:23.113]  I've been out of it now since 1986.
[02:12:25.194 --> 02:12:26.714]  I'm getting it second hand now.
[02:12:26.754 --> 02:12:28.715]  I used to be one of those academy instructors.
[02:12:28.735 --> 02:12:31.496]  Oh, we've shown photos of this on TV and the textbooks.
[02:12:31.676 --> 02:12:31.936]  Yeah.
[02:12:32.256 --> 02:12:44.859]  Well, I can tell you, Alex, this is true because when I was teaching in the police academies, we would teach these young skulls full of mush, these young cadets, the 20 and 21 year olds that had no life experience.
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:47.861]  How to get a confession out of you.
[02:12:48.942 --> 02:12:56.669]  When they put you in the back of the police car, they get a confession out of you without reading near your right, and then hold up in court.
[02:12:57.370 --> 02:12:59.612]  And we, all officers, know how to do that.
[02:12:59.672 --> 02:13:07.839]  They just put you in the back of the police car and sit up front, turn on the tape recorder, and then they let you sit there and don't say a word to you until you start talking.
[02:13:07.859 --> 02:13:09.100]  You'll start saying, now what'd I do?
[02:13:09.721 --> 02:13:11.042]  Officer, was it this?
[02:13:11.062 --> 02:13:11.502]  Was it that?
[02:13:11.542 --> 02:13:12.303]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:16.451 --> 02:13:22.394]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:13:22.614 --> 02:13:24.875]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[02:13:52.233 --> 02:13:52.613]  That's right.
[02:14:14.102 --> 02:14:17.584]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.

[02:15:32.634 --> 02:15:34.495]  Government should only exist to protect those rights.
[02:15:34.735 --> 02:15:36.396]  This calendar affirms your ideals.

[02:15:49.423 --> 02:15:50.584]  We want you to spread the word.
[02:15:50.765 --> 02:15:53.548]  Prices decrease significantly when the quantity ordered is increased.

[02:15:58.973 --> 02:16:00.535]  Know your rights, granted by God.
[02:16:00.836 --> 02:16:03.278]  The very rights our government was created to protect.
[02:16:03.418 --> 02:16:06.041]  The Freedom Calendar is available now at Midas Resources.
[02:16:06.061 --> 02:16:06.341]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:16:06.362 --> 02:16:08.143]  Get it now and start spreading the truth.
[02:16:12.978 --> 02:16:16.303]  If you're like most Americans, you've heard how low interest rates are these days.
[02:16:16.404 --> 02:16:18.507]  So why are you still struggling to pay off debt?
[02:16:18.827 --> 02:16:21.351]  Rates on debt consolidation loans are at all-time lows.
[02:16:21.491 --> 02:16:26.539]  So the time to consolidate your individual credit card balances, car loans, and other debt has never been better.
[02:16:26.679 --> 02:16:28.302]  And no one makes it easier than the credit people.
[02:16:28.302 --> 02:16:28.782]  We're good to go.
[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:51.582]  Since interest rates have dropped, the Credit People have helped thousands of homeowners consolidate almost a billion dollars in loan debt.

[02:17:03.925 --> 02:17:04.505]  Don't miss this opportunity.
[02:17:04.545 --> 02:17:04.885]  Call now!
[02:17:04.905 --> 02:17:04.965]  1-800-794-2858.
[02:17:04.985 --> 02:17:05.045]  1-800-794-2858.
[02:17:15.998 --> 02:17:21.121]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:21.821 --> 02:17:24.183]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:17:24.203 --> 02:17:42.675]  It was an old Roman tactic to send in an abusive, ruthless individual after a territory had first been conquered and then to have proclamations about how a wonderful new sweet governor was coming and the people would
[02:17:43.337 --> 02:17:51.280]  Then, in many cases, except greater forms of oppression, just because it was someone different removing the thug before them.
[02:17:52.661 --> 02:17:54.182]  And again, more of good cop, bad cop.
[02:17:54.202 --> 02:18:03.966]  I know that we have Bill and Daniel and Charles and Kevin and Leif and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:18:03.986 --> 02:18:05.546]  We'll get to you in just a few minutes, I promise.
[02:18:06.347 --> 02:18:06.987]  Jack McClam,
[02:18:08.806 --> 02:18:13.347]  You have traveled the country, you've given hundreds of speeches, if not thousands, to police and military.
[02:18:13.407 --> 02:18:20.829]  A lot of them are awake, a lot of them aren't though, or a lot of them consciously choose to join the evil, thinking that they'll be protected by it.
[02:18:23.189 --> 02:18:31.231]  Some of the tactics you use to break these people's conditioning, I know the truth is your secret weapon in history, but how do you do it so successfully?
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:47.428]  Well, we've had a lot of help, and the reason we've been successful is the private sector, those listening to your show today that aren't in law enforcement or the military, have helped us reach a brother or sister in the military or law enforcement in their family or their community.
[02:18:47.969 --> 02:18:48.909]  Listen to this.
[02:18:49.269 --> 02:18:56.934]  Somebody gave a police officer one of our constitutional police and military publications,
[02:18:58.237 --> 02:18:59.598]  And here's what he writes back.
[02:18:59.638 --> 02:19:05.383]  He says, as you know, we don't give training in what the rights of our countrymen are in any police academy.
[02:19:05.803 --> 02:19:12.849]  How easy it is to take someone's rights if the people don't know what their rights are and the police officers don't know what the people's rights are.
[02:19:13.493 --> 02:19:22.276]  I will help in my department, but we must awaken our brothers and sisters OJT on the job training as we do our jobs in the streets.
[02:19:22.736 --> 02:19:33.279]  Send me 20 of your last issue of Aid in the Battle and the government funded and promoted takeover of the Southwest by Mexico and 20 copies of the issue with the article on the U.S.
[02:19:33.839 --> 02:19:35.640]  Constitution versus the U.N.
[02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:36.080]  Charter.
[02:19:36.767 --> 02:19:38.108]  And here's another fellow up here.
[02:19:38.529 --> 02:19:45.035]  Dear fellow officers, I want to assist you in getting education material in the hands of my fellow soldiers here at Fort Blank.
[02:19:45.936 --> 02:19:47.617]  Tell me what I can do to help.
[02:19:48.278 --> 02:19:49.419]  And another one up here.
[02:19:49.439 --> 02:19:51.961]  This guy's in trouble, Officer McGlam.
[02:19:52.021 --> 02:20:01.250]  I'm being persecuted for siding with a good citizen in his case against fellow officers who beat him unjustifiably and arrested him on trumped-up charges of assault.
[02:20:01.975 --> 02:20:03.656]  And let me stop you for a second, Jack, because
[02:20:32.189 --> 02:20:36.112]  Police think, hey, cover up for your buddies and everything will be alright in the end.
[02:20:36.192 --> 02:20:36.392]  No!
[02:20:36.732 --> 02:20:37.993]  That breeds corruption.
[02:20:38.053 --> 02:20:39.794]  It lets a corrupt system use you.
[02:20:40.134 --> 02:20:46.138]  It then turns the people against the police and it destroys the country in which your children are going to be raised.
[02:20:46.278 --> 02:20:47.039]  Amen, brother.
[02:20:47.079 --> 02:20:47.619]  That's right.
[02:20:47.799 --> 02:20:48.360]  Exactly.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:49.781]  Yeah.
[02:20:50.021 --> 02:20:55.244]  And so many of these good brothers and sisters in uniform don't even know how they're brainwashed.
[02:20:55.845 --> 02:21:00.608]  And so what we do is we publish that police and military written
[02:21:01.582 --> 02:21:14.510]  A constitutional publication for lawmen and police officers, I mean soldiers, and so what you have is, Alex, it's like when you go into your dentist and you try to tell your dentist how to fix your teeth.
[02:21:15.130 --> 02:21:20.754]  He may, if he's got good bedside manner, pat you on the head and say, there, there, but he's not going to listen to you.
[02:21:21.234 --> 02:21:26.898]  But another dentist can come in right behind you and tell him the same thing and he will listen to it and he will heed it.
[02:21:27.558 --> 02:21:30.380]  And the same with if, God forbid, you have to go to an attorney.
[02:21:30.922 --> 02:21:38.329]  But if you go into an attorney and you try to tell him how to do your case, you know, try your case, he's not going to listen to you.
[02:21:38.349 --> 02:21:42.232]  But an attorney could come in and say the same thing and he's going to listen.
[02:21:42.272 --> 02:21:50.079]  So for 20 years, we've been there for the public to use us to awaken those brothers and sisters in uniform.
[02:21:50.279 --> 02:21:51.280]  Let me give you an example.
[02:21:53.052 --> 02:22:00.996]  A lot of dentists wouldn't listen to the fluoride debate, but then as more dentists brought forward the evidence and scientists gave them information, they are listening.
[02:22:01.656 --> 02:22:02.316]  That's right.
[02:22:02.456 --> 02:22:03.437]  Absolutely right.
[02:22:04.117 --> 02:22:18.763]  We have this peer group, you know, in all these professions, and it's the same in law enforcement, so the people can really do well at awakening their brothers and sisters there in their communities and their families if they'll just let us do it.
[02:22:19.284 --> 02:22:20.504]  We're all volunteers.
[02:22:20.644 --> 02:22:22.405]  We're not asking for your money to...
[02:22:22.930 --> 02:22:30.115]  For any reason, we'll send you our police and military constitutional publications.
[02:22:30.155 --> 02:22:30.795]  You get them out.
[02:22:31.315 --> 02:22:36.138]  Put them under the windshield wiper of any squad car you see in your community.
[02:22:36.619 --> 02:22:38.180]  Get back in your car and drive off.
[02:22:38.260 --> 02:22:40.341]  And that brother or sister will call us.
[02:22:41.001 --> 02:22:44.724]  They'll write to us after they read that police and military publication.
[02:22:45.224 --> 02:22:46.205]  And guess what, Alex?
[02:22:46.285 --> 02:22:50.908]  Then that soldier or police officer becomes our agent for God and country.
[02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:53.750]  Stay there, Jack.
[02:22:54.531 --> 02:22:55.032]  We've got a break.
[02:22:55.052 --> 02:23:02.379]  When we come back, I want to take some calls and I want to talk about how the government's tried to counter you, and if that's been effective.
[02:23:02.399 --> 02:23:03.100]  Be right back.
[02:23:05.402 --> 02:23:06.343]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.783 --> 02:23:08.405]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.306 --> 02:23:11.989]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.473 --> 02:23:18.074]  Hardly a day goes by in the garden without the Cobra Head.
[02:23:18.234 --> 02:23:21.095]  I want to tell you about a great little garden tool called the Cobra Head.
[02:23:21.295 --> 02:23:28.077]  First, take half of the tools you're currently using in the garden, throw them away, and call 1-866-SAMA, Ultram, Viagra, and many more.
[02:23:28.297 --> 02:23:29.197]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[02:23:29.217 --> 02:23:30.117]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescription.
[02:23:41.519 --> 02:23:44.339]  Alright my friends, we're back live.
[02:23:44.499 --> 02:23:52.581]  I'm about to go back to Jack McClann and these loaded phone lines of folks who want to talk to him.
[02:23:52.601 --> 02:23:54.281]  Before I do that, I do want to encourage you to
[02:24:04.404 --> 02:24:06.467]  Find out just how serious things have gotten.
[02:24:06.487 --> 02:24:14.596]  The FDA, working with the EU, want to ban basically all over-the-counter vitamins, including vitamin C. They've already done it in Germany and many other areas.
[02:24:15.517 --> 02:24:21.444]  And of course, another neo-con-Republican has a bill to do it, right now in the House of Representatives.
[02:24:22.296 --> 02:24:40.824]  You need to go to HerbalHealer.com and sign up for their free 120-page color catalog with incredibly low prices on the best brands and with the most diverse selection of herbs, natural remedies, spices.
[02:24:40.984 --> 02:24:42.865]  I mean, you name it, they got it, folks.
[02:24:43.125 --> 02:24:43.925]  They've been around since 1987.
[02:24:46.423 --> 02:25:05.220]  They love America, they're aware of the New World Order, and they've just got a lexicon, a cornucopia, a plethora, whatever word you want to use, a lot of information, a free catalog, a free, lengthy, monthly newsletter that you can get by email or mail to you for free.
[02:25:06.281 --> 02:25:08.803]  Folks, you need to go to HerbalHealer.com.
[02:25:08.843 --> 02:25:11.906]  That's H-E-R-B-A-L-H-E-A-L-D-E-R-B-A-L-H-E-A-L-D.
[02:25:13.137 --> 02:25:18.599]  There's no D. H-E-R-B-A-L-H-E-A-L-E-R dot com.
[02:25:18.959 --> 02:25:24.242]  Herbalhealer.com or call them right now and tell them Alex Jones sent you for the free catalog and information at 870-269-4177.
[02:25:24.262 --> 02:25:24.302]  870-269-4177.
[02:25:24.522 --> 02:25:25.802]  Herbal Healer Academy, folks.
[02:25:26.162 --> 02:25:27.023]  They've got it all.
[02:25:38.718 --> 02:25:45.105]  Now, going back to Jack McClellan, before he leaves us at the end of this hour, we will plug how you get a free copy of his newsletter.
[02:25:45.185 --> 02:25:49.110]  It's like three bucks for the trouble, which we really appreciate him doing, which is very powerful.
[02:25:52.498 --> 02:25:56.721]  We're going to go to these calls in just a second, but real quick, you've been very effective.
[02:25:56.881 --> 02:25:59.402]  You've reached millions of police and military over the years.
[02:25:59.962 --> 02:26:04.185]  A lot of them wake up, but they've always got new, young, dumb ones to get in there.
[02:26:05.045 --> 02:26:08.808]  What types of tactics have the feds used to counter you and others?
[02:26:08.848 --> 02:26:14.271]  Because I know when police send us videotapes of lectures FEMA and others give, it's
[02:26:15.248 --> 02:26:18.269]  You've got to watch these conspiracy theorists, these right-wingers.
[02:26:18.689 --> 02:26:25.931]  They've got cops, and people in suits, and well-spoken people, and there's a grain of truth to it, but you've got to watch them, and they're the enemy.
[02:26:28.131 --> 02:26:29.271]  Can you speak to that?
[02:26:30.072 --> 02:26:30.832]  Oh, yes, brother.
[02:26:30.872 --> 02:26:33.373]  That's the in-service training.
[02:26:33.773 --> 02:26:39.174]  Initial academy training is filled with that, and then, of course, your in-service training every few years.
[02:26:39.935 --> 02:26:44.438]  They call all the officers back in off the street and re-indoctrinate them.
[02:26:44.799 --> 02:26:46.079]  Upgrade the propaganda.
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:54.566]  Right, and re-indoctrinate them and give them the new buzzwords that those that love God and the Constitution are using and turn it into a negative.
[02:26:55.586 --> 02:26:58.869]  So, yes, this is part of their training.
[02:27:00.290 --> 02:27:08.696]  As you know, one of the most enlightening for the listening audience out there was, thank goodness, for the FBI.
[02:27:09.507 --> 02:27:12.197]  Agent that published that FBI flyer.
[02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:17.953]  On who the domestic terrorists are in the United States that you talked about on your show.
[02:27:18.454 --> 02:27:25.498]  And we've used, we actually printed it in our Adenabeth Police Military Newsletter listing good Christians and anybody that loves the Constitution.
[02:27:25.538 --> 02:27:27.060]  It says defenders of the U.S.
[02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:29.741]  Constitution, period, are terrorists.
[02:27:29.821 --> 02:27:35.745]  It says gun groups, it says those that make frequent references to the Constitution.
[02:27:36.005 --> 02:27:42.610]  How does a police officer swear an oath to that Constitution and then be told it's crazy if you believe in it?
[02:27:43.091 --> 02:27:46.717]  Well, it's not difficult when you've got a captive audience.
[02:27:46.778 --> 02:27:53.009]  When I went through the police academy, brother, they were in 1976, they were heavily indoctrinating us.
[02:27:53.070 --> 02:27:53.671]  They told us
[02:27:54.562 --> 02:27:56.704]  You can't trust the citizens out there.
[02:27:57.084 --> 02:27:57.865]  This is a quote.
[02:27:58.265 --> 02:28:00.327]  You can't trust them to ever come to your help.
[02:28:00.387 --> 02:28:03.310]  If you ever need help, you can only trust a fellow officer.
[02:28:04.191 --> 02:28:11.197]  If it wasn't for the thin blue line, the citizens would totally destroy themselves and the nation you love.
[02:28:11.778 --> 02:28:16.322]  And so right at the police academy level, they start brainwashing these young 20 and 21 year olds.
[02:28:17.748 --> 02:28:24.990]  That they are there as your supervisor to supervise you for the good of yourself and the whole nation so you don't destroy the nation.
[02:28:25.650 --> 02:28:30.812]  So it takes a while, but it's easy to brainwash these young people that have no life experience.
[02:28:30.952 --> 02:28:39.895]  But funny, Jack, I would ask those police officers, the more cops, the bigger the drug war, the bigger this whole system gets, the more police state, the more crime.
[02:28:40.095 --> 02:28:43.376]  The New World Order hasn't designed things to ever fix the problems.
[02:28:43.416 --> 02:28:46.197]  In fact, they create the crises to offer the solution.
[02:28:47.341 --> 02:28:47.961]  That's right.
[02:28:48.121 --> 02:28:49.082]  Yes, that's right.
[02:28:49.963 --> 02:28:53.364]  The Founding Fathers warned us repeatedly way back then.
[02:28:54.265 --> 02:29:11.595]  Thomas Jefferson, Alexandra Hamilton, and I think it's Federalist Paper 8, you know, they warned us right in the documents about that there would be times that despotic governments would create fear and panic in the minds of the people to take away their freedoms.
[02:29:13.237 --> 02:29:15.078]  And that's exactly what's happened again today.
[02:29:15.098 --> 02:29:16.199]  Let's take some calls, Jack.
[02:29:16.259 --> 02:29:21.021]  Let's talk to Bill in New Jersey, Dale, Charles, Kevin, Leif, and others.
[02:29:21.502 --> 02:29:22.222]  Go ahead, Bill.
[02:29:22.242 --> 02:29:27.105]  Okay, Bill may no longer be there.
[02:29:28.065 --> 02:29:29.346]  Compliments to you.
[02:29:29.406 --> 02:29:31.567]  Keep up the good work, okay?
[02:29:31.707 --> 02:29:31.887]  Okay.
[02:29:31.987 --> 02:29:40.892]  Right here in New Jersey, any car made after 1996, okay, will be connected to the New Jersey State Inspection System.
[02:29:41.687 --> 02:29:49.732]  And you go for inspection to get your car inspected, they will connect to your car computer and what they are doing is seasoning everyone.
[02:29:50.205 --> 02:29:55.969]  Getting them used to the habit of connecting to the statewide or nationwide computer system.
[02:29:56.249 --> 02:29:58.351]  That is a federal, sir, let me stop you.
[02:29:58.671 --> 02:30:02.573]  That is a federally admitted public document that I had eight years ago.
[02:30:02.654 --> 02:30:03.994]  It's now been in the Associated Press.
[02:30:04.435 --> 02:30:09.518]  A global tax with a national tax, a state tax, a county tax, a city tax.
[02:30:10.079 --> 02:30:11.139]  Everyone will get a cut.
[02:30:11.740 --> 02:30:14.842]  All new cars have a satellite tracker plug-in for the box.
[02:30:15.423 --> 02:30:22.960]  They're gonna make it the law, and they're gonna tax you everywhere you go, and track and trace you, and they're gonna download that information in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:30:24.213 --> 02:30:33.680]  And the Fifth Amendment, every time you go to the gas pump to get your gas, it's going to wirelessly access and track where you drove and what you did.
[02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:35.861]  Now, I didn't know New Jersey had just announced it.
[02:30:35.881 --> 02:30:38.123]  I know Portland and San Francisco had.
[02:30:38.343 --> 02:30:39.064]  Where did you get this?
[02:30:39.084 --> 02:30:50.932]  As of August 3rd, okay, the New Jersey State Broadcasters Association has been running these ads daily, many times daily, on all the major radio networks.
[02:30:51.821 --> 02:30:53.842]  And let me stop you.
[02:30:53.942 --> 02:30:56.563]  Now, they'll claim this is some new thing they just thought up yesterday.
[02:30:56.943 --> 02:31:02.726]  Why, eight years ago, did they start the mandating for all cars globally to have this plug-in system?
[02:31:02.946 --> 02:31:10.289]  And then they said on the news last year, I aired the ABC clip, they said, by accident, they actually said, by accident, this box got in there.
[02:31:10.589 --> 02:31:11.350]  Jack McClam?
[02:31:12.530 --> 02:31:13.811]  By accident, Jack!
[02:31:13.851 --> 02:31:17.053]  Yes, things just happen to happen, don't they, Alex?
[02:31:18.153 --> 02:31:22.556]  What are you going to do when they try to make you bring your old truck in to have a tracker put in it?
[02:31:23.036 --> 02:31:24.297]  That's right, that's right.
[02:31:24.317 --> 02:31:31.101]  This OnStar program is going to be prevalent throughout the whole United States and every single movable vehicle in the near future.
[02:31:31.121 --> 02:31:36.124]  And that's coming to us from on high in some of our federal agencies.
[02:31:36.144 --> 02:31:39.926]  We've got some good federal agents in there that are feeding us information.
[02:31:40.766 --> 02:31:41.467]  So get ready.
[02:31:41.914 --> 02:31:52.518]  You're not going to be able to go to the bathroom without them being able to see you and hear you in there and see what you're doing and what you're... Oh, by the way, that was Television Week as well as Reuters reported.
[02:31:52.938 --> 02:31:57.900]  We've covered these on the Air Jack and posted them on InfoWars.com in the News and Focus section.
[02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:03.302]  They admit that OnStar can be connected to by Homeland Security to listen to you.
[02:32:03.742 --> 02:32:07.344]  All the new cell phones can listen to you and the phone looks like it's off.
[02:32:08.164 --> 02:32:10.065]  And that was on the Green Bay News two weeks ago.
[02:32:10.345 --> 02:32:10.685]  That's right.
[02:32:10.725 --> 02:32:11.706]  And it gets worse.
[02:32:11.886 --> 02:32:12.566]  It gets worse.
[02:32:12.886 --> 02:32:17.509]  By law, when you have the satellite system, the local cops will be able to dial in and listen.
[02:32:18.049 --> 02:32:22.411]  Yes, and another brother just wrote to me here a few days ago.
[02:32:23.132 --> 02:32:32.057]  And talk to me about, he was told that the TVs now, the new TVs will view you as you go about your daily activity, right in your television in your home.
[02:32:32.217 --> 02:32:33.498]  That's out of television week.
[02:32:33.638 --> 02:32:35.699]  Mainstream news.
[02:32:35.739 --> 02:32:36.620]  Now folks, think about this.
[02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:41.763]  We're going to be the kooks when we say we don't want the fiber optic TVs watching us.
[02:32:42.163 --> 02:32:45.205]  We're the kooks because the cell phones are listening.
[02:32:45.625 --> 02:32:46.906]  Jack, how do we counter this?
[02:32:48.402 --> 02:32:54.287]  Well brother, I just tell people that we're not going to counter this at all.
[02:32:54.448 --> 02:32:55.368]  We have a duty.
[02:32:55.388 --> 02:33:02.875]  We say here, duty is ours, consequences are God's, so we have to continue to do your duty Alex, like you do every day.
[02:33:06.522 --> 02:33:24.907]  The 70% it used to be like 90% Christians today from withdrawing from the battle, hiding in their prayer closet for something called the rapture and believing their ministers when they lied to them and tell them to obey everything evil government tells them to do because all evil government's of God and God will get you if you don't obey evil government.
[02:33:25.988 --> 02:33:40.400]  I blame the 70% of my brother and sister Christians out there that have totally withdrawn from the institutions and let them be taken over by these damnable despots and the minions of Lucifer in these agencies all the way up to the White House.
[02:33:40.921 --> 02:33:43.043]  So, brother, I don't see us stopping it.
[02:33:43.383 --> 02:33:49.789]  We have a duty to awaken as many police and soldiers as we can here and private sector people as we can.
[02:33:50.938 --> 02:33:56.360]  But we're not going to win it at this level because the people are so brainwashed.
[02:33:56.721 --> 02:33:58.141]  We're not going to reach the majority.
[02:33:58.161 --> 02:33:59.041]  Let me say this, though.
[02:33:59.061 --> 02:34:00.882]  We do see a backlash of Patriot Act.
[02:34:01.182 --> 02:34:02.883]  We do see a counter-revolution.
[02:34:02.923 --> 02:34:05.404]  The problem is they're just going to blow more stuff up.
[02:34:05.464 --> 02:34:05.964]  That's it.
[02:34:06.164 --> 02:34:06.404]  Yes.
[02:34:06.845 --> 02:34:15.028]  Tomorrow, if we get too successful, tomorrow they're going to blow the top off the state houses in about four or five states.
[02:34:15.603 --> 02:34:27.407]  And the people will drop down on their knees and demand, not ask for, but they will demand martial law on the streets of their towns and cities, and the government will gladly give them martial law.
[02:34:27.587 --> 02:34:30.008]  Well, did you hear about the Philippines?
[02:34:30.028 --> 02:34:40.631]  300 of their top special forces took over a building and brought out the documents and said, we have to do this for attention, the government's carrying out the terror for martial law.
[02:34:41.678 --> 02:34:46.059]  And we're tired of being killed by our own government agents with the U.S.
[02:34:46.079 --> 02:34:47.840]  government for this phony war on terror.
[02:34:48.060 --> 02:34:48.380]  Yeah.
[02:34:49.220 --> 02:34:50.441]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:34:50.501 --> 02:35:04.745]  We're living in very exciting times, and unless the people will come out of their houses and become active instead of just cringing in the corners of their houses, afraid to come out, that's the only way we're going to turn it around.
[02:35:04.945 --> 02:35:08.386]  We do see more police and soldiers joining us every day.
[02:35:09.188 --> 02:35:10.229]  So what happens, John?
[02:35:31.585 --> 02:35:35.309]  And ask them for martial law on the streets of the cities, and then it's all over.
[02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:41.294]  Unless we expose who the criminals are, and the government-sponsored terror, and that's why that's so important.
[02:35:41.555 --> 02:35:45.358]  And then if we expose that, they're going to launch World War III, which they got brewing.
[02:35:45.638 --> 02:35:47.861]  Bill of New Jersey sent... They sure do.
[02:35:47.901 --> 02:35:56.549]  Remember, it was none other than, what's his name, Colonel Hackworth and Colonel Dave somebody on Fox News that said,
[02:35:57.409 --> 02:36:04.134]  That we're over there right now in a 20-year war and we're going to go to Iran and Syria and all those nations next.
[02:36:04.254 --> 02:36:05.675]  And they're right on target.
[02:36:05.715 --> 02:36:15.361]  This is going to be World War III against one billion Arabs and Muslims and whoever else may join them, which could be the Red Chinese, join their side.
[02:36:15.441 --> 02:36:17.443]  Don't worry, we've got a national draft for everybody.
[02:36:17.463 --> 02:36:18.383]  Let's take some more calls.
[02:36:19.404 --> 02:36:20.665]  Dale in Pennsylvania.
[02:36:20.945 --> 02:36:21.786]  Thanks for the call, Dale.
[02:36:21.806 --> 02:36:22.286]  You're on the air.
[02:36:23.615 --> 02:36:29.938]  Yeah, hi Jack and Alex, and this 20-year military veteran would like to comment on something Jack said about being very active.
[02:36:30.378 --> 02:36:38.562]  Now's the time to be active, and the best way to do that is like to distribute Alex's three latest videos and Jack's book Operation Vampire Killer 2000.
[02:36:39.982 --> 02:36:43.864]  And I just want to say it's one of the best primers on the New World Order out there.
[02:36:43.944 --> 02:36:45.585]  And the great work of Rick Dalton.
[02:36:46.212 --> 02:36:46.552]  Yes.
[02:36:46.792 --> 02:36:47.733]  And Jack McLam.
[02:36:47.813 --> 02:36:50.053]  And also Rick Dalton too, yes.
[02:36:50.454 --> 02:36:58.317]  And it's 75 pages, and Jack allows people to make copies of that book, but he has ridiculously low prices if you'll buy the book in bulk.
[02:36:58.717 --> 02:37:06.300]  And the book is not, and his newsletter, both the book and the newsletter are not just aimed at police, it's also for military personnel.
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:12.922]  And as Jack and Rick have said in the past, tyranny is not going to come to our doors in America unless it comes in uniform.
[02:37:13.342 --> 02:37:14.783]  And now's the time to get
[02:37:15.683 --> 02:37:20.550]  Our police officers and our military personnel get this book especially into their hands.
[02:37:20.610 --> 02:37:24.375]  And Alex's last three videos, they're the best informational tools out there.
[02:37:24.716 --> 02:37:27.500]  We need to wake these folks up and we need to wake them up now.
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:29.723]  And that's the whole mission of Jack's organization.
[02:37:30.279 --> 02:37:37.421]  I just want to urge people again, buy that book in bulk, Operation Vampire Killer 2000, and I want to thank you both for all you do.
[02:37:37.721 --> 02:37:38.361]  Well, thank you.
[02:37:38.401 --> 02:37:40.422]  Let's go on to some more callers here.
[02:37:40.582 --> 02:37:43.703]  Hey, I want to thank that brother for all he does, too.
[02:37:43.783 --> 02:37:47.684]  I know who he is, and he does a lot himself, and Lord bless him for it.
[02:37:48.064 --> 02:37:48.684]  Absolutely.
[02:37:48.744 --> 02:37:50.325]  Charles, in Florida.
[02:37:50.365 --> 02:37:50.945]  You're on the air.
[02:37:50.985 --> 02:37:51.425]  Go ahead.
[02:37:51.505 --> 02:37:53.086]  Hey, Alex and Jack.
[02:37:53.166 --> 02:37:56.967]  Yeah, I wanted to draw your attention, if you didn't know about the U.S.
[02:37:57.594 --> 02:38:04.916]  The Naval Institute Magazine, which is all the top brass of the Navy.
[02:38:05.076 --> 02:38:09.037]  My friend of mine, who's dead, retired from the Pentagon, put me onto this.
[02:38:09.077 --> 02:38:14.239]  He just quit taking the magazine because he was so disgusted.
[02:38:14.739 --> 02:38:25.302]  It's in the February 2002 issue, advocating atomic war with Russia and China, and advocating a total mobilization of everybody under a draft.
[02:38:26.328 --> 02:38:29.171]  People from 15 to 55, but just everybody.
[02:38:29.351 --> 02:38:34.736]  No, it's old women, old people, digging ditches, working in private factories, troops over you.
[02:38:35.036 --> 02:38:38.800]  I've seen them announce it on C-SPAN, literal Soviet America.
[02:38:40.742 --> 02:38:45.446]  Jack, did you know about the thing in the latest Economist, the Wall Street Journal of England?
[02:38:46.287 --> 02:38:51.692]  Last July, they had a Randy Weaver-style killing of a militia chaplain in Michigan.
[02:38:52.686 --> 02:38:55.548]  This was in last July and it was completely hushed up.
[02:38:55.568 --> 02:38:58.329]  Well, yeah, they smashed it with tanks and burned the whole place.
[02:38:58.709 --> 02:39:00.410]  We posted photos on InfoWars.
[02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:09.174]  Yes, yes, a sad situation and it's too bad the national press just held the lid on that one because very few people know about it.
[02:39:09.474 --> 02:39:12.075]  It doesn't look up Alex's... Absolutely.
[02:39:12.095 --> 02:39:13.216]  ...or hear Alex's show.
[02:39:13.436 --> 02:39:14.296]  Thanks a lot, Charles.
[02:39:14.316 --> 02:39:14.937]  Great points.
[02:39:15.317 --> 02:39:17.958]  Jack McClam, my cousin, is an officer in the Army.
[02:39:18.378 --> 02:39:21.540]  He got into Special Forces and then got into Logistics and other things.
[02:39:22.020 --> 02:39:24.222]  He's always been overseas, and we're at Fort Bright.
[02:39:24.382 --> 02:39:29.407]  Now he's in Austin, merging the APD with the military and the National Guard.
[02:39:29.807 --> 02:39:32.109]  And he told me, he said, Alex, I believe what you say now.
[02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:46.762]  He said, a few months ago, we got called in, we got told, the officers, hundreds of us, at an officer's meeting, that I had to drive to in East Texas, again, at the Sam Houston University, and I was told, we're all getting implantable, trackable chips in two years.
[02:39:48.317 --> 02:39:52.980]  Yes, I've heard this before, but we haven't been able to document it, but I think it's true.
[02:39:53.020 --> 02:39:55.001]  My cousin didn't believe me on this stuff.
[02:39:55.041 --> 02:39:57.382]  We've heard it through so many sources, I believe it's true.
[02:39:57.402 --> 02:40:01.044]  They've been all over the news saying everybody needs them.
[02:40:01.665 --> 02:40:03.886]  Oh yes, they've been promoting that for years.
[02:40:04.146 --> 02:40:05.627]  Think how crazy it is.
[02:40:05.687 --> 02:40:07.628]  It's like the movie V or something.
[02:40:07.708 --> 02:40:11.951]  They're telling them, you're all getting ships and the terrorists are going to get you.
[02:40:12.191 --> 02:40:13.051]  Kevin and Mash.
[02:40:13.071 --> 02:40:13.812]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[02:40:13.852 --> 02:40:14.292]  Go ahead.
[02:40:14.312 --> 02:40:15.693]  Hi, Alex.
[02:40:15.713 --> 02:40:17.054]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:40:18.513 --> 02:40:42.808]  There was an article by Henry Maypow of an interview of somebody that had a pen name Savali, an Illuminati defector, and one point this person made was that their, one weakness the Illuminati people that are in there had is that most of them, their morale is low and that they're wounded, abused victims themselves from their own culture and their own lifestyle, all their beliefs.
[02:40:43.549 --> 02:40:45.250]  And that if people can wake up,
[02:40:45.632 --> 02:40:57.976]  I mean, even if it was state capitals being blown up by fake terrorism stuff, if people can wake up and see this, I think they do still have the advantage at this point in time, although we're losing ground.
[02:40:59.056 --> 02:41:01.197]  Well, I'd say people are waking up like never before.
[02:41:01.237 --> 02:41:03.217]  That's why the enemy's accelerating their program.
[02:41:03.597 --> 02:41:03.817]  Right.
[02:41:04.017 --> 02:41:05.298]  That's absolutely right.
[02:41:05.558 --> 02:41:05.818]  Yeah.
[02:41:06.818 --> 02:41:08.019]  See, the thing is, you're right.
[02:41:08.059 --> 02:41:11.580]  These are sick, wounded, twisted people who are willing to kill unlimited amounts of people.
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:13.061]  That's why they're so dangerous.
[02:41:13.121 --> 02:41:18.003]  We've got to prepare people for the government to launch mass nerve gas attacks, or at least smallpox, you name it.
[02:41:18.383 --> 02:41:22.864]  Don't think for a minute that if we start winning this fight, they will start wiping out tens of millions of us.
[02:41:24.185 --> 02:41:29.147]  And it's at that point, that's why they've got the giant FEMA armies of foreign troops ready for total invasion.
[02:41:29.627 --> 02:41:30.568]  I'm not joking, folks.
[02:41:30.608 --> 02:41:33.369]  They've got Red Dawn ready as one of their backup plans.
[02:41:33.409 --> 02:41:33.949]  We'll be back.
[02:41:36.696 --> 02:41:39.620]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:41:40.301 --> 02:41:41.582]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:41:41.783 --> 02:41:47.530]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:41:47.810 --> 02:41:53.037]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:41:53.337 --> 02:41:57.518]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:41:57.658 --> 02:42:01.460]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:42:01.700 --> 02:42:06.341]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:42:06.421 --> 02:42:12.683]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:42:12.723 --> 02:42:14.564]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:42:15.044 --> 02:42:17.125]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[02:42:17.205 --> 02:42:21.467]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:21.547 --> 02:42:23.608]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:24.349 --> 02:42:28.751]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[02:42:28.851 --> 02:42:30.832]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[02:42:31.092 --> 02:42:32.573]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:42:32.773 --> 02:42:34.814]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:42:35.538 --> 02:42:43.062]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:42:43.342 --> 02:42:54.248]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:42:54.508 --> 02:42:56.328]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:42:56.588 --> 02:42:59.909]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:43:00.249 --> 02:43:01.589]  But it's worth every penny.
[02:43:01.710 --> 02:43:10.711]  Because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:43:10.991 --> 02:43:11.492]  That's right!
[02:43:11.692 --> 02:43:18.793]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:43:19.093 --> 02:43:23.174]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter.
[02:43:23.374 --> 02:43:30.600]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:35.484]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:43:35.624 --> 02:43:41.128]  Whether you live in the country or simply dream about living in the country, Countryside and Small Stock Journal is the magazine for you.
[02:43:41.348 --> 02:43:44.250]  You'll learn how to make cheese, sausage, wine, soap, and more.
[02:43:44.371 --> 02:43:47.573]  Build a cider press, a year-round greenhouse, or even your own home.
[02:43:47.733 --> 02:43:48.734]  Raise and care for poultry,
[02:43:48.814 --> 02:43:49.294]  We're good to go.
[02:44:16.836 --> 02:44:20.218]  If you like what you see, pay the invoice and enjoy Countryside for a full year.
[02:44:20.378 --> 02:44:25.100]  If you decide it's not for you, simply write cancel on the invoice, but keep the magazine just for taking a look.
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:26.121]  It's as simple as that.
[02:44:26.341 --> 02:44:29.422]  Get ready to live the good life and call 1-800-551-5691 or visit our website at www.countrysidemag.com
[02:44:41.104 --> 02:44:43.547]  Alright folks, it's Alex Jones back live here.
[02:44:43.627 --> 02:44:45.029]  And it's our final segment.
[02:44:45.129 --> 02:44:47.611]  I want to try to finish up with these callers.
[02:44:58.837 --> 02:45:01.418]  Jack, bottom line, we've got to defend our families.
[02:45:01.438 --> 02:45:02.519]  We've got to wake people up.
[02:45:02.539 --> 02:45:04.720]  We've got a responsibility to warn people.
[02:45:05.060 --> 02:45:12.303]  And I know that if patriots and Christians and good Americans weren't out there fighting the New World Order, we'd be in a much worse position right now.
[02:45:12.343 --> 02:45:13.123]  Would you not agree with that?
[02:45:15.524 --> 02:45:16.224]  Jack?
[02:45:16.284 --> 02:45:18.845]  The people are the ones that are making the difference.
[02:45:19.846 --> 02:45:20.726]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:45:20.906 --> 02:45:21.326]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:21.586 --> 02:45:21.887]  Okay.
[02:45:22.327 --> 02:45:23.967]  Yeah, the people are making the difference.
[02:45:23.987 --> 02:45:27.889]  You and I are just tools of the people out there to use us and use our
[02:45:28.399 --> 02:45:35.301]  Videos, use our publications, use our words over the airwaves to reach the hearts and minds of other Americans.
[02:45:35.681 --> 02:45:36.402]  Absolutely.
[02:45:36.742 --> 02:45:38.842]  It's the people that are going to turn this thing around.
[02:45:38.982 --> 02:45:44.884]  And before we take a final call, plug how folks get a copy of your Aid and Abet newsletter or contact you.
[02:45:45.044 --> 02:45:46.085]  Okay, yes.
[02:45:46.145 --> 02:45:47.125]  Write us here.
[02:45:47.385 --> 02:45:56.188]  You can just put A and A, if you want to, just two A's, A and A, at HC, that's Lake Henry Charles 11.
[02:45:57.529 --> 02:46:04.414]  Box 357, Kamii, K-A-M-I-A-H, Idaho, 83536.
[02:46:07.035 --> 02:46:10.978]  Once again, I gave it a little fast, but just put A-N-A, that's for Aidan and Beth.
[02:46:12.159 --> 02:46:13.960]  H-C-11, Box 357, Kamii, K-A-M-I-A-H,
[02:46:19.128 --> 02:46:19.648]  Idaho 83536.
[02:46:20.689 --> 02:46:24.490]  If you don't mind, send us a $3 donation.
[02:46:24.510 --> 02:46:30.212]  We'll send you out a copy of Aid in the Bed Constitutional Publication for Lawmen and Soldiers.
[02:46:30.352 --> 02:46:30.952]  Or $25, Alex.
[02:46:30.992 --> 02:46:32.412]  They can get on our mailing list.
[02:46:32.672 --> 02:46:33.793]  Nothing secret here.
[02:46:33.873 --> 02:46:36.974]  It's all the people are the sovereigns and we work for them.
[02:46:37.474 --> 02:46:37.954]  All right.
[02:46:38.114 --> 02:46:40.415]  Let's talk to Leif in Missouri.
[02:46:40.455 --> 02:46:41.015]  Last caller.
[02:46:41.035 --> 02:46:41.635]  Go ahead, Leif.
[02:46:42.055 --> 02:46:43.396]  Good afternoon, Alex and Jack.
[02:46:43.596 --> 02:46:46.277]  I apologize for going off topic a little bit, but
[02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:51.411]  The head minion was in Kansas City today, and we went down to catch a glimpse.
[02:46:52.531 --> 02:46:53.751]  Which minion was that?
[02:46:53.771 --> 02:46:55.032]  That was President Bush.
[02:46:55.232 --> 02:46:58.512]  Oh, telling you how wonderful Moore, Nass, and Gatt are.
[02:46:59.113 --> 02:47:01.353]  Yeah, how wonderful the economy is.
[02:47:01.453 --> 02:47:03.173]  Yeah, how wonderful the economy is.
[02:47:03.413 --> 02:47:04.614]  Right.
[02:47:04.694 --> 02:47:10.495]  One of our signs said, the Bush economy so far increased employment overseas and in U.S.
[02:47:10.555 --> 02:47:10.915]  prisons.
[02:47:11.604 --> 02:47:13.005]  Very good, very good.
[02:47:13.025 --> 02:47:14.286]  That got some reaction.
[02:47:14.306 --> 02:47:17.128]  There are signs all over the country that say Bush is the terrorist.
[02:47:17.188 --> 02:47:18.168]  Bush carried out 9-1-1.
[02:47:18.268 --> 02:47:21.771]  And you even see them in like Reuters and AP photo ops.
[02:47:21.871 --> 02:47:22.691]  It's everywhere.
[02:47:22.971 --> 02:47:23.872]  People know.
[02:47:23.952 --> 02:47:24.973]  They're finding out.
[02:47:25.413 --> 02:47:28.195]  You ought to see the front of our latest newsletter.
[02:47:28.275 --> 02:47:30.056]  It shows Bush looking in the mirror.
[02:47:30.116 --> 02:47:34.239]  And the caption is, Bush finally found a weapon of mass destruction.
[02:47:34.299 --> 02:47:37.661]  And he's looking in the mirror and it says, my God, a weapon of mass destruction.
[02:47:40.843 --> 02:47:41.984]  All right, thanks.
[02:47:42.044 --> 02:47:42.764]  Anything else, Leif?
[02:47:43.625 --> 02:47:49.730]  Yeah, I just wanted to say they tried to make it look like there wasn't going to be a lot of people down there, and there was quite a few.
[02:47:50.942 --> 02:47:51.563]  Absolutely.
[02:47:51.643 --> 02:47:52.644]  Take care and keep it up.
[02:47:52.744 --> 02:47:54.285]  Jack McClam, thanks for coming on the show.
[02:47:54.305 --> 02:47:56.347]  Look forward to having you back on in the future.
[02:47:56.507 --> 02:47:57.168]  Okay, brother.
[02:47:57.228 --> 02:47:58.509]  Thanks for all you're doing, Alex.
[02:47:58.609 --> 02:48:00.071]  It all works together for good.
[02:48:00.351 --> 02:48:00.871]  God bless.
[02:48:00.891 --> 02:48:01.872]  Lord bless you.
[02:48:01.892 --> 02:48:02.212]  Bye-bye.
[02:48:02.353 --> 02:48:02.653]  You bet.
[02:48:02.693 --> 02:48:06.156]  We're out of time for this powerful edition of Test Pilot Radio.
[02:48:06.396 --> 02:48:11.221]  I'm Alex Jones, your test pilot, fighting the new world order, going where others have not gone before.
[02:48:12.242 --> 02:48:19.627]  Seriously, I've made nine films, I've written a book, I've published another book by Paul Watson, Order Out of Chaos, my book's Descent into Tyranny.
[02:48:19.847 --> 02:48:20.548]  They're excellent!
[02:48:21.028 --> 02:48:23.410]  Police State, Free Total, Enslavement's my newest film.
[02:48:23.850 --> 02:48:30.335]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get the films or the books online, or to call toll free to get them at 1-888-253-3139.
[02:48:37.333 --> 02:48:38.095]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[02:48:38.155 --> 02:48:41.002]  MoreinfoWars.com or Net or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:48.212 --> 02:48:54.214]  My mailing address is 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:48:55.795 --> 02:48:56.455]  Don't wait.
[02:48:56.875 --> 02:48:57.696]  Get the films.
[02:48:57.916 --> 02:48:58.576]  Get the books.

[02:49:00.317 --> 02:49:01.257]  Get them on AXS TV.
[02:49:01.517 --> 02:49:03.658]  Get them into police and military's hands.
[02:49:04.058 --> 02:49:06.799]  Wake America up to who the terrorists are!
[02:49:07.059 --> 02:49:08.720]  And spread the word about our great affiliates.
[02:49:08.740 --> 02:49:08.840]  888-253-3139 888-253-3139

[02:49:22.783 --> 02:49:24.064]  Have a great evening.
[02:49:27.467 --> 02:49:31.970]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:49:32.310 --> 02:49:36.354]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
