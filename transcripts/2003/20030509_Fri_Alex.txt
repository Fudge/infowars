[00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.651]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:14.778]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.479]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.361]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:19.822]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:21.483]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:25.926]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:30.350]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:37.358]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:37.378 --> 00:00:41.181]  In the second hour, I have those DJs coming on
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.220]  We're good to go.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.700]  We're good to go.
[00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:36.184]  And playing their music and then having venues where they play.
[00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:39.386]  And that's really where they make a lot of their money.
[00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:44.450]  Well, it turns out that they're involved in one of their subsidiaries with the touring Dixie Chicks.
[00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.831]  So, how classic.
[00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:56.557]  You get to have a chilling effect for the First Amendment, send a message not to criticize the government, and at the same time, you make lots of money.
[00:01:56.638 --> 00:01:59.940]  So, we'll be talking about this and censorship in the...
[00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:01.701]  We're good to go.
[00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:02.982]  We're good to go.
[00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:33.837]  They claim it's, quote, good for American manufacturers, but bad for American consumers.
[00:02:33.897 --> 00:02:45.907]  That is, that's why China's always done so well, because they have all the slave goods, and the United States has the strong dollars, so we didn't manufacture much, but we could still buy cheap goods.
[00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:47.829]  Well, that's changing.
[00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.492]  And the Post tries to spin this like it's positive.
[00:02:51.552 --> 00:02:54.835]  It's like telling somebody a case of syphilis is good.
[00:02:55.555 --> 00:02:56.336]  We'll go over it.
[00:02:57.828 --> 00:03:04.149]  Euro hits record high versus the yen and the dollar, and the yen is depressionary levels right now.
[00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.750]  But don't worry, the government had all this planned five years ago.
[00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:17.292]  They've got lots of riot police trained and lots of teams ready to foreclose on your property and ready to take your pension funds, and hey, it'll be wonderful.
[00:03:17.692 --> 00:03:19.572]  It'll be for the homeland.
[00:03:20.093 --> 00:03:20.993]  Don't criticize it.
[00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:22.053]  You're not patriotic.
[00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:32.387]  Also in England, they're going ahead and putting some of the satellite trackers in the cars to tax and trace, and right on the heels of that, old cars face ban from London streets.
[00:03:32.928 --> 00:03:39.337]  You've got to ban the old cars that don't have the satellite tracker boxes in them and force you into the new ones that are totally controlled.
[00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:53.633]  Also, the farmer who shot the people that had robbed him three times in his own home, they've said again in the high court that they must, quote, protect burglars from the menace of householders that defend themselves.
[00:03:53.673 --> 00:03:54.253]  We'll go over that.
[00:03:54.754 --> 00:03:54.974]  U.S.
[00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:56.915]  sued over border deaths.
[00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:07.064]  Mexican troops are routinely killing federal officers, county sheriffs, deputies, and police officers, and American citizens, not to mention the illegals that are crossing.
[00:04:07.104 --> 00:04:09.686]  They feed on them and rob them, the coyotes.
[00:04:11.027 --> 00:04:11.968]  Government doesn't care.
[00:04:12.888 --> 00:04:21.193]  They say that if citizens groups wouldn't have stopped the other citizens groups from putting in water stations for the illegals, there wouldn't have been 14 deaths.
[00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:23.675]  So we've got to aid them in committing their crimes.
[00:04:24.355 --> 00:04:28.778]  Halliburton linked to deals with access of evils is from the Business Report.
[00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.481]  Turns out Halliburton, we reported this years ago, is connected to almost every major business.
[00:04:34.637 --> 00:04:35.658]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:35.698 --> 00:04:37.160]  Really big show today.
[00:04:55.783 --> 00:04:55.863]  U.S.
[00:04:55.923 --> 00:04:58.486]  and Britain acknowledge they are occupying powers in Iraq.
[00:04:58.526 --> 00:04:59.206]  That's official.
[00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:01.709]  And the NRA and Bush square off.
[00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:03.310]  That's the headline, if you really believe that.
[00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:04.772]  They're on the same team.
[00:05:04.832 --> 00:05:06.293]  Get your guns is the name of the game.
[00:05:06.313 --> 00:05:07.294]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.280]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.402]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:05:17.662 --> 00:05:22.804]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:05:23.144 --> 00:05:32.428]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:05:32.768 --> 00:05:37.711]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:42.073]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:05:42.253 --> 00:05:47.056]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:05:47.396 --> 00:05:53.299]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:17.684]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:17.964 --> 00:06:22.707]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:22.927 --> 00:06:28.571]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:28.831 --> 00:06:33.334]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:06:33.554 --> 00:06:40.699]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:45.282]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:06:45.442 --> 00:06:47.964]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:06:48.184 --> 00:06:54.889]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:10.886]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:16.709]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.889]  Probably never, right?
[00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:21.211]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.
[00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:23.932]  He's the owner and founder of the Cal Bend Soap Company.

[00:08:14.154 --> 00:08:14.795]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.455 --> 00:08:16.496]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.236 --> 00:08:18.437]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:18.997 --> 00:08:19.817]  You want answers?
[00:08:20.558 --> 00:08:21.458]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:21.478 --> 00:08:25.781]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:30.384]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.305 --> 00:08:45.647]  Coming up in about, I don't know, 16, 17 minutes, we'll be joined by Jeff Singer and Dave Moore, who are on a local country FM in Colorado Springs.
[00:08:46.547 --> 00:08:52.028]  We're on, of course, on KWYD 1580 in Colorado Springs.
[00:08:52.749 --> 00:09:00.530]  But we're going to have them on because, of course, you heard last week they got suspended for criticizing the Bixie Chicks
[00:09:02.669 --> 00:09:12.614]  And maybe you heard on the news that they got suspended for playing them, but we'll get to the bottom of it.
[00:09:13.054 --> 00:09:22.439]  Because it really turns out that Clear Channel is involved in the tour, and so they kill two birds with one stone, that is the globalists do.
[00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:30.183]  You silence people who would criticize the government, really thinking that you get attacked if you do.
[00:09:31.229 --> 00:09:35.412]  And at the same time, you make lots of money, because that's what Clear Channel's been criticized for doing.
[00:09:35.432 --> 00:09:45.280]  There have been some investigations in the past for owning radio stations, playing specific songs that you have an interest in selling.
[00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:52.228]  In the past, I guess they called it payola, but nowadays it doesn't matter if stuff is questionable.
[00:09:52.689 --> 00:09:55.589]  As long as you're with the establishment, you can go ahead and just do it.
[00:09:56.029 --> 00:10:01.811]  But to look at the bottom of this, but no, they were, to be serious, they were suspended for playing the Dixie Chicks.
[00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:09.152]  And I don't want to get off into some big Dixie Chick discussion, but it's pretty obvious what's happened here.
[00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:15.654]  When they had that Dateline NBC special a few weeks ago, now somebody sent me a tape out of chance to watch it
[00:10:16.497 --> 00:10:17.058]  We're good to go.
[00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.851]  Idiot on the street does it.
[00:10:35.891 --> 00:10:38.654]  It's cute and funny, and they put it on national TV.
[00:10:39.054 --> 00:10:40.015]  This is the mindset.
[00:10:40.055 --> 00:10:46.700]  I mean, we have national TV hosts on MSNBC talking about life in prison if you criticize the government.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.784]  They've got bills introduced for life in prison if you block traffic in a protest.
[00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:55.787]  Everyone in the protest, not just the person that did it, gets life in prison.
[00:10:56.587 --> 00:11:02.112]  We're living in an Orwellian Twilight Zone matrix brew here.
[00:11:04.378 --> 00:11:06.759]  And I'm sorry, I'm a real conservative.
[00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:12.901]  I have the headline here that the NRA and Bush face off, that they're at odds.
[00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:19.863]  And I was talking to Mark during the break, the fellow that runs the show, and he said, Alex, how are people going to square this?
[00:11:19.883 --> 00:11:21.483]  I mean, who's the real conservative?
[00:11:22.063 --> 00:11:24.184]  Is it Bush or is it the NRA?
[00:11:24.244 --> 00:11:26.285]  And obviously it's neither.
[00:11:26.825 --> 00:11:30.426]  I've done whole shows, dozens of shows, exposing the fact
[00:11:30.846 --> 00:11:37.912]  That the NRA, especially their Legislative Affairs Bureau, is actually a gun-grabbing shill organization.
[00:11:38.013 --> 00:11:40.895]  We've had Larry Pratt on and others to expose that.
[00:11:41.295 --> 00:11:44.558]  We've had them try to stop us from defeating gun bills here in Texas.
[00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:51.284]  They didn't want to talk about Bush saying he would reauthorize the assault weapons ban during the election.
[00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:56.629]  They didn't want to go after him now until we called for it and others called for it on real terms.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:05.284]  Patriotic, conservative, libertarian, constitutionalist, Christian, whatever you want to call it, talk radio.
[00:12:06.345 --> 00:12:18.052]  And we've had hundreds of listeners call in live, and I've gotten hundreds of emails and faxes and letters saying that you called the NRA months ago, and they would just deny that Bush even supported the assault weapons ban.
[00:12:18.432 --> 00:12:22.655]  They would then deny that S-22 even existed, the gun registration bill.
[00:12:23.035 --> 00:12:26.657]  But now it's come out that it does, and they weren't going to warn you about it.
[00:12:27.157 --> 00:12:28.878]  So they're loyal opposition.
[00:12:29.258 --> 00:12:29.998]  And it makes sense.
[00:12:30.018 --> 00:12:34.119]  I mean, the NRA gets more members when things are going badly for the Second Amendment.
[00:12:34.459 --> 00:12:35.720]  They get more sign-ups.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:45.463]  When Bill Clinton came in, though, and had the assault weapons ban, it caused Republicans in the name of pro-gun to sweep the House and Senate.
[00:12:46.483 --> 00:12:47.203]  Nothing was done.
[00:12:47.263 --> 00:12:48.724]  Things got worse under them, of course.
[00:12:48.744 --> 00:12:50.344]  They're Trojan horses.
[00:12:51.485 --> 00:12:54.566]  And the NRA, though, got a lot of new members.
[00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:55.346]  And then remember...
[00:12:56.167 --> 00:13:02.932]  George Herbert Walker came out and attacked the NRA when they were actually being more pro-gun.
[00:13:03.272 --> 00:13:05.033]  So they learned their lesson right there.
[00:13:05.373 --> 00:13:17.262]  He said he was resigning his membership because there was an article in the NRA magazine that criticized the BATF at Waco, and that's just not right.
[00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:22.594]  So this family is just establishment.
[00:13:22.614 --> 00:13:23.855]  They're not running anything.
[00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:28.440]  They're titular heads, just like Bill Clinton or Tom Daschle or John Kerry.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.362]  They're all skull and bones little buddies.
[00:13:31.863 --> 00:13:34.526]  They're all in the same clubs, the same organizations.
[00:13:34.926 --> 00:13:39.290]  They all vote together on NAFTA and GATT and open borders and supercomputers in China.
[00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.072]  So let's be honest about it.
[00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:42.994]  This morning I had to go into a local station.
[00:13:43.746 --> 00:13:47.828]  News Talk 1260 and cut a local promo of somebody filling in for their drive-time host.
[00:13:48.308 --> 00:13:50.969]  That's right, burning the oil, burning the candle at both ends.
[00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:52.429]  I'll be doing that all next week.
[00:13:52.669 --> 00:13:58.071]  And I'm driving in this morning, early this morning, listening to talk radio, conservative talk radio.
[00:13:59.532 --> 00:14:10.296]  And flipping around, and the big discussion was, Bush wants to reaffirm the semi-automatic .22 ban, the magazine ban, the handgun ban.
[00:14:10.336 --> 00:14:11.176]  That's really what it is.
[00:14:12.516 --> 00:14:16.758]  And I heard the host, this national host, I'm not going to mention him.
[00:14:16.918 --> 00:14:17.999]  I'm just going to stop doing that.
[00:14:18.039 --> 00:14:18.940]  I didn't do it for years.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.081]  I've been doing it because they so disgust me, but I'm not going to help them.
[00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:22.922]  I'm not going to do it anymore.
[00:14:23.282 --> 00:14:35.768]  This national host, big national conservative host of the morning, said over and over again, well, you've got to commend Bush that he had a campaign promise to reaffirm this gun ban, and he's doing it.
[00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:40.531]  I don't support it, but you know the Second Amendment isn't an absolute right.
[00:14:41.374 --> 00:14:45.997]  And that guy was reading off the Handgun Control Incorporated play sheet.
[00:14:46.797 --> 00:14:49.479]  I mean, it's so obvious what these neocons are.
[00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:52.720]  And so, again, I will make the admission here.
[00:14:53.801 --> 00:14:54.461]  I'm pro-gun 110%.
[00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:56.282]  It's an absolute right.
[00:14:57.623 --> 00:14:58.684]  I'm pro-sovereignty.
[00:14:58.784 --> 00:14:59.604]  I'm pro-family.
[00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:00.645]  I'm for low taxes.
[00:15:00.685 --> 00:15:02.165]  I'm for abolishing the Federal Reserve.
[00:15:03.046 --> 00:15:08.489]  That means, in today's dialectic, that I am a ultra-communist.
[00:15:09.122 --> 00:15:19.067]  Now, if you're a neocon who's an admitted Trotskyite, if you're a beatnik who has a national talk show, and who's an admitted communist, you are now a conservative.
[00:15:19.227 --> 00:15:20.407]  And I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:15:20.627 --> 00:15:22.608]  I am now a communist because I'm pro-America.
[00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:28.951]  They, the communists, learned how to flap American flags in our face and talk about how conservative they are.
[00:15:29.131 --> 00:15:30.212]  They are now the conservatives.
[00:15:31.528 --> 00:15:34.949]  Now, in reality, it's not liberal or conservative or fascist or communist.
[00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:36.910]  All those are just labels to confuse.
[00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.992]  It's feudalism, slavery on one end, demand and control on one end, versus liberty.
[00:15:42.052 --> 00:15:43.812]  And that's the real debate.
[00:15:45.673 --> 00:15:46.473]  I am enraged.
[00:15:46.533 --> 00:15:49.274]  I mean, when Tom Daschle's on TV, we know he's un-American.
[00:15:49.294 --> 00:15:50.674]  We know he hates America.
[00:15:51.135 --> 00:15:52.295]  We know what he's all about.
[00:15:52.795 --> 00:15:57.917]  When George Bush is on TV, landing on aircraft carriers, running around acting conservative...
[00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.094]  Going after his daddy's business partners all over the world.
[00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:05.079]  It's not conservative, folks.
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.324]  It might have some machine or veneer on it, but it's not.
[00:16:09.666 --> 00:16:12.531]  All right, there's a different variant on my opening monologue as of late.
[00:16:13.603 --> 00:16:17.046]  Dollar Descent has currency watchers on edge.
[00:16:17.286 --> 00:16:18.067]  Washington Post.
[00:16:18.587 --> 00:16:20.228]  How many years have I warned you of this?
[00:16:20.328 --> 00:16:20.969]  The plan.
[00:16:20.989 --> 00:16:35.620]  Well, I read the minutes of the public Davos, Switzerland meeting three and a half years ago, where they said they were going to implode our currency, deindustrialize us, and build up the EU.
[00:16:36.961 --> 00:16:39.823]  Now, when Bill Gates and Prince...
[00:16:40.911 --> 00:16:45.835]  Burn hard, and the rest of them are over there spouting off, folks.
[00:16:46.215 --> 00:17:06.930]  You know, when they say they're going to create a new world order, when they say terrorists are about to hit us, we're going to take your rights, and then the terrorists hit us, uh-huh, and they start putting troops on the streets, and SWAT teams raid whole neighborhoods and put bags over women's heads as they drag them out naked in front of the news media, you're not in a free country, folks.
[00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.633]  Hey, they had a war on drugs or triple the heroin, double the cocaine on the streets.
[00:17:12.653 --> 00:17:14.194]  They had a war on poverty, more poverty.
[00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:15.635]  A war on illiteracy, more illiteracy.
[00:17:15.655 --> 00:17:17.137]  They're going to have a war on terror.
[00:17:17.457 --> 00:17:18.278]  Brace yourselves.
[00:17:19.419 --> 00:17:21.040]  They're going to have more terror, unfortunately.
[00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:24.343]  Dollars dissent has currency watchers on edge.
[00:17:24.383 --> 00:17:31.289]  A long slide of the dollar has turned into a rout in recent days, providing a new competitive edge to American manufacturers.
[00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:32.710]  What does that mean?
[00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.473]  But arousing worries of potential instability in the global financial system.
[00:17:37.128 --> 00:17:38.689]  Against the euro in particular, the U.S.
[00:17:38.709 --> 00:17:41.231]  currency's descent is gathering extraordinary speed.
[00:17:41.251 --> 00:17:46.435]  Now, the Washington Post financial writer, Paul Bluston, just told you this was all good.
[00:17:46.455 --> 00:17:50.659]  And I hope Paul Bluston is listening there to our affiliate in D.C.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.141]  I don't try it, Bluston.
[00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:57.004]  I don't know what school of economics you went to, but the plunge of the dollar is the end.
[00:17:57.364 --> 00:18:05.070]  That's all we had left was the high dollar so we could buy the goods from countries that had a low exchange rate.
[00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:09.753]  That's why you can get a $35 VCR and a $50 DVD player.
[00:18:10.093 --> 00:18:11.774]  That's why we have this service economy.
[00:18:12.194 --> 00:18:13.755]  This goods and services economy.
[00:18:14.035 --> 00:18:14.916]  No manufacturing.
[00:18:15.336 --> 00:18:17.677]  If the dollar goes down, we can't buy those goods.
[00:18:17.897 --> 00:18:19.658]  You say good for American manufacturers?
[00:18:20.019 --> 00:18:21.659]  Yes, maybe for the few that are left.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.180]  Maybe.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.182]  But they're already bringing in the third world labor even for the highly skilled jobs.
[00:18:28.067 --> 00:18:30.169]  No, it's not good for our economy, okay?
[00:18:53.621 --> 00:18:55.923]  That's killing almost 10% of your buying power.
[00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:58.946]  Now it's going to kill 15% of your buying power.
[00:18:58.966 --> 00:19:01.108]  Man, I tell you, we're in trouble.
[00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:02.850]  And now they're starting to shut down.
[00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.712]  A lot of service companies are shutting down.
[00:19:04.732 --> 00:19:06.513]  A lot of big chains are shutting down.
[00:19:06.553 --> 00:19:07.354]  I'm sure you've noticed.
[00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:09.236]  Not just Kmart.
[00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:10.857]  Dozens of other major chains.
[00:19:10.897 --> 00:19:12.259]  McDonald's is constricting.
[00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:13.520]  Wendy's is constricting.
[00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.071]  We're good to go.
[00:19:15.111 --> 00:19:15.851]  We're good to go.
[00:19:45.191 --> 00:19:51.138]  As it always, the case for big currency moves, the dollar awakens, weakens, has both benefits and costs.
[00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:56.143]  All right, folks, we'll be right back, and I'll get into all the other news.
[00:19:57.344 --> 00:20:06.434]  Oh, we got these guys coming on who, you know, the land of the free, home of the brave, get suspended for playing a song because, well, Big Brother says don't play it.
[00:20:06.454 --> 00:20:07.115]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:09.901]  We're good to go.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:24.640]  The book,
[00:20:51.619 --> 00:20:56.283]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[00:20:56.503 --> 00:21:00.426]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.

[00:23:11.195 --> 00:23:17.276]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:23:17.456 --> 00:23:21.297]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:23:21.637 --> 00:23:23.538]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:23:23.578 --> 00:23:25.878]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:23:26.018 --> 00:23:33.680]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:43.023]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[00:23:51.206 --> 00:23:52.446]  All right, continuing with the news.
[00:24:20.524 --> 00:24:21.544]  Dollars descent.
[00:24:21.604 --> 00:24:22.864]  We should really talk about that.
[00:24:22.905 --> 00:24:24.105]  We will later in the show.
[00:24:26.205 --> 00:24:31.286]  The euro hit record highs against the yen, and it's best since January 1999 against the dollar.
[00:24:31.886 --> 00:24:34.647]  And it's a steady trend downward for the dollar.
[00:24:35.227 --> 00:24:38.008]  For the fiat currency, this is the danger of a fiat currency.
[00:24:38.488 --> 00:24:45.369]  See, if we had our currency in gold and silver, our worth would be our ingenuity, our labor, our strength.
[00:24:47.185 --> 00:24:51.609]  Now we're at the mercy of the bankers in the Monopoly game they've got set up.
[00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:53.811]  Continuing, U.S.
[00:24:53.911 --> 00:24:55.593]  sued over border deaths.
[00:24:55.713 --> 00:25:02.980]  Families of 14 undocumented immigrants who died in the Arizona desert two years ago are suing the federal government for $42 million.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.161]  The lawsuit filed in the U.S.
[00:25:04.201 --> 00:25:11.868]  District Court in Tucson said the deaths could have been prevented if a humanitarian group had been allowed to install water stations in the desert.
[00:25:12.478 --> 00:25:22.065]  The Mexican government issued over 3 million emergency packs last year full of water, compasses, and food for them to cross.
[00:25:22.226 --> 00:25:38.078]  And the Mexican president, Fox, and the two before him gave speeches here in America to the Mexican supremacist organization, Mecha and others, saying that they were going to take over the United States and Washington is funding the entire thing.
[00:25:38.578 --> 00:25:40.620]  In fact, they told Border Patrol not to shoot back.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.120]  There have been what?
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:41.721]  We're good to go.
[00:26:01.147 --> 00:26:08.529]  That's why every time a border patrol, you know, to be 10 miles on our side of the border, and here come Humvees with U.S.-made M-16s blasting at us.
[00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.030]  The Mexicans also have a German Heckler and Koch.
[00:26:13.111 --> 00:26:15.612]  So it's a serious situation.
[00:26:15.912 --> 00:26:18.272]  But, no, there's no lawsuits by our government against them.
[00:26:18.632 --> 00:26:19.753]  That's all fine and dandy.
[00:26:19.773 --> 00:26:23.234]  They've got a nice drug trade going together with the heroin and cocaine for your children.
[00:26:23.714 --> 00:26:25.495]  Just let them go ahead and blast.
[00:26:27.384 --> 00:26:28.185]  Our officers.
[00:26:28.465 --> 00:26:33.872]  And then our officers will go out and arrest citizens on their own ranches, arresting illegals.
[00:26:34.333 --> 00:26:40.801]  People on ranches who are being robbed and raped and killed are now stopping them at gunpoint on their own property, calling police.
[00:26:40.821 --> 00:26:42.624]  The police show up and arrest citizens.
[00:26:43.217 --> 00:26:51.139]  The police are, how dare you try to save us, let them kill us, and you see the cops unbuttoning their shirts going, please, shoot me, to the Mexican troops.
[00:26:51.159 --> 00:26:53.460]  I mean, I'm being sarcastic there, but that's what they're doing.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:27:00.122]  They're coming and arresting citizens who defend their property, and Mexico suing us because there wasn't enough water stations for them.
[00:27:01.743 --> 00:27:02.463]  I'm not kidding.
[00:27:02.543 --> 00:27:03.163]  Here it is.
[00:27:03.223 --> 00:27:04.803]  This is mainstream news.
[00:27:04.863 --> 00:27:09.545]  The Arizona Republic online, being updated right now, out in fullwars.com.
[00:27:11.144 --> 00:27:13.386]  We used to update InfoWars by 11 a.m.
[00:27:13.427 --> 00:27:13.887]  Central.
[00:27:13.987 --> 00:27:22.576]  Now it's usually about noon or later because, well, the site's about double the publishing, twice the size and more information for you daily.
[00:27:22.636 --> 00:27:26.621]  So always hit refresh around noon so you can get all these articles.
[00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:28.603]  A lot of them are already posted, though.
[00:27:30.448 --> 00:27:32.390]  Continuing, does that make you angry?
[00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.954]  Halliburton linked to deals with Axis of Evil, Washington.
[00:27:36.334 --> 00:27:39.637]  Halliburton, the oil services titan, once headed by U.S.
[00:27:39.697 --> 00:27:44.982]  Vice President Dick Cheney, businesses in Iran, Iraq, and Libya for years, despite U.S.
[00:27:45.042 --> 00:27:48.666]  embargoes, according to documents released by Henry Waxman, a member of the U.S.
[00:27:48.706 --> 00:27:49.527]  House of Representatives.
[00:27:50.107 --> 00:27:51.849]  Okay, we covered this three years ago.
[00:27:51.869 --> 00:27:54.751]  I heard Dave and Joyce cover it months ago and years ago.
[00:27:54.871 --> 00:27:56.732]  I've covered it up and down, over and over.
[00:27:57.012 --> 00:28:00.815]  We posted it on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:28:02.156 --> 00:28:06.039]  You know why they love the 12-year embargo against Saddam Hussein?
[00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:14.766]  Because only a few companies were allowed in that embargo to sell oil, oil, food, medicine, and weapons systems to Saddam.
[00:28:15.006 --> 00:28:15.887]  And guess who they were?
[00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:17.451]  U.S.
[00:28:17.711 --> 00:28:18.271]  companies.
[00:28:18.431 --> 00:28:19.312]  Yes, that's right.
[00:28:19.792 --> 00:28:22.274]  No one could sell to them but the globalists.
[00:28:23.174 --> 00:28:30.720]  And there was this big fight and squabble where the French would break the blockade through Syria and sell some of the goodies to them.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:39.686]  But here it is from the House of Representatives out in the open that you've got... Who's aiding the Axis of Evil?
[00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:42.908]  Who gives nuclear reactors to North Korea?
[00:28:44.446 --> 00:28:59.669]  Well, ABB board member Rumsfeld, involved in the sale, who gives the sarin and VX nerve gas in the mid-80s right up to the 90s and the botulism in West Nile and the rest of it to Saddam Hussein, the U.S.
[00:28:59.809 --> 00:29:03.750]  government with private companies over and over and over and over again.
[00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.231]  Senate report by Republicans in 99.
[00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:08.751]  Who attacked the Serbs to get them to strike back?
[00:29:09.032 --> 00:29:10.732]  Bin Laden with the CIA report.
[00:29:11.879 --> 00:29:14.281]  In 99, as he's supposedly blowing up U.S.
[00:29:14.341 --> 00:29:17.603]  bases in Saudi Arabia every time the government needs a distraction.
[00:29:18.484 --> 00:29:26.389]  And this is mainstream news, business report, a new congressional study out by Republicans and Democrats.
[00:29:26.829 --> 00:29:27.510]  Here it is.
[00:29:28.631 --> 00:29:37.156]  Only one person allowed to sell oil well equipment to Saddam, and that's Dick Cheney, the vice president, CEO of Halliburton, 1995 to 2000.
[00:29:37.277 --> 00:29:37.777]  We'll come back.
[00:29:42.038 --> 00:29:49.560]  With Jeff Singer and Dave Moore from KCS in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado, where we're on.
[00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:51.581]  Hey, WYD 1580 AM.
[00:29:51.601 --> 00:29:57.683]  We're going to come back and talk to these guys about being suspended for playing the Dixie Chicks.
[00:29:57.723 --> 00:29:58.343]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.044 --> 00:30:00.944]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.424 --> 00:30:03.045]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.965 --> 00:30:06.666]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.702 --> 00:30:11.503]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[00:30:11.703 --> 00:30:14.565]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[00:30:14.805 --> 00:30:16.626]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:30:16.946 --> 00:30:18.306]  Rates are low right now.

[00:30:39.395 --> 00:30:47.221]  All right, folks, thanks again for joining us.
[00:30:47.421 --> 00:30:48.322]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:48.502 --> 00:30:52.525]  I'm here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:30:52.965 --> 00:30:53.745]  until 2 p.m.
[00:30:53.805 --> 00:30:57.728]  Central Standard Time, and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:30:58.229 --> 00:31:05.614]  We're on the radio on the AM and FM dial from Northern California to Washington, D.C., from Pensacola, Florida to Rochester, New York.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:20.424]  We also simulcast at Infowars.com, Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com, and on Global Shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 9320, and from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 6890.
[00:31:20.865 --> 00:31:31.128]  This show is about real conservatism, real liberty, not the George Bush brand of gun confiscation and Clinton on steroids.
[00:31:32.116 --> 00:31:37.298]  We're about the First Amendment as well, and that's why we have our next guest on.
[00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:44.541]  Jeff Singer and Dave Moore do a morning show out in Colorado on KCS 102.
[00:31:45.702 --> 00:31:47.343]  And what is their big crime?
[00:31:47.383 --> 00:31:54.986]  Well, they play the Dixie Chicks, and their boss called in and said, you better turn that off right now, and they got suspended for a couple days.
[00:31:55.866 --> 00:31:59.208]  And this is part of the new America, where you air popular music.
[00:31:59.881 --> 00:32:00.401]  We're good to go.
[00:32:24.477 --> 00:32:28.084]  Because of what Natalie Main said about our president over in London.
[00:32:28.465 --> 00:32:30.930]  So it was starting to turn the other way.
[00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:32.694]  Like, can you start to play the chicks?
[00:32:32.754 --> 00:32:34.538]  And we had requests for them and everything, Phil.
[00:32:34.847 --> 00:32:41.793]  But we decided, for our troops, 100%, we're for the President, 100%, but we're also for the First Amendment, 100%.
[00:32:42.634 --> 00:32:44.796]  Should Natalie Mains of the Dixie Chicks say what she said?
[00:32:45.076 --> 00:32:46.557]  Absolutely not.
[00:32:46.897 --> 00:32:54.604]  Well, wait, America, I mean, in America, you've got the First Amendment, that's what the military's for, is to defend our constitutional republic.
[00:32:54.984 --> 00:33:07.311]  And just this whole blacklisting, this whole demonization of the Dixie Chicks over this has sent shockwaves across the country, a giant chilling effect, and America's going in the wrong direction here.
[00:33:07.931 --> 00:33:08.591]  They really are.
[00:33:08.611 --> 00:33:10.652]  It's about the music.
[00:33:10.952 --> 00:33:14.014]  Natalie's not a foreign policy expert, and neither are we.
[00:33:14.434 --> 00:33:16.775]  And it's just about entertainment.
[00:33:16.875 --> 00:33:21.558]  And like you said, that's why the troops are in Iraq, to give the people there entertainment.
[00:33:22.068 --> 00:33:22.868]  Freedom of speech.
[00:33:23.188 --> 00:33:30.230]  Here at KCS, one of the most in Colorado Springs, we listen to our listeners, and the listeners said they didn't want to play it, so we listened.
[00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:34.791]  Well, that's good, but I do want you guys to go back and get on the radio and go, you can tune into Alex Jones at 1580.
[00:33:34.851 --> 00:33:36.232]  Will you do that for me?
[00:33:36.592 --> 00:33:38.532]  No, seriously, guys.
[00:33:38.752 --> 00:33:40.673]  Getting back into this information.
[00:33:42.009 --> 00:33:45.651]  Now, I have read that, is your station Clear Channel?
[00:33:46.011 --> 00:33:46.312]  No.
[00:33:46.572 --> 00:33:51.695]  Okay, I mean, I heard you on David Joyce's show the other day, and I actually read this and see some news stories.
[00:33:52.115 --> 00:33:56.838]  Clear Channel, a big part of their business isn't just playing music, it's putting on concerts.
[00:33:57.378 --> 00:34:02.741]  Is it true from what you know that Clear Channel is actually involved in promoting Dixie Chicks concerts?
[00:34:03.593 --> 00:34:07.496]  I don't know if they are the promoter behind the Dixie Chicks concerts or not.
[00:34:07.537 --> 00:34:19.367]  I know they have several venues across the country, including a couple in Colorado, and they have Clear Channel Entertainment, which promotes concerts, but I'm not sure if they're one of the promoters for the Chicks or not.
[00:34:19.447 --> 00:34:21.649]  Have the Dixie Chicks played at their venues?
[00:34:24.436 --> 00:34:27.659]  Well, their venue in Colorado is fairly small, though.
[00:34:27.779 --> 00:34:31.483]  The Dixie Chicks will be playing at the Pepsi Center, which is a large venue.
[00:34:31.503 --> 00:34:33.805]  That's where the Nuggets and the Avalanche play.
[00:34:34.125 --> 00:34:36.207]  Yeah, well, I have read that they've been involved.
[00:34:36.567 --> 00:34:40.291]  So could it be a larger publicity stunt where they get all this attention?
[00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:45.395]  I guess we won't know, but, you know, on radio, people do pull stunts, and we're trying to find that out.
[00:34:45.635 --> 00:34:47.177]  So what did your boss say to you?
[00:34:47.197 --> 00:34:50.380]  I mean, why did you decide to go ahead and air the Dixie Chicks?
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:35:03.665]  Well, we figured after two months, we hadn't played them for two months, and the Thursday before we did this, President Bush had said the Warner Rock was all but over, and ironically, that's when the Dixie Chicks started their concert tour that Thursday night.
[00:35:04.085 --> 00:35:11.008]  And I just offhandedly mentioned to Jeff off the air when we were in the control room by ourselves, you know what we should do is just play a bunch of Dixie Chicks music.
[00:35:11.368 --> 00:35:16.710]  And so we got back to each other over the weekend, and Sunday night we kind of decided, yeah, we're going to do this, and so...
[00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.211]  Monday morning, we locked the doors and started it.
[00:35:19.231 --> 00:35:21.332]  A radical move, man!
[00:35:21.733 --> 00:35:26.235]  Playing an all-girl band, singing bluegrass hillbilly music.
[00:35:26.535 --> 00:35:28.316]  Yeah, back-to-back-to-back for six hours.
[00:35:29.177 --> 00:35:31.578]  You like the new album, kind of that bluegrass stuff?
[00:35:32.058 --> 00:35:32.398]  I do.
[00:35:32.519 --> 00:35:32.879]  I love it.
[00:35:32.899 --> 00:35:33.719]  Good sound, yeah.
[00:35:33.779 --> 00:35:36.281]  I like bluegrass better than the fake country stuff they got.
[00:35:36.941 --> 00:35:39.322]  Now, a side issue here.
[00:35:41.543 --> 00:35:46.007]  Now has... I mean, are you allowed to play the Dixie Chicks now, or is there still a ban on that?
[00:35:46.288 --> 00:35:47.088]  No, we are allowed.
[00:35:47.108 --> 00:35:51.392]  They are back in regular rotation, and so we are... Mission accomplished.
[00:35:51.512 --> 00:35:52.754]  ...allowed to play them.
[00:35:54.015 --> 00:35:56.457]  So how did your boss call in and kick you off?
[00:35:56.497 --> 00:35:59.039]  He just said, get off the air, or what happened?
[00:35:59.059 --> 00:35:59.980]  20 minutes till 12.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.462]  He called and said, put me on the air.
[00:36:01.482 --> 00:36:02.803]  I said, okay, we have a minute and a half.
[00:36:02.863 --> 00:36:04.905]  He went and he said, okay, guys, you got two choices.
[00:36:05.385 --> 00:36:05.745]  We're good to go.
[00:36:32.363 --> 00:36:35.464]  We support Natalie Mains' right to say whatever she wants.
[00:36:35.504 --> 00:36:39.006]  So, since you said it, we don't agree with what you said by any means.
[00:36:39.026 --> 00:36:40.006]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:36:40.106 --> 00:36:43.828]  You say that you guys supported, then, the takeover of Iraq.
[00:36:45.688 --> 00:36:47.709]  Well, you know, we support our troops.
[00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.651]  And it's hard to say whether we're there, because I don't know...
[00:36:52.506 --> 00:37:01.333]  You know, personally, whether or not there are weapons of mass destruction and whether there's a necessity to do what is being done, I'm not an expert on that.
[00:37:01.353 --> 00:37:02.614]  But you're supporting the troops.
[00:37:02.634 --> 00:37:05.116]  We support the troops, absolutely.
[00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:15.664]  Wouldn't you say it supports the troops not to sell Saddam, VX, and Sarin and then order our troops to blow up the bunkers and then when they breathe that stuff in 91 and not give them treatment?
[00:37:15.684 --> 00:37:17.125]  Because that's a big deal.
[00:37:17.205 --> 00:37:18.826]  That really hurt the troops right there.
[00:37:19.427 --> 00:37:19.687]  Oh, that's...
[00:37:20.629 --> 00:37:21.149]  That's true.
[00:37:21.169 --> 00:37:26.173]  Of course, we're just country DJs, and for us, it's about the music, mainly.
[00:37:26.534 --> 00:37:27.314]  That's why we did it.
[00:37:27.334 --> 00:37:29.636]  Yeah, but now you've gotten into all this political stuff.
[00:37:29.676 --> 00:37:30.737]  Isn't it more fun?
[00:37:31.157 --> 00:37:34.600]  Well, kind of, sort of, but when we talk to guys like you, we're lost.
[00:37:36.581 --> 00:37:47.690]  I've been doing this for most of my life, if not all of it, and so has my partner, but, you know, we play a lot of music, we do comedy, we do news, we do traffic, we do sports, we entertain people, and we miss the Dixie Chicks, and
[00:37:48.095 --> 00:37:49.036]  We took it upon ourselves.
[00:37:49.056 --> 00:37:50.677]  We're very grateful that we have a job now.
[00:37:50.977 --> 00:37:55.041]  We went in thinking, well, you know, if we get fired, we get fired for something we believe in.
[00:37:55.061 --> 00:37:55.581]  Let's go in.
[00:37:55.961 --> 00:38:01.806]  So this wasn't a deal where the program director called you in and says, Jeff, Dave, I've got an idea here.
[00:38:02.006 --> 00:38:02.206]  No.
[00:38:02.467 --> 00:38:05.069]  You guys go on, play it, I'll suspend you.
[00:38:05.789 --> 00:38:09.352]  Not with the network I'm on, but in just a local radio station.
[00:38:09.632 --> 00:38:12.074]  They tried to get me to pull stuff like that, and I would never do it.
[00:38:12.494 --> 00:38:15.597]  Yeah, no, if you'd have heard the calls that both
[00:38:15.963 --> 00:38:18.577]  Our program director and our general manager made to us...
[00:38:19.468 --> 00:38:22.349]  It was very obvious that they were not happy.
[00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:30.474]  What are your program directors, I mean, are they kind of political officers then of the state, kind of commissars, or what's going on?
[00:38:30.634 --> 00:38:43.740]  No, really what we did and what they did was they, you know, we have five military bases in the Colorado Springs area, and so the wind of opinion was to lay low on playing the Dixie Chicks because of what Natalie said.
[00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:48.523]  Now, I don't think her management handled it as well as they could have because
[00:38:49.167 --> 00:38:52.250]  Pearl Jim certainly didn't see any repercussions for what they did.
[00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:53.792]  Yeah, but look at this mindset.
[00:38:53.912 --> 00:38:56.755]  Well, it's a country and people would expect a country to be more conservative.
[00:38:57.055 --> 00:38:58.577]  You know, the fake type conservative stuff.
[00:38:58.937 --> 00:39:02.140]  Not the real conservatism that will keep our Second Amendment.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.362]  But, you know, looking at this...
[00:39:05.806 --> 00:39:08.568]  Again, I go back to the big fat chilling effect here.
[00:39:09.048 --> 00:39:22.738]  People should love liberty and love free speech enough to not act like Russians or communist Chinese and freak out when somebody disagrees with the president because that's one of the most patriotic things you can do is dissent.
[00:39:22.778 --> 00:39:24.079]  That's what America's all about.
[00:39:24.419 --> 00:39:27.541]  So this whole mindset of, oh, let's not ruffle feathers.
[00:39:27.842 --> 00:39:28.782]  We're in a war.
[00:39:29.323 --> 00:39:30.744]  We don't need to see that happen.
[00:39:30.784 --> 00:39:33.906]  That's the point I'm making, and I'm glad that your program director...
[00:39:34.726 --> 00:39:38.687]  And your general manager rethought their mindset, Jeff and Dave.
[00:39:38.987 --> 00:39:39.707]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:39:39.727 --> 00:39:40.627]  You guys have fun.
[00:39:40.867 --> 00:39:42.108]  Thanks for having us on your show.
[00:39:42.388 --> 00:39:43.888]  We'll see you later, guys.
[00:39:43.988 --> 00:39:47.809]  Be sure and go over there now and plug 1580 since you're plugging your station.
[00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:50.429]  But our listeners are going to stay right here.
[00:39:50.449 --> 00:39:50.889]  I know that.
[00:39:50.909 --> 00:39:54.250]  I went, oh, yeah, we've got an affiliate there.
[00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.831]  That happens more and more now when I have other talk show hosts on.
[00:39:56.851 --> 00:39:58.531]  I want to have somebody on from...
[00:39:59.654 --> 00:40:09.803]  A lot of big cities and middle-sized towns now, I usually don't do it because somebody else is on there, but we've got to get the news out, and that's the number one thing, so that's what we do here.
[00:40:11.004 --> 00:40:11.285]  I don't know.
[00:40:11.325 --> 00:40:14.488]  Local stations break the rules around here and have me on routinely.
[00:40:15.969 --> 00:40:16.569]  Oh, boy.
[00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:22.154]  Now, there is a bunch of different news articles I want to cover, but I also want to take your calls.
[00:40:22.895 --> 00:40:24.757]  But with this whole thing going with the economy...
[00:40:25.783 --> 00:40:28.364]  Mark, can you call and see if we can get Michael Haga on?
[00:40:28.404 --> 00:40:32.806]  I just thought of this during the last break, and every now and then I tell my producer, Mark, maybe you can get Michael Haga on.
[00:40:32.826 --> 00:40:34.927]  I know we have him on so much, you've got the number there on the computer.
[00:40:35.547 --> 00:40:37.328]  Our economist, our best-selling author.
[00:40:37.918 --> 00:40:39.619]  Because I want to talk about this plunging dollar.
[00:40:39.639 --> 00:40:40.639]  This is really serious.
[00:40:40.659 --> 00:40:43.601]  We've been talking about this for, I don't know, as long as I've been on the radio.
[00:40:43.661 --> 00:40:44.682]  It's the globalist plan.
[00:40:44.702 --> 00:40:56.428]  But the last three and a half years, I've been in a bone-chilled position when I think about this because the globalists said they were going to implode our economy and implode our currency, and folks, they're doing it right now.
[00:40:56.468 --> 00:40:57.468]  And I've got news for you.
[00:40:57.828 --> 00:40:59.169]  This is not a good thing.
[00:40:59.189 --> 00:41:03.912]  So I'm going to try to get Michael Haga on today to get his analysis of this.
[00:41:03.992 --> 00:41:06.473]  As far as the moment, we'll see if we're even able to contact him.
[00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:09.725]  I know Ted, the boss, may have his cell phone number.
[00:41:09.785 --> 00:41:10.866]  We can't get it off his home number.
[00:41:12.527 --> 00:41:14.768]  What do you think about all the news we've covered so far?
[00:41:14.808 --> 00:41:15.949]  The really important stuff.
[00:41:17.069 --> 00:41:25.074]  This Dixie Chick stuff really is a diversion up until the point that I saw national television shows talking to the man on the street saying, kill them.
[00:41:25.654 --> 00:41:27.075]  And at that point I had to talk about it.
[00:41:27.135 --> 00:41:28.396]  Again, I saw this old woman.
[00:41:29.096 --> 00:41:32.078]  Thanks to the listener that sent me the NBC show because I didn't see it live.
[00:41:32.938 --> 00:41:33.699]  And I pop it in.
[00:41:33.739 --> 00:41:34.619]  I'd heard about this.
[00:41:34.739 --> 00:41:36.080]  I'd read the transcript.
[00:41:36.796 --> 00:41:38.517]  And man on the street, make them leave.
[00:41:38.577 --> 00:41:39.617]  Throw them out of the country.
[00:41:39.677 --> 00:41:40.597]  Well, you can say that.
[00:41:40.617 --> 00:41:41.117]  That's fine.
[00:41:41.758 --> 00:41:44.359]  Next person, old woman, kill them.
[00:41:44.499 --> 00:41:45.579]  Tie them to a bomb.
[00:41:45.659 --> 00:41:46.939]  Drop them on D.C.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.801]  Or drop them on Baghdad.
[00:41:51.661 --> 00:41:52.441]  Get rid of them.
[00:41:54.042 --> 00:41:55.062]  This is amazing.
[00:41:55.805 --> 00:42:03.908]  Think about that, to have people on NBC television, man on the street, with an old woman saying, if she doesn't like it, she should leave it.
[00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:11.392]  If they don't support this war, tie the lead singer of the Dixie Chicks to a bomb and drop her on Baghdad.
[00:42:12.972 --> 00:42:14.733]  Now that's crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:14.753 --> 00:42:17.554]  That's absolutely out of control.
[00:42:18.394 --> 00:42:21.476]  And you're not going to see police going to arrest that old lady for saying that.
[00:42:21.996 --> 00:42:24.257]  But I guarantee you,
[00:42:25.885 --> 00:42:29.266]  If you threaten your neighbor like that, you'll probably go to jail nowadays.
[00:42:30.027 --> 00:42:31.187]  It's just incredible.
[00:42:31.207 --> 00:42:32.188]  I mean, how many of you saw that?
[00:42:32.208 --> 00:42:44.492]  I don't want to get off into a Dixie Chicks discussion because I never follow what the popular trend is, but no one is talking about television discussions of killing people that disagree with the government.
[00:42:45.873 --> 00:42:48.574]  They're slipping this in there very, very cunningly.
[00:42:50.015 --> 00:42:54.537]  Again, I've talked about another national talk show host on radio, has a show on MSNBC on the weekend.
[00:42:55.017 --> 00:42:58.199]  He says on his website, on the air, I never listened to the guy.
[00:42:58.259 --> 00:43:03.981]  I've tuned in like five times, heard him three times say, must be all he says, anybody that disagrees with the government,
[00:43:04.798 --> 00:43:07.361]  First it was send them to a forced labor camp.
[00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:12.927]  Now it's line them up and shoot them, beat them, tells his listeners to go attack people on the streets.
[00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:15.090]  Well, we don't call for that here.
[00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:20.576]  We don't agree with Bill Clinton trying to sell out our borders, our sovereignty, and disarm us.
[00:43:21.221 --> 00:43:25.203]  We don't agree with President Bush trying to disarm us and sell out our country.
[00:43:25.643 --> 00:43:29.685]  We don't agree with what the government's doing, but we call for peacefully fixing things.
[00:43:30.285 --> 00:43:38.449]  On the other side of the equation, we have the globalists and their mouthpieces calling for this, and it's scary.
[00:43:39.702 --> 00:43:42.724]  The good news is people have a memory of liberty and freedom.
[00:43:43.084 --> 00:44:01.696]  There is a massive backlash, not from the mindless liberals who just know how to chant in a drum circle, but from real conservatives, libertarians, and Christians who are very upset, who've taken time out to read Patriot Act, who've taken time out to read the gun bills the Republicans are trying to pass.
[00:44:03.385 --> 00:44:04.586]  And I have the articles here.
[00:44:05.167 --> 00:44:07.188]  Democrats praise Bush.
[00:44:07.228 --> 00:44:08.810]  Democrats ally with Bush.
[00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:11.212]  Democrats push for more gun control with Bush.
[00:44:12.012 --> 00:44:19.558]  I will remind you, it was Barbara Boxer, the senator from California, who said we need to arm all the pilots.
[00:44:20.139 --> 00:44:27.445]  Better to arm the pilots than to have an F-16 shoot one down a jumbo jet over a major city.
[00:44:28.283 --> 00:44:29.843]  This makes perfect sense, she said.
[00:44:30.223 --> 00:44:35.905]  This is a woman who's called for banning the civilian ownership of firearms, saying arm all the pilots.
[00:44:36.045 --> 00:44:37.965]  Bush says arm none of them.
[00:44:38.485 --> 00:44:46.867]  Massive conservative backlash last year, so they had to pass the compromise for the small percentage are armed if they can jump through 100 hoops.
[00:44:49.127 --> 00:44:50.427]  Okay, so think about that.
[00:44:50.948 --> 00:44:57.829]  Barbara Boxer, more conservative, and this morning I'm listening to a national talk show host as I drive in my car in traffic
[00:44:58.422 --> 00:45:01.403]  And the guy says, you've got to really commend Bush, though.
[00:45:01.483 --> 00:45:05.644]  I don't agree with him on the gun issue, trying to ban the guns, but you've got to agree with him.
[00:45:06.224 --> 00:45:12.086]  You've got to commend him for saying he'd ban guns in his election bid and for doing it now.
[00:45:12.226 --> 00:45:18.408]  He actually said that and then said, and besides, guns are not an absolute right.
[00:45:19.048 --> 00:45:23.569]  Right out of HCI's very handbook.
[00:45:26.238 --> 00:45:27.759]  Now that is amazing.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:33.284]  And so if you're tuned into this show for the first time as a conservative, and you go, what's this guy talking about bashing Bush?
[00:45:33.324 --> 00:45:34.465]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:45:34.806 --> 00:45:37.608]  Do I have to list campaign finance reform again?
[00:45:37.928 --> 00:45:39.810]  Restricting the first of them before elections.
[00:45:40.371 --> 00:45:43.133]  Getting rid of all restrictions on supercomputers in communist China.
[00:45:43.633 --> 00:45:45.275]  Nuclear reactors in North Korea.
[00:45:45.315 --> 00:45:46.336]  Continuing that deal.
[00:45:47.283 --> 00:45:47.964]  Opening the borders.
[00:45:47.984 --> 00:45:48.544]  I already said that.
[00:45:48.564 --> 00:45:49.365]  That's one of the big ones.
[00:45:49.645 --> 00:45:50.506]  The gun grabbing.
[00:45:50.546 --> 00:45:53.249]  Blocking Dan Burton's committee on Pardon Gate.
[00:45:53.609 --> 00:45:59.274]  Bill Clinton pardoning convicted cocaine dealers and convicted money launderers.
[00:45:59.654 --> 00:46:00.375]  Pardoning them.
[00:46:00.415 --> 00:46:01.756]  And Bush says we're not going after him.
[00:46:01.957 --> 00:46:03.138]  We're blocking Dan Burton's committee.
[00:46:03.838 --> 00:46:18.048]  I could go on for hours, doubling the size of the Department of Education, tripling the size of BATF, creating the biggest federal bureaucracy ever seen, Homeland Security, annihilating large sections of the Bill of Rights, and the Patriot Act.
[00:46:19.389 --> 00:46:21.591]  I don't want to hear, well, he's better than Al Gore.
[00:46:22.211 --> 00:46:25.414]  If it was Al Gore in there, things would be exactly like they are now.
[00:46:26.198 --> 00:46:28.638]  George Bush, Al Gore, don't run anything.
[00:46:28.959 --> 00:46:30.319]  They're titular heads.
[00:46:30.919 --> 00:46:34.660]  I mean, I can't even hardly run my own little life, and you know you can't.
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:42.421]  Presidents are told what to say, given teleprompter messages, given drills on what to say and do.
[00:46:42.941 --> 00:46:44.101]  They're figureheads.
[00:46:44.161 --> 00:46:53.403]  But those neocons in Pennsylvania Avenue, in the White House, and in sconce there in the Beltway, I mean, we just had...
[00:46:54.537 --> 00:47:08.186]  A top scholar on, writer for World Net Daily and major newspapers, Dr. Cuddy, who worked in the Department of Education, who was groomed by the neocons, to tell you the history of Crystal and the rest of them.
[00:47:08.647 --> 00:47:13.750]  Trotskyites admitted, their daddies admitted Trotskyites.
[00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:19.034]  Trotskyites, you don't get any more big government than that.
[00:47:19.774 --> 00:47:21.936]  By the way, the LA Times, never thought I'd see it.
[00:47:23.437 --> 00:47:34.545]  Admitting that McCarthy was right and that the KGB files that were released five years ago, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, it was twice as bad, doubly worse than what McCarthy said.
[00:47:35.466 --> 00:47:37.428]  And when did McCarthy get shot down?
[00:47:37.968 --> 00:47:41.030]  When McCarthy said, wait, there's something bigger than communism here.
[00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:45.253]  There's a group above them, international bankers.
[00:47:45.414 --> 00:47:46.214]  He gave speeches.
[00:47:46.795 --> 00:47:48.336]  New world order.
[00:47:48.396 --> 00:47:51.198]  He said the army is arming the Stalinists.
[00:47:51.558 --> 00:47:52.639]  And when he did that, just...
[00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:54.130]  Boom!
[00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.991]  He was shot down immediately.
[00:47:57.012 --> 00:48:03.554]  When McCarthy was just going after some mindless liberal and setting up command and control, he was okay.
[00:48:03.574 --> 00:48:06.756]  It's incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:06.796 --> 00:48:07.616]  So I got that L.A.
[00:48:07.656 --> 00:48:09.857]  Times story as well on Infowars.com.
[00:48:09.877 --> 00:48:10.837]  We'll take your calls.
[00:48:10.857 --> 00:48:11.498]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:48:11.518 --> 00:48:11.558]  800-259-9231.
[00:48:20.535 --> 00:48:26.744]  But it is scary when you've got people on TV saying strap the Dixie Chicks to a bomb and drop them on Baghdad.
[00:48:26.784 --> 00:48:27.385]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:37.462]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:48:37.782 --> 00:48:39.143]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:48:39.363 --> 00:48:41.563]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:48:41.703 --> 00:48:43.804]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:48:44.084 --> 00:48:48.986]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:48:49.346 --> 00:48:53.367]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:48:53.627 --> 00:48:55.408]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:48:55.488 --> 00:49:06.134]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:49:06.295 --> 00:49:08.176]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:49:08.376 --> 00:49:12.238]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:49:12.338 --> 00:49:13.779]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[00:49:31.221 --> 00:49:35.702]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:49:36.062 --> 00:49:40.163]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:40.443 --> 00:49:40.984]  We listened.
[00:49:41.304 --> 00:49:46.285]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:46.565 --> 00:49:47.045]  We listened.
[00:49:47.425 --> 00:49:50.466]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:50.886 --> 00:49:51.426]  We listened.
[00:49:51.886 --> 00:49:54.547]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping
[00:49:56.318 --> 00:49:56.818]  We listened.
[00:49:57.159 --> 00:50:02.401]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:50:02.801 --> 00:50:04.182]  Again, we listened.
[00:50:04.522 --> 00:50:11.906]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:50:12.306 --> 00:50:16.608]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium.
[00:50:21.796 --> 00:50:23.558]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:50:24.198 --> 00:50:27.681]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:50:31.104 --> 00:50:37.029]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:50:37.269 --> 00:50:39.511]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:53.659]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:51:53.679 --> 00:51:54.899]  We're about to go to your calls.
[00:51:54.959 --> 00:51:57.120]  Joe Myron and others that are patiently holding.
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:04.322]  Before I do that, Police State 3 total enslavements now out is 2 hours and 37 minutes long.
[00:52:04.342 --> 00:52:07.782]  2 hours and 37 minutes long.
[00:52:07.902 --> 00:52:10.283]  And on the website we say shipping in one week.
[00:52:10.303 --> 00:52:11.523]  Well, that was 3 or 4 days ago.
[00:52:11.543 --> 00:52:13.744]  We'll be shipping these out in the middle of next week.
[00:52:14.184 --> 00:52:15.004]  Maybe even earlier.
[00:52:15.064 --> 00:52:16.104]  We're mass producing them.
[00:52:16.124 --> 00:52:18.045]  Got them in stock now.
[00:52:18.085 --> 00:52:19.345]  We're processing the orders.
[00:52:20.217 --> 00:52:22.698]  It is the third installment in the Police State series.
[00:52:22.738 --> 00:52:27.279]  If you haven't seen Police State 2000 or Police State to the Takeover, you need to see the films.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:36.483]  How the government provocateurs terror, how they provocateur riots, the urban warfare training, the Marines training to confiscate your guns, to lock down your cities.
[00:52:36.983 --> 00:52:38.943]  That's in the first two Police State films.
[00:52:39.544 --> 00:52:41.824]  Now there's Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:52:42.264 --> 00:52:43.865]  They're all two hours long.
[00:52:43.885 --> 00:52:47.246]  This one's two hours and 37 minutes long, the longest of the series.
[00:52:47.566 --> 00:52:49.447]  They're all a little over two hours long.
[00:52:51.019 --> 00:52:58.262]  It's a $25.95, professionally produced, one of the best films you'll ever see when it comes to waking folks up in hardcore information.
[00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:04.024]  You are authorized to make copies for non-profit, educational, not-for-sale purposes.
[00:53:05.384 --> 00:53:06.144]  I want you to get them.
[00:53:06.164 --> 00:53:08.385]  I want you to make copies and wake people up.
[00:53:08.445 --> 00:53:16.808]  It's having a massive effect here in the attempt to restore the republic and restore our constitutional republic from the clutches of the New World Order.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.441]  Total Enslavement, a film by myself, Alex Jones.
[00:53:20.841 --> 00:53:23.523]  The greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us.
[00:53:25.123 --> 00:53:29.485]  A scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn to enslave every man, woman, and child.
[00:53:29.525 --> 00:53:35.267]  The United States government at all levels has fallen under the control of the desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[00:53:35.788 --> 00:53:45.952]  The events of September 11th mark the initiation of the final sick push of the Illuminati to consolidate their One World Order and transform Earth into a prison planet.
[00:53:46.562 --> 00:53:47.143]  We're good to go.
[00:54:10.091 --> 00:54:21.019]  The nightmare rise of the Homeland Security dictatorship, Patriot Act 1 and 2, the Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison-style surveillance economy, and much more.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:30.807]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism and how the globalist poses our saviors when, in fact, they are the terrorists.
[00:54:32.683 --> 00:54:33.704]  Make the call.
[00:54:33.924 --> 00:54:35.946]  Get 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny.
[00:54:36.026 --> 00:54:37.247]  Get Masters of Terror.
[00:54:37.447 --> 00:54:41.010]  The film's about September 11th, but detail that like no one else does.
[00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:47.435]  And get Police State 3 Total Enslavement to jam-pack the government-sponsored terrorism being exposed.
[00:54:47.855 --> 00:54:50.597]  The toll-free number to order the films is 1-888-
[00:54:52.839 --> 00:54:52.939]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:54:52.959 --> 00:54:53.900]  Again, that number.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.142]  Operators are standing by 24 hours a day.
[00:54:56.162 --> 00:54:56.342]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:54:56.382 --> 00:55:00.185]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, LAMAR, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:55:21.201 --> 00:55:23.446]  So again, InfoWars.com or net.
[00:55:24.151 --> 00:55:26.393]  Or InfoWars.com or net.
[00:55:26.753 --> 00:55:33.999]  Or PrisonPlanet.com is what I meant to say.
[00:55:34.239 --> 00:55:35.080]  Or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:35.741 --> 00:55:39.764]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[00:55:40.204 --> 00:55:41.025]  So don't wait.
[00:55:41.445 --> 00:55:43.387]  Get in the InfoWar today.
[00:55:43.927 --> 00:55:46.670]  Start waking people up about the nightmare reality.
[00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:51.734]  Because if we're going to go back to sanity and decency and honor and retain our God-given rights...
[00:55:52.294 --> 00:55:54.475]  And have a future for our children.
[00:55:54.795 --> 00:55:57.016]  We've got to expose the New World Order in the films.
[00:55:57.176 --> 00:56:00.417]  And my new book, it's only $12, The Sentence of Tyranny, covers.
[00:56:01.598 --> 00:56:02.138]  We'll be back.
[00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:04.459]  We'll go straight to Joe and Myron and others.
[00:56:05.159 --> 00:56:06.940]  And into all this news, I have it covered.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.800]  More on the economy.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:08.920]  More on the Second Amendment.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.741]  More on SARS.
[00:56:10.821 --> 00:56:11.901]  It's all coming up.
[00:56:11.921 --> 00:56:12.502]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:56:12.522 --> 00:56:15.103]  And the unprecedented corruption by our government in Iraq.
[00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.579]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:56:22.739 --> 00:56:28.384]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:56:28.704 --> 00:56:29.565]  Probably never, right?
[00:56:29.845 --> 00:56:37.833]  Hey, folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.363 --> 00:56:47.003]  Big Brother.
[00:56:47.664 --> 00:56:48.704]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:49.425 --> 00:56:50.525]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.186 --> 00:56:52.006]  You want answers?
[00:56:52.766 --> 00:56:53.687]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.327 --> 00:56:58.129]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.509 --> 00:57:02.631]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:07.174 --> 00:57:08.034]  All right, my friends.
[00:57:08.234 --> 00:57:13.417]  Already into the second hour of this live Friday Worldwide Edition.
[00:57:15.336 --> 00:57:21.600]  Toll-free number to join me on air, wide-open phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:57:22.101 --> 00:57:35.010]  Coming up, Halliburton involved going back years in contracts with Saddam Hussein during the sanctions, aiding the access of evil, and now it's in the mainstream news.
[00:57:36.215 --> 00:57:39.858]  We'll get into the dollar plunging and much, much more.
[00:57:40.519 --> 00:57:42.540]  But right now, let's go to the calls as promised.
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.022]  Let's talk to Joe in Texas.
[00:57:44.082 --> 00:57:44.842]  Joe, you're on the air.
[00:57:44.882 --> 00:57:45.223]  Welcome.
[00:57:45.843 --> 00:57:46.304]  Hey, Alex.
[00:57:47.064 --> 00:57:47.445]  Can you hear me?
[00:57:47.585 --> 00:57:47.985]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:48.185 --> 00:57:48.445]  Okay.
[00:57:49.406 --> 00:57:50.808]  First of all, just a couple of things.
[00:57:51.008 --> 00:57:56.332]  First of all, the name of the promotions company is SFX Entertainment.
[00:57:56.893 --> 00:57:58.554]  It's promoting the Dixie Chicks concerts.
[00:57:58.574 --> 00:58:01.877]  If you go to the website, it comes up Clear Channel Entertainment.
[00:58:02.978 --> 00:58:04.319]  Yeah, I've seen that.
[00:58:04.499 --> 00:58:05.539]  Actually, who was it?
[00:58:05.559 --> 00:58:09.140]  It was Reuters ran an article like two weeks ago on that.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.901]  Yeah, SFX, and it's Clear Channel.
[00:58:12.241 --> 00:58:15.803]  And then they start the ban, which then makes it all go down.
[00:58:15.863 --> 00:58:17.203]  Everybody suddenly wants it.
[00:58:17.663 --> 00:58:19.284]  Then they make more money off of it.
[00:58:19.324 --> 00:58:20.604]  But here's the big scam.
[00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:22.085]  It doesn't matter.
[00:58:22.185 --> 00:58:24.586]  It still creates a chilling effect for everybody else.
[00:58:25.026 --> 00:58:29.888]  Ooh, you better not speak out, because then you'll be banned, and people never even know it was a scam.
[00:58:30.128 --> 00:58:30.368]  Yeah.
[00:58:31.826 --> 00:58:33.547]  Second, I just kind of wanted to gloss over that.
[00:58:33.587 --> 00:58:34.527]  Does that make you mad?
[00:58:34.547 --> 00:58:35.207]  Yeah, it does.
[00:58:35.227 --> 00:58:35.807]  It really does.
[00:58:36.808 --> 00:58:48.412]  This guy I work with, he's best friends with a program director of a clear channel station, and he claims that he was never given a direct order not to play it, but it was kind of the thing that let the community decide.
[00:58:49.852 --> 00:58:50.132]  Yeah.
[00:58:50.352 --> 00:59:00.676]  But anyway, the second thing I want to talk about was on MSNBC.com, they talked about how the United States has, for the first time since the beginning of the Iraq war,
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.100]  They use the term occupying power.
[00:59:03.521 --> 00:59:04.801]  Yeah, I have that AP article.
[00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:06.981]  They've admitted we are the occupying power.
[00:59:07.342 --> 00:59:08.322]  Cholera is spreading.
[00:59:08.402 --> 00:59:09.262]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:59:09.622 --> 00:59:14.223]  Yeah, it's just, you know, I thought we were liberating forces, you know.
[00:59:14.343 --> 00:59:15.704]  Oh, no, they don't get any rights.
[00:59:15.764 --> 00:59:20.245]  They're going to appoint 200 people who then elect.
[00:59:20.325 --> 00:59:23.086]  Again, I appoint who votes, and they vote for me.
[00:59:23.266 --> 00:59:26.087]  And then they vote to give the oil free to Israel.
[00:59:26.447 --> 00:59:27.647]  Come on, folks.
[00:59:28.638 --> 00:59:30.961]  It's crazy just the way things are going.
[00:59:31.122 --> 00:59:33.225]  And what else did I read?
[00:59:33.245 --> 00:59:39.254]  That with the Halliburton thing, now instead of just being...
[00:59:40.547 --> 00:59:49.529]  In charge of cleanup, they're going to be in charge of distributing... Sir, we reported three months ago, during the start of the war... You listen... Oh yeah, I listen all the time.
[00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:52.150]  I'm not saying this like, ooh, we're smart, we're tough.
[00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:53.971]  This is all over the foreign press.
[00:59:54.331 --> 01:00:00.452]  The food catering, the construction, the oil pipelines, everything was to be given to Halliburton from the start.
[01:00:00.872 --> 01:00:03.233]  That's what the $7 million contract listed.
[01:00:03.553 --> 01:00:04.653]  It's just now coming out.
[01:00:04.753 --> 01:00:06.734]  And no bids allowed.
[01:00:06.754 --> 01:00:07.374]  Yeah.
[01:00:08.075 --> 01:00:10.496]  Oh, I remember what I was going to say.
[01:00:10.516 --> 01:00:23.123]  Now that we're talking about lifting the sanctions against Iraq, and part of the UN resolution that they were so gung-ho about says that you're not supposed to take off the sanctions unless they have no weapons of mass destruction.
[01:00:24.044 --> 01:00:26.345]  But yet we keep claiming they do have weapons of mass destruction.
[01:00:27.276 --> 01:00:28.657]  And so they can't lift it.
[01:00:28.677 --> 01:00:29.838]  They'll have to keep it on.
[01:00:29.878 --> 01:00:31.820]  And our government says, oh, we want to take it off.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:38.285]  And the UN says, no, more good cop, bad cop behavior when the UN is bought and paid for bankroll by our government.
[01:00:38.665 --> 01:00:38.866]  Yeah.
[01:00:39.626 --> 01:00:40.667]  Okay, that's all I wanted to say.
[01:00:41.188 --> 01:00:43.269]  Excellent, excellent points, Joe.
[01:00:43.489 --> 01:00:44.290]  Very good points.
[01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:45.711]  Thanks for covering that.
[01:00:45.731 --> 01:00:46.712]  Yeah, I've got the articles here.
[01:00:46.732 --> 01:00:47.633]  I'm going to go over all of them.
[01:00:48.308 --> 01:00:50.969]  The toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:56.992]  But maybe somebody wants to call in about the dollar plunging.
[01:00:57.012 --> 01:00:58.353]  Do you know what that means?
[01:00:58.893 --> 01:01:09.038]  Do you know why you can still buy cheap goods, manufactured goods from overseas, and so have lots of bottles of success even though you have a McDonald's job?
[01:01:09.158 --> 01:01:12.900]  Because the dollar was strong and had powerful buying power.
[01:01:13.952 --> 01:01:15.213]  Not anymore, folks.
[01:01:16.053 --> 01:01:16.754]  Not anymore.
[01:01:17.134 --> 01:01:26.760]  Do you realize this is a plan, publicly, by the World Bank and IMF, and at Davos, they said it, to implode us and bring us into third world control?
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:40.568]  It's all coming up, so stay with me, and we'll talk about, yes, our government, our government, it's not a real government, it's a private banker government, says, oh yeah, it's occupational army, throwing it in your face, training you to accept massive corruption.
[01:01:42.535 --> 01:01:43.116]  We're good to go.
[01:01:57.534 --> 01:01:59.856]  Also a one-year full factory warranty on parts and labor.
[01:02:24.611 --> 01:02:25.332]  All this for only $139.
[01:02:25.372 --> 01:02:25.732]  Call today 877-605-9200.
[01:02:25.752 --> 01:02:25.932]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:02:25.952 --> 01:02:26.232]  Call today.
[01:02:41.917 --> 01:02:49.301]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:54.304]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:54.524 --> 01:03:00.167]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:00.407 --> 01:03:04.949]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:03:05.169 --> 01:03:12.312]  The casual society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:03:12.332 --> 01:03:16.874]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:03:17.034 --> 01:03:19.555]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:03:19.775 --> 01:03:26.478]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:03:26.718 --> 01:03:31.980]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:32.460]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:38.362]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:03:47.523 --> 01:03:55.007]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[01:03:55.227 --> 01:04:02.490]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:06.852]  Potassium iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[01:04:06.852 --> 01:04:07.352]  We're good to go.
[01:04:30.925 --> 01:04:33.988]  Call toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:04:34.688 --> 01:04:36.149]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:38.131]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:04:38.431 --> 01:04:49.140]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.783]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:57.086]  Thanks for tuning in to the show today.
[01:04:57.146 --> 01:04:58.948]  Let's go straight back to the calls.
[01:04:59.088 --> 01:05:00.409]  Myron in South Dakota...
[01:05:01.078 --> 01:05:02.479]  Welcome, sir, to the airwaves.
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:18.910]  You know, Alex, one of the things that really bothers me with conservative talk show hosts, and I'm not accusing you of this, the liberals hate Senator Joseph McCarthy with a passion, but there's so many conservatives who repeat the same leftist lies.
[01:05:20.091 --> 01:05:28.617]  This last Monday, I don't know if you're aware of it, but the Senate finally, after 50 years, decided to release...
[01:05:29.438 --> 01:05:42.547]  All of the files on the executive session of the McCarthy hearings, that these were the executive sessions, over 9,000 pages, and I know C-SPAN has it on their archives.
[01:05:42.747 --> 01:05:47.270]  No, it's on, we posted it on Infowars.com two days ago.
[01:05:47.771 --> 01:05:50.052]  It's reposted today, and the L.A.
[01:05:50.072 --> 01:05:51.894]  Times admits McCarthy was right.
[01:05:51.934 --> 01:05:53.014]  It was worse than he thought.
[01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:54.816]  Oh, I didn't realize you did.
[01:05:55.896 --> 01:05:56.617]  Why didn't you let the...
[01:05:57.429 --> 01:06:03.233]  Listeners know that McCarthy and his committee subpoenaed 635 witnesses.
[01:06:04.034 --> 01:06:13.480]  And before they brought anybody before the committee, they would take that witness, bring them up in front of the executive committee, and tell them what evidence they have.
[01:06:13.962 --> 01:06:17.863]  And let that individual then explain why they did what they did.
[01:06:18.043 --> 01:06:20.384]  And if they say, well, okay, I was naive.
[01:06:20.864 --> 01:06:24.145]  I was involved with the Communist Party, but I'm no longer a member.
[01:06:24.225 --> 01:06:28.145]  And you can read McCarthy saying that, and if they told the truth, he left them alone, yeah.
[01:06:28.366 --> 01:06:28.566]  Right.
[01:06:29.026 --> 01:06:29.786]  Send them on home.
[01:06:30.166 --> 01:06:36.888]  You know, one of the things that McCarthy was chastised so viciously was the case with Annie Lee Moss.
[01:06:37.308 --> 01:06:38.928]  I don't know if you're familiar with that case.
[01:06:39.168 --> 01:06:41.089]  Yeah, let me just stop you for a minute, and I'll let you continue.
[01:06:41.129 --> 01:06:42.129]  For those that don't know...
[01:06:43.658 --> 01:06:47.220]  Stalin had already killed, by the time McCarthy was in, 20 million people.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.561]  They had spies all over the country.
[01:06:51.142 --> 01:06:57.566]  They had the neocons, daddies and mommies, the Trotskyites, that again we've covered here.
[01:06:58.732 --> 01:06:59.613]  We're good to go.
[01:06:59.633 --> 01:07:00.234]  I think?
[01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:17.453]  We're good to go.
[01:07:36.892 --> 01:07:37.553]  It was a discovery.
[01:07:37.573 --> 01:07:38.133]  It was history.
[01:07:38.173 --> 01:07:40.054]  And they had a show about China.
[01:07:40.074 --> 01:07:46.780]  And they had the former liaison, the section chief of the CIA, like an 80-something-year-old man, going, yeah, we put Mao in.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.141]  We thought he was a better force.
[01:07:48.421 --> 01:07:53.525]  Well, I got David Rockefeller in the New York Times saying that in 76 in Mao's obituary.
[01:07:54.511 --> 01:08:03.478]  When he found out the truth that communism was just a creation of the bankers to consolidate and take over countries, that's when they deep-sexted him.
[01:08:03.518 --> 01:08:03.898]  Go ahead.
[01:08:04.338 --> 01:08:09.842]  Well, anyhow, Annie Lee Moss, she denied she was a member of the Communist Party, yet they had the evidence.
[01:08:10.343 --> 01:08:19.209]  They brought her before the committee, and little Annie Lee Moss, a black woman, I believe she worked for the Pentagon, and she worked for one of the different departments, and
[01:08:20.107 --> 01:08:21.128]  What is communism?
[01:08:21.208 --> 01:08:22.569]  I don't even know what communism is.
[01:08:22.609 --> 01:08:24.490]  What's that, some political party?
[01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:26.972]  Just acted completely naive.
[01:08:27.192 --> 01:08:31.535]  Edward R. Murrow and the leftist media just went absolutely bonkers over it.
[01:08:31.775 --> 01:08:34.757]  Condemned him for calling this little old lady a communist.
[01:08:35.197 --> 01:08:43.283]  Well, about four years after this, somebody had got a list of all the members of the Communist Party in the Washington, D.C.
[01:08:43.403 --> 01:08:45.564]  area, and here was Annie Lee Moss.
[01:08:45.584 --> 01:08:49.507]  Well, I mean, obviously, I know the famous, I've seen the film of it,
[01:08:50.362 --> 01:08:55.504]  Well, in her obituary, they admitted she had been virtually a life member of the Communist Party, been working for the party.
[01:08:55.524 --> 01:08:58.645]  But I tell you, with the release of the Black Book on Communism...
[01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:20.955]  And the Nona transcripts.
[01:09:21.976 --> 01:09:26.316]  The evidence is just so overwhelming that McCarthy was right on all of these issues.
[01:09:26.356 --> 01:09:31.457]  Well, McCarthy was actually... The Wall Street Journal said that he underestimated it by half.
[01:09:32.177 --> 01:09:33.297]  It was worse than he thought.
[01:09:33.337 --> 01:09:33.858]  And the L.A.
[01:09:33.878 --> 01:09:36.018]  Times, I'll dig it out here today, the L.A.
[01:09:36.158 --> 01:09:38.958]  Times admits that McCarthy was right.
[01:09:39.539 --> 01:09:44.239]  You know, when he went after George Marshall, he made the speech, America's Retreat from Victory.
[01:09:44.259 --> 01:09:45.500]  I don't know if you ever read that.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.900]  It's put in a book form.
[01:09:48.775 --> 01:09:56.984]  He accused George Marshall and his group of cadres for giving China to the communists.
[01:09:57.765 --> 01:10:00.068]  That's when all hell broke loose.
[01:10:00.248 --> 01:10:04.533]  Which now I'm watching again, two years ago, History Channel.
[01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:19.498]  And the former section chief says, we didn't aid the nationalists, we aided Mao because we thought it would be a stabilizing effect, and look, we've given them most favored trading, permanent status, WTO, most of the factories, the weapons, the missiles.
[01:10:19.778 --> 01:10:21.600]  Yeah, the globalists love China.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.621]  The UN gives them all the awards.
[01:10:24.642 --> 01:10:31.367]  When he really got into trouble is when he started, he wanted to subpoena some of the records of the executive from the Eisenhower administration.
[01:10:31.808 --> 01:10:33.429]  That's where Eisenhower...
[01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:39.674]  Announced an executive privilege, and it seems every president from that time on has been using it.
[01:10:39.754 --> 01:10:40.935]  Well, it's a lot worse than that.
[01:10:40.975 --> 01:10:47.977]  I mean, look, our government from Roosevelt on, I mean, it was Uncle Joe Stalin in the newspaper, people.
[01:10:48.337 --> 01:10:49.037]  Good old Joe.
[01:10:49.237 --> 01:10:50.897]  In fact, thanks for the call.
[01:10:51.417 --> 01:10:52.338]  Great points, Myron.
[01:10:53.578 --> 01:10:57.519]  They've got an aircraft carrier down in Corpus Christi.
[01:10:58.602 --> 01:11:01.183]  And what the Blue Ghost is what they call it.
[01:11:01.763 --> 01:11:05.565]  And I went down there and saw it for the first time with my wife last summer.
[01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:08.146]  And I spent eight hours in this thing.
[01:11:08.626 --> 01:11:10.927]  And the time it opened and the time it closed was amazing.
[01:11:11.527 --> 01:11:18.129]  And in room after room, they would decorate it with newspaper articles from the 1940s, from World War II.
[01:11:21.758 --> 01:11:33.306]  And over and over again, I sat there with my wife reading articles for how great Stalin was, even after the war, and how our government gave him all of Eastern Europe, and it just goes on and on.
[01:11:33.826 --> 01:11:36.949]  Lewis, listening in Maryland on WPLC.
[01:11:36.989 --> 01:11:37.829]  What's going on, Lewis?
[01:11:37.949 --> 01:11:38.870]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:42.307]  I appreciate you being honest and speaking the truth.
[01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:45.849]  All the listeners out there, I got something to drop that they said on the news.
[01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:48.871]  You got some news, tell a little bit of reality, then they drop it off.
[01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:51.012]  But it's about the martial law.
[01:11:51.312 --> 01:11:58.856]  They said last night on Channel Fox News the National Guard will be working with the police in certain areas around different parts of the city.
[01:12:00.436 --> 01:12:07.840]  When I heard you speak about the martial law and that's going to be in effect, how they're going to have control in different areas, I see the reality happening right now.
[01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:12.852]  And it's going to be anti-gun neighborhood raids.
[01:12:12.872 --> 01:12:14.934]  They've been training them for years in sweet neighborhoods.
[01:12:15.574 --> 01:12:22.940]  Anti-liberty, checkpoints, cameras everywhere, satellite tracking, and it's not just going to be the airports, now the roads.
[01:12:23.361 --> 01:12:29.846]  I've got a News 8 piece from Des Moines, Iowa, a year and a half ago, where they go, the troops have been in the airports, now we'll be on the streets.
[01:12:30.166 --> 01:12:32.507]  Yeah, they're already doing it right now in D.C.
[01:12:32.527 --> 01:12:32.947]  and Maryland.
[01:12:32.967 --> 01:12:35.108]  They already mentioned it last night.
[01:12:35.529 --> 01:12:40.991]  They try to make it like it's just in all the bad crime areas, but that's just a lie of the trick.
[01:12:41.171 --> 01:12:43.092]  But now the border is going to be wide open.
[01:12:43.132 --> 01:12:46.734]  But notice, you're saying they said to fight crime, not terror?
[01:12:47.034 --> 01:12:47.314]  Yes.
[01:12:47.715 --> 01:12:48.935]  They said to fight crime.
[01:12:48.955 --> 01:12:49.776]  To fight crime.
[01:12:49.796 --> 01:12:52.517]  Keep crime rates down and people breaking up.
[01:12:52.797 --> 01:12:54.378]  You know, stealing cars and stuff.
[01:12:54.578 --> 01:12:58.541]  They said the National Guard is going to help stop crime.
[01:12:58.561 --> 01:12:58.981]  You're kidding.
[01:12:59.181 --> 01:13:00.102]  Working with the police.
[01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:01.783]  They said this on Channel Fox News.
[01:13:01.843 --> 01:13:05.445]  And also they said that the ones who looked in the Maryland, D.C.
[01:13:05.525 --> 01:13:11.009]  area, they said this last night that Al Qaeda is rebelling again to make another terrorist attack move.
[01:13:11.329 --> 01:13:16.211]  I think that's a trick so they can take more liberties away and blame it on foreign souls or on terrorists.
[01:13:16.491 --> 01:13:17.831]  Incredible points, Lewis.
[01:13:17.851 --> 01:13:20.052]  Spread the word about the show there in the area.
[01:13:20.172 --> 01:13:20.552]  Always.
[01:13:20.632 --> 01:13:21.172]  I got to.
[01:13:21.373 --> 01:13:29.075]  I'm going to fight this New World Order and I hope everyone out there who's listening, who wants to know the truth, who believes in God and justice and equality and freedom will fight this New World Order.
[01:13:29.095 --> 01:13:33.257]  Because this New World Order is living among people and people are getting so caught with brainwash.
[01:13:33.277 --> 01:13:34.217]  They don't know what's going down.
[01:13:34.717 --> 01:13:36.958]  I know about the chips and implantments and things.
[01:13:36.998 --> 01:13:38.839]  Well, they're all over the news saying it.
[01:13:38.859 --> 01:13:40.640]  Just two years ago, you'd be a cook to say it.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:42.380]  Now every channel's saying it's great.
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:45.341]  Is that the local Fox affiliate?
[01:13:45.662 --> 01:13:50.223]  I'm not sure, but I stay up late to listen because I always listen to you and all the listeners.
[01:13:50.684 --> 01:13:53.024]  I always do things to do with you, but I always exert.
[01:13:53.064 --> 01:13:54.305]  But it came on this area.
[01:13:54.345 --> 01:13:57.286]  I don't know how this area works, but I heard it late mentioned last night.
[01:13:57.306 --> 01:14:00.287]  They always mention stuff when they know people's not listening.
[01:14:00.307 --> 01:14:02.188]  They'll say incredible things at 2 in the morning.
[01:14:02.568 --> 01:14:04.129]  And then also, too, on top of this,
[01:14:05.121 --> 01:14:06.041]  I want to find out.
[01:14:06.201 --> 01:14:11.566]  I think sometimes when you come on air, they try to block you out, too, because you hit so much truthful points.
[01:14:12.126 --> 01:14:14.809]  What do you mean they try to block a show?
[01:14:14.829 --> 01:14:16.310]  Well, I know frequencies.
[01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:19.593]  I know other listeners in the area who listen to you at the same hours.
[01:14:19.673 --> 01:14:24.196]  If they listen to you late at night, they can't get you in, too.
[01:14:24.317 --> 01:14:30.662]  It'd be a frequency, and you can hear it, but I don't know if they try to block you out or what, but sometimes I call other people, and they get in the same thing, too.
[01:14:32.966 --> 01:14:34.587]  You can hear us fine during the day, though.
[01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:43.053]  Fine during the day, but at nighttime when people are home and want to listen to the radio, everybody gets the same blackout.
[01:14:43.093 --> 01:14:43.913]  They can't get you in.
[01:14:43.933 --> 01:14:46.575]  Yeah, well, that's probably just because AMs aren't as strong at night.
[01:14:46.855 --> 01:14:47.856]  Listen, thank you for the call.
[01:14:47.896 --> 01:14:49.757]  I appreciate it.
[01:14:49.817 --> 01:14:54.800]  Look, folks, now, it isn't my opinion that the troops are trying to take your guns.
[01:14:55.681 --> 01:14:57.282]  This started 20 years ago.
[01:14:58.681 --> 01:15:02.124]  And it's gone through no matter Republican, Democrat, they're not running anything.
[01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:06.628]  It's the military-industrial complex, what they admit's in control, the shadow government.
[01:15:06.949 --> 01:15:09.050]  The Amber Alert is not the Amber Alert.
[01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:11.072]  It's the EAS system.
[01:15:11.613 --> 01:15:22.583]  They now have anti-gun announcements, quote-report terrorist announcements over the radio, over the big flashing billboards right there in D.C., right here in Texas, in Houston, in San Antonio.
[01:15:22.963 --> 01:15:23.984]  I've seen it on the news.
[01:15:24.773 --> 01:15:37.764]  And I remember four or five years ago going to urban warfare training events and watching Marines with foreign troops train and admit they were training to take our guns right here in America.
[01:15:38.665 --> 01:15:41.207]  And if they're saying that in D.C.
[01:15:41.567 --> 01:15:44.950]  they're going to have troops fighting crime, see, that's what the Patriot Act says.
[01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:50.855]  You don't have any rights if you're a terrorist or if you're involved in crime, crime, crime, or suspected of crime.
[01:15:51.957 --> 01:16:04.361]  And Governor Ridge has said, the new Homeland Security Dictatorship Chief, Security Chief, the new KGB Chief, he has said, we are going to get rid of Posse Comitatus and put troops on the streets.
[01:16:04.781 --> 01:16:06.282]  I saw him on C-SPAN last year.
[01:16:06.342 --> 01:16:15.085]  He said, we're going to have troops in all the factories like in Red Dawn when they go in the grocery store and the military man's walking along in the upstairs watching people.
[01:16:15.985 --> 01:16:18.286]  That is the literal plan.
[01:16:18.746 --> 01:16:20.087]  Troops drug testing you.
[01:16:20.147 --> 01:16:20.907]  It's already started.
[01:16:22.462 --> 01:16:25.125]  In private business, they quote, drop by and get the samples.
[01:16:25.786 --> 01:16:30.671]  Worse than Russia, worse than Germany, but they can't get away with it if we stand up and speak out.
[01:16:31.192 --> 01:16:32.874]  They'll say, well, it's to keep you safe.
[01:16:33.575 --> 01:16:36.438]  Ask the government then, why is the border wide open?
[01:16:37.139 --> 01:16:39.542]  Why are you taking all our liberties with the borders wide open?
[01:16:40.022 --> 01:16:41.124]  We're protecting you.

[01:19:40.012 --> 01:19:48.279]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:52.883]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:53.184 --> 01:20:02.092]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:20:02.292 --> 01:20:05.915]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:20:06.195 --> 01:20:11.243]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:20:11.523 --> 01:20:18.233]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:20:18.743 --> 01:20:19.383]  What about you?
[01:20:20.044 --> 01:20:25.386]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:20:51.392 --> 01:21:07.877]  Last night, I re-read much of a Army field manual, a Swiss Army field manual on guerrilla resistance, and it talked about the tactics of occupying armies.
[01:21:08.832 --> 01:21:33.295]  How they get control of communications, how they first demonize groups in the media, all the different things they do, how they introduce police into the general population, how they say it's to fight crime or to bagel the police, how they incrementally set up total control and despotism, and that is exactly, exactly what's happening now.
[01:21:34.338 --> 01:21:35.479]  Here in the United States.
[01:21:35.699 --> 01:21:46.665]  I mean, in my film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, we document who carried out September 11th, how they did it, how to stop them, what their future plans are, who they are, what they do, what they're all about.
[01:21:47.626 --> 01:22:00.053]  And when I interview a Marine Corps officer who's retired and has a successful business here in Austin, who in 1988 was kicking down doors of gun dealers' homes in areas of Virginia.
[01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.282]  In Norfolk and other areas.
[01:22:02.363 --> 01:22:03.443]  I mean, this has been going on.
[01:22:03.723 --> 01:22:05.624]  They've been in police uniforms for a long time.
[01:22:06.204 --> 01:22:10.505]  They just needed the terror attacks to legitimize all of this, and it's not Alex Jones saying it.
[01:22:11.805 --> 01:22:16.307]  You know, I say Dick Cheney was selling Saddam Hussein stuff throughout the 90s right up until 2000.
[01:22:16.947 --> 01:22:17.967]  It's in Businessweek.
[01:22:18.508 --> 01:22:19.748]  It's in mainstream news.
[01:22:20.808 --> 01:22:29.191]  When I say that bin Laden works for the CIA, we know until 99, attacking the Serbs for the CIA, that's mainstream news, a Senate report.
[01:22:30.825 --> 01:22:36.449]  When I say they're getting ready to put troops on the streets all over the place for greater disasters they're going to engineer, it's obvious.
[01:22:36.489 --> 01:22:37.070]  They're doing it.
[01:22:39.271 --> 01:22:40.612]  And I love America.
[01:22:40.932 --> 01:22:41.933]  I love this country.
[01:22:43.954 --> 01:22:45.696]  I'm not going to sell out to the New World Order.
[01:22:45.776 --> 01:22:47.377]  I'm not going to go along with the New World Order.
[01:22:47.992 --> 01:22:50.133]  Because the New World Order is criminally insane.
[01:22:50.153 --> 01:22:57.417]  The New World Order has been in the ivory towers so long and is so decadent and enjoys just the exercise of power.
[01:22:57.817 --> 01:22:58.817]  No one's in their way.
[01:22:59.078 --> 01:23:02.439]  No one was doing anything to stop them owning us and running our lives.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.941]  But they're setting up a horrible, oppressive system.
[01:23:07.085 --> 01:23:08.305]  Just because they feel like it.
[01:23:08.345 --> 01:23:10.666]  It's what dictatorships always do.
[01:23:10.686 --> 01:23:13.587]  And it's not a dictatorship of Bill Clinton or George Bush.
[01:23:13.607 --> 01:23:15.027]  They're just puppets.
[01:23:15.388 --> 01:23:22.710]  It's a dictatorship of the military-industrial complex that was bankrolled and founded to run this country by the private European banks.
[01:23:23.210 --> 01:23:26.091]  There's no fight between the EU and the UN in America.
[01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:29.052]  It's all owned by the same private shareholders.
[01:23:30.012 --> 01:23:33.033]  The Warburgs, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[01:23:33.982 --> 01:23:41.190]  The Dutch Roll family, the British Roll family, the Bilderberg Group, the people that meet and publicly call for open world dictatorship.
[01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:44.734]  You know, the big German minister just came out and said that and got in a lot of trouble.
[01:23:45.314 --> 01:23:47.437]  More and more people are telling the truth.
[01:23:47.537 --> 01:23:50.480]  More and more people are standing up and getting involved.
[01:23:51.972 --> 01:23:53.934]  And that's what gives us safety, is numbers.
[01:23:54.094 --> 01:23:55.255]  More of us being vocal.
[01:23:55.615 --> 01:23:56.756]  More of us knowing the truth.
[01:23:57.136 --> 01:23:58.297]  More of us speaking out.
[01:23:58.357 --> 01:24:04.422]  You know, if something happened to me tomorrow, there's ten more replacements right behind me and ten more where that came from.
[01:24:04.682 --> 01:24:06.263]  And the same in all of our ranks.
[01:24:06.804 --> 01:24:15.390]  The ranks of people that are freedom lovers, that know the truth, and the spirit of 1776, that want to stop the globalist enemy combatants.
[01:24:15.871 --> 01:24:17.212]  They are the enemy combatants.
[01:24:17.592 --> 01:24:23.155]  The private shadow government that runs America is destroying America right now.
[01:24:24.696 --> 01:24:26.056]  You know, we've got our guns.
[01:24:26.637 --> 01:24:33.260]  We've still got some of our mobility, as they put in the tracking grid and the cameras that scan the driver's license plates and all that.
[01:24:35.021 --> 01:24:37.082]  The satellite kills, which is in all the new cars.
[01:24:37.782 --> 01:24:40.884]  We had our guns, and we put up with all this tyranny being armed.
[01:24:41.664 --> 01:24:44.866]  And I'm telling you, peaceable resistance is the way to win this thing.
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:52.243]  It's like that monster in the comic book that just gets stronger the more you hit it, but there's other ways to defeat it.
[01:24:52.883 --> 01:24:54.744]  I'm not saying don't defend your family against tyranny.
[01:24:54.764 --> 01:24:55.884]  It's a last resort.
[01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:58.446]  That's definitely something that's very important.
[01:24:59.186 --> 01:25:05.369]  But the point here is that we have to get the hearts and minds of the people.
[01:25:06.009 --> 01:25:08.270]  That's where the victory lies.
[01:25:09.090 --> 01:25:10.671]  That's where we're going to get this done.
[01:25:11.813 --> 01:25:15.034]  And you take the firefighters, the police, the health care workers.
[01:25:15.414 --> 01:25:19.475]  They've only vaccinated a couple hundred of them in the 11 largest cities.
[01:25:20.455 --> 01:25:22.195]  20 largest cities, according to the LA Times.
[01:25:23.556 --> 01:25:24.196]  20 largest cities.
[01:25:25.436 --> 01:25:26.656]  A few thousand nationwide.
[01:25:26.676 --> 01:25:28.777]  They plan to already have vaccinated 11 million.
[01:25:28.797 --> 01:25:30.437]  I've got the White House announcements.
[01:25:31.718 --> 01:25:33.458]  The Health and Human Services announcements.
[01:25:35.718 --> 01:25:38.039]  The government said it was good for you, but it wasn't true.
[01:25:39.429 --> 01:25:44.771]  The people refuse, and good thing they did, because it's causing about one in a thousand to die in the military.
[01:25:46.411 --> 01:25:48.912]  Looks like it might have killed the NBC reporter, Bloom.
[01:25:50.393 --> 01:25:56.815]  So they can say they're protecting us from terrorists and saying they're taking all our rights because they love us, but out there, the truth is out there.
[01:25:56.855 --> 01:26:03.557]  People may be afraid to speak up and get involved, but deep down they know the truth, and more of them know the truth every day.
[01:26:04.484 --> 01:26:09.267]  And it just takes that passive resistance to not go along with this system.
[01:26:10.347 --> 01:26:15.870]  Whether you're in the police force in Austin, Texas, or in the Pentagon, don't be an enemy combatant.
[01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:17.851]  Don't aid the terrorists.
[01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:22.973]  Stand up for America, for the United States, for the Bill of Rights.
[01:26:23.494 --> 01:26:25.815]  We have the Northwoods document, the U.S.
[01:26:25.855 --> 01:26:29.777]  government plan, ABC News, to carry out terror, and we know the truth.
[01:26:32.316 --> 01:26:33.256]  We're on the march.
[01:26:33.696 --> 01:26:35.317]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:35.337 --> 01:26:39.038]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.099 --> 01:26:45.120]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:50.361]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:26:50.621 --> 01:26:54.062]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate.
[01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:57.823]  That web address again is calbinpuresoap.com.
[01:26:58.063 --> 01:27:00.904]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:27:07.967 --> 01:27:09.869]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:13.212]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:16.696 --> 01:27:20.960]  The globalists, the liberals, the neocons, whatever you want to call them, they're all the same people.
[01:27:21.461 --> 01:27:22.962]  They're little servants in D.C.
[01:27:24.023 --> 01:27:24.404]  Puppets.
[01:27:25.385 --> 01:27:25.485]  All.
[01:27:26.343 --> 01:27:29.364]  Have said that their window of opportunity is closing and they know it.
[01:27:29.664 --> 01:27:31.844]  They've got to enslave you and dumb you down now.
[01:27:32.404 --> 01:27:39.086]  What is it they have planned so horrible that they know we haven't resisted physically with all the bad things they've done?
[01:27:39.806 --> 01:27:42.966]  Just using their propaganda they've been able to control most of us.
[01:27:43.387 --> 01:27:48.288]  What is it they have planned so horrible they know that we'll resist so they're driving to disarm us?
[01:27:49.148 --> 01:27:54.809]  It's total financial collapse designed by the IMF and World Bank publicly stated to implode everything.
[01:27:56.207 --> 01:27:57.268]  They want control.
[01:27:57.388 --> 01:27:58.168]  Total control.
[01:27:58.248 --> 01:27:59.048]  They want it all.
[01:27:59.168 --> 01:28:00.089]  They want it now.
[01:28:01.069 --> 01:28:02.089]  But it's worse than that.
[01:28:03.210 --> 01:28:05.131]  It's the breakup of the family.
[01:28:05.251 --> 01:28:07.632]  It's the construction of our sovereignty.
[01:28:08.072 --> 01:28:09.993]  They know you're going to get angry.
[01:28:10.353 --> 01:28:11.413]  And so they've prepared.
[01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:12.894]  They've federalized your police.
[01:28:13.394 --> 01:28:16.115]  They're federalizing your cities now under Homeland Security.
[01:28:16.635 --> 01:28:20.577]  They're going right down the line, right out of a handbook of how to overthrow a government.
[01:28:21.167 --> 01:28:23.089]  We're trying to restore the republic.
[01:28:23.389 --> 01:28:26.932]  We're trying to defend America desperately here.
[01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:32.596]  Many people have given their lives in defense of the republic on foreign shores.
[01:28:33.097 --> 01:28:35.258]  They gave their lives in 1776 on the berth.
[01:28:35.559 --> 01:28:38.861]  They gave their lives at the Alamo for liberty.
[01:28:39.642 --> 01:28:41.964]  And it takes people having courage.
[01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:44.886]  You know what type of world it creates when everyone is a coward?
[01:28:45.707 --> 01:28:48.569]  When everyone's afraid just of what their neighbor will think?
[01:28:50.051 --> 01:28:52.113]  Do you know what type of world that creates?
[01:28:52.233 --> 01:28:54.856]  That accelerates tyranny into high positions.
[01:28:55.257 --> 01:29:00.102]  That guarantees a deepening of the degradation and despotism.
[01:29:02.324 --> 01:29:07.350]  I mean, if this was just good old boy corruption, it could be not ignored, but it wouldn't be as desperate.
[01:29:08.391 --> 01:29:11.214]  The globalists are the most sinister people.
[01:29:12.193 --> 01:29:16.334]  Control freaks, the most desperately wicked people you could possibly imagine.
[01:29:16.374 --> 01:29:18.434]  I mean, here's ABC News, folks.
[01:29:18.814 --> 01:29:22.175]  In my book, Ascent to Tyranny, I have a shot of the actual news article.
[01:29:22.875 --> 01:29:23.015]  U.S.
[01:29:23.055 --> 01:29:25.036]  military drafted plans to terrorize U.S.
[01:29:25.056 --> 01:29:26.676]  cities to provoke war.
[01:29:26.696 --> 01:29:33.437]  In the early 1960s, America's top military leaders reportedly drafted plans to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in the U.S.
[01:29:33.477 --> 01:29:35.638]  cities to create public support for war.
[01:29:36.578 --> 01:29:37.838]  For domestic police state.
[01:29:38.487 --> 01:29:43.431]  We have the document, a link to the National Security Archives, on Infowars.com.
[01:29:43.672 --> 01:29:47.735]  And don't worry, it's on 10,000 other websites and hundreds more every day.
[01:29:49.036 --> 01:29:50.157]  We are not going to stop.
[01:29:50.197 --> 01:29:51.739]  We're going to tell everybody the truth.
[01:29:52.499 --> 01:29:54.001]  We're going to get more and more bold.
[01:29:55.001 --> 01:29:58.865]  And we're going to do what it takes to defend the republic, no matter what the cost.
[01:29:59.525 --> 01:30:01.347]  Because we know how evil the globalists are.
[01:30:02.468 --> 01:30:03.409]  Baltimore Sun.
[01:30:04.797 --> 01:30:04.917]  U.S.
[01:30:04.957 --> 01:30:07.219]  terror plan called Cuban Invasion Pretext.
[01:30:07.279 --> 01:30:07.419]  U.S.
[01:30:07.459 --> 01:30:16.526]  military leaders proposed in 1962 a secret plan to commit terrorist acts against Americans and blame Cuba to create a pretext for invasion and ouster of communist leader Fidel Castro, who they put in.
[01:30:16.967 --> 01:30:29.196]  No, they used the war against the communists as a way to warp the minds of our military men and our CIA and get them to do evil things and set up a culture of evil, which is now used for narcotics trafficking and money laundering and white slavery.
[01:30:29.577 --> 01:30:30.958]  Every other evil you can imagine.
[01:30:32.639 --> 01:30:33.600]  And it goes on to talk about
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:03.921]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[01:31:05.822 --> 01:31:09.022]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[01:31:11.043 --> 01:31:15.724]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[01:31:16.464 --> 01:31:19.385]  And they whisper the word, revolution.
[01:31:21.686 --> 01:31:25.767]  There are men coming down from the valleys.
[01:31:27.523 --> 01:31:42.292]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Revolution!
[01:31:44.794 --> 01:31:54.319]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[01:31:56.667 --> 01:31:57.948]  We're good to go.
[01:32:33.138 --> 01:32:35.441]  And wait, get ready for the sign.
[01:32:35.841 --> 01:32:39.265]  There are many here among us now who have not seen the light.
[01:32:39.806 --> 01:32:43.390]  We are saying the word to all the people in the land.
[01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:47.835]  Go to every hill and mountain, for the time is now at hand for life!
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:09.241]  We're good to go.
[01:33:33.752 --> 01:33:56.199]  There is an endless stream, an endless stream of media whores and people that can be bought for 20 pieces of silver and now it's delivered to our country into the most imprisoned, most lowly educated, mindless sports watching group of idiots known on the planet.
[01:33:56.858 --> 01:34:00.501]  America is not America anymore because we sold out.
[01:34:00.942 --> 01:34:04.585]  Now we've got to wake up again and realize the threat, my friends.
[01:34:05.025 --> 01:34:13.332]  As I was saying, I'm down here in Austin, Texas, and the folks with the satellite uplinks are running the show at Minnesota, and occasionally we get disconnected in between our lines.
[01:34:13.372 --> 01:34:14.173]  I think I had a problem.
[01:34:14.193 --> 01:34:19.538]  My answer, we heard that song, but we are back, ladies and gentlemen, here from the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:34:20.482 --> 01:34:24.064]  Again, I'm talking about mainstream Baltimore Sun.
[01:34:24.084 --> 01:34:25.505]  Let me read this for you.
[01:34:26.185 --> 01:34:28.066]  Scott Shane and Tom Bowman.
[01:34:28.086 --> 01:34:28.126]  U.S.
[01:34:29.507 --> 01:34:32.028]  terror plan called invasion pretext.
[01:34:32.148 --> 01:34:33.168]  ABC News.
[01:34:33.829 --> 01:34:34.669]  May 1st.
[01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:36.510]  And it says U.S.
[01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:38.471]  military drafted plans to terrorize U.S.
[01:34:38.491 --> 01:34:39.592]  cities to provoke war.
[01:34:40.272 --> 01:34:42.073]  You see, and what did it call for?
[01:34:42.513 --> 01:34:44.074]  Hijacking jet airliners.
[01:34:45.566 --> 01:34:45.866]  The U.S.
[01:34:45.906 --> 01:34:46.466]  government did.
[01:34:46.566 --> 01:34:47.747]  I'm just reading ABC News.
[01:34:48.247 --> 01:34:49.487]  Not a very radical show.
[01:34:49.968 --> 01:34:54.429]  No, other shows are radical liars and suppressors that not talk about this.
[01:34:55.429 --> 01:35:00.651]  Hijack jet airliners, the crash room full of Americans that attack an enemy to blame it on the enemy.
[01:35:01.311 --> 01:35:05.113]  They wanted to attack the Marines at Guantanamo with Army dressed up like Cubans.
[01:35:05.373 --> 01:35:07.534]  They wanted to have sniper attacks in D.C.
[01:35:08.074 --> 01:35:09.554]  to be blamed on patsies.
[01:35:09.574 --> 01:35:14.356]  It even talks about how to frame the patsies on page 9 of the Northwoods plan.
[01:35:15.123 --> 01:35:16.744]  Some of our military people ought to check out.
[01:35:16.784 --> 01:35:17.824]  You ought to check out what I'm saying.
[01:35:18.764 --> 01:35:22.046]  And it called for carrying out bombing attacks in D.C.
[01:35:22.066 --> 01:35:23.026]  I think that's horrible.
[01:35:23.986 --> 01:35:27.128]  I think that's terrible to attack our nation's capital in that way.
[01:35:27.328 --> 01:35:27.988]  To have the U.S.
[01:35:28.028 --> 01:35:30.389]  government do it, to blame it on foreign enemies.
[01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:36.271]  Here it is, in my book, 9-1-1, The Sentence of Tyranny, has the articles.
[01:35:37.211 --> 01:35:39.292]  The book is 230 pages long.
[01:35:39.332 --> 01:35:40.673]  It's only 12 bucks.
[01:35:41.833 --> 01:35:44.254]  And I'll plug it here in a second, but
[01:35:45.327 --> 01:35:50.789]  You can go to InfoWars.com, to the giant 9-1-1 government prior knowledge involvement section.
[01:35:50.809 --> 01:35:53.330]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.com, to the giant.
[01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:54.890]  It's even bigger there, about three times bigger.
[01:35:54.930 --> 01:35:57.291]  I don't know, 500 news articles, all mainstream.
[01:35:59.072 --> 01:36:00.132]  All the pieces there.
[01:36:01.613 --> 01:36:04.034]  And find out the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:04.134 --> 01:36:05.494]  Find out the reality.
[01:36:05.514 --> 01:36:07.155]  You know, Hitler blew up the Reichstag.
[01:36:07.873 --> 01:36:12.457]  To firebomb it, to get control, to say, oh, the enemy has attacked our capital terrorist.
[01:36:12.477 --> 01:36:13.478]  We must crack down.
[01:36:13.738 --> 01:36:17.381]  Homeland Security Director Herman Goering will keep you safe.
[01:36:17.461 --> 01:36:18.842]  Heinrich Himmler will keep you safe.
[01:36:19.423 --> 01:36:20.704]  They're going to take good care of you.
[01:36:21.544 --> 01:36:26.909]  We know that our own government blew up the Maine in 1898 to get into the Spanish-American War.
[01:36:27.309 --> 01:36:29.291]  We know the Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[01:36:29.311 --> 01:36:30.291]  That's now admitted fact.
[01:36:30.311 --> 01:36:31.252]  Get us into Vietnam.
[01:36:31.773 --> 01:36:32.873]  It's a fraud!
[01:36:33.814 --> 01:36:34.495]  And not only...
[01:36:35.208 --> 01:36:35.929]  Do they do that?
[01:36:35.969 --> 01:36:37.630]  They created the communists.
[01:36:37.670 --> 01:36:38.851]  They funded them publicly.
[01:36:39.211 --> 01:36:40.152]  They funded Hitler.
[01:36:40.192 --> 01:36:41.493]  They funded all of them.
[01:36:43.395 --> 01:36:44.836]  We need to be honest about this.
[01:36:44.876 --> 01:36:45.997]  We need to speak out about this.
[01:36:46.037 --> 01:36:48.519]  We need to stand up for America.
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:54.224]  It hurts my heart to see this country getting torn into a hundred different pieces.
[01:36:54.664 --> 01:37:01.330]  And to see the balkanization, to see them following that globalist manual to balkanize and destroy...
[01:37:03.010 --> 01:37:04.151]  Now, I know we've got loaded phones.
[01:37:04.171 --> 01:37:11.194]  We'll go to Jeff in Missouri and Ron in New York and Rob in Wyoming and Michael in Colorado and many others here in a second.
[01:37:11.214 --> 01:37:13.295]  But let me just run through some news real quick.
[01:37:14.996 --> 01:37:17.497]  Dollar's dissent has currency watchers on the edge.
[01:37:17.537 --> 01:37:22.319]  Again, the dollar has plummeted, and it's not good for the economy because it destroys our buying power.
[01:37:22.339 --> 01:37:23.519]  One of the few things we had left.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.561]  In England, they're putting in the satellite tracking systems to tax shooting their cars.
[01:37:28.182 --> 01:37:31.083]  And headline, old cars face ban from London streets.
[01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:32.070]  U.S.
[01:37:32.110 --> 01:37:33.331]  sued over border deaths.
[01:37:33.992 --> 01:37:40.958]  Mexican government says our government must put water stations in the desert or be sued as their troops kill our federal officers and nothing's done.
[01:37:40.978 --> 01:37:44.701]  Halliburton linked to deals with Axis of Evil business report.
[01:37:45.982 --> 01:37:47.843]  Mainstream News, AFP.
[01:37:48.804 --> 01:37:52.107]  Halliburton, the oil services titan, once headed by U.S.
[01:37:52.147 --> 01:37:56.050]  Vice President Dick Cheney, business in Iran, Iraq, and Libya for years.
[01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.850]  Despite U.S.
[01:37:56.890 --> 01:38:00.233]  embargoes, according to documents released by Henry Waxman, a member of the U.S.
[01:38:00.253 --> 01:38:01.074]  House of Representatives.
[01:38:02.256 --> 01:38:03.717]  And it's a fact, folks.
[01:38:04.097 --> 01:38:09.979]  During the sanctions, only a few people could sell stuff to Saddam, and one of them was Dick Cheney.
[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:13.901]  Now he gets a $7 million contract, no bids allowed in Iraq.
[01:38:15.482 --> 01:38:26.727]  A letter from Waxman obtained on Tuesday said Halliburton's dealings with the country cited by state sponsors of terrorism, members of the so-called Axis of Evil, dated back to the 1980s and ran right through 1995-2000.
[01:38:30.296 --> 01:38:40.284]  Says the dealings appear to have continued during the period between 95 and 2000 when Vice President Dick Cheney, head of the company, made apparently ongoing even today, Waxman, a Democrat, and a critic of Bush said.
[01:38:40.704 --> 01:38:41.185]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:38:41.205 --> 01:38:42.906]  The Democrats are all involved in dirt, too.
[01:38:45.068 --> 01:38:57.538]  They're only bringing out enough of this to keep the whole partisan bickering going, and it's two different management teams trying to get control of the CEO job of Slavery Incorporated that, as you know, the big shareholders are the foreign London and New York banks.
[01:38:59.173 --> 01:39:00.654]  Liberation, one month on.
[01:39:00.674 --> 01:39:04.397]  Chaos on the streets, cholera in the city, and killings in broad daylight.
[01:39:04.437 --> 01:39:06.658]  London Independent, every war has its winners.
[01:39:07.399 --> 01:39:16.085]  And the sparkling eyes and Volpin grin of Uday Kwasi Al-Sabib confirmed that he considered himself among them.
[01:39:16.465 --> 01:39:20.128]  Welcome to my new home, he cried, arms outstretched as he stood in his doorway.
[01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:24.211]  Until the American tanks rolled under Saddam Hussein's great hands of victory,
[01:39:25.853 --> 01:39:32.376]  He lived with his mother and 13 others in two rooms in South Baghdad, protected from the elements by the corrugated iron roof.
[01:39:32.396 --> 01:39:41.502]  A personal talent for opportunism and a lawlessness of the capital streets prompted him to try to move up in the world by leaping to the top of a pile in one bound.
[01:39:42.182 --> 01:39:49.286]  Exactly a month has elapsed since the toppling of the Statue of Saddam in the center of Baghdad confirmed the capital and the regime had at last fallen.
[01:39:50.447 --> 01:39:53.389]  As the lawlessness continues, yesterday an American soldier...
[01:39:54.056 --> 01:39:54.936]  We're good to go.
[01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:38.399]  And it goes on to say, under rules agreed by EU ministers yesterday, authorities will be able to collect all fines over 50 pounds for dangerous driving, speeding, and even parking, as well as acts of violence, hooliganism, and sports events, and shoplifting.
[01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:49.946]  You notice they talk about some petty news item instead of the big news item here, and that is that they can arrest you for any other reason now over there under EU rules, including your speech, which can't criticize the EU.
[01:40:51.415 --> 01:40:55.258]  U.S.-Britain acknowledge they are occupying power in Iraq plan.
[01:40:55.278 --> 01:40:58.101]  This out of the Associated Press.
[01:40:58.701 --> 01:41:01.583]  The words are contained in a letter to the President from U.N.
[01:41:01.603 --> 01:41:02.044]  Secretary...
[01:41:02.791 --> 01:41:04.973]  Yeah, like putting all the oil money in a trust fund.
[01:41:23.573 --> 01:41:25.695]  Debate on the idea could flare up fast.
[01:41:25.715 --> 01:41:26.095]  The U.S.
[01:41:26.115 --> 01:41:28.277]  draft resolution is to be introduced Friday.
[01:41:28.617 --> 01:41:31.900]  Russia and France already have proposed different plans for Iraq's future.
[01:41:32.241 --> 01:41:35.263]  So the globalists that control America, don't even call it the U.S.
[01:41:35.283 --> 01:41:35.984]  This isn't the U.S.
[01:41:36.004 --> 01:41:36.404]  doing this.
[01:41:36.865 --> 01:41:42.529]  The parasites that control us, that control the brain case of the country, are now going to the U.N.
[01:41:42.549 --> 01:41:45.372]  saying, yes, we're an occupying force and we now take control.
[01:41:47.117 --> 01:41:47.838]  Unbelievable.
[01:41:48.498 --> 01:41:54.663]  Continuing with the news, despite McCarthy, Red Peril really was.
[01:41:55.004 --> 01:41:57.606]  John Maroney, L.A.
[01:41:57.686 --> 01:42:01.349]  Times, and it goes on.
[01:42:01.369 --> 01:42:07.073]  It says the document shouldn't be allowed to undermine the important historical fact that Soviet communism was a very real threat to U.S.
[01:42:07.153 --> 01:42:11.697]  defense and freedom, and the anti-communist fight waged in the country was a moral one.
[01:42:12.731 --> 01:42:25.660]  Even though the Communist Party succeeded in seducing an estimated 250,000 Americans to its ranks over the course of 40 years, it now says that the documents released show that McCarthy was right.
[01:42:27.101 --> 01:42:29.483]  That McCarthy was right about the Communist takeover.
[01:42:30.924 --> 01:42:33.326]  And it continues...
[01:42:34.585 --> 01:42:35.326]  We're good to go.
[01:42:35.386 --> 01:42:35.666]  I think?
[01:42:56.761 --> 01:43:01.283]  President Bush on Friday will call for a free trade area between the United States and countries of the Middle East in a decade.
[01:43:01.303 --> 01:43:04.845]  So they're going to be fully absorbed, new states of the United States.
[01:43:04.885 --> 01:43:05.586]  That's wonderful.
[01:43:07.587 --> 01:43:11.749]  Continuing, they're going to put in eye scans to leave the U.S., Europe, everywhere.
[01:43:11.789 --> 01:43:14.030]  Total biometric world ID card being set up.
[01:43:14.050 --> 01:43:15.231]  That's from the BBC.
[01:43:16.672 --> 01:43:19.373]  Bush to give a speech today about an Arab democracy.
[01:43:19.413 --> 01:43:20.234]  Give me a break, folks.
[01:43:20.274 --> 01:43:23.375]  Where they appoint people who then vote who the leader will be.
[01:43:23.415 --> 01:43:24.476]  I mean, you talk about a joke.
[01:43:25.539 --> 01:43:29.000]  Halliburton's units bill for Iraq work mounts.
[01:43:29.741 --> 01:43:33.882]  It says Halliburton's going to end up running almost everything in Iraq.
[01:43:33.942 --> 01:43:36.303]  It's going to be over $7 billion.
[01:43:36.483 --> 01:43:46.367]  We've got a lot more that we'll cover, but when we get back, we will go to all the callers that are patiently holding as quickly as possible.
[01:43:46.808 --> 01:43:50.449]  Before I end this segment, I want to remind listeners that I have produced...
[01:43:51.403 --> 01:43:53.765]  Nine documentary films and written a book.
[01:43:54.265 --> 01:43:59.149]  And 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, details who carried out 9-1-1 and how to stop them and expose them.
[01:43:59.489 --> 01:44:00.750]  So does The Masters of Terror.
[01:44:01.090 --> 01:44:02.611]  So does my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:44:02.952 --> 01:44:06.414]  My new film is Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:44:06.714 --> 01:44:08.416]  It's two hours and 37 minutes.
[01:44:08.696 --> 01:44:09.957]  You ought to watch it in three parts.
[01:44:10.017 --> 01:44:11.138]  It's long, but very good.
[01:44:11.718 --> 01:44:16.982]  A real education on the New World Order and their crimes and other examples of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:44:17.322 --> 01:44:19.444]  We don't cover 9-1-1 in detail in this film.
[01:44:20.044 --> 01:44:21.245]  It's an incredible video.
[01:44:22.045 --> 01:44:21.245]  $25.95.
[01:44:22.165 --> 01:44:27.087]  If you order three or more of any of my nine videos, they drop down to $20 apiece.
[01:44:27.107 --> 01:44:27.628]  Call toll-free at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:44:27.648 --> 01:44:28.268]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:44:28.328 --> 01:44:29.128]  Or infowars.com or net.
[01:44:44.035 --> 01:44:45.335]  You don't want to sit idly by.
[01:44:45.355 --> 01:44:54.258]  If you want to take action, get the videos, make hundreds of copies, get them out to opinion makers, educate folks about the true horror of the New World Order.
[01:44:54.718 --> 01:44:59.799]  Force multiply, resist, defend the republic against enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:00.960]  Get the videos.
[01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:01.640]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:03.866 --> 01:45:11.251]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:45:11.531 --> 01:45:16.254]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:45:16.494 --> 01:45:22.138]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:45:22.398 --> 01:45:26.900]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:34.263]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:45:34.303 --> 01:45:38.825]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:45:39.005 --> 01:45:41.506]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:45:41.726 --> 01:45:48.449]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:53.933]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:53.953 --> 01:45:54.374]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:46:02.603 --> 01:46:06.065]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:46:06.345 --> 01:46:09.846]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:46:09.926 --> 01:46:13.868]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:46:14.088 --> 01:46:20.251]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:20.671 --> 01:46:28.575]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:46:28.995 --> 01:46:34.339]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:46:34.499 --> 01:46:38.261]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:46:38.621 --> 01:46:40.483]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:46:40.543 --> 01:46:42.704]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:53.491]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:47:38.996 --> 01:47:39.797]  We're good to go.
[01:48:05.786 --> 01:48:11.810]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:48:12.431 --> 01:48:15.413]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:18.015 --> 01:48:21.357]  It's a tough job, but somebody's got to stand up to this tyranny.
[01:48:21.417 --> 01:48:23.038]  Somebody's got to not be a coward.
[01:48:23.859 --> 01:48:26.440]  Somebody's got to expose the crimes of the New World Order.
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:27.981]  Somebody's got to tell it like it is.
[01:48:28.662 --> 01:48:31.404]  And the more of us that do it, the better off we all are.
[01:48:32.114 --> 01:48:33.354]  Stop cowering in fear.
[01:48:33.374 --> 01:48:35.595]  When you cower in fear to the predator, it wins.
[01:48:36.815 --> 01:48:38.135]  We've got to educate people.
[01:48:38.175 --> 01:48:46.837]  We've got to cut through the confusion of this left-right phony paradigm and the puppets that run this country and the state houses across the land, and they're in D.C.
[01:48:46.857 --> 01:48:47.617]  We've got to do it now.
[01:48:48.238 --> 01:48:51.298]  Jeff, Ron, Rob, Michael, Omar, and others, you're coming up right now.
[01:48:51.318 --> 01:48:53.579]  I've got a bunch of other news the next hour.
[01:48:53.599 --> 01:48:55.419]  I haven't even gotten to some of the most hardcore stuff.
[01:48:56.019 --> 01:48:58.800]  Jeff in Missouri, you're on the air, Jeff.
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:48:59.160]  Go ahead.
[01:48:59.972 --> 01:49:03.695]  Yes, Alex, that book that you said you were reading, was that by any chance Total Resistance?
[01:49:04.936 --> 01:49:05.617]  Well, that's what I said.
[01:49:05.637 --> 01:49:06.838]  Yeah, I was reading Total Resistance.
[01:49:07.118 --> 01:49:09.080]  Yeah, I read that about eight or nine years ago.
[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:11.181]  It's a really fascinating book.
[01:49:11.221 --> 01:49:27.755]  But, you know, the one aspect, Alex, about the dollar dropping in value on the short term is bad, but really in the long run it's good because the process of incrementalism, crisis, problem, reaction, solution, that's incrementally being foisted on us,
[01:49:28.208 --> 01:49:28.808]  We're good to go.
[01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:46.193]  The light being exposed on the wicked deed, but also hitting the American public in their pocketbook where everybody feels it at the same time.
[01:49:46.273 --> 01:49:48.194]  And this is all happening because they're so arrogant.
[01:49:48.214 --> 01:49:53.696]  I mean, do they really think that all the cops and medical workers would take their dangerous vaccine?
[01:49:53.716 --> 01:49:54.177]  They haven't.
[01:49:54.457 --> 01:49:59.619]  So that messes up their program to launch a scare to get a total police state crackdown.
[01:49:59.999 --> 01:50:03.540]  They try to appoint Kissinger to run the 911 whitewash.
[01:50:03.621 --> 01:50:04.581]  No one bought that.
[01:50:05.041 --> 01:50:07.583]  The conservatives are waking up to Bush's gun grabbing.
[01:50:07.943 --> 01:50:09.885]  They're waking up to all of it.
[01:50:10.305 --> 01:50:11.806]  We know the liberals are corrupt.
[01:50:12.227 --> 01:50:14.568]  So, yeah, I do see an awakening taking place.
[01:50:14.608 --> 01:50:16.490]  I don't buy what Peter Jennings says for a second.
[01:50:17.190 --> 01:50:27.658]  Well, I'll tell you, it's going to take, you know, notching it up and cranking it up on their part even worse than 9-11 for most Americans to wake up.
[01:50:27.678 --> 01:50:31.001]  Because Patrick Henry said, you know, it's natural for man to indulge
[01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:32.472]  And the illusions of hope.
[01:50:32.572 --> 01:50:43.542]  We have to shut our eyes against the painful truth and listen to the song of that siren because most people really don't want to hear it until it affects them in one way personally, one way or the other.
[01:50:44.062 --> 01:50:48.746]  And we have to be ready and responsible to tell people, look, this is the truth.
[01:50:49.126 --> 01:50:50.207]  This is where you can find it.
[01:50:50.267 --> 01:50:56.873]  And if they don't want to bother to take 10, 15 minutes online to go look and look up the information themselves, I just don't deal with it.
[01:50:56.913 --> 01:50:58.354]  I talk to somebody else who's open.
[01:50:58.374 --> 01:50:58.975]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:51:00.266 --> 01:51:00.907]  Absolutely.
[01:51:00.967 --> 01:51:04.812]  I hear loud and clear what you're saying, and it makes perfect sense.
[01:51:04.852 --> 01:51:05.674]  I appreciate the call.
[01:51:05.694 --> 01:51:06.194]  All right.
[01:51:06.495 --> 01:51:10.700]  Speaking of the Declaration of Independence, I've reprinted it in dissent and tyranny.
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:12.182]  It's a real thought crime I've committed.
[01:51:12.202 --> 01:51:16.548]  Because remember, the FBI is training police nationwide that anyone that talks about the Constitution is a terrorist.
[01:51:16.568 --> 01:51:17.730]  I have them on tape and wrote tyranny.
[01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:38.793]  It's when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature, that nature is God entitled them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the cause which impelled them to the separation.
[01:51:39.412 --> 01:51:45.100]  We hold these truths self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with their creator with certain unhandable rights.
[01:51:45.821 --> 01:51:49.506]  All of these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:51:49.747 --> 01:51:55.014]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, robbing their just power from the consent of the governed.
[01:51:55.783 --> 01:52:11.162]  Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to reinstitute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such a form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness.
[01:52:12.139 --> 01:52:27.898]  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light or transient causes, and accordingly, all experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
[01:52:28.478 --> 01:52:32.363]  When a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object...
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:42.764]  It is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security.
[01:52:44.465 --> 01:52:47.286]  Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies.
[01:52:48.026 --> 01:52:48.847]  Same thing today.
[01:52:48.867 --> 01:52:51.348]  We'll be right back with your calls and news.
[01:52:51.368 --> 01:52:51.728]  Stay with me.
[01:52:54.793 --> 01:53:00.957]  Mark Tronix is interested in being your radio communications and specialized security and surveillance source.
[01:53:01.277 --> 01:53:11.344]  If you need help in HAM, GMR, FRS, F... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:18.930 --> 01:53:19.571]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.232 --> 01:53:21.273]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.014 --> 01:53:23.115]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:23.776 --> 01:53:24.576]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.337 --> 01:53:26.258]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.899 --> 01:53:30.643]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:35.148]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:53.266]  Welcome back as the Empire slaughters America, destroys our liberties and slaves and dumbs down and forcibly drugs our children, breaks up families everywhere, destroys the border, grabs our guns, liberals, conservatives, all together at the top, destroying America.
[01:53:54.707 --> 01:54:00.269]  We have a CIA government just like they have in Russia, the former KGB minion running things.
[01:54:00.309 --> 01:54:01.269]  We have the same thing here.
[01:54:01.289 --> 01:54:04.891]  We've now gone into hereditary leadership like they have in North Korea.
[01:54:05.849 --> 01:54:07.410]  And it's all public behavior.
[01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:13.075]  The big banks own America and are in the process of destroying our currency, shutting down our economy, enslaving our people.
[01:54:13.375 --> 01:54:14.396]  And I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:54:14.416 --> 01:54:15.716]  Let's go straight back to the calls.
[01:54:16.037 --> 01:54:18.298]  Ron, Rob, Michael, Omar, and others, you're up next.
[01:54:18.759 --> 01:54:20.340]  Ron in New York, you're on the air.
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:20.840]  Go ahead.
[01:54:21.181 --> 01:54:21.581]  Hi, Alex.
[01:54:21.841 --> 01:54:22.381]  How are you doing?
[01:54:22.602 --> 01:54:27.065]  I've reflected on some things over the last 24 hours, and there are several different points.
[01:54:27.665 --> 01:54:29.327]  First off, something dawned upon me.
[01:54:29.907 --> 01:54:31.088]  Why is the administration...
[01:54:31.570 --> 01:54:44.574]  Dealing with the assault weapons ban 15 months before the issue even comes due, in the middle of this climate with so many concerns about the war and so forth, why even deal with that out of the blue so far in advance?
[01:54:44.774 --> 01:54:45.474]  That's strange.
[01:54:45.494 --> 01:54:50.735]  Because they want to act like they're right when they activate some mind-control fruitcake.
[01:54:51.275 --> 01:54:53.956]  You know, the Matrix is coming out, which they say is a big trigger.
[01:54:53.976 --> 01:54:54.736]  Yeah.
[01:54:54.756 --> 01:54:56.237]  I tend to agree.
[01:54:56.677 --> 01:54:59.518]  My feeling is, as that time approaches in September 2004...
[01:55:00.959 --> 01:55:06.923]  You will see, you know, just before that time, strange things happening, Columbine-type things.
[01:55:06.943 --> 01:55:10.105]  You'll see a series of those to try and justify the renewal of a ban.
[01:55:10.525 --> 01:55:12.247]  The coincidences never fail.
[01:55:12.347 --> 01:55:13.808]  Well, even Limbaugh said that.
[01:55:14.308 --> 01:55:17.210]  Every time they introduce a gun bill, there's some mass shooting right on time.
[01:55:18.291 --> 01:55:19.251]  Well, there you go.
[01:55:19.331 --> 01:55:21.613]  Even somebody like him could say that and see that.
[01:55:21.753 --> 01:55:24.335]  Secondly, you'd mentioned the drop in the dollar.
[01:55:24.355 --> 01:55:28.578]  Now, I spoke to you about two or three days ago, and I had told you that there were reports.
[01:55:29.178 --> 01:55:30.579]  I heard this on late-night radio.
[01:55:31.757 --> 01:55:41.502]  That various economists, including the head of the Federal Reserve, was concerned because inflation was dropping and the money would have more value.
[01:55:41.522 --> 01:55:43.963]  And I said that's ridiculous.
[01:55:44.423 --> 01:55:50.106]  The dollar is actually dropping, so they want bad things to happen to the economy.
[01:55:50.526 --> 01:55:58.250]  What I'm saying is, is there a natural process to where it would have been strong, except there's now some monkey wrenching taking place to see to it that it doesn't happen?
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:01.161]  They were worried about the drop in inflation.
[01:56:01.241 --> 01:56:03.261]  Not happy over it, worried over it.
[01:56:03.621 --> 01:56:04.622]  And I found that strange.
[01:56:04.702 --> 01:56:09.403]  It's like somebody's mother telling their son, you look too healthy, son, go out and catch a disease.
[01:56:09.423 --> 01:56:12.164]  It was strange and there was something wrong with that picture.
[01:56:13.144 --> 01:56:18.566]  Secondly, you know, people really have to take stock of themselves.
[01:56:18.846 --> 01:56:26.188]  I don't know if most people or a good portion of our population has sunk so low because they can't take stock of themselves of what's going on.
[01:56:26.898 --> 01:56:37.026]  Like you said, they say they have no time for politics or know what's going on, but they can recite basketball, baseball, football scores, chapter and verse.
[01:56:37.066 --> 01:56:43.430]  They can tell you what happened with some trollop on The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, and Joe the Millionaire.
[01:56:43.451 --> 01:56:44.491]  They're consumed with this, though.
[01:56:44.511 --> 01:56:45.332]  They have time for this.
[01:56:45.868 --> 01:56:47.670]  But they don't have time to know what's going on.
[01:56:47.850 --> 01:56:48.450]  Well, that's it.
[01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:50.932]  I mean, they're not stupid.
[01:56:50.952 --> 01:56:55.576]  They're ignorant, and they've been misdirected into, well, I mean, look, who wants to grow up?
[01:56:55.616 --> 01:56:56.597]  Who wants to be an adult?
[01:56:56.897 --> 01:56:58.659]  Who wants to take on responsibility?
[01:56:59.239 --> 01:57:01.421]  And so the globalists have made it easy to be a slave.
[01:57:01.441 --> 01:57:08.367]  They've made it easy to go to sleep and be stupid and take up habits that are not in our best interest and ignore what is in our best interest.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:09.921]  You know something?
[01:57:09.941 --> 01:57:10.481]  I'll be honest.
[01:57:10.562 --> 01:57:14.525]  I wouldn't be as hardcore in this fight if I didn't know the globalists were so incredibly evil.
[01:57:14.565 --> 01:57:18.108]  It's not just boss hog corruption, you know, little stuff.
[01:57:18.388 --> 01:57:22.592]  This is the most sickening, evil, the things they say they want to do.
[01:57:22.672 --> 01:57:30.319]  Break up all the families, force drug everybody, have no national sovereignty, totally disarm big compact cities, genetic engineering.
[01:57:30.379 --> 01:57:33.121]  I mean, it's a hellish world they want to set up.
[01:57:33.141 --> 01:57:35.283]  The conclusion I've come to with this power elite...
[01:57:36.343 --> 01:57:40.025]  Is that it's not just money alone, or it's not just wealth.
[01:57:40.045 --> 01:57:40.705]  That's a part of it.
[01:57:40.745 --> 01:57:45.647]  But I think they really want to play the part of the living God on this earth.
[01:57:45.767 --> 01:57:46.248]  They do.
[01:57:46.328 --> 01:57:47.328]  They want to destroy us.
[01:57:48.029 --> 01:57:48.949]  They want to enslave us.
[01:57:48.989 --> 01:57:49.829]  They want to control us.
[01:57:50.330 --> 01:57:55.272]  What do delusional leaders, dictators always do?
[01:57:55.472 --> 01:57:57.493]  They always go crazy, don't they?
[01:57:57.533 --> 01:57:58.734]  They marry their horses.
[01:57:58.794 --> 01:58:00.334]  They declare total power.
[01:58:01.575 --> 01:58:02.735]  They run around and act nuts.
[01:58:02.895 --> 01:58:03.956]  Caligulan madness.
[01:58:04.457 --> 01:58:07.304]  And you know, about that left-right argument, I think it was J.P.
[01:58:07.344 --> 01:58:10.131]  Morgan in an interview in the earlier part of the 20th century.
[01:58:10.291 --> 01:58:10.913]  I'm pretty sure it was him.
[01:58:10.933 --> 01:58:11.334]  Stay there.
[01:58:11.354 --> 01:58:12.416]  You've got to finish up everything right.
[01:58:16.451 --> 01:58:24.614]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:58:24.814 --> 01:58:29.275]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[01:58:29.295 --> 01:58:32.436]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[01:58:32.696 --> 01:58:37.258]  It works for just pennies a day with 24 hours, 7 day a week continuous action.
[01:58:37.598 --> 01:58:41.500]  Made of the finest materials, it has a two-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:44.121]  And the Aaronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[01:58:44.421 --> 01:58:48.322]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[01:58:48.542 --> 01:58:53.744]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds, and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[01:58:53.944 --> 01:58:56.885]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[01:58:57.045 --> 01:58:58.946]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[01:58:59.146 --> 01:59:01.787]  For more information about the Aaronizer, call toll-free.
[01:59:02.047 --> 01:59:03.748]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[01:59:03.968 --> 01:59:05.170]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[01:59:05.190 --> 01:59:05.410]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:59:05.470 --> 01:59:07.372]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[01:59:18.226 --> 01:59:19.506]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:59:19.726 --> 01:59:25.468]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:59:25.728 --> 01:59:30.969]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:59:31.289 --> 01:59:35.450]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:59:35.610 --> 01:59:39.391]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:59:39.651 --> 01:59:44.232]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:59:44.372 --> 01:59:50.616]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:59:50.676 --> 01:59:52.537]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:59:52.977 --> 01:59:55.078]  Order 911 The Road to Tarion today.
[01:59:55.158 --> 01:59:57.000]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:59:57.060 --> 02:00:01.562]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:02.303 --> 02:00:06.685]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[02:00:06.805 --> 02:00:08.786]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[02:00:09.027 --> 02:00:10.548]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:00:10.728 --> 02:00:12.789]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:00:13.553 --> 02:00:22.681]  Enzyme Phytonutrient or EPN is a new all-in-one combination of enzymes and saccharides necessary for optimal cellular communication.
[02:00:23.342 --> 02:00:33.411]  EPN is created using a unique 14-day process resembling human digestion in which soy seeds are completely assimilated into basic nutrients and natural sweeteners.
[02:00:34.012 --> 02:00:39.717]  Enzymes are complex proteins found in digestive juices causing food to break down at an accelerated rate.
[02:00:40.257 --> 02:00:45.562]  Phytonutrients come from plants, which provide important protective substances called phytochemicals.
[02:00:46.062 --> 02:00:49.085]  Saccharides are known to be important in cellular communication.
[02:00:49.625 --> 02:00:52.388]  One tablespoon before each meal is all that is needed.
[02:00:52.808 --> 02:01:05.699]  The diseases EPN may be helpful in relieving are too numerous to mention here, so call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for more information about this exciting new dietary supplement.
[02:01:06.221 --> 02:01:12.547]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[02:01:14.569 --> 02:01:16.851]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:01:17.431 --> 02:01:20.274]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:26.339 --> 02:01:30.323]  I was watching Escape from New York with Kirk Russell this weekend.
[02:01:30.343 --> 02:01:32.104]  Made in the early 80s.
[02:01:33.726 --> 02:01:42.293]  The government flies black helicopters, they wear black ski masks, black armored outfits, and now our police are dressed like that.
[02:01:42.333 --> 02:01:44.495]  You watch the movie 1984 from the book.
[02:01:45.115 --> 02:01:47.517]  Black ski masks, black helmets, black uniforms.
[02:01:47.557 --> 02:01:48.578]  They do that now here.
[02:01:50.059 --> 02:02:02.849]  In every book or film made of a police state future, the running man, the billboards flash messages about terrorists they're going to get you, and you later find out it's the government carrying out terror attacks and blaming it on their enemies.
[02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:05.601]  Why do they throw all this in our face?
[02:02:06.021 --> 02:02:12.465]  It's part of conditioning, acclimating, making us comfortable with this.
[02:02:13.566 --> 02:02:26.254]  And when the government says they're going to have the Total Information Awareness Network written and run by a convicted felon, Admiral Poindexter, Total Information Awareness.
[02:02:26.374 --> 02:02:30.156]  In Boston Logan Airport and four other airports, they put NASA brain scanners in to, quote,
[02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:31.941]  Hell, if you're agitated.
[02:02:32.441 --> 02:02:34.683]  In 1984, they didn't scan your brain.
[02:02:35.283 --> 02:02:37.044]  This is total information awareness.
[02:02:37.564 --> 02:02:38.285]  Worse than 1984.
[02:02:38.785 --> 02:02:41.827]  Then they say, oh, but it's to keep you safe.
[02:02:42.928 --> 02:02:44.989]  It's to keep you safe, America.
[02:02:45.009 --> 02:02:47.831]  We just want to keep you safe.
[02:02:49.612 --> 02:02:56.916]  But the borders stay wide open, and they're putting the Ba'athists back in power in Iraq because they're good thugs trained by the CIA in the 70s and 80s.
[02:02:57.216 --> 02:02:57.917]  It's the same thing.
[02:02:58.639 --> 02:03:07.723]  And Ron in New York was telling us that, yeah, people can figure out the sports scores and all this inane stuff, but they can't figure out their first ten amendments of the Bill of Rights.
[02:03:08.603 --> 02:03:14.625]  People, you better get your head screwed on, because they're doing a lot of horrible things, and we're losing our freedom in this country.
[02:03:15.286 --> 02:03:17.827]  Go ahead with your final comment about J.P.
[02:03:17.867 --> 02:03:18.847]  Morgan, the big banker.
[02:03:19.747 --> 02:03:25.610]  Turn of the century, his comment about he doesn't care who controls the left or right, and we'll go to Rob and Michael and Omar and others.
[02:03:25.650 --> 02:03:26.731]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:03:26.831 --> 02:03:36.175]  I'm paraphrasing, but I believe in an interview with a journalist at that time, he said he found the left-right debate entertaining because he controlled both sides of the debate.
[02:03:37.096 --> 02:03:39.157]  And, you know, I always remembered that.
[02:03:39.237 --> 02:03:44.720]  I had heard about that comment he had made so many years back, and I had heard that comment several years ago.
[02:03:46.195 --> 02:03:52.160]  That he found the debate between left and right entertaining because it says especially when you control both sides of the debate.
[02:03:52.361 --> 02:03:53.922]  Puppet on the left, puppet on the right.
[02:03:54.002 --> 02:03:55.043]  Gee, I like this puppet.
[02:03:55.083 --> 02:03:55.784]  Thanks for the call.
[02:03:56.024 --> 02:03:56.544]  You're welcome.
[02:03:56.925 --> 02:03:57.425]  Exactly.
[02:03:57.465 --> 02:04:00.308]  Some people go, oh, Bush is going to reinstate the assault weapons ban.
[02:04:00.868 --> 02:04:03.251]  That's a smokescreen for the other gun mills.
[02:04:04.592 --> 02:04:05.052]  S-22 and others.
[02:04:06.423 --> 02:04:07.864]  Total gun registration.
[02:04:08.324 --> 02:04:09.705]  Shutdown of the gun shows.
[02:04:10.245 --> 02:04:11.966]  National ballistics databases.
[02:04:12.447 --> 02:04:14.508]  The NRA won't tell their members.
[02:04:15.048 --> 02:04:18.250]  Republicans already passed it last session out of the House.
[02:04:19.611 --> 02:04:20.992]  Session ended when it was in the Senate.
[02:04:21.852 --> 02:04:23.753]  I mean, come on, people.
[02:04:24.934 --> 02:04:26.175]  Bush isn't running anything.
[02:04:26.475 --> 02:04:27.475]  He's following orders.
[02:04:27.536 --> 02:04:28.336]  It's an agenda.
[02:04:29.016 --> 02:04:29.937]  The same agenda.
[02:04:30.791 --> 02:04:34.494]  So I'm not going to get caught up bashing Bush or bashing Clinton or bashing Daschle.
[02:04:34.974 --> 02:04:38.077]  They're errand boys for the New World Order.
[02:04:38.097 --> 02:04:43.261]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Wyoming, from New York to Wyoming.
[02:04:43.601 --> 02:04:44.162]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:04:44.382 --> 02:04:44.782]  Hey, Alex.
[02:04:44.802 --> 02:04:46.063]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:04:46.243 --> 02:04:46.624]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:46.844 --> 02:04:57.212]  Hey, I wanted to really quickly talk about the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, Article 6, Section 2, where supposedly treaties supersede our sovereignty and that kind of stuff, right?
[02:04:58.612 --> 02:05:03.295]  First of all, NAFTA and GATT and the World Trade Organization agreements are agreements.
[02:05:03.315 --> 02:05:05.916]  They're commercial agreements, not treaties.
[02:05:06.156 --> 02:05:11.759]  Between the commercial District of Columbia, District of Criminal, and the private sector.
[02:05:12.646 --> 02:05:13.586]  It's 68 miles square.
[02:05:13.626 --> 02:05:15.127]  There's a parallel jurisdiction there.
[02:05:15.587 --> 02:05:26.231]  And according to Clearfield Trust Company versus the United States, Clearfield Trust doctrine, when government lowers itself into commerce, it has no more power than any other corporation.
[02:05:26.411 --> 02:05:29.812]  There's still the general sovereign government that it owes its existence to.
[02:05:29.852 --> 02:05:32.793]  And the second is the one that's making the agreement.
[02:05:32.813 --> 02:05:33.593]  There's no treaty there.
[02:05:34.233 --> 02:05:48.559]  But when you read the Supremacy Clause, this Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, the sovereign has to do it, shall be the supreme law of the land.
[02:05:49.259 --> 02:05:53.140]  Anything in the laws or constitutions of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.
[02:05:53.681 --> 02:05:54.521]  For those who don't know...
[02:05:55.616 --> 02:05:58.098]  Uniform commercial code is just admiralty law.
[02:05:58.678 --> 02:06:20.691]  And a private group hijacked Washington, set up the United States of America, not the United States, it's public fact, admitted in court cases, and they have the guns, they have the funds, they get states to sign contracts to, quote, get money, but they extracted off their illegal income tax to begin with, and so this is how they run things in Iraq.
[02:06:20.731 --> 02:06:23.193]  They pay off leaders with gold bars to follow their orders.
[02:06:23.795 --> 02:06:25.076]  This is how they set it up.
[02:06:25.136 --> 02:06:27.339]  The problem is they don't follow any law now.
[02:06:28.139 --> 02:06:38.229]  Well, I agree with you, except from my understanding, the Uniform Commercial Code is actually from the law merchant in which the truth is sovereign, all men are equal before the law.
[02:06:38.269 --> 02:06:43.054]  It's kind of a codification of that, and it does always provide an escape route to the common law.
[02:06:43.234 --> 02:06:47.298]  Yeah, but the average person doesn't even know what the Bill of Rights is or the Ninth Amendment.
[02:06:47.788 --> 02:06:49.009]  Well, listen, one quick thing here.
[02:06:49.389 --> 02:06:56.114]  When it says, here's the actual quote, anything in the Constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.
[02:06:56.534 --> 02:07:04.160]  Now, that's not talking about the Constitution that's being, the United States Federal Constitution, because whenever it refers to that, it says this Constitution.
[02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:09.703]  If it meant the Federal Constitution, then there would be no mention of each state constitution.
[02:07:09.763 --> 02:07:11.024]  See, it's kind of a tricky word.
[02:07:11.064 --> 02:07:13.486]  But you're not... It's talking about the Constitution of the state.
[02:07:13.526 --> 02:07:14.387]  Hold on, you're saying... Okay, okay.
[02:07:15.007 --> 02:07:15.867]  I understand all this.
[02:07:16.368 --> 02:07:21.089]  So how do you stop the SWAT teams from arresting you for potting soil?
[02:07:21.409 --> 02:07:30.312]  Well, I keep hearing about civil actions against these guys instead of criminal prosecutions to put them in prison.
[02:07:30.453 --> 02:07:30.813]  I agree.
[02:07:31.113 --> 02:07:33.254]  And there's always immunity against any person.
[02:07:33.274 --> 02:07:33.734]  Hold on.
[02:07:33.794 --> 02:07:34.154]  Hold on.
[02:07:34.594 --> 02:07:37.115]  We need real grand juries.
[02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:40.271]  To indict these people, you're absolutely right.
[02:07:40.391 --> 02:07:44.973]  Well, you've got Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 54A and B, two different types of juries.
[02:07:45.653 --> 02:07:51.316]  One is selected, 54A type juries are selected from the district, but not from the state.
[02:07:51.836 --> 02:07:58.399]  The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution has a trial by jury, not a jury trial, selected from the state and district.
[02:07:59.139 --> 02:08:01.580]  So that's where you get your foreign sovereign immunity.
[02:08:02.256 --> 02:08:07.118]  For those who don't understand this, how does the U.N.
[02:08:07.198 --> 02:08:09.178]  come here, a U.N.
[02:08:09.218 --> 02:08:16.260]  official run over somebody in a street drunk driving, they get caught, nothing happens to them because they declare that sovereignty.
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:19.201]  Well, but see, they'll try to claim that's what's meant by foreign sovereign.
[02:08:19.622 --> 02:08:21.582]  Immunity is some guy from another country.
[02:08:21.602 --> 02:08:24.243]  Well, my point is, how does a foreigner have it, but we don't?
[02:08:25.024 --> 02:08:26.505]  Well, we do have it under the law.
[02:08:26.525 --> 02:08:33.829]  Yeah, we do have it, but sir, but sir, if people believe the world is flat, to them it is flat.
[02:08:33.869 --> 02:08:37.250]  The globalists say it best, perception is reality.
[02:08:37.871 --> 02:08:38.031]  True.
[02:08:38.611 --> 02:08:42.113]  So they've got a mass that doesn't even know what you're talking about.
[02:08:42.473 --> 02:08:45.575]  It's total Greek to them, and you're right.
[02:08:45.615 --> 02:08:47.035]  We have to set about educating them.
[02:08:47.055 --> 02:08:48.076]  Look at the Ninth Amendment.
[02:08:49.056 --> 02:08:49.957]  Look at the Ninth Amendment.
[02:08:50.805 --> 02:08:57.831]  The enumeration of the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
[02:08:58.792 --> 02:09:05.177]  The enumeration of the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
[02:09:05.237 --> 02:09:06.618]  That's stronger than the 10th?
[02:09:07.459 --> 02:09:07.939]  Any of them.
[02:09:07.979 --> 02:09:11.603]  It's saying, folks, this just points your God-given rights out.
[02:09:11.623 --> 02:09:12.764]  And somebody can say, well, what do you mean?
[02:09:12.824 --> 02:09:16.947]  Well, if you've got a law that you can kill black slaves in 1830s Georgia,
[02:09:20.737 --> 02:09:22.418]  That they're your property.
[02:09:22.879 --> 02:09:32.346]  God's law says that that black man is still a human being and has a right to physically fight back against the man that goes, oh, I got a law that you're not a human being.
[02:09:32.626 --> 02:09:33.147]  Absolutely.
[02:09:33.187 --> 02:09:36.369]  So they can say all their laws, all their garbage all day.
[02:09:36.749 --> 02:09:47.718]  We got to educate people that it's a criminal, run amok, out of control, enemy combatant, foreign jurisdiction, occupation army, owned by the old bankers we got away from in 1776.
[02:09:49.279 --> 02:09:50.660]  Well, we're doing it.
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:51.500]  I'm really hopeful.
[02:09:52.141 --> 02:09:55.262]  I mean, there's just about everybody I talk to, strangers.
[02:09:55.382 --> 02:10:02.767]  One guy from New York over a year ago, he understood immediately about 9-11 and all that stuff.
[02:10:04.107 --> 02:10:12.052]  Well, I just want the government to know that I've done 800-plus interviews around the country on big stations, little stations, liberal shows, conservative shows.
[02:10:12.552 --> 02:10:14.433]  We've had about 100 calls that disagreed.
[02:10:15.197 --> 02:10:18.400]  And about, I don't know, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people that agreed.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:23.403]  I mean, we'll take 30 calls on a show, and I'll get one call that disagrees, and it's some incoherent idiot.
[02:10:23.784 --> 02:10:25.605]  So that's who you've got on your side.
[02:10:26.366 --> 02:10:28.547]  And I want this illegitimate government to know that.
[02:10:28.567 --> 02:10:29.548]  And I'm not mad at you.
[02:10:29.688 --> 02:10:30.929]  I understand your points, Rob.
[02:10:33.618 --> 02:10:36.560]  Well, the Olympians overstepped their bounds with this.
[02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:41.102]  They got overconfident with their godlike self-image.
[02:10:41.382 --> 02:10:42.503]  Well, that's it.
[02:10:42.583 --> 02:10:44.103]  Leaders always get delusional.
[02:10:44.484 --> 02:10:45.604]  They always flip out.
[02:10:46.265 --> 02:10:51.087]  And that's why the bankers have gotten smart and try to have regional boards and different management teams.
[02:10:51.187 --> 02:10:53.068]  And that's the Republicans, Democrats.
[02:10:53.128 --> 02:10:55.970]  But now even their minions are getting delusional.
[02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:57.110]  You can see it in their actions.
[02:10:57.190 --> 02:10:59.331]  And it's not going to work the way they think it is.
[02:10:59.571 --> 02:11:00.112]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:00.132 --> 02:11:00.372]  Thank you.
[02:11:00.931 --> 02:11:03.893]  Yeah, they're not going to destroy America, these enemy combatants.
[02:11:03.933 --> 02:11:05.274]  We're going to stop the enemy combatants.
[02:11:06.014 --> 02:11:09.716]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Colorado.
[02:11:09.736 --> 02:11:10.457]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:11:13.779 --> 02:11:15.000]  Maybe Michael's gone then.
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:15.740]  Okay.
[02:11:16.961 --> 02:11:17.641]  Michael, you gone?
[02:11:17.961 --> 02:11:18.262]  Hello?
[02:11:18.522 --> 02:11:19.182]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:11:19.842 --> 02:11:20.263]  Oh, hello, Alex.
[02:11:20.323 --> 02:11:20.943]  How are you doing?
[02:11:21.183 --> 02:11:21.403]  Good.
[02:11:22.484 --> 02:11:28.748]  I just wanted to tell you that I'm really encouraged by the information that you put out, and it has totally changed my life.
[02:11:29.782 --> 02:11:34.144]  And I have a new mission, which is to fight this new world order to the bitter end.
[02:11:35.264 --> 02:11:45.188]  Another thing, too, is that I'm a University of Colorado Denver student, and just yesterday they had a bunch of Black Hawk helicopters land in the soccer field.
[02:11:45.989 --> 02:11:51.651]  And I guess it was just one of their usual publicity stunts because everybody was running over there, Yay, Black Hawk helicopters!
[02:11:51.671 --> 02:11:53.152]  Yeah, they don't exist.
[02:11:53.452 --> 02:11:56.413]  Let me tell you, and I'll hold you over when we need to because you've held a while, but let me just say this.
[02:11:57.145 --> 02:12:01.249]  I watched a documentary about the takeover of Panama.
[02:12:01.950 --> 02:12:05.714]  And for six months before the invasion, they would just have them do touch and go.
[02:12:05.894 --> 02:12:11.159]  And the government admits this is all part of our acclamation for total military open dictatorship.
[02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:12.681]  But it'll be after the next attack.
[02:12:13.414 --> 02:12:15.595]  They're just acclimating us, getting us ready.
[02:12:16.175 --> 02:12:19.795]  This is the preparation for total control because they've got some really bad stuff planned.
[02:12:20.095 --> 02:12:23.176]  In the new depression, they're going to engineer the sharing of the sheep.
[02:12:23.776 --> 02:12:30.198]  And they're also going to have top-off, too, another FEMA drill to practice taking over, shutting down highways, force inoculations.
[02:12:30.238 --> 02:12:30.618]  Go ahead.
[02:12:31.538 --> 02:12:32.978]  Oh, I totally see it.
[02:12:33.118 --> 02:12:38.619]  And I wouldn't have seen it not even five months ago had I not seen your 9-11 road to tyranny.
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:41.080]  What were people saying when the black helicopters were landing?
[02:12:42.478 --> 02:12:44.179]  I actually didn't go over to the crowd.
[02:12:45.019 --> 02:12:50.762]  I just watched from afar, but it was just like they opened up their engines and their nose plates and stuff like that.
[02:12:51.422 --> 02:12:54.284]  And they've been doing that for, what, six years here in Austin?
[02:12:55.164 --> 02:13:01.167]  And they hand out recruiting cards so your kid can go get injected with some deadly vaccine and come back and die of cancer.
[02:13:01.447 --> 02:13:01.807]  Stay there.
[02:13:01.827 --> 02:13:04.708]  I want to hear more about it, Michael, jumping all over you.
[02:13:04.728 --> 02:13:08.170]  I just want to get all the information in, and then we'll go to Omar and others, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:13:14.306 --> 02:13:14.726]  Gold.
[02:13:15.087 --> 02:13:16.368]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:13:16.628 --> 02:13:22.732]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:13:22.912 --> 02:13:26.735]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:13:27.075 --> 02:13:28.976]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:13:29.016 --> 02:13:31.318]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:13:31.458 --> 02:13:38.563]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:13:38.643 --> 02:13:39.483]  We're good to go.
[02:13:53.948 --> 02:13:58.133]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.

[02:14:51.053 --> 02:14:52.154]  Don't use much long distance?
[02:14:52.554 --> 02:14:53.654]  Ask about the select plan.

[02:14:59.796 --> 02:15:00.976]  The switch is seamless.

[02:15:15.789 --> 02:15:16.309]  It's here.
[02:15:16.589 --> 02:15:17.310]  It's powerful.
[02:15:17.610 --> 02:15:26.194]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[02:15:26.474 --> 02:15:28.335]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[02:15:28.595 --> 02:15:30.656]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[02:15:30.916 --> 02:15:35.157]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[02:15:35.457 --> 02:15:41.159]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[02:15:41.359 --> 02:15:43.119]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[02:15:43.279 --> 02:15:46.500]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:48.280]  Get the powerful Berkey now.

[02:15:55.442 --> 02:15:55.823]  Normally $279.

[02:16:00.088 --> 02:16:01.009]  Call toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:16:01.029 --> 02:16:01.470]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:16:01.490 --> 02:16:03.612]  Not yet available in California and Iowa.
[02:16:12.589 --> 02:16:13.590]  Jim, I'm worried.
[02:16:14.090 --> 02:16:15.571]  You don't have enough life insurance.
[02:16:15.811 --> 02:16:17.592]  How would the kids and I get by without you?
[02:16:17.612 --> 02:16:20.314]  I know, but it's such a hassle finding the best rates.
[02:16:20.554 --> 02:16:23.636]  You know, I talked to Sue Carter, and she told me about BestQuote.
[02:16:24.016 --> 02:16:28.419]  Bob actually doubled his coverage with a leading insurance company without paying a penny more.
[02:16:28.439 --> 02:16:28.899]  Really?
[02:16:29.119 --> 02:16:29.940]  But what's the catch?
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:30.480]  No catch.
[02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:32.522]  You just call them for free quotes in the mail.
[02:16:32.722 --> 02:16:34.523]  No salesman ever contacts you.
[02:16:34.563 --> 02:16:35.824]  I've heard rates are coming down.
[02:16:35.904 --> 02:16:36.264]  You know what?
[02:16:36.325 --> 02:16:37.185]  I'll call Best Quote.
[02:16:37.505 --> 02:16:37.946]  That's right.
[02:16:38.026 --> 02:16:40.227]  You can save up to 70% on your premiums.
[02:16:40.408 --> 02:16:47.853]  For instance, a 35-year-old non-smoking male can get a quarter million dollars of coverage for less than $12 a month, guaranteed for 10 years.
[02:16:48.234 --> 02:16:48.854]  Honey, you were right.
[02:16:49.014 --> 02:16:51.996]  Best Quote got us a lot more insurance, and we're paying less per month.
[02:16:52.136 --> 02:16:53.578]  Thanks for taking care of us, Jim.
[02:16:53.758 --> 02:16:55.439]  I can't believe I put it off for so long.
[02:16:55.619 --> 02:16:56.800]  Best Quote made it so easy.
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:16:57.200]  Easy.
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:16:58.561]  You know, I've really got to apologize to the listeners.
[02:17:26.155 --> 02:17:29.999]  By the third hour, as you listen to the first, second hour, I'm not too wound up.
[02:17:30.599 --> 02:17:32.261]  By the third hour, I'm cutting people off.
[02:17:32.321 --> 02:17:33.142]  I'm ranting and raving.
[02:17:33.522 --> 02:17:35.084]  Guy makes a point about helicopters landing.
[02:17:35.104 --> 02:17:35.904]  I get so mad.
[02:17:35.924 --> 02:17:39.207]  I want to tell people what they're doing there, what's happening.
[02:17:39.748 --> 02:17:44.592]  I just start blurting stuff out, and I get out of control because I'm angry about what's happening.
[02:17:44.672 --> 02:17:45.774]  I love this country.
[02:17:45.834 --> 02:17:46.875]  It's tearing me apart.
[02:17:47.095 --> 02:17:50.378]  They're turning America into a dirty military dictatorship.
[02:17:51.977 --> 02:17:53.717]  Well, you better support the troops!
[02:17:53.897 --> 02:17:57.058]  Our troops don't fight and die to live in a place like Saddam Hussein's kingdom.
[02:17:57.278 --> 02:17:59.098]  You know, Saddam Hussein had troops on the streets.
[02:17:59.359 --> 02:18:00.679]  Now look at what's happening to America.
[02:18:01.339 --> 02:18:05.040]  Go ahead, Michael in Colorado, then Omar, Kevin, Curtis.
[02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:08.760]  Oh, yeah, well, I just wanted to say that they weren't camouflaged or anything.
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:14.502]  It was one Huey and then one slightly bigger chopper, and it was straight-up black.
[02:18:14.622 --> 02:18:15.922]  Both of the choppers were black.
[02:18:16.222 --> 02:18:19.182]  And it is an acclimation, just like you say.
[02:18:19.202 --> 02:18:21.603]  Yeah, those are domestic helicopters, the black ones are.
[02:18:22.259 --> 02:18:30.707]  Yeah, and then my other third thing that I wanted to bring up is that I wanted to ask you if you had any information on underground prison camps that they're developing.
[02:18:31.087 --> 02:18:32.829]  Yes, I have mainstream news articles.
[02:18:33.069 --> 02:18:35.872]  INS Kentucky poured concrete for two years under a giant...
[02:18:36.585 --> 02:18:40.987]  Underground old coal mine and built a supermax on top of it with airfields and everything.
[02:18:41.267 --> 02:18:43.007]  They're building giant prisons everywhere.
[02:18:43.047 --> 02:18:44.048]  It's the new economy.
[02:18:44.388 --> 02:18:47.049]  A giant prison economy where they literally own us.
[02:18:47.289 --> 02:18:50.050]  Where torture is the order of the day and is a virtue.
[02:18:50.410 --> 02:19:03.395]  That's very interesting because down here in Trinidad we're having seismographic readings and in Trinidad was the site of an old Japanese internment camp and it has old mines but they're getting seismographic readings but there's no faults there.
[02:19:04.033 --> 02:19:07.334]  And so I'm going to collect as much hard evidence as I can.
[02:19:07.534 --> 02:19:17.078]  Sir, your Denver International Airport has pictures of Nazis machine-gunning piles of dead bodies, satanic art everywhere, a giant FEMA camp on it publicly.
[02:19:17.678 --> 02:19:17.958]  Really?
[02:19:18.939 --> 02:19:20.839]  Yeah, you ever seen the artwork on the Denver Airport?
[02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:22.100]  No, I have not.
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:26.562]  If I've been Denver International Airport artwork, you'll get to see it online.
[02:19:27.242 --> 02:19:27.422]  Okay.
[02:19:28.542 --> 02:19:28.822]  Okay.
[02:19:29.102 --> 02:19:30.143]  These people are nuts.
[02:19:30.243 --> 02:19:34.785]  So you didn't talk to any of the students afterwards of what they thought about the visitation?
[02:19:36.206 --> 02:19:43.669]  I didn't want to go over to the crowd because I'm not into that, but I asked other people who had seen it and they weren't very interested.
[02:19:44.229 --> 02:19:46.410]  I had a city councilwoman on last year from Denver.
[02:19:46.430 --> 02:19:49.432]  She admits they're trying to, quote, put you all on the sports stadium.
[02:19:49.452 --> 02:19:52.933]  Did you see the Rocky Mountain News article about the mass graves and incinerators?
[02:19:53.914 --> 02:19:54.094]  No.
[02:19:55.265 --> 02:19:59.708]  Yo, it's on InfoWars.com, and it's in the new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:20:01.289 --> 02:20:07.833]  I'm buying that, and then as soon as I get the chance, I've made it my goal to hand out 1,000 copies before 2004 hits.
[02:20:08.134 --> 02:20:09.755]  Yes, do it, do it, do it.
[02:20:10.135 --> 02:20:11.636]  Total resistance to this tyranny.
[02:20:11.996 --> 02:20:15.899]  We must fight the enemy combatants, the foreign government that's taken over.
[02:20:15.919 --> 02:20:20.602]  Okay, well, I'd like to thank you for your inspiration, and I'll go so you can get to the other callers.
[02:20:20.782 --> 02:20:22.123]  Thank you, I appreciate the call.
[02:20:22.992 --> 02:20:26.215]  And explain to people on campus it's not a Republican or a Democrat thing.
[02:20:26.255 --> 02:20:27.896]  This is an agenda of the New World Order.
[02:20:29.558 --> 02:20:32.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Omar in Michigan.
[02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:33.000]  Omar, welcome, sir.
[02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:34.642]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:20:34.882 --> 02:20:35.643]  Pretty good, my friend.
[02:20:35.963 --> 02:20:37.104]  Been doing good work.
[02:20:37.584 --> 02:20:42.949]  And I think you could take a two-week vacation because you got so many people passing the tape out.
[02:20:43.629 --> 02:20:48.013]  And so once people see it, it's like, hey, they want to know more.
[02:20:48.794 --> 02:20:49.854]  You know, and it's like...
[02:20:50.962 --> 02:20:52.263]  It's up to the people now.
[02:20:52.443 --> 02:20:56.347]  You know, if they don't do nothing for their freedom, they don't deserve it.
[02:20:56.647 --> 02:20:59.069]  I mean, you can't get no better than this.
[02:20:59.109 --> 02:21:06.495]  They just said Condoleezza Rice and Bush had note memos on their desk in August.
[02:21:07.676 --> 02:21:08.957]  Did you hear anything about that?
[02:21:09.658 --> 02:21:16.344]  Well, I know that Bush had the launch battle plan to invade Afghanistan two days before.
[02:21:17.285 --> 02:21:19.886]  I know that they had already advised there was going to be an attack.
[02:21:20.027 --> 02:21:21.467]  I know they had total prior knowledge.
[02:21:21.487 --> 02:21:22.888]  That's public all over the news.
[02:21:23.788 --> 02:21:25.029]  And that came out.
[02:21:25.229 --> 02:21:28.751]  But what particular thing are you talking about, Connalisa Rice?
[02:21:28.791 --> 02:21:29.611]  What particular memo?
[02:21:30.332 --> 02:21:34.414]  About the attack on the World Trade Center.
[02:21:35.293 --> 02:21:39.716]  Well, yeah, I mean, look, the three of the supposed hijackers were trained at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[02:21:40.036 --> 02:21:44.119]  The rest of them, all of them, had their homes and cars paid for by the FBI.
[02:21:44.159 --> 02:21:45.180]  That's mainstream news.
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:48.222]  They just calmly report this, and we're supposed to forget about it.
[02:21:48.862 --> 02:21:49.923]  Now, that's what I'm saying.
[02:21:49.943 --> 02:22:00.230]  We need to increase, you know, demanding that they bring these people to justice, the whole Bush administration and all these surf minions and bootlickers.
[02:22:01.383 --> 02:22:02.564]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[02:22:02.584 --> 02:22:04.665]  You certainly know that Bush is just a puppet, though, right?
[02:22:04.765 --> 02:22:05.065]  Right.
[02:22:05.125 --> 02:22:06.606]  We need to get his puppet mask.
[02:22:08.327 --> 02:22:11.609]  Well, I would agree that the Rothschilds and others need to be exposed.
[02:22:11.629 --> 02:22:15.191]  They need to be exterminated like they had a plan for everybody else.
[02:22:15.611 --> 02:22:18.493]  If it's good enough for everybody else, it's probably good enough for them.
[02:22:18.693 --> 02:22:19.374]  Well, I'm not sure.
[02:22:19.694 --> 02:22:24.797]  My audio is cutting out, but I appreciate your call, Omar.
[02:22:26.138 --> 02:22:27.599]  I'm trying to follow what you were saying.
[02:22:28.479 --> 02:22:29.900]  Maybe we boost the audio a little bit.
[02:22:31.764 --> 02:22:58.453]  We're going to win this thing peaceably, non-violently, with what you first said, Omar, that we need to make copies of the films, we need to expose, we need to promote the talk show hosts in your area that are telling the truth, we need to get past Republican-Democrat, and we need to expose the fact that the people in the White House aren't running anything, Daschle isn't running anything, and we need to expose that fact.
[02:22:58.973 --> 02:23:00.034]  It's very, very important.
[02:23:00.054 --> 02:23:00.614]  We'll be right back.
[02:23:03.766 --> 02:23:04.686]  We're on the march.
[02:23:05.147 --> 02:23:06.787]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:07.688 --> 02:23:10.469]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:14.530 --> 02:23:18.432]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:23:18.652 --> 02:23:24.094]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:23:24.374 --> 02:23:25.234]  Ideal for travel.
[02:23:25.254 --> 02:23:25.614]  That's 877-605-9200.
[02:23:25.674 --> 02:23:26.074]  Call today.
[02:23:44.020 --> 02:24:01.183]  All right, going out on the AM and FM dial across the land, simulcasting on the Internet at infowars.com, infowars.net, and prisonplanet.com.
[02:24:02.751 --> 02:24:12.759]  And on Global Shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 Central on 12.172 and 93.20 and back from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[02:24:13.380 --> 02:24:16.322]  And I talked to the folks running the show.
[02:24:16.382 --> 02:24:19.505]  I wanted to, because I wasn't sure I heard what I heard from Curtis.
[02:24:21.046 --> 02:24:22.007]  Or no, it wasn't Curtis.
[02:24:22.067 --> 02:24:23.188]  Curtis is coming up.
[02:24:23.308 --> 02:24:26.991]  I was talking to Omar last segment from Michigan.
[02:24:28.432 --> 02:24:29.954]  And so I did hear what I thought I heard.
[02:24:29.974 --> 02:24:30.654]  My audio was low.
[02:24:32.541 --> 02:24:34.243]  Omar, let me explain something to you.
[02:24:34.823 --> 02:24:39.888]  I'm sure you're a nice person and mean well, and I appreciate your hard work, and you say you're waking folks up.
[02:24:39.968 --> 02:24:46.794]  But look, I've tried to make this clear, and this is what I truly believe and know, and I know what I'm talking about.
[02:24:47.395 --> 02:24:49.557]  I work on this probably harder than anybody else.
[02:24:51.118 --> 02:24:56.063]  Fighting the New World Order, defending my family, standing against crime, standing against evil.
[02:24:56.934 --> 02:24:59.636]  Have you not learned what I've said here, what history shows?
[02:24:59.736 --> 02:25:12.663]  The globalists carry out violent acts against their own institutions as a way to legitimize power and control and domination and the destruction of liberty.
[02:25:13.403 --> 02:25:16.405]  Violence is not the way to go.
[02:25:16.425 --> 02:25:19.727]  I will say it over and over and over again.
[02:25:20.227 --> 02:25:21.108]  Look at Waco.
[02:25:22.628 --> 02:25:23.289]  They came in.
[02:25:24.136 --> 02:25:25.677]  They opened fire on the Davidians.
[02:25:25.717 --> 02:25:27.917]  That's now admitted in congressional reports.
[02:25:29.518 --> 02:25:38.200]  Imagine if the Davidians just would have walked out, and I know that's a totally unnatural thing to do, and wouldn't have fired back, what that would have made the BATF look like.
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:41.642]  Well, they probably would have framed them and said, oh, they fired, but a lot of them in prison.
[02:25:42.122 --> 02:25:48.484]  But those children wouldn't have died inside when the Delta Force set the place on fire and shot people trying to flee.
[02:25:51.485 --> 02:25:52.425]  Now, understand...
[02:25:53.248 --> 02:25:57.492]  They pull a couple more Waco's like that and barbecue people, it's over for the globalists.
[02:25:58.032 --> 02:25:59.354]  They have to worry about that.
[02:25:59.394 --> 02:26:01.175]  They have to demonize people first.
[02:26:01.876 --> 02:26:06.220]  It's hard for them to go out and just carry violence out against somebody who's done nothing to them.
[02:26:06.740 --> 02:26:07.641]  They've got to demonize you.
[02:26:07.661 --> 02:26:08.362]  They've got to frame you.
[02:26:08.662 --> 02:26:09.683]  That's hard to do in mass.
[02:26:10.948 --> 02:26:23.615]  The globalists have had to carry out terror attacks on their own or allow enemies to attack and not defend against it like Pearl Harbor, now admitted fact, so they can play the part of the good guy who's just fighting back.
[02:26:25.075 --> 02:26:27.016]  We're winning the fight in the Infowar.
[02:26:28.157 --> 02:26:32.799]  For the point to where the globalists, the group above the government that carried out 9-1-1,
[02:26:35.126 --> 02:26:41.348]  To the point to where they have to carry out terror just so they can go out and attack and take over other countries.
[02:26:43.188 --> 02:27:01.272]  So understand, I've said this a hundred times, I wish absolutely no harm on a county commissioner, the president of Germany, the president of the United States, the Pope, the Easter Bunny, because they're all puppets.
[02:27:01.552 --> 02:27:03.653]  I wish to expose the system...
[02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:09.032]  As a dehumanizing fraud, you know, we have slavery in this country.
[02:27:10.332 --> 02:27:14.314]  And in 1800, about 2% of the population were against slavery.
[02:27:15.415 --> 02:27:16.095]  They were kooks.
[02:27:16.155 --> 02:27:16.735]  They were nuts.
[02:27:16.795 --> 02:27:17.576]  They were wild.
[02:27:18.056 --> 02:27:22.918]  By the way, that 2% was people like Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, who released their slaves.
[02:27:23.338 --> 02:27:24.999]  And then they get demonized for having slaves.
[02:27:26.644 --> 02:27:35.834]  The point is that it was a small minority of people that were against slavery, said it was inhuman, said it was wrong, said these people are human beings, this is horrible, this is a shame.
[02:27:36.795 --> 02:27:48.028]  Because of peaceably speaking out, getting the word out, educating people, for decades, they were able to turn public opinion around against it.
[02:27:48.934 --> 02:27:56.276]  In fact, some of the violence that was carried out against slavers actually helped install it longer.
[02:27:56.796 --> 02:27:58.757]  It almost disappeared in the 1830s.
[02:28:01.178 --> 02:28:14.062]  So you've got to understand that, that peaceably we just keep saying the world is round, like Galileo said, and they cannot suppress the fact that the world is round forever.
[02:28:14.082 --> 02:28:15.142]  Again, I'm using an analogy.
[02:28:16.132 --> 02:28:21.755]  We have just got to continue to be bold, to be loving, to stand against this evil.
[02:28:22.235 --> 02:28:24.476]  Hate is not going to power us.
[02:28:25.236 --> 02:28:26.577]  Hate is not going to get the job done.
[02:28:26.597 --> 02:28:33.900]  Now, certainly, you have a right to defend yourself against criminals and against people that are assaulting you and assaulting your family.
[02:28:34.761 --> 02:28:44.365]  But offensively, it is wrong to go after the illegitimate government.
[02:28:44.995 --> 02:28:46.617]  Because they want that.
[02:28:46.737 --> 02:28:48.058]  I mean, folks, I've proven.
[02:28:48.198 --> 02:28:49.379]  It's been in the mainstream news.
[02:28:49.459 --> 02:28:50.420]  It's in my films.
[02:28:52.101 --> 02:28:56.505]  The FBI goes out and creates clan groups in Dallas, in Alabama.
[02:28:56.565 --> 02:28:58.327]  They try to get them to carry out attacks.
[02:28:59.088 --> 02:29:02.671]  Good police find out and stop them, whether it's Fort Worth or Mobile.
[02:29:04.132 --> 02:29:04.432]  Why?
[02:29:04.512 --> 02:29:08.876]  Because they want to then have the federal government come in with crackdowns.
[02:29:11.058 --> 02:29:11.959]  They have...
[02:29:13.119 --> 02:29:18.180]  All different other types of terrorist attacks the government has been caught carrying out.
[02:29:18.220 --> 02:29:20.461]  The organized crime they've been caught controlling.
[02:29:20.501 --> 02:29:21.621]  The FBI controlling.
[02:29:21.681 --> 02:29:31.023]  Nationwide violent hitmen actually have them out carrying out hits to control the drug trade that's sent into their coffers.
[02:29:31.383 --> 02:29:34.204]  And this is scary stuff.
[02:29:34.424 --> 02:29:42.086]  But by exposing the corruption and by exposing that they are the ones that are violent and they are the ones that do the evil things...
[02:29:43.084 --> 02:29:52.238]  And by frankly seeing them martyr us is going to defeat them a lot better than offensively.
[02:29:53.845 --> 02:30:17.501]  Now, if you had half the population fully aware of the New World Order, and that we had an illegitimate government, whether it was Al Gore or George Bush, these are just puppets, and that our republic is gone, we could peaceably not go along with their system, strike, stay home, not do what they say, put in our government, remove the electronic touchscreen system, and put our republic back in place.
[02:30:18.382 --> 02:30:20.824]  And then have grand juries indict these criminals...
[02:30:21.690 --> 02:30:30.356]  Indict the people that have carried out the New World Order's aims and have them arrested and have them tried by juries of their peers and have them in prison for life.
[02:30:31.237 --> 02:30:34.059]  And we can't engage in cruel and unusual punishment.
[02:30:34.379 --> 02:30:35.239]  So they torture.
[02:30:35.319 --> 02:30:36.100]  So they're evil.
[02:30:37.041 --> 02:30:38.902]  Well, that doesn't mean that we are.
[02:30:40.323 --> 02:30:41.384]  And I want to make that clear.
[02:30:41.824 --> 02:30:44.586]  And I have a track record of saying this.
[02:30:46.201 --> 02:30:47.302]  I have counted the cost.
[02:30:47.422 --> 02:30:49.282]  I have done the best analysis I can.
[02:30:49.322 --> 02:30:50.183]  I'm a smart guy.
[02:30:50.203 --> 02:30:52.144]  I'm not the most articulate in the world.
[02:30:52.304 --> 02:30:52.944]  Some say I am.
[02:30:52.984 --> 02:30:53.684]  I don't think I am.
[02:30:53.704 --> 02:30:56.545]  I can't articulate my full understanding of this.
[02:30:56.926 --> 02:30:58.906]  I do what I do out of love.
[02:30:59.126 --> 02:31:01.267]  It is very painful to know the truth.
[02:31:01.948 --> 02:31:04.148]  Very scary to realize what we're facing.
[02:31:04.669 --> 02:31:07.570]  But I know that I'm here and I have freedom and I have liberty.
[02:31:08.687 --> 02:31:12.948]  And in all the great things that America was, because people before me sacrificed.
[02:31:13.448 --> 02:31:16.989]  Because they were disgusted by tyranny and lies and despotism.
[02:31:18.169 --> 02:31:24.791]  So I'm telling you that the physical end of this is not where it's at.
[02:31:26.131 --> 02:31:30.952]  The globalists say in their own policy reports that the mind is the ultimate battlefield.
[02:31:31.312 --> 02:31:33.153]  They have outposts in our minds.
[02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:37.211]  America's not knowing the Bill of Rights is what's destroying us.
[02:31:37.592 --> 02:31:43.895]  America's not knowing what corruption is and not being able to judge what America is today to what Russia is and saying that it's very similar.
[02:31:46.236 --> 02:31:59.083]  As they set up the last cogs, the last mechanisms of this high-tech police state, we see them trying to silence dissent by boycotts and demonization.
[02:32:00.844 --> 02:32:01.805]  We see them...
[02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:06.222]  Promoting torture and promoting arrest of those that criticize the government.
[02:32:06.803 --> 02:32:08.203]  But people aren't buying it.
[02:32:08.784 --> 02:32:11.986]  And I'm here to tell you the real conservative grassroots are waking up.
[02:32:12.266 --> 02:32:16.328]  And the liberal grassroots are waking up and realizing their parties are whorehouses.
[02:32:19.050 --> 02:32:21.191]  And so, it's got to be done.
[02:32:21.331 --> 02:32:23.232]  We've got to resist this new world order.
[02:32:23.292 --> 02:32:24.593]  We've got to stand up to it.
[02:32:24.613 --> 02:32:26.094]  But we cannot fall into their trap.
[02:32:26.804 --> 02:32:39.670]  I mean, you know, the FBI went out and found a biker gang of a bunch of drug addicts, a bunch of speed-cooking trash, and said the FBI had money and all this stuff and posed as bikers for a year and got them to change their name.
[02:32:40.031 --> 02:32:45.353]  Let's not be a motorcycle gang, the Viper motorcycle gang out west.
[02:32:46.094 --> 02:32:47.974]  Let's be the Viper militia.
[02:32:47.994 --> 02:32:48.555]  Then the FBI...
[02:32:49.870 --> 02:32:57.135]  Got them to talk about doing violent things and got them to discuss it and then had a sting on them and said, oh, they busted the Viper militia.
[02:32:59.577 --> 02:33:02.478]  You know, there's nothing more they love.
[02:33:02.498 --> 02:33:19.470]  The New York Times, October 28, 1993, reported, and it was on in the middle of the night on CBS, that this Egyptian security force agent, Salim, was hired.
[02:33:20.498 --> 02:33:37.112]  And brought to this country and paid a million two to build bombs to train drivers, and it turned out the two guys he got to drive the truck that he cooked, this is mainstream news, were legally retarded.
[02:33:38.753 --> 02:33:42.977]  They were followers of some blind sheik, Abdel Rahman,
[02:33:43.945 --> 02:33:53.670]  Who was in a two-room little hovel where 20 followers would meet a couple times a week above a pizza place.
[02:33:56.272 --> 02:34:02.255]  And this is the big evil mastermind who supposedly bombed the World Trade Centers.
[02:34:04.076 --> 02:34:06.177]  Now, when the Egyptian agent
[02:34:06.730 --> 02:34:08.672]  The CIA guy, he thought it was a sting.
[02:34:08.732 --> 02:34:11.015]  Three days before, he went to the head of the FBI in New York.
[02:34:11.035 --> 02:34:11.796]  This was in the article.
[02:34:12.336 --> 02:34:12.737]  One time.
[02:34:12.757 --> 02:34:13.878]  It was also in the Chicago Tribune.
[02:34:13.898 --> 02:34:15.660]  They're both in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[02:34:16.441 --> 02:34:17.863]  He said, okay, let's run the sting.
[02:34:18.483 --> 02:34:19.444]  Let's bust these guys.
[02:34:19.504 --> 02:34:20.265]  I've cooked the bomb.
[02:34:20.325 --> 02:34:22.187]  I've given them detonators that you gave me.
[02:34:22.708 --> 02:34:23.609]  We can bust them.
[02:34:23.989 --> 02:34:25.972]  The FBI said, no, we're pulling you off the case.
[02:34:26.532 --> 02:34:27.994]  We're going to let this go ahead and go forward.
[02:34:29.069 --> 02:34:31.331]  We might sting them inside the parking garage.
[02:34:31.351 --> 02:34:33.272]  He goes, no, that's too dangerous.
[02:34:33.312 --> 02:34:34.453]  This stuff is dangerous.
[02:34:34.893 --> 02:34:36.554]  This stuff could blow up on the way there.
[02:34:36.614 --> 02:34:37.535]  You've got to stop them.
[02:34:39.176 --> 02:34:42.218]  And he got so upset.
[02:34:42.238 --> 02:34:45.000]  It wasn't Salim, it was Salam, Ahmad Salam.
[02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:51.464]  He got so upset, and these articles are on Infowars.com, by the way, in the 911 prior knowledge section, the government terror section.
[02:34:52.190 --> 02:34:59.052]  He got so upset, he went in and recorded eight-plus hours arguing with the FBI, going, no, let's stop the bombing, no, let's stop the bombing.
[02:34:59.352 --> 02:35:11.036]  The guy with incredible courage, he was also protecting himself, we thought they were going to frame him, came out, played the recordings, gave it to the press, the feds and the state grabbed it, but it got played, it got admitted, and got swept under the rug.
[02:35:12.016 --> 02:35:18.238]  Now, by the grace of God, the literal retards that...
[02:35:19.287 --> 02:35:28.730]  They had hired, because that's all they could find was people that were retarded, didn't park the truck up against the main center support column.
[02:35:29.070 --> 02:35:32.331]  It would have brought down the entire tower and possibly the other.
[02:35:33.851 --> 02:35:35.992]  A structural damage in the bottom from the implosion.
[02:35:37.992 --> 02:35:44.394]  By the grace of God, these idiots didn't park it up against the building and thousands lived.
[02:35:45.954 --> 02:35:47.835]  Now that's a fact, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:49.068 --> 02:35:50.669]  That is an absolute fact.
[02:35:50.929 --> 02:35:52.770]  The globalists want violence.
[02:35:52.950 --> 02:35:53.410]  Israel!
[02:35:54.191 --> 02:35:54.651]  Israel!
[02:35:55.892 --> 02:36:01.735]  Yitzhak Rabin, right before his assassination, Israeli Prime Minister, admitted at Tel Aviv University, a year before his death, a few months before his death.
[02:36:02.735 --> 02:36:04.056]  We have those articles in the new film.
[02:36:04.076 --> 02:36:04.816]  They're on the website.
[02:36:04.836 --> 02:36:09.879]  We have on the PrisonPlanet.com the Israeli terror section, Israel-Hamas terror section.
[02:36:10.419 --> 02:36:12.260]  Israel founded Hamas in the early 1970s.
[02:36:14.562 --> 02:36:23.233]  They got caught right after 9-1-1 giving them weapons and bombs and telling them and allowing them to carry out bombings and attacks and protecting them.
[02:36:23.934 --> 02:36:34.066]  It is Israeli Mossad, and in many cases, it is their minions that are carrying out the bombings over there.
[02:36:34.759 --> 02:36:47.485]  And then the idiots get out there and parade in some of the copycat attacks, and this is Israel's excuse, tear up houses and kill people and shoot reporters and run over American college students.
[02:36:49.826 --> 02:36:51.306]  And I don't want to hear, oh, don't bash Israel.
[02:36:51.366 --> 02:36:52.967]  Israel's giving nuke parts to Iran.
[02:36:53.207 --> 02:36:57.049]  I mean, Rumsfeld's giving the reactors to North Korea.
[02:36:57.909 --> 02:36:59.230]  They want crises.
[02:36:59.390 --> 02:37:00.471]  Out of it, they get control.
[02:37:02.091 --> 02:37:03.572]  So understand
[02:37:04.767 --> 02:37:06.529]  That we are not revolutionaries.
[02:37:06.569 --> 02:37:07.689]  We are restorationists.
[02:37:07.730 --> 02:37:11.092]  We want America, the republic, back.
[02:37:13.734 --> 02:37:16.957]  We just want the globalists to stop what they're doing and to back off.
[02:37:16.977 --> 02:37:19.599]  And we know that when they see weakness, they attack.
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:23.042]  We know when they see ignorance, they move forward.
[02:37:23.062 --> 02:37:25.324]  And I want to advise the globalists right now.
[02:37:25.824 --> 02:37:27.886]  I want to give you some really good advice, and you can check.
[02:37:28.407 --> 02:37:30.728]  I've done 800 radio interviews since 9-1-1.
[02:37:30.748 --> 02:37:30.949]  800 now.
[02:37:34.722 --> 02:37:37.843]  I've done my own syndicated show on AM and FM's all over the country.
[02:37:39.623 --> 02:37:43.344]  I have a website that gets millions of hits a month, millions of individual hits a month.
[02:37:44.244 --> 02:37:48.405]  Let me tell you, for every 500 positive emails, I get one negative.
[02:37:48.465 --> 02:37:52.886]  And the people are so incoherent, they have probably got 80 IQs or lower.
[02:37:54.286 --> 02:37:58.127]  I have done 800 interviews, and one out of 30 callers disagrees with me.
[02:37:59.975 --> 02:38:01.779]  Folks, let me tell you something, globalists.
[02:38:01.799 --> 02:38:02.661]  You're in a lot of trouble.
[02:38:02.741 --> 02:38:06.529]  And I know most of you in government are compartmentalized, carrying out different parts of missions.
[02:38:07.245 --> 02:38:08.645]  You don't know what you're doing.
[02:38:09.025 --> 02:38:10.606]  You don't know what you're part of.
[02:38:11.006 --> 02:38:12.426]  But you see the aftermath.
[02:38:12.466 --> 02:38:15.267]  I read the Washington Times, lowest morale ever at the Pentagon.
[02:38:15.767 --> 02:38:17.747]  Why is that, despite all this hype?
[02:38:18.148 --> 02:38:23.709]  Because the men and women in there are seeing what's happening, and it doesn't make sense because the border is still wide open.
[02:38:24.249 --> 02:38:26.269]  And they know NORAD was ordered to stand down.
[02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:31.691]  They know the CIA ran a drill that morning of, quote, flying hijacked jets into New York and D.C.
[02:38:31.751 --> 02:38:32.331]  landmarks.
[02:38:33.115 --> 02:38:33.956]  That's the cover story.
[02:38:33.976 --> 02:38:39.039]  It was just a drill that morning to have NORAD stand down to the exact scenario that took place.
[02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:48.105]  You know what's going on, and if you sit there and shake and coward and sit there, you're delivering your children into a living hell.
[02:38:48.766 --> 02:38:49.887]  A hell on earth.
[02:38:50.527 --> 02:38:51.748]  Hades on earth.
[02:38:54.670 --> 02:39:00.594]  And I'm here to tell you that it's a handful, a few thousand globalist managers, a few dozen families that own this thing,
[02:39:01.713 --> 02:39:03.333]  They're counting on you being ignorant.
[02:39:03.393 --> 02:39:08.014]  If you find out they're counting on you being afraid and being cowardly, you have got to be men.
[02:39:08.455 --> 02:39:09.795]  You have got to be women.
[02:39:10.215 --> 02:39:11.795]  You have got to be strong.
[02:39:12.115 --> 02:39:25.358]  You have got to do whatever it takes to stand up against this evil and to speak out and to not be violent and to tell the truth and let them burn us at the stake if they want to in the arena.
[02:39:26.959 --> 02:39:27.459]  I'm ready.
[02:39:28.991 --> 02:39:30.593]  I believe what Jesus Christ said.
[02:39:30.613 --> 02:39:32.154]  I believe in decency.
[02:39:32.494 --> 02:39:33.775]  I believe in wholesomeness.
[02:39:34.256 --> 02:39:37.479]  And I have seen the crimes of the New World Order.
[02:39:37.859 --> 02:39:39.281]  They are so voluminous.
[02:39:39.721 --> 02:39:44.645]  The trail of abuses is so long, I could not recite them in 10,000 broadcasts.
[02:39:45.967 --> 02:39:50.611]  I am horrified in my soul at not fighting them.
[02:39:52.358 --> 02:40:00.962]  To know what they have done, to know the UN and DynCorp publicly got caught in court kidnapping 200,000 women and children.
[02:40:02.803 --> 02:40:07.925]  I would die right now to save those people.
[02:40:08.685 --> 02:40:12.427]  The globalists would have you forget that there's decency and honor in doing the right thing.
[02:40:12.747 --> 02:40:15.328]  And I'm telling you, you've got to break your conditioning.
[02:40:15.348 --> 02:40:16.649]  You've got to join humanity.
[02:40:18.112 --> 02:40:18.992]  You've got to do it.
[02:40:19.052 --> 02:40:26.436]  And the way to do it is to educate people and expose and speak out and to trust in God that His will will be done.
[02:40:26.476 --> 02:40:28.457]  And I do trust in God.
[02:40:28.517 --> 02:40:29.617]  And there is right and wrong.
[02:40:29.657 --> 02:40:30.798]  And there are heroes.
[02:40:31.698 --> 02:40:38.702]  And we've got a job in this fight against dehumanization, not just against tyranny.
[02:40:40.202 --> 02:40:41.963]  Man, I read the globalist policy reports.
[02:40:42.003 --> 02:40:45.525]  They say they're going to screen babies in utero and force abort them.
[02:40:47.469 --> 02:40:50.772]  They're going to break families up in the government training centers.
[02:40:50.792 --> 02:40:52.293]  Your kids are going to live with the public schools.
[02:40:52.393 --> 02:40:53.514]  I mean, just a decade from now.
[02:40:54.395 --> 02:40:57.538]  They're going to thumb-scan a buy-and-sell, 85% tax rate.
[02:40:57.578 --> 02:40:59.439]  It's public, official, federal plans.
[02:41:01.081 --> 02:41:03.383]  Folks, count the cost.
[02:41:03.463 --> 02:41:04.363]  Look around you.
[02:41:04.524 --> 02:41:08.507]  A total information awareness network with more surveillance than Orwell's world?
[02:41:11.089 --> 02:41:11.930]  I love this country.
[02:41:12.982 --> 02:41:15.405]  And I love the veterans that came before us that fought for liberty.
[02:41:15.965 --> 02:41:25.195]  And I'm telling you, we got a counterfeit government from the state government to the county government to the local government up to the legislative, the executive, the judicial.
[02:41:26.276 --> 02:41:27.557]  Too many people sold out.
[02:41:27.657 --> 02:41:28.919]  Too many people were whores.
[02:41:29.299 --> 02:41:30.761]  Too many people compromised.
[02:41:31.281 --> 02:41:33.924]  We've sucked to the very center of Hades.
[02:41:36.528 --> 02:41:43.917]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:44.178 --> 02:41:48.923]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:49.144 --> 02:41:54.811]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.031 --> 02:41:55.771]  We're good to go.
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:11.881]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:35.527 --> 02:42:46.256]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:42:46.437 --> 02:42:54.023]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.283 --> 02:42:57.406]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:42:57.666 --> 02:43:03.449]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:43:03.709 --> 02:43:09.852]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:43:10.232 --> 02:43:14.114]  The Berkey light is transparent so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:43:14.154 --> 02:43:16.035]  The water level is always visible.
[02:43:16.235 --> 02:43:22.181]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:43:22.421 --> 02:43:26.365]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:44:41.420 --> 02:44:44.242]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:44:44.442 --> 02:44:46.923]  Back tomorrow, 1 to 4, I do a Saturday show with John Stattmiller.
[02:44:47.003 --> 02:44:47.624]  Look, folks.
[02:44:48.604 --> 02:44:49.505]  Putin got caught.
[02:44:50.245 --> 02:44:56.709]  Moscow police arrested FSB, the new KGB, planting bombs in a fourth Moscow apartment building.
[02:44:57.130 --> 02:44:57.950]  They took him to jail.
[02:44:57.990 --> 02:44:58.490]  They had him.
[02:44:59.051 --> 02:45:02.453]  Putin's police raided it, arrested the cops, took the bombs.
[02:45:03.694 --> 02:45:04.354]  That's a fact.
[02:45:05.325 --> 02:45:09.687]  No, government has to blow up its own stuff as an excuse to crack down on you.
[02:45:09.807 --> 02:45:10.768]  Figure that out.
[02:45:11.428 --> 02:45:12.228]  Understand that.
[02:45:12.268 --> 02:45:13.409]  The Northwoods plan.
[02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:16.330]  And they're going to carry out more.
[02:45:16.370 --> 02:45:16.931]  They've got to.
[02:45:16.951 --> 02:45:23.214]  The corruption I've seen, it's a no-return terminal velocity.
[02:45:23.794 --> 02:45:24.894]  You have got to speak out.
[02:45:24.934 --> 02:45:26.055]  You've got to stand up.
[02:45:26.555 --> 02:45:28.236]  If you serve them, they'll crush you.
[02:45:29.136 --> 02:45:32.058]  The only thing we can do is fight, and fight in a smart way.
[02:45:33.656 --> 02:45:36.017]  And pray for the enemies of liberty as well.
[02:45:36.117 --> 02:45:55.905]  Pray that their hearts will be turned, those that aren't totally blackened, turned towards humanity and that they will hesitate in carrying out their wicked activities and that all of their designs and all of their corruptions in the deepest sea be tossed up on the shore so we can all see it.
[02:45:56.565 --> 02:45:57.665]  We've got to pray, folks.
[02:45:58.066 --> 02:45:59.186]  We've got to get the word out.
[02:45:59.986 --> 02:46:00.847]  We've got to believe.
[02:46:00.867 --> 02:46:01.807]  We've got to be wholesome.
[02:46:01.847 --> 02:46:02.668]  We've got to be good.
[02:46:02.728 --> 02:46:05.010]  It's not being weak to be good like they believe.
[02:46:05.330 --> 02:46:06.311]  It's good and decent.
[02:46:06.331 --> 02:46:15.097]  It creates happiness and systems of creativity, but they don't want that because they want you under their control, and you've got to be a mindless slave to be under their control.
[02:46:15.117 --> 02:46:18.919]  They're just really sick, and we've got to fight them.
[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:20.501]  We've got to get the word out.
[02:46:21.121 --> 02:46:21.962]  Who's up next, Mark?
[02:46:24.083 --> 02:46:25.184]  Kevin in Pennsylvania.
[02:46:25.204 --> 02:46:25.844]  You're on the air.
[02:46:25.904 --> 02:46:26.485]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:46:26.985 --> 02:46:28.926]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:46:28.946 --> 02:46:29.507]  Can you hear me?
[02:46:30.219 --> 02:46:30.899]  Yes, I can.
[02:46:31.399 --> 02:46:36.220]  I'd like to say that next week, the 20th, I'm going to a Homeland Security luncheon.
[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:38.440]  I just sent out for my tickets to the post office.
[02:46:38.521 --> 02:46:40.721]  I was just at the post office to send out for my tickets.
[02:46:41.901 --> 02:46:44.542]  Is this where you learn how to be a good slave and report on your neighbors?
[02:46:45.142 --> 02:46:56.524]  And I'm going to take my road to tyranny and be like, look, everyone needs to see the road to tyranny and everyone needs shortwave radios because, you know, and I'll ask questions like, oh, what about the KGB heading up Homeland Security?
[02:46:57.024 --> 02:46:57.584]  You know, I...
[02:46:58.416 --> 02:47:02.138]  I want to mention... What else did I want to mention?
[02:47:03.319 --> 02:47:07.801]  Yeah, I want you to take 50 copies of Road to Tyranny and hand it out to everybody.
[02:47:07.861 --> 02:47:09.102]  I only have one VCR.
[02:47:09.662 --> 02:47:10.763]  I can't copy it yet.
[02:47:10.783 --> 02:47:12.084]  You need to buy another one.
[02:47:12.664 --> 02:47:14.945]  Pay the 50 bucks, buy the blank tapes, and do it.
[02:47:15.305 --> 02:47:18.267]  Yeah, I know, but I don't even have 50 bucks.
[02:47:18.687 --> 02:47:20.008]  Well, go to your neighbor.
[02:47:20.088 --> 02:47:20.368]  Get it.
[02:47:20.408 --> 02:47:21.369]  Do whatever you have to.
[02:47:21.389 --> 02:47:22.149]  All right.
[02:47:23.934 --> 02:47:24.675]  Let me see, let me see.
[02:47:25.496 --> 02:47:32.642]  Oh, yeah, did you say something one day about the Mark of the Beast Company having a, what do you call it, a mascot?
[02:47:34.183 --> 02:47:38.327]  Yeah, it's Mr. Chippy and the Chipsons and the Get Chip promotion.
[02:47:38.347 --> 02:47:39.088]  I've got to let you go.
[02:47:39.388 --> 02:47:40.209]  Got some other callers.
[02:47:40.229 --> 02:47:40.769]  Good points.
[02:47:40.849 --> 02:47:41.450]  God bless you.
[02:47:41.730 --> 02:47:42.591]  Take a video camera.
[02:47:42.611 --> 02:47:43.492]  Shoot some video of it.
[02:47:43.532 --> 02:47:44.673]  Borrow one if you have to.
[02:47:46.394 --> 02:47:48.196]  They have the family called the Chipsons.
[02:47:49.182 --> 02:47:55.223]  Who took the chips, and the Plot Digital Solutions, of course, is based in Communist China, really owned by IBM.
[02:47:56.224 --> 02:47:57.804]  Let's talk to Curtis in Texas.
[02:47:57.824 --> 02:47:58.424]  You're on the air.
[02:47:58.464 --> 02:47:58.884]  Go ahead.
[02:47:59.964 --> 02:48:00.804]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:48:00.964 --> 02:48:01.405]  Fine, sir.
[02:48:01.965 --> 02:48:02.865]  That's great, man.
[02:48:02.885 --> 02:48:11.667]  Hey, look, you have so many topics hitting at one time, and it's all excellent because you're hitting so many points.
[02:48:13.347 --> 02:48:18.028]  The one thing that we have to realize, though, and that people are totally forgetting,
[02:48:18.814 --> 02:48:19.074]  You're right.
[02:48:19.134 --> 02:48:25.236]  What I'm saying is that we need to educate people about the nature of this evil in this resistance.
[02:48:25.376 --> 02:48:26.137]  Absolutely.
[02:48:26.157 --> 02:48:26.657]  They're blind.
[02:48:26.697 --> 02:48:27.197]  They're blind.
[02:48:48.848 --> 02:48:58.694]  It's happening so blatantly right in their face, and they refuse to accept the fact that this New World Order is really taking over.
[02:48:58.714 --> 02:48:59.554]  It really is.
[02:48:59.734 --> 02:49:01.015]  I appreciate the call amount of time.
[02:49:01.375 --> 02:49:04.057]  It's like Monday's Knight Ritter headline, Knight Ritter newspapers.
[02:49:04.657 --> 02:49:06.238]  Neocons call for New World Order.
[02:49:06.258 --> 02:49:07.559]  Well, it's not the Neocons.
[02:49:08.251 --> 02:49:09.632]  Yeah, they're just the puppets of the day.
[02:49:09.652 --> 02:49:13.835]  When they say Ashcroft wants Patriot Act II, no, the globalists want Patriot Act II.
[02:49:14.375 --> 02:49:17.457]  Don't be diverted by just these low-level puppet nobodies.
[02:49:18.077 --> 02:49:21.439]  Be focused on the real power, the New World Order bankers.
[02:49:21.780 --> 02:49:22.500]  God bless you all.
[02:49:22.540 --> 02:49:23.080]  Have a good weekend.
[02:49:23.100 --> 02:49:24.201]  See you back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:25.822 --> 02:49:28.144]  We've all heard how important calcium is for the body.
[02:49:28.344 --> 02:49:31.766]  Calcium builds strong bones and teeth and fights off osteoporosis.
[02:49:31.986 --> 02:49:36.689]  But what you may not have heard is that over 200 degenerative diseases are linked...
