[00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:06.706]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:15.063]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:16.803]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:18.624]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.264 --> 00:00:20.085]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:22.746]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:26.047]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:30.648]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.611]  Well, well, well, my friends.
[00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:40.553]  It's already Thursday, the 5th of June, 2003.
[00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.915]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:50.900]  We'll be live the next three hours, and we're going to take a lot of calls and cover a ton of vital news and information.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:02.047]  Our neocon, open borders, gun-grabbing, government-expanding president is going to be traveling to Iraq, and they're trying to keep it quiet.
[00:01:02.842 --> 00:01:07.227]  Perhaps he'll even unveil a weapons of mass destruction find.
[00:01:08.108 --> 00:01:18.639]  And Attorney General John Ashcroft, the butcher of the Bill of Rights, is before the Congress, and he wants broader anti-terror powers.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.083]  He wants the power to execute people.
[00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:27.161]  That's right, secretly arrest them, not release their names, and execute them.
[00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:29.303]  Now, they're already arguing this in federal court.
[00:01:29.803 --> 00:01:38.150]  Patriot Act 1 has many of the provisions, but he's arguing for Patriot Act 2 while saying it doesn't exist as the bills are enrolled in the Senate.
[00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:42.053]  And it integrates with that story from two weeks ago, U.S.
[00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:43.995]  plans death camp.
[00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:46.016]  Or about a week and a half ago, U.S.
[00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:49.777]  plans death camp out of the mail on Sunday in Reuters.
[00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:50.657]  The U.S.
[00:01:50.697 --> 00:01:58.360]  has floated plans to turn Guantanamo Bay into a death camp with its own death row and execution chamber for citizens as well.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.561]  Hey, sounds like freedom, doesn't it?
[00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:02.702]  Secret execution centers for citizens.
[00:02:03.162 --> 00:02:04.483]  No one knowing who grabbed you.
[00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:09.305]  It sounds like what America is all about.
[00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.993]  Some good news because of conservatives, real conservatives, forcing Bush in the neocon's hand.
[00:02:16.093 --> 00:02:23.099]  Partial birth abortion ban passes the House, but it's got holes you can drive A18 Wheeler through, unfortunately.
[00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:24.080]  A lot of holes in it.
[00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:27.783]  Interesting story out of Harper's Magazine.
[00:02:27.803 --> 00:02:29.064]  I already knew about this group.
[00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.232]  It's kind of your Bohemian Grove slash Skull and Bones front group.
[00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:39.279]  It's a Christian group who likes Nietzsche, Hitler, and Mao Zedong.
[00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.664]  They say these are good leaders, and it's got most of your Christian conservative leaders are members of it.
[00:02:44.684 --> 00:02:52.972]  It was founded by the CIA back in the 50s, and they let Harper's come and watch them and cover what they do in DC.
[00:02:54.386 --> 00:02:57.348]  They're kind of coming out with Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones now, too.
[00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.951]  And they call themselves Christians.
[00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:07.636]  They call for a one-world government run by a secret leader who will be Jesus Christ in the flesh, they say.
[00:03:08.297 --> 00:03:08.977]  That's right.
[00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:14.501]  Sounds like the Antichrist, but hey, it's, you know, turning your guns in as conservative?
[00:03:14.922 --> 00:03:19.245]  Then a secret one-world leader who supports Hitler and Stalin and Mao?
[00:03:20.077 --> 00:03:21.298]  No, it's Christian!
[00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:24.279]  We're learning the new definitions now.
[00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.222]  And we'll be discussing that as well today.
[00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:35.485]  We're posting a story from Guerrilla News Network and Harper's on InfoWars.com.
[00:03:36.686 --> 00:03:38.787]  They especially love Nietzsche.
[00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:45.971]  Of course, he hated Christians and said they were the worst scum on earth, but that's really who they follow because they're Christians.
[00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:55.475]  And they are calling for a secret one-world government, and they were founded by the CIA and control most your major Christian organizations.
[00:03:56.556 --> 00:03:58.137]  Surprise, surprise.
[00:03:58.577 --> 00:04:14.191]  But from what they say about themselves, I would call it Satanism, but again, I would call gun-grabbing... I would say that wasn't conservative, but in the new world, putting your guns in, massive regulation and taxation, that's conservatism.
[00:04:15.032 --> 00:04:19.954]  In skull and bones of Bohemian Grove, Satanism is the highest form of Christian conservatism.
[00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:23.656]  So I'm beginning to learn here on the air.
[00:04:23.676 --> 00:04:27.878]  I'm beginning to understand how to be a better conservative.
[00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:36.162]  Okay, so that's coming up to just a massive show today for you.
[00:04:37.162 --> 00:04:39.083]  Also, they're going to install a puppet media.
[00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:43.563]  In Iraq, occupiers propose an Iraqi Code of Conduct.
[00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:47.065]  They're going to appoint people and then call it an election.
[00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:48.706]  Appoint leaders and call it an election.
[00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:50.647]  Global tax on guns.
[00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:52.028]  I haven't gotten to this in the last few days.
[00:04:52.088 --> 00:04:52.568]  I will.
[00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:55.530]  More on a new 9-1-1 movie.
[00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.810]  Paints Bush as a hero.
[00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.914]  And it's written by our good buddy Lionel Chetland who threatened me on the set of Conspiracy Zone in Los Angeles.
[00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:05.535]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:08.437]  Seattle protesters decry secret police and more.
[00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.356]  Some people believe a group of wealthy men control political parties, the American media, and the wealth of our nation.
[00:05:16.776 --> 00:05:17.477]  Is this true?
[00:05:18.038 --> 00:05:22.963]  Dr. Stanley Monteith spent 40 years studying secret societies and subversive movement.
[00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:29.109]  He lived in Africa for three years, and when he returned home, he studied the writings of the men who shaped the modern world.
[00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.251]  His book, Brotherhood of Darkness,
[00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:35.193]  Identifies the people who control the world and the organizations they created.
[00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:43.036]  Dr. Monteith exposes the movement behind Rhodes Scholarship, the origin of the Council on Foreign Relations, and the myths surrounding communism.
[00:05:43.356 --> 00:05:45.977]  He discusses the goal of all covert organizations.
[00:05:46.237 --> 00:05:51.059]  So if you read Brotherhood of Darkness, you will learn a secret that has been passed down through the centuries.
[00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:57.162]  When you learn this secret, you will understand what the future holds, and what you must do to help preserve our nation.

[00:05:59.683 --> 00:06:02.265]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:15.670]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.632]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:06:21.892 --> 00:06:27.153]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:06:27.434 --> 00:06:31.555]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:06:31.755 --> 00:06:35.540]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.446]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:46.794]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:06:46.834 --> 00:06:48.657]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:51.219]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[00:07:02.946 --> 00:07:04.928]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:07:05.188 --> 00:07:06.729]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:09.030]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:12.933]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation.
[00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:15.815]  But during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:07:16.534 --> 00:07:22.361]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:07:22.682 --> 00:07:24.023]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:31.513]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:07:31.773 --> 00:07:35.978]  Potassium Iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[00:07:36.198 --> 00:07:38.540]  It works by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.444]  This shields the thyroid and protects it from absorbing the radioactive iodine-131.
[00:07:43.644 --> 00:07:50.550]  There's only one emergency thyroid blocker formulated for babies, children, pets, and adults, and that's Medical Corps Potassium Iodate.
[00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.013]  Best of all, unopened bottles can be stored for up to a decade.
[00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:57.696]  Order the official Medical Corps Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.541]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:03.222]  Big Brother.
[00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:03.962]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:03.982 --> 00:08:05.043]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:05.063 --> 00:08:05.984]  You want answers?
[00:08:06.004 --> 00:08:06.585]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.663 --> 00:08:26.266]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:30.950]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.052 --> 00:08:34.293]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:34.673 --> 00:08:37.755]  Welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:39.517]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:40.117 --> 00:08:42.679]  We'll be live for the next two hours and 51 minutes.
[00:08:42.739 --> 00:08:44.601]  I hope you'll stay with us.
[00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:49.425]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central and back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:50.499 --> 00:08:54.182]  And of course it's a rebroadcast of the daytime show from 1 a.m.
[00:08:54.222 --> 00:08:55.203]  until 4 a.m.
[00:08:55.844 --> 00:08:57.826]  Central Standard Time as well.
[00:08:58.046 --> 00:08:59.207]  Now, U.S.
[00:08:59.307 --> 00:09:00.448]  plans death camp.
[00:09:00.488 --> 00:09:04.731]  That was out of Reuters and the Mail on Sunday about a week and a half ago.
[00:09:04.751 --> 00:09:06.233]  I want to go back over that because
[00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:09.310]  John Ashcroft was on C-SPAN this morning.
[00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.250]  I didn't catch all of it.
[00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:15.172]  I did tape some of the clips off CNN and Fox, and I hope the people did get the C-SPAN on tape.
[00:09:15.192 --> 00:09:16.313]  They'll send me a copy of it.
[00:09:16.793 --> 00:09:21.935]  And he called for secretly arresting American citizens and executing us in secret.
[00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:28.838]  Now, this first came out about a year ago from Crawford, the Bush compound.
[00:09:28.978 --> 00:09:31.919]  They said they wanted to be able to execute terrorist suspects in secret.
[00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:33.775]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:09:34.216 --> 00:09:35.797]  Now it's in Patriot Act 2.
[00:09:36.118 --> 00:09:39.321]  The powers are in Patriot Act 1, they just don't spell it out.
[00:09:39.761 --> 00:09:44.506]  Now Ashcroft said it today, and I have his quotes here from the Associated Press.
[00:09:44.547 --> 00:09:53.696]  So, just in case you didn't know, that's 180 degrees from what America is, and what America is all about, and what the Bill of Rights and Constitution stand for.
[00:09:54.257 --> 00:09:54.357]  It's 180!
[00:09:56.076 --> 00:10:04.578]  It's on target for Stalinist Russia, Nazi Germany under Hitler, Mao's China, or what we see today in China.
[00:10:05.458 --> 00:10:08.199]  It is on target for Fidel's Cuba.
[00:10:09.079 --> 00:10:13.280]  This is what we see in Pol Pot's Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.260]  Secret arrest, secret executions.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.821]  You think, oh, that's just for terrorists.
[00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:23.802]  Well, you better find out that terrorism means having $3,000 unaccounted for that's not in the bank.
[00:10:24.474 --> 00:10:30.879]  You better find out that terrorism means any misdemeanor crime, Section 802 of the First Patriot Act.
[00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:39.124]  You better find out that they're now talking about Christian terrorists, period, all over the news in conjunction with Eric Rudolph, Eric Robert Rudolph.
[00:10:40.465 --> 00:10:47.530]  You better wake up and realize how sinister all of this is and how they're promising you more terror to legitimize all of it.
[00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:51.493]  Now that's coming up in this hour, I will cover it.
[00:10:52.410 --> 00:11:13.523]  Also, coming up in about 20 minutes when we get into the bottom of the hour segment, after the 30 to 33 break, I want to cover some stories here that were out of the Guerrilla News Network, but first broken by Harper's Magazine and their religious writer, Jeffrey Charlotte.
[00:11:14.386 --> 00:11:16.968]  When you go read his columns, he just covers different religious groups.
[00:11:17.048 --> 00:11:20.930]  Well, an organization let him watch them for several months.
[00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.471]  They're little known.
[00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:24.712]  Most of the big Christian leaders are members.
[00:11:24.732 --> 00:11:26.473]  It was founded by the CIA.
[00:11:28.246 --> 00:11:36.169]  And they believe that Nietzsche was wonderful, Hitler was good, Stalin was good, Pol Pot, all these people are good.
[00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:45.553]  They call for global dictatorship run by a secret organization and that Jesus works through people like Hitler and others.
[00:11:47.294 --> 00:11:54.157]  Now of course it's really a skull and bones slash front group of course and it's just out of control.
[00:11:54.998 --> 00:11:56.079]  And this is how they do it.
[00:11:56.119 --> 00:11:57.520]  This is how they control things.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.923]  This is what the globalists are all about.
[00:12:00.943 --> 00:12:06.688]  So you wonder why the phony Christians on TV call for microchipping, call for world government.
[00:12:07.609 --> 00:12:12.093]  You wonder why the Pope just called for a quote, new world order, protestant catholic leaders.
[00:12:12.593 --> 00:12:16.637]  You wonder why they say that secret arrest of citizens in the Patriot Act are good.
[00:12:18.152 --> 00:12:20.795]  Because, folks, they're not Christians, okay?
[00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:21.816]  Bottom line.
[00:12:22.577 --> 00:12:26.741]  And when you read the quotes by these people, and they want you to know about it.
[00:12:26.781 --> 00:12:33.147]  It's now time for the evil to come out in your face and to have you to basically accept it.
[00:12:33.708 --> 00:12:35.129]  So, that's coming up.
[00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.931]  Now, of course, they love Nietzsche.
[00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:38.553]  They talk about Nietzsche all the time.
[00:12:39.694 --> 00:12:41.416]  And Nietzsche said Christians are the worst.
[00:12:42.873 --> 00:12:51.276]  And, you know, Christ is horrible and all these other insults, but again, this is all part of the scrambling of the brain.
[00:12:54.077 --> 00:13:02.960]  We're treated to announcements all over the news of how Christian Bush is, when he's an admitted member of Skull and Bones, the Order of Death, an admitted group
[00:13:04.089 --> 00:13:07.771]  Founded in 1832 by the Order of Death of the Illuminati.
[00:13:07.791 --> 00:13:10.512]  This is mainstream USA Today, MSNBC folks.
[00:13:11.093 --> 00:13:13.794]  Founded by the German Illuminati.
[00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:15.115]  This is public.
[00:13:15.775 --> 00:13:19.817]  And so they have their little organizations and we'll be getting into this group.
[00:13:21.338 --> 00:13:25.400]  This is what this organization is all about.
[00:13:26.301 --> 00:13:33.526]  And when you read what they say, it's just absolutely amazing to know that this is going on.
[00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:50.458]  And so soon, if you don't worship world government and a secret world leader, they say, Jesus is going to be our world leader soon here, and he's going to have to have tyranny worldwide, and he's going to demand this, and all the religions work together for this world leader, because that's what Jesus wants.
[00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:52.259]  That's right.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.501]  Very, very interesting information.
[00:13:56.521 --> 00:13:57.782]  Let me just read a little bit of this.
[00:13:58.563 --> 00:14:03.806]  A lot of people have been talking about an article in last month's Harper's Magazine by Jeffrey Charlotte.
[00:14:04.907 --> 00:14:07.809]  And it's amazing.
[00:14:07.869 --> 00:14:17.175]  It's inside the 4.4 million Arlington, Virginia compound owned by a mysterious, highly connected religious group known as the Fellowship.
[00:14:17.788 --> 00:14:40.622]  Not only did Charlotte live among the members, he delved deep into the group's archives, finding evidence that the fellowship has had extensive links to such spiritually enlightened characters as Latin American dictators, death squad leaders, and Indonesia's brutal President Suharto, who was accused of killing more than half a million suspected people in the aid of the CIA.
[00:14:40.682 --> 00:14:42.163]  Just how powerful is the group?
[00:14:43.003 --> 00:14:44.604]  And what are its core beliefs?
[00:14:44.644 --> 00:14:46.085]  The answers may shock you!
[00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:58.475]  And of course, we recommend that you first go read Charlotte Harper's article, Jesus Plus Nothing, here, and then read GNN's Conversation with the Author.
[00:14:59.893 --> 00:15:06.915]  And Grilled News Network said, you went undercover into this house and who were you posing as and what were you trying to find?
[00:15:07.035 --> 00:15:07.435]  Charlotte.
[00:15:07.535 --> 00:15:08.996]  Actually, I was posing as myself.
[00:15:09.116 --> 00:15:10.456]  I write about religion.
[00:15:10.856 --> 00:15:12.297]  A friend has said, go check it out.
[00:15:12.757 --> 00:15:13.757]  It's an interesting place.
[00:15:13.977 --> 00:15:15.858]  I went not knowing the politics.
[00:15:16.218 --> 00:15:20.279]  Within a few days I began to see things were not at all what I expected.
[00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:20.619]  This was
[00:15:21.099 --> 00:15:23.400]  Connected to a pretty vast political network.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.701]  Still, it was quite a pleasant place to live.
[00:15:25.721 --> 00:15:29.943]  These people had a different approach than I did, but I was interested in learning.
[00:15:30.584 --> 00:15:33.505]  As time went on, I started hearing more and more disturbing talk.
[00:15:33.945 --> 00:15:35.946]  That's when I started keeping my ears open.
[00:15:36.026 --> 00:15:39.368]  I didn't go in undercover, but I suppose I left undercover.
[00:15:39.628 --> 00:15:41.129]  But I told them who I was.
[00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.369]  I never told a lie.
[00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.730]  Some people have called your story a hoax.
[00:15:45.131 --> 00:15:50.053]  Charlotte, I've got lots of letters from people saying this has got to be a hoax, or please tell me if it's a hoax.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:56.743]  And it says, or curiously from people who know a little too much to be saying things they are saying.
[00:15:57.443 --> 00:15:58.944]  This is, they are very explicit.
[00:15:58.984 --> 00:16:03.326]  Their goal is an invisible world organization led by Christ.
[00:16:04.026 --> 00:16:09.009]  They say, what is the group's core ideals and what is the level of secrecy involved here?
[00:16:10.655 --> 00:16:14.017]  The goal is an invisible world organization led by Christ.
[00:16:14.217 --> 00:16:15.797]  That's what they aspire to.
[00:16:16.158 --> 00:16:17.638]  They're very explicit about this.
[00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:18.799]  You look into their documents.
[00:16:19.119 --> 00:16:21.260]  I spent a lot of time researching in their archives.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.761]  Their goal is a worldwide invisible organization.
[00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:27.563]  That's their word, and that's important because it sounds so crazy.
[00:16:28.983 --> 00:16:32.625]  And they go into what this world religion wants.
[00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:35.686]  Fascism, world leaders, they don't really care what religion you are.
[00:16:35.726 --> 00:16:39.248]  And they go into how Hitler and Mao and others really were serving Jesus.
[00:16:40.137 --> 00:16:45.582]  And boy, it's interesting how the CIA helped found it and is most of their top members in what they call the CORE.
[00:16:46.903 --> 00:16:49.585]  So, it's coming up.
[00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:50.826]  It's like the neocons.
[00:16:50.846 --> 00:16:52.847]  The neocons mainly make up this group.
[00:16:53.648 --> 00:16:54.429]  Neoconservatives.
[00:16:54.989 --> 00:17:02.175]  Anti-gun, open border, massive regulation, massive government growth in size, totally outdoing Bill Clinton.
[00:17:03.696 --> 00:17:06.559]  The founders of it all admitted Trotskyites.
[00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:07.940]  That's mainstream news.
[00:17:09.182 --> 00:17:11.484]  Type in Neocon and Trotskyite in the search engine.
[00:17:12.524 --> 00:17:14.606]  And hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[00:17:14.626 --> 00:17:18.909]  But they said, oh, they decided Stalin wasn't good and became neoconservatives.
[00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:24.913]  So it's about this wicked global government agenda just saying, oh, we're Christian.
[00:17:25.333 --> 00:17:25.914]  Go with us.
[00:17:27.023 --> 00:17:32.567]  Details of this, it gets a lot worse, coming up later in the show.
[00:17:32.627 --> 00:17:34.748]  But what did John Ashcroft do today?
[00:17:34.768 --> 00:17:44.875]  Attorney General John Ashcroft asked Congress today for expanded powers to hold suspected terrorists indefinitely before trials and then to let him seek the death penalty or life imprisonment for any terrorist act.
[00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:54.042]  Ashcroft told the House Judiciary Committee that the 2001 Patriot Act signed into law September 11th attacks should also be expanded to let prosecutors bring charges against anyone who supports
[00:17:55.237 --> 00:17:58.421]  Or works with suspected terrorist groups as material supporters.
[00:17:58.841 --> 00:18:03.327]  The law has several weaknesses which terrorists could exploit, undermining our defenses, Ashcroft said.
[00:18:03.347 --> 00:18:06.951]  So that's Patriot Act II and what they've already been arguing successfully in court.
[00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:12.838]  In fact, in the new Patriot Act, you don't even have to commit a crime to be secretly arrested, secretly executed.
[00:18:14.167 --> 00:18:16.168]  But they can't get away with this if we stand up and say no.
[00:18:16.369 --> 00:18:20.151]  Ashcroft, you held up copies of Al-Qaeda's declarations of war against America.
[00:18:20.171 --> 00:18:23.574]  We're going to allow some of the names of those killed September 11th, 2000 attacks.
[00:18:23.974 --> 00:18:29.157]  The penalties in the New Patriot Act have helped the Justice Department prevent more terrorist attacks in America.
[00:18:29.658 --> 00:18:36.903]  Ashcroft also said the Department did not break any laws, despite an internal Justice Department report that criticized the government's treatment of illegal aliens.
[00:18:37.303 --> 00:18:39.825]  Now they know most of you don't care about the illegal aliens.
[00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:41.906]  They're upset about the open borders.
[00:18:41.966 --> 00:18:44.167]  They think, oh, you'll just think it's about illegals.
[00:18:44.247 --> 00:18:47.289]  It's all about citizens, folks, and about Christians.
[00:18:47.729 --> 00:18:54.112]  The main training manuals say homeschoolers, gun owners, constitutionalists, those that believe in the second coming of Christ.
[00:18:54.693 --> 00:19:02.117]  The Department of Inspector General found significant problems in the Bush Administration's actions towards 762 foreigners held in immigration violations after the attacks.
[00:19:02.637 --> 00:19:08.680]  Now what they do is, they will announce bad things they've done, say they're sorry, and then get more funding.
[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:17.174]  So that's coming up and how that integrates with this article from a week and a half ago out of Reuters and this mail on Sunday.
[00:19:17.675 --> 00:19:17.935]  U.S.
[00:19:17.975 --> 00:19:18.915]  plans death camp.
[00:19:18.935 --> 00:19:19.256]  The U.S.
[00:19:19.296 --> 00:19:24.399]  has floated plans to turn Guantanamo Bay to a death camp with its own death row and execution chamber.
[00:19:24.779 --> 00:19:31.023]  Prisoners would be tried, convicted, and executed without leaving its boundaries, without a jury, and without the right of appeal, secretly.
[00:19:31.583 --> 00:19:36.927]  Mail on Sunday newspaper reported the plans were revealed by Major General Jeffrey Miller
[00:19:37.822 --> 00:19:43.006]  Who is in charge of the 680 suspects in 43 countries including two Australians.
[00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:47.890]  Suspects have been held in Guantanamo Delta Camp on Cuba without charges for 18 months.
[00:19:49.267 --> 00:19:56.253]  Of course, some have died, and the former general over the camp, Brigadier General Rick Baucus quit, refusing to carry out torture.
[00:19:56.853 --> 00:20:06.901]  And the real Taliban and Al-Qaeda are flown out to safety out of Afghanistan on CIAC-130s, MSNBC, New Yorker Magazine, Fox News reported.
[00:20:07.342 --> 00:20:08.463]  We'll be right back with a lot more.
[00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.632]  Got $3 in your pocket?

[00:23:09.594 --> 00:23:13.396]  Hi, this is Jack Browning with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[00:23:13.676 --> 00:23:20.639]  Use a Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and a Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.420]  Take control of your own destiny.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:27.103]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[00:23:27.243 --> 00:23:28.543]  This is more than a handbook.
[00:23:28.703 --> 00:23:32.025]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[00:23:32.425 --> 00:23:33.126]  Here's the deal.
[00:23:33.366 --> 00:23:44.639]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend, and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:50.787]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918, and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[00:23:52.228 --> 00:23:57.050]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:01.252]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:24:01.632 --> 00:24:03.473]  Ask for the Freedom Handbook Special.

[00:24:05.194 --> 00:24:05.374]  Thank you.
[00:24:26.074 --> 00:24:26.914]  Good is evil.
[00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:27.814]  Evil is good.
[00:24:27.874 --> 00:24:28.614]  Black is white.
[00:24:28.655 --> 00:24:29.355]  White is black.
[00:24:29.455 --> 00:24:30.095]  Up is down.
[00:24:30.835 --> 00:24:31.475]  Down is up.
[00:24:31.535 --> 00:24:32.256]  Left is right.
[00:24:32.956 --> 00:24:33.596]  Right is left.
[00:24:33.676 --> 00:24:34.716]  That's what they tell you.
[00:24:35.697 --> 00:24:40.418]  The opposite of what America is supposed to be about is dying right now.
[00:24:41.559 --> 00:24:44.820]  That is, America is dying and that system is taking over.
[00:24:49.523 --> 00:25:03.934]  The media is going to nothing but reality TV, talking about issues of little or no significance, distracting you with petty murder trials, while the massive corruption of the global government is expanding at record rates.
[00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:09.338]  What do you think about Ashcroft saying he wants to be able to secretly arrest Americans, secretly execute you,
[00:25:09.978 --> 00:25:22.089]  Now, for not even committing terrorist acts, even unknowingly supposedly aiding organizations that quote, aid terrorists, and then the definition of terrorism is so broad it even has misdemeanors in it.
[00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.451]  What do you think about that?
[00:25:24.471 --> 00:25:24.591]  1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[00:25:32.702 --> 00:25:42.528]  Coming up, I'm going to get into this Harper story in the Guerrilla News Network interview that got even more information out from the reporter about this organization and what they're doing.
[00:25:42.548 --> 00:25:49.413]  This so-called Christian organization that has so many leaders involved in it and what they call for.
[00:25:50.613 --> 00:25:53.975]  The type of Christianity that this neoconservative government is promoting.
[00:25:55.376 --> 00:25:59.499]  Occupiers propose Iraq Media Code of Conduct.
[00:26:00.157 --> 00:26:00.697]  That's right.
[00:26:00.817 --> 00:26:15.326]  Faced with a freewheeling Iraqi media, U.S.-led occupation authority is devising a code of conduct for the press protest from Iraq journalists who endured censorship under Saddam Hussein and they worry for their newfound freedom.
[00:26:15.386 --> 00:26:18.568]  Coalition officials say the code is not intended to censor the media.
[00:26:18.628 --> 00:26:29.695]  Oh, of course, not only to control speech and to interpret speech that could incite violence and hinder efforts to build a society.
[00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:36.072]  Oh, the country is just too fragile for a journalistic free-for-all, says the U.S.
[00:26:36.112 --> 00:26:36.413]  government.
[00:26:36.453 --> 00:26:42.997]  There's no room for hateful and destabilizing messages that will destroy the emerging Iraqi democracy.
[00:26:43.077 --> 00:26:51.182]  Mike Furlong, a senior advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority, told the Associated Press all media outlets must be responsible.
[00:26:51.762 --> 00:26:51.862]  U.S.
[00:26:51.902 --> 00:26:55.124]  forces have reason to worry about instability.
[00:26:55.544 --> 00:26:57.385]  Divisions run deep in the post-war Iraq.
[00:26:57.425 --> 00:27:04.848]  A tribal society split between majority Shiite Muslims and minority Sunnis, and between Arabs, Kurds, and smaller ethnic groups.
[00:27:04.948 --> 00:27:09.290]  Plus there is a thick seam of distaste for American occupation.
[00:27:10.611 --> 00:27:13.252]  So they've had to mow down a lot of the protesters and others.
[00:27:13.912 --> 00:27:17.654]  Now to keep them all in line and they're going to take over the media, which they've basically done here.
[00:27:17.674 --> 00:27:19.115]  They're trying to buy it up here and
[00:27:20.194 --> 00:27:24.657]  Teaching police that soon hate speech will be outlawed here like it is in Europe.
[00:27:24.977 --> 00:27:28.019]  And hate speech means criticizing genetically modified foods.
[00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:36.924]  If you're a left-winger, or you just care about the food supply, it means not allowing protests of abortion clinics, period, which they already arrest you for if you do.
[00:27:37.385 --> 00:27:40.667]  Saying it's racketeering, blocking the entrance even if you're 200 feet away.
[00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:46.417]  It means not being able to demonstrate for pro-Second Amendment causes because guns are hateful.
[00:27:46.457 --> 00:27:48.638]  They're actually writing these guidelines.
[00:27:49.098 --> 00:28:00.042]  And they've passed campaign finance reform where you can't talk about political issues with, say, gun owners of America or the ACLU, regardless of what area of the political spectrum, 60 days before an election.
[00:28:00.522 --> 00:28:02.783]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:28:03.743 --> 00:28:06.804]  All part of the new freedom here in America.
[00:28:07.244 --> 00:28:08.765]  We must stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:09.716 --> 00:28:13.057]  By not allowing you to have political organizations on the show!
[00:28:14.398 --> 00:28:16.278]  And of course, what is this global body doing?
[00:28:16.298 --> 00:28:17.679]  Global tax on guns.
[00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:23.340]  Brazil, France propose international levy on arms sales to eliminate world hunger.
[00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:28.102]  They've called for a world tax to basically tax guns out of existence.
[00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:30.831]  And our government says they agree.
[00:28:31.332 --> 00:28:36.633]  And the G8 says, OK, well then we agree to you invading Iran and Syria and North Korea.
[00:28:36.673 --> 00:28:41.074]  We have more on those battle plans for World War III coming up as well.
[00:28:42.374 --> 00:28:52.917]  Some world leaders at the G8 summit meeting are floating the idea of a global tax on arms sales, including a French President Jacques Chirac suggestion of tax on gun purchases by individuals, since he's a right winger.
[00:28:53.777 --> 00:29:08.861]  In a speech at the annual meeting of the Group of Eight, G8 Brazil's President Luiz Insenio Lula da Silva, long name, pushed the arms sales tax as a scheme whereby the world's wealthiest nations would fund efforts to eliminate world hunger, reports Bloomberg News.
[00:29:09.261 --> 00:29:13.982]  The Group of Eight includes the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia.
[00:29:14.342 --> 00:29:16.623]  And by the way, they've all agreed, six of the eight,
[00:29:17.364 --> 00:29:20.825]  ...have agreed that they want to have Bill Clinton as the next Secretary General.
[00:29:20.865 --> 00:29:24.487]  Of course, we'll be happy to do that with his comrade Bush double teaming us.
[00:29:24.727 --> 00:29:26.207]  He could be in there within a year and a half.
[00:29:26.627 --> 00:29:28.048]  Guaranteed, within two and a half years.
[00:29:28.568 --> 00:29:39.992]  Citing a Brazilian paper, Bloomberg reports Luna said such taxes would create a global fund capable of giving food to those who are hungry and creating the conditions in causes of hunger.
[00:29:40.132 --> 00:29:41.613]  Oh, it's all for hunger.
[00:29:42.753 --> 00:29:44.034]  Save the children.
[00:29:45.937 --> 00:29:47.598]  Seattle protesters to cry secret police.
[00:29:47.618 --> 00:29:48.698]  We'll get to that when we get back.
[00:29:48.738 --> 00:29:50.078]  Big Brother not watching you.
[00:29:50.138 --> 00:29:51.119]  Watching your clothes.
[00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:53.019]  The Chips already tracking you and your clothes.
[00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:54.780]  We'll get involved with the Pentagon.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.041]  Some good news on Harshal Barth abortion ban coming up and the demon cult.
[00:30:00.421 --> 00:30:01.361]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.821 --> 00:30:03.442]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.342 --> 00:30:07.003]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.299 --> 00:30:12.920]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.922]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:30:19.142 --> 00:30:20.502]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:30:20.602 --> 00:30:21.162]  In fact, body.
[00:30:21.182 --> 00:30:21.202]  803-4438.
[00:30:21.222 --> 00:30:22.383]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:30:36.258 --> 00:30:41.624]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:48.993]  I want to shatter the false left-right paradigm.
[00:30:50.034 --> 00:30:50.875]  Under this government,
[00:30:52.276 --> 00:30:56.699]  The size of state, local, and federal government is growing to record levels.
[00:30:57.139 --> 00:31:04.064]  The control is becoming so massive, the feds are actually taking over major cities like New Orleans and federalizing them.
[00:31:04.124 --> 00:31:04.825]  That's public.
[00:31:04.985 --> 00:31:07.046]  The Times-Picayune, months ago, reported that.
[00:31:07.487 --> 00:31:09.608]  The entire city taken over by Homeland Security.
[00:31:09.848 --> 00:31:15.172]  They have a bill to take over every city, but they're already doing everything before they even pass the laws.
[00:31:16.644 --> 00:31:32.376]  And I want you to think about how crazy it is that Ashcroft, I have him on tape in my new film Police State 3 Total Enslavement, saying that there is no Patriot Act II, it's a lie, and that it hadn't been introduced when it's been introduced in the Senate five months ago.
[00:31:32.396 --> 00:31:34.758]  He said that months after it had been introduced.
[00:31:34.818 --> 00:31:38.801]  It's been enrolled now in the House, brought to Hastert and others.
[00:31:39.902 --> 00:31:48.325]  And then I walk out during the break and he's on CNN, a clip of him saying we must strengthen the Patriot Act.
[00:31:48.665 --> 00:31:51.826]  We need to be able to secretly arrest citizens and execute them.
[00:31:52.126 --> 00:31:54.207]  He said this in testimony.
[00:31:54.467 --> 00:31:58.568]  We posted the AP article on Infowars.com.
[00:31:59.268 --> 00:32:02.469]  So two months ago he's saying there is no Patriot Act II.
[00:32:02.709 --> 00:32:05.150]  There's no plans to expand the legislation.
[00:32:06.303 --> 00:32:09.624]  He said that before Congress, the House and Senate, in two different committees.
[00:32:09.684 --> 00:32:13.305]  I have clips from both committees, thanks to listeners that sent me the C-SPAN footage.
[00:32:14.225 --> 00:32:23.888]  And then, right after he said that, we found articles from a week before he testified in Indiana, newspapers, where he gave a speech saying, we're going to strengthen the Patriot Act.
[00:32:24.128 --> 00:32:36.012]  I mean, bold-faced lies, bigger than, read my lips, no new taxes, bigger than, I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky, let me shake my finger at you.
[00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.972]  This guy is of his father the devil!
[00:32:40.212 --> 00:32:43.614]  I mean, he is just the biggest liar I have ever seen!
[00:32:43.694 --> 00:32:46.055]  Everything that comes out of his mouth is lies!
[00:32:46.676 --> 00:32:49.838]  180's daily from what he says!
[00:32:50.858 --> 00:32:52.739]  Now, we had all the facts, they'd introduced it.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:33:00.344]  We told you about secret executions of citizens, secret arrests, anybody that says where you went can be secretly arrested and executed, misdemeanors.
[00:33:00.584 --> 00:33:06.808]  The new act says you don't have to even commit crimes, and these guys are on the news!
[00:33:07.637 --> 00:33:13.342]  He's saying they want more now after the last four months they've been saying there is no Patriot Act 2.
[00:33:15.524 --> 00:33:17.526]  So, I'm blown away here.
[00:33:17.706 --> 00:33:18.627]  I mean, what about you?
[00:33:20.028 --> 00:33:21.249]  What do we do about this?
[00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:26.154]  I've got all the FBI training manuals that they're giving right now.
[00:33:26.194 --> 00:33:30.558]  I've got FEMA on tape saying George Washington, Thomas Jefferson are terrorists.
[00:33:30.938 --> 00:33:33.000]  That type of person is an enemy of the government.
[00:33:34.193 --> 00:33:42.098]  I've got them arresting a woman at a checkpoint for having a pocket constitution, freaking out over the Declaration of Independence, saying, is this still legal?
[00:33:42.658 --> 00:33:49.062]  That's because they're actually teaching the cops and the highway patrol that this is illegal!
[00:33:51.084 --> 00:33:59.309]  This is Twilight Zone, Body Snatcher, They Live, Matrix, Brave New World, Big Brother 1984, out of control.
[00:33:59.349 --> 00:33:59.649]  It is worse!
[00:34:03.692 --> 00:34:10.600]  That all of those, uh, dystopic novels... I don't know what to say anymore.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.883]  I mean, it's just reached la-la-land levels never before seen.
[00:34:13.943 --> 00:34:18.208]  This tells me the globalist, the military-industrial complex is getting ready to spring another attack.
[00:34:18.609 --> 00:34:19.670]  So they can say, see?
[00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:24.976]  We tried to protect you, you didn't give all your rights up, and now the terrorists hit you again.
[00:34:27.362 --> 00:34:28.343]  They're not going to stop.
[00:34:28.603 --> 00:34:32.886]  You've got to call Congress and tell them, look, no more of these laws control the borders.
[00:34:34.046 --> 00:34:42.191]  The AP reported last week they're using Patriot Act 1 to grab bank accounts that have nothing to do with even crimes.
[00:34:42.591 --> 00:34:45.173]  They don't even have to list names or why they did it.
[00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:47.474]  They're grabbing your money.
[00:34:47.554 --> 00:34:49.836]  They're setting up internal checkpoints.
[00:34:49.876 --> 00:34:55.099]  They've taken over the radio and TV with the AMBER alert system that's really the EAS FEMA system.
[00:34:56.034 --> 00:34:59.977]  The former head of the FCC group over EAS on last year.
[00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:02.318]  He's now a professor up in Chicago.
[00:35:03.999 --> 00:35:13.386]  I mean, it's just total martial law being set up right now in America, and these guys are running around saying, oh, we're Christian conservatives, accept it.
[00:35:13.686 --> 00:35:15.147]  And the Democrats are all voting for it.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.064]  So, just unbelievable.
[00:35:19.565 --> 00:35:20.587]  What do they think of you?
[00:35:20.607 --> 00:35:21.810]  What do they think of your memory?
[00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.553]  What do they think of your moral compass?
[00:35:24.014 --> 00:35:27.041]  If they'll tell you for the last couple months, really four or five months.
[00:35:27.967 --> 00:35:39.611]  And testify two months ago before Congress and tell you there's no Patriot Act and Ashcroft said those that say this are aiding terrorists with lies and phantoms of lost liberty.
[00:35:39.911 --> 00:35:41.071]  They will lose their liberty.
[00:35:41.091 --> 00:35:51.715]  He even said these liars, these liars saying we're doing this, they're helping terrorists, they're spreading false information and now he's on TV admitting it!
[00:35:53.595 --> 00:35:55.136]  On TV this morning!
[00:35:56.815 --> 00:35:59.937]  If this doesn't freak you out, there's something wrong with you, America.
[00:36:03.019 --> 00:36:12.626]  But so many good, Christian, conservative Americans are totally neutralized because they're not looking at the actions of this government, Republican or Democrat, together bringing you the New World Order.
[00:36:12.966 --> 00:36:14.307]  They're listening to the rhetoric.
[00:36:16.228 --> 00:36:18.670]  And now let me get to this article I promised I'd get to.
[00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:19.410]  It's lengthy.
[00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.492]  Then I will get to your calls.
[00:36:23.513 --> 00:36:25.074]  I will get to your calls.
[00:36:25.154 --> 00:36:30.118]  The toll-free number to join us 1-800-259-9231.
[00:36:30.138 --> 00:36:46.711]  Before I get to this news and this bizarre so-called Christian organization founded by CIA shadowy figures, I want to kind of slow down here for a second and tell folks you need to get prepared.
[00:36:48.192 --> 00:36:49.252]  You need to grow a garden.
[00:36:49.272 --> 00:36:51.174]  You need to have some land, even if it's an acre.
[00:36:51.949 --> 00:36:56.112]  You need to have friends and family that's worth more than all the gold in the mountains, as I've said.
[00:36:57.913 --> 00:37:08.159]  You need to have some good firearms to defend your family from tyranny and criminals and the enemy combatants that are all around us that are posing as our saviors.
[00:37:09.858 --> 00:37:13.421]  And my friends, you need to get water filters.
[00:37:13.721 --> 00:37:15.102]  You need to do it.
[00:37:15.282 --> 00:37:17.384]  You need to call New Millennium Concepts.
[00:37:17.424 --> 00:37:26.511]  They got units that'll do 120 gallons a day, or I don't know, what, 290 bucks, that just sit in the corner of your kitchen or your garage.
[00:37:26.991 --> 00:37:30.094]  Incredible system with a black Berkey element, made in America.
[00:37:30.754 --> 00:37:32.996]  They've got the scratch and dent cell that won't be going long.
[00:37:33.016 --> 00:37:34.577]  They have a big pallet of these that fell over.
[00:37:34.617 --> 00:37:37.399]  Most of them don't even have scratches, but they just have the whole pallet's damaged.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.541]  Anything that was really damaged, they're throwing out.
[00:37:40.595 --> 00:37:40.975]  For only $149.
[00:37:41.015 --> 00:37:47.101]  The two-filter unit does about 30 gallons a day, 20-30,000 gallons in its lifetime.
[00:37:47.401 --> 00:37:50.644]  The new black super filter in it, $149.
[00:37:51.065 --> 00:37:55.328]  I would suggest you take advantage of that and the scratch and dent sale.
[00:37:55.829 --> 00:38:00.133]  They got potassium iodate in case there's a radiological release, which the glove will say is going to happen.
[00:38:00.153 --> 00:38:00.793]  I hope it doesn't.
[00:38:01.094 --> 00:38:04.276]  You take it, it blocks your thyroid so it doesn't absorb the stuff that'll kill you.
[00:38:04.517 --> 00:38:06.819]  Number one cause of death from a nuclear attack or release.
[00:38:08.266 --> 00:38:10.629]  Total free number to call and order 1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:10.649 --> 00:38:19.501]  And your purchase also supports this broadcast of the big national distributor for Berkey Products.
[00:38:20.399 --> 00:38:22.320]  And you get a great deal when you do it.
[00:38:22.481 --> 00:38:24.522]  M1M Concepts.
[00:38:24.542 --> 00:38:27.003]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:27.023 --> 00:38:27.844]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:28.304 --> 00:38:37.230]  And if you call and the operators are busy, sometimes that happens, just leave your name and number and they'll call you right back.
[00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:37.310]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:43.027 --> 00:39:01.041]  But folks, I mean, these are scary times, but if we're bold, and if we stand up, and if we tell the truth, and if we take control of our lives, and if we stand up on the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and cry out aloud, and do not go along with these systems, and take over our local governments in the political process, we can save this country.
[00:39:01.101 --> 00:39:05.264]  But if you go along with it, you will be fed on, whether you serve them or fight them.
[00:39:07.305 --> 00:39:11.949]  But again, the toll-free number to get the Big Berkies is 1-888-803-4438.
[00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:14.671]  Take advantage of that scratch-and-dent cell while it still lasts.
[00:39:14.691 --> 00:39:15.492]  It won't last long.
[00:39:15.512 --> 00:39:16.473]  888-803-4438.
[00:39:16.633 --> 00:39:21.877]  And, uh, folks, I produce nine films.
[00:39:22.317 --> 00:39:25.360]  Police state three total enslavement is two hours, thirty-seven minutes.
[00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:41.663]  About 45 minutes of it is about Patriot Act 1 and 2 and all the lying and the actual legislation and Ashcroft saying different things on TV at different times and bald-faced lying as the big government pimp he is, the front man for the New World Order takeover.
[00:39:43.351 --> 00:39:46.113]  You need to get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:39:46.133 --> 00:39:47.835]  You need to make a hundred copies of it.
[00:39:47.855 --> 00:39:50.597]  You need to get it out to friends and family and everyone in your area.
[00:39:50.657 --> 00:39:51.198]  Just get it.
[00:39:51.678 --> 00:39:54.901]  Show it to your local VFW hall, your local NRA group.
[00:39:55.341 --> 00:39:57.243]  Wake up the grassroots today!
[00:39:59.156 --> 00:40:01.119]  We've also got to expose who's behind the terror.
[00:40:01.159 --> 00:40:12.095]  The film spends about 35-40 minutes on dozens of other examples of government-sponsored terror, homeland security, government-run white slavery kidnapping rings from hundreds of mainstream articles.
[00:40:12.636 --> 00:40:14.058]  It's an incredible film.
[00:40:15.017 --> 00:40:16.337]  Two hours, 37 minutes.
[00:40:16.357 --> 00:40:26.360]  I also have Road to Tyranny, a 170 minute film on DVD, 144 minute film on VHS, about September 11th, the takeover there.
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.421]  My book, Descent into Tyranny, is only $12, about $9.11.
[00:40:30.481 --> 00:40:33.161]  230 pages, an incredible book, concentrated information.
[00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:35.722]  I've got all these great videos.
[00:40:35.762 --> 00:40:36.882]  They're $25.95.
[00:40:37.222 --> 00:40:38.602]  Order three or more, they drop down to $20.
[00:40:38.642 --> 00:40:39.183]  Take action today!
[00:40:41.841 --> 00:40:42.141]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:42.641]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:40:42.661 --> 00:40:44.742]  Or infowars.com or net to order.
[00:40:44.762 --> 00:40:48.943]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:41:08.777 --> 00:41:13.279]  Get to videos, expose the great lie, the delusion that everybody is under.
[00:41:13.299 --> 00:41:19.502]  I mean, it's incredible when you see the lies and what they've really done, the evidence of the globalists carrying out the terror.
[00:41:19.522 --> 00:41:19.582]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:20.782]  Save America!
[00:41:20.802 --> 00:41:21.062]  Stand up!
[00:41:21.122 --> 00:41:23.724]  Have the moral strength to investigate the truth.
[00:41:23.744 --> 00:41:23.784]  888-253-3139.
[00:41:23.824 --> 00:41:26.705]  Alright, now let me go ahead and get into this Harper's
[00:41:37.142 --> 00:42:02.907]  report and uh... again this is this is on InfoWars.com just posted right now the headline devil cult posing as Christian organization that's what I call it listen to their beliefs this is Jesus plus nothing undercover among America's secret theocrats and uh... a man's foe shall be they of his own household Matthew 10.3.6
[00:42:06.298 --> 00:42:11.301]  And you talk about false prophets, and this is amazing.
[00:42:12.102 --> 00:42:15.985]  This is absolutely amazing, the article that I'm about to cover.
[00:42:17.225 --> 00:42:26.171]  And I first just want to read the Gorilla News Network interview with Jeffrey Charlotte, who's a religious writer for Harper's Other Magazines.
[00:42:28.213 --> 00:42:29.714]  Let me go ahead and launch into this.
[00:42:29.834 --> 00:42:35.938]  A lot of people have been talking about an article in last month's Harper's Magazine by Jeffrey Charlotte, editor of the website.
[00:42:37.361 --> 00:42:52.599]  The co-author of the upcoming Heretics of the Bible that goes on inside the 4.4 million dollar Arlington, Virginia's mansion owned by a mysterious, highly connected religious group known as the Fellowship.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:57.425]  Not only did Charlotte live among the members, he dove deep into the group's
[00:42:58.215 --> 00:43:15.323]  Archives finding evidence that the Fellowship has had extensive links with spiritually enlightened characters as Latin American dictators, death squad leaders, and Indonesian brutal President Shahado who is accused of killing more than half a million people with the aid of the CIA.
[00:43:15.403 --> 00:43:16.723]  Just how powerful is this group?
[00:43:17.203 --> 00:43:20.285]  What are its core beliefs and answers may shock you.
[00:43:20.325 --> 00:43:22.126]  They've got 20,000 members and they don't want to grow.
[00:43:23.606 --> 00:43:27.268]  And we recommend that our readers first read Charlotte's
[00:43:28.384 --> 00:43:35.650]  Harper's article, Jesus Plus Nothing, here, and then returned to GNN's conversation with the author.
[00:43:37.331 --> 00:43:41.094]  And we have both the articles posted on InfoWars.com, GNN.
[00:43:41.594 --> 00:43:44.116]  You went undercover into this house.
[00:43:44.816 --> 00:43:48.859]  Who were you posing as, and what are you trying to find?
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.241]  Actually, I was posing as myself.
[00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:52.662]  I write about religion.
[00:43:52.722 --> 00:43:54.544]  A friend said, go check it out.
[00:43:54.804 --> 00:43:55.785]  It's an interesting place.
[00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:56.285]  I went.
[00:43:57.466 --> 00:44:03.332]  Not knowing the politics, within a few days I began to see things were not at all what I expected this was.
[00:44:03.632 --> 00:44:05.154]  Wait till we get to the details of this.
[00:44:06.315 --> 00:44:09.618]  This was connected to a pretty vast political network.
[00:44:09.698 --> 00:44:12.040]  Still, it was quite a pleasant place to live.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:17.546]  These people had a different approach than I did, but I was interested in learning at the time.
[00:44:19.127 --> 00:44:21.970]  So I started hearing more and more disturbing talk.
[00:44:22.549 --> 00:44:24.750]  That's when I started keeping my ears open.
[00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:33.554]  I didn't go in undercover, but I suppose I left undercover, but I told them... It says, but I told them who I was and I never told a lie.
[00:44:34.174 --> 00:44:37.255]  Some people have called your story a hoax.
[00:44:37.435 --> 00:44:49.980]  Charlotte, I've got lots of letters from people saying, this has got to be a hoax, or please tell me if it's a hoax, or curiously from people who know a little too much to be saying the things they are saying.
[00:44:50.921 --> 00:44:51.461]  Now remember,
[00:44:52.293 --> 00:45:01.997]  Bohemian Grove Club and the San Francisco Chronicle, Santa Rosa Newspaper, and then National TV on Trio Network admit I snuck in, admit I went into the Grove.
[00:45:02.437 --> 00:45:09.881]  The President and others admit they go, but still Christians will deny it exists and will challenge me saying, are you a Christian for saying this about Bush?
[00:45:10.461 --> 00:45:14.863]  When it's admitted in Washington Times that it's a satanic cult, but oh, they're just having fun.
[00:45:16.149 --> 00:45:17.609]  So it's like this with all these groups.
[00:45:17.709 --> 00:45:18.449]  Now let me continue.
[00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:19.790]  They are very explicit.
[00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:21.010]  This is from the article.
[00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:24.391]  The goal is an invisible world organization led by Christ.
[00:45:25.251 --> 00:45:26.071]  GNN.
[00:45:26.351 --> 00:45:30.732]  What are some of this group's core ideas and what level of secrecy is involved here?
[00:45:31.272 --> 00:45:31.712]  Charlotte.
[00:45:32.232 --> 00:45:35.333]  The goal is an invisible world organization led by Christ.
[00:45:35.773 --> 00:45:36.993]  That's what they aspire to.
[00:45:37.033 --> 00:45:40.474]  They are very explicit about this if you look into their documents.
[00:45:41.315 --> 00:45:44.057]  And I spent a lot of time researching into their archives.
[00:45:44.157 --> 00:45:46.419]  Their goal is a worldwide invisible organization.
[00:45:46.819 --> 00:45:50.342]  That's their word, and that's important because it sounds too crazy.
[00:45:50.542 --> 00:45:59.369]  Now remember, they say in the article that they're not worried about abortion, they're not worried if people are Christians, they're not worried just that there's a world dictatorship.
[00:45:59.409 --> 00:46:07.715]  They actually say this, and that Stalin and Mao and Hitler were actually good guys, and we can learn from them and their loving work.
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.721]  And that it's just about Christ.
[00:46:09.761 --> 00:46:11.922]  When you say, but Hitler's bad, they go, it's Christ.
[00:46:12.442 --> 00:46:13.202]  It's Christ.
[00:46:13.682 --> 00:46:14.503]  It's Christ.
[00:46:15.143 --> 00:46:16.483]  You just go, oh, it's Christ.
[00:46:16.944 --> 00:46:17.604]  Oh, but it's Christ.
[00:46:17.624 --> 00:46:20.365]  That's why it's Jesus plus nothing is the headline.
[00:46:20.405 --> 00:46:23.266]  It's all just, we support global dictatorship and secret government.
[00:46:23.646 --> 00:46:24.487]  It's for Christ.
[00:46:24.787 --> 00:46:26.087]  This is what Christ wants.
[00:46:27.428 --> 00:46:30.349]  They've got all these world leaders involved, Christian leaders, you name it.
[00:46:31.218 --> 00:46:38.222]  What they mean when they say a world organization led by Christ is that literally you just sit there and let Christ tell you what to do.
[00:46:38.842 --> 00:46:45.706]  More often than not, that leads them to a sort of paternalistic benign fascism.
[00:46:45.746 --> 00:46:50.008]  There are a lot of places that they've done good things, and that's important to acknowledge.
[00:46:50.048 --> 00:46:50.869]  This is the liberals.
[00:46:51.089 --> 00:46:52.029]  They're pretty good, they say.
[00:46:52.249 --> 00:46:53.550]  Oh, they like Nietzsche, they say.
[00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:57.092]  Oh, he hated Christians, but see, that's what they're about, it says.
[00:46:57.887 --> 00:47:09.860]  But that also means that they might be involved with General Suharto in Indonesia, and if that means that God leads him to kill half a million of his own citizens, then, well, it would be prideful to question God leading them.
[00:47:10.655 --> 00:47:11.115]  CNN.
[00:47:11.135 --> 00:47:13.056]  Who are these guys and how many of them are there?
[00:47:13.456 --> 00:47:13.876]  Charlotte.
[00:47:13.896 --> 00:47:18.197]  The only estimate was made by Charles Coulson, Nixon's chief dirty tricks guy.
[00:47:18.497 --> 00:47:21.118]  Went on to become the head of the prison fellowship ministries.
[00:47:21.558 --> 00:47:26.560]  Right before he went to prison, the founder of the fellowship, Doug Coe, turned him on to Christ.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:33.162]  Coulson said there are also about 20,000 people involved in the U.S., but you aren't really supposed to talk about it.
[00:47:33.959 --> 00:47:36.821]  I've always said in interviews that it's not a conspiracy.
[00:47:37.322 --> 00:47:39.484]  There's no secret badge or anything.
[00:47:39.564 --> 00:47:40.685]  It's just a lucer.
[00:47:42.066 --> 00:47:48.612]  This is how the vast right-wing conspiracy works, by bringing associates and friends.
[00:47:50.077 --> 00:47:51.558]  Again, this is the left looking at it.
[00:47:51.638 --> 00:47:54.401]  Everything this group really stands for is ultra-socialist and liberal.
[00:47:54.441 --> 00:47:59.545]  Continuing, GNN, but they speak of themselves as operating in a terrorist-like cells.
[00:47:59.665 --> 00:48:00.426]  Yes, they do.
[00:48:01.027 --> 00:48:03.349]  Inside your cell, you might know six or eight guys.
[00:48:03.449 --> 00:48:06.131]  It's about using useful idiot Christians that think you're doing the Lord's work.
[00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:08.273]  Let me give you a real quick history.
[00:48:08.293 --> 00:48:09.154]  In 35, Abraham Verday
[00:48:12.998 --> 00:48:14.619]  Verdae starts it.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.063]  By the 40s it has about a third of Congress attending a weekly prayer meeting.
[00:48:19.083 --> 00:48:21.124]  In the 50s he gets Eisenhower's support.
[00:48:21.144 --> 00:48:24.347]  Then we get into the Los Angeles Times reporting on the CIA founding of it.
[00:48:24.887 --> 00:48:25.808]  It's all coming up.
[00:48:26.469 --> 00:48:27.910]  CIA founding the modern version in 50.
[00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.371]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:31.383 --> 00:48:35.044]  How many of you listening would give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[00:48:35.564 --> 00:48:36.404]  Listen up, folks.
[00:48:36.525 --> 00:48:39.926]  If you're taking vitamins in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:48:40.306 --> 00:48:45.707]  You see, according to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are just 10% absorbed.
[00:48:46.047 --> 00:48:50.689]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, you're literally flushing $90 down the toilet.
[00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:58.174]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, and if you want to start absorbing the nutrients that you swallow, you need to take Sea Silver.
[00:48:58.614 --> 00:49:07.441]  Not only does it contain every vitamin, mineral, amino acid, and enzyme known to man, but because it's in organic liquid form, it offers a 98% absorption.
[00:49:07.761 --> 00:49:10.964]  Now what that means is your body gets to keep the nutrients that you swallow.
[00:49:11.364 --> 00:49:13.345]  Try delicious tasting Sea Silver today.
[00:49:13.766 --> 00:49:16.268]  You'll feel a difference in two weeks or your money back.

[00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:21.211]  1-888-887-2063.
[00:49:22.052 --> 00:49:27.575]  Isn't it time you stopped flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[00:49:27.595 --> 00:49:28.275]  1-888-887-2063.
[00:49:28.555 --> 00:49:42.923]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:49:43.143 --> 00:49:50.727]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:50.967 --> 00:49:54.129]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:49:54.389 --> 00:50:00.132]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:50:00.412 --> 00:50:06.575]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:50:06.935 --> 00:50:10.836]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:50:10.876 --> 00:50:12.777]  The water level is always visible.
[00:50:12.957 --> 00:50:18.879]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:50:19.119 --> 00:50:23.380]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:50:32.759 --> 00:50:40.143]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:50:40.403 --> 00:50:45.166]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:50:45.386 --> 00:50:51.029]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:50:51.249 --> 00:50:55.791]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:50:56.012 --> 00:51:03.175]  The cashless society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:03.195 --> 00:51:03.976]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:51:04.016 --> 00:51:07.718]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:07.878 --> 00:51:10.399]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:10.619 --> 00:51:17.343]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:17.563 --> 00:51:25.225]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:25.445 --> 00:51:28.806]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:29.006 --> 00:51:40.209]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:43.789]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:46.281 --> 00:51:52.249]  Now, I haven't gotten into the meat of this news article about the CIA taking over the Christian organization Front Group.
[00:51:53.462 --> 00:51:59.747]  I'm going to keep reading from it, and early in the next hour, I will start going to your calls, Doug in West Virginia and others that are patiently holding.
[00:52:00.107 --> 00:52:02.109]  The toll-free number to join me on this subject is 800-259-9231.
[00:52:02.129 --> 00:52:16.700]  I'm going to get more into the chilling statements about how the Patriot Act must be strengthened today before Congress by John Ashcroft, who said Patriot Act II didn't exist after it was already enrolled, introduced in the Senate, and passing through committee.
[00:52:18.361 --> 00:52:19.382]  But continuing,
[00:52:20.185 --> 00:52:22.713]  According to a 2002 Los Angeles Times article during the 1950s...
[00:52:24.515 --> 00:52:26.836]  The founder played a major role in the U.S.
[00:52:26.876 --> 00:52:36.219]  government's anti-communist activities, but really that was about the government controlling the anti-communist activities and keeping it away from people finding out the government was behind the centralization of power.
[00:52:36.519 --> 00:52:48.282]  The Pentagon officials secretly met at the group's Washington Fellowship House in 1955 to plan a worldwide anti-communism propaganda campaign endorsed by the CIA documents from the Fellowship Archives and the Eisenhower Presidential Library Show.
[00:52:48.903 --> 00:52:51.483]  They known as the International Christian Leadership.
[00:52:51.883 --> 00:52:53.284]  The group financed a film called
[00:52:54.305 --> 00:52:57.887]  Militant liberty that was used by the Pentagon abroad.
[00:52:57.907 --> 00:53:04.790]  This is how they beguiled young Christians to join the CIA and fight communism when really our own government put Mao into power.
[00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:07.711]  Showing faith in discretion.
[00:53:08.291 --> 00:53:10.452]  Lisa Getter, Los Angeles Times, wrote about that.
[00:53:11.673 --> 00:53:13.914]  It's sort of stabilized now.
[00:53:13.954 --> 00:53:16.715]  By the mid-60s, they sort of realized they didn't want too many people.
[00:53:16.755 --> 00:53:18.315]  Too many people dilute the organization.
[00:53:19.216 --> 00:53:21.657]  On scene, I saw one congressman, Todd,
[00:53:22.415 --> 00:53:27.799]  T. Hurt, a Republican from Kansas who seemed as if he was interviewing to be in the organization.
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.481]  He was very nervous.
[00:53:29.561 --> 00:53:34.905]  The leader of the organization was asking him questions, sort of leading back to and testing him.
[00:53:34.925 --> 00:53:42.751]  I think he wanted into this network and he wanted and would fumble a little by talking about abortion.
[00:53:42.911 --> 00:53:44.733]  They don't really care about abortion.
[00:53:45.093 --> 00:53:47.535]  They are against it, but they aren't really concerned about it.
[00:53:47.555 --> 00:53:49.897]  See, it's just a transitory diversionary issue for them.
[00:53:50.993 --> 00:53:54.236]  The Episcopalian Old Boys Network was a lot more easygoing.
[00:53:54.256 --> 00:53:58.239]  This is a lot more militaristic at its core, almost monarchist.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.541]  What are their core issues?
[00:54:01.862 --> 00:54:07.046]  The writer Charlotte, this is from Harper's, the core issue is capitalism and power.
[00:54:07.126 --> 00:54:09.428]  The core issue, they would say, is love.
[00:54:10.009 --> 00:54:12.190]  There are a lot of different things love means.
[00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:14.933]  They will always work with both sides of the issue.
[00:54:15.433 --> 00:54:18.776]  I saw some correspondence with the Chinese officials before Ding
[00:54:19.511 --> 00:54:21.232]  John Ping was in power.
[00:54:22.052 --> 00:54:30.475]  They had some very clandestine associates with senior Chinese officials and were told Ding was a guy they could do business with, so that was fine with them.
[00:54:31.235 --> 00:54:35.196]  When you say do business, was it all about actual business deals?
[00:54:35.416 --> 00:54:47.320]  Charlotte, well, I wouldn't say it was all about business deals, but if you happened to be praying with someone and you were doing praying and said, hey, I have some F-16s to sell, they would deny there is any connection.
[00:54:47.944 --> 00:54:50.105]  They are pretty careful about those kinds of things.
[00:54:50.185 --> 00:54:54.568]  They would never say, we are out here to help you set you up in business.
[00:54:54.608 --> 00:54:57.049]  They will always help out their friends.
[00:54:57.149 --> 00:54:58.470]  Let me introduce you to someone.
[00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:00.471]  The Prime Minister of Malaysia is coming.
[00:55:01.149 --> 00:55:08.093]  And it goes on, GNN, it sounds to me like some sort of Extended Skull and Bones, Old Boys Network, crafted into religious context.
[00:55:08.173 --> 00:55:10.315]  Charlotte, the religious context is real.
[00:55:10.335 --> 00:55:12.796]  The Old Boys Network is about business.
[00:55:12.856 --> 00:55:14.217]  This is about more than business.
[00:55:14.257 --> 00:55:20.281]  This is about maintaining a certain kind of power, a certain view of how power can be distributed.
[00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:24.372]  The Episcopalian Old Boys Network was a lot more easygoing in this.
[00:55:24.433 --> 00:55:26.114]  This is more about militaristic.
[00:55:26.534 --> 00:55:29.736]  Really, at its fundamental core, almost monarchist.
[00:55:30.157 --> 00:55:34.019]  We would be told time and time again, Christ's Kingdom is not a democracy.
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:35.901]  This is their model for leadership.
[00:55:36.201 --> 00:55:40.264]  They would often say, everything you need to know about government is right here in the cross.
[00:55:40.684 --> 00:55:42.606]  It's vertical, not horizontal.
[00:55:42.646 --> 00:55:43.847]  So that means command and control.
[00:55:45.067 --> 00:55:45.228]  CNN.
[00:55:46.952 --> 00:55:53.075]  In that vein, regarding your article, I got the impression these guys like Adolf Hitler and Genghis Khan a lot.
[00:55:53.615 --> 00:55:55.596]  Is that a fair assessment of your intention?
[00:55:55.897 --> 00:55:59.158]  In fact, the writer says, Harper's made me cut back on that stuff.
[00:55:59.458 --> 00:56:03.320]  They said, we know it's true, but this is already so much to absorb.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:10.064]  That's why I included the line at the end of the story, the leader of the group is having dinner with the younger members of the group, and it is talking about a
[00:56:10.624 --> 00:56:11.044]  Bond.
[00:56:11.124 --> 00:56:12.105]  The Covenant, he says.
[00:56:12.445 --> 00:56:14.205]  Anyone think of anyone else who had a covenant?
[00:56:14.245 --> 00:56:16.826]  The answer was, of course, everyone knows it's Hitler.
[00:56:17.046 --> 00:56:20.248]  They wanted to say that Hitler... Well, I'll tell you what they said about Hitler when we get back.
[00:56:22.148 --> 00:56:25.610]  What if you could actually save money on everything you ever needed to buy?
[00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:28.071]  Sounds unbelievable, but you can.
[00:56:28.291 --> 00:56:31.612]  At www.homeshopgroup.com.
[00:56:31.852 --> 00:56:39.555]  Get your free... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:44.301 --> 00:56:44.782]  He's responding.
[00:56:47.263 --> 00:56:47.904]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.564 --> 00:56:49.625]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.325 --> 00:56:51.466]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.106 --> 00:56:52.907]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.667 --> 00:56:54.588]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.608 --> 00:56:59.071]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:03.534]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:06.096 --> 00:57:08.597]  Alright, we're talking about a group founded in the late 1930s.
[00:57:10.916 --> 00:57:12.277]  Taken over by the CIA in the 1950s.
[00:57:12.397 --> 00:57:15.038]  I haven't even gotten to the meat of the article yet.
[00:57:15.658 --> 00:57:18.179]  It's kind of the neocon, phony Christian movement.
[00:57:18.459 --> 00:57:23.721]  You know, Bush worships and prays to Allah at a mosque, this whole line.
[00:57:23.761 --> 00:57:24.921]  They work with dictators.
[00:57:24.961 --> 00:57:26.162]  They work with all these groups.
[00:57:26.642 --> 00:57:28.603]  They're not really concerned about abortion.
[00:57:29.083 --> 00:57:32.544]  But they say, do what we say because, you know, we're controlled by Jesus.
[00:57:32.904 --> 00:57:37.126]  We call for a secret world government run by the followers of Christ.
[00:57:38.027 --> 00:57:39.811]  Uh, calling for world dictatorships.
[00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:45.102]  We're talking about this and it's really getting into the meat now of this article.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.361]  And it continues.
[00:57:47.621 --> 00:57:50.303]  In fact, Harper's made me cut back on that stuff.
[00:57:50.343 --> 00:57:56.006]  They said, we know it's true, talking about love of Hitler, this is already so much to absorb.
[00:57:56.066 --> 00:57:58.748]  That's why I include that line at the end of the story.
[00:57:58.768 --> 00:58:04.572]  The leader of the group is having dinner with the younger members of the group and is talking about the bond, the covenant.
[00:58:04.612 --> 00:58:07.513]  He says, can anyone think of anyone else who had a covenant?
[00:58:07.553 --> 00:58:09.495]  And the answer, of course, everyone knows is Hitler.
[00:58:09.995 --> 00:58:10.856]  This goes back to the 60s.
[00:58:12.119 --> 00:58:17.221]  And when they were instructing young men by having them read the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, look at what those guys did!
[00:58:17.241 --> 00:58:21.103]  But they will say, we are not trying to kill Jews.
[00:58:21.503 --> 00:58:29.867]  What we're talking about is, imagine if you took the Hitler concept, and they'll use that phrase, that Hitler concept, to work for Christ.
[00:58:30.827 --> 00:58:32.228]  Or the Mao concept.
[00:58:33.008 --> 00:58:34.489]  We're not right-wingers, they say.
[00:58:34.509 --> 00:58:36.990]  We can use the Mao concept.
[00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:38.811]  Now this is the new Christian system.
[00:58:40.006 --> 00:58:44.250]  Define what that means by Hitler concept they say to Charlotte who is writing for Harper's.
[00:58:44.851 --> 00:58:50.076]  A loyal leadership cadre which is interested because guys like Hitler and Stalin were famous for purging.
[00:58:51.198 --> 00:58:53.019]  But they seem to be focused on a couple of guys.
[00:58:53.219 --> 00:58:55.721]  If two or three agree, it's a phrase they use a lot.
[00:58:56.121 --> 00:58:59.042]  If you can get together and focus, you can accomplish anything.
[00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:00.903]  You need to sway the electorate.
[00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:03.385]  You don't need to convert everyone to Christ.
[00:59:03.465 --> 00:59:04.946]  Everyone doesn't have to believe in Christ.
[00:59:05.506 --> 00:59:07.687]  And that's where they differ from other fundamentalists.
[00:59:08.067 --> 00:59:11.209]  Some fundamentalists really distrust them for what they say.
[00:59:11.249 --> 00:59:12.470]  We need to convert everyone.
[00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:14.711]  The high and the low, the family says,
[00:59:15.623 --> 00:59:17.084]  No, we don't need the high.
[00:59:17.744 --> 00:59:26.049]  All these guys, Hitler, Lenin, Pol Pot, and Osama Bin Laden is another guy they cite a lot, are guys who understood the power of a political avant-garde.
[00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:39.077]  That's why they mean by the Hitler concept, keeping your message simple, and repeating it again and again, because this is the only one message, and it is Jesus loves, and we need a world dictatorship.
[00:59:39.497 --> 00:59:40.478]  Jesus loves you?
[00:59:41.098 --> 00:59:41.979]  Talk about a cult!
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.641]  You can express lots of different things that way.
[00:59:45.061 --> 00:59:50.622]  I always try to play the devil's advocate, and the article goes on, they are not the traditional right-wing bad guys.
[00:59:50.742 --> 00:59:52.143]  Oh no, the liberal says they're good.
[00:59:52.803 --> 00:59:58.405]  They have been able to do what they do for so long because no one has been looking for this kind of thing.
[00:59:58.425 --> 01:00:00.485]  A lot of this is already in the culture.
[01:00:00.545 --> 01:00:06.247]  Take the book Genghis Khan Business Secrets, for instance, the administration of authoritarian leaders.
[01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:08.391]  Here's where I'm confused.
[01:00:08.491 --> 01:00:12.253]  The GNN writer says, to me they sound like Nietzsche.
[01:00:12.273 --> 01:00:13.975]  They don't sound like Jesus Christ.
[01:00:14.555 --> 01:00:19.038]  They sound like they're creating a Nietzschean Superman above the moral universe the rest of the slaves live in.
[01:00:19.978 --> 01:00:22.080]  I don't think I mentioned Nietzsche in the article, do I?
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.161]  I don't think so.
[01:00:23.241 --> 01:00:24.882]  That's really perceptive of you.
[01:00:25.302 --> 01:00:26.443]  Many of them love Nietzsche.
[01:00:26.463 --> 01:00:27.764]  They think he's fascinating.
[01:00:27.784 --> 01:00:29.866]  I don't want to talk about all they talk about is Nietzsche.
[01:00:30.246 --> 01:00:31.367]  But he hated Christianity.
[01:00:31.407 --> 01:00:32.768]  He was the ultimate amoralist.
[01:00:33.269 --> 01:00:34.230]  I know it's weird.
[01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:37.973]  This is where one really wacky fundamentalist group that thinks
[01:00:39.174 --> 01:00:40.996]  Doug Coe could be the Antichrist.
[01:00:41.016 --> 01:00:41.998]  They're not sure yet.
[01:00:42.378 --> 01:00:46.403]  They might need to shave his head and see if he has the mark of the beast.
[01:00:46.544 --> 01:00:49.848]  They say Christians think this is the Antichrist group.
[01:00:49.868 --> 01:00:51.350]  Well, it's one arm of it, obviously.
[01:00:52.345 --> 01:00:57.209]  I mean, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, oh, they're good.
[01:00:57.289 --> 01:00:59.931]  Nietzsche, abortion, we don't worry about that.
[01:01:00.431 --> 01:01:02.673]  World government, secret world government's good.
[01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:04.495]  Now, it really gets bad.
[01:01:04.535 --> 01:01:10.499]  Some of the members, your governors, your congressmen, your presidents, the CIA, and they're controlling it.
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:16.404]  Bringing in world leaders to speak to them up at the cedars, up at their woodland abode.
[01:01:18.544 --> 01:01:20.885]  A lot of Grove members, a lot of Skull and Bones members.
[01:01:21.005 --> 01:01:22.365]  See what this is really all about?
[01:01:24.486 --> 01:01:26.006]  Oh, this is so scary, folks.
[01:01:27.006 --> 01:01:27.706]  Heaven help us.
[01:01:28.627 --> 01:01:31.347]  I haven't even gotten to the scary, scary part yet, folks.
[01:01:32.848 --> 01:01:37.109]  It'll take about another six, seven minutes to read this on the other side, then we'll talk to Doug, Ed, and others.
[01:01:37.509 --> 01:01:38.509]  Call for your number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:01:42.637 --> 01:01:49.442]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:01:49.803 --> 01:01:51.164]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:01:51.364 --> 01:01:53.566]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:01:53.726 --> 01:01:55.827]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:01:56.088 --> 01:02:01.031]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:02:01.352 --> 01:02:05.395]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:02:05.635 --> 01:02:07.417]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:02:07.497 --> 01:02:18.149]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:20.172]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:02:20.572 --> 01:02:24.254]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowars.

[01:02:58.744 --> 01:02:59.104]  I think so.
[01:03:18.933 --> 01:03:19.173]  I think so.
[01:03:40.928 --> 01:03:43.949]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:49.192]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:03:49.452 --> 01:03:53.794]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:03:54.094 --> 01:04:03.018]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:04:03.218 --> 01:04:06.820]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:12.162]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:04:12.442 --> 01:04:19.185]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:04:19.666 --> 01:04:20.046]  What about you?
[01:04:20.974 --> 01:04:26.318]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:04:43.934 --> 01:04:49.956]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:50.556 --> 01:04:53.617]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:54.598 --> 01:05:01.440]  Alright, for the last 25 minutes or so, I have been covering an article about a group called the Brotherhood.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:07.442]  A lot of Skull and Bones people, a lot of CIA people involved in the founding and promotion of it.
[01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:11.391]  They talk about Nietzsche all the time, how great he is.
[01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:14.233]  Of course, he hates Christians and is kind of a little devil himself.
[01:05:14.733 --> 01:05:15.493]  They like Mao.
[01:05:15.534 --> 01:05:16.414]  They like Hitler.
[01:05:16.994 --> 01:05:18.235]  They like Soharto.
[01:05:18.255 --> 01:05:20.036]  They don't care if you're a Christian, a Muslim, whatever.
[01:05:20.076 --> 01:05:27.660]  If you're calling for world dictatorship, they believe Jesus needs a world dictatorship to come among us and be our leader.
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.000]  Okay?
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:31.802]  And they control a lot of the big Christian organizations.
[01:05:33.522 --> 01:05:35.604]  You talk about anti-Christ counterfeits, this is it.
[01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:36.384]  So they continue.
[01:05:37.378 --> 01:05:40.640]  So they've gotten into a trouble with a lot of evangelical groups.
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:44.161]  They invited Yasser Arafat to the National Prayer Breakfast.
[01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:50.004]  They boasted they have special permission from the State Department to bring anyone they wanted to the Cedars.
[01:05:51.104 --> 01:05:53.466]  And they love to get Osama Bin Laden down there.
[01:05:53.986 --> 01:05:55.887]  I know it's weird that they love Nietzsche.
[01:05:56.267 --> 01:06:01.049]  There is one really wacky fundamentalist group that thinks they're the anti-crunch.
[01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:02.650]  Continuing...
[01:06:03.439 --> 01:06:04.019]  GNN.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.361]  But where does Christ fit into all of this?
[01:06:06.481 --> 01:06:10.804]  It seems like a lot of Old Testament, meat shall inherit the earth, Jesus part.
[01:06:11.304 --> 01:06:12.525]  That's an interesting point for me.
[01:06:12.565 --> 01:06:16.968]  Jesus is just a regular guy, a buddy, a spirit guide, a guide.
[01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.949]  Oh!
[01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:26.334]  The standard evangelical stuff, no sex, is part of a weird, hipster, puritanical view.
[01:06:26.475 --> 01:06:28.996]  If you met them, you wouldn't think they were upright.
[01:06:29.156 --> 01:06:29.937]  See, they're not into that.
[01:06:29.957 --> 01:06:31.338]  They're not against abortion either, you see.
[01:06:32.502 --> 01:06:40.088]  Actually, they sound like complete, it goes on, and they continue, but they seem like they can't stand women.
[01:06:40.769 --> 01:06:45.572]  Charlotte says, this is the writer for Harper's, they're just not that interested.
[01:06:45.632 --> 01:06:48.094]  It's a very gendered point of view.
[01:06:48.154 --> 01:06:49.035]  Jesus is everywhere.
[01:06:49.095 --> 01:06:51.697]  Jesus is right there with you on the basketball court.
[01:06:52.563 --> 01:06:56.026]  But at an upper level, there is this weird emphasis on the Old Testaments.
[01:06:56.226 --> 01:06:56.967]  It's in the story.
[01:06:57.007 --> 01:07:00.931]  They talk about King David, who in some ways was really a bad guy.
[01:07:01.271 --> 01:07:04.995]  They are really interested in the biblical concept that whether you were good or bad, it doesn't matter.
[01:07:05.315 --> 01:07:07.297]  What matters is whether you were chosen.
[01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:09.679]  This part of the Hitler concept.
[01:07:09.739 --> 01:07:12.201]  It doesn't matter whether Hitler was good or bad.
[01:07:12.241 --> 01:07:13.763]  Hitler was chosen for leadership.
[01:07:14.283 --> 01:07:15.524]  That was part of God's plan.
[01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:17.626]  Nothing happens that isn't part of God's plan.
[01:07:17.746 --> 01:07:17.886]  GNN.
[01:07:18.747 --> 01:07:23.628]  Let's cut to this house where these six congressmen are living in C Street in D.C.
[01:07:24.388 --> 01:07:26.589]  What is their connection, if any, to the Bush administration?
[01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:33.391]  The White House seems to have its own relationship with the religion and people who are influencing them on religious issues.
[01:07:33.631 --> 01:07:35.091]  Is there a relationship here?
[01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:35.551]  Charlotte?
[01:07:35.591 --> 01:07:35.851]  Yes.
[01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:38.952]  I would say it is not exclusively Democrat or Republican.
[01:07:40.372 --> 01:07:42.833]  They say there are six guys at C Street House.
[01:07:43.593 --> 01:07:45.314]  There were eight of them when I was there.
[01:07:45.374 --> 01:07:46.734]  They say there is one member,
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.603]  of Parliament, England, and there are similar ones in other capitals.
[01:07:51.643 --> 01:07:53.825]  The House is constantly rotating.
[01:07:54.686 --> 01:07:56.387]  Steve Largent used to live there.
[01:07:56.587 --> 01:08:02.712]  John Elias Baldocchi, a conservative Democrat, who is now the governor of Maine.
[01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:09.438]  As for Bush's connection, there is Ashcroft, I discovered in their archives, a correspondence between Ashcroft and Coe that began in 81.
[01:08:09.978 --> 01:08:14.141]  Al Gore at one time referred to Doug Coe as his personal hero, which is easy to believe.
[01:08:14.201 --> 01:08:16.023]  Doug Coe is an incredibly charming man.
[01:08:17.202 --> 01:08:18.643]  See, all of them together, folks.
[01:08:18.803 --> 01:08:22.065]  The Bushes have visited the Cedars many times, but all Presidents have.
[01:08:22.545 --> 01:08:27.048]  Bush Senior, when he was Vice President, was hosting dinners for Middle Eastern Ambassadors there.
[01:08:27.628 --> 01:08:30.830]  They are doing, and they are going to people at all levels.
[01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.611]  GNN.
[01:08:31.851 --> 01:08:33.892]  When you say someone is part of it, what does that mean?
[01:08:33.972 --> 01:08:34.853]  Are you in or out?
[01:08:35.173 --> 01:08:36.093]  Or is it a loose thing?
[01:08:36.413 --> 01:08:36.834]  Charlotte.
[01:08:36.934 --> 01:08:39.615]  It's a loose thing, but there are levels of participation.
[01:08:39.635 --> 01:08:40.696]  See, just like the Masons.
[01:08:41.036 --> 01:08:41.937]  Different rooms.
[01:08:42.217 --> 01:08:43.057]  Pyramidal structure.
[01:08:43.598 --> 01:08:45.759]  Are they confined like the Masons or something?
[01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:47.190]  That goes on.
[01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:52.332]  There is an inter-corps group that is confined in their documents called the Corps.
[01:08:52.372 --> 01:08:55.473]  I don't know who it is other than Doug Coe.
[01:08:55.514 --> 01:09:00.595]  The documents I saw only went up to the late 80s with senators, congressmen, a lot of military men.
[01:09:00.635 --> 01:09:04.237]  Before he died, Senator Harold Hughes was the Corps.
[01:09:05.211 --> 01:09:09.113]  Former Senator Mark Hatfield used to be the Corps, and many still are.
[01:09:09.713 --> 01:09:13.315]  In the AP article, there is an Air Force officer who I hadn't known about.
[01:09:13.735 --> 01:09:19.038]  There are other associates, usually about 150 associates, and they are all key individuals in key areas.
[01:09:19.498 --> 01:09:24.880]  And then there are people who are in the cell with the associates, and they are called very close.
[01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:26.941]  And then there are close friends.
[01:09:26.981 --> 01:09:32.024]  Senator James Inhofe, Republican from Oklahoma, is frequently, for instance, referred to as a close friend.
[01:09:33.014 --> 01:09:37.456]  President Musevi of Uganda is a close friend.
[01:09:37.816 --> 01:09:48.599]  There's no relationship card, membership card, in all of their letters there is a paragraph that says this is private confidential relationship and we don't talk about it when they are required a new person into the group.
[01:09:48.619 --> 01:09:50.740]  It's like CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.861]  All those top members are also members.
[01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:57.202]  Are there formal events and meetings other than the National Prayer Breakfast?
[01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:57.842]  Charlotte.
[01:09:58.042 --> 01:09:59.643]  There are literally thousands of governors.
[01:10:01.528 --> 01:10:05.211]  Mayor's prayer breakfasts around the country.
[01:10:05.231 --> 01:10:08.433]  So again, there are thousands of prayer breakfasts with governors and mayors around the country.
[01:10:08.814 --> 01:10:17.660]  Some of those probably lunched 40-50 years ago and have long since lost their connection to the mothership, as it were.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.361]  But that's the idea.
[01:10:19.461 --> 01:10:20.902]  They are part of a movement.
[01:10:21.223 --> 01:10:26.266]  The system is in place that we could turn to God to make all our decisions.
[01:10:26.326 --> 01:10:27.327]  The Spirit Guide.
[01:10:27.447 --> 01:10:27.848]  Hitler.
[01:10:27.888 --> 01:10:28.448]  Stalin.
[01:10:29.269 --> 01:10:29.569]  Mao.
[01:10:31.087 --> 01:10:36.966]  Up until the 1970s, they had core meetings around the world, but that's as far as I saw the documents.
[01:10:38.459 --> 01:10:46.521]  Indonesia, El Salvador, Brazil, it's kind of hard to name a nasty regime around the world that doesn't have really well-documented connections to them.
[01:10:46.541 --> 01:10:48.202]  And remember, they call for purges.
[01:10:48.282 --> 01:10:49.182]  Purges are good.
[01:10:49.302 --> 01:10:54.983]  Jesus needs a world dictatorship run by a secret government to come in the flesh and save us.
[01:10:55.383 --> 01:10:56.964]  He must have a world dictatorship.
[01:10:57.264 --> 01:11:01.765]  Then the loving leader will arrive, and he's not against abortion.
[01:11:03.081 --> 01:11:05.423]  CNN, so how scared are you of this group?
[01:11:05.483 --> 01:11:10.528]  Are they a force of fascism or some sort of cult-like group with connections that comes and goes?
[01:11:10.648 --> 01:11:13.370]  Charlotte, I think they are definitely a force for fascism.
[01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:17.174]  I think a lot of the way the world works is a result of their work.
[01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:18.915]  They're instrumental in getting U.S.
[01:11:18.935 --> 01:11:23.559]  government support for General Chuhardo, for the Generals Juntas in Brazil.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.303]  Just take those two countries alone, they are two of the biggest countries on Earth.
[01:11:27.876 --> 01:11:32.278]  Those countries might have progressive democracies a long time ago was not for the U.S.
[01:11:32.298 --> 01:11:33.539]  support of those regimes.
[01:11:33.639 --> 01:11:34.219]  GNN!
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:36.901]  But don't you think the CIA and the U.S.
[01:11:36.921 --> 01:11:39.962]  government own agenda has a lot to do with those decisions?
[01:11:40.042 --> 01:11:41.983]  Yeah, but they made those connections.
[01:11:42.784 --> 01:11:45.165]  What are the connections between the CIA and the Fellowship?
[01:11:45.205 --> 01:11:45.605]  Charlotte.
[01:11:45.685 --> 01:11:50.448]  A lot of their key men in the country would be in the intelligence officers in the American Embassy.
[01:11:50.968 --> 01:11:55.070]  Throughout their correspondence, that's the kind of guy they would like to have involved.
[01:11:55.976 --> 01:11:58.259]  They always had a lot of army intelligence guys involved.
[01:11:58.279 --> 01:11:59.100]  Pentagon guys.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:06.369]  Doug Coe in the early 70s was touring the front lines of Vietnam with intelligence officers and South Vietnamese generals.
[01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:08.872]  That's the level of connections they are talking about.
[01:12:10.621 --> 01:12:26.624]  Salvadorian General Carlos Ugrinos, Dines Casanova, connected by Florida jury from the torture of thousands, convicted, and Honduran General Gustav Alvarez Martinez, a minister also linked to the CIA and death squads.
[01:12:26.984 --> 01:12:29.065]  They are the people who brought these people in.
[01:12:29.405 --> 01:12:31.225]  They said, you need to meet this person.
[01:12:31.265 --> 01:12:32.185]  That's how it works.
[01:12:32.825 --> 01:12:35.106]  Tex Mars has made films and written books about this.
[01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:40.067]  Now, a lot of the so-called Christian coalition, the top Christian groups, the big TV channels,
[01:12:40.672 --> 01:12:52.897]  We're actually down there supporting this, and then the CIA funds the communists to create the crisis, then they come in the name of fighting communists, young moronic Christians are control compartmentalized in the system and carry out the exterminations.
[01:12:52.917 --> 01:12:58.118]  A lot of the so-called people that train the torture and death squads at Fort Benning, Georgia think, oh, it's for Jesus.
[01:12:58.579 --> 01:12:59.339]  See how this works?
[01:13:00.583 --> 01:13:04.307]  Their diplomacy can affect some good things, like the truce in Rwanda.
[01:13:04.367 --> 01:13:08.010]  They had a lot of connections with the South African Apartheid regime.
[01:13:08.631 --> 01:13:11.573]  They were generally a moderate, even a progressive force.
[01:13:11.613 --> 01:13:13.655]  See, they can create a crisis rather than a solution.
[01:13:14.396 --> 01:13:21.243]  But it's kind of hard to say a name, a nasty regime around the world that doesn't have really well documented connections to them.
[01:13:21.623 --> 01:13:25.767]  Franco was a holdout, so they started winning over a bunch of ministers in the Franco regime.
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:30.861]  And then went to Franco and said his good group we can do business with them.
[01:13:31.381 --> 01:13:33.962]  Why hasn't there been more mainstream press on this?
[01:13:34.582 --> 01:13:40.063]  Lisa Getter of the Los Angeles Times Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter did a piece on it, but there was no follow-up.
[01:13:40.143 --> 01:13:43.024]  I got a little press out of it when my article came out.
[01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:46.225]  There is a big reason there hasn't been a lot of press about it.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:51.923]  And that's the war, on the other hand, and this isn't a conspiracy theory.
[01:13:52.024 --> 01:13:54.645]  If they can't see it, then it's not there.
[01:13:55.046 --> 01:14:07.054]  I mean, if you read that your local congressman is sitting there saying Hitler is a leadership model, then your local paper should at least call up and say, Congressman, do you believe Hitler is a good leadership model?
[01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:12.758]  If he had said Norm Chomsky is a great philosopher, then there had been an investigation in a minute.
[01:14:14.361 --> 01:14:15.322]  And it gets worse and worse.
[01:14:15.362 --> 01:14:17.183]  The article goes on and on and on.
[01:14:17.223 --> 01:14:19.725]  I want to go to Doug and Ed and John and John and others.
[01:14:20.866 --> 01:14:23.829]  Why then are not following up on this?
[01:14:23.949 --> 01:14:24.469]  I don't know.
[01:14:24.569 --> 01:14:33.476]  Partly because it's so crazy and partly because there is this area that religion and politics are separate and religion is a personal thing.
[01:14:33.516 --> 01:14:36.739]  The media has always been a pretty dumb when it comes to religion.
[01:14:36.759 --> 01:14:37.660]  They're not dumb.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:38.901]  Harper is writer.
[01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:40.643]  Many of them are members.
[01:14:41.084 --> 01:14:43.848]  It's like Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, almost no reporting.
[01:14:43.868 --> 01:14:46.831]  You've got Washington Times, Parade Magazine, Sacramento Bee.
[01:14:46.871 --> 01:14:51.477]  They say, okay, they run around naked in homosexual orgies, our Christian conservative leaders.
[01:14:52.178 --> 01:14:56.103]  And David Gergen says he's not involved in it, though he saw it.
[01:14:56.764 --> 01:15:07.494]  Well, Helmut Schmidt writes in his own autobiography, Men in Powers, former German Chancellor, before Helmut Kohl and now Gerhard Schroeder, says, I love the pagan rituals, but no one even seems to know about it.
[01:15:07.534 --> 01:15:07.734]  See?
[01:15:08.054 --> 01:15:10.897]  It's so crazy that no one can handle it.
[01:15:11.337 --> 01:15:14.840]  In the New Yorker profile of John Ashcroft, they talk about his weekly prayer breakfast.
[01:15:15.161 --> 01:15:19.164]  Steve Largent, former congressman from Washington, in the New York Times, same deal.
[01:15:19.224 --> 01:15:21.867]  I think they interviewed him while he was living at the house.
[01:15:22.467 --> 01:15:23.588]  The reporter never asked.
[01:15:23.688 --> 01:15:26.109]  How did they get you involved in this?
[01:15:26.309 --> 01:15:29.090]  Is this some thing that existed for you?
[01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:34.213]  The reporter sort of implied that this was Largent's idea of a weekly prayer breakfast.
[01:15:34.813 --> 01:15:40.295]  Seven to eight top congressmen on key committees living together in a cult compound.
[01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:41.896]  And this isn't something we need to discuss.
[01:15:41.936 --> 01:15:43.637]  You know, they just call it a prayer breakfast.
[01:15:44.275 --> 01:15:49.237]  It hasn't been that secret the New Republic did an exposé in the late 60s, early 70s and no one really followed up.
[01:15:49.357 --> 01:15:52.939]  Robert Scheer did a piece on it in Playboy in the 1970s.
[01:15:53.539 --> 01:15:55.040]  Any fallout from the members?
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.102]  I've talked to several who swear we are still friends.
[01:15:58.782 --> 01:16:03.584]  One guy did say, I'm paraphrasing, you're a traitor and you'll be dealt with as a traitor.
[01:16:04.905 --> 01:16:13.289]  Kind of like Lionel Chetwin who's made this new miniseries made for TV movie where Bush saves us from the attacks the day of 9-1-1 and is a big hero.
[01:16:14.276 --> 01:16:19.360]  Walks up to me in the bathroom of a Hollywood set for Conspiracy Zone and says, you're Alex Jones.
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:22.382]  Makes a fist and points at me, bares his teeth.
[01:16:22.722 --> 01:16:24.443]  We're gonna get you!
[01:16:25.824 --> 01:16:28.306]  We're so Christian.
[01:16:29.827 --> 01:16:31.548]  I mean, you just talk about sick.
[01:16:32.048 --> 01:16:33.569]  Well, I'm standing up for this country.
[01:16:33.609 --> 01:16:34.370]  What about you?
[01:16:34.770 --> 01:16:37.192]  Your calls, your response to this when we get back.
[01:16:37.812 --> 01:16:39.473]  This is only the tip of the iceberg.
[01:16:40.033 --> 01:16:40.614]  Stay with us.
[01:16:45.027 --> 01:16:45.548]  It's here.
[01:16:45.828 --> 01:16:46.529]  It's powerful.
[01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:55.420]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.563]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[01:16:57.823 --> 01:16:59.925]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[01:17:00.166 --> 01:17:04.411]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[01:17:04.691 --> 01:17:10.414]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[01:17:10.594 --> 01:17:12.355]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[01:17:12.515 --> 01:17:15.776]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[01:17:15.956 --> 01:17:17.497]  Get the powerful Berkey now.

[01:18:40.939 --> 01:18:45.203]  Our Founding Fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:18:45.643 --> 01:18:50.047]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:18:50.567 --> 01:18:55.413]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:18:55.793 --> 01:18:57.595]  The Declaration in Washington D.C.
[01:18:57.635 --> 01:18:58.636]  can barely be read.
[01:18:58.656 --> 01:18:59.938]  It has faded that much.
[01:19:00.278 --> 01:19:04.183]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[01:19:04.443 --> 01:19:05.384]  We bring them to you by using
[01:19:05.384 --> 01:19:12.787]  Using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antiqued parchment paper all ready for framing.
[01:19:13.047 --> 01:19:20.910]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95 shipping included.
[01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:25.151]  And as a special gift for ordering now, you will also receive a commemorative U.S.
[01:19:25.211 --> 01:19:27.492]  Constitution proof silver dollar with your order.

[01:19:33.314 --> 01:19:34.740]  Don't wait, do it today!
[01:19:35.081 --> 01:19:35.523]  The number 800-686-2237.
[01:19:40.718 --> 01:19:44.280]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:19:44.541 --> 01:19:45.961]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:19:46.442 --> 01:19:47.883]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:19:48.143 --> 01:19:53.306]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:19:53.666 --> 01:19:58.149]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:19:58.469 --> 01:20:07.115]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:20:07.615 --> 01:20:08.755]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:20:09.216 --> 01:20:12.977]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:20:13.257 --> 01:20:19.879]  With a regular program of oral hygiene, including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:20:20.219 --> 01:20:24.261]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[01:20:24.701 --> 01:20:26.662]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:27.842]  Call toll-free 800-569-4340.
[01:20:27.882 --> 01:20:28.062]  That's 800-569-4340.
[01:20:28.122 --> 01:20:30.063]  Or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[01:20:50.245 --> 01:20:50.885]  We're back live.
[01:20:50.925 --> 01:20:52.185]  We're about to go straight to your calls.
[01:20:52.265 --> 01:20:56.686]  I just want to state this, because I'm led to warn everybody about this.
[01:20:57.486 --> 01:21:14.230]  You look at these organizations, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, the Fellowship, the Christian group that thinks all these dictators are good, and thinks that world government's good, and that then one of the members, according to the Harper's writer, threatened them after the story came out.
[01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:15.670]  They allowed the person in there for months.
[01:21:17.652 --> 01:21:18.553]  Again, they're paraphrasing.
[01:21:18.593 --> 01:21:26.504]  You're a traitor and you'll be dealt with as a traitor is what one of the members told the Harper's writer after this came out in the Harper's Magazine last month.
[01:21:28.172 --> 01:21:33.716]  And, you know, Lionel Chetwin, one of the head guys on the media board for Bush.
[01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:39.481]  I mean, I take it very seriously when he walks over to me in the bathroom and says, you're Alex Jones, we're going to get you.
[01:21:39.501 --> 01:21:46.606]  And then walks past me and I say to the deputy producer, assistant producer, I say, Chetwin just threatened me.
[01:21:46.626 --> 01:21:47.967]  And he goes, oh, I'm just joking.
[01:21:48.588 --> 01:21:50.689]  It's on the record that he admits he said that.
[01:21:51.130 --> 01:21:53.932]  I take it very serious when members of an administration
[01:21:55.433 --> 01:22:22.391]  uh... who are part of administration where Ashcroft is saying they'll arrest citizens and secretly execute them before congress saying this today I take it very serious when somebody says something like that so anything happens to me this is on the record and uh... but the problem these people have is that there is now millions of us telling the truth thousands of websites thousands of books hundreds of videos hundreds of talk show hosts more and more people telling the truth
[01:22:24.361 --> 01:22:28.144]  I've seen hundreds of mainstream news articles worldwide saying the Globalists carried out 9-1-1.
[01:22:28.204 --> 01:22:30.106]  How are you going to silence us all?
[01:22:30.486 --> 01:22:30.886]  They're not.
[01:22:31.267 --> 01:22:36.071]  The Globalists are going to carry out the higher-up echelons, more terror, try to scare us into submission.
[01:22:36.471 --> 01:22:37.512]  We've got to stand strong.
[01:22:37.532 --> 01:22:38.653]  We've got to speak out now.
[01:22:39.313 --> 01:22:41.535]  This is what's taking over Christianity in this country.
[01:22:41.615 --> 01:22:44.397]  You've got the federal payoff with the faith-based initiative.
[01:22:44.698 --> 01:22:46.219]  This is why it's getting worse and worse.
[01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:48.080]  Doug in West Virginia.
[01:22:48.661 --> 01:22:49.562]  Doug, you're on the air.
[01:22:49.602 --> 01:22:49.982]  Go ahead.
[01:22:50.751 --> 01:22:51.692]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[01:22:51.752 --> 01:22:52.512]  Feeling the love.
[01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:54.274]  I'm just really feeling the love.
[01:22:54.294 --> 01:22:56.015]  Didn't that sound like a Christian group?
[01:22:56.315 --> 01:22:56.675]  Oh, yeah.
[01:22:56.735 --> 01:22:59.257]  You know, I guess I really don't go to church enough.
[01:22:59.317 --> 01:23:06.182]  I kind of missed the day where we talked about Mao, Hitler, and Stalin's method of conduct and Moloch worship as a Christian activity.
[01:23:06.202 --> 01:23:10.024]  How do they get away with claiming that?
[01:23:10.165 --> 01:23:12.286]  Gun control is conservative.
[01:23:12.846 --> 01:23:17.430]  Well, if this type of thing doesn't cause people to run, like I'm near a
[01:23:20.402 --> 01:23:24.984]  I think we need to run for town council, for mayor, we need to take control of our neighborhoods.
[01:23:25.024 --> 01:23:26.985]  I mean, maybe even in the big cities you could do this.
[01:23:27.045 --> 01:23:30.486]  I don't know, you know, if you take control of even, say, your apartment building.
[01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:35.789]  You know, get together, have an organization and say that this is an area where the Constitution is enforced.
[01:23:35.809 --> 01:23:40.571]  Didn't you say there was a ruling, Maybury versus Madison or something, that says that any law that is
[01:23:41.161 --> 01:23:44.202]  Violates your... Constitutional rights is null and void.
[01:23:44.602 --> 01:23:46.262]  The 9th Amendment says that.
[01:23:46.322 --> 01:23:47.322]  The 10th says it.
[01:23:47.682 --> 01:23:52.103]  But, more importantly, the Declaration of Independence expressly states it.
[01:23:53.883 --> 01:23:54.063]  Yes.
[01:23:54.143 --> 01:24:05.025]  Well, you know, one interesting thing I heard the other day in the grocery store, they were running a thing that said, what is the first word of the Declaration of Independence?
[01:24:05.065 --> 01:24:06.505]  And then they gave, like, four choices.
[01:24:06.545 --> 01:24:09.786]  Like, when, let, we, whatever.
[01:24:10.239 --> 01:24:12.460]  Yes, well, I mean, we have socialist radicals in control of our government, and...
[01:24:28.208 --> 01:24:33.691]  We just, we really need to take back, I guess, theoretically, we could rebuild it from the ground up.
[01:24:33.751 --> 01:24:37.513]  I mean, hopefully, but you know, like... Well, they've got to destroy morals if we're going to accept tyranny.
[01:24:37.994 --> 01:24:41.996]  There's no better way than to have the CIA posing as all your Christian organizations.
[01:24:42.850 --> 01:24:44.811]  Well, yes, that's what they do.
[01:24:45.171 --> 01:24:48.693]  So you've got these people on the radio going, oh, the Patriot Act's good!
[01:24:48.713 --> 01:24:53.856]  I mean... Jesus needs a dictatorship!
[01:24:53.876 --> 01:24:58.078]  Left is right and up is down, and oh yes, we have to destroy something to save it.
[01:24:58.138 --> 01:25:09.364]  You know, it's like if you had, you know, if you had a baby or a baby's running out in the street and here comes a truck, say, oh no, well, I guess, I mean, you've got to try to save it.
[01:25:09.384 --> 01:25:11.586]  You've got to run out and grab it back, and that's what we need to do.
[01:25:11.626 --> 01:25:12.346]  We need to claim that
[01:25:12.884 --> 01:25:21.424]  These are our rights that are given to us by our Creator, and the government is supposed to enforce that, make sure that that is what's going on, and if it's not, then...
[01:25:21.823 --> 01:25:23.684]  We're supposed to be the government, we need to take it back.
[01:25:53.885 --> 01:26:04.053]  Well, maybe, you know, if there's a crazy man, a mad man, maybe ignoring them to a certain extent will, but I think you need to draw the line at the threshold of your house.
[01:26:04.313 --> 01:26:07.616]  They're not mad men, they're in control of the government, Republicans and Democrats.
[01:26:07.796 --> 01:26:10.518]  Al Gore and George Bush and John Ashcroft.
[01:26:11.058 --> 01:26:11.819]  They know what they're doing.
[01:26:11.839 --> 01:26:14.481]  Members of the same Christian organization.
[01:26:14.521 --> 01:26:15.101]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:16.263 --> 01:26:16.763]  Appreciate it.
[01:26:16.783 --> 01:26:19.944]  We'll come back and talk to Ed, John, John, Roy, and others.
[01:26:20.484 --> 01:26:24.065]  Call the free number to join me on air.
[01:26:24.085 --> 01:26:25.766]  800-259-9231.
[01:26:26.286 --> 01:26:30.187]  PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com are the websites.
[01:26:30.267 --> 01:26:32.388]  More your calls and a bunch of other news straight ahead.
[01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:34.328]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.768 --> 01:26:36.409]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.309 --> 01:26:39.990]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.984 --> 01:26:48.269]  Most people realize that everyday life can be pretty unpredictable at times, but that doesn't mean your business has to be.
[01:26:48.489 --> 01:26:54.836]  A quick call to GTI Technologies is all it takes to put your business far ahead of the competition with a... Call is 877-605-9200.
[01:26:54.896 --> 01:26:55.116]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:11.131]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:27:11.612 --> 01:27:14.593]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:17.395 --> 01:27:19.677]  We're dealing with a serious takeover, folks.
[01:27:20.117 --> 01:27:21.758]  I cut my teeth exposing Bill Clinton.
[01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:23.559]  Now we've got the neocons to deal with.
[01:27:24.399 --> 01:27:25.480]  Bringing this country down.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.681]  They're all on the same team.
[01:27:26.721 --> 01:27:28.042]  Bringing you a new world order.
[01:27:28.782 --> 01:27:30.303]  Much of other news coming up.
[01:27:30.583 --> 01:27:31.504]  I'll also talk about
[01:27:32.268 --> 01:27:39.453]  Again, Ashcroft now admits his Patriot Act, too, after lying all these months and wants to secretly arrest you and your family and put you in detention camps and kill you.
[01:27:39.473 --> 01:27:40.594]  That's right.
[01:27:40.634 --> 01:27:42.455]  Execute American citizens secretly.
[01:27:42.475 --> 01:27:43.335]  It's all about freedom.
[01:27:43.836 --> 01:27:44.836]  Ed in Pennsylvania.
[01:27:44.856 --> 01:27:45.777]  Ed, you're on the air.
[01:27:45.817 --> 01:27:46.297]  Go ahead.
[01:27:46.317 --> 01:27:47.138]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:48.038 --> 01:27:48.519]  How you doing?
[01:27:49.039 --> 01:27:51.781]  Did you see the cover of the TV Guide this week?
[01:27:52.081 --> 01:27:52.581]  No, I didn't.
[01:27:52.982 --> 01:27:58.165]  It's one of my favorite actors, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and half his face is cyborg'd out.
[01:27:59.252 --> 01:28:01.313]  And it's about his political ambitions.
[01:28:01.333 --> 01:28:04.093]  He's going to be running for Governor of California.
[01:28:04.453 --> 01:28:06.614]  Yeah, the son of a Gestapo officer.
[01:28:06.654 --> 01:28:13.216]  And he fixed the bill, Kurt Voltheim was an SS officer, and ran the UN from 1972 to 1982 as the Secretary General.
[01:28:13.236 --> 01:28:17.217]  So this Austrian is going to be one of our presidents in the future, you think, maybe?
[01:28:17.517 --> 01:28:24.179]  Well, they are moving to change that law, and they're moving to get rid of the 22nd Amendment, so you can stay in for 15 terms if you want, being sarcastic.
[01:28:24.919 --> 01:28:26.460]  But this is the new system.
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:27.360]  It's all part of freedom.
[01:28:28.075 --> 01:28:31.417]  Get rid of everything America was, give us tyranny, and call that freedom.
[01:28:32.178 --> 01:28:35.600]  You're quoting Nietzsche there in his movie.
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:52.730]  Well, no, this Christian group really loves Nietzsche and Hitler, and says Jesus is a spirit guide, and most of the big Christian organization leaders, Ashcroft, others, the folks that are telling you the Patriot Act's good, most of them are actually members of a group that I can only describe as satanic from what they say.
[01:28:53.571 --> 01:28:57.073]  They quote Nietzsche in the Conan the Barbarian movie, the first one.
[01:28:57.917 --> 01:29:00.318]  That which does not kill you will only make you stronger.
[01:29:00.578 --> 01:29:03.578]  Yeah, and false of doom has the all-seeing eye on his chest and everything.
[01:29:03.918 --> 01:29:06.759]  Yeah, false of doom, yeah.
[01:29:07.299 --> 01:29:09.160]  We're living in a sci-fi world, Alex.
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:18.582]  Well, really, sci-fi is all an interpretation of what the Illuminati's been doing for a long time, and what was sci-fi 50 years ago is now reality.
[01:29:18.902 --> 01:29:20.562]  Yeah, yeah, it is reality.
[01:29:20.582 --> 01:29:24.523]  What was sci-fi 5 years ago is now reality, and imagine what they're suppressing.
[01:29:25.624 --> 01:29:25.844]  Oh, yeah.
[01:29:30.569 --> 01:29:36.373]  Alex, could you give me your address over the phone?
[01:29:36.553 --> 01:29:43.898]  Sure, it's 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:29:44.058 --> 01:29:46.900]  Let me ask you a question, Ed.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:57.807]  What do you think about Ashcroft saying, yeah, there is a Patriot Act II, we want to secretly arrest citizens and execute them, it's all part of freedom, when all these months he said it didn't exist after it was already enrolled in the Senate?
[01:29:59.228 --> 01:30:02.032]  Well, they're having people call in CNN today.
[01:30:02.293 --> 01:30:05.577]  What do you think about giving up your freedom for security?
[01:30:05.777 --> 01:30:07.780]  As if you get security when you give up liberty.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.082]  No, you get slavery.
[01:30:09.542 --> 01:30:09.723]  Yeah.
[01:30:10.276 --> 01:30:18.360]  And we've given up all this liberty, we've got all this tyranny now, and they're saying brace for more attacks, and the attacks just get bigger and bigger and bigger the more funding they get.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:20.982]  They had a drug war, triple the heroin, double the cocaine.
[01:30:21.262 --> 01:30:23.743]  They had a war on illiteracy, more illiteracy.
[01:30:24.163 --> 01:30:25.704]  A war on crime, more crime.
[01:30:25.744 --> 01:30:27.725]  Yeah, it works real good, doesn't it?
[01:30:27.745 --> 01:30:35.389]  What scares me is when I leave my area here and I drive across the state, and I can't pick you up on the radio, and I realize these people out there have no
[01:30:36.238 --> 01:30:38.839]  Information coming in except what's being spoon-fed, though.
[01:30:38.959 --> 01:30:41.100]  You gotta tell them about Infowars.com.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.160]  Thanks for the call, my friend.
[01:30:42.781 --> 01:30:47.202]  You can listen to us on a growing list of AM and FM affiliates, but we don't cover a lot of the country.
[01:30:47.222 --> 01:30:47.742]  We need to.
[01:30:48.383 --> 01:30:49.943]  Satellite, shortwave, or internet.
[01:30:50.363 --> 01:30:51.984]  Let's talk to John in Colorado.
[01:30:52.484 --> 01:30:53.365]  John, you're on the air.
[01:30:53.465 --> 01:30:54.545]  How are you listening today?
[01:30:55.025 --> 01:30:56.366]  Thank you, Elmana.
[01:30:57.466 --> 01:30:59.547]  I'm on the road today, and I'm enjoying your show.
[01:30:59.667 --> 01:31:00.587]  How are you listening to the show?
[01:31:02.691 --> 01:31:03.871]  On the radio here.
[01:31:04.191 --> 01:31:04.892]  Local AM?
[01:31:05.372 --> 01:31:06.032]  Yes, AM.
[01:31:06.892 --> 01:31:07.712]  What frequency?
[01:31:08.193 --> 01:31:08.953]  1230, I'm thinking.
[01:31:08.973 --> 01:31:09.413]  Well, great.
[01:31:09.433 --> 01:31:10.113]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:31:10.133 --> 01:31:10.793]  What's on your mind?
[01:31:11.193 --> 01:31:17.195]  Okay, you definitely have a different perspective than the other radio jocks throughout the country.
[01:31:17.255 --> 01:31:18.455]  It's good, too, by the way.
[01:31:18.475 --> 01:31:24.357]  Yeah, I'm actually mad that Bush is going to re-sign the Clinton gun ban and add a semi-automatic shotgun ban.
[01:31:24.377 --> 01:31:25.557]  Yeah, I'm pretty mad about that.
[01:31:26.477 --> 01:31:30.098]  I think you're right about the seamlessness, too, of Republican and Democrat.
[01:31:30.118 --> 01:31:31.039]  I don't think it matters.
[01:31:32.527 --> 01:31:35.129]  Uh, there seems to be a lot of nepotism in the government.
[01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:43.296]  I know Cheney's daughter is got all the senior CIA types completely cowed down.
[01:31:43.336 --> 01:31:44.737]  She's in the Middle East sector.
[01:31:45.318 --> 01:31:57.128]  And now I see in your last newscast that Cheney was making repeated visits to that group prior to the Iraq War, pressuring them to say, yes, there's weapons of mass destruction, so on.
[01:31:57.788 --> 01:31:59.430]  I think that war was forced upon us.
[01:32:00.225 --> 01:32:01.747]  I think they were disarmed actually.
[01:32:02.148 --> 01:32:11.583]  Well look, they armed Saddam, they told him to invade Kuwait, he followed his orders, they gave him an amnesty deal, then refused it, then the war started, they flew him out.
[01:32:12.245 --> 01:32:13.345]  Paid them in gold bars.
[01:32:13.765 --> 01:32:18.746]  That is admitted in the foreign press, and they admit in our press they paid the Iraqi Republican Guard leadership.
[01:32:18.786 --> 01:32:19.986]  That was totally staged.
[01:32:20.406 --> 01:32:29.028]  There was a few useful idiots that fought back, or what you could say, a few people who were patriots for their country, and they got mowed down.
[01:32:29.048 --> 01:32:30.788]  It was totally staged.
[01:32:30.908 --> 01:32:32.549]  A staged war, just like Afghanistan.
[01:32:32.789 --> 01:32:35.149]  It was all CIA running the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
[01:32:35.429 --> 01:32:40.710]  In the middle of the war, they loaded them on C-130s, blew them out, bombed the people they'd conscripted to fight.
[01:32:41.251 --> 01:32:46.349]  And then took a bunch of little kids, literally, to Camp X-Ray to be tortured, and trained us that torture's okay.
[01:32:47.648 --> 01:32:52.773]  Do you think there's any possibility that the oil pipelines are actually behind everything that's happening?
[01:32:52.793 --> 01:32:54.914]  Oh, that's publicly stated by the White House, sir.
[01:32:54.975 --> 01:33:05.244]  It's the Project for the American Century, their cabinet formed before the election said, in their own quotes, Saddam is not a threat, he's a pretext to take over the oil and to use Iraq as a military launch base.
[01:33:05.484 --> 01:33:14.652]  They said we need to be hit by terrorists, large catastrophic events on the order of Pearl Harbor to convince the people to accept this war for empire and the unfolding crackdown.
[01:33:15.365 --> 01:33:21.007]  Why would our president say, I've hit the trifecta after World Trade Center and Pentagon were hit?
[01:33:21.167 --> 01:33:22.868]  That seemed like an odd thing to say.
[01:33:22.948 --> 01:33:27.390]  Well, he already knew 20 minutes before he got to the school about everything.
[01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:29.331]  He'd already been told about the second plane.
[01:33:29.351 --> 01:33:31.011]  It was totally staged, sir.
[01:33:31.051 --> 01:33:33.232]  That was so you could see the president learning of it.
[01:33:33.252 --> 01:33:34.553]  It was Hollywood theater.
[01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:37.652]  So who is behind the attack, then, do you feel?
[01:33:37.672 --> 01:33:39.193]  I don't feel anything.
[01:33:39.273 --> 01:33:44.797]  I've got two films and a book on the subject that absolutely prove the Globalists carried out 9-1-1.
[01:33:44.837 --> 01:33:50.161]  The intelligence agencies, the high-level, compartmentalized groups at the top carried the attacks out.
[01:33:50.662 --> 01:33:51.743]  Was Israel involved?
[01:33:52.483 --> 01:33:57.567]  They were involved in managing and running some of the mid-level operations, but not in the actual execution.
[01:33:58.208 --> 01:34:02.371]  That was a CIA, quote, training drill, was the smokescreen over NORAD that morning.
[01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:05.411]  Alex, I can see why they're afraid of you.
[01:34:06.992 --> 01:34:09.273]  But you've got some good information, and I keep it up.
[01:34:09.713 --> 01:34:10.813]  But you're very isolated.
[01:34:11.473 --> 01:34:16.095]  You're the only radio station I've even heard anything vaguely close to this.
[01:34:16.135 --> 01:34:24.118]  Most of it's a Michael Savage, Rush Limbaugh... Yeah, Michael Savage says, he says, put Americans in camps if they criticize the government.
[01:34:24.899 --> 01:34:25.979]  Take all their assets.
[01:34:26.059 --> 01:34:30.261]  Have you heard him say, put anyone that disagrees with the government's war on terror in a camp?
[01:34:31.229 --> 01:34:32.470]  Well, I call that hate radio.
[01:34:33.230 --> 01:34:37.053]  But, sir, I'm asking you because I've listened maybe ten times and heard it four times now.
[01:34:37.373 --> 01:34:38.354]  Have you heard him say that?
[01:34:38.614 --> 01:34:41.316]  Well, he says run down the peace activists with cars.
[01:34:41.516 --> 01:34:42.797]  I mean, the guy is totally out of it.
[01:34:42.817 --> 01:34:49.021]  Now, if I got on the air, and I'm not saying this, if I got on the air and said kill peace activists, I would be in jail within five hours.
[01:34:49.361 --> 01:34:51.243]  I don't know why he's able to get away with that.
[01:34:51.263 --> 01:34:52.043]  That's interesting.
[01:34:52.384 --> 01:34:52.704]  Wiener, yeah.
[01:35:09.051 --> 01:35:14.796]  A oily beatnik posing as the vanguard of ultra-conservatism and he's self-hurting.
[01:35:14.816 --> 01:35:16.417]  We've got to stop the New World Order.
[01:35:16.697 --> 01:35:18.118]  We've got to create a global government.
[01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:20.040]  Bush is fighting the New World Order.
[01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:23.963]  And line people up and shoot them if they disagree with the government.
[01:35:24.223 --> 01:35:25.604]  Put them in forced labor camps.
[01:35:25.624 --> 01:35:28.867]  The word is forced labor camps!
[01:35:29.407 --> 01:35:33.030]  Well, Guantanamo Bay is a scary premise all the way around.
[01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:35.352]  Sir Ashcroft is saying it for misdemeanors.
[01:35:36.511 --> 01:35:37.191]  It is scary.
[01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:37.892]  It is scary.
[01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:40.693]  He was before the house today saying, execute you.
[01:35:41.333 --> 01:35:44.075]  Citizen, secretly grab you, take you, and hang you.
[01:35:45.155 --> 01:35:46.416]  That's not the America I know.
[01:35:46.796 --> 01:35:48.537]  Oh, that's freedom brother, but listen.
[01:35:49.713 --> 01:35:54.777]  Listen, there are thousands of people doing this, and we're fighting, and we've got to stand up for humanity.
[01:35:54.817 --> 01:36:00.661]  We wouldn't have the freedom we have now if people didn't put it all on the line and stand up against these people.
[01:36:00.721 --> 01:36:02.182]  And folks, you go ahead and serve them.
[01:36:02.442 --> 01:36:03.643]  You watch what happens to you.
[01:36:04.063 --> 01:36:05.044]  I tell people the truth.
[01:36:05.064 --> 01:36:06.405]  You've got to get past your fear.
[01:36:06.765 --> 01:36:08.546]  You've got to ask God to protect you.
[01:36:08.586 --> 01:36:10.127]  You've got to be involved in this fight.
[01:36:10.407 --> 01:36:10.988]  You've got to go 110%.
[01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.850]  Very good, Alex.
[01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:16.612]  Why do you think they're going after Father Stewart?
[01:36:18.246 --> 01:36:21.308]  And the Catholic Church, seems like those are the two biggest targets right now.
[01:36:21.368 --> 01:36:22.289]  That's totally simple.
[01:36:22.329 --> 01:36:27.032]  You take some small company, that's small compared to these multi-trillion dollar conglomerates.
[01:36:28.193 --> 01:36:31.956]  The Fortune 500 is mainly just about a dozen companies, really eight subsidiaries.
[01:36:32.476 --> 01:36:42.863]  You go after some petty, you know, multi-hundred million dollar company, and you punish her as a sacrificial scapegoat, and make it look good to people.
[01:36:43.383 --> 01:36:44.004]  That's all you do.
[01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:47.951]  And the Catholic Church seems to be under attack.
[01:36:48.811 --> 01:36:49.951]  What's the motivation there?
[01:36:50.491 --> 01:36:57.573]  Well, you've got a lot of good people that are Catholics, but the leadership of the church... I mean, Pope John Paul just called for a, quote, New World Order yesterday, sir.
[01:36:57.593 --> 01:37:02.034]  So you've got... You don't think that's part of this conspiracy, do you?
[01:37:02.694 --> 01:37:03.074]  Pardon me?
[01:37:03.814 --> 01:37:05.795]  You don't think that's part of this conspiracy, do you?
[01:37:08.348 --> 01:37:13.751]  Some people think that Catholics run the New World Order, or they think Protestants run the New World Order, or they think Jews run the New World Order.
[01:37:14.211 --> 01:37:15.191]  It's none of those groups.
[01:37:15.351 --> 01:37:18.873]  It's key corrupt people that have infested every major organization.
[01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:20.873]  It's compartmentalization.
[01:37:20.913 --> 01:37:26.936]  But, sir, I have posted a link to the Vatican website in English where he called for a one-world government, okay?
[01:37:26.956 --> 01:37:31.598]  Remember four years ago when he called for a one-world religion and said that Muslims can go to heaven?
[01:37:31.618 --> 01:37:32.118]  Do you remember that?
[01:37:33.106 --> 01:37:34.827]  Well, he was against the war in Iraq.
[01:37:35.187 --> 01:37:35.907]  I understand that.
[01:37:36.087 --> 01:37:36.848]  I understand that.
[01:37:36.868 --> 01:37:38.408]  That's part of the European Union line.
[01:37:39.309 --> 01:37:48.833]  I'm just telling you, sir, is it infallible to have the Pope say that we need a new world order?
[01:37:50.933 --> 01:37:54.955]  Well, do you think he means it in the same context as our political leaders, though?
[01:37:55.155 --> 01:37:56.136]  Yes, that's what he said.
[01:37:56.176 --> 01:37:59.397]  He went on to say a religious, governmental, one-world government.
[01:38:00.343 --> 01:38:04.264]  Hey, it's the Catholic, it's the official Vatican News Service.
[01:38:06.904 --> 01:38:09.405]  We posted it two days ago on InfoWars.com.
[01:38:09.445 --> 01:38:13.806]  He sent it on Monday, we had it posted by Tuesday, to be accurate, it wasn't yesterday.
[01:38:14.106 --> 01:38:23.788]  Can't we get into a situation though, like I was listening to Mark Davis and he was calling Arabs bastards, he called one billion Arab bastards and they should be killed.
[01:38:24.495 --> 01:38:26.035]  On national radio this Sunday.
[01:38:26.095 --> 01:38:28.256]  I mean, that's not going to be a policy for America.
[01:38:28.296 --> 01:38:29.656]  The hatred of one whole group.
[01:38:30.076 --> 01:38:31.376]  Well, see, they're using that.
[01:38:31.716 --> 01:38:33.617]  There's certain racism that's allowed.
[01:38:33.637 --> 01:38:35.997]  They'll call them all these horrible names.
[01:38:36.637 --> 01:38:38.098]  Towelheads, ragheads.
[01:38:39.778 --> 01:38:49.040]  And they use that knowing that a lot of Americans, whether they're black or white or Hispanic, have now gotten into this tribalism of hating all Arabs or Muslims, even if they're Christian.
[01:38:50.064 --> 01:38:57.429]  And then they think, oh, all this tyranny is just for them, but the FBI training manuals focus on Christians, gun owners, homeschoolers.
[01:38:57.449 --> 01:39:00.131]  So it's about making you think it's just about this group.
[01:39:00.151 --> 01:39:04.134]  It's like the headline, the Justice Department's in trouble for violating the rights of illegals.
[01:39:04.194 --> 01:39:06.936]  People go, well, you know, so what about them?
[01:39:06.996 --> 01:39:09.058]  But the real violation is against citizens.
[01:39:09.098 --> 01:39:10.098]  So it's about theater.
[01:39:10.359 --> 01:39:14.001]  It's about making you think that they're just going after these other groups.
[01:39:14.221 --> 01:39:15.162]  But yes, it's horrible.
[01:39:16.164 --> 01:39:18.246]  One last thing, I'll take the answer off the air.
[01:39:18.326 --> 01:39:22.248]  I want you to comment on Colin Powell and his son, who's the head of the FCC.
[01:39:22.288 --> 01:39:23.069]  What do you think of them?
[01:39:23.389 --> 01:39:24.350]  Well, thank you for the call.
[01:39:25.210 --> 01:39:25.490]  Thank you.
[01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:28.092]  It's just all corrupt good old boy networks.
[01:39:28.112 --> 01:39:35.677]  170 secret meetings with the heads of the big five corporations that own 75% of the media and control 92% of total broadcast.
[01:39:36.438 --> 01:39:38.319]  And the other 8% they want to take over.
[01:39:38.579 --> 01:39:41.621]  And they're shutting down AXS TV, buying up all the final affiliates.
[01:39:42.462 --> 01:39:43.182]  But they're in trouble.
[01:39:43.222 --> 01:39:44.043]  The grassroots
[01:39:45.018 --> 01:39:45.979]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:39:45.999 --> 01:39:49.042]  The group's reverence for Nietzsche is very interesting.
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:11.083]  Nietzsche's most famous utterance was, God is dead.
[01:40:11.483 --> 01:40:12.884]  He promoted that his whole life.
[01:40:13.384 --> 01:40:18.469]  He was 18 years old when he went to college and he came from a long line of ministers on both sides.
[01:40:18.489 --> 01:40:35.403]  But then when you argue with this big neocon, top Christian controlling arm with congressmen and presidents and Bernie Generals as members and all the big Christian coalition members, a lot of them are members, are connected to it, when you say that's bad they go, no, Jesus says it's good.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:38.780]  Well, when he was 18 years old, he went insane.
[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:41.361]  Stayed insane off and on for the rest of his life.
[01:40:41.401 --> 01:40:43.681]  He was supposed to have had a brilliant mind.
[01:40:44.082 --> 01:40:45.802]  He later contracted syphilis.
[01:40:46.142 --> 01:40:50.603]  He went completely crazy, insane, and turned Italy.
[01:40:50.623 --> 01:40:55.424]  His poor mother had to come over to turn Italy and lead him home.
[01:40:55.624 --> 01:40:57.844]  Now, what you had was a demon-riding philosophy.
[01:40:58.144 --> 01:41:01.685]  He would spend 10 hours on the toilet saying that that was the holy place.
[01:41:02.351 --> 01:41:03.757]  Oh, he was absolutely mad.
[01:41:03.838 --> 01:41:07.072]  About a caller yesterday, glorifying old Henry Wallace.
[01:41:07.512 --> 01:41:09.093]  Wallace's name was not Wallace.
[01:41:09.133 --> 01:41:10.413]  His name was Walensky.
[01:41:10.713 --> 01:41:12.314]  He had a Russian background.
[01:41:12.374 --> 01:41:13.715]  He spoke fluent Russian.
[01:41:14.435 --> 01:41:34.243]  When he went over to, at their invitation to inspect the gulags in Siberia, he, knowing the Russian language and the Russian personality and disposition, he came back with glowing terms about the way... The New York Times told us Uncle Joe Stalin's good, while the so-called right wing and the army were funding him and put Mao into power.
[01:41:34.503 --> 01:41:35.744]  The History Channel now admits.
[01:41:35.784 --> 01:41:36.324]  Thanks for the call.
[01:41:36.917 --> 01:41:37.698]  Really great points.
[01:41:38.118 --> 01:41:39.039]  Roy in Michigan.
[01:41:39.099 --> 01:41:39.940]  Roy, you're on the air.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:40.460]  Go ahead.
[01:41:42.022 --> 01:41:42.342]  Hello?
[01:41:42.642 --> 01:41:43.163]  Hello, sir.
[01:41:43.543 --> 01:41:43.783]  Yes.
[01:41:44.844 --> 01:41:55.473]  It makes it clearer and clearer as time goes on here that the war is really with the powers and principalities, as talked about in the scripture, and that's the church and the state.
[01:41:56.734 --> 01:42:04.081]  And if it was not for the religious people, those religious Republicans and Democrats, and you, David,
[01:42:05.799 --> 01:42:23.287]  This thing would never be happening, but I can hear clearly at your station when I'm listening to you that you're starting to see it, or you have been seeing it, that the church and the state are the ones who are bringing this thing about.
[01:42:26.124 --> 01:42:46.215]  Well, when you find out there's a giant organization controlled by the CIA saying that they love Nietzsche, they love Hitler, they call for world dictatorships so the leader can appear, and a lot of the so-called Christian Coalition and rights groups you hear on Christian radio are members, you know what you're dealing with.
[01:42:46.235 --> 01:42:47.996]  I mean, that's all that happened.
[01:42:48.016 --> 01:42:48.696]  The Satanists?
[01:42:49.197 --> 01:42:51.418]  That's what's going on with Bohemian Rhapsody, Mainstream News.
[01:42:51.878 --> 01:42:53.599]  They just figured out how to take over the churches?
[01:42:53.619 --> 01:42:55.380]  Now they're going to have federal funding of it?
[01:42:56.321 --> 01:43:00.202]  And, uh, the, uh, I mean, this is the system.
[01:43:00.242 --> 01:43:01.643]  It's like that movie with Robert Duvall.
[01:43:01.663 --> 01:43:02.163]  What's it called?
[01:43:02.183 --> 01:43:02.963]  The Handmaiden?
[01:43:04.483 --> 01:43:14.526]  I didn't see the movie, but, uh... It's just where they run around executing you and do all these corrupt things, and they all sing I's their symbol on the news, and they say, Jesus says die!
[01:43:15.267 --> 01:43:17.307]  And, uh, and they're really Satanist.
[01:43:17.988 --> 01:43:20.928]  I don't want to outwit the... I've circulated a lot of your tapes.
[01:43:20.948 --> 01:43:22.789]  As a matter of fact, I wanted to ask you about this.
[01:43:23.467 --> 01:43:23.828]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:38.445 --> 01:43:40.586]  It's highbrow, it's university level.
[01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:06.646]  It is the most complete overview of total enslavement.
[01:44:06.666 --> 01:44:08.172]  That's why it's called total enslavement.
[01:44:08.937 --> 01:44:10.659]  And, uh, it's two hours and thirty-seven minutes.
[01:44:10.819 --> 01:44:14.922]  I suggest you have people watch it in fifteen minute blocks, or what, fifty-two minute and a half blocks.
[01:44:15.002 --> 01:44:17.204]  It's two hours and thirty-seven minutes long.
[01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:22.888]  So you're actually appealing to more of the intellectual crowd than, uh... Well, it's just so horrible.
[01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:30.594]  It's so insane and so evil, what they're doing, and them saying it, and just so hardcore.
[01:44:30.615 --> 01:44:36.059]  Uh, just their incredible crimes, all the terror they carry out, what their plans are for you and your family.
[01:44:36.099 --> 01:44:37.280]  It is a nightmare film.
[01:44:40.467 --> 01:44:41.448]  Does that answer your question?
[01:44:41.968 --> 01:44:42.728]  Uh, yes it does.
[01:44:42.968 --> 01:44:44.989]  Okay.
[01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:54.955]  Until people stop worshipping the flags and crosses and the crystal, I think we're going to continue to have this problem of waking them up.
[01:44:54.995 --> 01:44:56.115]  That's what's going on.
[01:44:56.255 --> 01:44:57.696]  It's called idolatry.
[01:44:58.136 --> 01:44:58.636]  You got it.
[01:44:58.957 --> 01:45:00.818]  It's form over reality.
[01:45:05.672 --> 01:45:10.156]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:45:10.516 --> 01:45:14.599]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:15.440]  We listened.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:20.745]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:45:21.005 --> 01:45:21.505]  We listened.
[01:45:21.886 --> 01:45:24.928]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:45:25.348 --> 01:45:25.869]  We listened.
[01:45:26.329 --> 01:45:30.390]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:31.270]  We listened.
[01:45:31.610 --> 01:45:36.852]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:45:37.252 --> 01:45:38.612]  Again, we listened.
[01:45:38.972 --> 01:45:46.354]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:45:46.735 --> 01:45:50.195]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling

[01:46:00.729 --> 01:46:02.149]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:46:04.890 --> 01:46:12.272]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:17.274]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:46:17.494 --> 01:46:23.136]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:27.920]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:46:28.121 --> 01:46:35.288]  The tax was society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:46:35.308 --> 01:46:36.088]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:46:36.128 --> 01:46:38.831]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network.
[01:46:38.891 --> 01:46:39.832]  And much, much more.
[01:46:39.992 --> 01:46:42.513]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Care.
[01:46:42.734 --> 01:46:49.498]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:46:49.698 --> 01:46:54.962]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:46:54.982 --> 01:46:55.362]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:47:04.449 --> 01:47:07.551]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:11.293]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio is the answer.
[01:47:11.813 --> 01:47:16.356]  Featuring continuous tuning for all shortwave frequencies, utilizing direct keypad tuning.
[01:47:16.876 --> 01:47:20.238]  Dual conversion improves shortwave image for better shortwave reception.
[01:47:20.739 --> 01:47:24.321]  Single sideband allows for reception of upper and lower sideband signals.
[01:47:24.581 --> 01:47:29.684]  Other features include 45 station memory, auto preset system, auto memory scale,
[01:47:29.684 --> 01:47:30.484]  We're good to go!
[01:48:04.346 --> 01:48:06.372]  Monday, Monday through Friday.
[01:48:12.174 --> 01:48:15.075]  From 11 to 2 Central, and then back from 9 to midnight.
[01:48:15.575 --> 01:48:16.716]  I'm here, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:48:16.736 --> 01:48:19.257]  We go out on the AM and FM dial, growing list of great affiliates.
[01:48:19.277 --> 01:48:23.038]  We simulcast at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:48:23.738 --> 01:48:32.162]  And of course, the global shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20, and at night at 5.085 and 68.90 from 9 to midnight.
[01:48:32.722 --> 01:48:41.065]  Hot to go back to Rick and Dan and Bill and others that are patiently holding, and we'll get into a ton of other news and information in the next hour.
[01:48:42.944 --> 01:48:50.791]  But when you totally lose all track of history and what real political movements do and let corrupt elites get control, you're in for quite a ride.
[01:48:50.811 --> 01:48:54.514]  But if you stand up boldly with courage, you protect the society, your family.
[01:48:55.555 --> 01:48:56.696]  It's simple, folks.
[01:48:57.697 --> 01:48:58.838]  Stand up, you're Americans.
[01:48:58.898 --> 01:48:59.819]  Why are you so afraid?
[01:48:59.839 --> 01:49:01.060]  Because you know tyranny's here.
[01:49:01.841 --> 01:49:04.503]  So go ahead and admit the tyranny, stand up and fight it, and have courage.
[01:49:05.004 --> 01:49:07.226]  Before I go back to Rick and Dan and Bill and others,
[01:49:08.126 --> 01:49:09.707]  You've heard me talk a lot about my videos.
[01:49:09.767 --> 01:49:12.549]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement is now out.
[01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:14.130]  So is 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:49:14.770 --> 01:49:16.751]  The Masters of Terror is part two of that video.
[01:49:16.771 --> 01:49:17.812]  They're all incredible.
[01:49:18.312 --> 01:49:19.973]  My book is Assent to Tyranny.
[01:49:19.993 --> 01:49:20.794]  230 pages is only $12.
[01:49:20.934 --> 01:49:27.358]  I have pro-gun, anti-tyranny t-shirts that say politicians love disarmed peasants on the back, on the front.
[01:49:27.698 --> 01:49:28.819]  Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
[01:49:29.579 --> 01:49:32.061]  Politicians, uh, mass murderers agree.
[01:49:32.661 --> 01:49:33.662]  Gun control works.
[01:49:35.692 --> 01:49:43.617]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and order the videos, the books, the t-shirts today.

[01:49:45.859 --> 01:49:49.581]  Make a copy every morning on your dual VCR, on a second VCR when you go to work.
[01:49:49.942 --> 01:49:51.603]  Make a copy when you go to sleep at night.
[01:49:51.963 --> 01:49:53.664]  Give out 14 copies a week.
[01:49:53.784 --> 01:49:55.165]  Do it for about 3 or 4 months.

[01:49:56.786 --> 01:49:58.067]  Only cost you a couple hundred bucks.
[01:49:58.707 --> 01:49:59.828]  Save this country.
[01:50:00.168 --> 01:50:00.849]  Grassroots.
[01:50:00.869 --> 01:50:04.271]  Because once you show somebody the truth, you've neutralized the lie forever.
[01:50:04.955 --> 01:50:07.097]  Let's come out with the whole truth, nothing but the truth.
[01:50:07.557 --> 01:50:11.480]  One of the globalist tactics, though, is the truth is so bizarre some people can't interface with it.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:14.882]  At first, but later they wake up after you plant the seeds.
[01:50:15.383 --> 01:50:18.765]  So go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get the videos.

[01:50:44.164 --> 01:50:49.088]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Rick in New York.
[01:50:49.148 --> 01:50:49.789]  Rick, you're on the air.
[01:50:49.829 --> 01:50:50.229]  Go ahead.
[01:50:50.669 --> 01:50:51.250]  How you doing, Al?
[01:50:51.710 --> 01:50:52.391]  Pretty good, sir.
[01:50:52.451 --> 01:50:53.772]  Some hardcore news today.
[01:50:53.892 --> 01:50:57.655]  Ashcroft saying he wants to secretly arrest citizens and execute them at camps.
[01:50:58.453 --> 01:51:00.760]  Yeah, I want to read a short paragraph from the New American.
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:04.732]  The article is called Trading Freedom for Security.
[01:51:05.379 --> 01:51:09.242]  And it says that, uh, unfortunately, Representative Paul could not stop the stampede.
[01:51:09.702 --> 01:51:13.765]  However, Congress didn't include sunset provisions in the legislation.
[01:51:14.205 --> 01:51:18.749]  These provisions make some of the key powers expire at the end of 2005 unless Congress reauthorizes them.
[01:51:18.769 --> 01:51:19.609]  That's not true.
[01:51:19.709 --> 01:51:20.470]  That's not true.
[01:51:20.490 --> 01:51:26.534]  Section, what is it, 203, the sunset provision has no sunset on the key police state provisions of the first Patriot Act.
[01:51:26.995 --> 01:51:27.455]  Oh, really?
[01:51:27.595 --> 01:51:32.419]  That wasn't true to begin with, but now they're getting rid of all sunset provisions in the new Patriot Act.
[01:51:33.159 --> 01:51:33.779]  That's horrible.
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:34.300]  Yeah.
[01:51:35.552 --> 01:51:36.773]  Okay, go ahead, keep reading.
[01:51:37.273 --> 01:51:37.814]  Okay, sure.
[01:51:38.134 --> 01:51:39.395]  What the hell?
[01:51:39.815 --> 01:51:40.956]  I'm glad you straightened me out, though.
[01:51:41.376 --> 01:51:47.480]  The administration and congressional Republicans are now trying to make the temporary powers permanent by removing the sunset clauses, whatever.
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:55.306]  The New York Times reported on April 8th that Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican in Utah, is leading the effort to lock in the new FedGov police powers.
[01:51:55.666 --> 01:51:57.387]  But it's not just locking in the old ones.
[01:51:57.947 --> 01:52:02.669]  They're usurping and claiming the power to secretly arrest citizens for not even committing a crime.
[01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:03.890]  It actually says that.
[01:52:04.290 --> 01:52:05.691]  In the courts are ruling they can do it.
[01:52:05.731 --> 01:52:10.713]  They're already implementing Patriot Act 2 before Ashcroft today announced he wants Patriot Act 2 passed.
[01:52:11.334 --> 01:52:13.134]  Yeah.
[01:52:13.175 --> 01:52:16.956]  Recently I just picked up your last film, the Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:52:16.976 --> 01:52:18.837]  I must say it's quite a piece, Alex.
[01:52:19.578 --> 01:52:20.318]  I really enjoyed it.
[01:52:21.929 --> 01:52:25.571]  Well, I get sick watching it, but it is important medicine.
[01:52:26.391 --> 01:52:26.651]  Yeah.
[01:52:27.612 --> 01:52:29.212]  It's just so much information, you know.
[01:52:29.272 --> 01:52:36.056]  It's like you said, watch it in 50 minute increments or whatever and watch it three times or something to get the full gist of it, you know.
[01:52:36.136 --> 01:52:37.156]  I think that's a good idea.
[01:52:37.516 --> 01:52:38.777]  Have you seen The Road to Tyranny?
[01:52:39.137 --> 01:52:41.898]  Sure, I saw it on your website before you took it down.
[01:52:42.338 --> 01:52:43.999]  That's the film to get to get out to people.
[01:52:44.399 --> 01:52:45.260]  Appreciate the call.
[01:52:46.294 --> 01:52:48.114]  We'll come back and talk to Dan Bell and others.
[01:52:48.294 --> 01:52:49.375]  3rd Hour News Blitz.
[01:52:49.395 --> 01:52:49.895]  Your calls.

[01:52:56.436 --> 01:52:58.936]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world.
[01:52:59.176 --> 01:53:00.077]  The Aeronizer.
[01:53:00.217 --> 01:53:02.137]  Air purifier is not a filter.
[01:53:02.337 --> 01:53:04.617]  And there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:53:04.798 --> 01:53:05.818]  The Aeronizer.
[01:53:09.418 --> 01:53:12.559]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:20.218 --> 01:53:20.858]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.539 --> 01:53:22.580]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:24.421]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:25.062 --> 01:53:25.883]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.643 --> 01:53:27.524]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.544 --> 01:53:31.968]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.388 --> 01:53:36.452]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.635 --> 01:53:38.396]  All right, my friends.
[01:53:38.437 --> 01:53:39.678]  Thanks for joining us today.
[01:53:39.698 --> 01:53:43.424]  Already into the third hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:53:43.464 --> 01:53:45.387]  Tons of your calls coming out of the bunch of news.
[01:53:45.407 --> 01:53:46.068]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:46.148 --> 01:53:47.670]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:53:53.939 --> 01:53:56.181]  A couple weeks ago, a week and a half ago, I talked about U.S.
[01:53:56.201 --> 01:53:59.764]  plans death camp out of Reuters and the Mail on Sunday and other publications.
[01:54:00.344 --> 01:54:03.747]  Ashcroft this morning went before the Congress.
[01:54:04.568 --> 01:54:06.769]  Ashcroft wants broader anti-terror powers.
[01:54:06.829 --> 01:54:16.897]  Attorney General John Ashcroft asked Congress Thursday to expand powers, hold suspected terrorists indefinitely before trials and let them, let him seek the death penalty or life imprisonment for any terrorist act.
[01:54:17.798 --> 01:54:23.523]  And under the new definition of terrorism, it's any action that endangers human life that's a violation of any federal or state law.
[01:54:24.406 --> 01:54:26.747]  That's Patriot Act 1 under the expanded definition.
[01:54:26.807 --> 01:54:29.629]  It says you don't even have to knowingly aid terrorists or even do anything wrong.
[01:54:30.069 --> 01:54:32.671]  They want to secretly arrest you and secretly execute you.
[01:54:33.672 --> 01:54:38.054]  Better call Congress and tell them you're fully aware of the dictatorship they're setting up.
[01:54:38.074 --> 01:54:40.516]  And they say, oh, we've got to do this to keep you safe from terror.
[01:54:41.056 --> 01:54:44.058]  Telling me they're getting ready for more, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:44.638 --> 01:54:49.041]  We don't know how hard the hammer is going to drop, but if we get the word out of who's behind the terror, we could back them off.
[01:54:51.244 --> 01:54:56.266]  But it is life or death to warn people right now, ladies and gentlemen, and to have courage and to tell the truth.
[01:54:56.286 --> 01:54:58.627]  To get the word out at the grassroots and not go along with them.
[01:54:59.827 --> 01:55:08.191]  Some of the good news is they tried to tell all the medical workers and police and firemen, 11 million of them, they had to take smallpox shots and only a few hundred went along with it.
[01:55:08.591 --> 01:55:12.232]  And so now they're going to have trouble launching smallpox attacks and force injecting all of us.
[01:55:12.692 --> 01:55:14.313]  As they said they wanted to do.
[01:55:15.174 --> 01:55:16.936]  Because people just aren't going along with it.
[01:55:17.436 --> 01:55:20.179]  The media can say we all buy it and love tyranny all day.
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:22.021]  The people aren't buying it.
[01:55:22.061 --> 01:55:26.446]  A few mindless pieces of furniture are going to go along with it and parrot whatever they hear.
[01:55:26.906 --> 01:55:31.090]  But the majority of America knows there's a rotten stench coming out of Washington.
[01:55:31.511 --> 01:55:36.276]  The stench of the order of death of the skull and bones of the New World Order.
[01:55:37.654 --> 01:55:40.995]  Because of pressure, Bush has also had to arm pilots, though he said he was against it.
[01:55:41.375 --> 01:55:46.177]  Now, partial birth abortion ban passes House because of pressure, though Bush's wife is not for it.
[01:55:46.657 --> 01:55:50.559]  In China, the reality of persecution, Christians being tortured, our government funding it.
[01:55:51.839 --> 01:55:55.201]  Study links 9-1-1 Gulf War vets and birth defects.
[01:55:55.221 --> 01:55:56.641]  This is from the Associated Press.
[01:55:57.301 --> 01:55:59.282]  Russia to send nuclear fuel to Iran.
[01:55:59.822 --> 01:56:01.303]  Ban on all tobacco products.
[01:56:02.043 --> 01:56:02.283]  U.S.
[01:56:02.323 --> 01:56:04.144]  Health Chief, the
[01:56:05.723 --> 01:56:06.624]  I'm a church father Catholic.
[01:56:06.644 --> 01:56:08.284]  I'm not a Vatican II Catholic.
[01:56:08.465 --> 01:56:09.885]  And when you mention the Pope,
[01:56:36.345 --> 01:56:39.347]  The Vatican II world takeover is a little bit different than Bush's.
[01:56:41.508 --> 01:56:44.669]  This takeover is through passivity in a world without reason.
[01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:51.712]  Well, I know we've had Mel Gibson's father on several times, and that's what he says is that the Catholic Church has been taken over.
[01:56:51.732 --> 01:56:59.196]  I mean, when the Pope calls for a new world order Monday, and it's on the Catholic website, news service, and people are trying to deny it.
[01:56:59.756 --> 01:57:02.277]  No, no, you talked about the Muslim part.
[01:57:02.297 --> 01:57:04.038]  You look in the Vatican II catechism.
[01:57:04.685 --> 01:57:08.347]  It says clearly in there, the Muslims are our brother through Abraham.
[01:57:09.768 --> 01:57:11.429]  This is all documented.
[01:57:11.489 --> 01:57:14.451]  This is to take the mind away.
[01:57:15.331 --> 01:57:18.153]  He'll tell everyone to their face that St.
[01:57:19.034 --> 01:57:20.815]  Augustine was the greatest theologian that ever lived.
[01:57:21.755 --> 01:57:25.538]  Yet everything he talks about is completely 180 degrees against St.
[01:57:25.558 --> 01:57:25.798]  Augustine.
[01:57:25.898 --> 01:57:28.239]  Yeah, they'll give you the label and then do the opposite.
[01:57:28.279 --> 01:57:29.300]  But let's just explain this.
[01:57:30.302 --> 01:57:38.311]  Could somebody, let's just say that, I'm not a Catholic, let's just say that people really believe the Pope's infallible and all this, next cathedra and you know, just God's person on earth.
[01:57:39.332 --> 01:57:41.755]  Could somebody kidnap the Pope and put a look-alike in?
[01:57:41.775 --> 01:57:44.318]  You know, do we follow whatever the Pope says if you're a Catholic?
[01:57:44.638 --> 01:57:46.160]  The answer is obviously no.
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:48.322]  Jesus Christ said that, use discernment.
[01:57:50.021 --> 01:57:51.182]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:57:51.302 --> 01:57:52.022]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:52.423 --> 01:57:53.003]  Well, stay there.
[01:57:53.063 --> 01:57:54.044]  I'll let you talk about it.
[01:57:54.644 --> 01:57:56.505]  We'll get to other callers, Bill and others.

[01:58:24.137 --> 01:58:28.878]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:58:29.098 --> 01:58:34.740]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.

[02:01:33.670 --> 02:01:40.394]  Occultists are members of these neo-con, quote, brotherhood Christian nodules all over the country.
[02:01:40.414 --> 02:01:45.637]  You know, you got Franco involved in it, people in Vatican City involved in it, it's all the same deal.
[02:01:45.677 --> 02:02:00.425]  And I have, here is the address Pope John Paul II delivered Sunday, receiving the letters of credence of Odin Ben-Hur, the new Israel ambassador to the Holy See.
[02:02:01.890 --> 02:02:06.394]  And he says in here that we need a New World Order.
[02:02:07.254 --> 02:02:14.560]  And I'll read his entire quote in a second, but Dan in, what is it, Illinois, was raising a point about this.
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:15.881]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:02:16.642 --> 02:02:28.851]  You know how 200 years after the Constitution, we're in a situation right now where to criticize Bush is if, in other words, they're making him infallible is what they're trying to rewrite things in such a way, right?
[02:02:29.491 --> 02:02:31.933]  Basically, he's infallible because you can't criticize him.
[02:02:32.573 --> 02:02:32.914]  Yes.
[02:02:33.114 --> 02:02:33.994]  It's the same thing.
[02:02:34.014 --> 02:02:37.597]  There's no such thing in Catholic doctrine history of infallibility.
[02:02:37.957 --> 02:02:39.819]  They've had corrupt popes since the beginning.
[02:02:39.839 --> 02:02:45.683]  I mean, Peter was corrected by Paul, so he couldn't have been infallible, and he was the first leader.
[02:02:46.243 --> 02:02:54.849]  So this is just a myth, so that whatever's coming out of their mouth, it has to be believed it's from God, because you're questioning God.
[02:02:55.330 --> 02:02:56.911]  It's the same fallacy.
[02:02:57.554 --> 02:03:00.056]  There's no such thing as infallibility of any human being.
[02:03:02.477 --> 02:03:09.422]  Well, look, that's, you know, just going over this, where you've got Pope John Paul II calling for a New World Order.
[02:03:10.423 --> 02:03:11.664]  We've got to talk about this.
[02:03:11.744 --> 02:03:12.865]  We've got to face this.
[02:03:13.485 --> 02:03:14.346]  I'm reading his address.
[02:03:14.406 --> 02:03:15.607]  I found it on Monday.
[02:03:15.647 --> 02:03:18.809]  I'm trying to find the quote about need a New World Order.
[02:03:19.710 --> 02:03:23.232]  His design, exactly, but his design isn't with violence.
[02:03:23.292 --> 02:03:25.093]  His design is passivity.
[02:03:25.414 --> 02:03:27.135]  Well, they've got a multifaceted system.
[02:03:29.028 --> 02:03:33.031]  As long as you get the mind, you know, you just take people's word for it.
[02:03:33.071 --> 02:03:34.031]  Take people's word for it.
[02:03:34.091 --> 02:03:35.092]  Take people's word for it.
[02:03:35.332 --> 02:03:37.173]  Never investigate what Augustine said.
[02:03:37.233 --> 02:03:39.075]  Never investigate what church doctrine.
[02:03:39.495 --> 02:03:41.696]  You keep taking them, you're not going to have a mind left.
[02:03:42.057 --> 02:03:44.979]  You have to be able to analyze and cross-reference.
[02:03:45.839 --> 02:03:49.602]  Absolutely, and of course any big powerful organization is going to say we're unquestionable.
[02:03:49.642 --> 02:03:51.183]  You can't question us.
[02:03:51.223 --> 02:03:52.544]  Everything we say is from God.
[02:03:52.564 --> 02:03:54.185]  I mean, that's what cult leaders say.
[02:03:55.194 --> 02:03:56.015]  That's what happens.
[02:03:56.235 --> 02:04:02.878]  And I'm telling you, the Protestants, the Catholics, the Jews, the Muslims, they're all controlled by corrupt organizations.
[02:04:03.299 --> 02:04:04.539]  It's the nature of power.
[02:04:04.619 --> 02:04:08.281]  Can we just recognize that historical fact?
[02:04:08.562 --> 02:04:23.370]  But the most, if you'll notice, the most effective cults in the world, and I'm talking about the small ones now, this is large scale, but the small ones, the most effective ones, these people are passive and they don't have a violent, you know, without being pressed anyway, but I mean violence is like kind of
[02:04:23.797 --> 02:04:24.538]  We're good to go.
[02:04:53.956 --> 02:04:56.982]  Does that follow along what you've researched too?
[02:04:57.363 --> 02:04:59.246]  I really don't listen to the show.
[02:05:00.489 --> 02:05:01.450]  I don't know much about it.
[02:05:01.471 --> 02:05:03.454]  She's a talk show host, right?
[02:05:03.474 --> 02:05:04.857]  I think I've been on her show a couple times.
[02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:05.659]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:12.192]  I've done thousands of interviews, 850-something since 9-1-1, I can't remember.
[02:05:12.712 --> 02:05:13.033]  Oh, okay.
[02:05:13.273 --> 02:05:16.734]  Well, they have this thing about how Walmart's all involved with Red China.
[02:05:17.194 --> 02:05:18.575]  Well, that's been in the mainstream news.
[02:05:18.615 --> 02:05:25.438]  They own over 700 slave camps, they admit they're putting RFID tracker systems to track you outside the store, and that's USA Today.
[02:05:25.978 --> 02:05:28.139]  Yeah, yeah, that's what they got going on.
[02:05:28.479 --> 02:05:31.060]  But I was wondering if anybody's heard about Target yet?
[02:05:31.624 --> 02:05:33.866]  Well, they're all putting in the RFID tracker systems.
[02:05:33.886 --> 02:05:35.787]  They're all buying slave goods.
[02:05:36.448 --> 02:05:39.490]  Walmart's the most successful because they own the camps themselves.
[02:05:40.011 --> 02:05:44.895]  Yeah, they got barbed wire around their, what do you call it, the garden center?
[02:05:45.675 --> 02:05:46.416]  Have you heard about that?
[02:05:47.341 --> 02:05:54.243]  Well I know that there has been some special forces training in and around Walmart distribution centers and they're part of Continuity of Government.
[02:05:54.583 --> 02:06:10.147]  The AP has reported they've done drills where they practice having everyone report in the town to the Walmart with a fence around it and some of these test zones, the police substation where they quote give you your inoculations and practice giving you pills that are jelly beans as a drill.
[02:06:10.247 --> 02:06:11.368]  So that's confirmed.
[02:06:11.428 --> 02:06:13.648]  I only talk about what I can confirm.
[02:06:13.828 --> 02:06:16.509]  Well yeah but I mean I saw this one thing where this guy said they
[02:06:16.789 --> 02:06:19.170]  I think everybody has to look at how the WWE is involved.
[02:06:19.210 --> 02:06:20.190]  And tell us what the WWE is?
[02:06:20.230 --> 02:06:22.011]  The World Wrestling Entertainment.
[02:06:45.419 --> 02:06:48.540]  Oh, where they have the New World Order group that's unstoppable, and yeah.
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:55.223]  Yeah, that was what the WCW had, and now the WWE, they got a guy, he's got his head shaved, Stone Cold Steve Austin.
[02:06:56.623 --> 02:07:01.925]  And he's got his head shaved, and he's been on there for years now, and then his finishing move is a stunner.
[02:07:02.365 --> 02:07:10.028]  And what he does is he kicks someone in the stomach, and then he puts their head over his arm, see, and then he comes down, and it's like a guillotine.
[02:07:11.028 --> 02:07:15.050]  Well, the New World Order group got up in support of Bush and said,
[02:07:16.198 --> 02:07:19.700]  All of you people that are against this war, you need to die!
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:20.721]  We're going to get you!
[02:07:20.741 --> 02:07:22.282]  And to the kids, Raaah!
[02:07:22.382 --> 02:07:23.422]  It's just at every level.
[02:07:23.462 --> 02:07:25.163]  It's gladiatorial, mindless theater.
[02:07:25.524 --> 02:07:26.224]  Thanks for the call.
[02:07:26.244 --> 02:07:30.807]  Really appreciate the call.
[02:07:32.783 --> 02:07:35.425]  So, look, I challenge you to go to Infowars.com.
[02:07:35.485 --> 02:07:37.726]  This was posted on Tuesday.
[02:07:37.746 --> 02:07:47.111]  You can read Pope John Paul's quote here saying that we need to come together with a new world order with all the nations of the world under a new world order is his quote.
[02:07:48.712 --> 02:07:52.114]  So, that's what we're dealing with there.
[02:07:52.154 --> 02:07:58.337]  Let me get into some news before we get too far along on this last hour and then I will get to your calls.
[02:08:00.245 --> 02:08:28.392]  But I do suggest everyone go to Infowars.com and read the Harper's Magazine article about the brotherhood with the CIA and Ashcroft and all these conservative, Catholic, Protestant Christian leaders and they said that Nietzsche was good, Hitler was good, Stalin was good, Mao was good, Jesus is a spirit guy, they're going to take over, Jesus needs a world dictatorship and a world leader to really love us properly and purges are good,
[02:08:29.895 --> 02:08:31.056]  Purges are very good.
[02:08:31.076 --> 02:08:34.097]  There's just been a handful of articles, L.A.
[02:08:34.137 --> 02:08:37.379]  Times and others about this, and this is your neo-con-Christians.
[02:08:39.119 --> 02:08:41.441]  See, folks, it's a counterfeit.
[02:08:41.641 --> 02:08:47.123]  I mean, it's not even a good counterfeit, it's just a blatant, but all they say, when you go, but you say Hitler's good, they go, but Jesus.
[02:08:47.904 --> 02:08:48.884]  But Jesus.
[02:08:49.004 --> 02:08:50.445]  They just keep saying, but we're with Jesus.
[02:08:50.785 --> 02:08:51.726]  Who are you with?
[02:08:53.026 --> 02:08:54.487]  We're Christian conservatives.
[02:08:55.675 --> 02:08:57.397]  And then Al Gore is involved in it.
[02:08:57.457 --> 02:08:59.318]  See, it's all the same ballgame.
[02:08:59.338 --> 02:09:05.764]  It's totally staged out of that whole election fight they're putting in the touch screen, federal takeover system.
[02:09:07.445 --> 02:09:12.890]  The same system over and over and over and over again.
[02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:14.251]  And I beg you to think for yourself.
[02:09:14.291 --> 02:09:19.315]  I mean, right now they're going after Martha Stewart because she's small potatoes to make you think they're going after corporate corruption.
[02:09:19.355 --> 02:09:20.196]  Forget about Enron.
[02:09:21.593 --> 02:09:29.060]  Right now they're firing a few New York Times reporters over lies on petty issues just to make you think, oh the media is cleaning itself up.
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:33.483]  This comes as the polls show that only 32% of Americans trust the mainstream media.
[02:09:35.125 --> 02:09:37.127]  And 80 plus percent trust the alternative media.
[02:09:38.027 --> 02:09:39.108]  They're desperate folks.
[02:09:39.329 --> 02:09:40.089]  These are tactics.
[02:09:41.437 --> 02:09:43.658]  Partial birth abortion ban passes the House.
[02:09:44.098 --> 02:09:52.501]  The House voted Wednesday to ban a procedure that abortion folks call Partial Birth Abortion Moving Restriction, a crucial step closer to President Bush's signature.
[02:09:53.301 --> 02:09:57.263]  And Bush told Senator Lott to drop this.
[02:09:57.343 --> 02:09:59.344]  It was one of the reasons they allowed the demonization of him.
[02:10:00.424 --> 02:10:04.446]  Plan members like Byrd run around in front of everyone, but that's okay.
[02:10:05.126 --> 02:10:07.687]  Just like these members of the Brotherhood can say Hitler was good.
[02:10:08.604 --> 02:10:14.370]  But nobody criticizes them, but then Locke says something about at a going-away party, you'd be a great president, and they run him out.
[02:10:15.931 --> 02:10:23.339]  So Bush has fought against this, but because of massive support and even Dick Gephardt voting for the ban, these babies can be adopted at the time they're killed, folks.
[02:10:25.881 --> 02:10:30.346]  The law says as long as they hold the baby up against the mother, they can still say it wasn't born and kill it.
[02:10:31.701 --> 02:10:39.047]  A 282 to 139 vote, Congress is on the verge of ending a practice Representative Steve Cabot said was truly a national tragedy.
[02:10:39.087 --> 02:10:42.270]  Abortion rights groups said they would challenge it in court.
[02:10:42.290 --> 02:10:43.551]  You mean murder right groups?
[02:10:44.192 --> 02:10:50.457]  Challenge it in court as soon as it becomes law, thrusting the issue of the ban's constitutionality toward a divided Supreme Court.
[02:10:51.278 --> 02:10:59.165]  The ban would be one of the most significant restrictions on abortion since 73 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision reorganizing and recognizing abortion rights.
[02:11:00.774 --> 02:11:04.597]  Bush hailed past his legislation, which he called, will help build a culture of life in America.
[02:11:04.617 --> 02:11:10.241]  I urge Congress to quickly resolve the differences and send me a final bill as soon as possible so that I can sign the law.
[02:11:10.722 --> 02:11:19.769]  By the way, Bush cut like 80 million of forced abortion funding to the world and then increased their funding four and a half billion through another pipeline.
[02:11:21.110 --> 02:11:24.713]  So, and again, Henry Kissinger's document from 74 just came out.
[02:11:26.014 --> 02:11:28.736]  Public on InfoWars.com, the eugenics section.
[02:11:30.371 --> 02:11:36.832]  Where they say that they wanted to exterminate half the women, sterilize half the women and babies in 13 most populous countries.
[02:11:36.852 --> 02:11:39.453]  They successfully carried that out.
[02:11:39.933 --> 02:11:42.273]  CIA document with Henry Kissinger all over it.
[02:11:42.453 --> 02:11:44.493]  His name and his quotes all over it.
[02:11:45.754 --> 02:11:57.236]  So they'll slaughter the world and then tell you they're against partial birth abortion because you pushed, as good grassroots Americans, good job for forcing the goblins' hands.
[02:11:57.716 --> 02:11:58.936]  You've got to give them a few victories.
[02:12:00.614 --> 02:12:01.795]  That's their whole attitude.
[02:12:02.035 --> 02:12:03.297]  Got to give the public a few victories.
[02:12:03.337 --> 02:12:05.640]  Got to give them a few victories to sell you this.
[02:12:06.341 --> 02:12:08.303]  It's like they got to give us a few victories.
[02:12:08.343 --> 02:12:13.210]  They said we got to give them some victories on Martha Stewart or victories on firing a few New York Times people.
[02:12:14.932 --> 02:12:18.597]  When the massive institutionalized lying is everywhere.
[02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:25.694]  And I guess the conservatives will say, well, he banned partial birth abortion, but see, there's all these waivers in it.
[02:12:25.854 --> 02:12:26.635]  Life of the mother.
[02:12:26.675 --> 02:12:33.761]  Well, any doctor can sign a form saying, well, this could threaten a life, so there's holes in this you can drive a Mack truck through.
[02:12:34.521 --> 02:12:37.063]  We need to abolish Roe v. Wade.
[02:12:38.505 --> 02:12:41.107]  I repent for not doing enough to stop this.
[02:12:41.147 --> 02:12:48.813]  If we can kill 52 million children since 74, in this country, and not do more, it's disgusting.
[02:12:49.719 --> 02:12:53.740]  By the way, pro-life demonstration is listed as terrorism by the U.S.
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:55.861]  Code and racketeering according to the U.S.A.
[02:12:55.901 --> 02:12:56.961]  Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[02:12:58.181 --> 02:13:00.282]  So that'll be considered terrorism and hate speech.
[02:13:00.342 --> 02:13:02.562]  Just thought you might want to know you could end up in a death camp.
[02:13:04.123 --> 02:13:08.164]  Well, saying abortion's wrong means I'll end up in a death camp.
[02:13:09.004 --> 02:13:10.204]  I'm actually at peace about it.
[02:13:11.384 --> 02:13:13.765]  I just think the torture's gonna be tough to go through, but I'm ready.
[02:13:17.330 --> 02:13:21.831]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:13:22.171 --> 02:13:26.253]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:13:26.553 --> 02:13:27.093]  We listened.
[02:13:27.413 --> 02:13:32.374]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:13:32.674 --> 02:13:33.155]  We listened.
[02:13:33.535 --> 02:13:36.576]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:13:36.996 --> 02:13:37.536]  We listened.
[02:13:37.996 --> 02:13:41.157]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:13:41.397 --> 02:13:41.957]  We're good to go.
[02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:08.874]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:14:08.894 --> 02:14:10.539]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:14:15.746 --> 02:14:18.827]  Remember what it was like to get up in the morning without pain and stiffness in your joints?

[02:17:00.104 --> 02:17:01.865]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:17:02.105 --> 02:17:03.945]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:24.665 --> 02:17:49.208]  I was giving a speech before about 300 people, conservatives, liberals, libertarians, environmentalists, it didn't matter, city council members, former city council members, about standing up against the Patriot Act here in Austin, Texas a few months ago, and in the speech I said, the New World Order is the greatest evil ever seen, they're totally wicked,
[02:17:50.749 --> 02:17:52.670]  How could you not stand up against them?
[02:17:52.710 --> 02:17:54.071]  How could you not fight them?
[02:17:54.672 --> 02:17:58.073]  How could you even question the need to resist and to speak out?
[02:17:58.133 --> 02:18:00.235]  And some people said afterwards, what do you mean they're so evil?
[02:18:00.335 --> 02:18:02.096]  That means even more reason not to fight them.
[02:18:03.056 --> 02:18:05.497]  You see, that just shows the different world some of us are in.
[02:18:05.518 --> 02:18:09.920]  It's an instinctive need to defend decency and honor and family.
[02:18:10.643 --> 02:18:13.844]  And to stand up against dehumanization and total world slavery.
[02:18:14.404 --> 02:18:18.285]  I have a debt, a need for those that came before me that stood up and fought.
[02:18:18.545 --> 02:18:19.805]  And for those that come in the future.
[02:18:20.265 --> 02:18:29.287]  If you love your family, if you have any even mammalian instincts, you know, mammal ingrained technologies that God put into us.
[02:18:29.347 --> 02:18:30.567]  Can't you defend the young?
[02:18:30.607 --> 02:18:31.767]  Can't you defend the family?
[02:18:32.067 --> 02:18:33.608]  Can't you stand up against a threat?
[02:18:33.868 --> 02:18:34.948]  Where's your humanity?
[02:18:37.011 --> 02:18:47.096]  I mean, when you see a giant, wicked, stinking, murdering juggernaut engaging in every crime imaginable, stinking to high heaven, how do you not resist it?
[02:18:47.497 --> 02:18:48.777]  How do you not fight it?
[02:18:50.298 --> 02:18:55.881]  And in numbers, and in standing up, and in being bold, and in being leaders, we have more safety.
[02:18:57.042 --> 02:18:59.703]  You give license to this system, it's over!
[02:19:01.004 --> 02:19:04.766]  They eat those that serve them more readily than they destroy those that fight them!
[02:19:06.989 --> 02:19:09.170]  And people are going to come out from among this system.
[02:19:09.190 --> 02:19:15.332]  Some of their greatest servants will become our greatest fighters for liberty and humanity and decency.
[02:19:16.172 --> 02:19:17.292]  That's God's design.
[02:19:18.513 --> 02:19:19.873]  Be part of history.
[02:19:20.453 --> 02:19:21.413]  Life is so short.
[02:19:21.954 --> 02:19:23.894]  Things are so incredibly insane.
[02:19:24.134 --> 02:19:26.215]  The propaganda is so sophisticated.
[02:19:26.435 --> 02:19:27.975]  The lies are so legion.
[02:19:29.756 --> 02:19:30.536]  Joe in Oregon.
[02:19:30.576 --> 02:19:31.236]  You're on the air.
[02:19:31.276 --> 02:19:31.997]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:19:32.377 --> 02:19:33.097]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[02:19:33.217 --> 02:19:33.597]  Yes, sir.
[02:19:33.637 --> 02:19:35.958]  Let me get away from the speakers there.
[02:19:38.468 --> 02:19:47.707]  Right now, things are so serious with the open borders of millions of illegals that don't give a darn.
[02:19:48.425 --> 02:19:57.149]  About constitutional law, republic... And then people arrest folks that are trespassing on their fenced land, and they give them blankets, and the police come and arrest them.
[02:19:57.710 --> 02:20:03.993]  As Mexican troops kill federal officers on a routine basis, shoot up vehicles every week, but that's okay.
[02:20:04.353 --> 02:20:07.415]  Our government's putting water supply systems in the desert for the illegals.
[02:20:07.695 --> 02:20:12.477]  But tells you the Pentagon's going to watch everything you do as a citizen for your safety.
[02:20:13.077 --> 02:20:18.000]  Well, my point is that it's important for a government
[02:20:18.850 --> 02:20:32.500]  To do this, so they can come up with excuses for the martial law, for removing our weapons, for removing our liberties, because you have a bulk of these people running around demanding their rights, and demanding bilingualism, etc., etc.
[02:20:32.520 --> 02:20:38.564]  You got the Pope with his New World pronouncements, etc., etc.
[02:20:38.904 --> 02:20:47.711]  Things are so serious, I'm just wondering what it's going to take for the bulk of our people to get up off their behinds and turn off that damn TV!
[02:20:48.391 --> 02:20:49.872]  Sir, please watch your language.
[02:20:50.032 --> 02:20:50.453]  Pardon me.
[02:20:52.214 --> 02:20:53.034]  I'm dead serious.
[02:20:53.214 --> 02:20:54.275]  Everybody's just quit that.
[02:20:54.295 --> 02:20:56.777]  I have a very good memory and I'm going to start banning people from the show.
[02:20:57.638 --> 02:21:03.462]  Look, I'm not mad at you, Joe, and I understand your frustration, your anger, but we have to be better than everybody else.
[02:21:03.502 --> 02:21:04.682]  We have to be upright.
[02:21:05.043 --> 02:21:05.223]  Right.
[02:21:05.283 --> 02:21:06.664]  And I'm telling myself that as well.
[02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:07.785]  Let me answer your question.
[02:21:09.185 --> 02:21:14.149]  Number one, the old white men in New York fund Mecha and La Raza.
[02:21:14.864 --> 02:21:18.245]  Mecha says kill all whites, drive them out of the West.
[02:21:18.305 --> 02:21:19.305]  It's on their websites.
[02:21:19.406 --> 02:21:20.266]  I have their flyers.
[02:21:20.606 --> 02:21:24.307]  I have them on video with images of blonde-haired, blue-eyed people with their heads cut off.
[02:21:24.907 --> 02:21:29.249]  I don't like the Klan and I don't like Mecha, but they're all funded by the Feds.
[02:21:29.669 --> 02:21:31.829]  The media tries to make it a racial issue.
[02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:42.493]  We got, and it's not, we got 400 million Latin Americans, 20 million plus new births every year coming this way
[02:21:43.553 --> 02:21:48.557]  There are at least 40 million illegals here, 20 million naturalized in the last 15 years.
[02:21:48.577 --> 02:21:50.338]  That's 60 million people.
[02:21:51.839 --> 02:22:01.526]  They're creating a Tower of Babel so we can't communicate, and the illegals, whether they're from Russia, China, or Mexico, we always talk about Latin America because that's the majority, driving down the wages.
[02:22:01.927 --> 02:22:07.431]  Our Southwest is turning into a big Mexico City, the most dangerous crime-ridden city in the world.
[02:22:08.574 --> 02:22:12.639]  They're setting up Latin American mordido and kickbacks and corruption.
[02:22:13.119 --> 02:22:16.082]  They're flying the Mexican flag in towns like El Cenizo.
[02:22:16.663 --> 02:22:18.444]  You're not allowed to speak English in court.
[02:22:18.685 --> 02:22:20.346]  Let me just finish, let me just finish.
[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:26.562]  The biggest so-called group listening to this show in Austin, Texas is Hispanics.
[02:22:26.922 --> 02:22:30.624]  More patriotic than you or I. Great veterans for this country.
[02:22:31.004 --> 02:22:31.845]  They're upset.
[02:22:32.205 --> 02:22:35.166]  In major polls, 80% of Hispanics are against what's happening.
[02:22:35.446 --> 02:22:37.187]  The media tries to make it racial.
[02:22:37.487 --> 02:22:41.009]  We've got to have Hispanic groups formed to stop the illegal immigration.
[02:22:41.209 --> 02:22:45.210]  And I call for those leaders to do that and to stand up for the sovereignty of this country.
[02:22:45.250 --> 02:22:45.771]  Anything else?
[02:22:46.651 --> 02:22:50.794]  Cesar Chavez in his beginning, that communist... Unadmitted communist, yes.
[02:22:50.854 --> 02:22:54.436]  He was against open borders to keep wages up of Mexicans.
[02:22:54.696 --> 02:23:03.882]  But the fact of the matter is that these Mexicans that are against any more illegal immigration, because they know what a mess Central America is... Stay there, we'll be right back.
[02:23:06.204 --> 02:23:09.246]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:23:10.126 --> 02:23:12.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.979 --> 02:23:17.740]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:23.704]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:23:23.944 --> 02:23:28.787]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the water pump 803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:23:28.907 --> 02:23:30.468]  That's 808-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:23:54.169 --> 02:23:56.290]  And I won't back down, baby.
[02:24:20.641 --> 02:24:22.023]  All right, let's go back to the calls.
[02:24:22.143 --> 02:24:23.825]  Joe and Oregon, real quick, finish up.
[02:24:23.845 --> 02:24:25.547]  Then we'll go to Brian, Matt, Lisa, and others.
[02:24:25.587 --> 02:24:26.609]  Go ahead.
[02:24:26.709 --> 02:24:27.069]  Thank you.
[02:24:27.430 --> 02:24:35.079]  I wanted to say that DARE.com, they have a story on their section about a 41-year-old computer program.
[02:24:35.384 --> 02:24:39.368]  The Bank of America who commits suicide because of a 21B bill.
[02:24:39.568 --> 02:24:41.170]  Well, sir, I think your phone's cutting out.
[02:24:41.210 --> 02:24:42.391]  Is it out of power or something?
[02:24:42.691 --> 02:24:48.317]  Yeah, I'll have to let you go, but you can't dare out about what's happening and Americans are committing suicide now.
[02:24:48.337 --> 02:24:48.617]  I hear you.
[02:24:48.637 --> 02:24:49.538]  I appreciate the call.
[02:24:49.598 --> 02:24:53.502]  And now the government's signed bills that ship almost all of the high-tech jobs and other jobs.
[02:24:54.102 --> 02:24:54.822]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[02:25:17.805 --> 02:25:20.006]  I've been listening to your show for about a year and a half.
[02:25:20.846 --> 02:25:26.908]  One day I was running through the channels and I come across this guy that's ranting and raving about this and that.
[02:25:27.288 --> 02:25:29.488]  I thought, wow, what's this guy got to say?
[02:25:30.509 --> 02:25:34.150]  I've been checking into what you've been saying for the last year and a half.
[02:25:35.290 --> 02:25:38.911]  I keep finding what you're saying to be fact and truth.
[02:25:40.371 --> 02:25:43.932]  It's not just your opinion, like a lot of the other talk shows have.
[02:25:43.992 --> 02:25:45.413]  I listen to a lot of talk shows.
[02:25:47.202 --> 02:25:52.044]  But I wanted to bring up about this cashless society.
[02:25:52.104 --> 02:25:56.106]  I've talked to you about this before.
[02:25:57.087 --> 02:26:02.429]  My employer has required me to accept a pay card.
[02:26:03.570 --> 02:26:05.711]  It's either that or I would be unemployed.
[02:26:07.752 --> 02:26:10.274]  And then they automatically transfer the money to your account.
[02:26:10.314 --> 02:26:11.494]  They're pushing hard for that.
[02:26:11.514 --> 02:26:14.576]  There's actually a law I don't have in front of me that cannot make you do that.
[02:26:14.996 --> 02:26:16.457]  This is all part of getting rid of cash.
[02:26:16.477 --> 02:26:18.738]  It's why the kids have to thumb scan to get their school lunches.
[02:26:19.118 --> 02:26:20.059]  College students now.
[02:26:20.179 --> 02:26:21.359]  Thousands of school districts.
[02:26:21.980 --> 02:26:23.660]  Training you for the cashless society.
[02:26:23.701 --> 02:26:25.501]  Getting you into the databases is now admitted.
[02:26:26.262 --> 02:26:26.602]  Correct.
[02:26:27.342 --> 02:26:29.664]  And now I'm being penalized.
[02:26:29.684 --> 02:26:33.205]  If I want to withdraw cash, I can do it twice a month for free.
[02:26:33.986 --> 02:26:36.407]  Any other time I'm charged $4 per withdrawal.
[02:26:37.065 --> 02:26:41.367]  So it's a penalty for having cash, you know?
[02:26:41.447 --> 02:26:51.373]  The whole thing is, I really don't think it's anybody's business... Well, the Federal Reserve has said you'll still have cash with the RFID tracking strip that's been in them for six years.
[02:26:51.753 --> 02:26:56.676]  They will devalue it if you get it out of ATMs, out of banks, if you don't keep it in the bank.
[02:26:56.756 --> 02:27:03.019]  It's about forcing you on to a cashless system where you pay with a face scan, a retina scan, or a thumbprint.
[02:27:03.620 --> 02:27:04.240]  Correct, yes.
[02:27:04.944 --> 02:27:08.025]  And then, and then they're going to have taxes on fast food and everything.
[02:27:08.385 --> 02:27:12.305]  It's going to be administered, the Department of Agriculture has already said, through the biometrics.
[02:27:13.066 --> 02:27:13.366]  Correct.
[02:27:13.846 --> 02:27:18.747]  Also about the toxic hematitis, is there someone trying to abolish this?
[02:27:19.347 --> 02:27:20.807]  They already got rid of most of it in 96.
[02:27:21.167 --> 02:27:23.888]  There's a bill to get rid of all of it in the Senate right now.
[02:27:24.528 --> 02:27:28.669]  That's the 1878 law, barring the military from engaging in law enforcement activities.
[02:27:29.449 --> 02:27:30.409]  Who's behind that?
[02:27:31.224 --> 02:27:38.750]  Republicans and Democrats on key issues of open borders, taking your liberty, grabbing your guns, getting rid of Posi Comitatus, bringing in foreign troops.
[02:27:38.770 --> 02:27:39.610]  They're all together.
[02:27:40.331 --> 02:27:40.511]  Yeah.
[02:27:41.312 --> 02:27:42.753]  Great world we're turning into.
[02:27:43.093 --> 02:27:46.095]  Well, we just got to get the word out and expose these neocons.
[02:27:46.115 --> 02:27:47.096]  They're the biggest problem.
[02:27:47.116 --> 02:27:47.756]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:48.096 --> 02:27:48.517]  Thank you.
[02:27:49.397 --> 02:27:49.778]  You bet.
[02:27:49.938 --> 02:27:50.879]  Matt in Missouri.
[02:27:50.919 --> 02:27:51.899]  You're on the air, Matt.
[02:27:51.959 --> 02:27:52.440]  Go ahead.
[02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:53.340]  Hello, Alex.
[02:27:53.741 --> 02:27:54.121]  Welcome.
[02:27:54.321 --> 02:27:58.044]  I just wanted to share something with you and your listeners that I stumbled onto.
[02:27:59.713 --> 02:28:01.654]  It's along the lines of aspartame.
[02:28:02.554 --> 02:28:07.896]  About three months ago, a friend of mine had stumbled on a yucca plant.
[02:28:07.996 --> 02:28:09.137]  You've heard of the yucca plant?
[02:28:13.418 --> 02:28:20.541]  In the past three months, he's lost 18 to 25 pounds, and his central nervous system is deteriorating.
[02:28:21.121 --> 02:28:26.023]  So I went online, I did a ton of research on the yucca plant, and I found that it's actually
[02:28:26.565 --> 02:28:34.150]  A poisonous plant that contains cyanide and has been used by the Mayans, you know, to poison their dart tips and their arrows.
[02:28:35.170 --> 02:28:36.391]  Well, do me a favor.
[02:28:36.491 --> 02:28:37.172]  That's interesting.
[02:28:37.192 --> 02:28:39.313]  Send me some information on that.
[02:28:39.353 --> 02:28:40.574]  Do you have my email address?
[02:28:40.814 --> 02:28:42.955]  Yes, I did send you an email earlier.
[02:28:42.975 --> 02:28:45.677]  It's AJshow at Infowars.com.
[02:28:45.717 --> 02:28:47.398]  I know that's sold in a lot of health food stores.
[02:28:47.438 --> 02:28:50.240]  I wonder if that's... I mean, it's massive.
[02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:55.283]  What I've discovered is that it's one of the most cyanide-containing plants there is.
[02:28:56.098 --> 02:29:04.842]  And that not only do we put it into cattle feed and pig feed as a filler, but it's also pure yucca extract is added to root beer.
[02:29:05.502 --> 02:29:08.843]  And it used to be sarsaparilla root, but now they use yucca extract.
[02:29:09.284 --> 02:29:12.605]  And if you think of the name yucca, that's where the word Mr. Yuck comes from.
[02:29:12.625 --> 02:29:19.208]  The name Yucca Mountain, where they store all the radioactive waste in the US.
[02:29:21.129 --> 02:29:23.950]  It's alarming to me and it definitely needs further research.
[02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:25.070]  I'll check it out.
[02:29:25.151 --> 02:29:36.514]  Aspartame in the 1983 National Soft Drink Report, the government admitted that it was wood alcohol, a deadly neurotoxin, so they went ahead and authorized it and put it in the drinks and now it's lost its patent.
[02:29:37.502 --> 02:29:41.785]  That's run out, so now everybody's putting it in the food because it's cheaper.
[02:29:41.805 --> 02:29:46.227]  9,000 plus foods have it, and now they just list it as a natural flavoring.
[02:29:46.527 --> 02:29:46.848]  Right.
[02:29:47.268 --> 02:29:48.649]  It's kind of the same with yucca.
[02:29:48.689 --> 02:29:57.353]  There's a lot of websites that tout its benefits, saying it's good for arthritis and this and that, but I can't see taking cyanide being good for anything.
[02:29:57.834 --> 02:29:58.134]  I will.
[02:29:58.214 --> 02:29:59.195]  Send me information.
[02:29:59.455 --> 02:29:59.995]  I sure will.
[02:30:00.215 --> 02:30:01.996]  I'll tell you the best website to send it to.
[02:30:02.917 --> 02:30:06.279]  Send it to tips at InfoWars.com.
[02:30:06.579 --> 02:30:06.799]  Okay.
[02:30:07.521 --> 02:30:08.321]  Hey, I appreciate that.
[02:30:08.381 --> 02:30:11.082]  Tips at Infowars.com is the best one, actually.
[02:30:11.503 --> 02:30:13.803]  Tips at Infowars.com.
[02:30:15.084 --> 02:30:20.306]  All right, let's go ahead now and move along to Lisa in Pennsylvania.
[02:30:20.346 --> 02:30:21.266]  Lisa, you're on the air.
[02:30:21.706 --> 02:30:22.547]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:30:22.747 --> 02:30:23.067]  How you doing?
[02:30:23.127 --> 02:30:23.927]  I'm well, thanks.
[02:30:24.347 --> 02:30:25.328]  Alex, two questions.
[02:30:25.608 --> 02:30:37.192]  I watched your 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny video over the internet, and they made reference to a publication, I guess it was a brochure, that was distributed to local law enforcement agencies around the country.
[02:30:37.657 --> 02:30:39.398]  I'm not sure if it was distributed by the FBI.
[02:30:39.538 --> 02:30:43.140]  It was given out by the FBI in Maricopa County, Arizona.
[02:30:43.160 --> 02:30:45.842]  About 45,000 of them were handed out.
[02:30:46.322 --> 02:30:48.223]  It says, Report Terrorist Immediately.
[02:30:48.283 --> 02:30:50.745]  Terrorists say, quote, they are defenders of the U.S.
[02:30:50.785 --> 02:30:51.765]  Constitution.
[02:30:52.706 --> 02:30:54.667]  It lists gun organizations.
[02:30:55.848 --> 02:30:58.229]  Then we have their other training manuals, Megiddo and others.
[02:30:58.589 --> 02:31:00.690]  Oh yeah, Megiddo I'm familiar with.
[02:31:00.730 --> 02:31:01.171]  Christians.
[02:31:01.191 --> 02:31:06.794]  Then I have FEMA on video in Kansas City teaching police at the Founding Fathers, and Christians are terrorists.
[02:31:07.454 --> 02:31:08.074]  Question for you.
[02:31:08.154 --> 02:31:11.715]  The brochure that was distributed, is there a way I can get a copy of that?
[02:31:12.095 --> 02:31:14.296]  Yeah, it's on InfoWars.com.
[02:31:14.336 --> 02:31:17.456]  Just type in FBI flyer in the search engine.
[02:31:18.517 --> 02:31:19.017]  Okay, thank you.
[02:31:19.037 --> 02:31:27.179]  The other question I have is a few days ago you made reference to a code in US Code Title 50 about chemical weapons on American citizens.
[02:31:27.259 --> 02:31:29.379]  US Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B.
[02:31:33.630 --> 02:31:36.333]  1,500?
[02:31:34.251 --> 02:31:36.333]  I gotta say it fast to remember it.
[02:31:36.373 --> 02:31:37.615]  It's one of those rapid fire deals.
[02:31:37.635 --> 02:31:40.418]  You gotta type a phone number quick to remember it into the pad.
[02:31:40.438 --> 02:31:40.478]  U.S.
[02:31:40.498 --> 02:31:43.641]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B. Paragraph B. U.S.
[02:31:43.662 --> 02:31:44.983]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B.
[02:31:54.568 --> 02:31:54.888]  Okay.
[02:31:55.788 --> 02:32:01.429]  But, uh, and that says that they can't use chemical or biologicals on foreign troops, but on U.S.
[02:32:01.469 --> 02:32:05.870]  citizens, for any law enforcement purpose, including crowd control, they can kill all of us.
[02:32:06.410 --> 02:32:10.391]  Does it specifically state they can be lethal chemical weapons and things like that?
[02:32:10.551 --> 02:32:22.513]  Yes, it says, it's a long definition, but it says that they can use lethal chemical weapons, that they're authorized for testing, for defense, and for any law enforcement purpose, including crowd control.
[02:32:22.533 --> 02:32:23.193]  Is that right?
[02:32:24.637 --> 02:32:24.957]  Yes.
[02:32:25.337 --> 02:32:34.839]  And presumably... And the last year Reno was in, tons of sarin nerve gas were transferred to the Justice Department office in D.C.
[02:32:34.899 --> 02:32:38.000]  They have large amounts of lethal nerve gas for some reason.
[02:32:38.660 --> 02:32:48.403]  I seem to recall, one of your earlier calls brought up positive commentators, I seem to recall that former President Clinton signed an executive order in the later half of 1999, somehow or other suspending that... It was 96.
[02:32:48.443 --> 02:32:48.683]  Was it 96?
[02:32:54.505 --> 02:32:56.006]  There may have been another one in 99, but yeah.
[02:32:56.026 --> 02:32:58.187]  I thought there was one in 99 sometime in the August-September timeframe.
[02:32:58.207 --> 02:33:05.611]  Well, I've had the former JAG officer, the colonel on, who was over at Posse Comitatus, he's now a professor, and he said that it was gone, really gone, in 96.
[02:33:06.212 --> 02:33:08.253]  They got the troops, the police, ready for the rollout.
[02:33:08.653 --> 02:33:10.554]  Now the general public's being told about it.
[02:33:10.954 --> 02:33:11.215]  Okay.
[02:33:12.055 --> 02:33:18.659]  And I've got on video, or the audio clip here off Fox News, with Governor Ridge, the head of Homeland Security,
[02:33:20.895 --> 02:33:26.697]  Saying that they are getting rid of Posse Comitatus, to quote, have troops on the streets searching and seizing you.
[02:33:26.957 --> 02:33:29.298]  Right, right, right.
[02:33:29.698 --> 02:33:30.338]  Very interesting.
[02:33:30.798 --> 02:33:37.501]  Troops on the streets are bad in Baghdad under Saddam, or they're bad under Hitler on the streets, but here in America, it's all about freedom.
[02:33:38.741 --> 02:33:42.482]  Well, you know, it's very interesting, to say the least.
[02:33:42.562 --> 02:33:43.563]  We live in interesting times.
[02:33:45.083 --> 02:33:46.804]  We live in incredibly interesting times.
[02:33:46.824 --> 02:33:49.965]  What do you think about, did you hear about Ashcroft on TV this morning?
[02:33:51.012 --> 02:33:57.697]  Congress is saying they're going to get Patriot Act 2 in and arrest citizens and secretly execute them for any terrorist act?
[02:33:58.138 --> 02:34:00.700]  Well, yes Alex.
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:05.063]  My thoughts on this are probably a little bit more expensive than I could share in the time that we have.
[02:34:05.083 --> 02:34:07.665]  But Ashcroft said just a few months ago there is no Patriot Act 2.
[02:34:07.705 --> 02:34:08.926]  They didn't want to make it stronger.
[02:34:08.946 --> 02:34:11.148]  How dare anyone say that?
[02:34:11.868 --> 02:34:13.749]  Anyone that says this is aiding terrorists.
[02:34:13.810 --> 02:34:14.750]  Why, they're liars!
[02:34:15.991 --> 02:34:16.752]  Definitely.
[02:34:16.992 --> 02:34:20.534]  This tells me they're getting ready to move with more terror to legitimize this.
[02:34:21.535 --> 02:34:23.937]  Well, yeah, it certainly is a possibility.
[02:34:25.198 --> 02:34:28.961]  They introduced all the Patriot Act stuff piecemeal before 9-1-1.
[02:34:29.301 --> 02:34:33.424]  They introduced their Anti-Terrorism Act before Oklahoma City in 95.
[02:34:34.325 --> 02:34:36.446]  Same mode, same operation each time.
[02:34:36.726 --> 02:34:39.989]  It seems curious to me that there's some sort of
[02:34:40.925 --> 02:34:44.846]  Rationale for suggesting that in order to preserve freedom you can limit it.
[02:34:45.006 --> 02:34:48.087]  It's called Freedom Plus.
[02:34:48.647 --> 02:34:54.148]  Freedom Plus limits on that freedom, but the border stays wide open and every major terror group is funded by the CIA.
[02:34:55.729 --> 02:34:56.149]  Interesting.
[02:34:56.789 --> 02:34:57.869]  Alright, well thanks for your time.
[02:34:58.689 --> 02:35:08.692]  Absolutely, and if you're a good Christian boy at the CIA, you go join the Brotherhood and they tell you, well, dictatorship's good, it's what Jesus wants, before he'll come back, and Hitler was good, and
[02:35:09.824 --> 02:35:12.326]  Well, we believe Jesus is a spirit guide.
[02:35:12.486 --> 02:35:13.627]  Well, I'm a good Christian, then.
[02:35:13.687 --> 02:35:14.447]  I'm going to join you.
[02:35:16.729 --> 02:35:18.470]  Oh, we'll go to some more of your calls here in a minute.
[02:35:18.490 --> 02:35:24.134]  I want to take some more calls here in just a few minutes at 800-259-9231.
[02:35:24.154 --> 02:35:29.718]  But I've got some other news that I never seem to get to that needs to be covered here first.
[02:35:33.581 --> 02:35:36.883]  But before I do that, I just want you all to get my videos.
[02:35:36.903 --> 02:35:38.344]  You've heard a lot of people talking about them.
[02:35:39.594 --> 02:35:41.855]  See Ashcroft say there's no Patriot Act 2.
[02:35:42.275 --> 02:35:47.158]  See him say that those that say we're taking liberties with this are liars that ate Al-Qaeda and they will lose their liberty.
[02:35:47.978 --> 02:35:48.438]  See him!
[02:35:48.518 --> 02:35:53.121]  It's a 45 minutes of the 2 hour, 37 minute film is on Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[02:35:53.521 --> 02:35:57.923]  We cover Homeland Security, dozens of examples of government sponsored terror we didn't cover in other films.
[02:35:59.104 --> 02:36:02.245]  White government run, white slavery rings, all mainstream news.
[02:36:03.166 --> 02:36:05.086]  In your face telling you how wonderful it all is.
[02:36:06.407 --> 02:36:08.028]  We say it's evil, we're radical here.
[02:36:09.222 --> 02:36:16.467]  And, uh, gun control, forced vaccinations, Pan-American Union, a section on the New World Order and who they are and what their goals are.
[02:36:16.927 --> 02:36:22.091]  It's an incredible film, $25.95, over two and a half hours long.
[02:36:22.111 --> 02:36:25.513]  I also have 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, about 9-1-1 and the takeover there.
[02:36:25.933 --> 02:36:29.275]  Key information, Masters of Terrorist, part two of that.
[02:36:29.335 --> 02:36:30.876]  I have my book, The Set in a Tyranny, only $12.
[02:36:32.481 --> 02:36:34.942]  And it is 230 pages long.
[02:36:35.422 --> 02:36:36.962]  Get three or more of any of the videos.
[02:36:37.002 --> 02:36:38.463]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[02:36:38.863 --> 02:36:40.003]  Support the broadcast.
[02:36:40.063 --> 02:36:40.903]  Get the videos.
[02:36:40.983 --> 02:36:41.663]  Make copies.
[02:36:42.023 --> 02:36:43.864]  Wake your area up now!
[02:36:44.604 --> 02:36:45.904]  Through the alternative media.
[02:36:46.024 --> 02:36:51.426]  We have the power of the people to out-muscle the mainstream media propaganda arms.
[02:36:53.226 --> 02:36:54.747]  Call free number to order.
[02:36:55.847 --> 02:36:57.107]  Smash through the complacency.
[02:36:57.167 --> 02:36:57.707]  The lies.
[02:36:57.807 --> 02:36:58.908]  Break the paradigms.
[02:36:59.248 --> 02:36:59.968]  Order the videos.

[02:37:31.024 --> 02:37:34.526]  Make a copy every morning when you go to work, a copy when you go to sleep at night.
[02:37:34.546 --> 02:37:36.228]  Hand out the two copies each day.
[02:37:52.156 --> 02:37:53.217]  Get them out to key people.
[02:37:53.257 --> 02:37:54.318]  Get them out to the general public.
[02:37:54.358 --> 02:37:59.001]  Get them out to preachers, talk show hosts, lawyers, county commissioners, state reps, congressmen and women.
[02:38:00.622 --> 02:38:01.642]  Take action now.
[02:38:01.903 --> 02:38:03.083]  Smash the paradigm.
[02:38:03.163 --> 02:38:06.666]  Have the mass awakening, the renaissance, the revelation now.
[02:38:08.407 --> 02:38:08.787]  Do it!
[02:38:09.428 --> 02:38:10.628]  It is so important.
[02:38:11.549 --> 02:38:13.130]  This is how we protect ourselves too.
[02:38:14.811 --> 02:38:20.375]  Because there's so many of us popping up and our works go on and if the secret's already out of the bag, there's no reason to go after you.
[02:38:21.081 --> 02:38:24.563]  It's when you hide in darkness that the predators can feed on you.
[02:38:26.104 --> 02:38:26.464]  China!
[02:38:26.484 --> 02:38:28.246]  The reality of persecution!
[02:38:28.266 --> 02:38:30.827]  This is out of Enough magazine.
[02:38:31.348 --> 02:38:35.590]  Enough has obtained photos, smuggled out of China, of the Chinese police torturing Christians.
[02:38:35.650 --> 02:38:37.271]  Here is the story behind the photos.
[02:38:38.472 --> 02:38:46.017]  And there's all these photos on Infowars.com of them torturing Christians as they lean back with enjoyed looks on their faces, smoking cigarettes.
[02:38:46.644 --> 02:38:53.728]  We have photos also out of mainstream news where they're choking people as they lead into mass execution vans that our government has helped fund.
[02:38:55.249 --> 02:39:07.435]  Study links 9-1-1 Gulf War vets and birth defects, AP, Associated Press, children of veterans of 91 Gulf War are more likely to have three specific birth defects of those soldiers who were never served in the Gulf.
[02:39:07.455 --> 02:39:11.978]  A government study has found they now admit all this is true ten years after, twelve years after.
[02:39:12.518 --> 02:39:12.938]  We're good to go.
[02:39:32.009 --> 02:39:41.095]  Researchers said they did not have enough information to link the birth defects to possible exposures to poisonous substances, which many Gulf War veterans suspect are culprits of their mysterious illnesses.
[02:39:41.135 --> 02:39:45.658]  Well, they shut down the factory that made the anthrax shot and it's reopened.
[02:39:45.678 --> 02:39:51.622]  It was full of bizarre genetically engineered mycoplasms, toxins, a huffed nerve gas.
[02:39:51.902 --> 02:39:53.803]  Major universities have come out with that evidence.
[02:39:53.943 --> 02:39:56.185]  The brain scans show it, but I don't give them treatment.
[02:39:58.045 --> 02:40:00.526]  Continuing, Russia to send nuclear fuel to Iran.
[02:40:00.646 --> 02:40:05.649]  Reuters, a foreign military official said Russia would supply Iran with fuel for a nuclear reactor.
[02:40:06.129 --> 02:40:11.011]  Whether or not Tehran signs an additional protocol, the UN nuclear watchdog ITAR-Tahoe didn't report it.
[02:40:12.452 --> 02:40:14.313]  And on all tobacco products, U.S.
[02:40:14.353 --> 02:40:16.134]  Health Chief Richard Kimona
[02:40:16.792 --> 02:40:28.014]  Dr. Carmona, the Surgeon General of the United States, has said he would support an abolition of cigarettes and all tobacco products, the first time that such a senior public health official has taken that kind of stand over the industry.
[02:40:28.374 --> 02:40:33.715]  But the government says, no, we're just going to have a federal tax and refuse you health care if you don't take it.
[02:40:34.275 --> 02:40:40.116]  And your national ID card, of course, that you already have in your back pocket as your driver's license will control that.
[02:40:40.836 --> 02:40:46.097]  Dr. Carmona's statement was welcomed yesterday by anti-smoking organizations condemned by the tobacco industry.
[02:40:46.852 --> 02:40:47.553]  Where does it end?
[02:40:47.613 --> 02:40:49.675]  Well, now Oreo cookies and fast food.
[02:40:51.917 --> 02:40:55.581]  It goes on and on and on and on and on.
[02:40:55.901 --> 02:41:02.308]  A Canadian bull sold to Montana came from a herd that contained mad cow.
[02:41:02.328 --> 02:41:04.870]  The Montana Department of Livestock has been asked by the U.S.
[02:41:04.890 --> 02:41:07.553]  Department of Agriculture to assist in the conducting of trace
[02:41:08.470 --> 02:41:15.535]  Trace back five yearling bulls that were imported from a herd of Sasquatch and Saskatchewan in May of 97.
[02:41:16.275 --> 02:41:25.581]  The Saskatchewan herd was identified as the trace herd from the index herd of the cow and Canada diagnosed with BSE or the spongiform encephalopathy.
[02:41:26.401 --> 02:41:31.665]  We are in the process of reviewing our livestock inspector records and animal health records in terms of livestock shipments.
[02:41:32.105 --> 02:41:34.747]  More on this with another news blitz on the other side.
[02:41:37.910 --> 02:41:40.831]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:41:41.512 --> 02:41:42.792]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:41:42.992 --> 02:41:48.735]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:41:49.015 --> 02:41:54.277]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:41:54.557 --> 02:41:58.679]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination has blown wide open.
[02:41:58.999 --> 02:42:02.661]  Nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:42:02.922 --> 02:42:07.565]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:42:07.645 --> 02:42:13.909]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:42:13.949 --> 02:42:15.770]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:42:40.542 --> 02:42:44.044]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[02:44:37.382 --> 02:44:52.255]  Alright, we'll talk to Michael Howell and DJ here real quick as final callers.
[02:44:52.275 --> 02:44:54.337]  I'll give you both about 60 seconds apiece.
[02:44:54.997 --> 02:44:56.539]  I ended the show on this yesterday.
[02:44:56.599 --> 02:44:58.040]  I'm never spending enough time on it.
[02:44:59.089 --> 02:44:59.589]  I should.
[02:44:59.609 --> 02:45:01.370]  Global tax on guns.
[02:45:01.390 --> 02:45:02.110]  We're on that daily.
[02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:05.432]  Brazil, France propose international levy on arms sales to eliminate world hunger.
[02:45:05.452 --> 02:45:07.733]  And our government thinks it's a wonderful idea.
[02:45:07.753 --> 02:45:12.294]  We also have Seattle protesters decry secret police.
[02:45:12.314 --> 02:45:13.755]  And they were also attacked by them.
[02:45:13.775 --> 02:45:15.696]  Again, police using pepper spray.
[02:45:16.196 --> 02:45:17.817]  Arrested 12 people at a March rally.
[02:45:17.837 --> 02:45:19.517]  They were meeting with the CIA.
[02:45:20.778 --> 02:45:22.298]  Big Brother, not watching you.
[02:45:22.699 --> 02:45:23.759]  You're wearing him.
[02:45:26.906 --> 02:45:27.387]  We're good to go.
[02:45:42.822 --> 02:45:43.363]  That goes on.
[02:45:43.403 --> 02:45:49.569]  But let's suppose a retailer fails to disable or remote the device at the checkout counter and the article or buyer continues to be tracked.
[02:45:49.949 --> 02:45:59.299]  This could be quite useful for supplier-retailer collection, value marketing, data, and targeting marketing companies, especially when the article being tracked is an item of clothing.
[02:45:59.319 --> 02:46:02.422]  And it just so happens Walmart is doing a test of this in a city in Arkansas.
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:07.302]  However, it also raises the issue of privacy, especially if the wearer is being tracked unwittingly.
[02:46:07.342 --> 02:46:12.704]  Furthermore, in the wrong hands, such a device could be used for malicious and nefarious purposes.
[02:46:14.745 --> 02:46:20.828]  So, the scenario is already becoming a reality with the introduction of affordable smart labels based on radio frequency identification.
[02:46:20.848 --> 02:46:23.389]  It's already in half of all Walmart products.
[02:46:23.849 --> 02:46:24.870]  Want to buy slave goods?
[02:46:24.890 --> 02:46:25.750]  You're going to be a slave.
[02:46:26.130 --> 02:46:27.110]  Who's up first, Mark?
[02:46:29.231 --> 02:46:30.292]  Who should I go to first?
[02:46:31.949 --> 02:46:33.910]  Howell in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:46:33.950 --> 02:46:34.411]  Go ahead.
[02:46:34.431 --> 02:46:35.892]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:46:36.112 --> 02:46:37.012]  I have a question.
[02:46:37.333 --> 02:46:37.953]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:46:37.973 --> 02:46:43.517]  They say that all Christians are terrorists, right?
[02:46:43.737 --> 02:46:48.420]  They say George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, all Christians are enemies of the federal government.
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:56.225]  I have FEMA on video in Kansas City to a classroom of police and I have their training manuals saying homeschoolers, Christians, everyone.
[02:46:57.319 --> 02:47:04.123]  Okay, by their definition then, wouldn't Seth describe Christian George Bush be a terrorist?
[02:47:04.243 --> 02:47:08.126]  Let's see, he all says he's Christian to neutralize everybody with his brotherhood group.
[02:47:09.367 --> 02:47:21.194]  They mean to be simple with police they say all Christians, but this is to be selectively enforced and now the headlines is Rudolph a Christian terrorist or we have to watch all the Christians now the Washington Post said.
[02:47:22.478 --> 02:47:23.879]  But you see my point, don't you?
[02:47:23.979 --> 02:47:24.980]  Oh, I see your point.
[02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:27.102]  Look, they say that defenders of the U.S.
[02:47:27.142 --> 02:47:32.247]  Constitution are terrorists in their training manuals when the cops have sworn an oath to uphold that.
[02:47:32.627 --> 02:47:33.908]  And you're thinking this is crazy.
[02:47:34.229 --> 02:47:39.053]  In Road to Tyranny, we have them pulling a housewife over, arresting her because she has a pocket constitution.
[02:47:39.353 --> 02:47:40.935]  They discuss, is it legal?
[02:47:42.116 --> 02:47:43.117]  Okay, one more.
[02:47:43.777 --> 02:47:48.662]  Are you aware that under this weapons of mass destruction phony term,
[02:47:49.301 --> 02:47:58.168]  Are you aware that Los Alamos builds atomic bombs, but Los Alamos County has a law against fireworks, even Roman candles?
[02:47:58.829 --> 02:48:02.411]  I know, and we may not be able to get fireworks this season.
[02:48:02.672 --> 02:48:06.054]  For sure next season, because they're not going to allow the shipment of fireworks now.
[02:48:06.354 --> 02:48:09.877]  And Estes Rockets might disappear because they can't even ship toy rockets to kids.
[02:48:10.137 --> 02:48:10.838]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:11.398 --> 02:48:13.240]  DJ, where are you calling us from today, sir?
[02:48:13.260 --> 02:48:14.361]  Austin.
[02:48:15.141 --> 02:48:15.382]  Where?
[02:48:15.402 --> 02:48:16.943]  Austin, Texas.
[02:48:17.103 --> 02:48:17.463]  Go ahead.
[02:48:17.483 --> 02:48:18.064]  You're on the air.
[02:48:18.104 --> 02:48:18.404]  Welcome.
[02:48:19.262 --> 02:48:22.504]  I heard some information that you might be interested in.
[02:48:22.805 --> 02:48:27.768]  I work as a courier and one of the places I run for is banks.
[02:48:27.788 --> 02:48:31.330]  Can you tell us what the banks do?
[02:48:32.291 --> 02:48:46.300]  Well, the problem here is I was doing a delivery and I happened to overhear during a training session where they were talking about that none of their branches had made a profit of the last quarter.
[02:48:49.341 --> 02:48:53.984]  I was thinking to myself, you know, this is something they never tell the general public.
[02:48:56.566 --> 02:48:57.346]  Absolutely.
[02:48:58.167 --> 02:49:00.348]  And people are thinking their banks are safe.
[02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:04.291]  I think they need to think again.
[02:49:05.061 --> 02:49:08.162]  Absolutely, and this is being designed to consolidate power.
[02:49:08.222 --> 02:49:10.083]  Thanks for the call, DJ, from Austin, Texas.
[02:49:10.103 --> 02:49:10.903]  Sorry I'm out of time.
[02:49:11.623 --> 02:49:20.286]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central, on your local AM or FM dial, or internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, or Global Shortwave at 5.085 and 6890.
[02:49:21.567 --> 02:49:22.407]  God bless you all.
[02:49:22.447 --> 02:49:23.027]  Stand up.
[02:49:23.607 --> 02:49:25.528]  Stand up against evil, or it's going to take over.
[02:49:27.424 --> 02:49:32.829]  Millions of people who've never set foot in a casino take a dangerous gamble every day.
[02:49:33.209 --> 02:49:34.850]  Living without health insurance.
[02:49:35.090 --> 02:49:37.192]  You can't afford not to have it.
[02:49:37.372 --> 02:49:38.033]  But affordable...
