[00:00:02.825 --> 00:00:06.088]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:15.258]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.060]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.862]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:20.263]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:21.364]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:26.482]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:30.863]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:33.644]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:36.785]  It's already the 22nd of May, 2003.
[00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:44.767]  I'm Alex Jones, your host on this live, Thursday, worldwide edition...
[00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:57.750]  As we go out on the AM and FM dials, simulcast on the Internet, at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and on Global Shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20 from 11 to 2 Central, and back from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.430]  Again, thank you for joining me today.
[00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.570]  Big, big show lined up.
[00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:13.747]  Tomorrow I have Jim Tucker from American Free Press joining us.
[00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:37.902]  He just got back from France where Donald Rumsfeld and Richard Pearl and everyone else were meeting to get their orders from the Europeans, all part of this staged fight as they engage in the military takeover of sovereign nations under the orders of their banker masters and as they drive down the dollar purposely in everyone's face.
[00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:41.607]  A blast has hit Istanbul restaurant.
[00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:48.130]  The second bombing in Turkey since the weekend, the last five days.
[00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:55.855]  Also, the FBI is quizzing Yale students after a bomb of some type went off in the Yale Law School.
[00:01:56.695 --> 00:02:00.257]  Of course, Yale is Bush's Stolen Bones alma mater.
[00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:03.119]  He was in the state surveying his troops.
[00:02:04.702 --> 00:02:07.903]  And we'll cover that situation for you.
[00:02:08.123 --> 00:02:13.604]  Also, world shuns Canadian beef over mad cow fears as that spreads.
[00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:23.427]  Federal government says that SARS is going to spread real bad probably next winter, and they may have to lock everything down and forcibly inject you, but that's okay.
[00:02:23.447 --> 00:02:23.927]  They love you.
[00:02:24.597 --> 00:02:27.679]  Military on highest domestic terror threat alert.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.823]  They're on the highest alert, but the general public is on an orange alert.
[00:02:31.843 --> 00:02:34.264]  We'll get to that out of the Washington Post.
[00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:38.408]  An earthquake kills more than 640 in Algeria.
[00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:42.010]  A Tarrytown judge remarked sparks outrage.
[00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.952]  A Muslim woman had gotten two parking tickets.
[00:02:44.972 --> 00:02:46.053]  She came in to see the judge.
[00:02:46.093 --> 00:02:48.355]  He said, are you a terrorist?
[00:02:48.415 --> 00:02:49.896]  And she fainted in fear.
[00:02:50.477 --> 00:02:52.158]  This shows the insanity of the government.
[00:02:53.058 --> 00:02:57.123]  Also, allies to begin seizing weapons from most Iraqis.
[00:02:57.183 --> 00:03:00.586]  Gun confiscation is beginning, something Saddam didn't do.
[00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:07.314]  Also, Iraqi conference to choose interim authority delayed because of all the looting and problems.
[00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:13.000]  And that's just the puppet group they're going to be appointing.
[00:03:14.091 --> 00:03:17.113]  So we'll be covering the facets of that for you.
[00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:20.235]  Chirac to embarrass Bush at G8 conference.
[00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:23.117]  Again, more of this stage left-right fight that's going on.
[00:03:23.137 --> 00:03:30.442]  The New York Times, two paths of Bayer drug in the 80s, riskier type, went overseas.
[00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:34.124]  That was the blood product full of the HIV and hepatitis.
[00:03:34.644 --> 00:03:35.865]  Our government knew what was in it.
[00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:37.126]  It was coming out of the prisons.
[00:03:38.078 --> 00:03:48.441]  Bill Clinton was involved in the front lines of making money off this, and it caused hundreds of thousands to get AIDS and hepatitis C and B. Again, here's that article I mentioned earlier.
[00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:51.742]  SARS outbreak could flare this winter, experts warn.
[00:03:52.422 --> 00:03:55.143]  Two more farms quarantined in Mad Cow Probe.
[00:03:55.343 --> 00:03:59.184]  FDA shots are approved to neuter puppies.
[00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:06.526]  Now, the UN's already been caught in Africa and other third world sectors of the global slave system.
[00:04:07.626 --> 00:04:08.367]  We're good to go.
[00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.793]  We're good to go.
[00:04:44.655 --> 00:04:45.716]  Thoughts coming up as well.
[00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:47.617]  I haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:04:47.837 --> 00:04:50.318]  Big show for you today.
[00:04:50.878 --> 00:04:51.498]  Stay with us.
[00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:59.742]  I'm Alex E. Jones, right here in Austin, Texas, hooked in with the great folks at Genesis Communications up in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[00:05:00.562 --> 00:05:04.304]  We'll be right back with more of the news, your calls, and a bunch of guests today.
[00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:07.086]  Stay with me, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:10.405 --> 00:05:14.287]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:05:14.527 --> 00:05:19.970]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:30.596]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:05:30.777 --> 00:05:35.119]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:43.645]  Try Halo Methane and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and MTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:50.311]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:54.894]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:55.114 --> 00:05:59.337]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:05:59.698 --> 00:06:03.941]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at
[00:06:04.301 --> 00:06:05.241]  888-803-4438.
[00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:07.722]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:07.782 --> 00:06:18.204]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:18.464 --> 00:06:23.205]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:29.066]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:33.848]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:06:34.068 --> 00:06:41.210]  The cashless society control grid, impalpable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.772]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:06:45.932 --> 00:06:48.433]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:06:48.673 --> 00:06:55.395]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:06:55.635 --> 00:07:00.881]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:00.901 --> 00:07:01.321]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:09.739 --> 00:07:12.340]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:18.324]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:19.924]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:07:20.024 --> 00:07:23.726]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[00:07:23.886 --> 00:07:32.571]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and corella, the two most important protein superfoods known.
[00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:33.531]  We're good to go.
[00:07:51.557 --> 00:07:55.760]  Listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley Sunday evenings at 6 p.m.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.221]  Central, 7 Eastern.
[00:07:57.421 --> 00:08:06.187]  Call 1-888-826-4448 to learn more or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[00:08:06.367 --> 00:08:08.949]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[00:08:10.905 --> 00:08:13.067]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.530]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.576 --> 00:08:25.097]  There have been more bombings.
[00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:28.580]  A restaurant got bombed in Istanbul, Turkey.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.121]  The second bombing in a week there.
[00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:35.326]  Some type of small bomb went off in a classroom at Yale.
[00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:49.415]  Where one of the emperor's daughters goes, as well as the emperor himself went there, there at the globalist training ground, there at the order of death, skull and bones.
[00:08:49.455 --> 00:08:52.656]  We'll talk about that, the dollar plunging even more.
[00:08:53.976 --> 00:09:00.838]  The globalists are greedily destroying our economy with pleasure, and the public is thanking the government for it during the Orange Alert.
[00:09:01.664 --> 00:09:02.224]  We're good to go.
[00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:27.577]  Yesterday I read an article, MMR kids five times more likely to develop autism.
[00:09:28.077 --> 00:09:39.865]  Fears over the safety of the MMR vaccine were reignited yesterday after a controversial study claimed it put children at a much greater risk of neurological disorders, not just autism, but brain damage.
[00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.233]  And autism is up over 3,000% in England, 2,000% in this country.
[00:09:46.273 --> 00:09:49.035]  People take their babies to get the vaccines at 18 months.
[00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:51.236]  They're happily talking to their mommy and daddy.
[00:09:51.296 --> 00:09:52.897]  Hours later, they're in convulsions.
[00:09:53.257 --> 00:09:54.258]  Many cases die.
[00:09:54.338 --> 00:09:56.059]  Many cases of brain damage for life.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.462]  Across the board, though, you do have an IQ reduction in your children.
[00:10:01.082 --> 00:10:06.506]  It is the hormones that are being added and other chemicals that attack the cerebral cortex during key development zones.
[00:10:07.822 --> 00:10:09.463]  But they're not just attacking that.
[00:10:09.523 --> 00:10:27.268]  There is an article today that we need to discuss because I've been reporting on this for about four years now since I first learned of it when the United Nations got caught carrying this out in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
[00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:30.909]  It is a CNN story.
[00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.391]  It says FDA approves shot to neuter puppies.
[00:10:36.548 --> 00:10:39.651]  FDA approves shot to neuter puppies.
[00:10:39.731 --> 00:11:00.047]  Now, the United Nations was caught in a program that was only for the women, because the UN cares so much for the women, it was all couched in feminist terms, that tetanus inoculations were to be given by the UN, and countries were paid off to carry these out,
[00:11:02.026 --> 00:11:08.881]  And in some cases, you and troops actually did the injecting to the point now where Africa refuses most of the injections and refuses the genetically modified food.
[00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:09.883]  They don't trust anything.
[00:11:10.244 --> 00:11:12.108]  If Africa can figure it out, why can't we?
[00:11:14.255 --> 00:11:27.019]  They would give the women the injections and millions of them were then sterilized and then they tested some of the shots, some of the inoculations and found that a key hormone had been added to the tetanus pathogen.
[00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:43.784]  That way when the body became immune to the tetanus shot from the inoculation it would also associate the tetanus with the hormone and when the young girl would go into puberty and become pregnant she would be unable to carry the baby past the first few months and would have a violent miscarriage
[00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:50.571]  Because the body did not have the hormone, because the immune system would attack the glands that produce it.
[00:11:51.952 --> 00:11:56.797]  It's a horrible system, caused massive illnesses, not just the sterilization.
[00:11:57.702 --> 00:12:03.427]  Well, I remember hearing about this four and a half years ago, maybe five years ago, when the UN got caught doing this.
[00:12:03.467 --> 00:12:04.928]  It was in the back of a few newspapers.
[00:12:05.268 --> 00:12:06.489]  They claimed it was an accident.
[00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:08.591]  Of course, it wouldn't have hurt men.
[00:12:09.351 --> 00:12:11.033]  But the program wasn't for men.
[00:12:11.073 --> 00:12:12.494]  It just so happened to be for women.
[00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:20.060]  And the UN said that in 130 countries they did it, that they just added the female hormone by accident, a very expensive synthetic hormone.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:26.863]  Harmone, dozens of different manufacturers, they all just accidentally added this to the tetanus shot.
[00:12:26.903 --> 00:12:29.283]  If you want to believe that, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:12:30.544 --> 00:12:35.706]  And of course, the UN at the same time is saying they've got to reduce world population, got to sterilize people.
[00:12:35.746 --> 00:12:42.288]  We have government reports from Australia, the UK, the US, about plans in the 50s calling for programs along these lines.
[00:12:42.668 --> 00:12:46.790]  We know the globalists are obsessed with population reduction, and lo and behold, it happens.
[00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:48.731]  We're good to go.
[00:13:07.501 --> 00:13:08.402]  We're good to go.
[00:13:32.992 --> 00:13:33.593]  We're good to go.
[00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:50.451]  It is massive.
[00:13:51.031 --> 00:13:52.372]  Absolutely massive.
[00:13:52.432 --> 00:13:54.514]  Just keep taking your vaccines, folks.
[00:13:54.594 --> 00:13:55.455]  If you do, you're nuts.
[00:13:56.016 --> 00:13:56.396]  Here it is.
[00:13:56.516 --> 00:13:58.198]  FDA-approved shot to neuter puppies.
[00:13:58.558 --> 00:14:01.961]  Veterinarians now can offer an alternative to surgery to neuter puppies.
[00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:03.603]  Oh, yeah, I'm sure this is real good for your dogs.
[00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:06.405]  Yeah, having the body attack glands.
[00:14:06.806 --> 00:14:08.447]  No, that's really a kind of cancer.
[00:14:08.467 --> 00:14:08.607]  Cold.
[00:14:12.231 --> 00:14:19.018]  Nutersol, it's a shot administered directly into the testicles of puppies at the right age for neutering.
[00:14:19.478 --> 00:14:26.766]  The ingredients, the amino acid I-arginine and zinc salt cause the testicles and prostate to atrophy.
[00:14:26.806 --> 00:14:31.951]  So this is just injecting an acid into them, basically, not the hormonal injection.
[00:14:32.672 --> 00:14:35.815]  Because I guess if you did that to dogs, then there would be the...
[00:14:37.645 --> 00:14:41.072]  The miscarriages around the house or the yard, you don't really want that.
[00:14:41.112 --> 00:14:42.174]  We just do that to humans.
[00:14:43.715 --> 00:14:47.436]  And it says the alternative, surgically removing the testicles, guarantees sterility.
[00:14:47.496 --> 00:14:51.477]  In a study of 224 dogs, Nutrasol did almost as well.
[00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:58.898]  Semen analysis showed only one sterilization failure, said Dr. Madeline Burson of the Food and Drug Administration.
[00:14:58.918 --> 00:15:03.159]  The FDA approved Nutrasol in March, but did not announce the approval until Monday.
[00:15:03.219 --> 00:15:06.620]  Again, the stuff I saw in Dog Fancy was the hormone sterilization system.
[00:15:07.398 --> 00:15:10.761]  A type of chemical castration already is available for humans.
[00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:17.907]  Sex offenders often are sentenced to regular injections of hormones to deplete testosterone, but that's not permanent sterilization.
[00:15:18.467 --> 00:15:25.393]  The new method for dogs is permanent, but some testosterone production continues because it's not hormonally driven.
[00:15:25.813 --> 00:15:34.160]  Burson said, so unlike surgically castration, Nucrosol may not eliminate unwanted male behavior such as roaming, marking, and aggression, the FDA warned.
[00:15:36.804 --> 00:15:42.699]  Now, understand, the UN was caught two years ago in Peru engaging in forced castrations.
[00:15:42.719 --> 00:15:45.747]  They still do the castration instead of just cutting the tubes.
[00:15:46.944 --> 00:15:48.084]  Hundreds of thousands of men.
[00:15:48.104 --> 00:15:49.965]  The government will just round them up and do it.
[00:15:50.405 --> 00:15:51.125]  They do it to women.
[00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:53.446]  They've been caught over the last couple decades.
[00:15:53.466 --> 00:16:00.487]  The UN has paid for tens of millions of women and men to be forcibly sterilized in India.
[00:16:00.828 --> 00:16:01.808]  China does this.
[00:16:01.868 --> 00:16:07.929]  China kills out-of-the-womb living born babies, not just killing fetuses or babies in the womb.
[00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.790]  And they are the model of the world.
[00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.110]  They get all the big awards.
[00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:14.191]  And, by the way...
[00:16:16.298 --> 00:16:19.399]  There's a big move globally for a one-child policy.
[00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:28.403]  And you look at all the loss and fertility and other factors, much of that is the garbage and the food, the genetically engineered trash, fluoride, the chlorine in the water.
[00:16:29.204 --> 00:16:41.888]  The dioxin from all plastics manufacturing in any plastic bag that your child's eating, a honey bun or something out of, or those hot dogs you put in the microwave.
[00:16:41.928 --> 00:16:43.288]  There's massive estrogen.
[00:16:43.828 --> 00:16:46.649]  That's why your boys will grow breasts.
[00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:49.910]  That's why your young girls at eight years old now are going into puberty.
[00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.591]  It's killing us.
[00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:54.191]  This is the real environmental crisis.
[00:16:54.411 --> 00:16:55.992]  Nothing's being done to address it.
[00:16:56.801 --> 00:16:56.921]  Autism.
[00:17:24.662 --> 00:17:36.053]  And the American study published in the medical journal International Pediatrics added that there was also a marked increase in other neurological disorders such as brain damage and mental retardation in children who received the MMR vaccine.
[00:17:36.933 --> 00:17:39.196]  And they say as opposed to the DTP jag.
[00:17:39.576 --> 00:17:42.218]  Now they say give the shots individually.
[00:17:42.278 --> 00:17:43.359]  That's a shill story.
[00:17:43.419 --> 00:17:45.061]  Like, oh, it's the MMR that's bad.
[00:17:45.381 --> 00:17:46.482]  Take your shots individually.
[00:17:46.502 --> 00:17:47.203]  You'll be okay.
[00:17:48.436 --> 00:17:54.078]  This government admittedly has sprayed our troops thousands of times with deadly biologicals.
[00:17:54.118 --> 00:17:56.118]  They've sprayed almost every major state and city.
[00:17:57.018 --> 00:17:58.299]  Admitted mainstream news.
[00:17:58.699 --> 00:17:59.839]  It's all in my new film.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.620]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.260]  We have their documents.
[00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:07.221]  This is admitted eugenics attack on you.
[00:18:07.361 --> 00:18:09.362]  We are under attack, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:09.802]  Repeat.
[00:18:10.162 --> 00:18:13.023]  We are under massive, unprecedented attack.
[00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:23.137]  This government, this global government, is so criminally insane, so ruthless, so wicked, they practice darkness like a doctor practices medicine.
[00:18:25.017 --> 00:18:33.420]  And now under Bush's new initiative, they will have $10 million a year to forcibly inject you with dozens of different pathogens to protect you from the bio-threat.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.861]  There's going to be lots of bio-scares as they...
[00:18:36.528 --> 00:18:43.816]  Concentrically lock us down in our cities, drive us off the rural areas into the control grid so they can have our way with us.
[00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:48.280]  Humanity is under unprecedented Nazi attack.
[00:18:48.821 --> 00:18:55.087]  Eugenics, Malthusian social Darwinists are in control.
[00:18:55.227 --> 00:18:56.248]  We must resist.
[00:18:56.288 --> 00:18:57.630]  We must fight the New World Order.
[00:18:58.883 --> 00:19:06.709]  I'm going to take calls early in the hour because we've got a guest joining us from the United Kingdom who runs Bilderberg.org, an expert on the New World Order.
[00:19:06.749 --> 00:19:13.394]  Tomorrow we've got Big Jim Tucker, formerly with the Spotlight, now American Free Press, joining us to talk about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:19:14.495 --> 00:19:15.296]  That's coming up.
[00:19:16.276 --> 00:19:17.397]  You don't want to miss that.
[00:19:17.697 --> 00:19:21.020]  And I'm working on getting Michael Haga on the show, the international...
[00:19:22.206 --> 00:19:29.691]  We'll take calls early in this hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:29.831 --> 00:19:38.857]  I'm glad no one was hurt in the blast at the Yale Law School.
[00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:40.398]  What a convenient activity.
[00:19:40.418 --> 00:19:42.079]  I wonder if Scullum Bones was involved.
[00:19:42.659 --> 00:19:48.943]  You know, the Carlaw Group formerly owned the company, and it was still a CIA front, the stuff that got bombed over in Saudi Arabia.
[00:19:49.644 --> 00:19:51.005]  Who stands to gain from this?
[00:19:51.872 --> 00:19:52.492]  We have a U.S.
[00:19:52.512 --> 00:19:57.614]  government document called Northwoods where they tell us they want to carry out bombings to scare the public into submission.
[00:19:57.634 --> 00:20:01.116]  So I look to those that have confessed to what they're doing.
[00:20:01.896 --> 00:20:03.417]  Yes, I look at a confession.
[00:20:03.857 --> 00:20:04.857]  A public confession.
[00:20:05.178 --> 00:20:06.218]  And that's my suspect.
[00:20:06.558 --> 00:20:07.479]  Ooh, how radical.
[00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:08.219]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:10.712 --> 00:20:13.834]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[00:20:14.294 --> 00:20:16.315]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:19.256]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:24.178]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[00:20:24.378 --> 00:20:26.139]  But you have to act now!
[00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:32.542]  With $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I've seen in my 24 years in the business.
[00:20:32.942 --> 00:20:39.466]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:43.248]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[00:20:43.488 --> 00:20:46.930]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.652]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[00:20:50.012 --> 00:20:50.832]  Do it now.
[00:20:51.073 --> 00:21:00.458]  That's $10 collector gold coins, $10 and $20 collector gold coins, at the nearest of melt in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[00:21:00.776 --> 00:21:01.498]  800-686-2237 That's Midas at 800-686-2237
[00:21:09.634 --> 00:21:10.214]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:10.234 --> 00:21:11.235]  This is Alex Jones.

[00:21:17.598 --> 00:21:22.720]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:32.385]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:21:32.705 --> 00:21:37.647]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:21:37.967 --> 00:21:41.969]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:46.931]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:21:47.311 --> 00:21:53.193]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.780]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:09.625 --> 00:22:13.287]  How many of you listening would give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[00:22:13.807 --> 00:22:14.647]  Listen up, folks.
[00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:18.169]  If you're taking vitamins in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:22:18.569 --> 00:22:23.951]  You see, according to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are just 10% absorbed.
[00:22:24.291 --> 00:22:28.914]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, you're literally flushing $90 down the toilet.
[00:22:30.174 --> 00:22:36.398]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, and if you want to start absorbing the nutrients that you swallow, you need to take sea silver.
[00:22:36.859 --> 00:22:45.684]  Not only does it contain every vitamin, mineral, amino acid, and enzyme known to man, but because it's in an organic liquid form, it offers a 98% absorption.
[00:22:45.985 --> 00:22:49.187]  And what that means is your body gets to keep the nutrients that you swallow.

[00:22:59.654 --> 00:23:09.022]  Isn't it time you stopped flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[00:23:09.042 --> 00:23:09.922]  1-888-887-2063.
[00:23:10.423 --> 00:23:13.666]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a road map?
[00:23:13.866 --> 00:23:15.287]  And how easy it would be to get lost?
[00:23:15.607 --> 00:23:16.968]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[00:23:17.008 --> 00:23:19.330]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[00:23:19.771 --> 00:23:22.613]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[00:23:22.653 --> 00:23:23.013]  coins.
[00:23:23.253 --> 00:23:24.514]  The Red Book Guide to U.S.
[00:23:24.554 --> 00:23:30.099]  Coins and History provides you with the knowledge you'll need to make informed decisions when it comes to collecting and investing in U.S.
[00:23:30.139 --> 00:23:31.100]  gold and silver coins.

[00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:55.293]  Coins.
[00:23:55.313 --> 00:23:56.373]  Get the 2003 edition today.
[00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:56.553]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.552]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:24:23.752 --> 00:24:24.793]  Back live.
[00:24:25.573 --> 00:24:41.481]  You've got social engineers who just so happen to be criminally insane control freaks who are sadistic, who publicly say in their own reports, their own policy papers, that their main goal is to sterilize you to reduce world population by 80 to 95 percent.
[00:24:42.742 --> 00:24:47.244]  And it's not just Prince Philip and Ted Turner and Jacques Cousteau who make these type of comments.
[00:24:47.324 --> 00:24:47.625]  It's the U.N.,
[00:24:49.995 --> 00:24:50.916]  It's our own government.
[00:24:51.636 --> 00:24:52.777]  It's what they push for.
[00:24:53.698 --> 00:25:05.587]  This is a real discussion that people are not having that they should be having, and we have a government that's been caught doing all these horrible tests on us in the last hundred years right through to this year, telling us, oh, take your shots.
[00:25:05.607 --> 00:25:06.488]  It needs to be the law.
[00:25:06.528 --> 00:25:07.989]  We've got lots of shots for you.
[00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:09.470]  Oh, you don't want to take your shots?
[00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.212]  We'll just engineer it into the food.
[00:25:11.652 --> 00:25:12.653]  How does that sound?
[00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:16.863]  Meanwhile, blast hits Istanbul restaurant.
[00:25:17.163 --> 00:25:22.528]  See all these little bombings happening all over the place, getting the world behind the New World Order takeover?
[00:25:23.048 --> 00:25:28.773]  Explosion has rocked a restaurant in Istanbul, the capital of Turkey, or near the capital of Turkey, injuring at least two people.
[00:25:28.813 --> 00:25:32.736]  It was reported today it was not immediately clear what caused the explosion.
[00:25:32.776 --> 00:25:40.602]  CNN Turk said two people were injured, and investigators were looking into whether a cooking gas canister caused the blast.
[00:25:41.747 --> 00:25:43.608]  Yeah, there are natural gas explosions.
[00:25:43.668 --> 00:25:44.909]  Are these real terrorist attacks?
[00:25:45.009 --> 00:25:51.572]  The MTV television channel said at least six people have been pulled from the rubble at the site of the explosion.
[00:25:51.592 --> 00:25:53.253]  It was not clear if others remained trapped.
[00:25:53.293 --> 00:26:01.918]  Police were unable to confirm there had been an explosion in the district and upmarket neighborhood dotted with cafes and hotels not far from Istanbul.
[00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:02.258]  Scenic.
[00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:14.554]  Bosphorus Straits, the Reuters News Agency reported, bomb detonated in Anikar Cafe on Tuesday, killing a far-left suicide bomber and injuring one other person.
[00:26:15.074 --> 00:26:17.515]  Far-left suicide bomber?
[00:26:18.175 --> 00:26:20.716]  Now, is Al-Qaeda far-left or they were far-right?
[00:26:21.557 --> 00:26:24.898]  And, again, are these people being given packages?
[00:26:25.258 --> 00:26:26.138]  That's happened before.
[00:26:26.758 --> 00:26:32.140]  Again, we know the CIA had the right wing carry out and funded terrorist attacks in Italy in the 70s and 80s.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.760]  They blame on the left wing.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.521]  Again, whoever gets out of line, gets bombings, blamed on them.
[00:26:38.341 --> 00:26:40.642]  FBI quizzes Yale students.
[00:26:40.742 --> 00:26:46.543]  FBI agents are questioning students at the prestigious Yale University Law School after an explosion in an empty classroom.
[00:26:48.047 --> 00:26:52.790]  The blast at one of America's top universities caused some damage, but no injuries according to officials there.
[00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.152]  FBI Special Agent Mike Wolf said an explosive device had gone off.
[00:26:56.612 --> 00:27:01.355]  The explosion, which knocked out a wall between two rooms, came a day after the U.S.
[00:27:01.395 --> 00:27:06.017]  government raised its terror alert status due to a renewed risk of terrorist attacks.
[00:27:06.618 --> 00:27:10.660]  Members of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force are investigating according to government officials in Washington.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.262]  President George W. Bush granted and graduated from Yale.
[00:27:15.123 --> 00:27:19.125]  And his daughter, Barbara, currently attends university as an undergraduate student.
[00:27:19.145 --> 00:27:21.446]  Yeah, she'll be a skull and bones member by junior high.
[00:27:22.566 --> 00:27:25.227]  She was not on campus at the time of the blast.
[00:27:25.287 --> 00:27:28.869]  University is currently holding an end-of-term exams, and many of the students are elsewhere.
[00:27:28.889 --> 00:27:35.252]  Yale said in a statement the explosion caused considerable damage to the classroom and to adjacent lounge.
[00:27:35.612 --> 00:27:40.314]  Jennifer Springling, a first-year student from Arlington, Virginia, said she was...
[00:27:40.834 --> 00:27:45.940]  Pete pleading a day-long exam when she heard a really loud boom from a room on the same floor.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.663]  She said, My heart started pounding.
[00:27:47.743 --> 00:27:48.604]  I was hyperventilating.
[00:27:48.884 --> 00:27:50.887]  The people started yelling to get out of the building.
[00:27:51.187 --> 00:27:56.674]  Mike Pyle, a second-year law student, said he was among a few dozen people in the law school building when the blast occurred.
[00:27:57.814 --> 00:28:00.896]  So that's the situation there right now.
[00:28:00.936 --> 00:28:02.818]  What do you think about all these convenient bombings?
[00:28:02.838 --> 00:28:03.839]  Who do you think's behind it?
[00:28:03.879 --> 00:28:04.659]  Who has the motive?
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:10.163]  Nice diversion from Bush's war record of being AWOL from the Texas National Guard.
[00:28:10.224 --> 00:28:11.324]  Nice smokescreen for that.
[00:28:11.665 --> 00:28:14.547]  Nice smokescreen for the bids not being allowed to be taken.
[00:28:16.239 --> 00:28:21.660]  With Halliburton, nice smoke screen from the cholera spreading all over Iraq and the total breakdown of services.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.041]  Nice smoke screen for the plunging dollar that our government's bad-mouthing.
[00:28:25.541 --> 00:28:29.261]  Nice smoke screen for the troops on the streets training us to accept a police state.
[00:28:30.162 --> 00:28:30.982]  What do you think about that?
[00:28:31.002 --> 00:28:34.122]  What do you think about Mad Cow in Canada?
[00:28:34.142 --> 00:28:36.283]  We know it's been in North America for a while.
[00:28:36.943 --> 00:28:41.004]  We know they feed blood and other tissue products to...
[00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:47.654]  Herbivores, animals that don't eat meat, much less rotten meat.
[00:28:48.254 --> 00:28:51.415]  World shuns Canadian beef over mad cow fears.
[00:28:52.135 --> 00:28:53.395]  Where do you think those will end?
[00:28:53.415 --> 00:28:57.136]  You know they've carried out a lot of cover-ups here in Austin.
[00:28:57.156 --> 00:29:02.577]  I've seen the forms signed by doctors that mad cow in humans has killed people.
[00:29:02.717 --> 00:29:03.557]  I've seen it.
[00:29:04.037 --> 00:29:05.197]  No one will cover it in the news.
[00:29:05.237 --> 00:29:06.157]  What's really going on?
[00:29:06.557 --> 00:29:08.938]  World shuns Canadian beef over mad cow fears.
[00:29:10.126 --> 00:29:21.398]  The world slammed the door on Canadian beef and cattle Wednesday fearing a mad cow disease outbreak as inspectors sealed off more farms while racing to trace the origin of the animal confirmed as the country's first case in a decade.
[00:29:21.418 --> 00:29:22.980]  Do you really believe that?
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.902]  Why did this story come out now?
[00:29:26.517 --> 00:29:28.738]  Do you know what they'll do under a mad cow breakout?
[00:29:28.858 --> 00:29:30.839]  Or do you know what they'll do under a foot-and-mouth breakout?
[00:29:30.879 --> 00:29:32.920]  They'll lock down all the farms nationwide.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.860]  It's a federal plan.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.920]  And kill your animals.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.862]  And the Army will, quote, deliver food to your farm or ranch, if you really believe that.
[00:29:40.723 --> 00:29:44.124]  That was in the Pioneer Press last year, two years ago, out of Minnesota.
[00:29:44.164 --> 00:29:45.365]  They set up martial law.
[00:29:45.385 --> 00:29:45.965]  That happens.
[00:29:46.585 --> 00:29:48.066]  What do you think about these issues?
[00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:51.528]  1-800-259-9231 Your calls when we get back at 800-259-9231 Stay with me.
[00:29:51.608 --> 00:29:52.348]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.368 --> 00:29:53.469]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.529 --> 00:29:54.590]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:16.721]  Some people believe a group of wealthy men control political parties, the American media, and the wealth of our nation.
[00:30:17.161 --> 00:30:17.862]  Is this true?
[00:30:18.422 --> 00:30:21.262]  Dr. Stanley Monteith spent 40 years studying years.
[00:30:21.282 --> 00:30:21.302]  803-4438.
[00:30:21.342 --> 00:30:22.403]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:30:42.277 --> 00:30:49.022]  It's 33 minutes and 14 seconds into this hour, into this first hour.
[00:30:49.102 --> 00:30:51.243]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:30:52.644 --> 00:30:55.146]  And your calls are coming up here momentarily.
[00:30:55.166 --> 00:31:02.491]  We do have a guest joining us from the United Kingdom, who's an expert on the Bilderberg Group, been tracking it for years, has the website Bilderberg.org.
[00:31:03.572 --> 00:31:07.634]  We have a link to it on Infowars.com, being updated right now.
[00:31:08.455 --> 00:31:09.996]  And tomorrow I do have Big Jim Tucker...
[00:31:10.655 --> 00:31:13.859]  Jim Tucker from American Free Press joining us to talk about the Billerberg Group.
[00:31:13.879 --> 00:31:17.704]  I guess it was the 26th time he has covered the group.
[00:31:18.685 --> 00:31:21.729]  In country, over there where the bosses lie, we had...
[00:31:23.587 --> 00:31:27.651]  Well, Rumsfeld and Richard Pearl over there getting their orders from their bosses in Europe.
[00:31:27.691 --> 00:31:28.572]  It's totally staged.
[00:31:28.592 --> 00:31:29.693]  There's no fight between the U.S.
[00:31:29.733 --> 00:31:30.073]  and Europe.
[00:31:30.454 --> 00:31:35.258]  Europe owns our central banks and has ordered the death of the dollar, which is now taking place.
[00:31:35.338 --> 00:31:36.499]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:31:36.539 --> 00:31:42.245]  And a lot of the other news I haven't gotten to yet, but we're about to go straight to your calls.
[00:31:42.365 --> 00:31:43.446]  Before I do that,
[00:31:46.861 --> 00:31:48.882]  I want to plug my videos.
[00:31:48.942 --> 00:31:50.323]  They are excellent films.
[00:31:50.363 --> 00:31:51.744]  They are full-length features.
[00:31:51.784 --> 00:31:53.365]  That means over two hours long.
[00:31:53.786 --> 00:31:54.986]  Professionally produced.
[00:31:55.087 --> 00:32:00.030]  I have now made my ninth film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.012]  The greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us.
[00:32:03.112 --> 00:32:07.695]  A scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn to enslave every man, woman, and child.
[00:32:08.155 --> 00:32:08.996]  We're good to go.
[00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:39.079]  Takeover, the current Takeover, the true character of the globalist, learned the master plan of the bloodthirsty elite to financially, physically, and spiritually imprison not only America but the world.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:45.562]  Total enslavement is the third installment in my critically acclaimed Police State series and is a must-see for all who love freedom.
[00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:48.944]  This film documents the nightmare rise of the Homeland Security dictatorship.
[00:32:49.304 --> 00:32:57.766]  Patriot Act 1 and 2, the Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison death surveillance economy, and much more.
[00:32:58.266 --> 00:33:07.389]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism and how the globalists pose as our saviors when, in fact, they are the terrorists.
[00:33:08.689 --> 00:33:14.731]  Of course, there's Police State 2000, the first film with the Marines trying to take your guns and put you in camps.
[00:33:16.081 --> 00:33:18.005]  The black helicopters attacking South Texas.
[00:33:18.065 --> 00:33:21.071]  Police chiefs and mayors and city managers speaking out.
[00:33:23.092 --> 00:33:24.093]  It goes on and on.
[00:33:24.573 --> 00:33:34.021]  We have the takeover, government hired provocateurs to cause riots during protests, training the children that the schools are prisons, the FEMA camps, and much more.
[00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:36.963]  And now we have Police State 3 total enslavement.
[00:33:37.564 --> 00:33:52.456]  They're $25.95 apiece, but if you order three or more of any of the nine films, they drop down to $20, and you're authorized and encouraged to make copies of my videos and spread the word for nonprofit educational not-for-sale purposes.
[00:33:53.869 --> 00:33:55.170]  So I have nine films.
[00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:59.474]  Of course, I have 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, about September 11th.
[00:33:59.514 --> 00:34:01.616]  I have my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:34:01.636 --> 00:34:03.438]  It's 230 pages, only $12.
[00:34:04.719 --> 00:34:18.050]  Go to InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net or PrisonPlanet.com to order the films via our secure online shopping cart or call toll-free right now to get the videos and start Wicked America up to the reality at 1-888-
[00:34:19.872 --> 00:34:23.914]  1-888-253-3139 as we attempt and are very successful at freeing minds.
[00:34:23.934 --> 00:34:29.438]  1-888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:34:46.374 --> 00:34:51.596]  All right, let's talk to Curtis in Louisiana, then Kevin in Pennsylvania, Ken in Virginia, and others.
[00:34:52.136 --> 00:34:53.096]  Curtis, you're on the air.
[00:34:53.136 --> 00:34:53.736]  Welcome, sir.
[00:34:54.836 --> 00:34:55.437]  How you doing?
[00:34:55.697 --> 00:34:55.957]  Good.
[00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:59.258]  I wanted to let you know about a website.
[00:34:59.598 --> 00:35:14.422]  It's called truthteller.org, and what it has on it, it's an article about Israel, and it's basically explaining why all the terror all over the world in the Middle East is going on, and it just basically says that
[00:35:15.737 --> 00:35:21.236]  The Jews are going to be scattered and persecuted around the world if they don't turn back to God and have
[00:35:23.611 --> 00:35:31.115]  Well, let me just say this.
[00:35:31.256 --> 00:35:40.901]  I wouldn't say the Jews, but definitely the people running Israel are part of the New World Order, just like those running France or Germany or England or this country are.
[00:35:41.502 --> 00:35:42.662]  And it's not Alex Jones.
[00:35:42.722 --> 00:35:43.443]  It's Haratz.
[00:35:43.723 --> 00:35:46.044]  It's the Jerusalem Post.
[00:35:46.565 --> 00:35:48.186]  It's United Press International.
[00:35:48.926 --> 00:35:50.187]  It's Media Bypass.
[00:35:50.247 --> 00:35:51.668]  It's all in the new film, by the way.
[00:35:52.821 --> 00:35:55.684]  The Police State 3, we have a section on Israel.
[00:35:56.845 --> 00:36:00.928]  They admit they founded and funded Hamas to create the crisis.
[00:36:00.988 --> 00:36:07.393]  Every time it looks like Sharon's going to have to sign a peace deal, bombings take place that keep this whole thing going.
[00:36:08.774 --> 00:36:11.436]  And this is the reality, this is the facts.
[00:36:11.476 --> 00:36:13.017]  Yusak Rabin told us about this.
[00:36:13.558 --> 00:36:18.722]  Why is it that the Bible says that when Israel turns away from God and becomes secular...
[00:36:19.514 --> 00:36:22.296]  They go into bondage, they go into captivity, they get scattered.
[00:36:22.736 --> 00:36:26.358]  But today the 501c3 controlled churches won't say that.
[00:36:26.939 --> 00:36:32.662]  They say that's not true when the Bible is clear on that and what you just said is absolutely on target.
[00:36:32.702 --> 00:36:44.850]  Look at all the prophets and what happened over and over again in Israel and it's definitely happening again and it's very, very sad.
[00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:45.190]  Go ahead.
[00:36:45.925 --> 00:36:46.485]  Exactly.
[00:36:46.585 --> 00:36:55.891]  Maybe when Colin Powell does his Roadmap to Peace in the Middle East, maybe he needs to take these articles of the Bible and read it to them.
[00:36:57.292 --> 00:37:01.414]  I don't know what they're doing over there, but I just wanted to let you know about that website.
[00:37:01.454 --> 00:37:02.875]  I didn't know you had that in your film.
[00:37:02.935 --> 00:37:04.196]  I plan on getting one tomorrow.
[00:37:05.016 --> 00:37:06.057]  They all sound exciting.
[00:37:06.097 --> 00:37:07.498]  I don't know which one I should get first.
[00:37:07.918 --> 00:37:10.539]  If you're getting one video, I'd get Road to Charity.
[00:37:10.919 --> 00:37:11.240]  Okay.
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.902]  Yeah, I'm going to get them until I get them all, but I just wanted to...
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:22.005]  You know, let the listeners know about that website, and they can go there and buy the videos and read the article.
[00:37:22.025 --> 00:37:22.445]  Okay.
[00:37:22.465 --> 00:37:23.066]  Yeah.
[00:37:24.467 --> 00:37:24.747]  All right.
[00:37:24.787 --> 00:37:25.588]  Well, thanks for the call.
[00:37:25.628 --> 00:37:27.029]  I appreciate it, Curtis.
[00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.051]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Pennsylvania.
[00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:30.912]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[00:37:30.952 --> 00:37:31.272]  Welcome.
[00:37:32.453 --> 00:37:32.773]  Hello?
[00:37:33.054 --> 00:37:33.434]  Yes, sir.
[00:37:34.115 --> 00:37:38.538]  I just wanted to tell you, like, what I do, so, like, if other people are listening, they'll do the same.
[00:37:39.219 --> 00:37:44.803]  Like, I make, like, books with news stories, and I pass them all out, and I pass out your movies.
[00:37:45.626 --> 00:37:47.087]  And 9-1-1's the best one.
[00:37:47.107 --> 00:37:47.747]  That's amazing.
[00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:54.491]  We're getting 90% wake-up with Road to Charity with people.
[00:37:55.212 --> 00:38:04.877]  Yeah, I get a lot of people who, yeah, they wake up and stuff, but some of my friends, if they even start talking to me about it, like their girlfriends or wives, give them a look.
[00:38:05.698 --> 00:38:06.838]  They're not allowed to talk to me.
[00:38:07.499 --> 00:38:09.320]  Most of my friends don't even talk to me anymore.
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.242]  But we had the primaries just a couple days ago.
[00:38:13.737 --> 00:38:16.620]  And I went to, like, all the election places, and I passed out, like, books.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.382]  I probably passed out, like, 50 movies.
[00:38:19.823 --> 00:38:22.385]  And, I don't know, that's just what people got to do.
[00:38:23.186 --> 00:38:26.890]  But, yeah, I'm going to just start making flyers, just like one or two pages.
[00:38:27.509 --> 00:38:30.650]  Just make thousands and just go pass them around at the parking lot.
[00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:31.850]  Well, we've got to do it.
[00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:35.131]  Look, if we don't do it, the globalists are going to keep carrying out terror.
[00:38:35.391 --> 00:38:37.411]  They're going to accelerate this takeover.
[00:38:37.771 --> 00:38:42.092]  They're going to get away with what they're doing and keep posing as our saviors while they're the terrorists.
[00:38:42.132 --> 00:38:45.033]  We have got to do this or America is going to die.
[00:38:45.093 --> 00:38:46.033]  America is dying.
[00:38:46.413 --> 00:38:49.134]  Our sovereignty, our dollar, everything is imploding.
[00:38:49.474 --> 00:38:55.855]  Right now, by design, we have their own policy papers, their own plans that are public, and now they're doing it.
[00:38:56.451 --> 00:38:56.931]  Yeah, I know.
[00:38:57.171 --> 00:38:58.032]  It's just so hard.
[00:38:58.152 --> 00:39:06.094]  I carry around the side of an organic milk carton, and I show my friends and people what's in the milk, and they tell me I'm crazy.
[00:39:06.134 --> 00:39:08.635]  They say, who cares if you drink this stuff?
[00:39:08.715 --> 00:39:10.315]  People are just so far gone.
[00:39:10.335 --> 00:39:12.436]  I don't know.
[00:39:13.081 --> 00:39:15.322]  It seems, like, helpless sometimes, or useless.
[00:39:15.422 --> 00:39:19.485]  And you're a weirdo because you want to warn people about corruption.
[00:39:19.525 --> 00:39:20.985]  You want to be involved in your community.
[00:39:21.145 --> 00:39:24.527]  They're good because all they do is watch football and drink beer.
[00:39:24.847 --> 00:39:25.068]  Oh, yeah.
[00:39:25.128 --> 00:39:27.129]  Well, yeah, my little nephew, he's, like, 12.
[00:39:27.669 --> 00:39:28.569]  I tell him stuff.
[00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:31.891]  And, like, my whole rest of my family says, don't talk to him.
[00:39:31.931 --> 00:39:32.371]  He's nuts.
[00:39:32.772 --> 00:39:33.612]  He knows I'm right.
[00:39:33.932 --> 00:39:34.913]  Well, let me just say this.
[00:39:36.388 --> 00:39:39.572]  You know, I get some calls where 100% of people are waking up.
[00:39:39.672 --> 00:39:40.493]  Most calls, they say 90%.
[00:39:41.194 --> 00:39:44.799]  Then I get these calls where most people say, get away from me, I don't want to hear it.
[00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:47.422]  And areas like Pennsylvania do seem to be worse.
[00:39:47.442 --> 00:39:48.844]  We get a lot of that from Pennsylvania.
[00:39:49.805 --> 00:39:52.226]  Uh, but a lot of times family won't listen.
[00:39:52.246 --> 00:39:54.347]  They don't respect you, they don't respect themselves.
[00:39:54.587 --> 00:39:54.847]  Yeah.
[00:39:54.908 --> 00:39:58.349]  They think that when you're warning them, you're trying to talk down to them.
[00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:00.890]  You ever heard that a prophet isn't recognized in his own country?
[00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.191]  Oh, that's all, I hear that all the time.
[00:40:03.431 --> 00:40:06.673]  Yeah, what, what, I mean, are you getting any good responses from people?
[00:40:06.893 --> 00:40:09.114]  Oh, yeah, I get, I get, yeah, I get some.
[00:40:09.554 --> 00:40:13.076]  I had, uh, I had some old guy I worked with the other day.
[00:40:13.276 --> 00:40:14.757]  Oh, he's not old, he's like 40-something.
[00:40:15.197 --> 00:40:15.517]  He, uh...
[00:40:16.044 --> 00:40:18.186]  He was like almost crying to me the other day.
[00:40:18.206 --> 00:40:20.128]  He's like, when do you think all this is going to happen?
[00:40:20.628 --> 00:40:26.734]  And, you know, I almost think it's a joke because I've been telling people for like seven, eight years what's going to be happening.
[00:40:27.375 --> 00:40:29.857]  And, you know, now it's really here.
[00:40:31.161 --> 00:40:35.262]  A lot of them heard it but made a split-second decision because they're afraid of the system.
[00:40:35.282 --> 00:40:39.763]  It's just to deny it exists, to hope it goes away, to bury it psychologically.
[00:40:39.803 --> 00:40:44.384]  But as things get worse, they're going to remember what you said and the seeds you planted.
[00:40:44.744 --> 00:40:47.364]  Not every seed sprouts the first year.
[00:40:47.384 --> 00:40:48.785]  It's just they're dormant.
[00:40:49.425 --> 00:40:50.425]  I email stories.
[00:40:50.465 --> 00:40:56.546]  Like when people send me them stupid emails with, like, you know, it's forwarded a thousand times, I still follow them emails.
[00:40:56.706 --> 00:40:59.467]  I email, like, Post Gazette and Trib stories.
[00:41:00.387 --> 00:41:02.969]  And there's links with your movie on there.
[00:41:03.029 --> 00:41:04.350]  I emailed that to people.
[00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:08.913]  I probably emailed like thousands, and I probably got back like 20 responses.
[00:41:09.374 --> 00:41:18.580]  I got like five thank yous, and most people tell me I'm crazy or where did you get my email from, and I just keep emailing them back.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.241]  All right, sir.
[00:41:19.281 --> 00:41:20.401]  I appreciate the call.
[00:41:20.602 --> 00:41:23.764]  Yeah, he's one of those weirdos that thinks the world is round.
[00:41:24.907 --> 00:41:27.810]  And they all say it's flat, but one day they're going to admit it's round.
[00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:31.933]  It was 3%, 2% at the start of the revolution, 5% that won it.
[00:41:31.973 --> 00:41:33.534]  We're not revolutionaries this time.
[00:41:33.895 --> 00:41:35.096]  We're restorationists.
[00:41:35.496 --> 00:41:36.897]  We want our country back.
[00:41:36.937 --> 00:41:38.538]  We're going to get our country back.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.322]  But I've got to tell you, I've done over 800 radio interviews.
[00:41:44.724 --> 00:41:49.928]  This morning I was on Man Cow, the number one talk show in the morning in Chicago.
[00:41:52.111 --> 00:42:05.538]  And I'm on his show, and he said, Alex, I've got to tell you, you were on this show a year ago, and you said that you had video Marines training with role players screaming, I'm an American, please know, not the camp.
[00:42:05.558 --> 00:42:20.605]  And he said, I want to tell you, in Operation Top Off 2 they just did in Chicago, they had police with role players simulating hitting Americans in the face with rifle butts as they beg, I'm an American, please know, not the camp.
[00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:25.758]  And he just came right out and said, I've got to agree with you about the government carrying out the attacks.
[00:42:25.798 --> 00:42:28.781]  He said, I've got to agree with you about the police state.
[00:42:28.801 --> 00:42:41.831]  He says, I'm at the airport flying around the country, and I see 10-year-old girls being harassed by illegal aliens who are the security people confiscating their Hello Kitty toothbrushes.
[00:42:42.252 --> 00:42:45.134]  Meanwhile, people with giant turbans walk right through.
[00:42:46.055 --> 00:42:48.637]  It's all about training you to live in a police state.
[00:42:49.136 --> 00:42:58.400]  And then as the alerts expand, the troops are on the bridges, they're on the buses, they're on the streets, the helicopters are in the air, the drones are in the air, more and more and more.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:09.444]  But here I am, you know, on this show, Man Cal, number one show in Chicago, and here is his three co-hosts, you know, his sidekicks, all agreeing with me.
[00:43:10.965 --> 00:43:15.527]  Here I am doing these interviews on Pacifica, Liberal Radio, Conservative Radio.
[00:43:16.208 --> 00:43:17.288]  I've done it all, folks.
[00:43:17.488 --> 00:43:20.370]  And one out of 30 callers might call and disagree.
[00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:21.370]  But I'm bold.
[00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:22.331]  I've got my facts.
[00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:23.732]  I'm not apologetic about it.
[00:43:24.292 --> 00:43:28.014]  Five, six years ago, I'd be, I know this sounds crazy, but there's a world government.
[00:43:28.574 --> 00:43:31.556]  You don't start, you say, hey, I've got a warning for you.
[00:43:31.836 --> 00:43:32.676]  You know about history.
[00:43:32.696 --> 00:43:34.337]  You know about all the tyrants in history, right?
[00:43:34.757 --> 00:43:35.878]  Well, it's repeating itself.
[00:43:36.713 --> 00:43:37.854]  Government wants more power.
[00:43:37.894 --> 00:43:39.236]  You know that's historical, right?
[00:43:39.296 --> 00:43:39.896]  Yes, I do.
[00:43:40.437 --> 00:43:41.718]  Well, let me tell you about this.
[00:43:42.238 --> 00:43:42.979]  Please watch this.
[00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:43.620]  It's important.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.961]  They're going to take your pension fund.
[00:43:45.402 --> 00:43:47.383]  They're going to drive down the stock market.
[00:43:47.403 --> 00:43:48.625]  They're going to devalue the dollar.
[00:43:48.665 --> 00:43:49.425]  Here's their plan.
[00:43:49.786 --> 00:43:50.847]  Here's a film about it.
[00:43:52.328 --> 00:43:58.074]  And if you're in command, if you're serious, if you're focused, they will listen.
[00:43:59.611 --> 00:44:01.052]  Don't waste your time with your family.
[00:44:01.092 --> 00:44:02.032]  They generally won't listen.
[00:44:02.052 --> 00:44:02.812]  They don't respect you.
[00:44:03.353 --> 00:44:03.813]  Move out.
[00:44:03.933 --> 00:44:04.973]  Find those that do care.
[00:44:05.314 --> 00:44:13.737]  Get involved in organizations pro-rights, organizations pro-gun groups, pro-land groups, sovereignty groups, anti-illegal immigration groups.
[00:44:13.777 --> 00:44:14.538]  Go into those groups.
[00:44:14.678 --> 00:44:15.778]  Educate those activists.
[00:44:16.198 --> 00:44:17.319]  That's what you need to target.
[00:44:17.879 --> 00:44:19.220]  Let's talk to Ken in Virginia.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.040]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:20.480]  Go ahead.
[00:44:23.101 --> 00:44:23.722]  Go ahead, Ken.
[00:44:23.742 --> 00:44:24.262]  You're on the air.
[00:44:25.569 --> 00:44:26.109]  Good morning.
[00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:42.753]  C-SPAN had about a half hour this morning interviews with Tom Kane, Chairman of the National Commission to Investigate Terrorism, and also Lee Hamilton, the Democrat, who's Vice Chairman.
[00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:49.655]  And I was pleasantly surprised by the skepticism and some of the questions that were asked
[00:44:51.797 --> 00:45:01.817]  Tom Kane said that he's aware of at least 500 questions that have been asked, and he says we are hoping to answer every one of them.
[00:45:02.469 --> 00:45:12.673]  Of course, Lee Hamilton said that we've had great cooperation from the executive branch, which we know is not true.
[00:45:12.733 --> 00:45:16.474]  Of course, sir, you're talking about the 9-1-1 whitewash three that's going on.
[00:45:16.494 --> 00:45:18.395]  Now Bush has said no investigation.
[00:45:18.795 --> 00:45:21.396]  Even public hearings are now going to be secret.
[00:45:22.597 --> 00:45:28.701]  Look, they know we're mad about total information awareness, so they change the name and say they're not going to spy on us.
[00:45:29.001 --> 00:45:32.244]  They know we're mad about the TITS program, so they change the name, double the funding.
[00:45:32.644 --> 00:45:34.285]  Of course they're trying to placate you.
[00:45:34.305 --> 00:45:35.526]  They weren't a few months ago.
[00:45:36.347 --> 00:45:39.329]  That shows they know that we know, but here's the problem.
[00:45:39.609 --> 00:45:43.592]  They're allowing us to complain, allowing us to pass laws against the Anti-Patriot Act.
[00:45:44.998 --> 00:45:48.160]  So when they blow something else up, they can go, Oh, see, we told you.
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.101]  Now shut up and don't ask questions.
[00:45:50.421 --> 00:45:58.805]  But there's going to be a minimum, at least, on C-SPAN, which, as I say, there were a number of questions that people turned to C-SPAN.
[00:46:00.066 --> 00:46:08.110]  And a couple of people asked about the Israelis who were seen clapping on the roof at the time of the 9-1-1.
[00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:10.671]  And what happened to them?
[00:46:10.731 --> 00:46:13.853]  They said, well, they would try to find out, maybe.
[00:46:13.873 --> 00:46:23.337]  And they said they upped the appropriation from $3 million to $14 million, which, of course, is much less than... Well, they're running out the clock.
[00:46:23.357 --> 00:46:24.618]  There's less than a year left now.
[00:46:24.678 --> 00:46:27.359]  And many of the people on the committees were involved.
[00:46:27.999 --> 00:46:29.280]  In the whole fiasco.
[00:46:29.901 --> 00:46:36.766]  Yes, one of the callers said I'd feel a lot better if there weren't any people in the government on it.
[00:46:37.286 --> 00:46:40.749]  So there were a number of skeptical questions asked.
[00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:51.458]  I've been sent tapes from C-SPAN Washington Journal where there will be an hour of callers where 9 out of 10 are saying the government did it.
[00:46:52.298 --> 00:46:56.922]  I have videos where they swarm them and Lamb will cut the calls off.
[00:46:58.095 --> 00:46:59.919]  Okay, they had a town hall meeting in Virginia.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.242]  Everybody started saying the government did it.
[00:47:01.623 --> 00:47:03.488]  C-SPAN walked off the stage.
[00:47:03.848 --> 00:47:05.452]  They ended the town hall meeting.
[00:47:05.793 --> 00:47:08.299]  Yeah, they can't keep their illusion going for long.
[00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:09.319]  Right.
[00:47:09.559 --> 00:47:15.441]  When all these couch potatoes see that the cattle are going in the other direction and aren't cattle, they're going to wake up too.
[00:47:16.301 --> 00:47:18.622]  I just thought it was slightly encouraging.
[00:47:18.662 --> 00:47:20.263]  That's what I wanted to pass along.
[00:47:20.823 --> 00:47:24.864]  Let me tell you, Ken, that is very, very encouraging.
[00:47:25.624 --> 00:47:30.486]  What were the politicians' faces like as the people called in saying they weren't buying what was happening?
[00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.533]  Well, frankly, I was moving around.
[00:47:34.553 --> 00:47:46.104]  I wasn't watching their expressions, but, of course, Tom Kane always looked very affable, and he said, well, I'm not part of this.
[00:47:46.224 --> 00:47:49.667]  I was the governor of New Jersey, and I wasn't.
[00:47:51.789 --> 00:47:55.492]  Let me add a caveat to this.
[00:47:55.512 --> 00:48:04.698]  Sure, and in the executive branch of Stonewall, there's been no compliance, and that shows that's a lie.
[00:48:05.218 --> 00:48:05.979]  But here's the deal.
[00:48:06.019 --> 00:48:09.561]  People should ask, why was Bush on the anthrax-fighting antibiotic before 9-1-1?
[00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:12.663]  They should ask, why was Mayor Willie Brown told not to fly?
[00:48:12.903 --> 00:48:14.164]  Why were the hijackers trained at U.S.
[00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:14.544]  bases?
[00:48:14.584 --> 00:48:15.985]  Why are a bunch of them still alive?
[00:48:16.285 --> 00:48:17.606]  Why did the government found al-Qaeda?
[00:48:17.626 --> 00:48:19.588]  Why did the government use al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs in 1998?
[00:48:20.808 --> 00:48:22.049]  You know, these are the questions.
[00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:23.050]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.212]  Mike in Illinois, Mike in Rhode Island, and others, you're up next.

[00:48:36.137 --> 00:48:37.438]  Alex Jones here, America.

[00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:02.193]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:49:02.273 --> 00:49:08.537]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:49:08.577 --> 00:49:10.398]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:51:38.554 --> 00:51:41.395]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:44.938 --> 00:51:46.999]  All right, folks, let's go straight back into your calls.
[00:51:47.019 --> 00:51:48.180]  We've got a guest joining us.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.461]  Mike in Rhode Island, you're on the air.
[00:51:50.521 --> 00:51:51.102]  Welcome, sir.
[00:51:51.122 --> 00:51:52.402]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[00:51:52.683 --> 00:51:53.103]  Fine, sir.
[00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:58.186]  Yeah, it seems an awful coincidence that Lord Bush's, all his people are quitting or resigning.
[00:51:58.446 --> 00:51:59.667]  What do you think might be going on there?
[00:52:01.132 --> 00:52:06.673]  Well, they do that generally right before an election so they don't have to answer questions of the media.
[00:52:07.213 --> 00:52:11.874]  Also, they go and cash in on book deals and TV deals, and I think that's a large part of it.
[00:52:11.894 --> 00:52:16.315]  I mean, we've got the press secretary resigning a couple days ago, but what else are you talking about?
[00:52:16.335 --> 00:52:17.215]  Who else is resigning?
[00:52:18.155 --> 00:52:18.876]  Christine Whitman.
[00:52:20.476 --> 00:52:20.996]  Ah, yes.
[00:52:21.056 --> 00:52:23.577]  Yes, she just resigned yesterday, I believe.
[00:52:24.817 --> 00:52:30.018]  And I don't know, maybe these people are developing a conscience possibly and seeing things going on, and maybe...
[00:52:30.751 --> 00:52:31.692]  You know, bothering them, maybe?
[00:52:31.712 --> 00:52:33.152]  You never know.
[00:52:33.853 --> 00:52:44.319]  Well, we know the head of FEMA quit, too, but he went off to help run the private merger of the government with the corporations, so a lot of them are being sent to other strategic locations.
[00:52:45.079 --> 00:52:48.101]  Oh, yeah, it's just totally crazy what's going on.
[00:52:48.681 --> 00:52:49.341]  All the bombings.
[00:52:49.622 --> 00:52:57.306]  I mean, I remember when you had Craig Roberts on your show, Colonel Craig Roberts, probably about a year ago, and he was saying that we are going into the period of escalating violence now.
[00:52:58.055 --> 00:52:58.995]  Boy, was he right on the money.
[00:52:59.536 --> 00:53:04.457]  Yeah, he said lots of bombings in Saudi Arabia and around the Middle East escalate all this, yes.
[00:53:04.777 --> 00:53:07.138]  Yes, they continue to take our rights away daily.
[00:53:07.558 --> 00:53:10.179]  And I just have a little thing I'd like to discuss.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.820]  I was talking to a former Marine yesterday.
[00:53:13.861 --> 00:53:15.361]  He's probably around 25 years old.
[00:53:15.381 --> 00:53:16.942]  And I was trying to talk to him about this stuff.
[00:53:17.002 --> 00:53:20.443]  And I basically asked him, point blank, I said, would you fire on an American citizen?
[00:53:21.484 --> 00:53:22.564]  And he said, if I was ordered to.
[00:53:24.432 --> 00:53:25.752]  So he hasn't read his handbook.
[00:53:25.772 --> 00:53:26.933]  He's not supposed to do that.
[00:53:26.973 --> 00:53:28.693]  It's totally illegal and totally criminal.
[00:53:28.853 --> 00:53:31.574]  Yeah, I tried telling him that, and I was explaining it to him.
[00:53:31.594 --> 00:53:32.354]  I gave him a few things.
[00:53:32.414 --> 00:53:34.354]  I told him, go to your website, check this stuff out.
[00:53:34.414 --> 00:53:35.474]  I said, don't believe what I say.
[00:53:36.115 --> 00:53:38.275]  Go do the investigation like I did.
[00:53:39.075 --> 00:53:39.735]  Absolutely.
[00:53:40.936 --> 00:53:42.116]  Well, he said he was open to it.
[00:53:42.296 --> 00:53:47.557]  He did say, though, he believes that there are definitely bombs in the towers at World Trade Center.
[00:53:47.697 --> 00:53:50.178]  But he's going to shoot Americans if the government says so.
[00:53:50.258 --> 00:53:51.338]  Yep, I can't understand that.
[00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:54.531]  Well, we know there were bombs in Building 7.
[00:53:54.591 --> 00:53:55.592]  That's just a fact.
[00:53:55.612 --> 00:53:58.493]  The building fell faster than it could from a normal implosion.
[00:53:59.814 --> 00:54:00.695]  Appreciate the call, Mike.
[00:54:00.715 --> 00:54:01.315]  Good to hear from you.
[00:54:01.755 --> 00:54:02.255]  Thank you.
[00:54:02.836 --> 00:54:04.016]  Appreciate it.
[00:54:04.177 --> 00:54:05.838]  Mike in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:54:05.898 --> 00:54:06.498]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:54:06.698 --> 00:54:07.518]  Alex, how you doing?
[00:54:07.679 --> 00:54:08.159]  Fantastic.
[00:54:08.219 --> 00:54:11.821]  I am so very disappointed that I did not know you were going to be on Mancow.
[00:54:11.981 --> 00:54:13.762]  I do not normally listen to his show.
[00:54:14.763 --> 00:54:17.484]  He's an all right guy, but I don't listen to his show.
[00:54:17.564 --> 00:54:19.345]  Had I known you were going to be on it, I would have listened.
[00:54:19.385 --> 00:54:20.326]  How long were you on there?
[00:54:20.965 --> 00:54:22.686]  Oh, I've been on it an hour and 20 minutes before.
[00:54:22.706 --> 00:54:24.567]  I was only on about 20 minutes this morning.
[00:54:24.627 --> 00:54:25.387]  Oh, my God.
[00:54:25.407 --> 00:54:27.889]  Well, that's a great, great exposure for you, Alex.
[00:54:27.949 --> 00:54:29.009]  Great exposure for you.
[00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:31.130]  That's a very well-listened-to show.
[00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:32.591]  Well, it's not exposure for me.
[00:54:32.691 --> 00:54:38.854]  I mean, Mancow heard me say the Marines were training with role players going, I'm an American, not the camp, and now he sees it in Chicago.
[00:54:38.874 --> 00:54:39.314]  Right.
[00:54:39.835 --> 00:54:40.175]  Absolutely.
[00:54:40.815 --> 00:54:43.376]  By the way, people were going to go get video of that.
[00:54:43.416 --> 00:54:44.417]  You were in Chicago.
[00:54:44.697 --> 00:54:46.278]  Alex, I told you I'd get your video.
[00:54:46.318 --> 00:54:48.019]  Let me explain something to you that happened to me.
[00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:48.639]  I went there.
[00:54:48.659 --> 00:54:50.320]  I actually took work off early that day.
[00:54:50.982 --> 00:54:59.365]  Went down there with a couple of my buddies, and you couldn't get within, I'd say, about three blocks of the area they had.
[00:54:59.405 --> 00:55:00.085]  You couldn't get there.
[00:55:00.525 --> 00:55:04.426]  And there was no vantage point, because it was all around buildings.
[00:55:04.947 --> 00:55:06.207]  It wasn't in downtown Chicago.
[00:55:06.227 --> 00:55:07.187]  It was outside of the city.
[00:55:07.628 --> 00:55:08.248]  I couldn't get in there.
[00:55:08.268 --> 00:55:09.588]  They had it all corned off with police.
[00:55:09.608 --> 00:55:11.309]  You couldn't get around there.
[00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:16.230]  I videotaped the police, and I will send you that tape, but it says, you know, you can't go there.
[00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.971]  We've got to shut down.
[00:55:16.991 --> 00:55:17.291]  There's a...
[00:55:18.611 --> 00:55:20.232]  Uh, exercise going on right now.
[00:55:20.492 --> 00:55:21.873]  We could not get in the area to do it.
[00:55:21.893 --> 00:55:26.355]  And inside they were training for forced injections and concentration camp shipping.
[00:55:26.935 --> 00:55:27.996]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:55:28.156 --> 00:55:29.156]  I'm telling you, it's mind-boggling.
[00:55:29.196 --> 00:55:31.798]  Oh, I mean, the big morning show in Chicago just said it.
[00:55:32.238 --> 00:55:34.299]  You know, that's his wake-up call, too.
[00:55:34.339 --> 00:55:36.680]  He was like, yeah, a year ago I didn't quite buy what you were saying.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:37.421]  Now I do.
[00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:40.082]  Alex, I'll tell you, I call a lot of...
[00:55:40.777 --> 00:55:41.418]  We're good to go.
[00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:41.918]  We're good to go.
[00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:42.339]  We're good to go.
[00:55:57.032 --> 00:55:59.214]  Alex, can I ask you a real quick question before the break there?
[00:55:59.294 --> 00:55:59.575]  Sure.
[00:56:00.576 --> 00:56:09.104]  Someone told me that the 9-11 attack, that there are 7,000 Jews that are employed in the World Trade Center, and they were not employed at work that day.
[00:56:09.124 --> 00:56:10.305]  Did you ever hear anything about that?
[00:56:10.625 --> 00:56:11.226]  That is true.
[00:56:11.326 --> 00:56:14.789]  MSNBC checked into it and said the urban legend was true.
[00:56:15.209 --> 00:56:18.833]  Also, the Jewish newspapers have reported they were told not to go to work.
[00:56:18.853 --> 00:56:19.914]  That is a confirmed fact.
[00:56:21.861 --> 00:56:38.497]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available in... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.026 --> 00:56:47.666]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.346 --> 00:56:49.367]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.107 --> 00:56:51.187]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.867 --> 00:56:52.688]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.448 --> 00:56:55.368]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.388 --> 00:56:58.789]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.189 --> 00:57:03.311]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:06.572 --> 00:57:08.092]  All right, there's been a lot of bombings.
[00:57:08.112 --> 00:57:11.593]  We're going to talk about the economy, the globalists, what they're all about.
[00:57:11.613 --> 00:57:14.634]  There was a story yesterday...
[00:57:16.074 --> 00:57:28.740]  Out of the Asia Times, not American Free Press, not the Portuguese newspapers, but this time out of the Asian Times, and also a couple of years ago there was a Reuters article about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:38.224]  I remember five, six, seven, eight years ago on the radio, I'd talk about the Bilderberg Group and get calls from listeners, I heard that's a code word for terrorism.
[00:57:38.264 --> 00:57:39.145]  It doesn't exist.
[00:57:39.185 --> 00:57:40.205]  You're insane.
[00:57:40.325 --> 00:57:42.946]  I heard on the news, insane people believe this exists.
[00:57:43.406 --> 00:57:44.467]  It doesn't exist.
[00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:55.862]  Well, it does exist, and now it's public, thanks to the work of folks out there, like Tony Gosling of Bilderberg.org, who's about to join us.
[00:57:56.964 --> 00:58:01.791]  The Asia Times reported the Masters of the Universe, and this is the headline.
[00:58:02.702 --> 00:58:06.845]  Middle East, The Roving Eye, The Masters of the Universe is the headline.
[00:58:07.485 --> 00:58:09.166]  It may be instructive to learn what U.S.
[00:58:09.206 --> 00:58:15.530]  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the Prince of Darkness Richard Perle were doing last weekend from May 15th to 18th.
[00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:23.776]  They were guests at the Palace Hotel close to the spectacular Versailles Palace near Paris for the annual meeting of the Bilderberg Club.
[00:58:24.895 --> 00:58:46.904]  And so depending on the ideological prism applied, the Bilderberg Club may be considered an ultra-VIP international lobby of the power elite of Europe and America capable of steering international policy from behind closed doors, or a harmless discussion group of politicians, academics, and business tycoons, or a capitalist secret society operating entirely through self-interest and plotting world domination.
[00:58:46.944 --> 00:58:50.045]  Well, we get the minutes out of it each year from spies inside.
[00:58:51.974 --> 00:58:52.455]  And we know.
[00:58:52.495 --> 00:58:53.736]  They're calling for world government.
[00:58:53.796 --> 00:58:55.798]  They basically decide who our presidents will be.
[00:58:55.918 --> 00:59:02.945]  Every year before an election, the two candidates will go before Bilderberg Group, and they'll be selected who will be president next.
[00:59:02.965 --> 00:59:03.966]  This is part of the record.
[00:59:05.407 --> 00:59:07.569]  And they're not even what you'd call capitalists.
[00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:08.630]  They're crony capitalists.
[00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:11.873]  They control fascism, communism, any way to consolidate power.
[00:59:12.794 --> 00:59:15.477]  And now joining us is Tony Gosling.
[00:59:16.505 --> 00:59:20.067]  And he was born in 1962 and brought up in Bromley, South London.
[00:59:20.087 --> 00:59:29.971]  He ended his formal education at Inkley College in West Yorkshire with a humanities degree specializing in English literature from Bradford University.
[00:59:30.051 --> 00:59:40.176]  After working for a few years in the family aviations part business, he decided to have a go at radio journalism, volunteering for GLC-funded radio programs.
[00:59:40.956 --> 00:59:41.617]  Oh yeah, hi Alex.
[00:59:41.657 --> 00:59:44.138]  I appreciate you coming on the broadcast.
[01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:10.463]  No problem.
[01:00:10.483 --> 01:00:13.666]  Yeah, I just got back a few days ago from Versailles.
[01:00:14.667 --> 01:00:17.650]  As always, the Bilderbergs meet in very posh locations.
[01:00:18.611 --> 01:00:23.236]  But, I mean, I think a lot of the stuff you're talking about exactly about what's on their agenda, what power they have.
[01:00:24.197 --> 01:00:26.439]  Some of it is speculation and some of it is fact.
[01:00:26.679 --> 01:00:33.486]  And one of the things I try and do with my website, the Bilderberg.org, is to separate the speculation from the fact.
[01:00:34.006 --> 01:00:37.607]  I actually pinned down what we really do know about this group.
[01:00:37.707 --> 01:00:41.128]  One thing most certainly is that they have a lot of power.
[01:00:42.308 --> 01:00:47.489]  They successfully managed to close down entirely the mainstream French press.
[01:00:47.529 --> 01:00:52.471]  It was only the Indymedia website in Paris that really had anything about this conference at all.
[01:00:53.031 --> 01:00:57.272]  Even though you've got kings and queens and some of the most powerful people on earth, there was almost no coverage whatsoever.
[01:00:58.965 --> 01:01:01.068]  Well, that shows the power of the group right there.
[01:01:01.088 --> 01:01:03.811]  I was talking about how five, six, seven years ago I'd talk about it.
[01:01:03.851 --> 01:01:05.893]  I'd get callers saying it doesn't exist.
[01:01:06.233 --> 01:01:08.636]  The news says it's a code word of evil people.
[01:01:09.077 --> 01:01:11.079]  Well, news for me is it definitely does exist.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.843]  I was quite surprised.
[01:01:14.883 --> 01:01:18.107]  There's always a few surprises if you turn up to try and cover a Bilderberg conference.
[01:01:18.127 --> 01:01:18.628]  There were about...
[01:01:19.128 --> 01:01:22.289]  I suppose between five and ten independent journalists down there.
[01:01:22.569 --> 01:01:23.509]  I want to hear about that.
[01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:24.990]  I want to hear about what happened.
[01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:26.650]  I want to talk about your website.
[01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:28.351]  I want to talk about the history of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:01:28.731 --> 01:01:29.691]  And I want to take calls.
[01:01:29.771 --> 01:01:36.994]  One of the premier experts on the Bilderberg Group, and hence the New World Order, Tony Gosling, our guest for this hour, joining us from Britain.
[01:01:37.654 --> 01:01:38.654]  You're welcome to join us at 800-259-9231.
[01:01:38.714 --> 01:01:39.354]  Tony, stay right there.

[01:02:26.786 --> 01:02:27.066]  Call today.
[01:02:42.774 --> 01:02:50.136]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:50.417 --> 01:02:55.158]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.378 --> 01:03:01.020]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.001]  We're good to go.
[01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:20.417]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:03:20.617 --> 01:03:27.381]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:03:27.581 --> 01:03:32.844]  Order online now at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:03:32.864 --> 01:03:33.264]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:41.508 --> 01:03:43.130]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:49.236]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:03:49.496 --> 01:03:54.621]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:03:54.962 --> 01:04:04.251]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:09.535]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:13.898]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:04:14.078 --> 01:04:18.862]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:25.127]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:04:25.467 --> 01:04:31.693]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:04:31.733 --> 01:04:32.714]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:04:32.774 --> 01:04:33.975]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:04:43.358 --> 01:04:45.558]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:45.578 --> 01:04:48.979]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:54.580]  From Washington, D.C.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:05.362]  to Rochester, New York, to Pensacola, Florida, to Austin, Texas, to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to the big redwoods of Northern California, we're on the AM and FM dial.
[01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:06.942]  The show is exploding and growing.
[01:05:06.962 --> 01:05:09.583]  We talk about the facts, the reality of the criminal elite.
[01:05:10.197 --> 01:05:25.867]  We simulcast on Global Shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 Central at 12.172 and 93.20 and from 9 to midnight Central at 5.085 and 68.90 and of course at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:05:26.908 --> 01:05:33.312]  Tomorrow we have Big Jim Tucker from American Free Press who's been covering the Bilderberg Group for over 25 years joining us.
[01:05:33.352 --> 01:05:37.655]  He just got back from Versailles where the power elite were meeting, carving up the world.
[01:05:38.692 --> 01:05:46.779]  And we're joined by one of the other premier researchers, long-term researchers, Tony Gosling, who just got back from France.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.243]  And he has worked as a documentary maker.
[01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:53.024]  He has worked for BBC.
[01:05:54.065 --> 01:06:00.351]  He is currently the Bristol Branch Secretary of the National Union of Journalists in England.
[01:06:00.951 --> 01:06:02.192]  And he just got back.
[01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:05.155]  There was absolutely no news in France about this.
[01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:16.469]  Other than the Indy Media sites, and he said there was just under 10 independent journalists that were there covering it to talk about the Bilderberg Group, the history of it, his adventures, what happened this year.
[01:06:17.585 --> 01:06:25.028]  And what they may have gotten out from the people inside the hotel, which they normally do, we're joined by Tony Gosling from the United Kingdom.
[01:06:25.088 --> 01:06:26.408]  Again, Tony, thanks for coming on.
[01:06:26.428 --> 01:06:27.269]  No problem.
[01:06:27.669 --> 01:06:38.673]  I really have to hand it to Jim, I have to say, because there's no way that we would be able to cover this conference, really, without Jim's work, because he's one of the only people on Earth that manages to winkle out where these guys are going to be meeting.
[01:06:39.613 --> 01:06:41.634]  And so, full respect to Jim Tucker.
[01:06:42.956 --> 01:06:43.556]  Absolutely.
[01:06:44.237 --> 01:06:47.759]  And he was covering it when nobody had heard of it 20-something years ago.
[01:06:47.779 --> 01:07:01.526]  I'm surprised there's not more interest in Europe as well about the Bilderberg Group because it clearly has an important role in pushing forward the latest European policies, pan-European policies.
[01:07:01.566 --> 01:07:05.668]  And of course they're now starting to talk about in Europe about the United States of Europe.
[01:07:06.475 --> 01:07:10.477]  And they're also taking a lot of people's liberties inside this system.
[01:07:10.517 --> 01:07:12.158]  They're getting rid of juries.
[01:07:12.198 --> 01:07:13.538]  They're getting rid of free speech.
[01:07:13.578 --> 01:07:19.061]  They're saying that people have to accept genetically modified food to destroy the food chain and local control.
[01:07:32.026 --> 01:07:33.507]  It's all about monopoly of power.
[01:07:33.547 --> 01:07:38.549]  Until about three years ago, I never saw mainstream articles about it other than American Free Press and your website.
[01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:54.477]  And it's starting to, the mainstream, some of the mainstream, at least independent mainstream, and it was really quite a perfect example because there was nobody from the big corporate, you know, the big newspapers that are controlled by these multinational media corporations.
[01:07:54.517 --> 01:08:00.060]  Now, about three years ago, Reuters did, about three years ago, Tony, Reuters did have an article saying,
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:06.729]  Where it did talk about Bilderberg Group and the kings and queens and the bankers that were there, did that shock you, and why do you think Reuters reported that?
[01:08:06.769 --> 01:08:15.281]  Well, often, you see, this stuff is put on Reuters in the knowledge that it's not going to be transmitted elsewhere, that the editors, et cetera, that received the Reuters service...
[01:08:16.583 --> 01:08:23.086]  We'll read it and they'll understand because there is only any information released to the press after the meeting's taken place.
[01:08:23.126 --> 01:08:29.469]  So of course there's no real opportunity for any critical comment of the people inside.
[01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:34.011]  Even though they release this document called a press release every year,
[01:08:35.492 --> 01:08:47.083]  It's surprising because, you know, as you'd expect that something on a press release would, and it usually is, designed for public consumption, after the first page of the press release it says strictly confidential.
[01:08:48.044 --> 01:08:50.686]  And then it follows a list of the participants at the meeting.
[01:08:50.746 --> 01:08:55.491]  So although they're quite happy to say after the event to the press that this has just taken place,
[01:08:56.518 --> 01:08:58.881]  And only to the mainstream press, by the way.
[01:08:59.121 --> 01:09:03.646]  I've requested a press release this year and received nothing at all from them, not even the basic text.
[01:09:04.987 --> 01:09:10.573]  So the fight goes on to find out exactly what these things are all about.
[01:09:11.053 --> 01:09:14.657]  This year, one of the big things they've been talking about is the European army.
[01:09:15.157 --> 01:09:17.299]  That definitely was on the agenda this year.
[01:09:17.339 --> 01:09:27.888]  There's attempts, of course, if you're trying to forge a political union in Europe, one of the main things is to make sure the military are all talking to each other because there's been, in the past, quite a lot of disputes.
[01:09:27.908 --> 01:09:32.172]  So this is something which is definitely on the agenda at Bilderberg.
[01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:44.475]  The other thing this year we found out was that they were definitely, as you'd expect, talking about post-Iraq Middle East, although they call it the Middle East post-terrorism.
[01:09:44.915 --> 01:09:49.057]  And I wonder, is that the terrorism of the United States and Great Britain they're talking about?
[01:09:49.237 --> 01:09:52.478]  Or is it terrorists in Iraq?
[01:09:52.578 --> 01:09:56.540]  I mean, this is all confusing language, and they're starting to get to the edge of what is credible.
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:01.162]  Now, Tony Gosling, again, former BBC reporter, documentary maker,
[01:10:02.422 --> 01:10:07.265]  Bristol Branch, Secretary of the National Union of Journalists, the website Bilderberg.org.
[01:10:07.285 --> 01:10:09.347]  We have a link to it on Infowars.com.
[01:10:09.367 --> 01:10:11.268]  I've got a list of questions here for you.
[01:10:11.288 --> 01:10:11.748]  Go for it, yeah.
[01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:14.610]  I want to, number one, talk about the history of Bilderberg Group.
[01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:22.696]  Then I want to talk about who was attending this year, the experiences you had trying to cover it there on the ground, some of the other journalists that were there.
[01:10:22.716 --> 01:10:24.177]  I also...
[01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:26.071]  We're good to go.
[01:10:41.367 --> 01:10:41.967]  I think we're good to go.
[01:11:01.715 --> 01:11:06.816]  The folks that attend and what you saw in your experience there in Versailles this year.
[01:11:07.177 --> 01:11:09.297]  Well, that's lots of different questions all rolled into one.
[01:11:09.917 --> 01:11:11.158]  But first of all, the history.
[01:11:11.178 --> 01:11:12.578]  It started in 1954.
[01:11:12.718 --> 01:11:20.780]  It was begun by two characters, one very open, the other one kind of in the shadows.
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.781]  The guy in the shadows was Joseph Rettinger.
[01:11:24.101 --> 01:11:26.161]  He was purported to be...
[01:11:28.602 --> 01:11:28.722]  Yeah.
[01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:58.744]  But the one who's a real high-profile character is Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, and of course his daughter, Beatrix, was there, got very close to her actually this time at this latest Bilderberg meeting in Versailles.
[01:12:00.164 --> 01:12:01.245]  So Bernhard started it.
[01:12:01.265 --> 01:12:10.507]  He's an interesting character, Bernhard, because he's both before and after he started at Bilderberg, had some really disastrous things happen to him, which throw...
[01:12:11.631 --> 01:12:14.031]  A lot of doubt over his integrity.
[01:12:14.091 --> 01:12:24.753]  First of all, his membership before the US entered World War II of the SS, the German SS.
[01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:31.655]  He then left Germany afterwards and married into the Dutch royal family, but he was in Hitler's feared SS during the war.
[01:12:31.935 --> 01:12:33.455]  This is the guy that started the group off.
[01:12:33.575 --> 01:12:38.756]  The irony is, of course, that they will tell us that one of the reasons for the group is to stop the next...
[01:12:40.336 --> 01:12:43.518]  Or to stop any other possible Hitler surfacing in the future.
[01:12:43.938 --> 01:12:49.481]  Now, I would have thought one of the worst people to start an organisation dedicated to that task was someone who'd been in Hitler's SS.
[01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:51.882]  Anyway, that's what he did.
[01:12:51.962 --> 01:13:04.147]  Back in 1954, he got the first meeting together, and he was chairman of Bilderberg, and he kind of presided over the meetings up until 1975, where there was a massive scandal involving the Prince.
[01:13:04.227 --> 01:13:05.528]  He was discovered to have...
[01:13:07.873 --> 01:13:14.396]  He was discovered to have taken a million-dollar bribe from Lockheed to get the Dutch government to buy the Starfighter aircraft.
[01:13:15.236 --> 01:13:27.462]  And there was evidence that, well, first of all, he denied it, but then some evidence came to light that it's a piece of scribbled notepaper written by the Prince, which explained, yes, he had actually taken a million-dollar bribe, and he'd laundered it through some charity that he was involved with,
[01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:32.345]  And so this completely discredited the prince for good, really, in Holland.
[01:13:32.405 --> 01:13:34.946]  And he's still not taken all that seriously by the people.
[01:13:34.986 --> 01:13:40.628]  We also have Kurt Waldheim, the Nazi, running the UN from 72 to 82 as their Secretary General.
[01:13:41.029 --> 01:13:45.630]  So we see this system being peopled by basically crump agents.
[01:13:46.151 --> 01:13:51.033]  And we also have the prince, who would be the king, in Germany during the war.
[01:13:52.394 --> 01:14:03.420]  Well, the King and Queen of Spain were at this latest Bilderberg meeting.
[01:14:04.601 --> 01:14:05.862]  I don't know, I haven't seen the list.
[01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:08.403]  I hope they're both on the list, but we definitely saw them.
[01:14:08.423 --> 01:14:09.124]  We spotted them.
[01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:12.226]  Have you seen the list this year, Alex?
[01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:15.116]  No, but... Has anyone managed to get you a copy?
[01:14:15.156 --> 01:14:16.437]  I think as many people as possible.
[01:14:16.457 --> 01:14:19.478]  It would be really good to phone up the Bilderberg office.
[01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:21.019]  Their phone number is on my website.
[01:14:21.059 --> 01:14:25.201]  And maybe leave a message saying, please, could we have a list of people who attended?
[01:14:25.641 --> 01:14:28.523]  Because this is the first year so far that they've refused to send me the list.
[01:14:28.623 --> 01:14:30.544]  Normally, I publish the list after the meeting.
[01:14:30.964 --> 01:14:36.987]  And one would have thought that there's no reason, the security, there's no security reason why they can't now send me a list of people who were there.
[01:14:37.227 --> 01:14:38.147]  But you were there.
[01:14:38.167 --> 01:14:38.848]  They decided not to.
[01:14:39.568 --> 01:14:47.933]  Sir, you were there this year, and we're going to talk about that, how you got close to Queen Beatrix, but the thing I wanted to cover here was this Asia Times article.
[01:14:48.413 --> 01:14:59.940]  Pepe Escobar wrote an article about Masters of the Universe, about the Prince of Darkness, as they call him, Richard Pearl and Donald Rumsfeld, there at the meeting as well.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.781]  These are current members of the administration.
[01:15:01.821 --> 01:15:02.681]  Can you confirm that?
[01:15:03.141 --> 01:15:04.782]  Well, certainly I can confirm Richard Pearl.
[01:15:04.802 --> 01:15:07.644]  I definitely saw him, and I put a picture of him up on my webpages.
[01:15:08.485 --> 01:15:10.568]  But Rumsfeld, I'm not sure about, I'm afraid.
[01:15:11.369 --> 01:15:21.103]  I mean, the list of people who attend is kind of a flaky affair because you're never quite sure if the people who have turned up
[01:15:21.836 --> 01:15:25.158]  Are going to be on the list, especially if they're only there for one afternoon or something.
[01:15:25.198 --> 01:15:30.200]  For example, there were very strong rumours that Chirac was turning up.
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:38.403]  In fact, a helicopter, especially quiet helicopter, appeared early on Saturday morning and then disappeared later on in the day from the area of the hotel.
[01:15:38.883 --> 01:15:46.847]  So we were very... There seemed to be some evidence, and also from staff inside the hotel, telling us that Chirac was due.
[01:15:48.448 --> 01:15:53.211]  So, yes, there's all sorts of people that may be there and may be aren't.
[01:15:53.251 --> 01:15:54.131]  So we have to kind of guess.
[01:15:54.231 --> 01:15:56.333]  When we get the list, at least there's something to go on.
[01:15:56.353 --> 01:15:57.653]  But at the moment, we've got no list at all.
[01:15:57.974 --> 01:16:03.557]  Now, we're talking to Tony Gosling, Bilderberg.org, premier website exposing this.
[01:16:03.577 --> 01:16:05.018]  We've got Jim Tucker coming on tomorrow.
[01:16:07.099 --> 01:16:09.520]  We'll talk about some of your other experiences while you were there.
[01:16:09.581 --> 01:16:11.602]  But a question I have when we get back, Jim Tucker...
[01:16:12.353 --> 01:16:17.915]  Last year at the last meeting said, no, the invasion is not in 2002, like the media is saying is for sure.
[01:16:18.375 --> 01:16:20.156]  It's going to be in February or March.
[01:16:21.056 --> 01:16:22.397]  And then that, of course, happened.
[01:16:22.437 --> 01:16:26.858]  He said he saw Arab leaders there, which he never sees, showing this.
[01:16:26.898 --> 01:16:36.902]  So we'll talk about that and how Jim Tucker, and you use the same tactics, talks to people around the hotel before, gets the staff to leak key information after they see how evil these people are.
[01:16:37.442 --> 01:16:41.043]  We'll talk about it on the other side when we get back with our guests covering Bilderberg Group.
[01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:43.490]  We're good to go.
[01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:02.137]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:17:31.906 --> 01:17:34.949]  Coin values are always changing and so is the Redbook Guide to U.S.
[01:17:35.009 --> 01:17:35.369]  Coins.
[01:17:35.770 --> 01:17:36.430]  Get the 2003 edition today.
[01:17:36.450 --> 01:17:36.690]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:45.997]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:17:46.197 --> 01:17:58.487]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:17:58.907 --> 01:17:59.327]  The U.S.
[01:17:59.367 --> 01:18:04.952]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:18:05.352 --> 01:18:07.554]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:18:09.415 --> 01:18:09.875]  We're good to go.
[01:18:30.249 --> 01:18:30.450]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:18:43.775 --> 01:18:44.315]  It's here.
[01:18:44.576 --> 01:18:45.296]  It's powerful.
[01:18:45.596 --> 01:18:54.182]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[01:18:54.482 --> 01:18:56.303]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[01:18:56.584 --> 01:18:58.685]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[01:18:58.925 --> 01:19:03.148]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[01:19:03.448 --> 01:19:09.173]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[01:19:09.353 --> 01:19:11.135]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[01:19:11.295 --> 01:19:14.518]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[01:19:14.718 --> 01:19:16.279]  Get the powerful Berkey now.
[01:19:16.539 --> 01:19:23.065]  Ideal for everyday use, for outdoor sporting events, and in the event of a local or national emergency, you'll be prepared.
[01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:23.805]  Normally $279.

[01:19:28.067 --> 01:19:28.487]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:28.567 --> 01:19:30.868]  Not yet available in California and Iowa.
[01:19:40.501 --> 01:19:46.865]  Ted Pike's monumental new video, Why the Medis Bleeds, exposes the two main causes of international Arab terrorism.
[01:19:46.946 --> 01:19:50.548]  First, a century of Zionist abuses, an atrocity against Palestinians.
[01:19:50.628 --> 01:19:53.390]  Second, evangelical Christian support for such abuses.
[01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:57.813]  The unprecedented video documents how the Talmud incites Israeli aggression.
[01:19:57.873 --> 01:20:02.056]  How the loss of freedom under homeland security results from unconditional support of Israel.
[01:20:02.216 --> 01:20:10.658]  It exposes what really happened in the West Bank under Sharon's 2002 invasion and how Bush is making possible Israel's control of the entire Mideast.
[01:20:10.738 --> 01:20:18.981]  Michael Collins Piper of the American Free Press says, Pike's video, Why the Mideast Bleeds, is the most straightforward, fact-filled presentation available today.
[01:20:19.361 --> 01:20:20.401]  It's a must-see.
[01:20:20.481 --> 01:20:25.943]  Send $25 to Ted Pike, Box 203, Oregon City, Oregon, 97045.
[01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:31.024]  Why the Mideast Bleeds, Ted Pike's monumental video, is available now.
[01:20:31.264 --> 01:20:35.886]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:20:35.906 --> 01:20:37.766]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:57.702 --> 01:21:05.470]  We're talking to veteran journalist, documentary maker, BBC reporter, Tony Gosling from the United Kingdom.
[01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:11.355]  He now is the Bristol branch secretary of the National Union of Journalists and does a lot of work.
[01:21:11.375 --> 01:21:12.937]  Bilderberg.org is the website.
[01:21:12.957 --> 01:21:15.059]  You can link through at Infowars.com if you'd like.
[01:21:15.908 --> 01:21:16.968]  Tony, you've got the floor.
[01:21:16.988 --> 01:21:19.710]  I mean, you're the expert in the Bilderberg Group more than I am.
[01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:31.354]  I just hear the stories from Jim and read his articles that later turn out to be very accurate, how he'll go to the hotel days before check-in, before they kick him out, tell the employees, give me information on these people.
[01:21:31.394 --> 01:21:32.175]  They refuse.
[01:21:32.495 --> 01:21:36.756]  When they see how mean and evil these people are, they then come to him and give him the information.
[01:21:37.237 --> 01:21:42.999]  He's really gotten vital intel showing these guys are steering much of the world's apparatus.
[01:21:43.559 --> 01:21:45.884]  This is a very high level elite group, but can you talk about...
[01:21:47.253 --> 01:22:07.857]  You know, some of the reportage in the past... Well, it's interesting you're using the term of vile and evil, Alex, because one of the opportunities I had this time in Versailles on the Saturday... If you can imagine, the hotel is probably the most extravagant hotel in Paris.
[01:22:08.417 --> 01:22:15.499]  On the edge of Paris, in a beautiful suburb, the entire hotel was surrounded by two cordons of...
[01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:27.293]  The French CRS, that's the riot police, obviously expecting, because they had riot police there, we were expecting maybe some demonstrators, but no demonstrators appeared.
[01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:45.460]  Anyway, on the Saturday, after lunch, the Bilderbergers decided that there was obviously, maybe they'd been having too many heated discussions, but then they decided to go for a little kind of tourist ride up to the actual Palace of Versailles, which is just literally a stone's throw away around the corner from the hotel that they were staying in.
[01:22:46.418 --> 01:22:49.381]  And that gave us the opportunity to get pictures of a lot of them.
[01:22:50.401 --> 01:23:00.309]  Obviously that's one of the things that they try and make sure that nobody knows who's in there before the end of the conference, before they give out their official so-called press release to the mainstream press.
[01:23:00.970 --> 01:23:07.515]  Incidentally, the BBC have got a copy of this and I phoned them up earlier on asking them to get hold of it and because they're doing a documentary they're going to keep it quiet.
[01:23:08.155 --> 01:23:15.803]  They're doing the first, as far as I know, BBC documentary on the Bilderberg meetings on 3rd July this year.
[01:23:16.987 --> 01:23:20.790]  So, yeah, we got an opportunity to meet some of the Bilderbergers, even have a little chat with them.
[01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:22.591]  I mean, I was quite surprised.
[01:23:22.671 --> 01:23:32.257]  One of the Norwegian photographers there said, hey, there's a couple of American guys, they look like Bilderbergers, because they're all wearing the kind of suits, whereas most of the people around the palace were kind of tourists.
[01:23:32.297 --> 01:23:39.281]  But tourists were all taken by surprise, as all these kings and queens and stuff suddenly turned up to do a little tour of the palace.
[01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:41.262]  And walking through the...
[01:23:43.464 --> 01:23:44.084]  We're good to go.
[01:23:59.464 --> 01:24:00.544]  You know, and I was quite surprised.
[01:24:00.604 --> 01:24:03.445]  I was almost expecting him to be, look, I'm not talking to the press, etc.
[01:24:03.465 --> 01:24:09.427]  But he seemed quite happy to have a bit of a chat about some of the things that go on inside the conference.
[01:24:09.527 --> 01:24:13.688]  Sir, who's that lord who John Ronson interviews and he starts yelling and cussing at him?
[01:24:13.728 --> 01:24:14.948]  Lord Healy, yes, Lord Healy.
[01:24:15.228 --> 01:24:17.869]  I mean, that guy's like, you scum sucker!
[01:24:18.289 --> 01:24:21.250]  I mean, that's how Tucker says they act.
[01:24:22.011 --> 01:24:30.480]  Well, no, I mean, some of them do and some of them don't, but I think it seems that the inner circle really don't like to kind of get angry.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:37.027]  It's only the people on the outside and the security associated with the... The people who are in the inner circle are quite calm.
[01:24:37.308 --> 01:24:38.889]  For example, I had a chat to Kenneth Clark.
[01:24:38.929 --> 01:24:41.813]  He just said, I'm sorry, I can't talk about what's going on.
[01:24:42.533 --> 01:24:44.194]  It did seem reasonably reasonable.
[01:24:46.595 --> 01:25:00.320]  I just don't like to paint these people as evil, because they are human beings, and if we're going to reach them in any way and persuade them to take on some of the subjects in the world which we want them to take on, if we demonise them, they're never going to listen.
[01:25:02.668 --> 01:25:05.249]  Well, I mean, they demonize the patriot movement.
[01:25:05.289 --> 01:25:06.690]  They demonize those that fight them.
[01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:09.972]  They have their media put out reports that they don't exist, and crazies think they do.
[01:25:10.952 --> 01:25:14.694]  The things they do are evil, and I'm going off what Tucker says.
[01:25:15.629 --> 01:25:22.353]  The staff will never talk to him, but after the Bilderberg groups is so mean to him that they will talk to him.
[01:25:22.393 --> 01:25:23.374]  That's what Tucker has said.
[01:25:23.974 --> 01:25:25.415]  Yeah, I think that's true.
[01:25:25.455 --> 01:25:34.420]  I mean, some of the people in the group are, and certainly the security are over... I mean, for example, I was taking photographs of some of them in this kind of buggy as they were leaving.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:35.020]  They had to wait.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.741]  It was quite amusing, really, because they had to wait...
[01:25:37.842 --> 01:25:48.148]  For about five or ten minutes, about 100 Bilderbergs, 90 or so Bilderbergs, outside the palace, they had to wait for five or six of the women who were with the party to finish shopping in the gift shop.
[01:25:48.548 --> 01:25:51.310]  And, of course, they were very embarrassed because they didn't really want photographs taken anyway.
[01:25:51.330 --> 01:25:55.813]  And the fact that they had to wait for the women in the gift shop brought the whole occasion down to earth.
[01:25:55.833 --> 01:26:00.636]  So even if they are the richest and most powerful people in the world, they still have problems with...
[01:26:01.796 --> 01:26:04.458]  You know, people taking too long in the gift shop.
[01:26:04.678 --> 01:26:05.018]  All right.
[01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:06.520]  We'll take some calls when we get back.
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:08.821]  Any other points you want to hit on, Tony Gosling?
[01:26:09.322 --> 01:26:16.186]  I want to talk about what they were discussing in there, how you got the information, what Jim says that he's gotten if he told you.
[01:26:16.727 --> 01:26:18.348]  It's all coming up after this quick break.
[01:26:18.388 --> 01:26:21.390]  By the way, we have Jim Tucker's articles on Infowars.com.
[01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:25.273]  We have a link to Vildenberg.org as well with Tony Gosling, our guest.
[01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:26.494]  So stay with us.
[01:26:26.534 --> 01:26:27.754]  Toll free number to join us on air, 800-259-9231.
[01:26:27.774 --> 01:26:28.275]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:33.152 --> 01:26:34.093]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.553 --> 01:26:36.174]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.194 --> 01:26:39.855]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.757 --> 01:26:48.960]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.782]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most action.
[01:26:53.802 --> 01:26:53.942]  7-7-6-0-5-9-2-100.
[01:26:53.962 --> 01:26:54.362]  Call today.
[01:27:15.743 --> 01:27:28.614]  Tony Gosling is a veteran BBC reporter now working with Contact Video Network and the EconoVillage Network UK, Bristol branch secretary of the National Union of Journalists.
[01:27:29.255 --> 01:27:31.037]  His website is Bilderberg.org.
[01:27:31.097 --> 01:27:32.598]  He's covered many of the conferences.
[01:27:33.158 --> 01:27:35.881]  Obviously, no one has covered more than Jim Tucker, who's joining us tomorrow.
[01:27:37.749 --> 01:27:40.811]  And we're going to take some calls coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:27:40.831 --> 01:28:01.640]  If you have any questions about the Bilderberg Group or about the things that he saw or when he talked to Queen Beatrix or David Rockefeller, because I guess that they had all their black ski mask riot police out, the Darth Vaders protecting them, the big crowds didn't show up to protest, so they decided to amble on down, I guess, in the middle of the conference to the Palace of Versailles next door from their five-star hotel.
[01:28:02.978 --> 01:28:04.039]  You have a chance to talk to him.
[01:28:04.059 --> 01:28:05.480]  I want to explore that more.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:16.227]  And then we'll get to some of your calls at 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:28:17.468 --> 01:28:18.929]  You say you talked to David Rockefeller.
[01:28:18.969 --> 01:28:21.831]  What were the questions you asked him and his bodyguard?
[01:28:21.871 --> 01:28:22.932]  What responses did you get?
[01:28:23.252 --> 01:28:26.034]  You say you got a chance to talk to some of the others, Queen Beatrix.
[01:28:26.314 --> 01:28:27.195]  Tell us about that, please.
[01:28:27.575 --> 01:28:30.798]  No, I didn't get a chance to talk to Beatrix, although she was very close by.
[01:28:30.818 --> 01:28:34.801]  She was with a kind of whole gaggle of Bilderbergs who were visiting the hotel.
[01:28:34.821 --> 01:28:37.123]  Okay, who did you get a chance to talk to then?
[01:28:37.203 --> 01:28:37.904]  I misunderstood.
[01:28:37.924 --> 01:28:38.704]  Yeah, David Rockefeller.
[01:28:38.724 --> 01:28:41.367]  The first thing I asked him was about the press conference.
[01:28:41.427 --> 01:28:43.609]  I said, really, why don't you have a press conference?
[01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.969]  And he didn't.
[01:28:44.668 --> 01:28:47.051]  He didn't actually answer the question.
[01:28:47.611 --> 01:28:56.681]  And then I pressed him a bit more and he said, well, we don't really have a lot of important things we're talking about in there.
[01:28:57.302 --> 01:29:03.609]  And I expressed my incredulity about that and explained to him that
[01:29:04.164 --> 01:29:14.714]  You know, I think that what they're discussing is the exchanges about the state of the world and that these are subjects which everyone on Earth has an interest in and there are a lot of views which just simply aren't represented at Bilderberg.
[01:29:15.425 --> 01:29:18.467]  You see, they always say that they have a consensus.
[01:29:18.727 --> 01:29:33.575]  That consensus is a totally artificial consensus because they make sure that it's only people who are really already in one way or another into the United States of Europe or the European-American project, the war on terrorism and all this kind of stuff.
[01:29:34.156 --> 01:29:36.337]  So it's a completely artificial consensus.
[01:29:37.017 --> 01:29:42.000]  So I pressed him on the idea of having a press conference and he said he didn't think it was a good idea.
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:43.241]  And I said, well, all the time,
[01:29:43.841 --> 01:29:46.484]  Tony, you have all these big industrialists, all the big bankers,
[01:30:08.525 --> 01:30:08.966]  We're good to go.
[01:30:08.986 --> 01:30:09.126]  I think?
[01:30:26.287 --> 01:30:28.188]  They really are setting much of the agenda.
[01:30:28.228 --> 01:30:28.769]  We know that.
[01:30:28.849 --> 01:30:31.370]  So the first thing out of Rockefeller's mouth then was a lie.
[01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:33.991]  And you may not say that as a journalist, but I will.
[01:30:34.151 --> 01:30:36.433]  And look at this quote by David Rockefeller.
[01:30:36.993 --> 01:30:38.974]  I say he's evil because of quotes like this.
[01:30:39.034 --> 01:30:40.335]  And I have the New York Times article.
[01:30:41.284 --> 01:30:44.688]  August 10th, 1973, about the death of Mao Zedong.
[01:30:45.048 --> 01:30:54.377]  Whatever the price of the Chinese Revolution, it has obviously succeeded, not only in producing more efficient and dedicated administration, but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose.
[01:30:54.737 --> 01:31:00.443]  The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.
[01:31:00.823 --> 01:31:04.287]  David Rockefeller's statement in 1973 about Mao Zedong, New York Times, August 10th, 1973.
[01:31:06.187 --> 01:31:08.108]  So, you know, that's evil.
[01:31:08.468 --> 01:31:13.831]  And David Rockefeller is a globalist whose policies are set up to destroy America.
[01:31:14.211 --> 01:31:15.972]  We know the Carnegie Endowment's doing that.
[01:31:16.332 --> 01:31:18.713]  We know what these people are about, and I'll say it.
[01:31:20.965 --> 01:31:22.026]  Yeah.
[01:31:22.186 --> 01:31:29.790]  Well, the other thing, of course, is that they say that they invite Russians as well, and you're quite right, the Carnegie Endowment are the people that come, which, of course, is an American organisation.
[01:31:30.170 --> 01:31:43.798]  So they're not, I mean, even though they try and make out that their borders aren't just NATO, European Union, you know, and Canada, these most powerful of the Western countries, I would imagine, you know, for many people outside the Western world,
[01:31:44.378 --> 01:31:44.959]  We're good to go.
[01:31:45.059 --> 01:31:45.499]  We're good to go.
[01:32:01.829 --> 01:32:03.310]  And, of course, it's not even on the agenda.
[01:32:03.330 --> 01:32:08.031]  So that was the next thing I brought up with David was saying, look, why can't you have debt relief up on the agenda?
[01:32:08.471 --> 01:32:14.352]  It's one of the most important meetings in the world that actually could do something about this.
[01:32:14.392 --> 01:32:15.392]  So bring it on the agenda.
[01:32:15.973 --> 01:32:21.014]  And, again, he just sort of gave me a bit of an anodyne reply saying, well, this isn't the kind of thing we normally talk about.
[01:32:21.074 --> 01:32:23.655]  And, you know, well, no excuse, really.
[01:32:23.675 --> 01:32:25.255]  Oh, sure.
[01:32:25.635 --> 01:32:29.056]  They don't talk about international banking and the debt with third world countries.
[01:32:29.116 --> 01:32:29.396]  Sure.
[01:32:31.064 --> 01:32:33.787]  It's one of the things that definitely should be on the agenda.
[01:32:33.807 --> 01:32:42.755]  Now, Big Jim Tucker has said that in his articles that this is illegal because of our laws in this country to have public officials in secret meetings with private institutions.
[01:32:43.115 --> 01:32:44.196]  He says it's illegal.
[01:32:44.757 --> 01:32:47.920]  Well, if there have been any prosecutions, I'd like to see a test case.
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:48.921]  That would be very interesting.
[01:32:49.321 --> 01:32:55.827]  Also, in the European, I've only just found out today that there were questions asked about Bilderberg in the European Parliament at the end of last month.
[01:32:57.306 --> 01:33:01.329]  And they had to admit that there were going to be three of the European commissioners.
[01:33:01.769 --> 01:33:10.316]  Now, I don't know how well Americans know how European structures work, but basically Europe is being run now by a commission of appointed people.
[01:33:10.336 --> 01:33:13.499]  I mean, none of them are elected.
[01:33:13.559 --> 01:33:17.562]  Nobody can elect them out of office, even if they turn into tyrants.
[01:33:17.862 --> 01:33:26.484]  Well, they wouldn't allow... This is a serious problem over in Europe of actually raising consciousness, and maybe in the States as well, to make people realise that this is a totally appointed body.
[01:33:26.804 --> 01:33:36.187]  And the laughable thing is that most of the commissioners, if not all of the commissioners, certainly all the ones I know from the UK, have been failed politicians, politicians that people have voted out.
[01:33:36.547 --> 01:33:41.688]  And now they're then promoted to an invulnerable position of running Europe as part of the European government.
[01:33:41.948 --> 01:33:45.829]  In fact, Romano Prodi, who's the chairman of the European Commission...
[01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:48.730]  Well, that's the point I'm trying to make here is that
[01:34:09.523 --> 01:34:17.550]  Is that whether it's regionalism in this country, you'll have the states and regional groupings, you have an unelected board running things.
[01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:21.613]  Well, we're already talking about Romano Proteus, the president of Europe.
[01:34:21.833 --> 01:34:35.585]  Let me just finish this real quick, Tony, because this regionalism, we have counties that are in regional government with unelected people, we have the states, we have the federal government, we have this system, and now you talk about the EU where they won't even allow people to have votes on referendums.
[01:34:35.885 --> 01:34:37.305]  Yeah, this guy has never been voted in.
[01:34:37.345 --> 01:34:39.366]  He's now being talked about as the president of Europe.
[01:34:39.486 --> 01:34:41.307]  In fact, he's another failed politician.
[01:34:42.187 --> 01:34:51.790]  It just seems to me as if the people who are running, certainly the Bilderbergs, the people who are running Europe, are really poking one in the eye to the public.
[01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:53.711]  So it's dictatorship on the face of it, sir.
[01:34:53.731 --> 01:34:54.831]  Let's just call it what it is.
[01:34:58.914 --> 01:35:02.056]  Yeah, well, I mean, at least it has the potential for that.
[01:35:02.076 --> 01:35:04.737]  I don't think it's quite got that bad right now.
[01:35:04.857 --> 01:35:05.297]  Oh, really?
[01:35:05.337 --> 01:35:17.043]  I mean, we need to always have checks and balances in our politics to make sure that we can get... Well, you've got the presidency, and it's going to be appointed, and they're getting rid of juries and getting rid of rights and passing thought crime laws.
[01:35:17.123 --> 01:35:18.043]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:35:18.283 --> 01:35:24.006]  Yeah, it's certainly frightening when you look at Hitler's dream, Fortress Europe, you know,
[01:35:25.367 --> 01:35:28.650]  And now it's kind of almost as if it's all happening all over again.
[01:35:29.811 --> 01:35:32.813]  I know, Tony Gosling, you've got other key points you want to add.
[01:35:32.833 --> 01:35:33.874]  We've been so honored to have you.
[01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:39.138]  We've got some callers that want to talk to you about these issues.
[01:35:39.198 --> 01:35:44.923]  Can I just finish by saying a little bit about my website and about what I've decided to do with it?
[01:35:45.223 --> 01:35:48.586]  Sure, we'll discuss that, and then we've got to go straight to these calls.
[01:35:48.606 --> 01:35:49.427]  Very, very quickly.
[01:35:49.907 --> 01:35:50.507]  Hold on, Tommy.
[01:35:50.588 --> 01:35:54.251]  After this year, this is the only second Bilderberg meeting I've actually been to.
[01:35:54.331 --> 01:35:58.814]  Most I've been covering from my office, just sort of taking information and putting them up.
[01:35:58.854 --> 01:36:07.822]  But after this meeting, I really made a decision that I was going to try and get to all meetings, as many as I could in the future, until they have a press conference.
[01:36:07.882 --> 01:36:12.946]  Even if it's on the last day, and a few people will be rolled out to talk to the press,
[01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:22.873]  Because the main thing I dislike about it is their ability to completely close down the free press in France is really quite unnerving.
[01:36:23.154 --> 01:36:27.960]  Does that include, Tony, their staring meetings that they have with leaders of our government?
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:30.241]  Well, I'm not sure.
[01:36:30.261 --> 01:36:35.385]  I mean, all I know is that when they have their annual conference, there is almost no coverage.
[01:36:35.405 --> 01:36:38.687]  And we heard this year that they have ordered a press blackout.
[01:36:38.807 --> 01:36:42.991]  So the fact that these people can just say, no, there will be no coverage, I find itself frightening.
[01:36:43.231 --> 01:36:48.335]  Well, they also have the armies of governments generally are also there protecting them.
[01:36:48.935 --> 01:36:50.116]  Was that the case this year?
[01:36:51.117 --> 01:36:55.700]  Well, there certainly seemed to be a lot of, well, I suppose you have to call it secret service.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:58.242]  We had watchers on us, I mean, the group of journalists that were there.
[01:36:59.474 --> 01:36:59.594]  5 or 6.
[01:36:59.934 --> 01:37:03.936]  We certainly wouldn't go off on our own because there were kind of people wandering around with dark glasses.
[01:37:03.976 --> 01:37:06.196]  I mean, it really was like something out of a James Bond movie.
[01:37:07.677 --> 01:37:13.178]  These French people, at least we assume they were French, they didn't seem to like talking when we started going over and chatting with them.
[01:37:13.198 --> 01:37:14.139]  They'd just sort of walk off.
[01:37:14.459 --> 01:37:17.740]  They were watching us the whole time, so I think we have to assume that the French Secret Service were there.
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:31.183]  Well, sir... And certainly the Ministry of the Interior were asking all of the journalists who they didn't know, one reason or another they didn't ask me, but for their press details, for their cars and for their identification.
[01:37:31.504 --> 01:37:35.125]  But one thing I did all over the entire time is I refused to show my ID.
[01:37:35.585 --> 01:37:36.465]  I wasn't into that.
[01:37:36.765 --> 01:37:39.506]  Yeah, you should be free to do that, but let me just add another point here.
[01:37:39.586 --> 01:37:40.346]  This is important.
[01:37:40.946 --> 01:37:46.273]  We've had journalists arrested, basically kidnapped out of their hotel rooms or off the street in the past.
[01:37:46.914 --> 01:37:52.260]  John Ronson has video of the dark cars with the men in sunglasses following him and Jim Tucker around.
[01:37:52.941 --> 01:37:54.162]  So we know this goes on.
[01:37:54.403 --> 01:37:55.244]  Yeah.
[01:37:55.444 --> 01:37:58.568]  All of the security was done by the French state.
[01:37:59.088 --> 01:38:04.331]  So, I mean, for them to say that it's a private meeting, I think, is really not credible at all.
[01:38:04.711 --> 01:38:14.015]  I mean, they seem to troll out a lot of these things, meeting to meeting, just saying that either it's a private meeting or that it's nothing to do with government.
[01:38:14.055 --> 01:38:22.339]  And then you see all these top government officials, for example, they have the Foreign Minister of France and the Home, what I think they call Ministry of the Interior of France at the meeting,
[01:38:23.159 --> 01:38:27.822]  And of course, at least it's involving the government.
[01:38:27.842 --> 01:38:29.402]  So they can't say it's a private meeting.
[01:38:29.422 --> 01:38:32.144]  We've got some of the most powerful people in Europe in government positions there.
[01:38:32.464 --> 01:38:40.048]  I want to talk about some of the information that you found out of what was being discussed inside Bilderberg, because that bodes for the next year.
[01:38:40.088 --> 01:38:41.849]  But right now, let's go to Ken in Texas.
[01:38:41.889 --> 01:38:42.669]  Ken, thanks for holding.
[01:38:42.909 --> 01:38:45.731]  You're on the air with our guest, Tony Gosling of Bilderberg.org.
[01:38:45.751 --> 01:38:46.091]  Go ahead.
[01:38:49.444 --> 01:38:50.965]  Alex, I listen to your show all the time.
[01:38:50.985 --> 01:38:51.565]  I'm a big fan.
[01:38:51.905 --> 01:38:52.565]  Well, thank you, Ken.
[01:38:52.585 --> 01:38:53.105]  You're on the air.
[01:38:53.125 --> 01:38:53.766]  What's on your mind?
[01:38:54.426 --> 01:39:14.393]  Well, you know, this Bilderberg group, they're one of several groups that have this sort of superhuman ability, and their staff are populated or whatever by people who are rich and have been throughout their lineage for generations, rich beyond the wildest dreams of your average person.
[01:39:15.233 --> 01:39:16.653]  And they have the power...
[01:39:19.082 --> 01:39:20.062]  If money equals power.
[01:39:20.082 --> 01:39:38.911]  They have the power to do anything they want, send mercenaries out, sort of cull and cultivate their own diplomats and put people into office through fellowships and pick the people they want to put through college and put in fraternities.
[01:39:39.051 --> 01:39:41.532]  I don't know.
[01:39:41.632 --> 01:39:45.434]  I think it's really kind of frightening how untouchable these people seem to be.
[01:39:47.995 --> 01:39:50.256]  Well, I can say that they're not untouchable.
[01:39:50.536 --> 01:39:52.377]  You can go up and shake one's hand if you want.
[01:39:52.417 --> 01:39:59.160]  In fact, a guy who's been a photographer at the Bilderberg meetings for quite a long time, Chris, who works for American Free Press, is now living in Germany.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.341]  And he's always good fun.
[01:40:01.381 --> 01:40:03.682]  You know, he's always got a good sense of humour.
[01:40:04.082 --> 01:40:28.047]  And you know, I think this is one of the ways to, if you want, trump the Bilderbergers, is with humour, because what they do is kind of insane, in a way, you know, to have all this massive security, two rings of French riot police keeping people about half a mile away from the hotel then, on a Saturday, to let everybody go out on a kind of little train ride into the park amongst the tourists, you know, kind of ridiculous, really.
[01:40:28.747 --> 01:40:33.128]  I'm sure it thrilled them to condescend to the average person every now and again, and
[01:40:33.737 --> 01:40:38.360]  Well, Ken, we've got Rockefeller telling Tony Gosling that, oh, we're not talking about anything serious in this meeting.
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:40.782]  No, just bicycle parts and stuff.
[01:40:56.687 --> 01:40:57.267]  Yeah.
[01:40:57.307 --> 01:41:07.310]  Well, he's admitting that they have exchanges about the state of the world, but what he's saying is that this is something that's got to be private.
[01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:20.173]  When you've got people that are so rich that they literally can start new countries, lend money to everybody that's on any side of a war, I mean, these people...
[01:41:22.925 --> 01:41:24.687]  Their power is so great.
[01:41:25.047 --> 01:41:29.410]  I don't even know that half the people at these Bilderberg meetings are even the upper echelon.
[01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:32.513]  I think they're just, you know, the... The gophers.
[01:41:32.613 --> 01:41:34.914]  Yeah, police generals and gophers, exactly.
[01:41:35.014 --> 01:41:37.756]  Was Henry Kissinger there, Tony?
[01:41:37.977 --> 01:41:39.438]  Yeah, he was, although I didn't see him.
[01:41:39.458 --> 01:41:44.682]  I had a definite confirmation from a very trusted source inside the hotel that he was definitely there.
[01:41:45.122 --> 01:41:47.264]  And what were some of the agendas they were discussing?
[01:41:47.624 --> 01:41:49.866]  Well, as I mentioned before, they had...
[01:41:52.556 --> 01:41:55.518]  They were talking about the European Army, and they were talking about Iraq.
[01:41:55.998 --> 01:42:00.460]  But, I mean, they have issued an agenda summary.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:20.909]  They say, and it usually is a pretty good indication of what's been being discussed, they say that they were looking at European-American relations, and in this context, Iraq, the Middle East after terrorism, non-proliferation, I mean, I would imagine that means North Korea, he says with a bit of a grim laugh,
[01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:36.306]  The European Convention, which of course, I don't know if Americans have been following this, but we have a convention at the moment over a constitution for Europe, is really making sure that the various European countries hand over sovereignty.
[01:42:36.386 --> 01:42:41.813]  And in the middle of this, we've got Rumsfeld and Pearl running around.
[01:42:42.731 --> 01:42:45.032]  Yeah, I have to say, I'm not actually sure about Rumsfeld.
[01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:47.292]  I'd heard he was there, but I didn't speak to anyone.
[01:42:47.312 --> 01:42:49.393]  Well, this is out of the Asia Times.
[01:42:49.953 --> 01:42:51.834]  Yeah, okay, well, I'm glad to hear it.
[01:42:51.854 --> 01:42:59.556]  We can start to piece together a participant list, even though we don't have it publicly, from little bits of information that come from here and there.
[01:42:59.596 --> 01:43:05.298]  But really, ultimately, we really should have an official list from the Bilderbergs, and they're refusing to let me have it this year.
[01:43:05.318 --> 01:43:07.539]  Who were the independent reporters that were there?
[01:43:07.619 --> 01:43:10.520]  Did you see this reporter from the Times of...
[01:43:12.201 --> 01:43:13.642]  No, didn't see him.
[01:43:13.682 --> 01:43:15.683]  There were people backwards and forwards the whole time.
[01:43:16.444 --> 01:43:22.909]  In fact, one of the things I'd love to say to your listeners is it actually is a really interesting thing to come and do.
[01:43:22.929 --> 01:43:33.137]  I mean, even just a few, you know, sort of a little break away from the United States, unless it's in the US, the Bilderbergers always meet in really palatial, lovely, plush surroundings.
[01:43:33.177 --> 01:43:33.998]  So it's a kind of a bit of a...
[01:43:34.698 --> 01:43:36.420]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:37.180]  Were you aware of that?
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:37.320]  Yeah.
[01:43:55.442 --> 01:43:56.043]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:43:56.083 --> 01:43:59.885]  I mean, I think it's also, you know, it's also possible for ordinary members of the public.
[01:43:59.905 --> 01:44:02.927]  Some Parisians turned up and were really helpful.
[01:44:03.128 --> 01:44:13.335]  For example, doing things like translating between people who were working in the hotel and the journalists so we could understand what they were saying because some of the staff of the hotel didn't speak English.
[01:44:14.295 --> 01:44:17.738]  And you get a kind of little collection of people at every Bilderberg conference.
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:26.629]  At least the ones that I've been to who are all kind of helping each other and it's really almost like an alternative conference in a way.
[01:44:27.230 --> 01:44:35.861]  We spent evenings in the hotel talking about September the 11th, comparing notes, really giving the BBC a hard time about their coverage of September the 11th, for example.
[01:44:36.701 --> 01:44:39.602]  And you end up with almost like an alternative conference at the venue.
[01:44:39.902 --> 01:44:40.362]  All right.
[01:44:40.422 --> 01:44:41.763]  All around the corner from the venue.
[01:44:41.803 --> 01:44:43.083]  Stay right there, Tony Gosselin.
[01:44:43.183 --> 01:44:44.023]  Thanks for the call, Ken.
[01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:47.985]  More calls coming up for our guests on the other side of this quick break at 800-259-9231.
[01:44:48.005 --> 01:44:52.486]  Tony Gosselin, Bilderberg.org.
[01:44:52.526 --> 01:44:53.806]  We really appreciate him coming on.
[01:44:53.826 --> 01:44:55.067]  We've got some more time with him.
[01:44:55.747 --> 01:44:56.567]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:44:56.647 --> 01:44:59.308]  My websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanted.com.
[01:44:59.348 --> 01:45:01.309]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:45:01.349 --> 01:45:01.829]  More coming up.
[01:45:01.849 --> 01:45:02.209]  Stay with us.
[01:45:04.105 --> 01:45:10.907]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:45:11.267 --> 01:45:12.627]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:45:12.827 --> 01:45:15.028]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:45:15.188 --> 01:45:17.268]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:45:17.549 --> 01:45:22.470]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:26.851]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:45:27.111 --> 01:45:27.732]  We're good to go.
[01:45:27.772 --> 01:45:29.093]  We're good to go.

[01:46:04.699 --> 01:46:09.204]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:46:09.544 --> 01:46:13.648]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:46:13.949 --> 01:46:14.489]  We listened.
[01:46:14.789 --> 01:46:19.795]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:46:20.055 --> 01:46:20.535]  We listened.
[01:46:20.936 --> 01:46:23.959]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:46:24.399 --> 01:46:24.900]  We listened.
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:29.443]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:46:29.823 --> 01:46:30.304]  We listened.
[01:46:30.644 --> 01:46:35.888]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:46:36.308 --> 01:46:37.649]  Again, we listened.
[01:46:38.029 --> 01:46:45.415]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:46:45.795 --> 01:46:49.738]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-888.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:47:10.567]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:47:10.787 --> 01:47:13.047]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[01:47:19.930 --> 01:47:20.591]  We're good to go.
[01:47:40.128 --> 01:47:40.668]  We're good to go.
[01:47:40.688 --> 01:47:41.429]  We're good to go.
[01:48:07.817 --> 01:48:09.498]  Folks, I've studied the Bilderberg Group.
[01:48:09.538 --> 01:48:10.438]  I know who goes to it.
[01:48:10.478 --> 01:48:11.419]  I know their path.
[01:48:11.619 --> 01:48:18.222]  Nazis, war criminals, international bankers, people that love Lenin and Stalin and Mao.
[01:48:18.842 --> 01:48:20.863]  I've read their quotes here that are public.
[01:48:21.744 --> 01:48:23.184]  They want to enslave you and your family.
[01:48:23.204 --> 01:48:24.885]  They're a bunch of degenerate control freaks.
[01:48:24.945 --> 01:48:26.346]  Maybe some of them aren't pure evil.
[01:48:26.386 --> 01:48:31.128]  Maybe the minions are presidents that go or presidential hopefuls that go to present themselves before them.
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:33.822]  Aren't pure evil, but once they get into this, they are.
[01:48:33.862 --> 01:48:34.322]  I'll say it.
[01:48:34.342 --> 01:48:35.063]  I'll tell it like it is.
[01:48:35.103 --> 01:48:36.404]  I've been to Bohemian Grove, folks.
[01:48:36.464 --> 01:48:38.365]  I've seen what they do, what they're about.
[01:48:38.385 --> 01:48:48.813]  We're talking to Tony Gosling, former BBC reporter, documentary producer, Bristol Branch union secretary, the National Union of Journalists.
[01:48:48.873 --> 01:48:50.434]  Joining us, his website's boulderberg.org.
[01:48:51.866 --> 01:48:57.530]  Be sure and visit InfoWars.com, folks, and get my new film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.

[01:48:58.950 --> 01:49:00.952]  It is two hours and 37 minutes long.
[01:49:00.972 --> 01:49:07.556]  You want to know what these people are really about, what their crimes are, the terror attacks that loveless carry out, and what they're going to give you in the future.

[01:49:42.039 --> 01:49:48.703]  Again, 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or net.
[01:49:48.723 --> 01:49:50.744]  And I really enjoyed having Tony Gosselin on.
[01:49:50.764 --> 01:49:51.805]  He'll be on with us a little bit.
[01:49:52.225 --> 01:49:53.026]  Into the next hour.
[01:49:53.046 --> 01:49:55.268]  Pam in Missouri, you're on with our guest.
[01:49:55.308 --> 01:49:55.789]  Go ahead.
[01:49:56.609 --> 01:49:57.290]  Hello, Alex.
[01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:58.091]  Hello, Pam.
[01:49:58.531 --> 01:49:59.652]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:49:59.853 --> 01:50:02.635]  I just had to tell Mr. Gosling, is that it?
[01:50:03.556 --> 01:50:08.941]  He sounds like he really enjoys being with these people and et cetera, et cetera.
[01:50:08.961 --> 01:50:13.406]  I just have to tell him I wouldn't let these people in my home.
[01:50:14.878 --> 01:50:16.819]  I wouldn't let them in my home either.
[01:50:16.859 --> 01:50:20.120]  Hold on guys, we're talking over each other.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.921]  Hold on a second.
[01:50:22.241 --> 01:50:23.202]  Can I just answer that?
[01:50:23.222 --> 01:50:24.182]  Let me just say this.
[01:50:24.562 --> 01:50:26.323]  He is a gentleman, you know, he is from England.
[01:50:26.363 --> 01:50:26.883]  Go ahead.
[01:50:27.203 --> 01:50:31.185]  What I enjoy is the company of the other people who are also covering Bilderberg.
[01:50:31.645 --> 01:50:35.207]  I don't actually see anybody in the conference really hardly at all.
[01:50:35.387 --> 01:50:37.208]  We were very lucky on the Saturday.
[01:50:37.768 --> 01:50:43.653]  But, you know, it's really an experience of a bit of real journalism.
[01:50:43.673 --> 01:50:45.275]  She may have misunderstood you.
[01:50:45.295 --> 01:50:48.457]  You better be careful because they sure can deceive you.
[01:50:49.118 --> 01:50:50.139]  And give them a message.
[01:50:50.199 --> 01:50:52.401]  They better read Zephaniah Chapter 1.
[01:50:53.742 --> 01:50:54.122]  Okay?
[01:50:54.542 --> 01:50:54.803]  Yeah.
[01:50:54.963 --> 01:50:55.543]  Thank you.
[01:50:55.583 --> 01:50:55.923]  Thank you.
[01:50:55.984 --> 01:51:01.688]  I think Pam listening may have heard you talk about the other conference and thought that she may have misheard or something, Tony.
[01:51:02.919 --> 01:51:03.700]  Well, that's okay.
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:23.540]  It's just that, you know, I mean, I don't go along there just to... I think it is interesting when you go to these meetings of people who are so incredibly powerful, and they are very powerful, very rich people, that, you know, you do feel that the money also comes with the money a great deal of embarrassment because they have to hide all the time.
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:23.901]  They kind of...
[01:51:24.501 --> 01:51:25.042]  We're good to go.
[01:51:25.082 --> 01:51:25.662]  We're good to go.
[01:51:42.194 --> 01:51:51.177]  Because I think one thing that always happens is that you get the kind of mixture of really wild conspiracy theory with fact, which then completely discredits the Bilderberg.
[01:51:51.197 --> 01:52:01.381]  And one of the reasons why mainstream journalists, you're talking about people writing for the Independent in this country, BBC people, etc., stay well clear of it when there's all this kind of crazy conspiracy theory as well.
[01:52:02.305 --> 01:52:05.386]  Well, I mean, there's no crazy conspiracy theory about David Rockefeller.
[01:52:05.446 --> 01:52:07.127]  I'm talking about lizards.
[01:52:07.167 --> 01:52:12.529]  People seriously, you know, David Icke, for example, is seriously going around saying these people are lizards, which is, you know, it doesn't really help matters.
[01:52:13.069 --> 01:52:18.091]  Well, yeah, what that does is it then discredits the whole, and I see what you're talking about there, Tony.
[01:52:19.131 --> 01:52:20.573]  We've only got one more segment with you.
[01:52:20.633 --> 01:52:27.019]  I want to, when we get back, I want to talk about, did Jim Tucker, he's coming on tomorrow, but did Jim give you any scoops that he got that you didn't get?
[01:52:27.039 --> 01:52:30.343]  He's very generous, Jim.
[01:52:30.383 --> 01:52:34.888]  He makes sure that each evening in the hotel, we all sit down and share information together.
[01:52:35.428 --> 01:52:37.330]  So we know what's going on with Jim.
[01:52:37.570 --> 01:52:43.094]  Well, I want to find out some of the things you learned from him and other journalists that were there and who some of the other folks that were there were.
[01:52:43.134 --> 01:52:44.275]  We haven't gotten to that point yet.
[01:52:44.775 --> 01:52:45.436]  One minute break.
[01:52:45.456 --> 01:52:46.977]  We'll be back with the third and final hour.
[01:52:47.057 --> 01:52:50.099]  I've got a bunch of news after our guest leaves us and your calls.
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:51.140]  So stay with us.
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:52.081]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:52:54.059 --> 01:52:54.800]  Are you prepared?
[01:52:55.001 --> 01:52:57.404]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[01:52:57.624 --> 01:53:02.050]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[01:53:02.351 --> 01:53:05.115]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our aglity.
[01:53:07.878 --> 01:53:11.043]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.668 --> 01:53:20.308]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.989 --> 01:53:22.009]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.750 --> 01:53:23.830]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:25.331]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.071 --> 01:53:26.972]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.992 --> 01:53:31.394]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.835 --> 01:53:35.937]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.918 --> 01:53:41.360]  Already in the third and final hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:42.640]  More of your calls coming up.
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:45.382]  We've been talking about the Bilderberg Group for much of the last hour.
[01:53:46.585 --> 01:53:48.527]  With Tony Gosselin for years.
[01:53:48.547 --> 01:53:51.149]  He's been covering Bilderberg, but he's been to several other conferences.
[01:53:51.189 --> 01:54:00.116]  He just got back from Versailles, France, and has been giving us a lot of interesting information from in and around the organization.
[01:54:00.156 --> 01:54:03.499]  Coming up, more on the bombings in Turkey and at Yale.
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:08.923]  Out in Connecticut, we'll talk about the mad cow situation up in Canada.
[01:54:08.963 --> 01:54:12.846]  We'll talk about the military on highest domestic terror threat alert here domestically.
[01:54:12.886 --> 01:54:14.107]  A quake kills more than 640 in Algeria.
[01:54:16.696 --> 01:54:22.445]  We'll get into some of the police state news and how the allies begin seizing weapons from most Iraqis, something Saddam didn't do.
[01:54:23.283 --> 01:54:26.584]  Tony Gosselin is our last segment with you, and I appreciate you with us in the last hour.
[01:54:26.604 --> 01:54:35.667]  Any other key areas you want to hit on, and who were some of the other journalists who were there, and what are some other tidbits of info you have for us from in and around the Bilderberg Group meeting?
[01:54:36.287 --> 01:54:47.070]  Well, the other journalists who were covering the conference were, there was a newspaper from Norway, but the one thing that is common between all of the journalists there is they're all from independence.
[01:54:47.090 --> 01:54:48.711]  It's funny, because whenever someone turns up,
[01:54:49.872 --> 01:54:52.634]  We always quiz them, almost knowing what the answer's going to be.
[01:54:52.655 --> 01:54:54.556]  You know, say, oh, who owns your newspaper?
[01:54:54.576 --> 01:54:56.057]  And sometimes they have to think twice, even.
[01:54:56.097 --> 01:54:57.858]  You know, oh, it's owned by this guy or this guy.
[01:54:58.459 --> 01:55:07.265]  And, of course, it's always either kind of rich entrepreneurs that have started their own newspaper or else their own radio station or whatever that cover it.
[01:55:07.325 --> 01:55:12.309]  So there's never anyone from any of the main networks of television, radio.
[01:55:12.369 --> 01:55:18.294]  But we were very lucky, I think, this time to have the BBC along because it seems like they're going to be doing something which is reasonably critical.
[01:55:20.015 --> 01:55:41.856]  You know, at least taking some of the critical... For example, the fact that the Bilderberg was started by a card-carrying member of Hitler's SS is a point that often doesn't get dealt with in mainstream articles, so I'm really hoping the BBC are going to look at that and question the Bilderberg on it, because they have had interviews with some of the top Bilderberg people, like Martin Taylor, for example.
[01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:46.417]  Interestingly enough, I just got a profile of Martin Taylor.
[01:55:46.918 --> 01:55:50.204]  He's the ex-head of Barclays Bank, now running several companies in Britain.
[01:55:50.985 --> 01:55:52.909]  And it turns out...
[01:55:54.068 --> 01:56:04.636]  That he also has a non-executive directorship of quite a nasty looking genetics company which is doing personalised medicine.
[01:56:04.936 --> 01:56:14.483]  So basically they take your blood, they examine your genes, pull your genes apart, decide what they think is wrong and design a special, very expensive pill for you to take that's going to cure you.
[01:56:14.503 --> 01:56:17.265]  These are the kind of things, business interests that they're into and we were joking
[01:56:17.665 --> 01:56:17.965]  It's amazing.
[01:56:18.025 --> 01:56:24.710]  And you take all these powerful people, duchesses and dukes and kings and queens and bankers and presidents and prime ministers and defense secretaries...
[01:56:43.863 --> 01:56:48.045]  And you put them all together, combining their power, it's just incredible.
[01:56:48.065 --> 01:56:52.708]  And, of course, they all scratch each other's backs and are bringing us this world government.
[01:56:52.748 --> 01:56:53.568]  That's obvious.
[01:56:53.608 --> 01:56:58.231]  They promote globalism and getting rid of our national sovereignty.
[01:56:58.271 --> 01:57:05.615]  But, unfortunately, the mainstream talk show hosts out there like Neil Bortz and others don't talk about these subjects.
[01:57:06.055 --> 01:57:13.079]  It's all left-wing, right-wing when both the left and the right are controlled by these same organizations, these same people.
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:31.015]  Well, it is also interesting that some of the journalists are left-wing journalists and some are right-wing journalists, and yet we all seem to be quite happily able to get along fine and share information, because we find that although, you know, maybe we're taking a left-wing or a right-wing slant on events, if you want to use those terms,
[01:57:31.676 --> 01:57:31.936]  Absolutely.
[01:57:32.056 --> 01:57:33.037]  Listen, I've got to let you go.
[01:57:33.057 --> 01:57:36.240]  Tony Gosling, I really appreciate you coming on the show.
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:37.441]  We'll talk to you in the future.
[01:57:37.461 --> 01:57:38.161]  Okay, nice one, Alex.
[01:57:56.856 --> 01:57:57.516]  Take care, sir.
[01:57:57.536 --> 01:58:00.158]  Really do appreciate you joining us on the show today.
[01:58:00.418 --> 01:58:01.698]  We'll be back, folks.
[01:58:01.738 --> 01:58:05.600]  Got a lot of other news and information to cover here on the show.
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:07.721]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:08.342 --> 01:58:12.944]  And again, the websites are infowars.com, infowars.net, and prisonplanet.com.
[01:58:12.964 --> 01:58:13.324]  Stay with us.
[01:58:15.948 --> 01:58:23.337]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:58:23.618 --> 01:58:28.364]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:58:28.584 --> 01:58:34.231]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:58:34.451 --> 01:58:35.172]  We're good to go.
[01:58:50.708 --> 01:58:50.968]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:59:14.688 --> 01:59:22.952]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:59:23.192 --> 01:59:27.553]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:59:27.854 --> 01:59:36.757]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:59:36.957 --> 01:59:40.579]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:59:40.879 --> 01:59:45.904]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:59:46.204 --> 01:59:52.951]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:59:53.411 --> 01:59:53.972]  What about you?
[01:59:54.711 --> 02:00:00.074]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:00:00.114 --> 02:00:01.214]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:00:01.294 --> 02:00:03.135]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:00:03.195 --> 02:00:03.695]  Are you prepared?
[02:00:03.715 --> 02:00:05.796]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[02:00:17.802 --> 02:00:22.225]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[02:00:22.525 --> 02:00:25.987]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[02:00:26.207 --> 02:00:28.388]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:33.071]  Jerry Guidetti from the ARC Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[02:00:33.311 --> 02:00:36.253]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[02:00:36.373 --> 02:00:37.614]  Call the ARC Institute today.
[02:00:37.794 --> 02:00:43.436]  At 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[02:00:43.656 --> 02:00:48.957]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[02:00:49.217 --> 02:00:54.239]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[02:00:54.459 --> 02:00:55.559]  Jerry can help here, too.
[02:00:55.759 --> 02:01:00.981]  The book, Surviving a Bioterrorist Attack, will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[02:01:01.221 --> 02:01:05.082]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[02:01:05.262 --> 02:01:06.523]  Call the ARC Institute today.
[02:01:06.643 --> 02:01:08.884]  Toll free.
[02:01:08.904 --> 02:01:09.405]  1-800-255-1912.

[02:01:14.908 --> 02:01:19.952]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:20.312 --> 02:01:22.613]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:30.572 --> 02:01:30.992]  We're good to go.
[02:01:54.864 --> 02:01:57.306]  All right, folks, we're on the air.
[02:01:57.367 --> 02:02:00.009]  I'm Alex Jones, already into the third and final hour.
[02:02:00.049 --> 02:02:02.111]  We will take more calls in this hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:02.371 --> 02:02:02.611]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:02:11.489 --> 02:02:12.790]  We're good to go.
[02:02:12.811 --> 02:02:12.971]  I think?
[02:02:35.571 --> 02:02:37.973]  Basically is the whole line that we're seeing.
[02:02:38.453 --> 02:02:41.535]  World is shunning Canadian beef over mad cow fears.
[02:02:42.496 --> 02:02:58.247]  Reuters reporting the world has slammed the door on Canadian beef and cattle Wednesday fearing a mad cow disease outbreak as inspectors sealed off more farms while racing to trace the origin of the animal confirmed as the country's first case in a decade.
[02:02:58.707 --> 02:03:09.792]  The United States was first to slap a temporary ban on shipments from Canada after a cow from Alberta, the country's top bee-producing province, was confirmed as having a brain-wasting disease Tuesday.
[02:03:10.292 --> 02:03:20.316]  Other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and Mexico, have quickly followed suit, forcing Alberta's $3 billion cattle-a-year industry to grind nearly to a halt.
[02:03:20.356 --> 02:03:21.277]  We're good to go.
[02:03:41.054 --> 02:03:45.236]  Folks, there's no way to avoid beef products unless you grow it yourself or I guess go to a health food store.
[02:04:04.548 --> 02:04:07.690]  The capsules around pills in many cases are made out of it.
[02:04:08.410 --> 02:04:10.571]  It's in thousands of products.
[02:04:10.631 --> 02:04:11.751]  It's all over the place.
[02:04:11.831 --> 02:04:13.032]  It's in dog food.
[02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:14.293]  It's everywhere.
[02:04:15.313 --> 02:04:23.897]  And it's not bad enough that the government has allowed people to feed meat products, byproducts to cows and sheep and creatures that don't eat meat, herbivores.
[02:04:25.138 --> 02:04:31.961]  Now they're feeding rotten meat products full of toxins and chemicals that then lodge in the brain and grow crystals.
[02:04:32.688 --> 02:04:34.268]  And the globalists have allowed this to happen.
[02:04:34.288 --> 02:04:35.409]  They've done nothing to stop it.
[02:04:35.789 --> 02:04:36.969]  They want this to spread.
[02:04:36.989 --> 02:04:38.529]  It will shut down farms and ranches.
[02:04:38.549 --> 02:04:41.310]  It will bring in incredible federal regulation and control.
[02:04:41.690 --> 02:04:42.510]  How do we know this?
[02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:53.512]  We saw the example three, four years ago over in the United Kingdom when foot-and-mouth disease got released by hoarding down bioweapons laboratories.
[02:04:53.532 --> 02:04:54.733]  This was admitted mainstream news.
[02:04:55.193 --> 02:04:56.673]  Ananova, Sky News.
[02:04:57.638 --> 02:04:59.319]  Sunday Herald, they all reported on it.
[02:04:59.839 --> 02:05:10.843]  It got released, and the government, two months before it got released, told the different farming bureaus, prepare with mass pyres, mass wood, to burn animals.
[02:05:11.723 --> 02:05:17.245]  Simultaneously showed up from Scotland to Wales to Northern Ireland in a week's space.
[02:05:17.685 --> 02:05:23.167]  They killed 4 million cows, 8 million sheep, and I predicted, it's not hard to do when you understand the globalist paradigm,
[02:05:24.569 --> 02:05:32.914]  I predicted that the globalists would move and move hard to say, okay, you can't restock your cows and sheep.
[02:05:33.374 --> 02:05:40.379]  And a year later, the head of the environmental group there at the Bureau in the British government said, you can't restock your cows and sheep.
[02:05:40.799 --> 02:05:45.782]  You can't farm anymore because the runoff of their hooves into the streams hurts the environment.
[02:05:45.802 --> 02:05:51.105]  Their flatulence causes a greenhouse effect, which is just ridiculous news.
[02:05:52.454 --> 02:05:54.696]  And so we're not going to let you restock them.
[02:05:54.856 --> 02:05:57.318]  And so they're forcing people off their ancestral lands.
[02:05:57.738 --> 02:06:02.823]  It's all about getting you into compact cities where you can be totally and completely controlled.
[02:06:03.703 --> 02:06:10.709]  And then I saw a story two years ago where it was first in the Pioneer Press out of Minnesota, then we saw it in Virginia, other areas.
[02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:16.655]  They said, if foot and mouth is released, we're going to shut down all the farms and ranches, period.
[02:06:16.675 --> 02:06:18.216]  30 states passed laws to do it.
[02:06:19.139 --> 02:06:22.460]  The Army's going to bring food to the ranchers' and farmers' homes.
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:24.120]  You can't leave your house.
[02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:26.241]  And they're going to start mass culling here.
[02:06:28.002 --> 02:06:30.622]  Now, foot and mouth is no problem with range-fed cattle.
[02:06:31.002 --> 02:06:33.803]  It's the most profitable type as well because you just put them out on your land.
[02:06:33.823 --> 02:06:34.563]  They eat the grass.
[02:06:34.603 --> 02:06:39.885]  Maybe in the winter you give them some supplemental range cubes, some feed, some alfalfa.
[02:06:40.643 --> 02:06:45.194]  You put out a salt lick for them to get to key minerals if there's not natural salt licks in the area.
[02:06:45.635 --> 02:06:47.920]  It's how you pay your outrageous property taxes.
[02:06:48.461 --> 02:06:50.446]  It's how you hold on to your land.
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:56.482]  Believe me, you've got to be independently wealthy to own land, or it's a subsistence situation.
[02:06:57.022 --> 02:07:01.383]  We own a lot of land in East Texas, and it's a bottle each year to pay the property taxes.
[02:07:01.403 --> 02:07:06.665]  We do that with deer hunting revenue and the cows, and it barely pays the bill.
[02:07:06.685 --> 02:07:10.766]  The land is frankly a liability because of the outrageous property taxes.
[02:07:11.226 --> 02:07:19.629]  If there is a foot-and-mouth outbreak or spongy form of cephalopathy or mad cow in these cows,
[02:07:20.804 --> 02:07:28.987]  If it happens, even on feedlots in Canada or Illinois or wherever, it is going to smash the beef industry for a long time.
[02:07:29.387 --> 02:07:31.167]  A lot of people aren't going to be able to hold on.
[02:07:31.347 --> 02:07:32.367]  I am very angry.
[02:07:32.387 --> 02:07:35.969]  I don't want to hear ranchers going, don't talk about this, it will hurt us.
[02:07:36.749 --> 02:07:42.090]  Not talking about it is going to kill Americans and going to make it bigger and be a bigger disaster in the future.
[02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:47.772]  We have got to talk about it and talk about how the culprits, the government allowing this, have caused this problem.
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:56.384]  By the way, there's a giant plant in Florida where they feed, where they grind up dead cats and dogs that have been euthanized and put it back into dog food.
[02:07:56.704 --> 02:07:59.025]  That's causing mad cow in your dogs and cats.
[02:08:00.165 --> 02:08:02.266]  It has got to stop, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:03.047 --> 02:08:10.150]  We've got to stop feeding rotten animals to other animals, especially herbivores, creatures that only eat plant life.
[02:08:11.227 --> 02:08:14.069]  It is so important we stop the craziness.
[02:08:14.109 --> 02:08:19.751]  But all this mad cow and all this foot and mouth, released by a bioweapons lab, porting down is nothing!
[02:08:21.632 --> 02:08:22.273]  Nothing!
[02:08:23.433 --> 02:08:24.114]  Zero!
[02:08:25.854 --> 02:08:32.798]  Not a zip compared to what we're looking at and what we're facing today.
[02:08:33.792 --> 02:08:47.205]  The situation that we're dealing with, with companies like Texas company ProteGene that engineered the AIDS virus into the corn, 96 locations, FDA authorized it, it spread into soybean crops, that's mainstream news.
[02:08:47.265 --> 02:08:50.628]  It's so insane, I feel like a liar when I say it.
[02:08:53.098 --> 02:08:57.861]  I feel like a liar when I say it, though I've got the AP report that no one ever seemed to saw.
[02:08:57.901 --> 02:08:58.921]  It was never in a newspaper.
[02:08:59.441 --> 02:09:01.383]  We've got goats being spliced with spiders.
[02:09:01.403 --> 02:09:03.624]  We've got cockroach genes going into tomatoes and corn.
[02:09:03.924 --> 02:09:05.185]  Salmon genes going into corn.
[02:09:05.565 --> 02:09:07.066]  Human genes going into pigs.
[02:09:07.166 --> 02:09:07.946]  It's nuts!
[02:09:09.227 --> 02:09:16.210]  And no wonder we've got all these bizarre flesh-eating bacteria popping up and weird SARS viruses and all these spinoffs from genetic engineering.
[02:09:16.230 --> 02:09:20.733]  If it's not on purpose, they've allowed it to happen in an insanely reckless fashion.
[02:09:21.954 --> 02:09:22.254]  I don't know.
[02:09:22.274 --> 02:09:24.355]  What do you think about genetic engineering run wild?
[02:09:25.175 --> 02:09:31.478]  Africa figured it out and has refused all of this so-called food aid that's genetically engineered massively.
[02:09:31.838 --> 02:09:33.059]  What are we going to figure it out?
[02:09:33.099 --> 02:09:36.821]  What are we going to figure out what they're doing to us with these vaccines and all this trash?
[02:09:38.201 --> 02:09:42.263]  We've got to expose how evil and corrupt the globalists are, and we've got to do it now.
[02:09:43.254 --> 02:09:45.555]  Military on highest domestic terror threat alert.
[02:09:46.035 --> 02:09:46.316]  The U.S.
[02:09:46.356 --> 02:09:52.999]  Defense Intelligence Agency has raised its warnings of a possible terror attack against military facilities in the United States to its highest level.
[02:09:53.319 --> 02:10:03.424]  Defense officials said on Wednesday, responding to the charge that the threat from significant to high, the military will deploy additional mobile anti-aircraft missile systems.
[02:10:03.804 --> 02:10:08.307]  ...and increased air patrols in Washington area, according to officials who asked not to be identified.
[02:10:08.327 --> 02:10:12.349]  The DIA warnings were issued late on Tuesday as the U.S.
[02:10:12.369 --> 02:10:21.874]  government raised its general terror alert status to the second highest level, citing the risk of attacks on the American soil in light of recent suicide bombings in Morocco and Saudi Arabia.
[02:10:22.495 --> 02:10:31.480]  Pentagon said it was up to regional and base commanders to decide what protective level to set for the facilities, but level remained at Charlie at the Pentagon, one below...
[02:10:32.885 --> 02:10:34.485]  We're the highest of the four levels.
[02:10:35.986 --> 02:10:44.307]  The defense official said in addition to increasing patrols by fighter jets over Washington, the military would deploy additional anti-aircraft missiles on the ground.
[02:10:44.707 --> 02:10:51.889]  They would include Avenger packages of lightweight Stinger missiles mounted on Humvee military vehicles.
[02:10:51.929 --> 02:10:53.789]  You know, they had this already in Washington.
[02:10:54.829 --> 02:10:56.489]  They already have Stingers on top of the Capitol.
[02:10:56.529 --> 02:10:59.490]  I've seen images on the news where there's a guy on the roof with a Stinger before.
[02:11:00.274 --> 02:11:00.434]  I think?
[02:11:25.948 --> 02:11:27.372]  White kills more than 640 in Algeria.
[02:11:27.392 --> 02:11:28.876]  Nearly 5,000 reported injured.
[02:11:28.956 --> 02:11:30.339]  The 6.7 government officials say.
[02:11:36.013 --> 02:11:40.657]  Powerful earthquake that struck northern Algeria, killed at least 640 people and injured 5,000 others.
[02:11:40.778 --> 02:11:49.626]  The government said Thursday among the areas hardest hit was the city of Rabouia, or Rabouia, I pronounced that right, to the east of the capital, Algiers.
[02:11:50.146 --> 02:11:54.050]  The quake had a magnitude of 6.7 on the open, ended Richter scale.
[02:11:54.230 --> 02:11:54.410]  U.S.
[02:11:54.510 --> 02:12:01.637]  experts said the quake sent panicked families running into the streets of Algiers where buildings in some districts were damaged.
[02:12:02.927 --> 02:12:05.649]  The tremor hit a 7.44 p.m.
[02:12:05.709 --> 02:12:06.170]  Wednesday.
[02:12:07.150 --> 02:12:08.171]  It goes on and on.
[02:12:08.732 --> 02:12:14.797]  Also, Tarrytown judge remarks sparks outrage just to show the Nazi-like mentality.
[02:12:15.657 --> 02:12:21.402]  An Arab-American woman who fainted in a village court said she suffered an anxiety attack under the judge as if she were a terrorist.
[02:12:21.562 --> 02:12:23.383]  You know, they're telling these folks they'll get in prison for life.
[02:12:23.403 --> 02:12:24.064]  No wonder she fainted.
[02:12:24.841 --> 02:12:33.126]  Anassa Colder has filed a complaint against Tarrytown Village Justice William Crosby with the State Commission of Judicial Conduct.
[02:12:33.727 --> 02:12:37.569]  Colder went to court on Thursday to contest a pair of parking tickets.
[02:12:37.609 --> 02:12:43.433]  As she approached the judge's table, she said Crosby considered her name and out loud and asked if she were a terrorist.
[02:12:43.833 --> 02:12:49.296]  She said she was stunned by the implication and responded with a weak, reflexive smile.
[02:12:50.938 --> 02:12:51.438]  Unbelievable.
[02:12:52.661 --> 02:12:58.123]  And now the Deputy State Attorney General in California says protesting a war will be a terrorist act.
[02:12:58.143 --> 02:13:00.684]  Because that age terrorist, that might be illegal.
[02:13:00.724 --> 02:13:03.466]  And he goes on to say, terrorism isn't something violent.
[02:13:03.826 --> 02:13:06.207]  It's something that blocks commerce or stops the war.
[02:13:07.007 --> 02:13:08.408]  That's the liberals doing that.
[02:13:08.448 --> 02:13:09.208]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:17.451]  Your beliefs and opinions are attacked constantly.
[02:13:17.591 --> 02:13:21.594]  Media, press, and government support, even perpetrate lies to degrade your rights and independence.
[02:13:21.834 --> 02:13:25.516]  The liberally biased populace assaults your mind in order to take advantage of your soul.
[02:13:25.776 --> 02:13:30.639]  Fight back every day with the 2003 Freedom Calendar, available by calling Midas Resources at 1-800-722-4222.
[02:13:31.499 --> 02:13:34.600]  The rights that will save you from a corrupted republic.
[02:13:51.567 --> 02:13:52.788]  We want you to spread the word.
[02:13:53.009 --> 02:13:55.772]  Prices decrease significantly when the quantity ordered is increased.
[02:13:55.972 --> 02:13:56.492]  Call now.
[02:13:56.512 --> 02:13:57.033]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:13:57.093 --> 02:14:00.977]  Unity is the only way to overcome.
[02:14:01.197 --> 02:14:02.779]  Know your rights granted by God.
[02:14:03.059 --> 02:14:05.502]  The very rights our government was created to protect.
[02:14:05.642 --> 02:14:08.285]  The Freedom Calendar is available now at Midas Resources.
[02:14:08.305 --> 02:14:08.565]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:14:08.585 --> 02:14:10.387]  Get it now and start spreading the truth.
[02:14:16.593 --> 02:14:21.077]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:14:21.437 --> 02:14:25.541]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:14:25.821 --> 02:14:26.362]  We listened.
[02:14:26.682 --> 02:14:31.666]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:14:31.947 --> 02:14:32.427]  We listened.
[02:14:32.807 --> 02:14:35.850]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:36.791]  We listened.
[02:14:37.251 --> 02:14:41.315]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:14:41.715 --> 02:14:42.196]  We listened.
[02:14:42.536 --> 02:14:47.781]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:14:48.181 --> 02:14:49.542]  Again, we listened.
[02:14:49.922 --> 02:14:57.289]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:14:57.689 --> 02:15:01.833]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 8887.

[02:15:14.958 --> 02:15:25.105]  My husband has been on Vim and Vigor for four months, and he has lost 33 pounds, and I have lost 36 pounds, and I'm just thrilled to death about this.
[02:15:25.485 --> 02:15:28.567]  With collagenase from Vim and Vigor, I've lost 20 pounds.
[02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:32.350]  My cholesterol went from 206 to 131.
[02:15:32.730 --> 02:15:36.452]  My body fat's down by 10%, and that's been in two months, and I feel great.
[02:15:36.612 --> 02:15:39.674]  I've been a fitness expert for 20 years.
[02:15:40.015 --> 02:15:41.956]  I've never endorsed anything.
[02:15:42.036 --> 02:15:43.477]  I've never pushed anything.
[02:15:43.877 --> 02:15:44.278]  Call right now.
[02:15:58.712 --> 02:16:02.453]  1-800-622-THIN That's 1-800-622-THIN Remember, $25 off a three-month supply, but you've got to call Vim and Vigor now.
[02:16:02.473 --> 02:16:04.074]  1-800-622-THIN Hey, that's 1-800-622-8446
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:20.023]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[02:16:20.183 --> 02:16:24.567]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:16:24.767 --> 02:16:29.211]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[02:16:29.391 --> 02:16:32.373]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.

[02:16:41.681 --> 02:16:44.083]  And the Aaronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[02:16:44.363 --> 02:16:48.267]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[02:16:48.487 --> 02:16:53.691]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds, and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.

[02:16:56.994 --> 02:16:58.876]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[02:16:59.056 --> 02:17:01.738]  For more information about the Aaronizer, call toll-free.
[02:17:01.978 --> 02:17:03.700]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis Food.
[02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:05.642]  The toll free number to call is 877-605-9200 That's 877-605-9200
[02:17:37.099 --> 02:17:38.260]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:39.241]  Let's go to some calls.
[02:17:39.361 --> 02:17:40.322]  Wyatt, Maryland.
[02:17:40.382 --> 02:17:41.303]  Wyatt, you're on the air.
[02:17:41.343 --> 02:17:41.984]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:17:42.344 --> 02:17:43.025]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:17:43.225 --> 02:17:43.706]  How you doing?
[02:17:44.026 --> 02:17:44.607]  Good, good.
[02:17:45.668 --> 02:17:55.579]  Boy, there's so much to talk about, and there's a little time, but all I can say is the demons are loose, and they're out, and they're doing the work.
[02:17:57.355 --> 02:18:17.106]  You know, you're talking about... One topic here, a local man in Baltimore area, he was having trouble with his teenagers running up, and he's a father, you know, husband, father, and he's been having an ongoing dispute between the teenagers running up and down the street with their cars, speeding up and down, because their children are playing in the area.
[02:18:17.146 --> 02:18:22.108]  And I don't know what remedies he sought, but what he did do is he grabbed one of them and...
[02:18:23.388 --> 02:18:27.852]  And either smack the heck out of him or beat him up.
[02:18:27.912 --> 02:18:33.517]  But, of course, he was charged with assault, but he was also charged with a terrorist act.
[02:18:34.421 --> 02:18:34.961]  Oh, yeah.
[02:18:35.041 --> 02:18:36.962]  They've said everything's going to be terrorism now.
[02:18:37.042 --> 02:18:39.283]  No rights under the terrorist designation.
[02:18:39.343 --> 02:18:44.345]  And you've had all your urban warfare takeovers up there in your neck of the woods.
[02:18:44.385 --> 02:18:50.107]  What about in New York where they bust in the old city worker's house with a no-knock search warrant?
[02:18:50.127 --> 02:18:51.207]  She dies of a heart attack.
[02:18:51.267 --> 02:18:52.408]  I mean, it's just out of control.
[02:18:52.728 --> 02:18:53.468]  Oh, it certainly is.
[02:18:53.888 --> 02:18:56.069]  And I was listening to your first hour.
[02:18:56.109 --> 02:18:57.050]  It wasn't broadcast.
[02:18:57.150 --> 02:19:00.691]  I turned on where I listen to at WPOC at Silver Spring.
[02:19:01.340 --> 02:19:06.921]  I was listening to C-SPAN Radio, and they've gotten a commission together, ha-ha, on 9-11.
[02:19:07.501 --> 02:19:14.303]  And it was Lee Hamilton and Governor Kaine from New Jersey.
[02:19:15.023 --> 02:19:22.505]  And one good thing is they took calls, and every caller, Alex, every caller that called in,
[02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:25.012]  They must have seen your tape.
[02:19:25.132 --> 02:19:40.946]  They must be listening to you, buddy, because everyone was bringing up topics of controversy about the activities surrounding 9-11 and that they're not coming out with the truth, and people were saying, you guys are on accounts on foreign relations, and how can you be independent?
[02:19:41.487 --> 02:19:44.630]  It was absolutely terrific, and I'm sure it'll be rebroadcast
[02:19:45.234 --> 02:19:49.980]  Well, let me just tell the establishment this.
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:51.401]  They can try to shut us down.
[02:19:51.802 --> 02:19:53.183]  They can try to buy stations up.
[02:19:53.264 --> 02:19:54.765]  They can try all their little scams.
[02:19:55.326 --> 02:20:00.472]  I want the listeners, all of you, to make 100 copies of 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:20:00.892 --> 02:20:15.761]  And get them to sheriffs and police and talk show hosts and mayors and preachers, and a large percent are waking up and getting involved, and you tell them to make copies, and thousands of tapes turn into millions of tapes, millions of tapes turn into hundreds of millions of tapes.
[02:20:16.161 --> 02:20:21.845]  We can do it, and if we don't, the globalists are going to continue to carry out terror, to blame it on their political enemies.
[02:20:22.105 --> 02:20:27.148]  This is life or death for this country, and we're going to win this fight, bottom line, Wyatt.
[02:20:27.568 --> 02:20:27.788]  Right.
[02:20:28.148 --> 02:20:28.729]  One other thing...
[02:20:29.889 --> 02:20:32.530]  Back about five years ago, my uncle was killed.
[02:20:33.490 --> 02:20:46.534]  He was given a bad cow disease, which they called Jakob-Kruchfeld disease, which is attributed to two doctors named Jakob and Kruchfeld, who discovered brain stem encephalitis in sheep in the 20s.
[02:20:47.294 --> 02:20:55.716]  And he was a former CIA, which are never really former, but what he was doing was he was picking up information from the inside
[02:20:56.974 --> 02:21:09.760]  Dropped off in lockers at the airport or dumpsters around, and he was picking this information up, and he was leaking it to probably like the American Free Press, which was the spotlight, and some other activities.
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:18.644]  And so he went into the Veterans Hospital here in Baltimore, Maryland, for a knee operation and came out with bad cow disease.
[02:21:19.144 --> 02:21:21.165]  And he lived for about six months.
[02:21:21.945 --> 02:21:28.070]  And they wouldn't do a biopsy on him because they said it was too dangerous to find out what he had, but they did what he had.
[02:21:29.051 --> 02:21:33.054]  They misplaced all of his medical files that was hand-carried by his wife.
[02:21:33.314 --> 02:21:43.061]  Well, I've heard from a lot of people who were former CIA that when you go in for surgery, they implant this, and you have heard that from another prominent person I can't tell you about.
[02:21:43.101 --> 02:21:44.102]  That's very possible.
[02:21:44.122 --> 02:21:44.862]  That's very possible.
[02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:47.985]  Or they just gave it to him while he was in there, or it was activated.
[02:21:49.065 --> 02:21:53.627]  But they just did away with him, and it was a terrible thing.
[02:21:54.327 --> 02:22:11.632]  At the funeral, afterwards, when we went to the house, I talked to his daughters and his children, and I asked them, I said, don't be surprised if strangers, you get strange phone calls, if people from out of the way come by your place and say, hey, I was with your father in Vietnam.
[02:22:12.112 --> 02:22:22.202]  Or blah, blah, blah, because they did not advertise the, did not put the obituary in the newspaper, and yet they had people watching their house in white vans, and they live in the country, Alex.
[02:22:22.242 --> 02:22:26.806]  They live on the eastern shore of Maryland, which is a, I mean, there's only a few, you know all your neighbors.
[02:22:27.362 --> 02:22:30.446]  And people came to their house, strangers.
[02:22:30.506 --> 02:22:32.728]  Well, this is what the wondrous America is about.
[02:22:32.768 --> 02:22:33.950]  We let them bring the drugs in.
[02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:34.931]  That's not enough for them.
[02:22:35.191 --> 02:22:36.913]  Now they want to put poisons in our vaccines.
[02:22:36.933 --> 02:22:37.714]  That's not enough for them.
[02:22:38.134 --> 02:22:41.018]  They just want more and more and more, and good people got to stand up.
[02:22:41.058 --> 02:22:42.319]  There's more of us than there are of them.
[02:22:42.359 --> 02:22:42.900]  Thanks, Wyatt.
[02:22:44.051 --> 02:22:48.074]  Ron in New York, Tom and others, you're up next when we get back.
[02:22:48.134 --> 02:22:50.536]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:50.556 --> 02:22:51.156]  800-259-9231.
[02:22:51.316 --> 02:23:00.803]  We'll get you up and on the air and cover a lot of the other news.
[02:23:01.564 --> 02:23:04.686]  Be sure and visit the websites, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[02:23:05.927 --> 02:23:06.828]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.328 --> 02:23:08.949]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.850 --> 02:23:12.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.493 --> 02:23:22.339]  As a listener to the Genesis Communications Network, you're aware of the many health dangers that have been unleashed upon an unsuspecting public.
[02:23:22.799 --> 02:23:27.263]  We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but how do we do but how?
[02:23:27.283 --> 02:23:29.464]  344-38 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:23:29.705 --> 02:23:29.925]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:23:29.945 --> 02:23:31.006]  Protect your family.
[02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:39.981]  Don't worry.
[02:23:40.441 --> 02:23:41.982]  This show is documented.
[02:23:42.483 --> 02:23:45.285]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:45.646 --> 02:23:49.169]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:23:49.189 --> 02:23:53.633]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:23:53.833 --> 02:23:57.776]  All right, folks, going back to your calls, let's talk to Ron in New York.
[02:23:57.856 --> 02:23:58.697]  Ron, thanks for holding.
[02:23:58.717 --> 02:23:59.418]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:23:59.438 --> 02:23:59.978]  Go ahead.
[02:23:59.998 --> 02:24:00.639]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:01.039 --> 02:24:01.599]  How are you doing?
[02:24:01.719 --> 02:24:10.224]  I just discovered something today which was reported in the magazine called First Freedom from the NRA and to their credit they did report this in the magazine and it's shocking, it really is.
[02:24:10.904 --> 02:24:24.971]  The Ashcroft Justice Department has directed the FBI that they do not have to be certain that information put into the national database that is utilized before someone could go and purchase a firearm now, that instant check database.
[02:24:25.691 --> 02:24:30.714]  They have indicated to the FBI, the Justice Department has, the information doesn't even have to be accurate.
[02:24:31.741 --> 02:24:36.423]  And if it's inaccurate, there's no incumbency upon them to remove it in any timely manner.
[02:24:37.223 --> 02:24:38.084]  Well, of course not.
[02:24:38.164 --> 02:24:42.705]  People all the time who've done nothing wrong and have no criminal record can't get guns.
[02:24:42.785 --> 02:24:45.466]  And now, under the instant check, it's all under federal control.
[02:24:45.486 --> 02:24:51.029]  They're going to reauthorize Clinton's gun ban, and they're going to expand it radically.
[02:24:52.049 --> 02:24:55.370]  So they're going to add a semi-automatic shotgun ban.
[02:24:55.410 --> 02:24:56.771]  That's the NRA telling you that.
[02:24:57.669 --> 02:25:05.079]  They're going to sign S-22, which is Patriot Act II in the Senate, full of gun registration, shutting down the gun shows, national ballistics databases.
[02:25:05.777 --> 02:25:20.530]  The most gun control, the most hardcore draconian stuff we've ever seen, and the average conservative out there has no idea, because the neocons like Rush Limbaugh, Neil Bords, Michael Savage, Sean Hannity, will not tell them.
[02:25:20.811 --> 02:25:21.851]  No, they won't tell them.
[02:25:22.292 --> 02:25:30.139]  I don't believe most people in this country who wave plastic flags and support this administration, and I'm going to tell you something, and I'll say it here over your airwaves.
[02:25:30.911 --> 02:25:37.263]  I don't care if I lose every friend I got doing it because I am acquainted with a lot of people who were under that delusion that this guy is a great patriot.
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:40.021]  This guy is not your friend.
[02:25:40.581 --> 02:25:50.005]  We've come to the point in this country where if you really love America, you're going to stop thinking in terms of Democrat and Republican and start thinking in terms of being a good American.
[02:25:50.465 --> 02:25:59.029]  Because whether it's Clinton or Bush, they might use different approaches to the problem, but neither one in the final result is out for your interest.
[02:25:59.069 --> 02:26:06.572]  When you have the Justice Department under John Ashcroft, this is not Janet Reno now, this is John Ashcroft, directing the FBI to ignore...
[02:26:07.378 --> 02:26:14.324]  The accuracy requirements of the Federal Privacy Act and telling them, just put any old information.
[02:26:14.364 --> 02:26:18.107]  This doesn't even have to be founded information that they're putting in these databases anymore.
[02:26:18.487 --> 02:26:27.514]  As a matter of fact, the information that goes into these databases are not even information where there's a finding of fact that maybe you were convicted of a crime which prohibits you from owning a firearm.
[02:26:27.974 --> 02:26:29.556]  In essence, rumors could filter through.
[02:26:30.176 --> 02:26:34.720]  Like in Stalin's Russia, a rumor could filter through and that you were finished.
[02:26:35.325 --> 02:26:39.668]  A rumor can filter through and make its way into this database, and you lose your right.
[02:26:41.489 --> 02:26:46.152]  When they snatch you, no one can say that you were even snatched by them or they get the terrorist label.
[02:26:46.433 --> 02:26:52.457]  Well, did you hear of this Deputy Attorney General in California in the Oakland Tribune saying you don't have to do anything violent to be a terrorist?
[02:26:52.517 --> 02:26:56.119]  Protesting a war helps the terrorists, so that's terrorism?
[02:26:56.159 --> 02:26:57.460]  I mean, it's the end of America.
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:26:58.821]  They're trying to push it.
[02:26:58.841 --> 02:26:59.982]  They're not going to get away with it.
[02:27:00.582 --> 02:27:02.624]  It's almost the Sovietizing of this country.
[02:27:02.724 --> 02:27:03.845]  It's not almost.
[02:27:03.905 --> 02:27:04.405]  It's worse.
[02:27:04.985 --> 02:27:08.807]  You're right, because they have more technical sophistication than Stalin had at his fingertips.
[02:27:08.827 --> 02:27:10.127]  They're not going to get away with it, though.
[02:27:10.147 --> 02:27:10.687]  We're armed.
[02:27:10.707 --> 02:27:11.568]  The Russians weren't.
[02:27:12.208 --> 02:27:14.489]  And we're armed with the Internet and information.
[02:27:14.509 --> 02:27:17.010]  We're armed with God's aid and support.
[02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:18.711]  We're going to stand against this.
[02:27:18.911 --> 02:27:24.593]  And as things get worse and worse, more good people are going to speak up and stand up inside the compartmentalization of the government.
[02:27:24.633 --> 02:27:26.354]  This whole thing runs out of ignorance.
[02:27:26.374 --> 02:27:27.674]  They count on people being ignorant.
[02:27:28.034 --> 02:27:28.575]  And that's right.
[02:27:28.635 --> 02:27:34.177]  And you're right when you say that those certain talk show hosts are going to keep people ignorant because none of them mention anything like this, yet it's going on.
[02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:40.396]  People who like to call themselves conservatives and patriotic, and there are many good average Americans who really feel that way.
[02:27:40.416 --> 02:27:42.398]  What was the night-reader news headline a few weeks ago?
[02:27:42.579 --> 02:27:44.521]  Neocons call for a new world order.
[02:27:45.774 --> 02:27:47.435]  Well, they're certainly working towards it.
[02:27:47.455 --> 02:27:48.136]  This is obvious.
[02:27:48.276 --> 02:27:51.358]  You could judge them by their deeds rather than by their statements.
[02:27:51.838 --> 02:27:56.161]  And in many cases, their deeds and their statements parallel each other, and they're not good for the American people.
[02:27:56.361 --> 02:28:04.566]  Open borders, gun grabbing, blocking Dan Burton's committee, investigating Pardongate, all the supercomputers of communist China, campaign finance reform.
[02:28:05.867 --> 02:28:20.227]  Loading the size of the Department of Education, BATF, branding the new biggest federal bureaucracy ever seen, Homeland Security, trying to federalize the cities, EAS FEMA takeover system, and camouflage as the Amber Alert, the total package of slavery.
[02:28:20.865 --> 02:28:21.946]  And you know what, Alex?
[02:28:22.186 --> 02:28:26.270]  When are, like, good average people that consider themselves Republicans conservative?
[02:28:26.310 --> 02:28:27.191]  You know what I'm talking about.
[02:28:27.211 --> 02:28:27.851]  You know the type.
[02:28:28.132 --> 02:28:33.957]  We've probably come out of that same background, you and I. When are they going to wake up and realize that this guy is a fraudulent item?
[02:28:34.257 --> 02:28:37.220]  Well, I mean, George Bush is as big a puppet or bigger than Bill Clinton.
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:38.361]  He's not running anything.
[02:28:38.641 --> 02:28:39.602]  He's a tussler head.
[02:28:39.622 --> 02:28:42.104]  When we get too focused on that, it gets into the left-right debate.
[02:28:42.404 --> 02:28:44.986]  The left's controlled, the right's controlled, and the establishment.
[02:28:45.306 --> 02:28:55.335]  We've got to telegraph that to the people and get them focused on the real issues of how the president and his treasury secretary, Snow, are bad-mouthing the dollar that's killing our stock market.
[02:28:55.655 --> 02:28:59.278]  All we had left was that fiat currency to buy the cheap slave goods.
[02:28:59.318 --> 02:29:00.058]  This is horrible.
[02:29:00.279 --> 02:29:01.800]  It is not good for manufacturing.
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:02.500]  And it's true.
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:09.105]  When are people going to get out of that left-right debate, that Democrat-Republican debate, and realize that we're at a more important crossroad now?
[02:29:09.125 --> 02:29:13.268]  There's a difference in the rhetoric with the Republicans and Democrats, but not in their actions.
[02:29:13.308 --> 02:29:14.109]  Thanks for calling.
[02:29:14.129 --> 02:29:16.450]  I appreciate it, Ron.
[02:29:17.331 --> 02:29:18.732]  Let's talk to Tom in Texas.
[02:29:18.752 --> 02:29:19.353]  You're on the air.
[02:29:19.393 --> 02:29:19.993]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:29:21.354 --> 02:29:21.534]  Yeah.
[02:29:21.874 --> 02:29:22.635]  Yes, sir.
[02:29:23.155 --> 02:29:23.676]  You're on the air.
[02:29:23.716 --> 02:29:24.136]  Go ahead.
[02:29:24.296 --> 02:29:25.117]  Yes, sir.
[02:29:25.357 --> 02:29:29.340]  Alex, I was the one that first informed Tex Mars in 1988.
[02:29:32.768 --> 02:29:42.274]  Sir, I really don't understand what you're saying.
[02:29:42.294 --> 02:29:44.496]  You're going to have to give us some background.
[02:29:44.716 --> 02:29:49.679]  Okay, the background is I went to this church that we moved pews out of.
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:53.182]  And the old man walked out cussing like a sailor because we got there late.
[02:29:53.642 --> 02:29:55.844]  He said, you realize whose church this is?
[02:29:55.904 --> 02:29:56.324]  I said, no.
[02:29:57.208 --> 02:29:59.150]  He says, this is George Bush's church.
[02:29:59.470 --> 02:30:04.093]  Well, we walked in and it had a big swastika hanging down up above the pulpit.
[02:30:05.755 --> 02:30:07.856]  And so I said, well, okay, well, tell me all about it.
[02:30:07.876 --> 02:30:09.518]  He has the Christian symbol up there, he said.
[02:30:10.358 --> 02:30:13.561]  And he showed me all the pictures in the offices of the Bush family.
[02:30:14.902 --> 02:30:21.547]  So about, I guess, two weeks later, I went and told Tex Mars about it at a convention at the Hobby Airport.
[02:30:23.108 --> 02:30:24.790]  And I was told...
[02:30:26.648 --> 02:30:40.176]  My granddaddy told me before he died in 77 that he was in World War I. Before he died, he said, it's not the communists to worry about, it's the Nazis who've infiltrated our government.
[02:30:40.896 --> 02:30:51.102]  Let me stop you, sir, because MSNBC and USA Today admit that they have swastikas and they eat off Hitler's plates at Skull and Bones at Yale.
[02:30:51.142 --> 02:30:51.322]  Right.
[02:30:52.060 --> 02:31:03.826]  And that's mainstream news in that, oh, they're just having fun, and yes, the Germans found it in 1832 at Yale, the takeover, and we know Prescott Bush was briefly arrested for trading with the enemy and paid the largest fine in U.S.
[02:31:03.846 --> 02:31:07.589]  history for running 53% of Nazi steel production through Brown Brother Harriman.
[02:31:07.949 --> 02:31:09.990]  I have those mainstream news articles in the new film.
[02:31:10.530 --> 02:31:10.670]  Okay.
[02:31:10.690 --> 02:31:10.930]  It was 1988.
[02:31:10.970 --> 02:31:13.052]  I was working for U-Haul Movers World for a little short job.
[02:31:13.072 --> 02:31:14.433]  And there was about a nine-truck convoy.
[02:31:14.453 --> 02:31:15.874]  We were to go out on this long, rung-out road.
[02:31:39.372 --> 02:31:46.316]  We drove and drove and drove and finally found a place that didn't have much of an address, but it had Arianism, kind of a rusted old sign waving back and forth.
[02:31:47.696 --> 02:31:51.158]  And an old man comes walking out wearing a blankety-blanket, all bent, you know.
[02:31:51.258 --> 02:31:53.139]  So we go, and he opens the big old door.
[02:31:54.080 --> 02:31:58.902]  And, I mean, just as big as, it's like a 20 by 30.
[02:32:00.503 --> 02:32:01.923]  Can't help but see it when you walk in the door.
[02:32:01.984 --> 02:32:06.686]  And this is a gigantic cathedral-type church on the inside, just like 100 foot high.
[02:32:07.358 --> 02:32:08.679]  And this flag hangs down.
[02:32:09.199 --> 02:32:15.522]  It's blue-filled with white swastika with a small red cross at the bottom of it, all in one big piece of material.
[02:32:16.502 --> 02:32:17.903]  And then on the left side was a U.S.
[02:32:17.923 --> 02:32:25.866]  flag, and on the right side of the building, inside the building next to where it's hanging down, is the Lone Star flag.
[02:32:27.106 --> 02:32:35.230]  And he proceeded to carry me on through the rest of the building, and he showed me all the pictures of the Bush family and everything.
[02:32:36.101 --> 02:32:40.165]  And I was shocked, and I said, well, I acted real, you know, ignorant about it.
[02:32:40.205 --> 02:32:44.269]  He just talked away, just like he was really interested in it.
[02:32:45.570 --> 02:32:47.692]  Now, where is this church, sir?
[02:32:49.613 --> 02:32:50.875]  That was the problem.
[02:32:50.895 --> 02:32:54.838]  When I told Tex Morris, he wrote about me in his book, Hidden Down Into the Rainbow.
[02:32:55.579 --> 02:32:56.780]  I'm the one that informed him about it.
[02:32:56.820 --> 02:32:57.721]  He didn't know nothing about it.
[02:32:58.869 --> 02:33:00.089]  And he found it to be true.
[02:33:00.389 --> 02:33:02.630]  Okay, where is this church, sir?
[02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:04.150]  Okay, it was on Highway 6.
[02:33:05.090 --> 02:33:05.910]  Best I can remember.
[02:33:05.930 --> 02:33:06.270]  This is an 88.
[02:33:06.570 --> 02:33:08.471]  I'll have to do some more investigation.
[02:33:08.651 --> 02:33:09.431]  Outside where?
[02:33:10.911 --> 02:33:11.451]  Right outside.
[02:33:11.491 --> 02:33:16.152]  It's close to... I say going out past Sugar Land.
[02:33:17.712 --> 02:33:18.672]  Outside Houston.
[02:33:19.253 --> 02:33:19.493]  Right.
[02:33:19.513 --> 02:33:20.613]  It's on the east side of Houston.
[02:33:21.033 --> 02:33:22.133]  I mean, west side of Houston.
[02:33:23.373 --> 02:33:23.653]  Sorry.
[02:33:24.013 --> 02:33:24.874]  West side of Houston.
[02:33:25.734 --> 02:33:26.734]  It was hard to find.
[02:33:26.814 --> 02:33:27.294]  I mean, it was...
[02:33:28.286 --> 02:33:30.907]  No, I remember reading about that.
[02:33:30.927 --> 02:33:31.508]  It's years ago.
[02:33:31.528 --> 02:33:32.488]  I'd have to dig it back out.
[02:33:50.666 --> 02:33:52.727]  But anyway... I'm trying to go back to memory.
[02:33:52.747 --> 02:33:53.628]  I know there's something about that.
[02:33:53.848 --> 02:33:55.929]  I really don't want to talk about this, sir, without evidence.
[02:33:55.969 --> 02:33:56.830]  I don't know this to be true.
[02:33:56.850 --> 02:33:57.510]  Right, I understand that.
[02:33:57.530 --> 02:33:57.991]  Yeah, it's true.
[02:33:58.011 --> 02:34:03.474]  I know that the tomb has a little church in it with a swastika, and they do that.
[02:34:03.534 --> 02:34:05.976]  But I didn't know about what you were mentioning.
[02:34:06.436 --> 02:34:07.897]  Yeah, and I wish I had more on it.
[02:34:09.718 --> 02:34:14.161]  But it really did happen to me, and I really saw this.
[02:34:15.382 --> 02:34:16.783]  But, you know, I was just...
[02:34:18.257 --> 02:34:22.679]  Also, I was going to tell you... Were there stained glass windows in this church?
[02:34:26.021 --> 02:34:27.742]  You know, it was top of a metal.
[02:34:28.122 --> 02:34:31.244]  It had a metal... The outside skin of it was metal.
[02:34:32.184 --> 02:34:32.964]  I do remember that.
[02:34:34.265 --> 02:34:38.007]  It was very tall, you know, ceiling-wise, up to the ceiling.
[02:34:38.027 --> 02:34:39.828]  But I don't remember... It was very dark, too.
[02:34:39.848 --> 02:34:44.030]  It didn't look like there was much lighting in it.
[02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:46.251]  Why were you moving pews out of it?
[02:34:46.914 --> 02:34:54.480]  All right, what they were doing was moving, they were taking the pews out and putting it into a more modern-looking building.
[02:34:54.780 --> 02:34:57.062]  How many people would you say the church would seat?
[02:34:57.942 --> 02:35:01.465]  It was probably at least 800 at the least.
[02:35:03.026 --> 02:35:04.908]  And it was real organized-looking.
[02:35:04.968 --> 02:35:09.411]  I mean, in the office area, I mean, the whole family was in there.
[02:35:10.852 --> 02:35:13.554]  They had the bushes, the kids, the whole nine yards in there.
[02:35:14.495 --> 02:35:15.716]  He says, I said, well...
[02:35:16.537 --> 02:35:17.737]  I can't believe this is Bush's.
[02:35:17.817 --> 02:35:22.258]  He said, man, this is the true church of God here.
[02:35:22.298 --> 02:35:24.419]  He said it was a branch from the Episcopalian.
[02:35:25.819 --> 02:35:26.959]  I do remember him saying that.
[02:35:27.759 --> 02:35:28.500]  A branch of it.
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:30.840]  It broke away from the Episcopalian.
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:34.001]  Sir, I appreciate your call, Tom.
[02:35:34.221 --> 02:35:34.781]  Appreciate it.
[02:35:34.821 --> 02:35:38.102]  But look, that is not how I know the global is to operate.
[02:35:38.862 --> 02:35:42.883]  It's an armored fortress at the Skull and Bones tomb, and that kind of stuff is in there.
[02:35:42.903 --> 02:35:43.543]  That's confirmed.
[02:35:44.581 --> 02:35:47.646]  It's guarded at Bohemian Grove and there is that type of stuff.
[02:35:49.168 --> 02:35:50.470]  I don't know that story, sir.
[02:35:50.570 --> 02:35:52.153]  I really don't like to speculate.
[02:35:54.764 --> 02:35:56.165]  You know, I'm not saying you're a liar.
[02:35:56.305 --> 02:35:57.926]  It just doesn't fit.
[02:35:58.566 --> 02:36:00.567]  It fits with some stuff, but not in other areas.
[02:36:00.988 --> 02:36:02.088]  Gary in Ohio.
[02:36:02.148 --> 02:36:03.069]  Gary, you're on the air.
[02:36:03.129 --> 02:36:03.549]  Go ahead.
[02:36:04.110 --> 02:36:04.570]  Hi, Alex.
[02:36:04.590 --> 02:36:05.130]  How are you doing?
[02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.851]  Pretty good, sir.
[02:36:06.291 --> 02:36:07.812]  Hey, I really enjoyed the interview.
[02:36:07.852 --> 02:36:12.214]  I'm going to have to record that tonight and do a transcript for you.
[02:36:12.294 --> 02:36:13.215]  That was a great interview.
[02:36:13.235 --> 02:36:14.095]  I went to the website.
[02:36:14.115 --> 02:36:14.956]  It was fantastic.
[02:36:17.017 --> 02:36:20.979]  One thing I wanted to mention real quick is I... Gary, are you the guy that's done some of the transcripts for us?
[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:21.580]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:23.401]  Well, I really appreciate that help, Bob.
[02:36:23.962 --> 02:36:25.903]  Were you the guy that did the Greg Powless interview?
[02:36:27.063 --> 02:36:27.683]  I think I did.
[02:36:27.864 --> 02:36:29.964]  Well, that was published in hundreds of newspapers.
[02:36:30.144 --> 02:36:30.985]  Oh, no, that wasn't me.
[02:36:31.005 --> 02:36:31.485]  That wasn't me.
[02:36:31.585 --> 02:36:32.845]  That was a lady, yeah.
[02:36:32.885 --> 02:36:35.467]  But I just want to thank everybody that transcribes interviews.
[02:36:35.487 --> 02:36:36.067]  It's really great.
[02:36:36.327 --> 02:36:38.048]  Hey, that's no problem, Alex.
[02:36:38.128 --> 02:36:39.688]  It's just part of the job.
[02:36:40.849 --> 02:36:44.390]  Also, I'm working on a poster to help get the word out.
[02:36:44.430 --> 02:36:47.291]  But what I want to mention is I finally did find a job.
[02:36:48.712 --> 02:36:50.512]  I work for a retail store.
[02:36:50.552 --> 02:36:51.993]  I would rather not mention the name.
[02:36:52.597 --> 02:36:55.419]  But they have something that kind of goes along with something you've been talking about.
[02:36:55.439 --> 02:36:57.281]  You were going with the thumb scanning and all that.
[02:36:57.601 --> 02:36:57.921]  Yes.
[02:36:58.682 --> 02:37:04.286]  We have a policy that if someone writes a check for over a certain dollar amount... They make you do an ink print.
[02:37:04.846 --> 02:37:06.027]  Yes, that white ink.
[02:37:06.688 --> 02:37:11.151]  And that's to prepare people to go into the biometrics next, which they're now doing.
[02:37:11.872 --> 02:37:12.993]  It's just a matter of time.
[02:37:13.013 --> 02:37:17.637]  I've heard you talk about pulling out the cashier regular lanes and putting in these.
[02:37:17.997 --> 02:37:20.079]  And our store has a bunch of the self-check lanes.
[02:37:20.099 --> 02:37:22.821]  They haven't gotten to the biometrics yet, but it's only a matter of time.
[02:37:22.841 --> 02:37:25.363]  First they make you self-check and put stickers on your produce.
[02:37:25.964 --> 02:37:30.888]  Then they put in the self-checkout lanes at Home Depot, HEB, wherever, your grocery store, your store.
[02:37:31.328 --> 02:37:34.430]  Then they put in thumb scanners into the self-serve lanes.
[02:37:34.771 --> 02:37:37.233]  Then they pull out the final lanes and make you do it.
[02:37:37.873 --> 02:37:38.674]  It's all progressive.
[02:37:40.125 --> 02:37:40.885]  Incrementalism.
[02:37:41.546 --> 02:37:41.926]  Thank you.
[02:37:43.026 --> 02:37:50.948]  But I just wanted to mention real quick, if I can possibly get that recorded tonight, I'll record it and pop that into the email for you, okay?
[02:37:51.528 --> 02:37:51.848]  All right.
[02:37:51.888 --> 02:37:52.608]  God bless you, sir.
[02:37:52.628 --> 02:37:53.989]  I appreciate everything you do, Gary.
[02:37:55.329 --> 02:37:57.010]  I really do appreciate everybody.
[02:37:57.350 --> 02:38:01.971]  I have tried my best to do the most honest job I can on this show.
[02:38:01.991 --> 02:38:05.872]  I've tried my best to tell the truth, to not compromise.
[02:38:06.778 --> 02:38:09.060]  I have tried to give out the most accurate information.
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:11.702]  I have researched the globalists, and I am bowled over.
[02:38:12.302 --> 02:38:18.147]  I am stunned by the complete wickedness and out-of-control, sadistic, control freak nature of these individuals.
[02:38:18.207 --> 02:38:22.490]  And my very humanity cries out to resist this and stand up against it.
[02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:24.912]  And frankly, it's for the globalists' own good as well.
[02:38:25.072 --> 02:38:26.253]  I mean, not just for the general public.
[02:38:26.733 --> 02:38:29.515]  These guys don't know how to stop, when to stop.
[02:38:29.575 --> 02:38:30.316]  They want it all.
[02:38:30.396 --> 02:38:31.136]  They want it now.
[02:38:31.276 --> 02:38:35.980]  Thugs always get total control and go over the edge and blow out their own systems.
[02:38:37.398 --> 02:38:41.741]  And that is clearly happening again here in America.
[02:38:44.083 --> 02:38:47.425]  People in these ivory towers always get power sickness.
[02:38:48.046 --> 02:38:49.947]  They get power mad, power drunk.
[02:38:49.987 --> 02:38:50.727]  They flip out.
[02:38:51.548 --> 02:38:52.529]  And it's happening again.
[02:38:52.569 --> 02:38:55.431]  They're using scientific systems and mind control on a mass scale.
[02:38:56.311 --> 02:39:04.317]  And I'd beg everyone to realize what we're facing as a society and to realize that we have these organized crime syndicates allied together bringing you this new world order.
[02:39:05.587 --> 02:39:06.707]  They want to dumb you down.
[02:39:06.747 --> 02:39:08.168]  They want to destroy creativity.
[02:39:08.188 --> 02:39:09.428]  They want to destroy the family.
[02:39:09.468 --> 02:39:13.090]  They want to sterilize us with their vaccines and cause brain damage in our children.
[02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:14.470]  They want control.
[02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:15.390]  They want it all.
[02:39:15.570 --> 02:39:16.331]  They want it now.
[02:39:16.791 --> 02:39:21.552]  Their sick argument is, well, if we don't do it, some other elite will rise and do it.
[02:39:21.612 --> 02:39:26.634]  We're the great architects, and we know best, and we molded history, and we're going to do what we want.
[02:39:28.774 --> 02:39:34.042]  We've got to have the courage to resist the New World Order, and you've got to spread the word about this show and other shows that tell the truth.
[02:39:34.063 --> 02:39:40.574]  You can always listen at Infowars.com, at Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:39:41.519 --> 02:39:43.681]  You can always join us here.
[02:39:43.721 --> 02:39:44.661]  You can always listen.
[02:39:44.681 --> 02:39:48.784]  You can always listen on Global Shortwave during the day from 11 a.m.
[02:39:48.824 --> 02:39:49.585]  until 2 p.m.
[02:39:49.945 --> 02:39:56.990]  Central on the shortwave at 12172 and 9320 and at 9, 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 6890.
[02:39:58.391 --> 02:39:59.712]  Please tell your friends and family.
[02:39:59.752 --> 02:40:00.492]  Tell them to tune in.
[02:40:00.532 --> 02:40:01.373]  Tell them to hear the truth.
[02:40:01.733 --> 02:40:11.120]  Tell them to understand that history is about thugs wanting more power and how we've been engineered psychologically to reject that historical fact
[02:40:12.222 --> 02:40:12.843]  Now is the time.
[02:40:24.275 --> 02:40:35.826]  To educate ourselves about history and about the Bill of Rights and Constitution and to look at the real record of the neocons, which is to bloat the government, butcher the Bill of Rights, militarize the police, build giant prisons.
[02:40:36.286 --> 02:40:38.709]  The number one part of our economy now is prisons.
[02:40:39.249 --> 02:40:40.430]  It's not manufacturing.
[02:40:40.470 --> 02:40:43.833]  The other biggest part of the economy is surveillance and security.
[02:40:44.774 --> 02:40:47.517]  It is a hellish world that globalists are building.
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:50.582]  And now is the time to get the word out.
[02:40:50.662 --> 02:40:52.503]  Now is the time to resist the New World Order.
[02:40:52.924 --> 02:40:54.385]  Now is the time to tell the truth.
[02:40:54.785 --> 02:40:56.727]  Now is the time to stand up for our families.
[02:40:57.147 --> 02:40:58.108]  We've got to do it.
[02:40:58.368 --> 02:41:01.290]  They're breeding us like cattle, dumbing us down like cattle.
[02:41:01.951 --> 02:41:05.314]  It is so sickening to watch these criminals get away with it day after day.
[02:41:05.654 --> 02:41:07.115]  They must be brought to justice.
[02:41:07.635 --> 02:41:12.259]  Our level of tolerance is being raised to accept higher and higher levels of insane corruption.
[02:41:12.619 --> 02:41:14.561]  A trillion dollars missing from the Pentagon.
[02:41:17.135 --> 02:41:18.837]  Seven, now nine billion dollars.
[02:41:18.897 --> 02:41:19.737]  No bids allowed.
[02:41:19.797 --> 02:41:21.039]  Contracts for Halliburton.
[02:41:21.079 --> 02:41:21.819]  It goes on and on.
[02:41:21.839 --> 02:41:23.480]  I've got a bunch of final news I'm going to hit.
[02:41:24.501 --> 02:41:27.744]  On the other side, allies have begun seizing weapons from most Iraqis.
[02:41:28.465 --> 02:41:29.946]  And much more on the other side.
[02:41:30.726 --> 02:41:34.970]  And I'll tell you how to support the broadcast by getting my documentary films and making copies and spreading the word.
[02:41:37.449 --> 02:41:44.814]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:45.094 --> 02:41:49.837]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:50.057 --> 02:41:55.701]  The Masters of Terror details how the leader using manufactured terrorism could drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.981 --> 02:41:56.682]  We're good to go.
[02:42:15.297 --> 02:42:22.061]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:42:36.187 --> 02:42:39.668]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:42:39.928 --> 02:42:43.429]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:42:43.509 --> 02:42:47.450]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:42:47.671 --> 02:42:53.852]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.253 --> 02:43:02.155]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:43:02.595 --> 02:43:07.919]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.

[02:44:43.528 --> 02:44:45.849]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:44:51.303 --> 02:44:53.103]  All right, folks, final segment.
[02:44:53.163 --> 02:44:54.344]  Some other key news here.
[02:44:55.424 --> 02:44:57.965]  Allies begin seizing weapons from most Iraqis.
[02:44:57.985 --> 02:45:05.826]  Iraqi citizens will be required to turn over automatic weapons and heavy weapons under a proclamation that allied authorities plan to issue this week.
[02:45:05.906 --> 02:45:17.969]  Allied officials said today the aim of the proclamation is to help stabilize Iraq by confiscating a huge supply of AK-47 machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, and other weapons that are used by criminal gangs, paramilitary groups, and remnants of the Saddam Hussein's government.
[02:45:18.970 --> 02:45:20.730]  Well, the remnants of Saddam Hussein's government...
[02:45:21.269 --> 02:45:22.310]  We've got the names.
[02:45:22.350 --> 02:45:24.333]  The Ba'ath Party is being put back into control.
[02:45:24.353 --> 02:45:31.141]  And they mow down crowds of Shiites and Shias that come out and protest, many times non-violently.
[02:45:31.161 --> 02:45:33.363]  It's like Tiananmen Square every week over there.
[02:45:34.565 --> 02:45:36.027]  And they're setting up a dictatorship.
[02:45:36.127 --> 02:45:38.489]  They pick 100, 200, 300 people.
[02:45:38.530 --> 02:45:40.191]  Then they vote for who they want to be the leader.
[02:45:40.232 --> 02:45:41.333]  I mean, it's totally staged.
[02:45:42.310 --> 02:45:45.115]  Now we have this Iraq conference to choose interim authority delayed.
[02:45:45.135 --> 02:45:47.619]  Remember, it says summit likely in July.
[02:45:47.639 --> 02:45:54.531]  And they'll just put in a puppet government with these 23 ministries with three Iraqis, most of them Ba'athist, running things.
[02:45:56.081 --> 02:45:59.205]  Big story about two paths of Bayer drugs in the 1980s.
[02:45:59.225 --> 02:46:00.647]  A riskier type went overseas.
[02:46:00.667 --> 02:46:14.504]  New York Times, a division of a pharmacological company, Bayer sold millions of dollars of blood clotting medicine for hemophiliacs medicine that carried a high risk of transmitting AIDS to Asia and Latin America in the mid-80s while selling new safer products in the West, according to documents obtained.
[02:46:15.004 --> 02:46:17.686]  Documents obtained by the New York Times reported this five years ago.
[02:46:17.747 --> 02:46:24.292]  The doctor who worked in the Arkansas prisons, the prosthesis doctor, saw them taking blood, people that he knew had HIV and hepatitis.
[02:46:24.673 --> 02:46:28.896]  They shipped it to Canada for a big blood company there to be shipped around the world, Western Europe as well.
[02:46:29.457 --> 02:46:35.202]  Hundreds of thousands of people, hemophiliacs, got AIDS, got HIV, got hepatitis from it.
[02:46:35.242 --> 02:46:42.308]  It just shows the mindset Bill Clinton profited greatly off of this and, of course, was never brought to justice.
[02:46:43.675 --> 02:46:44.036]  We're good to go.
[02:46:44.056 --> 02:46:44.556]  We're good to go.
[02:47:02.401 --> 02:47:06.043]  A bleak forecast reluctantly endorsed by the Bush administration's top two positions.
[02:47:06.563 --> 02:47:20.650]  Though it may seem that the SARS storm is quieting, particularly in North America, Michael T. Orsterholm, chairman of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, University of Minnesota, said it is increasingly likely disease will reemerge with a vengeance next winter, only six months away.
[02:47:22.491 --> 02:47:31.936]  I am convinced that with the advent of the early winter in the northern hemisphere in the next six months, we will see a resurgence of SARS that could far exceed our experience to date.
[02:47:33.121 --> 02:47:34.442]  Very serious information.
[02:47:34.482 --> 02:47:39.946]  Before I end this segment, I have produced nine documentary films.
[02:47:39.986 --> 02:47:42.028]  This is how I fund what I do here.
[02:47:42.048 --> 02:47:44.990]  And you are authorized to make copies of my videos.
[02:47:46.391 --> 02:47:51.335]  If you haven't ordered any of my nine films or my book, Descent into Tyranny, I don't know why you haven't.
[02:47:51.355 --> 02:47:52.155]  You really need to.
[02:47:52.175 --> 02:47:55.618]  I authorize you to make copies of it to get it out and effect change in America.
[02:47:55.918 --> 02:47:58.000]  We desperately must get this job done.
[02:47:59.341 --> 02:48:01.803]  The new film is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:01.843 --> 02:48:05.045]  Two hours and 37 minutes long.
[02:48:05.065 --> 02:48:05.045]  $25.95.
[02:48:05.225 --> 02:48:06.046]  Order three or more.
[02:48:06.546 --> 02:48:09.749]  Of any of my nine videos, they drop down to $20 a piece.
[02:48:10.089 --> 02:48:10.469]  The book is $12.
[02:48:10.730 --> 02:48:13.692]  911 Descent into Tyranny is a great book.
[02:48:14.312 --> 02:48:15.693]  911 Road to Tyranny is an amazing film.
[02:48:16.034 --> 02:48:17.254]  So is The Masters of Terror.
[02:48:17.294 --> 02:48:18.635]  And so is Police State 3.
[02:48:19.036 --> 02:48:19.916]  They're all excellent.
[02:48:19.977 --> 02:48:21.077]  I hope you'll make the call.
[02:48:21.458 --> 02:48:22.238]  Get the films.
[02:48:22.278 --> 02:48:23.019]  Get past any...
[02:48:23.539 --> 02:48:26.560]  Preparation and fear and realize that fighting this is the way to go.
[02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:31.621]  Having honor, being part of history on the side of good is the way to go to ask God for guidance.
[02:48:32.522 --> 02:48:34.122]  I pray that God will guide all of us.
[02:48:34.802 --> 02:48:36.123]  The toll-free number to order is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:48:36.143 --> 02:48:36.543]  That's 888-253-3139.
