[00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.989]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:15.515]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:17.256]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:19.118]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:20.539]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.200]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:26.764]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:29.386]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:31.127]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:39.951]  Well, well, well, another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:41.812]  And yes, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:45.454]  It is already Tuesday, the 23rd.
[00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:47.335]  The 23rd of September, 2003.
[00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:54.379]  Did you enjoy hearing Lord Bush's speech to the U.N.?
[00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.060]  What about Jacques Chirac?
[00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:00.431]  Again, it's all good cop, bad cop.
[00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:00.992]  The U.N.
[00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:02.053]  is our savior.
[00:01:02.173 --> 00:01:03.434]  It needs more power.
[00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:04.995]  It needs to run our lives.
[00:01:06.096 --> 00:01:07.457]  The U.S.
[00:01:07.497 --> 00:01:16.566]  government front man in Iraq, the Iraqi puppet, the new guy is saying, oh, yes, we need the U.N., not the U.S.
[00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:18.067]  And now the U.N.
[00:01:18.127 --> 00:01:23.432]  comes in and is going to fix Iraq and do what the evil Americans couldn't do.
[00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:25.627]  We're good to go.
[00:01:25.647 --> 00:01:25.847]  I think?
[00:01:53.482 --> 00:02:03.565]  Also, we're all egg-wielding terrorists now is the headline, and we're finding out what people are being charged with under the Patriot Act and other terrorism pieces of legislation.
[00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:07.966]  And Ashcroft and others say they need more power.
[00:02:08.186 --> 00:02:10.406]  They need it now, so we'll be getting into that.
[00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:14.207]  Also, a trial over new voting machines to begin.
[00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:21.489]  This is out of the Jacksonville Metro section of the Jacksonville newspaper, the Time Union newspaper.
[00:02:22.552 --> 00:02:25.593]  China proposes northern free trade zone.
[00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:30.834]  Palestinians could become next target of international war on terror.
[00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:37.556]  Perez says weak dollar sparks share route.
[00:02:38.517 --> 00:02:43.358]  Remember just yesterday we were reading to you about where the IMF said it's over for the dollar.
[00:02:43.738 --> 00:02:45.219]  It's going to plunge.
[00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.319]  It's going to plummet.
[00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:47.853]  We're good to go.
[00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.550]  We're good to go.
[00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.750]  I think?
[00:03:40.222 --> 00:03:46.026]  They talked about a strike in North Korea as early as next month, as early as October 10th.
[00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:50.589]  Rumsfeld said about eight months ago in a leaked document, they leaked three different battle plans.
[00:03:50.669 --> 00:04:00.676]  One of them called for nuke attacks on the capital of North Korea and on the border regions to be followed by special forces taking over the airports in the capital.
[00:04:02.463 --> 00:04:06.364]  Let me just tell you, the casualties there guaranteed to be in the tens of thousands.
[00:04:06.764 --> 00:04:08.024]  I don't care what type of weapons.
[00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:10.125]  The North Koreans are like cult members.
[00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:11.345]  It's totally brainwashed.
[00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:20.087]  Again, I'm giving the example of how they'll catch one of these surveillance boats and everybody on board will take cyanide.
[00:04:20.547 --> 00:04:22.167]  That's mind control, folks.
[00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:23.868]  That's mind control.
[00:04:23.928 --> 00:04:24.948]  Worse than the Nazis.
[00:04:25.008 --> 00:04:26.588]  Worse than the Russians.
[00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:30.269]  It's Japanese-type behavior.
[00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:39.396]  But it's not just Harry Carey, Seppuku, whatever you want to call it.
[00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:43.219]  I mean, that was the warrior class if they'd been dishonored or were going to be captured.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.823]  The North Koreans just love to commit suicide generally for no reason at all, just under orders.
[00:04:48.483 --> 00:04:50.725]  So it's more like a mindless drone mentality.
[00:04:52.206 --> 00:04:54.728]  All right, I'm discriminating against another culture.
[00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:56.930]  The Nazis were good and so were the Aztecs.
[00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.032]  No, the Nazis were bad and the Aztecs were bad.
[00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:00.955]  And so are the North Koreans.
[00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:04.617]  We'll continue to speak out against corrupt evil cultures.
[00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:05.317]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:14.281]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:18.902]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:19.043 --> 00:05:23.404]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:23.424 --> 00:05:24.805]  The New World Order.
[00:05:25.565 --> 00:05:26.466]  Can emerge.
[00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:30.811]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:37.799]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:39.962]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:40.322 --> 00:05:50.728]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:50.928 --> 00:05:56.352]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:56.812 --> 00:05:59.453]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:59.473 --> 00:06:00.034]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.074 --> 00:06:00.574]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:01.875]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:10.800]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.101]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:06:12.301 --> 00:06:15.704]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:06:15.824 --> 00:06:16.264]  Phenol?
[00:06:16.564 --> 00:06:23.669]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.093]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:06:28.213 --> 00:06:28.653]  Fragrance?
[00:06:29.033 --> 00:06:33.777]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:06:33.917 --> 00:06:38.520]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.362]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:06:41.622 --> 00:06:45.044]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:48.727]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:06:48.947 --> 00:06:51.268]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:52.349]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:12.903]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:07:13.163 --> 00:07:16.665]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:07:16.765 --> 00:07:20.708]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:07:20.928 --> 00:07:27.092]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:27.493 --> 00:07:35.418]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:07:35.818 --> 00:07:41.162]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:07:41.322 --> 00:07:45.084]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:47.326]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:49.547]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:07:49.787 --> 00:07:54.110]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:07:54.170 --> 00:08:00.314]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:08:03.696 --> 00:08:07.538]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.401]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:15.883]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.345 --> 00:08:31.592]  I'm sure that a lot of you have heard about the airline JetBlue taking your personal information and giving it to not just Homeland Security but the military, but
[00:08:32.515 --> 00:08:45.002]  We'll give you the specific details of that in the middle of the next hour with Declan McCullough, who writes for Znet News and a bunch of other really high-brow tech publications.
[00:08:45.643 --> 00:08:47.804]  He attracts Big Brother activities.
[00:08:47.864 --> 00:08:53.307]  So Declan McCullough will be joining us here on the show in about an hour and 20 minutes.
[00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:59.991]  Speaking of high-tech fraud, here's a headline out of the Times-Union newspaper.
[00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:02.631]  Paper in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:09:02.732 --> 00:09:05.192]  Trial over new voting machines to begin.
[00:09:07.293 --> 00:09:11.734]  But it isn't over the fact that the voting machines have back doors hooked into the government.
[00:09:11.754 --> 00:09:15.715]  It isn't the fact that they have wireless internet connections that no one told anybody about.
[00:09:15.735 --> 00:09:24.717]  It isn't the fact that industry officials have been recorded in meetings talking about how to oppress the people and how to divert our attention from the reality that there is no more election.
[00:09:26.058 --> 00:09:27.078]  No, it's about the
[00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:32.187]  Americans with Disabilities Act, that's what it's about.
[00:09:32.207 --> 00:09:35.496]  Saying that they can't use these machines.
[00:09:35.677 --> 00:09:36.679]  So see, they always...
[00:09:38.268 --> 00:09:47.030]  Stuff gets brought to court on side secondary issues, and obviously if you're blind or you're deaf or you've got a problem like that, it's not a secondary issue.
[00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:55.191]  But my point is, is that isn't it the number one issue that the CIA is involved with all the big touchscreen companies?
[00:09:55.691 --> 00:10:04.453]  And if you've missed our analysis of that or the articles about it or the transcripts or the interviews or the news articles, the mainstream news articles,
[00:10:04.973 --> 00:10:09.894]  We have an election fraud section on prisonplanet.com.
[00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:13.375]  But I see this in so many cases.
[00:10:14.935 --> 00:10:19.356]  The judges will allow a lawsuit over Americans with Disabilities Act.
[00:10:19.496 --> 00:10:21.777]  Oh, is it easy for them to use?
[00:10:23.197 --> 00:10:30.019]  But there won't be any lawsuits that are allowed through, though they've been filed, over the fact that they've caught Diebold and other companies
[00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:31.331]  We're good to go.
[00:10:53.331 --> 00:11:00.833]  Duval County elections officials discriminated against blind and other disabled voters when they purchased new ballot equipment in 2001.
[00:11:02.474 --> 00:11:03.974]  Why is a judge doing this?
[00:11:04.855 --> 00:11:13.457]  In the past, judges didn't rule on cases of discrimination or cases of bank robbery or grand larceny or cases of rape.
[00:11:15.098 --> 00:11:16.158]  Juries did.
[00:11:16.438 --> 00:11:18.559]  Grand juries called for indictments.
[00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:21.640]  The local magistrates
[00:11:22.661 --> 00:11:32.843]  Executed the indictments, the police, the sheriff came and arrested you and took you and clapped you in irons, and then a jury of your peers examined you and examined the case.
[00:11:33.423 --> 00:11:34.803]  Not a judge, but over and over.
[00:11:34.823 --> 00:11:38.724]  Administrative law courts, admiralty courts, on and on and on.
[00:11:38.784 --> 00:11:49.586]  I read these rulings where they're just snatching people's land and taking guns and banning gun shops and just a whole plethora of issues, and it's judges, just judges.
[00:11:52.569 --> 00:11:54.850]  Trial over new voting machines to begin.
[00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:02.014]  Testimony begins today in an Americans with Disabilities Act lawsuit filed by three Jacksonville voters and a national disabled rights organization.
[00:12:03.315 --> 00:12:04.396]  Now, notice there's no jury.
[00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:07.798]  Now, when did this happen for the first time?
[00:12:07.838 --> 00:12:09.819]  You think, well, that must be the way it's always been.
[00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:10.099]  No.
[00:12:10.859 --> 00:12:12.180]  When did this first happen?
[00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:13.661]  It happened in 2000.
[00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:16.723]  It started in 1999 and went through 2000.
[00:12:18.027 --> 00:12:27.032]  Right here in Central Texas, in Waco, Texas, federal judge Walter Smith, who sat on the criminal case, sat on the civil case.
[00:12:27.072 --> 00:12:30.534]  Now, he should have been recused, but that never happened.
[00:12:32.656 --> 00:12:35.237]  And he said on the news, he said, there will be no juries.
[00:12:36.638 --> 00:12:39.180]  We don't have juries in these type of suits anymore.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.521]  Oh, yeah, they just passed a federal law.
[00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:45.585]  Like passing a federal law that black people are two-thirds human.
[00:12:46.005 --> 00:12:47.466]  I say it's not a legitimate law.
[00:12:47.706 --> 00:12:49.368]  You can say it's the law all day.
[00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:52.511]  Stalin can say it's the law that he took farmers' land.
[00:12:52.851 --> 00:12:55.133]  Those farmers have a right to fight back against Stalin.
[00:12:56.374 --> 00:12:57.335]  You need to understand this.
[00:12:58.976 --> 00:13:04.001]  And I went down and I protested Walter Smith, and I made a big deal out of it that he was not, quote, impaneling a jury.
[00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:06.202]  So then I got death threats.
[00:13:06.243 --> 00:13:07.784]  I'm not saying they were from Walter Smith.
[00:13:09.062 --> 00:13:09.743]  We're good to go.
[00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.231]  Because that was a big case.
[00:13:41.271 --> 00:13:42.471]  That was embarrassing Bill Clinton.
[00:13:42.831 --> 00:13:46.333]  And so I pointed out, I said, why isn't there a jury?
[00:13:48.874 --> 00:13:50.475]  And I just kept asking that question.
[00:13:50.495 --> 00:13:55.218]  And what was really hurting him was a big station right here in Austin that I was on at the time.
[00:13:55.898 --> 00:13:57.739]  And a lot of people started asking that question.
[00:13:57.779 --> 00:13:59.340]  The paper started asking that question.
[00:14:01.411 --> 00:14:04.853]  And then Smith said, okay, I will impanel a secret jury.
[00:14:04.913 --> 00:14:06.353]  They are only advisory.
[00:14:06.633 --> 00:14:08.114]  I will take their verdict in secret.
[00:14:08.654 --> 00:14:12.776]  And if I don't like their verdict, he actually said this, I will not even make it public.
[00:14:12.796 --> 00:14:15.217]  Well, of course, the jury that he, quote, appointed.
[00:14:15.497 --> 00:14:18.078]  He appointed a seven-member special jury.
[00:14:18.498 --> 00:14:21.300]  He chose people, folks, who you understand.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.121]  And, of course, they came back and said, no, we're throwing this lawsuit out.
[00:14:25.141 --> 00:14:26.842]  And he said, oh, the jury said so.
[00:14:27.082 --> 00:14:28.943]  But they weren't even going to have that until...
[00:14:29.643 --> 00:14:41.429]  I don't want to go down a rabbit trail with this, but just reading this article about the electronic voting machine lawsuit down in Duval County, Florida, there's no jury involved?
[00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.231]  And this is happening everywhere.
[00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:46.431]  Everything is staged now.
[00:14:47.072 --> 00:14:49.773]  They're having all these Ashcroft town hall meetings.
[00:14:50.073 --> 00:14:51.274]  The public isn't allowed in.
[00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:54.015]  When the former White House president
[00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:57.056]  Have you figured that out yet, folks?
[00:15:24.747 --> 00:15:26.808]  Just the illusion of freedom and liberty.
[00:15:28.308 --> 00:15:29.809]  Now, we're going to take a lot of calls today.
[00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:34.590]  If you want to comment on this or any other issue, any other news item, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:34.890]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.331]  Weak dollars sparks...
[00:15:47.483 --> 00:15:55.290]  ShareRoute, a drop in the value of the dollar caused stock markets to plunge around the world on Monday.
[00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.551]  That was yesterday.
[00:15:58.552 --> 00:16:12.744]  And as that was happening, we were reading a London Guardian article that just had quotes and hyperlinks for the IMF statement, International Monetary Fund, that's the bankruptcy holding company, one of the larger ones, for the private Rothschild family.
[00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:21.859]  That openly owns a large majority portion of it, along with the Queen of England, Dutch Roll family, Saxe-Coburg-Gothers, and others.
[00:16:23.995 --> 00:16:28.436]  And they come right out at a key point and say the dollar is going to plunge.
[00:16:28.476 --> 00:16:29.617]  It's going to be dead meat.
[00:16:29.757 --> 00:16:31.777]  It could totally unravel.
[00:16:32.178 --> 00:16:36.219]  The American leviathan, when it falls over, is going to fall even harder.
[00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:39.860]  Little economies would have already gone bankrupt and be in depression.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.081]  But when America falls, it's finally going to unravel.
[00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:44.301]  I ought to dig that back out.
[00:16:44.681 --> 00:16:46.842]  The quotes were so unbelievable.
[00:16:47.788 --> 00:16:48.609]  By the IMF.
[00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:51.330]  See, the IMF is like the executive.
[00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:59.455]  And then you've got its spokes, its regional governors, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England and the Bundesbank of Deutschland.
[00:17:01.597 --> 00:17:02.777]  You've got the Bank of France.
[00:17:02.817 --> 00:17:03.918]  You've got the Bank of Moscow.
[00:17:03.938 --> 00:17:05.139]  You've got all these banks.
[00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:06.540]  And it's simple.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.201]  Your country gets invaded, taken over.
[00:17:08.881 --> 00:17:10.142]  They set up a dictatorship.
[00:17:10.686 --> 00:17:14.768]  Put in their banks and then put puppets in and withdraw and call your country a democracy.
[00:17:14.808 --> 00:17:23.772]  But as Lord Rothschild said, I care not who runs the government or who passes the laws, only who controls the money and then everything else flows from there.
[00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:24.993]  Paraphrase.
[00:17:27.374 --> 00:17:28.515]  And so they come out.
[00:17:28.535 --> 00:17:34.558]  I mean, that's the equivalent of... I'm trying to think of a good analogy.
[00:17:35.038 --> 00:17:35.258]  I mean...
[00:17:36.266 --> 00:17:45.449]  That's like an axe murderer hacking somebody up and putting them in the back of their truck and then driving it to the police and saying, look, I want to report that this person was hacked up by an axe.
[00:17:45.469 --> 00:17:50.931]  You know, there's blood splattered all over the axe murderer, and of course the cops are going to look at them.
[00:17:50.951 --> 00:17:56.773]  But for the IMF, I mean, this is who runs our policy, orders Greenspan around, orders the U.N.
[00:17:56.813 --> 00:17:57.213]  around.
[00:17:57.313 --> 00:17:59.094]  This is it, the private IMF, folks.
[00:18:00.374 --> 00:18:02.455]  They own giant cash machines, huge computers.
[00:18:02.475 --> 00:18:05.176]  They can add as many ones or zeros as they want behind it.
[00:18:05.822 --> 00:18:07.704]  They write the credit for the world out of nothing.
[00:18:08.725 --> 00:18:10.386]  And they finance the universities.
[00:18:10.426 --> 00:18:11.147]  They own the media.
[00:18:11.187 --> 00:18:12.328]  They own the defense agencies.
[00:18:12.408 --> 00:18:12.788]  Everything!
[00:18:13.949 --> 00:18:15.290]  They founded the CIA.
[00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:17.272]  They wrote the National Security Act.
[00:18:17.372 --> 00:18:18.673]  They are BCCI.
[00:18:19.454 --> 00:18:20.675]  They are Clark Clifford.
[00:18:21.115 --> 00:18:21.976]  All of his crew.
[00:18:24.298 --> 00:18:27.361]  And they just come right out and just say, Hey, your dollar's dead meat!
[00:18:27.421 --> 00:18:28.402]  Ha ha ha!
[00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:32.986]  George Soros, his little Rockefeller Rothschild minion, hopping up and down going, Yes, yes, yes!
[00:18:33.692 --> 00:18:35.793]  And you just watch the dollar plunge.
[00:18:37.553 --> 00:18:38.574]  And that's all we had left.
[00:18:38.654 --> 00:18:40.554]  I mean, I don't like this fiat currency.
[00:18:40.594 --> 00:18:47.057]  I wish we had our real money issued by our government, not by private banks, you know, with Federal Reserve at the top of it, instead of the United States note.
[00:18:50.538 --> 00:18:54.579]  I can't stand that the little bit of money I got in the bank is being devalued massively.
[00:18:54.599 --> 00:18:55.560]  It makes me angry.
[00:18:57.901 --> 00:18:59.001]  And it's all by design, but
[00:19:00.416 --> 00:19:03.178]  Folks, even if it's a fiat currency, it's all we had left.
[00:19:03.238 --> 00:19:04.339]  We don't have the factories.
[00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:05.660]  We don't have the job base.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.503]  We had that World Reserve backup currency that everybody traded in, and so it had value.
[00:19:10.543 --> 00:19:11.684]  You understand?
[00:19:11.704 --> 00:19:17.549]  That's why you can go to Mexico, or that's why you can go to other terrible countries and buy more with your money.
[00:19:17.569 --> 00:19:21.231]  You know, eat a big meal for five people for, you know, ten bucks, eight bucks.
[00:19:22.852 --> 00:19:24.113]  Whereas it costs $200 here in the States.
[00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:36.258]  You won't be able to do that anymore, but that means domestically with all these goods and the $10 CD players or the $200 20-inch color TVs, whatever.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.761]  And it was all engineered.
[00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:44.985]  I mean, they haven't been putting the police in riot gear and building prisons and mass relocation centers for nothing.
[00:19:46.366 --> 00:19:47.647]  They've been engineering this.
[00:19:48.227 --> 00:19:52.971]  And so I want the FBI folks listening and BATF and police, when they take what you've got
[00:19:54.415 --> 00:19:56.538]  Just be smart enough to remember who did it to you.
[00:19:56.599 --> 00:19:56.959]  Okay?
[00:19:57.179 --> 00:19:58.782]  Just for me, would you do that?
[00:19:58.802 --> 00:20:00.885]  And maybe you'll decide to join the American people.
[00:20:02.007 --> 00:20:04.030]  And stop being part of this criminal crime syndicate.
[00:20:04.591 --> 00:20:06.153]  As a compartmentalized, useful idiot.
[00:20:06.814 --> 00:20:08.216]  We'll be right back with more news.
[00:20:08.236 --> 00:20:08.617]  Stay with me.
[00:20:11.638 --> 00:20:17.580]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[00:20:47.702 --> 00:20:48.502]  We're good to go.
[00:21:09.421 --> 00:21:18.026]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:21:18.247 --> 00:21:29.534]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:21:29.754 --> 00:21:32.415]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:32.736 --> 00:21:36.698]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is over-filtered.
[00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:39.182]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:21:39.362 --> 00:21:41.224]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:47.453]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:21:47.714 --> 00:21:53.362]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:21:58.368 --> 00:21:59.069]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:09.375 --> 00:22:09.815]  Gold.
[00:22:10.156 --> 00:22:11.437]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:22:11.717 --> 00:22:17.803]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:17.983 --> 00:22:21.827]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:22.167 --> 00:22:24.049]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:24.089 --> 00:22:26.391]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:34.198]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:22:34.618 --> 00:22:35.038]  We're good to go.
[00:22:52.627 --> 00:22:55.029]  For the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.

[00:24:02.212 --> 00:24:02.252]  800-430-6692.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.761]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, jumping back into the news.
[00:24:20.861 --> 00:24:23.323]  And look, I'm not trying to sit here and be negative.
[00:24:23.363 --> 00:24:23.863]  Understand that.
[00:24:40.803 --> 00:24:43.444]  I want you to know who's going to take your pension funds.
[00:24:43.604 --> 00:24:45.724]  I want you to know who's taking the veterans' health care.
[00:24:46.244 --> 00:24:48.305]  I want you to know who's raping this country.
[00:24:48.805 --> 00:25:01.547]  When they tell you that, oh, we're in all this debt and we overextended ourselves and we all live these haughty lifestyles and it's all our fault, that's a fraud, folks.
[00:25:01.587 --> 00:25:09.169]  They set up a system where it's impossible for any country to dig out of the debt system they've set up.
[00:25:11.667 --> 00:25:24.677]  Now, certainly, are there people that get a bunch of credit cards and run up huge debts and don't pay them off and have horrible fiscal responsibility and who are addicted to the home shopping network?
[00:25:25.057 --> 00:25:26.058]  Absolutely.
[00:25:26.318 --> 00:25:31.942]  I'm not saying, you know, with the decadence of the New World Order comes a general malaise and decadence.
[00:25:34.004 --> 00:25:35.645]  I remember being in college.
[00:25:35.665 --> 00:25:40.028]  I remember when I hit about 17 in high school, I started getting credit cards in the mail.
[00:25:40.703 --> 00:25:41.724]  And I got a credit card.
[00:25:42.725 --> 00:25:44.146]  And I would pay it down every month.
[00:25:45.267 --> 00:25:47.389]  And I did that for years and years.
[00:25:47.689 --> 00:25:50.531]  And I would get credit card after credit card after credit card.
[00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:54.074]  Sometimes I was getting credit cards every week in the mail.
[00:25:55.335 --> 00:25:56.276]  You've been pre-approved.
[00:25:56.296 --> 00:25:57.036]  You've been pre-approved.
[00:25:57.076 --> 00:25:58.558]  I could have had 50 of these things.
[00:25:58.998 --> 00:26:01.840]  I could have run up, you know, $100,000 debt.
[00:26:02.521 --> 00:26:03.221]  But I didn't.
[00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:08.666]  My dad sat me down and explained how it was a scam and how they operated, how they wanted to get me into their system.
[00:26:09.981 --> 00:26:11.581]  But a strange thing happened.
[00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:16.763]  A few years after always paying the credit card down, I got a letter.
[00:26:17.163 --> 00:26:18.443]  My credit card had been canceled.
[00:26:19.763 --> 00:26:20.163]  That's right.
[00:26:20.183 --> 00:26:26.325]  You actually get a bad credit score if you don't have debt and if you pay off your credit card.
[00:26:26.605 --> 00:26:28.545]  Because I was just using it as a debit card.
[00:26:30.566 --> 00:26:37.228]  I would occasionally, when I was out doing business, I would pay for the gas and write it off on taxes or whatever.
[00:26:37.608 --> 00:26:38.688]  That's what I was taught to do.
[00:26:39.796 --> 00:26:42.018]  And I only use the credit card for stuff like that.
[00:26:42.038 --> 00:26:43.519]  I've always been kind of a cash guy.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.222]  And you're saying, what does this have to do with a plunging dollar?
[00:26:48.323 --> 00:26:51.726]  The globalists took over the world's central banks.
[00:26:52.347 --> 00:26:53.988]  They print the money out of nothing.
[00:26:55.029 --> 00:27:00.974]  The countries you see being attacked, the seven rogue nations of the countries, good or bad, bad leaders are good.
[00:27:01.454 --> 00:27:02.235]  That doesn't matter.
[00:27:02.595 --> 00:27:06.078]  The point is they were sovereign outside the New World Order.
[00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:08.020]  They weren't under globalist control.
[00:27:09.508 --> 00:27:27.377]  And there's this big revelation today that Wesley Clark admitted in a book that in 2001 when he was still in the military that he saw a plan to invade seven of the Middle Eastern countries starting with Iraq and how did he know this?
[00:27:27.537 --> 00:27:30.198]  And this is an incredible revelation!
[00:27:31.303 --> 00:27:34.144]  Folks, PNAC was saying it in 2000, 99, 98.
[00:27:35.165 --> 00:27:36.966]  We need giant terror attacks.
[00:27:37.426 --> 00:27:38.747]  Pearl Harbor was very good.
[00:27:38.767 --> 00:27:40.067]  We need another one bigger.
[00:27:40.628 --> 00:27:42.889]  Terrorism will empower the New World Order.
[00:27:42.969 --> 00:27:45.470]  We will mobilize for imperial domination.
[00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.871]  We'll grab all the oil.
[00:27:46.911 --> 00:27:53.394]  Saddam's not a threat, but terrorism is the pretext to get that oil and then attack all the neighbors and totally dominate everyone.
[00:27:53.434 --> 00:27:54.694]  Globalism, globalism.
[00:27:54.895 --> 00:27:56.175]  We want social welfare.
[00:27:56.315 --> 00:27:58.036]  We want to control people through big government.
[00:27:58.196 --> 00:27:59.637]  We believe in abortion.
[00:27:59.657 --> 00:27:59.697]  Ha!
[00:28:00.317 --> 00:28:02.238]  I mean, you ought to read these things.
[00:28:02.418 --> 00:28:10.260]  We believe in race-specific bio-weapons to kill certain races, Dick Cheney wrote in the Rebuilding America's Defenses, September 2000.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.041]  I mean, it's so crazy.
[00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:20.863]  It's like turning on TV, it's a late-night horror movie, and there's the mad scientist going, I'll release the bio-weapon and kill certain races!
[00:28:21.843 --> 00:28:23.684]  You're like, man, that movie's far out.
[00:28:23.724 --> 00:28:24.545]  That would never happen.
[00:28:24.965 --> 00:28:32.890]  You open a PNAC document written by Dick Cheney, we believe that race-specific bioweapons will be very useful and will be legitimate against certain races.
[00:28:36.552 --> 00:28:37.833]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:38.073 --> 00:28:40.494]  PNAC has that on their website, folks.
[00:28:41.815 --> 00:28:48.939]  Michael Meacher, the big British lord, he's not a lord, but the head of the energy and slash environment group, said, look, I was all part of this.
[00:28:48.999 --> 00:28:49.840]  I'm not being part of this.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.521]  He came out, released the documents.
[00:28:52.847 --> 00:28:53.048]  I think?
[00:28:53.068 --> 00:28:53.228]  I think?
[00:29:19.326 --> 00:29:22.208]  I mean, if you like Napkin Gap, you're going to get a lot more of it, okay?
[00:29:22.228 --> 00:29:28.931]  Remember on the news saying how great it would be back in 94 and people were lying conspiracy theorists that said it would be bad?
[00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:30.972]  This is all by design.
[00:29:31.012 --> 00:29:32.153]  They want control of you.
[00:29:32.173 --> 00:29:35.895]  They don't want you to be self-sufficient.
[00:29:35.935 --> 00:29:37.035]  They want you to be dependent.
[00:29:38.836 --> 00:29:46.180]  But what about the race-specific bioweapon comments in a document written by Cheney and Rumsfeld, this particular one footnoted by these two?
[00:29:47.262 --> 00:29:50.605]  Or they say that it will be legitimate in the future to use race-specific weapons.
[00:29:51.586 --> 00:29:53.027]  Why is it that top story?
[00:29:53.827 --> 00:29:55.409]  Do you know what race-specific weapons are?
[00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:56.730]  Your call's coming up.
[00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:57.250]  Stay with us.
[00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.051]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.352 --> 00:30:01.273]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.754 --> 00:30:03.355]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.276 --> 00:30:06.958]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.177 --> 00:30:15.460]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:30:15.661 --> 00:30:17.742]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:30:18.002 --> 00:30:20.944]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded.
[00:30:21.564 --> 00:30:22.525]  Viagra and many more.
[00:30:22.745 --> 00:30:23.946]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[00:30:23.966 --> 00:30:25.007]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[00:30:49.924 --> 00:30:52.206]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[00:30:52.286 --> 00:30:53.287]  Alex Jones here.
[00:30:53.307 --> 00:31:02.013]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time as well.
[00:31:02.033 --> 00:31:09.919]  And I'm sorry, I don't talk about ghosts and goblins, chupacabras, yetis, bigfoots, flying saucers.
[00:31:10.299 --> 00:31:11.820]  I don't talk about Mars bases.
[00:31:12.661 --> 00:31:16.444]  I don't talk about Galileo going into the service of Jupiter.
[00:31:17.393 --> 00:31:21.275]  I don't talk about stuff that really doesn't affect us or can't be proven.
[00:31:22.996 --> 00:31:46.170]  I talk about the IMF and World Bank with plans to put you in forced labor camps, tens of millions of Americans, it's been federally announced, to have troops with machine guns over you working in the factories, to take your children from you and make them be raised in government dormitories, to forcibly inject you with hundreds of vaccines, also engineering them into the food supply system,
[00:31:47.037 --> 00:31:53.638]  Mass cloning of embryos, total abortion globally, forced on women.
[00:31:54.699 --> 00:31:56.139]  We talk about stuff like that.
[00:31:56.619 --> 00:31:58.139]  Real things that are happening.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:31:59.860]  Real atrocities.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.861]  I'm not going to talk about speculation.
[00:32:03.901 --> 00:32:06.941]  I'm not going to talk about diversions or distractions.
[00:32:07.021 --> 00:32:08.782]  We focus in on real issues.
[00:32:09.102 --> 00:32:09.242]  And...
[00:32:11.645 --> 00:32:13.106]  I'm putting the call out to listeners.
[00:32:13.826 --> 00:32:21.310]  I let you guys call in, you gals call in, about any subject you want, any news item, any propaganda piece on television.
[00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:27.334]  That makes for very interesting listening, very informative listening, because you never know which direction this show is going to go.
[00:32:28.514 --> 00:32:32.636]  We talk about the nature of man, the nature of the world, the nature of history.
[00:32:33.197 --> 00:32:40.861]  We try to get folks to get outside the box to shift their paradigms, to expand their understanding of the human condition.
[00:32:41.809 --> 00:32:42.310]  We're good to go.
[00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.871]  We're good to go.
[00:32:57.202 --> 00:32:58.303]  We're trying to stop that.
[00:32:58.363 --> 00:33:07.893]  We know that it's always been a small, vocal, focused, informed minority that has changed history for the good or for the bad.
[00:33:08.333 --> 00:33:12.597]  And so we're calling good folks, informed folks, to get involved in the fight.
[00:33:12.697 --> 00:33:19.144]  But sometimes I throw out a subject and I say, listeners, I really want to get your comment on it.
[00:33:20.894 --> 00:33:27.678]  Maybe it's Chinese mobile death van driving around, grabbing political dissidents and shoving them in them and then killing them.
[00:33:28.779 --> 00:33:31.680]  Or, you know, the Stars and Stripes article.
[00:33:32.741 --> 00:33:40.765]  That's, again, mainstream pro-military, pro-government paper admitting that, yeah, the troops have to pay for their own food when they're shot in Iraq at the hospital.
[00:33:41.186 --> 00:33:42.346]  Some of their medical care as well.
[00:33:42.366 --> 00:33:43.227]  They have to pay for it.
[00:33:45.208 --> 00:33:47.129]  We need to comment on stuff like this.
[00:33:47.369 --> 00:33:48.950]  The American Bar Association.
[00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:52.351]  Saying, well, no more attorney-client privilege.
[00:33:52.371 --> 00:33:56.252]  We're going to tattle on you to the judge and the prosecutor without letting you know.
[00:33:56.272 --> 00:33:58.453]  We want to get rid of juries.
[00:33:58.633 --> 00:34:08.176]  I mean, still, I talk to the average person, the average patriot, the average conservative, libertarian, whatever, Christian, freedom lover, and they don't know about the American Bar Association.
[00:34:08.236 --> 00:34:10.016]  I'm getting emails every day, every day.
[00:34:10.036 --> 00:34:12.477]  I was reading emails last night.
[00:34:14.366 --> 00:34:20.771]  They were saying stuff like, I want to see the article where the American Bar Association says there's no attorney-client privilege.
[00:34:21.131 --> 00:34:22.072]  I don't believe it.
[00:34:22.152 --> 00:34:24.914]  I've been listening to you for years, and I don't believe it.
[00:34:24.934 --> 00:34:30.498]  See, obviously, I've got to do a better job of reporting this, but I've read the article four or five times.
[00:34:30.518 --> 00:34:31.398]  It was all over the news.
[00:34:31.859 --> 00:34:33.640]  But again, who can keep track of all this?
[00:34:34.921 --> 00:34:40.965]  They've got a new bill where illegal aliens can have dual citizenship to destroy our sovereignty.
[00:34:41.185 --> 00:34:42.046]  That's confirmed.
[00:34:42.106 --> 00:34:43.067]  I mean, how do you...
[00:34:44.306 --> 00:34:46.107]  Properly spend time on these issues.
[00:34:47.468 --> 00:34:48.388]  Here's another one.
[00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:53.691]  Again, I go back to this PNAC document, one of hundreds, written by Cheney and Rumsfeld.
[00:34:53.731 --> 00:35:02.136]  They're the guys signed on to this particular plan or strategy in this big globalist think tank.
[00:35:02.776 --> 00:35:10.841]  And in 2000, Cheney and Rumsfeld say, well, we need race-specific bioweapons, and this is going to be legitimate to use these on certain races.
[00:35:11.934 --> 00:35:18.978]  Now, they say the use of certain race-specific genome attack pathogens, and they have a little meeting about it.
[00:35:19.038 --> 00:35:20.299]  Yeah, this will be very legitimate.
[00:35:20.839 --> 00:35:21.159]  What?
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.342]  Folks, that's, again, I use the term off the charts, breaks the scale, crushes the mold.
[00:35:27.663 --> 00:35:31.846]  Just, there's no way to describe, to scream or yell or...
[00:35:33.593 --> 00:35:37.994]  Hyperventilate or calmly describe how horrible that is.
[00:35:38.054 --> 00:35:43.375]  I mean, that's Joseph Mingala Nazi stuff, but being openly discussed.
[00:35:44.895 --> 00:35:46.636]  And who's involved in developing all this?
[00:35:46.816 --> 00:35:47.296]  IBM.
[00:35:48.956 --> 00:35:50.096]  IBM goes around.
[00:35:50.116 --> 00:35:51.337]  Let me tell you what IBM does.
[00:35:52.877 --> 00:35:53.197]  Okay?
[00:35:54.057 --> 00:35:56.418]  International business machines.
[00:35:57.358 --> 00:35:57.698]  Yes.
[00:35:57.718 --> 00:35:57.818]  Yes.
[00:35:58.795 --> 00:36:00.056]  What does IBM go around doing?
[00:36:00.076 --> 00:36:07.081]  They go around buying up the biotech companies, buying up the implantable microchip companies, buying up key areas in the control grid.
[00:36:08.642 --> 00:36:14.026]  They pretty much control about half of the human genome project, the other half's the government.
[00:36:15.667 --> 00:36:26.254]  And I told you two, three years ago, well in 2000, that's three years ago almost now, I went and read for like two hours one night the corporate minutes at ADES.com, Applied Digital Solutions, and basically it said that
[00:36:27.034 --> 00:36:30.979]  IBM owned all their debt, controlled them, told their board of directors what to do.
[00:36:30.999 --> 00:36:33.262]  That's why we're such a good company to invest in.
[00:36:33.282 --> 00:36:35.124]  We're basically an IBM shill.
[00:36:36.165 --> 00:36:43.133]  And then they made the leap that the communist Chinese army would invest in it, and now that's where the big plant is.
[00:36:43.233 --> 00:36:46.557]  It's made the tens of thousands of chips, over 5,000 now implanted.
[00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:51.362]  I'm being deployed, putting prisoners in Mexico, prisoners in Russia.
[00:36:51.822 --> 00:36:54.103]  There's a deal with the California Bureau of Prisons.
[00:36:54.604 --> 00:36:55.444]  That's Reuters.
[00:36:55.644 --> 00:36:57.045]  I mean, this is scary, folks.
[00:36:57.626 --> 00:37:09.154]  Imagine a movie where there's this mega corporation, and it's involved with a communist Chinese military, and it's got a big plant making implantable chips.
[00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:15.313]  And then in the movie, you turn the news on, you know, it shows the scene of a family watching TV and all the talking heads on every channel.
[00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:21.937]  You put the channel on there saying, every child needs a chip, a chip so good, chip keep you safe, a chip, chip, chip.
[00:37:22.577 --> 00:37:24.518]  I mean, somebody wake me up from this nightmare.
[00:37:24.558 --> 00:37:27.340]  But we're not in a nightmare, folks.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.000]  We're awake.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:28.801]  This is happening.
[00:37:30.702 --> 00:37:32.283]  And then we extrapolate out from there.
[00:37:32.303 --> 00:37:38.046]  You know, IBM's involved in fostering and supporting and driving all these bioweapons developments.
[00:37:41.445 --> 00:37:43.288]  And the whole human genome.
[00:37:43.548 --> 00:37:45.671]  And it's just pure wickedness, folks.
[00:37:46.652 --> 00:37:54.182]  And people say, well, they'd never, you know, the government, the Level 4 Bioweapons Labs, the Human Genome Project, boy, they'd never do anything bad.
[00:37:54.323 --> 00:37:55.184]  That'd be crazy.
[00:37:56.132 --> 00:38:15.156]  And you read all the policy reports of the Ted Turners, the Prince Phillips, the Jacques Cousteaus, the Nature Conservancies, the Sierra Clubs, the 1973 CIA orders to the IMF and World Bank about telling the Third World to sterilize half their women or they wouldn't get any funding, IMF and World Bank funding.
[00:38:15.176 --> 00:38:16.496]  I mean, that's all admitted.
[00:38:18.116 --> 00:38:23.057]  And Australia's plan through food to put in a bioweapon to sterilize Asia.
[00:38:23.737 --> 00:38:24.978]  Well, that's all on Road to Tyranny.
[00:38:25.298 --> 00:38:27.058]  I mean, folks, I have hundreds of these articles.
[00:38:27.859 --> 00:38:39.663]  And then in a PNAC document, in a PNAC document, he got Dick Cheney and the Defense Secretary, Rummy, talking about how this is going to be legitimate.
[00:38:40.303 --> 00:38:41.524]  And they've done everything.
[00:38:41.844 --> 00:38:44.025]  Everything they say they'll do, they do it.
[00:38:44.525 --> 00:38:46.506]  You better be really concerned, folks.
[00:38:51.583 --> 00:38:51.983]  Wow.
[00:38:52.183 --> 00:39:09.908]  I mean, you know, I would expect that if I started writing papers on the Internet about how using race-specific bioweapons was reasonable and good, and let's say I owned a big biotech firm that had the scientists and the capability to develop this stuff, I would expect I would be arrested.
[00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:12.469]  I should be arrested instantly.
[00:39:13.969 --> 00:39:17.430]  Taken in and interrogated.
[00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:18.331]  I don't mean tortured.
[00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:19.831]  Interrogated to get answers.
[00:39:20.453 --> 00:39:21.453]  That's what should happen.
[00:39:21.493 --> 00:39:23.174]  But no, it's the Vice President.
[00:39:24.314 --> 00:39:26.695]  It's the Vice President with all this at their fingertips.
[00:39:27.055 --> 00:39:28.236]  These psychopaths.
[00:39:29.096 --> 00:39:34.478]  These gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, ultra-liberals, if you want to use your term, folks.
[00:39:34.518 --> 00:39:37.259]  I mean, that's what they are according to your fake neocon paradigm.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.920]  And I look at that.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.641]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:39:44.804 --> 00:40:05.288]  If you or I had the capability to do this type of stuff, and we were publicly saying it was legitimate and might need to happen, then you add to this over 22 dead microbiologists from Australia to Russia to the U.S., all of them in key race-specific bioweapons development programs.
[00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:07.909]  All of them.
[00:40:09.978 --> 00:40:15.761]  Either they're in the development or they were in the treatment and knowing how to identify where something came from.
[00:40:17.301 --> 00:40:18.682]  And folks, these people are dying.
[00:40:19.202 --> 00:40:20.143]  They get pulled over.
[00:40:21.503 --> 00:40:23.624]  Why would somebody stop on the side of the road without flat tires?
[00:40:23.664 --> 00:40:25.325]  Well, cop, you know, someone in a police car.
[00:40:25.625 --> 00:40:27.286]  They pull them over, their brains are bashed out.
[00:40:27.686 --> 00:40:29.967]  Their brains are bashed in, they're thrown off bridges.
[00:40:31.388 --> 00:40:36.370]  One top bioweapons guy had his guts cut out and a big pentagram carved in his back.
[00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:37.511]  That's the Washington Post.
[00:40:38.075 --> 00:40:39.356]  People dying in airlock.
[00:40:39.396 --> 00:40:41.458]  People getting smashed by cars on the streets.
[00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:44.941]  I mean, small plane wrecks, crashes.
[00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:46.342]  It goes on and on.
[00:40:46.722 --> 00:40:48.164]  Shot in the back at their home.
[00:40:48.484 --> 00:40:50.486]  Husband and wife and kids lined up and shot.
[00:40:50.966 --> 00:40:52.107]  I mean, come on, FBI.
[00:40:52.147 --> 00:40:53.028]  Come on, government.
[00:40:53.528 --> 00:40:55.550]  Are you going to stand by while this happens?
[00:40:58.773 --> 00:41:00.234]  This is really scary.
[00:41:01.455 --> 00:41:03.497]  We live in times of tri-men souls.
[00:41:06.201 --> 00:41:08.302]  This is what I want to talk about.
[00:41:08.842 --> 00:41:09.983]  Does this concern you?
[00:41:11.403 --> 00:41:12.304]  Who's up first, Mark?
[00:41:12.324 --> 00:41:13.144]  Who should I go to first?
[00:41:14.945 --> 00:41:16.125]  Rod in Texas, go ahead.
[00:41:17.486 --> 00:41:28.091]  Yeah, Alex, I disagree with you about the importance of topics such as UFOs.
[00:41:28.431 --> 00:41:34.834]  You called in the last five minutes yesterday when I was talking about the whole UFO movement run by the Rothschilds, Kansas City Star.
[00:41:35.794 --> 00:41:39.156]  It's run by the Rothschilds, run by Clinton's former chief of staff as their main guy.
[00:41:39.176 --> 00:41:46.561]  This is mainstream news, and it's there to discredit serious issues, like what Dick Cheney said, and they mix it together to discredit it.
[00:41:46.961 --> 00:41:47.542]  Now, you go ahead.
[00:41:47.562 --> 00:41:48.242]  You've got the floor.
[00:41:48.402 --> 00:41:49.043]  Okay, okay.
[00:41:49.063 --> 00:41:51.985]  What I'm saying is that it's a mistake to marginalize it.
[00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:53.626]  And here's a good example.
[00:41:54.066 --> 00:41:57.188]  Most of your listeners would recognize me.
[00:41:57.649 --> 00:42:01.071]  They know who I am, and I've done some very good research over the last 10 years.
[00:42:02.145 --> 00:42:06.589]  And I called you and warned you about Gordon Novell, and you went ballistic on me.
[00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:09.712]  Gordon Novell, you had on a number of times.
[00:42:09.732 --> 00:42:11.754]  He's tied in with John Alexander.
[00:42:11.794 --> 00:42:13.095]  Sir, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[00:42:13.796 --> 00:42:14.977]  Hey, let me talk to him.
[00:42:15.117 --> 00:42:16.058]  No, no, put him on hold.
[00:42:17.679 --> 00:42:21.863]  Now, the problem here is we're going to take what you say one point at a time.
[00:42:21.963 --> 00:42:23.685]  I don't want to get all mad here, okay?
[00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:27.112]  I just fly in saucers, discussions of them.
[00:42:27.452 --> 00:42:29.093]  You want to know my hot button, folks?
[00:42:29.374 --> 00:42:32.556]  Chupacabras, yetis, green men, I just go ballistic.
[00:42:33.697 --> 00:42:35.659]  It's like I'm a bull and it's a red cape.
[00:42:36.039 --> 00:42:37.160]  Just don't try it with me.
[00:42:38.101 --> 00:42:43.725]  Now, Gordon Novell did a lot of great work, helped get the flare tape out, really helped burn the government.
[00:42:44.675 --> 00:42:49.616]  Okay, I believe I sent you a picture of him sitting in between John Alexander and Victoria Lakers, his wife.
[00:43:10.615 --> 00:43:14.358]  John Alexander is the head of the First Earth Battalion.
[00:43:15.138 --> 00:43:24.285]  He is funded by Robert Bigelow in Las Vegas at a place called the National Institute of Discovery Science.
[00:43:25.086 --> 00:43:29.188]  They are very well connected to past and present administrations.
[00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:30.109]  Well, no, that's true.
[00:43:30.209 --> 00:43:35.433]  Novell continually tells me that he's been to Area 51 and the Flying Saucers and all that.
[00:43:35.533 --> 00:43:35.733]  Right.
[00:43:35.793 --> 00:43:37.675]  Well, that's the point that I'm trying to make.
[00:43:37.855 --> 00:43:38.215]  Okay.
[00:43:38.275 --> 00:43:38.915]  Now I understand.
[00:43:39.136 --> 00:43:39.456]  Sorry.
[00:43:41.129 --> 00:43:49.255]  It is weird to have a guy who brought the flare footage out and got it from the CIA director right before the CIA director was killed, and then he's running around telling me he's seen the flying saucers.
[00:43:50.396 --> 00:43:51.777]  We didn't bring that up here on air, though.
[00:43:52.097 --> 00:43:54.979]  That's all Gordon basically talks about when you're with him privately.
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.541]  That's the point that I wanted to make.
[00:43:57.621 --> 00:44:04.266]  This does have a sociological impact and an impact on people's belief systems.
[00:44:04.366 --> 00:44:05.026]  It's giant.
[00:44:05.086 --> 00:44:05.787]  It's huge.
[00:44:05.847 --> 00:44:06.547]  It's huge.
[00:44:07.048 --> 00:44:09.129]  That's all anybody's talking about is little green mints.
[00:44:11.764 --> 00:44:12.765]  Okay, that's all I have to say.
[00:44:12.825 --> 00:44:14.186]  Okay, well, I don't want to run over you anymore.
[00:44:14.467 --> 00:44:15.768]  Go ahead and finish up what you're saying.
[00:44:15.828 --> 00:44:17.369]  No, that's all I have to say.
[00:44:17.449 --> 00:44:19.291]  I just don't think it should be marginalized.
[00:44:20.572 --> 00:44:23.055]  Well, let me stop you here for a second, okay?
[00:44:23.876 --> 00:44:25.377]  This is why I'm mad, okay?
[00:44:25.938 --> 00:44:27.139]  Are you ready to hear why I'm angry?
[00:44:27.339 --> 00:44:27.679]  Go ahead.
[00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:36.908]  Because we fight to be on the AM and FM affiliates we're on, from Rhode Island to Texas to New Mexico to California.
[00:44:37.654 --> 00:44:44.957]  And we get great ratings and great listenership, and we're successful, and then the stations get bought out and they put mindless drivel on it.
[00:44:45.057 --> 00:44:50.660]  But it's very frustrating to me to be talking to a Ph.D.
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:57.323]  or to be talking to a police officer or SWAT team commander, and I'm telling them about Operation Northwoods, an official U.S.
[00:44:57.343 --> 00:45:01.565]  government plan to carry out terror attacks that's admitted by ABC News, Baltimore Sun, and the U.S.
[00:45:01.585 --> 00:45:01.905]  government.
[00:45:04.088 --> 00:45:04.748]  We're good to go.
[00:45:04.768 --> 00:45:04.908]  I think?
[00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:52.123]  And all I hear when I tune into these shows that do discuss some of the real stuff that's going on is mixed in goat people, yetis, bigfoots, green men, and I'm telling you what most of those people are putting out is it's an industry, it's a new age type scam.
[00:45:53.973 --> 00:45:55.054]  It's out of control.
[00:45:55.234 --> 00:45:57.216]  I know the government's got advanced technologies.
[00:45:57.316 --> 00:45:58.577]  I know they've got space planes.
[00:45:58.637 --> 00:46:02.781]  I know they've got flying disks because I've got time-life books where it says U.S.
[00:46:02.841 --> 00:46:03.421]  Air Force on it.
[00:46:03.441 --> 00:46:04.522]  They admit they've got stuff.
[00:46:04.902 --> 00:46:06.724]  The Germans had crap that looked like that.
[00:46:07.124 --> 00:46:07.885]  That's admitted.
[00:46:08.745 --> 00:46:10.947]  So I know all that.
[00:46:11.067 --> 00:46:15.191]  My point is that almost everything I've looked into with UFOs is government.
[00:46:15.891 --> 00:46:20.375]  You know, the giant flying V. Well, NASA's got pictures of it.
[00:46:20.395 --> 00:46:21.496]  That's their big space plane.
[00:46:22.282 --> 00:46:24.724]  So we're stuck in 1970s technology.
[00:46:26.085 --> 00:46:28.948]  It's parceled, doled out to us real slow.
[00:46:29.428 --> 00:46:34.572]  I know there's suppressed technology, but I'm telling you, regardless, that's coming out of the government.
[00:46:34.873 --> 00:46:37.095]  You can say, well, they got it from aliens.
[00:46:37.115 --> 00:46:38.636]  Some people say, well, they got it from the devil.
[00:46:39.477 --> 00:46:40.598]  Whatever, folks.
[00:46:41.779 --> 00:46:43.420]  The Bible says we're made in the image of God.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.501]  I believe it came from man.
[00:46:45.371 --> 00:46:50.392]  We're smart, and we build on things, and there's a lot of suppressed technology.
[00:46:50.793 --> 00:47:03.356]  My whole point is every time I talk about something real or something that's concrete, the SWAT team guy I'm talking to or the PhD will say, oh, but that's like that crowd that believes in the UFOs or the crowd that believes in whatever.
[00:47:03.376 --> 00:47:13.039]  And that's because the X-Files and all these shows on purpose will mix FEMA's got camps in with they're run by aliens from the South Pole.
[00:47:13.099 --> 00:47:13.719]  Now do you understand?
[00:47:14.474 --> 00:47:15.855]  Yeah, I see your point.
[00:47:17.756 --> 00:47:23.299]  And so I try to shelter my show from that so people can tune in to all the other stuff they want to hear.
[00:47:23.859 --> 00:47:29.022]  I'm trying to get folks to understand that, hey, the Federal Reserve's private.
[00:47:29.802 --> 00:47:33.184]  I'm dealing with stuff that I know is hurting us, that I know is evil.
[00:47:36.766 --> 00:47:40.828]  Well, again, going back to, you know, you're talking about children disappearing.
[00:47:40.908 --> 00:47:41.088]  Well,
[00:47:41.852 --> 00:48:01.678]  I can tell you for a fact where a lot of these children wind up and what's done to them and why it's done to them, basically it's to children that are traumatized at an early age develop psychic abilities and they are being employed in these remote viewing programs.
[00:48:01.738 --> 00:48:07.680]  I have a friend who was in force recon in the 1980s and he was still getting intelligence from remote viewers.
[00:48:08.345 --> 00:48:10.846]  So they still are employing this technology?
[00:48:10.866 --> 00:48:12.606]  Oh, well, the government believes in the occult.
[00:48:12.866 --> 00:48:14.027]  I mean, they conduct rituals.
[00:48:14.087 --> 00:48:14.567]  I've been there.
[00:48:14.627 --> 00:48:15.167]  That's a fact.
[00:48:15.187 --> 00:48:19.368]  The Bohemian Grove has admitted that I went in there by the San Francisco Chronicle and the Press Democrat.
[00:48:19.908 --> 00:48:21.329]  And national television admits.
[00:48:21.609 --> 00:48:23.750]  Trio Network interviewed the Grove leaders.
[00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.450]  They admit.
[00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:26.070]  Yeah, we carry out these rituals.
[00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:27.471]  So, yeah, I know they believe in the occult.
[00:48:28.031 --> 00:48:28.671]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:31.443 --> 00:48:37.825]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:48:37.985 --> 00:48:44.326]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:48:44.626 --> 00:48:53.368]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:48:53.608 --> 00:49:00.830]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:06.071]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:49:06.271 --> 00:49:11.792]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:49:12.132 --> 00:49:15.293]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:49:15.633 --> 00:49:23.775]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:50:27.567 --> 00:50:29.589]  PO Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[00:50:29.849 --> 00:50:39.457]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:50:39.737 --> 00:50:44.481]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:50:44.701 --> 00:50:50.346]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:50:50.566 --> 00:50:55.088]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:50:55.308 --> 00:51:02.471]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:02.491 --> 00:51:07.034]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:07.194 --> 00:51:09.715]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:09.935 --> 00:51:16.658]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:16.878 --> 00:51:22.143]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:22.163 --> 00:51:22.623]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:22.703 --> 00:51:27.167]  But the last caller was a great example of what I've been talking about.
[00:51:44.269 --> 00:51:45.809]  I mean, the government believes in the occult.
[00:51:45.909 --> 00:51:52.091]  Yes, the government spent hundreds of millions of dollars on psychics, what they call remote viewers, try to give it a new label.
[00:51:53.131 --> 00:51:55.772]  And they claim that it worked for them, but they've now suspended it.
[00:51:56.092 --> 00:51:57.232]  I don't believe that for a minute.
[00:51:58.472 --> 00:52:00.513]  It's like saying they suspended MKUltra.
[00:52:00.553 --> 00:52:04.934]  I mean, the mind control now is just mainstream, being used against us at every level.
[00:52:06.832 --> 00:52:08.653]  But again, I don't get into stuff like that.
[00:52:08.793 --> 00:52:16.118]  I get into, Dick Cheney says in a document he wrote that race-specific bioweapons used against certain races isn't going to be legitimate.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:18.540]  Oh, really?
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.922]  Race-specific bioweapons that kill certain races?
[00:52:21.962 --> 00:52:25.705]  That's a lot bigger than remote viewing, folks.
[00:52:25.825 --> 00:52:26.345]  And you know what?
[00:52:26.385 --> 00:52:27.246]  It's documented.
[00:52:28.667 --> 00:52:31.629]  Folks, I've got a giant stack of news here that's all admitted right up front.
[00:52:31.809 --> 00:52:34.311]  This tyranny of every imaginable configuration.
[00:52:34.989 --> 00:52:43.779]  They're arresting people under 16-year-old deportation cases, retroactively saying, well, the group you were a member of 16 years ago wasn't listed as a terrorist.
[00:52:43.819 --> 00:52:46.822]  You haven't been a member in decades, but we're going to go ahead and arrest you now.
[00:52:48.704 --> 00:52:49.925]  Oh, you threw an egg at somebody.
[00:52:49.965 --> 00:52:50.946]  That's an act of terrorism.
[00:52:50.966 --> 00:52:52.428]  We're going to charge you under the Patriot Act.
[00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:53.469]  That's provable!
[00:52:57.742 --> 00:53:05.103]  So that's all I'm trying to say here, and I know we're about to go to Mike and Manuel and a bunch of other people that are patiently holding the toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:53:05.183 --> 00:53:10.124]  And I've been trying to be nice to the callers.
[00:53:11.265 --> 00:53:13.765]  I was meeting the last caller, and he did make really good points.
[00:53:14.725 --> 00:53:15.425]  Thank you, sir.
[00:53:16.285 --> 00:53:17.326]  Call back some other time.
[00:53:17.346 --> 00:53:19.126]  We'll spend more time talking about it.
[00:53:20.526 --> 00:53:24.547]  There I was giving a speech about how I didn't want to talk about UFOs and
[00:53:25.353 --> 00:53:29.555]  Now, it's a big distraction, and man, first caller out of the box talking about it.
[00:53:30.375 --> 00:53:32.676]  I had steam coming out of my ears here.
[00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:38.139]  Do you understand they're building giant bioweapons labs?
[00:53:38.159 --> 00:53:39.719]  They've already built a bunch of them.
[00:53:39.939 --> 00:53:43.381]  They're killing the microbiologists that could blow the whistle on it or who developed it.
[00:53:44.056 --> 00:53:51.381]  When they start getting rid of those that made it, folks, when they start getting rid of people that can treat it, folks, you've got a serious problem when the U.N.
[00:53:51.401 --> 00:53:57.945]  and the globalists and the big fat cats, when they put out their policy reports, it's all about how they want to get rid of 85% and 95% of us.
[00:53:58.145 --> 00:53:59.086]  That's scary.
[00:53:59.826 --> 00:54:00.707]  And that's real.
[00:54:00.907 --> 00:54:02.548]  And it sounds totally nuts.
[00:54:02.848 --> 00:54:07.671]  But I can say it because they said it and because I can document it up one side and down the other.
[00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:13.415]  And that's why this show has credibility despite all of my hyperventilation and, you know, theatrics.
[00:54:15.513 --> 00:54:17.175]  All right, I do this at the end of every hour.
[00:54:19.337 --> 00:54:21.419]  I really want the listeners to support this show.
[00:54:21.779 --> 00:54:30.587]  The show is exploding in size, but that means I need more staff and more computers and more video editors, and we need your support.
[00:54:30.968 --> 00:54:34.871]  I've got a couple films in the works, and we need your support to get the other films so we can make these new films.
[00:54:35.472 --> 00:54:38.595]  And plus, the films are so good, and they're waking people up.
[00:54:39.138 --> 00:54:55.063]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, Police State's Retotal Enslavement, my book, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny, that covers government-sponsored terror, and the tales of the police state, and the end of Posse Comitatus, and September 11th, and Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:54:55.103 --> 00:54:56.644]  I mean, it's an incredible book.
[00:54:57.324 --> 00:55:03.586]  Most books you go out and get, even by so-called patriots or Christians or conservatives, you get little tidbits of info.
[00:55:03.606 --> 00:55:06.307]  This Order Out of Chaos is just ridiculous.
[00:55:07.114 --> 00:55:09.356]  Every page is an information overload.
[00:55:09.597 --> 00:55:13.340]  You want to be an expert on the New World Order and some of their top tactics?
[00:55:14.081 --> 00:55:16.624]  And how the UFO movement is controlled by the Rothschilds?
[00:55:17.785 --> 00:55:19.206]  And how it's a big fraud?
[00:55:19.226 --> 00:55:20.047]  That's in the book.
[00:55:20.708 --> 00:55:21.709]  Order Out of Chaos.
[00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:24.552]  You need to have my book.
[00:55:24.652 --> 00:55:25.493]  But Order Out of Chaos is $19.95.
[00:55:25.613 --> 00:55:26.594]  Get a second copy as a gift for only $11.95.
[00:55:26.694 --> 00:55:27.274]  That's two books for $31.95.
[00:55:30.379 --> 00:55:34.002]  Give it as a Christmas gift or as a gift to a neighbor or a birthday present.
[00:55:34.442 --> 00:55:35.723]  Just give the gift of knowledge.
[00:55:35.743 --> 00:55:36.784]  Get Order Out of Chaos.
[00:55:36.804 --> 00:55:38.446]  Get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:55:38.666 --> 00:55:41.768]  My longest film on VHS, 2 hours 40 minutes.
[00:55:41.848 --> 00:55:42.749]  It's great, too.
[00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:45.431]  Very scary stuff.
[00:55:45.732 --> 00:55:46.812]  And they're waking people up.
[00:55:46.952 --> 00:55:50.115]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:50.275 --> 00:55:51.456]  Order right now.
[00:55:51.556 --> 00:55:52.357]  Do not wait.
[00:55:52.417 --> 00:55:53.218]  Do not hesitate.
[00:55:53.238 --> 00:55:53.998]  Do not dawdle.
[00:55:54.679 --> 00:55:55.880]  Do not pass go.
[00:55:56.764 --> 00:55:58.445]  Just get the videos, get the books.
[00:55:58.525 --> 00:55:59.726]  Call toll-free right now.
[00:55:59.846 --> 00:56:00.526]  Operators are there.
[00:56:00.546 --> 00:56:01.426]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:01.446 --> 00:56:02.047]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:56:02.147 --> 00:56:03.427]  Or InfoWars.com.
[00:56:03.728 --> 00:56:08.390]  The second hour, your calls, a ton of news and guests straight ahead.
[00:56:21.875 --> 00:56:27.217]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:56:27.357 --> 00:56:39.641]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.219 --> 00:56:47.860]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:49.581]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.301 --> 00:56:51.402]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.042 --> 00:56:52.863]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.624 --> 00:56:55.545]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.565 --> 00:56:58.807]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.388 --> 00:57:03.490]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:04.531 --> 00:57:07.033]  Music
[00:57:17.325 --> 00:57:18.486]  All right, my friends.
[00:57:18.506 --> 00:57:20.207]  We're already into the third hour.
[00:57:20.347 --> 00:57:25.191]  I know a lot of callers were holding and dropped off, and I was bad about not getting to you because we had Declan McCullough on.
[00:57:25.211 --> 00:57:28.734]  Talk about, well, the Army involved with the airlines.
[00:57:29.194 --> 00:57:30.415]  JetBlue, to be specific.
[00:57:30.475 --> 00:57:31.356]  Others are doing it, too.
[00:57:32.116 --> 00:57:38.161]  The grocery stores are doing it, taking all your personal data, your eating habits, your reading habits, and giving it over to the government.
[00:57:38.541 --> 00:57:43.785]  So stop using credit cards, folks, at these big chain stores.
[00:57:44.485 --> 00:57:46.587]  Mom and pops aren't uploading your stuff to the government.
[00:57:48.593 --> 00:57:49.033]  All right.
[00:57:49.274 --> 00:57:51.855]  We're about to go to your calls, and I've got just a bunch of other news.
[00:57:51.935 --> 00:57:53.897]  Believe me, I'm just going to get to the news, have her take some calls.
[00:57:54.197 --> 00:57:55.098]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:57:55.118 --> 00:57:58.360]  There's a lot of new developments on 100 fronts, and I'm going to cover it all.
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:01.642]  Right now, let's go to Marcello in beautiful Canada.
[00:58:01.662 --> 00:58:02.042]  Welcome.
[00:58:02.483 --> 00:58:03.543]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:58:04.724 --> 00:58:11.469]  I was calling to tell you and your listeners about a voting option that I feel no one knows about.
[00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:16.332]  In the last Canadian election, which happened to be in 2000 as well,
[00:58:18.017 --> 00:58:19.418]  I voted non-confidence.
[00:58:20.519 --> 00:58:33.726]  And you have to go to the polling station and you hand over your registration notice and you tell them that I'd like to register my vote of non-confidence in all the candidates.
[00:58:34.126 --> 00:58:36.047]  So that's saying none of the above.
[00:58:36.368 --> 00:58:38.569]  Yeah, and it doesn't count as a spoiled ballot.
[00:58:39.389 --> 00:58:41.430]  It counts as a vote for no one.
[00:58:42.631 --> 00:58:43.432]  Hey, I like that.
[00:58:43.852 --> 00:58:44.032]  Yeah.
[00:58:45.582 --> 00:58:51.145]  What you do, too, is you go to a precinct, and you have a bunch of those, and then you watch if it's touchscreen.
[00:58:51.165 --> 00:58:52.846]  That'll never even show up in the election results.
[00:58:52.866 --> 00:58:53.827]  You'll have some proof there.
[00:58:54.387 --> 00:59:01.312]  Yeah, and when I did this, they had to hand-enter it themselves on a separate sheet.
[00:59:03.113 --> 00:59:05.375]  I don't know if we have that here in the United States.
[00:59:06.155 --> 00:59:10.698]  Well, the average Canadian doesn't even know about it, because I tell people about it.
[00:59:11.038 --> 00:59:13.500]  They say, oh, that sounds interesting, but I don't think you can do it.
[00:59:14.093 --> 00:59:15.374]  And I tell them, I did it.
[00:59:16.294 --> 00:59:17.095]  So, you know.
[00:59:17.715 --> 00:59:20.236]  Well, you know, that's another way the globalists run election fraud.
[00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:21.537]  That's how the Soviet Union would do it.
[00:59:21.677 --> 00:59:25.899]  They'd say, you can elect one of these three guys from the Duma, and they're all KGB.
[00:59:25.979 --> 00:59:28.921]  I mean, it's a scam.
[00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:29.241]  Yeah.
[00:59:30.381 --> 00:59:39.226]  And my understanding is if the majority vote non-confident, they have to refield the whole candidate again.
[00:59:41.407 --> 00:59:43.008]  Now, we have a writing system here.
[00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:49.154]  If it's non-confidence in one writing, they have to refuel candidates in that writing.
[00:59:50.074 --> 00:59:53.417]  But I don't know if it's on the whole national scale.
[00:59:54.017 --> 00:59:56.639]  No, I can't imagine it happening.
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.421]  So few people even know about it.
[01:00:01.802 --> 01:00:05.465]  Well, I don't know if our system is like that here in the United States.
[01:00:05.525 --> 01:00:09.908]  Maybe we can ask some of the listeners that know more about the election process than I do, but I'm
[01:00:10.894 --> 01:00:12.495]  I know this is a lot of stuff I don't know.
[01:00:12.535 --> 01:00:13.376]  I learn more every day.
[01:00:13.396 --> 01:00:15.298]  I learn how much I don't know every day.
[01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:18.640]  So I'll definitely try to research that, and that's interesting.
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:19.761]  Anything else, Marcello?
[01:00:21.342 --> 01:00:27.347]  Oh, I happened to catch a minute of the, what's that called again?
[01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:31.230]  The Matrix, the ABC show.
[01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:37.295]  Oh, Threat Matrix, training you how to be a slave, be surveilled, and how torture is a great American value.
[01:00:37.315 --> 01:00:38.756]  That's basically the message of the show.
[01:00:39.491 --> 01:00:43.474]  Yeah, I only indulged it for a minute, and I felt repulsed.
[01:00:44.334 --> 01:00:54.322]  According to the USA Today review, and all I've seen was the ad in the movie theater for it, and they were torturing some guy, and it was good that they were doing it, according to the Sicko Show, the Nazi program.
[01:00:54.362 --> 01:01:00.366]  But watching Threat Matrix really does turn my stomach.
[01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:06.030]  But reading the USA Today review, they say it's just endlessly how you're being listened to, how you're being watched, how good it is.
[01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:07.591]  What did you get from watching it?
[01:01:08.311 --> 01:01:19.437]  Well, in that one minute, I really got how it's trying to acclimate people by sanitizing a completely bunch of nefarious activities.
[01:01:19.457 --> 01:01:22.579]  So basically they were surveilling everybody.
[01:01:23.039 --> 01:01:25.200]  Everyone was being watched, but this is how we stay safe.
[01:01:25.921 --> 01:01:30.323]  Well, the scene I saw, there was the torture scene and getting info out of the guy.
[01:01:30.383 --> 01:01:33.085]  I'll tell you, sir, I've got to stop you.
[01:01:33.445 --> 01:01:35.006]  You know, I said I was going to tape this, folks.
[01:01:35.146 --> 01:01:35.406]  I didn't.
[01:01:36.101 --> 01:01:37.343]  Please type it and mail it to me.
[01:01:37.623 --> 01:01:37.924]  Stay there.
[01:01:37.964 --> 01:01:40.067]  I want to hear, Marcello, about the torture scene.
[01:01:43.392 --> 01:01:46.276]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.280]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:54.222]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:01:54.502 --> 01:01:59.763]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:02:00.043 --> 01:02:04.204]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:02:04.384 --> 01:02:08.145]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:02:08.405 --> 01:02:12.986]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:02:13.126 --> 01:02:19.391]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:02:19.431 --> 01:02:21.313]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:02:21.753 --> 01:02:23.835]  Order 911 The Road to Tyranny today.
[01:02:23.915 --> 01:02:28.198]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:02:29.799 --> 01:02:35.444]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[01:02:35.564 --> 01:02:37.586]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[01:02:37.806 --> 01:02:39.327]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:02:39.487 --> 01:02:41.569]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:02:42.705 --> 01:02:48.590]  Some people believe a group of wealthy men control political parties, the American media, and the wealth of our nation.
[01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:49.711]  Is this true?
[01:02:50.272 --> 01:02:55.216]  Dr. Stanley Monteith spent 40 years studying secret societies and subversive movements.
[01:02:55.557 --> 01:03:01.342]  He lived in Africa for three years, and when he returned home, he studied the writings of the men who shaped the modern world.
[01:03:01.762 --> 01:03:03.504]  His book, Brotherhood of Darkness,
[01:03:03.724 --> 01:03:07.427]  Identify the people who control the world and the organizations they created.
[01:03:07.687 --> 01:03:15.272]  Dr. Monteith exposes the movement behind Rhodes Scholarship, the origin of the Council on Foreign Relations, and the myths surrounding communism.
[01:03:15.612 --> 01:03:18.234]  He discusses the goal of all covert organizations.
[01:03:18.474 --> 01:03:23.297]  So if you read Brotherhood of Darkness, you will learn a secret that has been passed down through the centuries.
[01:03:23.477 --> 01:03:29.421]  When you learn the secret, you will understand what the future holds and what you must do to help preserve our nation.
[01:03:29.881 --> 01:03:30.542]  We're good to go.
[01:03:42.259 --> 01:03:43.920]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:49.983]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:03:50.223 --> 01:03:55.366]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:03:55.706 --> 01:04:04.991]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:04:05.331 --> 01:04:10.273]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:14.614]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:04:14.814 --> 01:04:19.576]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:25.838]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:04:26.198 --> 01:04:27.519]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:27.579 --> 01:04:28.759]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:56.673 --> 01:04:59.897]  Alright, last Thursday I talked a lot about it.
[01:04:59.937 --> 01:05:01.259]  I saw the promo for it.
[01:05:04.282 --> 01:05:07.226]  And I told people that they ought to tune into it just to monitor it.
[01:05:07.626 --> 01:05:08.447]  I didn't watch it.
[01:05:08.627 --> 01:05:13.253]  I was doing a TV show Thursday night and then taking care of business, fighting the New World Order.
[01:05:13.854 --> 01:05:16.657]  I didn't watch Threat Matrix, but I read the horrible review of it.
[01:05:17.256 --> 01:05:17.636]  We're good to go.
[01:05:17.676 --> 01:05:18.197]  We're good to go.
[01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:42.171]  But Marcello lives up in Canada.
[01:05:42.191 --> 01:05:47.893]  He says he was flipping through the channels and saw the torture scene, and can you describe that to us, please?
[01:05:49.094 --> 01:06:06.041]  Well, yeah, like you said, there was a guy wrapped down to this chair, and he looked, you know, very disheveled, and you can see lesions on his body, and he had the torture babe asking him questions, and it's all about, you know...
[01:06:06.892 --> 01:06:10.553]  Barreting out whether or not he's telling all he knows or the truth.
[01:06:10.813 --> 01:06:13.913]  And they've got to do it because there's about to be a major attack.
[01:06:14.813 --> 01:06:16.154]  They've got to do it.
[01:06:16.234 --> 01:06:17.374]  I mean, they don't like it.
[01:06:17.394 --> 01:06:23.155]  I mean, when I saw her, it was this face of she's sad, but she's still shaking with power and she's all sexy.
[01:06:23.555 --> 01:06:24.475]  I'm touching you.
[01:06:24.495 --> 01:06:26.555]  And everybody's going, ooh, she's so powerful.
[01:06:26.795 --> 01:06:27.776]  Is that what you got from it?
[01:06:28.436 --> 01:06:36.057]  Yeah, and then she dials in with her pals and they've got all kinds of high-tech equipment with them and they're all looking real...
[01:06:36.778 --> 01:06:43.128]  I like their... It's got everything going and everything's so smooth and perfect.
[01:06:44.189 --> 01:06:44.309]  And...
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.961]  Like I said, I... These are our new authority figures.
[01:06:48.381 --> 01:06:56.365]  So the guy they're torturing, I mean, I just saw her torturing the daylights out of him in the ad, and it said, their power unlimited to keep you safe.
[01:06:56.705 --> 01:06:58.105]  Their method's unorthodox.
[01:06:58.125 --> 01:06:59.126]  And the guy's getting tortured.
[01:06:59.186 --> 01:07:01.027]  He's going, that's my question!
[01:07:01.587 --> 01:07:02.867]  I'm a good American!
[01:07:03.007 --> 01:07:04.048]  I torture people!
[01:07:04.068 --> 01:07:07.709]  But, I mean, exactly what was she saying to him, and what was he saying while he was being tortured?
[01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:13.172]  Oh, they were trying to get out of him where some...
[01:07:17.361 --> 01:07:20.047]  Of course, he's a white guy.
[01:07:20.067 --> 01:07:21.891]  He's a white guy who controls Al-Qaeda, right?
[01:07:25.001 --> 01:07:32.885]  And then I have Harvard here from their own newspaper saying, quote, those that do not like a new world order are secretly under Al-Qaeda control, period.
[01:07:33.165 --> 01:07:37.347]  You don't like globalism, you don't like losing your job, you don't like losing your guns, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:07:37.667 --> 01:07:38.867]  This is the script, folks.
[01:07:38.887 --> 01:07:43.009]  They're going to blow more stuff up, and then, oh, you secretly work with Al-Qaeda.
[01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:52.734]  And there's going to be all these weak-minded noodleheads that watch shows like Threat Matrix and 24 on Fox, where every show is about torture and every show is about how good it is.
[01:07:53.354 --> 01:07:54.875]  I want people to get something straight.
[01:07:55.435 --> 01:08:00.977]  Our troops, our men, got shot down and put in cages and tortured, and it's wrong!
[01:08:01.257 --> 01:08:03.537]  And Joseph Mingala did it, and it's sick!
[01:08:03.718 --> 01:08:05.738]  And ABC News makes me sick!
[01:08:06.418 --> 01:08:07.979]  So the torture babe, I love it.
[01:08:08.139 --> 01:08:09.099]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.100]  The torture babe.
[01:08:12.661 --> 01:08:15.942]  Just describe exactly what she does to this guy when she's torturing him.
[01:08:16.622 --> 01:08:18.142]  Well, I saw so little of it.
[01:08:19.703 --> 01:08:22.784]  Mostly what I saw was her asking questions and
[01:08:23.621 --> 01:08:27.164]  I guess the torture bit was already done when I flipped on there.
[01:08:27.684 --> 01:08:29.666]  But, like I said, you know, he looked great.
[01:08:29.686 --> 01:08:34.330]  He's just all white, lesions, strapped down and disheveled.
[01:08:35.851 --> 01:08:37.052]  They're loving him.
[01:08:37.072 --> 01:08:45.259]  I mean, do you realize, folks, and I'm asking you this question, how sick it is to have them telling us torture's good?
[01:08:49.062 --> 01:08:51.884]  I mean, they're legitimizing that, sir.
[01:08:52.305 --> 01:08:52.605]  Oh, yeah.
[01:08:53.294 --> 01:08:53.694]  Oh, I know.
[01:08:54.535 --> 01:08:57.257]  And it's the slow acclimation process.
[01:08:57.717 --> 01:08:59.318]  Well, let me tell you why it's so scary.
[01:09:01.059 --> 01:09:05.802]  The April issue of, what is it, Firearms and Weapons of Law Enforcement.
[01:09:05.902 --> 01:09:07.103]  I read this on air like ten times.
[01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:07.783]  It was so incredible.
[01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:15.108]  They had an article written by this Fed for the police, and it was like, torture may become a regular part of law enforcement.
[01:09:15.128 --> 01:09:20.011]  It's been looked down upon, but recently we've understood that if we're the good guys, we can administer it.
[01:09:20.825 --> 01:09:25.768]  And it went on to say, what if a man's got an anthrax bomb about to release and he won't answer questions?
[01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:27.850]  Obviously, torture's needed.
[01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:30.332]  Then I found out it's being taught to cops everywhere.
[01:09:30.872 --> 01:09:35.255]  But notice, there's no real anthrax, there's no real terror, it's always the government.
[01:09:35.695 --> 01:09:38.217]  But see, so now terrorism is throwing an egg.
[01:09:38.557 --> 01:09:39.958]  Terrorism is protesting.
[01:09:40.238 --> 01:09:41.699]  Terrorism is having marijuana.
[01:09:41.739 --> 01:09:48.324]  See, oh, we only torture terrorists and everything's an act of terror, according to Section 802 of the First Patriot Act.
[01:09:49.557 --> 01:09:53.943]  Yeah, and who administers torture and thinks they're some bad guy?
[01:09:54.003 --> 01:09:55.285]  They all think they're good guys.
[01:09:56.606 --> 01:09:57.167]  Well, exactly.
[01:09:57.187 --> 01:09:59.971]  I mean, Joseph Mengele was fighting for the Reich that was under attack.
[01:10:00.965 --> 01:10:03.145]  And, you know, I mean, doing what he did.
[01:10:03.185 --> 01:10:05.406]  He had to advance the medical science, and that's what they said.
[01:10:05.426 --> 01:10:13.248]  And BBC reported that as late as 85, they did hundreds of tests outside Porton Down, out of the countryside, in the military-owned land.
[01:10:13.268 --> 01:10:13.848]  They'd have U.S.
[01:10:13.908 --> 01:10:19.769]  and British troops sit out there in their tanks and in Jeeps, fly over and spray them, and they would die.
[01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:22.029]  They'd kill our troops.
[01:10:22.609 --> 01:10:27.170]  1968, New York subway, biological released, dozens died, the details remain classified.
[01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:28.231]  That's a government admission.
[01:10:28.511 --> 01:10:29.191]  Senate report.
[01:10:29.591 --> 01:10:30.511]  We have a government.
[01:10:30.931 --> 01:10:34.372]  That just kills people just randomly going to work.
[01:10:34.792 --> 01:10:35.972]  And, oh, it's just a test.
[01:10:36.613 --> 01:10:41.414]  They take little children and radiate them, the sons and daughters of military personnel.
[01:10:41.694 --> 01:10:43.254]  Oh, we're going to do a test on your daughter.
[01:10:43.274 --> 01:10:44.595]  They radiate them, kill them.
[01:10:44.815 --> 01:10:49.756]  They give pregnant wives uranium pills just to see what it would do to them in the 50s, 40s.
[01:10:50.636 --> 01:10:52.877]  And we just go, well, we can trust this government now.
[01:10:53.937 --> 01:10:56.438]  You're foolish to think that torture is ever good.
[01:10:58.911 --> 01:11:01.993]  Number one, you can't believe a confession that was gotten by torture.
[01:11:02.153 --> 01:11:04.675]  And you can't believe a government that will carry it out, folks.
[01:11:05.256 --> 01:11:12.541]  Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Ho Chi Minh, Fidel Castro, Nero.
[01:11:12.922 --> 01:11:14.443]  Jesus Christ was tortured.
[01:11:16.385 --> 01:11:17.065]  He was whipped.
[01:11:17.966 --> 01:11:19.147]  He was beaten.
[01:11:20.428 --> 01:11:21.589]  Everything that happened to him.
[01:11:21.789 --> 01:11:22.830]  Was that now good?
[01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:25.492]  We're in the ADL.
[01:11:25.532 --> 01:11:27.093]  He's an anti-Semite and deserves it.
[01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:29.750]  Thanks for the call.
[01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:30.430]  I appreciate it.
[01:11:31.151 --> 01:11:31.891]  And I'm not kidding.
[01:11:31.911 --> 01:11:33.251]  This latest ADL thing.
[01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:37.893]  Folks, I've been criticized for not being against Israel.
[01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:39.594]  I'm not against people of Israel.
[01:11:39.874 --> 01:11:40.954]  I'm not against Jews.
[01:11:40.994 --> 01:11:41.854]  I'm not against Germans.
[01:11:41.874 --> 01:11:43.155]  I'm not against Chinese people.
[01:11:43.535 --> 01:11:46.336]  But I am sick and tired of the ADL and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
[01:11:48.597 --> 01:11:50.257]  I mean, I really am sick of it.
[01:11:51.398 --> 01:11:57.880]  Remember the World Net Daily article in, what was it, back in 2000, Digital Hate 2000, listed thousands of groups.
[01:11:59.813 --> 01:12:01.954]  And it listed Peaceable Texas for firearms rights.
[01:12:01.974 --> 01:12:03.194]  I mean, I know them.
[01:12:03.274 --> 01:12:04.215]  I've been at rallies.
[01:12:04.255 --> 01:12:05.535]  It's black people, white people.
[01:12:05.815 --> 01:12:06.996]  Hey, don't ban our guns.
[01:12:07.116 --> 01:12:08.196]  Nothing to do with a race.
[01:12:09.717 --> 01:12:10.137]  Listed.
[01:12:10.817 --> 01:12:13.078]  All these other gun groups, land rights groups.
[01:12:14.559 --> 01:12:15.699]  I was blown away by it.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.180]  And then there was Steve Voss.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.201]  We played his music, you know.
[01:12:20.681 --> 01:12:25.343]  Bring America back, come together, red, white, and blue, love America.
[01:12:25.423 --> 01:12:27.784]  I mean, whoa, this is really radical.
[01:12:28.439 --> 01:12:34.864]  About as square as it gets, you know, for all the hip-hop folks or the kids out there.
[01:12:38.307 --> 01:12:40.489]  I mean, this is just really old-fashioned stuff.
[01:12:41.596 --> 01:12:42.197]  He's listed.
[01:12:42.237 --> 01:12:44.659]  I remember World Net Daily was saying, hey, Steve Voss ought to sue.
[01:12:44.679 --> 01:12:45.740]  You know, they've been promoters of it.
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:46.880]  We love Steve Voss.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:51.664]  I mean, nothing to do with black people or white people or Arabs or Jews.
[01:12:51.724 --> 01:12:52.845]  I mean, attacks.
[01:12:53.206 --> 01:12:54.707]  It's been turned into a tool.
[01:12:55.367 --> 01:13:03.374]  What's happened to Jews in the past, the horrible things that have happened to all different groups out there, has been taken and basically pimped out to attack good people.
[01:13:03.574 --> 01:13:04.395]  And I'm sick of it.
[01:13:04.675 --> 01:13:05.336]  I'm tired of it.
[01:13:05.536 --> 01:13:10.360]  And then that destroys any memory of people that have been killed by tyrants, like Hitler.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.000]  I mean, look at the ADL.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:15.421]  Oh, Schwarzenegger's good.
[01:13:15.981 --> 01:13:16.861]  Oh, we endorse him.
[01:13:16.901 --> 01:13:18.121]  He has no Nazi ties.
[01:13:18.381 --> 01:13:19.782]  No, he just says, I love Hitler.
[01:13:19.902 --> 01:13:20.802]  I want to be a dictator.
[01:13:21.102 --> 01:13:21.982]  I love Kurt Waldheim.
[01:13:22.002 --> 01:13:23.142]  I don't care if he's a Nazi.
[01:13:23.362 --> 01:13:25.983]  That's on the record in front of a bank of TV cameras!
[01:13:28.823 --> 01:13:41.506]  And then they attack Mel Gibson for a film about a Jew named Jesus Christ who stood up to the corrupt establishment, the Jews and the Romans, and the government, and who was killed.
[01:13:44.381 --> 01:13:45.625]  And they've got the nerve.
[01:13:46.468 --> 01:13:47.994]  I'm not going to put up with it anymore.
[01:13:49.585 --> 01:13:53.026]  I remember the New York Times put me in a big article.
[01:13:53.166 --> 01:13:54.527]  It mentioned Bin Laden.
[01:13:54.587 --> 01:13:55.847]  It mentioned white supremacist groups.
[01:13:55.887 --> 01:14:02.809]  And then there's Alex Jones who believes there's a Bohemian Grove where occult rituals go on.
[01:14:03.209 --> 01:14:16.534]  The New York Times knew that the San Francisco Chronicle, the press democrat in Santa Rosa, knew that the Bohemian Grove club had already been interviewed by World of Wonder and aired on British and Japanese TV and now on this television.
[01:14:16.554 --> 01:14:17.054]  They didn't care.
[01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:23.692]  They just said, it's Alex Jones, anti-Semitic, the article said.
[01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:25.553]  And at that point, I'm like, hey!
[01:14:27.514 --> 01:14:28.595]  I'm mad at you now!
[01:14:28.935 --> 01:14:33.418]  Not because you're Jewish, but because you're demonizing me for no reason!
[01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:42.723]  And then what happens is, whenever real bad things are happening to any group, they've already... I mean, it's like...
[01:14:44.176 --> 01:14:46.698]  A lot of black folks come up with fake charges of racism.
[01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:51.923]  You know, on college campuses, they've been caught planning evidence of racism, planning fake letters just to get attention.
[01:14:52.203 --> 01:14:54.845]  And then when something really bad happens to a black person, nobody's going to listen.
[01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:56.546]  Same thing, you know, it's crying wolf.
[01:14:57.087 --> 01:14:57.848]  I'm sick of it.
[01:14:58.108 --> 01:14:59.549]  I'm trying to save this country.
[01:14:59.789 --> 01:15:02.351]  Mel Gibson's trying to put out wholesome films like The Patriot.
[01:15:02.571 --> 01:15:03.632]  He got attacked for that.
[01:15:04.053 --> 01:15:04.853]  I'm sick of it.
[01:15:04.953 --> 01:15:06.275]  Leave Steve Voss alone.
[01:15:06.655 --> 01:15:08.717]  Leave Peaceable Texas for Firearms Rights alone.
[01:15:08.977 --> 01:15:10.238]  And leave me alone.
[01:15:12.344 --> 01:15:13.044]  I'm sick of it.
[01:15:13.105 --> 01:15:19.548]  And stop endorsing a megalomaniacal Nazi pig like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:15:19.728 --> 01:15:21.469]  That's what makes it so sick.
[01:15:23.451 --> 01:15:25.212]  That's what pushes it over the top.
[01:15:25.272 --> 01:15:27.333]  I mean, it's just pure politics.
[01:15:27.633 --> 01:15:32.336]  It's just pure demonization using the deaths of all those people that were killed.
[01:15:33.637 --> 01:15:40.781]  All those Jews that were killed wrongfully using their deaths as an excuse to attack people that are trying to stop the Fourth Reich.
[01:15:43.965 --> 01:15:45.165]  And that's what's going on here.
[01:15:45.245 --> 01:15:46.105]  I'm sick of it.
[01:15:46.145 --> 01:15:47.186]  Spencer in Ohio.
[01:15:47.206 --> 01:15:47.946]  Go ahead, Spencer.
[01:15:48.866 --> 01:15:53.647]  Jesus conquered death, hell, and the grave, Alex, so he conquered torture, too.
[01:15:54.187 --> 01:16:00.168]  Well, no, that's the point I'm making, but I mean, now they're saying, they're saying the New Testament's anti-Semitic in Europe, trying to ban it.
[01:16:00.248 --> 01:16:00.928]  BBC!
[01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:05.529]  Well, why would Mr. Gibson cut his movie all to pieces?
[01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:08.930]  Albert Hitchcock never cut his films up.
[01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:17.330]  Look, all I know is that... Jack Ruby's alive.
[01:16:18.651 --> 01:16:19.711]  Okay, that's interesting.
[01:16:19.751 --> 01:16:20.592]  How does that tie together?
[01:16:21.112 --> 01:16:30.917]  Well, I was called by the Sheriff's Department and said that I was accused of telephone harassment for calling Joe Finan's program yesterday and saying Jack Ruby is alive.
[01:16:33.058 --> 01:16:37.020]  You know, Spencer, that's a wild statement, but I want to hear where you're going with this when we get back.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:37.460]  Stay there.
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:38.961]  More calls and a bunch of news coming up.
[01:16:39.734 --> 01:16:41.493]  We will talk about the JFK assassination.
[01:16:43.064 --> 01:16:46.967]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:16:47.187 --> 01:16:59.477]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:16:59.897 --> 01:17:00.297]  The U.S.
[01:17:00.357 --> 01:17:05.922]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:17:06.342 --> 01:17:08.544]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:17:10.405 --> 01:17:10.866]  We're good to go.
[01:17:31.238 --> 01:17:31.679]  We're good to go.
[01:17:42.834 --> 01:17:53.559]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:17:53.739 --> 01:18:01.342]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.

[01:18:05.244 --> 01:18:05.864]  We're good to go.
[01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:29.494]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:18:29.734 --> 01:18:33.677]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:18:42.583 --> 01:18:43.364]  Oh my God!
[01:18:43.644 --> 01:18:48.349]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:49.310]  Yes, it's true.

[01:20:48.397 --> 01:20:49.359]  LBJ!
[01:20:49.899 --> 01:20:52.282]  Kennedy White House killed U.S.
[01:20:52.563 --> 01:20:52.943]  ally.
[01:20:55.507 --> 01:20:58.430]  Tape support new book showing who really assassinated JFK.
[01:20:59.412 --> 01:21:03.317]  That's from WorldNetDaily, up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:21:04.718 --> 01:21:06.461]  The White House press secretary's daddy.
[01:21:07.722 --> 01:21:13.843]  Mr. McLennan, who worked in and out of government, was in and around all this, has already brought out information in a new book that we've already brought out on this show.
[01:21:13.883 --> 01:21:15.624]  I mean, we've had LBJ's mistress on.
[01:21:15.644 --> 01:21:17.364]  We've had a bunch of the players on.
[01:21:17.384 --> 01:21:19.225]  We know who some of the killers are.
[01:21:19.245 --> 01:21:21.805]  One of them's in federal prison right now for killing another judge.
[01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:24.106]  It goes on and on.
[01:21:24.306 --> 01:21:34.288]  And to link the article here, that, yeah, there's these phone conversations backing up, phone conversations that just got released.
[01:21:35.453 --> 01:21:45.078]  Right on time with this book that's got LBJ in there managing the killing of JFK.
[01:21:45.118 --> 01:21:48.660]  So, interesting information there since you brought up Jack Ruby.
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:52.662]  Now, Jack Ruby was already, what, 50, 60 years old, wasn't he?
[01:21:53.063 --> 01:21:54.403]  Spencer, he'd be pretty old now.
[01:21:54.423 --> 01:21:57.025]  What would he be, like 100 years old or 95 years old?
[01:21:57.365 --> 01:21:59.006]  Yeah, he'd look like Frank Carlucci.
[01:22:01.264 --> 01:22:02.926]  All right, so you're joking around.
[01:22:02.966 --> 01:22:04.328]  Why are you saying Jack Ruby's still alive?
[01:22:04.788 --> 01:22:09.113]  Oh, well, actually, it's in a book called Final Judgment.
[01:22:09.353 --> 01:22:11.195]  He might have been alive 15, 20 years ago.
[01:22:11.956 --> 01:22:13.418]  Michael Collins, yeah, that's true.
[01:22:13.678 --> 01:22:17.022]  Michael Collins Piper, which was referred to me by Professor Tex Marr's
[01:22:17.518 --> 01:22:21.019]  And in this book, he says there was no autopsy photos of Ruby.
[01:22:21.359 --> 01:22:23.759]  Well, I know they staged a lot of deaths, like McVeigh.
[01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:27.040]  Even mainstream news said he was still breathing when he was wheeled out.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.500]  I totally believe that.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:29.860]  That whole thing was staged.
[01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:34.861]  Yeah, and that was not actually Ruby who shot Oswald in the Dallas police basement at all.
[01:22:34.901 --> 01:22:39.022]  It was an actor, and it could have been actor John Carradine.
[01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:44.143]  I know that the father of an actor...
[01:22:45.051 --> 01:22:45.712]  What was it?
[01:22:45.752 --> 01:22:52.917]  Charles Harrelson, father of Woody Harrelson, was photographed by the Dallas Times-Herald, and now defunct by the Dallas Morning News VLOG.
[01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:56.791]  Yeah, he was behind the grass.
[01:22:56.811 --> 01:22:58.572]  He knulled this big old 6'4 guy.
[01:22:58.972 --> 01:22:59.933]  It's a classic photo.
[01:22:59.953 --> 01:23:04.916]  It looks like CIA all the way with his cap, and they got the rifle and all that, but the cops released him.
[01:23:05.216 --> 01:23:08.438]  Yeah, so I called up Joe Finan's radio program yesterday.
[01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:09.959]  I said, Jack Ruby's alive.
[01:23:10.379 --> 01:23:14.782]  And so he reported me to the Sheriff's Department, and they accused me of telephone harassment.
[01:23:14.922 --> 01:23:15.422]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:23:15.462 --> 01:23:17.443]  If somebody gives a phone number out...
[01:23:20.567 --> 01:23:21.427]  That's ridiculous.
[01:23:22.408 --> 01:23:23.809]  I don't know who this talk show host is.
[01:23:23.829 --> 01:23:24.589]  I don't want to get into it.
[01:23:24.609 --> 01:23:25.510]  Thanks for the call.
[01:23:25.850 --> 01:23:26.731]  I appreciate it.
[01:23:27.291 --> 01:23:31.334]  I'm not really, Spencer, about gossiping about some of their little penny-ante broadcasts.
[01:23:31.894 --> 01:23:32.995]  Or maybe a great broadcast.
[01:23:33.015 --> 01:23:33.435]  I don't know.
[01:23:33.535 --> 01:23:35.056]  I don't understand telephone harassment.
[01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:35.877]  That does sound crazy.
[01:23:36.837 --> 01:23:38.999]  Let's go on now to the calls.
[01:23:39.039 --> 01:23:44.522]  Let's talk to John Tennessee, then Israel, and a bunch of other people that are holding.
[01:23:44.682 --> 01:23:45.283]  Go ahead, John.
[01:23:45.922 --> 01:23:50.526]  Yeah, Nixon was at the same meeting as LBJ plotting the murder of JFK.
[01:23:50.546 --> 01:23:51.167]  Yeah, I know that.
[01:23:51.187 --> 01:23:52.528]  I submit it.
[01:23:52.548 --> 01:23:54.630]  I've had the mess for a son.
[01:23:54.690 --> 01:24:01.536]  The third degree is synonymous with torture and originated with the initiation rituals for the third degree of Freemasonry.
[01:24:02.156 --> 01:24:05.239]  And, of course, it's just mind control using physical torture with
[01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:13.390]  And that's the essence of the Red Terror and the Nazi Terror is torture.
[01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:21.295]  And now your government on news channels and TV and in print is saying torture's good and the TV dramas, every channel, torture's good.
[01:24:21.615 --> 01:24:23.176]  This is sick and dangerous.
[01:24:23.856 --> 01:24:30.500]  And I wanted to add that Mel Gibson's alleged quote on Fox News service saying he wanted to cut the heads off his critics of his movie.
[01:24:30.921 --> 01:24:33.182]  That makes sense if what you're saying is true that
[01:24:33.775 --> 01:24:36.115]  He is getting death threats for making the movie.
[01:24:36.515 --> 01:24:43.237]  Fox, of course, censored the death threat part and just gave the one-sided Bill Gibson quote and didn't quote any of the death threats.
[01:24:43.337 --> 01:24:45.377]  Well, Fox doesn't want to distribute.
[01:24:45.397 --> 01:24:46.997]  A lot of times they do distribute his films.
[01:24:47.717 --> 01:24:50.758]  I mean, look at Fox TV, the trashiest stuff out there.
[01:24:51.058 --> 01:24:53.438]  That's our neocon conservatism.
[01:24:53.798 --> 01:24:56.119]  Conservatives, aren't you sick of being co-opted?
[01:24:56.619 --> 01:24:57.339]  I know I am.
[01:24:57.539 --> 01:25:03.020]  Well, isn't the owner of Fox a Jew, and why would a Jew want to distribute the passion play?
[01:25:03.857 --> 01:25:09.140]  Well, I know there's a lot of Christians who are Jewish, and I know there's a lot of them in Israel.
[01:25:09.841 --> 01:25:14.604]  And so, I mean, Israel's a bunch of different camps of different people, just like in America.
[01:25:15.244 --> 01:25:20.047]  I mean, you know, old Germans aren't bad because, you know, Adolf Hitler's off doing something.
[01:25:20.507 --> 01:25:26.031]  But there is a camp out there that wants to have this racial or tribal fight going on
[01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:33.951]  And when you study the New World Order and the Illuminati, it transcends Germans and Jews and Chinese.
[01:25:33.991 --> 01:25:35.692]  It just gets down to evil people.
[01:25:36.152 --> 01:25:41.853]  But obviously the ADL just is totally out of control, attacking Mel Gibson, calling him an anti-Semite with no proof.
[01:25:41.873 --> 01:25:43.713]  I don't think that's going to hurt the ADL.
[01:25:43.733 --> 01:25:45.054]  I think that's going to backfire on him.
[01:25:45.074 --> 01:25:45.614]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:46.234 --> 01:25:52.355]  A lot of people love Mel Gibson, and he's never done anything to anybody who's Jewish, and it's despicable.
[01:25:52.395 --> 01:25:54.135]  And the ADL has lost quite a few lawsuits.
[01:25:54.756 --> 01:25:56.396]  They're losing all credibility right now.
[01:25:58.214 --> 01:25:59.775]  And they're making enemies, by the way.
[01:25:59.915 --> 01:26:01.776]  I mean, I've never even talked about the group.
[01:26:01.816 --> 01:26:05.518]  I'm sick of being, you know, attacked by them for just stupid stuff.
[01:26:06.399 --> 01:26:09.601]  I said, the government may be involved in the space shuttle.
[01:26:10.721 --> 01:26:13.683]  And they go, look at this obviously anti-Semitic remark.
[01:26:13.783 --> 01:26:14.964]  It was just, what?
[01:26:16.485 --> 01:26:17.786]  They're going, I believe in freedom.
[01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:20.087]  Oh my gosh, he's anti-Jew!
[01:26:20.167 --> 01:26:21.208]  You know, it's just like, what?
[01:26:21.728 --> 01:26:24.430]  And then you respond to it and they go, see, see, he's talking about Jews.
[01:26:25.690 --> 01:26:26.771]  Well, I don't think so.
[01:26:27.689 --> 01:26:28.810]  We'll come back and take more calls.
[01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:29.651]  I've got a bunch of news.
[01:26:33.215 --> 01:26:34.136]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.616 --> 01:26:36.218]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.139 --> 01:26:39.842]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.465 --> 01:26:44.486]  What would you rather do?
[01:26:44.847 --> 01:26:50.272]  Spend 10 minutes learning how to become debt-free within two years or spend the next 30 years wishing you had?
[01:26:50.292 --> 01:26:56.998]  The debt experts at StartOverToday.com can usually settle your debt without bankruptcy.

[01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:16.191]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:27:16.911 --> 01:27:25.577]  My final comment about the ADL attacking Bill Gibson and the Simon Wiesenthal Center doing it while they defend that Nazi creature, Schwarzenegger.
[01:27:26.398 --> 01:27:27.779]  He says he loves Hitler, folks.
[01:27:27.799 --> 01:27:34.463]  He admires Hitler, wants to be a dictator, loves Kirk of all time, doesn't care if he's a Nazi, campaigns for him.
[01:27:36.064 --> 01:27:37.725]  I find that very offensive.
[01:27:37.985 --> 01:27:39.746]  I don't like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:27:40.287 --> 01:27:43.509]  He's pro-abortion, open borders, anti-gun.
[01:27:44.764 --> 01:27:49.607]  Booked in with the Bohemian Grove, Wasp Satanic Society.
[01:27:49.627 --> 01:27:51.267]  Ooh, look, I'm attacking the wasp now.
[01:27:51.608 --> 01:27:53.829]  I'm anti, I hate white people.
[01:27:54.349 --> 01:27:56.070]  No, I hate corrupt people.
[01:27:59.832 --> 01:28:08.576]  And, I mean, basically, you just go, if you're the government, you just go rent out the ADL, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and they'll demonize whoever you want.
[01:28:08.596 --> 01:28:13.759]  I mean, almost everybody I've ever seen demonized by these groups had never said anything.
[01:28:14.953 --> 01:28:16.454]  About anybody Jewish.
[01:28:16.514 --> 01:28:19.016]  And they're creating hatred.
[01:28:20.097 --> 01:28:22.198]  I think Jewish folks out there should be very upset about this.
[01:28:22.218 --> 01:28:22.818]  And I know they are.
[01:28:23.058 --> 01:28:25.920]  I know Aaron Zellman, a good friend of mine, is very upset.
[01:28:26.481 --> 01:28:27.922]  Jews of Preservation of Firearms.
[01:28:28.542 --> 01:28:33.685]  Henry McCall, who's a famous professor and invented a bunch of board games and stuff.
[01:28:35.066 --> 01:28:36.127]  He's really upset about it.
[01:28:36.167 --> 01:28:37.448]  He's saying, hey, you stop this.
[01:28:37.468 --> 01:28:41.451]  This is a globalist plan to continue anti-Semitism.
[01:28:41.511 --> 01:28:42.031]  And it is.
[01:28:43.052 --> 01:28:43.512]  Folks, this is...
[01:28:44.170 --> 01:28:46.330]  This is wheels within wheels within wheels.
[01:28:47.351 --> 01:28:48.531]  And I am tired of it.
[01:28:48.551 --> 01:28:52.151]  I mean, Mel Gibson is a good, wholesome person.
[01:28:52.932 --> 01:28:55.292]  His family, just incredibly good, decent people.
[01:28:55.812 --> 01:28:58.793]  Believe me, they're just amazing, good people.
[01:28:58.873 --> 01:29:01.433]  They just radiate a wholesomeness.
[01:29:02.173 --> 01:29:03.253]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:29:03.273 --> 01:29:05.174]  I mean, Hollywood finally found a movie.
[01:29:05.374 --> 01:29:06.434]  They're not going to distribute it.
[01:29:06.494 --> 01:29:07.374]  No one's going to take it.
[01:29:07.534 --> 01:29:08.574]  It's going to be boycotted.
[01:29:09.194 --> 01:29:12.175]  A film about the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life.
[01:29:12.757 --> 01:29:20.660]  That incredible story, the passion, just really makes me angry, folks.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:28.604]  And then to see all these real Nazis just running around running things, that makes me very, very angry.
[01:29:28.984 --> 01:29:32.465]  Let's take two more calls, and that's all I'm doing because I want to cover news for the rest of the show.
[01:29:33.426 --> 01:29:35.086]  Let's talk to Israel in Texas.
[01:29:35.166 --> 01:29:36.007]  Israel, go ahead.
[01:29:36.527 --> 01:29:37.667]  Hello, Alex.
[01:29:38.067 --> 01:29:41.609]  Last Friday on Fox, I hate to admit it, but I watched their programming.
[01:29:42.558 --> 01:29:52.381]  And in the first program called Louie, a comedy about a Puerto Rican donut shop owner, he said that this is America, you better learn Spanish.
[01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:59.103]  And then following in Boston Public, one of the teachers walked into a physics class speaking in Spanish.
[01:29:59.903 --> 01:30:03.024]  And one of the kids objected and said, this is a physics class.
[01:30:03.744 --> 01:30:05.304]  None of us speak Spanish.
[01:30:05.404 --> 01:30:07.565]  And then the teacher said, well, that's disgusting.
[01:30:09.318 --> 01:30:12.182]  And let me break this down, divide and conquer.
[01:30:12.322 --> 01:30:18.729]  Big banks, old white men, publicly funded La Raza, which means the race, folks.
[01:30:18.789 --> 01:30:20.732]  Again, I'm sick of real races getting away with it.
[01:30:22.033 --> 01:30:26.799]  Metcha, you name it, who say all whites out, that's what Metcha says.
[01:30:27.643 --> 01:30:29.024]  Now, all whites out.
[01:30:29.044 --> 01:30:37.230]  Well, you better get out of Mexico, then, because it's your upper-class, inbred white people running it, as usual, using racial politics to control you.
[01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:40.732]  And they're doing this to balkanize and break the country up.
[01:30:41.473 --> 01:30:44.315]  And they want to speak in 50 different languages where none of us can communicate.
[01:30:44.635 --> 01:30:53.741]  They want all these different people in different racial divides and groups to control its basic imperial politics, as Brzezinski said in his book, The Grand Chessboard.
[01:30:53.761 --> 01:30:54.622]  Absolutely.
[01:30:54.642 --> 01:30:54.942]  Absolutely.
[01:30:55.524 --> 01:30:57.665]  And one last thing about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:30:58.286 --> 01:30:59.867]  Where does his loyalty really lie?
[01:30:59.947 --> 01:31:05.870]  He has dual citizenship with the United States and with Austria, and when it really came down to it, who would he support?
[01:31:07.011 --> 01:31:10.853]  He would support himself, he would sell us out, and he would support the old Nazi regime.
[01:31:11.513 --> 01:31:17.076]  Are you anti-Semitic because you're attacking somebody that's been endorsed by the Simon Wiesenthal Center?
[01:31:17.116 --> 01:31:21.919]  You attack any politician endorsed by the New World Order, and you're anti-Semitic.
[01:31:22.609 --> 01:31:26.030]  You do not talk bad about Hitler, buddy, or you're anti-Semitic.
[01:31:26.170 --> 01:31:27.070]  Do you understand me?
[01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.910]  Yes, sir.
[01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:29.010]  Good.
[01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:31.291]  I would be very good, excuse me.
[01:31:32.031 --> 01:31:35.052]  Good, you will learn how to be my slave.
[01:31:37.152 --> 01:31:38.072]  Don't you understand?
[01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:39.933]  We have two rules for people.
[01:31:40.213 --> 01:31:42.353]  You are real Nazi, you do real good.
[01:31:42.573 --> 01:31:45.954]  I'm going to get between a German and a Russian accent, sorry.
[01:31:47.114 --> 01:31:49.115]  Oh, ask me now, believe me later.
[01:31:49.755 --> 01:31:50.935]  I like steroids.
[01:31:52.228 --> 01:31:53.729]  I'd like to be a dictator.
[01:31:53.769 --> 01:31:55.411]  I always admired Hitler.
[01:31:55.931 --> 01:31:58.234]  I don't care about this Nazi stuff with Kurt.
[01:31:58.654 --> 01:32:00.095]  Maria and I love him.
[01:32:00.476 --> 01:32:03.358]  That's why I'm going to Austria to campaign for him.
[01:32:03.919 --> 01:32:09.163]  The former Secretary General of the United Nations noticed that the UN really likes Nazis.
[01:32:09.684 --> 01:32:10.965]  They like me, too.
[01:32:11.846 --> 01:32:13.788]  I go to the Grove and do the rituals.
[01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:17.471]  It's incredible.
[01:32:18.658 --> 01:32:19.359]  The New York Times.
[01:32:19.499 --> 01:32:22.921]  Alex Jones believes there's a bohemian grove where rituals are done.
[01:32:23.681 --> 01:32:24.862]  Alex Jones believes it?
[01:32:27.544 --> 01:32:29.285]  Alex Jones believes it?
[01:32:30.285 --> 01:32:31.786]  I believe the sun came up this morning.
[01:32:31.826 --> 01:32:32.527]  I'm sick of it!
[01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:33.507]  Remember all those years?
[01:32:33.828 --> 01:32:36.029]  These insane kooks believe in a new world order.
[01:32:36.069 --> 01:32:37.010]  The kook detector.
[01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:39.331]  Anyone that believes in a new world order is crazy.
[01:32:40.772 --> 01:32:42.053]  What your neocons told you.
[01:32:44.019 --> 01:32:54.612]  And then now, Harvard, I've got the Harvard article right here, Harvard Gazette says, well, now Al-Qaeda secretly controls the right-wing groups in America, those that, quote, don't like a new world order.
[01:32:55.733 --> 01:33:00.579]  That's right, there is a new world order, but it's good, and you're with Al-Qaeda if you're against it!
[01:33:03.519 --> 01:33:04.299]  That's all they've got.
[01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:07.260]  I'm for freedom, sovereignty, private property rights, Second Amendment.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.720]  You're with Al-Qaeda!
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:17.582]  They're actually sitting around at big symposiums at Harvard with all these government officials going, well, Al-Qaeda controls the patriot movement.
[01:33:17.622 --> 01:33:20.883]  They're going to be getting us any second now.
[01:33:20.963 --> 01:33:22.443]  They believe the New World Order is bad.
[01:33:22.503 --> 01:33:22.923]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:33:23.183 --> 01:33:24.704]  I thought the New World Order didn't exist.
[01:33:28.825 --> 01:33:29.745]  Steve in Colorado.
[01:33:29.785 --> 01:33:30.545]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:33:31.181 --> 01:33:32.743]  Yeah, hello there, Alex.
[01:33:33.083 --> 01:33:38.350]  Well, hey, all those upper crusty folks that hang around like Harvard and everything, they're all CFR types anyway.
[01:33:39.031 --> 01:33:41.774]  But I had three questions I wanted to ask you.
[01:33:42.195 --> 01:33:46.841]  The guy that you mentioned earlier, I think you said he was British, Mike Meekin?
[01:33:46.861 --> 01:33:48.002]  Is that right?
[01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:49.063]  That used to be with the IMF?
[01:33:49.104 --> 01:33:50.085]  Michael Meacher.
[01:33:50.859 --> 01:33:51.279]  Mature?
[01:33:51.699 --> 01:33:53.120]  Mature, depending on how you want to pronounce it.
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:55.000]  How are you spelling that?
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.260]  Do you have that article?
[01:33:56.761 --> 01:33:58.821]  Yeah, it's on prisonplanet.com.
[01:33:58.861 --> 01:34:00.381]  It's on infowars.com.
[01:34:00.962 --> 01:34:02.622]  And this is just a message to Paul Watson.
[01:34:02.662 --> 01:34:04.883]  I keep giving the guy more to do, and he does a fabulous job.
[01:34:05.223 --> 01:34:06.723]  I want a PNAC archive.
[01:34:07.583 --> 01:34:11.204]  But go to, what is it, pnac.org, Project for a New American Century.
[01:34:12.164 --> 01:34:13.805]  It was the 2000 report.
[01:34:13.845 --> 01:34:14.465]  They did hundreds.
[01:34:15.265 --> 01:34:18.326]  By Cheney and Rumsfeld, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[01:34:19.039 --> 01:34:22.942]  And that's called the race-specific bioweapons, how good they are to kill certain races.
[01:34:23.342 --> 01:34:25.144]  It's so good, Cheney said.
[01:34:25.384 --> 01:34:26.485]  But again, that's not a problem.
[01:34:26.505 --> 01:34:28.046]  The ADL has no problem with that.
[01:34:28.066 --> 01:34:31.188]  Directly out of Joseph Mingala's mouth, but it's okay.
[01:34:31.388 --> 01:34:33.350]  Here he gets Mingala, you're an anti-Semite.
[01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:36.452]  But, uh, so we've got that going on over there.
[01:34:37.092 --> 01:34:53.249]  And we've got him saying Pearl Harbor was great, we need more Pearl Harbors, but that's in that particular document, and Michael Meacher, the big energy slash environment minister, said this is a bunch of garbage, I'm going public, they planned all this, they're behind it, in like a 10-page article he wrote for the London Guardian.
[01:34:54.069 --> 01:34:57.373]  Okay, and yeah, so do you have his article?
[01:34:57.633 --> 01:34:59.635]  Yeah, we're like a newspaper.
[01:35:01.302 --> 01:35:07.866]  So Infowars.com and ImprisonedPlanet.com post an edition every day of news.
[01:35:08.347 --> 01:35:09.287]  And then there's an archive.
[01:35:09.607 --> 01:35:13.690]  So you have to go back and, just like a stack of newspapers at your house, click back through and find it.
[01:35:14.071 --> 01:35:16.452]  I'll tell you, we posted it three weeks ago.
[01:35:16.953 --> 01:35:20.015]  We reposted it on September 11th on both websites.
[01:35:20.275 --> 01:35:23.277]  So it should be in the archives on September 11th or September 10th or 12th.
[01:35:23.577 --> 01:35:25.219]  One of those days, it's right there.
[01:35:25.539 --> 01:35:27.960]  Go to the London Guardian, type in the War on Terror.
[01:35:28.301 --> 01:35:29.882]  This War on Terror is a hoax.
[01:35:30.362 --> 01:35:31.142]  That was his article.
[01:35:31.282 --> 01:35:31.563]  Yeah.
[01:35:31.763 --> 01:35:32.683]  But why read that?
[01:35:32.723 --> 01:35:35.364]  Why not just go read the PNAC document?
[01:35:35.944 --> 01:35:36.584]  Yeah, okay.
[01:35:37.044 --> 01:35:38.585]  And I want to read that in particular.
[01:35:38.625 --> 01:35:48.409]  And then the one that you mentioned about the CIA instructing the World Bank and the IMF, we're in a 73 document.
[01:35:48.429 --> 01:35:49.249]  Where can that be found?
[01:35:49.289 --> 01:35:50.930]  That is at the Library of Congress.
[01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:52.110]  We have a link to it.
[01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:53.851]  We've linked to PDF files.
[01:35:53.891 --> 01:35:54.531]  We have linked to...
[01:35:55.925 --> 01:35:57.726]  Okay, so that would be under government docs then?
[01:35:57.826 --> 01:35:59.908]  Well, I don't know if we got into that set.
[01:35:59.948 --> 01:36:00.828]  We're a small staff.
[01:36:00.888 --> 01:36:03.030]  Paul Watson does prisonplanet.com.
[01:36:03.570 --> 01:36:05.371]  My wife does infowars.com.
[01:36:06.292 --> 01:36:09.634]  And that's why the sites have different looks and a little bit different information.
[01:36:10.155 --> 01:36:13.076]  Generally, we all kind of think alike, so it's basically the same type of news.
[01:36:13.557 --> 01:36:21.462]  Same areas covered, police state, technocracy, enslavement, bioweapons, New World Order, end of sovereignty, Second Amendment.
[01:36:21.482 --> 01:36:22.583]  Those are the types that we focus on.
[01:36:22.623 --> 01:36:24.564]  But it's all there, sir.
[01:36:24.624 --> 01:36:25.725]  It's all there daily.
[01:36:26.579 --> 01:36:26.859]  Okay.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.401]  Unfortunately, I have to go to the library.
[01:36:30.701 --> 01:36:49.731]  But anyway, I don't know if you heard the news item about when Paul Bremer was testifying before the Senate committee, and he said this delightful statement by him that said, well, guess who gets to fund Iraq's outstanding debt?
[01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:56.174]  Due to international law, the U.S., of course, read taxpayers, get to fund...
[01:36:57.015 --> 01:37:00.097]  Iraq payments to foreign countries that they owe.
[01:37:01.058 --> 01:37:04.481]  I don't know if you heard that, but that was... Well, yeah, the whole country's going into receivership.
[01:37:04.981 --> 01:37:06.382]  There are no bids allowed.
[01:37:06.402 --> 01:37:10.005]  To have a job, you've got to wear an RFID bracelet.
[01:37:10.445 --> 01:37:14.748]  Halliburton goons will have you loaded on trucks, bags put on your heads, take you to a slave labor camp.
[01:37:14.888 --> 01:37:15.809]  This is admitted, folks.
[01:37:16.269 --> 01:37:17.270]  Slave labor camps.
[01:37:18.331 --> 01:37:22.954]  And, I mean, the globalists just grabbed 21 million slaves and $4 trillion in oil.
[01:37:24.575 --> 01:37:25.355]  Pretty amazing.
[01:37:25.856 --> 01:37:30.958]  And before they were getting a couple thousand a month, a couple hundred a month, depending on what job they had, pretty high standard of living.
[01:37:31.298 --> 01:37:32.638]  They get $20 a month.
[01:37:32.658 --> 01:37:34.399]  That's the highest paying job under Halliburton.
[01:37:35.259 --> 01:37:37.200]  And it's all under its subsidiaries, everything.
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.141]  You can't sell.
[01:37:38.161 --> 01:37:43.843]  There was an AP article, people getting arrested for selling pantyhose, beer, anything.
[01:37:43.883 --> 01:37:46.564]  And it showed hundreds of men being loaded on trucks, bags on their head.
[01:37:46.744 --> 01:37:47.404]  They're terrorists.
[01:37:47.724 --> 01:37:49.345]  They're out there selling stuff for their families.
[01:37:50.394 --> 01:38:05.544]  And then I hear the lying socialist neocons, the enemies of everything American, on the radio going, the Iraqis have freedom to sell out what they want now, and sweatshops aren't so bad, and genetically modified food's pretty good.
[01:38:06.485 --> 01:38:08.166]  They're advertisements for death.
[01:38:08.406 --> 01:38:10.508]  The co-op chief, they make me so mad.
[01:38:10.528 --> 01:38:11.228]  Oh, yeah.
[01:38:11.248 --> 01:38:14.290]  They really are whores of the press because they just...
[01:38:19.630 --> 01:38:24.313]  They just hire themselves out for whatever the government... Exactly, but they act holier than thou.
[01:38:24.353 --> 01:38:26.955]  We're exposing the media bias here.
[01:38:26.996 --> 01:38:28.577]  No, you're exposing your left hand.
[01:38:28.857 --> 01:38:30.098]  You're the dirty right hand.
[01:38:31.279 --> 01:38:41.307]  And then also the bottom line to all this spending, all this kind of freewheeling spending of the government and everything, the bottom line is just to get rid of the middle class.
[01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:43.570]  To tax us out of existence.
[01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:44.631]  Ron Paul said it.
[01:38:44.691 --> 01:38:45.752]  It's the admitted policy.
[01:38:45.812 --> 01:38:47.433]  Destroy the minds of the school children.
[01:38:47.733 --> 01:38:49.074]  Admitted Department of Education.
[01:38:49.334 --> 01:38:50.415]  Take your private property.
[01:38:50.475 --> 01:38:51.756]  Totally enslave you folks.
[01:38:51.956 --> 01:38:53.877]  And it's all under public safety.
[01:38:54.037 --> 01:38:56.419]  We have to torture people now for public safety.
[01:38:56.919 --> 01:38:58.420]  Yeah, it's just amazing.
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:05.405]  But yeah, they're trying to tax the middle class out of existence because that way then you have the elite and then you have all the worker bees at the bottom.
[01:39:05.485 --> 01:39:08.307]  That's part of their economic plan there.
[01:39:09.188 --> 01:39:09.829]  Well, hey, thanks.
[01:39:10.129 --> 01:39:11.090]  Hey, thank you, my friend.
[01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:12.791]  I really do appreciate the call.
[01:39:13.352 --> 01:39:15.353]  No more calls because I want to hit a bunch of final news.
[01:39:16.894 --> 01:39:18.616]  Here in the last 14 minutes we've got here.
[01:39:19.456 --> 01:39:25.101]  Before I do that, though, I mean, I really have gotten to the point where I don't even plug my videos in books anymore, and this is how we operate.
[01:39:25.381 --> 01:39:26.242]  That's secondary, though.
[01:39:26.262 --> 01:39:27.323]  The films are excellent.
[01:39:27.723 --> 01:39:28.784]  They're waking people up.
[01:39:28.924 --> 01:39:37.351]  You need to have America Destroyed by Design, Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror.
[01:39:38.064 --> 01:39:41.228]  I mentioned Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, Police State's Retotal Enslavement.
[01:39:41.869 --> 01:39:43.010]  All these films are excellent.
[01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:44.071]  They're all over two hours.
[01:39:44.092 --> 01:39:45.253]  Some are two hours and five minutes.
[01:39:45.273 --> 01:39:46.935]  Some are two hours and 40 minutes.
[01:39:46.955 --> 01:39:48.677]  I only have one film on DVD.
[01:39:48.697 --> 01:39:50.479]  That's Road to Tyranny, 170 minutes.
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:52.442]  It's also on VHS.
[01:39:53.203 --> 01:39:57.228]  But we still use VHS because, believe it or not, they're trying to force a transfer over to DVD.
[01:39:58.354 --> 01:40:00.155]  But still, more people have VCRs.
[01:40:00.175 --> 01:40:03.836]  It's still easier to copy and still easier to get out to people without problems.
[01:40:04.336 --> 01:40:07.178]  We'll be offering more on DVD in the future, but not now.
[01:40:07.518 --> 01:40:08.038]  Support us.
[01:40:08.058 --> 01:40:08.898]  Get it on VHS.
[01:40:08.918 --> 01:40:10.099]  Get the Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[01:40:10.939 --> 01:40:11.439]  Don't wait.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:13.280]  Take Road to Tyranny.
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:15.401]  We've got FEMA saying all Christians are enemies of the government.
[01:40:15.421 --> 01:40:16.601]  We'll be putting camps, basically.
[01:40:16.621 --> 01:40:18.642]  They say all Christians are enemies of the government or terrorists.
[01:40:18.682 --> 01:40:19.542]  You see what they do to terrorists.
[01:40:20.363 --> 01:40:21.903]  All Founding Fathers are terrorists, period.
[01:40:21.943 --> 01:40:23.204]  They list Founding Fathers.
[01:40:24.492 --> 01:40:25.312]  The training manuals.
[01:40:25.332 --> 01:40:26.132]  Defenders of the U.S.
[01:40:26.172 --> 01:40:26.813]  Constitution.
[01:40:27.073 --> 01:40:28.713]  Those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:40:28.753 --> 01:40:30.033]  Constitution are terrorists.
[01:40:30.313 --> 01:40:31.453]  They say it's a terrorist action.
[01:40:32.794 --> 01:40:34.034]  We have official training manuals.
[01:40:34.074 --> 01:40:34.954]  We have video of it.
[01:40:35.694 --> 01:40:38.255]  That's about three minutes of this 170-minute film.
[01:40:39.195 --> 01:40:41.155]  Plans to exterminate you with bioweapons.
[01:40:42.515 --> 01:40:43.356]  Mainstream news.
[01:40:43.376 --> 01:40:44.536]  That's about a minute of the film.
[01:40:45.356 --> 01:40:46.876]  The government carrying out September 11th.
[01:40:46.896 --> 01:40:48.196]  That's about 40 minutes of the film.
[01:40:48.497 --> 01:40:49.897]  The government carrying out Oklahoma City.
[01:40:49.937 --> 01:40:51.097]  That's about 40 minutes of the film.
[01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:53.151]  The history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:40:53.191 --> 01:40:54.412]  That's about 20 minutes of the film.
[01:40:54.432 --> 01:40:55.092]  It's a lead-up.
[01:40:56.813 --> 01:40:57.554]  It goes on and on.
[01:40:57.574 --> 01:41:03.117]  Their goal, their police state, their control grids, their prisons, their implantable microchips.
[01:41:03.157 --> 01:41:04.918]  I mean, that's just one of my films.
[01:41:05.779 --> 01:41:08.120]  Everybody should have Road to Tyranny.
[01:41:10.382 --> 01:41:12.423]  And now there's police state, three total enslavement.
[01:41:12.443 --> 01:41:14.284]  I mean, the thing's two hours, 40 minutes long.
[01:41:14.384 --> 01:41:18.287]  It's just Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, government-run white slavery rings.
[01:41:19.245 --> 01:41:30.231]  Implantable microchips, the concentration camps, forced inoculation, gun control, just absolute, you've got to see it, PNAC, it's all in there.
[01:41:30.872 --> 01:41:34.794]  The fake left-right paradigm, the New World Order exposed, it's just all in there.
[01:41:34.814 --> 01:41:38.276]  And then there's the books I carry, Order Out of Chaos by Paul Watson that I printed.
[01:41:38.676 --> 01:41:40.237]  My book, Ascent to Tyranny.
[01:41:40.257 --> 01:41:42.078]  Fritz Springmeier's book, Bloodlines Illuminati.
[01:41:42.951 --> 01:41:46.514]  Tex Martin has one of his best books, the latest edition of it, Circle of Intrigue.
[01:41:47.055 --> 01:41:50.798]  You need to have these books, you need to have these videos, and you need to support us.
[01:41:51.378 --> 01:42:00.706]  We've got pro-gun t-shirts that say politicians love disarmed peasants, and tyranny response team t-shirts that say InfoWars.com on the right-hand shoulder.
[01:42:01.366 --> 01:42:02.387]  Don't wait, folks.

[01:42:10.763 --> 01:42:12.764]  Some of the cheapest prices you'll find are section dollars.
[01:42:13.004 --> 01:42:13.824]  Don't wait, folks.

[01:42:45.706 --> 01:42:49.350]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:42:50.871 --> 01:42:54.434]  We found no better tools than these videos to wake people up.
[01:42:55.195 --> 01:42:56.356]  We just want to be left alone.
[01:42:56.376 --> 01:42:57.617]  We want our free country back.
[01:42:57.857 --> 01:42:59.259]  We want everybody to be able to live in peace.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.781]  We're tired of the globalists stirring up all the racial infighting and all the political correctness and all this trash.
[01:43:06.361 --> 01:43:06.801]  Stop it!
[01:43:06.921 --> 01:43:07.321]  Stop it!
[01:43:07.441 --> 01:43:07.881]  Stop it!
[01:43:08.361 --> 01:43:12.422]  Well, it's not going to stop until you stand up and let them know and dig your heels in.
[01:43:15.283 --> 01:43:15.743]  Look at this.
[01:43:15.963 --> 01:43:16.983]  Let me jump into the news now.
[01:43:17.343 --> 01:43:20.864]  Patriot Act used in 16-year-old deportation case.
[01:43:22.224 --> 01:43:22.964]  Washington Post.
[01:43:24.424 --> 01:43:25.984]  Administration receives 1987 effort.
[01:43:26.004 --> 01:43:26.145]  Revives.
[01:43:29.682 --> 01:43:31.424]  These people aren't even members of this anymore.
[01:43:31.444 --> 01:43:33.607]  The group has been listed recently as terrorists.
[01:43:33.988 --> 01:43:35.830]  They're going back and saying, we want to arrest people.
[01:43:36.772 --> 01:43:37.993]  We want to do this to people.
[01:43:39.355 --> 01:43:47.366]  From 16 years ago, 16 years ago, the Bush administration has decided to pursue a 16-year-old effort to deport two Palestinian activists
[01:43:48.177 --> 01:43:50.299]  And again, you can say, well, that's just them Palestinians.
[01:43:50.359 --> 01:43:50.939]  I don't like them.
[01:43:51.079 --> 01:43:52.020]  Well, it'll be you next.
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:54.001]  Let me tell you, all the training's for you, Christians.
[01:43:54.602 --> 01:43:55.522]  It's for you conservatives.
[01:43:55.542 --> 01:43:56.443]  It's for you gun owners.
[01:43:56.763 --> 01:43:58.144]  This is just being beta tested.
[01:43:58.164 --> 01:44:05.189]  See, it starts with the Jews in Germany, moves on to the people they want their land, and then, you know, down to the Baptists and everybody else.
[01:44:07.231 --> 01:44:10.053]  And, well, here in the new Nazi Germany, it's starting with the Arabs.
[01:44:11.894 --> 01:44:16.077]  The Bush administration has decided to pursue a 16-year-old effort to deport two Palestinian activists.
[01:44:16.610 --> 01:44:30.640]  Who has students, distributed magazines, and raised funds for a group of government now considers a terrorist organization, despite several court rulings that the deportations are unconstitutional because the men were not involved in terrorist activity and have not been members for years.
[01:44:31.521 --> 01:44:40.047]  Hey, how about we arrest Bill Clinton for pardoning and giving clemency to over 30 terrorists who carry out 130 bombings?
[01:44:40.067 --> 01:44:40.227]  Uh-huh.
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:44.600]  How about we do that?
[01:44:44.941 --> 01:44:50.983]  Oh, but Bill Clinton's protected by George Bush blocking all investigations of all of that garbage.
[01:44:51.363 --> 01:44:58.486]  I don't want to hear trashy neocons involved in theater Shakespearean show talking about how evil Clinton is.
[01:44:58.767 --> 01:45:00.347]  Bill Clinton's your buddy!
[01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:01.648]  You protect him!
[01:45:04.005 --> 01:45:08.370]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:12.976]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:45:13.116 --> 01:45:17.501]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:45:17.541 --> 01:45:18.882]  The New World Order.
[01:45:20.664 --> 01:45:24.889]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:45:24.949 --> 01:45:31.897]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:45:32.017 --> 01:45:34.040]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:44.727]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:45:45.007 --> 01:45:50.411]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:12.942]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:13.302 --> 01:48:16.805]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:48:17.246 --> 01:48:19.127]  I went down, down, down.
[01:48:19.547 --> 01:48:21.449]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[01:48:21.469 --> 01:48:23.791]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:48:25.092 --> 01:48:29.115]  Boy, there's a lot of news here that we need to go ahead and try to speed through.
[01:48:29.135 --> 01:48:29.175]  U.S.
[01:48:29.956 --> 01:48:31.718]  plans to attack seven Muslim states.
[01:48:31.758 --> 01:48:33.279]  This is out of Al Jazeera.
[01:48:34.676 --> 01:48:36.780]  We're talking about what big news this is.
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:44.392]  Leslie Clark told people in a book interview that, oh yeah, they knew about the attack on seven nations and Iraq was just the first.
[01:48:45.634 --> 01:48:48.259]  There in the Middle East, of course, Afghanistan and Central Asia.
[01:48:49.665 --> 01:48:59.127]  Presidential hopeful General Wesley Clark says the White House devised a five-year plan after the 9-11 strikes to attack seven majority Muslim countries.
[01:48:59.787 --> 01:49:15.430]  A former commander of NATO's forces in Europe, Clark claims he met with senior military officers in Washington in November 2001, who told him the Bush administration was planning to attack Iraq first before taking action against Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, Somalia, and Sudan.
[01:49:15.650 --> 01:49:17.050]  The general's allegations surfaced yesterday.
[01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:21.792]  In a new book, the Clark Critique, excerpts from which appear in the latest edition of the U.S.
[01:49:21.892 --> 01:49:23.532]  magazine, Newsweek.
[01:49:26.514 --> 01:49:31.335]  Well, folks, we have the PNAC documents where they said before 9-11 that Saddam wasn't a threat.
[01:49:31.355 --> 01:49:32.776]  He's a, quote, convenient pretext.
[01:49:32.796 --> 01:49:36.677]  We want to use that for oil and as a military base to attack these other six countries?
[01:49:36.737 --> 01:49:43.360]  I mean, and Clark's calling for new American patriotism, exactly what Bush wants, compulsory national service, worshiping the U.N.,
[01:49:44.170 --> 01:49:45.230]  I'm being good little slaves.
[01:49:45.250 --> 01:49:46.271]  And that's all that's happening now.
[01:49:46.291 --> 01:49:50.332]  The UN's going to play the part of the good cop flapping down into Iraq to save everyone.
[01:49:52.052 --> 01:49:55.713]  Privacy law in California shields drivers, New York Times, which isn't true.
[01:49:56.453 --> 01:50:02.155]  California today adopted the nation's first law meant to protect the privacy of drivers whose cars are equipped with black boxes.
[01:50:03.547 --> 01:50:03.647]  Okay.
[01:50:03.667 --> 01:50:03.807]  Okay.
[01:50:03.827 --> 01:50:03.927]  Okay.
[01:50:03.947 --> 01:50:04.027]  Okay.
[01:50:04.047 --> 01:50:04.147]  Okay.
[01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:34.124]  And again, you read the law, it's got a hole you can drive a Mack truck through it.
[01:50:35.046 --> 01:50:46.901]  But again, all the new cars have had this the last six years, and now they're getting more sophisticated, and then the media goes, oh, we're going to use this now for, we didn't think about using it to satellite track you, it's just designed to have it plugged into it.
[01:50:47.161 --> 01:50:49.064]  That's just an accident, ABC News said.
[01:50:50.197 --> 01:50:51.458]  Herald Sun in Australia.
[01:50:51.498 --> 01:50:52.498]  Spy camera test.
[01:50:52.538 --> 01:50:57.061]  High-tech spy cameras that can pinpoint criminal activity are to be tested across Victoria.
[01:50:57.501 --> 01:51:04.866]  But their ability to differentiate between lawful and unlawful behavior has been questioned by the civil libertarians who warn of Big Brother approach.
[01:51:05.326 --> 01:51:14.872]  The cameras are said to be able to identify and record everything from a drug-dealing car theft and street robberies to the length of grass in a council park.
[01:51:16.212 --> 01:51:17.013]  And it goes on and on.
[01:51:17.113 --> 01:51:18.634]  Control for face-scanning cameras.
[01:51:19.632 --> 01:51:25.013]  Also, when the British fought off ID cards from BBC, compulsory ID cards are nothing new in the UK.
[01:51:25.413 --> 01:51:28.494]  They were issued to all British civilians during World War II.
[01:51:28.774 --> 01:51:30.695]  That is until one ordinary man said no.
[01:51:30.715 --> 01:51:33.895]  That's the story of how one man said no to being a slave.
[01:51:34.355 --> 01:51:36.356]  The British wanted to keep it going, by the way, after the war.
[01:51:37.556 --> 01:51:41.017]  Clarence Wilcock, a dry cleaner from suburb North London...
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:46.381]  Must rank as one of the unlikeliest Davids ever to take on Goliath.
[01:51:46.441 --> 01:51:52.643]  Mr. Wilcock was stopped on December 7, 1950, while driving his car along Ballard's Lane.
[01:51:52.903 --> 01:51:57.265]  The uniformed police constable, Harold Muckle, who demanded to see the motorist and entity card.
[01:51:58.205 --> 01:52:01.646]  See, they don't even... That was a big deal, folks.
[01:52:02.146 --> 01:52:03.246]  And then they got that removed.
[01:52:03.346 --> 01:52:03.807]  For now.
[01:52:03.867 --> 01:52:04.647]  Now it's coming back.
[01:52:05.167 --> 01:52:06.487]  We're so enslaved, we don't even know it.
[01:52:07.128 --> 01:52:11.049]  DNA law raises privacy issues from L.J.
[01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.569]  World
[01:52:12.663 --> 01:52:14.584]  Out of Lawrence, Kansas.
[01:52:16.145 --> 01:52:25.411]  And they admit in here that they want to use all the DNA databases, but they don't tell you as every baby has blood taken from their heel and be put in a federal database.
[01:52:26.131 --> 01:52:27.913]  Of course, Bush again addressed the U.N.
[01:52:27.953 --> 01:52:30.994]  and worshipped them properly today, and so did Jacques Chirot.
[01:52:32.375 --> 01:52:37.939]  And Ashcroft's producing plea bargain discretions so you'll get prison no matter what you do so they can build more prisons.
[01:52:39.285 --> 01:52:42.066]  And terror suspect allowed to leave Germany.
[01:52:42.126 --> 01:52:43.627]  Another CIA, Al-Qaeda member.
[01:52:43.667 --> 01:52:44.367]  Got to protect them.
[01:52:44.967 --> 01:52:45.687]  Washington Post.
[01:52:46.928 --> 01:52:47.608]  We're out of time.
[01:52:47.648 --> 01:52:48.588]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:49.549]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[01:52:49.889 --> 01:52:51.849]  Have a great day, a great evening.
[01:52:54.110 --> 01:52:57.391]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:52:57.511 --> 01:53:01.753]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:53:02.013 --> 01:53:04.814]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
