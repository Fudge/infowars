[00:00:02.927 --> 00:00:06.094]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:15.314]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:17.015]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.735 --> 00:00:18.856]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:20.316]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:21.977]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.637 --> 00:00:26.258]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.492 --> 00:00:51.295]  Alright, my friends, we've got a really big show lined up for you today with just tons of in-your-face news that reveals just how serious things have gotten.
[00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:59.697]  One piece of news that I'm going to cover is a major newspaper in the state of Illinois, the anti-gun, anti-freedom state.
[00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:02.258]  That is not the people, but those that run the state.
[00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:31.578]  They now admit, from their own research, what we've known for years, the 1968 Gun Control Act is a copy of the Nazi Gun Control Act that the late Senator Dodd, when he was on the different war crimes trials, he was a prosecutor during the Nuremberg trials, he got a copy of it, he had the Library of Congress translate it, there's a record of that, and only a few words were changed.
[00:01:33.112 --> 00:01:34.113]  We're good to go.
[00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:34.413]  I think?
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.321]  We're good to go.
[00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:02.061]  I think?
[00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.592]  Media has gotten intercepts.
[00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:33.137]  The memos were out in Hawaii and California and other areas.
[00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:41.407]  The ambulance drivers have been told not to talk on their radios about SARS, so they think they found a case of it.
[00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:47.009]  They're trying to control panic, they say, while hyping it up in the media.
[00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.977]  And the Toronto Star reported Friday that the UN is, quote, using this as a power grab and creating hysteria.
[00:02:55.097 --> 00:03:04.826]  And remember that our own White House last year ordered FBI and CIA to, quote, create fear and hysteria with fake terror alerts.
[00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:06.868]  That was confirmed.
[00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:08.610]  All of them do it.
[00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.571]  Bill Clinton, George Bush, doesn't matter.
[00:03:10.951 --> 00:03:14.274]  They try to scare you and then pose as your saviors.
[00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:19.878]  Oh, they'll take good care of you if you just let them take your liberties away.
[00:03:19.978 --> 00:03:21.599]  They'll take real good care of you.
[00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.981]  It's like Ted Bundy said, just get in the Volkswagen.
[00:03:25.402 --> 00:03:27.203]  Everything's going to be all right.
[00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:40.523]  By the way, I saw this story about this psychopath who kidnapped allegedly these five women and then he would rape them for months or years and then release them and they wouldn't tell anybody.
[00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:43.824]  That's how mind-controlled they were.
[00:03:44.684 --> 00:03:46.165]  We've seen a lot of examples of this.
[00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:52.866]  And then somebody will tell me that the government can't create a mind-control slave when they admit, Senate hearings, that they did this.
[00:03:52.886 --> 00:03:57.747]  I mean, they can get you, torture you, drug you, and make you think you're a dog.
[00:03:58.695 --> 00:04:06.957]  They can make you go jump off a cliff, and they can make you go out and commit assassinations, and they've done it in almost every one of these mass shooters.
[00:04:07.237 --> 00:04:09.778]  You track it back, they lived on a military base.
[00:04:10.778 --> 00:04:17.140]  Neighbors would see vans pull up and them drag the person out, kicking and screaming when their programming would break down.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.681]  Larry Ashbrook in Fort Worth, who shot up the...
[00:04:21.798 --> 00:04:28.202]  The Baptist Church, Ash Burrow, who shot up the Jewish Center, he was under my control.
[00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:29.522]  They were both buddies, by the way.
[00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:34.725]  It's incredible, folks, but just another example of this.
[00:04:34.805 --> 00:04:39.708]  Some lone sicko can make mind control slaves, but the government can and doesn't.
[00:04:39.868 --> 00:04:40.929]  Sure they don't.
[00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:42.650]  Sure they don't.
[00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.651]  Yeah, right.
[00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:47.032]  Well, they're right back.
[00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:48.453]  Well, the government wouldn't do something like that.
[00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:49.293]  They're nice.
[00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:50.174]  They're good.
[00:04:51.105 --> 00:04:53.128]  Give up our rights and turn our guns into them?
[00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.213]  It's always a good sign when the police start wearing skull patches and black ski masks.
[00:04:58.154 --> 00:05:03.661]  I want to submit to the government, and maybe if we just totally submit to them, they'll be nice to us.
[00:05:03.861 --> 00:05:05.303]  Of course, that's never happened in history.
[00:05:05.343 --> 00:05:06.324]  It's always the opposite.
[00:05:06.544 --> 00:05:08.086]  But let's just ignore history.
[00:05:08.227 --> 00:05:09.228]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:18.324]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:22.946]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:05:23.226 --> 00:05:32.150]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.972]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:05:36.192 --> 00:05:36.993]  We're good to go.
[00:05:37.013 --> 00:05:37.234]  I think?
[00:05:50.103 --> 00:05:55.450]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.671]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[00:06:10.422 --> 00:06:17.791]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:18.072 --> 00:06:22.818]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:23.038 --> 00:06:28.685]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:33.450]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:40.817]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:40.837 --> 00:06:44.201]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:45.362]  And much, much more.
[00:06:45.542 --> 00:06:48.044]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:06:48.285 --> 00:06:55.030]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:06:55.231 --> 00:07:00.495]  Order online now at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:00.515 --> 00:07:00.916]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:09.156 --> 00:07:09.557]  We're good to go.
[00:07:24.056 --> 00:07:24.296]  The book,
[00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:55.940]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.103]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[00:08:00.224 --> 00:08:01.485]  Call the Ark Institute today.
[00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:02.145]  Toll free 1-800-255-1912.

[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.641]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.642 --> 00:08:24.543]  Well, the month of April's getting a little bit old, isn't it?
[00:08:25.263 --> 00:08:27.144]  It's already the 29th of April, 2003.
[00:08:27.264 --> 00:08:32.865]  On this live Tuesday edition of the Worldwide Broadcast, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:32.925 --> 00:08:33.685]  Thank you so much.
[00:08:34.344 --> 00:08:36.266]  We're tuning in to the show today.
[00:08:36.386 --> 00:09:00.725]  I really do appreciate all the people that care about America and have the courage and the will to face the fact that Bush is about to reinstate Clinton's assault weapons ban and wants to pass gun laws that dwarf the 1968 Gun Control Act and is opening our borders and signing on and giving all the weapons systems to Communist China and Iran while telling us we have to turn our guns in to be safe, hailing that as conservative.
[00:09:02.415 --> 00:09:05.678]  And of course the Democrats are running around engaging in their evil as usual.
[00:09:05.738 --> 00:09:06.759]  There is no difference.
[00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:11.243]  There's only a difference in rhetoric as our liberties and freedoms are destroyed.
[00:09:11.323 --> 00:09:19.290]  Dick Gephardt is calling for a takeover of your small businesses now where you'll have to pay for 40% of your employees' health care.
[00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.973]  That'll shut down about half the small businesses that I know of.
[00:09:24.655 --> 00:09:28.358]  If we didn't have fascism involved in our health care system...
[00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:45.164]  If we didn't have the private corporations working with the government to rip off the doctors and the patients and to add all these costs in and to add all this government regulation in, then we wouldn't have the high cost of health care.
[00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:48.445]  But again, the government creates the crisis and then has its solution.
[00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:50.966]  And it'll never be socialized health care, which is bad enough.
[00:09:51.366 --> 00:09:52.586]  No, it'll be something even worse.
[00:09:52.606 --> 00:09:57.528]  It'll be the HMO where they get record profits and you don't get any health care.
[00:10:00.334 --> 00:10:02.155]  Oh, welcome to the New World Order.
[00:10:02.235 --> 00:10:05.617]  See, the phony right-wingers get on the air and go, we've got to stop the liberals.
[00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:07.058]  They want to give you socialized health care.
[00:10:07.118 --> 00:10:07.979]  We need free market.
[00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:11.080]  Well, the free market they're talking about is fascist health care.
[00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:14.362]  And I'm against socialist health care, fascist health care.
[00:10:14.743 --> 00:10:17.064]  It'd be nice to have free market health care.
[00:10:18.905 --> 00:10:22.247]  But don't look for it to happen anytime soon.
[00:10:23.327 --> 00:10:29.151]  And believe me, folks, my father is a doctor and he works, he consults for some of the
[00:10:29.847 --> 00:10:30.527]  We're good to go.
[00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:56.081]  They sign deals with hospitals, the insurance companies do, to not really give people care.
[00:10:56.261 --> 00:10:57.801]  They give them the cheapest care.
[00:10:57.941 --> 00:10:59.202]  It doesn't matter what they need.
[00:10:59.222 --> 00:10:59.862]  They don't get it.
[00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:05.643]  And then they gouge you with ridiculous prices for the substandard care that you do get.
[00:11:06.664 --> 00:11:18.127]  And my father's found that over time, that makes health care systems break down and that short-term it's profitable, long-term it's not profitable for the hospitals and other types of medical chains
[00:11:19.128 --> 00:11:22.850]  But it's always popular for the insurance companies.
[00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:35.556]  My dad goes out and tries to teach folks how to not do that with the insurance companies and how to team up the different medical companies to team up and not go along with what the insurance companies offer and try to push on them.
[00:11:37.377 --> 00:11:39.138]  Disgusting insurance companies.
[00:11:39.478 --> 00:11:42.019]  They are not free market, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:44.561 --> 00:11:46.001]  See, that's where the liberals get it wrong.
[00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:46.982]  They think that
[00:11:47.814 --> 00:11:53.618]  You stop the corrupt corporations by creating big government and that that will stop the big corporations.
[00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:57.021]  Well, no, that empowers the corrupt corporations.
[00:11:57.101 --> 00:12:07.368]  They use government and government law enforcement and government regulation to go after their competition and to institutionalize profits for themselves that were not derived of the free market.
[00:12:07.408 --> 00:12:10.390]  It's called crony capitalism, but this is much worse.
[00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.773]  It's a form of hyper-criminal crony capitalism.
[00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:21.351]  And then you have some of the right-wingers who aren't really right-wingers.
[00:12:21.391 --> 00:12:26.318]  They are the most ultra-communist you've ever seen in your life, to use the popular political paradigm.
[00:12:26.338 --> 00:12:29.604]  That's not accurate, but we'll use terms in the language that's understood here.
[00:12:30.445 --> 00:12:38.948]  Ultra-communist, ultra-big government, ultra-evil, no freedom, grab your guns, but they run around yelling, I'm a conservative, stop the liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:42.689]  You know, it's like a crook who dresses up in a cop's uniform to rob the bank.
[00:12:42.989 --> 00:12:44.229]  I mean, can we figure this out?
[00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:47.330]  The crook's dressed up in a cop's uniform as conservatives.
[00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.271]  They're not good conservatives.
[00:12:49.291 --> 00:12:50.571]  They're not a good police officer.
[00:12:50.591 --> 00:12:51.631]  They're not a good conservative.
[00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:56.953]  They're evil, wicked bank robbers, and they're robbing you right now, laughing at you.
[00:12:59.299 --> 00:13:00.099]  Oh, it's so sick.
[00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.880]  You understand the analogy here of what the neocons are?
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.622]  The most vicious, big government criminals you can imagine.
[00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:08.902]  Look at what they're actually doing.
[00:13:10.443 --> 00:13:11.643]  Savaging America.
[00:13:11.663 --> 00:13:13.044]  All right, I'm not going to get off into that again.
[00:13:13.064 --> 00:13:14.544]  If you can't figure it out, you're in deep trouble.
[00:13:15.665 --> 00:13:16.805]  I mean, just look at this article.
[00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:18.186]  I've got information overload.
[00:13:18.246 --> 00:13:23.267]  My wife, my webmaster, she printed off about 100 articles.
[00:13:23.307 --> 00:13:24.128]  I'm not exaggerating.
[00:13:24.468 --> 00:13:25.168]  100 articles at least.
[00:13:25.588 --> 00:13:27.789]  I printed about 30 this morning surfing around.
[00:13:28.968 --> 00:13:30.410]  I'm looking at giant stacks of them.
[00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.731]  Here is just one of them.
[00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:32.792]  They're all horrible.
[00:13:34.034 --> 00:13:46.888]  We've got the national parks, by the way, as I told you in 97, in America Destroyed by Design, my first film, planned to shut down the parks to car access and to shut down most of the camping sites and to shut off areas where you can't even walk, period.
[00:13:47.328 --> 00:13:49.851]  Well, it's now official and now happening en masse.
[00:13:50.808 --> 00:13:52.029]  I just read the executive order.
[00:13:52.929 --> 00:13:55.771]  I just, you know, I snuck in behind closed doors.
[00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:56.671]  Well, you know, walked in.
[00:13:56.731 --> 00:13:57.932]  Wasn't actually sneaking, I guess.
[00:13:58.372 --> 00:14:06.657]  But the point is, just walked into the offices and saw the big maps and sent the film of what they had shut down, what they planned to shut down in four phases.
[00:14:06.757 --> 00:14:08.098]  Well, we're now entering phase three.
[00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:10.139]  I got that here.
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:20.085]  I've got them arresting sheep herders for no reason on their, quote, private land because they didn't graze them right or they shot a cougar who was attacking their livestock.
[00:14:21.408 --> 00:14:24.230]  Now these cougars are eating kids and they're at massive levels.
[00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:27.793]  Alligators are coming out and eating people's dogs in Florida.
[00:14:28.674 --> 00:14:29.715]  Record numbers of them.
[00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:30.716]  But all can't hunt them.
[00:14:31.937 --> 00:14:34.939]  Inside Cisco's eavesdropping apparatus.
[00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:36.180]  You know who Cisco is?
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.443]  The big networking computer system.
[00:14:40.503 --> 00:14:46.168]  Cisco Systems has created a more efficient and targeted way for police and intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on people.
[00:14:46.488 --> 00:14:49.110]  This internet service provider uses their company's routers.
[00:14:51.081 --> 00:14:51.901]  And what does this do?
[00:14:52.702 --> 00:15:09.569]  Well, I mean, I remember in 95, they signed a deal with the telecommunications industry, paid them $8 billion, supposed to be $5 billion, but it ended up being $8 billion, to put giant snooping hubs in every backbone of every satellite, in every landline, giant integrated hubs.
[00:15:09.669 --> 00:15:13.691]  When you hear a click, folks, that's because there was a power surge somewhere.
[00:15:13.771 --> 00:15:14.972]  It's not the government listening.
[00:15:16.092 --> 00:15:17.733]  Okay, you don't hear clicks.
[00:15:17.793 --> 00:15:20.534]  That was 30 years ago, if the feds were doing it.
[00:15:21.869 --> 00:15:26.130]  Ten years ago, the local cops were doing it, or had it down the road in the phone box.
[00:15:27.971 --> 00:15:34.833]  Echelon's been hooked into everything for years, and they had total control by the late 90s.
[00:15:35.973 --> 00:15:38.454]  And here's Declan McCullough for CNET News.
[00:15:38.494 --> 00:15:40.274]  He also writes for Washington Post, a bunch of other folks.
[00:15:40.474 --> 00:15:42.195]  They like to let you know what they're doing to you, I guess, now.
[00:15:43.684 --> 00:15:50.069]  A company recently published a proposal that describes how it plans to embed lawful encryption capability into its products.
[00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:53.512]  Among the highlights, eavesdropping must be undetectable.
[00:15:53.632 --> 00:16:00.077]  A multitude of police agencies concluded simultaneous wiretaps must not learn of one another.
[00:16:00.397 --> 00:16:05.521]  The Internet provider uses encryption to preserve its customers' privacy and has access to encryption keys.
[00:16:05.561 --> 00:16:09.544]  It must turn over the encrypted communication to police in a descrambled form.
[00:16:11.718 --> 00:16:13.559]  So you see what's going on there.
[00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:14.979]  It's a total joke.
[00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:17.240]  We'll come out and advertise.
[00:16:18.121 --> 00:16:22.262]  Sign up with Cisco Systems or put in our system or go with this internet provider.
[00:16:22.683 --> 00:16:24.744]  They give you encryption protection.
[00:16:24.764 --> 00:16:27.605]  Oh, yeah, with the keys to the government.
[00:16:27.645 --> 00:16:28.285]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:16:28.305 --> 00:16:32.947]  It's like, we put a lock on your front door for you, but we gave the keys to the man in the black ski mask.
[00:16:34.608 --> 00:16:36.048]  That's why I never plug this.
[00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:38.569]  We have rovanetpowersinfowars.net.
[00:16:38.609 --> 00:16:40.030]  It's a clone, same service.
[00:16:41.777 --> 00:16:45.378]  1-800-SERVICE, 24-hour tech support, all that stuff.
[00:16:46.178 --> 00:16:47.839]  It's got a virtual browser.
[00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:55.240]  That way, you're through a whole other system, a whole other server, blocks cookies, blocks spam, blocks the feds.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:07.283]  It's the only way, and frankly, they can get through that too, but it takes a lot of computer processing time and more energy, and it's harder for them, and it cuts out most of the people spying on you.
[00:17:08.044 --> 00:17:11.205]  So you need to go sign up at InfoWars.net for internet service.
[00:17:13.625 --> 00:17:16.946]  And that helps support us with our gigantic bandwidth cost.
[00:17:17.046 --> 00:17:18.246]  It's just amazing, folks.
[00:17:18.707 --> 00:17:21.387]  Every six months, we are now... No, it's every eight months.
[00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:26.068]  We're doubling the number of hits we get to InfoWars.com.
[00:17:26.528 --> 00:17:29.309]  PrisonPlanet.com is about, what, six, seven months old?
[00:17:30.529 --> 00:17:34.750]  It's already doing what InfoWars was doing in hits about a year ago.
[00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.371]  And it's exploding.
[00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:41.313]  And you might go sign up at InfoWars.net.
[00:17:41.533 --> 00:17:42.854]  Just go read all those services.
[00:17:42.894 --> 00:17:43.654]  Just go look at it.
[00:17:43.694 --> 00:17:45.415]  Or go sign up at Rovan.net.
[00:17:45.555 --> 00:17:46.356]  I don't care.
[00:17:47.036 --> 00:17:48.397]  Just go do it.
[00:17:49.197 --> 00:17:50.538]  It costs less.
[00:17:51.018 --> 00:17:57.522]  It's an actual high-speed dial-up, which means, all that means when you hear those ads on TV is, you're not sharing phone lines.
[00:17:58.703 --> 00:17:59.043]  You see?
[00:17:59.063 --> 00:18:02.485]  They don't even give you phone line strength with AOL and the rest of them.
[00:18:03.214 --> 00:18:03.775]  We're good to go.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:23.801]  A phone line.
[00:18:24.902 --> 00:18:26.003]  The whole phone line.
[00:18:26.023 --> 00:18:28.425]  That's what he goes out and gets, phone numbers for the whole country.
[00:18:28.745 --> 00:18:30.466]  And then they have other faster services if you want it.
[00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:31.787]  I didn't mean to get off on that.
[00:18:31.828 --> 00:18:37.452]  It's just that when these companies advertise encryption and all this, if it's the new encryption, give me a break.
[00:18:37.472 --> 00:18:38.613]  They have keys to all of it.
[00:18:38.974 --> 00:18:44.919]  And all any encryption really does is slow down the computers and the processing power of Echelon and others.
[00:18:46.562 --> 00:18:49.187]  Of course, frankly, I don't, you know, the globalists are reading what I'm doing.
[00:18:49.288 --> 00:18:51.071]  People say, well, who cares if I'm being spied on?
[00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:53.175]  What's the point if you're living in a police state, folks?
[00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:54.538]  I mean, I don't have anything to hide.
[00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:57.195]  I hope they read about how we're losing our freedoms.
[00:18:57.235 --> 00:19:01.696]  I hope they do grab that email and read what the Patriot Act does and go look at the bill.
[00:19:02.696 --> 00:19:04.597]  Whatever little poor analyst they've got reading it.
[00:19:05.157 --> 00:19:06.878]  But then that really gets down to the bottom line.
[00:19:07.158 --> 00:19:18.101]  They could have 10 million analysts and if they were just listening to what the keyword software picked up, it'd still be like coming home for each analyst and finding 5,000, 10,000 phone messages to listen to.
[00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:24.043]  And even if you could listen to all of them every day, imagine trying to go and track down and file it and do something with it
[00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:30.100]  So when they announce echelon and eavesdropping and they're spying on you, most of that is to create fear.
[00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:32.482]  Most of that is to be a chilling effect, okay?
[00:19:33.063 --> 00:19:35.584]  Yes, do they listen to Alex Jones routinely?
[00:19:35.604 --> 00:19:37.526]  I'm sure I've got analysts that check in on me.
[00:19:38.487 --> 00:19:42.150]  But they've got to have a real sicko to do it or they wake up and join us.
[00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.611]  So that's another problem the globalists face.
[00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:49.595]  Their personnel are joining our ranks in masses because they find out it's all true.
[00:19:49.835 --> 00:19:51.637]  So welcome to the team, boys and girls!
[00:19:53.001 --> 00:19:54.562]  If you love your children, join us.
[00:19:54.582 --> 00:19:58.065]  If you love evil and weakness, join the New World Order.
[00:19:58.645 --> 00:20:00.987]  So stop worrying, speak out, stand strong.
[00:20:01.287 --> 00:20:04.790]  The globalists, the Nazis can only win if you cower in fear.
[00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.413]  Masses of news, your calls, it's all coming up.
[00:20:08.433 --> 00:20:08.873]  Stay with me.
[00:20:10.825 --> 00:20:14.287]  What if you could actually save money on everything you ever needed to buy?

[00:21:10.502 --> 00:21:14.404]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:20.068]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:21:20.348 --> 00:21:30.714]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:35.217]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:35.417 --> 00:21:39.019]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine
[00:21:39.019 --> 00:21:39.920]  We're good to go.
[00:22:09.019 --> 00:22:10.220]  We're good to go.

[00:22:34.676 --> 00:22:36.638]  The benefits of organic gardening are endless.
[00:22:36.878 --> 00:22:39.581]  You'll even be saving money with Arbico's guaranteed low prices.
[00:22:39.741 --> 00:22:42.464]  Call them now at 1-800-827-2847 and receive free ladybugs with any beneficial insect order.
[00:22:46.028 --> 00:22:46.648]  We're good to go.
[00:22:46.668 --> 00:22:47.269]  We're good to go.
[00:23:09.902 --> 00:23:14.165]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:23:14.606 --> 00:23:19.149]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:23:19.529 --> 00:23:24.453]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:23:24.773 --> 00:23:26.554]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:27.615]  can barely be read.
[00:23:27.635 --> 00:23:28.876]  It has faded that much.
[00:23:29.236 --> 00:23:33.139]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[00:23:33.399 --> 00:23:41.765]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.
[00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:49.911]  But you don't just get the Declaration, which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95, shipping included.
[00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:54.154]  And as a special gift for ordering now, you will also receive a commemorative U.S.
[00:23:54.194 --> 00:23:56.436]  Constitution proof silver dollar with your order.
[00:23:56.756 --> 00:24:02.002]  Call now toll-free 800-686-2237 and order the documents of freedom.
[00:24:02.282 --> 00:24:02.802]  Don't wait.
[00:24:03.083 --> 00:24:03.703]  Do it today.
[00:24:04.064 --> 00:24:04.564]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:24:13.328 --> 00:24:13.828]  Don't worry.
[00:24:14.309 --> 00:24:15.829]  This show is documented.
[00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.171]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:19.511 --> 00:24:23.053]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:24:23.073 --> 00:24:27.555]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:24:28.095 --> 00:24:30.036]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:24:31.017 --> 00:24:32.357]  The ring of fire.
[00:24:33.298 --> 00:24:34.118]  The ring of fire.
[00:24:34.178 --> 00:24:36.059]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:39.421]  Again, thank you for joining me here on the show today.
[00:24:40.081 --> 00:24:42.002]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:42.022 --> 00:24:44.103]  And I'm also going to get into profile of a kidnapper.
[00:24:44.543 --> 00:24:46.224]  It's all about control.
[00:24:46.805 --> 00:24:47.985]  Absolute domination.
[00:24:48.385 --> 00:24:53.168]  It explains why Gomeski's alleged victim wouldn't flee.
[00:24:54.829 --> 00:24:57.230]  Now, again, this is an example of mind control.
[00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:03.593]  The government with drugs and torture can make you a total mind control slave.
[00:25:04.374 --> 00:25:06.275]  They've always found it's easier to do to women.
[00:25:07.115 --> 00:25:08.856]  But you can do it with basically any man.
[00:25:09.696 --> 00:25:12.999]  Just mince the programming according to the congressional reports.
[00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:13.980]  This is an admitted fact.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.782]  Tend to break down a little bit quicker.
[00:25:15.802 --> 00:25:21.767]  You know, lose the programming and not follow orders.
[00:25:23.048 --> 00:25:25.090]  And it's kind of like that in the mass mind control.
[00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:31.236]  Women, they found, well, Hitler said, first you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[00:25:31.256 --> 00:25:34.379]  Not that women are dumb, just women are the center of society.
[00:25:35.214 --> 00:25:38.256]  And you target them, and you've got the children, so follow the men.
[00:25:38.316 --> 00:25:42.218]  Men do what women want, what they think women think is cool.
[00:25:42.638 --> 00:25:47.240]  They follow the leader, so they get women to be anti-gun, anti-family, anti-America.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.341]  Well, then the men turn into that.
[00:25:50.582 --> 00:26:00.767]  You train women to accept men being beer-bellied creatures, watching nothing but football, caring less about their children, being lazy, and then the women accept that, and the society's over.
[00:26:02.435 --> 00:26:11.518]  So we'll get into allegedly five women kidnapped, held, and he took photos and all this stuff of it, and then he could just let them go.
[00:26:11.578 --> 00:26:12.738]  They never tell years later.
[00:26:13.419 --> 00:26:14.859]  That's mind control.
[00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:18.901]  That's what Harris and Kleibold and others from the evidence were clearly under.
[00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:22.962]  You've heard Furrow, Ashbrook, Sirhan Sirhan.
[00:26:24.183 --> 00:26:30.245]  Hinkley, the list goes on and on, and we're going to talk a little bit about that here on the show today.
[00:26:30.805 --> 00:26:44.010]  Some of the other news I have is it's now coming out that, again, the latest five reports of finding chemical weapons in Iraq were rocket fuel for legal, lawful rockets, even under U.N.
[00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:47.351]  control, and more bug spray that they found.
[00:26:47.371 --> 00:26:48.912]  Oh, surprise, surprise!
[00:26:49.492 --> 00:26:50.012]  We're good to go.
[00:27:09.678 --> 00:27:11.400]  54 times that I've counted up.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.322]  54 times they found stuff that wasn't real.
[00:27:13.682 --> 00:27:16.745]  Oh, but on the 60th time or whatever they choose, it's coming soon.
[00:27:16.785 --> 00:27:17.285]  Don't worry.
[00:27:17.866 --> 00:27:18.847]  Oh, we really found it.
[00:27:18.967 --> 00:27:19.487]  It's real.
[00:27:19.507 --> 00:27:20.348]  And we'll go, see?
[00:27:20.808 --> 00:27:21.489]  They were right.
[00:27:21.889 --> 00:27:22.570]  Vindicated.
[00:27:24.429 --> 00:27:31.254]  And they'll probably plant something, only because, they'll probably plant Russian nerve gas or something, because they're clearly finding U.S.
[00:27:31.274 --> 00:27:31.915]  chemical weapons.
[00:27:31.935 --> 00:27:33.616]  They did in the first Gulf War, that's admitted.
[00:27:34.017 --> 00:27:35.378]  There's huge storehouses of U.S.
[00:27:35.418 --> 00:27:38.800]  made chemical weapons, but they can't have the find B chemical weapons.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.603]  I'm sure the Marines are just stumbling over it everywhere like last time.
[00:27:43.064 --> 00:27:45.085]  There's no way to destroy all those bunkers of it.
[00:27:45.345 --> 00:27:46.646]  Saddam didn't have the time or money.
[00:27:47.007 --> 00:27:50.489]  Our own government can't get rid of all the bunkers they've got out west for all this stuff.
[00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.371]  Even at the Anniston Depot.
[00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:56.411]  In Alabama, they can't burn all of it.
[00:27:56.431 --> 00:27:59.932]  Yeah, they burn it and shoot it out the top of the chimney, the nerve gas.
[00:27:59.972 --> 00:28:03.453]  Oh, by the way, there was an earthquake, a pretty good one, too.
[00:28:03.714 --> 00:28:04.254]  Not too bad.
[00:28:04.274 --> 00:28:07.375]  Didn't shake a whole stuff there in Alabama today.
[00:28:07.415 --> 00:28:08.815]  That's on Infowars.com.
[00:28:10.476 --> 00:28:12.076]  So that's the kind of stuff we got here.
[00:28:12.136 --> 00:28:13.577]  Just lots of news like that.
[00:28:15.823 --> 00:28:19.345]  I'm sure they're stumbling over chemical weapons, but it's all Mark U.S.
[00:28:19.385 --> 00:28:20.106]  like last time.
[00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:24.749]  So there'll be a nice little flag in the Russian made, dropped off at the key point.
[00:28:24.849 --> 00:28:26.070]  Oh, look, he did have it.
[00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:26.470]  See?
[00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:29.092]  They'll fill up some jar with it.
[00:28:29.252 --> 00:28:30.253]  Oh, look, he had it.
[00:28:30.913 --> 00:28:32.174]  I mean, that's coming any day.
[00:28:32.214 --> 00:28:32.595]  Don't worry.
[00:28:32.615 --> 00:28:36.958]  And then the crowing by the talk show host of, oh, look at Vindicates.
[00:28:37.878 --> 00:28:38.859]  See, it's psychology.
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:43.022]  They get caught in the wrong all these times, making it look like they're legitimate.
[00:28:43.102 --> 00:28:44.082]  Oh, we checked it's wrong.
[00:28:44.142 --> 00:28:44.863]  Oh, we checked it's wrong.
[00:28:44.883 --> 00:28:49.785]  And then finally the world will buy it when they find it and it's real because, oh, look, all the times they were wrong.
[00:28:50.385 --> 00:28:51.406]  Oh, and you're doubting me?
[00:28:51.486 --> 00:29:03.412]  Folks, they claimed that big African country, Niger, sold nuclear weapons parts, totally controlled, and uranium and other goodies to Saddam, created a false report.
[00:29:04.278 --> 00:29:08.260]  The document, supposedly the bill of sale, totally fake, made by the U.S.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:08.580]  government.
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:09.320]  Not the U.S.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.781]  government, but the globalists, the parasite that controls the government.
[00:29:13.161 --> 00:29:17.103]  Ever seen a science fiction movie with a little alien crawls in your ear and gets control of your brain?
[00:29:17.123 --> 00:29:18.463]  That's what the New World Order did.
[00:29:18.503 --> 00:29:23.465]  And then they sit up there and wave flags at us and say, oh, this is America, go along with us.
[00:29:23.505 --> 00:29:28.127]  It's like the bank robber again in the cop uniform coming in dressed like a cop to get control.
[00:29:28.926 --> 00:29:32.570]  It's a body snatcher type deal to use the analogy, a they live analogy.
[00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:34.592]  It looks like one thing, it's another.
[00:29:34.612 --> 00:29:41.478]  So when you stick that American flag on your car now, it means you support everything that destroys what the flag symbolizes.
[00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:46.143]  See, we used to put flags all on our cars and houses because we were right-wing patriots.
[00:29:47.268 --> 00:29:48.249]  And then we were bad.
[00:29:48.289 --> 00:29:50.390]  The police manual said, watch somebody.
[00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.113]  This is actually the manuals with a bunch of American flags on their car in the late 90s.
[00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:57.635]  But now, watch them if they don't have American flags.
[00:29:57.655 --> 00:29:58.596]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.677 --> 00:30:01.578]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.078 --> 00:30:03.679]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.282]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:37.811]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:38.492 --> 00:30:40.855]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:30:40.875 --> 00:30:44.059]  All right, my friends.
[00:30:52.071 --> 00:30:53.152]  Mind Control Mind Control
[00:31:19.392 --> 00:31:25.357]  You know, George Bush, there's this headline, George Bush thought Saddam was behind 9-1-1 all along.
[00:31:26.998 --> 00:31:38.868]  That's like saying Charlie Manson thought Tex Watson was behind killing Sharon Tate all along when he heroically stopped Tex Watson from cutting her stomach open.
[00:31:40.289 --> 00:31:44.032]  You know, Tex Watson and others involved in the ritual killings
[00:31:45.414 --> 00:31:46.755]  Are you getting what I'm saying?
[00:31:47.076 --> 00:31:55.565]  It's like Charlie Manson saying, I thought Tex Watson was involved in the killing of Sharon Tate all along.
[00:31:57.185 --> 00:31:58.866]  I mean, this is getting too rich here.
[00:31:59.266 --> 00:32:15.190]  Folks, if anyone just investigates 9-1-1, in the slightest fashion, you find total lies, total corruption, total prior knowledge, and then you find funding of all the hijackers and their homes and cars paid for, FBI agents living with them, colonels going public.
[00:32:15.211 --> 00:32:16.811]  They were forced to train these people.
[00:32:17.091 --> 00:32:19.292]  Then you find out most of them are still alive.
[00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:23.213]  Then you find out the CIA was, quote, running a drill of flying hijacked planes into buildings.
[00:32:25.672 --> 00:32:36.636]  It's like Jeffrey Dahmer is very concerned about cannibalism and thought that John Wayne Gacy was involved in it all along.
[00:32:38.657 --> 00:32:42.418]  So, we'll get into the 911 whitewash that's going on in this new whitewash committee.
[00:32:43.719 --> 00:32:45.339]  The Post-Standard's got an article here.
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.980]  Profile of a kidnapper.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.721]  It's all about control.
[00:32:49.381 --> 00:32:50.822]  Absolute domination.
[00:32:50.842 --> 00:32:51.762]  It explains why...
[00:32:52.583 --> 00:32:55.305]  Jemelski's alleged victims wouldn't flee.
[00:32:56.686 --> 00:33:05.173]  The last teenager, John Jemelski, allegedly held captive, seemed to have had a few opportunities to flee, but didn't take them.
[00:33:06.694 --> 00:33:13.139]  It may be hard to fathom, experts say, but it shows the level of control kidnappers can have over their victims.
[00:33:14.199 --> 00:33:15.580]  Not back in the 50s, folks.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.762]  We were a lot simpler and more decent, but people would flee, they would fight back.
[00:33:20.142 --> 00:33:23.144]  Somebody pulled a knife or a gun in a crowd, everybody would jump them.
[00:33:23.944 --> 00:33:27.747]  In the new America, most of the time, people fall down gravel, men begin to beg.
[00:33:27.767 --> 00:33:36.371]  We're a cowardly lot, by and large, unless the global leader says, attack someone, and then we'll viciously do it all day and have lots of courage.
[00:33:37.172 --> 00:33:38.953]  But only if the government says it's okay.
[00:33:39.333 --> 00:33:41.054]  We turn into jelly in our moods
[00:33:41.867 --> 00:33:47.210]  If not, that's why Bush is against arming the pilots and tried to block Barbara Boxer, the conservative, from arming all the pilots.
[00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:48.371]  Yeah, she's more conservative than him.
[00:33:48.731 --> 00:33:49.311]  That's what happened.
[00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:50.832]  I mean, let's just use their paradigm.
[00:33:51.552 --> 00:33:55.615]  And she doesn't want the message of you arming and protecting yourselves.
[00:33:55.895 --> 00:33:59.377]  That's why they arrest kids that play dodgeball or musical chairs now.
[00:33:59.437 --> 00:34:00.557]  They arrest them in school.
[00:34:00.597 --> 00:34:02.018]  It's a violent thing they did.
[00:34:02.579 --> 00:34:04.039]  Zero tolerance.
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:10.403]  Cringing us how to be little mindless gerbils in the cage for the boa constructor to have a meal.
[00:34:11.437 --> 00:34:12.978]  Profile of a kidnapper.
[00:34:13.439 --> 00:34:14.580]  It's all about control.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.904]  Absolute domination explains why Domeski's alleged victims wouldn't flee.
[00:34:19.704 --> 00:34:24.809]  It may be hard to fathom, experts say, but it shows the level of control kidnappers can have over their victims.
[00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:27.511]  This is all about fear, it said.
[00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:31.795]  Pat Brown, director of the Sexual Homicide Exchange and Criminal Profiler.
[00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:35.579]  Terrorizing the heck out of you for a period of time threatens...
[00:34:36.309 --> 00:34:45.914]  That he will hurt you or hurt someone you love, that if you do anything to displease him, you'll pay for it, you end up living in absolute paranoia.
[00:34:47.475 --> 00:34:53.578]  It's natural to question why at least one of John Jelmeski's alleged victims didn't bolt when she had the chance.
[00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:58.381]  Brown said, but the dynamics of such cases are not so simple.
[00:34:59.641 --> 00:35:04.204]  Jelmeski, 67, is suspected by authorities of kidnapping at least four victims, 165 missing.
[00:35:06.051 --> 00:35:15.455]  In keeping them captive in an underground bunker at his DeWitt home, although he has been charged only in the most recent case involving a 16-year-old girl, the case has not yet gone to trial.
[00:35:15.535 --> 00:35:17.415]  I hope they fry that piece of filth.
[00:35:17.976 --> 00:35:32.601]  Experts interviewed for the story spoke in general terms about similar cases and in some instances commented on specific allegations against Jelmeski, but they have no knowledge of whether Jelmeski committed the crimes of which he is accused.
[00:35:32.641 --> 00:35:34.302]  Only so they got all this evidence now inside there.
[00:35:36.395 --> 00:35:50.706]  And it goes on to say in the weeks before his arrest, Gomeski had started talking to a 16-year-old girl out on errands and to social settings such as karaoke bar, and according to comments he made to police that were confirmed by several witnesses.
[00:35:52.368 --> 00:35:54.129]  And let me explain something here.
[00:35:55.538 --> 00:35:57.739]  What do you think the government's doing on a mass scale?
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.281]  Smallpox, anthrax, SARS.
[00:36:00.581 --> 00:36:01.642]  We may have to quarantine.
[00:36:01.682 --> 00:36:02.442]  Take your rights.
[00:36:02.482 --> 00:36:03.523]  We'll take care of you.
[00:36:03.883 --> 00:36:05.464]  Secret arrest for any reason.
[00:36:05.864 --> 00:36:07.165]  Al-Qaeda's going to get you.
[00:36:07.225 --> 00:36:08.346]  They can nerve gas us.
[00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:09.767]  They can nuke us any minute.
[00:36:09.987 --> 00:36:10.767]  But don't worry.
[00:36:11.007 --> 00:36:12.468]  The government will keep you safe.
[00:36:12.728 --> 00:36:13.669]  Just stay with us.
[00:36:14.389 --> 00:36:16.831]  Just do what we say and everything will be all right.
[00:36:17.551 --> 00:36:18.252]  This is torture.
[00:36:18.292 --> 00:36:19.272]  This is mind control.
[00:36:19.312 --> 00:36:21.574]  This is trauma-based mind control, people.
[00:36:24.108 --> 00:36:25.629]  Now, let's talk about MKUltra.
[00:36:25.729 --> 00:36:26.129]  Admitted.
[00:36:26.149 --> 00:36:26.129]  77.
[00:36:26.169 --> 00:36:28.890]  79.
[00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:28.890]  Senate hearings.
[00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:29.550]  Kidnapping.
[00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:30.071]  Torture.
[00:36:31.511 --> 00:36:32.492]  Theodore Kaczynski.
[00:36:32.712 --> 00:36:33.472]  LA Times.
[00:36:33.532 --> 00:36:36.193]  The Unabomber.
[00:36:36.213 --> 00:36:36.233]  1958-62.
[00:36:36.333 --> 00:36:38.234]  CIA mind control subject.
[00:36:38.874 --> 00:36:40.615]  Admitted.
[00:36:40.635 --> 00:36:43.596]  Harvard admits it.
[00:36:44.216 --> 00:36:47.498]  And the guy shows up blowing stuff up.
[00:36:47.918 --> 00:36:48.638]  35 years later.
[00:36:49.159 --> 00:36:50.079]  Are you stupid?
[00:36:51.264 --> 00:36:54.366]  Out there, ladies and gentlemen, are you dumb?
[00:36:54.486 --> 00:36:56.428]  Can you see what's going on here?
[00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:02.332]  The guy, and I have the article in the Takeover, you know, the L.A.
[00:37:02.352 --> 00:37:05.915]  Times article, talking about Theodore Kaczynski in the L.A.
[00:37:05.955 --> 00:37:06.215]  Times.
[00:37:06.495 --> 00:37:07.916]  I mean, they admit he's mind control.
[00:37:07.956 --> 00:37:09.197]  He's off bombing things.
[00:37:09.893 --> 00:37:10.373]  What do they do?
[00:37:10.413 --> 00:37:11.874]  They get more control out of the bombing.
[00:37:12.434 --> 00:37:13.534]  Let me just slap the microphone.
[00:37:13.554 --> 00:37:14.295]  Maybe this will wake you up.
[00:37:14.675 --> 00:37:15.775]  Do you hear me?
[00:37:16.296 --> 00:37:17.256]  Do you hear me out there?
[00:37:17.276 --> 00:37:18.396]  This is real, folks.
[00:37:19.077 --> 00:37:19.457]  Wait a minute.
[00:37:19.477 --> 00:37:23.918]  You go from this kidnapper, this alleged kidnapper, and these women who wouldn't escape or wouldn't speak out.
[00:37:24.819 --> 00:37:28.680]  You go from that to CIA mind control.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.000]  Yeah.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.641]  I'm not saying this is mind control.
[00:37:30.961 --> 00:37:33.142]  That is CIA mind control, but it is mind control.
[00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:34.826]  We're good to go.
[00:37:34.846 --> 00:37:35.407]  I think?
[00:37:56.852 --> 00:37:57.773]  I'll do it, yes sir.
[00:37:57.933 --> 00:37:59.674]  They would get them to sign the forms.
[00:37:59.714 --> 00:38:03.116]  Incredible, patriotic, red, white, and blue heroes.
[00:38:03.636 --> 00:38:04.417]  They'd sign that.
[00:38:04.817 --> 00:38:05.998]  They'd go, just a shot, sir.
[00:38:06.578 --> 00:38:13.503]  And then they would torture the living daylights out of these men, men like Kaczynski and others, and have mind control slaves.
[00:38:13.983 --> 00:38:14.483]  They'd torture.
[00:38:14.523 --> 00:38:15.624]  These guys would disappear.
[00:38:15.964 --> 00:38:18.526]  Families testified for years.
[00:38:19.213 --> 00:38:25.442]  Reservice, believing they were a new person, totally new, jovial attitude, whereas before they were quiet and serious.
[00:38:26.023 --> 00:38:29.688]  They had to disappear from time to time on little missions, assassinations.
[00:38:30.489 --> 00:38:34.996]  And they have a whole core of these people, of men.
[00:38:37.133 --> 00:38:38.014]  We're good to go.
[00:38:58.271 --> 00:38:59.831]  Neighbors saw vans pull up.
[00:38:59.871 --> 00:39:00.672]  They would grab him.
[00:39:00.712 --> 00:39:01.412]  He was freaking out.
[00:39:01.432 --> 00:39:02.672]  He was busting his house up.
[00:39:02.712 --> 00:39:03.672]  He was calling the paper.
[00:39:03.892 --> 00:39:04.953]  They're telling me to kill.
[00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:05.713]  I don't want to do it.
[00:39:05.733 --> 00:39:06.973]  It was my control in the Navy.
[00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:07.413]  Help me.
[00:39:07.433 --> 00:39:08.914]  They're giving me the access codes.
[00:39:09.014 --> 00:39:09.734]  I don't want to do it.
[00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.214]  His programming wore out.
[00:39:11.294 --> 00:39:14.215]  They had him go into a Baptist church and shoot everybody.
[00:39:14.715 --> 00:39:17.736]  And then he sat down, stuck the gun in his mouth, blew his hat off.
[00:39:18.096 --> 00:39:24.337]  That's the disposal training, which they admit they did to these people.
[00:39:25.078 --> 00:39:26.498]  They're always former military.
[00:39:28.107 --> 00:39:30.328]  Farrow was in the Army, not in the Air Force, but he lived at the Air Force Base.
[00:39:30.348 --> 00:39:32.750]  The point is, he's like a 45-year-old man living at the Air Force Base.
[00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.991]  Same thing with Ashbrook.
[00:39:34.011 --> 00:39:34.792]  He was in the Navy.
[00:39:35.852 --> 00:39:37.614]  Decades later, he's running around doing this.
[00:39:38.995 --> 00:39:39.896]  They talked to his family.
[00:39:39.916 --> 00:39:43.538]  He was fine, quote, until he got out of the Navy and was crazy ever after.
[00:39:43.558 --> 00:39:44.679]  You know?
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:56.088]  So, you're like, there's no way the government can mind-control somebody, but this degenerate sack of pus, this...
[00:39:56.992 --> 00:40:08.075]  Guy, and they've been in the house now with all the stuff, he's over here with all these women, this alleged kidnapper, and he releases the women after torture, and they're scared to death.
[00:40:09.215 --> 00:40:10.356]  Same thing with abusive children.
[00:40:10.376 --> 00:40:11.016]  They won't tell.
[00:40:11.036 --> 00:40:16.377]  I mean, this is serious business, folks.
[00:40:17.478 --> 00:40:18.758]  Serious business.
[00:40:19.972 --> 00:40:22.573]  And this is the type of people that want control of your lives.
[00:40:23.073 --> 00:40:24.133]  You figured this out yet?
[00:40:24.653 --> 00:40:32.896]  Of course the government can grab you and torture the living daylights out of you and find out what your fears are and break you just like Winston in 1984.
[00:40:34.376 --> 00:40:40.558]  All those were communist torture techniques that Blair, known as the pen name of...
[00:40:42.859 --> 00:40:43.960]  George Orwell wrote about it.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:54.409]  Because I'm sure you know that he was an imperial police officer who oversaw executions for what he called the capitalists in India.
[00:40:54.429 --> 00:41:05.318]  Then he left and thought that was the enemy and joined the communists and found out they were controlled by the same people and then worked for the BBC and found out they lied about a bunch of stuff and propaganda and then he went and wrote this book and died.
[00:41:06.879 --> 00:41:08.881]  That's old techniques of mind control.
[00:41:08.941 --> 00:41:11.623]  Making you love Big Brother after they're done with you.
[00:41:14.341 --> 00:41:27.468]  So, every time we look at these people, did you know that McVeigh was being seen by a special doctor, Charlie N. West, who's admitted, mentioned in the MKUltra hearings?
[00:41:28.389 --> 00:41:39.315]  This so happened, again, hidden in plain view, that he'd been seeing him, and then after the attack, he was seeing him, and then that was his doctor, right up until the execution.
[00:41:39.335 --> 00:41:42.076]  You know, they walked out Malvo yesterday.
[00:41:42.116 --> 00:41:43.497]  The guy was so drugged out.
[00:41:44.818 --> 00:41:48.440]  That guy was on so many drugs, he didn't have irises.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.160]  He had pupils.
[00:41:51.361 --> 00:41:52.241]  I don't even try to hide it.
[00:41:52.561 --> 00:41:55.943]  I went back and looked at the footage I had of McVeigh on 60 Minutes.
[00:41:55.983 --> 00:41:58.223]  Yeah, I did it all, I did it all, I did it all.
[00:41:59.164 --> 00:42:01.265]  The guy's eyes, I mean, just totally wiped out.
[00:42:01.725 --> 00:42:03.386]  Totally drugged, can barely talk.
[00:42:05.987 --> 00:42:08.228]  I mean, what's wrong with you people?
[00:42:08.948 --> 00:42:10.929]  You realize how evil the globalists are?
[00:42:10.969 --> 00:42:11.789]  This is not our government.
[00:42:13.537 --> 00:42:15.178]  Let's talk to, what is it, Andrew?
[00:42:15.358 --> 00:42:17.020]  Or is it Andy in California?
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:17.880]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:18.280]  Go ahead.
[00:42:19.401 --> 00:42:25.065]  Alex, you reported that Ariel Sharon had said that he would send Israeli hit teams to America.
[00:42:25.845 --> 00:42:28.187]  Yeah, it's Reuters, UPI, and AP.
[00:42:28.627 --> 00:42:33.491]  All the articles are in the new film, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, that I have not released yet.
[00:42:34.031 --> 00:42:37.793]  But you can type into a search engine and find those, or go to Infowars.com.
[00:42:38.634 --> 00:42:39.895]  Okay, that answers my question.
[00:42:40.415 --> 00:42:41.396]  What do you think about that?
[00:42:43.477 --> 00:42:45.018]  I think it's pretty scary.
[00:42:45.978 --> 00:42:47.278]  Yeah, no judge, no jury.
[00:42:47.318 --> 00:42:48.159]  Hey, it's the new America.
[00:42:48.199 --> 00:42:49.439]  Foreign hit teams come and kill you.
[00:42:49.479 --> 00:42:50.339]  Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:57.602]  Yeah, and I... Well, that's because they don't have enough troops, enough American people that aren't mind-controlled to go out and kill us.
[00:42:57.622 --> 00:43:02.824]  Because you could tell some special force has got to go kill some Arab or something, and they don't care, because it's for America.
[00:43:02.844 --> 00:43:03.404]  They're patriotic.
[00:43:03.424 --> 00:43:04.084]  They believe in it.
[00:43:04.344 --> 00:43:05.364]  They're being misdirected.
[00:43:05.905 --> 00:43:11.146]  But you can't tell them to go do that to an American.
[00:43:11.166 --> 00:43:12.647]  But don't worry, they've got folks that will do that.
[00:43:13.539 --> 00:43:22.423]  They got folks that will run over on the photographs of an American college girl and back over with an armored bulldozer.
[00:43:22.463 --> 00:43:23.364]  That's okay, isn't it?
[00:43:24.565 --> 00:43:25.985]  Why aren't more people talking about this?
[00:43:27.226 --> 00:43:28.246]  Well, it's just the new America.
[00:43:28.306 --> 00:43:30.187]  Freedom means foreign troops come and kill you.
[00:43:30.868 --> 00:43:34.810]  They got the KGB boss, former KGB head, is going to be helping Homeland Security.
[00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:35.350]  Special.
[00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:36.991]  It's all part of the freedom.
[00:43:37.031 --> 00:43:37.511]  How does it sound?
[00:43:39.497 --> 00:43:40.298]  I don't think I like it.
[00:43:41.038 --> 00:43:42.799]  You don't like the KGB coming to help?
[00:43:42.879 --> 00:43:43.940]  I mean, they're good folks, man.
[00:43:44.641 --> 00:43:45.461]  KGB loves you.
[00:43:47.723 --> 00:43:48.523]  Heard it on the news.
[00:43:51.385 --> 00:43:52.967]  All right, thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:43:53.367 --> 00:43:54.508]  I appreciate the call.
[00:43:54.788 --> 00:43:54.988]  All right.
[00:43:55.548 --> 00:44:03.434]  Yeah, you may remember Bush said about three months ago, it was about six months ago now, the CIA will kill American citizens if they, quote, are connected to Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:03.454 --> 00:44:06.316]  People went, well, they're suspected of Al-Qaeda connections.
[00:44:07.003 --> 00:44:10.005]  Type in, Bush says CIA can kill U.S.
[00:44:10.045 --> 00:44:10.425]  citizens.
[00:44:10.445 --> 00:44:11.286]  Just type that in.
[00:44:13.407 --> 00:44:14.488]  Just type it in.
[00:44:14.908 --> 00:44:19.611]  You know, the new film we're making has thousands of news articles.
[00:44:19.672 --> 00:44:23.234]  Yes, thousands.
[00:44:23.934 --> 00:44:24.715]  It's overwhelming.
[00:44:24.775 --> 00:44:26.496]  It's going to be right around three hours long.
[00:44:29.158 --> 00:44:33.621]  And it's just totally and completely jam-packed.
[00:44:33.681 --> 00:44:34.662]  You cannot order it yet.
[00:44:35.902 --> 00:44:36.383]  Police State 3.
[00:44:37.754 --> 00:44:38.694]  Total Enslavement.
[00:44:38.714 --> 00:44:40.875]  We'll be offering it very, very soon.
[00:44:42.236 --> 00:44:45.877]  Folks, but you won't get it, the film, completely if you don't get Police State 2000.
[00:44:45.937 --> 00:44:48.818]  That's the first one in Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:44:49.118 --> 00:44:52.140]  So we go from Police State to The Takeover to Total Enslavement.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.321]  And I think this will be the final film, folks.
[00:44:55.381 --> 00:44:58.362]  If we go much further, it'll be Total Death will be the name of the new film.
[00:44:59.142 --> 00:45:00.383]  Of course, we won't make it because we'll all be...
[00:45:05.523 --> 00:45:06.484]  Oh my goodness!
[00:45:07.084 --> 00:45:08.866]  Folks, you can just see what I see every day.
[00:45:08.947 --> 00:45:10.168]  It's all right here.
[00:45:10.228 --> 00:45:10.909]  It's all admitted.
[00:45:14.871 --> 00:45:15.411]  Oh, man.
[00:45:16.112 --> 00:45:16.612]  Oh, boy.
[00:45:17.072 --> 00:45:18.733]  Let's talk to Lou in Colorado.
[00:45:18.773 --> 00:45:19.634]  Lou, you're on the air.
[00:45:19.674 --> 00:45:20.254]  Welcome, sir.
[00:45:20.614 --> 00:45:21.174]  Hi, Alex.
[00:45:21.815 --> 00:45:25.417]  I just want to make a quick statement here before I get into what I want to talk about.
[00:45:25.637 --> 00:45:27.278]  I sent you that copy.
[00:45:27.798 --> 00:45:30.980]  I sent it by mail because I didn't want to distort it through fax or anything else.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.462]  A copy of that one by Philip Frenot.
[00:45:36.522 --> 00:45:41.065]  Madison and Jefferson put together the plans for how do you change a
[00:45:41.818 --> 00:45:43.719]  A constitutional republic into a monarchy?
[00:45:44.239 --> 00:45:44.559]  Yes.
[00:45:44.679 --> 00:45:49.482]  I sent it to that address you have for sending in for Brad Lamar.
[00:45:49.542 --> 00:45:50.302]  You're right.
[00:45:50.362 --> 00:45:51.003]  Thank you so much.
[00:45:51.023 --> 00:45:51.623]  Did you get that?
[00:45:52.103 --> 00:45:53.224]  I believe so, yes.
[00:45:53.284 --> 00:45:54.024]  It's in a blue envelope.
[00:45:54.104 --> 00:45:56.305]  It's something really worth reading because that lays down the plan.
[00:45:56.325 --> 00:46:02.929]  But anyhow, going back on this mind control a little bit, too, is I remember watching a long time ago on Channel 11.
[00:46:03.209 --> 00:46:06.430]  They talked about how they were doing an experiment with rats, like rats are very...
[00:46:08.172 --> 00:46:18.995]  A lot like people in their society type thing and they were constantly subjecting them to shocks and different things and turmoil which then made them more docile.
[00:46:19.976 --> 00:46:23.417]  Now that was on Channel 11 many years ago so this is part of that plan.
[00:46:23.477 --> 00:46:29.018]  Disaster after disaster, emergency after emergency people become more docile, more controllable.
[00:46:29.098 --> 00:46:37.721]  That's why they've had thousands of urban warfare training where the Delta Force covertly rents a police station one week before I mean they
[00:46:38.613 --> 00:46:40.775]  In Kingsville, we found out they planned this for two years.
[00:46:41.616 --> 00:46:44.578]  They paid, and the number is undisclosed.
[00:46:44.598 --> 00:46:51.003]  We're told it's in the millions, and public officials kind of nodded, so, well, we can't tell you, but they paid them millions.
[00:46:51.504 --> 00:46:54.847]  We know they paid them a large amount, and some cash was in some bags.
[00:46:55.207 --> 00:47:03.734]  According to the police in San Antonio, who refused them large black bags of cash, they built them a new law enforcement center.
[00:47:04.967 --> 00:47:14.574]  Quietly had them move out of it two days before and then had eight black helicopters attack and blow up the police station in the middle of the town next to a nursing home.
[00:47:15.695 --> 00:47:17.976]  Then they hit five other towns in South Texas.
[00:47:18.517 --> 00:47:25.341]  Screaming Czechoslovakian troops, rail machine guns, buildings blowing up, fire shooting out of buildings, buildings catching on fire.
[00:47:26.162 --> 00:47:27.463]  That's in Police State 2000.
[00:47:28.323 --> 00:47:33.187]  The news, the footage, the public officials, admitting foreign troops were there, admitting the bribery.
[00:47:34.455 --> 00:47:37.457]  So now it happens and people go, that's just what they do.
[00:47:38.018 --> 00:47:39.839]  Troops now, they blow it up.
[00:47:40.259 --> 00:47:41.480]  Do you see the acclimation?
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.440]  Good point, good point.
[00:47:42.681 --> 00:47:47.524]  Hey, Alex, also, what I really want to get into is something that you'll be interested in if you are aware of this.
[00:47:47.864 --> 00:47:49.005]  Your listeners certainly will.
[00:47:49.385 --> 00:47:54.248]  I'm going back through stage 1982 when McDonnell, remember Congressman Larry McDonnell?
[00:47:54.708 --> 00:47:59.854]  He had 34 colleagues co-sign a thing showing how the communists were trying to take over Mexico.
[00:47:59.934 --> 00:48:03.298]  There was actually a communist-led uprising in Mexico in 1968.
[00:48:03.358 --> 00:48:06.882]  Yeah, they sure got with McDonald, didn't they?
[00:48:07.023 --> 00:48:07.323]  Right.
[00:48:07.663 --> 00:48:09.686]  And then today they're actually running it.
[00:48:09.706 --> 00:48:13.290]  McDonald's letter said that the tens of thousands of Marxist terrorists from Latin America...
[00:48:16.433 --> 00:48:19.557]  Stay there and finish up on the other side.
[00:48:20.057 --> 00:48:23.421]  My point earlier was, these women were mind-controlled.
[00:48:23.501 --> 00:48:25.283]  Tortured and released, didn't do anything.
[00:48:26.845 --> 00:48:29.228]  And see, that's the government can do the same thing, and they have.
[00:48:32.094 --> 00:48:39.479]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:48:39.759 --> 00:48:44.482]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:48:44.722 --> 00:48:50.366]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:48:50.606 --> 00:48:55.127]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:48:55.347 --> 00:49:02.509]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:49:02.529 --> 00:49:07.050]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:09.730]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:16.672]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:49:16.912 --> 00:49:18.013]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:49:18.033 --> 00:49:18.274]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:41.817]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:49:41.997 --> 00:49:49.581]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:49.841 --> 00:49:52.983]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:49:53.243 --> 00:49:58.947]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:49:59.267 --> 00:50:05.429]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:09.670]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.611]  The water level is always visible.
[00:50:11.791 --> 00:50:17.753]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:50:17.973 --> 00:50:22.234]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:50:45.374 --> 00:50:50.640]  I'm talking about the beauty that only the creator can conceive, not the pesticide-ridden, genetically-modified genomes.
[00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:53.397]  It's such a simple way to make this world a better place.

[00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:52.852]  You know, I'll tell you, Lou brought up a really good point.
[00:51:53.372 --> 00:51:54.493]  Lou from Colorado.
[00:51:54.733 --> 00:51:59.015]  I've read those studies because I've read a lot of psychological studies trying to understand the New World Order.
[00:52:00.016 --> 00:52:01.677]  And yeah, they've done a lot of studies with rats.
[00:52:01.817 --> 00:52:05.919]  Rats and their colonies are the closest to humans.
[00:52:06.659 --> 00:52:07.560]  No, it's not monkeys.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.321]  It's not apes because humans get in big colonies.
[00:52:10.841 --> 00:52:11.982]  Monkeys and apes don't.
[00:52:12.665 --> 00:52:17.447]  And we're talking hundreds of thousands of rats, millions of rats in larger cities, in giant colonies.
[00:52:18.287 --> 00:52:21.168]  They have different smells for different colonies inside a city.
[00:52:21.568 --> 00:52:23.029]  They will have wars.
[00:52:24.329 --> 00:52:27.010]  This, you know, different groups of rats are very similar.
[00:52:27.031 --> 00:52:29.111]  Says a lot about us, I guess.
[00:52:30.232 --> 00:52:41.116]  And, yeah, they notice if they shock and torture colonies of rats and put them under a lot of stress, actually, if it's outside something they can't control, and there's really not a smell attached to it, they will...
[00:52:41.989 --> 00:52:42.450]  We're good to go.
[00:53:01.525 --> 00:53:02.725]  Think about how bad it's gotten.
[00:53:03.005 --> 00:53:13.489]  Imagine if I'd have written some science fiction book ten years ago, or you would have had, or you've been reading a book, and it said, In the New America Future, by 2003, children will be banned from playing dodgeball.
[00:53:13.569 --> 00:53:14.429]  Arrests will be made.
[00:53:14.449 --> 00:53:17.650]  It will be considered assault and violent if they're caught playing it secretly.
[00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:20.631]  Musical chairs is also one of the most evil games.
[00:53:21.297 --> 00:53:22.979]  This is how warped and sick it's gotten.
[00:53:23.339 --> 00:53:26.062]  Lou, finishing up real quick, then we'll go to Elliot and Howard and others.
[00:53:26.082 --> 00:53:26.542]  Go ahead, Lou.
[00:53:38.375 --> 00:53:47.344]  He was interviewed in Playboy, and he said there will be an export of communism, the revolution to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, then Mexico, charged by President Reagan.
[00:53:47.365 --> 00:53:53.551]  The Interior Minister replied, this is one historical prophecy of Ronald Reagan that is absolutely true.
[00:53:53.832 --> 00:53:54.692]  Here comes the good part.
[00:53:55.053 --> 00:53:57.556]  The Washington Times reported on March 27, 1985, that Thomas Borg had bragged,
[00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:03.411]  To a Nicaraguan political prisoner, we have Nicaragua.
[00:54:03.451 --> 00:54:07.133]  Soon we will have El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica and Mexico.
[00:54:07.533 --> 00:54:14.916]  One day, tomorrow, or five or fifteen years from now, we're going to take five to ten million Mexicans and they're going to have one thing on their mind.
[00:54:14.996 --> 00:54:24.519]  Cross the border, go into Dallas, go into El Paso, go into Houston, go into New Mexico, go into San Diego, and each one has been embedded in his mind, the idea of killing ten Americans.
[00:54:24.539 --> 00:54:26.100]  This is part of your open border.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.421]  Yeah, I remember that.
[00:54:27.561 --> 00:54:28.682]  Send me that news article.
[00:54:28.702 --> 00:54:29.202]  I remember that.
[00:54:29.262 --> 00:54:29.482]  Sure.
[00:54:29.662 --> 00:54:31.103]  Mail that to me, and God bless you, sir.
[00:54:31.123 --> 00:54:31.904]  Okay, take care.
[00:54:31.944 --> 00:54:33.625]  Thanks for the call, Lou.
[00:54:34.265 --> 00:54:46.333]  But you notice the bankers, the people that aren't the communists, fund the communists to break America up, to create that crisis, to create kind of a separatist movement in the Southwest like they have with the French separatists in Canada.
[00:54:46.813 --> 00:54:48.334]  And that break-off will happen.
[00:54:48.414 --> 00:54:49.155]  It's going to happen.
[00:54:49.495 --> 00:54:51.416]  And it's going to be fostered by Washington.
[00:54:51.756 --> 00:54:52.856]  The UN will be called in.
[00:54:52.876 --> 00:54:54.897]  That's still about 10, 15 years away.
[00:54:54.937 --> 00:55:06.021]  But you will see it happen unless we reach out as whites to blacks to Hispanics and realize what the bankers are doing to us, realize the communists, the fascists are all together bringing in the new world order.
[00:55:06.281 --> 00:55:08.961]  The all-seeing eyes above it all manipulating the scene.
[00:55:09.322 --> 00:55:16.484]  Total control, scientifically focused, giant computers running the battle simulations on how to destroy you and your family and totally enslave you.
[00:55:17.628 --> 00:55:19.789]  Before I end this hour, I'll come back with your calls and more news.
[00:55:19.869 --> 00:55:21.310]  Grab a pen and paper right now.
[00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:22.751]  You've heard a lot about my films.
[00:55:22.791 --> 00:55:25.132]  The newest are Roads of Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[00:55:25.332 --> 00:55:26.833]  I talked about the Police State videos.
[00:55:27.273 --> 00:55:28.974]  Find out who really carried out 9-1-1.
[00:55:29.014 --> 00:55:29.715]  Get the Roads of Tyranny.
[00:55:29.735 --> 00:55:30.655]  Get the Masters of Terror.
[00:55:31.896 --> 00:55:32.877]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:55:32.997 --> 00:55:34.538]  And your purchase supports this broadcast.
[00:55:34.578 --> 00:55:38.520]  And you're authorized to make copies of my films for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:55:39.204 --> 00:55:40.644]  Just call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:40.664 --> 00:55:41.985]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:44.266]  Or go to infowars.com or net.
[00:55:44.286 --> 00:55:48.727]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:56:06.471 --> 00:56:11.315]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[00:56:11.475 --> 00:56:13.256]  And get the films, make copies, spread the word.
[00:56:13.276 --> 00:56:17.419]  You can also record the show and hand it out to folks as well.
[00:56:17.439 --> 00:56:18.440]  That's another way to spread the word.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.461]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:56:21.663 --> 00:56:24.285]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:56:24.525 --> 00:56:30.269]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:56:30.509 --> 00:56:31.870]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:32.371]  In fact...
[00:56:35.879 --> 00:56:39.061]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:57:09.282 --> 00:57:13.403]  All right, my friends, already live into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:57:13.543 --> 00:57:17.724]  I'm here to defend America, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, our God-given rights.
[00:57:18.545 --> 00:57:30.949]  When Republicans come out and open our borders and try to get our guns and triple the size of the BATF and expand the Department of Education and sign on to UN treaties and give supercomputers to Communist China, nuclear reactors in North Korea...
[00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:37.031]  Try to restrict the First Amendment in elections with campaign finance reform and call themselves conservatives.
[00:57:37.332 --> 00:57:38.672]  That makes me sick.
[00:57:39.212 --> 00:57:43.414]  And the neocons running offense for them make me sick.
[00:57:43.914 --> 00:57:45.955]  And running defense for them make me sick.
[00:57:46.396 --> 00:57:49.437]  Wide open phones, a lot of calls in the second hour.
[00:57:50.677 --> 00:57:53.479]  Toll-free number to join me on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:57:53.499 --> 00:57:55.139]  I have more comments on the mindcontrolguy.com
[00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:08.268]  Who had kidnapped these five women, tortured them, controlled them, where when he released them, they wouldn't rat on him.
[00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:17.418]  That is the example, ladies and gentlemen, of how mind control works.
[00:58:17.478 --> 00:58:21.962]  Imagine if this scumbag, this human affluent, could do this, what...
[00:58:23.999 --> 00:58:24.960]  Can the government do?
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.341]  And they admit, what have they done?
[00:58:26.361 --> 00:58:28.383]  They're doing it on a mass scale with the TV, folks.
[00:58:28.443 --> 00:58:30.584]  So we'll get more into that in discussion.
[00:58:30.604 --> 00:58:31.325]  It needs to be discussed.
[00:58:31.345 --> 00:58:41.553]  It's a great example of what we're talking about here in criminal psychology and how they've scared us all to go along with this evil and how they're titrating the does, conditioning us to accept more and more.
[00:58:41.993 --> 00:58:52.542]  I beg government people out there listening, I beg everybody, get involved, face the horror of how bad things have gotten, how much liberty we've lost, who the real terrorists are, and let's stand up for America.
[00:58:54.019 --> 00:59:00.182]  Now, there is a ton of news, and I'm going to get to it early in the shower, but right now, let's get to these two callers who have been holding the longest, Elliot and Howard.
[00:59:00.622 --> 00:59:01.982]  Elliot, New York, you're on the air.
[00:59:02.022 --> 00:59:02.643]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:59:02.663 --> 00:59:06.204]  Appreciate you joining me, Elliot.
[00:59:07.265 --> 00:59:08.505]  Okay, Elliot's gone.
[00:59:08.725 --> 00:59:08.985]  Hello.
[00:59:09.566 --> 00:59:10.266]  Oh, you're there.
[00:59:10.386 --> 00:59:10.706]  Good.
[00:59:11.226 --> 00:59:12.207]  Glad we were able to get you.
[00:59:12.247 --> 00:59:12.487]  Go ahead.
[00:59:12.507 --> 00:59:13.127]  What's on your mind?
[00:59:14.087 --> 00:59:19.210]  Basically, I want to talk about my bread and butter, which is networking, this whole Cisco thing.
[00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:20.030]  It's nothing new.
[00:59:20.766 --> 00:59:25.631]  In 1998, there was an issue with 3Com doing the same thing with their switches that left the back door.
[00:59:25.652 --> 00:59:30.417]  Well, I mean, the Microsoft system sends back everything you do to some big giant system.
[00:59:30.437 --> 00:59:33.600]  And then when Microsoft got caught, they said, we don't know where the data goes.
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:34.922]  It was a glitch.
[00:59:36.269 --> 00:59:37.430]  Well, it does.
[00:59:37.531 --> 00:59:39.453]  Especially the new XP system.
[00:59:39.513 --> 00:59:43.017]  If it crashes, it asks you if it can send data.
[00:59:43.457 --> 00:59:44.619]  Nobody knows where that data goes.
[00:59:45.159 --> 00:59:47.602]  It says it sends it to Microsoft, but I highly doubt that.
[00:59:47.982 --> 00:59:53.929]  But anyway, with this whole Cisco thing, essentially, for those who don't know what a router is, it's a special computer.
[00:59:53.949 --> 00:59:55.531]  For those who don't know, it's
[00:59:56.471 --> 00:59:58.532]  They're the big integration network.
[00:59:58.572 --> 01:00:00.532]  They're the big hubs for the Internet.
[01:00:00.913 --> 01:00:01.153]  Right.
[01:00:02.173 --> 01:00:03.413]  They're backbone folks.
[01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:03.954]  They are the Internet.
[01:00:03.994 --> 01:00:07.835]  And they've been caught in massive surveillance without shallan and total information.
[01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:08.215]  Go ahead.
[01:00:08.495 --> 01:00:15.577]  Yeah, it's not hard to do that because what they do is they insert something called a sniffer onto a hub or a switch or a router.
[01:00:16.257 --> 01:00:19.778]  And basically what that does is it's like a magnifying glass.
[01:00:19.958 --> 01:00:21.819]  It analyzes the data as it goes by.
[01:00:22.751 --> 01:00:24.232]  What about a proxy browser and proxy servers?
[01:00:24.252 --> 01:00:25.053]  That's what InfoWars.net does.
[01:00:40.436 --> 01:00:58.360]  My internet, you know, the guy that provides it and the big company that runs it, medium-sized company, but good folks, tells me it's one of the best things out there because it at least slows them down and keeps a lot of the marketing people from being able to access you, which then is turned over to the fads, and they're using systems that can't crack that.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.201]  The best firewalls, because that's basically what a proxy is.
[01:01:03.146 --> 01:01:07.751]  The best firewalls are a combination of different technologies and proxy being one of them.
[01:01:07.991 --> 01:01:08.772]  Well, that's what he said.
[01:01:08.792 --> 01:01:14.338]  He said they have the firewall, they have the proxy servers, and they have the virtual browsers.
[01:01:14.618 --> 01:01:17.761]  He said with all three, it gives them a really hard time.
[01:01:17.781 --> 01:01:18.262]  Is that true?
[01:01:18.562 --> 01:01:23.948]  Yes, it takes extremely long time, even for those Gibson boxes that they have, those...
[01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:25.829]  What do they call them?
[01:01:25.889 --> 01:01:28.731]  Clemon or whatever the name of those supercomputers are.
[01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:29.591]  It even gives them a hard time.
[01:01:29.611 --> 01:01:29.991]  Praise.
[01:01:30.551 --> 01:01:30.751]  Yes.
[01:01:30.831 --> 01:01:31.272]  Stay there.
[01:01:31.332 --> 01:01:31.952]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:32.392 --> 01:01:34.193]  Let you finish up, Elliot, and then we'll go to Howard.
[01:01:34.213 --> 01:01:37.574]  And then I'm plunging back into the news bravely.
[01:01:38.455 --> 01:01:39.215]  Plunging into it.
[01:01:39.255 --> 01:01:40.836]  Believe me, I'm sick of plunging into it.
[01:01:40.856 --> 01:01:41.356]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:44.355 --> 01:01:50.304]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:01:50.524 --> 01:01:52.787]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[01:02:19.855 --> 01:02:21.496]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:47.030]  We're good to go.
[01:03:01.169 --> 01:03:02.689]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:03:21.074 --> 01:03:23.756]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?

[01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:26.070]  Call today.
[01:04:43.667 --> 01:04:45.847]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:04:46.428 --> 01:04:49.288]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:49.388 --> 01:04:55.549]  The New World Order stands.
[01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:58.390]  Its foundation is ignorance.
[01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:06.591]  The general public being sappy, being easily manipulated, believing the lies, not even knowing what your system of government is.
[01:05:07.931 --> 01:05:10.772]  Did you know they don't teach in school most of the rights anymore?
[01:05:11.613 --> 01:05:13.855]  They don't teach the separation of powers.
[01:05:13.895 --> 01:05:16.478]  They don't teach that our country is a constitutional republic.
[01:05:17.098 --> 01:05:19.360]  The difference between that and a democracy.
[01:05:20.922 --> 01:05:27.047]  Yeah, in the Greek democracy, if they voted to kill somebody, they'd throw them off a cliff just because they didn't like the way they looked or what they had to say.
[01:05:27.067 --> 01:05:28.389]  You can't do that in a republic.
[01:05:28.749 --> 01:05:31.431]  In a democracy, black people could go into slavery again.
[01:05:31.471 --> 01:05:32.032]  Did you know that?
[01:05:33.073 --> 01:05:37.357]  Yeah, if the white people and the Asians or people got together and said...
[01:05:38.882 --> 01:05:41.243]  Let's put all black people back in slave pens.
[01:05:41.783 --> 01:05:45.325]  In your democracy, that would happen.
[01:05:47.506 --> 01:05:48.866]  So that's the reality, folks.
[01:05:49.187 --> 01:05:52.228]  And the average cop, the average person in the military is a good person.
[01:05:52.828 --> 01:05:55.830]  That is, they don't overtly engage in evil.
[01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:59.512]  They just accept evil as good and think the system is okay.
[01:06:00.412 --> 01:06:05.575]  And you drive around in a neighborhood, you look at all the little houses, and everything looks happy and good.
[01:06:06.235 --> 01:06:07.775]  We have this Leave it to Beaver image.
[01:06:08.175 --> 01:06:13.136]  Imagine all the horrors because of government that those houses have gone through.
[01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:19.858]  Imagine the things that the culture had sold those families, how it had torn apart those homes.
[01:06:19.918 --> 01:06:26.139]  Imagine all the things that are going on right beneath the surface, the drug abuse, all the garbage.
[01:06:28.379 --> 01:06:33.060]  When you really start realizing what's going on right beneath the surface and now above the surface, it's horrible.
[01:06:33.968 --> 01:06:37.089]  And it is scary, but it's more scary to let it continue to grow.
[01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:59.479]  To watch the news whine and scream about one kidnapped girl, and then to say we're going to put in a FEMA takeover system called AMBER, when it has nothing to do with AMBER, and then to know that DynCorp has been caught kidnapping 200,000 women and children, shipped to undisclosed locations, caught in court, admitted it, nothing happened to them, you and diplomatic immunity, and the average American never heard about it, and will never hear about it.
[01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:16.578]  And to watch the very government involved in all this, posing as your savior, to know they're serial killers, literally running things at the top, to know that the globalists are a collection, a criminal society of parasites and sadists who enjoy evil.
[01:07:16.858 --> 01:07:18.179]  That's why they're where they're at.
[01:07:18.759 --> 01:07:22.041]  The very nature of the business, they're there in this corrupt system.
[01:07:22.281 --> 01:07:22.881]  Look at history.
[01:07:22.901 --> 01:07:24.642]  Look at what all dictators turn into.
[01:07:25.023 --> 01:07:25.843]  They weren't already evil.
[01:07:25.863 --> 01:07:26.624]  They become evil.
[01:07:26.904 --> 01:07:28.765]  Or someone even more evil replaces them.
[01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:33.908]  It is a system, a centrifugal system, that concentrates pure evil.
[01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.450]  Pure evil is now taking control.
[01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:47.135]  I cannot list all the crimes and the sickening, systematic destruction of intelligence and history and everything.
[01:07:49.250 --> 01:08:02.989]  Elliot in New York was talking about Cisco Systems, the big backbone internet people with the big FEMA spy arms in it, big echelon total information awareness system.
[01:08:03.772 --> 01:08:06.393]  Elliot, you know, you say you're a network guy with computers.
[01:08:06.433 --> 01:08:12.656]  I mean, you remember in the mid-'90s when they paid all those billions to have the networks put in the echelon snoop hubs?
[01:08:13.077 --> 01:08:20.560]  We'd report the financial news or the industry tech news, and then people would call in and go, there's no such thing.
[01:08:21.941 --> 01:08:28.344]  Now it's announced everywhere, Elliot, that, oh, yeah, we're watching you, we're listening to you, that's what America's all about.
[01:08:29.366 --> 01:08:30.987]  That's to create a chilling effect.
[01:08:31.007 --> 01:08:31.607]  Go ahead, Elliot.
[01:08:31.787 --> 01:08:32.868]  It's on Discovery Channel.
[01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:37.090]  I mean, if people don't watch TV, then that's their... But it's like the New World Order five years ago.
[01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.810]  It doesn't exist.
[01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:39.711]  You're a kook if you say it as they're announcing it.
[01:08:39.971 --> 01:08:41.492]  And now, oh yeah, there's a New World Order.
[01:08:41.672 --> 01:08:42.192]  It's incredible.
[01:08:42.212 --> 01:08:42.513]  Go ahead.
[01:08:42.793 --> 01:08:43.453]  Well, this is the thing.
[01:08:43.993 --> 01:08:48.215]  I know you know you play that Jello Biafra skit, which is awesome.
[01:08:48.236 --> 01:08:49.016]  He's an awesome guy.
[01:08:49.036 --> 01:08:50.277]  I don't know if you know this.
[01:08:50.357 --> 01:08:50.917]  He's a hacker.
[01:08:51.771 --> 01:08:54.152]  He's a hacker, and he goes to the 2600 forums.
[01:08:54.232 --> 01:08:55.873]  I don't know if you know what 2600 is.
[01:08:55.973 --> 01:08:56.773]  Yeah, I know.
[01:08:56.813 --> 01:08:58.193]  It's a magazine and a hacker group.
[01:08:58.213 --> 01:08:58.774]  All right.
[01:08:59.254 --> 01:09:00.314]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:09:00.814 --> 01:09:04.836]  If this news gets out to the hacker community, which just came out today, correct?
[01:09:05.736 --> 01:09:06.677]  Yeah, about Cisco.
[01:09:07.537 --> 01:09:10.338]  You're going to see this week some of the denial of service attacks.
[01:09:10.876 --> 01:09:11.697]  Well, that's terrible.
[01:09:12.737 --> 01:09:14.559]  Just horrible.
[01:09:14.579 --> 01:09:17.721]  No, seriously, because that actually then affects the other side.
[01:09:17.741 --> 01:09:21.483]  People can't get to InfoWars if the whole backbone's under attack.
[01:09:21.703 --> 01:09:23.345]  Well, no, I don't think they're going to attack the backbone itself.
[01:09:23.365 --> 01:09:29.589]  They're going to attack government-owned companies like Yahoo and all these other companies that have these fronts.
[01:09:30.689 --> 01:09:31.370]  Here's the problem.
[01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:32.610]  They're all into it.
[01:09:32.871 --> 01:09:38.994]  The government came to the telecommunications industry and said, we're making it a law, you have to do it.
[01:09:39.394 --> 01:09:44.477]  And telecommunications said, no way, this is going to cost billions, so they paid to have it put in.
[01:09:45.357 --> 01:09:46.118]  That's the problem.
[01:09:46.158 --> 01:09:46.918]  But yeah, you're right.
[01:09:46.938 --> 01:09:50.180]  But the problem with this is, everything is on this backbone.
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.221]  That's why they've gone directly to Cisco.
[01:09:53.365 --> 01:09:55.526]  Well, Cisco owns the Internet, you know?
[01:09:55.907 --> 01:09:59.789]  Cisco, 99% of the Internet runs on a Cisco router.
[01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:12.496]  So, you know, if people don't understand what's going on... Well, I think what you need to do, if you're angry about this, if you're a shareholder, I bet there's somebody out there driving in their car right now that owns 1,000 shares of Cisco.
[01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:19.220]  If you dump that Cisco and take your time, find another stock you think is better, if you dump that Cisco...
[01:10:21.612 --> 01:10:23.954]  That's the thing.
[01:10:24.394 --> 01:10:36.042]  I'm studying the Cisco security, and I'm really surprised that they would, you know, do that.
[01:10:36.122 --> 01:10:38.764]  I mean, I believe you because, like I said, 3Com did it.
[01:10:39.445 --> 01:10:42.207]  Well, no, I'm just reading off of CNET News.
[01:10:42.747 --> 01:10:43.988]  It's just upsetting to me, you know?
[01:10:44.288 --> 01:10:45.249]  Yeah, it says so.
[01:10:46.770 --> 01:10:48.051]  You know what else upsets me, Alex?
[01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:52.859]  The fact that I can't go on a train and not see guys with M16s, you know?
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.080]  Absolutely.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.442]  Do you think folks are going to wake up to what's happening, Elliot?
[01:10:59.163 --> 01:11:06.206]  Look, they're either going to wake up and fight an info war, a gun war, or an information security war.
[01:11:06.226 --> 01:11:08.808]  Something's going to have to happen because...
[01:11:10.126 --> 01:11:24.017]  Well, the problem is if you don't fight an information war and let folks know that we're wearing the white hats, they're wearing the black hats, the guys in the black hats are really good at putting a big white hat on and sitting there in front of a TV screen going, look, I'm the good guy, they're the bad guys.
[01:11:24.237 --> 01:11:32.223]  We've got to create our own infrastructure of information that is so key, every person being an info warrior with real info, not speculation, but the facts.
[01:11:32.842 --> 01:11:33.222]  We're good to go.
[01:12:03.306 --> 01:12:07.427]  And other Patriot for Profits, lick your lips.
[01:12:07.727 --> 01:12:09.427]  I'm not charging them to come speak.
[01:12:10.468 --> 01:12:15.169]  I found out they're trying to get other Patriots to come speak, and it's all about, I want $3,000, I want blah, blah.
[01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:17.009]  No, I'm doing this to support KCXL.
[01:12:17.029 --> 01:12:21.030]  They're charging $15 to get in because they've got to rent the hall and all that stuff.
[01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:26.931]  It's to go to support a station that's been putting me on the air for, I don't know, three years.
[01:12:27.071 --> 01:12:28.111]  And I'm going up there for free.
[01:12:28.131 --> 01:12:29.072]  They're going to pay for my hotel.
[01:12:29.792 --> 01:12:29.912]  And...
[01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:32.270]  There's a couple of my people up there.
[01:12:32.291 --> 01:12:33.631]  I mean, I will be there with videos and stuff.
[01:12:33.651 --> 01:12:36.992]  But the point is, I'm coming up there for a benefit.
[01:12:37.032 --> 01:12:37.733]  Well, let me just finish.
[01:12:37.993 --> 01:12:42.094]  For KCXL Radio, 1140, the Liberty Factor is what it's being called.
[01:12:42.134 --> 01:12:43.335]  Craig Roberts is going to be there.
[01:12:43.415 --> 01:12:44.615]  Colonel Roberts with other speakers.
[01:12:44.975 --> 01:12:53.418]  May 17th, location, Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center, 5200 Blue Ridge Boulevard, on I-70 between Kansas City and Independence, Missouri.
[01:12:53.438 --> 01:12:53.498]  And...
[01:12:55.783 --> 01:12:58.004]  It's going to be great, folks.
[01:12:58.024 --> 01:13:03.867]  Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center, Kansas City, Missouri, 5200 Blue Ridge Boulevard.
[01:13:03.907 --> 01:13:04.407]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:13:04.427 --> 01:13:09.429]  I was going to mention to you, you know, you're talking about this kidnapping thing.
[01:13:09.509 --> 01:13:23.296]  You know, on top of the Missouri State Capitol, they've got a statue, and it's Sures in Roman, and in Greek it's Demeter, but it's just the opposite in the encyclopedia across from Democracy, but
[01:13:24.019 --> 01:13:27.461]  The chief myth relating to Demeter has to do with Persephone.
[01:13:27.581 --> 01:13:33.684]  One day, while the beautiful girl was picking flowers, the earth opened, and Hades, god of the underworld, took her to be his queen.
[01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:36.545]  Demeter searched over the whole earth for her daughter.
[01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:41.888]  Finally, Helios, the sun god, told Demeter that Hades had taken the girl to the underworld.
[01:13:41.908 --> 01:13:45.790]  Well, you know, this is on top of the dome of the Missouri State Capitol.
[01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:47.851]  And, of course, it was placed there in 19...
[01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:50.199]  17, I think.
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:51.561]  But, you know, it's kind of funny.
[01:13:51.581 --> 01:13:53.363]  I was doing some research.
[01:13:53.383 --> 01:13:58.090]  Yeah, in the 1913 on, they put occult symbols everywhere.
[01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:58.690]  Right.
[01:13:59.031 --> 01:14:00.753]  I mean, you go look at the Supreme Court building.
[01:14:00.773 --> 01:14:01.995]  There's owls, demons...
[01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:04.692]  I mean, it's a joke, folks.
[01:14:05.272 --> 01:14:06.933]  It's all Illuminati symbolism.
[01:14:07.814 --> 01:14:09.694]  All of Washington, D.C.
[01:14:09.795 --> 01:14:10.455]  is laid out.
[01:14:10.495 --> 01:14:12.956]  I mean, the pyramid of Lucifer, folks, the all-seeing eye.
[01:14:12.996 --> 01:14:13.756]  That's exactly right.
[01:14:13.937 --> 01:14:16.158]  I mean, the encyclopedia will tell you what that is.
[01:14:16.258 --> 01:14:16.498]  Right.
[01:14:16.878 --> 01:14:17.258]  Go ahead.
[01:14:17.838 --> 01:14:28.344]  Well, you know, that's just what I was going to say, that, you know, it's also, you know, it talks about the also Hades, but, you know, the idea behind it is...
[01:14:30.027 --> 01:14:38.292]  Yeah, they put that up there, and he's up on top of the Capitol searching for freedom, searching for the people, because everybody's been pulled down into Hades.
[01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:39.353]  Right.
[01:14:39.373 --> 01:14:40.593]  So basically, what does that say?
[01:14:40.613 --> 01:14:41.954]  He's standing on top of Hades.
[01:14:42.014 --> 01:14:43.175]  The Capitol is Hades.
[01:14:43.515 --> 01:14:47.037]  Yeah, and we're under the enslavement of Satan.
[01:14:47.197 --> 01:14:51.160]  There's another word here that you need to explain is democracy.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.721]  There's two forms of democracy.
[01:14:52.741 --> 01:14:53.441]  There's indirect democracy.
[01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:55.670]  Look, I really do appreciate the call.
[01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:57.250]  Good points, and I hear you.
[01:14:57.310 --> 01:15:03.472]  Now you're talking about the modern monarchies like Juan Carlos in Spain, where he doesn't really do anything, though he has some veto power.
[01:15:03.552 --> 01:15:07.093]  And then you've got the Parliament, same thing in England.
[01:15:24.796 --> 01:15:25.676]  I appreciate the call.
[01:15:25.696 --> 01:15:26.957]  We'll come back and talk to Ken.
[01:15:27.397 --> 01:15:28.717]  That's it for calls for this hour.
[01:15:28.737 --> 01:15:29.318]  I'm sorry.
[01:15:29.498 --> 01:15:34.319]  We'll have open phones in the next hour, but I'll talk to Ken because I need to cover this news.
[01:15:34.359 --> 01:15:35.880]  There's two giant stacks here.
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:37.200]  Somebody's got to do it.
[01:15:38.681 --> 01:15:39.441]  So stay with us.
[01:15:40.521 --> 01:15:46.343]  And yes, my websites are prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, and infowars.net.
[01:15:46.444 --> 01:15:47.444]  All different websites.
[01:15:48.284 --> 01:15:50.645]  My wife does infowars.net and com.
[01:15:50.665 --> 01:15:51.085]  They're great.
[01:15:51.525 --> 01:15:53.086]  Paul Joseph Watson out in...
[01:15:54.392 --> 01:15:55.614]  Not in the United Kingdom.
[01:15:55.694 --> 01:15:57.476]  Does PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:58.457 --> 01:16:05.646]  And the PrisonPlanet.com is great because it has original articles I've written, stuff Watson's written, other great writers who are listeners to this show.
[01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:07.148]  We appreciate getting the word out.
[01:16:07.969 --> 01:16:12.755]  And he has hundreds of my best radio interviews saved in the audio section.
[01:16:13.599 --> 01:16:15.220]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:15.660]  Stay with me.
[01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:47.503]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world.
[01:16:47.743 --> 01:16:53.167]  The Aeronizer air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:16:53.367 --> 01:16:57.810]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[01:16:57.970 --> 01:17:00.972]  There are no moving parts, and it's ideal for odors and allergies.

[01:18:50.571 --> 01:19:01.859]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:19:02.079 --> 01:19:04.741]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:05.061 --> 01:19:09.164]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:19:09.384 --> 01:19:11.507]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:19:11.667 --> 01:19:13.529]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:19.777]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:19:20.018 --> 01:19:25.685]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:19:56.564 --> 01:19:57.424]  Jerry can help here too.
[01:19:57.444 --> 01:19:57.684]  The book,
[01:20:23.749 --> 01:20:28.433]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.

[01:20:35.738 --> 01:20:36.839]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:37.039 --> 01:20:38.300]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:56.016 --> 01:20:57.356]  War on corruption.
[01:20:57.476 --> 01:21:01.318]  Car-rushing the lies and disinformation.
[01:21:01.338 --> 01:21:02.798]  I don't call for this at all.
[01:21:02.818 --> 01:21:04.038]  We're in Fort Worth, Texas.
[01:21:04.698 --> 01:21:05.299]  You're on the air.
[01:21:05.359 --> 01:21:06.079]  Go ahead, Ken.
[01:21:06.419 --> 01:21:10.200]  Yeah, hey, Alex, Tom Ridge is live right now on C-SPAN 2.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:10.920]  Oh, great.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.561]  Tom Ridge, our illustrious leader.
[01:21:12.581 --> 01:21:13.201]  What is he saying?
[01:21:13.241 --> 01:21:13.641]  Give him a call.
[01:21:13.681 --> 01:21:16.182]  I'm just kind of watching while I'm talking to you.
[01:21:16.202 --> 01:21:18.242]  Hey, there's a video call while Reagan was shot.
[01:21:18.282 --> 01:21:19.342]  Maybe people could take a look at it.
[01:21:19.563 --> 01:21:20.303]  It's worth watching.
[01:21:20.623 --> 01:21:24.644]  Hey, you go to Amazon Books and put in FBI, and there's a whole string of books on there.
[01:21:25.091 --> 01:21:31.732]  And have you seen this court case by Schlund, S-C-H-L-U-N-D, the third, by George Bush on APFN?
[01:21:31.752 --> 01:21:32.572]  It's got 80 parts.
[01:21:33.193 --> 01:21:34.393]  You can print it out right now.
[01:21:35.413 --> 01:21:37.814]  Well, man, you're hitting me with too much info, Ken.
[01:21:37.854 --> 01:21:39.514]  I can't even keep track of it all.
[01:21:39.534 --> 01:21:41.834]  Go to APFN, American Patriots Friends Network.
[01:21:41.854 --> 01:21:42.094]  Yeah, I know.
[01:21:42.114 --> 01:21:42.755]  That's a good site.
[01:21:42.955 --> 01:21:47.575]  Okay, there's a court case by S-C-H-L-U-N-D, the third.
[01:21:48.116 --> 01:21:50.136]  And he brought the case against Daddy Bush.
[01:21:51.349 --> 01:21:52.129]  You can print it out.
[01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:53.030]  There's 80 parts.
[01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.991]  It's worth reading.
[01:21:54.051 --> 01:21:54.792]  It's almost a book.
[01:21:55.132 --> 01:21:57.094]  Hey, what is Lord Ridge saying?
[01:21:57.334 --> 01:21:59.997]  Just to call in and say he's on TV, what is Lord Ridge saying?
[01:22:01.218 --> 01:22:03.000]  He's talking about what they've been doing.
[01:22:03.749 --> 01:22:06.152]  Oh, taking over everything and slaving is just so good.
[01:22:06.792 --> 01:22:07.533]  So conservative.
[01:22:07.573 --> 01:22:08.274]  Hand over your guns.
[01:22:08.354 --> 01:22:08.554]  Okay.
[01:22:08.814 --> 01:22:09.515]  Hey, one more item.
[01:22:09.715 --> 01:22:13.379]  There's a book called Secret Societies of America left by Stephen Sorop.
[01:22:13.699 --> 01:22:20.386]  In there, he mentions that Dick Cheney is not skull and bone, but he's got nine of them in his family that was or are.
[01:22:20.566 --> 01:22:22.388]  Well, I mean, that's what MSNBC says.
[01:22:23.081 --> 01:22:32.023]  Yeah, that there are actually skull and bones groups in other universities secretly, and they have them in Tennessee, UT has one.
[01:22:32.783 --> 01:22:38.544]  Very internal groups, much smaller nodes of the larger group along familial family lines.
[01:22:39.164 --> 01:22:49.227]  People's families who've been in two or three generations are allowed to set up their own chapters in other sectors to expand the power of the cult of death.
[01:22:49.247 --> 01:22:50.807]  That's what they call it themselves, the cult...
[01:22:51.699 --> 01:22:55.800]  Of White Supremacy and Death is the true name of it.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.400]  Basically, it translates in Germany.
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.701]  In German.
[01:23:01.421 --> 01:23:03.122]  Nine of them and Chena's family are.
[01:23:03.322 --> 01:23:04.402]  Hey, let me ask you a question.
[01:23:04.422 --> 01:23:06.282]  You know that the FBI is snooping around the libraries?
[01:23:06.542 --> 01:23:07.182]  What do you think?
[01:23:07.202 --> 01:23:08.383]  They're going to go in and purge books?
[01:23:09.423 --> 01:23:11.063]  Well, you might as well purge books.
[01:23:11.103 --> 01:23:12.143]  It's about a chilling effect.
[01:23:12.303 --> 01:23:13.664]  Oh, watch what you read.
[01:23:13.944 --> 01:23:16.164]  That book's there, but if you read it, ooh.
[01:23:16.184 --> 01:23:17.084]  See, it's a chilling effect.
[01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:19.285]  What's the point of taking them out and never telling anybody?
[01:23:19.972 --> 01:23:21.953]  Well, the truth is they're never going to look at it.
[01:23:21.993 --> 01:23:22.974]  They can't keep track of it.
[01:23:22.994 --> 01:23:28.318]  If they knew everything you did with computers, they couldn't look at it all, track it all down, do anything with it.
[01:23:28.578 --> 01:23:32.320]  They're announcing all this to scare us so we don't read.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.921]  It's the equivalent of burning books.
[01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:34.442]  That's right.
[01:23:34.982 --> 01:23:37.163]  Thanks for the call, you evil right-winger, you.
[01:23:37.444 --> 01:23:37.684]  Later.
[01:23:37.704 --> 01:23:38.524]  Oh, I forgot.
[01:23:38.564 --> 01:23:40.266]  He's pro-gun, pro-family, pro-America.
[01:23:40.306 --> 01:23:40.986]  He's liberal.
[01:23:41.046 --> 01:23:41.486]  That's right.
[01:23:42.327 --> 01:23:43.868]  Barbara Boxer is now conservative.
[01:23:43.908 --> 01:23:45.189]  She's for arming the pilots.
[01:23:48.429 --> 01:23:49.249]  I can't believe that.
[01:23:49.269 --> 01:23:49.870]  That's so funny.
[01:23:50.190 --> 01:23:51.391]  Bush tried to block Army and the policy.
[01:23:51.411 --> 01:23:52.292]  Barbara Boxer wanted it.
[01:23:52.872 --> 01:23:54.974]  Okay, now, I'm sitting here looking at all this news.
[01:23:55.094 --> 01:23:56.576]  I want to go back over this just briefly.
[01:23:57.056 --> 01:23:59.338]  I'm going to come back and get to all the fresh news on Iraq.
[01:24:00.499 --> 01:24:06.684]  I'll have time to cover it all, perhaps even slowly, so we can get to all of it in the next 27 minutes after this break.
[01:24:07.165 --> 01:24:08.386]  I've got a couple minutes right now.
[01:24:11.756 --> 01:24:13.957]  And I want to be able to go over this.
[01:24:14.457 --> 01:24:15.857]  Again, this is what I'm talking about.
[01:24:16.037 --> 01:24:27.821]  You don't think the government can engage in mind control on a mass scale or on the scale of just kidnapping someone and turning them into a hitman to go out or a mass shooter, which we know they've done.
[01:24:28.726 --> 01:24:29.988]  There are Senate reports.
[01:24:30.108 --> 01:24:31.671]  Our government admits it, okay?
[01:24:32.031 --> 01:24:33.353]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[01:24:33.373 --> 01:24:34.415]  It's like New World Order.
[01:24:34.935 --> 01:24:36.217]  The New World Order is public.
[01:24:36.598 --> 01:24:37.840]  They're writing about it every day.
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:40.363]  I see major newspapers saying it's a New World Order every day.
[01:24:40.704 --> 01:24:41.725]  Presidents give speeches.
[01:24:42.066 --> 01:24:44.670]  But when I say it, it doesn't exist because I'm against it.
[01:24:46.204 --> 01:24:49.605]  It's like if you say the government's bad, they kidnap people and make mind control slaves.
[01:24:50.025 --> 01:24:51.966]  They say, oh, you're crazy.
[01:24:52.046 --> 01:24:54.447]  And then you go, well, the news just said it, but they say it's good.
[01:24:54.607 --> 01:24:55.307]  Oh, well, it's good.
[01:24:55.647 --> 01:24:58.088]  And then simultaneously, they're practicing mind control.
[01:24:58.348 --> 01:24:59.589]  The person will say it doesn't exist.
[01:24:59.609 --> 01:25:00.449]  They're under mind control.
[01:25:00.469 --> 01:25:04.170]  If there's any responsibility or anything scary, it doesn't exist.
[01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:06.451]  But if the government says it, it exists, and it's good.
[01:25:06.471 --> 01:25:07.831]  You understand the total mind control?
[01:25:08.331 --> 01:25:09.372]  That's on a mass scale.
[01:25:11.012 --> 01:25:15.594]  On the microscopic level here, profile of kidnapper, it's all about...
[01:25:16.266 --> 01:25:16.827]  Control.
[01:25:16.867 --> 01:25:17.887]  This is the post-standard.
[01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:20.549]  Absolute domination.
[01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:25.513]  It explains why Jelmeski alleged victims wouldn't flee.
[01:25:26.794 --> 01:25:34.541]  The last teenager, John Jelmeski, allegedly held captive, seemed to have had a few opportunities, had a few opportunities to flee, but didn't take them.
[01:25:36.302 --> 01:25:42.927]  It may be hard to fathom, experts say, but it shows the level of control kidnappers can have over their victims.
[01:25:42.947 --> 01:25:43.608]  What does a judge do?
[01:25:44.733 --> 01:25:47.374]  They call you in, they yell at you, they say sign documents.
[01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:48.814]  It's totally criminal what they're doing.
[01:25:49.114 --> 01:25:52.895]  You sign documents, you plea bargain, haven't done anything, you go to prison for no reason.
[01:25:53.616 --> 01:25:56.337]  It's all levels of mind control, levels of intimidation.
[01:25:57.617 --> 01:26:02.298]  And you wonder, and the government admits they can grab you, drug you, torture you, make you a total mind control slave.
[01:26:02.618 --> 01:26:03.919]  And people go, oh, they couldn't do that.
[01:26:04.339 --> 01:26:14.242]  But this guy would torture, could have women torture him for months, have them as slaves for a year to six months, release them, and five years later they weren't telling on him.
[01:26:16.946 --> 01:26:18.768]  Starting to get the picture.
[01:26:18.988 --> 01:26:20.770]  It's mind control.
[01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:23.893]  The way to defeat mind control is to be aware of it.
[01:26:23.993 --> 01:26:25.455]  The different layers of it.
[01:26:26.136 --> 01:26:30.700]  You were under mind control attack by Peter Jennings and Rush Limbaugh.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.401]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:33.383 --> 01:26:34.424]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.784 --> 01:26:36.386]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.307 --> 01:26:39.970]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.283 --> 01:26:47.184]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:26:47.404 --> 01:26:52.846]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:26:53.106 --> 01:26:54.507]  Ideal for... The call is 877-605-9200.
[01:26:54.567 --> 01:26:54.747]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:27:06.463 --> 01:27:12.487]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:27:13.088 --> 01:27:16.110]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:18.991 --> 01:27:24.355]  I'm here doing this show, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.704]  And of course, during the day from 11 a.m.
[01:27:28.764 --> 01:27:29.365]  until 2 p.m.
[01:27:29.725 --> 01:27:33.892]  Central Standard Time, we go out on the AM and FM dial.
[01:27:33.912 --> 01:27:35.454]  A lot of new affiliates turning us on.
[01:27:35.474 --> 01:27:37.277]  We love all you guys and gals.
[01:27:37.317 --> 01:27:37.898]  God bless you.
[01:27:38.659 --> 01:27:41.123]  Be sure, listeners, to support them and support their sponsors.
[01:27:42.092 --> 01:27:54.620]  And we also go out on shortwave during the day at 12.172 and another frequency 93.20 and at night at 5.085 and 68.90.
[01:27:55.361 --> 01:28:01.064]  One more little announcement and then I'm going to get back into the calls.
[01:28:03.125 --> 01:28:05.587]  Or get back into the news and then into the calls.
[01:28:07.088 --> 01:28:09.950]  Again, there's a benefit for KCXL Radio.
[01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:11.713]  We're good to go.
[01:28:34.395 --> 01:28:41.178]  I don't like to brag, but a lot of the so-called patriots disgust me because the radio stations ask them to come speak, and I can't go to a bunch of other stations.
[01:28:41.198 --> 01:28:42.178]  So I'm going to K6L.
[01:28:42.218 --> 01:28:43.799]  Maybe a year later I'll go somewhere else or something.
[01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:48.701]  And I'm proud of myself because I said, you know, I don't want a bunch of money to come speak to you guys.
[01:28:49.401 --> 01:28:53.643]  Go ahead and sell your tickets to help the station and expand what you're doing.
[01:28:53.683 --> 01:28:55.304]  That's what they're going to do.
[01:28:55.544 --> 01:28:56.364]  I said, you go ahead.
[01:28:57.225 --> 01:29:00.266]  Just give me a hotel, and I'll come up with my staff, and I'll pay them.
[01:29:01.013 --> 01:29:02.034]  And I'm proud of that.
[01:29:02.354 --> 01:29:07.556]  I'd like to see more patriots lead by example and do those sorts of things.
[01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:08.496]  You know, my films.
[01:29:09.037 --> 01:29:13.859]  I show you can make copies of my videos for non-profit educational purposes if you don't sell them.
[01:29:14.339 --> 01:29:16.760]  You can make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:29:17.401 --> 01:29:18.861]  I don't know anyone else that does that.
[01:29:18.901 --> 01:29:20.162]  I've heard others that refuse.
[01:29:20.982 --> 01:29:23.403]  Well, if somebody does that, they really don't care, folks.
[01:29:24.084 --> 01:29:24.524]  Because...
[01:29:26.875 --> 01:29:28.677]  That's the only way we're going to affect change.
[01:29:28.717 --> 01:29:32.160]  To just sell a few thousand copies of a video isn't going to do much.
[01:29:33.441 --> 01:29:44.470]  But if you get my videos and you make 20 copies apiece and you give them to people and you tell them to make copies, thousands turn into millions.
[01:29:45.211 --> 01:29:46.632]  Millions.
[01:29:47.353 --> 01:29:50.656]  And I do radio interviews across the country.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.423]  From Ithaca, New York, to L.A., California, to Houston, Texas, to Dallas, to wherever.
[01:29:59.364 --> 01:30:00.825]  To Bowling Green, Kentucky.
[01:30:01.345 --> 01:30:04.267]  And people call in and they say, I've seen your videos.
[01:30:04.327 --> 01:30:05.467]  And I ask them, did you get it for me?
[01:30:05.487 --> 01:30:06.928]  And they go, no, my neighbor made a copy.
[01:30:06.948 --> 01:30:08.169]  You got a copy of a copy.
[01:30:08.609 --> 01:30:10.550]  I saw it on AXS TV and recorded it.
[01:30:11.010 --> 01:30:14.052]  My Christian TV station aired 30 minutes of it.
[01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:16.331]  And I did order a copy.
[01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:17.631]  Occasionally you hear something like that.
[01:30:18.192 --> 01:30:20.153]  Commercial TV stations have aired it.
[01:30:20.193 --> 01:30:24.775]  I have a deal where it's not copyrighted for broadcast, non-profit broadcast, or access, or whatever.
[01:30:26.015 --> 01:30:26.896]  We've got to do this.
[01:30:27.096 --> 01:30:29.757]  Business owners, you've got to sponsor radio stations.
[01:30:30.277 --> 01:30:31.078]  Tell the truth.
[01:30:31.998 --> 01:30:33.599]  That's how you support getting the word out.
[01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.261]  I've done all I can for this country, and yeah, I'm proud of it.
[01:30:39.201 --> 01:30:40.662]  I don't really toot my horn enough.
[01:30:42.119 --> 01:30:47.624]  But I'm only tooting it, hoping that people out there will lead by example and will tell the truth and will get involved.
[01:30:48.404 --> 01:30:53.508]  And I hope you will come to the benefit for K6L Radio, the Liberty Factor, a lot of great speakers.
[01:30:53.528 --> 01:30:54.609]  Of course, I'm the anchor of it.
[01:30:55.050 --> 01:31:00.174]  I was going to be the only speaker, and I said, you know, I think I'll get others to come.
[01:31:00.194 --> 01:31:04.117]  And Colonel Craig Roberts is coming and some others that are about to be announced here in a second.
[01:31:05.198 --> 01:31:06.058]  So you don't want to miss it.
[01:31:06.159 --> 01:31:07.620]  It's K6L 1140, the Liberty Factor.
[01:31:10.646 --> 01:31:20.910]  May 17, 2003, Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center, 5200 Blue Ridge Boulevard on I-70 between Kansas City and Independence, Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:27.432]  Because I appreciate their commitment three years carrying this show, but I am coming up there, I'm going to pick up the third hour.
[01:31:27.893 --> 01:31:31.794]  Because, you know, I get complaints every day.
[01:31:32.654 --> 01:31:35.275]  And imagine what they get, that my third hour isn't on there.
[01:31:36.096 --> 01:31:36.956]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:31:38.286 --> 01:31:40.107]  I'm tired of it, so I'm coming up there.
[01:31:40.147 --> 01:31:40.987]  Put me on the third hour.
[01:31:41.768 --> 01:31:43.508]  I'm told they might put me on at night, though, or something.
[01:31:44.269 --> 01:31:46.029]  At night, too, so I don't know.
[01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:51.472]  But we help those who help get the word out to the country, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:56.454]  So it's $15 to get in, and they're renting the place, the gun show that holds 8,000 people.
[01:31:56.494 --> 01:31:58.435]  I doubt we'll have that, but I bet we're going to have thousands.
[01:31:59.315 --> 01:31:59.995]  And it's $15 to get in.
[01:32:02.503 --> 01:32:07.466]  To the event that supports KCXL that carries a lot of shows over the last six years, I'm told.
[01:32:07.766 --> 01:32:08.626]  They carry me for three.
[01:32:09.307 --> 01:32:11.588]  That talk about the New World Order and the reality.
[01:32:12.028 --> 01:32:15.189]  Real right-wing radio, which you can call populist radio, really.
[01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:20.752]  People that actually believe, if you call yourself a conservative, that you don't reinstate the Clinton gun ban.
[01:32:20.792 --> 01:32:24.694]  You know, radicals like that are on the station.
[01:32:25.755 --> 01:32:29.917]  And so we want to keep it that way so that doesn't go, you know, all sports or something.
[01:32:31.809 --> 01:32:33.230]  We want to support KCXL 1140.
[01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:35.810]  There are things your station can do.
[01:32:36.331 --> 01:32:39.371]  I think all these stations out there that carry us ought to open bookstores.
[01:32:39.411 --> 01:32:41.472]  KCXL has done it years ago.
[01:32:41.912 --> 01:32:42.972]  They've been very successful.
[01:32:44.093 --> 01:32:50.835]  I think all of the stations out there that carry this show ought to have a bookstore and ought to carry Patriot titles and real conservative titles.
[01:32:51.255 --> 01:32:52.635]  That means you're pro-America.
[01:32:52.655 --> 01:32:53.975]  It can't mean you're pro-UN.
[01:32:55.416 --> 01:32:57.016]  You've got these neocon conservatives.
[01:32:57.036 --> 01:32:58.077]  We're not talking about those.
[01:32:58.677 --> 01:32:59.377]  You ought to all do it.
[01:33:00.578 --> 01:33:01.660]  And that's a good point.
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:08.991]  I really hope that folks will get my videos.
[01:33:09.151 --> 01:33:12.015]  I've made eight films, and I've written a book, Ascent to Tyranny.
[01:33:12.035 --> 01:33:15.801]  The book's $12, 230 pages, full of graphics and diagrams.
[01:33:16.997 --> 01:33:22.658]  And a lot of folks are big on reading and like to learn by reading, so we offer the book for that.
[01:33:22.698 --> 01:33:28.559]  It's about 9-1-1, a great New World Order overview, and what their master plan is, and the Patriot Act, and the rest of it.
[01:33:28.839 --> 01:33:29.639]  It's a really good book, $12.
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:31.900]  I suggest you get it.
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:38.341]  My films are $25.95, all over two hours, and they're $20 if you order three or more.
[01:33:38.441 --> 01:33:39.281]  Big discount there.
[01:33:39.301 --> 01:33:41.242]  $18 discount on a three-tape special.
[01:33:41.302 --> 01:33:42.582]  It gets bigger as you order more tapes.
[01:33:43.456 --> 01:33:48.779]  So call toll-free, don't wait, get my videos that are really waking people up, and make copies.
[01:33:48.799 --> 01:33:50.821]  1-888-253-3139 That's 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or Net.
[01:34:07.128 --> 01:34:14.671]  Or you can simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:34:14.771 --> 01:34:18.373]  Again, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, or 1-888-
[01:34:29.817 --> 01:34:31.377]  888-253-3139.
[01:34:32.097 --> 01:34:33.638]  Why you wouldn't get the police tape videos?
[01:34:33.678 --> 01:34:34.938]  Why you wouldn't get the road to tyranny?
[01:34:35.479 --> 01:34:36.519]  Or the masters of terror?
[01:34:36.999 --> 01:34:39.280]  Why you wouldn't get dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove?
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:42.041]  You want to see what your Christian president does there with Moloch?
[01:34:43.102 --> 01:34:44.642]  Yeah, it's right out of Eyes Wide Shut.
[01:34:45.342 --> 01:34:46.683]  Then I don't know what I can do for you.
[01:34:46.703 --> 01:34:46.743]  888-253-3139.
[01:34:54.566 --> 01:34:58.368]  All right, let me, in the 20 minutes we've got left here in this hour, get straight into news.
[01:34:58.908 --> 01:34:59.608]  There is a lot of it.
[01:35:01.209 --> 01:35:04.590]  Galloway, I'm the victim of Blair's revenge.
[01:35:05.131 --> 01:35:07.832]  Sunday Herald, Blair's the president over there.
[01:35:08.472 --> 01:35:15.215]  Exclusive, it's clear that the war party, the UK and the US, want to silence opponents.
[01:35:16.309 --> 01:35:20.051]  It says, George Galloway claims he has been set up by the British and U.S.
[01:35:20.071 --> 01:35:26.235]  governments to exact revenge for his high-profile anti-war campaigning over the invasion of Iraq.
[01:35:27.615 --> 01:35:32.558]  An exclusive interview yesterday with the Sunday Herald, Galloway said, what is clear is that the war party, meaning both the U.S.
[01:35:32.578 --> 01:35:32.818]  and U.K.,
[01:35:39.235 --> 01:35:46.239]  Determined to exact revenge and to silence the remaining opponents that have for what they have done.
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:51.502]  As evidence of their desire to push for the political opponents, Galloway cited U.S.
[01:35:51.542 --> 01:35:58.066]  Secretary of State Colin Powell's statement last week that France would face consequences because of its opposition to the U.S.-led war in Iraq.
[01:36:00.647 --> 01:36:03.049]  France has got about 3 million Muslims, folks.
[01:36:03.089 --> 01:36:05.050]  That's why they're against it, and you better wake up to that.
[01:36:06.608 --> 01:36:08.488]  Very, very violent ones, by the way.
[01:36:08.909 --> 01:36:12.549]  MP may be tried as traitor, and that's the London Guardian headline.
[01:36:12.569 --> 01:36:24.972]  George Galloway, the anti-war Labour MP, Member of Parliament, who is using, who is suing over allegations he secretly took money from Saddam Hussein, faces the prospect of a criminal prosecution for treachery.
[01:36:26.172 --> 01:36:34.194]  And it goes on to say in an interview with Abu Dhabi TV during the Iraq conflict, Galloway said the best thing British troops can do is to refuse to obey illegal orders.
[01:36:37.808 --> 01:36:41.729]  Well, folks, it's not treason to tell people not to follow legal orders.
[01:36:41.869 --> 01:36:46.531]  I mean, tell the Nazis, you know, don't shoot that person in the back of the head.
[01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:48.132]  That's what Nirenberg said.
[01:36:48.152 --> 01:36:50.812]  And that was his quote.
[01:36:51.933 --> 01:36:55.994]  And he has... They're going after him for treason charges.
[01:36:56.294 --> 01:37:02.436]  They're calling in this country for anyone that criticizes any government policy because, you know, the war on terror is this foggy thing.
[01:37:02.696 --> 01:37:06.918]  Complain about checkpoints, complain about surveillance, complain about those hover drones.
[01:37:07.606 --> 01:37:08.506]  You're a traitor.
[01:37:09.247 --> 01:37:10.567]  And the war will never end, they've told us.
[01:37:10.607 --> 01:37:13.988]  It's an endless shadowy terrorist who will just keep attacking us.
[01:37:14.048 --> 01:37:16.989]  And, oh, the government hates it, but they'll have to get total power and run our lives.
[01:37:17.389 --> 01:37:19.570]  They don't want to run everything, but they're going to, don't worry.
[01:37:19.630 --> 01:37:24.011]  And Halliburton hates being given a $7 billion contract, no bids allowed.
[01:37:24.051 --> 01:37:26.592]  But it's a new age of corruption, folks.
[01:37:28.354 --> 01:37:31.495]  And it goes on, New York Times playing the left-wing part.
[01:37:32.636 --> 01:37:39.879]  We're not lying, a Bush administration official told ABC News, but the administration was just engaging in a matter of emphasis.
[01:37:39.919 --> 01:37:46.262]  The official was referring to the way the administration hiked the threat of Saddam Hussein's weapons posed against the United States.
[01:37:47.182 --> 01:37:56.967]  A British newspaper, The Independent, reports that intelligence agencies on both sides of the Atlantic were furious that briefings they gave political leaders were distorted in the rush to war.
[01:37:58.297 --> 01:38:00.819]  Well, Capitol Hill broke it, and AP reported on it.
[01:38:00.899 --> 01:38:06.844]  It was admitted that top CIA and FBI people by top analysts, not gangsters like the leadership.
[01:38:07.965 --> 01:38:09.787]  Tenet, I mean, the guy's ready for the Sopranos.
[01:38:09.827 --> 01:38:13.190]  It's the way he looks, folks, and talks, much less his activities.
[01:38:13.650 --> 01:38:16.052]  I mean, you know, you can judge a book by its cover in his case.
[01:38:16.733 --> 01:38:18.695]  He isn't doing it, but some of the mid-level folks are.
[01:38:19.916 --> 01:38:21.497]  They said, Saddam doesn't have any of this.
[01:38:21.537 --> 01:38:22.218]  He's not a threat.
[01:38:22.238 --> 01:38:24.179]  He's the most stone-aged country over there.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:25.901]  What about North Korea?
[01:38:26.647 --> 01:38:30.290]  And they told them, you create false terror alerts to, quote, create hysteria.
[01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:32.712]  That's mainstream, folks.
[01:38:34.674 --> 01:38:45.684]  So it now comes out that Galloway has proven the documents saying he got money from some group that might have supported Saddam or forgeries.
[01:38:46.184 --> 01:38:52.109]  Our government admits, folks, they created fake nuclear documents from an African country to Saddam.
[01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:53.831]  Our government made it up.
[01:38:55.655 --> 01:39:03.662]  Didn't just, oh, accidentally think it was chemical weapons or something, you know, like they keep doing on accident, but falsifying, making false documents.
[01:39:05.824 --> 01:39:07.426]  I mean, come on!
[01:39:08.507 --> 01:39:09.568]  And it goes on and on.
[01:39:09.588 --> 01:39:10.348]  It doesn't matter, though.
[01:39:10.428 --> 01:39:11.429]  Treason charges.
[01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:16.314]  And it turns out, if you or I call in a bomb threat, we go to jail and we should, but not when these guys do it.
[01:39:16.794 --> 01:39:19.637]  Jobless and hopelessness may...
[01:39:20.892 --> 01:39:23.074]  As the nation enters a third year of difficult economic times...
[01:39:48.064 --> 01:39:52.768]  These unemployed, from factory workers to investment bankers, the wonderful naphthen gas really helped you, didn't it?
[01:39:53.268 --> 01:39:59.734]  Have dropped out of the labor force and entered the invisible ranks of the people not counted in the unemployment rate.
[01:40:00.755 --> 01:40:01.695]  And how were they living?
[01:40:02.456 --> 01:40:03.777]  They sold their houses.
[01:40:03.817 --> 01:40:05.619]  They moved into dirty little apartments.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:09.482]  You own a $200,000 house, you sell it, you downgrade.
[01:40:11.295 --> 01:40:16.156]  And you try to get a job at McDonald's, they're laying off about 10% of their workforce, so is everybody else.
[01:40:16.536 --> 01:40:17.977]  So even the precious service jobs.
[01:40:18.257 --> 01:40:20.577]  You think you'll get a job doing customer service at Dell?
[01:40:20.957 --> 01:40:23.698]  Sorry, that just got exported to India.
[01:40:25.558 --> 01:40:26.379]  Think you'll get a job?
[01:40:26.619 --> 01:40:27.699]  No, you won't, folks.
[01:40:28.299 --> 01:40:28.839]  And they knew it.
[01:40:28.859 --> 01:40:35.921]  But the same government that tells you how great the war on terror is is the same one that told you NAFTA and GATT were going to make you rich.
[01:40:38.121 --> 01:40:39.042]  Well, did it?
[01:40:39.542 --> 01:40:40.122]  No, it didn't.
[01:40:41.761 --> 01:40:46.162]  And so the unemployment rate is actually about 10% right now.
[01:40:46.182 --> 01:40:46.982]  Yeah!
[01:40:47.362 --> 01:40:49.683]  It's not 5%, 6%, like they say.
[01:40:50.143 --> 01:40:50.783]  It's more like 10%.
[01:40:50.923 --> 01:40:59.904]  And by the way, some say it's actually 15% because they count everybody that's working two jobs, they count that twice.
[01:40:59.924 --> 01:41:01.905]  You've got 287 million people, they count that.
[01:41:01.925 --> 01:41:03.625]  Uh-huh.
[01:41:03.965 --> 01:41:08.326]  And so while you're fighting with the illegal alien from China or Mexico for a job...
[01:41:09.722 --> 01:41:10.803]  Huffing the TV.
[01:41:11.443 --> 01:41:12.703]  Just remember that.
[01:41:13.064 --> 01:41:16.505]  You're competing with people in India, in Russia, in China.
[01:41:18.026 --> 01:41:20.107]  The jobs are leaving Mexico now to China.
[01:41:21.468 --> 01:41:22.728]  Oh yeah, it's that bad, folks.
[01:41:23.148 --> 01:41:28.751]  Miami journalist shipped and plannable ID company puts product into science, writer.
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:30.700]  And anything for hype.
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:34.462]  They first lied and said that all the hospitals had gotten their injectors in Miami.
[01:41:34.882 --> 01:41:36.122]  Turned out it was a total lie.
[01:41:36.662 --> 01:41:39.283]  They had signed a contract with the Bureau of Prisoners of California.
[01:41:39.303 --> 01:41:41.544]  That came out, and California Bureau had to drop that.
[01:41:41.864 --> 01:41:44.865]  Yeah, forcible implantation, a little too scary for folks.
[01:41:45.405 --> 01:41:49.806]  Don't worry, the kids are all being taught with their time life for kids in the school, though, that chips are fun.
[01:41:49.826 --> 01:41:52.027]  There's a man called Mr. Chipper.
[01:41:52.607 --> 01:41:53.908]  He wants you to get chipped.
[01:41:53.968 --> 01:41:54.968]  That's the promotion.
[01:41:56.553 --> 01:41:59.896]  And they got Spy TV for kids in Canada about how every child needs to be chipped.
[01:41:59.916 --> 01:42:00.677]  It's on their website.
[01:42:01.137 --> 01:42:07.063]  Meanwhile, a June deadline looms for the financially troubled company to pay out the $30 million IBM loan.
[01:42:07.403 --> 01:42:08.604]  Funny, I reported that first.
[01:42:08.644 --> 01:42:10.987]  You know, about two years ago, I read their financial filings.
[01:42:11.527 --> 01:42:13.329]  Not just IBM were on that daily.
[01:42:14.230 --> 01:42:18.193]  The Communist Chinese Army owns the other half.
[01:42:18.454 --> 01:42:19.715]  And that's where the plant's being built.
[01:42:20.518 --> 01:42:29.927]  And don't worry, they're going to be pulled out the next year because the Army has already told all its top officers you'll soon all be getting implanted chips.
[01:42:31.609 --> 01:42:44.201]  Applied Digital Solutions, maker of implantable identification chips for humans, is ramping up a new medical blitz, media blitz, with the chipping of a reporter and unveiling yesterday in London of a new temperature-sensitive chip.
[01:42:45.129 --> 01:42:58.595]  Microchip, Applied Digital Solutions, NASDAQ ADSX, a West Palm Beach, Florida maker of the implantable Vero chip, coined the term getting chip as part of the marketing campaign that attracted worldwide coverage.
[01:42:58.635 --> 01:43:03.857]  They did it, and their stock plunged from $5 to about, what was it, $0.65 or something.
[01:43:04.317 --> 01:43:05.017]  It's low now.
[01:43:05.057 --> 01:43:06.598]  It's like $1 or something last time I checked.
[01:43:07.341 --> 01:43:11.723]  The VeriChip is an injectable radio frequency identification chip marketed for human use.
[01:43:11.823 --> 01:43:17.865]  It can carry a unique identification number, along with other data, in addition to wirelessly, wireable, available.
[01:43:19.666 --> 01:43:20.286]  And it goes on.
[01:43:20.326 --> 01:43:21.167]  I'm not going to read any more.
[01:43:21.187 --> 01:43:23.708]  It's totally disgusting and evil.
[01:43:24.088 --> 01:43:28.670]  But my cousin last Monday, who runs the whole Hubbard, he does, and he's in logistics.
[01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:30.570]  I can't say too much.
[01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:36.973]  Let's just say he works at the airport in the Army with the APD and the Hubbard drones and the helicopters.
[01:43:37.898 --> 01:43:38.479]  I've got to call him.
[01:43:38.499 --> 01:43:39.239]  I wonder if he's in trouble.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:41.942]  I got hover drone visits yesterday and helicopter visits.
[01:43:42.002 --> 01:43:42.603]  Oh, it's on video.
[01:43:42.743 --> 01:43:44.044]  I'll air some of it tomorrow on TV.
[01:43:44.845 --> 01:43:46.787]  On my TV show I do Wednesday nights here in Austin.
[01:43:49.149 --> 01:43:54.934]  Maybe I've got time to stick it in Police State 3 Total Enslavement before I release that in a few weeks.
[01:43:55.095 --> 01:43:55.475]  I don't know.
[01:43:55.495 --> 01:43:57.997]  I can't handle it anymore.
[01:43:58.318 --> 01:43:59.779]  Got an email here from Kansas City.
[01:43:59.799 --> 01:44:02.482]  The guy says, Yeah, I heard you say...
[01:44:03.833 --> 01:44:11.396]  You got the internal document about how postal workers can't leave if there's a red alert and they'll have to stay for days and can't get their kids.
[01:44:12.476 --> 01:44:19.519]  I was pulling into a post office in Kansas City when you said that, and I walked in and the postal guy at the counter said, yeah, it's true.
[01:44:20.459 --> 01:44:22.760]  Well, folks, you don't have to go ask the postal workers.
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:30.063]  The Gannett News Service had FEMA saying you can't leave your house and you'll, quote, lose all your rights under a red alert.
[01:44:30.143 --> 01:44:31.023]  Martial law.
[01:44:31.753 --> 01:44:33.493]  That's on Infowars.com.
[01:44:34.814 --> 01:44:35.774]  It's all out in the open.
[01:44:35.794 --> 01:44:37.774]  I'm glad you went and asked the postal people.
[01:44:39.474 --> 01:44:40.435]  Because it's true.
[01:44:42.815 --> 01:44:48.076]  Oh, but a lot of people, any way to deny what's happening on this show, they'd rather just hate me.
[01:44:48.116 --> 01:44:52.117]  I'm not saying this person emailed me yet, but they'd rather just hate me than face the facts.
[01:44:52.177 --> 01:44:53.337]  I know the facts are scary.
[01:44:53.937 --> 01:44:55.897]  But just because you deny it doesn't mean it's not there.
[01:44:55.917 --> 01:44:59.638]  You know, they're telling the troops they're all about to get their chips.
[01:45:00.373 --> 01:45:01.794]  I mean, it's getting serious, folks.
[01:45:01.814 --> 01:45:02.494]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:05.275 --> 01:45:12.678]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:45:12.938 --> 01:45:17.680]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:45:17.901 --> 01:45:23.543]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:45:23.783 --> 01:45:28.305]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:45:28.526 --> 01:45:35.689]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:40.232]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:45:40.412 --> 01:45:42.933]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:45:43.133 --> 01:45:49.857]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:51.198]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:51.218 --> 01:45:51.459]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:46:05.453 --> 01:46:09.938]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:46:10.278 --> 01:46:14.382]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:46:14.662 --> 01:46:15.223]  We listened.
[01:46:15.523 --> 01:46:20.508]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:46:20.788 --> 01:46:21.269]  We listened.
[01:46:21.649 --> 01:46:24.692]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:46:25.133 --> 01:46:25.653]  We listened.
[01:46:26.134 --> 01:46:29.477]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:31.672]  We're good to go.
[01:46:55.385 --> 01:46:55.966]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[01:46:56.006 --> 01:46:57.407]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:07.322]  Sharon lost 28 pounds with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:47:07.462 --> 01:47:18.648]  Because I lost 28 pounds and my husband could see the difference in me, I encourage him to start taking Vim and Vigor also because he needs to lose weight and he's already lost 10 pounds and is happy about it.
[01:47:18.748 --> 01:47:27.133]  Not only are Sharon and her husband glad to have lost 28 and 10 pounds with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor, that's weight Sharon didn't think she'd ever lose.
[01:47:27.413 --> 01:47:35.843]  I have a thyroid problem and blood pressure and Vim and Vigor has really been a blessing to me in helping me to lose the pounds I thought I could lose.
[01:47:36.184 --> 01:47:38.587]  I've lost 28 pounds and counting.
[01:47:38.747 --> 01:47:42.511]  That was Sharon's personal experience while taking Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[01:47:42.752 --> 01:47:43.653]  What are you waiting for?
[01:47:43.933 --> 01:47:47.517]  Take charge and lose that unwanted fat with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[01:47:47.637 --> 01:47:49.379]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:47:49.399 --> 01:47:49.600]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:51.222]  And get $25 off a three month supply.
[01:47:51.242 --> 01:47:51.342]  1-800-622-8446.
[01:47:51.422 --> 01:47:51.722]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:48:12.018 --> 01:48:17.321]  All right, my friends.
[01:48:17.361 --> 01:48:22.885]  We're going to open the phones up in the next hour, and I've still only covered 20% of the news.
[01:48:23.505 --> 01:48:25.346]  Frankly, I'm not going to lie.
[01:48:25.366 --> 01:48:25.766]  10%, okay?
[01:48:26.907 --> 01:48:30.889]  And I can never cover it all, but I'm going to try to cover another 20%, another 10%.
[01:48:30.989 --> 01:48:32.030]  I don't know in the next hour.
[01:48:33.291 --> 01:48:35.192]  And take your calls, the 1-800-259-9231.
[01:48:39.978 --> 01:48:42.160]  I remember when I went and made America Destroyed by Design.
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:45.923]  I mean, I read the documents, read the Forest Service announcements.
[01:48:46.263 --> 01:48:55.930]  They were going to shut the parks off to cars, shut down some areas, some of the campsites, then all the areas and all the campsites, and shut off whole areas even to hiking.
[01:48:56.811 --> 01:48:57.652]  I mean, this was official.
[01:48:57.692 --> 01:49:01.635]  And I put it in the film, showed the executive orders, showed the Forest Service admitting it.
[01:49:01.655 --> 01:49:03.316]  They threatened to arrest me for asking.
[01:49:03.336 --> 01:49:04.357]  It's all on tape.
[01:49:05.268 --> 01:49:07.830]  And I've probably gotten hundreds of emails and letters over the years.
[01:49:07.871 --> 01:49:08.651]  That's crazy.
[01:49:08.691 --> 01:49:09.892]  They won't shut down the parks.
[01:49:11.474 --> 01:49:13.896]  I was digging through news I never covered this morning.
[01:49:14.697 --> 01:49:18.220]  Last Monday, a couple of mainstream news articles, they're going to shut down a couple of big parks.
[01:49:19.061 --> 01:49:22.144]  You'll have to stop at the entrance and get on a bus and go in.
[01:49:22.164 --> 01:49:23.405]  They're shutting down campsites.
[01:49:23.425 --> 01:49:24.446]  You can't stay in them.
[01:49:24.466 --> 01:49:25.547]  You can't do anything.
[01:49:26.107 --> 01:49:27.549]  Just letting you know who the boss is.
[01:49:28.970 --> 01:49:29.851]  I got that article.
[01:49:30.879 --> 01:49:32.860]  I got this insane corruption article.
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:34.080]  It's nuts.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.260]  It's all crazy.
[01:49:37.821 --> 01:49:39.241]  It's totally insane.
[01:49:39.801 --> 01:49:40.801]  And here it is.
[01:49:40.881 --> 01:49:45.123]  Forced busing in national parks decried as anti-people, CNS News.
[01:49:46.543 --> 01:49:51.284]  And it goes on to say they're forcing visitors out of their cars into big buses.
[01:49:52.304 --> 01:49:54.965]  And it says they're shutting down the campsites.
[01:49:56.308 --> 01:50:01.512]  It says that it's Yosemite, Grand Canyon, a bunch of places.
[01:50:01.572 --> 01:50:05.855]  Yellowstone says the Park Service is engaging in social engineering at Yellowstone.
[01:50:06.235 --> 01:50:08.357]  It's trying to do the same thing at other national parks.
[01:50:08.737 --> 01:50:13.581]  Fishman warned, forced busing will not work in Los Angeles or Boston schools, and it won't work in the national parks.
[01:50:14.621 --> 01:50:16.663]  And it says Bush won't kill the plan.
[01:50:17.618 --> 01:50:19.139]  And of course they won't.
[01:50:19.499 --> 01:50:22.540]  The guy on your scale, the guy's a communist.
[01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:30.322]  He isn't really a communist, but in this whole left-right bony paradigm, he's closer to Mao Zedong than he is to George Washington.
[01:50:30.702 --> 01:50:32.103]  I'll just put it that way.
[01:50:32.123 --> 01:50:35.284]  I mean, you know, look at the policies, not the rhetoric.
[01:50:37.074 --> 01:50:42.920]  And it says the green groups are engaging in pagan worship of trees and they are willing to sacrifice people in the preservation process.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:48.785]  Cushman said, the head of the American Land Rights Association.
[01:50:48.805 --> 01:50:49.886]  That's a big group, folks.
[01:50:51.268 --> 01:50:54.951]  And it says here the pagan groups want the parks totally shut down.
[01:50:54.971 --> 01:50:57.513]  Yeah, that's what it's about.
[01:50:57.954 --> 01:50:59.976]  And it says, list...
[01:51:00.718 --> 01:51:01.498]  Other people here.
[01:51:02.959 --> 01:51:07.120]  Look, the news is so insane now, there's no way to even cover it.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:08.680]  That's the problem.
[01:51:10.381 --> 01:51:13.422]  Another one here, man charged with crime for protecting his sheep.
[01:51:13.482 --> 01:51:20.303]  Mountain lion was publicly eating them, and one of his employees saw it gobbling sheep and shot it, which you're actually allowed to do.
[01:51:20.463 --> 01:51:23.404]  The cougars are way up in the population numbers now.
[01:51:23.744 --> 01:51:28.786]  Folks, I even saw one run real quick in the woods in East Texas when I was deer hunting about four years ago.
[01:51:28.806 --> 01:51:29.746]  I mean, they're back.
[01:51:30.578 --> 01:51:31.099]  Big time.
[01:51:31.139 --> 01:51:31.939]  They were always there.
[01:51:31.959 --> 01:51:34.642]  A bunch of other news.
[01:51:34.682 --> 01:51:39.085]  There's an article here out of the Baltimore Sun on our Wellian Purge.
[01:51:41.007 --> 01:51:50.355]  And it says that the government now is purging libraries of large portions of their print and computer systems of stuff.
[01:51:50.395 --> 01:51:56.680]  I told you they're throwing away all the old Patriot books, the old dictionaries, the old encyclopedias that had different definitions.
[01:51:58.721 --> 01:52:01.283]  By the way, the schools are taking 1984 out.
[01:52:01.963 --> 01:52:02.604]  Did you know that?
[01:52:03.424 --> 01:52:10.528]  Yeah, one of the greatest class cases of contemporary literature in George Orwell's 84, a novel routinely taught in English classes in the country.
[01:52:11.068 --> 01:52:20.113]  It goes on to say, many readers are riveted by 84 and Orwell's terrifying vision of a totalitarian society ruled by Big Brother and dominated by control of all citizens' reading material, actions, and even thoughts.
[01:52:21.044 --> 01:52:25.307]  And it goes on to say, double speak, saying one thing and meaning another, dominates in 1984.
[01:52:25.927 --> 01:52:28.289]  Well, this writer doesn't understand what double speak is.
[01:52:28.489 --> 01:52:30.050]  Freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength.
[01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:44.259]  No, double think is being able to say, when I say New World Order is bad, you go, there is no New World Order, and then five minutes later, Walter Cronkite announces New World Order on that PBS special last week, and you go, yes, it's good, it's real.
[01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:46.341]  That's double speak and double think.
[01:52:46.881 --> 01:52:48.062]  It's being mentally ill.
[01:52:48.282 --> 01:52:51.585]  The whole population, mentally ill, grueling morons.
[01:52:51.745 --> 01:52:52.445]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:54.086 --> 01:52:57.609]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:52:57.829 --> 01:53:01.331]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:53:01.411 --> 01:53:11.879]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.451 --> 01:53:20.092]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.752 --> 01:53:21.832]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.532 --> 01:53:23.633]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.293 --> 01:53:25.093]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.853 --> 01:53:26.753]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.773 --> 01:53:31.235]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.615 --> 01:53:35.736]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.196 --> 01:53:38.276]  I love liberty.
[01:53:39.237 --> 01:53:39.897]  I love liberty.
[01:53:40.277 --> 01:53:40.977]  I love freedom.
[01:53:41.957 --> 01:53:44.138]  I love our constitutional republic.
[01:53:45.106 --> 01:53:48.308]  I will defend it against enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:53:48.688 --> 01:53:50.569]  Well, I did cover a lot of news in the last hour.
[01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:51.870]  Did a pretty good job there.
[01:53:54.392 --> 01:53:56.453]  And I haven't even scratched the surface, to be frank with you.
[01:53:56.973 --> 01:53:58.774]  It's all coming up in this hour.
[01:54:00.075 --> 01:54:01.296]  And we're going to take calls now.
[01:54:01.476 --> 01:54:03.597]  In fact, I want to come back in the next segment and take a lot of calls.
[01:54:03.677 --> 01:54:04.858]  I do want to take a lot of calls this hour.
[01:54:04.878 --> 01:54:06.339]  We will go to them quickly in the next segment.
[01:54:06.914 --> 01:54:08.254]  We've got some open lines, too.
[01:54:08.274 --> 01:54:15.656]  The toll-free number to join me on air is, on this live Tuesday edition, the 29th of April, 2003, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:15.696 --> 01:54:15.936]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:15.956 --> 01:54:17.637]  And let's say you disagree with me.
[01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:38.372]  Let's say there's still a liberal left out there listening to this show, or a conservative.
[01:54:39.355 --> 01:54:41.257]  Have you realized you're all on the same team?
[01:54:41.277 --> 01:54:49.784]  You're all in a false political paradigm discussing a theatrical production put onto you by psychological warfare captains of death and doom.
[01:54:50.404 --> 01:54:50.905]  Literally.
[01:54:51.285 --> 01:54:56.429]  Slavery and stinking rotten flesh incorporated is what the New World Order is.
[01:54:56.930 --> 01:54:59.792]  It's what they're all about, and it's what they're doing.
[01:55:00.232 --> 01:55:07.318]  The globalists are the most sadistic, controlling, conniving, desperately wicked people ever to...
[01:55:08.439 --> 01:55:10.042]  Stench the face of the earth.
[01:55:10.142 --> 01:55:11.445]  They are the four horsemen.
[01:55:11.885 --> 01:55:13.829]  They are dehumanization.
[01:55:14.490 --> 01:55:21.743]  They are so evil that you will be so mind-controlled that you will beg them as they crush you and as they mind you.
[01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:23.661]  Annihilate you.
[01:55:23.961 --> 01:55:44.495]  You won't beg them for more slavery unless you wake up to the reality of the insanity rushing past us, the liquidation of our institutions, liberty being removed and in its place the dark idols of slavery and tyranny and despotism and serfdom and feudalism.
[01:55:46.164 --> 01:55:48.726]  I beg you, folks, investigate the real world.
[01:55:48.826 --> 01:55:50.788]  Make it your life to fight the New World Order.
[01:55:50.868 --> 01:55:53.570]  Just look at the crimes committed by these people.
[01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:56.472]  Aren't you sick of them not being brought to justice?
[01:55:56.853 --> 01:55:59.595]  Doesn't your soul cry out to resist them?
[01:56:00.135 --> 01:56:02.938]  If it doesn't, something's wrong with you.
[01:56:03.038 --> 01:56:04.639]  Something's wrong inside.
[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:06.961]  And I pity you.
[01:56:07.501 --> 01:56:08.002]  All right.
[01:56:08.022 --> 01:56:09.703]  We've got a bunch of news coming up.
[01:56:10.744 --> 01:56:11.865]  Well, there's already been a bunch of...
[01:56:12.742 --> 01:56:13.523]  Crazy news.
[01:56:13.543 --> 01:56:17.325]  We're having to admit that yet another fake site of chemical weapons.
[01:56:18.025 --> 01:56:19.406]  Turns out it was rocket fuel.
[01:56:19.446 --> 01:56:24.529]  They found bug spray several hundred times, 50 plus times they put out false reports.
[01:56:25.590 --> 01:56:31.654]  And now they are basically shutting the country down.
[01:56:31.674 --> 01:56:35.036]  A Miami journalist has gotten chipped, telling everyone they need to get microchips.
[01:56:35.056 --> 01:56:36.577]  They're out promoting that as usual.
[01:56:36.617 --> 01:56:39.979]  The Communist Chinese, IBM-owned Applied Digital Solutions.
[01:56:41.184 --> 01:56:45.709]  And we're going to be getting into trade accord, become a U.S.
[01:56:45.749 --> 01:56:47.110]  foreign policy tool.
[01:56:48.011 --> 01:56:49.373]  Those are being de-industrialized.
[01:56:49.413 --> 01:56:50.834]  They want to expand Afton Gat.
[01:56:50.874 --> 01:56:51.795]  It's been good for the economy, huh?
[01:56:51.875 --> 01:56:53.136]  All your jobs are leaving forever.
[01:56:53.176 --> 01:56:53.957]  Hey, let's have more.
[01:56:54.918 --> 01:56:56.340]  Also, anger mounts after U.S.
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.921]  troops killed 13 Iraqis.
[01:56:57.941 --> 01:57:01.745]  There's photos of them machine-gunning small children, shooting people in the back.
[01:57:02.086 --> 01:57:04.248]  Children's bodies melted all over roadways.
[01:57:05.197 --> 01:57:06.718]  You're not supposed to see those images.
[01:57:07.278 --> 01:57:09.779]  Blair warns France of cold war with the U.S.
[01:57:09.959 --> 01:57:12.200]  Now they're going to have this fake fight with the EU.
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.200]  As I told you years ago, they would.
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:15.221]  I'll analyze that.
[01:57:15.241 --> 01:57:16.681]  This is how they do it.
[01:57:16.701 --> 01:57:17.562]  Get the job done.
[01:57:18.942 --> 01:57:23.124]  Also, forces chief question war legality.
[01:57:24.082 --> 01:57:27.945]  Admiral Sir Michael Boyce is saying that it was totally illegal and was a fraud.
[01:57:27.965 --> 01:57:30.266]  Of course, he's only trying to empower the U.N.
[01:57:30.686 --> 01:57:34.669]  And for that, other British ministers, they're talking about war crimes.
[01:57:35.209 --> 01:57:38.571]  We're saying don't follow illegal orders to kill civilians.
[01:57:38.591 --> 01:57:40.793]  They're going after them over there.
[01:57:42.214 --> 01:57:42.754]  They want that.
[01:57:43.454 --> 01:57:46.756]  Blair fears new Cold War over EU rift with U.S.
[01:57:46.796 --> 01:57:49.798]  Another story about the headline, the New World Order.
[01:57:49.818 --> 01:57:50.619]  Wait till you hear about this.
[01:57:51.539 --> 01:57:54.640]  4,000 quarantined in Beijing as SARS cases climb.
[01:57:55.001 --> 01:57:57.442]  Both Korea and in the cookie jar.
[01:57:57.462 --> 01:58:00.223]  What did you hear about that with the nukes that were given to them by Rumsfeld?
[01:58:00.763 --> 01:58:02.624]  Police check drivers around Beijing.
[01:58:03.164 --> 01:58:06.486]  Our police are giving new powers for random checkpoints nationwide.
[01:58:07.346 --> 01:58:09.447]  And it has nothing to do with stopping terrorists.
[01:58:09.908 --> 01:58:10.728]  It's all coming up.
[01:58:10.748 --> 01:58:11.688]  But first, your calls.
[01:58:11.908 --> 01:58:12.789]  Stay with us, please.
[01:58:14.855 --> 01:58:21.662]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:58:22.023 --> 01:58:23.364]  That's right folks, DVD.

[01:58:25.947 --> 01:58:28.029]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:58:28.309 --> 01:58:33.234]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:58:33.575 --> 01:58:37.599]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:22.420]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:31.687 --> 02:01:35.370]  All right, welcome back, my friends.
[02:01:35.791 --> 02:01:38.693]  I'm rabidly anti-New World Order.
[02:01:39.133 --> 02:01:40.514]  I don't like what they're doing.
[02:01:40.534 --> 02:01:43.777]  You could say I hate what they're doing, but I do what I do because I love my family.
[02:01:46.379 --> 02:01:58.728]  And when one has investigated, this is a key point, when one has investigated the crimes of the New World Order over and over again and seen the most horrible things imaginable,
[02:01:59.306 --> 02:02:11.814]  Things that you can't even describe on gigantic scales, so evil that if you wrote it in some thousand-page nightmare science fiction novel, people wouldn't be able to suspend disbelief and, you know, get into the book.
[02:02:12.975 --> 02:02:15.397]  But it's real, it's proven, it's out in the open.
[02:02:16.157 --> 02:02:17.939]  You know, I use this example a lot because it's simple.
[02:02:18.499 --> 02:02:19.920]  Texas company ProteGene.
[02:02:21.121 --> 02:02:29.910]  It's authorization, 96 locations, to plant pharmacological corn that grows HIV virus, hepatitis B virus, pig virus, chemicals.
[02:02:30.871 --> 02:02:33.193]  It spreads into soybeans, ends up in grain.
[02:02:33.493 --> 02:02:34.594]  We don't know where it went.
[02:02:34.735 --> 02:02:36.336]  Government has to burn a bunch of fields.
[02:02:36.757 --> 02:02:38.278]  The government gives them a slap on the wrist.
[02:02:39.579 --> 02:02:43.023]  Open air, plants with AIDS virus and hepatitis.
[02:02:44.068 --> 02:02:46.451]  You know, folks, that's just one company doing one crazy thing.
[02:02:46.872 --> 02:02:49.455]  Goats that are half spider in upstate New York.
[02:02:49.535 --> 02:02:50.616]  I have the CEO on.
[02:02:50.637 --> 02:02:51.998]  Yeah, we're out here at the military base.
[02:02:52.299 --> 02:02:54.802]  Over a thousand spider goats producing body armor.
[02:02:55.122 --> 02:02:56.304]  It's crazy!
[02:02:57.345 --> 02:03:00.229]  And the average person doesn't even know about this.
[02:03:02.328 --> 02:03:06.270]  It's admitted that they've got cockroach genes in tomatoes and salmon genes in corn.
[02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:08.330]  What type of weird spinoff is going to come from this?
[02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:09.811]  Some deadly virus and kill us all.
[02:03:10.131 --> 02:03:11.111]  That's how it happens.
[02:03:11.131 --> 02:03:13.012]  That's how mutations happen.
[02:03:13.192 --> 02:03:16.914]  You put pigs and geese next to each other in China.
[02:03:17.194 --> 02:03:21.395]  Too many animals in too close an area and the disease pathogen level rises.
[02:03:21.756 --> 02:03:22.796]  Viruses mutate.
[02:03:22.816 --> 02:03:24.417]  You get the influenza outbreak of 1915.
[02:03:24.457 --> 02:03:27.778]  Or 1923 that killed conservatively 80 million people.
[02:03:31.710 --> 02:03:35.051]  They're doing stuff a million times more insane just randomly doing it.
[02:03:35.652 --> 02:03:36.632]  They can care less.
[02:03:37.152 --> 02:03:38.213]  It's totally nuts.
[02:03:39.593 --> 02:03:42.614]  And that's just one small corner of the craziness going on.
[02:03:42.634 --> 02:03:45.856]  And then you read what the biotech companies say.
[02:03:45.896 --> 02:03:58.381]  They go, well, the CEO a few years ago, he said, well, yeah, we're going to engineer almost every major crop and even seed, grass, tree, herb, and then we're going to own everything.
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:04.044]  And we're going to infect the entire biosphere until we own patents on all of it.
[02:04:04.344 --> 02:04:12.610]  So they create plants, they plant it in growth belts, the pollen gets into all the other similar species, then they come sue you and claim ownership of it when they attacked you.
[02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:17.234]  And the courts have ruled, yeah, yeah, when they contaminate you, they come sue you.
[02:04:17.254 --> 02:04:24.119]  And they're already taking people's land, everything, they can prove they bought their seed from somebody else, didn't buy the genetically engineered, didn't want it.
[02:04:24.419 --> 02:04:25.560]  They find one plant out of 100,000.
[02:04:27.595 --> 02:04:29.118]  Stocks, it's over for you.
[02:04:29.218 --> 02:04:30.199]  They take your land.
[02:04:30.279 --> 02:04:31.261]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:04:31.321 --> 02:04:32.443]  It's sick, folks.
[02:04:33.224 --> 02:04:38.252]  That's 1% on one subject we can talk on for 10 days.
[02:04:38.633 --> 02:04:39.434]  Just mentioning it.
[02:04:40.962 --> 02:04:52.928]  I mean, these people are in narcotics trafficking, child kidnapping, government extortion rackets, the crimes, genetic engineering on us, biological chemical testing on us, toxic waste dumping.
[02:04:53.549 --> 02:04:58.451]  They do it in big official ways, and then somebody dumps a motor on their backyard and gets five years in prison.
[02:04:59.072 --> 02:05:00.232]  It's insane, folks.
[02:05:02.774 --> 02:05:03.494]  Come on.
[02:05:03.554 --> 02:05:04.575]  This is out of control.
[02:05:04.675 --> 02:05:05.735]  Tara in Kentucky.
[02:05:05.775 --> 02:05:06.716]  Tara, good to talk to you.
[02:05:06.736 --> 02:05:07.036]  Welcome.
[02:05:08.903 --> 02:05:09.324]  You bet.
[02:05:10.085 --> 02:05:11.046]  I just had a quick question.
[02:05:11.066 --> 02:05:27.343]  I hate to have you reiterate on something you've already touched upon, but I'm a postal worker here, a letter carrier, and I heard you mentioning something about the alert status and us not being able to leave, and I'm not sure what that pertains to.
[02:05:27.363 --> 02:05:29.665]  I don't know about... You're in Kentucky, right?
[02:05:29.785 --> 02:05:30.286]  Right.
[02:05:31.859 --> 02:05:36.642]  I don't know about your area of Kentucky, but I got a letter faxed to me from Kansas City.
[02:05:37.622 --> 02:05:38.863]  Official letterhead.
[02:05:39.203 --> 02:05:43.946]  First the listener called and he said, we were told there was a red alert, we can't leave.
[02:05:43.966 --> 02:05:46.468]  We're going to have armed guards here.
[02:05:46.548 --> 02:05:48.949]  Any type of terrorist alert, red alert, we can't leave.
[02:05:49.410 --> 02:05:52.472]  We can't pick our kids up and it could be Dave's have changes of clothes and food.
[02:05:54.033 --> 02:05:56.234]  And he said, most people said, no, we're going to get our kids.
[02:05:57.015 --> 02:05:58.916]  I said, sir, will you fax me that letter?
[02:06:00.097 --> 02:06:00.457]  He did.
[02:06:01.569 --> 02:06:07.293]  This all came about because of the Washington Post saying that in D.C., you won't be allowed to pick your children up.
[02:06:07.333 --> 02:06:08.553]  By the way, we're on the radio in D.C.
[02:06:09.094 --> 02:06:12.296]  You'll be allowed to pick your children up if there's a red alert.
[02:06:12.336 --> 02:06:13.516]  That was the Washington Post.
[02:06:14.117 --> 02:06:16.238]  And that's in my press release on Infowars.com.
[02:06:16.258 --> 02:06:17.999]  You can click through the hyperlink and read all these articles.
[02:06:18.679 --> 02:06:22.401]  Then we found out that other... I mean, I've been sent conservatively 200 faxes...
[02:06:24.557 --> 02:06:36.029]  Hundreds of scanned letters from schools from California to Pennsylvania to Boston, Massachusetts, I mean everywhere, Florida, Texas, where they're telling the parents, red alert, you can't pick your kids up, they'll be taken to an undisclosed location.
[02:06:37.133 --> 02:06:37.914]  I thought it was quite ironic.
[02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:10.672]  I mean, my son's school is maybe a mile or two from my route, and I thought, to hell with everybody else.
[02:07:10.812 --> 02:07:13.793]  The first place I would be would be, you know, going to him.
[02:07:13.813 --> 02:07:15.214]  Well, ask your school.
[02:07:15.234 --> 02:07:16.754]  They'll probably say, no, they're going to lock down.
[02:07:16.774 --> 02:07:17.494]  You can't have your kid.
[02:07:17.534 --> 02:07:18.055]  May bus them.
[02:07:18.435 --> 02:07:20.956]  They've had drills with Army buses, FEMA buses.
[02:07:21.696 --> 02:07:23.456]  I have mainstream news articles on this.
[02:07:23.516 --> 02:07:26.377]  In a film I made in 2000, The Takeover.
[02:07:26.938 --> 02:07:32.760]  The Takeover has an AP article saying FEMA planned this long before all the terror.
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:33.580]  Right.
[02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:35.581]  This is all scripted.
[02:07:36.181 --> 02:07:39.044]  Have you asked them about this there in your area?
[02:07:39.724 --> 02:07:40.005]  No.
[02:07:40.185 --> 02:07:43.047]  Actually, this is the first that I have heard about it.
[02:07:43.488 --> 02:07:46.730]  We've gone over many scenarios.
[02:07:46.770 --> 02:07:53.656]  We've had our stand-up talks from our management concerning Target Mail, just looking out for things.
[02:07:53.796 --> 02:07:57.780]  But never have we discussed anything like that.
[02:07:57.900 --> 02:07:58.941]  Now, under TIPS,
[02:07:59.893 --> 02:08:03.136]  I know, from what I've heard, the Postal Service declined to get involved in that spying that
[02:08:23.894 --> 02:08:26.516]  President Bush and his party were trying to set up.
[02:08:26.536 --> 02:08:28.256]  Yeah, they were told to, and they said, we don't want to.
[02:08:28.276 --> 02:08:28.777]  Right.
[02:08:28.837 --> 02:08:38.442]  We did not feel, I mean, not me personally, but I guess, you know, the upper echelon and the Postal Service did not feel that that was something that they wanted to be responsible for.
[02:08:38.462 --> 02:08:39.343]  Well, I'll tell you what happened.
[02:08:39.363 --> 02:08:39.803]  This happened.
[02:08:40.655 --> 02:08:42.256]  Don't let them know the big secret.
[02:08:43.197 --> 02:08:44.017]  But here's the good news.
[02:08:44.057 --> 02:08:45.618]  I mean, there's how many letters a week?
[02:08:45.638 --> 02:08:46.799]  I mean, hundreds of millions, right?
[02:08:47.139 --> 02:08:47.860]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:49.901]  I mean, it's in the billions monthly, right?
[02:08:50.081 --> 02:08:50.481]  Right.
[02:08:50.662 --> 02:08:51.342]  Or more than that.
[02:08:51.622 --> 02:08:51.982]  Right.
[02:08:52.082 --> 02:08:53.804]  All the junk mail has got to be in the trillions.
[02:08:54.104 --> 02:08:54.484]  Oh, yeah.
[02:08:54.804 --> 02:08:55.204]  Aggregate.
[02:08:55.244 --> 02:09:04.751]  But look, they can't spy on you is the point unless they go to the digital stamp, which they want to make people do.
[02:09:04.791 --> 02:09:05.251]  Don't do it.
[02:09:05.271 --> 02:09:06.332]  Right.
[02:09:06.352 --> 02:09:06.652]  Right.
[02:09:07.392 --> 02:09:11.075]  You know, where you've got to go to a central location or buy a little meter and you scan the thing on.
[02:09:11.496 --> 02:09:12.356]  It's got your code.
[02:09:12.416 --> 02:09:13.437]  Folks, stay away from that.
[02:09:14.118 --> 02:09:19.342]  You're talking about from, like, the postal that you purchased and print off your computer?
[02:09:19.602 --> 02:09:19.923]  Yes.
[02:09:20.683 --> 02:09:21.124]  Okay.
[02:09:21.964 --> 02:09:23.886]  If it's the type that, you know, puts the stamp on?
[02:09:24.186 --> 02:09:25.267]  With the barcode, yes.
[02:09:25.287 --> 02:09:26.448]  Yeah, you don't want that.
[02:09:27.149 --> 02:09:27.549]  Right.
[02:09:27.869 --> 02:09:31.752]  But, yeah, it's just really, you know, I'm just so glad I found your site.
[02:09:31.793 --> 02:09:34.635]  A friend referred me to your site, and it's been just,
[02:09:35.276 --> 02:09:38.157]  Very enlightening, because it is something I'm very concerned about.
[02:09:39.357 --> 02:09:40.678]  Are you listening on the Internet, then?
[02:09:41.118 --> 02:09:41.378]  Yes.
[02:09:42.198 --> 02:09:43.439]  Well, please spread the word.
[02:09:43.539 --> 02:09:44.199]  Pass it on.
[02:09:44.259 --> 02:09:44.979]  Pay it forward.
[02:09:45.099 --> 02:09:52.942]  And I hope that folks in Kentucky who are listening on shortwave Internet satellite, call your local AM and FM stations and tell them, we want the Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:53.402 --> 02:09:53.682]  Right, yes.
[02:09:53.762 --> 02:09:55.283]  That's how we get most of our affiliates.
[02:09:55.922 --> 02:09:56.822]  Yes, that would be great.
[02:09:56.842 --> 02:10:00.163]  That way I wouldn't have to, you know, when I leave home, I can't continue listening to you.
[02:10:00.223 --> 02:10:02.263]  I can only listen to you briefly when I'm eating lunch.
[02:10:02.343 --> 02:10:03.244]  And don't waste your time.
[02:10:03.284 --> 02:10:06.944]  Don't call Clear Channel or any big establishment conglomerate.
[02:10:07.265 --> 02:10:09.945]  Call a mom and pop or a smaller group of stations.
[02:10:10.365 --> 02:10:11.746]  And a lot of them are picking us up.
[02:10:11.786 --> 02:10:12.446]  It's very exciting.
[02:10:12.866 --> 02:10:13.206]  Right.
[02:10:13.646 --> 02:10:14.506]  Thank you for the call.
[02:10:14.846 --> 02:10:16.187]  I certainly appreciate your help.
[02:10:16.427 --> 02:10:17.667]  Tara, I appreciate you.
[02:10:18.047 --> 02:10:19.527]  And ask your post office.
[02:10:19.887 --> 02:10:20.788]  See what they say.
[02:10:20.888 --> 02:10:22.408]  And then call me back.
[02:10:24.211 --> 02:10:24.912]  Thanks for the call.
[02:10:26.013 --> 02:10:28.254]  Go talk to your postmaster and see what's going on in Kentucky.
[02:10:28.675 --> 02:10:32.838]  We know what's going on in Austin and Kansas City, so in Texas and in Missouri.
[02:10:33.919 --> 02:10:36.380]  I know what's going on with the kids, I mean everywhere.
[02:10:36.761 --> 02:10:37.581]  It's incredible.
[02:10:38.302 --> 02:10:43.346]  The response I got when I gave my fax number out, we're still getting school letters faxed to us.
[02:10:44.366 --> 02:10:51.532]  There's a stack in my other office upstairs that is two inches thick of one- and two-page faxes
[02:10:52.465 --> 02:10:53.126]  From the schools.
[02:10:53.186 --> 02:10:54.347]  And then they always have the website.
[02:10:54.367 --> 02:10:55.387]  I go to the website and get it.
[02:10:55.808 --> 02:10:56.268]  Of the school.
[02:10:56.288 --> 02:10:57.409]  Where you can't get your kids.
[02:10:57.429 --> 02:10:58.790]  They'll be bused to FEMA centers.
[02:10:59.070 --> 02:10:59.470]  The U.S.
[02:10:59.570 --> 02:11:01.231]  Army decided to help.
[02:11:01.892 --> 02:11:05.194]  By the way, there's a forced inoculation program with the Army in some of them.
[02:11:05.935 --> 02:11:06.675]  Really sick.
[02:11:06.835 --> 02:11:07.516]  Thank you, Tara.
[02:11:08.456 --> 02:11:09.657]  John in Indiana.
[02:11:09.677 --> 02:11:10.618]  And then John in Texas.
[02:11:10.658 --> 02:11:11.378]  John, you're on the air.
[02:11:11.398 --> 02:11:11.759]  Go ahead.
[02:11:12.079 --> 02:11:12.699]  Well, thank you.
[02:11:12.719 --> 02:11:14.901]  I wanted to thank you for your wonderful program.
[02:11:15.001 --> 02:11:18.663]  I listen every day, as do thousands of people in our area.
[02:11:18.804 --> 02:11:20.485]  And it's the only true...
[02:11:21.209 --> 02:11:22.050]  News that we get.
[02:11:22.070 --> 02:11:24.451]  I really appreciate the job that you're doing.
[02:11:25.192 --> 02:11:29.334]  What I was calling about was the state and federal parks.
[02:11:30.055 --> 02:11:35.058]  There are a lot of people, especially during the summer, that park extent times they have the large RVs.
[02:11:35.598 --> 02:11:41.602]  If they do have one of these Code Reds, are they going to lock the people who are already camped inside, or are they going to force them out?
[02:11:42.362 --> 02:11:46.705]  I don't know what they'll do under a Code Red, but they have said that... They didn't say it was an option.
[02:11:46.725 --> 02:11:48.266]  They said, we will lock down all the cities.
[02:11:48.306 --> 02:11:49.387]  You can't have your kids...
[02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:51.001]  It may be regional.
[02:11:51.021 --> 02:11:51.902]  It may be national.
[02:11:51.942 --> 02:11:53.563]  But from what they're saying, it's national.
[02:11:53.783 --> 02:11:55.624]  I don't think they'll do that at first.
[02:11:55.664 --> 02:11:58.927]  They'll lock down a city for a few hours and go, okay, everything's all right.
[02:11:58.987 --> 02:12:00.568]  Next time, a half a day.
[02:12:00.628 --> 02:12:01.809]  Next time, two days.
[02:12:02.189 --> 02:12:03.010]  Next time, a week.
[02:12:03.550 --> 02:12:10.796]  Just training us when the highway FEMA billboards under Amber Alerts, really FEMA EAS, martial law, running man system, literally.
[02:12:10.876 --> 02:12:11.457]  I work in radio.
[02:12:11.477 --> 02:12:14.339]  There's FEMA box in all the radio stations, TV stations.
[02:12:15.059 --> 02:12:16.120]  Sounds like a free country, doesn't it?
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:17.080]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:19.202]  The border stays wide open, John.
[02:12:19.222 --> 02:12:19.502]  Yes, it does.
[02:12:42.722 --> 02:12:43.943]  Anything else you want to add there?
[02:12:44.643 --> 02:12:58.052]  Just as you leave Chicago and come into Indiana on any one of highways 80, 94, 294, I-65, there's the most astonishing array of cameras watching you from every angle all the time.
[02:12:58.613 --> 02:13:00.074]  Well, sir, stay there, stay there.
[02:13:00.434 --> 02:13:01.855]  But I'm sure you heard Indiana.
[02:13:02.435 --> 02:13:04.477]  They were the first state to admit what every state has.
[02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:06.998]  License plate scanning cameras.
[02:13:08.039 --> 02:13:11.041]  Scan 1,000 license plates in seconds.
[02:13:11.974 --> 02:13:13.994]  We'll be right back with our guest, Minnie Hennig.

[02:13:57.865 --> 02:14:02.669]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.

[02:15:14.113 --> 02:15:15.714]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:15:16.094 --> 02:15:21.836]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:15:22.096 --> 02:15:27.218]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:15:27.558 --> 02:15:36.822]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:15:37.202 --> 02:15:37.723]  We're good to go.
[02:15:59.121 --> 02:15:59.161]  888-803-4438.
[02:15:59.181 --> 02:16:00.102]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:16:14.245 --> 02:16:19.486]  It's here, and Ted Anderson from Midas Resources wants to be sure you call right now and get yours today.
[02:16:19.887 --> 02:16:22.347]  It's the 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values.

[02:16:28.889 --> 02:16:34.470]  Armed with the 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values makes you more knowledgeable and makes gun collecting more profitable.

[02:16:45.776 --> 02:16:50.500]  The 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values contains nearly 1 million words of text.
[02:16:50.820 --> 02:16:56.005]  No other book even comes close, and most of the information in this publication is not available anywhere else.

[02:17:04.548 --> 02:17:04.888]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:17:04.948 --> 02:17:05.849]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:17:05.929 --> 02:17:07.389]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:28.923 --> 02:17:30.404]  Yeah, nobody asked you.
[02:17:31.285 --> 02:17:34.227]  You know, these cameras just showed up right before 9-1-1.
[02:17:35.667 --> 02:17:38.269]  They had all these face scanning ones in a warehouse here in Austin.
[02:17:38.309 --> 02:17:41.831]  They put up like two weeks after 9-1-1 and said, oh, it's for 9-1-1.
[02:17:43.413 --> 02:17:51.638]  And I remember last year, Indiana goes, oh, all over the state and going out of the state, we put up scanners that scan your license plate.
[02:17:53.119 --> 02:17:54.760]  Oh, and by the way, we did it two years ago.
[02:17:56.465 --> 02:17:57.307]  So, they already do that.
[02:17:57.327 --> 02:17:58.409]  They can recognize the numbers.
[02:17:58.449 --> 02:18:01.476]  Some license plates have a barcode built in and that reflective cover.
[02:18:02.819 --> 02:18:04.242]  You're totally surveilled, folks!
[02:18:06.158 --> 02:18:12.744]  And it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse, and no one ever asked you, no one ever talked to you, no one ever heard about it.
[02:18:13.444 --> 02:18:14.686]  Go ahead, John Indiana.
[02:18:14.746 --> 02:18:19.270]  Does this make you angry, and is this what you were about to get at, talking about the arrays of cameras?
[02:18:19.290 --> 02:18:19.710]  Go ahead.
[02:18:20.010 --> 02:18:20.290]  Yes.
[02:18:20.671 --> 02:18:29.258]  In fact, in the county contiguous to Chicago, that is in Indiana, you're never off three or four cameras constantly.
[02:18:29.498 --> 02:18:31.160]  It's an astonishing array.
[02:18:32.185 --> 02:18:35.267]  In some of the more rural counties, you don't see that.
[02:18:35.327 --> 02:18:39.769]  But it's almost impossible in Indiana not to be in direct line of sight of a tower.
[02:18:40.390 --> 02:18:43.972]  And as you get close to Chicago, three or four cameras simultaneously.
[02:18:44.192 --> 02:18:45.933]  Well, it's all part of living in a free country.
[02:18:46.373 --> 02:18:50.255]  Torture, military on the streets, hover drones, cameras.
[02:18:50.735 --> 02:18:53.657]  It's not John Carpenter's They Live nightmare horror movie.
[02:18:53.937 --> 02:18:55.258]  It's the free nation.
[02:18:56.298 --> 02:19:00.921]  The cameras are also backed up by solar power and gas.
[02:19:01.901 --> 02:19:12.989]  Well, of course, they're all wired into the state and local FEMA command bunkers that got built in 99.
[02:19:14.490 --> 02:19:15.470]  It's all part of freedom.
[02:19:15.931 --> 02:19:23.135]  Imagine the horrors they've got planned for us as they create massive crises to totally engineer us into maximum slavery.
[02:19:23.155 --> 02:19:23.736]  What do you think of that?
[02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:33.239]  Well, the local paper just announced that the old Gary Airport, which has expanded significantly in size, will be the concentration area.
[02:19:33.679 --> 02:19:36.302]  And they've rerouted one of the old railroad spurs.
[02:19:36.723 --> 02:19:38.464]  And this is in the paper three weeks ago.
[02:19:38.545 --> 02:19:39.045]  Oh, sir!
[02:19:39.065 --> 02:19:40.327]  It goes straight to Indianapolis.
[02:19:40.547 --> 02:19:41.988]  Sir, have you seen the takeover?
[02:19:43.029 --> 02:19:44.231]  No, I'm going to order that.
[02:19:44.913 --> 02:19:46.653]  I mean, I made that again in 2000.
[02:19:47.214 --> 02:19:54.876]  They just announced that the old airport, Mueller, bolts and chains, porta-potties, barbed wire, it's an emergency center.
[02:19:54.976 --> 02:19:58.857]  The bolts and chains in the floor, they admit you'll be chained down.
[02:19:59.637 --> 02:20:02.998]  It's a camp, and we just built it for you.
[02:20:03.038 --> 02:20:05.278]  Before 9-1-1, of course.
[02:20:05.798 --> 02:20:08.639]  Before the convenience of the attack.
[02:20:09.359 --> 02:20:12.100]  But, I mean, don't you feel like putting a plastic flag on your car now?
[02:20:14.648 --> 02:20:16.390]  I'm sad that more people aren't aware.
[02:20:16.911 --> 02:20:19.495]  Tell me what your local paper said, and I want a copy of it.
[02:20:19.775 --> 02:20:21.558]  What are they doing at the Loving Airport?
[02:20:22.526 --> 02:20:31.311]  They're putting together an emergency center where they can collect people and if there's an outbreak of some sort of disease or there's any other disaster.
[02:20:31.852 --> 02:20:43.038]  But because the airport is limited in size, they're going to take people by rail, by a special rail that they have just rerouted in the last couple weeks, to Indianapolis.
[02:20:44.159 --> 02:20:46.300]  And that's how people will be leaving the city.
[02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:46.981]  Oh, rail!
[02:20:47.481 --> 02:20:47.941]  By rail.
[02:20:48.662 --> 02:20:50.223]  Oh, it's getting even better!
[02:20:51.688 --> 02:20:52.929]  That sounds like freedom.
[02:20:53.729 --> 02:20:55.030]  Of course, the border's wide open.
[02:20:55.791 --> 02:20:56.711]  Now, let me understand this.
[02:20:58.032 --> 02:20:58.592]  I'm begging you.
[02:20:58.632 --> 02:20:59.112]  Fax me.
[02:20:59.173 --> 02:20:59.513]  Mail me.
[02:20:59.553 --> 02:21:00.413]  I've got to have that article.
[02:21:00.673 --> 02:21:01.534]  What was this in, sir?
[02:21:02.735 --> 02:21:03.415]  I'm sorry, sir?
[02:21:03.895 --> 02:21:05.616]  What paper was this article in?
[02:21:05.656 --> 02:21:06.677]  That was in the Times.
[02:21:08.303 --> 02:21:09.083]  And what's the Times?
[02:21:09.743 --> 02:21:11.744]  That's the generic regional paper.
[02:21:11.784 --> 02:21:17.166]  Its original name was the Hammond Times, and now it's just the Times because it serves a larger region.
[02:21:17.866 --> 02:21:27.189]  In fact, last week they announced that many of the municipalities in that area, Gary, Hammond, Crown Point, want to merge into one large entity.
[02:21:27.629 --> 02:21:32.871]  Oh, it's regionalization, and there'll be a board over it that you don't elect, but that's okay.
[02:21:34.071 --> 02:21:36.572]  Now, it's all part of the new Freedom Act.
[02:21:37.336 --> 02:21:39.097]  So, when did the Times report this?
[02:21:39.997 --> 02:21:44.679]  The rail cars about three weeks ago and the consolidation one week ago.
[02:21:46.599 --> 02:21:49.380]  And so they have rail cars to take us for our safety.
[02:21:52.041 --> 02:21:55.783]  And right on time to legitimize all this subconsciously is the SARS outbreak.
[02:21:55.823 --> 02:21:56.603]  It's for our safety.
[02:21:58.450 --> 02:21:59.290]  For our safety.
[02:21:59.691 --> 02:22:01.912]  It's all for your safety, John.
[02:22:02.372 --> 02:22:10.996]  Camps and cops and black ski masks and hover drones and foreign trips and secret arrests and cameras everywhere.
[02:22:11.636 --> 02:22:12.856]  It's to keep you safe.
[02:22:12.876 --> 02:22:15.498]  Do you think people are waking up there in Indiana?
[02:22:16.658 --> 02:22:18.099]  Some will never wake up.
[02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:22.481]  While it's happening, they won't wake up.
[02:22:23.921 --> 02:22:25.062]  I don't know what the problem is.
[02:22:26.175 --> 02:22:32.382]  Maybe the indoctrination is just too strong here, but people... Well, it's like these women.
[02:22:32.422 --> 02:22:34.444]  These five women allegedly get kidnapped by this guy.
[02:22:34.484 --> 02:22:35.525]  They've now got a lot of evidence.
[02:22:35.965 --> 02:22:38.208]  He tortures them, he releases them, and they don't tell on him.
[02:22:38.889 --> 02:22:39.629]  It's mind control.
[02:22:39.970 --> 02:22:46.336]  These people are tortured, mindless, giggling sports fans who don't even know how to think, John, so they're drooling idiots.
[02:22:46.396 --> 02:22:46.757]  Go ahead.
[02:22:47.828 --> 02:22:49.169]  That's a big problem.
[02:22:49.209 --> 02:22:50.611]  I don't know what will wake them up.
[02:22:51.071 --> 02:22:51.912]  Well, hey, listen.
[02:22:52.192 --> 02:22:53.293]  How long ago was that article?
[02:22:54.134 --> 02:22:55.936]  One week on the consolidation.
[02:22:55.956 --> 02:22:56.477]  I'll tell you what.
[02:22:56.497 --> 02:22:56.837]  Stay there.
[02:22:56.937 --> 02:22:57.518]  Dig one out.
[02:22:57.618 --> 02:22:58.418]  Give me the webinar.
[02:22:58.438 --> 02:22:58.819]  Stay there.
[02:22:59.279 --> 02:23:00.601]  I want to go get this article right now.
[02:23:00.661 --> 02:23:02.663]  Somebody email it to TimsonInfoWorks.com.
[02:23:02.683 --> 02:23:03.203]  We'll be right back.
[02:23:03.223 --> 02:23:03.784]  Stay there, John.
[02:23:05.465 --> 02:23:06.626]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.867 --> 02:23:08.488]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.389 --> 02:23:12.052]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.163 --> 02:23:21.346]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:23:22.047 --> 02:23:25.889]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... 034438.
[02:23:25.929 --> 02:23:26.849]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:23:27.109 --> 02:23:27.870]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:23:46.949 --> 02:23:47.689]  I'm here, folks.
[02:23:47.709 --> 02:23:48.669]  You want real news.
[02:23:48.689 --> 02:23:52.631]  You want to know about the vice that's closing around you and your family's freedoms.
[02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:53.591]  You're next.
[02:23:54.472 --> 02:23:58.493]  The police being bred to hate you and hate your rights and to see you as slaves.
[02:23:59.114 --> 02:24:00.614]  They're just taking care of you.
[02:24:00.674 --> 02:24:01.154]  Shut up.
[02:24:01.194 --> 02:24:02.495]  You don't know what's good for you.
[02:24:03.915 --> 02:24:05.316]  Get off the slave ship.
[02:24:05.336 --> 02:24:07.537]  You're lucky we brought you here from Africa.
[02:24:08.777 --> 02:24:09.758]  It's the same mindset.
[02:24:09.798 --> 02:24:12.439]  We're taking care of you, you ignorant son of a gun.
[02:24:13.570 --> 02:24:14.451]  The same system.
[02:24:15.151 --> 02:24:17.173]  That's what the globalists are doing to us.
[02:24:17.193 --> 02:24:19.674]  The same mindset they've got is those slavers.
[02:24:20.535 --> 02:24:22.076]  Slavers are always the same, aren't they?
[02:24:23.637 --> 02:24:26.279]  Let's go ahead and go back to John.
[02:24:26.759 --> 02:24:28.861]  John, what's the website for this newspaper?
[02:24:29.261 --> 02:24:30.081]  You say a week ago.
[02:24:30.161 --> 02:24:30.942]  What's the headline?
[02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:31.622]  I can go find it.
[02:24:31.923 --> 02:24:32.343]  Okay.
[02:24:32.603 --> 02:24:35.965]  The website is thetimesonline.com.
[02:24:38.157 --> 02:24:39.197]  I've been to that website before.
[02:24:39.317 --> 02:24:40.278]  Online.com.
[02:24:41.158 --> 02:24:44.621]  And they do have an archive and a pretty good search and contact.
[02:24:45.221 --> 02:24:49.484]  The other local paper is post-trib.com.
[02:24:49.664 --> 02:24:53.646]  Post-trib.com.
[02:24:53.726 --> 02:24:55.467]  Do you have one in front of you?
[02:24:55.487 --> 02:24:56.728]  What's the headline about the trains?
[02:24:56.748 --> 02:25:01.111]  I don't have it in front of me, but I most certainly can get that and get it faxed out to you.
[02:25:01.753 --> 02:25:03.153]  Or email to you if you want a tip.
[02:25:03.574 --> 02:25:03.874]  Both.
[02:25:03.954 --> 02:25:05.354]  Tips at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:05.394 --> 02:25:08.055]  You'll hear me talking about it on the show.
[02:25:08.315 --> 02:25:08.775]  Next show.
[02:25:10.435 --> 02:25:12.036]  Tips at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:12.476 --> 02:25:13.556]  Okay.
[02:25:13.576 --> 02:25:15.377]  So what was it?
[02:25:15.417 --> 02:25:17.357]  Like emergency plan was the headline.
[02:25:17.397 --> 02:25:18.317]  We love you.
[02:25:19.258 --> 02:25:19.938]  Don't run.
[02:25:19.998 --> 02:25:23.699]  It's some nice, wonderful, warm showers for you inside.
[02:25:24.139 --> 02:25:25.059]  What did the headline say?
[02:25:25.079 --> 02:25:30.221]  It was something about emergency planning.
[02:25:30.561 --> 02:25:30.781]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:30.801 --> 02:25:31.361]  It's a good...
[02:25:32.850 --> 02:25:33.971]  It's for your safety.
[02:25:35.432 --> 02:25:37.033]  It's always for your safety, John.
[02:25:37.433 --> 02:25:39.034]  John, can you believe this is happening?
[02:25:39.554 --> 02:25:40.095]  Very sad.
[02:25:40.735 --> 02:25:42.636]  But yes, I do believe it's happening.
[02:25:42.836 --> 02:25:44.397]  It's the way people typically react.
[02:25:45.738 --> 02:25:48.480]  Things just... It's happened in Europe.
[02:25:48.860 --> 02:25:50.041]  It's happened many times.
[02:25:50.141 --> 02:25:52.322]  And people just go along with the plan.
[02:25:54.003 --> 02:25:54.884]  It is disgusting.
[02:25:54.904 --> 02:25:57.305]  Well, God bless you, and I'm looking forward to that.
[02:25:58.006 --> 02:26:00.367]  In fact, are you by a computer right now?
[02:26:00.648 --> 02:26:01.028]  Yes, I am.
[02:26:01.667 --> 02:26:12.129]  If you can find that article in the next 10 minutes, 15 minutes before I go to break, if you can email it to tips at infowars.com, I can print it and have it down here in the final segment.
[02:26:12.449 --> 02:26:13.309]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:26:13.550 --> 02:26:14.290]  Thanks a lot, John.
[02:26:15.450 --> 02:26:19.411]  If not, it'll be here tomorrow, or tonight, I guess, 9 to midnight Central Time.
[02:26:20.051 --> 02:26:23.972]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas.
[02:26:24.032 --> 02:26:24.832]  John, thanks for holding.
[02:26:24.872 --> 02:26:25.272]  Go ahead.
[02:26:26.081 --> 02:26:27.221]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:26:27.722 --> 02:26:28.242]  Oh, good.
[02:26:28.262 --> 02:26:29.602]  What did you think about that?
[02:26:29.642 --> 02:26:35.144]  You're loving... I know our airport's a concentration camp part of it, but... Oh, his, too.
[02:26:35.204 --> 02:26:35.924]  Isn't that nice?
[02:26:36.264 --> 02:26:37.745]  With a nice train ride.
[02:26:37.765 --> 02:26:42.286]  I'm wondering if the National Guard armory down here is going to be turned into one of those.
[02:26:43.568 --> 02:26:53.136]  Hey, listen, the reason why I called is I've noticed a lot of encouragement while listening to your show, people calling in saying I'm making lots of copies, yada, yada.
[02:26:54.096 --> 02:27:02.883]  But I've also noticed a lot of discouragement, a lot of fear out there, and I kind of wanted to read something to you guys real quick, especially you little homeschoolers, all you little patriots out there.
[02:27:02.903 --> 02:27:04.704]  It's a good history lesson.
[02:27:05.325 --> 02:27:06.226]  If it's okay, Alex.
[02:27:08.227 --> 02:27:08.848]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:27:09.088 --> 02:27:09.328]  Okay.
[02:27:10.114 --> 02:27:15.758]  I'm reading this out of one of Claire Wolfe's books, 101 Things to Do Till the Revolution.
[02:27:15.778 --> 02:27:16.578]  This is number 30.
[02:27:17.319 --> 02:27:18.700]  Remember Mother Bathoryk.
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:25.765]  On those days when you feel outnumbered, when you know the tyrants are going to win no matter what you do, remember the people in this little story.
[02:27:26.305 --> 02:27:31.909]  It's true, and it took place on April 19, 1775, the day of the battles of Lexington and Concord.
[02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:38.073]  The embattled farmers of poetic fame had already begun to rout the well-armed, well-trained redcoats of General Cage.
[02:27:38.732 --> 02:27:45.098]  Gage attempted to send two ammunition wagons accompanied by an officer and 13 grenadiers, the biggest and toughest of the soldiers.
[02:27:45.919 --> 02:27:50.503]  The resupply is truth, but along the road they ran into a handful of ordinary Americans.
[02:27:51.198 --> 02:27:58.564]  This little convoy was intercepted on the road by a party of elderly New England men who were exempt from service with the militia by reason of their age.
[02:27:59.084 --> 02:28:09.752]  These gray-headed soldiers did not make a formidable appearance, but they were hardened veterans who made up and experienced what they lacked in youth and were brilliantly led by David Lamson, described as a mulatto in the records.
[02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:17.526]  With patience and skill, these men laid a cunning ambush for the British ammunition wagons, waited until they approached, and demanded their surrender.
[02:28:18.066 --> 02:28:23.651]  The British drivers were not impressed by these superannuated warriors and responded by whipping their teams forward.
[02:28:24.172 --> 02:28:25.393]  The old men opened fire.
[02:28:25.653 --> 02:28:32.499]  With careful economy of effort, they systematically shot the lead horses in their traces, killed two sergeants, and wounded the officer in command.
[02:28:33.143 --> 02:28:38.767]  The surviving British soldiers, and here's where it gets interesting, took another look at these old men and fled for their lives.
[02:28:39.207 --> 02:28:43.010]  They ran down the road, threw their weapons into a pond, and started running again.
[02:28:43.570 --> 02:28:50.915]  They came upon an old woman named Mother Bathrick, so impoverished that she was digging a few weeds from a vacant field for something to eat.
[02:28:51.535 --> 02:28:55.018]  The panic-stricken British troops surrendered to her and begged her protection.
[02:28:55.498 --> 02:28:58.560]  She led them to the house of Militia Captain Ephraim Frost.
[02:28:59.306 --> 02:29:03.309]  Mother Batherick may have been poor in material things, but she was rich in the spirit.
[02:29:03.809 --> 02:29:12.736]  As she delivered her captives to Captain Frost, she told them, If you ever live to get back, you tell King George that an old woman took six of his grenadiers prisoner.
[02:29:13.456 --> 02:29:18.740]  Afterward, English critics of Lord North's ministry used this episode to teach a lesson in political arithmetic.
[02:29:19.321 --> 02:29:24.945]  If one old Yankee woman can take six grenadiers, how many soldiers will it require to conquer America?
[02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:26.081]  Exactly.
[02:29:26.101 --> 02:29:39.576]  You think the Globals can have these victories when they kick out their former CIA partner, a dirty little thug like Saddam, and rain cash down and pay people in gold bars to join him, and then blow out all the infrastructure and let people starve to death?
[02:29:39.976 --> 02:29:40.777]  That's one thing.
[02:29:41.218 --> 02:29:42.199]  We're Americans.
[02:29:42.599 --> 02:29:43.780]  We're not putting up with it.
[02:29:43.861 --> 02:29:45.002]  If 1% of us fight...
[02:29:45.894 --> 02:29:52.061]  That is 2,670,000 plus people.
[02:29:52.622 --> 02:29:54.924]  We are going to win this fight.
[02:29:54.944 --> 02:29:55.946]  Let them keep abusing.
[02:29:56.686 --> 02:29:57.708]  Same thing with Waco.
[02:29:58.048 --> 02:30:03.094]  Feds pull up, open fire, helicopters open fire, they shoot a bunch of Davidians, a few people shoot back.
[02:30:03.877 --> 02:30:04.137]  Mm-hmm.
[02:30:04.197 --> 02:30:04.558]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:30:23.815 --> 02:30:26.276]  You know, this shows the mental illness of these thugs.
[02:30:26.496 --> 02:30:30.899]  They're always busting in houses and shooting some old blind man or the wrong house and killing.
[02:30:31.239 --> 02:30:32.079]  I'm sick of it.
[02:30:32.259 --> 02:30:33.260]  I'm tired of bullies.
[02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:34.741]  And I'm tired of what they're doing.
[02:30:34.901 --> 02:30:41.224]  And I'm tired of the government that's drug dealing and it's child kidnapping and the sicko rings of judges and the rest of them.
[02:30:41.504 --> 02:30:47.647]  And I'm telling you, folks, if you just wake up to how evil these people are, we wouldn't have to put up with this and we could save America.
[02:30:47.667 --> 02:30:49.128]  Exactly, Alex.
[02:30:49.208 --> 02:30:51.569]  And the reason why I call this, I'm a dad.
[02:30:52.171 --> 02:30:59.076]  And I always hear these guys calling up saying, you know, I want to do something, but man, I'm scared for my children.
[02:30:59.136 --> 02:31:01.218]  Well, how do you think I feel, folks?
[02:31:01.658 --> 02:31:03.800]  I've got three young daughters.
[02:31:03.920 --> 02:31:04.800]  Two of them are infants.
[02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:05.501]  But you know what?
[02:31:05.641 --> 02:31:12.306]  I'm so scared that I'm going to stand up and I'm going to fight for them because I would rather die than have my children become slaves.
[02:31:12.666 --> 02:31:19.271]  You men, like Dave and Joyce are always saying, you men need to get the lace off your panties.
[02:31:19.930 --> 02:31:21.511]  All right, well, I appreciate the call.
[02:31:21.551 --> 02:31:22.131]  You take care.
[02:31:22.171 --> 02:31:27.033]  We'll take some more calls from Myron in South Dakota and others.
[02:31:27.053 --> 02:31:29.254]  And the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:31:29.474 --> 02:31:34.356]  I've been trying to dig through my giant stack of news here.
[02:31:34.836 --> 02:31:37.137]  You know, homeschoolers, what is it, the last four or five?
[02:31:37.217 --> 02:31:38.577]  I don't keep track anymore.
[02:31:39.118 --> 02:31:40.778]  Have won the International Spelling Bee.
[02:31:40.838 --> 02:31:41.979]  It's two years in a row.
[02:31:42.499 --> 02:31:44.740]  The big International Geography Bee.
[02:31:46.371 --> 02:31:47.912]  This is stuff the kids can't fake.
[02:31:48.312 --> 02:31:52.334]  The kid can't fake knowing how to spell supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
[02:31:53.314 --> 02:31:59.457]  The kid can't fake spelling hyperbolic transmutation ovococcalator.
[02:31:59.477 --> 02:32:01.098]  No, they cannot fake that.
[02:32:02.799 --> 02:32:03.619]  That's real.
[02:32:04.780 --> 02:32:08.141]  And they keep winning over and over again everything, the homeschoolers.
[02:32:08.882 --> 02:32:13.464]  And I read yesterday, and we're going to be getting these folks on the show, they're banning homeschooling.
[02:32:14.056 --> 02:32:15.937]  In California, you just said you can't homeschool anymore.
[02:32:16.358 --> 02:32:21.141]  You've got to have a teaching certificate, so now I guess you won't want your kids to be getting brainwashed in a camp.
[02:32:21.601 --> 02:32:25.184]  You've got to go get a license from them, but that won't be good enough, of course.
[02:32:25.524 --> 02:32:32.789]  And now that the exodus has reached three-plus million kids currently being homeschooled, it was two million like a year ago, and a million two years before that, they've done the math.
[02:32:32.809 --> 02:32:35.711]  I mean, it's going to be ten million in a couple years, the way it's going.
[02:32:36.251 --> 02:32:42.155]  Liberals, conservatives, I mean, they find out their kids are learning how to snort cocaine, how to report mommy and daddy for owning guns.
[02:32:42.335 --> 02:32:43.196]  You're getting your kids out.
[02:32:46.067 --> 02:32:46.627]  You're good to go.
[02:32:46.667 --> 02:32:46.807]  I think?
[02:33:09.730 --> 02:33:11.052]  They'll harass homeschoolers.
[02:33:11.093 --> 02:33:18.065]  Now, they're harassing something like 1% of them, but highly publicizing it to create fear so you won't do it.
[02:33:21.167 --> 02:33:22.868]  They know it's tough on you to homeschool.
[02:33:22.908 --> 02:33:23.908]  They know it's already hard.
[02:33:23.928 --> 02:33:26.589]  So they can give you a rationale, scare you not to do it.
[02:33:26.849 --> 02:33:28.890]  No, the answer is more people need to homeschool.
[02:33:29.130 --> 02:33:33.251]  Don't give your children to these dirty, evil schools where they teach them every manner of wickedness.
[02:33:33.551 --> 02:33:33.992]  And they do.
[02:33:34.032 --> 02:33:35.572]  I don't care if it's rural or big city.
[02:33:35.892 --> 02:33:37.633]  These things are dirty cesspools.
[02:33:37.933 --> 02:33:40.554]  You may have some good teachers, but the curriculum's federally written.
[02:33:41.767 --> 02:33:43.989]  You know, the zero tolerance.
[02:33:44.049 --> 02:33:46.412]  You caught playing dodgeball, you go to jail, folks.
[02:33:46.472 --> 02:33:48.854]  I mean, it's training your kids on how to be prisoners.
[02:33:49.094 --> 02:33:50.456]  They're putting thumb scanners in.
[02:33:50.476 --> 02:33:52.277]  They're saying they won't let you have your kids.
[02:33:52.618 --> 02:33:55.240]  If there's an alert, I mean, just get them out, folks.
[02:33:57.823 --> 02:33:58.603]  You know, downsize.
[02:33:58.664 --> 02:33:59.484]  Buy a smaller house.
[02:33:59.985 --> 02:34:00.806]  Get an extra job.
[02:34:00.866 --> 02:34:01.286]  Whatever.
[02:34:01.306 --> 02:34:04.109]  You know, tell your husband, I want you to work two jobs.
[02:34:05.183 --> 02:34:09.105]  Little Bobby, Little Susie is not going to that brainwashing Nazi camp.
[02:34:09.586 --> 02:34:11.527]  That Hitler-Hugin re-education center.
[02:34:12.027 --> 02:34:14.588]  You get your child out of the camp.
[02:34:14.908 --> 02:34:17.730]  Your daughter at bare minimum is going to learn how to be a crack whore.
[02:34:18.430 --> 02:34:19.791]  I mean, the kids, folks, I see it.
[02:34:19.811 --> 02:34:20.572]  The kids are gone.
[02:34:21.172 --> 02:34:22.152]  I drive around Austin.
[02:34:22.233 --> 02:34:24.494]  I mean, rich neighborhoods, poor neighborhoods.
[02:34:26.175 --> 02:34:27.415]  I mean, your kids are gone, folks.
[02:34:27.495 --> 02:34:28.796]  I don't know what you've done to your kids.
[02:34:29.096 --> 02:34:29.537]  I see it.
[02:34:29.617 --> 02:34:30.537]  It is nightmarish.
[02:34:30.577 --> 02:34:32.058]  And I know what's going on in other parts of the country.
[02:34:32.098 --> 02:34:32.738]  I've been to other areas.
[02:34:32.778 --> 02:34:33.659]  It's even worse.
[02:34:34.835 --> 02:34:36.716]  The media says just turn your kids loose.
[02:34:37.497 --> 02:34:38.678]  Do not do it!
[02:34:40.078 --> 02:34:42.960]  And your kids won't rebel if you explain the government wants to ace them.
[02:34:43.581 --> 02:34:45.662]  The government wants to tear them up.
[02:34:45.702 --> 02:34:46.903]  The government wants to dumb them down.
[02:34:46.923 --> 02:34:52.767]  If you explain the real system, your child will ally with you and you'll be in a tribal unit like we were in the past.
[02:34:54.288 --> 02:34:55.849]  People used to respect their parents.
[02:34:56.869 --> 02:34:59.771]  You can get that back, but you've got to be somebody they can respect.
[02:35:01.332 --> 02:35:02.593]  And I found this where this little...
[02:35:03.251 --> 02:35:04.371]  He's not Vietnamese.
[02:35:04.391 --> 02:35:05.732]  He's a little Taiwanese kid.
[02:35:05.752 --> 02:35:13.413]  He's a graduate-level microbiology and genetics with DNA sequencing coding new systems.
[02:35:14.934 --> 02:35:16.114]  Graduate work.
[02:35:17.514 --> 02:35:18.674]  And I'm trying to find it.
[02:35:18.734 --> 02:35:22.655]  I mean, he's like 13 or something, and they couldn't believe it.
[02:35:22.695 --> 02:35:23.776]  They had him redo the test.
[02:35:24.256 --> 02:35:25.136]  They said, oh, he's homeschooled.
[02:35:25.156 --> 02:35:25.816]  We can't believe it.
[02:35:26.296 --> 02:35:29.757]  And then it turned out he could do even better stuff when the professor asked him to do stuff.
[02:35:30.729 --> 02:35:35.495]  And he won this big, gigantic award.
[02:35:37.878 --> 02:35:40.902]  So it's very, very... Here's an interesting one.
[02:35:40.942 --> 02:35:43.386]  Scientists breed cancer beating mice.
[02:35:43.426 --> 02:35:46.249]  You better believe the Rockefellers are going to get that development.
[02:35:46.269 --> 02:35:47.471]  You'll never hear about it again.
[02:35:48.354 --> 02:35:48.975]  Oh, here's one.
[02:35:49.395 --> 02:35:51.818]  Slow start for Gephardt and Iowa Money Primary.
[02:35:52.218 --> 02:35:53.960]  Oh, it was the same newspaper.
[02:35:54.160 --> 02:36:01.408]  There's another one in here where the police cars are getting federally funded to put thumb scanners in the police cars.
[02:36:01.748 --> 02:36:05.552]  Now when they ask for license registration, they're going to ask for thumbprint, too.
[02:36:05.652 --> 02:36:06.813]  See, the same system.
[02:36:06.853 --> 02:36:10.497]  Now the banks are going to ask for a laser scan, even if you have an account.
[02:36:10.797 --> 02:36:12.798]  The same scanner going in the grocery store.
[02:36:13.518 --> 02:36:14.478]  The slave grid.
[02:36:14.518 --> 02:36:14.859]  Here it is.
[02:36:15.159 --> 02:36:17.299]  Police get power to check prints on the spot.
[02:36:17.319 --> 02:36:18.240]  This is the Oregonian.
[02:36:18.660 --> 02:36:19.160]  Another article.
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:20.241]  Yes, you have another paper.
[02:36:20.281 --> 02:36:21.661]  This is on Infowars.com.
[02:36:22.141 --> 02:36:29.704]  Portland police may soon be asking for more than a license when making a traffic stop, but also requesting a motorist to stick out a thumb or a forefinger.
[02:36:30.144 --> 02:36:31.105]  Say no in mass!
[02:36:31.145 --> 02:36:31.785]  Get arrested!
[02:36:33.743 --> 02:36:35.905]  You know, if I was on in Portland, we could stop this.
[02:36:36.285 --> 02:36:39.188]  By the way, they are now setting up a system.
[02:36:39.648 --> 02:36:40.789]  Again, it's already in your cars.
[02:36:41.350 --> 02:36:42.611]  Oregon's moving to do it first.
[02:36:43.051 --> 02:36:45.653]  Satellite track and tax you to drive your cars.
[02:36:48.216 --> 02:36:49.317]  And it's a federal setup.
[02:36:49.617 --> 02:36:53.020]  You know, up in Oklahoma, they're voting to put in thumb scanning to get the driver's license.
[02:36:53.540 --> 02:36:56.263]  I'm warning you folks, 42 states are now doing it.
[02:36:56.283 --> 02:36:56.723]  We're down to 8.
[02:36:57.103 --> 02:36:58.064]  It was 12 that weren't.
[02:36:58.104 --> 02:36:58.885]  Now it's 8 that aren't.
[02:36:59.716 --> 02:37:00.876]  They put in thumb scanners.
[02:37:01.236 --> 02:37:06.577]  That goes in the grocery store, the banks, and then they start the national sales tax on top of the income tax.
[02:37:07.178 --> 02:37:07.638]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:08.438 --> 02:37:08.938]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:09.538 --> 02:37:09.918]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:09.958 --> 02:37:11.619]  You may not care about being surveilled.
[02:37:11.639 --> 02:37:12.899]  You're going to care about getting taxed.
[02:37:13.559 --> 02:37:14.519]  Nobody asks you.
[02:37:14.539 --> 02:37:16.160]  They're building this giant prison for you.
[02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:17.040]  Wake up!
[02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:18.700]  Farm organizations!
[02:37:18.820 --> 02:37:19.700]  Resist this!
[02:37:21.341 --> 02:37:22.021]  I'm so mad.
[02:37:22.101 --> 02:37:22.821]  I'm so sick of it.
[02:37:23.479 --> 02:37:28.222]  I want to get Max Bernstein of the Oregonian on, but I've got articles all over the country where they're doing this now.
[02:37:28.543 --> 02:37:31.845]  Portland police may soon be asking for more than a license when making a traffic stop.
[02:37:32.185 --> 02:37:36.168]  They're also requesting, requesting, requesting, please give me your thumb.
[02:37:36.448 --> 02:37:37.509]  People don't know how to say no.
[02:37:37.549 --> 02:37:38.430]  They'll threaten to arrest you.
[02:37:38.670 --> 02:37:39.070]  What's wrong?
[02:37:39.090 --> 02:37:41.992]  What do you got to hide and go, look, man, that's a violation of my Fourth Amendment.
[02:37:42.012 --> 02:37:43.393]  You're not going to scan my body.
[02:37:43.433 --> 02:37:44.154]  That's for crooks.
[02:37:45.295 --> 02:37:47.596]  But you notice they've already been thumb scanning at the driver's license.
[02:37:47.616 --> 02:37:49.598]  See, it's getting you used to giving it up.
[02:37:50.894 --> 02:37:53.562]  I'm also requesting a motorist to stick out a thumb and forefinger.
[02:37:53.983 --> 02:37:58.055]  Next month, more than a dozen officers will carry handheld devices on them.
[02:37:58.949 --> 02:38:03.173]  ...on the street that will allow them to instantly verify a person's identity by analyzing their fingerprints.
[02:38:03.193 --> 02:38:16.965]  The Portland Police Bureau was awarded $250,000 from Federal Cops Grant to equip each of its five precincts with a device and distribute another ten to investigate officers in the detective gang enforcement.
[02:38:16.985 --> 02:38:18.607]  See, it's about gangs first.
[02:38:18.627 --> 02:38:22.390]  See, they'll do it to the little gang member first and then to you on the highway.
[02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:25.593]  Drugs and Vice and Tactical Operations Divisions.
[02:38:27.037 --> 02:38:31.167]  The Minnesota-based Idenix manufactures the technology.
[02:38:32.276 --> 02:38:38.461]  Satan, the board chairman, I mean, I'm sorry, which captures fingerprints at the scene and remotely transmits them to a database.
[02:38:38.481 --> 02:38:49.010]  The Portland police will run the prints against FDI's automated fingerprint database that hooks into your state license where you thumb scan to get it, and a database of seven western states known as the Western Identification Network.
[02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:50.311]  See all regionalism.
[02:38:50.752 --> 02:38:57.637]  If there is a match, the system returns the person's name, date of birth, and mugshot directly to the officer's handheld terminal.
[02:38:58.098 --> 02:38:59.199]  The size...
[02:39:00.189 --> 02:39:00.489]  Yes, Alex.
[02:39:00.509 --> 02:39:03.390]  I saw a report where the spelling contest here in South Dakota
[02:39:25.358 --> 02:39:28.020]  The four top positions were won by homeschoolers.
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:32.444]  In South Dakota, there's only 1% of the people who do homeschooling.
[02:39:32.484 --> 02:39:34.445]  So I thought that was quite an achievement.
[02:39:34.545 --> 02:39:37.347]  Well, I mean, look, I'm not bashing homeschoolers because they're great.
[02:39:37.367 --> 02:39:38.808]  They're parents that care more, obviously.
[02:39:39.909 --> 02:39:42.711]  They were already genetically more intelligent because they are homeschooling.
[02:39:42.731 --> 02:39:43.512]  That's a good choice.
[02:39:44.052 --> 02:39:45.934]  Already there's a selective process.
[02:39:46.634 --> 02:39:49.397]  You don't get your beer-swilling sports fan that's into homeschooling.
[02:39:50.858 --> 02:39:54.701]  He doesn't care if his daughter at 12 is in the back with a bunch of gang members.
[02:39:56.282 --> 02:40:01.987]  The deal here is, though, you've got in the country, it's about 1.5% total now are homeschooling.
[02:40:02.007 --> 02:40:03.028]  A little more, they're saying now.
[02:40:04.218 --> 02:40:08.924]  So the government panics, tries to ban it, tries to call it, quote, homeschooling is child abuse.
[02:40:08.944 --> 02:40:09.966]  They say you can't homeschool.
[02:40:10.026 --> 02:40:11.868]  If you do, it's child abuse in California.
[02:40:12.329 --> 02:40:15.853]  Now that's just blatantly, they want your kids in their dumbed down center.
[02:40:16.154 --> 02:40:22.542]  And even the private schools are now getting federal guidelines and funding and following orders and doing all the zero tolerance garbage.
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:25.181]  So, think about that.
[02:40:25.281 --> 02:40:26.422]  They're winning everything.
[02:40:26.482 --> 02:40:28.103]  The colleges are fighting over them.
[02:40:28.724 --> 02:40:30.325]  But they're trying to shut it down.
[02:40:30.545 --> 02:40:34.767]  And they're teaching the kids in public school 2 plus 2 equals 5 in fuzzy math.
[02:40:34.787 --> 02:40:35.308]  So go ahead.
[02:40:36.488 --> 02:40:40.671]  Alex, you did an interview with Stanley Hilton on March 11th.
[02:40:41.472 --> 02:40:43.913]  It is between 9.30 and 11 in the evening.
[02:40:43.933 --> 02:40:46.995]  Is there any way to get a copy of that interview?
[02:40:47.015 --> 02:40:48.456]  Are you on the internet?
[02:40:49.096 --> 02:40:49.677]  No, I'm not.
[02:40:50.279 --> 02:40:52.780]  Well, if you are on the Internet, go to prisonplanet.com.
[02:40:53.161 --> 02:40:55.282]  Go to the audio archive, and there is an audio.
[02:40:55.322 --> 02:40:56.843]  The interview is there in its entirety.
[02:40:57.943 --> 02:40:59.804]  Or you can, this is Stanley Hilton.
[02:40:59.864 --> 02:41:00.865]  There's about 100 interviews there.
[02:41:01.305 --> 02:41:02.325]  Great listening, by the way.
[02:41:03.366 --> 02:41:07.188]  Or you can simply write to Genesis.
[02:41:07.308 --> 02:41:08.669]  They've got a subgroup there.
[02:41:09.793 --> 02:41:12.994]  It has a mailing address, and I'll try to find that out.
[02:41:13.114 --> 02:41:13.935]  I did all that.
[02:41:14.095 --> 02:41:22.838]  I keep sending them the money, and they keep sending me the daytime program, and I tried to get somebody to call me, and the last time, I sent them $25 already.
[02:41:23.358 --> 02:41:28.800]  They sent me a... Well, you'll have to call them, because I don't do that, and it can get confusing.
[02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:32.021]  You need to really specify nighttime.
[02:41:32.041 --> 02:41:33.322]  Tell you what, they're there right now.
[02:41:33.342 --> 02:41:34.222]  I want to talk to them right now.
[02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:44.617]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:44.898 --> 02:41:49.622]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:49.862 --> 02:41:55.508]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.748 --> 02:42:00.251]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:42:00.492 --> 02:42:07.637]  The cashless society control grid, implanable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:42:07.657 --> 02:42:12.201]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:42:12.361 --> 02:42:14.883]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:42:15.103 --> 02:42:21.808]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:42:22.048 --> 02:42:27.312]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:27.332 --> 02:42:27.733]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:35.985 --> 02:42:39.448]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:42:39.728 --> 02:42:43.211]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:42:43.312 --> 02:42:47.255]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:42:47.475 --> 02:42:53.641]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.041 --> 02:43:01.968]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:43:02.368 --> 02:43:07.709]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:43:07.869 --> 02:43:11.630]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:13.851]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:43:13.911 --> 02:43:16.111]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:43:16.331 --> 02:43:21.572]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:43:21.612 --> 02:43:26.853]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:43:51.602 --> 02:43:52.263]  We're good to go.
[02:44:11.817 --> 02:44:12.337]  We're good to go.
[02:44:12.357 --> 02:44:13.138]  We're good to go.
[02:44:36.567 --> 02:44:38.768]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:44:39.328 --> 02:44:42.130]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:54.848 --> 02:44:55.348]  All right.
[02:44:55.508 --> 02:44:58.790]  We were just talking to Myron, and he's talking to folks at the Genesis.
[02:44:59.270 --> 02:45:01.530]  You know, Myron, I'm not involved in the tapes.
[02:45:01.550 --> 02:45:05.412]  We posted it for free at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:45:05.432 --> 02:45:07.673]  We have a transcript of the Stanley Hilton interview.
[02:45:07.753 --> 02:45:11.074]  Now the entire thing is up for free at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:45:11.874 --> 02:45:13.134]  But I know what probably happened there.
[02:45:13.154 --> 02:45:17.735]  You got the daytime show, and it was a live nighttime show with Bob Dole's former chief of staff.
[02:45:17.795 --> 02:45:22.777]  It says the government carried out 9-1-1, not that they had prior knowledge, and he's got all the witnesses and the evidence.
[02:45:23.457 --> 02:45:27.037]  I re-aired that during the day, not the whole thing.
[02:45:27.097 --> 02:45:28.498]  That's probably what you're talking about.
[02:45:28.538 --> 02:45:33.719]  But on other issues, do you have anything else you'd like to add there, Myron?
[02:45:35.248 --> 02:45:36.569]  Anything else you'd like to discuss, Myron?
[02:45:36.909 --> 02:45:37.189]  Yes.
[02:45:37.629 --> 02:45:38.149]  Do you hear me?
[02:45:38.349 --> 02:45:39.009]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:45:39.089 --> 02:45:39.390]  Okay.
[02:45:39.630 --> 02:45:40.670]  Thought you didn't hear me.
[02:45:40.770 --> 02:45:43.911]  Last Friday on C-SPAN, I don't know if anybody called you.
[02:45:44.011 --> 02:45:46.452]  My reception was kind of poor, and I missed a day or two.
[02:45:47.312 --> 02:45:50.254]  There was a man by the name of Dan Briody.
[02:45:50.994 --> 02:45:53.875]  He wrote a book called The Iron Triangle.
[02:45:54.235 --> 02:45:55.275]  I don't know if you heard about it.
[02:45:55.355 --> 02:45:55.876]  Yeah, I have.
[02:45:56.056 --> 02:45:58.557]  It's inside the secret world of the Carlyle Group.
[02:45:58.637 --> 02:46:01.858]  I thought it was rather interesting that they had it on C-SPAN, and...
[02:46:02.714 --> 02:46:12.137]  Pretty powerful information he had about the powerful elite who were making money at the expense of war and what have you.
[02:46:12.157 --> 02:46:13.838]  Well, let me boil it down, and I appreciate the call, Myron.
[02:46:13.858 --> 02:46:16.279]  Let me boil it down exactly how Carlaw works, okay?
[02:46:16.319 --> 02:46:18.260]  It's real simple.
[02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:19.100]  It makes me real mad.
[02:46:19.580 --> 02:46:22.141]  They manufacture absolutely nothing.
[02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:28.564]  But they have their people in key positions at the Pentagon, White House, in and out, no matter what administration.
[02:46:29.045 --> 02:46:36.150]  You want a broker deal, you as a defense contractor want to sell a weapon system, you've got to give at least a piece of it to Carlisle.
[02:46:36.530 --> 02:46:37.851]  They'll pull the strings and you get it.
[02:46:37.892 --> 02:46:38.872]  They're a brokerage house.
[02:46:39.753 --> 02:46:47.859]  They've gone from the 10th largest to arguably in the top three, probably the largest defense broker in the world, hundreds of billions a year now, since 9-1-1.
[02:46:50.376 --> 02:46:51.337]  And they've taken that money.
[02:46:51.357 --> 02:46:54.298]  They bought Universal Studios, which owns a bunch of the cable channels.
[02:46:55.659 --> 02:46:57.520]  And they're buying up everything.
[02:46:57.540 --> 02:47:00.802]  They're trying to buy up radio networks, TV networks.
[02:47:00.862 --> 02:47:02.823]  They own one of the biggest radio networks, part of it.
[02:47:03.483 --> 02:47:05.545]  These are very, very, very serious people.
[02:47:07.005 --> 02:47:09.687]  And they are the equivalent of mob chieftains.
[02:47:09.747 --> 02:47:12.088]  I mean, you've seen it in all the news, what the stuff they're involved in.
[02:47:12.128 --> 02:47:16.751]  BCCI, it's one of the most shadowy, dangerous weapons dealers, smugglers around.
[02:47:17.723 --> 02:47:18.364]  ...have been members.
[02:47:18.444 --> 02:47:21.546]  I mean, this is a cunning group of ultra-evil.
[02:47:22.347 --> 02:47:23.728]  Real quick, Mark in Florida.
[02:47:23.768 --> 02:47:24.729]  Go ahead, last caller.
[02:47:26.891 --> 02:47:29.913]  I'm about the railroad, chipping them off with trains.
[02:47:31.154 --> 02:47:31.595]  You know what?
[02:47:31.715 --> 02:47:37.239]  I got running around, and we were downloading like 500 emails, and I didn't download on time.
[02:47:37.279 --> 02:47:38.080]  I'll have that tomorrow.
[02:47:38.420 --> 02:47:44.245]  Oh, well, I would like that, yeah, because I saw an article or a website months ago
[02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:52.885]  And it was about concentration camps, and then I went to another page on prison rail cars that the government started having manufactured in 1985.
[02:47:52.925 --> 02:47:54.727]  Yeah, it's all car safety.
[02:47:54.767 --> 02:47:56.948]  Yeah, everything in 85, Rex 84.
[02:47:57.409 --> 02:47:59.730]  I've got the Senate hearings where they admit giant FEMA camps.
[02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:05.054]  They've been planning what they're doing now for decades, saying they'd use terror to get total control.
[02:48:05.314 --> 02:48:06.095]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:48:06.215 --> 02:48:06.915]  I've got to jump, Mark.
[02:48:06.955 --> 02:48:07.395]  I'm sorry.
[02:48:07.435 --> 02:48:10.317]  Call me back tomorrow, back tonight, 9 to midnight, and I'll talk to you longer.
[02:48:10.337 --> 02:48:10.878]  I apologize.
[02:48:11.358 --> 02:48:11.999]  I'm out of time.
[02:48:12.039 --> 02:48:12.899]  Covered a lot of the news.
[02:48:12.919 --> 02:48:13.760]  Didn't cover some of it.
[02:48:14.180 --> 02:48:15.201]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:48:15.261 --> 02:48:16.843]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 during the day.
[02:48:17.943 --> 02:48:18.984]  Central Standard Time.
[02:48:19.265 --> 02:48:25.550]  If you want to find out about the biometrics, the thumb scanning that they now admit for everything, you better stop them.
[02:48:25.570 --> 02:48:27.311]  You better get America Destroyed by Design.
[02:48:27.331 --> 02:48:30.233]  You better get Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Takeover.

[02:48:49.366 --> 02:48:50.987]  A guy that loves freedom.
[02:48:51.007 --> 02:48:51.567]  What about you?

[02:49:16.029 --> 02:49:16.990]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.

[02:49:22.914 --> 02:49:23.775]  God bless you all.
[02:49:23.795 --> 02:49:26.156]  Now get out there and give Big Brother a broken nose.
[02:49:26.416 --> 02:49:28.238]  Energy production is always a problem.
[02:49:28.558 --> 02:49:33.581]  Did you know that every cell in your body depends on the nutrient coenzyme Q10 for energy production?
[02:49:33.862 --> 02:49:37.244]  The best coenzyme Q10 is available at LifeWise Live.
