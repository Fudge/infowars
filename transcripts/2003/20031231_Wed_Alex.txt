[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:00.629]  It's your family.
[00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:16.234]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:17.234]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.854 --> 00:00:18.935]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:20.795]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:22.235]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:23.736]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.163]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.703 --> 00:00:32.826]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.987 --> 00:00:34.728]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:37.310]  It is the 31st day of December 2003, the last day of 2003.
[00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.172]  We'll see you on the other side.
[00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:40.672]  Start of 04.
[00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:54.907]  We have a bunch of guests coming up today.
[00:00:54.987 --> 00:01:00.771]  We have a scientist, a doctor, coming on to talk about mad cow disease in about 30 minutes.
[00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:09.996]  Then we have Frank Morales, an expert on the police state and the martial law control grid, going in publicly, now publicly admitted.
[00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:17.700]  Then in the third hour, we have Colonel Craig Roberts and, of course, Jack McClam joining us, because I had him on last week.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.262]  We ran out of time and there was a lot of information we didn't have time to cover.
[00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:24.865]  That's four of our guests.
[00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:28.768]  We have another little surprise guest coming up as well.
[00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.309]  A strong finish for the year 2003.
[00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:40.776]  There is so much news today on top of the fact that I set up all these guests.
[00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:42.817]  I've got to cover this news.
[00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:49.202]  Richard Perl has put out a new PNAC style dossier, a book,
[00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:55.002]  His nickname is the Prince of Darkness at the Pentagon.
[00:01:56.343 --> 00:02:00.404]  And he wants to go ahead and perhaps even attack France.
[00:02:02.284 --> 00:02:04.865]  And he has a battle plan for total war.
[00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:07.786]  The National Draft, all of it.
[00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.107]  I have an article on this.
[00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:15.568]  Also, we have a Mr. Sapphire coming out.
[00:02:15.608 --> 00:02:18.329]  William Sapphire in the New York Times with his predictions
[00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:21.518]  And there are 16 of them.
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.924]  Just one of them, 13, has four predictions.
[00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:40.536]  One of them, the capture of Bin Laden in Yemen, the daring escape of Saddam, a major terror attack in the U.S., finding a buried bag of anthrax in Tikrit.
[00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:46.572]  And he brags that, hey, I predicted a bunch of stuff last year.
[00:02:46.592 --> 00:02:48.252]  Yeah, we know you can predict it.
[00:02:48.312 --> 00:02:51.634]  It's like a bank robber predicting what bank's going to be robbed.
[00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:52.675]  Okay?
[00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:56.297]  It's like Hitler predicting that he's going to kill a bunch of Jews.
[00:02:57.837 --> 00:03:08.023]  It's not very hard for you, is it, Mr. Well, you have the birthright, according to mainstream news and Congressman Ron Paul, of the Communist Fourth International.
[00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:16.058]  But again, you call yourself a conservative when you publicly aren't admitted head of the Communist Fourth International.
[00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.420]  I know that sounds insane.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.361]  It's mainstream news.
[00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:24.466]  I couldn't believe it when I discovered it three years ago, and now it's been all over the news.
[00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:25.807]  We'll get into that.
[00:03:27.128 --> 00:03:37.937]  Richard Perle, chief neocon, one of his other chief neocons, William Sapphire, amazing statements, disgusting activities, big time.
[00:03:38.991 --> 00:03:42.593]  So, that's coming up here on the show.
[00:03:42.613 --> 00:03:47.976]  There's a lot of new terror alerts, and other terror alerts have turned out to be false as usual.
[00:03:48.716 --> 00:03:50.517]  We'll get to that.
[00:03:51.578 --> 00:03:52.638]  There is just so much here.
[00:03:52.658 --> 00:04:01.463]  I have an article about illegal aerosol vaccines, and it says Maxigen,
[00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:09.946]  Our GN announces 6.5 million grant from DARPA to develop aerosol vaccines to spray from aircraft on you.
[00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:17.331]  If they can't force you to take their poisons, they'll just spray them on you, and I admit that's what this is all for.
[00:04:18.352 --> 00:04:24.156]  They're now saying that, ooh, Syria sold weapons to Saddam, so that invasion needs to begin.
[00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:28.039]  A lot of key info.
[00:04:29.153 --> 00:04:32.076]  Coming up here on the show today.
[00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:35.639]  So you do not want to miss the broadcast when we get back.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.981]  I'll go straight into the news.
[00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:42.385]  The New American's finally reporting about the stealth enactment of Patriot Act II.
[00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:43.226]  U.S.
[00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:51.794]  population rises to 292 plus million with an illegal alien coming into the country every 25 seconds, according to the Associated Press.
[00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:57.211]  And Bush wants total amnesty to legalize anybody who can get their feet on our shores.
[00:04:57.231 --> 00:05:01.134]  The USDA calls for implantable microchips in all farm animals.
[00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:02.716]  We told you that was coming.
[00:05:04.177 --> 00:05:05.158]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:05.258 --> 00:05:05.879]  Big show.
[00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.001]  Infowars.com.
[00:05:08.121 --> 00:05:09.362]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:09.382 --> 00:05:09.823]  Stay with us.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.165]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:20.771]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:25.317]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:25.357 --> 00:05:26.678]  The New World Order.
[00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:32.728]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:39.719]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.843]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:52.561]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:58.205]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:06:17.488 --> 00:06:21.571]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:22.412]  We listened.
[00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:27.715]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:27.975 --> 00:06:28.476]  We listened.
[00:06:28.856 --> 00:06:31.898]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:32.318 --> 00:06:32.858]  We listened.
[00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.461]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:37.021]  I don't know.

[00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:17.224]  Big Brother.
[00:08:17.884 --> 00:08:18.925]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:19.645 --> 00:08:20.746]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:21.406 --> 00:08:22.226]  You want answers?
[00:08:22.987 --> 00:08:23.927]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:24.568 --> 00:08:28.289]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.071]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:32.817]  Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:55.523]  Before I dive into all the news and our four guests that we have coming up today, this final broadcast of 2003 for yours truly,
[00:09:00.052 --> 00:09:10.580]  I was talking to one of my friends who I've known for several years who works in a mid-level management capacity for one of the major airlines here in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:18.505]  And he said that he sat there for an hour watching local News 8.
[00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:23.067]  And by the way, News 8 is Time Warner Cable.
[00:09:23.087 --> 00:09:23.748]  That's what they have.
[00:09:23.808 --> 00:09:26.569]  It's a local Time Warner 24-hour news channel.
[00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:32.552]  That's what they have on in the airport here in Austin at the Bergstrom International Airport.
[00:09:33.252 --> 00:09:41.636]  He sat there and watched a reporter with a cameraman for an hour interview over 40 people.
[00:09:41.676 --> 00:09:42.977]  They sat there counting them.
[00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:53.532]  Every person was against the heightened security, against being harassed, against taking their shoes off, having some illegal alien reach in their bags.
[00:09:56.114 --> 00:10:00.237]  And by the way, the majority of people in the airports are not even citizens and that's been in the news.
[00:10:01.398 --> 00:10:07.062]  And there was finally one old lady after 40 plus people who said, I love it, I think it's great.
[00:10:07.963 --> 00:10:13.287]  Then they turned on the news a few hours later and there she was all weekend long
[00:10:13.993 --> 00:10:18.135]  Through the holiday, saying, I love the added security.
[00:10:18.816 --> 00:10:19.656]  I think it's great.
[00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:22.238]  And they said on the news that everybody loves it.
[00:10:23.718 --> 00:10:30.242]  Now is that not an example of the crafting, the twisting of public perception?
[00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:35.985]  80 plus percent of the American people, including Hispanics, are against the open borders and all these illegals.
[00:10:37.726 --> 00:10:42.149]  But Bush comes out and says, I'm going to legalize anybody that can get here because I want votes.
[00:10:42.836 --> 00:10:43.416]  They said that.
[00:10:43.497 --> 00:10:49.281]  Oh, it's politically positive in the Washington Post with Bush's advisor's quotes in there.
[00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:58.627]  The vast majority of us want the borders shut, illegals expelled, but the government says, oh no, you want it open!
[00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:03.031]  And it's like this across the board.
[00:11:05.412 --> 00:11:08.815]  So, think about that long and hard, folks.
[00:11:11.075 --> 00:11:13.716]  Think about that long and hard.
[00:11:14.836 --> 00:11:34.100]  That I have a friend who works at the airport and he watches 40 plus people get interviewed who are all against the phony baloney security in the police state making comments along those lines and then they get one old lady who loves it and she's on the news over and over again for three days.
[00:11:38.669 --> 00:11:48.799]  She was the first person who agreed with it, the last person, because they had to go through 40 plus people until they found her, and as soon as she was done, they shut the camera off and left the airport.
[00:11:51.201 --> 00:11:54.044]  And it's going on all over the country.
[00:11:55.245 --> 00:12:00.730]  That's the type of propaganda and news crafting locally.
[00:12:00.811 --> 00:12:03.333]  It's even worse nationally.
[00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:20.646]  It's clear that they were sent out there to find someone who agreed with it and thought it was great to put a positive light on it.
[00:12:22.747 --> 00:12:26.229]  So that's deception by selective reporting.
[00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:34.594]  Alright, coming up today we have a doctor, professor, who is against the
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.465]  Way the Food and Drug Administration handles downer cows.
[00:12:41.506 --> 00:12:44.309]  We'll talk about mad cow disease for about 15 minutes.
[00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:47.773]  That's coming up here in about 15-20 minutes.
[00:12:48.354 --> 00:12:56.944]  Then we've got Frank Morales, police state expert, about the public announcements of the martial law system we're going into that he's been warning people about for years.
[00:12:58.608 --> 00:13:05.150]  Then we have Colonel Craig Roberts and Jack McClam coming on the third hour because we ran out of time with them last week.
[00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.791]  And we're going to have open phones, of course.
[00:13:08.011 --> 00:13:12.752]  The total free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231 and the website is www.infowars.com.
[00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:26.847]  Let's jump right in to the news.
[00:13:27.147 --> 00:13:27.507]  U.S.
[00:13:27.567 --> 00:13:30.489]  has new concerns about anthrax readiness.
[00:13:30.549 --> 00:13:33.812]  And they go into how Al-Qaeda is about to attack us with anthrax any minute.
[00:13:34.632 --> 00:13:40.716]  Why was Bush on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic, on September 10th with his cabinet?
[00:13:40.756 --> 00:13:41.397]  That's admitted.
[00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:44.299]  And then it turns out it's the most weaponized anthrax ever seen.
[00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:45.180]  U.S.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.161]  patented, coded in bentonite.
[00:13:49.082 --> 00:13:50.784]  And that story has just left the headlines.
[00:13:52.485 --> 00:13:53.986]  Then we have an article here.
[00:13:55.425 --> 00:14:06.312]  By a Maxigen announcement by the company, a $6.7 million grant from DARPA to develop aerosolized vaccines.
[00:14:06.472 --> 00:14:07.833]  Redwood City, California.
[00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:22.482]  Maxigen announced today that it has received a $6.7 million three-year grant from the Defense Advanced Research Agency, or DARPA, to use its proprietary molecular breeding
[00:14:23.868 --> 00:14:33.350]  Directed Evolution Technology, also known as DNA Shuffling, to develop aerosol-based vaccines to protect against a broad spectrum of pathogens.
[00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:46.473]  They've also been given a $7.7 million fund from DARPA in the past, along with another $5.6 million DARPA funding years ago.
[00:14:46.593 --> 00:14:48.273]  So, it's a long-term program.
[00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:53.883]  And it is studying the genomes and creating all of this.
[00:14:53.923 --> 00:14:57.208]  That really should concern you.
[00:15:00.472 --> 00:15:08.042]  DARPA's the folks that had the betting scheme, betting, betting on
[00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:14.103]  How many troops would die or where we'll have terror attacks where you could go bet on the stock.
[00:15:14.143 --> 00:15:17.784]  Of course, then those with inside knowledge could reap huge insider trading benefits.
[00:15:18.184 --> 00:15:21.646]  Oh, like the CIA did on 9-11 that no one wants to talk about.
[00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:22.206]  Oh, okay.
[00:15:22.686 --> 00:15:26.668]  The same folks that have the Total Information Awareness Network under new names like Matrix.
[00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:33.591]  They are funding folks for the aerosolized sprays, which they already have, folks.
[00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:36.572]  Congressman urges avoiding Times Square.
[00:15:38.157 --> 00:15:47.584]  Concerned about terrorism, Representative Christopher Shays urged revelers not to attend New Year's Eve celebrations like the one at Times Square this year.
[00:15:48.045 --> 00:15:53.029]  New York's mayor countered that Shays could use an infusion of courage.
[00:15:53.089 --> 00:15:55.651]  Well, I don't want to be shoved around by people in black ski masks.
[00:15:56.443 --> 00:15:57.565]  So I'm not going to go anywhere.
[00:15:58.026 --> 00:16:09.066]  A member of the House Select Committee on Homeland Security and Chairman of the Terrorism Subcommittee, the Connecticut Republican told WVIT-TV on Tuesday that he wouldn't go to Times Square for anything.
[00:16:10.166 --> 00:16:22.075]  New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said nobody should stay home because of the nation's hyphen terror alert and Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge of the nation's security was unprecedented.
[00:16:22.695 --> 00:16:34.684]  Yeah, there's a CNN photo out of one of the black Blackhawk helicopters with a guy in a black ski mask, black helmet, pointing an automatic machine gun mounted out the door over the Statue of Liberty.
[00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:37.174]  Has nothing to do with stopping terrorists.
[00:16:37.234 --> 00:16:44.257]  It's training you, cameras, police, riot gear, machine guns, helicopters, drones, surveillance blimps.
[00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:49.820]  Like something out of a police state science fiction movie, The Running Man.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.241]  With Mad Dog Ben Richards up there.
[00:16:54.542 --> 00:17:04.987]  And then there's these chilling statements here by William Sapphire, whose father was publicly the head of the 4th Communist International, the heir to Trotsky,
[00:17:06.187 --> 00:17:12.588]  And this is Ron Paul, this is the, uh, major newspapers admitting, quote, the ghost of Trotsky walks the halls of the White House.
[00:17:13.268 --> 00:17:14.789]  They believe in command and control.
[00:17:15.649 --> 00:17:21.670]  And he makes his predictions, uh, to, uh, what's gonna happen, the next tyranny to feel the force of the U.S.
[00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.271]  liberation, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Venezuela.
[00:17:26.131 --> 00:17:27.471]  Oh, Venezuela needs to be invaded.
[00:17:28.832 --> 00:17:32.672]  Uh, and, um, Iraq will split up like gold.
[00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:34.433]  Ah, you're Caesar.
[00:17:34.513 --> 00:17:35.733]  You know, most people won't know that.
[00:17:36.425 --> 00:17:37.405]  Into three parts.
[00:17:37.605 --> 00:17:39.366]  Defeat the insurgents that emerge.
[00:17:39.986 --> 00:17:41.707]  A rudimentary democracy.
[00:17:43.167 --> 00:17:46.609]  And then he says, succumb to a Sunni coup.
[00:17:47.089 --> 00:17:50.010]  You ought to read this New York Times predictions by Sapphire.
[00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.470]  It's got the inside travel.
[00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.891]  They predicted lots of stuff.
[00:17:53.871 --> 00:17:57.012]  And down here, number 13 is the most chilling prediction.
[00:17:57.433 --> 00:17:58.493]  Set of predictions.
[00:17:59.033 --> 00:18:03.915]  The October surprise affecting our election will be the capture of Bin Laden in Yemen.
[00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.131]  And now they're all starting to say that.
[00:18:07.491 --> 00:18:15.676]  The daring escape of Saddam, a major terror attack in the U.S., finding a buried bag of anthrax in Tikrit.
[00:18:18.717 --> 00:18:29.103]  And, uh, it says debating Cheney on TV will be Democratic running mate Wesley Clark, Bob Graham, Bill Richardson, Dianne Feinstein, John Edwards, R-11, whatever that means.
[00:18:30.284 --> 00:18:34.746]  The next Secretary of State will be Richard Holbrook, Paul Bremer, Donald Rumsfeld, John Kerry.
[00:18:35.683 --> 00:18:39.405]  And it says, uh, Israel, staunchly supported during the U.S.
[00:18:39.465 --> 00:18:46.349]  election year, will build its security barrier, including an aerial, uh, salient in the Jordan Valley.
[00:18:46.569 --> 00:18:55.374]  And, uh, undermine Arafat will be negotiating territory with Syria after Assad squads, uh, quiet Hezbollah in occupied Lebanon.
[00:18:55.394 --> 00:18:58.276]  It goes on and on, folks.
[00:18:58.456 --> 00:18:59.537]  Really bizarre stuff.
[00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:02.899]  And then we've got, uh, Richard Perle's new book.
[00:19:03.499 --> 00:19:04.840]  Another chief neocon.
[00:19:06.042 --> 00:19:09.026]  And Hawks tell Bush how to win war on terror.
[00:19:10.148 --> 00:19:12.311]  France may need to be attacked.
[00:19:12.371 --> 00:19:13.312]  They may be an enemy.
[00:19:15.916 --> 00:19:16.777]  Okay.
[00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.460]  Alrighty then.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.544]  So, World War III on this front.
[00:19:21.584 --> 00:19:22.906]  We'll cover that when we get back.
[00:19:23.689 --> 00:19:25.350]  Both Korea fears surprise attack.
[00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.171]  Syria sold weapons to Saddam.
[00:19:27.211 --> 00:19:28.411]  Now they've got their pretext.
[00:19:28.931 --> 00:19:30.892]  Stealth implementation of Patriot Act 2.
[00:19:31.332 --> 00:19:33.033]  The John Birchers are now reporting on this.
[00:19:33.573 --> 00:19:33.773]  U.S.
[00:19:33.833 --> 00:19:36.735]  population rises to 292 plus mil.
[00:19:37.235 --> 00:19:40.396]  USDA calls for implanted chips to prevent mad cow outbreaks.
[00:19:40.716 --> 00:19:44.818]  Supreme Court takes another look at prison labor or new economy.
[00:19:45.479 --> 00:19:50.481]  Russian Secret Service seizes copies of book linking it to 99 bombings.
[00:19:52.782 --> 00:19:52.842]  Oh!
[00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:57.979]  Seizing books that expose Putin for carrying out bombings to get control.
[00:19:58.339 --> 00:20:01.641]  Ex-general to oversee Guantanamo trials, if you can call them that.
[00:20:02.542 --> 00:20:04.524]  False TNT alarm hits airport.
[00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:06.605]  It's all coming up.
[00:20:06.765 --> 00:20:09.067]  Gigantic final year show.
[00:20:09.127 --> 00:20:09.767]  We'll be back.
[00:20:09.827 --> 00:20:10.528]  Final day of the year.
[00:20:12.216 --> 00:20:16.098]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:20:16.338 --> 00:20:28.603]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:20:29.043 --> 00:20:29.443]  The U.S.
[00:20:29.483 --> 00:20:35.045]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:20:35.466 --> 00:20:37.666]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:20:39.542 --> 00:20:40.602]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:20:40.642 --> 00:20:43.463]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:20:43.583 --> 00:20:49.604]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:53.385]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:20:53.465 --> 00:20:59.846]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:21:00.387 --> 00:21:04.387]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:04.507 --> 00:21:04.767]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:07.458 --> 00:21:07.741]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:12.847 --> 00:21:15.068]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:21:15.488 --> 00:21:19.849]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:21:20.129 --> 00:21:25.930]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.211]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:21:30.511 --> 00:21:36.133]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:38.874]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.513]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[00:21:44.613 --> 00:21:47.295]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:21:47.635 --> 00:21:49.937]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:21:50.337 --> 00:21:53.960]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:22:00.624]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:22:01.085 --> 00:22:02.046]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:22:02.066 --> 00:22:02.726]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.746 --> 00:22:02.926]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:11.627 --> 00:22:16.851]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:22:16.991 --> 00:22:25.097]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:22:25.358 --> 00:22:32.403]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:22:32.583 --> 00:22:39.825]  Radioactive Poisoning Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:45.106]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:22:45.226 --> 00:22:51.768]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children
[00:22:52.068 --> 00:22:57.869]  Have you found your business isn't quite as profitable as it was before the economy went south?
[00:22:57.889 --> 00:23:00.250]  Are new clients a little harder to come by lately?
[00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.230]  Well, maybe we can help!

[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.043]  Call GCN today and get more customers tomorrow.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.840]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:19.321 --> 00:24:22.141]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:26.302 --> 00:24:29.083]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[00:24:29.163 --> 00:24:30.303]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[00:24:30.323 --> 00:24:31.163]  I'm here live.
[00:24:31.943 --> 00:24:33.064]  Central Standard Time.
[00:24:33.624 --> 00:24:34.824]  Wow!
[00:24:35.224 --> 00:24:36.404]  2003 almost over.
[00:24:38.885 --> 00:24:42.846]  About to be eclipsed by 04, which we start tomorrow.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.461]  And boys, it's been quite a year.
[00:24:46.481 --> 00:24:47.902]  One of the worst years in U.S.
[00:24:47.922 --> 00:24:56.747]  history for freedom and liberty and our families and our sovereignty and the borders and trade deals destroying our economic base.
[00:24:56.787 --> 00:25:02.290]  But at the same time, a lot of people are waking up to the cold, hard facts of the New World Order.
[00:25:03.731 --> 00:25:08.493]  But in the new year, William Shafir says they're going to find the anthrax and pin it on Iraq.
[00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:10.835]  They're going to capture Bin Laden.
[00:25:12.887 --> 00:25:14.489]  What a nice little neocon.
[00:25:14.609 --> 00:25:16.270]  Here's another chief neocon.
[00:25:16.591 --> 00:25:20.114]  Hawks tell Bush how to win war on terror.
[00:25:20.915 --> 00:25:37.891]  President George W. Bush was sent a public manifesto yesterday by Washington's Hawks, just like PENAC did, written by the same people, demanding regime change in Syria and Iran and Cuba-style military blockade of North Korea.
[00:25:39.068 --> 00:25:42.692]  Backed by planning for a preemptive strike on its nuclear sites.
[00:25:43.773 --> 00:25:58.749]  The manifesto, presented as a manual for victory is what it's called, or the title, is the war on terror also calls for Saudi Arabia and France to be treated not as allies but as rivals and possibly enemies.
[00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:00.471]  The manifesto
[00:26:02.757 --> 00:26:15.680]  ...is contained in a new book by Richard Perle, a Pentagon advisor and intellectual guru of the hardline neoconservative movement, which believes in taxation, regulation, gun control, open borders, out-Clinton and Clinton.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:24.721]  And debuted from a former Bush speechwriter, they give warning of a faltering of will to win in Washington.
[00:26:26.602 --> 00:26:28.302]  To win, that means destroying your freedom.
[00:26:29.306 --> 00:26:48.178]  In the Bible for the Presidencier, the manifesto represents an attempt by hawks to break out of the post-Iraq doldrums and strike back at what they see as a campaign of hostile leaking by their foes in such centers of caution as the State Department or in the military top brass.
[00:26:48.539 --> 00:26:49.839]  That's totally staged.
[00:26:49.859 --> 00:26:52.141]  The military top brass are all CFR.
[00:26:53.055 --> 00:27:01.642]  The State Department plays the left-leaning side of the false paradigm, the kinder, gentler New World Order.
[00:27:02.182 --> 00:27:04.124]  Got Colin Powell in there, folks.
[00:27:04.684 --> 00:27:16.213]  Their publication, An End to Evil, oh, How to Win the War on Terror, coincided with the latest broadside from the Hawks' enemy number one, Colin Powell, the Secretary of State.
[00:27:16.753 --> 00:27:18.314]  Oh yeah, he's enemy number one.
[00:27:18.354 --> 00:27:19.015]  Give me a break.
[00:27:20.569 --> 00:27:34.340]  Though on leave, recovering from a prostate cancer operation, Mr. Powell summoned reporters to his bedside to hail encouraging signs of new attitude in Iran and a call for the United States to keep open the prospect of dialogue with the Tehran authorities.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.921]  Now, what did he do with Iraq?
[00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:39.163]  He said, it's not good, we shouldn't attack them.
[00:27:39.664 --> 00:27:42.886]  And then he goes before the UN and says, I was wrong, we've got to attack.
[00:27:42.926 --> 00:27:45.568]  Everybody goes, even the dove is for it now.
[00:27:47.409 --> 00:27:52.113]  He has the secret weapons dossier just released by MI6 he held up.
[00:27:52.473 --> 00:27:58.058]  Yeah, a fake document written 12 years ago by a graduate student.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:09.328]  Such talk is anathema to hawks like Mr. Pearl and Mr. Fromm who urge Washington to shun the mullahs and work for their overthrow in concert with Iranian dissidents.
[00:28:12.674 --> 00:28:24.061]  So again, for the history books, they're already preparing to blame it on Rumsfeld and Perl and Crystal and the rest of them, when it's the military-industrial complex and the big banks that are behind it from the beginning.
[00:28:25.842 --> 00:28:33.406]  I mean, you've got Brzezinski, the founder of the Trilateral Commission, writing in 1997 the exact words that are in PENAC documents.
[00:28:33.566 --> 00:28:34.647]  It's all the same thing.
[00:28:34.907 --> 00:28:35.927]  He's a Democrat!
[00:28:36.668 --> 00:28:40.190]  We've got all these Democrats, Hillary Clinton calling to attack all these people.
[00:28:41.465 --> 00:28:42.486]  There's no difference.
[00:28:44.587 --> 00:28:46.528]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:52.212]  We're going to break here in a minute or so, and when we get back, we've got a guest coming on.
[00:28:52.812 --> 00:28:57.495]  Again, one of four guests that are going to be on the show.
[00:28:57.515 --> 00:29:07.862]  We'll be talking about mad cow disease and the police state with Frank Morales, Colonel Craig Roberts, Jack McClain, and others in the second and third hour, and of course, your calls.
[00:29:07.882 --> 00:29:09.163]  And there's so much other news.
[00:29:09.773 --> 00:29:11.935]  They're now saying Syria sold weapons to Saddam.
[00:29:12.335 --> 00:29:13.416]  They need to be invaded.
[00:29:14.837 --> 00:29:15.838]  They've got the draft.
[00:29:16.198 --> 00:29:18.660]  More information on the draft now coming out.
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.903]  They want to put chips on all farm animals and federally control and regulate.
[00:29:22.923 --> 00:29:25.225]  Which is absolutely not needed.
[00:29:25.245 --> 00:29:28.448]  You need to ban feeding dead meat to cows.
[00:29:28.728 --> 00:29:29.769]  Rotten meat to cows.
[00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:31.430]  That would fix the problem.
[00:29:32.111 --> 00:29:37.135]  That's coming up as well and just a stack of other vitally important news.
[00:29:38.812 --> 00:29:47.476]  But as you watch the television broadcast, just look at all the ski masks, all the black helmets, all the machine guns in your cities, the troops, selling you tyranny.
[00:29:48.337 --> 00:29:50.838]  Selling you something that looks like East Germany.
[00:29:51.758 --> 00:29:52.559]  As if it's freedom.
[00:29:53.799 --> 00:29:55.500]  Alright, we got two and a half hours left.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.141]  It's gonna be totally jam-packed.
[00:29:57.841 --> 00:30:00.282]  Strap yourselves in, lock yourselves in, stay the course.
[00:30:00.302 --> 00:30:00.843]  We'll be back.
[00:30:02.523 --> 00:30:03.444]  We're on the march.
[00:30:03.924 --> 00:30:05.425]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:06.452 --> 00:30:09.146]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:12.677 --> 00:30:16.218]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:30:16.539 --> 00:30:16.879]  Yes.
[00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:19.540]  Wheatgrass Juice is live superfood.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.961]  The richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[00:30:22.101 --> 00:30:31.025]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, 2 ounces of juice have the same nutrition as 3 pounds of choice garden produce.
[00:30:31.165 --> 00:30:38.808]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[00:30:39.088 --> 00:30:41.350]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:48.714]  The 200 pages of our book, Wheatgrass, Nature's Finest Medicine, will remove any anxieties you may have about your nutritional supply.
[00:30:48.854 --> 00:30:52.557]  In this kit, you will receive no monthly bills, no monthly pills.
[00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:54.338]  This is real self-sufficiency.
[00:30:54.438 --> 00:31:04.104]  To get more information about Wheatgrass, the book, seed, and the beautiful stainless steel wheatgrass juicer, go to austinwheatgrass.com or call toll-free 1-877-MY-WHEAT.
[00:31:06.165 --> 00:31:09.327]  Thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[00:31:11.748 --> 00:31:17.951]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:31:18.412 --> 00:31:26.176]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:31:26.536 --> 00:31:32.119]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:31:32.443 --> 00:31:34.383]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:31:34.703 --> 00:31:39.444]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:31:39.784 --> 00:31:44.485]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:31:45.005 --> 00:31:48.866]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:31:49.346 --> 00:31:50.366]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:31:50.446 --> 00:31:54.527]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:31:54.947 --> 00:31:56.347]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:31:59.853 --> 00:32:02.396]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:32:02.837 --> 00:32:04.499]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:04.619 --> 00:32:04.839]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:10.911 --> 00:32:13.852]  Americans get the IRS off your back legally.
[00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:16.993]  Discover the secret the IRS is terrified you'll learn.
[00:32:17.234 --> 00:32:20.515]  You probably owe no federal income tax and never have.
[00:32:20.875 --> 00:32:27.998]  The IRS itself admits that millions and millions of Americans already have learned the truth and have dropped out of the system and so can you.
[00:32:28.198 --> 00:32:38.322]  The federal courts and even the US Supreme Court have verified that the reward for your labor, wages, salaries and compensation for personal services is not and never has been taxable.
[00:32:38.702 --> 00:32:47.908]  In fact, the Supreme Court ruled over 106 years ago that such attacks imposed by the federal government on the citizens of the states would be unconstitutional and illegal.
[00:32:48.208 --> 00:32:49.929]  I know this sounds crazy and scary.
[00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:53.131]  You've been carefully trained by government propaganda for decades.
[00:32:53.291 --> 00:32:55.232]  But especially today with a tough economy,
[00:32:55.632 --> 00:33:02.274]  Why would you let the government continue to illegally grab money from you when there's a simple, proven, and legal way to keep it all yourself?
[00:33:02.594 --> 00:33:07.355]  To get the details and learn the truth, get on the internet and go to federaltax.net.
[00:33:07.495 --> 00:33:09.435]  That's federaltax.net.
[00:33:09.575 --> 00:33:10.155]  Do it today.
[00:33:33.083 --> 00:33:38.046]  All right, my friends, it is the 31st of December, 2003, final show of the year.
[00:33:38.066 --> 00:33:42.549]  We do have Frank Morales, police state expert, coming on the next hour.
[00:33:42.569 --> 00:33:48.733]  Then in the third hour, Jack McClam, police against the New World Order, and Colonel Craig Roberts.
[00:33:48.753 --> 00:33:52.355]  You don't want to miss this show, and we'll open the phones up in the next hour.
[00:33:52.375 --> 00:33:55.997]  In fact, we'll open them up right now on Mad Cow Disease if you want to get involved on air.
[00:33:56.518 --> 00:33:56.718]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:13.084]  Dr. Michael Greger, MD, is the Chief BSE Investigator for Farm Sanctuary and Mad Cow Coordinator for the Organic Consumers Association.
[00:34:13.444 --> 00:34:17.646]  Dr. Greger has been speaking publicly about mad cow disease since 1993.
[00:34:18.106 --> 00:34:26.870]  He has debated the National Cattlemen's Beef Association before the FDA and was invited as an expert witness on the Oprah Winfrey infamous meat
[00:34:27.706 --> 00:34:56.413]  uh... defamation trial he has contributed to many books and articles on the subject continues to lecture extensively and uh... currently runs the top rated mad cow disease website and uh... that's organic consumers dot org forward slash mad cow dot htm dr greger is a graduate of the cornell university school of agriculture and the tufts university school of medicine and uh... he's written article usda misleading american public about beef safety
[00:34:57.398 --> 00:35:00.601]  And I've read a lot of his warnings over the last five years.
[00:35:00.641 --> 00:35:01.822]  They've been very accurate.
[00:35:02.223 --> 00:35:14.495]  So we've got Dr. Michael Greger on the show to give us the real skinning on what's going on with BSC and how that affects the food supply and the economy.
[00:35:15.155 --> 00:35:16.617]  Dr. Greger, thanks for coming on.
[00:35:17.157 --> 00:35:17.638]  Good morning.
[00:35:17.658 --> 00:35:18.238]  Thanks for having me.
[00:35:18.759 --> 00:35:19.199]  You bet.
[00:35:22.777 --> 00:35:25.458]  I've seen other stories of Mad Cow in the country.
[00:35:25.478 --> 00:35:27.018]  Then they say, oh false alarm.
[00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:29.919]  We know all these new deaths in Creutzfeldt-Jacobs.
[00:35:29.959 --> 00:35:34.320]  A lot of that they say isn't connected to meat.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.621]  But why is it then going up?
[00:35:37.441 --> 00:35:43.823]  Exploding in its numbers from very rare to now still being rare but a lot more common in the numbers.
[00:35:44.483 --> 00:35:45.463]  What's really going on?
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:57.224]  Well, unfortunately, a lot of these human spongiform encephalopathies or human sponge-like brain diseases caused by these prions are misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease.
[00:35:57.744 --> 00:36:02.626]  Alzheimer's disease is now the eighth leading cause of death according to the Centers for Disease Control.
[00:36:03.046 --> 00:36:09.549]  In many of these cases, a significant minority may indeed be Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
[00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:15.651]  And Alzheimer's, I mean, there's people who are 30 years old getting Alzheimer's now.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.822]  Well, unfortunately, we've had a number of cases.
[00:36:19.422 --> 00:36:28.349]  Literally in the last five years, the cases of young people, people under 30, dying of these Alzheimer's-like diseases has quintupled.
[00:36:28.389 --> 00:36:31.872]  And that's really a concern compared to what we've seen over the last 20 years.
[00:36:32.513 --> 00:36:34.935]  Now, it's possible we're just looking harder for the disease.
[00:36:34.995 --> 00:36:39.739]  Now that we're worried about it, it's also possible that it's going through the roof.
[00:36:39.779 --> 00:36:43.582]  And we wouldn't know because there isn't mandatory reporting by the CDC.
[00:36:44.252 --> 00:36:52.898]  So unfortunately, we're not seeing, we don't, you know, a doctor has it somewhere, a person dies, gets buried, and no one knows about it.
[00:36:52.938 --> 00:36:58.642]  So we haven't been testing the cattle, we haven't been testing the feed, we haven't been testing the people.
[00:37:00.744 --> 00:37:03.066]  Well, you've been warning people for years.
[00:37:03.526 --> 00:37:07.949]  Doctor, from your studies, do you think this is really the first case of a mad cow herd?
[00:37:07.989 --> 00:37:13.273]  I mean, now it's over 80 animals, they're saying, running around with this, or who may have been butchered.
[00:37:14.403 --> 00:37:20.987]  I've been talking about this since 1993, and we've been warning about this for over a decade now.
[00:37:21.427 --> 00:37:24.809]  It's not that this is the first mad cow case in the United States.
[00:37:24.869 --> 00:37:27.550]  It's the first mad cow case that we have found.
[00:37:28.151 --> 00:37:33.934]  Obviously, finding a case is a function of how hard one looks for a case.
[00:37:33.974 --> 00:37:37.756]  And unfortunately, we've had a grossly inadequate surveillance testing system here.
[00:37:38.176 --> 00:37:42.018]  Basically, over the last 10 years, tested only about 57,000 animals out of the
[00:37:43.686 --> 00:37:46.907]  Hundreds of millions that we've slaughtered during this period.
[00:37:47.408 --> 00:37:54.370]  In Europe, they test as many cows as we do, you know, every week they test as many as we've done in our entire history.
[00:37:55.271 --> 00:37:57.732]  In Japan, they test every single cow for the disease.
[00:37:57.772 --> 00:37:59.572]  In Europe, they test one out of every four.
[00:38:00.053 --> 00:38:01.413]  We're doing about one out of every 2,000.
[00:38:01.513 --> 00:38:08.396]  We don't know, we won't know the extent of this crisis until we start doing universal testing.
[00:38:09.292 --> 00:38:14.376]  Now, down here in Texas, most of the cows are raised open range.
[00:38:14.416 --> 00:38:16.338]  You want to do that because you don't have to pay for the feed.
[00:38:16.378 --> 00:38:26.966]  There's plenty of acres per animal, but in a lot of areas of the country, they have these feedlots and they're still putting in the bone meal, the blood products.
[00:38:28.167 --> 00:38:29.368]  How widespread is this?
[00:38:30.389 --> 00:38:33.591]  It's a very widespread practice, unfortunately, and it was not banned back in 1997.
[00:38:33.712 --> 00:38:34.452]  All that back in 1997
[00:38:38.484 --> 00:38:42.968]  Was regulations that require the labeling of ruminants.
[00:38:43.068 --> 00:38:46.512]  Cow and sheep, meat and bone meal, do not feed to cows or other ruminants.
[00:38:46.672 --> 00:38:48.133]  There's a number of problems with that.
[00:38:48.193 --> 00:38:50.375]  First of all, you can still produce this stuff.
[00:38:50.395 --> 00:38:51.256]  You can still make it.
[00:38:51.276 --> 00:38:52.798]  It's still on the feed store shelves.
[00:38:52.858 --> 00:38:55.180]  Any farmer can walk into any feed store and still buy it.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:00.445]  No one asks them, wait a second, are you just feeding this to pigs and chickens?
[00:39:00.465 --> 00:39:01.746]  You're feeding this to cows too.
[00:39:02.467 --> 00:39:03.808]  If it's being sold,
[00:39:04.426 --> 00:39:06.067]  And it's cheaper, unfortunately.
[00:39:06.428 --> 00:39:08.389]  Many farmers are going to buy and feed it to their cattle.
[00:39:08.409 --> 00:39:09.630]  That's what we saw over in Europe.
[00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:13.112]  I'm afraid some cattle producers here are cutting the same corners.
[00:39:13.993 --> 00:39:15.854]  So there's a concern, certainly.
[00:39:15.974 --> 00:39:27.142]  Also, other loopholes include this bone meal, this blood meal, excuse me, going directly to calves in this country as milk replacer.
[00:39:28.463 --> 00:39:33.207]  The calves are getting this kind of spray dried blood protein.
[00:39:33.857 --> 00:39:38.560]  From cows, and again there we have this cattle tissues being fed to young calves.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:43.163]  There's that cow-to-cow feeding, that cannibalism cycle that the prions love so much.
[00:39:43.363 --> 00:39:44.884]  Well, think about this.
[00:39:45.024 --> 00:39:56.472]  Instead of giving them milk or a milk substitute that's based in what we would think of as just a protein, now they're going to give them blood, turning them into cannibalistic vampires.
[00:39:57.762 --> 00:40:07.726]  It's, I mean, and you know, and the Spray Dried Blood Producers Association actually has a website and boasts how much cheaper it is to feed calves blood rather than feed calves milk.
[00:40:07.766 --> 00:40:13.208]  Also, I've read that the sanguination or the sucking the blood out of the cows is really done as they just crush them down.
[00:40:13.448 --> 00:40:19.510]  There's all kinds of other tissues and juices out of the spinal cord and brain that go into this.
[00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.291]  The exact things that we don't want in the food supply.
[00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:30.918]  Well, we're really concerned about when you, you know, stun the animal unconscious with this devastating blow to the head with these captive bolt starters.
[00:40:30.958 --> 00:40:34.261]  Unfortunately, we're going to splash some of the brain into the circulatory system.
[00:40:34.301 --> 00:40:46.331]  And so when you bleed the cow out and slice her throat into the blood trough, not only are you getting the blood, which we know now is infectious already, but we're getting pieces of brain.
[00:40:46.491 --> 00:40:51.655]  And that's certainly particularly concerning because those are the most infectious parts of the animal.
[00:40:53.442 --> 00:41:01.367]  And again, there's a lot lower standards by light years for what goes into animal feeds compared to what goes into the human food supply.
[00:41:01.547 --> 00:41:10.292]  Yeah, up until yesterday, I mean, it was illegal to feed cow spinal cord to cows, but it was still legal to feed it to people in a hot dog.
[00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:16.750]  Thankfully, some of these risky tissues are now being taken out of the human food supply, but where are they going?
[00:41:17.071 --> 00:41:25.833]  Now they're going to continue to go into animal feed, and we're going to continue to risk the health of our livestock herd and the health of the American public.
[00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:33.475]  Now, you and Oprah, and I appreciate her making that stand so many years ago, had them come after you, then they had to back off.
[00:41:34.695 --> 00:41:37.636]  I mean, you've certainly been vindicated here in spades.
[00:41:39.724 --> 00:41:42.726]  You know, we didn't want to be right, certainly.
[00:41:43.586 --> 00:41:56.054]  But, you know, with the kind of, with the inadequate testing, the continuing of feeding slaughterhouse waste, blood, and meal to calves, and with the downer cow problem, it was just a matter of time.
[00:41:56.394 --> 00:42:06.561]  Understand, my family makes its living in East Texas, pays the taxes, you know, pays for the children's college, everything, with the beef
[00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:09.659]  Profits.
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:15.123]  And we've been ranching since 1830 in East Texas.
[00:42:16.044 --> 00:42:23.588]  I have been wanting to expose the Mad Cow before it got to be a gigantic cover-up and where all confidence was lost.
[00:42:23.989 --> 00:42:29.232]  Because I know most of the ranches are doing it right, not doing this.
[00:42:29.973 --> 00:42:34.956]  And I know my family is, because I've been out there many times feeding them on the summers where I worked on the ranch.
[00:42:35.809 --> 00:42:47.255]  But it makes me very angry that early on they said, oh, you're just against our industry, covered this up, and now have made it worse, because it's going to hurt a lot of farming and ranching families now.
[00:42:47.475 --> 00:42:52.658]  I get calls from producers all the time, and I say, look, go out in the barn and read the ingredients on your milk replacer.
[00:42:52.998 --> 00:42:55.599]  These dairy farmers come back, and they had no idea.
[00:42:55.619 --> 00:42:57.340]  I mean, they're outraged.
[00:42:58.161 --> 00:42:58.961]  And I think
[00:42:59.505 --> 00:43:03.607]  The National Cattlemen's Beef Association is really doing producers a disservice.
[00:43:03.627 --> 00:43:07.509]  They've been fighting tooth and nail against all these regulations.
[00:43:07.529 --> 00:43:09.550]  They fought against the feed ban regulations in 1997.
[00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:15.833]  They fought against trying to have restrictions on downer cows going into the human food supply.
[00:43:16.033 --> 00:43:18.254]  They continue to be against increased testing.
[00:43:18.774 --> 00:43:26.638]  And so while that makes sense in terms of short-term profit, I mean it's a few more pennies if we're only going to feed them cow or soybean protein supplements.
[00:43:27.074 --> 00:43:29.915]  Or, you know, if we're going to add tests on to each animal.
[00:43:30.416 --> 00:43:32.157]  So it's a few more pennies per pound of beef.
[00:43:32.197 --> 00:43:34.958]  So it makes sense in the real short-term profits.
[00:43:35.318 --> 00:43:39.460]  But in the long-term, the industry just lost $3 billion for the exports.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:45.703]  Well, Dr. Greger, I have been watching some of the local and national news, and it's everybody's still eating beef.
[00:43:45.783 --> 00:43:46.624]  Everybody loves it.
[00:43:46.904 --> 00:43:47.784]  Nobody's worried.
[00:43:48.284 --> 00:43:50.405]  But then I talked to all my middle-class neighbors.
[00:43:51.566 --> 00:43:53.427]  My wife isn't buying beef now.
[00:43:53.867 --> 00:43:54.587]  I talked to everybody.
[00:43:54.607 --> 00:43:55.528]  They're not buying it.
[00:43:56.673 --> 00:43:58.534]  But they're telling me everybody still loves it.
[00:43:58.714 --> 00:43:59.895]  I think that's propaganda.
[00:44:00.796 --> 00:44:04.818]  Well, I mean, you can understand how, I mean, that has to be the railing cry.
[00:44:04.838 --> 00:44:05.719]  There's no problem.
[00:44:05.779 --> 00:44:06.820]  Everyone still loves it.
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:15.185]  And, you know, and so they get the quote from the local restauranteur who's saying that, you know, the line for their steakhouse still goes around the corner.
[00:44:16.582 --> 00:44:20.344]  A number of people are really, you know, are being cautious.
[00:44:20.464 --> 00:44:22.265]  I think reasonably cautious about this.
[00:44:22.305 --> 00:44:25.947]  They're saying, look, it could be a low risk, but why take any risk?
[00:44:26.228 --> 00:44:26.528]  Right?
[00:44:26.588 --> 00:44:29.329]  I mean, you can simply choose something else for your dinner plate.
[00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:34.692]  And until we know more, I think that's a reasonable assumption to take.
[00:44:34.933 --> 00:44:39.555]  Doctor, from your decade of study on this, and as a medical doctor looking at this and trained in this,
[00:44:41.494 --> 00:44:48.457]  When they say whole meats are perfectly safe, that is a steak, a brisket, is that accurate?
[00:44:49.317 --> 00:44:50.498]  Well, unfortunately, it's not.
[00:44:50.558 --> 00:44:52.179]  It's misleading for a number of reasons.
[00:44:52.239 --> 00:44:57.961]  First of all, we know that the muscle meat itself, the skeletal muscle itself, may be infectious.
[00:44:58.001 --> 00:45:09.066]  Now, not as infectious as brain and spinal cord, but the USDA and the Cattleman Trade Group has been trying to make it sound like the skeletal meat is completely safe, and unfortunately,
[00:45:10.722 --> 00:45:14.403]  That was really up until two years ago, that's what we thought.
[00:45:14.803 --> 00:45:27.626]  But then Stanley Prusiner's lab out in San Francisco, the guy who won the Nobel Prize for discovering the cause of mad cows, he's found that indeed, at least in the experimental animals, these prions, these deadly prions, could build up in muscle tissue.
[00:45:28.426 --> 00:45:31.527]  Follow-up studies in Germany substantiated the fact.
[00:45:31.607 --> 00:45:38.148]  And then just last month, in the New England Journal of Medicine, we have this autopsy study coming out of Switzerland.
[00:45:38.502 --> 00:45:48.931]  They found that, you know, about a quarter of human, quite celiac disease victims, had these prions in their muscle samples when they got them on autopsy.
[00:45:49.211 --> 00:46:01.922]  So we know it can be in skeletal muscle, and so by saying that these boneless cuts of steak are okay, it's certainly lower risk than eating scrambled beef brains, but it's not zero risk.
[00:46:03.269 --> 00:46:08.792]  Unbelievable, and I'm a big beef eater, folks, and my family makes their living.
[00:46:10.253 --> 00:46:11.173]  My father's family.
[00:46:11.213 --> 00:46:12.754]  This is just horrible news.
[00:46:13.234 --> 00:46:14.875]  There was no reason to do this.
[00:46:15.656 --> 00:46:17.517]  This is the problem with lowering standards.
[00:46:17.577 --> 00:46:21.879]  If nobody fed meat products to cows that aren't supposed to eat meat to begin with, much less rotten meat,
[00:46:22.997 --> 00:46:31.903]  If they weren't supposed to do this in the first place, then across the board you'd have higher quality meats, safe meats, and bigger profits.
[00:46:31.963 --> 00:46:38.108]  But when you allow them to lower the standards, that ends up hurting everybody and only helps the big corporate farms.
[00:46:38.428 --> 00:46:40.429]  It's just bad all the way around.
[00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:45.613]  And now we're going to get more regulation that will squash the small farmers and ranchers.
[00:46:45.893 --> 00:46:48.075]  Big agribusiness will pay off the inspectors.
[00:46:48.255 --> 00:46:49.375]  They're going to keep doing this.
[00:46:49.455 --> 00:46:50.116]  It's disgusting.
[00:46:50.928 --> 00:46:58.834]  And Man County never would have started in the first place back in 1985 if it wasn't for kind of mucking with Mother Nature.
[00:46:58.874 --> 00:47:00.215]  You know, cows are herbivores.
[00:47:00.255 --> 00:47:01.456]  That's how they should be fed.
[00:47:01.736 --> 00:47:05.198]  And instead, not only have we made them into meat eaters, but cannibals as well.
[00:47:05.218 --> 00:47:08.641]  Well, now we can just breed cows with these cloned cows that can eat meat.
[00:47:08.661 --> 00:47:09.441]  Have you heard about that?
[00:47:09.501 --> 00:47:13.264]  They want to have a cloned herd now so we can feed them this rotten stuff.
[00:47:14.004 --> 00:47:14.605]  Right.
[00:47:14.705 --> 00:47:15.546]  That's been the answer.
[00:47:15.906 --> 00:47:16.907]  Okay, well maybe we can
[00:47:19.184 --> 00:47:32.994]  Genetically engineer some cow that's somehow resistant or invulnerable to mad cow disease and where the simplest answer, instead of spending a million dollars down that route, the simplest answer is to just make these real common sense
[00:47:33.816 --> 00:47:39.679]  Concrete practical precautions like not feeding the poultry litter, not feeding the blood product.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:49.305]  This is far worse than that book about falling into the hot dog maker in the book The Jungle at the turn of the century in the Rockefeller factories.
[00:47:49.785 --> 00:47:53.507]  This is far worse than having a rat dropping in your hot dog.
[00:47:53.747 --> 00:47:56.549]  That generally won't rot your brain out.
[00:47:57.418 --> 00:48:14.381]  Right, see, no matter, before prion diseases, before this mad cow disease, no matter how filthy the meat was, if you cook the meat through, you're going to kill off all the bacteria, you're going to kill off the viruses, you're going to kill off, I don't care if there's manure in there, E. coli, rats, you name it, it's safe.
[00:48:14.481 --> 00:48:17.182]  It may be kind of gross, but the meat is safe.
[00:48:17.562 --> 00:48:21.643]  Until all along we got this new pathogen coming along, and you can't kill it.
[00:48:21.963 --> 00:48:22.923]  You can't cook it out.
[00:48:23.383 --> 00:48:24.704]  Nothing you can do to this thing.
[00:48:24.764 --> 00:48:27.626]  It's practically invulnerable because there's a lot of bacteria.
[00:48:27.866 --> 00:48:30.088]  Let's take one call, Dr. Pete in California.
[00:48:30.108 --> 00:48:30.708]  You're on the air.
[00:48:30.768 --> 00:48:31.169]  Go ahead.
[00:48:31.189 --> 00:48:33.250]  Yeah, well you might be interested in this.
[00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:37.113]  I don't know if the doctors ever heard of an African disease called Kuru.
[00:48:37.273 --> 00:48:39.354]  K-U-R-U.
[00:48:39.475 --> 00:48:44.858]  I saw a documentary on discovery on one of these channels about in the 50s.
[00:48:44.898 --> 00:48:45.559]  They were studying
[00:48:46.696 --> 00:48:47.257]  I think so.
[00:49:04.058 --> 00:49:07.719]  50 years after cannibalism was declared illegal.
[00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:15.821]  So these older people, as kids, ate the brains of their dead, and now, that many decades later, are dying from the disease.
[00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:18.161]  That's the scary thing about mad cow disease.
[00:49:18.241 --> 00:49:24.623]  It's not what you ate yesterday, or what you ate last week, it's what you ate years and years ago that can put people at risk.
[00:49:24.823 --> 00:49:29.504]  Is there any way to detox or slough this out, or if you've got it in you, you're in deep trouble?
[00:49:30.211 --> 00:49:32.892]  Well, we don't know what the infectious dose is.
[00:49:32.912 --> 00:49:43.696]  We're hoping that if you get a small enough hit of this stuff, there's not going to be enough prions to build up so that your incubation period could be 70 years, 80 years, and I don't care if I get mad cowed 80 years from now.
[00:49:43.716 --> 00:49:44.837]  I don't think I'm going to be around.
[00:49:45.677 --> 00:49:51.720]  The bigger dose you get, the more brain, infectious brain, that's in your burger, the sooner you're going to get it.
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.061]  So it may be 10 years and not 30 years.
[00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:55.401]  Okay, Pete, thanks for the call.
[00:49:56.021 --> 00:49:57.442]  Carson in Colorado, go ahead.
[00:50:00.295 --> 00:50:04.016]  Yeah, Alex, another large beef consumer to y'all.
[00:50:05.596 --> 00:50:12.538]  I grew up around the ag business in northern Colorado, and it has to do with just common sense practices.
[00:50:12.558 --> 00:50:18.719]  I agree with your analysis, but I think this is not done accidentally.
[00:50:19.299 --> 00:50:28.321]  This is designed to destroy the remnants of the small farmer and rancher, and the American citizen can protect himself by
[00:50:29.013 --> 00:50:34.977]  Insisting on buying organic, locally processed and slaughtered beef products.
[00:50:35.137 --> 00:50:41.982]  Well that's what we do now and you just go out to a rancher you know and you say I want that cow slaughtered and you end up saving money.
[00:50:43.688 --> 00:50:45.109]  And that rancher will get more money.
[00:50:45.369 --> 00:50:47.270]  Do you have any comments on that, Doctor?
[00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:54.193]  The organic standards put forth by the USDA absolutely exclude the feeding of all these rendered by-products to cattle.
[00:50:54.253 --> 00:50:55.974]  So... Doctor, stay there.
[00:50:56.054 --> 00:50:58.575]  Pete, thanks for the call.
[00:50:58.695 --> 00:50:59.896]  And Carson, stay there.
[00:51:00.376 --> 00:51:03.578]  Doctor, we're going to come right back and take a couple more calls here in the final segment with you.
[00:51:04.478 --> 00:51:05.219]  So stay there, Carson.
[00:51:05.239 --> 00:51:05.899]  We'll come back to you.
[00:51:06.139 --> 00:51:09.100]  Then we've got Frank Morales, Colonel Craig Roberts, Jack McClam.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.141]  You don't want to miss this show.

[00:52:11.565 --> 00:52:14.847]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:14.908 --> 00:52:19.091]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:19.331 --> 00:52:22.113]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:22.313 --> 00:52:24.715]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:24.895 --> 00:52:33.521]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:33.721 --> 00:52:35.082]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:52:35.282 --> 00:52:41.486]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:52:41.746 --> 00:52:53.694]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:52:53.874 --> 00:53:00.358]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:53:00.518 --> 00:53:03.700]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:07.923]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:53:08.063 --> 00:53:10.184]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:53:10.204 --> 00:53:11.705]  A New World Order.
[00:53:26.394 --> 00:53:28.116]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:53:41.448 --> 00:53:51.790]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:57.411]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:54:12.637 --> 00:54:14.838]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:54:15.399 --> 00:54:18.300]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:21.102 --> 00:54:24.123]  I want everybody to make a New Year's resolution.
[00:54:25.884 --> 00:54:27.645]  To take action against tyranny.
[00:54:28.426 --> 00:54:31.267]  To stand up for our constitutional republic.
[00:54:32.108 --> 00:54:33.808]  To spread the word in 04.
[00:54:36.013 --> 00:54:44.280]  We're in this final day of 2003, and I want to ask you in this new year to get my documentary films.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:55:02.314]  There's nothing like them out there to wake people up to the tyranny, to the corruption, to the out-of-control despotism, 9-11, the road to tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police States, Retotal Enslavement, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, America, Wake Up or Waco, Painful Deceptions by Eric Huffschmid,
[00:55:03.209 --> 00:55:09.197]  All the great films I've made, the films I carry, the book I've written, the books I've published, the books I, uh, shell that others have written.
[00:55:11.056 --> 00:55:14.538]  In this new year, order the videos today, the books today.
[00:55:14.639 --> 00:55:15.099]  Don't wait.
[00:55:15.139 --> 00:55:20.783]  When you get my videos, the videos I've made, you're authorized to make copies of them, to spread the word, a New Year's resolution.
[00:55:21.083 --> 00:55:24.125]  Get the films, make copies of them, get them out to people.
[00:55:24.445 --> 00:55:26.907]  Toll-free number to order the films, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:26.967 --> 00:55:27.287]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:55:27.347 --> 00:55:30.689]  The films are $25.95 apiece, $20 if you order three or more.
[00:55:40.916 --> 00:55:46.061]  Of the 10 titles I've produced, and that purchase, of course, supports this broadcast.
[00:55:46.081 --> 00:55:49.344]  You can write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:55:49.384 --> 00:55:50.285]  Don't wait.
[00:55:50.305 --> 00:55:51.046]  Make that call today.
[00:55:59.313 --> 00:56:08.180]  As your New Year's resolution to take the first steps against actually waking people up to all this out-of-control behavior as history repeats itself.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:18.808]  We're talking to Michael Greger, a doctor, MD, and the website is organicconsumers.org forward slash madcow.htm.
[00:56:19.168 --> 00:56:21.049]  Going back to Carson in Colorado.
[00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:24.812]  Carson, finish up your comments or questions for the doctor.
[00:56:25.533 --> 00:56:26.693]  Final comment, Alex.
[00:56:27.867 --> 00:56:29.708]  God bless you, your courageous guest.
[00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:35.772]  Dr. Greger, it's truly an honor for me to be able to hear your words on the radio.
[00:56:35.832 --> 00:56:37.953]  I have followed your work in the past.
[00:56:38.093 --> 00:56:52.001]  Alex, yesterday I went down to my coffee center and I enlarged the cover of Harris' Farm Almanac, and I plastered it all over my pickup truck, because apparently we're told now that that is
[00:56:52.628 --> 00:57:02.051]  What terrorist sympathizers are interested in, maps and rural roadways and the farmers' almanac.
[00:57:02.631 --> 00:57:14.615]  I also, you know, wish you and all of your guests and all your fine listeners the finest and most vigorously defended New Year for our liberty and our nation.
[00:57:14.815 --> 00:57:16.056]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[00:57:16.616 --> 00:57:19.957]  Dr. Greger, any comments to what our guest was talking about?
[00:57:20.817 --> 00:57:24.399]  No, I think eating organic is really the way to go.
[00:57:24.499 --> 00:57:28.842]  I mean, really the safest beef on the market right now is organic beef.
[00:57:29.742 --> 00:57:31.003]  Let's take another call.
[00:57:31.503 --> 00:57:32.844]  Let's talk to David in Michigan.
[00:57:32.884 --> 00:57:34.225]  David, you're on the air with our guest.
[00:57:34.365 --> 00:57:35.445]  Hey, Happy New Year, Alex.
[00:57:35.846 --> 00:57:36.666]  Okay, thank you.
[00:57:36.766 --> 00:57:39.388]  I like that one bump you play from the man with two brains.
[00:57:40.768 --> 00:57:45.271]  You know, they go on and on about the beef in this deal.
[00:57:46.071 --> 00:57:47.132]  What about the lamb?
[00:57:47.998 --> 00:57:51.520]  I mean, that's what the English beef gutter from was eating lamb spinal cords.
[00:57:52.021 --> 00:57:56.364]  And everywhere you go in a big city, they got a Giro stand on just about every corner.
[00:57:58.985 --> 00:58:05.510]  Yeah, no, this is, uh, it's, uh, it's, it's not really fair to kind of point this all at the beef industry.
[00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:13.495]  Um, we have, uh, we have some data coming out of France back in 2001 that indeed lamb chops may be causing some of these
[00:58:14.045 --> 00:58:14.825]  We're good to go.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:38.161]  Um, so we have to clean up our entire system.
[00:58:38.361 --> 00:58:43.042]  We've got to stop feeding slaughterhouse waste, not just to cows, but to pigs and poultry as well.
[00:58:43.162 --> 00:58:43.862]  Well, that's it.
[00:58:43.962 --> 00:58:46.083]  I'm just not going to eat anything unless it's organic.
[00:58:46.443 --> 00:58:49.784]  Thank you, Dr. Greger, for coming on the show, and thanks to all the callers.
[00:58:50.604 --> 00:58:51.885]  And have a good New Year, sir.
[00:58:53.005 --> 00:58:53.505]  New Year to you.
[00:58:53.785 --> 00:58:54.465]  All right, folks.
[00:58:54.485 --> 00:58:59.527]  We'll be back with a second hour with your calls, Frank Morales, Colonel Roberts, and Jack McClam.
[00:59:02.697 --> 00:59:11.324]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:59:11.524 --> 00:59:22.813]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:59:23.014 --> 00:59:25.656]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:25.996 --> 00:59:32.457]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:59:32.617 --> 00:59:34.498]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:59:34.698 --> 00:59:40.719]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:59:40.959 --> 00:59:46.641]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:59:46.961 --> 00:59:50.721]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling Pneumo Callable in Iowa.
[00:59:58.368 --> 01:00:01.108]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:09.710]  Big Brother.
[01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:11.410]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:13.231]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:13.891 --> 01:00:14.691]  You want answers?
[01:00:15.471 --> 01:00:16.371]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:20.692]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.212 --> 01:00:25.273]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.062 --> 01:00:35.726]  In 60 minutes, folks, we're going to have Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order.
[01:00:37.426 --> 01:00:42.289]  And of course, Colonel Craig Roberts, who both stand against the police state and the takeover of our society.
[01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:53.455]  I chose to end the year with a discussion of Mad Cow in the last hour and PNAC and their latest militarism ideas to take over the world and now wanting to make France an enemy.
[01:00:54.102 --> 01:00:59.914]  Mad Cow, the police state, this is the basic New World Order takeover that is unprecedented in front of us.
[01:00:59.954 --> 01:01:01.076]  In this show we're going to have
[01:01:02.327 --> 01:01:05.768]  An amazing individual, Frank Morales, on the show.
[01:01:05.788 --> 01:01:10.169]  We're going to be plugging his website and some of the books he's written and some of the films he's in.
[01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:26.774]  He has an amazing knowledge of how they brainwashed the police, how they federalized them, how they've trained them to be automatons, and so you'll want to stay with us for this hour, and I've got a lot of different news items that tie into this that I'll be throwing at him.
[01:01:28.244 --> 01:01:40.351]  Frank Morales, of course, is in my new video, Matrix of Evil, and that's going out around the country, already airing on hundreds of access stations, and we have it available at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:49.035]  So here to talk about the prison economy, the phony drug war, the SWAT teams, the troops, all of it, is Frank Morales.
[01:01:49.735 --> 01:01:51.236]  Frank, thanks for coming on the show, sir.
[01:01:51.536 --> 01:01:52.517]  Hey, it's great to be with you.
[01:01:53.852 --> 01:02:02.776]  You're up in New York and they've got the army black hawk, black helicopters flying around with guys in black ski masks and Nazi helmets pointing machine guns at people.
[01:02:02.816 --> 01:02:08.918]  Does nothing to stop terrorists, but does train us how to live in this East German system.
[01:02:09.398 --> 01:02:10.839]  What's it like in New York right now?
[01:02:11.639 --> 01:02:14.620]  Well, I mean, it's been going on for quite some time now.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:20.803]  The process of psychologically conditioning the people for
[01:02:21.773 --> 01:02:25.476]  Over military slash, you know, policing.
[01:02:26.777 --> 01:02:28.718]  So this is just another manifestation of that.
[01:02:29.739 --> 01:02:49.993]  In addition, you know, the Northern Command is now moving to transform its Joint Task Force 6, which was formerly its drug interdiction unit, about 200 military people, located at Fort Bliss, Texas, into an interagency task force
[01:02:50.779 --> 01:02:52.780]  Well, we're also going to end up
[01:03:12.412 --> 01:03:31.265]  Tommy Francis comments about the next attack, we go to military government, but that's nothing compared to Eberhardt's comments, who's the head of NorthCom, and I would add that Joint Task Force 6 is, you know, it's got 200 bureaucrats, but they command the Fort Hood teams that we videotaped three, four years ago, running checkpoints on the highways.
[01:03:32.085 --> 01:03:36.088]  They've got troops all over the place in the late 80s, in police uniforms.
[01:03:36.508 --> 01:03:38.770]  This covert action's been going on for a while.
[01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:40.391]  Yeah, and you know,
[01:03:41.132 --> 01:03:55.162]  It's got its surveillance component because, you know, the logic of counterinsurgency is that you can't control what it is you can't see or identify.
[01:03:55.202 --> 01:04:09.172]  So the first mission has to do with intelligence gathering and the Pentagon in August, last August, Rumsfeld expanded the counterintelligence field activity.
[01:04:09.853 --> 01:04:17.940]  Or CIFA, C-I-F-A, at the Pentagon, and they've been given kind of a data mining mission.
[01:04:19.902 --> 01:04:21.423]  Well, Eberhardt said in the L.A.
[01:04:21.443 --> 01:04:25.166]  Times, he said, the Army isn't watching you, but the Pentagon is.
[01:04:25.546 --> 01:04:26.687]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:26.907 --> 01:04:36.896]  I mean, it's, you know, one of their projects that's being undertaken by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, which is part of CIFA.
[01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:38.674]  Frank, we got a break.
[01:04:38.694 --> 01:04:42.936]  I want to come back and give folks the definition of a police state, which we're now in.
[01:04:42.956 --> 01:04:46.178]  I want to go over the latest developments with you, honored to have you.
[01:04:46.218 --> 01:04:47.078]  Stay with us.
[01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:12.719]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:05:12.979 --> 01:05:17.723]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:05:17.943 --> 01:05:23.588]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:05:23.968 --> 01:05:26.890]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:33.456]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:05:50.129 --> 01:05:55.392]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:55.412 --> 01:05:55.832]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:04.062 --> 01:06:05.643]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:06.024 --> 01:06:11.768]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:06:12.028 --> 01:06:17.152]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:06:17.493 --> 01:06:26.820]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:32.064]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:06:32.404 --> 01:06:36.409]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:41.436]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:06:41.756 --> 01:06:47.664]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:54.210]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:55.231]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:06:55.251 --> 01:06:56.211]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:07:03.923 --> 01:07:04.943]  Attention Pet Owners!
[01:07:05.243 --> 01:07:08.705]  How would you like your dog or cat to behave instantly on command?
[01:07:09.045 --> 01:07:10.505]  Now you can with the Pet Trainer.
[01:07:10.765 --> 01:07:13.666]  So easy to use, it's like having a remote control for your pet.
[01:07:13.966 --> 01:07:15.447]  No electric zaps or shocks.
[01:07:15.787 --> 01:07:21.269]  This simple handheld device uses safe and effective ultrasonic sound that commands your pet's attention like magic.
[01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:22.209]  Here's how it works.
[01:07:22.569 --> 01:07:24.410]  Say your dog jumps on your best furniture.
[01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:26.411]  Just press the button to emit the sound.
[01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:29.133]  As he snaps to attention, give the command to get down.
[01:07:29.553 --> 01:07:32.615]  As soon as he obeys, praise him for the good behavior, and that's it.
[01:07:32.995 --> 01:07:36.377]  Veterinarian-endorsed, Pet Trainer is the humane way to train pets.
[01:07:36.677 --> 01:07:40.579]  Whether it's non-stop barking, chewing shoes, pestering houseguests, you name it.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.042]  Plus, it's the animal-friendly way to deal with unwelcome strays or neighbor's dogs.
[01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:46.803]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:08.081 --> 01:08:10.984]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.024 --> 01:08:32.624]  I'm not trying to patronize the listeners, but I want you to realize that we're following the exact pattern of classical military dictatorship here in the United States.
[01:08:33.815 --> 01:08:48.387]  And I want Frank Morales, who's in the top five people I know who are experts on the infrastructure of this Orwellian control grid, to go over this from the start like he was talking to a group of high school seniors.
[01:08:49.708 --> 01:09:01.097]  I know a lot of you know more than I do about the globalists and the corruption, but I want this laid out so those out there that don't understand will understand, and for those of us that do have a grasp,
[01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:08.725]  We'll have better talking points to calmly go over this with the general public.
[01:09:09.126 --> 01:09:19.092]  So, Frank Morales, from your decades of study of this, and laying out what would happen and now it has happened, and what you think is going to happen after that,
[01:09:19.667 --> 01:09:21.689]  Well, the question of martial law and police state and so forth.
[01:09:43.507 --> 01:09:54.793]  Ultimately, it comes down, and I think, you know, it's easier for us to conceive of this, I think, more, you know, viscerally, which is control, social control.
[01:09:55.493 --> 01:10:06.799]  And the elite corporate Pentagon interlock that is directing this has its own needs and requirements.
[01:10:06.859 --> 01:10:09.561]  So, you know, but for the moment, those aside,
[01:10:10.171 --> 01:10:30.927]  So, I think a place that we look is that historically over the last three decades, and just escalating exponentially since 9-1-1, is a process where the government is daily expanding military operations into areas of local government and law enforcement that historically have been off limits.
[01:10:30.947 --> 01:10:32.488]  So that's the most general way to look at it.
[01:10:33.101 --> 01:10:42.372]  From the beginning, in terms of the situation we're in right now, the phrase, the militarization of the police, is not a mere metaphor.
[01:10:42.392 --> 01:10:50.841]  This is the process wherein the Pentagon, as the military entity, has, through legislative exceptions to posse comitatus,
[01:10:51.308 --> 01:11:08.014]  Through military transfers of technology from the Pentagon to local law enforcement, the creation of SWAT, etc., etc., the military, within its doctrinal sphere, which is relatively new, of so-called operations other than war, has created new missions for itself.
[01:11:08.594 --> 01:11:15.196]  Now, my position is that these new missions doesn't come out of thin air, that this is not simply the result of
[01:11:15.802 --> 01:11:19.263]  You know, Pentagon Joint Chiefs strategist sitting around deciding to do this.
[01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:22.423]  This is a need of the corporate elite with whom they're interlocked.
[01:11:22.923 --> 01:11:36.426]  And they've initiated a process of creating a police-ization within the military, a function of police-ization, which they're now specifically applying to the U.S.
[01:11:36.446 --> 01:11:40.847]  It's the setting up of the Northern Command, which is the domestic military command.
[01:11:41.716 --> 01:11:47.819]  Um, which is unprecedented, uh, whose job is and can tap on all the other commands.
[01:11:47.859 --> 01:11:51.480]  So it's kind of like, uh, you know, the motherload of commands in a sense.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:58.223]  It's, uh, it's primary function, according to its own, uh, mission statement is to quote, assist law enforcement.
[01:11:58.883 --> 01:12:11.308]  Um, the Posse Comitatus Act, which is an 1878 statue, his, um, uh, forbids through criminal, um, prosecution, the, uh, enforcement of laws domestically by the Pentagon.
[01:12:11.732 --> 01:12:16.413]  So they, you know, they cover that with various, uh, well, we're, we're passively involved.
[01:12:16.453 --> 01:12:18.213]  We're passively involved at Waco.
[01:12:18.853 --> 01:12:22.494]  Um, we're passively involved in Seattle, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:12:23.114 --> 01:12:39.397]  So, you know, in terms of that kind of, uh, initial, um, understanding of what we're in, there's been a process of militarization of the police, um, the Pentagon's publication last year of a domestic operations manual at its center for law and military operations.
[01:12:40.077 --> 01:12:41.137]  Again, unprecedented.
[01:12:41.961 --> 01:12:50.364]  It would formally have been thought that the publication by the Pentagon of a domestic operations manual would have been an oxymoron, a kind of contradiction in terms.
[01:12:50.384 --> 01:12:54.765]  So what are they publishing an operations manual domestically for?
[01:12:55.205 --> 01:12:58.646]  So that gives you a sense of, but it's about social control.
[01:12:58.726 --> 01:13:08.589]  It's about preempting our ability to exercise our rights, the right of dissent, the right of redress to our grievances, the right to be heard.
[01:13:09.201 --> 01:13:16.523]  It's one thing to have free speech, it's another thing, yeah, well, we'll let you have free speech in this pen, or in the middle of the ocean.
[01:13:17.583 --> 01:13:23.165]  You know, we want the right to dissent, we want the right to be heard, to have our dissent have effect.
[01:13:24.185 --> 01:13:30.727]  So it's about social control, and one other more ominous... So there's a lot of stuff to look at.
[01:13:30.747 --> 01:13:33.427]  The weaponry, the so-called use of non-lethal weaponry.
[01:13:33.467 --> 01:13:35.588]  Again, the Council on Foreign Relations
[01:13:36.207 --> 01:13:45.316]  uh... back in nineteen ninety five and then again in nineteen ninety nine issued reports on non-lethal weapons and advocated strongly uh... for their youth
[01:13:47.349 --> 01:13:50.131]  You know, against civilian and non-combatant populations.
[01:13:50.351 --> 01:13:59.437]  This is, again, a corporate military interlock, a CFR, and so they began early on promoting the use of these weapons.
[01:13:59.857 --> 01:14:06.402]  And, Frank, the CFR also said in these documents, we're going to need terror attacks as the pretext to use this.
[01:14:06.662 --> 01:14:15.668]  Yeah, the notion that, you know, our government within this militarized context now, so if you just look at the context we're in as we move into 9-1-1,
[01:14:16.826 --> 01:14:23.532]  Within that context, has historically had no problem in creating provocateur action.
[01:14:24.172 --> 01:14:40.326]  Operation Northwood, documents are available, you can read the Joint Chiefs' own words, openly advocate creating a pretext in Cuba, including, you know, killing their own people, in order to create a pretext to invade Cuba.
[01:14:41.146 --> 01:14:45.090]  Now, you know, issues aside, as far as the politics of all that,
[01:14:45.649 --> 01:15:04.997]  But, I mean, the ability or the willingness of our government to kill its own people in order to, you know, help rationalize, justify, and sell its policies, in this case, you know, global plunder and social control, you know, globally, you know, that's happened before.
[01:15:05.457 --> 01:15:09.699]  But in terms of a more ominous development recently in terms of the CIA,
[01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:34.234]  Which is, of course, also part of this, and the infrastructure, again, of social control has those two components, which is intelligence, to get, you know, to find out, you know, who people, who you are, and that's this geospatial thing I was mentioning, geospatial intelligence agency, which wants to create a spatial data infrastructure, which will be created down to the house level.
[01:15:34.867 --> 01:15:35.468]  To your home.
[01:15:35.608 --> 01:15:36.609]  Intelligent vandalism.
[01:15:36.989 --> 01:15:45.276]  Let me just add, I interviewed people five years ago who were hired by companies to take digital photos of front, back, and top of all the homes in every city.
[01:15:45.496 --> 01:15:46.417]  They've already got that.
[01:15:46.477 --> 01:15:49.539]  I found that when they announce something, it's already been in place.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.320]  Exactly.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.062]  So, I mean, this is the process.
[01:15:52.522 --> 01:15:59.788]  And the most recent overt manifestation of this, because now I think, you know, in terms of that, you asked me to give a general picture.
[01:15:59.808 --> 01:16:02.030]  Well, let's give, this is the concluding part of it.
[01:16:02.478 --> 01:16:16.561]  Is that ultimately, you know, that it's going to require, you know, people on the streets who are, who are, who are interfering in, you know, pressuring, arresting, detaining citizenry.
[01:16:16.921 --> 01:16:19.061]  So, you know, it's going to come down to that level.
[01:16:19.501 --> 01:16:21.762]  And who are the experts in that?
[01:16:21.802 --> 01:16:28.583]  Well, you know, the CIA has a long history of covert operations, and that's like a pretty term.
[01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:40.113]  For torture, setting up death squads, assassinations, you know, creating dummy front organizations, etc, etc.
[01:16:40.994 --> 01:16:43.255]  Recently, let me just finish with this, Alex.
[01:16:43.295 --> 01:16:45.816]  This is important and people need to get on this now.
[01:16:48.137 --> 01:16:52.598]  Caroline Maloney in the House of Representatives just put forth a bill.
[01:16:53.159 --> 01:16:54.599]  It's called H.R.
[01:16:54.859 --> 01:16:56.860]  3439 in the House of Representatives.
[01:16:57.441 --> 01:17:04.084]  This bill would embed CIA agents in local police precincts around the country.
[01:17:05.065 --> 01:17:22.553]  Quoting from the bill, upon request of the head of state or local law enforcement agency, the Director of Central Intelligence may detail any employee within the Central Intelligence Agency to that state or local law enforcement agency on a non-reimbursable basis.
[01:17:22.653 --> 01:17:25.794]  This bill would amend the 1949 Charter of the CIA
[01:17:27.748 --> 01:17:28.088]  I don't
[01:17:44.899 --> 01:17:49.581]  Um, uh, uh, control of, uh, and, and worth of the, uh, citizenry.
[01:17:49.901 --> 01:17:51.802]  And Frank, we know that's already been going on.
[01:17:51.842 --> 01:18:08.969]  I would add a third point, not just intelligence and people on the ground, but also the Pentagon office of strategic information who said they plant news stories have been caught planning hundreds of fake letters from troops and the newspapers lies about, you know, domestic fear mongering, fake, fake attacks drills.
[01:18:08.989 --> 01:18:10.830]  They've been running to create fear, right?
[01:18:11.727 --> 01:18:25.999]  Yeah, I think that, you know, obviously a big part of this is to psychologically condition, whether it's psychologically conditioning soldiers to act reflexively when they shoot.
[01:18:26.059 --> 01:18:34.746]  You know, they've had to use operating conditioning techniques for local police so that they have less of a problem, you know, shooting or threatening
[01:18:35.693 --> 01:18:38.716]  You know, there are people in their own communities and so forth.
[01:18:38.796 --> 01:18:46.882]  And going back to what you said, I would add that we've had the CIA in big departments for decades, but now they're going to legalize their criminal activity.
[01:18:46.902 --> 01:18:49.684]  Yeah, I think it's very important that people get on this bill right away.
[01:18:49.704 --> 01:18:51.025]  We've got to stop this.
[01:18:52.406 --> 01:18:59.311]  On our website, we have the bill and analysis of the situation, but this would embed CIA agents
[01:18:59.895 --> 01:19:02.697]  In local police departments around the country.
[01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:05.019]  Please give the website out.
[01:19:05.419 --> 01:19:20.391]  It's DemilitarizeThePolice, it's all one word, you know, DemilitarizeThePolice, one long phrase, .netfirms, N-E-T-F-I-R-M-S, netfirms.com.
[01:19:20.451 --> 01:19:22.753]  And we'll give that out again a little bit later.
[01:19:22.793 --> 01:19:25.675]  Yeah, on there, it's immediately, we have the bills there and so forth.
[01:19:25.715 --> 01:19:26.376]  It sounds
[01:19:26.852 --> 01:19:44.626]  Incredible, but in fact, this bill attempts to completely thwart, surreptitiously, which is apropos for the CIA, the intent of the original setting up of the CIA, which is supposedly to act internationally.
[01:19:44.666 --> 01:19:46.648]  We know this is otherwise, of course, Alex.
[01:19:46.668 --> 01:19:48.730]  Well, it's a domestic KGB.
[01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.470]  Exactly.
[01:19:52.034 --> 01:19:57.656]  And those are the people that will be training and orchestrating the direct, hands-on approach, as I was referring to.
[01:19:58.016 --> 01:20:01.057]  Well, they've already been doing it, now they're going to legalize it.
[01:20:01.317 --> 01:20:03.458]  Stay there, there's a lot more to cover in your calls.
[01:20:06.579 --> 01:20:07.079]  Late summer, 2003.
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:11.581]  Mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[01:20:11.981 --> 01:20:12.461]  Late summer, 2002.
[01:20:12.501 --> 01:20:13.181]  I heard the same thing.
[01:20:13.201 --> 01:20:13.441]  Late summer, 2001.
[01:20:13.722 --> 01:20:14.662]  You heard the same thing.
[01:20:18.410 --> 01:20:25.533]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average currently trading in a 93 to 9400 range is down 7% from two years ago.
[01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:26.934]  That's recovery?
[01:20:27.554 --> 01:20:32.757]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[01:20:33.157 --> 01:20:34.738]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:38.159]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.

[01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:35.627]  All you need to know is the name of the program you would like a copy of and the month that it aired.

[01:22:04.577 --> 01:22:06.558]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:22:06.638 --> 01:22:17.344]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:22.247]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:22:22.307 --> 01:22:33.653]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:22:34.233 --> 01:22:41.100]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:22:41.501 --> 01:22:43.623]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:22:44.124 --> 01:22:49.089]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:22:49.389 --> 01:22:55.913]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:22:56.333 --> 01:22:59.956]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:23:00.176 --> 01:23:03.038]  That's toll free.
[01:23:03.058 --> 01:23:03.798]  888-803-4438.
[01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:07.460]  You're losing your hair and you haven't tried Avocore yet?
[01:23:07.881 --> 01:23:10.342]  You've heard all about it on radio and TV for years.
[01:23:10.542 --> 01:23:14.485]  Well, there's a reason why Avocore has become the most recognized name in hair regrowth.
[01:23:14.805 --> 01:23:22.690]  Simply because tens of thousands of people just like you have successfully regrown their hair and regain that youthful appearance, thanks to Avocor.
[01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:30.615]  That's right, Avocor's all-natural DHT blocker and physician's topical formula have reversed hair loss for virtually everyone who has ordered.
[01:23:31.095 --> 01:23:32.216]  So why haven't you called?
[01:23:32.636 --> 01:23:43.503]  We realize there's a lot of confusion out there, but while so many hair growth products come and go, Avocor's clinical studies and claims of success have been independently reviewed and proven true.
[01:23:44.048 --> 01:23:44.928]  Still not convinced?
[01:23:45.248 --> 01:23:49.289]  Avacor is so effective that it comes with a full one-year money-back guarantee.
[01:23:49.389 --> 01:23:50.649]  Try getting that anywhere else.
[01:23:50.849 --> 01:23:52.269]  To order Avacor, call 800-533-7298.
[01:23:52.329 --> 01:23:54.730]  The sooner you call, the sooner you can reverse your hair loss.
[01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.950]  Call 800-533-7298.
[01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.330]  That's 800-533-7298.
[01:24:14.564 --> 01:24:18.286]  Alright, our guest is Frank Morales, expert on the police state.
[01:24:18.486 --> 01:24:26.889]  The website is www.DemilitarizeThePolice.NetFirms.com.
[01:24:28.110 --> 01:24:32.752]  That's DemilitarizeThePolice.NetFirms.com.
[01:24:32.792 --> 01:24:37.794]  And I think we have a link to that on the main page of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:37.834 --> 01:24:38.694]  If we don't, we will.
[01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:41.915]  Frank, look, I've studied the New World Order.
[01:24:42.015 --> 01:24:43.096]  I've been on the ground
[01:24:43.962 --> 01:24:48.466]  You know, back in 99, catching the military running checkpoints in Central Texas.
[01:24:48.526 --> 01:24:57.294]  I got newscasts from Iowa, Tennessee, California before 9-11, where they had the military out searching cars with police.
[01:24:57.915 --> 01:25:03.700]  I've interviewed Marine Corps officers who in 89 and 88 were kicking down gun dealers' doors in Norfolk, Virginia.
[01:25:04.161 --> 01:25:06.543]  This has been quietly going on for a long time.
[01:25:07.388 --> 01:25:18.813]  And now we've got Eberhardt, the head of NORTHCOM, saying, well, we're under the extraordinary level, the highest level of alert, the real alert that matters, not the scaremongering, you know, orange alert we're under now, that scale.
[01:25:19.273 --> 01:25:27.817]  He says, yeah, you know, troops in our lives, on the streets, and Tommy Frank says it's, well, the next attack will set aside the Constitution, it's too bad.
[01:25:28.338 --> 01:25:31.079]  But this was all, again, set up beforehand.
[01:25:31.859 --> 01:25:38.683]  And one of the biggest facets is shows like 24 on Fox, Threat Matrix on ABC, all these shows.
[01:25:38.923 --> 01:25:40.624]  They torture people, it's good.
[01:25:41.245 --> 01:25:45.267]  They arrest people who are drug dealers and charge them with terrorism, because that's terrorism.
[01:25:45.847 --> 01:25:50.050]  It's a mass manual to condition us that all of this is acceptable.
[01:25:51.210 --> 01:25:56.392]  I mean, there's so much to talk about here, so much that's happening.
[01:25:56.412 --> 01:26:03.075]  You know, the children in the schools with guns to their heads, police dogs on them, no drugs found, cameras in the bathrooms.
[01:26:03.695 --> 01:26:20.202]  I mean, I'm trying to boil it down for people that this is a Orwellian, but not just Orwellian, a Nazi-Russian command and control, whatever you want to... This is classical, classical system that they are scientifically building.
[01:26:23.252 --> 01:26:34.557]  There's a book called Hitler's Justice by a guy named Mueller, who is a German lawyer, and what you're saying is astounding.
[01:26:34.597 --> 01:26:46.182]  I mean, the whole thing about emergency decrees and, you know, the Reichstag fire in Germany, the emergency decree, 9-1-1, the Patriot...
[01:26:50.251 --> 01:26:56.395]  And then the ideology of defending the homeland.
[01:26:56.415 --> 01:26:58.696]  You know, the pattern is the same.
[01:26:58.716 --> 01:27:03.479]  Localization of local law enforcement.
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.501]  And they're overtly using the same nomenclature.
[01:27:06.902 --> 01:27:07.142]  Yeah.
[01:27:08.503 --> 01:27:09.904]  Why are they being so overt?
[01:27:10.784 --> 01:27:15.627]  Well, I think part of it is the psychological operations approach.
[01:27:17.597 --> 01:27:35.329]  I don't think we've actually coined a phrase for it, or maybe there is, but it's kind of externalizing people's fears as a way for them to not only be afraid, but in some way to adapt to them.
[01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:46.097]  Tommy Frank's statement, for instance, regarding that Cigar Aficionado magazine that came out recently, his long interview there,
[01:27:46.792 --> 01:27:54.155]  Which he says, well, you know, if another terrorist action, we might have to say goodbye to the Constitution and go with a military-style government.
[01:27:54.715 --> 01:27:59.756]  Kind of pretending as though, you know, that's not what it is that he wants, but the floating of these ideas.
[01:28:01.197 --> 01:28:09.580]  The Pentagon awarded, gave an award to a writer who wrote a piece in 1994.
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.642]  The title of the piece was Military Coup in 2012.
[01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:17.511]  I don't know.
[01:28:30.121 --> 01:28:40.548]  I mean, that's a big deal to have generals talking about the next step being martial law, or, hey, maybe torture's good.
[01:28:40.568 --> 01:28:45.191]  As you said, floating it out there, where we even have debates about it.
[01:28:45.412 --> 01:28:47.493]  Well, is martial law what we need?
[01:28:47.513 --> 01:28:48.073]  Yeah.
[01:28:48.334 --> 01:28:54.538]  Well, because it requires a certain conditioning of the population, so there'll be rationalizations
[01:28:55.208 --> 01:29:01.449]  For the use of non-lethal weapons, there'll be rationalizations put forth to try to convince the people.
[01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:07.591]  But I think the American people understand clearly, in some respects, what's going on.
[01:29:07.611 --> 01:29:09.851]  There's obviously an element of fear.
[01:29:10.471 --> 01:29:17.053]  But our campaign, for instance, demilitarizing the police, what we're looking at is we have to delineate
[01:29:17.475 --> 01:29:34.075]  The way in which we can break these, you know, we can stop these developments in the areas of weaponry that's being, that people are, these local law enforcement agencies are receiving the electromagnetic pulse weaponry and so forth.
[01:29:34.456 --> 01:29:36.919]  Those things, we can identify those as the public funds.
[01:29:37.321 --> 01:29:40.342]  There's a public, these are contracts that are made, these people are buying these things.
[01:29:40.422 --> 01:29:41.763]  I tell you what, Frank, we got a break again.
[01:29:41.783 --> 01:29:48.586]  I want to come back and talk about those weapons and solutions and what you see in the next year or two if we don't stop this.
[01:29:48.746 --> 01:29:50.427]  And we'll take your calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:29:50.467 --> 01:29:51.047]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.167 --> 01:29:52.208]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.228 --> 01:29:55.089]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.978 --> 01:30:10.220]  It's here and Ted Anderson from Midas Resources wants to be sure you call right now and get yours today.
[01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:13.101]  It's the 22nd Edition Blue Book of Gun Values.
[01:30:13.361 --> 01:30:19.184]  I love going to all the big gun shows and now I can buy with the comfort of knowing exactly what that old Winchester is really worth.

[01:30:36.514 --> 01:30:41.220]  The 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values contains nearly 1 million words of text.
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:46.726]  No other book even comes close and most of the information in this publication is not available anywhere else.

[01:30:54.917 --> 01:30:55.278]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:04.260]  Gold.
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:05.901]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:31:06.161 --> 01:31:12.243]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:31:12.443 --> 01:31:16.264]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:31:16.604 --> 01:31:18.505]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:31:18.545 --> 01:31:18.725]  Mint,
[01:31:19.085 --> 01:31:20.826]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[01:31:20.966 --> 01:31:28.690]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:37.974]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[01:31:46.078 --> 01:31:46.418]  Thank you.
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:06.862]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:32:07.122 --> 01:32:08.542]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:10.463]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:32:10.743 --> 01:32:15.906]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:32:16.266 --> 01:32:20.748]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:29.752]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh, used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:32:30.212 --> 01:32:31.313]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:32:31.826 --> 01:32:35.568]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:32:35.848 --> 01:32:42.471]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:32:42.811 --> 01:32:46.853]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[01:32:47.293 --> 01:32:49.254]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[01:32:49.514 --> 01:32:50.435]  Call toll-free 800-569-4340.
[01:32:50.455 --> 01:32:50.655]  That's 800-569-4340.
[01:32:50.715 --> 01:32:52.116]  Or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[01:33:04.875 --> 01:33:19.765]  All right, my friends, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:33:21.646 --> 01:33:26.489]  Crystallizing it down to its simplest form, its classical tyranny.
[01:33:28.331 --> 01:33:30.272]  I mean, again, a piece of the puzzle.
[01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:40.053]  I turn on Army News Watch three years ago, before 9-11, that airs every day on Channel 17, our local cable.
[01:33:40.133 --> 01:33:42.754]  The county has its own television channel on the cable.
[01:33:43.755 --> 01:33:52.499]  And it's a federal show, and it says, hey, no matter where you live, we will drop by your office if you have two employees or a hundred and drug test them.
[01:33:53.430 --> 01:34:06.816]  The Pentagon wants to help, and at the end of the show, a little local blurb put on there about, hey, troops from Fort Hood or troops from Camp Mabry or troops from down in San Antonio will come to Austin and drug test your employees once a month or every week.
[01:34:07.617 --> 01:34:12.339]  Again, getting the military involved in drug testing you for free, because they care!
[01:34:13.633 --> 01:34:18.915]  And I saw articles in 99 out of North Carolina where, oh, the troops are training to fight terrorism.
[01:34:18.935 --> 01:34:22.817]  We're going to have troops in the factories soon watching everyone.
[01:34:22.857 --> 01:34:25.338]  I mean, this is classical communist China, folks.
[01:34:26.258 --> 01:34:34.421]  And it's right here in front of us happening, ratcheting it up more and more, federalizing your local police.
[01:34:35.321 --> 01:34:37.602]  And Frank Morales has been fighting this for a long time.
[01:34:37.622 --> 01:34:38.663]  He's written a book on the subject.
[01:34:38.683 --> 01:34:39.923]  We'll talk about that a little bit later.
[01:34:40.843 --> 01:34:42.024]  Got a bunch of callers here.
[01:34:43.057 --> 01:34:51.942]  But, Frank, yeah, if they want to give local police a Humvee with a microwave gun on the top, we've got to take control of our cities politically and say no.
[01:34:53.042 --> 01:34:55.523]  But to first stop that, we've got to be able to vote.
[01:34:55.603 --> 01:35:02.167]  Well, three of the big touchscreen electronic voting machine companies have former deputy directors of the CIA running them.
[01:35:02.187 --> 01:35:03.827]  They've been caught manipulating elections.
[01:35:03.847 --> 01:35:08.630]  They've got convicted felons for computer fraud as their vice presidents running elections.
[01:35:09.710 --> 01:35:11.131]  So it's definitely
[01:35:11.963 --> 01:35:13.664]  We're very late in the hour.
[01:35:14.104 --> 01:35:17.766]  Why, here's a question, why do the globalists need this?
[01:35:17.786 --> 01:35:20.728]  You know, we've put up with this tyranny so far non-violently.
[01:35:21.008 --> 01:35:26.732]  What is it they have planned so horrible they know they've got to have a massive oppression force?
[01:35:27.392 --> 01:35:34.956]  Well, I think in part, you know, they suffer from what is known as the paranoia of the thief.
[01:35:36.057 --> 01:35:38.358]  So, you know, they're afraid.
[01:35:40.126 --> 01:35:43.229]  And I think that what they have planned is exactly what we're seeing.
[01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:58.085]  You know, but I think that the counterattack on our part has to be, you know, they're attacking us at the base, in our homes, in the communities, and so forth.
[01:35:58.125 --> 01:36:02.189]  And we have to formulate strategies that deal with it on that level.
[01:36:03.355 --> 01:36:11.041]  The voting is one aspect of it, but I think there are a number of other things we can do, which is to try and block.
[01:36:11.101 --> 01:36:14.204]  We have to preempt their ability to preempt us.
[01:36:14.844 --> 01:36:25.553]  And I think that by identifying within local police departments and local law enforcement agencies, you know, we need to deconstruct those entities.
[01:36:25.993 --> 01:36:28.936]  We need to find the contracts that are let
[01:36:29.423 --> 01:36:32.505]  And an example of that would be 400 plus cities now throwing out the Patriot Act.
[01:36:53.408 --> 01:36:59.753]  Would be for people to get their local congresspeople to begin process of recodification of Posse Comitatus Act.
[01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:11.822]  The Posse Comitatus Act is, you know, it's just a law and it's only so strong as the people below it who, you know, are pushing to make it effective.
[01:37:12.323 --> 01:37:21.490]  It's the law that delineates the role of the military and the police and says it's a criminal violation for the Pentagon to be involved in.
[01:37:21.917 --> 01:37:23.377]  In local law enforcement and so forth.
[01:37:23.397 --> 01:37:24.638]  We need to recodify that.
[01:37:25.018 --> 01:37:26.678]  We need to reaffirm it.
[01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:34.920]  We need to have people begin to create a discourse within the Congress of pushing the military out of our lives here.
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:40.081]  Well, Frank Morales, here's an example of what this means.
[01:37:41.001 --> 01:37:47.823]  Whether it's Miami or Seattle, and we've got judges now admitting this, reporters have seen this, you'll have a couple thousand peaceful people
[01:37:48.866 --> 01:37:52.833]  Ten thugs run up in black uniforms, dressed like anarchists, start hitting people.
[01:37:53.154 --> 01:37:54.656]  They pull back behind the police.
[01:37:54.957 --> 01:37:58.964]  The police then attack all the innocent people, old women, reporters, you name it.
[01:38:00.319 --> 01:38:04.260]  And the same thing happened here in Austin at a Fortune 500 meeting.
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:06.840]  The cops, I was in the middle of it, were trying to provocateur.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:12.461]  Suddenly, five years ago, they're issued black uniforms and the weird ninja outfits.
[01:38:12.841 --> 01:38:15.082]  Suddenly, Delta Force is involved in advising them.
[01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:17.162]  Suddenly, these riots break out.
[01:38:17.522 --> 01:38:19.463]  Suddenly, you can't protest anywhere.
[01:38:19.503 --> 01:38:25.724]  They heard you off ten miles from where the WTO or whoever's meeting.
[01:38:26.364 --> 01:38:31.645]  I mean, they really are, time after time, trying to stop protests.
[01:38:31.665 --> 01:38:38.687]  And that tells me, they've got stuff planned that's so horrible, they know there's going to be huge protests, they're trying to preempt that now.
[01:38:38.827 --> 01:38:39.307]  Exactly.
[01:38:40.488 --> 01:38:44.769]  It's a primary, you know, it's a beginning point.
[01:38:44.809 --> 01:38:49.130]  Again, as I mentioned for counterinsurgency, is to act preemptively.
[01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:50.830]  It's gathering the intelligence.
[01:38:50.890 --> 01:38:53.351]  And the whole preemptive notion is not something Bush came up with.
[01:38:53.711 --> 01:38:54.911]  It's a long-time tenet.
[01:38:55.382 --> 01:38:58.684]  of counter-insurgency work, the CIA and so forth.
[01:38:59.864 --> 01:39:09.308]  The Pentagon's Operation Garden Plot, which is the overall so-called civil disturbance suppression apparatus, has been in high gear.
[01:39:09.849 --> 01:39:21.794]  And what we're seeing now is an attempt overtly, what happened in Miami, I was on a panel with some steel workers the other day, and this was a torture, a thuggery,
[01:39:23.158 --> 01:39:26.159]  Violating the rights of peaceful dissent.
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:32.202]  And I think people now are clear about it, and we need to go directly at this.
[01:39:32.662 --> 01:39:40.585]  We can't allow for, except as the fait accompli, that these people are going to continue to escalate their violence against us.
[01:39:40.685 --> 01:39:49.428]  And I think if people organize and look specifically, I think it's important, my own position is that we need to look at this weaponry.
[01:39:49.898 --> 01:39:52.399]  We need to take these tools out of their hands.
[01:39:52.819 --> 01:40:03.523]  And I think if we organize, if we look at the funding chains, and we can do that, and create legislation on a local level, Posse Comitatus Act-like statutes on a local level.
[01:40:03.763 --> 01:40:04.984]  Okay, let's take some calls.
[01:40:05.524 --> 01:40:10.206]  Ron in New York, and then Chris and Diane and others.
[01:40:10.266 --> 01:40:11.346]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:40:11.806 --> 01:40:12.247]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:12.507 --> 01:40:13.007]  Hi, Frank.
[01:40:13.127 --> 01:40:14.948]  I would like to wish you both a Happy New Year.
[01:40:15.188 --> 01:40:15.808]  Happy New Year.
[01:40:17.408 --> 01:40:18.289]  Hopefully it will be.
[01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:26.549]  With reference to the militarization of police, this is not anything that is new, and this is not something that came about since 9-11-2001.
[01:40:26.729 --> 01:40:29.629]  But there's a hyper-warp acceleration.
[01:40:29.749 --> 01:40:30.370]  That's correct.
[01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:33.250]  That was the catalyst to accelerate the process.
[01:40:34.291 --> 01:40:37.791]  I was making these observations as far back as ten years ago.
[01:40:37.811 --> 01:40:40.332]  Eleven years ago, I saw this happening.
[01:40:41.112 --> 01:40:43.653]  All the way back in the early days of the Clinton administration.
[01:40:44.181 --> 01:40:50.148]  When they were giving hardware like armored vehicles that they had decommissioned in the military to a police agency.
[01:40:50.228 --> 01:40:56.635]  I'm from, I'm retired from the New York City Police Department and this is something I had spoken out about way back then.
[01:40:57.376 --> 01:41:03.964]  As a matter of fact, Clinton, I don't know if any of you would remember this, Clinton had made a remark back at that time
[01:41:04.557 --> 01:41:10.864]  That he wanted to shift the gears of what would be called the military-industrial complex to law enforcement.
[01:41:11.485 --> 01:41:14.248]  And that's what Eberhardt said in the LA Times.
[01:41:14.288 --> 01:41:18.452]  He said, we're now focused on the home game, not the away game.
[01:41:18.813 --> 01:41:22.357]  And Clinton said that ten years ago because, of course, with the end of the Cold War,
[01:41:22.857 --> 01:41:31.443]  We didn't have the communists in Russia to fight anymore, so I guess this military-industrial complex has to continue to profit and thrive, so it has to find an enemy.
[01:41:31.463 --> 01:41:33.124]  Well, Ron, it's like the drug war.
[01:41:33.164 --> 01:41:34.906]  They ship the drugs in to create the crisis.
[01:41:35.206 --> 01:41:38.668]  Now they create the terror to create the crisis.
[01:41:38.688 --> 01:41:40.369]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:41:41.851 --> 01:41:45.173]  And they're the ones who are controlling, creating the problem, the reaction, and the solution.
[01:41:45.393 --> 01:41:48.595]  Yeah, I think you're exactly on point, Ron.
[01:41:48.715 --> 01:41:49.176]  I think the
[01:41:50.151 --> 01:42:03.873]  The thing about Clinton and under Clinton was he and Reno got together and created a memorandum between the DOD and the DOJ called the Technology Transfer Agreement.
[01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:05.085]  Correct.
[01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:10.148]  And legislatively, you know, sanctioned, legalized that process that you're pointing out.
[01:42:10.168 --> 01:42:13.310]  And that includes ground penetrating radar to look through your walls.
[01:42:13.450 --> 01:42:14.291]  Yeah, all kinds of things.
[01:42:14.331 --> 01:42:18.554]  There's a small arms industry boom at this point in this type of stuff.
[01:42:18.594 --> 01:42:23.677]  Everything from surveillance, so-called non-lethal, less than lethal, whatever, you know, these are
[01:42:24.492 --> 01:42:28.416]  The primary point being that they're directed against non-combatants.
[01:42:28.736 --> 01:42:35.002]  Well, really, when you train someone, these are like having the gloves on for kickboxing.
[01:42:35.222 --> 01:42:41.248]  This is to train the police to engage the public so we get used to this image of guns shooting at crowds.
[01:42:41.468 --> 01:42:44.131]  This is preparing us for Tiananmen Square events.
[01:42:44.611 --> 01:42:47.394]  This is acclimation of the public, as you mentioned, Alex.
[01:42:47.534 --> 01:42:49.356]  These shows, the news reports here,
[01:42:49.836 --> 01:42:58.262]  Listen, I had some interaction with the press in the 1990s, a little bit, I guess, sort of a local phenomenon for a short time, and I know how interviews are done.
[01:42:58.882 --> 01:43:06.508]  And I know that the press can create the impression, particularly the broadcast media, that something that is wholly unpopular is popular.
[01:43:06.828 --> 01:43:17.195]  Case in point, we had news reports yesterday evening in our local news in New York City, and they find probably the two people out of a crowd of a thousand who agree with their premise
[01:43:17.802 --> 01:43:26.231]  And they would actually use this to brainwash people that, you know, the majority of the public wants the government to put proctoscopes in us in order to keep us free.
[01:43:26.631 --> 01:43:27.171]  Hey, Ron.
[01:43:27.352 --> 01:43:28.273]  Ron, thanks for the call.
[01:43:28.333 --> 01:43:30.595]  And for Frank Morales, I talked about this in the first hour.
[01:43:30.635 --> 01:43:33.458]  I talked to my friend who works at the Bergstrom Airport here in Austin.
[01:43:34.199 --> 01:43:36.521]  He said he watched News 8, the local news channel.
[01:43:37.443 --> 01:43:48.188]  Talked to over 40 people who all disagree with the new security, said they didn't like it, said it didn't keep them safe, said it was a joke, said control the borders, and then one old lady at the end said, I love it.
[01:43:48.308 --> 01:43:52.410]  They talked to her, turned their cameras off, left, and then it was her on the news.
[01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:53.110]  Go ahead, Frank.
[01:43:53.210 --> 01:44:04.715]  Yeah, it's clear that the control of information and the manipulation of the population through this so-called mass media
[01:44:05.453 --> 01:44:07.433]  Is part of the problem.
[01:44:08.054 --> 01:44:14.155]  So, you know, all I can say is thank God for shows like yours and others that are putting out the information.
[01:44:14.195 --> 01:44:23.917]  Because, you know, the point Ron made about the thin hold that they have on the population, that they have to do that, you know, because we could look at that two ways.
[01:44:23.937 --> 01:44:29.859]  Yeah, they report on this one woman, but hey, those 99 people out there who disagreed, that's us.
[01:44:30.439 --> 01:44:34.900]  And I think what we need to do is now organize at the grassroots level
[01:44:35.365 --> 01:44:36.645]  And begin to attack these problems.
[01:44:36.685 --> 01:44:40.206]  I'm very confident in the creative potential of people to deal with this.
[01:44:40.226 --> 01:44:41.046]  Here's the problem, Frank.
[01:44:41.126 --> 01:44:42.386]  They could blow something up today.
[01:44:42.426 --> 01:44:43.807]  They're saying, oh, it's probably going to happen.
[01:44:43.867 --> 01:44:44.727]  I hope it doesn't.
[01:44:44.987 --> 01:44:48.988]  But the point is, they're capable of doing whatever's needed to scare us.
[01:44:49.208 --> 01:44:55.509]  We've got to have the understanding, the renaissance, the epiphany, that it is the military-industrial complex behind the terror.
[01:44:55.749 --> 01:44:57.850]  If we can't get that across, they're going to keep winning.
[01:44:58.110 --> 01:44:58.330]  Yeah.
[01:44:58.530 --> 01:45:02.311]  No, as long as people buy the notion that there are these
[01:45:05.046 --> 01:45:10.508]  Demons out there that are coming from some other place and so forth, you know, whatever.
[01:45:10.548 --> 01:45:14.229]  It's true that it's a provocateur state.
[01:45:15.069 --> 01:45:22.471]  These people create these situations in order to justify and rationalize their own agenda.
[01:45:23.552 --> 01:45:30.454]  There's certainly, and you've promoted a lot of this information around 9-1-1 that would lead most reasonable people
[01:45:31.181 --> 01:45:34.343]  Say, hey, there's some kind of setup going on here.
[01:45:34.383 --> 01:45:35.883]  This stinks.
[01:45:36.343 --> 01:45:49.370]  And with Operation Northwood and other historical precedents, we see that they're quite capable of creating terrorist events in order to justify social control, this agenda.
[01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:50.830]  Let's take another call.
[01:45:50.850 --> 01:45:53.632]  Let's talk to Diane in South Carolina.
[01:45:53.652 --> 01:45:54.052]  Go ahead.
[01:45:55.523 --> 01:45:56.584]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:45:57.184 --> 01:46:12.898]  What I wanted to ask Frank about, in 1970 it was called the American Democratic Institute did a program for the government, it's called Overseer, Gatekeeper, and in it they did like the entire Patriot Act was what it was, one and two.
[01:46:13.279 --> 01:46:20.185]  But in there they had in control of the United States at a point we would not have our presidential elections
[01:46:20.583 --> 01:46:26.046]  Because the president would have to quote-unquote, stay in power because of martial law and everything's going on.
[01:46:26.527 --> 01:46:27.987]  You think we're that close to that?
[01:46:28.448 --> 01:46:28.688]  Yep.
[01:46:28.968 --> 01:46:30.109]  And I have one more question.
[01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.230]  Yeah.
[01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:46.598]  I, I, I think, uh, as we were mentioning that the potential for some catastrophic event to cancel out next, uh, election and so forth is there because we can see the, uh, you know, the tone, um,
[01:46:48.284 --> 01:46:57.487]  We got the head of NORTHCOM, the new domestic military unit, saying, yeah, martial law might be needed, folks.
[01:46:57.647 --> 01:46:59.027]  Yeah, it's quite possible.
[01:46:59.147 --> 01:47:13.492]  And as you mentioned, back at that period, the Houston plan, Tom Charles Houston also was concerned with mass detention and martial law or martial rule, what have you, in these kinds of scenarios.
[01:47:13.919 --> 01:47:22.724]  So yeah, no, I think we need to be aware of that possibility and plan on protecting ourselves.
[01:47:22.744 --> 01:47:24.464]  I hope you're paying attention out there, folks.
[01:47:24.504 --> 01:47:26.365]  This is really happening.
[01:47:26.425 --> 01:47:30.347]  And you know, Frank and I didn't just jump up this year and say, oh, look, it's martial law.
[01:47:30.367 --> 01:47:32.829]  Right, it's been planned ever since way back.
[01:47:32.849 --> 01:47:35.070]  I mean, I've been talking about this for nine, ten years.
[01:47:35.150 --> 01:47:38.492]  Frank's been talking about it longer than that, laying out the program.
[01:47:38.512 --> 01:47:39.852]  I mean, we're not making this up.
[01:47:40.313 --> 01:47:43.154]  Well, Alex, you know how they are so big on symbols.
[01:47:43.587 --> 01:47:49.408]  I want you to go to the morning NBC News this morning when they showed the big ball that's going up at Times Square.
[01:47:50.009 --> 01:47:53.590]  It is made of triangles of the Eye of Horus.
[01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:57.090]  With the eye in the middle, the triangle with the rays coming out.
[01:47:57.451 --> 01:48:02.312]  And they were talking about how this generates the most beautiful light in the world.
[01:48:02.412 --> 01:48:06.533]  And they got an insignia on it signifying all the countries of the world.
[01:48:06.833 --> 01:48:11.194]  And he said this is a great step in our world union.
[01:48:11.952 --> 01:48:14.294]  I want you to get the news this morning.
[01:48:15.335 --> 01:48:15.696]  Watch it.
[01:48:15.736 --> 01:48:17.457]  It was on the NBC News this morning.
[01:48:18.918 --> 01:48:19.259]  Thank you.
[01:48:19.299 --> 01:48:19.479]  Bye.
[01:48:19.659 --> 01:48:20.260]  Thank you, Diane.
[01:48:22.979 --> 01:48:26.380]  A facet we haven't really talked about, Frank Morales, is police and military.
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:30.842]  A lot of them I've talked to, especially after they've been in a few years, start waking up to this.
[01:48:30.862 --> 01:48:36.183]  99% of police and firefighters and medical workers refuse a smallpox shot.
[01:48:36.583 --> 01:48:37.644]  They had to suspend that.
[01:48:37.964 --> 01:48:40.945]  How important is it to reach out and educate the police themselves?
[01:48:41.025 --> 01:48:42.245]  I think it's very important.
[01:48:42.885 --> 01:48:45.046]  It's critical.
[01:48:45.646 --> 01:48:49.908]  As I said, when push comes to shove, when the tire hits the road, it's about
[01:48:51.638 --> 01:48:53.379]  You know, our neighbors against neighbors.
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:49:00.165]  You know, yeah, they'll they'll attempt to import people and create some kind of international police forces and so forth.
[01:49:00.625 --> 01:49:08.071]  But ultimately, we need to reach people who are being used as tools in this in this game plan.
[01:49:08.892 --> 01:49:15.497]  Part of the the experience we have recently here at One Police Plaza, we had a press conference right down at police headquarters around
[01:49:16.238 --> 01:49:43.515]  uh... you know banning rubber bullets and and these people and electromagnetic pulse weaponry and all this kind of stuff uh... and a lot of the police people who were there expressed similar desires they don't want to be involved in the so-called uh... uh... civil disturbance suppression operations they want ads in the newspaper saying we apologize we've been ordered to crack down and treat you badly yeah i mean that you know it uh... it's very important that we organize we educate uh... we reach out
[01:49:44.171 --> 01:49:47.154]  Communities need to get familiar with their local police department.
[01:49:47.174 --> 01:49:52.498]  They need to ask police, do you want to be part of slitting America's throat for the big bankers?
[01:49:52.799 --> 01:49:53.719]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:53.779 --> 01:50:12.195]  We need to just be as direct as we can and impress upon them that it's treasonous, the activities of this elite and what they're involved in, and that the dissent is a form of patriotism.
[01:50:12.702 --> 01:50:19.089]  And we're not, you know, it's important for them to make that kind of judgment, but they need to be educated.
[01:50:19.149 --> 01:50:20.170]  We can't sit back.
[01:50:20.566 --> 01:50:27.848]  And allow for this intense media manipulation for these technology transfers, these laws.
[01:50:27.928 --> 01:50:29.368]  We've got to organize.
[01:50:29.528 --> 01:50:40.351]  Well, Frank, just the level of the syrupy, disgusting, again, Running Man type newscast, I think that should wake everybody up.
[01:50:40.571 --> 01:50:41.371]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:41.991 --> 01:50:46.692]  I mean, for somebody who's awake like I am or you are, I mean, how do you handle it?
[01:50:47.433 --> 01:50:48.713]  It drives me up a wall.
[01:50:51.152 --> 01:50:52.092]  Not that much.
[01:50:52.192 --> 01:50:57.273]  I tend not to take in too much of that kind of information, because I realize where it's coming from.
[01:50:58.153 --> 01:51:00.974]  And alternative sources of information, the stuff's out there.
[01:51:01.134 --> 01:51:01.694]  We gotta break.
[01:51:01.714 --> 01:51:02.654]  We'll be right back, Frank.
[01:51:02.674 --> 01:51:03.514]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:51:04.774 --> 01:51:09.115]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:51:09.295 --> 01:51:13.736]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:13.856 --> 01:51:18.237]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:51:18.357 --> 01:51:19.617]  A New World Order.
[01:51:20.558 --> 01:51:22.199]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:35.154 --> 01:51:45.478]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[01:52:15.675 --> 01:52:21.836]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.

[01:52:29.718 --> 01:52:30.158]  I think so.

[01:54:05.658 --> 01:54:08.439]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:54:09.019 --> 01:54:12.340]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:16.862 --> 01:54:20.744]  We got Jack McClam and Colonel Craig Roberts together in the next hour.
[01:54:20.764 --> 01:54:22.904]  I'll get to more of the news we have not yet detailed.
[01:54:25.425 --> 01:54:35.289]  Frank Morales, the White House has been caught, this is admitted, issuing fake terror alerts to quote, create hysteria.
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:44.134]  And the alerts in Arizona, the alerts in France, the alerts in Nevada, the alerts in San Antonio, it's all staged!
[01:54:45.859 --> 01:54:49.201]  And they've been caught doing this yet again, but no one's held accountable.
[01:54:49.481 --> 01:55:02.229]  And then with Iraq, they come out and they tell wild lies, claim they've captured the same person three or four times, get caught lying about that, get caught lying about mass graves, get caught lying about uranium, the Jessica Lynch fable.
[01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:06.151]  They're torturing all these Iraqis and they let us learn about it.
[01:55:06.492 --> 01:55:11.915]  It seems like they're practicing getting caught lying to almost titrate the dose
[01:55:12.535 --> 01:55:14.297]  Or condition us to accept that?
[01:55:14.337 --> 01:55:16.318]  I mean, this is very sophisticated.
[01:55:18.961 --> 01:55:38.677]  I mean, I guess it's a 21st century version of the Big Lie, which is Hitler's approach, which is that you could cover one thing with another thing and another thing, and just a series of lies, and just create a whirlwind of malfeasance and fraudulency.
[01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:53.018]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I agree with that, but as you and I can sit here and see through this, and I'm sure people who are listening right now can see through this, it's really a question of what it is we do about it.
[01:55:53.578 --> 01:55:58.902]  We understand clearly that we're up against a desperate
[01:55:59.946 --> 01:56:05.788]  elite in this country who are involved in an agenda that... Why are they so desperate?
[01:56:05.828 --> 01:56:06.928]  We were leaving them alone.
[01:56:06.988 --> 01:56:07.969]  They had all the power.
[01:56:08.009 --> 01:56:09.249]  Why do they want everything?
[01:56:09.509 --> 01:56:26.835]  Well, I think their projections over the next 25 years quite possibly dictate that unless they remove large portions of the population, unless they contain and control large
[01:56:27.833 --> 01:56:33.855]  Well, we're putting most of it up on the website, because I'm interested in getting this information out to people.
[01:56:54.642 --> 01:56:58.305]  And so if they go to the website, a good chunk of it is on there already.
[01:56:58.325 --> 01:56:59.386]  Well, it's a beautiful book.
[01:56:59.887 --> 01:57:00.688]  How do folks buy it?
[01:57:01.308 --> 01:57:03.070]  They can contact people.
[01:57:03.130 --> 01:57:07.854]  Well, you know, because it's out of print, and we're trying to get them to reprint it.
[01:57:08.274 --> 01:57:13.819]  But if they contact me, I can get them in touch with a new publication.
[01:57:13.859 --> 01:57:17.162]  It's just in the process now of going through a second printing with some other publisher.
[01:57:18.277 --> 01:57:22.859]  But let me give you my email and people can contact me and we'll get them the information.
[01:57:22.919 --> 01:57:26.920]  Or they can actually leave me a note on the website, at our email on the website.
[01:57:27.221 --> 01:57:31.642]  And that's F-R-M at P-A-N-I-X dot com?
[01:57:31.742 --> 01:57:32.243]  Exactly.
[01:57:32.823 --> 01:57:35.064]  Okay, I'm going to give out a gun in the next hour.
[01:57:35.224 --> 01:57:37.345]  Yeah, people can contact me there.
[01:57:37.405 --> 01:57:44.127]  We also have a link on the website for the Urban Warrior movie, which is a documentary on the militarization of the Klingons.
[01:57:44.147 --> 01:57:45.248]  And I believe I'm in that, aren't I?
[01:57:46.596 --> 01:57:47.757]  Alright, that's a great film.
[01:57:48.117 --> 01:57:50.619]  Frank, thanks so much for coming on and I'll talk to you in the New Year.
[01:57:50.659 --> 01:57:53.921]  Yeah, you take care and Happy New Year to you and all the listeners.
[01:57:54.221 --> 01:57:55.061]  God bless, my friend.
[01:57:55.282 --> 01:57:55.722]  Likewise.
[01:57:57.423 --> 01:57:59.204]  He's also an Episcopal priest, folks.
[01:58:00.405 --> 01:58:06.929]  Folks, if you want to support this show, if you believe in what we're doing, please tell ten people a day about the show.
[01:58:06.969 --> 01:58:07.409]  It's easy.
[01:58:08.010 --> 01:58:09.171]  Please buy my videos.
[01:58:09.731 --> 01:58:14.174]  Police State 2000, The Takeover, Police State 3, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:58:14.434 --> 01:58:15.174]  Make copies of them.
[01:58:15.214 --> 01:58:16.035]  I'm the same as Frank.
[01:58:16.832 --> 01:58:19.194]  He says, oh, my whole book's on the website, or almost all of it.
[01:58:19.214 --> 01:58:19.794]  I've seen it there.

[01:58:35.006 --> 01:58:36.307]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:58:36.347 --> 01:58:37.308]  Call right now.
[01:58:43.263 --> 01:58:45.368]  They're trying to set up a military dictatorship!
[01:58:45.608 --> 01:58:46.029]  Fight them!
[01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:47.051]  With the info!
[01:58:47.071 --> 01:58:47.132]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:58:47.152 --> 01:58:48.635]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:48.655 --> 01:58:49.677]  Get those videos.
[01:58:55.257 --> 01:59:05.981]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:59:06.161 --> 01:59:13.703]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:13.943 --> 01:59:14.444]  I don't know.
[01:59:29.952 --> 01:59:33.836]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:59:33.896 --> 01:59:35.798]  The water level is always visible.
[01:59:35.958 --> 01:59:41.904]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:59:42.144 --> 01:59:44.346]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water.
[01:59:44.386 --> 01:59:44.487]  It's $44.38.
[01:59:44.527 --> 01:59:45.728]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.075 --> 02:00:05.238]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:05.898 --> 02:00:06.699]  You want answers?
[02:00:07.479 --> 02:00:08.380]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:12.723]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.223 --> 02:00:17.286]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.792 --> 02:00:53.379]  All right it's the last hour of the last show of 2003 and we had the doctor on in the first hour talking about mad cow disease and just how serious it is how it's in the pigs how it's in the in the lamb and how that's being covered up
[02:00:54.731 --> 02:00:58.613]  And we had Frank Morales, the police state expert, on the last hour.
[02:00:58.653 --> 02:01:01.435]  They are publicly setting up a military dictatorship.
[02:01:01.455 --> 02:01:03.496]  Do you realize how serious this is?
[02:01:03.556 --> 02:01:04.517]  Has it sunk in yet?
[02:01:04.537 --> 02:01:06.438]  We're going to take calls this hour.
[02:01:06.458 --> 02:01:11.741]  We're going to have police and military against the New World Order founder and head, Jack McClam, back on with us.
[02:01:11.921 --> 02:01:13.422]  And my good buddy, Colonel Craig Roberts.
[02:01:13.782 --> 02:01:16.103]  Both are great patriots and great Americans.
[02:01:16.123 --> 02:01:18.905]  Because we had them on last week and ran out of time.
[02:01:18.945 --> 02:01:21.566]  So they'll be with us right into the end of this year.
[02:01:24.565 --> 02:01:27.566]  And we're so honored to have both of these gentlemen.
[02:01:27.586 --> 02:01:37.287]  There's so much news, the fake terror alerts, the fear mongering, a congressman saying nobody should go to any big events, it's not safe, he wouldn't be caught dead doing it.
[02:01:37.847 --> 02:01:40.328]  A lot of key stuff this hour and your calls.
[02:01:41.548 --> 02:01:43.988]  Let's go to Jack McClam, who I know we've got on now.
[02:01:44.068 --> 02:01:45.249]  Jack, good to have you back on.
[02:01:45.489 --> 02:01:50.950]  Hey brothers, good to be back on with you and also our dear brother Craig there.
[02:01:53.564 --> 02:01:57.126]  Jack, you've been warning folks for 22, 23 years.
[02:01:58.007 --> 02:01:59.528]  You've laid out what was going to happen.
[02:01:59.568 --> 02:02:00.568]  It's now happening.
[02:02:01.269 --> 02:02:05.792]  It's got to be painful to watch the entrails of America being torn out.
[02:02:08.093 --> 02:02:15.798]  It's like having a front row seat in the Coliseum and seeing your fellow Christians being eaten by the lions.
[02:02:15.818 --> 02:02:17.539]  I mean, it's just incredible, brother.
[02:02:17.999 --> 02:02:19.760]  As I know you guys feel the same.
[02:02:20.821 --> 02:02:22.442]  We've known for years because
[02:02:22.904 --> 02:02:46.033]  The enemy of God and liberty has explained their plans and made them available, and so we knew what was going to happen, but it is tragic, especially here at Aid in the Bed Police Military Newsletter and Police Against the New World Order, where we're getting mail, just got more mail today from a young brother, Master Sergeant in the Middle East, and it just tears your heart out.
[02:02:46.073 --> 02:02:47.994]  He and a couple of his buddies,
[02:02:48.672 --> 02:02:53.773]  They're trying to be secret patriots over there and trying to hand out information.
[02:02:53.853 --> 02:02:59.295]  They can't hand it out because they get in deep trouble if they find out they're true informed patriots.
[02:02:59.335 --> 02:03:12.779]  So this brother says they have to secretly put things on bulletin boards and leave things in public places where their fellow colleagues will find them to try to help educate them on what's really going on.
[02:03:12.819 --> 02:03:16.059]  And you know, it's amazing.
[02:03:16.099 --> 02:03:17.840]  This is American soldiers.
[02:03:18.382 --> 02:03:30.057]  They can't even talk about the Constitution, can't talk about their oath of office, what they should be doing and what they shouldn't be doing, and talking about this conspiracy to destroy the United States of America.
[02:03:31.038 --> 02:03:32.060]  It just breaks your heart.
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:33.842]  Just absolutely breaks your heart.
[02:03:34.741 --> 02:03:38.406]  Well, I want to talk about solutions today and get a little bit into Mad Cubs.
[02:03:38.426 --> 02:03:39.947]  We didn't have time to do that last time.
[02:03:39.967 --> 02:03:43.432]  We're about to break, but let's bring Colonel Craig Roberts up.
[02:03:44.113 --> 02:03:47.336]  Craig, what's on your mind today here at the final show of this year?
[02:03:47.937 --> 02:03:51.822]  Oh, well, you know, Alex, it's always good to be back with you and, of course, Jack.
[02:03:51.842 --> 02:03:53.424]  Jack and I go back a long time.
[02:03:54.148 --> 02:03:55.828]  And a couple of things.
[02:03:56.569 --> 02:04:05.771]  I've got all kinds of stuff on this mad cow that we didn't get a chance to talk about because I don't think people realize how serious it is and how long it's been here and how many people actually have died from it and what's been done to cover it up.
[02:04:05.811 --> 02:04:07.471]  And I've got all that information for them today.
[02:04:08.071 --> 02:04:13.452]  But also, Jack was talking about how hard it is to disseminate information inside the military.
[02:04:13.913 --> 02:04:19.854]  But it's amazing that if you can just get it in, how far it goes, especially overseas where there's not a lot of reading material.
[02:04:20.316 --> 02:04:34.118]  I sent a case of my book, The Medusophile, to a friend of mine who's a Lieutenant Colonel in Special Forces in Afghanistan, and he hand-carried him out to different individuals of various ranks who have loaned him to places all over the country, and I get emails from these guys.
[02:04:35.142 --> 02:04:36.803]  It's found its way into foxholes and the mountains.
[02:04:36.923 --> 02:04:39.584]  It's absolutely incredible what happens if you can just get it to them.
[02:04:39.684 --> 02:04:47.146]  And if we could just get your books and Jack's books and newsletters and videos and my videos to half these people, we would win overnight.
[02:04:47.626 --> 02:04:49.607]  We have the force to do it.
[02:04:49.867 --> 02:04:50.827]  We have the tools.
[02:04:51.147 --> 02:04:52.647]  We've just got to have the will.
[02:04:52.928 --> 02:04:54.348]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:56.499 --> 02:05:00.844]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:05:01.044 --> 02:05:05.430]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:05:05.610 --> 02:05:09.995]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:05:10.035 --> 02:05:11.376]  The New World Order.
[02:05:12.298 --> 02:05:13.939]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:26.894 --> 02:05:37.222]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:37.502 --> 02:05:42.866]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:05:43.386 --> 02:05:47.169]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:05:47.449 --> 02:05:48.450]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:55.931 --> 02:05:59.172]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:05:59.252 --> 02:06:03.413]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:06:03.673 --> 02:06:06.474]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:06:06.654 --> 02:06:09.055]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:06:09.255 --> 02:06:17.897]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:06:18.097 --> 02:06:19.438]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[02:06:19.638 --> 02:06:23.879]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:06:24.039 --> 02:06:24.559]  We're good to go!
[02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:47.836]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:06:47.876 --> 02:06:48.677]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:06:55.666 --> 02:07:00.328]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first-ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.

[02:07:33.307 --> 02:07:34.347]  Not if, but when.

[02:07:51.617 --> 02:07:51.857]  P.O.
[02:07:51.877 --> 02:07:53.637]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[02:08:01.059 --> 02:08:01.699]  Big Brother.
[02:08:02.359 --> 02:08:03.399]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:05.220]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:06.680]  You want answers?
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:08.380]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:12.741]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.201 --> 02:08:15.542]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:08:16.443 --> 02:08:17.304]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:18.204 --> 02:08:19.405]  That's right, my friends.
[02:08:20.746 --> 02:08:27.952]  Live from Austin, Texas, there's so much I want to cover as quickly as possible in this final hour of the year.
[02:08:27.972 --> 02:08:32.516]  I don't want to jam some calls in in the second half hour.
[02:08:32.536 --> 02:08:38.120]  I want to get into Mad Cow because Colonel Roberts has had some personal experience with friends and family with this.
[02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:43.344]  I want to get into the police state in the New World Order with Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order.
[02:08:44.082 --> 02:09:03.509]  But Colonel Roberts, you just mentioned how you sent a case of your excellent book, Medusafile, that gives us a broad view of the New World Order and case point examples, and how it got to the Special Forces, your friend in Special Forces, and now has gone all over the world with multiple people reading it in foxholes in Afghanistan, learning about the big picture.
[02:09:04.923 --> 02:09:11.649]  The power of, and I thank God every day for this, of just what I've done in the last nine years.
[02:09:13.050 --> 02:09:31.324]  The thousands of radio interviews, the show, the videos, to go on shows in places I'm not on the radio, and people call in who've seen the films because somebody gave them a copy, and the churches that are waking up, and the millions, the millions that have woken up because of Jack McClam and his newsletter for twenty-plus years.
[02:09:32.975 --> 02:09:38.421]  I want to talk about force a multiplication of information and I want people to order your books.
[02:09:38.461 --> 02:09:43.406]  I want people to support Jack McClam and I didn't even intend to do this but this is such a key
[02:09:46.202 --> 02:09:56.294]  I'm no fan of the Ayatollahs in Iran, but the Ayatollah Khamenei came to power with copies of audio cassettes, copies of copies of copies of copies.
[02:09:56.334 --> 02:09:57.415]  Well, we're the good guys.
[02:09:57.735 --> 02:09:59.137]  We're trying to do the same thing.
[02:09:59.638 --> 02:10:01.420]  And where there's a will, there's a way.
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:02.922]  We know this is working.
[02:10:03.522 --> 02:10:06.643]  But enough people haven't decided to do that.
[02:10:06.723 --> 02:10:14.447]  They've let the will of the New World Order scare them into submission that you can't affect change, that you can't get things done.
[02:10:14.667 --> 02:10:22.250]  Well, isn't that classical enemy-type Tokyo Rose type programming?
[02:10:22.450 --> 02:10:28.713]  Gentlemen, comments from both of you about the power of our materials that are so accurate and so good.
[02:10:29.093 --> 02:10:32.655]  And I mean, all three of us, we've got the track record here.
[02:10:33.315 --> 02:10:34.556]  Talk about that, both of you.
[02:10:34.756 --> 02:10:37.838]  Okay, let me do something first.
[02:10:38.438 --> 02:10:39.198]  I don't want to forget it.
[02:10:39.318 --> 02:10:40.699]  It's extremely important.
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:43.881]  This is absolutely correct.
[02:10:43.921 --> 02:10:51.285]  If you can get the material in front of people, and if they'll just sit down long enough to look at it or read it, it's like fishing.
[02:10:51.325 --> 02:10:53.966]  You cast a bait, and sooner or later you're going to catch something.
[02:10:54.586 --> 02:10:59.249]  You can chum the water all day long and just catch a few fish, but they're important fish when you catch them.
[02:11:00.087 --> 02:11:05.911]  You know, it was said that if you can convince one person, they can convince two, and they can convince four, then you win.
[02:11:06.812 --> 02:11:10.114]  And this is what we've done, but there's a battle being fought against us.
[02:11:10.174 --> 02:11:12.575]  And just as an example, this is brand new.
[02:11:12.676 --> 02:11:13.676]  You're hearing it here first.
[02:11:14.777 --> 02:11:16.778]  I tried to ship some books over to Iraq.
[02:11:18.279 --> 02:11:26.885]  I went to a small country post office, and the lady there, as soon as she saw the address, she had a checklist that she had to go down, and she said, are there any Bibles in here?
[02:11:27.461 --> 02:11:28.582]  I said, no, there's no Bibles.
[02:11:28.622 --> 02:11:31.803]  Well, is there any religious material having to do with Christianity in here?
[02:11:32.343 --> 02:11:33.724]  I said, no, not really.
[02:11:33.784 --> 02:11:34.084]  Why?
[02:11:34.164 --> 02:11:36.145]  She said, well, we can't send that to these countries.
[02:11:36.205 --> 02:11:36.745]  I said, wait a minute.
[02:11:37.305 --> 02:11:38.866]  I'm sending this to an APO.
[02:11:39.226 --> 02:11:41.888]  That's an Army Post Office in New York.
[02:11:42.388 --> 02:11:43.568]  And I'm not sending it overseas.
[02:11:43.588 --> 02:11:44.889]  It's going to an Army Post Office.
[02:11:44.929 --> 02:11:49.271]  Yes, but this APO number says it's going to go to Iraq or to a Middle Eastern country.
[02:11:49.311 --> 02:11:51.712]  And because of that, you cannot send any Christian material.
[02:11:51.772 --> 02:11:52.812]  You cannot send any Bibles.
[02:11:53.033 --> 02:11:53.873]  I said, wait a minute.
[02:11:54.542 --> 02:11:55.583]  We just won the war!
[02:11:55.623 --> 02:11:59.024]  We just got these guys over there, according to our government, and they've taken over the place.
[02:11:59.064 --> 02:11:59.544]  They run it.
[02:11:59.584 --> 02:12:03.426]  It's going to an American guy in an American base camp.
[02:12:03.446 --> 02:12:05.747]  What difference does it make if there's a Bible in that chapel?
[02:12:05.767 --> 02:12:07.568]  Well, Craig, Saddam allowed Bibles!
[02:12:07.768 --> 02:12:08.348]  Oh, absolutely!
[02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:09.469]  But here I'm on U.S.
[02:12:09.509 --> 02:12:13.431]  Post Office, and she looked at me, and she said very quietly, she said, it's going to get worse.
[02:12:13.491 --> 02:12:14.131]  I said, what do you mean?
[02:12:14.551 --> 02:12:18.193]  She said, we're already having meetings on what we're going to do
[02:12:18.743 --> 02:12:30.188]  If the ACLU decides to sue the post office and bar us from being a government information in allowing anyone to send any Bibles or religious material anywhere to a government post office.
[02:12:30.688 --> 02:12:32.689]  Now that means I can't send you one in Texas!
[02:12:32.869 --> 02:12:35.650]  So this is, again, the secret policing of the mail.
[02:12:36.730 --> 02:12:39.191]  Please continue, I don't want to get Jack McClam's comment on this.
[02:12:41.572 --> 02:12:43.673]  So where does it go from there, Jack?
[02:12:46.446 --> 02:12:57.849]  You know, we've watched for many years now, decades, as the American people have become active in trying to inform their neighbors on what's going on.
[02:12:58.829 --> 02:13:01.349]  And we have reached millions and millions.
[02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:12.852]  We know, and it's a fact, that when we get one of our police and military constitutional publications in the hand of one of our brothers and sisters actively on duty,
[02:13:13.675 --> 02:13:15.415]  And either the military or law enforcement.
[02:13:15.455 --> 02:13:22.097]  It is shown to best friends first and then it gets around, you know, it gets around handed to others.
[02:13:22.497 --> 02:13:39.300]  And so it's a multiple effect that is incredible because we have people mailing us copies of newsletters that look like 10th generation copies of some of our constitutional articles and all that's written by law enforcement and military people.
[02:13:40.197 --> 02:14:00.244]  And so, you're right, it's just incredible what happens when the people will get active and take a tape, just one tape of Alex Jones, or one of our newsletters, or one of Craig's books, or articles, new website pages, and make copies of that and just get it out, get it out to people.
[02:14:00.804 --> 02:14:06.746]  It's amazing the duplicate effect it has, doubling effect it has, tripling effect.
[02:14:07.304 --> 02:14:09.245]  So that's the answer to this.
[02:14:09.745 --> 02:14:18.988]  But we should also remember that the communists have always said that never underestimate the power of a small group of committed citizens to change the world.
[02:14:19.028 --> 02:14:20.388]  It's the only thing that ever has.
[02:14:21.429 --> 02:14:25.870]  And Samuel Adams reminds us that it never takes the majority to prevail.
[02:14:25.890 --> 02:14:28.451]  A minority can prevail.
[02:14:28.511 --> 02:14:32.612]  And so we don't have to have all the people educated out there.
[02:14:33.052 --> 02:14:35.173]  We just have to have a certain amount
[02:14:35.734 --> 02:14:40.795]  That we'll stand up and speak out for justice and liberty in this country to take our nation back.
[02:14:40.875 --> 02:14:47.337]  So it is not something that is not possible.
[02:14:47.497 --> 02:15:00.500]  It is possible to do this, and we just need all the listeners out there to get your tapes, Alex, to get the books of Craig and our newsletters and go to our websites and
[02:15:01.024 --> 02:15:04.448]  Well, first of all, get a hold of us at our all-volunteer Police and Military Association, including this old cop.
[02:15:16.323 --> 02:15:44.231]  and get a copy of our publication a debate police military newsletter and make copies of it nothing is uh... you know uh... copyrighted and get it out in the hands of your friends and relatives because every two people out there listening today have a friend or or or a family member that did law enforcement or the military so just get out our publication because we have a uh... a motto here saying that
[02:15:44.898 --> 02:15:45.258]  I don't
[02:16:02.051 --> 02:16:02.812]  Thanks for having me.
[02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:21.531]  And protect the constitutional rights of people and so forth.
[02:16:21.771 --> 02:16:24.893]  Okay, so what, give folks the contact info.
[02:16:25.233 --> 02:16:40.819]  Okay, they can get a hold of us here at Adenabeth Police Military Newsletter, that's the best place to start, and write to us here at HC, like Henry Charles, 11, Box 357, like the good old Magnum I carried on duty for 20-some years.
[02:16:41.759 --> 02:16:44.400]  And that's Kami, I-K-A-M-I-A-H.
[02:16:47.236 --> 02:16:55.417]  Idaho 83536, that's HC11, Box 357, Kamii, Idaho 83536.
[02:16:56.238 --> 02:17:11.620]  If you can, send us three bucks and we'll be able to fund our postage and reprint our newsletters and we'll send you out a copy if you'd like to get on our mailing list or buy a subscription for a police officer or soldier that you know.
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:15.721]  Just a $25 donation and we'll get that out to them regularly.
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:21.163]  And begin their educational process to get them back on the side of God and the Constitution.
[02:17:21.323 --> 02:17:23.864]  Absolutely, and this is powerful info, Craig.
[02:17:25.225 --> 02:17:37.292]  Over on my site right now, my webmaster has put up several links to some Mad Cow articles, if people want to run over there and look at that real quick, because we're going to get a little bit, they'll have a little bit of a handle on what we're going to talk about.
[02:17:37.912 --> 02:17:43.515]  He's posted four or five good links to some really fascinating articles on Mad Cow disease, and that's at Rifle Warrior.
[02:17:43.973 --> 02:18:03.545]  It's www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarrior.com www.riflewarri
[02:18:09.762 --> 02:18:18.146]  Medusafile, remember folks, if you can't get it to bookstores, it's because it's available, but they keep pulling it out of the computers, they keep trying to blacklist it.
[02:18:18.166 --> 02:18:19.407]  And you're a best-selling author.
[02:18:19.587 --> 02:18:22.088]  It's not like you're some guy going, oh, they don't like me.
[02:18:22.648 --> 02:18:27.571]  In fact, I've got a new book coming out this summer called Crosshairs on the Kill Zone that follows up One Shot, One Kill.
[02:18:29.071 --> 02:18:34.274]  One Shot, One Kill is a best-seller and it's in like 14th printing, and this is the book that's going to follow on to that one.
[02:18:34.608 --> 02:18:35.429]  We're good to go.
[02:18:47.145 --> 02:18:47.726]  Amazing.
[02:18:47.866 --> 02:18:54.911]  And folks, I'm not here belaboring the info that Jack McClam has and that Colonel Roberts has for no reason.
[02:18:56.513 --> 02:18:58.274]  I'm not making anything out of this.
[02:18:58.594 --> 02:19:00.896]  I'm doing it because I believe in what they're doing.
[02:19:00.976 --> 02:19:02.457]  I know it's accurate info.
[02:19:03.218 --> 02:19:07.441]  And if you don't buy my videos, you don't get their books, you don't get their newsletters, you're crazy.
[02:19:07.762 --> 02:19:09.703]  And by the way, Jack's got a long website name.
[02:19:09.743 --> 02:19:14.667]  Just type Police and Military Against the New World Order or Jack McClam into a website and it'll be one of the top links.
[02:19:14.787 --> 02:19:15.608]  Great website.
[02:19:16.683 --> 02:19:19.003]  And we've got a few minutes for the break here.
[02:19:19.284 --> 02:19:21.664]  Let's launch into Mad Cow, because this is a serious issue.
[02:19:22.284 --> 02:19:24.544]  Colonel Roberts, your personal experience with it.
[02:19:25.145 --> 02:19:32.606]  Well, Alex, you and I discussed this some time back, so you can bear witness that this isn't something that we just started.
[02:19:33.286 --> 02:19:38.727]  It has to do with the death of a dear friend of mine from Mad Cow disease about two and a half years ago in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[02:19:38.747 --> 02:19:42.768]  When we get back from the break, I'll give you his name, I'll give you what happened to him, and I'll tell you how they covered it up.
[02:19:42.968 --> 02:19:44.368]  And also, your wife's family.
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:46.782]  My mother-in-law, absolutely.
[02:19:47.223 --> 02:19:49.708]  We'll be back, folks, and then we'll get into the police state.
[02:19:49.768 --> 02:19:52.474]  General Eberhardt's comments, and take your calls.
[02:19:52.494 --> 02:19:54.999]  We'll talk about Franks as well.
[02:19:56.730 --> 02:20:00.311]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:20:00.651 --> 02:20:04.171]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[02:20:57.227 --> 02:20:58.087]  You've searched for it.
[02:20:58.267 --> 02:20:58.967]  We have it.
[02:20:59.128 --> 02:21:00.728]  I'm talking about Coral Calcium.

[02:22:04.217 --> 02:22:17.201]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:22:17.481 --> 02:22:20.802]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:22:21.142 --> 02:22:25.884]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light,
[02:22:26.304 --> 02:22:31.587]  All night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:22:31.887 --> 02:22:32.388]  That's right!
[02:22:32.568 --> 02:22:39.692]  Incredibly your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[02:23:06.754 --> 02:23:10.415]  You wouldn't make any vitamin D nor any bile to digest fatty foods.
[02:23:10.735 --> 02:23:12.475]  This is health journalist Bill Sardi.
[02:23:12.535 --> 02:23:15.456]  Cholesterol is not a life-threatening toxin.
[02:23:15.696 --> 02:23:21.698]  Despite efforts to reduce cholesterol and fats in your diet, your liver will make about a glass full of cholesterol a day.
[02:23:21.918 --> 02:23:25.359]  The bottom line is we need to maintain healthy cholesterol levels.
[02:23:25.619 --> 02:23:30.540]  That's just what Lifespan Nutrition has done with its revolutionary Normatrol formula.
[02:23:30.979 --> 02:23:37.023]  It provides potent amounts of lecithin along with rice bran, flaxseed, taurine, boron, and magnesium.

[02:24:01.326 --> 02:24:03.228]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:24:03.728 --> 02:24:06.531]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:24:08.433 --> 02:24:13.318]  Coming up, we're going to talk about the military dictatorship, which they're now announcing they're publicly setting up.
[02:24:13.338 --> 02:24:16.401]  9-11 was only the setup for all of this.
[02:24:17.382 --> 02:24:18.243]  The preparation.
[02:24:19.524 --> 02:24:20.545]  The firing cap.
[02:24:22.373 --> 02:24:23.354]  It is so serious.
[02:24:23.474 --> 02:24:29.357]  And your calls in the next segment, Rodney in Connecticut and others, be patient.
[02:24:29.377 --> 02:24:29.617]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:29.637 --> 02:24:36.381]  I also want to talk about just the sheer evil of the New World Order that the average person just isn't conscious of, but is documented.
[02:24:37.482 --> 02:24:39.663]  And both you guys jump in any time here.
[02:24:40.204 --> 02:24:42.745]  I talked to a scientist doctor in the first hour.
[02:24:43.245 --> 02:24:45.006]  We've known about Mad Cow for a long time.
[02:24:45.026 --> 02:24:45.807]  They've covered it up.
[02:24:46.696 --> 02:24:50.418]  About two and a half to three years ago, a friend of ours named Jim Hale, who was a mechanic at American Airlines,
[02:25:10.031 --> 02:25:12.713]  He started getting sick and he didn't know what was wrong.
[02:25:12.753 --> 02:25:14.335]  He started losing coordination.
[02:25:14.395 --> 02:25:17.718]  He started having problems remembering things and so on.
[02:25:17.738 --> 02:25:21.941]  He had the classic symptoms of what at that time we figured was Alzheimer's.
[02:25:21.981 --> 02:25:24.544]  The only problem is the guy was only like 48 years old.
[02:25:25.525 --> 02:25:26.325]  He was in good health.
[02:25:26.345 --> 02:25:27.907]  There didn't seem to be anything else wrong with him.
[02:25:27.927 --> 02:25:32.250]  He was on all kinds of health food regimens and took all of his vitamins and herbs and everything.
[02:25:32.291 --> 02:25:37.275]  His wife and him were really, in fact, they were into selling these products and they were really into health.
[02:25:38.728 --> 02:25:52.598]  But he kept going downhill and downhill and finally he got to the point where they had to put him in the hospital and he started getting into extreme stages of what they said was Alzheimer's disease and of course our questions were how could a guy this young have Alzheimer's?
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:26:02.606]  He eventually died from it within a very short period of time after exhibiting the worst symptoms that show up.
[02:26:04.253 --> 02:26:10.218]  Inability to think and remember, can't move, shakiness, can't hardly walk, can't grip your hands, all of that stuff.
[02:26:10.819 --> 02:26:11.659]  And he died at St.
[02:26:11.699 --> 02:26:13.461]  Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[02:26:13.661 --> 02:26:15.763]  That's been almost three years ago now.
[02:26:16.563 --> 02:26:26.471]  And his wife was notified by one of the doctors at the hospital who was a whistleblower that said, your husband did not die from Alzheimer's.
[02:26:27.472 --> 02:26:27.933]  He said that
[02:26:29.018 --> 02:26:30.679]  Normally Alzheimer's doesn't kill you anyway.
[02:26:30.699 --> 02:26:32.440]  What happens is something else happens to your body.
[02:26:32.460 --> 02:26:34.341]  You lose your immune system, your heart goes, whatever.
[02:26:34.381 --> 02:26:37.082]  But he died because his brain ceased to function.
[02:26:37.642 --> 02:26:42.785]  And when they did the autopsy, what they found was Croutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
[02:26:42.845 --> 02:26:43.685]  And she said, what's that?
[02:26:43.765 --> 02:26:46.127]  He says it's mad cow disease, but they won't call it that.
[02:26:47.067 --> 02:26:54.791]  And it's interesting to note, by the way, that Dr. Alzheimer in 19, I think it was 1905, discovered Alzheimer's disease.
[02:26:55.556 --> 02:27:01.100]  As being in the population, which previous to 1900, you'd hardly ever heard of anybody getting Alzheimer's.
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:09.445]  And by the way, we have the doctor on, we've read the mainstream articles, it's now even the Associated Press, people under 30 getting Alzheimer's has quintupled.
[02:27:10.106 --> 02:27:12.227]  It didn't exist before, now it's all over the place.
[02:27:12.327 --> 02:27:24.816]  Right, but before the 1800s, we didn't have cancer, we didn't have Alzheimer's before 1900, and now all of a sudden we start discovering these things around the turn of the century and afterwards when we start getting inoculations and more different types of
[02:27:25.755 --> 02:27:26.556]  I don't know.
[02:27:41.417 --> 02:27:51.422]  So that became, the brain spongiform disease became Crowsfield-Yakub disease, and that's what they called it in humans, but in animals they called it other things depending on what animal it was.
[02:27:51.462 --> 02:27:54.643]  You know, pigs have a form of it, and I used to have the list in front of me.
[02:27:54.663 --> 02:27:56.044]  I don't have it right now, but you can look it up.
[02:27:57.024 --> 02:28:06.349]  Each animal has this type of disease here recently that you can actually find in the population of that livestock, and what they've done is the British, of course,
[02:28:07.213 --> 02:28:13.695]  I had it really bad long before we showed it being here, even though it had been here for a while in the elk herd, and then finally into the cow herd.
[02:28:14.295 --> 02:28:22.098]  And they found out that what it was, it was feeding animal parts back to animals.
[02:28:22.718 --> 02:28:26.239]  And now I've got horses, I've got chickens here, and I read the feed bags.
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:33.682]  And when we first got the animals, I started looking at feed bags, and I found out what companies produced feed made from rendered animal parts
[02:28:34.293 --> 02:28:37.877]  Uh, put back into pellet form and fed back to the animals, which they're not supposed to eat that.
[02:28:37.897 --> 02:28:43.982]  They're designed to be herbivores and not, uh, not eat protein, not eat, uh, the, uh, uh, different types of rendered animal parts.
[02:28:44.042 --> 02:28:45.043]  Cows aren't supposed to eat that.
[02:28:45.063 --> 02:28:48.206]  You start feeding them something they're not supposed to have, bad things happen, and this is what's happening.
[02:28:48.547 --> 02:28:51.209]  And now we've had a massive cover-up.
[02:28:51.309 --> 02:28:52.891]  Uh, Jack McClam comments on this.
[02:28:54.049 --> 02:29:07.759]  Well, you know, for ten years I toured with the Preparedness Expos and one of my bright spots was meeting and speaking along with Lenny Horowitz, Dr. Lenny Horowitz.
[02:29:08.439 --> 02:29:13.603]  And he's done some of the best research in some of the production of these
[02:29:14.679 --> 02:29:15.280]  I don't know.
[02:29:35.288 --> 02:29:38.631]  And so, uh, you know, I have a lot to say about these things.
[02:29:38.651 --> 02:29:40.092]  We'll talk about it when we get back, then.
[02:29:40.132 --> 02:29:43.374]  Then we'll shift gears into the police state and take your calls.
[02:29:43.534 --> 02:29:44.535]  Gentlemen, stay with us.
[02:29:46.977 --> 02:29:47.878]  We're on the march.
[02:29:48.378 --> 02:29:49.979]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:50.900 --> 02:29:53.602]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.068 --> 02:29:59.431]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:29:59.671 --> 02:30:03.516]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:30:03.837 --> 02:30:04.658]  Read the labels.
[02:30:05.098 --> 02:30:09.203]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:30:09.444 --> 02:30:13.589]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:30:13.989 --> 02:30:18.872]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:30:19.253 --> 02:30:22.775]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:30:23.035 --> 02:30:28.379]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:30:28.639 --> 02:30:31.361]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:30:31.661 --> 02:30:32.562]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:30:56.784 --> 02:31:00.048]  Hi, this is Jack Browner with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[02:31:00.508 --> 02:31:02.530]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.

[02:31:12.581 --> 02:31:18.708]  We have $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I've seen in my 24 years in the business.
[02:31:19.148 --> 02:31:25.693]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[02:31:25.913 --> 02:31:29.476]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[02:31:29.716 --> 02:31:33.159]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[02:31:33.579 --> 02:31:35.881]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[02:31:36.221 --> 02:31:37.062]  Do it now.
[02:31:37.302 --> 02:31:46.669]  That's $10 collector gold coins, $10 and $20 collector gold coins at the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.

[02:31:55.728 --> 02:31:56.308]  You've heard of it.
[02:31:56.388 --> 02:31:57.268]  You've searched for it.
[02:31:57.429 --> 02:31:58.149]  We have it.
[02:31:58.289 --> 02:31:59.909]  I'm talking about Coral Calcium.

[02:33:15.389 --> 02:33:19.311]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Rhode Island to Los Angeles, California.

[02:33:35.329 --> 02:33:36.410]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:36.890 --> 02:33:40.733]  This is our final 26 minutes now in this year's shows.
[02:33:41.519 --> 02:33:44.901]  And we're talking to Colonel Craig Roberts and of course Jack McClam.
[02:33:44.921 --> 02:33:47.042]  We're about to go back to both these gentlemen.
[02:33:47.082 --> 02:33:48.243]  I know we got loaded phone lines.
[02:33:48.263 --> 02:33:48.883]  We'll get to those too.
[02:33:48.923 --> 02:33:50.164]  I want to finish up with Mad Cow.
[02:33:50.424 --> 02:33:51.624]  Then get into Police State.
[02:33:52.145 --> 02:33:56.607]  Our guest predictions for the next 365 days.
[02:33:57.788 --> 02:34:03.651]  Before we cover that plethora of info, I want to encourage all of you to get my films.
[02:34:03.871 --> 02:34:05.111]  I've made 10 videos.
[02:34:05.712 --> 02:34:07.513]  The latest is Matrix of Evil.
[02:34:07.533 --> 02:34:09.033]  It has Colonel Craig Roberts in it.
[02:34:09.093 --> 02:34:09.854]  Frank Morales.
[02:34:10.832 --> 02:34:17.974]  Congressman Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, she talks about the UN being a bunch of murderers and kidnapping children and 9-11.
[02:34:18.595 --> 02:34:19.735]  That'll wake the liberals up.
[02:34:19.755 --> 02:34:26.677]  We got Ron Paul talking about globalists running Washington, the neocons, the coming depression.
[02:34:27.458 --> 02:34:28.418]  Pretty powerful stuff.
[02:34:28.798 --> 02:34:29.498]  I'm in there.
[02:34:30.459 --> 02:34:32.759]  It's a great new video, a little over two hours long.
[02:34:33.059 --> 02:34:37.621]  There's police state, three total enslavement, masters of terror, 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[02:34:39.233 --> 02:34:42.397]  All my films are excellent, and you need to have them.
[02:34:42.417 --> 02:34:47.623]  They're $25.95 apiece, $20 when you order three or more, and that purchase also supports this show.
[02:34:47.923 --> 02:34:48.864]  That's a side issue.
[02:34:49.245 --> 02:34:52.508]  Get them because they're effective, they're documented, okay?
[02:34:53.049 --> 02:34:54.210]  And they're waking people up.
[02:34:54.290 --> 02:34:56.813]  So get the films, make at least ten copies.
[02:34:56.893 --> 02:34:57.314]  It's easy.
[02:34:57.814 --> 02:35:06.237]  Ten nights, pop in another tape by another VCR, make a copy, give it to police chiefs, sheriffs, county commissioners, local talk show hosts.
[02:35:06.797 --> 02:35:12.580]  Those are the big fish we're going after, because they're already going to know everything we tell them, but they never want to put it all together.
[02:35:13.140 --> 02:35:17.041]  You see, they're just kind of unconsciously looking at the world.
[02:35:17.421 --> 02:35:23.844]  We just take that hidden image that was already in plain view out into the open, and now no matter what they try, they're still going to see it.
[02:35:24.384 --> 02:35:26.985]  That's all we're doing is widening their perspective.
[02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:29.781]  Get the videos, folks.
[02:35:29.821 --> 02:35:31.101]  They're so important.
[02:35:31.441 --> 02:35:32.402]  Get the videos.
[02:35:32.442 --> 02:35:33.822]  Get my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:35:33.842 --> 02:35:37.364]  Get the new book I published, Order Out of Chaos, by Paul Watson.
[02:35:37.424 --> 02:35:38.124]  It's excellent.
[02:35:38.564 --> 02:35:44.647]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll-free to order them.
[02:35:45.107 --> 02:35:47.988]  And operators are there 24 hours a day, morning, noon, and night, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:55.143 --> 02:36:12.487]  That's 888-253-3139, or just write to me, and I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:36:14.467 --> 02:36:16.707]  And for those that have gotten the films, I want to thank you.
[02:36:17.107 --> 02:36:18.368]  Please keep making copies.
[02:36:18.408 --> 02:36:19.928]  Continue to air them on AXS TV.
[02:36:20.548 --> 02:36:24.449]  Believe me, if we weren't out here doing this, we'd be in a lot worse shape today.
[02:36:25.089 --> 02:36:28.653]  Going back to Jack McClam and Craig Roberts.
[02:36:29.955 --> 02:36:30.876]  Exactly, Jack.
[02:36:30.916 --> 02:36:32.117]  They create the crisis.
[02:36:32.137 --> 02:36:33.459]  They allow it to take place.
[02:36:33.879 --> 02:36:34.800]  Then there's solution.
[02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:35.701]  I have it today.
[02:36:36.202 --> 02:36:38.705]  They want to put microchips by law on all the cattle.
[02:36:39.631 --> 02:36:42.832]  They want to have federal enforcers in all your farms and ranches.
[02:36:43.212 --> 02:36:46.393]  Meanwhile, big agribusiness, it's like Tyson Chicken.
[02:36:46.813 --> 02:36:49.594]  They can have 1,300 violations at one plant.
[02:36:49.834 --> 02:36:52.055]  Their competitor has two and gets shut down.
[02:36:52.615 --> 02:36:53.736]  Nothing happens to them.
[02:36:54.376 --> 02:36:55.756]  That's what I see coming out of this.
[02:36:55.796 --> 02:36:57.077]  What do you see happening, Jack?
[02:36:57.317 --> 02:36:59.177]  Brother, that's absolutely correct.
[02:36:59.458 --> 02:37:03.879]  I've been blessed over 20 years now of knowing some of the
[02:37:04.451 --> 02:37:27.663]  Most knowledgeable doctors in the country, medical personnel, you guys know them too, Dr. Stan Monteith and Dr., like I said, Lenny Horowitz and many others who have pinpointed the fact that there is a biological war going on on the American people and has been for a long time using biological and chemical weapons on our people.
[02:37:28.383 --> 02:37:30.264]  And they use it for everything.
[02:37:30.364 --> 02:37:32.225]  They use it to strike fear.
[02:37:33.047 --> 02:37:42.635]  In the minds of all Americans, they're using it to take over and destroy the small farms and ranches and turn them over to the agribusinesses, which are the international elite.
[02:37:43.055 --> 02:37:47.799]  And these are soft kill weapons that they can misdiagnose, correct, Craig?
[02:37:48.379 --> 02:37:48.940]  Absolutely.
[02:37:49.780 --> 02:37:56.686]  And you know, it's absolutely incredible that even when we, locally, get something diagnosed,
[02:37:58.134 --> 02:38:06.738]  You know, you can take just about anything that's cropped up in this country that got headlines, such as Legionnaire's disease and of course SARS and all of this.
[02:38:06.778 --> 02:38:11.401]  Anytime that they get this stuff, it becomes like the disease of the week and then it goes away under the carpet.
[02:38:11.421 --> 02:38:12.541]  Don't worry about it anymore.
[02:38:13.062 --> 02:38:16.383]  But it has an impact on the population and won't quit.
[02:38:16.423 --> 02:38:23.167]  When we had this latest outbreak of flu, I was doing a radio talk show in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and a guy called in.
[02:38:23.287 --> 02:38:26.709]  He worked at the local hospital and he said that they've reported three flu deaths
[02:38:27.565 --> 02:38:31.088]  In Arkansas, he said, we had nine in our hospital alone in the last two weeks.
[02:38:31.528 --> 02:38:35.991]  So a lot of this stuff goes underreported for various reasons, of course.
[02:38:36.512 --> 02:38:41.315]  But one thing that I always suspect, because I always look at the other side of the door anymore.
[02:38:41.555 --> 02:38:43.697]  I look in the shadows to see what the real truth is.
[02:38:44.337 --> 02:38:53.003]  And I always suspect that, I wonder how much, especially after writing the Medusa file, with all of the research we did and all the investigations we did at the government,
[02:38:53.527 --> 02:38:53.888]  I think?
[02:39:11.563 --> 02:39:19.266]  And how much of this stuff happens in your local town that you know about, and the locals know about, but it never goes uphill and gets reported in the national media?
[02:39:19.286 --> 02:39:27.230]  Well, that's the point I've made, is we have Project Shad up until 85, nerve-gassing troops and killing them, and then no one is charged because they were quote, following orders.
[02:39:27.730 --> 02:39:36.034]  I mean, we have a ruthless group of criminals running things, and Jack McClam, Craig Roberts, I want to briefly, and then I want to get into the militarization of police and some calls.
[02:39:36.654 --> 02:39:38.175]  Your predictions for the next year,
[02:39:39.075 --> 02:39:45.197]  What you see happening, and also I want to talk about the nature of evil, what the New World Order really is.
[02:39:46.737 --> 02:39:47.277]  Go ahead, Jack.
[02:39:47.577 --> 02:39:48.198]  Okay, brother.
[02:39:48.398 --> 02:40:00.561]  Well, our police association here, our main concern is that acts of terrorism used on the American people works miracles for the internationalists.
[02:40:01.141 --> 02:40:07.783]  So we see in this next year, horrible acts of terrorism are going to be used on the American people.
[02:40:08.579 --> 02:40:09.740]  For several reasons.
[02:40:10.020 --> 02:40:22.587]  One is to get them to acquiesce to giving up the rest of their rights and to allow the government to finish setting up this totalitarian martial law system here in America.
[02:40:22.607 --> 02:40:29.831]  And we definitely believe that the people, unless we can continue and get the listeners out there to
[02:40:30.495 --> 02:40:35.443]  Just get massive amounts of our publications and tapes and make copies of them.
[02:40:35.523 --> 02:40:36.023]  Get them out.
[02:40:36.424 --> 02:40:38.207]  Start this geometric progression.
[02:40:38.823 --> 02:40:47.585]  The American people are going to beg, actually not beg, we've decided they're going to demand martial law when this terrorism starts again.
[02:40:47.605 --> 02:40:52.926]  Well, that's because they've already put it in the back of their mind that the solution is martial law when it happens.
[02:40:52.946 --> 02:40:53.946]  They say it every day.
[02:40:54.266 --> 02:40:56.307]  Then folks think it's their own idea later.
[02:40:56.327 --> 02:40:58.907]  I mean, that's a classic tactic, Colonel, is it not?
[02:40:59.127 --> 02:41:02.448]  To plant a solution there a few months, a few years before?
[02:41:03.081 --> 02:41:09.686]  Oh yeah, and what they'll do is they'll dream up problems to say, this is what we're starting to look at right now.
[02:41:09.726 --> 02:41:15.129]  We think this might happen, so therefore we're going to pass laws in advance to make sure it doesn't happen for your own protection.
[02:41:15.549 --> 02:41:22.174]  And some of my predictions on this, I think that what we're going to have is reductions in the ability of the American people to travel about.
[02:41:22.874 --> 02:41:25.056]  We're going to be more confined to where we live.
[02:41:25.156 --> 02:41:27.718]  We may end up with internal passports like the Russians had.
[02:41:27.758 --> 02:41:31.200]  We've already been dissuaded from flying at the airports because we're treated like criminals.
[02:41:31.704 --> 02:41:33.465]  We're going to have registration of gun owners.
[02:41:34.465 --> 02:41:44.568]  You know, they say, well, we can't register firearms because of a couple of federal laws, but there's nothing to say they can't issue you a federal permit to buy a gun or to own a gun.
[02:41:44.768 --> 02:41:51.951]  Well, on top of this, showing it's all a fraud, Bush is going to, anybody who can get here will be legalized instantly.
[02:41:52.231 --> 02:42:00.634]  Oh yeah, you know, they're supplying the enemy and they're cutting down on the ability of us to defend ourselves against the enemy, which is basically a recipe for disaster.
[02:42:01.152 --> 02:42:05.333]  They're going to have probably restrictions on the amount of ammo you can buy or even have on your premises.
[02:42:06.833 --> 02:42:10.234]  They'll start controlling food purchases because they'll do it two ways.
[02:42:10.394 --> 02:42:14.055]  One, the amount and rationing due to whatever reason that the emergencies that will come up.
[02:42:14.115 --> 02:42:15.835]  And the other is because it's contaminated.
[02:42:15.895 --> 02:42:18.736]  You know, you've got to have it inspected and so on.
[02:42:19.536 --> 02:42:23.376]  They'll have cross-deputization of agencies more than they do now.
[02:42:23.416 --> 02:42:30.918]  In other words, the local sheriff and his deputies will be cross-deputized with the police from the towns within that county and they'll be cross-deputized
[02:42:31.263 --> 02:42:37.053]  with federal agencies and task forces so that eventually everybody will will come under the umbrella of homeland security
[02:42:37.483 --> 02:42:40.485]  As an anti-terrorist task force, or anti-terrorist organization.
[02:42:40.505 --> 02:42:42.447]  We're seeing this happen more and more every day right now.
[02:42:42.607 --> 02:42:45.469]  Well first they munialize with the MJTF, federally funded.
[02:42:45.709 --> 02:42:48.231]  Then they take that Lego set and plug it into the bigger one.
[02:42:48.511 --> 02:42:52.554]  And since Jack made this prediction of more terror, I agree with that.
[02:42:52.934 --> 02:43:05.423]  William Sapphire, the Neocon Chieftain in the New York Times today said, this is a prediction, the October surprise, I'm reading from him, affecting our election will be the capture of Bin Laden in Yemen,
[02:43:06.098 --> 02:43:11.860]  The daring escape of Saddam, a major terror attack in the U.S., finding a buried bag of anthrax in Tikrit.
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:12.780]  Gentleman comments.
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:19.161]  Well, I think, yeah, that's a real Easter basket full of colored eggs right there.
[02:43:20.462 --> 02:43:23.122]  Yeah, you know, there's no telling what they can crank up.
[02:43:23.223 --> 02:43:24.823]  It's absolutely incredible.
[02:43:25.439 --> 02:43:26.260]  I don't think so.
[02:43:40.791 --> 02:43:45.233]  You know, we're going to put this guy in jail and no one's going to talk to him because we don't want him to say what really happened.
[02:43:45.253 --> 02:43:52.537]  What's scary about Sapphire is last year they said, oh, he's got such a crystal ball, he predicted 9-11 with precision.
[02:43:52.757 --> 02:43:55.018]  Well, yeah, the guy's inside all this.
[02:43:55.478 --> 02:43:56.419]  Well, he's an outlet.
[02:43:57.119 --> 02:43:58.140]  You know, he's a mouthpiece.
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:43:58.980]  I mean, what can you say?
[02:44:01.221 --> 02:44:02.342]  Wow.
[02:44:02.642 --> 02:44:10.246]  We're going to have a total federalization of local police under these same rubrics here and also watch for
[02:44:10.996 --> 02:44:13.937]  The elimination of the election of the county sheriff.
[02:44:13.997 --> 02:44:16.178]  They're working very hard on this right now.
[02:44:16.318 --> 02:44:30.503]  One-third of the sheriffs across the country are now appointed by those more intelligent than the American people under this home rule situation where they're merging the police departments together to save tax dollars.
[02:44:30.543 --> 02:44:32.104]  The people fall for that every time.
[02:44:32.711 --> 02:44:52.059]  But elimination of the voting in of the county sheriff is big on their agenda because in certain areas like our place here and other places, the county sheriff can stop the federal Gestapo from coming into the county or coming into his federal compliance office and look at their paperwork and ask them what they're going to do.
[02:44:52.159 --> 02:44:53.620]  Hey, Craig, do you want to run for sheriff?
[02:44:57.140 --> 02:45:07.944]  Well, you know, they keep telling me I need to do that down here, but the problem is, that's a real job, and I had one once and didn't like it, you know, so... You know, it's one of those, you've got to get up in the morning and be there by 8 o'clock and it's 20 miles away, so I don't know.
[02:45:08.264 --> 02:45:16.006]  They pretty much let me run my little corner of the county down here the way I see fit, because no one comes down here unless they can play a banjo and they're not married to their cousin anyway, you know?
[02:45:16.346 --> 02:45:24.469]  Well, listen, Craig, now don't forget, you know, the government will give you a Apache helicopter and they'll pick you up right there at your home and whip you over those 20 miles
[02:45:25.256 --> 02:45:29.901]  Won't take you any time at all, and you can fly around in that Apache, supervising the people.
[02:45:30.161 --> 02:45:31.663]  You talked me into it, I guess I'll run.
[02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:33.941]  Well, yeah, he flies those.
[02:45:34.882 --> 02:45:38.364]  We got a bunch of callers here, but I want to get a comment from both of you.
[02:45:38.484 --> 02:45:40.905]  Eberhardt, I mean, I cannot make a big enough deal of this.
[02:45:41.406 --> 02:45:51.152]  The head of NORTHCOM says, well, the Pentagon's watching you, we're going to have troops on the streets, and martial law's the next step, and we're going to be involved in your life, and Franks is off saying this.
[02:45:51.692 --> 02:45:55.835]  Your take, gentlemen, on them openly, openly is talking about this now.
[02:45:57.026 --> 02:45:59.249]  Well, they're making it sound good for the people.
[02:45:59.269 --> 02:46:00.750]  The government's here to help you.
[02:46:01.171 --> 02:46:02.713]  And that's what they're talking about.
[02:46:02.753 --> 02:46:08.199]  And the American people are realizing that this is a dangerous world because there's these biologicals.
[02:46:08.319 --> 02:46:09.140]  People are dying.
[02:46:09.220 --> 02:46:10.982]  Mad cows are dying and everything.
[02:46:11.002 --> 02:46:14.066]  And people are getting so scared and so in fear.
[02:46:14.775 --> 02:46:20.719]  That they almost like to hear our representatives telling them how they're going to protect us and take care of us.
[02:46:20.799 --> 02:46:26.662]  And that's the definition of terrorism, is scaring somebody so they'll go along with your political policy, and that's a big question.
[02:46:26.942 --> 02:46:31.385]  Why did they just now announce that Mad Cow's here, when they've known it's been here for over a decade?
[02:46:32.746 --> 02:46:36.708]  Well, I think right now, you know, what they're doing is they're brickpiling.
[02:46:36.728 --> 02:46:41.851]  Now, an intelligence work we call brickpiling, or PSYOPs work you call brickpiling,
[02:46:42.316 --> 02:46:42.536]  I think?
[02:47:04.918 --> 02:47:12.392]  And yeah, we have to give up some rights and we have to have some more restrictions, but it's a different world today than it was in the 1950s or last year or whatever.
[02:47:12.692 --> 02:47:16.720]  And so people are talked into this, and you've got all the talking heads of mainstream media.
[02:47:17.068 --> 02:47:21.152]  Telling us, you know, this is what has to be done.
[02:47:21.232 --> 02:47:23.894]  It's too little, it's maybe too late, but it's the best we can do today.
[02:47:23.914 --> 02:47:27.657]  So it's a bunch of fast-talking carnival hucksters until our head spins.
[02:47:27.737 --> 02:47:29.238]  Jack McClam comments on this.
[02:47:29.459 --> 02:47:32.501]  Well, Craig's got it 100% right there.
[02:47:32.561 --> 02:47:41.088]  It's just a piling on, a piling on to create so much fear and consternation that the people are immobilized by fear.
[02:47:41.288 --> 02:47:45.332]  And they are going to depend 100% on their government coming in to save us.
[02:47:46.094 --> 02:47:47.795]  We've already had a lot of success.
[02:47:47.855 --> 02:47:48.516]  It's just not fast enough.
[02:47:48.536 --> 02:47:49.296]  Let's take calls.
[02:47:49.316 --> 02:47:51.517]  Up first is Rodney in Connecticut.
[02:47:51.537 --> 02:47:52.238]  Rodney, go ahead.
[02:48:15.754 --> 02:48:17.495]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call today.
[02:48:17.515 --> 02:48:19.816]  Can you hear me?
[02:48:19.956 --> 02:48:20.797]  Yes I can, go ahead.
[02:48:25.984 --> 02:48:30.186]  The number of that bill and when do you think it might be implemented?
[02:48:30.426 --> 02:48:38.550]  Okay, well they've got John McCain's bill introduced.
[02:48:38.930 --> 02:48:40.131]  Bush is supporting the bill.
[02:48:40.391 --> 02:48:44.353]  If you get here, you're legalized for three years automatically.
[02:48:44.373 --> 02:48:45.333]  I don't have the bill in front of me.
[02:48:45.373 --> 02:48:46.514]  I covered it two weeks ago.
[02:48:47.354 --> 02:48:49.375]  But that's been big news everywhere.
[02:48:51.176 --> 02:48:53.717]  So has it been brought up
[02:48:54.235 --> 02:49:02.242]  Well, you know, they did this once before.
[02:49:02.522 --> 02:49:07.186]  It wasn't that, what, two or three years ago they had that mass deal under the Clintons.
[02:49:13.450 --> 02:49:15.552]  That if you're here, you're good to go.
[02:49:15.672 --> 02:49:17.294]  But this is complete and unlimited.
[02:49:17.334 --> 02:49:18.956]  If you ever get here, you're good to go.
[02:49:19.876 --> 02:49:23.760]  And that's the same reason they haven't sealed off the southern border.
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:26.683]  That's the same reason that they allow anybody to get into this country.
[02:49:26.703 --> 02:49:31.268]  I mean, here we're supposed to be fighting terror sneaking into the country, and yet we keep the doors open and our eyes closed.
[02:49:31.696 --> 02:49:32.257]  It's ludicrous.
[02:49:32.297 --> 02:49:33.277]  It's because they want disaster.
[02:49:33.297 --> 02:49:35.859]  But we've got helicopters flying around aiming machine guns at people.
[02:49:36.180 --> 02:49:40.583]  Yeah, they want a disaster to occur so that they can step in with UN forces.
[02:49:40.663 --> 02:49:41.784]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[02:49:41.824 --> 02:49:45.086]  We talked about this ten years ago and everybody laughed and said, that could never happen here.
[02:49:45.407 --> 02:49:51.131]  We did army exercises on it five years ago, that this is what we would do if we didn't have enough troops to defend.
[02:49:51.331 --> 02:49:56.075]  And now they've announced, if our troops are tied down in the war on terror, we'll use, quote, foreign assets.
[02:49:56.175 --> 02:49:58.116]  That's what General Barry McCaffrey told
[02:49:59.481 --> 02:50:04.482]  The Cascade Class 11 worked that about four years ago, and they have done it.
[02:50:04.562 --> 02:50:12.484]  They've already brought in foreign troops and used them in the skies over America right after 9-11, and even had them ready to come in on the ground if they needed them.
[02:50:12.804 --> 02:50:13.964]  Yeah, thanks Rodney.
[02:50:14.084 --> 02:50:15.544]  One more thing, Alex.
[02:50:16.025 --> 02:50:23.426]  If they do do that, is that going to mean people can fly in on the airlines and not have to be checked?
[02:50:24.686 --> 02:50:27.807]  Basically, according to the Miami Herald, they have a thing called acing.
[02:50:28.419 --> 02:50:32.262]  And when you come in from a third world country, you just hold your papers up and walk by.
[02:50:33.263 --> 02:50:35.305]  See, this is all about training you to be a slave.
[02:50:35.345 --> 02:50:36.265]  So yes, thanks for the call.
[02:50:36.285 --> 02:50:36.786]  Thank you very much.
[02:50:36.806 --> 02:50:50.517]  We're going to come back and jam Chris, Ian, and Marcello in real quick with our two guests who I've been so honored to have with us here in the final show of 2003.
[02:50:52.238 --> 02:50:54.220]  Final segment, stay the course, stay with us.
[02:50:57.566 --> 02:51:00.474]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:51:01.158 --> 02:51:02.439]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:51:18.549 --> 02:51:22.351]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:51:22.591 --> 02:51:27.234]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:51:27.314 --> 02:51:30.036]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:51:30.376 --> 02:51:33.538]  Psychotic UN Population Control Plans and much, much more.

[02:51:53.652 --> 02:51:55.713]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:51:57.796 --> 02:52:02.299]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:06.723]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:52:07.023 --> 02:52:07.583]  We listened.
[02:52:07.883 --> 02:52:12.887]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:52:13.147 --> 02:52:13.628]  We listened.
[02:52:14.028 --> 02:52:17.070]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:52:17.471 --> 02:52:17.991]  We listened.
[02:52:18.467 --> 02:52:22.528]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:52:22.908 --> 02:52:23.389]  We listened.
[02:52:23.749 --> 02:52:28.970]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:52:29.390 --> 02:52:30.751]  Again, we listened.
[02:52:31.111 --> 02:52:38.493]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:52:38.873 --> 02:52:41.914]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259

[02:54:05.154 --> 02:54:08.675]  We have covered so much in the last two hours and 54 minutes.
[02:54:10.235 --> 02:54:14.437]  And it's always great to have Colonel Roberts and Jack McClam on the show.
[02:54:14.717 --> 02:54:18.158]  And God bless you both, gentlemen, for your fine work.
[02:54:18.178 --> 02:54:20.758]  Let's cram a few more calls in here quickly.
[02:54:21.479 --> 02:54:23.139]  Chris in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[02:54:23.179 --> 02:54:23.659]  Go ahead.
[02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:26.700]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:54:28.523 --> 02:54:29.343]  Yes, am I on the air now?
[02:54:29.623 --> 02:54:30.324]  You sure are.
[02:54:30.444 --> 02:54:31.664]  Okay, thank you very much.
[02:54:31.984 --> 02:54:40.027]  Well tonight, you know, it's going to be all this securities coming out here tonight about just roadblocks and all this and also looking for suspicious activity.
[02:54:40.627 --> 02:54:46.609]  I am so sick and tired of these mainstream news conditioning everybody out here, saying how good this is.
[02:54:46.889 --> 02:54:48.930]  So I guess Hitler was evil, that's bad.
[02:54:49.170 --> 02:54:53.671]  But the torture they want to do to us, search our vehicles without a fourth amendment, do that kind of style is good here.
[02:54:53.691 --> 02:54:55.892]  I mean, it's just getting so out of hand out here.
[02:54:56.397 --> 02:54:58.079]  I've been reaching a lot of people out here.
[02:54:58.320 --> 02:55:00.402]  You do have some listeners, the people I've talked to.
[02:55:00.422 --> 02:55:15.321]  I hope you, Kentucky listeners out there, get active and keep going with this because since 9-11, I have seen such behavioral problems with the police, not that they're bad, but I have seen people get searched for no reason in public parks, harassed,
[02:55:16.257 --> 02:55:19.459]  Anything that looks like you're a terrorist or you're with Al Qaeda.
[02:55:19.559 --> 02:55:20.439]  Chris, great points.
[02:55:20.479 --> 02:55:21.140]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:21.180 --> 02:55:33.165]  There's a new thing about world almanacs, farmers' almanacs, maps in your car, and the feds in the article yesterday said, yeah, well, we're doing this to give police an excuse to search people and take them in.
[02:55:33.185 --> 02:55:37.067]  I mean, they're now admitting while they're doing it, Craig and Jack.
[02:55:37.267 --> 02:55:37.587]  Yeah.
[02:55:38.828 --> 02:55:39.728]  Oh, it's incredible.
[02:55:39.748 --> 02:55:41.509]  You know, I mean, what is terrorist material?
[02:55:41.589 --> 02:55:42.750]  It's anything they say it is now.
[02:55:43.399 --> 02:55:47.363]  I mean, a can of beans can be terrorist material because you might hit somebody in the head with it, you know?
[02:55:48.404 --> 02:55:50.105]  And what is a terrorist, Craig?
[02:55:50.405 --> 02:55:53.228]  They're saying anybody they say is a terrorist, too, right?
[02:55:53.508 --> 02:55:54.129]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:55:54.169 --> 02:55:57.972]  See, what they've done is they've created a brandy and iron that one size fits all.
[02:55:58.172 --> 02:56:00.875]  Well, did you hear they're going after Limbaugh with the Patriot Act?
[02:56:04.027 --> 02:56:10.938]  Sometimes people will wake up when they do such ridiculously stupid things as that that's so outrageously asinine.
[02:56:10.978 --> 02:56:14.504]  It's like going to the carnival and watching all the clowns get out of the car, you know?
[02:56:16.943 --> 02:56:21.046]  I mean, how far can you go before you step on your own foot and shoot yourself in the toe?
[02:56:21.367 --> 02:56:24.229]  Jack, you got a comment about the evil almanacs?
[02:56:24.729 --> 02:56:27.011]  Well, it's just more of the same.
[02:56:27.351 --> 02:56:30.894]  Total control of the population, and the people love it so.
[02:56:31.194 --> 02:56:37.639]  You know, the people are just digging it because our good Christian president is protecting us from all these evils.
[02:56:38.123 --> 02:56:47.331]  I wanted to say, too, that Captain Darryl Eberhardt wrote to us and talked about, we put his article in our latest Ain't About Police Military newsletter on the coming national draft.
[02:56:48.131 --> 02:56:55.057]  And I believe that this could very well happen in the next year, because Bush didn't expect to be bogged down in Iraq.
[02:56:55.398 --> 02:57:05.426]  He thought he'd be on to crush Iran and Syria next, and take over the oil and so forth, and those nations.
[02:57:06.047 --> 02:57:18.874]  And now he's bogged down and the world won't come to help him because they don't want to get their men and women shot up in this war for oil and taking over these natural resources because the Bush crime family probably won't share it.
[02:57:19.434 --> 02:57:27.178]  So Captain Darryl Eberhardt makes the good case that we will probably see a national draft and it could be a universal draft.
[02:57:27.238 --> 02:57:28.699]  Ron Paul said that last week.
[02:57:28.839 --> 02:57:30.239]  One final caller of the year.
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:32.681]  Let's talk to Ian in Canada.
[02:57:32.701 --> 02:57:33.361]  Real quick Ian.
[02:57:35.092 --> 02:57:35.993]  Oh, Alex, what an honor.
[02:57:36.053 --> 02:57:42.258]  Do you think that the media announced mad cow disease more than three decades ago?
[02:57:42.779 --> 02:57:53.808]  And by that I mean that Michael Crichton, who started as a research doctor in microbiology, wrote a book over 30 years ago called The Andromeda Strain, and it was quickly made into a movie.
[02:57:53.888 --> 02:57:56.950]  He still provides ideas to Hollywood, script ideas.
[02:57:57.771 --> 02:58:02.215]  In that book, The Andromeda Strain, he posited
[02:58:02.808 --> 02:58:12.223]  A crystalline microbe, albeit fictional, that came from an extraterrestrial source, that infected victims on Earth and drove them mad.
[02:58:12.662 --> 02:58:16.405]  Isn't that precisely the same configuration and characteristic of the Preon?
[02:58:17.165 --> 02:58:19.687]  It's amazing, and Crichton's one of their chief thinkers.
[02:58:19.947 --> 02:58:23.310]  Final words, Greg Roberts, Jack McClam, real quick.
[02:58:23.510 --> 02:58:28.514]  RifleWarrior.com, they've got four or five good articles there on the Mad Cow, go over there and check it out.
[02:58:28.594 --> 02:58:29.594]  RifleWarrior.com.
[02:58:29.634 --> 02:58:31.736]  Alright, thank you sir, have a good New Year.
[02:58:32.076 --> 02:58:33.317]  Greg Roberts, final comments.
[02:58:33.617 --> 02:58:34.558]  I mean, Jack McClam.
[02:58:36.536 --> 02:58:37.919]  Be strong and courageous.
[02:58:38.019 --> 02:58:41.405]  Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the Lord is always with you.
[02:58:41.565 --> 02:58:44.170]  Go to police and military against the New World Order.
[02:58:44.371 --> 02:58:45.152]  We're out of time!
[02:58:45.212 --> 02:58:45.994]  See you next year!
[02:58:46.934 --> 02:58:50.416]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:58:50.677 --> 02:58:54.179]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:58:54.279 --> 02:58:58.202]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:58:58.442 --> 02:59:04.586]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:59:05.006 --> 02:59:12.912]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:59:13.332 --> 02:59:14.113]  Thanks for watching!
