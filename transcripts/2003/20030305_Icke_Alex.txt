[00:00:05.646 --> 00:00:06.948]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.948 --> 00:00:08.729]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:10.511]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.072]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:13.634]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:17.818]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:20.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.981]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:23.923]  That's right.
[00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:27.445]  The last thing on the growing list of wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:28.626]  Simulcasting at nforwars.com and net.
[00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:32.690]  And via global shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 central at 12.172 and 9320 global shortwave.
[00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.911]  Midnight, 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 6890.
[00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:35.071]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.893]  Thank you for joining us here in the second hour.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:01:06.913]  Torture, chemical weapons to be used in Iraq, re-education centers for women and children, women and children to be killed if they try to flee MSNBC, and the sickening brainwashed population is being turned into what their masters are.
[00:01:06.913 --> 00:01:09.896]  A mirror image of demonic creatures.
[00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:18.411]  This is the warping of society, turning evil into good, and good into evil, black into white, white into black.
[00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.992]  This is the mass mind control.
[00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:32.516]  But there is an awakening taking place globally, across political lines, across national lines, to the New World Order, and just how evil these people are.
[00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:35.337]  They are the masters of engineering societies.
[00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:40.239]  Well, the next two hours we're joined by David Icke.
[00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:48.224]  He is a best-selling author, former BBC reporter, famous soccer player.
[00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:54.720]  And about 98% of what he has to say is totally documented, up one side and down the other.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:06.263]  2% I have a problem with, but we're honored to have him on the show, joining us from the United Kingdom, and this should be a very eventful broadcast.
[00:02:06.263 --> 00:02:11.344]  David, thanks for taking time out to join us on the show, sir.
[00:02:11.344 --> 00:02:16.845]  You see, which is now known as the Blair Broadcasting Corporation, because of its support for him over the years.
[00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.991]  Unfortunately for him, he's having a real problem here now.
[00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:28.076]  Persuading the British people that they should go and kill innocent people, which is a real good sign that awakening's underway.
[00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:30.118]  David, we didn't have you faded up right there at the start.
[00:02:30.118 --> 00:02:32.800]  Can you start over what you were saying about Blair and BBC?
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.783]  I just said that the BBC is known in Britain now as the Blair Broadcasting Corporation.
[00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:41.409]  Because it's been pretty much a propaganda tool for him for some time.
[00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:52.296]  He's got a Labour supporter as Director General, he's got a Labour supporter and funder as Chairman, and it's just been taking the government line for a long time now.
[00:02:52.296 --> 00:02:57.019]  His job is to bring England into the Euro and destroy sovereignty, correct?
[00:02:58.232 --> 00:02:58.953]  Absolutely right.
[00:02:58.953 --> 00:03:07.419]  I mean, I wrote in a book some years ago that one of the things that Blair was being brought into was to bring us into the Euro.
[00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:17.345]  Because, I mean, as you've talked about, and many people that have researched this have talked about, the agenda for the global fascist state includes a global currency.
[00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:26.392]  And of course, if you go from where we are now to a single currency in one leap, then people look up and say, hold on, what's going on here?
[00:03:27.268 --> 00:03:27.929]  We're good to go.
[00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:49.318]  We've been very adverse to accepting it and so other European countries, France, Germany and the Netherlands have gone into it first.
[00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:57.802]  But Blair's job is to bring the British people into it and he will do it in the way that we were stuck in the European Union to start with.
[00:03:57.802 --> 00:04:09.107]  They have what they call a democratic vote, a national referendum, but what they do is put millions and millions of pounds behind the do what we want camp
[00:04:10.047 --> 00:04:19.096]  And the others have to scratch around and get funded wherever they can with donations, and it's a completely unequal debate, and that's what they're planning for the Euro.
[00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:32.149]  Well, David Icke, of course, in much of Europe, people were not allowed to vote on it, and I want to go over your unique, and you are very well researched and truly insightful on the subject of the New World Order, I want to go over
[00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:33.495]  No, I'm good.
[00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:54.969]  And then any other sectors of this discussion, you can lead us where you'd like to go.
[00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.730]  Deb will open the phones up for callers later in this hour.
[00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.370]  Stay with us, David.
[00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.030]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.132]  This is Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:04.132 --> 00:05:08.933]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:11.074]  Alright, it's eight minutes into the hour.
[00:05:11.074 --> 00:05:13.475]  We've got David Icke.
[00:05:15.054 --> 00:05:26.678]  Next part on the New World Order, very insightful author, former BBC broadcaster, professional soccer player, you would say football player.
[00:05:26.678 --> 00:05:33.761]  Joining us, and I agree with about 98% of what David has to say, again the word is insightful.
[00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:47.302]  The word is, tying it together, great analysis, and we're going to talk about the history of the New World Order, what their total plan is, what life will be like under this Matrix-like system if we don't defeat it.
[00:05:47.302 --> 00:05:54.827]  And I also want to get into Bohemian Grove and the satanic nature of the New World Order, because I didn't believe this just five years ago.
[00:05:54.827 --> 00:05:58.949]  I had to go investigate it myself with my own eyeballs.
[00:05:58.949 --> 00:05:59.950]  It is true
[00:06:01.002 --> 00:06:04.026]  But they're predators, and it's the religion of predators.
[00:06:04.026 --> 00:06:10.472]  David, where would you like to begin your presentation with this listenership?
[00:06:10.472 --> 00:06:15.438]  Well, Alex, I think I can bring in what you've just been talking about quite early on here.
[00:06:15.438 --> 00:06:19.502]  If I just give a brief summary of where I went with this.
[00:06:19.502 --> 00:06:23.006]  First of all, when I was a journalist, and for a short time,
[00:06:23.857 --> 00:06:28.999]  I was actually a national spokesman for the British Green Party back in the 80s, which was very important for me.
[00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:35.361]  I didn't stay long because once I saw politics as it worked on the inside, you know, I was throwing up symbolically.
[00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:36.621]  I just wanted to get out.
[00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:49.846]  But what it did was show me what an irrelevance politics is and how, and this was really what got me thinking, is how people who were hurling abuse at each other in public debate and on television,
[00:06:50.612 --> 00:06:54.234]  We're actually anything but like that behind the scenes.
[00:06:54.234 --> 00:07:05.699]  And I started to realize that there was a there were connections between apparently unconnected indeed even antagonistic people in politics that I really hadn't seen before.
[00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:16.924]  And what happened is I started to research the nature of the way the world is manipulated today much of along the lines of what appears on your website and on this show.
[00:07:16.924 --> 00:07:18.565]  And I started to realize the
[00:07:19.512 --> 00:07:29.066]  The structure through which a few could control the world through structures that can be symbolized as pyramids, compartmentalized pyramids where the vast majority of people
[00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:41.533]  Who are working in the banking system or the political system, what have you, and in the military and the media are actually compartmentalized from the knowledge of what those organizations are really being used for.
[00:07:41.533 --> 00:07:46.076]  It's what intelligence agencies and stuff like that call the need to know.
[00:07:46.076 --> 00:07:50.158]  They only know enough to do their job and make their contribution.
[00:07:51.078 --> 00:08:07.444]  Only the few at the top of the pyramid, at the capstone, really know how all these apparently innocent contributions lower down the pyramid fit together to create anything but an innocent picture and an innocent pattern in the way that the world is going.
[00:08:08.604 --> 00:08:27.516]  If I could jump in, in one of your videos, a very revealing comment you made was about visiting Europe, a Bilderberg Group meeting, and you come face-to-face on that road with that police officer, a nice man, guarding the people that literally would like to suck the blood right out of the veins of his children.
[00:08:27.516 --> 00:08:28.637]  Can you describe that story?
[00:08:29.037 --> 00:08:52.509]  Yeah, what happened was that, as coincidence would have it, someone invited me, a friend, to have a week's holiday with my family in southern Switzerland, and just around the time that that happened, or just after, I got a round-robin letter from what was then known as the Spotlight newspaper, saying that this is where the Bilderberg meeting is this year, and it was
[00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:58.783]  In Switzerland, and anyone in that area is invited to come along.
[00:08:58.783 --> 00:09:01.085]  So, of course, I went along.
[00:09:01.085 --> 00:09:09.853]  I went along about two days before it started, and it was the top of this mountain, three hotels all owned by the same people.
[00:09:09.853 --> 00:09:13.135]  It was clear that something was happening already.
[00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:18.840]  There were people with badges on, and there were security people, and there were fences going up.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.562]  And I had a sniff around and then left, and then I came back.
[00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:34.196]  On the last day of the I think it was a five-day meeting that year and suddenly I met a roadblock literally as you turned onto the road to go towards the mountain.
[00:09:34.196 --> 00:09:34.637]  This is a
[00:09:35.564 --> 00:09:39.808]  A very long distance from where the hotels and the meeting were actually taking place.
[00:09:39.808 --> 00:09:45.053]  And there was this guy on the roadblock in this massive orange coat with Swiss police on the back.
[00:09:45.053 --> 00:09:46.835]  And I just talked to him.
[00:09:46.835 --> 00:09:48.677]  Nice man, like you say.
[00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:49.718]  What's going on up here?
[00:09:49.718 --> 00:09:50.619]  Why can't I go?
[00:09:50.619 --> 00:09:52.080]  Playing the ignorant.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.662]  And he hadn't got a clue.
[00:09:54.568 --> 00:10:07.416]  He just said that there is an event going on, there's a meeting going on here, and people are not allowed to go on the mountain until it's over, and he was told that it would be breaking up towards the end of that afternoon.
[00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:08.616]  He hadn't got a clue.
[00:10:08.616 --> 00:10:12.018]  And this is, as you rightly point out, this is how the pyramid works.
[00:10:13.819 --> 00:10:27.670]  The vast majority of people who are playing their part, pushing the world towards this global centralized fascist state, have either no idea they're doing so, or no idea of the consequences of doing so.
[00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:37.778]  And this is how a few, because at the real peak, compared with the global population, as you know, it's a very few, can actually manipulate the masses to imprison themselves.
[00:10:44.417 --> 00:10:52.223]  That's what the war on terror is all about.
[00:10:52.223 --> 00:11:02.391]  The globalists create the fear, and then we imprison ourselves, and it gets us behind their system, adding incredible power, turning the puny globalists into a juggernaut.
[00:11:03.155 --> 00:11:03.935]  Exactly.
[00:11:03.935 --> 00:11:14.319]  And when I kind of started to realize all this, because I'm kind of one of these kind of illogical people, I like to see the structure in which something works, and then I can start to pin things on it and add more detail to it.
[00:11:14.319 --> 00:11:28.743]  But once I realized that's how they did it, and I saw how they were controlling the institutions of society, all the major institutions that control society, the media, the finances, the politics, etc.
[00:11:28.743 --> 00:11:31.164]  I asked a simple question, which was starting to take us
[00:11:33.483 --> 00:11:41.310]  It was clear to anyone with a brain cell that this was not something that could be put together in a few years, or even 50 years.
[00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:48.116]  This force that was manipulating and created this structure had to go back a very long time.
[00:11:48.116 --> 00:12:00.326]  And you don't have to go back very far to realize that these institutions of the free society have not actually been infiltrated by this force, this Illuminati, they were actually structured
[00:12:01.327 --> 00:12:01.767]  I think so.
[00:12:17.254 --> 00:12:18.975]  Motivate them to try to get out of it.
[00:12:18.975 --> 00:12:21.497]  David, let me throw a small example of this in.
[00:12:21.497 --> 00:12:24.359]  I've read some of the published policy reports, the few that are out there.
[00:12:24.359 --> 00:12:31.183]  A hundred years ago, the British Empire was getting a lot of heat because their flag was flying over all these capitals.
[00:12:31.183 --> 00:12:42.491]  But after World War II, they shifted their policy with the round table grips to taking their flag down, putting a dictator in, a strong man, or a group of plutocrats that looked
[00:12:42.891 --> 00:12:44.092]  Exactly how they did it.
[00:12:44.092 --> 00:12:46.494]  It's what I call the prison without the bars.
[00:12:46.494 --> 00:12:54.961]  You give people the illusion that they're free and it is an illusion to the point where it's designated as a free country if people have the right to
[00:13:11.313 --> 00:13:20.383]  Put a cross or whatever next to a name every four or five years, and between the crosses, lose complete control of what those people do in the name of the people who voted them in.
[00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.906]  Or in the case of George Bush, it doesn't even go that far anymore.
[00:13:22.906 --> 00:13:24.207]  You know, they put him in whatever.
[00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:39.263]  The prison without the bars, where people think they're free, that is the ultimate prison, Alex, as we know, because people will sit in that prison indefinitely because they don't think there's a prison to get out of.
[00:13:39.263 --> 00:13:50.394]  It's the ultimate illusion of being in a prison while thinking you're free, and that's exactly the way they have evolved the original in-your-face dictatorships to create this
[00:13:51.318 --> 00:13:51.899]  We're good to go.
[00:14:11.687 --> 00:14:14.068]  Eventually I'm thousands of years B.C.
[00:14:14.068 --> 00:14:25.434]  before I'm picking up, back in Babylon and what have you, before I'm picking up any kind of point where you can say, hey, this is not a starting point, but it's a place you can pick it up.
[00:14:25.434 --> 00:14:31.557]  And then David, then I go to Bohemian Grove and they're calling it the Owl of Babylon of Goodly Tire.
[00:14:32.217 --> 00:14:35.780]  They are always staking their history on that.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.301]  That's their symbol.
[00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:38.782]  Their symbol is Egypt.
[00:14:38.782 --> 00:14:43.666]  The pyramid, the all-seeing eye, it's all around us.
[00:14:43.666 --> 00:14:46.888]  And this really is, I guess, the science of controlling populations.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:54.967]  Yeah, and I can tie together the Bohemian Grove and what we've been talking about in this way.
[00:14:54.967 --> 00:14:57.789]  I have a completely open mind.
[00:14:57.789 --> 00:14:59.771]  I let information be my guide.
[00:14:59.771 --> 00:15:01.292]  I don't have a belief system to defend.
[00:15:01.292 --> 00:15:10.601]  I'm just interested in what's going on and communicating that information so people have an alternative reality to the one that's constantly pounding their mind through the
[00:15:11.341 --> 00:15:12.802]  Mainstream media.
[00:15:12.802 --> 00:15:15.845]  And a number of things started to become clear.
[00:15:15.845 --> 00:15:21.470]  First of all, the kind of rituals, as you rightly point out, that are being done by the elite of today.
[00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:29.156]  I mean, the famous people that are telling us, out of compassion and humanity, we must go and bomb innocent people in Iraq.
[00:15:29.156 --> 00:15:35.481]  They're doing the same kind of rituals as your secret filming of Bohemian Grove confirmed.
[00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:38.964]  These people were doing back in Babylon.
[00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:44.634]  And indeed are doing all over the world today and long time past.
[00:15:44.634 --> 00:15:53.660]  The idea that human sacrifice is some kind of aberration of history when we weren't kind of civilized like we are now, I'm sorry, that is an illusion.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.403]  It's still going on and it's still going on on a scale that staggered me.
[00:15:57.403 --> 00:16:00.205]  It wasn't it was going on, Alex, that really took me aback.
[00:16:00.205 --> 00:16:03.168]  It was the scale of it that I started to uncover.
[00:16:03.168 --> 00:16:06.230]  So here we have the elite of today,
[00:16:07.176 --> 00:16:07.896]  We're good to go.
[00:16:31.753 --> 00:16:37.616]  These Illuminati families are obsessively interbreeding with each other, and always have.
[00:16:37.616 --> 00:16:40.417]  Now, when... We've got a break, David.
[00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:41.057]  We've got a break.
[00:16:41.057 --> 00:16:44.939]  We'll be right back with David Icke.
[00:16:44.939 --> 00:16:55.623]  How many of you knew that Reuters had reported that the entire Bush family, on both sides, is related to the Saxe-Coburts, the German roll family of England?
[00:16:55.623 --> 00:16:56.904]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:16:59.656 --> 00:17:06.460]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk Archives, and we are listener-supported with the Honors System.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.100]  We ask that you wait.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.981]  Don't donate a dollar at a time.
[00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:15.564]  PayPal charges a 35-cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[00:17:15.564 --> 00:17:19.086]  Wait till you listen to five or ten, and then donate, please.
[00:17:19.086 --> 00:17:21.387]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:24.317]  Don't worry.
[00:17:24.317 --> 00:17:26.358]  This show is documented.
[00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:32.399]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17:32.399 --> 00:17:40.902]  A little bit later in the shower, I'll ask David Icke about Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin.
[00:17:40.902 --> 00:17:44.222]  I believe David Icke's analysis about Benjamin Franklin.
[00:17:44.222 --> 00:17:45.563]  We know he was a British agent.
[00:17:45.563 --> 00:17:46.583]  We know he died in England.
[00:17:47.529 --> 00:17:51.946]  You know, they dug some interesting things out of the bottom of his house a few years ago that got little or no attention.
[00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.511]  It wasn't a few of the major British papers.
[00:17:54.891 --> 00:17:58.053]  But the Thomas Jefferson thing, I'm not sure about that.
[00:17:58.053 --> 00:17:59.974]  That's one of the points that I want to bring up.
[00:17:59.974 --> 00:18:06.997]  But David, you were continuing with these bloodlines of the Illuminati, which are clearly there.
[00:18:06.997 --> 00:18:17.602]  And you have the world's royalty admittedly saying that the head of the world's royalty is England, whether it's the Japanese or the Arabs or the Dutch.
[00:18:17.602 --> 00:18:19.583]  They're all connected.
[00:18:19.583 --> 00:18:21.424]  And please continue.
[00:18:22.176 --> 00:18:41.945]  Well, if you go back to Babylon and that ancient era, you had bloodlines put into positions of royal ruling power, and who claimed the right to rule because of their descendants from the gods, or God, the divine right to rule.
[00:18:41.945 --> 00:18:47.107]  And I started to wonder, hold on, what is this divine right to rule, which I'll come to in a second.
[00:18:47.107 --> 00:18:51.509]  So, as you follow the bloodlines of the ruling royal elite of that
[00:18:52.385 --> 00:18:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:32.677]  What happened, and again this comes up to what we talked about earlier, the movement from the EU-faced dictatorship, colonial rule in this case from Britain, and the British Empire, to a
[00:19:34.915 --> 00:19:39.096]  An apparently free country, but it's still controlled covertly.
[00:19:39.096 --> 00:19:51.399]  There was a movement which appeared on the surface to be these empires pulling back from their control of these countries, colonial rule, and giving, quote, independence to these former colonies.
[00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:55.980]  What happened, in fact, is that only happened on the surface.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:07.553]  What was left behind in these countries were the bloodline and the secret society network through which this bloodline manipulates itself into power.
[00:20:07.553 --> 00:20:12.319]  And those bloodlines and those secret society networks have gone on manipulating these
[00:20:12.899 --> 00:20:17.200]  Apparently free countries ever since, like the United States and others around the world.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:36.905]  David, I want to go back to something, and then we'll get back into the line you're on here, because when you started the show, you brought up how you got involved in politics, you were a BBC broadcaster, you know, famous soccer player, and you're getting involved, and you find out that the equivalent of your Republicans and Democrats, you know, Labor and the Tories, are fighting with each other out in the open,
[00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:42.560]  It's Shakespearean theater, but behind the scenes, they're voting the same.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.680]  They're going along with each other.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.482]  They're all buddies playing golf.
[00:20:45.482 --> 00:20:47.283]  It's the same thing here.
[00:20:47.283 --> 00:20:50.706]  Bush is gun-grabbing, open borders, signing onto U.N.
[00:20:50.706 --> 00:20:54.509]  deals, biggest government ever, destroying sovereignty.
[00:20:54.509 --> 00:21:02.334]  You try to tell the average conservative that he's a good person, they will try to deny it when faced with it, they go, well, at least he's not Bill Clinton.
[00:21:02.334 --> 00:21:05.297]  So it's form over substance.
[00:21:06.714 --> 00:21:21.222]  What you find when you study this is that they will debate and argue over things that are not absolutely relevant to the movement, the incessant movement to the global fascist state.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.222]  In other words, the constant centralization of power.
[00:21:25.222 --> 00:21:29.624]  Sovereign nations giving more and more power away to global institutions.
[00:21:29.624 --> 00:21:32.845]  They'll talk about what judge is going to get appointed for 10,000 hours.
[00:21:32.845 --> 00:21:33.945]  Exactly.
[00:21:33.945 --> 00:21:46.091]  But when you study it, when the key votes come on key elements to advance this new world order, centralized global state, they vote together.
[00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:53.455]  And so we have the illusion, because fundamental to the illusion of being free,
[00:21:54.312 --> 00:22:02.099]  While not being so, is to give the illusion that there is free debate going on and people actually have a choice.
[00:22:02.099 --> 00:22:09.845]  One of the great things, Alex, that is happening now, certainly in this country, is people are starting to see this.
[00:22:09.845 --> 00:22:15.650]  Again and again you hear this line, it doesn't matter who you vote for, nothing ever changes.
[00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:20.414]  And one of the ways that this works, and it's so obvious in Britain, and I'm sure it is in America,
[00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:21.329]  I think?
[00:22:37.134 --> 00:22:43.458]  Therefore, it can oppose and question and all that stuff, because it has no power to do anything.
[00:22:43.458 --> 00:22:48.021]  Only the governmental party does, and therefore it introduces the agenda.
[00:22:48.021 --> 00:22:53.244]  Then we have this farce called an election, and often they change places.
[00:22:53.244 --> 00:22:54.025]  Stay there, David.
[00:22:54.025 --> 00:22:54.865]  We've got a break again.
[00:22:54.865 --> 00:22:55.726]  Long segment coming up.
[00:22:55.726 --> 00:23:01.029]  Plenty of time to develop this, and I've got some examples of what David's talking about that I'll give you here in just a minute.
[00:23:01.641 --> 00:23:03.562]  And then later we're going to open the phones up.
[00:23:03.562 --> 00:23:06.062]  We've got him for a whole other hour and a half.
[00:23:06.062 --> 00:23:10.524]  David Icke, I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:23:10.524 --> 00:23:11.904]  We're on the march.
[00:23:11.904 --> 00:23:14.445]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:23:14.445 --> 00:23:17.126]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23:21.883 --> 00:23:46.965]  Join Alex live on the air toll-free at 1-800-259-9231 or email the InfoWarrior at Alex at InfoWars.com Alright, we got callers from Missouri to Minnesota to Delaware and they're coming up before this hour ends and then into the next hour but
[00:23:47.679 --> 00:23:57.683]  I want to give David plenty of time to talk, and then later before the show ends, I've got a few questions, points of criticism.
[00:23:57.683 --> 00:24:00.264]  You can probably answer them.
[00:24:00.264 --> 00:24:03.965]  Overall, I think David's doing a lot of really good work.
[00:24:03.965 --> 00:24:09.227]  He uses this example of the farce of an election or the phony debate.
[00:24:09.227 --> 00:24:11.788]  Let me give you an example of the left and right in America.
[00:24:13.078 --> 00:24:16.620]  About three years ago, I saw what the current script was.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.402]  Right down to using Iraqis to blow stuff up.
[00:24:19.402 --> 00:24:21.984]  Connecting them to the American right wing.
[00:24:21.984 --> 00:24:27.207]  One group, the Patriots, is really fighting them here, head on.
[00:24:27.207 --> 00:24:29.308]  And I laid that out, now you see it being scripted.
[00:24:29.308 --> 00:24:34.391]  And I laid out, it's painful how obvious all this has gotten now that we put so many pieces in.
[00:24:34.391 --> 00:24:36.893]  Now we're just to the final few pieces and it's clear where they go.
[00:24:38.169 --> 00:24:41.694]  That they would try to push an agenda for a world government.
[00:24:41.694 --> 00:24:48.844]  That they'd deny this world government was forming until it had basically gotten so big they couldn't deny it anymore, the elephant in the living room.
[00:24:48.844 --> 00:24:52.308]  So they said, okay, the question is, what type of new world order will it be?
[00:24:52.308 --> 00:24:55.773]  I think that's where David Icke was going with this, was that
[00:24:56.471 --> 00:25:07.719]  They'll have one party who is for this agenda publicly, and then the other that's supposedly opposition, but they won't criticize the bulk of it or any real substance.
[00:25:07.719 --> 00:25:17.485]  They will debate some tertiary little side issue, and then people automatically have the debate framed and limited in their minds.
[00:25:17.485 --> 00:25:21.648]  To use a simpler example, you got three shells in a shell game.
[00:25:22.245 --> 00:25:24.527]  And one of them has a cyanide pill under it.
[00:25:24.527 --> 00:25:27.529]  You're going to have to eat it if you pick up the wrong one.
[00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:32.093]  Well, the globalists just have a cyanide pill, say, in England with five or six parties.
[00:25:32.093 --> 00:25:33.895]  They've got five or six different shells.
[00:25:33.895 --> 00:25:38.438]  Every shell, every walnut shell, has a cyanide pill under it.
[00:25:38.438 --> 00:25:40.320]  So, it's a win-win for them.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.142]  They select the candidates.
[00:25:43.142 --> 00:25:47.586]  They, with the media power, present them to you, and then they have a phony debate.
[00:25:47.586 --> 00:25:48.907]  Is that what you were getting at, David?
[00:25:52.677 --> 00:25:54.358]  David Icke?
[00:25:54.358 --> 00:25:58.561]  Do we have David Backmark?
[00:25:58.561 --> 00:25:59.362]  Are we there?
[00:25:59.362 --> 00:26:00.022]  Ah, yes.
[00:26:00.022 --> 00:26:01.043]  Ah, great.
[00:26:01.043 --> 00:26:01.984]  Fantastic.
[00:26:01.984 --> 00:26:09.890]  Yeah, as I was saying, the party in government has the power to introduce the agenda, the party in opposition does not.
[00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:16.975]  And sometimes you'll have opposition parties criticizing elements of the agenda that the governing party is bringing in.
[00:26:17.575 --> 00:26:32.783]  But then after a farce of an election, and every so often the two parties change sides, and one becomes the government, the government becomes the opposition, suddenly the opposition party as was, that was saying we shouldn't have this, we shouldn't have that, then start introducing it.
[00:26:32.783 --> 00:26:38.226]  And there's no better example I've ever come across than Blair's Labour Party.
[00:26:38.226 --> 00:26:42.649]  Virtually every element of what Blair's Labour Party has introduced
[00:26:43.409 --> 00:26:50.974]  Since he was first elected, which has advanced the agenda, he and his party opposed in opposition.
[00:26:50.974 --> 00:27:01.661]  And this is the way the scam works, so that whoever's in power introduces the agenda, but the opposition gives the feeling that we're in a free society and we're having a free debate.
[00:27:01.661 --> 00:27:08.305]  Another way the scam works is that they'll give one party a certain image and another party a different image.
[00:27:08.305 --> 00:27:09.586]  For instance, the Labour Party
[00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:22.779]  In Britain has the image, or had it before Blair got involved, of being the party of freedom and against invasions of freedom and privacy and all this stuff.
[00:27:22.779 --> 00:27:30.964]  And the Conservative Party had the image of being for those things, very much more invasive of privacy and stuff like that.
[00:27:30.964 --> 00:27:34.567]  So what they do, and it's the same across the Democrats and Republicans in America,
[00:27:35.781 --> 00:27:45.810]  They put through their most freedom-destroying policies when there's a Labour government in power, because that has the image of not being for that.
[00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.253]  If a Conservative party did it, people would say, or a Republican party,
[00:27:52.095 --> 00:27:54.216]  This is exactly what this party does.
[00:27:54.216 --> 00:27:57.118]  So they do it through the over-posing part of it as a different image.
[00:27:57.118 --> 00:28:01.860]  So David, it's basically good cop, bad cop analogy.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.881]  And then another quick example, you know, they have the left and right here.
[00:28:04.881 --> 00:28:07.943]  Will it be a left-wing world government or a right-wing world government?
[00:28:07.943 --> 00:28:12.025]  The debate, the question is never asked, do we want a world government?
[00:28:12.025 --> 00:28:12.845]  They're setting the debate.
[00:28:12.845 --> 00:28:14.026]  They already used that example.
[00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:14.646]  Another one is,
[00:28:15.206 --> 00:28:30.275]  Colin Powell for years, I'm against the Iraq War, it's wrong, why he might resign, and then right at the last minute, oh, the war's good, it's perfect, and people say, oh, see, he was a dub, but now he's a hawk, oh, it must be good, and it's totally staged.
[00:28:30.855 --> 00:28:31.596]  Right out of the open.
[00:28:31.596 --> 00:28:40.364]  Another example, NRA, National Rifle Association, totally anti-gun, pushes for the most out-of-control gun control laws.
[00:28:40.364 --> 00:28:42.946]  Their members don't even know it.
[00:28:42.946 --> 00:28:44.788]  They won't even tell them.
[00:28:44.788 --> 00:28:45.809]  And here's this group.
[00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:50.053]  Oh, I don't have to get involved in my gun rights because the NRA is doing that for me.
[00:28:50.553 --> 00:28:51.693]  Hmm.
[00:28:51.693 --> 00:28:54.134]  Well, I mean, there's so many examples of it.
[00:28:54.134 --> 00:29:05.276]  For instance, if you want to run drugs and not be investigated, then a great way to run drugs is through an anti-drug agency or administration.
[00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:11.197]  Basically, what we're looking at, the foundation of the whole conspiracy is a mind game.
[00:29:11.197 --> 00:29:14.918]  It's the manipulation of the population's sense of reality.
[00:29:14.918 --> 00:29:17.759]  A great example of this is September the 11th.
[00:29:19.071 --> 00:29:31.281]  So much has happened since then, not least, at least 5,000 civilians and then some dying in Afghanistan as a result of the British and American government bombing.
[00:29:31.281 --> 00:29:40.009]  All these things that have followed on from September the 11th have been justified in the public mind by the official story of 9-11 being true.
[00:29:42.504 --> 00:29:44.006]  It is not!
[00:29:44.006 --> 00:29:57.061]  Therefore, because the people, and it must be 90 odd percent and plus of the global population, have accepted the official story, have allowed themselves to be manipulated to believe a lie,
[00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:05.992]  Everything that has followed from that, including the bombing and the war on terrorism and all this stuff, has been justified.
[00:30:05.992 --> 00:30:17.595]  And they know that if they can manipulate people's sense of reality, in other words, to get them to believe things that suit the agenda, then that's the foundation way.
[00:30:18.315 --> 00:30:26.362]  That they will make it unfold, and the key to that, and you mentioned it earlier, is to get people in fear.
[00:30:26.362 --> 00:30:35.570]  Once people are in fear of something, they look outside of themselves to others, to authority, whatever, to protect them from what they've manipulated to fear.
[00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:42.115]  And that's one key reason why they wish to keep the global population in a constant state of insecurity and fear.
[00:30:43.596 --> 00:30:49.620]  You know, I did my own research from my two videos in my book about September 11th, but I have read your book.
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:57.305]  It is the most comprehensive, and I have to tell you, it's totally documented.
[00:30:57.305 --> 00:31:02.248]  It's all their own admissions, but they never put it all together for you.
[00:31:02.248 --> 00:31:11.053]  It's all fragmented, and much of what is in your book is on PrisonPlanet.com and our 9-1-1 archive, or on InfoWars.com.
[00:31:11.053 --> 00:31:12.234]  It's all right out
[00:31:12.794 --> 00:31:13.575]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:31:28.025 --> 00:31:37.231]  I have found that people can't get over the horror that the government would do this, because they might have to do something about it.
[00:31:37.231 --> 00:31:42.014]  But really, we have so many historical examples, like the Northwoods document, a U.S.
[00:31:42.014 --> 00:31:46.457]  government plan to carry out just this exact type of attack.
[00:31:46.457 --> 00:31:50.400]  And I have to tell you, I think it's more like 30% in the U.S.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.683]  that have now woken up that know it wasn't just prior knowledge, they carried this thing out.
[00:31:56.744 --> 00:32:16.680]  Yeah, I mean, I support everything you've just said, and I think this is why, Alex, it's so important that along with the documentation of the, you know, the political and the economic and media manipulation, people also alongside that have the information about the
[00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:18.289]  We're good to go.
[00:32:42.686 --> 00:33:02.644]  Those that will sacrifice children, those that will abuse children on a vast scale, people like Father George Bush, infamously so, will have no problem whatsoever with killing 3,000 people plus to advance their agenda.
[00:33:04.105 --> 00:33:07.146]  Uh, there was a New York Daily News article a few months ago.
[00:33:07.146 --> 00:33:16.890]  I had the lawyer on, declassified document confirmed, no debate, just a few articles, massive story, should have been top story for weeks.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:36.666]  Calmly, they got the Roosevelt documents signed by him, where he ordered our troops, our sailors, not to let 7,000 men, women, and children, civilians, American citizens, on the ships, and the ships were half empty, to take them out of the Philippines, so they could be captured by the Japanese, the documents said, for war propaganda purposes.
[00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:39.907]  Now that's snuffing out, and over half of them were killed and died.
[00:33:39.907 --> 00:33:45.349]  7,000 people just for propaganda purposes, they're caught doing it,
[00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:52.192]  Sixty years later, it's calmly reported like it's no big deal.
[00:33:52.192 --> 00:34:02.886]  You've got your London Guardian, about ten other papers three months ago, four months ago, reported that MI6 calmly has done most of the bombings in London and in Ireland.
[00:34:03.666 --> 00:34:14.210]  In the last twenty-three years, twenty-four years now since Margaret Thatcher started it, they just calmly announced, yeah, we've been doing most of the bombings to be legitimate with the terrorists.
[00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:19.632]  How do they take massive stories and just calmly report, yeah, we do this, yeah, we do that?
[00:34:21.136 --> 00:34:34.141]  Well, one of the key elements, I think, to appreciating the way that people are manipulated in all these ways is the understanding they have that people do not retain detail.
[00:34:34.141 --> 00:34:36.982]  Even people who read newspapers, very few actually retain detail.
[00:34:36.982 --> 00:34:41.843]  And people who get their news, most people from television, retain no detail at all.
[00:34:41.843 --> 00:34:44.804]  What they retain is an image, a feeling.
[00:34:47.279 --> 00:34:48.680]  I'm not a physics major.
[00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:17.671]  A paper passport from one of the hijackers has just been found near ground zero, where vast numbers of bodies have never been found right the way through.
[00:35:17.671 --> 00:35:19.752]  It is utterly ludicrous.
[00:35:19.752 --> 00:35:31.238]  But I sat in this very chair, Alex, and I watched on this television here a BBC newsreader on national news calmly, without any questioning at all, announce that this had been found.
[00:35:31.238 --> 00:35:35.761]  What happened is, when I was researching the book, I went back to the New York police to say, well, hold on.
[00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:41.698]  Could you just tell me whose passport of these hijackers you're naming it belonged to?
[00:35:41.698 --> 00:35:46.045]  And I was told I couldn't get that information because there was an ongoing investigation and what have you.
[00:35:46.045 --> 00:35:50.431]  And then on the anniversary of September the 11th, what, six months or so ago now,
[00:35:51.933 --> 00:36:02.120]  An ITV documentary asked that question also, and the FBI's reply was, the hijacker passport, wait for this, is a rumor that might be true.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.662]  This is a year after they called a news conference to announce they'd actually found it.
[00:36:05.662 --> 00:36:06.923]  Let me stop you, let me stop you.
[00:36:06.923 --> 00:36:16.230]  Khalid Mohammed, there was a report, Asian Times, a Reuters report, in October, early October of last year,
[00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:20.492]  They announced it, and when I saw the article, I went, oh yeah, I remember that.
[00:36:20.492 --> 00:36:25.434]  Big victory, they've killed Khalid Mohammed in his home, captured his children and his wife.
[00:36:25.434 --> 00:36:38.401]  Then this weekend, we've captured him, he's alive, and then ABC News, we've got his son, his sons, seven and nine, we're going to torture them so he'll answer questions, and then it says, but we're not torturing.
[00:36:38.741 --> 00:36:46.994]  I mean, it's just insane Orwellian doublespeak worse than what Winston saw at the Ministry of Treaty in Oceania in 1984.
[00:36:46.994 --> 00:36:53.685]  The point is that they know because of this phenomena that people do not retain detail.
[00:36:54.265 --> 00:37:02.472]  That they can say A at this time and they can say Z at another time and people will not connect the two and see the contradiction.
[00:37:02.472 --> 00:37:12.900]  It's only people like you, me and other people investigating this that put A to Z and B to D so that people can say, hey, how can they say that and then say that?
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.623]  Unless that happens, people just don't make the connection and they get away with it.
[00:37:17.464 --> 00:37:19.507]  It appears to be swapping on purpose.
[00:37:19.507 --> 00:37:24.994]  I mean, they could have easily sent some other guy under some name and show a picture of anybody and say, this is the mastermind.
[00:37:24.994 --> 00:37:25.775]  Why do they?
[00:37:25.775 --> 00:37:27.938]  It's like they're getting caught on purpose.
[00:37:27.938 --> 00:37:29.761]  It's like they're ridiculous lies.
[00:37:29.761 --> 00:37:32.324]  Is this like an inside joke or something?
[00:37:33.025 --> 00:37:48.688]  Well, my feeling is, and I can only give my opinion on what I feel, I feel that these guys are in a state of panic now, and I think this is one of the key reasons they're trying to push this on so rapidly, is because there is an awakening going on.
[00:37:49.807 --> 00:37:55.149]  When I first started talking about this a year ago, a decade ago, a man and a dog used to turn up.
[00:37:55.149 --> 00:37:59.711]  I mean, you're talking to the man who pulled in a crowd of eight in Chicago, Alex.
[00:37:59.711 --> 00:38:07.674]  That doesn't happen now, because there is an awakening going on, and people are starting to see through more and more and more of what's actually happening.
[00:38:07.674 --> 00:38:08.514]  And this is one of the
[00:38:09.272 --> 00:38:10.753]  No, I hardly agree, and I think that
[00:38:33.288 --> 00:38:35.490]  Because there's only a few thousand top technicians.
[00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:36.791]  I think they're overstretched.
[00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:44.078]  I think their compartmentalization is breaking down, and they are having trouble command and controlling all of this.
[00:38:44.078 --> 00:38:48.501]  And whereas you had eight people a few years ago, now it's thousands coming to hear you speak.
[00:38:48.501 --> 00:38:55.467]  I've done 700 radio interviews in the last year and a half, and one out of 30 callers calls in to disagree.
[00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:58.190]  And I'm on the air saying it as hardcore as it gets, David.
[00:38:59.631 --> 00:39:15.595]  Yeah, I think what's happening is that up to this point, up to shows like yours and researchers and what have you who have started to put this together and communicate it, people only had one version of possibility, i.e.
[00:39:15.595 --> 00:39:17.376]  political parties were not connected and
[00:39:18.096 --> 00:39:18.657]  I don't know.
[00:39:36.587 --> 00:39:37.167]  I don't think so.
[00:39:49.381 --> 00:40:03.811]  Waking up to this and coming to the conclusion that, no, we can discuss the detail, but the themes we agree on, but the themes actually are correct and they are people who would have laughed in your face a year ago or two years ago.
[00:40:03.811 --> 00:40:06.913]  This is a wonderful time, this, Alex.
[00:40:06.913 --> 00:40:13.938]  This tyranny is unraveling and we need to keep going and expand this so it continues to unravel.
[00:40:15.549 --> 00:40:18.352]  Well, they're going to use more terrorism to try to get us back in line.
[00:40:18.352 --> 00:40:24.018]  I don't want people to underestimate the scorched earth policy that they do plan to take.
[00:40:24.018 --> 00:40:25.499]  And I want to talk about the microchips.
[00:40:25.499 --> 00:40:30.284]  I mean, I remember reading one of your books five years ago where you talked about the microchip population.
[00:40:30.284 --> 00:40:35.230]  I remember reading Army documents three years ago, and we were kooks to talk about it, and now it's, take your chips!
[00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:35.770]  It's good!
[00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:37.031]  It's good!
[00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:38.353]  It's the craziness of it!
[00:40:39.489 --> 00:40:45.091]  I mean, I think they've gone too fast because they know it's unraveling, and that now they've even shown more of their hand.
[00:40:45.091 --> 00:40:46.351]  Do you agree?
[00:40:46.351 --> 00:40:55.054]  Yeah, and you know, we have a president who's really, he's a smoking bomb, really, from their point of view.
[00:40:55.054 --> 00:40:59.835]  Alright, I want to come back and jam three calls into this next five, six minute segment.
[00:40:59.835 --> 00:41:07.598]  I want to start the second hour, come back and take more calls, and then get back into David's analysis of what life would be like under the New World Order if we don't defeat it.
[00:41:08.538 --> 00:41:12.420]  Uh, and we'll also tell you how to get to Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center disaster.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.182]  We have a link to his website, DavidIke.com.
[00:41:15.182 --> 00:41:18.123]  Now, we have some tough questions, too, coming up in the next, uh, hour.
[00:41:18.123 --> 00:41:18.643]  Stay with us.
[00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:19.484]  Thanks for joining us, David.
[00:41:26.869 --> 00:41:28.651]  There's a war on for your mind.
[00:41:44.889 --> 00:41:47.951]  1-888-253-3139 to order Don't Wake at the Films.
[00:41:47.951 --> 00:41:51.173]  1-888-253-3139 and spread them in your community.
[00:41:51.173 --> 00:41:52.134]  Wake the people up.
[00:41:52.134 --> 00:41:52.174]  888-253-3139.
[00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:07.842]  Jeff, Mark and Doug, we're going to try to get to you right now.
[00:42:07.842 --> 00:42:11.263]  David Icke, real quick, and we'll do a better plug for it in the next hour.
[00:42:11.263 --> 00:42:16.244]  How do folks get your latest book, Alice Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disasters?
[00:42:16.244 --> 00:42:19.085]  Well, they can get it through DavidIcke.com or a number, 888-609-5006.
[00:42:19.085 --> 00:42:19.125]  888-609-5006.
[00:42:27.427 --> 00:42:28.547]  We're good to go.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.921]  All right, or DavidIke.com.
[00:42:56.921 --> 00:43:01.005]  Let's talk to, real quick, Jeff.
[00:43:01.005 --> 00:43:02.126]  Jeff's calling from Missouri.
[00:43:02.126 --> 00:43:02.687]  Jeff, go ahead.
[00:43:02.687 --> 00:43:04.308]  You're on the air with David Ike.
[00:43:04.308 --> 00:43:05.589]  Hello, gentlemen.
[00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:14.618]  David, I saw you on the Trio Network along with Alex over a week of where they had the show, Dealing with the Secret Rules of the World.
[00:43:14.618 --> 00:43:15.919]  And I have to apologize.
[00:43:15.919 --> 00:43:18.642]  I have to apologize for saying something mean about David on that.
[00:43:19.878 --> 00:43:20.699]  Hold on a second, Jeff.
[00:43:20.699 --> 00:43:24.666]  Those guys followed me around, hopping on for two years, and anything bad I said over two years got thrown in there.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:37.703]  I wouldn't trust the presenter of that show as far as I could throw him the arm.
[00:43:37.703 --> 00:43:41.465]  His book is a fairy tale.
[00:43:41.465 --> 00:43:44.106]  It takes real stuff and turns it into a joke.
[00:43:44.106 --> 00:43:45.327]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:43:45.327 --> 00:43:46.287]  I'm sorry, Jeff, go ahead.
[00:43:46.287 --> 00:43:47.288]  You were saying something?
[00:43:47.288 --> 00:43:50.049]  At any rate, no, Alex, just a little side remark.
[00:43:50.049 --> 00:43:57.013]  The remark and the analogy you made about the dog extra will always stick in my wife and I's mind for quite some time.
[00:43:58.053 --> 00:43:58.574]  No, I don't think so.
[00:44:12.415 --> 00:44:22.361]  My wife and I kind of looked at each other because from a biblical standpoint there was a time in Genesis 6 when the fallen angels went into the daughters of men and bore them children.
[00:44:22.361 --> 00:44:23.822]  Noah was perfect.
[00:44:23.822 --> 00:44:26.324]  I wanted to get into this in the next hour.
[00:44:26.324 --> 00:44:29.906]  I'd like to too because the gentleman is absolutely right.
[00:44:29.906 --> 00:44:36.450]  When you look at biblical references, you look at references from ancient societies around the world, there is a common theme here.
[00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.312]  But I believe it's spiritual.
[00:44:39.312 --> 00:44:41.093]  And that's where we'll probably disagree.
[00:44:41.093 --> 00:44:42.214]  Jeff, thank you for coming.
[00:44:42.214 --> 00:44:44.875]  Well, I don't believe it's physical either.
[00:44:44.875 --> 00:44:48.838]  I think we're looking at other dimensional entities that possess human form.
[00:44:48.838 --> 00:44:54.001]  I don't think we're necessarily looking at people in space helmets, mate, no.
[00:44:54.001 --> 00:44:59.004]  There is a guiding spiritual force at Grand Design on both sides of this thing.
[00:44:59.004 --> 00:45:00.605]  Let's talk to Mark in Minnesota.
[00:45:00.605 --> 00:45:01.346]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:45:01.346 --> 00:45:01.686]  Go ahead.
[00:45:04.415 --> 00:45:05.976]  Okay, Mark, are you there?
[00:45:05.976 --> 00:45:06.496]  I'm here.
[00:45:06.496 --> 00:45:07.396]  Hey, how are you guys doing?
[00:45:07.396 --> 00:45:07.696]  Fine.
[00:45:07.696 --> 00:45:08.497]  Go ahead, Mark.
[00:45:08.497 --> 00:45:13.359]  Yeah, actually, that's what I wanted to bring up, the reptilian stuff.
[00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:17.740]  I mean, what empirical evidence do you have to support that?
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:23.482]  See, that's my criticism point, is that you add this as a cherry on top, that's the one or two percent.
[00:45:23.482 --> 00:45:26.484]  Everything else is documented mainstream, and then this gets added.
[00:45:26.484 --> 00:45:28.584]  We're going to have to cover this next hour.
[00:45:31.521 --> 00:45:37.383]  Well, I want to point out, actually, George Bush, he's a ninth cousin of mine.
[00:45:37.383 --> 00:45:40.324]  Everybody has millions of ninth cousins.
[00:45:40.324 --> 00:45:44.745]  In fact, George Bush is probably related to about half of America, distantly, very distantly.
[00:45:44.745 --> 00:45:48.186]  Yeah, but to the royals in England, he's very closely related.
[00:45:48.186 --> 00:45:56.248]  I mean, I think that sort of destroys the idea that he's some sort of... I'll tell you what.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:58.581]  The third hour is coming up, Mark.
[00:45:58.581 --> 00:46:03.064]  You stay there and then David can talk to you when we get back.
[00:46:03.064 --> 00:46:05.525]  This is the one percent of the story that everybody wants to talk about.
[00:46:05.525 --> 00:46:09.367]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:09.367 --> 00:46:11.328]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:46:11.328 --> 00:46:12.129]  I mean real.
[00:46:12.129 --> 00:46:15.551]  Hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes...
[00:46:16.434 --> 00:46:23.237]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk Archives, and we are listener-supported with the Honors System.
[00:46:23.237 --> 00:46:24.878]  We ask that you wait.
[00:46:24.878 --> 00:46:26.759]  Don't donate a dollar at a time.
[00:46:26.759 --> 00:46:32.342]  PayPal charges a 35-cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[00:46:32.342 --> 00:46:35.864]  Wait till you listen to five or ten, and then donate, please.
[00:46:35.864 --> 00:46:38.165]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:44.767]  Big Brother.
[00:46:44.767 --> 00:46:46.548]  Mainstream media.
[00:46:46.548 --> 00:46:48.329]  Government cover-ups.
[00:46:48.329 --> 00:46:49.869]  You want answers?
[00:46:49.869 --> 00:46:51.450]  Well, so does he.
[00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:55.631]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:46:55.631 --> 00:47:01.593]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:47:01.593 --> 00:47:06.895]  Alright, we're talking to David Icke, BBC, Sports Anchor,
[00:47:09.182 --> 00:47:17.189]  Soccer champion, goalie, best-selling author, lecturer, and he has a great understanding.
[00:47:17.189 --> 00:47:26.177]  98% of what he covers, and I've read three or four of his books and watched a couple of his videos, is very, very accurate and totally documented out in the open, and he's very insightful about that.
[00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:30.982]  Then there's the one or two percent, you know, getting into who runs the New World Order,
[00:47:32.058 --> 00:47:39.464]  That people have a problem with, and him saying it's spiritual, I would agree with him more now, because the globalists do believe in this.
[00:47:39.464 --> 00:47:40.785]  They are devil worshippers.
[00:47:40.785 --> 00:47:45.409]  I've been to Bohemian Grove, and what is the Bible's description of this devil?
[00:47:45.409 --> 00:47:45.729]  It is a snake.
[00:47:50.391 --> 00:47:56.794]  Can I just put this into context, Alex, so that people understand what I'm saying here about this.
[00:47:56.794 --> 00:48:08.419]  A little while ago I was talking about the fact that these bloodlines moved out of the ancient world into Europe and became the aristocracy and the royal families of Europe and then through the colonial empires expanded around the world.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:21.787]  There is a connection between the way that they used to do rituals, sacrificial rituals, and what have you, in the ancient world, and what they do today in Babylon.
[00:48:21.787 --> 00:48:27.530]  I picked up, and again, the caller Jeff, who mentioned this, is absolutely right.
[00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:38.397]  When you look at the biblical references, and you look at the ancient accounts of peoples around the world, I mean, I've got a great friend in South Africa who's now an 80-odd year old,
[00:48:38.937 --> 00:48:39.237]  Yeah, I
[00:49:03.555 --> 00:49:05.237]  Well, hold on a minute.
[00:49:05.237 --> 00:49:13.330]  When you follow these bloodlines through, these royal bloodlines, you find that there is this idea of a divine right to rule.
[00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:15.214]  So what the heck is that?
[00:49:15.214 --> 00:49:17.758]  And then you start to pick up this theme of
[00:49:18.916 --> 00:49:19.336]  I think?
[00:49:34.189 --> 00:49:36.170]  Because these people are already bizarre.
[00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:39.392]  We know they go to Bohemian Grove and worship Moloch the Owl.
[00:49:39.392 --> 00:49:40.572]  They think they're gods.
[00:49:40.572 --> 00:49:42.873]  They say that they are descended from this.
[00:49:42.873 --> 00:49:44.874]  And we know that that's what the Illuminati thinks.
[00:49:44.874 --> 00:49:47.356]  They call us bugs, useless feeders.
[00:49:47.356 --> 00:49:50.317]  So whether it's real or not, you're saying this is what they believe.
[00:49:50.317 --> 00:49:52.338]  I'm saying it's real.
[00:49:52.338 --> 00:49:54.139]  I'm saying it's real in this sense.
[00:49:54.139 --> 00:49:59.202]  The common theme, biblical and otherwise, is of what are termed demonic entities.
[00:49:59.722 --> 00:50:00.122]  We're good to go.
[00:50:10.058 --> 00:50:24.750]  And one of the things that is happening in many of these rituals that span these hundreds and hundreds of years to the present day is that during the ritual, the situation is created in which this possession takes place.
[00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.651]  It's worth pointing this out.
[00:50:26.651 --> 00:50:30.174]  When we look through our eyes, we think we're looking at a world.
[00:50:30.174 --> 00:50:32.416]  We think we're seeing everything there is to see.
[00:50:33.156 --> 00:50:36.659]  What we're actually seeing is just a frequency range.
[00:50:36.659 --> 00:50:39.582]  It's the frequency range that our five senses, i.e.
[00:50:39.582 --> 00:50:43.004]  our sight, etc., can perceive.
[00:50:43.004 --> 00:50:46.948]  Yeah, we don't see 90% of even the light spectrum.
[00:50:46.948 --> 00:50:47.408]  Exactly.
[00:50:48.649 --> 00:50:49.289]  I think so.
[00:51:07.978 --> 00:51:15.703]  Yes, the cat's visual frequency range is greater than ours, and therefore, to the cat, that is not empty space.
[00:51:15.703 --> 00:51:17.904]  It is something there that they can see.
[00:51:17.904 --> 00:51:19.105]  That's what they're reacting to.
[00:51:19.105 --> 00:51:20.886]  Now, the point I'm leading to is this.
[00:51:20.886 --> 00:51:21.727]  We got a break.
[00:51:21.727 --> 00:51:22.967]  We got a break.
[00:51:22.967 --> 00:51:23.548]  Okay.
[00:51:23.548 --> 00:51:24.288]  Pardon me?
[00:51:24.288 --> 00:51:26.690]  I'll come back after the break.
[00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:27.450]  Yes, yes.
[00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:30.092]  Sir, we've got 15 minutes left, roughly.
[00:51:31.077 --> 00:51:34.879]  Uh, and I do want to go to these calls, and I want to get into all the stuff we can't breathe here.
[00:51:34.879 --> 00:51:42.104]  I got some questions, but we'll go back into this when we get back.
[00:51:42.104 --> 00:51:43.404]  Big Brother.
[00:51:43.404 --> 00:51:45.185]  Mainstream media.
[00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:46.966]  Government cover-ups.
[00:51:46.966 --> 00:51:48.527]  You want answers?
[00:51:48.527 --> 00:51:50.088]  Well, so does he.
[00:51:50.088 --> 00:51:54.271]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:54.271 --> 00:51:58.373]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:02.276 --> 00:52:08.677]  There is a double-edged sword effect to what David Icke does.
[00:52:08.677 --> 00:52:11.518]  98% of it totally provable and demonstrated by fact.
[00:52:11.518 --> 00:52:14.218]  But you can go out and verify.
[00:52:14.218 --> 00:52:17.079]  2% he would say documented, I would say speculative.
[00:52:17.079 --> 00:52:18.679]  But, here's the problem.
[00:52:18.679 --> 00:52:25.540]  3, 4, 5 years ago when I read the government documents about microchips for you and your family and how they were going to try to sell it to you.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:29.581]  In 2000, Army War College reported how they'd use the media to sell it to you.
[00:52:29.581 --> 00:52:31.261]  Talking about how weak-minded we are.
[00:52:32.193 --> 00:52:39.098]  And now, last year, the news blitz, every child needs a microchip, wall-to-wall coverage, a hundred times a day for months on end.
[00:52:40.416 --> 00:52:41.677]  Who would have ever thought that would happen?
[00:52:41.677 --> 00:52:44.058]  Who would ever think they'd be on the news saying torture is good?
[00:52:44.058 --> 00:52:46.380]  And, oh, our government's going to use some of the weapons on Iraq?
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.521]  That's okay, but it's not okay if they use it.
[00:52:48.521 --> 00:52:54.605]  Who would have ever thought they'd be out in the open in the New York Times two weeks ago saying it's a new world order for the UN to run America?
[00:52:54.605 --> 00:53:01.790]  Who would ever think the Associated Press would report that foreign groups are massing for, quote, anti-terrorism operations here in the US?
[00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:03.091]  But that's all documented!
[00:53:05.039 --> 00:53:13.226]  But there is a danger, and we have all this incredible stuff that we can prove that people can't still believe, some of them, to go into things that we cannot completely prove.
[00:53:13.226 --> 00:53:14.127]  And I'll give you an example.
[00:53:14.127 --> 00:53:17.990]  I told you a couple weeks ago I had the roofers at my house putting a new roof on.
[00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:23.754]  And the guy walks up and he goes, you know, I recognize your voice over the phone when you were setting up this job.
[00:53:23.754 --> 00:53:27.357]  I just wanted to tell you my dad, you know, knows about this new world order.
[00:53:27.357 --> 00:53:29.499]  I thought he was crazy.
[00:53:29.499 --> 00:53:32.562]  He goes, do you really believe there's a trilateral commission?
[00:53:32.562 --> 00:53:34.243]  And he'd heard my show, he said, many times.
[00:53:34.981 --> 00:53:39.864]  I said, sir, the Trilateral Commission is a public organization with offices in New York and D.C.
[00:53:39.864 --> 00:53:40.985]  They call for world government.
[00:53:40.985 --> 00:53:42.045]  They have publications.
[00:53:42.045 --> 00:53:46.568]  They have presidents and people as members.
[00:53:46.568 --> 00:53:49.130]  That's like saying, is the world really round?
[00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:51.211]  Does the sun really come up in the morning?
[00:53:51.211 --> 00:53:52.832]  Was there really a George Washington?
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:54:01.226]  So, if people have trouble with that, you know, when I went and shot video of Police State 2000, troops trying to take your guns and put you in camps.
[00:54:01.226 --> 00:54:05.870]  I mean, this was up close, color video, them saying it, them doing it, news articles on top of it.
[00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:07.272]  People couldn't believe that.
[00:54:07.272 --> 00:54:08.212]  Therein lies the danger.
[00:54:08.212 --> 00:54:10.234]  We were going to go to Mark in Minnesota, but he hung up.
[00:54:10.234 --> 00:54:16.440]  I'm going to give him a chance to, because he wanted to ask questions of Mr. Ike, but we do have a bunch of other callers.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.641]  David, you were trying to make a point.
[00:54:17.641 --> 00:54:18.902]  Go ahead and finish that point.
[00:54:18.902 --> 00:54:19.863]  Let's go on to some other calls.
[00:54:20.243 --> 00:54:21.725]  Okay, well a couple of things.
[00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:27.214]  As I was saying when I was last speaking, just outside...
[00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:48.738]  The frequency range of the five senses, that which our eyes can see, not that it's actually our eyes that see, it's our brain that sees, and that's another area of manipulation, but is where these entities live, which have been mentioned and documented throughout history in their various forms under the collective term of demonic entities.
[00:54:48.738 --> 00:54:49.779]  Now, all I'm saying
[00:54:51.267 --> 00:55:13.468]  Not in my experience of sitting in a darkened room contemplating what I think is going on, by talking to hundreds of people around the world from every different walk of life you can imagine, who have had the experience of seeing these entities, overwhelmingly, in the experience of people that I've talked to, they seem to take a reptilian type form, and are possessing
[00:55:15.929 --> 00:55:22.373]  The people who are in positions, major positions of power, and therefore controlling their mental and emotional processes.
[00:55:22.373 --> 00:55:27.756]  I'm saying nothing new compared with what people have been saying for hundreds of years, including biblical references.
[00:55:27.756 --> 00:55:32.759]  Well, you're right, and the Bible says that these principalities run the high places.
[00:55:32.759 --> 00:55:39.183]  Well, if the leader is running it, that means that they have been controlled.
[00:55:39.183 --> 00:55:42.325]  And how do you describe this evil, this lack of conscience?
[00:55:43.085 --> 00:55:58.379]  This compulsion to commit huge wars and kill hundreds of millions of people, and that ritual at Bohemian Grove, this is what opened my eyes up to some of what you're saying, those little rituals at Bohemian Grove, it was about not having a conscience.
[00:55:58.379 --> 00:55:59.920]  It was about getting rid of care.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:05.886]  Yeah, the other thing, Alex, is another theme that I've picked up over a decade or more of research.
[00:56:06.546 --> 00:56:07.167]  I don't know.
[00:56:22.217 --> 00:56:22.958]  We're good.
[00:56:39.913 --> 00:56:40.433]  I don't know.
[00:57:09.873 --> 00:57:11.615]  Well, let me just say this.
[00:57:11.615 --> 00:57:12.697]  I talk about legislation.
[00:57:12.697 --> 00:57:14.439]  I talk about the New World Order.
[00:57:14.439 --> 00:57:16.021]  I will say, yes, the leaders are satanic.
[00:57:26.585 --> 00:57:43.218]  Because, I mean, ABC News, skull and bones, they catch video of the satanic ritual, flooding women's throats, blood spraying on ABC News, a lot of you have seen the video, national television, Fox ran it, and they said, oh, they're just having fun, there's no police investigation, was that real or was it simulated?
[00:57:43.218 --> 00:57:48.222]  I go to the Grove, a bound body, begging for its life, the Grove admits on national television, worldwide,
[00:57:48.602 --> 00:57:49.643]  I did get that footage.
[00:57:49.643 --> 00:57:53.926]  That is real, they're saying, but it's just a theater, a theatrical thing.
[00:57:53.926 --> 00:58:02.672]  But then we see these leaders in the real world carrying out wars, carrying out mass killing, which is where they're so... I agree that they believe this.
[00:58:02.672 --> 00:58:05.174]  I agree they believe in the devil.
[00:58:05.174 --> 00:58:07.836]  I agree that there is a devil.
[00:58:07.836 --> 00:58:13.460]  But at that point, you see, I don't attach the whole new world, even though it's at the head of it,
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:19.802]  What happens is, you go out and attach that to this, the average person won't be able to come to terms with it.
[00:58:19.802 --> 00:58:20.802]  Let's take some calls.
[00:58:20.802 --> 00:58:24.363]  Well, that's not been my experience, I must say.
[00:58:24.363 --> 00:58:37.146]  Alright, well, I'm telling you that when I go out and talk about the New World Order, occasionally, the few criticisms I get, oh, you're like that David Icke guy, you know, you believe this is going on, and it's being used as a discrediting mechanism.
[00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:41.307]  Yeah, the point is, though, Alex, you know, that we are a tapestry.
[00:58:41.907 --> 00:58:42.247]  I think so.
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:58:59.061]  We're good.
[00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:20.314]  The way that these children were being sacrificed and abused by people like George Bush and others.
[00:59:20.314 --> 00:59:25.918]  People would now not, further along the line, be opening up to this.
[00:59:25.918 --> 00:59:28.140]  Someone has to throw it in there first.
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:31.482]  Otherwise, it never moves and never expands.
[00:59:31.482 --> 00:59:36.626]  If someone had not said the Earth was round and not flat, how long would people have gone on believing it was flat?
[00:59:36.626 --> 00:59:38.007]  Well, that's an example I use.
[00:59:38.007 --> 00:59:38.428]  Now listen.
[00:59:39.408 --> 00:59:40.990]  You're not being censored here.
[00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:43.772]  I mean, I know they want to try to ban you from Canada and all that.
[00:59:43.772 --> 00:59:46.195]  I think that's ridiculous, but I'm here.
[00:59:46.195 --> 00:59:47.095]  We're talking about it.
[00:59:47.095 --> 00:59:51.319]  I'm telling you, we're discussing this situation.
[00:59:51.319 --> 00:59:58.466]  We're going over it and I think it's been revealing now, but we got to go these calls, but I've got to say this again for those who just tuned in.
[00:59:59.685 --> 01:00:17.402]  All of you may not have heard of Bohemian Grove, but you've heard about Skull & Bones, Four or Five Generations of Bushes, most CIA directors, this elite Blue Blood, New Haven, Connecticut, Skull & Bones, they do worship Satan, it is MSNBC, they talked to 100 members, the US branch of the Bavarian Illuminati,
[01:00:18.408 --> 01:00:22.212]  That is a fact, and that's hard for people to believe, but that's out in the open.
[01:00:22.212 --> 01:00:27.116]  They do have Paul Bonacci in his diary, and this is a state senator who wrote the book.
[01:00:27.116 --> 01:00:28.378]  He's never been sued.
[01:00:28.378 --> 01:00:31.841]  A TV station in Virginia said it wasn't true.
[01:00:31.841 --> 01:00:34.603]  He sued them for $1.3 million, won.
[01:00:34.603 --> 01:00:39.408]  He has the diaries, the police reports, and one of his later editions added something that he didn't put in the first one.
[01:00:39.748 --> 01:00:51.613]  About Paul Bonacci and these kids, mentioning Northern California, and this happening, and we know that the Aztecs did this, we know that the ancient tribes all over did this.
[01:00:51.613 --> 01:00:53.374]  Why is it the same ritual?
[01:00:53.374 --> 01:00:55.534]  Why is it the same activity?
[01:00:55.534 --> 01:00:56.495]  Why do we see this?
[01:00:56.495 --> 01:00:58.636]  And that is a legitimate point.
[01:00:58.636 --> 01:01:02.257]  And it is bizarre, it is out of control, but it is happening.
[01:01:02.257 --> 01:01:05.518]  Let's talk to Doug in Delaware, who's been holding for about an hour.
[01:01:05.518 --> 01:01:07.099]  Go ahead, Doug, you're on the air.
[01:01:07.099 --> 01:01:08.380]  Hi, Alex, and hi, David.
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:13.082]  I had about a million questions for you, but I think I can narrow it down to two.
[01:01:13.082 --> 01:01:16.983]  I haven't got a million answers, mate.
[01:01:16.983 --> 01:01:20.385]  I've got more questions than anyone listening to this show, I tell you.
[01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:21.365]  I imagine you do.
[01:01:21.365 --> 01:01:25.267]  The first thought that I had was, do you think that simply by
[01:01:26.619 --> 01:01:37.266]  Delving into these types of subjects about the source of all these evils we're seeing and learning and being aware is like winning half the battle, say.
[01:01:37.266 --> 01:01:50.195]  Well, yeah, because, you know, the Illuminati do not run around trying to control our sources of information to give us their version of events rather than the true version because they get fun out of it.
[01:01:50.575 --> 01:01:54.959]  They do it because it is fundamental to them controlling us.
[01:01:54.959 --> 01:01:56.840]  They're controlling our reality.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:04.786]  And our reality, our sense of belief, our sense of ourselves, and our sense of the world, is what fundamentally dictates our physical behavior.
[01:02:04.786 --> 01:02:11.031]  I'm sitting here with a phone in my hand, not because my body's decided to do it, but my mind decided to do it.
[01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:17.897]  So if you like, for want of a term, and I don't like it, the battleground is actually the human mind, the human perception.
[01:02:17.897 --> 01:02:18.957]  And crucial to that is
[01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:30.909]  Keeping from that human mind information that would get us to see what's going on and emphasizing constantly only that which leads us to a false reality of what's going on.
[01:02:30.909 --> 01:02:38.537]  So awareness is absolutely the bottom line of bringing this whole network to an end.
[01:02:38.537 --> 01:02:40.899]  You shall know the truth and truth will set you free.
[01:02:40.899 --> 01:02:42.561]  My people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:02:43.203 --> 01:02:53.412]  Okay, I have one more quick question, and that is, in your reptilian theory, how many do you think of, let's say, ordinary people have this bloodline?
[01:02:53.412 --> 01:02:54.412]  For example, I'm Irish.
[01:02:54.412 --> 01:02:55.814]  Well, you're saying it's just possession.
[01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:56.734]  Go ahead.
[01:02:56.734 --> 01:02:59.737]  Well, I'm saying it's possession, but I'm saying this.
[01:02:59.737 --> 01:03:03.940]  There had to be a reason, and then I was just asking questions about things that were obviously
[01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:05.621]  True.
[01:03:05.621 --> 01:03:09.903]  Why are these Illuminati families so obsessed with interbreeding with each other, as they still are?
[01:03:09.903 --> 01:03:13.964]  I mean, look at the aristocratic families and royal families of Europe.
[01:03:13.964 --> 01:03:17.026]  To this day, they interbreed with each other.
[01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:18.066]  Why?
[01:03:18.066 --> 01:03:28.090]  Talking to people that have been involved in these rituals, talking to people who have been close to people like Princess Diana, a close confidant of hers for nine years,
[01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:32.076]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:03:32.076 --> 01:03:33.838]  I know this, they are occultists.
[01:03:33.838 --> 01:03:36.182]  What they are, who they are, we've got to figure that out.
[01:03:37.935 --> 01:03:44.757]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk Archives, and we are listener-supported with the Honors System.
[01:03:44.757 --> 01:03:46.397]  We ask that you wait.
[01:03:46.397 --> 01:03:48.278]  Don't donate a dollar at a time.
[01:03:48.278 --> 01:03:53.859]  PayPal charges a 35-cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[01:03:53.859 --> 01:03:57.380]  Wait till you listen to five or ten, and then donate, please.
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.681]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[01:04:18.957 --> 01:04:20.918]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[01:04:20.918 --> 01:04:25.019]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[01:04:25.019 --> 01:04:27.640]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:35.963]  We're talking to obviously controversial anti-New World Order crusader researcher David Icke.
[01:04:35.963 --> 01:04:39.224]  And the globalists are into satanic rituals.
[01:04:39.224 --> 01:04:41.145]  That is proven, admitted, mainstream.
[01:04:42.639 --> 01:04:44.060]  Now, do you believe in a devil?
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:49.184]  Do you believe in those types of things?
[01:04:49.184 --> 01:04:57.990]  I know I certainly do, and that is a perfect example and description of why they're acting and behaving like this, turning our planet into a prison planet.
[01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:03.473]  David, we've got a lot of callers here, but you had a point you were trying to make when we slammed into that last break.
[01:05:03.473 --> 01:05:04.194]  Go ahead.
[01:05:04.194 --> 01:05:05.735]  Yes, I was just saying that
[01:05:07.363 --> 01:05:22.535]  I've met so many people, including a lady called Christine Fitzgerald, who was a close confidante of Princess Diana for nine years, who I met after Diana's death, not to talk about anything like this, but to talk about what she knew about the way the Windsors treated Diana and what the relationship was.
[01:05:22.535 --> 01:05:24.356]  And right out of the blue, she said to me,
[01:05:25.495 --> 01:05:25.895]  I don't think so.
[01:05:47.478 --> 01:05:58.688]  Well, the way I've come up with this whole area of information and research is simply by the number of people I've met around the world that have told me basically the same story.
[01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:03.552]  So you follow the New World Order back and it always runs into this demonic situation?
[01:06:03.872 --> 01:06:19.769]  Yeah, well this is the point, Alex, you know, when you, and many people have done this now, when you research back over hundreds of years and thousands of years, and you can follow this theme, a question that people ask me, and it's a relevant one on the face of it, is, hold on a minute, if this is the case,
[01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:38.957]  Why would all these different people, going back thousands of years, why would they work themselves through their physical lifetimes trying to advance and create a global kind of controlling state when they knew they were going to be long gone before it came?
[01:06:38.957 --> 01:06:43.599]  There had to be, Alex, a common theme which spanned
[01:06:44.759 --> 01:06:54.686]  The centuries of this manipulation, and with its common force and source, and it is these entities that possess these particular bloodlines.
[01:06:54.686 --> 01:06:56.207]  Well, they certainly believe in this.
[01:06:56.207 --> 01:07:00.270]  They certainly are satanic, and that's what we can prove.
[01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:04.492]  And let's talk to Regina in Pennsylvania.
[01:07:04.492 --> 01:07:06.034]  Regina, you're on the air with David Icke.
[01:07:06.034 --> 01:07:06.434]  Go ahead.
[01:07:06.434 --> 01:07:08.535]  Hi, Alex.
[01:07:08.535 --> 01:07:09.816]  Hi, Dave Icke.
[01:07:09.816 --> 01:07:12.017]  I've heard about you, and I was encouraged to get your book.
[01:07:13.635 --> 01:07:16.357]  I'm encouraged to talk to you a little bit.
[01:07:16.357 --> 01:07:20.901]  When you bring up the centralization, I'd like to cue in here.
[01:07:20.901 --> 01:07:29.528]  This situation right now with Alex bringing up at the beginning of his show about what was happening on the street last night.
[01:07:29.528 --> 01:07:31.110]  I find it interesting.
[01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:37.915]  George Will had an article in the Tribune Review on Sunday the 2nd about holding schools accountable.
[01:07:37.915 --> 01:07:41.378]  And I find it real interesting that now they want to use the name NAEP
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:48.104]  to shame schools into compliance of the federal government goals.
[01:07:48.104 --> 01:07:54.047]  And I see this as the same entity that Alex experienced last night with what he saw on the street.
[01:07:54.047 --> 01:07:59.731]  Well yeah, the feds train us how to act like animals and then get more control when the system falls apart, but they engineered it.
[01:07:59.731 --> 01:08:01.092]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:08:01.092 --> 01:08:01.712]  Yeah.
[01:08:01.712 --> 01:08:02.453]  Right.
[01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:06.956]  And they're gonna, they're gonna, the people that are trying to run outside this confusion
[01:08:07.677 --> 01:08:16.343]  uh... will be graded and then we'll have uh... the expansion of power over them and then we'll have parents like as such as the parent grading standing up.
[01:08:16.343 --> 01:08:18.364]  Yeah, they're now arresting parents in the U.S.
[01:08:18.364 --> 01:08:24.528]  if their kids don't finish the homework from Houston to Pennsylvania and uh... I mean look at this article.
[01:08:24.528 --> 01:08:25.509]  Torture for terrorists.
[01:08:25.509 --> 01:08:27.510]  Gershwin's torture could be justified.
[01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:31.412]  The globalists are giving us their worldview, their values.
[01:08:31.412 --> 01:08:35.155]  It says in the ABC News report they've got their children for torture
[01:08:35.895 --> 01:08:37.937]  And then they say, but this isn't torture.
[01:08:37.937 --> 01:08:40.498]  Torturing people's children to get them to answer questions?
[01:08:40.498 --> 01:08:42.820]  How much more evil?
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.521]  They're giving us their values, aren't they, David?
[01:08:45.547 --> 01:09:06.283]  Exactly, and the point is that when something that's remained hidden has reached the point where it wants to manifest its agenda in the world, there is always a window of time where what has remained hidden breaks the surface where we can start to see it, because they want to now bring it into everyday society reality.
[01:09:06.283 --> 01:09:14.790]  And this is why, at this point, we're now beginning to see that which has gone on underneath the surface up to this point now being put in our faces.
[01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:20.092]  This centralization of power is fundamental to the goal, for this reason.
[01:09:20.092 --> 01:09:27.816]  When there's not that many of you, compared with the global population, you have to, if you're going to control those people, centralize decision-making.
[01:09:27.816 --> 01:09:32.038]  The more points of decision-making there are, the more diversity, the less control you're going to have.
[01:09:32.038 --> 01:09:37.641]  It's like standing on a stage with loads of plates on sticks, and you've got to run around and keep them in the air.
[01:09:37.641 --> 01:09:40.262]  We've got to break.
[01:09:40.262 --> 01:09:44.324]  Come back and talk to Vance and Stan and Storm and others.
[01:09:44.969 --> 01:09:48.430]  I got some key questions coming up.
[01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:49.790]  We're on the march.
[01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:51.531]  The empire's on the run.
[01:09:51.531 --> 01:09:58.012]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:09:58.012 --> 01:10:06.294]  Do you wish you had a dollar for every... Waging war on corruption.
[01:10:06.294 --> 01:10:10.735]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:10:10.735 --> 01:10:13.776]  Rushing to the lies and disinformation.
[01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:17.853]  Battling the New World Order, Toe to Toe.
[01:10:17.853 --> 01:10:20.795]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[01:10:20.795 --> 01:10:25.599]  The government needed a crisis to convince the people to willingly give up their liberty in exchange for safety.
[01:10:25.599 --> 01:10:27.320]  Now the painful facts are in.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.844]  The dark forces of global government are funding, training, and protecting terrorist networks worldwide.
[01:10:31.844 --> 01:10:40.872]  My new book, 9-1-1 Dissent and the Tyranny, documents the ruthless history of governments orchestrating terrorist attacks against their own people to scare them into total submission.
[01:10:41.432 --> 01:10:46.474]  In this brutal expose, you will witness the birth of a global police state that surpasses Orwell's nightmare vision.
[01:10:46.474 --> 01:10:54.077]  It's all here, the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the modern implementation of peer-based control, and most frightening of all, the New World Order's future plans.
[01:10:54.077 --> 01:10:56.558]  This is one book you cannot afford to ignore.
[01:10:56.558 --> 01:10:59.819]  The future of people everywhere is at stake.
[01:10:59.819 --> 01:11:05.882]  Go to infowars.com or net to order my new book or my two films on September 11th.
[01:11:06.969 --> 01:11:08.870]  That are true to forces on the subject.

[01:11:10.451 --> 01:11:13.592]  My films are all over 2 hours long.
[01:11:13.592 --> 01:11:15.113]  $25.95 apiece.

[01:11:41.244 --> 01:11:54.854]  Or you can simply write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, LA NAR, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:11:54.854 --> 01:11:57.555]  Don't wait, start unlocking mines today.
[01:11:57.555 --> 01:12:02.479]  Everything in my books and in my films is 100% documented, no speculation.
[01:12:03.997 --> 01:12:08.144]  Going back to David Icke, David, we've got a bunch of callers here.
[01:12:08.144 --> 01:12:10.147]  You were trying to finish up a point you were just making.
[01:12:10.147 --> 01:12:19.001]  Yeah, I was just saying very quickly, what I was saying was that when there's a few trying to control the many, the points of decision making have to be centralized.
[01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:24.226]  The more decision-making goes on, the more diverse it is, the less control they have.
[01:12:24.226 --> 01:12:32.714]  And I was making the point of someone on a stage with plates spinning on lots of sticks, eventually they're going to crash because there's just too many to keep control of.
[01:12:32.714 --> 01:12:39.240]  What they want, ideally, is one big plate and one big stick, and they can stand there and keep that going indefinitely.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.602]  And this is why we've had this
[01:12:41.508 --> 01:12:44.450]  Incessant centralization of power.
[01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:51.996]  And there's another equation that the more you centralize power, the more power you have to then centralize even quicker.
[01:12:51.996 --> 01:12:56.920]  And this is why this centralization of power has got faster and faster and faster.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.342]  Well, it's a cashless society control grid.
[01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:08.785]  You know, the biometrics are going in our grocery stores to buy, the face scanning cameras, the police helicopters have been given systems that look right through our walls with a crisp image.
[01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:12.987]  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment in any canon of a free society.
[01:13:12.987 --> 01:13:24.571]  And the average person has no idea, as the physical prison is being set up now, around the prison of the mind, and they're having to do this because there is an awakening and they're losing control.
[01:13:24.571 --> 01:13:26.552]  I want to ask you a few questions, then we'll go to Vance.
[01:13:27.416 --> 01:13:30.200]  Have you seen my film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove?
[01:13:39.612 --> 01:13:41.313]  And so you saw the rituals there.
[01:13:41.313 --> 01:13:41.953]  That's real.
[01:13:41.953 --> 01:13:42.654]  The Grove admits.
[01:13:42.654 --> 01:13:43.814]  We got the footage.
[01:13:43.814 --> 01:13:46.195]  And for anybody that's doubting this, they are devil worshippers.
[01:13:46.195 --> 01:13:47.096]  This is a fact.
[01:13:47.096 --> 01:13:48.396]  You know, we're weird for reporting it.
[01:13:48.396 --> 01:13:50.597]  No, they're weird for doing it.
[01:13:50.597 --> 01:14:01.903]  I thought the blood-curdling scream at the point that they brought that, quote, effigy onto the slab under the owl and set fire to it was stunning.
[01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:17.707]  In the sense that even if that wasn't a real human being, the very fact is that they actually, these people, these people that run our world actually put that sound of that scream of agony actually on a tape as part of the ritual.
[01:14:18.562 --> 01:14:19.904]  And it begs for its life.
[01:14:19.904 --> 01:14:22.706]  The point is, it's obviously an outer ritual.
[01:14:22.706 --> 01:14:25.689]  Then we have police reports, documents, information that can't be refuted.
[01:14:25.689 --> 01:14:36.921]  And the real thing going on in a similar looking place, Redwoods and the Big Owl, going back into the 80s before the Grove was even discussed, the reason I bring the film up is that
[01:14:39.307 --> 01:14:40.830]  People will deny this stuff's going on.
[01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:43.576]  Then they see the evidence and go, oh yeah, big deal, let's move on.
[01:14:43.576 --> 01:14:49.888]  And that's a psychological defense mechanism, so people don't have a responsibility to fight this, but...
[01:14:51.385 --> 01:14:58.810]  What I want to expand out into is that, you know, you talked about Benjamin Franklin, and there's evidence he clearly was a British agent.
[01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:00.651]  They tried to control these revolutions.
[01:15:00.651 --> 01:15:02.952]  I believe a lot of it got out of their control for a while.
[01:15:02.952 --> 01:15:05.114]  That's why you had so much freedom and expansion here.
[01:15:05.114 --> 01:15:06.895]  I believe they did get back into control.
[01:15:06.895 --> 01:15:08.576]  I want to get your response to that.
[01:15:08.576 --> 01:15:10.557]  But you talk about Thomas Jefferson.
[01:15:10.557 --> 01:15:14.040]  He obviously did some damage.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.881]  You say these theaters are fighting today.
[01:15:15.881 --> 01:15:16.621]  That is going on.
[01:15:16.621 --> 01:15:17.382]  It's always going on.
[01:15:18.463 --> 01:15:20.865]  What about saying Thomas Jefferson is a bloodline?
[01:15:20.865 --> 01:15:23.207]  I mean, are you saying Thomas Jefferson was one of them, too?
[01:15:23.207 --> 01:15:25.329]  Talk about Franklin and Jefferson.
[01:15:25.329 --> 01:15:41.045]  Well, I mean, my feeling is that at least the vast majority of presidents from Washington to Bush have either been in awareness puppets, because that's what presidents are, of this manipulation,
[01:15:41.585 --> 01:15:41.886]  All right.
[01:15:56.828 --> 01:15:57.369]  I don't know.
[01:16:15.643 --> 01:16:16.063]  I think so.
[01:16:31.975 --> 01:16:37.800]  One and a half million pound grant to renovate this house as a museum to Benjamin Franklin's life.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.203]  It was in the level of when he had been there.
[01:16:41.203 --> 01:16:43.846]  Yeah, Craven Street near Trafalgar Square.
[01:16:43.846 --> 01:16:49.330]  And when they dug the floor up as part of this renovation, they found ten bodies, six of them children.
[01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:52.033]  And the newspaper articles were saying that
[01:16:53.168 --> 01:16:56.629]  Uh, that they had been dated to the time Franklin was there.
[01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:58.850]  He must have been doing a medical experiment, though, they said.
[01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:00.031]  Well, that's exactly what they said.
[01:17:00.031 --> 01:17:04.932]  They said he and his housemate must have been into body-snatching for medical research.
[01:17:04.932 --> 01:17:12.295]  But when you put together the Hellfire Club with that, it could take on, quite clearly, other possibilities.
[01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:13.536]  Well, we know he was a British agent.
[01:17:13.536 --> 01:17:14.456]  He died in England.
[01:17:14.856 --> 01:17:20.861]  Yeah, and he was also, if you look at his history, he was in London.
[01:17:20.861 --> 01:17:23.524]  He was also in Paris.
[01:17:23.524 --> 01:17:29.990]  And Paris and London are very much a dynamic duo of the Illuminati manipulation in Europe.
[01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:34.473]  Indeed, when you follow this through, you find when they left Babylon, they eventually
[01:17:35.154 --> 01:17:35.434]  I think so.
[01:17:52.939 --> 01:17:53.359]  Absolutely.
[01:17:53.359 --> 01:17:57.422]  The majority owner of the private central banks is old money and whether it's the crops,
[01:18:15.642 --> 01:18:21.588]  The British love their Royal Family, some of them do.
[01:18:21.588 --> 01:18:24.331]  They're Sachs-Coburgs.
[01:18:24.331 --> 01:18:26.413]  They're not even British, they're German.
[01:18:26.413 --> 01:18:30.477]  This is the ludicrous nature of the way people are manipulated.
[01:18:31.218 --> 01:19:00.681]  The German royal family moved in to become the British royal family, as you rightly say, the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas, and then when the British and the Germans were fighting each other in those staggeringly appalling trench warfare... The press was hanging out in Nazi Germany later, and then finally... Yeah, and the royal family thought it'd be good PR, or bad PR, to retain a German name, so that's why they changed the name from Saxe-Coburg-Gothas to Windsor.
[01:19:01.381 --> 01:19:06.084]  For no other reason than to obscure, as much as possible, the German roots.
[01:19:06.084 --> 01:19:19.932]  And people like Lord Mountbatten and other members of the royal family were very, very close and fundamentally involved with the family members in Germany who were supporting Hitler.
[01:19:19.932 --> 01:19:29.117]  And then a few Nazis got burned, but the Krumps and all the people that got the power, they own the banks, the pharmaceuticals, Ford, you know, they own it all now.
[01:19:29.917 --> 01:19:35.180]  Yeah, plus the fact that, of course, from the American expression of that, exactly the same thing was going on.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:40.804]  You had the Dulles brothers, who later became head of the CIA and Secretary of State.
[01:19:40.804 --> 01:19:48.048]  You had the Rockefellers, you had the Harrimans, and you had the Bush family also involved in the supporting of Hitler and the Nazis.
[01:19:48.048 --> 01:19:50.609]  In 1942 and 1943, they paid giant fines.
[01:19:50.609 --> 01:19:54.692]  Prescott was briefly arrested for running 53% of Nazi steel production.
[01:19:55.472 --> 01:20:01.477]  Yeah, and they were just, if you like, the American arm of the Illuminati.
[01:20:01.477 --> 01:20:07.661]  And out of these crises... And they were doing the same, supporting their German relatives who were supporting Hitler.
[01:20:07.661 --> 01:20:14.165]  I mean, the real story behind the official history is the official reality.
[01:20:14.165 --> 01:20:16.427]  And then out of this crisis, they get their world government.
[01:20:16.892 --> 01:20:19.453]  I would actually make this point, Alex, in relation to that.
[01:20:19.453 --> 01:20:19.633]  I wonder...
[01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:56.776]  ...out loud whether this apparent crisis in the UN and what Germany and Russia and France are doing is not a subplot to bring to public appreciation that the UN is not working.
[01:20:56.776 --> 01:21:03.721]  Therefore, if the UN is not working and does not have credibility, then there has to be something to replace it that has.
[01:21:04.541 --> 01:21:06.001]  What we need is a world government.
[01:21:06.001 --> 01:21:14.644]  I just wonder whether this sub-plot is actually... Well, no, I mean... David, they've already said... The question is, do you want a left-wing or a right-wing world government?
[01:21:14.644 --> 01:21:16.804]  Instead of, do you want a world government?
[01:21:16.804 --> 01:21:22.106]  They've already set that debate up, and this is also energizing the left-wing worldwide.
[01:21:22.106 --> 01:21:32.809]  You know, the general public, you feel like their ideas are good, so... It's just massive, but it turns out the UN's already got the invasion takeover administration plan for Iraq.
[01:21:32.809 --> 01:21:33.889]  It's all just smoke and mirrors.
[01:21:34.649 --> 01:21:37.992]  Plus, the people are against the war, so they've got to play along a little bit.
[01:21:37.992 --> 01:21:39.193]  Do you agree with that?
[01:21:39.193 --> 01:21:50.903]  Yeah, I mean, it's like what's happening now is there is a kind of reaction going through the UN and all that stuff to what the public is saying.
[01:21:50.903 --> 01:21:53.645]  And one of the things I said on my website, just hold on a second,
[01:21:55.026 --> 01:22:15.784]  Why is there such a large number of people in opinion polls who are against America and Britain going alone and killing thousands of Iraqi civilians, but still a majority if the UN sanction it, as if the UN is an entity that is operating independently?
[01:22:16.544 --> 01:22:18.606]  The same forces that are working through the U.N.
[01:22:18.606 --> 01:22:22.509]  are the same forces that are working through the British and American governments.
[01:22:22.509 --> 01:22:30.576]  So, in effect, whether there's another resolution or whatever is irrelevant to the fact that they intend to go and kill these civilians.
[01:22:30.576 --> 01:22:32.858]  Now, either you agree that that's right or you don't.
[01:22:32.858 --> 01:22:36.861]  It's no good saying, yes, I agree if there's a resolution, another one, but I don't if there's not.
[01:22:36.861 --> 01:22:39.783]  That's a total mind game and totally irrelevant.
[01:22:39.783 --> 01:22:41.685]  All right, we've got a bunch of calls.
[01:22:41.685 --> 01:22:42.446]  Let's go through them quick.
[01:22:42.446 --> 01:22:43.166]  Question or comment?
[01:22:43.166 --> 01:22:43.787]  We've got to move on.
[01:22:44.227 --> 01:22:48.790]  I just wanted to call and encourage you guys to get together again on Alex's show or whenever you get a chance.
[01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:52.193]  A big New World Order fighter, myself and my family.
[01:23:04.975 --> 01:23:18.836]  So I just wanted the courage to do that and then I've been on hold for like an hour so I'm kind of just trying to keep up with the subjects you're going over but as far as you were talking about a few minutes ago about how they they kind of shift their centers of power from one country to the next.
[01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:28.520]  I know David Icke is familiar with Carol Quigley because he quotes Carol Quigley all the time.
[01:23:38.406 --> 01:23:42.273]  Let me break that down real quick, just in a nutshell, and I'll let you finish up in a second, Vance.
[01:23:42.273 --> 01:23:43.475]  What you got going on here...
[01:23:54.364 --> 01:23:59.791]  California is where it all starts now, the center for the revolutionary moves here to take over, or New York.
[01:23:59.791 --> 01:24:07.521]  After they've set up their tax base, dumbed the people down, sucked them dry like vampires, they have to move on to a new area.
[01:24:07.521 --> 01:24:08.242]  David, do you agree with that?
[01:24:09.382 --> 01:24:22.591]  Yeah, I think they have moved to several headquarters, and it may well be that the move, the real center of operation may well be moved to the United States.
[01:24:22.591 --> 01:24:33.218]  But my feeling about this is that if you want someone to look in the opposite direction to where the real manipulation is being orchestrated from... Absolutely, it's definitely in Europe.
[01:24:33.218 --> 01:24:37.761]  You have to set up a foreguy, and my feeling is... This is about demonizing America!
[01:24:37.841 --> 01:24:42.866]  I'm married to an American, and I feel for Americans in so many ways for this reason.
[01:24:42.866 --> 01:24:48.511]  I think America has been set up to take the heat, to be the great Satan in the eyes of many people.
[01:24:48.511 --> 01:24:49.212]  I agree.
[01:24:49.212 --> 01:24:50.053]  And in the U.N.
[01:24:50.053 --> 01:24:53.196]  and the Euro, that's where the real power is.
[01:24:53.196 --> 01:24:54.918]  And in the Euro, plays the part of the good guy.
[01:24:54.918 --> 01:24:56.319]  Vance, you've got 20 seconds, finish up.
[01:24:57.066 --> 01:24:58.066]  Oh, that's about it.
[01:24:58.066 --> 01:25:02.787]  Just wanted to encourage you guys to get together and, uh, more often so we can listen to you.
[01:25:02.787 --> 01:25:09.829]  And, uh, yeah, I mean, I'm sure you know I just wanted to... Politics is a battle for power, a struggle for power.
[01:25:09.829 --> 01:25:21.372]  Over the course of time, one political unit gathers so much power, they're able to overwhelm the rest of the political units, eliminating... That's why the globalists try to control revolutions, thanks for the call, and create them.
[01:25:21.372 --> 01:25:23.073]  Real quick, gotta go to these calls quick now.
[01:25:23.073 --> 01:25:24.393]  Stan in Missouri, go ahead.
[01:25:27.737 --> 01:25:29.298]  All right, we'll let him go.
[01:25:29.298 --> 01:25:30.378]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:25:30.378 --> 01:25:31.338]  This is Stan.
[01:25:31.338 --> 01:25:32.599]  Okay, Stan.
[01:25:32.599 --> 01:25:33.539]  Hi, Stan.
[01:25:33.539 --> 01:25:41.622]  David, in your second book, I read that you mentioned that Hillary Clinton is a practicing witch and she belongs to a witch coven.
[01:25:41.622 --> 01:25:43.323]  How high up is she in this coven?
[01:25:44.684 --> 01:25:54.132]  Well, I can only go on what people who are involved in that kind of thing and now very reluctantly involved or have been involved in have come out.
[01:25:54.132 --> 01:25:57.695]  She's done seances publicly, Time Magazine's reported it.
[01:25:57.695 --> 01:26:06.602]  Yeah, and I think she's certainly higher from the people that have talked to me than her husband, and certainly more powerful.
[01:26:06.602 --> 01:26:09.105]  But again, if someone is
[01:26:10.351 --> 01:26:18.655]  In the public eye, who is there to be identified and targeted, they're still nowhere near the top of the hierarchy, because those people don't do that.
[01:26:18.655 --> 01:26:20.296]  They don't put themselves on public display.
[01:26:20.296 --> 01:26:20.956]  Yeah, they pose.
[01:26:20.956 --> 01:26:21.516]  Thanks, Stan.
[01:26:21.516 --> 01:26:24.077]  They pose like presidents are really our leaders.
[01:26:24.077 --> 01:26:24.898]  Thanks, Stan.
[01:26:24.898 --> 01:26:26.218]  A good question.
[01:26:26.218 --> 01:26:27.099]  Storm in Texas.
[01:26:27.099 --> 01:26:27.719]  You're on the air.
[01:26:27.719 --> 01:26:28.799]  Go ahead.
[01:26:28.799 --> 01:26:29.420]  Hello, Alex.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:30.300]  Hello, David.
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.220]  Hello, Storm.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.561]  I want to hit on two points.
[01:26:32.561 --> 01:26:34.142]  First off, reptilian genetics.
[01:26:34.142 --> 01:26:39.004]  And second, the ultimate, I believe, in the problem-reaction-solution scenario,
[01:26:39.969 --> 01:26:43.853]  The staged alien invasion, which I think is due pretty soon.
[01:26:43.853 --> 01:26:45.655]  There's an admitted government plan to do that.
[01:26:45.655 --> 01:26:48.698]  They've got the big hologram machines or Allah or Jesus.
[01:26:48.698 --> 01:26:50.139]  Whatever they want, they can project it.
[01:26:50.139 --> 01:26:50.760]  That's admitted.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.261]  David, any comments?
[01:26:52.261 --> 01:27:03.392]  I think there's a strong possibility of something like that because Henry Kissinger was reported to have said at one of the Bilderberg meetings, basically,
[01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.570]  I think.
[01:27:16.866 --> 01:27:22.990]  People were threatened or feared an invasion from outside of this earth.
[01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:31.476]  They would have no problem not only in accepting, and I'm paraphrasing here, but demanding that troops were on the streets of Los Angeles.
[01:27:31.476 --> 01:27:32.176]  Hold on, Storm.
[01:27:32.176 --> 01:27:37.239]  And we see the media playing this up and now legitimizing with the Disclosure Project and others.
[01:27:37.239 --> 01:27:37.760]  Go ahead, Storm.
[01:27:38.473 --> 01:27:40.374]  Yeah, I actually have the quote right in front of me.
[01:27:40.374 --> 01:27:45.636]  It says, Today, America will be outraged if you and your troops in Los Angeles restore order, referring to the riot.
[01:27:45.636 --> 01:27:47.937]  Tomorrow, they will be grateful, believe it or not.
[01:27:47.937 --> 01:27:54.139]  This is especially true if they were told that an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence.
[01:27:54.139 --> 01:27:54.759]  I got a break.
[01:27:54.759 --> 01:27:55.439]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:55.439 --> 01:27:55.980]  Final segment.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:56.640]  David Icke, coming up.
[01:28:00.339 --> 01:28:07.143]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk Archives, and we are listener-supported with the Honors System.
[01:28:07.143 --> 01:28:08.784]  We ask that you wait.
[01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:10.685]  Don't donate a dollar at a time.
[01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:16.248]  PayPal charges a 35-cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[01:28:16.248 --> 01:28:19.770]  Wait till you listen to five or ten, and then donate, please.
[01:28:19.770 --> 01:28:22.072]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[01:28:22.872 --> 01:28:29.418]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:28:29.418 --> 01:28:34.522]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:34.522 --> 01:28:35.603]  We know this.
[01:28:35.603 --> 01:28:36.824]  The Globalists are cunning.
[01:28:36.824 --> 01:28:37.845]  They're ruthless.
[01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:38.766]  They're totally evil.
[01:28:40.234 --> 01:28:41.736]  That is clear.
[01:28:41.736 --> 01:28:43.098]  And they must be resisted.
[01:28:43.098 --> 01:28:46.662]  We must have an awakening across the planet against the New World Order.
[01:28:46.662 --> 01:28:48.704]  We must retain our national sovereignty and our freedom.
[01:28:48.704 --> 01:28:50.506]  We must kick the globalists out.
[01:28:50.506 --> 01:28:52.669]  And to do that, it's going to take a renaissance of understanding.
[01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:55.412]  We're only going to have time to talk to John and Cliff.
[01:28:55.412 --> 01:28:56.614]  I'm sorry to the other callers.
[01:28:57.711 --> 01:29:05.615]  David, I hope that you will come back on the show because my producer walked in just now with about 50 emails.
[01:29:05.615 --> 01:29:07.215]  I never have time to get to all these questions.
[01:29:07.215 --> 01:29:08.416]  We've got a bunch of other callers.
[01:29:08.416 --> 01:29:09.656]  Will you come back on in a month or so?
[01:29:09.656 --> 01:29:10.117]  Not a problem, mate.
[01:29:10.117 --> 01:29:11.497]  It's been really, really good.
[01:29:11.497 --> 01:29:12.157]  All right.
[01:29:12.157 --> 01:29:15.559]  Real quick, how do folks get Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center disaster?
[01:29:15.999 --> 01:29:22.182]  Well, they go to the website DavidIke.com, David Ike being one word in the address, or they call 888-609-5006, 888-609-5006.
[01:29:22.182 --> 01:29:27.725]  And by the way, I'm speaking in Tyler, Texas all day on April the 12th at Sheraton Hotel.
[01:29:35.015 --> 01:29:38.717]  And again, that's in Tyler, Texas, April 8th?
[01:29:38.717 --> 01:29:39.597]  April 12th.
[01:29:39.597 --> 01:29:40.177]  April 12th, all day.
[01:29:40.177 --> 01:29:41.238]  At the Sheraton Hotel.
[01:29:41.238 --> 01:29:44.339]  Details are on the website of how to get tickets.
[01:29:44.339 --> 01:29:45.199]  All right.
[01:29:45.199 --> 01:29:50.301]  And that's going to be about 6-7 hours of taking the whole spectrum of the thing.
[01:29:50.301 --> 01:29:52.122]  Well, it takes time.
[01:29:52.122 --> 01:29:54.283]  John in Ohio, you're on the air with David Icke.
[01:29:54.283 --> 01:29:54.603]  Go ahead.
[01:29:55.103 --> 01:29:59.425]  Well, I was just trying to say a lot of things, but you mentioned about the U.N.
[01:29:59.425 --> 01:30:00.305]  bribery and blackmail.
[01:30:00.305 --> 01:30:10.108]  John Pilger, the great British journalist on ZMAG.org, pointed out that the United States has been using gangster mafia tactics to bribe, blackmail, and threaten.
[01:30:10.108 --> 01:30:13.650]  But it's not the United States, it's the globalists controlling it.
[01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:17.171]  Okay, but they've been using mafia tactics to, in effect,
[01:30:18.291 --> 01:30:25.333]  Use this charade that if people say, if you can bribe blackmail and get some of these corrupt politicians on the Security Council to go along with it.
[01:30:25.333 --> 01:30:26.734]  Yeah, they said that!
[01:30:26.734 --> 01:30:27.974]  Out in the open they're doing this.
[01:30:27.974 --> 01:30:30.015]  Do you have a question or comment for David Icke?
[01:30:30.015 --> 01:30:41.318]  Yeah, I think this occultism of the conspirators is really an attempt by them to sort of psych themselves up sociopathically for the kinds of genocide.
[01:30:41.318 --> 01:30:44.319]  Yeah, we see psychopaths always engaging in bizarre rituals.
[01:30:44.319 --> 01:30:45.020]  Thanks for the call.
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.060]  Any comments to that, David?
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:56.862]  Yeah, I think what he was saying about the bribery and corruption is something that's just coming to light here and there, but it's actually going on behind the scenes all the time.
[01:30:56.862 --> 01:31:05.965]  And the comment you made, I would like to emphasize, this is not the United States, it's not Americans, it's not the British, it's not this...
[01:31:08.045 --> 01:31:19.092]  All pervading kind of title we give to... It's hijackers controlling the mechanisms of power through large governments and populations manipulating the Grand Chess Board.
[01:31:19.092 --> 01:31:19.893]  Exactly.
[01:31:19.893 --> 01:31:25.937]  It is the same force that is working through all these apparently unconnected governments and sources of power.
[01:31:25.937 --> 01:31:27.698]  It is not America.
[01:31:27.698 --> 01:31:29.759]  It is those that control America.
[01:31:29.759 --> 01:31:32.061]  Alright, one last caller.
[01:31:32.061 --> 01:31:33.241]  Absolutely, one last caller.
[01:31:33.241 --> 01:31:34.202]  You've got 45 seconds.
[01:31:34.202 --> 01:31:35.403]  Cliff in Oklahoma, go ahead.
[01:31:35.763 --> 01:31:36.504]  Hello, Alex?
[01:31:36.504 --> 01:31:37.084]  Yes.
[01:31:37.084 --> 01:31:37.685]  Hey, how are you doing?
[01:31:37.685 --> 01:31:38.966]  I just want to say I like the show.
[01:31:38.966 --> 01:31:42.448]  I'm really glad that you'll have David Eichen on here.
[01:31:42.448 --> 01:31:54.078]  And I just want to say that, you know, regardless of our theories about the endgame, the globalists, I just want to say we've all got the same mindset about stopping them and stopping the corruption and setting up a better world.
[01:31:54.787 --> 01:31:55.367]  God bless you.
[01:31:55.367 --> 01:31:56.188]  Thanks for that call.
[01:31:56.188 --> 01:31:57.368]  That's a good final note.
[01:31:57.368 --> 01:32:02.991]  David, what will life be like under the New World Order if we don't defeat them in five years?
[01:32:02.991 --> 01:32:08.993]  Well, quite simply, I would say basically look at Nazi Germany and then expand that to the globe.
[01:32:08.993 --> 01:32:10.354]  And that's what you're looking at.
[01:32:10.354 --> 01:32:12.975]  You're looking at all areas of our lives being controlled.
[01:32:13.155 --> 01:32:15.876]  With a brave new world genetic engineering thing thrown in.
[01:32:15.876 --> 01:32:21.937]  All that stuff, microchip population, and I could say a lot about that and the nature of what the microchip's about.
[01:32:21.937 --> 01:32:31.220]  It's not just about electronic tagging, it's about mental and emotional manipulation and indeed effects on the physical body of people they want to take out.
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:36.941]  But I am so, so positive that we are looking here at a trans...
[01:32:37.501 --> 01:32:38.002]  I agree.
[01:32:38.002 --> 01:32:40.203]  We're on the march.
[01:32:40.203 --> 01:32:42.185]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:32:42.185 --> 01:32:42.945]  God bless you.
[01:32:42.945 --> 01:32:48.630]  I appreciate you and all the listeners and our affiliates and sponsors.
[01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:49.570]  David Ike, take care.
[01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:50.091]  Talk to you again.
[01:32:59.944 --> 01:33:03.369]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[01:33:03.369 --> 01:33:05.612]  We will rebroadcast this interview.
[01:33:05.612 --> 01:33:07.174]  God bless you all.
