[00:00:02.623 --> 00:00:05.865]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.150]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.891]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:18.692]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:20.153]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:21.814]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:26.236]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:28.998]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:29.898 --> 00:00:30.779]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:39.126]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:43.069]  Welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.397]  It's already the 13th of October, 2003, on this Monday, live transmission against tyranny.
[00:00:53.438 --> 00:00:58.262]  In the second and third hour, we're going to have Robert Galen Ross, who's two of the elite...
[00:00:59.261 --> 00:00:59.921]  We're good to go.
[00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:36.474]  In the first hour, we're going to have wide-open phones, and we're, of course, going to take your calls in the first, second, and third hour.
[00:01:36.974 --> 00:01:39.396]  We have another guest that's coming on the last 30 minutes of the show.
[00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:41.177]  In the third hour, they'll tell you about it a little bit later.
[00:01:42.578 --> 00:01:47.662]  Things are really heating up between Israel, Syria, and Iran.
[00:01:47.782 --> 00:01:54.967]  Israel, of course, over the weekend said, but they've already repeated several times, that they may go ahead and have a preemptive strike on Iran.
[00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:56.608]  Some are calling this a bluff.
[00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:57.229]  I don't know.
[00:01:57.964 --> 00:01:58.484]  We're good to go.
[00:01:58.524 --> 00:01:58.725]  I think?
[00:02:24.582 --> 00:02:25.222]  We're good to go.
[00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:25.382]  I think?
[00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:51.117]  It looks like they're getting ready to drop the hammer here in the next few months, next few years.
[00:02:51.197 --> 00:02:54.518]  We know what they're doing, we just don't know the exact timetable.
[00:02:54.538 --> 00:03:00.340]  I mean, we've been in this incremental march of shutting down the factories, setting up the police state, shifting into the prison economy.
[00:03:01.457 --> 00:03:03.999]  So I would ask the listeners, what do you see in the economic outlook?
[00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:14.929]  Do you think we're having a recovery as more factories shut down, as more high-tech jobs are lost, as more people declare bankruptcy and go deeper into debt, as more pension funds are raided?
[00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.851]  The stock market has actually gone up a little bit.
[00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:23.176]  It's, of course, not at 2000 or 2001 levels, but it's gone up from its low of last year.
[00:03:23.196 --> 00:03:26.759]  A lot of people are saying, oh, no, we're in a recovery.
[00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:27.039]  Is...
[00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:29.859]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:03:45.265 --> 00:03:45.405]  I think.
[00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:29.627]  Over the weekend, I did some research, some Google searches, and did find all the claims of listeners to this show Friday being confirmed.
[00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:51.012]  Not just garage door openers not working, planes having avionics problems, touchscreen doors not working, bizarre power outages, people being forced to evacuate large sections of the city, military running checkpoints outside the base under NATO control, NATO admitting they were causing the electrical disturbances.
[00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:54.114]  I found news articles backing up, not...
[00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:58.139]  Just what the caller said, but more, so we'll give you some of those developments.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:07.967]  We've got an affiliate, the Great Colorado Radio Network, right there in Colorado Springs, and it was scary what we were being told by listeners, and it turns out I found it all in news articles.
[00:05:07.987 --> 00:05:08.668]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:14.203]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:14.403 --> 00:05:18.805]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:23.347]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:05:23.387 --> 00:05:24.708]  The New World Order.
[00:05:26.532 --> 00:05:30.737]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:37.746]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:39.909]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:43.333]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:50.579]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:56.223]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:05:56.743 --> 00:05:59.386]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:06:01.147 --> 00:06:02.948]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:09.878 --> 00:06:10.599]  We're good to go.
[00:06:26.793 --> 00:06:27.293]  We're good to go.
[00:06:44.861 --> 00:06:45.161]  That's 1-800-797-3697.
[00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:46.562]  Verified quality is verified quality.
[00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:20.311]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:07:20.492 --> 00:07:28.074]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:29.075]  We're good to go.
[00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.172]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:07:48.212 --> 00:07:50.133]  The water level is always visible.
[00:07:50.293 --> 00:07:56.237]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:07:56.477 --> 00:08:00.419]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:01.019]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:15.755]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:27.485]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, we do this broadcast.
[00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:32.370]  11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.431]  We go out on the growing list of wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:47.594]  Simulcast on the internet with one of the biggest listenerships there, according to Shotcast, routinely number one, against Dr. Laurie, you name it, at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, as well as GCNLive.com.
[00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:53.436]  And we also simulcast on Global Shortwave at 12.172 and 93.20, doing a great job, and back from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:05.356]  I do have Robert Galen Ross, former NSA officer, researcher, author.
[00:09:06.235 --> 00:09:06.996]  We're good to go.
[00:09:30.317 --> 00:09:39.084]  Other good hosts that I'm proud of and I think are doing a great job, like Michael Corbin and Davin Joyce and, of course, Erskine and others.
[00:09:40.706 --> 00:09:48.192]  A lot of other hosts don't do that, but I do because these are voices that need to be heard that are putting out really important info.
[00:09:49.553 --> 00:09:56.418]  Now, before I get into the dollars sliding and what's happening with Israel saying they're going to go into Syria and Iran, which I take seriously.
[00:09:56.738 --> 00:09:57.619]  They've done it in the past.
[00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:58.660]  Others are saying it's a bluff.
[00:09:59.563 --> 00:10:09.171]  Before I do that, I do want to encourage all of the listeners to not give people junk this Christmas.
[00:10:10.212 --> 00:10:11.613]  To not buy junk.
[00:10:11.813 --> 00:10:20.060]  To not buy people fruitcakes or to not buy people mindless sundials or bird feeders that won't be used.
[00:10:22.002 --> 00:10:26.566]  Or to give Dad a $25 silk tie that he'll wear maybe once a year.
[00:10:27.677 --> 00:10:29.218]  Give the gift of reality.
[00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:32.839]  Give the gift of taking the blinders off people's eyes, unlocking their minds.
[00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:40.961]  And do, at the same time, something for this show and this broadcast and my staff as we expand our operations to fight the globalists toe-to-toe.
[00:10:42.082 --> 00:10:43.282]  I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:44.262]  I've made nine films.
[00:10:44.322 --> 00:10:45.003]  I've written a book.
[00:10:45.123 --> 00:10:47.904]  And I've published a book for Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:10:47.924 --> 00:10:55.446]  The newest thing we've put out is Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order in this 300-plus page book.
[00:10:56.309 --> 00:11:03.774]  ...is just absolutely amazing, and it's something that everybody out there must, must have.
[00:11:04.874 --> 00:11:08.717]  Now, the book gets into Israel carrying out terror to blame it on their political enemies.
[00:11:09.717 --> 00:11:14.981]  The book also gets into the British carrying out terror to blame it on their political enemies.
[00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:15.961]  It gets into the U.S.
[00:11:16.001 --> 00:11:16.722]  government doing it.
[00:11:17.162 --> 00:11:23.426]  It gets into the phony New Age UFO movement and how it is directly funded by the Rothschilds and run...
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:29.325]  Out of an office at the Sci-Fi Channel by Bill Clinton's former chief of staff.
[00:11:29.926 --> 00:11:32.268]  I mean, that's just about 10% of what's in this book.
[00:11:32.308 --> 00:11:36.432]  It has three chapters, the most up-to-date, focused, documented information on 9-11.
[00:11:38.104 --> 00:11:42.606]  It is Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and The New World Order.
[00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:43.246]  It's $19.95.
[00:11:44.586 --> 00:11:48.428]  When you order one, you get a second copy for $11.95 to give as a gift to friends or family.
[00:11:48.948 --> 00:11:51.529]  My newest film is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:11:51.929 --> 00:12:00.512]  The first 20 minutes of the two-hour, 40-minute film covers what The New World Order is and the most focused and succinct, well-documented presentation I've ever seen.
[00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:04.914]  The neocons it gets into and how they work with the left.
[00:12:05.394 --> 00:12:14.997]  It then expands out into the PNAC documents, then we get into Homeland Security, Patriot Act I and II, government-run white slavery rings, gun control.
[00:12:15.797 --> 00:12:18.297]  It gets into all of this.
[00:12:19.118 --> 00:12:23.779]  Force inoculations, the latest information on mainstream news about concentration camps.
[00:12:25.149 --> 00:12:26.390]  It is an amazing film.
[00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.050]  You need to have it.
[00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.692]  Of course, there's Road to Tyranny, which people say is my best film that unlocks the most minds.
[00:12:31.752 --> 00:12:33.233]  Part two of that, The Masters of Terror.
[00:12:33.513 --> 00:12:35.013]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:12:35.033 --> 00:12:39.695]  You want to find out where George Bush and William Bennett and Arnold Schwarzenegger go.
[00:12:39.715 --> 00:12:41.816]  You need to get that video.
[00:12:41.836 --> 00:12:43.157]  They're $25.95.
[00:12:43.297 --> 00:12:45.178]  Order three or more of the videos.
[00:12:45.218 --> 00:12:46.238]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:12:49.933 --> 00:12:51.454]  So do not wait, folks.
[00:12:51.494 --> 00:12:56.577]  Get three of the videos or more and make copies of them and give those as Christmas presents.
[00:12:56.617 --> 00:12:57.737]  Give them as birthday presents.
[00:12:57.957 --> 00:12:59.118]  Just give them to your neighbors.
[00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:13.946]  I'm not going to belabor this much longer because I want to get to the news, but last weekend, not this weekend, but last weekend, eight days ago, I was in San Francisco receiving an award from the Project Censored group with the big book they publish each year.
[00:13:14.924 --> 00:13:18.447]  And Cynthia McKinney was giving a speech about the U.N.
[00:13:18.507 --> 00:13:23.610]  white slavery rings and the New World Order and how the government's carrying out terror and how the Democrats are controlled as well.
[00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:25.291]  We've deprogrammed this liberal.
[00:13:25.592 --> 00:13:27.593]  She never talked like this until about a year and a half ago.
[00:13:28.834 --> 00:13:33.817]  A listener had called about a year and a half ago and said, I hand-delivered a copy of your film to her and she said she'd watch it.
[00:13:33.858 --> 00:13:34.918]  Then I heard from the listener again.
[00:13:34.938 --> 00:13:37.200]  They said, yeah, she said she watched it and it changed her life.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.921]  The listener said it on air.
[00:13:39.061 --> 00:13:40.062]  I didn't know if I could believe it.
[00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:42.069]  Though it sounded genuine.
[00:13:42.109 --> 00:13:46.832]  Well, Cynthia McKinney ran over, hugged me, and said, You woke me up to the New World Order.
[00:13:46.933 --> 00:13:48.093]  Your film is incredible.
[00:13:48.474 --> 00:13:49.775]  This was on videotape, by the way.
[00:13:50.575 --> 00:13:51.456]  We had a camera running.
[00:13:52.076 --> 00:13:55.419]  Cynthia McKinney running up, hugging me, and saying, You woke me up to the New World Order.
[00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:57.901]  And then you notice the Democrats and Republicans turned against her.
[00:13:58.261 --> 00:13:59.982]  My point is, I didn't do that.
[00:14:00.102 --> 00:14:00.943]  I was part of that.
[00:14:01.083 --> 00:14:07.508]  You, whoever, that caller, you in Atlanta that gave that to her, did that.
[00:14:08.386 --> 00:14:09.748]  You did that.
[00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:11.329]  You woke somebody up.
[00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:17.396]  And, you know, I'll get some congresswoman on or some legislator on.
[00:14:18.297 --> 00:14:26.606]  I remember three years ago when they almost passed a law to pull out of the union in Arizona if, quote, a New World Order is announced or gun confiscation begins.
[00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:43.205]  And I had this woman on from the legislature trying to get it passed, and she said, oh, yeah, Alex Jones, when you called to get me on, because my wife had set her up, I didn't know she had this conversation with my wife, I saw your police state 2000 that one of my constituents gave me, and it woke me up.
[00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:54.929]  I mean, folks, I found out from the manager of the Dixie Chicks here in Austin, well, I found out from a listener, and I asked their manager, they woke up to the New World Order and made their comments because they saw Road to Tyranny.
[00:14:56.352 --> 00:15:03.156]  I mean, Gary Busey called me up out of the blue and said, I saw your film, and I just was out in California and met with him about the New World Order.
[00:15:03.996 --> 00:15:06.658]  And again, that's all because of you getting the videos and making copies.
[00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:17.664]  So what if all of you get the videos to give as your Christmas gifts this year, you wake people up, you energize, you save the republic, and you support this broadcast.
[00:15:17.684 --> 00:15:19.104]  So I'm not going to go any further with this.
[00:15:19.525 --> 00:15:22.226]  Just call, get the videos, get the books, get them out to people.
[00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:23.847]  Change lives, folks.
[00:15:24.528 --> 00:15:26.229]  Cause a renaissance of understanding.
[00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:27.710]  A revelation of understanding.
[00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:30.552]  Toll-free number to get my videos.
[00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:34.855]  Operators are there right now at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:15:35.075 --> 00:15:39.277]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:15:39.878 --> 00:15:43.720]  Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.841]  You're saying, well, will this do anything?
[00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:46.822]  Will this affect change?
[00:15:46.842 --> 00:15:48.023]  Will this wake anybody up?
[00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:50.224]  What can we do to fight the New World Order?
[00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:52.866]  Well, you can tell ten people a day about the affiliates you listen to.
[00:15:53.484 --> 00:16:02.672]  Just tell them, hey, I listened to Alex on 1360, or I listened to Alex on 1260 in Austin, or I listened to Alex on, you know, in Fredericksburg on this FM channel.
[00:16:03.953 --> 00:16:04.634]  You do that.
[00:16:04.854 --> 00:16:06.636]  I listened to Alex on this station in Pennsylvania.
[00:16:06.656 --> 00:16:09.098]  I listened to Alex on this station in Albuquerque.
[00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:16.856]  I listen to Alex in Kansas City on this frequency, and you get them to tune in, and you don't have to talk yourself blue in the face.
[00:16:16.996 --> 00:16:17.456]  I'll do it.
[00:16:17.796 --> 00:16:23.021]  And I've got the website with the news articles I cover posted so they can go check out what I'm saying and find out if it's true.
[00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:25.603]  When I say something's in legislation, it's right there.
[00:16:26.204 --> 00:16:26.904]  So you do that.
[00:16:26.984 --> 00:16:27.765]  You get the videos.
[00:16:27.785 --> 00:16:28.446]  You get the books.
[00:16:28.486 --> 00:16:29.206]  You get the films.
[00:16:29.226 --> 00:16:30.147]  You get them out to people.
[00:16:30.928 --> 00:16:31.768]  Toll-free number, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:16:37.782 --> 00:16:39.763]  We're never going to beat this bully if you don't fight back.
[00:16:39.783 --> 00:16:44.106]  I mean, you can lay there and let them kick you, or you can stand up and fight and be surprised when the bully goes down.
[00:16:44.987 --> 00:16:46.067]  That's why we have America.
[00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:46.688]  That's why we had 1776.
[00:16:46.988 --> 00:16:48.749]  That's why we have freedom.
[00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:49.530]  Okay?
[00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.190]  We're defending it.
[00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.972]  And I, frankly, have got some of the best tools to deprogram people.
[00:16:52.992 --> 00:16:56.014]  1-888-253-3139, or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:17:07.537 --> 00:17:15.042]  Because over the weekend, I was thinking about how at the end of each hour for a minute or so, I'll plug my videos kind of in a haphazard fashion, and I was thinking, you know, I'm trying to defeat the new war.
[00:17:15.082 --> 00:17:16.863]  These really are the best solution we've got.
[00:17:17.103 --> 00:17:19.044]  This really is having the biggest effect I've seen.
[00:17:19.084 --> 00:17:22.427]  I mean, that's an honest... You know, I don't just say things on this show.
[00:17:22.467 --> 00:17:24.828]  I mean, it really is having an effect.
[00:17:25.729 --> 00:17:26.729]  A huge effect.
[00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.431]  All right.
[00:17:29.651 --> 00:17:31.232]  And all the glory goes to God for that.
[00:17:31.272 --> 00:17:33.094]  I just thank God for all his guidance.
[00:17:33.394 --> 00:17:33.534]  Now...
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.661]  I want to get into the economy and then Israel, because this is important.
[00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:42.083]  And maybe you want to call in and comment on this at 800-259-9231.
[00:17:42.723 --> 00:17:53.107]  There's also been some new developments in the news, admitting what callers claimed Friday on this show was going on in the Colorado Springs area when NATO took over last week.
[00:17:54.067 --> 00:17:56.448]  So we'll get into that as well before this hour ends.
[00:17:56.468 --> 00:17:57.709]  And we've got some great guests coming up.
[00:17:59.049 --> 00:18:02.091]  European buyout groups overtake U.S.
[00:18:02.391 --> 00:18:03.091]  rivals.
[00:18:04.494 --> 00:18:06.415]  This is out of the Financial Times of London.
[00:18:06.455 --> 00:18:10.396]  You want real straight-skinning on finances, go to the Financial Times of London.
[00:18:10.836 --> 00:18:14.377]  European buyout groups have for the first time overtaken their U.S.
[00:18:14.397 --> 00:18:17.977]  counterparts in their ability to raise capital from investors.
[00:18:18.658 --> 00:18:28.840]  In the first nine months of this year, European buyout houses that completed fundraising programs attracted in EU dollars $13 billion, that's $15.4 billion of U.S.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.240]  capital,
[00:18:32.168 --> 00:18:34.490]  Against $9.2 billion from U.S.
[00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:39.054]  groups, said Altel Assets Private Equity Research Group.
[00:18:39.595 --> 00:18:44.039]  The figures reverse the traditional pattern for the first nine months of 2002.
[00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:45.540]  For example, U.S.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:54.448]  groups raised $28 billion against Europe's $19.1 billion to underline a growing appetite from international investors for European buyout funds.
[00:18:55.869 --> 00:18:57.570]  Now, folks, acquisition funds.
[00:18:57.651 --> 00:18:59.152]  This had never happened before.
[00:19:00.797 --> 00:19:04.959]  In the last hundred plus years, America was the place to invest.
[00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:06.499]  America was the free economy.
[00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:09.421]  America was the sure bet.
[00:19:10.481 --> 00:19:14.343]  Now you have Russia announcing they're going to dump, taking dollars for their oil.
[00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:15.243]  They will not accept them.
[00:19:15.403 --> 00:19:16.283]  China is saying it.
[00:19:16.724 --> 00:19:18.004]  The Middle East is saying it.
[00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.025]  And what is Snow doing?
[00:19:20.585 --> 00:19:22.826]  The Treasury Secretary, but bad-mouthing the dollar.
[00:19:22.906 --> 00:19:25.547]  Bush is saying it's good to have a bad dollar for manufacturing.
[00:19:26.768 --> 00:19:27.948]  That's ridiculous, folks.
[00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.869]  And I'll explain why later.
[00:19:30.922 --> 00:19:32.243]  Because the ratios are off.
[00:19:33.363 --> 00:19:40.087]  This is by design Bush's job is to bring America down and blame it on conservatism when he's not a conservative.
[00:19:41.228 --> 00:19:42.769]  And for years I've been saying this would happen.
[00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:43.989]  And it's horrible.
[00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:55.656]  But when you tune into the pill-popping neocon shows, when you tune into these gun-grabbing shows of pure liberalism, they're not even discussing this and saying it doesn't matter.
[00:19:56.212 --> 00:20:03.097]  So I'll get into that when we get back, then straight into Israel and the escalation for World War III or IV, depending on what you want to call it.
[00:20:03.858 --> 00:20:05.779]  And we'll take your calls as well.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:06.900]  Stay with us.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:07.821]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:10.054 --> 00:20:11.035]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:11.115 --> 00:20:15.897]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:20:16.077 --> 00:20:23.882]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:20:24.142 --> 00:20:29.505]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:20:29.705 --> 00:20:36.689]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:20:36.949 --> 00:20:38.109]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:08.939]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:20.190]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:27.918]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:28.158 --> 00:21:29.459]  The system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:21:44.133 --> 00:21:48.034]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:21:48.074 --> 00:21:49.974]  The water level is always visible.
[00:21:50.154 --> 00:21:56.096]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:21:56.336 --> 00:22:00.037]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:00.057 --> 00:22:00.557]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:11.372]  We're good to go.
[00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:26.712]  We're good to go.
[00:22:41.604 --> 00:22:42.004]  We're good to go.
[00:22:42.024 --> 00:22:42.584]  We're good to go.
[00:23:09.468 --> 00:23:13.171]  Do you suffer from arthritis pain, an athletic injury, or chronic inflammation?
[00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:15.993]  If you do, you really need to try MSM.
[00:23:16.313 --> 00:23:26.381]  Clinical use has demonstrated that MSM, a natural occurring nutritional sulfur, can deliver pain relief and reduction of inflammation without the side effects that are frequently associated with prescription meds.
[00:23:26.801 --> 00:23:31.885]  MSM is not like inorganic sulfides, sulfites, or sulfates to which many people are allergic.
[00:23:32.245 --> 00:23:33.486]  There's no need to suffer the pain.
[00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:58.242]  Call 800-569-4340.
[00:23:59.723 --> 00:24:01.404]  That's 800-569-4340.
[00:24:02.505 --> 00:24:06.068]  Or visit the web at cliffscott.com.
[00:24:06.288 --> 00:24:07.949]  I use it every day and it works.
[00:24:14.835 --> 00:24:16.736]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:17.237 --> 00:24:19.959]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.762]  All right, folks, we're back live, about to go to your calls.
[00:24:25.802 --> 00:24:34.150]  Don't forget to join us on air on this live Monday edition, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:35.071]  So think about this.
[00:24:35.131 --> 00:24:40.335]  They told you back in 1994 on Larry King Live how wonderful NAFTA and GATT would be.
[00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:46.260]  They had the Republicans and the Democrats together telling America, hey, get behind NAFTA and GATT.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.922]  Don't listen to the protectionists.
[00:24:48.783 --> 00:24:50.224]  This is going to be good for you.
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.862]  I think we're good to go.
[00:25:03.996 --> 00:25:04.697]  We're good to go.
[00:25:04.717 --> 00:25:05.037]  I think?
[00:25:30.462 --> 00:25:39.184]  Now you see the EU going online a couple years ago, and where is your economy now, and where is the investment going?
[00:25:40.084 --> 00:25:41.584]  And the answer is to Europe.
[00:25:41.664 --> 00:25:47.486]  And now these countries are saying they won't even accept the dollar for oil.
[00:25:47.586 --> 00:25:55.488]  The government can't print up a bunch of greenbacks, fiat currency, from the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve owned by the private European banks.
[00:25:56.068 --> 00:25:57.368]  They can't go and buy this.
[00:25:58.228 --> 00:26:00.370]  Let's see, the European banks have sold us out.
[00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.991]  They tell the world what to accept.
[00:26:02.011 --> 00:26:03.712]  They tell the world what the value is.
[00:26:04.032 --> 00:26:05.653]  They control the currency markets.
[00:26:06.014 --> 00:26:16.761]  No, they've gone to the world now, to the third world, where the oil and the goods come from, the manufactured goods and the raw materials as well, and they've said, you will now shift to the euro.
[00:26:17.302 --> 00:26:18.642]  It is the currency of choice.
[00:26:19.583 --> 00:26:22.685]  Just a year ago, the euro was trading for 93 cents a
[00:26:24.119 --> 00:26:24.679]  We're good to go.
[00:26:24.739 --> 00:26:25.200]  We're good to go.
[00:26:49.022 --> 00:27:12.488]  This will devastate us because the Levi's plants are gone, the Haynes plants are gone, the Dell fabrication centers are gone, the Motorola's, the IBM's, the Boeing's, the Hoover vacuum cleaner companies, the companies that make the widgets, the hammers, the bolts, the nails.
[00:27:13.547 --> 00:27:14.007]  Look at it.
[00:27:14.127 --> 00:27:18.528]  Over half of what you find, more than half, in a Walmart or a Target or a Home Depot.
[00:27:18.648 --> 00:27:21.088]  China, China, China, China, China.
[00:27:21.388 --> 00:27:23.429]  I've seen another 15% say Taiwan.
[00:27:23.489 --> 00:27:26.989]  Most of that's made in China with a Taiwanese packaging label put on it.
[00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:29.750]  And I'm not trying to be gloom and doom here.
[00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:42.232]  But the same government, the same private group of raiders that aren't engaged in the free market, that are engaged in manipulation of the markets through mercantilism and modern feudalism, crony capitalism,
[00:27:43.095 --> 00:27:58.126]  Are now going to pose as your savior and put you on welfare and put you into receivership and give federal power to the Fortune 500 and put troops in the factories and give you supplemental checks on top of your paycheck so you can, quote, make it through the day.
[00:27:58.226 --> 00:27:59.187]  This is what they're talking about.
[00:27:59.487 --> 00:28:00.868]  You see, they want to control you.
[00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:02.389]  They want to make you dependent.
[00:28:02.689 --> 00:28:05.932]  They want to put you into the compact cities, the control grids.
[00:28:07.682 --> 00:28:10.385]  So my question to you is, what are you going to do?
[00:28:10.445 --> 00:28:25.539]  What should we do to counter this with the media power we've got as we hear the financial experts on Lou Dobbs' money report and read them in the financial pages of the paper telling us how good the dropping dollar is and how, if you thought NAFTA and GATT was great...
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:36.390]  Why, coming up the 18th of this month in Miami, they're going to have the Pan-American Union meeting for the free trade area of the Americas.
[00:28:36.971 --> 00:28:39.814]  And again, how did the euro start?
[00:28:40.034 --> 00:28:41.456]  25 years ago, it was a quote trade deal.
[00:28:41.476 --> 00:28:42.917]  They don't tell you we're getting rid of your sovereignty.
[00:28:42.937 --> 00:28:45.360]  They say, oh, we're just unifying some laws for trade.
[00:28:46.112 --> 00:28:48.774]  And it goes down to law enforcement and immigration.
[00:28:49.234 --> 00:28:52.056]  And NAFTA's over 14,000 pages long.
[00:28:52.896 --> 00:28:56.258]  Mexico gets to still have tariffs and control on us.
[00:28:56.879 --> 00:29:00.021]  It's all a one-way street where we have a 2% tariff on China.
[00:29:00.041 --> 00:29:02.823]  They've got a 40-plus percent average tariff on us.
[00:29:03.383 --> 00:29:09.487]  And then you're competing against millions of people in these private prisons getting an average of 20 cents an hour.
[00:29:12.176 --> 00:29:12.937]  We're good to go.
[00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:13.317]  I think?
[00:29:40.353 --> 00:29:42.154]  Right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:42.174 --> 00:29:58.086]  And if you want to read the incredible news and information that has just been posted today, you'll want to visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com as well as VirginUtah.com, JonesReport.com and InfoWars.net.
[00:29:58.306 --> 00:29:59.066]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.347 --> 00:30:01.248]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.728 --> 00:30:03.369]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.952]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:12.238]  Hey, John Statmiller here, and I have a question for you.
[00:30:12.459 --> 00:30:13.980]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.962]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[00:30:17.202 --> 00:30:19.103]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[00:30:19.363 --> 00:30:22.305]  Do you have the energy you need to do all the things in life that you need to do?
[00:30:22.605 --> 00:30:24.406]  If you're like most people, the answer is no.
[00:30:24.747 --> 00:30:28.489]  And that extra cup of coffee or an afternoon candy bar is not the solution.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.300]  We're good to go.
[00:30:45.686 --> 00:30:45.726]  866-321-1900.
[00:30:45.746 --> 00:30:49.028]  Tell them John sent you and put an end to your energy crisis with Be Alive Royal Jelly.
[00:30:49.048 --> 00:30:49.088]  866-321-1900.
[00:31:09.881 --> 00:31:10.702]  Oh, my God!
[00:31:10.962 --> 00:31:15.684]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:31:15.925 --> 00:31:19.587]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[00:31:21.167 --> 00:31:21.988]  This is Pat Cooper.
[00:31:22.028 --> 00:31:24.469]  Tony DelVecchio is coming to this station very soon.
[00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:25.070]  I'm sweet.
[00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:26.510]  I book any day now.
[00:31:26.931 --> 00:31:27.851]  You're going to love his show.
[00:31:29.532 --> 00:31:34.715]  That's all about this with your host, Tony DelVecchio, Saturday evenings from 9 to 10 p.m.
[00:31:34.755 --> 00:31:37.997]  Central Time, right here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.400]  877-996-4327
[00:32:09.898 --> 00:32:12.199]  Hi, my name is Donald from thegoldenanswer.com.
[00:32:12.519 --> 00:32:14.679]  Everyone knows that they need to own gold and silver.
[00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:16.200]  You see the headlines every day.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.880]  It's the only safe haven in these turbulent times.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.741]  Many of you want to acquire gold, but you can't afford it.
[00:32:21.881 --> 00:32:27.062]  Thegoldenanswer.com is a private club, and our members acquire gold at 40 cents on the dollar.
[00:32:27.262 --> 00:32:29.223]  That's right, just 40 cents on the dollar.
[00:32:29.543 --> 00:32:33.187]  The balance is paid off by getting five other people into the club and to open a contract.
[00:32:50.382 --> 00:32:51.583]  We are the answer.
[00:32:51.763 --> 00:32:56.624]  The golden answer to securing your future in gold and silver bullion at 40 cents on the dollar.
[00:32:56.764 --> 00:33:00.746]  For more information, visit us at thegoldenanswer.com or give us a call at 1-800-710-1090.
[00:33:00.766 --> 00:33:00.986]  That's 1-800-710-1090.
[00:33:12.896 --> 00:33:18.921]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:22.564]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:25.266 --> 00:33:28.588]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, we do the show live.
[00:33:28.628 --> 00:33:30.970]  Of course, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.472]  We're about to go to Jeff and Rob and many others that are holding.
[00:33:33.952 --> 00:33:36.054]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:36.094 --> 00:33:36.434]  And it is now...
[00:33:43.695 --> 00:33:46.557]  About 34 minutes into the hour, into this first hour.
[00:33:46.577 --> 00:33:50.061]  We do have a couple great guests coming up in the next hour, so definitely stay with us.
[00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:59.490]  Robert Galen Ross, who's who of the elite and the elite serial killers of RFK, JFK, and MLK with the talk show host Erskine riding shotgun with us.
[00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.072]  So that's in the second and third hour with your calls as well.
[00:34:02.092 --> 00:34:03.394]  We're about to go to your calls right now.
[00:34:03.854 --> 00:34:04.535]  Then coming up...
[00:34:05.055 --> 00:34:08.338]  Iran airstrike plan seen as bluff, Washington Times.
[00:34:08.418 --> 00:34:09.018]  I don't buy that.
[00:34:09.158 --> 00:34:14.663]  Israel preemptively attacked in, what, 1981, the TAMUS nuclear reactor in Iraq.
[00:34:15.483 --> 00:34:16.044]  We'll get into that.
[00:34:16.164 --> 00:34:19.306]  Also, did e-vote firm patch election?
[00:34:19.326 --> 00:34:20.387]  This is out of Wired News.
[00:34:20.747 --> 00:34:22.689]  Moron Diebold manipulating elections.
[00:34:23.509 --> 00:34:26.652]  And Moscow prepared to stage preemptive strikes as well.
[00:34:26.752 --> 00:34:33.517]  So Washington's preemptive stance now has got North Korea, China, Russia all saying they'll do the same thing, as well as India.
[00:34:34.716 --> 00:34:35.196]  It doesn't matter.
[00:34:35.216 --> 00:34:39.859]  The military-industrial complex is more than happy during this escalated climate to sell weapons to everyone.
[00:34:40.799 --> 00:34:48.903]  Again, we'll get into more of Israel's plans for attack on Iran, as well as Syria, and now Time Magazine putting out propaganda about Saddam's Syrian stash.
[00:34:49.284 --> 00:34:55.307]  Investigators think they found some of Hussein's loot and is the money-funding terrorist attacks.
[00:34:55.567 --> 00:35:03.071]  So Time Magazine tells Bush's lies, then they come out and admit Bush is a liar and act like they've got credibility and tell new lies for old.
[00:35:03.795 --> 00:35:04.735]  So we'll get into some of that.
[00:35:04.835 --> 00:35:09.616]  An attack on Syria approved by Washington warmongers by Gordon Thomas of American Free Press.
[00:35:10.297 --> 00:35:13.637]  RFID moves into public library with the small tracker chips.
[00:35:14.638 --> 00:35:19.939]  Also, self-administered vaccine on Walmart shelves and the propaganda campaign to promote it.
[00:35:20.939 --> 00:35:26.361]  We'll get into military vaccine problems mount out of CBS News.
[00:35:27.061 --> 00:35:30.122]  Colorado Daily reports tiny robots in the trees.
[00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:31.802]  Yes, DARPA...
[00:35:32.896 --> 00:35:37.259]  DARPA just doesn't want to bet on dead soldiers or have blimps tethered watching you at all times.
[00:35:37.279 --> 00:35:38.440]  They've already launched drones.
[00:35:39.561 --> 00:35:45.004]  They don't just want ground penetrating radar on federalized local police helicopters scanning your homes.
[00:35:46.005 --> 00:35:50.688]  Now they're going to make sure you're not out in the wilded areas off tiny robots watching you.
[00:35:50.768 --> 00:35:51.929]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[00:35:52.489 --> 00:35:54.871]  China confirms launch date for space trip.
[00:35:54.891 --> 00:35:56.452]  Another technology news.
[00:35:57.553 --> 00:35:58.914]  And the Germans are real excited.
[00:35:58.934 --> 00:36:00.615]  They think Arnold's going to make a great president.
[00:36:00.655 --> 00:36:01.896]  Yes, that's a Reuters story.
[00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:03.687]  That's all coming up.
[00:36:03.747 --> 00:36:05.368]  Right now, let's go to Jeff in Illinois.
[00:36:05.728 --> 00:36:06.949]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:36:07.049 --> 00:36:07.429]  Welcome.
[00:36:07.689 --> 00:36:13.471]  Alex, if you ever need a guest host, I'd love to sit in because the more I educate myself on this, you know, it's just incredible.
[00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:19.754]  The greatest news, Alex, that we can say is about 80% of these people, if they were educated, would be for us.
[00:36:20.647 --> 00:36:21.287]  Well, that's it.
[00:36:21.307 --> 00:36:26.630]  We can just sit down, show somebody history, what governments have done, and then show them what's happening today.
[00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:28.170]  We don't have to tell them what's going on.
[00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.631]  They'll figure it out for themselves.
[00:36:30.071 --> 00:36:30.551]  Exactly.
[00:36:30.592 --> 00:36:33.713]  You know, I mean, I'm having some problem with the local sheriff.
[00:36:34.413 --> 00:36:40.876]  And, you know, if you guys could mail in the police state 2000, I wish I had some money to buy something, but they pretty much laid siege to us over the last three years.
[00:36:40.936 --> 00:36:42.637]  And I ran for sheriff in St.
[00:36:42.657 --> 00:36:44.538]  Francis County, Missouri in the year 2000.
[00:36:44.778 --> 00:36:47.539]  I have no doubt that the election was stolen from us, you know, and
[00:36:48.432 --> 00:36:49.193]  Because we smoked him.
[00:36:49.433 --> 00:36:54.418]  He went from having 4,800 people in the primary in August.
[00:36:54.458 --> 00:36:55.158]  He had 4,200 votes.
[00:36:55.198 --> 00:36:59.843]  And then in November, he supposedly came up with 13,454.
[00:36:59.883 --> 00:37:03.166]  35% of his own party voted against him.
[00:37:03.186 --> 00:37:04.887]  Well, we've got a lot of election fraud news.
[00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:05.628]  It's confirmed.
[00:37:05.648 --> 00:37:07.690]  What else is on your mind, sir?
[00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.252]  Well, just keep it up.
[00:37:10.552 --> 00:37:11.653]  We're doing what we can.
[00:37:13.035 --> 00:37:14.276]  Just educate the people.
[00:37:14.317 --> 00:37:18.001]  If you could mail some stuff to the sheriff in Steelville, Missouri.
[00:37:18.021 --> 00:37:19.082]  Sir, I can't do anything more.
[00:37:19.142 --> 00:37:21.485]  I'm working conservatively 16 hours a day.
[00:37:21.625 --> 00:37:24.769]  Well, if you need help then, Alex, I'd love to be able to do whatever I can.
[00:37:24.969 --> 00:37:27.692]  Well, no, it's just I can't mail everybody in the country videos.
[00:37:27.932 --> 00:37:31.777]  I say folks can make copies of them, and that's more than anybody else does.
[00:37:31.857 --> 00:37:33.779]  So you do release the copyright then?
[00:37:34.682 --> 00:37:41.346]  Well, what I've said is that for non-profit, not for sale purposes, if you want to make a thousand copies and hand them out to people, please do it.
[00:37:41.627 --> 00:37:42.127]  Hallelujah.
[00:37:42.147 --> 00:37:43.108]  We'll find some money for you.
[00:37:43.528 --> 00:37:44.008]  All right.
[00:37:44.348 --> 00:37:44.709]  Thank you.
[00:37:45.549 --> 00:37:46.870]  That's force multiplication.
[00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.471]  Thanks for the call.
[00:37:48.491 --> 00:37:48.991]  God bless you.
[00:37:49.292 --> 00:37:49.832]  Thanks, Jeff.
[00:37:50.632 --> 00:37:52.894]  What do special forces do?
[00:37:54.716 --> 00:38:10.426]  You parachute them in with logistics and base materials, but mainly their minds, behind enemy lines, and they go into the oppressed indigenous population, and they mobilize them to defeat the enemy, whether in information war and then physically if need be.
[00:38:11.227 --> 00:38:18.872]  But generally, most of what Special Forces does is deprogram people and then show them how to fight and motivate them.
[00:38:19.412 --> 00:38:24.135]  And so what I do is I produce the documentary films, and I tell you, get them and make copies of them.
[00:38:24.713 --> 00:38:32.559]  And when you then get them and make copies of them, you can then force multiply that and turn thousands of tapes that go out into tens of millions of tapes.
[00:38:32.759 --> 00:38:34.841]  And that has happened, so we've got to keep that going.
[00:38:35.401 --> 00:38:36.822]  Let's talk to Rob in Wyoming.
[00:38:36.882 --> 00:38:37.623]  Rob, you're on the air.
[00:38:37.663 --> 00:38:38.083]  Go ahead.
[00:38:39.985 --> 00:38:42.687]  Yeah, I've finally been able to copy.
[00:38:43.327 --> 00:38:44.488]  It's time-consuming.
[00:38:44.528 --> 00:38:46.210]  It's in real time, you know, but copy...
[00:38:47.585 --> 00:38:48.466]  I've been copying.
[00:38:49.106 --> 00:38:52.448]  I wish I could copy more, but I'm trying to figure out how to present them to people.
[00:38:52.488 --> 00:38:57.651]  I'm going to call you back here in a few weeks and have a report on one of them.
[00:38:58.311 --> 00:39:00.352]  One of them I talked to was a reporter.
[00:39:00.372 --> 00:39:03.114]  This gets into what caused me to call her.
[00:39:04.034 --> 00:39:05.715]  She expressed interest.
[00:39:05.775 --> 00:39:07.096]  She listened to what I had to say.
[00:39:07.356 --> 00:39:08.757]  We talked for 45 minutes.
[00:39:09.377 --> 00:39:11.358]  I told her I'd bring her these tapes.
[00:39:11.738 --> 00:39:12.659]  What I did was copy...
[00:39:14.172 --> 00:39:20.875]  The Masters of Terror, to me, is the most attention-grabbing and indisputable.
[00:39:22.235 --> 00:39:31.698]  Also, Police State 2000, The Takeover, because I didn't get the first one, but the second one's got plenty of actual photographic images and proof of the black bloc.
[00:39:31.738 --> 00:39:33.219]  I mean, right up close and personal.
[00:39:33.857 --> 00:39:39.200]  You know, where that one stormtrooper's heading down the street spraying people, I don't know with what exactly.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.722]  Old ladies for no reason, and they say, I'm about to have an anti-WTO pin in the city.
[00:39:44.023 --> 00:39:45.123]  Exactly, and he stops.
[00:39:45.804 --> 00:39:53.728]  The stormtrooper stops with all the others, turns around, and sprays a guy that's just standing there on the tape.
[00:39:54.608 --> 00:39:57.429]  Well, we've got video of them stomping old women for no reason.
[00:39:57.749 --> 00:39:58.309]  Oh, yeah.
[00:39:58.449 --> 00:39:59.229]  Oh, yeah, totally.
[00:39:59.609 --> 00:40:10.651]  That was in Seattle, and we show how they hired 50 thugs, Delta Force controlled them, they went out and burned trash cans, they show it on the news, then attacked the peaceful protesters and put them in a FEMA camp.
[00:40:10.671 --> 00:40:11.771]  We have all the video of that.
[00:40:12.051 --> 00:40:21.293]  Well, see, people, I don't think people can relate as well when they read it as text only, but when they actually see the images, you know, some of which are very hard to stomach.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:22.780]  Then they realize.
[00:40:23.601 --> 00:40:24.681]  But you had been taught.
[00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:26.782]  Let me tell you why I called her to begin with.
[00:40:26.822 --> 00:40:27.762]  This will be my first one.
[00:40:27.782 --> 00:40:28.602]  I've already made the tapes.
[00:40:28.622 --> 00:40:29.622]  I'm going to give them to them today.
[00:40:32.663 --> 00:40:35.604]  I had called because on their news show, you know, at 10 p.m.
[00:40:35.664 --> 00:40:38.645]  or whatever, they had a little segment on domestic terrorists.
[00:40:39.446 --> 00:40:43.887]  Now, never is the main suspect even on the suspect list at all.
[00:40:45.136 --> 00:40:59.420]  For domestic terrorism, that being the intelligence agencies and the ones that have the ability to get it done, they're in a position to get it done, to say nothing of the motive to get it done and the history of complete criminal, blatant criminal activity.
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.541]  I mean, they truly would lie when the truth would sound better.
[00:41:05.141 --> 00:41:11.484]  And so they have, you know, the usual list from the Phoenix Memo, constitutionalist types.
[00:41:11.724 --> 00:41:16.906]  Well, here's what he said was, people who disagree with the current administration's policies.
[00:41:17.546 --> 00:41:21.868]  So you're watching a local, let me stop, you're watching a local news show in Wyoming.
[00:41:22.615 --> 00:41:27.518]  And they say, constitutionalists, those that disagree with the administration, they're saying these are terrorists.
[00:41:27.679 --> 00:41:28.479]  Right.
[00:41:28.659 --> 00:41:31.681]  I kind of accidentally put two together there.
[00:41:31.741 --> 00:41:35.724]  They said the latter part, those that disagree with the current administration's policies.
[00:41:36.745 --> 00:41:40.367]  And nobody raised an eyebrow on the local news team.
[00:41:40.787 --> 00:41:42.028]  It's like on to the sports.
[00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:43.249]  So I called in.
[00:41:43.289 --> 00:41:50.134]  Now, I first called in and had to leave a message, several messages, with the station director of news and also...
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.882]  Okay, so what happened?
[00:41:55.183 --> 00:42:11.014]  So anyway, it reminded me of an FBI minion being interviewed on CNN back in February who said that we strongly support Israel and we know there are people out there who disagree with our approach to Israel.
[00:42:11.801 --> 00:42:16.068]  And that's another, you know, where we can expect the ranks of future terrorists to emerge.
[00:42:16.489 --> 00:42:21.558]  I find that so... Well, for those that are tuning in for the first time, I mean, in the road to tyranny,
[00:42:22.509 --> 00:42:31.114]  I have FEMA in Kansas City and a group of police officers and a firefighter shot the video for me saying, quote, the Founding Fathers are terrorists, all Christians are terrorists.
[00:42:31.474 --> 00:42:35.496]  Then I have the training manual where it says Constitutionalists, Defenders of America.
[00:42:36.036 --> 00:42:38.938]  I've got other training manuals where it says homeschoolers, gun owners.
[00:42:39.258 --> 00:42:42.900]  I mean, for those that don't know, all over the country, from Austin to Kansas City to New York,
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:48.786]  They're teaching the police that anyone that loves America, anyone that loves the Second Amendment, period, is a terrorist.
[00:42:48.826 --> 00:42:51.249]  Now, they are the terrorists for teaching that.
[00:42:51.329 --> 00:42:52.551]  That's bizarro.
[00:42:52.831 --> 00:42:54.733]  That's totally un-American.
[00:42:54.813 --> 00:42:57.436]  But this is going on behind the scenes.
[00:42:57.556 --> 00:43:01.401]  Now, and yes, I've seen it, there are all these local newscasts where it will mention.
[00:43:02.221 --> 00:43:04.663]  That those that are against the administration are terrorists.
[00:43:04.723 --> 00:43:09.787]  Now, folks, that shows you the blatant tyranny they're attempting to bring forward.
[00:43:10.107 --> 00:43:13.089]  I mean, Bush has got a 43% approval rating right now.
[00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:19.634]  Does that mean that 57% of the country are terrorists?
[00:43:20.214 --> 00:43:26.959]  Well, it's just like when lawyers tell juries, which is jury tampering, check your common sense at the door.
[00:43:28.178 --> 00:43:33.741]  That's the final victory of control, is to get you to sell out your own common horse sense.
[00:43:33.982 --> 00:43:36.683]  Yeah, they tell you, you rule as the judge tells you to rule.
[00:43:36.883 --> 00:43:38.424]  Folks, that's not how America works.
[00:43:38.444 --> 00:43:39.585]  That's not how the juries work.
[00:43:40.105 --> 00:43:44.868]  I mean, take the American Bar Association this year, saying no more attorney-con privilege.
[00:43:45.068 --> 00:43:51.932]  Well, look what Clarence Bremmer had to say about juries in Sunday's Casper Star Tribune here in Wyoming.
[00:43:52.412 --> 00:43:52.753]  He said...
[00:43:53.553 --> 00:43:54.494]  He's talking about the juries.
[00:43:54.534 --> 00:43:57.437]  He says most jurors have done what they're supposed to do.
[00:43:57.757 --> 00:43:58.558]  And then here's a quote.
[00:43:58.618 --> 00:44:06.485]  Of course I work on telling them what to do and when to do it, Clarence Bremer said.
[00:44:07.206 --> 00:44:08.187]  And this is a judge?
[00:44:08.207 --> 00:44:09.208]  It's a stunning admission.
[00:44:09.228 --> 00:44:09.468]  Yeah.
[00:44:09.929 --> 00:44:10.849]  Yeah, right in the newspaper.
[00:44:10.869 --> 00:44:12.611]  Do you have access to a computer to email me that?
[00:44:16.937 --> 00:44:19.019]  Yeah, that's why one reason I call your show is to listen.
[00:44:19.059 --> 00:44:21.220]  I'm off the internet now, so I can't hear it normally.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.261]  Well, I hope somebody will email that.
[00:44:22.281 --> 00:44:23.362]  Yeah, I'll get it to you somehow.
[00:44:23.382 --> 00:44:26.384]  Somebody will email that to tips at infowars.com so we can post it.
[00:44:26.624 --> 00:44:27.524]  Cool, I'll get it to you.
[00:44:27.544 --> 00:44:29.126]  Okay, tips at infowars.com.
[00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:29.966]  Yes, thanks for the call.
[00:44:30.326 --> 00:44:30.907]  Appreciate it.
[00:44:31.427 --> 00:44:32.608]  I really do appreciate that call.
[00:44:32.668 --> 00:44:46.217]  Yeah, I mean, these callers are kind of bringing up different issues, but folks, do you realize how bizarre it is to have episodes of Frasier where they all tell him, don't join the gun club, they're terrorists, and in the end it turns out the gun club are terrorists.
[00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:57.821]  To have episodes of saving or judging Amy where the CPS grabs all the homeschoolers' kids every episode.
[00:44:58.461 --> 00:45:00.802]  Or to turn on the show Threat Matrix.
[00:45:00.882 --> 00:45:08.444]  Every episode they're torturing someone, arresting people for dealing drugs under terrorism, and they don't get juries or to face their accusers, and their children are taken.
[00:45:09.444 --> 00:45:12.525]  Or it's just the propaganda is everywhere.
[00:45:14.914 --> 00:45:20.319]  It's like what television was like in the movie The Running Man or 1984.
[00:45:20.539 --> 00:45:27.204]  You know, these horrible dystopic movies and books and ideas of a nightmare future.
[00:45:27.504 --> 00:45:28.245]  Here it is.
[00:45:28.305 --> 00:45:31.327]  They're trying to sell us this propaganda.
[00:45:31.367 --> 00:45:32.889]  Now, why is it so overt now?
[00:45:32.929 --> 00:45:33.689]  Because they're desperate.
[00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:35.731]  They're losing control now.
[00:45:36.772 --> 00:45:37.252]  Big time.
[00:45:38.314 --> 00:45:44.998]  Before I go back to other calls, and maybe somebody wants to call in about the plunging dollar or World War III with Israel saying they're going to go into all these countries.
[00:45:45.478 --> 00:45:47.079]  I mean, does that concern anybody?
[00:45:47.099 --> 00:45:47.159]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:53.884]  Iran airstrike plan seen as bluff.
[00:45:54.044 --> 00:45:55.505]  Now, that's the Washington Times headline.
[00:45:55.605 --> 00:45:56.505]  I don't agree with that.
[00:45:56.946 --> 00:46:10.214]  Reports that Israel is preparing to preempt airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and is now able to fire nuclear missiles from submarines were seen as reflecting deep anxiety in Israel for Tehran's nuclear program.
[00:46:11.795 --> 00:46:16.338]  I've come walking out of a hamburger joint last night with my wife...
[00:46:17.304 --> 00:46:20.205]  We're going to go hear some classical music at Zilker Park.
[00:46:20.465 --> 00:46:22.445]  They play music in the park, a band out there.
[00:46:22.485 --> 00:46:29.067]  And we came walking out of the hamburger place with our food, and I see the newsstands.
[00:46:29.127 --> 00:46:32.068]  I didn't even buy the article, but it was the paper.
[00:46:32.088 --> 00:46:33.048]  It was the Houston Chronicle.
[00:46:33.088 --> 00:46:36.809]  I sat there and read it for a second, and it was, Israel now has nukes.
[00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:42.831]  Israel has had nuclear weapons...
[00:46:44.341 --> 00:46:44.721]  We're good to go.
[00:47:00.107 --> 00:47:04.751]  And I heard people on talk radio when I was driving home last night, did you know Israel has nukes?
[00:47:04.891 --> 00:47:06.352]  Wow, I didn't know that.
[00:47:06.472 --> 00:47:12.017]  I mean, it's like saying, did you know that there's an obelisk at the Washington Mall?
[00:47:12.337 --> 00:47:14.479]  Did you know the sun came up this morning?
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:19.163]  But oh, major news report, here it is in the Washington Times.
[00:47:19.803 --> 00:47:21.705]  Now that Israel says they have nukes.
[00:47:22.953 --> 00:47:32.676]  Israel's newspaper said officials appear to have linked the reports in an attempt to focus the attention of the international community on the dangers of Iranian nuclear weapons development.
[00:47:33.876 --> 00:47:39.118]  Well, Israel's not a signatory to the nonproliferation treaty, and neither is Iran.
[00:47:40.798 --> 00:47:46.600]  And by the way, U.S., British, and Israeli companies have been arming Iran along with Chinese companies.
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:50.141]  So they're now announcing they've got nukes, folks.
[00:47:51.952 --> 00:47:55.094]  And I want to announce that the automobile was just invented, too.
[00:47:55.814 --> 00:47:57.895]  And so was the toothbrush, just yesterday.
[00:47:57.955 --> 00:47:59.976]  They've now announced a new thing called a toothbrush.
[00:48:00.076 --> 00:48:02.077]  And, by the way, Israel just got nuked.
[00:48:03.078 --> 00:48:03.818]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:48:04.298 --> 00:48:08.340]  Did E-Vote Firm Patch Election?
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.601]  Now, that's the Wired News headline.
[00:48:11.402 --> 00:48:13.723]  Now, this is, of course, a total whitewash, but it's bad enough.
[00:48:14.363 --> 00:48:19.466]  Diebold Election Systems has had a tumultuous year, and it doesn't look like it's getting any better.
[00:48:20.306 --> 00:48:21.187]  Last January, the...
[00:48:22.276 --> 00:48:35.543]  Electronic voting machine maker faced public embarrassment when voting activists revealed the company's insecure FTP server was making its software source code available for everyone to see.
[00:48:36.223 --> 00:48:48.369]  Then researchers and auditors who examined code for the company's touchscreen voting activities revealed the company's infrastructure for FTP server was making its software source code available for everyone to see.
[00:48:49.702 --> 00:48:59.894]  Then researchers and auditors who examined code for the company's touchscreen voting system released two separate reports stating that the software was full of serious security flaws.
[00:49:00.254 --> 00:49:03.558]  You mean wireless internet connections built in that no one was told about.
[00:49:04.099 --> 00:49:06.842]  Now a former worker in Diebold's Georgia warehouse...
[00:49:07.714 --> 00:49:19.786]  Says the company installed patches on its machines before the state's 2002 gubernatorial election that were never certified by independent testing authorities or cleared by Georgia's election officials.
[00:49:20.106 --> 00:49:27.553]  Folks, in San Mato, California, Dybul was caught going through the back door of the system manipulating votes during an election, which you're not even supposed to do.
[00:49:29.142 --> 00:49:34.147]  If the charges are true, Diebold could be in violation of federal and state election certification rules.
[00:49:34.167 --> 00:49:43.598]  The charges also raise questions about the integrity of the Georgia election results and any other election that uses patched Diebold systems that have not been recertified.
[00:49:44.278 --> 00:49:49.103]  Again, the Fox certifies 15 weasels to guard the hen house at 3 a.m.
[00:49:49.123 --> 00:49:49.564]  in the morning.
[00:49:50.851 --> 00:50:00.279]  According to Rob Baylor, an engineer hired as a contractor to work in Diebold's Georgia warehouse last year, the Diebold systems had major functioning problems.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.100]  Problems?
[00:50:01.861 --> 00:50:07.486]  I mean, the head of Diebold said in an internal letter, I will deliver the votes to the Republican Party.
[00:50:07.686 --> 00:50:12.951]  According to the mainstream news articles that have been out in the Plain Dealer and Cincinnati and other publications.
[00:50:14.278 --> 00:50:15.560]  And he said, And he said,
[00:50:32.882 --> 00:50:34.283]  And folks, it's a four-page article.
[00:50:34.303 --> 00:50:35.204]  I've read half a page.
[00:50:35.224 --> 00:50:39.406]  It's just dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens.
[00:50:39.787 --> 00:50:46.971]  Then there's the secret meeting with Diebold and the people heading up the other two electronic voting machine companies, former deputy directors of the CIA.
[00:50:47.692 --> 00:50:56.117]  They're in a classified telephone conference that the Plain Dealer Reporter got into with Bev Harris, and they're bragging, yes, we've got to keep the people in the dark about this.
[00:50:56.157 --> 00:50:57.898]  This could be called racketeering, what we're doing.
[00:50:57.938 --> 00:50:58.679]  No one can know.
[00:50:59.519 --> 00:51:00.780]  This is in the newspaper.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.241]  It's not national news, though.
[00:51:02.987 --> 00:51:07.086]  We'll come back, take more calls, and then get into all this other bizarro news.
[00:51:07.106 --> 00:51:07.769]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:14.433]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:51:14.673 --> 00:51:20.118]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:51:20.378 --> 00:51:30.746]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:51:30.926 --> 00:51:35.250]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:43.896]  And volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:51:44.076 --> 00:51:50.441]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:51:50.561 --> 00:51:55.044]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:51:55.264 --> 00:51:59.467]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:51:59.728 --> 00:52:04.091]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888
[00:52:04.531 --> 00:52:05.192]  We're good to go.
[00:52:29.872 --> 00:52:30.292]  We're good to go.
[00:52:46.425 --> 00:52:48.526]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:53:14.674 --> 00:53:15.974]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:53:16.174 --> 00:53:21.916]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:53:22.196 --> 00:53:27.458]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:53:27.738 --> 00:53:31.839]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:53:32.179 --> 00:53:32.840]  We're good to go.
[00:53:49.441 --> 00:53:51.523]  Order 911 The Road to Terry today.

[00:53:55.967 --> 00:53:57.249]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:53:57.489 --> 00:54:03.134]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[00:54:03.254 --> 00:54:05.276]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:54:05.476 --> 00:54:07.018]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:54:07.178 --> 00:54:09.240]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:54:28.297 --> 00:54:43.843]  All right, folks, we're back live, and I want to go to Clyde and Jim and Steve and a bunch of other people that are patiently holding, but continuing just with one more paragraph out of this lengthy Wired News magazine report about electronic voting fraud.
[00:54:44.843 --> 00:54:52.266]  It goes on, Harris has spent a year investigating problems with electronic voting systems and is the author of a forthcoming book on the technology.
[00:54:52.706 --> 00:54:55.767]  She said the practice of patching systems after they've been certified...
[00:54:58.205 --> 00:55:10.510]  And that's, of course, companies have been caught doing that.
[00:55:11.071 --> 00:55:21.835]  According to Harris, the scenarios particularly worrisome in light of what happened in Georgia gubernatorial race, which ended in a major upset that defied the polls and put a Republican in the governor's seat for the first time in more than 130 years.
[00:55:24.068 --> 00:55:26.830]  And again, the Democrats will use this too once they're in power.
[00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:29.211]  These are mechanisms of tyranny.
[00:55:29.251 --> 00:55:35.494]  Republican candidate Sonny Perdue managed to unseat Democratic incumbent Roy Barnes with only 51% of the vote.
[00:55:36.095 --> 00:55:42.478]  It was the first time an incumbent governor had not won his second term since Georgia law allowed back-to-back terms in 1978.
[00:55:42.698 --> 00:55:46.740]  And it just goes, and this is all a whitewash, folks.
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.442]  The stuff in this article is nothing compared to what's really going on.
[00:55:50.733 --> 00:55:52.213]  So more on that coming up.
[00:55:52.293 --> 00:55:54.134]  Right now, let's go to Clyde in Colorado.
[00:55:54.154 --> 00:55:54.934]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:55:54.954 --> 00:55:55.374]  Go ahead.
[00:55:56.414 --> 00:56:01.695]  Alex, have you had anybody on that has gone into what is called psycholinguistics?
[00:56:03.896 --> 00:56:06.896]  Why don't you familiarize people with what you're talking about?
[00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:14.078]  Well, basically, it's the use of the language in such a controlled manner that
[00:56:14.884 --> 00:56:20.387]  In order to deceive or in order to ultimately control human behavior.
[00:56:20.667 --> 00:56:32.674]  That's what 1984 is really about with the 11th edition of Ingsoc is Winston trying to describe how they were using words to destroy the thinking process and removing words and changing the meaning of words.
[00:56:36.696 --> 00:56:37.956]  And that's what's going on now.
[00:56:39.257 --> 00:56:44.340]  Well, I think there is a guy, I attended a program about four years ago, there's a
[00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:59.080]  The guy who spent the last 15 or 20 years studying what's going on, he first started studying social psychology, how initially it was used in order to control people's social attitudes, social mores, and that sort of thing.
[00:56:59.961 --> 00:57:12.971]  Then he got into looking in the last 30 years into how social psychologists essentially took their takeoff on modern principles of psychology and merged the two together
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:24.964]  And they came up with what is social psychological linguistics, the merging of psychological principles with sociological principles with linguistics.
[00:57:25.004 --> 00:57:28.845]  Yeah, I mean, really, it's just mass manipulation and high-tech propaganda systems.
[00:57:29.425 --> 00:57:40.829]  You know, what I found in dealing with people and discussing any of these issues, even trying to get them to watch a video, what I have found is that there's just a, it's almost like,
[00:57:41.775 --> 00:57:45.917]  They're surrounded by some kind of a forest field.
[00:57:46.357 --> 00:57:48.278]  I don't know what it is.
[00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:55.720]  See, all I've found is people waking up in mass, and maybe it's my delivery style, but you know what?
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:58:00.822]  When people get hurt, when people get squeezed by the system, they're going to wake up, Clyde.
[00:58:00.882 --> 00:58:04.544]  And it's important that we plant the seeds beforehand.
[00:58:04.664 --> 00:58:05.164]  Absolutely.
[00:58:05.284 --> 00:58:08.926]  And so later when it happens, just as we said it would, they will then wake up.
[00:58:09.426 --> 00:58:09.686]  Mm-hmm.
[00:58:10.697 --> 00:58:18.221]  Well, this fellow, I think he lives in western Kansas, and I believe I'll try to email you his name and information and some background on him.
[00:58:19.161 --> 00:58:25.904]  He has a profound understanding, you know, going into what we call deconstructionism.
[00:58:25.964 --> 00:58:27.565]  You're familiar with what that is also.
[00:58:27.585 --> 00:58:37.510]  These are just different ways of changing people's thought process, implementing cognitive dissidence where people defend the establishment as if it's themselves.
[00:58:38.564 --> 00:58:38.744]  Right.
[00:58:38.864 --> 00:58:40.525]  They see themselves as part of the system.
[00:58:40.545 --> 00:58:41.145]  Thanks for the call.
[00:58:41.585 --> 00:58:42.765]  Appreciate it, Clyde.
[00:58:42.885 --> 00:58:43.905]  We'll come back with our guests.
[00:58:43.925 --> 00:58:45.946]  We'll get to Jim and Steve and others who are patiently holding.
[00:58:46.526 --> 00:58:57.909]  Second hour with Robert Galen Ross, former NSA officer, talking about the New World Order, and one of my good buddies, Erskine, another talk show host on this network, and a ton of other just really important news stories.
[00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.469]  Stay with us.
[00:59:00.573 --> 00:59:03.074]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:59:03.094 --> 00:59:03.354]  Big Brother.
[00:59:03.374 --> 00:59:03.794]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:28.576 --> 00:59:29.617]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:30.318 --> 00:59:31.138]  You want answers?
[00:59:31.899 --> 00:59:32.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:37.124]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:37.644 --> 00:59:41.748]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:52.477]  All right, my friends, we're already into the second hour of this global transmission against tyranny as we defend liberty, resist tyranny.
[00:59:53.408 --> 00:59:59.010]  As we wage war on corruption, as we crash through the lies and disinformation, it is Monday, the 13th of October, 2003.
[00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:05.252]  And we're about to go to Jim and Steve and Elaine and Don and many others.
[01:00:05.632 --> 01:00:07.513]  We've got several guests coming up as well.
[01:00:08.173 --> 01:00:13.094]  Later I want to get more into Israel saying that they want to go ahead and go into Syria and Iran.
[01:00:13.114 --> 01:00:14.495]  Of course they started bombing there.
[01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:20.352]  As well, more on what NATO did taking over an American city last week.
[01:00:20.412 --> 01:00:22.053]  I have the mainstream news articles on this.
[01:00:22.774 --> 01:00:25.915]  It's now admitted NATO taking over an American city is part of a drill.
[01:00:26.875 --> 01:00:29.777]  Also, Moscow prepared to stage preemptive strikes.
[01:00:30.977 --> 01:00:32.717]  Israeli plans for Iran attack.
[01:00:32.737 --> 01:00:34.018]  Saddam's Syrian stash.
[01:00:34.058 --> 01:00:35.058]  More propaganda.
[01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:37.559]  RFID moves into the library.
[01:00:38.739 --> 01:00:41.640]  Self-administered vaccines to be sold at Walmart.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:45.260]  Military vaccine woes mounting as the evidence comes out of what it's doing.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.061]  And a really scary article out of Colorado Daily.
[01:00:49.601 --> 01:00:52.242]  Tiny robots in the trees is the headline.
[01:00:52.262 --> 01:00:54.262]  Yes, it's more DARPA garbage.
[01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:56.563]  This time from the Green Police.
[01:00:57.814 --> 01:01:00.196]  So we'll be getting to that as well.
[01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:03.138]  Right now, let's go to Jim in New York.
[01:01:03.218 --> 01:01:03.979]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:01:04.019 --> 01:01:04.419]  Go ahead.
[01:01:04.439 --> 01:01:05.480]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.364]  I'd like to tell you a quick story that happened to me on Friday concerning a bank.
[01:01:11.105 --> 01:01:13.106]  And I was wondering if you heard anything like this.
[01:01:13.466 --> 01:01:19.311]  I went to a music store, sold a couple hundred dollars worth of instruments, and received a check.
[01:01:20.092 --> 01:01:24.595]  And on my way home, I saw a bank that the check was issued from.
[01:01:24.675 --> 01:01:26.637]  So I drive into the drive-up teller.
[01:01:27.748 --> 01:01:33.211]  Give her the check and my license like I would normally do in the past, and she said I had to come in.
[01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:35.912]  Yeah, your slave ID card wasn't enough.
[01:01:35.972 --> 01:01:38.094]  You had to go through the biometrics, the face scanners.
[01:01:38.554 --> 01:01:43.717]  Inside, the Patriot Act went into effect October 1st on banking.
[01:01:43.977 --> 01:01:45.698]  No Fourth Amendment, no nothing.
[01:01:46.438 --> 01:01:48.839]  Even $100 cash has to be tracked.
[01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:50.100]  Everything has to be controlled.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.040]  Exactly.
[01:01:51.081 --> 01:01:52.561]  So what happened once you got inside?
[01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:53.722]  I went inside.
[01:01:55.069 --> 01:02:06.837]  I sit down, she comes over to me, and she pulls this little ink pad out, and what she asked me to do was to take my thumb fingerprint and put my fingerprint on the check.
[01:02:07.037 --> 01:02:13.281]  Yeah, and if you turn that over, that was given to them by a biometric company in Police State 3.
[01:02:13.441 --> 01:02:20.866]  I have them admitting at the grocery store that this is to train you, I've said this for years, to train you for biometrics.
[01:02:22.065 --> 01:02:24.289]  Well, in any event, I just took it and walked out.
[01:02:24.409 --> 01:02:29.557]  I said, you know, I was kind of in shock, but I was just wondering, and obviously you're saying that this is part of the process.
[01:02:29.597 --> 01:02:30.939]  Are you saying you did it or you didn't?
[01:02:31.159 --> 01:02:31.820]  Oh, I did not.
[01:02:33.002 --> 01:02:34.785]  What did you do, just deposit it in your normal bank?
[01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:35.446]  Exactly.
[01:02:36.407 --> 01:02:38.629]  But see, now they're going to try to make you do that at your bank.
[01:02:38.969 --> 01:02:44.052]  Corporations are trying to make their employees do automatic wire transfers into accounts.
[01:02:44.593 --> 01:02:48.515]  They're going to try to make you swipe your ID card to even use cash in the future.
[01:02:48.535 --> 01:02:53.218]  They're going to get that in through fast food taxes and junk food taxes.
[01:02:54.059 --> 01:02:54.899]  That's the new system.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.460]  No question.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.181]  Total control.
[01:02:58.493 --> 01:02:59.514]  But anyway, I appreciate it.
[01:02:59.534 --> 01:03:00.854]  I just wanted to tell you that.
[01:03:00.874 --> 01:03:06.357]  And obviously, I just was wondering if other people in other parts of the country are experiencing things like that.
[01:03:06.377 --> 01:03:06.838]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:06.918 --> 01:03:10.139]  In fact, they're experiencing the deeper degrees of it.
[01:03:10.159 --> 01:03:10.720]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:11.160]  Thank you.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:27.829]  Jim, yeah, in fact, about a year and a half ago, we posted, when we first started our Yahoo group, and it's still there, the Dallas Morning News and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the Denver Post, where they announced in Arlington, Texas, and the county that Denver resides in, in Colorado,
[01:03:29.157 --> 01:03:38.122]  The police just told shopkeepers in these towns, you've got to thumb scan with a biometric scanner or at least an ink pad for anybody with a credit card or anybody with a check.
[01:03:38.162 --> 01:03:44.726]  Now, they found in Arlington and they found in Denver that the stores just refused.
[01:03:44.746 --> 01:03:46.387]  Some of the big chains said, yeah, we'll do it.
[01:03:46.727 --> 01:03:48.368]  But almost everybody said, no, it's no law.
[01:03:49.088 --> 01:03:52.770]  And I have the articles where the police just said, you're going to do this.
[01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:53.771]  It's going to be the law soon.
[01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:56.545]  Now, a couple towns in England have made it the law.
[01:03:56.565 --> 01:03:58.707]  A couple cities in Canada have made the law.
[01:03:59.007 --> 01:04:01.810]  They're beta testing it, seeing how they can sell it to you.
[01:04:03.771 --> 01:04:04.752]  And it's horrible.
[01:04:04.952 --> 01:04:08.175]  It's cashless society, big brother, super evil grid.
[01:04:08.195 --> 01:04:12.139]  I mean, imagine growing up and hearing about them doing that in Russia.
[01:04:12.179 --> 01:04:13.380]  I mean, they didn't even do that in Russia.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.662]  But now in America, they think they can do it.
[01:04:16.082 --> 01:04:18.504]  The good news is it's like the smallpox shots.
[01:04:18.564 --> 01:04:19.345]  Nobody's taking it.
[01:04:19.405 --> 01:04:20.366]  Nobody's going along with it.
[01:04:21.169 --> 01:04:25.491]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:25.691 --> 01:04:30.073]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:30.253 --> 01:04:34.615]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:34.675 --> 01:04:36.016]  The New World Order.
[01:04:36.796 --> 01:04:37.117]  Can emerge.
[01:04:37.818 --> 01:04:42.022]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:42.102 --> 01:04:49.030]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:51.153]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:51.533 --> 01:05:01.861]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:02.141 --> 01:05:07.506]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:05:08.046 --> 01:05:10.668]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:05:10.788 --> 01:05:11.949]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:11.969 --> 01:05:12.410]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:14.251]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:05:20.576 --> 01:05:23.517]  Americans, get the IRS off your back legally.
[01:05:23.697 --> 01:05:26.638]  Discover the secret the IRS is terrified you'll learn.
[01:05:26.898 --> 01:05:30.180]  You probably owe no federal income tax and never have.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:37.642]  The IRS itself admits that millions and millions of Americans already have learned the truth and have dropped out of the system, and so can you.
[01:05:37.862 --> 01:05:39.523]  The federal courts and even the U.S.
[01:05:39.563 --> 01:05:47.966]  Supreme Court have verified that the reward for your labor, wages, salaries, and compensation for personal services is not and never has been taxable.
[01:05:48.346 --> 01:05:57.549]  In fact, the Supreme Court ruled over 106 years ago that such attacks imposed by the federal government on the citizens of the states would be unconstitutional and illegal.
[01:05:57.849 --> 01:05:59.589]  I know this sounds crazy and scary.
[01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:02.770]  You've been carefully trained by government propaganda for decades.
[01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:11.913]  But especially today with a tough economy, why would you let the government continue to illegally grab money from you when there's a simple, proven, and legal way to keep it all yourself?
[01:06:13.373 --> 01:06:14.173]  We're good to go.
[01:06:38.238 --> 01:06:46.165]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:06:46.566 --> 01:06:51.930]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:55.854]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:56.214 --> 01:06:58.076]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:06:58.136 --> 01:07:00.278]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:07:00.538 --> 01:07:05.141]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:07:05.201 --> 01:07:10.906]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:07:10.946 --> 01:07:12.147]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:07:12.247 --> 01:07:13.287]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:29.711]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:30.351 --> 01:07:31.172]  You want answers?
[01:07:31.952 --> 01:07:32.853]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:32.873 --> 01:07:37.415]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:37.695 --> 01:07:41.798]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:43.258 --> 01:07:50.983]  Friends, we're now 8 minutes and 30 seconds into the second hour of Global Transmission Against Tyranny.
[01:07:52.643 --> 01:08:00.245]  As we blast out on the AM and FM dial, Global Shortwave and the Internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:00.985 --> 01:08:03.065]  And, of course, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:03.185 --> 01:08:15.648]  We're about to go to Erskine, who has a great show here Saturday nights, overnight, syndicated show, and riding shotgun with us will be Robert Galen Ross, former NSA officer, expert on the New World Order, good friend of mine, just lives south of Austin.
[01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:23.132]  I remember years ago, interviewing on the radio, Robert and, of course, the mistress of LBJ who was there at the meetings.
[01:08:23.613 --> 01:08:28.454]  The admitted mistress of LBJ was there at the meeting the night before they killed JFK in Dallas.
[01:08:28.874 --> 01:08:29.994]  But we're not just getting into that.
[01:08:30.014 --> 01:08:35.375]  We're getting into the New World Order, how the Rothschilds control things, how the globalists operate.
[01:08:35.515 --> 01:08:39.596]  It's going to be an amazing hour and 20 minutes that we've got them with us.
[01:08:39.636 --> 01:08:42.557]  In the last 30 minutes of the show, I'm going to give you some other news items.
[01:08:42.597 --> 01:08:43.957]  In fact, throughout this hour...
[01:08:44.577 --> 01:08:50.078]  I'm going to be throwing out a lot of different news stories at our guests and getting their take, their response to it.
[01:08:50.098 --> 01:08:55.820]  And yes, early in the show, we'll also go to Elaine and Don and Steve and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.380]  We're going to talk about the drop in the dollar.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.081]  We're going to talk about Israel saying they want to go into Syria and Iran.
[01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:03.341]  It all ties together.
[01:09:03.521 --> 01:09:05.402]  And for those that just joined us...
[01:09:07.248 --> 01:09:08.269]  What is this show about?
[01:09:08.369 --> 01:09:30.246]  Well, history shows that powerful men, powerful empires, thousands of years ago had handbooks on controlling and manipulating populations, on balkanizing and dividing and conquering, and on using sports and gladiatorial events to control, and on how to control feudal populations, how to break up families, how to manipulate slaves.
[01:09:32.695 --> 01:09:34.676]  And then you look at modern society.
[01:09:34.716 --> 01:09:36.317]  We've totally forgotten about tyranny.
[01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:40.718]  We've totally forgotten that government centralized and powerful is dangerous.
[01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:59.245]  And we've totally disregarded all the corruption, all the evil, all the terrible things that the national security dictatorship set up in 1947, an outgrowth of the economic coup d'etat of 1913 with the Federal Reserve Act and the martial law declaration of 1933 and the War Powers Act.
[01:09:59.666 --> 01:10:00.266]  This show...
[01:10:01.292 --> 01:10:06.874]  It's about stating the reality of the world and what we face today.
[01:10:07.254 --> 01:10:30.383]  That's all we're doing is admitting the sun came up in the morning, admitting the world is round, and admitting that the geese fly south in the fall to a mass of brainwashed people that think that Arnold Schwarzenegger is anti-corruption against Enron when he was involved in Enron.
[01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:50.076]  So all we're doing is talking about facts, history, information, and how the left and right are controlled worldwide, and how we're being brought into a one-world government, and the globalists stated handbooks and public declassified white papers on how they plan to kill 80% of us.
[01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:53.198]  Public stuff, written by Henry Kissinger, okay?
[01:10:53.838 --> 01:10:54.898]  On Infowars.com.
[01:10:54.938 --> 01:10:58.079]  And before I go to my gifts, I want to challenge everybody out there.
[01:10:58.159 --> 01:10:59.720]  If you're looking for Christmas gifts...
[01:11:00.416 --> 01:11:06.897]  Or you're looking for a birthday present, or you want to give your neighbor something that's unusual that'll wake them up, order my videos.
[01:11:06.937 --> 01:11:08.698]  Get Police State Free Total Enslavement.
[01:11:08.738 --> 01:11:09.818]  Get The Masters of Terror.

[01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:13.779]  Get any of my videos.
[01:11:13.819 --> 01:11:15.839]  Get my book, 9-1-1 Descent to Tyranny.
[01:11:16.339 --> 01:11:20.400]  Get Paul Joseph Watson's new book that I published, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.181]  These materials that we've put out and produced are unlike any others.
[01:11:25.201 --> 01:11:26.541]  They're waking folks up en masse.
[01:11:26.561 --> 01:11:29.202]  They're deprogramming the American people
[01:11:29.955 --> 01:11:31.495]  But it's up to you to get them.
[01:11:31.615 --> 01:11:35.796]  And who else says, get my videos and make copies for non-profit, not for sale purposes?
[01:11:36.116 --> 01:11:37.197]  Air them on AXS TV.
[01:11:37.817 --> 01:11:38.157]  No one.
[01:11:38.417 --> 01:11:38.697]  I do.
[01:11:39.377 --> 01:11:42.418]  So get the videos and at the same time support the broadcast.
[01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:46.179]  Educate people about the real history, the real world.
[01:11:46.439 --> 01:11:49.579]  Take the blinders off and they'll go, oh, now everything makes sense.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.620]  Now politics is interesting.
[01:11:52.228 --> 01:12:00.251]  Now I understand why I need to be involved in things, involved in humanity's future, involved in defending humanity against dehumanization.
[01:12:01.111 --> 01:12:01.732]  So don't wait.
[01:12:01.812 --> 01:12:02.672]  Call and get the videos.
[01:12:02.692 --> 01:12:05.273]  They're all over two hours long, $25.95 apiece.
[01:12:05.653 --> 01:12:07.154]  Order three or more of the nine titles.
[01:12:07.174 --> 01:12:08.494]  They drop down to $20 apiece.

[01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:36.447]  That's 888-253-3139 or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order via our secure online shopping carts or simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:38.868]  Don't wait.
[01:12:39.168 --> 01:12:44.431]  Evil men and tyrants are counting on you not being involved in the information war for this republic.
[01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:47.112]  Okay, so take action today, folks.
[01:12:47.152 --> 01:12:47.612]  Don't wait.
[01:12:47.652 --> 01:12:48.473]  Take action tonight.
[01:12:48.973 --> 01:12:50.014]  Take action now.
[01:12:50.475 --> 01:12:51.235]  Get involved.
[01:12:52.837 --> 01:12:53.217]  All right.
[01:12:53.758 --> 01:12:54.839]  Going to Erskine.
[01:12:54.859 --> 01:12:55.659]  Just goes by Erskine.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.664]  There's a great Saturday night show that I've been on several times that I a lot of times end up staying up late until 2 in the morning listening to.
[01:13:00.684 --> 01:13:05.168]  And this weekend he had one of my good friends on, Robert Galen Ross, who I haven't had on in over a year.
[01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:07.010]  I thought, wow, I ought to have both these guys on.
[01:13:07.825 --> 01:13:08.085]  Thank you.
[01:13:08.105 --> 01:13:08.305]  Thank you.
[01:13:38.518 --> 01:13:42.781]  And so Erskine and Robert Galen Ross, thanks for coming on.
[01:13:42.841 --> 01:13:47.944]  First off, Robert Galen Ross, tell folks a little bit about yourself, and then we'll bring Erskine in here to tell us about himself.
[01:13:47.964 --> 01:13:49.505]  We'll launch right into this expose.
[01:13:49.965 --> 01:13:51.606]  It's a pleasure to be with you again, Alex.
[01:13:51.766 --> 01:13:52.567]  It's been a while.
[01:13:52.807 --> 01:14:01.613]  But as you said, I was a part of the NSA for about five years, two years in active duty, and...
[01:14:02.691 --> 01:14:08.919]  I've worked all over the world as an international management consultant.
[01:14:08.939 --> 01:14:16.429]  In 1992, I started my publishing company and produced my first book in 1995 titled Who's Who of the Elite?
[01:14:16.689 --> 01:14:18.472]  And then in the year 2000, I published...
[01:14:20.157 --> 01:14:24.261]  The Elite Serial Killers of Lincoln, JFK, RFK, and MLK.
[01:14:24.581 --> 01:14:29.286]  Now, Robert Galen Ross, I don't know if the listeners can hear, but we've got an echo there on your phone.
[01:14:29.306 --> 01:14:30.127]  That may be our board.
[01:14:30.147 --> 01:14:31.048]  We'll try to work on that.
[01:14:31.548 --> 01:14:33.811]  But when did you discover the New World Order?
[01:14:33.871 --> 01:14:38.055]  What finally made the light bulb go off above your head late in life?
[01:14:38.075 --> 01:14:43.981]  I mean, you'd always known about corruption and things, but what made Robert Galen Ross start waking up?
[01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:53.277]  Well, it actually went back to 1972 when a friend of mine gave me a copy of a book titled None Dare Call It Conspiracy by Gary Allen.
[01:14:53.417 --> 01:14:54.318]  That's what woke me up.
[01:14:54.618 --> 01:14:56.539]  And I couldn't get it out of my mind.
[01:14:56.619 --> 01:14:58.261]  It always stayed in the back of my mind.
[01:14:58.321 --> 01:15:06.907]  It bothered me that we had a clandestine group really in charge of everything that goes on in the entire world.
[01:15:06.987 --> 01:15:13.813]  It's sort of like the Wizard of Oz, the little fellow with the deep voice behind the curtain telling everybody what to do.
[01:15:15.186 --> 01:15:16.527]  And that bothered me.
[01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:26.091]  And I thought we had a republic here, and I found out since that we have very little control over what we do.
[01:15:26.811 --> 01:15:41.658]  So all we're doing is looking at historical, out-in-the-open facts, and we've got a general public that's been taught governments are never corrupt, governments are all-knowing, they never do any wrong, just give total control to them, turn your guns into them, let them tell you what to do with your property and your children.
[01:15:41.938 --> 01:15:42.678]  That's freedom.
[01:15:42.718 --> 01:15:43.799]  Well, that's not freedom, is it?
[01:15:44.079 --> 01:15:44.499]  That's right.
[01:15:45.822 --> 01:15:46.343]  It's amazing.
[01:15:46.363 --> 01:15:47.246]  Let's bring Erskine in.
[01:15:47.306 --> 01:15:48.488]  Erskine, thanks for coming on, sir.
[01:15:49.252 --> 01:15:49.952]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.013]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[01:15:51.113 --> 01:16:08.540]  And what really got me about Robert Galen Ross and the elite serial killers was the fact that when you look at what the country, the mess that we're in today, that the ruling people, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, all these people you've been talking about for the years, over the years, Alex, these people will stop at nothing.
[01:16:08.921 --> 01:16:16.404]  Assassination, they will absolutely do away with our Constitution, which they're doing now using 911 as an excuse for everything.
[01:16:16.884 --> 01:16:28.172]  But we had a coup d'etat that occurred with the murder of John F. Kennedy that was never solved, that was pinned on this patsy, Mr. Oswald.
[01:16:28.572 --> 01:16:32.715]  The same people were involved with all the way back to Abraham Lincoln.
[01:16:32.735 --> 01:16:36.177]  And when you're looking at this, they're telling you in their writings what they're doing.
[01:16:36.237 --> 01:16:37.478]  You've uncovered it, Alex.
[01:16:37.518 --> 01:16:38.419]  That's what they're doing.
[01:16:38.439 --> 01:16:40.400]  They're telling it in their own writings.
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.661]  And this is why we're in the mess we are today.
[01:16:43.002 --> 01:16:46.444]  The American Republic has been captured by the banksters.
[01:16:48.363 --> 01:16:55.985]  And, you know, in major polls, 80-plus percent of the American people know they're being lied to about the Kennedy assassination, but they'll still call us conspiracy theorists.
[01:16:56.005 --> 01:17:00.007]  I guess 80 percent of us, Robert, Gail, and Ross, are just crazy.
[01:17:00.887 --> 01:17:13.811]  Well, they call us kooks, and really the object is to try to ridicule us and to make us look ridiculous so that no one will listen to us because we're trying to get the truth out.
[01:17:15.672 --> 01:17:17.032]  But that's not working anymore.
[01:17:17.072 --> 01:17:21.554]  You know, I do talk radio interviews on my own show five, six years ago, and you've got lots of people that disagreed.
[01:17:21.854 --> 01:17:26.616]  Now the show is conservatively 50 times bigger, and no one calls in a disagree.
[01:17:26.656 --> 01:17:28.816]  And I'm a lot more friendly than I used to be, by the way.
[01:17:29.657 --> 01:17:31.057]  It's not that I'm mean to callers, either.
[01:17:32.037 --> 01:17:33.098]  Why aren't they calling now?
[01:17:33.118 --> 01:17:33.958]  I mean, on the street.
[01:17:34.538 --> 01:17:44.446]  I was at a gas station last night getting some gas at Diamond Shamrock, where probably five people I walked by in the parking lot, four of them, four separate vehicles, came up and were telling me, death to the New World Order.
[01:17:45.246 --> 01:17:48.929]  Have you guys seen a major awakening in the last few years, Robert Erskine?
[01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:50.210]  No, no question about it.
[01:17:51.076 --> 01:18:00.000]  I was talking with Robert earlier, and 15 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, the things we're talking about, they would have said, oh, you're a nutcase, get out of here.
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:02.561]  But today, people are waking up.
[01:18:02.601 --> 01:18:10.805]  When you've got a president of the United States talking about secret government, these are... Yeah, shadow government.
[01:18:11.265 --> 01:18:12.785]  Sounds like he had a drop on his line there.
[01:18:13.546 --> 01:18:15.647]  Shadow government is what we're talking about.
[01:18:16.687 --> 01:18:18.648]  Robert, you've seen a major awakening?
[01:18:19.372 --> 01:18:20.754]  Yeah, no question about it.
[01:18:20.834 --> 01:18:31.925]  Like Erskine, go back five years and probably 15 out of 100 people would accept what I was saying.
[01:18:31.945 --> 01:18:34.007]  The others said, I don't want to hear that stuff.
[01:18:34.968 --> 01:18:39.492]  And now it's down to maybe five out of 100 don't want to hear it.
[01:18:40.033 --> 01:18:41.274]  Everyone else is eager to hear it.
[01:18:42.905 --> 01:18:43.385]  Absolutely.
[01:18:43.405 --> 01:18:44.966]  When we get back, we've got a bunch of callers.
[01:18:44.986 --> 01:18:49.707]  I want to get them out of the way early, but then I want to get into just an encapsulation, what your book gets into.
[01:18:49.747 --> 01:18:50.347]  It's excellent.
[01:18:51.367 --> 01:18:54.508]  On the eyewitnesses you've got of what really happened with Kennedy, that secret meeting.
[01:18:55.108 --> 01:19:01.630]  Then we're going into RFK, MLK, how you talked, of course, to James Earl Ray right before he died in the hospital two weeks before.
[01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:03.290]  We'll go through that.
[01:19:04.127 --> 01:19:11.574]  And then I want to throw out the news of the day, the dropping dollar, the invasion of the Middle East, everything that's developing.
[01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:15.518]  All right, folks, we've got them for another, what, hour and ten minutes.
[01:19:15.538 --> 01:19:16.879]  We're going to have them halfway into the next hour.
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.381]  That's Erskine and Robert Galen Ross.
[01:19:19.441 --> 01:19:20.122]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:22.594 --> 01:19:28.536]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[01:20:20.542 --> 01:20:22.203]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:20:22.223 --> 01:20:24.724]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:48.656 --> 01:20:50.377]  of the self-sterilizing filters.

[01:21:21.474 --> 01:21:23.695]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:21:24.135 --> 01:21:28.476]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:28.756 --> 01:21:34.558]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:34.798 --> 01:21:38.860]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:44.782]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:21:44.882 --> 01:21:47.502]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:49.603 --> 01:21:53.126]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:21:53.246 --> 01:21:55.928]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:21:56.268 --> 01:21:58.569]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:21:58.950 --> 01:22:02.592]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:22:03.053 --> 01:22:09.257]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:22:09.717 --> 01:22:10.678]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:22:11.038 --> 01:22:11.358]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:11.378 --> 01:22:11.578]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:20.393 --> 01:22:21.214]  Oh my God!
[01:22:21.474 --> 01:22:26.197]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:22:26.497 --> 01:22:27.158]  Yes, it's true.
[01:22:27.258 --> 01:22:29.939]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:22:30.079 --> 01:22:34.102]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:22:34.222 --> 01:22:34.763]  You heard it right.
[01:22:34.943 --> 01:22:39.966]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:22:40.046 --> 01:22:40.506]  We're good to go.
[01:22:57.355 --> 01:22:58.376]  You may miss out forever.
[01:22:58.516 --> 01:23:02.778]  To participate in this limited time offer and have your drugs prescribed over the phone for free, you need to call 1-800-615-7094 now.
[01:23:02.898 --> 01:23:07.540]  That's 1-800-615-7094 for drugs like Phentermine, Ambien, Theoroset, Sama, Ultram, Viagra, and many more.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:08.721]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:09.741]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[01:23:25.851 --> 01:23:27.753]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:31.056]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:33.799 --> 01:23:35.981]  Hey, I bet Rush Limbaugh would like that last ad.
[01:23:36.001 --> 01:23:38.463]  I mean, come on.
[01:23:39.224 --> 01:23:47.893]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, back live with Erskine, who does a show Saturday nights here on the network and does a great job.
[01:23:47.913 --> 01:23:50.215]  And, of course, Robert Galen Ross, a good friend of mine right here in Austin.
[01:23:51.185 --> 01:23:54.367]  I want to go to... And we're going to go, everybody, I promise, next segment.
[01:23:54.387 --> 01:23:57.268]  I want to go to Steve and Elaine and Don and Spencer and everybody else.
[01:23:58.729 --> 01:24:05.633]  Because I want to get through these calls quick because I want to get into some of the topical news and how this ties into the New World Order from both our guests' perspectives.
[01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:08.434]  But Robert Galen Ross and the nurse can jump in any time.
[01:24:08.454 --> 01:24:09.595]  I know you've got some audio clips.
[01:24:11.696 --> 01:24:11.996]  Galen!
[01:24:12.597 --> 01:24:15.319]  For folks just tuning in, what is the New World Order?
[01:24:15.439 --> 01:24:16.420]  How does it operate?
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:23.545]  And in a nutshell, go into the assassination of what happened with Kennedy, RFK, and, of course, MLK.
[01:24:24.206 --> 01:24:40.378]  Well, of course, the New World Order, it started way back as the Illuminati and has taken on several different persona, but today it's actually headed up by the international bankers, primarily the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, and
[01:24:40.931 --> 01:24:48.914]  Their goal is to politically and economically dominate the entire world under what they used to call the New World Order.
[01:24:49.574 --> 01:25:00.177]  But today they use a generic term like globalization, global economy, global architecture, and these sort of things exactly equal the old term New World Order.
[01:25:00.337 --> 01:25:04.579]  But they are on their path to create this New World Order.
[01:25:04.659 --> 01:25:08.100]  And in my last video, I proved that
[01:25:08.772 --> 01:25:26.154]  They plan to create the American Union in the year 2005, and I quote Vice President Dick Cheney saying in his speech to the America's Union that they will complete the free trade area with America by...
[01:25:27.068 --> 01:25:27.708]  January 2005.
[01:25:27.768 --> 01:25:36.091]  Well, in fact, they're meeting in Florida this month to go to the next phase of the free trade of the Americas, which is the American Union.
[01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:38.252]  That's how the EU started was a trade deal.
[01:25:38.572 --> 01:25:49.996]  That's right, and they're lobbying to get the American Union headquarters either in Miami, and Erskine, I believe, thinks they're going to do it in Colorado.
[01:25:50.176 --> 01:25:52.997]  Well, they've said Miami or Atlanta in the articles I've seen.
[01:25:53.337 --> 01:25:53.517]  Yeah.
[01:25:54.338 --> 01:25:59.321]  But this is really happening, and you won't see it in the mainstream news media.
[01:26:00.502 --> 01:26:07.647]  What they call CAFTA, which is the Central American Free Trade Area, they plan to complete that by December of this year.
[01:26:08.633 --> 01:26:13.536]  And by the way, the military martial law command base of NORTHCOM is Colorado.
[01:26:13.916 --> 01:26:17.738]  The economic command base of the Americas will be Atlanta or Miami.
[01:26:18.418 --> 01:26:20.880]  That's stated about a year ago, two years ago.
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:24.122]  Again, every year they have these meetings and restate it.
[01:26:24.602 --> 01:26:28.304]  But again, the average person will have no idea what this is, but they're sure going to lose their jobs.
[01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:30.065]  Why is that part of their plan?
[01:26:30.845 --> 01:26:34.187]  How does getting rid of our factories fit into things, Robert?
[01:26:34.567 --> 01:26:34.988]  Well, they...
[01:26:36.383 --> 01:26:49.150]  The international bankers purely look at the dollar in their pocket, and they send the manufacturing jobs to the lowest labor rate and benefit rate in the world.
[01:26:49.931 --> 01:26:54.313]  And then they send it back to the United States and try to sell it to the U.S.
[01:26:54.373 --> 01:26:54.854]  public.
[01:26:55.314 --> 01:26:59.296]  And they don't really understand what Henry Ford knew very well.
[01:26:59.316 --> 01:27:00.517]  Henry Ford says...
[01:27:01.098 --> 01:27:05.341]  I pay my workers a lot of money because I want them to buy my cars.
[01:27:05.662 --> 01:27:13.048]  Well, look, I mean, with mercantilism, the older model, the Renaissance-resistant mercantilism, it's about control.
[01:27:13.068 --> 01:27:21.134]  So we can say, well, they want the lowest rate, but it's also in their own papers, the IMF and World Bank papers, about getting rid of a middle class that could threaten them.
[01:27:21.174 --> 01:27:22.275]  That's correct.
[01:27:22.295 --> 01:27:28.580]  They have opened our borders to allow the foreigners to come into this country illegally to...
[01:27:29.495 --> 01:27:31.236]  Let's go to Erskine for a second.
[01:27:31.277 --> 01:27:37.161]  Erskine, 87% of Americans to 89% are against the open borders and NAFTA and GATT now.
[01:27:37.181 --> 01:27:39.382]  It was 60% when they passed it.
[01:27:39.402 --> 01:27:44.146]  People know this doesn't work, so why are they expanding in Erskine?
[01:27:44.206 --> 01:27:45.146]  Are we in a free society?
[01:27:57.913 --> 01:27:58.753]  Couple of reasons.
[01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:06.676]  I had a person on who worked for the Immigration Border Patrol, and he was in charge of the Tucson District, and he said, listen to it this way.
[01:28:06.736 --> 01:28:10.177]  I said, why aren't the Democrats, why aren't the Republicans doing anything?
[01:28:10.457 --> 01:28:16.619]  He said they work for the wealthy Republicans in the daytime and sleep in the barrios with the Democrats at night.
[01:28:16.639 --> 01:28:18.120]  He said both sides, they win.
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:19.140]  Now, here's what's happened.
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:20.101]  We're good to go.
[01:28:40.642 --> 01:28:43.743]  Is that you have the illegals coming over.
[01:28:43.843 --> 01:28:45.984]  You've got everyone used to work at the plant.
[01:28:46.124 --> 01:28:47.124]  We all remember that.
[01:28:47.204 --> 01:28:48.765]  Your listeners remember that.
[01:28:48.965 --> 01:28:50.705]  The plant's gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:50.745 --> 01:28:51.946]  The plant is gone.
[01:28:52.306 --> 01:28:52.706]  All right.
[01:28:52.786 --> 01:28:54.606]  And they tell us, we're going to give you more of this.
[01:28:55.747 --> 01:28:59.368]  Galen Ross, is Erskine on target?
[01:29:01.428 --> 01:29:02.469]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:29:02.569 --> 01:29:05.210]  Erskine is very well informed, as you are.
[01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:06.990]  I'll tell you what, we'll be right back.
[01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:09.411]  We're going to take your calls and get into the assassination.
[01:29:09.431 --> 01:29:09.831]  Stay with us.
[01:29:11.465 --> 01:29:12.366]  We're on the march.
[01:29:12.867 --> 01:29:14.469]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:18.093]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:23.666]  We're good to go.

[01:31:22.239 --> 01:31:26.741]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:31:27.101 --> 01:31:31.202]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:31:31.482 --> 01:31:32.022]  We listened.
[01:31:32.343 --> 01:31:37.324]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:31:37.604 --> 01:31:38.084]  We listened.
[01:31:38.465 --> 01:31:41.506]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:31:41.926 --> 01:31:42.466]  We listened.
[01:31:42.926 --> 01:31:45.067]  You asked us to include an emergency light for
[01:31:47.359 --> 01:31:50.742]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at
[01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:17.091]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:32:17.311 --> 01:32:19.972]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:32:31.674 --> 01:32:38.956]  Why has so much time, so much energy been put into convincing people that there is no world government, government doesn't do anything corrupt,
[01:32:39.682 --> 01:32:40.622]  Just stay in the dark.
[01:32:40.682 --> 01:32:42.403]  Anybody that asks questions is bad.
[01:32:43.063 --> 01:32:45.244]  America was about standing up to the empire.
[01:32:45.284 --> 01:32:47.966]  America was about having local control.
[01:32:48.326 --> 01:32:53.928]  America was about asking questions and getting up on your soapbox and juries bossing judges around.
[01:32:55.229 --> 01:32:56.349]  And now we've been neutered.
[01:32:56.389 --> 01:32:57.630]  We've been emasculated.
[01:32:58.090 --> 01:32:59.290]  We've been domesticated.
[01:33:00.331 --> 01:33:05.193]  We've got Robert Galen Ross, former NSA officer, worked for the oil companies as a consultant.
[01:33:05.845 --> 01:33:06.265]  Absolutely.
[01:33:06.285 --> 01:33:06.806]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:33:34.371 --> 01:33:36.553]  Real quick, Erskine, we ran into the break.
[01:33:36.873 --> 01:33:38.555]  You were making points about the illegals.
[01:33:38.895 --> 01:33:41.798]  Everybody's against it in the country, but it continues.
[01:33:41.838 --> 01:33:43.159]  You want to finish your comments on that?
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.181]  Well, it's very, very simple.
[01:33:45.221 --> 01:33:52.208]  You've got the Republicans who are using the workers over here, and like I said on my program, I had to call from...
[01:33:52.788 --> 01:33:54.329]  Pennsylvania call from Kentucky.
[01:33:54.349 --> 01:33:56.749]  $17 an hour in the meatpacking industry.
[01:33:56.809 --> 01:33:59.931]  Now they're getting $7 an hour in the meatpacking industry.
[01:34:00.231 --> 01:34:03.432]  The Republican, rich Republicans are loving it.
[01:34:03.912 --> 01:34:05.512]  And at night they're with the Democrats.
[01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:09.654]  One other thing I'd like to make a statement about, and that is concerning.
[01:34:10.334 --> 01:34:10.835]  We're good to go.
[01:34:36.495 --> 01:34:39.136]  Lord Rothschild along with Warren Buffett.
[01:34:39.156 --> 01:34:40.277]  You've got the picture there.
[01:34:40.297 --> 01:34:42.718]  This wasn't taken in 1992.
[01:34:42.998 --> 01:34:45.039]  This was taken in 2002.
[01:34:45.759 --> 01:34:50.221]  Yeah, September 24th, you've got Arnold there with Buffett getting their orders.
[01:34:50.281 --> 01:34:55.063]  And then there it is in a book written two years ago by Robert Galen Ross describing these characters.
[01:34:55.383 --> 01:35:02.566]  And then Arnold is in the Enron meeting with only a few dozen other select people running the Enron scam, profiting from it.
[01:35:02.806 --> 01:35:05.707]  And then they come in and say, we're cleaning a house.
[01:35:06.087 --> 01:35:09.890]  To end all this, and he says he'll continue every Gray Davis tactic.
[01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:15.354]  Isn't this a tactic of changing the figurehead but leaving the policies the same, Robert?
[01:35:15.614 --> 01:35:19.096]  Even worse, who was Arnold's campaign manager?
[01:35:19.116 --> 01:35:22.278]  It was Pete Wilson who deregulated energy in California.
[01:35:22.599 --> 01:35:24.280]  Excuse me, wake up!
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:34.507]  Yeah, Enron and several other energy companies have ripped off California by on the tune of something like $9 billion with overcharges.
[01:35:35.821 --> 01:35:39.403]  And who controls the oil pipelines now going into California?
[01:35:39.443 --> 01:35:41.885]  They were bought by a company owned by Warren Buffett.
[01:35:44.407 --> 01:35:49.411]  And now there's editorials with the liberals, people calling themselves liberals, calling for Arnold to be president.
[01:35:50.392 --> 01:36:01.961]  Over the weekend, just all these editorials about how wonderful he is, pro-abortion, open borders, anti-gun, says he's going to keep giving the ID cards to the illegals, and they call this a change.
[01:36:03.531 --> 01:36:14.039]  And you've got the oral inspector, the magic bullet expert, that's talking about changing the law allowing foreigners to become president of the United States.
[01:36:14.159 --> 01:36:15.200]  So is Orrin Hatch.
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:16.741]  It's just amazing.
[01:36:16.801 --> 01:36:21.985]  That's all in the Arnold section, but it's just incredible, folks.
[01:36:22.025 --> 01:36:24.327]  He's going to stop the corruption when he's part of it.
[01:36:24.347 --> 01:36:29.331]  You know, it's like I'm going to punch you in the face and then promise to punish my fist.
[01:36:30.292 --> 01:36:31.553]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[01:36:33.562 --> 01:36:35.143]  Let's talk to Steve in Florida.
[01:36:35.183 --> 01:36:35.943]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:36:35.983 --> 01:36:36.383]  Go ahead.
[01:36:36.763 --> 01:36:37.204]  Hello, Alex.
[01:36:37.244 --> 01:36:54.090]  Before I knew you had these two fine guests, earlier I was dialing in to speak to you about the Army Corps of Engineers approving a lease of 106 acres to the NYCA Muslim Youth Camps of America on Federal Park property right next to the Coralville Reserve there in Iowa.
[01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:58.311]  But children can't take their Bibles in their backpacks to school.
[01:36:58.651 --> 01:37:00.952]  Right, and here the Army Corps of Engineers received...
[01:37:01.363 --> 01:37:09.786]  Permission from Congressman Joe Hefley, who was on a subcommittee, to lease this 106 acres so they can start training Islamic Muslims.
[01:37:09.866 --> 01:37:14.168]  It'll be transferred here from Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt, and Indonesia.
[01:37:14.288 --> 01:37:16.549]  Hey, hey, record human events reported.
[01:37:16.829 --> 01:37:22.571]  Record numbers of people being given visas from terrorist-sponsored nations since 9-11.
[01:37:22.911 --> 01:37:29.994]  It's obvious that the destabilizing is being done purposely in the U.S., and as you know, and your guests know probably better than I, Islam is a
[01:37:30.444 --> 01:37:31.325]  Theocratic religion.
[01:37:31.345 --> 01:37:35.049]  They're commanded by Allah to take over the government and to restrict other religions.
[01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:39.854]  But see, the Masons secretly are into worshipping the Fez and the moon.
[01:37:39.874 --> 01:37:40.635]  That's their symbol.
[01:37:40.895 --> 01:37:41.816]  And they love all this.
[01:37:41.836 --> 01:37:44.559]  Well, the Masons have that rock structure there in Georgia.
[01:37:44.599 --> 01:37:45.300]  Anybody can look at it.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.982]  It has the Ten Commandments of the New Age.
[01:37:47.603 --> 01:37:50.806]  The first commandment is to reduce population to 500 million.
[01:37:50.826 --> 01:37:51.787]  The Masons put that up in 1985.
[01:37:54.142 --> 01:37:56.144]  No, you're absolutely on target with that.
[01:37:56.204 --> 01:37:58.526]  What do you think about the plunging dollar?
[01:37:58.747 --> 01:38:00.929]  Israel announcing they're going to go into all these new countries.
[01:38:01.269 --> 01:38:07.335]  I think the plunging dollar is being done purposely to bring us to economic ruin and political and military takeover or destruction.
[01:38:07.375 --> 01:38:08.336]  I was trying to tell people...
[01:38:08.857 --> 01:38:11.739]  Three years ago with his new colored money, but I was getting scoffed at.
[01:38:11.999 --> 01:38:18.663]  Do you remember, because I know you've been listening for a long time, when I read the Federal Reserve plan to come out with the new money, devalue the currency.
[01:38:18.723 --> 01:38:19.523]  Now it's all happened.
[01:38:19.563 --> 01:38:23.626]  It comes out, it's being devalued, it's got RFID in it to track you.
[01:38:24.326 --> 01:38:27.808]  I mean, I remember people going, it's not true, the money will not come out colored.
[01:38:28.548 --> 01:38:36.373]  I know, as your two guests know, and you know, and all of us know, these things have been written in their own writings, but people scoff at you, and then they...
[01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:39.970]  Then what happens is they never heard it from you.
[01:38:40.090 --> 01:38:42.610]  They knew it all along, and they denied that you told them.
[01:38:42.911 --> 01:38:45.871]  It's a malaise, a blindness over much of the population.
[01:38:45.891 --> 01:38:47.972]  And they'll tell you, oh, it's good to have a weak dollar.
[01:38:48.112 --> 01:38:48.692]  Oh, yes.
[01:38:49.032 --> 01:38:57.554]  I would just encourage the people, especially here in Pensacola, that are retired military, stop being cowards and tell people what's going on because you know what's going on.
[01:38:58.054 --> 01:38:59.155]  I did a military career.
[01:38:59.655 --> 01:39:00.355]  I know the evil.
[01:39:00.415 --> 01:39:04.536]  I know what we did in Panama, murdering civilians, using laser weapons on them.
[01:39:04.961 --> 01:39:06.102]  I know what we did in Somalia.
[01:39:06.142 --> 01:39:06.502]  I was there.
[01:39:06.522 --> 01:39:07.682]  I know what we did in Cambodia.
[01:39:07.742 --> 01:39:08.142]  I was there.
[01:39:08.503 --> 01:39:12.665]  And a lot of people listening to this station right now in this city know what's going on.
[01:39:12.685 --> 01:39:15.166]  Stop being cowards and stand up and tell people.
[01:39:16.546 --> 01:39:16.966]  Wow.
[01:39:17.267 --> 01:39:17.987]  Thank you, sir.
[01:39:18.047 --> 01:39:18.867]  Call back any time.
[01:39:19.147 --> 01:39:23.149]  I'd like you to call back sometime when we don't have guests on and tell us about what you did in those countries.
[01:39:23.649 --> 01:39:24.750]  A lot of warriors.
[01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:27.991]  Alex, why don't your callers say what they mean?
[01:39:28.091 --> 01:39:29.412]  I don't understand this.
[01:39:29.432 --> 01:39:30.813]  I'm so namby-pamby.
[01:39:31.333 --> 01:39:31.473]  Well,
[01:39:31.653 --> 01:39:36.697]  You know, there's a lot of warriors like Robert Galen Ross who was there on the DMZ with North Korea for years and the NSA.
[01:39:37.057 --> 01:39:44.223]  There's a lot of patriots who did incredible things because they believed it was for America and now they know it was a fraud.
[01:39:44.543 --> 01:39:51.749]  Robert, what was it like for you to serve in such dangerous situations that we don't have time to get into today and then to find out in the 70s that it was all a fraud?
[01:39:51.789 --> 01:39:52.610]  What was that like for you?
[01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:57.453]  Well, at the time, I thought what I was doing was a noble thing to do.
[01:39:57.473 --> 01:40:08.481]  I was there listening to Chinese Communist radio conversations and sent them back to NSA headquarters, and I said, man, I'm really doing something important.
[01:40:08.701 --> 01:40:15.366]  But today, I know that the NSA listens in on every electronic communication in the world, and so I'm not proud of it.
[01:40:16.145 --> 01:40:17.666]  My membership in that group.
[01:40:18.226 --> 01:40:22.147]  And it's not used to go after real terrorists or criminals.
[01:40:22.207 --> 01:40:27.828]  It's used to protect the terrorists and protect the criminals whenever people find out about the globalist operations.
[01:40:29.509 --> 01:40:30.489]  Let's take another call.
[01:40:30.529 --> 01:40:35.271]  Let's talk to... Oh, I guess up next is Elaine in Texas.
[01:40:35.331 --> 01:40:36.171]  Elaine, you're on the air.
[01:40:36.211 --> 01:40:36.611]  Go ahead.
[01:40:37.511 --> 01:40:37.851]  Hi.
[01:40:38.091 --> 01:40:42.453]  I wanted to touch back to the electronic voting thing a bit.
[01:40:43.113 --> 01:40:43.393]  I read...
[01:40:44.369 --> 01:40:46.791]  Yeah, and the League of Women Voters is against H.R.
[01:40:46.811 --> 01:40:47.772]  2239 and Congressman Holt.
[01:41:05.733 --> 01:41:08.856]  Rush Holt that brought that forward a month and a half ago.
[01:41:09.196 --> 01:41:15.682]  They're trying to block there being a paper trail, and they found wireless transmitters in the voting machine companies.
[01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:22.027]  They've caught them going in the back door, and there's former CIA deputy directors running all three of the companies.
[01:41:23.088 --> 01:41:24.189]  This is all public.
[01:41:24.289 --> 01:41:32.977]  Erskine, Robert, how important is it to have the government involved with the CIA in these touchscreen companies and trying to block a paper trail?
[01:41:33.477 --> 01:41:36.243]  Well, it's to nullify the election process.
[01:41:36.583 --> 01:41:40.471]  That's the whole point of it, and to make it come out the way they want to.
[01:41:42.161 --> 01:41:43.522]  Let me add something on there.
[01:41:43.602 --> 01:41:54.806]  First off, coming up with the next election, the military vote is all going to be done electronically with touchscreen, and that is 5% of the vote, and that can certainly easily be manipulated.
[01:41:55.166 --> 01:42:02.369]  Of the three main manufacturers of voting machines, one of the manufacturers is owned by, excuse me, the Carlyle Group.
[01:42:02.429 --> 01:42:04.029]  Do we have to go any further than that?
[01:42:04.129 --> 01:42:05.670]  Alex, you've already talked about them.
[01:42:06.912 --> 01:42:14.218]  I know, and even in Wired Magazine's four-page detailed whitewash, it's, well, they accidentally went into the machines during elections and changed votes.
[01:42:14.238 --> 01:42:16.179]  Well, they accidentally had wireless transmitters.
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:19.902]  Well, they accidentally did this and that and had huge back doors into it.
[01:42:20.463 --> 01:42:27.368]  Well, they accidentally put out computer programs of how to go in, manipulate the votes, and then have it erase the record of that.
[01:42:27.428 --> 01:42:29.129]  It's all accidental, Erskine.
[01:42:29.850 --> 01:42:34.854]  Wasn't it Joseph Stalin said, I don't care how people vote, I care about who counts the votes?
[01:42:35.889 --> 01:42:36.429]  Absolutely.
[01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:43.373]  Robert, right after they killed Kennedy in 1963, they put in the voter news services.
[01:42:45.014 --> 01:42:47.375]  But see, the average American doesn't know how the votes get counted.
[01:42:47.415 --> 01:42:48.455]  People should ask themselves.
[01:42:48.515 --> 01:42:49.156]  We know how.
[01:42:49.236 --> 01:42:49.696]  We've read it.
[01:42:49.956 --> 01:42:50.456]  We've studied it.
[01:42:50.496 --> 01:42:50.916]  We know.
[01:42:51.216 --> 01:42:53.958]  Can you describe what they did after they killed Kennedy with the election system?
[01:42:54.638 --> 01:43:01.541]  Well, they have gradually changed the entire system so that they absolutely control all votes.
[01:43:02.662 --> 01:43:03.162]  It's really...
[01:43:05.649 --> 01:43:11.933]  You really ought to vote, but you need to know that once you do that vote, that they're going to manipulate it.
[01:43:12.313 --> 01:43:23.980]  And the only way to stop this and correct it is get back to paper ballots counted by committees of the local neighborhood and then published in the local newspaper so that they can manipulate it.
[01:43:24.781 --> 01:43:30.985]  But the League of Women Voters is arguing to block any paper record of a touchscreen.
[01:43:31.485 --> 01:43:33.086]  I wonder why they do that.
[01:43:34.107 --> 01:43:34.667]  Yeah, right.
[01:43:35.382 --> 01:43:37.903]  Okay, Elaine, does that answer your question, or do you have more you want to add?
[01:43:38.023 --> 01:43:45.525]  Well, I just thought it was interesting because that was the first time I had heard of it in a little, you know, alternative paper in Austin.
[01:43:46.125 --> 01:43:49.566]  And so I thought there's probably a lot more people out there that have not heard of it.
[01:43:50.266 --> 01:43:54.888]  And I wanted to just get that information out in case people didn't know about it.
[01:43:55.028 --> 01:44:00.089]  We have a giant election fraud section on prisonplanet.com.
[01:44:00.449 --> 01:44:02.790]  Get the URL, email it out to everybody.
[01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:03.924]  All right.
[01:44:04.145 --> 01:44:05.285]  You're awesome, Elaine.
[01:44:05.365 --> 01:44:06.206]  Thanks for all your work.
[01:44:06.266 --> 01:44:06.747]  It's wonderful.
[01:44:06.767 --> 01:44:17.235]  You've got some websites like blackboxvoting.com, and you've got Vote Fraud, Vote Scam, and it's all up there on your website, infowars.com.
[01:44:17.255 --> 01:44:25.562]  Hey, in the 1998 election, ABC News, a full 36 hours before the election, posted the exact results of the major states.
[01:44:27.811 --> 01:44:33.117]  Someone there on purpose, just like this Diebold employee, this engineer's gone public.
[01:44:33.537 --> 01:44:35.839]  You know, he'll be blackballed by Diebold now.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:43.507]  I mean, there's good... Somebody at ABC News released the exact numbers, and they didn't think enough of us to even change the fraud the next day.
[01:44:44.508 --> 01:44:49.994]  Isn't it amazing that all the constitutional amendments in our last election passed?
[01:44:51.167 --> 01:44:53.789]  Yeah, right here in Texas where they put in the touchscreens.
[01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:55.831]  Thanks for the call, Elaine.
[01:44:56.332 --> 01:45:01.716]  Speaking of manipulating things, this is out of the Olympian, out of Olympia, Washington, big newspaper.
[01:45:02.297 --> 01:45:04.419]  Many soldiers, same letter.
[01:45:05.094 --> 01:45:06.095]  We also know why... Whoa!
[01:45:29.241 --> 01:45:30.862]  I think Erskine's line's having some trouble.
[01:45:30.882 --> 01:45:32.023]  A little bit.
[01:45:32.063 --> 01:45:32.764]  We're okay now.
[01:45:32.904 --> 01:45:35.206]  Okay, it says, many soldiers, same letter.
[01:45:35.666 --> 01:45:36.607]  Newspapers around the U.S.
[01:45:36.627 --> 01:45:39.169]  get identical letters from Iraq.
[01:45:39.209 --> 01:45:43.072]  The Olympian recently received these two letters from area soldiers stationed in Iraq.
[01:45:43.332 --> 01:45:48.796]  The letters are identical to appear to be part of a campaign to present a positive picture of U.S.
[01:45:48.936 --> 01:45:49.577]  occupation.
[01:45:49.617 --> 01:45:49.937]  Go ahead.
[01:45:52.217 --> 01:45:52.997]  Erskine comments?
[01:45:53.298 --> 01:45:53.578]  Yes.
[01:45:53.938 --> 01:46:01.381]  Oh, well, that's the letter that was sent out, and the same letter was sent out to all these newspapers, and you don't think that's trying to influence things.
[01:46:01.401 --> 01:46:03.402]  A couple of other things that ought to be brought up.
[01:46:04.322 --> 01:46:08.744]  Under the new We're Going to Keep America Safe, the Land of the Brave, the Home of the Free,
[01:46:09.384 --> 01:46:09.624]  And then...
[01:46:30.575 --> 01:46:44.846]  And that's just the cover for the states and the feds, admittedly, under the DARPA total information, which, by the way, got funding, they just changed the name, to gather data on everything, and they're going to make you do caps, too, to have a job, to drive down the road, everything.
[01:46:45.686 --> 01:46:52.411]  And the last thing that they have is a civilian inmate labor facility where they are going to hold up to 7 million citizens.
[01:46:52.471 --> 01:46:55.454]  This is not conspiracy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:55.474 --> 01:46:56.194]  This is fact.
[01:46:56.434 --> 01:46:59.216]  Giant concentration camp section on Infowars.com.
[01:46:59.236 --> 01:46:59.937]  Let me throw this out.
[01:47:24.644 --> 01:47:25.745]  Sonomish, Washington.
[01:47:25.765 --> 01:47:33.651]  The Olympia received two identical letters signed by different hometown soldiers, Speck Joshua Ackler and Speck Alex Morris.
[01:47:33.811 --> 01:47:36.414]  Now, guaranteed, if these guys get out of line, they're going to die in combat.
[01:47:36.434 --> 01:47:37.174]  The feds will kill them.
[01:47:37.715 --> 01:47:39.977]  And the guarantee, they're being told to shut up right now.
[01:47:40.397 --> 01:47:45.081]  The paper declined to run, either because of a policy not to publish form letters.
[01:47:45.641 --> 01:47:46.101]  And it goes on.
[01:47:46.141 --> 01:47:55.104]  The five-paragraph letter talks about the soldiers ever to reestablish police and fire departments and build water and sewer plants in the northern city of Kirk, where the unit is based.
[01:47:55.144 --> 01:48:00.586]  The quality of life and security of the citizens has been largely restored, and we are a large part of why that has happened.
[01:48:00.906 --> 01:48:04.487]  These letters aren't even... And now I've got reports that it's in hundreds of newspapers.
[01:48:04.527 --> 01:48:06.087]  Gentlemen, Robert comments.
[01:48:06.707 --> 01:48:09.688]  Yeah, it's man control.
[01:48:09.828 --> 01:48:11.429]  It's disinformation.
[01:48:12.652 --> 01:48:13.912]  They've been doing it for years.
[01:48:13.973 --> 01:48:24.381]  They're just concentrating more now, trying to cover up the acts that they're trying to do and to confuse the citizens.
[01:48:24.801 --> 01:48:26.682]  What should this mean to listeners, though?
[01:48:27.083 --> 01:48:30.025]  I mean, I tell them that the sitcoms and the dramas are full of propaganda.
[01:48:30.646 --> 01:48:34.587]  Where all Christians should be arrested, all gun owners are bad, all homeschoolers are bad.
[01:48:34.967 --> 01:48:40.549]  I mean, folks, torture's good, but it's not just propaganda in the news and in the newspapers and in the sitcoms.
[01:48:41.209 --> 01:48:44.270]  Now it's the newspapers with fake letters.
[01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:46.291]  Folks, this is not a good government!
[01:48:46.949 --> 01:48:48.749]  You're being inundated with this.
[01:48:48.949 --> 01:48:55.030]  I was watching CNN that's in every airport in the country, and I was sitting there, and I just yelled bull at that.
[01:48:55.310 --> 01:49:05.252]  Now, Robert, you, or Galen, in your book, you have an article where you talk about people getting together and deciding they only needed to control 25 newspapers in 1919.
[01:49:05.492 --> 01:49:06.852]  They controlled all the news.
[01:49:06.932 --> 01:49:07.533]  Isn't that right?
[01:49:07.833 --> 01:49:08.493]  That's correct.
[01:49:09.373 --> 01:49:15.974]  And so they control all major mainstream news media, television, newspapers, news magazines.
[01:49:16.814 --> 01:49:20.558]  What year was that, Galen?
[01:49:20.578 --> 01:49:25.522]  1917, 1919, something like that, but it came out in the congressional record.
[01:49:26.223 --> 01:49:32.888]  Yeah, I've read all that where they say, well, in the 70s, David Rockefeller thanked the media for keeping a lid on the New World Order.
[01:49:33.289 --> 01:49:33.469]  Yes.
[01:49:34.784 --> 01:49:50.574]  We're going to come back and talk to Don and Spencer and others, and then we may suspend calls for the next 30 minutes or the next hour, just because, at least for 20 minutes or so, because I want to get into the assassinations of RFK, JFK, MLK, and the power structure of the New World Order, because I agree with Robert Galen Ross's analysis of that.
[01:49:50.594 --> 01:49:54.016]  We'll get Galen's take on it and get Erskine's take on it.
[01:49:54.637 --> 01:49:57.979]  And I want to throw some news items out at our guests as well.
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:03.303]  About many little robots, many robots in the trees watching you.
[01:50:03.343 --> 01:50:07.185]  This is out of the mainstream newspapers in Colorado.
[01:50:07.205 --> 01:50:09.967]  There are going to be little DARPA robots for your safety watching you.
[01:50:10.648 --> 01:50:11.488]  Isn't that freedom?
[01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:14.730]  The Army needs to write some fake letters for your local paper.
[01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:19.934]  That's the Army's job, is manipulating and planning false news stories.
[01:50:21.503 --> 01:50:22.143]  We're good to go.
[01:50:42.415 --> 01:50:43.376]  We're good to go.
[01:51:01.926 --> 01:51:03.967]  The elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:04.247 --> 01:51:09.768]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:52:21.004 --> 01:52:25.369]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:29.955]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:30.115 --> 01:52:34.481]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:52:34.541 --> 01:52:35.862]  The New World Order.
[01:52:36.623 --> 01:52:36.984]  Can emerge.
[01:52:37.665 --> 01:52:41.889]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:52:41.949 --> 01:52:48.897]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:52:49.017 --> 01:52:51.020]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:51.420 --> 01:53:01.768]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:53:02.008 --> 01:53:07.392]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:53:07.893 --> 01:53:10.535]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:53:10.655 --> 01:53:11.816]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:11.836 --> 01:53:12.276]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:53:12.296 --> 01:53:14.077]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:53:21.705 --> 01:53:27.308]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:29.649 --> 01:53:38.792]  Hey folks, if your station doesn't carry the third hour, they really should, because as usual, so much information ends up getting crammed into that hour.
[01:53:39.573 --> 01:53:46.976]  We're about to go to John and Spencer and Regina and Michael, and really that's going to be it for calls, because we've got to get to all this information.
[01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:52.713]  Before we go back to these calls, I want to throw this out to Robert Galen Ross and Erskine.
[01:53:53.454 --> 01:53:58.717]  Last week, NATO, and this was admitted, took over the city of Colorado Springs.
[01:53:58.737 --> 01:53:59.578]  We're on the radio there.
[01:54:01.272 --> 01:54:04.174]  And they made part of the city, some of the neighborhoods evacuate.
[01:54:04.834 --> 01:54:09.097]  Planes had problems with their avionics, hundreds and hundreds, and now it's upwards of a thousand.
[01:54:09.397 --> 01:54:20.924]  Garage door openers, doors at hospitals, touch pad doors, entry, keyless entry, red lights, cell phones, walkie-talkies.
[01:54:21.524 --> 01:54:23.205]  And then now they admit, I have the articles.
[01:54:23.245 --> 01:54:24.106]  I have dozens of these.
[01:54:24.146 --> 01:54:27.868]  We posted a bunch of them in a section on Infowars.com concerning this today.
[01:54:29.934 --> 01:54:38.901]  We already had a lot of this on Friday and Thursday, but then a lot of this news that came via callers, I then found news articles that did confirm all of it.
[01:54:39.181 --> 01:54:45.186]  They had troops out on the roads stopping families, searching cars, and it was under NATO control.
[01:54:45.947 --> 01:54:53.092]  How bad is it, or is it bad, to have a foreign military force taking over the city in a, quote, takeover drill?
[01:54:53.633 --> 01:54:55.354]  Robert and Erskine, comments.
[01:54:56.015 --> 01:54:57.976]  Well, really, it ought to be...
[01:54:59.249 --> 01:55:00.229]  Prohibited.
[01:55:00.349 --> 01:55:04.631]  The local sheriff should not allow this to go on.
[01:55:04.651 --> 01:55:06.992]  The local mayor should not allow it to go on.
[01:55:07.792 --> 01:55:17.115]  And it's just the elite using another technique to take over.
[01:55:18.595 --> 01:55:20.756]  But it's coming, and so look out for it.
[01:55:21.843 --> 01:55:25.687]  Well, yeah, it's all part of training us with all this urban warfare to go under military control.
[01:55:25.727 --> 01:55:36.199]  This weekend on my Saturday show with John Stoutmiller, I interviewed a fellow we're going to have back on the show who was in his deer stand on his property next to an Air National Guard base.
[01:55:36.539 --> 01:55:40.323]  Foreign British troops came on, said, get out of the tree under the Patriot Act.
[01:55:40.664 --> 01:55:41.885]  You can't be hunting here.
[01:55:42.719 --> 01:55:45.061]  But trespassing, folks, and I get these reports all the time.
[01:55:45.081 --> 01:55:46.122]  I've seen them in the newspaper.
[01:55:46.482 --> 01:55:47.383]  Erskine comments.
[01:55:48.043 --> 01:55:51.206]  Is Posse Comitatus completely gone or dead?
[01:55:51.486 --> 01:55:53.328]  If it isn't, it's certainly going away.
[01:55:53.408 --> 01:55:57.331]  I noticed this right after 9-1-1 on a trip to Vegas from Phoenix.
[01:55:57.731 --> 01:56:00.754]  I was going along the road, and we weren't pulled over by the military.
[01:56:01.114 --> 01:56:02.495]  It was the Park Service.
[01:56:02.635 --> 01:56:05.057]  I'm looking in the back window, and they said, where are you going?
[01:56:05.077 --> 01:56:05.818]  I said, to Vegas.
[01:56:05.838 --> 01:56:07.319]  They said, go ahead, have a great time.
[01:56:07.899 --> 01:56:11.563]  And I'm looking in the back window, and they've got these machine guns.
[01:56:11.623 --> 01:56:15.206]  And I'm thinking, Smokey Bear certainly has gotten vicious lately.
[01:56:15.246 --> 01:56:18.429]  And I'm looking at these guys with machine guns with the Park Service.
[01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:19.670]  We're under control.
[01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:21.692]  Like it or not, we are under control.
[01:56:21.752 --> 01:56:26.276]  Posse Comitatus has been skirted so far that it doesn't even exist anymore.
[01:56:26.376 --> 01:56:30.300]  Okay, I want to come back, take a few calls, and then get into the assassinations and some of the news.
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:33.523]  But right now, Erskine, Robert, both of you, plug your websites.
[01:56:35.094 --> 01:56:41.498]  My website is www.4rie.com.
[01:56:41.518 --> 01:56:44.800]  That's 4-R-I-E.com.
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:45.781]  4-R-I-E.com.
[01:56:45.861 --> 01:56:47.662]  And Erskine, your website?
[01:56:48.182 --> 01:56:50.664]  My website is erskineonradio.com.
[01:56:50.844 --> 01:56:53.326]  E-R-S-K-I-N-E on radio.com.
[01:56:53.366 --> 01:56:55.367]  Feel free to write me if you want to or anything.
[01:56:55.387 --> 01:56:58.969]  We have the guests listed up there and lots and lots of information.
[01:56:59.089 --> 01:57:01.331]  And your show is on Saturday into Sunday morning.
[01:57:01.371 --> 01:57:01.791]  What time?
[01:57:02.475 --> 01:57:13.784]  Saturday night, it's at 10 o'clock Pacific, noon on the Central Time Zone, where Alex is broadcasting from, and that is at midnight, rather, midnight Saturday night.
[01:57:13.864 --> 01:57:16.726]  So be sure to listen to, well, actually, no, it's 11 o'clock.
[01:57:16.806 --> 01:57:17.427]  It's 11, yeah, 11 to 4.
[01:57:17.487 --> 01:57:19.548]  So listen to Erskine on radio.com.
[01:57:21.167 --> 01:57:21.868]  It's a great show.
[01:57:21.908 --> 01:57:22.548]  We've got a break.
[01:57:22.608 --> 01:57:25.550]  I promise we'll go to four more calls when we get back quickly.
[01:57:26.111 --> 01:57:27.532]  And then straight into The Globalist.
[01:57:27.692 --> 01:57:45.644]  First, the power structure, how the New World Order is set up, who runs it, who's at the top of it, and then some examples of how ruthless they are and how they control organized crime and the intelligence agencies in the third hour of this October 13, 2003 global transmission against tyranny with Robert Gellin Ross and Erskine.
[01:57:46.044 --> 01:57:47.145]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:48.046 --> 01:57:49.187]  And I will get into this...
[01:57:51.059 --> 01:58:05.450]  Into this Colorado Daily article about the little robots that they're going to put over your cities and in the woods, and they're going to be on little lines, little cables zipping around watching you.
[01:58:05.710 --> 01:58:06.390]  Yes!
[01:58:07.171 --> 01:58:09.172]  Not just cameras now, but DARPA robots!
[01:58:11.590 --> 01:58:12.871]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:12.951 --> 01:58:14.031]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:58:39.688 --> 01:58:40.769]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:41.429 --> 01:58:42.250]  You want answers?
[01:58:43.010 --> 01:58:44.932]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:44.952 --> 01:58:48.194]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:48.774 --> 01:58:52.877]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:56.219 --> 01:58:56.719]  All right.
[01:58:57.500 --> 01:59:01.062]  On any one of these articles I've mentioned, I could spend three hours.
[01:59:02.723 --> 01:59:04.344]  I have articles out of the Olympian.
[01:59:04.364 --> 01:59:06.466]  I have articles out of the Associated Press.
[01:59:08.604 --> 01:59:22.394]  Hundreds of fake letters just around Washington State, at least 11 newspapers, have gotten multiple fake letters with the exact same words, the exact same word for word, with different signatures.
[01:59:23.295 --> 01:59:26.317]  And it's also, by the way, look at the signatures, it's the same handwriting.
[01:59:26.937 --> 01:59:34.723]  Different people's names, local military personnel's names, with form letters signed to it with the same handwriting all over the country.
[01:59:35.578 --> 01:59:37.359]  This is on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:59:38.139 --> 01:59:42.940]  Saying how wonderful the war is, how much they love it, how loving they are to the Iraqis, how high their morale is.
[01:59:43.821 --> 01:59:45.461]  This is just an incredible example.
[01:59:45.481 --> 02:00:00.046]  Then I've got an article here about DARPA with the EPA and the local environmental groups want to put micro-robots up around your cities and rural areas to go around on long lines between trees watching you with cameras and surveillance.
[02:00:01.347 --> 02:00:02.647]  I mean, that's right out of They Live.
[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:14.449]  And I hate to bring that bug up in this hour, because I want to go to a bunch of these calls and get into the history of the elite and some of the hits they've put out, but further comments on this Robert Galen Ross and Erskine before we go back to these calls.
[02:00:14.649 --> 02:00:27.579]  Well, there's one thing that is even more disturbing is they've created what they call nanobots, which they're smaller than the cross-section of human hair, and they can inject it into your blood, and it'll
[02:00:28.081 --> 02:00:36.688]  Remain dormant until they are sent an electronic signal and then we'll be awakened and we don't know what their assigned job is.
[02:00:36.928 --> 02:00:43.854]  Well, when we know in the 70s they were working on injections they could give somebody that would lay dormant until a certain frequency hit it and it would kill you.
[02:00:44.514 --> 02:00:47.217]  Go ahead and take your national compulsory vaccine, folks.
[02:00:47.777 --> 02:00:48.217]  That's right.
[02:00:49.298 --> 02:00:57.385]  But do a web search on nanobots and you'll see a lot of sites that talk about medical use of this.
[02:00:58.055 --> 02:01:02.437]  And so if they can use it for medical purposes, they can certainly use it to kill you.
[02:01:02.637 --> 02:01:09.460]  Well, we have a 73 plan of Kissinger ordering the third world to forcibly sterilize half their women or not get their World Bank IMF funding.
[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:14.422]  We have Ted Turner and Prince Philip and the rest of them saying they want to kill 80 to 95 percent of us.
[02:01:15.143 --> 02:01:17.043]  We have the Georgia Guidestones.
[02:01:17.103 --> 02:01:18.484]  This is what they're obsessed with.
[02:01:18.744 --> 02:01:19.524]  Erskine comments.
[02:01:20.125 --> 02:01:25.527]  You've got George Herbert Walker Bush, who on November the 11th, 1992, had this to say.
[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:32.262]  ...is more than one small country.
[02:01:33.443 --> 02:01:34.985]  It is a big idea.
[02:01:35.985 --> 02:01:37.066]  A new world order.
[02:01:37.407 --> 02:01:39.108]  They're telling you what they're up to.
[02:01:39.228 --> 02:01:43.792]  They are flat telling you what they're up to, and that's the same term that Adolf Hitler used.
[02:01:44.152 --> 02:01:47.035]  You don't think that this is conspiracy or it's nutcase?
[02:01:47.315 --> 02:01:50.958]  That George Herbert Walker Bush was right in there telling you what it's up to.
[02:01:51.238 --> 02:01:53.080]  These people aren't keeping it a secret.
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:56.703]  But Erskine, Erskine, they came right out.
[02:01:57.766 --> 02:02:04.569]  And said that in the FBI training manuals that anyone that believes in a New World Order is a delusional terrorist.
[02:02:05.449 --> 02:02:08.990]  Well, then that would class Mr. Bush because he's talking about it right there.
[02:02:11.151 --> 02:02:15.232]  Robert, I mean, how do they sit here and say there is no New World Order as they announce it out of their mouth?
[02:02:15.853 --> 02:02:25.076]  Well, in the video that I just produced, the American Union by 2005, I include a clip from C-SPAN where...
[02:02:26.316 --> 02:02:40.145]  Mike McCarty, the White House press counselor at the time, our president's counselor, said, we are not necessarily creating a new world order, but an order to a new world.
[02:02:40.925 --> 02:02:44.567]  An order to a new world, not a new world order.
[02:02:44.868 --> 02:02:45.108]  Right.
[02:02:45.548 --> 02:02:47.409]  Well, I've heard him say the global order.
[02:02:47.769 --> 02:02:52.372]  We must have a global system for our new world order.
[02:02:52.392 --> 02:02:53.773]  I mean, I've heard the president say that.
[02:02:55.663 --> 02:03:03.629]  And then also, Dick Cheney, the most important thing, Dick Cheney says they will create the free trade area of America by January 2005.
[02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:08.053]  That is the most important thing that we need to be looking at right now.
[02:03:08.433 --> 02:03:14.197]  All right, we'll come back, take four calls quickly, and we'll get into the assassinations in a nutshell and talk about the book and the film.
[02:03:14.978 --> 02:03:21.603]  And then I've got some other stuff coming up, and I will tell you about these little mini robots to watch you and keep track of you and your family, you know, because...
[02:03:22.492 --> 02:03:24.214]  It's for the environment now.
[02:03:24.254 --> 02:03:26.016]  The surveillance is for the earth.
[02:03:26.577 --> 02:03:30.722]  Just like they use the spy satellites to harass the farmers now here in the new global system.
[02:03:32.210 --> 02:03:39.017]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:03:39.358 --> 02:03:40.739]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:03:40.919 --> 02:03:43.122]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:03:43.282 --> 02:03:45.364]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:03:45.644 --> 02:03:50.589]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:50.910 --> 02:03:54.954]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:55.194 --> 02:03:55.814]  That's 888-2533-139 or order online
[02:04:25.133 --> 02:04:37.078]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:04:37.578 --> 02:04:40.719]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[02:04:41.368 --> 02:04:47.334]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[02:04:47.815 --> 02:04:51.438]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:04:51.879 --> 02:04:54.581]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[02:04:54.982 --> 02:04:58.785]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[02:04:59.226 --> 02:05:03.170]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the month that it aired.
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:04.020]  We're good to go.
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:04.461]  We're good to go.
[02:05:32.136 --> 02:05:33.737]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:34.117 --> 02:05:39.841]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:05:40.101 --> 02:05:45.225]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:05:45.585 --> 02:05:54.851]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:05:55.211 --> 02:06:00.153]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:06:00.473 --> 02:06:04.515]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:06:04.695 --> 02:06:09.457]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:06:09.837 --> 02:06:15.719]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:06:16.079 --> 02:06:25.107]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:06:25.307 --> 02:06:28.830]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:30.471]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:06:33.033 --> 02:06:35.235]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:06:35.795 --> 02:06:38.598]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:40.811 --> 02:06:50.039]  We're honored to have Robert Galen Ross, former NSA officer and great author, on with us, as well as Erskine, who has his own talk show here from 11 p.m.
[02:06:50.059 --> 02:06:52.501]  to, what, 3 or 4 a.m.
[02:06:52.541 --> 02:06:53.302]  every Saturday night.
[02:06:53.362 --> 02:06:55.003]  Erskine Overnight, great broadcast.
[02:06:55.103 --> 02:06:56.284]  Erskine on the radio.com.
[02:06:57.785 --> 02:06:59.547]  Give out their contact info before they leave us.
[02:07:00.067 --> 02:07:03.870]  We've got a lot to cover and a short time to get there, so let's go right to the callers.
[02:07:03.930 --> 02:07:06.873]  And gentlemen, you jump in any time to comment on what they have to say.
[02:07:07.915 --> 02:07:09.536]  Don in, I believe, Michigan.
[02:07:09.556 --> 02:07:10.137]  You're on the air.
[02:07:10.197 --> 02:07:10.577]  Go ahead.
[02:07:10.597 --> 02:07:11.137]  Hi, Alex.
[02:07:11.158 --> 02:07:12.018]  How are you doing today?
[02:07:12.198 --> 02:07:12.618]  Fine, sir.
[02:07:13.279 --> 02:07:15.320]  I've had better days and better times.
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:17.522]  Things are changing here in America and Michigan, too.
[02:07:18.502 --> 02:07:22.605]  I'm not going to go into a lot of detail, but this is probably the last time I'm going to call in and talk to you.
[02:07:22.625 --> 02:07:28.229]  I just want to let you know I really enjoy your show and your website, and I've really enjoyed the conversations, talking with you.
[02:07:28.949 --> 02:07:31.051]  But I might be going away.
[02:07:31.795 --> 02:07:34.236]  But I just wanted to let you know I really think you're awesome, buddy.
[02:07:34.677 --> 02:07:38.719]  Well, you guys are great up there, but what is the police state coming down on you there?
[02:07:38.739 --> 02:07:39.879]  A little bit.
[02:07:42.481 --> 02:07:47.424]  I know they're really targeting people all over the country right now, just people in the system, out of the system.
[02:07:48.304 --> 02:07:51.826]  Up in Michigan, they just got done killing some veteran with a bunch of tanks at his house.
[02:07:52.746 --> 02:07:54.747]  Yeah, you can probably read the press releases.
[02:07:54.808 --> 02:07:58.550]  It's in the Grand Rapids Press and every newspaper that's out there today.
[02:07:59.430 --> 02:08:01.071]  It's not me, it's people I know, but...
[02:08:02.173 --> 02:08:03.774]  It's just things are getting real hot.
[02:08:04.334 --> 02:08:07.276]  I just want to let you know that I really enjoyed listening to you and talking with you, buddy.
[02:08:07.576 --> 02:08:09.377]  Well, sir, we'll pray for you.
[02:08:09.857 --> 02:08:11.758]  Do you have any comments for our guest?
[02:08:12.359 --> 02:08:17.181]  Erskine and the other guy, you guys sound like you're really knowledgeable, and you're out there fighting a good fight.
[02:08:17.301 --> 02:08:17.681]  Keep it up.
[02:08:18.002 --> 02:08:19.442]  Yeah, I'm going to have to have them back on the show.
[02:08:19.502 --> 02:08:21.384]  Time just blasts by us.
[02:08:21.964 --> 02:08:23.164]  I know you've got other callers, Alex.
[02:08:23.184 --> 02:08:23.885]  Go ahead and get to them.
[02:08:23.945 --> 02:08:25.146]  I just wanted to tell you goodbye, buddy.
[02:08:25.166 --> 02:08:25.766]  Okay.
[02:08:25.806 --> 02:08:26.846]  Bless you and your talent.
[02:08:28.323 --> 02:08:29.784]  Wow, yeah.
[02:08:29.864 --> 02:08:30.745]  Take care, my friend.
[02:08:31.385 --> 02:08:33.387]  Let's talk to Spencer in Ohio.
[02:08:33.427 --> 02:08:34.308]  Spencer, you're on the air.
[02:08:34.328 --> 02:08:34.708]  Go ahead.
[02:08:35.409 --> 02:08:36.770]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:39.051]  Mr. Ross, I read your book.
[02:08:39.632 --> 02:08:45.596]  Could you tell me if William Cooper ever worked at the Dallas Trademark during the motorcade?
[02:08:46.177 --> 02:08:49.820]  And what did he know about the Kennedy assassination that got him shot down?
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:56.845]  And secondly, in Michael Collins Piper's book, Final Judgment, he alleges that Mr. Ruby is the smoking gun.
[02:08:58.580 --> 02:09:10.646]  Is that possible that he could have faked his death on the grounds that his autopsy photos were never released, his last will was never signed, and it was a closed casket affair and a very quick funeral?
[02:09:12.366 --> 02:09:15.048]  I'm afraid I don't have any details on either one of those.
[02:09:16.568 --> 02:09:25.392]  I just have to go on what they say, that Ruby died of cancer while in jail, and I don't have any other facts to change that.
[02:09:27.168 --> 02:09:34.532]  On the Cooper, Bill Cooper, I was at his funeral, and I don't think it was over what he had to say on the Kennedy assassination.
[02:09:34.952 --> 02:09:41.796]  It was over tax protests and a bunch of other things, but he certainly was taken out and assassinated, in my opinion.
[02:09:42.316 --> 02:09:47.099]  Yeah, he who lets will be, he'll let the New World Order happen until he'd be taken out of the way.
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:53.483]  Do you think our inspector should be given a polygraph exam to determine if he believes his own hoax?
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:56.821]  It certainly failed.
[02:09:57.161 --> 02:09:58.562]  Yeah, talking about the magic bullet.
[02:09:58.843 --> 02:10:00.264]  Thanks for the call there, Spencer.
[02:10:00.404 --> 02:10:02.265]  Regina in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:10:02.305 --> 02:10:02.706]  Go ahead.
[02:10:02.726 --> 02:10:12.474]  Speaking of Arlen Specter, Pat Toomey up here in Pennsylvania is running against Arlen Specter, and though I don't agree on everything he votes for, I think people better really look at him.
[02:10:12.954 --> 02:10:17.078]  Right now, you were talking, one of your speakers was there about UNESCO...
[02:10:17.611 --> 02:10:18.532]  We're good to go.
[02:10:18.572 --> 02:10:18.852]  I think?
[02:10:39.918 --> 02:10:52.049]  In regards to a $100 million grant coming to our county for a homeland security plan, the homeland security grant, this was a massive being involved with this meeting, Alex.
[02:10:52.450 --> 02:10:54.512]  Basically, it was a consensus meeting.
[02:10:54.532 --> 02:10:57.434]  We need 100% stakeholders to move the plan.
[02:10:57.754 --> 02:11:04.561]  We need the community to buy in, even though it was a pointed group of unelected officials mixed in with a couple of
[02:11:05.562 --> 02:11:07.684]  Go along, get along, elected officials.
[02:11:08.204 --> 02:11:10.866]  And we listened and weren't allowed to even say anything.
[02:11:11.166 --> 02:11:13.727]  I did go up to Congressman John Murphy, who was brought in to move it.
[02:11:13.747 --> 02:11:21.432]  Well, for those that don't know, what they do is, near Homeland Security, that means federalization, NORFCOM, dictatorship.
[02:11:22.213 --> 02:11:26.155]  NORFCOM, Homeland Security, the takeover of our local communities.
[02:11:26.415 --> 02:11:30.818]  Your comments, your analysis of that, Galen Ross and, of course, Erskine.
[02:11:31.298 --> 02:11:33.740]  It's just part of their police state.
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:35.921]  They're tightening up on the laws.
[02:11:36.001 --> 02:11:49.730]  They're gradually dissolving our rights, and the jackboot thugs will be ever more present in our communities.
[02:11:51.131 --> 02:11:53.873]  It's a major takeover scheme, and it's really happening.
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:12:01.686]  I think, really, Don had quite a bit to say that caller Alex, and if you listen to him, you can see, well, this is playing out.
[02:12:01.746 --> 02:12:12.035]  And to the caller who's on there right now, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have been doing a research project and have issued a joint recommendation on Internet licensing
[02:12:12.535 --> 02:12:19.660]  And this is very broad support in Congress, not simply requiring licenses for vendors or those who have websites.
[02:12:19.940 --> 02:12:21.981]  They're talking about people who surf the net.
[02:12:22.001 --> 02:12:25.043]  They're going to have to have a license in order to surf the net.
[02:12:25.063 --> 02:12:28.386]  You have to log in and put in your federal license number.
[02:12:28.426 --> 02:12:29.647]  Talk about restricting.
[02:12:29.687 --> 02:12:33.509]  They've got most of the radio stations, the TV stations, the newspapers.
[02:12:33.889 --> 02:12:37.812]  And by the way, Erskine, under the Patriot Act,
[02:12:38.587 --> 02:12:39.668]  And then thanks for the call, Regina.
[02:12:39.688 --> 02:12:40.169]  Thank you much.
[02:12:40.409 --> 02:12:40.769]  You bet.
[02:12:40.889 --> 02:12:48.156]  Under the Patriot Act, any violation of any Internet law they have is an act of hacking punishable by life in prison or execution.
[02:12:48.556 --> 02:12:52.340]  So now, not following all this taxation and rules, you'll be a terrorist.
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:56.043]  I mean, it's like Orrin Hatch saying, destroy somebody's computer by remote control.
[02:12:56.063 --> 02:12:57.104]  They download something.
[02:12:58.425 --> 02:13:07.189]  And they can brand you enemy combatant, and then you'll be tried in military tribunals and not subject to civil or criminal courts.
[02:13:07.409 --> 02:13:10.290]  One last call, and then we're getting to the assassinations in the time we've got left.
[02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:11.291]  Michael in New York.
[02:13:11.331 --> 02:13:11.731]  Go ahead.
[02:13:12.591 --> 02:13:13.172]  Yeah, hello, Alex.
[02:13:13.192 --> 02:13:13.612]  How you doing?
[02:13:14.092 --> 02:13:14.352]  Good.
[02:13:15.533 --> 02:13:17.914]  I have a little bit of a story about the police state.
[02:13:18.094 --> 02:13:20.575]  Actually, something that happened to me, actually, recently.
[02:13:20.595 --> 02:13:21.475]  I mean, the last month.
[02:13:22.696 --> 02:13:26.538]  I was traveling down in North Carolina, and I was traveling up...
[02:13:28.644 --> 02:13:31.206]  I-85, and around Davidson County.
[02:13:31.946 --> 02:13:34.668]  I passed two cops, you know, sitting on the side of the road with their lights on.
[02:13:34.728 --> 02:13:36.909]  And I passed them, and then I wasn't speeding.
[02:13:37.269 --> 02:13:37.790]  I keep going.
[02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:41.652]  And then maybe like a minute or two later, I see them come up behind me with their lights on.
[02:13:41.712 --> 02:13:43.613]  And I was actually getting off to get gas.
[02:13:43.873 --> 02:13:44.654]  They needed to get gas.
[02:13:45.334 --> 02:13:46.034]  They pulled me over.
[02:13:46.054 --> 02:13:49.156]  They pulled me over and pulled over at the exit ramp.
[02:13:50.337 --> 02:13:50.457]  And...
[02:13:51.946 --> 02:13:53.747]  You know, the guy comes out of his car.
[02:13:53.948 --> 02:13:58.211]  But the thing is, he comes with his flashlight, and he comes to the passenger side window, not the driver's side.
[02:13:58.231 --> 02:14:00.313]  He doesn't want to roll out my window.
[02:14:01.314 --> 02:14:06.137]  And then he asked me just for my driver's license and registration and insurance card.
[02:14:07.198 --> 02:14:07.599]  That's it.
[02:14:08.319 --> 02:14:09.780]  I asked him why I was being pulled over.
[02:14:10.081 --> 02:14:16.886]  I had to ask him three times until he finally said that I was being pulled over for my license plate light being out.
[02:14:17.066 --> 02:14:19.268]  And there was two cops pulling me over.
[02:14:20.188 --> 02:14:23.309]  Well, that's been going on for 30 years, just randomly pulling people over.
[02:14:23.529 --> 02:14:24.030]  This is funny.
[02:14:24.050 --> 02:14:32.113]  They actually eventually told me to get out of the car for unknown reasons.
[02:14:32.133 --> 02:14:33.794]  And then I actually got to see them.
[02:14:34.454 --> 02:14:35.274]  And you know what they look like?
[02:14:35.294 --> 02:14:39.456]  They look like good old SWAT team members with their baseball caps and their...
[02:14:40.345 --> 02:14:41.666]  The jacked boots and everything.
[02:14:42.247 --> 02:14:43.928]  And so they tried to search your vehicle, huh?
[02:14:44.308 --> 02:14:45.710]  They almost tried to search me, Alex.
[02:14:45.730 --> 02:14:48.752]  They pulled my hands on the back of the trunk.
[02:14:48.952 --> 02:14:49.973]  So that's the new America.
[02:14:49.993 --> 02:14:51.394]  You just can't even drive down the road.
[02:14:51.514 --> 02:14:54.297]  All it says is sheriff on their uniforms.
[02:14:54.357 --> 02:15:04.866]  I asked them about what you were saying in one of your videos, the Police State 2 video, about the badge number supposed to be visible.
[02:15:04.906 --> 02:15:06.327]  Most states have that law.
[02:15:07.408 --> 02:15:08.529]  I asked them that, and he said there's...
[02:15:09.739 --> 02:15:10.840]  That's the new uniform, really.
[02:15:11.561 --> 02:15:15.785]  Yeah, so no more badge numbers, identification, secret police, another hallmark of freedom.
[02:15:16.125 --> 02:15:22.751]  Everything our veterans fight for is so the government can write fake letters saying the troops love everything and so SWAT teams can shove you and your family around.
[02:15:22.771 --> 02:15:23.292]  Thanks for the call.
[02:15:24.013 --> 02:15:24.833]  Appreciate the call.
[02:15:25.274 --> 02:15:26.495]  Gentlemen, comments to what he just said.
[02:15:26.515 --> 02:15:29.178]  Then I want to shift gears real quick into the assassinations.
[02:15:31.079 --> 02:15:31.540]  Go ahead, Archie.
[02:15:32.259 --> 02:15:36.683]  Well, I think things like this have been happening in the South for a long time.
[02:15:36.703 --> 02:15:43.528]  He had New York plates on, so I think I'll be a little bit suspicious, but the fact of the matter is, what he's describing is your police state.
[02:15:43.628 --> 02:15:47.351]  It's coming to a neighborhood near you, so gird your loins.
[02:15:47.431 --> 02:15:48.312]  It's coming at you.
[02:15:50.533 --> 02:15:54.737]  Now, we've got about, I don't know, about ten minutes left of air time with you guys.
[02:15:55.197 --> 02:16:00.201]  Robert Galen Ross, I know you've got some clips, too, so we may hold you a little bit over in the next segment if you can.
[02:16:01.535 --> 02:16:10.281]  Just in a nutshell, if you've got ten minutes to tell people about these assassinations, the evidence in your book, elite serial killers, lay it out for us, Robert.
[02:16:12.183 --> 02:16:29.755]  Unless you've read my book, you don't know that there was a meeting at Clint Murchison's house off Preston Avenue in North Dallas the night before JFK was killed, and the purpose of the meeting was to cover up all the evidence and make sure that they had all the evidence
[02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:43.358]  ...facts under control the next day of the killing, and there are 25 people attended this private meeting, and just go over the names, Clint Markson, H.L.
[02:16:43.478 --> 02:16:58.727]  Hunt, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, John J. McCloy, J. Edgar Hoover, Clint Tolson, and also we got Carlos Marcello,
[02:16:59.755 --> 02:17:06.171]  And Joe Cervelo, mafia people, are sitting at the same table with the FBI leaders today.
[02:17:06.710 --> 02:17:09.791]  Talking about the cover-up, the killing that's going to take place the next day.
[02:17:10.051 --> 02:17:14.031]  By the way, the same FBI head that said that the organized crime didn't exist.
[02:17:14.051 --> 02:17:19.492]  Just like the New World Order didn't exist, organized crime doesn't exist, but Cosa Nostra is a made-up word.
[02:17:19.852 --> 02:17:26.454]  Yeah, Hoover said that several times on national television at Senate hearings.
[02:17:26.474 --> 02:17:30.354]  He said that there's no such thing as Cosa Nostra or mafia.
[02:17:31.114 --> 02:17:32.355]  And he's in bed with them.
[02:17:34.015 --> 02:17:34.155]  But...
[02:17:35.482 --> 02:17:46.106]  Also, John Connolly attended that meeting, and he knew that there was going to be a shooting the next day, but he didn't know that they were also going to try to kill him.
[02:17:46.906 --> 02:17:57.771]  And in my book, I give the details of a 15-person death squad that was there at Deedee Plaza to kill Kennedy and also...
[02:17:59.332 --> 02:18:05.893]  One of the guys on the 64, Malcolm E. Mack Wallace, his job was to kill John Connolly, but Connolly didn't know that.
[02:18:06.814 --> 02:18:10.735]  And he was almost successful, but Connolly did live over it.
[02:18:11.495 --> 02:18:14.215]  But Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy.
[02:18:14.295 --> 02:18:16.116]  He didn't have a gun in his hand that day.
[02:18:17.196 --> 02:18:22.897]  Sirhan Sirhan did not kill Bobby Kennedy and James Earl Ray.
[02:18:22.917 --> 02:18:25.638]  We're going to go over when we get back with Erskine and Robert Galen Ross.
[02:18:25.678 --> 02:18:26.438]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:18:27.253 --> 02:18:28.561]  We'll give out their websites as well.
[02:18:28.621 --> 02:18:29.767]  My site's Infowars.com.
[02:18:32.535 --> 02:18:33.095]  We're good to go.
[02:18:58.531 --> 02:19:00.452]  You'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[02:19:32.378 --> 02:19:35.860]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:39.623]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:19:39.703 --> 02:19:43.645]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:19:43.865 --> 02:19:50.029]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:19:50.450 --> 02:19:58.355]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:19:58.775 --> 02:20:04.118]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:20:04.258 --> 02:20:08.040]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:08.401 --> 02:20:10.262]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:20:10.322 --> 02:20:12.483]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:20:12.723 --> 02:20:17.986]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:20:18.026 --> 02:20:23.249]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:20:32.153 --> 02:20:36.874]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:20:37.155 --> 02:20:37.835]  Yes, it's true.
[02:20:37.915 --> 02:20:40.616]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:20:40.756 --> 02:20:44.777]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[02:20:44.877 --> 02:20:45.437]  You heard it right.
[02:20:45.597 --> 02:20:50.619]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.

[02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.330]  I think.
[02:22:03.618 --> 02:22:04.018]  We're good to go.
[02:22:04.038 --> 02:22:04.598]  We're good to go.
[02:22:39.082 --> 02:22:41.643]  Alright my friends, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:22:41.683 --> 02:22:45.745]  We're talking to Robert Galen Ross and of course Erskine of Erskine Overnight with his own talk show on this network.
[02:22:46.945 --> 02:22:57.630]  Robert, continuing with your bullet point analysis, and again you document all this, and there's so much evidence on every point you're making it would take hours to cover even one point.
[02:22:58.702 --> 02:23:01.104]  But continuing, why did they kill Kennedy?
[02:23:01.124 --> 02:23:05.407]  There's a lot of reasons, but both you guys give us the reasons for why they went after him.
[02:23:05.607 --> 02:23:26.401]  The real reason to kill Kennedy is because on June 4, 1963, he signed Executive Order 11110, instructing the Treasury Department to print silver certificates, and they actually printed about $4.3 billion worth of silver certificates, redeemable in silver,
[02:23:27.319 --> 02:23:33.342]  At any bank, in direct competition with the Federal Reserve, that's a real reason that Kennedy was killed.
[02:23:34.603 --> 02:23:41.486]  By the way, I own three of those $5 bills that say not at state's note, not Federal Reserve note.
[02:23:41.806 --> 02:23:42.647]  This is the big question.
[02:23:42.747 --> 02:23:45.809]  Why did he say he was getting rid of the CIA, that he was getting out of Vietnam?
[02:23:45.829 --> 02:23:46.649]  Because he's been a hawk.
[02:23:47.532 --> 02:23:48.312]  Yeah, he was... You know, if...
[02:24:13.999 --> 02:24:37.840]  If he and his brother Bobby and Martin Luther King had lived, the entire world would be much better off today because John F. Kennedy was going to trash the Federal Reserve System, bring the right to print money back under the Congress, as it states in the Constitution, and he was going to scatter the CIA to the winds.
[02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:39.101]  He had already issued orders
[02:24:39.733 --> 02:24:41.354]  Pull the troops out of Vietnam.
[02:24:41.574 --> 02:24:43.074]  And this was even in the newspapers.
[02:24:43.274 --> 02:24:43.614]  Yes.
[02:24:44.135 --> 02:24:45.775]  Erskine, you've got some other points, too.
[02:24:46.455 --> 02:24:49.717]  Well, he was going to retire J. Edgar Hoover, which was a major point.
[02:24:49.757 --> 02:24:52.357]  That's one of the reasons that Hoover was there at that meeting.
[02:24:52.678 --> 02:24:54.638]  He was going to drop LBJ.
[02:24:54.978 --> 02:25:07.783]  And let's not forget another point that Mr. Ross brings up in his book, The Elite Serial Killers, is that Lyndon was listening to the shooters while they were going down the street there at Dealey Plaza on a walkie-talkie.
[02:25:08.343 --> 02:25:14.567]  And he also had the attack on the mob by Robert Kennedy, the people who put him in, the Sam Giancana mob out of Chicago.
[02:25:15.007 --> 02:25:21.251]  He was going to void oil depletion allowances, normalize relations with Cuba.
[02:25:21.471 --> 02:25:22.411]  But here's the question.
[02:25:22.592 --> 02:25:24.072]  Why did he do all that?
[02:25:26.654 --> 02:25:27.915]  Why did Kennedy do all that?
[02:25:27.935 --> 02:25:30.056]  Why did Kennedy go against the New World Order?
[02:25:30.096 --> 02:25:30.796]  We know he did.
[02:25:30.896 --> 02:25:31.117]  Why?
[02:25:31.137 --> 02:25:31.797]  I want your opinion.
[02:25:32.709 --> 02:25:34.912]  I believe that he saw what was happening.
[02:25:34.952 --> 02:25:36.594]  He saw the takeover of America.
[02:25:36.694 --> 02:25:38.676]  I believe that he just couldn't abide by it.
[02:25:38.716 --> 02:25:41.279]  Plus, he was sold down the river with the Bay of Pigs.
[02:25:41.599 --> 02:25:43.141]  He knew he couldn't trust these people.
[02:25:43.401 --> 02:25:53.533]  Also, he gave a speech a few weeks before his murder at American University talking about a great global crime syndicate, an evil that had taken America over that he was going to expose.
[02:25:53.593 --> 02:25:53.833]  Robert?
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:59.983]  And that's the elite, or the globalists, or the New World Order group that he was talking about.
[02:26:00.103 --> 02:26:11.210]  And he was aware of it, and so they couldn't allow him to live because he was going to really cause major interference in their global takeover plan.
[02:26:12.831 --> 02:26:14.772]  Now, who runs the New World Order, Robert?
[02:26:15.972 --> 02:26:19.655]  It's actually the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[02:26:19.675 --> 02:26:23.197]  David Rockefeller is an agent of the Rothschilds, but it's the...
[02:26:24.136 --> 02:26:32.800]  I think there's four or five guys in the Rothschilds, and I'm not sure who heads it up, whether it's Evelyn or Jacob.
[02:26:33.461 --> 02:26:35.622]  From all indicators, it's Jacob.
[02:26:36.422 --> 02:26:37.823]  It's really hard to tell.
[02:26:37.863 --> 02:26:43.286]  The Rothschild from Paris is going to be taking over N.M.
[02:26:43.326 --> 02:26:45.547]  Rothschild from Evelyn.
[02:26:47.068 --> 02:26:53.831]  I really haven't been able to pin down who the real leader is, but there's always one leader of the Rothschilds, and they all work
[02:26:54.529 --> 02:26:55.450]  In unison.
[02:26:55.470 --> 02:27:00.334]  And then they've got councils under them with the Oppenheimers and the Crumps and all the other families.
[02:27:00.434 --> 02:27:01.035]  That's correct.
[02:27:01.795 --> 02:27:03.216]  Here's one that blew me away.
[02:27:03.336 --> 02:27:06.379]  Robert, how much money do you figure that the Rothschilds have?
[02:27:06.679 --> 02:27:11.283]  Somewhere between 100 and 500 trillion, with a T, trillion dollars.
[02:27:11.503 --> 02:27:29.351]  Well, the Russians, their top economist, Tanya Karajanian, Dr. Tanya Karajanian, said that it's a 300 trillion, quote, skull death group that calls themselves the skull death group, you know, skull and bones, again, but on a wider scale, and she talked about 9-11 about to happen.
[02:27:30.737 --> 02:27:39.908]  Well, and the Rockefeller family in 1998 was worth $11.48 trillion, and that's not reported in Forbes magazine.
[02:27:40.368 --> 02:27:42.731]  Well, they, quote, got their trust busted up.
[02:27:42.811 --> 02:27:44.053]  No, they just went tax-free in 1906.
[02:27:44.994 --> 02:27:47.757]  And then they changed the names of the company.
[02:27:47.797 --> 02:27:50.079]  They're still owned by the banks.
[02:27:51.036 --> 02:27:53.878]  And which are owned by the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[02:27:54.218 --> 02:27:58.220]  Tell you what, guys, let's do five more minutes on the other side because I want to plug the radio show for Erskine.
[02:27:58.260 --> 02:28:00.661]  I want to talk about a little bit more with you.
[02:28:00.681 --> 02:28:01.742]  And we've got another guest coming on.
[02:28:01.782 --> 02:28:09.025]  And I will get, I will spend a couple minutes on this Colorado news story about the little robots that are going to watch you for your new safety.
[02:28:09.086 --> 02:28:16.449]  Yes, yes, not just blimps, not just echelon, not just ground-penetrating radar on the helicopters, not just the drones.
[02:28:16.529 --> 02:28:18.591]  And now we're going to have the little robots.
[02:28:18.631 --> 02:28:19.291]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:22.572 --> 02:28:23.472]  We're on the march.
[02:28:23.973 --> 02:28:25.573]  The empire's on the run.
[02:28:26.494 --> 02:28:29.295]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:32.616 --> 02:28:33.376]  Oh my God!
[02:28:33.657 --> 02:28:38.378]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:28:38.659 --> 02:28:39.319]  Yes, it's true.
[02:28:39.419 --> 02:28:42.100]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:46.282]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[02:28:46.382 --> 02:28:46.942]  You heard it right.
[02:28:47.102 --> 02:28:52.124]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[02:28:52.244 --> 02:28:52.665]  We're good to go.
[02:29:08.985 --> 02:29:09.585]  We're good to go.
[02:29:32.897 --> 02:29:43.620]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:51.382]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:51.622 --> 02:29:52.964]  The system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:30:07.598 --> 02:30:11.481]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:30:11.541 --> 02:30:13.423]  The water level is always visible.
[02:30:13.603 --> 02:30:19.547]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:30:19.787 --> 02:30:23.490]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:24.011]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:30:32.757 --> 02:30:41.620]  You are sick because you allow yourself to remain sick and you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw food.
[02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:43.161]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[02:30:43.321 --> 02:30:47.322]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[02:30:47.502 --> 02:30:53.304]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[02:30:53.844 --> 02:30:56.086]  The two most complete protein superfoods known.
[02:30:56.446 --> 02:30:58.908]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water.
[02:30:59.228 --> 02:31:06.372]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you to homeostasis.
[02:31:06.673 --> 02:31:10.335]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[02:31:10.615 --> 02:31:13.176]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[02:31:13.457 --> 02:31:18.439]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.
[02:31:18.719 --> 02:31:19.880]  Weekday mornings at 9 a.m.
[02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:20.260]  Central.
[02:31:20.420 --> 02:31:21.301]  Call 1-888-826-4448 to learn more.
[02:31:21.321 --> 02:31:23.562]  That's 1-888-826-4448 or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[02:31:41.144 --> 02:31:44.685]  The global surveillance grid is almost total.
[02:31:46.085 --> 02:31:51.647]  And they've said that they want to have humans off about 80% of the land in this country and globally.
[02:31:52.087 --> 02:32:01.509]  In fact, I read National Geographic magazine articles three years ago where it shows UN troops guarding the forest in Burma where they've driven, by the way, and killed the natives.
[02:32:03.003 --> 02:32:05.806]  And then, of course, later the corporations move in and cut down all the timber.
[02:32:05.946 --> 02:32:08.227]  But, of course, it's for the environment that they do all this.
[02:32:08.868 --> 02:32:18.055]  Well, now DARPA, and that's who's funded this, and I have the Colorado Daily News article here, has funded hundreds of robots to be put into the forest on little cables.
[02:32:18.935 --> 02:32:20.877]  And they have video, audio, sensors.
[02:32:20.897 --> 02:32:23.078]  They're there to watch you and make sure you're not hurting anything.
[02:32:23.579 --> 02:32:27.241]  See, wiring the woods in case you try to get out into the total control.
[02:32:27.362 --> 02:32:29.003]  I will cover this before this show ends.
[02:32:29.691 --> 02:32:30.972]  I'd like to ask you a question there, Alex.
[02:32:52.921 --> 02:32:58.126]  Now, Robert has a book out that lists all the members of the Bilderbergers, the Trilateralists, and the CFR.
[02:32:58.186 --> 02:33:01.329]  He's got Dan Rather, he's got Peter Jinks, he's got Diane Sawyer.
[02:33:01.569 --> 02:33:02.470]  Where are you and I?
[02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:03.971]  Why are we not listed, huh?
[02:33:04.872 --> 02:33:08.395]  Well, I guess we're not willing to sell out our fellow human beings for total enslavement.
[02:33:09.235 --> 02:33:10.416]  You got that one right.
[02:33:10.556 --> 02:33:22.672]  But that book lists all the... And you will be surprised, America, when you see the number of people who you, quote, turn to for, quote, news, and all these people are all members of these...
[02:33:23.513 --> 02:33:26.374]  CFR, Trilateralist, and the Bilderbergs.
[02:33:26.454 --> 02:33:27.694]  They're all members of that.
[02:33:28.015 --> 02:33:33.056]  Most of the news media is a member in good standing of these organizations.
[02:33:33.517 --> 02:33:40.299]  And those who aren't willing to sell out, like Alex and myself, the few who aren't, you better be supporting Alex Jones.
[02:33:40.399 --> 02:33:43.280]  Well, gentlemen, we've only got a few minutes left here, and I really appreciate you coming on.
[02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:45.521]  I'm going to get you both back on here real soon.
[02:33:45.581 --> 02:33:49.642]  But in a nutshell, from a minute from both of you, what are solutions?
[02:33:49.962 --> 02:33:51.103]  How do we defeat this thing?
[02:33:51.183 --> 02:33:52.223]  Can we defeat this thing?
[02:33:52.774 --> 02:34:00.216]  Well, first of all, we need to support people like you and Erskine that are trying to get the truth out.
[02:34:00.776 --> 02:34:16.779]  And we need to, anytime there's an election, we hope that there will be an independent person running for office and vote for the independent person of your choice so that we can eliminate the two-party system and gradually get control of our government back under the citizens.
[02:34:17.079 --> 02:34:19.059]  I would say local government's the place to start.
[02:34:19.499 --> 02:34:19.739]  Yes.
[02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:22.340]  Solutions, Erskine.
[02:34:23.192 --> 02:34:23.332]  Yes.
[02:34:23.392 --> 02:34:23.513]  Yes.
[02:34:23.693 --> 02:34:23.793]  Yes.
[02:34:38.291 --> 02:34:39.072]  You guys are great.
[02:34:39.092 --> 02:34:42.734]  I am going to have to have you back on because we just ran out of time here.
[02:35:04.610 --> 02:35:08.473]  Robert, phone numbers, websites, mailing addresses, and same to Erskine.
[02:35:08.814 --> 02:35:10.876]  Okay, the toll-free number is 800-410-5571.
[02:35:10.956 --> 02:35:11.116]  That's 410-5571.
[02:35:11.176 --> 02:35:13.979]  And the website is www.4rie.com.
[02:35:14.659 --> 02:35:15.720]  That's 4-R-I-E.com.
[02:35:29.574 --> 02:35:31.995]  The number for RIE.com.
[02:35:32.255 --> 02:35:34.295]  Okay, and Erskine, your website again.
[02:35:34.835 --> 02:35:41.177]  The program on Erskine Overnight is on 9 o'clock Pacific Time, 11 p.m.
[02:35:41.477 --> 02:35:49.439]  Saturday nights, Central Time, Erskine on Radio.com, www.erskineonradio.com.
[02:35:49.759 --> 02:35:55.220]  If the station's not carrying it, ask them to, and be sure and get a copy of The Elite Serial Killers.
[02:35:55.540 --> 02:35:58.321]  This book will open your eyes, and the videos that...
[02:35:59.002 --> 02:35:59.722]  You have, Alex.
[02:35:59.962 --> 02:36:02.583]  Those videos are absolute dynamite.
[02:36:02.623 --> 02:36:04.003]  They are a real thorn.
[02:36:04.503 --> 02:36:05.003]  Well, thank you.
[02:36:05.063 --> 02:36:07.924]  Folks are missing out if they don't tune into your broadcast as well, Erskine.
[02:36:07.964 --> 02:36:09.284]  Thank you both, gentlemen, for coming on.
[02:36:09.304 --> 02:36:10.425]  We'll get you back on in the future.
[02:36:10.705 --> 02:36:11.605]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:36:12.145 --> 02:36:12.925]  God bless, gentlemen.
[02:36:12.985 --> 02:36:13.825]  Thank you so much.
[02:36:13.885 --> 02:36:18.166]  Now, I've got a few final news stories I'm going to hit before this show ends.
[02:36:18.186 --> 02:36:22.667]  But right now, and I appreciate him holding the last seven minutes, is Jim Shepard.
[02:36:22.907 --> 02:36:25.448]  And we talk about taking control of our lives.
[02:36:27.179 --> 02:36:27.880]  We're good to go.
[02:36:52.527 --> 02:36:53.448]  We're good to go.
[02:37:14.153 --> 02:37:16.935]  I'm sorry, I don't have any magic cures or snake oil for you.
[02:37:17.275 --> 02:37:23.240]  Just good, clean water without the fluoride, the chloride, the MBTE, the herbicides, the pesticides.
[02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:26.082]  It's real, it's simple, the water of life.
[02:37:26.202 --> 02:37:28.524]  Jim Shepard, thanks for coming on with us today.
[02:37:28.904 --> 02:37:30.425]  Always a pleasure to be with you, Alex.
[02:37:31.426 --> 02:37:39.913]  Alex, when we introduced these, one of the calls that we really weren't expecting was from a lot of elderly people who had called us up and said...
[02:37:40.819 --> 02:37:50.766]  You know, I've been buying bottled water all these years, and the reason I didn't get a water filter is because they were just so complex, didn't understand them, they installed them under the sink, you're supposed to check the filters.
[02:37:51.406 --> 02:37:57.991]  Thank you so much for giving us a water filter that is so simple, and it's so simple to understand and so simple to use.
[02:37:58.531 --> 02:37:59.952]  This is what we've been looking for.
[02:38:00.532 --> 02:38:04.135]  And really, Alex, that's the way we designed these, is to be real simple,
[02:38:04.773 --> 02:38:12.261]  And, you know, you don't have to come up with a system that has all these tubes and wires and everything else to filter the water.
[02:38:13.442 --> 02:38:17.466]  We do it the same way that, you know, God created the earth to do it.
[02:38:18.247 --> 02:38:26.015]  And, you know, you can take dirty, nasty water and it'll seep down into the aquifers and the sand in the beds.
[02:38:26.853 --> 02:38:28.395]  I think so.
[02:38:42.361 --> 02:38:48.989]  And duplicate the way the good Lord created Earth to naturally filter water, and that is what the Berkey is.
[02:38:49.289 --> 02:38:57.119]  Now, Queen Elizabeth, over 100 years ago, gave the inventor of the British Berkey a big award, and now it's the choice of missionaries and militaries.
[02:38:57.199 --> 02:39:02.285]  There's hundreds of these now being used by the troops that are trucking water in under Halliburton contracts.
[02:39:03.106 --> 02:39:05.989]  I mean, this is the unit.
[02:39:06.069 --> 02:39:08.052]  I bought one of these four or five years ago now.
[02:39:08.172 --> 02:39:09.273]  I've got three of them now.
[02:39:09.333 --> 02:39:10.535]  I've got your sports bottles.
[02:39:10.615 --> 02:39:12.637]  My wife takes it with her when she goes to the gym.
[02:39:13.098 --> 02:39:15.020]  She puts the water fountain water in there.
[02:39:15.501 --> 02:39:17.263]  Once you've been drinking out of a big Berkey,
[02:39:18.087 --> 02:39:23.988]  Okay, which is a lot more economical than similar units that will do the same thing, cost thousands of dollars.
[02:39:24.448 --> 02:39:29.129]  This is the preeminent system, and Jim was such a huge distributor for this.
[02:39:29.169 --> 02:39:31.470]  He got it moved right here to the U.S.
[02:39:31.510 --> 02:39:32.730]  He makes the Berkey light.
[02:39:33.690 --> 02:39:41.071]  This thing is even more powerful if it's possible, because before it would cut everything out with the fluoride, because fluoride is designed to go right through everything.
[02:39:41.231 --> 02:39:41.952]  It's just amazing.
[02:39:42.252 --> 02:39:43.992]  He's got post filters that do that, too.
[02:39:44.781 --> 02:39:47.946]  Just please, number one, this is important for the country.
[02:39:47.966 --> 02:39:49.529]  Number two, it supports this broadcast.
[02:39:50.250 --> 02:39:54.076]  Jim is basically totally responsible for funding our global outreach on Shortwave.
[02:39:54.637 --> 02:39:57.381]  And so when you do this, you also support us waking up the world.
[02:39:58.343 --> 02:39:59.465]  I want everybody...
[02:40:00.086 --> 02:40:04.330]  The call today, tonight, and if the operators are busy, leave your name and number, they'll call you right back.
[02:40:04.850 --> 02:40:06.492]  And I want you to not procrastinate.
[02:40:06.612 --> 02:40:08.454]  I want you to take advantage of these specials they've got.
[02:40:08.814 --> 02:40:09.955]  Now, there's a bunch of different products.
[02:40:09.975 --> 02:40:18.603]  They've got an amazing solar charger and adapter that charges up the emergency lighting system that goes on the new Berkey light, perfect for field use or beautiful for your home.
[02:40:19.458 --> 02:40:21.640]  Just an amazing system.
[02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:28.145]  They've got the new filters, the new black filters, if you want to replace the older white filters if you bought a Berkey five years ago or so.
[02:40:28.905 --> 02:40:35.370]  They've got so many different items, shower filters where you're absorbing most of the poisons, even if you're drinking filtered water.
[02:40:36.111 --> 02:40:38.773]  It's come out that the bottled water, most of the companies aren't safe.
[02:40:38.853 --> 02:40:42.976]  Dannon Water got people killed up in New York a couple years ago, according to the Associated Press.
[02:40:43.796 --> 02:40:45.416]  This is so important, folks.
[02:40:45.436 --> 02:40:51.437]  You want to take control of your life, stop drinking tap water, stop absorbing the deadly poisons they put in it.
[02:40:51.777 --> 02:40:53.078]  We've had top scientists on.
[02:40:53.118 --> 02:40:53.838]  It's now admitted.
[02:40:54.218 --> 02:40:55.398]  Jim, tell them about the specials.
[02:40:56.018 --> 02:41:00.119]  Well, this month, Alex, we really want to focus on the shower filters.
[02:41:00.139 --> 02:41:12.281]  You know, a lot of people have cleaned up their drinking water, but many people do not realize that you actually get more contamination from taking a shower than you do from having the chemicals in your drinking water.
[02:41:12.799 --> 02:41:15.741]  We've got a special up on your site, and folks can go to InfoWars.com.
[02:41:39.796 --> 02:41:43.379]  And we're going to do the Berkey light with white or blue lights.
[02:41:43.519 --> 02:41:45.641]  The white is great for camping in emergencies.
[02:41:45.681 --> 02:41:49.084]  The blue is great if you just want to wow your friends because it's gorgeous.
[02:41:50.045 --> 02:41:54.649]  And we also are going to include the Berkey solar charger.
[02:41:55.189 --> 02:41:57.011]  And this is so you have perpetual lighting.
[02:41:57.051 --> 02:42:03.236]  You can charge them during the day if you have an emergency, the lights, and then you run them all night and you'd never run out of energy.
[02:42:04.253 --> 02:42:12.618]  You can also use that solar charger to charge cell phones, and we've got a bunch of adapters on there so you can run radios with it and everything else.
[02:42:13.319 --> 02:42:14.600]  And it's book-sized.
[02:42:14.780 --> 02:42:18.362]  It's great for a glove compartment or a go bag.
[02:42:18.402 --> 02:42:19.863]  It'll fit inside there.
[02:42:20.643 --> 02:42:25.606]  And then we're also going to include the KDF shower filter so we can clean up that shower water.
[02:42:26.087 --> 02:42:31.370]  We're also going to include a battery adapter, and the battery adapter on a set of four...
[02:42:32.085 --> 02:42:32.746]  This is LED, too.
[02:42:32.826 --> 02:42:33.486]  It's beautiful.
[02:42:33.566 --> 02:42:43.595]  And we're also going to include either two sport bottles or two potassium iodate or mix it, match it, take one of each.
[02:42:55.173 --> 02:42:56.876]  That's a $471 value.
[02:42:56.896 --> 02:43:01.544]  We're going to do the special at $383, which is the savings of $88.
[02:43:01.764 --> 02:43:04.950]  Well, let me just stop, because, Jim, you were coming on the show.
[02:43:04.990 --> 02:43:06.132]  I had no idea what the special would be.
[02:43:06.773 --> 02:43:07.914]  Is that the new special?
[02:43:07.954 --> 02:43:08.835]  Is that on the website?
[02:43:09.095 --> 02:43:10.136]  Yeah, that's on the website.
[02:43:30.215 --> 02:43:32.556]  Or want to be a sponsor of this show.
[02:43:32.596 --> 02:43:34.036]  Sent me one of their filters from the competitors.
[02:43:34.596 --> 02:43:37.657]  It tasted like... I don't know what was in this stuff.
[02:43:38.237 --> 02:43:39.538]  All these cheap knock-offs.
[02:43:39.658 --> 02:43:40.478]  All this trash.
[02:43:40.518 --> 02:43:41.558]  You know me.
[02:43:42.038 --> 02:43:43.599]  I'm about real stuff here, folks.
[02:43:44.359 --> 02:43:46.199]  And I'm telling you, this is a great deal.
[02:43:46.639 --> 02:43:47.660]  So how much to get?
[02:43:48.300 --> 02:43:49.420]  Solar charger.
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:51.861]  The Berkey light with all the new special filters.
[02:43:52.808 --> 02:43:57.032]  The adapter, the sports bottle, the potassium iodate, how much is that?
[02:43:57.812 --> 02:44:01.656]  That's $383, and that's a $471 value.
[02:44:02.216 --> 02:44:10.664]  Okay, now if somebody just wants to get replacement filters, the new black filters, whatever other model, other brand they've got, yours will fit the gravity filter of other brands.
[02:44:10.684 --> 02:44:11.905]  You've got the adapters for that.
[02:44:12.245 --> 02:44:13.006]  Really simple to do.
[02:44:13.026 --> 02:44:14.627]  You just pour the water in, get clean water.
[02:44:15.048 --> 02:44:17.009]  What if they just want water filters or just want...
[02:44:18.607 --> 02:44:24.490]  The elements, or just want the fluoride removal elements.
[02:44:24.770 --> 02:44:36.216]  Okay, well, we're running another special, and again, you can find this on, if you go up and click on Infowars.com, click on the big Berkey, or the Berkey light picture, it'll take you right to the specials.
[02:44:36.656 --> 02:44:47.462]  But for folks who already have a gravity filter that you purchased in years past, and you want to upgrade that to a purifier so that we get rid of all those chemicals, the heavy metals, the lead, the mercury, the nitrite,
[02:44:48.411 --> 02:44:49.672]  Pathogenic bacteria.
[02:44:51.213 --> 02:44:52.393]  We have a special now.
[02:44:53.073 --> 02:44:55.615]  It's for Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:44:56.635 --> 02:44:58.976]  That's $192 retail value.
[02:44:59.356 --> 02:45:05.419]  And when you order that, we will also include the shower filter, a $49 value, absolutely free.
[02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:07.941]  All right, folks.
[02:45:08.241 --> 02:45:10.222]  And, again, you hear a lot of pitches out there.
[02:45:11.082 --> 02:45:14.624]  All I pitch is documentary films, books to wake people up,
[02:45:15.402 --> 02:45:20.045]  And water filters and, you know, of course, some natural remedies and treatments.
[02:45:21.066 --> 02:45:23.648]  But, you know, we don't say, oh, it heals you, it makes everything perfect in your life.
[02:45:23.668 --> 02:45:26.990]  It's just good stuff, good for you with the herbal healer folks.
[02:45:27.730 --> 02:45:30.072]  But, I mean, this is such a no-brainer.
[02:45:30.452 --> 02:45:31.453]  Clean water.
[02:45:32.256 --> 02:45:32.976]  Come on.
[02:45:33.336 --> 02:45:37.838]  And yes, folks, we go out, we've gained a lot of new AM and FM affiliates.
[02:45:38.198 --> 02:45:39.359]  The show has exploded.
[02:45:39.679 --> 02:45:45.021]  The listenership every year is doubling because we can look on the Internet for how many folks tune in to listen.
[02:45:45.341 --> 02:45:46.741]  Hundreds of thousands per day.
[02:45:47.621 --> 02:45:54.444]  This show routinely number one against 3,000 radio stations and networks, including Dr. Laura, routinely defeating her.
[02:45:54.484 --> 02:45:55.264]  Just one of our streams.
[02:45:55.284 --> 02:45:56.024]  We have three streams.
[02:45:56.545 --> 02:45:57.465]  Huge listenership.
[02:45:58.161 --> 02:46:01.945]  But Global Shortwave is for international listeners.
[02:46:02.005 --> 02:46:03.906]  Of course, it doubles as national listeners.
[02:46:04.867 --> 02:46:07.550]  And I would say it's conservatively about a third of our audience.
[02:46:07.630 --> 02:46:08.831]  It's growing worldwide.
[02:46:08.911 --> 02:46:09.772]  I get letters.
[02:46:10.933 --> 02:46:12.174]  I'll start reading these on air.
[02:46:12.314 --> 02:46:15.697]  I get letters from people in New Zealand, people in South Africa.
[02:46:15.777 --> 02:46:17.939]  I get letters from Nairobi.
[02:46:17.979 --> 02:46:19.020]  I get letters from India.
[02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:20.462]  I get letters from East Timor.
[02:46:21.631 --> 02:46:25.373]  I get letters from all over because of the Global Shortwave.
[02:46:25.653 --> 02:46:33.456]  And Jim is the guy that steps up and deals with that $7,500 bill a month.
[02:46:33.576 --> 02:46:36.597]  And we have him up enough to get that bill paid, folks.
[02:46:38.438 --> 02:46:43.221]  We need everybody to, number one, get a great water filter, stop drinking poison.
[02:46:43.302 --> 02:46:45.743]  I mean, I feel so good promoting this.
[02:46:45.763 --> 02:46:50.906]  I mean, I've had 50 guests on when we don't have Jim on, you know, experts on the poison in the water.
[02:46:51.147 --> 02:46:53.188]  It's like I've had 50 guests on about the aspartame.
[02:46:54.229 --> 02:46:55.730]  Or that cell phones are bad for you.
[02:46:55.750 --> 02:46:56.950]  Don't put them up against your head.
[02:46:57.491 --> 02:46:59.392]  I mean, I really worry about people.
[02:46:59.532 --> 02:47:00.733]  I'm into saving people.
[02:47:00.853 --> 02:47:03.374]  I'm into saving my family because you reap what you sow.
[02:47:03.635 --> 02:47:05.656]  If I don't make you safe, I'm not going to be safe.
[02:47:06.784 --> 02:47:09.267]  And I'm worried about you drinking this trash water.
[02:47:09.487 --> 02:47:12.751]  You don't know how bad it tastes because you've been drinking it your whole life.
[02:47:13.132 --> 02:47:15.114]  I can't drink tap water now, folks.
[02:47:15.475 --> 02:47:16.876]  It tastes like trash.
[02:47:17.637 --> 02:47:19.139]  It tastes like turpentine.
[02:47:20.561 --> 02:47:23.624]  So whatever you do, folks, screen it out.
[02:47:24.766 --> 02:47:25.867]  Even if you've got well watered.
[02:47:26.613 --> 02:47:31.335]  If it's not a deep well, and then you've got farm animals or whatever, sometimes it gets that bad taste.
[02:47:31.775 --> 02:47:32.615]  Screen it through here.
[02:47:32.895 --> 02:47:34.696]  It'll do 30 gallons a day.
[02:47:35.176 --> 02:47:42.179]  You just pour it in there, the basin, and then gallons come out every few hours, and it's just right there for you.
[02:47:42.479 --> 02:47:43.960]  This is such a great system.
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:46.001]  Here's the toll-free number to call.
[02:47:46.381 --> 02:47:52.483]  When we do this, I get a lot of calls, and then they've only got one or two ladies answering the phone, so just leave your name and number if they don't get to you.
[02:47:52.503 --> 02:47:52.543]  1-888-
[02:47:55.197 --> 02:47:56.217]  803-4438.
[02:47:56.237 --> 02:48:00.699]  And let's say you already got a big Berkey.
[02:48:00.719 --> 02:48:02.059]  Let's say you already got a Berkey light.
[02:48:02.199 --> 02:48:03.059]  Get one for friends.
[02:48:03.399 --> 02:48:04.400]  Get one for families.
[02:48:04.420 --> 02:48:05.160]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:08.021]  Get the grandkids the sports bottles.
[02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:14.241]  Explain to them about what's in the water.
[02:48:15.382 --> 02:48:18.705]  This is so important.
[02:48:18.725 --> 02:48:22.068]  888-803-4438 And Jim has the highest standards.
[02:48:22.308 --> 02:48:25.010]  When he developed something new, he tested this for years.
[02:48:25.550 --> 02:48:27.112]  He had universities study this.
[02:48:27.952 --> 02:48:29.934]  This is an amazing system.
[02:48:29.954 --> 02:48:34.277]  1-888-803-4438 I believe in this.
[02:48:34.438 --> 02:48:35.659]  You should believe in this, Jim.
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:41.083]  Well, Alex, I think that you're doing a great job getting the word out and
[02:48:41.621 --> 02:48:45.083]  You know, folks, it's just important to become self-reliant again.
[02:48:45.103 --> 02:48:52.587]  And what we have tried to design with the Berkey products is a product that will keep you in good stead if there is an emergency.
[02:48:53.168 --> 02:48:59.371]  But we don't want this to be sitting in the closet, you know, on the hope that it will be useful during an emergency.
[02:48:59.592 --> 02:49:02.794]  We have designed this so that it is good for you every day.
[02:49:02.974 --> 02:49:04.715]  It will pull some of that stuff out.
[02:49:04.875 --> 02:49:07.516]  Alex, you mentioned that your water down there tastes like turpentine.
[02:49:07.977 --> 02:49:10.258]  You probably have MTBE in the water.
[02:49:10.982 --> 02:49:13.565]  Which is a product from reformulated gasoline.
[02:49:13.665 --> 02:49:14.907]  It's getting into deep wells.
[02:49:15.427 --> 02:49:17.350]  It's contaminated 49 of the water supplies.
[02:49:17.370 --> 02:49:18.411]  Hey, bottom line, folks.
[02:49:19.051 --> 02:49:20.533]  I mean, this thing will last for years.
[02:49:21.054 --> 02:49:22.235]  Just the filters you get with it.
[02:49:22.395 --> 02:49:23.437]  Call right now.
[02:49:23.457 --> 02:49:25.619]  888-803-4438.
[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:27.922]  Take control of your life.
[02:49:27.962 --> 02:49:30.545]  I'll be back with some final key tidbits of news and information.
[02:49:32.839 --> 02:49:37.166]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:37.366 --> 02:49:41.773]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:41.933 --> 02:49:46.300]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:49:46.420 --> 02:49:47.682]  A New World Order.
[02:49:49.484 --> 02:49:53.709]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:53.769 --> 02:50:00.698]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:50:00.818 --> 02:50:02.881]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:50:03.221 --> 02:50:06.285]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[02:50:06.445 --> 02:50:13.550]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:50:13.810 --> 02:50:19.173]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:50:19.694 --> 02:50:22.335]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:50:22.436 --> 02:50:23.216]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:50:23.236 --> 02:50:23.616]  That's 888.
[02:50:27.739 --> 02:50:27.879]  253-3139.
[02:50:27.979 --> 02:50:31.820]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:34.161]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:50:34.261 --> 02:50:34.921]  Hello, folks.
[02:50:35.041 --> 02:50:44.964]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:50:45.345 --> 02:50:49.866]  The Berkeys PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:50:49.926 --> 02:51:01.314]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:51:01.874 --> 02:51:08.679]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:51:09.099 --> 02:51:11.241]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:51:11.741 --> 02:51:16.725]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:51:17.005 --> 02:51:23.149]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:51:23.169 --> 02:51:24.290]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:51:24.330 --> 02:51:25.271]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:51:32.779 --> 02:51:41.949]  Enzyme Phytonutrient, or EPN, is a new all-in-one combination of enzymes and saccharides necessary for optimal cellular communication.
[02:51:42.590 --> 02:51:52.621]  EPN is created using a unique 14-day process resembling human digestion in which soy seeds are completely assimilated into basic nutrients and natural sweeteners.
[02:51:53.242 --> 02:51:58.970]  Enzymes are complex proteins found in digestive juices causing food to break down at an accelerated rate.
[02:51:59.511 --> 02:52:05.119]  Phytonutrients come from plants which provide important protective substances called phytochemicals.
[02:52:05.319 --> 02:52:08.304]  Saccharides are known to be important in cellular communication.
[02:52:08.884 --> 02:52:12.908]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for more information about this exciting new dietary supplement.
[02:52:12.948 --> 02:52:14.609]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:36.584]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:52:37.125 --> 02:52:40.429]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:57.535 --> 02:53:01.016]  All right, folks, final segment, and I'm sorry to all the callers that are holding.
[02:53:01.056 --> 02:53:02.296]  I just don't have time to get to you.
[02:53:02.336 --> 02:53:02.856]  I'm sorry.
[02:53:03.136 --> 02:53:05.097]  I've got a few final news stories I need to hit here.
[02:53:08.418 --> 02:53:15.519]  But seriously, you need to take control of your life, and you need to also support the broadcast by getting a big Berkey water filter, Berkey light water filter, 888-803-4438.
[02:53:16.099 --> 02:53:20.280]  This is Colorado Daily on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:53:20.901 --> 02:53:23.921]  Tiny Robots in the Trees by Charles Choey.
[02:53:24.821 --> 02:53:26.802]  United Press International Science News.
[02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:38.225]  Tiny mobile robots zipping through the wilderness on cables could monitor endangered species discreetly and analyze environmental chemistry linked to global climate.
[02:53:38.485 --> 02:53:48.569]  The robot networks strung on the steel webs could also screen urban streams for pollutants and germs and probe bridges for crux.
[02:53:49.730 --> 02:53:51.811]  The little machines could even help
[02:53:52.586 --> 02:54:06.055]  Archaeologists explore ancient sites while minimizing damage to precious artifacts, and any data they collected could be beamed wirelessly and instantaneously to public websites for researchers and students.
[02:54:06.115 --> 02:54:07.676]  Oh, yeah, like the cameras were for traffic.
[02:54:08.176 --> 02:54:18.863]  Then it goes on to talk about how a division of DARPA is funding this, of course, and it describes how this will watch for environmental polluters and troublemakers in the most rural areas.
[02:54:18.903 --> 02:54:19.464]  You'll just have...
[02:54:20.071 --> 02:54:31.737]  You know, these hundred-mile-long cables with these little robots, you know, just zipping up and down the cables in the woods, watching you with infrared and sound and audio and taking data.
[02:54:33.223 --> 02:54:43.269]  It says, through fixed sensors, can gather an incredible variety of data, such as video images and sounds, as well as water vapor, sunlight, heat, and chemistry readings.
[02:54:43.789 --> 02:54:49.933]  Scientists do need to be able to explore a three-dimensional environment, including the regions in between the trees and above the surface.
[02:54:50.273 --> 02:54:50.373]  Ah.
[02:54:51.374 --> 02:54:54.636]  And it goes on to say that ground-penetrating radar can help archaeologists.
[02:54:55.096 --> 02:54:55.537]  Ah, yes.
[02:54:56.217 --> 02:55:02.701]  It says the Federal National Science Foundation has awarded Kaiser $7.5 million to continue his NIMS work.
[02:55:03.433 --> 02:55:09.095]  The societal technology and economic impact is in this ever-complex, rapidly changing, environmentally degrading world we're in.
[02:55:09.736 --> 02:55:17.119]  Although people tend to mention the big brother aspect of the robot surveillance work, Hamilton said, I don't think any of the animals I study would care.
[02:55:17.139 --> 02:55:19.680]  The whole point of this is not to disturb animals.
[02:55:20.100 --> 02:55:26.042]  It's a lot more intrusive to catch an animal and tie a band to it than to monitor it without its knowledge.
[02:55:26.623 --> 02:55:28.523]  Monitoring the animals without our knowledge.
[02:55:28.984 --> 02:55:29.464]  Ah, yes.
[02:55:31.199 --> 02:55:33.942]  Which is what these robots allow us to do.
[02:55:34.883 --> 02:55:36.485]  Manipulating us, the animals.
[02:55:36.565 --> 02:55:37.826]  That's what they see us as.
[02:55:39.328 --> 02:55:41.390]  And then I have the Olympian article here.
[02:55:41.470 --> 02:55:42.851]  Many soldiers, same letter.
[02:55:42.892 --> 02:55:43.732]  I just can't get over this.
[02:55:43.752 --> 02:55:45.094]  I should have spent an hour on this today.
[02:55:45.134 --> 02:55:45.835]  We will tomorrow.
[02:55:46.916 --> 02:55:47.997]  Keep this on the stack right here.
[02:55:48.738 --> 02:55:51.381]  I'll talk about this in my opening rant, where all over the country...
[02:55:52.384 --> 02:55:58.134]  Newspapers are getting the same form letter and the same handwriting signed by the same individual.
[02:55:58.515 --> 02:56:02.702]  Of course, it leads back to the federal government folks.
[02:56:03.408 --> 02:56:03.928]  We're good to go.
[02:56:26.098 --> 02:56:26.738]  We're good to go.
[02:56:55.086 --> 02:57:03.031]  Tell your friends and family about the show, and pray for us, we'll pray for you, and please tell folks about InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the documentary films and books.
[02:57:03.412 --> 02:57:04.933]  We need your support, folks.
[02:57:06.154 --> 02:57:10.757]  And we'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, and back tomorrow from 11 a.m.
[02:57:10.777 --> 02:57:11.577]  until 2 p.m.
[02:57:11.978 --> 02:57:13.078]  Central Standard Time.
[02:57:13.719 --> 02:57:16.461]  Monday through Friday, right here on this network.
[02:57:17.061 --> 02:57:18.402]  I'm Alex Jones signing off.
[02:57:18.462 --> 02:57:19.683]  Have a great Monday.
[02:57:22.688 --> 02:57:30.219]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:33.083]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because...
