[00:00:03.488 --> 00:00:07.530]  You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:15.574]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:17.255]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:19.116]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:20.557]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:22.237]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.257 --> 00:00:26.559]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.421]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:31.188]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:57.853]  Well, my friends, it's another live edition of the Alex Jones Show where we talk about the global government, the criminal crime syndicate that is feeding upon us, scientifically crafting a
[00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:05.492]  Cashless society, slave grid, turning our world, our planet, into a prison planet.
[00:01:06.473 --> 00:01:09.674]  It is Thursday, the 13th of November, 2003.
[00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:13.716]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:01:14.137 --> 00:01:18.659]  We did a USS Liberty story about the ship being attacked, really, by the U.S.
[00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:21.640]  government controlling Israel to be blamed on Egypt.
[00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.262]  Did a show on that a couple days ago.
[00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:26.463]  Tomorrow, we have Admiral Starrer
[00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:35.605]  Coming on the show, he was the Judge Advocate General or the JAG officer presiding over the whitewash of the USS Liberty.
[00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:37.146]  He's now gone public about that.
[00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:38.348]  We're good to go.
[00:01:38.368 --> 00:01:38.689]  I think?
[00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:10.647]  In the meantime, we're going to launch into a ton of news today.
[00:02:10.707 --> 00:02:14.749]  In fact, no guests because I've fallen behind on covering all the news.
[00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.810]  I've even got a lot of the news I didn't get to yesterday.
[00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:31.239]  A ton of news, a big stack of really important stuff today on Big Brother, Cashless Society, tracking systems on what's happening in Iraq, what's happening with the borders, what's happening with the Second Amendment.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.622]  Also next week, I'm going to get a former abortionist on the show to...
[00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:42.884]  To read the bill, the partial birth abortion ban, to tell us if that really bans partial birth abortion.
[00:02:42.924 --> 00:02:45.289]  We'll finally have our answer with that.
[00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.251]  We're lining that up.
[00:02:47.145 --> 00:03:12.690]  But today's open phones, any topic you want to discuss, any news item, you disagree with me, you agree with me, you have a question, you have some comments, you've seen some propaganda on the television or in the newspaper, you want to sound off to millions of people listening on AM and FM stations from Northern California to Rhode Island, from Austin, Texas to Kansas City to Pensacola, Florida, our shortwave listeners, our satellite, our internet listeners,
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.823]  I love the calls because you take us in lots of different directions and we cover facets of this global system that wouldn't be covered if it wasn't for your calls and your insights.
[00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:39.277]  This is Fox News.
[00:03:39.297 --> 00:03:39.357]  And...
[00:04:09.577 --> 00:04:12.699]  I don't know what's going on here, folks, but we'll go over it.
[00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.841]  Also, CIA has a bleak analysis of Iraq.
[00:04:17.922 --> 00:04:20.183]  Vote count marred by computer woes.
[00:04:20.243 --> 00:04:25.366]  More on the electronic machines that are always accidentally malfunctioning for the government candidate.
[00:04:25.947 --> 00:04:26.167]  U.S.
[00:04:26.247 --> 00:04:27.868]  trade gap widens in September.
[00:04:27.908 --> 00:04:29.809]  Those are real financial numbers.
[00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:32.570]  Clark likes McCain migrant plan.
[00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:33.811]  Total open borders.
[00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:36.833]  So does Orrin Hatch and George W. Bush.
[00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:40.073]  Big story out of the New Hampshire Gazette.
[00:04:40.773 --> 00:04:42.994]  Bush, Nazi dealings continued until 1951.
[00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.715]  New documents have been released.
[00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:52.378]  Old Press Scotty helping set up and protect the Nazi war chest.
[00:04:53.878 --> 00:04:56.439]  Right up until, well, today, folks.
[00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:00.301]  But we've confirmed until 1951.
[00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:04.162]  And Hatch and Kennedy want a new hate crime bill.
[00:05:04.182 --> 00:05:05.343]  Looks like Bush will sign it.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.281]  Banning free speech.
[00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:08.121]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.122 --> 00:05:11.923]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:14.985]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:17.067]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:05:17.387 --> 00:05:18.748]  Rates are low right now.
[00:05:18.888 --> 00:05:20.048]  Call and compare.
[00:05:20.308 --> 00:05:30.795]  For example, a man age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1 million of coverage is only $75 a month level for the next 10 years.
[00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:32.736]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:05:32.776 --> 00:05:33.317]  We're good to go.
[00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:53.155]  800-430-6692 800-430-6692
[00:06:10.163 --> 00:06:14.505]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:14.685 --> 00:06:19.107]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:23.628]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:06:23.668 --> 00:06:25.029]  The New World Order.
[00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:26.770]  Can emerge.
[00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:31.055]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:31.095 --> 00:06:38.043]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:38.183 --> 00:06:40.166]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:50.893]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:56.516]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:06:57.036 --> 00:06:59.678]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:20.512]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:07:20.693 --> 00:07:28.262]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:28.502 --> 00:07:29.083]  We're good to go.
[00:07:44.461 --> 00:07:48.362]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:50.302]  The water level is always visible.
[00:07:50.462 --> 00:07:56.403]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:07:56.663 --> 00:08:00.604]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:08:14.642 --> 00:08:15.262]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.943 --> 00:08:16.963]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.704 --> 00:08:18.804]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:20.265]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.045 --> 00:08:21.926]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:21.946 --> 00:08:26.308]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:30.831]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.398 --> 00:08:35.360]  Welcome, welcome, welcome to another live transmission.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.462]  It is the 13th day of November 2003 on this Thursday edition.
[00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:46.925]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:47.505 --> 00:08:56.690]  Websites, freshly updated daily, thanks to the great work of my webmasters, are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.731]  We're adding a lot of new features to both the sites.
[00:08:59.594 --> 00:09:00.395]  We're good to go.
[00:09:16.827 --> 00:09:17.307]  We're good to go.
[00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:17.468]  I think?
[00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.327]  They're going to make RFID fashionable as a dating tool.
[00:09:50.868 --> 00:09:59.458]  They're promoting it to the teenagers to wear an RFID transmitter around your neck so you can, quote, meet like-minded people.
[00:09:59.838 --> 00:10:05.045]  They want to make you wear RFID bracelets or necklaces to have a job in any multi-story building.
[00:10:05.065 --> 00:10:05.926]  They're trying to pass a
[00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:07.628]  Federal law on that.
[00:10:07.668 --> 00:10:10.112]  You'll have a national ID card to have any job.
[00:10:10.452 --> 00:10:12.155]  Everything you do is going to be tracked.
[00:10:12.355 --> 00:10:20.887]  They're setting up what they call the matrix system with the states, increasing the funding for the total information awareness network under a bunch of other names.
[00:10:21.768 --> 00:10:22.489]  We're good to go.
[00:10:41.548 --> 00:11:04.026]  Listening to what you're doing and your cell phone can listen to you even when it's off and everything's being tracked and the feds are putting in state command bases to track all your cell phones and watch you and I'm driving around in the countryside and see cameras in every small town on side dirt roads and there's helicopters everywhere and drones in the skies and they're signing public plans to put foreign troops on the streets.
[00:11:04.206 --> 00:11:07.809]  They're building giant prisons everywhere, getting rid of Posse Comuntatus.
[00:11:09.767 --> 00:11:11.128]  There's no way to describe it.
[00:11:11.148 --> 00:11:29.177]  I turn the television on, every show's about how the New World Order's good, gun owners are bad, homosexuality's good, witchcraft is good, homeschoolers are evil, world government's wonderful, opening the borders is wonderful, on and on and on and on.
[00:11:29.217 --> 00:11:31.739]  I mean, we're just under unbelievable attack here.
[00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:38.062]  They're passing laws, thought crimes, speech crime laws at the state level, federal level.
[00:11:39.022 --> 00:11:40.443]  We're good to go.
[00:12:01.357 --> 00:12:05.740]  Five people that spoke out about the Jessica Lynch case being a fraud have all been killed.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.883]  Shotguns in the back of the head, sniper attacks, drowning in an inch of water, car wrecks.
[00:12:12.748 --> 00:12:14.650]  Just wall-to-wall insanity.
[00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:30.985]  Rothschilds are taking over the Russian oil systems, the British media publicly meeting with Schwarzenegger, electronic voting machines have been caught in every state they're involved, scamming and stealing votes, and nothing's happening, nothing's stopping them, more of them are going in.
[00:12:33.234 --> 00:12:33.894]  We're good to go.
[00:13:01.944 --> 00:13:04.165]  Great next speed of all of this.
[00:13:04.466 --> 00:13:06.327]  Thumb scanners are going in the grocery stores.
[00:13:06.347 --> 00:13:12.030]  They're pulling out the service checkout lanes, making you check out your own groceries and putting in thumb scanners.
[00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.832]  The banks make you sign agreements, waiving all your rights to have a bank account.
[00:13:17.352 --> 00:13:20.694]  Vicente Fox is stomping around everywhere saying, get rid of your borders.
[00:13:20.794 --> 00:13:22.475]  Governors are saying, yes, we will.
[00:13:23.556 --> 00:13:24.796]  Bush is moving to do it.
[00:13:27.998 --> 00:13:29.179]  It's incredible.
[00:13:29.259 --> 00:13:30.960]  World government is upon us.
[00:13:33.533 --> 00:13:35.834]  I mean, they lie about the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:13:35.854 --> 00:13:36.534]  They get caught.
[00:13:36.574 --> 00:13:37.634]  There's no bids allowed.
[00:13:37.694 --> 00:13:43.917]  Only Halliburton and a handful of White House-controlled companies get all the contracts.
[00:13:45.037 --> 00:13:54.360]  They're ordering our troops to bulldoze the fruit groves of the peasants in Iraq, causing resistance, and the UN is going to come in as the savior and play the part of the good cop.
[00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:58.561]  The globalists are saying, brace for massive terror attacks.
[00:13:58.581 --> 00:13:59.982]  We're going to take all your liberties.
[00:14:00.737 --> 00:14:13.343]  They're admitting the Patriot Act's being used to go after topless bars and marijuana dealers and county commissioners and zoning scams and people that bounce checks.
[00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:16.164]  It's just wall to wall.
[00:14:17.024 --> 00:14:21.927]  Police are stomping around in black combat boots and black ski masks covering up their badges.
[00:14:22.227 --> 00:14:26.669]  They're arresting people in Australia who try to protest the government peaceably.
[00:14:27.443 --> 00:14:29.163]  They're taking everybody's guns.
[00:14:29.264 --> 00:14:37.346]  Bush is getting ready to sign the assault weapons ban and the NICS strengthening act that sets up a total information awareness network through gun control funding.
[00:14:39.906 --> 00:14:41.087]  This is what we're dealing with.
[00:14:41.147 --> 00:14:42.507]  I mean, just look at these articles here.
[00:14:42.667 --> 00:14:45.028]  Police sees rental truck with TNT traces.
[00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:47.829]  Fox News, it was Israeli nationals in it.
[00:14:48.329 --> 00:14:49.369]  It says they used U.S.
[00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:53.510]  Army troops to subdue the vehicle off a military base.
[00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.971]  Right there, there's the end of Posse Comitatus.
[00:14:57.527 --> 00:14:59.068]  We could spend an hour on this story.
[00:14:59.488 --> 00:15:01.670]  CIA has bleak analysis of Iraq.
[00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:02.931]  We're going to lose, they say.
[00:15:03.331 --> 00:15:05.653]  Only the UN can save us, as we told you they do that.
[00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:09.676]  Vote count marred by computer woes.
[00:15:10.637 --> 00:15:12.438]  Lebanon, this is out of Indiana.
[00:15:12.919 --> 00:15:22.146]  Boone County officials are searching for an answer to the computer glitch that spewed out impossible numbers and interpreted an otherwise uneventful election process Tuesday.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:36.568]  I about had a heart attack, said County Clerk Lisa Garfalo, said the breakdown that came as a eager crowd watched computer-generated vote totals being projected onto a wall of the county courthouse rotunda.
[00:15:37.409 --> 00:15:39.590]  I'm assuming the glitch was in the software.
[00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:53.019]  The lengthy collaboration between the county's information technology director and advisors from the micro-vote software producer fixed the problem, but before that, computer readings of stored voting machine data showed far more votes than registered voters.
[00:15:53.843 --> 00:15:54.283]  We're good to go.
[00:16:14.392 --> 00:16:26.334]  And they've caught them in meetings with the CIA and how they're going to take our right to vote away, and they're just putting more and more of them in, racing, racing, racing, not hearing what we say, putting them in everywhere.
[00:16:26.354 --> 00:16:32.855]  I mean, there are reports everywhere these things are being used.
[00:16:32.955 --> 00:16:37.096]  All these companies, it's just a total joke.
[00:16:38.496 --> 00:16:41.817]  They find little wireless internet connection bugs hidden in them, they
[00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:44.341]  It's just incredible, folks.
[00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:46.262]  I can't believe this anymore.
[00:16:46.342 --> 00:16:47.944]  It's just so unbelievable.
[00:16:49.646 --> 00:16:49.886]  U.S.
[00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:52.188]  trade gap widens in September to record level.
[00:16:52.228 --> 00:16:53.750]  It's always a new record every month.
[00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.591]  Clark likes McCain migrant plan.
[00:16:55.611 --> 00:17:00.496]  They say the solution to illegal immigration is to legalize anyone who comes to the country through a guest worker program.
[00:17:00.536 --> 00:17:01.958]  That's their Republican solution.
[00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:05.161]  Teaming up with Bush, Clark, and McCain.
[00:17:06.047 --> 00:17:08.449]  Bush-Nazi dealings continued until 1951.
[00:17:09.269 --> 00:17:16.454]  Turns out the entire Bush, the modern multi-billion dollar war chest is Nazi money.
[00:17:16.474 --> 00:17:20.457]  Of course, their other money went back to ships they own, bringing in opium.
[00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:22.058]  That's all mainstream news admitted.
[00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:25.361]  Hatch joins Kennedy to push for hate crimes bill.
[00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:26.642]  You ought to read this bill.
[00:17:28.303 --> 00:17:34.007]  And as one Republican senator said, I've got the quote here, it actually punishes someone for what he thinks.
[00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:43.274]  And Digital Freedom Network, Internet censorship coming to a computer in the EU, and they're merging our laws with the EU.
[00:17:43.314 --> 00:18:04.331]  The EU passed an amendment to their Convention on Cybercrime that outlaws any speech or thought crime deemed as, here's the quote, as written material, any image, or any other representation of ideas or theories which advocates, promotes, or incites, keyword incites, hatred, discrimination, or violence against any individual or group of individuals.
[00:18:05.092 --> 00:18:16.522]  And it continues, based on race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin, as well as into law by the various national legislatures which comprise the EU.
[00:18:16.942 --> 00:18:21.026]  So one country passes a new law, we all go under it, even here in the U.S.
[00:18:21.806 --> 00:18:24.809]  Hate speech, again, folks, thought crime.
[00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:29.573]  And you have this bishop over in England just said, well...
[00:18:31.566 --> 00:18:36.889]  I think that we can get homosexuals to become heterosexuals, and now they have taken him into custody for questioning.
[00:18:36.929 --> 00:18:41.071]  They're arresting reporters who say that rural communities have served the same rights.
[00:18:42.611 --> 00:18:58.739]  Folks, it's 1984, and they're passing laws like this here in the U.S., and they're teaching your children that you're arrested, that you're questioned, that it's illegal to criticize anybody.
[00:18:59.424 --> 00:19:02.206]  Whether you agree with what somebody's saying or not, it's called the First Amendment.
[00:19:02.226 --> 00:19:03.007]  It's called free speech.
[00:19:04.248 --> 00:19:06.710]  Anti-war veterans pulled from parade.
[00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:16.218]  A group of 30 military veterans critical of the war in Iraq hoped to use Tuesday's Veterans Day parade to call attention to the increasingly deadly conflict, but instead found themselves fighting for something much more fundamental.
[00:19:16.938 --> 00:19:27.707]  Members of Veterans for Peace and Vietnam Veterans Against the War were yanked from a downtown Tallahassee street directly in front of the old Capitol while marching in a holiday parade they had legitimately registered in.
[00:19:28.661 --> 00:19:29.802]  No law, no nothing.
[00:19:30.222 --> 00:19:31.743]  Cops just said, you're not going to do it.
[00:19:31.883 --> 00:19:34.405]  You're not going to march with a sign saying you're against the war.
[00:19:35.066 --> 00:19:36.467]  That's your new America, folks.
[00:19:37.147 --> 00:19:45.193]  Those organizers allowed the parade to roll on, including veterans from various wars, several high school marching bands, and even a group of young women from a local Hooters restaurant.
[00:19:45.714 --> 00:19:52.459]  Anti-war veterans were ordered onto the sidewalks where they passed out leaflets and displayed a banner reading, Honor the Warrior, Not the War.
[00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:55.208]  That's your new America, folks.
[00:19:55.409 --> 00:19:56.711]  The soul of America.
[00:19:57.051 --> 00:19:58.373]  The spirit of America.
[00:19:58.593 --> 00:20:04.382]  What the veterans fought for is disappearing into full-bore Sovietization.
[00:20:06.926 --> 00:20:07.927]  We're turning into hell.
[00:20:10.037 --> 00:20:11.698]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[00:22:51.714 --> 00:22:56.538]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.

[00:23:07.594 --> 00:23:07.934]  Thank you.
[00:23:09.897 --> 00:23:22.235]  Did you know that an imbalance between sodium and potassium, elevated sugar and homocysteine levels and the inability of your blood vessels to widen are the three main reasons why Americans don't have healthy blood pressure levels?
[00:23:22.537 --> 00:23:30.622]  This is health journalist Bill Sardi, and Lifespan Nutrition has just formulated a dietary supplement to help you maintain healthy blood pressure naturally.
[00:23:30.902 --> 00:23:41.068]  It contains vitamin B6 and vitamin C to control the effects of sugar, potassium to balance sodium, quercetin from red onions to help dilate blood vessels, and folic acid to lower homocysteine.
[00:23:41.348 --> 00:23:42.609]  Learn how to stay healthy.
[00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:42.669]  866-405-4000
[00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:23.853]  All right, we're about to go to your calls, Carol, Bob, Brian, Tony, Michael, Morgan, and others.
[00:24:25.975 --> 00:24:39.104]  Infowars.com is the website, and I didn't mean to go off into that rant, but I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger has meetings with a couple dozen people like Ken Lay and Michael Milken and then comes out
[00:24:39.818 --> 00:24:45.102]  Publicly trying to keep the Enron scam going, and then he has the nerve to campaign against the corruption?
[00:24:46.944 --> 00:24:52.048]  It's like having Joseph Goebbels speaking out against Hitler or something.
[00:24:52.988 --> 00:24:54.750]  And these guys do it everywhere.
[00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:55.690]  It's like the Bushes.
[00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:01.595]  No one has greater connections to the Bin Ladens and Al-Qaeda and the Taliban than his CIA director daddy.
[00:25:02.235 --> 00:25:05.398]  But again, he's out there fighting them, even as he's flying them out
[00:25:06.132 --> 00:25:13.454]  To safety, whether it's out of the U.S., bin Laden's family, or the Taliban and al-Qaeda leadership, 8,000 of them out of Afghanistan.
[00:25:15.614 --> 00:25:32.958]  And the government sits up there and talks about how they've got to take our liberties to stop drugs, and the bigger their war on drugs gets, the more drugs we've got, the more prisons we've got, the more police we've got roving around in these federalized bands of goons, getting citizens and police killed.
[00:25:34.219 --> 00:25:35.019]  It's a joke!
[00:25:35.928 --> 00:25:51.162]  The mainstream history books admit that Yale was founded with drug money from the opium trade with the Roosevelt's and the Walker's and the Bush's and the Russell's and the Warburg's and the rest of them.
[00:25:52.163 --> 00:25:53.084]  I'm sick of it!
[00:25:54.125 --> 00:25:58.329]  I can read mainstream history books and read about these criminals!
[00:25:59.767 --> 00:26:05.633]  I was listening to some neocon talk show yesterday, and it was, oh, we're having Lord such-and-such on.
[00:26:05.693 --> 00:26:06.474]  I love him.
[00:26:06.814 --> 00:26:10.058]  He wrote a book about the leadership of Roosevelt.
[00:26:10.078 --> 00:26:12.380]  Oh, and then I heard another neocon show.
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.682]  They had the same Lord on last night.
[00:26:15.223 --> 00:26:17.425]  Oh, Lord such-and-such from England.
[00:26:18.246 --> 00:26:21.790]  Conservatives need to start to love Roosevelt.
[00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:22.831]  Yes!
[00:26:23.956 --> 00:26:26.218]  We need to learn how to love open borders.
[00:26:26.278 --> 00:26:29.720]  We need to learn how to love all this gun control.
[00:26:30.541 --> 00:26:32.322]  Carol in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:26:32.382 --> 00:26:32.902]  Go ahead.
[00:26:32.923 --> 00:26:35.484]  Hi, Alex.
[00:26:37.005 --> 00:26:42.549]  I have Fox News on, and they just removed Roy Moore from his job.
[00:26:44.911 --> 00:26:46.612]  Oh, the Republican court did.
[00:26:47.313 --> 00:26:48.594]  Well, whoever...
[00:26:49.993 --> 00:26:55.376]  Yeah, the court that had him removed is Republican-dominated.
[00:26:55.456 --> 00:26:56.617]  I just want to point that out.
[00:26:56.637 --> 00:26:58.078]  I'm not saying go vote for the Democrats.
[00:26:58.158 --> 00:27:00.419]  I'm saying we don't have a second party.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:09.385]  Well, anyway, the reason I called, you were talking about this partial birth abortion and the rules they made.
[00:27:09.805 --> 00:27:12.747]  Nothing's been said about what happens to the mother.
[00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:16.940]  Well, this baby is being just partially delivered.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.862]  How can they stop the birth from being, you know, completed?
[00:27:20.882 --> 00:27:24.144]  You know, to kill it or whatever.
[00:27:26.885 --> 00:27:29.647]  Well, we're going to have a doctor on on this subject.
[00:27:29.687 --> 00:27:32.488]  We're lining it up now, someone who's committed these acts.
[00:27:33.109 --> 00:27:38.191]  Well, what I'm talking about is the woman would have to be heavily sedated.
[00:27:38.932 --> 00:27:42.994]  Wouldn't she be for them to be able to stop the baby from being born?
[00:27:43.908 --> 00:27:44.749]  Well, they don't do that.
[00:27:44.809 --> 00:27:47.510]  They just kill it while it's still inside of her.
[00:27:48.731 --> 00:27:51.793]  Well, then I guess they'd have to do a cesarean or something.
[00:27:51.873 --> 00:27:52.793]  No, they don't do that.
[00:27:54.915 --> 00:28:03.080]  Well, it's got to be terribly hard on the mother, and I can't understand any mother that would have her baby killed when it's nine months old.
[00:28:04.207 --> 00:28:04.988]  Getting ready to be born.
[00:28:05.048 --> 00:28:08.710]  Hey, it's, you know, they're calling people begging for water and food.
[00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:13.833]  They're calling them vegetables and killing them, people that are in a lot better shape than Terry Schiavo.
[00:28:14.454 --> 00:28:15.074]  Right.
[00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:26.722]  So, you know, you just, you know, I mean, I could be pole vaulting, or I could be doing 1,000 jumping jacks and 500 push-ups, and they could point at me and say, there's the vegetable, and people will go, there's the vegetable.
[00:28:26.782 --> 00:28:28.863]  Why, it's not a baby when it's eight months old.
[00:28:29.203 --> 00:28:29.984]  Let's kill it.
[00:28:31.045 --> 00:28:32.986]  It just shows the mind control, Carol.
[00:28:34.798 --> 00:28:38.981]  Well, I can't believe we sunk as low as we have.
[00:28:39.001 --> 00:28:40.302]  We're going to sink a lot lower, too.
[00:28:40.342 --> 00:28:40.782]  Don't worry.
[00:28:41.443 --> 00:28:43.924]  Well, it does worry me.
[00:28:44.084 --> 00:28:44.425]  I know.
[00:28:44.985 --> 00:28:45.765]  Thanks for the call, Carol.
[00:28:45.785 --> 00:28:46.046]  Thanks.
[00:28:46.566 --> 00:28:47.787]  Bob in Wisconsin.
[00:28:47.807 --> 00:28:48.327]  You're on the air.
[00:28:48.347 --> 00:28:48.948]  Go ahead, Bob.
[00:28:48.968 --> 00:28:50.108]  Hey, Alex.
[00:28:50.148 --> 00:28:50.809]  How are you doing?
[00:28:50.849 --> 00:28:51.129]  Good.
[00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.070]  Great to talk to you.
[00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:54.892]  I just had a comment and a question.
[00:28:55.632 --> 00:29:03.898]  My wife, about a year or so ago, heard a couple of Russian hockey players, when they came over here and they were playing in the United States in the NHL,
[00:29:04.574 --> 00:29:13.120]  Just comment about how when they were coming here, they thought this was like the land of the free, and their comment was that we're more oppressed than those people are over there.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:22.827]  Yeah, I talk to a lot of Russians and Poles and Chinese, and they say, hey, we've seen tyranny, and this is what you've got here, but you people don't even know it.
[00:29:23.747 --> 00:29:27.710]  I mean, Americans think that people who've registered for a veterans parade...
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.141]  Can then be pulled out for no reason by the police and threatened with arrest.
[00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:34.222]  They think that's freedom.
[00:29:34.322 --> 00:29:38.004]  They think unmarked police busting down your door at 3 a.m.
[00:29:38.064 --> 00:29:38.484]  is freedom.
[00:29:38.804 --> 00:29:41.105]  They think drones looking through your walls are freedom.
[00:29:41.625 --> 00:29:44.426]  They think your children being taught how to tattle on you is freedom.
[00:29:44.666 --> 00:29:46.347]  They think open borders is freedom.
[00:29:46.767 --> 00:29:50.048]  They think being a jellyfish, a slave, is freedom.
[00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:50.388]  Stay there.
[00:29:50.408 --> 00:29:51.088]  I'll let you finish up.
[00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:51.689]  Okay.
[00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:54.930]  We'll talk to Brian, Tony, Michael, Morgan, and others.
[00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.371]  I'm Alex Jones, and I'm hopping mad.
[00:30:00.134 --> 00:30:01.016]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.517 --> 00:30:03.121]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.063 --> 00:30:06.749]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.242 --> 00:30:10.742]  Hey, everybody.
[00:30:10.782 --> 00:30:12.543]  Let me talk to you about your weight for a minute.
[00:30:12.603 --> 00:30:15.184]  How many of you have tried the fad diets?
[00:30:15.384 --> 00:30:16.524]  You've tried the pills.
[00:30:16.544 --> 00:30:17.985]  You've tried counting calories.
[00:30:18.205 --> 00:30:22.466]  You've even tried other nighttime weight loss formulas, and nothing seems to be working.
[00:30:22.746 --> 00:30:23.687]  You know what I suggest to you?
[00:30:24.127 --> 00:30:29.789]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.

[00:31:01.661 --> 00:31:01.901]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:31:01.921 --> 00:31:02.121]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:31:09.506 --> 00:31:13.429]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:31:13.649 --> 00:31:19.073]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:31:19.353 --> 00:31:29.720]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.223]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:34.343 --> 00:31:35.203]  We're good to go.
[00:32:03.276 --> 00:32:03.717]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.802]  The online pharmacy has free prescriptions on name brand medications.
[00:32:12.942 --> 00:32:16.104]  That's right, I said free prescriptions on name brand prescription medications.
[00:32:33.797 --> 00:32:34.157]  We're good to go.
[00:33:03.677 --> 00:33:04.177]  815-7094.
[00:33:05.598 --> 00:33:06.039]  Don't wait.
[00:33:06.159 --> 00:33:06.940]  Do it today.
[00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:24.893]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day and back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:24.953 --> 00:33:25.714]  We're here live.
[00:33:26.595 --> 00:33:27.956]  A rebroadcast from 1 a.m.
[00:33:27.976 --> 00:33:29.337]  to 4 a.m., by the way, Central.
[00:33:31.733 --> 00:33:38.440]  Tomorrow we have Admiral Starr coming on to talk about the USS Liberty, and then on Monday we're going to have Captain Boston.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:51.613]  These are the guys under, these are the JAG officers under the president when he ordered them to cover up what really happened with that ship as the government tried to sink it in 1967 to blame it on Egypt to start World War III.
[00:33:53.388 --> 00:33:57.191]  So this should be very interesting, and there's been some new revelations as well.
[00:33:57.211 --> 00:33:58.393]  We'll be covering that tomorrow.
[00:33:58.913 --> 00:34:02.216]  Today it's wide open phones and your calls and a lot of news.
[00:34:03.137 --> 00:34:05.199]  And I told Bob to hold over, but he hung up.
[00:34:05.219 --> 00:34:07.300]  So let's go to Brian in New York.
[00:34:07.701 --> 00:34:08.902]  Brian, you're on the air.
[00:34:08.962 --> 00:34:09.402]  Go ahead.
[00:34:09.662 --> 00:34:10.443]  Morning, Mr. Jones.
[00:34:10.463 --> 00:34:11.744]  Thank you for taking my call, sir.
[00:34:12.085 --> 00:34:14.327]  As far as the mind control, people don't believe you.
[00:34:14.367 --> 00:34:16.248]  Here's a patent number that you ought to write down.
[00:34:16.268 --> 00:34:16.288]  468-6605.
[00:34:16.308 --> 00:34:17.589]  Dr. Bernard Eastland.
[00:34:22.205 --> 00:34:23.785]  Mind control and earthquake machine.
[00:34:24.165 --> 00:34:25.146]  It's right on the Internet.
[00:34:25.186 --> 00:34:26.146]  You can see it for yourself.
[00:34:26.866 --> 00:34:30.167]  Well, I have a Senate bill where they admit all this.
[00:34:30.367 --> 00:34:33.287]  I mean, I've got BBC here where they admit they can control the weather.
[00:34:33.328 --> 00:34:36.708]  They're going to quadruple the power of the HAARP system.
[00:34:36.748 --> 00:34:39.109]  That's an official federal filing.
[00:34:39.129 --> 00:34:40.989]  This is old technology.
[00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.930]  Absolutely.
[00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:45.350]  Hey, Brian, I've got articles where they've now deployed.
[00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:46.951]  I had the CEO on two years ago.
[00:34:47.231 --> 00:34:48.811]  They've now deployed these, hundreds of them.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.861]  Coke machines that project audio into your middle ear.
[00:34:52.961 --> 00:34:54.141]  No one else can hear it.
[00:34:55.322 --> 00:34:57.182]  And it says, mmm, drink Coca-Cola.
[00:34:57.222 --> 00:34:58.643]  Mmm, it's delicious.
[00:34:58.683 --> 00:34:59.123]  Mmm.
[00:35:00.423 --> 00:35:02.424]  I mean, this stuff is old.
[00:35:02.844 --> 00:35:06.165]  I have patents from 1954 for these machines.
[00:35:06.865 --> 00:35:10.426]  Well, the thing is, I mean, if people don't want to believe it, there's a patent number right there.
[00:35:10.486 --> 00:35:11.786]  They can go right to the U.S.
[00:35:11.846 --> 00:35:12.486]  Patent Office.
[00:35:12.506 --> 00:35:13.867]  It tells you right there.
[00:35:13.887 --> 00:35:15.387]  I mean, it's playing the nose on your face.
[00:35:15.407 --> 00:35:17.948]  The thing I wanted to discuss with you, sir, is this.
[00:35:18.777 --> 00:35:21.180]  Jacob Rothschild has three advisors that work for him.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.781]  They've given the world this warning.
[00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:24.383]  The first one was George Soros.
[00:35:24.503 --> 00:35:29.308]  He stated that now there's a secular bull gold market buying frenzy starting.
[00:35:29.997 --> 00:35:31.098]  Well, it's a world without God.
[00:35:31.118 --> 00:35:38.003]  But they're telling the brotherhood 29 degrees and down to get out of the Federal Reserve notes and go into gold because they know there's going to be a collapse.
[00:35:59.235 --> 00:36:06.660]  Then we had Warren Buffett also state that starting January 1, 2004, the American people are headed for eight years of financial hell.
[00:36:06.881 --> 00:36:11.664]  Yeah, two weeks ago, he said that the dollar is gone.
[00:36:11.684 --> 00:36:14.606]  And again, they're doing this on purpose.
[00:36:14.626 --> 00:36:21.511]  They're even calling in the old notes, issuing the new ones now to artificially restrict the money supply to ensure they kill the dollar.
[00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:25.154]  Right, but the one that really got to me, sir, was John Templeton.
[00:36:25.294 --> 00:36:28.336]  He was interviewed by a reporter, Gary Wood, in the Bahamas.
[00:36:28.968 --> 00:36:34.511]  He said that the United States dollar will hit a 40% between one to four months.
[00:36:35.191 --> 00:36:37.893]  And he told his investors to get out of U.S.
[00:36:38.073 --> 00:36:41.615]  mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and especially real estate.
[00:36:41.755 --> 00:36:44.896]  And we've already taken a 30% hit in the last year.
[00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:49.339]  Yeah, but the thing is, he told them to go to a Canadian, New Zealand, and an Australian bond.
[00:36:49.579 --> 00:36:51.480]  And I heard NPR last week.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:37:03.343]  They said the dollar is going to incrementally go down, and that's a good thing, because we Americans have lived outside our means, and we're going to lower our standard to the global average.
[00:37:03.363 --> 00:37:05.984]  They were giggling on NPR about it.
[00:37:06.484 --> 00:37:13.585]  Well, the thing that gets to me, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are already a billion and a half dollars in the red.
[00:37:13.605 --> 00:37:15.366]  A billion?
[00:37:16.326 --> 00:37:18.367]  One and one half billion dollars in the red.
[00:37:18.387 --> 00:37:19.447]  That's a lot more than that.
[00:37:20.146 --> 00:37:22.027]  Well, that's what they stated on the record.
[00:37:22.167 --> 00:37:23.688]  I mean, I'm trying to get what they said.
[00:37:24.128 --> 00:37:24.948]  To me, it's about double.
[00:37:24.968 --> 00:37:26.029]  It must be about $3 billion.
[00:37:26.589 --> 00:37:28.090]  But that's what they stated on the record.
[00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:30.951]  I mean, the system is collapsing.
[00:37:30.991 --> 00:37:34.392]  I mean, this country is collapsing every way, shape, and form.
[00:37:34.473 --> 00:37:39.155]  And meanwhile, they're telling us the economy is wonderful.
[00:37:40.015 --> 00:37:42.036]  Look, we had the problems with Syria.
[00:37:42.056 --> 00:37:46.498]  11-9 on a mirror image of 9-11 with Saudi Arabia when they bombed over there.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:52.382]  The reason why they're going into Saudi Arabia is because as of next year, the Saudis are not going to take off for the reserve notes.
[00:37:53.143 --> 00:37:56.744]  And the year after that, they don't want to renew the oil with the United States.
[00:37:56.764 --> 00:37:57.884]  They want the Americans out of there.
[00:37:58.285 --> 00:38:02.166]  So they blew up these places like a protection rack and said, come back to Saudi Arabia.
[00:38:02.386 --> 00:38:03.727]  Now, three years ago...
[00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:05.342]  We're good to go.
[00:38:05.382 --> 00:38:05.642]  I think?
[00:38:28.286 --> 00:38:39.963]  It's very... Michelle of the World Bank and Wolfensohn... Michelle of the IMF and Wolfensohn of the World Bank said we will have an incremental drop in the dollar so people don't notice it.
[00:38:41.024 --> 00:38:42.547]  Well, they're getting ready January 1, 2005.
[00:38:44.778 --> 00:38:47.240]  To open up all the borders between Alaska and Chile.
[00:38:47.701 --> 00:38:48.682]  I mean, that's going to start.
[00:38:48.822 --> 00:38:51.104]  They've said it publicly, the American Union.
[00:38:51.384 --> 00:38:52.405]  That's the Amero dollars.
[00:38:52.545 --> 00:39:05.537]  I mean, even though the people can't see it the way I see it, this is like a non-Russian... Well, look, we're telling folks about the Amero dollar just like we told them about the pink 20s and all the new money, just like we told them about the face-scanning cameras, just like we told them about the Patriot Act.
[00:39:06.018 --> 00:39:10.602]  And then when the Ameros roll out, folks, they'll go, well, you told me the truth.
[00:39:12.116 --> 00:39:17.558]  Well, unfortunately, sir, most people that want to be children and want to stay children, they don't want to grow up.
[00:39:18.299 --> 00:39:19.779]  And that's why we're losing this republic.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.700]  You have to go from security to justice.
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.101]  What you're doing out here is because you're a man of justice.
[00:39:24.342 --> 00:39:25.222]  That's why you're doing it.
[00:39:25.722 --> 00:39:28.043]  If you were a man of security, you would go the other way.
[00:39:28.523 --> 00:39:30.864]  But most people don't want to think, and that's the problem.
[00:39:31.345 --> 00:39:34.026]  And I'm afraid they're going to have to be shocked into thinking, sir.
[00:39:35.208 --> 00:39:37.229]  Well, that's why they're getting rid of Posse Comitatus.
[00:39:37.269 --> 00:39:43.191]  That's why they're training even small-town police in riot activity for land confiscation.
[00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:47.353]  The Marines, local police are training to force you off your land, to kill you.
[00:39:48.374 --> 00:39:49.874]  They're really setting it up, Brian.
[00:39:50.194 --> 00:39:52.255]  Well, in conclusion, I'll end with this.
[00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:59.518]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is already passing a bill to give illegal aliens work permits, and Senator John McCain is going to sponsor the bill.
[00:39:59.758 --> 00:40:01.139]  And starting four days ago...
[00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:08.782]  I mean, it's becoming a joke, sir.
[00:40:08.902 --> 00:40:11.663]  I mean, if it wasn't so tragic, it would be laughable.
[00:40:11.783 --> 00:40:13.944]  But the thing is, the joke is going to be enough so we don't wake up.
[00:40:14.284 --> 00:40:20.266]  But Sean Hannity said Arnold was good, and so did Pat Robertson.
[00:40:20.979 --> 00:40:22.281]  That's because they get paid.
[00:40:22.341 --> 00:40:24.325]  If they got paid to say the other thing, they would say it.
[00:40:24.565 --> 00:40:26.689]  They're nothing, but I don't want to use bad language in your program.
[00:40:26.709 --> 00:40:29.093]  But, you know, these men have no scruples.
[00:40:29.654 --> 00:40:30.415]  Let's put it that way.
[00:40:30.455 --> 00:40:33.921]  They go for the highest bid or whatever the highest bid tells them what to do, they'll do.
[00:40:34.494 --> 00:40:46.801]  By the way, Mr. Oxy Cotton, who says put anybody in prison who's got marijuana, Mr. Hillbilly Heroin, Mr. 100 Pills a Day That Would Literally Kill an Elephant, he's going to be coming back to the airwaves next Monday.
[00:40:46.821 --> 00:40:48.583]  Oh, he's part of the Brotherhood.
[00:40:48.923 --> 00:40:54.086]  When he had his program on New York, he used to have the square, the circle, and the pyramid, which is the Brotherhood.
[00:40:54.306 --> 00:40:55.987]  Then he had to take it off because it got obvious.
[00:40:56.664 --> 00:40:59.266]  As long as he doesn't double-cross the brotherhood, he stays in.
[00:40:59.286 --> 00:41:08.052]  The minute he opens up his mother's brotherhood, sir, he's going to... But let your teenage daughter be found with a handful of pills, she's going to be serving hard time.
[00:41:08.352 --> 00:41:11.954]  Well, you know, sir, their example is if you're not one of us, you are as nothing.
[00:41:11.974 --> 00:41:13.235]  That's how they are.
[00:41:13.275 --> 00:41:15.637]  I mean, these people are Luciferian vampires.
[00:41:15.657 --> 00:41:17.758]  The only way I could describe it... I hear you, Brian.
[00:41:17.879 --> 00:41:18.419]  Great points.
[00:41:18.459 --> 00:41:19.079]  Thanks for the call.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.520]  Tony in Ohio.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.461]  Tony, you're on the air.
[00:41:21.501 --> 00:41:22.021]  Go ahead.
[00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:24.743]  Hello?
[00:41:25.203 --> 00:41:25.804]  Yes, Tony.
[00:41:26.297 --> 00:41:26.497]  Yes.
[00:41:26.857 --> 00:41:31.700]  I just have a thing I want to say, so I hope you don't interrupt me too much when I say it.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:36.423]  You have the Ten Commandments with Roy Moore.
[00:41:36.463 --> 00:41:40.145]  Roy Moore was suspended for having the Ten Commandments in his courtroom.
[00:41:41.046 --> 00:41:50.332]  And then in Texas, Judge Samuel B. Kent said that at the high school graduation in Galveston County, if anybody utters the word Jesus, they will be arrested by the U.S.
[00:41:50.392 --> 00:41:51.812]  Marshals and that they will be there.
[00:41:51.832 --> 00:41:53.994]  In Missouri and St.
[00:41:54.034 --> 00:41:54.314]  Louis,
[00:41:54.881 --> 00:42:02.684]  The fourth grader, Raymond Raines, prayed at lunchtime and was given a week's detention.
[00:42:03.964 --> 00:42:22.590]  And then in New York City, a lady in New York City, I forget the lady's name now, her children want to put up the nativity scene at school, and they said, no, you can't put it up, but they're allowed to put up Jewish menorahs, which is religious material.
[00:42:23.427 --> 00:42:42.833]  And then John Ashcroft, during the ADL, at an ADL meeting, told the ADL that, so many words, that anti-Semitism, terrorism, and the Patriot Act all go together because he says verbal attacks on the Jewish people are portends for the savage criminality for things to come.
[00:42:42.953 --> 00:42:44.854]  In other words, freedom of speech...
[00:42:47.922 --> 00:42:59.775]  And according to the EU statements I just read, if British farmers criticize German produce, they're arrested.
[00:43:00.296 --> 00:43:05.402]  If a bishop says homosexuality to change their lifestyle, they're arrested.
[00:43:06.062 --> 00:43:07.863]  If reporters say that, they're arrested.
[00:43:08.924 --> 00:43:11.645]  They're passed the law in Pennsylvania where you can be arrested.
[00:43:12.326 --> 00:43:16.488]  Yes, and anti-war veterans.
[00:43:16.528 --> 00:43:16.828]  Hold on.
[00:43:17.249 --> 00:43:18.169]  Hold on just a second.
[00:43:18.209 --> 00:43:18.489]  Hold on.
[00:43:18.509 --> 00:43:19.710]  In fact, I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.232]  Because I want to explain something about this show.
[00:43:23.172 --> 00:43:25.213]  I let callers talk longer than anybody else does.
[00:43:26.014 --> 00:43:26.254]  Okay?
[00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.159]  But I add points.
[00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:32.720]  So I want you to time out, folks, how long callers talk.
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:37.122]  Get a stopwatch out, time how long they talk, and then time how long they're allowed to talk on other shows.
[00:43:37.522 --> 00:43:39.063]  But then I'm going to add points.
[00:43:39.763 --> 00:43:41.124]  And everything you said was true.
[00:43:41.664 --> 00:43:41.944]  Okay?
[00:43:41.984 --> 00:43:43.785]  So I'm going to add some more points to this.
[00:43:44.305 --> 00:43:48.467]  Because we need to strengthen the argument and show people what's really happening.
[00:43:49.087 --> 00:43:49.407]  Okay?
[00:43:50.068 --> 00:43:52.249]  Now, you can go ahead and finish up, Tony.
[00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:54.069]  Hello, are you there?
[00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:55.170]  Yeah, I'm right here.
[00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:56.871]  You're absolutely right.
[00:43:57.011 --> 00:43:57.271]  I just...
[00:43:58.106 --> 00:44:00.868]  Well, no, I appreciate your call, Tony, and it's great points, and thank you.
[00:44:00.908 --> 00:44:02.329]  I just didn't want to run over you.
[00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:04.691]  I wanted to add my points there because they're important.
[00:44:04.711 --> 00:44:04.971]  Thank you.
[00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:23.730]  Look, it's simple.
[00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:25.571]  They're trying to create a chilling effect.
[00:44:25.591 --> 00:44:29.652]  They're trying to bully everyone into shutting up and going along with this agenda.
[00:44:30.692 --> 00:44:35.833]  If you're a criminal, if you're a drug addict, if you're a real live Nazi, you're going to be just fine.
[00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:37.534]  If you love freedom, they're going to come after you.
[00:44:37.874 --> 00:44:39.714]  But there's more of us than there are of them.
[00:44:40.515 --> 00:44:48.276]  And you've got these veterans in a Veterans Day parade who signed up, who were authorized to be there, as if you even need to know the First Amendment.
[00:44:48.737 --> 00:44:50.437]  They have the Hooters girls out there.
[00:44:51.843 --> 00:44:52.263]  We're good to go.
[00:44:52.303 --> 00:44:53.063]  We're good to go.
[00:45:18.152 --> 00:45:20.073]  In a republic, you have a rule of law.
[00:45:20.113 --> 00:45:22.475]  The minority is protected as well as the majority.
[00:45:22.595 --> 00:45:27.458]  In a democracy, if people shout, shut them up, it happens.
[00:45:29.279 --> 00:45:35.322]  And so the globalists can feed the mass whatever they want to tell them and then turn the mass against those who they don't agree with.
[00:45:36.063 --> 00:45:36.823]  So thank you, Tony.
[00:45:37.183 --> 00:45:40.265]  Michael in Texas, then Morgan, Mark, Barney, Helen, and others.
[00:45:40.946 --> 00:45:42.126]  Go ahead, Michael.
[00:45:45.408 --> 00:45:45.848]  Go ahead.
[00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:46.509]  You're on the air.
[00:45:49.165 --> 00:45:50.366]  Okay, he's not there.
[00:45:50.926 --> 00:45:52.448]  Morgan in Washington State.
[00:45:52.508 --> 00:45:53.388]  Morgan, you're on the air.
[00:45:53.428 --> 00:45:53.869]  Go ahead.
[00:45:53.889 --> 00:45:59.093]  I thought I would just throw a little bit more light on the police state.
[00:45:59.273 --> 00:46:02.215]  I've got an article here by the Associated Press.
[00:46:02.555 --> 00:46:06.739]  Pam Hamilton, South Carolina community split over raid.
[00:46:07.499 --> 00:46:09.601]  Little town of Goose Creek, South Carolina.
[00:46:09.641 --> 00:46:13.424]  This small community just a few miles north of Charleston is split over weather.
[00:46:13.464 --> 00:46:15.145]  Police went too far last week.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:27.089]  When they conducted a high school drug sweep with their weapons drawn, more than 100 Stafford High School students were ordered to crouch in a hallway, some restrained with plastic handcuffs, while 14 officers and a dog searched for drugs.
[00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:37.877]  No drugs were found, no arrests were made, and this school is completely under video surveillance, and those cameras are accessible by the police from the police headquarters there.
[00:46:38.456 --> 00:46:41.839]  Which is a violation of the Fifth Amendment and Fourth Amendment.
[00:46:41.859 --> 00:46:52.747]  Your children are being trained how to live in a prison grid system, and no drugs were found, and they pointed and cussed at the children and pointed guns at their heads with loaded firearms.
[00:46:53.187 --> 00:46:54.148]  Everyone is guilty.
[00:46:54.268 --> 00:46:55.249]  Everyone is a prisoner.
[00:46:55.449 --> 00:47:02.514]  Well, the fact that they wondered if they went too far is just a ridiculous assertion, and what's even worse...
[00:47:03.352 --> 00:47:09.297]  My sister-in-law is a librarian there, and she said that she thought it was a good idea.
[00:47:09.317 --> 00:47:12.560]  I just said, oh, God save you, honey.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.061]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:30.394]  Yeah, the government ships the drugs in, pushes Ritalin and Prozac on 10 million children, teaches them how to have sex, teaches them about world government, teach them how to write reports on mommy and daddy in every middle school I know of, have BATF in the classrooms now as part of a federal program.
[00:47:30.894 --> 00:47:33.995]  Train them how to load on the buses at gunpoint with their hands behind their head.
[00:47:34.555 --> 00:47:36.856]  And this is a good idea.
[00:47:36.876 --> 00:47:41.857]  Yeah, unfortunately, I guess that's pretty much where we're headed.
[00:47:41.917 --> 00:47:44.838]  And we, certain of us, know it.
[00:47:44.938 --> 00:47:49.820]  And the rest are just completely in the dark.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:51.800]  But every once in a while, there's a glimmer.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:57.522]  You know, yesterday I was sitting in the tire store having a repair made to a tire on my car.
[00:47:58.231 --> 00:48:06.174]  And I noticed this lady, she was about 80 years old, she's sitting there reading a book and it's called Being One with the Universe.
[00:48:06.814 --> 00:48:15.177]  And after a few minutes I just decided to ask her what the book was, if she was taking a course in school or if that was just something she had an interest in.
[00:48:15.917 --> 00:48:17.458]  And she was being very political, correct?
[00:48:17.518 --> 00:48:20.139]  And she was pretty succinct about telling me what the book was about and then
[00:48:20.669 --> 00:48:24.251]  Then I asked her very politely, I said, well, is this something that you go along with?
[00:48:24.291 --> 00:48:27.773]  She goes, oh, no, this is just more of that New World Order blank.
[00:48:28.153 --> 00:48:32.176]  She goes, I just wanted to know where these fruitcakes were coming from.
[00:48:32.596 --> 00:48:35.618]  And I was thinking, you know, hallelujah.
[00:48:35.638 --> 00:48:36.759]  This is wonderful.
[00:48:36.779 --> 00:48:39.420]  This lady is 80 years old, and she's got it pegged, you know?
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:40.961]  Let me tell you something.
[00:48:41.381 --> 00:48:42.442]  I have talked to the people.
[00:48:42.522 --> 00:48:47.565]  I've done over 1,000 interviews on every station you can imagine, liberal, conservative, conservative.
[00:48:48.399 --> 00:48:49.279]  Thanks for the call.
[00:49:13.737 --> 00:49:24.299]  The government admits they're going to put mind control transmitters that they admit can control your mind, that is make you pass out, make you become a giddy, make you start vomiting.
[00:49:24.319 --> 00:49:26.739]  They're going to put these up for your safety around the country.
[00:49:26.779 --> 00:49:33.901]  They're now announcing it's all part of freedom, just like the microchips they're announcing every day, every ten seconds on the news, how wonderful they are.
[00:49:34.881 --> 00:49:41.902]  And we'll be going over that and a bunch of other important news when we get back here on the show.
[00:49:43.716 --> 00:49:45.017]  And we are in desperate times.
[00:49:45.297 --> 00:49:48.458]  And things are very, very serious, what we're dealing with right now.
[00:49:49.538 --> 00:49:59.202]  But, again, they're just trying to announce their whole system, announce their takeover, and they're hoping we just sit here with our thumbs in our mouths like babies and accept it.
[00:50:00.283 --> 00:50:07.486]  And it would be like being teleported back in time to the Aztec kingdom as they were sacrificing people en masse.
[00:50:07.526 --> 00:50:08.926]  And to the Aztecs it was normal.
[00:50:09.467 --> 00:50:12.568]  But to a person of different moral compass it would be horrible.
[00:50:13.388 --> 00:50:16.711]  So they can tell us, you know, Hitler said it was normal to do what he was doing.
[00:50:17.151 --> 00:50:20.454]  And if you were in Germany, you were brainwashed incrementally into believing it.
[00:50:21.115 --> 00:50:22.956]  But we don't have to go down that path.
[00:50:23.036 --> 00:50:24.157]  We can say no!
[00:50:25.018 --> 00:50:26.159]  We have a First Amendment.
[00:50:26.179 --> 00:50:27.280]  We have a Second Amendment.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.340]  We have a Fifth Amendment.
[00:50:28.601 --> 00:50:29.702]  We have a Tenth Amendment.
[00:50:30.102 --> 00:50:32.864]  We're saying no to the federal zoning to take our property rights.
[00:50:32.884 --> 00:50:34.506]  We're saying no to your public schools.
[00:50:34.926 --> 00:50:36.607]  We're saying no to your vaccines.
[00:50:36.647 --> 00:50:38.349]  We're saying no to your war.
[00:50:39.508 --> 00:50:43.611]  They're desperate, and they're showing the world what they are right now.
[00:50:45.392 --> 00:50:47.373]  Your calls are coming up and a bunch of other news.
[00:50:48.134 --> 00:50:48.954]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:48.994 --> 00:50:58.841]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, as well as JonesReport.com, Infowars.net, and VirginUtah.com.
[00:50:59.341 --> 00:51:00.862]  Check them all out today.
[00:51:03.003 --> 00:51:03.504]  Oh, man.
[00:51:03.784 --> 00:51:04.644]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.684 --> 00:51:06.706]  You don't want to miss any of this info or these great calls.
[00:51:06.746 --> 00:51:07.146]  Stay with us.
[00:51:10.211 --> 00:51:12.012]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[00:51:12.212 --> 00:51:15.073]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[00:51:15.313 --> 00:51:17.134]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:18.835]  Rates are low right now.
[00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:20.135]  Call and compare.
[00:51:20.396 --> 00:51:30.860]  For example, a man age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1 million of coverage is only $75 a month level for the next 10 years.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.821]  Call Term Busters now.
[00:51:32.841 --> 00:51:33.361]  We're good to go.
[00:51:55.189 --> 00:52:00.655]  Remember, $1 million in term life insurance coverage for as little as $3 a day.
[00:52:00.775 --> 00:52:01.936]  Call right now.
[00:52:02.217 --> 00:52:03.938]  Operators are standing by.
[00:52:03.958 --> 00:52:03.998]  800-430-6692.
[00:52:04.018 --> 00:52:04.058]  800-430-6692.
[00:52:10.565 --> 00:52:11.205]  We're good to go.
[00:52:31.516 --> 00:52:32.797]  radioactive poisoning.
[00:52:32.877 --> 00:52:38.779]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:38.959 --> 00:52:44.041]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:53.045]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:53.305 --> 00:53:00.188]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888
[00:53:00.828 --> 00:53:02.410]  Call now and get free shipping.
[00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.770]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:53:09.815 --> 00:53:16.639]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:53:16.959 --> 00:53:18.340]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.721]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:53:20.881 --> 00:53:22.983]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:53:23.263 --> 00:53:28.185]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:53:28.526 --> 00:53:32.548]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:53:32.808 --> 00:53:33.248]  We're good to go.
[00:53:33.268 --> 00:53:33.768]  We're good to go.
[00:53:56.514 --> 00:54:03.600]  That's 888-253-3139 or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:04.580]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:54:13.453 --> 00:54:13.993]  Don't worry.
[00:54:14.433 --> 00:54:15.954]  This show is documented.
[00:54:16.474 --> 00:54:19.255]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:22.757 --> 00:54:29.660]  Folks, what the neocons do is they get up and talk about how bad the open borders are.
[00:54:31.024 --> 00:54:34.407]  Then say in the next breath, that's why we've got to support George W. Bush.
[00:54:34.687 --> 00:54:43.514]  And then don't even mention on the Laura Ingraham shows and the Rush Limbaugh shows and the Sean Hannity's of the world, don't even mention that Bush is for totally open borders.
[00:54:45.396 --> 00:54:47.578]  So they make you feel like they're doing something.
[00:54:47.918 --> 00:54:59.467]  I was on some liberal website yesterday that had an incredible flash animation about the depleted uranium, and that's up on Infowars.com, and how these are really the first three nuclear wars...
[00:55:01.908 --> 00:55:02.489]  Of history.
[00:55:02.869 --> 00:55:12.393]  What happened in the first Gulf War in 1991, what happened in 1998 in Kosovo, what happened with the thousands of tons that were used just a few months ago in Iraq.
[00:55:13.333 --> 00:55:18.475]  And the fact that the Army's top scientists came out and quit and said, look, it is killing people, it is causing deformities.
[00:55:18.735 --> 00:55:19.576]  This stuff's horrible.
[00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:22.257]  It's over 1,900 times safe levels.
[00:55:22.657 --> 00:55:25.278]  But I went to their website and they had gun control on there.
[00:55:25.856 --> 00:55:32.557]  You know, they admit there's a tyranny and a corrupt New World Order, but the answer is let's turn our guns in and then the government will be real nice to us.
[00:55:33.777 --> 00:55:37.338]  And there they were even attacking alternative conservative websites.
[00:55:39.238 --> 00:55:40.679]  Again, it's like a neocon.
[00:55:40.699 --> 00:55:41.739]  You can't wake them up.
[00:55:42.599 --> 00:55:46.680]  They think Rush Limbaugh and George Bush are, you know, disciples basically of Christ.
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:55.321]  And then you've got all these liberals over here that see the corruption of the world government but don't understand that their own party voted for all this and is the biggest supporters of it.
[00:55:56.061 --> 00:55:57.462]  You people are pathetic!
[00:55:57.762 --> 00:55:58.402]  Wake up!
[00:55:58.562 --> 00:55:59.723]  Don't be so stupid!
[00:56:01.304 --> 00:56:03.245]  If we don't get past all this, it's over.
[00:56:04.826 --> 00:56:05.406]  It's over.
[00:56:07.427 --> 00:56:17.453]  And, you know, the caller mentioned, the great caller Tony mentioned, and that was about a year ago, I've got the text of Ashcroft's speech to the ADL, and he said, we've got to restrict speech.
[00:56:18.214 --> 00:56:21.557]  We've got to go after people for their comments because that could incite violence.
[00:56:21.577 --> 00:56:23.738]  And that's what the EU is saying in their new rules.
[00:56:23.758 --> 00:56:32.265]  And that's what Governor Mark Swiker said when he signed the bill that preachers can be liable for reading from the Old Testament passages that criticize homosexuality.
[00:56:33.366 --> 00:56:34.667]  It's happening, folks.
[00:56:34.707 --> 00:56:40.432]  They're going to parades for people that signed up for them and pulling out the peace activists who were veterans.
[00:56:41.212 --> 00:56:43.494]  They're arresting people that use the N-word.
[00:56:44.235 --> 00:56:44.495]  They're...
[00:56:45.868 --> 00:56:48.470]  Again, they're going after everybody's free speech, folks.
[00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:49.871]  That's the point about free speech.
[00:56:49.891 --> 00:56:55.494]  You may not like somebody's free speech, but if they take their free speech away, they're going to take yours away.
[00:56:56.695 --> 00:57:00.697]  And frankly, folks, the First Amendment is just as important as that Second Amendment.
[00:57:01.098 --> 00:57:04.120]  But people don't know what their rights are, so they don't know they're losing them.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:09.283]  Folks, we're becoming a carbon copy of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union.
[00:57:10.704 --> 00:57:13.986]  And the same people running our government funded these monsters.
[00:57:15.071 --> 00:57:15.611]  We're good to go.
[00:57:15.631 --> 00:57:15.932]  I think?
[00:57:37.958 --> 00:57:39.641]  And it also supports this show.
[00:57:39.681 --> 00:57:43.207]  The more videos and books you buy from us, the more we can do.
[00:57:43.427 --> 00:57:44.288]  It's just that simple.
[00:57:44.389 --> 00:57:48.736]  Please get the new book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[00:57:49.935 --> 00:57:51.076]  By Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:57:51.116 --> 00:57:53.138]  Please get Matrix of Evil, my new video.
[00:57:53.198 --> 00:58:02.328]  It's so incredible with Ron Paul and Cynthia McKinney and Frank Morales and Colonel Craig Roberts and myself laying out the New World Order with solutions and how to fight them and the good news.
[00:58:02.388 --> 00:58:03.369]  It's so good.
[00:58:03.929 --> 00:58:09.235]  A police state three total enslavement, 9-11 road to tyranny, dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:58:09.595 --> 00:58:13.319]  The world isn't going to see this unless you get these videos and make copies and get them out.
[00:58:13.891 --> 00:58:15.112]  And I want to thank those that have.
[00:58:15.152 --> 00:58:17.294]  But if you haven't, get the video.
[00:58:17.514 --> 00:58:18.354]  Show them to people.
[00:58:18.775 --> 00:58:19.635]  Wake folks up.
[00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:21.697]  Go to Infowars.com to order.
[00:58:22.237 --> 00:58:23.258]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:23.719 --> 00:58:24.479]  Join us in history.
[00:58:24.539 --> 00:58:25.780]  Join us in the Infowar.
[00:58:32.005 --> 00:58:32.405]  888-253-3139.
[00:58:32.505 --> 00:58:35.087]  Or just write to me, and I'm Alex Jones, at 3001.
[00:58:35.527 --> 00:58:37.789]  That's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:38.850]  Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:40.811]  Second and third hours, only a minute away.
[00:59:00.575 --> 00:59:01.515]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:59:01.555 --> 00:59:02.936]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:59:29.159 --> 00:59:30.240]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:31.720]  You want answers?
[00:59:32.501 --> 00:59:33.401]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:33.421 --> 00:59:37.663]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:38.244 --> 00:59:42.346]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:45.728 --> 00:59:48.629]  America has a great sickness.
[00:59:49.489 --> 00:59:53.592]  It's pervaded our organs, our bloodstream, our mind.
[00:59:55.593 --> 00:59:56.173]  We are in...
[00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:58.570]  We're good to go.
[00:59:58.590 --> 00:59:58.830]  I think?
[01:00:14.545 --> 01:00:19.367]  The end of homeschooling, the end of the Second Amendment, the end of our sovereignty and our borders.
[01:00:20.167 --> 01:00:29.751]  Also, a supranational elite of private banks that own our military and our government can have total control and power and keep all the advanced technologies and life extension systems for themselves.
[01:00:30.031 --> 01:00:39.095]  This is their stated reason for wishing to, after the prison grid and the slave grid is shut up, killing 80 to 95% of us as their stated UN goal.
[01:00:40.315 --> 01:00:41.836]  I'm sorry, that's just the facts.
[01:00:43.726 --> 01:00:43.986]  Yes, Alex.
[01:00:44.006 --> 01:00:46.448]  I had watched the video by Tex Mars called the American Gulag, I believe.
[01:00:46.488 --> 01:00:46.588]  Yes.
[01:01:10.323 --> 01:01:19.653]  Um, I believe Tex Mars, I like him, but I've included that his film is more of a theory, but I know it's true.
[01:01:21.235 --> 01:01:27.522]  I had seen some other stuff, an earlier video by, I can't think of her name, Linda, she's the one that
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.682]  I guess you turned out to maybe be an agent.
[01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:46.469]  Well, look, if you just go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, we've got concentration camp sections with Newsmax, AP, Rocky Mountain News, ABC News, admitting the Roundup plans, the forced inoculation plans, the mass graves, the incinerators.
[01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:47.530]  It's all right there.
[01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:49.131]  I believe that.
[01:01:49.811 --> 01:01:50.351]  Don't believe me.
[01:01:50.371 --> 01:01:51.272]  Just go get the articles.
[01:01:51.912 --> 01:01:54.794]  Well, what about the Amtrak yard in Indianapolis?
[01:01:55.692 --> 01:02:03.154]  The turnstiles and the fences faced in and the... Well, look, they can use any facility as a holding facility.
[01:02:03.214 --> 01:02:14.358]  I mean, in my film, The Takeover, I have a local newscast where they say, this old 747 hangar has hundreds of cots and porta-potties and chains to bolt you down to the floor.
[01:02:15.278 --> 01:02:21.000]  And then we talk to the local guards who say, yeah, they came in here with prison labor to set this up as an emergency containment facility.
[01:02:22.431 --> 01:02:23.632]  For political unrest.
[01:02:23.772 --> 01:02:28.336]  So about eight miles from where I sit is an admitted concentration camp.
[01:02:29.677 --> 01:02:48.253]  Another thing, too, that really stinks about the cities, especially Houston and this economy, is I'm fixing to get laid off by the turn of January, and I don't know where they find these CEOs or where their hearts are.
[01:02:49.281 --> 01:02:55.385]  Well, they're just front men for the stockholders who are generally Rockefeller, Rothschild, Oppenheimer.
[01:02:59.388 --> 01:03:02.289]  Are you being forced to train your illegal alien replacement?
[01:03:04.491 --> 01:03:04.691]  Nope.
[01:03:05.672 --> 01:03:07.253]  I don't know who I'm going to be replaced with.
[01:03:08.053 --> 01:03:09.354]  They just said you're gone soon.
[01:03:10.014 --> 01:03:10.235]  Yep.
[01:03:10.695 --> 01:03:11.455]  That's the way it looks.
[01:03:12.076 --> 01:03:13.857]  Well, that was nice of them to tell you, wasn't it?
[01:03:14.417 --> 01:03:16.779]  These high-tech workers... It sucked my sense.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.103]  And something I've heard through the grapevine.
[01:03:21.724 --> 01:03:23.246]  Okay, well, thanks for the call.
[01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:23.966]  Appreciate that.
[01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.369]  We'll come back and talk to Mark and Barney and Helen and Wyatt.
[01:03:26.389 --> 01:03:29.952]  Then I'm going to shift back in the news, then back into calls.
[01:03:30.833 --> 01:03:32.655]  Believe me, there's a lot of it here, so stay with us.
[01:03:33.719 --> 01:03:37.381]  Again, the websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:03:37.421 --> 01:03:38.922]  The trade deficit's at record levels.
[01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:40.123]  It's record levels every month.
[01:03:40.143 --> 01:03:41.664]  The record gets bigger and bigger.
[01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:45.866]  We have over a $100 billion deficit a year with China alone.
[01:03:45.886 --> 01:03:47.007]  I think it's over $120 billion now.
[01:03:47.087 --> 01:03:48.447]  It's growing by leaps and bounds.
[01:03:49.828 --> 01:03:50.789]  What do you think about that?
[01:03:51.629 --> 01:03:58.153]  And now they've got the expansion of NAFTA and GATT and the free trade group of the Americas, the Pan-American Union, the Amero dollar.
[01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:00.611]  Oh, it's official.
[01:04:00.631 --> 01:04:02.231]  They have big meetings on C-SPAN about it.
[01:04:02.612 --> 01:04:04.433]  Joint sessions of Congress of Mexico.
[01:04:04.453 --> 01:04:07.194]  Getting ready to pay your Social Security down to Mexico.
[01:04:08.635 --> 01:04:12.898]  Orrin Hatch, though, says we've got to pass a hate crimes law that restricts speech.
[01:04:12.938 --> 01:04:14.739]  He says we've got to grow up and accept this.
[01:04:15.279 --> 01:04:17.801]  The American people want to have their speech restricted.
[01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:23.425]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:26.488]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[01:04:26.728 --> 01:04:28.569]  Call Term Busters now.

[01:04:31.812 --> 01:04:42.300]  For example, a man age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1 million of coverage is only $75 a month, level for the next 10 years.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.321]  Call Term Busters now.

[01:04:44.401 --> 01:04:44.461]  800-430-6692.
[01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:44.521]  800-430-6692.
[01:04:50.506 --> 01:04:53.227]  If you're a smoker, we have great rates for you, too.
[01:04:53.387 --> 01:04:58.029]  Call Term Busters now.
[01:04:58.049 --> 01:04:58.749]  800-430-6692.
[01:04:58.769 --> 01:05:00.950]  800-430-6692.
[01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:06.352]  We specialize in term life insurance policies of a half million dollars or more.
[01:05:06.632 --> 01:05:12.074]  Remember, one million dollars in term life insurance coverage for as little as three dollars a day.
[01:05:12.194 --> 01:05:13.354]  Call right now.
[01:05:13.654 --> 01:05:15.295]  Operators are standing by.
[01:05:16.035 --> 01:05:16.215]  800-430-6692.
[01:05:16.235 --> 01:05:18.436]  800-430-6692.
[01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:26.058]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:26.239 --> 01:05:30.660]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.181]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:05:35.221 --> 01:05:36.542]  The New World Order.
[01:05:37.062 --> 01:05:37.663]  Can emerge.
[01:05:38.364 --> 01:05:42.568]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:42.648 --> 01:05:49.576]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:49.716 --> 01:05:51.699]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:52.099 --> 01:06:02.427]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:08.052]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:06:08.592 --> 01:06:11.214]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:12.095]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:06:12.595 --> 01:06:13.636]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:21.142 --> 01:06:24.605]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:06:24.886 --> 01:06:28.389]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:06:28.469 --> 01:06:32.412]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:06:32.633 --> 01:06:38.798]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:06:39.219 --> 01:06:47.126]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:06:47.526 --> 01:06:52.868]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:06:53.028 --> 01:06:56.790]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:59.011]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:06:59.091 --> 01:07:01.252]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:07:01.492 --> 01:07:06.414]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:07:06.474 --> 01:07:12.016]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:17.858]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:07:17.918 --> 01:07:19.258]  Protect your family.
[01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:28.860]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:32.500]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:35.001]  I'm frantic.
[01:07:35.401 --> 01:07:39.521]  I have a desperate feeling in my heart, in my bosom.
[01:07:40.522 --> 01:07:42.242]  A need to warn you to
[01:07:43.303 --> 01:07:48.306]  To have you realize the true criminal, wicked nature of the globalist controllers.
[01:07:48.366 --> 01:08:11.197]  They are a synthesis of powerful, ruthless families that sadistically enjoy feeding and mutating populations, destroying your mortals, preparing you to be an absolute slave in a technocracy that rivals 1984 and A Brave New World into a running man scenario of THX 1138 and They Live.
[01:08:14.434 --> 01:08:20.218]  Thank you for joining us on this 13th of November 2003 transmission.
[01:08:20.719 --> 01:08:24.201]  Let's hurry through four or five more calls, then I'm going to jump back into news.
[01:08:25.382 --> 01:08:28.164]  And boy, there's a lot of this Big Brother news I'm going to cover first.
[01:08:28.445 --> 01:08:33.669]  Right now, let's go to Mark in Minnesota.
[01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:35.030]  Go ahead, Mark, you're on the air.
[01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:36.691]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[01:08:37.452 --> 01:08:37.892]  Pretty good.
[01:08:38.532 --> 01:08:39.273]  You're so right.
[01:08:39.493 --> 01:08:43.216]  We get so swamped and inundated with scandal after scandal and
[01:08:44.025 --> 01:08:52.412]  ...examples of corruption and one after the other and so forth that I think is very injurious to the surprise quotient.
[01:08:53.333 --> 01:08:57.537]  And after a while, we just start to divorce ourselves mentally from reality.
[01:08:57.557 --> 01:09:07.465]  So real quick here, but before I say what I was going to say, in the finest tradition of Marine Corps spirit as a former Marine, you want to motivate everybody here real quick?
[01:09:08.986 --> 01:09:09.206]  There.
[01:09:09.527 --> 01:09:09.747]  All right.
[01:09:09.827 --> 01:09:10.588]  All right.
[01:09:11.288 --> 01:09:11.588]  All right.
[01:09:11.949 --> 01:09:12.229]  Anyway...
[01:09:13.473 --> 01:09:18.997]  I tell you, very exhaustive exercise trying to deconstruct lie after lie.
[01:09:19.017 --> 01:09:28.383]  I think one of the most breathtaking ones is this idea that a rising GDP means we're having economic growth.
[01:09:29.404 --> 01:09:33.666]  And I hear a lot of people on the TV, on the news.
[01:09:34.467 --> 01:09:35.488]  In fact, you have these neocons.
[01:09:35.508 --> 01:09:40.391]  They're like, well, how are the liberal Democrats going to explain this rising GDP?
[01:09:41.818 --> 01:09:48.043]  And as a student of Mises, a disciple of the Austrian school, I think I can perhaps give people that answer.
[01:09:49.544 --> 01:10:07.156]  Say the government decides to take a bond and send it over to the Federal Open Market Committee, create all new money out of thin air, and say they wanted to spend money on, say, hiring one group of people to dig a ditch and, say, pay another group of people to fill that ditch back up.
[01:10:07.757 --> 01:10:08.217]  Guess what?
[01:10:08.878 --> 01:10:10.719]  The GDP would go up.
[01:10:12.907 --> 01:10:15.748]  The government's grown by 27% in the last two years.
[01:10:16.228 --> 01:10:19.169]  They've spent hundreds of billions of dollars on the war on liberty.
[01:10:19.209 --> 01:10:20.429]  I mean, the war on terror.
[01:10:20.969 --> 01:10:22.370]  And that's where the GDP is.
[01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:31.733]  But overall poverty, overall evaporation of the middle class, overall debt, bankruptcies, trade deficit, all those numbers are off the charts.
[01:10:32.113 --> 01:10:36.835]  And that's the reality as the dollar plunges and as they do everything they can to plunge the dollar.
[01:10:37.135 --> 01:10:40.616]  But while the vampire's sucking us dry, they've applied some Valium
[01:10:41.056 --> 01:10:43.538]  To our bloodstream to make us feel okay.
[01:10:44.058 --> 01:10:47.360]  Well, Alex, the GDP is going up, so maybe Bush is good.
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:50.042]  Bush isn't running anything.
[01:10:50.102 --> 01:10:51.002]  Bush is a puppet.
[01:10:51.303 --> 01:10:55.085]  It's pretty fascinating what inflationary tricks can do.
[01:10:55.585 --> 01:11:07.613]  What's interesting, if you were to, say, ask the orthodox economist how they would define economic growth, and first you would imagine that you would have to define...
[01:11:08.083 --> 01:11:08.784]  We're good to go.
[01:11:08.804 --> 01:11:09.184]  We're good to go.
[01:11:24.402 --> 01:11:36.790]  The real economic growth is savings, is wealth production, is factories, is businesses, is the numbers of cows and chickens and pork bellies, and a growing middle class, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:37.471]  Thanks for the call.
[01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:38.131]  Take care.
[01:11:38.491 --> 01:11:39.312]  I appreciate it.
[01:11:39.452 --> 01:11:40.292]  Yes.
[01:11:40.753 --> 01:11:42.554]  Let's talk to Barney in Maryland.
[01:11:42.594 --> 01:11:43.434]  Barney, you're on the air.
[01:11:43.474 --> 01:11:43.915]  Go ahead.
[01:11:44.595 --> 01:11:45.315]  Yeah, Alex?
[01:11:46.016 --> 01:11:46.256]  Yes.
[01:11:46.997 --> 01:11:52.280]  I just wanted to remind everybody that in Iraq, like in Korea and Vietnam...
[01:11:53.072 --> 01:12:10.417]  The U.S., as a member of state and chief supporter of the U.N., has to report all its proposed military actions to the Undersecretary of the Security Council, who, by his agreement, is always a communist and directs both sides of the war.
[01:12:11.498 --> 01:12:22.061]  And I'll also remind you that when we were fighting in Vietnam, our multimillion-dollar aircraft were scheduled to go on a certain route
[01:12:22.768 --> 01:12:30.250]  At a certain altitude, at a certain speed, at a certain time, so that damn missiles could be ready to shoot them down.
[01:12:31.451 --> 01:12:35.652]  And that way the wars go longer, that way more weapons are sold, that way the U.N.
[01:12:35.692 --> 01:12:37.493]  can always play the part of the good cop, Barney.
[01:12:37.513 --> 01:12:38.373]  That's right.
[01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:42.214]  Another thing is, on this $78 billion that they're sending to Iraq... $87 billion.
[01:12:42.234 --> 01:12:42.695]  $87 billion.
[01:12:42.715 --> 01:12:43.655]  I think that's just a way of...
[01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:53.352]  The elite to get money out of the United States.
[01:12:54.092 --> 01:12:55.793]  Well, of course, well, it's more than that.
[01:12:55.833 --> 01:13:00.175]  I mean, most of it stays here, goes to Europe for weapon sales and for contracts.
[01:13:00.235 --> 01:13:02.576]  But, again, no bids are allowed.
[01:13:02.616 --> 01:13:05.277]  It all goes to a handful of White House-controlled companies.
[01:13:05.297 --> 01:13:08.059]  This is all admitted, again, right out in plain view, folks.
[01:13:09.162 --> 01:13:16.364]  I believe it's to buy real property overseas and let somebody else be stuck with the worthless dollar which they're going to install.
[01:13:16.724 --> 01:13:17.124]  I hear you.
[01:13:17.144 --> 01:13:18.064]  Thanks for the call, Barney.
[01:13:18.464 --> 01:13:25.986]  Look, they had Al Gore come out over the weekend and say, we're marching towards 1984, the Patriot Act's bad, Bush is scamming us, $87 billion.
[01:13:26.666 --> 01:13:28.907]  But see, Al Gore was involved in all that, too.
[01:13:29.467 --> 01:13:34.588]  So neocons go, well, we know Bush is good because Al Gore is against him.
[01:13:35.128 --> 01:13:36.629]  They're all doing the same stuff.
[01:13:36.689 --> 01:13:37.269]  It's theater.
[01:13:37.309 --> 01:13:38.609]  It's good cop, bad cop.
[01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:40.335]  Quickly.
[01:13:40.355 --> 01:13:40.856]  When Jesus Christ
[01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:08.850]  I'm having trouble understanding you, ma'am.
[01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:11.871]  He said it would happen, so it will happen, so be assured of that.
[01:14:11.891 --> 01:14:14.913]  It will happen fast, the more that you and everybody are able to do.
[01:14:36.653 --> 01:14:38.794]  So have confidence that we'll overcome.
[01:14:39.574 --> 01:14:51.880]  And then also, last week I heard an INN report on TV.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:15:01.024]  There's a gentleman by the name of Patrick Dillon, a reporter who was in Iraq and he was arrested and he had many problems.
[01:15:01.144 --> 01:15:02.225]  One of the buildings had bombed out.
[01:15:02.685 --> 01:15:03.225]  He escaped.
[01:15:03.723 --> 01:15:04.263]  And he's been great.
[01:15:04.323 --> 01:15:05.404]  He's doing a documentary.
[01:15:05.484 --> 01:15:08.186]  He also wrote the book Raining Plains.
[01:15:08.466 --> 01:15:11.148]  You know, for some reason your audio to me is kind of garbled.
[01:15:12.088 --> 01:15:13.929]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:15:19.333 --> 01:15:19.633]  All right.
[01:15:19.693 --> 01:15:20.334]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:20.374 --> 01:15:21.694]  I appreciate it.
[01:15:21.834 --> 01:15:22.755]  Wyatt and Marilyn.
[01:15:22.795 --> 01:15:23.736]  Wyatt, you're on the air.
[01:15:23.776 --> 01:15:24.256]  Go ahead.
[01:15:24.276 --> 01:15:27.358]  Appreciate the call, Wyatt.
[01:15:27.378 --> 01:15:28.038]  You're on the air.
[01:15:28.158 --> 01:15:28.699]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:15:28.719 --> 01:15:29.739]  Thanks for taking my call today.
[01:15:31.434 --> 01:15:40.762]  Back when they had those bombings the other day in Saudi Arabia, there was a lot of film footage, and I noticed something, and I forgot to even mention it the other day when I called.
[01:15:41.262 --> 01:15:42.643]  They were going through a building.
[01:15:44.145 --> 01:15:51.991]  The film crew was going through a building that was like an office building, and it said, Dedicated to George H. Bush.
[01:15:52.952 --> 01:15:55.094]  George Herbert Walker Bush, 1986.
[01:15:55.414 --> 01:15:59.637]  So I'm wondering, since he was only vice president under...
[01:16:01.121 --> 01:16:09.583]  Under Reagan, the Saudi Arabians must have a wonderful connection with the Bush family, dedicated a building to him in 1986.
[01:16:09.943 --> 01:16:12.643]  It was a plaque on the wall that said it.
[01:16:13.123 --> 01:16:14.904]  And I thought that that was very, very interesting.
[01:16:16.704 --> 01:16:21.065]  No one has connections to al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the terrorists like the Bushes.
[01:16:21.225 --> 01:16:21.705]  You got it.
[01:16:23.525 --> 01:16:25.186]  I'm sure you've probably read this article.
[01:16:27.157 --> 01:16:29.499]  A little thing that came out a while back.
[01:16:29.539 --> 01:16:31.641]  It was called Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.
[01:16:32.181 --> 01:16:33.803]  Yeah, that was Alexander.
[01:16:34.203 --> 01:16:34.403]  Right.
[01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:37.065]  And I just read it.
[01:16:37.105 --> 01:16:39.768]  I found it, forgot I had it, picked it up, started reading again.
[01:16:40.188 --> 01:16:55.641]  But I also noticed now that this parallel, two movies that have been out, it kind of gives a different meaning to The Matrix, and it gives another different meaning to Beautiful Mind, because the character in Beautiful Mind was...
[01:16:56.764 --> 01:16:59.025]  I created a new economic theory.
[01:16:59.926 --> 01:17:04.308]  And that is pretty much what Solid Weapons for Quiet Wars is about.
[01:17:04.908 --> 01:17:07.310]  And it uses the matrix theory about deception.
[01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:10.992]  And it was very, very interesting.
[01:17:11.512 --> 01:17:20.837]  And what they do is, the economic engineers, they carefully select different commodities, such as beef, coffee, gasoline, and sugar.
[01:17:20.857 --> 01:17:24.999]  And then by causing a sudden change, or they called it a shock...
[01:17:25.723 --> 01:17:32.965]  In the price or the availability, it kicks everybody at the budget and buying habits out of shape.
[01:17:32.985 --> 01:17:41.428]  And then they're able to control the economy and control the economics of the American people by throwing these different shockwaves.
[01:17:41.788 --> 01:17:49.791]  And you'll notice that gasoline, each time things aren't going the administration's way, no matter what administration...
[01:17:50.185 --> 01:17:50.766]  We're good to go.
[01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:12.490]  I just thought that was very interesting.
[01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:12.790]  Sure.
[01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:13.971]  Thanks for the call, Wyatt.
[01:18:14.432 --> 01:18:33.586]  What they're really doing is, the biggest control mechanism is getting rid of being self-sufficient, getting you dependent, getting you into debt, getting you into compact cities, getting you into service jobs, getting you into government jobs, getting control of your life just like a slave on the plantation who is dependent on master.
[01:18:34.571 --> 01:18:35.932]  So, really, it's feudalism.
[01:18:35.992 --> 01:18:36.552]  It's serfdom.
[01:18:36.572 --> 01:18:42.777]  If you want to boil down what the New World Order is, it is modern serfdom, modern feudalism, modern slavery.
[01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:53.044]  And they push their whole agenda in the name of keeping you safe, or taking care of the children, or being loving, or being nice.
[01:18:53.824 --> 01:18:55.185]  And it's a complete and total fraud.
[01:18:55.205 --> 01:19:03.751]  I'm going to come back and talk to Bob and Kim, and that's it for Calls This Hour, because I do have a bunch of news I want to cover on Big Brother, the police state, the
[01:19:04.432 --> 01:19:09.458]  The police seizing a rental truck with TNT traces, and as usual, it was Israelis driving it.
[01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:10.819]  That's Fox News.
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:14.643]  The death toll up to 31 in Italian base attack.
[01:19:15.644 --> 01:19:18.347]  It's all coming up, so stay with us.
[01:19:18.447 --> 01:19:19.729]  And more news on the economy.
[01:19:21.892 --> 01:19:32.645]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:19:32.806 --> 01:19:40.395]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:19:40.635 --> 01:19:41.216]  We're good to go.
[01:19:56.594 --> 01:20:00.475]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:20:00.535 --> 01:20:02.415]  The water level is always visible.
[01:20:02.595 --> 01:20:08.536]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:20:08.776 --> 01:20:12.477]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.586]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[01:20:38.453 --> 01:20:39.114]  We're good to go.
[01:21:00.848 --> 01:21:01.368]  Late summer 2003.
[01:21:24.707 --> 01:21:26.147]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[01:21:59.085 --> 01:22:00.687]  I love the sound of real money.
[01:22:01.088 --> 01:22:06.434]  Call your representative today at Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:06.875 --> 01:22:11.461]  Learn how to protect your assets with real wealth, not potentially worthless paper.
[01:22:11.821 --> 01:22:12.642]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[01:22:12.702 --> 01:22:12.883]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:20.586 --> 01:22:23.528]  Americans, get the IRS off your back legally.
[01:22:23.688 --> 01:22:26.650]  Discover the secret the IRS is terrified you'll learn.
[01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:30.192]  You probably owe no federal income tax and never have.
[01:22:30.532 --> 01:22:37.677]  The IRS itself admits that millions and millions of Americans already have learned the truth and have dropped out of the system, and so can you.
[01:22:37.877 --> 01:22:39.538]  The federal courts and even the U.S.
[01:22:39.578 --> 01:22:47.983]  Supreme Court have verified that the reward for your labor, wages, salaries, and compensation for personal services is not and never has been taxable.
[01:22:48.243 --> 01:22:48.864]  We're good to go.
[01:23:12.824 --> 01:23:16.748]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:16.788 --> 01:23:18.910]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:18.930 --> 01:23:19.870]  Continuing with open calls...
[01:23:37.305 --> 01:23:39.445]  Open phone, seeing which way the listeners tag us.
[01:23:39.945 --> 01:23:44.026]  Let's talk to Bob in Ohio, then Kim in Colorado, and that's it for calls for this hour.
[01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:45.326]  We'll take more calls in the third hour.
[01:23:46.047 --> 01:23:46.807]  Bob, go ahead.
[01:23:47.507 --> 01:23:47.747]  Alex.
[01:23:48.247 --> 01:23:48.507]  Yes.
[01:23:49.187 --> 01:23:49.707]  How you doing?
[01:23:50.467 --> 01:23:52.168]  Well, I'm on the air doing a radio show.
[01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:53.188]  I'm doing all right.
[01:23:53.568 --> 01:23:57.849]  The New World Order's doing a lot of bad things, and we're trying to get people thinking outside the box.
[01:23:58.069 --> 01:23:58.849]  How are you doing?
[01:23:59.129 --> 01:24:04.010]  Well, I was just thinking a quote from Ben Franklin would kind of fill in here good.
[01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.550]  Either...
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.982]  If we all hang together, we're definitely going to hang separately.
[01:24:11.104 --> 01:24:19.431]  I want to let your listeners know about the Liberty Dollar, if they haven't heard about it already, through NorFed.
[01:24:20.932 --> 01:24:25.796]  You're talking about alternative currencies that are silver or gold-backed.
[01:24:26.316 --> 01:24:34.863]  Yeah, well, I mean, in light of the economic chicanery that's going on with these globalists,
[01:24:36.542 --> 01:24:42.964]  I think it would be a strong statement to each other to support these kind of initiatives.
[01:24:42.984 --> 01:24:51.427]  Well, I certainly support alternative currencies, and I think that both those groups are legitimate, but I would rather have real receipt of the gold and silver itself.
[01:24:51.887 --> 01:24:57.168]  That's better than duplicating what the globalists do and having a certificate for it.
[01:24:57.528 --> 01:25:06.251]  Well, the thing is, they not only have what you're calling a certificate, which is actually a warehouse receipt, they actually have the
[01:25:07.364 --> 01:25:07.804]  I hear you.
[01:25:07.844 --> 01:25:10.246]  What else is on your mind, Bob?
[01:25:10.266 --> 01:25:10.366]  Well...
[01:25:39.178 --> 01:25:55.412]  I just, you know, I had to concur with the Marine that called in, the NX military and myself, that I just feel that we need to start digging in and be ready.
[01:25:56.012 --> 01:25:56.412]  I hear you.
[01:25:56.452 --> 01:25:57.553]  Thanks for the call, Bob.
[01:25:57.573 --> 01:25:58.254]  I appreciate it.
[01:25:58.534 --> 01:25:59.515]  Kim in Colorado.
[01:25:59.535 --> 01:26:00.276]  Kim, you're on the air.
[01:26:00.316 --> 01:26:00.756]  Go ahead.
[01:26:01.116 --> 01:26:01.737]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:03.018 --> 01:26:04.439]  Glad to be able to talk to you again.
[01:26:06.064 --> 01:26:10.590]  We have such pathetic radio programs around the Colorado Springs area.
[01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:16.177]  I'll tell you what, I'm just glad that I have long-range equipment able to pick you up out of Denver.
[01:26:18.346 --> 01:26:20.388]  We're not on the radio in Colorado Springs?
[01:26:20.908 --> 01:26:22.189]  Well, yes, sir, you are.
[01:26:22.209 --> 01:26:39.618]  It's on a weaker station, and it's just that the local talk show programs, this is my main guest of the call, plus I've got a problem I need to talk to you about, about trying to get my videos I ordered from you, but the local talk show programs, it's just,
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:45.682]  You go garbage in, garbage out, and people just turn around, feed it back to the host.
[01:26:46.162 --> 01:26:54.524]  The host of the local talk shows, you talk about neocons, Nazis in disguise, ignorant people.
[01:26:56.704 --> 01:26:57.525]  We've got to move.
[01:26:58.025 --> 01:27:00.666]  I'll tell you what, everybody is brainwashed.
[01:27:00.686 --> 01:27:02.186]  You talk about people being in a box.
[01:27:02.856 --> 01:27:03.236]  Thank you.
[01:27:21.644 --> 01:27:22.205]  We're good to go.
[01:27:44.568 --> 01:28:07.817]  Well, I tell you what, Kim, I'm going to talk to you during the break, but right now, getting back into what you were just saying about mindlessness, I mean, what is it basically, Bill Clinton and Al Gore and Hillary are evil, everything George Bush does is good, why don't you call into these neocons and say, Bush is for open borders, he endorsed Schwarzenegger,
[01:28:08.317 --> 01:28:09.777]  Let me tell you why you can't do that, Alex.
[01:28:09.857 --> 01:28:11.518]  They screen their calls.
[01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:28.930]  We're good to go.
[01:28:44.304 --> 01:28:45.905]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:28:46.005 --> 01:28:59.210]  Just spread the word about the five affiliates that we have in Colorado, whether it's the Colorado Radio Network or American Freedom Network, and just hand out flyers and educate people because they don't know any better.
[01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:00.590]  It's garbage in, garbage out.
[01:29:01.071 --> 01:29:05.672]  They've never been given any other data, so they don't even know how to think for themselves.
[01:29:06.213 --> 01:29:08.734]  We'll be right back with a ton of news and more calls.
[01:29:08.834 --> 01:29:09.274]  Stay with us.
[01:29:11.909 --> 01:29:12.811]  We're on the march.
[01:29:13.313 --> 01:29:14.916]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:15.858 --> 01:29:18.544]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:26.592]  If you're one of the millions of Americans losing their hair, chances are you've heard of Avacor.
[01:29:26.912 --> 01:29:32.254]  You've heard that Avacor has helped thousands of people just like you successfully regrow their hair.
[01:29:32.634 --> 01:29:33.895]  So why haven't you called?
[01:29:34.155 --> 01:29:40.877]  We know there's a lot of confusing information about treatments for baldness, but you can be assured that Avacor really works.
[01:29:41.278 --> 01:29:49.201]  We're permitted to say that on the air because our clinical studies and claims of success have been independently reviewed and proven true.
[01:29:49.601 --> 01:29:50.161]  That's right.
[01:29:50.641 --> 01:29:58.064]  Avacor is a proven three-step system that helps people regrow their hair every day, even people that started losing their hair years ago.
[01:29:58.464 --> 01:30:02.786]  We also understand that choosing the correct treatment for hair loss is an important decision.
[01:30:03.266 --> 01:30:04.627]  Avacor makes it easy.
[01:30:04.947 --> 01:30:07.408]  Avacor comes with a one-year money-back guarantee.
[01:30:07.908 --> 01:30:08.549]  Think about it.
[01:30:08.849 --> 01:30:09.950]  We can help you.
[01:30:10.151 --> 01:30:10.971]  To order Avacor, call 800-533-7298.
[01:30:10.991 --> 01:30:11.172]  That's 800-533-7298.
[01:30:11.192 --> 01:30:11.312]  Avacor.
[01:30:11.332 --> 01:30:11.552]  Call 800-533-7298.
[01:30:22.739 --> 01:30:23.140]  We're good to go.
[01:30:38.801 --> 01:30:39.362]  We're good to go.
[01:30:55.441 --> 01:30:56.122]  We're good to go.
[01:31:21.056 --> 01:31:21.696]  We're good to go.
[01:31:42.788 --> 01:31:49.272]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:31:49.452 --> 01:31:54.554]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:31:54.654 --> 01:32:03.539]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:32:03.799 --> 01:32:10.683]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888
[01:32:11.603 --> 01:32:12.523]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:12.763 --> 01:32:14.764]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:14.784 --> 01:32:15.624]  Listen to these headlines.
[01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:45.072]  Because they're coming up here in just two or three minutes.
[01:32:46.693 --> 01:32:51.096]  Police seize rental truck with TNT traces.
[01:32:51.396 --> 01:32:52.317]  Israelis driving.
[01:32:52.357 --> 01:32:56.460]  They use army troops off base to go after the vehicle.
[01:32:57.721 --> 01:33:02.445]  So another little tidbit, probably an exercise, probably not even real, just to get you trained to hearing this.
[01:33:03.263 --> 01:33:06.744]  Death toll up to 31 in Italian base attack of yesterday.
[01:33:07.345 --> 01:33:10.206]  CIA has bleak analysis of Iraq.
[01:33:10.366 --> 01:33:10.606]  U.S.
[01:33:10.646 --> 01:33:12.447]  trade gap widens in September.
[01:33:12.967 --> 01:33:17.849]  Clark likes McCain migration plan, which is blanket total amnesty.
[01:33:18.169 --> 01:33:19.149]  Bush says he'll sign it.
[01:33:22.105 --> 01:33:22.545]  Part of it.
[01:33:22.565 --> 01:33:26.507]  We're also going to get him on as guest here next week out of the New Hampshire Gazette.
[01:33:26.627 --> 01:33:37.411]  The Bushes were running the Nazi money activities, about half of it, until 1951 after the war, helping the Nazis get out of the country and helping shift their money around.
[01:33:38.952 --> 01:33:44.694]  Also, Hatch joins Kennedy to push hate crimes bill that will affect your speech.
[01:33:45.578 --> 01:33:52.000]  Orrin Hatch, he wants Arnold to be president, wants to get rid of the 22nd Amendment, wants to give illegal aliens double the tuition that citizens get.
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:59.121]  I've got a bunch of Big Brother news where they're restricting free speech all over the world and in the U.S.
[01:33:59.901 --> 01:34:06.423]  More news of the birth control, RU-486 abortion pill killing women worldwide.
[01:34:07.503 --> 01:34:12.424]  And then we get into the Big Brother news.
[01:34:12.585 --> 01:34:14.205]  High tech takes...
[01:34:15.186 --> 01:34:17.528]  Boredom out of mating rituals.
[01:34:17.568 --> 01:34:19.008]  This is out of AFP.
[01:34:19.449 --> 01:34:24.932]  We're going to wear these RFID tags that tell us what mate we're compatible with.
[01:34:24.992 --> 01:34:28.994]  It's going to be the big rage with the teenagers as a dating tool.
[01:34:29.515 --> 01:34:31.476]  See how they seductively sell it to you?
[01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:34.938]  FBI reach into records is set to grow.
[01:34:35.118 --> 01:34:36.659]  No more Fourth Amendment, they're saying.
[01:34:36.679 --> 01:34:37.860]  They're going to get into all your records.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:44.604]  Walmart to begin phased-in RFID tag rollout next year in the products you're going to take out of the store with you.
[01:34:45.552 --> 01:34:46.894]  This is out of Computing Magazine.
[01:34:47.775 --> 01:34:51.659]  Here's MIT Technology Review.
[01:34:52.059 --> 01:34:58.887]  Behavior Monitoring Machines, a new breed of computer software, keeps tabs on how people and objects act.
[01:34:59.768 --> 01:35:02.269]  And NASA's already deployed this in five airports.
[01:35:03.450 --> 01:35:03.850]  U.S.
[01:35:04.090 --> 01:35:07.151]  foreign travelers to be fingerprinted.
[01:35:07.431 --> 01:35:09.552]  France and Germany discuss a union.
[01:35:10.092 --> 01:35:13.434]  Devices that read human thought now possible study finds.
[01:35:13.834 --> 01:35:14.954]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:35:15.514 --> 01:35:17.795]  The future of airport security from the BBC.
[01:35:17.835 --> 01:35:19.356]  More of this behavior software.
[01:35:19.396 --> 01:35:22.277]  It's total quackery, but they go, the computer says you're guilty.
[01:35:23.257 --> 01:35:26.859]  Post office gets pressured to pry, to spy on everything you do.
[01:35:27.964 --> 01:35:30.646]  Millions to get ID cards within three years.
[01:35:31.327 --> 01:35:31.927]  Scandal.
[01:35:32.007 --> 01:35:36.091]  Walmart, Procter & Gamble involved in secret RFID testing.
[01:35:37.890 --> 01:36:00.065]  This is just some of it, and it's coming up in rapid fire after we talk for three or four minutes to Debbie Morrow of New Millennium Concepts about the November specials and the holiday specials on water filters, solar panels, emergency lighting systems that go with these high-quality water filters, potassium iodate to protect you from nuclear attack, portable water filters, little sports bottles.
[01:36:00.485 --> 01:36:01.706]  Got a great deal on those.
[01:36:02.926 --> 01:36:03.727]  There's Prozac.
[01:36:03.747 --> 01:36:04.447]  There's Ritalin.
[01:36:04.567 --> 01:36:06.669]  There's hormones in the water, folks.
[01:36:07.392 --> 01:36:09.494]  Debbie, what are some of the specials that you're offering us today?
[01:36:35.916 --> 01:36:37.076]  We'll try to get her up in just a few minutes.
[01:36:37.096 --> 01:36:39.477]  Matt or Vince, everything cool there?
[01:37:06.583 --> 01:37:07.583]  Do we have Debbie?
[01:37:08.024 --> 01:37:08.464]  I'm here.
[01:37:08.484 --> 01:37:09.404]  Oh, great.
[01:37:09.644 --> 01:37:09.924]  Alex.
[01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:10.604]  Great.
[01:37:10.744 --> 01:37:11.865]  I'm glad I could get you on.
[01:37:11.945 --> 01:37:12.485]  Thank you.
[01:37:14.266 --> 01:37:17.207]  Debbie, tell us about the specials.
[01:37:17.747 --> 01:37:23.689]  Well, we have the November specials, which I'm real excited about because I think they're really affordable for everybody.
[01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:31.831]  You can get the Berkey light with the lights, and of course, you know, the Berkey light comes with the black purification elements.
[01:37:32.932 --> 01:37:34.152]  And then you get
[01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:41.670]  For free, a set of the PF2 fluoride reduction elements that work in conjunction with the Big Berkey.
[01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:51.812]  So for $259 plus shipping, you get a really good system that will give you all the water needs that you need for a long time.
[01:37:51.912 --> 01:37:54.532]  So I think that's really good and really affordable.
[01:37:54.953 --> 01:38:02.974]  And then for those people who don't want the lights, you can get the Berkey light without the lights for $199, and you get a free sport Berkey with it.
[01:38:03.647 --> 01:38:09.270]  So those are both really good November specials that I think are real affordable.
[01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:20.035]  For the holiday specials, we're looking at a combination of the Berkey Sport bottles along with the potassium iodate.
[01:38:20.415 --> 01:38:24.977]  And I have had a lot of customers start calling because they make great gifts.
[01:38:25.683 --> 01:38:30.204]  That you can, you know, do at church or you can do at school or work.
[01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:34.785]  You know, we're going to be having all these trade gift things coming up throughout the holidays.
[01:38:35.645 --> 01:38:43.806]  And you can get five generic labeled sport bottles which have the same exact filter as the regular Berkey Sport.
[01:38:44.667 --> 01:38:48.207]  And you can get five of them for $99.
[01:38:48.607 --> 01:38:51.408]  And you can mix and match them with potassium iodate if you want.
[01:38:52.148 --> 01:38:52.228]  Or...
[01:38:53.191 --> 01:38:57.014]  You can get 12 of the generic labeled sport bottles for $199.
[01:38:57.054 --> 01:39:04.761]  So, you know, there's some really good options there of things to get you through the holiday gift-giving time.
[01:39:04.781 --> 01:39:08.084]  Now, Debbie, for folks that don't know, this is the gift of life.
[01:39:08.144 --> 01:39:09.565]  Clean water is so important.
[01:39:10.166 --> 01:39:12.188]  The sports bottles cut out a ton of stuff.
[01:39:12.208 --> 01:39:20.355]  They don't cut out everything like the Black Berkey, you know, high-quality big units, the gravity-fed system that you guys have that's made right here in America.
[01:39:21.323 --> 01:39:23.205]  And it's cutting edge, as I was saying earlier.
[01:39:23.885 --> 01:39:27.388]  But these little sports bottles make great gifts.
[01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:34.113]  And if you tried to go out and buy five of these at a store, I usually see them for $35, $40 comparable units.
[01:39:34.974 --> 01:39:41.499]  You're talking about a major, major discount here for folks that want to get these sports bottles.
[01:39:42.039 --> 01:39:42.740]  Absolutely.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.341]  That's exactly it.
[01:39:44.381 --> 01:39:46.603]  We sell them individually for $39 apiece.
[01:39:48.345 --> 01:39:51.987]  So if you're going to get five for $99, you've got a huge savings.
[01:39:52.427 --> 01:39:58.249]  And they're refillable with municipal water for 640 refills.
[01:39:59.050 --> 01:40:03.272]  And they're a 22-ounce handheld filtered sport bottle.
[01:40:03.292 --> 01:40:16.277]  So if you imagine, if you went to the store and bought a bottle of water for a dollar every time you went out, you know how you go running around and you grab a bottle of water, it would be equivalent to $640.
[01:40:18.729 --> 01:40:21.091]  If you have a filtered sport bottle.
[01:40:21.131 --> 01:40:27.296]  And by the way, I bought, last time you had a special like this, I think it was about two years ago that you did this special sports bottle special.
[01:40:27.957 --> 01:40:30.079]  We bought five of them, and my wife...
[01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:43.763]  Has just now moved on to her second bottle, and when she goes to the gym, she fills up at the water fountain there and then gets to drink clean water instead of the basic kerosene that comes out of the Austin tap.
[01:40:43.823 --> 01:40:45.983]  So what's the number for folks that want to call you, Debbie?
[01:40:46.423 --> 01:40:48.604]  They can reach me toll-free at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:40:48.624 --> 01:40:52.065]  And in case they didn't get that, it's 1-888-803-4438.
[01:41:01.181 --> 01:41:05.384]  And folks, if you call and it's busy, or if Debbie doesn't answer, leave her name and number.
[01:41:05.404 --> 01:41:06.545]  She'll call you back today.
[01:41:06.565 --> 01:41:08.767]  She gets a lot of calls.
[01:41:08.787 --> 01:41:11.829]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:41:12.850 --> 01:41:13.550]  It's real simple.
[01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:19.434]  I feel good about promoting water filters, high-quality systems, and they're great sponsors of this show.
[01:41:19.895 --> 01:41:28.261]  New Millennium is the sole sponsor for our global outreach on the shortwave to the international audience, having a huge effect six hours a day on two different transmitters,
[01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:34.586]  So they're great products, and you support the international outreach, and you stop drinking the poison.
[01:41:34.606 --> 01:41:35.346]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:41:35.366 --> 01:41:38.468]  Thanks for coming on, Debbie.
[01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:39.429]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:41:39.569 --> 01:41:39.970]  Bye-bye.
[01:41:40.190 --> 01:41:41.070]  I really appreciate it.
[01:41:41.691 --> 01:41:43.072]  All right, folks.
[01:41:43.472 --> 01:41:50.698]  Now, looking at all this news, I want to go into Big Brother stuff first, because I've already mentioned the trade gap and the bombing in Italy.
[01:41:52.199 --> 01:41:55.001]  Later I'll get into Prescott Bush and the Nazis.
[01:41:55.141 --> 01:41:57.083]  New developments in the mainstream news on that.
[01:41:57.643 --> 01:42:00.825]  Stuff I didn't even know about, that they were working for the Nazis after the war.
[01:42:00.845 --> 01:42:03.867]  I mean, you talk about the rat line, folks.
[01:42:04.528 --> 01:42:07.310]  And Clark and McCain on their immigration deal.
[01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:10.432]  Hatch has a thought crime bill with Kennedy.
[01:42:10.832 --> 01:42:14.655]  The same Kennedy George Herbert Walker Bush just gave an award to last weekend.
[01:42:15.805 --> 01:42:20.887]  And I got a bunch of censorship and thought crime law stuff from around the U.S.
[01:42:20.927 --> 01:42:21.528]  and the world.
[01:42:21.608 --> 01:42:26.230]  But, again, let me go into the Big Brother news first.
[01:42:26.250 --> 01:42:32.512]  And I'm trying to get my two stacks here together because I have two separate stacks of this.
[01:42:33.373 --> 01:42:37.635]  And there's no real way to describe just how serious all of this is.
[01:42:38.775 --> 01:42:40.016]  This is out of AFP.
[01:42:40.116 --> 01:42:44.137]  High tech takes boredom out of mating rituals.
[01:42:44.858 --> 01:42:45.398]  Networking.
[01:42:46.932 --> 01:42:59.921]  AFP, looking for a soulmate or a business partner but fed up with going to parties and conventions where you waste your time talking to strangers who induce no excitement, only yawns.
[01:43:01.682 --> 01:43:08.407]  Now see how they've trained us how to use a calculator, how to watch TV, how to use the computer, never to go talk to your neighbors, never to interact with people.
[01:43:08.447 --> 01:43:13.511]  You don't see the children out on the streets anymore on their bicycles and tricycles or jumping on trampolines.
[01:43:13.851 --> 01:43:15.212]  It's all hooked into things.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:38.717]  And it goes, the answer, intelligent tags, these are wearable computers which compare your personal data with those of others around you, and of course are fed on by the government and private companies, tell you who would make an interesting match, advise you where that individual is located, and whether he or she is available for a chat or wants to swap contact details.
[01:43:38.838 --> 01:43:40.079]  Oh, this would be great for stalkers.
[01:43:40.859 --> 01:43:44.322]  Prototypes of the first tag were tested at the Technology Convention in New England.
[01:43:45.114 --> 01:43:53.683]  Last month, in which participants wore a small device about the size of an electronic personal assistant around their neck, new scientists' reports in next Saturday's issue.
[01:43:54.203 --> 01:44:06.456]  The so-called end tags communicated to each other by infrared link, comparing employment history, professional interest, and personal hobbies, and alerted there were whenever a good match was close by.
[01:44:06.476 --> 01:44:08.338]  A match the computer says is a good match.
[01:44:09.477 --> 01:44:09.837]  We're good to go.
[01:44:31.295 --> 01:44:41.340]  During the event, although they also complained about the weight of the tag and the constant interruptions it made, and there was also concern about data privacy, new scientist says.
[01:44:43.021 --> 01:44:55.827]  Well, Homeland Security said about two months ago they want to make a federal law where you have to wear an RFID bracelet or tag that's very small, kind of like a hospital tag, and they're making the Iraqis who have jobs with the U.S.
[01:44:55.867 --> 01:44:57.267]  government wear these in Iraq.
[01:44:57.307 --> 01:44:58.628]  To have a job, you have to wear one.
[01:44:59.275 --> 01:44:59.755]  We're good to go.
[01:44:59.795 --> 01:45:00.676]  We're good to go.
[01:45:29.512 --> 01:45:30.213]  Here's another one.
[01:45:30.313 --> 01:45:32.815]  FBI reach into records is set to grow.
[01:45:33.675 --> 01:45:35.817]  This is out of the New York Times.
[01:45:35.857 --> 01:45:47.965]  A little noticed measure approved by both the House and Senate will significantly expand the FBI's power to demand financial records without a judge's approval from car dealers, travel agents, pawnbrokers, and many other businesses.
[01:45:48.085 --> 01:45:48.826]  Everybody, folks.
[01:45:49.206 --> 01:45:50.287]  Officials said on Tuesday.
[01:45:50.931 --> 01:45:53.932]  That's already in Section 213 and 215 of the Patriot Act.
[01:45:54.352 --> 01:45:55.992]  But again, they're passing other measures.
[01:45:56.432 --> 01:46:05.054]  Traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions are frequently subject to administrative subpoenas from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to produce financial records in terrorism and espionage investigations.
[01:46:05.454 --> 01:46:11.815]  Such subpoenas, which are known as national security letters, do not require the Bureau to speak to a judge's approval before issuing them.
[01:46:12.275 --> 01:46:13.195]  The end of warrants.
[01:46:14.255 --> 01:46:16.676]  And these banks are already hooked directly into the government.
[01:46:16.696 --> 01:46:17.536]  They don't even ask the bank.
[01:46:17.556 --> 01:46:18.356]  They just go in and get it.
[01:46:20.183 --> 01:46:25.624]  And they catch a lot of IRS and FBI people ripping bank accounts off, but it's never really prosecuted.
[01:46:25.644 --> 01:46:26.664]  It's just what they do.
[01:46:27.645 --> 01:46:32.506]  Walmart to begin phased RFID tag rollout next year from Computing Magazine.
[01:46:32.606 --> 01:46:32.886]  U.S.
[01:46:32.946 --> 01:46:42.228]  retail giant Walmart, that'll set the precedent, is pressing ahead with plans to implement radio frequency identification technology across its stores and distribution networks.
[01:46:43.448 --> 01:46:47.329]  And they met with 120 top suppliers and said, if you want to supply to us, you've got to do it.
[01:46:48.519 --> 01:46:54.243]  Then I've got the other article here exposing what Walmart really did.
[01:46:55.324 --> 01:47:02.650]  This is from Catherine Albrecht at StopRFID, StopRFID.com, upon InfoWars.com.
[01:47:02.730 --> 01:47:03.210]  Scandal!
[01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:06.132]  Walmart, Procter & Gamble involved in secret RFID testing.
[01:47:06.553 --> 01:47:09.535]  American consumers uses guinea pigs for controversial technology.
[01:47:11.918 --> 01:47:13.399]  And hundreds of products.
[01:47:13.459 --> 01:47:18.464]  Walmart and Procter & Gamble conducted a secret RFID trial involving Oklahoma consumers earlier this year.
[01:47:18.944 --> 01:47:34.337]  The Chicago Sun-Times revealed on Sunday consumers who purchased Procter & Gamble Lipfinity brand lipstick at the Broken Arrow Walmart store between late March and mid-July unknowingly left the store with live RFID tracking devices embedded in the packaging.
[01:47:34.377 --> 01:47:38.380]  Walmart had previously denied any consumer-level RFID testing in the United States.
[01:47:38.721 --> 01:47:38.921]  But...
[01:47:39.341 --> 01:47:50.306]  We have the corporate minutes from earlier this year with Governor Ridge and Walmart and others where they said, quote, 78% of the people that are against this, it is for a cashless system, but they're apathetic.
[01:47:50.346 --> 01:47:51.966]  We've got to just go ahead and implement it.
[01:47:52.226 --> 01:47:55.628]  And it was Walmart that finally got the barcode in 1984 accepted.
[01:47:57.028 --> 01:47:59.729]  No pun intended with the 84 number.
[01:47:59.789 --> 01:48:00.750]  That's really when it happened.
[01:48:02.250 --> 01:48:02.791]  Here's another one.
[01:48:02.811 --> 01:48:04.952]  Devices that read human thought now possible.
[01:48:04.972 --> 01:48:08.253]  And then I have BBC and other articles where they say they're already deployed.
[01:48:08.985 --> 01:48:14.532]  See, they'll have some articles announcing, oh, this is coming, and then they'll have an article right next to it, oh, it's already here, the next day.
[01:48:15.353 --> 01:48:24.806]  Less than a month after a widely heralded experiment showed how thought-reading implants can work in monkeys, scientists presented new findings Sunday suggesting such machines could work in people, too.
[01:48:25.991 --> 01:48:28.954]  And it goes into all of that, but then here's the BBC.
[01:48:29.394 --> 01:48:31.095]  The future of airport security.
[01:48:31.696 --> 01:48:37.321]  It knows your face, your body temperature, your behavior, and can strip you bare without removing your clothes.
[01:48:37.561 --> 01:48:39.102]  Yeah, you're totally naked, folks.
[01:48:39.162 --> 01:48:39.823]  Color images.
[01:48:40.784 --> 01:48:44.306]  And the next generation of surveillance technology is coming to an airport near you.
[01:48:44.487 --> 01:48:47.129]  Millions of pounds of additional investment have been...
[01:48:48.241 --> 01:48:51.042]  Plowed into airport security since September 11th.
[01:48:51.522 --> 01:48:58.765]  In the UK, an extra 30 million pounds a year, or $50 million, is being spent on improving surveillance at major airports.
[01:48:59.565 --> 01:49:07.667]  And it goes on to say that they put the thought readers, the naked scanners, the MRIs in.
[01:49:07.747 --> 01:49:08.288]  Five U.S.
[01:49:08.328 --> 01:49:10.008]  airports have had this now for two years.
[01:49:10.888 --> 01:49:12.189]  And then I have another one here.
[01:49:13.112 --> 01:49:14.953]  This is out of MIT Technology.
[01:49:15.334 --> 01:49:20.938]  Behavior monitoring machines, a new breed of computer software, keeps tabs on how people and objects act.
[01:49:21.459 --> 01:49:22.900]  He sees when you've been sleeping.
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:24.061]  He knows when you're awake.
[01:49:24.521 --> 01:49:28.664]  Ever wonder how Santa has time to keep tabs on the world without building toys?
[01:49:29.325 --> 01:49:30.906]  Maybe he's been using bio...
[01:49:32.384 --> 01:49:42.994]  Behavior metric software applications designed to understand the behavior of people and things and react appropriately in order to provide security, facilitate health care, and enhance productivity.
[01:49:44.515 --> 01:49:47.218]  In a limited sense, computers have always had to understand...
[01:49:48.348 --> 01:49:49.849]  Highly selective behavior.
[01:49:50.370 --> 01:49:52.292]  And it goes on to say it's no big deal.
[01:49:52.912 --> 01:49:59.658]  Yeah, these brain scanners will pick up your brain waves and your heartbeat and you're aroused.
[01:49:59.758 --> 01:50:02.080]  It's just so good.
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:09.687]  And the post office will go ahead and start tracking all your mail and maybe reading it too and spying on you.
[01:50:09.727 --> 01:50:10.387]  That's okay.
[01:50:11.268 --> 01:50:14.211]  And everybody's going to get their national ID card and, well...
[01:50:15.251 --> 01:50:19.234]  It's all coming up when we get back, then we'll get into the open borders and the economy and a lot more.
[01:50:22.796 --> 01:50:28.760]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:31.222]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:50:31.422 --> 01:50:36.305]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver, 500 parts per million...
[01:50:36.778 --> 01:50:37.359]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.652 --> 01:50:54.052]  We're good to go.
[01:50:54.072 --> 01:50:54.632]  We're good to go.
[01:51:20.382 --> 01:51:22.363]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:51:22.463 --> 01:51:23.123]  Hello, folks.
[01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:33.167]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:33.547 --> 01:51:38.069]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:38.129 --> 01:51:49.453]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste, and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:49.833 --> 01:51:50.534]  We're good to go.
[01:52:20.474 --> 01:52:24.818]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:52:24.978 --> 01:52:29.402]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:29.562 --> 01:52:33.946]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:52:34.046 --> 01:52:35.308]  A New World Order.
[01:52:36.110 --> 01:52:37.312]  We're good to go.
[01:52:54.071 --> 01:53:01.174]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:53:01.454 --> 01:53:06.816]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:53:07.336 --> 01:53:09.977]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:53:10.077 --> 01:53:11.258]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:11.278 --> 01:53:11.718]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:53:11.738 --> 01:53:13.539]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:53:24.565 --> 01:53:30.608]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:31.209 --> 01:53:34.230]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:37.812 --> 01:53:45.117]  See, the Congress voted to get rid of some subsections of the Patriot Act, and then they just turned around and passed the subsections by themselves back into law.
[01:53:47.698 --> 01:53:49.459]  And, folks, I'm not joking.
[01:53:50.274 --> 01:53:52.537]  I have links to the Army's website.
[01:53:52.577 --> 01:54:01.507]  I have links to the Sydney Morning Herald where the federal government says that the Army's main job will be implanting us all with microchips in our brains by 2025.
[01:54:01.547 --> 01:54:03.590]  That's going to be their main mission.
[01:54:04.931 --> 01:54:07.134]  And they say this is going to stop all the terrorism.
[01:54:07.174 --> 01:54:07.635]  And you know what?
[01:54:07.735 --> 01:54:10.338]  I don't care how crazy that sounds, what I just said.
[01:54:11.394 --> 01:54:28.129]  I've got AP and Television Weekly articles here where they admit that your digital cable television is listening to you and reporting back to Homeland Security the psychological makeup of what you watch, but also audibly listening to you.
[01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:33.013]  And they come out and say, your cell phone's listening to you.
[01:54:33.033 --> 01:54:34.674]  Homeland Security is.
[01:54:35.755 --> 01:54:36.996]  And OnStar is.
[01:54:37.336 --> 01:54:37.457]  And...
[01:54:39.733 --> 01:54:46.158]  Five airports have brain readers in them, and England's going to put them, BBC says, in all their airports.
[01:54:46.859 --> 01:55:00.910]  The UN ordered us two years ago to unify our passport and IDs with a special number and a face scan and a thumb scan, and I see the grocery stores putting them in, and there's cameras on rural roads.
[01:55:02.511 --> 01:55:03.652]  It's indescribable.
[01:55:03.752 --> 01:55:05.053]  I mean, I have stacks of this.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:17.850]  Behavior monitoring machines, the future of airport security, reading your mind, devices that read human thought, San Francisco Chronicle, Walmart sneaking around putting tracking chips and things.
[01:55:21.033 --> 01:55:21.693]  It's everywhere.
[01:55:21.713 --> 01:55:26.117]  To have a job in a building, you'll have to wear an RFID bracelet that tracks you around.
[01:55:27.123 --> 01:55:29.785]  FBI reach into records is set to grow.
[01:55:30.325 --> 01:55:32.186]  Post office gets pressure to pry.
[01:55:32.206 --> 01:55:33.186]  This is wired news.
[01:55:33.807 --> 01:55:45.393]  Under political pressure to increase profitability and security, the United States Postal Service is introducing new technology that can trace the progress of mail from sender to recipient and record the identity of both parties.
[01:55:45.653 --> 01:55:55.559]  Bulk mailers, such as mail order services, credit card companies, and online DVD rental services already use the intelligent mail offering to confirm the check reality.
[01:55:56.274 --> 01:55:56.775]  And again, it's RFID.
[01:55:56.795 --> 01:55:57.395]  Here's another one.
[01:55:57.415 --> 01:55:57.916]  Millions to get.
[01:56:09.054 --> 01:56:10.874]  ID cards within three years.
[01:56:10.934 --> 01:56:17.336]  London Times, the Home Secretary, has taken the first step to what he hopes will be chips for everyone.
[01:56:17.536 --> 01:56:18.296]  That's the headline.
[01:56:18.336 --> 01:56:24.857]  Millions of people will be issued with identity cards within three years under Dave Blunkett's plans for a national scheme announced yesterday.
[01:56:25.377 --> 01:56:32.359]  The first completed to have the card from 2006 will be the country's 4.6 million foreign citizens.
[01:56:33.436 --> 01:56:34.997]  It always starts with the foreigners.
[01:56:35.177 --> 01:56:37.919]  Oh, it's just for them, and then it's for everybody else.
[01:56:38.319 --> 01:56:42.802]  You already have a national ID card, a global ID card, and your driver's license.
[01:56:44.383 --> 01:56:56.250]  I'm going to come back, get into some open borders, some hate crimes, some thought crime news, just total Orwellian nightmare, and we'll go to Robert and Paula and Ron and Eric and others.
[01:56:58.081 --> 01:57:16.241]  In the third hour, as I try to jam-pack all this in, the last minute of this hour, you believe in this show, want a powerful tool to wake people up, want to have a riveting video to watch, need to get my new film, Matrix of Evil, or Police State, Three Total Enslavement, or 9-11, Road to Tyranny, or the book, Order Out of Chaos.
[01:57:16.989 --> 01:57:20.454]  My book, Descent into Tyranny, you need to have these items, folks.
[01:57:20.474 --> 01:57:21.736]  You need to get them out to people.
[01:57:21.776 --> 01:57:26.222]  You need to wake folks up to the bizarre horror we're living in right now.
[01:57:26.903 --> 01:57:33.372]  Go to InfoWars.com or go to PrisonPlanet.com to order the videos or the books or the T-shirts or the bumper stickers.
[01:57:33.972 --> 01:57:34.553]  We're good to go.
[01:57:55.471 --> 01:58:03.736]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:58:05.597 --> 01:58:08.839]  We'll continue to track the criminal activities of the globalist on the other side.
[01:58:13.402 --> 01:58:18.044]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:58:18.244 --> 01:58:22.307]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:58:22.327 --> 01:58:22.907]  We walked.
[01:58:26.218 --> 01:58:29.079]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:33.541 --> 01:58:37.322]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:55.336 --> 01:59:01.817]  Most Americans have heard about the Bush family being involved with the Nazis.
[01:59:03.658 --> 01:59:09.219]  But did you know that they were involved in moving and protecting the fortunes of Nazis?
[01:59:12.299 --> 01:59:16.620]  Well, that's now come out in mainstream news, something I didn't even know.
[01:59:17.441 --> 01:59:19.461]  I knew that they were connected to the Fool Society.
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:22.621]  Which funded Hitler.
[01:59:22.641 --> 01:59:26.483]  1832, founded the Skull and Bones Society, a Nazi death cult.
[01:59:28.044 --> 01:59:29.765]  Yeah, Hitler didn't invent anything.
[01:59:30.545 --> 01:59:32.466]  Hitler didn't bring up anything new, folks.
[01:59:34.667 --> 01:59:36.868]  Purely Illuminati preacher.
[01:59:39.749 --> 01:59:46.933]  But I'm sure most Americans know about the Nazi wealth, the hundreds of billions in diamond and gold, and how the Nazi families got to keep
[01:59:48.148 --> 01:59:52.752]  Even Mingala's family, quite wealthy, got to keep all of their land and factory holdings.
[01:59:53.472 --> 01:59:55.594]  Well, it turns out it's because of the Bushes.
[01:59:55.634 --> 01:59:57.095]  They were great helpers in all this.
[01:59:58.576 --> 02:00:00.738]  I guess it's all part of the Christian conservatism.
[02:00:02.139 --> 02:00:05.881]  Again, you're promoting everything you can imagine that's evil, but it's Christian and conservative.
[02:00:06.362 --> 02:00:07.082]  So that's coming up.
[02:00:07.142 --> 02:00:15.429]  Also a bunch of news about thought crime laws and open borders being pushed by the Republicans with the Democrats, and Wesley Clark wants a national ID card, so does Bush.
[02:00:15.469 --> 02:00:15.929]  I mean, it's just...
[02:00:16.903 --> 02:00:18.344]  Really, I'm frustrated today.
[02:00:18.384 --> 02:00:21.065]  There's no way for me to articulate all this properly.
[02:00:21.105 --> 02:00:22.286]  It's so horrible.
[02:00:22.887 --> 02:00:24.307]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:00:25.728 --> 02:00:29.230]  Let's go to Paula, then Ron, Eric, Robert, and others.
[02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:31.692]  Let's go to Paula first.
[02:00:32.772 --> 02:00:33.733]  Paula, welcome.
[02:00:33.753 --> 02:00:34.333]  You're on the air.
[02:00:34.353 --> 02:00:35.214]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:35.334 --> 02:00:36.394]  You're doing a great job.
[02:00:38.275 --> 02:00:41.597]  Someone had sent me an article, and it was in reference to Bush.
[02:00:41.637 --> 02:00:43.859]  He does not want... He does want...
[02:00:45.094 --> 02:00:48.004]  Open borders here, but he does not want open borders in Iraq.
[02:00:49.144 --> 02:00:49.945]  Did you know about that?
[02:00:50.005 --> 02:00:55.408]  They spent, oh, it was the Times of London, something like $30 billion to build a fence all the way around.
[02:00:55.808 --> 02:00:56.809]  They started it last year.
[02:00:56.849 --> 02:00:57.669]  It's almost done.
[02:00:57.689 --> 02:01:06.695]  With over 200 border checkpoints and trained border guards, you can't get a flea past that border into any of those countries.
[02:01:06.755 --> 02:01:13.499]  The stands over there, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, China, they're in the passes.
[02:01:13.879 --> 02:01:15.580]  But we can't have a border here.
[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:18.702]  And, yes, I was aware they've sealed the borders in Iraq.
[02:01:19.022 --> 02:01:24.847]  Yeah, well, it looks like our representatives are doing a good job going along with the corporations.
[02:01:25.587 --> 02:01:34.094]  Also, I sent another email from Toys R Us on their toysrus.com.
[02:01:34.354 --> 02:01:46.564]  There's a book there by a guy named David Riegel, and if you go to that toysrus.com, click onto a red box, it'll say children's books, and it'll pop you into a search engine.
[02:01:47.048 --> 02:01:53.133]  You type in Boy Lover, and there's only one book that comes up, and it's named Understanding Boys Loved and Boy Lover.
[02:01:55.095 --> 02:01:57.116]  And where did you hear about this?
[02:01:58.137 --> 02:02:00.219]  A friend sent me an email about that.
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:09.386]  And that particular website, Toys R Us, is connected also with Target, Borders, and Amazon.com.
[02:02:09.627 --> 02:02:11.108]  Well, I mean, what type of book is this?
[02:02:11.388 --> 02:02:13.430]  It's Boy Lover.
[02:02:13.610 --> 02:02:14.811]  It's connected with Mambla.
[02:02:15.367 --> 02:02:19.410]  Yeah, I think I heard of that book previously being on Amazon in a big protest.
[02:02:19.710 --> 02:02:21.812]  You're telling me that... Toys R Us.
[02:02:22.232 --> 02:02:22.912]  ...is selling it.
[02:02:23.613 --> 02:02:25.414]  Toys R Us and Target and Borders.
[02:02:25.854 --> 02:02:26.955]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:02:27.075 --> 02:02:27.636]  I'm serious.
[02:02:27.716 --> 02:02:28.476]  I can't handle this.
[02:02:28.936 --> 02:02:32.679]  And there was another guy, this guy I happened to hear on Art Bell.
[02:02:32.719 --> 02:02:36.522]  His name is Douglas Hageman, and he's with the Homeland Security.
[02:02:36.922 --> 02:02:42.806]  And he's trying to connect all of these atrocities that are happening in Iraq with...
[02:02:44.608 --> 02:02:52.373]  Well, he's trying to connect it with the Reichstag building during Hitler's time, and he's not saying anything about the United States.
[02:02:52.693 --> 02:02:54.794]  He's trying to connect all that with Iraq.
[02:02:56.055 --> 02:02:56.735]  I don't understand.
[02:02:56.795 --> 02:02:59.117]  If he's saying it's the Reichstag, then he's saying it's the government.
[02:02:59.437 --> 02:03:02.139]  Yes, but it's the government of Iraq and the United States.
[02:03:02.739 --> 02:03:05.621]  I can see it happening here.
[02:03:06.701 --> 02:03:08.803]  Well, it has been happening here.
[02:03:09.023 --> 02:03:13.345]  The illegitimate government's blowing stuff up and saying, you better give your rights up to us.
[02:03:13.365 --> 02:03:14.026]  Thanks for the call.
[02:03:15.322 --> 02:03:22.594]  We'll go to Ron and Eric and Robert and a few others, and then I'm going to... I'll tell you what.
[02:03:23.435 --> 02:03:25.719]  Ron and Eric and Robert and others, you're going to have to hold.
[02:03:25.739 --> 02:03:29.265]  I'm going to go ahead and cover the Nazi stuff when we get back, and then I'll go to your calls.
[02:03:33.012 --> 02:03:33.512]  We're good to go.
[02:03:54.271 --> 02:03:56.492]  The two most complete protein superfoods known.
[02:03:56.853 --> 02:03:59.314]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water.
[02:03:59.654 --> 02:04:06.798]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you to homeostasis.
[02:04:07.078 --> 02:04:10.760]  It's also very hydrating and, more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[02:04:11.041 --> 02:04:13.622]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[02:04:13.882 --> 02:04:18.825]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.

[02:04:33.624 --> 02:04:41.008]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:04:41.268 --> 02:04:46.010]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:51.873]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:04:52.113 --> 02:04:56.657]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:04:56.877 --> 02:05:04.023]  The casual society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:05:04.043 --> 02:05:08.586]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:05:08.746 --> 02:05:11.288]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:05:11.489 --> 02:05:18.194]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:05:18.434 --> 02:05:23.684]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:23.704 --> 02:05:24.125]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:32.526 --> 02:05:41.151]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:05:41.352 --> 02:05:52.638]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:05:52.859 --> 02:05:55.520]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:59.963]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:06:00.083 --> 02:06:00.623]  We're good to go.
[02:06:24.193 --> 02:06:25.294]  803-4438.
[02:06:25.354 --> 02:06:29.375]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:06:29.675 --> 02:06:31.015]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:06:33.376 --> 02:06:35.576]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:06:36.156 --> 02:06:39.017]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:42.038 --> 02:06:50.180]  There's a detailed article from the New Hampshire Gazette headlined, Bush Nazi dealings continued until 1951.
[02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:50.780]  Federal documents...
[02:06:53.872 --> 02:07:01.739]  Revealed by John Buchanan and Stacey Michael, after the seizures in late 1942 of five U.S.
[02:07:01.839 --> 02:07:19.833]  enterprises he managed on behalf of Nazi industrialists Fritz Thyssen, Prescott Bush, the grandfather of President George W., failed to divest himself of more than a dozen enemy national relationships that continued until his latest 1951 newly discovered U.S.
[02:07:20.214 --> 02:07:21.575]  government documents revealed
[02:07:22.378 --> 02:07:28.582]  Furthermore, the records show that Bush and his colleagues routinely attempted to conceal their activities from government investigators.
[02:07:29.202 --> 02:07:39.749]  Bush's partners in the secret web of Fison-controlled ventures included former New York Governor George Averell Harriman, skull and bones, and his younger brother E. Ronald Harriman.
[02:07:40.069 --> 02:07:48.515]  Their quarter-century of Nazi financial transactions from 1924 to 1951 were conducted by the New York private banking firm of Brown brother Harriman.
[02:07:49.602 --> 02:07:50.943]  He was taken into custody in 1942.
[02:08:19.090 --> 02:08:19.891]  We're good to go.
[02:08:40.353 --> 02:08:48.037]  On October 28, 1942, the same day two key Bush-Hareman-run businessmen were being seized, that's right, by the U.S.
[02:08:48.077 --> 02:08:53.300]  government, Harriman was meeting in London with Field Marshal Smuts to discuss the war effort.
[02:08:54.221 --> 02:08:55.322]  Denial and deceit.
[02:08:56.122 --> 02:09:01.125]  While Harriman was concealing his Nazi relationships from the government colleagues, Bernelius...
[02:09:01.989 --> 02:09:15.458]  Levens, the top executive of the interlocking German concerns, held under the corporate umbrella of Union Banking Corporation, reportedly tried to mislead investigators and was sometimes supported in his subterfuge by Brown brother Harriman.
[02:09:15.978 --> 02:09:27.906]  All of these assets of the UBC and its related businesses belong to the Fison-controlled enterprises, including the Bank of Vorhandel in Sweepenvart in Rotterdam, the documents state.
[02:09:29.148 --> 02:09:39.458]  And it goes on to say, nevertheless, it goes on for page after page, one of the final seizures in October 1950 concerned the U.S.
[02:09:39.578 --> 02:09:53.972]  assets of a Nazi baroness named Theresa Maria Ida Beckenhardt Humstad Stasilov Martania von Schwarzenberger.
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:57.462]  And you notice those are all royal names, by the way.
[02:09:57.582 --> 02:10:01.926]  And I'm mispronouncing some of them wrong, but I've read them many times in bloodline books.
[02:10:02.887 --> 02:10:06.790]  That Stanislav is royalty right there.
[02:10:07.410 --> 02:10:23.864]  Who were used, and it goes, who were also two shorter aliases, Brown Brother Harriman, where Prescott Bush and the Harrimans were partners attempted to convince government investigators the baroness had been a victim of Nazi persecution and therefore should be allowed to maintain her assets.
[02:10:25.058 --> 02:10:33.782]  And it says, it just goes on for page after page right through the 50s, hiding hundreds of billions of dollars of Nazi money in U.S.
[02:10:33.802 --> 02:10:34.583]  companies.
[02:10:36.684 --> 02:10:37.864]  It's just horrible, folks.
[02:10:38.905 --> 02:10:40.205]  I can't read all of it.
[02:10:40.225 --> 02:10:41.026]  We just don't have time.
[02:10:41.066 --> 02:10:45.008]  You want to go read it, it's on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:10:45.188 --> 02:10:50.110]  Here's a couple other articles, and then I'll go to all the callers that are patiently holding.
[02:10:51.167 --> 02:10:54.290]  Hatch joins Kennedy to push for a hate crimes bill.
[02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:55.671]  This is out of the Washington Times.
[02:10:55.751 --> 02:10:56.952]  Charlie Hurt wrote this.
[02:10:56.972 --> 02:11:09.021]  It says a new hate crimes proposal supported by Democrats and key Senate Republicans, including Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, would vastly expand the federal government's power to prosecute such crimes committed anywhere in the world.
[02:11:09.642 --> 02:11:11.083]  And again, it merges us with Europe.
[02:11:11.583 --> 02:11:14.846]  As the Supreme Court has said, we're under their laws now, under their precedence.
[02:11:15.807 --> 02:11:18.509]  And Europe's banning criticism of any group.
[02:11:19.452 --> 02:11:29.600]  Opponents of one of the most contentious provisions, the inclusion of sexual orientation as a protection category, have got to grow up, Mr. Hatch said in earlier negotiations.
[02:11:30.381 --> 02:11:38.508]  It goes on to say it actually punishes someone for what he or she thinks, said one Senate staffer, whose boss opposes any form of legislation.
[02:11:38.948 --> 02:11:40.029]  It's pretty scary.
[02:11:41.710 --> 02:11:44.673]  And it goes on to what Ashcroft has said before the ADL.
[02:11:46.082 --> 02:11:51.266]  They want to outlaw any type of criticism of any group because they say that fosters terrorism.
[02:11:51.306 --> 02:12:03.055]  It's the same line the EU has, the same line they have for passing all these laws, for arresting people in England who mildly criticize homosexuals or say the word homosexual.
[02:12:03.095 --> 02:12:04.836]  They say that's now a hate word.
[02:12:05.777 --> 02:12:07.178]  BBC article's on my website.
[02:12:08.829 --> 02:12:09.690]  And it's Orrin Hatch.
[02:12:09.730 --> 02:12:11.412]  He wants double the tuition for illegals.
[02:12:11.452 --> 02:12:16.036]  He wants Arnold to be able to be president, introduce a bill to repeal the 22nd Amendment to start that process.
[02:12:17.197 --> 02:12:19.739]  Hatch is involved in wanting open borders.
[02:12:19.879 --> 02:12:20.280]  Everything.
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:22.462]  Here's another one out of Arizona Republic.
[02:12:23.251 --> 02:12:25.332]  Clark likes McCain's migrant plan.
[02:12:25.372 --> 02:12:26.712]  It's also Bush's plan, I would add.
[02:12:27.193 --> 02:12:33.995]  Democratic presidential candidate Wesley Clark has more in common with Republican Senator John McCain than serving in Vietnam and seeking the White House.
[02:12:34.015 --> 02:12:50.822]  The retired Army general said Monday in Phoenix that he shares views similar to those of McCain and two other Arizonans, Republican Congressman Jim Kolb and Jeff Flake, who is a flake, who together are sponsoring a bill aimed at curbing undocumented immigration from Mexico by creating a guest worker program.
[02:12:51.542 --> 02:12:52.903]  Now therein lies the lie.
[02:12:54.346 --> 02:12:56.767]  Remember how they said Terri Schiavo was in a coma?
[02:12:57.567 --> 02:12:59.427]  She's got her eyes open, smiling at her mother.
[02:12:59.767 --> 02:13:02.248]  They're killing people who are talking, asking for food and water.
[02:13:02.268 --> 02:13:03.668]  We've covered the stories here.
[02:13:04.248 --> 02:13:04.648]  Admitted.
[02:13:05.348 --> 02:13:06.188]  Mainstream stuff.
[02:13:06.569 --> 02:13:07.969]  They still call you a vegetable.
[02:13:08.369 --> 02:13:08.889]  They kill you.
[02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:10.909]  The media lies and calls them vegetables.
[02:13:11.810 --> 02:13:14.950]  Here they lie and say that this bill will curb illegal immigration.
[02:13:16.791 --> 02:13:19.131]  And I guess, in a way, it's true.
[02:13:19.691 --> 02:13:22.672]  Because it's like Ashcroft says, hey, Patriot acts only for terrorists.
[02:13:22.732 --> 02:13:23.252]  I promise.
[02:13:25.009 --> 02:13:27.051]  Well, yeah, everything is an act of terror.
[02:13:27.291 --> 02:13:29.552]  Misdemeanors are an act of terror in Section 802.
[02:13:29.853 --> 02:13:31.554]  So in a way, that's true.
[02:13:33.755 --> 02:13:43.602]  You know, when they want to say that the surveillance cameras aren't going to be used here in Texas for law enforcement, as they're now being used, they'll go interview the Department of Transportation, and they'll say, no, it's not for law enforcement, it's for traffic.
[02:13:44.403 --> 02:13:49.306]  And then I said to the head guy, John Hurt, I said, yeah, but you're not in law enforcement.
[02:13:49.346 --> 02:13:51.548]  Your sister agency, Department of Public Safety, will.
[02:13:51.588 --> 02:13:53.009]  And he goes, oh, you ought to be a lawyer.
[02:13:53.309 --> 02:13:54.230]  Yes, that's true.
[02:13:54.250 --> 02:13:54.310]  See...
[02:13:55.185 --> 02:13:55.986]  That's how they do it.
[02:13:56.066 --> 02:14:03.672]  So here they're saying they're sponsoring a bill aimed at curbing undocumented immigration from Mexico by creating a guest worker program.
[02:14:04.553 --> 02:14:06.114]  So when lawyers speak, that's true.
[02:14:06.935 --> 02:14:08.196]  It'll curb undocumented.
[02:14:08.236 --> 02:14:10.958]  It'll curb illegal because it'll make them all legal.
[02:14:11.599 --> 02:14:12.539]  I've read the bill.
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:15.602]  If you can get here, folks, you'll be legalized.
[02:14:16.062 --> 02:14:20.326]  This is blanket total amnesty for millions that are here and millions more on their way.
[02:14:21.577 --> 02:14:27.778]  A parallel proposed by Senator John Conyers, Republican, Texas, is considered less flexible.
[02:14:27.898 --> 02:14:35.000]  Of the two, I like McCain's proposal, Clark said, after meeting with veterans at the Carl T. Hayden Veterans Administration Medical Center.
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:45.682]  I'm not endorsing every aspect of the proposal, Clark said, but I think we need a guest worker program that brings people into this country in a way that's fair, that protects their rights, that meets our labor needs.
[02:14:45.942 --> 02:14:46.862]  Our labor needs.
[02:14:49.003 --> 02:14:51.183]  And I would just add to all of this that
[02:14:54.086 --> 02:14:57.847]  40% of the Marine Corps now came here illegally.
[02:14:58.347 --> 02:15:10.591]  Did you know, that's an official statistic, 40% of the Marine Corps, I didn't even know this, and I read this the other day in the Associated Press, were not citizens, either became citizens or weren't citizens and were given citizenship.
[02:15:11.511 --> 02:15:16.973]  Over 20,000 of the troops in Iraq are illegal aliens, and they're given citizenship.
[02:15:18.393 --> 02:15:24.380]  A foreign army, folks, in more ways than one, and it's all around New York and D.C.
[02:15:26.102 --> 02:15:30.927]  A few other articles, then we'll go to Eric and Ron and others.
[02:15:31.007 --> 02:15:33.630]  Police seize rental truck with TNT traces.
[02:15:33.690 --> 02:15:38.096]  Fox News, a budget truck was pulled over in Oak Harbor, Washington, near the...
[02:15:39.315 --> 02:15:40.256]  We're good to go.
[02:16:08.775 --> 02:16:13.339]  Shortly after, federal officials say the local police pulled the vehicle over for speeding.
[02:16:13.379 --> 02:16:19.224]  Documents read by Fox News indicate that the driver and passenger pulled the police that they were delivering furniture from California.
[02:16:19.544 --> 02:16:22.166]  Authorities doubted the story because of the early morning hour.
[02:16:23.067 --> 02:16:27.351]  And it goes on to say that both the driver and the passenger were Israeli nationals.
[02:16:27.411 --> 02:16:29.292]  It just goes on and on.
[02:16:31.294 --> 02:16:33.356]  How many times have you heard about stuff like that happening?
[02:16:34.306 --> 02:16:34.666]  We're good to go.
[02:16:34.686 --> 02:16:35.507]  We're good to go.
[02:17:05.638 --> 02:17:08.419]  And I got a bunch of police state news here.
[02:17:08.939 --> 02:17:11.180]  We'll have to come back and go to calls and then get to that.
[02:17:12.841 --> 02:17:22.124]  I got a whole stack of news where veterans signed up for a parade peacefully with their peace signs, and they had Hooters girls, and they had local high school bands.
[02:17:22.164 --> 02:17:26.305]  Anybody who wanted to be in it could, but the police came over and said, the crowd doesn't like you.
[02:17:26.325 --> 02:17:27.166]  They actually said this.
[02:17:27.266 --> 02:17:27.886]  It's in the paper.
[02:17:28.466 --> 02:17:30.207]  The crowd doesn't like you.
[02:17:31.047 --> 02:17:33.748]  You'll be arrested if you don't get over to the side of the street.
[02:17:35.296 --> 02:17:36.597]  That's your new America, folks.
[02:17:37.577 --> 02:17:40.278]  That's what the veterans fought for, so you can't march in a parade.
[02:17:41.619 --> 02:17:42.799]  But the Hooters girls can't.
[02:17:44.700 --> 02:18:00.787]  And you heard callers talk about these talk radio shows, how they screen out the callers, how you can't get on board these shows, how they censor you, how you've got to lie to get on to counter the fact that Bush is not a conservative, that he's a gun-grabbing, open-borders-promoting, New World Order puppet.
[02:18:02.682 --> 02:18:11.267]  But here we are on this show on dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of AM and FM stations, shortwave, one of the biggest internet listening audiences.
[02:18:12.227 --> 02:18:13.388]  Where are the people that disagree?
[02:18:14.268 --> 02:18:23.573]  No, they just have a handful of idiots that call into these mainstream shows and regurgitate the same thing in a mindless love fest as the country's being totally destroyed!
[02:18:27.515 --> 02:18:30.417]  Ashcroft wants to arrest you for your speech, people!
[02:18:33.078 --> 02:18:34.859]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:18:34.879 --> 02:18:37.401]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:19:01.318 --> 02:19:06.103]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[02:20:32.287 --> 02:20:35.949]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:20:36.349 --> 02:20:41.773]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:20:42.253 --> 02:20:43.333]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:20:43.373 --> 02:20:47.436]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:20:48.056 --> 02:21:01.324]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:21:01.863 --> 02:21:07.165]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.

[02:21:31.431 --> 02:21:35.833]  This is Joyce Riley, and most of you know I've searched for over five years to find something to help the vets.
[02:21:36.174 --> 02:21:38.055]  Well, I've found something that will help everybody.
[02:21:38.455 --> 02:21:44.238]  Miracle-2 soap, neutralizer gel, and skin moisturizer have prompted testimonies from people all over the country.

[02:22:19.708 --> 02:22:20.128]  It's a miracle.
[02:22:45.169 --> 02:22:46.150]  Let's go to calls.
[02:22:46.270 --> 02:22:47.190]  Ron in New York.
[02:22:47.491 --> 02:22:54.315]  What do you think of the last 30 minutes you've been holding while I went through all this just insane news?
[02:22:54.775 --> 02:23:07.303]  Well, Alex, what I think is what you've gone through, I know for a fact is true because I've done the research myself even prior to hearing it on your show.
[02:23:07.343 --> 02:23:09.164]  So I know you're telling the public the truth.
[02:23:09.884 --> 02:23:12.806]  I also think the technique that's used is
[02:23:13.658 --> 02:23:18.640]  This New World Order oligarch hits us with so many things at once.
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:21.261]  Sort of like a shotgun tactic.
[02:23:21.361 --> 02:23:23.362]  If you fire a... A blitzkrieg.
[02:23:23.622 --> 02:23:23.842]  Right.
[02:23:23.862 --> 02:23:34.466]  If you fire pellets out of a shotgun round, there's so many that despite your best attempts to fend off some of the pellets, many of them will eventually hit.
[02:23:34.746 --> 02:23:35.607]  This is what they do.
[02:23:35.667 --> 02:23:37.568]  They saturate the public mind.
[02:23:38.108 --> 02:23:40.909]  They saturate the national mentality with so many things.
[02:23:41.465 --> 02:23:47.129]  That even if people are inclined to oppose this, there are so many things to fight, they can't do it all at once.
[02:23:47.249 --> 02:23:53.453]  Ron, I probably watch an hour of TV a week, and that's probably an exaggeration, probably less.
[02:23:53.854 --> 02:23:56.395]  Every time I turn it on, it's New World Order propaganda.
[02:23:56.736 --> 02:23:57.396]  Everything!
[02:23:57.476 --> 02:23:59.037]  How can people not see this?
[02:23:59.057 --> 02:24:10.085]  Sanctioned brutality, official sanctioned brutality, where it shows you people in enforcement capacities, legitimate, well, supposedly legitimate enforcement capacities, torturing, beatings,
[02:24:11.054 --> 02:24:15.156]  We've got one here, a police movie with some bald-headed jerk on Fox.
[02:24:15.176 --> 02:24:15.876]  I don't even watch it.
[02:24:15.896 --> 02:24:17.857]  It shows him beating prisoners up all the time.
[02:24:18.157 --> 02:24:19.137]  This is unbelievable.
[02:24:19.638 --> 02:24:26.040]  They keep saturating people with this so they will come to accept this behavior when it actually occurs.
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:31.082]  Now, I would like to get on to something, just a little bit of humor for one second.
[02:24:31.442 --> 02:24:33.903]  You mentioned that woman with all those titled names.
[02:24:34.424 --> 02:24:39.085]  Pretty soon she'll probably have the name Von Schwarzenegger, too, attached onto her name.
[02:24:39.326 --> 02:24:40.366]  It's one you didn't read off.
[02:24:41.027 --> 02:24:44.546]  But that aside, you were talking about these mind-reader devices.
[02:24:44.908 --> 02:24:45.089]  Alex.
[02:24:46.044 --> 02:24:49.367]  I've had a little bit of experience with what I call these P.T.
[02:24:49.427 --> 02:24:51.789]  Barnum devices, because that's really what they are.
[02:24:51.809 --> 02:24:57.054]  Well, that's what I've said, and I meant to mention that, Ron, is that we've already proved the lie detector doesn't work.
[02:24:57.434 --> 02:25:02.079]  Now they've got something with all these bells and whistles, and they say it shows you're a terrorist.
[02:25:02.119 --> 02:25:03.440]  They actually say that.
[02:25:03.620 --> 02:25:05.361]  They're mounting them in airports.
[02:25:05.802 --> 02:25:11.707]  Alex, in fact, those devices don't really work, and that mind reader will never really read a mind.
[02:25:11.767 --> 02:25:12.428]  But you know what?
[02:25:12.972 --> 02:25:16.773]  From the New World Order perspective, it works in this respect.
[02:25:18.053 --> 02:25:26.295]  They make the mass of people believe that they have the technical capability to read their minds so that they can cow the people.
[02:25:26.916 --> 02:25:29.576]  They can make the people believe that they're all powerful.
[02:25:29.596 --> 02:25:31.017]  I've got to stop you again, Ron.
[02:25:31.037 --> 02:25:31.957]  You're making a good point.
[02:25:32.977 --> 02:25:34.457]  Look, understand, folks.
[02:25:34.517 --> 02:25:35.758]  I'm looking at BBC.
[02:25:36.058 --> 02:25:39.359]  I'm looking at San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:25:39.559 --> 02:25:40.439]  In the last two days...
[02:25:41.255 --> 02:25:43.176]  Two years ago, they put them in five airports.
[02:25:43.196 --> 02:25:44.638]  They're going in all the British airports.
[02:25:44.738 --> 02:25:47.500]  An MRI scanning your brain.
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:50.462]  You've got assigned forms to allow them to do that at the hospital.
[02:25:50.482 --> 02:25:55.305]  Folks, do you realize how nuts this is?
[02:25:57.147 --> 02:25:57.587]  Go ahead.
[02:25:57.707 --> 02:26:00.909]  So they cow the people into believing they work.
[02:26:01.570 --> 02:26:04.032]  And in addition, it has a second benefit.
[02:26:04.992 --> 02:26:08.535]  Most of the companies that make these PT Bonham devices...
[02:26:09.511 --> 02:26:13.772]  If you look at it and you trace the record back... Military-industrial complex.
[02:26:13.812 --> 02:26:14.792]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:26:14.832 --> 02:26:18.573]  So they're making not just millions, Alex, billions off of this.
[02:26:18.613 --> 02:26:28.615]  Could you imagine what a beautiful thing, in one motion, I could make you cow to me and then rob you of billions of dollars because it's your tax dollars that are paying for these machines.
[02:26:28.635 --> 02:26:30.115]  Well, this is what they say they do with them.
[02:26:30.135 --> 02:26:30.935]  This is what they say.
[02:26:31.396 --> 02:26:32.516]  And they don't really read my mind.
[02:26:32.536 --> 02:26:35.256]  Let me describe these machines because I've got the articles right here.
[02:26:35.276 --> 02:26:36.357]  We've been covering it for two years.
[02:26:36.897 --> 02:26:38.017]  It's got one camera...
[02:26:38.718 --> 02:26:39.259]  We're good to go.
[02:26:59.202 --> 02:26:59.743]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:27:18.533 --> 02:27:21.734]  They really can't tell from your brain waves if you're lying.
[02:27:21.754 --> 02:27:23.114]  No, I know it's a scam.
[02:27:23.154 --> 02:27:25.195]  I know it's a scam.
[02:27:25.635 --> 02:27:34.457]  The way they'll find out if you're lying or not is by that interrogation, and by the way, determining whether somebody's a threat by the way they walk or something.
[02:27:35.098 --> 02:27:36.478]  It's not even a scientist.
[02:27:36.498 --> 02:27:38.238]  It's an art called proxematics.
[02:27:38.478 --> 02:27:39.279]  I studied it.
[02:27:39.879 --> 02:27:42.940]  It's one small step above voodoo.
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:44.500]  It's almost worthless.
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:46.741]  Believe me, they're playing games in that.
[02:27:46.781 --> 02:27:47.801]  They're making people think,
[02:27:48.399 --> 02:27:49.780]  That they have the power and the wisdom of God.
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:51.241]  Well, that's what I've said, Ron.
[02:27:51.281 --> 02:27:52.321]  And they're robbing you.
[02:27:52.881 --> 02:27:54.022]  That's what I've said all along.
[02:27:54.142 --> 02:28:01.106]  But look, they've gone from the dials and levers of a lie detector moving on to this.
[02:28:01.246 --> 02:28:06.849]  Well, Alex, didn't in ancient Egypt the old pharaoh use magicians to fool the Hebrews?
[02:28:07.189 --> 02:28:08.930]  Try to, so that they wouldn't leave?
[02:28:09.631 --> 02:28:12.833]  We still have the Pharaoh, and we still have the magicians.
[02:28:12.853 --> 02:28:14.854]  It's just they use electronics today.
[02:28:15.195 --> 02:28:15.955]  I agree with you.
[02:28:16.075 --> 02:28:17.336]  It just bugs.
[02:28:18.497 --> 02:28:19.978]  Thanks for the call.
[02:28:20.018 --> 02:28:20.718]  It's out of control.
[02:28:20.758 --> 02:28:22.059]  We'll be back with more calls, more news.
[02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:24.380]  We're on the march.
[02:28:24.881 --> 02:28:26.482]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:28:27.402 --> 02:28:30.104]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:33.277 --> 02:28:36.099]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:28:36.239 --> 02:28:37.040]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:40.503]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:28:40.683 --> 02:28:46.347]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:28:46.487 --> 02:28:49.510]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:28:49.770 --> 02:28:54.052]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:28:54.232 --> 02:28:56.133]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[02:28:56.253 --> 02:29:03.317]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again, with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:29:03.517 --> 02:29:05.978]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:29:06.278 --> 02:29:08.959]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[02:29:09.119 --> 02:29:10.600]  Only this time it changed my life.
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:12.640]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:14.841]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[02:29:14.901 --> 02:29:17.462]  Well, that was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[02:29:17.502 --> 02:29:20.203]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[02:29:20.403 --> 02:29:20.943]  Side effects?
[02:29:21.103 --> 02:29:23.384]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[02:29:23.524 --> 02:29:25.024]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[02:29:25.044 --> 02:29:25.244]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[02:29:25.365 --> 02:29:26.805]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:29:26.825 --> 02:29:27.305]  It worked for me.
[02:29:32.947 --> 02:29:33.468]  We're good to go.
[02:29:53.168 --> 02:30:05.600]  www.vacationa2z.com A membership in vacationa2z.com will not only land you huge savings on air and hotel, you'll be treated to discounts of 10-80% on car rentals, golf, movies and theme parks.

[02:30:10.285 --> 02:30:10.985]  Not convinced yet?

[02:30:15.269 --> 02:30:16.130]  We're good to go.
[02:30:32.208 --> 02:30:34.190]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:30:34.270 --> 02:30:34.930]  Hello, folks.
[02:30:35.050 --> 02:30:44.979]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.

[02:31:38.175 --> 02:31:40.076]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:31:40.557 --> 02:31:43.379]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:51.484]  Again, folks, they've announced drones have ground-penetrating radar, that the Army and the police are going to look through your walls.
[02:31:51.504 --> 02:31:53.005]  It's been going on for five years.
[02:31:53.926 --> 02:31:58.709]  That your digital cable box listens to you with an audio microphone hooked into the federal government.
[02:31:59.690 --> 02:32:07.095]  That's mainstream news, that they're going to put up base-scanning cameras everywhere, make you thumb-scan to buy and sell, but leave the borders wide open.
[02:32:08.061 --> 02:32:08.581]  We're good to go.
[02:32:08.601 --> 02:32:09.161]  We're good to go.
[02:32:38.411 --> 02:32:43.853]  But before we go any further, yesterday I heard John Stattmiller doing a show from 4 to 6.
[02:32:45.193 --> 02:32:59.718]  And about five years ago, I have read on air, I know John had done it from time to time too, an Army manual from the 1920s about our government, about the difference between a democracy and a republic, and how this operates.
[02:32:59.758 --> 02:33:03.819]  So I got John back up for here at the end of the show, and I appreciate him doing it on short notice.
[02:33:03.839 --> 02:33:06.620]  I'm going to have him back up next week to spend an hour or two on this.
[02:33:07.526 --> 02:33:12.047]  Maybe Saturday on our show, we do Saturdays 1 to 4 Central, we'll do this again.
[02:33:12.927 --> 02:33:15.167]  Because this is so important, folks.
[02:33:15.207 --> 02:33:15.948]  It's so important.
[02:33:15.968 --> 02:33:33.691]  But before we go to John and cover this and show you how much our government and our media and our culture and our military has changed, before we do this, I mean, I haven't really properly promoted my videos, my books, the items we sell that support this show today.
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:36.742]  I've made ten documentary films.
[02:33:36.803 --> 02:33:38.645]  I carry some other documentaries.
[02:33:38.765 --> 02:33:40.948]  I carry some other books by other great authors.
[02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:46.095]  I've published a book for Paul Watson, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror and the New World Order.
[02:33:46.155 --> 02:33:46.816]  It's excellent.
[02:33:46.856 --> 02:33:47.517]  It's wonderful.
[02:33:47.577 --> 02:33:48.278]  It's informative.
[02:33:48.559 --> 02:33:49.300]  It's dynamic.
[02:33:50.556 --> 02:33:53.060]  I've written my own book, 9-11 Descent into Tyranny.
[02:33:53.500 --> 02:34:06.959]  My new film is Matrix of Evil with Ron Paul saying globalists run Washington and Cynthia McKinney about the UN-run white slavery rings and Colonel Craig Roberts and Frank Morales, police state expert, and myself.
[02:34:08.502 --> 02:34:15.866]  Such an exciting video, and nobody's going to see it, nobody's going to know about it, unless you order it, unless you make copies of it, unless you get it out to people.
[02:34:15.906 --> 02:34:18.308]  We need your help to fight the New World Order.
[02:34:18.828 --> 02:34:21.109]  And I authorize you to make copies of my videos.
[02:34:21.129 --> 02:34:22.030]  Who else does that?
[02:34:23.350 --> 02:34:26.532]  Because through you, we have power to effect change.
[02:34:26.652 --> 02:34:31.295]  So, the videos are $25.95 a piece, all over two hours, professionally produced.
[02:34:32.275 --> 02:34:34.396]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[02:34:34.977 --> 02:34:36.978]  You get big discounts when you get multiple books.
[02:34:38.721 --> 02:34:45.387]  Go to InfoWars.com, go to PrisonPlanet.com, or call toll-free to order these items at 1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:45.407 --> 02:34:48.349]  That's 888-253-3139, or InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:35:02.956 --> 02:35:03.817]  Don't wait.
[02:35:04.017 --> 02:35:04.998]  Make the call now.
[02:35:05.118 --> 02:35:06.619]  Blow the phones off a wall.
[02:35:07.220 --> 02:35:08.160]  Get the videos.
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:09.902]  Melt your VCRs down.
[02:35:10.222 --> 02:35:11.623]  Hand them out to everybody.
[02:35:11.643 --> 02:35:11.983]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:12.003 --> 02:35:14.785]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:35:25.954 --> 02:35:26.675]  It's real simple.
[02:35:26.695 --> 02:35:36.121]  If we don't expose that a bunch of sicko terrorists run the world government and are totally ruthless, and if we don't expose that they're going to carry out more terror, it's over real quick, folks.
[02:35:37.822 --> 02:35:38.922]  So find out the truth.
[02:35:39.022 --> 02:35:39.723]  Get the videos.
[02:35:39.743 --> 02:35:40.263]  Get the books.
[02:35:40.303 --> 02:35:42.285]  Get them out to everybody and support this show.
[02:35:43.305 --> 02:35:46.187]  John Stettmiller, thanks for coming on on short notice.
[02:35:47.128 --> 02:35:49.149]  Tell us about this particular item you've got.
[02:35:49.767 --> 02:35:53.069]  We've covered it before, but every few years we bring it back into circulation.
[02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:54.650]  Why is this so important?
[02:36:11.451 --> 02:36:11.992]  We're good to go.
[02:36:30.270 --> 02:36:41.410]  Well, the Founding Fathers knew of the pratfalls and the pitfalls of a democracy, and they knew that people would vote out of largus, or in other words, out of the government treasury, everything and anything, and they would eventually bankrupt it.
[02:36:41.989 --> 02:36:53.296]  Well, the Founding Fathers knew differently, and evidently so did the fine folks that did the training manuals for our troops back in the 20s.
[02:36:53.416 --> 02:37:03.382]  And the training manual that you mentioned, the number is 2000-25, and it was published by the then War Department, it's now the Department of Defense, in Washington, D.C.
[02:37:03.442 --> 02:37:04.042]  on November 30th of 1928.
[02:37:06.227 --> 02:37:07.509]  And they make the distinction.
[02:37:07.809 --> 02:37:10.072]  Now, here's an important thing to remember, folks.
[02:37:10.112 --> 02:37:24.348]  When servicemen or politicians or anybody raises their hand in a public ceremony or an oath of affirmation swearing to God to uphold the Constitution, its principles against enemies both foreign and domestic,
[02:37:24.707 --> 02:37:25.067]  We're good to go.
[02:37:25.087 --> 02:37:25.327]  I think?
[02:37:54.655 --> 02:37:57.136]  Versus a democracy versus a republic.
[02:37:57.336 --> 02:38:13.781]  And I want the police to listen to this and understand, just because they've taken this out of circulation, just because they don't teach this, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, our heritage, our system is still there, and you are sworn to uphold this, John.
[02:38:14.181 --> 02:38:16.982]  And it doesn't have anything to do with department policy.
[02:38:17.282 --> 02:38:22.804]  That's an obligation not only as a human being, a man, a man in uniform, a protectorate,
[02:38:23.337 --> 02:38:23.997]  We're good to go.
[02:38:44.583 --> 02:39:02.936]  Attitude towards law is that the will of the majority shall regulate, whether it's based upon deliberation or governed by passion, prejudice, impulse, without restraint or regard, to consequences that results in demagoguism, license, agitation, discontent, and eventual anarchy.
[02:39:03.296 --> 02:39:08.440]  Now, here's what the training manual for our fine soldiers said about the republic.
[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:13.964]  Authority is derived through the election by the people of public officials best fitted to represent them.
[02:39:14.525 --> 02:39:14.925]  Thank you.
[02:39:38.772 --> 02:39:41.154]  Now, it is the standard form of government throughout the world.
[02:39:41.194 --> 02:40:01.833]  A republic is a form of government under a constitution which provides for the election of the executive, the legislative, who working together in a representative capacity have all the power of appointment, all power of legislation, all power to raise revenue and appropriate expenditures, and are required to create the judiciary to pass upon the justice and legality
[02:40:02.273 --> 02:40:03.794]  Now, this was done by Order of Secretary of War C.P.
[02:40:03.814 --> 02:40:09.096]  Summerall, Major General, Chief of Staff, and also Lutz Wall, the Major General and the Adjutant General.
[02:40:29.534 --> 02:40:39.521]  Now, the interesting thing about this is that once Franklin Delano Roosevelt got into power, he immediately ordered all these manuals destroyed.
[02:40:40.401 --> 02:40:45.985]  Now, Alex, here we're talking about the 1930s when Franklin Delano Roosevelt was in office.
[02:40:46.365 --> 02:40:48.467]  This was a maxim for our country.
[02:40:48.507 --> 02:40:57.232]  This is what the founding fathers specifically, I mean, they went into great detail why they chose this republican form of government versus a democracy.
[02:40:57.593 --> 02:40:58.273]  They knew better.
[02:40:59.324 --> 02:41:13.486]  So when we had the New Deal guy come around here, well, that flew in the face of what they wanted to accomplish, you know, to do the social engineering to destroy this country's great founding documents and turn this into a direct expression.
[02:41:14.262 --> 02:41:17.603]  Over prejudice or of the minute necessity or whatever.
[02:41:17.643 --> 02:41:19.164]  In other words, a democracy.
[02:41:19.244 --> 02:41:21.545]  So what they do is the bankers own the media.
[02:41:22.025 --> 02:41:27.887]  They tell the people, hey, we're going to give you a bunch of welfare and corporate welfare if you vote for big government.
[02:41:28.208 --> 02:41:32.069]  They vote for big government to confiscate the wealth of the middle class, which is happening.
[02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:39.712]  And then after they're done enslaving people, they move into tyranny or an autocracy where you have centralized government.
[02:41:40.152 --> 02:41:41.933]  And this is what the Army was teaching.
[02:41:41.973 --> 02:41:43.814]  This is what the Founding Fathers said in debates.
[02:41:43.874 --> 02:41:45.735]  It's what was published in the newspapers.
[02:41:46.055 --> 02:41:58.202]  It's what everybody understood until just a few decades ago, and now it's democracy, democracy from Rush Limbaugh and George Bush and Bill Clinton and Hillary and Wesley Clark in a democracy.
[02:41:59.308 --> 02:42:08.092]  If 51% say we want to make it illegal to have a peace march or illegal to criticize homosexuals or illegal to hunt, it happens.
[02:42:08.553 --> 02:42:10.834]  Do you understand the difference, folks?
[02:42:11.234 --> 02:42:15.576]  In a democracy, if 51% of us say, let's kill all the blacks, it happens.
[02:42:16.016 --> 02:42:18.437]  John, what happens in a republic if somebody says that?
[02:42:18.697 --> 02:42:24.240]  Well, in a republic, no harm, no foul, because a republic would follow more along the common path.
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:36.208]  Common law standards, in other words, if you cause no harm or no foul, but of course that's what the homosexual lobby says, just by speaking openly against homosexuality, that you're somehow causing them pain.
[02:42:36.408 --> 02:42:37.489]  It's not even that now, John.
[02:42:37.529 --> 02:42:39.730]  If you say the word homosexual in England, you're arrested.
[02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:40.751]  They say that's a hate word.
[02:42:41.051 --> 02:42:51.578]  Well, and the way this republic worked, now if you notice that they say that authority is derived through the election of the people, of public officials best fitted to represent them.
[02:42:52.236 --> 02:42:57.721]  Time was in this country, and folks, make no mistake about this, they keep talking about the Constitution.
[02:42:57.781 --> 02:42:59.903]  Well, it's an outmoded, outdated document.
[02:43:00.363 --> 02:43:03.947]  No, it's not, because mankind has not changed in the last couple hundred years.
[02:43:04.067 --> 02:43:05.288]  It was a new idea.
[02:43:05.368 --> 02:43:08.291]  What they're replacing it with is tyranny, the old idea.
[02:43:08.611 --> 02:43:09.131]  There you go.
[02:43:09.292 --> 02:43:10.633]  And why this worked...
[02:43:11.013 --> 02:43:11.313]  The game rules!
[02:43:11.333 --> 02:43:12.154]  It bound the politicians.
[02:43:12.174 --> 02:43:13.975]  In other words, it had to pass a constitutional litmus test.
[02:43:13.995 --> 02:43:15.616]  You couldn't propose legislation or vote on it.
[02:43:29.725 --> 02:43:30.585]  We're good to go.
[02:43:48.053 --> 02:43:48.733]  We're good to go.
[02:43:48.753 --> 02:43:48.933]  I think?
[02:44:09.542 --> 02:44:15.785]  Twenty years ago, we wouldn't be talking about liberalism because what did Khrushchev say about being a liberal in this country?
[02:44:15.805 --> 02:44:18.066]  A reporter had asked him, what about the communists, sir?
[02:44:18.086 --> 02:44:18.846]  He said, no, no, no, no.
[02:44:19.266 --> 02:44:20.647]  Here we don't call them communists.
[02:44:20.727 --> 02:44:21.787]  We call them liberals.
[02:44:22.087 --> 02:44:23.788]  Here's the difference between the left and right.
[02:44:25.485 --> 02:44:27.587]  With the neocons and the liberals and the socialists.
[02:44:27.687 --> 02:44:33.452]  The only difference is they set the table a little bit different, but the dishes that we're eating are the exact same thing.
[02:44:33.973 --> 02:44:34.633]  It is.
[02:44:34.954 --> 02:44:38.517]  And a lot of people don't understand that they're looking around in the world today.
[02:44:38.577 --> 02:44:42.260]  They're looking at their life in the United States.
[02:44:42.300 --> 02:44:48.126]  And Alex, I'm 50 years old now, and what I have seen transpire in this country just in the last half century...
[02:44:48.576 --> 02:44:56.540]  It is so far away from the Republican form of government and the ideals and the maxims of law.
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:04.384]  The law, if it didn't work for the individual, it certainly wouldn't work for the collective, as we've heard a lot of people talk about.
[02:45:04.804 --> 02:45:13.008]  And people, they forgot what form of government that gave us these rights and these freedoms and these liberties, and now we're shifting away from that.
[02:45:14.169 --> 02:45:23.762]  Alex, just a few minutes ago, I'd heard on the news that Judge Roy Moore, the courts in Louisiana just bounced Judge Roy Moore out.
[02:45:24.512 --> 02:45:31.814]  And what they got him on was the conflict that he was having about him sticking to the maxims of God's law.
[02:45:32.174 --> 02:45:33.395]  Well, this is what they said.
[02:45:34.155 --> 02:45:41.857]  He violated judicial ethics, so therefore Judge Roy Moore is no longer a judge in Alabama.
[02:45:42.377 --> 02:45:47.339]  And they're banning nativity scenes, but you can have the menorah, you can have the pumpkin.
[02:45:48.220 --> 02:45:50.222]  You can have whatever other religion you want.
[02:45:51.222 --> 02:45:58.249]  There are reports in mainstream news where in school they'll find a Bible in a backpack.
[02:45:58.269 --> 02:45:59.370]  They'll throw it in the trash.
[02:45:59.591 --> 02:46:00.291]  This is in the news.
[02:46:00.712 --> 02:46:04.235]  Send the young girl to the principal where they're threatened by police.
[02:46:05.857 --> 02:46:12.203]  It's wall to wall, and now Hatch and Kennedy have got a new hate crime bill for your speech.
[02:46:13.491 --> 02:46:17.254]  John, it's happening right now in front of us.
[02:46:17.334 --> 02:46:20.957]  Some peace veterans had signed up to march in the parade.
[02:46:20.997 --> 02:46:24.460]  The police walked up and said, the crowd doesn't like it that you're here.
[02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:26.042]  We'll arrest you if you don't get out of line.
[02:46:26.462 --> 02:46:28.484]  I mean, that shows how warped we are.
[02:46:28.504 --> 02:46:35.130]  Alex, you know where most people get their political perspectives is off of the sound-bited news.
[02:46:35.890 --> 02:46:39.894]  And generally this is sensationalized, lacking in a lot of facts.
[02:46:40.330 --> 02:46:49.295]  And this is how people are governing themselves, their passions, if you will, in regards to things that should be logically reasoned out.
[02:46:50.295 --> 02:46:57.359]  Instead, we've got this snap, crackle, pop type of psychology, this pop culture, and everything is in sound bites.
[02:46:57.659 --> 02:47:04.902]  Look, Alex, 50% of the people they did in this poll prior to Judge Moore's removal from the Alabama Supreme Court
[02:47:07.052 --> 02:47:12.014]  50% of the people said that, yes, the Ten Commandments should be taken down from all government buildings.
[02:47:12.074 --> 02:47:14.014]  Half the people agreed, half disagreed.
[02:47:14.415 --> 02:47:16.915]  That shows you the shift in this country.
[02:47:17.375 --> 02:47:21.857]  People are not familiar with their country, why their Constitution was important.
[02:47:21.897 --> 02:47:33.061]  They don't know that it goes, this is where our law grows from, Mosaic Law, Magna Carta 1214, Declaration of Independence 1776, Constitution, Bill of Rights 1789.
[02:47:34.731 --> 02:47:41.395]  And Alex, the founding fathers, they weren't all church-going, knee-bending Christians.
[02:47:42.256 --> 02:47:42.996]  Some of them weren't.
[02:47:43.236 --> 02:47:44.097]  A lot of them were.
[02:47:44.517 --> 02:47:51.762]  They understood morality and ethics and what an important part that plays in a country's culture and its society.
[02:47:52.382 --> 02:47:55.004]  If it's not nurtured and allowed to grow and flourish...
[02:47:55.684 --> 02:47:57.184]  The body dies.
[02:47:57.384 --> 02:48:00.085]  Well, look, corruption just doesn't end at one spot.
[02:48:00.105 --> 02:48:09.927]  It either gets worse or it gets better, and we're getting worse, folks, and they're setting up a system to go after good people and to raise up and protect evil people.
[02:48:10.187 --> 02:48:13.467]  Well, Alex, let me ask you a simple question and listeners to your program.
[02:48:13.867 --> 02:48:22.149]  Would you much rather go up in front of a judge that believes in God, that believes that if he does not recognize God and adhere to those principles...
[02:48:22.717 --> 02:48:26.302]  And that is the highest law of the universe, let alone this land.
[02:48:26.682 --> 02:48:39.980]  Would you much rather go in front of a judge that has a conscience and knows the difference between right and wrong and adheres to those principles, or would you much rather go up in front of a secular judge that doesn't know where morality or ethics came from?
[02:48:40.140 --> 02:48:40.961]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:48:41.021 --> 02:48:45.945]  If I'm a good person, I want to go up before the judge that you first mentioned.
[02:48:45.965 --> 02:48:51.750]  If I'm a bad person, I'll go before the evil one because he'll release me, which they do, and then imprison the good people.
[02:48:51.810 --> 02:48:54.953]  And there's another point to all of this.
[02:48:55.393 --> 02:49:01.695]  You're going to have a God, folks, whether it's sex or drugs or materialism or Satanism or the New Age.
[02:49:02.055 --> 02:49:04.256]  What God is it going to be?
[02:49:04.736 --> 02:49:06.977]  What fruits do these other gods bear?
[02:49:07.397 --> 02:49:13.739]  So if we don't have God above the government who gives us these rights, then the government becomes God and can take away those rights.
[02:49:13.999 --> 02:49:15.019]  And that's what's happening.
[02:49:15.919 --> 02:49:16.500]  Absolutely.
[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:17.600]  Alex, thank you.
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:20.941]  I'll see you this Saturday on Real Talk Radio from 1 to 4 p.m.
[02:49:21.461 --> 02:49:23.342]  Hey, thanks a lot for coming on, John, with that.
[02:49:25.481 --> 02:49:32.006]  Tell you what, we'll come right back and talk to Eric in Connecticut and a couple others and hit a few final news items.
[02:49:33.387 --> 02:49:37.730]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:42.353]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:42.494 --> 02:49:46.877]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:49:46.917 --> 02:49:48.218]  The New World Order.
[02:49:50.026 --> 02:49:54.248]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:54.308 --> 02:50:01.231]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:50:01.371 --> 02:50:03.412]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:50:03.772 --> 02:50:06.814]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[02:50:06.994 --> 02:50:07.294]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:50:07.334 --> 02:50:08.455]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:50:32.794 --> 02:50:40.301]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[02:50:40.581 --> 02:50:53.592]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:50:53.852 --> 02:50:57.155]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:57.495 --> 02:51:07.964]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:51:08.244 --> 02:51:08.744]  That's right.
[02:51:08.924 --> 02:51:16.050]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:51:16.350 --> 02:51:24.937]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:51:33.061 --> 02:51:36.083]  You are sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[02:51:36.223 --> 02:51:41.925]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw food.
[02:51:42.106 --> 02:51:43.466]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[02:51:43.626 --> 02:51:47.668]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[02:51:47.808 --> 02:51:53.611]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[02:51:54.151 --> 02:51:56.392]  The two most complete protein superfoods known.
[02:51:56.752 --> 02:51:59.213]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water.
[02:51:59.533 --> 02:52:06.675]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you to homeostasis.
[02:52:06.975 --> 02:52:10.656]  It's also very hydrating and, more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[02:52:10.936 --> 02:52:13.497]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[02:52:13.757 --> 02:52:18.699]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.
[02:52:18.939 --> 02:52:21.600]  All right, folks, we're back live, and I guess I've got time to get a couple final calls in here.
[02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:22.140]  Who's up next, Matt?
[02:52:50.660 --> 02:52:54.363]  All right, Eric in Connecticut, up there in Skull and Bones, Nazi country.
[02:52:54.383 --> 02:52:55.183]  How are you doing today?
[02:52:55.464 --> 02:52:55.964]  Hey, Alex.
[02:52:56.024 --> 02:52:57.545]  Welcome from Neo-Connecticut.
[02:52:58.866 --> 02:53:02.208]  Where gun control is conservative and pro-family is liberal.
[02:53:02.228 --> 02:53:02.529]  Go ahead.
[02:53:02.629 --> 02:53:03.209]  Absolutely.
[02:53:03.750 --> 02:53:05.371]  I have two quick things for you, Alex.
[02:53:05.731 --> 02:53:13.877]  I have in my local paper an article about a rally that occurred November 2nd, and the title of it is Relatives Fear Public is Forgetting the Soldiers.
[02:53:13.897 --> 02:53:17.820]  Small turnout at Avcrad rally in Groton discourages families.
[02:53:18.442 --> 02:53:19.163]  We're good to go.
[02:53:19.463 --> 02:53:20.243]  We're good to go.
[02:53:32.941 --> 02:53:41.588]  Yeah, you called me a few weeks ago about the head admiral of the Navy saying we're going to merge with Russia and have a global naval force, and that was a good article you sent me.
[02:53:41.628 --> 02:53:45.911]  I did post it out of your Connecticut paper there, and yeah, that is interesting.
[02:53:46.171 --> 02:53:47.552]  Thank you for posting that, by the way.
[02:53:47.632 --> 02:53:51.976]  And also, I mentioned a while ago the Ashcroft Hannity interview.
[02:53:52.456 --> 02:54:01.203]  I was going to snail mail you the tape, but the quality of the tape was pretty crummy, so what I did was I transcribed it for you, and I'd be happy to send that to you as a document.
[02:54:01.781 --> 02:54:04.323]  Sure, do that to tips at infowars.com.
[02:54:04.363 --> 02:54:05.264]  I've got another email.
[02:54:05.804 --> 02:54:10.347]  Folks had the tape of the children in the school in the handcuffs in the drug raid.
[02:54:10.707 --> 02:54:13.109]  If somebody would send me that tape, that would be very helpful as well.
[02:54:13.730 --> 02:54:20.995]  Maybe you could put that up on your website, that interview with Ashcroft and Hannity, and it will be titled Hannity-Ashcroft Interview.
[02:54:21.275 --> 02:54:22.296]  And one last thing, Alex.
[02:54:22.776 --> 02:54:27.159]  I ordered Bloodlines of the Illuminati, and the book reads like a novel.
[02:54:27.700 --> 02:54:30.742]  There is proof being stranger than fiction.
[02:54:31.630 --> 02:54:40.414]  I think anybody who reads that book, I mean, I'm only into like the first quarter of it, but anybody who reads this book, their entire perspective on history will change.
[02:54:41.474 --> 02:54:42.174]  Well, I know this.
[02:54:42.234 --> 02:54:43.375]  I've studied a lot of history.
[02:54:43.535 --> 02:54:45.576]  I can find nothing that's inaccurate in that book.
[02:54:45.616 --> 02:54:47.957]  There's a lot of areas in it I can't prove because I haven't.
[02:54:48.616 --> 02:54:50.477]  I've heard lives were sacrificed to get that information.
[02:54:50.957 --> 02:54:51.377]  Basically, yeah.
[02:54:51.477 --> 02:54:55.359]  And from the way the government acted about this book, we know that much of it's true.
[02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:20.483]  You don't need to talk about chupacabras, Alex, because we've got the biggest chupacabra and yeti in the world, the New World Order.
[02:55:20.983 --> 02:55:21.523]  Thank you, sir.
[02:55:21.603 --> 02:55:22.104]  God bless you.
[02:55:22.204 --> 02:55:23.004]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[02:55:23.024 --> 02:55:24.305]  Yeah, truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:55:24.325 --> 02:55:31.688]  We don't talk about flying saucers and werewolves and chupacabras and snowmen, yetis, bigfoots.
[02:55:31.869 --> 02:55:33.990]  We talk about real issues here on this show.
[02:55:34.990 --> 02:55:36.091]  We'll continue to do that.
[02:55:36.211 --> 02:55:37.171]  I'm sorry I'm out of time.
[02:55:37.211 --> 02:55:38.352]  No time to take any other calls.
[02:55:38.372 --> 02:55:40.513]  We did cover a ton of the news today.
[02:55:40.533 --> 02:55:41.874]  We did get to about 80% of it.
[02:55:43.203 --> 02:55:43.803]  I think we're good to go.
[02:56:13.380 --> 02:56:21.345]  Our government's meant to go out and bulldoze the fruit trees and dispossess the peasants.
[02:56:21.385 --> 02:56:29.051]  That's meant to create hatred so then the UN can come in and be the savior, and they're now talking about that happening, as I said they do before the war even started.
[02:56:30.772 --> 02:56:32.213]  Just a horrible death toll now.
[02:56:32.433 --> 02:56:33.874]  It looks like it's going to be 32.
[02:56:33.994 --> 02:56:36.916]  One guy's hanging on by a thread, but 31 dead from the bombing yesterday.
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:38.881]  I'm out of time.
[02:56:38.921 --> 02:56:41.483]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:56:41.523 --> 02:56:45.746]  During the day, I'm on Global Shortwave 11 to 2 Central at 12.172 and 93.20 at night, 9 to midnight at 5.085 or 68.90.
[02:56:45.806 --> 02:56:48.288]  The internet at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or GCNLive.com.
[02:56:48.308 --> 02:56:48.729]  Take your pick.
[02:56:58.249 --> 02:57:07.273]  And on the satellite, the growing list of wonderful AM and FM affiliates, to the sponsors, the listeners, the folks running the show, our affiliates, you're all doing a great job.
[02:57:07.354 --> 02:57:09.535]  Keep spreading the word about all these fine broadcasts.
[02:57:09.955 --> 02:57:11.616]  Keep educating yourself about history.
[02:57:11.956 --> 02:57:13.336]  And know that we don't have a choice.
[02:57:13.416 --> 02:57:14.957]  We must stand against this tyranny.
[02:57:15.197 --> 02:57:16.578]  We're having a lot of successes.
[02:57:16.938 --> 02:57:18.079]  We haven't won this war.
[02:57:18.459 --> 02:57:19.900]  We've got to really turn the heat up.
[02:57:19.980 --> 02:57:20.420]  Take care.
[02:57:23.502 --> 02:57:25.086]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:57:25.487 --> 02:57:31.241]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:57:31.482 --> 02:57:34.149]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from...
