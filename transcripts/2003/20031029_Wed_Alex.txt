[00:00:03.143 --> 00:00:05.445]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:13.530]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.481]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:58.666]  We're already into another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:58.786 --> 00:00:59.226]  It is the 29th.
[00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:01.296]  We're good to go.
[00:01:01.316 --> 00:01:01.897]  We're good to go.
[00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:36.052]  Internal documents that Diebold was dumb enough to have on their website where they admit that their touch screens have back doors into them, wireless internet connections, where they admit that the votes can be manipulated.
[00:01:37.862 --> 00:01:41.266]  And the other voting companies have been caught involved in other activities.
[00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:45.109]  The head of Diebold is a former CIA officer at the highest levels.
[00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:50.755]  He sent a letter to the Republicans saying, I'll deliver you the votes in 2000, I'll deliver you the votes in 2002, 2004.
[00:01:50.815 --> 00:01:52.396]  There's since been secret meetings that...
[00:01:56.861 --> 00:02:10.171]  Actually, a plain dealer reporter was able to get into with the big voting company heads and industry and lobbyists, saying we've got to use our friends in the defense industry that own the media to get out ahead of this story.
[00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:12.613]  We can't let people know we're having this meeting.
[00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:14.634]  It could be called racketeering.
[00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:19.758]  Wow, my favorite word for what you guys do, the corporations controlling our government.
[00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.781]  And so now they're suing college students and universities and going after anyone that reports on the story, basically.
[00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:30.626]  So isn't that special?
[00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:31.969]  And that's just one company.
[00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.291]  Diebold was also caught in...
[00:02:34.318 --> 00:02:37.799]  The 2002 election in California manipulating votes remotely.
[00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.560]  That's been in the California papers.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.700]  But again, you'll never hear it on the nightly news.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.042]  Bev Harris, who's really been at the forefront of the electronic voting scam the last few years.
[00:02:48.122 --> 00:02:50.303]  She's a corporate corruption investigator.
[00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:53.184]  Worked on a lot of big cases.
[00:02:53.224 --> 00:02:55.084]  She got onto this about four or five years ago.
[00:02:55.604 --> 00:02:57.685]  She's got a new book out, Black Box Voting.
[00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:02.246]  And they went to the UN and had her website taken down.
[00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:03.727]  They had a takedown order on that
[00:03:04.372 --> 00:03:05.332]  I think we're good to go.
[00:03:34.497 --> 00:03:47.311]  Orlando Sentinel article, going, well, yeah, she mumbles to her parents and smiles and follows a balloon with her eyes, but that's deceptive, Michael Shivo's doctors say, and we agree.
[00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:49.113]  She's brain dead.
[00:03:49.173 --> 00:03:50.375]  She's in a coma.
[00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:55.768]  I guess like the other people they've killed in Florida who are saying, please, honey, can I have some water?
[00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:06.756]  And then Wesley Smith has written a mainstream news article that's in a bunch of big papers today exposing the lies of Larry King and Michael Schiavo and the rest of them this week.
[00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:15.122]  And so now, folks, I mean, I guess you could be pole vaulting, running the 100-yard dash at record levels, doing complex calculus.
[00:04:15.783 --> 00:04:18.445]  They're going to say, the video is deceiving.
[00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:19.786]  She's really in a coma.
[00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:32.324]  Because if you can kill this woman who smiles at her mother, her eyes are open, who has total brain activity, if you can kill her when she hunches forward, you know, tries to get up, if you can kill her, you can kill anybody.
[00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:36.647]  And they are killing people who are in a lot better shape than Terry Shivo.
[00:04:37.608 --> 00:04:40.890]  So it's just a disgusting article out of the Orlando Sentinel.
[00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.951]  I'm going to read part of it.
[00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:48.335]  When we get back, we'll get into, oh, folks, the antidepressants making the kids commit suicide.
[00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:50.537]  We knew that in 1982 when they approved it
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.404]  Prozac, just all the news is totally insane.
[00:04:55.564 --> 00:04:59.208]  Gigantic show lined up for you on this Wednesday edition.
[00:04:59.428 --> 00:05:03.051]  The websites are prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:06.995]  And the new trailer for Matrix of Evils on the website, so go watch it.
[00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:07.576]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.217 --> 00:05:14.881]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.
[00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:21.866]  You'll get 25 big packets of Ark's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds, plus four of their most popular self-reliance books.

[00:05:24.828 --> 00:05:29.972]  Imagine green beans, carrots, peas, and cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, squash, herbs, and more.
[00:05:30.173 --> 00:05:34.196]  Then, harvest your seeds to grow year after year for old-time self-reliance.
[00:05:34.496 --> 00:05:38.179]  In living well on wheat, learn how to cook, eat, and survive on the golden grain.
[00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.480]  Preserve your good food for years with the USDA Canning Guide.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.782]  In surviving a bioterrorist attack, you'll learn how to protect yourself and your family now from the attacks our government says are coming.
[00:05:47.862 --> 00:05:48.883]  Not if, but when.

[00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.389]  P.O.
[00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:08.170]  Box 1227 Jacksonville, Oregon 97530.
[00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.232]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:14.432 --> 00:06:18.834]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:18.994 --> 00:06:23.355]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:06:23.475 --> 00:06:24.736]  A New World Order.
[00:06:26.538 --> 00:06:30.762]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:30.822 --> 00:06:37.770]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.893]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:40.273 --> 00:06:50.595]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:50.875 --> 00:06:56.236]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:06:56.756 --> 00:06:59.397]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:59.517 --> 00:07:00.277]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:00.297 --> 00:07:00.757]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:05.478]  253-3139.
[00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:08.881]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:12.564]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:07:12.624 --> 00:07:16.767]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:07:17.047 --> 00:07:19.849]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:22.431]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:31.237]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:32.797]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:07:32.977 --> 00:07:39.199]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:51.401]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:07:51.582 --> 00:07:58.123]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:07:58.343 --> 00:08:01.184]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:08:01.224 --> 00:08:02.164]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:02.244 --> 00:08:03.364]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:20.238]  You want answers?
[00:08:20.998 --> 00:08:21.899]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.263]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.744 --> 00:08:30.808]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.144 --> 00:08:34.145]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:37.406]  Eight minutes and 30 seconds into the first hour.
[00:08:37.586 --> 00:08:45.530]  Bev Harris, the premier exposer of the CIA and the military, running the touchscreens.
[00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.991]  You're losing your right to vote.
[00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:48.552]  Right now, it's absolute fact.
[00:08:49.372 --> 00:08:50.973]  I just thought we'd mention that to you.
[00:08:50.993 --> 00:08:52.654]  I've been warning you about this for eight years.
[00:08:52.734 --> 00:08:53.494]  It's now here.
[00:08:54.315 --> 00:08:56.916]  Total tyranny is coming down on us from every angle.
[00:08:57.196 --> 00:08:59.157]  You may say, well, that's a negative outlook.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.406]  Well, I guess go tell the people in Southern California as a wall of flames comes towards their home and they're evacuating, tell them to sit inside their house and just have a positive attitude.
[00:09:10.107 --> 00:09:18.032]  It is positive to address the crises, to address the facts of what we're dealing with, and that's coming up in the next hour with Beverly Harris.
[00:09:18.852 --> 00:09:20.373]  And she had the U.N.
[00:09:20.553 --> 00:09:21.094]  agency...
[00:09:22.672 --> 00:09:30.195]  That regulates Internet domain names had her website taken down by the CIA front company, Diebold.
[00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:38.019]  Just because she got the documents from Diebold, where they were bragging about taking your right to vote away, basically, and how there's backdoors into their systems.
[00:09:38.929 --> 00:09:57.425]  And again, there's now been the plain dealer reporter who got in on one of the meetings because Bev told her about it, a secret meeting, a, quote, classified teleconference where they talked about racketeering, that is, industry heads and lobbyists and others and how to, quote, use their friends in the defense industry to, quote, control the media.
[00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:03.129]  Because that's who owns the big radio networks and TV networks, okay?
[00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:04.029]  It's not liberals.
[00:10:04.289 --> 00:10:05.230]  It's not conservatives.
[00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.612]  It's men with short haircuts with submachine guns under their coats.
[00:10:10.732 --> 00:10:14.254]  It's army psychiatrists with 170, 180 IQs.
[00:10:15.134 --> 00:10:24.618]  It is giant computer algorithms and psychological database studies of how to smash your brain and how to turn you into a drooling sycophant, a slave.
[00:10:24.638 --> 00:10:25.479]  Do you understand me?
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.840]  You hear me out there, yuppies?
[00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:32.842]  You understand how serious things have gotten just because you feel like you're a member of the establishment?
[00:10:33.242 --> 00:10:34.603]  You feel like you're part of this system?
[00:10:34.643 --> 00:10:35.203]  You're not.
[00:10:35.423 --> 00:10:38.844]  And you're losing everything you've got right now, and you didn't even know it.
[00:10:38.864 --> 00:10:41.985]  All right, I don't want to go into any rants today.
[00:10:42.005 --> 00:10:43.205]  I'm going to try to control myself.
[00:10:43.245 --> 00:10:47.907]  But coming up, Diebold warns on electronic voting papers.
[00:10:47.967 --> 00:10:52.388]  They say anybody that's got these papers of what they're doing to us, they're going to come after them.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.582]  Bush, clap for me or no speech.
[00:10:57.122 --> 00:11:00.885]  You know about the fake boxes that say made in the USA when they're really made in China.
[00:11:00.925 --> 00:11:05.128]  You know about making people at rallies take their ties off of the Secret Service, arrest them.
[00:11:06.508 --> 00:11:15.694]  Bush has told foreign countries, you have stage meetings with stage groups that clap for me and you sign a contract that you'll do it or I won't come speak to you.
[00:11:16.655 --> 00:11:17.636]  That's coming up.
[00:11:18.276 --> 00:11:19.377]  Sounds like freedom, doesn't it?
[00:11:20.332 --> 00:11:25.176]  It's like Ashcroft in these stage meetings, and the media goes, oh, everyone at the town hall loved him.
[00:11:25.196 --> 00:11:29.819]  Oh, we're such a free society, and up next, the running man.
[00:11:32.141 --> 00:11:40.707]  Bush warns Iraqi neighbors, and yesterday I was listening to national propaganda radio, the liberal radio, and I thought I was listening to the Warhawk channel.
[00:11:41.725 --> 00:11:48.089]  They were sitting there with all these Democrat, Republican senators going, we're going to attack Syria, we're going into Iran.
[00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:49.749]  But we're going to be reasonable.
[00:11:51.350 --> 00:12:08.139]  If Iran accepts super inspections, occupied, I'm going to say this, UN troops on the ground, helicopters, jets in the skies, ground penetrating radar scans, taking hundreds or thousands of people out of the country for interrogations, no warrants, no nothing.
[00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:11.546]  If they don't allow that now, they're going to go ahead and attack them.
[00:12:12.967 --> 00:12:15.488]  And then, basically, Israel says they're going to nuke them.
[00:12:15.588 --> 00:12:18.050]  So you're like, well, get them Iranians!
[00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:29.976]  Well, when your daughters and sons get drafted, and by the way, they've got all the drafts lined up right now for men and women, for professionals, for police, for firefighters, for engineers, for medical workers.
[00:12:30.576 --> 00:12:36.279]  Just remember, just remember, we just suddenly got to invade everybody after arming them, by the way.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.140]  So that's coming up.
[00:12:38.877 --> 00:12:41.378]  Also, officials suggest Iraq hid weapons in Syria.
[00:12:41.438 --> 00:12:43.578]  After all the lies we've heard, now we're hearing that.
[00:12:44.018 --> 00:12:44.538]  And then, see?
[00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:48.739]  Syria, after they're taken over, why, they moved the weapons to Iran.
[00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:49.739]  Well, we have to go in there.
[00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:51.940]  And, oh, they moved the weapons to Libya.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.700]  We've got to go in there.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.601]  And then they moved the weapons into your Christian church.
[00:12:56.661 --> 00:12:58.001]  So the SWAT teams have to come in.
[00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:01.902]  As you know, the right-wingers secretly worked for al-Qaeda, the news has been saying.
[00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:04.357]  This is the whole line.
[00:13:04.697 --> 00:13:12.822]  By the way, Friday there were some problems with cell phones and satellites when they said the biggest flare since 1859 hit us from the sun.
[00:13:12.842 --> 00:13:30.093]  Well, I was listening to AP Network News last night, a local station that carries my show, 1260 AM, and they were announcing that, oh, yes, today, in fact, right in the middle of this show, or by the end of it, just like last week,
[00:13:31.203 --> 00:13:36.607]  A flare 100 times bigger going 1 million miles an hour is going to hit the earth.
[00:13:37.767 --> 00:13:38.928]  100 times bigger than last week.
[00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:41.270]  Now, maybe nothing's going to happen.
[00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.491]  Sometimes things do happen.
[00:13:45.052 --> 00:13:48.914]  But it's just getting weirder and weirder and weirder and weirder.
[00:13:49.215 --> 00:13:53.097]  And I don't know if this is a cover story or something else, but...
[00:13:53.729 --> 00:13:54.369]  I think we're good to go.
[00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:55.210]  I think we're good to go.
[00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:16.634]  Which they admit in the patents and the congressional testimony that can do things like this.
[00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:17.555]  I don't know, folks.
[00:14:17.595 --> 00:14:18.576]  You just don't know anymore.
[00:14:19.096 --> 00:14:24.222]  Now they're saying there's an FBI memo about Al-Qaeda plans to set wildfires out west.
[00:14:25.305 --> 00:14:27.648]  And, yeah, I mean, that sounds like something terrorists would do.
[00:14:27.808 --> 00:14:32.715]  All these dozens of fires popping up at once, and they weren't accompanied by lightning storms.
[00:14:32.875 --> 00:14:34.117]  You know, that can do it naturally.
[00:14:34.397 --> 00:14:35.318]  Yeah, it can be terrorist.
[00:14:35.358 --> 00:14:38.142]  But I look at who has a track record of this.
[00:14:38.182 --> 00:14:39.804]  Remember Bill Clinton's last year in office?
[00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:42.588]  Dozens and dozens of fires in, what, 11 states?
[00:14:44.479 --> 00:14:44.979]  We're good to go.
[00:15:04.938 --> 00:15:06.780]  Get into that story as well.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.623]  Oil barons detention prompts KGB fears.
[00:15:10.023 --> 00:15:11.885]  They're now arresting more and more people in Iraq.
[00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:13.987]  Nearly everything that people in the U.S.
[00:15:14.067 --> 00:15:17.430]  eat will soon have to be registered with the government under Homeland Security.
[00:15:18.011 --> 00:15:26.819]  I told you two years ago I saw Governor Ridge at a, what you'd call a dress rehearsal, because they hadn't even passed Homeland Security yet.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.401]  It was a few months later.
[00:15:29.025 --> 00:15:29.666]  We're good to go.
[00:15:46.505 --> 00:15:47.066]  We're good to go.
[00:16:10.854 --> 00:16:15.956]  I mean, literally, like the KGB, the FSB, the Stasi, Fidel Castro's thugs.
[00:16:16.016 --> 00:16:18.956]  I mean, it's just 101 tyranny.
[00:16:19.017 --> 00:16:28.439]  And on Army News Watch, there's on Channel 17 in Austin, they said whether you got two employees or 100, all the Army will come every week and drug test all your employees.
[00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:29.300]  We like to help.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.020]  You know, it's a voluntary programmer.
[00:16:32.381 --> 00:16:40.443]  Or we've got articles out of the Arizona Republic from last year where, oh, the Army dropped by and vaccinated all the children who hadn't been vaccinated.
[00:16:41.684 --> 00:16:49.353]  It shows the Army there injecting a little black girl in the arm and a bunch of kids lined up behind her.
[00:16:49.413 --> 00:16:51.475]  By the way, that's in the Prison Planet audio section.
[00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:52.717]  We have hundreds of interviews we did.
[00:16:52.737 --> 00:16:55.660]  It's actually about when we started that service about a year ago.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.522]  There's a picture of a little black girl getting a shot.
[00:16:57.542 --> 00:16:59.905]  You can listen to the interview with the school officials.
[00:17:01.075 --> 00:17:01.556]  We're good to go.
[00:17:22.635 --> 00:17:23.615]  It's just my toy gun.
[00:17:23.655 --> 00:17:25.756]  And mother came out and said, please don't arrest him.
[00:17:26.056 --> 00:17:31.357]  They admit the child didn't resist, but they called it a juvenile delinquent for inciting panic.
[00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:33.538]  And mother said, please don't arrest my son.
[00:17:33.598 --> 00:17:35.178]  So they slammed her to the ground.
[00:17:35.198 --> 00:17:37.519]  They're charging her with resisting arrest.
[00:17:37.899 --> 00:17:40.019]  They just said, please don't arrest my son.
[00:17:40.239 --> 00:17:41.160]  The cops were in the article.
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.980]  Well, she talked to us, and we're charging her.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.261]  We see this all the time.
[00:17:45.301 --> 00:17:47.081]  You just talk to him, you go to jail.
[00:17:47.654 --> 00:17:49.475]  See, you're all going to get caught up in the system.
[00:17:49.515 --> 00:17:52.576]  You're all going to be good little slaves like they were in Russia.
[00:17:52.797 --> 00:17:54.177]  You're going to thank the government.
[00:17:54.357 --> 00:17:57.599]  Oh, thank you for making me a slave to keep me safe.
[00:17:58.499 --> 00:18:00.100]  Thank you for destroying America.
[00:18:01.701 --> 00:18:02.341]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:05.383]  FDA antidepressants may be linked to kids' suicide.
[00:18:05.403 --> 00:18:06.283]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:18:06.863 --> 00:18:07.944]  The interview that wasn't.
[00:18:07.984 --> 00:18:10.445]  Michael Schiavo got the usual Larry King softballs.
[00:18:10.545 --> 00:18:12.326]  Here are the questions King should have asked.
[00:18:12.746 --> 00:18:14.507]  Wesley Smith for the Daily Standard.
[00:18:15.259 --> 00:18:23.906]  Wesley Smith, we had on a few weeks ago, who in his book lists hundreds of names of people, including Florida, who are begging, saying, please may I have water and food.
[00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:25.688]  They chain you down and kill you.
[00:18:26.767 --> 00:18:39.853]  And the Orlando Sentinel, it was a story in the Statesman today in Austin, of the Orlando Sentinel, where they said, well, yeah, she blinks at her mother and smiles and follows a balloon and laughs and stuff, but that's deceiving.
[00:18:40.033 --> 00:18:42.374]  Actually, that's what vegetables do.
[00:18:42.474 --> 00:18:44.435]  See, redefining now.
[00:18:45.055 --> 00:18:46.996]  That's what vegetables do.
[00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:48.957]  It is a sick, evil article.
[00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:53.219]  That really burns me up.
[00:18:53.279 --> 00:18:55.220]  That's coming up as well.
[00:18:56.141 --> 00:18:58.723]  And, of course, nine-year-old arrested for waving toy gun.
[00:18:58.743 --> 00:18:59.643]  I wanted to tell you about that.
[00:18:59.683 --> 00:19:00.324]  Another article.
[00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:02.345]  That's out of the Morning Journal.
[00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:04.226]  Here's another one out of the Buffalo News.
[00:19:04.326 --> 00:19:06.588]  Village bans paintball and BB and pellet guns.
[00:19:06.628 --> 00:19:06.968]  Period.
[00:19:07.248 --> 00:19:07.808]  Can't have them.
[00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:11.751]  See, they can't totally ban the guns in upstate New York.
[00:19:12.411 --> 00:19:15.153]  So now they're just going to say toy guns.
[00:19:15.213 --> 00:19:16.734]  In fact, most of New York's banned toy guns.
[00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:18.982]  People are being arrested.
[00:19:19.102 --> 00:19:24.687]  There's articles with six-year-olds being criminally charged for having purple or green water guns.
[00:19:26.388 --> 00:19:28.029]  I talk to parents all the time in Austin.
[00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:37.437]  If your child says the word gun, or even if you make the image of a gun, picking your teeth, young girls are being grabbed and taken to the principal's office.
[00:19:38.017 --> 00:19:39.459]  It's all just thought crime.
[00:19:39.499 --> 00:19:45.864]  See, learning how to be a thought criminal, learning how to be a pathetic scumball jellyfish.
[00:19:47.408 --> 00:19:55.477]  Oh, yeah, so the children are thumb scanning at their school lunches, being frisked, wearing ID cards, cameras in the bathrooms and the showers all over the streets.
[00:19:55.497 --> 00:19:57.960]  They're giving them little tattletale cards.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.662]  What do mommy and daddy have in the cupboard?
[00:19:59.682 --> 00:20:01.684]  What type of guns do your mommy and daddy own?
[00:20:01.864 --> 00:20:03.626]  This is all admitted nationwide.
[00:20:03.646 --> 00:20:05.608]  Just absolute, total evil.
[00:20:06.209 --> 00:20:07.210]  Wake up to it.
[00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.091]  We'll be back.
[00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:21.182]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:20:21.363 --> 00:20:28.925]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:20:29.165 --> 00:20:30.466]  The system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.041]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:51.002]  The water level is always visible.
[00:20:51.162 --> 00:20:57.104]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:20:57.344 --> 00:21:01.046]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:21:10.209 --> 00:21:10.990]  Oh my God!
[00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:15.976]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:16.937]  Yes, it's true.
[00:21:17.037 --> 00:21:19.720]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.885]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:21:24.005 --> 00:21:24.566]  You heard it right.
[00:21:24.726 --> 00:21:29.752]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:30.693]  You may miss out forever.
[00:21:48.271 --> 00:21:48.531]  Late summer 2003.
[00:22:14.195 --> 00:22:17.317]  Mainstream Press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[00:22:17.697 --> 00:22:20.438]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[00:22:20.898 --> 00:22:23.760]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:31.284]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range is down 7% from two years ago.
[00:22:31.784 --> 00:22:32.684]  That's recovery?
[00:22:33.305 --> 00:22:38.507]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[00:22:38.907 --> 00:22:40.468]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:43.870]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[00:22:48.573 --> 00:22:50.174]  I love the sound of real money.

[00:24:35.025 --> 00:24:45.671]  Oh, by the way, coming up here later in the hour, I'm going to air the audio of the little minute and a half intro to my new film, The Matrix of Evil.
[00:24:46.516 --> 00:24:51.537]  And it starts out with the scary music and Matrix-like lettering and images.
[00:24:52.137 --> 00:24:53.618]  So obviously you'll just hear the audio.
[00:24:53.658 --> 00:25:01.699]  But then the last half of the intro cuts in with Ron Paul talking about who runs the government and how they believe in world government.
[00:25:01.719 --> 00:25:03.380]  And I talk about the New World Order.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.141]  I've got some comments from Colonel Craig Roberts, Cynthia McKinney, and others.
[00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:07.881]  We're going to play that.
[00:25:08.701 --> 00:25:10.802]  And this film is just amazing, folks.
[00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:12.582]  There's so much hardcore info in it.
[00:25:13.562 --> 00:25:17.224]  Let me go back into the news, then we'll open the phones up in the next segment.
[00:25:17.924 --> 00:25:20.045]  On this Wednesday, the 29th of October, 2003 edition, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:20.165 --> 00:25:20.565]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:20.625 --> 00:25:26.568]  You're welcome to comment on any of the news articles I just mentioned in the last segment or any news items that I've missed.
[00:25:37.347 --> 00:25:43.130]  Any piece of propaganda you'd like to expose, you have any questions, again, you know the toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:58.898]  For our audience that's online, I would advise you to go to Infowars.com and to stream the trailer for the new film, Matrix of Evil, because it really is impressive.
[00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:01.800]  In fact, go watch it and give me a call and tell me what you think of it.
[00:26:03.268 --> 00:26:07.892]  They're at Infowars.com, and I think Paul is also posted at Prison Planet.
[00:26:09.493 --> 00:26:09.814]  Okay.
[00:26:11.115 --> 00:26:15.779]  I'm going to hold off on the electronic voting machine fraud news until Bev Harris is on with us in the next hour.
[00:26:16.199 --> 00:26:17.260]  That's our top story.
[00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:21.924]  Bush, clap me or no EU speech.
[00:26:23.886 --> 00:26:25.107]  This is out of the London Mirror.
[00:26:25.896 --> 00:26:35.239]  George Bush pulled out of a speech in the European Parliament when MEPs, members of the European Parliament, wouldn't guarantee a standing ovation.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:43.062]  Senior White House officials said the President would only go to Strasbourg to talk about Iraq if he had a stage-managed welcome.
[00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:51.725]  A source close to negotiations said that last night, President Bush agreed to a speech but insisted he got a standing ovation like the State of the Union address.
[00:26:52.265 --> 00:26:55.386]  His people also insisted that there was no protest or heckling.
[00:26:56.112 --> 00:27:01.114]  And, of course, when Bush goes into Eastern Europe or into Asia or into Africa, this has been admitted, folks.
[00:27:01.154 --> 00:27:02.914]  I have the international newscast video.
[00:27:03.435 --> 00:27:16.699]  Delta Force, FBI Secret Service, with the security forces of the countries, swarm and arrest thousands, beating them up, you name it, homeless people, folks off the streets, and they put them in sports stadiums.
[00:27:16.779 --> 00:27:23.822]  So, I mean, when the emperor comes to town, when the dark lord of the Sith arrives, you've got to bow down.
[00:27:25.299 --> 00:27:34.009]  I believe it would be a crucial speech for Mr. Bush to make in light of the opposition here to the war, but unless he only gets an adulation and praise, then it will never happen.
[00:27:34.049 --> 00:27:36.372]  Mr. Bush's every appearance in the U.S.
[00:27:36.392 --> 00:27:40.136]  stage manage with audiences full of supporters, so it's more than that.
[00:27:41.133 --> 00:27:43.935]  Again, they say take your ties off or you'll be arrested or kicked out.
[00:27:44.576 --> 00:27:46.597]  They have fake Made in America boxes.
[00:27:47.378 --> 00:27:50.360]  They bring in people from defense contractor companies.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.723]  And then the news says a town hall meeting loved Bush.
[00:27:54.863 --> 00:27:56.384]  Folks, that's not freedom!
[00:27:56.404 --> 00:28:04.450]  Remember when Bill Clinton would have protesters 500 yards from his hotel arrested who had
[00:28:05.109 --> 00:28:06.070]  Bush's people do this every day!
[00:28:24.657 --> 00:28:26.318]  And it's bad when Bill Clinton does it.
[00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:28.300]  It's bad when George Bush does it.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.002]  Yes, we're not neocons on this show.
[00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:39.048]  We actually are credible and have the same litmus test, unlike the neocons who love Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:28:39.889 --> 00:28:47.275]  Hardcore gay porno mags, abortion, gun control, open borders, groping women, and involving the energy scam.
[00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:49.777]  He's your anti-scam crusader.
[00:28:50.077 --> 00:28:53.560]  Again, it's like hiring a weasel to guard the fox in the hen house.
[00:28:54.904 --> 00:28:56.966]  Bush warns Iraq neighbors U.S.
[00:28:57.006 --> 00:29:05.372]  President George W. Bush has warned Iran and Syria not to let terrorists cross into Iraq from their territory.
[00:29:06.913 --> 00:29:14.799]  We are working closely with those countries to let them know we expect them to enforce borders, Mr. Bush told journalists at the White House.
[00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:20.263]  That means if they plant some passports on somebody when they blow something up, they can attack Syria.
[00:29:20.283 --> 00:29:22.024]  See, they're setting up all the precepts here.
[00:29:22.871 --> 00:29:32.837]  And, again, I heard about ten minutes of clips from the Senate hearings yesterday on NPR, National Propaganda Fascist Radio, calling itself left-wing.
[00:29:33.897 --> 00:29:36.239]  Again, clones of Bush.
[00:29:36.759 --> 00:29:38.220]  War, war, war, war.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.421]  National draft is good.
[00:29:39.461 --> 00:29:40.541]  War, war, war.
[00:29:41.122 --> 00:29:43.843]  Iran better let us occupy them with troops or we're going to attack them.
[00:29:43.903 --> 00:29:44.784]  Isn't that reasonable?
[00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:48.586]  We'll come back and get into Prozac.
[00:29:50.174 --> 00:29:57.539]  Causing the suicides, just a ton of other global news, kids with toy guns being arrested, and your calls.
[00:29:57.579 --> 00:29:57.999]  Stay with us.
[00:30:00.421 --> 00:30:01.322]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.822 --> 00:30:03.403]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.344 --> 00:30:07.046]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.242 --> 00:30:10.723]  We're good to go.
[00:30:30.422 --> 00:30:35.243]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[00:30:35.724 --> 00:30:40.405]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises for one of the most affordable ozone generators available today.
[00:30:40.825 --> 00:30:42.245]  That number is 800-569-4340.
[00:30:44.046 --> 00:30:53.148]  The ozone generator is portable, has an internal blower for ozone disbursement into the air, and comes with a tube attachment for ozonating liquids.
[00:30:53.528 --> 00:30:54.909]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:56.589]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.
[00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:08.509]  So call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your personal ozone generator or visit on the web at CliffScott.com.
[00:31:09.969 --> 00:31:12.291]  Hi, my name is Donald from thegoldenanswer.com.
[00:31:12.612 --> 00:31:14.754]  Everyone knows that they need to own gold and silver.
[00:31:14.974 --> 00:31:16.295]  You see the headlines every day.
[00:31:16.555 --> 00:31:18.958]  It's the only safe haven in these turbulent times.
[00:31:19.278 --> 00:31:21.801]  Many of you want to acquire gold, but you can't afford it.
[00:31:21.981 --> 00:31:27.166]  Thegoldenanswer.com is a private club, and our members acquire gold at 40 cents on the dollar.
[00:31:27.346 --> 00:31:29.308]  That's right, just 40 cents on the dollar.
[00:31:29.608 --> 00:31:30.309]  We are the answer.
[00:31:51.841 --> 00:31:55.004]  For more information, visit us at thegoldenanswer.com or give us a call at 1-800-710-1090.
[00:31:55.084 --> 00:31:55.365]  That's 1-800-710-1090.
[00:32:08.743 --> 00:32:10.705]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:32:10.785 --> 00:32:11.445]  Hello, folks.
[00:32:11.565 --> 00:32:21.493]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:32:21.893 --> 00:32:26.397]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:37.806]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste, and odors are separated from the water.
[00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:38.866]  We're good to go.
[00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:16.895]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:20.198]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:23.561 --> 00:33:24.783]  All right, my friends.
[00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:31.930]  Already into the bottom of the hour segment.
[00:33:32.463 --> 00:33:44.486]  We've got Bev Harris on electronic voting scams and how they're trying to suppress this information from coming out into the consciousness of the public in the next hour.
[00:33:45.066 --> 00:33:47.087]  We've got some of your calls coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:33:47.107 --> 00:33:49.327]  The toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:49.567 --> 00:34:01.410]  We've got a bunch of global news of high importance, more on the fires, more on the super mega flare, 100 times bigger than the record flare of last Friday.
[00:34:02.162 --> 00:34:03.443]  Wow, that's interesting.
[00:34:03.523 --> 00:34:06.344]  It's going to be slamming into the earth any time now.
[00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:12.006]  It's traveling at over a million miles an hour from the surface of the sun.
[00:34:13.547 --> 00:34:20.370]  But before we go to your calls and more of the news, again, I should have burned this on CD and brought this up to the studio.
[00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:24.832]  So this is a real media file off the Internet, so the audio quality isn't really up to snuff.
[00:34:25.332 --> 00:34:29.694]  But you can go to Infowars.com and watch the trailer.
[00:34:30.709 --> 00:34:35.036]  For my new video, and that is The Matrix of Evil.
[00:34:36.748 --> 00:34:55.503]  I guess it's about a two-minute trailer, but here's about a minute of it where the audio clips come in, basically the teasers of what Colonel Craig Roberts and Ron Paul and myself and Congressman Ron Paul and Cynthia McKinney talk about in the film.
[00:34:55.663 --> 00:35:04.089]  And it is a riveting video, but here is about half of the new trailer, which is the intro to The Matrix of Evil.
[00:35:04.129 --> 00:35:05.150]  So go ahead and hit that, Mark.
[00:35:07.259 --> 00:35:13.889]  Here is the public plan, hive mind, connecting us all in by law, with microchips in our brains by 2025.
[00:35:13.949 --> 00:35:17.834]  We're looking at the literal realization of a military police state in America.
[00:35:18.054 --> 00:35:23.162]  The American people have failed in their oversight of the integrity of our political system.
[00:35:24.571 --> 00:35:29.253]  The prisons, police in black ski masks, a Nazi Germany-like nightmare.
[00:35:29.273 --> 00:35:31.575]  The final target is the American people.
[00:35:32.075 --> 00:35:35.396]  We need to break that connection between the police and the military.
[00:35:35.637 --> 00:35:38.438]  They're charging for weapons of mass destruction because they have marijuana.
[00:35:38.718 --> 00:35:42.100]  I support the Constitution, which would be at odds with my own party.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.141]  There really is an Illuminati.
[00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:45.942]  There really are 13 families.
[00:35:46.442 --> 00:35:48.583]  They own the big banks and print the money.
[00:35:49.223 --> 00:35:52.185]  They're in our universities and they're in our Congresses.
[00:35:52.585 --> 00:35:54.566]  And they believe in one world government.
[00:35:55.146 --> 00:36:01.429]  And plunge the American people into the deepest economic abyss of a generation.
[00:36:01.949 --> 00:36:08.532]  If we have or when we have another attack, it looks like they'll come with more legislation.
[00:36:09.753 --> 00:36:10.033]  Again,
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:28.124]  And again, that doesn't do it justice, but I appreciate Mark downloading that off the internet.
[00:36:29.644 --> 00:36:36.105]  I'm going to burn it on CD and play it here in higher quality for you out of my studio here in Austin, Tejas.
[00:36:36.965 --> 00:36:39.846]  But before we go to Ron and others that are holding...
[00:36:40.979 --> 00:36:47.864]  Let me just get into... Well, let's go ahead and go to calls, and then I'll get into... Officials suggest Iran had weapons in Syria.
[00:36:48.704 --> 00:36:53.147]  A new solar flare detected 100 times bigger than the record one last Friday.
[00:36:53.828 --> 00:36:57.771]  Oil baron detention prompts KGB fears of new roundup plans.
[00:36:58.211 --> 00:36:59.852]  Nearly everything that people in the U.S.
[00:36:59.972 --> 00:37:03.935]  eat will soon have to be registered with the government under anti-terrorism laws.
[00:37:04.716 --> 00:37:05.936]  We told you about this last year.
[00:37:05.976 --> 00:37:07.157]  Here it is in the Associated Press.
[00:37:07.717 --> 00:37:10.937]  FDA antidepressants may be linked to kids' suicide.
[00:37:10.957 --> 00:37:15.238]  Yeah, and shooting yourself in the head may be linked to death.
[00:37:16.259 --> 00:37:20.360]  Also, we'll get into the latest developments on Terry Schiavo, and they are disgusting.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.180]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:37:27.728 --> 00:37:32.592]  On any of these issues or any topics you'd like to raise, we have zero censorship here, folks.
[00:37:33.232 --> 00:37:35.294]  Ron in New York, you're on the air.
[00:37:35.354 --> 00:37:35.774]  Go ahead.
[00:37:36.154 --> 00:37:36.555]  Hi, Alex.
[00:37:36.575 --> 00:37:40.818]  I'd like to bring a story to your attention today, page two of the New York Daily News.
[00:37:41.438 --> 00:37:42.379]  Small little caption.
[00:37:42.399 --> 00:37:50.645]  A fellow in New Haven, Connecticut, is pounced on by the Secret Service because he looks at George Bush's daughter while she's walking down the street.
[00:37:51.389 --> 00:37:58.295]  And now they're calling him a stalker for looking at her, and it turns out he had a concealed carry permit.
[00:37:58.375 --> 00:37:59.375]  Well, understand something.
[00:37:59.656 --> 00:38:05.480]  As far as the gun part of it, at the time that they pounced on this guy for merely looking at her, they weren't even aware of that.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:14.527]  They found out subsequent to seizing him, and it turns out he had a license for the gun that they found out subsequently after they pounced on him for merely looking at her.
[00:38:14.547 --> 00:38:16.269]  Well, why wouldn't you look at a celebrity?
[00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:17.990]  I mean, I was in the city grilled.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:20.540]  We're good to go.
[00:38:44.449 --> 00:38:50.371]  With two people I can only describe as devil worshippers with satanic tattoos all over them.
[00:38:50.391 --> 00:38:53.433]  They were rude to the waitress.
[00:38:53.453 --> 00:38:55.293]  They were stumbling around.
[00:38:55.374 --> 00:38:56.754]  And this was when they were still underage.
[00:38:56.774 --> 00:38:57.714]  This was three years ago.
[00:38:57.754 --> 00:38:58.155]  Go ahead.
[00:38:58.895 --> 00:39:11.220]  Well, naturally, it goes without saying that people have a tendency to look at anyone who's a celebrity or a public figure, needless to say a member of the First Families in that category, just like a movie star or a sports figure.
[00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.552]  It has now gotten to the point that we can't look upon the beneficence of these people.
[00:39:16.572 --> 00:39:18.612]  We have to kowtow as they walk down the street.
[00:39:18.632 --> 00:39:23.454]  Remember, staffers were told, do not look at Hillary in the face or the eyes.
[00:39:23.474 --> 00:39:26.255]  This is a feudalistic idea.
[00:39:26.555 --> 00:39:30.716]  This idea is contrary to everything this country in the 21st century is about.
[00:39:30.776 --> 00:39:36.138]  As a matter of fact, that idea is contrary to everything that the Western world in the 21st century is about.
[00:39:36.158 --> 00:39:39.199]  Well, Ron, you've called before your retired police officer in New York.
[00:39:39.879 --> 00:39:40.760]  I know you well.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.282]  And what about where they admit that this nine-year-old had a toy gun.
[00:39:45.682 --> 00:39:47.463]  The cops come up, put a gun to his head.
[00:39:48.003 --> 00:39:49.183]  They know it's a toy gun.
[00:39:49.644 --> 00:39:56.527]  They arrest him for, what do they say, juvenile delinquency creating panic.
[00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:58.888]  The mother pleads, please don't arrest him.
[00:39:59.148 --> 00:40:01.409]  They arrest her for resisting arrest.
[00:40:01.969 --> 00:40:02.670]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:03.510]  This has all gotten out of hand.
[00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:04.711]  Let me tell you something.
[00:40:04.811 --> 00:40:07.152]  These things are being done outside the scope.
[00:40:07.732 --> 00:40:08.353]  Of the law.
[00:40:09.155 --> 00:40:13.942]  What their actions are and what they're doing don't even match up to what the law says word for word.
[00:40:14.343 --> 00:40:16.086]  They're creating and fabricating things.
[00:40:16.502 --> 00:40:19.785]  We're in a feudal, fascistic, autocratic state.
[00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:33.378]  In other words, authority makes up anything as it goes along now, even if it doesn't comport or parallel the letter of the actual... Yeah, it's Lord of the Flies, it's King Rat, it's Escape from New York, it's Road Warrior Time.
[00:40:33.398 --> 00:40:34.499]  No, you know what it is?
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.963]  It's 19th century Russia, and we have the Tsar, Tsar Bush.
[00:40:38.601 --> 00:40:43.404]  This is where he would probably feel he, his family, and the minions that are around him would feel more comfortable.
[00:40:43.824 --> 00:40:48.747]  In 19th century Russia, being a czar, instead of 21st century America, being a president.
[00:40:49.048 --> 00:40:56.092]  Hey, you don't like it that Bush is going to sign the assault weapons ban and the new bill that registers all gun owners?
[00:40:56.432 --> 00:40:59.774]  I don't like that in the Patriot Act I. Well, you're a liberal then.
[00:40:59.794 --> 00:41:00.995]  He built in an exemption.
[00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:02.416]  He built in an exemption.
[00:41:02.996 --> 00:41:06.158]  Okay, for those that don't know, and since you called in last week with this...
[00:41:31.976 --> 00:41:39.402]  I've got more calls and emails, almost all your big catalogs, you name it, bank accounts, everything.
[00:41:39.462 --> 00:41:41.804]  You've got to waive your rights to the Patriot Act.
[00:41:41.864 --> 00:41:47.508]  It's all color of law, civil, to be able to buy underwear, and you say that you actually saw that and now have been sent that.
[00:41:47.548 --> 00:41:58.776]  Yes, as a matter of fact, anybody who gets the statements, the contractual statements you sign when you apply for a credit card, it'll be stated right in there, whether it's for a department store credit card or a Visa or a MasterCard or whatever.
[00:41:59.335 --> 00:42:11.532]  I mean, it's to the point that if you even ask somebody... I've actually had an inquiry with somebody from a major life insurance company about how the Patriot Act may be affecting the life insurance situation with whole life policies.
[00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:16.191]  They act like you're asking them, you know, to tell them a state secret.
[00:42:16.211 --> 00:42:19.792]  The law is considered a state secret, even though it's on the books and it's a public record.
[00:42:19.812 --> 00:42:20.533]  This is sick.
[00:42:20.993 --> 00:42:22.274]  This country's getting sick.
[00:42:22.694 --> 00:42:26.796]  This administration, I don't even want to call it administration anymore.
[00:42:26.856 --> 00:42:28.397]  That's for a republic.
[00:42:28.417 --> 00:42:29.577]  We call it an administration.
[00:42:30.098 --> 00:42:33.219]  This autocracy is out of its mind.
[00:42:33.679 --> 00:42:34.480]  It's out of its mind.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.001]  And if we love America and I'm tired, I want to say something else.
[00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:41.243]  People who think, well, because it's a republic and we've got to go along for it.
[00:42:41.703 --> 00:42:42.644]  Stop that nonsense.
[00:42:43.148 --> 00:42:44.689]  Stop that nonsense here and now.
[00:42:44.749 --> 00:42:45.529]  That's got to end now.
[00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:49.952]  Loyalty to parties should never exceed common sense and human decency.
[00:42:50.092 --> 00:42:51.353]  It's both parties.
[00:42:51.633 --> 00:42:52.233]  Yes, it's both.
[00:42:52.493 --> 00:42:58.216]  That's the dialectic that's confusing us with two false choices when it's two arms on the same creature.
[00:42:58.556 --> 00:43:04.300]  Instead of being loyal to a political party, be loyal to the higher concepts that everybody purports to believe in.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.321]  Morality, Christ, Christianity, civility.
[00:43:07.742 --> 00:43:10.323]  Be loyal to those principles.
[00:43:10.343 --> 00:43:12.044]  Well, Ron, to the police officers listening...
[00:43:12.728 --> 00:43:13.148]  Out there.
[00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:26.379]  I mean, they know that in the public schools, if a child points, and people point by their three fingers back, their thumb, it looks like a gun.
[00:43:26.519 --> 00:43:27.840]  Children are being arrested.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.482]  CPS are going after parents.
[00:43:29.942 --> 00:43:33.925]  Now, if a child points at somebody, they're calling that aggression.
[00:43:33.965 --> 00:43:35.927]  They've banned dodgeball nationwide.
[00:43:36.247 --> 00:43:37.788]  They're banning musical chairs.
[00:43:38.969 --> 00:43:40.911]  Right here in Austin, at most middle schools,
[00:43:41.522 --> 00:43:42.903]  You're not allowed to run.
[00:43:42.923 --> 00:43:44.124]  This has been in the paper.
[00:43:44.404 --> 00:43:49.028]  You're not allowed to run during recess because that is called, quote, aggressive.
[00:43:49.409 --> 00:43:50.830]  I mean, this is worse.
[00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:52.891]  This is worse.
[00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:55.053]  This is worse than 1984.
[00:43:55.173 --> 00:43:55.694]  Much worse.
[00:43:56.034 --> 00:44:09.385]  There's a story in today's New York Post, page 23, about a boy in a New Jersey school who drew a picture of an American soldier shooting what he says, well, it obviously appears to be an American soldier,
[00:44:10.228 --> 00:44:13.250]  Shooting what he says is a Taliban soldier or a Taliban fighter.
[00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:14.972]  And we all drew those pictures.
[00:44:15.032 --> 00:44:19.315]  My mother's got boxes of them that she pulls out every five years and we laugh at.
[00:44:19.455 --> 00:44:24.019]  You want to go into many art museums and see the bloody scenes, war scenes, and so forth?
[00:44:24.239 --> 00:44:25.099]  I live in New York.
[00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:32.685]  But then notice the TV, the television, when it's not teaching you how to be a homosexual, is showing you the most violent garbage imaginable.
[00:44:33.166 --> 00:44:35.307]  And so he draws a picture like this, right?
[00:44:35.648 --> 00:44:38.069]  Which is just a reflection of the world around him.
[00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:39.791]  Artists have been drawing these pictures.
[00:44:40.638 --> 00:44:46.362]  Probably since the medieval times, you could go and see great artworks of conflict and combat and violence.
[00:44:46.682 --> 00:44:59.991]  Yeah, hanging up in the House chambers of the Texas legislature is a giant, beautiful painting of the Mexicans pouring over the wall and of Davy Crockett and Travis being killed.
[00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:03.773]  And it's one of tens of thousands throughout this world and in this country.
[00:45:04.054 --> 00:45:06.935]  And this kid is suspended, I believe, for three or four days for that.
[00:45:07.376 --> 00:45:10.057]  And when they ask the school administration why they did it... That's nothing.
[00:45:10.197 --> 00:45:11.098]  Usually they arrest him.
[00:45:11.758 --> 00:45:13.459]  I'm surprised it didn't wind up that far.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:18.443]  But when they asked the school administration why they did this, they said it kind of looked Columbine-like.
[00:45:18.823 --> 00:45:23.606]  Could you imagine an ignorant, trite, bourgeois, retard statement like that?
[00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:33.995]  An MTV pop culture statement like that coming from school administration because a boy draws a picture of the war, which, by the way, he has two relatives fighting him.
[00:45:34.755 --> 00:45:37.237]  Hey, look, right here in Austin, and we've seen hundreds.
[00:45:37.297 --> 00:45:38.697]  There's an article every day in the news about it.
[00:45:38.757 --> 00:45:39.698]  I don't even read them anymore.
[00:45:40.218 --> 00:45:42.439]  Here in Austin was a young student.
[00:45:42.479 --> 00:45:43.780]  I think it was, what, sixth grade.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.641]  His father is a captain of the Marines.
[00:45:45.961 --> 00:45:49.903]  He drew a picture of his father with a machine gun, and they called police in.
[00:45:50.905 --> 00:45:51.526]  This is sick.
[00:45:51.926 --> 00:45:52.847]  This is totally sick.
[00:45:52.867 --> 00:45:56.549]  The country is becoming charged with neurotic paranoia like the Third Reich under Hitler.
[00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:57.890]  It's total mind... Look!
[00:45:58.411 --> 00:46:00.372]  You can't say the word gun!
[00:46:01.653 --> 00:46:03.815]  They're now... It's mind control.
[00:46:03.895 --> 00:46:04.516]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:05.857 --> 00:46:06.637]  It is, folks.
[00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:10.940]  And the border's wide open, and every terrorist group we investigate is funded by the CIA.
[00:46:12.201 --> 00:46:13.643]  Steve in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:46:13.663 --> 00:46:14.123]  Go ahead.
[00:46:14.143 --> 00:46:15.544]  Hello, Alex.
[00:46:15.684 --> 00:46:16.825]  This is Steve.
[00:46:17.025 --> 00:46:18.546]  Let me get on the regular there.
[00:46:18.566 --> 00:46:20.248]  The guy wanted me on the regular phone.
[00:46:20.268 --> 00:46:20.568]  You there?
[00:46:20.962 --> 00:46:21.662]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:46:21.762 --> 00:46:25.744]  Okay, yeah, they're blanketing us like crazy with chemtrails in Ohio.
[00:46:25.804 --> 00:46:29.426]  I just want to let you know, and the reception is terrible.
[00:46:29.506 --> 00:46:31.667]  It's not even like the stations aren't even there.
[00:46:32.147 --> 00:46:40.691]  Well, we're getting calls from AM and FM stations that either are going further or aren't going out.
[00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:46.173]  That's because a flare 100 times the record flare of last Friday is now hitting us.
[00:46:46.753 --> 00:46:47.173]  Wow.
[00:46:48.294 --> 00:46:48.574]  Whoa.
[00:46:49.867 --> 00:46:53.850]  Well, hey, I'd be great for what you do.
[00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:55.471]  I pray for you all the time.
[00:46:55.491 --> 00:47:00.634]  And hang in there, buddy, and everybody else.
[00:47:01.555 --> 00:47:04.817]  Yeah, they're just blanketing us all.
[00:47:04.897 --> 00:47:07.799]  Well, Steve, what do you think about the news items we've thrown out here?
[00:47:07.819 --> 00:47:08.520]  You got any comments?
[00:47:10.181 --> 00:47:15.584]  Yeah, I just think you're a bunch of phony, well...
[00:47:17.003 --> 00:47:21.467]  You know, what I got to say is just about basically what you got to say.
[00:47:21.548 --> 00:47:22.749]  We are in agreement.
[00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:28.654]  And I know you'd rather have somebody call you that disagrees, but sorry.
[00:47:29.896 --> 00:47:30.636]  I hear you, Steve.
[00:47:30.656 --> 00:47:31.277]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:31.337 --> 00:47:31.998]  I appreciate it.
[00:47:32.438 --> 00:47:33.699]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:47:33.739 --> 00:47:36.282]  We'll go to some more of the patient callers here in a second.
[00:47:39.744 --> 00:47:46.248]  Yeah, I would like people to disagree with me because I like to understand the mindset.
[00:47:46.268 --> 00:47:47.129]  But let me tell you something.
[00:47:47.989 --> 00:47:50.711]  And I say this every few weeks because it's so important.
[00:47:51.792 --> 00:47:54.174]  And it just gets better and better, the feedback I'm getting.
[00:47:54.894 --> 00:47:57.256]  I mean, I did four radio interviews yesterday.
[00:47:57.396 --> 00:47:58.196]  No, that's not true.
[00:47:58.296 --> 00:47:58.637]  Five.
[00:48:00.498 --> 00:48:05.241]  Five radio interviews yesterday, and no one called in to disagree.
[00:48:06.116 --> 00:48:07.978]  And four of the interviews were mainstream.
[00:48:08.058 --> 00:48:09.919]  One of them was here on this network with Pastor Butch Paul.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.722]  And that's on a bunch of AM and FM stations.
[00:48:12.742 --> 00:48:20.728]  I mean, I sit here on this show on dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of AM and FM stations.
[00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:23.731]  Shortwave, one of the biggest internet listening audiences out there.
[00:48:23.771 --> 00:48:24.612]  Go look at Shoutcast.
[00:48:24.872 --> 00:48:27.374]  We're routinely rated number one, folks, against Dr. Laura.
[00:48:28.832 --> 00:48:34.914]  And I sit here on the air, no one's screening calls, just what's your name, where you calling from, and no one calls in to disagree.
[00:48:34.934 --> 00:48:38.375]  I do four mainstream interviews, no one calls in to disagree.
[00:48:39.035 --> 00:48:57.900]  I'll go on some 50,000 water for two hours, they'll take 20, 30 calls, maybe one person will call in, they're incoherent, and they say, I want to kill you, or I hope they put you in a camp, or you're a liberal, or you're a right-winger, you know, they're a liberal, I'm a right-winger, they're a phony conservative, I'm a liberal.
[00:48:59.578 --> 00:49:02.099]  And, you know, well, gun control is conservative.
[00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:03.559]  We've got to pass some gun laws.
[00:49:03.639 --> 00:49:04.959]  So what if Bush does that?
[00:49:04.999 --> 00:49:06.060]  We've got to compromise.
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.741]  I mean, look, I've done my own poll all over this country.
[00:49:10.741 --> 00:49:12.321]  And all I see is people waking up.
[00:49:13.902 --> 00:49:15.002]  That's all I see, folks.
[00:49:15.642 --> 00:49:17.583]  But, again, they'll tell you, well, we don't have any power.
[00:49:17.603 --> 00:49:18.763]  No one can affect change.
[00:49:18.803 --> 00:49:21.003]  We can't get anything done.
[00:49:21.084 --> 00:49:21.864]  Nobody cares.
[00:49:22.384 --> 00:49:24.864]  I'll be at the grocery store surrounded by 15, 20 people.
[00:49:24.924 --> 00:49:25.865]  I'll stop and start talking.
[00:49:25.905 --> 00:49:26.825]  A crowd will gather.
[00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:29.245]  And they're all, you're right, you're right.
[00:49:29.325 --> 00:49:29.846]  I saw this.
[00:49:29.906 --> 00:49:30.306]  I saw this.
[00:49:30.326 --> 00:49:31.106]  This happened to my neighbor.
[00:49:31.126 --> 00:49:32.086]  This happened to my child.
[00:49:32.126 --> 00:49:34.167]  This is on and on and on.
[00:49:34.487 --> 00:49:38.908]  My husband's in the Army, and he says the troops hate what's happening, and they're enslaving the people.
[00:49:39.748 --> 00:49:40.668]  But there's nothing we can do.
[00:49:40.728 --> 00:49:41.369]  Nobody cares.
[00:49:41.889 --> 00:49:44.029]  And I go, every person that's walked by has stopped.
[00:49:44.289 --> 00:49:49.531]  You're all telling me that you believe in what's happening, but you're all, again, regurgitating that nobody cares.
[00:49:49.571 --> 00:49:50.631]  We can't get anything done.
[00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:54.830]  What if you guys all got together and went off and formed some group?
[00:49:55.130 --> 00:50:06.176]  You could take this city over in two years by putting out your ideas, codifying your plan, your manifesto, your constitution, going out, getting 10 other people, getting them to get 10 other people.
[00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:15.501]  But no, no, we've just got to talk about how we can't get anything done, how we can't effect change, how we don't have any power, how resistance is futile.
[00:50:16.802 --> 00:50:18.043]  It's so frustrating.
[00:50:18.083 --> 00:50:19.443]  But yeah, I sit here on the air.
[00:50:19.484 --> 00:50:20.224]  I'll do it right now.
[00:50:21.078 --> 00:50:25.140]  I'm told we have some lines open, which doesn't happen a lot lately.
[00:50:25.161 --> 00:50:30.864]  1-800-259-9231 Tell me why I'm wrong.
[00:50:30.924 --> 00:50:31.845]  I mean, I know you're listening.
[00:50:31.865 --> 00:50:33.145]  I get your occasional emails.
[00:50:33.846 --> 00:50:34.806]  Tell me why I'm wrong.
[00:50:34.866 --> 00:50:36.327]  Tell me why world government's good.
[00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:39.829]  Or tell me why George Bush is good.
[00:50:39.869 --> 00:50:42.551]  Or, you know, how gun control's conservative.
[00:50:42.591 --> 00:50:42.991]  Whatever.
[00:50:44.252 --> 00:50:44.672]  Tell me.
[00:50:44.752 --> 00:50:45.613]  Explain it to me.
[00:50:46.113 --> 00:50:46.974]  I know you're out there.
[00:50:46.994 --> 00:50:48.955]  I mean, there are certainly people out there who disagree with this show.
[00:50:49.415 --> 00:50:50.756]  But they don't know how to dial a telephone.
[00:50:52.077 --> 00:50:58.420]  I'll be on shows where I'm being attacked by the host, and people don't call in to disagree.
[00:50:59.721 --> 00:51:00.622]  I mean, where are you?
[00:51:01.602 --> 00:51:02.183]  Where are you?
[00:51:02.703 --> 00:51:04.344]  We'll come back with more news and more calls.
[00:51:04.424 --> 00:51:05.284]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:05.324 --> 00:51:08.486]  Go to Infowars.com to watch the Matrix clip.
[00:51:09.781 --> 00:51:10.221]  Check out 1-2-3nodebt.com.
[00:51:33.354 --> 00:51:33.835]  We're good to go.
[00:51:53.251 --> 00:52:02.896]  1-2-3-NoDebt.com Come over and get our rock-solid technology that wipes out debt without bankruptcy.

[00:52:09.918 --> 00:52:13.821]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:14.041 --> 00:52:19.485]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:19.765 --> 00:52:30.112]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:30.292 --> 00:52:34.635]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:34.815 --> 00:52:43.197]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:43.437 --> 00:52:49.819]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:52:49.919 --> 00:52:54.400]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:58.841]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:52:59.101 --> 00:53:03.502]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-

[00:53:04.422 --> 00:53:06.525]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:53:13.889 --> 00:53:15.170]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:21.134]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:53:21.394 --> 00:53:26.657]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:53:26.957 --> 00:53:31.100]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:35.082]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:53:35.322 --> 00:53:39.965]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:53:40.045 --> 00:53:42.767]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:53:43.107 --> 00:53:46.288]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:53:46.328 --> 00:53:48.208]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:53:48.648 --> 00:53:50.729]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:55.089]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:53:55.169 --> 00:53:56.470]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:53:56.690 --> 00:54:02.331]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:54:02.451 --> 00:54:04.451]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:54:04.691 --> 00:54:06.192]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:54:06.372 --> 00:54:08.412]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:18.643]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:19.243 --> 00:54:22.284]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:25.225 --> 00:54:28.887]  Well, we loaded the phones up there, and no one disagrees.
[00:54:29.707 --> 00:54:33.309]  So, again, just keep trying to get in if you exist out there.
[00:54:33.329 --> 00:54:36.510]  By the way, I got this email last week.
[00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:41.452]  I'm reporting you to the police all over Colorado.
[00:54:42.208 --> 00:54:48.810]  People are spraypainting Infowars.com on government signage, and I know you're doing it.
[00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:53.411]  Yeah, I'm in Colorado in the middle of the night spraypainting Infowars.com.
[00:54:53.911 --> 00:55:09.395]  I've gotten threatening emails from all over the world, from Italy, and the other place was New Zealand, where look at this photo of somebody climbed up on this big building and spraypainted Infowars.com or presentplanet.com.
[00:55:09.415 --> 00:55:10.315]  You better stop it.
[00:55:11.229 --> 00:55:12.689]  I'm not doing that!
[00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:21.332]  Whoever is doing it, it's just terrible what you're doing, trying to warn folks about how they're taking our right to vote away and how they're building concentration camps.
[00:55:22.092 --> 00:55:25.153]  Imagine if the Jews would have tried to spray paint warnings.
[00:55:25.193 --> 00:55:26.934]  That would have been horrible in Nazi Germany.
[00:55:27.354 --> 00:55:33.736]  Well, actually, it wouldn't have been horrible, but again, we're not advocating anything illegal here on the show.
[00:55:34.821 --> 00:55:36.883]  Certainly not on private property, I'll say that.
[00:55:37.964 --> 00:55:39.625]  It's a phenomenon, let's just put it that way.
[00:55:39.945 --> 00:55:41.507]  For years, people have been doing that.
[00:55:41.927 --> 00:55:42.928]  What do you think about that?
[00:55:44.089 --> 00:55:44.509]  I don't know.
[00:55:44.529 --> 00:55:46.731]  I know a lot of folks put billboards up in their yards.
[00:55:46.771 --> 00:55:47.512]  I appreciate that.
[00:55:47.992 --> 00:55:50.895]  We're about to go to Charles and Todd and Scott and David and others.
[00:55:50.915 --> 00:55:58.141]  We've got Bev Harris coming up in about ten minutes about electronic voting fraud and the government and how they're trying to suppress the news articles.
[00:55:58.181 --> 00:55:59.402]  But before we do that,
[00:56:00.575 --> 00:56:17.218]  Go to Infowars.com, go to PrisonPlanet.com, and watch the trailer for The Matrix of Evil, my new two-plus-hour video with Ron Paul and all these other great folks, Cynthia McKinney, myself, Colonel Craig Roberts doing a great job, Frank Morales.
[00:56:18.067 --> 00:56:21.728]  I mean, Ron Paul talks about how those running Washington believe in one world government.
[00:56:22.148 --> 00:56:22.909]  I talk about it.
[00:56:23.209 --> 00:56:29.311]  World Depression, Cashless Society, Control Grid, Indeposit Comitatus, government-sponsored terror.
[00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:32.352]  It's all covered, up-to-date, latest info.
[00:56:32.952 --> 00:56:35.193]  You need to go to Infowars.com to get it.
[00:56:36.198 --> 00:56:46.308]  Or call toll-free to get the new film, or Police State 3, or the new book, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:56:46.328 --> 00:56:46.768]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:47.729 --> 00:56:51.893]  You get a great video that you're authorized to make copies of to get out to folks, and it supports this show.
[00:56:52.454 --> 00:56:53.435]  Your support is needed.
[00:56:54.343 --> 00:57:08.132]  1-888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:57:10.294 --> 00:57:14.577]  Okay, let's talk to Charles in Florida, then Todd, Scott, and others.
[00:57:15.057 --> 00:57:15.818]  Charles, go ahead.
[00:57:16.318 --> 00:57:17.199]  How you doing?
[00:57:17.239 --> 00:57:17.619]  Pretty good.
[00:57:18.159 --> 00:57:20.881]  Well, same thing's happening over and over.
[00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:23.363]  It looks like we just got to keep pushing, but...
[00:57:24.068 --> 00:57:25.069]  I got some good news.
[00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:27.651]  I went to a gunsmith.
[00:57:27.871 --> 00:57:31.614]  They had a gunsmith checking guns and cleaning guns for not trying to sell guns.
[00:57:31.654 --> 00:57:34.417]  And we met a trooper that was related to my wife.
[00:57:35.418 --> 00:57:39.421]  He was a sheriff, and he retired from that, and he'd become a state trooper.
[00:57:40.322 --> 00:57:42.243]  And he knew about the executive orders.
[00:57:42.283 --> 00:57:45.426]  I think it was 1472 about disarming the police.
[00:57:46.127 --> 00:57:50.070]  He knew about all this, and I went and had a cup of coffee with him, and I asked him, what's going on?
[00:57:50.791 --> 00:57:52.152]  He's saying that the police...
[00:57:53.052 --> 00:57:55.814]  They've gotten so corrupt, he can't wait to retire.
[00:57:55.834 --> 00:57:57.355]  That's how corrupt they got.
[00:57:58.676 --> 00:58:13.527]  Hey, 12 years ago in college, my dad's friend, one of his patients, who was the head fed over the federal marshals in Texas, told me, what are you thinking about in college?
[00:58:13.567 --> 00:58:15.048]  I was just like, oh, I'm looking at a bunch of stuff.
[00:58:15.068 --> 00:58:17.430]  Might be a teacher, might go into law enforcement.
[00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:19.231]  He goes, don't do that unless you're a criminal.
[00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:24.752]  And this is a big old six-foot-four, gray-haired guy telling me this, you know, Vietnam vet.
[00:58:25.272 --> 00:58:33.438]  He's telling me this, and every day in the paper, there's cops running the prostitutes, the drugs, everything, Charles.
[00:58:33.758 --> 00:58:36.479]  Well, Mr. Jones, just please listen to what I have to say.
[00:58:36.579 --> 00:58:39.181]  I don't call much anymore, but... No, no, I want to hear from you.
[00:58:39.221 --> 00:58:40.002]  Stay there, okay?
[00:58:40.762 --> 00:58:41.142]  Charles?
[00:58:41.703 --> 00:58:42.203]  Okay, bud?
[00:58:42.463 --> 00:58:43.184]  Yes, sir.
[00:58:43.224 --> 00:58:43.684]  Don't hang up.
[00:58:43.724 --> 00:58:45.225]  Of course I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:58:45.905 --> 00:58:46.846]  You're welcome to call.
[00:58:47.646 --> 00:58:48.247]  My goodness.
[00:58:48.962 --> 00:58:50.483]  We just love all you guys to death.
[00:58:51.304 --> 00:58:53.185]  We'd like the folks even more to disagree with us, though.
[00:58:53.646 --> 00:58:57.388]  Come back with Charles, Todd, Scott, David, and others, and Bev Harris.
[00:58:57.449 --> 00:58:57.969]  Stay with us.
[00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:07.496]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[00:59:07.756 --> 00:59:08.797]  The Berkey's LED 03443.
[00:59:08.857 --> 00:59:10.118]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:26.136]  Big Brother.
[00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:27.857]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:28.578 --> 00:59:29.619]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:31.140]  You want answers?
[00:59:31.921 --> 00:59:32.802]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:32.822 --> 00:59:37.065]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:37.666 --> 00:59:41.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:43.071 --> 00:59:43.751]  All right, folks.
[00:59:44.112 --> 00:59:46.033]  We are scheduled to have Beverly Harris up.
[00:59:46.094 --> 00:59:48.255]  If I can get in touch with my producer and get her phone number.
[00:59:49.697 --> 00:59:50.798]  Coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:56.122]  About electronic voting fraud and all the new big developments in that.
[00:59:57.602 --> 01:00:00.683]  And right now we are going back to Charles.
[01:00:01.104 --> 01:00:02.104]  Charles, go ahead.
[01:00:02.144 --> 01:00:09.267]  You said you were talking to a relation who's a state police officer, and he was talking about the plan to disarm the police.
[01:00:09.307 --> 01:00:09.727]  Go ahead.
[01:00:10.387 --> 01:00:15.949]  Well, he's saying that good police are getting away from the police department.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.421]  But these guys come today, they're just gone whole.
[01:00:19.481 --> 01:00:21.121]  He said, we're in a lot of trouble here.
[01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:24.222]  And he told me, he said, I heard about this tape.
[01:00:24.262 --> 01:00:25.802]  Have you, the guy, been giving the tapes out?
[01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:26.802]  And I said, maybe I am.
[01:00:26.842 --> 01:00:29.203]  I gave about almost 4,000 tapes out.
[01:00:30.063 --> 01:00:37.305]  He said, well, it's doing some good because, he said, about two weeks ago they had a big conversation about these tapes, these tapes from Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.385 --> 01:00:37.865]  I said, yes.
[01:00:38.445 --> 01:00:40.325]  I said, I got a tape and a call for you, too.
[01:00:40.946 --> 01:00:42.706]  So he said, well, yeah, give me it.
[01:00:44.045 --> 01:00:44.906]  I'd like to have my own.
[01:00:45.146 --> 01:00:46.386]  They had a big conversation?
[01:00:46.426 --> 01:00:46.907]  What was that?
[01:00:47.207 --> 01:00:50.308]  About how our government's turning against the people.
[01:00:51.469 --> 01:00:52.629]  How we're losing our rights.
[01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:55.210]  He said it was in the locker room.
[01:00:55.611 --> 01:00:58.452]  But it was over your tape.
[01:00:58.472 --> 01:00:59.993]  Let me just say this.
[01:01:00.053 --> 01:01:01.253]  It's Christmas time coming.
[01:01:01.293 --> 01:01:03.074]  I did this for the last three or four Christmases.
[01:01:04.175 --> 01:01:11.538]  If everybody would just buy a tape and give to their family, and if the family they give it to would make another tape or pass the tape on,
[01:01:12.251 --> 01:01:18.314]  We could wake up the public very quickly, but I feel it that the patriots are just letting other people do it.
[01:01:20.816 --> 01:01:22.437]  We have to give shortwave radios out.
[01:01:22.457 --> 01:01:24.238]  We have to do everything we can do.
[01:01:26.059 --> 01:01:27.239]  And these tapes explain it.
[01:01:27.399 --> 01:01:28.140]  I can't explain it.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.080]  I don't have the education.
[01:01:29.401 --> 01:01:33.063]  But at least I know from talking to that trooper, I am affecting people.
[01:01:34.083 --> 01:01:36.524]  I'm nobody, and I'm affecting policemen.
[01:01:36.765 --> 01:01:37.305]  I know this.
[01:01:38.157 --> 01:01:39.337]  And I thank God for it.
[01:01:39.718 --> 01:01:41.638]  I thank God that I have the ability to do this.
[01:01:42.159 --> 01:01:47.380]  But if the Patriots have to get off the can and do this, forget about the football games.
[01:01:47.641 --> 01:01:49.001]  It's time to save our country.
[01:01:49.061 --> 01:01:50.462]  We don't have much time to go.
[01:01:50.982 --> 01:01:53.603]  People think it's just going to roll on and on and on.
[01:01:53.903 --> 01:01:55.584]  We are in trouble, Mr. Jones.
[01:01:55.704 --> 01:01:56.924]  We are in serious trouble.
[01:01:57.144 --> 01:02:00.705]  Well, I agree, but let me tell you, we have hurt them badly.
[01:02:00.745 --> 01:02:02.266]  Their agenda has been exposed.
[01:02:02.766 --> 01:02:07.368]  And if you wouldn't have done what you did, I mean this, I'm talking to you and all the others that took action.
[01:02:08.147 --> 01:02:14.169]  And yes, we are, this network, and you, the listeners, take a large part of the credit.
[01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:16.871]  The globalists would have already carried out more terror.
[01:02:16.891 --> 01:02:19.151]  They were already planning to do it from all the indicators.
[01:02:19.692 --> 01:02:22.773]  And we are fighting toe-to-toe against the greatest evil in history.
[01:02:23.113 --> 01:02:25.614]  We're having victories, and all the glory goes to Christ.
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.641]  And we have just got to turn the heat up now because we're in a fight for our lives, brother.
[01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:31.362]  Oh, yes.
[01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:33.002]  We follow the Jews.
[01:02:33.142 --> 01:02:35.063]  Even this policeman said, keep up what you're doing.
[01:02:35.203 --> 01:02:36.323]  It is making a difference.
[01:02:36.944 --> 01:02:41.925]  I mean, the policeman told me that I'm an ex-convict, and he's saying, do what you keep doing what you're doing.
[01:02:42.005 --> 01:02:42.945]  It is making a difference.
[01:02:43.086 --> 01:02:45.406]  And this is a distant relation to your wife.
[01:02:45.586 --> 01:02:45.966]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:46.007 --> 01:02:52.389]  We didn't know it until we went to the gun show, Gunsmith, and we just happened to be talking.
[01:02:52.409 --> 01:02:53.509]  He's related to my wife.
[01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:55.877]  See, we're moving into a new parish.
[01:02:55.937 --> 01:02:58.841]  I'm not in Satsuma no more.
[01:02:58.901 --> 01:02:59.983]  I'm in Walker now.
[01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:02.807]  And so I'm affecting these people in Walker.
[01:03:02.827 --> 01:03:04.609]  I've got a whole new parish I'm working on.
[01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:07.814]  And I'm planning on, by Christmas time, to give out another 150 tapes.
[01:03:09.255 --> 01:03:09.716]  We're good to go.
[01:03:27.042 --> 01:03:33.365]  If we do this with news articles, give out the broadcasts, I mean, we're saving lives.
[01:03:33.425 --> 01:03:34.805]  Well, you know, it's not hype.
[01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:40.688]  And the network, I don't get a dime for this, for like $19, sells a whole month of whatever show you want.
[01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:42.709]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:47.391]  That's enough to educate somebody almost completely with a whole month of my broadcast.
[01:03:47.711 --> 01:03:47.851]  Yes.
[01:03:49.002 --> 01:03:50.523]  Well, I donate to different ones, too.
[01:03:50.583 --> 01:03:51.563]  Well, you're awesome, man.
[01:03:51.623 --> 01:03:53.404]  And, you know, I tell you, you're right.
[01:03:53.464 --> 01:03:54.264]  We do have power.
[01:03:54.304 --> 01:03:55.324]  We are affecting change.
[01:03:55.404 --> 01:03:58.525]  And which of my videos have you found is waking the most of the folks up?
[01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:03.807]  Well, for the Christians, I like Bohemian Grove's Dog Seekers.
[01:04:03.887 --> 01:04:06.548]  That's for the Christians.
[01:04:06.768 --> 01:04:08.969]  And I still like 9-1-1 Road to Charity.
[01:04:09.609 --> 01:04:10.689]  Well, thank you, Charles.
[01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:12.490]  More calls of Bev Harris coming up.
[01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:15.371]  I'm Alex Jones, and I'm telling you, we're on the march.
[01:04:15.411 --> 01:04:16.391]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:17.852]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:20.856 --> 01:04:22.657]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[01:04:22.857 --> 01:04:25.718]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[01:04:25.959 --> 01:04:27.779]  Call Term Busters now.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.480]  Rates are low right now.
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:30.781]  Call and compare.
[01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:41.526]  For example, a man age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1 million of coverage is only $75 a month level for the next 10 years.
[01:04:41.806 --> 01:04:43.487]  Call Term Busters now.
[01:04:43.527 --> 01:04:44.047]  We're good to go.
[01:05:03.683 --> 01:05:08.388]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:25.405 --> 01:05:29.849]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:29.989 --> 01:05:34.373]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:05:34.413 --> 01:05:37.275]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:05:37.535 --> 01:05:41.759]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:41.819 --> 01:05:48.765]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:48.885 --> 01:05:50.887]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:51.287 --> 01:06:01.616]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:01.876 --> 01:06:07.260]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:06:07.761 --> 01:06:10.403]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:06:10.523 --> 01:06:11.684]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:11.704 --> 01:06:12.144]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:12.165 --> 01:06:13.946]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:20.271 --> 01:06:23.753]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:27.516]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:31.558]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:06:31.778 --> 01:06:37.942]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:46.267]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:06:46.667 --> 01:06:52.008]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:06:52.168 --> 01:06:55.929]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:58.169]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:06:58.229 --> 01:07:00.389]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:05.570]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:11.151]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:07:14.552 --> 01:07:18.394]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:07:21.576 --> 01:07:23.777]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:23.797 --> 01:07:27.159]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:44.287 --> 01:07:45.508]  All right, my friends.
[01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:52.676]  Already eight minutes and 30 seconds into the second hour, and we just have an absolutely amazing woman on the line with us.
[01:07:52.696 --> 01:07:54.118]  I'm going to try to keep her as long as we can.
[01:07:54.138 --> 01:07:57.701]  I mean, I've been calling her for weeks, and her voicemail's been full.
[01:07:57.821 --> 01:08:02.967]  She has really pushed the electronic voting scam story into the forefront.
[01:08:03.427 --> 01:08:04.769]  She's Bev Harris.
[01:08:05.612 --> 01:08:20.026]  And the UN-controlled agency, under the orders of Diebold, had her website taken down because they put documents that Diebold had on their own website that were internal but that they put out publicly that are news items on her website and reported on them.
[01:08:20.667 --> 01:08:26.413]  And now they've been suing and taking down a bunch of other websites, a bunch of universities, and students are standing up to them.
[01:08:28.098 --> 01:08:42.406]  Bev Harris, just in a nutshell, for those that just joined us and know nothing about this and the touchscreens, tell us about yourself, how you got involved in this, what the touchscreen scam is, how you've gotten in on the secret meetings, and now what Diebold's doing to you.
[01:08:42.766 --> 01:08:49.689]  This is one of the biggest stories of the century, how in America, a Soviet-style election fraud system is being put in place.
[01:08:49.769 --> 01:08:50.650]  Bev, thanks for coming on.
[01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:52.291]  Well, it's great to be here again.
[01:08:53.887 --> 01:09:00.872]  Well, yeah, we started looking into this, or I started looking into this about a year ago, and I was just stunned.
[01:09:01.032 --> 01:09:04.715]  I've been a writer for many years, and I have never seen a story like this.
[01:09:04.915 --> 01:09:09.458]  Every time you ask a question and turn over a rock, you find something crawling under there.
[01:09:10.098 --> 01:09:11.740]  It is just amazing.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:24.671]  What happened is I started out looking at whether, you know, who owned the voting machine companies, found conflict of interest right away with almost all of the companies, including people who had been indicted for some of the, who were in some of the companies.
[01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:27.993]  Then I looked at, you know, do the machines count accurately?
[01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:35.038]  Very quickly uncovered over 100 elections where the machines miscounted by huge amounts, often handing it to the wrong person.
[01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:37.060]  And I finally stopped.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.180]  It wasn't that there was only 100.
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:42.183]  I just, you know, I was dizzy after all of that.
[01:09:42.223 --> 01:09:45.986]  You also found former deputy directors of the CIA in every corner.
[01:09:47.462 --> 01:09:48.523]  They keep popping up.
[01:09:50.124 --> 01:09:52.045]  We say they pop up like a bad penny.
[01:09:53.146 --> 01:09:56.628]  You have also people from the Defense Policy Board.
[01:09:56.648 --> 01:10:16.120]  The defense industry, and I don't mean to sound like I'm some wacko crazy, but I was surprised to find documentation that the defense industry is heavily involved in the voting machine industry, in the manufacturing of both the voting machines and involved also in the new computerized registration of voters.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.541]  And frankly, I can't think of anything more inappropriate.
[01:10:19.561 --> 01:10:24.843]  It's a classic conflict of interest because they have a clear vested interest in who wins.
[01:10:25.164 --> 01:10:34.027]  And now they're telling us they're getting rid of Posse Comitatus, but troops on the streets, Lockheed Martin runs the red light cameras, they're now buying into the private prison industry.
[01:10:34.347 --> 01:10:36.808]  I mean, I guess they're just going to make themselves our bosses.
[01:10:36.928 --> 01:10:39.469]  Lockheed Martin is also involved in the voting industry.
[01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:42.851]  They are involved in the smart card side of it, from what I understand.
[01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:54.636]  They're trying to get it so that instead of you going and registering and then you going and checking in with a piece of paper at the polling place, that you have this voter ID smart card that you go around and do.
[01:10:54.696 --> 01:11:01.078]  They can do all kinds of mischief with that because, for example, you can't see what's programmed on that card.
[01:11:01.459 --> 01:11:07.861]  You have no way of knowing when you put that card into a voting machine whether it has associated your personal information with your vote.
[01:11:07.901 --> 01:11:08.522]  You can't tell.
[01:11:08.582 --> 01:11:09.162]  You can't see.
[01:11:10.169 --> 01:11:22.670]  And again, it makes you wonder why in the world would a private organization like Lockheed Martin or General Dynamics or Diversified Dynamics or Accenture
[01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:27.535]  Why would any of them be interested in making voting machines and registering voters?
[01:11:27.595 --> 01:11:30.556]  And, Bev, they've also been lobbying to not have a paper trail.
[01:11:30.616 --> 01:11:32.636]  They have wireless Internet connections inside of them.
[01:11:32.676 --> 01:11:38.859]  They found them, Diebold, during a California election in 2002, accessing it illegally during the election.
[01:11:39.159 --> 01:11:48.923]  Then, a few months ago, you and the Plain Dealer reporter, major paper in Ohio, got into the, quote, you know, classified meeting with the industry execs.
[01:11:48.943 --> 01:11:50.763]  They were going, we can't let folks know about this.
[01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:52.344]  It could be called racketeering.
[01:11:53.004 --> 01:11:53.944]  All this came out.
[01:11:54.064 --> 01:11:54.665]  You broke it.
[01:11:54.685 --> 01:12:03.488]  In fact, on this show, right when it came out, that day you came on and talked about what was happening with these documents that you got off the Diebold website.
[01:12:03.828 --> 01:12:05.629]  Break down what's happened since then.
[01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:10.571]  Well, there's actually been two different things.
[01:12:10.671 --> 01:12:11.471]  People get confused.
[01:12:11.491 --> 01:12:17.774]  There was a set of documents, a huge stash that I found in January of 2003 that had about 40,000 program files and vote files.
[01:12:20.675 --> 01:12:30.001]  Then, in August, I was contacted by a person who had had some inside access who leaked internal memos.
[01:12:30.482 --> 01:12:33.063]  So you see, the first batch was programs and things like that.
[01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:37.126]  The second batch was memos where they were writing back and forth what they were doing with these things.
[01:12:37.146 --> 01:12:41.609]  And now they've had Diebold engineers go public and say, we ship out machines that didn't even work.
[01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:44.243]  Hundreds of memos like that.
[01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:50.267]  They just say, well, you know, sorry, that part's broken, but we'll just put this patch on it, you know, and they don't get the thing certified.
[01:12:50.747 --> 01:12:56.271]  Well, when we published, we first published some of the memos that were very disturbing.
[01:12:56.371 --> 01:13:07.378]  They had quotes from their principal engineer that said things like, well, I haven't put a password on it because it's handy to do end runs around the voting system using that feature.
[01:13:07.778 --> 01:13:08.999]  That is called a backdoor.
[01:13:09.019 --> 01:13:09.579]  No, it's so handy.
[01:13:09.599 --> 01:13:11.340]  That's completely ridiculous.
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:13.144]  That you would have that in a memo.
[01:13:13.244 --> 01:13:14.166]  It's handy.
[01:13:14.907 --> 01:13:18.214]  Handy to do end runs around the voting system.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:25.922]  What possible non-nefarious reason would there be to do end runs around a voting system?
[01:13:26.062 --> 01:13:29.083]  And here's the headline AP today on InfoWars.com.
[01:13:29.403 --> 01:13:46.267]  Dybul warns on electronic vote papers San Jose, California, despite lawsuit threats from one of the nation's largest electronic voting machine suppliers, some activists are refusing to remove websites with internal company documents that they claim raise serious security concerns.
[01:13:46.307 --> 01:13:47.968]  Wait, the engineers admit that?
[01:13:48.408 --> 01:13:51.030]  Well, this is the documents that they're posting.
[01:13:51.410 --> 01:14:04.257]  The documents show what's really going on with these secret voting systems, and they show it in black and white, and they're authored by people like the principal engineer, the vice president of research and development.
[01:14:04.677 --> 01:14:08.799]  They're the people who are actually programming the machines and the people who are doing the tech support.
[01:14:09.099 --> 01:14:10.620]  They're extremely disturbing.
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:13.382]  Now, they took your website down when you were the first to publish this.
[01:14:13.522 --> 01:14:13.722]  Right.
[01:14:14.318 --> 01:14:18.139]  Right, and it was down for a whole month, which is also completely illegal.
[01:14:18.179 --> 01:14:24.721]  It can only be taken down, it's a controversial law to begin with, but they can only take it down for 10 days.
[01:14:25.201 --> 01:14:26.562]  We were down for 30 days.
[01:14:26.982 --> 01:14:30.963]  We were not allowed to access our own files on our own FTP site.
[01:14:31.323 --> 01:14:33.344]  We were not allowed to move the domain.
[01:14:33.504 --> 01:14:37.485]  None of this is involved in the normal DMCA takedown, which is what they used.
[01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:41.214]  And again, that's an international UN-type system.
[01:14:41.554 --> 01:14:42.135]  Right.
[01:14:42.315 --> 01:14:46.237]  And it's really, like the Patriot Act, it's absolutely misused.
[01:14:46.337 --> 01:14:49.179]  It's used in some cases to stifle free speech.
[01:14:49.579 --> 01:14:53.101]  Because, you see, they don't have to prove a case to take you down.
[01:14:53.641 --> 01:14:56.403]  All they have to do is send a letter, and it can say anything.
[01:14:56.463 --> 01:14:57.504]  In fact, in my case...
[01:15:00.006 --> 01:15:06.571]  They claimed copyright to a link that led to another page, which in turn had a link which led to some memos.
[01:15:07.031 --> 01:15:09.373]  It wasn't even that I had the memo on my page.
[01:15:09.393 --> 01:15:11.794]  So now we have a link to a link to a link to a link.
[01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:12.895]  Exactly.
[01:15:12.935 --> 01:15:15.097]  And they're actually going after that now, by the way.
[01:15:15.537 --> 01:15:19.119]  They've been going after three and four deep links.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.622]  They went after a search engine that searched the documents.
[01:15:23.713 --> 01:15:25.916]  This is... Wow, sounds like a free society.
[01:15:27.318 --> 01:15:38.431]  Well, it needs to be... The thing is, I don't believe... Number one, I don't believe that they can assert copyright on something that shows that they are in-running the system.
[01:15:38.491 --> 01:15:42.997]  That shows power in very high global level wanting to block you.
[01:15:44.162 --> 01:15:44.962]  Well, whatever.
[01:15:44.982 --> 01:15:49.904]  And the other thing that's interesting is we have two black box voting websites.
[01:15:49.944 --> 01:15:51.404]  We have .oregon.com.
[01:15:51.984 --> 01:15:53.545]  We have separate ownership on them.
[01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:55.045]  One is my publisher, one is me.
[01:15:55.085 --> 01:15:56.406]  We have separate hosting.
[01:15:56.886 --> 01:16:04.008]  Now, when they took out my site, they weren't able to get at him legally, and so he got hacked out.
[01:16:04.068 --> 01:16:06.509]  He was taken out four times in four weeks.
[01:16:07.049 --> 01:16:08.111]  Yeah, that's what they do.
[01:16:19.759 --> 01:16:21.780]  It was just, he's finally back up.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:31.205]  In fact, yesterday, for the first time in about two months, both he and I had the black box voting sites up at the same time.
[01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:38.048]  Well, Beth, let me stop you, because the key here is having this everywhere, defeating them on this fight, backing them down.
[01:16:38.388 --> 01:16:40.429]  This shows they are running scared.
[01:16:40.489 --> 01:16:45.532]  This is a desperate move, and you say you've been contacted by a bunch of national media.
[01:16:45.752 --> 01:16:47.092]  They're not allowed to run with this.
[01:16:47.132 --> 01:16:48.273]  This is a huge story.
[01:16:48.693 --> 01:16:49.254]  Right.
[01:16:49.454 --> 01:16:59.421]  There are several national media, very, very large, all the ones you've heard of, and I know for a fact that the investigative reporters want to run with the story.
[01:16:59.521 --> 01:17:02.103]  They're feeling like everybody's passing them up.
[01:17:02.664 --> 01:17:03.124]  They know.
[01:17:03.284 --> 01:17:08.388]  It truly is, perhaps, the most important story since 1776.
[01:17:09.268 --> 01:17:11.050]  And that's not an understatement.
[01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:17.415]  And at the same time, the same military-industrial complex owns the media, and in that plain dealer...
[01:17:18.335 --> 01:17:26.118]  With the Plain Dealer Reporter, they're on the phone with you in that classified little briefing with industry execs where they talk about racketeering and suppressing the public.
[01:17:26.838 --> 01:17:29.519]  I mean, that's gigantic.
[01:17:29.559 --> 01:17:32.060]  They talk about using our friends in the defense industry.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:35.941]  Yeah, that was actually Erica D. Smith from the Akron Beacon Journal.
[01:17:36.241 --> 01:17:38.462]  The Plain Dealer has done some amazing work, too.
[01:17:38.502 --> 01:17:42.544]  Those two papers have been... You know, we do have a free press.
[01:17:42.604 --> 01:17:44.405]  It's just not where you quite look for it.
[01:17:44.765 --> 01:17:52.289]  The Akron Beacon Journal, Erica D. Smith, and Julie Carr-Smith from The Plain Dealer have been just amazing with what they've uncovered.
[01:17:52.309 --> 01:17:54.650]  And are those articles at blackboxvoting.com?
[01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:57.671]  Yeah, there's a lot of those articles there.
[01:17:57.711 --> 01:18:03.234]  That actually also has in the archives the actual documents and the actual...
[01:18:04.034 --> 01:18:06.755]  Transcript of the meeting that we were talking about.
[01:18:06.795 --> 01:18:08.236]  Now what was in that meeting is this.
[01:18:09.716 --> 01:18:15.619]  It was the voting machine insiders meeting with the guy who represents our election officials.
[01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:18.140]  Now why he was in it, I have no idea.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.520]  He's supposed to represent the people.
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:27.503]  And they were discussing not how they can correct the flaws in the system, not how they can make it more secure and give us a paper ballot.
[01:18:27.543 --> 01:18:28.884]  They were discussing how they can
[01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:35.242]  Purchase with a PR program a perception that it has been fixed.
[01:18:36.343 --> 01:18:38.584]  And they talked about we better keep this secret.
[01:18:38.604 --> 01:18:40.225]  This could be considered rocketeering.
[01:18:40.826 --> 01:18:42.647]  Well, they said they better keep it secret.
[01:18:42.727 --> 01:18:45.789]  They better be careful and get legal advice as far as they're meeting.
[01:18:45.829 --> 01:18:47.550]  Now, rocketeering, I don't know.
[01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:51.213]  I mean, because an industry can get together and they can do lobbying.
[01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:54.876]  What was unusual about this is that they wanted money.
[01:18:55.496 --> 01:18:59.420]  They had this group come in and say, we need $200,000 by Friday.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.241]  Now, how strange is that?
[01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:04.184]  And they said that they would take care of the problem.
[01:19:04.464 --> 01:19:07.126]  But you did say in the last interview that they quote, so we've got to be careful.
[01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:08.527]  We can get in trouble legally for this.
[01:19:09.088 --> 01:19:09.628]  Yes, they did.
[01:19:10.449 --> 01:19:13.131]  And then they decided to go out and get some legal advice.
[01:19:13.411 --> 01:19:16.174]  And what was interesting then is they... Stay there, Bev.
[01:19:16.194 --> 01:19:16.914]  We've got a break.
[01:19:17.255 --> 01:19:17.675]  Stay with us.
[01:19:17.695 --> 01:19:18.856]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:19:20.931 --> 01:19:22.572]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:25.134]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:19:49.051 --> 01:19:50.771]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:19:51.031 --> 01:20:02.973]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:20:03.153 --> 01:20:09.715]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:20:09.915 --> 01:20:13.095]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:17.836 --> 01:20:19.317]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.910]  We're good to go.
[01:20:59.856 --> 01:21:01.938]  Simply log on to HerbalHealer.com.

[01:21:06.781 --> 01:21:09.863]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:21:10.043 --> 01:21:15.967]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:21:21.611 --> 01:21:26.595]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[01:21:27.003 --> 01:21:29.746]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[01:21:30.206 --> 01:21:33.069]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[01:21:33.449 --> 01:21:40.595]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:41.997]  That's recovery?
[01:21:42.617 --> 01:21:47.822]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[01:21:48.222 --> 01:21:49.784]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[01:21:50.464 --> 01:21:53.187]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[01:21:57.896 --> 01:21:59.478]  I love the sound of real money.

[01:22:05.663 --> 01:22:10.248]  Learn how to protect your assets with real wealth, not potentially worthless paper.
[01:22:10.608 --> 01:22:11.429]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[01:22:11.489 --> 01:22:11.669]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:19.284 --> 01:22:21.486]  Hey, John Statmiller here, and I have a question for you.
[01:22:21.706 --> 01:22:23.228]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[01:22:23.568 --> 01:22:26.210]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[01:22:26.451 --> 01:22:28.332]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[01:22:28.613 --> 01:22:31.555]  Do you have the energy you need to do all the things in life that you need to do?
[01:22:31.856 --> 01:22:33.657]  If you're like most people, the answer is no.
[01:22:33.997 --> 01:22:37.741]  And that extra cup of coffee or an afternoon candy bar is not the solution.
[01:22:38.106 --> 01:22:38.466]  We're good to go.
[01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:12.888]  I want the listeners to understand that in these companies, you've got senators owning the companies...
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:38.982]  That give them upset victories in their own elections.
[01:23:40.243 --> 01:23:49.430]  That there's deputy former CIA directors and top CIA security officials and big defense agencies
[01:23:50.371 --> 01:23:51.393]  Involved in all this.
[01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:55.838]  And then they've got the League of Women Voters out saying we don't want a paper trail.
[01:23:55.978 --> 01:23:57.680]  Oh, this is for our democracy.
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.262]  I mean, this is so sick.
[01:23:59.302 --> 01:24:01.105]  The average person just can't imagine it.
[01:24:01.525 --> 01:24:07.372]  By the time it percolates down to our local paper, it's they found a few problems with the touchscreens, but they're fixing them.
[01:24:07.412 --> 01:24:08.213]  Don't worry.
[01:24:09.234 --> 01:24:15.778]  They'll have the local media people on the boards of these study groups getting paid to study it, basically paying off the media.
[01:24:15.798 --> 01:24:18.299]  I mean, this is so deep and dark and evil.
[01:24:19.079 --> 01:24:27.664]  Bev Harris, we're going to go to calls in the next segment, but during the break we were talking, going back to that meeting that the reporter was able to get in with you.
[01:24:28.593 --> 01:24:30.536]  They talked about, quote, we better be careful.
[01:24:30.576 --> 01:24:31.357]  This could be illegal.
[01:24:31.417 --> 01:24:35.021]  You were saying it could be antitrust, which is under the rack of tearing, to be clear.
[01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:37.905]  But you said you've got another smoking gun in all of this.
[01:24:38.225 --> 01:24:38.986]  Oh, yes.
[01:24:39.427 --> 01:24:44.573]  When we were going through the memos, we found what really happened in Florida in 2000.
[01:24:46.595 --> 01:24:47.415]  I think we're good to go.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:05.701]  I think so.
[01:25:05.721 --> 01:25:06.001]  I think so.
[01:25:24.153 --> 01:25:28.235]  The spread that was needed in order to call the election magically appeared.
[01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:29.956]  It appeared this way.
[01:25:30.717 --> 01:25:33.739]  What they said to the media was, well, there was a mistake.
[01:25:34.179 --> 01:25:39.122]  Negative 16, that is minus 16,000 votes for Gore appeared in Volusia County.
[01:25:39.822 --> 01:25:43.384]  And they said it was because of a bad memory card.
[01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:44.445]  That's like a bad disk.
[01:25:45.103 --> 01:25:48.184]  Well, the internal memos, that is not what they say.
[01:25:48.605 --> 01:25:50.445]  What caused that spread?
[01:25:50.565 --> 01:25:56.708]  And by the way, that is the spread that was specifically referenced by CBS in an internal document I have from CBS.
[01:25:57.128 --> 01:26:02.110]  That 16,000 votes was what caused the networks to call the election for Bush.
[01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:11.734]  That was caused by a replacement set of votes which was uploaded into a Diebold machine, then called Global Election Systems.
[01:26:12.373 --> 01:26:15.015]  What they did was they had memory card number zero.
[01:26:15.055 --> 01:26:15.915]  That's like a disk.
[01:26:15.995 --> 01:26:16.896]  It contained the votes.
[01:26:16.976 --> 01:26:17.997]  They uploaded the votes.
[01:26:18.077 --> 01:26:18.877]  They were correct.
[01:26:19.238 --> 01:26:24.601]  An hour later, they replaced those votes with memory card number three, which uploaded the votes.
[01:26:24.801 --> 01:26:27.503]  All of the races were correct except the presidential race.
[01:26:27.883 --> 01:26:33.127]  The presidential race took away 16,000 votes from Gore, added 4,000 votes to Bush.
[01:26:33.707 --> 01:26:38.670]  There was another county, Brevard County in Florida, which also took away 4,000 votes from Gore.
[01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:41.152]  They also had Diebold machines then called Globoxes.
[01:26:42.893 --> 01:26:50.920]  The internal CBS report specifically says they would not have called the election without those erroneous votes in the system.
[01:26:51.721 --> 01:26:56.085]  Then Gore conceded to Bush based on those votes.
[01:26:56.345 --> 01:26:57.726]  He wrote a concession speech.
[01:26:58.026 --> 01:26:59.328]  He was headed to concede.
[01:26:59.668 --> 01:27:02.891]  He was two blocks from Memorial Plaza in Memphis.
[01:27:03.511 --> 01:27:05.093]  It was in Tennessee.
[01:27:05.413 --> 01:27:13.421]  When he heard that the vote totals were incorrect, the person that was flagging the fact that they were incorrect was Ed Bradley from 60 Minutes.
[01:27:13.902 --> 01:27:19.107]  He was one of the only people over at CBS that was looking at the numbers saying, we've got discrepancies here.
[01:27:19.147 --> 01:27:20.028]  There is a problem.
[01:27:20.899 --> 01:27:22.440]  He was telling everyone in sight.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:23.801]  No one was listening to him.
[01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:31.105]  Finally, the word got to Gore, and two blocks away from making a public concession, he decided not to concede.
[01:27:31.545 --> 01:27:36.508]  Now, understand that if he had made a public concession, there would have been no Florida recount.
[01:27:37.128 --> 01:27:40.070]  None of this stuff would have been exposed at all.
[01:27:40.928 --> 01:27:45.252]  And again, you have over 100 cases with Republicans ripping people off, Democrats ripping people off.
[01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:47.134]  It's whoever controls the systems.
[01:27:47.234 --> 01:27:50.057]  It is just, this is unbelievable.
[01:27:50.357 --> 01:27:54.221]  And folks, you better go get the information off of her website and clone it to your site.
[01:27:54.581 --> 01:27:55.903]  You know, get it out to folks.
[01:27:55.943 --> 01:27:56.984]  Before we get shut down again.
[01:27:57.624 --> 01:28:04.050]  Before you get shut down again, and believe me, folks, it has been serious for us as well.
[01:28:04.770 --> 01:28:08.573]  We don't get into that here on air, but believe me, we are hurting them badly.
[01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:10.475]  And, Bev, you've got the facts.
[01:28:11.116 --> 01:28:12.517]  Oh, yes, I have the documents.
[01:28:13.017 --> 01:28:14.058]  You have their internal.
[01:28:14.098 --> 01:28:18.141]  Do you think somebody who cared posted those on their website on purpose?
[01:28:18.161 --> 01:28:20.784]  We know somebody who cared leaked the latest documents.
[01:28:21.024 --> 01:28:23.246]  These engineers, and that's not been in the mainstream news,
[01:28:24.847 --> 01:28:26.048]  Oh, the original documents?
[01:28:26.148 --> 01:28:26.408]  Yes.
[01:28:26.848 --> 01:28:29.130]  No, they were actually, this was their system.
[01:28:29.711 --> 01:28:30.831]  It was a bizarre system.
[01:28:30.871 --> 01:28:35.595]  They had a system of just putting them on the Internet site so they could swap them back and forth as they worked on them.
[01:28:36.115 --> 01:28:39.178]  It also, though, you know, gives plausible deniability, doesn't it?
[01:28:39.738 --> 01:28:47.644]  If somebody ever did find one of those files and say, ooh, I found something in here that stinks, you could always say, you know what, we should have had better security.
[01:28:47.664 --> 01:28:48.725]  It wasn't us that did it.
[01:28:50.698 --> 01:28:54.180]  It's unbelievable, and now we see the arrogance of government.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.481]  We've always had election fraud.
[01:28:55.501 --> 01:28:58.323]  I mean, LBJ got in with stuffing ballot boxes to Congress.
[01:28:58.503 --> 01:28:58.723]  Yeah.
[01:28:59.343 --> 01:29:01.105]  But I tell you what, Bev, stay there.
[01:29:01.125 --> 01:29:06.788]  We're going to come back, get into more of this incredible information, and we'll take calls with these loaded phones.
[01:29:07.388 --> 01:29:08.549]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:11.071 --> 01:29:11.971]  We're on the march.
[01:29:12.452 --> 01:29:14.053]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:14.993 --> 01:29:17.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:20.842 --> 01:29:21.663]  Oh my God!
[01:29:21.943 --> 01:29:26.647]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:29:26.948 --> 01:29:27.608]  Yes, it's true.
[01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:30.391]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:34.555]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:29:34.675 --> 01:29:35.235]  You heard it right.

[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:41.620]  The list goes on and on.
[01:29:41.821 --> 01:29:45.942]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[01:29:46.022 --> 01:29:48.183]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[01:29:48.363 --> 01:29:49.564]  This is a limited time offer.
[01:29:49.704 --> 01:29:54.026]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[01:29:54.186 --> 01:29:58.828]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.
[01:29:58.988 --> 01:30:03.250]  To participate in this limited time offer and have your drugs prescribed over the phone for free, you need to call 1-800-615-7094 now.
[01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:04.511]  That's 1-800-615-7094 for drugs like Phentermine,
[01:30:09.853 --> 01:30:12.996]  Ambient, Fioriset, Sama, Ultram, Viagra, and many more.
[01:30:13.236 --> 01:30:17.139]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[01:30:17.159 --> 01:30:20.622]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[01:30:20.962 --> 01:30:23.704]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[01:30:23.945 --> 01:30:30.270]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[01:30:30.570 --> 01:30:36.395]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them but still have them safe and sound?
[01:30:36.895 --> 01:30:37.415]  We're good to go.
[01:30:37.435 --> 01:30:37.875]  We're good to go.
[01:31:06.824 --> 01:31:14.529]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the Internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:19.233]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[01:31:22.301 --> 01:31:22.661]  We're good to go.
[01:31:22.721 --> 01:31:22.861]  I think?
[01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:50.521]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter for only $259 by calling
[01:32:12.893 --> 01:32:16.536]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:32:17.376 --> 01:32:23.261]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:32:28.705 --> 01:32:34.149]  All right, Scott, David, Vince, Russ, Roger, Rick, and many others, your calls are coming up.
[01:32:36.463 --> 01:32:41.646]  I know some of you were holding even before Bev got on, so you can just comment on the electronic voting machines.
[01:32:41.686 --> 01:32:45.148]  I'm sure you want to comment and you can bring up whatever other issue, because it all ties together with tyranny.
[01:32:45.468 --> 01:32:56.854]  Before we go back to Bev Harris, just again, one of my heroes, we're so honored to have on the show a corporate fraud investigator who got into the election fraud investigation and has just blown it wide open.
[01:32:56.874 --> 01:32:58.955]  There's a lot of other great activists out there and researchers.
[01:33:00.049 --> 01:33:03.850]  Before we do that, I want to encourage all of you to get my new video, The Matrix of Evil.
[01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:09.352]  It has Congressman Ron Paul, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, Colonel Craig Roberts, myself.
[01:33:10.172 --> 01:33:12.312]  It has Frank Morales on the police state.
[01:33:13.433 --> 01:33:20.555]  Here are some clips just from the intro, just part of the intro, to the new film.
[01:33:20.735 --> 01:33:25.496]  And the film just came out a few days ago, and I forgot to bring a CD of the intro down to this.
[01:33:26.587 --> 01:33:30.228]  To my studio, some markers downloaded off the web, so the audio isn't as good as it is on the video.
[01:33:30.268 --> 01:33:34.769]  But here's just a minute from the new film, from the intro.
[01:33:34.809 --> 01:33:35.150]  Here it is.
[01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:39.451]  Here is the public plan.
[01:33:39.571 --> 01:33:40.431]  Hide mine.
[01:33:40.451 --> 01:33:42.232]  Connecting us all in by law.
[01:33:42.372 --> 01:33:43.752]  Microchips in our brains by 2025.
[01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:48.733]  We're looking at the literal realization of a military police state in America.
[01:33:48.753 --> 01:33:53.855]  The American people have failed in their oversight of the integrity of our political system.
[01:33:55.267 --> 01:33:59.970]  The prisons, police in black ski masks, a Nazi Germany-like nightmare.
[01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:02.352]  The final target is the American people.
[01:34:02.752 --> 01:34:06.095]  We need to break that connection between the police and the military.
[01:34:06.355 --> 01:34:09.017]  They're charging for weapons of mass destruction because they have marijuana.
[01:34:09.037 --> 01:34:10.558]  We've got to support the Constitution.
[01:34:10.598 --> 01:34:12.800]  We wouldn't be at odds with my own party.
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:14.821]  There really is an Illuminati.
[01:34:14.861 --> 01:34:16.643]  There really are 13 families.
[01:34:17.143 --> 01:34:19.305]  They own the big banks and print the money.
[01:34:19.925 --> 01:34:22.907]  They're in our universities and they're in our colleges.
[01:34:23.308 --> 01:34:25.309]  And they believe in one world government.
[01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:32.134]  And plunge the American people into the deepest economic abyss of a generation.
[01:34:32.655 --> 01:34:39.240]  If we have, or when we have another attack, it looks like they'll come with more legislation.
[01:34:40.461 --> 01:34:40.741]  Again.
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.801]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:34:42.921 --> 01:34:49.287]  Over and over again, government uses crises to scare the population into submission.
[01:34:49.427 --> 01:34:50.868]  That is so important to understand.
[01:34:53.178 --> 01:34:53.939]  All right, folks.
[01:34:54.199 --> 01:34:57.160]  Now, it's a great new film, $25.95, over two hours.
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:59.061]  Get three or more of any of my ten films.
[01:34:59.081 --> 01:34:59.641]  They drop down to 20.
[01:34:59.702 --> 01:35:02.683]  The new book I published, Order Out of Chaos, is out.
[01:35:02.723 --> 01:35:03.624]  It's excellent, $19.95.
[01:35:03.704 --> 01:35:07.245]  Get a second copy for $11.95 as a gift this Christmas.
[01:35:07.886 --> 01:35:09.347]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:35:09.387 --> 01:35:14.549]  You can watch the entire trailer, and it's just powerful for the new film.
[01:35:14.609 --> 01:35:15.830]  It's actually the intro to the film.
[01:35:16.567 --> 01:35:17.327]  That was just part of it.
[01:35:37.814 --> 01:35:38.154]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:38.174 --> 01:35:44.379]  You've got to get a copy of this new film.
[01:35:44.399 --> 01:35:47.021]  888-253-3139.
[01:35:47.902 --> 01:35:59.251]  Or just write to me, and I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[01:35:59.291 --> 01:36:00.852]  There is an awakening taking place.
[01:36:01.252 --> 01:36:02.353]  We've got to push it over the edge.
[01:36:02.634 --> 01:36:05.516]  Bev Harris, before we finish up with your latest revelations that are at Black...
[01:36:06.056 --> 01:36:07.536]  Boxvoting.com and org.
[01:36:09.237 --> 01:36:14.018]  Plug your new book or how folks support your incredible research.
[01:36:15.518 --> 01:36:19.359]  What we have done is decided to give the book away for free.
[01:36:20.059 --> 01:36:26.621]  You can get the regular book at Amazon and so forth, but we also put an online version on for free because we thought it was so,
[01:36:29.741 --> 01:36:30.842]  We're good to go.
[01:36:30.862 --> 01:36:32.002]  We're good to go.
[01:36:32.022 --> 01:36:32.483]  We're good to go.
[01:36:57.057 --> 01:37:01.460]  Well, yeah, and I'll tell you quite honestly, I am flat broke at this time.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:02.721]  I can't believe myself.
[01:37:02.761 --> 01:37:07.485]  I mean, one year ago, I was not in this situation.
[01:37:07.625 --> 01:37:15.071]  But, you know, I just know it's going to come out okay, because this was a story that I knew had to be told.
[01:37:15.651 --> 01:37:20.655]  And until we got it past the tipping point, it doesn't matter, you know.
[01:37:20.895 --> 01:37:21.936]  Nothing else matters.
[01:37:22.036 --> 01:37:24.297]  I have five children, you know.
[01:37:24.658 --> 01:37:26.299]  I want them to be able to vote.
[01:37:26.739 --> 01:37:27.700]  Nothing else matters.
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:28.161]  You're right.
[01:37:28.201 --> 01:37:29.142]  Nothing else matters.
[01:37:29.222 --> 01:37:30.423]  So it had to be done.
[01:37:31.204 --> 01:37:36.489]  And I have some kind of crazy confidence that everything's going to come out okay somehow.
[01:37:36.509 --> 01:37:46.999]  Well, the world keeps turning, and decency and honor and family continues, and darkness is defeated because of the spirit that beats in your breast.
[01:37:47.279 --> 01:37:48.721]  And God bless you, Bev Harris.
[01:37:48.961 --> 01:37:49.982]  How do folks support you?
[01:37:50.703 --> 01:37:53.871]  Well, go to blackboxvoting.com or .org.
[01:37:54.092 --> 01:37:54.954]  They're two different sites.
[01:37:55.134 --> 01:37:56.317]  .org, get involved.
[01:37:56.478 --> 01:37:57.781]  If you've got the money, buy the book.
[01:37:57.881 --> 01:37:59.685]  And if you've got the money, buy the book.
[01:38:00.614 --> 01:38:06.896]  Yeah, and blackboxvoting.com has a contribution thing now with PayPal.
[01:38:07.096 --> 01:38:11.077]  He's put in just ridiculous amounts of money fighting to keep these websites up.
[01:38:11.337 --> 01:38:11.897]  Oh, I know.
[01:38:12.098 --> 01:38:20.420]  And so there's ways to do that, but there's also what is most important to me at this point is that you get over to the forums.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:24.823]  And post your book.
[01:38:24.963 --> 01:38:25.764]  And get involved.
[01:38:26.184 --> 01:38:28.486]  And point people to your website, point them to my site.
[01:38:29.146 --> 01:38:29.646]  It's simple.
[01:38:29.687 --> 01:38:37.132]  We have people power, and when you move, and when you stand up against the machine, and when you block its levers and wheels, it can't move.
[01:38:37.890 --> 01:38:38.310]  That's right.
[01:38:38.871 --> 01:38:42.853]  And they cannot defeat a swarm of different people coming from all different things.
[01:38:43.213 --> 01:38:45.594]  All these little things are what's killing them.
[01:38:46.094 --> 01:38:46.575]  That's it.
[01:38:46.595 --> 01:38:50.477]  You get a big organization with some charismatic leader, and they can decapitate that.
[01:38:50.857 --> 01:38:52.117]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:38:52.157 --> 01:38:54.899]  It's like, where are all these people coming from, and why are they so angry?
[01:38:54.919 --> 01:38:54.999]  Yeah.
[01:38:55.519 --> 01:38:56.000]  Well, that's it.
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:56.300]  No, no.
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:57.021]  I mean, this is exact.
[01:38:57.041 --> 01:38:59.724]  People say, be our leader, Alex, or this person's our leader.
[01:38:59.764 --> 01:38:59.945]  No.
[01:39:00.365 --> 01:39:06.813]  All of us leaders on different issues, being educated, being fiery, confrontational politics, not backing down.
[01:39:06.873 --> 01:39:08.355]  It's our country, our republic.
[01:39:08.615 --> 01:39:09.456]  We're not giving it up.
[01:39:09.496 --> 01:39:09.857]  Now, Bev...
[01:39:10.794 --> 01:39:11.835]  Where is it going from here?
[01:39:11.895 --> 01:39:12.756]  It's now in the AP.
[01:39:12.796 --> 01:39:14.637]  It's now in Reuters, a watered-down version.
[01:39:14.677 --> 01:39:18.340]  Millions of people are finding out that the touchscreens are basically run by the CIA.
[01:39:18.981 --> 01:39:20.322]  They're learning of all this stuff.
[01:39:20.382 --> 01:39:21.242]  Where does it go from here?
[01:39:21.543 --> 01:39:27.327]  Okay, the next two chapters to go online, which will be up within the next 48 hours, tell us where we go from here.
[01:39:27.948 --> 01:39:30.550]  And you'll absolutely love them.
[01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:37.115]  It's called Practical Activism, and it is stuff that fits every person's lifestyle and talents and desires.
[01:39:37.715 --> 01:39:38.076]  I think so.
[01:40:00.377 --> 01:40:00.818]  Exactly.
[01:40:00.858 --> 01:40:03.660]  People sit there sucking their thumbs, going, there's nothing we can do.
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:05.481]  Folks, I have done a lot.
[01:40:05.661 --> 01:40:06.882]  I've stopped legislation.
[01:40:07.262 --> 01:40:08.023]  You've done a lot.
[01:40:08.063 --> 01:40:10.464]  We stopped them killing Terry Schiavo.
[01:40:10.925 --> 01:40:16.569]  The bottom line... It is amazing what one person can do, and each one of you out there is one person.
[01:40:18.499 --> 01:40:21.860]  So what is the defense agencies?
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:23.981]  What are they doing to counter you?
[01:40:25.041 --> 01:40:26.262]  Well, you know what?
[01:40:26.822 --> 01:40:28.222]  They'll do whatever they're going to do.
[01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:29.783]  But here's what we need to do.
[01:40:29.903 --> 01:40:35.145]  We need to first get an immediate moratorium on using this machine, starting with the next primary elections.
[01:40:35.585 --> 01:40:39.086]  We need to go to paper ballots immediately for the next primaries.
[01:40:39.186 --> 01:40:40.867]  And then, here is my proposal.
[01:40:40.927 --> 01:40:41.847]  It's a radical one.
[01:40:42.287 --> 01:40:47.789]  We put a public debate out as to what kind of voting system we want, and then we vote on it as a nation.
[01:40:49.111 --> 01:40:50.492]  What a concept, huh?
[01:40:50.792 --> 01:40:55.235]  We do not have a group of experts in a private room telling us how we're going to vote.
[01:40:55.295 --> 01:40:57.797]  If we're going to change it, we vote on it.
[01:40:58.057 --> 01:41:03.600]  And then saying it's proprietary secret code so you can't look under the hood.
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:04.201]  Exactly.
[01:41:05.722 --> 01:41:07.163]  If we're going to do that, that's fine.
[01:41:07.383 --> 01:41:08.083]  Let's vote on it.
[01:41:08.143 --> 01:41:10.965]  Let's decide that as a country that that's how we want to go.
[01:41:11.105 --> 01:41:14.707]  We will not have other people telling us that that's how we're going to go.
[01:41:14.927 --> 01:41:15.948]  We will decide.
[01:41:16.088 --> 01:41:17.229]  It is our vote.
[01:41:17.709 --> 01:41:23.631]  So that is the direction that I'm going to be pointing the thousands of activists that have come to me.
[01:41:23.831 --> 01:41:27.173]  I wonder if people realize how big this is.
[01:41:27.653 --> 01:41:37.136]  We really are a shadowy group of elected officials, CIA, private defense agencies, taking away our right to vote, taking away the receipts.
[01:41:37.196 --> 01:41:40.418]  We've caught them manipulating votes from California to Florida.
[01:41:40.758 --> 01:41:41.338]  We've caught them...
[01:41:41.718 --> 01:41:42.258]  Absolutely.
[01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:14.117]  And when you see Chapter 13 come out in the next 48 hours, that's going to tell you, you will find that no matter who you are, it fits you.
[01:42:14.477 --> 01:42:17.158]  You can do something, even if you don't have a lot of time.
[01:42:18.598 --> 01:42:19.158]  Unbelievable.
[01:42:19.178 --> 01:42:20.899]  Let's take some calls, Bev.
[01:42:21.499 --> 01:42:23.080]  Let's talk to Scott in Colorado.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:23.880]  Scott, you're on the air.
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:24.500]  Thanks for holding.
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:25.660]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:26.200]  Good, sir.
[01:42:27.141 --> 01:42:37.684]  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that I've changed my mind on a situation, a show you had a long time ago with that doctor of death from Australia.
[01:42:38.587 --> 01:42:39.027]  Remember him?
[01:42:39.047 --> 01:42:40.768]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:42.408 --> 01:42:45.369]  Well, I was the one that called in there and I disagreed.
[01:42:45.610 --> 01:42:50.291]  I thought it should be a personal right to end your life.
[01:42:50.691 --> 01:42:53.252]  Well, the problem is the state gets involved in that, Scott.
[01:42:53.672 --> 01:42:56.153]  Yeah, well, that's what I said before I hung up with you.
[01:42:56.213 --> 01:43:03.296]  I told you that I would change my mind if I thought it was going to turn into socialized medicine, but I see it's gone a lot further than that.
[01:43:04.987 --> 01:43:05.607]  Absolutely.
[01:43:05.627 --> 01:43:09.229]  It's a very important subject, but do you have any comments about taking our right to vote away?
[01:43:09.929 --> 01:43:12.550]  Yeah, being I'm from Volusia County, Florida, I'm serious about that.
[01:43:12.610 --> 01:43:14.351]  Yeah, I know about the corruption down there.
[01:43:16.052 --> 01:43:17.292]  Yeah, it's pretty serious.
[01:43:17.613 --> 01:43:21.054]  Well, I'm glad that we changed your mind on that, and I'm glad that you were open to that.
[01:43:21.114 --> 01:43:25.856]  That takes a big man to admit that, and I'm wrong all the time and admit it myself, and I appreciate the call, Scott.
[01:43:26.156 --> 01:43:27.177]  Oh, go ahead.
[01:43:28.017 --> 01:43:28.517]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:43:29.058 --> 01:43:34.060]  Yeah, well, this Salvation Army thing over in Iraq, I mean, that kind of looks funny to me,
[01:43:34.736 --> 01:43:40.980]  I've read a book a long time ago called The Bower Wars, or The Bower Wars, when they went into Africa, Britain did.
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:52.487]  And I remember seeing a picture they had of a Salvation Army tent where they had two soldiers killed in it, and come to find out later on that the media came out and said it was all a hoax.
[01:43:53.247 --> 01:43:57.910]  Well, yeah, that's a classic British tactic to blow something up or kill somebody and blame it on their enemies.
[01:43:58.171 --> 01:43:59.411]  Thank you, Scott.
[01:43:59.471 --> 01:44:01.473]  David in California, you're on the air with Bev Harris.
[01:44:01.513 --> 01:44:02.053]  Go ahead, David.
[01:44:03.112 --> 01:44:03.873]  Yes, you there, Alex?
[01:44:04.033 --> 01:44:04.593]  Yes, I am.
[01:44:04.773 --> 01:44:06.195]  Okay, yeah.
[01:44:06.495 --> 01:44:12.860]  You know, I've kind of been watching this thing because I figured all along that Bush really hadn't won that election in Florida.
[01:44:14.041 --> 01:44:30.955]  But, you know, I was kind of looking at it in a religious aspect because over in Revelation, the sixth chapter where it talks about the seals, the first one it talks about a rider on a white horse and how he had a bow in his hand and he was given a crown.
[01:44:31.855 --> 01:44:32.396]  We're good to go.
[01:44:32.456 --> 01:44:32.736]  I think?
[01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:57.860]  And as everybody knows, we had a real interesting election out here in California where we basically had Arnold Schwarzenegger shoved down our throat and we really weren't given a choice about anything.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.341]  And they call him a conservative.
[01:44:59.702 --> 01:45:00.723]  Yeah, right.
[01:45:00.863 --> 01:45:01.484]  Please.
[01:45:01.644 --> 01:45:05.448]  I mean, you know, you look at this man and it was real funny that
[01:45:06.450 --> 01:45:19.198]  They brought up Arnold Grobenegger's past with the women, but they never brought up out here about the racist statements that he had made while he was a bodybuilder.
[01:45:19.278 --> 01:45:27.764]  In front of 200 bodybuilders, over 1,000 people at a bodybuilding dinner, he began to scream, I hate N-words, you're subhuman trash, no blacks allowed.
[01:45:28.024 --> 01:45:28.224]  Yeah.
[01:45:28.664 --> 01:45:31.787]  And nobody ever... Well, Drugs ran it.
[01:45:31.927 --> 01:45:37.051]  ABC admits it, but the executives decided not to run it because he's a member of the Bohemian Grove Club.
[01:45:37.091 --> 01:45:38.552]  Thanks for the call, David.
[01:45:38.812 --> 01:45:40.254]  Bev, comments on California.
[01:45:40.294 --> 01:45:42.936]  Diebold got caught manipulating votes out there, didn't they?
[01:45:43.396 --> 01:45:53.985]  Well, there are some anomalies out there, and there are also some very interesting decisions that were made by the political officials to not do some of the auditing techniques that are very, very important.
[01:45:54.305 --> 01:45:56.387]  They're supposed to put a printout
[01:45:56.907 --> 01:46:02.493]  Of the results at every polling place on the door before they transmit them into headquarters.
[01:46:02.533 --> 01:46:05.036]  That means it's harder to mess with the thing, right?
[01:46:05.537 --> 01:46:10.042]  They decided not to do that, and I called the Elections Division and they pretended they didn't have to.
[01:46:10.082 --> 01:46:12.024]  Well, I pulled out the law, and indeed they do.
[01:46:13.025 --> 01:46:15.588]  The California recall, I never understood.
[01:46:16.534 --> 01:46:18.056]  It's a dangerous precedent.
[01:46:18.136 --> 01:46:21.298]  It's just a method of undoing an election afterwards.
[01:46:21.318 --> 01:46:27.884]  But there was a story in 2002 where Diebold, one of the documents, had access during an election in a county, one of their machines.
[01:46:28.544 --> 01:46:29.225]  Oh, yes.
[01:46:29.385 --> 01:46:39.794]  In San Luis Obispo County, California, they had a file that had vote totals pop up on the Internet five hours before the polls closed.
[01:46:40.514 --> 01:46:50.297]  And I also, by the way, found some Diebold memos which talked about how they would like to build... They're redoing their software so that they can accommodate recalls in all the other states.
[01:46:51.198 --> 01:46:54.919]  And it made me wonder if this is some kind of a new strategy that we're just going to try.
[01:46:55.199 --> 01:46:56.559]  That's what Cynthia McKinney said.
[01:46:56.579 --> 01:46:57.460]  Really?
[01:46:57.620 --> 01:47:00.781]  Yeah, out at an awards ceremony in San Francisco a few weeks ago.
[01:47:00.801 --> 01:47:03.122]  I was at... Russ in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:47:03.162 --> 01:47:03.682]  Thanks for holding.
[01:47:03.722 --> 01:47:04.042]  Go ahead.
[01:47:04.062 --> 01:47:04.742]  Hey, Alex.
[01:47:05.022 --> 01:47:06.123]  Terrific program today.
[01:47:08.058 --> 01:47:17.081]  I was listening to your program yesterday and I heard a caller call in and say that apparently he had been spoon-feeding information to Michael Moore.
[01:47:18.041 --> 01:47:23.263]  And so I went to Michael Moore's website and I was thrilled to see that blackboxvoting.org was a link of the week.
[01:47:24.403 --> 01:47:36.467]  And I don't completely trust Michael Moore because although he speaks of Diebold in his book, which I went and read yesterday, he does hit hard
[01:47:37.523 --> 01:47:41.587]  On Bush regarding 9-11 and the connections to the Saudi royal family and the bin Laden.
[01:47:43.088 --> 01:47:47.992]  He does hit hard on the unconstitutionality and the dangers of the Patriot Act.
[01:47:48.012 --> 01:47:48.932]  There's been a new development.
[01:47:48.972 --> 01:47:52.075]  Mel Gibson pulled out of funding him for the new 9-11 film, by the way.
[01:47:52.095 --> 01:47:52.835]  Well, I understand that.
[01:47:52.875 --> 01:47:53.896]  I don't trust Michael Moore.
[01:47:53.956 --> 01:47:56.938]  He strongly backs Wesley Clark for president.
[01:47:57.439 --> 01:48:02.603]  He's very anti-Second Amendment, pro-gun control, and he strongly supports the ACLU.
[01:48:02.763 --> 01:48:04.925]  Okay, but tie that into the election fraud.
[01:48:05.365 --> 01:48:06.506]  Bev, you have any comments on this?
[01:48:07.262 --> 01:48:12.429]  Well, you know, what's funny is we attract followers from every possible side of the rainbow.
[01:48:12.449 --> 01:48:16.594]  We've got actually one of the most powerful activists right now.
[01:48:16.774 --> 01:48:17.695]  He's just great.
[01:48:18.076 --> 01:48:18.917]  He's flamboyant.
[01:48:19.177 --> 01:48:19.878]  He's in California.
[01:48:19.898 --> 01:48:20.799]  His name is Jim March.
[01:48:20.819 --> 01:48:21.680]  He's a libertarian.
[01:48:22.021 --> 01:48:23.903]  He's a gun lobbyist, actually.
[01:48:24.564 --> 01:48:25.485]  And then we've got...
[01:48:26.486 --> 01:48:33.628]  We've got, on the other side of it, we've got Greens and we've got Libertarians and we've got a Socialist Worker Party guy who's in there active.
[01:48:34.088 --> 01:48:35.809]  I think everybody wants fair voting.
[01:48:36.169 --> 01:48:41.550]  So, you know, whatever anybody... And I'm very appreciative, by the way, of Michael Moore for making us the link of the week.
[01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:42.550]  I think that was wonderful.
[01:48:42.730 --> 01:48:44.531]  It exposed a lot of people to it.
[01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:52.013]  That's my point exactly, is that even though we may not trust him completely and agree with him on all aspects...
[01:48:52.766 --> 01:49:03.443]  I still think that it's important to take the positive aspects of what he's saying and be able to help promote him and help him promote those.
[01:49:03.463 --> 01:49:05.145]  Well, it makes it hard for people.
[01:49:05.185 --> 01:49:06.207]  Most people aren't evil.
[01:49:06.227 --> 01:49:07.008]  They're just ignorant.
[01:49:07.088 --> 01:49:07.969]  It's a process.
[01:49:09.142 --> 01:49:12.483]  And that's what we're trying to do, is educate people, period, regardless of who they are.
[01:49:13.004 --> 01:49:13.704]  Right, exactly.
[01:49:13.764 --> 01:49:20.686]  And what I've been so gratified at, when people sign up at the forums, they come from every walk of life.
[01:49:20.926 --> 01:49:32.011]  And, in fact, some people are Bush supporters, and they say, you know, even if I... And they'll say, well, you know, I support everything about it, but we've got to have our vote or the country will fall apart.
[01:49:34.171 --> 01:49:37.773]  Some of them even think that he did something bad, but still support him.
[01:49:37.813 --> 01:49:38.333]  It's kind of...
[01:49:39.641 --> 01:49:41.042]  It's mental illness.
[01:49:41.142 --> 01:49:42.223]  Everybody does agree.
[01:49:42.263 --> 01:49:45.586]  We need to have a trustworthy voting system that we can have confidence in.
[01:49:46.047 --> 01:49:47.008]  Otherwise, it doesn't matter.
[01:49:47.308 --> 01:49:52.973]  Well, they better hope this doesn't get out, because wouldn't you say it's reached the crest point and that now it's going to come out?
[01:49:53.334 --> 01:49:53.854]  I think so.
[01:49:54.255 --> 01:49:55.616]  We can all do something, Alex.
[01:49:55.656 --> 01:50:03.523]  I've already put out over 100 of your 9-11 Road to Tyranny videos, and today I'm going to order The Matrix of Evil, Masters of Terror, and Police State 3.
[01:50:04.534 --> 01:50:05.134]  Thank you, Russ.
[01:50:05.154 --> 01:50:05.715]  God bless you.
[01:50:05.935 --> 01:50:06.915]  Thank you so much.
[01:50:07.195 --> 01:50:07.815]  Absolutely.
[01:50:08.236 --> 01:50:09.496]  I'll tell you the best activist out there.
[01:50:09.536 --> 01:50:11.097]  It's Christian Conservative Patriots.
[01:50:11.717 --> 01:50:12.497]  You guys are wonderful.
[01:50:13.018 --> 01:50:13.938]  We've got everybody listening.
[01:50:14.338 --> 01:50:16.619]  Roger, John, and others, you're up next with Bev Harris.
[01:50:16.639 --> 01:50:18.620]  Just an absolutely amazing individual.
[01:50:20.658 --> 01:50:22.180]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:23.501]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:50:23.681 --> 01:50:27.085]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:50:27.185 --> 01:50:27.626]  Phenol?
[01:50:27.946 --> 01:50:35.074]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:50:35.354 --> 01:50:39.458]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:50:39.578 --> 01:50:40.019]  Fragrance?
[01:50:40.379 --> 01:50:45.140]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:50:45.281 --> 01:50:49.962]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:50:50.182 --> 01:50:52.723]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:50:53.003 --> 01:50:56.404]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:50:56.564 --> 01:51:00.045]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:51:00.305 --> 01:51:02.647]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:51:02.827 --> 01:51:03.707]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:51:03.828 --> 01:51:13.574]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091, and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[01:51:13.774 --> 01:51:15.976]  Call Cal-Ben toll-free, 1-800-340-7091, or visit CalBenPureSoap.com.
[01:51:21.039 --> 01:51:21.659]  We're good to go.
[01:51:42.749 --> 01:51:49.254]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:49.434 --> 01:51:54.518]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:54.638 --> 01:52:03.525]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:52:03.785 --> 01:52:10.671]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888
[01:52:11.271 --> 01:52:14.914]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:52:14.974 --> 01:52:15.954]  The New World Order.
[01:52:37.005 --> 01:52:41.227]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:52:41.287 --> 01:52:48.209]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:52:48.349 --> 01:52:50.370]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:53.811]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[01:52:53.971 --> 01:53:01.077]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:53:01.337 --> 01:53:06.701]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:53:07.241 --> 01:53:09.904]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:53:10.004 --> 01:53:11.144]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:11.164 --> 01:53:11.625]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:53:11.705 --> 01:53:13.426]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:53:34.991 --> 01:53:36.472]  It's our final segment with Bev Harris.
[01:53:36.492 --> 01:53:37.593]  We'll have to have her back up again.
[01:53:37.613 --> 01:53:41.215]  I've got a bunch of other news we'll cover in the next hour, but really there's nothing more important than this.
[01:53:41.675 --> 01:53:42.776]  We talk about our republic.
[01:53:43.937 --> 01:53:46.899]  Let's talk to Roger in Pennsylvania, then John in Kansas and others.
[01:53:47.119 --> 01:53:47.759]  Go ahead, Roger.
[01:53:47.779 --> 01:53:48.840]  You're on the air with Bev Harris.
[01:53:50.461 --> 01:53:51.842]  Good to talk to you, Roger.
[01:53:52.062 --> 01:53:52.823]  Yes, thanks, folks.
[01:53:52.943 --> 01:53:53.743]  Bev, you're terrific.
[01:53:53.803 --> 01:54:00.748]  And I wanted to ask, is there any possible legal legs to this intimidation threat situation?
[01:54:01.272 --> 01:54:04.035]  Well, this is a public interest, fair use.
[01:54:20.831 --> 01:54:28.756]  ...issue of people trying to control the public trust in voting and then trying to block their activities from light of day.
[01:54:29.557 --> 01:54:34.020]  So really, this is a criminal matter, I believe, now after what they've done.
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:43.346]  My point was, I don't think there could be any copyright interest there, and therefore, is it possible maybe to seek an injunction against the intimidations themselves, and God bless them.
[01:54:43.366 --> 01:54:45.087]  That's an interesting concept.
[01:54:45.147 --> 01:54:45.687]  I like that.
[01:54:45.847 --> 01:54:49.530]  That's actually somewhat fresh, and we've kicked this one around a good bit.
[01:54:49.890 --> 01:55:03.323]  What he's saying is if the copyright claim doesn't hold up, then you go after them with an injunction, and actually we could probably go after them with something like tortious interference for shutting down this website.
[01:55:03.703 --> 01:55:10.169]  It's difficult because this DMCA law lets them do it with, to some degree, impunity.
[01:55:10.289 --> 01:55:11.590]  But it says 10 days.
[01:55:11.610 --> 01:55:12.511]  They did 30 days.
[01:55:12.531 --> 01:55:13.332]  You can get damages.
[01:55:13.352 --> 01:55:13.452]  Right.
[01:55:14.853 --> 01:55:19.716]  I am in the process now of getting written statements from each of the parties involved.
[01:55:20.056 --> 01:55:21.017]  And it's so interesting.
[01:55:21.037 --> 01:55:22.458]  They keep pointing fingers at each other.
[01:55:22.498 --> 01:55:23.419]  Well, it wasn't my decision.
[01:55:23.439 --> 01:55:24.639]  It was this person's decision.
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:31.344]  At some point, all the fingers are going to point to one person, and then we probably will take legal action.
[01:55:31.784 --> 01:55:34.006]  Okay, so basically you're kind of in depositions right now.
[01:55:34.507 --> 01:55:37.890]  Yeah, well, not that far along, but we're at the early stages.
[01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:38.930]  You're getting the statements.
[01:55:39.051 --> 01:55:40.772]  You're trying to find out the culpable party.
[01:55:41.032 --> 01:55:41.232]  Yep.
[01:55:41.813 --> 01:55:43.274]  Let's talk to John in Kansas.
[01:55:43.314 --> 01:55:44.115]  John, you're on the air.
[01:55:44.155 --> 01:55:44.575]  Go ahead.
[01:55:44.595 --> 01:55:47.658]  Good to talk to you, John.
[01:55:47.678 --> 01:55:48.299]  You're on the air.
[01:55:48.459 --> 01:55:55.205]  Good afternoon, and may the blood of Jesus Christ and Nazareth cover you and Miss Harris.
[01:55:58.436 --> 01:56:02.478]  I'm a little infirmed right now, and I don't have access to a computer.
[01:56:03.419 --> 01:56:11.783]  But I think it would be beneficial if Miss Harris can put out a telephone number.
[01:56:11.803 --> 01:56:13.243]  Okay.
[01:56:13.544 --> 01:56:15.284]  What about a number if folks want to buy the book?
[01:56:15.465 --> 01:56:18.226]  Yeah, or send you a donation or whatever.
[01:56:18.806 --> 01:56:19.807]  Okay, I can do that.
[01:56:20.467 --> 01:56:21.468]  What you want to do is call 336-454-454.
[01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:42.775]  7766.
[01:56:32.452 --> 01:56:42.775]  7766.
[01:56:34.412 --> 01:56:42.775]  And that'll take you to Plan 9 Publishing, which is the wonderful publisher we have who made the incredibly generous offer to make the book available for free.
[01:56:43.536 --> 01:56:45.376]  You see, it isn't just me that can decide that.
[01:56:45.436 --> 01:56:47.217]  It absolutely blew my mind that he did that.
[01:56:47.597 --> 01:56:50.898]  And he is actually the one we've talked about meeting in this meeting.
[01:56:50.978 --> 01:56:52.239]  Actually, it wasn't me in the meeting.
[01:56:52.279 --> 01:56:54.480]  He actually was the one who got into that secret meeting.
[01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:55.680]  He's done a wonderful job.
[01:56:55.940 --> 01:56:57.221]  With the reporter?
[01:56:57.641 --> 01:56:57.801]  Yes.
[01:56:59.238 --> 01:57:01.679]  Okay, let's go through that number again, please.
[01:57:01.859 --> 01:57:02.260]  It's 336-454-7766.
[01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:03.940]  Right.
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:04.301]  Okay.
[01:57:07.162 --> 01:57:12.525]  God bless you all, and I'll give them a call and request.
[01:57:13.925 --> 01:57:15.326]  Where can I send a donation?
[01:57:16.364 --> 01:57:18.927]  They will tell you that when you give them a call.
[01:57:19.328 --> 01:57:19.728]  All right.
[01:57:19.808 --> 01:57:20.289]  Thank you.
[01:57:20.909 --> 01:57:22.351]  Thanks for the call, John.
[01:57:22.371 --> 01:57:23.592]  We don't have any time for other callers.
[01:57:23.612 --> 01:57:30.359]  I'm going to come back next hour and take calls and cover a whole plethora of other news, the latest Terry Schiavo war news, legislative news.
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:31.801]  It's all coming up, Big Brother news.
[01:57:32.201 --> 01:57:33.363]  Bev, final comments.
[01:57:34.366 --> 01:57:38.387]  Well, I think we're really getting, as you said, we're getting close to the tipping point.
[01:57:38.747 --> 01:57:42.068]  We have a lot of work to do to get the information out, but we're getting there.
[01:57:42.509 --> 01:57:47.870]  The next thing is we've got to decide what it is we want, and I'm going to suggest that we focus on two things.
[01:57:48.090 --> 01:57:52.152]  One, an interim emergency plan to get the next elections, which are coming up in about two months.
[01:57:52.172 --> 01:57:53.452]  These should all be removed.
[01:57:53.792 --> 01:57:54.512]  Yeah.
[01:57:54.592 --> 01:57:56.953]  We've got to get a moratorium on these machines.
[01:57:56.973 --> 01:57:57.894]  They're not trustworthy.
[01:57:57.934 --> 01:58:00.535]  We've got to get into the next elections with a trustworthy system.
[01:58:00.635 --> 01:58:03.856]  And then we need to decide what our long-term solution is going to be.
[01:58:04.256 --> 01:58:06.417]  And I believe that needs to be put to a vote.
[01:58:06.557 --> 01:58:06.897]  Okay.
[01:58:06.937 --> 01:58:07.578]  Thank you, Bev.
[01:58:07.618 --> 01:58:08.558]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:08.598 --> 01:58:09.178]  Take care, Bev.
[01:58:10.799 --> 01:58:19.422]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:58:19.642 --> 01:58:20.043]  The Berkey...
[01:58:25.242 --> 01:58:27.963]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:36.045 --> 01:58:40.246]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:58:40.887 --> 01:58:41.707]  You want answers?
[01:58:42.487 --> 01:58:43.367]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:43.387 --> 01:58:47.729]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:48.209 --> 01:58:52.270]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:54.377 --> 01:58:55.658]  All right, my friends.
[01:58:56.139 --> 01:58:59.041]  If I was George Bush, I'd say my pretties.
[01:59:02.543 --> 01:59:03.664]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:59:04.304 --> 01:59:06.246]  We're now 30 seconds into this third hour.
[01:59:06.266 --> 01:59:11.189]  We're going to have wide-open phones and a ton of news I have not yet gotten to.
[01:59:11.249 --> 01:59:14.751]  We had Bev Harris of Black Box voting on last hour.
[01:59:15.892 --> 01:59:19.515]  I mean, look, whether it's killing people who aren't in comas...
[01:59:20.789 --> 01:59:26.510]  Or taking your right to vote away or getting rid of posse comitatus and getting rid of our borders and getting rid of our jobs.
[01:59:27.170 --> 01:59:30.111]  We cover the real issues that affect you and your family, okay?
[01:59:30.131 --> 01:59:31.151]  Because they affect me.
[01:59:31.331 --> 01:59:31.771]  I care.
[01:59:32.391 --> 01:59:33.472]  My life's on the line here.
[01:59:33.932 --> 01:59:35.652]  And whether you know it or not, your life's on the line.
[01:59:36.052 --> 01:59:43.494]  Whether you serve this system or fight it, they plan to enslave you to a greater degree because they're control freaks, because they're evil, because that's what they do.
[01:59:43.714 --> 01:59:44.754]  That's what they are.
[01:59:46.132 --> 01:59:47.513]  And they know we're awake to them.
[01:59:47.533 --> 01:59:48.933]  They know more and more eyes are opening.
[01:59:48.953 --> 01:59:50.414]  More and more minds are being unlocked.
[01:59:50.734 --> 01:59:51.455]  They're panicking.
[01:59:51.475 --> 01:59:52.195]  They're moving fast.
[01:59:52.215 --> 01:59:53.335]  They're making a lot of mistakes.
[01:59:53.355 --> 01:59:56.777]  All right, I want to take a lot of calls this hour.
[01:59:56.817 --> 01:59:59.718]  As I said, any issue, any news item you want to discuss, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:59.738 --> 01:59:59.898]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:59.918 --> 02:00:01.539]  We finally have a few phone lines open.
[02:00:01.659 --> 02:00:02.820]  I'm told not for long.
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:07.842]  If you disagree with something I've said or you have a point you want to add or any issue,
[02:00:14.155 --> 02:00:15.416]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:15.856 --> 02:00:20.779]  Police state going on in your child's school.
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:23.761]  Cameras going up in your neighborhood.
[02:00:24.442 --> 02:00:32.127]  This is a place for us to come together and to talk about it, to think about it, to raise our consciousness level, to expand our understanding.
[02:00:33.447 --> 02:00:34.228]  Toll-free number, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:34.248 --> 02:00:36.029]  All right, there's so much here.
[02:00:42.349 --> 02:00:46.550]  Just a few stories I'm going to recap, but that's later in the hour.
[02:00:48.050 --> 02:00:48.510]  Look at this.
[02:00:49.230 --> 02:00:50.851]  This is out of the Buffalo News.
[02:00:50.991 --> 02:00:54.111]  Village bans paintball, BB, and pellet guns.
[02:00:55.372 --> 02:00:55.952]  There's another one.
[02:00:56.012 --> 02:00:58.112]  Nine-year-old arrested for waving toy gun.
[02:00:58.132 --> 02:00:59.112]  Wait till you hear about that.
[02:00:59.693 --> 02:01:00.793]  Al-Qaeda planned U.S.
[02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:01.613]  forest fires.
[02:01:01.713 --> 02:01:04.214]  FBI memo describes plot to set blazes in the West.
[02:01:04.534 --> 02:01:05.334]  Well, Bill Clinton did it.
[02:01:05.374 --> 02:01:06.154]  Why wouldn't Al-Qaeda?
[02:01:07.296 --> 02:01:20.067]  Lady Diana's secret video diary reveals her grave concerns about assassination by motor vehicle and other secret audio tapes about the royal family raping men in her view.
[02:01:20.087 --> 02:01:22.709]  This is mainstream news, folks.
[02:01:22.729 --> 02:01:25.692]  These are some sick, sick, sick people.
[02:01:26.032 --> 02:01:27.534]  Here's one out of the Jakarta Post.
[02:01:27.634 --> 02:01:30.296]  New world order remains a dream to European nations.
[02:01:32.238 --> 02:01:33.659]  A bunch of stuff I'm going to go over.
[02:01:34.289 --> 02:01:37.330]  Bush warns Iraq neighbors, says get ready to be attacked.
[02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:39.331]  Officials suggest Iraq had weapons in Syria.
[02:01:39.371 --> 02:01:41.391]  How ridiculous, after all these lies.
[02:01:41.771 --> 02:01:49.794]  Right now we're being hit by a super-record solar flare, 100 times bigger than Friday's record flare, the biggest since 1859.
[02:01:51.094 --> 02:01:59.697]  And, I mean, it's just havoc with the satellites, havoc with AMF and shortwave, havoc with... Problem reports are coming in.
[02:02:00.257 --> 02:02:01.538]  News stories are coming in.
[02:02:01.558 --> 02:02:02.718]  It is causing problems, and
[02:02:04.847 --> 02:02:07.195]  According to this, the peak is in about an hour.
[02:02:07.717 --> 02:02:08.499]  It's like Friday.
[02:02:10.209 --> 02:02:13.071]  So we'll see what happens with that.
[02:02:13.191 --> 02:02:16.112]  Also, oil barons, detention prompts, KGB fears.
[02:02:16.172 --> 02:02:16.792]  I will get to that.
[02:02:17.413 --> 02:02:18.353]  Now, this is really scary.
[02:02:18.373 --> 02:02:19.274]  This is really important.
[02:02:19.294 --> 02:02:20.434]  I'll cover this first when we get back.
[02:02:20.815 --> 02:02:22.395]  Nearly everything that people in the U.S.
[02:02:22.535 --> 02:02:24.416]  eat will soon have to be registered with the government.
[02:02:24.857 --> 02:02:28.398]  That means they'll be inspecting you on your back, the farmers' markets, everything.
[02:02:28.599 --> 02:02:33.081]  In the name of fighting terror, FDA antidepressant may be linked to kids' suicide.
[02:02:33.121 --> 02:02:35.182]  They knew that in 1982 when they approved Prozac.
[02:02:35.982 --> 02:02:36.883]  They suppressed that.
[02:02:36.923 --> 02:02:38.864]  I've got the actual government reports on that.
[02:02:39.534 --> 02:02:41.276]  It's like aspartame and the rest of it.
[02:02:42.036 --> 02:02:56.471]  Also, Wesley Smith from the Wall Street Journal writing for the Daily Standard exposes Larry King's cover-up with Michael Cockroach Shivo at a disgusting Orlando Sentinel article where they go, well, so she's mumbling and opening her eyes and following people's hands.
[02:02:56.951 --> 02:02:58.112]  That's what vegetables do.
[02:02:58.232 --> 02:02:59.313]  Okay, she's still a vegetable.
[02:02:59.333 --> 02:02:59.874]  Let's kill her.
[02:03:01.468 --> 02:03:03.169]  So just redefining things.
[02:03:03.550 --> 02:03:06.832]  The media got caught because you went out by the millions and saw the video.
[02:03:07.372 --> 02:03:08.833]  It's at prisonplanet.com.
[02:03:09.094 --> 02:03:12.256]  All videos condensed there for you to see them of Terry Schiavo.
[02:03:12.876 --> 02:03:14.197]  And so now they go, well, really?
[02:03:14.257 --> 02:03:17.459]  You're in a coma when you're awake and blinking and talking and mumbling.
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:20.041]  I mean, it just gets worse and worse.
[02:03:20.081 --> 02:03:26.506]  But we're going to cover it all because knowing the enemy and being alert to their sneak attack is half the battle.
[02:03:26.826 --> 02:03:29.408]  Stream out of your bunkers and engage them.
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:33.782]  As a doctor, you're able to cure and heal your patients.
[02:03:34.022 --> 02:03:36.644]  Unfortunately, there's more than that to a successful medical practice.
[02:03:36.904 --> 02:03:41.748]  Confirming appointments, rescheduling missed visits and sending reminders is inconvenient and time-consuming.
[02:03:41.948 --> 02:03:44.130]  A team of receptionists is a costly solution.
[02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:47.653]  GTI Technologies has an efficient and manageable answer.
[02:03:47.853 --> 02:03:52.016]  Let GTI's appointment verification system be your communications link to your patients.
[02:03:52.296 --> 02:03:55.899]  Find out more at gtitelecom.com or call toll-free 1-877-518-5888.

[02:04:31.238 --> 02:04:38.043]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[02:04:38.384 --> 02:04:39.745]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:04:39.945 --> 02:04:42.146]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:04:42.306 --> 02:04:43.467]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:04:44.748 --> 02:04:45.249]  We're good to go.
[02:05:01.781 --> 02:05:06.725]  The cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:05:06.845 --> 02:05:08.746]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:05:08.966 --> 02:05:12.809]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today and man the guns of the Infowars.
[02:05:12.909 --> 02:05:14.490]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[02:05:17.332 --> 02:05:18.372]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[02:05:30.396 --> 02:05:32.017]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:32.377 --> 02:05:38.119]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:05:38.379 --> 02:05:43.501]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:05:43.841 --> 02:05:53.125]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:05:53.485 --> 02:05:58.427]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:05:58.748 --> 02:06:02.770]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:06:02.970 --> 02:06:07.772]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:06:08.092 --> 02:06:13.995]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:06:14.335 --> 02:06:20.560]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:21.580]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:06:21.661 --> 02:06:22.501]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:06:22.521 --> 02:06:23.722]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[02:06:39.057 --> 02:06:40.158]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:40.818 --> 02:06:41.619]  You want answers?
[02:06:42.399 --> 02:06:43.280]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:47.542]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:48.143 --> 02:07:01.031]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:07:02.732 --> 02:07:05.874]  All right, let's rocket through these loaded phones.
[02:07:06.815 --> 02:07:09.337]  Then I'll tell you about nearly everything that people in the U.S.
[02:07:09.417 --> 02:07:12.360]  eat will soon have to be registered with the government under anti-terrorism laws.
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:14.762]  Again, you'll all have ID cards to have any job.
[02:07:15.062 --> 02:07:16.523]  You'll all be drug tested by the government.
[02:07:16.563 --> 02:07:17.664]  They're just implementing it.
[02:07:18.885 --> 02:07:21.587]  This is out of the Associated Press, by the way.
[02:07:22.348 --> 02:07:27.472]  But I saw Ridge over a year ago lay out the whole plan for two hours with my mouth hanging open watching C-SPAN.
[02:07:28.433 --> 02:07:31.075]  Let's go ahead and talk to Terry in Texas.
[02:07:31.115 --> 02:07:32.016]  Terry, you're on the air.
[02:07:34.518 --> 02:07:35.179]  Welcome, Terry.
[02:07:37.438 --> 02:07:37.739]  Alex?
[02:07:38.139 --> 02:07:38.420]  Yes?
[02:07:39.261 --> 02:07:41.605]  Have you seen the new National Geographic this month?
[02:07:42.827 --> 02:07:44.029]  Yes, we're watching you.
[02:07:44.673 --> 02:07:45.734]  You're watching me, huh?
[02:07:45.754 --> 02:07:50.596]  Well, I don't doubt it with all the stuff that they've come out that you've been telling us about over the years.
[02:07:50.756 --> 02:08:00.881]  Now, again, I'm just guessing you're talking about our headline yesterday with the two sinister eyes, and it says, yeah, the government's looking through all your walls, and they're going to have blimps watching you, and you're all going to get your microchips.
[02:08:00.961 --> 02:08:01.882]  Is that what you're talking about?
[02:08:01.962 --> 02:08:02.862]  Mm-hmm, that's it.
[02:08:02.942 --> 02:08:14.268]  And for all the naysayers out there, just have them read the November National Geographic, and it'll reiterate everything you've been telling us, every bit of it, and some other scarier stuff.
[02:08:14.947 --> 02:08:18.149]  And if you point your finger at somebody, it'll be assault and you'll be arrested.
[02:08:18.369 --> 02:08:21.191]  Well, they didn't go into the legal details, but they talked about how great it was.
[02:08:21.211 --> 02:08:21.431]  No, I know.
[02:08:21.471 --> 02:08:22.752]  I've read the article, yeah.
[02:08:22.772 --> 02:08:23.092]  Yeah.
[02:08:23.152 --> 02:08:25.173]  I'm just describing the world, what we're going to live in.
[02:08:25.593 --> 02:08:25.993]  Oh, yeah.
[02:08:26.074 --> 02:08:27.754]  You know, yesterday I said I'd get to that article.
[02:08:27.775 --> 02:08:28.235]  I never did.
[02:08:28.295 --> 02:08:29.556]  I'm going to dig that out and read some of it.
[02:08:29.856 --> 02:08:32.037]  But for those that just joined us, tell us about the article.
[02:08:32.557 --> 02:08:36.440]  Well, it says, you know, if you think you're not being watched, you're wrong.
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:39.401]  And, you know, and it goes into great detail.
[02:08:39.461 --> 02:08:40.622]  Actually, it says...
[02:08:41.598 --> 02:08:46.259]  Anything, the world of high-tech surveillance, anything you do, you know, you're being watched.
[02:08:46.379 --> 02:08:53.021]  And it says, in the first line, it says, in fact, you've got the article I'm having in front of me, it says, we're looking through your walls.
[02:08:53.061 --> 02:08:54.182]  Why don't you read that to folks?
[02:08:54.582 --> 02:08:55.842]  Let me see if I can find it.
[02:08:56.002 --> 02:08:57.703]  It's the start of the article.
[02:08:57.923 --> 02:09:07.105]  Yeah, it says, where cameras can film you wherever you go, wherever your cell phone can signal exactly where you are, where one glance can reveal exactly who you are.
[02:09:07.185 --> 02:09:09.746]  Sometime in an airport in the lobby of your office, in your bank,
[02:09:10.211 --> 02:09:14.053]  A scanner, get a glimpse of your eyes in a computer, reveal your identity.
[02:09:14.794 --> 02:09:19.056]  And iris recognition, and it just goes on and on.
[02:09:19.076 --> 02:09:27.141]  Then it starts talking about the x-rays, you know, how they can see, you know, body scan you through walls, through just about anything.
[02:09:28.102 --> 02:09:36.867]  In fact, they even have them set up in dressing rooms, saying how neat it is that you can get different angles of your wardrobe that you're trying on.
[02:09:37.047 --> 02:09:37.628]  Yeah, I found it.
[02:09:37.648 --> 02:09:38.128]  Let me read it.
[02:09:39.295 --> 02:09:43.437]  It says, watching you, the world of high-tech surveillance.
[02:09:43.658 --> 02:09:44.418]  And it goes on.
[02:09:44.538 --> 02:09:49.621]  In our high-tech world, machines track personal records, see through walls, and screen facial features.
[02:09:49.661 --> 02:09:52.422]  Will electronic surveillance mean better security or an end to privacy?
[02:09:52.442 --> 02:09:55.844]  See, for those that are in the know, this is meant to scare us into submission.
[02:09:55.864 --> 02:10:03.048]  For the general public, it's, well, most of the police helicopters five years ago, DARPA put ground-penetrating radar in them.
[02:10:03.068 --> 02:10:05.670]  They look right through your walls, a crisp image of everything you're doing.
[02:10:05.710 --> 02:10:07.331]  But isn't that freedom?
[02:10:08.197 --> 02:10:12.801]  And it says, get a taste of what awaits you in print from the compelling excerpt.
[02:10:13.202 --> 02:10:17.966]  Late one autumn day at the Aquatic Center in France, something went wrong, horribly wrong.
[02:10:17.986 --> 02:10:27.454]  Within two well-kept pools and trenching facilities, the center services and modern swimming hole for an entire sector of historic Brittany attracted 150,000 French villagers a year.
[02:10:27.915 --> 02:10:32.459]  Eighteen-year-old named Jean-Francis Leroy was a regular coming often.
[02:10:33.317 --> 02:10:35.198]  And it says that he drowned.
[02:10:35.218 --> 02:10:47.706]  And it says that now, because of the smart computers and smart cameras, now it's going to keep us safe, although the human lifeguards watching the pool were oblivious.
[02:10:48.207 --> 02:10:53.570]  Twelve large machine eyes deep underwater were watching the whole thing and taking notice.
[02:10:54.070 --> 02:10:57.012]  And it goes on to say how it saves all of us.
[02:10:57.032 --> 02:10:59.154]  Just cameras watching us everywhere.
[02:10:59.754 --> 02:11:02.616]  It's got a whole article on it, so people need to read that.
[02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:08.625]  Especially if you show it to people that don't think you're crazy by talking about this stuff.
[02:11:09.465 --> 02:11:10.907]  They're all black and white for them.
[02:11:12.088 --> 02:11:16.932]  What do you think about the CIA running the touchscreen companies and taking our right to vote away?
[02:11:17.252 --> 02:11:17.953]  I think it's evil.
[02:11:19.454 --> 02:11:21.056]  They don't need to be messing around with that stuff.
[02:11:21.396 --> 02:11:22.557]  We all know why they're doing it.
[02:11:22.577 --> 02:11:24.399]  They're doing their own agenda.
[02:11:27.714 --> 02:11:31.159]  Getting their people in there, just ramrodding all this stuff.
[02:11:31.299 --> 02:11:33.302]  We have no say in what goes on nowadays.
[02:11:34.504 --> 02:11:38.830]  And they're telling the cops to push us around and they're basically our enemies because we're bad.
[02:11:38.850 --> 02:11:40.492]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:41.297 --> 02:11:42.758]  Yeah, and it's going to get worse.
[02:11:42.958 --> 02:11:53.868]  What do you think about the Orlando Sentinel going, well, actually, when you look at people and smile at them and mumble and your eyes track when you're told to or you open your eyes and you're told to, actually, that's brain dead.
[02:11:53.908 --> 02:11:55.989]  That's the new definition of a vegetable.
[02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:59.693]  And they said, so you did see the video of her, but really she's still in a coma.
[02:12:01.014 --> 02:12:02.135]  Oh, I have the article right here.
[02:12:02.155 --> 02:12:05.217]  That's the most outrageous stuff that's going on with that poor gal.
[02:12:06.598 --> 02:12:09.581]  You know, I have a nurse, a neighbor of mine,
[02:12:10.003 --> 02:12:15.489]  And I told her that he was a licensed nurse and respiratory therapist and all that.
[02:12:15.509 --> 02:12:16.390]  She said, well, I never heard that.
[02:12:16.410 --> 02:12:17.692]  I said, well, you're not going to hear it.
[02:12:18.112 --> 02:12:20.275]  You're not going to hear it on mainstream media.
[02:12:20.675 --> 02:12:25.201]  Well, also, you're not going to hear about the names unless you have the Wall Street Journal writer on.
[02:12:25.241 --> 02:12:26.482]  Wesley Smith has written a new article.
[02:12:26.502 --> 02:12:27.223]  It's on Prison Planet.
[02:12:28.038 --> 02:12:28.518]  We're good to go.
[02:12:49.264 --> 02:12:50.965]  You know, they were starving to death.
[02:12:51.446 --> 02:12:53.928]  And everybody jumps in and says, we've got to help these kids.
[02:12:54.028 --> 02:12:56.009]  Notice, though, those were foster parents.
[02:12:56.770 --> 02:13:00.052]  Most of these cases of, oh, the bad, it's foster parents.
[02:13:00.733 --> 02:13:06.377]  Like you hear about the person who has the video baby monitor and they're seen beating their foster kids up.
[02:13:06.617 --> 02:13:09.259]  The national news will talk about the mother beating her children.
[02:13:09.439 --> 02:13:11.741]  And every time I read the fine print, it's a foster parent.
[02:13:11.901 --> 02:13:16.204]  And I'm not saying foster parents are bad, but you're five times more likely to be abusive.
[02:13:16.465 --> 02:13:16.785]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13:17.305 --> 02:13:21.491]  You know, they already got a house full of kids, so why do they want to bring on four more?
[02:13:22.112 --> 02:13:24.616]  You know, I don't know if it's the money deal or what.
[02:13:24.856 --> 02:13:26.618]  One summer I worked for a carpet cleaner.
[02:13:26.899 --> 02:13:28.741]  This is why the government wants them to be spies.
[02:13:29.182 --> 02:13:32.687]  Cable men, carpet cleaners, phone guys, public and private.
[02:13:34.098 --> 02:13:40.700]  I was in hundreds and hundreds of houses, and you would go to these CPS nests, and I didn't know what they were at the time.
[02:13:41.001 --> 02:13:42.761]  There'd be dirty rooms, mattresses.
[02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:44.322]  I'd say, well, there's like 10 kids in there.
[02:13:44.462 --> 02:13:46.202]  Well, we're foster parents.
[02:13:46.562 --> 02:13:47.943]  Those kids were so abused.
[02:13:49.203 --> 02:13:52.044]  You'd smell dope in the air with the pothead parents.
[02:13:52.485 --> 02:13:53.605]  It's just a sick system.
[02:13:54.025 --> 02:13:54.405]  Oh, it is.
[02:13:54.846 --> 02:13:55.526]  I'll agree with you.
[02:13:55.666 --> 02:13:56.747]  Makes me want to puke.
[02:13:56.987 --> 02:13:58.108]  Thanks for the call.
[02:13:58.148 --> 02:13:58.468]  Thank you.
[02:13:59.049 --> 02:14:00.470]  I saw a lot, let me tell you.
[02:14:00.970 --> 02:14:01.871]  Bunch of trash.
[02:14:02.411 --> 02:14:06.374]  Let's go ahead and talk to Terry in Texas.
[02:14:06.434 --> 02:14:07.095]  Or who's up next?
[02:14:07.135 --> 02:14:07.935]  Tony in Texas.
[02:14:10.297 --> 02:14:11.238]  I got all these callers.
[02:14:11.298 --> 02:14:12.179]  I can't keep track of it.
[02:14:12.479 --> 02:14:13.500]  Just give them to me in order, Mark.
[02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:14.200]  I apologize.
[02:14:15.941 --> 02:14:17.382]  Okay, Dylan in Texas is next.
[02:14:17.402 --> 02:14:18.103]  Go ahead, Dylan.
[02:14:20.205 --> 02:14:20.485]  Good.
[02:14:20.505 --> 02:14:21.526]  I just want to
[02:14:24.309 --> 02:14:38.916]  Address the listenership out there, anyone who may be coming around, who's read a bit, who's waking up, and who's in a spot where they feel like they're awake, but they don't feel the solidarity of the community because they haven't gone out to seek it.
[02:14:39.517 --> 02:14:52.843]  Most people I've talked to and myself a while back went through at least a few weeks where I was just kind of overwhelmed once I'd researched enough of reporters like you, what people like you had said, and I found it to be true.
[02:14:55.006 --> 02:14:58.569]  It's one thing to be woken up, but it's another to find solidarity in the community.
[02:14:59.390 --> 02:15:05.935]  And if you go and participate at the city council for opposing the Patriot Act, if you go to a U.N.
[02:15:06.336 --> 02:15:15.543]  flag burning, if you participate in anything in your community, we're speaking up and speaking out, you will find the solidarity, and you will be spiritually charged.
[02:15:15.743 --> 02:15:17.565]  I'm talking about this life today.
[02:15:17.585 --> 02:15:18.566]  Yeah, it's wonderful.
[02:15:19.146 --> 02:15:22.389]  You know, it's good to punch the bully back, isn't it?
[02:15:23.081 --> 02:15:26.163]  Oh, it just fills you with delight, I swear.
[02:15:27.984 --> 02:15:36.408]  That's all I have to say today, and I'm glad I downloaded that information off the, what's her website?
[02:15:36.949 --> 02:15:38.109]  Black Box Voting?
[02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:44.573]  Yeah, I'm glad I downloaded that before that information had to get taken off there, and I'll bid you farewell, Alex.
[02:15:44.793 --> 02:15:45.333]  God bless you.
[02:15:45.574 --> 02:15:46.114]  Oh, thank you.
[02:15:47.259 --> 02:15:51.121]  Yeah, God wants us to be up front, fighting, standing up for righteousness.
[02:15:51.161 --> 02:15:52.662]  The whole Bible commands you to do that.
[02:15:52.922 --> 02:15:57.904]  And these sicko churches say, no, you're supposed to be quiet and sit there and suck your thumb.
[02:15:58.585 --> 02:16:04.367]  You're not supposed to be a good preacher like Dr. Wolf up in New York or like Pastor Butch Paw in West Virginia.
[02:16:04.828 --> 02:16:06.428]  You're not supposed to be involved.
[02:16:06.829 --> 02:16:08.309]  You're supposed to love tyranny.
[02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:10.110]  Okay, let's talk to J.Q.
[02:16:10.150 --> 02:16:10.851]  in Oregon.
[02:16:10.891 --> 02:16:11.991]  J.Q., you're on the air.
[02:16:12.011 --> 02:16:13.552]  Hello, Alex.
[02:16:14.032 --> 02:16:14.312]  Hello.
[02:16:14.332 --> 02:16:14.993]  Yeah.
[02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:29.109]  Just pointing out what I pointed out kind of before, and that's this insane policy of raiding Social Security and Medicare to pay for this attack on Iraq.
[02:16:29.370 --> 02:16:30.831]  And they're going to kill the old people.
[02:16:30.871 --> 02:16:31.771]  That's why they're doing this.
[02:16:31.891 --> 02:16:32.452]  That's right.
[02:16:32.652 --> 02:16:34.273]  I happen to be on Social Security.
[02:16:34.613 --> 02:16:35.834]  Nobody seems to care.
[02:16:37.235 --> 02:16:41.038]  Joyce Riley had on the Power Hour mind-controlled techniques.
[02:16:41.538 --> 02:16:43.520]  I think the old folks are being mind-controlled.
[02:16:44.125 --> 02:16:54.695]  One thing you have with the mass media, it has not been mentioned once that the money for going after Iraq and Iran and
[02:16:56.387 --> 02:16:58.989]  Syria is coming out of Social Security.
[02:16:59.289 --> 02:17:00.969]  I have seen the financial reports on that.
[02:17:01.009 --> 02:17:09.273]  And by the way, if you would have been allowed to get 3 or 4 percent, a guaranteed investment on the money you paid in, you'd be getting triple the money you're getting now.
[02:17:09.593 --> 02:17:11.594]  But people can't seem to figure that out, JQ.
[02:17:11.834 --> 02:17:20.838]  Well, they keep raiding the fund, and what happens is, a couple of years ago we had this massive tax increase, so they raid the funds now, and we're going to have to...
[02:17:21.533 --> 02:17:22.173]  We're good to go.
[02:17:22.274 --> 02:17:23.214]  We're good to go.
[02:17:48.948 --> 02:17:49.848]  And he'll support it.
[02:17:50.169 --> 02:17:56.311]  But the mass media has not said a single word about this raping of Social Security.
[02:17:56.351 --> 02:17:57.552]  I wanted to point that out.
[02:17:57.572 --> 02:17:59.613]  Well, that's because he's the Trojan horse for them.
[02:17:59.913 --> 02:18:02.854]  Well, I want to point out that the old folks have been paralyzed.
[02:18:03.674 --> 02:18:04.555]  You know, I talk to them.
[02:18:04.595 --> 02:18:05.795]  They've never heard of anything.
[02:18:05.855 --> 02:18:06.656]  They know nothing.
[02:18:06.916 --> 02:18:10.177]  Hey, they're changing the pension fund rules where you don't own your own pension.
[02:18:11.998 --> 02:18:14.339]  Well, it's... This is criminal.
[02:18:15.219 --> 02:18:15.820]  You know, it's...
[02:18:17.418 --> 02:18:20.621]  Anyhow, I guess I kind of said my piece, but I'm really frustrated.
[02:18:20.661 --> 02:18:22.002]  Well, if you want to add more, you can, Jake.
[02:18:22.042 --> 02:18:22.723]  Do you want to hold over?
[02:18:22.743 --> 02:18:24.504]  Yeah.
[02:18:24.724 --> 02:18:27.127]  Okay, I'll let you finish up, and we'll go to others and get to more of this news.
[02:18:27.487 --> 02:18:28.207]  We'll be right back.

[02:18:31.437 --> 02:18:34.900]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:38.683]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[02:18:42.926 --> 02:18:49.090]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:49.511 --> 02:18:57.417]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:18:57.837 --> 02:19:03.180]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:07.082]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:07.462 --> 02:19:09.343]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.

[02:20:29.406 --> 02:20:30.387]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:20:30.467 --> 02:20:35.249]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:20:35.409 --> 02:20:43.214]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:20:43.474 --> 02:20:48.857]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:20:49.057 --> 02:20:56.041]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:57.461]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:25.371 --> 02:21:25.872]  We're good to go.
[02:21:43.484 --> 02:21:44.245]  We're good to go.
[02:22:05.848 --> 02:22:07.589]  I know this sounds crazy and scary.
[02:22:07.689 --> 02:22:10.770]  You've been carefully trained by government propaganda for decades.
[02:22:10.930 --> 02:22:19.932]  But especially today with a tough economy, why would you let the government continue to illegally grab money from you when there's a simple, proven, and legal way to keep it all yourself?
[02:22:20.233 --> 02:22:25.014]  To get the details and learn the truth, get on the Internet and go to federaltax.net.
[02:22:25.134 --> 02:22:27.075]  That's federaltax.net.
[02:22:27.235 --> 02:22:27.815]  Do it today.
[02:22:34.463 --> 02:22:34.983]  Don't worry.
[02:22:35.443 --> 02:22:36.964]  This show is documented.
[02:22:37.484 --> 02:22:40.305]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:40.625 --> 02:22:44.166]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:22:44.586 --> 02:22:48.687]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:22:49.227 --> 02:22:51.148]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:22:51.988 --> 02:22:54.729]  Okay, let's go to these calls quickly now because I've got a bunch of news to cover.
[02:22:54.769 --> 02:22:58.570]  We'll go to Daniel and Rick and Jim and others.
[02:22:58.590 --> 02:23:00.871]  But JQ, you're talking about how they're...
[02:23:02.307 --> 02:23:09.290]  Getting rid of Social Security, and they're going to bankrupt it even more, bring us more into socialism, socialize the health care, then euthanize people.
[02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:13.611]  That's the admitted policy they're setting up and selling to the people as a right to die.
[02:23:13.651 --> 02:23:16.172]  That means that translates into the government killing you.
[02:23:16.192 --> 02:23:27.476]  But doesn't it fit nicely into place, too, having touchscreen election systems where there's no paper ballot, fraud all over the place, and then they tell you that you vote to be a slave.
[02:23:27.596 --> 02:23:31.498]  Oh, you voted in our democracy to give your liberties up.
[02:23:31.858 --> 02:23:46.984]  Well, here's what my elected representative or the little office gal there said, is that we should not complain about Social Security being raped because it's our duty to accept a little bit less to support our troops in the field.
[02:23:47.445 --> 02:23:48.705]  It's our patriotic duty.
[02:23:48.745 --> 02:23:51.186]  We're all going to have to bear the burden together.
[02:23:51.206 --> 02:23:52.627]  To support our bankers.
[02:23:52.927 --> 02:23:53.767]  Yeah, to support.
[02:23:54.107 --> 02:23:57.829]  We're all going to have to bear the burden together, and if that means a little less,
[02:23:58.433 --> 02:24:00.435]  Money for Social Security and Medicare.
[02:24:00.695 --> 02:24:02.916]  Well, it's our patriotic duty.
[02:24:03.417 --> 02:24:09.882]  By the way, the World Bank with your money is building the private pipeline of Rexon and Mobile and BP right now.
[02:24:09.902 --> 02:24:10.522]  I have that article.
[02:24:10.542 --> 02:24:11.323]  Thank you, JQ.
[02:24:11.943 --> 02:24:12.604]  Appreciate it.
[02:24:12.844 --> 02:24:18.808]  Let's talk to... I guess... I just said who was up next from Texas.
[02:24:19.669 --> 02:24:20.510]  Daniel, go ahead.
[02:24:20.530 --> 02:24:21.931]  Daniel?
[02:24:22.371 --> 02:24:22.631]  Yes.
[02:24:22.952 --> 02:24:24.052]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:24:24.112 --> 02:24:24.533]  Fine, sir.
[02:24:24.573 --> 02:24:24.913]  Welcome.
[02:24:25.473 --> 02:24:25.533]  Um...
[02:24:26.624 --> 02:24:37.770]  I saw you at the Alamo Draft House in Houston on 9-11, and ever since then, man, I've been cranking out two or three 9-11 Road to Tyranny tapes, you know, every day just trying to get the word out.
[02:24:38.170 --> 02:24:39.771]  I have two questions for you.
[02:24:40.071 --> 02:24:45.634]  I heard about how you did a thing with the city council in Austin with the Patriot Act.
[02:24:46.254 --> 02:24:49.276]  Yeah, well, the people of Austin did, but I was there promoting it, yes.
[02:24:50.176 --> 02:24:54.919]  Did you say something that you had that you made some sort of draft, or how could we in Houston...
[02:24:55.413 --> 02:24:56.274]  Do something like that.
[02:24:56.434 --> 02:24:59.116]  It'll be a small grassroots thing, but we need to start somewhere.
[02:24:59.176 --> 02:25:23.452]  Yeah, about a year ago, at the beginning of this whole process, now multiple states, 400 plus cities when I stop counting, I wrote a real city or county law that affects the executive orders, Homeland Security, Patriot Act 1 and 2, and martial law provisions, and it's written properly as a law, and quite a few cities have passed it or passed parts of it,
[02:25:23.652 --> 02:25:24.673]  Seattle, San Francisco.
[02:25:24.873 --> 02:25:29.956]  And a lot of other people have adopted my language about executive orders in NORTHCOM and Homeland Security.
[02:25:30.777 --> 02:25:35.940]  So that is on the Patriot Act section of InfoWars.com.
[02:25:36.380 --> 02:25:39.242]  InfoWars, and it's on the Patriot Act section?
[02:25:39.282 --> 02:25:39.603]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:39.983 --> 02:25:40.523]  I see.
[02:25:41.003 --> 02:25:47.448]  And I've been, another thing, in your 9-11 Road to Tyranny video, remember how the cop stops that lady?
[02:25:48.849 --> 02:25:49.649]  It's a checkpoint.
[02:25:49.889 --> 02:25:50.810]  Yeah, the checkpoint.
[02:25:52.043 --> 02:25:53.904]  Whatever happened to those cops?
[02:25:54.144 --> 02:25:56.984]  I wanted to ask you when you were over at the Alma Draft House.
[02:25:57.044 --> 02:25:57.644]  Nothing happened.
[02:25:57.664 --> 02:26:00.625]  They tried to falsely charge her with assault.
[02:26:00.725 --> 02:26:01.485]  She didn't even touch him.
[02:26:01.505 --> 02:26:05.006]  They grabbed her, and that got thrown out, and nothing ever happened to them.
[02:26:05.746 --> 02:26:06.766]  Nothing ever happened to those police officers?
[02:26:06.846 --> 02:26:11.887]  And then they have the discussion about she may be an evil terrorist because she has a pocket constitution.
[02:26:11.907 --> 02:26:13.208]  Their training has shown them this.
[02:26:15.008 --> 02:26:15.948]  And I'm not kidding, folks.
[02:26:15.968 --> 02:26:16.608]  It's on the video.
[02:26:16.848 --> 02:26:17.529]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:17.569 --> 02:26:18.069]  I appreciate it.
[02:26:18.089 --> 02:26:18.909]  Thanks for coming out to that...
[02:26:19.861 --> 02:26:22.342]  Big movie theater there that we sold out.
[02:26:22.362 --> 02:26:25.944]  200 people got turned away, and Mel Gibson's daddy and family were there.
[02:26:25.984 --> 02:26:26.724]  That was a lot of fun.
[02:26:26.844 --> 02:26:28.145]  Well, yeah, you come out again, man.
[02:26:28.165 --> 02:26:29.225]  I'm going to do it.
[02:26:29.285 --> 02:26:29.925]  Take care, bud.
[02:26:30.586 --> 02:26:31.586]  We work around the clock.
[02:26:31.766 --> 02:26:34.287]  Let's now talk to Rick in Texas.
[02:26:34.387 --> 02:26:35.208]  Rick, you're on the air.
[02:26:35.648 --> 02:26:36.928]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:26:37.569 --> 02:26:47.653]  I just wanted to say the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that Rumseld's meeting with Chinese military officials in order to improve relations between the Chinese and American military...
[02:26:48.772 --> 02:27:02.523]  Seeing what happened to that American air crew four years ago when they were forced down, and seeing the Chinese space launch, what was it, last week with American-designed equipment, they're plainly our enemy.
[02:27:03.484 --> 02:27:08.528]  How can our Secretary of Defense be discussing improved relations between the two when they're getting ready to...
[02:27:09.221 --> 02:27:10.182]  Attack Taiwan.
[02:27:10.602 --> 02:27:17.087]  Well, they're arming them, and they've armed North Korea with the reactors, the reactor transfers continue that are for weapons production.
[02:27:17.768 --> 02:27:18.909]  They've armed Iran.
[02:27:19.329 --> 02:27:25.394]  Basically, it's like the old Western where the bad guy drops the gun at the little kid's feet and goes to pick it up.
[02:27:25.454 --> 02:27:27.276]  When the child reaches for it, they shoot him.
[02:27:28.997 --> 02:27:33.000]  And so, I mean, whatever policy Bill Clinton had, George Bush has got it.
[02:27:33.361 --> 02:27:36.183]  Whatever policy George Herbert Walker had, Bill Clinton had it.
[02:27:37.437 --> 02:27:40.199]  The policies don't change, just the rhetoric changes.
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:42.281]  This is a communist enemy.
[02:27:43.442 --> 02:27:45.744]  You notice the news doesn't call them communist China anymore.
[02:27:45.764 --> 02:27:46.505]  Never, never.
[02:27:46.565 --> 02:27:47.526]  Not even Red China.
[02:27:49.067 --> 02:27:50.488]  Well, that's all I had, and thank you.
[02:27:50.768 --> 02:27:51.329]  Hey, thank you.
[02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:52.210]  That's a good point.
[02:27:52.650 --> 02:27:53.871]  They want you to be a slave.
[02:27:53.891 --> 02:28:01.378]  They want to track everything you do and trace everything you do and manipulate you and police state measures all over the country.
[02:28:02.256 --> 02:28:05.877]  But the borders are wide open and they're arming all these people with nuclear weapons.
[02:28:06.497 --> 02:28:08.377]  We'll take one more call from Jim in Texas.
[02:28:08.597 --> 02:28:10.298]  Now, we've got other callers, but I can't take any more.
[02:28:10.358 --> 02:28:11.638]  I've got to get to all this news.
[02:28:12.358 --> 02:28:18.779]  The FDA antidepressant may be linked to kids' suicides and everything you eat tracked by the government.

[02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:24.560]  The empire's on the run.
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:28.161]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:00.552 --> 02:32:03.192]  Well, let's talk to Jim in Texas.
[02:32:03.232 --> 02:32:03.993]  Jim, go ahead.
[02:32:04.553 --> 02:32:05.153]  Yes, hello.
[02:32:05.533 --> 02:32:05.793]  Yes.
[02:32:06.613 --> 02:32:17.235]  I was laying half asleep last night, and I heard someone telling about someone else that had a bomb that could get rid of fire real easy.
[02:32:17.255 --> 02:32:25.457]  They say it's made of nitrogen, and they can go over and fly over a place and just drop the bomb.
[02:32:26.527 --> 02:32:45.845]  Well, the problem is there's so many fires, and it's like a tender box out there in Southern California, and I'm sure they just don't have hundreds of these, I've read about that, of these oxygen-reducing bombs out there.
[02:32:46.005 --> 02:32:46.225]  Yeah.
[02:32:47.306 --> 02:32:52.091]  They said that they wouldn't even allow them to be in Iraq with this kind of bomb, because it would...
[02:32:54.028 --> 02:32:56.470]  It would be better than what was used in Halliburton.
[02:32:57.851 --> 02:33:00.874]  Well, yeah, Halliburton won't allow water filters to be sent to the troops.
[02:33:00.914 --> 02:33:07.559]  They have to truck in questionable water from Kuwait and Jordan and other areas to the troops.
[02:33:07.619 --> 02:33:10.602]  I mean, it's all about maximum cost.
[02:33:11.923 --> 02:33:13.304]  It's a big cash machine.
[02:33:13.364 --> 02:33:15.185]  It's not just oil.
[02:33:15.306 --> 02:33:15.926]  It's weapons.
[02:33:16.286 --> 02:33:17.447]  It's having a military base.
[02:33:17.487 --> 02:33:18.969]  It's having a political distraction.
[02:33:19.369 --> 02:33:21.811]  It's setting the precedent to invade sovereign nations.
[02:33:23.581 --> 02:33:28.926]  But to kind of talk like this would save lives, you know, like out there, people have already died already.
[02:33:29.787 --> 02:33:31.989]  Yeah, quite a few people died, thousands of homes.
[02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:36.933]  It's horrible what's happening right now in Southern California.
[02:33:36.953 --> 02:33:37.914]  I appreciate the call, Jim.
[02:33:39.175 --> 02:33:39.616]  Take care.
[02:33:39.636 --> 02:33:46.362]  All right, let me get straight into this news because there is just so much of it.
[02:33:47.336 --> 02:33:48.056]  That we need to go over.
[02:33:48.156 --> 02:33:49.297]  I said I'd cover this first.
[02:33:49.337 --> 02:33:49.937]  Let me go over it.
[02:33:50.698 --> 02:33:52.478]  This is from the Associated Press.
[02:33:52.498 --> 02:33:54.119]  Nearly everything that people in the U.S.
[02:33:54.259 --> 02:33:57.000]  eat will soon have to be registered with the government.
[02:33:57.561 --> 02:33:59.322]  This is by Emily Gressma.
[02:34:00.082 --> 02:34:06.825]  Virtually every food product in the United States will soon have to be registered along with its supplier as part of the fight against terrorism.
[02:34:08.587 --> 02:34:08.987]  We're good to go.
[02:34:09.007 --> 02:34:09.147]  I think?
[02:34:25.163 --> 02:34:34.168]  Regulators advice, advance notice before its arrival, two hours for food shipments coming across the border by truck, four hours if aboard planes, trains, and eight hours by ship.
[02:34:34.708 --> 02:34:39.191]  Has nothing to do, they don't search any of it, they already had rules in place.
[02:34:40.180 --> 02:34:41.880]  I saw Reg again on C-SPAN.
[02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:42.881]  He said everything.
[02:34:43.361 --> 02:34:47.662]  Food service, agriculture, commercial drivers, businesses, factories.
[02:34:47.682 --> 02:34:49.502]  You're all going to have to have security clearances.
[02:34:49.522 --> 02:34:51.903]  You're all going to be overseen and controlled.
[02:34:52.043 --> 02:34:53.663]  In addition, anyone importing food from abroad.
[02:34:53.703 --> 02:34:56.004]  Again, we'll have the regulators advance warning.
[02:34:56.364 --> 02:35:00.105]  We are providing critical new tools for the FDA to identify potentially dangerous foods.
[02:35:00.763 --> 02:35:02.904]  And better keep our food supplies safe and secure.
[02:35:03.364 --> 02:35:16.287]  Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson said Thursday, this is the same agency saying irradiating the children's poultry, beef, and pork is good for them when it's horrible, destroys all the food value, allows them to feed rotten meat to your children.
[02:35:17.747 --> 02:35:29.370]  This is the same government that approved Prozac and Ritalin and fluoride for the water, and the same group that approved Prozac when they knew it was causing massive suicide rates.
[02:35:30.495 --> 02:35:37.397]  The Bush administration may propose making food companies notify regulators of shipments from outside the United States by noon on the day before its arrival.
[02:35:37.437 --> 02:35:43.600]  Industry complained that requirement for shipments as simple as daily truckloads of fresh vegetables from Canada and Mexico would interrupt trade.
[02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:45.460]  And it goes on and on.
[02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:47.581]  It's a lot worse than what they're saying there.
[02:35:48.361 --> 02:35:53.303]  This is out of the Orlando Sentinel by Maya Bell.
[02:35:55.041 --> 02:36:00.128]  And it says, experts say camera lies in Florida woman's case, Terri Schiavo.
[02:36:00.188 --> 02:36:01.931]  A potent picture is hard to ignore.
[02:36:01.951 --> 02:36:11.063]  And in the case of Terri Schiavo, the power of her image, propped up in bed, eyes open, seemingly smiling at her mother, has been incalculable.
[02:36:11.676 --> 02:36:14.718]  Well, yeah, you kept trying to say in this very paper that she was in a deep coma.
[02:36:15.138 --> 02:36:31.970]  Her parents have fought in the courts for years to keep her alive and lost her return, but Bob and Mary Schindler won last week in their court of public opinion, thanks in part to TV, Internet news clips that spurred tens of thousands of people to demand action from Governor Jeb Bush and the Florida legislature.
[02:36:32.671 --> 02:36:33.552]  I've seen the videos.
[02:36:33.612 --> 02:36:41.197]  I see the joy in her face, said Cheryl Thomas, who wrote Bush after viewing the snippets on TV news from her home in Montana.
[02:36:41.478 --> 02:36:42.278]  She's exuberant.
[02:36:42.658 --> 02:36:43.779]  Her whole face lights up.
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:46.421]  She's very much aware the governor had to do something.
[02:36:46.782 --> 02:36:56.749]  But many experts, yeah, the hard ones of Shivo, of Michael, but many experts say the video, made public after the court hearing last year, distort the reality of Shivo's condition.
[02:36:57.563 --> 02:37:05.745]  They have multiple doctors, nurses, who treated her 5, 10, 15 years, 13 years ago, saying the woman could have been rehabilitated, was eating food at that time.
[02:37:06.265 --> 02:37:08.586]  This woman has never been in a coma!
[02:37:10.647 --> 02:37:13.667]  And it goes on in the article to say, oh, she's really in a coma.
[02:37:13.948 --> 02:37:22.450]  People in coma have their eyes open, and they look around, and they do things, and, you know, and then there's these right-wing...
[02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:28.524]  People who tell all these lies and they don't want to give her her rights.
[02:37:29.885 --> 02:37:33.188]  And it goes on to say, picture is hard to reconcile with diagnosis.
[02:37:34.489 --> 02:37:47.721]  And it says, according to Pamela Hennessy, a Schindler family volunteer who first posted the video snippets on the family website, Terry's Fight.org in December, recordings energize many of those voices.
[02:37:47.921 --> 02:37:49.122]  And they say it's a turning point.
[02:37:49.563 --> 02:37:50.804]  And they go on to talk to
[02:37:51.881 --> 02:38:12.811]  Kelly McBride, a member of the ethics faculty at the Poynter Institute of Journalism, has said those videos can be taken out of context, she said, by using them as a B-roll, which is the film under the voiceover, or by simply presenting them without context, journalists are inaccurately using and explaining them, and that is swaying public opinion.
[02:38:13.271 --> 02:38:20.415]  You've got the so-called media watchdog group saying that the media is showing this, saying that Terry's okay and it's wrong.
[02:38:21.622 --> 02:38:24.364]  No, they've been saying she's in a coma the whole time covering this up.
[02:38:24.985 --> 02:38:28.347]  So, see, tens of millions of you went and watched the websites.
[02:38:28.507 --> 02:38:29.108]  We've cloned it.
[02:38:29.128 --> 02:38:31.210]  Other websites have cloned it for bandwidth purposes.
[02:38:32.731 --> 02:38:34.472]  It showed on a couple TV networks.
[02:38:34.612 --> 02:38:35.713]  Everybody got real mad.
[02:38:35.793 --> 02:38:38.415]  She's obviously, I mean, it's a joke, but it's not just the video.
[02:38:38.435 --> 02:38:40.717]  We have the medical reports that they've tried to suppress.
[02:38:42.739 --> 02:38:43.919]  It just makes me so mad.
[02:38:43.959 --> 02:38:49.644]  And then now a top forensics pathologist up in New York, very famous murder investigator,
[02:38:50.836 --> 02:38:55.900]  Trauma investigator says it's clear from the spinal scans that she was traumatized brutally and it wasn't a heart attack.
[02:38:56.501 --> 02:38:57.902]  But again, let's just ignore all that.
[02:38:57.962 --> 02:39:03.927]  And the media spins it and says, well, there's been a lot of people saying she's okay, and that's irresponsible.
[02:39:05.908 --> 02:39:08.891]  Comas when you have your eyes open, mumbling and smiling at your mommy.
[02:39:11.333 --> 02:39:18.058]  Okay, what about the other cases where people aren't even just paralyzed, neck down, talking, say, please give me water.
[02:39:18.098 --> 02:39:19.800]  We've listed the names, the news articles here.
[02:39:20.908 --> 02:39:21.889]  This is sick, folks.
[02:39:21.909 --> 02:39:25.310]  They're trying to condition you to just accept killing people that aren't even vegetables.
[02:39:26.011 --> 02:39:28.332]  We told you that's how this slippery slope works.
[02:39:29.052 --> 02:39:30.213]  That's how this operates.
[02:39:31.894 --> 02:39:32.614]  This is out of Channel 32.
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:42.929]  And in Louisville, FDA antidepressants may be linked to kids' suicide.
[02:39:43.369 --> 02:39:49.516]  The Food and Drug Administration says some antidepressant drugs undergoing trials in children, including Paxil, may be associated with suicides.
[02:39:50.016 --> 02:39:50.997]  That came out in the early 80s.
[02:39:51.798 --> 02:39:58.120]  The agency said it's aware of reports in the media and in medical journals about suicide and suicide attempts in children using antidepressants.
[02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:00.860]  Officials said three reports are very difficult to interpret.
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:05.781]  While the agency said there is no clear connection, it can't rule out a link.
[02:40:05.801 --> 02:40:12.783]  The FDA is alerting doctors about reports of suicidal thinking among juveniles who are participating in clinical studies.
[02:40:13.383 --> 02:40:18.244]  By the way, since they brought this into the juvenile, that's when the juvenile suicide exploded.
[02:40:18.264 --> 02:40:20.725]  The graphs are exactly the same.
[02:40:20.785 --> 02:40:21.285]  It's amazing.
[02:40:22.082 --> 02:40:25.804]  Put you into a dreamlike state, a mesmerized type state.
[02:40:26.084 --> 02:40:29.005]  Why are they in Europe then stopping giving it to children?
[02:40:32.967 --> 02:40:34.148]  Why is that happening?
[02:40:34.548 --> 02:40:35.669]  Why is that developing?
[02:40:37.770 --> 02:40:38.350]  Think about it.
[02:40:39.010 --> 02:40:43.893]  Here is another report that I think you'll find extremely interesting.
[02:40:45.816 --> 02:40:47.557]  Extremely interesting.
[02:40:47.717 --> 02:40:55.500]  And this, too, is from the Austin American Statesman Metro section today.
[02:40:57.621 --> 02:40:59.382]  And this is happening all over the country.
[02:40:59.442 --> 02:41:00.842]  They have this federally.
[02:41:00.902 --> 02:41:02.063]  They mandate it to the states.
[02:41:02.123 --> 02:41:02.983]  The states pass it.
[02:41:03.023 --> 02:41:05.724]  And I'm not sure of the total number, but it's over 20 states.
[02:41:05.764 --> 02:41:06.765]  Last time I saw the numbers.
[02:41:07.625 --> 02:41:09.526]  Welfare change is coming.
[02:41:10.406 --> 02:41:12.067]  And, see, they force you basically onto welfare.
[02:41:12.745 --> 02:41:17.106]  Amended rules spark outcry among those who say agency violated Open Meetings Act.
[02:41:17.626 --> 02:41:28.969]  A state agency has voted to cut off Medicaid benefits to welfare recipients, a bunch of others too, who don't follow rules that include immunizing their children and avoiding illegal drugs.
[02:41:29.629 --> 02:41:31.910]  Did they mix immunizing children with not taking drugs?
[02:41:32.754 --> 02:41:35.056]  And in England, they've caught them without even a law.
[02:41:35.417 --> 02:41:41.982]  They've been ordered to refuse families even emergency care if they refuse to vaccinate their children as autism explodes.
[02:41:42.283 --> 02:41:46.487]  They're putting bioweapons in these, binding it to what the supposed vaccine is for.
[02:41:47.748 --> 02:41:53.032]  The Texas Workforce Commission approved the change 3-0 Tuesday, but didn't immediately make the rule public.
[02:41:53.493 --> 02:41:59.138]  Commission spokesman Larry Jones said the agency was making significant changes that would delay the rule's release immediately.
[02:42:00.114 --> 02:42:04.935]  Until today, once the agency files the finished product, the rules will take effect within 20 days.
[02:42:05.735 --> 02:42:07.936]  See, they don't want the general public to know about this.
[02:42:09.196 --> 02:42:12.117]  And then again, to go to public school, they're trying to make it the law, when it's not the law.
[02:42:12.817 --> 02:42:19.379]  The delayed release angered Scott McCrown, executive director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, nonprofit research group.
[02:42:19.419 --> 02:42:24.700]  It's clear, violation in my mind of the Open Meetings Act, said McCrown, a former state district judge.
[02:42:25.743 --> 02:42:31.127]  And it goes, the rule applies to adults who receive Medicaid, federal health insurance for low-income Americans.
[02:42:31.707 --> 02:42:33.688]  They've got to force everybody onto the vaccines.
[02:42:35.009 --> 02:42:36.390]  And boy, they'll peddle this stuff.
[02:42:36.430 --> 02:42:40.993]  If you won't give your child a tetanus shot, they'll try to refuse to sew them up if they get cut.
[02:42:41.573 --> 02:42:43.675]  But it's the stuff they're adding to those tetanus shots.
[02:42:43.775 --> 02:42:44.675]  We've got the studies.
[02:42:44.936 --> 02:42:45.896]  We've got the reports.
[02:42:46.757 --> 02:42:49.138]  Vaccines would be good if they weren't poisoning them.
[02:42:49.158 --> 02:42:50.059]  Do you understand that?
[02:42:53.058 --> 02:42:56.359]  Did you know that I, today, talked to a doctor?
[02:42:57.620 --> 02:43:10.946]  Okay, I talked to a doctor, a family practitioner, who told me, he said, Alex, they're still giving 30-year-old polio oral vaccine that is not supposed to be given in this country at major health clinics in Austin.
[02:43:12.146 --> 02:43:18.849]  And I said, you mean they're giving the drop in the mouth that has the SV40 cancer virus in it?
[02:43:18.949 --> 02:43:19.410]  It's admitted.
[02:43:19.710 --> 02:43:20.130]  He said, yeah.
[02:43:21.815 --> 02:43:28.379]  He said, that's only authorized for third world use because, quote, it gives people secondary immunity because it goes into the sewer system and into the water supply.
[02:43:28.739 --> 02:43:29.399]  Oh, yeah.
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:32.921]  I mean, come on.
[02:43:34.402 --> 02:43:35.422]  Come on, folks.
[02:43:38.484 --> 02:43:39.845]  They hold you hostage.
[02:43:41.698 --> 02:43:57.377]  And see, if they didn't have vaccine immunity and this vaccine fund that quietly pays people off, a poultry son, you know, your 18-month-old toddler, takes the vaccine and was running around happy, smiling, hours later is having convulsions and is in a vegetable or gets autistic.
[02:43:57.397 --> 02:44:00.080]  I mean, this is just hundreds of thousands.
[02:44:00.261 --> 02:44:01.202]  It's a nightmare!
[02:44:03.877 --> 02:44:05.899]  Like that movie, what is it, Brain Candy?
[02:44:05.999 --> 02:44:12.947]  It's a big pharmacological company and they have these big warehouses of people because a high percentage of the people that take the happy drug end up being vegetables.
[02:44:14.068 --> 02:44:18.172]  It's kind of a satire, but I just can't handle it anymore, folks.
[02:44:18.232 --> 02:44:19.013]  I can't handle it.
[02:44:19.033 --> 02:44:22.336]  I mean, don't you think I'd like to take advantage of the vaccines?
[02:44:23.057 --> 02:44:24.278]  Your children can take advantage of them.
[02:44:24.319 --> 02:44:25.199]  You can't trust them.
[02:44:25.219 --> 02:44:26.381]  They're bioweapons.
[02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:33.721]  They got stuff in the vaccine that attacks your baby's cerebral cortex, folks.
[02:44:33.901 --> 02:44:36.502]  It just comes out and reduces their IQ.
[02:44:36.582 --> 02:44:40.643]  And when you get an overburn, an overreaction, you get major brain damage.
[02:44:41.883 --> 02:44:43.743]  They're trying to reduce the IQ across the board.
[02:44:43.763 --> 02:44:49.945]  They've been caught doing it, sterilizing women with tetanus shots with an added hormone bonded to the pathogen.
[02:44:53.107 --> 02:44:54.007]  Oh, just trust us.
[02:44:54.147 --> 02:44:55.148]  I'm a good doctor.
[02:44:55.568 --> 02:44:56.328]  Take your shot.
[02:44:56.488 --> 02:44:57.809]  I wouldn't do something bad like that.
[02:44:57.849 --> 02:45:00.230]  Yeah, you didn't make the vaccine, Mac.
[02:45:02.971 --> 02:45:08.653]  It's very, very, very, very scary what's happening.
[02:45:09.934 --> 02:45:10.294]  Okay.
[02:45:12.175 --> 02:45:15.716]  Got a bunch of other news here we're going to try to accelerate through.
[02:45:16.216 --> 02:45:18.997]  Officials suggest Iraq hid weapons in Syria.
[02:45:19.658 --> 02:45:20.158]  Washington...
[02:45:22.253 --> 02:45:38.682]  And it goes on, the director of the top American spy agency said Tuesday that he believed the material from Iraq's illicit weapons program was transported to Syria and perhaps other countries as part of an effort by Iraqis to disperse and destroy evidence immediately before the recent war.
[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:54.607]  The official, James Clapper, Jr., retired Air Force Lieutenant General, said satellite images showing a heavy flow of traffic from Iraq into Syria just before the American invasion in March had led him to believe unquestionably that illicit weapons material had moved outside Iraq.
[02:45:55.868 --> 02:45:59.570]  Oh, yeah, people never flee a country that's about to be under heavy bombardment.
[02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:02.211]  No one's ever heard of refugees.
[02:46:02.671 --> 02:46:06.353]  They go on to lift large convoys of trucks and cars and leaving.
[02:46:06.613 --> 02:46:08.514]  Now, we know Saddam flew a bunch of his jets.
[02:46:09.885 --> 02:46:12.987]  There's French and Russian jets out to Iran in 91.
[02:46:13.287 --> 02:46:17.689]  On the eve of the Gulf War in 1990, we know that happened.
[02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:21.972]  But what about this?
[02:46:22.052 --> 02:46:29.916]  I mean, they've been caught lying about depleted uranium or stuff that they bought from, supposedly bought from Niger.
[02:46:29.956 --> 02:46:35.279]  They've been caught lying about mobile weapons trucks that were for pumping up surveillance blimps.
[02:46:35.299 --> 02:46:38.641]  They've been caught lying about mass graves, caught lying about 10 different weapons sites.
[02:46:39.324 --> 02:46:41.446]  Caught lying about fake dossiers.
[02:46:42.466 --> 02:46:43.247]  It goes on and on.
[02:46:43.287 --> 02:46:44.928]  But, oh, they've got new lies for old.
[02:46:45.148 --> 02:46:45.929]  Oh, yeah.
[02:46:46.970 --> 02:46:47.590]  You know.
[02:46:49.652 --> 02:46:50.032]  Yeah.
[02:46:51.373 --> 02:46:52.274]  We're sure.
[02:46:52.314 --> 02:46:53.314]  They shipped them into Syria.
[02:46:53.334 --> 02:46:54.755]  Now we've got to go into Syria, see?
[02:46:56.537 --> 02:46:57.337]  Just unbelievable.
[02:46:57.677 --> 02:46:59.999]  And Bush warns Iraq neighbors, don't aid them.
[02:47:00.479 --> 02:47:01.140]  Don't help them.
[02:47:02.901 --> 02:47:05.963]  In about 12 minutes, let's say 3 p.m.
[02:47:06.084 --> 02:47:06.464]  Eastern,
[02:47:07.825 --> 02:47:08.586]  We're good to go.
[02:47:23.419 --> 02:47:26.280]  And that it might even hamper firefighting efforts in California.
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:28.741]  This is from the Associated Press science section.
[02:47:29.361 --> 02:47:37.764]  It's headed straight for us like a freight train, said John Cole, a solar astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.
[02:47:38.025 --> 02:47:38.845]  This is the real thing.
[02:47:38.885 --> 02:47:42.686]  Predictions are it could strike Earth's magnetic field by midday Wednesday.
[02:47:43.407 --> 02:47:46.788]  The explosion of gas and charged particles into space from the corona...
[02:47:47.898 --> 02:47:49.039]  What is going on with the sun, folks?
[02:48:17.722 --> 02:48:21.065]  And it can knock out microwave communication towers and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:48:22.786 --> 02:48:25.468]  We'll find out in about 15 minutes, 10 minutes, won't we?
[02:48:25.868 --> 02:48:28.791]  It's moving at over 1.2 million miles an hour.
[02:48:29.471 --> 02:48:30.572]  1.2 million miles an hour.
[02:48:30.592 --> 02:48:35.436]  When we get back, oil baron detention prompts KGB fears.
[02:48:36.436 --> 02:48:42.701]  We'll also get into a 9-year-old arrested for police for playing with a toy gun.
[02:48:42.741 --> 02:48:46.324]  His mother said, please don't arrest him, so they slammed her down and took her to jail.
[02:48:47.466 --> 02:48:53.089]  And, yeah, I'm going to play about a minute of the, not the whole thing, of the trailer for Matrix of Evil, which is the intro to the film.
[02:48:53.650 --> 02:49:00.714]  When we get back, some of the interesting clips of Ron Paul saying, you know, people in Washington believe in world government, and Cynthia McKinney and others.
[02:49:00.754 --> 02:49:01.434]  That's about a minute long.
[02:49:01.474 --> 02:49:02.675]  We'll air that when we get back, too.
[02:49:03.797 --> 02:49:05.618]  And I'm sorry we don't have any time to take any other calls.
[02:49:05.638 --> 02:49:22.443]  And if you want to see all the news, science, the technology, the medical, the environmental, the Second Amendment, the legislation, the global news, local news, regional news, key stuff, it's at presentplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:49:22.483 --> 02:49:26.624]  And be sure and go to those websites and get our new books and new films because it supports us.
[02:49:27.204 --> 02:49:29.305]  Number two, number one, it's waking folks up.
[02:49:31.158 --> 02:49:35.503]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:35.683 --> 02:49:40.109]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:40.269 --> 02:49:44.634]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:49:44.694 --> 02:49:45.995]  The New World Order.
[02:49:46.676 --> 02:49:47.117]  Can emerge.
[02:49:47.818 --> 02:49:52.022]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:52.102 --> 02:49:59.030]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:59.170 --> 02:50:01.153]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:50:01.533 --> 02:50:11.876]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:50:12.156 --> 02:50:17.498]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:50:26.601 --> 02:50:27.121]  253-3139.
[02:50:27.621 --> 02:50:30.142]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:50:30.482 --> 02:50:32.442]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:50:32.542 --> 02:50:43.245]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:50:43.625 --> 02:50:48.146]  The Berkeys PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:50:48.206 --> 02:50:59.599]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:51:00.159 --> 02:51:07.007]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:51:07.427 --> 02:51:09.510]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:51:10.030 --> 02:51:14.994]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:51:22.640 --> 02:51:23.561]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:51:30.726 --> 02:51:39.590]  You are sick because you allow yourself to remain sick and you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw food.
[02:51:39.770 --> 02:51:41.131]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[02:51:41.291 --> 02:51:45.293]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[02:51:45.473 --> 02:51:51.276]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[02:51:51.816 --> 02:51:54.057]  The two most complete protein superfoods known.
[02:51:54.417 --> 02:51:56.877]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water.
[02:51:57.197 --> 02:52:04.359]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you to homeostasis.
[02:52:04.639 --> 02:52:08.319]  It's also very hydrating and, more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[02:52:08.599 --> 02:52:11.180]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:16.381]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.
[02:52:16.681 --> 02:52:18.222]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:52:18.422 --> 02:52:19.982]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:42.757 --> 02:52:44.938]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:52:44.958 --> 02:52:47.399]  We're here live and, of course, back from 9 to midnight Central.
[02:52:47.439 --> 02:52:48.160]  Be sure and join us.
[02:52:48.180 --> 02:52:53.502]  Tell your friends and family and neighbors about the show, whether you listen on shortwave, internet, satellite, or AM or FM.
[02:52:54.563 --> 02:52:57.304]  Before I get into some final news tidbits, there's quite a few here.
[02:52:57.344 --> 02:52:59.645]  I'll have to shotgun it out, blitzkrieg it out.
[02:53:00.925 --> 02:53:04.247]  Matrix of Evil, my new film, with Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney.
[02:53:05.067 --> 02:53:07.929]  Some of my best speeches and confrontations with a deputy U.S.
[02:53:07.969 --> 02:53:08.389]  attorney.
[02:53:09.676 --> 02:53:13.339]  Colonel Craig Roberts, Frank Morales, the film covers it all.
[02:53:13.479 --> 02:53:15.341]  In a minute we're going to play this clip.
[02:53:15.742 --> 02:53:21.327]  Listen to Ron Paul, after I talk about the Illuminati, talk about how those in Washington believe in world government.
[02:53:22.408 --> 02:53:26.953]  The film is just full of this stuff, but here's just a minute from the intro.
[02:53:27.473 --> 02:53:28.134]  Go ahead and hit that.
[02:53:30.259 --> 02:53:31.840]  Here is the public plan.
[02:53:31.940 --> 02:53:32.941]  High line.
[02:53:33.001 --> 02:53:34.562]  Connecting us all in by law.
[02:53:34.582 --> 02:53:36.984]  Microchips in our brains by 2025.
[02:53:37.044 --> 02:53:40.926]  We're looking at the literal realization of a military police state in America.
[02:53:41.146 --> 02:53:46.250]  The American people have failed in their oversight of the integrity of our political system.
[02:53:48.056 --> 02:53:54.681]  The final target is the American people.
[02:53:54.701 --> 02:53:58.504]  We need to break that connection between the police and the military.
[02:53:58.744 --> 02:54:01.526]  They're charging for weapons of mass destruction because they have marijuana.
[02:54:01.826 --> 02:54:05.209]  I support the Constitution, which would be at odds with my own party.
[02:54:05.709 --> 02:54:07.230]  There really is an Illuminati.
[02:54:07.270 --> 02:54:09.032]  There really are 13 families.
[02:54:09.532 --> 02:54:11.694]  They own the big banks and print the money.
[02:54:12.334 --> 02:54:15.297]  They're in our universities and they're in our Congresses.
[02:54:15.697 --> 02:54:17.699]  And they believe in one world government.
[02:54:18.239 --> 02:54:24.504]  And plunge the American people into the deepest economic abyss of a generation.
[02:54:25.064 --> 02:54:31.610]  If we have, or when we have another attack, it looks like they'll come with more legislation.
[02:54:32.865 --> 02:54:35.190]  Again, problem, reaction, solution.
[02:54:35.330 --> 02:54:41.681]  Over and over again, government uses crises to scare the population into submission.
[02:54:41.842 --> 02:54:43.505]  That is so important to understand.
[02:54:45.609 --> 02:54:46.310]  All right, folks.
[02:54:46.390 --> 02:54:50.034]  Toll-free number to get Matrix of Evil or Police State 3 or the new book, Order Out of Chaos.
[02:54:50.074 --> 02:54:52.796]  Big discounts when you get multiple items.

[02:54:57.461 --> 02:54:58.482]  Perfect Christmas gift.
[02:54:58.863 --> 02:54:59.904]  Perfect birthday present.
[02:55:00.404 --> 02:55:02.306]  Give it to your local talk show host, your pastor.
[02:55:02.326 --> 02:55:02.386]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:07.552 --> 02:55:18.922]  Or InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:55:21.664 --> 02:55:25.407]  Final news, oil baron's detention prompts KGB fears.
[02:55:26.748 --> 02:55:33.554]  London Telegraph, the arrest of Russia's richest man has prompted warnings from politicians and commentators that President Vladimir Putin
[02:55:34.677 --> 02:55:38.921]  Old comrades in the KGB are staging a creeping takeover of the Kremlin.
[02:55:39.361 --> 02:55:43.245]  Of course, the guy they arrested had been outspoken and kind of had some libertarian ideas.
[02:55:43.805 --> 02:55:45.047]  A lot of this has been happening.
[02:55:45.647 --> 02:55:47.889]  A nine-year-old arrested for waving toy gun.
[02:55:47.909 --> 02:55:50.692]  And this is out of the Morning Journal, out of Lauren.
[02:55:51.112 --> 02:55:59.820]  A nine-year-old boy was arrested at gunpoint in handcuffs Saturday because he was waving a toy gun over his head while seated on a bench outside a store, according to a Lorien police report.
[02:56:00.260 --> 02:56:00.741]  His mother...
[02:56:01.634 --> 02:56:01.814]  Ms.
[02:56:01.854 --> 02:56:05.637]  Sanders of Sheffield Lakes and her son Thomas Clark Jr.
[02:56:05.677 --> 02:56:09.941]  told Lorien Police when they approached him, the Broadway business, that the gun was a toy.
[02:56:09.961 --> 02:56:18.127]  An officer aimed his weapon at the boy's head, ordered him to be handcuffed, and arrested him for juvenile delinquency by reason of inducing panic.
[02:56:18.568 --> 02:56:28.876]  Sanders, 28, was also charged with obstruction of justice and resisting arrest when she pleaded with police, verbally, folks, not to arrest her son and to give him a warning, according to a police report.
[02:56:29.528 --> 02:56:30.870]  Stop a cop with an arrest.
[02:56:31.391 --> 02:56:35.255]  A nine-year-old while his mom's in a story playing with a toy gun.
[02:56:35.316 --> 02:56:36.557]  It's just psychopaths.
[02:56:37.558 --> 02:56:39.321]  Another article up in upstate New York.
[02:56:39.681 --> 02:56:42.505]  Village bans paintball BB pellet guns.
[02:56:43.987 --> 02:56:44.607]  Too dangerous.
[02:56:45.127 --> 02:56:48.128]  World Bank to back controversial Caspian pipeline.
[02:56:48.568 --> 02:56:54.770]  London Guardian, a controversial scheme led by oil giant BP, built a huge, strategically important pipeline.
[02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:58.331]  It's about to win critical backing, according to a leaked document.
[02:56:58.691 --> 02:57:11.774]  Despite widespread criticism, the World Bank is due to approve a meeting tomorrow of the £250 million or £149 million loan to a consortium to build a pipeline from Baca to Azerbaijan to the Caspian Sea of the Turkish port of
[02:57:13.052 --> 02:57:14.933]  Again, that's what that's all about, folks.
[02:57:15.354 --> 02:57:15.994]  We're out of time.
[02:57:16.034 --> 02:57:17.635]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:57:17.675 --> 02:57:18.736]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:57:18.776 --> 02:57:19.457]  Be sure and join us.
