[00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:06.767]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:33.599]  All right, folks.
[00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:34.599]  It's Sam Hain.
[00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:37.700]  It's your favorite satanic holiday.
[00:00:57.438 --> 00:01:09.467]  And we'll be talking about that in about 40 minutes with the author of a book I read a couple years ago, and I heard him on Dave and Joyce's show this morning, so I'm having him up, Lou White, and it's Fossilized Customs.
[00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:13.609]  And everything in the book is in the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.571]  Again, this stuff's hidden in plain view.
[00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:24.277]  It's like Coca-Cola being called Coke, and you tell somebody that it used to have cocaine in it, and that's why it's called that, or that Coke is the biggest...
[00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:25.526]  I think.
[00:01:48.862 --> 00:02:02.025]  With the Gauls in France or the Visigoths in Germany or the Druids in England, ancient England, they all celebrate the Day of the Dead on November 1st and, of course, have ceremonies the night before.
[00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:03.226]  That's today.
[00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:05.606]  Mexico has their Day of the Dead.
[00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:15.849]  All of it's the same because it all goes according to the heavens, according to the stars, according to sun worship, or then what you know of as the worship of Lucifer or the light bearer.
[00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:19.516]  It's just historical facts, so we'll explore that.
[00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:25.000]  In the meantime, a ton of absolutely vital news and information.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.602]  Barbara Bush threatens presidential candidates.
[00:02:28.702 --> 00:02:30.283]  Now, I was emailed this.
[00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:33.645]  I went to the CNN transcript section of Larry King Live.
[00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:35.026]  This happened last week.
[00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:46.993]  And she said, Barbara Bush said, quote, you can criticize me, but don't criticize my children, and don't criticize my daughters-in-law, and don't criticize my husband, or you're dead, close quote.
[00:02:48.763 --> 00:03:01.143]  Now, if you or I said that about presidential candidates or anyone, we would get a visit from the police of the Secret Service, but not when the mother of the president, the wife of the former CIA director, UN ambassador, Chinese ambassador...
[00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:05.953]  And, of course, former president, so pretty scary stuff.
[00:03:05.973 --> 00:03:06.853]  We'll go over that.
[00:03:07.473 --> 00:03:08.093]  Also, U.S.
[00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:13.795]  develops lethal new viruses that kill everyone that comes in contact with it.
[00:03:14.635 --> 00:03:15.295]  100% kill rate.
[00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:20.016]  We covered this two years ago when the scientists over in Australia developed it.
[00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:29.398]  They published online in a major journal how to make a mutated virus that will kill all of the mammals of any species.
[00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:30.525]  I think.
[00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:30.726]  I think.
[00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:49.086]  We're good to go.
[00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:15.118]  That's mainstream news.
[00:04:44.953 --> 00:04:52.079]  Also, again, the history of Halloween from CNN, Halloween and Ungodly Import, and a lot more coming up.
[00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:53.420]  I haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.584]  Big show lined up for you in the next three hours.
[00:04:59.605 --> 00:05:01.586]  And I'm, again, Alex Jones, your host.
[00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:05.810]  The websites are prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.970]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:11.014 --> 00:05:13.896]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:14.668 --> 00:05:15.269]  We're good to go.
[00:05:31.988 --> 00:05:33.049]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:51.420]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[00:06:05.385 --> 00:06:06.905]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:09.106]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:10.687]  Oh, my God!
[00:06:10.948 --> 00:06:15.670]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.571]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:21.993]  This is Pat Cooper.
[00:06:22.013 --> 00:06:24.454]  Tony DelVecchio is coming to this station very soon.
[00:06:24.514 --> 00:06:26.455]  I book any day now.
[00:06:26.935 --> 00:06:27.835]  You're going to love his show.
[00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:34.698]  That's all about this with your host, Tony DelVecchio, Saturday evenings from 9 to 10 p.m.
[00:06:34.738 --> 00:06:37.980]  Central Time, right here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.380]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:47.544]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.705]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[00:06:50.905 --> 00:06:56.548]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[00:06:56.808 --> 00:07:00.830]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.713]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[00:07:09.502 --> 00:07:10.102]  Hello, folks.
[00:07:10.122 --> 00:07:11.102]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:07:11.482 --> 00:07:17.224]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:17.464 --> 00:07:22.605]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:22.945 --> 00:07:32.247]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:07:32.587 --> 00:07:37.508]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:07:37.848 --> 00:07:41.870]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.872]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:07:47.192 --> 00:07:53.094]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:07:53.434 --> 00:08:02.478]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:08:02.658 --> 00:08:06.180]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.841]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:10.462 --> 00:08:12.663]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:13.224 --> 00:08:16.005]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:29.178]  All right, my friends, it is Samhain, Samhain.
[00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:39.965]  It is the high holy day from the Aztec kingdom to Babylon, where children were sacrificed to the sun god, going into the winter.
[00:08:41.218 --> 00:08:48.925]  And that goes back over six-plus thousand years of human history, and here we are celebrating it in plain view right in front of everyone.
[00:08:49.045 --> 00:09:01.397]  And so, you know, you may go out and celebrate Halloween, but at least you need to know about the real culture, what we face, and how this has been inculcated into the body mindset.
[00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:04.700]  And we're coming up in about...
[00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:06.779]  32 minutes.
[00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:09.501]  We're going to be joined by Lou White.
[00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:11.122]  A couple of years ago, I read his book.
[00:09:11.162 --> 00:09:16.727]  It's about 100 pages long, short little booklet, but it's full of powerful info that you can basically find in the encyclopedia.
[00:09:17.127 --> 00:09:18.348]  This is all mainstream stuff.
[00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:19.289]  This is just the history.
[00:09:19.729 --> 00:09:20.790]  None of this is debatable.
[00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.973]  And we'll talk about fossilized customs.
[00:09:25.573 --> 00:09:27.275]  That's his book.
[00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:29.697]  And it's very, very interesting.
[00:09:29.717 --> 00:09:31.318]  You know, last Halloween, I had on...
[00:09:32.168 --> 00:09:36.072]  I'm an Associated Press writer who wrote about, well, yeah, the Christian right-wingers are right.
[00:09:36.873 --> 00:09:45.421]  Halloween really was where they sacrificed children in bonfires, bone fires, in England and Scotland and Ireland going back thousands of years ago, as well as in Europe.
[00:09:45.822 --> 00:09:53.950]  But you find the same thing going on, again, in the Aztec kingdoms, the Mayan kingdoms, the Babylonian and the Egyptians to some extent.
[00:09:55.254 --> 00:09:57.154]  And this is just the history, folks.
[00:09:57.574 --> 00:10:00.335]  And again, those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:05.196]  And you look at the trappings and the rituals that are done on what you call Halloween.
[00:10:05.216 --> 00:10:08.116]  And it is very, very serious.
[00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:10.577]  Okay, let me launch straight into the news.
[00:10:10.597 --> 00:10:12.837]  We've got a bunch of biological weapons news for you.
[00:10:12.857 --> 00:10:15.378]  A bunch of police state developments.
[00:10:15.478 --> 00:10:18.198]  But first off, I got an email.
[00:10:19.178 --> 00:10:21.039]  And I had trouble believing it.
[00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:23.039]  So I went to Larry King Live at CNN.
[00:10:24.304 --> 00:10:33.271]  And I went to the transcript from October 22nd to last week where Barbara Bush said, if you criticize my family, quote, you're dead.
[00:10:35.053 --> 00:10:38.095]  Now, look, I take this very, very seriously.
[00:10:38.515 --> 00:10:47.903]  About two years ago, three years ago, when George Bush was first president, even before 9-11, somebody sent me an email threatening the president's life.
[00:10:48.487 --> 00:10:49.909]  And I figured it was a setup.
[00:10:50.209 --> 00:10:51.591]  The email was sent to a bunch of people.
[00:10:52.032 --> 00:10:53.273]  Well, I called the Secret Service.
[00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:54.535]  This was in Tennessee.
[00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:55.697]  It was written up in the newspapers.
[00:10:56.317 --> 00:10:58.821]  And they went and arrested the guy, and it turned out he was mentally ill.
[00:10:59.522 --> 00:11:01.725]  And that was in the paper, and the Secret Service thanked me.
[00:11:02.617 --> 00:11:03.518]  So I'm on the record.
[00:11:03.598 --> 00:11:09.121]  I wish no harm upon the puppet president or Bill Clinton or Al Gore or George Bush or Wesley Clark.
[00:11:09.561 --> 00:11:12.884]  I wish that they would be tried for treason, of course.
[00:11:13.644 --> 00:11:24.151]  I wish that they would be indicted for their crimes, for the insider trading and the bid rigging and the supercomputers to China and the nuclear missile systems and all of it.
[00:11:24.191 --> 00:11:30.274]  I wish Bill Clinton would be indicted for pardon gate and the horrible things he did, pardoning convicted money launderers and drug dealers.
[00:11:30.795 --> 00:11:30.975]  But
[00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:36.885]  I know that nonviolence is the way to go in educating people and beating back this new world order.
[00:11:38.325 --> 00:11:59.032]  So I take it very, very serious when a very powerful woman, married to the former CIA director, former president, has a son who is the president, the most powerful puppet on earth, that is on the surface the most powerful human on earth, he has the nuclear launch codes, everything, to say that if you criticize my family, you're dead.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.142]  Now, that's her quote, and we take it very serious.
[00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:10.264]  Our headline, Barbara Bush threatens Democratic presidential candidates, which have Secret Service protection.
[00:12:10.945 --> 00:12:13.066]  Barbara Bush, you can't criticize me.
[00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:22.030]  She says, you can criticize me, but don't criticize my children, and don't criticize my daughters-in-law, and don't criticize my husband or your dad.
[00:12:24.151 --> 00:12:27.092]  Now, this was set on national TV, and you can go watch it.
[00:12:27.232 --> 00:12:29.533]  They have video of it, too, there on the site, not just the transcript.
[00:12:30.345 --> 00:12:35.368]  And there are links to this stuff on Infowars.com being updated right now.
[00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:36.148]  I believe it's already up.
[00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:38.529]  And it's serious business.
[00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:40.210]  They'll say, oh, she was just joking.
[00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.491]  Well, if you were right at that, they'd be at our door, folks.
[00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:44.512]  And they should be.
[00:12:45.412 --> 00:12:46.133]  They should be.
[00:12:46.893 --> 00:12:47.653]  I'm on the record.
[00:12:47.693 --> 00:12:50.695]  You threaten the president to me, I'm going to call the Secret Service on you.
[00:12:51.295 --> 00:12:53.656]  Because I know there's a bunch of provocateurs out there, number one.
[00:12:53.676 --> 00:12:55.377]  I'm not going to be part of this stuff.
[00:12:56.758 --> 00:12:57.038]  Okay?
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.601]  And I take this very, very, very serious.
[00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.722]  I'm tempted to call the Secret Service myself.
[00:13:04.262 --> 00:13:05.302]  And it's scary, too.
[00:13:05.362 --> 00:13:15.846]  I mean, I don't want to have the eye of Soron, you know, looking at me, although I already know it's gazed down at me from its pyramid quite a few times.
[00:13:16.326 --> 00:13:16.986]  Now, that's admitted.
[00:13:17.026 --> 00:13:19.147]  Bush has known who I am for eight years.
[00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:26.709]  The guy's admitted that in front of about 100 news cameras when he had me arrested for asking about the CFR and Trilateral Commission and Federal Reserve.
[00:13:27.498 --> 00:13:30.240]  That's, of course, in the new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:13:30.941 --> 00:13:39.767]  But he turned to Bill Graham and said, that's Alex Jones, that's the guy who was sort of, quote, whispering into his ear, according to the Round Rock newspaper and the Straitsman who ran stories on it.
[00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:43.810]  So, you know, I've had the burning eye look at me quite a few times.
[00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.892]  I frankly think we're doing more good just exposing the system.
[00:13:46.932 --> 00:13:55.359]  I don't like the eye looking at me, but... I mean, they're certainly aware of what she did, and nothing's going to happen to her, so don't waste your time calling the Secret Service.
[00:13:55.479 --> 00:13:55.719]  I just...
[00:13:56.838 --> 00:13:59.580]  National TV, you criticize my family, you're dead.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.722]  I mean, that's real nice, Barbara.
[00:14:02.463 --> 00:14:04.324]  That's real friendly of you.
[00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:08.648]  And this just shows their sick, sick mindset.
[00:14:09.528 --> 00:14:10.829]  You say, oh, well, it's just a joke.
[00:14:10.929 --> 00:14:12.571]  No, it's not a joke, okay?
[00:14:13.411 --> 00:14:14.993]  Okay, it's not funny.
[00:14:16.033 --> 00:14:22.879]  And no matter how much we probably dislike the Democratic presidential candidates, I dislike George W. Bush, too.
[00:14:23.419 --> 00:14:25.281]  We shouldn't shoot our mouths off like that.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.401]  And it's, again, it's not funny.
[00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:29.541]  Not funny at all.
[00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:31.021]  Okay.
[00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:34.762]  Let's get into the really important news here.
[00:14:34.782 --> 00:14:36.303]  This is out of the New Scientist.
[00:14:37.163 --> 00:14:44.225]  I heard Jeremy Floyd covering this article yesterday, and I called in the show about it because he was reading the article, and it's where the U.S.
[00:14:44.265 --> 00:14:45.946]  government claims they developed this.
[00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:46.706]  No, they didn't.
[00:14:47.529 --> 00:15:08.543]  Two years ago, more than two years ago, remember all the mousepox stories out of Australia and all their papers where they put the recipe out, the specific genome of how to mutate a smallpox, mousepox, cowpox, whatever virus for any mammal, into something that kills 100% of those that are given it, even when they're given antiviral medications and other stuff.
[00:15:09.403 --> 00:15:09.664]  U.S.
[00:15:09.704 --> 00:15:12.385]  develops lethal new viruses, new scientists.
[00:15:12.405 --> 00:15:14.607]  This is one of the headlines on Infowars.com.
[00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.616]  A site that's funded by the U.S.
[00:15:16.636 --> 00:15:23.098]  government has deliberately created an extremely deadly form of mousepox, a relative of the smallpox virus.
[00:15:23.718 --> 00:15:32.681]  Through genetic engineering, the new virus kills all mice, even if they have been given antiviral drugs as well as a vaccine that would normally protect them.
[00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.870]  The work has not stopped there.
[00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:39.892]  The cowpox virus, which infects a range of animals, including humans, has been genetically altered in a similar way.
[00:15:39.952 --> 00:15:44.593]  The new virus, which is about to be tested on animals, should be lethal only to mice.
[00:15:44.733 --> 00:15:46.653]  Mark Buller, the University of St.
[00:15:46.673 --> 00:15:48.133]  Louis, told the new scientist.
[00:15:48.494 --> 00:15:52.094]  He says his work is necessary to explore what bioterrorists might do.
[00:15:52.114 --> 00:15:54.515]  Yeah, go ahead and publish the way to do it, too.
[00:15:54.535 --> 00:15:55.075]  That's real good.
[00:15:55.315 --> 00:15:57.596]  Now they have plausible deniability when the globalists release it.
[00:15:57.796 --> 00:15:58.736]  They get total tyranny in.
[00:15:59.372 --> 00:16:08.705]  But the research brings closer the prospect of pox viruses that cause only mild infections in humans being turned into diseases lethal enough to people who have been vaccinated.
[00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:12.229]  Again, turn into viruses lethal even to people who have been vaccinated.
[00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.854]  They vaccinate the mice, give them this stuff, and it kills 100% of them.
[00:16:16.135 --> 00:16:16.876]  Same thing with cows.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.281]  We're good to go.
[00:16:37.032 --> 00:16:48.538]  I have great concern about what's going on in this pox virus that can cross species, said Ian Ramshaw of the Australian National University in Cambridge on being told of Butler's work.
[00:16:48.658 --> 00:16:58.923]  Ramshaw was a member of the team that accidentally discovered how to make mouse pox more deadly, but the modified mouse pox his team created was not as deadly as Buller's.
[00:16:59.023 --> 00:17:00.744]  Funny, two years ago it said it killed all the mice.
[00:17:01.704 --> 00:17:02.605]  No rebound.
[00:17:02.745 --> 00:17:13.097]  Since then, Ramshaw told the new scientist his team has also created more deadly forms of mousepox and has used the same method to engineer a more deadly rabbit pox virus.
[00:17:13.137 --> 00:17:18.063]  But this research revealed that the modified pox virus are not contagious, he says.
[00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.266]  This is good news in the sense that these viruses...
[00:17:20.846 --> 00:17:27.667]  ...could not cause ecological havoc by wiping out a mouse or rabbit populations around the world if they escape the lab.
[00:17:28.287 --> 00:17:45.391]  Now remember, the Level 4 Bioweapons Lab at Porton Down, where Dr. David Kelly was the head and now dead, of course, along with dozens of other of these top guys, they, quote, accidentally released weaponized foot and mouth three years ago, and we have mainstream news articles on that at InfoWars.
[00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:47.531]  Just accidentally released it, they said.
[00:17:48.487 --> 00:17:49.168]  And it goes on and on.
[00:17:49.428 --> 00:17:51.589]  Another one here out of Gainesville Sun.
[00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.452]  Vaccine evading mousepox virus created.
[00:17:54.472 --> 00:18:03.198]  Research team backed by a federal grant has created a genetically engineered mousepox virus designed to evade vaccines, highlighting the deadly potential of biological and bioterrorism.
[00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:06.060]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.501]  And it gets even worse, folks.
[00:18:08.082 --> 00:18:11.064]  Lethal viruses from 1918 genetically reconstructed.
[00:18:11.084 --> 00:18:11.744]  U.S.
[00:18:11.784 --> 00:18:15.647]  Army scientists create Spanish flu virus in laboratory medical benefit.
[00:18:15.947 --> 00:18:16.568]  Questionable.
[00:18:16.908 --> 00:18:17.929]  Sunshine Project.
[00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:29.746]  And about two and a half years ago, they went up near the North Pole to a whaling village where there were dead British and Russian sailors.
[00:18:30.367 --> 00:18:33.409]  They dug up a fat guy who still had not decomposed.
[00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:42.177]  They said he was a 280-pound man and said that that had kept him contained and got live virus out of his lungs.
[00:18:43.271 --> 00:18:45.391]  And so now they've got it.
[00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:48.672]  And, of course, it will accidentally be given to the next dictator on the list.
[00:18:50.412 --> 00:18:56.994]  And it says the Spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 to 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction.
[00:18:57.034 --> 00:19:03.315]  Several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1980 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains.
[00:19:03.615 --> 00:19:09.036]  These proved to be lethal for mice, while virus constructs with the genes from the current flu virus types are different.
[00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:09.959]  We're good to go.
[00:19:39.662 --> 00:19:43.044]  Protective measures, especially against the bioterrorist attack with the flu virus.
[00:19:43.504 --> 00:19:45.505]  But you look at the globalists, they have the history.
[00:19:45.845 --> 00:19:58.812]  And the PNAC documents of 2000 written by Dick Cheney and Wolfowitz and others, particular white paper rebuilding America's defenses, says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons to kill certain races.
[00:19:59.852 --> 00:20:01.633]  That's mainstream news, by the way.
[00:20:02.314 --> 00:20:05.275]  From the PNAC website, you might want to read it in horror.
[00:20:06.576 --> 00:20:07.616]  They want to get rid of 80 to 95 percent of us.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:16.425]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:20:16.866 --> 00:20:24.632]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:30.577]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:20:30.857 --> 00:20:31.817]  We're good to go.
[00:20:58.244 --> 00:20:58.504]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[00:21:10.666 --> 00:21:11.026]  We're good to go.

[00:22:02.244 --> 00:22:03.687]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.354]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who's a pharmacist from Marks Puzzle Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:22:14.494 --> 00:22:15.675]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:16.416]  Thank you, Marvin.
[00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:19.879]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[00:22:20.059 --> 00:22:20.560]  Is that true?
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:21.761]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[00:22:21.801 --> 00:22:24.704]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[00:22:24.764 --> 00:22:25.004]  price.
[00:22:25.224 --> 00:22:27.226]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[00:22:27.286 --> 00:22:27.987]  They're very common.
[00:22:28.107 --> 00:22:31.210]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.470]  price.
[00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.891]  Now, what about Tamoxifen?
[00:22:32.911 --> 00:22:35.272]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[00:22:35.492 --> 00:22:39.194]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against a regular U.S.
[00:22:39.214 --> 00:22:39.475]  price.
[00:22:39.855 --> 00:22:42.196]  Now, are these brand-name products made by the same companies?
[00:22:42.476 --> 00:22:44.418]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[00:22:44.458 --> 00:22:46.499]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[00:22:46.719 --> 00:22:51.522]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.

[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.401]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[00:24:08.162 --> 00:24:16.188]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:16.868 --> 00:24:19.210]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:20.231 --> 00:24:29.698]  You know, I can't stress the magnitude of the articles I just read from the New Scientist, the Sunshine Project,
[00:24:31.087 --> 00:24:32.448]  The Gainesville Sun.
[00:24:33.309 --> 00:24:35.230]  They're all on Infowars.com.
[00:24:36.011 --> 00:24:48.701]  The government's got all these giant labs, according to the Baltimore Sun, creating hundreds of gallons of liquid death, weaponized smallpox, weaponized Ebola, weaponized anthrax.
[00:24:48.761 --> 00:24:50.703]  And then the weaponized anthrax with the U.S.
[00:24:51.543 --> 00:24:57.488]  patented process shows up at the Capitol so the Patriot Act could get passed in all the bedlam.
[00:24:58.792 --> 00:25:05.813]  And the globalists say we're going to get hit by biologicals, we're all going to be in walled-off cities, thumb-scanning, face-scanning to do anything to leave our homes.
[00:25:06.193 --> 00:25:08.354]  This is how they're going to re-engineer our society.
[00:25:08.614 --> 00:25:17.476]  Their own papers say they're going to use this to annihilate their enemies, to take over the planet, and to scare the yuppie-eyed world into total submission.
[00:25:18.416 --> 00:25:23.097]  The PNAC document, Rebuilding America's Defenses of 2000, in September of 2000,
[00:25:24.611 --> 00:25:34.978]  And this paper, on their own website, was written by Dick Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz, says we must legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:25:35.378 --> 00:25:41.742]  Do you understand that everything they talk about in those PNAC documents they've carried out, folks?
[00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:46.760]  From the time it was formed in 97 right through to 2001.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.521]  Do you understand how serious, how scary this is?
[00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:53.062]  We've got to expose these people.
[00:25:53.082 --> 00:25:55.342]  But the average person goes, that's ridiculous.
[00:25:55.362 --> 00:25:56.623]  There's no such thing.
[00:25:56.643 --> 00:25:57.403]  And then you show it to them.
[00:25:57.443 --> 00:26:00.384]  Well, I guess we need to kill certain races.
[00:26:01.544 --> 00:26:03.765]  I guess you're anti-Semitic if you don't want to kill.
[00:26:04.405 --> 00:26:08.206]  You don't like black people because you're against having weapons that will kill all the black people.
[00:26:09.907 --> 00:26:11.207]  I mean, that's really the mindset.
[00:26:11.227 --> 00:26:12.168]  You're against Arnold.
[00:26:12.188 --> 00:26:13.048]  You're a racist.
[00:26:15.242 --> 00:26:15.742]  We've heard it.
[00:26:15.782 --> 00:26:16.703]  We've seen it in the news.
[00:26:16.723 --> 00:26:18.104]  You criticize the government.
[00:26:18.124 --> 00:26:19.184]  That's code.
[00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:22.526]  That's code for racism.
[00:26:22.806 --> 00:26:24.467]  You're against killing certain races.
[00:26:24.507 --> 00:26:25.528]  You're a racist.
[00:26:27.229 --> 00:26:28.730]  Let me get into the global government news.
[00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:29.210]  Look at this.
[00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.011]  This is out of the international news.
[00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:36.305]  And it says, Russia may join NATO to fight common enemy Berlin.
[00:26:36.365 --> 00:26:46.319]  Outgoing NATO Secretary General George Robinson was quoted on Sunday as saying that former enemy Russians could one day join NATO to fight the new common enemy of international terrorism.
[00:26:46.379 --> 00:26:48.001]  And it gets into how that's already happening.
[00:26:48.482 --> 00:26:49.083]  Here's another one.
[00:26:49.883 --> 00:26:55.144]  Out of the day, Navy's top officer calls for a global naval force.
[00:26:55.164 --> 00:26:56.805]  This is the big mainstream Connecticut newspaper.
[00:26:57.125 --> 00:26:59.966]  Clark outlined strategy for combating terrorism.
[00:26:59.986 --> 00:27:11.629]  The Navy's top officer outlined on Monday a strategy for fighting terrorism that calls for an international naval collaboration to share intelligence and resources in an unprecedented show of maritime force.
[00:27:11.729 --> 00:27:16.450]  Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Vern Clark described the proposal as a maritime NORAD mission
[00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:27.033]  In his opening speech at the 16th International Sea Power Symposium, the Naval War College, Clark spoke on the representatives from 75 countries among number 60 Navy and Coast Guard chiefs.
[00:27:27.133 --> 00:27:30.515]  By combining their strategies, he told them, Paris would have no place to hide.
[00:27:30.855 --> 00:27:33.716]  It gets into merging with the EU and its Navy.
[00:27:34.316 --> 00:27:35.596]  Here's a World Net Daily article.
[00:27:35.636 --> 00:27:37.737]  Probably saw it a month ago in the USA Today.
[00:27:37.837 --> 00:27:38.097]  Quote,
[00:27:38.746 --> 00:27:40.187]  Supreme Court follows the U.N.'
[00:27:40.167 --> 00:27:40.688]  's beat.
[00:27:41.108 --> 00:27:42.389]  Here's a new one, O'Connor.
[00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:43.070]  U.S.
[00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.911]  must rely on foreign law.
[00:27:45.472 --> 00:27:51.517]  American courts need to pay more attention to international legal decisions, help create a more favorable impression abroad.
[00:27:51.777 --> 00:27:56.381]  Oh, yes, where there's no juries, can't face your accuser, there's no free speech, no Second Amendment.
[00:27:56.741 --> 00:27:59.043]  Yes, yes, that's exactly what America's all about.
[00:27:59.564 --> 00:28:00.104]  Said U.S.
[00:28:00.144 --> 00:28:03.727]  Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor at an awards dinner in Atlanta.
[00:28:03.847 --> 00:28:05.889]  The impressions we create in the world are important...
[00:28:06.582 --> 00:28:07.743]  And they leave them marks.
[00:28:07.803 --> 00:28:09.665]  We need to follow the precedent of foreign courts.
[00:28:10.126 --> 00:28:20.616]  O'Connor said, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the 73-year-old justice said some of her high court colleagues have made similar appeals to foreign law, not only in speeches but in interviews, but in some of their legal opinions.
[00:28:20.957 --> 00:28:27.083]  Her most recent public remarks came at a dinner Tuesday sponsored by the Atlanta-based Southern Center for International Studies.
[00:28:28.829 --> 00:28:37.534]  And it says the American judicial system generally gives a favorable impression worldwide, but when it comes to the impression created by treatment of foreign international law, the United States court jury is still out.
[00:28:37.894 --> 00:28:41.777]  So we've got to be good and give up our republic and follow it.
[00:28:41.837 --> 00:28:44.678]  Folks, did you know if you speak out against the EU, you can be arrested?
[00:28:45.439 --> 00:28:45.959]  Pipe that in.
[00:28:46.019 --> 00:28:48.220]  Minister of Arrest, if you speak out against the EU, it'll pop up.
[00:28:48.881 --> 00:28:56.085]  Did you know if you say basically anything, there's no juries, no facing your accusers, the EU can hold you for 30 years without a trial.
[00:28:57.401 --> 00:28:59.021]  Article 29 and 30 of the U.N.
[00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:01.962]  Declaration of Human Rights says you have no rights whenever the U.N.
[00:29:02.002 --> 00:29:02.702]  feels like it.
[00:29:03.262 --> 00:29:04.442]  But she says we need to follow that.
[00:29:04.803 --> 00:29:06.223]  Oh, we're not in a new world order.
[00:29:06.363 --> 00:29:07.423]  Certainly not.
[00:29:07.463 --> 00:29:10.844]  There's no such thing as the global taxes they're publicly calling for.
[00:29:10.864 --> 00:29:12.144]  The U.N.
[00:29:12.204 --> 00:29:14.385]  and Unidear didn't say they want to take all our guns.
[00:29:14.425 --> 00:29:15.205]  Well, yes, they did.
[00:29:16.245 --> 00:29:24.447]  But still, Rush Limbaugh, while he's gobbling hillbilly heroin, says that if you say there's a world government, you're a conspiracy kook.
[00:29:24.587 --> 00:29:26.287]  It doesn't exist.
[00:29:27.469 --> 00:29:32.752]  A New World Order doesn't exist when he's got a New World Order publisher run by the CFR.
[00:29:34.413 --> 00:29:35.593]  And George Bush is good.
[00:29:37.635 --> 00:29:39.355]  So, that's just some of what's coming up.
[00:29:39.415 --> 00:29:44.278]  We've got the real history of Halloween and other big holidays coming up.
[00:29:44.398 --> 00:29:46.179]  It's painful news, but you need to hear it.
[00:29:46.879 --> 00:29:51.962]  And just, folks, the stack's about five inches thick today, and every story is as powerful as the ones I just covered.
[00:29:52.142 --> 00:29:53.243]  We're going to cover it all.
[00:29:53.943 --> 00:29:55.224]  We're going to cover it all when we get back.
[00:29:56.047 --> 00:29:57.590]  And we're going to take calls, so stay with us.
[00:30:00.416 --> 00:30:01.337]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.818 --> 00:30:03.421]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.363 --> 00:30:07.068]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.299 --> 00:30:12.280]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.020]  Hello, folks.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:23.062]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:30:23.443 --> 00:30:27.964]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:30:28.024 --> 00:30:39.367]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste, and odors are separated from the water.
[00:30:39.967 --> 00:30:46.809]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:30:47.209 --> 00:30:49.350]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:54.812]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:30:55.112 --> 00:31:01.234]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803.
[00:31:02.934 --> 00:31:05.677]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:06.718]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:12.396]  I really needed to lose weight.
[00:31:12.436 --> 00:31:14.038]  I was tired, lethargic.
[00:31:14.238 --> 00:31:19.061]  So far, using the collagenate, I've lost 46 pounds.
[00:31:19.081 --> 00:31:21.703]  46 pounds with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:31:22.103 --> 00:31:23.805]  Bernadine, tell me about those inches.
[00:31:24.145 --> 00:31:27.567]  Inches off my chest, my waist, my hips, my thighs.
[00:31:27.868 --> 00:31:31.350]  I was at about a 20, pushing into a size 22.
[00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.371]  I'm down to a size 14.
[00:31:33.772 --> 00:31:35.533]  People have been telling me I look younger.
[00:31:35.993 --> 00:31:39.516]  I've lost 46 pounds with collagenate.
[00:31:39.816 --> 00:31:42.298]  It's just one of the best investments I've ever made.
[00:31:42.518 --> 00:31:48.603]  I am so glad that Bernadine took my advice to lose weight the safe and healthy way with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:31:48.843 --> 00:31:52.466]  That was Bernadine's personal experience, and it can be yours next.
[00:31:52.526 --> 00:31:53.387]  What are you waiting for?
[00:31:53.707 --> 00:31:54.928]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:31:54.968 --> 00:31:55.189]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:31:55.249 --> 00:31:56.650]  And get $25 off a three-month supply of collagenate.
[00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.370]  Call now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:31:57.671 --> 00:31:57.931]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.541]  T-H-I-N Oh my God!
[00:32:12.821 --> 00:32:17.543]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:32:17.823 --> 00:32:18.483]  Yes, it's true.
[00:32:18.583 --> 00:32:21.264]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:32:21.404 --> 00:32:25.426]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:32:25.546 --> 00:32:26.106]  You heard it right.
[00:32:26.266 --> 00:32:31.288]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:32:31.408 --> 00:32:31.848]  We're good to go.
[00:32:49.482 --> 00:32:50.763]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[00:32:50.783 --> 00:32:50.844]  1-800-615-7094
[00:33:16.753 --> 00:33:22.937]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest, a gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:33:23.037 --> 00:33:24.538]  All right, my friends, we're back live.
[00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:27.139]  It is Sam Hain, your favorite satanic holiday.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.821]  Coming up in about ten minutes, we're going to talk to Lou White.
[00:33:30.841 --> 00:33:38.146]  A couple of years ago, I read his great book, Fossilized Customs, and everything he talks about is found in your Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:33:38.926 --> 00:33:40.107]  I want you to understand that.
[00:33:41.172 --> 00:33:48.717]  Halloween is a human sacrifice holiday from Babylon to Germany to Wales to southern Mexico.
[00:33:49.158 --> 00:33:51.259]  And all over the world, it's the Day of the Dead.
[00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:52.860]  They even have a holiday in Japan.
[00:33:53.221 --> 00:33:55.102]  This is the Day of the Ghost and the Demons.
[00:33:55.662 --> 00:33:56.743]  I wonder why that is.
[00:33:56.783 --> 00:34:01.346]  Well, it's in your encyclopedia, and we're about knowing the history of things.
[00:34:01.787 --> 00:34:03.348]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:34:03.728 --> 00:34:06.250]  That's coming up in about ten minutes, and we'll be with this for about an hour.
[00:34:07.054 --> 00:34:13.560]  I already went into bioweapons the government's developing that will kill certain races of people and how they're digging up the Spanish flu and reengineering it.
[00:34:14.141 --> 00:34:18.525]  And when that killed over 30 million people, the news says 20 to 40 million.
[00:34:18.545 --> 00:34:20.787]  The numbers I have are about 34, 35 million.
[00:34:21.908 --> 00:34:27.994]  We'll get into more on that, more on Barbara Bush saying on Larry King Live, if you criticize my family, quote,
[00:34:28.857 --> 00:34:30.058]  You are dead.
[00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:35.582]  And we take this very, very serious for the presidential candidates that she was threatening.
[00:34:36.223 --> 00:34:40.866]  They can say it's a joke, but if you or I did it, we'd have the Secret Service knocking at our door.
[00:34:42.888 --> 00:34:47.952]  Before we go to Jim Shepard, who's going to be with us for about five minutes, because yesterday we were having some phone problems.
[00:34:48.692 --> 00:34:53.116]  Before we do that, I appreciate him coming back on, I do want to tell you that my new film,
[00:34:54.406 --> 00:34:56.027]  Matrix of Evil is out.
[00:34:56.107 --> 00:34:57.207]  It's over two hours long.
[00:34:57.227 --> 00:35:02.450]  It has Congressman Ron Paul in it talking about world government, world oppression, who runs Washington, the New World Order.
[00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:05.271]  Three excerpts of my best speeches.
[00:35:05.311 --> 00:35:07.412]  The Austin City Council throwing out the Patriot Act.
[00:35:07.452 --> 00:35:08.592]  That's probably my best speech ever.
[00:35:09.673 --> 00:35:13.654]  It's got Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney talking about UN-run white slavery rings.
[00:35:15.095 --> 00:35:16.136]  Government-sponsored terror.
[00:35:16.176 --> 00:35:19.277]  Government-sponsored assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King.
[00:35:19.969 --> 00:35:21.310]  Just a bunch of other key subjects.
[00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.393]  Colonel Craig Roberts, and no introduction needed for this show.
[00:35:25.193 --> 00:35:26.995]  Frank Morales, police state expert.
[00:35:27.635 --> 00:35:32.359]  It's a very good film, full of news clips, documents, you name it.
[00:35:32.479 --> 00:35:33.079]  It's $25.95.
[00:35:33.179 --> 00:35:35.161]  Order three or more of any of my ten films.
[00:35:35.181 --> 00:35:36.482]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:35:36.882 --> 00:35:39.965]  I published the new book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsor Terror in the New World Order, 1995.
[00:35:40.425 --> 00:35:41.186]  Get a second copy for $11.95.
[00:35:43.047 --> 00:35:50.415]  Your purchase also supports this show, what we're doing, and you're authorized to make copies of my films for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:35:50.756 --> 00:35:54.700]  So please get them, and they make great gifts to wake people up.
[00:35:55.381 --> 00:35:56.622]  Call toll-free, folks.
[00:35:56.642 --> 00:35:56.682]  1-888-
[00:35:58.524 --> 00:35:58.684]  253-3139.
[00:35:58.704 --> 00:35:59.565]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:59.585 --> 00:36:03.508]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:17.980]  Or Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.860]  The new film, Matrix of Evil, is out.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:26.522]  If you haven't gotten Road to Terror into your police state through your Masters of Terror or Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, get those two, folks.
[00:36:26.842 --> 00:36:30.363]  They're really waking people up and having a big effect, and I want to thank those that have gotten them.
[00:36:30.703 --> 00:36:32.203]  Your purchase makes this show possible.
[00:36:33.284 --> 00:36:41.026]  Now, yesterday, we had Jim Shepard on for a few minutes, and there was some technical stuff on the network, so we're going to have him back here for about five minutes.
[00:36:41.066 --> 00:36:42.146]  And, Jim, thanks for doing that.
[00:36:43.374 --> 00:36:44.916]  Oh, it's always a pleasure, Alex.
[00:36:44.956 --> 00:36:50.040]  Yeah, yesterday was kind of, I couldn't tell if I was being heard or I was hearing a lot of grinding in the background.
[00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:54.224]  Well, you're awesome, and that's, you know, once in a blue moon, but Jim, thanks for coming back on.
[00:36:54.244 --> 00:37:00.150]  The reason, you're in Colorado, and it said that most of your creeks and streams and lakes
[00:37:00.876 --> 00:37:07.478]  But including the Boulder Creek feeding the water supply called Boulder Creek and Boulder is full of everything you can imagine.
[00:37:07.498 --> 00:37:10.019]  You know, it's full of Prozac.
[00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:11.159]  It's full of birth control.
[00:37:11.219 --> 00:37:12.139]  It's full of hormones.
[00:37:12.179 --> 00:37:13.240]  It's full of cleaning agents.
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.060]  This is what we've been telling people.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.621]  This is nationwide.
[00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:21.382]  Folks, you have absolutely got to get these high-quality water filters.
[00:37:21.402 --> 00:37:23.923]  And if you've already got them, buy them for family as a gift.
[00:37:23.963 --> 00:37:24.503]  Go ahead, Jim.
[00:37:25.344 --> 00:37:31.940]  Well, you know, Alex, a lot of people have very different water filtration systems, and they're really not sure how efficient they are.
[00:37:32.803 --> 00:37:46.130]  And what we want to do is introduce a test that everybody can do at home if you've got a water filtration system or if you have a gravity filter that you previously bought and you've been considering upgrading that to the... From somebody else where it's made in India.
[00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:52.433]  Yeah, and you've considered upgrading that to the purifiers, but you're just not quite sure.
[00:37:52.773 --> 00:37:55.075]  We have a little test that you can run at home.
[00:37:55.095 --> 00:37:59.797]  It's a very easy little test, and it'll really tell you how efficient your water filtration system is.
[00:38:00.521 --> 00:38:07.892]  And that is simply to, if you've got a gravity filter, add a teaspoon of red food coloring to the water.
[00:38:07.932 --> 00:38:08.993]  It'll turn it very dark red.
[00:38:10.064 --> 00:38:13.985]  And see how efficient it is at removing that red food coloring.
[00:38:14.345 --> 00:38:18.566]  And that food coloring is probably not good for you, but it's not bad for you.
[00:38:19.746 --> 00:38:22.107]  So it's a test that's safe you can do.
[00:38:22.127 --> 00:38:24.048]  Jim, you've done these tests.
[00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:26.928]  Most major brands, red comes right off the other end.
[00:38:27.068 --> 00:38:27.969]  That's exactly right.
[00:38:27.989 --> 00:38:35.090]  Just probably 95% to 99% of them, it's going to come through without even diminishing the color of it.
[00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:37.331]  Some of them are going to take a little bit of it out.
[00:38:37.891 --> 00:38:42.294]  The black Berkey purification elements will eliminate the food coloring entirely.
[00:38:42.734 --> 00:38:43.255]  You won't see it.
[00:38:43.295 --> 00:38:44.936]  It'll come out crystal clear.
[00:38:44.996 --> 00:38:51.240]  Now, you've had big scientific tests done by major universities, but this is something everybody can do for themselves.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.001]  That's right.
[00:38:52.181 --> 00:39:05.530]  And so if you've got another gravity filtration system and you want to test those filter elements, go through this test, and that'll tell you visually the efficiency of the filtration.
[00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:18.980]  If you've got some of these other filters that you hook onto the sink, well, put a little bit of, put about a teaspoon of red food coloring down the little stem, you know, just take it off, pour it down in there, hook it back up, and see what comes out.
[00:39:19.081 --> 00:39:20.722]  And that'll tell you how efficient it is.
[00:39:21.522 --> 00:39:30.091]  But the Black Berkey filter elements, when the laboratories tested them, they told us, frankly, that we have set a whole new standard in water filtration.
[00:39:30.391 --> 00:39:36.017]  It just... Bacteria does not get... Pathogenic bacteria just does not get through the filters.
[00:39:37.118 --> 00:39:39.280]  We reduce chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:39:40.101 --> 00:39:41.082]  And so...
[00:39:43.764 --> 00:39:55.546]  I would urge everybody who is considering doing that to do that today because our special on the Black Berkey filter elements is going to end today.
[00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:56.707]  Today is the last day.
[00:39:57.287 --> 00:40:09.129]  And that is if you buy four Black Berkey purification elements at the retail price, you get a free $50 shower filter to get those chemicals out of your shower so you don't breathe them in, or a sport Berkey.
[00:40:10.163 --> 00:40:15.927]  And we have another special up that ends today, and you can get that special on Infowars.com.
[00:40:16.427 --> 00:40:19.789]  And just click on the picture of the Berkey light, and that will bring you right to the specials.
[00:40:20.669 --> 00:40:31.497]  Absolutely, and again, if you just want sport burpees to give to the grandchildren or your neighbors, or for when you go to a restaurant and don't want to drink the garbage, you can put your ice water right in there.
[00:40:31.517 --> 00:40:39.743]  It works great, comes out quick, and doesn't reduce things totally like the big, high-quality black burpees, but gets a lot of it out.
[00:40:40.123 --> 00:40:49.990]  This is a big way to take control of your life, folks, and it's a big way to support this show and our international shortwave outreach, and Jim is the sole supporter of that, does an unbelievable job.
[00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:57.374]  And give Debbie Morrow a call right now, 1-888-803-4438.
[00:40:58.334 --> 00:41:04.178]  Go out to the store, buy a dollar bottle of red food coloring, and go put it in your filter and see what happens, okay?
[00:41:04.238 --> 00:41:06.099]  And then do it with a BlackBerry when you get it, and you'll find out.
[00:41:06.119 --> 00:41:06.699]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:41:06.759 --> 00:41:10.221]  I bought these systems from Jim four years ago.
[00:41:13.943 --> 00:41:20.229]  Okay, he now makes a system that's even better, before he was the top of the standard, made in America, per your request.
[00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:22.051]  Not in England.
[00:41:22.071 --> 00:41:25.415]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:41:26.576 --> 00:41:27.957]  Jim, you live in Colorado.
[00:41:28.418 --> 00:41:34.484]  No, actually, Alex, I live in Texas, but we do have a Colorado distribution center that I'm at frequently.
[00:41:34.604 --> 00:41:36.546]  Well, I know whenever I talk to you, you're in Colorado, so...
[00:41:38.436 --> 00:41:41.360]  But, Jim, you're in Colorado, though.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.301]  How many days a week?
[00:41:43.122 --> 00:41:46.747]  Well, it really depends on where the emergencies are at.
[00:41:46.767 --> 00:41:50.091]  So I'm back and forth, but currently I am talking to you from Colorado.
[00:41:50.151 --> 00:41:51.273]  And, you know, you mentioned about...
[00:41:51.966 --> 00:41:56.628]  You know, in Colorado, we've had outbreaks of Giardia that have come through the municipal systems.
[00:41:57.409 --> 00:41:59.910]  And, of course, they don't discover it until people start getting sick.
[00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:01.791]  And then they think, oh, my gosh, you know, what's wrong?
[00:42:01.831 --> 00:42:03.631]  And they find out that it's coming through the municipal.
[00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:07.753]  Four or five times a year in Austin, they tell everybody to boil the water because the sewage spills over.
[00:42:07.993 --> 00:42:09.394]  Folks, just stop drinking the trash.
[00:42:09.814 --> 00:42:12.335]  It was in your Denver Post how infested your lakes are.
[00:42:13.056 --> 00:42:17.538]  The same thing just came out in Dallas with the Prozac in the water at high levels.
[00:42:18.879 --> 00:42:19.080]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.504]  Thank you for coming on the show, Jim.
[00:42:22.584 --> 00:42:23.265]  Always a pleasure.
[00:42:23.285 --> 00:42:24.287]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[00:42:24.467 --> 00:42:25.288]  You bet, my friend.
[00:42:25.769 --> 00:42:27.371]  Do we have our next guest on?
[00:42:28.574 --> 00:42:31.455]  We do have Lou White and Fossilized Customs.
[00:42:31.576 --> 00:42:37.158]  I was at an expo about two years ago in Dallas and bought one of his books.
[00:42:37.698 --> 00:42:38.338]  I think it was like $10.
[00:42:39.459 --> 00:42:40.519]  They're offering them here today.
[00:42:40.539 --> 00:42:41.700]  I'm not selling them, folks.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.161]  I'm just telling you you should get them for, what, $7.95.
[00:42:44.861 --> 00:42:48.023]  It's a great little booklet full of photos and diagrams.
[00:42:48.483 --> 00:42:50.024]  I dug around this morning trying to find mine.
[00:42:50.044 --> 00:42:51.404]  When I decided to have him on, I couldn't find it.
[00:42:51.444 --> 00:42:52.945]  It was about 100 pages long from memory.
[00:42:54.106 --> 00:42:56.528]  But again, everything that's in it is in the history books.
[00:42:56.948 --> 00:42:58.249]  It's in the encyclopedia.
[00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.850]  It's just condensed down here.
[00:43:00.111 --> 00:43:01.492]  This is all fact.
[00:43:02.572 --> 00:43:04.514]  Now your interpretation of it can be different.
[00:43:05.255 --> 00:43:09.318]  And frankly, folks, I celebrate Christmas even though I know it's not the date Christ was born.
[00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:11.560]  We know that happened in the early summer.
[00:43:12.641 --> 00:43:15.063]  But I think about Jesus Christ on Christmas.
[00:43:15.103 --> 00:43:17.885]  And yeah, I give people presents just because I love my family.
[00:43:18.265 --> 00:43:20.187]  But the point is you need to be conscious of that.
[00:43:21.408 --> 00:43:22.929]  And if you are a Christian or if you're
[00:43:23.692 --> 00:43:25.393]  Whatever you are, you should know what you're doing.
[00:43:40.118 --> 00:43:40.799]  I think we're good to go.
[00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:58.376]  And this is the reality, folks.
[00:43:58.436 --> 00:44:07.080]  And so we're going to talk about the history of what modern Christmas is and what Halloween is and how the pagan systems have taken these days back over.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:13.963]  Because to begin with, the Christian church came in and took over the holidays, replaced it with saints, trying to suppress it.
[00:44:14.403 --> 00:44:20.406]  It came back, obviously, and now the roots of what are at the heart of it have now manifested themselves mainstream.
[00:44:21.115 --> 00:44:21.356]  Hello, Alex.
[00:44:35.632 --> 00:44:40.777]  Well, I started out just like everybody else, and I asked questions when I was maybe starting at about nine years old.
[00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:59.533]  I continue to ask questions from my educators, and they didn't know much about anything, really.
[00:45:00.393 --> 00:45:11.500]  They may have known about the subject they taught, but I had to find all the information out through personal research, and of course, that'll turn you into a freak, because if you want to be right, don't expect anything but loneliness.
[00:45:12.455 --> 00:45:18.279]  But anyway, I grew up, and by the time I was 18, I started to get too busy to worry about things.
[00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:24.222]  I'm 53 now, but when I was about 35, I had a little time to do more research.
[00:45:24.743 --> 00:45:34.248]  Of course, all that time I was studying science and the various disciplines of what they understood to be evolution, and I didn't get what they were saying because it didn't go anywhere.
[00:45:34.889 --> 00:45:38.191]  I thought there were some things to be discovered, so I...
[00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:41.532]  Looked to the scriptures for the very first time in my life.
[00:45:41.632 --> 00:45:43.753]  I sat down and I started to read them.
[00:45:44.073 --> 00:45:46.854]  And I understood what it was saying, you know.
[00:45:47.574 --> 00:45:50.275]  Well, it talks about how don't worship the evergreen tree.
[00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:54.377]  It talks about, you know, all of this is in there.
[00:45:54.597 --> 00:45:55.657]  Yeah, it is.
[00:45:55.857 --> 00:46:03.260]  And from the Aztecs to the Romans, they had their Day of the Dead on the 31st and November 1st.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.361]  Now, that is in the encyclopedia, by the way.
[00:46:05.601 --> 00:46:05.801]  Yeah.
[00:46:07.563 --> 00:46:08.164]  They sure did.
[00:46:08.224 --> 00:46:09.364]  And it's all over the world.
[00:46:09.444 --> 00:46:10.525]  It's in all the cultures.
[00:46:10.565 --> 00:46:13.808]  And, of course, these things are laid there as snares for us.
[00:46:14.368 --> 00:46:15.329]  They look beautiful.
[00:46:15.709 --> 00:46:25.236]  There's a way that seems right, but in fact, behind it, if you just pick up and look behind the false stage, you'll find out the origin of these things.
[00:46:25.336 --> 00:46:26.978]  And they are abominations.
[00:46:27.018 --> 00:46:30.720]  Now, I remember being on the radio eight years ago, and I'd never seen news articles about this.
[00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:31.781]  Here's today.
[00:46:31.881 --> 00:46:34.183]  CNN, Halloween, and Ungodly Impored.
[00:46:35.624 --> 00:46:37.185]  Here's Salt Lake City Tribune.
[00:46:37.586 --> 00:46:39.687]  Church presents a hell of a Halloween.
[00:46:40.267 --> 00:46:40.827]  Here's another one.
[00:46:40.867 --> 00:46:41.828]  Halloween alternative.
[00:46:42.188 --> 00:46:43.109]  Dilute the real thing.
[00:46:43.289 --> 00:46:43.709]  Fun.
[00:46:44.409 --> 00:46:46.370]  Christians just saying no to Halloween.
[00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:47.331]  Herald Tribune.
[00:46:47.351 --> 00:46:48.411]  American Daily.
[00:46:48.452 --> 00:46:50.393]  Don't let your kids celebrate a religion of evil.
[00:46:51.153 --> 00:46:55.415]  We've got a whole stack of news here mainstream talking about what Halloween really is.
[00:46:55.615 --> 00:46:59.838]  Yeah, and Deuteronomy isn't just talking to the Jews or even Israel.
[00:47:00.278 --> 00:47:01.819]  It's talking to all mankind.
[00:47:02.259 --> 00:47:07.364]  We're not to learn the patterns or way that they worship their deities, the pagan deities.
[00:47:07.664 --> 00:47:10.867]  We're not to learn their ways nor worship them in their way.
[00:47:11.548 --> 00:47:13.970]  Now, I heard you this morning on David Joyce's show.
[00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:17.213]  You talked about, and I had lots of Bible study, folks, what it says.
[00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:19.055]  Abraham left...
[00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.550]  The corrupt cities.
[00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:23.051]  He was the first guy.
[00:47:23.091 --> 00:47:33.133]  The whole world was into the occult to leave and to not follow a man and the witch doctors and to develop what then grew into the Ten Commandments.
[00:47:34.233 --> 00:47:34.793]  Idolatry.
[00:47:34.833 --> 00:47:36.854]  Yeah, he was called out of Ur of the Chaldeans.
[00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:39.234]  He was himself a Chaldean, you know.
[00:47:40.594 --> 00:47:41.775]  But Abraham is the first.
[00:47:42.355 --> 00:47:46.056]  He's called the father of our faith and his name means the father of nations.
[00:47:46.516 --> 00:47:47.596]  Not just Israel, but
[00:47:48.248 --> 00:47:54.892]  The nations, and it's too small a thing for our Savior to just, you know, be Savior for Israel.
[00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:56.874]  But, you know, to the ends of the earth.
[00:47:57.134 --> 00:48:02.297]  Okay, let's go over Halloween first, or Samhain, or... Right.
[00:48:04.919 --> 00:48:06.100]  Let's go over the history of that.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:14.205]  Yeah, of course this goes all the way back to Babylon, but picking it up recently, it comes from the Druids directly into this English...
[00:48:15.083 --> 00:48:15.624]  We're good to go.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.362]  I think so.
[00:48:52.632 --> 00:48:54.794]  And that's a name given to it by the Christians.
[00:48:55.054 --> 00:48:56.595]  Or Samhain or Samhain.
[00:48:56.775 --> 00:48:58.597]  They called it Samhain.
[00:48:59.097 --> 00:49:11.466]  But November 1st was actually All Saints Day to the Catholics, and they made it that date because of Samhain, to crust it over, to conceal it.
[00:49:11.606 --> 00:49:12.767]  To enculturate it.
[00:49:13.168 --> 00:49:15.469]  Right, and assimilate that pagan behavior.
[00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:21.654]  But they wanted to reinvent it so that they could keep their market share of the pagans.
[00:49:22.655 --> 00:49:26.657]  And they embraced it and sanctified it by making it All Saints Day.
[00:49:27.037 --> 00:49:38.845]  And the evening before All Saints Day, or November 1st, was what we call October 31st, and that's called All Hallowed Even, which means the evening of All Saints Day.
[00:49:40.374 --> 00:49:41.836]  Now, we see this time and time again.
[00:49:41.896 --> 00:49:58.715]  In fact, in Europe, when bombs would fall in France or England or Germany on the big cathedrals, they would find archaeological records of altars and things under it, and they admit that all the big cathedrals, including some of the newer Protestant ones, would be built on Druid sites.
[00:49:59.705 --> 00:50:05.091]  Yeah, the Druids and the previous Mithrists had indoor altars.
[00:50:05.772 --> 00:50:09.055]  An altar indoor is unknown in the Scriptures.
[00:50:09.095 --> 00:50:14.521]  The Scripture shows us that the altar for sacrifices was outside the house
[00:50:15.189 --> 00:50:17.651]  And it was actually an unclean place.
[00:50:17.731 --> 00:50:20.133]  Either by a river or on a hilltop.
[00:50:20.273 --> 00:50:21.754]  Yeah, they brought these altars.
[00:50:22.314 --> 00:50:22.554]  Right.
[00:50:23.215 --> 00:50:34.463]  But these pagan religions brought these altars indoors, and they would shape these altars as human autopsy tables because they slaughtered people on them.
[00:50:34.683 --> 00:50:37.245]  Just like Chocmul in Mexico.
[00:50:38.105 --> 00:50:38.386]  Yeah.
[00:50:38.506 --> 00:50:39.466]  At Chichen Itza.
[00:50:39.927 --> 00:50:40.127]  Yeah.
[00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:41.491]  And I've been there.
[00:50:42.332 --> 00:50:43.353]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:50:43.693 --> 00:50:46.554]  And folks, I have all the National Geographic's going back like 20 years.
[00:50:46.915 --> 00:50:52.998]  I have four or five issues where they dig up all the bodies in the peat bogs or find the bone yards where they would burn them year after year.
[00:50:54.039 --> 00:51:04.305]  And then you look at satanic books today, which I've read, and you're describing how to sacrifice a child, and it's the same thing that they did then, what to do with the ashes and the oil of the child afterwards.
[00:51:04.865 --> 00:51:05.785]  This is your Halloween.
[00:51:05.806 --> 00:51:08.227]  We're going to talk about what's fact when we get back.
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.340]  We're good to go.
[00:51:32.411 --> 00:51:38.915]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:44.198]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:51:44.298 --> 00:51:53.204]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:51:53.464 --> 00:52:00.729]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at triple 8
[00:52:03.713 --> 00:52:05.235]  Call now and get free shipping.
[00:52:05.496 --> 00:52:05.836]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:10.077 --> 00:52:12.498]  We hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[00:52:12.598 --> 00:52:13.079]  Pollution.
[00:52:13.119 --> 00:52:13.399]  Pollen.
[00:52:13.439 --> 00:52:14.559]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:52:14.619 --> 00:52:15.039]  Allergies.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:15.460]  Asthma.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.080]  Probably not.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:16.940]  Well, listen to this.
[00:52:17.161 --> 00:52:26.145]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[00:52:26.225 --> 00:52:27.046]  Six to ten times?
[00:52:27.086 --> 00:52:28.126]  How could that be, you ask?
[00:52:28.226 --> 00:52:28.486]  Worse.
[00:52:28.586 --> 00:52:29.907]  Think about what's inside your home.
[00:52:30.067 --> 00:52:30.747]  Hairspray.
[00:52:30.847 --> 00:52:31.348]  Chemicals.
[00:52:31.488 --> 00:52:32.308]  Does anyone smoke?
[00:52:32.348 --> 00:52:32.588]  Fumes.
[00:52:32.748 --> 00:52:34.449]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:52:34.889 --> 00:52:36.450]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:37.231]  Toxic fumes.
[00:52:37.271 --> 00:52:38.271]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[00:52:38.311 --> 00:52:39.752]  Oh, Rod, you're so full of curtains.
[00:52:40.132 --> 00:52:40.653]  Into you.
[00:52:40.893 --> 00:52:41.693]  Into your children.
[00:52:41.734 --> 00:52:42.274]  Their lungs.
[00:52:42.354 --> 00:52:43.135]  Am I scaring you?
[00:52:43.475 --> 00:52:44.376]  Remember this word.
[00:52:44.776 --> 00:52:45.517]  Puritech.
[00:52:45.537 --> 00:52:47.078]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[00:52:47.138 --> 00:52:49.320]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:53:02.030]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:03.391]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:03.471]  888-491-4100.
[00:53:03.531 --> 00:53:04.552]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[00:53:04.672 --> 00:53:05.373]  Online at Puritech.com.
[00:53:10.657 --> 00:53:11.258]  We're good to go.
[00:53:26.595 --> 00:53:30.817]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:53:30.877 --> 00:53:37.820]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.981]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:43.402]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[00:53:43.562 --> 00:53:50.667]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:53:50.948 --> 00:53:56.292]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:53:56.832 --> 00:53:59.474]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:53:59.574 --> 00:54:00.735]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:54:00.755 --> 00:54:01.215]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:54:01.295 --> 00:54:02.996]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:54:16.706 --> 00:54:23.392]  In 1981, when the Israelis attacked the nuclear reactor in Iraq, it was called TAMUS.
[00:54:25.494 --> 00:54:31.179]  And TAMUS, again, one of the root words for the deity of the evergreen tree.
[00:54:33.601 --> 00:54:34.582]  Again, this stuff's everywhere.
[00:54:34.602 --> 00:54:39.306]  We're just trying to get you to start thinking about history, what's behind the curtain.
[00:54:39.887 --> 00:54:42.269]  As Lou White was just saying, author of an amazing book,
[00:54:43.658 --> 00:54:44.879]  Fossilized Customs.
[00:54:44.959 --> 00:54:46.120]  We'll tell you how to get that in the next hour.
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.401]  I know we already have a bunch of callers.
[00:54:47.841 --> 00:54:53.905]  We're going to go over some more history of this for another 15, 20 minutes, and we'll take calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:54.366 --> 00:54:57.288]  I'm not saying you're an evil devil worshiper if you celebrate Christmas.
[00:54:58.088 --> 00:54:58.468]  Okay?
[00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:01.450]  We're just saying that's not the real date of Christ's birth.
[00:55:01.691 --> 00:55:02.491]  It's in the summer.
[00:55:03.952 --> 00:55:12.058]  We're not saying you're a devil worshiper if you give kids candy, but the point is you are carrying out a ritual of giving offerings of the priest by their law
[00:55:13.053 --> 00:55:23.420]  And the jack-o'-lantern is, again, where they would burn the fatty candle made up of the children that were burned at the stake, basically.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:27.123]  And then you see again in the Inquisition that being carried on.
[00:55:27.924 --> 00:55:31.626]  All of this has always been with us, and it's worldwide.
[00:55:31.646 --> 00:55:33.187]  It's according to the sun, the stars.
[00:55:33.467 --> 00:55:41.353]  That's why, whether it's the Aztecs or the Japanese or the Mayans or the Druids, it's the same garbage, the same behavior, almost completely identical.
[00:55:42.116 --> 00:55:42.456]  I think so.
[00:55:42.496 --> 00:55:42.716]  I think so.
[00:56:07.126 --> 00:56:20.896]  And again, Lou, you were talking on David Joyce's show about offerings to the sun god, how they would tie yellow ribbons around their house, around the oak tree, which was the druid main god.
[00:56:21.316 --> 00:56:25.919]  Please don't take my child, and now we put yellow ribbons around our trees for the troops.
[00:56:26.179 --> 00:56:27.340]  Go over some more of that history.
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:36.868]  Well, the oak tree roots all the way back to these gardens or whatever, and these areas where the pagans would go in.
[00:56:37.209 --> 00:56:41.372]  You'll read the book of Jeremiah, chapter 10, and it'll talk about this a little bit.
[00:56:41.652 --> 00:56:52.262]  And the groves, they would go into the groves and hang gifts on a tree, and that tree was actually thought to be Nimrod, a real man who was slain by, they say, Shem.
[00:56:52.922 --> 00:56:53.362]  I think so.
[00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:22.897]  And you wouldn't be able to find anybody openly worshipping the sun necessarily from time to time.
[00:57:22.917 --> 00:57:25.419]  And their symbol is the swastika.
[00:57:26.019 --> 00:57:28.001]  That's one of them, yeah.
[00:57:28.141 --> 00:57:32.385]  The Egyptian ankh, the symbol of life, which was a reference to the sun.
[00:57:33.969 --> 00:57:48.042]  Yeah, there were many of those, but the tree of the Druids that we inherited our Christmas tree from because Boniface, during the 8th century, convinced them that they should change from the oak tree to the evergreen tree because it was always green.
[00:57:48.302 --> 00:57:52.926]  And that was the Babylonian gods, so we see the Germanic peoples being given the Babylonian system.
[00:57:53.226 --> 00:57:53.706]  Exactly.
[00:57:53.807 --> 00:58:15.763]  So they just basically camouflaged it, revised it, and kept doing that, and kept this thing occulted, so that the occult actually was embraced into Christianity by means of this evergreen tree being the revision of this oak tree, which was ultimately going back to, you know, the Egyptians used the palm tree, of course.
[00:58:15.923 --> 00:58:18.105]  And what is tying the yellow ribbon around the tree?
[00:58:18.545 --> 00:58:19.726]  Yeah, that was the prayer to the...
[00:58:22.921 --> 00:58:25.062]  We lost his call.
[00:58:25.382 --> 00:58:27.423]  Well, we'll have to get him back on, won't we?
[00:58:28.263 --> 00:58:30.764]  We'll break and start the second hour.
[00:58:31.964 --> 00:58:35.145]  And we'll get our guest back on, and we'll take your calls.
[00:58:35.365 --> 00:58:36.346]  Lou White's our guest.
[00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:37.406]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:37.426 --> 00:58:40.327]  And the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:40.347 --> 00:58:41.848]  And my new film is out, The Matrix of Evil.
[00:58:46.229 --> 00:58:46.889]  It's very interesting.
[00:58:46.909 --> 00:58:48.410]  You might want to go to Infowars.com.
[00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:49.210]  Watch the trailer there.
[00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:53.091]  But the second and third hours are coming up, and he'll be with us through the entire next hour.
[00:58:53.572 --> 00:58:58.833]  Then in the third hour, I'll get back into the modern news and what's going on with the police state and bioweapons and much more.
[00:59:00.854 --> 00:59:11.438]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available in nature.

[00:59:29.077 --> 00:59:30.198]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:30.838 --> 00:59:31.639]  You want answers?
[00:59:32.419 --> 00:59:33.300]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.684]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:38.164 --> 00:59:42.208]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:44.355 --> 00:59:48.997]  Alright folks, we're already into Hour 2.
[00:59:49.037 --> 00:59:51.398]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:51.958 --> 00:59:58.400]  We're talking to Lou White, who's written a great book I read about two years ago, Fossilized Customs.
[00:59:59.421 --> 01:00:01.241]  We're talking about Halloween Samhain.
[01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:03.062]  Samhain is the proper name.
[01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.095]  And I've talked about this many times.
[01:00:07.135 --> 01:00:08.276]  This is what the New World Order is.
[01:00:08.336 --> 01:00:09.197]  It's mind control.
[01:00:10.318 --> 01:00:20.426]  Even if you don't believe in God, believe in Christ Yahweh, you still need to understand, even if you're an atheist, that the globalists are into the occult.
[01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:21.687]  We're good to go.
[01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:49.035]  We've talked about, and it's important to understand, that the witch doctors knew the cycles, when to plant, what to do.
[01:00:49.376 --> 01:00:57.565]  They used that hidden knowledge, as the globalists do today, through ignorance of the population to control them through superstition to scare them into submission.
[01:00:57.685 --> 01:01:04.913]  And as a measure of that control, they would make them give some of their children every year, whether it was Babylon or Tyre with Moloch,
[01:01:06.093 --> 01:01:24.103]  Or the Babylonians or the Druids, to them to be sacrificed, and that's what Samhain or Halloween is, and that's the historical fact, and now the encyclopedia even admits it, but his book, Mr. White's book, even goes into more detail on that.
[01:01:24.183 --> 01:01:29.926]  So, again, just a little bit more on Halloween, what they would do on the eve of November 1st.
[01:01:31.249 --> 01:01:31.589]  Okay.
[01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:34.470]  They would offer gifts.
[01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:37.191]  Each person would put a gift outside their home.
[01:01:37.612 --> 01:01:39.392]  This is where the trick-or-treat thing comes from.
[01:01:39.833 --> 01:01:46.155]  And, of course, it was an offering to the spirits of the dead who were thought to be walking the earth because time stood still.
[01:01:46.795 --> 01:01:52.758]  And the Druids would disguise themselves, and, of course, the people would too, but they mainly stayed indoors.
[01:01:53.178 --> 01:02:00.581]  But the Druids would walk the earth, and the people would look out their windows and see these people, and they couldn't recognize who they were
[01:02:01.241 --> 01:02:14.771]  But the Druids were taking these gifts and offerings, food mostly, and if they didn't really like the offering, they would decide to take that family and have one of their children offered as a human sacrifice.
[01:02:14.891 --> 01:02:24.538]  And the fat from the children, the child was turned into a candle and put into a gourd, and that was put at the door of the home.
[01:02:26.821 --> 01:02:33.168]  And that's exactly what we see is that fossilized custom today hidden in plain view.
[01:02:33.468 --> 01:02:34.770]  It's right out in the open.
[01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:36.652]  But you see, the thing of it is...
[01:02:37.442 --> 01:02:44.506]  As followers of the true Creator, instead of embracing these pagan cultures, we're told to not learn them.
[01:02:44.786 --> 01:02:51.370]  In Deuteronomy 12, we're not to learn how they serve their mighty ones, and we're not to serve Him in their way.
[01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:53.932]  So the one we obey is the one we serve.
[01:02:54.012 --> 01:02:59.635]  I do not celebrate Halloween, and I'm trying to focus on Christ at Christmas.
[01:02:59.695 --> 01:03:01.216]  It's very hard to do, the peer pressure.
[01:03:01.787 --> 01:03:07.690]  Yeah, when we obey a pagan custom, we're obeying that.
[01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:22.477]  Maybe we can think of it as secular, but when we practice something that is an abomination from paganism where formerly pagan deities were worshipped, we're embracing them, and he knows it.
[01:03:22.517 --> 01:03:27.019]  You have to look at it from his heart, not your own, but the one we obey is the one we serve.
[01:03:27.059 --> 01:03:28.420]  So if we're not obeying him,
[01:03:29.304 --> 01:03:35.229]  But we're obeying something else like peer pressure or cultural pressure, something our parents taught us.
[01:03:35.449 --> 01:03:36.771]  We're not really obeying him.
[01:03:36.851 --> 01:03:38.932]  We're obeying something, another process.
[01:03:39.012 --> 01:03:39.933]  And it is ritual.
[01:03:40.033 --> 01:03:42.115]  That's what ritual is, is something that's passed on.
[01:03:42.535 --> 01:03:54.626]  And, you know, there's a scripture that says that in the last days, the Gentiles will actually come before him and say, our fathers have inherited nothing but lies and things of no profit.
[01:03:55.306 --> 01:03:57.208]  And, you know, that's a good thing to know.
[01:03:57.628 --> 01:03:58.209]  Absolutely.
[01:03:58.249 --> 01:03:59.089]  Stay there, Lou White.
[01:03:59.129 --> 01:04:05.395]  We've got calls coming up, and I want to get more into Sam Hain, Salwin, Halloween, and then some of the other holidays.
[01:04:05.795 --> 01:04:08.697]  Ishtar, the rabbit, fertility, eggs.
[01:04:08.737 --> 01:04:12.120]  What does a bunny, rabbit, and eggs have to do with Christ's resurrection?
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.503]  But you notice, see, they've superimposed that over it in plain view.
[01:04:15.523 --> 01:04:16.464]  Go look up Ishtar.
[01:04:16.744 --> 01:04:17.645]  It's a rabbit, folks.
[01:04:17.705 --> 01:04:18.265]  It's eggs.
[01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:19.166]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:21.522 --> 01:04:25.845]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:26.046 --> 01:04:30.449]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:30.629 --> 01:04:35.013]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:04:35.033 --> 01:04:36.374]  The New World Order.
[01:04:37.134 --> 01:04:38.156]  Can emerge.
[01:04:38.176 --> 01:04:42.401]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[01:07:56.562 --> 01:07:57.322]  Black hoods.
[01:07:58.231 --> 01:08:12.894]  When I snuck into Bohemian Grove in mid-summer 2000 and caught world leaders engaged in a satanic ritual, that's been on national TV, by the way, folks, footage I shot globally, they said, yeah, Mr. Jones snuck in and got footage, and yeah, we do a ritual, but it's just for fun.
[01:08:12.934 --> 01:08:14.314]  See, it's all just for fun.
[01:08:14.354 --> 01:08:15.055]  It's occult.
[01:08:15.115 --> 01:08:16.795]  It's hidden in plain view.
[01:08:16.835 --> 01:08:23.936]  That's the New World Order's, one of their favorite tactics, and it's amazing, my friends.
[01:08:23.976 --> 01:08:26.797]  We're talking to Lou White, who's written a very insightful book,
[01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:29.584]  And it's called Fossilized Customs.
[01:08:31.485 --> 01:08:34.906]  Continuing, Lou, with the history of Halloween.
[01:08:35.246 --> 01:08:37.327]  How did Halloween get back into our culture?
[01:08:37.347 --> 01:08:40.049]  I mean, it wasn't back into American culture until, what, the 1950s?
[01:08:42.012 --> 01:08:52.556]  Well, it came over to this country after, well, the original colonies here wouldn't even allow people to celebrate Christmas because they knew what it was.
[01:08:53.316 --> 01:08:58.498]  Anyway, when the Irish came over during the famine that was going on in Ireland back in the 1840s and 1850s,
[01:09:00.746 --> 01:09:01.027]  I think.
[01:09:19.614 --> 01:09:24.015]  You know, embraced and loved, and we taught our children to do it.
[01:09:24.135 --> 01:09:42.461]  Now, before we get 20 calls, Lou, saying you're bashing Catholics, I want to make it clear, folks, that what we're saying is that the Catholic Church was in Rome, and they talked about watch out for false prophets, the Bible says that, and so you had real Christianity there, you had the teachings of Abraham there, and the...
[01:09:44.722 --> 01:09:47.644]  Prophets, people like Moses, that was all there.
[01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:52.707]  But from day one, you've always had the occult trying to get its snout back into things.
[01:09:53.088 --> 01:10:04.415]  And then when the Catholic Church went into the Gauls and the Germans and into the people in England, the Druids, they tried to cover that up by putting saints over it.
[01:10:04.635 --> 01:10:05.155]  It didn't work.
[01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:07.517]  It just crept back in and is now taken totally back over.
[01:10:09.335 --> 01:10:13.577]  So, when did it, but I mean, I had read that it really got popular in the 50s.
[01:10:13.818 --> 01:10:15.419]  How did it grow into what we see today?
[01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:17.920]  Well, it just got bigger and bigger.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:35.930]  I mean, from the 1850s, it just mushroomed slowly up into the second, it takes about 100 years for a custom to really get into full swing, but Santa Claus happened a little quicker, but in the 1930s, he transformed into this full-grown man from a green little elf into
[01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:41.994]  And Coca-Cola promoted that widely with their own colors, you know, the red and white.
[01:10:42.094 --> 01:10:44.915]  And, of course, the Coke bottle shape to his body.
[01:10:45.415 --> 01:10:47.437]  It all changed, you know, rapidly.
[01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:55.281]  But it isn't really anything other than the enculturation and the wide embracing of these other people.
[01:10:55.421 --> 01:10:56.302]  Let's go into that.
[01:10:57.142 --> 01:11:00.084]  Now, again, I've had major publishers on, major authors.
[01:11:00.124 --> 01:11:01.205]  I've read AP articles.
[01:11:01.585 --> 01:11:03.446]  Again, this is in the encyclopedia.
[01:11:04.582 --> 01:11:19.433]  You have these, it was called an English Christmas, and in the 1700s, 1800s, they had to ban it for a while because of riots, deaths, rapes, killings, and their mascot was an evil elf, looked like a gremlin with sharp teeth, Freddy Krueger.
[01:11:19.874 --> 01:11:21.175]  He was called Santa Claus.
[01:11:22.035 --> 01:11:23.476]  And he is Satan.
[01:11:24.557 --> 01:11:28.300]  And then, yeah, Coca-Cola in the 40s and 50s, suddenly it's a guy in a red outfit.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:31.622]  And then people think, oh, no, that's what Santa Claus has looked like forever.
[01:11:32.042 --> 01:11:33.023]  Can you go over that for us?
[01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:36.326]  Yes, it started out like you just described it.
[01:11:36.506 --> 01:11:43.731]  For centuries, this thing was some kind of a druid elf from the forest that had other elves or fauns or friends or whatever.
[01:11:46.073 --> 01:11:49.495]  They believed in a lot of woodland creatures, including satyrs and things.
[01:11:49.935 --> 01:11:50.376]  Anyway, this...
[01:11:51.423 --> 01:12:14.257]  This creature of the Druids was embraced into the religion of Catholicism among the Irish, and they basically, and the Dutch had this myth of some fellow named Nicholas, and when the English people heard the Dutch talking about this fellow called Saint Nicholas, they were saying it in an abrupt way.
[01:12:14.317 --> 01:12:17.939]  They said Saint Nicholas, and they took it down as Santa Claus.
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:19.000]  And
[01:12:20.026 --> 01:12:22.108]  That's where the word comes from.
[01:12:22.268 --> 01:12:26.871]  Now, basically, he was a Grendel-like creature, a larger elf chief demon.
[01:12:27.291 --> 01:12:30.514]  He would come out of the forest in the dark of winter to grab and eat people.
[01:12:31.134 --> 01:12:32.895]  And then now this is our loving Santa Claus.
[01:12:33.976 --> 01:12:35.998]  And, boy, that's interesting.
[01:12:36.198 --> 01:12:37.899]  And, by the way, he would punish good people.
[01:12:38.359 --> 01:12:43.363]  Now they do the inverse of it and say, oh, no, he punishes bad people.
[01:12:43.743 --> 01:12:44.504]  That's right, yes.
[01:12:45.645 --> 01:12:46.886]  And he would reward...
[01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:48.859]  Keep the home fires burning.
[01:12:48.879 --> 01:12:48.959]  Yeah.
[01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:22.534]  So the whole chimney thing was all brought in because that was the most sacred place in the pagan's home.
[01:13:22.554 --> 01:13:25.058]  He would appear in the fire.
[01:13:25.799 --> 01:13:26.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:27.543 --> 01:13:33.827]  Now, going back to Sam Haynes, Sam on Halloween, what would they do to these children?
[01:13:33.847 --> 01:13:43.534]  I mean, again, this is, they found the boneyards, the bonfires, they found the bones, they found thousands of what they call bog people, adults.
[01:13:43.554 --> 01:13:47.416]  They would bash their brains out, slit their throats, and throw them into a peat bog.
[01:13:47.436 --> 01:13:49.037]  But with children, they like to burn them.
[01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:50.278]  Can you go over that for us?
[01:13:50.558 --> 01:13:54.841]  Yes, and this time of year, they had four principal times of the year.
[01:13:54.861 --> 01:13:56.723]  The Illuminati will,
[01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:01.047]  We'll actually continue to do these things out in the open.
[01:14:01.067 --> 01:14:03.851]  Yeah, what is midsummer that the Grove does to Moloch?
[01:14:05.935 --> 01:14:09.859]  That's basically what we're seeing is Moloch worship, yeah.
[01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:13.522]  But, I mean, the global elite celebrate that July 15th.
[01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:14.923]  Any significance to that?
[01:14:15.464 --> 01:14:22.850]  Well, that would probably correspond to at or near the summer solstice when the sun was... That's where we get Father's Day, as a matter of fact.
[01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:33.259]  I mean, in the middle of the summer, when the day is the longest that it'll be and the night's the shortest in the northern hemisphere, this was one of the times of the year when the...
[01:14:34.016 --> 01:14:37.580]  When the pagans would have to demand sacrifice.
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.664]  And by the way, the Hawaiians sacrifice people on these days.
[01:14:41.704 --> 01:14:42.505]  This is global.
[01:14:42.805 --> 01:14:43.365]  Yes, it is.
[01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:46.649]  And it's just done a little bit differently in different places.
[01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:48.210]  But it's all over the earth.
[01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:54.897]  And it's South America, Tahiti, everywhere.
[01:14:55.618 --> 01:14:56.899]  But it all comes from Babylon.
[01:14:58.072 --> 01:15:00.734]  See, Tammuz, again, the name of the nuclear reactor in 81, the Israelis blew up.
[01:15:14.654 --> 01:15:21.256]  Anyway, at this time of year, particularly today, it was All Saints Day tomorrow by the Catholics.
[01:15:22.056 --> 01:15:29.758]  They were covering up the Festival of Samhain by revising it and reinventing it, so they made it All Saints Day.
[01:15:29.778 --> 01:15:31.318]  They're trying to co-opt it, basically.
[01:15:31.518 --> 01:15:33.658]  Yeah, co-opt it or camouflage it.
[01:15:34.399 --> 01:15:37.399]  There's nothing to be feared by looking at the truth, though.
[01:15:37.419 --> 01:15:39.860]  But you see, this stuff is all wrapped up with a lot of emotion.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:46.005]  You know, and so when you reveal the false stage... But it's in the encyclopedia!
[01:15:46.105 --> 01:15:46.946]  Yeah, it is.
[01:15:48.548 --> 01:15:49.829]  I mean, folks, this is 101.
[01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:59.719]  If you read a lot like I do, you see it in your textbook in college, you see pieces of it in National Geographic, you see it in the dictionary.
[01:16:00.519 --> 01:16:05.064]  And when we train our children, see, the thing of it is, the faith of Abraham...
[01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:07.005]  But the occult is always used by the government.
[01:16:07.026 --> 01:16:08.607]  That's right, and also established religions, too.
[01:16:08.627 --> 01:16:09.948]  They brush elbows a lot.
[01:16:09.988 --> 01:16:14.592]  Now, I want to go back to something I heard you talk about on Dave and Joyce's show.
[01:16:14.652 --> 01:16:15.353]  This is important.
[01:16:29.033 --> 01:16:36.736]  Because the globalists are all about secret knowledge to control us that goes back to the witch doctors saying, do what I say or the moon's going to be eaten by the snake tomorrow.
[01:16:36.976 --> 01:16:38.077]  They knew it was an eclipse.
[01:16:38.517 --> 01:16:41.818]  The people would see this, be terrified, follow their orders.
[01:16:41.858 --> 01:16:43.198]  They became the ruling class.
[01:16:43.759 --> 01:16:49.981]  Caesar wrote about this in the Battle for Gaul, what he saw with the Druids and how they terrorized the people and controlled them.
[01:16:51.762 --> 01:16:53.903]  This is ancient mind control, is it not?
[01:16:54.363 --> 01:16:54.863]  Exactly.
[01:16:56.266 --> 01:16:58.708]  It's not any different really right now.
[01:16:59.268 --> 01:17:03.071]  And then it's all excused because it's only for the children.
[01:17:03.111 --> 01:17:06.953]  Well, of course it is because that's the way that enculturation occurs.
[01:17:07.193 --> 01:17:17.240]  For example, when a religion or a state power like Catholicism would move into a new area, they would start working on the children first.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:22.823]  So that when the older people died off, whatever they thought was going on would be forgotten.
[01:17:22.983 --> 01:17:24.704]  We saw this with the Hitler youth.
[01:17:24.764 --> 01:17:26.085]  We see this with the Soviets.
[01:17:26.325 --> 01:17:28.567]  We see this with the CPS, the public schools today.
[01:17:28.667 --> 01:17:30.107]  Yeah.
[01:17:30.147 --> 01:17:32.829]  So it's always constantly under revisionism.
[01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:44.316]  But the religious reasons are all basically overlooked or they're thought to not be important.
[01:17:44.976 --> 01:17:46.137]  But the origins of things
[01:17:47.164 --> 01:17:54.146]  I mean, it's very important, because what it amounts to is, who are we obeying when we practice these things?
[01:17:54.206 --> 01:17:57.966]  Well, let me read from the Herald Tribune, one of the ten biggest papers in England, mainstream.
[01:17:57.986 --> 01:17:58.507]  Mm-hmm.
[01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:16.994]  And then it goes into, for some conservative Christians, this apparent pagan link is reason to denounce modern-day celebration.
[01:18:17.555 --> 01:18:20.897]  But again, it's admitted that they would burn babies in this fire.
[01:18:21.297 --> 01:18:27.561]  And not only that, but they had a lot of other little weird things they did, like the bobbing for apples thing that happens this time of year.
[01:18:28.022 --> 01:18:35.507]  That was actually, they had people that they didn't like, or prisoners or foreigners, actually bob for the apples.
[01:18:36.448 --> 01:18:38.309]  But the thing of it is, the water was boiling.
[01:18:38.949 --> 01:18:50.158]  And they would probably die slowly, but the thing of it is, it would kill all the skin on their face trying to get one of these apples.
[01:18:50.178 --> 01:18:54.281]  They said, if you can get this apple with your teeth, we'll let you go.
[01:18:54.802 --> 01:18:57.123]  Well, they had to go into this boiling water to get it.
[01:18:57.183 --> 01:18:59.065]  That's where the popping for apples came from.
[01:18:59.225 --> 01:19:00.266]  It's all Druid, you know.
[01:19:01.918 --> 01:19:11.962]  It is, folks, and it's in every culture, it's everywhere, and whether it's Protestant or Catholic, you see this stuff, I mean, you see this stuff worldwide.
[01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:14.883]  It's everywhere, and we need to be able to address it.
[01:19:14.903 --> 01:19:20.505]  We're going to come back and cover whatever Mr. White wants to discuss, and we'll go to Howard, Mark, Mike, Joe, and others.
[01:19:20.545 --> 01:19:20.905]  Stay with us.

[01:21:20.982 --> 01:21:27.267]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[01:21:27.648 --> 01:21:31.731]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[01:21:32.232 --> 01:21:39.458]  Only recently has science discovered that maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:57.075]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels, increased libido, which helps prevent impotence, relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort, helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[01:21:57.375 --> 01:22:00.298]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.

[01:23:35.237 --> 01:23:40.078]  Symbol for CBS, Time Warner, Exxon, the Double Cross.
[01:23:40.338 --> 01:23:46.340]  All of it is openly, admittedly, occultic, satanic, ancient.
[01:23:49.521 --> 01:23:53.082]  Mr. White, we're talking to Lou White, author of an amazing book.
[01:23:56.536 --> 01:24:00.202]  We're talking to him about what's just beneath the surface.
[01:24:06.716 --> 01:24:12.401]  Now, openly, it's the fertility god, and again, they've covered up the resurrection of Christ with that.
[01:24:12.982 --> 01:24:24.953]  It's not just that these pagans are out there engaging in their pagan ceremonies publicly and no one even sees it when it's one inch from their face, but on top of it, they love to cover up and move the dates of Christian holidays, don't they?
[01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:25.734]  Yes.
[01:24:25.774 --> 01:24:29.337]  If you look up the word Easter in a Webster's Dictionary,
[01:24:30.351 --> 01:24:34.553]  It'll raise the hair on your skin because it's actually Satan.
[01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:39.514]  He's neither male nor female, but he'll accept worship under any pagan name.
[01:24:40.215 --> 01:24:42.435]  It was Ishtar originally in Babylon.
[01:24:42.475 --> 01:24:47.237]  It mutated to Isis and Astarte, which all means star.
[01:24:47.517 --> 01:24:49.658]  It's stellar worship is what it is.
[01:24:52.339 --> 01:24:56.340]  It was embraced by the Celtic people and the Druids.
[01:24:56.601 --> 01:24:57.781]  These people worshiped
[01:25:00.073 --> 01:25:06.319]  Yeah, it's getting into the worship of the female side.
[01:25:06.399 --> 01:25:12.886]  When I was in the Grove and watching this hour-long satanic ceremony, this has been on Trio Network, BBC, everywhere, folks.
[01:25:13.767 --> 01:25:14.648]  This is mainstream news.
[01:25:14.688 --> 01:25:15.969]  They admit I snuck in and got this footage.
[01:25:15.989 --> 01:25:17.010]  This is where George Bush goes.
[01:25:17.797 --> 01:25:18.477]  It's occult, yes.
[01:25:18.517 --> 01:25:19.497]  That's what it means, hidden.
[01:25:40.225 --> 01:25:47.189]  Under the surface, there's a... I mean, the people that are not initiated can look at it and not know what they're seeing.
[01:25:47.649 --> 01:25:53.452]  But the people that are initiated in it understand what's happening, really, and that's why it's called the occult.
[01:25:53.612 --> 01:26:02.677]  They also said we command through the power of the owl that all the dead who have been a member of this grove over 120-something years, that you be here now.
[01:26:02.757 --> 01:26:04.337]  They also conjured their spirits.
[01:26:04.418 --> 01:26:06.539]  Is that a Christian conservative thing to do?
[01:26:06.759 --> 01:26:08.560]  That's against Isaiah chapter 8 and...
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.701]  Deuteronomy.
[01:26:11.061 --> 01:26:12.442]  You can't contact the dead.
[01:26:12.482 --> 01:26:17.766]  I mean, even Saul, the first king of Israel, went to the witch of Endor.
[01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:22.289]  Wicca is also a Druid thing, but witches have been around since Babylon.
[01:26:22.409 --> 01:26:25.672]  I mean, the first witch was probably Nimrod's wife, Semiramis.
[01:26:26.432 --> 01:26:33.097]  And Saul consulted this witch and really didn't see Samuel.
[01:26:33.277 --> 01:26:35.299]  I mean, that was some demon that he was talking with.
[01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:35.739]  Yeah.
[01:26:36.644 --> 01:26:36.984]  You know.
[01:26:37.444 --> 01:26:38.345]  Unbelievable.
[01:26:38.605 --> 01:26:40.385]  Anything else you want to add before we go to these calls?
[01:26:40.545 --> 01:26:40.786]  Oh, no.
[01:26:40.806 --> 01:26:41.486]  Let's get the calls.
[01:26:41.786 --> 01:26:42.106]  All right.
[01:26:42.166 --> 01:26:44.607]  Howard in Tennessee.
[01:26:44.627 --> 01:26:45.907]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:26:45.947 --> 01:26:46.308]  Go ahead.
[01:26:46.788 --> 01:26:47.488]  No, Alex.
[01:26:47.668 --> 01:26:49.229]  It's Howard from Texas.
[01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:49.669]  Okay.
[01:26:49.749 --> 01:26:49.989]  Fine.
[01:26:50.029 --> 01:26:50.409]  Go ahead.
[01:26:50.669 --> 01:26:52.050]  Oh, hey, Lou White.
[01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:56.231]  You are right about everything, pretty much what you're saying, except for one thing.
[01:26:56.251 --> 01:26:58.472]  Mm-hmm.
[01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:05.935]  The ones who wrote the authorized version, those theologians, they were very much a puritan.
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:07.981]  I don't know.
[01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:26.031]  It doesn't mean it was Chris.
[01:27:26.051 --> 01:27:26.891]  Well, he didn't say that.
[01:27:26.911 --> 01:27:28.412]  He said it's Ishtar, Easter.
[01:27:28.432 --> 01:27:29.232]  It's right there.
[01:27:29.252 --> 01:27:33.875]  Yeah, I know, but I mean, I'm talking about when I heard him on... Oh, on the other show.
[01:27:33.975 --> 01:27:36.856]  On the other show, on Joyce and Dave's show.
[01:27:37.136 --> 01:27:40.238]  Oh, I wasn't contesting the fact that they may have had that intention.
[01:27:40.258 --> 01:27:41.358]  That was what they did.
[01:27:41.378 --> 01:27:42.199]  That's all they did.
[01:27:42.219 --> 01:27:50.263]  Yeah, but I was saying that that was still a very blatant error because the underlying Greek word is pascha.
[01:27:51.759 --> 01:27:53.020]  I know what you're saying.
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:56.822]  Look, folks, bottom line, I don't want to get into a big esoterical debate.
[01:27:56.862 --> 01:28:00.083]  We're here talking about the history of these words.
[01:28:00.123 --> 01:28:02.104]  They admit that Ishtar is Easter.
[01:28:02.705 --> 01:28:05.186]  Oh, I know, Alex.
[01:28:05.206 --> 01:28:07.827]  It's just I was saying it's the transcripts that they have.
[01:28:08.287 --> 01:28:09.047]  That's what they use.
[01:28:09.968 --> 01:28:12.329]  And they've got the transcripts now, and there's
[01:28:13.089 --> 01:28:15.771]  There's been a war going on about that deal.
[01:28:16.611 --> 01:28:23.375]  I'm not here bashing Protestants or Catholics or anybody.
[01:28:24.155 --> 01:28:29.298]  I'm trying to get folks to just think about history, think about words, think about these fossilized customs.
[01:28:29.678 --> 01:28:35.142]  Well, basically what I was saying is the enemy, one thing I agree with you, the enemy likes to revise history.
[01:28:35.462 --> 01:28:41.165]  Either destroy the book's history or change it.
[01:28:42.009 --> 01:28:44.550]  Okay, thank you.
[01:28:44.850 --> 01:28:45.791]  Thank you for the call.
[01:28:45.851 --> 01:28:46.731]  I really appreciate it.
[01:28:47.112 --> 01:28:48.072]  Appreciate that, Howard.
[01:28:48.632 --> 01:28:50.433]  Mark, Mike, Joe, and others, you're up next.

[01:30:27.573 --> 01:30:28.233]  Yes, it's true.

[01:32:36.831 --> 01:32:37.792]  It's Halloween.
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:39.281]  We're good to go.
[01:32:39.301 --> 01:32:39.501]  I think?

[01:33:10.110 --> 01:33:10.991]  I've made ten films.
[01:33:11.031 --> 01:33:12.312]  The tenth has just been released.
[01:33:12.873 --> 01:33:14.075]  It is The Matrix of Evil.
[01:33:14.095 --> 01:33:18.300]  We interview Congresswoman Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Congresswoman, former Congresswoman.
[01:33:20.542 --> 01:33:21.743]  I think we're good to go.
[01:33:46.556 --> 01:33:48.438]  To the Cashless Society Control Grid.
[01:33:48.498 --> 01:33:50.660]  It's a great new film, The Matrix of Evil.

[01:34:33.353 --> 01:34:38.436]  I shot the ritual, got video of it, got all the news articles about what they do in there on top of it.
[01:34:38.516 --> 01:34:39.257]  It's a real place.

[01:35:16.401 --> 01:35:20.423]  Now, going back to our guest, author of Fossilized Customs, Lou White.
[01:35:20.443 --> 01:35:21.464]  It's an excellent little book.
[01:35:21.544 --> 01:35:22.524]  I read it about two years ago.
[01:35:22.544 --> 01:35:24.465]  Couldn't find it this morning when I was digging around for it.
[01:35:25.006 --> 01:35:27.527]  How long is the book, and how much does it cost, and how do folks get it?
[01:35:27.927 --> 01:35:29.608]  Well, there's 148 pages.
[01:35:30.088 --> 01:35:34.971]  It's a soft cover, and it has numerous illustrations, a lot of documentation.
[01:35:35.431 --> 01:35:37.072]  And you can order it by calling 1-877-817-7000.

[01:35:59.942 --> 01:36:01.142]  Or thepowerhour.com.
[01:36:01.162 --> 01:36:01.823]  There's a link there.
[01:36:02.083 --> 01:36:02.263]  Right.
[01:36:02.443 --> 01:36:03.603]  And that's very important.
[01:36:03.623 --> 01:36:04.664]  We'll get that out again before you leave.
[01:36:05.044 --> 01:36:06.445]  Let's go quickly, quickly, folks.
[01:36:06.745 --> 01:36:07.945]  I appreciate you holding.
[01:36:08.645 --> 01:36:09.706]  To Mark...
[01:36:10.459 --> 01:36:11.579]  Ian Texas, go ahead.
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:13.000]  Hi.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:16.601]  I want to commend Mr. White, first of all, for his book.
[01:36:16.621 --> 01:36:18.602]  I do have it, and I do recommend everybody get it.
[01:36:18.862 --> 01:36:27.325]  And I want to commend him for restoring the true paleo-Hebrew names of the Father and the Son, which have been lost through the English translations.
[01:36:27.565 --> 01:36:30.346]  And I just had two real quick questions.
[01:36:30.406 --> 01:36:37.169]  I wanted to ask Mr. White, was Jesus the name of the Hebrew Savior taught by the Jewish Apostles?
[01:36:38.104 --> 01:36:46.130]  No, it wasn't known on the Earth until approximately the 16th century, because the Jesuits started to promote it based upon the Greek.
[01:36:46.530 --> 01:36:54.996]  And the letter J is less than 500 years old, and the S-U-S ending comes from the Greek honoring their deity, Zeus.
[01:36:55.397 --> 01:36:59.680]  Is it also true that the pronunciation Jesus came from the Latin form, Jesus?
[01:37:01.889 --> 01:37:03.670]  It is quite possible.
[01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:07.673]  However, that Latin had dropped some of the Greek letters.
[01:37:07.873 --> 01:37:10.374]  Well, the name in the Bible or the Hebrew is Yahweh, correct?
[01:37:11.315 --> 01:37:13.596]  That's Yod-Heh-Wah-Heh, yes.
[01:37:14.196 --> 01:37:22.161]  Also, we know from Jeremiah 8.8 that the scriptures were prophesied to be mistranslated, and Daniel 7.25 says that they would change Yahweh's times and laws.
[01:37:22.181 --> 01:37:24.903]  Does that therefore make pagan Christianity a teacher of witchcraft?
[01:37:26.411 --> 01:37:27.053]  Yes.
[01:37:27.193 --> 01:37:35.631]  I'm afraid that we are learning witchcraft because we're the servant of the one that we obey, whether we're obeying the adversary or we're obeying our father.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:42.342]  And the customs that we embrace, such as Sunday or Halloween or Easter.
[01:37:43.263 --> 01:37:45.043]  See, Sunday's not in the scriptures.
[01:37:45.164 --> 01:37:49.105]  The first day of the week is mentioned a couple of times, but it has nothing to do with what they think.
[01:37:49.165 --> 01:37:53.807]  And halos, steeples, bells, statues, wreaths, all that holy water, it's all nonsense.
[01:37:53.927 --> 01:37:55.948]  Okay, thank you for the call, Mark.
[01:37:55.988 --> 01:37:59.809]  Yeah, and for those that don't understand this, we'll go ahead and let Mark go.
[01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:03.671]  For those that don't understand this, let me boil it down.
[01:38:04.531 --> 01:38:13.978]  The obelisk in Egypt is the symbol of male power pointing towards the sun god or, yes folks, and this is the encyclopedia too, it is the male sexual appendage.
[01:38:14.538 --> 01:38:21.884]  Now, we see those drugged to Europe, put up in the squares in Paris and London and Frankfurt and Berlin.
[01:38:22.805 --> 01:38:23.986]  It certainly is.
[01:38:24.026 --> 01:38:25.668]  The pagan religion was based upon sex.
[01:38:41.263 --> 01:38:43.544]  It was taught in the calendar.
[01:38:43.624 --> 01:38:49.387]  That's where we get the spring and the fall feasts in the pagan calendar.
[01:38:49.427 --> 01:38:50.267]  It's all impregnation.
[01:38:50.287 --> 01:38:52.608]  They were the big orgy cults of Greece.
[01:38:52.949 --> 01:38:53.169]  Right.
[01:38:53.929 --> 01:38:58.451]  And the temple prostitutes, they were both male or female.
[01:39:00.132 --> 01:39:09.356]  The Vestal Virgins, the whole priesthood of the pagans basically taught the worship of the sun, and they did it by means of the agricultural metaphor of sex.
[01:39:10.453 --> 01:39:12.273]  All right, let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[01:39:12.413 --> 01:39:13.073]  Joe hung up.
[01:39:13.474 --> 01:39:14.754]  Mike in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:39:14.794 --> 01:39:15.194]  Go ahead.
[01:39:15.574 --> 01:39:27.416]  Yes, Luke, can you give me the specific Bible references of where I can find that it pertains to bringing a tree into your home and decorating it with gold and silver, what we call the Christmas tree?
[01:39:27.556 --> 01:39:29.976]  That would be at Jeremiah chapter 10.
[01:39:31.177 --> 01:39:39.298]  Of course, all the mythology concerning that stems from Nimrod and Tammuz, which is where we get the...
[01:39:40.518 --> 01:39:42.219]  Well, we get lent from that.
[01:39:42.239 --> 01:39:46.643]  I mean, the 40 days of fasting, that's the weeping for Tammuz.
[01:39:46.703 --> 01:39:50.645]  That's the 40 days representing the 40 years of Tammuz's life.
[01:39:51.686 --> 01:39:55.569]  But the Christmas tree is described in Jeremiah chapter 10.
[01:39:56.670 --> 01:39:57.030]  Okay.
[01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.911]  Thank you.
[01:39:58.291 --> 01:40:00.413]  Appreciate that call.
[01:40:00.773 --> 01:40:03.215]  Let's go now to Mike in Tennessee.
[01:40:03.335 --> 01:40:04.135]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:40:04.175 --> 01:40:04.576]  Go ahead.
[01:40:05.957 --> 01:40:07.077]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:40:07.157 --> 01:40:07.798]  Yes, welcome.
[01:40:07.818 --> 01:40:07.918]  Hello.
[01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:10.824]  Yes, it's so good to talk to you guys again.
[01:40:11.224 --> 01:40:13.926]  Brother Lou, this is Michael, your friend in Tennessee.
[01:40:13.986 --> 01:40:16.247]  Haven't spoken with you for a couple of weeks now.
[01:40:18.349 --> 01:40:20.790]  I'm sure glad to hear that you're on the air there today.
[01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:34.760]  And to begin with, I would like to start with a very serious warning that's given to the children of the Messiah in the Scriptures in areas that we are dealing with here today in all of the pagan...
[01:40:35.402 --> 01:40:39.184]  But the globalists were masters of even changing the name.
[01:41:03.467 --> 01:41:07.389]  Yes, and I was appalled just a few evenings ago.
[01:41:07.469 --> 01:41:26.959]  I was riding through the little city that we live in here in East Tennessee, Maryville, Tennessee, and as I passed by the Christian churches along the way, I saw the Halloween decorations, the pumpkins, the witches, the ghosts, the warlocks, the shots of corn.
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.621]  And as you said, there are so many...
[01:41:30.346 --> 01:41:32.707]  In the scriptures, there's another warning that is very serious.
[01:41:32.767 --> 01:41:34.347]  It says that in Deuteronomy chapter 7...
[01:41:53.877 --> 01:42:12.385]  That when you participate in these things and acknowledge them and embrace them and cause your sons and daughters to go after other pagan gods, sun gods, and so forth, that the anger of Yahweh will be kindled against you.
[01:42:12.405 --> 01:42:14.766]  Well, give not your children to the fires of Moloch.
[01:42:14.786 --> 01:42:15.366]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:15.546 --> 01:42:16.966]  Yeah, 2 Peter 2, verses 18-22 are good to look at.
[01:42:20.948 --> 01:42:24.654]  Well, look, the point here is, look at the fruits.
[01:42:24.674 --> 01:42:27.378]  Somebody criticized me yesterday for talking about Pat Robertson.
[01:42:27.418 --> 01:42:30.223]  He says forced abortion is what China has to do.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.080]  All of the time.
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:33.761]  I'm going to let you go, Mike.
[01:42:33.801 --> 01:42:34.601]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:34.641 --> 01:42:35.761]  That's the cue to let him go, guys.
[01:42:37.062 --> 01:42:37.582]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:42:37.602 --> 01:42:38.682]  We've got to get to other callers here.
[01:42:39.162 --> 01:42:55.907]  But whenever I read what Pat Robertson says, forced abortions, what China has to do, he said that, folks, on the record two years ago, when he says Arnold's a good candidate when he's for abortion, open borders, gun control, when all of this happens, I mean, that just shows you the fruits of this right out in the open.
[01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:58.390]  Comments, Mr. White?
[01:42:59.211 --> 01:43:04.572]  Well, like I say, the scriptures describe all this stuff from the beginning to the end.
[01:43:05.593 --> 01:43:11.735]  The proverb that Peter quoted, a dog returns to its vomit and a washed sow returns to her rolling in the mud.
[01:43:12.335 --> 01:43:23.579]  He's describing the pagans that were washed and understood that they were living in delusion and they came out of it and then they escaped the defilements of the world being these silly processes and then
[01:43:24.239 --> 01:43:30.321]  They come into it and they fall back into it again because they don't have a good root, you know.
[01:43:30.521 --> 01:43:30.981]  Absolutely.
[01:43:31.021 --> 01:43:31.882]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[01:43:31.922 --> 01:43:33.402]  We're going to have time to make a few more calls.
[01:43:34.082 --> 01:43:35.303]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:43:35.323 --> 01:43:35.383]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:43:35.403 --> 01:43:37.904]  Linda in Wisconsin, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:43:37.924 --> 01:43:38.184]  Go ahead.
[01:43:45.892 --> 01:43:47.333]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:43:47.373 --> 01:43:49.155]  I'll try to be as quick as possible.
[01:43:50.015 --> 01:43:51.376]  I have a very good book here.
[01:43:51.416 --> 01:43:54.939]  It's called Celestial Symbols by Alan H. Barber.
[01:43:54.959 --> 01:44:02.405]  The problem that I have, and it's not just with your guest, it's when I started listening.
[01:44:03.024 --> 01:44:15.909]  To all of those that talked about the pentagram and the all-seeing eye and the dollar bill, etc., when I started to do my research, I found out that these symbols all come from God to begin with.
[01:44:16.489 --> 01:44:17.490]  Oh, really?
[01:44:17.890 --> 01:44:26.033]  And the all-seeing eye, God says to the Israelites, you are the apple of my eye and there isn't anything that you do that God does not see.
[01:44:27.574 --> 01:44:28.374]  Oh, come on, lady.
[01:44:29.235 --> 01:44:30.876]  This is on all the enemy's banners.
[01:44:30.916 --> 01:44:31.297]  Hold on.
[01:44:31.697 --> 01:44:37.101]  It's on all the enemy's banners, the swastika, the tree, the eye, the eagle, all of it.
[01:44:38.202 --> 01:44:42.445]  Alex, I just got through saying they all started out to be symbols of God.
[01:44:43.947 --> 01:44:45.928]  And his teaching us the gospel.
[01:44:46.408 --> 01:44:50.069]  But then when wickedness enters in... Well, yeah, counterfeit.
[01:44:50.089 --> 01:44:50.829]  I agree with you.
[01:44:50.889 --> 01:44:54.271]  Lucifer takes the very same thing that belongs to God.
[01:44:54.671 --> 01:44:56.651]  Why do you think he took the pentagram?
[01:44:56.992 --> 01:45:06.515]  Because in Revelation 22, 16, it says, "...the prophecy was fulfilled when the star appeared in Bethlehem on the night of the birth of Jesus."
[01:45:06.995 --> 01:45:12.737]  This is called the Star of the East and the Star of Bethlehem, and you can find it in old ancient churches.
[01:45:13.277 --> 01:45:15.698]  Not that the people were worshiping the star.
[01:45:16.338 --> 01:45:18.259]  It was the symbol of Jesus Christ.
[01:45:18.339 --> 01:45:19.999]  Okay, let me see what our expert thinks.
[01:45:20.019 --> 01:45:20.559]  Mr. White?
[01:45:21.019 --> 01:45:34.924]  Well, the symbol that we see in Scripture, we see a lot of examples and metaphors, but the principal symbol of Israel is the menorah, and it's also the emblem, the menorah, or the lampstand in Revelation 1.
[01:45:35.484 --> 01:45:38.825]  That's the symbol of our Savior.
[01:45:40.131 --> 01:45:42.233]  He's walking in the midst of the seven lamps.
[01:45:42.593 --> 01:45:48.176]  That's representing the assembly, you know, over time.
[01:45:49.016 --> 01:45:54.019]  You know, if I could just have something to say here, because when I hang up, you're going to get to talk some more.
[01:45:54.519 --> 01:46:02.384]  Like the color blue, the blue that the United Nations has stolen and used that, well, that's Jesus' color.
[01:46:02.524 --> 01:46:03.565]  The color blue is Zeus.
[01:46:03.625 --> 01:46:05.686]  That was used in the tabernacle, and it was taken.
[01:46:05.986 --> 01:46:07.567]  I took a Hebrew class, and...
[01:46:08.087 --> 01:46:13.669]  They had to take that blue from a special fish and use it.
[01:46:13.869 --> 01:46:15.909]  I mean, it was God who told them to do that.
[01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:17.210]  Here's one last thing.
[01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:25.012]  In the Old Testament, when the Israelites were being bitten by the fiery serpents, God told
[01:46:25.872 --> 01:46:27.553]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[01:46:28.014 --> 01:46:29.355]  Appreciate the call.
[01:46:29.415 --> 01:46:29.695]  Thank you.
[01:46:29.715 --> 01:46:30.956]  Any comments to what she was saying?
[01:46:30.996 --> 01:46:32.216]  Yes, I think what we have here is...
[01:46:47.248 --> 01:46:48.489]  Okay, absolutely.
[01:47:16.624 --> 01:47:19.105]  Let's talk to, I believe it's Bruce is up next.
[01:47:19.165 --> 01:47:20.506]  Bruce, you're calling us from Kentucky.
[01:47:20.746 --> 01:47:24.228]  Yeah, give me the symbolism of the bunny rabbit and the eggs.
[01:47:24.748 --> 01:47:29.971]  That basically came from the Babylonians, and it went through the Egyptians.
[01:47:30.171 --> 01:47:32.432]  Fertility, female side of Lucifer.
[01:47:32.633 --> 01:47:42.058]  Yeah, see, the deity the Romans worshipped under the name Venus was Aphrodite in Greek, and it was Astarte, or Aphrodite.
[01:47:44.298 --> 01:47:50.282]  Well, Astarte or Ishtar to the people of Persia and Babylonia.
[01:47:50.883 --> 01:48:10.035]  And they claim that between the Tigris and the Euphrates, one of those, I think it was in the Euphrates River, that they said that they claim the myth of an egg fell out of the sky and this deity that they worship, this female, came out of the egg among the bulrushes and that's where we get the wicker baskets and the eggs and things, you know.
[01:48:10.516 --> 01:48:12.277]  And it's all Babylonian nonsense, but
[01:48:12.757 --> 01:48:14.118]  It's delusion, you know.
[01:48:15.199 --> 01:48:16.500]  But it's all over the earth now.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:17.981]  Uh-huh.
[01:48:18.902 --> 01:48:19.062]  Okay.
[01:48:19.082 --> 01:48:20.323]  Does that answer your question, sir?
[01:48:20.363 --> 01:48:21.024]  Yes, fine.
[01:48:21.364 --> 01:48:22.165]  All right, thank you.
[01:48:22.245 --> 01:48:23.706]  Charles in Florida.
[01:48:23.746 --> 01:48:24.586]  Charles, you're on the air.
[01:48:24.606 --> 01:48:25.027]  Go ahead.
[01:48:26.668 --> 01:48:26.928]  Yeah.
[01:48:27.188 --> 01:48:28.489]  The phones kind of sound weird.
[01:48:28.510 --> 01:48:30.371]  Can we, like, do something with that?
[01:48:30.391 --> 01:48:31.011]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:48:31.672 --> 01:48:33.674]  Yeah, I'd like to correct certain things you're saying.
[01:48:33.714 --> 01:48:35.855]  I'm not totally disagreeing with what you're saying.
[01:48:35.895 --> 01:48:41.760]  But the first place, Easter, if you look up in the etymology dictionary, comes from the goddess Elstra.
[01:48:42.463 --> 01:48:45.104]  Sir, let me stop you for just a second.
[01:48:45.144 --> 01:48:46.704]  Charles, let me stop you for just a second.
[01:48:47.485 --> 01:48:49.205]  And then I'll let you talk.
[01:48:49.345 --> 01:48:50.746]  I'll hold you over when we have to.
[01:48:51.146 --> 01:48:51.366]  Look.
[01:49:11.627 --> 01:49:12.107]  We're good to go.
[01:49:12.127 --> 01:49:12.267]  I think?
[01:49:30.757 --> 01:49:36.119]  They're all doing the same stuff on the same days according to the sun, according to the moon, according to the stars.
[01:49:36.659 --> 01:49:39.880]  And yes, this occultism is rampant globally.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:40.881]  That's historical.
[01:49:40.921 --> 01:49:41.781]  That's mainstream.
[01:49:42.401 --> 01:49:43.421]  Comments, Mr. White?
[01:49:44.202 --> 01:49:48.243]  Well, he's going in... Charles is going into the etymology of the word J-E-S-U-S.
[01:49:49.364 --> 01:49:53.085]  You know, and of course the Jesuits promote that name, but it comes from the Greek.
[01:49:53.225 --> 01:49:54.505]  But we have to forget the Greek.
[01:49:54.525 --> 01:49:55.666]  He doesn't have a Greek name.
[01:49:56.166 --> 01:49:58.327]  You have to go back and look at Acts 7...
[01:49:59.427 --> 01:50:02.589]  And you'll see the name J-E-S-U-S and Joshua.
[01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:04.611]  The underlying Greek letters are the same.
[01:50:04.971 --> 01:50:07.372]  So go back to the Hebrew, and you'll see Joshua's real name.
[01:50:07.392 --> 01:50:09.934]  Yeah, all we're saying is, what's wrong with going back to the original language?
[01:50:10.034 --> 01:50:13.336]  Yeah, Joshua, his name wasn't Joshua, it was Yahshua.
[01:50:13.356 --> 01:50:16.038]  All right, we'll be, I'll tell you what, I'll let you finish up, Charles.
[01:50:16.058 --> 01:50:17.579]  When we get back, stay with us, folks.
[01:50:21.866 --> 01:50:23.847]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:50:23.947 --> 01:50:24.587]  Hello, folks.
[01:50:24.707 --> 01:50:34.651]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:50:35.031 --> 01:50:39.533]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:50:39.613 --> 01:50:50.937]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:50:51.537 --> 01:50:58.382]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:50:58.782 --> 01:51:00.923]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:51:01.424 --> 01:51:06.407]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[01:52:20.686 --> 01:52:28.608]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:52:28.948 --> 01:52:30.308]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[01:52:30.508 --> 01:52:32.708]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:52:32.869 --> 01:52:34.029]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:52:35.169 --> 01:52:35.830]  We're good to go.
[01:53:03.268 --> 01:53:03.688]  We're good to go.
[01:53:03.708 --> 01:53:04.409]  We're good to go.
[01:53:04.489 --> 01:53:05.169]  We're good to go.
[01:53:36.283 --> 01:53:38.747]  We can finish up with Charles, Bill, Everett, Elaine, and others.
[01:53:39.488 --> 01:53:43.334]  Poll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:43.996 --> 01:53:50.346]  Look, this is just an exercise on learning history, the meanings of words, looking at what our customs are.
[01:53:51.133 --> 01:54:09.157]  And one of the strongest things that's been said here today, and the Coca-Cola brags about this, by the way, at their big national museum, that they took the image of Santa Claus in the late 40s, early 50s, made him black and white, the color of Coca-Cola, put him on all the Coke bottles, and then that was the image of Santa Claus.
[01:54:09.177 --> 01:54:11.478]  Before that, he was an evil elf.
[01:54:12.598 --> 01:54:14.559]  And that's mainstream stuff.
[01:54:14.999 --> 01:54:16.379]  Look at the power of the media.
[01:54:16.839 --> 01:54:18.219]  So the power today...
[01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.510]  We're good to go.
[01:54:47.865 --> 01:54:50.446]  The whole New World Order system is about being hidden in plain view.
[01:54:50.846 --> 01:54:52.307]  It's about their symbols being out there.
[01:54:52.327 --> 01:54:54.868]  That's where they get their power, they believe, and they do get power from it.
[01:54:55.748 --> 01:55:00.770]  We were asking Lou if he could stay longer with us, and I think Pence was asking me instead of talking to him.
[01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:03.551]  But let's go back to Lou White.
[01:55:03.591 --> 01:55:04.211]  Lou, do we have you?
[01:55:04.491 --> 01:55:04.991]  Yes, we do.
[01:55:05.071 --> 01:55:05.351]  I'm here.
[01:55:05.731 --> 01:55:07.112]  Can you stay with us into the next hour?
[01:55:07.312 --> 01:55:08.172]  Yes, I certainly can.
[01:55:08.332 --> 01:55:09.253]  Oh, well, that's fantastic.
[01:55:11.094 --> 01:55:16.238]  Now, before we go back to these calls, let's just go back to Charles and see what else he has to say.
[01:55:16.258 --> 01:55:16.958]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:55:17.198 --> 01:55:25.765]  Yes, the name Jesus could have just as well, since Jesus lived in a Hellenistic area.
[01:55:25.825 --> 01:55:26.345]  It was Greek.
[01:55:26.566 --> 01:55:29.528]  It could be derived from the Greek word Jason.
[01:55:29.708 --> 01:55:32.810]  It means healer, which is identical to Yeshua.
[01:55:32.850 --> 01:55:34.772]  It means Yah helps or saves.
[01:55:35.307 --> 01:55:36.308]  It has the same meaning.
[01:55:36.928 --> 01:55:41.151]  Hebrew and Greek belong to totally different languages.
[01:55:41.171 --> 01:55:43.653]  Well, sir, I mean, the Bible says Yahweh.
[01:55:43.673 --> 01:55:47.676]  I mean, why be defensive about, okay, it's Greek.
[01:55:47.996 --> 01:55:48.857]  It could be Greek.
[01:55:48.917 --> 01:55:49.798]  I'm just saying it could be.
[01:55:49.838 --> 01:55:50.818]  Well, no, it says it's Greek.
[01:55:50.938 --> 01:55:51.259]  Okay.
[01:55:53.616 --> 01:55:59.319]  Yeah, it could mean a lot of things.
[01:55:59.339 --> 01:56:08.443]  The fundamentalists, like your guest, want to say, oh, for the last 2,000 years, Jesus didn't know how to pronounce his own name or the church father.
[01:56:09.023 --> 01:56:10.084]  That's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:56:10.864 --> 01:56:20.449]  And you're saying that typical fundamentalists, that there was such a character as Nimrod, point to me in any history book about Sumer that there was...
[01:56:20.891 --> 01:56:27.757]  With any god or any cultural hero like Gilgamesh, Nimrod, that's just from Genesis.
[01:56:28.718 --> 01:56:31.140]  People of Israel were in captivity in Babylon.
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:33.082]  They totally corrupted names.
[01:56:33.102 --> 01:56:34.163]  They didn't know etymology.
[01:56:34.203 --> 01:56:36.946]  They didn't know that Babylon meant gate of the god.
[01:56:36.986 --> 01:56:38.948]  They said it meant confusion of tongues.
[01:56:39.068 --> 01:56:40.429]  Of course, in Hebrew it meant that.
[01:56:41.252 --> 01:56:45.174]  Well, no, they were saying that it causes confusion.
[01:56:45.194 --> 01:56:51.876]  Samuel Noah Kramer says about the first book of Genesis, the first verse is about Jesus.
[01:56:52.636 --> 01:56:54.097]  I mean, not Jesus, Adam and Eve.
[01:56:54.217 --> 01:57:02.240]  Adam in Sumerian means man, and Eve in Sumerian could be T, meaning rib or life.
[01:57:03.134 --> 01:57:04.915]  Okay, thank you for the call, Charles.
[01:57:04.935 --> 01:57:07.136]  We're going to break and come back and take more calls in the next hour.
[01:57:07.496 --> 01:57:11.938]  Any other points you'd like to make for the audience that doesn't get to hear the third hour, sir?
[01:57:12.198 --> 01:57:25.063]  Well, to address the last caller, the defense of what they call the English word, Yeshua, is actually a Jesuit thing that they derived, and it's less than 500 years old.
[01:57:25.463 --> 01:57:29.385]  But the original Savior's name, Yahshua or Yehoshua,
[01:57:30.627 --> 01:57:35.008]  It was based upon, you know, the spelling of the prophet that we call, or the leader.
[01:57:35.028 --> 01:57:42.629]  Well, look, certainly there are different translations and different meanings of words, but the point here is we're talking about Halloween being a satanic holiday.
[01:57:42.849 --> 01:57:43.189]  It's true.
[01:57:43.229 --> 01:57:45.210]  We're talking about Ishtar, Easter.
[01:57:45.450 --> 01:57:46.070]  That's admitted.
[01:57:46.290 --> 01:57:49.670]  We're talking about, you know, Santa Claus has nothing to do with Jesus Christ.
[01:57:49.751 --> 01:57:50.011]  Right.
[01:57:50.051 --> 01:57:51.331]  That stuff we can all agree on.
[01:57:51.431 --> 01:57:51.951]  Third hour.
[01:57:52.211 --> 01:57:52.411]  Right.
[01:57:52.611 --> 01:57:57.412]  Third hour coming up, folks, with our guest, Lou White, and we'll talk to Bill and...
[01:57:58.332 --> 01:58:00.893]  Many others that are patiently holding in the third hour.
[01:58:00.913 --> 01:58:04.234]  Then I'll get into a bunch of other news items and other calls and other issues.
[01:58:04.634 --> 01:58:05.614]  We'll be back with the third hour.
[01:58:05.634 --> 01:58:06.375]  I hope you stay with us.
[01:58:06.495 --> 01:58:08.715]  InfoWars.com is the website.
[01:58:08.736 --> 01:58:10.036]  The new movie, Matrix of Evil, is out.
[01:58:13.417 --> 01:58:17.939]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:58:18.279 --> 01:58:22.300]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:58:26.014 --> 01:58:30.056]  You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:37.458 --> 01:58:41.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.100]  You want answers?
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:44.781]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:44.801 --> 01:58:49.142]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:49.602 --> 01:58:53.684]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:55.117 --> 01:59:03.307]  Alright, we're now about 30 seconds into the third and final hour of this 31st of October 2003 transmission.
[01:59:04.088 --> 01:59:05.270]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:59:05.310 --> 01:59:13.460]  This broadcast is about getting your mind outside the box, getting you to learn history, whether it's American history, world history, religious history.
[01:59:14.088 --> 01:59:16.949]  And we've got a guest on, and I've done a lot of research on this, and I've read his book.
[01:59:16.969 --> 01:59:20.270]  When I read it a couple years ago, I found it to be very, very accurate.
[01:59:21.751 --> 01:59:24.132]  Your interpretations can all differ and be different.
[01:59:24.432 --> 01:59:25.912]  I'm sure none of us totally agree with each other.
[01:59:26.672 --> 01:59:31.174]  But Lou Weitz's name and the book is Fossilized Customs.
[01:59:32.416 --> 01:59:33.657]  Where does Santa Claus come from?
[01:59:33.697 --> 01:59:36.378]  Where does the bunny, rabbit, and the eggs come from in the wicker basket?
[01:59:37.198 --> 01:59:40.939]  Where does the ghosts and goblins and the jack-o'-lanterns come from?
[01:59:41.359 --> 01:59:50.323]  Well, we know where it comes from, from archaeology, from histories written by the Romans, the Jews, the Babylonians, the Japanese, the Hawaiians.
[01:59:50.983 --> 01:59:53.144]  On these certain holidays, you got human sacrifice.
[01:59:53.974 --> 01:59:58.517]  And you've got a lot of government control and basically mind control going on by the Witch Doctor class.
[01:59:58.737 --> 02:00:00.178]  That is the New World Order of the day.
[02:00:00.238 --> 02:00:03.360]  So why do the global leaders carry out occult rituals?
[02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:08.344]  Because this is what their caste, their clan of mind controllers, have it into forever.
[02:00:08.944 --> 02:00:10.505]  And we've got loaded phone lines here.
[02:00:10.525 --> 02:00:11.946]  We're going to go back to them here in just a few minutes.
[02:00:11.966 --> 02:00:13.427]  We've got about 20 minutes left with our guests.
[02:00:13.947 --> 02:00:15.328]  Lou White, I heard you jumping in there.
[02:00:15.348 --> 02:00:16.189]  Something you want to say?
[02:00:16.549 --> 02:00:17.270]  Oh, no, you're fine.
[02:00:17.950 --> 02:00:23.774]  I was just agreeing with the Illuminati and the New World Order is all based upon this ancient Babylonian occult.
[02:00:24.014 --> 02:00:27.536]  And it's about keeping us in the dark while they have the knowledge.
[02:00:29.097 --> 02:00:30.918]  Exactly, using that hidden knowledge to control us.
[02:00:31.839 --> 02:00:33.300]  Let's talk to Bill in New Jersey.
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:34.180]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:35.481]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:00:35.901 --> 02:00:36.401]  Yes, I can.
[02:00:36.822 --> 02:00:38.082]  Yeah, first time caller, Alex.
[02:00:38.102 --> 02:00:39.383]  Been listening to you for many years.
[02:00:39.743 --> 02:00:40.644]  Well, thank you for calling.
[02:00:40.704 --> 02:00:44.106]  You've got a great show, and I disagree with your guest.
[02:00:44.866 --> 02:00:51.370]  I think the problem, Alex, is that Jesus is who he says he is, and he founded a church, and the church is who it says it is.
[02:00:51.450 --> 02:00:52.431]  It's the Catholic Church.
[02:00:53.069 --> 02:00:57.957]  The Jews didn't accept Jesus, and the friend here doesn't accept the truth of the Catholic Church.
[02:00:57.997 --> 02:00:58.979]  The problem is, St.
[02:00:59.059 --> 02:01:02.525]  Paul said these things would not come about until there was a great falling away.
[02:01:03.641 --> 02:01:03.961]  And St.
[02:01:04.022 --> 02:01:13.392]  Paul's great falling away is the Protestant Reformation, and we are getting... This is the end result of almost 490 years of Protestantism is this mass confusion that we have.
[02:01:13.432 --> 02:01:14.133]  Sir, I'll say this.
[02:01:14.193 --> 02:01:17.277]  There's definitely a lot of corruption in the Protestant Church, and I'll criticize it.
[02:01:17.357 --> 02:01:18.058]  I'm not a Catholic.
[02:01:18.078 --> 02:01:19.099]  I have a lot of Catholic friends.
[02:01:19.119 --> 02:01:21.281]  See them out fighting evil everywhere around me.
[02:01:21.341 --> 02:01:23.364]  But I'll... You know, from Hutton, Gibson...
[02:01:23.884 --> 02:01:24.505]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:01:24.845 --> 02:01:25.606]  We're good to go.
[02:01:43.142 --> 02:01:46.845]  Trying to take them away from the pagans, not to continue them.
[02:01:46.865 --> 02:01:52.889]  But my point is that by not eradicating those, now it's grown back up through it and has taken it over.
[02:01:52.909 --> 02:01:57.273]  Alex, they may have eradicated them if it wasn't for the Protestant Reformation.
[02:01:57.313 --> 02:02:01.135]  We've had 490 years almost of anti-Catholicism in the world.
[02:02:01.896 --> 02:02:07.420]  But you have to admit, I mean, men are fallible and there have been corrupt people in the Catholic Church.
[02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:10.202]  Jesus isn't infallible.
[02:02:10.262 --> 02:02:11.263]  Jesus is infallible.
[02:02:11.303 --> 02:02:14.446]  He gave us a teaching institution in the world for us to follow.
[02:02:14.847 --> 02:02:16.388]  Can I say something, Bill?
[02:02:16.408 --> 02:02:16.909]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:25.416]  Bill, let me ask you this, not to bash Catholics, but who was it that instigated the 600-year Inquisition?
[02:02:25.837 --> 02:02:27.198]  Was that the Protestants, or...?
[02:02:28.214 --> 02:02:30.695]  You know, did the Protestants kill 83 million people?
[02:02:31.195 --> 02:02:33.755]  You know, we're fighting for eternal souls here, you know.
[02:02:33.795 --> 02:02:35.296]  This is just about who's government.
[02:02:35.336 --> 02:02:39.777]  And if your soul is going to be lost, the church has a right to defend itself and to save souls.
[02:02:39.817 --> 02:02:42.817]  The church is put here on this earth to save souls.
[02:02:42.857 --> 02:02:43.757]  Sir, can I just say this?
[02:02:43.797 --> 02:02:49.519]  Are you saying everybody who was in the Catholic Church, that powerful people didn't use it as a way to go after their political enemies?
[02:02:49.659 --> 02:02:51.859]  Didn't Jesus say that there's sinners in his church?
[02:02:51.879 --> 02:02:53.660]  Didn't he say that he had a... Well, certainly so.
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:55.400]  But look, I mean, this whole line about...
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:58.585]  Pat Robertson being infallible or the Pope being infallible?
[02:02:58.605 --> 02:03:01.931]  The Pope is infallible when he's teaching on doctrines of faith and morals.
[02:03:02.331 --> 02:03:04.114]  Can you give me a scripture on that?
[02:03:05.076 --> 02:03:06.699]  You have to give me scripture on that one.
[02:03:07.039 --> 02:03:07.901]  I haven't ever read that.
[02:03:11.602 --> 02:03:14.186]  I'll tell you what, when somebody disagrees, we're going to hold them over.
[02:03:14.206 --> 02:03:17.250]  And if this goes long, Mr. White, can you stay with us?
[02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.750]  Sure.
[02:03:18.051 --> 02:03:22.977]  Okay, stay there, Bill, and we'll go to Everett and Elaine and Roger and Keith and everybody else.
[02:03:23.018 --> 02:03:26.482]  But if you disagree with anything on this show, we're just here to get you thinking, folks.
[02:03:26.502 --> 02:03:28.505]  If you disagree, man, you get extra time.
[02:03:28.545 --> 02:03:29.186]  We'll be right back.

[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:41.763]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:03:41.943 --> 02:03:46.307]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:03:46.347 --> 02:03:47.688]  The New World Order.
[02:03:48.468 --> 02:03:49.470]  Can't emerge.
[02:03:49.490 --> 02:03:53.695]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[02:06:33.712 --> 02:06:35.892]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:06:36.473 --> 02:06:39.333]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:39.393 --> 02:06:54.676]  All right, my friends.
[02:06:54.936 --> 02:06:56.617]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:06:57.917 --> 02:07:02.178]  And the main focus here is we know Halloween, Samhain, Samhain,
[02:07:03.041 --> 02:07:12.443]  Is a druidic, well, pan-global human sacrifice date, and that's just the historical record.
[02:07:12.943 --> 02:07:19.025]  We know that Santa Claus is not a Christian deity, saint, creature, whatever.
[02:07:19.545 --> 02:07:26.186]  We know that Easter, the term Ishtar, the eggs, the bunny, the fertility, I mean, that's just all fact, folks.
[02:07:26.647 --> 02:07:27.867]  That's what I'm covering here.
[02:07:29.127 --> 02:07:32.088]  I'm not into a big battle over, you know, how the...
[02:07:33.058 --> 02:07:37.701]  You know, Catholic Church came in and took over all these pagan rituals and put, you know, the names of saints in over it.
[02:07:38.001 --> 02:07:40.002]  And obviously now the cultism's grown back in.
[02:07:40.022 --> 02:07:41.763]  I'm not here to bash the Protestants, the Catholics.
[02:07:43.064 --> 02:07:45.125]  But, I mean, the entire Christian religion...
[02:07:45.859 --> 02:07:46.699]  We're good to go.
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:47.220]  We're good to go.
[02:08:12.677 --> 02:08:14.457]  And we got false prophets all over the place.
[02:08:14.477 --> 02:08:15.298]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:08:15.338 --> 02:08:20.619]  But Mr. White continuing to comment on what Bill was saying in New Jersey.
[02:08:20.639 --> 02:08:21.479]  Then we'll go back to Bill.
[02:08:21.519 --> 02:08:21.879]  Go ahead.
[02:08:23.839 --> 02:08:24.279]  Okay.
[02:08:24.519 --> 02:08:33.401]  I was just addressing... I asked Bill if he thought that the Inquisition was Protestant or Catholic, and it was a persecution that lasted 600 years.
[02:08:35.061 --> 02:08:38.602]  And the Catholics... I'm not bashing Catholics themselves, but the teachings...
[02:08:39.238 --> 02:08:40.459]  Okay, let's get a comment from Bill.
[02:08:40.479 --> 02:08:40.800]  Go ahead, Bill.
[02:09:00.373 --> 02:09:02.234]  Well, there's 365 days in a year.
[02:09:02.254 --> 02:09:03.534]  What kind of calendar do you want?
[02:09:03.554 --> 02:09:07.616]  But what I mean is that the Church has a right, because it's in Jesus' name it's doing this.
[02:09:07.937 --> 02:09:10.858]  It's His instrument in the world, and the confusion is coming about.
[02:09:11.571 --> 02:09:12.972]  I'm following his instrument.
[02:09:12.992 --> 02:09:19.077]  You know, there's one Catholic church after 2,000 years, and there's 35,000, at least, Protestant churches.
[02:09:19.757 --> 02:09:20.478]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:09:20.498 --> 02:09:21.279]  He would not scatter.
[02:09:21.299 --> 02:09:22.039]  He would gather.
[02:09:22.059 --> 02:09:22.940]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:27.023]  All this confusion is coming from not following the authorized teachers.
[02:09:27.083 --> 02:09:29.905]  Jesus told the apostles to go out and teach all nations.
[02:09:30.246 --> 02:09:34.149]  He didn't say open up a print shop and print Bibles and hand them out and let everybody read them.
[02:09:34.509 --> 02:09:36.230]  That's where the confusion is coming from.
[02:09:36.250 --> 02:09:38.292]  Well, in other words... One shepherd.
[02:09:38.412 --> 02:09:39.753]  That's what Jesus left us with.
[02:09:39.973 --> 02:09:41.334]  And people aren't following that.
[02:09:41.555 --> 02:09:45.978]  And what you're saying about this satanic influence in these holidays is true.
[02:09:46.158 --> 02:09:50.142]  It's because of confusion, not following the true teachers.
[02:09:50.462 --> 02:09:53.184]  Well, our Father's Kingdom isn't based in Rome, Italy.
[02:09:53.365 --> 02:09:57.348]  That's where the Mithrists were based, and it was the same organization that took over.
[02:09:57.388 --> 02:09:57.828]  Where are they?
[02:09:57.868 --> 02:09:59.049]  The Catholic Church is there.
[02:09:59.089 --> 02:10:01.692]  Jesus said his church would be a light on a hill.
[02:10:01.752 --> 02:10:02.993]  Now, where is your church from?
[02:10:03.033 --> 02:10:04.654]  Everybody knows where the Catholic Church is.
[02:10:04.754 --> 02:10:05.315]  Ask anybody.
[02:10:05.375 --> 02:10:06.055]  It's in Rome.
[02:10:06.416 --> 02:10:08.017]  We ourselves are the church.
[02:10:08.197 --> 02:10:08.897]  We're the body.
[02:10:08.937 --> 02:10:10.098]  No, he founded a church.
[02:10:10.138 --> 02:10:11.538]  He said, hear the church.
[02:10:11.558 --> 02:10:12.558]  He didn't say, hear you.
[02:10:13.518 --> 02:10:15.659]  Well, no, we speak through him.
[02:10:15.719 --> 02:10:18.360]  The church is the pillar and ground of truth.
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:19.320]  It's right in the Bible.
[02:10:19.340 --> 02:10:20.300]  All right, thank you.
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:21.261]  Thank you for the call.
[02:10:21.281 --> 02:10:22.421]  I appreciate it, Bill.
[02:10:23.161 --> 02:10:24.441]  Everett in Pennsylvania.
[02:10:24.461 --> 02:10:25.182]  Go ahead, Everett.
[02:10:26.982 --> 02:10:27.702]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:10:27.882 --> 02:10:28.483]  Great show.
[02:10:28.763 --> 02:10:29.683]  Thank you.
[02:10:30.763 --> 02:10:37.445]  I've heard this argument many times from Christians whenever I go to show them that the symbol in the back of the dollar bill
[02:10:38.072 --> 02:10:38.673]  Yeah, I think that's great.
[02:10:43.789 --> 02:10:44.609]  That's the eye of God.
[02:10:44.649 --> 02:10:50.851]  Why would they put this eye of God on top of a pagan symbol that was the enemy, and the Egyptians were the enemy?
[02:10:51.051 --> 02:11:01.154]  Yeah, the enemy of the Jews, and we stick it up there, and it's the New World Order symbol, and it's the eye of Sauron from the medieval teacher J.R.R.
[02:11:01.214 --> 02:11:07.455]  Tolkien, who studied occult religions, and his demon god is a pyramid with a burning eye on top of it.
[02:11:07.715 --> 02:11:10.116]  And Adam Weishaupt adopted it, too, yeah.
[02:11:11.676 --> 02:11:17.439]  I'm just saying, everywhere, a pile of stones with a burning eye on top of it, that's Big Daddy Devil.
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:24.442]  Christians think that this brings confusion into the Christians, and they think that's okay.
[02:11:24.462 --> 02:11:26.824]  That is absolute garbage.
[02:11:27.064 --> 02:11:32.126]  The rays coming out of the eye, that also comes from illumination, which is from the sonic religion.
[02:11:32.226 --> 02:11:34.007]  Yeah, the secret light, the hidden light.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.962]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:36.982 --> 02:11:37.362]  You bet.
[02:11:37.602 --> 02:11:38.903]  Good to hear from you, Pennsylvania.
[02:11:38.943 --> 02:11:40.684]  Let's talk to Elaine in Missouri.
[02:11:41.005 --> 02:11:43.647]  Elaine, you're on the air globally.
[02:11:45.588 --> 02:11:46.529]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:11:46.549 --> 02:11:46.949]  Go ahead.
[02:11:46.969 --> 02:11:53.394]  All of the great old civilizations were destroyed by the trade route robbers.
[02:11:54.355 --> 02:12:03.182]  And that area that the trade route robbing took place mostly, although it took place over a lot of places, was the land of Israel.
[02:12:05.038 --> 02:12:08.900]  So you're recommending that we go to witches and find out what the truth is?
[02:12:36.016 --> 02:12:38.778]  Let me tell you something, ma'am.
[02:12:38.798 --> 02:12:41.020]  Let me add something, and then you can answer.
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:41.840]  You know what?
[02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:42.500]  I'm going to shut up.
[02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:43.581]  You talk, then I'll finish.
[02:12:43.601 --> 02:12:43.921]  Go ahead.
[02:12:44.702 --> 02:12:50.926]  Well, I just feel sorry for you people who are still victims of such a consciousness-lowering book.
[02:12:52.266 --> 02:12:54.588]  You've got the secret knowledge, don't you?
[02:12:54.608 --> 02:12:55.388]  You ate the apple.
[02:12:55.408 --> 02:12:57.670]  She ate the red pill.
[02:12:57.930 --> 02:13:01.052]  The Bible is copied from the old Babylonian books.
[02:13:01.542 --> 02:13:13.473]  In the old Persian books, and it was misprinted by the, well, the Jews changed it around so that there was only one God, and that made them chosen, and then they became the chosen people.
[02:13:13.773 --> 02:13:17.917]  Where is this knowledge coming from that you're stating?
[02:13:18.837 --> 02:13:19.258]  Facts.
[02:13:19.338 --> 02:13:24.002]  I mean, I don't rely on documents like you people do, because documents are there to lie.
[02:13:24.382 --> 02:13:26.344]  Let me talk now.
[02:13:26.704 --> 02:13:27.205]  Let me talk.
[02:13:27.245 --> 02:13:27.565]  We'll go back.
[02:13:27.645 --> 02:13:28.506]  It's a conversation here.
[02:13:29.264 --> 02:13:32.967]  So you get your power from the male horn god and from the goddess?
[02:13:34.048 --> 02:13:36.290]  Well, I guess I get it from my higher self.
[02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:38.191]  How big are those horns on that god you worship?
[02:13:38.231 --> 02:13:38.892]  Just tell me.
[02:13:39.592 --> 02:13:41.674]  I get it from my higher self.
[02:13:41.814 --> 02:13:48.399]  Did your pagans that your modern, really old religion comes from, did they not sacrifice children worldwide?
[02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:50.841]  Well, they were very degenerate people.
[02:13:50.901 --> 02:13:53.163]  I mean, they were, Lord knows what they were.
[02:13:53.363 --> 02:13:57.346]  Okay, let me, well, we know we have the archaeology, we have the facts, but let me just stop you.
[02:13:58.189 --> 02:14:06.077]  I look at the fruits, okay, and the Hebraic roots, what Moses did, what Abraham did was different from the entire world.
[02:14:06.598 --> 02:14:12.324]  All the trash, the sacrifice, the corruption, everything that the world was, this was new.
[02:14:12.844 --> 02:14:17.929]  And the fruits of it have been good families, good cultures, all the inventions, everything.
[02:14:17.949 --> 02:14:18.290]  No, no.
[02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:23.271]  I look at the fruits of the tree, and the tree you're talking about brings death and mindlessness.
[02:14:23.331 --> 02:14:30.353]  The tree that I eat off of brings me life and intelligence and family and honor and duty and a disgust of evil.
[02:14:30.553 --> 02:14:31.573]  Comments, Mr. White?
[02:14:31.593 --> 02:14:38.995]  Well, misinterpretations of the commandments and the text of Scripture have resulted in many, many people being killed.
[02:14:39.115 --> 02:14:40.096]  Millions and millions.
[02:14:40.176 --> 02:14:41.536]  I mean, the Catholics killed millions.
[02:14:41.976 --> 02:14:44.777]  And thinking that they were doing it for our Father, but...
[02:14:45.297 --> 02:14:47.258]  You know, he doesn't need to be defended.
[02:14:47.518 --> 02:14:49.479]  You know, he can take care of things on his own.
[02:14:49.839 --> 02:14:54.401]  And it says in the scriptures in Revelation that he is in fact not going to need anybody's help.
[02:14:54.441 --> 02:14:55.561]  He's going to do it personally.
[02:14:56.181 --> 02:14:59.582]  You know, but we're to submit to his commandments.
[02:15:00.863 --> 02:15:04.564]  He said, go and teach all nations what I have taught you.
[02:15:04.664 --> 02:15:06.205]  And those are the Ten Commandments.
[02:15:06.736 --> 02:15:19.922]  But see how this has gone off again into a big discussion of Christianity when I'm talking about these occult religions right out in the open, admitted over... Ma'am, if you're into the occult, you certainly know what Halloween really is, don't you?
[02:15:20.504 --> 02:15:22.225]  I'm not that deep into the occult.
[02:15:22.646 --> 02:15:24.307]  I just dabble.
[02:15:24.407 --> 02:15:29.190]  Dabble in white magic, which Anton LaVey said is the most destructive form of black magic.
[02:15:29.471 --> 02:15:35.935]  But the fruits of the lies of the Bible are war, and we've had nothing but war since the Bible.
[02:15:36.136 --> 02:15:36.876]  Hold on just a minute.
[02:15:37.216 --> 02:15:44.902]  There have been a bunch of other religions killing a bunch of people, and to sit there and say that Christianity did it, corrupt people did it, kings and governments did it.
[02:15:45.923 --> 02:15:48.925]  Yeah, and ones that were led by religious fanatics.
[02:15:50.151 --> 02:15:52.873]  You know, I mean, by fanatics, I mean people that misinterpret it.
[02:15:52.913 --> 02:15:58.658]  Well, look, George Bush calls himself a Christian, but he goes to Skull and Bones, the Bohemian Grove, worships Allah.
[02:15:58.698 --> 02:16:03.401]  The guy's not a Christian, just like he's not a Texan, but people go, oh, look what the Christians are doing.
[02:16:03.601 --> 02:16:05.363]  The New World Order's doing that on purpose.
[02:16:06.043 --> 02:16:09.005]  They mix it together, yeah, to serve their own purposes.
[02:16:09.025 --> 02:16:10.406]  I'll let you talk, Elaine.
[02:16:10.426 --> 02:16:10.887]  Finish up.
[02:16:11.487 --> 02:16:12.828]  Well, I don't know.
[02:16:12.868 --> 02:16:13.829]  I guess I said, but...
[02:16:16.031 --> 02:16:29.185]  I think when you say a lot of good, Alex, when you expose the fact that the government blew up these buildings and whatnot, that's a lot of good that you do, but when you get on to this religious stuff, you just delay...
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:33.923]  Ma'am, I'm trying to get people to think for themselves and to know history.
[02:16:34.703 --> 02:16:35.564]  That's very important.
[02:16:35.584 --> 02:16:38.126]  History has really been buried because of this Bible.
[02:16:38.486 --> 02:16:40.087]  Oh, that's the problem.
[02:16:40.167 --> 02:16:40.847]  I don't agree with you.
[02:16:40.867 --> 02:16:41.468]  Thanks for the call.
[02:16:42.128 --> 02:16:44.610]  Let's talk to Roger in Colorado.
[02:16:44.650 --> 02:16:45.250]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:16:48.913 --> 02:16:49.954]  Roger, you're on the air.
[02:16:51.134 --> 02:16:52.615]  Okay, Roger's gone.
[02:16:53.396 --> 02:16:54.196]  Keith in Rhode Island.
[02:16:54.237 --> 02:16:54.817]  Go ahead, Keith.
[02:16:56.949 --> 02:16:57.249]  Hello?
[02:16:57.769 --> 02:17:04.232]  It sounds like what you and your guests are saying is if you would strip away all the pagan influences in Christianity, you're not left with very much.
[02:17:04.252 --> 02:17:06.873]  That's what they say on the radio a lot of times.
[02:17:07.093 --> 02:17:21.679]  I had a Christian preacher on the radio once that said that if you removed everything that we do, I mean everything that's pagan and what we do, we would be left with nothing because we have abandoned the things that are in the Scriptures.
[02:17:21.719 --> 02:17:23.560]  We've embraced so many other things.
[02:17:24.642 --> 02:17:27.985]  What I'm trying to say here, gentlemen... So they've removed a piece here, a piece there.
[02:17:28.025 --> 02:17:28.365]  Go ahead.
[02:17:28.525 --> 02:17:29.006]  Okay, thanks.
[02:17:29.406 --> 02:17:30.767]  What I'm trying to say... Hello?
[02:17:31.128 --> 02:17:31.368]  Go ahead.
[02:17:31.448 --> 02:17:31.768]  Oh, sorry.
[02:17:31.788 --> 02:17:32.449]  I don't want to interrupt.
[02:17:32.749 --> 02:17:33.710]  I'm the one doing it.
[02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:34.071]  Go ahead.
[02:17:34.211 --> 02:17:34.691]  Okay, thanks.
[02:17:35.412 --> 02:17:41.278]  What I'm trying to say here is that Christianity itself is based on earlier pagan mythology.
[02:17:41.338 --> 02:17:42.619]  If you look at the Christ myths,
[02:17:43.078 --> 02:17:45.661]  It's based on earlier sun god.
[02:17:46.081 --> 02:17:46.682]  No, no, no, no.
[02:17:46.742 --> 02:17:51.087]  The modern fake Christianity is related to it because that's what it is.
[02:17:51.127 --> 02:17:54.751]  You really look at Abraham and Moses and the rest of it.
[02:17:54.791 --> 02:17:55.291]  It's not.
[02:17:55.311 --> 02:17:57.514]  And that's why I disagree with people like Jordan Maxwell.
[02:17:57.934 --> 02:18:02.900]  Well, if you look at the Old Testament, I'm not a Bible expert, but the Old Testament is rife with genocide.
[02:18:03.505 --> 02:18:06.966]  And incest and rape and murder and killing of children.
[02:18:07.006 --> 02:18:09.447]  I mean, is this the kind of religion you really would want to follow?
[02:18:09.467 --> 02:18:12.867]  I mean, is Yahweh really a God worth venerating?
[02:18:13.127 --> 02:18:13.908]  Keith, stay there.
[02:18:13.948 --> 02:18:16.328]  We'll elaborate on this in a final segment with Mr. White.
[02:18:16.348 --> 02:18:17.168]  Take a couple more calls.
[02:18:17.729 --> 02:18:23.970]  I'm Alex Jones, and we'll blitz into the modern news and developments in the final 30 minutes of this transmission.
[02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:27.251]  The websites are prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:18:27.431 --> 02:18:31.032]  And before our guest leaves, we'll tell you how to get his book,
[02:18:32.921 --> 02:18:34.542]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[02:20:05.968 --> 02:20:08.369]  The folks from Miracle 2 don't have to make these claims.

[02:21:31.075 --> 02:21:32.056]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:21:32.136 --> 02:21:36.919]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:21:37.099 --> 02:21:44.904]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:21:45.165 --> 02:21:50.528]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:21:50.748 --> 02:21:57.713]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:21:57.973 --> 02:21:59.133]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:29.301]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:37.805 --> 02:22:39.706]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:22:40.186 --> 02:22:43.027]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:45.889 --> 02:22:47.209]  Just trying to get you to think.
[02:22:47.850 --> 02:22:48.950]  We've got loaded phones here.
[02:22:48.970 --> 02:22:50.031]  We've got to go through these quick.
[02:22:51.471 --> 02:22:52.632]  Keith in Rhode Island.
[02:22:54.119 --> 02:22:58.520]  Continuing with what you were saying, you say you don't really know the Bible, but it's rife with all this.
[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:05.541]  Yes, it's examples of bad things, and how to avoid that in a code of living called the Ten Commandments, which the world is attacking.
[02:23:06.341 --> 02:23:07.802]  So there's an example right there.
[02:23:07.882 --> 02:23:09.422]  But exactly what are you getting at, Keith?
[02:23:09.982 --> 02:23:18.944]  Okay, I guess my point is basically that before Christianity, there were 17 earlier pagan gods who were supposedly born of virgins,
[02:23:19.884 --> 02:23:23.888]  Had apostles, and they were crucified and resurrected and promised to come back one day.
[02:23:24.248 --> 02:23:29.394]  So what I'm saying is basically the Jesus story is basically just a ripoff of earlier pagan myths.
[02:23:30.529 --> 02:23:31.550]  Comments, Mr. White?
[02:23:31.950 --> 02:23:33.531]  Well, that's an old story.
[02:23:33.632 --> 02:23:37.735]  Those writings that he's referring to are things that are not really ancient, though.
[02:23:37.795 --> 02:23:40.297]  They're recently, I mean, over the last several hundred years.
[02:23:40.317 --> 02:23:48.283]  We've got the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation funding section, who then goes and misinterprets now proven Sumerian tablets, and it turns out to be a fraud.
[02:23:48.483 --> 02:23:52.987]  Well, they also wrote a lot of things hundreds of years after the Messiah came.
[02:23:53.367 --> 02:23:55.189]  And these are the sources of these things.
[02:23:55.229 --> 02:23:56.910]  But you see, back in Genesis chapter 3,
[02:23:58.911 --> 02:24:04.095]  The adversary was told that the seed of the woman was going to crush his head.
[02:24:04.395 --> 02:24:08.238]  So he was looking for a male child born of a virgin.
[02:24:08.558 --> 02:24:11.040]  And that's why we see pharaohs and people trying to kill the firstborn.
[02:24:11.060 --> 02:24:11.661]  Thanks for the call.
[02:24:12.001 --> 02:24:16.764]  He set up his artificial framework of paganism very early.
[02:24:17.445 --> 02:24:19.807]  Absolutely.
[02:24:19.927 --> 02:24:21.528]  Who's up next from Ohio there?
[02:24:21.588 --> 02:24:23.709]  No, I guess Roger in Colorado is back.
[02:24:24.270 --> 02:24:25.150]  Roger, go ahead, sir.
[02:24:25.170 --> 02:24:25.711]  You're on the air.
[02:24:26.491 --> 02:24:27.092]  Yes, hi.
[02:24:28.115 --> 02:24:28.795]  Yeah, you're on the air.
[02:24:28.835 --> 02:24:29.135]  Go ahead.
[02:24:29.155 --> 02:24:40.258]  Okay, yeah, I'll just add to that, because they always bring that up, about the other myths, but the gospel was also symbolically known from the constellations.
[02:24:40.278 --> 02:24:48.401]  The story was put there, so the pagan myths were always a copy of that, as I'm sure your guests would know about.
[02:24:48.681 --> 02:24:49.461]  Counterfeits.
[02:24:49.861 --> 02:24:50.461]  Counterfeits.
[02:24:50.561 --> 02:24:51.341]  It's the other way around.
[02:24:51.361 --> 02:24:52.262]  We're not counterfeiting.
[02:24:52.302 --> 02:24:52.662]  They are.
[02:24:53.082 --> 02:24:53.262]  Right.
[02:24:53.302 --> 02:24:56.763]  You know, the story goes back beyond 2,000 years, but it was fulfilled.
[02:24:58.046 --> 02:24:58.386]  Right.
[02:25:00.147 --> 02:25:24.135]  But the other thing I do want to mention, because I've been wanting to correct this a lot, and I think you're carrying it in your book on the sacred names, is I think you're creating some confusion because you have a limited view on the grammar of the Hebrew, but the Greek text is fully inspired.
[02:25:24.955 --> 02:25:26.996]  You're not saying that it's incorrect to say
[02:25:27.492 --> 02:25:31.255]  To translate the Hebrew name of Jesus?
[02:25:31.815 --> 02:25:40.561]  Well, if you look it up in Webster's or a good encyclopedic dictionary, the word J-E-S-U-S is actually rooted from the Hebrew word Yehoshua.
[02:25:40.881 --> 02:25:41.601]  Well, no.
[02:25:42.242 --> 02:25:43.503]  This is why I'm saying it.
[02:25:44.063 --> 02:25:50.067]  You know, if you're implying that the Greek is not inspired because it uses Iesus... Oh, I see what you mean.
[02:25:50.367 --> 02:25:52.928]  Yeah, I think you're bringing confusion and doubt.
[02:25:53.049 --> 02:25:58.071]  This is a long-held debate of whether the... Yeah, I don't want to talk about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
[02:25:58.311 --> 02:26:03.454]  I was just talking about Halloween and Easter and Santa Claus not being Christian.
[02:26:03.514 --> 02:26:04.595]  I think anybody can figure that out.
[02:26:04.615 --> 02:26:04.815]  Thanks.
[02:26:04.835 --> 02:26:09.538]  Well, if you want to get at the root of the Hebraic name controversy, go to sacredscales.com.
[02:26:09.658 --> 02:26:13.500]  Okay, thank you for the call, Roger.
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:15.381]  Who's up next in Ohio?
[02:26:15.401 --> 02:26:17.422]  Who should I go to next?
[02:26:18.345 --> 02:26:19.306]  Kathy in Ohio.
[02:26:19.326 --> 02:26:19.646]  Go ahead.
[02:26:19.666 --> 02:26:21.007]  You're on the air.
[02:26:21.047 --> 02:26:29.412]  Yeah, I wanted to ask your guest if he's a born-again Christian so that I can get some sense of his position and where he stands as far as the Bible goes.
[02:26:30.953 --> 02:26:35.817]  Oh, you mean, am I spirit-filled with the spirit of Yahushua, the one they call Jesus?
[02:26:35.897 --> 02:26:38.538]  I wanted to ask you, are you born-again according to the Scriptures?
[02:26:38.839 --> 02:26:39.079]  Yes.
[02:26:39.939 --> 02:26:43.542]  Okay, well, because your website at fossilizedcustoms.com looks like you're...
[02:26:44.471 --> 02:26:48.795]  Maybe from the Hebrew Roots Movement, which... Well, that's where our Messiah comes from.
[02:26:49.475 --> 02:26:51.697]  The Hebrew Roots is a restoration movement.
[02:26:52.218 --> 02:26:53.539]  Yeah, are you part of that?
[02:26:54.059 --> 02:26:56.421]  Oh, yes, I'm part of restoring the Hebrew Roots.
[02:26:56.962 --> 02:26:58.503]  Well, could I explain that to your listeners?
[02:26:58.523 --> 02:27:00.545]  Because I've done an extensive study on Hebrew Roots.
[02:27:01.726 --> 02:27:05.529]  Jesus was a Jew, and according to... He still is.
[02:27:05.629 --> 02:27:07.571]  Yes, he is, and he's coming again.
[02:27:07.591 --> 02:27:08.892]  And he is the Messiah.
[02:27:09.552 --> 02:27:12.675]  The Hebrew Roots Movement, Alex, and you need to know this,
[02:27:13.197 --> 02:27:15.917]  Well, look, you notice nobody's talking about Halloween or Santa Claus or Ishtar.
[02:27:16.098 --> 02:27:22.859]  Alex, this is important because you're hosting... I understand, but... You're hosting... I want to explain something to you, because it does matter.
[02:27:22.899 --> 02:27:25.319]  You have to know the background of the person you're having.
[02:27:43.061 --> 02:27:43.642]  I've read his book.
[02:27:43.682 --> 02:27:45.583]  I find it to be very accurate and informative.
[02:27:45.663 --> 02:27:46.824]  I know, Alex, but listen.
[02:27:47.064 --> 02:27:47.704]  I'm warning you.
[02:27:48.045 --> 02:27:49.906]  You don't understand what Hebrew Roots Movement is.
[02:27:49.926 --> 02:27:50.646]  You've got to look it up.
[02:27:50.666 --> 02:27:52.728]  They're stealing the promises that belong to the Jews.
[02:27:52.748 --> 02:27:54.189]  The covenant made with the Jews.
[02:27:54.229 --> 02:27:54.829]  No, not at all.
[02:27:54.949 --> 02:27:55.910]  Now, wait a minute.
[02:27:55.970 --> 02:27:56.530]  I've studied it.
[02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:57.351]  Okay, and...
[02:27:59.943 --> 02:28:02.024]  You know what we're going to have to do, Kathy?
[02:28:02.084 --> 02:28:03.744]  We're going to have to break, so, you know.
[02:28:04.284 --> 02:28:04.644]  Okay.
[02:28:04.664 --> 02:28:06.065]  Put her on hold.
[02:28:06.205 --> 02:28:07.705]  She doesn't understand a break.
[02:28:07.725 --> 02:28:08.565]  Kathy, we've got to break.
[02:28:08.925 --> 02:28:09.626]  So I guess what?
[02:28:09.666 --> 02:28:10.486]  Just keep this going.
[02:28:10.506 --> 02:28:16.147]  We'll come back in maybe five more minutes, talk to Kathy, Kevin, and Ken, and then that's it.
[02:28:16.227 --> 02:28:20.088]  Three more calls with our guests, and we'll let you finish up, Kathy.
[02:28:20.108 --> 02:28:20.728]  We've got to break, though.
[02:28:22.208 --> 02:28:23.108]  We're on the march.
[02:28:23.609 --> 02:28:25.109]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:30:33.493 --> 02:30:38.197]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:30:38.498 --> 02:30:39.158]  Yes, it's true.

[02:31:35.951 --> 02:31:41.977]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:31:42.578 --> 02:31:45.601]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:47.523 --> 02:31:49.945]  I've got a whole stack of really important news here.
[02:31:50.286 --> 02:31:56.552]  And I had our guest on today because from reading the encyclopedia, from studying this from college...
[02:31:57.649 --> 02:31:58.270]  None of it's hidden.
[02:31:58.310 --> 02:32:05.095]  It's just never discussed in religious circles that Halloween and Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, it's all occultic and it's taken over Christianity.
[02:32:05.635 --> 02:32:06.656]  That's the point I was making.
[02:32:07.077 --> 02:32:10.419]  Then we get into big fights of this Hebraic movement or the Catholics or this or that.
[02:32:10.499 --> 02:32:16.204]  I'm just trying to get folks to think about what's around us in the world, regardless of what type of Christians we are, or even if you're not a Christian.
[02:32:16.264 --> 02:32:16.684]  I'm a Christian.
[02:32:16.704 --> 02:32:17.305]  I think you should be.
[02:32:17.345 --> 02:32:19.186]  But it's just about knowing history.
[02:32:19.606 --> 02:32:21.508]  Now, Kathy, we had to go to break.
[02:32:21.528 --> 02:32:22.789]  That's why we had to cut you off.
[02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:25.771]  If you're still there, you're back on the air.
[02:32:25.791 --> 02:32:26.611]  Hello?
[02:32:26.832 --> 02:32:27.712]  Yes, yes, hello.
[02:32:28.012 --> 02:32:31.815]  And you guys go ahead and finish up your discussion, you and Lou White.
[02:32:31.835 --> 02:32:32.215]  Go ahead.
[02:32:32.775 --> 02:32:40.481]  I just wanted to say that I've looked at that it does matter what kind of a Christian, because you understand we have false Christians out there, okay?
[02:32:41.021 --> 02:32:45.544]  And we have people that are not adhering to New Testament Christianity that are calling themselves Christians.
[02:32:46.525 --> 02:32:48.626]  And the Hebrew Roots Movement wants to put Christians
[02:32:49.208 --> 02:32:51.689]  Wait a minute.
[02:32:51.729 --> 02:32:59.413]  Christ said that he wasn't there to destroy the law, but to fulfill it and empower it.
[02:32:59.433 --> 02:32:59.893]  You got it.
[02:33:00.013 --> 02:33:02.294]  Now, your guest is right about Halloween and its heathen roots.
[02:33:02.334 --> 02:33:06.236]  He's right about the days of the week, the months of the year, and all the heathenism through the Roman Catholic Church.
[02:33:06.276 --> 02:33:06.716]  He's correct, 100%.
[02:33:06.796 --> 02:33:06.996]  However...
[02:33:09.062 --> 02:33:09.802]  He said some things.
[02:33:09.862 --> 02:33:16.283]  I went to his website, and I found that the ultimate reason is because of the Hebrew Roots Movement.
[02:33:16.303 --> 02:33:18.224]  Now, stay with me, because I'm not anti-Jew.
[02:33:18.244 --> 02:33:19.124]  Well, you keep saying that.
[02:33:19.164 --> 02:33:20.104]  Let's let him address it.
[02:33:20.164 --> 02:33:21.344]  He hasn't gotten a chance to talk.
[02:33:21.384 --> 02:33:21.884]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:33:22.305 --> 02:33:29.166]  Well, the Hebrew Roots are the source of our faith, and Abraham is the father of nations, and I embrace that.
[02:33:29.206 --> 02:33:35.087]  I'm not replacing the tribe of Yehudah, which are called Jews.
[02:33:35.587 --> 02:33:38.310]  We're just another, we're among the lost tribes.
[02:33:38.350 --> 02:33:39.531]  We were born as Gentiles.
[02:33:39.571 --> 02:33:40.552]  We don't know who we are.
[02:33:40.612 --> 02:33:42.694]  We're the prodigal son awakening in the pig pen.
[02:33:43.014 --> 02:33:48.159]  But we're returning to the Torah, the commandments, the Ten Commandments, and we love them now.
[02:33:48.419 --> 02:33:49.420]  And we don't know why.
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:53.223]  But that's not what New Testament, we are not adhering to the Old Testament laws.
[02:33:53.263 --> 02:33:54.605]  The Lord gave us and repeated.
[02:33:54.665 --> 02:33:56.306]  Oh yeah, the commandments are forever.
[02:33:57.167 --> 02:33:59.209]  He repeated every commandment.
[02:33:59.611 --> 02:34:02.812]  In the New Testament, except for, remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy.
[02:34:02.872 --> 02:34:04.693]  I've read my entire Bible multiple times.
[02:34:04.853 --> 02:34:06.073]  The Sabbath is eternal.
[02:34:06.173 --> 02:34:07.274]  It's never going to go away.
[02:34:07.294 --> 02:34:09.294]  See, this is not Christianity.
[02:34:10.415 --> 02:34:13.416]  Okay, hey, Kathy, we'll have to have him on and debate that sometime.
[02:34:13.436 --> 02:34:15.137]  You know, I don't really do a religious show.
[02:34:15.297 --> 02:34:17.757]  Yeah, replacement theology is another subject.
[02:34:17.998 --> 02:34:19.958]  Okay, thank you for the call, Kathy, though.
[02:34:19.978 --> 02:34:21.239]  We did give you a chance to speak.
[02:34:21.299 --> 02:34:22.259]  And send me some info on it.
[02:34:22.859 --> 02:34:24.280]  Kevin in Boston, Mass.
[02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:24.880]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:34:26.442 --> 02:34:26.883]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:34:26.943 --> 02:34:31.765]  I've got just a couple of comments, and I think I'm tying in with more of the theme of what you were talking about.
[02:34:32.285 --> 02:34:38.689]  I agree with that people need to understand the roots of these pagan holidays in order to not be deceived by the New World Order.
[02:34:39.789 --> 02:34:54.957]  And it's part, I think, of their plan to do that, because if people don't understand that, for instance, Christmas was just a day adapted to celebrate Christ's birthday, then they can use that fact, that people's ignorance of that fact,
[02:34:55.393 --> 02:35:08.395]  To say that the Mitzvah was celebrated on the same day, and therefore the belief in Christ is not true, and they can attack Christianity, which is one of the main barriers to them achieving their goals, Judaic Christian values.
[02:35:08.875 --> 02:35:20.257]  And I think that, you know, Mr. White has made some comments, you know, the Church started the Inquisition, killed millions and stuff, and I don't deny the Church's role in that.
[02:35:20.297 --> 02:35:23.538]  I am Catholic, but I think we need to come together to...
[02:35:24.588 --> 02:35:30.550]  I see that the real enemy, even within this topic, is, again, the globalists, even going back.
[02:35:30.610 --> 02:35:40.694]  I've got a bunch of news articles here where it says Catholic groups are out at the forefront of fighting the paganistic system in Halloween.
[02:35:41.554 --> 02:35:47.237]  The Inquisition, the Priory of Sion, which goes back with the Templars, split.
[02:35:47.677 --> 02:35:49.297]  And they were infiltrated.
[02:35:49.377 --> 02:35:51.878]  The Priory of Sion infiltrated the Catholic Church.
[02:35:51.938 --> 02:35:53.359]  They poisoned and killed one pope.
[02:35:53.752 --> 02:36:00.354]  They get, and by threat, that's kind of a threat, they get control of Clements V on behalf of the French King Philip II.
[02:36:00.374 --> 02:36:10.077]  Well, my point has been, about the Catholic Church is, is that it's easy to take over or infiltrate or to have bad cardinals or whatever, and some Catholics say, no, no, no, they're all perfect.
[02:36:10.217 --> 02:36:11.818]  There was even a female pope one time.
[02:36:12.731 --> 02:36:21.275]  Whether it's the Democrats or the Republicans, and you're talking politics, whether you're talking Protestants or Catholics... It's all infiltrated.
[02:36:21.455 --> 02:36:22.435]  We should be aware of that.
[02:36:23.095 --> 02:36:23.576]  Exactly.
[02:36:23.676 --> 02:36:32.880]  And they will, by trying to give you ignorance of the roots of these things, they want to be able to deceive you and manipulate... And it's like this with everything.
[02:36:34.652 --> 02:36:35.272]  Thank you, Kevin.
[02:36:35.292 --> 02:36:36.133]  Comments, Mr. White?
[02:36:36.853 --> 02:36:37.694]  He's exactly right.
[02:36:37.734 --> 02:36:46.040]  The infiltration has been going on since Babylon, and the occultic rituals have been concealed.
[02:36:47.681 --> 02:36:50.343]  Ultimately, the control of the civilization of the world was...
[02:36:51.138 --> 02:36:51.638]  All right, last call.
[02:36:51.678 --> 02:36:52.698]  Ken in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:36:52.718 --> 02:36:53.018]  Yes, Alex.
[02:36:53.058 --> 02:36:53.599]  Very good show.
[02:36:53.619 --> 02:36:54.759]  I haven't called in a while.
[02:36:54.779 --> 02:36:56.039]  A few points that need to be made.
[02:36:56.259 --> 02:36:57.579]  First off, Genesis 5.1 says,
[02:37:20.222 --> 02:37:23.163]  The book was written into the generations of Adam.
[02:37:23.463 --> 02:37:25.383]  Generations translates into race.
[02:37:25.883 --> 02:37:30.344]  And Adam, if you look it up, he was ready, complected, and blessed, read in the faith.
[02:37:31.304 --> 02:37:33.585]  Also, Jacob, Israel.
[02:37:34.945 --> 02:37:37.245]  Israel is not a geographic location.
[02:37:37.305 --> 02:37:38.846]  It's a race of people.
[02:37:39.406 --> 02:37:45.107]  And until we understand this, 200 years ago, every man in this country knew that we were Israel.
[02:37:46.068 --> 02:37:56.434]  And if all fair, I can give a number of a man who has a $1,000 reward to anybody who can prove that Yeshua Messiah was a Jew.
[02:37:57.574 --> 02:38:01.296]  And I can give you that number all fair if your guest would like to contact us.
[02:38:01.316 --> 02:38:03.057]  Well, let's let Mr. White address that.
[02:38:03.998 --> 02:38:06.759]  What was the question about him being a Messiah and being Jewish?
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:14.203]  This man has a $1,000 reward for anybody who can prove that the Messiah was a Jew.
[02:38:15.006 --> 02:38:21.509]  Well, the book of Matthew is one... Well, Jew just means tribe of Judah, doesn't it?
[02:38:21.689 --> 02:38:23.029]  Yeah, Yehudah.
[02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:25.090]  It just means a tribe of people.
[02:38:25.130 --> 02:38:34.294]  I don't get this whole... You know, the Black Panther movement or whatever, they say that they're the real Jews, or you've got this group saying they're the real Jews.
[02:38:34.954 --> 02:38:37.175]  I mean, I thought Christ came for everybody.
[02:38:37.255 --> 02:38:38.115]  There's many tribes.
[02:38:38.716 --> 02:38:39.496]  No, he did not.
[02:38:39.556 --> 02:38:41.797]  He came only for the Adamic race.
[02:38:43.081 --> 02:38:44.081]  Read Genesis 5.1.
[02:38:44.322 --> 02:38:45.502]  This is the big lie.
[02:38:45.962 --> 02:38:52.724]  Well, our Father created all the races of men, and if we put ourselves above another, we're judging him, not them.
[02:38:54.505 --> 02:38:57.146]  He came for the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
[02:38:57.346 --> 02:38:57.866]  That's right.
[02:38:58.106 --> 02:38:58.346]  Yeah.
[02:38:58.907 --> 02:38:59.467]  That's right.
[02:38:59.707 --> 02:39:00.827]  And that's qualified.
[02:39:01.207 --> 02:39:03.668]  And people call me racist for saying that.
[02:39:03.708 --> 02:39:06.549]  Well, I say, take it up with the author.
[02:39:07.509 --> 02:39:08.030]  He wrote it.
[02:39:08.130 --> 02:39:08.930]  And another thing.
[02:39:09.452 --> 02:39:13.519]  All your scriptures that people are studying from are copyrighted.
[02:39:13.980 --> 02:39:17.345]  Who has the authority to copyright the Father's Word?
[02:39:17.726 --> 02:39:18.267]  Good point.
[02:39:18.940 --> 02:39:20.120]  Okay, thank you, Ken.
[02:39:20.681 --> 02:39:27.383]  Thank you for the call, and I want to thank our guest, Lou White, who has written this very, very interesting book.
[02:39:27.423 --> 02:39:33.385]  It's a quick read, 140-something pages long, and it's only $7.95 shipping and handling.
[02:39:33.405 --> 02:39:34.805]  Give that number out for folks who want to get it.
[02:39:35.506 --> 02:39:38.847]  Okay, to get it today shipped to you, you can call 1-877-996.
[02:39:43.513 --> 02:39:45.774]  No, no, I gave you the wrong number.
[02:39:45.814 --> 02:39:46.114]  Hold on.
[02:39:46.154 --> 02:39:47.955]  That's the number to the network, yeah.
[02:39:48.095 --> 02:39:49.495]  That's right.
[02:39:49.655 --> 02:39:54.057]  I've got it upside down.
[02:39:54.277 --> 02:39:54.837]  It's 877-817-9829.
[02:39:54.857 --> 02:39:58.699]  All right, and that's Dave and Joyce who are selling the book for ThePowerHour.com.
[02:39:59.179 --> 02:40:05.641]  Mr. White, the book, Fossilized Customs, and I appreciate you being on the show for two hours.
[02:40:05.781 --> 02:40:06.382]  It was a pleasure.
[02:40:06.502 --> 02:40:06.702]  Thank you.
[02:40:06.722 --> 02:40:07.122]  Take care.
[02:40:07.162 --> 02:40:07.482]  You bet.
[02:40:08.433 --> 02:40:12.036]  I meant to only do that interview for about an hour, but it turned into two hours.
[02:40:12.136 --> 02:40:13.377]  It's about exactly two hours.
[02:40:13.397 --> 02:40:23.385]  We got him on 41 minutes, 42 minutes into the first hour, and here we are in the third hour with about 16, 17 minutes left, and I've got a bunch of news I want to try to run through.
[02:40:23.425 --> 02:40:26.788]  I first want to recap some of the headlines and get into stuff I didn't cover.
[02:40:27.717 --> 02:40:34.100]  But, look, I had him on to talk about Halloween being a pagan holiday and Santa Claus being pagan and all that.
[02:40:34.441 --> 02:40:35.281]  I know that's true.
[02:40:35.361 --> 02:40:37.502]  That's where I start off here, folks.
[02:40:37.542 --> 02:40:40.384]  And I think you just should be aware of that, whether you're Christian or not.
[02:40:40.444 --> 02:40:42.505]  I mean, just why aren't they being honest about it?
[02:40:43.125 --> 02:40:48.768]  Why is almost everything on TV about witches and witchcraft and Wicca and all of this?
[02:40:49.288 --> 02:40:50.869]  So start there, folks.
[02:40:50.949 --> 02:40:51.990]  And that I know is true.
[02:40:52.660 --> 02:40:58.324]  And I'm not going to get into a big, giant debate arguing with all these different sects of Christianity fighting with each other.
[02:40:58.925 --> 02:41:00.546]  It just drives me up a wall.
[02:41:01.106 --> 02:41:03.528]  But I know I'll get boxes of letters on this subject.
[02:41:03.568 --> 02:41:05.129]  I'll try to look at all of it.
[02:41:05.189 --> 02:41:06.010]  My head is spinning.
[02:41:06.650 --> 02:41:07.351]  My head is spinning.
[02:41:07.951 --> 02:41:09.272]  I just know what the New World Order is.
[02:41:09.292 --> 02:41:09.952]  I know what it's up to.
[02:41:09.972 --> 02:41:10.673]  I know it's a cult.
[02:41:11.253 --> 02:41:13.775]  I know they worship Lucifer, and that's a fact.
[02:41:14.335 --> 02:41:17.618]  And I know they hate Christians and have tried to infiltrate it and take it over, so...
[02:41:18.979 --> 02:41:19.902]  That's where that stands.
[02:41:19.922 --> 02:41:26.380]  Let me recap some of the incredible headlines, then we'll get into a stack of other news we have not covered yet in this show.
[02:41:27.777 --> 02:41:35.585]  As a sub-caveat of that, if you have not gotten my new video, The Matrix of Evil, folks, it is $25.95, over two hours.
[02:41:35.706 --> 02:41:44.895]  Ron Paul, Colonel Craig Roberts, Frank Morales, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, myself, excerpts of speeches we've all given, interviews, questions.
[02:41:44.995 --> 02:41:49.220]  Ron Paul talks about the New World Order running Washington, the global depression the bankers are setting up.
[02:41:50.054 --> 02:41:51.475]  That's roughly an $18 discount, what...
[02:42:20.419 --> 02:42:20.999]  17.85 discount.
[02:42:21.259 --> 02:42:24.561]  When you get three videos, $24 discount if you get four, and so on.
[02:42:25.162 --> 02:42:26.883]  I published a new book, Order Out of Chaos.
[02:42:26.943 --> 02:42:27.383]  It's great.
[02:42:28.003 --> 02:42:29.304]  My book's Descent into Tyranny.

[02:42:41.852 --> 02:42:44.173]  And secondarily, your purchases support this show.
[02:42:44.213 --> 02:42:48.236]  I want to thank those that have gotten the videos and the books, and I hope you'll keep doing it and getting it out to people.

[02:43:29.838 --> 02:43:35.220]  And last but not least is the mailing address for those that like to order stuff that way.
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:36.600]  It's Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 101.
[02:43:48.544 --> 02:43:49.245]  Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:43:49.605 --> 02:43:53.089]  So take action, and don't wait on that.
[02:43:53.109 --> 02:43:54.050]  Your support is needed.
[02:43:55.051 --> 02:43:57.834]  Barbara Bush threatens presidential candidates.
[02:43:58.134 --> 02:43:59.315]  That's the headline.
[02:44:00.256 --> 02:44:10.647]  And Barbara Bush, and this is a quote, you can criticize me, but don't criticize my children, and don't criticize my daughters-in-law, and don't criticize my husband or your dad.
[02:44:11.508 --> 02:44:16.450]  We have the Larry King transcript, a link to the Larry King transcript from October 22nd.
[02:44:16.570 --> 02:44:18.310]  A listener emailed me this last night.
[02:44:18.751 --> 02:44:22.672]  We went and checked it out on Larry King's website at CNN, and it is true.
[02:44:23.292 --> 02:44:31.115]  And if you or I said this, we'd have Secret Service at our door because the presidential candidates, the Democrats, are under Secret Service protection.
[02:44:31.135 --> 02:44:32.876]  I hope you'll email this story out to people.
[02:44:32.896 --> 02:44:33.516]  It's very interesting.
[02:44:33.816 --> 02:44:35.617]  On the global government subject, we're on that daily.
[02:44:37.077 --> 02:44:39.639]  One of the justices on the Supreme Court, U.S.
[02:44:39.679 --> 02:44:45.684]  must rely on foreign law, goes on to say we should follow the rulings of the United Nations.
[02:44:46.124 --> 02:44:52.749]  More on that, also out of the day, big newspaper in Connecticut, Navy's top officer calls for a global naval force.
[02:44:53.619 --> 02:44:56.100]  Clark outlined strategy for combating terrorism.
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:45:04.724]  Also, Chief of Navy Operations Admiral Vern Clark described a proposal for a maritime NORAD merging our militaries.
[02:45:04.744 --> 02:45:07.366]  And here's another one out of the international news.
[02:45:07.506 --> 02:45:09.747]  Russia may join NATO to fight common enemy.
[02:45:10.087 --> 02:45:11.768]  Talking about that, it's already happened.
[02:45:11.788 --> 02:45:12.388]  Merging us.
[02:45:13.900 --> 02:45:15.381]  And now they're going to do it publicly.
[02:45:16.161 --> 02:45:18.401]  Also, this is from the Sunshine Project.
[02:45:18.842 --> 02:45:21.863]  Lethal viruses from 1918 genetically reconstructed.
[02:45:22.483 --> 02:45:22.783]  U.S.
[02:45:22.943 --> 02:45:25.284]  Army scientists create Spanish flu virus.
[02:45:25.324 --> 02:45:27.464]  It killed, they say, 20 to 40 million.
[02:45:27.504 --> 02:45:28.065]  No one knows.
[02:45:28.125 --> 02:45:29.265]  It's at least over 30 million.
[02:45:30.054 --> 02:45:30.555]  We're good to go.
[02:45:47.731 --> 02:45:56.314]  Big article here getting into the mouse pox or the super weaponized system, and they can do this for any mammal.
[02:45:56.414 --> 02:46:04.117]  It kills everyone that it comes in contact with, even if you've had a vaccine or if you're on antiviral medications.
[02:46:04.177 --> 02:46:12.240]  It kills all cows, all mice, and they said they can make it for human beings, and they published two years ago the findings of this on the Internet of how to do it.
[02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:13.801]  The Australian scientists, now the U.S.
[02:46:13.841 --> 02:46:16.262]  government, is involved in that.
[02:46:17.170 --> 02:46:20.613]  I'm trying to find my article on that, my new scientist article.
[02:46:21.014 --> 02:46:27.019]  I did find the Gainesville Sun article, Vaccine Evading Mousepox Virus Created.
[02:46:27.039 --> 02:46:27.700]  It wasn't created.
[02:46:27.720 --> 02:46:29.161]  It was created two years ago, but now the U.S.
[02:46:29.201 --> 02:46:30.302]  government's made their own version.
[02:46:30.783 --> 02:46:39.811]  A research team backed by a federal grant has created a genetically engineered mousepox virus designed to evade vaccines, highlighting the deadly potential for biotechnology and bioterrorism.
[02:46:41.027 --> 02:46:49.250]  The new scientist article is even more revealing, and that is posted on infowars.com.
[02:46:49.810 --> 02:46:52.271]  So I hope you'll go check that out.
[02:46:52.291 --> 02:46:59.173]  We've got a bunch of mainstream news articles about the pagan background of Sam Haines, Salwin.
[02:46:59.874 --> 02:47:00.874]  You know it is Halloween.
[02:47:00.894 --> 02:47:02.034]  You'll want to go check that out.
[02:47:02.454 --> 02:47:07.576]  Also, Ashcroft visit expected to generate area protests.
[02:47:07.616 --> 02:47:09.697]  This is also out of the Gainesville Sun.
[02:47:10.746 --> 02:47:18.348]  And this is very, very serious because all over the place where he goes, despite the fact of his PR campaign, people are not going along with it.
[02:47:18.748 --> 02:47:23.669]  From Florida to Texas to Connecticut to New York to California to Missouri.
[02:47:24.829 --> 02:47:26.350]  Salt Lake City has a big article.
[02:47:26.430 --> 02:47:37.192]  Bush is determined to undo more liberty under Patriot Act when pressed over whether Laker star Colby Bryant should continue playing basketball while the issue of his alleged sexual assault is under investigation.
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:45.767]  By the courts, NBA Commissioner David Stern told the Los Angeles Times, absolutely, we don't have a Patriot Act in the NBA.
[02:47:46.167 --> 02:47:59.760]  It appears that the repressive nature of the USA Patriot Act, which is two years old on Sunday, has penetrated the American consciousness to such an extent that it now stands as shorthand parlay for any type of unfairness, spite.
[02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:06.322]  Attorney General John Ashcroft's barnstorming tour of the country, selling the act of friendly audiences and law enforcement.
[02:48:06.862 --> 02:48:12.143]  Nearly 200 communities, it's over 400, including three states, have now passed resolutions objecting to its excesses.
[02:48:13.624 --> 02:48:22.286]  Rumsfeld wants a ministry of truth, and this article gets into his speeches where he says we need an agency in the government that controls the media and puts out the truth.
[02:48:23.463 --> 02:48:26.846]  Security services on high terrorist alert for Bush's British tour.
[02:48:27.406 --> 02:48:28.347]  You don't have to worry, Bush.
[02:48:28.367 --> 02:48:30.068]  None of your terrorists are going to carry out any terror.
[02:48:30.829 --> 02:48:33.030]  Anti-war hecklers ruffle Bush's hawk.
[02:48:33.070 --> 02:48:42.837]  It says that Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz became shaken and got into heated arguments as students at a university stood up and asked him questions about Iraq.
[02:48:42.857 --> 02:48:46.600]  It says he got more upset about that than the rocket attack on him of Monday.
[02:48:48.061 --> 02:48:49.201]  Two killed in Baghdad.
[02:48:49.441 --> 02:48:51.922]  Fire as bomb explosion hits U.S.
[02:48:51.962 --> 02:48:52.442]  military.
[02:48:52.482 --> 02:48:53.863]  There's been three explosions now.
[02:48:53.883 --> 02:48:55.883]  They're trying to say it's gas pipes going off.
[02:48:55.903 --> 02:48:56.403]  Yeah, right.
[02:48:57.824 --> 02:48:59.544]  Also, study links U.S.
[02:48:59.584 --> 02:49:02.705]  reconstruction deals to Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Bush backers.
[02:49:03.545 --> 02:49:05.046]  Study links, AFP.
[02:49:05.486 --> 02:49:07.686]  Just read the financial filings of Halliburton.
[02:49:08.226 --> 02:49:11.567]  They're talking about bankrupting Halliburton now so the stockholders won't even get anything.
[02:49:11.607 --> 02:49:13.588]  It'll be put into a dummy corporation.
[02:49:14.187 --> 02:49:18.793]  We'll blitz through final news in the final segment on the other side of this quick break.
[02:49:19.253 --> 02:49:20.074]  Please stay with us.
[02:49:20.135 --> 02:49:21.016]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:49:21.476 --> 02:49:23.819]  My job is to get you thinking outside the box.
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:25.061]  Learn history.
[02:49:25.521 --> 02:49:26.603]  Learn about freedom.
[02:49:27.083 --> 02:49:28.084]  Stand up against tyranny.
[02:49:28.385 --> 02:49:31.549]  We'll be right back on the other side of this Halloween transmission.
[02:49:33.223 --> 02:49:37.568]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:37.748 --> 02:49:42.172]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:42.333 --> 02:49:46.697]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:49:46.737 --> 02:49:48.079]  The New World Order.
[02:49:49.872 --> 02:49:54.094]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:54.154 --> 02:50:01.096]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:50:01.216 --> 02:50:03.257]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:50:03.617 --> 02:50:06.678]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[02:50:06.838 --> 02:50:13.940]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:50:14.220 --> 02:50:19.581]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:50:20.101 --> 02:50:22.742]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:50:22.842 --> 02:50:24.002]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:50:24.022 --> 02:50:24.282]  That's 888.
[02:50:28.183 --> 02:50:28.823]  253-3139.
[02:50:28.924 --> 02:50:32.226]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:50:32.626 --> 02:50:40.132]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[02:50:40.412 --> 02:50:53.402]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:50:53.682 --> 02:50:56.985]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:57.325 --> 02:51:07.787]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:51:08.067 --> 02:51:08.567]  That's right.
[02:51:08.748 --> 02:51:15.869]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:51:16.169 --> 02:51:20.230]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter.
[02:51:20.490 --> 02:51:21.010]  Oh my God!
[02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:26.413]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:51:38.820 --> 02:51:39.461]  Yes, it's true.
[02:51:39.581 --> 02:51:42.264]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:51:42.404 --> 02:51:46.429]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills and Viagra.
[02:51:46.549 --> 02:51:47.090]  You heard it right.
[02:51:47.270 --> 02:51:52.315]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief and heartburn relief.
[02:51:52.436 --> 02:51:53.457]  The list goes on and on.
[02:51:53.697 --> 02:51:54.017]  We're good to go.
[02:52:10.836 --> 02:52:11.757]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[02:52:11.777 --> 02:52:12.598]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[02:52:46.767 --> 02:52:52.632]  Alright folks, final segment of the show, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central and back from 9 to Midnight Central.
[02:52:53.993 --> 02:52:56.956]  Walmart, no stranger to illegal contract work.
[02:52:57.796 --> 02:52:59.077]  It's out of Florida today.
[02:52:59.998 --> 02:53:02.740]  Last week's arrest may implicate executives.
[02:53:03.721 --> 02:53:06.183]  And it just details, if you want to find out, it's on the websites.
[02:53:07.104 --> 02:53:08.145]  If you want to find out...
[02:53:08.797 --> 02:53:18.784]  I mean, basically the whole infrastructure is supported by illegal aliens, and it does go up to the executives, despite the fact they try to insulate themselves with subcontractors, which is called racketeering.
[02:53:18.804 --> 02:53:23.427]  There's a bunch of other instances of it all over the country.
[02:53:24.188 --> 02:53:28.671]  Also, an article on Prison Planet, Freemasons prompt child ID chip.
[02:53:29.856 --> 02:53:37.661]  And it says the Shirley PTA and the Massachusetts Freemasons will present the Child Identification Program Saturday, November 8th from 10 a.m.
[02:53:37.761 --> 02:53:38.162]  to 10 p.m.
[02:53:38.202 --> 02:53:39.963]  at the Laura A. White School.
[02:53:40.423 --> 02:53:43.885]  The Masonic Chip Program is the most comprehensive service of its kind anywhere.
[02:53:44.906 --> 02:53:49.369]  And it goes on to talk about how they want to get fingerprints, face scans.
[02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:51.130]  And, you know, they say microchips are good, too.
[02:53:51.710 --> 02:53:52.851]  And then friendly of them.
[02:53:52.991 --> 02:53:54.172]  Just lots of little programs.
[02:53:54.918 --> 02:54:01.322]  Imagine if they had made a science fiction movie 20 years ago in 2003 where they had the groups meeting to make us take chips.
[02:54:01.382 --> 02:54:02.463]  I mean, it's sick, folks.
[02:54:03.243 --> 02:54:05.825]  Rolling use of private police network raises concerns.
[02:54:05.905 --> 02:54:18.173]  USA Today, I could have spent an hour on this, it's out of Minnesota, and it says that for years the police have been getting all your records, divorce, police reports.
[02:54:19.148 --> 02:54:23.572]  On the victims, everything, putting it into a database about you, where you work, what you do.
[02:54:23.632 --> 02:54:28.696]  It turns out it's the matrix system hooked into the federal government, and they're going to give it to private groups now.
[02:54:28.836 --> 02:54:32.839]  And it's also, they're doing this with juveniles.
[02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:40.025]  So juveniles, all your records, just big police records on everybody, spy files right out in the open, federally paid for.
[02:54:41.008 --> 02:54:44.631]  And a judge to Christian mom, no homophobic teaching, we're on that daily.
[02:54:45.111 --> 02:54:52.737]  In a custody case, orders child religious upbringing must not expose her to the idea of homosexuality is wrong.
[02:54:53.138 --> 02:54:57.761]  The judge's order says, quote, no discussion and no teaching of homophobia.
[02:54:58.262 --> 02:55:00.644]  Well, homophobia is a made-up term, folks.
[02:55:00.664 --> 02:55:03.546]  I mean, you can teach your children whatever you want, but again...
[02:55:04.355 --> 02:55:05.015]  We're good to go.
[02:55:35.456 --> 02:55:42.639]  There's a big lawsuit getting filed in England where they had one of these reality shows where these guys thought they were trying to marry this good-looking woman.
[02:55:42.659 --> 02:55:44.080]  It turns out it was a transvestite.
[02:55:44.420 --> 02:55:47.601]  Ha ha, it's real funny.
[02:55:47.661 --> 02:55:51.103]  Stop trying to put your morality on us.
[02:55:51.163 --> 02:55:52.143]  You're the ones pushing it.
[02:55:52.183 --> 02:55:53.304]  You're the aggressive people.
[02:55:55.023 --> 02:55:55.924]  Folks, I'm out of time.
[02:55:55.944 --> 02:55:58.328]  There's a lot of news we didn't get to, but we did cover a ton of it.
[02:55:58.368 --> 02:56:04.177]  I just can't get over Barbara Bush on Larry King saying, if you criticize my family, quote, you're dead.
[02:56:05.649 --> 02:56:06.209]  She said that.
[02:56:06.249 --> 02:56:08.651]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[02:56:08.731 --> 02:56:13.154]  And the bigger story than that is the super mouse pox that kills all mice.
[02:56:13.635 --> 02:56:15.136]  They got a cow pox that kills all cows.
[02:56:15.176 --> 02:56:16.216]  Our government's developing it.
[02:56:16.717 --> 02:56:17.917]  Hundreds of gallons of it.
[02:56:18.378 --> 02:56:19.939]  And saying, brace for the attack.
[02:56:20.119 --> 02:56:21.780]  And think of the tyranny, the control.
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:23.561]  They'll get out of a system like this.
[02:56:23.942 --> 02:56:28.565]  And they say they're going to get their global government, their world microchip population.
[02:56:29.005 --> 02:56:33.028]  After these releases, people will do anything to, quote, keep us safer to get the cures.
[02:56:33.835 --> 02:56:37.678]  This is their red carpet, their yellow brick road to get total control.
[02:56:38.258 --> 02:56:39.159]  We've got to say no.
[02:56:39.259 --> 02:56:44.462]  We've got to educate people of who has a history of biological testing on the population of this planet.
[02:56:46.604 --> 02:56:58.932]  Again, folks, I'll be back Monday, 11 to 2 Central Time during the day at 12.172 and 9320 on the shortwave or your AM or FM station or the Internet at GCNlive.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:56:59.676 --> 02:57:02.317]  I'll be back tonight from 9 to midnight, Global Shortwave at 5.085, 6890.
[02:57:02.377 --> 02:57:05.339]  Tell your friends to tune in.
[02:57:05.419 --> 02:57:08.561]  We're going to re-air that interview with Mr. White.
[02:57:09.461 --> 02:57:13.503]  And we'll be back tomorrow with a show I do with John Stattmiller from 1 to 4.
[02:57:14.063 --> 02:57:15.284]  That's called Real Talk Radio.
[02:57:16.044 --> 02:57:22.328]  I'm out of time for this transmission, but again, I'll see you back on Monday and back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:57:22.368 --> 02:57:23.008]  Have a great weekend.
[02:57:23.602 --> 02:57:34.255]  The Berkey Lights unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available in the world.
