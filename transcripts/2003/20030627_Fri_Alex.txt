[00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:14.483]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.684 --> 00:00:15.364]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:17.105]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:18.927]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:20.308]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:21.993]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.013 --> 00:00:26.614]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:30.955]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:50.500]  Welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show, where we talk about real issues that actually affect
[00:00:51.574 --> 00:01:04.905]  You and your family, where we expose the real political paradigm here on this show, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day, and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:11.791]  The websites are Infowars.net, Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:14.734]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, Colorado...
[00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.891]  We're good to go.
[00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:17.232]  I think?
[00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:58.721]  Run around with ID cards issued by their governments, Guatemala, Mexico, Poland, China, and dozens of other countries, and then cities, socialistic cities that want to destroy our sovereignty and want to balkanize this country and drive down wages and want third world populations that are easy to control.
[00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.955]  The cities then accept these matricula cards.
[00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:04.956]  Of course, we talk about matricula.
[00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:07.538]  That's the government-issued Mexican ID card.
[00:02:07.558 --> 00:02:09.739]  But now many other governments are doing the same thing.
[00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.022]  So he's got a bill to try to stop this, and it's good news.
[00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:20.866]  So the Colorado Senate President, John Andrews, will be joining us here in about 28 1⁄2 minutes.
[00:02:23.607 --> 00:02:26.089]  That is kind of an immigration show today.
[00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:42.182]  We've got Glenn Spencer of American Patrol coming on the show, the preeminent organization telling the truth about the New World Order plan to destroy our sovereignty by getting rid of the borders.
[00:02:42.242 --> 00:02:44.644]  If you don't have borders, you don't have a country.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:03:00.812]  So we'll go inside the story and what's behind the headlines and document the latest information as we track the criminal activities of the New World Order for you here on the show on the 27th of June 2003.
[00:03:03.194 --> 00:03:07.717]  In the meantime, the news is getting more and more crazy, more and more out of control.
[00:03:07.817 --> 00:03:11.140]  I'm going to try to race through it for you.
[00:03:13.642 --> 00:03:15.243]  Colorado Senator, again,
[00:03:16.016 --> 00:03:18.278]  President of the Senate coming up and Glenn Spencer.
[00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.659]  A U.S.
[00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:22.560]  Senator, the oldest U.S.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.302]  Senator, the longest serving U.S.
[00:03:25.342 --> 00:03:30.145]  Senator, who just left office last year, died this morning.
[00:03:30.806 --> 00:03:31.667]  Former U.S.
[00:03:31.707 --> 00:03:34.128]  Senator Strom Thurmond dies.
[00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.751]  Strom Thurmond, the longest serving Senator in U.S.
[00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:39.071]  history, died Thursday.
[00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:39.912]  He was 100.
[00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:45.696]  So he died in the, I guess, early morning hours yesterday.
[00:03:47.558 --> 00:03:49.639]  Again, Thurman died at 9.45 p.m.
[00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:57.423]  local time in a hospital in his hometown of Edgar Field, said his son Strom Thurman Jr.
[00:03:58.123 --> 00:04:05.026]  He served as a senator from South Carolina for 48 years as both a Democrat and later as a Republican.
[00:04:06.627 --> 00:04:13.490]  Strom Thurman was attacked viciously and endlessly because he wasn't a Democrat and he wasn't a Klan member.
[00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:15.071]  So he was called a racist.
[00:04:15.471 --> 00:04:16.532]  If you're a Klan member...
[00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:22.263]  If you hate black people, if you try to exterminate them, you're called a liberal.
[00:04:23.424 --> 00:04:26.885]  You're called a right-wing extremist if you care about black people.
[00:04:28.106 --> 00:04:29.547]  And so he was attacked.
[00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:32.428]  Again, George Bush is called a conservative.
[00:04:32.488 --> 00:04:35.049]  He is the most liberal creature I've ever seen.
[00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.792]  Gun-grabbing, open borders, supercomputers, blocking Dan Burton's committee, getting rid of the Bill of Rights.
[00:04:40.932 --> 00:04:42.233]  He's called a conservative.
[00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:45.014]  But in reality, he's a liberal.
[00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:49.955]  Again, I'm just showing you how all these terms are scrambled and the double standards.
[00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:53.878]  And of course, I'm speaking of Senator Robert Byrd from West Virginia.
[00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:56.440]  Look, I'm not going to get off into this too long.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.982]  I'll give you a little bit more details of that.
[00:04:58.282 --> 00:04:59.963]  The really serious news is coming up.
[00:05:00.504 --> 00:05:02.105]  And believe me, you don't want to miss it.
[00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:03.907]  I don't have time to tell you what it concerns.
[00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:05.868]  But you'll find out when we get back.
[00:05:05.948 --> 00:05:07.049]  It's very important.
[00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:08.511]  Infowars.com
[00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:17.734]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:05:17.954 --> 00:05:20.215]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:05:20.395 --> 00:05:26.757]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:27.738]  We're good to go.
[00:05:47.418 --> 00:05:52.260]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:06:09.338 --> 00:06:13.683]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:13.863 --> 00:06:18.289]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.794]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:22.854 --> 00:06:24.216]  The New World Order.
[00:06:25.996 --> 00:06:30.198]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:30.278 --> 00:06:37.202]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:37.322 --> 00:06:39.423]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:39.723 --> 00:06:50.169]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:52.890]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my

[00:07:08.718 --> 00:07:09.119]  We're good to go.
[00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:09.419]  I think?
[00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:24.135]  We're good to go.
[00:07:50.834 --> 00:07:55.497]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[00:07:55.737 --> 00:07:59.660]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.041]  Call the Ark Institute today.

[00:08:10.974 --> 00:08:13.156]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:13.736 --> 00:08:16.578]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:38.233]  I again thank you for joining me on this show.
[00:08:39.093 --> 00:08:45.084]  Live Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show, and of course, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:46.205 --> 00:08:46.907]  Former U.S.
[00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:49.070]  Senator Strom Thurmond dies.
[00:08:49.847 --> 00:08:52.810]  Strom Thurmond, the longest-serving senator in U.S.
[00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.372]  history, died Thursday night.
[00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:55.732]  He was 100.
[00:08:55.772 --> 00:08:59.576]  Thurmond died at 9.45 p.m.
[00:08:59.636 --> 00:09:06.282]  local time in a hospital in his hometown of Edgar Field, said his son, Strom Thurmond Jr.
[00:09:06.802 --> 00:09:13.008]  He served as a senator from South Carolina for 48 years as both a Democrat and later as a Republican.
[00:09:13.488 --> 00:09:14.008]  We're good to go.
[00:09:14.068 --> 00:09:14.489]  I think?
[00:09:35.337 --> 00:09:58.232]  And at the retirement dinner that I just so happened to watch on C-SPAN before the firestorm began over the Senate Majority Leader's comments, Trent Lott's comments, the cheerleader from Louisiana's comments about how Strom Thurmond would have made a great president.
[00:10:00.293 --> 00:10:01.054]  Now, look...
[00:10:02.412 --> 00:10:10.258]  People can attack Strom Thurmond on whatever issues they want, but his segregationist views, my friends, were in 1957.
[00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:18.145]  Now, back at that time, Senator Byrd was running around with a white hood on his head.
[00:10:20.006 --> 00:10:22.788]  And, of course, he's one of the senior Democrats in the Senate.
[00:10:23.209 --> 00:10:26.711]  So, I'm just tired of the double standards.
[00:10:26.752 --> 00:10:30.915]  I don't want to get off into a big discussion about this, because it is a diversion.
[00:10:31.656 --> 00:10:32.376]  I think we're good to go.
[00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.771]  Vulcanizing, shattering effect of the society.
[00:10:56.811 --> 00:10:58.592]  That's what multiculturalism really is.
[00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:04.854]  It's just immunizing, destroying any heritage that any group has.
[00:11:05.854 --> 00:11:16.138]  And it's just as damaging to focus on it, saying it's good, as it is to endlessly focus on it and say it's all bad because we all get obsessed with it.
[00:11:16.798 --> 00:11:21.220]  And it actually just continues this whole mindless...
[00:11:22.638 --> 00:11:24.019]  Discussion that's going on.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.881]  I'll give you an example.
[00:11:26.081 --> 00:11:29.043]  Grace is red herring for neocons.
[00:11:29.704 --> 00:11:42.795]  They don't want to talk about how Bush is going to sign the assault weapons ban and add to it a ban on all semi-automatic shotguns and taxes on ammo and shutting down gun shows and registering all gun owners.
[00:11:42.975 --> 00:11:43.976]  They don't want to mention that.
[00:11:44.016 --> 00:11:44.736]  It's official.
[00:11:45.056 --> 00:11:49.320]  The NRA admitted it a few months ago in their legislative alert section of their website.
[00:11:50.538 --> 00:12:03.462]  A lot of you couldn't believe it when I read the bill on air, but finally you could when the NRA put out an alert and said, yeah, it'll ban shotguns, all semi-automatic shotguns, shutdown gun shows, National Ballistics Database, on and on and on.
[00:12:04.803 --> 00:12:06.784]  So the neocons don't want to talk about that.
[00:12:06.824 --> 00:12:07.804]  They're not going to talk about it.
[00:12:07.824 --> 00:12:11.345]  They won't talk about how Bush didn't want to arm any of the pilots.
[00:12:12.005 --> 00:12:14.026]  Then Barbara Boxer wanted to arm all of them.
[00:12:14.306 --> 00:12:15.146]  Who's the liberal?
[00:12:16.187 --> 00:12:19.828]  They don't want to talk about Pardon Gate or Missile Gate or China Gate or...
[00:12:20.942 --> 00:12:24.263]  Patriot Act, gay, they don't want to talk about any of this stuff.
[00:12:25.183 --> 00:12:43.648]  So they focus, they hyperventilate about what Barbara Streisand's doing, or what Al Gore said, or what Hillary Clinton's doing, and they endlessly promote everything Hillary Clinton sells, her stupid book that I wouldn't use as birdcage whiner.
[00:12:43.828 --> 00:12:45.989]  I wouldn't read it if you paid me to.
[00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:48.150]  I've read some of the excerpts, though, online.
[00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.350]  I mean, you talk about lies.
[00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:52.210]  It goes on and on.
[00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:59.434]  And then the liberals will also attack the conservatives in the same little backroom deal promoting their books, like this Ann Coulter.
[00:13:00.995 --> 00:13:02.897]  So they don't want to talk about real issues.
[00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:07.620]  They'll just focus all day on what Jesse Jackson said or what some other liberal did.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.700]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:18.407]  Because when it comes to substance, when it comes to action, not rhetoric, but substance, you know, the neocons' boss, Stalin, said that...
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.381]  Well, words are one thing, actions another.
[00:13:23.461 --> 00:13:33.108]  So I look at actions, and the actions are the destruction of America, big government on steroids, the annihilation of what that fly represents.
[00:13:33.168 --> 00:13:40.492]  But the general public buys into the surface debate, the surface statements of the neocons.
[00:13:40.572 --> 00:13:42.794]  And it's all about how dumb the liberals are.
[00:13:43.334 --> 00:13:47.917]  But then you find Hillary Clinton together with Bush on not wanting to arm the pilots.
[00:13:48.177 --> 00:13:50.338]  Together with Bush on invading Iraq.
[00:13:50.818 --> 00:13:53.800]  Together with Bush on giving supercomputers to Communist China.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.381]  Together with Bush on blocking Dan Burton's committee.
[00:13:56.682 --> 00:13:58.823]  Together with Bush on the assault weapons ban.
[00:13:59.043 --> 00:14:01.344]  Together with Bush on private land grabs.
[00:14:01.584 --> 00:14:11.330]  Together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, on all the key issues of putting in the cameras and putting in the highway checkpoints and...
[00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.691]  Standardizing the surveillance systems.
[00:14:15.852 --> 00:14:16.572]  It's all there.
[00:14:16.632 --> 00:14:17.912]  It's the same actions.
[00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:27.556]  So this whole debate that will now start again over Strom Thurmond, Trent Lott, there'll be no discussion of Byrd riding around on his horse with his Klan hood on.
[00:14:27.576 --> 00:14:29.777]  That's okay.
[00:14:30.717 --> 00:14:32.458]  You know, the liberals love Margaret Sanger.
[00:14:32.518 --> 00:14:36.059]  I mean, the woman got awards from Hitler, gave awards to Hitler.
[00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:39.200]  If you just say you're a liberal, you can run around with a Nazi armband on.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.261]  Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood.
[00:14:43.021 --> 00:14:46.042]  So these people are all in the same grouping together.
[00:14:46.642 --> 00:14:49.963]  It's just, will the establishment decide to attack you?
[00:14:50.963 --> 00:14:59.805]  And Bush had already reprimanded Trent Lott and told him to stop trying to pass a ban on partial birth abortion in the Senate.
[00:15:00.305 --> 00:15:05.807]  They wanted to have a staged event in the House and then have it never get to Bush's desk where he'd be forced to sign it.
[00:15:06.733 --> 00:15:10.036]  I have a Fox News story where Bush told him, stop bringing that up for a vote.
[00:15:10.817 --> 00:15:11.998]  That's not your prerogative.
[00:15:12.038 --> 00:15:13.659]  You follow the White House's orders.
[00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:19.644]  So that's the only reason Bush turned his back on Trent Lott, his little cheerleader buddy.
[00:15:19.664 --> 00:15:22.186]  They were both cheerleaders, male cheerleaders.
[00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:24.088]  That's bad enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:24.128 --> 00:15:26.850]  Don't trust any male cheerleaders.
[00:15:27.931 --> 00:15:33.656]  Shempering, effeminate, New World Order, skull and bones, twits.
[00:15:35.379 --> 00:15:36.260]  All right, continuing.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.163]  Certainly don't trust anybody from Kennebuckport, Maine, who affects a fake Texas accent.
[00:15:41.263 --> 00:15:50.088]  It would be like if I went up there to Blue Blood Country and affected the Atlantic accent, you know, the wannabe British accent they have.
[00:15:51.129 --> 00:15:55.291]  Saw an old reel of Prescott Bush speaking in his British accent.
[00:15:56.232 --> 00:15:58.874]  Oh, yeah, this is excellent.
[00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:00.895]  On the floor of the Senate.
[00:16:01.915 --> 00:16:05.337]  I've seen George W. shift back into his real accent before.
[00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:14.843]  He'll kind of falter and, well, I'll tell you, I mean, let me get back into my Texas accent hair for you, boy!
[00:16:14.863 --> 00:16:18.084]  Oh, goodness, I'm switching back into my real accent.
[00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:20.526]  Oh, let me tell you!
[00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:22.467]  You like fakeness?
[00:16:22.507 --> 00:16:23.688]  You like being lied to?
[00:16:23.728 --> 00:16:26.389]  You like being told one plus one equals three?
[00:16:26.409 --> 00:16:28.951]  Well, this isn't the show for you.
[00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:30.852]  You want to turn your shotguns in
[00:16:31.716 --> 00:16:33.116]  You want more regulation?
[00:16:33.136 --> 00:16:34.337]  Then knock yourselves out.
[00:16:36.137 --> 00:16:39.138]  You want gun control and tyranny and slavery and no freedom?
[00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:44.159]  Then Bush and Gore and all the rest of them and John Kerry, Mr. Skull and Bones are for you.
[00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:53.180]  By the way, we do have the President of the Colorado Senate, President John Andrews, scheduled to join us.
[00:16:53.501 --> 00:17:00.562]  He's calling in to talk about trying to stop all the illegals in the cities accepting fake ID cards, basically, the matricula.
[00:17:01.474 --> 00:17:02.234]  So former U.S.
[00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:07.555]  Senator Strom Thurmond dies, and there'll be another big fresh round of debates.
[00:17:09.836 --> 00:17:16.017]  Bush threatens to pacify Liberia, now saying the invasion may begin of another country.
[00:17:16.678 --> 00:17:26.800]  An American military operation to restore order in Liberia looked likely last night as President George W. Bush called for peace in the war-torn West Africa Republic.
[00:17:27.737 --> 00:17:37.483]  He drew cheers and applause from an audience of businessmen, academics, and African leaders when he called on Liberia's President Charles Taylor, an indicted war criminal, to stand down.
[00:17:38.444 --> 00:17:43.927]  President Taylor needs to step down so that his country can be spared further bloodshed, he said.
[00:17:43.987 --> 00:17:57.135]  Earlier, British diplomats raised the possibility of an American military operation with Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's UN ambassador, saying that America would be the natural candidate for any Western-run operation in Liberia.
[00:17:58.129 --> 00:18:11.457]  Mr. Bush called for all sides of Liberia's bloody civil war to return to the negotiating table to end a series of clashes that have cost millions of lives, including 300 in the capital, Morovia, this week.
[00:18:13.658 --> 00:18:18.581]  Okay, so, of course, this country's full of diamonds.
[00:18:18.621 --> 00:18:19.102]  The U.N.
[00:18:19.122 --> 00:18:20.182]  has been wanting to take it over.
[00:18:20.202 --> 00:18:21.523]  De Beers has been kicked out.
[00:18:21.603 --> 00:18:23.324]  It's been breaking their diamond monopoly.
[00:18:24.785 --> 00:18:25.826]  They've admitted this, by the way.
[00:18:25.846 --> 00:18:27.527]  It's about the diamonds, the gold, the oil.
[00:18:28.397 --> 00:18:34.040]  And so there'll be more troops getting shot there, and they'll claim Al-Qaeda runs the government or something.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.923]  You know, every time somebody fights back, they're run by Al-Qaeda, while Al-Qaeda's everywhere.
[00:18:40.023 --> 00:18:41.864]  It's wonderful.
[00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:56.612]  So more war footage for you, your new national pastime, sitting there as our troops huff depleted uranium and nerve gas and aren't given treatment, but you've got a plastic desecrated American flagged away, everything's okay.
[00:18:57.481 --> 00:18:59.483]  You don't care about the troops, but hey, so what?
[00:18:59.623 --> 00:19:02.506]  You're a mindless idiot, so at least you have that.
[00:19:02.946 --> 00:19:03.727]  Turn your guns in.
[00:19:03.747 --> 00:19:04.688]  You're very conservative.
[00:19:05.408 --> 00:19:06.289]  Arrested U.S.
[00:19:06.349 --> 00:19:07.550]  troops abducted.
[00:19:07.931 --> 00:19:09.652]  No, more horrible news.
[00:19:11.594 --> 00:19:13.516]  Six British soldiers were killed on Monday.
[00:19:13.576 --> 00:19:14.377]  There's two U.S.
[00:19:14.417 --> 00:19:18.040]  troops every day this week, so that's up to, I don't know, six or eight.
[00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:20.358]  Arrest as U.S.
[00:19:20.378 --> 00:19:21.459]  troops abducted.
[00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:21.519]  U.S.
[00:19:22.139 --> 00:19:31.922]  forces have arrested three people as they conduct intensive searches for two American soldiers believed to have been abducted north of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
[00:19:33.743 --> 00:19:37.584]  The two servicemen vanished with their vehicle, weapons, and gear on Wednesday night.
[00:19:39.412 --> 00:19:43.394]  Near the town of Balda, there was blood at the scene.
[00:19:43.434 --> 00:19:50.978]  It confirmed the abduction would mark another style of attack on American and British forces occupying the country since BBC's Richard Galpin in Baghdad.
[00:19:51.678 --> 00:19:58.782]  By the way, they say that again, well, we're going to break and we'll be right back and I'll get into more of these tragedies that are unfolding.
[00:19:59.614 --> 00:20:01.278]  And they've got a national draft lined up.
[00:20:01.558 --> 00:20:04.083]  They said we're going to occupy 62 countries.
[00:20:04.765 --> 00:20:05.887]  That's an endless war.
[00:20:06.508 --> 00:20:08.192]  So they've got that lined up for you and your family.
[00:20:08.212 --> 00:20:08.813]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:09.194]  Stay with us.
[00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:16.047]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:16.367 --> 00:20:20.488]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:20.768 --> 00:20:21.308]  We listened.
[00:20:21.628 --> 00:20:26.590]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:27.350]  We listened.
[00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.792]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:31.212 --> 00:20:31.752]  We listened.
[00:20:32.212 --> 00:20:35.213]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[00:20:35.293 --> 00:20:39.896]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium.
[00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.372]  Hello, everybody.
[00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:12.256]  My name is Bob Barefoot.
[00:21:12.376 --> 00:21:16.618]  I'm here today to introduce Bob Barefoot's Best Coral Calcium Supreme Plus.
[00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:23.782]  It has twice as much of the high-grade marine coral calcium from Okinawa, Japan, and almost twice as much of all other nutrients.
[00:21:23.922 --> 00:21:30.486]  Today, it's the best bang for your buck in the health nutrients industry, and coral calcium is the nutrient of the 21st century.
[00:21:31.406 --> 00:21:34.248]  Bob Barefoot's Best Coral Calcium Supreme Plots.
[00:21:34.488 --> 00:21:36.149]  Bob wants to help heal America.
[00:21:36.349 --> 00:21:41.413]  He believes this admirable goal can be achieved in just a few short years, but only with your help.
[00:21:41.793 --> 00:21:49.818]  For a complete listing of all of Bob's products, including the new Barefoot's Best and the original Coral Calcium Supreme, go to robertbarefoot.com or call 1-800-510-4074.

[00:21:50.339 --> 00:21:52.220]  Robert Barefoot wants to help your body heal itself today,
[00:22:01.726 --> 00:22:12.135]  Your beliefs and opinions are attacked constantly.
[00:22:12.315 --> 00:22:16.299]  Media, press, and government support even perpetrate lies to degrade your rights and independence.
[00:22:16.499 --> 00:22:20.222]  The liberally biased populace assaults your mind in order to take advantage of your soul.
[00:22:20.482 --> 00:22:25.346]  Fight back every day with the 2003 Freedom Calendar, available by calling Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:27.868 --> 00:22:28.389]  We're good to go.
[00:22:46.288 --> 00:22:46.348]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:46.368 --> 00:22:47.429]  Get it now and start spreading the truth.
[00:23:09.707 --> 00:23:10.227]  That's right.
[00:23:10.247 --> 00:23:13.388]  LifeWise will send a jar of JointWise cream to you absolutely free of charge with no obligation of any kind.
[00:23:33.852 --> 00:23:38.136]  Joint Wise Cream customers report quick penetrating relief, and Joint Wise Cream is unique.
[00:23:38.296 --> 00:23:46.583]  It's the only formulation that contains this exclusive combination of powerful ingredients, including glucosamine, MSM, chondroitin, boswellin, capsaicin, and more.
[00:23:46.763 --> 00:23:50.346]  Why not let Joint Wise Cream speed pain relief to your aching muscles and joints?
[00:24:22.193 --> 00:24:35.928]  I've been studying the Iraq situation, and there really wasn't much resistance in the first few weeks after the takeover by the globalists using our troops that they see as disposable.
[00:24:36.989 --> 00:24:41.654]  Disposable heroes is really what the government sees them as.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:57.650]  And after gun confiscation and door-to-door arrests and little kids being put in re-education camps, I mean, there's video and photos of this, the news admits it, people being tortured after some rapes by our glorious forces.
[00:24:58.702 --> 00:25:00.703]  And yes, they do that everywhere.
[00:25:00.783 --> 00:25:03.964]  Japan, Korea, Latin America, right here in the U.S.
[00:25:04.184 --> 00:25:05.385]  This is what armies do.
[00:25:05.445 --> 00:25:08.085]  There are some bad people in the military.
[00:25:08.125 --> 00:25:08.826]  That does happen.
[00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:10.546]  They occasionally do something wrong.
[00:25:11.147 --> 00:25:14.928]  The Iraqis are sick of it, and even people in the South have been on their side.
[00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:26.676]  Are now getting quite angry, but they claim the boogeyman of Goldstein, I mean Saddam, you know, this boogeyman character of 1984, you know, it's all his fault.
[00:25:26.776 --> 00:25:28.657]  He's the one organizing it and running it.
[00:25:28.677 --> 00:25:30.878]  It's been quite a liberation, hasn't it?
[00:25:30.978 --> 00:25:33.399]  Cholera spread all over the country.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:44.365]  The Associated Press reports that when little kids come up with body parts half blown off or fingers missing and beg for medical attention, they're just denied it.
[00:25:45.612 --> 00:25:48.434]  And our troops are getting very angry and upset about it.
[00:25:48.494 --> 00:25:49.514]  They want to give treatment.
[00:25:50.114 --> 00:25:51.015]  But they've got orders.
[00:25:51.295 --> 00:25:52.456]  And the Iraqis are paid.
[00:25:52.476 --> 00:25:54.537]  They're not allowed to have jobs unless it's through the U.S.
[00:25:54.557 --> 00:25:54.937]  government.
[00:25:55.597 --> 00:26:00.620]  And they're given $20 a month by Halliburton, who's got a $7-plus million contract.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.641]  But they get $20 a month.
[00:26:03.181 --> 00:26:04.582]  It's under slave wages.
[00:26:05.703 --> 00:26:08.704]  It's a nation of 20-plus million slaves.
[00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:10.846]  And they're quite angry.
[00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:13.167]  And our troops are angry about it, too.
[00:26:14.153 --> 00:26:20.856]  Because they don't want to be part of an oppressive force, and now the morale that was quite high is plummeting.
[00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:35.824]  But hey, armchair quarterbacks here at home can affix plastic flags, festoon their cars with plastic desecrated American flags, and who cares if the troops are dying and getting sick now from DU?
[00:26:36.244 --> 00:26:37.385]  By the way, that's now admitted.
[00:26:38.405 --> 00:26:39.866]  But, yeah, so what?
[00:26:39.926 --> 00:26:42.807]  You know, supporting the troops means letting them huff D.U.
[00:26:43.047 --> 00:26:46.149]  Okay, well, then if that means supporting them, I don't support them.
[00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:47.609]  I don't support killing our troops.
[00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:48.610]  I'm sorry.
[00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.172]  I know being mindless idiot means you support the troops.
[00:26:52.232 --> 00:26:52.672]  I'm sorry.
[00:26:52.712 --> 00:26:53.592]  I just can't do it then.
[00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:59.155]  And so now troops are being killed and abducted and blown up, and it's terrible.
[00:27:00.777 --> 00:27:03.998]  But here on the home front, they're setting up a police state.
[00:27:05.018 --> 00:27:16.261]  But Congressman Tom Tancredo of Colorado, who we've had on the show many times, says, 9-1-1 repeat would be fault of Bush, Congress, GOP, lawmaker charges.
[00:27:17.201 --> 00:27:19.282]  If another terrorist attack is conducted on U.S.
[00:27:19.382 --> 00:27:25.343]  soil by illegal aliens, the fault will lie with Congress and the President, one lawmaker asserted Thursday.
[00:27:26.324 --> 00:27:27.544]  Well, they continue to say this.
[00:27:28.761 --> 00:27:29.241]  We're good to go.
[00:27:55.965 --> 00:27:56.945]  They went ballistic.
[00:27:57.005 --> 00:28:05.307]  Well, they announced in Roll Call Magazine that he is being targeted by President Bush, just like Senator Bob Smith was targeted.
[00:28:06.088 --> 00:28:08.248]  Ron Paul has been targeted by the Republicans.
[00:28:08.748 --> 00:28:14.510]  If you're actually pro-gun, pro-border, pro-America, anti-abortion, you are targeted.
[00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.751]  Tancredo said he has made the same statement to the White House officials.
[00:28:18.791 --> 00:28:21.692]  Their response, they told me never to darken the door except for the White House again.
[00:28:21.732 --> 00:28:23.452]  Tancredo revealed they went ballistic.
[00:28:24.341 --> 00:28:26.182]  They asked, how dare you say a thing like that?
[00:28:26.263 --> 00:28:33.828]  I said, you tell me who people should blame, the Elks Club, who's responsible, Tancredo recalled, asking White House officials.
[00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:45.577]  And we'll talk more about this with the head of the Colorado Senate, who is joining us coming up in the next segment.
[00:28:46.994 --> 00:28:50.117]  So that's your new America, by the way.
[00:28:50.838 --> 00:28:54.601]  And they're not just having secret arrest and secret execution in this country.
[00:28:54.762 --> 00:28:57.684]  England, Australia are passing similar laws.
[00:28:58.625 --> 00:29:01.608]  Unlimited power of arrest, ASIO says.
[00:29:02.249 --> 00:29:09.075]  They can now secretly arrest members of the press and make them answer questions, or any of the citizenry in these new laws.
[00:29:09.116 --> 00:29:11.478]  The press is complaining that they're not being excluded.
[00:29:12.253 --> 00:29:13.853]  And the family need not be told.
[00:29:14.073 --> 00:29:20.315]  If the judge feels you're not answering questions truthfully, you can be secretly given five years in prison.
[00:29:21.715 --> 00:29:26.416]  Now that's tame compared to Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[00:29:26.536 --> 00:29:29.416]  Here it's secret arrest, secret execution.
[00:29:29.896 --> 00:29:32.657]  They cremate your body and they've admitted they have crematoriums.
[00:29:33.637 --> 00:29:35.057]  Oh yeah, that's Rocky Mountain News.
[00:29:36.818 --> 00:29:37.778]  And you're never seen again.
[00:29:38.821 --> 00:29:41.002]  So, Australia's tame.
[00:29:41.462 --> 00:29:52.324]  Says a retired judge is secretly in panel, you're arrested secretly, brought before them, and you don't answer all their questions, and they feel you're not being honest, five years in prison and your family's not told.
[00:29:53.305 --> 00:29:55.485]  Says that right here, Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:29:56.125 --> 00:29:57.646]  Hey, that sounds like freedom, doesn't it?
[00:29:57.666 --> 00:29:58.346]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.686 --> 00:30:01.607]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:03.687]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.607 --> 00:30:07.288]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.436 --> 00:30:16.619]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:30:17.319 --> 00:30:22.402]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... 7091.
[00:30:22.602 --> 00:30:26.163]  That web address again is calbinpuresoap.com.
[00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:29.265]  Try Pure Soap once, and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:30:54.298 --> 00:30:55.719]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:55.839 --> 00:30:57.621]  Alex Jones here, live.
[00:30:57.641 --> 00:31:08.190]  And in the next hour, we have Glenn Spencer coming on from American Patrol tracking how the Mexican government has said the last three presidents in a row, many times on...
[00:31:08.991 --> 00:31:09.632]  We're good to go.
[00:31:37.626 --> 00:31:45.474]  And earlier I was reading a report here, 911 repeat would be fault of Bush Congress GOP lawmaker charges.
[00:31:46.274 --> 00:31:55.183]  It's a GOP lawmaker, Congressman Tom Tancredo, who we've interviewed many times, who has been targeted by the White House for being...
[00:31:55.934 --> 00:31:56.355]  We're good to go.
[00:32:11.657 --> 00:32:13.637]  Now we have these matricula cards.
[00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:16.078]  Mexico started issuing them a few years ago.
[00:32:16.458 --> 00:32:17.998]  Now 800 plus U.S.
[00:32:18.078 --> 00:32:20.139]  cities are accepting them.
[00:32:20.239 --> 00:32:22.339]  You can go buy one for $24.
[00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:25.980]  Now Poland, Guatemala is issuing their own cards.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:31.241]  Up in Minnesota, they're announcing that they're not going to comply with the feds.
[00:32:31.641 --> 00:32:33.162]  I'm going after illegal aliens.
[00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:35.002]  This is insane.
[00:32:36.047 --> 00:32:36.827]  Totally insane.
[00:32:36.847 --> 00:32:45.310]  We're honored to have joining us Colorado Senate President John Andrews, and he's in a big story in the Denver Post and the Associated Press.
[00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.290]  There's a bunch of articles.
[00:32:46.791 --> 00:32:57.754]  He's proposed a state law, and it is the state's job to tell the cities to knock it off and to stop their racketeering, basically, and that's my word, empowering felons.
[00:32:58.635 --> 00:33:01.316]  And, Senator, it's good to have you on the show.
[00:33:01.336 --> 00:33:02.596]  I appreciate you taking the time out.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.040]  Hi, Alex.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.201]  Glad to be with you today.
[00:33:05.221 --> 00:33:07.262]  It's not just a proposed law.
[00:33:07.442 --> 00:33:08.882]  It is law in Colorado.
[00:33:08.902 --> 00:33:20.907]  We are the first of the 50 states to say no to these bogus ID cards that attempt to erase the distinction between a legal immigrant, and we welcome those folks, but the illegals.
[00:33:21.542 --> 00:33:24.863]  Are hiding behind these matricula cards, and Colorado said no more.
[00:33:25.323 --> 00:33:26.583]  I can see how that sounded.
[00:33:26.643 --> 00:33:30.384]  I mean, but you're the guy that brought this law forward, correct?
[00:33:30.944 --> 00:33:31.244]  I am.
[00:33:31.404 --> 00:33:36.386]  I'm working with a state representative who's also a constituent of Congressman Tancredo.
[00:33:36.426 --> 00:33:51.029]  It was actually Representative Don Lee that started it in the statehouse, and I saw it through the state senate, and I had the honor to testify about it before a congressional subcommittee last week, and I urged Congress to legislate as Colorado has done.
[00:33:51.664 --> 00:34:06.913]  Now, this is wildly popular with people across the spectrum, unless they're just totally American-hating people that don't want to have any jobs or want the health care systems blown out, which has happened in California.
[00:34:07.553 --> 00:34:09.835]  Governor Davis is being recalled right now.
[00:34:10.355 --> 00:34:11.976]  That process is going nicely.
[00:34:12.997 --> 00:34:18.640]  Why is this bill that you've now gotten passed so important for the rest of the country?
[00:34:19.881 --> 00:34:28.785]  We see three reasons why the matricula card erasing the distinction of legal and illegal immigrants is bad, Alex.
[00:34:28.985 --> 00:34:31.846]  First of all, it's a matter of homeland security.
[00:34:32.506 --> 00:34:43.731]  Not to say that very many folks from Mexico who are coming here looking for a better life economically and politically, as you just said, would represent a threat, but
[00:34:44.369 --> 00:34:57.513]  The bigger the pool of illegals into which the bad guys can blend themselves, these Islamic terrorists can blend themselves, the tougher it is for our Homeland Security agencies to track them down.
[00:34:58.094 --> 00:35:10.878]  And the matricula card gives a false sense of security when it's accepted by law enforcement or other public agencies that somebody claiming to be Jose Lopez really is Jose Lopez.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:20.184]  When, in fact, there's no verification that is made when the embassy or the consulate issues that card to some guy that says, hey, I'm Jose.
[00:35:20.464 --> 00:35:32.430]  And we've got instances here in Colorado of the same individual with his picture on three different matricula cards, very official looking from the Mexican consulate in Denver, and three different alias for the guy.
[00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.851]  So, first of all, there's a Homeland Security concern.
[00:35:35.391 --> 00:35:36.712]  Second, as you just said,
[00:35:37.284 --> 00:35:44.885]  There is a fiscal integrity concern because there's a lot of public services that are meant for legal residents of the United States only.
[00:35:44.905 --> 00:35:51.827]  Colorado has struggled with this, as many states have, as we have been having to cut our budget in tough economic times.
[00:35:52.307 --> 00:35:59.628]  We're having to say, if you're not in this country legally, you can't have health and welfare and education and other taxpayer services.
[00:36:00.028 --> 00:36:04.709]  And yet the matriculate card also would provide access, and we've had Denver
[00:36:05.188 --> 00:36:09.749]  And other Colorado municipalities saying, yeah, sure, give us a matricula card.
[00:36:10.229 --> 00:36:11.710]  We'll let you bleed the taxpayer.
[00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:20.172]  Is Denver, and again, we're talking to Colorado Senate President John Andrews, who got this bill passed in his state, and here's the headline, Denver Post, U.S.
[00:36:20.212 --> 00:36:25.353]  ban on matriculas urged by Colorado's Andrews, IDs not verifiable.
[00:36:26.313 --> 00:36:27.434]  Now it's not just Mexico.
[00:36:27.454 --> 00:36:31.276]  It's Guatemala, Chile, El Salvador, Poland, China.
[00:36:31.636 --> 00:36:35.158]  They're all saying, oh, we'll have our embassies issue these.
[00:36:35.218 --> 00:36:40.760]  The police don't know if they're real or they're fake, even if the countries did due diligence.
[00:36:42.501 --> 00:36:48.806]  We have the Communist Chinese, Senate reports, federal reports, say that control over 3,000 front companies.
[00:36:49.086 --> 00:36:52.088]  Now they can bring in their agents, their drug dealers, their triads.
[00:36:52.448 --> 00:36:57.872]  I mean, this is a wonderland for terrorists, organized criminals, welfare cheats.
[00:36:58.772 --> 00:36:59.773]  It's a nightmare.
[00:36:59.793 --> 00:37:08.279]  And what a joke to say that, oh, we're worried about terrorists, give up your liberty, citizens, and then to have the illegals here with all these fake cards.
[00:37:08.379 --> 00:37:13.582]  There's about 20 countries that are doing it or proposing to do it, and Mexico is leading the way.
[00:37:13.622 --> 00:37:22.526]  And the congressional testimony a week ago emphasized there was a Latino congressman, a Democrat from Chicago, who heads the Hispanic caucus at the U.S.
[00:37:22.546 --> 00:37:26.688]  House, and he said the matricula is no problem and nothing new about it.
[00:37:26.768 --> 00:37:29.390]  It's been issued since 1871.
[00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:37.454]  True enough, but only in the last year or two has the Fox government in Mexico City gone on a concerted campaign against
[00:37:37.799 --> 00:37:38.139]  Thank you.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:05.724]  Well, the last president of Mexico said, I got him on video on C-SPAN, said that the territorial borders of Mexico extend through their population, and they're giving dual citizenship now.
[00:38:23.594 --> 00:38:29.699]  Well, it's just a matter of time until these people demand that they will vote, even if they're not American citizens.
[00:38:29.719 --> 00:38:31.560]  They want to vote on both sides of the border.
[00:38:33.241 --> 00:38:35.183]  Well, it's incredible, Senator.
[00:38:37.164 --> 00:38:43.669]  And, you know, to me, Alex, it's not about any one country or any one people or ethnic group.
[00:38:43.689 --> 00:38:45.691]  It's not about bashing Mexicans.
[00:38:45.771 --> 00:38:48.733]  It's about the rule of law and whether we take U.S.
[00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:49.914]  national sovereignty seriously.
[00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:51.035]  Seriously.
[00:38:51.335 --> 00:39:12.500]  At the congressional hearing last week from Iowa, of all places, Iowa, a long, long way from the Mexican border, Congressman Steve King of Iowa told of going to see a school principal in suburban Des Moines, a Hispanic guy, an educator, who had signed an ad protesting King's immigration concerns.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.281]  And King says to the gentleman, what's your problem?
[00:39:15.839 --> 00:39:18.660]  And this Hispanic American, presumably a U.S.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:25.322]  citizen, an educator, someone in charge of molding the minds of kids, says, look, brother, we didn't cross the border.
[00:39:25.342 --> 00:39:26.482]  The border crossed us.
[00:39:26.882 --> 00:39:35.504]  We're in the process of getting this corner of the country back, and we want to thank you because we're getting it back, financially improved from the condition in which we lost it in the 1840s.
[00:39:35.564 --> 00:39:37.605]  It's just that blatant.
[00:39:38.829 --> 00:39:45.716]  Well, I mean, let's talk about Mecha, La Raza, and others, which La Raza means the race, and Mecha, their websites.
[00:39:45.956 --> 00:39:52.143]  I mean, literally, it's way past the Klan, who I also find to be unsavory.
[00:39:52.943 --> 00:39:54.345]  And it is a racial movement.
[00:39:54.685 --> 00:39:55.926]  On that end of it, it is.
[00:39:57.148 --> 00:39:58.109]  We're good to go.
[00:40:24.668 --> 00:40:26.128]  I mean, we've got to talk about this.
[00:40:26.529 --> 00:40:27.329]  I live in Texas.
[00:40:27.389 --> 00:40:31.990]  If you go over the border and you break their rules, they'll beat you up and put you in jail forever.
[00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.391]  Even if you don't break the rules, they will.
[00:40:34.411 --> 00:40:38.392]  They'll shoot you if you come across their border illegally, but that's okay.
[00:40:39.032 --> 00:40:43.994]  It's this whole breakdown of society now.
[00:40:44.554 --> 00:40:51.876]  And how can the federal government say, give your liberty up for security while they are trying to then accept all of these fake IDs?
[00:40:53.849 --> 00:40:55.310]  It's absolutely inconsistent.
[00:40:56.470 --> 00:41:08.235]  The chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that testified in favor of the matricula in the hearing in House Judiciary a week ago doesn't make policy arguments.
[00:41:08.275 --> 00:41:10.656]  He essentially puts up a bunch of emotional rhetoric.
[00:41:10.696 --> 00:41:13.977]  He says, who do you think made up your hotel room today?
[00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:17.539]  Who do you think picked the fruit that you ate on your menu today?
[00:41:18.172 --> 00:41:27.199]  These are part of the 10 million illegals in this country, and what we ought to do is just essentially surrender, give an amnesty to all of them, and move on.
[00:41:27.479 --> 00:41:30.421]  But it's a lot more than 10 million, Senator, and we know this.
[00:41:30.441 --> 00:41:35.825]  400 million people in Latin America, 20 million new births a year.
[00:41:36.145 --> 00:41:38.427]  They're building these big highways down into there.
[00:41:38.447 --> 00:41:41.970]  I mean, folks, do you want hundreds of millions...
[00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:43.251]  We're good to go.
[00:41:43.591 --> 00:41:44.712]  We're good to go.
[00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:23.826]  There's just all those reasons, and the denial that I saw when I testified before Congress, and I saw it from Republicans, unfortunately, as well as Democrats.
[00:42:24.266 --> 00:42:36.792]  A Republican congressman from Arizona and one from Utah sat on this judiciary subcommittee that's supposed to be helping control our borders and made the argument for the matricula card and the argument for a massive amnesty.
[00:42:37.352 --> 00:42:38.613]  Frankly, I was shocked that...
[00:42:41.873 --> 00:42:46.836]  Well, I had the new congressman on from Arizona.
[00:42:47.537 --> 00:42:47.917]  Which one?
[00:42:48.498 --> 00:42:50.499]  Oh, man, see, that's why I said the new congressman.
[00:42:50.519 --> 00:42:52.060]  I had him on, like, in January.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.482]  Is it Congressman Blake, by chance?
[00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:57.164]  No, it's a Hispanic name.
[00:42:57.264 --> 00:42:57.544]  Okay.
[00:42:58.525 --> 00:42:59.185]  I had him on.
[00:42:59.226 --> 00:43:00.647]  It made big news when he said it.
[00:43:01.287 --> 00:43:02.548]  It'll pop in my head in a second.
[00:43:02.868 --> 00:43:04.309]  It was back in January.
[00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:05.110]  But he said...
[00:43:06.065 --> 00:43:08.366]  That this belongs to Mexico.
[00:43:08.386 --> 00:43:16.689]  I mean, I had a congressman on the air that audio files on prisonplanet.com, and they link to it at American Patrol and a bunch of other websites.
[00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:23.651]  But I had him on here, and when Glenn Spencer's on in the next hour, I know you would have left us, but I can ask Glenn his name because he remembers the incident.
[00:43:24.281 --> 00:43:26.002]  And he knows all these characters.
[00:43:26.022 --> 00:43:37.187]  I mean, imagine if I went down to Mexico, got elected, of course he wouldn't let me, but I got elected to a seat in their government, and then I said, this belongs to the U.S.
[00:43:37.507 --> 00:43:38.288]  It's just amazing.
[00:43:38.628 --> 00:43:42.770]  Now, you talked about this congressman in Iowa or Ohio?
[00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:43.630]  No, Iowa.
[00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.691]  Iowa.
[00:43:44.731 --> 00:43:45.791]  Congressman Steve King.
[00:43:45.831 --> 00:43:49.633]  He is a real hero of the wake-up call on illegal immigration.
[00:43:50.126 --> 00:43:54.728]  And you said that he went to this school teacher, and this teacher said, the border crossed us.
[00:43:54.968 --> 00:43:55.468]  Yeah, right.
[00:43:55.548 --> 00:44:03.032]  And this teacher said, we're getting the country back, and thank you for substantially improving it while you occupied it.
[00:44:03.212 --> 00:44:11.415]  It's just the blatant revolutionary attitude ought to wake all of us up.
[00:44:12.095 --> 00:44:12.716]  But, I mean...
[00:44:14.717 --> 00:44:19.661]  Southern North America was run by the Mayans and the Aztecs, who enslaved all the tribes.
[00:44:20.022 --> 00:44:21.083]  The Spanish did it.
[00:44:21.343 --> 00:44:22.224]  Santa Ana did it.
[00:44:22.264 --> 00:44:24.786]  I mean, who's taking it back?
[00:44:24.846 --> 00:44:25.787]  I don't understand this.
[00:44:27.548 --> 00:44:30.611]  There's no historical validity to it, Alex, at all.
[00:44:30.991 --> 00:44:37.957]  But it is inflammatory rhetoric that is very attractive to some people that are looking for a shortcut
[00:44:40.278 --> 00:44:51.069]  But isn't this sedition, isn't it treason to have members of Congress and to have people in the country openly announcing we want to bring down America?
[00:44:51.329 --> 00:44:54.372]  I mean, that sounds like the enemy combatant designation to me.
[00:44:54.612 --> 00:44:56.174]  Well, I don't know of any member of Congress...
[00:44:57.694 --> 00:45:00.815]  Well, when I get special on, he heard the interview with this guy.
[00:45:01.255 --> 00:45:06.456]  No, he said that this is... He brought up the Guadalupe Hidalgo, the treaty.
[00:45:06.856 --> 00:45:10.437]  He said, hey, this is really Mexico.
[00:45:10.457 --> 00:45:11.697]  These people have a right to be here.
[00:45:11.717 --> 00:45:13.218]  It was the same statement you just said.
[00:45:14.778 --> 00:45:16.058]  And I'm sorry I don't have his name.
[00:45:16.238 --> 00:45:17.499]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[00:45:17.839 --> 00:45:23.180]  And while we're talking about members of Congress that are AWOL on the issue...
[00:45:24.969 --> 00:45:26.911]  Lamar Smith, you're in Austin, right?
[00:45:26.931 --> 00:45:27.751]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:27.771 --> 00:45:29.633]  And is Lamar Smith your congressman there?
[00:45:30.854 --> 00:45:33.436]  No, we're unlucky enough to have Lloyd Doggett.
[00:45:33.456 --> 00:45:34.878]  He's just south of me.
[00:45:35.478 --> 00:45:37.240]  Lamar Smith for San Antonio.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:43.305]  Okay, Smith sits on the House Immigration Subcommittee where I testified last week.
[00:45:43.705 --> 00:45:45.687]  His eyes are wide open on this issue.
[00:45:46.107 --> 00:45:47.208]  He asked very, very...
[00:45:49.295 --> 00:46:07.346]  A tough and perceptive question about the danger posed by the matricula and he really was very blunt about the conscious strategy of the Vox government to try to create a dual citizenship and erase the border.
[00:46:08.789 --> 00:46:16.298]  But corporate America's behind that, and Bush is in a love fest with Fox and would have passed that if 9-1-1 wouldn't have taken place.
[00:46:16.338 --> 00:46:22.685]  When 9-1-1 happened, that kind of... Remember the week before 9-1-1, he had Fox at the White House and they were announcing all this?
[00:46:22.885 --> 00:46:27.150]  Yeah, and the whole thing is coming back onto the front burner now.
[00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:29.232]  There is at least one bill...
[00:46:30.785 --> 00:46:45.777]  From two Arizona congressmen that creates a massive amnesty disguised as a guest worker program, but it isn't a guest worker program because these folks get a temporary green card, and then it becomes permanent after three years, and nobody ever has to go home.
[00:46:46.257 --> 00:46:47.678]  That's not a guest worker program.
[00:46:47.799 --> 00:46:48.599]  That's an amnesty.
[00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:53.123]  We're talking to Colorado Senate President John Andrews, and I really appreciate him being on.
[00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:54.924]  I have a few other questions for him.
[00:46:54.944 --> 00:46:56.425]  He can stay with us another five, ten minutes.
[00:46:56.485 --> 00:46:57.787]  But, Senator...
[00:47:00.277 --> 00:47:02.238]  Look, I mean, this is such a massive problem.
[00:47:03.098 --> 00:47:05.540]  There's 6.5 billion people on the globe.
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.800]  They all want to come here.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.661]  Is 500 million enough?
[00:47:08.741 --> 00:47:09.601]  Is 2 million enough?
[00:47:09.942 --> 00:47:12.183]  I mean, how many people are we going to accept here?
[00:47:12.223 --> 00:47:13.943]  This is getting insane.
[00:47:13.963 --> 00:47:15.704]  20 million new births a year.
[00:47:16.164 --> 00:47:17.485]  We've got to get a hold of this.
[00:47:17.525 --> 00:47:18.265]  This is crazy.
[00:47:18.305 --> 00:47:21.467]  I mean, the Mexicans don't let the Guatemalans take over.
[00:47:21.507 --> 00:47:23.668]  They've got a big fence down there with Guatemala.
[00:47:24.505 --> 00:47:26.245]  Yeah, the hypocrisy is awful.
[00:47:26.766 --> 00:47:30.747]  Their southern border means something, but our southern border isn't supposed to mean something.
[00:47:30.967 --> 00:47:33.587]  But if we don't have a border, we don't have a sovereign country.
[00:47:34.407 --> 00:47:34.747]  Amen.
[00:47:35.348 --> 00:47:48.891]  And, you know, I've got a strong libertarian streak in my conservative Republican outlook, and I'm a free market guy, and that used to make me more or less of an open borders guy.
[00:47:50.604 --> 00:47:54.627]  And not to say no immigration controls, but to be sort of relaxed about the whole thing.
[00:47:54.667 --> 00:47:59.231]  Sort of the optimistic perspective of the Wall Street Journal editorial page.
[00:47:59.291 --> 00:48:02.373]  But now they're saying this is Africa.
[00:48:02.513 --> 00:48:10.700]  I've had to take another look at all of the aspects of this, the security aspects, the budget aspects of it.
[00:48:12.171 --> 00:48:19.458]  And we've got a tenured professor right here at one of our state colleges in Denver who spends a lot of his time propagandizing.
[00:48:19.518 --> 00:48:23.782]  Tell you what, Senator, we've got a quick three-minute break, and then just do five minutes on the other side with us if you can.
[00:48:23.802 --> 00:48:27.205]  We'll be right back with the Colorado Senate President, John Andrews.
[00:48:27.225 --> 00:48:29.987]  We really appreciate him standing firm for America.
[00:48:31.394 --> 00:48:35.741]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:48:35.941 --> 00:48:40.368]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:48:40.508 --> 00:48:44.895]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:48:44.935 --> 00:48:46.277]  The New World Order.
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:52.264]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:48:52.344 --> 00:48:59.272]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:48:59.412 --> 00:49:01.415]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:49:01.715 --> 00:49:07.059]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:49:30.835 --> 00:49:34.318]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:49:34.578 --> 00:49:38.101]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:49:38.181 --> 00:49:42.125]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:49:42.345 --> 00:49:48.510]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:56.837]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:49:57.537 --> 00:49:58.177]  We're good to go.
[00:50:12.602 --> 00:50:15.803]  You get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:12.920]  All right, folks.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.141]  You cannot talk about a more serious issue.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:46.544]  I mean, of the top issues, frankly, the border and sovereignty may even outstrip the Second Amendment.
[00:51:47.284 --> 00:51:52.467]  I mean, they're right up there as kind of a dual binary system.
[00:51:52.507 --> 00:51:55.049]  I mean, it's very, very important.
[00:51:56.049 --> 00:51:58.731]  And the congressman is Grijalva.
[00:51:58.911 --> 00:52:01.713]  In fact, I knew that was the name, but I wasn't sure.
[00:52:01.773 --> 00:52:07.576]  I wanted to go to the congressional website and look at the representative from Cochise County area.
[00:52:07.616 --> 00:52:08.457]  It's Grijalva.
[00:52:09.193 --> 00:52:10.735]  I mean, this guy is a piece of work.
[00:52:11.395 --> 00:52:16.341]  We have him on tape saying basically this is Mexico and I don't have any right to call for sovereignty.
[00:52:17.512 --> 00:52:30.635]  We're talking to Colorado Senate President John Andrews who got a bill passed in his state, and it's, again, wildly popular to not accept basically fake ID cards issued by Communist China and Mexico and Guatemala and Poland.
[00:52:30.655 --> 00:52:33.816]  Of course, we always talk about Mexico because it's the majority.
[00:52:34.136 --> 00:52:37.017]  That's why we focus on the Hispanic group coming across.
[00:52:37.077 --> 00:52:37.917]  It's not racial.
[00:52:37.937 --> 00:52:46.939]  It's the fact that that's the majority, and most Hispanics I've talked to are very upset and know this is destroying our sovereignty and our economy.
[00:52:47.339 --> 00:52:48.919]  So the media tries to make it racial.
[00:52:48.979 --> 00:52:52.700]  It's not, as the state senator president was saying.
[00:52:54.121 --> 00:52:59.902]  Continuing, sir, with the problems we face, any other key points you'd like to make, Senator?
[00:53:00.582 --> 00:53:13.445]  Well, let me just encourage listeners to go to coloradosenate.com, our website where one of our lead stories right now is my congressional testimony that I gave on June 19th to a U.S.
[00:53:13.485 --> 00:53:15.506]  House Immigration Subcommittee.
[00:53:16.167 --> 00:53:29.718]  And that has a rundown on Colorado's new bill that says state and local officials will not accept the phony consular ID card, whether it's from Mexico, Poland, Peru, or any other country.
[00:53:30.438 --> 00:53:40.506]  And there is an exception where a police officer can take this card as a starting point to figure out who somebody is on a law enforcement stop.
[00:53:40.902 --> 00:53:41.602]  We're good to go.
[00:54:05.768 --> 00:54:06.368]  We're good to go.
[00:54:06.388 --> 00:54:06.689]  I think?
[00:54:34.642 --> 00:54:38.609]  And the people supposedly in control of our borders are saying forget it.
[00:54:38.649 --> 00:54:40.532]  We don't want to cooperate with state government.
[00:54:40.713 --> 00:54:47.064]  Senator, I read an AP article out of Ohio where they were running a checkpoint during the federally funded checkpoints.
[00:54:47.702 --> 00:54:47.882]  I think?
[00:55:10.023 --> 00:55:12.064]  So they even have more rights than citizens.
[00:55:12.125 --> 00:55:20.450]  I mean, I can't go out and get five or six fake ID cards and have police accept them, but some illegal from Poland or Mexico can.
[00:55:21.611 --> 00:55:22.872]  It's absolutely backwards.
[00:55:23.232 --> 00:55:30.397]  That's what Colorado House Bill 1224, now law in Colorado, first state in the country, that's what we're trying to stop.
[00:55:30.617 --> 00:55:37.442]  And I do hope people will visit ColoradoSenate.com and learn more about the bill and encourage legislators in their states
[00:55:38.143 --> 00:55:40.624]  To follow suit, just like we're encouraging the U.S.
[00:55:40.684 --> 00:55:41.645]  Congress to follow suit.
[00:55:41.665 --> 00:55:48.008]  And if there's more terror, and it's an illegal, and you know it's going to be an illegal, it's going to be their fault.
[00:55:48.208 --> 00:55:51.090]  You tell them what Congressman Tancredo said.
[00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:58.654]  Do you agree with his statement that those that don't pass these laws are going to be held responsible by the people for helping the terrorists?
[00:55:59.715 --> 00:56:05.118]  All of us that are lawmakers in state or federal legislative responsibility...
[00:56:06.517 --> 00:56:10.680]  There is an unforgivable omission if we don't wake up to this problem.
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:11.380]  All right.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.742]  To Colorado Senate President John Andrews, hope to have you back up in the future.
[00:56:15.343 --> 00:56:16.363]  And thanks for coming on.
[00:56:16.403 --> 00:56:17.204]  Have a great weekend.
[00:56:17.244 --> 00:56:17.784]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:56:18.305 --> 00:56:19.946]  I'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:56:22.007 --> 00:56:25.910]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:31.573]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:56:31.833 --> 00:56:32.314]  Ideal for...
[00:56:35.624 --> 00:56:38.824]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.262 --> 00:56:47.902]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.562 --> 00:56:49.622]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.323 --> 00:56:51.463]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.103 --> 00:56:52.903]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.664 --> 00:56:54.524]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:58.885]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.406 --> 00:57:03.487]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:08.049 --> 00:57:09.810]  All right, folks, it's Friday.
[00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:11.711]  We've got two hours left.
[00:57:11.791 --> 00:57:28.984]  We've got Glenn Spencer, one of my favorite guests, to come on to talk about the destruction of America and our sovereignty, how illegal aliens get more welfare, more tuition, more rights, are allowed to have fake ID cards that anyone can get basically dozens of.
[00:57:30.848 --> 00:57:32.709]  And how citizens are losing their liberties.
[00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:34.250]  That's coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:38.813]  When we get back in the next segment, I'll go to Brenton, Connecticut, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:57:39.274 --> 00:57:50.861]  Have you liked to join me on air to talk about the issue that the State Senate President of Colorado was talking about, the national sovereignty issue, as Mexico announces that the United States belongs to Mexico.
[00:57:51.022 --> 00:57:54.784]  It is official, and the White House is behind it, involved in it.
[00:57:55.164 --> 00:58:00.468]  The white men, the old bankers are part of it, wanting to break down our sovereignty and destroy our liberties.
[00:58:01.048 --> 00:58:10.312]  And if they can bring another 20 million illegals in who have no history of freedom, that'll make a nice mass for them to push around an order who don't have any understanding of freedom.
[00:58:10.592 --> 00:58:12.513]  And it'll drive down the wages even further.
[00:58:13.633 --> 00:58:14.514]  So that's coming up.
[00:58:14.554 --> 00:58:16.775]  More on that, of course, your calls in the next segment.
[00:58:16.795 --> 00:58:16.835]  800-259-9231.
[00:58:21.304 --> 00:58:25.065]  The feds are announcing they want to track all cattle and have Homeland Security involved in it.
[00:58:25.085 --> 00:58:32.588]  You'll have to track and trace your cattle, your sheep, your goats, and there'll be a new tax for you, federal inspections of your farms and ranches.
[00:58:33.208 --> 00:58:34.108]  Hope you enjoy it.
[00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:41.571]  Ridge announced last year, I have him on tape on C-SPAN, saying this is for tracking and tracing part of Homeland Security.
[00:58:41.611 --> 00:58:45.952]  Now they claim it's to stop mad cow, which is totally ridiculous.
[00:58:46.212 --> 00:58:47.433]  So we'll look out for that.
[00:58:47.473 --> 00:58:48.193]  That's coming up.
[00:58:49.308 --> 00:58:51.549]  Big story, unlimited power of arrest.
[00:58:52.129 --> 00:58:56.510]  Australia's domestic intelligence agency, ASIO, will have aggressive new powers.
[00:58:57.250 --> 00:59:03.331]  From today to detain for an unlimited period, citizens suspected of having information about terrorist offenses.
[00:59:03.931 --> 00:59:15.534]  It says they can secretly arrest you, bring you before a secret judge, a non-sitting judge, and if they feel you haven't told the truth, on the spot, put you secretly in prison for five years.
[00:59:16.301 --> 00:59:17.322]  You think that's bad?
[00:59:17.702 --> 00:59:19.424]  That's much better than here in the U.S.
[00:59:20.264 --> 00:59:22.306]  They just won't admit what they're doing, even though it's in the bill.
[00:59:23.547 --> 00:59:24.207]  But don't worry.
[00:59:24.328 --> 00:59:27.030]  Paul Wolfel wants to oversee military tribunals.
[00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:29.312]  He will select the secret judges.
[00:59:29.372 --> 00:59:32.894]  He will select who is secretly arrested and who is secretly executed.
[00:59:33.375 --> 00:59:38.459]  Source on this, Associated Press, Robert Burns.
[00:59:39.099 --> 00:59:39.780]  That's coming up.
[00:59:41.182 --> 00:59:41.302]  U.S.
[00:59:41.362 --> 00:59:42.722]  pledges to avoid torture.
[00:59:43.143 --> 00:59:46.543]  They've now admitted that our troops have tortured people to death.
[00:59:46.644 --> 00:59:53.445]  Bush pledges that will stop as they increase the funding for torture training at Fort Benning, Georgia, and admit torture.
[00:59:54.826 --> 00:59:58.067]  Record cuts, higher taxes, and states struggle to survive tough times.
[00:59:58.447 --> 01:00:05.388]  The feds are going to increase the gas tax and other taxes while cutting taxes publicly to make you think they're doing something.
[01:00:05.408 --> 01:00:07.269]  So they raise five taxes and cut one.
[01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:09.482]  Overall taxation increases.
[01:00:10.162 --> 01:00:10.862]  That's coming up.
[01:00:11.242 --> 01:00:14.344]  Also, smart cars, smart roads can help drivers.
[01:00:15.184 --> 01:00:16.444]  It is official.
[01:00:16.584 --> 01:00:19.846]  The feds say within five years they will remote control your cars.
[01:00:20.586 --> 01:00:23.607]  They say they will remote control your cars for your safety.
[01:00:24.428 --> 01:00:27.489]  So now it's not just going to be satellite tracker boxes taxing you.
[01:00:27.969 --> 01:00:29.230]  That's just to fund all this.
[01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:35.172]  Now they will remote control your cars, large stretches of road that will take full control of your cars.
[01:00:36.217 --> 01:00:40.588]  And allow you to drive at speeds of 80 to 90 miles an hour, but they'll be in control of your car.
[01:00:41.169 --> 01:00:42.693]  Doesn't that sound nice?
[01:00:43.455 --> 01:00:44.437]  Folks, it's happening.

[01:01:01.567 --> 01:01:06.849]  They already made it the law they can forcibly inoculate you in page 76 of Homeland Security.
[01:01:07.189 --> 01:01:09.270]  They're now saying the smallpox shot is safe.
[01:01:10.491 --> 01:01:12.672]  Protea appeals for UK to join the Euro.

[01:01:26.473 --> 01:01:27.153]  That's coming up.

[01:03:01.909 --> 01:03:06.456]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:03:06.676 --> 01:03:13.827]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:03:13.847 --> 01:03:17.272]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[01:03:18.532 --> 01:03:21.053]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:03:21.273 --> 01:03:28.034]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:04:46.306 --> 01:04:49.187]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:06.017 --> 01:05:07.277]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:08.138 --> 01:05:09.018]  We're back live.
[01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:10.299]  It is Friday, 27th.
[01:05:12.546 --> 01:05:20.114]  Of June 2003, and later in this hour, I want to talk about nuke program parts unearthed in Baghdad backyard.
[01:05:20.214 --> 01:05:22.216]  Now, this is from CNN.
[01:05:23.297 --> 01:05:27.021]  They've already admitted that the so-called mobile bioweapons trucks...
[01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.617]  I know our media didn't tell you, but the U.S.
[01:05:29.637 --> 01:05:41.520]  government admits it now, have been bought from the British, and they also bought some other trucks from the Russians, but the two trucks in question were bought from the British in 1985 in the middle of the Iran-Iraq War.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:48.361]  They are for pumping up dirigibles, blimps, for surveillance to direct artillery and trench warfare.
[01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:49.881]  Our government has them.
[01:05:50.541 --> 01:05:51.801]  Everybody has them.
[01:05:51.942 --> 01:05:54.202]  It's a World War I-type technology.
[01:05:55.226 --> 01:05:59.929]  They have them on the southern border to surveil drug interdiction.
[01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:07.294]  But our government knew this day one, saw the serial numbers, knew what the trucks were, and told you it was mobile bioweapons lamps.
[01:06:08.875 --> 01:06:13.798]  But there were hundreds of front-page stories, and then the retraction is about a paragraph in the back of the paper.
[01:06:13.838 --> 01:06:15.659]  That's what it was in the Austin American-Statesman.
[01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:19.188]  So now nuke program parts unearthed in Baghdad.
[01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.408]  We've been lied to so many times.
[01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:23.651]  They claim that they found them buried under a bush.
[01:06:23.871 --> 01:06:25.332]  Yes, a bush in a backyard.
[01:06:25.892 --> 01:06:34.158]  Well, it turns out that a real system, the way they describe this, covers about 100 football fields.
[01:06:34.178 --> 01:06:35.839]  It's a giant plant.
[01:06:36.799 --> 01:06:39.001]  And we have a photo on prisonplanet.com.
[01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:41.331]  That was the news from two days ago.
[01:06:41.371 --> 01:06:46.593]  You just click on the archive of what these plants really look like, and then they claim they found this in a rose bush.
[01:06:46.613 --> 01:06:51.215]  Well, let me just cover this now, and then I'll go to Brett and Roger and others that are holding.
[01:06:51.696 --> 01:06:54.277]  Nuke program parts unearthed in Baghdad backyard.
[01:06:54.297 --> 01:07:00.640]  The CIA has its hands on the critical parts of key parts of Iraq's nuclear technology.
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:05.462]  Parts needed to develop a bomb program that were dug up in the backyard in Baghdad.
[01:07:05.482 --> 01:07:07.623]  CNN has learned the parts which...
[01:07:08.797 --> 01:07:23.429]  With accompanying plans were unearthed by the Iraqi scientist Mahid Obadi, who said he had hidden them under the rose bush in his garden 12 years ago under orders from Qazi Hussein, one of Saddam Hussein's son-in-laws, Hussein Kamel.
[01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:25.375]  Or Hussein Kamel.
[01:07:25.915 --> 01:07:38.399]  CNN security correspondent David Inzor reports that under United Nations sanctions in place in 1991, the concealment of such materials and failure to disclose their presence would have constituted violations of Security Council regulations.
[01:07:38.819 --> 01:07:39.159]  But U.S.
[01:07:39.199 --> 01:07:42.420]  officials emphasize that it was not evidence that Iraq had a nuclear weapon.
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.881]  It's like a little canister.
[01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:52.303]  But it was evidence that Iraqis concealed plans to reconstruct their nuclear program as soon as the world was no longer looking.
[01:07:52.343 --> 01:07:53.423]  The parts and documents...
[01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:59.136]  The scientists at the CIA were shown exclusively on CNN at CNN headquarters in Virginia.
[01:08:00.197 --> 01:08:06.763]  Obadiah told CNN the parts for a gas centrifuge system for enriched uranium were part of a highly sophisticated system.
[01:08:07.043 --> 01:08:10.506]  He was ordered to hide to be ready to rebuild the bomb program.
[01:08:10.646 --> 01:08:13.449]  Well, we show a picture of a gas centrifuge plant
[01:08:14.352 --> 01:08:21.254]  And the actual parts in it, according to the government websites you've been to, fill entire warehouses.
[01:08:21.354 --> 01:08:27.396]  But they got some parts the size of footballs, little metal canisters, and they're saying this is it.
[01:08:28.396 --> 01:08:40.500]  Now, a few weeks ago they admitted they were so desperate to find weapons of mass destruction they were, quote, going to give amnesty and pay, in some cases millions of dollars, to people who would go public and say they were part of a nuclear program.
[01:08:41.656 --> 01:08:42.637]  Now, it gets worse.
[01:08:43.278 --> 01:08:55.290]  They reported in the BBC about two months ago that Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, was to be paid upwards of four and a half million dollars a year.
[01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:59.214]  It was almost three million pounds a year, so over four million U.S.,
[01:09:00.282 --> 01:09:13.872]  And that he was going to live on a hundred-plus-thousand-acre palace of Prince Charles and was to be given armed bodyguards, helicopter escort, into the shopping centers, into London.
[01:09:14.492 --> 01:09:15.953]  I mean, lavish lifestyle.
[01:09:17.234 --> 01:09:19.717]  If he would inform on Saddam's weapons of mass destruction.
[01:09:20.098 --> 01:09:21.559]  Now, I don't know where that story went.
[01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:23.501]  Where is Tariq Aziz?
[01:09:23.882 --> 01:09:25.724]  We hear no discussions of him now.
[01:09:26.204 --> 01:09:36.135]  They admit they paid off Iraqi Republican Guard leaders before the war in gold bars, euros, and dollars to give up before the war even started.
[01:09:36.195 --> 01:09:36.916]  That's admitted.
[01:09:36.956 --> 01:09:38.938]  Delta Force flew them out by helicopter.
[01:09:40.170 --> 01:09:44.413]  They would simply walk to an open field, the helicopter would land, they'd climb on and get out of there.
[01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:49.016]  It happened during the war, this is all admitted, but again, in the back of the paper.
[01:09:49.076 --> 01:09:51.458]  The back of the paper once, and you never hear about it again.
[01:09:52.058 --> 01:09:53.499]  So I don't believe anything they say.
[01:09:53.519 --> 01:09:58.462]  They claim that this African country sold them nuke parts, turned out the whole document was fake.
[01:09:58.863 --> 01:10:01.784]  They claimed a bakery in northern Iraq was a bioweapons lab.
[01:10:02.205 --> 01:10:04.066]  BBC went in, it was a bakery.
[01:10:04.682 --> 01:10:08.485]  They claim they had a secret document written a week before Colin Powell gave his speech.
[01:10:08.785 --> 01:10:14.849]  It turned out it was written 12 years before by a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley.
[01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:20.453]  I mean, the lies... They claim to mass graves in that warehouse.
[01:10:20.493 --> 01:10:23.415]  You know, the boxes full of sand and bones.
[01:10:24.961 --> 01:10:26.782]  Oh, look, political dissidents killed.
[01:10:27.242 --> 01:10:32.143]  Turned out it was dead Iraqis, dead Iranians, and the Iranians have an exchange program.
[01:10:32.163 --> 01:10:41.485]  They were exchanging dead found from the hundreds of thousands that died on the Iraqi side, millions that were killed on the Iranian side, over a million, in the Iran-Iraq war.
[01:10:41.585 --> 01:10:44.966]  Just like we exchange bodies with South and North Korea.
[01:10:45.406 --> 01:10:53.008]  Every couple months you hear about more bodies coming back on jets with American flags on them, usually UN flags on them, from North Korea.
[01:10:54.014 --> 01:11:03.540]  So, and I still hear neocon liars, gun grabbers, on the air going, we got mobile weapons labs, we got mass graves, we got blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.581]  They bought nuclear parts from Niger.
[01:11:06.442 --> 01:11:07.782]  And they know that's not true.
[01:11:07.802 --> 01:11:09.003]  They're not stupid.
[01:11:09.463 --> 01:11:10.844]  Probably smarter than I am.
[01:11:10.864 --> 01:11:17.248]  Folks, they're still using the same lies after they've been caught.
[01:11:17.288 --> 01:11:18.069]  Okay, let's go to the calls.
[01:11:18.109 --> 01:11:18.489]  I'm sorry.
[01:11:19.328 --> 01:11:21.989]  Brett in Connecticut, up there in Skull and Bones land.
[01:11:22.349 --> 01:11:22.929]  Welcome, Brett.
[01:11:22.949 --> 01:11:23.610]  You're on the air.
[01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:24.990]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:25.671]  Fantastic.
[01:11:25.691 --> 01:11:26.431]  How's the show going?
[01:11:26.831 --> 01:11:29.832]  Well, I'm from New York, but I'm just calling you from Connecticut.
[01:11:30.012 --> 01:11:31.293]  And the show is great, Alex.
[01:11:31.373 --> 01:11:33.013]  I'd just like to say one thing.
[01:11:33.994 --> 01:11:47.098]  I believe this might sound a little crazy to you, but I believe that President Kennedy was kind of directed by God when he protected the world pretty much from destruction during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:11:47.139 --> 01:11:48.339]  And I'd just like to say that
[01:11:49.258 --> 01:12:01.626]  I feel in a way that you're kind of the same way by trying to bring out what's happening to the people that you're being directed by God in the same way to try and save the world, essentially.
[01:12:02.227 --> 01:12:07.050]  And I'd just like to say that to you before I bring up what I was going to talk about.
[01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:09.332]  Well, Brett, let me just make a comment on that, and then I'll let you go on.
[01:12:10.773 --> 01:12:12.034]  Look, but I'm not special.
[01:12:12.314 --> 01:12:13.695]  President Kennedy wasn't special.
[01:12:13.735 --> 01:12:16.216]  We're all led by God in our lives.
[01:12:16.236 --> 01:12:18.418]  Yes, because God works through people, yes.
[01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:21.048]  This is a test.
[01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:31.130]  This is the junior varsity, the minor leagues here, before we go on to join the big team.
[01:12:32.391 --> 01:12:33.231]  Let me add something.
[01:12:34.631 --> 01:12:44.313]  Kennedy, for all his corruption and his womanizing and all the rest of it, changed his ways at the end, woke up, gave speeches at American University and other areas.
[01:12:44.333 --> 01:12:45.173]  I have copies of them.
[01:12:46.736 --> 01:12:49.939]  I have text from the National Archives, Library of Congress.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.021]  I love video of this movie.
[01:12:51.061 --> 01:12:51.601]  I can find it.
[01:12:51.641 --> 01:12:52.462]  I know it exists.
[01:12:53.003 --> 01:12:56.046]  Where he warned of a great corrupt influence that had taken over our government.
[01:12:56.546 --> 01:12:58.969]  Eisenhower warned of the military-industrial complex.
[01:12:59.549 --> 01:13:01.291]  And Kennedy was a hawk.
[01:13:02.017 --> 01:13:02.777]  We're good to go.
[01:13:18.058 --> 01:13:18.478]  The U.S.
[01:13:18.498 --> 01:13:21.779]  government plan to kill American citizens and blame it on foreign enemies.
[01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:29.020]  When he saw Northwoods in 62, that's when his whole outlook changed, and they assassinated him six months later.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:29.380]  Go ahead.
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:44.764]  Because Alex, if he had invaded the way the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted him to invade, they had tactical nuclear weapons that were on the ground in Cuba that were going to be used by the local Russian commanders.
[01:13:45.444 --> 01:13:45.984]  Exactly.
[01:13:46.604 --> 01:13:56.447]  And that would have been the end of the world, because once those attack nukes were shot against our fleet, of invasion fleet, that would have been the start of the end of the nuclear exchange, you know?
[01:13:57.148 --> 01:14:06.551]  And you're correct, and I've, again, this is documented, other people involved in the Bay of Pigs on, they were afraid that the Cubans themselves were going to overthrow Fidel.
[01:14:07.291 --> 01:14:09.272]  Good, conservative, Christian Cubans.
[01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:10.692]  And this is admitted.
[01:14:11.332 --> 01:14:16.014]  The CIA ratted them out at Bay of Pigs to defeat them, to have them on the beach, tied down,
[01:14:16.889 --> 01:14:19.891]  And they then thought Kennedy would authorize the invasion.
[01:14:20.011 --> 01:14:21.632]  Again, problem, reaction, solution.
[01:14:22.533 --> 01:14:34.141]  In fact, the Joint Chiefs even went to Kennedy, and they got green-lighted all the way up to him, and he said, no, they said, we want to attack our own Marines at Guantanamo with army dressed up as Cubans and kill Americans to get the war going.
[01:14:34.972 --> 01:14:35.412]  Amazing.
[01:14:35.633 --> 01:14:36.513]  That's Northwood, sir.
[01:14:36.553 --> 01:14:37.674]  That's a public document.
[01:14:38.134 --> 01:14:38.455]  I know.
[01:14:38.915 --> 01:14:39.375]  I've read it.
[01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:40.356]  I've seen it.
[01:14:40.656 --> 01:14:45.279]  Well, for those that don't know, I've got ABC News, Baltimore Sun, on Infowars.com reporting it.
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:47.021]  But not just that, my friend.
[01:14:47.301 --> 01:14:47.921]  Not just that.
[01:14:48.622 --> 01:14:52.004]  We have the actual Northwoods document.
[01:14:52.044 --> 01:14:52.345]  Go ahead.
[01:14:53.225 --> 01:14:59.190]  The other thing I wanted to say was, Alex, I've got your DVD of 9-1-1, Road to Tyranny, and I'm
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:06.361]  I've been giving it to some of my friends and whatnot, but I'm getting a lot of resistance.
[01:15:06.461 --> 01:15:14.483]  Some of the more educated people are more open to what you're talking about than the ones that have, like I say, a head in the sand scenario.
[01:15:16.044 --> 01:15:23.606]  There's a reason more... Other callers are calling in too, saying they're trying to say that you're paranoid and all this stuff, and it's kind of really...
[01:15:24.913 --> 01:15:30.416]  Very upsetting that these kind of things could be happening in our country and no one cares about it.
[01:15:30.456 --> 01:15:31.277]  Well, let me break that down.
[01:15:31.297 --> 01:15:32.378]  It's really upsetting.
[01:15:33.318 --> 01:15:36.740]  If you've been listening, you've heard some callers say that everyone wakes up.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:42.043]  Most callers say that a lot of folks wake up, and some say that hardly anyone wakes up.
[01:15:42.484 --> 01:15:47.227]  Now, you mentioned that... Well, no, some of them do, but you almost have to...
[01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:52.558]  You know, the less intelligent people, I guess, I don't know what it is.
[01:15:52.578 --> 01:15:54.061]  I wouldn't even say the more educated.
[01:15:54.101 --> 01:15:56.125]  I wouldn't say less intelligent.
[01:15:56.165 --> 01:15:58.370]  I would say, like you're saying, yes.
[01:15:59.444 --> 01:16:00.485]  I don't know if this is true.
[01:16:23.704 --> 01:16:25.306]  That's pretty much what I wanted to say.
[01:16:25.386 --> 01:16:26.727]  Thanks, Alex, for talking to me.
[01:16:26.767 --> 01:16:27.468]  I appreciate it.
[01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:32.052]  Hey, God bless you, and thanks for the support, and keep making copies of the films, and keep spreading the word.
[01:16:32.573 --> 01:16:33.494]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:16:33.534 --> 01:16:36.256]  We'll come back and talk to Roger and others, and I'll get into some more news.
[01:16:36.897 --> 01:16:41.882]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are the websites, and I know I'm... Well, we'll be right back.
[01:16:43.078 --> 01:16:46.961]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:16:47.181 --> 01:16:52.626]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:16:52.906 --> 01:17:03.294]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:17:03.454 --> 01:17:07.778]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:17:07.978 --> 01:17:16.321]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:17:16.601 --> 01:17:22.924]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:17:23.064 --> 01:17:23.304]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:17:44.167 --> 01:17:50.116]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:17:50.336 --> 01:17:52.599]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:59.149]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:17:59.469 --> 01:18:00.130]  We're good to go.
[01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:24.653]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[01:18:41.909 --> 01:18:45.712]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[01:18:46.012 --> 01:18:52.957]  Use a Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and a Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.
[01:18:53.237 --> 01:18:54.778]  Take control of your own destiny.
[01:18:54.938 --> 01:18:59.421]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[01:18:59.562 --> 01:19:00.862]  This is more than a handbook.
[01:19:01.043 --> 01:19:04.345]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[01:19:04.745 --> 01:19:05.446]  Here's the deal.
[01:19:05.686 --> 01:19:16.938]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend, and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[01:19:17.178 --> 01:19:23.105]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918 and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:29.372]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[01:19:29.712 --> 01:19:33.577]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:19:33.937 --> 01:19:35.799]  Ask for the Freedom Handbook Special.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.501]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:37.701]  Thank you.
[01:19:41.005 --> 01:19:49.291]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:49.532 --> 01:19:53.895]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:54.175 --> 01:20:03.102]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:20:03.302 --> 01:20:06.925]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:20:07.205 --> 01:20:12.251]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:20:12.531 --> 01:20:19.279]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:20:19.759 --> 01:20:20.300]  What about you?
[01:20:21.039 --> 01:20:26.404]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:20:27.625 --> 01:20:29.527]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:49.561]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:50.042 --> 01:20:52.864]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:56.026 --> 01:21:02.290]  A lot of times on the weekend, I tune into a local rebroadcast of my show on News Talk 1260.
[01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:09.675]  KWNX, I carry my show seven days a week, live at night, and then on Saturdays and Sundays from 3 to 6.
[01:21:12.299 --> 01:21:26.750]  In the afternoon, I get a chance to hear my show, and great callers call in like Brent, and they try to make their points, and then I start running over them, and it sounds to me sometimes like I'm trying to show off with information.
[01:21:26.811 --> 01:21:27.251]  I'm not.
[01:21:27.851 --> 01:21:34.937]  I have this instinctive need to stop callers when they're making a good point and to add information and sources and documents to it
[01:21:35.586 --> 01:21:39.287]  Because I know people are driving around out there listening and they're going, oh, this is just made up.
[01:21:39.327 --> 01:21:40.047]  It's ridiculous.
[01:21:40.107 --> 01:21:41.148]  No, it's not made up.
[01:21:41.608 --> 01:21:42.708]  It's historical fact.
[01:21:42.768 --> 01:21:44.809]  You better check out what we're saying.
[01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:47.729]  And, you know, frankly, I've listened to other shows.
[01:21:47.890 --> 01:21:51.110]  Overall, I let callers say more than 90% of talk shows.
[01:21:51.631 --> 01:21:55.112]  I just interrupt people and add my points and then let them go on.
[01:21:55.992 --> 01:21:59.053]  And I just thought about how I was behaving in the last segment.
[01:21:59.093 --> 01:22:00.233]  I appreciate Brent's call.
[01:22:00.253 --> 01:22:03.674]  I was just trying to throw information in there because it's so important.
[01:22:04.858 --> 01:22:06.620]  And it really is an information overload.
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.560]  I mean, look at these articles.
[01:22:07.701 --> 01:22:09.162]  Unlimited power of arrest.
[01:22:10.043 --> 01:22:21.192]  Australia's domestic intelligence agency, ASIO, will have aggressive new powers from today to detain, for an unlimited period, citizens suspected of having information about terrorist offenses.
[01:22:21.773 --> 01:22:24.395]  It says that a judge is secretly impaneled.
[01:22:24.595 --> 01:22:30.641]  A retired judge, you can be secretly arrested and secretly held for up to five years with no charges.
[01:22:32.057 --> 01:22:35.020]  If the judge believes you're not being forthcoming.
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.402]  And it says this will go for the press.
[01:22:37.462 --> 01:22:38.703]  And it's not just for terror.
[01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:40.364]  It's for all crime.
[01:22:40.905 --> 01:22:43.687]  You notice they took most of the guns a few years ago in Australia.
[01:22:44.168 --> 01:22:45.289]  Same thing's happening here.
[01:22:45.309 --> 01:22:48.652]  I mean, I could spend an hour on this article.
[01:22:49.512 --> 01:22:50.253]  I got a bunch of them.
[01:22:50.293 --> 01:22:51.354]  New law on terrorism.
[01:22:51.754 --> 01:22:53.556]  Racist specter of agency abuse.
[01:22:53.796 --> 01:22:54.277]  Abuse.
[01:22:55.598 --> 01:22:56.238]  Another article.
[01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:57.900]  Unlimited power of arrest.
[01:22:59.309 --> 01:23:06.693]  I got articles here about how the feds announced they're going to remote control your cars and control them on the highways now, not just satellite track and tax them, AP.
[01:23:06.713 --> 01:23:10.235]  I mean, folks, this is bunker land crazy.
[01:23:11.516 --> 01:23:17.019]  They're going to make you tag and control your cows and sheep, and they're going to inspect them, the homeland security is.
[01:23:17.039 --> 01:23:18.900]  It has nothing to do with protecting us.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.281]  The border's wide open.
[01:23:21.033 --> 01:23:23.674]  It's about taxing and control and feudalism.
[01:23:24.034 --> 01:23:25.154]  Folks, this is horrible.
[01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:30.735]  Government is expanding in a thousand directions, taking everything over, and they call it conservative.
[01:23:31.675 --> 01:23:35.756]  Let's talk to Roger and then Wyatt and Ron and Spencer and others.
[01:23:36.196 --> 01:23:38.297]  Roger, you're on the air from Pennsylvania.
[01:23:38.797 --> 01:23:39.637]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[01:23:39.717 --> 01:23:48.919]  I just had a laugh left over from the last call because the New Testament says, "...forever learning, never understanding."
[01:23:50.134 --> 01:24:01.318]  And, you know, when the commie Chinese tried to take over the Mongolians, they had kind of a problem there because Mongolians weren't exposed to these sophist, flowery political theories.
[01:24:02.278 --> 01:24:04.099]  And so they said, well, let me get this straight.
[01:24:04.119 --> 01:24:07.480]  You're going to take all our produce and give it back to us as we need it?
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.581]  So they weren't educated yet out of their common sense.
[01:24:14.094 --> 01:24:22.558]  Well, I think by educated, people that see The Road to Tyranny, that know history, that know its facts, that have seen the documents themselves, are like, wow, I already knew that.
[01:24:23.159 --> 01:24:26.100]  I think he's talking about ignorant people don't respond.
[01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:30.203]  Yeah, I know, but it takes a certain amount of education to be duped as well.
[01:24:30.223 --> 01:24:31.263]  That was my point.
[01:24:32.124 --> 01:24:32.564]  But anyway.
[01:24:35.246 --> 01:24:38.669]  You didn't quite state this on whether you're talking.
[01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:44.334]  I forget if the head of the INS is still the Clinton hangover, but that's... It doesn't matter.
[01:24:44.394 --> 01:24:45.715]  Bush loves Clinton people.
[01:24:46.136 --> 01:24:59.967]  Well, the point I wanted to help clarify here is, whether it's that or the head of the Border Patrol or the head of the State Department, and you've got to dismiss this notion that, say, the State Department has a life of its own.
[01:25:01.008 --> 01:25:01.649]  Well, it will...
[01:25:02.997 --> 01:25:11.341]  It does have its own agenda, if left to its own devices, which happens to be the exact same identical... Oh, they always claim that the State Department did something bad.
[01:25:11.441 --> 01:25:13.062]  Oh, it's this other federal agency.
[01:25:13.102 --> 01:25:15.062]  They're the ones destroying our sovereignty.
[01:25:15.323 --> 01:25:16.323]  Thanks for the call, Roger.
[01:25:16.563 --> 01:25:17.203]  Got to let you go.
[01:25:17.303 --> 01:25:17.964]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:18.344 --> 01:25:19.244]  Wyatt, Maryland.
[01:25:19.304 --> 01:25:20.025]  Wyatt, go ahead.
[01:25:20.045 --> 01:25:20.645]  You're on the air.
[01:25:20.825 --> 01:25:21.085]  Hey, Donal.
[01:25:21.145 --> 01:25:21.805]  It's a good afternoon.
[01:25:23.006 --> 01:25:29.189]  I heard on another station there was a scare up in Saskatchewan County...
[01:25:30.621 --> 01:25:40.068]  Saskatchewan, Canada, that they were quarantining sheep for scrapies, which is like Mad Cow.
[01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:42.109]  I don't know what they're doing there.
[01:25:42.129 --> 01:25:49.575]  Well, they had Mad Cow pop up in Saskatchewan province, and now it showed up, according to the Billings Gazette, in Nebraska.
[01:25:50.456 --> 01:25:50.656]  Right.
[01:25:50.676 --> 01:25:53.537]  Well, that's what they're going to be using, just like they did with the hoof and mouth.
[01:25:53.958 --> 01:26:00.400]  Oh, they said the feds are going to take over all cows and sheep, so they know what you own, so they can come kill it later.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.962]  And, of course, it was the British government that was caught releasing foot and mouth.
[01:26:04.282 --> 01:26:05.682]  Source on that, London Telegraph.
[01:26:05.722 --> 01:26:08.083]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:26:08.103 --> 01:26:08.604]  Yeah.
[01:26:08.624 --> 01:26:09.064]  Have you heard?
[01:26:09.504 --> 01:26:14.266]  What's the story with the chemical warfare trucks that were brought into the Soda National Park?
[01:26:14.286 --> 01:26:15.827]  I haven't heard anything from that anymore.
[01:26:15.847 --> 01:26:19.228]  Remember when they were in a customs lot?
[01:26:19.708 --> 01:26:20.889]  It was hundreds and hundreds of vehicles.
[01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:24.390]  Yeah, why don't you recap the listeners' memory on that.
[01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:25.050]  Stay there, Wyatt.
[01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.571]  Don't hang up.
[01:26:26.091 --> 01:26:26.871]  Come back and let you finish.
[01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:29.432]  We've got Glenn Spencer coming on, but we'll go right to your calls, too.
[01:26:29.812 --> 01:26:31.093]  Ron and Spencer and others.
[01:26:31.113 --> 01:26:31.693]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:33.634 --> 01:26:34.554]  We're on the march.
[01:26:35.015 --> 01:26:36.635]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.556 --> 01:26:40.237]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.832 --> 01:26:46.955]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:50.678]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio is the answer.
[01:26:50.698 --> 01:26:53.741]  Featuring continuous tuning for all shortwave frequencies.
[01:26:53.761 --> 01:26:53.801]  888-803-4438.
[01:26:53.861 --> 01:26:55.142]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:26:55.182 --> 01:26:55.422]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:27:06.457 --> 01:27:12.480]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:16.082]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:19.043 --> 01:27:23.025]  The federal government is passing laws where citizens have absolutely no rights.
[01:27:23.966 --> 01:27:34.811]  They're doing it in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, while bringing in masses of illegal aliens and accepting fake ID cards.
[01:27:35.655 --> 01:27:39.117]  And I've noticed, whatever happens in Australia happens here, happens in England.
[01:27:40.138 --> 01:27:42.099]  All being deployed at different rates.
[01:27:42.239 --> 01:27:50.004]  Some things that are employed by the government, put into effect, activated, authorized, happen here in the U.S.
[01:27:50.024 --> 01:27:55.688]  before they happen in the U.K., or they happen before they happen here, they'll happen in Australia.
[01:27:56.627 --> 01:28:09.071]  And I've got articles here where you have absolutely no rights, police are being militarized, all this is happening, while illegals get more and more welfare, tuition, health care, everything you can imagine.
[01:28:10.032 --> 01:28:24.157]  In the last hour at Colorado, Senate President John Andrews talked about how another congressman from Iowa has been at town hall meetings and has talked to witnesses and has talked to community leaders who say, this is Mexico,
[01:28:25.029 --> 01:28:27.711]  And we're getting rid of America, and that's just the way it is.
[01:28:28.591 --> 01:28:30.532]  So Mexico has been so arrogant.
[01:28:30.572 --> 01:28:38.957]  The Fortune 500 that's funding the breakup of America has been so arrogant that people are starting to wake up across the board.
[01:28:38.977 --> 01:28:40.858]  This is part of the New World Order.
[01:28:41.378 --> 01:28:46.601]  As Glenn Spencer says, our sovereignty is being sacrificed on the altar of globalism.
[01:28:47.442 --> 01:28:51.344]  So Glenn Spencer is coming up in a few minutes from AmericanPatrol.com.
[01:28:51.364 --> 01:28:52.445]  Just amazing folks.
[01:28:53.226 --> 01:28:54.287]  Really having an effect.
[01:28:54.307 --> 01:29:13.923]  We'll talk about their activities and Glenn's expert analysis of the situation, the state of the country right now, and this all-important issue of the borders and sovereignty, and the billions, not the millions, the billions of people that are trying to come to this country and the 25 million illegals that are here right now.
[01:29:15.345 --> 01:29:20.429]  But I did want to give a caller who didn't have much time, about a minute or so, to finish up the point he was making.
[01:29:21.078 --> 01:29:29.735]  Before I do that, though, I've got at least once today to put a plug in for my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:29:30.276 --> 01:29:32.621]  It is 2 hours and 40 minutes long.
[01:29:33.823 --> 01:29:51.785]  It covers how the border is wide open while the government passes Patriot Act 1 and introduces Patriot Act 2, what the executive orders do, what Homeland Security does, how this affects our republic, the FEMA camps, the foreign troops, the deals to bring in Mexican and Canadian troops, mainstream news stories.
[01:29:53.687 --> 01:29:56.468]  Government-sponsored terrorism to destroy our liberties.
[01:29:56.588 --> 01:29:57.468]  It goes on and on.
[01:29:57.528 --> 01:29:58.568]  Police State 3.
[01:29:59.008 --> 01:30:00.008]  Total enslavement.
[01:30:00.068 --> 01:30:02.469]  An amazing new film I've produced.
[01:30:02.909 --> 01:30:04.969]  I also have 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:06.430]  The Masters of Terror.
[01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:09.891]  Two films covering 9-1-1 and what really happened there.
[01:30:09.991 --> 01:30:12.131]  Such an important thing to be informed on.
[01:30:13.311 --> 01:30:15.372]  I have my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:30:15.392 --> 01:30:16.052]  230 pages.
[01:30:16.172 --> 01:30:19.913]  Also covers September 11th and different facets we didn't cover in the films.
[01:30:20.713 --> 01:30:20.853]  It's...
[01:30:23.622 --> 01:30:28.805]  The films are $25.95, but if you order three or more, they drop down to $20.
[01:30:29.265 --> 01:30:32.507]  And your purchase supports this broadcast and what we're doing.
[01:30:33.067 --> 01:30:45.915]  So if you believe in what we're doing, get the films, make copies for non-profit, not for sale purposes, and hand them out to your friends and family, your county commissioners, your talk show hosts, opinion makers, and effect change.
[01:30:47.376 --> 01:30:52.058]  Don't stand idly by and wish years from now that you would have done something.
[01:30:52.159 --> 01:30:53.959]  We can stop the globalists.
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:55.940]  We can control our borders.
[01:30:56.421 --> 01:30:58.482]  We can reaffirm the Second Amendment.
[01:30:58.522 --> 01:31:05.045]  We can get out of the Patriot Act and do sensible things to stop terror if you'll take action.
[01:31:05.065 --> 01:31:08.147]  And the films are the best tool we have found to do it.
[01:31:08.867 --> 01:31:14.290]  So go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order the videos.
[01:31:15.032 --> 01:31:16.013]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:16.033 --> 01:31:16.753]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:31:29.318 --> 01:31:40.645]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:31:42.285 --> 01:31:43.366]  Please take action.
[01:31:43.746 --> 01:31:45.527]  Please order the videos today.
[01:31:46.488 --> 01:31:51.731]  Now, real quick, Wyatt, you were trying to talk about a story where they found these chemical weapon lab trucks.
[01:31:52.563 --> 01:32:00.205]  And the government had let them through, and they were held at some base, and you wanted to comment on that, talking about national security.
[01:32:00.245 --> 01:32:01.065]  Go ahead real quick.
[01:32:01.185 --> 01:32:05.306]  Yeah, there was a story, I think it broke around 94 through 96.
[01:32:06.107 --> 01:32:19.370]  It was in Mississippi, and there was, I think it was in the DeSoto National Park, one portion of it, the big park, National Park, that there was about 200 to 300 chemical warfare trucks
[01:32:19.969 --> 01:32:31.719]  That were imported from Eastern Bloc countries and brought over and stored in a customs lot in the middle, not in the middle, but inside this national park.
[01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:33.360]  Yeah, let me comment on that.
[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:35.582]  I've got to let you go because we've got Glenn Spencer waiting wide.
[01:32:35.622 --> 01:32:36.443]  It's a good question.
[01:32:37.024 --> 01:32:40.907]  We have photos of that on Infowars.com in the photos section.
[01:32:41.948 --> 01:32:45.551]  We have photos of concentration camps marked in Russian.
[01:32:47.205 --> 01:32:52.289]  And then I have video, and I'm talking about barbed wire, machine gun nests, guard towers.
[01:32:52.929 --> 01:33:06.598]  And then, if that's not enough for you, in police state to the takeover, I have cooperative nugget 96 and 97 with foreign troops, Czechoslovakian, Russian, and others, admittedly with the top general, the U.S.
[01:33:06.638 --> 01:33:11.722]  general, saying, you are the forces of the New World Order, and this is for domestic action.
[01:33:12.202 --> 01:33:13.503]  So that is going on.
[01:33:13.823 --> 01:33:14.544]  Now it's official.
[01:33:15.217 --> 01:33:16.338]  All right, wanted to get that out of the way.
[01:33:16.398 --> 01:33:20.800]  I appreciate Glenn Spencer holding, and coming up we'll get to Ron and Spencer and others that are holding.
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:35.426]  But right now, Glenn Spencer of AmericanPatrol.com, the organization American Border Patrol, and they stand up against the racist Hispanic Ku Klux Klan of Mecha and La Raza.
[01:33:36.287 --> 01:33:38.348]  They have Hispanic members, black members, you name it.
[01:33:38.368 --> 01:33:40.769]  A lot of my friends are members right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:33:41.627 --> 01:33:42.367]  We're good to go.
[01:33:42.487 --> 01:33:42.647]  I think?
[01:34:09.699 --> 01:34:12.920]  And we had Grijalva on, and of course he said that the U.S.
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:14.161]  really does belong to Mexico.
[01:34:14.201 --> 01:34:15.041]  That's a congressman.
[01:34:15.441 --> 01:34:19.223]  Glenn Spencer, good to have you on the show and to give us your analysis of what's going on.
[01:34:21.764 --> 01:34:27.506]  Well, someone once said it's a good thing God designed time, invented time, because everything would happen at once.
[01:34:28.327 --> 01:34:33.489]  But it seems that everything is being compressed in time because there is so much going on at once right now.
[01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:35.490]  We have the border wars.
[01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:36.830]  We have the info wars.
[01:34:37.450 --> 01:34:38.591]  We have the Mexican...
[01:34:39.358 --> 01:34:40.078]  We're good to go.
[01:34:40.138 --> 01:34:40.319]  I think?
[01:35:06.818 --> 01:35:09.059]  To essentially make a last stand.
[01:35:09.639 --> 01:35:11.440]  And we're having a great deal of success.
[01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:15.422]  Glenn, break it down for us.
[01:35:15.582 --> 01:35:17.663]  What is this border issue?
[01:35:17.683 --> 01:35:19.264]  What's behind it?
[01:35:19.984 --> 01:35:22.746]  And are we now seeing people begin to wake up to this?
[01:35:25.367 --> 01:35:29.729]  Nothing can explain it better than a reporter who was here yesterday.
[01:35:29.749 --> 01:35:33.291]  His name was Luke Turf.
[01:35:33.451 --> 01:35:35.972]  He's a border reporter for the Tucson Citizen.
[01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:36.930]  I think so.
[01:35:58.394 --> 01:35:59.455]  He saw what we were doing.
[01:35:59.495 --> 01:36:12.224]  He saw our high technology, our unmanned aerial vehicles, our border sensors, our satellite Internet system, and he said, my gosh, the idea that they would be calling you vigilantes is silly.
[01:36:13.084 --> 01:36:15.006]  But as he really warmed up, he said this.
[01:36:16.006 --> 01:36:18.068]  He said, I want you to understand something.
[01:36:18.448 --> 01:36:25.753]  I'm a reporter, but I will tell you that if you continue to do what you are doing here,
[01:36:26.577 --> 01:36:28.398]  This could be the biggest story of the year.
[01:36:29.338 --> 01:36:35.221]  Because you have to understand, he said the Border Patrol is one of the most secretive agencies in the government.
[01:36:36.141 --> 01:36:40.503]  He said their newspaper, a Gannett newspaper, can't get anything out of them.
[01:36:41.203 --> 01:36:43.905]  They requested just a copy of their budget.
[01:36:44.725 --> 01:36:47.346]  They refused to release a copy of their budget.
[01:36:48.126 --> 01:36:51.168]  They had to submit a Freedom of Information Act request.
[01:36:51.708 --> 01:36:53.909]  They said it would take two years
[01:36:54.801 --> 01:37:03.826]  The Border Patrol is being run by a bunch of anti-Americans who do not want America to know what's going on at the border.
[01:37:03.907 --> 01:37:11.231]  What we are about to do here, Alex, is cut through that nonsense and tell America directly.
[01:37:11.986 --> 01:37:13.627]  How many people are crossing the border?
[01:37:14.107 --> 01:37:15.188]  Where they are crossing?
[01:37:15.268 --> 01:37:17.069]  We will show you pictures of them.
[01:37:17.489 --> 01:37:23.953]  We will get an actual count and we will find out who and when and what.
[01:37:25.589 --> 01:37:26.210]  And we're doing it.
[01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:32.134]  Now, Glenn Spencer, your description sounds like the Batcave, and it's great, and it didn't grow overnight.
[01:37:32.314 --> 01:37:32.555]  No.
[01:37:32.735 --> 01:37:46.306]  You were instrumental with others in the front lines getting the different propositions passed to watch Gray Davis just throw them out as a dictator, and they're now saying that it may, quote, be illegal to have a recall, it's criminal to have a recall.
[01:37:46.346 --> 01:37:47.707]  The Democrats are trying to say that.
[01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.690]  Right.
[01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:48.991]  Right.
[01:37:49.011 --> 01:37:49.211]  Right.
[01:38:04.868 --> 01:38:04.928]  Yes.
[01:38:04.948 --> 01:38:05.048]  Right.
[01:38:05.088 --> 01:38:05.168]  Yes.
[01:38:28.839 --> 01:38:30.900]  There's foreign troops running around down there.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:32.281]  You know, mainstream news.
[01:38:32.701 --> 01:38:33.741]  All of this is happening.
[01:38:33.801 --> 01:38:36.022]  So over the years, you've built this up.
[01:38:36.082 --> 01:38:38.783]  You've got your sensors on people's ranches and areas.
[01:38:38.823 --> 01:38:41.164]  You've got your drones, private drones.
[01:38:41.704 --> 01:38:44.045]  The government's drones are going to be used to watch our cities.
[01:38:44.306 --> 01:38:44.506]  Right.
[01:38:44.766 --> 01:38:55.250]  You're down there fighting, and you're showing people what they don't want the American people to know, that while they tell us to give up our liberty for security and give up our rights, that there is no border.
[01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:57.411]  Oh, there's no question about it.
[01:38:58.030 --> 01:39:04.640]  I mean, we have our first batch of 25 sensors.
[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:06.683]  This is a brand-new design.
[01:39:07.427 --> 01:39:07.867]  Yes, we are.
[01:39:32.245 --> 01:39:32.626]  We're good to go.
[01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:55.090]  I think so.
[01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:26.794]  As I said on CNN the other day, on the Wolf Blitzer Report, if we have to embarrass our country, our government, to do its job, so be it.
[01:40:28.038 --> 01:40:29.538]  And we are getting the attention.
[01:40:29.979 --> 01:40:33.199]  Just as you were calling, I got a call from ABC News in Phoenix.
[01:40:33.579 --> 01:40:34.980]  They're sending a crew down there.
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:41.862]  We have sent live video images from our UAV out over Lester Holt Live on MSNBC.
[01:40:41.882 --> 01:40:53.865]  So millions of people can look right down on the border from our airplane in a high-resolution camera, car camera, and see people walking along this trail leading into the United States.
[01:40:54.485 --> 01:40:55.505]  And we did that live.
[01:40:56.318 --> 01:41:01.819]  And, of course, we were on with Michael Savage, also on MSNBC.
[01:41:02.579 --> 01:41:04.800]  We were on CNN the other night.
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:08.021]  Blitzer had, again, live pictures of our U.S.
[01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:12.822]  I think we just lost Glenn's cell phone.
[01:41:13.802 --> 01:41:14.582]  Bad connection.
[01:41:14.602 --> 01:41:17.843]  We'll try to reconnect and get Glenn Spencer back on.
[01:41:19.224 --> 01:41:30.327]  And you notice the neocons will talk about some of the real issues and have good folks like Glenn Spencer on, but in the end equation, they don't put the heat on Lord Bush, who can stop all this basically instantaneously.
[01:41:31.647 --> 01:41:34.468]  And they've now ordered Border Patrol not to stop the illegals.
[01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:37.969]  They've ordered them instead to go out on trash detail and pick up trash.
[01:41:38.970 --> 01:41:43.591]  They've ordered them not to shoot back at Mexican troops, in some cases are 20 miles over the border shooting at them.
[01:41:44.151 --> 01:41:47.712]  Federal officers, Border Patrol, Park Service have been killed.
[01:41:48.499 --> 01:41:54.924]  They're shooting up vehicles on a weekly basis, multiple times monthly, the foreign troops are.
[01:41:56.005 --> 01:41:57.166]  And this is the reality.
[01:41:58.247 --> 01:42:01.209]  This is the reality of what's happening.
[01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:07.835]  And then we have a congressman from right there in Arizona, Grillhalva, saying that, hey, this is Mexico.
[01:42:09.392 --> 01:42:34.490]  So this is the reality, my friends, and the majority of Americans, regardless of color, know this is common sense, know you don't have a country without borders and sovereignty, and we have got to support what Glenn Spencer and others are doing, and by Glenn having these sensors and these drones and these cameras and just showing in their little corner of this fight what's happening, it shows how the Border Patrol is doing nothing.
[01:42:35.130 --> 01:42:36.231]  Glenn, good to have you back on.
[01:42:36.731 --> 01:42:37.832]  Sorry, we got disconnected.
[01:42:38.442 --> 01:42:40.564]  I don't know where we were because I was on a monologue.
[01:42:40.984 --> 01:42:44.247]  No, well, you were making a lot of good points is what you were doing.
[01:42:44.287 --> 01:42:48.971]  But Glenn, now... Oh, oh, oh, just a second.
[01:42:49.171 --> 01:42:50.452]  Did you hear that?
[01:42:51.673 --> 01:42:51.954]  Yes.
[01:42:52.054 --> 01:42:54.075]  Okay, that is our sensor going off.
[01:42:55.176 --> 01:42:59.980]  Okay, this is right down by the San Pedro River coming into Arizona.
[01:43:00.681 --> 01:43:02.002]  We just picked up five people.
[01:43:03.703 --> 01:43:04.284]  You just heard it.
[01:43:05.105 --> 01:43:05.825]  Five people?
[01:43:06.065 --> 01:43:06.606]  Five people.
[01:43:07.916 --> 01:43:08.076]  Wow.
[01:43:08.136 --> 01:43:09.997]  Our sensors are computerized and we count them.
[01:43:11.719 --> 01:43:12.299]  You just heard it.
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:15.821]  Yes, I did.
[01:43:16.142 --> 01:43:18.183]  And it flashes up on a computer screen.
[01:43:18.483 --> 01:43:21.345]  It gives the exact location and the exact number of people.
[01:43:21.865 --> 01:43:24.527]  And now on national TV you've had your drones out.
[01:43:24.587 --> 01:43:25.048]  No, this is not.
[01:43:25.708 --> 01:43:29.571]  We're not sending this out right yet until we get all of our testing done.
[01:43:29.911 --> 01:43:30.631]  I'm talking about your drones.
[01:43:30.651 --> 01:43:31.532]  This is captured right here.
[01:43:32.651 --> 01:43:36.194]  But we will eventually... But we will not do this.
[01:43:36.274 --> 01:43:42.118]  We will not give the actual locations up on the Internet, and there's a reason for that.
[01:43:43.019 --> 01:43:49.504]  These people are attacked, murdered, and robbed by Mexican bandits, no matter where they are.
[01:43:50.364 --> 01:43:56.649]  And if we showed them where they were, they would be subject to attack, not by Americans, but by their own countrymen.
[01:43:57.069 --> 01:43:58.490]  Yeah, by the coyotes.
[01:43:58.610 --> 01:43:59.331]  By the coyotes.
[01:44:00.777 --> 01:44:04.921]  So we will show live video pictures eventually.
[01:44:05.121 --> 01:44:06.923]  Well, we can do it now, but we don't do it every day.
[01:44:06.943 --> 01:44:08.124]  That's what I was talking about.
[01:44:08.144 --> 01:44:11.387]  We can even look down and see them, but you won't know exactly where they are.
[01:44:12.673 --> 01:44:16.595]  We don't give the exact location to anyone except the Border Patrol.
[01:44:17.016 --> 01:44:18.977]  Now, what about Morris Sleaze?
[01:44:19.277 --> 01:44:19.677]  Oh, gosh.
[01:44:19.837 --> 01:44:26.641]  He's trying to shut down Americans, showing the federal crimes being committed by the tens of thousands every day.
[01:44:26.661 --> 01:44:27.101]  Right.
[01:44:27.381 --> 01:44:28.602]  What's going on with him right now?
[01:44:29.022 --> 01:44:29.963]  Well, he's after us.
[01:44:30.323 --> 01:44:31.083]  He's after me.
[01:44:31.103 --> 01:44:40.789]  He and the Southern Poverty Law Center have tied up, have joined in with a gal by the name of Isabel Garcia and her group, Derechos Humanos.
[01:44:42.633 --> 01:44:44.835]  It said rights, you know, human rights.
[01:44:45.956 --> 01:44:55.466]  Yeah, if you don't put water centers out there and emergency packs and don't give them magically a first-class railway ticket in here, you're evil.
[01:44:56.467 --> 01:44:57.468]  Just stay there, Glenn Spencer.
[01:44:57.488 --> 01:45:00.571]  We'll talk about it on the other side when we get back and talk more about those drones.
[01:45:03.766 --> 01:45:08.049]  Every cell of the body has a receptor site for our master hormone called growth hormone.
[01:45:08.469 --> 01:45:11.551]  The role of growth hormone is to instruct the cells to repair.
[01:45:11.952 --> 01:45:16.975]  This hormone is in the highest concentrations in the body between the ages of infancy and your early twenties.
[01:45:17.375 --> 01:45:20.778]  Hence, this is the major reason why the body repairs so well when young.
[01:45:21.359 --> 01:45:22.080]  We're good to go.
[01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:22.701]  We're good to go.
[01:45:34.463 --> 01:45:37.204]  Cocoon GH is a sublingual form of growth hormone.
[01:45:37.584 --> 01:45:49.708]  When used twice a day, people report deep sleep, improved mood, memory and energy, losses of body fat, improved strength and sex drive, reduction of joint pains, improved blood sugar, and more.
[01:45:49.968 --> 01:45:51.969]  Improve your chemistry and improve your life.
[01:45:52.169 --> 01:45:53.510]  Satisfaction guaranteed.
[01:45:53.630 --> 01:45:53.890]  Call 800-814-5031.
[01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.950]  800-814-5031.
[01:45:53.970 --> 01:45:54.010]  800-814-5031.
[01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:14.685]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:46:14.865 --> 01:46:22.471]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:22.731 --> 01:46:25.833]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:46:25.993 --> 01:46:26.393]  We're good to go.
[01:46:44.662 --> 01:46:50.610]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:46:50.850 --> 01:46:55.116]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:46:55.136 --> 01:46:55.736]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:47:03.606 --> 01:47:07.928]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:08.108 --> 01:47:12.550]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:17.052]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:47:17.092 --> 01:47:18.453]  The New World Order.
[01:47:20.234 --> 01:47:24.456]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:47:24.516 --> 01:47:31.461]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:47:31.581 --> 01:47:33.622]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:34.002 --> 01:47:44.368]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:47:44.588 --> 01:47:45.469]  If you want to understand
[01:47:45.689 --> 01:47:46.010]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:47:46.050 --> 01:47:47.371]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:48:12.262 --> 01:48:16.304]  Listeners can probably hear Glenn Spencer and myself hyperventilating on the air.
[01:48:16.324 --> 01:48:17.565]  Glenn said, I don't know where to start.
[01:48:17.585 --> 01:48:18.346]  There's so much.
[01:48:19.246 --> 01:48:20.707]  Time is being compressed.
[01:48:20.767 --> 01:48:22.308]  He talks about a last stand.
[01:48:23.188 --> 01:48:26.950]  You're not in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California.
[01:48:27.571 --> 01:48:28.631]  You don't know, folks.
[01:48:28.671 --> 01:48:29.772]  There is no border.
[01:48:30.873 --> 01:48:33.014]  There are tens of millions of people trying to come here.
[01:48:34.165 --> 01:48:34.725]  We're good to go.
[01:48:34.745 --> 01:48:35.446]  We're good to go.
[01:48:51.059 --> 01:48:54.461]  And Glenn Morris Dees, I mean, the guy is a piece of work.
[01:48:54.501 --> 01:48:59.685]  His training manuals say that constitutionalists, gun owners, people that don't like the U.N.
[01:48:59.745 --> 01:49:00.185]  are bad.
[01:49:00.625 --> 01:49:09.211]  They're demonizing whole classes of society, but defending Mecha and La Raza, truly racist organizations.
[01:49:09.271 --> 01:49:11.333]  I mean, La Raza means the race.
[01:49:11.453 --> 01:49:14.495]  Mecha says, you know, push all the whites out, kill them.
[01:49:14.515 --> 01:49:16.356]  They said it on TV, on their websites.
[01:49:16.956 --> 01:49:17.938]  This is wrong.
[01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:27.390]  I've spoken out against the Klan and spoken out against everybody, but how did they get this free ride, and are we starting to see a shift to them not getting a free ride?
[01:49:28.651 --> 01:49:31.715]  Well, I don't see it.
[01:49:33.217 --> 01:49:35.400]  I see Americans getting the shaft.
[01:49:36.178 --> 01:49:37.659]  Well, they're still getting the free ride.
[01:49:37.719 --> 01:49:41.962]  I know people who are ill, cannot get in to see doctors.
[01:49:42.682 --> 01:49:53.629]  We know in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, if you go to a hospital and you're not a resident of Los Angeles County, they will throw you out, even though you're a U.S.
[01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:54.090]  citizen.
[01:49:54.530 --> 01:50:00.834]  But if you go to a hospital in Los Angeles County, you happen to have a county address, and you're an illegal alien, they take you in.
[01:50:01.234 --> 01:50:03.656]  So they're throwing out citizens onto the street,
[01:50:04.796 --> 01:50:06.557]  And taking care of illegal aliens.
[01:50:06.998 --> 01:50:09.179]  So I don't see any reversal in this.
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:17.503]  Well, I have to tell you... I have to tell you... It just depends on how far you can push the American people.
[01:50:17.963 --> 01:50:21.285]  Apparently, you can push them into the ocean before they do anything.
[01:50:21.807 --> 01:50:22.908]  That's what we're getting to see.
[01:50:23.068 --> 01:50:26.270]  And by the way, while we were talking, we got another hit on a sensor.
[01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:29.371]  A few, about a mile away from the other one.
[01:50:29.651 --> 01:50:30.552]  A group coming in.
[01:50:30.872 --> 01:50:34.734]  They come up this San Pedro River because it's lined with trees out here in the desert.
[01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:36.375]  And it has trees on either side.
[01:50:36.675 --> 01:50:39.277]  And they walk up and the Border Patrol knows they come up there.
[01:50:40.330 --> 01:50:41.712]  But they don't do anything about it.
[01:50:41.793 --> 01:50:47.622]  Now we're going to be flying our drones over that river on a regular basis and sending pictures back.
[01:50:47.642 --> 01:50:51.328]  We'll say, here they are, here they are, here they are, and where's the border patrol?
[01:50:51.689 --> 01:50:53.452]  We're going to do that every day and every night.
[01:50:54.605 --> 01:50:55.486]  But Glenn... But Glenn... But Glenn...
[01:51:15.353 --> 01:51:21.454]  In the heartland of America, they set up checkpoints and search everybody's car and throw our goods out on the road.
[01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:28.996]  And when they catch illegals, even vans packed with illegals, the INS orders the police not to arrest them and to let them go.
[01:51:29.256 --> 01:51:29.636]  That's right.
[01:51:29.676 --> 01:51:35.297]  Now, if you were an American citizen driving without a license, you would be cited, right?
[01:51:36.098 --> 01:51:38.638]  And you would be given an order to appear.
[01:51:38.658 --> 01:51:40.359]  And if you didn't appear, they'd come and arrest you.
[01:51:40.639 --> 01:51:41.759]  These people, they just let go.
[01:51:42.797 --> 01:51:45.919]  I mean, this is a super citizenship.
[01:51:46.339 --> 01:51:50.721]  That means they have all the rights you do, but no obligations, no responsibilities.
[01:51:51.142 --> 01:51:52.022]  This is wonderful.
[01:51:54.043 --> 01:52:00.226]  Well, the new matricula, they find guys with six different matriculas in their pocket, three different ones, 12 different ones in one case.
[01:52:00.246 --> 01:52:01.667]  They'll just issue them to anybody.
[01:52:01.707 --> 01:52:03.628]  Now all these foreign countries are saying they'll do it.
[01:52:03.648 --> 01:52:06.129]  800 cities are saying they're going along with it.
[01:52:07.770 --> 01:52:08.331]  Oh, this is great.
[01:52:09.932 --> 01:52:11.872]  You know, you don't need a driver's license anymore.
[01:52:11.892 --> 01:52:14.413]  You get into an accident, you know what we're going to start doing?
[01:52:14.693 --> 01:52:20.895]  We're going to start printing up matricular consular cards for anybody who wants to log on to our website.
[01:52:21.535 --> 01:52:22.555]  You might want to do it too.
[01:52:22.575 --> 01:52:25.976]  Just charge them $15 and you print it up and send it to them.
[01:52:25.996 --> 01:52:28.376]  And then when they get stopped by the cops, just hand it to them.
[01:52:29.577 --> 01:52:33.538]  You know, say I'm from Belize.
[01:52:33.578 --> 01:52:34.918]  Here's my consular card.
[01:52:35.438 --> 01:52:36.698]  What do you mean you're not going to take it?
[01:52:36.738 --> 01:52:39.359]  You're discriminating against me just because I speak English?
[01:52:41.010 --> 01:52:42.311]  Yeah, I think that's the answer.
[01:52:42.351 --> 01:52:44.011]  Glenn, can you stay with us a little bit longer?
[01:52:44.031 --> 01:52:44.552]  Sure.
[01:52:45.052 --> 01:52:50.594]  All right, I want to take some calls from Ron and Spencer and others that are holding and maybe play some of these clips that Glenn's got.
[01:52:50.614 --> 01:52:51.255]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:54.036 --> 01:52:55.057]  Attention, inventors.
[01:52:55.297 --> 01:52:56.057]  Need a patent?
[01:52:56.197 --> 01:52:59.258]  Then you need InvenTech, the launchpad for new ideas.
[01:52:59.499 --> 01:53:02.260]  InvenTech understands the needs of inventors like you.
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.541]  And only InvenTech offers a free...
