[00:00:05.598 --> 00:00:06.238]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:07.939]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:09.780]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.240]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:13.922]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:17.243]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:21.885]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:31.349]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:36.758]  Great people listening all over the globe.
[00:00:36.818 --> 00:00:39.722]  The ships at sea, the troops in foreign lands.
[00:00:40.963 --> 00:00:45.188]  From Rhode Island to Los Angeles on the AM and FM dial.
[00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:49.393]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:54.778]  It is Tuesday, the 9th of December, 2003.
[00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:08.147]  The websites are Infowars.com, being updated right now, and PrisonPlanet.com, already updated for you, to be updated multiple times daily, thanks to the great work of Paul Watson.
[00:01:08.707 --> 00:01:23.936]  Who's been turning up the heat there at PrisonPlanet.com, adding new sections every day of vital information, video, audio, documents, news conferences, assassination information, you name it.
[00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:27.658]  PrisonPlanet.com, spread the word.
[00:01:29.087 --> 00:01:30.008]  We're good to go.
[00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:30.748]  We're good to go.
[00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:14.236]  Days after the blackout of this summer, all over the east into Canada, down to the Carolinas, turns out that they were doing chemtrail spraying, some type of government drill, that much is admitted with magnetic pulse weapons.
[00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:26.533]  In the meantime, there is so much news, so much information today that we're going to cover, and I'm going to cover all of it.
[00:02:27.474 --> 00:02:31.637]  If SARS hits U.S., quarantine could too.
[00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:32.578]  The New York Times.
[00:02:32.638 --> 00:02:36.080]  Any excuse to get martial law rolling in our lives?
[00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:40.004]  Barracks blast injures 41 U.S.
[00:02:40.124 --> 00:02:40.584]  troops.
[00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:45.508]  Five killed in suicide attack in Russia.
[00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.291]  Taiwan warned by U.S.
[00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:59.980]  not to vote for independence in violation of her own treaty with them, and they're going to have the big Chi-Com leader over here with the big salute and the toasting their tyranny.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.063]  These people have killed more than Hitler, but our government loves them.
[00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:10.528]  China's win to get 19-gun salute, spectacular pump from the White House.
[00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:15.036]  U.S., again, cautions Taiwan on independence, tells them to back off.
[00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:21.020]  Missiles outfitted with dirty bomb warheads, apparently missing, expert says, from the AP.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.485]  Voting machine makers are trying to fight back as the evidence comes out of, well, how they're stealing our right to vote.
[00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:32.528]  President Bush is less conservative than Clinton, Orange County registered.
[00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.951]  And this was by a well-known conservative commentator.
[00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:40.594]  In fact, I have three editorials by well-known conservatives saying Bush is out-Clintoning Clinton.
[00:03:41.403 --> 00:03:45.146]  Oh, you figured it out three-plus years into his reign.
[00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:55.653]  I mean, I wish for Al Gore or Bill Clinton or Hillary, because these monsters couldn't get their agenda through, because conservatives would be wary of them.
[00:03:56.474 --> 00:04:00.036]  But that's not the case with Hare Bush.
[00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:01.437]  So that's coming up, too.
[00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:03.658]  Great article by Chuck Baldwin, as well.
[00:04:03.718 --> 00:04:07.181]  Without alliance and allegiance to the Constitution, party...
[00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:11.110]  Partnership means absolutely nothing.
[00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.613]  USDA creating national livestock ID system.
[00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:20.516]  Two-thirds of Israelis back creation of Palestinian state, poll shows.
[00:04:20.836 --> 00:04:27.301]  CDC vaccine study slammed as a cover-up of autism and what the injections are doing.
[00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:31.003]  Teen generation will be the world's sickest adults.
[00:04:31.183 --> 00:04:34.806]  London Telegraph, UN warns on population surge.
[00:04:36.147 --> 00:04:37.908]  And more on the world ID card.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.041]  That's just some of what's coming up in this first hour.
[00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.442]  Believe me, we haven't scratched the surface.
[00:04:44.842 --> 00:04:46.283]  You will want to stay with us.
[00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:49.704]  The total free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:49.724 --> 00:04:51.764]  And the website's infowards.com.
[00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:05.386]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:09.972]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.132 --> 00:05:14.498]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.558 --> 00:05:15.899]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.672]  Can't emerge.
[00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:21.897]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.977 --> 00:05:28.907]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.047 --> 00:05:31.069]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.494]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[00:05:34.654 --> 00:05:41.741]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:47.406]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:05:47.906 --> 00:05:50.528]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:51.830]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.971]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:11.414]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:11.594 --> 00:06:19.184]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.384 --> 00:06:20.165]  We're good to go.
[00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:39.266]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:39.306 --> 00:06:41.187]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:41.388 --> 00:06:47.313]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:51.517]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.537 --> 00:06:52.117]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:52.137 --> 00:06:52.237]  Oh my...
[00:07:01.745 --> 00:07:06.448]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:07:06.608 --> 00:07:07.228]  Yes, it's true.
[00:07:07.248 --> 00:07:09.990]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.112]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills and Viagra.
[00:07:14.192 --> 00:07:14.772]  You heard it right.
[00:07:14.932 --> 00:07:19.874]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief and heartburn relief.
[00:07:19.994 --> 00:07:21.015]  The list goes on and on.
[00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:22.216]  You may miss out forever.
[00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.469]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:03.982]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.562 --> 00:08:07.582]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.906 --> 00:08:24.787]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:24.847 --> 00:08:25.987]  It is Tuesday, the 9th of December, 2003.
[00:08:26.027 --> 00:08:26.447]  As we chronicle the...
[00:08:31.357 --> 00:08:52.664]  Dark days as the global empire expands, as freedom and liberty is destroyed, as electronic prison control grids are erected around us, and as the next phase, a massive offensive triggered by government-sponsored terror, looms on the horizon.
[00:08:54.261 --> 00:09:12.926]  We are here in the trenches, transmitting globally, splattering our message out in information warfare via the AM and FM dial, a huge internet listenership, as well as global shortwave, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central at 12.172 and 93.20, and at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:30.270]  About to launch straight into all the latest bombings and police state activities and disgusting communists coming here to be toasted by George W. Bush and his Clintonista clones.
[00:09:32.231 --> 00:09:42.215]  But before I launch into the news, I do want to encourage every listener who can make it to come to Houston, Texas this Saturday from 6 p.m.
[00:09:42.255 --> 00:09:42.936]  to midnight.
[00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.377]  I will give a 30-minute speech.
[00:09:46.132 --> 00:09:49.614]  We will then show 9-11, The Road to Tyranny on the big screen.
[00:09:50.955 --> 00:10:07.165]  Then we will have a question and answer, an intermission, and we will show John Carpenter's They Live, which is an amazing film to get people's minds outside the box and to see the bigger picture.
[00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:12.768]  So that's this Saturday at the Alamo Drafthouse Luxury Movie Theater.
[00:10:12.788 --> 00:10:14.029]  I mean, it's so nice, folks.
[00:10:14.369 --> 00:10:15.670]  Nicest theater I've ever been in.
[00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:17.612]  We're good to go.
[00:10:17.632 --> 00:10:17.872]  I think?
[00:10:47.924 --> 00:10:53.529]  Now, I don't think that'll happen on the second go-around, and they didn't sell out until 7 p.m.
[00:10:54.750 --> 00:11:02.796]  200 people just showed up right when it was about to start, thinking that they could get in, and to my dismay, 200 got turned away.
[00:11:03.516 --> 00:11:13.544]  I suggest you go to InfoWars.com and link through on the website and buy your tickets now, or get there at about 5.30 next Saturday.
[00:11:13.605 --> 00:11:14.866]  Don't get there at 6 o'clock.
[00:11:16.198 --> 00:11:17.079]  We're good to go.
[00:11:17.099 --> 00:11:17.279]  I think?
[00:11:42.262 --> 00:11:47.224]  And, of course, Mel Gibson's dad and a lot of his family and Mel Gibson's sisters and people showed up.
[00:11:47.605 --> 00:11:48.465]  That was a lot of fun.
[00:11:48.505 --> 00:11:51.046]  I didn't want to say they were going to be there, even though they told me they were going to be there.
[00:11:51.887 --> 00:11:53.187]  I don't know if they'll be there this time.
[00:11:53.247 --> 00:11:59.050]  But really exciting, a lot of fun, great place to meet like-minded people.
[00:12:00.271 --> 00:12:01.831]  It was amazing.
[00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:05.213]  It was a lot of fun and a lot of great information.
[00:12:05.911 --> 00:12:09.136]  And they've got pizza and hamburgers and all that stuff there.
[00:12:09.157 --> 00:12:12.061]  I mean, it's a luxury movie theater.
[00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:14.485]  It's the nicest of the four Alamo Drafthouse theaters.
[00:12:14.745 --> 00:12:16.047]  They've got three of them here in Austin.
[00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.490]  And again...
[00:12:18.954 --> 00:12:25.041]  I know most of you in the country can't come to this event, but it is interesting just to talk about the success of the past events.
[00:12:25.101 --> 00:12:26.923]  We've shown Road to Tyranny twice in Austin.
[00:12:26.963 --> 00:12:31.227]  It sold out here both times, though we didn't turn away hundreds of people.
[00:12:31.567 --> 00:12:40.397]  So get your tickets now at InfoWars.com, or just show up 30 minutes an hour early, buy your tickets, then go to Dillard's or Nordstrom's or...
[00:12:40.977 --> 00:12:42.037]  Go shopping.
[00:12:42.097 --> 00:12:46.559]  You can show up at 4 o'clock on Saturday, get your tickets, and then go shopping for a couple hours.
[00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:49.159]  It's in a big, nice shopping mall.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.620]  It's just such a nice theater.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.960]  You'll be amazed by it.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.161]  You have your own table in front of you.
[00:12:56.981 --> 00:13:00.822]  It's nice, folks, and a great place to meet and network and get involved.
[00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:10.145]  So I hope to see you in Houston, Texas this Saturday from 6 to midnight for a double feature, a police state expose double feature.
[00:13:10.862 --> 00:13:13.203]  All right, let me get straight into the news.
[00:13:13.723 --> 00:13:26.245]  I also want to take some time out to thank Stephanie and George, who are both running the show today, while Mark Carl is on a well-deserved two-week vacation.
[00:13:27.226 --> 00:13:34.187]  I want to thank the network and Ted Anderson and Michael Trudeau for never censoring me and allowing me to have this First Amendment venue.
[00:13:34.287 --> 00:13:38.628]  I want to thank from the bottom of my heart all of our AM and FM affiliates.
[00:13:39.897 --> 00:13:41.938]  I want to thank our sponsors.
[00:13:42.058 --> 00:13:44.559]  I want to thank, number one, our listeners.
[00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:55.644]  And I want to thank, well, I should say, number one, God, Jesus Christ, for the opportunity and for moving station owners and managers' hearts and minds to put this show on the air.
[00:13:55.984 --> 00:13:58.205]  The show is growing by leaps and bounds.
[00:13:58.265 --> 00:14:04.267]  We are reaching, conservatively, 2 million people a week.
[00:14:04.287 --> 00:14:06.068]  2 million people a week.
[00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:14.758]  And I know for a fact that a lot of prominent politicians listen to the show, have seen the films, thanks to you.
[00:14:14.778 --> 00:14:26.224]  I know for a fact that many prominent Hollywood people are being deprogrammed by this show and are listening right now via the internet and, well, now on the local AM that covers LA.
[00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:28.395]  I think we're good to go.
[00:14:55.522 --> 00:15:03.447]  And, you know, last night I was on KOA out of Denver, 850, for three hours.
[00:15:04.548 --> 00:15:11.012]  And so I went to sleep at about 515 this morning because I couldn't go to sleep for about an hour after I got off the air.
[00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:19.797]  I was on from 1 o'clock in the morning, I guess midnight out there, until 4 in the morning there, 5 in the morning here.
[00:15:20.137 --> 00:15:20.377]  And I...
[00:15:23.345 --> 00:15:24.625]  Got about three hours sleep.
[00:15:24.665 --> 00:15:30.467]  I'm not complaining, but that's the type of dedication that it's going to take to get this country back.
[00:15:30.647 --> 00:15:39.229]  And if you want to interview me on your local AM or FM station, anytime, anyplace, unless I'm live on my own show, I will be there.
[00:15:39.869 --> 00:15:41.749]  Because I will not turn down an opportunity.
[00:15:41.849 --> 00:15:44.010]  I talk to people in grocery store lines.
[00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.970]  I talk to people at the shopping mall.
[00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.951]  I talk to people on the street.
[00:15:48.962 --> 00:15:51.126]  I talk to people everywhere I go.
[00:15:51.226 --> 00:15:56.916]  I roll down my window and tell them to tune in to the local AM affiliate here in Austin.
[00:15:57.817 --> 00:15:59.058]  I'm taking action.
[00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.580]  I know we're under attack.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.320]  I know.
[00:16:01.701 --> 00:16:03.322]  I've put on the sunglasses.
[00:16:03.382 --> 00:16:08.246]  Again, the analogy of in They Live, you put the sunglasses on, you can see the real world.
[00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:13.111]  And once you've seen the real world, it's impossible to go back.
[00:16:13.531 --> 00:16:19.817]  You either have to fight the globalists, or if you're a sociopath, evil, wicked demon, I guess you join them out of cowardice.
[00:16:21.483 --> 00:16:25.109]  All right, let's launch straight into the news that I mentioned in the first segment.
[00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:28.033]  If SARS hits U.S., quarantine could too.
[00:16:32.071 --> 00:16:36.516]  This is the Model State's Health Emergency Powers Act, the Force Inoculation Program.
[00:16:36.556 --> 00:16:47.168]  The CFR was saying they were going to use smallpox for sure to hit Dallas, Cleveland, and Denver, according to CFR head fairmonger Gary Hart of the Hart-Rubin Commission.
[00:16:47.188 --> 00:16:48.490]  You've probably seen him on television.
[00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.855]  He said we would be hit last year, but 99-plus percent of...
[00:16:53.470 --> 00:17:05.680]  Police, firefighters, and medical workers refused to take it, so now they've had to move on to SARS, which has been looked at very closely, is genetically engineered, has been altered by humans.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:11.766]  Again, I've got voluminous, prestigious medical reports on that, and now they're trying to fearmonger with that weapon.
[00:17:12.186 --> 00:17:21.614]  I will remind you that West Nile was given to Saddam in 1984 by Donald Rumsfeld and the Commerce Department, so we have that as well.
[00:17:22.398 --> 00:17:23.958]  And this is how they're going to get their control.
[00:17:24.198 --> 00:17:31.080]  Oh, we're just giving you martial law for your safety, General Eberhardt at NORTHCOM Command in Colorado Springs has said.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.001]  The former CENTCOM head, Tommy Franks, has said.
[00:17:34.861 --> 00:17:46.363]  As the health officer of Alameda County, Dr. Anthony Iton is prepared to make tough choices if SARS reemerges this winter or spring, as many infectious disease experts fear.
[00:17:47.524 --> 00:17:49.704]  Now, again, it kills about one out of 100 that get it.
[00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.011]  The flu kills 35,000.
[00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.332]  But see, you're used to it.
[00:17:53.553 --> 00:17:54.593]  You're not scared of it.
[00:17:54.633 --> 00:17:55.674]  It's not the unknown.
[00:17:56.215 --> 00:17:57.616]  So they have to fearmonger with this.
[00:17:57.676 --> 00:18:16.371]  By the way, the federal government two years ago dug up frozen bodies near the North Pole of dead explorers and whalers, dug out the super influenza that killed 40 million people about 85 years ago, and they are saying that they are developing it as a weapon.
[00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:17.692]  So watch that pop up, too.
[00:18:19.085 --> 00:18:35.575]  The county just across the bay from here has identified two large buildings where if voluntary steps to quell an epidemic were to fail, the authorities could sequester not just people who are sick, but also people who might have been exposed to the SARS virus, Dr. Iton said.
[00:18:36.256 --> 00:18:42.620]  And during the hysteria, they can arrest patriots and Christians and pastors, and that's the public COINTELPRO plan.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.903]  Any public official, left, right, anybody who's not controlled by the globalists
[00:18:49.056 --> 00:19:08.041]  And in 99, they turned an old 747 hangar at the old Robert Mueller Airport here in Austin, put bolts and chains in the floors, dozens and dozens and dozens of porta-potties, thousands of cots, barbed wire inside giant containment cages, and they built these all over the country.
[00:19:08.081 --> 00:19:12.162]  Here is the New York Times admitting this for you today.
[00:19:14.794 --> 00:19:17.055]  On Infowars.com right now.
[00:19:17.616 --> 00:19:18.256]  Read that again.
[00:19:18.796 --> 00:19:24.399]  The authorities could sequester not just people who were sick, but also people who might have been exposed to the SARS virus.
[00:19:24.779 --> 00:19:27.801]  Dr. Iton said, they will chain you down.
[00:19:28.401 --> 00:19:30.622]  The buildings, he said, could house up to 100 people.
[00:19:31.083 --> 00:19:32.483]  The one in Austin will house 1,000.
[00:19:33.044 --> 00:19:35.685]  And could be guarded to keep anyone from
[00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:49.502]  It's a virtual certainty that sometimes in the near future we will see SARS-like event in the United States, a highly communicable infectious disease that will require mass quarantine or isolation, Dr. Itens said.
[00:19:50.944 --> 00:19:57.851]  We'll talk more about this and other key news, but this is their blueprint, their smokescreen for martial law.
[00:19:58.231 --> 00:19:59.493]  Brace yourselves for it.
[00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:08.605]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:20:08.825 --> 00:20:11.087]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:20:11.288 --> 00:20:17.634]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver, 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:20:17.984 --> 00:20:18.624]  We're good to go.
[00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:43.815]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:20:43.835 --> 00:20:47.877]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds, and the like.
[00:21:10.558 --> 00:21:11.138]  We're good to go.
[00:21:30.216 --> 00:21:30.836]  We're good to go.
[00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:31.197]  We're good to go.
[00:21:59.893 --> 00:22:00.293]  I think?
[00:22:29.452 --> 00:22:29.953]  We're good to go.
[00:22:59.192 --> 00:23:00.653]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:23:00.673 --> 00:23:00.793]  Toxics.
[00:23:26.929 --> 00:23:27.690]  We're good to go.
[00:24:06.003 --> 00:24:07.926]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.406 --> 00:24:11.151]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:19.349 --> 00:24:21.931]  Alright, coming up in the next segment, we'll take your calls.
[00:24:21.971 --> 00:24:25.653]  Toll free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:35.440]  And it says, the plan, again, this is to put you in concentration camps, to keep you safe from SARS.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:41.464]  However, also calls for health authorities to cooperate closely with law enforcement and to consider, in extreme cases...
[00:24:42.333 --> 00:24:48.240]  Electronic forms of monitoring, detention facilities, and establishment of heavy guarded quarantine zones.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.245]  It also calls for respecting civil liberties and keeping the public informed.
[00:24:53.166 --> 00:24:57.571]  Again, that's like saying I'm going to shoot you in the head and take care of your personal health.
[00:24:58.177 --> 00:25:11.347]  Patrick Libby, Executive Director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, that's the guy that gives everybody marching orders, said the health authorities in many jurisdictions have been identifying possible buildings and preparing for possible outbreaks.
[00:25:11.507 --> 00:25:13.729]  Oh, long before 9-11 you had.
[00:25:14.449 --> 00:25:18.892]  Yes, but now you have to announce it to us because now it's getting time to use.
[00:25:19.433 --> 00:25:22.895]  People are taking the questions absolutely seriously, Mr. Libby said.
[00:25:22.915 --> 00:25:27.619]  With the SARS outbreak, it really sharpened the focus on the nuts and bolts planning.
[00:25:29.105 --> 00:25:38.847]  Some issues facing health officials, Mr. Libby added, concern legal processes for imposing quarantines, ways to house people and manage their needs, and the financing of such undertakings.
[00:25:40.908 --> 00:25:41.488]  Isn't that nice?
[00:25:41.528 --> 00:25:45.509]  And so they're going to have to put you in these rest and relocation centers.
[00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:46.629]  That's what the British called them.
[00:25:46.649 --> 00:25:52.451]  And, of course, it was the British government that released foot and mouth and used that to get the farmers and ranchers off their property.
[00:25:53.223 --> 00:25:55.125]  Well, I guess they just call them farmers over there.
[00:25:55.646 --> 00:25:57.387]  So you can comment on that if you'd like to.
[00:25:57.407 --> 00:25:58.469]  We'll get into more of it later.
[00:25:58.929 --> 00:26:01.372]  Barracks blast injures 41 U.S.
[00:26:01.472 --> 00:26:01.852]  troops.
[00:26:02.293 --> 00:26:02.533]  41 U.S.
[00:26:02.553 --> 00:26:09.560]  troops were wounded in a suicide car bombing outside their barracks near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul today.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:15.867]  In a separate incident, three Iraqis were killed in a rocket attack on the Sunni mosque in Iraq's capital, Baghdad.
[00:26:16.307 --> 00:26:16.888]  We're good to go.
[00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:17.468]  We're good to go.
[00:26:31.425 --> 00:26:40.709]  Guards opened fire on the vehicle after the driver ignored orders to halt as it approached the base of the 101st Airborne Division 3rd Brigade early this morning.
[00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:44.111]  Also, five killed in suicide attack in Russia.
[00:26:44.131 --> 00:26:52.215]  A female suicide bomber detonated explosives in a car near Moscow's Red Square on Tuesday, killing five people and injuring 13.
[00:26:52.255 --> 00:26:57.457]  The IHR Tops news agency reported the blast took place on the capital's main shopping street.
[00:26:58.189 --> 00:26:58.569]  We're good to go.
[00:26:58.589 --> 00:26:59.110]  We're good to go.
[00:27:17.126 --> 00:27:22.189]  We've caught Putin blowing up buildings and bombing stuff and then no body of the suicide bombers found.
[00:27:22.409 --> 00:27:25.610]  There are real terrorists, but the majority of the time it's government.
[00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:27.851]  Putin uses it as a police state crackdown.
[00:27:28.371 --> 00:27:30.612]  Oh, we ought to be proud of ourselves here in the U.S.
[00:27:30.632 --> 00:27:31.993]  Talk about Al Clinton and Clinton.
[00:27:32.353 --> 00:27:35.895]  How many talk show hosts, how many writers like Mr. Gertz?
[00:27:36.542 --> 00:27:46.765]  Criticized Clinton, and rightfully so, for supercomputers, missile parts to China, toasting the leaders of this despotic state in the White House.
[00:27:46.925 --> 00:27:49.206]  Well, it gets worse under Hare Bush.
[00:27:49.666 --> 00:27:52.086]  Clinton would never chastise Taiwan.
[00:27:53.307 --> 00:27:55.067]  Taiwan warned by U.S.
[00:27:55.267 --> 00:28:01.589]  island ass not to provoke China on the eve of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabo's visit.
[00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:14.581]  The Bush administration signaled a tougher stance on Taiwan's moves towards independence yesterday, warning the island not to take any unilateral steps that might provoke the government of the Chinese mainland.
[00:28:15.515 --> 00:28:22.361]  Now, the rightful government of China that our government sold out in 49, that's now admitted is in Taiwan, and now it's just publicly being sold out.
[00:28:22.901 --> 00:28:34.831]  A senior administration official briefing reporters in advance of Wynne's meeting with President Bush today said the administration had decided to drop a policy known as strategic ambiguity, declining to say how it would respond to Everett's
[00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:35.471]  I think?
[00:29:04.893 --> 00:29:17.669]  As part of the diplomatic code, the official said coercion or use of force by China is unacceptable, but the bulk of the official's remarks concern Taiwan, including a sharp rejection of a referendum scheduled this spring that U.S.
[00:29:17.709 --> 00:29:21.234]  officials believe is designed to inspire Taiwan's independence movement.
[00:29:22.242 --> 00:29:40.533]  I will tell you that we are giving the Taiwanese the message very clearly and very authoritatively that we do not want to see steps towards independence and we don't want to see moves taken, proposals made that a logical outsider would conclude are really geared primarily towards moving the island in that direction, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
[00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:46.816]  So, telling people not to be independent from murderers that have killed more than Hitler.
[00:29:47.417 --> 00:29:49.598]  That's the new America, the new conservatism.
[00:29:51.374 --> 00:29:52.277]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.779 --> 00:29:54.384]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.327 --> 00:29:58.015]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:05.350]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:06.011]  Yes.
[00:30:06.291 --> 00:30:11.093]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[00:30:11.213 --> 00:30:20.136]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[00:30:20.276 --> 00:30:27.999]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[00:30:28.199 --> 00:30:30.400]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.522]  Go to AustinWheatgrass.com or call toll-free 1-877-MY-WHEAT.

[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:28.302]  With the stock market on the skids, and really nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[00:31:28.702 --> 00:31:32.463]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[00:31:56.633 --> 00:32:03.456]  Hey, everybody, let me talk to you about your weight for a minute.
[00:32:03.516 --> 00:32:06.098]  How many of you have tried the fad diets?
[00:32:06.298 --> 00:32:07.439]  You've tried the pills.
[00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:08.899]  You've tried counting calories.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.601]  You've even tried other nighttime weight loss formulas.
[00:32:11.906 --> 00:32:12.426]  We're good to go.
[00:32:29.901 --> 00:32:31.482]  No ephedra, no stimulants.
[00:32:31.542 --> 00:32:37.383]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:32:37.443 --> 00:32:38.724]  This is the real deal, folks.
[00:32:38.784 --> 00:32:41.385]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[00:32:41.505 --> 00:32:42.545]  And it's healthy for you, too.
[00:32:42.685 --> 00:32:49.307]  In addition to helping you lose weight, Collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair, and nails.
[00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.448]  So take Collagenate and rejuvenate.
[00:32:51.508 --> 00:32:52.528]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:32:52.548 --> 00:32:52.748]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:32:52.768 --> 00:32:52.968]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:33:03.999 --> 00:33:10.041]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.641 --> 00:33:13.662]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.863 --> 00:33:20.144]  Folks, I want to see you, if you live in Texas especially.
[00:33:21.025 --> 00:33:22.686]  No excuse if you live in South Texas.
[00:33:23.327 --> 00:33:25.809]  In Houston, this Saturday, 6 p.m.
[00:33:25.849 --> 00:33:30.913]  to midnight, I'm going to show 9-11 Road to Tyranny and then John Carpenter's They Live.
[00:33:31.333 --> 00:33:36.738]  I'm going to speak for 30 minutes at 6 p.m., show Road to Tyranny, then take question and answers after Road to Tyranny.
[00:33:37.518 --> 00:33:40.801]  Then we're going to show John Carpenter's They Live.
[00:33:41.633 --> 00:33:47.097]  And that's at the Alamo Draft House, the West Oak Shopping Center, obviously in West Houston.
[00:33:47.478 --> 00:33:48.939]  You can order tickets online.
[00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:54.083]  Link through to the Alamo Draft House website at infowars.com.
[00:33:54.784 --> 00:33:55.544]  Hope to see you.
[00:33:55.644 --> 00:33:56.645]  Great place to network.
[00:33:56.665 --> 00:33:59.948]  A lot of wonderful people to meet in Houston this weekend.
[00:33:59.988 --> 00:34:01.329]  Please bring your friends and family.
[00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:02.790]  It'll be a great event.
[00:34:03.671 --> 00:34:08.975]  By the way, before I go to Charles and Ron and Jay and David and Jess and others...
[00:34:09.796 --> 00:34:11.337]  Always nice to hear from the ladies.
[00:34:11.397 --> 00:34:14.719]  Some days we have mostly female callers, but most days it's men.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:21.384]  The toll-free number to join us on air on any of these news items I've been covering, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:23.145 --> 00:34:28.569]  Coming up, more on how they're building concentration camps for you during a so-called SARS outbreak.
[00:34:29.369 --> 00:34:29.629]  I think.
[00:34:53.132 --> 00:34:59.280]  To get a 19-gun salute spectacular pomp from the White House, something Bill Clinton didn't even do.
[00:35:00.477 --> 00:35:02.979]  So, again, you're a communist if you're against the communists now.
[00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:04.200]  You're not a good neocon.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:04.940]  U.S.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.102]  cautions Taiwan independence threatens them.
[00:35:07.862 --> 00:35:11.865]  Missiles outfitted with dirty bomb warheads apparently missing, experts says.
[00:35:12.185 --> 00:35:16.428]  Voting machine makers on the defensive as their fraud is exposed.
[00:35:16.748 --> 00:35:19.089]  President Bush is less conservative than Clinton.
[00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:22.832]  This out of the Orange County Register by a well-known conservative writer.
[00:35:24.207 --> 00:35:28.430]  Without allegiance to the Constitution, partnership means absolutely nothing.
[00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.772]  This is by Chuck Ball, another great article.
[00:35:31.832 --> 00:35:34.434]  USDA creating national livestock ID system.
[00:35:34.834 --> 00:35:38.657]  Two-thirds of Israelis back creation of Palestinian state.
[00:35:38.797 --> 00:35:39.978]  That's a shocker poll.
[00:35:40.939 --> 00:35:44.161]  CDC vaccine study slammed as a cover-up.
[00:35:44.661 --> 00:35:47.203]  Teen generation will be world's sickest.
[00:35:48.395 --> 00:35:50.897]  UN warns of population surge.
[00:35:51.218 --> 00:35:59.284]  Another article on the World ID card system being unfurled, being unveiled, being brought out in plain view.
[00:35:59.685 --> 00:36:01.866]  Cannibal murderer shown to court.
[00:36:01.946 --> 00:36:03.187]  The idiot videotaped it.
[00:36:03.207 --> 00:36:03.768]  The sicko did.
[00:36:04.368 --> 00:36:05.510]  Israel trains U.S.
[00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:07.411]  assassination squads in Iraq.
[00:36:07.471 --> 00:36:10.915]  London Guardian, also out of the Australian, Israel aiding U.S.
[00:36:11.015 --> 00:36:11.515]  in Iraq.
[00:36:11.535 --> 00:36:13.277]  We reported this months ago, but here it is.
[00:36:13.617 --> 00:36:14.839]  That's only going to inflame things.
[00:36:15.279 --> 00:36:16.941]  Big story out of the Sunday Herald here.
[00:36:16.981 --> 00:36:18.642]  It's been covered by the Boston Globe for years.
[00:36:18.963 --> 00:36:22.726]  The FBI used this guy to frame men for murders.
[00:36:22.766 --> 00:36:25.349]  They did not commit to keep the real killers free.
[00:36:25.909 --> 00:36:27.271]  And the cover-up goes on.
[00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:30.950]  Folks, that's just some of what's coming up.
[00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:37.374]  Before we go right to your calls and then to more of this key news, I have made ten documentary films.
[00:36:38.654 --> 00:36:50.681]  The newest is The Matrix of Evil Exposed, and it's Congressman Ron Paul on world government, Colonel Craig Roberts on the New World Order and the police state, Frank Morales covering posse commentatus and the drug war.
[00:36:52.011 --> 00:36:55.733]  Cynthia McKinney on UN-run white slavery rings in 9-11.
[00:36:56.553 --> 00:36:58.574]  Excerpts of free speeches I've given.
[00:36:58.594 --> 00:37:00.055]  It's a different type of film.
[00:37:00.075 --> 00:37:02.356]  My other films aren't speeches and interviews.
[00:37:04.576 --> 00:37:06.137]  They're mainly done in documentary format.
[00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:09.779]  This is a different type of film, and people are giving me rave reviews of it.
[00:37:09.799 --> 00:37:11.319]  It's a little over two hours long.
[00:37:11.339 --> 00:37:11.979]  $25.95 a film.
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:29.551]  If you get three or more of any of the ten titles, whether it's 9-11, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State, Three Total, Enslavement, Dark Secrets Inside, Bohemian Grove, America Destroyed by Design, they drop down to $20 apiece, they make great gifts, and they're waking up roughly 80% to 90% of those that see the films.
[00:37:34.381 --> 00:37:38.224]  Because lately I've been hearing from a few people that say folks aren't waking up.
[00:37:38.365 --> 00:37:41.687]  All of them aren't waking up, so I think that number's down to about 80% right now.
[00:37:42.308 --> 00:37:44.190]  I actually kind of keep a mental average of it.
[00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:51.276]  But the vast majority are waking up that see the films, whereas just a few years ago about half of those that saw the films were waking up.
[00:37:51.716 --> 00:37:52.377]  We're good to go.

[00:38:42.006 --> 00:38:42.666]  Don't wait.

[00:38:47.368 --> 00:38:48.188]  Pay it forward.

[00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:52.350]  It's one of the best and easiest tools we've got.
[00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:53.991]  So what excuse do you have?
[00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:55.431]  And it supports this broadcast.

[00:38:56.112 --> 00:38:58.853]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:39:10.337 --> 00:39:12.358]  Let's talk to Charles in Louisiana.
[00:39:12.398 --> 00:39:12.858]  Charles?
[00:39:12.878 --> 00:39:16.019]  Okay.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.360]  I believe he's got his radio cranked way up.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:26.122]  We'll ask Charles to turn that off, and we'll go back to him.
[00:39:27.283 --> 00:39:28.363]  Yes, Charles, go ahead.
[00:39:29.564 --> 00:39:30.984]  Thank you for what you're doing, Mr. Jones.
[00:39:31.624 --> 00:39:37.906]  I'd just like to say for this Christmas, all the listeners, just wake up one person this Christmas.
[00:39:38.427 --> 00:39:39.707]  We'll double our audiences.
[00:39:40.239 --> 00:39:41.120]  We'll be stronger.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.342]  We'll have a better chance to win this thing.
[00:39:44.003 --> 00:39:46.905]  I really don't feel, Mr. Jones, we've got that much longer.
[00:39:47.826 --> 00:39:49.868]  Well, I just read the New York Times.
[00:39:49.948 --> 00:39:52.491]  Charles, have you seen the takeover?
[00:39:52.511 --> 00:39:52.571]  Yes.
[00:39:54.432 --> 00:39:56.996]  Yeah, and the airport, they've got chains in the floor and all that.
[00:40:12.714 --> 00:40:22.857]  Yeah, the old airport's a huge camp, and now they're openly in the New York Times telling us, oh, it's a new development for our safety, and they're building these in every town.
[00:40:22.977 --> 00:40:26.958]  Well, yesterday probably told the Jewish people to get them in a ghetto.
[00:40:26.978 --> 00:40:39.802]  They told them it was to stop infection and for their security and for their safety, and then there was, of course, the de-lousing that took place when they herded them into the boxcars and then on into the chambers.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:47.965]  But, Mr. Jones, if everybody listening to this, just one person, just one, and everybody could do it, Mr. Jones.
[00:40:48.005 --> 00:40:48.585]  I beg them.
[00:40:48.685 --> 00:40:52.808]  Please, for our country, just wake up somebody in their family, a neighbor.
[00:40:53.168 --> 00:40:53.888]  Just do it.
[00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:55.669]  We'll be twice as strong.
[00:40:55.689 --> 00:40:56.570]  We'll have a better chance.
[00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:58.031]  We don't have that much longer.
[00:40:58.362 --> 00:41:03.083]  And, Mr. Jones, I can't let my wife go to a FINA camp, maybe be raped by some foreign troop.
[00:41:03.143 --> 00:41:05.444]  Well, at that point, you know what you've got to do, bud.
[00:41:05.564 --> 00:41:08.665]  We're trying to avert that, but if they want to pull it, it's going to happen.
[00:41:08.965 --> 00:41:12.846]  And I would advise the police and everybody else to stay home and to not try it.
[00:41:13.366 --> 00:41:16.047]  And, please, I know you get tired of me talking about the tapes.
[00:41:16.067 --> 00:41:16.507]  I know you do.
[00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:22.409]  But if everybody gets a tape and gets somebody for Christmas, we would be twice as strong.
[00:41:22.449 --> 00:41:24.129]  Just one of your tapes, any one of them.
[00:41:24.801 --> 00:41:27.302]  And how many videos have you put out? 4,324.
[00:41:54.432 --> 00:41:56.115]  Wow, that's a lot of copies.
[00:41:56.175 --> 00:41:59.019]  Well, I know this, it's having a huge effect, so keep it up.
[00:41:59.179 --> 00:42:00.741]  Well, here's the thing, it's my life.
[00:42:01.702 --> 00:42:03.525]  People get mad at my wife, gets mad at me.
[00:42:03.625 --> 00:42:04.947]  It's my life putting this out.
[00:42:05.247 --> 00:42:06.910]  This is the only way I got to fight.
[00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:08.472]  You understand, Mr. Jones?
[00:42:09.036 --> 00:42:12.417]  And when I don't do this, I get depressed because this is my calling.
[00:42:12.457 --> 00:42:13.658]  Well, hey, it's the same way.
[00:42:13.678 --> 00:42:16.038]  I mean, there I was up at 5 a.m.
[00:42:16.138 --> 00:42:17.319]  after working yesterday.
[00:42:17.339 --> 00:42:17.779]  I got up at 7.
[00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:19.179]  It's not true.
[00:42:19.199 --> 00:42:26.882]  6.30 yesterday, and I went to sleep at 5 a.m., and I'm energized because that's right, folks.
[00:42:27.302 --> 00:42:29.183]  I'm energized because we don't have a choice.
[00:42:29.623 --> 00:42:38.486]  Now, you talked about waking up your whole parish, police going from threatening to arrest you to asking for more copies and buying you donuts.
[00:42:41.728 --> 00:42:43.828]  Describe that process.
[00:42:44.348 --> 00:42:46.909]  Well, when I first started, I didn't have the tapes.
[00:42:47.369 --> 00:42:50.430]  And I was putting out flags, you know, for Larry Nichols' show.
[00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.410]  And they threatened to arrest me, take my dog and all that.
[00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.251]  So I really got depressed.
[00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:58.331]  So I tuned into your show and I got Police 2000.
[00:42:58.872 --> 00:43:00.412]  And I passed that out.
[00:43:00.492 --> 00:43:01.992]  That didn't have too good of an effect.
[00:43:02.332 --> 00:43:04.993]  But when I started passing out 9-1-1 Road to Terrorism,
[00:43:05.801 --> 00:43:06.541]  We're good to go.
[00:43:26.064 --> 00:43:28.385]  I feel good about myself, and I'm waking them up.
[00:43:28.425 --> 00:43:39.289]  Well, I hate to go on with this, but, folks, this is not hype, and I didn't know you were going to go through all this, Charles, but I thank God these videos are waking up the vast majority of those that see them.
[00:43:39.329 --> 00:43:46.031]  We have a tool, but let me explain why, and then we're going to move on, Charles, because I don't want to spend all day on the tape, but I appreciate your fine comments.
[00:43:47.521 --> 00:43:53.128]  I don't know what the deal is, but folks, everything we put in these is so hardcore.
[00:43:53.388 --> 00:43:55.851]  I mean, take The Takeover, the second Police State video.
[00:43:56.271 --> 00:44:00.817]  Ten minutes of two hours and five minutes is the FEMA camp at the airport.
[00:44:01.337 --> 00:44:03.400]  It's mainstream news articles about the camps.
[00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:15.059]  Of three or four minutes of Road to Tyranny that's two and a half hours long is FEMA in Kansas City saying all Christians are terrorists, all founding fathers are terrorists, they're enemies of the U.S.
[00:44:15.079 --> 00:44:15.440]  government.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.761]  I mean, they say it.
[00:44:16.841 --> 00:44:17.842]  They do it for us.
[00:44:18.183 --> 00:44:21.746]  All I do is take all this stuff they've set up and done and put it together.
[00:44:22.467 --> 00:44:27.312]  And there's not a jury in the world that wouldn't convict them of a criminal conspiracy to overthrow the republic.
[00:44:28.335 --> 00:44:29.235]  Charles, anything else?
[00:44:29.476 --> 00:44:29.976]  Yes.
[00:44:30.076 --> 00:44:34.537]  If everybody would just search their heart and just one tape to share to their family.
[00:44:35.198 --> 00:44:39.359]  We could double our audience by the first of the year.
[00:44:39.579 --> 00:44:40.960]  We'd be twice as strong.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.500]  All they have to do is do it.
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.221]  I don't see what's so hard about them doing it.
[00:44:44.621 --> 00:44:45.001]  I hear you.
[00:44:45.041 --> 00:44:45.742]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:45.822 --> 00:44:46.422]  I appreciate it.
[00:44:46.742 --> 00:44:51.084]  Take about five minutes of the two-hour, five-minute film, Police State 2000.
[00:44:52.264 --> 00:44:54.825]  It's the San Antonio Police Chief, Ale Philippus.
[00:44:56.342 --> 00:44:59.005]  He's now retired, but this was in 99.
[00:44:59.845 --> 00:45:04.469]  Throwing Delta Force out for trying to bribe him and firing machine guns into restaurants.
[00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:07.271]  That's five minutes of a two-hour film.
[00:45:07.792 --> 00:45:10.834]  Black helicopters burning buildings, firing troops running around screaming.
[00:45:12.075 --> 00:45:13.196]  That's 30 minutes of the film.
[00:45:13.997 --> 00:45:15.638]  I mean, I can't describe what's in them.
[00:45:15.658 --> 00:45:16.539]  You've just got to see them.
[00:45:16.619 --> 00:45:19.401]  Okay, I don't want to plug it all day.
[00:45:19.862 --> 00:45:20.763]  Ron in Oklahoma.
[00:45:20.823 --> 00:45:21.503]  Ron, go ahead.
[00:45:21.543 --> 00:45:21.883]  Welcome.
[00:45:23.925 --> 00:45:24.846]  Good to talk to you, Ron.
[00:45:25.672 --> 00:45:26.613]  I appreciate you holding.
[00:45:26.893 --> 00:45:27.693]  Oh, that's fine, Alex.
[00:45:27.773 --> 00:45:29.014]  I'd like to shake Charles' hand.
[00:45:29.054 --> 00:45:30.755]  That guy must be tougher than an old boot.
[00:45:31.636 --> 00:45:34.198]  He really must be.
[00:45:34.538 --> 00:45:35.819]  I've talked to Charles before.
[00:45:35.919 --> 00:45:44.384]  He was tortured in Louisiana with a bag over his head, their favorite tactic in Russia and the U.S., to make him confess and sign a confession.
[00:45:45.145 --> 00:45:46.105]  And I believe him.
[00:45:46.145 --> 00:45:51.669]  I have the FBI here caught red-handed murdering people to keep their drug dealing going.
[00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:54.571]  I heard him talking about that one day.
[00:45:56.411 --> 00:45:58.974]  I think there must be a time lag on your films.
[00:46:02.416 --> 00:46:15.447]  Alex, from the time people see them until they get over the initial shock, and until they finally come around to what's going on, you almost need to issue a disclaimer with these films.
[00:46:16.188 --> 00:46:21.112]  Alex, they're not National Geographic videos by any means, and they shock people so much.
[00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:23.374]  They're certainly not for the faint of heart.
[00:46:24.234 --> 00:46:24.435]  But...
[00:46:25.325 --> 00:46:27.086]  Well, I mean, let me stop you.
[00:46:27.126 --> 00:46:28.927]  Let me stop you so folks get an idea why.
[00:46:29.628 --> 00:46:32.690]  Let's take another two minutes of the takeover.
[00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:47.519]  I walk in the sheriff's department, big, nice sheriff's department in Brooksville, Florida, and I say politely to the public spokeswoman, I say, I would like to talk to the police chief about the special forces training with the police.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.401]  She begins yelling at me.
[00:46:49.461 --> 00:46:52.604]  A woman comes from behind the counter screaming in a Marine Corps shirt.
[00:46:52.965 --> 00:46:54.126]  I want martial law.
[00:46:54.246 --> 00:46:56.808]  Line them up and shoot them.
[00:46:57.149 --> 00:47:01.333]  I mean, folks, everywhere I go, this is the type of stuff we get on tape.
[00:47:01.813 --> 00:47:03.235]  So that's why they're so scary.
[00:47:03.275 --> 00:47:03.735]  Go ahead.
[00:47:04.156 --> 00:47:07.879]  Well, Alex, my first thought is, of course, your 9-11 film.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:09.941]  I'm here in Oklahoma City.
[00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:12.904]  I followed the bombing from, I mean, I felt shocked.
[00:47:13.336 --> 00:47:15.277]  I mean, there's the news saying, here we are, removing the bombs.
[00:47:15.317 --> 00:47:19.741]  Right, and I remember, and I also, I met an Asian kid at an auto supply house,
[00:47:41.889 --> 00:47:53.131]  One night, we got to talking, and he was telling me that his brother was an architectural student at University of Oklahoma, and their class assignment was to design a building that was bomb-proof.
[00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:54.271]  This was after the bombing.
[00:47:54.711 --> 00:48:02.893]  So his brother comes to Oklahoma City, takes pictures of the Murrell building after the bombing, goes back to work on his assignment.
[00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:10.574]  The FBI finds out about it, goes to his parents' house, since his parents are immigrants, shares the daylight side of them,
[00:48:11.195 --> 00:48:19.837]  Then goes to OU to his apartment and finally finds the kid in class, drags him out of class, confiscates his picture, mind you, of the Merle building.
[00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:21.278]  Well, that happens all the time.
[00:48:21.918 --> 00:48:25.199]  And, of course, the kid had already turned the assignment in, so what?
[00:48:25.699 --> 00:48:29.600]  But anyway, they took what they could get, his pictures and negatives.
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:33.621]  So, yeah, I'm really aware of what goes on.
[00:48:34.242 --> 00:48:35.682]  I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[00:48:37.182 --> 00:48:39.243]  I remember following the newspaper account of this.
[00:48:39.867 --> 00:48:52.194]  Retired Air Force General coming to town, and he even testified before the legislature, talked about the bombings, or said that charges had to have been placed on beams in the building to have brought the building down in that manner.
[00:48:52.214 --> 00:48:56.697]  Well, in the film, we have the video of the blackened blast points where they were sheared off.
[00:48:57.257 --> 00:48:58.098]  Right, right.
[00:48:58.198 --> 00:48:59.899]  All that information is in your film.
[00:48:59.939 --> 00:49:01.300]  A lot of people aren't aware of that.
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:05.102]  But these are... I gave...
[00:49:05.975 --> 00:49:12.398]  Some of your films to a World War II vet who saw a lot of combat, Navy vet, in the Pacific during the war.
[00:49:12.438 --> 00:49:19.582]  He even showed me a picture of the carrier that he was on with a hole in the deck from where a kamikaze plane had crashed through the deck.
[00:49:20.342 --> 00:49:23.804]  And after he watched your films, he couldn't sleep at night.
[00:49:23.904 --> 00:49:32.028]  He was so upset because of what he saw and what was going on now in this country after he fought so hard and risked his life during World War II.
[00:49:32.048 --> 00:49:32.088]  So...
[00:49:35.478 --> 00:49:41.803]  These films, there's a lot of information in them, Alex, and they're not ho-hum National Geographic films by any means.
[00:49:41.843 --> 00:49:43.004]  They're not for the faint of heart.
[00:49:43.565 --> 00:49:45.106]  Well, Ron, I appreciate it.
[00:49:45.366 --> 00:49:48.069]  I don't want to... I mean, this happens every once in a while.
[00:49:48.089 --> 00:49:50.991]  It's kind of turning into a discussion of films, which I guess we can do.
[00:49:51.612 --> 00:49:53.253]  But, yeah, they really are a good tool.
[00:49:53.694 --> 00:49:55.875]  But there's one thing I wanted to ask you, Alex.
[00:49:56.336 --> 00:50:02.281]  What is the connection between the CIA, black drug gangs, local law enforcement...
[00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:03.580]  Local government?
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.001]  What goes on there?
[00:50:05.241 --> 00:50:06.161]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[00:50:06.201 --> 00:50:07.122]  I'll answer the question.
[00:50:08.263 --> 00:50:17.769]  What happened is you had a few families that controlled the liquor industry in this country, and they were losing control via competition.
[00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:22.472]  So they lobbied and used the useful idiots who were for prohibition to pass it.
[00:50:23.553 --> 00:50:32.619]  And they knew, because they'd done it 100 years, actually then about 80 years before in China, the British brought down the country by controlling the opium.
[00:50:34.233 --> 00:50:37.195]  And they knew that by making it illegal, that would boost their profits.
[00:50:37.215 --> 00:50:42.917]  They could ship it in from overseas out of Canada, and it could corrupt local officials by the black market.
[00:50:42.958 --> 00:50:44.618]  It would boost prices in their market.
[00:50:45.279 --> 00:50:49.201]  And they started federal checkpoints, expanded the FBI, did all of that during Prohibition.
[00:50:50.121 --> 00:50:52.382]  And it's the same thing with heroin and cocaine.
[00:50:54.143 --> 00:50:57.125]  I'll try to elaborate on that when we get back, and then we'll go quicker to these calls.
[00:50:57.245 --> 00:50:59.746]  Jay, David, Jess, Jim, and others, stay with us.
[00:51:01.585 --> 00:51:07.488]  Oh my... I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:08.249]  Yes, it's true.
[00:51:08.269 --> 00:51:11.030]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:15.132]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:51:15.232 --> 00:51:15.813]  You heard it right.
[00:51:15.953 --> 00:51:20.935]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:51:21.035 --> 00:51:22.056]  The list goes on and on.
[00:51:22.316 --> 00:51:23.256]  You may miss out forever.
[00:51:39.221 --> 00:51:39.862]  We're good to go.
[00:51:39.882 --> 00:51:40.422]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.477 --> 00:52:10.104]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:52:10.324 --> 00:52:21.593]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:52:21.833 --> 00:52:24.475]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:24.816 --> 00:52:28.919]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:52:29.019 --> 00:52:29.579]  We're good to go.
[00:52:54.306 --> 00:52:58.347]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[00:52:58.628 --> 00:52:59.948]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.408 --> 00:53:05.749]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:53:05.929 --> 00:53:10.350]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:14.872]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:53:14.912 --> 00:53:16.252]  The New World Order.
[00:53:17.032 --> 00:53:18.013]  Can emerge.
[00:53:18.053 --> 00:53:22.274]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:53:22.334 --> 00:53:29.277]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:53:29.397 --> 00:53:31.398]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:53:31.812 --> 00:53:42.137]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:53:42.397 --> 00:53:47.760]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Take Three, is for you.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.921]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:53:51.041 --> 00:53:52.062]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:53:52.102 --> 00:53:52.302]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:53:52.342 --> 00:53:53.342]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:54:09.158 --> 00:54:10.840]  All right, we'll go right back to your calls.
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:17.045]  Coming up in about ten minutes, we've got Larry Pratt joining us to talk about the new gun rulings that are horrible.
[00:54:19.027 --> 00:54:22.951]  Just on the whole drug dealing situation, people go, well, they're against drugs.
[00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:26.014]  Yeah, they're for seizing your house, putting you in the private prisons.
[00:54:27.501 --> 00:54:30.424]  By making the illegal drugs illegal, they boost the price.
[00:54:30.544 --> 00:54:31.484]  Then they ship it in.
[00:54:31.524 --> 00:54:35.868]  When they bust a cartel, it's somebody that didn't play ball with the New York Shock Exchange.
[00:54:35.908 --> 00:54:42.093]  I mean, Grasso would go visit the fart gorillas and say, invest your money publicly in the New York Shock Exchange or we'll attack you.
[00:54:42.434 --> 00:54:43.034]  They say no.
[00:54:43.054 --> 00:54:43.795]  They get invaded.
[00:54:43.815 --> 00:54:45.736]  They only spray the communist-controlled areas.
[00:54:46.957 --> 00:54:47.718]  It's a market.
[00:54:48.178 --> 00:54:51.321]  Skull and Bones was founded with opium money.
[00:54:51.761 --> 00:54:53.403]  That's in your encyclopedia, folks.
[00:54:54.331 --> 00:54:55.731]  This is who runs the country.
[00:54:56.391 --> 00:55:06.714]  The Hyde Park Roosevelt dynasty was the big British East India Company family, publicly bringing in about half the lot of liquid opium sold in drugstore counters.
[00:55:06.774 --> 00:55:07.334]  Snake oil.
[00:55:08.134 --> 00:55:10.754]  Yeah, you won't worry about that toothache anymore if you drink a bunch of heroin.
[00:55:12.315 --> 00:55:14.595]  So that's what's going on here.
[00:55:15.355 --> 00:55:18.216]  And notice the bigger the drug war gets, the more drugs we have.
[00:55:18.236 --> 00:55:19.636]  So that's the relationship.
[00:55:19.976 --> 00:55:23.537]  It's a way to corrupt our police, corrupt our FBI, corrupt our society.
[00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:28.452]  And make drugs fashionable when they're a bunch of degenerate trash selling them.
[00:55:28.572 --> 00:55:29.713]  Jay in Colorado.
[00:55:29.753 --> 00:55:30.533]  Jay, you're on the air.
[00:55:30.593 --> 00:55:31.193]  Thanks for holding.
[00:55:31.213 --> 00:55:31.914]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:32.334 --> 00:55:32.734]  Welcome.
[00:55:32.754 --> 00:55:43.099]  I know you don't like to go on too much about the videos, and Jay has been that way with the calls so far, but I've had a problem with the delivery of mine, and it's not been just two weeks or anything like that.
[00:55:43.119 --> 00:55:44.579]  It's been like six weeks.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.100]  I ordered a three-pack.
[00:55:46.604 --> 00:55:46.884]  Yeah.
[00:55:46.904 --> 00:55:52.387]  But the new one, I'm not sure if the new one is holding the delivery of the other two, you know?
[00:55:52.447 --> 00:55:59.611]  No, it's been released, and what you need to do is you need to call, because I'd say about one out of a hundred videos, we get the wrong address or something, and it goes on and on.
[00:55:59.631 --> 00:56:01.532]  You need to call this number right now.
[00:56:01.552 --> 00:56:01.992]  Okay. 512...
[00:56:03.933 --> 00:56:05.114]  512-291-5750.
[00:56:05.134 --> 00:56:09.696]  And we'll ship it out to you.
[00:56:09.816 --> 00:56:17.461]  Is that the office machine and stuff?
[00:56:17.521 --> 00:56:17.921]  Yes.
[00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:21.223]  512-291-5750 for anybody that's had any trouble.
[00:56:21.503 --> 00:56:22.964]  Now, what else is on your mind, sir?
[00:56:23.545 --> 00:56:27.947]  Well, I also got the 9-11 Road to Journey DVD.
[00:56:28.648 --> 00:56:28.848]  Yes.
[00:56:29.148 --> 00:56:31.789]  And I had trouble playing it on DVD players.
[00:56:31.809 --> 00:56:32.430]  It seems to be...
[00:56:33.311 --> 00:56:39.241]  Like jamming up in, I think, part... Whenever Tom Brokaw or whatever his name comes on the screen there, part four?
[00:56:39.541 --> 00:56:43.408]  Well, you need to call us, and we'll send you another one.
[00:56:43.989 --> 00:56:47.775]  I can't get through to anybody, and one number for ordering says they can't.
[00:56:48.587 --> 00:57:00.101]  Well, sir, what happens is if you call 888-253-3139, that's an operator service, and they will give you my office number, and they will call you back today.
[00:57:00.742 --> 00:57:01.383]  They haven't yet.
[00:57:01.443 --> 00:57:03.446]  I've left messages, and they've sent e-mails.
[00:57:04.106 --> 00:57:09.609]  Tell you what, let me put you on hold, and I'll get your phone number, sir.
[00:57:09.629 --> 00:57:12.991]  99% of people don't have a problem, but some do.
[00:57:13.031 --> 00:57:15.212]  I'm going to put you on hold right now.
[00:57:15.232 --> 00:57:16.593]  I got the other one in two and a half weeks.
[00:57:16.713 --> 00:57:18.194]  You got the other one in two and a half weeks?
[00:57:18.354 --> 00:57:18.814]  Yeah.
[00:57:18.834 --> 00:57:20.335]  Did you order via the toll-free number?
[00:57:20.675 --> 00:57:21.075]  I sure do.
[00:57:21.376 --> 00:57:31.285]  That's where all the problems are stemming from, and I may drop that service or get a new one, because the operators are writing addresses down wrong, and they're going to people's neighbors and stuff, and it's killing me.
[00:57:31.305 --> 00:57:32.526]  Let me finish.
[00:57:32.766 --> 00:57:33.206]  Number one.
[00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:39.152]  You can always call here to the board op and give me your number.
[00:57:39.172 --> 00:57:39.773]  I'll call you back.
[00:57:39.793 --> 00:57:41.194]  But I can't handle this on air.
[00:57:41.274 --> 00:57:42.395]  I can't help you on air.
[00:57:42.615 --> 00:57:43.777]  I'm in a radio studio.
[00:57:44.077 --> 00:57:45.919]  But every problem is the toll-free number.
[00:57:46.519 --> 00:57:49.783]  And for some reason, we probably got your address wrong.
[00:57:50.423 --> 00:57:51.564]  You got your first video.
[00:57:51.604 --> 00:57:52.585]  We'll get you your videos.
[00:57:52.806 --> 00:57:54.207]  I'm going to put you on hold and get your number.
[00:57:54.247 --> 00:57:54.607]  Thank you.
[00:57:55.448 --> 00:57:58.732]  Let's go ahead now and talk to David in Texas.
[00:57:58.792 --> 00:57:59.672]  David, you're on the air.
[00:57:59.713 --> 00:58:00.073]  Go ahead.
[00:58:01.128 --> 00:58:02.048]  Yes, Alex.
[00:58:02.068 --> 00:58:05.529]  I wanted to call and say thank you to you.
[00:58:05.649 --> 00:58:08.830]  I have been watching you since the mid-90s.
[00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:13.511]  And here into the 2000s, I started getting involved in it myself.
[00:58:13.631 --> 00:58:21.574]  I'm now producing a local show and hooked up with a man that you know, Eric Rainbow.
[00:58:22.074 --> 00:58:22.374]  Yes.
[00:58:23.114 --> 00:58:27.635]  Anyway, I wanted to let you know and your listeners, please get involved.
[00:58:28.916 --> 00:58:29.176]  Also,
[00:58:31.212 --> 00:58:32.673]  I have a few more things.
[00:58:32.713 --> 00:58:34.253]  Well, I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:34.353 --> 00:58:43.617]  We'll talk about it on the other side, and then we'll get to Jess and Jim as well, and we've got Larry Pratt coming up to talk about the Second Amendment.
[00:58:44.358 --> 00:58:45.318]  So stay with us.
[00:58:45.358 --> 00:58:48.720]  This is very important information about what the Supreme Court has done.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:49.320]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:51.818 --> 00:58:53.459]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:58:53.479 --> 00:58:56.542]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:59:19.918 --> 00:59:21.639]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:59:21.899 --> 00:59:33.847]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:59:34.048 --> 00:59:40.532]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[01:00:02.945 --> 01:00:03.746]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.526 --> 01:00:05.427]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.447 --> 01:00:09.770]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:14.373]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.434 --> 01:00:19.336]  All right, folks, we're now into the second hour.
[01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:23.719]  Here in about five minutes, we've got Larry Pratt joining us to talk about the Supreme Court.
[01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:32.218]  Agreeing with the appeals court in San Francisco saying that there is no right to own guns, there is no Second Amendment, basically.
[01:00:32.918 --> 01:00:37.480]  Bunch of other news about our government turning their back on Taiwan, saying don't go for independence.
[01:00:39.001 --> 01:00:41.082]  A bunch of dirty bomb missiles missing.
[01:00:41.402 --> 01:00:42.122]  How convenient.
[01:00:42.162 --> 01:00:42.983]  It's all coming up.
[01:00:43.483 --> 01:00:45.083]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:00:45.163 --> 01:00:45.804]  Let's talk.
[01:00:46.024 --> 01:00:47.384]  Let David in Texas finish up.
[01:00:47.424 --> 01:00:48.045]  Go ahead, David.
[01:00:48.065 --> 01:00:49.445]  Okay, thank you.
[01:00:50.486 --> 01:00:54.047]  I just wanted to make two more points, and then I'll hang up and listen to your comments
[01:00:55.567 --> 01:01:03.509]  I had recently moved out of town farther south into Kyle, and I had to renew my driver's license.
[01:01:03.989 --> 01:01:22.013]  And when I went to renew my driver's license, I ran into a similar situation that I had seen on one of your videos where I didn't refuse to put my thumbprint on the scanner, but I asked questions about it.
[01:01:23.453 --> 01:01:31.119]  Yeah, the biometric scanner putting you into the global database.
[01:01:31.599 --> 01:01:33.160]  I have the Associated Press on that today.
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.201]  We knew this years ago.
[01:01:34.721 --> 01:01:40.365]  But that's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design, where I go in, protest with 100 people, and get arrested.
[01:01:40.745 --> 01:01:43.107]  And so they flew into a rage when you asked questions.
[01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:44.087]  Right.
[01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:44.287]  I...
[01:01:45.552 --> 01:01:59.820]  I didn't refuse to put my thumbprint on there, but I asked questions about it because I know that I put my thumbprint in when I lived in Austin, but immediately the answer I got was, what are you hiding?
[01:02:01.099 --> 01:02:04.542]  Yeah, again, now you're not a criminal, but you've got to be fingerprinted.
[01:02:04.862 --> 01:02:06.283]  You're guilty until proven innocent.
[01:02:06.383 --> 01:02:07.204]  What are you hiding?
[01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:09.746]  Let us put cameras in the school bathrooms.
[01:02:10.046 --> 01:02:11.848]  Let us put cameras up on the street corners.
[01:02:12.148 --> 01:02:13.749]  Let us listen to your cell phones.
[01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.870]  Let us track you.
[01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:15.791]  Let us tax you.
[01:02:15.811 --> 01:02:19.554]  It was very odd because I didn't go there to protest.
[01:02:19.654 --> 01:02:20.855]  I just went there to get my license.
[01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:26.740]  And then before I left, I had a group of officers questioning me.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.161]  I was in a room with them.
[01:02:28.181 --> 01:02:29.442]  They were asking me questions.
[01:02:29.969 --> 01:02:32.291]  It was very odd.
[01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:35.334]  I would love to have you on as a guest.
[01:02:35.354 --> 01:02:40.079]  Send me a letter with your info or send me an email to tipsandinfowars.com.
[01:02:40.379 --> 01:02:43.442]  I'd love to have you on the TV show to talk about that.
[01:02:43.822 --> 01:02:45.944]  You're telling me they pulled you in a room?
[01:02:45.964 --> 01:02:46.945]  What were they asking you?
[01:02:47.766 --> 01:02:52.470]  Well, they were asking me, why don't you want to put your thumbprint in?
[01:02:53.696 --> 01:02:57.697]  Basically, all I was doing was asking, well, I know I've done this in the past.
[01:02:57.797 --> 01:02:58.918]  Why do I have to do it again?
[01:02:59.138 --> 01:03:01.718]  And so you must be evil.
[01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:04.219]  You're not wanting to be fingerprinted like a criminal.
[01:03:04.439 --> 01:03:05.359]  Did you say that to them?
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:06.600]  Well, no.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.860]  I tried to stay as calm as I could.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.981]  So what did the state police officer say to you?
[01:03:11.866 --> 01:03:13.607]  Well, they were questioning me.
[01:03:13.687 --> 01:03:15.268]  Why don't you want to put your thumbprint in?
[01:03:15.788 --> 01:03:16.688]  What are you hiding?
[01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:19.329]  Do you have a criminal record?
[01:03:19.409 --> 01:03:25.972]  They were typing into a computer, and I can only imagine they were looking up my driver's license record.
[01:03:25.992 --> 01:03:28.013]  Yeah, you were basically under arrest, sir.
[01:03:28.093 --> 01:03:31.555]  That was official oppression, false arrest, and you need to sue them.
[01:03:32.655 --> 01:03:33.876]  How long were you in there with them?
[01:03:34.617 --> 01:03:35.657]  Oh, just briefly.
[01:03:35.697 --> 01:03:36.918]  Maybe 15, 20 minutes.
[01:03:37.258 --> 01:03:39.479]  Yeah, well, they were running all these background checks on you.
[01:03:39.579 --> 01:03:39.759]  Sure.
[01:03:39.819 --> 01:03:42.760]  Because you dared to not want to be thumb-scanned.
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:46.261]  And by the way, they're now going in HEB and Kroger's all over the state.
[01:03:47.902 --> 01:03:49.102]  One last thing, and then I'll hang up.
[01:03:49.122 --> 01:03:49.662]  I'll let you go.
[01:03:50.763 --> 01:03:55.304]  I had sent you an email a couple weeks ago, and I wanted to call you about this.
[01:03:57.585 --> 01:04:02.027]  About two or three weeks ago, I heard it from three different sources.
[01:04:02.107 --> 01:04:03.207]  I heard it on NPR.
[01:04:04.033 --> 01:04:05.754]  I heard it on the BBC.
[01:04:05.854 --> 01:04:06.494]  Okay, what did you hear?
[01:04:06.534 --> 01:04:07.274]  We're almost out of time.
[01:04:07.814 --> 01:04:17.898]  Okay, basically they were trying to link Al-Qaeda to being against the world government, against the WTO.
[01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:25.520]  Yeah, Harvard's been saying that, others have, that if you're against globalism, you're with Al-Qaeda, and the right wing secretly works with Al-Qaeda.
[01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:29.752]  Well, see, the thing I don't like is they're linking al-Qaeda to the constitutionalists.
[01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:30.733]  Yeah, I know.
[01:04:30.813 --> 01:04:31.614]  That's the whole point.
[01:04:31.654 --> 01:04:34.196]  That's who FEMA's really out demonizing.
[01:04:34.236 --> 01:04:35.297]  We have that road to tyranny.
[01:04:36.458 --> 01:04:37.059]  Thanks for the call.
[01:04:37.079 --> 01:04:37.660]  I'm out of time.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.401]  We're going to have Larry Pratt on in about 20 minutes.
[01:04:39.421 --> 01:04:40.722]  I know he's a busy man.
[01:04:40.742 --> 01:04:46.408]  I want to get an update on the legislation and also on the court rulings on the Second Amendment.
[01:04:46.828 --> 01:04:51.332]  Then we'll go to Jess and Jim and Raleigh and many others.
[01:04:51.592 --> 01:04:52.053]  Stay with us.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:05:01.947]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:05:02.228 --> 01:05:06.972]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:05:07.192 --> 01:05:12.838]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:05:13.078 --> 01:05:17.602]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:05:17.822 --> 01:05:24.989]  The casual society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:05:25.009 --> 01:05:29.553]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.713 --> 01:05:32.235]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:05:32.435 --> 01:05:39.161]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:05:39.401 --> 01:05:39.702]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:53.374 --> 01:05:56.897]  I have been on collagenate for three months now and I've lost 40 pounds.
[01:05:57.377 --> 01:05:58.839]  40 pounds in three months?
[01:05:59.299 --> 01:06:04.864]  Ann's another listener who took my advice and lost weight the safe and healthy way with collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:06:05.124 --> 01:06:07.346]  I heard about collagenate through radio station.
[01:06:07.706 --> 01:06:09.768]  I've gone down about three dress sizes.
[01:06:09.948 --> 01:06:10.448]  I feel good.
[01:06:10.468 --> 01:06:11.109]  I have energy.
[01:06:11.289 --> 01:06:12.350]  I was really tired before.
[01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:15.292]  I didn't have a lot of energy and I've got three kids, so it was kind of hard to keep up with them.
[01:06:15.432 --> 01:06:16.493]  But now I feel wonderful.
[01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.074]  I've had people notice quite a bit.
[01:06:18.134 --> 01:06:19.856]  They're coming up to me and they're saying, what have you done?
[01:06:19.916 --> 01:06:21.197]  And I went on collagenate.
[01:06:21.738 --> 01:06:25.242]  I have been on collagenate for three months now and I've lost 40 pounds.
[01:06:25.502 --> 01:06:27.104]  Wow, 40 pounds!
[01:06:27.504 --> 01:06:31.309]  This was Ann's personal experience while taking Vim and Vigor's collagenate.
[01:06:31.489 --> 01:06:33.811]  Why don't you see what collagenate can do for you?
[01:06:34.092 --> 01:06:35.553]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:06:35.573 --> 01:06:35.914]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:40.601]  Again, that's 1-800-622-THEN.
[01:06:40.621 --> 01:06:43.603]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:06:55.755 --> 01:06:56.255]  We're good to go.
[01:06:56.276 --> 01:06:56.716]  We're good to go.

[01:07:23.914 --> 01:07:27.675]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.911]  Big Brother.
[01:07:59.551 --> 01:08:00.612]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:01.332 --> 01:08:02.453]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:03.073 --> 01:08:03.893]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.654 --> 01:08:05.614]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:06.235 --> 01:08:09.956]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.397 --> 01:08:12.738]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:14.511]  Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.754 --> 01:08:18.555]  All right, folks.
[01:08:18.755 --> 01:08:21.557]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.100]  We're here live, central time.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:34.969]  I know that we've got Jess and Jim and Raleigh and many, many others that are patiently holding for the next couple of segments.
[01:08:34.989 --> 01:08:39.914]  We're going to have Larry Pratt on with us because the Supreme Court last week reported
[01:08:40.811 --> 01:08:45.315]  Rejected the Silvera v. Lockyer case out of California.
[01:08:45.915 --> 01:08:51.440]  The appeals court out in California and the Attorney General have said that there is no individual right to own guns.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.522]  They can ban any guns they want whenever they want.
[01:08:53.542 --> 01:08:57.305]  The Supreme Court said, yeah, we're just going to let that ruling stand.
[01:08:58.064 --> 01:08:59.426]  Alex, it's good to be with you, as always.
[01:09:18.299 --> 01:09:23.061]  About a month ago we had you on about the NRA in a federal lawsuit in D.C.
[01:09:23.081 --> 01:09:26.203]  saying we don't care if guns are registered and you can't leave your house without them.
[01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.044]  That was their compromise.
[01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:35.107]  Now the Cato Institute has alleged the NRA is trying to mess with their suits and stop those.
[01:09:36.007 --> 01:09:43.410]  The NRA has done nothing with this Silvera case, and now the Supreme Court ruled on this or refused to rule last Monday.
[01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:44.971]  What does this mean, Larry Pratt?
[01:09:45.931 --> 01:09:48.212]  Well, it could be worse.
[01:09:49.013 --> 01:09:51.174]  It wasn't the happiest result, obviously.
[01:09:51.794 --> 01:10:00.218]  But the Fifth Circuit has ruled just the opposite, and they have held that the Second Amendment does, in fact, protect an individual right.
[01:10:00.658 --> 01:10:07.041]  So the Supreme Court, for whatever reason, has decided to leave that tension among the circuits.
[01:10:07.841 --> 01:10:10.763]  The Ninth Circuit, actually, that's not a new opinion of theirs.
[01:10:10.803 --> 01:10:15.105]  They've had this very wrong-headed view for a long time.
[01:10:16.265 --> 01:10:21.348]  The Fifth Circuit, I guess their opinion's been out now for at least a couple of years.
[01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:23.130]  And that was out of the Texas case.
[01:10:23.190 --> 01:10:26.872]  Now, they said it is an individual right unless prescribed by law.
[01:10:26.912 --> 01:10:28.513]  Well, that's the same thing we've heard from Ashcroft.
[01:10:28.533 --> 01:10:30.594]  That means, yeah, you got it, but we can restrict it.
[01:10:31.275 --> 01:10:36.658]  That's bad enough, but to have the Supreme Court not hearing the Ninth, I don't know.
[01:10:37.098 --> 01:10:40.100]  I'd like to put this so-called conservative court to the test.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:44.923]  Well, indeed, and we may or may not be pleased with the outcome, which is always the
[01:10:46.019 --> 01:10:48.180]  The chance that you take when you go before the court.
[01:10:49.421 --> 01:11:07.416]  Back in 1990, the same folks that are on the court ruled that the Second Amendment, with its language of the people, refers to an individual right every bit as much as anywhere else in the Bill of Rights that that term, that phrase, is used.
[01:11:07.957 --> 01:11:12.741]  Now, that would make you think that if they were consistent, and if is a mighty big word,
[01:11:13.408 --> 01:11:23.313]  If they were consistent, then when they do take a case, they would have to rule for being consistent that it's an individual right.
[01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:30.716]  The Cato case is probably the best case that will ever get to the Supreme Court, and that's why they put it together.
[01:11:31.477 --> 01:11:35.679]  They thought someday some cases... Well, we've had them on the show.
[01:11:35.719 --> 01:11:38.640]  They say the NRA's been sneaking around trying to stop them.
[01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:45.265]  Well, I think Cato succeeded in derailing any efforts to sidetrack.
[01:11:45.666 --> 01:11:48.648]  Why is the NRA, Larry, trying to block everybody?
[01:11:48.688 --> 01:11:50.249]  They tried to block us in Texas.
[01:11:50.769 --> 01:11:59.215]  Well, in the case of Cato, there was a disagreement over whether you should give the court what you might call a smorgasbord of options.
[01:12:00.536 --> 01:12:07.121]  Not just the Second Amendment, but hey, maybe you want to rule on Commerce Clause, maybe you want to rule on
[01:12:07.628 --> 01:12:16.090]  This, that, or the other thing, and for all I know, their case may have four or five different options that the court could use to give... But hasn't that always been the smart way to do it?
[01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:22.552]  Well, I don't have any problem with that myself, because that's kind of... I figure any way you kill a snake is a good way.
[01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:32.354]  But Cato figured, well, at some point, somebody's going to get a rotten case up to the Supreme Court, and that will be the basis of a Second Amendment ruling.
[01:12:32.634 --> 01:12:36.575]  Better to do... What they've done is two things that are singular.
[01:12:37.099 --> 01:12:41.200]  They, first of all, made a case from the District of Columbia.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:51.422]  Therefore, the court can't hide behind this, oh, well, states still are protected by the original constitutional arrangement.
[01:12:51.442 --> 01:12:53.843]  It's got to be a totally federal jurisdiction.
[01:12:54.163 --> 01:12:55.003]  Totally federal.
[01:12:55.343 --> 01:12:59.944]  No games that they can play about it being a state and the arguments they could use on that.
[01:13:00.364 --> 01:13:03.685]  Secondly, they have a rainbow of plaintiffs.
[01:13:05.325 --> 01:13:07.166]  In fact, one of them is a homosexual.
[01:13:07.206 --> 01:13:23.897]  Another one is a taxi driver, a taxi commissioner, a lady that lives in a neighborhood full of druggies that threatens her and has threatened her life, a housewife that went through seven months to get a lousy shotgun so she could keep it disarmed in her apartment.
[01:13:24.537 --> 01:13:30.241]  All these people are bringing suit from the District of Columbia just on the Second Amendment.
[01:13:30.701 --> 01:13:33.663]  So Cato is saying, okay, Supremes,
[01:13:34.301 --> 01:13:39.805]  If you want to tell us what you think the Second Amendment means, here is the case.
[01:13:41.527 --> 01:13:45.930]  And they don't want to do that, at least in the past they don't, because they're going to rule anti-gun.
[01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:50.233]  You watch, it'll look like on the surface it's pro-gun, but in the meat it'll be anti-gun.
[01:13:50.273 --> 01:13:52.815]  At least that's what they've done with their neocon actions in the past.
[01:13:53.076 --> 01:13:56.538]  Because they don't want to state it for everybody that they are after our guns.
[01:13:57.039 --> 01:13:57.319]  They've been...
[01:13:58.104 --> 01:14:04.545]  More and more brazen about going and openly referring to foreign law, whether it be a U.N.
[01:14:04.605 --> 01:14:11.927]  treaty or something they saw in Brussels during their last junket there, but whatever the European community is doing.
[01:14:12.487 --> 01:14:21.229]  And they're using that, which is really quite in violation of their oath of office, which has them upholding, defending the Constitution.
[01:14:21.829 --> 01:14:22.449]  And here they are...
[01:14:23.408 --> 01:14:27.231]  Forgetting, if you will, that the Constitution says it's the highest authority.
[01:14:27.271 --> 01:14:33.455]  Well, Larry, we started America, the United States, to get away from the mercantile British oligarchy.
[01:14:34.175 --> 01:14:39.018]  And now most of the Supreme Court's on record going, oh yeah, we're going to rule according to European law.
[01:14:39.259 --> 01:14:40.199]  There are no juries.
[01:14:40.239 --> 01:14:41.420]  There's no free speech.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.241]  There's double jeopardy.
[01:14:43.682 --> 01:14:45.002]  I mean, it's total tyranny.
[01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:46.984]  And they've all been saying, get used to it.
[01:14:47.204 --> 01:14:48.365]  We're going to follow the U.N.
[01:14:48.405 --> 01:14:48.705]  model.
[01:14:49.369 --> 01:15:07.379]  That's clearly where the court has been willing to go, and I think that bodes very ill for not just the Second Amendment, but frankly, any of our constitutional structures, the rights that are protected in the Bill of Rights, the limitations that are placed on the government.
[01:15:07.939 --> 01:15:13.482]  They're basically saying, no holds barred, we're the Supreme Legislature here in the Supreme Court.
[01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:14.743]  We make the law.
[01:15:15.282 --> 01:15:16.823]  We're above everybody else.
[01:15:16.843 --> 01:15:21.226]  And, of course, that is exactly 180 degrees from what the founders had in mind.
[01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:31.033]  The Supreme Court is supposed to decide an issue between two parties, and when they have a decision, it only applies to those two parties.
[01:15:31.533 --> 01:15:40.539]  They can't make a ruling that becomes the law of the land because they are not the highest interpreter of what that law of the land is to be.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:43.101]  When you're talking about Judge Roy Moore, he...
[01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:49.515]  Can't have violated a legitimate court order, although that's what most people think.
[01:15:49.535 --> 01:15:51.337]  Well, rule of law, court order.
[01:15:51.737 --> 01:15:59.165]  No, if the court order is wrong, you don't obey it because Roy Moore took the same oath of office that those other Jaspers did.
[01:15:59.666 --> 01:16:04.891]  And if there's a real conflict, then you let the people decide.
[01:16:05.011 --> 01:16:06.353]  We the people, after all.
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:13.025]  That's the way the preamble starts out in the Constitution, and we're the ones to make those ultimate decisions.
[01:16:13.125 --> 01:16:17.608]  Well, Larry, boil it down what the Supreme Court did with the Ninth Circuit.
[01:16:17.628 --> 01:16:20.470]  Now, the Ninth Circuit said we can ban any gun we want whenever we want.
[01:16:20.871 --> 01:16:23.212]  There's no individual right to keep and bear arms.
[01:16:23.232 --> 01:16:28.816]  The Supreme Court threw it back and said we're not going to rule on it, which adds validity to that Ninth Circuit court ruling.
[01:16:29.437 --> 01:16:34.721]  Yeah, and it says for now the states in that jurisdiction can go off in that cockamamie direction.
[01:16:35.256 --> 01:16:39.920]  But I'm hearing about Ohio and others saying they're going to use that Ninth Circuit ruling.
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:42.802]  Well, the comeback is, what about the Fifth Circuit, fellas?
[01:16:43.282 --> 01:16:44.903]  What about the 1990 opinion that the court had
[01:17:02.449 --> 01:17:06.632]  About the people, the right of the people to keep and bear arms.
[01:17:06.652 --> 01:17:17.559]  Well, that's clearly, and this professor, this lying professor that's been kicked out of the college now for saying that the Founding Fathers weren't for guns, I mean, that's like saying that fire isn't hot or the sun doesn't come in the morning.
[01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:29.087]  But shifting gears into legislation, the strengthening of the NICS Act, which is turning total information awareness and the Patriot Act loose on gun owners in your own analysis, where is that right now?
[01:17:30.148 --> 01:17:30.528]  For the...
[01:17:31.132 --> 01:17:32.693]  Rest of the year, we can rejoice.
[01:17:33.033 --> 01:17:33.894]  They're gone.
[01:17:34.014 --> 01:17:34.735]  They're gone.
[01:17:34.755 --> 01:17:42.100]  I don't think they're going to be getting to it, even with any last-minute business that they might want to take care of.
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.562]  Well, for those that don't know, we know it'll be back next year.
[01:17:44.662 --> 01:17:46.643]  Recap what this legislation did.
[01:17:46.824 --> 01:17:59.673]  Well, it's supposedly going to provide a lot of money so that states can afford to computerize the records of people that would disqualify them from owning a gun that haven't been
[01:18:00.069 --> 01:18:17.316]  ...computerized yet, and some of them arguably can get a gun because of the absence of the disqualifying information in the National Computer Database, the National Information Crime System, NICS, as you correctly pronounced it, as we do here inside the Beltway.
[01:18:17.376 --> 01:18:19.397]  That shows you're really on the know.
[01:18:20.438 --> 01:18:25.440]  But the zinger in this legislation goes well beyond that.
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.881]  We don't agree with that part of the legislation whatsoever.
[01:18:28.442 --> 01:18:28.702]  Either.
[01:18:28.802 --> 01:18:34.808]  That's not constitutional, and that's become a registration scheme for everybody who has his name checked against it.
[01:18:35.248 --> 01:18:43.316]  But what we're talking about is letting the FBI obtain everybody's IRS health and employment records.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:49.845]  So that they can go trolling for anybody else that might possibly ought to be in the disqualified list.
[01:18:49.945 --> 01:19:00.494]  Well, Larry, what this really is, as you said last time, is funding for total information awareness and it's the coupling point from the federal to the state level for the new matrix system.
[01:19:01.315 --> 01:19:01.915]  Absolutely.
[01:19:02.336 --> 01:19:04.077]  It is exactly that.
[01:19:04.818 --> 01:19:12.044]  The Brady Bill all along has provided the structure for that and what we're seeing here is really little more than
[01:19:12.628 --> 01:19:20.430]  Filling in some blank spaces that were left, but within the existing structure of the instant background check and the whole Brady system.
[01:19:22.051 --> 01:19:23.411]  Larry, one more quick segment.
[01:19:23.431 --> 01:19:25.492]  I want to come back and talk about education.
[01:19:25.532 --> 01:19:31.073]  You guys helped block a bill that would have allowed them to demonize the Second Amendment with school children, but that's really where the big fight is.
[01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:34.774]  At the local level, they're brainwashing the children.
[01:19:34.814 --> 01:19:38.635]  You can't even say the word gun or write about it in an essay or they act like you've committed a thought crime.
[01:19:38.655 --> 01:19:40.456]  I want to talk about that and how we...
[01:19:41.368 --> 01:19:43.832]  Force Bush not to sign the assault weapons ban.
[01:19:44.273 --> 01:19:44.874]  Re-sign it.
[01:19:44.914 --> 01:19:46.177]  Re-authorize it next year.
[01:19:46.818 --> 01:19:51.125]  Then we'll go to Jess and Jim and Raleigh and everybody in New York.
[01:19:51.185 --> 01:19:52.027]  Everybody stay there.
[01:19:52.067 --> 01:19:52.428]  We'll be back.
[01:19:53.818 --> 01:19:59.721]  Oh my... I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:19:59.881 --> 01:20:00.521]  Yes, it's true.
[01:20:00.541 --> 01:20:03.263]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:20:03.403 --> 01:20:07.365]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:20:07.465 --> 01:20:08.045]  You heard it right.
[01:20:08.185 --> 01:20:13.167]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:14.288]  The list goes on and on.
[01:20:14.428 --> 01:20:14.848]  We're good to go.
[01:20:31.186 --> 01:20:31.746]  We're good to go.
[01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:54.490]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:59.351]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:20:59.511 --> 01:21:07.313]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:21:07.593 --> 01:21:12.954]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:21:13.154 --> 01:21:20.136]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:21:20.396 --> 01:21:21.556]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237
[01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:49.751]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:22:17.316 --> 01:22:27.780]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:22:28.061 --> 01:22:28.561]  That's right.
[01:22:28.741 --> 01:22:35.864]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:22:36.144 --> 01:22:44.728]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:22:45.708 --> 01:22:46.909]  888-803-4438.
[01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:51.952]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:22:52.152 --> 01:22:57.675]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the ARC Institute.
[01:22:57.755 --> 01:23:04.579]  You'll get 25 big packets of ARC's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds, plus four of their most popular self-reliance books.
[01:23:04.859 --> 01:23:05.400]  We're good to go.
[01:23:21.295 --> 01:23:24.257]  Preserve your good food for years with the USDA Canning Guide.
[01:23:24.497 --> 01:23:30.560]  In surviving a bioterrorist attack, you'll learn how to protect yourself and your family now from the attacks our government says are coming.
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:31.680]  Not if, but when.
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:38.443]  Normally selling for $140 plus shipping, get this whole package now for only $69 and shipping is free.
[01:23:38.704 --> 01:23:39.944]  At half price, supplies are limited.
[01:23:40.124 --> 01:23:41.505]  For credit card orders, call today, 1-800-255-1912.
[01:23:43.866 --> 01:23:48.809]  That's 800-255-1912 or send a money order for $69 to the ARC Institute.
[01:23:48.949 --> 01:23:49.190]  P.O.
[01:23:49.210 --> 01:23:52.091]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[01:23:57.215 --> 01:23:57.775]  All right, folks.
[01:23:57.835 --> 01:24:03.079]  Coming up in the next segment, a bunch of other key news on the economy, the war, you name it.
[01:24:03.519 --> 01:24:08.362]  Jess, Jim, Ron, Roger, Leslie, and all the other great callers we're going to get to you.
[01:24:08.942 --> 01:24:10.443]  We're talking to Larry Pratt right now.
[01:24:10.944 --> 01:24:11.404]  Larry Pratt.
[01:24:12.341 --> 01:24:13.681]  The brainwashing of the children.
[01:24:14.502 --> 01:24:17.703]  Gun owners are the majority in this country, conservatives are the majority.
[01:24:18.083 --> 01:24:20.664]  How do we stop the brainwashing of the children?
[01:24:20.684 --> 01:24:26.705]  Because Josh Sugarman a couple years ago in a local article in the paper of Violence Policy Center said, look, we've got your kids.
[01:24:26.966 --> 01:24:28.586]  We're going to ban your guns eventually.
[01:24:28.806 --> 01:24:29.846]  They're right out in the open.
[01:24:29.926 --> 01:24:31.167]  How do we stop this?
[01:24:32.387 --> 01:24:41.450]  And we don't stop them and expect exactly to lose our kids and watch them vote against the very freedoms that we hold dear.
[01:24:42.611 --> 01:24:50.475]  One of the ways we can do it, of course, the way my grandchildren are being educated, is to get them out of the government schools.
[01:24:50.975 --> 01:24:57.998]  But for those that are in the government schools, we can certainly try to keep real poison from being given to them.
[01:24:58.378 --> 01:25:05.562]  And that's what was being fashioned for them under this Presidential Academies Bill, H.R.
[01:25:05.582 --> 01:25:08.863]  1078, that would have... Federalized curriculum further.
[01:25:09.643 --> 01:25:10.464]  It would have had the...
[01:25:11.428 --> 01:25:17.473]  New standards for history and civics being taught by... Frankly, it didn't say.
[01:25:17.493 --> 01:25:19.755]  It was a blank check for the education department.
[01:25:20.095 --> 01:25:29.463]  But given their track record, that meant every left-wing professor in the country would have been eligible to apply for a grant to run one of these academies in his state.
[01:25:29.943 --> 01:25:36.628]  And thus, he could brainwash the teachers so that they could turn around and brainwash the kids about the history of our country.
[01:25:36.889 --> 01:25:38.490]  But you guys helped defeat that.
[01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:39.351]  So far.
[01:25:39.531 --> 01:25:40.832]  Now, this year, it's dead...
[01:25:41.408 --> 01:25:46.997]  Next year, they're going to make a comeback at it because I think the president wants to appear to the soccer moms.
[01:25:47.017 --> 01:25:53.368]  He's the education president, and so they're going to try to push something through on teaching civics and history.
[01:25:53.388 --> 01:25:54.630]  Now let's talk about...
[01:25:55.356 --> 01:26:00.338]  Next year, the assault weapons ban, when it's up for a vote, Bush says he'll reauthorize it.
[01:26:00.358 --> 01:26:02.598]  They're trying to tag more gun control onto it.
[01:26:03.919 --> 01:26:04.859]  When's that vote coming up?
[01:26:04.879 --> 01:26:05.639]  What do you see happening?
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.521]  Well, September 14 is the pumpkin day for the other side.
[01:26:10.641 --> 01:26:16.963]  If they don't get something signed by the president by that time, then the ban goes away.
[01:26:17.703 --> 01:26:19.564]  So they have to pass a bill, and
[01:26:20.394 --> 01:26:22.695]  Frankly, that gives us a tactical advantage.
[01:26:22.855 --> 01:26:29.619]  Well, that's also going to be hard for a Republican Congress to act like they're conservative and reauthorize, but they're saying they will.
[01:26:30.039 --> 01:26:40.504]  They're saying they will, and frankly, it's easier for us as an interest group, gun owners of America, to be able to block things that are trying to be enacted.
[01:26:41.544 --> 01:26:48.868]  I can tell you it's a lot harder to enact a bill than it is to beat a bill, and that gives us at least one leg up.
[01:26:49.927 --> 01:26:50.828]  But I agree with you.
[01:26:50.868 --> 01:26:52.550]  The pressures are going to mount.
[01:26:53.171 --> 01:26:57.757]  There'll be a media campaign that will be ferocious.
[01:26:58.378 --> 01:27:02.363]  Howard Dean has already pretty well come out of the closet as an anti-gunner.
[01:27:03.175 --> 01:27:05.215]  And he will be singing that song.
[01:27:05.576 --> 01:27:09.676]  He's already said for a month now that he supports renewing the band.
[01:27:09.996 --> 01:27:11.517]  And Al Gore just endorsed him.
[01:27:12.317 --> 01:27:15.898]  And certainly Al Gore wouldn't endorse somebody like you or me.
[01:27:16.258 --> 01:27:20.959]  So we can assume that Mr. Dean is pretty much like Al Gore, and that's bad.
[01:27:22.139 --> 01:27:23.579]  Al Gore is real bad.
[01:27:23.899 --> 01:27:24.639]  Certainly is.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.740]  Anyway, I think there's going to be a fight.
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:30.681]  I think it's one that we can win.
[01:27:30.741 --> 01:27:32.261]  I still think that that's possible.
[01:27:32.785 --> 01:27:43.611]  But anybody that says we got it in the bag may be the reason why we lose, because we're going to have to remain very vigilant and diligent to be able to... So call early, call late, call often.
[01:27:43.631 --> 01:27:44.212]  Amen.
[01:27:44.272 --> 01:27:49.175]  Show up when your congressman or woman is at the local shindig, get in their face about this.
[01:27:49.275 --> 01:28:00.341]  And I hope folks will go to gunowners.org, our website, and sign up for our e-mail bulletins, which will let them know when timely contact can be made on this issue.
[01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.002]  And forward those to everybody.
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:03.641]  Oh, yes.
[01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:05.662]  That really helps when that happens.
[01:28:05.742 --> 01:28:06.963]  I appreciate your mentioning that.
[01:28:07.503 --> 01:28:09.084]  Well, that's the force multiplication.
[01:28:09.124 --> 01:28:15.708]  I mean, we've got millions of listeners every week to this show, 800 to a million at any one time listening.
[01:28:15.768 --> 01:28:23.153]  If they'll all just take action, with this show alone we can effect change, and with all the other great talk shows and all the other great gun owners.
[01:28:23.793 --> 01:28:27.575]  Well, I think the founders had it right when they said more than once that eternal vigilance
[01:28:50.708 --> 01:28:54.711]  GunOwners.org Larry Pratt, I appreciate you coming on on short notice, and God bless.

[01:33:24.469 --> 01:33:25.710]  It's all very, very important.
[01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:31.274]  So let's just bam, bam, bam, questions or comments on any of the issues we've raised or any news items you want to discuss.
[01:33:31.974 --> 01:33:33.295]  Jess in New Jersey, go ahead.
[01:33:33.335 --> 01:33:33.915]  You're on the air.
[01:33:34.656 --> 01:33:35.456]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:33:35.837 --> 01:33:36.137]  Welcome.
[01:33:36.775 --> 01:33:46.360]  I wanted to talk about, you know, I was listening to your guest commenting on gun control and the ferocious media campaign in support of these draconian measures.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:48.782]  I mean, it's actually more than that.
[01:33:48.842 --> 01:33:57.787]  It's a psychological warfare technique that's being, you know, unleashed upon the populace here in America, and in Britain, too, when one looks at, like, the events like Dunblane.
[01:33:57.807 --> 01:34:02.430]  I mean, that was a total, it had, like, a special operation written all over it.
[01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:04.851]  So did Columbine.
[01:34:06.047 --> 01:34:06.567]  Right, right.
[01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:16.411]  Columbine, I feel, was just a precursor to some kind of event that's going to catalyze the total banning of gun control ownership in this country probably within the next year.
[01:34:16.431 --> 01:34:17.791]  I mean, I hope that's not the case.
[01:34:17.831 --> 01:34:18.931]  Well, they've got to disarm us.
[01:34:18.951 --> 01:34:20.852]  They've got such horrible stuff planned for us.
[01:34:20.872 --> 01:34:24.874]  I mean, here's the New York Times talking about emergency camps for us today.
[01:34:25.894 --> 01:34:26.074]  Right.
[01:34:26.673 --> 01:34:38.303]  I'm not sure what we're going to do to compete with the propaganda, such as Bowling for Columbine by Michael Moore, who's basically a Time Warner employee.
[01:34:38.603 --> 01:34:40.705]  Yeah, very sophisticated propaganda.
[01:34:41.085 --> 01:34:41.306]  Right.
[01:34:41.626 --> 01:34:46.910]  And notice he's going to have a new 9-11 film exposing Bush, but it's all leftist, like, oh, it's just Bush.
[01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:48.632]  No, Bush is just a puppet.
[01:34:49.552 --> 01:34:50.053]  Exactly.
[01:34:50.073 --> 01:34:51.234]  I mean...
[01:34:51.889 --> 01:35:03.492]  And not only that, you look at these new sniper cases that are all over, but subtly on the news and in the paper, it's just a constant signal of fear that's being broadcast.
[01:35:03.532 --> 01:35:06.333]  Well, what does the Northwoods U.S.
[01:35:06.373 --> 01:35:10.234]  government official terror plan call for, committing sniper attacks in D.C.
[01:35:10.274 --> 01:35:12.175]  and Miami, and even how to frame patsies?
[01:35:13.095 --> 01:35:13.315]  Right.
[01:35:13.476 --> 01:35:16.299]  But logically, what's the next step?
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.722]  What are we going to see?
[01:35:19.102 --> 01:35:22.866]  What's the next type of event that's going to catalyze all this banning?
[01:35:25.767 --> 01:35:33.469]  We've got to explain to folks that no matter how much crime there is, and our crime rate's actually way down, no matter how much crime there is, that's all the more reason for us to have guns.
[01:35:33.509 --> 01:35:36.009]  The highest crime rates are in New York and D.C.
[01:35:36.469 --> 01:35:39.250]  and Chicago with the gun bans, folks.
[01:35:39.330 --> 01:35:40.190]  It's common sense.
[01:35:40.230 --> 01:35:40.810]  Thanks for the call.
[01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:41.630]  Great points, Jess.
[01:35:41.650 --> 01:35:42.211]  Thanks for holding.
[01:35:42.811 --> 01:35:43.691]  Jim in Colorado.
[01:35:43.731 --> 01:35:44.291]  Welcome, sir.
[01:35:44.331 --> 01:35:44.711]  Go ahead.
[01:35:44.931 --> 01:35:45.351]  Hi, Alex.
[01:35:45.791 --> 01:35:46.111]  Welcome.
[01:35:46.291 --> 01:35:50.452]  I'm dependent on God for my words because I'm not a real good verbal communicator, but... Sounds like you are.
[01:35:50.672 --> 01:35:51.332]  I'm not really.
[01:35:51.573 --> 01:35:53.653]  Sometimes I'll get all discombobulated, but...
[01:35:54.264 --> 01:36:11.051]  The reason I called is to say that we're encouraged here in Colorado from your program, and we're fellows in the body of Christ with you, and we're encouraging people out there to identify the strongholds of wickedness in this land and to come against it.
[01:36:11.171 --> 01:36:21.376]  And we're personally in a real heavy letter campaign to the President and to other people like Gloria Felt against Planned Parenthood, and we're
[01:36:21.966 --> 01:36:23.246]  I think we're good to go.
[01:36:23.266 --> 01:36:24.727]  I think we're good to go.
[01:36:44.203 --> 01:36:51.307]  Well, globalists can't get away with any of their evil if good men and women stand up.
[01:36:51.347 --> 01:36:53.628]  But when we do nothing, evil flourishes.
[01:36:53.708 --> 01:36:59.711]  And the evil has grown now so great that finally people are waking up because it's become so obvious.
[01:37:00.331 --> 01:37:01.732]  Yeah, and I want to thank you for your program.
[01:37:02.052 --> 01:37:10.417]  You have personally encouraged me to be vigilant and to reveal certain information to me that you're a resource of study for me.
[01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:13.552]  Your information and your website and everything.
[01:37:13.592 --> 01:37:17.395]  And I just want to encourage people out there to come against Planned Parenthood.
[01:37:17.475 --> 01:37:18.916]  It's one wicked organization.
[01:37:19.176 --> 01:37:28.302]  Well, Margaret Sanger, the founder of it, gave awards to Hitler, got awards from Hitler, but you don't hear Jesse Jackson saying take down statues of her and take her name off buildings.
[01:37:29.703 --> 01:37:29.883]  Right.
[01:37:29.943 --> 01:37:32.605]  And we're coming in Matthew 18, 18 through 20.
[01:37:33.006 --> 01:37:40.731]  I don't want to get real heavy into scriptural references and stuff, but if you look in Matthew 18, 18 through 20, we have the power over wickedness
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:41.880]  Absolutely.
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:43.140]  We're God's design and power.
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:44.081]  We have the power.
[01:37:44.101 --> 01:37:51.862]  And I want to encourage people to take your information and other people's information in the power and authority of Jesus Christ and to go out there and attack.
[01:37:52.022 --> 01:37:56.403]  Carpet bomb, pinpoint attack, and run wickedness out of this land.
[01:37:56.703 --> 01:37:58.963]  By carpet bomb, you mean in the information war?
[01:37:59.183 --> 01:38:00.844]  Yeah, right, and in spiritual prayers.
[01:38:01.144 --> 01:38:07.505]  Carpet bomb the entire land against wickedness and pinpoint wickedness where it is and do letter campaigns.
[01:38:08.275 --> 01:38:12.318]  Hey, it all helps letting them know that we're aware of what they're doing.
[01:38:12.338 --> 01:38:13.179]  Thanks for the call, Jim.
[01:38:13.559 --> 01:38:14.320]  Good to hear from you.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:15.501]  Ron in New York.
[01:38:15.581 --> 01:38:16.802]  Ron, thanks for holding patiently.
[01:38:16.822 --> 01:38:17.322]  You're on the air.
[01:38:17.362 --> 01:38:17.722]  Go ahead.
[01:38:17.742 --> 01:38:18.463]  Hi, Alex.
[01:38:19.464 --> 01:38:19.904]  I'm sorry.
[01:38:19.924 --> 01:38:20.825]  Mr. Pratt had to go.
[01:38:20.865 --> 01:38:26.709]  I wanted to ask him a question about a piece of legislation which was passed in the House of Representatives yesterday.
[01:38:26.749 --> 01:38:33.934]  They had a funding and a finance bill, and supposedly attached to that funding bill were some provisions...
[01:38:35.563 --> 01:38:39.164]  Well, Larry didn't have to go.
[01:38:39.465 --> 01:38:41.005]  I wanted to get to your calls in the news.
[01:38:41.165 --> 01:38:41.425]  Yeah.
[01:38:42.165 --> 01:38:47.027]  And there was supposedly provisions to that bill that was supposed to be pro-gun.
[01:38:47.687 --> 01:38:52.309]  I was wondering about that, you know, if there weren't devils in the detail of that legislation.
[01:38:52.329 --> 01:38:54.830]  That was passed in the House yesterday.
[01:38:54.850 --> 01:38:58.031]  I don't know if you're familiar with it or...
[01:38:58.624 --> 01:39:00.405]  What was the particular piece of legislation?
[01:39:00.865 --> 01:39:17.596]  Well, it was a funding bill, and they attached onto this funding bill some aspects to reduce some funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to prohibit them from the type of searches and raids of gun shops that they've been conducting, unannounced type searches.
[01:39:18.696 --> 01:39:21.358]  And I forget, there was a third provision.
[01:39:21.718 --> 01:39:26.361]  Well, I mean, last year, they roughly doubled the funding, broke ground on a giant...
[01:39:27.089 --> 01:39:28.229]  Well, then it's that type of game, then.
[01:39:28.249 --> 01:39:31.770]  Put them ten steps ahead, pull them one step back, and say it's something, you've done something.
[01:39:53.782 --> 01:39:56.324]  Well, I haven't seen the particular piece of legislation, so I don't know that.
[01:39:56.344 --> 01:40:08.935]  But I know whether it's TIPS or Total Information or Homeland Security or Patriot Act, they'll repeal one provision in the House, doesn't pass the Senate, then they repass the same provision under a new bill name.
[01:40:09.615 --> 01:40:15.600]  That's why I asked the question, because the way they legislate today, it's always trickery and it's always tomfoolery.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:17.101]  It's never straightforward and honorable.
[01:40:17.121 --> 01:40:18.502]  Skullduggery, another good term.
[01:40:18.603 --> 01:40:19.223]  All the time.
[01:40:19.763 --> 01:40:20.264]  All the time.
[01:40:20.802 --> 01:40:22.042]  And I was wondering about that.
[01:40:22.082 --> 01:40:29.765]  I mean, I could be mistaken, but I'm understandably suspect of any type of legislation that Congress deals with with reference to guns.
[01:40:29.845 --> 01:40:33.946]  Now, I just, you know, you might say, in that respect, I'm from Missouri.
[01:40:33.966 --> 01:40:34.786]  I have to be shown.
[01:40:34.846 --> 01:40:36.767]  I just don't believe them at face value.
[01:40:36.907 --> 01:40:38.288]  The good old show me state.
[01:40:38.548 --> 01:40:39.228]  Thanks for the call.
[01:40:39.648 --> 01:40:41.129]  Appreciate it, Ron.
[01:40:41.269 --> 01:40:42.489]  Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:40:42.529 --> 01:40:43.489]  Roger, pleasure.
[01:40:43.529 --> 01:40:44.009]  Go ahead.
[01:40:44.129 --> 01:40:45.190]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:46.450]  I just want to highlight this thing.
[01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:48.811]  I was kind of hoping to get on with Larry, but you'll do just as fine.
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:41:11.080]  And then, because you had brought up with the Judge Roy Moore thing or other rulings, and to highlight why the Alabama Supremes, that is not including Judge Roy Moore and that ethics panel, why they have got to go, because each of them, there is their non-stated, implicit way of saying, you will not now...
[01:41:11.781 --> 01:41:17.163]  Nor ten years from now ever challenge the federal hammerlock power grab.
[01:41:17.243 --> 01:41:19.684]  Well, yeah, they won't let abortion get up there.
[01:41:19.724 --> 01:41:20.844]  They won't let the Second Amendment.
[01:41:20.864 --> 01:41:22.825]  They won't let border disputes get up there.
[01:41:22.845 --> 01:41:26.666]  And we have a Republican court going after Roy Moore.
[01:41:26.766 --> 01:41:28.346]  I mean, this is the evidence, folks.
[01:41:28.926 --> 01:41:33.928]  You'll never challenge this power grab where the Supremes invented the incorporation doctrine out of the 14th.
[01:41:33.948 --> 01:41:34.108]  And...
[01:41:37.190 --> 01:41:50.981]  In other words, I'm told by Howard Phillips, and he says he has links to this on his website, because he says in Judge Moore's certiorari plea, the briefs for that included, in fact, a direct challenge to this, if I understood him correctly.
[01:41:51.041 --> 01:41:57.647]  And I guess there's the text or links to his actual briefs up on conservativecaucus.com or whatever.
[01:41:58.878 --> 01:42:00.959]  Okay, Roger, thank you for the call.
[01:42:01.899 --> 01:42:03.780]  I'm going to try to talk to Leslie and Chris.
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:05.860]  I know we've got loaded phones here, folks.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.302]  I've got to get to some more of this news before this hour ends, but real quick, Leslie in Tennessee, go ahead.
[01:42:10.322 --> 01:42:11.302]  Hey, it's Wesley.
[01:42:12.222 --> 01:42:12.703]  Wesley.
[01:42:12.963 --> 01:42:13.603]  Yeah, that's okay.
[01:42:14.003 --> 01:42:15.364]  Wesley, I apologize.
[01:42:15.404 --> 01:42:16.344]  I was told Leslie.
[01:42:16.724 --> 01:42:17.564]  I've been called worse.
[01:42:17.864 --> 01:42:18.785]  Oh, well, you're Wesley.
[01:42:18.845 --> 01:42:19.525]  I apologize.
[01:42:19.545 --> 01:42:19.905]  Go ahead.
[01:42:19.925 --> 01:42:21.205]  No, no, that's okay, Alex.
[01:42:21.305 --> 01:42:22.386]  Like I say, I've been called worse.
[01:42:23.046 --> 01:42:25.807]  I just wanted to offer this up for...
[01:42:26.431 --> 01:42:27.072]  Food for thought.
[01:42:27.212 --> 01:42:40.001]  If people aren't convinced by now that the people like George Bush and the various leaders of countries around the world are nothing more than lapdogs or the globalists, consider this fact.
[01:42:41.602 --> 01:42:52.010]  The United States just is holding up one-third of a billion dollars in guaranteed loans to Israel because they're ticked off about their building a fence
[01:42:52.475 --> 01:42:55.017]  To keep terrorists from just walking into their neighborhoods.
[01:42:55.257 --> 01:42:57.578]  Hey, why can't we have a fence on our border?
[01:42:58.119 --> 01:42:59.640]  You know, I'll tell you, that's a real good question.
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:05.924]  You know, they paid tens of billions of dollars for a fence and guard checks every few miles all the way around Afghanistan.
[01:43:06.204 --> 01:43:07.765]  Why can't we have that?
[01:43:07.845 --> 01:43:10.347]  We're paying for it in Afghanistan!
[01:43:10.667 --> 01:43:11.207]  Absolutely.
[01:43:11.708 --> 01:43:12.749]  It's the absolute truth.
[01:43:13.409 --> 01:43:17.312]  The other thing is this recent threat of the United States against...
[01:43:19.232 --> 01:43:40.801]  Taiwan, not to tick off the Chinese, and the third one is the recent withdrawal of the American Army 30 miles southwest of the DMZ, and now they're talking about, in Time Magazine today, a total withdrawal.
[01:43:41.388 --> 01:43:45.431]  Yeah, they're asking North Korea, they're asking China to go ahead and invade Taiwan.
[01:43:45.451 --> 01:43:48.934]  We'll be busy off fighting in the Middle East, and that's been the plan all along.
[01:43:48.974 --> 01:43:51.736]  That's why they're abandoning Taiwan now publicly.
[01:43:51.977 --> 01:43:58.802]  The White House is changing 54 years of treaties and policy, and they call this conservative.
[01:43:58.822 --> 01:44:00.884]  Thanks for the call, Wesley.
[01:44:01.484 --> 01:44:03.606]  Let's talk to Chris in Rhode Island.
[01:44:04.575 --> 01:44:05.556]  You're on the air, Chris.
[01:44:05.596 --> 01:44:06.176]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:06.216 --> 01:44:06.557]  Go ahead.
[01:44:06.577 --> 01:44:07.537]  Hi, how are you doing?
[01:44:08.198 --> 01:44:19.165]  I just got, I moved across the country from California, and now I'm in Providence, Rhode Island, and boy, I'll have to tell you, you know, that California is like a beta test for this globalist.
[01:44:19.245 --> 01:44:19.646]  It is.
[01:44:19.986 --> 01:44:20.326]  It is.
[01:44:20.346 --> 01:44:21.407]  It's unbelievable.
[01:44:21.887 --> 01:44:28.532]  But what I want to call you is to ask you and talk to you about is I really think you need to go into this Federal Reserve situation.
[01:44:29.249 --> 01:44:31.171]  That is what I think is the linchpin.
[01:44:31.231 --> 01:44:33.312]  It's their machine, their money-making machine.
[01:44:33.332 --> 01:44:37.255]  I'll tell you what, for those that just joined us, I always like a different explanation of what it is.
[01:44:37.415 --> 01:44:41.338]  I've probably done 200 shows over the years.
[01:44:41.458 --> 01:44:45.382]  That's not enough about the banking system and how it's really a private bank and it's fiat.
[01:44:45.662 --> 01:44:48.364]  Why don't you, in a couple minutes, explain what the Federal Reserve is?
[01:44:49.004 --> 01:44:51.206]  The Federal Reserve is a private corporation.
[01:44:51.266 --> 01:44:55.870]  It's owned and controlled by foreign bankers, most notably the Rothschilds.
[01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:57.571]  The real name is Bowers, of course.
[01:44:58.365 --> 01:45:01.767]  And how the Federal Reserve Bank works, they use a 10% reserve, okay?
[01:45:01.787 --> 01:45:03.307]  It's fractional banking.
[01:45:04.068 --> 01:45:08.049]  So, in other words, they can create debt certificates with no assets behind their creation.
[01:45:08.710 --> 01:45:09.130]  Okay?
[01:45:09.150 --> 01:45:11.811]  And then they just get the okay of Congress, and they distribute it to banks.
[01:45:12.391 --> 01:45:14.952]  The banks hold 10% reserve as operating capital.
[01:45:14.972 --> 01:45:15.713]  That'd be $100,000, right?
[01:45:15.753 --> 01:45:16.793]  They loan the rest out at 10%.
[01:45:17.113 --> 01:45:20.375]  The bank then pockets $90,000 in interest and accepts back $900,000 back as a deposit.
[01:45:20.395 --> 01:45:21.635]  Therefore, the bank will retain 10%
[01:45:27.711 --> 01:45:30.152]  Yeah, they're so rich and powerful, they own the money machines.
[01:45:30.172 --> 01:45:30.612]  Let's boil it down.
[01:45:30.633 --> 01:45:31.373]  They own the money machines.
[01:45:31.393 --> 01:45:33.794]  But what's really frightening is, what is their social agenda?
[01:45:33.834 --> 01:45:34.354]  And that's
[01:45:56.002 --> 01:45:59.064]  I think to get to people's minds, you have to start with the money.
[01:45:59.684 --> 01:46:06.709]  That's the key, and you have to make it more simple than say, like, this Money Masters videos are too long, people aren't going to listen.
[01:46:06.729 --> 01:46:14.354]  You have to start with something much shorter, and you have to refute some of the propaganda, this Flaherty guy on the web, he's got a lot of propaganda.
[01:46:15.512 --> 01:46:17.414]  So you've got to stop these people.
[01:46:17.494 --> 01:46:17.954]  All right.
[01:46:18.374 --> 01:46:21.397]  Great points, and I appreciate your call, Chris.
[01:46:21.417 --> 01:46:22.998]  I'm going to have to have the other callers hold.
[01:46:23.599 --> 01:46:24.359]  I will get to you.
[01:46:24.399 --> 01:46:25.920]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:29.924]  I need to get in some more of this news.
[01:46:32.165 --> 01:46:37.630]  Callers have been mentioning what's going on with
[01:46:39.187 --> 01:47:02.723]  The China situation, I could spend an hour on this and not do it justice, but China's win to get 19-gun salute spectacular pump from the White House, President George W. Bush, may have stripped down White House protocol in keeping with a time of war, but Chinese Premier Wen Jiabu will get a spectacular treatment, according to the White House.
[01:47:02.743 --> 01:47:03.264]  That's her quote.
[01:47:04.517 --> 01:47:17.105]  Today, complete with a 19-gun salute, an official said, when we'll arrive at the presidential mansion for a South Lawn ceremony only offered during the administration to visiting heads of state, a senior administration official said.
[01:47:17.185 --> 01:47:20.848]  Then he said Bush will hold talks in the Oval Office before sitting down to lunch.
[01:47:21.108 --> 01:47:21.988]  That's going on right now.
[01:47:22.308 --> 01:47:31.254]  Some of our observers have commented that Wynne's reception will fall short according to what Clinton administration did for the last Chinese premier to visit Washington today.
[01:47:32.494 --> 01:47:33.895]  And that's a bunch of propaganda.
[01:47:34.975 --> 01:47:36.336]  Now, listen to this, folks.
[01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:38.037]  Taiwan warned by U.S.
[01:47:38.057 --> 01:47:39.137]  That's the Washington Post.
[01:47:39.218 --> 01:47:51.223]  On the eve of the Chinese premier visit, the Bush administration signaled a tougher stance toward Taiwan, moved towards independence yesterday, warning the island not to take any unilateral steps that might provoke the government on the Chinese mainland.
[01:47:51.263 --> 01:47:52.584]  They go on to abandon them.
[01:47:52.624 --> 01:47:54.125]  They won't sell them the high-tech weapons.
[01:47:54.145 --> 01:47:57.206]  They are selling China the weapons.
[01:47:57.306 --> 01:47:58.967]  It's just unspeakable.
[01:47:59.067 --> 01:48:00.468]  It's off the charts.
[01:48:01.409 --> 01:48:02.170]  It is so bad.
[01:48:02.230 --> 01:48:03.111]  Here's more news.
[01:48:03.571 --> 01:48:04.833]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[01:48:10.293 --> 01:48:20.157]  Dozens of rockets outfitted with so-called dirty bombs, warheads designed to scatter deadly radioactive material, appeared to be missing in a breakaway region of Moldavia.
[01:48:20.537 --> 01:48:38.784]  An expert said Monday, Ozu Natoi, a political analyst who works at the Non-Governmental Institute for Policy Studies, said that he had seen photocopies of Russian military documents showing that the dirty bomb warheads, 24 ready to use, 14 dismantled, were missing from a storage depot near the Trans-Denskir...
[01:48:39.404 --> 01:48:41.206]  Terespol Military Airport.
[01:48:42.207 --> 01:48:55.718]  And he said that he's a respected expert on the region of Trans-Densturb, which is populated by ethnic Slavs and has been policed by thousands of Russian troops since the region's fight for independence from Moldavia 12 years ago.
[01:48:56.058 --> 01:48:57.820]  Folks, there's no telling what the globalists are going to pull.
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:05.787]  Notice how they hyped up dirty bombs and now, oh, the Russians just accidentally, this all came up missing with all the suitcase nukes, of course, of three years ago.
[01:49:07.168 --> 01:49:07.829]  It's unbelievable.
[01:49:07.929 --> 01:49:11.372]  Voting machine makers to fight security criticism.
[01:49:11.732 --> 01:49:22.482]  Electronic voting machine companies announced yesterday that they are banding together, we already have their inside corporate documents on this from six months ago, to counter mounting concerns about whether their machines are secure enough to withstand tampering by hackers.
[01:49:22.942 --> 01:49:28.387]  They've caught the major companies going into the machines during elections with wireless internet, manipulating it, folks.
[01:49:28.407 --> 01:49:29.688]  It's not hackers, it's them.
[01:49:30.288 --> 01:49:32.971]  Although less than 20% of the nation's counties...
[01:49:33.789 --> 01:49:35.092]  Use electronic voting machines.
[01:49:35.593 --> 01:49:38.178]  Their use is growing in the wake of problems with punch cards.
[01:49:38.198 --> 01:49:39.160]  That's why they played that up.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.121]  Ballots in Florida.
[01:49:41.444 --> 01:49:43.929]  Last year, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act.
[01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:46.170]  We're good to go.
[01:50:14.834 --> 01:50:15.815]  It's a lot worse, folks.
[01:50:44.833 --> 01:50:46.174]  We're in a lot of trouble here.
[01:50:46.854 --> 01:50:49.495]  We'll come back with even more incredible news.
[01:50:49.935 --> 01:50:50.436]  Stay with me.
[01:50:53.897 --> 01:50:54.998]  Oh my!
[01:50:55.098 --> 01:50:59.820]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:03.562]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[01:51:05.143 --> 01:51:05.983]  This is Pat Cooper.
[01:51:06.003 --> 01:51:08.444]  Tony DelVecchio is coming to this station very soon.
[01:51:08.504 --> 01:51:09.065]  I'm sweet.
[01:51:09.105 --> 01:51:10.445]  I book any day now.

[01:51:13.487 --> 01:51:18.678]  That's all about this with your host, Tony DelVecchio, Saturday evenings from 9 to 10 p.m.
[01:51:18.738 --> 01:51:21.965]  Central Time, right here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:51:58.004 --> 01:52:02.410]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:06.955]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:52:06.995 --> 01:52:08.336]  The New World Order.
[01:52:09.117 --> 01:52:10.118]  Can't emerge.
[01:52:10.139 --> 01:52:14.343]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:52:14.423 --> 01:52:21.351]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:52:21.491 --> 01:52:23.474]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:23.874 --> 01:52:34.197]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:52:34.477 --> 01:52:39.819]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:55:06.222 --> 01:55:07.242]  in Iraq.
[01:55:07.622 --> 01:55:10.423]  The FBI used this guy to frame men for murders.
[01:55:10.924 --> 01:55:13.545]  They did not commit to keep the real killers free.
[01:55:13.625 --> 01:55:14.365]  Sunday Herald.
[01:55:15.174 --> 01:55:16.835]  Folks, that's just some of what's coming up.
[01:55:16.875 --> 01:55:19.236]  In fact, right now, let me talk about this story.
[01:55:19.276 --> 01:55:21.356]  Yesterday I mentioned the New York Times article.
[01:55:21.897 --> 01:55:24.357]  It's on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:55:24.658 --> 01:55:26.898]  Tough New Tactics by U.S.
[01:55:27.078 --> 01:55:30.900]  Titans Grip on Iraq Towns by Dexter Filkins.
[01:55:31.784 --> 01:55:35.827]  And it's got the colonel saying, yeah, you've got to have an ID card to go in and out of the towns.
[01:55:35.847 --> 01:55:37.508]  We put barbed wire all around the towns.
[01:55:38.148 --> 01:55:44.472]  We do capture people's women and children if we suspect them of fighting us and put them in camps.
[01:55:44.752 --> 01:55:46.253]  I mean, it's horrible, folks.
[01:55:46.813 --> 01:55:47.954]  We're wearing the black hats here.
[01:55:48.874 --> 01:55:50.135]  And here's the London Guardian.
[01:55:50.235 --> 01:55:51.176]  Israel trains U.S.
[01:55:51.216 --> 01:55:53.397]  assassination squads in Iraq today.

[01:55:56.705 --> 01:56:03.687]  special forces in aggressive counterinsurgency operations in Iraq, including the use of assassination squads against the guerrilla leaders, U.S.
[01:56:03.707 --> 01:56:05.487]  intelligence and military sources said yesterday.
[01:56:05.507 --> 01:56:10.829]  The Israeli Defense Force has sent urban warfare specialists to Fort Bragg in North Carolina, the home of the U.S.
[01:56:10.849 --> 01:56:15.190]  special forces, and according to two sources, Israeli military consultants have also visited Iraq.
[01:56:16.101 --> 01:56:16.261]  U.S.
[01:56:16.281 --> 01:56:28.490]  forces in Iraq's Sunni triangle have already begun to use tactics that echo Israeli operations in the occupied territory, sealing off centers of resistance with razor wire and raising buildings from where attacks have been launched against U.S.
[01:56:28.530 --> 01:56:28.850]  troops.
[01:56:29.130 --> 01:56:36.195]  But the secret war in Iraq is about to get much tougher in the hope of suppressing the Ba'athist-led insurgency ahead of next November's presidential elections.
[01:56:36.275 --> 01:56:37.496]  It's not Ba'athist, folks.
[01:56:38.277 --> 01:56:38.397]  U.S.
[01:56:38.417 --> 01:56:43.941]  special forces teams are already behind the lines inside Syria attempting to kill foreign jihadists before they cross the border.
[01:56:43.961 --> 01:56:45.462]  A group focused on the
[01:56:47.290 --> 01:56:51.692]  Neutralization of guerrilla leaders is being set up according to a source familiar with the operations.
[01:56:51.752 --> 01:56:54.053]  So now we've got a secret war going in Syria.
[01:56:54.433 --> 01:56:55.874]  They've already got some troops in Iran.
[01:56:55.894 --> 01:56:56.975]  I've been seeing the articles.
[01:56:57.555 --> 01:56:59.076]  There's another one, Israel aiding U.S.
[01:56:59.136 --> 01:56:59.616]  and Iraq.
[01:56:59.656 --> 01:57:04.078]  We'll talk about that, too, when we start the next hour and all the news I just mentioned and more.
[01:57:05.242 --> 01:57:15.726]  Before we do that, I do want to encourage everybody to join me this weekend in Houston, Texas at the Alamo Drafthouse Movie Theater at the West Oaks Shopping Center from 6 to midnight.
[01:57:15.746 --> 01:57:22.468]  I'm going to show Road to Tyranny, give a speech, have a question and answer, and we're going to show They Live, John Carpenter's They Live.
[01:57:22.488 --> 01:57:27.650]  It's a great place to network and meet folks, and I'll have all the videos and all the books right there if you want to get them that way.
[01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.711]  We're good to go.

[02:00:15.346 --> 02:00:16.647]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:00:17.448 --> 02:00:18.769]  More coming up in a few minutes.
[02:00:18.929 --> 02:00:19.870]  Israel trains U.S.
[02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:21.412]  assassination squads in Iraq.
[02:00:21.892 --> 02:00:26.177]  Barbed wire, ID cards, bracelets they have to wear with RFID tracker chips in them.
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:27.720]  We're going to get into that.
[02:00:51.307 --> 02:00:51.627]  U.S.
[02:00:51.667 --> 02:01:02.854]  government coming out, the new Bush administration policy, changing 54 years of policy and treaty agreements, saying we're not going to, you know, Taiwan, you better not vote for independence or defend yourself.
[02:01:03.935 --> 02:01:05.536]  Also, we'll get into the U.N.
[02:01:05.776 --> 02:01:08.958]  controlling the abortion crowd here in the United States.
[02:01:09.138 --> 02:01:10.699]  Teen generation will be the sickest.
[02:01:11.861 --> 02:01:14.424]  World's sickest adults here in the Western world.
[02:01:14.905 --> 02:01:19.070]  Joint Task Force told face-to-face blackout was a military test.
[02:01:19.591 --> 02:01:21.033]  Remember the blackout of a few months ago?
[02:01:21.834 --> 02:01:24.317]  That's now coming out as well.
[02:01:25.703 --> 02:01:26.203]  We're good to go.
[02:01:26.223 --> 02:01:26.704]  We're good to go.
[02:01:50.672 --> 02:01:55.255]  And then telling them to be subservient to a communist country such as China.
[02:01:55.335 --> 02:01:57.177]  It's totally unbelievable, Alex.
[02:01:57.777 --> 02:02:01.540]  But what I really wanted to ask you is I just finished watching your latest two movies.
[02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:06.103]  And for those out there listening that haven't seen them, haven't picked them up,
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:07.900]  They better get them.
[02:02:08.401 --> 02:02:09.341]  Alex, they're very good.
[02:02:09.541 --> 02:02:10.761]  What videos?
[02:02:10.861 --> 02:02:12.722]  Matrix of Evil and Police State 3?
[02:02:12.862 --> 02:02:14.683]  Yeah, I watched both of those last night.
[02:02:15.203 --> 02:02:18.904]  I really like both of them, but I like the Matrix of Evil better.
[02:02:19.224 --> 02:02:24.606]  I like your interview with Congressman McKinney from California.
[02:02:25.166 --> 02:02:27.187]  We were in California, but she was from Georgia.
[02:02:27.407 --> 02:02:27.907]  Okay.
[02:02:28.408 --> 02:02:31.749]  And I also, of course, the spot with Ron Paul on there.
[02:02:32.833 --> 02:02:38.278]  Your speech is in there with Ron Paul there at that one meeting.
[02:02:38.298 --> 02:02:46.164]  And, of course, your talk there in front of the council people in Austin, your 15 minutes, very moving, very good.
[02:02:46.585 --> 02:02:48.066]  What I wanted to ask you is this, Alex.
[02:02:49.299 --> 02:02:50.599]  I believe it was in Police State 3.
[02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:56.424]  You're shown questioning then-Governor Bush and them leading you out.
[02:02:56.464 --> 02:03:01.327]  And then the caption on the bottom says, Alex Jones being arrested for questioning Governor Bush.
[02:03:01.707 --> 02:03:04.489]  Now, were you actually arrested, or did they just lead you out?
[02:03:04.689 --> 02:03:07.091]  I was kidnapped.
[02:03:07.511 --> 02:03:08.352]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:03:08.372 --> 02:03:11.694]  When we come back in the next break, I'll answer that question fully and tell the story.
[02:03:11.734 --> 02:03:15.417]  But I was kidnapped for about an hour before.
[02:03:16.911 --> 02:03:18.892]  By Bush's people.
[02:03:20.052 --> 02:03:36.936]  Just like, remember when Charles Keyes tried, he was on the list to be in the 96 debates, and then when he went there for the debate, they decided he wasn't going to be allowed there, so they kidnapped him and drove him around for two hours and threw him out by a basketball court in a crack neighborhood.
[02:03:38.276 --> 02:03:43.817]  They threw the former ambassador out in a dangerous neighborhood, drove him an hour plus away and threw him out of the car.
[02:03:44.418 --> 02:03:45.778]  Well, I have the same thing happen to me.
[02:03:47.153 --> 02:03:47.973]  To answer your question.
[02:03:48.073 --> 02:03:50.534]  Okay, so they didn't actually arrest you, they just kidnapped you?
[02:03:50.654 --> 02:03:53.454]  Well, I mean, sir, when they pull you over, you're under arrest.
[02:03:54.114 --> 02:03:55.815]  Yes, yes, I was arrested.
[02:03:56.135 --> 02:03:57.535]  They told me you were under arrest.
[02:03:59.115 --> 02:04:01.116]  They put me in handcuffs outside.
[02:04:01.496 --> 02:04:02.376]  They put me in a car.
[02:04:02.416 --> 02:04:05.857]  They drove me around for about an hour and then threw me out on the side of the highway.
[02:04:06.497 --> 02:04:08.797]  But they didn't formally charge you so you had to go to court?
[02:04:09.197 --> 02:04:10.998]  No, but they told me you were under arrest.
[02:04:11.018 --> 02:04:11.938]  That's unbelievable.
[02:04:12.619 --> 02:04:18.995]  Okay, my other question is, since you were talking to Larry Pratt earlier, whatever happened to Bob Stewart?
[02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.290]  You know what?
[02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:21.311]  I can answer that question, too.
[02:04:21.371 --> 02:04:21.931]  Stay there, Brad.
[02:04:21.951 --> 02:04:30.435]  We'll come back, and I'll go into the Bush story from 1998, and that is in Matrix, not Matrix of Evil, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[02:04:30.715 --> 02:04:32.135]  And thanks for getting the videos, Brad.
[02:04:32.155 --> 02:04:32.516]  Stay there.
[02:04:32.756 --> 02:04:39.199]  I hope you'll make copies for Christmas and give them out to folks, because that's why I make the films, and I want to thank those that have gotten the films.
[02:04:39.479 --> 02:04:44.421]  We'll be back with Brad and Spencer and Micah and Jay and others.
[02:04:46.024 --> 02:04:50.349]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:54.953]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:55.134 --> 02:04:59.498]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.

[02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:02.001]  Can emerge.
[02:05:02.682 --> 02:05:06.886]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:06.966 --> 02:05:13.894]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.

[02:08:04.119 --> 02:08:10.243]  And, of course, Matrix of Evil, and he was talking about at the end of Police State 3.
[02:08:13.145 --> 02:08:15.107]  Well, let's bring Brad back up on the show.
[02:08:15.327 --> 02:08:18.029]  For those that haven't seen it, was I rude to Bush?
[02:08:18.409 --> 02:08:19.530]  Was I confrontational?
[02:08:19.690 --> 02:08:20.851]  What did you see on the video?
[02:08:21.311 --> 02:08:22.352]  No, not at all.
[02:08:22.412 --> 02:08:23.192]  You just stood up.
[02:08:23.713 --> 02:08:25.114]  He was speaking in front of...
[02:08:26.124 --> 02:08:32.526]  Some people, I imagine there was other press people there, and you stood up as a press person to ask questions, and you asked him some questions that he didn't like.
[02:08:32.606 --> 02:08:35.326]  I mean, he had a totally stunned look on his face.
[02:08:35.446 --> 02:08:40.067]  I'll ask you about, it was the end of his speech, because they put out the prepared speech.
[02:08:40.127 --> 02:08:42.508]  They had put it out on the state website.
[02:08:43.408 --> 02:08:44.809]  He was supposed to take questions.
[02:08:44.849 --> 02:08:49.350]  There was tons of press there, probably about 500 people at the DuPont photo masking plant in 1998.
[02:08:51.398 --> 02:08:52.659]  I think we're good to go.
[02:09:21.542 --> 02:09:21.942]  We're good to go.
[02:09:21.962 --> 02:09:22.123]  I think?
[02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:44.351]  That's who his protection detail was.
[02:09:44.852 --> 02:09:45.772]  Shaved head guys.
[02:09:45.792 --> 02:09:46.893]  Drug out.
[02:09:46.933 --> 02:09:48.094]  They almost broke my arm.
[02:09:48.134 --> 02:09:49.095]  Gave me the constables.
[02:09:49.115 --> 02:09:50.316]  It's on video.
[02:09:50.336 --> 02:09:51.477]  What are we going to charge him with?
[02:09:51.958 --> 02:09:53.419]  They slammed me into the wall.
[02:09:54.159 --> 02:09:56.441]  And then they said, you're under arrest, boy.
[02:09:56.461 --> 02:09:57.242]  You're in deep trouble.
[02:09:57.602 --> 02:09:58.643]  They put me in a car.
[02:09:58.763 --> 02:10:04.128]  And about five minutes down the road, the radio comes on and goes, go to your cell phone.
[02:10:04.528 --> 02:10:06.210]  The governor's got a plan.
[02:10:07.316 --> 02:10:12.258]  And they're driving me along, and the guy gets on his cell phone, and he goes, okay, okay, release him.
[02:10:12.918 --> 02:10:13.939]  Okay, drive him around.
[02:10:13.959 --> 02:10:14.699]  The guy's talking.
[02:10:14.719 --> 02:10:14.899]  I'm here.
[02:10:14.939 --> 02:10:15.579]  Okay, yes, sir.
[02:10:15.619 --> 02:10:15.999]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:17.800]  Okay, governor's orders.
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:18.400]  Yes, yes.
[02:10:19.041 --> 02:10:35.447]  And so he drives me around for, I guess, about 50 minutes or so, takes me to the county line of Williamson County and Travis County, and just pulls off the highway and puts me out on the side of the road.
[02:10:36.414 --> 02:10:37.995]  And my cell phone's in my truck.
[02:10:38.135 --> 02:10:40.136]  My camera guy's back there at the scene.
[02:10:40.937 --> 02:10:42.138]  Luckily, he had a cell phone.
[02:10:42.638 --> 02:10:48.121]  I went and called and got a ride to the local radio station that's in North Austin that was the closest area.
[02:10:48.141 --> 02:10:51.163]  I had somebody pick me up, drove me back out to get my truck.
[02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:53.905]  But that's the new America.
[02:10:53.985 --> 02:10:59.509]  And again, Charles Keyes, in 1996, the former U.N.
[02:10:59.549 --> 02:11:03.111]  ambassador, the talk show host, the Christian Coalition guy,
[02:11:04.192 --> 02:11:06.793]  He was on the list of the Republican debate.
[02:11:08.554 --> 02:11:11.495]  And he was showing nicely in the polls in New Hampshire and other areas.
[02:11:11.515 --> 02:11:15.137]  He was the tail runner, but he was moving forward in the polls.
[02:11:15.817 --> 02:11:18.698]  He shows up that night and they announce he will not be allowed to be in the debate.
[02:11:18.838 --> 02:11:20.599]  The Republicans have decided.
[02:11:21.449 --> 02:11:22.950]  And he was kidnapped.
[02:11:22.990 --> 02:11:23.770]  That's what he called it.
[02:11:23.850 --> 02:11:34.957]  So was I. Put in a car, driven around for about an hour and 45 minutes, thrown out on the other side of town at a basketball court, literally in a crack neighborhood, thrown out there on the side of the road.
[02:11:35.537 --> 02:11:36.798]  And that's the tactic.
[02:11:36.838 --> 02:11:37.918]  That's what they do.
[02:11:37.978 --> 02:11:41.940]  They will kidnap you and throw you out on the side of the highway.
[02:11:43.001 --> 02:11:44.062]  Now, you saw the video.
[02:11:44.102 --> 02:11:44.802]  What did you think of it?
[02:11:45.222 --> 02:11:46.423]  I thought the videos were great.
[02:11:46.483 --> 02:11:48.244]  And I'm telling you, my wife...
[02:11:48.965 --> 02:11:59.491]  At the end of Police Day 3, she made me replay numerous times the part about Building 7 on the WTC imploding straight down with Dan Rather.
[02:11:59.531 --> 02:12:00.612]  She could not believe it.
[02:12:00.632 --> 02:12:01.592]  I've been telling her about it.
[02:12:01.632 --> 02:12:03.834]  And Dan Rather goes, looks like well-placed dynamite.
[02:12:03.874 --> 02:12:13.939]  Yes, and you know, Alex, when you talk to people about the WTC, if you ask them how many buildings were involved in it, you almost always get the answer, well, two.
[02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:14.700]  Well, two.
[02:12:15.231 --> 02:12:28.141]  But there were seven buildings in that complex, and nobody knows about this building seven, 47 stories that collapsed the same way, what was it, about four hours after the two towers fell down, four or six hours after?
[02:12:28.561 --> 02:12:30.702]  I mean, absolutely incredible.
[02:12:31.463 --> 02:12:35.446]  And again, that's about a minute and a half of the two-hour, 40-minute film.
[02:12:35.946 --> 02:12:36.487]  Yeah, right.
[02:12:36.627 --> 02:12:38.608]  The Bush kidnapping is about two minutes.
[02:12:38.688 --> 02:12:40.670]  I mean, it's all, the films, folks...
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:45.641]  Just hours and hours of continual information.
[02:12:45.661 --> 02:12:46.842]  They're totally jam-packed.
[02:12:49.364 --> 02:12:50.404]  Very good stuff.
[02:12:50.524 --> 02:12:52.526]  Can you answer real quick, and I'll get off to the other caller.
[02:12:52.546 --> 02:12:52.726]  Sure.
[02:12:52.766 --> 02:12:53.386]  Bob Stewart.
[02:12:53.746 --> 02:12:55.027]  Yes, thanks for reminding me.
[02:12:55.047 --> 02:12:55.927]  I know there was another question.
[02:12:56.288 --> 02:13:02.611]  Bob Stewart, Monty Griffin, bolt-action, single-shot, .50 cal rifle, never been a crime committed in the U.S.
[02:13:02.631 --> 02:13:04.753]  with a semi-automatic, I mean with a single shot.
[02:13:05.033 --> 02:13:08.435]  One crime committed with a semi-automatic, an armored car robbery.
[02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:19.993]  And Bob Stewart, you know, making these guns, his own little factory, busted, charged, and then he defeated that.
[02:13:20.033 --> 02:13:24.319]  It was thrown out of court, and then he was charged with threatening the judge from prison.
[02:13:24.419 --> 02:13:27.183]  A convicted felon testified against him.
[02:13:28.038 --> 02:13:32.264]  And he's now been given 20, what is it, 23 years in federal prison.
[02:13:32.284 --> 02:13:36.610]  He will spend at least 21 years of the 20-plus year sentence.
[02:13:36.630 --> 02:13:39.334]  You serve about 95% of a federal sentence.
[02:13:39.894 --> 02:13:44.561]  And the man has just been totally railroaded and happens to gun dealers and gun manufacturers.
[02:13:44.981 --> 02:13:45.542]  We're good to go.
[02:14:05.405 --> 02:14:06.026]  Thanks for the call.
[02:14:06.086 --> 02:14:06.666]  That's horrible.
[02:14:06.726 --> 02:14:07.046]  Thank you.
[02:14:07.266 --> 02:14:07.907]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:14:08.087 --> 02:14:10.068]  And let me just right now cover this.
[02:14:10.268 --> 02:14:12.009]  Now, again, I have this from Texas.
[02:14:12.089 --> 02:14:13.110]  I have this from New York.
[02:14:13.490 --> 02:14:14.471]  I have this from Boston.
[02:14:14.531 --> 02:14:15.471]  I have this from L.A.
[02:14:15.571 --> 02:14:17.733]  I have these articles from Denver, Colorado.
[02:14:17.813 --> 02:14:19.494]  I have these articles from Kansas City.
[02:14:19.914 --> 02:14:21.475]  I have these articles from Miami.
[02:14:21.575 --> 02:14:23.897]  I have articles like this every week.
[02:14:25.918 --> 02:14:28.580]  And I've gotten to the point where I've become desensitized to it.
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:29.380]  I don't even cover it.
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:30.781]  But talking about framing people...
[02:14:33.010 --> 02:14:35.691]  They just claim that you threatened somebody and you're gone, folks.
[02:14:35.711 --> 02:14:40.852]  That's why you've got to espouse and be honest about it, nonviolence, because they want to blame people with this.
[02:14:41.452 --> 02:14:44.113]  The FBI used this guy to frame men for murders.
[02:14:44.413 --> 02:14:46.794]  They did not commit to keep the real killers free.
[02:14:46.814 --> 02:14:48.634]  Thirty years later, the cover-up goes on.
[02:14:48.654 --> 02:14:49.154]  The idea of four...
[02:14:51.750 --> 02:15:04.799]  Innocent men going to prison for life for a murder they didn't commit is horrifying enough by any standard, but the fact that the Boston FBI agents knew of their innocence, set up the conviction, and allowed the injustice to roll on for more than 30 years has horrified America.
[02:15:04.819 --> 02:15:11.183]  It was part of a long-running FBI scheme to protect top-secret informants who frighteningly were murderers themselves.
[02:15:11.683 --> 02:15:15.506]  It has now been revealed the FBI was getting money for murder for hire, folks.
[02:15:15.546 --> 02:15:16.467]  They are the mob.
[02:15:16.487 --> 02:15:20.689]  Remember the head of the FBI saying there's no La Cosa Nostra in 54?
[02:15:21.950 --> 02:15:23.531]  I mean, that's like saying there's no moon.
[02:15:24.431 --> 02:15:32.053]  Two of the men wrongly accused in 1965 of killing a small-time Boston crook, Teddy Deegan, died in jail.
[02:15:32.093 --> 02:15:39.996]  The other two were finally released, Joseph Salvetti, after 30 years in jail, and Peter Lamone after 33 years of incarceration.
[02:15:40.456 --> 02:15:57.381]  Now the FBI has been accused by a powerful congressional committee of causing incalculable damage to the public by protecting the deadly informants over a period of 38 years in a report running to 141 pages entitled Everything Secret Degenerates the FBI's Use of Murderers as Informants.
[02:15:57.781 --> 02:16:05.923]  The House Committee on Government Reform has branded the FBI's behavior as one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement.
[02:16:05.983 --> 02:16:06.183]  Okay.
[02:16:07.549 --> 02:16:13.975]  Folks, let me just give you a few examples that I gave before the city council in Matrix of Evil here in Austin before they threw the Patriot Act out.
[02:16:15.477 --> 02:16:25.847]  Number one, Tulia, Texas, 56 black Americans, none of them even had a criminal record, no drugs, no drug paraphernalia found.
[02:16:26.898 --> 02:16:40.687]  A cop who was paid, doubling as an informant in other counties, would be paid about $1,000 to $1,200, depending on what article I've seen in the Associated Press, per person who was convicted.
[02:16:42.068 --> 02:16:42.908]  He would go around.
[02:16:42.928 --> 02:16:49.813]  56 black people, no criminal records, no drugs were found, were given between minimum sentences of 20 years to 90 years.
[02:16:52.719 --> 02:16:54.140]  That was to Leah, Texas.
[02:16:54.701 --> 02:16:56.863]  Later, he went out with some other people and framed them.
[02:16:56.903 --> 02:17:00.146]  He got caught, admitted it, and the governor had to pardon him.
[02:17:00.186 --> 02:17:02.028]  The courts wouldn't even let these people go.
[02:17:03.049 --> 02:17:09.115]  About three months ago, the Houston Chronicle headline, police chief goes public about frame-ups.
[02:17:09.675 --> 02:17:18.404]  Thousands, upwards of 2,000 people framed by the Houston Crime Lab with DNA, hair evidence, fibers, you name it.
[02:17:19.582 --> 02:17:20.102]  We're good to go.
[02:17:20.122 --> 02:17:20.563]  I think?
[02:17:38.977 --> 02:17:42.359]  And J. Edgar Hoover said there was no La Cosa Nostra.
[02:17:42.399 --> 02:17:44.900]  Folks, he ran the mob for the big banks.
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:54.365]  When you hear about the Italian mob or the Jewish mob or the Irish mob, that's nothing compared to the real powerful WASP mob that runs all these people.
[02:17:54.385 --> 02:17:59.867]  Nobody ever hears about the German mafia that has been the most powerful thing in Texas for 100 years.
[02:18:02.106 --> 02:18:10.214]  But again, these big, powerful mafias, they're the judges, they're the governors, they run the drugs, they run the whores, they run it all, folks!
[02:18:10.774 --> 02:18:12.896]  They run the cocaine, the heroin.
[02:18:12.916 --> 02:18:19.542]  A lot of your counties have former FBI agents or BATF as their sheriffs or chiefs of police now.
[02:18:20.323 --> 02:18:24.547]  We have evidence that almost everyone we investigate is dealing masses of narcotics.
[02:18:25.194 --> 02:18:27.215]  Their own SWAT team is on the take.
[02:18:27.255 --> 02:18:30.317]  They'll raid your house if they think there's some marijuana.
[02:18:30.357 --> 02:18:31.817]  But, I mean, it's a sick joke.
[02:18:32.458 --> 02:18:41.922]  The people that they deal the drugs to, every few months will give them somebody they sold drugs to and they'll go bust them to pack the prisons and seize houses and cars.
[02:18:42.202 --> 02:18:44.423]  So they sell the drugs, then raid the people.
[02:18:44.824 --> 02:18:47.665]  Some of the people they're selling is another form of taxation.
[02:18:48.525 --> 02:18:49.766]  And it happened to Bob Stewart.
[02:18:50.370 --> 02:18:55.754]  Dr. Charles Sell, the Army doctor, called into Waco to do medical records, said they killed those people.
[02:18:55.795 --> 02:18:56.915]  He was there during the siege.
[02:18:57.196 --> 02:19:00.298]  They grab him, say he's mentally ill, claim it a shooting range.
[02:19:00.879 --> 02:19:02.480]  He threatened to go out for the FBI.
[02:19:02.820 --> 02:19:03.181]  Boom.
[02:19:03.261 --> 02:19:06.503]  Forced drugging for six years, five of it in solitary confinement.
[02:19:08.525 --> 02:19:11.207]  They're not even giving him a trial.
[02:19:11.307 --> 02:19:13.349]  I mean, we're the Soviet Union now.
[02:19:14.770 --> 02:19:19.794]  And so this is the FBI that wants national DNA databases for people who aren't criminals.
[02:19:20.314 --> 02:19:24.618]  This is the FBI that wants face-scanning cameras and cameras in the classrooms and the bathrooms.
[02:19:24.918 --> 02:19:28.421]  This is the FBI that wants the states to thumb-scan you to get a driver's license.
[02:19:28.641 --> 02:19:33.925]  This is the FBI that wants to secretly arrest you for any misdemeanor under Patriot Act 1, Section 802.
[02:19:34.586 --> 02:19:35.867]  They cannot be trusted.
[02:19:35.967 --> 02:19:37.428]  Do you understand me?
[02:19:39.610 --> 02:19:41.851]  We'll come back, cover more news, get to more calls.
[02:19:41.951 --> 02:19:42.992]  Everybody just stay there.
[02:19:43.012 --> 02:19:43.753]  We're going to get to you.
[02:19:46.098 --> 02:19:47.419]  Hey, Doris, great news!
[02:19:47.659 --> 02:19:51.923]  I now own my own home, free and clear, and I did it in less than five months.
[02:19:52.023 --> 02:19:53.384]  Did you receive an inheritance?
[02:19:53.564 --> 02:19:54.025]  Well, no.
[02:19:54.185 --> 02:19:58.889]  Actually, I found a way to eliminate my mortgage without bankruptcy and without the need of going to court.
[02:19:59.029 --> 02:20:02.272]  And you, too, can do this legally, lawfully, ethically, and morally.
[02:20:02.352 --> 02:20:04.794]  But, Jim, I signed a note promising to pay back the loan.
[02:20:04.934 --> 02:20:06.916]  Isn't it wrong even if I could discharge the loan?
[02:20:07.176 --> 02:20:12.019]  Doris, I felt the same way until I took the time to learn the truth about money and banking.
[02:20:12.139 --> 02:20:16.022]  The most shocking thing I learned is the fact that no real money is ever loaned out.
[02:20:16.162 --> 02:20:18.844]  There's a dirty secret that the banks don't want you to know.
[02:20:19.024 --> 02:20:22.607]  And this is the basis of how I was able to discharge my own mortgage.
[02:20:22.787 --> 02:20:25.709]  I know this is hard to believe, but go to the website to learn more.
[02:20:25.849 --> 02:20:33.214]  Doris, get your pin and find out how many Americans are finding financial freedom by having their mortgages eliminated in less than five months.
[02:20:33.434 --> 02:20:38.057]  Go to www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[02:20:38.197 --> 02:20:40.619]  Just the way it sounds, and there's an S after mortgage.
[02:20:40.799 --> 02:20:45.522]  It's www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[02:20:45.902 --> 02:20:50.145]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[02:20:50.635 --> 02:20:51.295]  We're good to go.
[02:21:09.406 --> 02:21:10.046]  We're good to go.
[02:21:39.071 --> 02:21:39.712]  Do it today.
[02:21:40.052 --> 02:21:40.812]  The number 800-686-2237.
[02:21:40.872 --> 02:21:52.941]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:21:53.161 --> 02:21:55.403]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:21:55.603 --> 02:22:01.948]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:22:02.301 --> 02:22:02.941]  We're good to go.
[02:22:24.910 --> 02:22:25.831]  We're good to go.
[02:22:44.696 --> 02:22:50.938]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:22:51.078 --> 02:22:57.220]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:05.942]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:23:06.202 --> 02:23:13.224]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:23:13.524 --> 02:23:13.964]  We're good to go.
[02:23:13.984 --> 02:23:14.444]  We're good to go.
[02:23:47.473 --> 02:23:52.615]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:53.296 --> 02:23:55.637]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:23:58.519 --> 02:23:59.219]  All right, folks.
[02:23:59.679 --> 02:24:01.860]  Let's go back to some of your calls.
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:07.203]  Then I'll get into all the other news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:24:07.223 --> 02:24:10.065]  And a recap of top stories that are all very, very important.
[02:24:10.765 --> 02:24:12.766]  Let's talk to Micah in Washington, D.C.
[02:24:12.786 --> 02:24:13.746]  Been patiently holding.
[02:24:13.786 --> 02:24:14.587]  Thanks for the call, Micah.
[02:24:15.794 --> 02:24:16.694]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:24:16.814 --> 02:24:17.715]  Fantastic, sir.
[02:24:18.495 --> 02:24:22.557]  First of all, I just want to say that you're an excellent researcher and very informed.
[02:24:23.418 --> 02:24:26.299]  And I remember something you said from a previous show.
[02:24:26.319 --> 02:24:31.881]  You said something to the effect of, if it can't be proved, you know, I don't want to believe in it.
[02:24:31.941 --> 02:24:35.483]  I just tend to brush it aside as a random theory.
[02:24:36.243 --> 02:24:39.825]  Now, about the alien theory, okay?
[02:24:40.345 --> 02:24:43.967]  The theory that there is an extraterrestrial race that is taking advantage of us.
[02:24:44.818 --> 02:24:49.799]  That is a theory that I believe could be proven and has been to an extent.
[02:24:50.499 --> 02:24:52.700]  I wonder why you don't see that as valid, though.
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:54.620]  Well, let me see.
[02:24:55.221 --> 02:24:57.261]  I have a London Guardian article where the U.S.
[02:24:57.301 --> 02:25:01.842]  government admits they can implant false memories in us.
[02:25:02.142 --> 02:25:04.023]  Let me finish, since you asked a question.
[02:25:04.143 --> 02:25:04.503]  I have a...
[02:25:05.795 --> 02:25:10.921]  New York Times article where they admit that there is a hum going on in many cities making people sick.
[02:25:10.961 --> 02:25:12.643]  We know they have ultra-low frequency weapons.
[02:25:13.003 --> 02:25:17.668]  The Boston Globe a few months ago admitted that DARPA is going to deploy these on cell towers.
[02:25:17.708 --> 02:25:24.916]  What we'd already known, but I wouldn't talk about because it's too crazy sounding, is now in the New York Times and in Senate legislation.
[02:25:24.936 --> 02:25:26.017]  Right.
[02:25:27.060 --> 02:25:29.922]  It's hard enough for folks to believe they're building concentration camps.
[02:25:30.002 --> 02:25:31.362]  That's in the New York Times today.
[02:25:31.402 --> 02:25:33.443]  I'm going to recap that later in the next segment.
[02:25:33.463 --> 02:25:35.504]  Of course, it's for your safety, they say.
[02:25:35.524 --> 02:25:40.127]  It's hard enough to believe General Eberhardt out of Colorado Springs is saying this.
[02:25:40.847 --> 02:25:42.348]  Now martial law is a wonderful thing.
[02:25:43.008 --> 02:25:45.689]  Well, sir, it doesn't matter if it's hard to believe or not.
[02:25:45.749 --> 02:25:51.252]  Well, my point is, I have them saying it, I have the bills, and I know there's a U.S.
[02:25:51.272 --> 02:25:58.316]  government plan that we have in the book Order Out of Chaos, Paul Watson's great research, that exposes that the Air Force and the U.S.
[02:25:58.356 --> 02:25:58.816]  government
[02:25:59.456 --> 02:26:18.761]  I have even told Spielberg to go put out these films, that Fox puts this out, the sci-fi channels run by a Rothschild, that's the Kansas City star in New York Times, and so we go over all this, and they're creating this, and a lot of their secret ops are really covers for secret government technologies.
[02:26:19.401 --> 02:26:21.261]  Okay, well, let me ask you this.
[02:26:21.801 --> 02:26:25.042]  If that's the case, my contention is that
[02:26:25.515 --> 02:26:30.619]  Most of this is alien technology that has influxed through our military-industrial complex.
[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:41.048]  But my question to you is, if this is just all a ruse, how do you account for these extreme and extraordinary, amazing changes that have taken place in such a small amount of time?
[02:26:42.789 --> 02:26:46.272]  Well, again, what happens on this show is...
[02:26:52.806 --> 02:26:59.992]  Aren't jumping around off the Alpha Centauri's gas cluster.
[02:27:00.752 --> 02:27:03.274]  I mean, how do I know that the world isn't really flat?
[02:27:03.815 --> 02:27:05.716]  I'm not saying there aren't space aliens.
[02:27:05.776 --> 02:27:06.977]  I'm not saying.
[02:27:07.017 --> 02:27:12.161]  But look, the establishment puts somebody talking about UFOs on 500 radio stations.
[02:27:12.441 --> 02:27:13.762]  They want you to think about that.
[02:27:13.782 --> 02:27:14.963]  They want you to talk about that.
[02:27:15.203 --> 02:27:27.514]  They don't want you talking about the Federal Reserve or race-specific bioweapons that can kill whole races of people and how the PNAC document in 2000, Dick Cheney calls for getting the public to accept killing certain races.
[02:27:27.774 --> 02:27:28.995]  Why isn't that big news?
[02:27:29.396 --> 02:27:37.423]  Well, listen, this is my point, is that that is all extraordinarily important, and it all ties in together because there's an infrastructure, a power hierarchy,
[02:27:38.484 --> 02:27:39.924]  Yes, there is a secret government.
[02:27:40.084 --> 02:27:43.346]  There is 35 years at least of suppressed technology.
[02:27:43.907 --> 02:27:53.292]  We are in a false reality of older technology with the elite arrogantly that have built spires of higher technological development, and we are being dehumanized.
[02:27:53.332 --> 02:27:56.614]  They do plan to kill 80 to 95 percent of us, their own statements.
[02:27:56.874 --> 02:28:00.456]  But see, that sounds nuts, and I can prove it, so I'll say it.
[02:28:00.976 --> 02:28:05.877]  But I cannot prove it's Little Green Man, and I will not, I mean, you're not censored.
[02:28:05.917 --> 02:28:07.578]  Anybody can call in here, do whatever they want.
[02:28:07.738 --> 02:28:09.198]  We're one of the few shows that doesn't do that.
[02:28:09.518 --> 02:28:11.599]  You're welcome to call in with whatever your topic is.
[02:28:11.639 --> 02:28:21.121]  And you know, another thing I wanted to say, you're extremely, extremely polite to your callers, and you're one of the very, very few talk show hosts that is.
[02:28:21.181 --> 02:28:22.141]  That's amazing to me.
[02:28:24.395 --> 02:28:26.956]  Well, look, we just try to do the best job we can.
[02:28:27.056 --> 02:28:34.497]  I mean, all I'm saying is I can't touch it, feel it, taste it, smell it, so I don't get into little green man.
[02:28:34.557 --> 02:28:37.758]  You should research what happens to these eyewitnesses.
[02:28:37.858 --> 02:28:38.738]  I have researched it.
[02:28:39.518 --> 02:28:43.839]  It's the same government conspiracy stuff that happens to other people like you were talking about.
[02:28:44.399 --> 02:28:47.400]  Kidnapping and trying to hide them, pushing them under rugs.
[02:28:47.620 --> 02:28:48.900]  It's the same thing that they do.
[02:28:49.401 --> 02:28:51.581]  It also happens to the people that are eyewitnesses too.
[02:28:52.111 --> 02:29:01.978]  Well, look, we're a tiny blue jewel orbiting a standard sun two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
[02:29:02.959 --> 02:29:07.703]  And, you know, the Bible talks about the Nephilim and genetic engineering.
[02:29:08.023 --> 02:29:09.004]  I know all that, sir.
[02:29:09.084 --> 02:29:11.606]  It's just I only stick to stuff I can prove.
[02:29:11.906 --> 02:29:15.469]  People have enough trouble admitting stuff when it's documented.
[02:29:16.729 --> 02:29:17.750]  Well, you know what?
[02:29:17.790 --> 02:29:21.193]  You're an excellent mind, and I can say that
[02:29:22.468 --> 02:29:26.052]  You will come to the bottom of this, as I am trying to do as well.
[02:29:27.374 --> 02:29:28.655]  Okay, hey, good to hear from you.
[02:29:28.675 --> 02:29:29.496]  Thanks for the compliments.
[02:29:29.836 --> 02:29:30.797]  You're a great caller, too.
[02:29:31.518 --> 02:29:35.562]  We'll come back and go to Jay and Ed and Spencer and John.
[02:29:36.543 --> 02:29:37.444]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.944 --> 02:29:39.546]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.467 --> 02:29:43.170]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:52.592]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[02:29:52.972 --> 02:29:57.054]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[02:29:57.554 --> 02:30:04.777]  Only recently has science discovered that maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[02:30:05.317 --> 02:30:05.918]  We're good to go.
[02:30:22.637 --> 02:30:23.017]  Late summer 2003.
[02:30:49.977 --> 02:30:51.417]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[02:31:24.315 --> 02:31:24.896]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[02:31:24.916 --> 02:31:25.116]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:31:46.203 --> 02:31:49.086]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[02:31:49.106 --> 02:31:51.109]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[02:31:51.289 --> 02:31:56.916]  CheaperHotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCar.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.
[02:31:56.996 --> 02:32:02.784]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.
[02:32:02.904 --> 02:32:05.345]  Well, I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.
[02:32:05.945 --> 02:32:18.348]  www.vacationa2z.com A membership in vacationa2z.com will not only land you huge savings on air and hotel, you'll be treated to discounts of 10-80% on car rentals, golf, movies and theme parks.
[02:32:18.548 --> 02:32:22.830]  How about free food at restaurants or big discounts on ski packages at top ski resorts?
[02:32:23.050 --> 02:32:23.750]  Not convinced yet?
[02:32:23.890 --> 02:32:27.591]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[02:32:27.671 --> 02:32:28.491]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:28.511 --> 02:32:29.732]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:32:57.481 --> 02:32:59.262]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:59.883 --> 02:33:02.225]  Crashing the lives of disinformation.
[02:33:03.205 --> 02:33:05.127]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:33:05.667 --> 02:33:06.748]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[02:33:06.808 --> 02:33:12.312]  Going out on the AM and FM dial from Los Angeles to Providence Road Island.
[02:33:12.472 --> 02:33:17.195]  Simulcasting on the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:17.656 --> 02:33:19.937]  And global shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20.
[02:33:20.037 --> 02:33:21.218]  And at night 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[02:33:27.719 --> 02:33:34.604]  We're about to go back to Jay and Ed and John and Leslie and Spencer and others.
[02:33:36.285 --> 02:33:37.346]  And that'll be it for calls.
[02:33:37.366 --> 02:33:42.449]  Those five callers is all I have time to get to because I want to go into some of the news we have not gotten to yet.
[02:33:42.489 --> 02:33:55.098]  But going back to the FBI, all over the country framing, killing people, running hit teams, sending innocent people to prison, people who politically were fighting against their corruption.
[02:33:55.158 --> 02:33:56.259]  It's come out in Boston.
[02:33:58.826 --> 02:34:01.488]  We've only found the tip of the iceberg, and it's prolific.
[02:34:01.988 --> 02:34:06.511]  So how can you trust them for their new DNA database they're about to pass in Congress?
[02:34:07.752 --> 02:34:09.534]  For everyone, people who aren't criminals.
[02:34:10.874 --> 02:34:14.377]  Again, how do you trust the big monolithic structure of government?
[02:34:14.637 --> 02:34:17.299]  Because it can mete out more abuse than any other institution.
[02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:20.521]  How can you trust them to surveil and run your life?
[02:34:20.581 --> 02:34:22.162]  And, oh, you don't have anything to hide.
[02:34:23.183 --> 02:34:24.344]  You don't have any privacy.
[02:34:24.404 --> 02:34:27.346]  But they want total privacy, total secrecy.
[02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:30.081]  It's scary, folks.
[02:34:30.161 --> 02:34:33.582]  We're in a very scary time right now in America.
[02:34:34.222 --> 02:34:38.904]  In the world, tyranny is upon us, but people are waking up, are speaking out against it.
[02:34:41.365 --> 02:34:56.331]  Before I go back to these calls real quick and to the news, if you live in Texas, Louisiana, if you live in New Mexico, you live in, oh, you name it, up in Arkansas or Oklahoma or anywhere in South Texas, you don't have an excuse.
[02:34:56.451 --> 02:34:57.792]  I hope to see everybody
[02:34:59.665 --> 02:35:06.796]  Who wants to network and meet like-minded people and see 9-11 Road to Tyranny and John Carpenter's They Live?
[02:35:07.688 --> 02:35:17.852]  I hope to see you all in Houston, Texas this Saturday from 6 to midnight for a Police State double feature with my documentary and then, of course, the Hollywood production of They Live.
[02:35:17.872 --> 02:35:19.292]  We're going to show Road to Tyranny.
[02:35:19.312 --> 02:35:20.272]  I'm going to give a 30-minute speech.
[02:35:20.292 --> 02:35:21.293]  We're going to take questions.
[02:35:21.313 --> 02:35:23.494]  Then we're going to show They Live.
[02:35:23.514 --> 02:35:30.796]  They've got food, drinks, everything at the Alamo Draft House, West Oaks Shopping Center in Houston, Texas.
[02:35:31.176 --> 02:35:33.277]  And there's a map to it at Infowars.com.
[02:35:33.317 --> 02:35:35.798]  You can link through to the website of the movie theater.
[02:35:38.053 --> 02:35:41.315]  And you can buy your ticket there.
[02:35:59.828 --> 02:36:00.949]  And then come on in.
[02:36:00.969 --> 02:36:01.829]  We'll have the videos.
[02:36:01.849 --> 02:36:02.429]  We'll have the books.
[02:36:02.509 --> 02:36:03.289]  It'll all be available.
[02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:04.630]  I'll give a 30-minute speech.
[02:36:04.710 --> 02:36:05.490]  Show Road to Tyranny.
[02:36:05.870 --> 02:36:08.691]  Take 15, 20 minutes of questions and answers.
[02:36:09.032 --> 02:36:11.753]  Then we'll show John Carpenter's They Live at about 9.30.
[02:36:12.533 --> 02:36:17.535]  So you should be out of there by about 11.30 or so that evening.
[02:36:17.575 --> 02:36:21.837]  That's Houston, Texas, Alamo Drafthouse, West Oaks Shopping Center.
[02:36:22.177 --> 02:36:23.157]  Remember the Alamo.
[02:36:23.177 --> 02:36:24.498]  It's a luxury movie theater.
[02:36:24.878 --> 02:36:26.398]  Got your own tables and everything.
[02:36:26.438 --> 02:36:27.059]  I mean, it's nice.
[02:36:27.099 --> 02:36:27.439]  Holds 350 people.
[02:36:29.591 --> 02:36:37.926]  Also, if you live elsewhere and can't come, get Road to Tyranny, get Masters of Terror, get Matrix of Evil, get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:36:37.946 --> 02:36:42.895]  You just heard callers raving about the two new films we've churned out quickly that are some of our best work.
[02:36:43.846 --> 02:36:45.067]  You need to get these videos.
[02:36:45.087 --> 02:36:46.427]  You need to make copies of them.
[02:36:46.447 --> 02:36:52.370]  Who else says, get my work non-copyrighted for non-profit, not for sale educational purposes?
[02:36:52.930 --> 02:36:53.871]  Very few, folks.
[02:36:54.351 --> 02:37:01.094]  Because I know the power lies in you getting the videos, putting them on access, giving them to sheriffs and county commissioners.
[02:37:01.554 --> 02:37:02.835]  Don't count on others to do it.
[02:37:02.975 --> 02:37:04.016]  I want to thank those that have.
[02:37:04.056 --> 02:37:06.537]  But those of you that haven't, you got the videos already?
[02:37:06.737 --> 02:37:07.617]  Make some copies.
[02:37:08.118 --> 02:37:09.038]  Get them out to people.
[02:37:09.778 --> 02:37:12.100]  You know, I put my life on the line to fight the New World Order.
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:18.304]  I'm in this because I have a little bit of honor, and I realize how sick the globalists are, and I'm not going along with them.
[02:37:19.925 --> 02:37:26.309]  So the future of Western civilization is at stake, and frankly, we have the best tools in these videos and the fight that we've found to wake people up.
[02:37:27.089 --> 02:37:34.294]  So go to InfoWars.com, go to PrisonPlanet.com to order via our secure online shopping card, or write me a letter.
[02:37:35.504 --> 02:37:36.225]  We're good to go.
[02:38:05.066 --> 02:38:05.907]  They're just two hours.
[02:38:05.947 --> 02:38:06.287]  I charge $22.
[02:38:06.327 --> 02:38:08.068]  They're over two hours.
[02:38:08.088 --> 02:38:08.888]  We charge $25.95.
[02:38:09.809 --> 02:38:12.250]  And all of your purchases make this show possible, folks.
[02:38:12.270 --> 02:38:18.094]  We don't sell as many videos because we have an honest audience who wouldn't make copies of them if I said don't do it.
[02:38:18.214 --> 02:38:21.055]  And so people make copies and give them to people, and folks don't buy as many.
[02:38:21.296 --> 02:38:21.876]  That's great.
[02:38:22.518 --> 02:38:25.919]  But for those that haven't gotten them and haven't gotten them out to people, please do it.
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:27.620]  Toll-free number to order.
[02:38:27.780 --> 02:38:28.840]  Operators are there right now.
[02:38:29.401 --> 02:38:38.884]  And please, we're having problems with folks not making their address clear and then some of the tapes go out into the black hole out there and they come back later.
[02:38:39.405 --> 02:38:45.947]  Please have the operators read your address back carefully if you do the toll-free number because that's where we're having a few problems.
[02:38:45.967 --> 02:38:46.007]  1-888-
[02:38:49.209 --> 02:38:49.369]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:38:49.629 --> 02:38:52.771]  They can answer your questions.
[02:38:52.791 --> 02:38:53.391]  Great folks.
[02:38:53.431 --> 02:38:56.993]  But again, make sure your name and address is correct, folks.
[02:38:57.013 --> 02:38:59.375]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:38:59.395 --> 02:39:04.058]  Or the best way, InfoWars.com.
[02:39:04.078 --> 02:39:06.179]  I mean, those tapes go out the day we get the order.
[02:39:06.639 --> 02:39:07.520]  Or just write to us.
[02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:08.481]  Another great way to do it.
[02:39:08.841 --> 02:39:09.721]  At 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100.
[02:39:12.563 --> 02:39:18.584]  Austin, Texas, 787-04 or 1-888-253-3139.
[02:39:19.524 --> 02:39:20.244]  Take action.
[02:39:20.284 --> 02:39:20.885]  Get in the fight.
[02:39:20.945 --> 02:39:21.805]  Be part of history.
[02:39:22.485 --> 02:39:26.666]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jay in Colorado.
[02:39:26.706 --> 02:39:27.626]  Jay, thanks for holding.
[02:39:27.646 --> 02:39:28.186]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:39:28.526 --> 02:39:29.186]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:39:29.206 --> 02:39:29.346]  Good.
[02:39:29.386 --> 02:39:34.447]  I was wondering if you could talk about the origin and the subsequent abuse of presidential orders.
[02:39:34.847 --> 02:39:37.988]  Who thought of that genius idea?
[02:39:38.428 --> 02:39:38.688]  Okay.
[02:39:39.449 --> 02:39:41.911]  Obviously, authoritarian.
[02:39:42.332 --> 02:40:01.748]  In 1789, when we got the Constitution and Bill of Rights, they allotted literally a few thousand dollars to adorn the White House, to buy China, to buy meals when the French ambassador or the British ambassador was coming by for dinner.
[02:40:02.769 --> 02:40:07.453]  And an executive order, Congress would give George Washington the power...
[02:40:08.686 --> 02:40:14.189]  To pay for the horse and carriages, to pay for mail, to pay for a secretary.
[02:40:14.209 --> 02:40:15.630]  I think he had like 10 employees.
[02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:17.350]  It was ridiculous.
[02:40:18.551 --> 02:40:19.571]  That's where they started.
[02:40:20.312 --> 02:40:24.814]  With the National Security Act of 1947, the entire government went secret and underground.
[02:40:25.583 --> 02:40:40.809]  And the president became a puppet, and that's when we started seeing the roundup plans and the rest of it, and now Congress has voted away its power on trade, on treaties, on almost everything, on health care, on taxes.
[02:40:41.610 --> 02:40:41.910]  All right.
[02:40:41.930 --> 02:40:42.911]  A couple other little quick things.
[02:41:01.348 --> 02:41:05.330]  Where we got the Statue of Liberty from, namely the Illuminati, supposedly.
[02:41:05.651 --> 02:41:07.492]  We know that torch above our heads.
[02:41:07.552 --> 02:41:12.915]  Yes, it's a giant transvestite, and that's mainstream, folks.
[02:41:13.755 --> 02:41:24.882]  It is a male, or the unisex god-goddess, Lucifer, with the Illuminati torch and the sun god crown, and that's what the maker of it in France said.
[02:41:25.322 --> 02:41:26.963]  I've read mainstream books about it.
[02:41:27.003 --> 02:41:30.045]  It's true, and it's an Illuminati symbol.
[02:41:30.669 --> 02:41:36.770]  Okay, and what was the general Clark's role in Waco?
[02:41:37.171 --> 02:41:40.771]  And lastly, have you read Rule by Secrecy?
[02:41:41.412 --> 02:41:43.572]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[02:41:45.313 --> 02:41:47.813]  I have not read Mars' book.
[02:41:49.374 --> 02:41:50.854]  That's not Tex Mars, Jim Mars.
[02:41:50.954 --> 02:41:51.674]  I have not read that.
[02:41:51.694 --> 02:41:52.434]  I heard it's good.
[02:41:53.334 --> 02:41:55.415]  Take your last question first before I forget about it.
[02:41:56.024 --> 02:42:00.507]  And then I believe you were... Oh, man, my brain's not working because I had three hours of sleep last night.
[02:42:00.527 --> 02:42:03.929]  I was on KOA until 5 in the morning in Denver.
[02:42:04.029 --> 02:42:07.592]  What is the... What was his question?
[02:42:07.672 --> 02:42:11.014]  I let him go, and then... Oh, the next caller can tell me.
[02:42:11.034 --> 02:42:12.335]  Let's bring the next caller up.
[02:42:12.355 --> 02:42:13.756]  For some reason, my brain's not working.
[02:42:14.276 --> 02:42:17.538]  Ed in Utah, what was Jay's other question?
[02:42:18.539 --> 02:42:18.859]  Hello?
[02:42:19.159 --> 02:42:21.180]  Yeah, what was Jay's other question?
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:21.761]  I missed it, too.
[02:42:23.008 --> 02:42:24.790]  Okay, well, sorry about that, Alex.
[02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:26.792]  Somebody may remember it, but go ahead.
[02:42:27.573 --> 02:42:30.015]  Listen, I've got some breaking news here.
[02:42:30.756 --> 02:42:33.639]  Your good ally host in town, Jack Stockwell.
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:35.341]  Yeah, good guy.
[02:42:35.741 --> 02:42:39.945]  Yes, he is, and I'm hoping to let some information out here.
[02:42:40.326 --> 02:42:45.691]  I know that you've talked a little bit about this child theft ring that Ted Gunderson has spoke of, and
[02:42:46.455 --> 02:42:59.185]  Well, what I've covered is the BBC and the Associated Press with DynCorp convicted of kidnapping 200,000 women and children in 2000 and how it's been covered up by the mainstream media.
[02:42:59.365 --> 02:42:59.665]  Yeah.
[02:43:00.005 --> 02:43:10.033]  Well, why I called you today is former Congressman Merrill Cook broke a story here on the same station that your friend Jack Stockwell is on concerning the Thaxton family.
[02:43:10.653 --> 02:43:14.474]  And I'm hoping to get your help a little bit on this, Alex.
[02:43:14.634 --> 02:43:16.975]  Well, you've got to give me some info because I'm ignorant of it.
[02:43:16.995 --> 02:43:19.096]  I know the Jack Stockwell Show on KTALK.
[02:43:19.136 --> 02:43:19.996]  I'm a frequent guest.
[02:43:20.316 --> 02:43:20.657]  Okay.
[02:43:21.557 --> 02:43:27.619]  If I can end up by giving out the website for information that's going out on this.
[02:43:27.679 --> 02:43:30.520]  But it had to do with a vegetarian family.
[02:43:31.050 --> 02:43:34.452]  Which, of course, is being branded as quite controversial.
[02:43:34.632 --> 02:43:36.553]  Oh, I remember, and they grabbed their children, yeah.
[02:43:36.613 --> 02:43:45.037]  Yeah, and, well, the story that you might be familiar with is the one that did break here on the regular news with the Jensen's.
[02:43:45.937 --> 02:43:47.198]  That story is out there.
[02:43:47.498 --> 02:43:55.042]  But there wasn't much coverage on the Thaxton's, which is, like I said, just broke on KTalk with Congressman Merrill Cook.
[02:43:55.529 --> 02:43:55.990]  We're good to go.
[02:44:04.113 --> 02:44:28.227]  And what it is, is since they're vegetarian, they had a very tragic death with their baby a couple years ago, and using that without any certifiable medical data, Alex, they went and took their next age, I believe age seven child, Matthew, they took him away last June, and now the six-month rule is up here in Utah where they're going to adopt it out before there's been any chance by the
[02:44:28.897 --> 02:44:30.418]  Good family.
[02:44:30.638 --> 02:44:33.520]  Well, I know if you don't get your B vitamins, the baby will die.
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:38.122]  They had a bunch of Israeli babies die because of bad formula.
[02:44:38.182 --> 02:44:40.163]  But why did this other baby die?
[02:44:41.044 --> 02:44:43.505]  Well, the one and only baby died.
[02:44:43.765 --> 02:44:50.289]  There's new information from a carbon monoxide expert that it was coming in through bad ventilation.
[02:44:50.609 --> 02:44:54.171]  But the point is, this is the speed with which Child Protective Services...
[02:44:54.611 --> 02:44:55.272]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:44:55.292 --> 02:44:55.932]  I'll tell you what.
[02:45:23.965 --> 02:45:27.170]  Ed, get me some info and I'll have the folks on as guests.
[02:45:27.851 --> 02:45:28.612]  Okay.
[02:45:28.652 --> 02:45:29.574]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:45:29.594 --> 02:45:31.697]  Can I give it out to the website now or not?
[02:45:31.717 --> 02:45:32.118]  Give it out.
[02:45:32.579 --> 02:45:32.759]  What?
[02:45:33.220 --> 02:45:33.941]  Go ahead and give it out.
[02:45:34.202 --> 02:45:35.383]  LifeSave.org.
[02:45:35.824 --> 02:45:36.505]  That's LifeSave.org.
[02:45:38.681 --> 02:45:40.422]  Save, all one word, .org.
[02:45:40.582 --> 02:45:42.703]  Well, that's a good domain name.
[02:45:43.004 --> 02:45:43.484]  Well, it is.
[02:45:43.764 --> 02:45:53.670]  Now, these are vegetarians, and you're talking to a meat-eater here, but I know what the state is up to, and there's a press release on that website with contact numbers, even for you, Alex.
[02:45:54.130 --> 02:45:56.592]  And like I said, Jack Stockwell is quite involved in this.
[02:45:57.312 --> 02:45:59.393]  All right, I will check it out, Ed.
[02:45:59.473 --> 02:46:00.514]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:46:00.794 --> 02:46:04.196]  Thank you, John in Florida, and Leslie, and that's going to be it.
[02:46:04.776 --> 02:46:05.477]  John, go ahead.
[02:46:06.064 --> 02:46:06.424]  Hey, Alex.
[02:46:06.585 --> 02:46:11.849]  I was just calling to see if you had seen the History Channel special they're running on the KKK.
[02:46:13.130 --> 02:46:14.631]  The federal KKK?
[02:46:16.032 --> 02:46:16.613]  No, I haven't.
[02:46:17.193 --> 02:46:17.593]  Oh, okay.
[02:46:17.613 --> 02:46:20.035]  Well, I'm taping it so I can send you the tapes then.
[02:46:20.116 --> 02:46:20.756]  Okay, great.
[02:46:20.776 --> 02:46:21.337]  What's it about?
[02:46:21.637 --> 02:46:25.080]  It's basically what they're trying to do is they're connecting the patriot movement with...
[02:46:26.141 --> 02:46:27.082]  With the KKK.
[02:46:27.102 --> 02:46:29.583]  Yeah, no, that's what the FBI and BATF does.
[02:46:29.644 --> 02:46:36.188]  If somebody talks about the Constitution, they're secretly, and I have the actual FEMA reports on this, they're secretly wearing Klan hats.
[02:46:36.949 --> 02:46:37.449]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:46:37.829 --> 02:46:38.590]  It's disgusting.
[02:46:38.610 --> 02:46:40.611]  They're trying to connect patriots with Al-Qaeda.
[02:46:41.092 --> 02:46:44.414]  Well, the CIA's got the connections, and the FBI's got the connections with the Klan.
[02:46:45.115 --> 02:46:45.735]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[02:46:46.015 --> 02:46:54.121]  And the way they put it all together, they put, like, Timothy McVeigh in with the Oklahoma City thing, like he was the sole one responsible, and he had these militia ties, and...
[02:46:54.935 --> 02:46:56.576]  I mean, you'll see the special.
[02:46:56.616 --> 02:46:57.296]  It's just amazing.
[02:46:57.516 --> 02:46:59.536]  And Clinton tried to say it was Rush Limbaugh's fault.
[02:46:59.556 --> 02:47:00.717]  I mean, we're not going to put up with this.
[02:47:00.737 --> 02:47:01.377]  Yeah.
[02:47:01.717 --> 02:47:04.418]  As if Rush Limbaugh was behind Oklahoma City.
[02:47:04.858 --> 02:47:05.918]  And Clinton said that.
[02:47:06.819 --> 02:47:07.399]  That's amazing.
[02:47:07.539 --> 02:47:08.999]  Yeah, he's trying to knock out his competition.
[02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:14.201]  You know, I was going to say, did you ever see the special that Fox ran about three or four years ago?
[02:47:14.221 --> 02:47:17.102]  It was called America's Vanished Freedom 1 and 2.
[02:47:17.542 --> 02:47:23.524]  Yeah, that was before Fox got really bad, but it was a good... Actually, I had the producer on of that show.
[02:47:24.582 --> 02:47:26.164]  About the land grabbing, it was excellent.
[02:47:26.404 --> 02:47:30.288]  Yeah, yeah, okay, because I had called them to see if they would rerun it, and they said they had no intentions.
[02:47:30.768 --> 02:47:31.669]  Obviously, now they've changed.
[02:47:32.855 --> 02:47:33.716]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:47:33.756 --> 02:47:34.416]  I appreciate it.
[02:47:34.856 --> 02:47:41.019]  Yeah, because they can put out real news when Clinton's in and act like it's his fault, but when it accelerates under Bush, they've got to act like it's not the case.
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:43.921]  Leslie in Virginia, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:47:44.281 --> 02:47:45.081]  Thank you there, Alex.
[02:47:45.101 --> 02:47:47.543]  I appreciate you letting me take part in your program.
[02:47:47.563 --> 02:47:48.163]  Appreciate you.
[02:47:48.223 --> 02:47:48.583]  Go ahead.
[02:47:48.823 --> 02:47:51.565]  I just wanted to make a comment for whatever it's worth there.
[02:47:51.585 --> 02:47:58.108]  I mean, when I consider everything that I've learned from your program and Tex Mars' program, which I listen to faithfully daily,
[02:47:59.562 --> 02:48:10.470]  I'm reminded of a statement that a man made, the most inspirational statement I've ever heard by Horace Greeley, who was the founder of the New York Tribune in 1852, I think it was.
[02:48:11.111 --> 02:48:23.400]  But he stated that, as I'm a born-again Christian, he stated that it is impossible, since enslavement is the total goal, he stated that it is impossible to mentally or sociably enslave a Bible-reading people.
[02:48:24.253 --> 02:48:35.719]  And, of course, when I consider what Christ has said, I see what the action of Christ's prophetic words is when I hear people like yourself, when he said, There's nothing hidden that shall not be revealed.
[02:48:36.439 --> 02:48:39.661]  There's just so much inspiration involved here.
[02:48:39.701 --> 02:48:47.525]  It's such encouragement, even though in the dark times here that we face, which, of course, you talk about Nero,
[02:48:48.373 --> 02:48:54.158]  When he persecuted the Christians, instead of getting fear, that driven them more into faith in their God to give up their lives for Christ.
[02:48:54.178 --> 02:48:55.079]  Yeah, that's what I've said.
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:48:57.601]  They're separating the wheat from the chaff.
[02:48:57.621 --> 02:48:59.523]  They're hardening the steel and the fire.
[02:48:59.543 --> 02:49:03.787]  And people wouldn't be waking up if the globalists hadn't moved so quickly.
[02:49:04.127 --> 02:49:10.032]  And they're moving quickly because people were starting to wake up, but they've only accelerated it, and a lot of their programs are in trouble right now.
[02:49:10.353 --> 02:49:11.133]  That's exactly right.
[02:49:11.494 --> 02:49:14.877]  And, you know, it's a total classical case of the...
[02:49:15.858 --> 02:49:19.621]  Sheep and wolves and sheep clothing.
[02:49:20.161 --> 02:49:22.082]  When a person figures that out, then they know what to do.
[02:49:22.122 --> 02:49:22.963]  They just know how to act.
[02:49:24.624 --> 02:49:25.684]  Absolutely, my friend.
[02:49:25.724 --> 02:49:26.905]  You're totally on target.
[02:49:27.886 --> 02:49:29.247]  I just wanted to say that.
[02:49:29.287 --> 02:49:32.028]  It's just so encouraging here.
[02:49:32.068 --> 02:49:33.689]  I pray for your efforts there.
[02:49:34.370 --> 02:49:36.151]  I appreciate your information.
[02:49:36.551 --> 02:49:41.894]  It's made me an active part because it makes us all involved.
[02:49:41.994 --> 02:49:44.536]  This is our sovereignty, our constitutional rights.
[02:49:45.290 --> 02:49:50.794]  And above all, the basic foundation of what this country is founded upon, and that's God's Word Himself.
[02:49:51.494 --> 02:49:53.156]  And I really appreciate your time there.
[02:49:53.176 --> 02:49:53.916]  That's all I wanted to say.
[02:49:54.076 --> 02:49:55.037]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:49:55.057 --> 02:50:01.081]  I'm going to recap top stories and a few news items we haven't gotten to when we get back.
[02:50:01.161 --> 02:50:02.822]  Like, we can implant false memories.
[02:50:02.862 --> 02:50:03.763]  That's a London Guardian.
[02:50:04.584 --> 02:50:09.427]  I could talk about that for hour after hour by itself.
[02:50:09.507 --> 02:50:12.169]  Also, teen generation will be the world's sickest adults.
[02:50:13.155 --> 02:50:17.218]  And I'm going to get Paul Watson on tomorrow to talk about joint task force told face-to-face.
[02:50:17.579 --> 02:50:19.060]  Blackout was a military test.
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:20.661]  This is documented, folks.
[02:50:20.681 --> 02:50:22.082]  Remember the big blackouts?
[02:50:22.743 --> 02:50:29.028]  But I have an article here about Bush being more liberal than Clinton out of the Orange County Register.
[02:50:29.889 --> 02:50:30.870]  Conservative columnist.
[02:50:30.990 --> 02:50:36.214]  More and more people are looking at the rhetoric and separating it from the actions.
[02:50:36.874 --> 02:50:39.837]  They're looking at the meat and potatoes, not the veneers.
[02:50:41.027 --> 02:50:42.527]  We're not saying vote for the Democrats.
[02:50:42.547 --> 02:50:44.008]  We're saying look at the reality.
[02:50:47.189 --> 02:50:50.129]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:50:50.790 --> 02:50:52.090]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:50:52.290 --> 02:50:58.031]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:50:58.291 --> 02:51:03.553]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:51:03.853 --> 02:51:07.954]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:51:08.174 --> 02:51:11.957]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:51:12.217 --> 02:51:16.861]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:51:16.941 --> 02:51:23.205]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:51:23.245 --> 02:51:25.067]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:51:25.547 --> 02:51:27.628]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[02:51:41.593 --> 02:51:43.094]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:51:43.274 --> 02:51:45.315]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:51:46.224 --> 02:51:52.128]  Oh my... I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[02:51:52.268 --> 02:51:52.888]  Yes, it's true.
[02:51:52.908 --> 02:51:55.670]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[02:51:55.790 --> 02:51:59.773]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[02:51:59.873 --> 02:52:00.453]  You heard it right.
[02:52:00.593 --> 02:52:05.576]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[02:52:05.656 --> 02:52:06.677]  The list goes on and on.
[02:52:06.937 --> 02:52:07.678]  You may miss out forever.
[02:52:23.592 --> 02:52:24.132]  We're good to go.
[02:52:46.272 --> 02:52:56.999]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:52:57.179 --> 02:53:04.784]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:53:05.104 --> 02:53:05.765]  We're good to go.
[02:53:20.962 --> 02:53:24.864]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:53:24.904 --> 02:53:26.805]  The water level is always visible.
[02:53:26.985 --> 02:53:32.908]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:53:33.168 --> 02:53:37.110]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:53:37.130 --> 02:53:37.690]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:53:48.928 --> 02:53:54.971]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:53:55.571 --> 02:53:58.613]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:01.214 --> 02:54:02.875]  I just want to have a program note here.
[02:54:03.875 --> 02:54:07.837]  The folks running the show are doing the jobs of two or three people, George and Stephanie.
[02:54:08.499 --> 02:54:10.000]  They're doing an amazing job.
[02:54:10.381 --> 02:54:16.205]  I thank them for their work, the affiliates, the sponsors, the listeners, number one, and of course God, well, number one.
[02:54:16.686 --> 02:54:19.228]  But when we're talking about people, the listeners, number one.
[02:54:20.601 --> 02:54:21.661]  We're good to go.
[02:54:43.962 --> 02:54:45.062]  Keep it all coming.
[02:54:45.082 --> 02:54:47.783]  Major newspapers call me.
[02:54:48.163 --> 02:54:54.965]  I woke up at 6.30 yesterday, worked until 5 a.m., and went to sleep about 5.30 and slept until about 8.30.
[02:54:55.245 --> 02:54:57.445]  I'm not bragging.
[02:54:57.926 --> 02:55:03.747]  I'm just saying when you call me, email me, or you've got questions, I'm sorry if I don't get back to you quickly or my staff doesn't.
[02:55:03.767 --> 02:55:04.487]  We're trying.
[02:55:05.207 --> 02:55:09.549]  If you support us by getting the videos, we can hire more people to give you a better response.
[02:55:09.609 --> 02:55:10.309]  It's out of control.
[02:55:11.443 --> 02:55:11.663]  I think so.
[02:55:31.158 --> 02:55:31.778]  We're good to go.
[02:55:32.179 --> 02:55:33.059]  We're good to go.
[02:55:48.048 --> 02:55:48.569]  We're good to go.
[02:56:10.742 --> 02:56:14.065]  Unreliability since Richard Nixon was sworn in as president.
[02:56:14.165 --> 02:56:31.440]  Early on in her research, she would invite people into her lab, show them traffic accidents, feed them false information and leading questions, and find that they subsequently recall details of the science of the scenes differently and finding that has since been replicated hundreds of times.
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:34.282]  And it gets into how to place false memories.
[02:56:35.243 --> 02:56:35.964]  Here's another one.
[02:56:37.432 --> 02:56:40.294]  Teen generation will be world's sickest adults.
[02:56:40.334 --> 02:56:50.581]  London Telegraph, the present generation of children and teenagers will turn into the most obese and infertile adults in the history of mankind, doctors warned yesterday.
[02:56:51.142 --> 02:56:55.344]  Yeah, they're saying like 70-year-old men have higher sperm counts than young people in the U.S.
[02:56:55.384 --> 02:56:55.745]  and England.
[02:56:56.285 --> 02:57:02.409]  The drinking, eating, sexual, drug-taking, and smoking habits of adolescents were creating a public health time bomb, they said.
[02:57:02.449 --> 02:57:03.350]  It's the vaccines, folks.
[02:57:04.031 --> 02:57:05.932]  And I'm going to get Paul Watson on
[02:57:34.611 --> 02:57:48.587]  Probably tomorrow on this subject, Joint Task Force told face-to-face Blackout was a military test, an under-publicized public comment meeting, which was publicly announced by a Department of Energy news release.
[02:57:48.707 --> 02:57:54.334]  Michael Caine outlined his report published at the Global Free Press, stating that August 14th Blackout was part of a...
[02:57:56.320 --> 02:57:57.201]  I'm out of time, folks.
[02:57:57.241 --> 02:57:57.701]  Great show today.
[02:57:57.721 --> 02:57:58.221]  Great listeners.
[02:57:58.281 --> 02:57:58.782]  Great callers.
[02:57:58.882 --> 02:57:59.082]  All of you.
[02:57:59.122 --> 02:58:01.764]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:58:23.695 --> 02:58:28.503]  Then I'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central, right here on this network and on this same station.
[02:58:28.863 --> 02:58:32.930]  Please spread the word, stand up against tyranny, and fight the New World Order.
[02:58:32.990 --> 02:58:33.691]  God bless you all.
[02:58:36.761 --> 02:58:37.361]  Hello, folks.
[02:58:37.381 --> 02:58:38.342]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:58:38.742 --> 02:58:44.485]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:58:44.726 --> 02:58:49.868]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:58:50.209 --> 02:58:59.514]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:58:59.854 --> 02:59:04.777]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:59:05.117 --> 02:59:09.119]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:59:09.319 --> 02:59:14.101]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:59:14.461 --> 02:59:20.363]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:59:20.703 --> 02:59:29.747]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:59:29.927 --> 02:59:30.928]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:59:30.948 --> 02:59:32.008]  Not yet available in Iowa.
