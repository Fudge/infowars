[00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:06.281]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:15.429]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.131]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:18.972]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:20.433]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.194 --> 00:00:23.116]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:26.398]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:31.002]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.598 --> 00:00:42.439]  Alright, my friends, we're live.
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:51.682]  It's already Friday, and it's the first day of August 2003.
[00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:54.123]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:54.143 --> 00:01:02.226]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:04.487]  I want to do things a little bit different today.
[00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:08.837]  And I'm going to hold myself to this.
[00:01:09.217 --> 00:01:17.642]  We're going to take calls by the third segment, by 24 minutes into the hour.
[00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:26.387]  So I'm about to throw out a bunch of news stories, different topics, anything you'd like to chime in on, you're welcome to call in.
[00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:32.992]  Any of the articles I mention, you're welcome to comment on them, or if you have any questions for me, or I might have questions for you.
[00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:40.477]  Any local news story that I haven't heard about, or a news story you think I'm not mentioning that is important.
[00:01:41.778 --> 00:01:45.400]  I like that C-SPAN journal in the morning when I have a chance to watch it.
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.682]  I don't watch much TV these days, though.
[00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:52.345]  I can't stand to watch most of it, but I like that C-SPAN journal because...
[00:01:53.307 --> 00:01:55.768]  People call in with news articles.
[00:01:55.828 --> 00:02:02.990]  They say, mention a news article and read a paragraph of it and give us your take on it.
[00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:16.634]  And so you hear all these articles out of little papers, big papers, Canadian papers, British papers, hauling in with all these pieces of news that get filtered out in the national media.
[00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.471]  And this show is about breaking that filter.
[00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:26.353]  I mean, a lot of the real stuff, a lot of the truth, is in the news.
[00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:31.375]  But it's buried in the news wires or in some obscure newspaper.
[00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:41.959]  The really big stories that should get the attention, that should have the legs, are stymied and killed, and everything's blotted out by O.J.
[00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.480]  Simpson or Ilean Gonzalez...
[00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:45.896]  We're good to go.
[00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:04.187]  Basketball star and what's the woman look like?
[00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:06.349]  Oh, we want to see her.
[00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:18.920]  Every news channel reporting on it as our troops are dying, as the economy is faltering, as our liberties are being torched, as patriots are being persecuted.
[00:03:20.822 --> 00:03:22.504]  We try to bypass all that.
[00:03:22.564 --> 00:03:25.547]  You can get Colby Bryant all day long on other channels.
[00:03:25.607 --> 00:03:25.867]  You can
[00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.490]  I think we're good to go.
[00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.874]  They're so worried about everything.
[00:03:57.894 --> 00:04:02.016]  And then that's totally normal and good, but care about your country.
[00:04:02.537 --> 00:04:07.320]  Care about your liberties and freedoms and what the forefathers fought and died for, and you're bad.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.943]  And that's why I keep bashing sports, is because it's a sick religion.
[00:04:13.744 --> 00:04:24.371]  You don't care about your children, you don't care about your country, you don't care about your freedoms, but you know all about football and baseball and soccer and basketball
[00:04:25.544 --> 00:04:26.364]  It's your life.
[00:04:26.524 --> 00:04:48.512]  I have to hear these grown men calling up talking about what some sports star got paid and was it the right decision by the coach or people hear the coach likes to drink and the coach drives a red pickup truck and who cares?
[00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:52.376]  And oh, they're such heroes.
[00:04:53.817 --> 00:04:55.497]  You know, I think John Wayne was a hero.
[00:04:55.537 --> 00:05:01.280]  Did you know he had Soviet hitmen trying to kill him and didn't even want FBI protection?
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.760]  He said, I got the Second Amendment.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.201]  Yeah, that just came out.
[00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:05.281]  I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:06.462]  Bunch of news.
[00:05:06.502 --> 00:05:06.962]  Stay with me.
[00:05:10.402 --> 00:05:14.724]  I have tried many other diets to lose weight and I have not been successful.
[00:05:14.864 --> 00:05:19.785]  Here's more that have lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagen-8 from Vim and Vigor.
[00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:25.247]  With Vim and Vigor I have already lost 28 pounds and I am looking forward to losing more.
[00:05:25.327 --> 00:05:31.830]  I'm an athletic trainer so it intrigued me and I have noticed my skin is softer, my hair
[00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.570]  We're good.
[00:05:48.323 --> 00:05:50.384]  I have lost 28 pounds so far.
[00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:51.605]  I feel great.
[00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:55.466]  That was their personal experience while taking Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[00:05:55.586 --> 00:05:56.527]  What are you waiting for?
[00:05:56.787 --> 00:05:59.828]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN and get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.
[00:05:59.928 --> 00:06:00.349]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.429]  1-800-622-8446.
[00:06:10.382 --> 00:06:14.749]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.356]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:19.496 --> 00:06:23.902]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:23.942 --> 00:06:25.264]  The New World Order.
[00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:26.986]  Can emerge.
[00:06:27.046 --> 00:06:31.271]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:31.331 --> 00:06:38.259]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:40.402]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:40.782 --> 00:06:51.190]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.775]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:57.275 --> 00:06:59.957]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:07:00.017 --> 00:07:00.778]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:00.798 --> 00:07:01.338]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:01.358 --> 00:07:02.319]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:16.262]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:07:16.942 --> 00:07:24.444]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[00:07:24.664 --> 00:07:31.927]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:07:32.187 --> 00:07:36.368]  Potassium iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[00:07:36.548 --> 00:07:37.109]  We're good to go.
[00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:01.386]  Call toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:02.447]  Call now and get free shipping.
[00:08:02.467 --> 00:08:02.867]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:08:02.947 --> 00:08:03.728]  Big Brother.
[00:08:03.748 --> 00:08:04.369]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:05.149]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:06.390]  You want answers?
[00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:06.991]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:23.108 --> 00:08:26.531]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.932 --> 00:08:31.055]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.798 --> 00:08:41.084]  Welcome, welcome, welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:42.445 --> 00:08:50.652]  I'm the maniac who gets on the air and rants and raves about, well, the military-industrial complex.
[00:08:51.992 --> 00:09:00.620]  An official document saying that they want to carry terror out against you, the American people, so they can enslave you.
[00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:08.668]  I'm the maniac who reads ABC News and Baltimore Sun news articles on the air that say that.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:23.965]  I'm the guy that says call the White House, tell them not to carry out 9-1-1 two months before 9-1-1, and I'm the guy that said bin Laden was going to attack New York, and then he worked for the CIA, that they were going to set up a national police force.
[00:09:25.006 --> 00:09:26.126]  I made films about it.
[00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:27.386]  I talked about it on TV.
[00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:28.787]  I talked about it here on the radio.
[00:09:29.327 --> 00:09:30.527]  I understand the globalists.
[00:09:30.668 --> 00:09:31.648]  I know their program.
[00:09:33.912 --> 00:09:35.313]  And I'm not here to scare you.
[00:09:35.493 --> 00:09:51.945]  I have enough respect in you that if you research the information, you're going to have the honor and the will and the courage and the common sense to stand against this because on the surface, it's daunting to stand up to pure evil and tyranny.
[00:09:52.526 --> 00:10:00.792]  But if you know history, you understand that it's much safer to resist evil than to comply with it.
[00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:05.846]  The best defense is a good offense.
[00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:23.654]  And groveling to tyranny will ensure the worst outcome for your society, your country, where your children and your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren will live.
[00:10:24.767 --> 00:10:35.536]  You know, strangely enough, I feel more of a responsibility to my future great-great-grandchildren than I do to even my wife or my children.
[00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:39.880]  Because I have selfish love of my family.
[00:10:40.644 --> 00:10:46.188]  And want to fight the New World Order so they can live in a free society and not be dehumanized.
[00:10:46.248 --> 00:11:07.042]  But if you listen to what the Founding Fathers had to say and read their writings and read the writings of some of the old line philosophers who helped to charter the Western civilization's morals, you understand that it's about the civilization.
[00:11:07.162 --> 00:11:07.943]  It's about...
[00:11:08.556 --> 00:11:22.687]  The future generations, and you feel a debt to those before you that had that understanding, that sense of this cultural expression.
[00:11:23.167 --> 00:11:24.608]  I mean, what is civilization?
[00:11:24.728 --> 00:11:33.475]  It is passing on the accumulated data of all previous generations to the next generation, and we're losing our civilizations.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:45.104]  We're having all of the ideas and common sense and the systems of survival that help Western culture thrive.
[00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:56.248]  That's being burned on the ash heap of a degenerate, mindless, dithering MTV airhead culture.
[00:11:57.368 --> 00:11:59.129]  I was watching Hannity and Combs last night.
[00:11:59.169 --> 00:12:00.489]  Again, I haven't watched TV in weeks.
[00:12:01.129 --> 00:12:02.730]  I did watch a couple hours last night.
[00:12:03.621 --> 00:12:16.884]  And they had the girl on that the news and the newspapers and the Internet had said was Colby Bryant's, the girl he allegedly sexually assaulted.
[00:12:18.024 --> 00:12:20.445]  And, of course, it wasn't the right girl.
[00:12:20.485 --> 00:12:26.626]  The media just picked up on it, and thousands of websites posted it on many of the mainstream news sites.
[00:12:28.055 --> 00:12:35.582]  But just on a side note, watching her, I mean, talk about a dithering, mindless, bug-eyed airhead.
[00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:50.094]  That's the future human, just utterly mindless, just a clone of the TV show Friends, trying to mirror whatever the peer pressure conduit orders her to do.
[00:12:52.566 --> 00:13:04.030]  I mean, our men are slovenly, ignorant, baseball cap-wearing creatures, stumbling around, acting like juvenile delinquents when they're 30 years old.
[00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:14.914]  Our women have been trained to be insecure and to be slathering themselves in endless cosmetic applications and
[00:13:15.915 --> 00:13:23.542]  Running about, you know, living to shop and throw their kids in the daycare where they're vaccinated with deadly bioweapons.
[00:13:24.983 --> 00:13:26.965]  I mean, I'm not trying to be bitter here, folks.
[00:13:27.005 --> 00:13:31.609]  I'm very positive about the good elements of society.
[00:13:31.689 --> 00:13:43.579]  But just when I see the willful ignorance, the people wrapping themselves in a cocoon of mindlessness...
[00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.691]  It's really hard to deal with.
[00:13:48.813 --> 00:13:51.275]  I mean, take this whole Colby Bryant situation.
[00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:52.796]  It's the new O.J.
[00:13:52.876 --> 00:13:53.817]  Simpson story.
[00:13:55.058 --> 00:14:12.192]  And the media knows that the public loves these trials, and it turns into a soap opera, and they will push it until people demand that they move on to something else, and by then they'll have some new diversion.
[00:14:13.064 --> 00:14:15.165]  I mean, does it really affect you in your life?
[00:14:16.705 --> 00:14:20.446]  What some basketball player, he's not a star, he's nothing.
[00:14:21.186 --> 00:14:21.826]  He's nothing.
[00:14:22.966 --> 00:14:30.688]  A fireman who saves a child out of a burning building is a trillion times more important than Colby Bryant who puts a ball in a hoop.
[00:14:32.008 --> 00:14:32.889]  It's pathetic.
[00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:35.429]  And the trashy...
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:46.426]  Broad, and I say trashy because she's out at parties with a married man, going off to hotel rooms with him.
[00:14:46.446 --> 00:14:49.668]  I mean, she doesn't matter to this society.
[00:14:49.728 --> 00:14:50.549]  She's nothing.
[00:14:53.411 --> 00:14:55.192]  None of these people mean anything to me.
[00:14:56.353 --> 00:14:57.254]  They're a joke.
[00:14:57.654 --> 00:15:02.538]  And this sick society tells me that this is the role model?
[00:15:03.379 --> 00:15:06.882]  The collection of gang members in the NFL and the NBA?
[00:15:08.527 --> 00:15:09.287]  I'm sick of it.
[00:15:09.327 --> 00:15:17.669]  And the sports stars on their steroids with their corked bats and all the rest of it.
[00:15:17.869 --> 00:15:18.789]  I'm sick of it!
[00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.430]  Haven't you read history?
[00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:26.811]  Don't you know that in Babylon and Rome, everything was sports diversions?
[00:15:26.851 --> 00:15:28.632]  That's how you control populations.
[00:15:28.952 --> 00:15:34.593]  There were handbooks written 2,000 years ago, 3,000 years ago on how to manipulate the public.
[00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:42.002]  There were stone tablets found in Egypt about how sports were used to control the public.
[00:15:42.322 --> 00:15:43.883]  And I have to sit here and watch it.
[00:15:44.763 --> 00:15:46.764]  And I've been ranting about this more and more.
[00:15:48.305 --> 00:15:54.068]  I mean, I'm somebody who likes to go to the ballpark and eat the popcorn, drink a cold Coca-Cola, and eat a hot dog.
[00:15:55.548 --> 00:15:55.949]  Okay?
[00:15:56.509 --> 00:16:04.413]  And I played football and I played baseball and I played soccer and I was on the swim team and I did all that stuff.
[00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:06.570]  And there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:11.415]  It's just tribal warfare, ritualized tribal warfare.
[00:16:11.875 --> 00:16:19.882]  And if you're involved in sports, if you're playing tennis or on the master swim team or whatever you're doing, that's fine, that's healthy.
[00:16:20.403 --> 00:16:27.969]  But the culture of being the spectator and sitting in the bleachers is sick beyond belief.
[00:16:30.572 --> 00:16:30.872]  It is.
[00:16:31.678 --> 00:16:55.330]  I mean, there's nothing wrong with watching a few football games with the friends over or going to a baseball game, but when it becomes your religion, the focus of your life, and you know all the minutia and all the smallest details of what coaches are paid at obscure colleges and what... I mean, it doesn't matter.
[00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.131]  That's not civilization.
[00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:00.613]  That's a total distraction, and they know it is.
[00:17:02.199 --> 00:17:06.722]  I hear full-grown men calling to talk shows, and they're so concerned.
[00:17:06.742 --> 00:17:07.743]  You'll hear it in their voice.
[00:17:07.783 --> 00:17:17.869]  They'll go, they'll say to the host, I tell you, Billy Bob, it's just terrible how much we paid him, and then he fell down on the job.
[00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:22.812]  And I tell you, you know, I know he's having problems with his mama in the hospital, but...
[00:17:23.487 --> 00:17:31.910]  They say she's down there in Georgia, and I tell you, they need to recover the field and get those holes fixed.
[00:17:32.971 --> 00:17:39.473]  And you're sitting there while the border's wide open, illegals pour in, the factories are all shutting down, they're passing all these gun control laws.
[00:17:40.013 --> 00:17:42.175]  They're building giant prisons everywhere.
[00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:48.640]  They're saying we're all going to have national ID cards, VR drivers license, and thumb scan and face scan to buy and sell.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.062]  They're announcing satellite tracking and taxation for our cars.
[00:17:52.142 --> 00:17:57.806]  It's going in in Germany, Canada, England, about to start in some of the western states and move across the country.
[00:17:58.767 --> 00:18:01.009]  And you try to tell one of these people that, and I have.
[00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:03.591]  I mean, I can talk to a college student.
[00:18:03.611 --> 00:18:04.832]  I can talk to an old black man.
[00:18:04.872 --> 00:18:06.652]  I can talk to a good old boy in a cowboy hat.
[00:18:07.092 --> 00:18:07.652]  They'll listen.
[00:18:07.672 --> 00:18:08.953]  I can talk to a Russian immigrant.
[00:18:08.973 --> 00:18:10.373]  They'll listen, or a Mexican immigrant.
[00:18:11.013 --> 00:18:18.715]  But these middle-class, you know, $100,000 a year sports fans, you'll tell them something.
[00:18:18.755 --> 00:18:21.956]  They'll go, we'll find little satellite tracks.
[00:18:23.776 --> 00:18:27.978]  Well, I guess Bush has got to, you know, compromise and sign the assault weapons ban.
[00:18:27.998 --> 00:18:29.598]  You know, Bush...
[00:18:31.145 --> 00:18:34.668]  Cheney sticker, and then you'll say, but what about blocking Dan Burton's committee?
[00:18:35.128 --> 00:18:35.849]  I'm Hardingate.
[00:18:35.869 --> 00:18:37.510]  Well, I guess Bush has got to do that.
[00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.351]  Hey, I've got to go, Alex.
[00:18:40.272 --> 00:18:41.333]  I've seen your show.
[00:18:42.074 --> 00:18:43.295]  I've heard your radio show.
[00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:44.035]  I don't believe it.
[00:18:44.336 --> 00:18:45.397]  I've got to go play golf.
[00:18:46.177 --> 00:18:47.198]  Come on, Jimmy.
[00:18:47.238 --> 00:18:48.119]  Let's get in the car.
[00:18:48.659 --> 00:18:53.083]  And this will be, they'll start it, you know, walking out of a restaurant, they'll say something to me.
[00:18:54.794 --> 00:18:56.375]  I don't believe that stuff you say.
[00:18:56.395 --> 00:18:58.016]  Well, what do you not believe, sir?
[00:18:58.036 --> 00:19:10.306]  And I'll try to come over and invest time, and they just arrogantly with their little pennant cap will go, I've got to go play golf while our country is gone.
[00:19:12.567 --> 00:19:18.592]  And then I'll hear that same type of individual on the radio, so concerned, so upset.
[00:19:19.757 --> 00:19:20.077]  Really?
[00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:23.858]  You could hear the... I mean, you'd think one of their children was in the hospital.
[00:19:23.898 --> 00:19:27.699]  They're just... They call in so concerned.
[00:19:28.219 --> 00:19:29.119]  I mean, this is sick.
[00:19:29.259 --> 00:19:30.680]  This is mental illness, people.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.580]  This is mental illness.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.241]  And it's just a giant cult.
[00:19:36.641 --> 00:19:41.322]  And the women are all in their little ditzy moron airhead cult.
[00:19:41.942 --> 00:19:48.844]  Women aren't stupid, but the culture trains them how to be the most narrow-minded, emotional, peonic creatures.
[00:19:50.852 --> 00:19:53.613]  Again, we're going to come back and take your calls on this issue.
[00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:57.376]  It's now come out that the Soviets were trying to kill John Wayne.
[00:19:58.657 --> 00:20:04.521]  That's a real hero for his conviction compared to these idiot sports people.
[00:20:05.141 --> 00:20:05.862]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:05.882 --> 00:20:06.883]  I've got a bunch of real news.
[00:20:06.903 --> 00:20:07.303]  Stay with us.
[00:20:10.479 --> 00:20:19.104]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:19.324 --> 00:20:30.591]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:30.851 --> 00:20:33.472]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:33.813 --> 00:20:37.915]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:20:38.115 --> 00:20:40.257]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:40.417 --> 00:20:42.278]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:42.499 --> 00:20:48.523]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:48.763 --> 00:20:54.428]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:20:54.748 --> 00:20:58.690]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.410]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:00.131]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:17.903]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:20.384]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:21:20.585 --> 00:21:26.928]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:21:27.268 --> 00:21:27.929]  We're good to go.
[00:21:47.523 --> 00:21:48.143]  We're good to go.
[00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:13.926]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:22:14.367 --> 00:22:18.911]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:22:19.291 --> 00:22:24.156]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:22:24.536 --> 00:22:26.318]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:27.399]  can barely be read.
[00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:28.640]  It has faded that much.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.903]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[00:22:33.163 --> 00:22:41.529]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.
[00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:48.274]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95 shipping included.
[00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:50.195]  Don't wait.
[00:22:50.215 --> 00:22:50.715]  Do it today.
[00:22:50.755 --> 00:22:51.115]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:23:09.165 --> 00:23:11.908]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:18.476]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[00:23:18.776 --> 00:23:24.663]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them but still have them safe and sound?
[00:23:25.124 --> 00:23:28.868]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax-exempt?
[00:23:29.568 --> 00:23:31.109]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.230]  Well, there is a way.
[00:23:32.491 --> 00:23:38.596]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[00:23:38.976 --> 00:23:49.245]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[00:23:49.285 --> 00:23:50.086]  Constitution.
[00:23:50.386 --> 00:23:51.968]  You don't have to go offshore to do it either.
[00:23:52.268 --> 00:23:54.570]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[00:23:55.010 --> 00:24:02.733]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the Internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[00:24:03.014 --> 00:24:07.496]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[00:24:07.556 --> 00:24:13.158]  He rode a blazing saddle.
[00:24:13.198 --> 00:24:14.399]  He wore a shirt.
[00:24:24.252 --> 00:24:26.493]  Folks, I'll tell you who my heroes are.
[00:24:29.173 --> 00:24:30.833]  It's George Washington.
[00:24:32.134 --> 00:24:50.998]  In many battles, 10 to 1, and they were pulling the buttons off their coats in the middle of winter, pinned down to load their rifles with shrapnel to fight the British soldiers.
[00:24:51.934 --> 00:24:52.515]  We're good to go.
[00:25:09.532 --> 00:25:10.252]  I'm sick of it!
[00:25:10.292 --> 00:25:14.034]  I'm sick of them cramming their MTV sports culture down our throat!
[00:25:37.176 --> 00:25:47.163]  Now, understand, I mean, this has been irritating me for a while, and I'm tired of just mentioning the sick sports culture and how these are heroes, and it's disgusting.
[00:25:48.203 --> 00:26:03.213]  And I'm somebody who, again, played sports, likes to watch it, but it's, let me just say this, when you get obsessed with it, when it becomes your life, when it becomes the biggest part of America, something's wrong.
[00:26:04.597 --> 00:26:13.084]  When that replaces being neighborly and being informed and don't tread on me and come and take it.
[00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:19.649]  You know, one of the Texas battle flags is a cannon telling the Mexican government, come and take it.
[00:26:21.251 --> 00:26:28.396]  Down here in Texas now they say our pastime is Friday night football and that's our religion and that's what symbolizes Texas.
[00:26:28.536 --> 00:26:30.198]  No, don't take my Alamo away!
[00:26:31.286 --> 00:26:32.827]  Don't take Davy Crockett away.
[00:26:33.427 --> 00:26:36.048]  Don't take Travis and Boone away.
[00:26:36.388 --> 00:26:39.369]  Don't give me Friday Night Football.
[00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:45.411]  Don't you replace my American culture with your fraud.
[00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:47.371]  Just don't even try it.
[00:26:47.951 --> 00:26:49.532]  Let's talk to Scott in Pennsylvania.
[00:26:49.552 --> 00:26:50.332]  Scott, you're on the air.
[00:26:50.372 --> 00:26:50.792]  Go ahead.
[00:26:51.713 --> 00:26:52.993]  Yeah, Alex, there's a billboard.
[00:26:53.153 --> 00:26:53.973]  Thanks for taking the call.
[00:26:53.993 --> 00:26:58.935]  There's a billboard in Youngstown, Ohio that says we can be afraid or we can be ready.
[00:26:59.946 --> 00:27:03.369]  And there's a website, www.ready.gov.
[00:27:03.569 --> 00:27:19.084]  Yeah, there's radio, TV ads, FEMA break-ins on TV and radio, billboards, and it's Governor Ridge with his snout up there telling us that we can submit to them and do what they say and we'll all be okay.
[00:27:19.944 --> 00:27:24.909]  And Chemtrails, a friend in Ohio, their dad showed me what they are about and that.
[00:27:25.638 --> 00:27:27.199]  I'm seeing them big time today.
[00:27:27.219 --> 00:27:30.761]  We went from blue skies to cloudiness in a matter of a couple of hours.
[00:27:31.181 --> 00:27:36.104]  Well, again, they are spraying the entire state for two months straight.
[00:27:36.124 --> 00:27:37.224]  It's been going on for two months.
[00:27:37.645 --> 00:27:39.686]  They say now it'll just go on indefinitely.
[00:27:39.726 --> 00:27:47.530]  It was just going to be in one town, but again, they increase it, and that's Channel 5 News, that's the Associated Press in Daly, Oklahoma.
[00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:54.814]  They've got spray jets, spray planes, and helicopters spraying every town basically in the state with bacteria
[00:27:57.923 --> 00:27:58.463]  You name it.
[00:27:58.883 --> 00:28:02.086]  And that's mainstream news on my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:28:02.587 --> 00:28:07.371]  And then we also post the BBC article where they admit they killed our own troops.
[00:28:08.284 --> 00:28:12.925]  In the 1980s, outside Porton Down over in England, they had U.S.
[00:28:12.985 --> 00:28:15.426]  and British troops stand out in a field to be nerve-gassed.
[00:28:15.786 --> 00:28:17.106]  This happened hundreds of times.
[00:28:17.647 --> 00:28:22.448]  They did it to thousands of troops, and they just admit, yeah, we killed them, and that's the way it is.
[00:28:22.468 --> 00:28:23.968]  So we're going to trust this government.
[00:28:25.189 --> 00:28:29.190]  And I'm the weirdo for reading these articles on air, you understand, Scott.
[00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:37.252]  I was in Massachusetts over the weekend, and I saw for myself, Big Brother's watching, and they got cameras over the red lights and
[00:28:38.744 --> 00:28:40.225]  You know, all over the place.
[00:28:41.806 --> 00:28:49.892]  And I spoke to the State Senator Bob Robbins that I gave the Road to Journey to, and he just says you're a kook.
[00:28:49.952 --> 00:28:56.476]  I don't, but, you know, that's just... Hold on, the State Senator already knew who I was?
[00:28:56.496 --> 00:29:01.280]  State Senator Bob Robbins, yeah, I gave him the Road to Journey video.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:06.103]  But did he read the back and call me a kook, or did he just say, oh, yeah, I know this guy, he's a kook?
[00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:09.999]  No, he just watched it, and he just doesn't want to believe it or something.
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.380]  Oh, okay.
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.162]  So when we have ABC News and Baltimore Sun saying the U.S.
[00:29:16.202 --> 00:29:22.985]  government planned to hijack jet airliners and crash them to get martial law, that was before 9-1-1, official U.S.
[00:29:23.025 --> 00:29:23.785]  government plans.
[00:29:24.645 --> 00:29:26.146]  Of course, they won't report on it after 9-1-1.
[00:29:26.226 --> 00:29:32.088]  It just so happened we have news reports and the document before 9-1-1 where they were planning it.
[00:29:32.869 --> 00:29:33.909]  I guess he doesn't want to.
[00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:35.770]  I guess we're kooks for covering that.
[00:29:37.742 --> 00:29:37.962]  Yep.
[00:29:38.462 --> 00:29:40.223]  Well, yeah, that's what I just said, Scott.
[00:29:41.043 --> 00:29:46.426]  They're announcing that their satellite tracker boxes are already in all the new cars and they're going to tax us.
[00:29:47.166 --> 00:29:52.008]  The public admits they've heard about it, but I'm the kook for being against it, see?
[00:29:52.588 --> 00:29:56.149]  I saw a clip on that box on Fox last night.
[00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.810]  Yeah, 40 million cars.
[00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:58.470]  Thanks for the call.
[00:30:00.511 --> 00:30:01.432]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.912 --> 00:30:03.532]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.433 --> 00:30:07.114]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.453 --> 00:30:13.475]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:30:13.775 --> 00:30:18.719]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:30:18.959 --> 00:30:21.500]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they have been inhaled.
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.863]  Either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:29.546]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[00:30:36.258 --> 00:30:38.159]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:30:38.659 --> 00:30:41.500]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.180]  Welcome back.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:44.861]  33 minutes into the hour.
[00:30:44.881 --> 00:30:48.642]  Got another 2 hours and 26 minutes left in the show today.
[00:30:48.662 --> 00:30:55.164]  The broadcast, the alert, your freedoms, your liberties, your heritage.
[00:30:55.942 --> 00:30:56.643]  We're good to go.
[00:30:56.663 --> 00:30:57.783]  We're good to go.
[00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:23.401]  Or if you disagree with something I've said, you will go to the front of the line, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:31:23.541 --> 00:31:29.343]  I'm about to go right back to your calls.
[00:31:29.403 --> 00:31:34.924]  Coming up, calls for renewed urgency in terror war.
[00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:41.487]  They were going to cut the funding for Homeland Security, and then surprise, surprise, the agencies that were going to get their funding cut.
[00:31:41.847 --> 00:31:45.528]  They massively increased it, and they were just going to kind of let the growth stop.
[00:31:46.478 --> 00:31:51.924]  Suddenly, all those agencies put out reports, hijackings are about to happen, you're about to get hit by terrorists any minute.
[00:31:52.324 --> 00:31:54.546]  Okay, okay, we'll give you more funds.
[00:31:55.127 --> 00:31:58.430]  The agencies go, that's right, there's still going to be terror, though.
[00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:02.154]  We're going to get more funds, don't you worry, and give us your liberty.
[00:32:02.655 --> 00:32:03.575]  So that's coming up.
[00:32:04.737 --> 00:32:09.902]  Return of the nosy babushka is the headline of the Christian Science Monitor.
[00:32:10.817 --> 00:32:13.279]  About the secret police being reactivated.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.682]  The Stasi in Russia.
[00:32:16.702 --> 00:32:22.948]  I know the Stasi were in East Germany, but it's a Russian system.
[00:32:23.468 --> 00:32:24.369]  So that's coming up.
[00:32:24.489 --> 00:32:27.332]  Also, Blair hit hard by suicide scandal.
[00:32:27.812 --> 00:32:30.595]  Oh, yeah, suicide, sure, of Dr. David Kelly.
[00:32:31.095 --> 00:32:34.058]  Homeland Security, Hortz, Silicon Valley.
[00:32:34.793 --> 00:32:39.575]  They want Silicon Valley to make their major initiatives to be for surveillance of you and your family.
[00:32:40.095 --> 00:32:45.077]  The face scanning cameras and the microphones and the Total Information Awareness Network.
[00:32:45.157 --> 00:32:45.977]  It's not enough.
[00:32:46.117 --> 00:32:51.639]  Oh, by the way, Admiral Poindexter is going to have to resign the next few weeks, they say.
[00:32:51.699 --> 00:32:55.981]  The convicted felon that wanted to bet on dead and dying U.S.
[00:32:56.021 --> 00:32:57.101]  citizens and troops.
[00:32:57.848 --> 00:32:58.929]  As well as what U.S.
[00:32:58.949 --> 00:33:04.192]  cities would get nuked by North Korea or what Middle Eastern leader would be assassinated next.
[00:33:04.232 --> 00:33:05.513]  He's going to have to resign.
[00:33:06.233 --> 00:33:08.815]  Folks, Admiral Poindexter didn't do any of this.
[00:33:08.835 --> 00:33:10.316]  This is more diversions.
[00:33:11.076 --> 00:33:17.380]  DARPA, five years ago, the federal agency that runs all this, had put cameras and microphones up in Austin.
[00:33:18.001 --> 00:33:21.082]  I have the Austin American Statesman five years ago.
[00:33:22.123 --> 00:33:25.065]  Long before Mr. Convicted Felham was back in government.
[00:33:27.302 --> 00:33:31.203]  But again, they make you think Patriot Act 1 and 2 comes from Ashcroft.
[00:33:31.223 --> 00:33:36.665]  They make you think it comes from Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton or George Bush.
[00:33:36.745 --> 00:33:39.246]  They're all just puppets, folks, okay?
[00:33:39.846 --> 00:33:44.387]  It's the military-industrial complex and the private banks that own it that own the media.
[00:33:44.767 --> 00:33:46.808]  They're the folks writing the policies.
[00:33:48.593 --> 00:33:51.935]  To Homeland Security Court, Silicon Valley, Giuliani.
[00:33:52.055 --> 00:33:53.315]  Oh, he's so good.
[00:33:53.335 --> 00:33:58.718]  He's going to raise $300 million for police state measures and give it to private companies.
[00:33:58.818 --> 00:34:08.242]  Oh, it's a wonderful new form of charity, just like United Way and Red Cross gave a lot of the money, tens of millions of it, not to the firemen.
[00:34:08.302 --> 00:34:09.203]  Oh, they don't get anything.
[00:34:09.743 --> 00:34:10.483]  Or the police.
[00:34:10.543 --> 00:34:10.904]  No, no, no.
[00:34:11.164 --> 00:34:13.205]  To Handgun Control Incorporated.
[00:34:13.245 --> 00:34:13.685]  Yeah.
[00:34:15.268 --> 00:34:18.549]  Global Farm Study aims for food security.
[00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:22.750]  The World Bank and IMF want you to eat genetically modified food.
[00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.951]  They want to force the world to accept it.
[00:34:25.331 --> 00:34:29.452]  We'll talk about how they attack the third world with their promise of aid.
[00:34:29.472 --> 00:34:33.053]  Folks, there's so much here.
[00:34:33.073 --> 00:34:33.933]  I've got this article.
[00:34:34.093 --> 00:34:34.673]  It's now come out.
[00:34:34.713 --> 00:34:37.994]  It's confirmed that Stalin tried to have John Wayne killed.
[00:34:39.756 --> 00:34:40.637]  Yes, it's true.
[00:34:41.097 --> 00:34:47.923]  And when the FBI went to warn John Wayne that killers were on his trail in Hollywood, John Wayne said, hey, go home, boys.
[00:34:48.043 --> 00:34:49.124]  I got the Second Amendment.
[00:34:49.144 --> 00:34:50.085]  He actually said that.
[00:34:50.825 --> 00:34:58.472]  And it turns out he, quote, survived an assassination attempt and then didn't even want to talk about it when the communists tried to kill him.
[00:34:59.433 --> 00:35:00.734]  Amazing article coming up.
[00:35:01.194 --> 00:35:03.156]  That's on Infowars.com, by the way.
[00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:08.582]  Palestinian boys' organs gives Israelis new life.
[00:35:09.142 --> 00:35:10.403]  Isn't that wonderful?
[00:35:11.784 --> 00:35:18.490]  It turns out the family has been abused and beaten up by Israelis.
[00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:19.991]  I've got several articles here on it.
[00:35:20.872 --> 00:35:29.960]  And they said to prove their love, they gave the organs and it saved five people.
[00:35:30.757 --> 00:35:31.578]  Five Israelis.
[00:35:31.598 --> 00:35:34.260]  They wanted the organs given to Israelis.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.861]  This is from Reuters.
[00:35:37.462 --> 00:35:40.664]  Interesting little article here about turning the other cheek.
[00:35:44.247 --> 00:35:46.028]  Or the killing can just continue.
[00:35:46.048 --> 00:35:54.915]  I mean, both sides are wrong in what's going on over there.
[00:35:56.055 --> 00:35:57.777]  Both groups have criminal governments.
[00:35:58.843 --> 00:36:00.705]  And that's just how the criminal governments like it.
[00:36:00.905 --> 00:36:02.086]  They like the turmoil.
[00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:04.328]  They get the funds if there's a crisis.
[00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:07.710]  Okay, so that's coming up.
[00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:11.834]  Also, North Korean nukes could number 250 by 2010.
[00:36:11.914 --> 00:36:18.639]  Folks, they've already got the systems to build 100 nukes a year, according to the Associated Press.
[00:36:18.779 --> 00:36:20.361]  That's just some of the news that's coming up.
[00:36:21.221 --> 00:36:24.284]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Mark in Minnesota.
[00:36:24.324 --> 00:36:24.925]  Go ahead, Mark.
[00:36:25.545 --> 00:36:25.985]  Hey, Alex.
[00:36:26.005 --> 00:36:26.526]  How are you doing?
[00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:27.367]  Fantastic.
[00:36:27.507 --> 00:36:27.807]  All right.
[00:36:28.368 --> 00:36:34.853]  Article from today, terror, quote-unquote, chatter seems to target ferries.
[00:36:38.375 --> 00:36:45.000]  The FBI has intercepted tidbits of information about Al-Qaeda's plans for terror attacks that indicate the U.S.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.921]  ferry systems could be the next targets.
[00:36:46.941 --> 00:36:52.385]  It says, quote, they talked about using scuba divers and other means to attack marine traffic.
[00:36:52.585 --> 00:36:53.366]  They're interested in this.
[00:36:54.082 --> 00:37:01.584]  Intelligence indicates that they are still interested in this, but there's nothing specific, said Seattle FBI spokesman Ray Lauer.
[00:37:03.225 --> 00:37:07.186]  Now, this just sounds like a slapstick comedy.
[00:37:07.206 --> 00:37:15.229]  I mean, out of all, I mean, why would terrorists, I mean, what would you hope to accomplish by attacking a ferry?
[00:37:15.809 --> 00:37:17.650]  Okay, I didn't read it yesterday.
[00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.070]  I dropped the ball in a big way.
[00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.051]  It's in the stack.
[00:37:20.251 --> 00:37:21.251]  It was on the website.
[00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.032]  It's on Infowars.com, right now, main page.
[00:37:25.572 --> 00:37:28.634]  Hold on, let me just say something.
[00:37:29.234 --> 00:37:30.975]  Let me just say what's on the site.
[00:37:32.136 --> 00:37:38.580]  Australia put out a detailed report of key infrastructure points that terrorists could attack.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.341]  They're advertising it.
[00:37:40.741 --> 00:37:43.983]  They advertise that schools are a good place to have a mass shooting.
[00:37:44.043 --> 00:37:46.004]  They advertise ferries.
[00:37:46.044 --> 00:37:48.826]  Now remember, in Washington State,
[00:37:51.833 --> 00:37:53.056]  They refused.
[00:37:53.196 --> 00:37:57.844]  There's been a two-year battle to let them search every car getting on a ferry.
[00:37:57.964 --> 00:38:04.737]  This is about the NTSB, and this is about the air marshals, and this is about the federal government, as we said it would.
[00:38:06.013 --> 00:38:07.835]  First thing, you don't have any Fourth Amendment.
[00:38:07.875 --> 00:38:08.936]  Everybody gets searched.
[00:38:09.236 --> 00:38:11.098]  We arrest you if you look at us wrong.
[00:38:11.358 --> 00:38:14.181]  We take you to jail for having a straw in your drink.
[00:38:14.982 --> 00:38:17.964]  We tear through all your goods.
[00:38:18.004 --> 00:38:23.630]  And, of course, an illegal alien who hates America named Habib generally is the one who's going to be doing this to you.
[00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:25.692]  We're going to grope your wife.
[00:38:27.124 --> 00:38:42.463]  And I said, it's going to be on bridges, it's going to be in factories, it's going to be on ferries, it's going to be on buses, because I've already seen a move before 9-1-1 with the feds announcing they want to put federal troops, I mean regular army troops,
[00:38:42.863 --> 00:38:47.286]  On the ferries, on the buses, at the bus stops, on the overpasses.
[00:38:47.646 --> 00:38:56.090]  And so they started this with the airports and, well, the streets of New York and New Jersey and in the tunnel and on the Brooklyn Bridge.
[00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:59.792]  And see, now it's, oh, we've got to do it at the ferries.
[00:39:00.212 --> 00:39:02.093]  And there was a big fight in Washington State.
[00:39:02.454 --> 00:39:07.036]  Even the locals said, no, you're not going to search every car getting on and off a ferry.
[00:39:08.094 --> 00:39:09.816]  I mean, you know, it's ridiculous.
[00:39:10.196 --> 00:39:22.625]  But again, it's about training us and expanding the federal scope of their forces, and it's about internal checkpoints on the highways that were announced in 1998 by the federal government.
[00:39:22.665 --> 00:39:29.210]  So they set the infrastructure up, they built it now, then they carry out the terror, and then tell us we've got to accept it.
[00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.591]  Go ahead.
[00:39:29.631 --> 00:39:35.455]  You know, it did seem like they're almost advertising for, you know, ferries as a target.
[00:39:35.885 --> 00:39:47.952]  It says in this article, quote, the easy access and minimal security checks associated with allowing passenger vehicles on board make ferries particularly vulnerable to vehicle-borne improved explosive devices.
[00:39:48.413 --> 00:39:49.353]  Which is ridiculous.
[00:39:49.413 --> 00:39:55.197]  I mean, a terrorist could drive a truckload of explosives into the school gymnasium.
[00:39:56.057 --> 00:40:00.300]  They could... I mean, there's masses of people everywhere.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.601]  But, see, that's the argument.
[00:40:02.021 --> 00:40:03.422]  Oh, the terrorists could get us.
[00:40:03.482 --> 00:40:03.742]  And, see...
[00:40:04.422 --> 00:40:08.265]  I predicted because they were making a big deal out of these ferries two years ago, by the way, Mark.
[00:40:08.425 --> 00:40:11.867]  Now, here's an article... Listen, I predict the feds are going to blow one of these ferries.
[00:40:11.887 --> 00:40:12.308]  Go ahead.
[00:40:12.348 --> 00:40:15.049]  Yeah, now, here's an article from January 4th of this year.
[00:40:15.089 --> 00:40:15.610]  It says, U.S.
[00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.472]  plans to start tracking Americans who travel abroad.
[00:40:18.492 --> 00:40:19.512]  This is what it says on that.
[00:40:19.933 --> 00:40:29.419]  All commercial airlines, cargo flights, cruise ships, and other vessels carrying crew or passengers would be affected, with the exception of most ferry boats...
[00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:35.442]  And then the reasons they give is, well, we don't want encroachments upon our rights.
[00:40:35.562 --> 00:40:36.764]  And I'm thinking, well, wait a minute.
[00:40:37.205 --> 00:40:40.450]  Okay, Bush founded the new Maritime Administration.
[00:40:41.191 --> 00:40:42.873]  Since when have they cared about not encroaching them?
[00:40:42.893 --> 00:40:43.935]  I'll tell you what the plan is.
[00:40:44.821 --> 00:40:51.044]  If you go on a cruise now, they make you retina scan and thumb scan and give you a pass.
[00:40:51.484 --> 00:41:09.951]  The cruise ship company worker is carrying out a customs official duty and you're being enrolled in the biometric passport system that MSNBC reported on that all countries are being told by the UN they must adopt it by next year.
[00:41:10.862 --> 00:41:16.646]  Oh, and it just so happens most states were face scanning and thumb scanning you to get a driver's license six, seven, eight years ago.
[00:41:17.006 --> 00:41:21.729]  See, they put the infrastructure in, then announce it and say it's for terror.
[00:41:21.749 --> 00:41:22.749]  Go ahead, Mark.
[00:41:22.789 --> 00:41:28.033]  Real quick, I was just wondering, have you heard anything recently about Stanley Hilton's suit?
[00:41:30.114 --> 00:41:30.914]  I have been trying.
[00:41:31.535 --> 00:41:35.517]  What happened is last time I talked to Hilton, he's a busy trial lawyer.
[00:41:36.269 --> 00:41:39.170]  Bob Knowles, former chief of staff, says Bush carried out 9-1-1.
[00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:41.591]  Yeah, he says Bin Laden's dead.
[00:41:41.851 --> 00:41:44.152]  Yeah, I'm just trying to give people background.
[00:41:44.332 --> 00:41:44.952]  What did you just say?
[00:41:45.833 --> 00:41:50.574]  Actually, Stanley Hilton says that Bin Laden has been dead for quite some time.
[00:41:51.715 --> 00:41:53.796]  That was Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[00:41:54.856 --> 00:41:59.658]  Actually, I have an article that says Stanley Hilton mentioned that.
[00:42:00.396 --> 00:42:09.507]  Well, he's interviewed a lot of the military people, like Stephen Butler, the colonel that said Bush was behind 9-1-1, and the news just carried his quote.
[00:42:09.888 --> 00:42:16.296]  They didn't tell the people that Butler was forced to train some of the hijackers as the dean of the school.
[00:42:17.157 --> 00:42:19.820]  See, they lie by omission.
[00:42:21.167 --> 00:42:22.368]  But thanks for the call, Mark.
[00:42:22.388 --> 00:42:23.088]  Really good points.
[00:42:23.328 --> 00:42:26.890]  And when I jump in on you like that, you made a lot of good points.
[00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:34.354]  I'm not trying to prove I know all the answers and I remember all the news, because I get emails occasionally going, you're trying to be a show-off.
[00:42:34.574 --> 00:42:39.197]  No, my brain moves quick sometimes, and I'm just trying to give people the data.
[00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:48.242]  Because I don't want somebody tuning in to think, oh, these guys are just saying that they're making this up about the fairies being in danger.
[00:42:48.362 --> 00:42:49.623]  No, I want to show you
[00:42:50.658 --> 00:42:56.123]  How it's a federal plan to take over everything and have federalized forces, including U.S.
[00:42:56.283 --> 00:43:04.069]  Army, in every town, on every street corner, and make you serve in a national draft here domestically.
[00:43:04.149 --> 00:43:05.730]  And it'll have nothing to do with terror.
[00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:10.894]  They're going to search your cars, take your guns, while the border stays wide open.
[00:43:12.796 --> 00:43:15.058]  But yes, thank you for mentioning the ferries, Mark.
[00:43:15.078 --> 00:43:15.838]  Really good point.
[00:43:16.819 --> 00:43:18.020]  That's very important.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.002]  I saw them announcing that a couple days ago.
[00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.311]  Never got around to mentioning it, yes.
[00:43:24.311 --> 00:43:28.254]  And again, all these federal programs were about to be scaled back.
[00:43:28.334 --> 00:43:30.695]  That is, they'd already grown massively.
[00:43:30.995 --> 00:43:32.696]  They wanted even more funding.
[00:43:32.756 --> 00:43:40.140]  You know, $100 billion a year wasn't enough for all the anti-terror stuff, on top of all the funding they had from years past.
[00:43:41.961 --> 00:43:50.206]  But the $100 billion increase wasn't enough, and so they wanted more, and Congress said, hey, look, we're already running a giant deficit here.
[00:43:51.065 --> 00:43:53.947]  The actual debt is at $43.2 trillion.
[00:43:54.527 --> 00:43:56.409]  That's right, that's the Dallas Morning News' numbers.
[00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:00.231]  And suddenly reports, they're going to get our ferries.
[00:44:00.451 --> 00:44:02.173]  There's hijackings about to happen again.
[00:44:02.213 --> 00:44:06.996]  And Congress said last night, okay, okay, we'll do what you say.
[00:44:07.156 --> 00:44:08.977]  See, that's terrorism, folks.
[00:44:09.878 --> 00:44:15.121]  When the agencies, the bureaucracy says, give us more funds or the terrorists are going to get you.
[00:44:15.482 --> 00:44:17.363]  That's the definition of terrorism.
[00:44:18.334 --> 00:44:20.455]  Put the money in the bag or the girl dies.
[00:44:20.475 --> 00:44:23.256]  You know, the black ski mask, they even wear the black ski mask.
[00:44:23.276 --> 00:44:25.797]  I mean, look at a terrorist when you see one, folks.
[00:44:25.857 --> 00:44:27.338]  It's hidden right in front of you.
[00:44:27.958 --> 00:44:31.239]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kim in Colorado.
[00:44:31.279 --> 00:44:32.180]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.400]  Hi, Alex.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:48.006]  I just wanted to say it's an honor to be able to talk to you because I think you're a very intelligent man and you're one of the few people in the country, there are a couple, but you're one of the few people in the country that have the intestinal fortitude to stand up
[00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:52.252]  And say the truth and just tell it the way it is.
[00:44:53.352 --> 00:44:58.915]  Now, have you ever considered giving any seminars in the Colorado Springs area?
[00:44:59.295 --> 00:45:08.260]  And another question, obviously no one can withstand a direct frontal assault by the federal government.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.221]  I mean, they've got more than enough firepower.
[00:45:10.481 --> 00:45:14.763]  What can we do to prepare our family a retreat,
[00:45:15.464 --> 00:45:16.646]  Food, whatever.
[00:45:17.587 --> 00:45:20.451]  We're talking tactical survival situations here.
[00:45:20.631 --> 00:45:24.397]  Are you going to produce a video in the future to help people out?
[00:45:25.258 --> 00:45:26.079]  What can we do?
[00:45:26.179 --> 00:45:27.060]  It's going to happen.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.182]  It's going to take place.
[00:45:29.043 --> 00:45:32.388]  Because right now, the way things look...
[00:45:33.157 --> 00:45:38.419]  There's not a whole heck of a lot the individual person, individual family member can do.
[00:45:38.579 --> 00:45:40.860]  Our voting doesn't seem to count.
[00:45:41.461 --> 00:45:45.822]  Giving money to certain organizations doesn't seem to do anything.
[00:45:46.203 --> 00:45:55.266]  The corruption is so great and so vast, the only thing that can help is the Lord God can come in and wipe the slate clean again.
[00:45:56.287 --> 00:46:00.989]  Well, look, number one, sir, is it Kim or Tim?
[00:46:01.727 --> 00:46:02.587]  Kim, K-I-M.
[00:46:02.968 --> 00:46:03.468]  Great, good.
[00:46:03.488 --> 00:46:04.649]  I got that right.
[00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:09.091]  I appreciate your compliments, but I'm not the leader.
[00:46:10.592 --> 00:46:11.132]  Exactly.
[00:46:11.752 --> 00:46:12.833]  I mean, I would say this.
[00:46:13.293 --> 00:46:16.294]  Number one, I was never in Special Forces.
[00:46:17.295 --> 00:46:18.596]  I'm not a survivalist.
[00:46:19.256 --> 00:46:20.356]  Certainly, you know, I'm a...
[00:46:22.159 --> 00:46:28.544]  I'm from farm boy background here in Texas, so I know how to camp and shoot a deer and run a trout line and a country boy can't survive.
[00:46:28.905 --> 00:46:29.805]  That whole line.
[00:46:30.446 --> 00:46:34.469]  But there are a lot of great videos, a lot of great books on survival out there.
[00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:35.390]  Right.
[00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:36.871]  I've got all that taken care of.
[00:46:36.951 --> 00:46:37.492]  I know that.
[00:46:37.592 --> 00:46:38.633]  I was in the military.
[00:46:38.693 --> 00:46:41.175]  I know what I'm doing as far as tactical survival goes.
[00:46:41.655 --> 00:46:44.637]  Sure, but what about preparing a family?
[00:46:44.858 --> 00:46:46.559]  I don't understand.
[00:46:46.599 --> 00:46:46.939]  Go ahead.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.821]  I'm talking about preparedness.
[00:46:49.221 --> 00:46:49.962]  What would you...
[00:46:50.976 --> 00:46:58.692]  Do for your family to prepare for the government takeover so we can basically stay out of mainstream.
[00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:22.121]  Well, you see, the problem is once Christians and patriots, if they succeed, are all isolated in the countryside, they'll have federal death squads that'll do a truck bomb in the downtown of the city, claim that the anti-establishment people did it, and then the mindless local cops will carry out seek-and-destroy operations
[00:47:22.981 --> 00:47:23.502]  We're good to go.
[00:47:49.321 --> 00:47:51.465]  So, you know, this gets into the enemy's whole operational system.
[00:48:00.117 --> 00:48:02.879]  So the answer is we can't survive a frontal assault.
[00:48:02.899 --> 00:48:04.540]  Well, individually we can't.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.582]  But we're in the minds of those helicopter pilots.
[00:48:08.702 --> 00:48:12.204]  We're in the minds and the hearts of those police officers.
[00:48:12.504 --> 00:48:23.870]  We need to show them the facts of the treason, show them who the real terrorists are, show them the plan so they won't go along with it if the globalists are dumb enough to go ahead and activate the next phase.
[00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:24.430]  Stay there.
[00:48:25.214 --> 00:48:26.796]  Kim, it's a very important question.
[00:48:26.836 --> 00:48:30.619]  I'll try to answer it, and then we'll talk to Jonathan, Rhonda, and Tommy, and others.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.884]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:48:36.065 --> 00:48:40.489]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:48:40.649 --> 00:48:45.033]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:48:45.133 --> 00:48:46.395]  A New World Order.
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:52.405]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:48:52.465 --> 00:48:59.393]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:48:59.534 --> 00:49:01.596]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:49:01.916 --> 00:49:04.920]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:12.342]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:49:12.522 --> 00:49:17.884]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:49:18.404 --> 00:49:21.045]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:49:21.145 --> 00:49:21.905]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:22.385]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:49:22.405 --> 00:49:23.446]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:49:31.562 --> 00:49:33.523]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:49:33.623 --> 00:49:34.263]  Hello, folks.
[00:49:34.403 --> 00:49:44.327]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:49:44.707 --> 00:49:49.229]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:49:49.289 --> 00:50:00.633]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:50:01.213 --> 00:50:08.057]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:50:08.457 --> 00:50:10.599]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:50:11.099 --> 00:50:16.082]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[00:50:16.382 --> 00:50:22.525]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-7000.
[00:50:23.766 --> 00:50:24.427]  We're good to go.
[00:50:40.425 --> 00:50:44.208]  Medicare and Medicaid may pay for your diabetes testing supplies.
[00:50:44.469 --> 00:50:48.572]  And if that's of interest to you, you need to know about R-Tex Medical.
[00:50:48.892 --> 00:50:53.056]  We'll ship your diabetes supplies right to your door at no cost to you.
[00:50:53.516 --> 00:51:00.242]  And we work with Medicare and Medicaid and even most private insurances to determine your maximum coverage benefits.
[00:51:00.282 --> 00:51:00.322]  800-419-2335
[00:51:31.111 --> 00:51:45.082]  I'll tell you what the overriding force is on this broadcast a lot of the time.
[00:51:45.142 --> 00:51:46.323]  It's my frustration.
[00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:58.333]  The amount of knowledge, the amount of study I've done, again, it's like a fire hose under high pressure and somebody will ask me a question and
[00:51:59.564 --> 00:52:16.533]  And to try to give them a proper answer, it's like trying in the time we have to fit all the information in that fire hose that's blasting under high pressure, under maximum pressure, through the type of straw you use to stir your coffee, one of those little bitty straws.
[00:52:16.573 --> 00:52:19.575]  I mean, volumes of books.
[00:52:19.855 --> 00:52:26.899]  You could have master's degree studies on how to stop a tyrannical government
[00:52:27.839 --> 00:52:40.906]  From taking over a society when it has been doing it for generations and just incrementally expanding its sway and control, kind of like a university system grows over time.
[00:52:41.946 --> 00:52:55.773]  Just the study of institutional organized crime that becomes so powerful, it becomes the establishment and then declares all those that are not its minions enemies of the state.
[00:52:56.778 --> 00:52:58.299]  I mean, he asked, how do we get ready?
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.081]  We're in a death grip with the New World Order.
[00:53:02.562 --> 00:53:17.554]  I mean, we got on the air, we exposed the smallpox as deadly, top epidemiologists who weren't in the globalist loop went public about how dangerous it was, and 99 plus percent of firemen, police, medical workers refused the shot.
[00:53:17.634 --> 00:53:26.401]  So the globalists are going to have trouble going ahead with a smallpox attack and then having their medical workers forcibly inject us
[00:53:27.319 --> 00:53:32.543]  And again, all of that is just to create bedlam so they can have the martial law cracked down.
[00:53:32.623 --> 00:53:33.964]  And they've said that's what it's about.
[00:53:34.708 --> 00:53:42.653]  The FEMA guy in New Jersey, Sid Casperson, said in the Gannett News Service that you'll be an enemy of the government under red alert.
[00:53:42.993 --> 00:53:44.214]  No one can leave their house.
[00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:45.615]  All your rights are stripped.
[00:53:45.995 --> 00:53:46.916]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:53:46.996 --> 00:53:49.017]  Life will be different from now on.
[00:53:49.317 --> 00:53:52.419]  You're going to have to live in emergency cities, maybe forever.
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.121]  They're setting it up, folks.
[00:53:55.161 --> 00:53:56.822]  You go, why would they want to do that?
[00:53:57.222 --> 00:53:59.684]  Because the globalists are ruthless, and they're bored.
[00:53:59.744 --> 00:54:00.244]  This is like
[00:54:01.152 --> 00:54:02.033]  We're good to go.
[00:54:02.053 --> 00:54:02.213]  I think?
[00:54:29.404 --> 00:54:38.246]  And they've given out questionnaires to the Army and the Marines and everybody else, and most of them have said, 76% have said, no, I won't shoot on Americans or take their guns.
[00:54:38.306 --> 00:54:40.607]  So they've signed deals of bringing foreign troops.
[00:54:40.867 --> 00:54:41.907]  That's mainstream news.
[00:54:42.988 --> 00:54:43.848]  They've signed the deals.
[00:54:44.228 --> 00:54:49.349]  They're hiring felons, illegal aliens, to be in the military now, just like Stalin did.
[00:54:49.369 --> 00:54:50.970]  I mean, it's the same pattern, folks.
[00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:53.610]  So you say, how do we protect ourselves?
[00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:55.451]  We get involved politically now.
[00:54:56.417 --> 00:54:57.157]  I think we're good to go.
[00:55:20.419 --> 00:55:29.148]  And maybe 100 people called in to disagree, 150 maybe, out of 5, 6, 7, I don't know, tens of thousands that have called in who agree.
[00:55:29.728 --> 00:55:32.551]  I mean, here's this show right now on AM and FM all over the place.
[00:55:32.811 --> 00:55:34.153]  Where are the people that disagree?
[00:55:34.854 --> 00:55:36.956]  It's an incredible rarity when they call.
[00:55:37.977 --> 00:55:39.038]  So we're winning the fight.
[00:55:39.118 --> 00:55:41.220]  I mean, they can claim all day that we're buying it.
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:44.183]  That is Tokyo Rose propaganda.
[00:55:46.388 --> 00:55:55.515]  You know, I didn't plug my videos this hour, and that's how we support the broadcast and what we do, and they are professionally produced, and they are informative, and they are waking up 90% of those that see them.
[00:55:55.535 --> 00:56:05.203]  So I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order the videos, or I hope you'll call toll-free at 888-253-3139 to get them.
[00:56:05.223 --> 00:56:10.327]  My films break it all down in a calm, orderly fashion.
[00:56:13.226 --> 00:56:14.027]  I just hope you'll get them.
[00:56:14.447 --> 00:56:19.550]  All right, I'm going to talk more about how to get the country back later in the next hour, but we'll come back and take calls right now.
[00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:22.092]  Hello, folks.
[00:56:22.152 --> 00:56:25.014]  Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey replacement elements.
[00:56:25.294 --> 00:56:28.796]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:56:28.876 --> 00:56:38.563]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.222 --> 00:56:47.862]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.522 --> 00:56:49.542]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.282 --> 00:56:51.383]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.043 --> 00:56:52.863]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.624 --> 00:56:54.524]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.564 --> 00:56:58.885]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.365 --> 00:57:03.487]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:04.667 --> 00:57:09.568]  We have one phone line open if you'd like to join us on air.
[00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:11.029]  It's 800-259-9231.
[00:57:15.265 --> 00:57:15.565]  800-259-9231.
[00:57:15.645 --> 00:57:28.689]  Mark in Minnesota brought up really great points about how the government isn't getting all the funding it wants, so it releases new terror alert threats in just the key areas they want increased funding.
[00:57:30.009 --> 00:57:40.152]  And how they're expanding the federal sweep and control of not just having troops and bureaucrats in the airports, but now the buses and the toll roads and the ferries.
[00:57:41.932 --> 00:57:43.473]  Federalizing America and...
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:58.825]  Tim in Colorado talked about how do we stop the globalists from taking over, or if they do take over and start the arrest of Christians for execution or to be worked to death, which is their plan, by the way.
[00:57:59.725 --> 00:58:02.266]  I mean real Christians, those that don't take the chip.
[00:58:03.107 --> 00:58:04.888]  And that's the plan, by the way.
[00:58:05.188 --> 00:58:05.789]  I'll get into that.
[00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:08.990]  I'll talk about solutions and how to fight this system coming up.
[00:58:09.431 --> 00:58:12.632]  Right now, let's go to Jonathan, Rhonda, Tommy, John, and others.
[00:58:12.892 --> 00:58:15.694]  Jonathan in Colorado, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:58:16.774 --> 00:58:18.555]  Jonathan just hung up when I was going to him.
[00:58:19.076 --> 00:58:19.596]  That's funny.
[00:58:20.016 --> 00:58:20.757]  That always happens.
[00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:24.399]  Rhonda in Missouri, you're on the air.
[00:58:24.439 --> 00:58:24.839]  Go ahead.
[00:58:24.859 --> 00:58:25.799]  Hi, Alex.
[00:58:26.059 --> 00:58:26.880]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:27.340]  How are you doing?
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:28.821]  I'm doing good.
[00:58:28.901 --> 00:58:30.542]  I just got back from a...
[00:58:31.226 --> 00:58:31.966]  We're good to go.
[00:58:31.986 --> 00:58:32.947]  I think?
[00:58:57.196 --> 00:58:59.658]  We talked about that a little bit.
[00:58:59.918 --> 00:59:01.058]  They didn't have much to say.
[00:59:01.259 --> 00:59:14.627]  I just told them that with the dying corps and all the children they kidnapped, I said, in good conscience, I can't go along with these things.
[00:59:14.947 --> 00:59:17.929]  We all got to do what we got to do.
[00:59:18.369 --> 00:59:19.389]  They know how I feel.
[00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:25.193]  They didn't really have a whole lot to say, but like I said, it's the seed that you plant.
[00:59:25.942 --> 00:59:30.626]  And I think that's the most important thing that we can do is plant those seeds one at a time.
[00:59:31.006 --> 00:59:39.173]  And I pray that I have the courage when the time comes to do the right thing, whether it's at a checkpoint, whether it's wherever I'm at, at a check outline.
[00:59:39.353 --> 00:59:40.434]  We're the majority.
[00:59:40.574 --> 00:59:45.939]  And if we were leaders and if we didn't go along with this stuff, the globalists couldn't get away with it.
[00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:51.904]  And then the peer pressure mass out there would see us standing up and would join us.
[00:59:52.244 --> 00:59:53.345]  That's how it works.
[00:59:53.545 --> 00:59:54.066]  Exactly.
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:58.262]  And, you know, one at a time, you know, united we stand, divided we fall.
[00:59:58.302 --> 01:00:02.264]  And, you know, if everybody at checkpoints said, okay, where's your probable cause?
[01:00:02.284 --> 01:00:04.706]  You know, what are they going to do, haul out 1,000 tow trucks?
[01:00:04.966 --> 01:00:11.890]  Yeah, and, you know, them and the poor dumb cop says, well, you know, 911, things have changed.
[01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:13.331]  It's for your safety.
[01:00:13.351 --> 01:00:15.212]  You say, well, why is the border still wide open?
[01:00:15.252 --> 01:00:15.492]  Exactly.
[01:00:15.512 --> 01:00:16.873]  That's exactly what I told my friends.
[01:00:16.953 --> 01:00:19.374]  I said, you guys run these checkpoints right here in the middle of the country.
[01:00:19.969 --> 01:00:21.430]  And the borders are wide open.
[01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:24.493]  And I told them about the matricula cards.
[01:00:24.513 --> 01:00:27.635]  800 cities except fake ID cards.
[01:00:28.095 --> 01:00:34.480]  We had the president of the Colorado Senate on, and he was in the newspaper.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:37.362]  They just went out and bought, what, three or four of these.
[01:00:37.883 --> 01:00:42.566]  This guy had the same name, and they would just give them to him and have different names.
[01:00:42.626 --> 01:00:43.387]  It's a joke.
[01:00:44.448 --> 01:00:44.708]  It is.
[01:00:44.848 --> 01:00:46.109]  It's a sick joke.
[01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:47.110]  And...
[01:00:47.864 --> 01:00:50.325]  You know, we just have to have the courage, the faith.
[01:00:50.385 --> 01:00:52.887]  You know, if we knew where we was going, where would it lie, the faith?
[01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:56.309]  And, you know, faith has to be forged like the steel of a knife.
[01:00:56.349 --> 01:01:01.672]  And things, just like things ain't always what they seem on the bad side, things ain't always what they seem on the good side.
[01:01:01.692 --> 01:01:11.677]  Sometimes when it looks like everything's against you, I pray that I know that faith tells me things can change in an instant for the good.
[01:01:11.697 --> 01:01:12.497]  They are.
[01:01:12.618 --> 01:01:15.019]  I mean, look, Poindexter had to resign.
[01:01:15.888 --> 01:01:19.471]  They couldn't get Kissinger as the head of the 9-1-1 commission.
[01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:23.734]  That shows how delusional they are.
[01:01:24.134 --> 01:01:29.177]  I mean, they really, in their ivory towers, they've lost touch.
[01:01:30.358 --> 01:01:37.343]  And I don't think they're reading all the reports, Rhonda, from their psychological warfare chiefs.
[01:01:38.244 --> 01:01:39.785]  I don't think they're following the plan.
[01:01:39.825 --> 01:01:40.205]  Stay there.
[01:01:40.245 --> 01:01:41.066]  I'll come back to you.
[01:01:42.569 --> 01:01:50.836]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:01:51.097 --> 01:01:55.440]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:01:55.741 --> 01:02:04.649]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:02:04.869 --> 01:02:08.492]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:02:08.772 --> 01:02:09.453]  What about you?
[01:02:22.612 --> 01:02:27.958]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:02:28.018 --> 01:02:29.180]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.082]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:02:43.371 --> 01:02:50.753]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:51.034 --> 01:02:55.775]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.995 --> 01:03:01.637]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.877 --> 01:03:06.400]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:13.785]  The casual society control grid, impalpable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:03:13.805 --> 01:03:18.348]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:03:18.508 --> 01:03:21.009]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:27.954]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:03:28.194 --> 01:03:33.438]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:33.878]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:42.631 --> 01:03:42.771]  Call 800-348-4100.
[01:03:42.791 --> 01:03:42.971]  That's 800-348-4100.
[01:04:12.597 --> 01:04:13.517]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[01:04:13.557 --> 01:04:20.738]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year, and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[01:04:20.998 --> 01:04:23.919]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[01:04:24.119 --> 01:04:29.800]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.580]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[01:04:34.541 --> 01:04:39.021]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[01:04:42.634 --> 01:04:50.379]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:04:54.982 --> 01:04:56.643]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:57.904 --> 01:05:01.826]  Thanks for joining us today, and yeah, it's a scary show.
[01:05:02.046 --> 01:05:10.992]  We talk about a lot of painful things, and you might think that you'll just be safer if you just deny what I'm saying and ignore what I'm covering, but
[01:05:11.593 --> 01:05:12.514]  There's a problem.
[01:05:12.774 --> 01:05:15.676]  A lot of you have been listening to this show for eight, nine years.
[01:05:17.177 --> 01:05:19.719]  Quite a bit of you have been listening for three or four years.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:34.631]  Millions of you that tune in from time to time heard me on dozens of shows predict September 11th, say the government was going to use Bin Laden to attack New York, that he would take the blame, that he was a CIA asset.
[01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:37.053]  I mean, how did I do that?
[01:05:37.073 --> 01:05:37.994]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:05:38.114 --> 01:05:39.535]  I wish I was wrong, okay?
[01:05:40.678 --> 01:05:41.999]  I'm concerned about my family.
[01:05:42.059 --> 01:05:43.280]  I'm concerned about this country.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.961]  I'm mad at the globalists.
[01:05:45.422 --> 01:05:46.983]  I hate their guts.
[01:05:47.203 --> 01:05:50.285]  I know about their crimes, their admitted crimes.
[01:05:50.365 --> 01:05:57.891]  And I'm begging you to just do research, to just think back in your mind, to sit in a dark room for an hour.
[01:06:00.034 --> 01:06:00.735]  We're good to go.
[01:06:00.755 --> 01:06:00.895]  I think?
[01:06:21.034 --> 01:06:21.775]  We're good to go.
[01:06:36.617 --> 01:06:40.520]  You know about porting down killing U.S.
[01:06:40.581 --> 01:06:44.524]  troops with chemicals and biologicals even in the mid-1980s.
[01:06:45.024 --> 01:06:47.026]  Or if you don't know about that, you better research it.
[01:06:47.366 --> 01:06:50.469]  You know the crimes go on and on and on.
[01:06:50.929 --> 01:07:03.460]  Every time I open the paper up, it's a police chief or a deputy sheriff or a CPS worker in some child kidnapping ring or abuse or it's government in money laundering or embezzlement.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.662]  Criminals are smart, folks.
[01:07:05.762 --> 01:07:07.383]  The smart ones are smart.
[01:07:07.743 --> 01:07:12.988]  And they go and they get into government so they have the badge, so they have the cloak of anonymity.
[01:07:14.893 --> 01:07:17.014]  And somehow we just trust them.
[01:07:17.414 --> 01:07:19.295]  We just go along with whatever they say.
[01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:20.616]  And, oh, you're the authority.
[01:07:21.176 --> 01:07:25.218]  Our founding fathers said that government is the most dangerous thing around.
[01:07:25.579 --> 01:07:33.022]  It always becomes corrupt if you do not restrict the size of it and if you do not stay on it 24 hours a day.
[01:07:33.543 --> 01:07:35.984]  And what you've got is 90% of the cops are good.
[01:07:36.004 --> 01:07:36.944]  99.9% of the firemen are good.
[01:07:36.964 --> 01:07:39.606]  Probably 60% of the FBI is good.
[01:07:44.759 --> 01:07:46.660]  About 5% of the BATFs good.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.040]  I'm serious, folks.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:48.640]  I've studied them.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.041]  But most people in government are good.
[01:07:51.121 --> 01:07:52.501]  Most CIA is good.
[01:07:53.261 --> 01:07:55.222]  I've talked to people who have been in the CIA.
[01:07:55.562 --> 01:07:57.242]  I know people who have been in the CIA.
[01:07:57.542 --> 01:07:59.703]  I've had families who have been involved with the CIA.
[01:08:00.803 --> 01:08:08.665]  And, you know, they were off in some compartmentalized area thinking they were doing good, and they always learned later they were doing wrong.
[01:08:09.272 --> 01:08:09.872]  Yes, can you hear me?
[01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:41.580]  And for stations that carry the news and didn't hear the last segment, repeat what you just said in the last segment, and then I'm going to move on to other callers.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:52.246]  I just told, they were talking about running their checkpoints, you know, have to work their checkpoints, and talking about going maybe on somewhere next year, and if I wanted to go, and I said, well, if I'm not in jail, maybe.
[01:08:52.845 --> 01:08:53.585]  Why would you be in jail?
[01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:56.966]  I said, because you better have probable cause to want to see my papers.
[01:08:57.326 --> 01:09:01.207]  I said, it sounds like Nazi Germany to me when you've got to stop at checkpoints.
[01:09:01.247 --> 01:09:02.767]  Here you run checkpoints in the middle of the country.
[01:09:02.807 --> 01:09:03.788]  The borders are wide open.
[01:09:03.808 --> 01:09:05.488]  I said, that don't make no sense.
[01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:10.509]  We've got our troops halfway around the world huffing in uranium, bringing it back.
[01:09:10.529 --> 01:09:11.490]  Their skin is falling off.
[01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:16.611]  Right here in this state, one of our guys came back and died from God knows what.
[01:09:16.751 --> 01:09:18.971]  His parents couldn't touch him before he died.
[01:09:21.317 --> 01:09:22.858]  I told him about DynCorp.
[01:09:22.898 --> 01:09:24.398]  I told him about Bohemian Grove.
[01:09:24.458 --> 01:09:28.520]  I told him as much as I could tell him in little bits at a time.
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:33.302]  It definitely, I think, gave him something to think about.
[01:09:33.322 --> 01:09:36.483]  Basically, what I told him is how I feel and what I'm going to do.
[01:09:37.183 --> 01:09:38.384]  We all have to make choices.
[01:09:38.484 --> 01:09:40.585]  Options will be presented and choices will be made.
[01:09:40.605 --> 01:09:44.706]  I want to make the right choice.
[01:09:44.806 --> 01:09:46.047]  I want to make the choice for good.
[01:09:46.167 --> 01:09:48.708]  The choice for good is standing up for individual sovereignty.
[01:09:49.087 --> 01:09:49.408]  Thank you.
[01:09:57.435 --> 01:09:59.496]  To get the American people to fall for it.
[01:09:59.596 --> 01:10:00.737]  People are deceived.
[01:10:00.757 --> 01:10:02.278]  People have good hearts, but they've been deceived.
[01:10:02.518 --> 01:10:03.138]  Exactly.
[01:10:03.579 --> 01:10:05.900]  The Pan-American Union has been set up.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.101]  We're losing American sovereignty.
[01:10:08.502 --> 01:10:10.583]  Our military is going under joint command.
[01:10:11.043 --> 01:10:17.867]  And 95% of people, Rhonda, have no idea about a massive historical move.
[01:10:17.967 --> 01:10:20.329]  And they go, wait, it's just a free trade deal.
[01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:24.697]  Folks, that's what they called the EU 25 years ago.
[01:10:24.717 --> 01:10:31.169]  And under the guise of trade deals, they merged the Social Security, the governments, everything.
[01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:33.393]  And it's been announced.
[01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:41.014]  That America is going to be rolled into Canada and Mexico and then into Central and South America.
[01:10:41.535 --> 01:10:42.756]  It's official.
[01:10:43.176 --> 01:10:44.897]  It's official we're going to pay U.N.
[01:10:44.957 --> 01:10:47.560]  taxes on our bank accounts, on our cars.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.741]  That's what I told them about the black boxes in the cars.
[01:10:49.762 --> 01:10:52.484]  I told them about their plans for the hardened checkpoints on the roads.
[01:10:52.564 --> 01:10:53.625]  It's all about conditioning.
[01:10:53.965 --> 01:10:55.886]  We are under psychological warfare.
[01:10:56.106 --> 01:10:57.446]  And Rhonda, here's my frustration.
[01:10:57.846 --> 01:11:00.827]  I have all the official government documents.
[01:11:00.907 --> 01:11:01.907]  None of this is hidden.
[01:11:02.107 --> 01:11:02.687]  I know it, Alex.
[01:11:02.767 --> 01:11:03.788]  Can I ask you one more thing?
[01:11:03.808 --> 01:11:09.189]  I'm going to get to sit down with a congressman personally and ask him questions.
[01:11:09.389 --> 01:11:15.411]  What would be some of the most important questions that you could ask to demand answers for?
[01:11:16.201 --> 01:11:32.631]  Well, number one, I would tell him, you're not stupid enough to go along with this con-con the CFR Commission just called for, where they want Congress to give up its authority to the president and the 50 governors so that they can, quote, appoint the new Congress.
[01:11:32.651 --> 01:11:38.875]  I mean, that is asking for Congress to get attacked during a quorum call.
[01:11:40.061 --> 01:11:48.127]  I mean, that's like leaving the keys in the bank door at night with the access code of the vault and then putting an ad in the paper.
[01:11:48.567 --> 01:12:02.197]  I'm telling, we don't want a con-con because that endangers you, and at the same time, don't allow a con-con, a constitutional convention, because they can rewrite the whole Bill of Rights during one of those.
[01:12:02.678 --> 01:12:04.479]  I mean, if they pass that amendment...
[01:12:06.312 --> 01:12:18.023]  They pass a law to move to see if they can get a con-con with two-thirds of the states, and they're trying to pat the CFR, the same folks that said, terrorists coming, give your rights up.
[01:12:18.063 --> 01:12:21.647]  You know, we need to use this disaster for a new world order.
[01:12:21.807 --> 01:12:23.128]  Terrorists, didn't you mean?
[01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:24.069]  Yeah, the terrorists.
[01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:28.153]  I mean, that's scary, folks.
[01:12:28.493 --> 01:12:30.235]  And I would tell him...
[01:12:31.127 --> 01:12:46.998]  That whatever you do, 80-plus percent of the American people, but it doesn't matter what they think, to people in Washington, but 80-plus percent in major polls want the borders shut and illegals deported, including a majority of Hispanics.
[01:12:47.018 --> 01:12:48.879]  They try to make it a racial issue, but it's not.
[01:12:48.899 --> 01:12:51.420]  It's an economic issue and a sovereignty issue.
[01:12:52.221 --> 01:12:54.502]  And you say that's important to say.
[01:12:54.763 --> 01:12:59.646]  Do not pass the assault weapons ban so Bush can sign it again.
[01:13:00.703 --> 01:13:07.046]  And I would also mention the fact that, I mean, there's a lot of different issues.
[01:13:07.546 --> 01:13:07.886]  I know.
[01:13:07.906 --> 01:13:09.167]  There's a lot.
[01:13:09.587 --> 01:13:10.527]  That's just some of them.
[01:13:10.547 --> 01:13:12.228]  Maybe the listeners can suggest what you say.
[01:13:12.248 --> 01:13:16.590]  I thought I was going to ask him what made him think he could sign something.
[01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:18.571]  Why did he sign something he didn't read?
[01:13:18.591 --> 01:13:20.452]  Oh, you mean the Patriot Act.
[01:13:20.472 --> 01:13:20.552]  Yeah.
[01:13:20.572 --> 01:13:20.852]  Yeah.
[01:13:20.872 --> 01:13:26.154]  Well, I mean, I don't think he'd think too much of me if I signed a contract before I read it.
[01:13:26.694 --> 01:13:30.196]  Well, you see, they pass hundreds of thousands of pages a month.
[01:13:31.212 --> 01:13:32.914]  Then that shows you right there government's too big.
[01:13:33.454 --> 01:13:35.916]  Well, there's over 30 million federal laws.
[01:13:37.838 --> 01:13:40.941]  And they say there's over... This sounds ridiculous.
[01:13:40.961 --> 01:13:42.022]  This is an official number.
[01:13:42.623 --> 01:13:47.307]  There is over 100 million state laws, and no one has ever counted the number of local laws.
[01:13:48.388 --> 01:13:50.450]  So they say ignorance of the law is no excuse.
[01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:54.013]  Yeah, that's the Magna Carta when there were 10 laws.
[01:13:56.896 --> 01:13:57.056]  So...
[01:13:58.877 --> 01:14:00.498]  I mean, we're all breaking laws every day.
[01:14:00.638 --> 01:14:02.139]  There's no way to keep track of any of this.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:02.960]  It's just like New York.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:10.246]  Now they're arresting people like they put the ad in the paper to apologize to the public because now they're being told to arrest people for bringing out all these laws.
[01:14:10.286 --> 01:14:14.929]  That's why I told my friends, too, just on the prisons, they're building these factories.
[01:14:15.810 --> 01:14:21.574]  I said, we're either all going to work for, be in law enforcement, be in prison, or work for Halliburton.
[01:14:23.415 --> 01:14:25.917]  Well, look at Iraq, Rhonda.
[01:14:25.957 --> 01:14:28.179]  We have 22 million people
[01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:29.831]  And it's official.
[01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:35.513]  You can't have a job unless the Pentagon signs off, and guess who administers that?
[01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:36.833]  Halliburton.
[01:14:37.373 --> 01:14:39.634]  No bid allowed, by the way, in them being selected.
[01:14:40.494 --> 01:14:46.536]  And they pay, the highest paid engineers and doctors are paid $20 a month.
[01:14:47.856 --> 01:14:51.237]  I bet they love their freedom we've given them.
[01:14:51.797 --> 01:14:53.138]  Yeah, $20 a month, folks.
[01:14:53.258 --> 01:14:56.358]  And the Associated Press two weeks ago had the big article.
[01:14:56.398 --> 01:14:57.619]  It was a positive article.
[01:14:57.639 --> 01:14:58.179]  It was for it.
[01:14:58.835 --> 01:15:03.479]  It said, here are truckloads of men arrested for selling goods on the streets without license.
[01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:08.402]  They were selling radios and beer and posters and knives.
[01:15:08.422 --> 01:15:13.686]  You know, just normal bazaars, and our troops go arrest them because Halliburton gets all the business.
[01:15:13.806 --> 01:15:18.370]  I mean, they're setting up, it makes Stalin's Russia look tamed.
[01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:22.713]  In Stalin's Russia, you could still sell things at little bazaars.
[01:15:22.753 --> 01:15:25.694]  You could keep about 10% of your potatoes.
[01:15:25.975 --> 01:15:28.276]  That's because they didn't have the RFID tracker chips.
[01:15:28.356 --> 01:15:30.237]  We're high-tech tyranny now.
[01:15:30.457 --> 01:15:34.679]  Oh, by the way, yeah, to have a job or to work, they have to wear armbands.
[01:15:34.719 --> 01:15:35.199]  That's right.
[01:15:35.759 --> 01:15:37.420]  Again, and that's how they trace them.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.682]  Anybody in a factory or a business or on the street without the armband is arrested.
[01:15:41.882 --> 01:15:43.443]  They put a hood on their head.
[01:15:43.663 --> 01:15:44.804]  They take them to a camp.
[01:15:45.024 --> 01:15:45.904]  They beat them up.
[01:15:45.964 --> 01:15:46.945]  This is all admitted.
[01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:48.830]  I know.
[01:15:49.551 --> 01:15:54.313]  Like you say, it's so out there in the open and you're so right about the sports diversions.
[01:15:54.353 --> 01:15:57.815]  People just go back and look at history with the coliseums.
[01:15:59.616 --> 01:16:06.339]  It is frustrating to hear these people go on about the most minute things when our country is being torn apart.
[01:16:06.459 --> 01:16:08.020]  Not only the country, but the world.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:12.162]  I believe in sovereignty for the whole world.
[01:16:12.442 --> 01:16:14.703]  Rights are universal, but enforcement should be local.
[01:16:15.436 --> 01:16:16.157]  Absolutely.
[01:16:16.377 --> 01:16:21.702]  It's got to be, you know, you need that sheriff, you need that police chief that's controlled by the elected people.
[01:16:22.123 --> 01:16:24.365]  And look, they're federalizing with all this grant money.
[01:16:24.385 --> 01:16:26.707]  And they go, well, we need this free federal money.
[01:16:27.067 --> 01:16:31.311]  Folks, they take a dollar of it and send you 30 cents back with 100 hooks in it.
[01:16:31.732 --> 01:16:32.552]  Thanks for the call, Rhonda.
[01:16:32.592 --> 01:16:37.277]  I promise I'll come back and go straight to Tommy and John and Ken and John and others.
[01:16:38.438 --> 01:16:39.839]  It's so out of control, folks.
[01:16:39.879 --> 01:16:40.320]  Stay with us.
[01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:45.509]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:51.551]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:16:51.811 --> 01:16:56.952]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:16:57.293 --> 01:17:06.555]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:17:06.915 --> 01:17:11.857]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:17:12.198 --> 01:17:16.220]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:21.142]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:17:21.542 --> 01:17:27.445]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:17:27.785 --> 01:17:32.909]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:17:32.929 --> 01:17:34.571]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:17:34.591 --> 01:17:35.752]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:17:43.668 --> 01:17:45.329]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:17:45.429 --> 01:17:47.891]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:17:48.071 --> 01:17:48.751]  It feels great.
[01:17:48.951 --> 01:17:49.932]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:17:50.052 --> 01:17:55.396]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:17:55.656 --> 01:17:57.397]  I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:17:57.558 --> 01:18:00.720]  I've lost 16 pounds, and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:01.480]  Incredible.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:02.881]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:18:02.901 --> 01:18:06.524]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:18:06.824 --> 01:18:10.286]  Sharon lost 28 pounds with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:18:10.306 --> 01:18:17.070]  I have arthritis and I have a thyroid problem and blood pressure and Vim and Vigor has really been a blessing to me.
[01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:22.934]  I've lost 28 pounds and counting and I thank them very much from the bottom of my heart.
[01:18:23.334 --> 01:18:27.976]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:18:28.297 --> 01:18:29.477]  Call right now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:18:29.517 --> 01:18:30.197]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:18:30.218 --> 01:18:31.138]  $25 off a three-month supply.
[01:18:31.158 --> 01:18:32.359]  So call Vim and Vigor today, 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:18:32.379 --> 01:18:32.999]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:18:43.704 --> 01:18:47.967]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:18:48.408 --> 01:18:52.971]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:18:53.351 --> 01:18:58.215]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:18:58.575 --> 01:19:00.376]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:01.437]  can barely be read.
[01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:02.678]  It has faded that much.
[01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:06.939]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[01:19:07.199 --> 01:19:15.582]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antiqued parchment paper all ready for framing.
[01:19:15.842 --> 01:19:23.705]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95 shipping included.
[01:19:24.005 --> 01:19:27.946]  And as a special gift for ordering now, you will also receive a commemorative U.S.

[01:19:36.093 --> 01:19:37.514]  Don't wait, do it today.
[01:19:37.855 --> 01:19:38.315]  The number 800-686-2237.
[01:19:38.335 --> 01:19:39.396]  Commodities, futures, options.
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:47.621]  We're good to go.
[01:20:10.081 --> 01:20:10.782]  We're good to go.
[01:20:30.422 --> 01:20:33.863]  For a free special market report on the euro currency, call 1-800-348-4100.
[01:20:33.943 --> 01:20:34.143]  That's 1-800-348-4100.
[01:20:34.183 --> 01:20:34.744]  Barclay Financial.
[01:20:34.824 --> 01:20:35.304]  Mr. Result.
[01:20:35.504 --> 01:20:36.644]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:20:36.664 --> 01:20:37.585]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:49.817 --> 01:20:50.377]  All right.
[01:20:51.057 --> 01:20:52.218]  My friends, we're back live.
[01:20:52.238 --> 01:20:53.278]  We're taking a lot of calls.
[01:20:53.358 --> 01:20:58.059]  I am going to get into some of the news here in a minute, but I do enjoy taking your calls on Friday.
[01:20:58.099 --> 01:21:00.640]  And the news does come up via the callers.
[01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:04.621]  A lot of different angles I wouldn't have gotten to that turned out to be very important.
[01:21:05.081 --> 01:21:08.282]  Tommy in Rhode Island listening to us out there, one of our fine affiliates.
[01:21:08.642 --> 01:21:09.623]  What's going on, Tommy?
[01:21:09.643 --> 01:21:10.983]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:21:11.502 --> 01:21:11.902]  Good, sir.
[01:21:12.343 --> 01:21:16.885]  Okay, I don't get to listen to you all the time, so I don't know if you already covered this.
[01:21:16.965 --> 01:21:18.486]  How are you listening to us right now?
[01:21:18.506 --> 01:21:20.107]  On 1320 AM.
[01:21:20.627 --> 01:21:24.810]  Well, that's a wonderful station with great folks, and we're very thankful for that new affiliate.
[01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:25.210]  Go ahead.
[01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.990]  It sure is.
[01:21:26.351 --> 01:21:32.434]  Anyway, last week on O'Reilly, they had his colonel, I don't know what his name is, his so-called military advisor.
[01:21:32.514 --> 01:21:33.515]  Are you familiar with him?
[01:21:35.007 --> 01:21:35.728]  Oliver North?
[01:21:36.008 --> 01:21:36.888]  No, no, no.
[01:21:37.029 --> 01:21:44.834]  I'll have to get the name, but his military advisor on O'Reilly, and they were talking about how our troops went in.
[01:21:44.874 --> 01:21:49.177]  They were looking for a Bat Party official, and they kidnapped his wife and his children.
[01:21:49.337 --> 01:22:01.845]  And they said, we're allowed to kidnap now, and we use people's children as leverage, which violates the Geneva Convention and every canon of a free society.
[01:22:02.481 --> 01:22:08.003]  Yeah, well, I mean, if I remember right, this is what we tried people for in Germany and Japan after World War II.
[01:22:09.483 --> 01:22:11.964]  Sir, it is... Look, look, great point.
[01:22:12.504 --> 01:22:13.344]  Excellent point.
[01:22:14.104 --> 01:22:20.046]  Look, it was wrong when the Vietnamese, the commies, would capture our people and torture them.
[01:22:20.366 --> 01:22:22.007]  But now they've got them on the news.
[01:22:22.047 --> 01:22:25.127]  I've got clips of the news in Police State 3, my new film.
[01:22:25.628 --> 01:22:27.288]  They say how good torture is.
[01:22:27.348 --> 01:22:30.329]  And by the way, why don't we just torture people's children?
[01:22:31.067 --> 01:22:37.873]  And then the Washington Post admitted and the CIA section chief admitted that they are torturing people's children to get answers.
[01:22:37.913 --> 01:22:46.261]  They said that they take them to third-party countries like Egypt and other countries where they're allowed to torture them.
[01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:51.293]  It was Egypt and Jordan and, quote, threaten their wives and children.
[01:22:51.974 --> 01:22:53.935]  And so think how sick that is.
[01:22:54.295 --> 01:22:56.056]  How warped do they think we are?
[01:22:56.096 --> 01:23:03.922]  Well, see, a lot of Americans, Tommy, came out and said, yeah, torture of American citizens, torture of foreigners, torture of suspects, okay.
[01:23:04.342 --> 01:23:08.265]  So then, of course, Poindexter came out and said, okay, let's bet on what U.S.
[01:23:08.305 --> 01:23:09.406]  troops are going to die.
[01:23:10.127 --> 01:23:12.808]  Let's have a speculation market.
[01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:16.031]  See, they think we're that sick, Tommy.
[01:23:16.531 --> 01:23:18.192]  Well, yeah, it's just mind-boggling to me.
[01:23:18.232 --> 01:23:22.834]  I mean, somebody's going to stand up and say these so-called conservatives, all they are is fascist garbage.
[01:23:22.854 --> 01:23:24.194]  I mean, that's what it comes down to.
[01:23:25.115 --> 01:23:29.936]  Well, government's growing at about twice the rate it was under Clinton.
[01:23:31.057 --> 01:23:32.938]  George Bush is protecting Clinton.
[01:23:33.438 --> 01:23:38.080]  Clinton could be indicted right now for pardoning convicted cocaine dealers and money launderers.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.941]  But Bush is protecting him.
[01:23:41.579 --> 01:23:43.800]  Bush is going to sign his assault weapons ban.
[01:23:44.561 --> 01:23:45.762]  They're not conservatives.
[01:23:45.802 --> 01:23:50.525]  They're neocon fascist trash, as you just said.
[01:23:50.665 --> 01:23:51.245]  Exactly.
[01:23:53.086 --> 01:23:53.667]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:23:53.687 --> 01:23:56.188]  We have a guy up here, a National Guard general.
[01:23:56.228 --> 01:24:03.153]  I know it's on your police day three where he was fired because he dared to question the torture that was going on in Guantanamo.
[01:24:03.897 --> 01:24:07.260]  Now, is there any way you can contact him, possibly have him on the show?
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:12.804]  I really tried hard to get Brigadier General Rick Baucus.
[01:24:13.044 --> 01:24:13.304]  Yes.
[01:24:13.685 --> 01:24:14.966]  He lives in Rhode Island.
[01:24:15.126 --> 01:24:15.366]  Yes.
[01:24:16.527 --> 01:24:24.253]  And he was the head, he was the commandant there of Camp X-Ray and the entire Guantanamo base.
[01:24:24.693 --> 01:24:25.214]  That's right.
[01:24:25.354 --> 01:24:27.756]  And he said, I will not torture people.
[01:24:27.816 --> 01:24:30.438]  And he said, besides that, these aren't even Al-Qaeda.
[01:24:30.738 --> 01:24:31.879]  These are young kids.
[01:24:32.888 --> 01:24:43.110]  He said in an Associated Press interview and in a radio interview he did in Rhode Island that I read on air, he said a lot of these people weren't even in the Army.
[01:24:43.210 --> 01:24:44.450]  He said this is shameful.
[01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:47.771]  He said, I refuse to torture them, so they told me to resign.
[01:24:48.471 --> 01:24:50.291]  And then they appointed some new clown.
[01:24:50.311 --> 01:24:54.632]  And again, that story got almost zero attention.
[01:24:55.292 --> 01:24:58.273]  And I would love to get Rick Baucus on and back.
[01:24:59.275 --> 01:25:00.396]  We've tried to get him on.
[01:25:00.416 --> 01:25:04.818]  I know he did an interview in Rhode Island and then got told by the Pentagon to shut up.
[01:25:05.399 --> 01:25:06.579]  Oh, he's been quiet since then.
[01:25:06.599 --> 01:25:09.901]  It was a front-page story for one day, and it disappeared like a rock.
[01:25:10.261 --> 01:25:14.424]  But again, a lot of these neocons will go, you're not a conservative, you're against the tribes, you're for Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:14.684 --> 01:25:18.066]  Is that why generals, brigadier generals, are resigning?
[01:25:19.486 --> 01:25:19.747]  Oh, yeah.
[01:25:19.787 --> 01:25:20.688]  But good people are saying no.
[01:25:36.627 --> 01:25:37.227]  Absolutely.
[01:25:37.487 --> 01:25:39.628]  But, yeah, you're in Rhode Island.
[01:25:39.648 --> 01:25:54.271]  It was a big story in Rhode Island, but it was in a few of your papers, but it was only in the AP once, and there was a text of the radio interview he did on one of your local stations, and the guy, from according to the article, almost started crying on the air.
[01:25:55.431 --> 01:26:00.733]  I mean, you know, real men aren't bullies that torture people in pens.
[01:26:01.333 --> 01:26:06.194]  No, no, there was another one also on a few weeks ago where one of the environmental troops up there
[01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:14.536]  He was on, I think it was MSNBC, I'm not sure, and he was saying, well, they thought we wouldn't kill little kids over here, but we proved them wrong.
[01:26:14.717 --> 01:26:15.637]  Do you remember that one?
[01:26:16.718 --> 01:26:19.200]  Yeah, I had the British doctor on.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:21.122]  The troops had just killed some children.
[01:26:21.162 --> 01:26:22.243]  He said, how dare you?
[01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:25.185]  And the Marines said, I love killing children!
[01:26:27.187 --> 01:26:28.368]  I'm proud to be an American.
[01:26:28.388 --> 01:26:31.310]  Keep flying those little flags on the back of your cars.
[01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:32.391]  That's all I can say, Alex.
[01:26:33.151 --> 01:26:34.032]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.533 --> 01:26:36.054]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:37.032 --> 01:26:39.814]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.697 --> 01:26:48.942]  It's here, and Ted Anderson from Midas Resources wants to be sure you call right now and get yours today.
[01:26:49.362 --> 01:26:51.824]  It's the 22nd edition Blue Book of Gun Values.
[01:26:52.084 --> 01:26:53.405]  I love going to all the big gun shows.
[01:26:53.425 --> 01:26:53.986]  All the big guns.
[01:26:54.026 --> 01:26:55.227]  Debt without bankruptcy.
[01:26:55.247 --> 01:26:59.710]  1-2-3-NoDebt.com Live debt free now.
[01:27:00.071 --> 01:27:01.652]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:25.512]  Alright folks, we're back live.
[01:27:25.592 --> 01:27:26.473]  Alex Jones here.
[01:27:29.376 --> 01:27:37.083]  And we see this phony patriotism of loving torture, lauding evil.
[01:27:39.425 --> 01:27:40.546]  And it's a process.
[01:27:40.626 --> 01:27:45.271]  It's a process of manipulating us.
[01:27:46.986 --> 01:27:47.606]  We're good to go.
[01:28:09.628 --> 01:28:17.531]  We're going to have a gambling system that bets on dead US troops and dead foreign leaders and what US city is going to be hit by smallpox or nuked by North Korea.
[01:28:18.883 --> 01:28:19.303]  We're good to go.
[01:28:19.323 --> 01:28:19.683]  I think?
[01:28:47.375 --> 01:28:49.276]  Then people say, well, it's a tough war.
[01:28:49.356 --> 01:28:49.997]  We've got to win it.
[01:28:50.017 --> 01:28:51.738]  You know, that's what the Soviets said.
[01:28:51.778 --> 01:28:53.319]  That's why they would torture our people.
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.421]  We're becoming evil, folks.
[01:28:56.461 --> 01:28:59.964]  We're having our minds warped right in front of everyone.
[01:29:01.285 --> 01:29:07.709]  And the patriotism of the people that promote this is as phony as those plastic, made-in-China American flags.
[01:29:08.130 --> 01:29:10.851]  Let's talk to John in Michigan.
[01:29:10.871 --> 01:29:11.572]  John, you're on the air.
[01:29:11.612 --> 01:29:12.012]  Go ahead.
[01:29:12.433 --> 01:29:12.813]  Hello, Alex.
[01:29:12.873 --> 01:29:13.173]  How are you?
[01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:14.194]  Fantastic, sir.
[01:29:14.785 --> 01:29:15.365]  You're a patriot.
[01:29:15.805 --> 01:29:16.466]  You're one of the few.
[01:29:16.646 --> 01:29:19.087]  We've got one here locally named Mark Scott.
[01:29:19.567 --> 01:29:21.528]  He, for years, was on a local radio station here.
[01:29:21.548 --> 01:29:24.489]  He was taking off-night broadcasts on the Internet.
[01:29:25.069 --> 01:29:28.070]  He used to talk about the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations all the time.
[01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:37.634]  Our local news channel here this morning, Channel 7, our ABC affiliate, had a story regarding the Homeland, Department for Homeland Control, I mean Security.
[01:29:37.654 --> 01:29:41.055]  The Department of Homeland Enslavement?
[01:29:41.435 --> 01:29:42.036]  Oh, yeah, that too.
[01:29:43.393 --> 01:29:48.857]  Saying now that when you fly in an airplane that you need proof of residence, your actual physical address.
[01:29:49.137 --> 01:29:55.501]  So your driver's license, birth certificate, passport or whatever is no longer valid.
[01:29:55.521 --> 01:29:56.662]  They're trying to push that through.
[01:29:57.462 --> 01:29:58.843]  Well, it's a lot more than that.
[01:29:58.943 --> 01:30:04.567]  The CAPS-2 system is the Total Information Awareness Network, Echoline.
[01:30:05.894 --> 01:30:10.897]  Looking at your bank records, your credit report, and you'll have four levels of security.
[01:30:10.957 --> 01:30:14.800]  You may not be allowed to fly if you have bad credit.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:26.508]  So this is the whole debtor prison system, and then the feds can carry out a few terror attacks on the streets and then get those checkpoints moved down to the streets and the ferries and everywhere else.
[01:30:26.728 --> 01:30:30.511]  Because we have a Canadian for our governor.
[01:30:30.551 --> 01:30:31.992]  We don't even have an American citizen.
[01:30:32.232 --> 01:30:33.933]  We have a Canadian here, Governor Granholm.
[01:30:34.759 --> 01:30:41.824]  And, you know, she's all for the Click It or Take It program, saying, you know... Which is training your local police to be federalized.
[01:30:41.844 --> 01:30:42.565]  Sure.
[01:30:42.685 --> 01:30:45.387]  Has nothing to do with the seatbelt.
[01:30:45.427 --> 01:30:55.795]  Their own federal plan, National Seatbelt Use Initiative, Part 3, 1998, says it's about training you for internal checkpoints and toll roads.
[01:30:56.215 --> 01:30:58.797]  A couple more things, and I know you've got a bunch of... No, no, go ahead.
[01:30:59.817 --> 01:30:59.998]  The...
[01:31:01.563 --> 01:31:06.765]  The typical neocon prototype, Sean Hannity, has his own little website where he has a chat room on there.
[01:31:08.266 --> 01:31:18.110]  You would not believe the people that just think that Lord Bush and Lord Dadcroft are for the good.
[01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:25.633]  There's a couple of us on there that believe in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, and I just cannot believe...
[01:31:26.348 --> 01:31:27.709]  And I feel sometimes that I'm in the minority.
[01:31:27.729 --> 01:31:30.692]  You mentioned that Bush is going to sign the assault weapon ban.
[01:31:30.912 --> 01:31:32.153]  And then they call me a leftist.
[01:31:32.414 --> 01:31:33.875]  They call me a liberal.
[01:31:34.035 --> 01:31:35.977]  Oh, hey, hey, hey, I've been on talk shows.
[01:31:36.897 --> 01:31:43.118]  And we'll take 20 calls, intelligent, informed people, left, right, black, white, you know, all agreeing.
[01:31:43.739 --> 01:31:47.639]  And then there'll be one guy going, how you doing, you little liberal squirrel?
[01:31:47.659 --> 01:31:49.060]  How dare you?
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:52.160]  You know, Bush needs to sign the assault weapons ban.
[01:31:52.921 --> 01:31:54.821]  And I'll go, well, you know, that's not conservative.
[01:31:54.941 --> 01:31:55.981]  Oh, you're the liberal.
[01:31:56.101 --> 01:31:56.841]  Shut up!
[01:31:56.901 --> 01:32:03.303]  Well, you know, and then you put on there, well, you know, why do my local state representatives need...
[01:32:04.449 --> 01:32:05.930]  Have assault weapons on their bodyguards.
[01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:08.031]  I mean, if they can have them, why can't I?
[01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:08.831]  Here's the point.
[01:32:08.851 --> 01:32:12.573]  You're on a supposed Republican website, and they're calling you a liberal because you're pro-gun.
[01:32:12.833 --> 01:32:17.255]  Right, and I put on there, my call sign is non-Neocon John.
[01:32:17.955 --> 01:32:23.378]  So they're out there saying that I'm a liberal, that I don't support.
[01:32:23.598 --> 01:32:24.318]  No, no, I know.
[01:32:24.598 --> 01:32:32.462]  Listen, I've had conservative friends of mine who just thought I was the cat's meow walk up to me,
[01:32:33.673 --> 01:32:36.256]  Actually, my friend George did this.
[01:32:36.316 --> 01:32:39.019]  He's been arrested for protesting abortion clinics.
[01:32:39.379 --> 01:32:40.140]  Him and his wife.
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:41.822]  He was in jail like six months one time.
[01:32:42.222 --> 01:32:43.223]  Really nice guy.
[01:32:43.644 --> 01:32:45.426]  Works in radio and TV here locally.
[01:32:46.354 --> 01:32:49.236]  But I had him write a 911, walk up and go, we've got to give up our liberties.
[01:32:49.256 --> 01:32:50.276]  We've got to do it now.
[01:32:50.296 --> 01:32:51.417]  We've got to submit to this.
[01:32:51.477 --> 01:32:52.317]  I'll take a chip.
[01:32:52.797 --> 01:32:53.798]  Bush has taken over.
[01:32:53.918 --> 01:32:54.859]  Finally, the Republicans.
[01:32:54.879 --> 01:32:56.339]  And I said, what about faith-based initiative?
[01:32:56.359 --> 01:32:57.840]  He goes, we need to be the government.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:01.102]  I mean, he was, like, really possessed by the spirit of evil.
[01:33:01.122 --> 01:33:05.524]  And I said, George, I go, let me show you some documents.
[01:33:05.564 --> 01:33:06.445]  He goes, I don't care.
[01:33:06.545 --> 01:33:07.085]  I don't care.
[01:33:07.405 --> 01:33:08.125]  It's our time.
[01:33:08.145 --> 01:33:10.847]  And I said, you have really been given a strong delusion.
[01:33:11.932 --> 01:33:13.613]  And I said, you're going to wake up to that.
[01:33:13.853 --> 01:33:16.334]  And he came back to me later and apologized.
[01:33:16.394 --> 01:33:26.439]  But they just get sucked into this mindless sports fan mentality of they're Cowboys fans and the Republicans are the Cowboys and don't talk about my Cowboys.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:35.024]  You know, another thing that really bothers me is that I feel that you and people that think along the lines of you and myself, that we're in the minority.
[01:33:35.064 --> 01:33:36.485]  But actually, we're in the majority.
[01:33:36.645 --> 01:33:39.026]  And the majority won't speak up because they take...
[01:33:39.767 --> 01:33:48.128]  It's like they bend over and, okay, well, you know, the government's... Hey, did you mention to the neocons on here that Bush is calling for amnesty, open borders?
[01:33:48.609 --> 01:33:48.889]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:49.049 --> 01:33:52.249]  And, you know, all I get is, oh, yeah, the black helicopters are flying.
[01:33:52.289 --> 01:33:54.210]  Here comes neocon John Rudy.
[01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:54.790]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:55.670]  I mean, that's what they say.
[01:33:55.710 --> 01:33:58.830]  You say the size of government's growing at record rates under Bush.
[01:33:59.150 --> 01:33:59.971]  Black helicopter.
[01:33:59.991 --> 01:34:01.151]  I mean, that's what Ann Coulter is.
[01:34:01.331 --> 01:34:02.091]  Black helicopter.
[01:34:02.111 --> 01:34:02.891]  Black helicopter.
[01:34:02.911 --> 01:34:03.431]  She's an idiot.
[01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:06.192]  I mean, she... Okay, she went to the University of Michigan.
[01:34:06.312 --> 01:34:07.332]  I happen to live in Ann Arbor.
[01:34:07.592 --> 01:34:07.772]  Okay?
[01:34:08.396 --> 01:34:11.877]  The Communist-held Union Socialist Republic of Ann Arbor.
[01:34:11.897 --> 01:34:17.438]  Well, hey, did you mention that Ron Paul, the most... You ought to take quotes of Paul's.
[01:34:17.498 --> 01:34:18.678]  I do, and then I get bashed for it.
[01:34:18.938 --> 01:34:20.078]  Oh, Ron Paul's an idiot.
[01:34:20.118 --> 01:34:20.999]  He doesn't know anything.
[01:34:21.139 --> 01:34:26.660]  Most conservative voting record, and he says that the Communist Party runs the White House.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:33.641]  And then Ron Paul gives their own quotes out of their own books that they're Trotskyites.
[01:34:34.081 --> 01:34:38.102]  Oh, and then if you mention Trotskyites, half of the neocons don't even know who he is.
[01:34:39.108 --> 01:34:43.136]  Look, look, look.
[01:34:43.156 --> 01:34:44.579]  It's just like the Terminator movies.
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:48.407]  Each generation gets more deadly, more sneaky, more powerful.
[01:34:48.908 --> 01:34:49.610]  The liberals...
[01:34:50.370 --> 01:34:50.810]  Exactly.
[01:34:50.991 --> 01:34:53.272]  And then, you know, my wife...
[01:35:17.884 --> 01:35:19.766]  She voted for Clinton two times.
[01:35:19.826 --> 01:35:21.568]  She felt she was voting for the lesser of two evils.
[01:35:22.589 --> 01:35:25.532]  I've somewhat swayed her over to the good side instead of the dark side.
[01:35:25.572 --> 01:35:29.076]  And you were able to do that by exposing the Republicans are corrupt, too.
[01:35:29.436 --> 01:35:34.141]  Liberals are never going to listen to us when we point at corrupt Republicans and say, that's good.
[01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:35.943]  Because they know that they're working together.
[01:35:36.163 --> 01:35:38.466]  You know, Carol Quigley wrote in his book that, you know, I mean...
[01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:44.468]  Oh, but that's just the dean of the Georgetown Political Science and Bill Clinton's mentor.
[01:35:44.628 --> 01:35:51.850]  You know, he said the CFR and things run things and they control the left and right, but let's ignore what he said to black helicopters.
[01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:53.270]  One more thing and I'll let you go.
[01:35:53.610 --> 01:35:55.211]  You know, people don't understand.
[01:35:55.491 --> 01:35:58.912]  They watch these movies called Minority Report or anything along those lines.
[01:35:59.032 --> 01:36:03.473]  Where do you think they come up with this technology or these ideas for the movie?
[01:36:03.793 --> 01:36:06.054]  Everything except for the psychics is already here.
[01:36:06.781 --> 01:36:07.302]  Oh, yeah.
[01:36:07.562 --> 01:36:14.729]  But, you know, they put that out there so that way when the time does come, people go, oh, really?
[01:36:14.749 --> 01:36:15.930]  That was a minority report.
[01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:23.318]  By the way, I was watching HBO about a month ago, and they had the making of Minority Report, and Spielberg actually said that.
[01:36:24.118 --> 01:36:24.298]  Yeah.
[01:36:24.719 --> 01:36:26.140]  They said, oh, yeah, this is the future.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:29.764]  This kind of gets us ready for it and what type of future we're going to have.
[01:36:29.824 --> 01:36:30.665]  I mean, they said it.
[01:36:32.062 --> 01:36:33.043]  Well, sir, you've got a great show.
[01:36:33.063 --> 01:36:35.664]  I listen to you every day, and keep fighting the fight.
[01:36:35.864 --> 01:36:36.645]  All right, thank you.
[01:36:36.825 --> 01:36:39.386]  Yeah, I mean, look, Sean Hannity's attacked me many times.
[01:36:40.507 --> 01:36:46.050]  I've listened to his show probably 20 times on radio and probably 50 times, I don't know, 100 times on TV.
[01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:47.751]  And he's attacked me on radio.
[01:36:47.951 --> 01:36:49.292]  When I tune in, I've heard it.
[01:36:49.772 --> 01:36:51.133]  He doesn't do it now, I'm told.
[01:36:51.673 --> 01:36:52.774]  He got smarter than that.
[01:36:53.894 --> 01:36:57.417]  I mean, he's got that whole nice boy, next-door neighbor, friendly.
[01:36:57.537 --> 01:36:58.898]  Oh, thank you so much.
[01:36:59.638 --> 01:37:02.480]  Oh, gee, Mrs. Cleaver.
[01:37:04.622 --> 01:37:06.663]  It's Eddie Haskell.
[01:37:08.705 --> 01:37:12.467]  And that whole Eddie Haskell thing doesn't fool this Texan, folks.
[01:37:13.348 --> 01:37:13.929]  I'm sorry.
[01:37:13.989 --> 01:37:14.669]  I'm sick of it.
[01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:18.592]  And they can... It's incredible.
[01:37:19.192 --> 01:37:20.333]  I'm just totally blown away.
[01:37:20.373 --> 01:37:22.735]  But what that caller has said he experienced...
[01:37:24.193 --> 01:37:35.079]  I got a few emails about a month ago when I was on this Louisiana radio station, and three or four guys called in and said that I was liberal because I was for the Second Amendment.
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.941]  And a few listeners couldn't believe that.
[01:37:38.641 --> 01:37:39.982]  Well, you just heard the caller.
[01:37:40.162 --> 01:37:40.883]  It's happened to him.
[01:37:41.223 --> 01:37:43.104]  Go experience it with a neocon.
[01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:46.746]  Say you're for lower taxes, and they will call you a liberal.
[01:37:47.530 --> 01:37:52.672]  I mean, these people, they are the ultimate of what they decry.
[01:37:52.952 --> 01:38:02.156]  They are the most mindless, the most spineless, the most ignorant and shallow, stupid people you can imagine.
[01:38:02.917 --> 01:38:05.878]  I mean, and they will savage Ron Paul.
[01:38:06.938 --> 01:38:10.480]  They will savage him with the most conservative voting record.
[01:38:12.023 --> 01:38:12.383]  Do it.
[01:38:12.944 --> 01:38:13.664]  Do it.
[01:38:14.204 --> 01:38:15.765]  Call into one of these radio shows.
[01:38:15.945 --> 01:38:20.347]  First, email the host, Ron Paul's speech, where he said the ultimate threat is George Bush.
[01:38:21.288 --> 01:38:21.628]  He is.
[01:38:21.668 --> 01:38:23.149]  He's a Trojan horse, folks.
[01:38:24.949 --> 01:38:27.271]  Let's talk to, I mean, you want big government.
[01:38:27.291 --> 01:38:27.751]  This is it.
[01:38:28.011 --> 01:38:28.791]  Ken in Ohio.
[01:38:28.831 --> 01:38:29.332]  Go ahead, Ken.
[01:38:29.352 --> 01:38:30.172]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:38:30.372 --> 01:38:31.493]  Pretty good, sir.
[01:38:32.453 --> 01:38:34.274]  Glad you started your show talking about chemtrails.
[01:38:35.214 --> 01:38:40.477]  Up here in Youngstown, Warren area, we have received an incredible amount of chemtrails.
[01:38:42.417 --> 01:38:52.123]  They say in Oklahoma the spring may go on for a year, and they've got the helicopters, the planes spraying bacteria, and it's just a new way of life.
[01:38:52.163 --> 01:38:54.425]  The government just sprays us with bacteria for our safety.
[01:38:54.945 --> 01:39:06.993]  Well, after they laid these trails down for a couple days, after the sky was a nice purple-orange in the evening, it proceeded to rain heavier than it has ever rained here in the history of Youngstown-Warren area.
[01:39:07.073 --> 01:39:08.014]  Half the area is flooded.
[01:39:09.187 --> 01:39:12.288]  And I was watching the Alex Jones Show from 10 to 1.
[01:39:12.328 --> 01:39:13.769]  That's when we received it up here on the Internet.
[01:39:13.929 --> 01:39:18.711]  I can't really get it on the radio because the closest station is 900 AM in Dayton.
[01:39:19.552 --> 01:39:20.872]  And I turned off my TV.
[01:39:20.912 --> 01:39:23.994]  I turned the volume all the way down on my TV.
[01:39:24.994 --> 01:39:30.416]  And suddenly my TV started beeping when the volume was off.
[01:39:30.817 --> 01:39:31.657]  I couldn't understand this.
[01:39:31.837 --> 01:39:38.580]  And it was the emergency broadcast system has already set up so your TV will beep even if the volume is off.
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:43.163]  I had the FCC former top lawyer on.
[01:39:43.223 --> 01:39:47.867]  He's retired and is a professor at Chicago University up in Illinois.
[01:39:49.469 --> 01:39:50.049]  Illinois.
[01:39:50.449 --> 01:39:55.093]  And they tried it in 1989 in Atlanta.
[01:39:56.334 --> 01:39:59.237]  The TVs already had remote control in them, everything.
[01:39:59.257 --> 01:40:05.502]  You take control of your radios, your TVs, and, of course, the transmission systems themselves, and the people backlash.
[01:40:05.542 --> 01:40:05.923]  But, yeah.
[01:40:05.943 --> 01:40:06.163]  Yeah.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:11.622]  I told you the new Scientific Atlantic cable box has a microphone in it.
[01:40:12.803 --> 01:40:29.311]  They admit, according to Television Week, that the feds are using it to listen to people, that they are using the systems to track us, and they admit that 40 million cars have the black box, but what they don't tell you is that black box doesn't just track where you go and how fast you drive.
[01:40:30.052 --> 01:40:37.815]  It's a plug-in for the satellite interface, and I have the federal plans now admitted in the Associated Press to start the taxation.
[01:40:38.095 --> 01:40:41.016]  So they put all this in decades before.
[01:40:41.076 --> 01:40:46.717]  Does that not show you the creeping universality of this system?
[01:40:47.097 --> 01:40:47.618]  Unbelievable.
[01:40:48.058 --> 01:40:48.938]  Well, here's my question.
[01:40:48.998 --> 01:40:54.940]  Since they have this already in place, since they already seem to have this in place, since they have already desensitized everybody through the chemtrails,
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:00.423]  And now your telescreen was beeping at you, even with it off.
[01:41:01.124 --> 01:41:01.304]  Yes.
[01:41:03.465 --> 01:41:11.630]  And for those who don't know, Winston, for his own good, in 1984, the telescreen shouts orders at him.
[01:41:12.751 --> 01:41:16.513]  I think I'm going to have to go around the corner in my room to write my diary like he did.
[01:41:17.794 --> 01:41:19.135]  Well, that's what Al-Qaeda does, yes.
[01:41:19.535 --> 01:41:20.336]  Well, here's my question.
[01:41:20.356 --> 01:41:24.779]  Since they already have this in place, and since people are already desensitized, and since...
[01:41:26.345 --> 01:41:29.466]  This evil crew, they always like to tell people what they're going to do next.
[01:41:29.486 --> 01:41:30.246]  I don't know why.
[01:41:30.266 --> 01:41:36.048]  They have promised us that they're going to nerve gas us, release smallpox, and nuke us.
[01:41:36.248 --> 01:41:40.709]  And lately they've been saying they're going to use, Al-Qaeda's going to use planes again.
[01:41:41.569 --> 01:41:43.189]  In other words, they're going to use planes again.
[01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:48.831]  And would you think, since they already have this system in place, do you think this is how they're going to go about the next wave of attacks?
[01:41:50.103 --> 01:41:51.764]  I don't know when they're going to launch it.
[01:41:51.844 --> 01:41:53.686]  I know that they're in deep trouble right now.
[01:41:53.886 --> 01:41:56.528]  More than ever, people are awake to what they're doing.
[01:41:56.548 --> 01:42:02.072]  And I think they're in a moment of faltering right now, which makes them even more dangerous.
[01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:04.421]  We're good to go.
[01:42:04.481 --> 01:42:04.641]  I think?
[01:42:28.314 --> 01:42:29.655]  Keep pointing out what they're doing.
[01:42:29.695 --> 01:42:30.835]  That torture's wrong.
[01:42:30.855 --> 01:42:32.676]  That betting on our dead troops is wrong.
[01:42:33.136 --> 01:42:37.498]  We just keep pointing out that giant prisons being our number one part of our economy is wrong.
[01:42:37.538 --> 01:42:43.240]  We keep pointing out that killing our troops in admitted biotest in the 80s was wrong.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.581]  We keep saying, no, I don't care if you say it's good.
[01:42:45.961 --> 01:42:46.642]  It's wrong.
[01:42:47.242 --> 01:42:48.923]  We have the moral high ground.
[01:42:49.083 --> 01:42:49.723]  We're right.
[01:42:50.063 --> 01:42:52.044]  And if we have the courage, they're going to have to back off.
[01:42:52.084 --> 01:42:52.644]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:52.664 --> 01:42:52.984]  Thank you.
[01:42:53.004 --> 01:42:54.045]  Appreciate it.
[01:42:54.185 --> 01:42:56.566]  And before I end this segment and come back and take more calls...
[01:42:58.946 --> 01:43:04.652]  I didn't really plug it last hour, and it's how we support this broadcast, and they're wonderful videos.
[01:43:04.672 --> 01:43:05.853]  They're so informative.
[01:43:06.514 --> 01:43:08.877]  They're waking up most people that see them.
[01:43:09.858 --> 01:43:11.640]  They're all over two hours long.
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:17.346]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, is about September 11th and proves the global has carried it out.
[01:43:18.223 --> 01:43:26.705]  And the most important thing we can do right now is prove to people that the military-industrial complex carried September 11th out just like Hitler blew up his Reichstag.
[01:43:27.225 --> 01:43:31.166]  And the film proves it from their own declassified documents.
[01:43:31.386 --> 01:43:32.306]  It's admitted, okay?
[01:43:33.246 --> 01:43:34.386]  This is a fact, people.
[01:43:35.166 --> 01:43:36.627]  You need to get Road to Tyranny.
[01:43:36.867 --> 01:43:38.327]  You need to make 100 copies of it.
[01:43:38.707 --> 01:43:40.487]  Get it out to opinion makers in your area.
[01:43:40.507 --> 01:43:44.748]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, part two of that film is Masters of Terror.
[01:43:44.768 --> 01:43:47.889]  9-1-1 is a big story and takes a lot of time to tell it
[01:43:48.624 --> 01:43:50.025]  My book is Ascent into Tyranny.
[01:43:50.045 --> 01:43:50.906]  It's about September 11th.
[01:43:50.926 --> 01:43:51.146]  230 pages, only $12.
[01:43:51.186 --> 01:43:51.887]  The films are $25.95 apiece.
[01:43:51.927 --> 01:43:53.108]  Order three or more.
[01:43:53.128 --> 01:43:56.391]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[01:43:56.411 --> 01:43:59.794]  Big discount.
[01:44:06.117 --> 01:44:08.619]  The new film is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:09.340]  It's excellent.

[01:44:34.247 --> 01:44:35.288]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:44:35.448 --> 01:44:39.651]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:44:40.472 --> 01:44:42.733]  The toll-free number to order my videos is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:44:42.753 --> 01:44:43.794]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:44:43.874 --> 01:44:49.218]  We also have the new George Humphrey 9-1-1 The Great Illusion audiobooks.
[01:44:50.019 --> 01:44:50.559]  They're amazing.
[01:44:50.579 --> 01:44:51.940]  Be sure and get those, too.
[01:45:04.412 --> 01:45:08.759]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:45:08.939 --> 01:45:13.366]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:45:13.526 --> 01:45:17.872]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:45:17.932 --> 01:45:19.274]  The New World Order.
[01:45:20.896 --> 01:45:25.280]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:32.265]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:45:32.405 --> 01:45:34.507]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:45:34.647 --> 01:45:45.236]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:45:45.416 --> 01:45:47.958]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my
[01:45:48.238 --> 01:45:48.619]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:45:48.679 --> 01:45:50.080]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:46:06.511 --> 01:46:11.013]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:46:11.353 --> 01:46:15.455]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:46:15.735 --> 01:46:16.296]  We listened.
[01:46:16.596 --> 01:46:21.578]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:46:21.858 --> 01:46:22.338]  We listened.
[01:46:22.719 --> 01:46:25.760]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:26.720]  We listened.
[01:46:27.181 --> 01:46:30.062]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[01:46:30.162 --> 01:46:30.662]  We're good to go.
[01:46:57.084 --> 01:47:01.286]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:47:01.546 --> 01:47:02.967]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:47:03.948 --> 01:47:12.392]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:47:12.632 --> 01:47:14.873]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:47:15.073 --> 01:47:21.416]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:47:21.756 --> 01:47:22.417]  We're good to go.
[01:47:41.954 --> 01:47:42.614]  We're good to go.
[01:48:13.267 --> 01:48:14.568]  All right.
[01:48:16.028 --> 01:48:21.249]  John, Peter, JQ, John, Mark, others, your calls are coming up.
[01:48:21.369 --> 01:48:24.210]  And usually I cover some of the news.
[01:48:24.250 --> 01:48:26.310]  Today I've been out of control.
[01:48:26.331 --> 01:48:28.051]  I haven't really covered much of the news.
[01:48:28.111 --> 01:48:32.312]  But the callers have brought up much of the information I was already going to mention.
[01:48:33.442 --> 01:48:35.923]  And taking us in directions that we wouldn't have gone in.
[01:48:36.264 --> 01:48:37.384]  Very important stuff.
[01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:40.126]  But I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[01:48:40.146 --> 01:48:45.709]  I'm going to talk to these callers that are on hold, and then I'm not going to take any more calls.
[01:48:45.769 --> 01:48:52.333]  So we'll probably take another 20, 30 minutes of calls into the next hour, and then the last 30 minutes I'll cover news.
[01:48:53.373 --> 01:48:54.894]  I need to get to some of this, though.
[01:48:55.535 --> 01:48:56.375]  But it's ridiculous.
[01:48:56.415 --> 01:48:58.396]  I mean, I really can't do justice to this stuff.
[01:48:59.097 --> 01:48:59.817]  Every story...
[01:49:00.563 --> 01:49:01.804]  This illustrates so much.
[01:49:01.844 --> 01:49:06.626]  Let me just cover one now, and then we'll break and come back and go to all these callers that are holding in the next hour.
[01:49:07.427 --> 01:49:08.487]  Let me just cover this now.
[01:49:08.507 --> 01:49:10.429]  Okay, this is out of the Christian Science Monitor.
[01:49:12.230 --> 01:49:13.610]  Up on InfoWars.com.
[01:49:13.710 --> 01:49:19.434]  To counter rising crime and terrorism, Moscow is set to recruit citizens as police eyes and ears.
[01:49:20.914 --> 01:49:28.919]  It was one of those dreaded possibilities that hung over everyday life in the Soviet Union, a summons to appear before the local bloc councils.
[01:49:30.091 --> 01:49:46.423]  These watchdogs of public morals and order could impose penalties from public humiliation to calling in the police for such offenses as shirking participation in voluntary, and that's in quotes, street-cleaning brigades or listening to foreign radio broadcasts.
[01:49:46.463 --> 01:49:57.431]  Under Stalin, people who encouraged and encountered were encouraged to submit anonymous denunciations of neighbors suspected of harboring anti-state opinions.
[01:49:58.115 --> 01:50:02.036]  Which often led to the victim's arrest and the gulag or execution.
[01:50:03.277 --> 01:50:05.758]  The councils were disbanded when the USSR collapsed.
[01:50:05.778 --> 01:50:06.398]  That's not true.
[01:50:06.818 --> 01:50:15.461]  But now Moscow city authorities have decided to revive them in what they say is a kinder, gentler version, similar to America's Neighborhood Watch programs.
[01:50:16.881 --> 01:50:18.642]  So see how it goes in circles.
[01:50:19.222 --> 01:50:21.563]  The Neighborhood Watch was just federalized for 9-1-1.
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:27.343]  I have AP articles where it said they're being trained to look for gun owners, drug dealers.
[01:50:27.823 --> 01:50:29.004]  I thought it was Homeland Security.
[01:50:29.204 --> 01:50:32.426]  But see, now they mix guns with drugs like guns are illegal.
[01:50:32.886 --> 01:50:35.949]  And, oh, there's lots of forms of terrorism.
[01:50:37.009 --> 01:50:40.091]  If someone says something mean to a neighbor, that could be terroristic.
[01:50:41.072 --> 01:50:44.254]  We have the new 311 tattletale line for you.
[01:50:45.815 --> 01:50:48.497]  And it goes on, echoing the views of many older...
[01:50:50.515 --> 01:50:51.316]  Moscovites.
[01:50:52.016 --> 01:50:56.898]  Pensioner Vladimir Mosovev says he supports the idea that something should be done.
[01:50:57.418 --> 01:50:58.799]  There is disorder everywhere.
[01:50:58.819 --> 01:51:00.579]  Well, you're still the same system.
[01:51:00.599 --> 01:51:01.420]  Just command and control.
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:02.300]  We don't call it communist.
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:09.943]  But another gentleman in the town who hails from the former Soviet Caucasus Republic is more skeptical.
[01:51:10.023 --> 01:51:14.965]  This looks good on paper, he says, but it might turn out quite another way in real life.
[01:51:15.973 --> 01:51:19.675]  And it goes on to say he already endures frequent document checks by police.
[01:51:20.296 --> 01:51:22.477]  People who help the police can be corrupt.
[01:51:22.957 --> 01:51:24.678]  They can tell lies about someone.
[01:51:24.799 --> 01:51:27.900]  It all depends on the people who get involved, he says.
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:28.161]  See?
[01:51:28.781 --> 01:51:30.842]  Yeah, criminals become the police, folks.
[01:51:31.703 --> 01:51:35.085]  A bill rushed through the first reading last week in Moscow Duma.
[01:51:35.525 --> 01:51:42.529]  Municipal legislature will install a Soviet-style system of grassroots supervision and control Moscow's 600 districts.
[01:51:44.409 --> 01:51:46.609]  And it talks about how they'll control people.
[01:51:47.790 --> 01:51:51.730]  Now, they've already set up Secure Corps, part of AmeriCorps.
[01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:55.231]  They want to make it National Compulsory Volunteerism.
[01:51:55.251 --> 01:51:55.851]  That's their word.
[01:51:56.271 --> 01:51:57.852]  Compulsory Volunteerism.
[01:51:58.472 --> 01:51:59.892]  Now, here's the double-think twist.
[01:52:00.092 --> 01:52:04.533]  And if you don't understand, folks, volunteering isn't compulsory or isn't volunteering.
[01:52:04.993 --> 01:52:09.494]  I know they didn't teach you that in public school, and I'm not trying to be patronizing here, but I get emails.
[01:52:09.514 --> 01:52:10.554]  People don't understand this.
[01:52:11.952 --> 01:52:12.452]  They're good to go.
[01:52:37.503 --> 01:52:38.063]  It's horrible.
[01:52:38.523 --> 01:52:40.364]  Folks, I've had carpet cleaners in my house.
[01:52:40.784 --> 01:52:43.665]  They see a shotgun and they run off to call the police.
[01:52:43.685 --> 01:52:47.327]  You know, in Texas, a shotgun.
[01:52:47.807 --> 01:52:49.027]  They think it's illegal.
[01:52:49.928 --> 01:52:52.769]  It's the tips program, which, by the way, got massive funding.
[01:52:54.189 --> 01:53:02.812]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:53:03.032 --> 01:53:04.713]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing...
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:10.141]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.797 --> 01:53:39.077]  You want to be a slave?
[01:53:39.118 --> 01:53:46.800]  You want to be a pathetic, bug-eyed serf, begging, licking the boots of stormtroopers in black ski masks?
[01:53:48.101 --> 01:53:49.481]  Well, you're going to get it then, folks.
[01:53:49.521 --> 01:53:53.242]  But if you want freedom, you better get your ears on, as they say.
[01:53:53.262 --> 01:53:55.863]  You better get involved in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:53:57.264 --> 01:54:03.086]  All right, I'm going to take five more calls, and then that's it for calls on this Open Life Friday, because I haven't gotten to much news yet.
[01:54:03.126 --> 01:54:05.026]  And I want to talk about what just came out.
[01:54:05.046 --> 01:54:06.827]  It turned out that Stalin tried to have...
[01:54:07.782 --> 01:54:08.842]  John Wayne killed.
[01:54:08.882 --> 01:54:09.543]  That's pretty interesting.
[01:54:09.583 --> 01:54:10.183]  I'm going to get to that.
[01:54:10.783 --> 01:54:16.905]  Bunch of news about Poindexter getting fired from his Total Information Awareness Network job, but that won't change things.
[01:54:16.945 --> 01:54:19.286]  It was there before Poindexter was in government in the 80s.
[01:54:21.327 --> 01:54:22.347]  So that's all coming up.
[01:54:22.967 --> 01:54:24.327]  Betting on dead U.S.
[01:54:24.368 --> 01:54:26.128]  soldiers was a little too much for people.
[01:54:27.068 --> 01:54:28.029]  We're not there yet.
[01:54:28.409 --> 01:54:29.629]  Torture of people's kids?
[01:54:30.009 --> 01:54:33.631]  Yeah, the public thinks that's great, but not our own troops yet.
[01:54:33.851 --> 01:54:34.431]  Don't worry.
[01:54:34.511 --> 01:54:34.751]  Soon.
[01:54:35.831 --> 01:54:37.092]  You can bet on our dead troops.
[01:54:37.172 --> 01:54:39.433]  But you haven't warped us quite yet.
[01:54:39.774 --> 01:54:42.335]  You moved a little too quick there.
[01:54:42.435 --> 01:54:43.176]  So that's coming up.
[01:54:43.216 --> 01:54:45.137]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:54:47.218 --> 01:54:49.340]  And I guess, Chris, I'm confused here.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.561]  Who should I go to first?
[01:54:52.162 --> 01:54:53.683]  John in North Carolina.
[01:54:53.723 --> 01:54:54.323]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:54:54.383 --> 01:54:55.724]  How are you doing today, sir?
[01:54:55.844 --> 01:54:56.324]  Pretty good.
[01:54:56.725 --> 01:54:59.126]  I'm calling from the People's Socialist Republic.
[01:54:59.867 --> 01:55:01.327]  That's the way we're acting here.
[01:55:02.088 --> 01:55:05.070]  I've got a couple comments and a couple questions for you, if I could, please.
[01:55:06.501 --> 01:55:18.569]  My first comment is I was a former Marine, and the men I served with, we were not pathological criminals like this individual that was crying for having shot a kid.
[01:55:18.609 --> 01:55:22.312]  This is dangerous and insane corruption here.
[01:55:23.613 --> 01:55:31.058]  And for the good veterans, I've heard call on your shoe and Mr. Stopmiller's shoe and on the GCN network in general.
[01:55:32.499 --> 01:55:34.340]  I don't think we're not at all like that.
[01:55:35.612 --> 01:55:37.093]  And I think this is insane.
[01:55:37.213 --> 01:55:37.893]  What do you think, sir?
[01:55:39.394 --> 01:55:59.382]  Well, it's been in the news that they're proud they killed children, and they do hoorah after killing them, and General Baucus resigned refusing to torture people at Camp X-Ray, but again, according to many, refusing to torture people's children now to get answers to save America when it's the government carrying out the terror to begin with.
[01:56:00.026 --> 01:56:06.568]  I mean, it just shows how far we've gone to where they thought they could come out and say, okay, we're going to bet on where our troops are going to die next.
[01:56:07.608 --> 01:56:11.489]  Sir, this is really, cannot be overemphasized, this is insane corruption.
[01:56:12.129 --> 01:56:13.629]  And it's very grievous.
[01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:15.250]  You know, I want to cry.
[01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:18.630]  I mean, the Iraqis are good, you know, in general, they're good people.
[01:56:19.331 --> 01:56:21.231]  And, I mean, how could you shoot a kid, you know?
[01:56:21.963 --> 01:56:23.504]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:56:24.124 --> 01:56:29.606]  Well, children get killed in war, but you don't celebrate it and say, I love to kill kids.
[01:56:29.986 --> 01:56:30.406]  Right, I know.
[01:56:30.446 --> 01:56:32.367]  I understand that.
[01:56:32.907 --> 01:56:36.869]  But, I mean, this is just, I mean, because these individuals, they're going to be coming back here.
[01:56:37.789 --> 01:56:45.532]  Well, that's the point I meant to make last hour, is that four members of one Delta Force unit came back and slaughtered their wives?
[01:56:46.412 --> 01:56:48.593]  I mean, these guys are going to come back and be our police?
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:53.481]  My two questions are this.
[01:56:54.741 --> 01:57:07.287]  You've been talking about, and I think you've probably had in the past, and I can't remember in specific, but guests on that have talked about CIA infiltration of police departments in major cities.
[01:57:08.267 --> 01:57:18.132]  I'm in the Piedmont of North Carolina, and this new sheriff we have, he's ex-State Bureau of Investigation.
[01:57:19.052 --> 01:57:20.713]  I was just wondering if you had any
[01:57:21.385 --> 01:57:24.506]  Well, this is what they do in key border states and other areas.
[01:57:25.426 --> 01:57:32.448]  They will get a former CIA or FBI guy who was in the internal corrupt area elected, and then they'll run drugs through their county.
[01:57:33.028 --> 01:57:33.188]  Right.
[01:57:33.228 --> 01:57:50.733]  Well, what I was going to ask you, if you have any correlated data that I could get to you that could show that any of the state bureau investigation, just to be sure if we have, he's staging up these PR drug busts.
[01:57:51.337 --> 01:57:57.422]  And then they celebrate the booty, and then they say, well, you know, you're guilty before proven innocent.
[01:57:57.443 --> 01:58:00.005]  Well, yeah, I don't know about your particular state police.
[01:58:00.125 --> 01:58:01.486]  I know there are no state police.
[01:58:01.526 --> 01:58:07.912]  They were chartered and founded in the 1930s by the federal government and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and you can read their original charters.
[01:58:08.733 --> 01:58:13.577]  So, yeah, I don't know about your particular state with your federal cadres, but I know most of them are criminals.
[01:58:15.931 --> 01:58:18.553]  Hardly a day goes by in the garden without the Cobra Head.
[01:58:18.693 --> 01:58:21.595]  I want to tell you about a great little garden tool called the Cobra Head.
[01:58:21.755 --> 01:58:27.599]  First, take half of the tools you're currently using in the garden, throw them away, and call 1-866-YO-COBRA.
[01:58:27.779 --> 01:58:30.020]  The Cobra Head is like having a steel fingernail.
[01:58:30.181 --> 01:58:36.125]  This tool plants, scalps, cultivates, transplants, detaches, harvests, furrows, digs, you name it.
[01:58:36.225 --> 01:58:37.405]  The Cobra Head can do it.
[01:58:37.666 --> 01:58:43.089]  With the Cobra Head, I can make quick work out of weeding my garden beds, especially between the garden rows where space is tight.
[01:58:46.071 --> 01:58:46.592]  We're good to go.
[01:58:46.632 --> 01:58:47.072]  We're good to go.
[01:59:15.743 --> 01:59:20.087]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:20.268 --> 01:59:24.692]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:24.832 --> 01:59:29.256]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:59:29.276 --> 01:59:30.598]  The New World Order.
[01:59:32.401 --> 01:59:36.623]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:36.683 --> 01:59:43.607]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:43.727 --> 01:59:45.868]  You will lose your liberty.

[02:00:15.450 --> 02:00:17.051]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.431 --> 02:00:23.175]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:00:23.435 --> 02:00:28.558]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:00:28.898 --> 02:00:38.223]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:00:38.543 --> 02:00:39.404]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp
[02:00:39.844 --> 02:00:43.486]  Right white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:00:43.806 --> 02:00:47.827]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:00:48.007 --> 02:00:52.749]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:00:53.150 --> 02:00:59.032]  The Mercury Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[02:01:20.171 --> 02:01:20.811]  Big Brother.
[02:01:21.491 --> 02:01:22.512]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:23.252 --> 02:01:24.352]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:25.012 --> 02:01:25.832]  You want answers?
[02:01:26.593 --> 02:01:28.513]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:28.533 --> 02:01:31.874]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:32.334 --> 02:01:36.455]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:36.655 --> 02:01:38.356]  All right.
[02:01:38.376 --> 02:01:45.778]  I am going to launch into the news here shortly on this live Friday edition of the Worldwide Show.
[02:01:45.798 --> 02:01:47.138]  But right now, we're taking calls.
[02:01:48.599 --> 02:01:52.763]  Well, let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio.
[02:01:53.784 --> 02:01:54.725]  John, you're on the air.
[02:01:54.765 --> 02:01:55.206]  Go ahead.
[02:01:56.407 --> 02:01:57.108]  Yes, hello.
[02:01:57.508 --> 02:02:12.223]  You know, I think some of the sirens that are going off at this gang of neocon fascists around Bush are really getting out of control, has been brought out by some of the people, the defections in the Pentagon and the CIA, as you've mentioned there.
[02:02:12.834 --> 02:02:15.655]  And it's being virtually censored by the corporate media.
[02:02:16.215 --> 02:02:22.076]  I had to read it on... Hey, look, you call in once a week, you plug that website in.
[02:02:22.096 --> 02:02:23.377]  No, no, it's a different one, the one you have.
[02:02:23.397 --> 02:02:24.137]  That's enough.
[02:02:25.057 --> 02:02:27.598]  The one I have, what website do I have, John?
[02:02:28.038 --> 02:02:28.318]  Pardon?
[02:02:29.298 --> 02:02:30.199]  The Global Research?
[02:02:31.019 --> 02:02:32.179]  Oh, I like Global Research.
[02:02:32.319 --> 02:02:33.459]  Yeah, globalresearch.ca.
[02:02:33.499 --> 02:02:33.980]  They had the...
[02:02:36.025 --> 02:02:36.465]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:03:02.514 --> 02:03:10.542]  Their plans for this project for a new American century is really akin to the Third Reich plans for world domination.
[02:03:10.682 --> 02:03:14.485]  Well, that's exactly what Ron Paul, a conservative, said.
[02:03:14.505 --> 02:03:24.234]  And then you've got the, I don't know what you call them, the global research folks I wouldn't call leftists because they're exposing the Federal Reserve and the bankers.
[02:03:25.294 --> 02:03:27.937]  I would call them, I guess, truly progressive conservatives.
[02:03:28.476 --> 02:03:41.140]  And what you see is here a deprogramming of the left and the right to be populist, to be constitutionalist, to be anti-establishment, because we have a corrupt system, and that's a good thing.
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:43.881]  Well, you know, I got some of the censorship, too.
[02:03:43.921 --> 02:03:47.542]  These people are not being advertised except out of these sort of websites.
[02:03:48.342 --> 02:03:49.403]  I wasn't censoring you.
[02:03:49.603 --> 02:03:53.846]  You call and you always plug that other website.
[02:03:54.006 --> 02:04:01.370]  And I don't censor anybody, but occasionally I get irritated when somebody always starts their call with the same line.
[02:04:02.791 --> 02:04:04.131]  That bothers me.
[02:04:04.172 --> 02:04:08.854]  What I was talking about is I was being censored by NPR, another example of censorship.
[02:04:09.595 --> 02:04:15.178]  I tried to call in yesterday when they were talking about the media's handling of the war and the treatment of Bush.
[02:04:15.635 --> 02:04:25.505]  And the whole trend of the people they had on there is that the American people want a more servile media towards Bush, a more patriotic media.
[02:04:25.565 --> 02:04:27.186]  They're getting more numbers for Fox.
[02:04:27.687 --> 02:04:28.528]  I had called in.
[02:04:28.548 --> 02:04:29.469]  I was set up.
[02:04:29.509 --> 02:04:30.750]  They said, we'll put you on next.
[02:04:31.232 --> 02:04:37.598]  And at that time that you get that hiss and that ten-second delay, he apparently read what I wanted to talk about.
[02:04:37.638 --> 02:04:39.359]  I made the mistake of honestly saying that.
[02:04:39.399 --> 02:04:45.705]  I wanted to point out that the media has really been acting as a kind of a servile mouthpiece for the Bush administration.
[02:04:47.246 --> 02:04:50.730]  John, you've got to understand that Bush isn't running anything.
[02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:51.630]  Bush is a puppet.
[02:04:51.730 --> 02:04:52.571]  Well, I understand that.
[02:04:52.631 --> 02:04:54.393]  But what I was trying to point out to them...
[02:04:55.533 --> 02:04:58.234]  At the point that he read what I wanted to say, I was just cut off.
[02:04:58.274 --> 02:05:04.436]  He then put on a man who said exactly the opposite and said, well, the media is too critical of Bush.
[02:05:04.696 --> 02:05:08.057]  That's why Bush and Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity are getting all the numbers.
[02:05:08.978 --> 02:05:13.179]  These guys were actually massaging him and saying, yeah, there's some truth to that.
[02:05:13.719 --> 02:05:18.620]  And he cut me off when I wanted to point out exactly the opposite.
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:24.422]  Notice that it's the so-called liberal NPR worshipping the neocons.
[02:05:24.442 --> 02:05:29.183]  They're getting the big government and the police state they always wanted.
[02:05:29.223 --> 02:05:30.124]  Thanks for the call.
[02:05:30.784 --> 02:05:31.524]  Thanks for the call.
[02:05:31.684 --> 02:05:42.667]  And then you get this side issue over here with Bush diverting people with red herrings about how he's against homosexual marriage.
[02:05:43.522 --> 02:05:44.683]  Total red herring.
[02:05:46.024 --> 02:05:49.065]  I mean, of course the majority of the American people are against that.
[02:05:49.806 --> 02:05:54.469]  And of course that's a bad thing.
[02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:58.551]  But Bush isn't going to do anything about it.
[02:05:58.631 --> 02:06:00.232]  It's all just rhetoric.
[02:06:00.292 --> 02:06:05.735]  He'll say he's against abortion and then tell the Senate not to pass the bill banning partial birth abortion.
[02:06:07.216 --> 02:06:10.278]  He'll say he's for guns and then sign the bill and restrict them.
[02:06:11.289 --> 02:06:14.711]  So we look at their actions, not their rhetoric, as Ron Paul said.
[02:06:15.332 --> 02:06:18.274]  Let's talk to Peter in Florida.
[02:06:18.294 --> 02:06:19.034]  Peter, go ahead.
[02:06:19.515 --> 02:06:20.215]  Yeah, hi, Jay.
[02:06:20.555 --> 02:06:20.755]  Hi.
[02:06:22.116 --> 02:06:24.498]  Got a little thing here for you.
[02:06:24.658 --> 02:06:28.320]  In 1851 in Holland, the king of Spain, Spain was running Holland.
[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:29.741]  They had power in Holland.
[02:06:30.502 --> 02:06:35.185]  And the central authorities were trying to control and censure the printing of books.
[02:06:36.343 --> 02:06:46.030]  And a town magistrate refused to, the town magistrate of Leiden refused to comply and use the occasion to express their belief in the sovereignty of the free individual.
[02:06:46.830 --> 02:06:56.137]  They said reason, they wrote, which is the adversary of all tyrants, teaches us that truth can be as little restrained as light.
[02:06:57.099 --> 02:07:02.780]  And that was in 1851, and that same year they kicked out the New World Order and set up a republic.
[02:07:03.161 --> 02:07:16.924]  You know, I've read that quote, and if the globalists think they're going to get their New World Order here, I don't care how many mindless liberals and neocon followers they've got, as you just said...
[02:07:17.910 --> 02:07:19.571]  We're good to go.
[02:07:40.734 --> 02:07:48.449]  And they just have to kill off all the best and brightest, kill off their own people, just slaughter and murder, and they'll probably do that.
[02:07:49.119 --> 02:07:53.420]  And then again, pose as the Savior while the crisis is taking place.
[02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:59.522]  Yeah, you only need to revisit the history of the 20th century in the correct light and understand it for what it is.
[02:07:59.742 --> 02:08:03.362]  You know, I've seen that quote before, and I'd like to put that quote on my website.
[02:08:04.203 --> 02:08:13.645]  Email me that quote at tips at infowars.com, but read folks that quote by the town magistrate there in Holland again.
[02:08:14.235 --> 02:08:14.755]  Read it again.
[02:08:14.815 --> 02:08:15.516]  All right.
[02:08:15.676 --> 02:08:19.177]  The central authorities were trying to control and censure the printing of books.
[02:08:20.097 --> 02:08:26.720]  The town magistrate, like, you know, the towns have to stand up to get rid of this new world order.
[02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:32.982]  The town magistrate refused to comply and used occasion to express their beliefs in the sovereignty of the free individual.
[02:08:33.642 --> 02:08:43.166]  They said reason, which is the adversary of all tyrants, teaches us that truth can be as little restrained as light.
[02:08:46.348 --> 02:08:46.929]  That's it.
[02:08:47.630 --> 02:08:53.359]  And so they just try to condition us to hear the truth, to know the truth, but then do nothing about it.
[02:08:53.900 --> 02:09:01.692]  Well, they were probably in trouble because too much truth was getting out, and they obviously kicked out the king of Spain out of Holland and set up the republic.
[02:09:02.299 --> 02:09:10.325]  And then, out of the ideas that were in Holland, merged with the Magna Carta and the Old Testament, we got groups of people that came here.
[02:09:10.345 --> 02:09:12.907]  Yes, and set up the republic.
[02:09:13.888 --> 02:09:17.150]  It wouldn't have been the same republic if Holland hadn't done that before us.
[02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:26.717]  It would have been more... We used a lot of their... I've got a 30-second piece of Bush Sr.'
[02:09:26.677 --> 02:09:28.859]  's speech on the 27th of September, 2002.
[02:09:30.871 --> 02:09:31.752]  Want to hear it?
[02:09:32.052 --> 02:09:32.892]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:09:33.273 --> 02:09:33.553]  Okay.
[02:09:33.773 --> 02:09:35.734]  Put your phone right up to the speaker.
[02:09:36.195 --> 02:09:54.487]  I am an unabashed optimist, and despite the current war against terror, which will go on because of its shadowy nature and its Iraqi regime, and the other dangers we must confront in an unpredictable world, I still believe the collective commitment of the international community...
[02:09:55.031 --> 02:10:03.995]  To a new order of freedom with justice and democracy will continue to mold a kinder, gentler world for generations to come.
[02:10:05.176 --> 02:10:05.856]  Interesting, huh?
[02:10:06.577 --> 02:10:12.680]  Well, it's like Tony Blair saying, the new world must have order before Congress two weeks ago.
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:15.101]  And he mentioned democracy.
[02:10:15.441 --> 02:10:16.421]  Let me give you this here.
[02:10:17.202 --> 02:10:21.284]  You know that thing where people say, any law that's republic for the Constitution is null and void?
[02:10:22.404 --> 02:10:23.585]  Well, there's more to that in...
[02:10:24.474 --> 02:10:36.120]  In a republic, all law is subject to a higher standard, which Blackstone's law commentaries identifies as God's law, and any law that stands in conflict with this higher law is null and void.
[02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:47.306]  A republic preserves the biblical concept that the government is a minister of God, upholding his righteous command to punish the evildoer and encourage the good.
[02:10:50.549 --> 02:10:55.412]  A democracy makes the majority God, capable of determining good and evil by popular opinion.
[02:10:55.613 --> 02:10:56.173]  Well, that's it.
[02:10:56.213 --> 02:10:58.775]  It's two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:10:58.815 --> 02:11:05.019]  In a democracy, if 51% get together and say, take that man's ranch and give it to us, it happens.
[02:11:05.379 --> 02:11:06.860]  In a republic, you can't do that.
[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:07.521]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:08.361 --> 02:11:09.102]  Really good points.
[02:11:09.882 --> 02:11:13.805]  Let's talk to... I guess J.Q.
[02:11:13.825 --> 02:11:14.846]  in Oregon is up next.
[02:11:14.886 --> 02:11:15.506]  Go ahead, J.Q.
[02:11:15.546 --> 02:11:17.168]  Sure enough, Alex.
[02:11:17.208 --> 02:11:18.548]  Yeah, I want to bring up something...
[02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:23.308]  It happened, I guess, 50 or 60 years ago.
[02:11:23.409 --> 02:11:25.711]  Before your time, you may not know about it.
[02:11:25.771 --> 02:11:28.373]  I think a lot of older people have forgotten about it.
[02:11:29.294 --> 02:11:36.961]  But after World War II, the Japanese and Germans were tried for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
[02:11:37.822 --> 02:11:42.426]  And among the crimes were conspiring to launch a war of aggression.
[02:11:42.546 --> 02:11:44.828]  That is considered a crime against humanity.
[02:11:45.508 --> 02:11:47.090]  We tried the Japanese on that.
[02:11:47.702 --> 02:12:00.373]  And if I remember correctly... Well, J.Q., we already mentioned it earlier, and the government admits it, the general admitted it, they're grabbing people's children and holding them in horrible conditions, quote, till people answer their questions or turn themselves in.
[02:12:00.733 --> 02:12:06.398]  That is listed as torture, and Nazis went to prison and were hung for that.
[02:12:06.459 --> 02:12:06.859]  Go ahead.
[02:12:06.919 --> 02:12:07.439]  Exactly.
[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:10.622]  Torture was a crime against humanity.
[02:12:10.702 --> 02:12:14.886]  Murder of women and children, defenseless, is a crime against humanity.
[02:12:15.487 --> 02:12:22.657]  Our government is committing all of these classic crimes against humanity, and the American people are apparently supporting it.
[02:12:22.897 --> 02:12:25.621]  No, J.Q., I'll hold you over, but that's a key word you just said.
[02:12:26.061 --> 02:12:30.487]  I always say it's textbook tyranny, but really, a better word is it's classic.
[02:12:31.309 --> 02:12:33.011]  Everything they're doing is classic.
[02:12:33.567 --> 02:12:39.573]  They're following every classic formula with them all combined together in a big potluck nightmare.
[02:12:39.613 --> 02:12:40.034]  Comments?
[02:12:40.434 --> 02:12:48.563]  Yeah, well, I don't know what Bush is talking about when he talks about justice when his policies are crimes against humanity, torture.
[02:12:49.258 --> 02:12:53.839]  Launching wars of aggression, which is a crime against humanity.
[02:12:53.999 --> 02:12:54.880]  Stay there, JQ.
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:59.161]  PNAC said, his organization said, we must be hit by terrorists.
[02:12:59.481 --> 02:13:03.762]  We need the attacks to imperial mobilize the people.
[02:13:04.842 --> 02:13:06.123]  We need to lie to them.
[02:13:06.223 --> 02:13:07.383]  We need to get the oil.
[02:13:07.443 --> 02:13:08.824]  We need to get our New World Order.
[02:13:09.244 --> 02:13:13.045]  They are that cynical that they wrote it all down and published it before 9-1-1.
[02:13:15.968 --> 02:13:16.649]  We're good to go.
[02:13:34.949 --> 02:13:36.750]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:40.332]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:13:40.672 --> 02:13:51.117]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:13:51.437 --> 02:13:51.938]  That's right.

[02:16:11.078 --> 02:16:19.902]  I'm a nurse, and I injured my back, and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[02:16:20.182 --> 02:16:22.303]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[02:16:22.683 --> 02:16:27.324]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[02:16:27.645 --> 02:16:28.965]  It actually worked.
[02:16:29.424 --> 02:16:32.831]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[02:16:32.891 --> 02:16:34.413]  I've tried many, many products.
[02:16:34.554 --> 02:16:36.818]  I have never experienced anything like collagenate.
[02:16:37.178 --> 02:16:40.805]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[02:16:41.207 --> 02:16:41.827]  It truly works.
[02:16:42.188 --> 02:16:43.368]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[02:16:43.789 --> 02:16:49.492]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.

[02:17:00.719 --> 02:17:00.979]  1-800-622-THIN.
[02:17:00.999 --> 02:17:01.219]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:17:05.862 --> 02:17:06.522]  All right, folks.
[02:17:06.542 --> 02:17:07.022]  We're back live.
[02:17:35.675 --> 02:17:36.636]  It is Friday.
[02:17:36.656 --> 02:17:37.796]  We've got open phones.
[02:17:37.836 --> 02:17:39.557]  I'm really enjoying the discussion.
[02:17:40.778 --> 02:17:46.261]  I'm going to try to get through these two final callers, and I'm going to cover news for the last half of this hour in the next segment, so stay with us.
[02:17:47.261 --> 02:17:51.443]  JQ, any other comments you'd like to make about just the insanity?
[02:17:51.483 --> 02:18:01.589]  I mean, when they're on the news saying that they spray women and children and then they have little chants about killing kids, I mean, that really is the mind warp
[02:18:02.248 --> 02:18:03.149]  Of our military.
[02:18:03.430 --> 02:18:06.533]  Well, yeah, this is our military, but it's under command of Bush.
[02:18:07.114 --> 02:18:17.887]  Actually, if there's to be any justice in the world, Bush is going to have to be tried and hanged for the same reason the Japanese were tried and hanged, because he's guilty of the same crime.
[02:18:18.508 --> 02:18:21.552]  So until that happens, there will be no justice.
[02:18:23.169 --> 02:18:25.190]  JQ, JQ, listen.
[02:18:25.871 --> 02:18:29.512]  I wish no harm against President Bush, and I can't agree.
[02:18:29.532 --> 02:18:31.073]  All I want is justice, Alex.
[02:18:31.413 --> 02:18:33.254]  No, I've got to let you go.
[02:18:33.394 --> 02:18:36.676]  I can't sit here on the air and say things like that.
[02:18:37.296 --> 02:18:39.057]  Look, George Bush is a puppet.
[02:18:40.318 --> 02:18:41.418]  He's not running anything.
[02:18:41.438 --> 02:18:42.959]  Bill Clinton's not running anything.
[02:18:42.999 --> 02:18:51.063]  When people would call up and say stuff like that about Bill Clinton, I had to cut them off because this is a syndicated talk show, and I don't wish any harm against him.
[02:18:51.653 --> 02:18:57.895]  A state police officer violating the Fourth Amendment or against George W. Bush who just reads off teleprompters.
[02:18:58.015 --> 02:19:02.976]  But I understand that Joseph Mingala was bad when he tortured children.
[02:19:03.856 --> 02:19:06.777]  And I understand that Adolf Hitler was bad for giving those orders.
[02:19:08.217 --> 02:19:17.960]  But I cannot sit here, and even though our government is not our government and is carrying out terror attacks and killing people,
[02:19:18.932 --> 02:19:22.175]  And admittedly is torturing people and their children.
[02:19:22.235 --> 02:19:23.435]  This is all mainstream news.
[02:19:23.475 --> 02:19:43.350]  And even though they're butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution, I can honestly tell you that I don't wish any harm against the president, the figurehead we have in there, because that would only empower the New World Order and turn a teleprompter reader into a martyr.
[02:19:45.026 --> 02:19:48.370]  The globalists have to carry out their own terror attacks.
[02:19:51.273 --> 02:19:55.819]  The globalists have to carry out their own terror attacks just to pose as our saviors.
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:58.241]  See, they need violence.
[02:19:58.602 --> 02:20:00.204]  And, J.Q., I can...
[02:20:02.345 --> 02:20:12.433]  I mean, I understand what you're saying, that, well, if torture and murder and wars of aggression, you know, if Japanese were hung for that, then what's the justice in this government?
[02:20:12.933 --> 02:20:16.316]  This isn't even the American government that's doing this.
[02:20:16.456 --> 02:20:25.383]  And, again, I'm not sidestepping this or, oh, I don't know, what's the universal term they use?
[02:20:26.664 --> 02:20:28.365]  I'm not sidestepping this.
[02:20:28.705 --> 02:20:29.125]  I'm not...
[02:20:32.938 --> 02:20:34.159]  Pulling my punches.
[02:20:35.139 --> 02:20:35.999]  Still not the term.
[02:20:36.059 --> 02:20:39.901]  What I'm trying to say is, America isn't bad.
[02:20:39.981 --> 02:20:41.282]  The flag isn't bad.
[02:20:41.382 --> 02:20:43.483]  The Bill of Rights and Constitution isn't bad.
[02:20:43.983 --> 02:20:50.146]  A lot of leftists think, oh, America's bad because, you know, smallpox were given to the Indians on the blankets.
[02:20:50.206 --> 02:20:59.530]  Well, no, the railroads, the robber barons were corrupt, controlled the army, and gave them orders to do that to get people out of their way.
[02:21:02.196 --> 02:21:13.245]  I mean, is it saying that the Asian people that lived on the steppes were bad because Genghis Khan would murder everyone in his path?
[02:21:14.667 --> 02:21:19.090]  No, black people aren't bad because Idi Amin was a cannibal.
[02:21:20.171 --> 02:21:25.736]  Germans aren't bad because Adolf Hitler was bad, or Russians aren't bad because Stalin's bad.
[02:21:26.677 --> 02:21:28.998]  The people running our government are just puppets.
[02:21:29.258 --> 02:21:30.618]  America isn't doing this.
[02:21:31.198 --> 02:21:35.779]  Europe, that owns our central banks, gives the orders to invade all these countries.
[02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:43.822]  And then they sit back and act like they're the good cop, and, oh, they're against these wars of aggression and against all this criminality, you see.
[02:21:45.582 --> 02:21:53.164]  But I do think that those that are truly responsible, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the British Royal Family, the Dutch Royal Family, the Crumps,
[02:21:55.088 --> 02:22:09.272]  And deburers, others that run these big monopolies that go into these countries and kill innocent people to get the natural resources, the eugenics families, the UN, the World Health Organization that puts the poison in the vaccine.
[02:22:09.832 --> 02:22:18.594]  Yeah, they should be tried and charged with capital murder, and they should be taken, extradited to the country where they committed the crime.
[02:22:20.425 --> 02:22:25.388]  And they should be tried accordingly and charged accordingly according to the laws of those sovereign states.
[02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:34.854]  But to say Bill Clinton or Al Gore, I remember back when Bill Clinton was in office, he was a horrible, really obnoxious puppet.
[02:22:36.555 --> 02:22:39.276]  But people would call in, and it was acceptable.
[02:22:39.337 --> 02:22:44.760]  You'd hear it on national radio every day, saying the same thing J.Q.
[02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:46.421]  said, but saying it about Bill Clinton.
[02:22:46.461 --> 02:22:48.202]  And I would get on the air and say, no, no, no.
[02:22:49.341 --> 02:22:51.163]  I'm against that, because it's a puppet.
[02:22:52.664 --> 02:22:54.666]  It puts too much importance on that puppet.
[02:22:54.766 --> 02:22:58.149]  And if that happened, it would be fuel for the New World Order.
[02:22:58.730 --> 02:23:01.812]  Let's talk about the puppet masters, the real criminals.
[02:23:02.333 --> 02:23:03.354]  One last call in the news.
[02:23:04.735 --> 02:23:05.696]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.116 --> 02:23:07.738]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:08.658 --> 02:23:11.341]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:14.972 --> 02:23:16.773]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:23:16.953 --> 02:23:22.594]  I mean real, hard-to-find, all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:23:22.914 --> 02:23:23.775]  Probably never, right?
[02:23:24.055 --> 02:23:31.717]  Hey, folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to tell you about Alex94340 or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[02:23:41.363 --> 02:23:43.264]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:43.744 --> 02:23:46.585]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:50.046 --> 02:23:50.946]  All right, folks.
[02:23:51.726 --> 02:23:55.407]  Martin in Illinois.
[02:23:56.028 --> 02:23:57.228]  You're our last caller of the day.
[02:23:57.248 --> 02:24:01.789]  Then I'm going to jump into some final important news here on the hind end of the broadcast.
[02:24:02.650 --> 02:24:03.510]  Martin, you're on the air.
[02:24:03.530 --> 02:24:03.850]  Go ahead.
[02:24:04.449 --> 02:24:05.109]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:05.169 --> 02:24:06.210]  I've got a question for you.
[02:24:06.250 --> 02:24:11.132]  My brother saw on, I guess it's Illinois Route 80.
[02:24:11.332 --> 02:24:16.194]  Well, it's a big major route that goes east-west and goes to Chicago.
[02:24:16.214 --> 02:24:24.117]  He was driving, and he saw four buses pass him, and they were each about a quarter of a mile apart, and they were gray.
[02:24:24.377 --> 02:24:28.079]  He said they had absolutely no markings, no license plates, whatever, on them.
[02:24:29.319 --> 02:24:31.580]  And the only thing it said on them was Zill...
[02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:34.091]  Z-I-L, motor coach.
[02:24:34.951 --> 02:24:37.393]  And he said you couldn't see in the windows because of the tint.
[02:24:38.675 --> 02:24:41.517]  And I was wondering, have you ever heard of that motor coach company?
[02:24:41.557 --> 02:24:42.958]  He thought it was a Russian one.
[02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:45.440]  Say it again?
[02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:48.363]  Zill, Z-I-L, motor coach.
[02:24:50.125 --> 02:24:50.605]  Zill.
[02:24:51.946 --> 02:24:52.787]  That sounds German.
[02:24:53.444 --> 02:24:59.927]  Maybe it does, but isn't it illegal to drive on the highways or any of the roads without license plates?
[02:25:00.027 --> 02:25:03.268]  Well, they can get permits if something's leaving a factory.
[02:25:04.549 --> 02:25:06.030]  Did he say they look new?
[02:25:06.050 --> 02:25:07.630]  He didn't say.
[02:25:07.650 --> 02:25:09.011]  He just said they looked rather odd.
[02:25:10.452 --> 02:25:15.214]  Well, you know, again, it's all mainstream news, but it's the stuff of folk workers.
[02:25:15.234 --> 02:25:16.254]  People never check it out.
[02:25:16.874 --> 02:25:20.056]  But they've built giant camps, relocation centers.
[02:25:20.076 --> 02:25:22.277]  They've signed deals to bring in Czechoslovakian...
[02:25:23.609 --> 02:25:31.815]  And Mexican and Canadian and Dutch and other troops to literally oppress us and confiscate our guns during a crisis.
[02:25:31.935 --> 02:25:33.776]  Oh, our troops are tied down overseas.
[02:25:34.457 --> 02:25:40.781]  The chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chairman himself has said, we'll, quote, use foreign assets if our troops are pinned down.
[02:25:41.601 --> 02:25:45.144]  They've got the foreign F-16s and AWACS in the skies.
[02:25:46.625 --> 02:25:50.127]  Right before 9-1-1, we got the report, and all over the country,
[02:25:50.808 --> 02:25:56.010]  The feds were paying to have local police train on driving all the city buses.
[02:25:57.931 --> 02:26:02.473]  And they trained to put the riot police in them to go do roundups, to put people on buses.
[02:26:02.953 --> 02:26:04.534]  They trained for door-to-door pickups.
[02:26:05.815 --> 02:26:06.755]  This is the new system.
[02:26:06.775 --> 02:26:08.176]  This is all part of your new freedom.
[02:26:09.996 --> 02:26:15.639]  As I said, they're setting up the classical or the textbook tyranny
[02:26:17.622 --> 02:26:19.564]  He had thought possibly that there were some U.N.
[02:26:19.604 --> 02:26:21.905]  troops on those buses, just a speculation.
[02:26:21.925 --> 02:26:23.406]  Well, I mean, speculation.
[02:26:23.626 --> 02:26:29.030]  They had an operation last year from California to Nevada with the U.N., with U.N.
[02:26:29.130 --> 02:26:31.372]  armored vehicles and the takeovers.
[02:26:32.190 --> 02:26:34.691]  I got a bunch of mainstream news articles where they got foreign troops.
[02:26:34.731 --> 02:26:38.673]  I got video of foreign troops up close saying, where were the New World Order?
[02:26:38.733 --> 02:26:40.014]  We're here to take your guns.
[02:26:40.074 --> 02:26:42.255]  I mean, it's in my film Police State 2000.
[02:26:42.435 --> 02:26:43.836]  Okay, well, you know what?
[02:26:43.876 --> 02:26:45.036]  I just thought that was pretty odd.
[02:26:45.097 --> 02:26:52.480]  It's not something I've ever seen in my lifetime, and I thought that a lot of the factors involved there were kind of strange, and I kind of agree with them.
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:53.981]  They're probably up to something there.
[02:26:54.001 --> 02:26:56.842]  So, okay, I just wondered if you'd heard of that motor coach company.
[02:26:56.862 --> 02:26:57.843]  It sounds foreign to me.
[02:27:00.533 --> 02:27:03.435]  Oh, boy, that's interesting.
[02:27:03.495 --> 02:27:05.076]  No, I don't know anything about Zill.
[02:27:05.377 --> 02:27:05.937]  Anything else?
[02:27:06.737 --> 02:27:19.526]  No, I just thought it was rather maddening that people at the local level actually cooperate with a lot of the stuff that's going on, like with Homeland Security and a lot of unconstitutional stuff.
[02:27:20.687 --> 02:27:21.928]  Don't people have any conscience?
[02:27:21.948 --> 02:27:23.269]  Don't they know their Constitution?
[02:27:23.309 --> 02:27:28.853]  Even police officers and local people, I mean, why don't they say, no, I'm not going to do this, I'm not going to do that?
[02:27:30.134 --> 02:27:38.138]  I like removing Ten Commandments monuments from schools in small towns when the police stand by and protect the workers who are removing them.
[02:27:38.199 --> 02:27:39.179]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:27:39.959 --> 02:27:43.281]  But they're teaching Harry Potter everywhere and the borders are wide open.
[02:27:43.301 --> 02:27:43.962]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:43.982 --> 02:27:44.262]  Thank you.
[02:27:44.887 --> 02:27:47.450]  Yeah, it's all about thought crime now.
[02:27:47.690 --> 02:27:51.855]  What someone was thinking or something that makes someone upset.
[02:27:51.955 --> 02:27:58.343]  And then it's ignored when a SWAT team sprays the whole family the wrong house with machine gun bullets.
[02:27:58.903 --> 02:28:04.410]  That's a minor issue, but oh, we've got Ten Commandments at the courthouse.
[02:28:05.848 --> 02:28:09.309]  And, you know, when you know a little bit of history, stuff just stands out.
[02:28:09.329 --> 02:28:10.229]  Here's the New York Times.
[02:28:10.829 --> 02:28:13.390]  New top general tells legislators U.S.
[02:28:13.470 --> 02:28:16.450]  will probably need a larger army.
[02:28:16.471 --> 02:28:27.053]  A former special operations commander called for retirement to be army chief of staff today that the army is likely to need more troops to meet its worldwide needs.
[02:28:27.856 --> 02:28:28.436]  Commitments.
[02:28:28.616 --> 02:28:34.399]  General Peter J. Shoemaker appeared before Congress, and they're talking about a national draft.
[02:28:34.939 --> 02:28:42.822]  They've already submitted one for doctors to forcibly give them the smallpox and other shots and then forcibly give it to you.
[02:28:42.862 --> 02:28:44.803]  That's been announced two weeks ago.
[02:28:46.224 --> 02:28:50.285]  When you know a little history, General Shoemaker was over Waco.
[02:28:52.586 --> 02:28:56.028]  I've read General Shoemaker's memos on the air about their...
[02:28:57.123 --> 02:29:06.028]  Wet work there at Mount Carmel, the babies and toddlers that faced Delta Force.
[02:29:07.549 --> 02:29:20.497]  And the evidence came out, you know, they sent Delta Force in, they put a shape charge on top, the church records vault, the only concrete structure, as the tanks were ramming the walls and setting things on fire, and then the roof blows up.
[02:29:21.491 --> 02:29:29.954]  Blows up, and there's a big concrete hole, and there's video of it with the FBI in there, and the little kids were turned into mincemeat.
[02:29:31.015 --> 02:29:33.636]  And when the Davidians would try to leave, they would shoot them.
[02:29:35.096 --> 02:29:36.657]  This is days before they torched it.
[02:29:37.217 --> 02:29:41.259]  They had Constantino wire wrapped around the physical structure so you couldn't get out.
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:48.401]  And that's your New America, folks, and that's the general.
[02:29:48.541 --> 02:29:50.122]  So he's proven himself.
[02:29:51.610 --> 02:29:52.971]  He's a man of action.
[02:29:53.792 --> 02:29:59.356]  When it comes to burning down wooden churches and sending in troops to splatter babies, he'll do it.
[02:30:01.518 --> 02:30:07.322]  And, well, now the troops get a lot of experience doing that type of stuff.
[02:30:07.402 --> 02:30:11.986]  And his own Delta Force is ready to eat their own guts and ask for seconds.
[02:30:14.610 --> 02:30:16.251]  They have the Marine Corps chants.
[02:30:16.271 --> 02:30:22.334]  Of course, usually the Army, where they talk about how they'll kill children under orders, and they have chants about how the children gather around, mow them down.
[02:30:24.355 --> 02:30:27.457]  And, of course, his own Delta Force came back again last year.
[02:30:29.818 --> 02:30:41.504]  Four guys out of one unit and slaughtered their wives, and the police pulled up, according to the Associated Press, at one house, and one of them was flopping around on the ground, screaming hateful things, convulsing.
[02:30:42.623 --> 02:30:45.285]  The police described it like something out of the extra system.
[02:30:45.405 --> 02:30:46.326]  Nice forces.
[02:30:47.626 --> 02:30:49.828]  But I guess the wives deserved it, you know.
[02:30:50.749 --> 02:30:52.029]  I mean, you've got to support the troops.
[02:30:54.011 --> 02:30:58.293]  This is our new society, and they're going to have a special forces society.
[02:30:59.374 --> 02:31:02.336]  He's going to command the tens of thousands of mercenary forces.
[02:31:02.376 --> 02:31:04.237]  They're going to spend $100 to $200 billion a year.
[02:31:04.798 --> 02:31:05.618]  That's current spending.
[02:31:05.658 --> 02:31:09.441]  It fluctuates on mercenary forces.
[02:31:10.524 --> 02:31:12.407]  I could spend all day about Mr. Shoemaker.
[02:31:14.589 --> 02:31:17.774]  I guess General Baucus wasn't made of the same metal as this man.
[02:31:17.814 --> 02:31:19.676]  General Baucus wouldn't go along with stuff like that.
[02:31:19.696 --> 02:31:20.477]  He resigned.
[02:31:20.497 --> 02:31:24.903]  But hey, we have the new guy.
[02:31:26.946 --> 02:31:27.787]  And here's another one.
[02:31:28.027 --> 02:31:29.648]  Access to banks at stake.
[02:31:29.748 --> 02:31:31.809]  This is from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a U.S.
[02:31:31.829 --> 02:31:43.917]  Treasury Department decision to review government rules regarding an identification card issued by Mexico to its nationals overseas is threatening to exacerbate tensions between Washington and Mexico City.
[02:31:45.258 --> 02:31:53.984]  Now, Poland and Mexico and Venezuela and a bunch of others now issue their own matricula card, and 800-plus cities and towns accept it.
[02:31:55.077 --> 02:31:59.381]  And I'll watch an illegal walk right up with one of these cards and get a bank account in about 30 seconds.
[02:31:59.401 --> 02:32:09.168]  If you're a citizen, it says a security card, credit card, ID card, driver's license, W-2 form.
[02:32:09.188 --> 02:32:16.494]  I mean, I've been there opening a bank account, and there's an illegal alien right there, and the person walks out and talks in Spanish.
[02:32:16.534 --> 02:32:17.415]  My wife speaks Spanish.
[02:32:17.455 --> 02:32:18.135]  She was standing there with me.
[02:32:18.155 --> 02:32:18.776]  I said, what's he saying?
[02:32:19.637 --> 02:32:22.678]  Well, they're just saying, let us see your Mexican consulate card.
[02:32:22.718 --> 02:32:23.238]  That's fine.
[02:32:23.278 --> 02:32:26.478]  And he set up a bank account and deposited a paycheck and walked off.
[02:32:29.419 --> 02:32:31.019]  Because it's about breaking down the borders.
[02:32:31.079 --> 02:32:32.599]  Folks, they're not worried about all these illegals.
[02:32:32.619 --> 02:32:41.281]  They just want to get you, the producer, the citizen, the middle class citizen, whether you're Hispanic or black or white, under their thumb for control and taxation.
[02:32:41.941 --> 02:32:47.522]  And they just want to get the illegals up here and into the system and just get their hooks into them and make it easy for them.
[02:32:48.211 --> 02:32:50.393]  And then later, they can, of course, be enslaved fully.
[02:32:52.015 --> 02:32:57.781]  But right now, they just want that big third world voting bloc, whether they're from Russia or Mexico or China.
[02:32:59.142 --> 02:33:03.967]  So there's that, and the feds, under immense pressure, are just going to add a few regulations to it.
[02:33:04.187 --> 02:33:09.032]  It's really nothing but Mexico screaming bloody murder and saying, how dare you, this is racist.
[02:33:09.933 --> 02:33:10.913]  Oh, it's racist.
[02:33:11.413 --> 02:33:20.176]  If I'm caught without an ID and a passport in Mexico, you'll throw me in jail, beat me up, and extort tens of thousands of dollars out of my family.
[02:33:21.736 --> 02:33:27.818]  Illegal aliens that sneak into Mexico are put in open-air concrete sheds.
[02:33:27.858 --> 02:33:28.758]  This has been on the news.
[02:33:29.538 --> 02:33:32.059]  But that's okay for them to protect their sovereignty.
[02:33:33.259 --> 02:33:34.059]  It's so sick.
[02:33:34.079 --> 02:33:36.800]  It really is a joke, folks.
[02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:42.222]  Really is a sick joke.
[02:33:42.242 --> 02:33:46.985]  400 million Latin Americans, 20 million new births a year, coming this way.
[02:33:47.005 --> 02:33:49.867]  That's why we always talk about the people.
[02:33:49.887 --> 02:33:50.788]  I've gotten emails.
[02:33:50.808 --> 02:33:52.069]  They won't call, but I've gotten emails.
[02:33:52.089 --> 02:33:53.389]  It's usually white people, though.
[02:33:53.610 --> 02:33:57.792]  I'm a liberal, and why are you always criticizing Mexicans?
[02:33:58.073 --> 02:33:59.634]  Do you not like Mexicans?
[02:34:01.295 --> 02:34:07.419]  And I'm like, well, it just so happens to be a populous country, a 90-something million people south of us, and we don't have a border with them, and they're pouring in.
[02:34:10.715 --> 02:34:19.102]  And then up from there is a conduit of everybody else from Latin America, and they'll work for $4 an hour and drive down the wages.
[02:34:19.562 --> 02:34:21.183]  Well, they're the only ones that'll work.
[02:34:21.603 --> 02:34:22.604]  Folks, that's not true.
[02:34:23.125 --> 02:34:25.446]  But lettuce would cost $100 a head.
[02:34:25.506 --> 02:34:26.407]  That's ridiculous.
[02:34:27.768 --> 02:34:31.991]  All this does, having all this cheap labor, is drive down everybody's wages.
[02:34:33.493 --> 02:34:35.334]  Pretty soon the illegals are going to stop coming up here.
[02:34:35.374 --> 02:34:36.515]  In fact, it has slowed.
[02:34:37.398 --> 02:34:38.318]  I mean, it's horrible, folks.
[02:35:06.314 --> 02:35:14.759]  There's a few niche service industries where you can still make a little bit of a living, but pretty soon people won't be able to afford the service, so a lot of service companies are shutting down.
[02:35:19.502 --> 02:35:33.711]  There's an article, Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone, CBS News, and it says, when Jean Shaw gets together with her coworkers in Terre Haute, Indiana, they talk about the future and the future they never imagined.
[02:35:34.255 --> 02:35:37.337]  Where am I going to get a job paying a decent wage at 56 years old?
[02:35:37.837 --> 02:35:38.597]  Or can I start over?
[02:35:38.637 --> 02:35:41.799]  And it just goes into how the high-tech jobs are all leaving and ain't ever coming back.
[02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:48.302]  And, you know, we just have stacks of such articles here.
[02:35:49.343 --> 02:35:51.464]  Calls for Renewed Urgency and Terror War.
[02:35:51.484 --> 02:35:52.704]  This is the Financial Times.
[02:35:53.725 --> 02:35:56.006]  And the Coffee Annan, U.N.
[02:35:56.046 --> 02:35:57.747]  Secretary General on Tuesday...
[02:35:58.923 --> 02:36:05.508]  Appointed international regional organizations to inject a new sense of urgency in joint responses to terrorism.
[02:36:05.528 --> 02:36:10.572]  See, creating the global government, merging the governments, getting rid of the liberties, and they're all for it.
[02:36:10.892 --> 02:36:14.535]  You know, the UN told Iraq, accept our troops on the ground or we're going to invade you.
[02:36:15.115 --> 02:36:16.936]  You know, America the bad cop will get you.
[02:36:16.996 --> 02:36:18.878]  It's all, it's the same system, folks.
[02:36:18.898 --> 02:36:21.740]  It doesn't matter if it's left or right.
[02:36:22.563 --> 02:36:38.240]  Terrorism has been felt by the world's most powerful country, its biggest democracy, its largest state, its most populous Muslim nation, and the home of Islam's holiest sites, Mr. Anand told a meeting of more than 30 international organizations, including NATO, Interpol, and the League of Arab States.
[02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:38.881]  Excuse me.
[02:36:43.211 --> 02:36:53.037]  Let us not add to our burdens by descending into unproductive polarization as our world changes, our institutions must keep pace with these changes.
[02:36:53.657 --> 02:37:02.242]  And he calls for a big global anti-terror body and merging the laws and a federation of Arab states and a one currency to stop the terrorists.
[02:37:04.864 --> 02:37:05.084]  So...
[02:37:08.303 --> 02:37:10.324]  We need to, again, be worried about terrorism.
[02:37:10.364 --> 02:37:10.704]  Everything.
[02:37:10.764 --> 02:37:14.485]  Terrorism, terrorism, terrorism, terrorism, terrorism, terrorism, terrorism, terrorism.
[02:37:14.826 --> 02:37:15.826]  The terrorists are going to get you.
[02:37:15.846 --> 02:37:16.986]  You've got to give your rights up.
[02:37:17.026 --> 02:37:18.447]  The government's got to grow in size.
[02:37:18.747 --> 02:37:19.547]  You've got to surveil you.
[02:37:19.567 --> 02:37:20.488]  You've got to tax you.
[02:37:20.508 --> 02:37:21.628]  You've got to harass you.
[02:37:21.908 --> 02:37:27.511]  We're going to use all these new terror laws against all criminals or people who may be breaking laws.
[02:37:27.531 --> 02:37:29.611]  We're going to make misdemeanors an act of terror.
[02:37:29.911 --> 02:37:34.653]  We're going to make possessing methamphetamine your charge for producing a nuclear weapon.
[02:37:34.693 --> 02:37:36.254]  That was in the Associated Press last week.
[02:37:37.629 --> 02:37:41.891]  Ohio wants to use a law for terrorism for producing a nuclear weapon.
[02:37:42.251 --> 02:37:44.552]  Oh, they're going to apply that law to meth labs.
[02:37:47.373 --> 02:37:50.074]  It's all just crazy.
[02:37:52.075 --> 02:37:54.075]  And Tony Blair is in a lot of trouble.
[02:37:54.516 --> 02:37:57.117]  Blair hit hard by suicide scandal.
[02:37:57.157 --> 02:38:03.079]  Prime Minister and Minister under pressure to resign over death stress site is believed to have slashed his wrist.
[02:38:06.662 --> 02:38:22.329]  And it goes on to say, visibly shaken, Prime Minister Tony Blair has pleaded for restraint while facing tough questions about blood on his hands and the apparent suicide of leading British government scientists already reeling under the biggest political crisis of their premiership.
[02:38:22.809 --> 02:38:31.793]  The pressure on Blair increased significantly yesterday when a respected member of his own Labour Party, former Cabinet Minister Belinda Jackson, called for his resignation.
[02:38:32.894 --> 02:38:34.354]  And again, I don't have time to get into it.
[02:38:34.434 --> 02:38:35.395]  We've done past shows.
[02:38:36.149 --> 02:38:37.689]  Kelly was obviously murdered.
[02:38:37.849 --> 02:38:47.772]  All the evidence points there, he said he was being threatened, dark actors around him, he was going to get his good name back, he was going to go public, and then he dies a few hours later.
[02:38:49.092 --> 02:38:51.092]  And then they say day one, oh, it's suicide.
[02:38:51.132 --> 02:38:51.733]  We're sure.
[02:38:54.373 --> 02:38:55.113]  Just amazing.
[02:38:55.273 --> 02:39:01.195]  And Homeland Security is courting Silicon Valley, asking them to come up with new surveillance systems to track the American people.
[02:39:01.215 --> 02:39:02.635]  This is out of CNET News.
[02:39:05.055 --> 02:39:13.058]  The World Bank and IMF are calling for the world to accept genetically modified food to feed the world.
[02:39:13.238 --> 02:39:14.118]  Oh, isn't that nice?
[02:39:14.158 --> 02:39:19.200]  They're telling third world countries, no food aid if you don't take genetically modified food and plant it.
[02:39:19.724 --> 02:39:20.284]  We're good to go.
[02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:48.534]  From India to Peru, they would grab men, women, sterilize them.
[02:39:48.554 --> 02:39:49.836]  This is admitted, okay?
[02:39:50.036 --> 02:39:51.677]  Back of the newspaper, this is admitted.
[02:39:53.899 --> 02:39:56.082]  An amazing story out of the News of Australia.
[02:39:56.442 --> 02:39:59.925]  Dalai Lama misses sex and shooting guns.
[02:39:59.965 --> 02:40:01.006]  I just thought that was interesting.
[02:40:01.887 --> 02:40:02.908]  The Dalai Lama.
[02:40:02.928 --> 02:40:03.549]  Give me a break.
[02:40:04.207 --> 02:40:11.414]  Why do people pay attention to this guy, this quack who sold out to the communist Chinese and sold out his people?
[02:40:11.674 --> 02:40:17.099]  He talks about how much he liked Mao Zedong and how Mao Zedong was a father to him and fed him on his lap.
[02:40:17.839 --> 02:40:19.821]  Yeah, to manipulate the Tibetans, you idiot.
[02:40:20.462 --> 02:40:22.584]  And how he loves to shoot hawks with his...
[02:40:25.942 --> 02:40:27.662]  But, of course, it's okay for him to have guns.
[02:40:28.163 --> 02:40:30.723]  He doesn't want you to own guns, and it's bad, but he can have guns.
[02:40:30.783 --> 02:40:32.984]  And the liberals love Che Guevara.
[02:40:33.004 --> 02:40:36.104]  I know the communists can have guns, but just not the conservatives.
[02:40:36.144 --> 02:40:37.545]  Yeah, let us take over.
[02:40:37.625 --> 02:40:39.505]  See how hypocritical these people are?
[02:40:42.306 --> 02:40:43.306]  You want to free Tibet?
[02:40:43.386 --> 02:40:48.367]  Remove that moron twit, the Dalai Lama, that incarnated demon.
[02:40:51.423 --> 02:40:52.443]  Here's an amazing story.
[02:40:52.483 --> 02:40:55.204]  Palestinian boy organs give Israelis new life.
[02:40:55.244 --> 02:40:56.064]  This is from Reuters.
[02:40:56.104 --> 02:41:07.066]  The family of a Palestinian boy killed in an accident has helped save the lives of four Israeli children by donating his organs, a rare act, after 34 months of conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
[02:41:07.506 --> 02:41:09.266]  34 months, right?
[02:41:09.286 --> 02:41:09.606]  50 years.
[02:41:09.626 --> 02:41:18.288]  11-year-old Fatar Ade died when he fell off the roof of a home near Natalus in the West Bank.
[02:41:19.328 --> 02:41:19.908]  His family...
[02:41:20.635 --> 02:41:26.897]  It says, we want Israelis and Americans to know that while the Israeli army kills Palestinians, we give life to Israeli children.
[02:41:27.437 --> 02:41:28.058]  Wow!
[02:41:28.898 --> 02:41:30.539]  Specifically wanted it to go to Jews.
[02:41:31.759 --> 02:41:32.259]  We'll come back.
[02:41:32.299 --> 02:41:33.179]  We've got other key news.
[02:41:33.219 --> 02:41:33.660]  Stay with us.
[02:41:37.221 --> 02:41:40.082]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:42.101]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:41:42.301 --> 02:41:48.043]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:41:48.324 --> 02:41:53.586]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:41:53.866 --> 02:41:57.988]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:41:58.188 --> 02:42:01.973]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:42:02.233 --> 02:42:06.879]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:42:06.959 --> 02:42:13.227]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:42:13.287 --> 02:42:15.110]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:42:33.327 --> 02:42:35.349]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:42:36.101 --> 02:42:39.584]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:42:39.844 --> 02:42:43.347]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:42:43.428 --> 02:42:47.391]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:42:47.611 --> 02:42:53.777]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.177 --> 02:43:02.084]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:43:02.504 --> 02:43:07.849]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.

[02:44:37.305 --> 02:44:42.447]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:43.127 --> 02:44:57.113]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:44:58.514 --> 02:45:00.455]  All right, it's been looked up.
[02:45:01.155 --> 02:45:06.237]  And VIL was an old Russian company that made military transport vehicles.
[02:45:07.105 --> 02:45:12.009]  So when you see those driving around, there's been a lot of reports about the masked Russian equipment.
[02:45:12.810 --> 02:45:28.662]  A lot of it was to be sold to private collectors, but a lot of it's been stored at FEMA bases, at military bases, and then we have footage out of Fort Polk where they're storing a lot of it, with the Eastern Bloc troops being told they're forces of the New World Order by General John J. Sheehan.
[02:45:29.628 --> 02:45:32.049]  And he starts up there and goes, you are the forces of the New World Order.
[02:45:32.129 --> 02:45:35.930]  And then they go do urban warfare training with people going, I'm an American.
[02:45:35.970 --> 02:45:37.430]  No, please don't take my gun.
[02:45:37.530 --> 02:45:38.110]  I have rights.
[02:45:38.190 --> 02:45:38.871]  I'm a citizen.
[02:45:39.891 --> 02:45:41.671]  I mean, it's crazy, but it's going on.
[02:45:43.172 --> 02:45:45.032]  Man, I tell you, there's so much other news here.
[02:45:45.072 --> 02:45:45.832]  It's so important.
[02:45:45.892 --> 02:45:47.933]  Things are really escalating with North Korea.
[02:45:49.293 --> 02:45:55.175]  And it's now come out in Denver.
[02:45:55.828 --> 02:45:56.428]  We're good to go.
[02:45:56.448 --> 02:45:56.989]  We're good to go.
[02:46:22.923 --> 02:46:26.545]  Royalty while jailing thousands and keeping many hungry in a hellish nightmare.
[02:46:26.565 --> 02:46:27.505]  And boy, is that true.
[02:46:28.265 --> 02:46:31.547]  But again, the globalists will go in and just put in their own slave grid.
[02:46:32.207 --> 02:46:41.151]  It's higher level demons going after lower level demons and using the war to set up a police state here and install a national draft while they arm our enemies.
[02:46:43.251 --> 02:46:46.313]  And a big story, very important out of MSNBC.
[02:46:47.890 --> 02:46:49.951]  Biometric passports coming soon.
[02:46:50.452 --> 02:46:53.214]  Country scrambling to meet 2004 deadline.
[02:46:55.915 --> 02:47:05.282]  And it says that worldwide, they've got their little global treaties where we all have to have our face scan and thumb scan to get our driver's license, which then becomes our national ID card.
[02:47:05.302 --> 02:47:06.242]  That's MSNBC.
[02:47:06.262 --> 02:47:07.643]  I've been warning you about this for years.
[02:47:08.023 --> 02:47:10.185]  The UN's announced they want a world ID card.
[02:47:12.406 --> 02:47:14.928]  Just absolutely incredible.
[02:47:16.457 --> 02:47:26.259]  And there's a really racist law that Fox and the AP reported on, and they claim it's for security reasons, but it is elitism.
[02:47:27.699 --> 02:47:33.120]  And, you know, if you're going to say other cultures can't try to maintain their culture, then you can't say that about yourself.
[02:47:33.900 --> 02:47:37.741]  A new law bans Palestinians who marry Israeli Arabs from living in Israel.
[02:47:39.361 --> 02:47:43.102]  And though there's no track record of terrorists doing this to get into the country...
[02:47:45.271 --> 02:47:48.193]  What Jew is going to marry a terrorist just so they can kill people?
[02:47:49.214 --> 02:47:51.676]  But they say you can't marry an Israeli.
[02:47:52.197 --> 02:47:55.940]  By the way, Christians can't proselytize or preach in Israel.
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:47:56.320]  Do you know that?
[02:47:56.340 --> 02:47:56.921]  You get arrested?
[02:47:57.661 --> 02:48:06.388]  My only point is, I'm not against Israel, but I'm against saying Russia or China is bad, but then not saying Israel is a tyranny, folks.
[02:48:06.408 --> 02:48:09.110]  They are not a democracy as we hear.
[02:48:10.111 --> 02:48:12.153]  And very, very serious issues.
[02:48:13.118 --> 02:48:14.218]  And very, very scary.
[02:48:15.398 --> 02:48:18.839]  And about John Wayne, we posted this on Infowars.com.
[02:48:19.659 --> 02:48:27.801]  It's now come out from KGB files that Joseph Stalin ordered John Wayne to be assassinated in the early 1950s.
[02:48:27.841 --> 02:48:30.001]  In fact, hit teams came to Hollywood to kill him.
[02:48:30.021 --> 02:48:34.002]  The FBI came to try to protect Wayne, and Wayne said, I don't need help.
[02:48:34.082 --> 02:48:35.062]  I got my guns.
[02:48:37.042 --> 02:48:39.983]  And it goes into how...
[02:48:41.952 --> 02:48:48.173]  Wayne then relied upon a group of loyal stuntmen who infiltrated communist cells in America and learned a plot to kill him.
[02:48:49.354 --> 02:48:53.835]  He then gathered the stuntmen, went to the communist meetings, and had a huge fight.
[02:48:56.055 --> 02:48:57.315]  I should have covered this.
[02:48:59.336 --> 02:49:01.176]  They went and beat the communists up.
[02:49:01.196 --> 02:49:02.636]  You never even heard about it in the news.
[02:49:02.656 --> 02:49:06.557]  I mean, John Wayne knocked them upside the head.
[02:49:06.577 --> 02:49:07.638]  I love it.
[02:49:07.758 --> 02:49:08.298]  I love it!
[02:49:10.507 --> 02:49:16.369]  I love it so much, I never even got to the story, and I didn't even have time to plug my videos, which supports my show and what we do.
[02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:23.952]  If you believe in what we're doing, go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call the toll-free number and get my videos and show them to people.
[02:49:24.412 --> 02:49:25.132]  Have a good weekend.
[02:49:25.152 --> 02:49:26.293]  See you back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:49:26.553 --> 02:49:32.755]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:49:33.455 --> 02:49:37.257]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most...
