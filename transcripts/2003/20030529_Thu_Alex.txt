[00:00:03.917 --> 00:00:07.159]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:15.405]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:17.106]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.807 --> 00:00:18.988]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:20.389]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:21.489]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.694 --> 00:00:26.337]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.897 --> 00:00:30.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.581]  Wednesday, the 29th of May, 2003.
[00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:48.182]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.942 --> 00:00:50.163]  And I was wrong yesterday.
[00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.684]  I said Michael Hager, The Economist, was coming on yesterday.
[00:00:52.724 --> 00:00:53.844]  It was today.
[00:00:53.864 --> 00:01:00.126]  I wrote it down wrong in the book, so that's coming up in the second hour to talk about the economy, the dollar, where things are going in the future.
[00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:02.527]  He's a best-selling author and an expert.
[00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:04.268]  He's done some incredible forecasting.
[00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:12.511]  We have another guest coming on in Alabama and Georgia and other states in the South.
[00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:17.744]  They're having massive military checkpoints for the last three years in a row.
[00:01:17.804 --> 00:01:28.187]  Now, I've caught some of these on video here in Texas, but now they're routing the highway off the road, the cars, into the National Guard Armory.
[00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:32.569]  They are ransacking vehicles, literally foaming at the mouth.
[00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:40.432]  We have seen this over and over and over again, and we've got a guest coming on to talk about that, coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:01:43.232 --> 00:01:50.394]  This is what the National Seat Belt Use Initiative was all about that Bill Clinton funded with billions of dollars a year in 98.
[00:01:51.255 --> 00:02:02.178]  When you hear about a National Seat Belt Initiative, click it or ticket, it's about training the police, the public, and the military that there is no Fourth Amendment because it's, quote, for safety.
[00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:08.542]  So training you, there is no posse comitatus law against troops on the streets.
[00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:18.173]  It was going on before 9-1-1 and they said in their own government policy reports that they needed terror attacks to get the public to accept this.
[00:02:18.213 --> 00:02:19.094]  So that's coming up.
[00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:23.360]  Also, evidence is pouring out now that
[00:02:24.657 --> 00:02:39.506]  The Iraq report, the documents they got from Saddam, 8,000 plus pages have been cut out, now we're finding out they rewrote portions of that, rewrote other dossiers, total and complete lying fraud, in your face!
[00:02:41.152 --> 00:02:43.114]  Another article here out of Ohio.
[00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:45.277]  Students will scan for meals.
[00:02:45.357 --> 00:02:48.100]  They say cash and cash registers are outdated.
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.222]  So are meal tickets.
[00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:52.525]  If you want food, you've got to enroll and thumb scan.
[00:02:52.626 --> 00:03:01.256]  And yes, if your parents forget and don't put money in the credit card system, Child Protective Services will be called on you.
[00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.553]  And I have the Pentagon saying they want to know what we watch, who we talk to, what we eat.
[00:03:07.993 --> 00:03:11.955]  We'll all swipe national ID cards to buy and sell very soon.
[00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:13.096]  It's already unfolding.
[00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:20.199]  And this is simply training the youth for this total information awareness network system.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.301]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.522]  Folks, it's just, I've never seen such tyranny.
[00:03:25.582 --> 00:03:27.123]  It's just, it's in high gear.
[00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:40.287]  Also, durable orders drop, renews economic fears, Supreme Court ruling increases federal power, CIA, truck trailers in Iraq, had bioweapons labs, they're trying to say that now.
[00:03:40.948 --> 00:03:46.731]  Also, I heard Joyce Riley yesterday talk about a report that we covered a few years ago, but I think it's important to bring it back.
[00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:57.397]  And I actually went and didn't just get the news article, we dug out the actual National Security Council slash CIA report.
[00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:01.140]  We're posting this on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.582]  Brazil launches inquiry into U.S.
[00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:16.310]  population activities and it was a sponsored program using IMF World Bank money to forcibly sterilize half the women in Brazil and 13 other countries.
[00:04:18.453 --> 00:04:20.675]  They say 10, and you read into it, it's actually 13.
[00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:23.537]  So, that's coming up.
[00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:32.585]  Your government forced sterilizations through the vaccines, through other systems, admitted with Henry Kissinger and others involved.
[00:04:32.985 --> 00:04:35.387]  We have the actual 30-page report here.
[00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:37.328]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:40.251]  Al-Qaeda warns of threat to water supply.
[00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:42.172]  When you hear Al-Qaeda, that means CIA.
[00:04:42.212 --> 00:04:45.375]  They're going to get you unless you give all your rights up to them, and then still they're going to get you.
[00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.771]  Canada's SARS quarantine spreads a suburban high school.
[00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:50.851]  U.S.
[00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:53.131]  plans extended stay in Iraq, report says.
[00:04:53.151 --> 00:04:59.993]  A bunch of the so-called bombing suspects are dying in custody, so, you know, they weren't good patsies.
[00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:02.093]  The torture didn't work, so they went ahead and took them out.
[00:05:02.974 --> 00:05:04.034]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:04.214 --> 00:05:05.054]  Big show.
[00:05:05.214 --> 00:05:05.874]  Stay with us.
[00:05:06.474 --> 00:05:08.955]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:16.481]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:05:17.181 --> 00:05:24.683]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:32.166]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:36.607]  Potassium iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[00:05:36.847 --> 00:05:39.209]  It works by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:44.093]  This shields the thyroid and protects it from absorbing the radioactive iodine-131.
[00:05:44.293 --> 00:05:51.199]  There is only one emergency thyroid blocker formulated for babies, children, pets and adults, and that's Medical Corps Potassium Iodate.
[00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:54.662]  Best of all, unopened bottles can be stored for up to a decade.
[00:05:54.942 --> 00:05:58.345]  Order the official Medical Corps Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:06:03.712 --> 00:06:04.052]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:04.092 --> 00:06:06.896]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.551]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:06:15.751 --> 00:06:21.496]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:27.021]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:31.484]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:06:31.644 --> 00:06:35.428]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world for the military and the police are merged.
[00:06:35.688 --> 00:06:40.312]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:06:40.412 --> 00:06:43.154]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:06:43.474 --> 00:06:46.637]  Psychotic UN Population Control Plans and much, much more.
[00:06:46.697 --> 00:06:48.558]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:06:49.018 --> 00:06:51.100]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.463]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:55.543 --> 00:06:57.585]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:58.325 --> 00:07:02.708]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:04.810]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.571]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:06.751 --> 00:07:08.833]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.532]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:07:12.772 --> 00:07:18.516]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:07:18.757 --> 00:07:20.118]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:07:20.218 --> 00:07:23.900]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:30.145]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[00:07:30.285 --> 00:07:32.767]  The two most important protein superfoods known.
[00:07:33.107 --> 00:07:42.740]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water, normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.266]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:51.371]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease,
[00:07:51.391 --> 00:07:55.955]  Please listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley, Sunday evenings at 6 p.m.
[00:07:55.995 --> 00:07:57.396]  Central, 7 Eastern.
[00:07:57.616 --> 00:08:06.364]  Call 1-888-826-4448 to learn more or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[00:08:06.544 --> 00:08:09.167]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[00:08:09.187 --> 00:08:16.593]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:23.755]  We talk about real issues that affect you and your family.
[00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:27.517]  We expose the architecture of the New World Order.
[00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:33.862]  The dark citadels of control being built at every level of our society.
[00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:41.048]  The mindset of the globalists, their own policy reports, their own statements, their own publications.
[00:08:42.737 --> 00:08:47.961]  We expose their crimes that are blaring and are legion.
[00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:51.764]  I do this Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:52.144 --> 00:08:53.065]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:53.405 --> 00:09:00.030]  Central Standard Time and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time with a rebroadcast of the daytime show from 1 a.m.
[00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.970]  until 4 a.m.
[00:09:03.773 --> 00:09:07.275]  And my friends, again we have a guest coming up in about 23 minutes.
[00:09:09.472 --> 00:09:20.374]  I have video of military checkpoints, helicopters, troops searching vehicles from back in 1999 on video in my film, The Takeover.
[00:09:20.934 --> 00:09:26.175]  We know that the government's been getting rid of the law that bars them from doing this, Posse Comitatus.
[00:09:27.916 --> 00:09:36.958]  And now in Georgia and Alabama and other areas, they set up giant military checkpoints and they route traffic off the road through the National Guard armories.
[00:09:37.018 --> 00:09:38.298]  They search the vehicles.
[00:09:39.196 --> 00:09:42.721]  This is the new America, which we've got a guest coming up about that.
[00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:45.024]  Then I have Michael Hager coming on today.
[00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:45.825]  It wasn't yesterday.
[00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:49.610]  It's today, The Economist, to talk about the economy, obviously.
[00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:52.894]  And we're going to have wide-open phones.
[00:09:53.966 --> 00:10:00.790]  I heard Joyce Riley talking about the report out of Brazil yesterday, so I went and got the actual document.
[00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.771]  We're posting it on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:10:04.391 --> 00:10:08.774]  Of course, this has been out for years, but I think it's important to remind people of it.
[00:10:09.474 --> 00:10:11.535]  She reminded me when I heard her show yesterday morning.
[00:10:13.172 --> 00:10:38.685]  And I have the actual report put out by the National Security Agency and the CIA, Population and National Security, 30-page report where Dr. Kissinger and others talk about exterminating half of the third world's population through birth control, forced sterilization, and it's been going on since the mid-70s, tens of billions of dollars of your tax money to do it,
[00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:42.106]  And, uh, my friends, it's just amazing.
[00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:42.827]  Here's the headline.
[00:10:42.867 --> 00:10:44.467]  Brazil launches inquiry into U.S.
[00:10:44.508 --> 00:10:45.868]  population activities.
[00:10:46.849 --> 00:10:48.910]  Billions sterilized to meet U.S.
[00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:49.990]  policy objectives.
[00:10:50.410 --> 00:11:03.457]  The U.S.-sponsored program that resulted in the sterilization of nearly half of Brazil's women has prompted a formal congressional inquiry sponsored by more than 165 legislators from every political party that is represented in the Brazilian legislature.
[00:11:03.937 --> 00:11:08.180]  The investigation has ignited after information about a secret U.S.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:21.911]  National Security Council memorandum on American population control objectives in developing countries was published in the Journal of Brazil and other major newspapers in early May.
[00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:24.233]  Now, again, this goes back to the early 90s.
[00:11:24.273 --> 00:11:29.517]  We have the 30-page report directly off the Library of Congress.
[00:11:29.557 --> 00:11:32.599]  You can link through at Infowars.com and read it.
[00:11:34.187 --> 00:11:35.669]  And it goes on to say the U.S.
[00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:50.424]  foreign policy document officially known as National Security Study Memorandum 200 or NSSM 200 detailed a plan to target 13 large developing nations with intensive efforts to promote population policies that would allow the U.S.
[00:11:50.444 --> 00:11:54.609]  to run massive birth control and sterilization projects in those countries.
[00:11:56.391 --> 00:12:00.153]  And in Brazil alone, 44% of women were sterilized.
[00:12:00.713 --> 00:12:13.060]  Brazil, the study said, was placed on the list of 13 target nations, because it clearly dominates the continent of South America demographically, and its population was projected to equal that of the United States by the turn of the century.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:21.705]  This and the report, which was jointly prepared for the National Security Council in 1974 by Central Intelligence Agency and the Departments of State and Defense,
[00:12:22.478 --> 00:12:24.559]  And the Agency for International Development.
[00:12:24.599 --> 00:12:26.280]  This is what the Army does, folks.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.380]  Taking over your life.
[00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:34.244]  Suggest a growing power status for Brazil and Latin America and on the world scene over the next 25 years.
[00:12:34.304 --> 00:12:43.648]  The NSC report listed 12 other nations whose growth could give them increased political influence and which were also to be targeted under the International Population Program.
[00:12:43.989 --> 00:12:50.852]  Those are Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Indonesia, Turkey, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, the Philippines, Mexico, and Colombia.
[00:12:52.208 --> 00:13:02.614]  The document, which is over 200 pages in length, was written after a proposed World Population Plan of Action was denounced by large numbers of African and Latin American nations by the Vatican.
[00:13:03.514 --> 00:13:20.403]  During the UN Population Conference held in Bucharest in 1974, the formerly classified Strategically Strategy document was approved as an integral part of American foreign policy in 1975 by Brent Scrocroft, who served as then-President Gerald Forrest's Secretary Advisor.
[00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:25.158]  And it says he occupies the same office, of course, in the first Bush administration.
[00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:33.263]  Reports about the document as well as about the Brazilian inquiry have since appeared in every part of Brazil and throughout Central and South America.
[00:13:35.124 --> 00:13:41.968]  And the report goes on to say that they wanted a sterilization of half the women in the country
[00:13:43.675 --> 00:13:45.437]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:13:45.497 --> 00:13:57.347]  Brazil's Ministry of Health, which had begun an investigation of the sterilization program before the American Population Strategy documents were disclosed, has revealed that 44% of all Brazilian women between the ages of 14 and 55 have been permanently sterilized.
[00:13:57.727 --> 00:14:02.351]  The older women apparently had the operation done when the program started nearly two decades ago.
[00:14:03.169 --> 00:14:08.093]  News reports charge that many of these women underwent the operation without their knowledge or consent.
[00:14:08.613 --> 00:14:19.541]  Of course, the UN is involved in this too and was part of the forced sterilization of tens of millions of men who were castrated over the last 30 years in India under UN funding.
[00:14:21.602 --> 00:14:25.605]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:14:25.745 --> 00:14:26.886]  So this is the mindset.
[00:14:26.906 --> 00:14:29.228]  So you go ahead and take your vaccines, America.
[00:14:30.396 --> 00:14:34.779]  People wonder why the male sperm count is down by 76% as of 2000.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.002]  I haven't seen the numbers in 2001 yet or 2002.
[00:14:38.102 --> 00:14:40.103]  They come out years after.
[00:14:41.384 --> 00:14:44.186]  Europe's sperm count is down by 80 plus percent.
[00:14:46.408 --> 00:14:54.274]  I know dozens of women that are friends of the family who are healthy, who don't use drugs, who are 30 years old, who cannot have children.
[00:14:55.798 --> 00:14:58.100]  Europe's population in some cities is off by 50%.
[00:14:59.381 --> 00:15:04.324]  Overall, in the next 30 years, Europe will lose about 40% of its population.
[00:15:05.025 --> 00:15:08.647]  Whole cities are ghost towns now in Germany and France and England.
[00:15:09.468 --> 00:15:12.090]  They're replacing them with immigrants from the third world.
[00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.772]  So you can see what the policies have done.
[00:15:14.812 --> 00:15:16.773]  It's not just in Africa and Latin America.
[00:15:16.793 --> 00:15:18.654]  So you go ahead and take your tetanus shot.
[00:15:19.395 --> 00:15:24.098]  You go ahead and give your daughter that tetanus shot and you wonder why she can't give you grandchildren 15, 20 years from now.
[00:15:25.934 --> 00:15:27.935]  Okay, no grandchildren for you!
[00:15:27.955 --> 00:15:31.017]  No grandchildren for you!
[00:15:31.037 --> 00:15:40.083]  And by the way, the 30-page report goes in to details of how to do this.
[00:15:41.564 --> 00:15:51.270]  They're doing it through vaccines, through forced sterilization, and a lot of the contraceptives they implant in people through the big parenting so-called centers.
[00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.471]  They're sterilizing people.
[00:15:53.524 --> 00:16:00.148]  You are totally insane if you take anything from the medical establishment, if you believe anything they do or say.
[00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:01.089]  You are nuts!
[00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:02.750]  You are off your rocker!
[00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:10.914]  Again, last week I read all the mainstream news articles about five times more likely to have autism or brain damage from MMR.
[00:16:12.435 --> 00:16:20.240]  They found cancer viruses, bizarre synthetic hormones that sterilize all this garbage in the vaccines.
[00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:26.042]  They admit the anthrax shots they gave the troops made a bunch of them die or become ill.
[00:16:26.282 --> 00:16:28.284]  They admit the plant had been ordered shut down.
[00:16:28.624 --> 00:16:29.305]  But they didn't care.
[00:16:29.345 --> 00:16:30.285]  They're still injecting.
[00:16:31.786 --> 00:16:38.411]  It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:16:39.913 --> 00:16:40.993]  Yes, it's horrifying.
[00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:42.074]  Yes, it's terrifying.
[00:16:42.374 --> 00:16:43.856]  Why don't we start telling the truth?
[00:16:44.116 --> 00:16:47.598]  Why don't we stand up and say no to all this trash and do it now?
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.801]  There's another article, a newer one.
[00:16:51.952 --> 00:17:06.635]  The government has taken two hundred billion dollars of your tax money backing up IMF and World Bank loans to the dictators of the third world who were ordered not to pay back the loans.
[00:17:06.935 --> 00:17:13.657]  Then they signed deals for forced sterilization and inoculation programs to carry this out.
[00:17:14.197 --> 00:17:19.718]  This is another National Security Memorandum mainstream, but they're counting on you not to read it.
[00:17:20.501 --> 00:17:26.084]  Little known agency for international development project seeks to turn block corporate assets into birth control funds.
[00:17:26.104 --> 00:17:26.344]  The U.S.
[00:17:26.364 --> 00:17:41.811]  government has contracted with a large accounting firm, this is from 1992 folks, to negotiate the release of up to 200 billion in block corporate assets located in developing countries and to buy off massive, that's a quote from the document, amounts of foreign debt in exchange for capital to extend the U.S.
[00:17:41.851 --> 00:17:43.011]  population program.
[00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:46.393]  The effort, which was launched in 91 under President Bush,
[00:17:47.737 --> 00:17:56.941]  Theoretically produced billions of dollars which would be funneled into secretive activities to compel the use of birth control by millions of people in the developing world, including sterilization.
[00:17:57.482 --> 00:17:59.583]  The first contracts were in the billions.
[00:18:00.563 --> 00:18:10.508]  And it goes on here to explain how they do it and guess who the accounting firm is that did the deal.
[00:18:10.608 --> 00:18:13.349]  Deloitte and Touche, again tied in with Enron and others.
[00:18:14.904 --> 00:18:16.005]  And Arthur Anderson.
[00:18:16.065 --> 00:18:17.926]  I mean, it just never ends, folks.
[00:18:18.146 --> 00:18:19.486]  It never ends.
[00:18:20.887 --> 00:18:24.449]  By the way, population growth is now massively slowing.
[00:18:24.489 --> 00:18:25.930]  The West is dying.
[00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:29.251]  It's incredible.
[00:18:29.871 --> 00:18:32.153]  It is absolutely incredible.
[00:18:32.873 --> 00:18:35.894]  So, I told my webmaster to post this.
[00:18:35.955 --> 00:18:36.775]  It's being posted.
[00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:38.496]  May already be posted.
[00:18:38.836 --> 00:18:42.138]  Population and National Security, the 30-page report by the CIA.
[00:18:43.672 --> 00:18:45.213]  This is mainstream.
[00:18:46.414 --> 00:18:46.774]  Hear that?
[00:18:48.656 --> 00:18:50.037]  Right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:50.577 --> 00:18:53.099]  And then you can read the news articles out of Brazil and other countries.
[00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:55.020]  This is your loving government.
[00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:57.522]  You go ahead and care about them.
[00:18:57.542 --> 00:18:59.123]  You go ahead and do whatever they say.
[00:18:59.143 --> 00:18:59.823]  Okay?
[00:18:59.843 --> 00:19:01.805]  They're going to take good care of you.
[00:19:03.504 --> 00:19:05.826]  Got some interesting articles here today.
[00:19:05.946 --> 00:19:07.708]  Bomb suspect dies in custody.
[00:19:07.748 --> 00:19:08.468]  London Guardian.
[00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:14.674]  The man who allegedly organized suicide bombings that killed 43 in Casablanca 12 days ago has died in police custody, officials said.
[00:19:14.694 --> 00:19:18.937]  This is the death of Abdullah Mousabata.
[00:19:19.478 --> 00:19:21.640]  Was blamed on heart and liver problems.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.364]  Oh, it says he died while they were interrogating him, but it's all accidental.
[00:19:28.155 --> 00:19:32.920]  Yeah, just like Lee Harvey Oswald got gunned down being let out in the parking garage.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.021]  Got to get rid of the patsies.
[00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:37.124]  Pentagon Report, New Guantanamo suicide attempts.
[00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:38.705]  That brings the number up to 27.
[00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:41.187]  And there's been some deaths too.
[00:19:41.307 --> 00:19:46.873]  And General Baucus, the head of the camp, resigned saying he wouldn't torture 12-year-olds.
[00:19:47.674 --> 00:19:48.835]  That doesn't seem to matter.
[00:19:48.895 --> 00:19:52.876]  They've got a new general and the article in Reuters on Monday.
[00:19:53.576 --> 00:19:54.217]  Death camps.
[00:19:54.317 --> 00:19:54.577]  U.S.
[00:19:54.617 --> 00:19:55.757]  announces death camps.
[00:19:56.137 --> 00:19:56.978]  Nothing like freedom.
[00:19:57.518 --> 00:19:58.158]  Death camps.
[00:19:58.758 --> 00:19:59.479]  Doesn't scare me.
[00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:00.519]  It makes me mad.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.080]  Don't worry.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:08.102]  Once they get the police state set up, they say there'll be dozens of mandatory vaccines for you!
[00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:13.103]  It's here.
[00:20:13.384 --> 00:20:14.104]  It's powerful.
[00:20:14.404 --> 00:20:22.968]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.269 --> 00:20:25.129]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.471]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[00:20:27.731 --> 00:20:31.953]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[00:20:32.253 --> 00:20:37.960]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.922]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[00:20:40.082 --> 00:20:43.326]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[00:20:43.506 --> 00:20:45.068]  Get the powerful Berkey now.

[00:20:58.282 --> 00:21:00.404]  Not yet available in California and Iowa.

[00:22:08.914 --> 00:22:12.576]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:12.996 --> 00:22:18.418]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:19.959]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:22:19.999 --> 00:22:24.021]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:24.697 --> 00:22:37.989]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:38.509 --> 00:22:43.814]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:44.114 --> 00:22:49.999]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:00.120]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:08.277 --> 00:23:11.919]  How many of you listening would give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[00:23:12.439 --> 00:23:13.279]  Listen up, folks.
[00:23:13.399 --> 00:23:16.821]  If you're taking vitamins in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:23:17.201 --> 00:23:22.583]  You see, according to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are just 10% absorbed.
[00:23:22.923 --> 00:23:27.546]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, you're literally flushing $90 down the toilet.
[00:23:28.806 --> 00:23:35.030]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, and if you want to start absorbing the nutrients that you swallow, you need to take Sea Silver.

[00:23:57.585 --> 00:23:57.685]  1-888-887-2063.
[00:23:57.965 --> 00:24:00.627]  Isn't it time you stopped flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[00:24:00.647 --> 00:24:00.707]  1-888-887-2063.
[00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:37.743]  Folks, you've been listening to the show for four or five years, six years some of you, some of you eight years, you live here in Austin.
[00:24:37.924 --> 00:24:39.625]  And you know I don't make stuff up.
[00:24:39.765 --> 00:24:44.348]  I post the documents on InfoWars.com for the five years we've had the website.
[00:24:45.638 --> 00:24:48.901]  We tell the truth here, and I'm sorry if the truth is scary.
[00:24:50.001 --> 00:24:53.064]  But truth is stranger than fiction, and you had better wake up.
[00:24:53.084 --> 00:24:57.667]  I mean, the evil is spiraling out of control.
[00:24:58.368 --> 00:25:01.110]  Now is the time to stand up for America.
[00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:02.951]  We have got to do it now!
[00:25:04.553 --> 00:25:06.254]  We could not wait any longer.
[00:25:06.894 --> 00:25:08.796]  The government is setting a precedent
[00:25:09.392 --> 00:25:27.808]  To produce vaccines at just a few plants, companies that own the military industrial complex, that are owned by the big banks, they are sterilizing us and brain damaging us, changing our DNA, in a massive program of eugenics, and we have their own documents!
[00:25:28.869 --> 00:25:35.395]  For the love of humanity, I pray that you will wake up
[00:25:36.187 --> 00:25:42.012]  And that you will face the horror and together we can spread the word and save America!
[00:25:43.593 --> 00:25:46.475]  But ignorance is holding up this scaffolding of evil.
[00:25:47.756 --> 00:25:50.778]  The average doctor giving you the shot is mandated by the AMA.
[00:25:50.798 --> 00:25:53.721]  It's not a law, but he will try to bully you into it.
[00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:55.302]  How dare you question him?
[00:25:55.322 --> 00:25:57.303]  The AMA says it's good.
[00:25:57.363 --> 00:25:58.244]  It must be good.
[00:25:58.264 --> 00:26:02.948]  The AMA is a corporate body owned by the military-industrial complex.
[00:26:03.931 --> 00:26:05.612]  And it's compartmentalization!
[00:26:05.992 --> 00:26:16.675]  Only the people working at the vaccine plants at the higher levels, only a few hundred, know what they're doing, and they're all CIA!
[00:26:18.455 --> 00:26:22.296]  Many of them are Nazis, ladies and gentlemen, literally!
[00:26:24.217 --> 00:26:29.078]  We are under attack, ladies and gentlemen, and you've got to face the facts!
[00:26:30.118 --> 00:26:31.939]  The head of the University of, uh...
[00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:40.057]  University of Illinois scientists medical school went public about the vaccines with the cancer viruses and all the trash.
[00:26:40.537 --> 00:26:45.320]  More people are standing up and saying the world is round not flat.
[00:26:46.301 --> 00:26:52.004]  The problem is they're going to carry out more terror and they're going to say you got to take all these injections.
[00:26:52.924 --> 00:26:55.146]  Thank the good Lord above that
[00:26:56.306 --> 00:27:01.408]  The mass of doctors and police and firemen refused the smallpox shot.
[00:27:01.688 --> 00:27:03.949]  They were going to then have them forcibly inject you.
[00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:08.090]  They passed the law, but it's an illegitimate criminal law.
[00:27:09.911 --> 00:27:18.814]  We are not going to take their injections, so now I'm reading hundreds of reports a month where they're moving to engineer the vaccines into the food supply.
[00:27:18.854 --> 00:27:23.796]  They're already trying to ship pharmacological corn, pharmacological
[00:27:25.071 --> 00:27:35.679]  ...beets, pharmacological rutabaga, pharmacological all this stuff, to Africa with the trash in it!
[00:27:35.859 --> 00:27:40.242]  And Africa is dying in mass, panicking, refusing the food.
[00:27:41.783 --> 00:27:44.285]  Everything is just bonkers, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:44.325 --> 00:27:47.787]  We are under massive attack.
[00:27:48.484 --> 00:27:54.867]  By what can only be described as pit of Hades, say, panic forces.
[00:27:57.848 --> 00:28:00.349]  I mean, it just freaks me out every day to do this show.
[00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:03.070]  I cannot believe how insane things have gotten.
[00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:05.311]  And the stuff I forget about.
[00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:17.957]  I mean, I had forgotten about the policy report that's been public for over a decade, where they said they want to sterilize half the women in 13 third world countries, and now they did it, they carried it out.
[00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:28.443]  And to have this published report, where they talk about forced sterilizations, and to have all these articles that just... Oh, how do you deal with it?
[00:28:29.023 --> 00:28:29.723]  I don't know!
[00:28:29.743 --> 00:28:33.524]  But I'm glad I know the truth.
[00:28:33.564 --> 00:28:34.725]  I'm just glad I know the truth.
[00:28:34.745 --> 00:28:40.207]  I'm glad I'm aware of what's happening, and I'm glad that more of you are waking up every day, because this is just insane.
[00:28:41.327 --> 00:28:43.888]  This is totally out of control at every level.
[00:28:45.929 --> 00:28:48.310]  What they're setting up is so horrible, America.
[00:28:49.266 --> 00:28:51.327]  What they're doing to this country makes me so mad.
[00:28:51.367 --> 00:28:52.348]  I mean, look at this article.
[00:28:52.368 --> 00:28:56.790]  I've been warning you now for four years about this since we first learned of it in Pennsylvania.
[00:28:57.931 --> 00:28:59.271]  This is out of Ohio.
[00:28:59.351 --> 00:29:02.693]  Texas schools, dozens of school districts in Texas alone are doing it.
[00:29:03.113 --> 00:29:05.695]  Thousands total worldwide from England to the U.S.
[00:29:06.115 --> 00:29:07.856]  Students will scan for meals.
[00:29:08.977 --> 00:29:10.417]  This is out of the Beacon Journal.
[00:29:11.398 --> 00:29:13.159]  Students will scan for meals.
[00:29:13.739 --> 00:29:15.660]  Akron students will be fingerprinted beginning this fall.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.121]  Identify them in school lunch lines.
[00:29:17.919 --> 00:29:27.362]  After a lengthy debate, a school board members voted 5-2 Tuesday to spend $700,000 on a controversial modernization cafeteria system that's, by the way, federally funded.
[00:29:27.782 --> 00:29:36.684]  Board members Rebecca Himenbaugh and Mary Stomer voted no, mirroring the concerns of parents about the cost of privacy issue involving the fingerprinting of students.
[00:29:37.745 --> 00:29:45.747]  I don't believe that any parent or student has ever had the expectation that in order to go through the lunch line or to buy a cookie or carton of milk,
[00:29:46.463 --> 00:29:49.544]  They or their children would be requested to be fingerprinted first.
[00:29:50.204 --> 00:29:50.925]  Said him, Baugh.
[00:29:51.345 --> 00:29:54.646]  He says she'll probably refuse to have her three children in Akron schools fingerprinted.
[00:29:54.946 --> 00:29:56.907]  The school says we're getting rid of the cash registers.
[00:29:57.187 --> 00:29:58.207]  You're gonna do it!
[00:30:00.748 --> 00:30:01.669]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.129 --> 00:30:03.730]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:07.351]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.535 --> 00:30:13.136]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:30:13.397 --> 00:30:19.140]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.740]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:30:20.841 --> 00:30:22.241]  In fact... New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:22.261 --> 00:30:22.782]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:30:22.802 --> 00:30:24.022]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.403]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:41.627]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:49.842 --> 00:30:50.582]  All right, folks.
[00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:54.564]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, I'm here live and back from 9 to midnight.
[00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:59.946]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Austin, Texas to Rochester, New York to Northern California.
[00:31:00.346 --> 00:31:11.830]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20, and at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90, and the internet at InfoWars.com and net.
[00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:14.911]  Coming up in the middle of the next hour, we do have Michael Hager coming on.
[00:31:14.931 --> 00:31:16.112]  It was today that he was coming on.
[00:31:16.152 --> 00:31:17.572]  The economist, best-selling author.
[00:31:17.893 --> 00:31:18.833]  Talk about the economy.
[00:31:19.662 --> 00:31:27.207]  We're about to go to Bill McFallin, who's in Alabama, who has seen these massive military checkpoints with the black helicopters, the whole nine yards.
[00:31:27.247 --> 00:31:30.569]  We've gotten these on video in Texas, but they're intensifying it.
[00:31:30.629 --> 00:31:38.274]  It's been going on since before 9-1-1, and during the click it or ticket system, the Army directed people into the National Guard armory.
[00:31:38.594 --> 00:31:40.215]  That's coming up in just one moment.
[00:31:41.796 --> 00:31:45.439]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, I want to tell you about HerbalHealer.com.
[00:31:46.439 --> 00:31:48.801]  Folks, they are the most
[00:31:49.745 --> 00:31:57.312]  Expansive, complete, herbal and naturopathic organization I know of in existence.
[00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:58.113]  They've been around since 1987.
[00:32:00.684 --> 00:32:09.611]  The FDA has been going after vitamin stores that even sell vitamin C. They are one of the few organizations to beat the FDA in court.
[00:32:09.651 --> 00:32:13.854]  They just did this trying to stop them from teaching their naturopathic courses.
[00:32:14.655 --> 00:32:17.597]  Ancient knowledge that's been passed on.
[00:32:18.198 --> 00:32:22.961]  They've got books for your region on naturally occurring treatments and cures.
[00:32:24.743 --> 00:32:25.563]  It's ridiculous.
[00:32:25.603 --> 00:32:27.385]  I'm looking at their catalog here, folks.
[00:32:28.283 --> 00:32:31.146]  This thing is a hundred pages long.
[00:32:31.986 --> 00:32:37.391]  They've got natural remedies to get the parasites out of your body that most people have.
[00:32:38.552 --> 00:32:45.838]  Apple Cider Vinegar Plus, Formula One, Super X, herbs.
[00:32:46.659 --> 00:32:47.840]  Folks, it goes on and on.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.902]  Correspondence courses.
[00:32:50.642 --> 00:32:52.744]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:54.846]  Just get the free catalog or you're insane.
[00:32:55.663 --> 00:32:56.926]  Get the free catalog.
[00:32:57.407 --> 00:32:58.549]  Find out what's in it.
[00:32:59.771 --> 00:33:01.033]  Order some of the materials.
[00:33:01.194 --> 00:33:02.696]  This is important knowledge.
[00:33:03.778 --> 00:33:04.980]  Water filters are important.
[00:33:05.542 --> 00:33:06.503]  Guns are important.
[00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:08.447]  Owning some land is important.
[00:33:09.088 --> 00:33:12.110]  Knowing how to feed your family off the land in your area.
[00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:16.253]  Natural treatments that have been around for 10,000 years.
[00:33:16.873 --> 00:33:18.254]  Stuff like this.
[00:33:18.274 --> 00:33:22.577]  Herbal Healer Correspondence Program, Herbal Healer Academy.
[00:33:22.977 --> 00:33:24.098]  Give them a call right now.
[00:33:24.118 --> 00:33:25.499]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:33:28.491 --> 00:33:29.172]  870-269-4177 or HerbalHealer.com.

[00:33:29.872 --> 00:33:30.712]  Get the free catalog.
[00:33:30.732 --> 00:33:31.672]  Get the free newsletter.
[00:33:31.692 --> 00:33:32.272]  Call them today.
[00:33:32.292 --> 00:33:32.372]  870-269-4177.
[00:33:32.412 --> 00:33:34.413]  Now, we're joined by Bill McFallin.
[00:33:52.990 --> 00:34:12.759]  And he's done a couple other interviews I'm told and he lives in Alabama and I've gotten a bunch of other calls from listeners in the last week since they had the clicker ticket checkpoints about military involved in checkpoints from Vermont to South Texas, from California to New York, from Florida to Alabama.
[00:34:13.779 --> 00:34:14.580]  And here it is!
[00:34:16.158 --> 00:34:20.439]  I have video of this in the takeover, them searching vehicles, part of the highway shut down.
[00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:22.780]  In Police State 2000, I have the highway shut down.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:30.122]  In the Road to Tyranny, I interview a Marine who in 88 was kicking down gun dealers' doors in a police uniform.
[00:34:30.383 --> 00:34:35.664]  Never been in the police as a military SWAT team guy.
[00:34:35.704 --> 00:34:39.205]  They've been getting rid of posse comitatus quietly for a long time.
[00:34:39.545 --> 00:34:44.467]  Now they shut down highways, shunt traffic into a National Guard armory off the side of the road in Alabama.
[00:34:44.967 --> 00:34:49.951]  Search your vehicle, helicopters in the air, has nothing to do with seatbelts.
[00:34:50.011 --> 00:35:07.866]  The federal plan, the National Seatbelt Use Initiative plan, part three of the four-part plan, we have the documents in Police State 2000, says that the seatbelt check is the excuse to search your vehicle and to train people to accept internal checkpoints and tolls.
[00:35:09.998 --> 00:35:13.459]  And thus, they now have seen, quote, citizen volunteers out at these.
[00:35:13.559 --> 00:35:15.019]  Folks, this is horrible.
[00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:17.839]  This is worse than Russia, what they're setting up.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.420]  This is totally un-American.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.840]  And joining me is Bill McFaulin.
[00:35:24.761 --> 00:35:29.501]  Bill, tell us exactly what you saw, because I've been getting a lot of calls on this issue in the last week.
[00:35:30.542 --> 00:35:32.062]  Tell us exactly what you witnessed.
[00:35:32.082 --> 00:35:33.662]  You say you witnessed this years ago.
[00:35:33.722 --> 00:35:34.842]  We heard about it years ago.
[00:35:35.202 --> 00:35:37.803]  Absolutely, and I moved to Alabama three years ago, and
[00:35:39.646 --> 00:35:40.627]  U.S.
[00:35:40.647 --> 00:35:49.434]  331 goes north to south through the middle of Alabama down to the Florida coast in the Destin Fort Walton Beach area.
[00:35:50.015 --> 00:35:58.342]  The roadblocks have occurred roughly 40 miles south of Montgomery, Alabama in the town of Brantley.
[00:35:58.842 --> 00:36:02.405]  They have a huge National Guard armory that sits off to the right side of U.S.
[00:36:02.425 --> 00:36:03.346]  331 going north.
[00:36:05.457 --> 00:36:07.879]  By the way, folks, this is a round-up drill.
[00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:08.479]  Go ahead.
[00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:09.260]  Yes, Lee.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:19.847]  Two years ago, I was coming back from Montgomery, pulling a 16-foot trailer full of pipe, and we saw a hand-painted sign.
[00:36:20.427 --> 00:36:25.950]  My neighbor was 76 years old at the time and was with me to take a day trip to get away from home.
[00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:34.456]  We noticed a hand-painted, five-by-five plywood sign that was placed beside the highway.
[00:36:35.169 --> 00:36:39.714]  And it was white with black hand-painted letters that was done with a paintbrush.
[00:36:40.415 --> 00:36:41.716]  And it said, Roadblock Ahead.
[00:36:42.977 --> 00:36:46.741]  We looked at it and both commented it must be a high school prank.
[00:36:46.961 --> 00:36:48.743]  It must be high school kids doing something.
[00:36:50.425 --> 00:36:51.806]  It was not professionally done.
[00:36:52.107 --> 00:36:58.193]  A few hundred yards past that was another sign that said, Roadblock Just Ahead.
[00:36:59.989 --> 00:37:07.254]  Rounded a curve and there were several state, federal, police officers, vehicles.
[00:37:09.075 --> 00:37:10.837]  Many of the people were armed with M-16s.
[00:37:11.637 --> 00:37:16.981]  They had a black helicopter circling overhead with an M-60 machine gun stuck out the door.
[00:37:18.062 --> 00:37:22.945]  And they were systematically stopping cars and trucks.
[00:37:23.485 --> 00:37:27.488]  The car in front of me had an elderly couple that appeared to be in their late 70s, early 80s.
[00:37:28.928 --> 00:37:29.848]  Both had white hair.
[00:37:30.609 --> 00:37:32.170]  They were driving a white new Volvo.
[00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:36.952]  They were pulled over and made to get out of their vehicle.
[00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:41.374]  The traffic was stopped on 331 South at this time.
[00:37:41.994 --> 00:37:50.718]  And it was rather sobering to see all of the federal people as well as state and local that were taking part in this.
[00:37:50.758 --> 00:37:52.359]  You also mentioned National Guard.
[00:37:52.439 --> 00:37:54.460]  And there were National Guard people there with M-16s.
[00:37:57.566 --> 00:38:02.187]  We were allowed to pass through, although we drove very, very slowly after the stop.
[00:38:02.327 --> 00:38:04.728]  Yeah, they just randomly pick cars out.
[00:38:05.068 --> 00:38:07.249]  They stop the Volvo with the old people.
[00:38:07.389 --> 00:38:14.311]  They stop the Volvo with a very old couple in it, and as we drove slowly past them... Those who don't know, they will have CIA...
[00:38:15.151 --> 00:38:25.160]  FEMA operators, the type listeners you've seen in the road to tyranny, in Kansas City teaching a classroom of police that quote, Christians, founding fathers are terrorists, so what if they have to die?
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:30.164]  We have the training manuals, constitutionalist homeschoolers, and you look conservative!
[00:38:30.724 --> 00:38:31.845]  We've seen these happen.
[00:38:31.865 --> 00:38:35.086]  If you've got a giant turbine on your head, you speed through.
[00:38:35.106 --> 00:38:43.809]  The FEMA directors on the ground will direct the young troops and the police to go after Middle America.
[00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.670]  This is training them.
[00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:46.751]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:38:47.151 --> 00:38:57.155]  Yes, the troops and the police officers looked inside my vehicle as we were driving at two to three miles per hour through the checkpoint.
[00:38:57.699 --> 00:39:06.287]  They were lined up in the median of the highway, as well as on the shoulder, looking inside vehicles and deciding who was to get stopped.
[00:39:06.327 --> 00:39:12.332]  Now in Police State 2000, we have the video of I-35 shut down for 15, 20 miles, an hour and a half to get through it.
[00:39:12.752 --> 00:39:14.154]  Cars going one mile an hour.
[00:39:14.454 --> 00:39:15.074]  Cars everywhere.
[00:39:15.094 --> 00:39:17.076]  People have been arrested all over the sides of the highway.
[00:39:17.196 --> 00:39:19.859]  Giant spotlights beaming it in your face.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.921]  This was during the day, though, was it not?
[00:39:23.041 --> 00:39:23.662]  Yes, it was.
[00:39:23.822 --> 00:39:24.823]  Okay, please continue.
[00:39:24.943 --> 00:39:38.895]  This is 11 o'clock in the morning, and they had several sheriff's deputies posted on approach roads for at least five miles past the checkpoint that was scrutinizing and looking
[00:39:41.885 --> 00:39:51.851]  Now they have these all over the country, they claim they're a seatbelt check, but did you hear me mention that the federal funding of this, billions of billions a year, is to federalize police and train them, there is no fourth amendment?
[00:39:53.906 --> 00:39:59.553]  What occurred this previous Saturday during the Memorial Day weekend occurred at the same location.
[00:39:59.873 --> 00:40:09.103]  Now describe from the witnesses and the people, because I've been getting calls from people who were eyewitnesses but are afraid to come on, what happened at the National Guard Armory this time?
[00:40:09.324 --> 00:40:13.048]  Yes, most of the people who are afraid to come on, they're getting Social Security checks,
[00:40:13.807 --> 00:40:19.089]  They're getting retirement checks and they do not want to jeopardize their livelihood.
[00:40:19.229 --> 00:40:20.470]  So this is our free country.
[00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:22.891]  You go through an army checkpoint, you're afraid to talk about it.
[00:40:23.151 --> 00:40:24.672]  That's the freedom of America.
[00:40:24.712 --> 00:40:25.152]  Go ahead.
[00:40:25.212 --> 00:40:25.772]  Yes it is.
[00:40:26.972 --> 00:40:32.535]  This was occurring on all traffic going 331 North, Saturday morning, 11 o'clock in the morning.
[00:40:33.375 --> 00:40:35.736]  My neighbors were coming south out of Montgomery.
[00:40:36.443 --> 00:41:06.035]  uh... at that time they were not stopping any beach traffic coming south because quite honestly they could not there were thousands of cars going to the beach uh... on three thirty one south so they were stopping the sparse traffic going north and they were pulling everyone into the national guard armory parking lot which is quite large uh... and they had state troopers they had national guard they had local sheriff deputies and city police and uh... they were all looking in the cars searching some vehicles
[00:41:06.559 --> 00:41:15.266]  And checking driver's licenses and checking driver's licenses of individuals, I am told, who were not even driving automobiles, but were just passengers.
[00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:29.217]  Oh, but the average person, it's about seatbelts, now the EAS FEMA alert system has nothing to do with Amber Alert, is now flashing, report illegal guns, report terrorists, uh, click it or ticket.
[00:41:29.237 --> 00:41:31.478]  This is, this is the new America.
[00:41:32.419 --> 00:41:34.581]  Uh, what was going on with helicopters this time?
[00:41:35.436 --> 00:41:45.765]  They did have a helicopter circling overhead and that seems to be normal for all the checkpoints.
[00:41:45.905 --> 00:41:49.949]  You saw the heavy machine gun hanging out the window two years ago.
[00:41:50.029 --> 00:41:50.730]  That is correct.
[00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:57.856]  The neighbors who were driving down did not see the machine guns hanging out the windows, but they did see the helicopter.
[00:42:01.437 --> 00:42:07.422]  Helicopters are overhead in case they have a vehicle that decides to turn around and not go through the checkpoint.
[00:42:08.163 --> 00:42:10.545]  So I guess the Army's gonna then shoot at you.
[00:42:10.565 --> 00:42:12.006]  I mean, what's the point of the M60?
[00:42:12.606 --> 00:42:22.534]  Well, you know, that's what I thought two years ago when I saw the black helicopter with absolutely no markings on it whatsoever and an M60 machine gun hanging out the window, is what if somebody decided not to stop?
[00:42:23.555 --> 00:42:25.357]  Were they going to shoot you off the highway?
[00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:29.921]  And I know that this is going on because I
[00:42:30.931 --> 00:42:33.293]  I do the health segment on radio several times a month.
[00:42:33.413 --> 00:42:40.779]  Many people call me very concerned on a regular basis with checkpoints like you described going on all over the country.
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:53.890]  We're seeing facilities, and I don't know if you are aware of the huge facilities that are being built along I-10 in Alabama on into Florida and then I-75 south to Orlando.
[00:42:54.979 --> 00:42:58.862]  These are facilities that have at least 15, 20 acres.
[00:42:59.883 --> 00:43:05.726]  Newsmax reported that one, three, one million man camps are being built.
[00:43:05.766 --> 00:43:07.087]  They have a federal purchase order.
[00:43:07.708 --> 00:43:20.777]  These are facilities that would first resemble a weigh station that is on, that they have a little off ramp going off where the 18 wheelers get weighed and then get right back on the interstate.
[00:43:20.817 --> 00:43:22.818]  However, these facilities have
[00:43:24.682 --> 00:43:35.449]  A half a mile of concrete scattered around on the facility, several buildings, towers, radio telecommunications, satellite and everything, one on either side of the interstate.
[00:43:36.049 --> 00:43:40.752]  Those are just pick-up centers, and they've got helicopters that fly undesirables to FEMA camps.
[00:43:40.852 --> 00:43:50.978]  Well, you know, they have the facility there that can hold at least a couple thousand cars at any one time at those facilities, and they're being built all along
[00:43:51.642 --> 00:43:52.803]  Uh, the Florida Turnpike.
[00:43:52.823 --> 00:43:56.625]  Did anybody ask them, uh, what does this have to do with click it or ticket?
[00:43:58.326 --> 00:44:06.131]  You know, it's the company, the country's supposedly strapped for money and, um, the states, uh, are crying that they don't have any tax dollars and yet we see
[00:44:06.761 --> 00:44:10.364]  Billions of dollars being spent on these facilities that are going up.
[00:44:10.544 --> 00:44:12.866]  Sorry, it's the National Seat Belt Initiative.
[00:44:12.946 --> 00:44:14.388]  It's $4 billion a year.
[00:44:14.448 --> 00:44:15.969]  It started out at $2.4 billion.
[00:44:16.389 --> 00:44:22.575]  I have the federal plans and it says internal check points that will be funded by tolls.
[00:44:25.817 --> 00:44:32.023]  Which means they'll start placing tolls on federal interstates to support their... They already have in Kansas and Missouri and other areas.
[00:44:33.211 --> 00:44:36.643]  Sir, let me read you an article out, because people think this is about stopping terrorists.
[00:44:37.124 --> 00:44:39.472]  This is out of the Tribune Review, Pittsburgh Tribune Review.
[00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:41.851]  Greensburg police stop immigrants.
[00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:46.473]  A wrong turn on a truck of illegal immigrants into a seat belt awareness checkpoint in Greensburg on Monday.
[00:44:46.833 --> 00:44:49.075]  But after an hour-long detainment, police let them go.
[00:44:49.095 --> 00:44:59.700]  A police officer handing out ticket flyers to drivers on North Main Street near Cabin Hill Drive noticed two men, later determined to be Mexicans, sitting in the front seat of a truck, were not wearing seat belts.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.981]  They were told to pull over.
[00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:05.743]  A search of the truck found five other Mexican men lying side-by-side in the back, concealed by hidden windows.
[00:45:05.783 --> 00:45:07.904]  Two women were riding behind the front seats.
[00:45:07.924 --> 00:45:08.845]  None of them spoke English.
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.543]  Turned out that all of them but one were illegals.
[00:45:12.663 --> 00:45:13.564]  It was a coyote.
[00:45:14.325 --> 00:45:23.455]  The police chief called and the feds, the new US Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration that got rid of the IRS, said it wasn't interested in getting involved and ordered them to release them.
[00:45:24.597 --> 00:45:34.841]  The police chief says that 1,262 vehicles were searched, hundreds were arrested and fined and feed, but only citizens, illegals were ordered to be released by the feds.
[00:45:35.561 --> 00:45:37.121]  So, isn't that nice?
[00:45:37.442 --> 00:45:38.182]  Isn't that nice?
[00:45:38.522 --> 00:45:43.744]  Had nothing to do with seatbelts, they were searching vehicles, but if you're a felon, you go through.
[00:45:43.764 --> 00:45:52.667]  Well, look at the NAFTA agreement where the broken down tractor-trailer rigs can come across the border from Mexico and run all the way to Canada.
[00:45:53.314 --> 00:45:59.379]  And I'm told... By the way, they're turning over and exploding and smashing every day on I-35 in Texas.
[00:45:59.699 --> 00:46:01.520]  It's like a death trap driving down it.
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:07.465]  Coming back from Kansas, we saw a Mexican truck overturned, smashed into 50 pieces with another 18-wheeler.
[00:46:08.285 --> 00:46:11.668]  You see them driving with their tires, the rubber flying off of them.
[00:46:11.708 --> 00:46:16.951]  Well sure, I'm told... And the brand new American rigs are pulled over being harassed by military police.
[00:46:17.432 --> 00:46:18.593]  I'm told that the Mexican
[00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:22.638]  Truck drivers cannot be fined under NAFTA.
[00:46:22.658 --> 00:46:23.478]  They cannot be, no.
[00:46:23.798 --> 00:46:27.239]  And they can run their products from Mexico all the way to Canada.
[00:46:27.259 --> 00:46:35.442]  You know, I manufacture nutritional products and I am having a very difficult time even getting my products into Canada right now.
[00:46:36.622 --> 00:46:40.584]  Canadian Customs are holding my products as long as 45-50 days.
[00:46:40.604 --> 00:46:43.305]  Same thing with my videos.
[00:46:43.885 --> 00:46:47.906]  Just holding them and we're having a difficult time getting products to the doctors.
[00:46:48.789 --> 00:46:49.569]  Anything else?
[00:46:49.669 --> 00:46:50.650]  What else happened?
[00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:56.132]  Any other key areas of stuff that developed during these loving military Nazi checkpoints?
[00:46:56.912 --> 00:47:13.458]  The people who are calling me tell me that they have witnessed the same scenarios in rural areas of Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and I'm sure that as time goes on I'll be getting more phone calls.
[00:47:14.236 --> 00:47:23.385]  And these people are very, most of the people that call me are in their 70s, very concerned about their health and welfare with these checkpoints.
[00:47:24.166 --> 00:47:30.613]  And it is a concern and I tell each and every person, carry some survival gear in your car.
[00:47:30.693 --> 00:47:31.934]  Don't just have it in your house.
[00:47:32.414 --> 00:47:34.957]  Carry water, carry some survival gear in case you get
[00:47:35.875 --> 00:47:39.257]  In one of these situations where you're stuck there for several hours a day.
[00:47:39.277 --> 00:47:44.981]  They have said that if there is one attack, they're going to shut down all the cities, lock everything down.
[00:47:45.341 --> 00:47:48.664]  Folks, when they go to Red Alert, you'll have only a few hours to get out of your city.
[00:47:49.464 --> 00:47:50.225]  And they're going to lock it.
[00:47:50.245 --> 00:47:51.405]  This is martial law, folks.
[00:47:51.726 --> 00:47:54.247]  This is military dictatorship coup d'etat.
[00:47:55.028 --> 00:47:56.308]  We have the federal plan.
[00:47:56.629 --> 00:47:57.990]  Does this disgust you, Bill?
[00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:58.870]  Yes, it does.
[00:48:00.231 --> 00:48:01.492]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[00:48:02.242 --> 00:48:06.505]  I would like to add that I'm sure you've told your listeners a thousand times.
[00:48:08.987 --> 00:48:11.588]  Please stop procrastinating and start preparing.
[00:48:12.269 --> 00:48:13.209]  It's never too late.
[00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:16.352]  You're never going to get finished because I've been preparing for 10 years.
[00:48:16.792 --> 00:48:18.233]  I certainly never will be finished.
[00:48:18.953 --> 00:48:22.516]  But you've got to have a starting point and you've got to start getting things together.
[00:48:22.856 --> 00:48:26.458]  All right, Bill McFallon, a witness of this multiple years.
[00:48:26.578 --> 00:48:27.459]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:48:27.499 --> 00:48:28.360]  Take care, my friend.
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.000]  Thank you.
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:30.221]  I'll be back with a bunch of news.
[00:48:32.455 --> 00:48:39.841]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:48:40.101 --> 00:48:44.865]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:48:45.065 --> 00:48:50.730]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:55.474]  Witness in horror, the execution of the September 11th attacks, and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:48:55.754 --> 00:49:02.860]  Attached was society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:07.244]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:49:07.584 --> 00:49:10.086]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:49:10.307 --> 00:49:17.072]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our Constitutional Republic.
[00:49:17.273 --> 00:49:22.517]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[00:49:31.912 --> 00:49:42.642]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:49:42.822 --> 00:49:50.430]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:53.793]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:49:54.073 --> 00:49:59.839]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:50:00.099 --> 00:50:06.245]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:50:06.625 --> 00:50:10.509]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:12.431]  The water level is always visible.
[00:50:12.631 --> 00:50:18.556]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:50:18.796 --> 00:50:22.760]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:50:48.553 --> 00:50:49.154]  I think so.
[00:51:08.996 --> 00:51:09.376]  That's right.
[00:51:31.477 --> 00:51:35.203]  Yes, I'm hysterical, folks.
[00:51:35.263 --> 00:51:38.989]  I saw the federal plans to put hardened checkpoints with goons
[00:51:47.083 --> 00:51:50.746]  It's said they're going to have the new Citizen AmeriCorps at the checkpoint.
[00:51:50.786 --> 00:51:57.832]  You heard callers yesterday and I do have the news reports of volunteers out helping search the cars, getting us all involved.
[00:51:57.912 --> 00:52:01.395]  Cameras are going up on all the roads, everywhere, rural areas.
[00:52:03.276 --> 00:52:07.680]  And the border stays wide open and the feds order, Homeland Security orders, illegals released.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.462]  They are untouchable.
[00:52:10.703 --> 00:52:12.784]  And what is the ACL doing?
[00:52:13.165 --> 00:52:13.765]  ACLU.
[00:52:13.785 --> 00:52:15.687]  They're saying, I've got the report here from the AP,
[00:52:16.474 --> 00:52:17.535]  We're very angry.
[00:52:17.575 --> 00:52:18.876]  They're stopping illegals.
[00:52:18.916 --> 00:52:20.937]  They're targeting illegals.
[00:52:21.017 --> 00:52:23.939]  These checkpoints are racist and need to be targeted on everyone.
[00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:27.281]  It's being done to everyone but the illegals.
[00:52:28.482 --> 00:52:29.623]  This is incredible!
[00:52:31.604 --> 00:52:37.689]  And I just read the Tribune Review article about the out of Pittsburgh and I've got dozens of other reports I've seen the last week on this subject.
[00:52:37.749 --> 00:52:39.530]  I mean, it's just out of control.
[00:52:40.928 --> 00:52:43.390]  And then I read this article, students will scan for meals.
[00:52:43.650 --> 00:53:03.966]  The school board woman said, I do not believe that any parent or student has ever had the expectation in order to go through a lunch line or to buy a cookie or carton of milk that they or their children would have to be first fingerprinted, said Heming Bob, who says she will probably refuse to have her three children in the Akron schools fingerprinted.
[00:53:04.006 --> 00:53:07.129]  But now they're saying they may not allow packed lunches.
[00:53:07.805 --> 00:53:11.767]  For safety, and they may inspect their food to make sure.
[00:53:11.887 --> 00:53:14.568]  CPS will be involved if it's not nutritious.
[00:53:15.208 --> 00:53:18.469]  Same schools that put all the junk food vending machines in.
[00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:24.572]  The state-of-the-art futuristic technology is only being used in one other Ohio school district, Garfield Heights.
[00:53:25.859 --> 00:53:30.860]  The system will replace the mail ticket method that has been used in Akron Middle School and cafeterias for nearly two decades.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.201]  It will not be used, at least initially, in elementary schools.
[00:53:34.301 --> 00:53:41.643]  Students' fingerprints will be put into a scanner that will make a template of binary numbers corresponding with the unique swirls and arcs of each print.
[00:53:42.383 --> 00:53:47.704]  And then it says here, that I think we're in the 21st century, said board member Linda Kersker.
[00:53:48.641 --> 00:53:50.403]  We need to move forward, not backward.
[00:53:50.424 --> 00:53:54.409]  And then they say that the cash register and cash is outmoded.
[00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:57.773]  And with one touch, this will bring convenience and security.
[00:53:58.334 --> 00:53:59.315]  No-ho-ho-ho!
[00:53:59.335 --> 00:54:03.100]  I mean, come on, man!
[00:54:03.941 --> 00:54:23.897]  Imagine, 20 years ago, making some 1984 movie, or Brave New World movie, you know, a THX 1138 type film, where the kids, imagine a future movie, imagine if they'd have made America with a K, with Christopher Stopperson, and where the communists take over, and imagine the movie, the kids having to thumb scan to get food, you'd have been, oh, that'll never happen, imagine that nightmare future!
[00:54:24.658 --> 00:54:31.043]  And now, there are dozens of school districts that we know of in Texas that are doing it, it's happening in England to get library books, to get food,
[00:54:32.741 --> 00:54:34.423]  Oh, man!
[00:54:35.564 --> 00:54:37.806]  I mean, come on!
[00:54:38.686 --> 00:54:45.432]  And simultaneously it's going in the driver's license facilities, the banks, the grocery stores people, from Kansas to New York to Texas.
[00:54:46.653 --> 00:54:47.414]  Come on!
[00:54:47.974 --> 00:54:49.175]  You want to fight these people?
[00:54:49.195 --> 00:54:50.777]  Get my videos.
[00:54:50.877 --> 00:54:51.998]  Make hundreds of copies.

[00:56:13.395 --> 00:56:20.300]  Ask God for guidance on this issue and realize that from Colorado to Texas in major cities are trying to make it the law to thumb scan to buy and sell.
[00:56:21.664 --> 00:56:22.104]  Gold.
[00:56:22.444 --> 00:56:23.745]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:56:23.985 --> 00:56:25.606]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.
[00:56:25.866 --> 00:56:27.907]  From the Industrial Age to the Space Age.
[00:56:28.187 --> 00:56:31.849]  Gold has weathered the test of time for 6,000 years.
[00:56:36.471 --> 00:56:39.653]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.253 --> 00:56:47.893]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.574 --> 00:56:49.614]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.335 --> 00:56:51.475]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.115 --> 00:56:52.916]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:54.597]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.057 --> 00:56:59.199]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.419 --> 00:57:03.541]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:06.663 --> 00:57:11.685]  Did you ever think you'd open up the newswire on Reuters and read U.S.
[00:57:11.825 --> 00:57:13.126]  announces death camps?
[00:57:14.184 --> 00:57:29.582]  Did you ever think you'd get reports from all 50 states of military checkpoints pulling people over into National Guard armories, searching old people's cars as lumbering 18-wheeler Mexican trucks with the tires flying off of them roll down the road at 75 miles an hour?
[00:57:31.564 --> 00:57:34.566]  Do you ever think you'd hear announcements of hover drones to watch our cities?
[00:57:35.046 --> 00:57:39.128]  That you'd hear they'd sign deals with Canadian and Mexican troops to quote deal with American terrorists?
[00:57:39.688 --> 00:57:42.490]  Or that national news would say every child needs a microchip?
[00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:44.611]  Do you ever think you'd hear about forced inoculations?
[00:57:44.831 --> 00:57:47.512]  Do you ever think you'd hear about red alerts where you can't leave your house?
[00:57:47.532 --> 00:57:51.714]  Do you ever think you'd see FEMA saying Christians and gun owners are terrorists?
[00:57:51.774 --> 00:57:52.755]  Well, it's fact.
[00:57:53.684 --> 00:57:57.567]  It's here, ladies and gentlemen, for sterilization, total degradation.
[00:57:57.787 --> 00:58:05.472]  They plan to herd you into the dehumanization chambers through the threat of terrorism that they, the globalists, are bringing you.
[00:58:07.013 --> 00:58:08.133]  We have economist Michael Hagee.
[00:58:08.153 --> 00:58:09.254]  He was unable to join us yesterday.
[00:58:09.294 --> 00:58:10.235]  I had it wrong in my book.
[00:58:10.275 --> 00:58:12.496]  It was today, coming on in about 29 minutes.
[00:58:13.216 --> 00:58:16.919]  We got calls, we got news, we got it all today.
[00:58:19.187 --> 00:58:21.968]  I just love this country so much.
[00:58:22.188 --> 00:58:25.409]  I can't believe how fast things are moving and how bad they are.
[00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:28.390]  But there is a massive awakening taking place.
[00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:31.330]  The toll-free number to join me on air will take a lot of calls in the next 30 minutes.
[00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:31.971]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:32.031 --> 00:58:33.651]  Is this having the same effect on you?
[00:58:34.091 --> 00:58:37.472]  Do you have a desire to defend freedom against this evil?
[00:58:41.974 --> 00:58:44.575]  You have a burning desire to fight this slave grid.
[00:58:44.595 --> 00:58:45.375]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:48.176]  Grant in Minnesota.
[00:58:48.656 --> 00:58:52.217]  Grant, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:58:52.717 --> 00:59:01.639]  Speaking of out of control, I was recently just surrounded by the military on an unsigned search warrant looking for bombs and explosives.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:07.861]  I'm raising... I was lured away from the court by activists on false charges.
[00:59:07.921 --> 00:59:11.282]  And while I was there, I have Siberian tigers on my property.
[00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:14.652]  While I was there, the military surrounded the place.
[00:59:15.713 --> 00:59:22.559]  As they were confiscating my tiger cub, the military were high-fiving each other and laughing.
[00:59:25.969 --> 00:59:27.190]  Was this in the newspaper?
[00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.730]  No.
[00:59:27.991 --> 00:59:29.171]  We need to call the newspaper.
[00:59:29.191 --> 00:59:30.352]  That's very newsworthy.
[00:59:30.692 --> 00:59:34.875]  So they decided you couldn't have these Siberian tigers.
[00:59:34.895 --> 00:59:41.059]  They've been stealing people's wildlife on a lot of ranches and farms, even here in Texas.
[00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:44.221]  What type of army showed up to steal your goods?
[00:59:44.442 --> 00:59:46.723]  It looked like the bomb squads in the military.
[00:59:46.823 --> 00:59:49.165]  They had green with ski masks.
[00:59:49.425 --> 00:59:50.946]  A lot of them had sniper rifles.
[00:59:51.932 --> 00:59:53.993]  I'd say there were at least 30 of them.
[00:59:54.233 --> 00:59:57.535]  And they showed up with fish and wildlife or BLM?
[00:59:58.916 --> 00:59:59.517]  I'm not sure.
[00:59:59.797 --> 01:00:01.678]  I'm supposed to be protected by U.S.
[01:00:01.738 --> 01:00:04.079]  Code Title 28 Endangered Species Act.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.601]  So what exactly happened to you, sir?
[01:00:06.641 --> 01:00:09.062]  Describe what developed.
[01:00:09.363 --> 01:00:17.808]  Activists were... All they have to do is say somebody got scratched and they'll come in and all somebody has to do is lie to the police.
[01:00:18.728 --> 01:00:19.889]  And this girl lied in court
[01:00:20.461 --> 01:00:21.682]  Five times on the stand.
[01:00:21.842 --> 01:00:26.025]  So it was a endangered species grabber went and lied in court?
[01:00:26.285 --> 01:00:26.545]  Yes.
[01:00:27.946 --> 01:00:29.627]  I know, I've seen those stories in the press.
[01:00:29.707 --> 01:00:30.488]  And so what happened?
[01:00:30.528 --> 01:00:31.949]  The troops hit you and hit you hard?
[01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:36.231]  Took my guns, found no explosives, confiscated the tiger.
[01:00:36.251 --> 01:00:39.473]  Now a judge has just ordered it to be put to death.
[01:00:40.534 --> 01:00:42.095]  And I can send you a copy of that.
[01:00:42.716 --> 01:00:43.536]  Yeah, send that to me.
[01:00:43.576 --> 01:00:44.317]  I'll have you as a guest.
[01:00:44.337 --> 01:00:45.577]  You should send that to the local news.
[01:00:45.918 --> 01:00:47.759]  What did this happen in Loving, Minnesota?
[01:00:47.959 --> 01:00:49.300]  Seven miles south of Red Wing.
[01:00:50.595 --> 01:00:53.237]  Minnesota, about an hour south of the Twin Cities.
[01:00:53.537 --> 01:00:55.479]  And it's going on on a nationwide scale.
[01:00:55.539 --> 01:00:55.979]  No, I know.
[01:00:56.039 --> 01:00:57.220]  I've seen them all over the place.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.223]  People that have lions and tigers and have them on their property and, you know, big 20-foot fences.
[01:01:01.664 --> 01:01:04.085]  They just show up and say, you can't have these at Machine Gun Point.
[01:01:04.145 --> 01:01:05.166]  No warrants, no nothing.
[01:01:05.667 --> 01:01:06.167]  Exactly.
[01:01:07.168 --> 01:01:13.212]  On a nationwide scale through fake, false fraud, zoning, and public nuisance charges.
[01:01:14.273 --> 01:01:15.414]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:01:15.474 --> 01:01:16.535]  So they were high-fiving.
[01:01:16.875 --> 01:01:19.297]  And my dad was a police officer for 30 years.
[01:01:19.337 --> 01:01:20.218]  Oh, they could care less.
[01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.645]  I want to hear about this when we get back.
[01:01:24.385 --> 01:01:25.426]  Roving teams.
[01:01:25.446 --> 01:01:27.367]  You heard yesterday about them raiding the widow.
[01:01:28.487 --> 01:01:31.328]  Sculling cross-bone license plates on their vehicles in Georgia.
[01:01:31.348 --> 01:01:32.969]  This is the new America.
[01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:35.370]  Army checkpoints.
[01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:36.871]  Helicopters.
[01:01:37.051 --> 01:01:37.751]  Drones.
[01:01:37.951 --> 01:01:39.732]  Giant FEMA camps.
[01:01:40.192 --> 01:01:40.752]  Go team!
[01:01:43.774 --> 01:01:46.875]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:01:47.135 --> 01:01:48.976]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio
[01:01:52.261 --> 01:01:52.501]  I think.
[01:01:56.189 --> 01:01:59.551]  Dual conversion improves shortwave image for better shortwave reception.
[01:02:00.052 --> 01:02:03.634]  Single sideband allows for reception of upper and lower sideband signals.
[01:02:03.894 --> 01:02:13.261]  Other features include 45 station memory, auto preset system, auto memory scan, tone controls, dual time display, and adjustable sleep timers.
[01:02:13.661 --> 01:02:21.306]  Included accessories, the ANT60 portable shortwave antenna, AC adapter, stereo earbuds, and a soft-sided carrying case.
[01:02:21.827 --> 01:02:25.209]  Also, a one-year full factory warranty on parts and labor.
[01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:26.551]  All this for only $139.
[01:02:26.591 --> 01:02:26.932]  Call today 877-605-9200.
[01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:27.132]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:02:27.152 --> 01:02:27.433]  Call today.
[01:02:42.896 --> 01:02:49.702]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:02:50.042 --> 01:02:51.404]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:02:51.604 --> 01:02:53.806]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:02:53.966 --> 01:02:56.048]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:02:56.328 --> 01:03:01.252]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:05.636]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:03:05.876 --> 01:03:07.657]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:03:07.737 --> 01:03:18.385]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:03:18.525 --> 01:03:20.426]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:03:20.646 --> 01:03:24.509]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.
[01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:26.170]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:27.811]  Or order online
[01:03:33.735 --> 01:03:43.680]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.242]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:03:46.402 --> 01:03:47.102]  It feels great.
[01:03:47.262 --> 01:03:48.323]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:03:48.383 --> 01:03:53.726]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:03:53.986 --> 01:03:55.727]  I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:03:55.907 --> 01:03:59.029]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:03:59.149 --> 01:03:59.789]  Incredible.
[01:03:59.989 --> 01:04:01.191]  I'm really excited naturally.
[01:04:01.231 --> 01:04:04.876]  I have a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:04:05.156 --> 01:04:08.621]  Sharon lost 28 pounds with collagen aid from Vim and Vigor.
[01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:15.391]  I have arthritis and I have a thyroid problem and blood pressure and Vim and Vigor has really been a blessing to me.
[01:04:15.691 --> 01:04:16.052]  I've lost
[01:04:16.732 --> 01:04:18.033]  28 pounds and counting.
[01:04:18.433 --> 01:04:21.295]  And I thank them very much from the bottom of my heart.
[01:04:21.675 --> 01:04:26.298]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:04:26.638 --> 01:04:27.698]  Call right now 1-800-622-FIN.
[01:04:27.838 --> 01:04:28.539]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:29.459]  $25 off a three-month supply.
[01:04:29.479 --> 01:04:30.700]  So call Vim and Vigor today 1-800-622-FIN.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.340]  Again that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:04:43.803 --> 01:04:49.406]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:52.587 --> 01:04:57.229]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 central and back from 9 to midnight, I'm here live.
[01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:10.235]  Folks, I have to tell you, every indicator of a police state, every indicator of a tyranny, of a despotism is now upon us and
[01:05:11.215 --> 01:05:20.380]  I mean, I know people personally out in the country, no criminal record, veterans, old people, SWAT teams raid them, point guns at them, search around, tear stuff up, walk out of their house.
[01:05:22.561 --> 01:05:23.721]  It's a sick joke!
[01:05:24.042 --> 01:05:29.524]  And then we talk about this in the news, all these checkpoints and pulling people off the road in the National Guard armories.
[01:05:30.785 --> 01:05:32.666]  Our whole society is just imploding.
[01:05:33.386 --> 01:05:38.489]  And then I hear about people who have exotic game or exotic animals on their ranches or farms.
[01:05:39.187 --> 01:05:47.150]  And the environmental groups show up with the police, SWAT teams shove you around, take your wildlife, which you're legally and lawfully allowed to have.
[01:05:48.471 --> 01:05:52.092]  Just everybody's being harassed and that's what Grant Minnesota was telling us about.
[01:05:52.172 --> 01:05:58.115]  The Army showed up with a SWAT team and took his Siberian tigers and they said put them to death.
[01:05:58.175 --> 01:05:59.115]  The judge ordered that.
[01:06:00.116 --> 01:06:01.916]  And so this is the new America.
[01:06:01.956 --> 01:06:04.017]  He said the troops were giving each other high fives.
[01:06:04.577 --> 01:06:06.798]  What did you say to these guys when this happened to you?
[01:06:09.079 --> 01:06:10.700]  They just screwed over the wrong guy.
[01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:16.342]  Well, I'm... Look, I mean, why were they high-fiving each other?
[01:06:16.362 --> 01:06:22.385]  Because I've seen it when they shove an old woman down into a fire ant bed, tell her to sit there in it as the ants crawl over.
[01:06:22.685 --> 01:06:26.006]  They'll then do high-fives and, like, do weird monkey behavior.
[01:06:26.687 --> 01:06:30.228]  They're not out fighting foreign troops, they're just shoving people around.
[01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:32.109]  It's horrible thugism.
[01:06:32.749 --> 01:06:34.930]  So what exactly... What'd they do?
[01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:36.111]  How long were they at your farm?
[01:06:36.638 --> 01:06:39.629]  Well, they were here for four hours, and when I got back from court...
[01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:41.699]  I couldn't get near my driveway.
[01:06:41.719 --> 01:06:43.360]  They had about 40 vehicles in the way.
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.761]  So, let me get this straight.
[01:06:44.841 --> 01:06:46.462]  You went to court because of a complaint?
[01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:47.123]  On false charges.
[01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:55.328]  Okay, I understand, but you were at court, you know, going through the judicial process, and then hold on, and then while you were gone, they raided you?
[01:06:55.608 --> 01:06:56.069]  Exactly.
[01:06:56.169 --> 01:06:57.289]  They had the place surrounded.
[01:06:57.690 --> 01:07:09.678]  By the way, in California, when you go turn in your SKS, which they run TV ads saying turn them in, almost everybody gets held at gunpoint at the police station, then they tear your house apart for bringing in the gun they said turn in.
[01:07:11.129 --> 01:07:12.610]  So this is all part of the new America.
[01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:13.290]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:07:13.871 --> 01:07:22.476]  And all the investigators were laughing as they left, and I had a brand new Satellite 800 Grundig, and it doesn't work no more after they left.
[01:07:23.036 --> 01:07:26.458]  They also destroyed one of my surveillance systems.
[01:07:26.478 --> 01:07:27.319]  It no longer works.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:39.826]  And as they were torturing the tiger on a ten-foot pole with a wire around its neck as they were duct-taping it, the militaries were high-fiving each other and laughing.
[01:07:40.646 --> 01:07:44.028]  And a zoo would have taken that Siberian tiger and what, paid you 50 grand?
[01:07:44.508 --> 01:07:52.732]  They're going extinct in Siberia and now they're trying to... No, no, just the San Antonio Zoo and it said that it's a very rare type of cat.
[01:07:54.493 --> 01:07:56.974]  And I believe the same thing happened in the 30s and 40s.
[01:07:57.274 --> 01:08:00.576]  They had it down to 25 tigers in the wild.
[01:08:02.677 --> 01:08:04.538]  And so you've got this out at your farm.
[01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:07.671]  They show up, and they were high-fiving.
[01:08:07.711 --> 01:08:08.772]  What did you say to them?
[01:08:08.792 --> 01:08:09.812]  Did you say, this is wrong?
[01:08:09.892 --> 01:08:11.993]  I said, what's going on?
[01:08:12.053 --> 01:08:13.834]  Why do you have so many people here?
[01:08:13.854 --> 01:08:15.135]  Are you sure you've got enough guys here?
[01:08:16.615 --> 01:08:19.757]  And my dad was an investigator in Minneapolis for 30 years.
[01:08:19.857 --> 01:08:22.058]  He was in the military for 46 years.
[01:08:23.199 --> 01:08:26.400]  He fought in Iwo Jima, in Korea, and they have me surrounded.
[01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:32.403]  So I've watched the police go from totally helping the community in the 60s and 70s to
[01:08:34.878 --> 01:08:37.859]  Thirty years later, it's totally backwards and they're attacking everyone.
[01:08:37.999 --> 01:08:51.342]  Well, sir, now you say that, and we're going to go to Ann in Louisiana and John and Bill and others, but tell me, now, you say they confiscated your guns.
[01:08:51.362 --> 01:08:52.902]  What did they say that was for?
[01:08:53.802 --> 01:08:54.202]  They didn't.
[01:08:54.883 --> 01:08:56.703]  Well, earlier you said they took your guns.
[01:08:57.163 --> 01:08:58.863]  They took my guns and all my paperwork.
[01:09:00.084 --> 01:09:00.924]  But you said they didn't.
[01:09:00.944 --> 01:09:01.424]  What does that mean?
[01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:02.764]  They did?
[01:09:02.784 --> 01:09:04.886]  You're saying they did, so what happened?
[01:09:05.646 --> 01:09:11.290]  So they, they uh, so I'm uh, I'm in the process of getting all the charges dropped.
[01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:14.532]  No, no, there's been no uh, nobody's committed a crime.
[01:09:15.732 --> 01:09:17.073]  Have you gotten your guns back?
[01:09:17.574 --> 01:09:18.194]  No, not yet.
[01:09:18.734 --> 01:09:19.975]  How many guns did they take?
[01:09:20.235 --> 01:09:20.555]  Three.
[01:09:21.796 --> 01:09:22.777]  Did they have a warrant?
[01:09:23.277 --> 01:09:24.518]  Uh, unsigned warrant.
[01:09:24.955 --> 01:09:26.477]  Oh yeah, just a blank sheet of paper, you know.
[01:09:26.577 --> 01:09:29.380]  But all that was for was bombs and explosives and paperwork.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:29.881]  No guns?
[01:09:29.961 --> 01:09:30.842]  Bombs and explosives.
[01:09:30.862 --> 01:09:32.243]  They were investigating a terrorist.
[01:09:32.604 --> 01:09:33.044]  Exactly.
[01:09:33.084 --> 01:09:43.556]  By the way, now when you hear about any type of case, anything, it's called terrorism and the Deputy Attorney General Mike Van Winkle in California said that protesting is now going to be terrorist.
[01:09:43.636 --> 01:09:44.077]  I have the
[01:09:45.225 --> 01:09:46.466]  I have the Oakland Tribune here.
[01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:48.667]  He says because that aids terrorists to protest the war.
[01:09:49.168 --> 01:09:50.469]  So this is the new America.
[01:09:50.489 --> 01:09:52.190]  Well, sir, get me some documentation.
[01:09:52.650 --> 01:09:53.831]  Hold the newspapers.
[01:09:53.891 --> 01:09:54.551]  Tell them about it.
[01:09:54.611 --> 01:09:56.112]  Somebody will write a story in your area.
[01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.794]  Do I mail that to where I order your videotapes?
[01:09:59.054 --> 01:10:06.199]  Yeah, just write it to Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:10:06.439 --> 01:10:08.981]  I'll mail the copy of the judge's decision.
[01:10:09.261 --> 01:10:11.523]  Yeah, you need to call all the newspapers and tell them about this.
[01:10:12.119 --> 01:10:13.940]  They've been attacking us in the media.
[01:10:14.301 --> 01:10:14.821]  All negative.
[01:10:14.861 --> 01:10:16.362]  They won't help.
[01:10:16.542 --> 01:10:18.424]  Will you send me the articles please?
[01:10:18.844 --> 01:10:19.124]  Yes.
[01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:20.905]  What did the media say?
[01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:23.427]  That you were an evil terrorist?
[01:10:23.547 --> 01:10:25.048]  They can't answer one of my questions.
[01:10:25.529 --> 01:10:30.092]  My sister has mailed them two sheets full of questions and they can't answer one.
[01:10:30.552 --> 01:10:33.535]  But they say in the newspaper articles I won't answer their calls.
[01:10:34.735 --> 01:10:36.116]  Oh yeah, that's a favored tactic.
[01:10:36.176 --> 01:10:36.777]  Thank you for the call.
[01:10:37.503 --> 01:10:38.284]  Send me the articles.
[01:10:38.664 --> 01:10:39.464]  Very important, sir.
[01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:40.605]  And your information.
[01:10:40.625 --> 01:10:42.446]  We'll have you on as a guest, and we'll give the phone numbers out.
[01:10:42.766 --> 01:10:44.507]  Find out who the thugs were that came to your house.
[01:10:45.128 --> 01:10:54.333]  It's like every day now, we get these calls, whether it's a widow or some guy on a farm or Eugene, Oregon, where the schoolteacher comes out and says, can I go to school?
[01:10:54.473 --> 01:10:55.394]  You know, they have the street block.
[01:10:55.794 --> 01:10:57.275]  I didn't kill anybody in two weeks.
[01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:58.816]  That's what they said to her.
[01:10:59.536 --> 01:11:03.179]  Let's talk to John, or no, Ron in New York, and then Bill and others.
[01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:04.739]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:11:04.759 --> 01:11:05.440]  Hi, Alex.
[01:11:05.993 --> 01:11:11.117]  Alex, this thing with the Akron School District is the most in-your-face outrage.
[01:11:11.397 --> 01:11:13.979]  Oh, they make the kids thumb scan, no cash allowed, yeah.
[01:11:14.119 --> 01:11:14.579]  That's right.
[01:11:14.599 --> 01:11:15.480]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:17.181]  And you know what gets to me, really?
[01:11:17.221 --> 01:11:18.021]  I gotta say that.
[01:11:18.181 --> 01:11:23.465]  I am more disgusted at the type of response that's being reported by parents.
[01:11:24.065 --> 01:11:27.087]  They say things like, well, I'll give them a bagged lunch.
[01:11:27.668 --> 01:11:30.350]  That's not an appropriate response to this type of thing.
[01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:33.352]  What they should be doing is organizing to raise hell
[01:11:33.979 --> 01:11:36.981]  Get those school board members removed from their positions.
[01:11:37.641 --> 01:11:38.242]  Protest.
[01:11:38.642 --> 01:11:43.565]  Well, the school spent $700,000 on it.
[01:11:43.725 --> 01:11:45.987]  It is admitted total information awareness.
[01:11:46.327 --> 01:11:54.192]  I've got a Pentagon article where they say they quote, want to know what you eat, how you sleep, what you watch, what you look at, what you do.
[01:11:54.372 --> 01:11:54.972]  This is it.
[01:11:55.072 --> 01:11:57.394]  Your children thumb scanning to get food.
[01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:59.371]  That raises great suspicion.
[01:11:59.451 --> 01:12:04.456]  Why would a school district want to spend that amount of money to implement what's really an unnecessary system like this?
[01:12:04.476 --> 01:12:06.138]  Let me tell you about some of the school districts in Texas.
[01:12:06.178 --> 01:12:08.460]  They have fences with a bar facing in.
[01:12:09.601 --> 01:12:13.044]  The children wear ID cards with their social security number in a barcode.
[01:12:13.505 --> 01:12:15.627]  They are searched on a weekly basis.
[01:12:15.647 --> 01:12:19.871]  There are police with black combat boots marching up and down the halls.
[01:12:21.064 --> 01:12:24.525]  They have been caught right here in Texas molesting the children.
[01:12:25.045 --> 01:12:31.607]  There are CPS people, they do monthly interviews with all the children, asking about mommy and daddy so they can set CPS on them.
[01:12:32.007 --> 01:12:41.209]  We are already in a Soviet system, but the news doesn't report on it, and so the average person doesn't know, or it happens to them, and they think, oh, it's just me.
[01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:48.711]  Well, any community, and in the case of Akron, it is being reported, the community that's under siege like that, the parents in that area,
[01:12:49.201 --> 01:12:51.422]  It's time now for them to act like men and women.
[01:12:51.862 --> 01:12:53.562]  Get together and organize and fight this.
[01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:58.944]  Because the damn fact of the matter is that there is no reason for this other than something nefarious.
[01:12:59.044 --> 01:13:04.345]  There's something completely nefarious about wanting to fingerprint a kid so he can get some cookies and some milk.
[01:13:04.565 --> 01:13:07.566]  No cash allowed!
[01:13:07.886 --> 01:13:08.266]  That's right.
[01:13:08.306 --> 01:13:09.387]  They want to eliminate that.
[01:13:09.487 --> 01:13:11.407]  And then you have the school board.
[01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:12.548]  Petty little tyrants.
[01:13:12.948 --> 01:13:13.668]  The school board.
[01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:16.143]  So this is a federal plan.
[01:13:16.543 --> 01:13:24.505]  They're putting them in banks, grocery stores, the DPS, Department of Public Safety.
[01:13:25.105 --> 01:13:31.486]  Yeah, safety in your state, really federalized, is getting the template, the face scan, the thumb scan for the system.
[01:13:31.526 --> 01:13:32.406]  It's happening, sir!
[01:13:32.686 --> 01:13:33.847]  It's happening right now!
[01:13:34.087 --> 01:13:40.688]  I know that it is, and I'm pretty certain that they're using all these little indirect methods with very, very poor excuses as cover stories.
[01:13:42.021 --> 01:13:45.463]  I'm pretty certain I have the Pentagon Plan in 1968.
[01:13:47.304 --> 01:13:54.369]  Well, it's being implemented here because there's no justification for taking down the fingerprints of a child in order to get some lunch.
[01:13:54.429 --> 01:14:05.196]  And when that school board member made a statement to the effect that we've got to go forward into the future, who the heck is that member to determine what the people in Akron, Ohio have to do with their children
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.682]  To go forward into an Orwellian future.
[01:14:07.702 --> 01:14:13.206]  Sir, they are now fining and arresting parents in Germany and England if they refused to open their mouths to the dentist.
[01:14:13.847 --> 01:14:17.209]  They are doing so in Ohio, in Pennsylvania.
[01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:20.072]  They take five-year-olds and do genital checks.
[01:14:20.772 --> 01:14:23.835]  They caught a lesbo ring doing it in one area.
[01:14:23.875 --> 01:14:24.895]  You all heard about that.
[01:14:25.556 --> 01:14:29.179]  I know that the schools have been turned into sort of penitentiaries.
[01:14:29.359 --> 01:14:30.620]  And this has been going on for a while.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:34.103]  I saw reports, and this was on mainstream TV remarkably,
[01:14:34.543 --> 01:14:37.284]  Of a school somewhere in Georgia where they have kids lined up.
[01:14:37.364 --> 01:14:43.125]  I mean, they look more like victims in a concentration camp and they have the police go up and down with a dog and sniff them.
[01:14:43.425 --> 01:14:47.066]  Could you imagine having a young mind having to be educated in that kind of environment?
[01:14:47.086 --> 01:14:48.207]  They're training them for checkpoints.
[01:14:48.247 --> 01:14:49.207]  They're training them to thumbstand.
[01:14:49.227 --> 01:14:50.247]  They're breaking their will.
[01:14:50.287 --> 01:14:51.427]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:14:51.467 --> 01:14:53.908]  They're breaking their will to have any self-respect.
[01:14:54.528 --> 01:14:56.989]  And now they're trying to shut down the homeschools.
[01:14:57.754 --> 01:14:58.675]  Yeah, that's another thing.
[01:14:58.715 --> 01:14:59.055]  That's right.
[01:14:59.075 --> 01:15:01.816]  In California, they're going after homeschooling with a vengeance.
[01:15:02.196 --> 01:15:03.457]  Oh, they're just saying it's illegal.
[01:15:03.497 --> 01:15:04.397]  Haven't even passed a law.
[01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:05.958]  They just say, you can't do it.
[01:15:06.418 --> 01:15:16.083]  Sir, sir, they're now... I have a clip of the newscast in Police State 3 Total Enslavement where they announce on CBS, in Travis County, you are now guilty until proven innocent.
[01:15:16.423 --> 01:15:18.244]  And it says you must leave jail.
[01:15:18.284 --> 01:15:20.646]  You must sign a form agreeing that you are a criminal.
[01:15:21.226 --> 01:15:27.109]  And in the newscast, they admit people that get arrested for not having a seat belt, which they now do to everybody here,
[01:15:28.186 --> 01:15:39.177]  They say, in the newscast, you must sign a form that you are a drug dealer, family violence, a criminal, and many people then sign the form and have their kids seized the next day for being taken in for parking tickets!
[01:15:39.517 --> 01:15:41.499]  It's in the newscast!
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.324]  And while Mike Hanson, my cameraman, four years ago, he went to jail for refusing a search,
[01:15:47.142 --> 01:16:16.413]  of his car and they portrayed him and said sign it and began doing the pressure points under his neck and then when he got the surveillance camera tape five minutes was missing by the way this is in the uh... houston chronicle today remember when they used homeland security to go out to the legislators when they left yeah that the democratic legislators yeah it turns out that the dps fema command center the tape the five minutes with audio and video uh... where the speaker was in there giving orders that five minutes malfunctioned
[01:16:17.395 --> 01:16:19.095]  It just happened to be that five minutes.
[01:16:19.296 --> 01:16:19.956]  Of course!
[01:16:19.996 --> 01:16:21.316]  How more obvious can they make it?
[01:16:21.356 --> 01:16:30.119]  Look, on the video of Mike getting tortured, you see him walking up around him, Mike... How more stupid can we be that it hasn't reached the point now that... Sign the document!
[01:16:30.179 --> 01:16:31.179]  It's America!
[01:16:31.299 --> 01:16:32.619]  We're gonna choke you!
[01:16:32.739 --> 01:16:33.680]  It's freedom!
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.660]  Sign it that you're a criminal!
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.341]  Red, white, and blue!
[01:16:37.581 --> 01:16:39.641]  We wear black ski masks!
[01:16:39.921 --> 01:16:41.742]  Oh, it's so good!
[01:16:44.221 --> 01:16:48.723]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:16:49.064 --> 01:16:53.166]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:53.446 --> 01:16:54.006]  We listened.
[01:16:54.306 --> 01:16:59.289]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:59.569 --> 01:17:00.049]  We listened.
[01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:03.471]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.891 --> 01:17:04.432]  We listened.
[01:17:04.892 --> 01:17:08.814]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:17:08.834 --> 01:17:09.475]  We're good.
[01:17:34.799 --> 01:17:35.782]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:17:35.802 --> 01:17:37.425]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:17:42.609 --> 01:17:45.971]  Pharmaceutical companies, doctors, and hospitals all make money from sick people.
[01:17:46.212 --> 01:17:48.233]  So what incentive is there for them to make you well?
[01:17:48.573 --> 01:17:54.197]  For thousands of years, man has used spices and herbs to ward off disease and cure, yes cure, illness.
[01:17:54.457 --> 01:17:57.660]  It's no wonder the drug manufacturers feel threatened by spices and herbs.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.843]  The North American Herb and Spice Company manufactures the products that Dr. Cass Ingram has been recommending for years.
[01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:06.726]  The oregosin, oreganol, and oregamax are working wonders for people all over the country.
[01:18:06.966 --> 01:18:08.347]  And can work wonders for you, too.
[01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:15.511]  According to the Quarterly Review of Biology published by the University of Chicago, spices like oregano can have a 100% kill rate of bacteria.

[01:18:41.925 --> 01:18:46.828]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a roadmap, and how easy it would be to get lost?
[01:18:47.128 --> 01:18:48.488]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[01:18:48.528 --> 01:18:50.869]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:54.131]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[01:18:54.171 --> 01:18:54.551]  coins.

[01:20:43.118 --> 01:20:48.702]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:51.724 --> 01:21:18.500]  One of my friends, an army veteran, no criminal record, a contractor, has a little successful contracting company, pull him over to checkpoint, demand to search his car, he says no, they pull him out, beat him up, and he was torn up pretty bad, big guy, didn't even resist them, and then we went to court, and they put through all this trouble, subpoenaed the videotape, and right when it shows them dragging him out of the car, the videotape cuts for two minutes.
[01:21:20.279 --> 01:21:23.700]  Now, when Mike got tortured, we got the surveillance camera tape.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:36.444]  It's Mike standing there, being booked in, and they walk over with a piece of paper, and then suddenly you see Mike calmly talking, and then all of a sudden you see four or five more jail guards walk up and the tape goes bleep for about five minutes.
[01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:47.268]  And then I got this article here, I'm trying to dig it out of the stack, posted it on InfoWars.com, and it says here in the article that, oh,
[01:21:48.295 --> 01:21:48.796]  Uh, here it is.
[01:21:48.816 --> 01:21:50.717]  This is, uh, this is Houston Chronicle.
[01:21:51.217 --> 01:21:53.900]  Malfunction blame for gap on DPS tape.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:22:06.669]  The Texas State Police officials on Monday blamed a faulty duplication machine for a five-hour, five-hour, excuse me, gap in the Capitol security tape that was given to a House Commerce investigating how authorities handled the Democratic walkout.
[01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:16.157]  Now, it's been confirmed that they called out Homeland Security and federalized the matter, uh, and they were using the signs, flashing, look for the Democrats, you know, about terrorism, see?
[01:22:16.741 --> 01:22:18.002]  I thought it was for missing kids.
[01:22:40.673 --> 01:22:52.398]  A bunch of the leaders of the House were running around in the command center, the FEMA command center, joint DPS center, the controls, the takeover, radio and TV stations and billboards and everything.
[01:22:52.458 --> 01:22:53.898]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:22:53.958 --> 01:22:59.900]  So, it's, see, cameras, yeah, they could be a good thing, but no, because evil people run them.
[01:23:00.781 --> 01:23:04.762]  DNA testing, oh yeah, it's 100%, but they get caught running frauds all the time, see?
[01:23:05.983 --> 01:23:07.383]  Let's talk to Bill in Alaska.
[01:23:07.423 --> 01:23:08.284]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:23:08.344 --> 01:23:08.884]  Welcome, sir.
[01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:10.290]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:10.371 --> 01:23:11.311]  Alex, how are you today?
[01:23:11.692 --> 01:23:15.235]  I am just... This stuff is just out of control.
[01:23:15.976 --> 01:23:16.657]  I understand.
[01:23:18.018 --> 01:23:21.942]  I'd like to try to encapsulate this for these folks that might be listening.
[01:23:24.664 --> 01:23:33.132]  You know, a fascist government, their whole motivation is power for profit and profit for power.
[01:23:35.572 --> 01:23:39.875]  If people look up the definition of fascism, they'll find out we have a fascist government.
[01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:48.079]  And the only way that these people can compete against the world economy based on slave labor is to enslave us.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.941]  Is to make us slaves, that's it.
[01:23:50.361 --> 01:23:59.806]  And now the biggest part of our economy is prisons, and people getting twenty-something cents an hour in those prisons taking your jobs, people, and you go, good, make them prisoners work, okay?
[01:23:59.826 --> 01:24:02.168]  Well, that's the way it's working up here in Alaska.
[01:24:04.734 --> 01:24:10.105]  If they have a contract going and need some heavy equipment operators.
[01:24:10.962 --> 01:24:17.943]  Rather than paying them scale, they'll find out who's behind in their child support or something like that and get them to work for five dollars a day instead of union scale.
[01:24:18.043 --> 01:24:18.524]  That's it.
[01:24:18.584 --> 01:24:21.224]  The people mopping the floors at the jails and the city buildings?
[01:24:21.584 --> 01:24:22.144]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:22.324 --> 01:24:38.768]  Or people on a... See, then when they get... Look, you get arrested for no seatbelt, not having your insurance on you, parking tickets now, they take you, they say sign it, you get into these classes that cost over a thousand dollars, and then they say, okay, you also have to go do community service.
[01:24:38.808 --> 01:24:39.208]  That's it?
[01:24:39.628 --> 01:24:39.948]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:41.344 --> 01:24:53.215]  You know, Alex, what I see here is that, if you remember right, it was just a handful of Assyrians that came down there and took the Jews into Babylonian captivity.
[01:24:54.236 --> 01:24:57.519]  And I prayed about it and asked God, I said, what's the deal here?
[01:24:57.819 --> 01:25:01.583]  There were enough people to rise up and throw this yoke off.
[01:25:03.737 --> 01:25:05.698]  God showed me that they had no righteousness.
[01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:06.598]  That's it!
[01:25:06.678 --> 01:25:13.161]  You can't have righteous indignation about what's going on if you have no righteous foundations to push from.
[01:25:15.262 --> 01:25:18.723]  And that's pretty much all I wanted to say, but it's the American people's fault.
[01:25:19.504 --> 01:25:24.846]  The repercussions for their sin is built right into the
[01:25:25.808 --> 01:25:29.591]  Yeah, I don't think we can have 50 million abortions and God isn't going to punish us.
[01:25:29.771 --> 01:25:30.292]  You're right, brother.
[01:25:30.312 --> 01:25:31.493]  I just beg God for forgiveness.
[01:25:31.873 --> 01:25:32.353]  I'll let you.
[01:25:32.633 --> 01:25:33.334]  Let's go, Alex.
[01:25:33.354 --> 01:25:33.874]  Thank you, sir.
[01:25:34.455 --> 01:25:35.316]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:25:35.416 --> 01:25:36.537]  Absolutely on target.
[01:25:36.957 --> 01:25:38.418]  Larry, Louisiana, you're on the air.
[01:25:38.458 --> 01:25:38.878]  Go ahead.
[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:41.681]  Go ahead.
[01:25:42.001 --> 01:25:42.161]  Hi.
[01:25:43.122 --> 01:25:43.602]  Hi, Alex.
[01:25:43.642 --> 01:25:48.666]  I was listening to the news out of Baton Rouge last night, and it was a lead story and a trailing story I'm going to go over real quick.
[01:25:49.206 --> 01:25:50.327]  You've heard the lead story.
[01:25:50.347 --> 01:25:54.771]  It was a female soldier was found guilty for not following orders at Fort Drum
[01:25:55.456 --> 01:26:02.341]  New York, she refused to take the anthrax shot, citing later in life health reasons, found guilty.
[01:26:02.381 --> 01:26:06.184]  So now, get this, she's going to Leavenworth and or dishonorable discharge.
[01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:09.407]  Trailing story, a company called Gentek
[01:26:09.978 --> 01:26:20.247]  Has just stopped, gone up 37% today because the Food and Drug Administration has authorized human trials of the anthrax shot.
[01:26:20.847 --> 01:26:24.630]  Oh yeah, the feds say they're going to forcibly inject us with dozens of vaccines.
[01:26:24.730 --> 01:26:29.654]  So those GIs are less than human, they're not even as good as any pig, just give them a shot.
[01:26:30.295 --> 01:26:31.096]  Absolutely!
[01:26:33.077 --> 01:26:35.960]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.949 --> 01:26:39.730]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.051 --> 01:26:46.092]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:26:46.392 --> 01:26:51.334]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking a hot shower than when you drink the water?
[01:26:51.574 --> 01:26:54.175]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they are free.
[01:26:54.195 --> 01:26:54.235]  888-803-4438.
[01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:55.336]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:26:55.356 --> 01:26:55.596]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:27:20.677 --> 01:27:21.578]  I love America.
[01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:24.579]  America's about freedom and liberty and that's all disappearing.
[01:27:25.299 --> 01:27:27.380]  They're on the news saying torture's good.
[01:27:28.421 --> 01:27:31.062]  They're on the news saying a police state is good.
[01:27:31.742 --> 01:27:37.225]  They're on the news and then is it any surprise police will torture you for a traffic citation once they get you to the jail?
[01:27:38.525 --> 01:27:42.207]  Is it any surprise they've got military running checkpoints now around the country?
[01:27:42.227 --> 01:27:47.269]  Is it any surprise kids are being searched every week at school and having a thumb scan to get food?
[01:27:48.624 --> 01:27:52.567]  The new economy, the number one part of the economy, according to Forbes, is prisons now.
[01:27:53.088 --> 01:27:55.270]  And prison labor that competes against you.
[01:27:57.672 --> 01:28:00.294]  And conservatives haven't thought this out, folks.
[01:28:00.434 --> 01:28:02.215]  They say, oh good, make them prisoners work.
[01:28:02.255 --> 01:28:03.937]  They're taking your jobs, people.
[01:28:06.999 --> 01:28:09.341]  This is the new America, getting you into the system.
[01:28:10.602 --> 01:28:11.863]  They just say, here, plea bargain.
[01:28:11.883 --> 01:28:12.904]  They don't even tell you it's a plea bargain.
[01:28:12.924 --> 01:28:13.725]  They say, sign here.
[01:28:14.452 --> 01:28:15.253]  Wave your rights!
[01:28:15.273 --> 01:28:15.833]  It's happening.
[01:28:15.853 --> 01:28:18.615]  We're about to go to Michael Hagan, an economist, and get into more of the calls.
[01:28:19.616 --> 01:28:21.497]  I got a bunch of other news I haven't even covered yet.
[01:28:21.517 --> 01:28:26.580]  I want to remind the listeners that I produced nine full-length feature documentary films.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:29.683]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement, is now out.
[01:28:29.883 --> 01:28:31.204]  It is an incredible film.
[01:28:31.604 --> 01:28:33.085]  Two hours and 37 minutes.
[01:28:33.185 --> 01:28:36.747]  I suggest you watch it in three 50-minute blocks.
[01:28:38.569 --> 01:28:41.791]  I suggest you see the film, that you make copies of it.
[01:28:42.899 --> 01:28:44.741]  You get it out to everyone in your area.
[01:28:44.761 --> 01:28:47.744]  I also have 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror.
[01:28:48.084 --> 01:28:50.547]  Those two films about September 11th and the takeover there.
[01:28:50.567 --> 01:28:54.231]  I have my book, Descent into Tyranny, $12.
[01:28:55.252 --> 01:28:56.093]  They're all excellent.
[01:28:56.113 --> 01:28:56.954]  The films are $25.95.
[01:28:57.574 --> 01:28:58.775]  Order three or more, they drop down to $20.
[01:28:58.916 --> 01:29:01.799]  I mean, take Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:29:02.219 --> 01:29:04.942]  Patriot Act 1 and 2 detailed in stunning detail.
[01:29:06.336 --> 01:29:15.124]  Homeland Security, Total Information Awareness Network, dozens of other confirmed examples of government-sponsored terrorism, but the government carries out terror to scare you into submission.
[01:29:16.865 --> 01:29:17.946]  The film goes on and on.
[01:29:17.966 --> 01:29:19.728]  There's no way to really describe everything that's in it.
[01:29:19.768 --> 01:29:23.091]  You need to get Police State 3, Total Enslavement, if you were impressed with the other films.
[01:29:23.471 --> 01:29:25.713]  If you haven't gotten any of the films, get The Road to Tyranny,
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.721]  The Masters of Terror and Police State 3 total enslavement.
[01:29:31.141 --> 01:29:34.501]  Get them, make copies, get them out to everyone now, folks.
[01:29:35.081 --> 01:29:37.822]  The total free number to order the films is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:29:37.862 --> 01:29:38.902]  That's 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or Net.
[01:29:52.950 --> 01:30:02.398]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:30:04.019 --> 01:30:10.664]  Again, that's 888-253-3139, or infowars.com or the mailing address.
[01:30:10.945 --> 01:30:12.186]  You want to do something about this?
[01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:13.907]  You've got to wake people up to the plan.
[01:30:14.327 --> 01:30:18.831]  Not just where they see pieces of what's happening, they need to see the whole thing to understand it.
[01:30:20.151 --> 01:30:30.959]  You better stand up and speak out in your area and stand up against this federalization, the multi-jurisdictional task forces, the checkpoints, the FEMA takeover of the media, for the Amber Alert, all of it.
[01:30:30.999 --> 01:30:31.919]  You better do it now.
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:37.323]  Michael Haga is a best-selling author, economist, worked for some of the big Fortune 500 companies.
[01:30:38.704 --> 01:30:39.685]  And he joins us now.
[01:30:39.725 --> 01:30:41.406]  We appreciate him coming back on the show.
[01:30:41.446 --> 01:30:42.867]  We've seen a plunging in the dollar.
[01:30:42.887 --> 01:30:45.929]  They're obviously manipulating markets, having it go up and down.
[01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:48.591]  The Treasury bad-mouthing the dollar on purpose.
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:57.222]  We have durable good orders down, sales down, shutdown of factories across the board by design.
[01:30:57.342 --> 01:30:59.123]  Michael Hager, why?
[01:30:59.143 --> 01:31:02.944]  You've done some incredible forecasting five years ago, what's now happening.
[01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:04.925]  What is the New World Order?
[01:31:05.125 --> 01:31:06.025]  What is their model?
[01:31:06.385 --> 01:31:07.606]  And what is their plan?
[01:31:07.646 --> 01:31:08.866]  How are we going to stop them, Michael?
[01:31:10.246 --> 01:31:13.908]  Boy, that's a mouthful.
[01:31:15.188 --> 01:31:18.469]  Alex, the New World Order is all about power.
[01:31:20.137 --> 01:31:31.085]  And you know, when I first started doing radio and writing books, my background has always been the traditional American way.
[01:31:31.105 --> 01:31:38.831]  I mean, I went, I was prosecutor for a while, went to Baylor University Law School, working on my MBA at the same time.
[01:31:38.851 --> 01:31:43.975]  You know, when I graduated from law school, I thought I was going to do great things.
[01:31:44.936 --> 01:31:48.779]  And you were talking, before we get into the economic side of this,
[01:31:49.970 --> 01:32:15.750]  about prisons and factories and things when I began as a prosecutor fresh out of law school what you're saying is true in our federal system specifically every prison I shouldn't say every prison but almost all minimum or even the maximum security prisons across the country on the federal side
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:20.462]  Have these commercial factories attached to them.
[01:32:20.683 --> 01:32:23.544]  And private profits by people in the current administration.
[01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:30.208]  Yeah, the inmates, they're now called, gosh, what is it?
[01:32:30.829 --> 01:32:33.570]  Not guests, anyway, they're not inmates anymore.
[01:32:35.922 --> 01:32:43.365]  They work in these factories, and they can be anything from companies making clothing to signs.
[01:32:43.385 --> 01:32:46.466]  It used to be license plates, but many, many products.
[01:32:46.946 --> 01:32:50.167]  And the residents, that's what they are now, not inmates.
[01:32:50.247 --> 01:32:55.309]  The residents are paid up to, I believe it's 20 cents an hour.
[01:32:57.350 --> 01:33:05.654]  And that money goes into their commissary fund and they can use their hourly wages to buy things from the commissary.
[01:33:06.014 --> 01:33:08.475]  So they make 20 cents an hour to produce products.
[01:33:09.102 --> 01:33:13.223]  that are then, and we're paying, we're subsidizing to keep these people in prison.
[01:33:13.243 --> 01:33:19.485]  And then just like sharecropping, the same private company that has the contract of the prison sells them the Doritos for $2.
[01:33:20.105 --> 01:33:29.567]  Yeah, but then the products that the prisoners make, that the residents make, are sold in the open market for less
[01:33:30.479 --> 01:33:35.823]  The same type of products can be anything, jeans, anything that you see on consumer shelves.
[01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:43.649]  A lot of stores like Walmart and different things, they buy these products because they can buy them cheaply and sell them and make a good profit.
[01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:51.234]  So, the industry makes a good, you know, it's a money maker for, I should say, the federal government.
[01:33:52.277 --> 01:33:58.280]  They're subsidized by the federal government, but a lot of them are private industry companies.
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:00.342]  So they're sweetheart deals.
[01:34:00.722 --> 01:34:03.503]  But how does a real private company compete with that?
[01:34:03.523 --> 01:34:04.144]  They can't do it.
[01:34:04.884 --> 01:34:07.245]  And so they all dive into the private prison market.
[01:34:07.565 --> 01:34:07.806]  Yeah.
[01:34:08.366 --> 01:34:12.708]  So the fastest growing industry in America today is the prison industry.
[01:34:13.469 --> 01:34:13.809]  Scary.
[01:34:13.989 --> 01:34:16.530]  Well, Forbes says it's now the biggest as of two years ago.
[01:34:16.710 --> 01:34:17.111]  Yeah, it is.
[01:34:17.131 --> 01:34:18.591]  Well, it's fastest growing.
[01:34:18.671 --> 01:34:19.112]  And it is.
[01:34:19.212 --> 01:34:19.952]  It's a huge.
[01:34:20.512 --> 01:34:21.493]  And it is an industry.
[01:34:22.256 --> 01:34:25.458]  We don't lock up big-time drug dealers.
[01:34:25.498 --> 01:34:27.639]  We lock up small-time drug users.
[01:34:27.859 --> 01:34:29.580]  Well, I've seen the statistics.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:35.162]  They'll release a murderer after four and a half years for some little pothead who was caught with an ounce of marijuana.
[01:34:35.482 --> 01:34:37.523]  He gets five years and works the whole time.
[01:34:37.703 --> 01:34:37.964]  Sure.
[01:34:38.304 --> 01:34:42.606]  I mean, we don't go after the big fish in America.
[01:34:42.666 --> 01:34:43.926]  We go after the little fish.
[01:34:44.267 --> 01:34:47.988]  And especially the big fish that have money and political connections.
[01:34:48.008 --> 01:34:49.089]  They can do anything they want.
[01:34:49.429 --> 01:34:51.250]  We have become a land of lawlessness.
[01:34:51.846 --> 01:34:53.307]  We're the little guys that are locked up.
[01:34:53.347 --> 01:34:54.948]  The predators go after weak people.
[01:34:55.208 --> 01:34:58.289]  If you're a talk show host, battling them, they leave you alone.
[01:34:58.449 --> 01:35:01.471]  They go after ignorant people that don't know their rights, Michael.
[01:35:01.651 --> 01:35:02.291]  Yeah, they do.
[01:35:02.552 --> 01:35:02.852]  They do.
[01:35:03.192 --> 01:35:03.872]  And it's scary.
[01:35:03.952 --> 01:35:05.313]  And our rights are disappearing.
[01:35:05.993 --> 01:35:11.556]  And I am honestly... When I first started all this, Alex, I thought people like you were crazy.
[01:35:13.817 --> 01:35:14.718]  But you're not.
[01:35:15.518 --> 01:35:17.379]  And people like me need to wake up.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.861]  Because the country, our rights are disappearing.
[01:35:22.507 --> 01:35:34.331]  We are being slowly taken over through the financial sector, which really controls Congress, the White House, everything.
[01:35:34.491 --> 01:35:37.011]  Everything is based on economics.
[01:35:37.591 --> 01:35:40.832]  And that is the key to this, quote, New World Order.
[01:35:41.713 --> 01:35:43.273]  And in the New World Order,
[01:35:44.048 --> 01:35:48.450]  These prison systems could become a way of life for each and every one of us.
[01:35:49.131 --> 01:35:50.752]  And theoretically, they already are.
[01:35:50.812 --> 01:35:52.452]  Look, most people are deeply in debt.
[01:35:53.353 --> 01:35:54.474]  They don't own their homes.
[01:35:54.954 --> 01:35:56.515]  They pay a mortgage to a bank.
[01:35:56.795 --> 01:36:00.617]  So they're basically renting, but they think they have a vested interest.
[01:36:02.758 --> 01:36:04.139]  They don't own their cars.
[01:36:04.239 --> 01:36:06.820]  They're making payments to another lending company.
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:12.283]  You know, they don't even own their land because the state can come and seize it if you don't pay your taxes.
[01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:16.576]  So really, we don't own anything in America anymore.
[01:36:17.096 --> 01:36:21.199]  We are working for the, what, the country store?
[01:36:21.859 --> 01:36:27.342]  Like in the old days, you worked for a mining company, you went to the... I owe my soul to the company store!
[01:36:27.422 --> 01:36:38.268]  Yeah, and we're paying taxes that we really legally don't have to pay, but if you don't pay them, they'll come after you, if you have anything to come after.
[01:36:40.336 --> 01:36:42.898]  Your rights, as you said, have been eroded.
[01:36:43.919 --> 01:36:45.480]  We have become a police state.
[01:36:46.241 --> 01:36:50.704]  And it all comes right back down to the financial structure.
[01:36:51.785 --> 01:36:54.427]  And the financial structure is the Federal Reserve.
[01:36:55.068 --> 01:36:58.531]  And the Federal Reserve is part of the international banking community.
[01:36:59.331 --> 01:37:02.694]  And the most powerful man in America is Alan Greenspan.
[01:37:03.515 --> 01:37:04.816]  He controls the President.
[01:37:05.636 --> 01:37:09.940]  He controls our lives daily, hourly,
[01:37:11.578 --> 01:37:16.843]  The Fed has a license to steal.
[01:37:16.963 --> 01:37:20.265]  Well, it's the Viceroy for the big central banks of the world, as you've said.
[01:37:20.966 --> 01:37:30.253]  We also need to add here that they've designed a financial system where you cannot pay the debts, but there is a vortex created that is designed to totally consolidate.
[01:37:30.293 --> 01:37:32.074]  They don't care about our standard of life, do they?
[01:37:32.375 --> 01:37:33.155]  No.
[01:37:33.776 --> 01:37:39.200]  Look, we talk about people like Saddam Hussein, who we put in power, by the way.
[01:37:41.079 --> 01:37:43.020]  Uh... raping the country.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:45.141]  Well, go to Washington.
[01:37:45.521 --> 01:37:47.662]  Our leaders are raping the country.
[01:37:48.083 --> 01:37:55.346]  They are living like, you know, princes and kings and the rest of us have become indentured servants.
[01:37:55.366 --> 01:38:00.369]  And they give themselves immunity from the very things they put on us.
[01:38:00.649 --> 01:38:00.989]  Oh yeah.
[01:38:01.649 --> 01:38:06.912]  And if people understood, legally, Washington D.C.
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:13.424]  should have no power outside of Washington, D.C.
[01:38:14.044 --> 01:38:16.966]  That's why we have a separation of powers and states' rights.
[01:38:17.607 --> 01:38:34.859]  But through this little-known thing called the Interstate Commerce Clause, the federal government owns the one-inch strip of land between each boundary of each state through this thing called the Interstate Commerce Clause.
[01:38:34.899 --> 01:38:36.780]  And they've utilized that clause
[01:38:37.515 --> 01:38:48.239]  To slowly take over everything from transportation, to banking, to, you know, labor laws, to prisons, to everything.
[01:38:49.759 --> 01:38:51.500]  And is it constitutional?
[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:55.301]  Well, there's a huge question of whether that is even constitutional.
[01:38:55.901 --> 01:38:58.402]  But we don't understand history.
[01:38:59.102 --> 01:39:01.123]  We don't understand the Constitution.
[01:39:01.183 --> 01:39:01.863]  We, the people.
[01:39:03.164 --> 01:39:06.285]  And so, our leaders who have
[01:39:07.082 --> 01:39:11.946]  Basically been corrupted through the financial system.
[01:39:14.608 --> 01:39:15.469]  Go along with this.
[01:39:16.130 --> 01:39:26.919]  Hey, if somebody came up to you, Alex, and they said, look, anything you want, you can have if you play the game.
[01:39:26.939 --> 01:39:28.300]  Well, I've already been told that.
[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.022]  Yeah.
[01:39:31.283 --> 01:39:33.605]  Most people will say, OK,
[01:39:34.679 --> 01:39:42.645]  You know, it's like the story of a guy that comes up to a gal and says, you know, would you go to bed with me for a million dollars?
[01:39:42.705 --> 01:39:45.987]  And she thinks a minute and says, yeah.
[01:39:46.588 --> 01:39:48.169]  And then he says, how about a dollar?
[01:39:48.189 --> 01:39:49.670]  And she says, no, what do you think I am?
[01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:51.972]  And he says, we've already decided what you are.
[01:39:52.572 --> 01:39:55.134]  You know, we're just negotiating on the price here.
[01:39:56.235 --> 01:39:58.336]  And that's what our politicians have done.
[01:39:59.757 --> 01:40:03.000]  And I don't fault them because
[01:40:04.002 --> 01:40:09.225]  Power, ultimate power corrupts, and it corrupts absolutely.
[01:40:09.886 --> 01:40:13.448]  Let me read you a story to talk about this, how they're going to net us all in the system.
[01:40:13.748 --> 01:40:14.808]  Okay.
[01:40:15.789 --> 01:40:19.211]  This is New York's Hometown Connection Daily News, New York Daily News.
[01:40:19.311 --> 01:40:20.172]  Ticket for what?
[01:40:20.312 --> 01:40:23.814]  Almost anything, even feeding birds draws a summons.
[01:40:24.394 --> 01:40:31.358]  Ella and Sarage Schultman were ticketed for blocking their driveway, their own driveway.
[01:40:31.498 --> 01:40:32.359]  Alexander Orts,
[01:40:33.448 --> 01:40:59.593]  uh... was ticketed for improperly binding newspapers to be recycled in his front yard uh... this is the black license plate frame that came with your car illegal fifty five dollar fine taking up two seats on a train fifty dollars feeding pigeons in the park fifty dollars used to be that cops wouldn't bother writing a ticket for a minor obscure infractions but with the city hurting for money ordinary citizens suddenly are finding themselves
[01:41:00.456 --> 01:41:05.741]  Shelling out hard-earned cash to pay fines for things they didn't even know were against the law.
[01:41:06.962 --> 01:41:15.530]  And it goes on to say the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association charges the city has a ticket quota and that there's more pressure than ever to cops to write summons.
[01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:16.691]  The city denies the charges.
[01:41:17.512 --> 01:41:18.573]  They claim it's for money.
[01:41:18.633 --> 01:41:22.958]  Well, we know the states actually have their comprehensive annual financial reports, their double set of books.
[01:41:23.398 --> 01:41:25.761]  They have plenty of money for all their checkpoints, the rest of it.
[01:41:26.081 --> 01:41:30.506]  They're claiming, oh, we can't fill the potholes, we're going to lay cops off unless you stop everybody.
[01:41:30.766 --> 01:41:33.229]  We're going to lay school teachers off unless you follow what we say.
[01:41:33.689 --> 01:41:36.632]  It's a pressurization process to get them to follow the orders.
[01:41:37.153 --> 01:41:39.055]  But now, here in Austin, this has been on our news.
[01:41:40.177 --> 01:41:41.638]  Not wearing a seatbelt, arrested.
[01:41:41.658 --> 01:42:03.551]  When you go to the jail, it's been on the news, they say, sign this form, you can't see a lawyer until you do it, 90% of people sign it, and Mr. Hage it says, you agree to all these criminal charges, you agree to classes, you agree to a, uh, to probation, and did you know that in some of the schools now, the public schools, half the kids are on probation for missing a day of class?
[01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:06.433]  I mean, sir, it's already happening, it's worse than you may know.
[01:42:07.387 --> 01:42:07.727]  Oh, no.
[01:42:08.308 --> 01:42:10.049]  I understand everything that's taking place.
[01:42:10.169 --> 01:42:12.510]  Well, not everything, but lots of what's taking place.
[01:42:12.531 --> 01:42:17.834]  You are a prosecutor, but what is that called where you go to jail for not paying five parking tickets?
[01:42:17.894 --> 01:42:18.554]  It's been on the news.
[01:42:19.015 --> 01:42:23.678]  And they say, sign this form saying that you're involved in drugs, family violence, all this stuff.
[01:42:23.898 --> 01:42:28.441]  Then CPS comes to your house, takes your kids, and says, you signed a form saying you did this.
[01:42:28.721 --> 01:42:28.981]  Yeah.
[01:42:29.282 --> 01:42:31.463]  Well, it's called nolo contendere.
[01:42:31.503 --> 01:42:33.224]  In other words, you're saying, I'm not guilty.
[01:42:35.191 --> 01:42:39.394]  You're saying, I don't admit or deny my guilt, but when you sign it, you're really admitting guilt.
[01:42:40.134 --> 01:42:41.075]  People don't understand it.
[01:42:41.175 --> 01:42:42.856]  Yeah, well, it's not even a no contest now.
[01:42:42.896 --> 01:42:44.137]  They've changed that in Austin.
[01:42:44.617 --> 01:42:45.298]  Oh, have they really?
[01:42:45.318 --> 01:42:54.504]  No, it says, I am guilty, but they're deferring prosecution if I take these classes, and it's got all this fine print, and then they sick the social services on you.
[01:42:54.544 --> 01:42:54.784]  Sure.
[01:42:55.144 --> 01:43:01.389]  Take your kids, you know, and then your rights are infringed and people don't realize what it does to them down the road.
[01:43:02.429 --> 01:43:04.911]  It is scary, Alex, and again,
[01:43:05.626 --> 01:43:09.088]  It comes back to the financial structure.
[01:43:10.168 --> 01:43:13.410]  We have been sold out in America.
[01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:16.051]  And it's hard for me to fathom this.
[01:43:16.372 --> 01:43:23.315]  Again, I've always been a traditional American who believed in the system.
[01:43:23.335 --> 01:43:27.117]  And as I began researching it, it's just awesome.
[01:43:27.177 --> 01:43:32.980]  And I've been fortunate in my life to be in positions where I've met people in power.
[01:43:33.746 --> 01:43:45.570]  Including Alan Greenspan and Ben S. Barneke, you know, the Fed, one of the Fed board members here who is an inflation hawk, really.
[01:43:45.630 --> 01:43:46.670]  He loves inflation.
[01:43:46.710 --> 01:43:47.811]  So does Alan Greenspan.
[01:43:48.331 --> 01:43:51.172]  But the bottom line is this.
[01:43:51.872 --> 01:43:59.155]  We, we the people, sold our souls to have creature comforts.
[01:44:00.755 --> 01:44:02.636]  And now we've become very lazy.
[01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:06.932]  And we don't want those comforts to be disturbed.
[01:44:07.832 --> 01:44:09.753]  So we turn a blind eye to everything.
[01:44:09.793 --> 01:44:12.115]  We say, it doesn't matter, it doesn't affect me.
[01:44:13.595 --> 01:44:19.539]  It's kind of like a recession is when your neighbor's unemployed, a depression is when you're unemployed.
[01:44:20.079 --> 01:44:27.463]  Well, more and more people now are being thrown into this depression that has been created by the Fed.
[01:44:28.524 --> 01:44:32.926]  But since the majority are not faced with this situation yet,
[01:44:33.627 --> 01:44:35.568]  They continue to turn a blind eye.
[01:44:35.608 --> 01:44:46.774]  We've had psychological warfare against the American people for so long that they've lost, I think they've lost the ability to even reason.
[01:44:47.955 --> 01:44:51.537]  And so we've become controlled people.
[01:44:52.157 --> 01:44:53.038]  Stay there, Michael Hagan.
[01:44:53.058 --> 01:44:53.778]  It's great to have you on.
[01:44:53.798 --> 01:44:55.219]  I want to talk about the plunging dollar.
[01:44:55.239 --> 01:44:57.080]  I want to get your advice on the economy.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.681]  Talk about some of your best-selling books as well that forecast all this.
[01:44:59.701 --> 01:45:00.862]  It's all coming up.
[01:45:00.942 --> 01:45:01.623]  Infowars.com.
[01:45:05.026 --> 01:45:12.416]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:45:12.696 --> 01:45:17.442]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:45:17.662 --> 01:45:23.310]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:45:23.530 --> 01:45:28.053]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:45:28.273 --> 01:45:35.437]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:45:35.457 --> 01:45:38.879]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[01:45:38.899 --> 01:45:39.079]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:46:05.194 --> 01:46:09.695]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:46:10.035 --> 01:46:14.137]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:46:14.417 --> 01:46:14.977]  We listened.
[01:46:15.277 --> 01:46:20.258]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:46:20.538 --> 01:46:21.019]  We listened.
[01:46:21.419 --> 01:46:24.440]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.400]  We listened.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.041]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:46:29.261 --> 01:46:29.841]  We're good to go.
[01:46:55.776 --> 01:46:57.577]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:46:58.197 --> 01:47:01.658]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[01:48:16.813 --> 01:48:24.035]  During the break, I was talking to Michael Haga, who was a prosecutor, best-selling author, of course, and has worked with some of the major big corporations out there.
[01:48:25.413 --> 01:48:26.913]  Yeah, I saw this from the inside.
[01:48:26.933 --> 01:48:36.575]  I was telling him about how, in Austin now, many of the public schools, half the kids, there's a school with like 1,200 kids we looked at, over 500, had criminal charges against them.
[01:48:36.595 --> 01:48:39.416]  If you're late to class three times, that counts as an unexcused absence.
[01:48:39.776 --> 01:48:41.016]  Criminal charges are filed.
[01:48:41.036 --> 01:48:45.777]  I mean, that's hundreds of thousands of dollars right there over the years in just these schools alone.
[01:48:46.657 --> 01:48:47.738]  We have this happening.
[01:48:48.738 --> 01:48:49.558]  And, uh,
[01:48:50.399 --> 01:48:51.339]  I was talking to you, Michael.
[01:48:51.359 --> 01:48:53.440]  You were saying, oh, that you were familiar with such things.
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:55.441]  And you said you knew things that would scare me to death.
[01:48:55.461 --> 01:48:56.741]  Can you describe those things to me?
[01:48:56.761 --> 01:48:59.282]  Then I want to talk about the dollar and all this other stuff.
[01:49:00.082 --> 01:49:14.026]  Well, just that there are... There is so much corruption, Alex, in the legal system that it has become absolutely unbelievable.
[01:49:14.227 --> 01:49:14.867]  Predatory.
[01:49:15.387 --> 01:49:15.927]  Yeah, it is.
[01:49:16.027 --> 01:49:18.788]  If you have money, you're above the law.
[01:49:19.838 --> 01:49:22.979]  If you don't have any money, you're going to pay.
[01:49:22.999 --> 01:49:26.400]  And the rich can do whatever they want.
[01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:29.040]  You know, look at O.J.
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.441]  Simpson, on and on and on.
[01:49:32.201 --> 01:49:35.742]  The most outlandish things are acceptable.
[01:49:36.622 --> 01:49:46.165]  But if you're a little guy, if you're part of the Joe and Jane or John and Jane six-pack, as the politicians refer to us as, you better watch out.
[01:49:47.265 --> 01:49:52.369]  So, there is no justice in America for the average person.
[01:49:53.369 --> 01:49:57.072]  There is no security in America for the average person.
[01:49:57.552 --> 01:50:03.757]  There will be no retirement plan for the average American working today.
[01:50:03.777 --> 01:50:06.539]  There will be no social security.
[01:50:06.559 --> 01:50:10.421]  99% of all pension plans are unfunded.
[01:50:10.501 --> 01:50:14.944]  And they said they're changing it, quote, on CNN so that you do not own your pension fund.
[01:50:15.225 --> 01:50:15.585]  You don't.
[01:50:16.503 --> 01:50:19.246]  You have no vested interest in Social Security.
[01:50:19.606 --> 01:50:21.307]  They can cancel that tomorrow.
[01:50:22.408 --> 01:50:25.291]  You're expected to pay into it, but there's no contract.
[01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:27.653]  So it could be canceled tomorrow.
[01:50:27.793 --> 01:50:31.457]  They just announced veterans above 65 who are promised lifetime health care aren't getting it.
[01:50:31.717 --> 01:50:32.618]  Are not getting it.
[01:50:32.958 --> 01:50:41.666]  And isn't it interesting that all these things are being announced while the President is asking our troops to continue going into other countries in harm's way
[01:50:42.606 --> 01:50:46.929]  And their spouses left at home are existing on food stamps.
[01:50:47.029 --> 01:50:48.770]  And have CPS grabbing their kids.
[01:50:49.110 --> 01:50:53.853]  Yeah, and they're being exposed to all of these neurological agents.
[01:50:55.694 --> 01:50:57.875]  It is a travesty and a tragedy.
[01:50:58.435 --> 01:51:00.817]  But again, it's been mind warfare.
[01:51:01.497 --> 01:51:04.579]  But I do have a little bit of hope for the future, Alex.
[01:51:05.639 --> 01:51:06.620]  And here's the reason.
[01:51:08.101 --> 01:51:11.703]  The Federal Reserve has been in power in this country
[01:51:12.364 --> 01:51:17.106]  Since inception back in 1913, they changed the banking system.
[01:51:17.646 --> 01:51:24.308]  You have mega wealthy people that control nations that control the world.
[01:51:24.408 --> 01:51:26.189]  It's an interlocking structure.
[01:51:27.569 --> 01:51:31.431]  The American Fed has its counterparts in other countries.
[01:51:32.251 --> 01:51:37.713]  But worldwide right now, you see the Fed, the Fed can only exist through inflation.
[01:51:39.472 --> 01:51:44.334]  And over the years, that's why salaries have gone up and the cost of living has gone up.
[01:51:44.434 --> 01:51:47.975]  Because the Fed creates the illusion of prosperity.
[01:51:48.075 --> 01:51:53.257]  Because eggs and milk stay the same price, but a $15,000 car 8 years ago was $35,000.
[01:51:54.197 --> 01:51:54.417]  Right.
[01:51:55.097 --> 01:51:59.459]  But the people are pacified because every year they're getting a wage increase.
[01:52:00.166 --> 01:52:04.607]  So they don't notice that everything is really outpacing their wage increase.
[01:52:04.627 --> 01:52:06.247]  So what's the good news for you in this hour?
[01:52:06.608 --> 01:52:07.988]  Well, the good news is this.
[01:52:08.348 --> 01:52:11.389]  The Fed is scared to death for the first time since 1913.
[01:52:12.989 --> 01:52:15.550]  Well, actually in the 30s it almost killed them too.
[01:52:15.690 --> 01:52:16.530]  Well, I've said this.
[01:52:16.810 --> 01:52:20.711]  They are pushing so hard right now because they're in trouble.
[01:52:21.071 --> 01:52:25.872]  They are in major trouble worldwide and it is a thing called deflation.
[01:52:27.811 --> 01:52:35.717]  And it means that the Fed can continue to print money and push credit, but who can afford it?
[01:52:37.037 --> 01:52:38.078]  Stay there, Michael Hague.
[01:52:38.098 --> 01:52:39.019]  A second hour coming up.
[01:52:39.039 --> 01:52:39.779]  We'll take calls.
[01:52:39.799 --> 01:52:40.300]  800-259-9231.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:44.482]  Your station doesn't carry the second, third hour.
[01:52:44.783 --> 01:52:45.643]  They really should, folks.
[01:52:45.703 --> 01:52:46.784]  Call them and tell them to please do so.
[01:52:46.804 --> 01:52:49.386]  You want to hear this third hour of Michael Hague, and we'll take your calls.
[01:52:49.446 --> 01:52:50.146]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:52:50.226 --> 01:52:52.508]  Infowars.com is the website.
[01:52:56.144 --> 01:52:59.786]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[01:52:59.926 --> 01:53:04.349]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:53:04.509 --> 01:53:05.469]  The Aeronized Deck.
[01:53:09.411 --> 01:53:12.593]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:20.203 --> 01:53:20.844]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.504 --> 01:53:22.565]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:23.286 --> 01:53:24.406]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.426 --> 01:53:25.868]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.608 --> 01:53:27.489]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.509 --> 01:53:31.832]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:32.353 --> 01:53:36.476]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.757 --> 01:53:43.702]  We're talking to a counselor, if you'd call it attorney in the modern system.
[01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:47.852]  Best-selling author, prosecutor, economist Michael Hager.
[01:53:47.872 --> 01:53:49.113]  He'll be with us for another 30 minutes.
[01:53:49.693 --> 01:53:52.234]  We're going to take calls for him coming up in the next segment.
[01:53:52.254 --> 01:53:56.296]  Toll-free number to join me on this live Thursday edition 1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231.
[01:53:56.316 --> 01:53:58.517]  I got a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet as well.
[01:53:58.537 --> 01:54:00.538]  You'll want to stay with us.
[01:54:07.814 --> 01:54:17.738]  Michael, when I found out how evil the globalists were, when I saw their own policy reports and how they want to sterilize us and dumb us down, they know we're not going to read their policy reports, that is, with a small fraction of the public.
[01:54:18.278 --> 01:54:23.180]  I see them setting up a textbook dictatorship, but I do see a massive awakening taking place.
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:28.241]  And the globalists' own greed, bankrupting all the third world countries, no one can plug into it anymore.
[01:54:28.601 --> 01:54:29.862]  They're creating a collapse.
[01:54:30.624 --> 01:54:32.965]  But you say that actually endangers them.
[01:54:32.985 --> 01:54:38.646]  How does Secretary Snowe bad-mouthing the dollar, how does all this tie in together?
[01:54:38.706 --> 01:54:40.326]  Why are they driving down the dollar right now?
[01:54:40.346 --> 01:54:41.306]  Alright.
[01:54:42.947 --> 01:54:44.727]  The dollar's been high for a long time.
[01:54:45.067 --> 01:54:53.749]  That means that it is harder for people to purchase American-made goods, which there aren't that many anymore, overseas.
[01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:57.610]  But it was good because it made
[01:54:58.323 --> 01:55:02.504]  Investing by foreigners in America, very attractive.
[01:55:02.865 --> 01:55:14.349]  Because then they have dollars, they have dollars and they can buy cheap goods to fill the Walmart shelves, but now they've shut down the factory so we don't have jobs to buy those goods, and now they're even going to kill the dollar so we can't buy those goods.
[01:55:14.869 --> 01:55:18.170]  Well, if they kill the dollar, theoretically,
[01:55:19.678 --> 01:55:28.645]  And you have to remember, Greenspan and company operate in theoretical, it's double speak and it's so bizarre you wouldn't even understand it.
[01:55:28.705 --> 01:55:42.596]  I mean, I've met Alan Greenspan and he's an amazing individual, but by forcing down the value of the dollar, theoretically American-made products become cheaper and so
[01:55:45.661 --> 01:55:48.343]  More money will buy American products.
[01:55:48.403 --> 01:55:52.407]  Yeah, maybe in 10 years if we redevelop industry, but they're going in the opposite direction.
[01:55:52.848 --> 01:55:55.150]  Well, but here's the Achilles heel.
[01:55:57.052 --> 01:55:59.634]  China's currency is tied to the dollar.
[01:56:00.215 --> 01:56:04.659]  And we have our main balance of payment deficit with China.
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:09.504]  So, as the dollar falls, so does the Chinese currency.
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:12.382]  And so it's a no-win situation.
[01:56:12.762 --> 01:56:19.047]  The rest of the world theoretically benefits, and theoretically America will ultimately benefit.
[01:56:19.167 --> 01:56:34.939]  Am I right in saying that a 25% reduction in the value of the dollars, supposedly creating more buying of American products, isn't real because it's still that 25% doesn't compensate for the slave state in China, the no environmental laws, the no workers' compensation.
[01:56:35.099 --> 01:56:35.339]  Right.
[01:56:35.899 --> 01:56:36.760]  It just doesn't work.
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:37.881]  No, it doesn't work.
[01:56:38.693 --> 01:56:44.015]  But they're hoping to force the dollar down in hopes of stimulating short-term the U.S.
[01:56:44.055 --> 01:56:44.416]  economy.
[01:56:44.916 --> 01:56:49.998]  It doesn't make sense, but that's how it works in macroeconomic theory.
[01:56:50.538 --> 01:56:52.019]  So they're forcing it down.
[01:56:52.619 --> 01:57:02.243]  But the reason that these guys are finally scared to death, Alex, is central banks creating credit out of nothing.
[01:57:03.267 --> 01:57:06.409]  And remember, even our dollar is nothing more than a promise to pay.
[01:57:06.449 --> 01:57:07.829]  It's not pegged to anything.
[01:57:07.909 --> 01:57:08.530]  It's totally fiat.
[01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:10.270]  Yeah, it's a fiat currency.
[01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.871]  It's worthless.
[01:57:11.591 --> 01:57:19.354]  It costs the Fed 2.5 cents to print every bill, whether it be a dollar bill or a thousand dollar bill.
[01:57:20.635 --> 01:57:22.236]  So, they're making a killing.
[01:57:23.156 --> 01:57:30.759]  But, the credit, there's very little actual currency.
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:31.840]  Most of it's just credit.
[01:57:33.094 --> 01:57:34.436]  Again, we don't own anything.
[01:57:34.897 --> 01:57:37.301]  We just borrow to buy things.
[01:57:37.722 --> 01:57:42.931]  We pledge tomorrow's labor to get those benefits today.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:55.308]  And it was a good system as long as we had inflation because everything kept going up and you could borrow cheaply today and pay it off with cheaper dollars tomorrow.
[01:57:55.548 --> 01:57:59.310]  But here's the killer for the Fed and it's got them scared to death.
[01:58:15.996 --> 01:58:19.899]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:58:20.119 --> 01:58:25.563]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:58:25.823 --> 01:58:36.211]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:58:36.371 --> 01:58:40.714]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:58:40.914 --> 01:58:44.497]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine
[01:58:44.717 --> 01:58:49.240]  Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:58:49.521 --> 01:58:55.905]  They reduce Nitrate and unwanted metals such as Lead, Mercury, Aluminum, Copper, and Foul taste like Chlorine and Sulfur odors.

[01:59:13.378 --> 01:59:23.806]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:24.066 --> 01:59:28.810]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:34.675]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:34.915 --> 01:59:39.437]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:59:39.657 --> 01:59:46.820]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:50.401]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[01:59:50.421 --> 01:59:51.362]  And much, much more.
[01:59:51.542 --> 01:59:54.064]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:59:54.265 --> 02:00:01.031]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:01:15.572 --> 02:01:20.598]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:20.978 --> 02:01:23.261]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:26.667 --> 02:01:30.930]  We're talking about the doublespeak of the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve Central Bank.
[02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:35.294]  Why did Treasury Secretary O'Neill badmouth the dollar two years ago?
[02:01:35.914 --> 02:01:52.006]  Well, Davos, Switzerland, Economic Forum almost four years ago said that they wanted to empower the euro, make it look good, to get everybody behind that, then say, oh, we've got to have this Pan-American Union to match the euro, when in truth the same people own the stock in the central banks.
[02:01:52.046 --> 02:01:55.289]  It is a European monopoly, with the Rockefellers owning some of it.
[02:01:56.850 --> 02:01:58.452]  And now they're bad-mouthing the dollar.
[02:01:58.472 --> 02:02:02.896]  Treasury Secretary Snowe, the new Treasury Secretary, is bad-mouthing the dollar, saying it needs to go down further.
[02:02:03.517 --> 02:02:09.102]  It's now gone to, what, $1.20, and then back down to $1.12 against the dollar from just $0.90 of the dollar.
[02:02:09.142 --> 02:02:14.607]  So we're in between $0.15 and $0.30 down, depending on how it fluctuates.
[02:02:14.627 --> 02:02:17.069]  They're obviously making products from currency speculation.
[02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:19.612]  George Soros is running around enjoying himself.
[02:02:20.547 --> 02:02:33.012]  Uh, but, uh, so we're trying to cut through the propaganda and find out what's happening with Michael Haga, economist, prosecutor, lawyer, best-selling author, who, and I really trust his forecasting, read some of his books three or four years ago, and it's all happened, unfortunately, as he said it would.
[02:02:33.352 --> 02:02:37.254]  We're really in a depression at many levels right now, but they're just not announcing that to you.
[02:02:37.734 --> 02:02:39.895]  The price-earnings ratios are still out of control.
[02:02:39.955 --> 02:02:41.776]  The debt is at record levels in every sector.
[02:02:42.436 --> 02:02:51.582]  And Michael Hager was telling us why they're in deep trouble right now, or is it part of a greater design to implode things and bring in a crisis of military proportions?
[02:02:51.702 --> 02:02:53.183]  Why are they bad-mouthing the dollar?
[02:02:53.223 --> 02:02:54.124]  What are they afraid of?
[02:02:54.184 --> 02:02:54.904]  Deflation?
[02:02:54.924 --> 02:02:56.145]  Tell us about that, Michael Hager.
[02:02:59.127 --> 02:03:00.367]  Break that down for us, sir.
[02:03:01.368 --> 02:03:03.129]  Chris, we have a guest on, Michael Hager.
[02:03:03.409 --> 02:03:10.694]  Okay, first, we're going to see more terrorism in the United States, because they need more diversion.
[02:03:11.306 --> 02:03:14.689]  And most of the terrorism has come internally, as I believe you know.
[02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:17.111]  It's all part of the plan.
[02:03:17.632 --> 02:03:19.934]  By internally, you mean the establishment's carrying it out?
[02:03:20.194 --> 02:03:20.495]  Yeah.
[02:03:21.576 --> 02:03:26.260]  Yeah, and we're going to see some technology unleashed that's going to scare us all half to death.
[02:03:27.161 --> 02:03:28.982]  So, keep that in mind.
[02:03:29.143 --> 02:03:37.030]  We're going to see some of the new technology to bring down buildings and different things that is going to be absolutely mind-boggling.
[02:03:38.061 --> 02:03:47.711]  But this will all be done by your government, courtesy of your government, to keep your attention diverted from what's really taking place, i.e.
[02:03:47.731 --> 02:03:49.113]  the bankrupting of America.
[02:03:49.994 --> 02:03:53.498]  Now, we're in a deflationary trend worldwide.
[02:03:54.038 --> 02:03:56.761]  This has the central bank scared to death.
[02:03:59.344 --> 02:04:06.551]  The only way they can get people to borrow money, and can expand credit, and get them more deeply in debt, is to have inflation.
[02:04:06.711 --> 02:04:14.118]  In other words, they convince you to borrow money today, and then as your salary goes up next year, you can repay today's debt with cheaper dollars.
[02:04:14.338 --> 02:04:15.860]  And people have done that for years.
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:22.926]  So slowly, you know, we have inflated our way to prosperity.
[02:04:23.067 --> 02:04:24.388]  But there's a downside.
[02:04:26.039 --> 02:04:26.919]  Look at it this way.
[02:04:27.019 --> 02:04:38.042]  Worldwide, central banks can continue to create prosperity out of fiat currencies and credit, as long as you have an ever-expanding pool of borrowers.
[02:04:38.862 --> 02:04:46.004]  Then you create a bankruptcy law that says, okay, if you get maxed out, we'll let you bankrupt out and start over.
[02:04:46.624 --> 02:04:53.626]  But we will ingrain in people that bankruptcy is a terrible thing to do from a moral standpoint, so most people will never do it.
[02:04:54.306 --> 02:04:57.927]  So, we grew up with this scenario for, what, 50 years.
[02:04:58.568 --> 02:05:06.170]  But in the last five years, people began to look at bankruptcy as not being a moral no-no.
[02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:07.751]  They said, hey, let's just do it.
[02:05:07.791 --> 02:05:08.711]  Everybody else is doing it.
[02:05:08.731 --> 02:05:09.812]  Well, that scared the Fed.
[02:05:10.372 --> 02:05:14.673]  So the Fed began putting pressure on Congress to tighten up the bankruptcy laws.
[02:05:14.713 --> 02:05:16.794]  Let's don't let these people walk away from this.
[02:05:17.895 --> 02:05:21.956]  So, right as the world is now deflating, and people are heavily in debt,
[02:05:22.529 --> 02:05:30.294]  And the pool of borrowers needed to continue to inflate and create this false prosperity is declining.
[02:05:30.314 --> 02:05:33.156]  The Fed's caught in a predicament here.
[02:05:34.357 --> 02:05:42.723]  Because if you borrow money today, say you go out and buy a new car, they're saying new cars at 0% financing for five years.
[02:05:43.584 --> 02:05:45.625]  But if suddenly we're having deflation,
[02:05:47.412 --> 02:05:51.215]  In other words, your salary begins to fall, which it's doing.
[02:05:51.255 --> 02:05:52.737]  Look at the airline industry.
[02:05:54.858 --> 02:05:58.762]  American Airlines employees were just given a 17% wage and salary cut.
[02:06:02.193 --> 02:06:03.113]  In their new contract.
[02:06:03.473 --> 02:06:05.014]  It's happening in every industry.
[02:06:05.054 --> 02:06:10.456]  This is like getting somebody strung out on heroin and then reducing the size of their drug allotment.
[02:06:10.476 --> 02:06:12.296]  They'll go into shock.
[02:06:12.496 --> 02:06:14.017]  Yeah, and that's what's happening.
[02:06:14.337 --> 02:06:17.318]  How do you repay that debt today that you borrow?
[02:06:17.358 --> 02:06:21.779]  Say you borrow $10,000 today, but suddenly your salary is going downhill.
[02:06:21.879 --> 02:06:29.781]  Well, even if you're borrowing at a zero interest rate, you're paying 10% or whatever your salary is going down.
[02:06:29.842 --> 02:06:31.282]  So you're paying a real interest rate.
[02:06:32.031 --> 02:06:38.736]  But as we deflate, the borrowers begin to lose their assets through foreclosures.
[02:06:39.217 --> 02:06:48.124]  And it's very interesting, and bankruptcies and all these things, and it is very interesting that the bankruptcy laws are being tightened right at this point in time.
[02:06:48.204 --> 02:06:50.206]  That is part of the plan as well.
[02:06:50.626 --> 02:06:52.327]  You're not going to be able to walk away from your debts.
[02:06:53.048 --> 02:06:57.732]  You're going to become an indentured servant to your lender.
[02:06:58.308 --> 02:07:06.012]  And like Argentina, they'll use the national ID card, that's your driver's license, folks, they just didn't tell you, to then put supplemental credits on there.
[02:07:06.072 --> 02:07:10.674]  You go to federal retraining, it's federally controlled, but it's a private corporation.
[02:07:10.734 --> 02:07:21.879]  I watched Ridge a year and a half ago on TV at a Homeland Security meeting, where they even passed it, saying they're going to have troops in the factories, police, we're going to work for the government, but the profit goes to private corporations.
[02:07:22.299 --> 02:07:24.200]  I mean, this is textbook Soviet Union.
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:24.740]  It is.
[02:07:25.041 --> 02:07:25.941]  And think about it.
[02:07:26.532 --> 02:07:29.805]  More people work for the government today, be it state or federal.
[02:07:30.902 --> 02:07:32.383]  Then work for the private sector.
[02:07:32.443 --> 02:07:44.210]  And so now they'll let you declare bankruptcy, but you'll be an indentured servant to them on a five-year contract, having to work for them on a supplemental job, and they'll own a stake in your house and control it, thus turning everything into public housing.
[02:07:44.470 --> 02:07:44.890]  That's right.
[02:07:45.390 --> 02:07:48.112]  So you further give up a lot of your rights, Alex.
[02:07:48.592 --> 02:07:51.794]  And it's here, we just don't realize.
[02:07:51.834 --> 02:07:59.018]  So they couldn't get us on welfare, get us into the criminal justice system, they'll now just bankrupt us and get us into the debtors' prison.
[02:07:59.678 --> 02:08:02.441]  Well, they're going to come out with a new economic system.
[02:08:03.101 --> 02:08:05.883]  And it's going to be amazing to watch the implementation of this.
[02:08:05.943 --> 02:08:09.206]  Now, we're going to get the new currency this next year again.
[02:08:09.266 --> 02:08:10.927]  Remember, we just got the new currency.
[02:08:10.947 --> 02:08:12.128]  Trading us for changes.
[02:08:12.148 --> 02:08:17.132]  The Federal Reserve Policy Report said they'll be able to devalue it off the RFID chips that are in the money.
[02:08:17.372 --> 02:08:17.633]  Yeah.
[02:08:18.273 --> 02:08:20.915]  And it'll be totally traceable and trackable.
[02:08:21.276 --> 02:08:26.640]  In other words, if you've got a little lucrative business running off the side somewhere in cash,
[02:08:27.378 --> 02:08:27.798]  Forget it.
[02:08:28.139 --> 02:08:29.139]  Not going to happen anymore.
[02:08:29.379 --> 02:08:30.780]  They're going to know everything you do.
[02:08:31.841 --> 02:08:37.845]  So, the new currency is just like having a debit card.
[02:08:38.486 --> 02:08:40.127]  There will be no privacy.
[02:08:41.348 --> 02:08:42.849]  So, people laugh.
[02:08:42.889 --> 02:08:44.170]  They say, that'll never happen.
[02:08:44.250 --> 02:08:45.491]  Well, it's already here.
[02:08:46.712 --> 02:08:51.535]  And we better wake up and smell the roses here, because
[02:08:52.182 --> 02:08:54.063]  We're in the ninth inning of this game.
[02:08:54.483 --> 02:08:56.685]  Now, whether it goes into overtime, I don't know.
[02:08:56.985 --> 02:08:57.605]  None of us know.
[02:08:58.286 --> 02:09:00.027]  But we have a bankrupted nation.
[02:09:00.707 --> 02:09:03.268]  We have a morally bankrupted people.
[02:09:03.569 --> 02:09:08.151]  We have police being trained that torture's good, wearing black ski masks and skull patches.
[02:09:08.811 --> 02:09:13.094]  Well, and we have even armed forces now that
[02:09:14.265 --> 02:09:18.949]  At this Desert Palm testing thing, they ask a question.
[02:09:19.209 --> 02:09:21.911]  Will you fire on American citizens if you've done confiscation?
[02:09:22.171 --> 02:09:22.651]  And they will.
[02:09:23.372 --> 02:09:24.913]  Oh, I have video of them doing it in Police Day 2000.
[02:09:25.013 --> 02:09:26.034]  Let me read you an article.
[02:09:26.374 --> 02:09:26.754]  Okay.
[02:09:27.475 --> 02:09:28.436]  It's by Jim Wolf.
[02:09:28.476 --> 02:09:29.316]  It's a Reuters story.
[02:09:29.356 --> 02:09:33.419]  Pentagon seeks to sort and store lifetime experiences.
[02:09:33.459 --> 02:09:36.722]  This is LifeLog, part of Total Information Awareness Network, today.
[02:09:37.429 --> 02:09:45.173]  The Pentagon is shopping for ways to capture everything a person sees, says, and hears as part of a project it says is meant to help create smarter robots.
[02:09:45.233 --> 02:09:52.057]  Now wait, they admit the DARPA plan is to track and trace us, but oh, now it's about another program because they got in trouble over it.
[02:09:52.557 --> 02:10:02.303]  The projected system called LifeLog would suck in all of a subject's experiences from phone numbers, dialed, emails viewed, every breath taken, step up, and place gone.
[02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:08.744]  And it says, the idea to index the material and make patterns easily retrievable in order to make machines think more like people.
[02:10:08.764 --> 02:10:16.969]  Now wait, a month ago they said that the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or DARPA, the Pentagon's total information awareness, was about watching us for police state.
[02:10:17.289 --> 02:10:21.132]  Now it's, oh it's, we couldn't get the funding so it's a robot program.
[02:10:21.712 --> 02:10:27.336]  And it says the Pentagon's cradle of revolutionary technologies is sponsoring a competition to bring out proposals for setting up such a system.
[02:10:28.076 --> 02:10:29.117]  DARPA announces this.
[02:10:29.537 --> 02:10:35.581]  I got the article five years ago where they put microphones up in Austin, hundreds of them, and DARPA did it.
[02:10:37.062 --> 02:10:41.945]  The face scanning cameras are DARPA, the ID cards are controlled, and the standards are issued by DARPA.
[02:10:42.545 --> 02:10:45.087]  The thumb scanners are going in the grocery stores, in the schools.
[02:10:45.467 --> 02:10:46.588]  This is it, right here.
[02:10:46.608 --> 02:10:47.489]  Yeah, it is.
[02:10:47.809 --> 02:10:51.191]  And it's fascinating, but it's also frightening.
[02:10:52.103 --> 02:10:58.149]  And what's frightening to me is that the American people still seem to be pretty much in the dark.
[02:10:58.229 --> 02:11:00.852]  Well, when you said they're going to watch everything we do, I mean, there it is right there.
[02:11:00.872 --> 02:11:02.113]  Let's take some calls.
[02:11:02.254 --> 02:11:04.856]  John, Louisiana, you're on the air with Michael Hager.
[02:11:04.896 --> 02:11:05.277]  Go ahead.
[02:11:05.517 --> 02:11:07.359]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex and Mike.
[02:11:07.399 --> 02:11:08.720]  It's a great pleasure to hear you again, Mike.
[02:11:09.061 --> 02:11:15.207]  Mike, I think a few of us understand that the government, the federal budget, only includes 80% of the total spending.
[02:11:15.607 --> 02:11:21.729]  That 20% of the money being spent is done on a black budget for the CIA and other things.
[02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:29.631]  Now, we also know that the Washington Times is the only major newspaper in the country that's supporting the Bushy regime.
[02:11:29.651 --> 02:11:31.792]  That and their magazine Insight.
[02:11:31.812 --> 02:11:32.652]  Well, that's a staged deal.
[02:11:32.672 --> 02:11:33.893]  Let me add something, Hager.
[02:11:33.933 --> 02:11:38.714]  What about the $1 trillion missing in the last 8 years from the Pentagon they just calmly announced?
[02:11:38.914 --> 02:11:40.455]  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing.
[02:11:41.035 --> 02:11:46.137]  And actually, John, it's like 35% of the real spending is off budget.
[02:11:46.497 --> 02:11:48.138]  Now, listen to this.
[02:11:48.158 --> 02:11:58.403]  Sun Mooney, who owns The Washington Times, is subsidizing most of the televangelist celebrities.
[02:11:58.823 --> 02:12:00.864]  Now, he's doing this in various ways.
[02:12:01.284 --> 02:12:10.811]  Now, is it possible that the CIA is funneling huge amounts of money into Mooney because Mooney is losing money on every one of his businesses that he runs?
[02:12:11.051 --> 02:12:12.132]  How does that grab you?
[02:12:12.993 --> 02:12:16.916]  It wouldn't surprise me, and look at it this way too, John.
[02:12:17.666 --> 02:12:19.709]  Again, our preachers are corrupt.
[02:12:19.769 --> 02:12:20.890]  They don't realize it.
[02:12:21.351 --> 02:12:26.537]  Most churches are 501c3 non-profit organizations.
[02:12:26.577 --> 02:12:29.841]  They're licensed by the state, not by God.
[02:12:30.341 --> 02:12:33.125]  If you make contributions to your church,
[02:12:33.812 --> 02:12:42.126]  Those are reported if the church is a non-profit to the IRS, who then compares those totals against your tax return.
[02:12:42.626 --> 02:12:47.855]  But yet, the government knows everything you give to your church if you're attending a non-profit church.
[02:12:48.636 --> 02:12:52.557]  And yet, we can't have a copy of the Ten Commandments in a courthouse.
[02:12:52.957 --> 02:12:56.178]  Because there's supposed to be separation of church and state.
[02:12:56.298 --> 02:12:59.639]  The CIA is subsidizing the Christian conservative movement.
[02:12:59.719 --> 02:13:05.160]  Well, I don't know about Mooney, but I do know that there's a film out about the preachers.
[02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:06.461]  A lot of them are government operatives.
[02:13:06.701 --> 02:13:07.321]  Thanks for the call.
[02:13:07.341 --> 02:13:09.321]  More calls from Michael Hague on the other side at 800-259-9231.
[02:13:09.341 --> 02:13:10.882]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:13:15.956 --> 02:13:19.860]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:25.525]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:13:25.805 --> 02:13:36.175]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:13:36.335 --> 02:13:40.679]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:13:40.859 --> 02:13:49.224]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:13:49.504 --> 02:13:55.868]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:13:55.989 --> 02:14:00.451]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[02:15:17.951 --> 02:15:21.915]  Media, press, and government support even perpetrate lies to degrade your rights and independence.
[02:15:22.155 --> 02:15:25.858]  The liberally biased populist assaults your mind in order to take advantage of your soul.
[02:15:26.119 --> 02:15:28.941]  Fight back every day with the 2003 Freedom Calendar.
[02:15:29.061 --> 02:15:31.003]  Available by calling Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:15:33.505 --> 02:15:34.967]  Your rights were granted by God.
[02:15:35.187 --> 02:15:37.070]  Government should only exist to protect those rights.
[02:15:37.290 --> 02:15:38.972]  This calendar affirms your ideals.
[02:15:39.173 --> 02:15:41.616]  It shows you where your rights are protected in the Constitution.
[02:15:41.816 --> 02:15:45.881]  Fight the good fight with the help of the 2003 Freedom Calendar and Midas Resources.
[02:15:46.082 --> 02:15:47.483]  Call 800-687-2237.
[02:15:48.765 --> 02:15:49.406]  Know your rights.
[02:15:49.566 --> 02:15:51.749]  The rights that will save you from a corrupted Republic.
[02:15:51.889 --> 02:15:53.110]  We want you to spread the word.
[02:15:53.330 --> 02:15:56.112]  Prices decrease significantly when the quantity ordered is increased.
[02:15:56.292 --> 02:15:56.812]  Call now.
[02:15:56.832 --> 02:15:57.353]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:15:57.413 --> 02:16:01.295]  Unity is the only way to overcome.
[02:16:01.535 --> 02:16:03.096]  Know your rights, granted by God.
[02:16:03.397 --> 02:16:05.818]  The very rights our government was created to protect.
[02:16:05.978 --> 02:16:08.600]  The Freedom Calendar is available now at Midas Resources.
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:08.880]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:10.701]  Get it now and start spreading the truth.
[02:16:15.456 --> 02:16:16.197]  Are you prepared?
[02:16:16.397 --> 02:16:18.781]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[02:16:19.001 --> 02:16:23.447]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[02:16:23.747 --> 02:16:27.212]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[02:16:27.452 --> 02:16:29.595]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[02:16:30.336 --> 02:16:34.297]  Jerry Geddy from the Ark Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[02:16:34.537 --> 02:16:37.458]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[02:16:37.578 --> 02:16:44.660]  Call the Ark Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:50.181]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[02:16:50.441 --> 02:16:55.463]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[02:16:55.683 --> 02:16:56.703]  Jerry can help here too.
[02:16:57.523 --> 02:17:02.206]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[02:17:02.426 --> 02:17:06.349]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:10.612]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll-free, 1-800-255-1912.
[02:17:10.672 --> 02:17:15.315]  That's 800-255-1912, or visit arkinstitute.com.
[02:17:16.755 --> 02:17:23.360]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:26.346 --> 02:17:27.807]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:17:30.008 --> 02:17:32.148]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Ohio.
[02:17:32.189 --> 02:17:33.729]  You're on the air with our guest, Michael Hager.
[02:17:33.749 --> 02:17:34.509]  Go ahead, Steve.
[02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:35.710]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:17:35.730 --> 02:17:36.910]  Good afternoon, Mr. Hager.
[02:17:37.891 --> 02:17:44.093]  Mr. Hager, I first started listening to you back around 1992, 1993 on the American Freedom Network.
[02:17:44.454 --> 02:17:45.194]  Uh-huh.
[02:17:45.214 --> 02:17:46.835]  And I listened to you religiously back then.
[02:17:46.875 --> 02:17:52.317]  I was working in a bank myself, handling the mutual funds and annuities and other insurance products for the bank.
[02:17:53.567 --> 02:17:54.627]  Yeah, I took your advice.
[02:17:55.007 --> 02:18:06.690]  I got out of the market when the Dow Jones was setting at 3300, and I bought $410-$15 gold, and I'm still waiting for my gold to come back, and the market's been to 11.6 and back and forth.
[02:18:06.710 --> 02:18:09.590]  I bought a few of your books, and I put them up on my bookcase.
[02:18:10.290 --> 02:18:14.531]  They're right beside my copies of The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey.
[02:18:15.872 --> 02:18:18.012]  You said in that book that you were a little bit premature.
[02:18:18.232 --> 02:18:21.253]  I guess you were about seven or eight years on the peak of the market.
[02:18:23.257 --> 02:18:37.592]  What I'm hearing you say today, Mr. Haggett, with all due respect, is anybody that reads Alex Jones's InfoWars.net or InfoWars.com and stays impressed with the current mainstream publications and stuff.
[02:18:37.872 --> 02:18:39.915]  I'm not hearing anything new out of you, Mr. Haggett.
[02:18:39.955 --> 02:18:41.096]  I'm still waiting for the $3,000 to $5,000 gold.
[02:18:41.116 --> 02:18:42.337]  Well, have you been watching gold?
[02:18:46.246 --> 02:18:47.147]  Yeah, I've been watching it.
[02:18:47.168 --> 02:18:49.631]  I've been watching it for the last nine years, you know.
[02:18:49.812 --> 02:18:52.275]  Well, I haven't recommended it that far back.
[02:18:52.456 --> 02:18:53.958]  Oh, yeah, you were on American Freedom.
[02:18:53.998 --> 02:18:57.023]  Now, I've listened to you religiously back then and would call into your talk shows.
[02:18:57.123 --> 02:18:58.425]  Well, didn't they start in 1995?
[02:18:58.465 --> 02:18:58.685]  What, the...
[02:19:02.182 --> 02:19:02.462]  Me?
[02:19:03.103 --> 02:19:05.844]  Yeah, I wasn't even back on the air back then.
[02:19:06.084 --> 02:19:06.664]  Oh yeah, you were.
[02:19:06.684 --> 02:19:08.085]  American Freedom Administration, I guess.
[02:19:08.105 --> 02:19:09.866]  Well, sir, I believe that organization started in 95.
[02:19:10.527 --> 02:19:12.508]  I'm not saying you're... Well, they changed their name in 95.
[02:19:12.728 --> 02:19:14.289]  They used to be something else.
[02:19:14.349 --> 02:19:15.109]  I forget what it was.
[02:19:15.169 --> 02:19:16.930]  Okay, well let me just tell you something.
[02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:22.665]  Uh, we, the Davos Switzerland people said they were going to plunge the dollar almost four years ago.
[02:19:22.945 --> 02:19:23.866]  Right, I understand.
[02:19:24.107 --> 02:19:27.110]  Well, I've been saying... I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying, Mr. Jones.
[02:19:27.130 --> 02:19:29.072]  You've been right on the money for some time now.
[02:19:29.372 --> 02:19:32.735]  Okay, well, well... I'm just saying Mr. Hague is just a parrot.
[02:19:32.795 --> 02:19:38.841]  He's, he's, he's... Well, okay, well let me say this, okay, because he's our guest and you can say you disagree with him and please no name-calling.
[02:19:39.342 --> 02:19:41.384]  Let me just, because I'm not going to censor you, let me say this right now.
[02:19:42.583 --> 02:19:48.185]  The PE ratios in the mid-90s were, what, 30 to 1?
[02:19:48.426 --> 02:19:51.827]  They hit 40 to 50 to 1, 60 to 1 on some of the stocks.
[02:19:52.407 --> 02:19:53.908]  Now, that was insane there.
[02:19:53.988 --> 02:19:57.269]  The bubble did get a lot bigger than most people thought it could, and then it did plunge.
[02:19:57.570 --> 02:20:06.674]  The advice I got from Hager three or four years ago, with the few stocks I had, was get out then, when it was at 11,000, and I made a little bit of profit, because I didn't own very many stocks.
[02:20:06.814 --> 02:20:07.694]  He was saying, get out back.
[02:20:07.754 --> 02:20:08.895]  All I know is I did good
[02:20:12.176 --> 02:20:12.356]  Oh, sure.
[02:20:12.376 --> 02:20:13.617]  You know, we have been premature.
[02:20:34.838 --> 02:20:38.801]  And nobody expected the Dow to crest at 11,722.
[02:20:38.941 --> 02:20:42.264]  Well, you said that a month ago when you were on without him calling in.
[02:20:42.664 --> 02:20:51.450]  Yeah, and I kept saying when I was on the radio that it was time to begin unloading stocks, but we were still in some stocks.
[02:20:52.271 --> 02:20:53.232]  And we did very well.
[02:20:53.572 --> 02:20:58.015]  Four years ago is when I told people, get out of this market completely.
[02:20:58.095 --> 02:20:59.696]  That's when you wrote the crash book.
[02:20:59.996 --> 02:21:03.339]  Yeah, and we did, and we made money, and guess what?
[02:21:04.322 --> 02:21:07.005]  The Dow dropped back down to, what, 72.86?
[02:21:07.045 --> 02:21:17.115]  Now, there's been a modest rebound, but we're three years into a great bust, and people are still believing in the promise of a boom.
[02:21:17.456 --> 02:21:19.358]  What is the average 401k down by, like, 60%?
[02:21:19.398 --> 02:21:20.119]  Some are down by 90%?
[02:21:20.159 --> 02:21:20.679]  Some are down, yeah, 90.
[02:21:20.739 --> 02:21:22.521]  Some have gone completely under.
[02:21:27.333 --> 02:21:32.475]  So, you can sit there and believe in all of this, or you can prepare.
[02:21:32.495 --> 02:21:37.857]  Alright, let Steve respond to that, or John, excuse me.
[02:21:37.897 --> 02:21:38.538]  Go ahead, John.
[02:21:39.318 --> 02:21:40.058]  I'm still Steve.
[02:21:41.139 --> 02:21:45.401]  I agree, I've been prepared for some time now, and continue to prepare.
[02:21:46.141 --> 02:21:48.162]  We've got a lot to prepare for.
[02:21:48.182 --> 02:21:51.063]  Well, you hear Mr. Hage, he's not even recommending stocks or anything.
[02:21:51.624 --> 02:21:53.507]  Well no, he hasn't been for some time.
[02:21:53.688 --> 02:21:55.831]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:21:55.912 --> 02:21:57.494]  Today he's correct.
[02:21:58.696 --> 02:22:01.501]  Would you rather Lou Dobbs five years ago tell you how great Enron is?
[02:22:02.323 --> 02:22:02.503]  No.
[02:22:05.311 --> 02:22:15.539]  Well, you know that he may not have foreseen also the Federal Reserve, and they've been sued over this, artificially depressing the price of gold by making large sales amongst their own banks at incredibly reduced prices.
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:18.802]  See, I mean... I'm not impugning your information, Alex.
[02:22:18.942 --> 02:22:20.063]  Don't misunderstand what I'm saying.
[02:22:20.083 --> 02:22:20.824]  No, you can if you want.
[02:22:21.124 --> 02:22:25.187]  I'm just saying... Mr. Hage, any comments to the gold situation?
[02:22:26.068 --> 02:22:28.510]  Well, I'll clear off and wait for somebody else.
[02:22:28.530 --> 02:22:29.391]  Thank you, Steve.
[02:22:30.592 --> 02:22:31.993]  Gold is telling us
[02:22:32.802 --> 02:22:35.986]  That the Fed is trying desperately to inflate.
[02:22:37.168 --> 02:22:40.653]  But it is telling us that deflation is coming.
[02:22:41.774 --> 02:22:45.079]  And that means that these currencies will collapse.
[02:22:46.306 --> 02:22:47.507]  Well, I mean, look at the Euro.
[02:22:47.547 --> 02:22:48.488]  Partially gold back.
[02:22:48.508 --> 02:22:49.389]  Look at the DNR.
[02:22:49.869 --> 02:22:52.191]  Yeah, anything with gold in it is going up.
[02:22:52.571 --> 02:22:54.193]  And gold is telling us what's coming.
[02:22:54.553 --> 02:22:54.853]  All right.
[02:22:55.714 --> 02:22:59.317]  Mr. Haga, I know you're supposed to go now, but stay with us another five minutes, because I want to go to John in New York.
[02:22:59.337 --> 02:22:59.637]  All right.
[02:22:59.657 --> 02:23:00.418]  A few others.
[02:23:00.458 --> 02:23:02.299]  He can respond also to what Steve was saying.
[02:23:02.319 --> 02:23:03.260]  We'll be right back.
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:03.900]  Thanks for being with us.
[02:23:06.202 --> 02:23:07.103]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.583 --> 02:23:09.205]  The empire's on the run.
[02:23:10.126 --> 02:23:12.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.876 --> 02:23:16.477]  Hello, folks.
[02:23:16.497 --> 02:23:17.498]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:23:17.858 --> 02:23:23.603]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:23:23.843 --> 02:23:26.586]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the... 4438.

[02:23:43.929 --> 02:23:47.250]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:53.592]  Monday through Friday from 11am until 2pm Central Standard Time.
[02:23:53.632 --> 02:23:55.352]  I'm here live and back from 9am to midnight.
[02:23:55.372 --> 02:23:58.433]  I'm just going to keep Michael Hague on for another 5 minutes or so to talk to John in New York.
[02:23:59.193 --> 02:24:01.974]  Then I'll take some of the other calls and get into some of the other news I haven't covered yet.
[02:24:02.194 --> 02:24:02.694]  Stay with us.
[02:24:03.475 --> 02:24:04.575]  But Mr. Hague,
[02:24:05.579 --> 02:24:17.365]  Any other comments about these markets and the insanity, and also more about your meeting you had with Greenspan, because we said we were going to talk about that, and then how do folks get your books, what books would you recommend?
[02:24:18.265 --> 02:24:22.087]  Well, let me just say one other thing to Steve here, too.
[02:24:22.767 --> 02:24:31.131]  The first book that I wrote, the title is On the Brink, How to Survive the Coming Great Depression, developing between 1993 and the year 2000.
[02:24:34.031 --> 02:24:36.692]  And 2000 was the peak in the stock market.
[02:24:38.113 --> 02:24:42.195]  And we did recommend getting rid of some stocks, maybe too early.
[02:24:43.095 --> 02:24:45.076]  But I think we've been right on track.
[02:24:45.576 --> 02:24:50.498]  So maybe, you know, maybe Steve wants to go back through and read those books again.
[02:24:50.518 --> 02:25:01.043]  A lot of people Richard Lamb, former governor of Colorado is good friend of mine wrote, you know, prologue in the book, I've had a lot of people that
[02:25:02.307 --> 02:25:03.547]  Well, I was just saying,
[02:25:27.228 --> 02:25:30.549]  You also, again, have talked to Greenspan, and you've talked to this couple.
[02:25:30.569 --> 02:25:31.790]  I wanted to hear more about that.
[02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:33.010]  This was interesting.
[02:25:34.251 --> 02:25:40.573]  On the 13th and 14th of May, I was fortunate to be in Washington, D.C.
[02:25:41.534 --> 02:25:47.576]  I went to the National Economist Club in Washington, and Alan Greenspan was there.
[02:25:47.596 --> 02:25:49.957]  He gave a talk on the economy.
[02:25:51.257 --> 02:25:55.719]  And it was very interesting, and I got to talk to him after this meeting.
[02:25:56.989 --> 02:26:03.672]  And he stated, gosh, clear back in November 20, let's see, the last meeting was, the prior meeting was November 21, 2002.
[02:26:04.632 --> 02:26:19.038]  And he said at that meeting, with inflation rates now quite low in the United States, some have expressed concern that we may soon face a new problem, the danger of deflation or falling prices.
[02:26:20.254 --> 02:26:23.435]  This concern is not purely hypothetical.
[02:26:23.495 --> 02:26:48.166]  It's brought home to us whenever we read newspaper reports about Japan, where what seems to be a relatively moderate deflation, a decline in consumer prices about 1% a year, has been associated with years of painfully slow growth, rising joblessness, apparently intractable financial problems in the banking and corporate sectors, and it goes on and on.
[02:26:48.246 --> 02:26:48.586]  He does.
[02:26:49.361 --> 02:26:50.842]  Now, that was on November 21.
[02:26:51.843 --> 02:26:57.447]  At that previous meeting, he said, could it happen in America?
[02:26:57.467 --> 02:27:02.931]  It is possible, but not probable.
[02:27:03.351 --> 02:27:18.822]  Now, at the May 13 and 14 meeting at the National Economist Club, Greenspan said, it is not only probable, it is very possible.
[02:27:19.972 --> 02:27:23.055]  That we are going to have deflation in America.
[02:27:23.195 --> 02:27:25.117]  Well, he was on the news saying that, too.
[02:27:25.578 --> 02:27:31.804]  Well, I asked him later, what do you actually believe is going to happen here?
[02:27:32.724 --> 02:27:35.247]  And he said, we are very concerned about deflation.
[02:27:36.681 --> 02:27:39.683]  We, you know, can the central bank lose control?
[02:27:40.024 --> 02:27:47.229]  Could we go into a very severe period of contracting falling prices?
[02:27:47.569 --> 02:27:48.450]  Well, how then?
[02:27:48.910 --> 02:27:50.331]  It's already happening in real estate.
[02:27:50.712 --> 02:27:51.412]  Yeah.
[02:27:51.632 --> 02:27:57.157]  I mean, Austin's the hottest real estate market in the country, they say, per capita, and the prices are plunging here.
[02:27:57.417 --> 02:27:58.958]  Yeah, and they are here as well.
[02:28:00.069 --> 02:28:06.230]  So, the man is very concerned, and I said, do you think deflation really is going to envelop America?
[02:28:06.250 --> 02:28:06.890]  And he said, yes.
[02:28:07.170 --> 02:28:08.330]  Alright, let's take a call.
[02:28:08.350 --> 02:28:09.671]  Let's talk to John in New York.
[02:28:10.071 --> 02:28:11.491]  John, last caller from Michael Hager.
[02:28:11.511 --> 02:28:12.871]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:28:12.891 --> 02:28:13.651]  Yeah, Mr. Jones.
[02:28:15.972 --> 02:28:21.953]  Protecting Mr. Hager, as you did from the last caller, was noble of you, but we read his book.
[02:28:22.013 --> 02:28:26.834]  I'm calling you from the Economics Department at Syracuse University, up here in Syracuse, New York.
[02:28:27.434 --> 02:28:29.214]  Some of my students have read
[02:28:29.881 --> 02:28:32.002]  Mr. Hager's book had used it as a reference.
[02:28:32.062 --> 02:28:36.345]  Mr. Hager needs to go back to read his book, Mr. Jones.
[02:28:36.945 --> 02:28:38.266]  Here's the point you're missing.
[02:28:38.286 --> 02:28:40.047]  Here's the point he's missing.
[02:28:40.927 --> 02:28:54.515]  The lawsuit that's going on in New Orleans right now, Mr. Hager, about gold and intrinsic value, and the manipulation of the gold market, which you touched on many times in the past, because I've listened to you speak also.
[02:28:55.623 --> 02:29:06.108]  Here's the thing, that all this gold that Greenspan needs, and desperately wants, because at one time Greenspan wanted to back the money with gold.
[02:29:06.128 --> 02:29:09.330]  Yeah, I've got an essay you wrote in 1968.
[02:29:09.630 --> 02:29:12.291]  Right, it backed away from his own ideas.
[02:29:12.811 --> 02:29:22.396]  These ideas are going to come to the forefront again, because instead of deflation, if you look at it real, real close, the economy is retracting
[02:29:22.996 --> 02:29:27.717]  Because at the same time, transportation, Mr. Hager, is civilization.
[02:29:28.037 --> 02:29:29.978]  Roger Kipling said that, by the way.
[02:29:30.458 --> 02:29:35.019]  And transportation is forcing the economy to retract.
[02:29:36.059 --> 02:29:41.600]  Because the price of fuel is driving everything in a different direction than it was before.
[02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:48.122]  Well, what you're saying is that we have massive inflation on key items, and we said that on the cars, on the fuel,
[02:29:49.163 --> 02:29:50.764]  Let me give you an example, Mr. Jones.
[02:29:51.224 --> 02:29:53.005]  Mr. Jones, let me give you a great example.
[02:29:53.685 --> 02:30:01.609]  40 octane diesel, right now, 40 octane diesel, in New York, is as much as
[02:30:02.693 --> 02:30:05.154]  94 octane low-lead gasoline.
[02:30:05.494 --> 02:30:08.014]  That's a paradigm shift in the economy.
[02:30:08.354 --> 02:30:23.078]  I've had students bring that to my attention, that we are suffering a paradigm shift in economics where the first time the trucking industry is having to pay as much for diesel as the guy who drives the hot rod who burns 94 octane gas.
[02:30:23.198 --> 02:30:24.498]  And the heating oil.
[02:30:25.158 --> 02:30:26.059]  Explain that to me!
[02:30:26.179 --> 02:30:31.023]  Well, yeah, it's stupid because it's cheaper to produce diesel.
[02:30:31.043 --> 02:30:32.083]  Mr. Haig, any comments?
[02:30:32.784 --> 02:30:35.866]  Well, the paradigm shift is going to come in the future.
[02:30:35.886 --> 02:30:39.269]  You know, we're in this war for oil.
[02:30:43.191 --> 02:30:50.436]  But the paradigm shift in the future is going to be a new vehicle of fueling.
[02:30:51.437 --> 02:31:02.144]  We're getting away from the oil-driven economies in the coming future to a whole different type of fuel, which even Bush has talked about, the fuel cells.
[02:31:02.164 --> 02:31:04.205]  Do you speculate, Mr. Hager, what it's going to be?
[02:31:04.245 --> 02:31:07.567]  Do you think we're going to go to methane, hydrogen, or are we going to go to plutonium?
[02:31:08.388 --> 02:31:09.589]  You know, I don't know.
[02:31:09.769 --> 02:31:11.030]  That's the key.
[02:31:12.303 --> 02:31:14.645]  Uh, but that will be the paradigm shift.
[02:31:15.045 --> 02:31:18.527]  I can't tell you which way we're going to shift there.
[02:31:18.847 --> 02:31:25.231]  Why is distilled gasoline at 94 octane cost as much as non-distilled diesel fuel at 40 octane?
[02:31:25.291 --> 02:31:27.092]  Well, sir, it's a scam they're running.
[02:31:27.272 --> 02:31:28.353]  Sure it is.
[02:31:28.453 --> 02:31:31.055]  Everything is a scam to you, Mr. Jones.
[02:31:31.315 --> 02:31:32.596]  Something's got to be legit.
[02:31:32.636 --> 02:31:35.277]  The boys that are calling the shots have got to tell us what's going on.
[02:31:35.317 --> 02:31:35.998]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:31:36.198 --> 02:31:36.558]  Hold on.
[02:31:36.578 --> 02:31:38.559]  You need to settle down a little bit, number one, sir.
[02:31:38.979 --> 02:31:40.620]  You need to settle down just a little bit and let me talk.
[02:31:41.081 --> 02:31:41.461]  Now, look.
[02:31:43.243 --> 02:31:49.687]  Exxon and Mobil, Exxon Mobil, BP, Dutch Rochelle, they're all posting record profits.
[02:31:50.808 --> 02:32:01.415]  Their own Project for an American Century written by Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz says the invasion of Iraq is to grab oil and to have a military base to invade Syria and Iran.
[02:32:01.775 --> 02:32:02.956]  So I go with what they say.
[02:32:02.996 --> 02:32:04.177]  You say everything's a
[02:32:04.949 --> 02:32:08.512]  So that means that fuel is inflating?
[02:32:33.464 --> 02:32:35.085]  Well, that's what we said when we first started.
[02:32:35.806 --> 02:32:41.629]  Okay, they claim there isn't inflation, but on key issues, like automobiles and fuel, it's going up.
[02:32:42.029 --> 02:32:55.638]  But then at the same time, they're going to de-inflate many sectors of the economy where you cannot physically then have the money to go and buy those more expensive items or pay yourself out of the debt by the increase in your pay each year.
[02:32:55.678 --> 02:32:57.079]  So they're manipulating things.
[02:32:57.099 --> 02:32:57.999]  They're squeezing you.
[02:32:58.019 --> 02:33:01.982]  They're having more fines, more fees, more checkpoints, more arrests.
[02:33:02.626 --> 02:33:06.707]  At a hundred levels, they're turning up the heat while removing the capacity to pay.
[02:33:06.947 --> 02:33:07.847]  Can't you understand?
[02:33:07.887 --> 02:33:08.587]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:33:08.807 --> 02:33:16.528]  Can't you understand that they increase the price of essentials, okay, while decreasing the overall worth of the currency and what's your pay?
[02:33:16.608 --> 02:33:18.129]  Take Argentina, okay?
[02:33:18.149 --> 02:33:25.890]  They blow out the economy, grab people's bank accounts, and then triple the price of water and heating oil overnight to cause pressure.
[02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:27.850]  They call it the IMF riot.
[02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:29.171]  I've had Greg Powles on.
[02:33:29.491 --> 02:33:31.271]  They engineer riots and looting.
[02:33:31.471 --> 02:33:35.414]  Then there's a police state crackdown, then they put in one of their client governments.
[02:33:35.454 --> 02:33:37.395]  Michael Hagan, am I accurate on this?
[02:33:37.715 --> 02:33:39.116]  I believe you're very accurate, Alex.
[02:33:39.256 --> 02:33:45.520]  And the paradigm shift in the future, right now, there is a battle taking place.
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:49.342]  The central banks can only have control through inflation.
[02:33:49.803 --> 02:33:56.427]  And inflation is good for the oil industry and everything else because they're taking more of your disposable dollars.
[02:33:57.313 --> 02:34:12.732]  But the battle is between the inflationists, the credit markets, those in control of the financial markets, and the people who are running out of the ability to be able to borrow at any price.
[02:34:16.348 --> 02:34:18.009]  Sounds like a right-wing attack dog.
[02:34:18.049 --> 02:34:19.631]  Anything else you want to add, Johnny?
[02:34:19.671 --> 02:34:20.351]  What are you getting at?
[02:34:20.371 --> 02:34:26.416]  You say Mr. Haggis should read his own book, and then you come out and agree with us that they're doing it, and then you say it's not a scam.
[02:34:26.456 --> 02:34:27.417]  What do you think, John?
[02:34:28.218 --> 02:34:30.279]  Well, I don't think it's a scam for one reason.
[02:34:30.560 --> 02:34:30.920]  Oh, okay.
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:32.501]  And you better hear me out on this one.
[02:34:33.182 --> 02:34:40.548]  It's not a scam because if anybody was to talk about supply and demand, and whoever's dog that is, please be quiet.
[02:34:41.395 --> 02:34:59.026]  Is that supply and demand at these moments if you go to the Wall Street Journal and read the supply of oil that's available it's at record levels yet the fuel that's being distilled at the refinery level
[02:34:59.762 --> 02:35:02.405]  Once it gets there, it's being manipulated.
[02:35:02.745 --> 02:35:03.806]  Is that a scam, Mr. Jones?
[02:35:03.826 --> 02:35:04.287]  Of course it isn't.
[02:35:24.156 --> 02:35:26.918]  Oh, it's not a scam for profit, and they have more oil.
[02:35:26.958 --> 02:35:34.902]  If all Americans believe that these guys are always running a scam, then there's no consensus, Mr. Jones.
[02:35:34.922 --> 02:35:37.564]  That means that they do whatever they feel like.
[02:35:37.684 --> 02:35:39.725]  John, come on.
[02:35:40.626 --> 02:35:41.646]  Splash some water on your face.
[02:35:41.666 --> 02:35:42.267]  Thanks for the call.
[02:35:43.087 --> 02:35:45.629]  Michael Hager, that was nuts what I just heard.
[02:35:45.669 --> 02:35:47.030]  He said... Look, look.
[02:35:49.211 --> 02:35:52.633]  People are... and part of the paradigm shift here, Alex, is this.
[02:35:53.194 --> 02:36:10.497]  And this is one of the things that I went through, and I'll say this to both Steve and John, when you grow up and you attend traditional universities and you get all these degrees and you go to work for these corporations, and we helped build Columbia HCA, which is now HCA, the world's largest health care organization.
[02:36:11.117 --> 02:36:22.399]  I believed in these things, but the people at the top, which is what I managed to rise to, become, I guess, insulated from
[02:36:23.331 --> 02:36:28.034]  The people that provide the means to build everything.
[02:36:28.054 --> 02:36:30.495]  In their ivory towers, they can't see what it's doing to the villagers.
[02:36:30.555 --> 02:36:35.377]  No, and so you're sitting there figuring out ways to line your own pockets.
[02:36:35.978 --> 02:36:48.284]  But Michael, how could he say there's more oil, which is true, and it gets to the refineries and we pay record amounts, and then say that's not a scam when they're posting record profits?
[02:36:48.324 --> 02:36:50.005]  I mean, I don't understand what he just said.
[02:36:50.165 --> 02:36:51.646]  Well, he totally contradicted himself.
[02:36:52.722 --> 02:36:58.987]  Because it is a scam when you're taking more of the disposable income of the people.
[02:36:59.007 --> 02:37:02.650]  And you have a bigger supply and it costs more.
[02:37:03.150 --> 02:37:03.371]  Yeah.
[02:37:03.571 --> 02:37:05.392]  A bigger supply means price goes down.
[02:37:06.073 --> 02:37:09.436]  Why are they teaching at this guy's school if he doesn't understand that?
[02:37:09.796 --> 02:37:15.701]  Well, look, economists today are econometricians.
[02:37:15.781 --> 02:37:18.623]  They plug everything in computer-generated models.
[02:37:19.238 --> 02:37:26.041]  They're more attuned to a statistician or a math major, because nobody understands history.
[02:37:27.461 --> 02:37:44.628]  So, they leave out the historical equation, and the politics, and the people... But I mean, I told him, Michael, I said, we have the White House, constituted a cabinet, during the election, before that, in 96, they funded the Project for an American Century, they wrote policy reports, 1999-2000, saying it was about oil,
[02:37:47.427 --> 02:37:52.791]  Saying it was about a military economy, and then he calls and he says, oh, we won't have any consensus if you say that.
[02:37:53.011 --> 02:37:53.672]  I didn't say it!
[02:37:53.872 --> 02:37:54.873]  The President did!
[02:37:55.333 --> 02:37:55.553]  Yeah.
[02:37:55.853 --> 02:37:56.093]  Yeah.
[02:37:56.574 --> 02:38:00.136]  So... What do you say to these people?
[02:38:00.276 --> 02:38:00.957]  I don't know, Alex.
[02:38:01.397 --> 02:38:06.501]  It's like Jeffrey Dahmer admitting he has the bodies in the refrigerator, and they go, oh no, we don't want to say he did this.
[02:38:06.781 --> 02:38:07.041]  Yeah.
[02:38:07.542 --> 02:38:07.782]  Yeah.
[02:38:08.262 --> 02:38:09.923]  Alright, how do folks get your book?
[02:38:10.504 --> 02:38:11.545]  What books would you recommend?
[02:38:12.125 --> 02:38:16.108]  Well, they can read After the Crash, How to Survive the Coming Great Depression,
[02:38:17.234 --> 02:38:18.694]  I believe you can get it online now.
[02:38:19.194 --> 02:38:21.035]  The small publisher was bought out.
[02:38:21.155 --> 02:38:27.256]  I've got some new books coming out from a major publishing house in New York, and they took over all the rights.
[02:38:27.376 --> 02:38:30.576]  So they're going to be bringing these things back out.
[02:38:30.616 --> 02:38:34.037]  So I don't know what, just go online or your bookstores and see.
[02:38:34.057 --> 02:38:38.618]  It depends on what the publishers do, I suppose.
[02:38:39.418 --> 02:38:42.098]  But Alex, the bottom line is this.
[02:38:43.999 --> 02:38:45.279]  I'm not here to sell books.
[02:38:45.599 --> 02:38:46.379]  I could care less.
[02:38:48.008 --> 02:38:49.529]  You know, I've got a good life.
[02:38:50.469 --> 02:38:53.970]  But the American people had better wake up.
[02:38:54.851 --> 02:38:55.791]  And it is scary.
[02:38:56.551 --> 02:39:07.315]  And when I first started talking about these issues, it was the result of years of learning and observing and going back and studying history.
[02:39:07.335 --> 02:39:09.236]  And it was a shock.
[02:39:09.396 --> 02:39:13.177]  And when I first heard people like yourself, I thought, these people are crazy.
[02:39:14.378 --> 02:39:14.578]  But
[02:39:15.430 --> 02:39:23.652]  Any radical idea or any idea that is contrary to what we've been taught is radical.
[02:39:23.792 --> 02:39:25.793]  Yeah, we shouldn't have black people as slaves.
[02:39:25.833 --> 02:39:26.553]  That was radical in 1800.
[02:39:26.753 --> 02:39:27.273]  Yeah.
[02:39:27.873 --> 02:39:28.954]  The world is round.
[02:39:28.994 --> 02:39:30.574]  That was radical in 1620.
[02:39:30.634 --> 02:39:38.616]  And the fact that we're talking about America ending as we know it is radical.
[02:39:38.936 --> 02:39:41.057]  But right before our eyes, it's unfolding.
[02:39:41.337 --> 02:39:43.698]  You read their policy reports, they say they're going to do it, Michael.
[02:39:43.998 --> 02:39:44.478]  Yeah, they are.
[02:39:45.309 --> 02:39:53.173]  And they're doing it every day, and they're doing it through our schools, and through our churches, and through our financial organizations, and even through health care.
[02:39:53.193 --> 02:39:56.675]  Well, Michael, I've had you on about five, six times over the years, a few times the last few months.
[02:39:56.715 --> 02:40:08.641]  I've never heard callers like this, and it was... The last guy was totally incoherent, and it sounded like frustration and anger just at the system itself spilling over in hysteria is what it sounded like to me.
[02:40:09.621 --> 02:40:10.662]  Well, it doesn't bother me.
[02:40:11.405 --> 02:40:13.906]  You know, you can... Well, no, it scares me for them.
[02:40:13.986 --> 02:40:14.606]  I don't understand.
[02:40:14.646 --> 02:40:16.467]  That was La La Land when I was just hearing.
[02:40:16.687 --> 02:40:17.007]  Yeah.
[02:40:17.548 --> 02:40:20.589]  And this guy says he is a professor.
[02:40:21.489 --> 02:40:23.570]  Well, good luck to the students.
[02:40:25.691 --> 02:40:30.353]  I don't know what sort of... He doesn't know why there's more oil, but it costs more.
[02:40:30.373 --> 02:40:30.973]  Yeah.
[02:40:31.073 --> 02:40:35.995]  But then he says, you know, it's not a scam as they post record profits and say it's about record profits.
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:42.864]  And we have confessions, we have the market, we have the facts, and then he says, uh, I don't know anymore, Michael.
[02:40:42.884 --> 02:40:43.524]  But you're wrong.
[02:40:43.604 --> 02:40:44.324]  He says you're wrong.
[02:40:44.424 --> 02:40:46.366]  So, uh, look.
[02:40:47.186 --> 02:40:49.387]  The markets are telling us what's coming, Alex.
[02:40:50.588 --> 02:40:54.650]  And people, you know, four years ago I told people, get out of these markets.
[02:40:54.731 --> 02:40:56.171]  Not ten years ago.
[02:40:56.912 --> 02:40:57.832]  And everybody laughed.
[02:40:58.032 --> 02:41:05.557]  But today, their 401Ks are down anywhere from 40 to 90, 99, even some are gone completely.
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:07.581]  The market's rebounded.
[02:41:08.442 --> 02:41:11.084]  It's a slight rebound in a bear market.
[02:41:11.504 --> 02:41:16.008]  We are entering into something... Well, if you look at the graph, it's going straight down over the last three years.
[02:41:16.068 --> 02:41:16.488]  Yeah.
[02:41:16.849 --> 02:41:21.372]  Well, and the smart money is moving into gold.
[02:41:21.412 --> 02:41:22.894]  I've never really been a gold bug.
[02:41:23.054 --> 02:41:25.956]  I believe in gold, but I'm not a fanatic about it.
[02:41:26.016 --> 02:41:26.317]  All right.
[02:41:26.397 --> 02:41:27.938]  Michael Hager, thank you so much for coming on.
[02:41:27.958 --> 02:41:29.579]  Next time you're on, I won't keep you on an hour and a half.
[02:41:30.020 --> 02:41:30.400]  All right.
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:31.861]  I really appreciate you coming on.
[02:41:32.161 --> 02:41:34.643]  I'll be back with some final news, tidbits, and key information.

[02:47:29.593 --> 02:47:32.934]  You gotta tell folks the world is round, not flat like the feds say.
[02:47:34.991 --> 02:47:44.934]  1-888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:47:46.695 --> 02:47:49.016]  Al-Qaeda warns of threat to water supply.
[02:47:49.056 --> 02:47:49.896]  Do you really believe that?
[02:47:49.916 --> 02:47:51.557]  When you hear Al-Qaeda, it means CIA.
[02:47:51.677 --> 02:47:53.898]  This is the Washington Times, a spokesman for Al-Qaeda.
[02:47:54.238 --> 02:48:00.780]  It's told in an Arabic-language newspaper that a terror group will try to use poison to attack the United States, specifically threatening to contaminate the nation's water supply.
[02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:02.001]  Anything to control our lives?
[02:48:03.897 --> 02:48:16.812]  Some of the other articles that I have here, many army to protect leaders at G8 Summit, Reuters, France has deployed a small army of 15,000 soldiers, regular police and anti-riot forces to preempt terror attacks and keep the peace at the G8 Summit.
[02:48:17.012 --> 02:48:18.534]  Oh yeah.
[02:48:18.554 --> 02:48:24.180]  Continuing, it's now come out that there were fake reports put out by both governments in England and the U.S., officials
[02:48:25.558 --> 02:48:27.619]  Explodes key weapons of mass destruction claim.
[02:48:28.020 --> 02:48:38.827]  Downing Street dockered a dossier on Iraq's weapons program to make it sexier according to senior British official who claims intelligence services were unhappy with the assertion that Saddam's weapons of mass destruction were ready for use within 45 minutes.
[02:48:40.128 --> 02:48:41.049]  It goes on and on.
[02:48:41.149 --> 02:48:45.171]  The Iraq weapons dossier that was released by the Iraqis, 8,000 pages were taken out.
[02:48:45.231 --> 02:48:46.552]  More info on that being fake.
[02:48:48.093 --> 02:48:51.235]  There's an article here about Ari Fleischer's press conference.
[02:48:51.255 --> 02:48:51.976]  He just did another one.
[02:48:53.661 --> 02:48:53.801]  Wow.
[02:48:53.821 --> 02:48:55.323]  He's just going to drop it.
[02:48:55.363 --> 02:48:55.904]  It's just dropped right.
[02:49:13.923 --> 02:49:17.326]  If you're asking traditional questions, you know the appropriate people to ask.
[02:49:17.346 --> 02:49:20.929]  So, they're not going to go after Clinton for pardoning cocaine dealers and money launderers.
[02:49:21.649 --> 02:49:22.770]  That's your conservatism.
[02:49:22.870 --> 02:49:24.552]  See you back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow.
[02:49:26.913 --> 02:49:33.279]  Ted Pike's monumental new video, Why the Mideast Bleeds, exposes the two main causes of international Arab terrorism.
[02:49:33.359 --> 02:49:36.901]  First, a century of Zionist abuses and atrocity against Palestinians.
