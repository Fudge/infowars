[00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:06.286]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:15.392]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:17.133]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.793 --> 00:00:18.954]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:20.395]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:21.896]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.697 --> 00:00:26.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.982]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.490]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.551]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:47.373]  Another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.177]  It's already the 8th of September, 2003.
[00:00:52.537 --> 00:01:06.883]  Thursday will be the two-year anniversary of 9-1-1, which is the catalyst for the globalists, for PNAC, for the White House, for the New World Order to totally enslave everyone.
[00:01:08.303 --> 00:01:16.347]  And there are now British ministers and officials in this country, many others saying, hey, look at the PNAC documents.
[00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:17.906]  We're good to go.
[00:01:17.926 --> 00:01:18.287]  I think?
[00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:36.630]  I think we're good to go.
[00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.470]  I think we're good to go.
[00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:11.660]  We're also going to have wide open phones on the show and cover a ton of vital news and information.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.320]  Stuff like this.
[00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:13.121]  Here's a headline.
[00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:13.922]  U.S.
[00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:15.943]  out to create global police state.
[00:02:16.864 --> 00:02:17.505]  There's another one.
[00:02:17.545 --> 00:02:27.993]  Bush vows to defeat Iraq resistance and needs another $87 billion and calls the Iraqis terrorists who dare to challenge civilization.
[00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:29.695]  Well, they don't have any civilization.
[00:02:30.558 --> 00:02:35.239]  And the troops are dead and dying, but that's okay, because it's going to expand.
[00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.640]  They're now getting ready with their buddies at the U.N.
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.482]  to go into Iran, saying they've got all these nuclear reactors that can produce all these weapons that our government's Israel and the U.S.
[00:02:45.522 --> 00:02:46.242]  and England sold them.
[00:02:46.622 --> 00:02:48.843]  So now that invasion needs to go ahead and take place.
[00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:53.424]  Also, police now seek DNA record of everyone.
[00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:54.464]  See, it was just for criminals.
[00:02:54.884 --> 00:02:55.984]  Now it's for everyone.
[00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:58.665]  I want to talk about this made-for-TV movie.
[00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:05.767]  Written by a guy who threatened me, Lionel Chetwin, who works for Karl Rove, and taken over the media.
[00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:11.629]  He threatened me about a year and a half ago out filming some episodes of The Conspiracy Zone in L.A.
[00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.570]  He threatened me in the bathroom and said, we're going to get you, Alex Jones.
[00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.753]  Well, now he's made a propaganda film full of lies about George W. Bush that will be airing on national television on September 11th.
[00:03:23.393 --> 00:03:27.635]  And last night I took my wife to another movie to open range, thought it was pretty good.
[00:03:28.655 --> 00:03:30.455]  Kevin Costner, Robert Duvall.
[00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:32.636]  And I almost had to walk out.
[00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:37.157]  I got very angry at the start, not of the movie, but of the ads.
[00:03:37.357 --> 00:03:41.598]  A new show on ABC this fall, Threat Matrix.
[00:03:42.558 --> 00:03:44.618]  They are unstoppable.
[00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:46.739]  No one questions their authority.
[00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.659]  They torture people, and it's good.
[00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:53.120]  Yeah, that was the ad for it.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.261]  And Homeland Security's taking your rights back.
[00:03:57.685 --> 00:03:59.346]  They have a license to kill you.
[00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:00.767]  Torture is good.
[00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:02.468]  The threat matrix is full.
[00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:04.830]  I mean, it's total theater.
[00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.911]  Just like September 11th was theater.
[00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:10.133]  Who they said did it and the things around it, that's theater.
[00:04:10.494 --> 00:04:12.135]  The killing the people was real.
[00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:15.217]  That's theater for the New World Order to totally enslave you.
[00:04:16.418 --> 00:04:20.180]  So we'll go over Lionel Chetwin's new propaganda show about Bush.
[00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:25.684]  Lionel Chetwin, the social promoter of New World Order activities.
[00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:29.290]  Again, he's on the little social end for the propaganda.
[00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:33.512]  That's coming up, and I'll get into Threat Matrix.
[00:04:33.552 --> 00:04:35.893]  I have the review of it here by ABC.
[00:04:36.474 --> 00:04:39.895]  I want to read a quote by Alexander Solzhenitsyn as well.
[00:04:40.536 --> 00:04:50.941]  The big British papers are reporting that, yes, there are giant concentration camps for everyone, but it's for their safety, and they've built them all, and, yes, the attack's coming, and you will have to go to the camps.
[00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:58.554]  We have that here from the BBC City Morning Herald, the Evening Standard, you name it, that's all coming up.
[00:04:58.594 --> 00:05:02.396]  So, a really big broadcast lined up for you.
[00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:07.218]  I sure hope you stay with us and call your friends and family and tell them to tune in.
[00:05:07.258 --> 00:05:08.919]  Right now, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:10.228 --> 00:05:14.575]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:14.755 --> 00:05:19.182]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:19.342 --> 00:05:23.709]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:25.111]  The New World Order.
[00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:31.107]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:38.090]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.310]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:51.034]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:51.234 --> 00:05:52.815]  If you want to understand what the new world order

[00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:17.203]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:07:17.463 --> 00:07:20.287]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:20.627]  I think.

[00:08:14.883 --> 00:08:15.544]  Big Brother.
[00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.245]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:19.066]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.727 --> 00:08:20.547]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.308 --> 00:08:22.208]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.228 --> 00:08:26.652]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.052 --> 00:08:31.175]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:42.223]  All right, my friends, I'm down here in Austin, Texas, and I'm hooked in with the great folks up in the mothership,
[00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:47.025]  In Minnesota, Vince is running the broadcast today.
[00:08:47.045 --> 00:08:56.874]  I was telling him that when he calls Congressman Ron Paul today in the third hour to get him on the show, he's got to call him Your Excellency.
[00:08:58.135 --> 00:09:00.898]  Because we're shifting over to the UN system.
[00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:06.003]  And have you ever watched on C-SPAN how Colin Powell or President Bush or Bill Clinton...
[00:09:06.701 --> 00:09:07.802]  I think we're good to go.
[00:09:30.245 --> 00:09:30.725]  We're good to go.
[00:09:30.745 --> 00:09:31.066]  I think?
[00:09:45.074 --> 00:09:47.896]  And now the conservative court is all for it.
[00:09:47.956 --> 00:09:49.817]  So we're going to have Ron Paul on.
[00:09:49.877 --> 00:09:51.799]  Congressman is excellent.
[00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:53.080]  Of course, he wouldn't want to be called that.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.661]  The Honorable Ron Paul has been on the show many times.
[00:09:55.701 --> 00:09:56.742]  I don't know, 20-something times.
[00:09:57.342 --> 00:10:03.707]  In the third hour, to talk about the greatest threat to America, the Trotskyite neocons, Bush and the communist controllers.
[00:10:04.627 --> 00:10:05.928]  Oh, you'll hear Ron Paul on the show.
[00:10:06.849 --> 00:10:09.791]  Coming up on the broadcast today.
[00:10:11.824 --> 00:10:13.105]  So you do not want to miss that.
[00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:23.511]  How they talk about how they want to use terror to control of our lives and all the rest of this with the neocon analysis in the third hour.
[00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:32.155]  Of course, this is a guy with an actual conservative voting record, the most conservative pro-America voting record in Congress in the last 50 years or so.
[00:10:34.196 --> 00:10:35.437]  And you might want to tune into it.
[00:10:35.697 --> 00:10:37.038]  I want to warn you, he's pro-gun.
[00:10:37.398 --> 00:10:38.719]  He's actually anti-abortion.
[00:10:39.635 --> 00:10:42.016]  He is for sovereignty and controlling our borders.
[00:10:42.236 --> 00:10:49.478]  I just want to warn you, some of you neocon listeners who have been listening to Hannity and Limbaugh will think you're listening to a communist.
[00:10:49.818 --> 00:10:54.420]  Actually, you're the communist, literally, literally, and we are the conservatives.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.520]  So I want to warn you, this could shock you.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.301]  We're not for gun control here.
[00:10:58.541 --> 00:11:00.161]  And again, it sounds sarcastic to some.
[00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:02.102]  I'm not being sarcastic, okay?
[00:11:03.702 --> 00:11:07.343]  I've been called a liberal because I'm 100% behind the Second Amendment, okay?
[00:11:07.824 --> 00:11:09.064]  But that's coming up the third hour.
[00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:12.823]  In the meantime, I'm going to try to calm myself down.
[00:11:12.843 --> 00:11:15.024]  I'm really wound up today.
[00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:19.127]  Tonight, this morning, depending on what time zone you're listening to us in.
[00:11:19.708 --> 00:11:20.708]  I'm wound up right now.
[00:11:22.289 --> 00:11:26.852]  There is no way to properly cover everything we're facing, everything we're dealing with.
[00:11:26.932 --> 00:11:27.433]  But you know what?
[00:11:27.513 --> 00:11:28.013]  I'm going to do it.
[00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:33.657]  In fact, I'm not going to take calls today until I've had time to cover the entire stack that's here in front of me.
[00:11:33.677 --> 00:11:34.237]  So you know what?
[00:11:34.998 --> 00:11:36.899]  There may not be any calls today, folks.
[00:11:38.476 --> 00:11:40.158]  I got a sneaking suspicion, though.
[00:11:40.978 --> 00:11:42.560]  If I focus, I can do it.
[00:11:43.941 --> 00:11:45.402]  And so let's go ahead and try it.
[00:11:45.422 --> 00:11:47.785]  And I can probably be done before this hour is over.
[00:11:48.425 --> 00:11:50.587]  And with a lot of the key stuff, I'm going to give you some calls.
[00:11:53.149 --> 00:12:00.936]  Now, this is what Alexander Solzhenitsyn had to say about Russia and the oppression there.
[00:12:00.976 --> 00:12:02.758]  He wrote, Gulag Archipelago.
[00:12:03.959 --> 00:12:04.700]  Archipelago.
[00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:10.513]  About the thousands of camps, the economy, the prison economy in Russia.
[00:12:10.573 --> 00:12:13.916]  And then he came here in the 80s and found out that the same people ran America.
[00:12:14.236 --> 00:12:15.257]  He left in disgust.
[00:12:15.277 --> 00:12:15.757]  Did you know that?
[00:12:15.837 --> 00:12:17.198]  He's since written other books about that.
[00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:21.422]  And now the same thing is happening here.
[00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:24.104]  So I just want to read this, because we're about the information war.
[00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:27.607]  We're about trying to fix things peacefully, waking up as many people as possible.
[00:12:27.988 --> 00:12:33.953]  That will stop the globalists from going into the deeper and darker phases of despotism that they want to activate.
[00:12:35.563 --> 00:12:37.524]  But let me go ahead and read this now.
[00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:39.385]  Emphasis added.
[00:12:41.366 --> 00:13:00.455]  This is Solzhenitsyn, and I quote, And how we burned in the camps later, thinking what would things have been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family.
[00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:28.682]  Or if during periods of mass arrest, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, hailing in terror at every bang on the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had, at every bang at the staircase, understood that they had nothing left to lose...
[00:13:29.466 --> 00:13:32.088]  Oh, yes.
[00:13:32.408 --> 00:13:38.333]  Ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, whatever they had at hand.
[00:13:48.149 --> 00:14:00.092]  The organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport, and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt.
[00:14:00.612 --> 00:14:02.853]  Gulag Archipelago Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
[00:14:02.893 --> 00:14:05.393]  Let me read that again.
[00:14:05.413 --> 00:14:10.775]  Again, I'm not a $7.5 million a year paid newsreader, so bear with me, folks.
[00:14:12.075 --> 00:14:14.256]  And how we burned in the camps later, thinking...
[00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:24.032]  What things have been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive?
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.902]  And had to say goodbye to his family.
[00:14:27.182 --> 00:14:53.503]  Or during periods of mass arrest, as example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, hailing in terror at every bang on the downstairs door and every step on the staircase, but had understood that they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else they had at hand.
[00:14:54.631 --> 00:15:10.797]  The organs, again, of the state, the organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers in transport, and the organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers in transport, and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt.
[00:15:11.538 --> 00:15:15.099]  Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Gulag Archipelago.
[00:15:17.302 --> 00:15:20.445]  Now, make no mistake, they're trying to condition you that all this is good.
[00:15:20.885 --> 00:15:29.151]  I mean, the Russian death squads right up into the 90s wore black ski masks, black helmets, black uniforms.
[00:15:29.572 --> 00:15:30.853]  They still do today.
[00:15:32.314 --> 00:15:34.015]  Stalin had this going on 50, 60 years ago.
[00:15:36.164 --> 00:15:39.147]  Hitler had people near the end wearing black masks.
[00:15:39.187 --> 00:15:43.050]  The executioners a thousand years ago wore black masks.
[00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.633]  The inquisitioners on their tribunals wore black masks.
[00:15:46.953 --> 00:15:51.557]  When your government starts wearing black masks, let me just give you a 101.
[00:15:51.777 --> 00:15:53.599]  You're in serious trouble, folks.
[00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:59.730]  And I don't care what sick mind-control excuse they've got.
[00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.891]  It's to protect my face from glass.
[00:16:01.931 --> 00:16:02.971]  Yeah, when you're busting in windows.
[00:16:03.312 --> 00:16:04.552]  No, it's for intimidation.
[00:16:04.712 --> 00:16:06.973]  And so nobody knows who you are because I've seen you.
[00:16:07.113 --> 00:16:11.375]  You take your badges off or cover up your badge number with tape.
[00:16:11.915 --> 00:16:14.496]  And I don't want to hear it's to protect you because of the criminals.
[00:16:14.816 --> 00:16:17.377]  You are the criminals when you cover your faces up.
[00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:24.812]  The more police state, the more black ski masks we get, the more crime we've got, the bigger the prisons, the more drugs on our streets.
[00:16:24.832 --> 00:16:27.094]  So stop acting like you're doing us a favor.
[00:16:27.114 --> 00:16:27.595]  You're not.
[00:16:27.615 --> 00:16:40.747]  I don't want to get off on a two-hour long babble, but this is on InfoWars.com in our concentration camp section.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.321]  We've got a concentration camp section, this Alexander Solzhenitsyn quote, also on prisonplanet.com.
[00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:52.362]  You want to read Rocky Mountain News, Associated Press, Newsmax, LA Times.
[00:16:52.382 --> 00:16:59.924]  You want to read about giant camps for you and your family with incinerators and mass graves ready, you better go look at it.
[00:17:02.524 --> 00:17:04.505]  No, we're not going to talk about UT football.
[00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:07.005]  We're not going to talk about Notre Dame football.
[00:17:07.045 --> 00:17:08.225]  We're not going to do it.
[00:17:09.226 --> 00:17:11.066]  I mean, it's a religion all weekend.
[00:17:12.516 --> 00:17:17.279]  I was eating breakfast this morning about 7 in the morning in a little cafe by myself reading the newspaper.
[00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:19.261]  I had to do some errands.
[00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:21.142]  I had to wait until the stores opened.
[00:17:23.055 --> 00:17:30.522]  There's people in there, and they're talking about, yeah, the gas just keeps going up, but it shouldn't be going up because we've got more fuel than ever, but it doesn't matter.
[00:17:30.562 --> 00:17:33.284]  Let's talk about UT football or Dallas Cowboys.
[00:17:33.304 --> 00:17:39.850]  And I hear people, they talk about something serious and then automatically shift tables all around me into, well, that's all right.
[00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:40.731]  Let's talk about this.
[00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:44.274]  I mean, I was watching the escapism happening there in front of me.
[00:17:45.222 --> 00:17:47.024]  How about you talk a little less about football?
[00:17:47.264 --> 00:17:48.885]  Now they're putting cameras up in the schools.
[00:17:49.326 --> 00:17:54.230]  How about you talk a little less about football, about how the border's wide open, but they're telling you you've got to give up your liberty?
[00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:56.672]  That's all I'm trying to say.
[00:17:59.674 --> 00:18:01.616]  Now, here's some of the news we're going to get to when we get back.
[00:18:01.776 --> 00:18:02.076]  U.S.
[00:18:02.237 --> 00:18:03.598]  out to create global police state.
[00:18:03.638 --> 00:18:04.218]  Nice headline.
[00:18:04.498 --> 00:18:06.080]  Bush vows to defeat Iraqi resistance.
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.302]  He's 87 billion more to do it.
[00:18:08.362 --> 00:18:11.945]  Now anyone that fights over there is a terrorist, and this is the war on terror.
[00:18:13.846 --> 00:18:14.587]  And they want the U.N.
[00:18:14.607 --> 00:18:16.368]  to come in, of course, which they were going to do all along.
[00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:17.689]  This is more good cop, bad cop.
[00:18:17.769 --> 00:18:20.091]  Also, police seek DNA record of everyone.
[00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:22.072]  See, it started out for just some.
[00:18:22.132 --> 00:18:23.774]  Now it's everyone.
[00:18:24.714 --> 00:18:25.395]  We'll get to that.
[00:18:27.076 --> 00:18:31.199]  Bush takes center stage in 9-1-1 drama written by Lionel Chetwin.
[00:18:31.239 --> 00:18:41.567]  Lionel Chetwin, the big Hollywood producer, who threatened me when I was out in L.A., walked in the bathroom there at the set of, I don't know, whatever the big network was, TNN,
[00:18:43.208 --> 00:18:44.368]  It's owned by some bigger network.
[00:18:44.408 --> 00:18:45.749]  Walked in the bathroom and threatened me.
[00:18:45.769 --> 00:18:47.209]  We're going to get you, Alex Jones.
[00:18:47.229 --> 00:18:50.650]  Well, he's made a new film about how Bush had to be restrained.
[00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:51.551]  He was so angry.
[00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:55.812]  I want to have a fist fight with Saddam right now.
[00:18:55.872 --> 00:19:00.053]  We've been lying on Air Force One when he found out about the attacks.
[00:19:00.253 --> 00:19:01.494]  Yeah, right, folks.
[00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:11.657]  And also, last night I went to see Open Range, and they had an ad before it for the threat matrix about Homeland Security using the real-term threat matrix.
[00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:15.226]  And that torture's good in the show.
[00:19:15.266 --> 00:19:16.727]  The show's all about torturing people.
[00:19:16.767 --> 00:19:22.569]  There's a shot of a guy naked, strapped down, being tortured, and this woman standing there going, Answer my questions!
[00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.190]  And she's the good guy.
[00:19:25.251 --> 00:19:27.512]  So remember, our guys that got tortured in Vietnam?
[00:19:28.572 --> 00:19:29.813]  Viet Cong were good.
[00:19:30.013 --> 00:19:33.795]  The Vietnamese regulars in the North were good people.
[00:19:34.735 --> 00:19:36.256]  Torture's good.
[00:19:37.036 --> 00:19:38.657]  Those that are against it are bad.
[00:19:39.406 --> 00:19:40.527]  Threat Matrix is full.
[00:19:41.067 --> 00:19:42.888]  Their power is unlimited.
[00:19:43.629 --> 00:19:45.510]  No one questions their authority.
[00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.812]  They have unorthodox ways of making people talk.
[00:19:48.832 --> 00:19:50.633]  And it shows the Necadabian fortune.
[00:19:52.374 --> 00:19:54.515]  Answer my questions!
[00:19:54.995 --> 00:19:58.898]  They protect America with a grid of satellites watching everything you do.
[00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.880]  The Threat Matrix is full on ABC.
[00:20:03.283 --> 00:20:04.864]  Destroying America!
[00:20:04.924 --> 00:20:06.825]  Preparing you for the death camps!
[00:20:06.845 --> 00:20:08.125]  Ha ha ha!

[00:21:15.617 --> 00:21:19.719]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:19.999 --> 00:21:20.559]  We listened.
[00:21:20.859 --> 00:21:25.842]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:26.122 --> 00:21:26.602]  We listened.
[00:21:26.983 --> 00:21:30.024]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:30.464 --> 00:21:30.985]  We listened.
[00:21:31.465 --> 00:21:35.247]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:21:35.247 --> 00:21:35.908]  We're good to go.

[00:22:02.353 --> 00:22:03.918]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:09.606 --> 00:22:12.749]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[00:22:13.209 --> 00:22:15.211]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[00:22:15.571 --> 00:22:18.173]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:23.077]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[00:22:23.297 --> 00:22:25.059]  But you have to act now.
[00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:31.464]  We have $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I have seen in my 24 years in the business.
[00:22:31.844 --> 00:22:38.387]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:45.851]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk, or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[00:22:46.271 --> 00:22:48.532]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[00:22:48.912 --> 00:22:49.732]  Do it now.
[00:22:49.993 --> 00:22:58.136]  That's $10 collector gold coins, $10 and $20 collector gold coins, at the nearest of melt in my 24 years in this business.
[00:22:58.216 --> 00:22:59.337]  Call Midas Resources.
[00:22:59.701 --> 00:22:59.981]  800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.001 --> 00:23:04.544]  That's Midas at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:05.404 --> 00:23:10.788]  I've lost 10 pounds with the collagen aid so far.
[00:23:11.008 --> 00:23:11.708]  Give it a try.
[00:23:11.908 --> 00:23:12.689]  Worked good for me.
[00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:16.231]  I'm going to have to go get re-measured because my pants are getting kind of baggy on me.
[00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:17.832]  My stomach is not there no more.
[00:23:17.852 --> 00:23:18.873]  It's really very easy.
[00:23:19.073 --> 00:23:21.634]  Helps me sleep good, lose weight, tones me up.
[00:23:21.934 --> 00:23:22.535]  Hey, I like it.
[00:23:22.895 --> 00:23:29.499]  Trying to lose weight for someone in a wheelchair is extremely frustrating, and the first month that I tried it, I lost 6 pounds.
[00:23:29.779 --> 00:23:30.720]  What are you waiting for?

[00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:19.752]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:20.212 --> 00:24:30.195]  All right, folks, we're back live, and I've got a bunch of different news items here that we're about to go over.
[00:24:30.675 --> 00:24:34.276]  Why did I read that Alexander Solzhenitsyn story about the camps?
[00:24:36.235 --> 00:24:40.218]  Well, you don't think they're just going to come out and say we're going to put you all in concentration camps.
[00:24:40.938 --> 00:24:46.022]  No, they actually call them rest and relocation centers.
[00:24:47.143 --> 00:24:50.445]  Yes, they're rest centers for you.
[00:24:51.698 --> 00:24:52.259]  In the country...
[00:25:16.665 --> 00:25:26.334]  And raise the possibility of rehousing the displaced for a minimum or long term if an attack renders an area uninhabitable.
[00:25:27.735 --> 00:25:37.844]  Now, they had a nice drill with foot and mouth, which Scott Television News and the Sunday Express reported was released by Porton Down Bioweapons Lab that Dr. David Kelly just so happened to head.
[00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:39.706]  He's had a little boo-boo now.
[00:25:40.666 --> 00:25:42.168]  And it's admitted the guy was killed.
[00:25:42.628 --> 00:25:43.449]  That's been coming out.
[00:25:44.728 --> 00:25:46.649]  So we have all of that.
[00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:53.211]  They released the foot and mouth, and I predicted they wouldn't let people restock cows or sheep, and they did exactly that to force them off their land.
[00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:55.592]  They killed 8 million sheep, 4 million cows.
[00:25:55.632 --> 00:25:57.712]  Only a few hundred actually had foot and mouth.
[00:25:57.752 --> 00:26:01.253]  It showed up in dozens of places, hundreds of miles apart on the same day.
[00:26:01.273 --> 00:26:08.736]  And it turned out the government had launched the attack quietly, calmly in the back of the paper that, oh yeah, it came missing from our level 4 bioweapons lab.
[00:26:09.562 --> 00:26:11.803]  That's okay, because I've got other articles here.
[00:26:11.863 --> 00:26:14.464]  The British government says they will be attacked.
[00:26:14.584 --> 00:26:15.625]  It's going to happen.
[00:26:15.685 --> 00:26:16.865]  It's going to be massive.
[00:26:17.425 --> 00:26:18.326]  It's going to be bigger.
[00:26:18.706 --> 00:26:27.109]  It's going to be biological or chemical, and they're going to have to arrest people, thousands of them, and there's going to be secret arrests, and anybody that doesn't submit is going to be shot on sight.
[00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.330]  They've said that in our papers, too.
[00:26:31.091 --> 00:26:36.253]  And the head of FEMA up in New Jersey said that during a red alert, you're an enemy and you leave your home.
[00:26:37.401 --> 00:26:44.724]  They include herding Londoners, this is the article, into rest and reception areas in the country.
[00:26:46.385 --> 00:26:52.627]  The head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir John Stevens, last week warned that a terrorist attack on Britain was inevitable.
[00:26:54.153 --> 00:27:02.199]  Yesterday, emergency services evacuated an underground station as part of a full-scale exercise to see how London would cope with a chemical attack.
[00:27:02.699 --> 00:27:05.081]  And they've done all these fake bio-attacks in Austin.
[00:27:05.141 --> 00:27:06.882]  I mean, I've been through dozens of them.
[00:27:07.322 --> 00:27:16.729]  They'll shut down downtown, shut down hospitals, announce we've been hit for 10 hours, and then quietly at about midnight, it was just a drill, just a drill, just a drill.
[00:27:17.748 --> 00:27:29.473]  Well, yeah, we went down and shot video of it a few years ago, and they're laughing and patting the guy on the back, the supposed Muslim that they stopped with the Koran on the back of the car, and they said he may have biological weapons.
[00:27:29.513 --> 00:27:32.935]  The cops opened the trunk, collapsed and passed out, and, oh, we've been hit.
[00:27:33.195 --> 00:27:34.516]  This is in 2000, by the way.
[00:27:34.996 --> 00:27:42.399]  We go down with a high-power video camera lens, I don't know, like a 50 zoom or something, zoom in, they're laughing, slap on the back.
[00:27:42.419 --> 00:27:45.681]  He's got a short haircut, got the whole cop lingo.
[00:27:46.818 --> 00:27:47.918]  Later, another car pulls up.
[00:27:47.958 --> 00:27:50.379]  He gets in his own black sedan and drives off.
[00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:50.900]  He's a cop.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.681]  Now, they never even admitted that was fake until like a month later, just quietly in the paper.
[00:27:55.921 --> 00:27:57.462]  Yeah, those were some drills.
[00:27:58.382 --> 00:28:08.046]  Again, fake terror, telling you it's real, fake nuclear attacks, shutting down the highway, and then later announcing, sometimes that day, sometimes a week later, sometimes a month later.
[00:28:08.426 --> 00:28:11.507]  One time I had to jump in front of the news cameras and yell, it's fake, it's fake.
[00:28:12.358 --> 00:28:16.183]  Then I called local ABC channel and I said, you know it's fake, you better report it right now.
[00:28:16.223 --> 00:28:16.623]  They did.
[00:28:16.643 --> 00:28:18.405]  They went on the air and said, yes, this was fake.
[00:28:18.425 --> 00:28:20.328]  We're going to go ahead and tell you now.
[00:28:21.749 --> 00:28:25.514]  That's when they shut down the whole DPS building and shipped everybody to the hospital.
[00:28:27.446 --> 00:28:29.248]  You talk about control, folks.
[00:28:29.288 --> 00:28:29.949]  They're doing it.
[00:28:30.449 --> 00:28:31.810]  And this is what they want to do.
[00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:32.871]  They want to train you.
[00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:36.895]  They can shut down cities, arrest whoever they want, and, oh, it's just a quarantine.
[00:28:37.236 --> 00:28:38.156]  Oh, it's just a drill.
[00:28:38.277 --> 00:28:39.598]  Oh, it's just a stop terrorist.
[00:28:39.958 --> 00:28:40.799]  Oh, it's a red alert.
[00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:41.800]  You can't leave your home.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.221]  Think about that.
[00:28:44.382 --> 00:28:46.905]  London could be evacuated if attacked.
[00:28:48.172 --> 00:28:54.878]  Blair government reportedly has secret plans to evacuate London and other big cities in the event of a terrorist strike or threat.
[00:28:55.218 --> 00:29:09.670]  They include herding Londoners into rest and reception areas in the country and raise the possibility of rehousing the displaced for a minimum or long term when the attack runs an area uninhabitable.
[00:29:10.876 --> 00:29:12.677]  And, of course, you'll have to work in the camps.
[00:29:12.697 --> 00:29:14.898]  There'll have to be production and growing of food.
[00:29:15.259 --> 00:29:16.459]  The government said all this.
[00:29:16.999 --> 00:29:19.521]  Whole societies, you know, reorganize.
[00:29:19.561 --> 00:29:21.462]  And, of course, we'll never really get out of the camps.
[00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:25.824]  But, you know, it's the fight against Al-Qaeda, and there'll be a national draft.
[00:29:25.884 --> 00:29:28.506]  And they say you're going to have to serve domestically here in the U.S.
[00:29:28.546 --> 00:29:30.447]  and England and Canada and Australia and New Zealand.
[00:29:30.887 --> 00:29:37.431]  You'll have to serve domestically digging ditches and working in factories because the government's providing food in your bunk at the camps.
[00:29:38.351 --> 00:29:39.852]  And so, of course, you're going to have to work.
[00:29:39.872 --> 00:29:41.232]  They're going to do it.
[00:29:41.252 --> 00:29:45.854]  They're going to have lots of made-for-TV movies praising the great leader, the dear leader.
[00:29:46.754 --> 00:29:49.075]  And we'll thank the government for all they do.
[00:29:50.035 --> 00:29:52.076]  People that work hard will be able to leave the camp.
[00:29:52.656 --> 00:29:53.796]  There will be security risks.
[00:29:53.816 --> 00:29:55.017]  You know, terrorists will be attacking.
[00:29:55.057 --> 00:29:58.318]  There will be some arrests, detentions, and interrogations in the camp.
[00:30:00.819 --> 00:30:01.739]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.199 --> 00:30:03.820]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.421]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.916 --> 00:30:13.518]  Hardly a day goes by in the garden without the Cobra Head.
[00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:16.560]  I want to tell you about a great little garden tool called the Cobra Head.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:24.985]  First, take half of the tools you're currently using in the garden, throw them away, and call 1-8- Super powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:25.025 --> 00:30:25.206]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:30:50.661 --> 00:30:53.803]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[00:30:54.083 --> 00:30:59.607]  And in this month's U.S.
[00:30:59.687 --> 00:31:04.310]  News & World Reporter, this week, the September 8th issue, you know, I talked a lot about that.
[00:31:05.491 --> 00:31:08.933]  Last Friday, it says, your cell phone is watching you.
[00:31:09.013 --> 00:31:15.078]  And you open the magazine up, and it says, yeah, there's RFID chips going on the products, going to track you for your safety.
[00:31:15.338 --> 00:31:18.200]  Yeah, there's satellite plug-in boxes on all the new cars.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.641]  We're about to start taxing you.
[00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.591]  Yeah, we're cameras.
[00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:23.432]  We're watching you.
[00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:26.513]  The article really expands out into many other wonderful subjects.
[00:31:26.593 --> 00:31:28.374]  Just, folks, come on.
[00:31:28.534 --> 00:31:29.535]  That's 1984.
[00:31:29.655 --> 00:31:34.917]  I've got articles here where they're announcing that they're going to take all our DNA now.
[00:31:35.097 --> 00:31:35.778]  Well, guess what?
[00:31:36.178 --> 00:31:40.420]  When they announce it, they've already been doing it for at least 30-plus years.
[00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:44.672]  They have been taking newborn babies' blood and sending it to a federal database.
[00:31:45.092 --> 00:31:46.233]  And they do it in Australia.
[00:31:46.273 --> 00:31:46.933]  They do it in England.
[00:31:46.953 --> 00:31:47.834]  They do it in the U.S.
[00:31:48.294 --> 00:31:49.595]  I've had congressmen on about it.
[00:31:49.635 --> 00:31:50.836]  I've read the news articles.
[00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:54.059]  The average bozo, though, has no idea.
[00:31:54.239 --> 00:32:01.444]  Folks, we've got a premeditated government that takes blood 30-something, 33 years before and then announces it.
[00:32:02.987 --> 00:32:11.793]  Later, it says, oh, since the war on terror, it just so happens we have all these samples kept in freeze-dried areas, and we're now going to use it.
[00:32:11.833 --> 00:32:12.833]  Ha, ha, ha!
[00:32:13.874 --> 00:32:20.498]  It just so happens that years ago we put satellite tracker plug-ins in all your cars, and now worldwide we're about to start taxing you.
[00:32:20.518 --> 00:32:24.040]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.641]  You realize how horrible this is?
[00:32:25.741 --> 00:32:26.762]  I love this country.
[00:32:27.763 --> 00:32:28.823]  I was burning mad.
[00:32:29.284 --> 00:32:30.284]  I've got to tell the story right now.
[00:32:30.304 --> 00:32:31.085]  I'll get back into the news.
[00:32:32.302 --> 00:32:33.463]  Because these really illustrate it.
[00:32:34.123 --> 00:32:36.244]  I watch no more than about an hour of TV a week.
[00:32:36.464 --> 00:32:37.345]  I should watch it.
[00:32:37.485 --> 00:32:38.325]  I can't help it.
[00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:44.308]  I just hate television and the propaganda so much that I can read the text of what they said.
[00:32:44.328 --> 00:32:46.249]  I don't get as disturbed and angry.
[00:32:46.289 --> 00:33:01.777]  But if it's some smiling info babe in a $2,000 suit laughing at me or some lying Peter Jennings or Tom Brokaw or somebody or Bill O'Reilly telling me how good cameras in the classrooms are, I just can't stand it, okay?
[00:33:02.765 --> 00:33:07.448]  I can't watch the societal Ted Bundys of the world.
[00:33:07.468 --> 00:33:11.490]  That's what they are, the purveyors of cultural death and evil.
[00:33:12.271 --> 00:33:13.692]  I can't watch them anymore.
[00:33:13.772 --> 00:33:14.492]  Just forgive me.
[00:33:15.253 --> 00:33:15.693]  I'm begging you.
[00:33:15.713 --> 00:33:26.420]  If you see something special on TV or something I need, mail it to me, and I'll review it for a film with a bucket basket nearby, a puke basket.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.722]  I mean, really, folks, I am so happy not watching TV.
[00:33:29.762 --> 00:33:30.162]  It's wonderful.
[00:33:31.306 --> 00:33:35.369]  My wife says to me last Friday, she goes, we haven't been to a movie in months, and we've always been moviegoers.
[00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.532]  I go, all right, let's go see some escapism, Pirates of the Caribbean.
[00:33:39.552 --> 00:33:44.636]  We went and saw that, and it had some propaganda a little bit in it, but not much.
[00:33:44.656 --> 00:33:45.477]  It was a pretty good movie.
[00:33:47.038 --> 00:33:48.079]  And she goes, man, that was good.
[00:33:48.119 --> 00:33:48.979]  Let's go see another one.
[00:33:48.999 --> 00:33:50.861]  I go, all right, let's go see On the Range.
[00:33:50.901 --> 00:33:52.082]  I like Kevin Costner.
[00:33:53.022 --> 00:33:56.064]  It looks like I like Robert Duvall, probably a half-decent film.
[00:33:56.685 --> 00:33:57.365]  Let's go see it.
[00:33:57.385 --> 00:34:00.588]  Well, it was a good movie, but I was not spared, folks.
[00:34:02.228 --> 00:34:07.815]  Because they had an ad for the new ABC show, Threat Matrix.
[00:34:08.435 --> 00:34:14.382]  And it's the big, powerful voiceover guy comes in and goes, The power is unlimited.
[00:34:14.883 --> 00:34:16.204]  Directly from the president.
[00:34:17.726 --> 00:34:19.989]  Their activities are unquestioned.
[00:34:20.249 --> 00:34:22.331]  They act outside everyone.
[00:34:24.088 --> 00:34:28.271]  And it said something like, their means of getting people to talk are unorthodox.
[00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:38.297]  And it shows a guy with lacerations, bruises all over him, strapped down, head shaved, electrodes all hooked to him, going, blah!
[00:34:39.778 --> 00:34:46.403]  And it cuts to this well-meaning, loving, torture woman, and she's going, answer my question!
[00:34:47.512 --> 00:34:51.073]  And I saw people in the crowd just kind of smiling with satisfaction.
[00:34:51.374 --> 00:34:52.494]  It was a full theater.
[00:34:52.574 --> 00:34:53.634]  I looked to my left, my right.
[00:34:53.695 --> 00:34:55.155]  I saw people sitting there.
[00:34:55.175 --> 00:34:58.016]  You know they got power pride stickers on their cars.
[00:34:58.296 --> 00:35:03.098]  They're feeling real good about George W. right now.
[00:35:03.659 --> 00:35:05.939]  And I had to sit there, and I saw them smiling.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.440]  I looked over during the torture scene, and they were smiling.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.061]  I mean, we're a sick culture, folks.
[00:35:13.381 --> 00:35:21.407]  I was watching Mass Condition went on and on about how they're unlimited power, how they take your rights for your safety, how torture's good.
[00:35:21.947 --> 00:35:23.388]  See, it's hard to escape.
[00:35:23.728 --> 00:35:24.629]  And so, that's it.
[00:35:25.229 --> 00:35:26.911]  I haven't been in the movies in over a month.
[00:35:27.171 --> 00:35:28.371]  Now I went twice this weekend.
[00:35:28.672 --> 00:35:29.832]  I'm not going for six months.
[00:35:30.573 --> 00:35:31.013]  That's it.
[00:35:31.193 --> 00:35:34.876]  I'll order stuff by DVD or by VHS.
[00:35:35.036 --> 00:35:35.897]  I will not go.
[00:35:35.917 --> 00:35:39.399]  I will not sit there and watch this trash anymore.
[00:35:41.707 --> 00:35:47.010]  But, you know, I guess I should because at least I'm really... I mean, my heart started beating.
[00:35:47.030 --> 00:36:01.798]  I started getting angry because I was watching a military industrial complex production telling me it was going to enslave my family and that preparing the mass for torture and secret arrest and secret police, I was watching it.
[00:36:02.618 --> 00:36:04.199]  You know how threatening that was?
[00:36:05.359 --> 00:36:06.600]  And again, I'm going to read it again.
[00:36:07.901 --> 00:36:10.002]  Alexander Schultz needs a gulag archipelago.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:22.192]  And how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return alive.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:47.579]  And had to say goodbye to his family, or if during periods of mass arrest, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, hauling, hailing in terror at every bang on the downstairs door and every step on the staircase, but had understood that they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up
[00:36:48.019 --> 00:36:55.380]  In the downstairs hall, an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.581]  That's right.
[00:36:59.321 --> 00:37:09.763]  The organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers in transport, and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt.
[00:37:10.984 --> 00:37:13.184]  Now, that's an act of terrorism today, folks.
[00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:24.600]  I mean, they say you will submit to secret arrest, you will submit to secret execution, one marijuana cigarette listed in the new Victory Act, secret arrest, life in prison, secret execution.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.481]  That's what it says, folks.
[00:37:27.282 --> 00:37:27.822]  Go read it.
[00:37:27.882 --> 00:37:33.707]  Go read the definition of terrorism, what you can be punished for, and then they list one marijuana cigarette as an act of terror.
[00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:36.450]  You're thinking, they'll never do that.
[00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:40.693]  Oh, yeah, they take little old ladies' houses all the time with no drugs found, folks.
[00:37:41.174 --> 00:37:42.635]  They take the money out of their purses.
[00:37:43.877 --> 00:37:49.459]  They pull over good old boys, driving down to buy a truckload of produce.
[00:37:49.519 --> 00:37:50.419]  They take his money.
[00:37:50.799 --> 00:37:52.239]  They do it all the time.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.400]  Am I saying all the cops shake people down?
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.821]  Am I saying all of them are criminals?
[00:37:56.901 --> 00:37:58.721]  No, but most of the bosses are.
[00:37:59.021 --> 00:38:01.842]  Most of the big city police are CIA.
[00:38:02.382 --> 00:38:03.462]  That's mainstream news.
[00:38:03.983 --> 00:38:05.663]  And who's going to watch the watchers?
[00:38:06.103 --> 00:38:12.345]  You see, throughout history, the greatest abuse has come from those that are in power, from those that are positions of control.
[00:38:13.385 --> 00:38:14.846]  That's the point here, folks.
[00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:30.457]  And how we burned in the camps later, thinking what would things have been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain of whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family.
[00:38:30.898 --> 00:38:40.545]  Or during periods of mass arrest, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs...
[00:38:42.023 --> 00:39:00.029]  Hailing and tear at every bang on the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase that understood that they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up ambushes of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, whatever else was at hand.
[00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:07.552]  The organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and would have ground to a halt, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst.
[00:39:08.192 --> 00:39:10.073]  The curse machine would have ground to a halt.
[00:39:11.385 --> 00:39:12.506]  That's all on InfoWars.com.
[00:39:12.546 --> 00:39:13.848]  You know what I want you to do?
[00:39:13.868 --> 00:39:16.010]  I want you to go to our concentration camp section.
[00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:19.473]  I want you to go to the Prison Planet concentration camp section.
[00:39:19.694 --> 00:39:22.456]  I want you to grab those dozens of mainstream articles, L.A.
[00:39:22.517 --> 00:39:28.663]  Times, Rocky Mountain News, Newsmax, Associated Press, and I want you to put all those links.
[00:39:30.098 --> 00:39:30.478]  On there.
[00:39:30.698 --> 00:39:33.279]  And I want you to put Solzhenitsyn's quote at the top.
[00:39:33.339 --> 00:39:38.741]  And I want you to email that to every news agency and every radio talk show host in your area.
[00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:40.542]  And I want you to email it to them.
[00:39:40.762 --> 00:39:43.203]  And I want you to tell them, time to wake up.
[00:39:43.343 --> 00:39:45.003]  Time to stop rationalizing.
[00:39:45.323 --> 00:39:46.744]  Time to read these articles.
[00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:51.906]  Folks, I got a Rocky Mountain News article where the governor admits they got incinerators in mass graves.
[00:39:52.686 --> 00:39:53.786]  Incinerators?
[00:39:54.787 --> 00:39:58.848]  They've hired the former head of the KGB, Primakov.
[00:39:59.369 --> 00:40:00.230]  Associated Press.
[00:40:01.171 --> 00:40:04.774]  To run Homeland Security Internal Passport.
[00:40:05.654 --> 00:40:07.536]  Folks, that's been on the news.
[00:40:08.797 --> 00:40:13.301]  I mean, how am I supposed to sit here normal when I can't take my wife to see a Western?
[00:40:13.801 --> 00:40:17.604]  I go to it and there's an ad where some woman's torturing somebody to death.
[00:40:17.844 --> 00:40:18.965]  And they're the good guys.
[00:40:20.607 --> 00:40:22.408]  Joseph Mingler wasn't good, folks.
[00:40:23.689 --> 00:40:25.671]  No, he came from a wealthy German family.
[00:40:26.388 --> 00:40:29.569]  And he said, I'll do whatever it takes for the Reich to advance medicine.
[00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.890]  And he turned into a literal demon.
[00:40:32.951 --> 00:40:33.611]  I will say it.
[00:40:33.691 --> 00:40:34.371]  I am radical.
[00:40:34.691 --> 00:40:39.413]  Stalin was bad, and so the angel of death.
[00:40:40.994 --> 00:40:44.775]  So were those who entered our troops in those cages.
[00:40:45.196 --> 00:40:50.898]  They peeped in for cages for years with mosquitoes biting them and rats all over them.
[00:40:51.801 --> 00:40:53.622]  And subsistence diets torturing them.
[00:40:53.642 --> 00:40:54.923]  And you're like, yeah, that's horrible.
[00:40:55.203 --> 00:40:57.205]  What do you think they're doing at Camp X-Ray?
[00:40:59.607 --> 00:41:00.907]  What do you think's going on?
[00:41:01.948 --> 00:41:03.109]  What do you think's happening?
[00:41:07.892 --> 00:41:08.973]  It's unbelievable, folks.
[00:41:09.353 --> 00:41:10.774]  We have gone over to the dark side.
[00:41:10.855 --> 00:41:11.495]  It has happened.
[00:41:12.776 --> 00:41:18.520]  That is, the people in control have, and they're trying to turn all of us, our entire country, over to evil.
[00:41:19.565 --> 00:41:24.627]  What does Ron Paul talk about in that neocon speech he gave July 10th?
[00:41:24.667 --> 00:41:26.748]  That 15-page article I read on air.
[00:41:27.588 --> 00:41:28.588]  The text of his speech.
[00:41:28.729 --> 00:41:31.950]  It's posted in the news and focus section of InfoWars.com.
[00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:35.371]  What was he talking about there?
[00:41:36.912 --> 00:41:42.974]  He talked about the neocon chieftains, where they said it, what speech, what book, what meeting, public stuff.
[00:41:44.426 --> 00:41:45.107]  This is a book.
[00:41:45.507 --> 00:41:50.090]  What he quoted in his speech was a book given to him by the Republican Leadership Conference.
[00:41:50.451 --> 00:41:52.993]  Where it said we must train the public to enter into evil.
[00:41:53.753 --> 00:41:54.834]  We must create evil.
[00:41:54.854 --> 00:41:56.435]  We must get the country to become evil.
[00:41:56.715 --> 00:41:58.797]  We must get them to join our pact.
[00:41:59.017 --> 00:41:59.758]  We must lie.
[00:41:59.778 --> 00:42:02.600]  We must create social welfare to control everyone.
[00:42:04.341 --> 00:42:05.542]  Machiavelli was good.
[00:42:05.662 --> 00:42:06.703]  Trotsky's good.
[00:42:09.198 --> 00:42:12.099]  That's Ron Paul just giving you their quotes.
[00:42:12.419 --> 00:42:14.940]  They hand this stuff out, people.
[00:42:18.542 --> 00:42:20.523]  And a lot of you go, well, I better shut up and be scared.
[00:42:21.043 --> 00:42:22.563]  Are you men out there?
[00:42:22.623 --> 00:42:32.748]  Don't you know that when you act like a cowardly Russian, or you act like a cowardly Chinese, or you act like a cowardly German, and you lay down to tyranny, it wins?
[00:42:35.369 --> 00:42:36.109]  Man, I'm telling you.
[00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:43.013]  I tell you, folks, I mean, I am not afraid one bit.
[00:42:43.693 --> 00:42:49.896]  I feel sad for my family, and I'm concerned for them, but I know that they're not going to be safe, period, if this system wins.
[00:42:50.076 --> 00:42:53.137]  So I know I'm doing the best thing I can, standing up.
[00:42:54.418 --> 00:42:56.619]  The New World Order could have a gun to my head right now.
[00:42:57.459 --> 00:43:03.622]  They could tell me to renounce what I'm doing, stop what I'm doing, and I'd tell them, go ahead and pull the trigger, buddy.
[00:43:04.545 --> 00:43:06.425]  Because I'm not a coward like you!
[00:43:06.805 --> 00:43:10.746]  Don't you know these FBI and BATF and these goons they're hiring?
[00:43:11.846 --> 00:43:14.507]  Most of them are scared to death and don't like what they're doing.
[00:43:14.607 --> 00:43:15.607]  I've talked to them.
[00:43:18.767 --> 00:43:21.088]  I was talking to a man who just got out of the Marine Corps.
[00:43:23.408 --> 00:43:26.689]  And he mentioned one of the top generals.
[00:43:26.709 --> 00:43:28.529]  Let's just say he's in line to be the commandant.
[00:43:28.849 --> 00:43:29.589]  The Marine Corps.
[00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:33.290]  He talked about how he was the aide of this general and
[00:43:34.096 --> 00:43:34.897]  He had the evidence.
[00:43:37.358 --> 00:43:42.522]  And he was talking about how the general, right after 911, just said, yep, well, you know, the government did it.
[00:43:43.463 --> 00:43:47.766]  But still, and told this young man, go ahead and get out.
[00:43:48.306 --> 00:43:49.567]  You don't want to be part of what's coming.
[00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:55.192]  When I was in college, my dad kept asking, what are you going to be?
[00:43:55.212 --> 00:43:55.852]  What are you going to do?
[00:43:55.892 --> 00:43:56.753]  And I said, I don't know.
[00:43:56.833 --> 00:43:58.714]  I said, I might go into teaching.
[00:43:58.794 --> 00:44:00.876]  I might go into federal law enforcement.
[00:44:01.016 --> 00:44:01.556]  I didn't know.
[00:44:01.636 --> 00:44:02.397]  Something interesting...
[00:44:02.978 --> 00:44:04.299]  And my dad said, come over to my office.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:05.921]  And there was his buddy.
[00:44:05.941 --> 00:44:07.762]  He was like one of the top federal marshals in Texas.
[00:44:07.802 --> 00:44:08.403]  He's retired now.
[00:44:08.423 --> 00:44:10.145]  And he goes, Alex, you're not a criminal, are you?
[00:44:10.465 --> 00:44:10.985]  And I said, no.
[00:44:11.005 --> 00:44:12.967]  And he said, then don't get into law enforcement.
[00:44:12.987 --> 00:44:14.949]  And I said, well, I wasn't seriously even considering it.
[00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:18.052]  He goes, well, I was going to be here today getting your dad to work on my teeth.
[00:44:18.492 --> 00:44:23.216]  Just a big old 6'4 guy, you know, all handsome, gray hair, looks like somebody in a movie.
[00:44:23.537 --> 00:44:26.519]  He's telling me, we go out to a little corner store, have some coffee.
[00:44:26.759 --> 00:44:28.461]  He says, Alex, don't join law enforcement.
[00:44:29.679 --> 00:44:30.420]  Don't get involved.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.161]  And he goes, you're not a criminal, are you?
[00:44:32.201 --> 00:44:32.661]  And I go, no.
[00:44:32.681 --> 00:44:34.182]  And he goes, well, you've got to be a criminal now.
[00:44:34.542 --> 00:44:36.424]  He goes, I'm going to be out soon, and I can't wait.
[00:44:42.908 --> 00:44:44.329]  But that's not enough, folks.
[00:44:44.409 --> 00:44:45.310]  It's not enough.
[00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:47.971]  You've got to go all the way and tell the truth.
[00:44:49.092 --> 00:44:50.453]  You've got to stand up to this.
[00:44:51.994 --> 00:44:57.898]  Look, they didn't take the old Robert Mueller airport and turn half of it into a movie studio and the other half into a concentration camp for nothing.
[00:44:58.618 --> 00:45:06.380]  They took a 747 hangar and put bolts and chains and port-a-potties and cots in there, put the Army out there and admitted on the news that it'll be used as a concentration camp.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.600]  They said an emergency relocation center.
[00:45:09.421 --> 00:45:11.121]  This was before 9-1-1.
[00:45:11.161 --> 00:45:12.001]  They put all this in.
[00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:23.844]  I just read where in England they say to herd, quote, herd people out of London and other big cities to rest in reception areas for the long term.
[00:45:26.745 --> 00:45:27.625]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:45:29.301 --> 00:45:30.201]  There's another headline.
[00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:32.042]  Terror planned empty London.
[00:45:33.562 --> 00:45:34.702]  Asia debt withdrawal.
[00:45:34.762 --> 00:45:35.523]  Threat to U.S.
[00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:36.123]  deficit.
[00:45:37.103 --> 00:45:38.843]  Mesa police kill another woman.
[00:45:38.883 --> 00:45:40.284]  Last week it was some little kid.
[00:45:41.544 --> 00:45:42.304]  Blew him away.
[00:45:42.324 --> 00:45:43.584]  Now they blew this woman away.
[00:45:44.365 --> 00:45:45.485]  Maybe they were protecting themselves.
[00:45:45.565 --> 00:45:45.945]  I don't know.
[00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:47.505]  But why didn't this used to happen like this?
[00:45:49.266 --> 00:45:50.966]  And now it gets more cops killed.
[00:45:50.986 --> 00:45:52.667]  This new SWAT system doesn't help them either.
[00:45:52.687 --> 00:45:53.867]  Look at the statistics, dummies.
[00:45:55.259 --> 00:45:56.180]  Stay where you are.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.682]  Fateful advice to Twin Towers victims reopens Manhattan's wounds.
[00:45:59.962 --> 00:46:01.343]  I never even covered this last week.
[00:46:01.363 --> 00:46:01.743]  You know why?
[00:46:01.763 --> 00:46:05.085]  Because we covered this 23 and a half months ago.
[00:46:06.405 --> 00:46:09.047]  That everybody was told to stay in the towers.
[00:46:09.427 --> 00:46:19.973]  Somebody came on the loudspeaker from the next door building, Building 7, run by the city, the emergency center, you know, the command bunker they built and had the CIA in there with Giuliani.
[00:46:20.534 --> 00:46:22.695]  They built two years before, a year and a half before.
[00:46:23.824 --> 00:46:26.807]  Yeah, somebody came over the command thing and said, Everyone, stay where you're at.
[00:46:27.007 --> 00:46:28.388]  Stay where you're at in both the towers.
[00:46:28.988 --> 00:46:32.371]  They'd evacuate for a piece of chewing gum on the floor, literally.
[00:46:33.091 --> 00:46:35.974]  They had an evacuation before that because of a piece of chewing gum on the floor.
[00:46:35.994 --> 00:46:37.155]  It got smeared.
[00:46:37.195 --> 00:46:38.656]  Somebody thought it was a bioweapon.
[00:46:39.817 --> 00:46:41.378]  But now a plane crashes in.
[00:46:41.458 --> 00:46:42.479]  No one evacuate.
[00:46:42.879 --> 00:46:44.660]  Stay where you are in both towers.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.901]  We need to kill a lot of you to get sympathy for the police state.
[00:46:50.261 --> 00:46:51.021]  Stay right there.
[00:46:51.061 --> 00:46:52.702]  No one can identify whose voice it was.
[00:46:52.742 --> 00:46:53.902]  Just stay there.
[00:46:53.962 --> 00:46:54.603]  Do not leave.
[00:46:54.643 --> 00:46:55.403]  You could get in trouble.
[00:46:56.443 --> 00:46:57.023]  Stay there.
[00:46:57.323 --> 00:46:58.084]  We told you that.
[00:46:58.104 --> 00:47:02.525]  Remember, they didn't claim that the firefighters' radios all malfunctioned.
[00:47:02.545 --> 00:47:03.605]  Turned out that was a total lie.
[00:47:03.625 --> 00:47:06.946]  The firefighters, the transcript, New York Daily News reported bombs in the building.
[00:47:09.207 --> 00:47:11.128]  Met your allegations over September 11th.
[00:47:12.288 --> 00:47:13.569]  That's how it went in Telegraph.
[00:47:14.169 --> 00:47:14.449]  Michael...
[00:47:15.792 --> 00:47:25.557]  Metcher, one of Tony Blair's longest-serving ministers until earlier this year, sparked outrage yesterday by suggesting that the United States government deliberately allowed the terrorist attacks of September 11th to take place.
[00:47:26.518 --> 00:47:35.582]  And Michael Metcher, Member of Parliament, simply listed the PNAC document from 2000 where they called for terrorist attacks.
[00:47:35.602 --> 00:47:36.263]  I'm going to get to that.
[00:47:37.663 --> 00:47:44.607]  And he questioned why military jets were not sent to intercept the hijacked passenger aircraft on that morning of the outrage two years ago.
[00:47:47.265 --> 00:47:48.025]  He said, could U.S.
[00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:51.867]  air security operations have been deliberately stood down on September 11th?
[00:47:52.527 --> 00:47:53.588]  If so, why?
[00:47:53.768 --> 00:47:56.849]  Oh, no, they normally stand down for an hour plus, you know.
[00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:12.897]  And then passports magically fall out of the sky, uncharted, and the deputy director of the FBI, who'd been blowing the whistle, saying, quote, in a TV interview in England and France, the government's going to use terror as an excuse to invade foreign countries.
[00:48:14.299 --> 00:48:16.423]  Then he dies and his body gets thrown into the rubble.
[00:48:18.246 --> 00:48:21.110]  First they say it's the uncharted body and they say, oh, we never found his body.
[00:48:21.551 --> 00:48:22.732]  Pick whatever story you want.
[00:48:22.753 --> 00:48:27.300]  Okay, I'm going to come back and just keep covering news and then we'll get to some calls.
[00:48:27.981 --> 00:48:28.642]  Just stay with us.
[00:48:31.411 --> 00:48:35.853]  Get Body Balance, the leading phytonutrient product on the planet by Life Force International.

[00:49:31.679 --> 00:49:35.562]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:49:35.802 --> 00:49:41.226]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:49:41.506 --> 00:49:51.873]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:49:52.053 --> 00:49:56.376]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:49:56.836 --> 00:50:04.919]  And volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:50:05.199 --> 00:50:11.582]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and fowl taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:50:11.682 --> 00:50:16.163]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:50:16.383 --> 00:50:20.585]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:50:20.965 --> 00:50:25.267]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:50:27.268 --> 00:50:39.453]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:50:39.733 --> 00:50:44.475]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:50:44.675 --> 00:50:50.338]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:50:50.578 --> 00:50:51.299]  We're good to go.
[00:51:06.613 --> 00:51:07.093]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:36.189 --> 00:51:38.090]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:41.410]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:43.451 --> 00:51:44.331]  Something's happened.
[00:51:45.212 --> 00:51:55.514]  We've done such a good job exposing the globalists, how they carry out the terror attacks, that the New World Order is real, that the Illuminati is real, that they're just throwing it in everyone's face now.
[00:51:56.795 --> 00:51:57.955]  They're just coming right out with it.
[00:51:59.255 --> 00:52:04.857]  I was just talking to Vince again, he's running the show, during the break, and he said, yeah, too bad you don't watch TV anymore because...
[00:52:05.535 --> 00:52:10.999]  He said this weekend he was watching the history of the Statue of Liberty on the History Channel.
[00:52:11.499 --> 00:52:16.203]  And he said they came right out and said it is an Illuminati symbol given to us by the Illuminati.
[00:52:16.263 --> 00:52:17.084]  Well, that's true.
[00:52:17.104 --> 00:52:19.125]  The Illuminati is a real organization.
[00:52:19.385 --> 00:52:26.330]  It wants to kill all Christians and take all your private property and set up absolute despotism.
[00:52:26.691 --> 00:52:29.573]  That's their own stated documents in major libraries of Germany.
[00:52:30.615 --> 00:52:33.576]  And they run the country now, and that's just their old term.
[00:52:33.596 --> 00:52:35.576]  They're now called the New World Order or the Globalist.
[00:52:36.936 --> 00:52:49.059]  And, yeah, the Statue of Liberty is a man in drag holding up the torch of Lucifer and the pyramids on the back of the dollar bill that says the New World Order, announcing the birth of the New World Order.
[00:52:49.939 --> 00:52:54.340]  But, again, Rush Limbaugh has his cook detector that if you talk about a New World Order, you're crazy.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:57.801]  It doesn't exist, as his books are published by a CFR publisher.
[00:52:59.967 --> 00:53:01.788]  So that's America, folks.
[00:53:01.828 --> 00:53:03.129]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[00:53:03.169 --> 00:53:04.010]  That's what we're fighting.
[00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:19.979]  And so now they've got shows on ABC where torture is good, and they've announced, yeah, there's camps for your safety, relocation centers, but it's for your safety, and we're going to have a national DNA database, and we're going to take everything you've got.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.880]  You're going to be slaves.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:22.981]  How does that sound?
[00:53:23.101 --> 00:53:25.282]  They're trying to sell you this, and it's not working.
[00:53:25.963 --> 00:53:27.223]  By the way, be afraid.
[00:53:27.283 --> 00:53:28.264]  Be very afraid.
[00:53:29.702 --> 00:53:36.626]  Bush's approval rating has hit 40, what is it, 44% in a Zogby poll on average.
[00:53:37.526 --> 00:53:39.487]  With conservatives, it's like 50% now.
[00:53:39.547 --> 00:53:41.348]  With Democrats, it's like 30-something percent.
[00:53:41.368 --> 00:53:44.669]  So overall, he's got a low 40s approval rating.
[00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:50.953]  And I have said, if it goes below 40, you had better believe there's going to be massive terror.
[00:53:51.873 --> 00:53:54.915]  Not that George Bush is running anything or is going to launch terror attacks.
[00:53:54.955 --> 00:53:57.536]  He's just going to read off a teleprompter how much he loves us.
[00:53:58.729 --> 00:54:01.773]  There'll be action figures made of him landing on aircraft carriers.
[00:54:01.813 --> 00:54:02.714]  That's total theater.
[00:54:03.095 --> 00:54:07.100]  Just like Lionel Chetwin's made-for-TV movie that's coming out this week.
[00:54:07.401 --> 00:54:08.682]  That's how Bush is his big hero.
[00:54:09.423 --> 00:54:13.368]  But the establishment, he's their front man right now, just like under Clinton.
[00:54:13.869 --> 00:54:15.151]  And brace yourselves, folks.
[00:54:15.171 --> 00:54:15.992]  That's all I can say.
[00:54:17.765 --> 00:54:19.186]  Brace yourselves.
[00:54:19.306 --> 00:54:20.547]  We're going to start the second hour.
[00:54:20.567 --> 00:54:23.690]  We will take calls on the second hour and cover more news and more detail.
[00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:28.614]  Tell a free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:28.634 --> 00:54:31.396]  If you disagree with me, give me a call.
[00:54:31.717 --> 00:54:32.697]  Hit me with your best shot.
[00:54:32.878 --> 00:54:33.678]  Fire away.
[00:54:34.058 --> 00:54:37.081]  Or you agree or you've got a question or comment, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:38.882 --> 00:54:45.448]  But if you want to tell people about the real New World Order, not this lovey, touchy, feely, happy, fuzzy one they're telling you about,
[00:54:46.028 --> 00:54:48.211]  Get the new book, Order Out of Chaos, I've published.
[00:54:48.291 --> 00:54:51.555]  Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terrorism and the New World Order.
[00:54:51.935 --> 00:54:57.001]  Both the Clinton and Bush administrations protected Osama Bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda network before September 11th.
[00:54:57.482 --> 00:54:58.563]  The highest levels of the U.S.
[00:54:58.583 --> 00:55:01.367]  government were complicit in the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[00:55:01.887 --> 00:55:06.649]  Many of the named 9-1-1 hijackers are still alive, and real culprits can never be identified.
[00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:12.331]  British MI5 have infiltrated the IRA and are carrying out terrorist attacks to maintain a divided Ireland.
[00:55:12.691 --> 00:55:17.533]  Chaos mongers are arming tyrants worldwide as a pretext for endless war and empire building.
[00:55:18.053 --> 00:55:20.014]  An despotic New World Order is being constructed.
[00:55:20.294 --> 00:55:22.295]  How it threatens all of us and what you can do to stop it.
[00:55:23.895 --> 00:55:24.175]  Don't wait.
[00:55:24.216 --> 00:55:24.556]  Get the books.
[00:55:24.576 --> 00:55:25.216]  Get the films now.
[00:55:25.236 --> 00:55:25.717]  Call toll-free 1-888-2595.
[00:55:49.155 --> 00:55:49.255]  3-3-1-3-9.
[00:55:49.335 --> 00:55:49.915]  That's 8-8-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[00:55:49.975 --> 00:55:52.316]  Expose the murdering terrorists.
[00:55:52.516 --> 00:55:53.137]  Get the films.
[00:55:53.417 --> 00:55:54.197]  Get the books.
[00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:55.978]  Spread the word now, troops.
[00:56:02.646 --> 00:56:14.250]  Also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001-3001, South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04-888-253-3139.
[00:56:17.531 --> 00:56:18.411]  Second hour of your calls.
[00:56:18.451 --> 00:56:19.371]  More news straight ahead.
[00:56:21.492 --> 00:56:22.012]  Hello, folks.
[00:56:22.092 --> 00:56:24.953]  Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:56:25.233 --> 00:56:28.734]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:56:28.814 --> 00:56:32.195]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed.
[00:56:35.194 --> 00:56:38.435]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:47.497]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.157 --> 00:56:49.237]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:49.917 --> 00:56:51.097]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.117 --> 00:56:52.538]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.258 --> 00:56:54.178]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.818 --> 00:56:58.619]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:03.080]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:06.981 --> 00:57:18.428]  America is being broken up, hacked to pieces, decimated, annihilated, denigrated, leveled, minced, crushed.
[00:57:20.289 --> 00:57:24.952]  It's being torched right now in front of you, my friends, and it makes me sick.
[00:57:24.992 --> 00:57:27.494]  It makes my blood boil.
[00:57:29.035 --> 00:57:32.417]  But I tell you what cools me off is the love of my family and my God.
[00:57:33.436 --> 00:57:40.682]  And that's what gives me my driving force and energy to stand up against the New World Order and the sicko control freaks that they are.
[00:57:40.802 --> 00:57:43.344]  All right, I've got a bunch of other news I'm going to get to in this hour.
[00:57:44.225 --> 00:57:55.014]  There's a lot of it, folks, and I still have more to detail about this new made-for-TV movie coming out this week where Bush gets angry and says, I want to have a fistfight with Saddam and bin Laden.
[00:57:55.415 --> 00:57:57.496]  They have to restrain him because he loves America so much.
[00:57:57.536 --> 00:58:01.660]  I mean, it's like stuff made for a professional wrestler mentality, you know.
[00:58:04.252 --> 00:58:16.467]  For the type of people that believe that professional wrestling is real, they're going to love this new Lionel Chetwin special that's going to be airing on one of the big networks.
[00:58:17.108 --> 00:58:20.312]  Lionel Chetwin is a big screenwriter who threatened me, so we're going to get you.
[00:58:20.852 --> 00:58:23.836]  I was out in California about a year ago.
[00:58:24.591 --> 00:58:28.274]  Now, that's coming up, and he's part of the media takeover.
[00:58:29.194 --> 00:58:35.618]  This guy on the conspiracy zone, when he debated me, said that, oh, they weren't involved in taking over the media or producing government propaganda.
[00:58:36.719 --> 00:58:42.603]  That integrates nicely with the matrix, the threat matrix, and it says, our nation is a target.
[00:58:42.643 --> 00:58:43.944]  This is the new thing on ABC.
[00:58:44.264 --> 00:58:45.925]  Al-Qaeda and other deadly enemies.
[00:58:45.965 --> 00:58:46.626]  That's gun owners.
[00:58:46.746 --> 00:58:47.887]  We'll be evil gun groups.
[00:58:47.927 --> 00:58:48.147]  Watch.
[00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:49.680]  Our nation is a target.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.345]  Al Qaeda and other deadly enemies are determined to destroy our way of life.
[00:58:52.906 --> 00:58:55.531]  An attack could come at any time from anywhere around the globe.
[00:58:56.431 --> 00:59:05.136]  Against this rising threat, the Homeland Security Agency has created a highly specialized elite task force trained and equipped to counter anyone or anything that threatens our nation.
[00:59:05.597 --> 00:59:09.039]  The head of the super-secret team is Special Agent John Kilmer.
[00:59:09.439 --> 00:59:17.144]  He reports only to President and has authority to call upon the technical skills, firepower, and specialist agents of the FBI, CIA, and NSA.
[00:59:17.684 --> 00:59:20.906]  Working with cutting-edge technology and vast stores of chutzpah.
[00:59:21.806 --> 00:59:22.927]  Folks, you heard me right.
[00:59:22.947 --> 00:59:24.288]  I mean, come on.
[00:59:25.174 --> 00:59:29.976]  The clandestine team fights the many faces of terror to keep America safe.
[00:59:30.496 --> 00:59:35.157]  The one wrinkle in Kilmer's dream team is his ex-wife, Frankie.
[00:59:35.878 --> 00:59:39.159]  She's as beautiful as she is fearless and lethal.
[00:59:39.519 --> 00:59:44.100]  Together they've averted disasters of all kinds, except their marriage.
[00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:51.663]  The stories ripped from the headlines threat Matrix as a drama, with a ticking clock in an area as deep and complex as today's world.
[00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:54.035]  Well, the government calls it the threat matrix.
[00:59:54.055 --> 00:59:55.296]  They shut up Homeland Security.
[00:59:55.316 --> 00:59:58.416]  They're shifting our entire economy under its fascist control.
[00:59:58.436 --> 01:00:09.558]  And they show this woman right here in the middle of this photo I got on Infowars.com of the twit cast of a little Joseph Minglas we're supposed to worship.
[01:00:10.518 --> 01:00:11.738]  And she's torturing some guy.
[01:00:11.798 --> 01:00:13.619]  I mean, this guy's got lacerations.
[01:00:13.659 --> 01:00:16.539]  He's naked, chained down, being tortured.
[01:00:17.399 --> 01:00:19.220]  And she's good.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.900]  She's answering my questions!
[01:00:22.463 --> 01:00:24.885]  I mean, she's the good guy.
[01:00:25.965 --> 01:00:28.227]  So again, don't complain about Joseph Mingler.
[01:00:28.247 --> 01:00:29.087]  I don't want to hear you.
[01:00:29.508 --> 01:00:30.728]  He was a loving individual.
[01:00:30.768 --> 01:00:31.949]  Let's make a show about him.
[01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:33.230]  Let's have him.
[01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:39.614]  Let's strap people down and torture them and go, Joseph Mingler fought for the Reich against the terrorists.
[01:00:39.994 --> 01:00:41.555]  He was so good.
[01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:44.337]  This fall on ABC.
[01:00:46.258 --> 01:00:47.199]  This fall on ABC.
[01:00:48.368 --> 01:00:51.049]  The North Vietnamese fought against the evil Americans.
[01:00:51.389 --> 01:00:53.930]  Notice how they extract information with electrodes.
[01:00:54.311 --> 01:00:56.231]  Keeping men for years in tiny cages.
[01:00:56.492 --> 01:00:58.192]  Watch them die of malaria.
[01:00:59.153 --> 01:01:00.933]  We do this now at Camp X-Ray.
[01:01:01.394 --> 01:01:04.635]  Open to the elements with the mosquitoes biting you 24 hours a day.
[01:01:05.755 --> 01:01:08.677]  Giant buckets of water put out nearby to breed the mosquitoes.
[01:01:08.697 --> 01:01:10.297]  This is what loving good people do.
[01:01:11.078 --> 01:01:12.638]  Think of how sick this is!
[01:01:12.899 --> 01:01:13.839]  Come on, government!
[01:01:14.674 --> 01:01:15.615]  I know you're listening.
[01:01:15.675 --> 01:01:16.655]  What's wrong with you?
[01:01:16.695 --> 01:01:18.256]  What's your major malfunction?
[01:01:19.416 --> 01:01:21.397]  We've got to stop the terror, Mr. Jones.
[01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:23.678]  We've got to do it to win.
[01:01:23.838 --> 01:01:25.439]  They told us that in the briefings.
[01:01:25.959 --> 01:01:26.680]  You idiots.
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.001]  Your bosses carry the attacks out.
[01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:30.802]  They're profiting from the attacks.
[01:01:30.822 --> 01:01:31.922]  They're planning more.
[01:01:31.942 --> 01:01:36.064]  We're going to have no future, you idiots, if you don't stand up and say no to this.
[01:01:36.565 --> 01:01:39.206]  You ensure your own destruction by the course you're on.
[01:01:39.426 --> 01:01:40.727]  Turn off of it now!
[01:01:42.546 --> 01:01:43.727]  Ask yourself these questions.
[01:01:43.827 --> 01:01:45.529]  Do you miss out on time with your loved ones?
[01:01:45.729 --> 01:01:46.890]  Are you making what you're worth?
[01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:49.612]  Are you wasting your life building someone else's fortune?
[01:01:49.852 --> 01:01:50.953]  Why not build your own?
[01:01:51.254 --> 01:01:57.459]  Imagine working your own hours, building your own business, generating an unlimited residual income and having the time to enjoy it.
[01:01:57.659 --> 01:02:00.582]  With your own life force business, you can have all this and more.
[01:02:00.822 --> 01:02:02.643]  Why not have the home and car of your choice?
[01:02:02.864 --> 01:02:04.525]  Why not take luxurious vacations?
[01:02:04.765 --> 01:02:06.306]  Why not send your kids to college?
[01:02:06.566 --> 01:02:07.707]  Why not retire rich?

[01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:35.342]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:35.362 --> 01:02:38.324]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:38.344 --> 01:02:40.666]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:02:40.706 --> 01:02:41.426]  The New World Order.
[01:02:59.081 --> 01:03:03.303]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:10.286]  We rip the Senator-Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:03:10.426 --> 01:03:12.467]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:03:12.807 --> 01:03:23.251]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:03:23.431 --> 01:03:26.132]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[01:03:26.272 --> 01:03:26.633]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:26.693 --> 01:03:27.834]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:03:43.214 --> 01:03:47.716]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:52.159]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:03:52.459 --> 01:03:52.999]  We listened.
[01:03:53.299 --> 01:03:58.282]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:03:58.562 --> 01:03:59.043]  We listened.
[01:03:59.443 --> 01:04:02.464]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:03.445]  We listened.
[01:04:03.905 --> 01:04:07.227]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during pastures.
[01:04:07.287 --> 01:04:11.770]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:37.793]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:39.695]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:04:43.698 --> 01:04:49.723]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:50.343 --> 01:04:53.385]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:56.568 --> 01:05:01.692]  Let me just state this a little bit more succinctly and focused.
[01:05:04.531 --> 01:05:31.521]  I have been sent by listeners, dozens of tapes, keep them coming, of every newscast conceivable, local newscast, national newscast, telling us how great torture is, how they have new ways of scrapping you down and hooking electrodes directly into your brain, manipulating your brain with wires, turning your heart and lungs off, and then hooking an MRI to your brain, and if they think you're lying, they turn your heart and lungs off, how it's the most terrorizing thing you can do, and how painful it is, and
[01:05:32.742 --> 01:05:33.662]  How wonderful it is.
[01:05:33.722 --> 01:05:43.865]  And then I go to try to see a movie, open range with my wife, last night, and there's an ad for a show called Threat Matrix on ABC, which if you watch it, you're a sicko.
[01:05:44.245 --> 01:05:44.886]  Boycott them.
[01:05:45.466 --> 01:05:46.506]  Turn your cable off.
[01:05:47.426 --> 01:05:48.687]  Turn your satellite off.
[01:05:49.167 --> 01:05:50.367]  Don't let your kids watch this.
[01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:54.008]  And email ABC News and say, I'm not going to watch you, and I'm going to boycott you.
[01:05:54.668 --> 01:05:57.929]  Because I saw the ad last night, and it goes, their power is unlimited.
[01:05:57.949 --> 01:06:00.110]  Their authority unquestioned.
[01:06:01.934 --> 01:06:03.895]  They're methods unorthodox.
[01:06:03.955 --> 01:06:09.718]  And it shows a guy hooked into a high-tech torture chair, like something out of Brazil.
[01:06:09.738 --> 01:06:10.618]  You know that movie Brazil?
[01:06:10.999 --> 01:06:13.100]  Terry Gilliam film, kind of a 1984 remake?
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.241]  He's strapped into this torture device.
[01:06:15.601 --> 01:06:17.022]  He's got all these things hooked into him.
[01:06:17.322 --> 01:06:18.442]  He's screaming in pain.
[01:06:18.722 --> 01:06:21.144]  His body's like all purple and lacerated.
[01:06:21.604 --> 01:06:24.645]  And there's this little sicko control freak leaning over him.
[01:06:24.946 --> 01:06:26.046]  The Nazi of the future.
[01:06:26.326 --> 01:06:28.087]  A little greebling, beady-eyed woman.
[01:06:29.288 --> 01:06:31.509]  So when you better answer my questions...
[01:06:34.779 --> 01:06:39.320]  And it is just amazing, folks, to sit there and watch this.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:43.161]  And they have all the little typecasted characters.
[01:06:43.201 --> 01:06:43.921]  They show them all.
[01:06:44.361 --> 01:06:45.062]  Meet Donnie.
[01:06:45.122 --> 01:06:45.762]  Meet Jenny.
[01:06:45.802 --> 01:06:46.442]  Meet, you know, whatever.
[01:06:46.462 --> 01:06:47.982]  And it's like the little teenage girl.
[01:06:48.042 --> 01:06:48.883]  I love torture.
[01:06:49.303 --> 01:06:50.103]  Cuts to the next guy.
[01:06:50.123 --> 01:06:51.223]  I surveil you.
[01:06:51.243 --> 01:06:52.984]  Shows the satellite surveilling everything you do.
[01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:54.264]  It's for your safety.
[01:06:54.764 --> 01:06:59.325]  I mean, folks, it was like living in 1984.
[01:06:59.385 --> 01:07:00.045]  We march in.
[01:07:00.065 --> 01:07:00.905]  It's a big screen.
[01:07:00.925 --> 01:07:02.886]  You know, 10 minutes of hate.
[01:07:03.678 --> 01:07:04.539]  There it was.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:06.300]  Everywhere.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.241]  It's everywhere.
[01:07:07.321 --> 01:07:08.042]  It's on TV.
[01:07:08.262 --> 01:07:10.364]  It's in Time Magazine for kids.
[01:07:10.624 --> 01:07:12.205]  We're going to put RFIDs in the money.
[01:07:12.906 --> 01:07:14.487]  All kids need microchips.
[01:07:14.527 --> 01:07:15.628]  Turn on Nickelodeon.
[01:07:16.749 --> 01:07:18.591]  Report if your parents have got guns.
[01:07:18.631 --> 01:07:20.012]  I mean, folks, it's everywhere.
[01:07:20.192 --> 01:07:20.773]  Look at it.
[01:07:20.873 --> 01:07:21.774]  It is incredible.
[01:07:23.275 --> 01:07:25.437]  And it's getting worse and worse by the day.
[01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:26.868]  I talked about U.S.
[01:07:26.888 --> 01:07:28.229]  News & World Report, the whole thing.
[01:07:28.509 --> 01:07:30.831]  Well, satellites are going to track and taxi-drive your car.
[01:07:30.951 --> 01:07:31.772]  All phones are tracked.
[01:07:32.012 --> 01:07:33.534]  Homeland Security is watching you.
[01:07:33.794 --> 01:07:34.675]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:07:36.897 --> 01:07:38.618]  Don't you know what the Fourth Amendment is?
[01:07:38.658 --> 01:07:40.660]  People go, well, we did get hit by terrorists.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.703]  We got hit by the military-industrial complex.
[01:07:44.323 --> 01:07:48.407]  Anybody that's got an IQ above 80 points knows the globalists did that.
[01:07:49.888 --> 01:07:51.390]  The whole world knows it now.
[01:07:52.293 --> 01:07:58.797]  The problem is they say America did it, and now America's the bad empire, and America's taken over all these sovereign countries.
[01:07:59.498 --> 01:08:15.969]  No, America's being used as the glove over the fist of Europe and the New World Order to carry out the dirty work, and later the UN comes in, and NATO comes in, and takes over, and the IMF, and the World Bank, and the OECD, and the XM Bank, and the World Health Organization.
[01:08:16.449 --> 01:08:17.630]  I mentioned the WTO.
[01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:22.964]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[01:08:23.964 --> 01:08:25.545]  And I'm trying to save lives here.
[01:08:25.585 --> 01:08:27.446]  They're telling you, brace for huge attacks.
[01:08:27.486 --> 01:08:28.447]  A lot of you are going to die.
[01:08:28.647 --> 01:08:29.848]  We're going to take all your rights.
[01:08:29.888 --> 01:08:30.688]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:08:30.928 --> 01:08:32.749]  You can't leave your house under a red alert.
[01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:35.951]  That's what they said in New Jersey.
[01:08:35.971 --> 01:08:36.511]  FEMA said that.
[01:08:36.711 --> 01:08:37.992]  You'll be an enemy if you leave your house.
[01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:38.753]  No more liberties.
[01:08:39.013 --> 01:08:40.313]  No more freedoms that we had in America.
[01:08:40.333 --> 01:08:41.194]  They're all going to be gone.
[01:08:41.454 --> 01:08:41.954]  We're sorry.
[01:08:41.974 --> 01:08:42.715]  It's to keep you safe.
[01:08:43.135 --> 01:08:45.977]  It's like in Seattle, in my film, The Takeover.
[01:08:46.637 --> 01:08:50.139]  I have the newscast, the news article, interviews with police, amateur video.
[01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:53.280]  It's like 35 minutes of the two-hour and five-minute film.
[01:08:53.981 --> 01:08:58.903]  And the police go, yeah, we were told not to stop the anarchists, the 50 guys, the black bloc.
[01:08:58.943 --> 01:09:00.964]  They wore black outfits like the police.
[01:09:01.544 --> 01:09:04.846]  They burned trash cans, busted out some windows, hit some cops in the head with bottles.
[01:09:05.306 --> 01:09:08.147]  You see their superiors telling the cops not to go after them.
[01:09:08.468 --> 01:09:12.209]  You see citizens, peace protesters, trying to tackle the government terrorists.
[01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:19.533]  Then you find out, the nightly news reported it there, never on the national news, that the government hired these people, put them in a government building.
[01:09:20.405 --> 01:09:22.887]  So 50 people go out, break some windows, hit some cops.
[01:09:22.927 --> 01:09:23.868]  The cops can't touch them.
[01:09:24.168 --> 01:09:30.092]  They retreat, move in to a high-rise building, shipped in by the government, by the way.
[01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:39.999]  And then the news has the images of violence, and so the 50 people retreat after a day of breaking stuff, and people go, what's wrong with the cops?
[01:09:40.019 --> 01:09:41.760]  They won't do anything on the national news.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.262]  And finally they do what they've got to do.
[01:09:45.282 --> 01:09:46.402]  In their black ski masks.
[01:09:46.662 --> 01:09:47.923]  They're all unleashed.
[01:09:47.943 --> 01:09:50.203]  They run into neighborhoods, beat old women.
[01:09:50.703 --> 01:09:56.144]  We got video of women on the ground being kicked by police from both directions, stomping them as they beg and plead.
[01:09:56.164 --> 01:09:59.745]  A woman with a red cross on her back trying to deliver aid.
[01:09:59.765 --> 01:10:02.925]  They chase her down, knock off her bicycle, start stomping and kicking her.
[01:10:03.185 --> 01:10:10.787]  I got guys in black uniforms with black helmets, folks, with black shotguns stomping on a 20-year-old woman.
[01:10:13.294 --> 01:10:13.814]  Old women.
[01:10:14.114 --> 01:10:19.637]  I've got the city council meetings where old women come up and go, I just live in the neighborhood and I came out.
[01:10:20.658 --> 01:10:22.719]  Why were you in the neighborhood?
[01:10:22.859 --> 01:10:24.380]  They were attacking old women.
[01:10:26.321 --> 01:10:27.341]  It's the same thing, folks.
[01:10:27.661 --> 01:10:29.282]  But see, that's the national news.
[01:10:29.462 --> 01:10:30.823]  Oh, you saw what the anarchists did.
[01:10:30.883 --> 01:10:34.685]  And then the last two days of the meeting, they said no protest allowed in the city.
[01:10:35.705 --> 01:10:41.108]  And people walk up to the checkpoints at the intersection leading into the city downtown and go...
[01:10:42.034 --> 01:10:45.275]  Why can't I go into the city with this No WTO sticker?
[01:10:45.295 --> 01:10:46.575]  And they go, No protest.
[01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:48.016]  No protest zone.
[01:10:48.476 --> 01:10:48.956]  They go, Why?
[01:10:48.996 --> 01:10:49.797]  What about the First Amendment?
[01:10:49.857 --> 01:10:52.017]  And the cop goes, You saw what happened to our city.
[01:10:52.637 --> 01:10:54.278]  We're not going to allow that to happen again.
[01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:57.599]  Folks, you have 50 people burning some trash cans.
[01:10:58.524 --> 01:11:05.365]  Gives them the pretext to tackle women and put 500 people in a FEMA camp, that's on the film, and do all this.
[01:11:05.625 --> 01:11:14.307]  What do you think is going to happen when they nerve gas or release smallpox or detonate a suitcase nuke or dirty bomb that they're scripting you, that they're preparing you for?
[01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:18.028]  It's incredible.
[01:11:19.588 --> 01:11:23.669]  Everything I do is trying to warn you of government-sponsored terror.
[01:11:24.449 --> 01:11:27.650]  Everything I do is trying to expose problem-reaction solutions.
[01:11:29.289 --> 01:11:32.270]  They create a crisis and then pose as your savior and take your liberty.
[01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:33.311]  Figure it out.
[01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:34.851]  That's what Hitler did with the Reichstag.
[01:11:37.472 --> 01:11:40.293]  I'm about to go to Charles and Brett and Scott and Dino and others.
[01:11:41.874 --> 01:11:43.555]  Folks, I want you to start thinking for yourselves.
[01:11:43.655 --> 01:11:44.975]  I'm begging you to think for yourselves.
[01:11:46.516 --> 01:11:48.757]  I know what's scary to admit reality and face reality.
[01:11:48.917 --> 01:11:56.260]  They're counting on you to go into escapism, to go into the sports and the movies and the malls and to just ignore what's happening.
[01:11:57.327 --> 01:11:58.708]  And the bars and the rest of it.
[01:11:59.108 --> 01:12:01.589]  You've got to spend some time caring about America.
[01:12:01.809 --> 01:12:06.251]  And you've got to join us as part of history, standing up against the greatest tyranny ever seen.
[01:12:08.192 --> 01:12:10.933]  But I'm telling you, things aren't going good for the New World Order.
[01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:17.496]  I've got a stack of articles where government officials all over the world are accusing the globalists of carrying out 9-11.
[01:12:19.337 --> 01:12:20.258]  It's coming out.
[01:12:20.978 --> 01:12:23.799]  And so the globalists are getting desperate and turning up the propaganda.
[01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:25.480]  And I'm telling you, it's not working.
[01:12:28.163 --> 01:12:29.464]  Let's talk to Charles in Pennsylvania.
[01:12:29.484 --> 01:12:30.365]  Let's go to these calls quick.
[01:12:30.385 --> 01:12:31.086]  Charles, go ahead.
[01:12:31.926 --> 01:12:35.229]  God bless Judge Roy Moore, the next governor of Alabama.
[01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:39.032]  Hey, what they're doing is really amazing.
[01:12:39.113 --> 01:12:40.414]  I mean, to just watch this.
[01:12:40.454 --> 01:12:42.295]  Did you see how they turned this up?
[01:12:42.375 --> 01:12:48.721]  What I called you about was I was listening to this interview of a guy saying it was all Clinton's fault this Ben Lott.
[01:12:49.461 --> 01:12:54.886]  And I asked him, I called in there and asked him about, well, wasn't he in that hospital in the United Arab Emirates?
[01:12:55.467 --> 01:12:55.747]  Yeah.
[01:12:56.169 --> 01:12:57.710]  Well, it was his mother.
[01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:02.692]  He just visited her once, and with their security, I'm sure there were no CIA people in there.
[01:13:03.172 --> 01:13:06.434]  Oh, yeah, he met 10 days with the deputy director of the CIA.
[01:13:06.854 --> 01:13:08.194]  Yeah, well, he denied all that.
[01:13:08.335 --> 01:13:09.655]  It's all Clinton's fault.
[01:13:09.735 --> 01:13:12.296]  Oh, by the way, well, it is Clinton's fault, and Bush's.
[01:13:12.316 --> 01:13:12.917]  They're just puppets.
[01:13:13.257 --> 01:13:15.318]  I got that screwball coming on in two days.
[01:13:15.738 --> 01:13:16.078]  Who's that?
[01:13:16.098 --> 01:13:17.299]  The same guy.
[01:13:17.679 --> 01:13:19.920]  Yeah, but the point here is that...
[01:13:22.228 --> 01:13:24.275]  Clinton, the Republicans put out a report in 99.
[01:13:24.616 --> 01:13:26.964]  In Serbia, they used bin Laden to attack the Serbs.
[01:13:27.024 --> 01:13:27.726]  Now, he was there with the CIA.
[01:13:29.984 --> 01:13:33.966]  Every time they needed a diversion, something got blown up every time Clinton got caught with his pants down.
[01:13:34.306 --> 01:13:37.327]  Of course, he works for the government, so of course Clinton protected him.
[01:13:37.487 --> 01:13:38.368]  And so does Bush.
[01:13:38.788 --> 01:13:44.671]  And so, yeah, that's what the filthy neocons, the lying neocons are doing, is going, well, Clinton did it.
[01:13:44.811 --> 01:13:47.092]  Well, then why don't you go after him for pardon gain?
[01:13:47.473 --> 01:13:48.653]  Oh, no, they won't do that.
[01:13:48.713 --> 01:13:52.035]  It's just demonize Clinton, but never nail him to the wall.
[01:13:52.615 --> 01:13:58.760]  So I don't want to hear the Ann Coulters and the other slimeballs talk about Clinton, because they are Bill Clinton.
[01:14:00.541 --> 01:14:05.886]  Well, Bush just signed his trade pact with Chile and Singapore.
[01:14:06.386 --> 01:14:08.308]  Yes, selling even more of our jobs out.
[01:14:08.328 --> 01:14:09.268]  Just love it, folks.
[01:14:09.428 --> 01:14:10.990]  When you don't have anything, just thank them.
[01:14:11.130 --> 01:14:15.193]  And when your gas is four bucks a gallon, as I told you it would be in the next few years, thank them.
[01:14:16.013 --> 01:14:16.934]  Let me tell you something.
[01:14:16.954 --> 01:14:20.356]  My power bill just five years ago was $200, $300 a month.
[01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.737]  It's like $700, $1,000 now.
[01:14:22.918 --> 01:14:24.579]  They're raping us everywhere.
[01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:26.440]  You pay a $700 electric bill?
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:27.661]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:14:27.681 --> 01:14:27.921]  Yeah.
[01:14:28.261 --> 01:14:29.021]  Oh, my God.
[01:14:29.622 --> 01:14:32.724]  Well, he says the United States supports free trade because...
[01:14:33.445 --> 01:14:38.548]  A world that trades in freedom will grow in prosperity and in security.
[01:14:38.828 --> 01:14:41.010]  And they're challenging civilization.
[01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:44.632]  Anyone who doesn't go along with this is challenging civilization.
[01:14:44.892 --> 01:14:46.653]  Oh, yeah, we've really given them civilization.
[01:14:48.254 --> 01:14:52.276]  Thousands of tons of depleted uranium at 1,900 times safe levels.
[01:14:53.097 --> 01:14:54.318]  No water or power.
[01:14:54.338 --> 01:14:56.599]  Just killing everywhere.
[01:14:56.779 --> 01:14:58.280]  Oh, it's real good, folks.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:01.262]  Now they're saying they're going into Iran, by the way.
[01:15:02.157 --> 01:15:04.318]  Yeah, they're cooking up to this.
[01:15:04.438 --> 01:15:05.918]  I heard just Neil Bortz.
[01:15:06.718 --> 01:15:07.978]  I think he's from Atlanta.
[01:15:07.998 --> 01:15:09.199]  Total phony conservative.
[01:15:09.239 --> 01:15:14.820]  It's unbelievable how these people, they have to prompt them and tell them, hey, this is what you're going to say.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:22.922]  This Crystal yesterday took a sentence right out of a speech.
[01:15:23.002 --> 01:15:27.363]  It's in Dr. Monteith's book there, Brotherhood of Darkness, about...
[01:15:29.743 --> 01:15:31.564]  What a noble dream this is.
[01:15:31.604 --> 01:15:35.485]  And, of course, people are going to have to, there's a lot of money going to have to be spent and have to die.
[01:15:35.545 --> 01:15:38.306]  And that was, he gave that speech like 10 years ago.
[01:15:38.406 --> 01:15:40.886]  But Crystal used part of that.
[01:15:41.466 --> 01:15:44.227]  I mean, it was right out of the context, right out of there.
[01:15:44.727 --> 01:15:45.147]  Unbelievable.
[01:15:45.348 --> 01:15:49.529]  I just wanted to make a comment about this girl down in West Virginia.
[01:15:51.029 --> 01:15:57.411]  I almost got on Savage's show then, but about 20 minutes into it, they come on and they said, no, they couldn't let me on.
[01:15:57.967 --> 01:16:01.350]  But I wanted to disagree with him on what he was saying about this Jessica Lynch.
[01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:04.832]  But I wanted to ask him a question, and it's a question that I really want to ask.
[01:16:04.913 --> 01:16:09.216]  Because Jessica Lynch, I mean, she doesn't deserve all the things that have happened.
[01:16:09.276 --> 01:16:14.020]  And the real hero, the Hispanic gentleman who died, I mean, it's a lie.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:21.306]  Jessica Lynch, coward in fear, while people really fought to the death, got nothing because they want to show women as better than men in combat.
[01:16:21.646 --> 01:16:22.947]  Can I make a comment about this?
[01:16:23.327 --> 01:16:24.228]  Well, just make it right now.
[01:16:25.979 --> 01:16:34.567]  They have a father who I'm sure is in pain over his son's death, fighting and saying things about this Jessica Lynch.
[01:16:35.288 --> 01:16:37.870]  She has nothing to do with what's going on here.
[01:16:37.890 --> 01:16:38.411]  Well, I agree.
[01:16:38.451 --> 01:16:40.112]  I mean, I don't think she's bad, but she's a puppet.
[01:16:40.372 --> 01:16:40.753]  Stay there.
[01:16:42.329 --> 01:16:42.869]  We're good to go.

[01:19:19.394 --> 01:19:20.795]  Hi, Jack Browner with Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[01:19:46.152 --> 01:19:47.433]  Remember that ad from October of 2000?
[01:19:47.493 --> 01:19:50.396]  The NASDAQ was down 22% for the year?
[01:19:50.816 --> 01:19:52.177]  Well, it's since gone down another 40%.
[01:19:52.257 --> 01:19:54.479]  Folks, where will it bottom out?
[01:19:55.091 --> 01:19:55.591]  We're good to go.
[01:20:19.791 --> 01:20:20.692]  Call Midas today.
[01:20:20.712 --> 01:20:21.592]  800-686-2237.

[01:20:26.416 --> 01:20:29.058]  Downside risk is minimal in comparison to paper equities.
[01:20:29.398 --> 01:20:34.342]  The time to move to hard assets is now before the momentum buyers further escalate the prices.
[01:20:34.562 --> 01:20:35.943]  Protect your financial holdings.
[01:20:36.203 --> 01:20:37.624]  Call Midas Resources today.
[01:20:37.644 --> 01:20:37.684]  800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.157 --> 01:20:51.178]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:20:51.798 --> 01:20:54.799]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.701]  This is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.
[01:21:01.761 --> 01:21:06.202]  What endears people to the neocon fake talk show hosts who are the Judas Goats.
[01:21:06.922 --> 01:21:08.402]  The globalists are going to take America down.
[01:21:08.422 --> 01:21:12.803]  They've got to have a way to co-op real conservatives, constitutionalists, Christians, libertarians.
[01:21:13.570 --> 01:21:13.970]  We're good to go.
[01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.130]  I think?
[01:21:35.826 --> 01:21:40.828]  This Hispanic gentleman who fought to the death, he was the one that shot a bunch of Iraqis and got killed and bayoneted and all that.
[01:21:40.888 --> 01:21:41.288]  It's true.
[01:21:41.628 --> 01:21:43.709]  But they don't want to just show a man out there fighting.
[01:21:44.009 --> 01:21:45.110]  They wanted to tell the story.
[01:21:45.130 --> 01:21:46.090]  Remember the first few days?
[01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:53.133]  The Army said, yeah, she fought with a machine gun like Audie Murphy and kept fighting them as she'd been shot and they bayoneted her.
[01:21:53.513 --> 01:22:03.697]  They took what happened to the man that fought to the death, okay, when a bunch of the others tried to run, by the way, and they took what he did and said she did it.
[01:22:04.621 --> 01:22:07.784]  Because she's a woman, and the neocons want to destroy the military.
[01:22:08.365 --> 01:22:09.026]  It's that simple.
[01:22:10.087 --> 01:22:12.669]  And they want to draft everybody, so they've also got to get women in the military.
[01:22:12.689 --> 01:22:20.257]  That's another reason, of course, there'll be nothing more than camp prostitutes like General Hooker, to read the word hooker, had in the Civil War.
[01:22:21.438 --> 01:22:24.901]  And I'm sorry, folks, half the women that were in Baghdad have gotten pregnant now.
[01:22:25.081 --> 01:22:25.362]  Half of them.
[01:22:25.382 --> 01:22:25.642]  Half.
[01:22:25.662 --> 01:22:25.882]  Not 20%, not 40%.
[01:22:26.102 --> 01:22:26.423]  Half.
[01:22:30.564 --> 01:22:32.146]  So, it's a joke, okay?
[01:22:32.687 --> 01:22:33.147]  It's a joke.
[01:22:33.167 --> 01:22:39.194]  I don't want to spend all day on this, but you can have a neocon talk about this issue and how it's wrong, because that can make them sound conservative.
[01:22:39.434 --> 01:22:47.784]  They won't talk about the giant federal government, biggest it's ever been, loss of liberty, signing on to UNESCO, expanding Department of Education, Health and Human Services.
[01:22:48.144 --> 01:22:49.706]  Real quick, finish up, Charles.
[01:22:51.846 --> 01:22:53.866]  Some soldiers come back, they're spit on.
[01:22:54.126 --> 01:22:56.427]  Some soldiers come back, they're made millionaires.
[01:22:56.907 --> 01:22:58.087]  Who's responsible?
[01:22:58.407 --> 01:22:59.868]  It certainly isn't the soldiers.
[01:22:59.948 --> 01:23:01.088]  It's not this 19-year-old girl.
[01:23:01.128 --> 01:23:01.568]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:23:01.768 --> 01:23:02.868]  And I'm actually hurting.
[01:23:03.168 --> 01:23:05.269]  Savage shouldn't be attacking Lynch and her family.
[01:23:05.429 --> 01:23:07.589]  He should be attacking his God, George Bush.
[01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:08.129]  Thanks for the call.
[01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:09.090]  That's all I want.
[01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.710]  Thanks for the call.
[01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:10.910]  He should be attacking his God.
[01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:12.170]  Let's go ahead.
[01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:13.290]  It's like mental illness.
[01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:17.751]  You go, Clinton bad, Clinton evil, Hillary evil, evil.
[01:23:17.811 --> 01:23:19.212]  It's all the same thing on these shows.
[01:23:19.472 --> 01:23:20.692]  Yes, we know they're bad.
[01:23:21.232 --> 01:23:22.073]  But Bush, good.
[01:23:22.133 --> 01:23:23.094]  Bush, Bush, Bush.
[01:23:23.434 --> 01:23:24.695]  Bush, worse, folks.
[01:23:24.815 --> 01:23:26.456]  Bush, bad, bad, bad.
[01:23:28.498 --> 01:23:30.219]  Okay, people like movies and TV.
[01:23:30.239 --> 01:23:31.821]  That's why they use it to propagandize you.
[01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:33.262]  Let's use a Star Trek example.
[01:23:34.243 --> 01:23:34.563]  Okay?
[01:23:34.963 --> 01:23:39.127]  Bush is a Klingon bird of prey that's cloaked.
[01:23:40.128 --> 01:23:43.230]  Now, is that more dangerous than a Klingon ship that doesn't have a cloaking device?
[01:23:43.710 --> 01:23:45.412]  This is all I hear is movie examples.
[01:23:45.432 --> 01:23:46.693]  That's how they propagandize us.
[01:23:46.953 --> 01:23:47.894]  We'll just use those.
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:51.521]  That's exactly what we're dealing with here.
[01:23:53.062 --> 01:23:59.024]  And so Bush is running as a Trojan horse, folks, a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[01:23:59.044 --> 01:24:00.325]  What other analogy do you need?
[01:24:00.345 --> 01:24:03.166]  Now let's talk to Brett in Kansas.
[01:24:03.226 --> 01:24:03.907]  Brett, you're on the air.
[01:24:03.947 --> 01:24:04.327]  Go ahead.
[01:24:04.347 --> 01:24:05.708]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[01:24:06.148 --> 01:24:07.489]  Well, I got you on the air, my friend.
[01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:07.849]  Go ahead.
[01:24:07.909 --> 01:24:08.289]  All right.
[01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:16.493]  Yeah, I mean, I wanted to tell you about, like, you know, I did this, you know, rap and everything, you know, and it's war, spiritual warfare.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.711]  And I was in this Mexican fiesta here like June, and it was a bunch of cops standing around and everything.
[01:24:22.731 --> 01:24:26.018]  And, you know, me and my wife, you know, they was looking and everything.
[01:24:26.038 --> 01:24:28.543]  So I get up there, you know, talking deep, deep stuff.
[01:24:29.378 --> 01:24:30.439]  You know, they ain't ready for it.
[01:24:30.639 --> 01:24:33.560]  Okay, let me, let me, what you're saying is you were a speaker?
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:34.721]  Oh yeah, I'm a rap.
[01:24:35.301 --> 01:24:40.844]  At the event, and you got up and engaged in the First Amendment, and what did the commissariat do?
[01:24:41.084 --> 01:24:44.566]  Exactly, they started, you know, they huddled around first, right before I got on stage.
[01:24:44.626 --> 01:24:53.290]  Once I got on stage, they just split up in different groups, and after I got out, you know, saying what I was saying, you know, talking about how cops were at us and everything, and next thing you know,
[01:24:53.857 --> 01:24:55.457]  We're good to go.
[01:24:55.517 --> 01:24:56.018]  We're good to go.
[01:25:12.423 --> 01:25:13.164]  Like Saturday.
[01:25:13.524 --> 01:25:18.350]  You know, it talks about this UK ex-minister accuses US over September 11th.
[01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:20.873]  Yeah, that's the London Telegraph BBC.
[01:25:21.013 --> 01:25:21.514]  Exactly.
[01:25:21.574 --> 01:25:24.057]  I was just making sure, you know, that was something nice there, though.
[01:25:24.077 --> 01:25:25.619]  But, you know, it's getting out there.
[01:25:26.279 --> 01:25:29.143]  You know, the word is getting out there on how crooked they are, like I say.
[01:25:29.628 --> 01:25:33.732]  And I know, like I've been saying before, good versus evil, and this is the real good.
[01:25:33.792 --> 01:25:35.453]  Tell you what, Brett, stay there.
[01:25:35.473 --> 01:25:39.797]  I'm going to come back to you and then Scott and Dino and Vance, and that's going to be it for calls this hour.
[01:25:39.818 --> 01:25:45.122]  I'm going to cover news and then go back to calls in the next hour after Ron Paul will be on with us about 20, 30 minutes in the next hour.
[01:25:45.363 --> 01:25:47.024]  We'll put you on hold and let you finish up on the other side.
[01:25:47.364 --> 01:25:48.926]  I want to give you another analogy right now.
[01:25:50.507 --> 01:25:54.291]  It'd be like if you were in a town with a corrupt sheriff who worked for the railroad.
[01:25:55.627 --> 01:25:56.908]  And that's the history of the West.
[01:25:57.369 --> 01:26:02.853]  More often than not, they were just enforcers for whoever the fat cat was to take land and oppress the people.
[01:26:04.114 --> 01:26:08.657]  So if you were in a small town that had a corrupt sheriff and you were one of the deputies, let's say you're not even a bad guy.
[01:26:09.358 --> 01:26:13.141]  But you work for a corrupt, evil sheriff that works for the railroad.
[01:26:13.841 --> 01:26:17.444]  That's why Rhett is saying he denounces you.
[01:26:17.845 --> 01:26:20.867]  Because you haven't denounced your boss.
[01:26:21.724 --> 01:26:24.286]  Your boss is committing the biggest crimes around.
[01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:26.488]  Your boss is bringing in drugs.
[01:26:26.808 --> 01:26:28.850]  Your boss is destroying America.
[01:26:29.670 --> 01:26:32.132]  Renounce it or be considered as an aid to it.
[01:26:32.873 --> 01:26:33.793]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.254 --> 01:26:35.915]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.796 --> 01:26:39.478]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.763 --> 01:26:45.964]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:26:46.404 --> 01:26:50.745]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:26:51.025 --> 01:26:53.425]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold... 888-803-4438.
[01:26:53.445 --> 01:26:54.305]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:26:54.325 --> 01:26:55.666]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:26:55.706 --> 01:26:55.966]  See you.
[01:27:15.598 --> 01:27:20.062]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[01:27:20.302 --> 01:27:27.088]  And time and time again, we see the same paradigms.
[01:27:27.388 --> 01:27:29.630]  Time and time again, we see the same paradigms.
[01:27:31.772 --> 01:27:34.554]  So, those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[01:27:34.594 --> 01:27:36.376]  Again, I cannot stress that enough.
[01:27:37.307 --> 01:27:42.729]  And when you get a corrupt government, of course people that work for the government are going to rationalize that things aren't corrupt.
[01:27:42.809 --> 01:27:45.430]  Well, things could be better, but I'm just doing my job.
[01:27:45.490 --> 01:27:47.710]  We've got to protect this public from themselves.
[01:27:47.770 --> 01:27:50.711]  And sure, we're going to go ahead and take their rights, but things change.
[01:27:50.771 --> 01:27:53.372]  And don't you know you're selling out your birthright?
[01:27:53.392 --> 01:27:54.532]  You're selling out everything.
[01:27:56.213 --> 01:27:58.774]  Folks, I have made nine documentary films.
[01:27:59.394 --> 01:28:00.154]  I've written a book.
[01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:02.655]  I've published another great book written by Paul Watson.
[01:28:04.244 --> 01:28:06.825]  I've got two great t-shirts that wake people up.
[01:28:07.045 --> 01:28:12.728]  Everything I do is about waking people up to history, waking people up to the tyranny that we face right now.
[01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:19.431]  My night film is now out, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, two hours and 40 minutes.
[01:28:19.471 --> 01:28:29.436]  I mean, it's an education on the New World Order, on government-sponsored terror, on Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, government-run slavery rings, folks.
[01:28:30.296 --> 01:28:31.057]  Mainstream news.
[01:28:31.597 --> 01:28:33.298]  It's the stuff you never saw on the nightly news.
[01:28:34.682 --> 01:28:35.822]  Forced inoculations.
[01:28:36.003 --> 01:28:36.763]  All documented.
[01:28:37.243 --> 01:28:38.083]  Their own statements.
[01:28:38.744 --> 01:28:39.344]  Their own documents.
[01:28:39.364 --> 01:28:40.104]  Their own video clips.
[01:28:40.464 --> 01:28:41.985]  Telling us how good torture is.
[01:28:42.505 --> 01:28:44.045]  This thing is fast moving.
[01:28:44.626 --> 01:28:46.146]  I suggest you watch it in three parts.
[01:28:46.867 --> 01:28:48.447]  Police state three total enslavement.
[01:28:49.007 --> 01:28:50.328]  Two hours, 40 minutes long.
[01:28:51.448 --> 01:28:50.328]  $25.95.
[01:28:51.988 --> 01:28:53.449]  How could you not get the video?
[01:28:54.119 --> 01:28:54.399]  Get it.
[01:28:54.659 --> 01:28:55.240]  Make copies.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:29:00.603]  Give them to friends, family, county commissioners, talk show hosts, your police chief, sheriff's deputies.
[01:29:01.203 --> 01:29:01.864]  Educate them.
[01:29:02.084 --> 01:29:07.287]  A lot of people will wake up because no matter how horrible this is, they already have seen the pieces of the puzzle.
[01:29:07.567 --> 01:29:09.228]  They already have concerns deep down.
[01:29:09.688 --> 01:29:12.550]  And when they see it, they go, wow, yeah, they told us that at work.
[01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:14.211]  They told us that in the briefing.
[01:29:14.631 --> 01:29:15.651]  Man, that makes sense.
[01:29:15.672 --> 01:29:17.112]  I'm going to check out that document.
[01:29:17.332 --> 01:29:18.393]  They find out it's true.
[01:29:19.894 --> 01:29:20.834]  Take 911 the road to tyranny.
[01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:26.350]  About September 11th, a government-sponsored terror in the unfolding police state.
[01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:28.671]  I mean, I've got FEMA on tape in Kansas City.
[01:29:29.492 --> 01:29:30.932]  Firefighters sent it to us.
[01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:34.314]  And the training manual's on top of it from other parts of the country.
[01:29:34.334 --> 01:29:35.374]  It's not just this video.
[01:29:36.055 --> 01:29:38.616]  We have the news articles, the training manuals, video of it.
[01:29:40.136 --> 01:29:45.419]  They're in a classroom full of cops and firemen saying, quote, all Christians are terrorists, enemies of the government.
[01:29:45.999 --> 01:29:48.100]  Thomas Jefferson, George Washington are terrorists.
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:49.981]  So what if 10,000 have to die?
[01:29:52.398 --> 01:30:03.086]  And you see the cops all shuffling and moving around in their chairs as this FEMA, this Fed, this continuity of government spook is up there telling them this.
[01:30:03.586 --> 01:30:04.747]  And then we have the training manuals.
[01:30:04.827 --> 01:30:09.370]  Christians, gun owners, all those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:11.532]  Constitution or say they're defenders of the U.S.
[01:30:11.552 --> 01:30:12.132]  Constitution.
[01:30:12.312 --> 01:30:13.973]  The cops have sworn oaths to that.
[01:30:14.254 --> 01:30:16.095]  And this is all over the country.
[01:30:16.115 --> 01:30:21.839]  I would say training manuals from West Virginia to California to Texas to Illinois
[01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:23.323]  To Michigan.
[01:30:24.064 --> 01:30:24.784]  To Kansas.
[01:30:24.864 --> 01:30:25.564]  To Florida.
[01:30:27.185 --> 01:30:27.865]  To Georgia.
[01:30:28.005 --> 01:30:30.186]  I mean, folks, I got a box full of this stuff.
[01:30:33.048 --> 01:30:33.708]  It's crazy.
[01:30:35.369 --> 01:30:36.989]  The Washington Times wrote an article about it.
[01:30:37.570 --> 01:30:44.433]  The news that we'd covered and broken and others had covered and broken on this network called Constitutional Terrorists.
[01:30:44.453 --> 01:30:47.174]  And it just had links to the flyers, the training manuals, the statements.
[01:30:47.214 --> 01:30:48.775]  I mean, they're teaching them, folks.
[01:30:49.515 --> 01:30:51.936]  They're teaching them to walk you behind a building and blow your head off.
[01:30:55.123 --> 01:30:56.424]  And I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:30:57.325 --> 01:30:58.485]  I'm not going to go along with it.
[01:30:58.565 --> 01:31:08.212]  So if you want to do something about it and you want to support this show, call right now or write to us or go online and get the videos, get the books, get the tapes.
[01:31:08.773 --> 01:31:09.853]  They're so powerful.
[01:31:09.873 --> 01:31:10.814]  They're informing people.
[01:31:11.014 --> 01:31:12.035]  They're changing lives.
[01:31:13.246 --> 01:31:14.627]  Toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:14.647 --> 01:31:14.967]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:31:14.987 --> 01:31:17.068]  Or InfoWars.com or Net to order, or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:31:17.209 --> 01:31:17.449]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:17.469 --> 01:31:19.690]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100.
[01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:43.291]  Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:52.436]  Again, that's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, or 888-253-3139.
[01:31:53.076 --> 01:31:58.019]  And if you don't do anything, if you don't wake others up, they're not going to know what's happening.
[01:31:58.279 --> 01:32:00.740]  They're going to buy all this propaganda that's taking place.
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:02.261]  Now, I've got to go quick now.
[01:32:02.341 --> 01:32:09.765]  I've been holding callers and letting them talk a long time, which is important, but I've got to get everybody to get the rest of this news before Ron Paul comes on.
[01:32:09.785 --> 01:32:11.046]  Let's talk about the neocons.
[01:32:12.472 --> 01:32:19.453]  I know you may hate him because he's got a really conservative record on the Second Amendment and borders and against abortion and for sovereignty and against the U.N.
[01:32:19.993 --> 01:32:21.314]  I know it's not about action.
[01:32:21.354 --> 01:32:22.934]  It's about rhetoric for you neocons.
[01:32:22.994 --> 01:32:24.834]  But we love America.
[01:32:25.774 --> 01:32:29.035]  We're going to keep fighting for this country no matter what you trash do.
[01:32:30.155 --> 01:32:31.535]  You white trash neocons.
[01:32:31.555 --> 01:32:33.356]  And let me say something else on this subject.
[01:32:34.456 --> 01:32:36.236]  We're not going to stop and we're going to win.
[01:32:36.916 --> 01:32:41.757]  And you're going to pay for your crimes before a jury.
[01:32:42.549 --> 01:32:45.511]  You will be brought to justice, New World Order, because you didn't know when to quit.
[01:32:45.531 --> 01:32:46.892]  You had to have it all.
[01:32:47.452 --> 01:32:49.193]  Control of our minds and our families.
[01:32:49.334 --> 01:32:53.296]  It wasn't enough to run all the banks and Hollywood and the media.
[01:32:54.317 --> 01:32:54.877]  It wasn't enough.
[01:32:54.917 --> 01:33:00.361]  You wanted to put us in your presence and have us be slaves because you'd get off on it like every other thug in history has.
[01:33:01.241 --> 01:33:03.823]  And you're going to go the way of all the thugs and empires in history.
[01:33:03.963 --> 01:33:05.804]  You're going to destroy yourselves.
[01:33:07.646 --> 01:33:11.268]  That's what I say to all you thugs, all you goons, all of you.
[01:33:12.028 --> 01:33:13.969]  All right, real quick, Brett in Kansas.
[01:33:13.989 --> 01:33:14.449]  Finish up.
[01:33:16.951 --> 01:33:22.834]  Like I said, it's just, you know, man, I'm just really calling to let you know, you know, you got somebody else out here down too, man, you know.
[01:33:22.914 --> 01:33:24.595]  And like I say, I've been in gangs and all that.
[01:33:24.775 --> 01:33:26.156]  You know, I'm working for the Lord now.
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:28.480]  I'm taking this serious, you know what I'm saying?
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:28.840]  Good.
[01:33:29.281 --> 01:33:30.021]  And you know what I found?
[01:33:30.061 --> 01:33:36.862]  I found you can get people out of gangs or out of hippiedom or out of their phony conservatism or out of all these counterfeits.
[01:33:36.902 --> 01:33:40.803]  If you just tell them like it is about the New World Order, they'll straighten up and fly straight.
[01:33:40.843 --> 01:33:41.804]  Is that not what you found?
[01:33:42.164 --> 01:33:43.004]  Exactly.
[01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:45.824]  To see what it is, now I got a new single.
[01:33:45.864 --> 01:33:49.385]  You know, like I said, I'm going to send you one, man, but, you know, this is straight to the point.
[01:33:49.605 --> 01:33:56.467]  I mean, you know, and like I say, I just want to be able to get together with you one day, man, you know, us all.
[01:33:57.017 --> 01:33:58.118]  And do what we have to do, baby.
[01:33:58.138 --> 01:33:58.738]  It's happening.
[01:33:58.838 --> 01:33:59.659]  It's happening, my friend.
[01:33:59.679 --> 01:34:00.239]  Good to hear from you.
[01:34:00.279 --> 01:34:00.660]  Take care.
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:01.120]  All right.
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:01.620]  Take it easy.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:02.021]  You bet.
[01:34:02.061 --> 01:34:03.381]  Let's talk to Scott in New York.
[01:34:03.402 --> 01:34:04.142]  Go ahead, Scott.
[01:34:05.443 --> 01:34:06.804]  This is Scott here.
[01:34:07.725 --> 01:34:09.506]  Little Wild Listener, first-time caller.
[01:34:10.266 --> 01:34:10.607]  Welcome.
[01:34:12.348 --> 01:34:17.191]  The thing I want to ask you is something you mentioned a while back, not in the show today.
[01:34:17.211 --> 01:34:17.892]  It was a little bit back.
[01:34:17.912 --> 01:34:22.435]  You know, you're talking about these guys from the FBI and everything, and they're scared.
[01:34:22.855 --> 01:34:25.657]  Why don't they get, you know, if they're so scared, if they don't like what they're doing,
[01:34:25.953 --> 01:34:29.254]  Why don't they do what most intelligent people do is leave.
[01:34:29.314 --> 01:34:34.577]  The first thing you can do is say, I don't want to be part of this no more, and I'm not going to down the leave.
[01:34:34.597 --> 01:34:35.257]  Here's the problem.
[01:34:35.277 --> 01:34:36.417]  That's a catch-22.
[01:34:36.898 --> 01:34:37.438]  Here's the problem.
[01:34:37.458 --> 01:34:38.398]  That's a catch-22.
[01:34:38.999 --> 01:34:40.439]  Millions have left the military.
[01:34:40.539 --> 01:34:43.000]  Millions have left the FBI over the decades.
[01:34:43.601 --> 01:34:44.601]  They're all over the place.
[01:34:44.801 --> 01:34:49.203]  Millions have left law enforcement because they couldn't go along with it.
[01:34:50.353 --> 01:34:51.254]  And it's a catch-22.
[01:34:51.294 --> 01:34:57.259]  That's good because the good people aren't in there following these illegal orders, but at the same time, we don't have good people in there to watch over what's happening.
[01:34:57.639 --> 01:35:01.303]  And the Washington Times reported last year they're changing the law where felons can be in the military.
[01:35:01.683 --> 01:35:04.305]  Illegal aliens are going to make up the majority of the military.
[01:35:04.765 --> 01:35:08.909]  Russians and Mexicans and people that grew up under tyranny that think it's all normal.
[01:35:09.489 --> 01:35:14.551]  So that's the problem, is that they really are making up an army like Stalin has.
[01:35:14.611 --> 01:35:15.151]  Yes, they are.
[01:35:16.012 --> 01:35:20.894]  Well, my family has been either military, police, or military and police.
[01:35:22.775 --> 01:35:25.656]  My people have been here ever since before this was a country.
[01:35:27.337 --> 01:35:29.137]  And I'm just, you know, it's driving me nuts.
[01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:35.460]  And one thing I'm going to be doing, I'm still working on format, but I'm going to be getting my own radio show
[01:35:37.521 --> 01:35:42.467]  Another thing I'm going to be doing either this week or next week is I'm going to be ordering all your tapes.
[01:35:42.607 --> 01:35:46.692]  And I was just wondering, can you get them all on DVD or is it just tapes?
[01:35:46.833 --> 01:35:49.356]  No, I've only put Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[01:35:50.217 --> 01:35:54.663]  And all the others are on VHS because it's easier to copy them that way.
[01:35:55.427 --> 01:36:01.770]  And still more people have VHS machines than DVD players, despite the fact they're trying to move us over to DVD.
[01:36:02.230 --> 01:36:05.611]  But I'm going to put stuff in the future on DVD.
[01:36:05.932 --> 01:36:13.415]  And another thing I want to ask is, now I've got to wait for a little while.
[01:36:13.515 --> 01:36:14.175]  I'm back now.
[01:36:15.155 --> 01:36:23.259]  And another thing I want to ask you is, I need information on how to give information to AM stations, because I think I have a local station here.
[01:36:28.113 --> 01:36:34.454]  Well, if you're listening on Internet, satellite or shortwave, and there's not an AM or FM in your area, if there is, support them.
[01:36:34.514 --> 01:36:34.934]  Promote them.
[01:36:35.594 --> 01:36:36.454]  Tell them things about them.
[01:36:36.514 --> 01:36:41.856]  But if no one's picking us up, call the mom and pops, call the privately owned stations.
[01:36:41.916 --> 01:36:47.257]  Do not waste your time on CBS or on Clear Channel.
[01:36:47.277 --> 01:36:48.597]  I know, that's a waste.
[01:36:48.797 --> 01:36:50.657]  Sir, that is owned by the military.
[01:36:50.697 --> 01:36:53.838]  That is owned by the military industrial complex.
[01:36:54.651 --> 01:36:58.773]  I think it's a local... I have a station right in the city where I am.
[01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:00.453]  I don't think it's owned by Clear Channel.
[01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:03.555]  We've got three affiliates in the state of New York, and we need more.
[01:37:04.495 --> 01:37:06.216]  You have three affiliates in the state of New York?
[01:37:06.236 --> 01:37:07.236]  Yeah, they're in upstate New York.
[01:37:07.896 --> 01:37:08.137]  Really?
[01:37:08.957 --> 01:37:09.697]  Sir, just do this.
[01:37:10.017 --> 01:37:20.562]  Tell the station about GCNlive.com, and they have the different satellites we have to offer, the different shows, show times, refeeds, all that.
[01:37:20.922 --> 01:37:22.082]  GCNlive.com.
[01:37:22.522 --> 01:37:23.603]  Okay, yeah, because I'm...
[01:37:24.373 --> 01:37:27.896]  Do you have the call numbers for those?
[01:37:27.916 --> 01:37:28.917]  Sir, those are on the site.
[01:37:29.117 --> 01:37:29.798]  Those are on the site.
[01:37:29.998 --> 01:37:31.960]  Okay, yeah, I don't have the Internet.
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:34.522]  Well, you can just tell them about it, or you can go to the library.
[01:37:34.762 --> 01:37:35.503]  I've got to let you go.
[01:37:35.523 --> 01:37:37.464]  Good to hear from you.
[01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:38.045]  You take care.
[01:37:38.105 --> 01:37:38.865]  Thank you for the call.
[01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:40.006]  Really appreciate it.
[01:37:40.447 --> 01:37:40.887]  Keep it up.
[01:37:41.187 --> 01:37:42.068]  Dino in New York.
[01:37:42.088 --> 01:37:42.789]  Go ahead, Dino.
[01:37:43.365 --> 01:37:44.606]  Hey, Alex, keep the good work.
[01:37:44.666 --> 01:37:45.587]  Listen, a couple of things.
[01:37:45.627 --> 01:37:50.791]  You're talking about a guy who took a retirement, law enforcement, who knows about the good and bad.
[01:37:50.811 --> 01:37:54.353]  A lot of things were going on that was against my Christian values, and I just couldn't stand it anymore.
[01:37:54.813 --> 01:37:55.854]  Here's what I want to tell you about it.
[01:37:55.874 --> 01:37:56.295]  It's true.
[01:37:57.075 --> 01:37:57.956]  You're law enforcement.
[01:37:58.096 --> 01:37:59.197]  We keep a clean background.
[01:37:59.217 --> 01:38:01.458]  You've done everything right, including driving and wrecking criminals.
[01:38:01.478 --> 01:38:02.119]  They don't want you.
[01:38:02.299 --> 01:38:04.641]  They want crooks and criminals because it's controlled better.
[01:38:05.862 --> 01:38:11.666]  Listen, I had one of the top federal marshals in Texas 12 years ago tell me that.
[01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:15.772]  And tell me never to get involved in law enforcement because it was criminal.
[01:38:15.792 --> 01:38:17.913]  That was when I was in college, one of my dad's friends.
[01:38:18.613 --> 01:38:21.054]  They admit over 100 IQ won't hire you.
[01:38:21.535 --> 01:38:21.955]  Exactly.
[01:38:21.995 --> 01:38:22.375]  It's true.
[01:38:22.395 --> 01:38:24.016]  And none of that, too.
[01:38:24.036 --> 01:38:25.116]  They don't just want crooks.
[01:38:25.156 --> 01:38:26.137]  They want bullies.
[01:38:26.617 --> 01:38:27.017]  Exactly.
[01:38:27.057 --> 01:38:27.778]  They want bullies.
[01:38:27.858 --> 01:38:35.202]  And this is the reason why the citizens wonder, next time you hear about a shooting, why an off-duty cop shot somebody in a bar and got an argument with their neighbor.
[01:38:35.542 --> 01:38:38.143]  This is the loose cannon they want in law enforcement.
[01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:40.094]  Male or female.
[01:38:40.154 --> 01:38:42.856]  I mean, this is what's going on now in the community.
[01:38:43.056 --> 01:38:52.683]  And now all the 18, 16-year-old guys and girls are watching shows like the Threat Matrix that's going to be on ABC where they torture people every episode.
[01:38:52.883 --> 01:38:53.904]  Where torture is good.
[01:38:53.924 --> 01:38:54.945]  I mean, that's so sick.
[01:38:55.698 --> 01:38:55.938]  It is.
[01:38:56.058 --> 01:38:57.359]  And here's something interesting.
[01:38:57.719 --> 01:39:01.440]  Back when I went to the police academy, this was going back about 20 years ago, it was interesting.
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:07.643]  They were teaching us that if you use a necessary force, abuse people and torture them, you've got a civil rights violation.
[01:39:07.663 --> 01:39:10.304]  The FBI investigates you for civil rights.
[01:39:10.924 --> 01:39:13.805]  Also, another thing, too, the other day, of all places, I was in Walmart.
[01:39:14.426 --> 01:39:22.369]  I was in Walmart, two young off-duty, not off-duty, they were on-duty detectives, plain clothes, you know, the khakis with the combat boots and the polo shirts.
[01:39:22.796 --> 01:39:28.444]  They got their 9mm sticking out on their hip, like walking down, striking like peacocks, like I'm somebody.
[01:39:28.724 --> 01:39:29.625]  Here's the strange thing.
[01:39:29.966 --> 01:39:33.911]  Years ago, the cops used to be taught, you try to keep your weapon covered or protected.
[01:39:33.951 --> 01:39:39.078]  The way they were, all you gotta do is get a good couple bunch of criminals who weren't interested in that store,
[01:39:39.542 --> 01:39:40.363]  Just need two of them.
[01:39:40.623 --> 01:39:43.065]  Take each one of them out in a stranglehold and grab their weapon.
[01:39:43.105 --> 01:39:45.227]  I don't know what they're teaching these people nowadays.
[01:39:45.247 --> 01:39:47.548]  They don't care about intimidating the criminals.
[01:39:47.609 --> 01:39:52.653]  It's about intimidating a little old lady when they snatch their purse and ask it forward to seizure.
[01:39:52.673 --> 01:39:53.413]  Thanks for the call, Dino.
[01:39:53.453 --> 01:39:53.914]  All right.
[01:39:54.134 --> 01:39:54.874]  Good to hear from you.
[01:39:54.934 --> 01:39:55.975]  Vance in Georgia.
[01:39:55.995 --> 01:39:56.656]  Go ahead, Vance.
[01:39:57.917 --> 01:39:58.697]  Hey, Alex.
[01:39:58.818 --> 01:39:59.418]  Very quickly.
[01:39:59.458 --> 01:40:00.459]  I know we've got to hurry.
[01:40:00.879 --> 01:40:05.483]  I work for one of the big radio station companies in the country.
[01:40:06.059 --> 01:40:08.781]  And we had on our AM station this morning the U.S.
[01:40:09.021 --> 01:40:10.122]  attorney for the state.
[01:40:10.623 --> 01:40:14.266]  And, of course... Tell them how great the Patriot Act is on the orders from Ashcroft.
[01:40:14.626 --> 01:40:16.407]  Yes, Ashcroft had to send his opinions out.
[01:40:16.487 --> 01:40:21.311]  Well, he had these bullet points that he was reading, and I was on the show, and I was talking to him about it.
[01:40:22.232 --> 01:40:31.299]  And a couple of things that bothered me, what he said, was he was talking about, well, wiretaps have existed since the 70s and all this stuff, the mob and all this stuff.
[01:40:31.319 --> 01:40:33.000]  And I said, well, that doesn't make him right.
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:34.621]  He said, well, right or wrong, it doesn't matter.
[01:40:34.682 --> 01:40:35.162]  It's legal.
[01:40:35.988 --> 01:40:37.469]  Look, this is unlimited.
[01:40:38.009 --> 01:40:43.312]  This is blanket taps for phones, everything all over the place, with Echelon watching us.
[01:40:43.732 --> 01:40:44.812]  It's secret arrest.
[01:40:45.493 --> 01:40:48.474]  The definition of terrorism, did you hit him with the definition of terrorism?
[01:40:48.834 --> 01:40:56.178]  And I also talked to him about, I was talking to him about the Patriot Act and the Victory Act that was coming up.
[01:40:56.278 --> 01:40:57.539]  He didn't want to talk about any of that.
[01:40:57.599 --> 01:40:58.999]  I'm here to talk about the Patriot Act.
[01:40:59.059 --> 01:41:04.522]  And another thing that he said was, well, if you don't like big law enforcement, you're not going to like the Patriot Act.
[01:41:04.841 --> 01:41:06.442]  Pretty much another term for police state.
[01:41:06.522 --> 01:41:07.382]  Big law enforcement.
[01:41:09.003 --> 01:41:09.723]  Oh, yeah, big.
[01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:10.624]  Hey, man, the new boss.
[01:41:10.644 --> 01:41:12.425]  We're all going to be slaves, just like Russia.
[01:41:13.145 --> 01:41:16.127]  So did you ever stand up to this guy, or would you lose your job if you did?
[01:41:16.807 --> 01:41:18.048]  Well, the whole time I was.
[01:41:18.088 --> 01:41:19.388]  I mean, I'm the kook around here anywhere.
[01:41:19.428 --> 01:41:24.651]  I'm the patriotic guy, and I talk about it on my radio show, which I work for a rock station, which I don't know how long that's going to last.
[01:41:25.791 --> 01:41:30.174]  But I inform people, and I hope you don't mind if on our website I link to Infowars.com.
[01:41:30.274 --> 01:41:32.555]  I hope you do, sir, and I hope you have me on the show.
[01:41:33.366 --> 01:41:34.127]  I would love to.
[01:41:34.187 --> 01:41:36.709]  If I can get a talk format going, I would love to.
[01:41:36.749 --> 01:41:41.532]  And also, I just want to tell everybody... Well, your talk format, you had this liar on.
[01:41:41.552 --> 01:41:45.195]  Yeah, well, that was our sister station, our talk station.
[01:41:45.235 --> 01:41:46.776]  I worked for a rock station.
[01:41:46.876 --> 01:41:48.918]  Oh, so you were over there debating and doing that.
[01:41:48.978 --> 01:41:49.898]  Yes, yes.
[01:41:50.059 --> 01:41:52.360]  And apparently I'm the only one that will.
[01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:53.641]  I understand crossover, yeah.
[01:41:54.142 --> 01:41:58.345]  And I got to tell you, too, tell everybody that's listening, 9-1-1 is a great video.
[01:41:58.585 --> 01:41:59.165]  Great video.
[01:41:59.766 --> 01:42:00.907]  Thank you, Vance, but...
[01:42:01.835 --> 01:42:04.637]  Look, Ashcroft said there was no Patriot Act II.
[01:42:04.717 --> 01:42:05.677]  Now he says there is.
[01:42:06.098 --> 01:42:07.338]  That's what you've got to hit him with.
[01:42:07.659 --> 01:42:15.383]  Why did Ashcroft lie before the House and Senate and say there is no new terror act, period, after it had been introduced for four months?
[01:42:15.703 --> 01:42:16.624]  He is a liar.
[01:42:17.084 --> 01:42:18.185]  That's what you've got to hit him with.
[01:42:18.385 --> 01:42:21.427]  But he said if you don't like big law enforcement, you won't like this.
[01:42:21.667 --> 01:42:22.608]  I mean, how sick is that?
[01:42:22.808 --> 01:42:23.968]  I thought it was for terror.
[01:42:24.189 --> 01:42:25.609]  See, now it's big law enforcement.
[01:42:25.689 --> 01:42:26.490]  Fight crime.
[01:42:26.730 --> 01:42:28.071]  Notice how they say crime now.
[01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:32.404]  Anything else, Vance?
[01:42:33.905 --> 01:42:34.946]  All right, Vance is gone.
[01:42:35.626 --> 01:42:38.047]  One last caller, and I'm going to hit some news before we end this hour.
[01:42:39.088 --> 01:42:41.169]  Let's go ahead and talk to Manuel in Pennsylvania.
[01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.889]  Go ahead, Manuel.
[01:42:44.751 --> 01:42:46.132]  Okay, Julie in Rhode Island.
[01:42:46.172 --> 01:42:47.412]  Sounds like we had some phone problems.
[01:42:47.452 --> 01:42:48.153]  Go ahead, Julie.
[01:42:50.754 --> 01:42:51.895]  Got a problem with that one, too.
[01:42:53.212 --> 01:42:55.073]  Here on the Chuck Yeager radio program.
[01:42:56.053 --> 01:42:57.334]  Just test pilot a radio.
[01:42:57.974 --> 01:42:58.274]  I don't know.
[01:42:58.314 --> 01:42:59.255]  We won't take any more calls.
[01:42:59.295 --> 01:42:59.735]  How's that?
[01:43:00.135 --> 01:43:01.736]  We'll just suspend them for the rest of the day.
[01:43:02.836 --> 01:43:04.337]  Okay, no, we're not going to suspend calls.
[01:43:04.357 --> 01:43:10.920]  We'll figure out what's going on with the phone system and get back to folks later in the next hour with Ron Paul since we've seen some calls.
[01:43:12.941 --> 01:43:17.683]  Got a bunch of different news items here that I need to go over, but here's just some of the stuff.
[01:43:18.804 --> 01:43:19.824]  Headline the star.
[01:43:20.945 --> 01:43:21.205]  Okay?
[01:43:21.866 --> 01:43:22.186]  The U.S.
[01:43:22.206 --> 01:43:23.927]  is out to create a global police state.
[01:43:24.107 --> 01:43:35.210]  As part of the war on terror, the United States is pressuring other countries and its own citizens to accept invasions of privacy in the name of law enforcement, two human rights groups reported on Friday.
[01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:36.850]  And it gets into all that.
[01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:41.552]  Bush says he needs $87 billion more in the war on terror.
[01:43:41.672 --> 01:43:49.154]  And, of course, that means for the takeover of Iraq and for those contracts to be paid directly into his bank accounts and into the...
[01:43:50.590 --> 01:43:51.151]  We're good to go.
[01:43:51.171 --> 01:43:51.571]  We're good to go.
[01:43:51.611 --> 01:43:52.111]  We're good to go.
[01:44:10.535 --> 01:44:13.176]  Police seek DNA record of everyone.
[01:44:13.216 --> 01:44:21.278]  Senior police officers will call this weekend for the national database of 2 million DNA samples to be extended to everyone in the country.
[01:44:21.698 --> 01:44:29.420]  Kevin Morris, chairman of the Police Superintendents Association, said its annual conference would urge the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, to debate the issue.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:35.861]  He said a compulsory database would enable the police to solve crimes more quickly and prevent them from happening.
[01:44:35.881 --> 01:44:39.422]  And then, of course, have your blood sample to frame you whenever they want.
[01:44:40.396 --> 01:44:41.477]  Forgot that little part.
[01:44:41.857 --> 01:44:43.539]  We're just going to trust the government here to do this.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:48.323]  I also want to get into London could be evacuated if attacked.
[01:44:48.363 --> 01:44:49.664]  They admit concentration camps.
[01:44:49.684 --> 01:44:50.305]  We'll get to that.
[01:44:51.606 --> 01:44:54.408]  Also, Asia debt withdrawal, threat to U.S.
[01:44:54.448 --> 01:44:54.848]  deficit.
[01:44:54.869 --> 01:44:57.451]  If they pull and dump their bonds, we're in deep trouble.
[01:44:58.412 --> 01:45:02.155]  And I've got a bunch of other vital news on the other side of this break, so stay with us.
[01:45:03.704 --> 01:45:09.048]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:45:09.188 --> 01:45:17.415]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:45:17.675 --> 01:45:26.321]  Medical Corps potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[01:45:26.401 --> 01:45:32.346]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:45:32.566 --> 01:45:33.507]  We're good to go.
[01:45:53.985 --> 01:45:56.686]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:45:56.906 --> 01:45:58.226]  The New World Order.
[01:46:18.810 --> 01:46:20.453]  You will lose your liberty
[01:46:33.490 --> 01:46:37.934]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:48:08.564 --> 01:48:10.466]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:48:10.946 --> 01:48:13.728]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:13.748 --> 01:48:20.513]  All right, folks, we've got Ron Paul coming up in about six minutes, seven minutes or so.
[01:48:20.993 --> 01:48:22.595]  We all know this for, I don't know, 20, 30 minutes.
[01:48:22.875 --> 01:48:25.177]  And then I'm going to get back into more news and more calls.
[01:48:25.277 --> 01:48:28.119]  Right now, though, I really should have spent more time on this.
[01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:32.591]  Metcher allegations over September 11th.
[01:48:32.791 --> 01:48:34.251]  Monstrous, says U.S.
[01:48:34.371 --> 01:48:39.452]  Know what the illegitimate government, the parasitic government did that controls America is monstrous.
[01:48:40.192 --> 01:48:40.932]  Killing those people.
[01:48:41.253 --> 01:48:51.415]  Michael Metcher, one of Tony Blair's longest-serving ministers until earlier this year, sparked outrage yesterday by suggesting the United States government deliberately allowed the terrorist attacks of September 11th to take place.
[01:48:52.535 --> 01:48:54.696]  Mr. Metcher said the attacks, in which at least 3,000 people died...
[01:48:56.889 --> 01:48:57.389]  We're good to go.
[01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:58.350]  We're good to go.
[01:49:20.334 --> 01:49:23.616]  And Mr. Metra listed a number of reports detailing intelligence that the U.S.
[01:49:23.656 --> 01:49:26.939]  was said to have warned of the September 11th attacks.
[01:49:26.959 --> 01:49:33.863]  He questioned why military jets were not sent to intercept the hijacked passenger aircraft on the morning of the outrage two years ago.
[01:49:33.883 --> 01:49:38.346]  And he says, was the government, did they order them to deliberately stand down?
[01:49:39.467 --> 01:49:40.388]  Yeah, of course they did.
[01:49:40.548 --> 01:49:46.452]  That's come out, by the way, in some hearings, and the government all freaked out and tried to classify those transcripts in open hearings.
[01:49:47.352 --> 01:49:49.714]  Member of Parliament for Oldham...
[01:49:50.888 --> 01:50:08.736]  Cited a document called Rebuilding America's Defenses, written in September 2000 by a neoconservative think tank project for New American Century, which was set up by the group that included Dick Cheney, the American Vice President, Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary, and Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Defense Secretary, which he called the blueprint for world domination.
[01:50:10.077 --> 01:50:19.661]  He said the document stated that making America's tomorrow's dominant force would be a long process without some catalyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor.
[01:50:21.764 --> 01:50:25.466]  And they talked about how it'll be for a national draft, fascistic control of everything.
[01:50:25.807 --> 01:50:27.868]  The article goes on and on.
[01:50:27.928 --> 01:50:40.496]  We covered PNAC, folks, before September 11th, how the globalists were on the news, the CFR people going, there's going to be big attacks, we're going to take all your rights, this will energize the empire.
[01:50:42.074 --> 01:50:44.015]  I mean, this is scary, folks.
[01:50:44.555 --> 01:50:45.035]  But you know what?
[01:50:45.055 --> 01:51:03.539]  It doesn't matter if the globalists told us what they were going to do beforehand because they've got people like Lionel Chetwin who's got a made-for-TV movie, a docudrama that's going to air on one of the big three networks this week where Bush is this big savior and has so much courage on September 11th.
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:05.300]  It's like all these other shows.
[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:09.561]  They're total and complete massive propaganda.
[01:51:12.072 --> 01:51:12.752]  Look at this article.
[01:51:12.792 --> 01:51:14.293]  Terror plan to empty London.
[01:51:14.733 --> 01:51:19.796]  Dramatic plans for the mass evacuation of London in the event of a major terrorist attack have been announced by the government.
[01:51:20.996 --> 01:51:32.362]  And it says here they include herding Londoners and the rest of the population of other cities to rest in reception areas for medium or long term.
[01:51:33.311 --> 01:51:33.872]  There's another one.
[01:51:33.972 --> 01:51:35.974]  Asian debt withdrawal threat to U.S.
[01:51:36.034 --> 01:51:36.514]  deficit.
[01:51:36.794 --> 01:51:43.421]  Financial Times of London economists fear that Asia's investors, who are the largest foreign owners of U.S.
[01:51:43.441 --> 01:51:45.743]  treasuries, may cut their holdings of U.S.
[01:51:45.783 --> 01:51:51.629]  government debt, withdrawing a key source of financing for America's large current account deficit.
[01:51:51.949 --> 01:51:54.792]  The worries have been fueled by recent sharp falls in the price of U.S.
[01:51:54.812 --> 01:51:56.794]  government debt, or the dollar.
[01:51:58.374 --> 01:52:00.956]  And they tell you that the drop in the dollar is good, folks.
[01:52:01.176 --> 01:52:04.978]  All we've got left is that dirty Federal Reserve private currency.
[01:52:05.558 --> 01:52:07.980]  But they're going to pull it out from under you on purpose.
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:22.228]  But don't worry, there'll be a terrorist attack that accompanies it, so you'll have a government job as a draftee, digging ditches, working in factories, working in fields, and all the local commissariat and thug mayors and police chiefs will be over you.
[01:52:23.146 --> 01:52:26.447]  You'll learn how to worship them properly, like they did in Russia.
[01:52:27.007 --> 01:52:28.647]  Oh, yes, I've seen their documents.
[01:52:28.767 --> 01:52:29.307]  I've read them.
[01:52:29.487 --> 01:52:34.188]  They're planted across between China, Russia, and Nazi Germany.
[01:52:35.188 --> 01:52:36.509]  Complete with everything.
[01:52:38.369 --> 01:52:42.630]  Stars from Ron Paul are scheduled up next with us in the third hour.
[01:52:42.650 --> 01:52:44.950]  If your station doesn't carry the third hour, they really should.
[01:52:46.731 --> 01:52:47.031]  All right.
[01:52:47.271 --> 01:52:50.032]  Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are the websites.
[01:52:50.052 --> 01:52:51.432]  A lot more coming up.
[01:52:51.512 --> 01:52:52.212]  Stay with us.
[01:52:53.846 --> 01:52:54.446]  Hello, folks.
[01:52:54.466 --> 01:52:55.487]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:52:55.827 --> 01:53:01.571]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:53:01.812 --> 01:53:10.618]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from water... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.264 --> 01:53:19.905]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.585 --> 01:53:21.626]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.347 --> 01:53:23.508]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:24.929]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.690 --> 01:53:26.591]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.252 --> 01:53:30.895]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.435 --> 01:53:35.519]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:49.151 --> 01:53:51.052]  Alright folks, we're into the third hour.
[01:53:51.072 --> 01:53:56.435]  I'm Alex Jones, blasting out coast to coast on a growing list of AM and FM affiliates.
[01:53:56.955 --> 01:53:59.837]  Global shortwave and the internet at infowars.com and net.
[01:54:01.338 --> 01:54:08.221]  And I am scheduled here in the next few minutes to have Congressman Ron Paul on to talk about the neocons, the war, the economy.
[01:54:08.241 --> 01:54:10.242]  We're going to talk about all the different issues.
[01:54:12.263 --> 01:54:15.085]  And so this should be quite informative.
[01:54:16.391 --> 01:54:20.654]  And my ISDN lines have been going up and down, which only seems to happen during key interviews like this one.
[01:54:20.694 --> 01:54:25.878]  So we'll see what happens with my connection from here in Austin with the PSYOPs, folks.
[01:54:26.159 --> 01:54:30.182]  And I hope they can just keep us connected up in Minnesota.
[01:54:31.623 --> 01:54:37.968]  But, hey, that's what it's all about, folks, engaging the New World Order at point-blank range in the information war.
[01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:47.556]  Now, we covered a lot of different news items in the last hour, and one of the most important was Asian debt withdrawal threat to U.S.
[01:54:47.736 --> 01:54:48.276]  deficit.
[01:54:49.277 --> 01:54:58.984]  And they talked about how Asia and Europe and the Russians and especially Japan are moving to dump the Treasury bills that they've been buying.
[01:54:59.750 --> 01:55:01.150]  And if that happens, we're in deep trouble.
[01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:05.732]  Economists fear that Asian investors, who are the largest foreign owners of U.S.
[01:55:05.752 --> 01:55:07.572]  Treasuries, may cut their holdings of U.S.
[01:55:07.952 --> 01:55:14.714]  government debt, withdrawing a key source of financing for America's large current account deficit.
[01:55:15.194 --> 01:55:18.575]  The worries have been fueled by recent sharp rises in the price of U.S.
[01:55:18.595 --> 01:55:20.236]  government debt, weakness in the U.S.
[01:55:20.256 --> 01:55:24.917]  Treasury market that make Asian investors less willing buyers of debt securities to
[01:55:25.911 --> 01:55:29.233]  Said the head of the G-10 foreign exchange strategy at Merrill Lynch.
[01:55:29.273 --> 01:55:37.877]  He said that there had already been a noticeable shift downwards in the amount of debt issued by mortgage financiers and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae being bought by foreign investors.
[01:55:40.278 --> 01:55:41.098]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:55:41.138 --> 01:55:44.380]  Now, we're about to break here in a few minutes, and we're going to come back with Ron Paul.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:52.644]  We're going to go to him right now, and we're going to get into the economy, into the war, into Bush saying last night he wants $87 billion more for the war on terror.
[01:55:53.715 --> 01:55:56.676]  And also I want to talk about his powerful neocon speech he gave.
[01:55:56.936 --> 01:55:58.497]  Congressman, great to have you on the show, sir.
[01:55:58.717 --> 01:55:59.157]  Thank you.
[01:55:59.197 --> 01:55:59.818]  Good to be with you.
[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:05.980]  Hello.
[01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:07.741]  Congressman, I apologize for this.
[01:56:07.781 --> 01:56:08.821]  I'm unable to hear you.
[01:56:09.241 --> 01:56:09.842]  You do hear me?
[01:56:10.182 --> 01:56:11.342]  Oh, I can now.
[01:56:11.782 --> 01:56:12.163]  Okay.
[01:56:12.263 --> 01:56:13.303]  Thank you so much.
[01:56:13.563 --> 01:56:14.644]  Please start over again.
[01:56:15.484 --> 01:56:15.824]  Okay.
[01:56:15.944 --> 01:56:20.086]  I said it's nice to be with you today, and I hope you can hear me.
[01:56:20.486 --> 01:56:21.046]  I can now.
[01:56:21.146 --> 01:56:21.927]  Thank you, sir.
[01:56:24.406 --> 01:56:26.727]  What do you think of the President's speech last night?
[01:56:27.987 --> 01:56:31.668]  Well, I guess there wasn't anything in there that I didn't expect.
[01:56:31.708 --> 01:56:33.349]  Of course, the money is outrageous.
[01:56:33.389 --> 01:56:34.949]  The policies are lousy.
[01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:46.353]  But the one thing that I noticed in it that probably bothered me the most was he didn't even resort to saying that we went to Iraq for national security reasons.
[01:56:46.393 --> 01:56:49.934]  We didn't go to Iraq because of authority from the Congress.
[01:56:51.099 --> 01:57:00.647]  He had to go to Iraq to enforce UN resolutions that the UN themselves wouldn't enforce, but he was doing the duty of the United Nations.
[01:57:01.348 --> 01:57:04.931]  Now, if that isn't a mixed bag, I don't know what could be.
[01:57:05.771 --> 01:57:07.192]  Well, it's amazing propaganda.
[01:57:07.212 --> 01:57:09.113]  He needs $87 billion more.
[01:57:09.133 --> 01:57:15.736]  They've already spilt our blood and spilt our funds, but they've already spent a lot more than that.
[01:57:16.036 --> 01:57:19.078]  And now they're talking about a five- to ten-year occupation, Congressman.
[01:57:19.458 --> 01:57:22.139]  Yeah, it could be literally hundreds of billions.
[01:57:22.219 --> 01:57:29.883]  And, you know, there were approximately three people in the administration that talked about this before the war, and they were all fired.
[01:57:30.603 --> 01:57:33.125]  You know, the people who warned how much money it would cost.
[01:57:33.145 --> 01:57:33.185]  So...
[01:57:35.401 --> 01:57:38.602]  This is not like... They act like they're surprised.
[01:57:39.543 --> 01:57:41.884]  They said, well, it didn't work out exactly as we thought.
[01:57:41.924 --> 01:57:43.205]  We didn't anticipate this.
[01:57:43.785 --> 01:57:58.553]  But there were many on record for saying you ought to be careful, not only because it didn't make sense going there for moral and national security reasons, but because there were too many unintended consequences that could occur, and the possibilities existed there.
[01:57:58.573 --> 01:57:59.713]  Congressman, we've got a break.
[01:57:59.733 --> 01:58:00.274]  Stay right there.
[01:58:00.294 --> 01:58:00.954]  We're honored to have you.
[01:58:00.974 --> 01:58:02.795]  Congressman Ron Paul from right here in Texas.
[01:58:03.704 --> 01:58:08.455]  And I'm proud to have him as, well, he's not my congressman, but his district comes right up close to my doorstep.
[01:58:08.796 --> 01:58:11.682]  We'll be right back with a bunch of other key points from Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:58:15.351 --> 01:58:24.317]  Offered for the first time on GCN, the Capitol Hill Directory, Congress at Your Fingertips gives you all the pertinent information for every member of the House and Senate for the 108th Congress.
[01:58:24.337 --> 01:58:32.443]  This includes websites for congressmen, telephone, fax numbers, email, biographical data, up-to-date photos of members, committees, district offices, and more.
[01:58:32.483 --> 01:58:45.091]  This 206-page spiral-bound booklet, Congress at Your Fingertips, also has sections on the White House, the Cabinet, selected agencies, the Supreme Court, and members, the Senate leadership, the House leadership, how to write your congressmen and their staff, state delegations, and governors.
[01:58:45.551 --> 01:58:46.431]  We're good to go.
[01:59:15.689 --> 01:59:18.612]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:59:19.293 --> 01:59:20.594]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:59:20.774 --> 01:59:26.540]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:32.085]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:59:32.366 --> 01:59:36.470]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:59:36.650 --> 01:59:40.454]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:59:40.714 --> 01:59:45.358]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:59:45.438 --> 01:59:51.704]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:59:51.744 --> 01:59:53.566]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:00:11.772 --> 02:00:13.833]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:00:14.827 --> 02:00:25.554]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:00:25.734 --> 02:00:33.318]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:00:33.598 --> 02:00:36.720]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:42.684]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:00:43.004 --> 02:00:49.166]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:00:49.506 --> 02:00:53.407]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:00:53.467 --> 02:00:55.348]  The water level is always visible.
[02:00:55.528 --> 02:01:01.489]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.

[02:01:13.533 --> 02:01:20.755]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:25.436 --> 02:01:27.256]  Okay, let's talk to Kevin.
[02:01:28.537 --> 02:01:32.598]  Then we'll cover this news about the Philippines and government-sponsored terror.
[02:01:33.258 --> 02:01:37.379]  Then we'll shift gears and go to Willie and Joe and Darren and others.
[02:01:38.594 --> 02:01:39.976]  Kevin in Texas, go ahead.
[02:01:40.476 --> 02:01:40.997]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:41.477 --> 02:01:43.959]  Colonel Roberts, it's a great honor to speak to you.
[02:01:44.099 --> 02:01:45.301]  You guys got my head spinning.
[02:01:45.401 --> 02:01:50.605]  I originally called up to talk about the Dallas Police Force, but I'll get to that in a second.
[02:01:50.706 --> 02:01:52.407]  I'm sitting here.
[02:01:52.427 --> 02:01:58.553]  I guess if your previous caller was going to be the guy turning the ovens on in Guantanamo Bay, I guess my brother is going to be the train driver.
[02:01:59.293 --> 02:02:01.676]  I'm looking at an MPEG file on CD.
[02:02:03.052 --> 02:02:03.533]  I think so.
[02:02:14.221 --> 02:02:17.063]  Wow, they're going to need to round up a lot of folks in October.
[02:02:17.103 --> 02:02:22.086]  And they're out there pouring concrete for a mass camp, according to the Miami Herald.
[02:02:22.106 --> 02:02:24.008]  Hey, I wonder what's coming up in September, Colonel.
[02:02:38.667 --> 02:02:40.348]  Well, I've got a question first.
[02:02:41.308 --> 02:02:50.372]  If this is going to be a civil airline transport contract to haul prisoners in, is there any information in this MPEG file that you've got showing where they're flying from?
[02:02:50.392 --> 02:02:53.133]  No, not anything there.
[02:02:53.173 --> 02:02:57.075]  It's just the procedures on how to arrive and depart out of Guantanamo Bay.
[02:02:57.795 --> 02:02:58.755]  No, I know, Kevin.
[02:02:58.795 --> 02:03:00.096]  He's done some work with me, so...
[02:03:01.606 --> 02:03:03.927]  He lives here in Dallas, in Austin, in Dallas.
[02:03:04.368 --> 02:03:06.689]  And I know your brother, he's the pilot.
[02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:08.070]  I don't want to get into too much detail.
[02:03:08.150 --> 02:03:10.572]  I'm not going to say what airline he flies for or anything.
[02:03:10.632 --> 02:03:12.653]  But, I mean, so it's a big business.
[02:03:13.434 --> 02:03:18.898]  The Lister's calling in to get the camp jobs at the ovens, and then your brother's going to be flying people in?
[02:03:18.938 --> 02:03:22.340]  I mean, he's basically, being an airline pilot, you're basically a federal employee.
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:24.942]  I mean, you know, you can't rock the boat too much, but...
[02:03:25.482 --> 02:03:30.686]  I wanted to say, I read the Somalia book that Robert has in the One Shot One Kill.
[02:03:30.986 --> 02:03:41.233]  He is an excellent writer and he's somebody that has credibility from the military that can bridge this gap where someone would be called a conspiracy nut or whatever and not have any credibility.
[02:03:41.673 --> 02:03:42.213]  He has it.
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:49.924]  One thing I noticed that, you know, until about a week ago, they kept saying, well, the death toll since hostilities ended in Iraq is at 50.
[02:03:50.384 --> 02:03:51.565]  And I'm like, how can it be at 50?
[02:03:52.225 --> 02:03:56.688]  We've had 10 killed this week, and today I saw they came out and said it's 138.
[02:03:56.968 --> 02:04:00.350]  So it's jumped from about 50 to 138 in a weekend.
[02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:09.115]  Also, all the government websites said all combat activities have ended, and then now they've changed them all, and news articles have all changed to major deaths.
[02:04:11.098 --> 02:04:12.259]  Colonel, we've confirmed this.
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:16.806]  They're actually going back, not just in government sites now, but newspapers and changing that.
[02:04:17.106 --> 02:04:20.892]  What does it mean when retroactively newspapers start getting edited?
[02:04:21.613 --> 02:04:29.296]  Well, that's common practice, though, if you look at Operation Mockingbird, where the CIA controls the media anyway.
[02:04:29.336 --> 02:04:36.038]  They have to be able to go along with the government program because you have to control the minds of the people, and you do that by rewriting history.
[02:04:36.058 --> 02:04:38.839]  Well, that's right out of the Ministry of Truth in Winston.
[02:04:40.339 --> 02:04:44.281]  Colonel Roberts, I don't know if you know about this, but in March I filmed a...
[02:04:45.126 --> 02:04:45.826]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:05:04.814 --> 02:05:14.198]  You know, I had Anne-Marie Slaughter from Princeton saying, you know, we can't tell the American public that Iraq's the base of operations and then go to Iran and then Syria and then Saudi Arabia.
[02:05:14.238 --> 02:05:15.178]  They'd never stand for it.
[02:05:15.278 --> 02:05:23.882]  Kevin shot that footage there at the meeting, and it is just chilling, chilling stuff.
[02:05:23.922 --> 02:05:25.442]  And he talked about World War IV.
[02:05:25.863 --> 02:05:28.183]  Then a month later it was on CNN, big headline.
[02:05:28.223 --> 02:05:29.524]  Woolsey says we're in World War IV.
[02:05:29.564 --> 02:05:31.925]  But, yeah, they sit around and brag with news cameras.
[02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:36.003]  That we've got to lie to the people and can't let them know what we're doing?
[02:05:36.464 --> 02:05:38.066]  Ron Paul's speech talks about that.
[02:05:38.086 --> 02:05:40.209]  How the neocons brag, how they manipulate us.
[02:05:40.469 --> 02:05:41.250]  Incredible speech.
[02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:42.972]  That's going to be a historic document.
[02:05:43.152 --> 02:05:52.123]  Why are they so arrogant, Colonel, that they can just publicly brag in front of ten news cameras that, yeah, we're going to lie to the people and this will never be on the news as they look at the news cameras?
[02:05:52.623 --> 02:06:07.314]  Well, you know, I think that they think they have a handle on the whole situation that's not going to be changed now, and a lot of them are getting a little bit reckless, which is good because it shows stupidity on their part because not all of us are dumbed down to the point where we don't see this stuff anymore.
[02:06:07.334 --> 02:06:09.015]  Why do criminals always get reckless?
[02:06:10.874 --> 02:06:15.716]  I think it's human nature that you get cocky and you get overconfident.
[02:06:15.996 --> 02:06:23.858]  You know, you see it in sports where one team goes out, they've won five games in a row, and they know that this team's not going to be a challenge, and they get beat because they get overconfident.
[02:06:24.558 --> 02:06:28.880]  But these people, they start announcing things ahead, and a lot of times they'll do that just to see what kind of play they get.
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:30.060]  They can always deny it later.
[02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:32.681]  They say, that's not what I meant, or it was taken out of context.
[02:06:33.141 --> 02:06:34.702]  Well, they don't even say that.
[02:06:34.762 --> 02:06:37.244]  They say, I never said there was a Patriot Act, dude.
[02:06:37.464 --> 02:06:39.085]  And then, oh yes, we need to pass it.
[02:06:39.265 --> 02:06:40.646]  And then I never said I did that.
[02:06:40.686 --> 02:06:42.367]  I mean, I've got it on tape going.
[02:06:42.387 --> 02:06:43.668]  There is no second Patriot Act.
[02:06:43.788 --> 02:06:44.988]  It does not affect citizens later.
[02:06:45.128 --> 02:06:46.229]  But there is a second Patriot Act.
[02:06:46.269 --> 02:06:47.030]  You better pass it.
[02:06:47.050 --> 02:06:47.970]  It does affect citizens.
[02:06:48.110 --> 02:06:55.555]  Colonel Roberts, Ann Marie Slaughter did a two-hour presentation two nights before this particular meeting, and I've got the handout from it.
[02:06:55.575 --> 02:06:57.976]  The name of her lecture was A New World Order.
[02:06:58.076 --> 02:06:59.037]  Yeah, I showed it on TV.
[02:06:59.077 --> 02:07:02.359]  And they're all just clapping and laughing and patting each other on the back, but
[02:07:03.601 --> 02:07:09.231]  We've just got to get to a point where we can tell people these things and they don't forget when they go to sleep and they go,
[02:07:09.795 --> 02:07:11.595]  You know, oh wow, you know, that was weird.
[02:07:11.615 --> 02:07:12.476]  I did hear about that.
[02:07:12.536 --> 02:07:14.516]  But people don't connect the dots.
[02:07:14.536 --> 02:07:19.697]  But last thing I wanted to say, you're a police officer, a retired police officer.
[02:07:20.077 --> 02:07:24.258]  The Dallas police force and all of Dallas politics is so racially driven.
[02:07:24.498 --> 02:07:25.198]  It's a joke.
[02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:27.579]  It's a media circus always.
[02:07:27.659 --> 02:07:29.179]  It's a way to control everybody.
[02:07:29.299 --> 02:07:32.900]  They put in this police chief, bumped him up over everyone's head.
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:34.180]  I think he was a patrol officer.
[02:07:34.804 --> 02:07:41.248]  A black man, there was a complete purge of the upper echelon of the Dallas Police Force, which I mean, you know, maybe it's not such a bad thing.
[02:07:41.688 --> 02:07:44.089]  They're probably one of the most corrupt departments in the world.
[02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:47.391]  The fallout was predictable.
[02:07:47.831 --> 02:07:49.192]  He wasn't able to handle the job.
[02:07:49.232 --> 02:07:51.393]  There was great divisions between the power structure.
[02:07:52.134 --> 02:07:53.915]  It's been nothing but a failure for him.
[02:07:53.955 --> 02:07:55.035]  There's so many shootings here.
[02:07:55.356 --> 02:07:57.417]  Today, an hour ago, he was fired.
[02:07:57.957 --> 02:08:00.018]  So now it's a racial divide.
[02:08:00.378 --> 02:08:03.040]  Last week, Giuliani and associates were in town.
[02:08:03.652 --> 02:08:09.954]  Pitching to the city council how they can come in and run the Dallas Police Department like they did in New York and clean it up.
[02:08:10.574 --> 02:08:14.095]  Oh, yeah, Giuliani's a definite CIA guy.
[02:08:14.135 --> 02:08:19.537]  He's going around selling them on the anti-terror, no civil liberties, no freedoms model.
[02:08:19.837 --> 02:08:23.038]  Colonel, comments on how they're covertly federalizing cities.
[02:08:23.338 --> 02:08:25.939]  And the FBI is taking charge of the department also.
[02:08:25.959 --> 02:08:26.519]  And I'll stop.
[02:08:26.679 --> 02:08:27.499]  Thank you very much, guys.
[02:08:27.639 --> 02:08:28.940]  Yeah, let me just say this.
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:30.301]  Thanks, Kevin.
[02:08:30.321 --> 02:08:32.223]  It's in my analysis of Patriot Act 2.
[02:08:32.423 --> 02:08:34.966]  Yes, I'm writing an analysis of the Victory Act.
[02:08:36.027 --> 02:08:37.228]  And let me just say this in a nutshell.
[02:08:37.248 --> 02:08:41.373]  The Victory Act has some new stuff, but mainly it's Patriot Act 1 and Patriot Act 2.
[02:08:41.914 --> 02:08:45.818]  Some of the key provisions mixed together because they're afraid stuff's getting repealed.
[02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:48.941]  They want to repass it again under new names.
[02:08:49.001 --> 02:08:50.443]  But just for folks to understand here,
[02:08:51.573 --> 02:08:56.257]  They have another bill that takes over local governments.
[02:08:56.838 --> 02:08:59.660]  And this new bill, and I have the bill number in the document.
[02:08:59.701 --> 02:09:00.501]  I can't remember it right now.
[02:09:01.102 --> 02:09:01.883]  It's in my analysis.
[02:09:01.943 --> 02:09:03.624]  I just mention it and have a subsection.
[02:09:04.265 --> 02:09:10.090]  Detroit, L.A., New York, Times-Picayune reported on New Orleans.
[02:09:10.110 --> 02:09:12.032]  So they just calmly announced the feds were in the city.
[02:09:12.572 --> 02:09:15.095]  So they get a city in trouble, and the feds come in and take over.
[02:09:15.115 --> 02:09:16.436]  Colonel Robertson, how important is that?
[02:09:17.438 --> 02:09:20.302]  Well, it's extremely important because there's two things that's happening.
[02:09:21.503 --> 02:09:25.208]  Your caller just mentioned one that brought one to mind.
[02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:27.691]  People don't understand.
[02:09:27.711 --> 02:09:28.652]  They don't know that this is happening.
[02:09:29.714 --> 02:09:33.619]  There is a national organization of chiefs of police.
[02:09:34.179 --> 02:09:34.779]  We're good to go.
[02:09:57.735 --> 02:10:02.041]  We had a guy that was in my academy class.
[02:10:02.101 --> 02:10:07.547]  He's a good guy and I like him, but he was very socialist, very globalist, and he became the chief of police.
[02:10:07.567 --> 02:10:16.578]  The next thing we knew, the whole department was ending up with all kinds of decisions that were shoving us into the KGB mentality.
[02:10:17.348 --> 02:10:19.750]  And this is happening in different cities around the country.
[02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:36.299]  Now, when they can't do that, or when something else goes astray, what they do is they say, gee, it's such a disaster, we're going to have to fire this guy, we've got to have help, and we're going to have to go outside the department to get help, and we're going to have to go here, and we're going to have to go there, and they end up bringing in federal authorities to take over in the interim.
[02:10:36.939 --> 02:10:38.059]  Texas isn't the first place.
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:40.781]  I mean, this has happened in other states as well, especially up north.
[02:10:41.161 --> 02:10:42.442]  Now, what happens at that point...
[02:10:43.608 --> 02:10:50.312]  As you get the FBI that comes in, let's say, and they put their idea of the way this department ought to be running.
[02:10:50.332 --> 02:10:52.434]  What they do is they come in with new policies and procedures.
[02:10:52.474 --> 02:10:58.617]  They come in with new... And they say 50 of your officers are now going to be watching the evil right-wingers.
[02:10:58.797 --> 02:10:59.278]  Oh, yeah.
[02:10:59.298 --> 02:11:04.561]  They can create sub-task force in different units and reorganize the whole department into whatever image they want.
[02:11:04.581 --> 02:11:07.162]  And at that point, it becomes nothing but a clone of the federal government.
[02:11:08.283 --> 02:11:09.504]  And here's another thing that's happening.
[02:11:09.524 --> 02:11:12.986]  We're seeing what's known as cross-deputization and cross-commissioning.
[02:11:13.366 --> 02:11:24.831]  That means I'm out here on the streets and they call me in a squad meeting and say, this is Agent So-and-So from the federal government and we're going to now make you a federal officer as well as a city and state officer.
[02:11:25.151 --> 02:11:33.715]  You are now going to have two commissions so that you can be task-forced to help on joint task forces to deal with drugs or deal with whatever.
[02:11:33.735 --> 02:11:35.756]  And there's no reason to do that.
[02:11:36.016 --> 02:11:36.416]  No, there's no.
[02:11:36.617 --> 02:11:44.302]  Because once you've done that, once you cross-deputize everybody across the country, you have created a national police force that, above all, is answerable to the Department of Justice.
[02:11:44.322 --> 02:11:47.284]  And that's what FEMA has on their badges, is national police force.
[02:11:47.384 --> 02:11:47.805]  That's right.
[02:11:47.865 --> 02:11:57.552]  And once you get to answering to the Department of Justice, you answer to whoever the head of the Department of Justice is, which means you answer also to the President of the United States.
[02:11:58.633 --> 02:11:59.894]  Because he works for the president.
[02:11:59.934 --> 02:12:06.940]  So in your chain of command, it jumps from out of your local jurisdiction under your second badge.
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:10.363]  All it does is make the police chief the city governor.
[02:12:10.583 --> 02:12:11.924]  Yeah, he's redundant at that point.
[02:12:13.085 --> 02:12:17.849]  He's the guy held accountable for stuff, and he's the buffer zone, but he's not the power behind the throne now.
[02:12:18.170 --> 02:12:20.231]  The power behind the throne is the guy you answer to and watch.
[02:12:20.291 --> 02:12:21.933]  Basically, you've got a ready-made patsy.
[02:12:22.654 --> 02:12:30.006]  And the feds come in and teach you how to not just shoot some innocent kid in the back, but here, we'll burn down a church and kill everybody inside and make it look good.
[02:12:30.286 --> 02:12:32.049]  We'll teach you how to be real professionals.
[02:12:32.770 --> 02:12:36.557]  Well, you know, the thing that goes beyond that
[02:12:37.231 --> 02:12:43.135]  is what happens when all of a sudden they say we have a national emergency, you are now operating all as federal agents.
[02:12:43.195 --> 02:12:57.885]  Oh, by the way, and I'm talking to the police officers who are listening to this, by the way, all you local officers, you need to go in and get all of your new safety equipment that we're issuing and get your guns checked and make sure that you have your guns and your ammunition all checked and make sure everything's up to date.
[02:12:57.905 --> 02:12:58.606]  We're paying for it.
[02:12:58.646 --> 02:12:59.366]  Don't worry about it.
[02:12:59.426 --> 02:13:00.067]  It's a good penny.
[02:13:00.367 --> 02:13:03.509]  You go in there, they take your gun away from you, and now you are an unarmed police officer.
[02:13:03.649 --> 02:13:05.933]  And by the way, we've got an inoculation for you.
[02:13:05.973 --> 02:13:10.141]  They're talking about a national draft for doctors and police to force you to take the shots.
[02:13:10.241 --> 02:13:11.584]  Willie, you're up next.
[02:13:14.844 --> 02:13:15.385]  We're good to go.

[02:15:15.787 --> 02:15:21.531]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:15:21.791 --> 02:15:26.915]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:15:27.255 --> 02:15:36.541]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[02:15:42.164 --> 02:15:46.186]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.

[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:17.501]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[02:16:17.762 --> 02:16:19.182]  If so, hope has arrived.
[02:16:19.662 --> 02:16:21.083]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[02:16:21.363 --> 02:16:26.525]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.

[02:16:31.687 --> 02:16:40.371]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[02:16:40.851 --> 02:16:41.271]  Gum disease
[02:16:42.452 --> 02:16:46.194]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[02:16:46.474 --> 02:16:53.119]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.

[02:17:21.799 --> 02:17:27.703]  Let's go to him quickly.
[02:17:27.763 --> 02:17:31.585]  Willie in Alabama, I guess with an update on the Judge Roy Moore situation.
[02:17:31.605 --> 02:17:32.046]  Go ahead.
[02:17:32.566 --> 02:17:34.027]  Greetings, Mr. Jones, Mr. Roberts.
[02:17:34.367 --> 02:17:46.395]  Yes, sir, I was up there for about three nights and four or five days, and I just came back to Mobile to get a break and pass the baton to some other Christians, and I wanted to bring you on a little update on what's going on, if I may.
[02:17:47.475 --> 02:17:47.596]  The...
[02:17:50.257 --> 02:17:50.757]  The U.S.
[02:17:50.777 --> 02:17:55.099]  Supreme Court, let me see if I can get everything in order here.
[02:17:55.839 --> 02:18:05.483]  Chief Justice Roy Moore found out he was suspended by the eight other state Supreme Court justices on CNN News, and he was never served.
[02:18:05.523 --> 02:18:09.464]  And the other eight weren't even letting him in his office to get his personal items.
[02:18:12.402 --> 02:18:18.763]  A counter-lawsuit has been filed by Kelly McGinley and some others, and I believe you know her.
[02:18:18.824 --> 02:18:22.605]  She has www.retakingamerica.com in Mobile.
[02:18:22.625 --> 02:18:26.166]  I believe you've been interviewed on her program before in Mobile.
[02:18:29.847 --> 02:18:32.348]  There's so much going on up there.
[02:18:34.409 --> 02:18:40.397]  Anyway, we've had great speakers, Dr. Rick Scarborough, Vision America, Howard Phillips, Conservative Caucus.
[02:18:40.918 --> 02:18:43.862]  We've had Ambassador Alan Keyes, who's just been a jewel.
[02:18:43.922 --> 02:18:47.867]  I mean, he's just given so many great patriot speeches up there.
[02:18:47.887 --> 02:18:51.672]  Of course, Jerry Falwell came up and was embracing George W. Bush.
[02:18:52.233 --> 02:18:54.395]  So far, I have not seen him yet.
[02:18:54.735 --> 02:18:55.976]  He's not showed up yet.
[02:18:56.176 --> 02:18:59.758]  Thank you, Bush, for appointing all these judges, and this woman's going after more.
[02:19:00.139 --> 02:19:05.762]  Thank you for Bohemian Grove, and thank you for Open Borders and Gun Control, and thank you for being a neocon.
[02:19:06.403 --> 02:19:08.965]  Let me get comments from Colonel Roberts about this.
[02:19:09.625 --> 02:19:15.249]  Well, you know, it goes back to what we were talking about in the beginning, that they have established a system where they put people on the bench.
[02:19:15.509 --> 02:19:15.789]  Right.
[02:19:15.809 --> 02:19:17.830]  When you control the judicial branch and you control the...
[02:19:36.179 --> 02:19:37.140]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:06.187]  And so you've got Judge Moore there that's got this, you know, the Ten Commandments sitting there, but where does it go from there?
[02:20:06.207 --> 02:20:14.695]  And this is what no one wants to do is they don't want to think ahead of the jet because where it goes from there is when do we take the Bibles out of all the public libraries that are run by the government?
[02:20:15.035 --> 02:20:17.678]  When do we take oaths out of our oaths of office?
[02:20:17.778 --> 02:20:18.999]  You know, I mean, how far does this thing go?
[02:20:19.019 --> 02:20:21.802]  Well, Colonel Roberts, I've got a, and thank you, Willie, for the call.
[02:20:22.203 --> 02:20:26.247]  I've got a stack here of news articles where that's already begun.
[02:20:26.267 --> 02:20:27.208]  We'll get to those.
[02:20:28.028 --> 02:20:31.332]  Let's talk to Joe in Oklahoma.
[02:20:31.392 --> 02:20:32.293]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:20:32.313 --> 02:20:33.174]  Hi, Alex.
[02:20:33.694 --> 02:20:33.975]  Hello.
[02:20:33.995 --> 02:20:35.396]  How are you doing today?
[02:20:35.616 --> 02:20:36.077]  Moving okay.
[02:20:36.593 --> 02:20:36.913]  Good deal.
[02:20:37.373 --> 02:20:45.097]  I just wanted to bring up something that Colonel Roberts mentioned about the big virus that was going through.
[02:20:45.117 --> 02:20:55.301]  It's kind of a red herring there because it's a really simple virus that probably any first-year university student could have encoded.
[02:20:55.321 --> 02:20:57.281]  I've been working in IT for about eight years.
[02:20:58.642 --> 02:21:04.164]  It's pretty interesting because if people wanted to get real malicious, you wouldn't even be reading about it.
[02:21:04.184 --> 02:21:05.545]  It would be so stealthy that...
[02:21:06.365 --> 02:21:08.827]  They would take over your computer and you wouldn't know about it.
[02:21:08.847 --> 02:21:13.230]  Well, that's the kind of stuff the government's got, and I think Roberts is talking about the scale of it.
[02:21:13.651 --> 02:21:15.492]  But go ahead and be specific exactly.
[02:21:15.932 --> 02:21:16.593]  What are you saying?
[02:21:16.613 --> 02:21:30.383]  It's kind of, you know, people shouldn't look at this as, you know, a malicious attack by a government or by a terrorist organization.
[02:21:30.993 --> 02:21:35.336]  But really more like a kid sitting in his room.
[02:21:35.756 --> 02:21:41.420]  All I was saying is I've read the Chinese newspapers, not somebody saying the Chinese said it.
[02:21:41.540 --> 02:21:52.727]  I've read the Chinese newspapers where they, and supposedly our friends, folks, where they say we're the big enemy and they order their college students to launch hack attacks on America.
[02:21:53.368 --> 02:21:53.608]  So...
[02:21:54.790 --> 02:22:00.177]  I think what Craig was saying is that's one of the big culprits of a lot of the mischief we see.
[02:22:00.497 --> 02:22:01.318]  Any comments, Craig?
[02:22:01.559 --> 02:22:09.990]  Yeah, and I'm not going to... I can't agree that some kid in high school can do this because I've been in computers for 20 years and I can't do it, so...
[02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:12.091]  Yeah, I've been in eight.
[02:22:12.371 --> 02:22:13.372]  Well, that may be.
[02:22:13.392 --> 02:22:15.292]  You've had a lot of classes on programming stuff.
[02:22:15.312 --> 02:22:22.636]  But what I'm saying is it cost us over $10 billion a day and lost business through the Internet because of this virus.
[02:22:22.736 --> 02:22:24.877]  And the government isn't doing anything about it.
[02:22:24.897 --> 02:22:26.278]  They're not trying to track down who did it.
[02:22:26.418 --> 02:22:28.199]  Yeah, they designed the system.
[02:22:28.239 --> 02:22:32.001]  Look, they gave the communist Chinese last year the Microsoft system.
[02:22:32.401 --> 02:22:32.941]  The code.
[02:22:33.222 --> 02:22:37.684]  Well, why aren't they on the news every night telling us how to defeat this thing?
[02:22:37.704 --> 02:22:39.585]  Because I'm going to tell you right now how to defeat it.
[02:22:39.645 --> 02:22:40.866]  It's real easy.
[02:22:41.006 --> 02:22:41.266]  It is.
[02:22:41.746 --> 02:22:42.967]  Okay, well, I'll tell you what.
[02:22:43.047 --> 02:22:44.268]  Stay there, Joe, and stay there, Craig.
[02:22:44.308 --> 02:22:49.151]  We'll get both your takes on how to fix it, and then we'll talk to Darren, Mike, and Pat.
[02:22:50.071 --> 02:22:56.575]  And that's it for calls, because I've got to get to the Philippines news, government-sponsored terror, a bunch of this stuff, and I want to dig out these articles.
[02:22:56.615 --> 02:22:59.697]  We're all over the country, from Texas to Missouri to California.
[02:22:59.717 --> 02:23:01.338]  They're going after Bibles anywhere now.
[02:23:05.151 --> 02:23:06.034]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.535 --> 02:23:08.139]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.082 --> 02:23:11.769]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:17.172]  Are you willing to speculate in today's market?
[02:23:17.493 --> 02:23:21.156]  Options investing involves substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.
[02:23:21.517 --> 02:23:23.699]  I'm Patrick T. Parker for Barclay Financial.
[02:23:23.859 --> 02:23:29.224]  Right now, we're recommending the pertinent... Get the advanced Berkey Lite for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:23:29.264 --> 02:23:30.105]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:23:51.083 --> 02:23:53.225]  Welcome back, my friends.
[02:23:53.245 --> 02:23:56.648]  Already into the next to final segment.
[02:23:56.668 --> 02:23:58.770]  We've got about 26 minutes left here.
[02:23:58.790 --> 02:24:03.435]  And go ahead, caller.
[02:24:03.495 --> 02:24:10.001]  You were raising the point of this virus not originating from some government.
[02:24:11.062 --> 02:24:11.322]  Yeah.
[02:24:11.762 --> 02:24:14.325]  And just to me, it kind of takes people's
[02:24:16.345 --> 02:24:21.689]  Speak up a little bit.
[02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.770]  Sorry.
[02:24:23.011 --> 02:24:30.857]  It just takes people's attention away from real issues that we have, like in Guantanamo Bay and et cetera.
[02:24:30.897 --> 02:24:35.720]  Kind of a red herring was only the point I was trying to make.
[02:24:35.881 --> 02:24:36.361]  Well, okay.
[02:24:36.401 --> 02:24:38.483]  How do you fix it?
[02:24:38.583 --> 02:24:43.927]  The easiest way to fix it, I would go to Symantec.com, and they have a removal tool.
[02:24:44.793 --> 02:24:51.474]  Go ahead and change the registry settings and kill the virus and wipe it off your hard drive.
[02:24:52.195 --> 02:24:53.415]  Well, that's if it's on your hard drive.
[02:24:53.455 --> 02:25:00.456]  The problem is it's not on my hard drive because I clean it every day, and I get over 200 emails a day with this junk on it to open the attachment.
[02:25:00.816 --> 02:25:02.337]  And this has been on for two weeks.
[02:25:02.437 --> 02:25:10.599]  Now, this is coming from, and it also takes my email address and sends it all over the Internet, making me look like I'm sending it and I have a virus when I don't.
[02:25:10.659 --> 02:25:12.459]  Now, here's how you stop that.
[02:25:13.874 --> 02:25:20.127]  I can only address the Outlook Express is what I use.
[02:25:21.644 --> 02:25:22.665]  Okay, go to Tools.
[02:25:23.205 --> 02:25:26.488]  Go to the Tools at the top in the Outlook Express when you've got your email program open.
[02:25:26.988 --> 02:25:31.552]  And then you go from the Tools tab, you go to Message Rules.
[02:25:32.292 --> 02:25:33.073]  Then you go to Mail.
[02:25:33.433 --> 02:25:35.855]  And you're not going to remember this, but just know it's there.
[02:25:36.356 --> 02:25:42.540]  Then Mail Rules is just following the progression down until you can click on the rule description and you can edit in there.
[02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:44.242]  You can type in a line that says...
[02:25:44.842 --> 02:25:55.847]  I don't want any more email that says, open the attachment, or I don't want any more email that says, RE your application, or RE thank you, or RE your details.
[02:25:55.888 --> 02:25:58.329]  You know, all of these things that it's using over and over again.
[02:25:58.349 --> 02:26:02.851]  And you can go to Semantic, and you can go to McAfee, and you can get a list of all of these subject headers.
[02:26:03.291 --> 02:26:07.053]  You can type them in there, and from now on, it will weed those out automatically and throw them in the trash.
[02:26:07.293 --> 02:26:13.196]  And it's also a good idea to do that because that's a common tactic that almost all email viruses use.
[02:26:13.656 --> 02:26:13.796]  Yeah.
[02:26:13.836 --> 02:26:17.237]  And they use a lot of similar subject lines.
[02:26:17.277 --> 02:26:17.897]  Right, right.
[02:26:18.258 --> 02:26:24.760]  And if you learn how to just go in there and set your message rules to delete, you can go subject, you can go who it's from.
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:29.923]  If you don't want any more from Uncle John, you can put his name in there and you're not going to get any more.
[02:26:29.943 --> 02:26:32.584]  I don't want any more mortgage ads or Viagra ads.
[02:26:32.644 --> 02:26:33.344]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:33.484 --> 02:26:34.445]  Yeah, same thing, Alex.
[02:26:34.505 --> 02:26:39.087]  I put those in there myself, including a few other I don't even want to mention on the air that keep coming in.
[02:26:39.827 --> 02:26:40.228]  Yeah.
[02:26:41.348 --> 02:26:46.391]  Okay, before we go to Darren and Mike and Pat, that'll be our final calls.
[02:26:46.411 --> 02:26:47.491]  Let's get to some news, Colonel.
[02:26:48.212 --> 02:26:48.872]  This is important.
[02:26:48.892 --> 02:26:49.853]  Let me just read this article.
[02:26:49.933 --> 02:26:50.673]  AFP.
[02:26:52.414 --> 02:26:54.495]  It's a big French newspaper, news service.
[02:26:54.515 --> 02:27:00.078]  Disgruntled rebel Philippine troops claimed a moral victory Monday despite being forced to return...
[02:27:01.235 --> 02:27:22.149]  Dejected to barracks after their failed military uprising in central Manila, the young, battle-tested and idealistic military officers and enlisted men reluctantly agreed to end their 22-hour siege and be court-martialed after the authorities agreed to consider demands for a probe into allegations of military and government corruption.
[02:27:22.887 --> 02:27:29.750]  We were ready to die, but give up for the sake of our comrades in the military and the interest of the people and the country.
[02:27:29.770 --> 02:27:37.053]  31-year-old Navy officer Antonio Trinalis, the self-styled leader of the group, said, We have already planted the seeds.
[02:27:37.093 --> 02:27:40.875]  We will just have to bite the bullet and roll with the punches.
[02:27:40.955 --> 02:27:43.136]  Hopefully, we have inspired others.
[02:27:43.196 --> 02:27:45.997]  This is our significant contribution to the country.
[02:27:46.037 --> 02:27:47.818]  Folks, they could get life in prison or executed.
[02:27:49.364 --> 02:28:02.733]  He said he and his 300-odd men ended their occupation of an upscale apartment and shopping complex in the financial center after intense negotiations with the government, opposition, and military officials.
[02:28:03.354 --> 02:28:16.643]  In the end, sources close to the negotiations said the key figures of the mutiny, whose average age was 27 years old, were largely influenced by colleagues from their alma mater, the Philippine Military Academy, where they belonged to a class renowned for its brilliance and idealism.
[02:28:17.393 --> 02:28:33.521]  Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff, General Narisco Abella, agreed he would create a special panel to study the complaints raised by the young officers against President Glorio Arroyo's administration in the military.
[02:28:35.062 --> 02:28:44.066]  That goes on to say, Trimnilis, who spoke to Arroyo about his grievances before the revolt, sounded dejected in a local television interview.
[02:28:46.414 --> 02:28:51.716]  And he says, these reforms will not come in my lifetime, he said in a defeat in his voice.
[02:28:52.276 --> 02:29:02.880]  Pinalas had documented the irregularities in the Philippines military in a controversial thesis he submitted for a master's degree at the University of Philippines last year.
[02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:14.965]  Eugene Gonzalez, another rebel leader, military officer in revolt, was a reminder of the country's leaders to serve with sincerity, adding that his group was prepared to face the music for its action.
[02:29:16.537 --> 02:29:17.338]  And it goes on.
[02:29:18.259 --> 02:29:19.020]  Now, here it is.
[02:29:19.181 --> 02:29:34.581]  They accuse the military leadership of selling arms to rebels from the country's biggest separatist Muslim group, the Islamic Liberation Front, or MILF, the Communist Guerrilla Force of New People's Army, and the notorious Abu Sayyaf Kingpin.
[02:29:35.484 --> 02:29:36.205]  We're good to go.
[02:29:51.403 --> 02:29:52.124]  We're good to go.
[02:30:07.814 --> 02:30:13.077]  ...in the southern Philippines in a bid to declare the MILF a terrorist group and eventually get more U.S.
[02:30:13.117 --> 02:30:15.338]  funding for the anti-terror campaign.
[02:30:15.358 --> 02:30:22.441]  They also accused the military leadership of planning bombings in Manila in a bid to extend Orario's stay in power through martial law.
[02:30:22.782 --> 02:30:37.209]  They will also do this through bombings in Metro Milan, which they will blame on other groups, said Gambalala, citing the recent escape of self-confessed Indonesian terrorist father
[02:30:38.141 --> 02:30:38.581]  I think?
[02:30:56.539 --> 02:30:57.841]  Well, and it is, and it's not the first time, and
[02:31:13.198 --> 02:31:27.562]  And it's probably going to continue on because it's kind of a modus operandi for anybody in the intelligence segment to be able to initiate an action so that they can have a counteraction to it, so they can justify spending more money or bringing in more troops.
[02:31:27.982 --> 02:31:33.223]  And this whole thing is pointing toward us putting American forces back into the Philippines.
[02:31:33.243 --> 02:31:34.784]  And we've been there several times before.
[02:31:34.864 --> 02:31:35.984]  In fact, we just pulled out.
[02:31:36.004 --> 02:31:42.306]  We just gave them Clark Air Base and the Naval Station back.
[02:31:43.007 --> 02:31:50.975]  And all of a sudden, here we've got this, that they're saying, we need American money, we need American troops, and we're starting to send special forces guys over there.
[02:31:51.775 --> 02:31:52.977]  Now, we've always had them over there.
[02:31:53.037 --> 02:32:02.305]  Colonel Nick Rau was over there, and Colonel Rau was, if you remember him, he was in Vietnam, I think as a lieutenant, was captured by the Viet Cong, was one of the few people that escaped and actually got away.
[02:32:02.345 --> 02:32:06.529]  He'd been there, I mean, they had him in cage for several months, and he actually escaped and got away.
[02:32:06.569 --> 02:32:07.090]  Wait a minute.
[02:32:07.739 --> 02:32:10.260]  What's wrong with being in a cage with mosquitoes and rats?
[02:32:10.741 --> 02:32:13.502]  We do that to the people at Camp X-Ray.
[02:32:13.522 --> 02:32:14.523]  Isn't that a loving thing?
[02:32:14.543 --> 02:32:15.823]  Oh, I didn't say anything wrong with it.
[02:32:15.844 --> 02:32:17.725]  I just said I would rather have a nicer house than that.
[02:32:18.465 --> 02:32:19.465]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:32:19.726 --> 02:32:21.046]  Me too.
[02:32:21.066 --> 02:32:26.649]  Nick Rau, though, was in the Philippines, Special Forces, good guy, and he gets ambushed one day.
[02:32:26.669 --> 02:32:29.291]  I think it was in Manila or near Manila.
[02:32:30.592 --> 02:32:42.642]  He's in a van and a gorilla's come up and I can't remember if they shot him or threw a bomb in the van or what it was, but anyway, he was assassinated over there because he was starting to make waves on this very connection that, hey, there's a problem here.
[02:32:42.683 --> 02:32:46.626]  We've got people inside the Philippine government who are supplying the rebels, who are supplying the
[02:32:48.107 --> 02:32:48.607]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:33:11.075 --> 02:33:12.175]  Yeah, they always
[02:33:37.546 --> 02:33:38.868]  Well, it's the same thing in England.
[02:33:39.469 --> 02:33:42.914]  MI5 runs the terror groups, Protestant and Catholic.
[02:33:43.194 --> 02:33:44.296]  They're blowing things up.
[02:33:44.356 --> 02:33:45.858]  It's not that they're infiltrated.
[02:33:46.099 --> 02:33:51.507]  They run it, and British intelligence goes around kneecapping people if they won't start riots.
[02:33:51.547 --> 02:33:52.809]  I mean, it's controlled by them.
[02:33:54.130 --> 02:33:55.651]  Well, let's go back to the 1700s.
[02:33:56.011 --> 02:33:56.752]  It's the same thing.
[02:33:56.912 --> 02:34:06.760]  If you can stir up the people against an organization or against a government, then you can either take over the organization or the government by using the people.
[02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:08.361]  So you do that in the Philippines.
[02:34:08.381 --> 02:34:09.222]  You blow up a few things.
[02:34:09.242 --> 02:34:10.223]  You blame it on somebody.
[02:34:10.263 --> 02:34:10.743]  Hitler did it.
[02:34:10.763 --> 02:34:11.364]  It worked for him.
[02:34:12.191 --> 02:34:13.511]  And I think that's what we're seeing.
[02:34:13.531 --> 02:34:22.594]  So now you've got Philippine military personnel who are saying, you know, we found out that we're supplying the enemy and we're blowing up our own stuff and we're not putting up with it anymore.
[02:34:22.614 --> 02:34:27.255]  It's about time we had a little discussion with this government at that point, and that's where the insurrection came from.
[02:34:29.395 --> 02:34:34.616]  And then they gave themselves up to be put in prison for the rest of their lives.
[02:34:35.417 --> 02:34:39.537]  And they'll probably be killed in prison by communists who are openly working for the government.
[02:34:39.758 --> 02:34:41.458]  I mean, I've had leftist anarchists
[02:34:42.068 --> 02:34:43.870]  Yeah, they... Sometimes they get a little brazen.
[02:34:43.890 --> 02:34:44.430]  Anti-war looks stupid!
[02:35:05.828 --> 02:35:06.269]  We're good to go.
[02:35:06.289 --> 02:35:06.509]  I think?
[02:35:22.926 --> 02:35:25.608]  To accomplish their little new world order scenario.
[02:35:25.648 --> 02:35:26.288]  Well, it's simple.
[02:35:26.328 --> 02:35:38.637]  There's going to be more and more bombings, more and more terror, and the government gets bigger and bigger with more controls over our lives, and now everything's going to be a terrorist action, and it's just the excuse for the government to run our lives.
[02:35:38.777 --> 02:35:40.038]  Well, there's the next step.
[02:35:40.098 --> 02:35:47.903]  And when you go to the Gulag Archipelago by Alexander Solzhenitsyn and you start looking at it, we're seeing a blueprint that was done there happening here now.
[02:35:48.363 --> 02:35:55.047]  The next step is going to be terrorizing the population so badly that we're afraid to leave our houses.
[02:35:55.367 --> 02:35:56.808]  We're afraid to say anything.
[02:35:57.088 --> 02:35:59.110]  We're afraid to have radio shows like this.
[02:35:59.450 --> 02:36:02.793]  We're afraid to do anything because we don't want to be labeled a terrorist.
[02:36:02.813 --> 02:36:04.515]  We don't want to be labeled a criminal.
[02:36:04.535 --> 02:36:07.297]  We don't want anybody picking us up in the middle of the night.
[02:36:07.337 --> 02:36:08.798]  And that's where this is going right now.
[02:36:09.219 --> 02:36:12.782]  To protect you from yourself, we have to destroy you, basically.
[02:36:13.082 --> 02:36:14.644]  You know, it's the old Vietnam deal.
[02:36:14.984 --> 02:36:16.725]  To save the village, we had to destroy it.
[02:36:17.486 --> 02:36:21.910]  And their deal is to order out of chaos, and it's also to control by terror.
[02:36:22.110 --> 02:36:23.251]  Craig, we're not Russia.
[02:36:23.271 --> 02:36:24.092]  We're not China.
[02:36:25.037 --> 02:36:25.997]  We're not Cuba.
[02:36:26.477 --> 02:36:28.758]  And the key is we're being more vocal.
[02:36:29.318 --> 02:36:30.478]  We're being more active.
[02:36:30.599 --> 02:36:31.639]  More people are waking up.
[02:36:31.659 --> 02:36:35.540]  You talk about how you go to the deer camp, and 10 years ago, two cops out of 30 knew.
[02:36:35.580 --> 02:36:36.700]  Now almost all of you know.
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:45.643]  Don't you see it that we have a good chance if folks are active of standing up and not being cowed into submission and defeating this?
[02:36:45.883 --> 02:36:47.263]  I think it's happening more and more every day.
[02:36:47.683 --> 02:36:50.704]  But it only happens because we keep gas in our tanks.
[02:36:51.564 --> 02:37:03.768]  You know, the day we quit talking, the day we quit having these radio shows and publishing these books and doing these videos, and the day we quit doing the seminars and traveling and just decide, I'm just going to pass the torch on to somebody else.
[02:37:03.788 --> 02:37:05.109]  I'm going to kick back in my lawn chair.
[02:37:05.149 --> 02:37:08.750]  Yeah, folks, they spend a lot of time figuring out how to counter real patriots.
[02:37:09.130 --> 02:37:10.330]  We're on the threat board.
[02:37:10.631 --> 02:37:14.632]  You can see their propaganda in the news, the newspapers, the sitcoms, the dramas.
[02:37:15.353 --> 02:37:22.976]  You know, the episodes where it's all anti-gun messages, they're trying to counter us, and they know they're losing credibility.
[02:37:23.176 --> 02:37:28.298]  The polls have come out, Colonel, the mainstream news is losing almost all its credibility.
[02:37:28.698 --> 02:37:32.039]  Well, it was going to happen sooner or later, because people aren't totally stupid.
[02:37:32.079 --> 02:37:37.801]  People do have the ability to become educated, and once they do, you can't uneducate them.
[02:37:38.201 --> 02:37:39.682]  And that's the problem we're running into.
[02:37:39.722 --> 02:37:41.382]  They've tried to control the youth.
[02:37:41.422 --> 02:37:43.243]  They've tried to control the educational system.
[02:37:43.263 --> 02:37:46.144]  They've tried to control the religious systems in this country.
[02:37:46.464 --> 02:37:48.105]  They've tried to control the media.
[02:37:48.125 --> 02:37:51.126]  But the problem is the Americans are a different breed of cat.
[02:37:51.766 --> 02:37:55.828]  We don't fall in the same groove as the other people who line up in a row and turn in their guns.
[02:37:56.088 --> 02:37:57.268]  That's why we're more violent.
[02:37:57.308 --> 02:37:58.168]  That's why we have more.
[02:37:58.188 --> 02:38:04.751]  I mean, there's problems on that, but there's also pluses to being a bunch of wild folks from all over the place.
[02:38:05.231 --> 02:38:05.391]  Right.
[02:38:05.932 --> 02:38:09.334]  You're not ever going to be able to kill all the fish in the sea.
[02:38:09.394 --> 02:38:10.394]  It just isn't going to happen.
[02:38:11.995 --> 02:38:13.256]  But now it's a battle.
[02:38:13.316 --> 02:38:13.897]  It's a war.
[02:38:14.017 --> 02:38:15.738]  It's an information war right now.
[02:38:15.758 --> 02:38:16.778]  It's an education war.
[02:38:16.819 --> 02:38:19.180]  It's where we have to get other people on board.
[02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:24.183]  We have to make them see the truth, see the light, see what's going on, and then stand up against it.
[02:38:24.343 --> 02:38:26.064]  Do it at the ballot box.
[02:38:26.104 --> 02:38:27.745]  Do it on the soapbox.
[02:38:27.785 --> 02:38:28.286]  I don't care.
[02:38:28.846 --> 02:38:33.290]  But, you know, people at my church ask me, well, you know, we really need some leadership.
[02:38:33.330 --> 02:38:34.971]  We really need somebody to do something.
[02:38:34.991 --> 02:38:36.573]  And I said, let me tell you something.
[02:38:36.893 --> 02:38:37.373]  No, you don't.
[02:38:37.393 --> 02:38:38.994]  You need yourself to do something.
[02:38:39.035 --> 02:38:40.336]  Because I do radio shows.
[02:38:40.476 --> 02:38:41.156]  I write books.
[02:38:41.276 --> 02:38:43.278]  I put my head on a chopping block all the time.
[02:38:43.618 --> 02:38:52.826]  Yeah, Carl, in Vietnam when you were out there as a sniper, I mean, it's not, you know, the general's going to save me back in the command bunker.
[02:38:53.499 --> 02:38:53.959]  No, no.
[02:38:53.999 --> 02:38:55.720]  What we need is we need the troops on the line.
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:57.520]  We need the people in the Sunday school classes.
[02:38:57.540 --> 02:38:58.841]  We need the people at the bus stop.
[02:38:58.861 --> 02:39:02.042]  We need the people on the street to educate the guy standing next to them.
[02:39:02.642 --> 02:39:10.644]  And say, look... Well, look, ten years ago I was in college hearing how evil America was, and I got sick of hearing they're anti-gun, anti-family garbage, and I got on this path.
[02:39:11.004 --> 02:39:13.965]  You, you know, 15, 20 years ago began investigating it.
[02:39:14.285 --> 02:39:15.306]  You found out about it.
[02:39:15.606 --> 02:39:16.746]  I mean, it's simple, folks.
[02:39:16.806 --> 02:39:18.067]  You've all got to be leaders.
[02:39:18.367 --> 02:39:22.228]  There are people more articulate, more intelligent, with more resources than us...
[02:39:22.828 --> 02:39:26.730]  And I'm telling you, if you don't get involved, folks, we're going to lose it all.
[02:39:27.490 --> 02:39:34.914]  The globalists are the sickest, most ruthless synthesis of wickedness I have ever even tried to study or imagine.
[02:39:35.454 --> 02:39:36.935]  And it's their nature.
[02:39:36.975 --> 02:39:40.937]  And you better stop being naive, and you better admit that there is a devil.
[02:39:41.257 --> 02:39:45.079]  Because that's the devil's biggest trick, is convincing the world he didn't exist.
[02:39:45.359 --> 02:39:48.020]  That's how Ted Bundy got women in that Volkswagen.
[02:39:48.650 --> 02:39:49.030]  Okay.
[02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:51.211]  There's two kinds of people in the world, folks.
[02:39:51.791 --> 02:39:53.111]  And that's meat eaters and grass eaters.
[02:39:53.151 --> 02:39:56.472]  And you've got to figure out which one you are because the meat eaters eat the grass eaters.
[02:39:57.052 --> 02:39:59.513]  And there's two types of birds, eagles and ostriches.
[02:40:00.013 --> 02:40:04.094]  And if you're not an eagle, you've got your head in the sand and somebody's going to come along and quit sticking up.
[02:40:04.334 --> 02:40:05.575]  Well, I do a variant of that.
[02:40:05.595 --> 02:40:07.535]  You've got wolves, sheep, and sheepdogs.
[02:40:08.015 --> 02:40:08.616]  I'm not a wolf.
[02:40:08.656 --> 02:40:09.296]  I'm not a sheep.
[02:40:10.016 --> 02:40:12.537]  And I have this instinctive need to warn these people.
[02:40:14.337 --> 02:40:16.558]  Let's talk to Darren in Colorado.
[02:40:16.578 --> 02:40:17.218]  Go ahead, Darren.
[02:40:18.024 --> 02:40:18.745]  Good day, gentlemen.
[02:40:18.785 --> 02:40:22.308]  It's a distinct and profound pleasure to be with you today.
[02:40:22.348 --> 02:40:23.429]  Well, it's an honor to talk to you.
[02:40:23.469 --> 02:40:23.850]  Go ahead.
[02:40:25.311 --> 02:40:29.095]  Mr. Roberts, have you ever heard of a former military man named Jim Ammerman?
[02:40:29.535 --> 02:40:30.656]  Oh, yes.
[02:40:30.937 --> 02:40:37.803]  I think he's a wonderful speaker, and Alex, if you could ever speak with him on your show, I'm sure we'd all be delighted to hear it.
[02:40:40.109 --> 02:40:49.394]  I'd like to thank you, Alex, for bringing up that commercial that ran a few years ago with the guy in the overcoat filling his pockets and walking out and being stopped to have his receipt handed to him.
[02:40:49.414 --> 02:40:53.976]  I'd forgotten completely about that, and I appreciate you reminding me of that.
[02:40:54.076 --> 02:40:57.218]  Well, that's what the self-checkout is with the RFID.
[02:40:57.618 --> 02:40:59.379]  It's admitted to get rid of all the checkers.
[02:40:59.839 --> 02:41:06.122]  And then, like you said, they weren't selling anything except that they're putting forth this image of things to come.
[02:41:07.583 --> 02:41:08.964]  Alex, the one thing I wanted to ask you...
[02:41:10.066 --> 02:41:14.910]  My dad, his name was David Waters, and he was from Austin, Texas, where you're at.
[02:41:15.710 --> 02:41:17.591]  And he killed Madeline Murray O'Hare.
[02:41:17.792 --> 02:41:20.253]  And I've read as much as I could about that case.
[02:41:20.333 --> 02:41:25.217]  And is there anything that I should know that maybe you'd be privy to from being from that area?
[02:41:25.237 --> 02:41:27.679]  Because I know it was covered more thoroughly in Austin.
[02:41:27.719 --> 02:41:32.702]  You're going to have to stay there, Darren, because I'll talk to you on the other side.
[02:41:32.722 --> 02:41:33.543]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:35.931 --> 02:41:40.298]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:40.458 --> 02:41:44.905]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.045 --> 02:41:49.411]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:49.451 --> 02:41:50.813]  The New World Order.
[02:41:51.514 --> 02:41:52.555]  Can emerge.
[02:41:52.596 --> 02:41:56.820]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:03.808]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:42:03.948 --> 02:42:06.011]  You will lose your liberties.
[02:42:06.311 --> 02:42:16.695]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:16.935 --> 02:42:22.237]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:42:22.797 --> 02:42:28.802]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:42:28.922 --> 02:42:32.044]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:32.104 --> 02:42:33.085]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:33.426 --> 02:42:34.887]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:42:35.267 --> 02:42:37.229]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:42:37.329 --> 02:42:48.017]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:42:48.397 --> 02:42:52.943]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the black Berkey purification element.
[02:42:53.004 --> 02:43:04.339]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:43:04.919 --> 02:43:11.764]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:43:12.164 --> 02:43:14.306]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:43:14.806 --> 02:43:19.789]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:26.214]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-8034.
[02:43:28.355 --> 02:43:39.982]  Have you been tricked into believing that you can't hire or be hired without a social security number?
[02:43:40.002 --> 02:43:46.126]  Do you think that you can't bank, get a driver's license, or rent an apartment, or get insurance without a social security number?
[02:43:46.326 --> 02:43:49.168]  It seems everywhere you turn, somebody is asking for it.
[02:43:49.308 --> 02:43:56.692]  But did you know there is no law requiring you to obtain, have, or use a social security number to live or work in the United States?
[02:43:56.892 --> 02:43:57.413]  We're good to go.
[02:44:11.809 --> 02:44:12.449]  We're good to go.
[02:44:42.751 --> 02:44:43.995]  All right.
[02:44:44.015 --> 02:44:47.082]  Darren in Colorado.
[02:44:47.102 --> 02:44:50.009]  If you want to contact me sometime off air, email me or something...
[02:44:52.208 --> 02:44:54.689]  I'll try to sift through and find it and get in touch with you.
[02:44:54.890 --> 02:45:04.754]  But, I mean, the whole battle of Marie O'Hare case and how she was supposedly killed and then how that investigation went along, I don't know what to make of it.
[02:45:04.794 --> 02:45:06.034]  I don't know what the truth is.
[02:45:06.675 --> 02:45:13.858]  You probably know more about that than I do, but you're saying your father was the convicted killer?
[02:45:14.358 --> 02:45:14.898]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:14.978 --> 02:45:17.159]  He died in January.
[02:45:17.820 --> 02:45:20.801]  Just all of a sudden, he'd been put in Leavenworth.
[02:45:21.897 --> 02:45:24.358]  And suddenly he was deathly ill and died within a month.
[02:45:24.498 --> 02:45:27.159]  And it was very strange.
[02:45:27.220 --> 02:45:39.545]  It struck me as strange that a perfectly healthy man would just suddenly... Yeah, that whole case was they were out there at that ranch for months and, oh, they found something, oh, they hadn't.
[02:45:39.625 --> 02:45:49.630]  And just the way that the whole thing was being reported, it was very, very interesting.
[02:45:50.379 --> 02:45:53.301]  Yeah, he was in Leavenworth, struck deathly ill.
[02:45:53.441 --> 02:46:00.945]  All of a sudden, they shipped him off to North Carolina to their federal cancer brig or whatever they've got.
[02:46:00.965 --> 02:46:04.927]  I know they do a lot of bio and chemical testing on prisoners and people.
[02:46:04.947 --> 02:46:06.168]  I mean, that's admitted.
[02:46:06.188 --> 02:46:11.431]  They did it to troops, even in the mid-'80s in England, killing our troops knowingly.
[02:46:11.451 --> 02:46:12.272]  That's BBC.
[02:46:13.052 --> 02:46:14.413]  Colonel Roberts, can you speak to that?
[02:46:16.282 --> 02:46:29.065]  You know, I'm real familiar with the O'Hare case, and I don't know anything about what you're talking about right now, but I know that there was also a lot of money involved in this deal.
[02:46:29.805 --> 02:46:33.486]  And all the money disappeared, and there was a lot of gold involved, and all the gold disappeared.
[02:46:33.906 --> 02:46:35.206]  And it all happened like overnight.
[02:46:35.286 --> 02:46:36.746]  I don't know if they ever found any of that.
[02:46:36.827 --> 02:46:38.667]  So other than that, I really don't know much about it.
[02:46:39.167 --> 02:46:40.427]  Yeah, send me some info.
[02:46:40.447 --> 02:46:41.668]  I appreciate the call, Darren.
[02:46:41.968 --> 02:46:43.728]  Mike in Tennessee, real quick, go ahead.
[02:46:46.445 --> 02:46:48.186]  Appreciate you coming on the show, Mike.
[02:46:50.148 --> 02:46:50.788]  Okay.
[02:46:51.369 --> 02:46:51.689]  Hello?
[02:46:52.389 --> 02:46:52.930]  Go ahead.
[02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:53.750]  I'm here.
[02:46:54.411 --> 02:46:55.111]  Go ahead and talk.
[02:46:55.532 --> 02:46:55.792]  Okay.
[02:46:56.752 --> 02:47:00.915]  Colonel Roberts, I've enjoyed all your books, and your newest one was Walking Dead.
[02:47:02.156 --> 02:47:04.038]  That's the latest one?
[02:47:04.058 --> 02:47:07.720]  That's a reprint of one that came out several years ago, but it's just come back out again.
[02:47:08.181 --> 02:47:08.421]  Okay.
[02:47:08.821 --> 02:47:15.266]  Now, you mentioned something earlier about a radar shot from Long Island that showed that people...
[02:47:16.027 --> 02:47:16.867]  Yeah, your phone's bad.
[02:47:16.887 --> 02:47:18.028]  I'm going to have to let you go, Mike.
[02:47:18.728 --> 02:47:19.368]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:20.028 --> 02:47:25.930]  Craig, other comments on the power outage and the EMP bursts that you emailed to me that I'll be posting on Infowars.com?
[02:47:26.110 --> 02:47:29.171]  Yeah, I don't know much more than what we're going to see there, but it's something we need to look at.
[02:47:29.211 --> 02:47:33.553]  But before we run out of time, there is one last thing, and I want them to know they heard it here first.
[02:47:34.093 --> 02:47:37.954]  I just got this in, and I already knew something about this, but I just got some confirmation about it.
[02:47:38.404 --> 02:47:40.985]  And now they're claiming there's one also in Lebanon.
[02:47:56.634 --> 02:47:58.376]  Well, these two right now, we know about them.
[02:47:58.396 --> 02:48:02.639]  We knew about them a long time ago, and you and I discussed why haven't they just gone and shown that, hey, here they are.
[02:48:03.159 --> 02:48:04.400]  Well, they would lose effect.
[02:48:05.261 --> 02:48:08.723]  If you can find them just before the election, of course, it would make a big difference.
[02:48:08.744 --> 02:48:12.386]  Well, I've even heard Limbaugh brag that they've already found it and they're going to be showing it to people.
[02:48:12.406 --> 02:48:17.590]  Of course, also, they've got to go into them first and clean them out because a lot of them have U.S.-made chemicals in them.
[02:48:17.830 --> 02:48:19.972]  Well, I don't know about these two right here.
[02:48:20.012 --> 02:48:22.394]  We were watching these 10 years ago that I know of.
[02:48:22.714 --> 02:48:23.395]  At least one of them.
[02:48:23.415 --> 02:48:24.396]  It's inside of a mountain.
[02:48:24.456 --> 02:48:25.317]  It's been hollowed out.
[02:48:25.397 --> 02:48:31.282]  The other one is under the desert where they dug it at nighttime, not realizing that we had satellites to see at night.
[02:48:31.883 --> 02:48:32.463]  Absolutely.
[02:48:32.804 --> 02:48:34.105]  Pat, last caller.
[02:48:34.145 --> 02:48:34.905]  Go ahead real quick.
[02:48:35.966 --> 02:48:37.728]  Okay, Pat, we're not going to have time to go to Pat.
[02:48:38.148 --> 02:48:39.530]  I'm out of time, folks.
[02:48:40.655 --> 02:48:42.577]  And, Craig, I want to thank you for coming on the show.
[02:48:42.597 --> 02:48:43.298]  Take care, my friend.
[02:48:43.478 --> 02:48:43.798]  Thank you.
[02:48:43.838 --> 02:48:44.899]  RifleWarrior.com.
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:45.640]  All right.
[02:48:46.301 --> 02:48:47.922]  Absolutely great stuff.
[02:48:47.942 --> 02:48:51.886]  The new book's out, Order Out of Chaos, and it's on InfoWars.com.
[02:48:51.906 --> 02:48:57.032]  1995, 300-something pages covering government-sponsored terrorism in the New World Order.
