[00:00:02.894 --> 00:00:06.076]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:15.385]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:17.065]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:18.926]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:20.366]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:23.067]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.087 --> 00:00:26.528]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:30.970]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.794 --> 00:00:42.395]  All right, folks.
[00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:45.040]  It is Friday, the 30th already of May 2003.
[00:00:53.712 --> 00:01:11.963]  Yesterday I got, oh I got sidetracked talking about army checkpoints in Alabama diverting the entire traffic off the interstate into a checkpoint and black helicopters and torture and police state and kids thumb scanning to get their school lunches and what's happening with the economy.
[00:01:12.463 --> 00:01:15.285]  I didn't talk about a story that broke a couple days ago.
[00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:20.928]  Bill Clinton said he wanted to get rid of the 22nd Amendment so he can run again.
[00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:31.478]  But Republicans have introduced bills as well, so the princeling George W. from Kennebuckport, Maine can run again.
[00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:43.890]  And then I heard Dick Morris on the radio, Bill Clinton's former top advisor, political advisor, admitting some truthful things that Bill Clinton really wants George Bush to win and
[00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:46.392]  Folks, they're big buddies.
[00:01:46.452 --> 00:01:48.713]  This is totally and completely staged.
[00:01:48.773 --> 00:01:54.836]  George Bush is taking every Clinton policy and doubling it, quadrupling it in many cases.
[00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:57.957]  We'll talk about this double teaming that's taking place.
[00:01:58.337 --> 00:02:01.259]  We're probably actually going to see Hillary in there in 08.
[00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:08.942]  Before 08, probably by 06, you're going to see Bill Clinton as Secretary General.
[00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:14.085]  He'll then serve a eight-year term there and then run for President here.
[00:02:15.223 --> 00:02:20.548]  It's a frightening prospect, but we'll discuss the real political paradigm.
[00:02:20.928 --> 00:02:31.297]  I'll give you insightful analysis from my years of study on this subject and my predictions coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:32.638 --> 00:02:34.900]  So, stay with us on that issue.
[00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:36.553]  P.O.W.
[00:02:36.713 --> 00:02:38.956]  torture photos investigated.
[00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:43.080]  Allegations Iraqi prisoners of war were mistreated by U.K.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.206]  troops are being investigated after photographs allegedly showing the abuse were discovered.
[00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:51.169]  Kind of embarrassed the U.N.
[00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.653]  when those photos of barbecuing small children got released.
[00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:57.703]  That's what the globalists are all about.
[00:02:58.364 --> 00:03:00.524]  Iraqi mass murder, freed in mix-up.
[00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:06.266]  Oh, I guess like the 8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders that were freed in a mix-up by our government in Afghanistan.
[00:03:06.927 --> 00:03:11.908]  Anti-American anger at soldiers searching homes, gun confiscations in Iraq.
[00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.050]  They are burning and pillaging now police stations.
[00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.373]  Especially after our troops shot a bunch of people at a wedding procession because one of the Iraqis was firing a gun in the air, which they do.
[00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.731]  So it's Tiananmen Square every week over there now.
[00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:32.534]  Also, Ministry confirms that cluster bombs were used on civilian areas in Iraq.
[00:03:33.034 --> 00:03:33.214]  U.S.
[00:03:33.234 --> 00:03:34.976]  gunfire kills three teens at a wedding.
[00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:35.836]  Already mentioned that.
[00:03:37.557 --> 00:03:38.638]  Got a bunch of other news.
[00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.880]  Rumsfeld's new line on missing arms.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.182]  They say, hey, we never said there was weapons of mass destruction.
[00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:45.103]  He actually says that.
[00:03:45.463 --> 00:03:47.004]  And never said we needed to find them.
[00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:52.650]  Wolfowitz says it's purely bureaucratic and that no weapons need be found.
[00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:59.316]  Also, we're going to get into more of the fake dossiers that they were putting out.
[00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:00.958]  U.S.
[00:04:00.998 --> 00:04:08.905]  military plan against Iran, recently released, and Rumsfeld says they need to go ahead and invade Iran or somebody's gonna nuke us.
[00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:13.850]  So see now, overnight, well yesterday on Fox & Friends, the question was in the morning,
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.722]  Time for talking or time for tomahawking?
[00:04:18.203 --> 00:04:18.743]  I ran!
[00:04:18.763 --> 00:04:23.728]  And they opened the phones up to stage calls, screen calls, saying, Time for tomahawking!
[00:04:23.788 --> 00:04:25.089]  Time for tomahawking!
[00:04:25.549 --> 00:04:26.930]  Kill them with the tomahawks!
[00:04:28.612 --> 00:04:37.900]  So that'll be the 61st country, 61 on the list to be hit, and they told you 62 countries to be hit, and they're moving on down the line.
[00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:41.203]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:43.960]  Turns out there was no bunker where U.S.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.041]  bombs targeted Saddam.
[00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:46.662]  Well, of course, that was all staged.
[00:04:46.702 --> 00:04:48.083]  They've already flown him out of the country.
[00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:52.106]  Rumsfeld now publicly says invasion of Iran is needed.
[00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:54.168]  Big show!
[00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:56.310]  Got a couple guests coming up as well.
[00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.112]  Big show today!
[00:05:00.272 --> 00:05:01.193]  Big show today!
[00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:06.177]  Stay with me on this live Friday edition.
[00:05:06.517 --> 00:05:07.898]  Infowars.com
[00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:15.862]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[00:05:16.002 --> 00:05:20.385]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:25.069]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:28.211]  There are no moving parts, and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:33.135]  It works for just pennies a day, with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:37.238]  Made of the finest materials, it has a 2-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[00:05:37.518 --> 00:05:39.920]  And the Aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.103]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:49.526]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[00:05:49.726 --> 00:05:52.668]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[00:05:52.828 --> 00:05:54.710]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.553]  For more information about the Aeronizer, call Toll Free and tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[00:05:59.733 --> 00:06:02.914]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:04.955]  That's 877-605-9200.
[00:06:05.015 --> 00:06:17.799]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:22.820]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.682]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:33.446]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:40.834]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:40.854 --> 00:06:44.377]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:45.358]  And much, much more.
[00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:48.060]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:55.027]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:06:55.227 --> 00:07:00.492]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:00.512 --> 00:07:00.912]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:09.264 --> 00:07:10.005]  Are you prepared?
[00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:12.589]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:17.255]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[00:07:17.555 --> 00:07:21.020]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.403]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[00:07:24.104 --> 00:07:28.107]  Jerry Deddy from the Ark Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[00:07:28.327 --> 00:07:31.270]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:38.476]  Call the Ark Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[00:07:38.696 --> 00:07:44.000]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.284]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[00:07:49.505 --> 00:07:50.525]  Jerry can help here too.
[00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:56.010]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.153]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[00:08:00.274 --> 00:08:02.195]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll free 1-800-255-1912.
[00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:03.256]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com.
[00:08:14.686 --> 00:08:15.327]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.987 --> 00:08:17.048]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:18.870]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:20.332]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.092 --> 00:08:21.973]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:21.993 --> 00:08:26.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.838 --> 00:08:30.903]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.887 --> 00:08:34.787]  Absolutely!
[00:08:34.947 --> 00:08:40.229]  We are the leader in real information, in true analysis.
[00:08:40.649 --> 00:08:49.972]  You don't hear the mindless infighting on this show, the conspiracy theories, the issues of little or no significance you hear on some of the other so-called Patriot Talk shows.
[00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:53.594]  We certainly cut to the lies of the false left-right paradigm.
[00:08:54.194 --> 00:08:57.755]  So go ahead folks, stay with us and keep up with the Joneses.
[00:08:58.618 --> 00:09:21.509]  We'll be live for the next two hours and fifty minutes and we're going to take a lot of calls today on this Open Line Friday and I do have one of the senior people from the War Crimes Court over in Belgium coming on just so you can hear the evidence of the mass murder.
[00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:25.411]  Now last Friday I had a doctor on
[00:09:26.337 --> 00:09:31.779]  Who had been there and seen Marines kill children and then chant, we love killing children, we love it.
[00:09:32.979 --> 00:09:34.940]  And this evidence is all over the foreign press.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.021]  Photos, videos of it, you name it.
[00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:40.902]  Well now I've got the prosecutor coming on.
[00:09:41.542 --> 00:09:43.423]  And of course the court is illegitimate.
[00:09:43.723 --> 00:09:48.625]  Anything that goes over the head of a sovereign country is illegitimate, but it's the evidence we want to look at.
[00:09:48.645 --> 00:09:52.226]  Now it's not a UN court, it's a Belgian war crimes court.
[00:09:53.046 --> 00:09:54.427]  Probably already heard a lot about that.
[00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:59.236]  But that's coming up with some new information for you.
[00:09:59.256 --> 00:10:01.978]  And of course we're going to open the phones up.
[00:10:02.038 --> 00:10:17.006]  And I'm working on getting one of the, either for or against, some of the school board people on from up in Ohio, where they're putting in the thumb scanners for the kids to buy their school lunches.
[00:10:17.046 --> 00:10:18.347]  Now it's happening all over the country, but
[00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:27.706]  Here they spent $700,000 to do it, to train your children for the Casual Society system, training them how to get into the system, getting them into the system.
[00:10:27.746 --> 00:10:30.369]  It's a Pavlovian training mechanism.
[00:10:30.409 --> 00:10:31.850]  So that's all coming up as well.
[00:10:33.098 --> 00:10:49.270]  Before I get into POW torture photos investigated and what's happening over in Iraq and the total breakdown of the society which is being done by design to further extend the occupation of that oil producing and military launch base for the New World Order.
[00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.814]  Before I do this, at the end of the show yesterday I mentioned this, but I didn't spend enough time on it.
[00:10:56.022 --> 00:11:01.426]  It is of great importance that Bill Clinton wants to repeal the 22nd Amendment.
[00:11:01.887 --> 00:11:14.717]  That's the amendment to the Constitution passed after Roosevelt, saying that a president cannot run and win and get into office more than two four-year terms.
[00:11:16.588 --> 00:11:37.552]  Now, the funny thing is, when Bill Clinton, six months before the election started, about a year before Clinton left office, Henry Hyde, the guy who just tried to impeach Bill Clinton, well, who had gotten the indictment in the House, and then in the Senate, Bill Clinton used blackmail and threats, according to David Shippers, the head prosecutor, to go after people.
[00:11:38.612 --> 00:11:43.873]  We've had Shippers on the show about that, and about Bush's prior knowledge of 9-1-1, of course, but that's a separate issue.
[00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:53.272]  And Hyde came out and tried to get the 22nd Amendment repeal as if they could do that with a law in Congress.
[00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:54.172]  They claimed they could.
[00:11:55.712 --> 00:11:57.273]  I thought it would take a constitutional convention.
[00:11:58.413 --> 00:12:02.495]  But they tried it and people said, oh my gosh, Bill Clinton's going to try to stay in office.
[00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:04.035]  This is incredible.
[00:12:04.095 --> 00:12:05.215]  And I said, no, no, no.
[00:12:06.096 --> 00:12:09.697]  The law they're trying to pass says for five years
[00:12:11.485 --> 00:12:14.087]  They can come in and vote for a law.
[00:12:14.547 --> 00:12:21.211]  And they did get it ready, and all it would do was prepare the passage for five years.
[00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:22.772]  That's what the specific bill said.
[00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:35.420]  Well, now, a Republican and a Democrat have entered two different bills in the House and Senate, which will repeal the 22nd Amendment, and you've got Bill Clinton saying he wants to get rid of it.
[00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:41.190]  Now, Bill Clinton wants to basically be George Bush Sr.
[00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.451]  and George Bush Jr.
[00:12:42.571 --> 00:12:48.993]  and Jeb Bush all rolled into one, because that's the political dynasty that we have set up.
[00:12:49.053 --> 00:12:50.833]  That's how they're setting the runs up here.
[00:12:51.173 --> 00:12:54.094]  King George I, King George II, King George III.
[00:12:54.414 --> 00:12:57.155]  Bill Clinton just wants to embody all of that himself.
[00:12:57.794 --> 00:13:06.959]  And it doesn't matter one iota because they will trade off power in this stage left-right theater that they're demonstrating for the general public.
[00:13:07.859 --> 00:13:08.560]  That's all it is.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.821]  And I heard Dick Morris on the radio yesterday admit it.
[00:13:12.622 --> 00:13:16.363]  They said, Dick Morris coming up next, and I thought this will be a bunch of propaganda and lies.
[00:13:16.884 --> 00:13:21.646]  And the guy is so oily, such a snake, you can hear him hissing on the other end of the line.
[00:13:22.266 --> 00:13:24.408]  But the guy comes on and admits the truth!
[00:13:24.868 --> 00:13:26.949]  Bill Clinton wants George Bush to win,
[00:13:28.005 --> 00:13:33.508]  That's why he bad-mouthed the other Democrats in the 2000 election, probably losing the election for Gore.
[00:13:35.308 --> 00:13:37.669]  Bill Clinton really kind of buddies with the Bushes.
[00:13:37.689 --> 00:13:39.330]  This is all a staged deal.
[00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.551]  It will be Hillary in 2008.
[00:13:42.451 --> 00:13:44.072]  And it was incredible.
[00:13:44.993 --> 00:13:53.076]  Now what Morris didn't mention, he's a Republican of course, working for Clinton in the past, admitting that this is staged.
[00:13:53.176 --> 00:13:54.837]  But what people don't tell you is
[00:13:55.583 --> 00:14:12.732]  There were 11 meetings from 90 to 92 between former CIA Director George Herbert Walker Bush, the current president at the time, and Bill Clinton, William Jefferson Clinton, Clintonista, the illegitimate Rockefeller prodigy there.
[00:14:14.032 --> 00:14:15.413]  They had this staged event.
[00:14:15.993 --> 00:14:24.558]  Bush couldn't get tax increases through, he couldn't get a ban on assault weapons through, he couldn't sell it, he couldn't sell his New World Order to conservatives.
[00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.711]  And so they had a staged event.
[00:14:26.751 --> 00:14:29.292]  They were business partners at MENA Arkansas, this is admitted.
[00:14:29.812 --> 00:14:38.377]  They were involved together on a hundred fronts, arming the Communist Chinese, Rumsfeld arming nuclear reactors in North Korea during Bill Clinton's tenure.
[00:14:38.997 --> 00:14:40.018]  All this was happening!
[00:14:40.258 --> 00:14:41.358]  This is a fact, folks!
[00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:44.040]  And so they had that staged event.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.341]  The conservatives were still going to vote for Bush.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:15:02.324]  And so, but there was this big fissure in this division, so they brought a ringer in, H. Ross Perot, who's with them, got his first contract from Nelson Rockefeller in New York, next contract from the CIA for data management with EDS.
[00:15:02.804 --> 00:15:04.605]  He makes 90% of his money off the government.
[00:15:04.805 --> 00:15:08.626]  They bring this ringer in, who's going to be on the 10-member health care secret board.
[00:15:09.686 --> 00:15:13.327]  He attacks Bush in a staged event, and so they get Bill Clinton in.
[00:15:14.432 --> 00:15:24.524]  So they advance the agenda with the liberals, then they switch over, switch hitters folks, is what they are, as they destroy our liberties, they switch over to Bill Clinton and back and forth.
[00:15:26.104 --> 00:15:27.064]  This is how they do it.
[00:15:27.525 --> 00:15:43.049]  The actual actions, crippling the size of the BATF, expanding the Department of Education, open borders, NAFTA and GATT, globalism, transferring supercomputers, nuclear reactors, arming enemies, taking our liberties, expanding the power of the federal government.
[00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.550]  They're all on the same page.
[00:15:46.871 --> 00:15:48.691]  And so this is how they're getting their agenda through.
[00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:53.693]  And there was Dick Morris admitting this, I was about to fall over, but here is
[00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:57.918]  An article that I didn't really cover yesterday out of World Net Daily.
[00:15:59.099 --> 00:16:01.039]  Now, I've been ranting and raving about this.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:12.684]  The Republicans come to power, I'm sitting back going, George Bush is the son of Mr. New World Order, Mr. CIA Director, Mr. Ambassador to China, Mr. Head U.N.
[00:16:12.724 --> 00:16:18.226]  Ambassador, his daddy's been all those things, CIA Section Chief in Dealey,
[00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:20.868]  Plaza in Dallas in 1963.
[00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:25.933]  That's, you know, quite a resume for Mr. Skellen Bones, George Herbert Walker.
[00:16:27.535 --> 00:16:31.059]  And so, you know, I'm saying, okay, let's just see what Bush does.
[00:16:31.099 --> 00:16:36.745]  Well, he comes out of the gate and says, I'm going to take over the churches with faith-based initiatives, open borders.
[00:16:38.635 --> 00:16:40.076]  And I'm not going to go after Bill Clinton.
[00:16:40.096 --> 00:16:41.557]  I'm going to block Dan Burton's committee.
[00:16:41.597 --> 00:16:43.278]  I mean, they could have arrested Bill Clinton.
[00:16:43.598 --> 00:16:47.181]  This guy was pardoning convicted cocaine dealers and taking money from them.
[00:16:47.221 --> 00:16:47.861]  That's illegal.
[00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:49.803]  They can pardon them, they just can't take money from them.
[00:16:50.783 --> 00:16:54.086]  Taking money from convicted money launderers and arms traffickers.
[00:16:55.407 --> 00:16:56.507]  This is all out in the open.
[00:16:57.748 --> 00:17:01.971]  Bill Clinton could be behind bars right now, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:17:02.492 --> 00:17:03.953]  George Bush says, you know what?
[00:17:04.713 --> 00:17:07.315]  We've got one more vote than the Democrats in the Senate.
[00:17:09.918 --> 00:17:11.980]  But we're going to go ahead and give them 50-50.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.521]  Never happened before.
[00:17:13.841 --> 00:17:16.022]  Bush ordered the Republicans to give them 50-50.
[00:17:16.243 --> 00:17:21.486]  Then they had Jeffords switch in that staged event to give the Democrats control of the Senate.
[00:17:21.566 --> 00:17:22.927]  Now that was totally staged, folks.
[00:17:22.947 --> 00:17:23.408]  They admit it.
[00:17:24.889 --> 00:17:27.551]  Then Bush says, we're not going after Bill Clinton.
[00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:28.551]  We're moving forward.
[00:17:30.093 --> 00:17:33.435]  He ordered Dan Burton to drop it and the federal prosecutors won't help Burton.
[00:17:34.699 --> 00:17:35.179]  Here it is.
[00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:37.441]  Bush looking forward, not at pardon gate.
[00:17:37.841 --> 00:17:41.243]  Spokesman questioned about probe into Clinton clemencies.
[00:17:42.443 --> 00:17:43.384]  And this was from yesterday.
[00:17:43.424 --> 00:17:44.625]  Today's White House News Briefing.
[00:17:44.645 --> 00:17:45.145]  We're on that daily.
[00:17:45.185 --> 00:17:49.687]  Asked Presidential Secretary Ari Fleischer about the failure of the U.S.
[00:17:49.727 --> 00:17:54.290]  Attorney in charge of investigating President Clinton's last minute pardons to issue a report.
[00:17:55.431 --> 00:17:56.051]  We're on that daily.
[00:17:56.091 --> 00:18:01.234]  The Gallup Poll has just reported that on the question, who do you regard as the greatest president,
[00:18:02.188 --> 00:18:04.829]  Bill Clinton is tied with President Bush.
[00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:08.871]  That shows you what these polls really are, and it shows you how sick things are.
[00:18:09.472 --> 00:18:17.376]  Bush for the third, at 11%, receiving more votes than three of the four presidents on Mount Rushmore, and more votes than President Reagan.
[00:18:18.756 --> 00:18:25.180]  And my question, does the President, as the nation's chief law enforcer, still believe it is wise and just to tolerate the U.S.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:25.640]  Attorney?
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.700]  Tolerate?
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.621]  Oh, see, Bush is tolerating.
[00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:29.522]  See, it's an accident.
[00:18:29.742 --> 00:18:31.763]  Bush has said he's leaving Clinton alone.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:38.505]  The Southern District of New York, not even giving a report on the three-year-old criminal investigation of President Clinton's pardon gate.
[00:18:38.885 --> 00:18:42.447]  And here's the comments from the Press Secretary, Fleischer.
[00:18:43.308 --> 00:18:48.732]  Lester, this is one of the most bizarre bank shots I have ever heard.
[00:18:48.832 --> 00:18:52.235]  Lafker, again when he asks about President Clinton's pardon gate.
[00:18:52.815 --> 00:18:54.877]  Ronet Daily, has there been any report
[00:18:55.794 --> 00:18:56.715]  He was charged.
[00:18:56.775 --> 00:18:58.016]  It's a criminal investigation.
[00:18:58.076 --> 00:18:58.577]  Pardon Gate.
[00:18:58.717 --> 00:18:59.137]  Pleasure.
[00:18:59.598 --> 00:19:01.880]  The President is looking forwards, not backwards.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.704]  And I would highly recommend that you too, as well.
[00:19:06.484 --> 00:19:07.065]  Roland Daly.
[00:19:07.405 --> 00:19:09.627]  He's just got to just drop it.
[00:19:09.968 --> 00:19:11.309]  It's just been dropped, right?
[00:19:11.569 --> 00:19:11.990]  Pleasure.
[00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:16.614]  If you're asking judicial questions, you know the appropriate people to ask.
[00:19:17.535 --> 00:19:18.516]  And it goes on and on.
[00:19:19.957 --> 00:19:20.198]  So,
[00:19:21.488 --> 00:19:30.272]  You know, people out there, when you listen to these neocons, they'll make fun of stupid liberals with moron policies and the useful idiot low-level people.
[00:19:31.513 --> 00:19:33.194]  They don't talk about real substance.
[00:19:33.254 --> 00:19:36.895]  This is totally and completely staged.
[00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:40.177]  Remember, Bush is going to sign that assault weapons ban of Clinton's.
[00:19:40.377 --> 00:19:44.139]  They're going to reauthorize, and I've read what they're actually saying, folks.
[00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:45.960]  It's a lie that Ola isn't going to pass.
[00:19:47.825 --> 00:19:48.606]  It's got a good chance.
[00:19:48.786 --> 00:20:01.420]  Bush says he'll sign it with the semi-automatic shotgun ban in it, with the gun show shutdown, with the... Folks, you want the most gun control ever seen, something Bill Clinton would never get away with, fine.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.722]  Don't listen to this show.
[00:20:03.322 --> 00:20:08.008]  If you really love liberty and the Bill of Rights, wake up people now!
[00:20:08.108 --> 00:20:08.809]  We're losing it!

[00:23:10.151 --> 00:23:12.753]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:23:13.013 --> 00:23:18.757]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:23:18.998 --> 00:23:20.359]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:23:20.459 --> 00:23:24.161]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:30.386]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[00:23:30.526 --> 00:23:33.008]  The two most important protein superfoods known.
[00:23:33.328 --> 00:23:42.980]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water, normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.485]  It's also very hydrating, and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[00:23:48.006 --> 00:23:51.610]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease,
[00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:56.172]  Listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley, Sunday evenings at 6 p.m.

[00:24:22.863 --> 00:24:29.486]  Central Standard Time and then back from 9 to midnight I'm here folks and then of course we broadcast the daytime show from 1 a.m.
[00:24:29.506 --> 00:24:30.346]  until 4 a.m.
[00:24:30.667 --> 00:24:33.608]  so nine hours a day on the Alex Jones Show no matter what shift you're on or
[00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:38.391]  What part of the day you're awake you can tune in to the worldwide broadcast.
[00:24:38.411 --> 00:24:42.093]  During the day we're on shortwave from 11 to 2 on 12.172 or 93.20 and back from 9 to midnight at 5.085 or 68.90.
[00:24:42.173 --> 00:24:44.955]  Coming up we have the president of the of the school council of the school board
[00:24:56.779 --> 00:25:02.782]  Talking about the $700,000 thumb scanners for the kids to get their school lunches coming on the show.
[00:25:02.802 --> 00:25:06.984]  If you don't like it, you can just pack a lunch is the new system training them for this.
[00:25:07.685 --> 00:25:09.546]  I said I'd talk about the real plan.
[00:25:10.846 --> 00:25:19.451]  Now we've demonstrated here that Bush is ramming through what could only be called the Bill Clinton New World Order agenda on steroids.
[00:25:20.402 --> 00:25:23.103]  But it's obvious that it isn't Bill Clinton or George Bush's agenda.
[00:25:23.403 --> 00:25:27.405]  It's the globalist, destruction of liberty and freedom, world empire agenda.
[00:25:28.706 --> 00:25:33.448]  And so what you're going to have is Bush elected in 2004.
[00:25:34.408 --> 00:25:39.530]  You're then going to have Hillary Clinton, or some other creature, put into power in 2008.
[00:25:40.771 --> 00:25:46.193]  And long before them, in the next two years, Clinton's already lined up most of the G8 countries.
[00:25:46.213 --> 00:25:47.374]  She's got six of the eight.
[00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:50.991]  To be Secretary General in the next two years.
[00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:55.172]  Clinton will serve as Secretary General for eight to ten years until Hillary leaves.
[00:25:55.532 --> 00:25:57.412]  He will then come back and be President here.
[00:25:58.293 --> 00:26:08.035]  So we'll have Bush and Clinton double teaming us and then we'll have Hillary Clinton in there while Clinton is a Secretary General.
[00:26:08.996 --> 00:26:09.976]  So understand
[00:26:10.603 --> 00:26:19.769]  For the last two years, for sure, probably the last three to four, you'll have Bill Clinton as Secretary General when George W. is President.
[00:26:20.689 --> 00:26:22.290]  Then Hillary will come in, and U.N.
[00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.471]  Secretary Generals usually serve eight to ten years.
[00:26:24.892 --> 00:26:29.234]  You will then have Hillary as President with Clinton as Secretary General.
[00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:38.400]  And by then, the left, of course, will love all the government-sponsored terrorism, will suddenly won't be able to see the government's carrying it out like they are on Bush.
[00:26:39.582 --> 00:26:40.663]  Able to see he's doing it.
[00:26:42.084 --> 00:26:46.807]  And they'll be loving all the FEMA training that's been expanded under Bush.
[00:26:46.847 --> 00:26:49.749]  That Christians, gun owners, homeschoolers are terrorists.
[00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:50.750]  It actually says that.
[00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.392]  News articles and clips of video in my film The Road to Tyranny.
[00:26:55.633 --> 00:26:59.295]  So that's the reality of what we're facing right now.
[00:27:00.256 --> 00:27:01.297]  And that's what you're going to have.
[00:27:02.377 --> 00:27:07.281]  And you're going to have your guns at a gun club by the time Hillary's in office.
[00:27:07.301 --> 00:27:09.242]  You'll have to go check them out at a hunting club.
[00:27:10.211 --> 00:27:11.692]  And there's going to be more and more terror.
[00:27:11.752 --> 00:27:13.654]  It's going to escalate and get worse and worse.
[00:27:14.534 --> 00:27:17.196]  And the phony right wing will all be behind it.
[00:27:17.216 --> 00:27:18.858]  The phony left wing will all be behind it.
[00:27:20.679 --> 00:27:21.360]  And the U.N.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.562]  will be controlled by Clinton and the presidency by Hillary.
[00:27:25.983 --> 00:27:35.690]  And now there's discussions that after Hillary has served her two terms, that by, I guess what,
[00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:41.757]  Twelve years from now, you will then have Bill Clinton back in.
[00:27:41.817 --> 00:27:46.379]  So this is the new system for you and your family.
[00:27:47.779 --> 00:27:48.820]  Political dynasties.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.681]  I mean, it should worry everyone that we have the son of a president as the president.
[00:27:54.461 --> 00:27:57.242]  It's like North Korea or something, where we have hereditary leaders.
[00:27:58.243 --> 00:28:00.743]  And then we'll have the Clintons back in.
[00:28:01.003 --> 00:28:06.005]  And it's just all the same agenda, the same people, working for the same set of goals.
[00:28:08.531 --> 00:28:10.975]  And they're not running anything, really, in reality.
[00:28:11.035 --> 00:28:16.865]  It's the military-industrial complex running this entire mammoth system.
[00:28:21.172 --> 00:28:24.075]  The question is, what are you going to do about it?
[00:28:24.315 --> 00:28:26.418]  Well, you've got to break the political paradigm.
[00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:34.406]  You've got to get down past the rhetoric to the actual actions of these administrations and realize what they truly are.
[00:28:34.886 --> 00:28:39.151]  You've got to focus where you can have an effect in your county, your city, your neighborhood.
[00:28:40.086 --> 00:28:46.711]  You've got to get elected as dog catcher, or constable, or sheriff, or county commissioner, or city council member.
[00:28:47.211 --> 00:28:49.693]  You've got to use those platforms to educate people.
[00:28:49.713 --> 00:28:53.055]  You've got to stop the federal touchscreen systems going in.
[00:28:53.475 --> 00:28:58.759]  Even the liberals and conservatives, the grassroots, are now pointing out these are totally fraud-ridden, run by the federal government.
[00:28:59.955 --> 00:29:04.579]  You've got to stop the biometrics going in your grocery stores and banks for that cashless society.
[00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:06.040]  Tracking surveillance grid.
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.402]  You've got to shut down the borders.
[00:29:08.422 --> 00:29:11.344]  80 plus percent of Americans are for it, including Hispanics.
[00:29:11.364 --> 00:29:13.926]  It's not a racial issue as the media tries to make it.
[00:29:14.706 --> 00:29:21.212]  You've got to stop the phony environmental movement that's taking private property rights and stop calling them environmentalist wackos because they're not.
[00:29:21.252 --> 00:29:24.214]  They're organized criminals that know exactly what they're doing.
[00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:27.331]  You've got to get us out of the UN.
[00:29:27.351 --> 00:29:35.153]  You've got to point out that they're giving us two false choices of a liberal New World Order or a conservative New World Order, and point out we don't want a New World Order, period.
[00:29:35.873 --> 00:29:38.614]  This has to be done now.
[00:29:39.114 --> 00:29:47.337]  You've got to grow up, put your thinking cap on, figure out what's happening, expose who's behind the terror, or they're going to keep using it
[00:29:48.965 --> 00:29:57.573]  To destroy your future, to take your pension funds, to wreck this nation, to privatize everything that is not free market, that is organized crime.
[00:29:58.034 --> 00:29:58.775]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.536 --> 00:30:01.517]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.918 --> 00:30:03.579]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.599 --> 00:30:07.143]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.882 --> 00:30:16.746]  Some people believe a group of wealthy men control political parties, the American media, and the wealth of our nation.
[00:30:17.186 --> 00:30:17.867]  Is this true?
[00:30:18.447 --> 00:30:23.230]  Dr. Stanley Monteith spent 40 years studying... 8-8-8-0-3-44-38 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:30:23.271 --> 00:30:24.111]  That's triple 8-8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:24.591]  Protect your family.
[00:30:34.761 --> 00:30:40.846]  Defending liberty, resisting tyranny, exposing Republicans and Democrats in their destruction of our freedoms.
[00:30:40.946 --> 00:30:41.567]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:53.326 --> 00:31:00.672]  Now, in 97, I was arrested protesting the DPS thumb scanners that had been federally funded and put in in Texas.
[00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:02.193]  I read the federal plan.
[00:31:02.213 --> 00:31:04.414]  They said to buy at grocery stores and banks.
[00:31:04.795 --> 00:31:05.775]  You will have to do it.
[00:31:05.815 --> 00:31:06.956]  You will be tracked and traced.
[00:31:07.056 --> 00:31:09.858]  Everything you buy uploaded to Echelon.
[00:31:09.878 --> 00:31:12.641]  That's the Pentagon and the National Security Agency.
[00:31:12.661 --> 00:31:13.841]  This is their official documents.
[00:31:15.222 --> 00:31:19.025]  And you can see me being arrested, of course, in my film, America Destroyed by Design, with 100 protesters.
[00:31:22.174 --> 00:31:28.059]  And they get into how they're going to tax and trace and control you, and how they wanted to put it into schools to prepare you for that.
[00:31:28.139 --> 00:31:32.423]  Now, thousands of school districts from the United Kingdom to the United States are doing it.
[00:31:32.843 --> 00:31:34.945]  Dozens of school districts in Texas are doing it.
[00:31:36.507 --> 00:31:37.928]  Training the children how to be prisoners.
[00:31:38.723 --> 00:31:45.104]  This is a story, and we're about to go to our guests, I appreciate joining us, on the Akron School Board OK's Fingerprint System.
[00:31:45.644 --> 00:31:51.085]  Story out of the Beacon Journal by Stephanie Warsmith.
[00:31:51.205 --> 00:31:53.246]  Students will scan for meals.
[00:31:53.766 --> 00:31:58.187]  Akron students will be fingerprinted beginning this fall to identify them in school lunch lines.
[00:31:58.287 --> 00:32:01.507]  After a lengthy debate, school board members voted 5-2 Tuesday to spend $700,000.
[00:32:01.547 --> 00:32:02.387]  Man, with all the cuts.
[00:32:06.668 --> 00:32:19.975]  On a controversial modernized cafeteria system, board members Rebecca Hemmingbaugh and Mary Stormer voted no, mirroring the concerns of parents about the cost and privacy issues involving fingerprinting students.
[00:32:21.936 --> 00:32:23.997]  And it goes on and on here.
[00:32:24.057 --> 00:32:26.498]  You now know this is Total Information Awareness Network, folks.
[00:32:26.518 --> 00:32:28.899]  This is all part of training the kids, the teachers, the public.
[00:32:28.939 --> 00:32:29.760]  This is what happens.
[00:32:30.828 --> 00:32:47.641]  I do not believe that any parent or student has ever had the expectation that in order to go for the lunch line or to buy a cookie or a carton of milk, that they or their children would be requested to first be fingerprinted, said Hemingbaugh, who says she will probably refuse to have her three children in the Akron schools fingerprinted.
[00:32:48.782 --> 00:32:55.087]  And there's also criticisms here by Mary Stormer, who is on the school board.
[00:32:56.064 --> 00:32:57.465]  I believe the head of the school board.
[00:32:58.185 --> 00:33:00.706]  Mary Stormer, it is great to have you on the show today.
[00:33:00.726 --> 00:33:01.527]  Thank you for coming on.
[00:33:01.787 --> 00:33:02.427]  Hi, thanks.
[00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:03.368]  It's great to be here.
[00:33:03.948 --> 00:33:10.031]  I don't know if you're aware of the history of biometrics, but maybe you've heard about the Total Information Awareness Network in the news?
[00:33:10.331 --> 00:33:11.091]  Absolutely.
[00:33:11.412 --> 00:33:13.953]  Well, I have the plans from 93.
[00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:16.094]  They're integrating these.
[00:33:16.114 --> 00:33:18.295]  They're now going in our grocery stores here in Texas.
[00:33:18.375 --> 00:33:20.476]  It's into the state and federal database.
[00:33:23.075 --> 00:33:26.096]  This is obviously a Pavlovian psychological training mechanism.
[00:33:27.937 --> 00:33:30.578]  Tell us about how this happened in your school district.
[00:33:31.319 --> 00:33:43.664]  Well, the federal government subsidizes our lunch program, as they do in all school districts, for children that are in certain, well, lower socioeconomic status that qualify for free and reduced lunch.
[00:33:44.545 --> 00:33:49.627]  And you have to fill out paperwork in order to qualify to get the subsidized lunch.
[00:33:50.219 --> 00:33:53.500]  So, this was brought to us as a more efficient way.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.460]  We are a big city school district.
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:34:00.362]  We have about 30,000 students and we have 58 school buildings.
[00:34:00.522 --> 00:34:01.982]  But now it's for all the kids.
[00:34:02.582 --> 00:34:02.863]  Pardon?
[00:34:03.543 --> 00:34:05.023]  The article says it's for all the children.
[00:34:05.063 --> 00:34:06.524]  Well, it will be for all the kids.
[00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:08.264]  See, of course, yes.
[00:34:08.444 --> 00:34:15.706]  So anyway, normally, children that are on free and reduced lunch buy a lunch ticket and they use the lunch ticket to purchase their lunch.
[00:34:15.866 --> 00:34:18.807]  Well, in order to, allegedly, this is what they're saying,
[00:34:19.426 --> 00:34:26.168]  To reduce the stigma associated with free and reduced lunch, which is about 43% of our student population.
[00:34:26.228 --> 00:34:27.749]  Oh, it's for the children now.
[00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:32.290]  It's for, in order to reduce, yes, it's for the children.
[00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:41.393]  But really, the other thing that is disconcerting to me is the fact that they can track, find out a lot of information about students' parents.
[00:34:44.017 --> 00:34:47.798]  No, it didn't say this in the article, but I said this yesterday because I've read the plan.
[00:34:48.238 --> 00:34:51.279]  You mentioned, as I said, the Feds were involved because I've seen it in other areas.
[00:34:51.319 --> 00:34:53.080]  We can only use this money.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.800]  It's $700,000, which is a lot of money.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.680]  It's ridiculous.
[00:34:57.121 --> 00:35:02.042]  But we can only use it to put in place a more efficient means of
[00:35:03.528 --> 00:35:11.731]  Yeah, and for those that don't know, if the parent doesn't do things properly, they then of course get into the Child Protective Services roles.
[00:35:11.751 --> 00:35:13.652]  This is a spy system.
[00:35:13.692 --> 00:35:14.332]  Please continue.
[00:35:14.813 --> 00:35:18.514]  Well, so anyway, they did this saying that it would be more efficient.
[00:35:18.614 --> 00:35:26.137]  Well, you know, and that, this is the funny part, so they were explaining to us that they're not going to actually keep the fingerprint.
[00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:32.200]  They just identify certain points on the finger and then those points are converted into a binary
[00:35:33.493 --> 00:35:39.596]  number that goes into the information system so when it scans the kids identified.
[00:35:39.656 --> 00:35:50.880]  Well, I just looked at our head of food services and I said, well isn't that how they use fingerprint identification, identifying certain points on the fingerprint?
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.801]  So, anyway, she wasn't sure about that.
[00:35:53.861 --> 00:35:57.963]  Let me stop you because they have consultants for the government that go around
[00:35:58.886 --> 00:36:05.026]  With the local news agencies on CBS here when they started putting the thumb scanners in the grocery store on CBS News.
[00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:15.229]  They have the head of Biometric Access, a company in Round Rock, north of Austin, saying, oh, we don't keep your fingerprints when you get your food at the grocery store.
[00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:17.651]  It's just zeros and ones.
[00:36:17.691 --> 00:36:20.954]  Well, I mean, folks, that's what digital TV is, a zero and ones.
[00:36:21.294 --> 00:36:23.416]  That's what a digital photo on your computer is.
[00:36:23.496 --> 00:36:30.502]  It's like... Well, I gotta tell you, it'd be pretty creepy to me to go to the grocery store, get my fingerprint or my thumbprint scanned,
[00:36:30.962 --> 00:36:34.567]  And then start getting coupons for things that I purchased on a regular basis.
[00:36:34.607 --> 00:36:35.528]  Oh, they admit that.
[00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:36.569]  But see, let me stop you here.
[00:36:36.609 --> 00:36:38.532]  But this is the point I'm trying to make.
[00:36:38.572 --> 00:36:40.815]  The incredible lawyer type lies here.
[00:36:41.596 --> 00:36:46.598]  That's what computers are, are zeros and ones and points on a finger and a calculation.
[00:36:46.638 --> 00:36:47.679]  It is an image.
[00:36:47.719 --> 00:36:48.639]  I've studied biometrics.
[00:36:48.719 --> 00:36:51.461]  It is a digital photo of the thumb.
[00:36:51.561 --> 00:36:55.122]  It then calculates and creates a digital barcode off the human.
[00:36:55.563 --> 00:36:56.923]  That's what biometrics is.
[00:36:57.143 --> 00:36:58.184]  It is a fingerprint.
[00:36:58.224 --> 00:37:01.866]  But they say in the news, oh don't worry, we're not really taking your fingerprint.
[00:37:02.146 --> 00:37:03.166]  It's zeros and ones.
[00:37:03.206 --> 00:37:05.907]  Well of course something in a computer is zeros and ones.
[00:37:05.927 --> 00:37:06.948]  They recombine it
[00:37:07.348 --> 00:37:08.789]  And have the image of your thumbprint.
[00:37:08.809 --> 00:37:12.130]  So that's just a blatant lie that we hear everywhere.
[00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.710]  Please go ahead.
[00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:28.957]  Well, anyway, I have four sons, and just as a parent, I don't feel comfortable with my children's fingerprints or any part thereof ending up in some federal database somewhere.
[00:37:29.657 --> 00:37:35.159]  So that was, and anything that I think I don't want for my children, I think is an elected
[00:37:35.945 --> 00:37:41.007]  That it's my responsibility to not victimize other people's children in this way.
[00:37:41.027 --> 00:37:45.188]  So the feds mandated this for your school district?
[00:37:45.448 --> 00:37:45.749]  Pardon?
[00:37:46.269 --> 00:37:47.949]  So the federal government did mandate this?
[00:37:47.989 --> 00:37:58.353]  Well, they mandated it the way the feds mandate a lot of things, by saying you can have this money, however you can only spend this money in this way.
[00:37:58.373 --> 00:38:03.915]  So while they don't tell you exactly what, you're limited on what kind of scanner
[00:38:06.046 --> 00:38:11.148]  Mary, if I was on in Akron on the AM or FM dial, I wish you were.
[00:38:11.608 --> 00:38:12.428]  I could stop this.
[00:38:12.468 --> 00:38:19.612]  Well, the big conglomerates are buying everything up and buying any station we get on, but the point is, if we were able to warn people we could stop this.
[00:38:19.692 --> 00:38:25.854]  This is, ma'am, this is a 1968 Defense Department plan for the Cashless Society.
[00:38:25.874 --> 00:38:27.195]  You've probably heard in the news now they want to
[00:38:27.415 --> 00:38:27.775]  We're good to go.
[00:38:49.469 --> 00:38:50.650]  How about some lawsuits?
[00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.730]  How about some parents protesting?
[00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:54.411]  How about people just don't accept this?
[00:38:54.631 --> 00:38:55.972]  How about you lead that charge?
[00:38:55.992 --> 00:38:58.013]  Because this is such an important fight.
[00:38:58.873 --> 00:39:03.115]  Well, I think that that might very well happen.
[00:39:03.255 --> 00:39:16.240]  I think that there's a lot of things that, you know, big city school districts have a high number of kids from lower socioeconomic areas.
[00:39:16.833 --> 00:39:29.289]  And those children and those adults for years have been victimized by their training to be, for the government to be a paternal figure in their lives, to give them things.
[00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:30.211]  Oh, incredible.
[00:39:30.411 --> 00:39:30.912]  Absolutely.
[00:39:30.952 --> 00:39:32.434]  Sending them into the cattle chutes.
[00:39:32.694 --> 00:39:34.857]  And then they just make it sound like
[00:39:35.237 --> 00:39:37.918]  You know, they're taking care of them and they care about their well-being.
[00:39:37.978 --> 00:39:39.999]  Well, notice now it's for all the children.
[00:39:40.059 --> 00:39:43.841]  See, it was five years ago it was, oh, it's just for people on welfare.
[00:39:44.001 --> 00:39:57.267]  The reason that they're saying that it's for all the children is because once children get to be junior high and high school age, they don't like the stigma associated with having a lunch ticket and people knowing they're on free and reduced lunch.
[00:39:57.727 --> 00:40:03.350]  So, you know, it's amazing how people have allowed
[00:40:03.922 --> 00:40:07.030]  The government to control so much of their lives.
[00:40:07.151 --> 00:40:09.517]  I've seen parents drop kids off at school.
[00:40:09.537 --> 00:40:10.118]  Kindergarteners.
[00:40:10.179 --> 00:40:11.903]  We have citywide
[00:40:13.346 --> 00:40:14.527]  Free breakfast program?
[00:40:15.068 --> 00:40:17.350]  Late for school, past the time for it to be.
[00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:25.697]  And I've heard parents say to their kids, when it's past lunch, past breakfast time, you get up there and you tell those people they have to feed you.
[00:40:26.017 --> 00:40:27.758]  The school can't let you go hungry.
[00:40:27.778 --> 00:40:35.285]  Well, obviously, the family falling apart, people caring more about the football or baseball game than their kids, is helping the feds take over.
[00:40:36.045 --> 00:40:39.268]  This system of leaning on the government has made us dependent now.
[00:40:39.568 --> 00:40:43.809]  Well, it's just like their big lie about what's wrong with public education.
[00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:48.070]  You know, 91% of the students in this country go to public schools.
[00:40:49.390 --> 00:41:00.113]  Supposedly being in a crisis for the last 20 years and all the federal reforms and crap they've put in place, including the big lie about the testing, SAT scores have remained flat.
[00:41:00.754 --> 00:41:01.755]  Well, let me just say this.
[00:41:01.815 --> 00:41:03.316]  This is the problem with education.
[00:41:03.816 --> 00:41:13.544]  The feds take a dollar from the state or the county or the school district, send back 30 cents, if it's state administered, 71 cents a day on average.
[00:41:13.564 --> 00:41:15.305]  So this is not pre-federal money.
[00:41:15.845 --> 00:41:16.866]  This is a rip-off.
[00:41:17.126 --> 00:41:18.608]  We need to get the feds out of our lives.
[00:41:18.628 --> 00:41:20.249]  You need to talk to Charlotte Isserby.
[00:41:21.853 --> 00:41:28.697]  DeliberateDumbingDown.com, she was the deputy head, the head of policy at the Department of Education, 80 to 84.
[00:41:28.758 --> 00:41:37.703]  Did you know there's actually, and I'm not kidding when I say this, these CIA documents of how to break down the schools, how to make them fail, how to federalize them?
[00:41:38.143 --> 00:41:38.804]  They're doing it!
[00:41:39.484 --> 00:41:39.824]  Pardon me?
[00:41:40.024 --> 00:41:40.645]  They're doing it!
[00:41:41.357 --> 00:41:42.537]  Oh, they're doing it!
[00:41:42.637 --> 00:41:44.018]  It's happening!
[00:41:44.058 --> 00:41:49.599]  The federal government is, all this stuff with No Child Left Behind, you know, it's the big lie!
[00:41:49.819 --> 00:41:51.160]  And people believe this.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.441]  They believe that our schools are failing.
[00:41:53.461 --> 00:41:56.041]  You know, it's absolutely not true.
[00:41:56.261 --> 00:41:58.122]  Anybody that knows anything about curriculum
[00:41:58.642 --> 00:42:05.904]  And they're doing it by making people uncomfortable with having their children in school with people that don't look like and think like they do.
[00:42:05.924 --> 00:42:12.126]  Well, they say all this, so when there's a crisis, and there is in some schools, obviously, they can then bring in more federal control.
[00:42:12.266 --> 00:42:19.208]  But the problem, the reason that schools are in crisis are mostly because everybody wants there to be discipline for everybody except their kids.
[00:42:19.949 --> 00:42:24.450]  You know, I know that when I was in school, if I smarted off, they'd take me down and give me three pops.
[00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:28.003]  Uh, they'd make me run around the track till I threw up.
[00:42:28.344 --> 00:42:32.986]  But you can't do that anymore, so the kids, uh, instead are spoiled brats that come in with a gun and shoot people.
[00:42:33.046 --> 00:42:42.110]  Right, and then you have parents that, that, you know, they come in and they think their job is to be their kid's, uh, their kid's best friend, and they take the child's part in this.
[00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:47.653]  I mean, you know, parents are ruining their children because they're uncomfortable with being parents.
[00:42:48.907 --> 00:42:49.348]  I know this.
[00:42:49.528 --> 00:42:51.530]  I want schools where they pop you.
[00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:56.034]  I want schools where they run you around the track so you throw up if you're bad.
[00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:59.537]  And then we have better schools at that point.
[00:42:59.557 --> 00:43:00.358]  We've got to have discipline.
[00:43:00.398 --> 00:43:01.859]  You know, we didn't have better schools.
[00:43:01.959 --> 00:43:03.320]  Our schools weren't as good.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:15.551]  The other thing about schools is that now, it's federally mandated once again, which is going to destroy your test scores, every single handicapped child in the country
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.442]  Children have to go to the public school of their residence.
[00:43:19.822 --> 00:43:22.544]  Their district has to educate them.
[00:43:22.564 --> 00:43:30.108]  So children that used to go to schools for mentally retarded and physically handicapped, no longer do that.
[00:43:30.148 --> 00:43:31.128]  They're all Main Street.
[00:43:31.489 --> 00:43:42.615]  Children on respirators, children who will never contribute to society in any gainful way, are all... And those children, if their behavior is their handicap,
[00:43:43.166 --> 00:43:47.591]  They are also protected by handicap law and you can't discipline them.
[00:43:47.611 --> 00:43:49.474]  Alright, well let me stop you right there for a second.
[00:43:49.494 --> 00:43:51.036]  I want to get back into the biometrics.
[00:43:51.436 --> 00:43:52.077]  Okay.
[00:43:52.117 --> 00:43:54.720]  And not have a big discussion about education because that's huge.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.102]  You've got to talk to Charlotte Isserby though.
[00:43:56.122 --> 00:43:57.063]  This is a government plan.
[00:43:57.383 --> 00:43:58.364]  Okay, I would love to.
[00:43:58.384 --> 00:44:02.109]  We're talking to Mary Stormer and she's on the school board in Akron.
[00:44:03.004 --> 00:44:09.267]  Ohio, the story is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:44:10.607 --> 00:44:16.890]  So the feds are saying, take this money, put it in these thumb scanners, all the kids have got to do it, it goes into this federal and state database.
[00:44:18.615 --> 00:44:24.178]  I'm begging you and others to get the parents together to protest against this and get this removed.
[00:44:24.238 --> 00:44:27.200]  Is there any way to send the money back and call for another vote?
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.160]  Well, sure we will.
[00:44:28.321 --> 00:44:31.182]  We will have to send it back if we didn't spend it.
[00:44:31.462 --> 00:44:36.726]  What's interesting to me is... Don't the feds say like 95% of the kids will have the thumb scan?
[00:44:37.426 --> 00:44:39.807]  Or you won't get the money or something?
[00:44:40.188 --> 00:44:43.590]  Well, if we don't spend it, they'll take it back.
[00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.511]  But the other part of that is
[00:44:46.024 --> 00:44:56.120]  That I have gotten more emails and more phone calls on this than on anything that we voted on in the last three years.
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:00.827]  Have they told you to take a particular biometric company they want?
[00:45:01.624 --> 00:45:04.545]  Well, they always make a recommendation to the lowest and best bidder.
[00:45:04.605 --> 00:45:05.426]  Who do they recommend?
[00:45:05.906 --> 00:45:06.826]  Um, you know what?
[00:45:07.046 --> 00:45:10.328]  I can't remember, but they came and did a huge presentation for the board.
[00:45:10.448 --> 00:45:11.168]  Was it Vizionics?
[00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:12.689]  I didn't go to because... Vizionics?
[00:45:12.749 --> 00:45:13.489]  Choice Point?
[00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:15.230]  Biometric Access?
[00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.810]  You don't remember?
[00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:16.791]  You know what?
[00:45:16.851 --> 00:45:17.391]  I don't remember.
[00:45:17.491 --> 00:45:19.952]  I didn't go to the... North American Morpho Systems?
[00:45:20.132 --> 00:45:20.352]  No.
[00:45:21.033 --> 00:45:23.093]  It's Biometric something or other.
[00:45:23.814 --> 00:45:25.094]  Biometric Access, probably.
[00:45:25.394 --> 00:45:27.755]  Yes, that sounds familiar, but I wouldn't swear by it.
[00:45:27.775 --> 00:45:31.077]  Yeah, that's a military industrial complex company just north of Austin.
[00:45:32.089 --> 00:45:38.355]  That line about how they don't take your fingerprint, it's just zeros and ones, is what they like to spout on the news around here.
[00:45:38.375 --> 00:45:43.440]  And I've seen their president on TV spouting that, so that's the exact line I've heard.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:44.461]  Sounds like him.
[00:45:45.979 --> 00:45:47.740]  You know, it's very frightening.
[00:45:48.141 --> 00:45:50.322]  By the way, you know those things only cost them $25.
[00:45:50.363 --> 00:45:55.406]  The thumb scanners and the computers cost them about $60,000.
[00:45:55.927 --> 00:45:59.930]  And the digital line of the federal government costs another couple thousand.
[00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:04.874]  And then to administer it a few thousand a year sounds to me like you're getting scammed.
[00:46:04.894 --> 00:46:15.122]  Well, you know, them requiring that school districts report how many lunches that they sell every single day and report it on a daily basis,
[00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:26.036]  is one of the ways that they kind of force districts into buying things like this because the reporting is so burdensome.
[00:46:27.156 --> 00:46:28.577]  And it's just all part of the game.
[00:46:29.297 --> 00:46:29.578]  It is.
[00:46:29.678 --> 00:46:35.281]  And so they break down the family, break up the communities, and now 40-something percent, you saw the kids need the lunch.
[00:46:37.762 --> 00:46:38.863]  Sue won't have any jobs.
[00:46:38.883 --> 00:46:40.745]  We'll all be going to the government soup kitchen.
[00:46:40.765 --> 00:46:41.485]  That's all this is.
[00:46:41.505 --> 00:46:43.026]  Training your kids how to go to the soup kitchen.
[00:46:43.046 --> 00:46:44.468]  Training them how to live on a plantation.
[00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:48.111]  Do your schools have fences and ID cards and armed guards?
[00:46:48.791 --> 00:46:49.051]  No.
[00:46:49.852 --> 00:46:52.674]  A lot of them do around here, and they're training them how to be little prisoners.
[00:46:53.335 --> 00:46:54.816]  So where does this go, Mary Stormer?
[00:46:54.856 --> 00:46:56.898]  I mean, you say you've got more emails, more calls.
[00:46:57.258 --> 00:46:58.219]  The community's outraged.
[00:46:58.259 --> 00:47:06.306]  I hope these thousands of parents... You know, it's interesting to me that the community's outraged, and another person who was on the board that's
[00:47:07.236 --> 00:47:13.042]  You know, a Republican and a moderate to conservative like myself voted for it.
[00:47:13.603 --> 00:47:16.847]  And I was just stunned that she did.
[00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.789]  Sounds like a neo-con to me.
[00:47:18.889 --> 00:47:20.631]  But the people that love it the most
[00:47:21.189 --> 00:47:25.810]  Are the people who have grown up with a pattern of the government taking care of them.
[00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:26.450]  Oh, yeah.
[00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:28.731]  And there was absolutely strong argument.
[00:47:28.751 --> 00:47:30.271]  Well, I want to tell you who runs this.
[00:47:30.712 --> 00:47:31.892]  Give you some ammunition, Mary.
[00:47:32.112 --> 00:47:32.432]  Okay.
[00:47:32.552 --> 00:47:39.514]  A convicted five-time felon runs this from DARPA and the National Security Agency, Admiral Coindexter.
[00:47:40.854 --> 00:47:41.254]  Really?
[00:47:41.634 --> 00:47:41.935]  Yes.
[00:47:42.655 --> 00:47:43.435]  Okay, that's frightening.
[00:47:45.061 --> 00:47:45.702]  Yes, it is.
[00:47:45.923 --> 00:47:47.024]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[00:47:47.044 --> 00:47:48.165]  We really appreciate you coming on.
[00:47:48.386 --> 00:47:52.331]  No, I'm grateful for the opportunity and I'm grateful for the work that you do.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.161]  So thank you for that.
[00:47:54.621 --> 00:47:57.502]  And someday, maybe they'll let you get on a station in Ohio.
[00:47:57.783 --> 00:47:58.683]  Well, call them and tell them.
[00:47:58.703 --> 00:48:00.564]  We're on Star Guide, the best satellite available.
[00:48:00.965 --> 00:48:01.325]  Okay.
[00:48:01.505 --> 00:48:05.027]  Do you have a website for the school board so people can email and call them?
[00:48:05.347 --> 00:48:06.668]  Well, we do.
[00:48:07.508 --> 00:48:12.531]  That's Akron Schools, A-K-R-O-N Schools dot com is our website.
[00:48:12.811 --> 00:48:14.372]  Akron Schools dot com.
[00:48:14.532 --> 00:48:14.793]  Yes.
[00:48:15.293 --> 00:48:20.656]  And my email address is M-A-S
[00:48:21.189 --> 00:48:24.471]  The number for kids at AOL.com.
[00:48:24.831 --> 00:48:25.212]  All right.
[00:48:25.232 --> 00:48:26.652]  I hope people send you information.
[00:48:26.692 --> 00:48:27.273]  God bless you.
[00:48:27.313 --> 00:48:27.953]  Godspeed.
[00:48:28.273 --> 00:48:29.574]  Stop this evil takeover.

[00:49:31.986 --> 00:49:36.469]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:49:36.809 --> 00:49:40.912]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:41.212 --> 00:49:41.752]  We listened.
[00:49:42.072 --> 00:49:47.055]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:47.316 --> 00:49:47.796]  We listened.
[00:49:48.196 --> 00:49:51.238]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:51.658 --> 00:49:52.199]  We listened.
[00:49:52.659 --> 00:49:55.801]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:49:56.021 --> 00:49:56.341]  I think so.
[00:50:22.913 --> 00:50:25.215]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:50:34.677 --> 00:50:35.977]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:50:36.178 --> 00:50:41.919]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:50:42.179 --> 00:50:47.441]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:50:47.741 --> 00:50:51.882]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:50:52.062 --> 00:50:55.844]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:50:56.104 --> 00:51:00.685]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:00.805 --> 00:51:07.069]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:07.129 --> 00:51:08.990]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.261]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:51:40.277 --> 00:51:42.039]  Alright folks, we're back live.
[00:51:42.159 --> 00:51:42.920]  We will take calls.
[00:51:43.121 --> 00:51:44.943]  I just had that guest on.
[00:51:57.569 --> 00:52:05.018]  The total free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:52:05.038 --> 00:52:06.320]  800-259-9231.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.401]  We have another guest coming on.
[00:52:07.781 --> 00:52:11.726]  High level in the war crimes trial of General Tommy Franks from Belgium.
[00:52:12.487 --> 00:52:13.588]  Coming on to discuss that.
[00:52:13.668 --> 00:52:15.571]  But, you know, this article
[00:52:16.983 --> 00:52:22.724]  Gets into how they're getting rid of all the cash registers, and many school districts are doing this, and cash is all we're getting rid of it.
[00:52:23.184 --> 00:52:27.705]  And I told you it was federal, because I have the plans, and I told you they're pressuring them to do it, and I told you it goes into a database.
[00:52:28.525 --> 00:52:29.966]  For buying and selling, folks!
[00:52:30.566 --> 00:52:36.427]  And here was the school board, she's actually the president, Mary Stormer, telling you this.
[00:52:37.607 --> 00:52:41.608]  And she's a conservative, and she's mad about the other conservatives who aren't real conservatives.
[00:52:41.928 --> 00:52:45.149]  Aren't we all who have some gray matter between our ears?
[00:52:46.613 --> 00:52:53.401]  So I hope you visit the Akron School website and get involved and educate these folks because this fight is everywhere.
[00:52:54.983 --> 00:53:01.548]  That's why it's so special and so important that we're on in Austin, Texas and Pensacola, Florida and Rochester, New York and Washington, D.C.
[00:53:01.588 --> 00:53:02.669]  and Denver, Colorado.
[00:53:03.149 --> 00:53:10.595]  That's why it's important you pick up the fight and start organizations and get involved and say no to this before they put it in in your area.
[00:53:10.655 --> 00:53:12.136]  We have got to make a stand.
[00:53:12.616 --> 00:53:17.380]  Because once the biometrics go in everywhere, we're only a few years away from this, you won't have a choice.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.061]  They'll have you captured.
[00:53:20.162 --> 00:53:21.983]  It is so important.
[00:53:22.043 --> 00:53:24.225]  Halliburton settles 20 class action suits.
[00:53:25.126 --> 00:53:26.326]  We'll get into that.
[00:53:28.247 --> 00:53:28.687]  Wow.
[00:53:28.727 --> 00:53:29.527]  We'll get into that.
[00:53:29.728 --> 00:53:35.449]  We'll also talk about some other interesting articles here about POW torture photos.
[00:53:35.669 --> 00:53:40.451]  What our loving government is doing to people in Iraq at the giant extermination and re-education centers.
[00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:41.851]  That Reuters story from Monday.
[00:53:41.871 --> 00:53:42.772]  The U.S.
[00:53:42.812 --> 00:53:43.792]  announces death camps.
[00:53:43.832 --> 00:53:44.672]  I want to get back into that.
[00:53:44.692 --> 00:53:46.353]  That story's so big I ought to cover it again.
[00:53:47.593 --> 00:53:49.614]  It's all coming up on the show.
[00:53:51.191 --> 00:53:58.316]  On this 30th of May 2003 and coming up your your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:53:58.336 --> 00:54:11.205]  Before I go to your calls I do want to remind the listeners that I have produced nine full-length feature professionally produced documentary films where I lay out their master plan.
[00:54:11.525 --> 00:54:13.306]  The Globalist Master Plan and how to stop them.
[00:54:13.766 --> 00:54:17.509]  The newest film is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.770]  It is
[00:54:19.947 --> 00:54:20.608]  Oh, it's long.
[00:54:20.668 --> 00:54:22.350]  It's 2 hours and 37 minutes.
[00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:25.314]  I suggest you watch it in three 50-plus minute segments.
[00:54:26.275 --> 00:54:35.246]  I suggest you make hundreds of copies of it and get it out to friends and family and opinion makers so people that have an idea of what's happening have the full agenda.
[00:54:35.947 --> 00:54:38.611]  Imagine what a Mary Stormer would do if she had my films.
[00:54:39.415 --> 00:54:43.497]  Imagine, there's a lot of people that know something's wrong, they just don't have the big picture.
[00:54:43.737 --> 00:54:45.058]  They're not outside the box.
[00:54:45.178 --> 00:54:45.718]  We are.
[00:54:46.138 --> 00:54:51.681]  Help spread the truth, a renaissance of information, an awakening, a revelation of understanding.
[00:54:52.861 --> 00:54:56.223]  If you get three or more of any of my nine videos, they drop down to 20 bucks from $25.95.
[00:54:56.363 --> 00:54:57.364]  My book is 230 pages.
[00:54:57.384 --> 00:54:58.684]  9-1-1, dissent and deterrent.
[00:54:58.724 --> 00:55:00.425]  It covers 9-1-1 and more.
[00:55:00.525 --> 00:55:00.905]  It's only $12.
[00:55:05.385 --> 00:55:12.372]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order the films of the book or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:13.393]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:55:22.776 --> 00:55:39.130]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9 or infowars.com or net or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:55:41.251 --> 00:55:42.853]  Get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:42.913 --> 00:55:44.954]  I watched part of that movie again last night.
[00:55:45.014 --> 00:55:46.035]  It is my best film.
[00:55:46.956 --> 00:55:47.957]  Two hours and 24 minutes.
[00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:48.657]  170 minutes on DVD, even longer.
[00:55:52.012 --> 00:55:53.073]  Get the videos.
[00:55:53.273 --> 00:55:54.194]  Make the copies.
[00:55:54.294 --> 00:55:55.214]  Get them out to people.
[00:55:55.274 --> 00:55:57.116]  Masters of Terror, Part 2 of Registering.
[00:55:57.296 --> 00:55:59.257]  My new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:55:59.357 --> 00:56:03.781]  Get them.
[00:56:04.161 --> 00:56:05.422]  Don't wait.
[00:56:05.442 --> 00:56:05.502]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:06.142 --> 00:56:07.103]  We've got the numbers.
[00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:08.144]  We're the majority.
[00:56:08.444 --> 00:56:10.806]  But Peter Jennings isn't going to tell you that or unify you.
[00:56:11.126 --> 00:56:12.427]  You've got to do it at the grassroots.
[00:56:12.907 --> 00:56:15.529]  Your calls and a guest and a ton of news we haven't hit.
[00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:17.531]  Coming up in the second and third hours.
[00:56:17.691 --> 00:56:19.092]  Please stay with us.
[00:56:21.716 --> 00:56:24.338]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:56:24.578 --> 00:56:30.321]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:56:30.561 --> 00:56:31.922]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:56:32.022 --> 00:56:35.644]  In fact, this is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.219 --> 00:56:47.860]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:49.581]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.281 --> 00:56:51.422]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.043 --> 00:56:52.863]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.624 --> 00:56:54.524]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.185 --> 00:56:59.108]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.368 --> 00:57:03.491]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:04.552 --> 00:57:06.473]  Welcome back.
[00:57:06.593 --> 00:57:07.734]  Already into the second hour.
[00:57:08.274 --> 00:57:11.236]  About to go to Mike, Regina, Linda, and others who are patiently holding.
[00:57:11.256 --> 00:57:12.377]  We got Frank Goral.
[00:57:13.638 --> 00:57:16.120]  New documentary, The War Against the Third World, coming on.
[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:26.085]  Because it integrates with that story that Joyce reminded me of, of the admitted plan to sterilize half the women in 13 countries.
[00:57:26.145 --> 00:57:29.587]  It was carried out in 74 successfully through 1988.
[00:57:29.647 --> 00:57:32.448]  It's still going on right now.
[00:57:33.389 --> 00:57:37.091]  And then I have the War Crimes Tribunal guy coming on the show in the third hour.
[00:57:37.151 --> 00:57:38.752]  Right now, let's go to Mike in Illinois.
[00:57:38.812 --> 00:57:39.672]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:57:39.692 --> 00:57:40.153]  Go ahead.
[00:57:40.173 --> 00:57:41.193]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[00:57:41.353 --> 00:57:41.894]  Fantastic.
[00:57:41.914 --> 00:57:42.494]  What'd you think of that?
[00:57:43.163 --> 00:57:47.465]  That city, that school board lady talking about the federal takeover with the thumb scanners.
[00:57:47.625 --> 00:57:49.386]  Alex, I'll tell you what, I'm not surprised.
[00:57:49.526 --> 00:57:51.407]  I was actually going to call you on this.
[00:57:51.927 --> 00:57:53.968]  My daughter goes to a private school, thank God.
[00:57:54.488 --> 00:58:01.031]  But last week, I still get all my mail from the district, the school district, you know, in the homes in the area, I still get all the district mail.
[00:58:01.764 --> 00:58:03.905]  And it was for the lunch program starting next year.
[00:58:03.925 --> 00:58:08.347]  They're going to have an ID that the child, it's not the school ID, it's a separate ID for lunch.
[00:58:08.507 --> 00:58:09.808]  And there's got barcode in there.
[00:58:09.968 --> 00:58:11.649]  You've got to swipe it and it goes to the phone.
[00:58:11.749 --> 00:58:12.950]  You've got to swipe it.
[00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:14.430]  A lot of colleges already do that.
[00:58:14.711 --> 00:58:15.151]  Absolutely.
[00:58:15.211 --> 00:58:17.272]  And now it's all in the grade schools, Alex.
[00:58:17.492 --> 00:58:18.713]  Grades pre-K through 8.
[00:58:19.613 --> 00:58:21.354]  Training them for the cashless society.
[00:58:21.554 --> 00:58:23.695]  It's just as bad as biometrics.
[00:58:23.855 --> 00:58:24.536]  It is, Alex.
[00:58:24.576 --> 00:58:26.997]  And we're on our way to a cashless society very rapidly.
[00:58:27.017 --> 00:58:28.958]  And in fact, what I wanted to ask you, Alex, is
[00:58:29.659 --> 00:58:36.084]  I listen to a Christian station in the evening here locally in the Chicago area and I forgot the gentleman's name.
[00:58:36.124 --> 00:58:38.245]  I had it written down at home and I left for work this morning.
[00:58:38.285 --> 00:58:40.326]  I forgot it, but I know the name of his video.
[00:58:40.707 --> 00:58:41.827]  It's called Monopoly Men.
[00:58:41.868 --> 00:58:42.548]  Have you ever heard of it?
[00:58:43.248 --> 00:58:43.509]  Yes.
[00:58:44.009 --> 00:58:44.669]  What do you think of it?
[00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:45.810]  It's pretty good.
[00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:46.371]  Pretty good.
[00:58:47.191 --> 00:58:49.593]  Basically, he was a guest and he was saying
[00:58:50.205 --> 00:58:58.349]  That, you know, we're probably five years or possibly less away from cashless society, where cash will be, you know, deleted completely.
[00:58:58.369 --> 00:59:01.190]  Sure, they're already pulling out the checkout lines doing self-serve.
[00:59:01.310 --> 00:59:02.590]  Self-serve everywhere, Alex.
[00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:03.511]  In grocery stores.
[00:59:03.631 --> 00:59:04.991]  Then they put the thumb scanners in.
[00:59:05.031 --> 00:59:05.792]  That's now happening.
[00:59:05.812 --> 00:59:08.993]  Then they pull out the rest of the lanes, and you've got to do it or no food.
[00:59:09.273 --> 00:59:09.453]  Right.
[00:59:09.713 --> 00:59:12.294]  And basically, Alex, you're familiar with Home Depot.
[00:59:12.314 --> 00:59:13.335]  Do you have those down in Texas?
[00:59:14.032 --> 00:59:17.733]  Yeah, they're pulling out the lanes, putting in self-serve, now the biometrics are about to go in.
[00:59:18.053 --> 00:59:18.513]  Absolutely.
[00:59:18.713 --> 00:59:21.713]  HEB put in the self-serves, now they're putting the thumb scanners in.
[00:59:21.833 --> 00:59:22.373]  Already happened.
[00:59:22.974 --> 00:59:23.554]  Unbelievable.
[00:59:24.274 --> 00:59:26.054]  Alex, that's all I wanted to tell you.
[00:59:26.234 --> 00:59:34.956]  Basically, I'm about to order the 9-11 Road to Tyranny film, and I'm going to show it to a bunch of people at my local church in a couple of weeks when I get it.
[00:59:34.996 --> 00:59:37.256]  That's the first film everybody should get.
[00:59:37.396 --> 00:59:38.016]  It's the best.
[00:59:38.056 --> 00:59:38.776]  Thanks for the call.
[00:59:38.796 --> 00:59:39.136]  Thanks, Al.
[00:59:39.536 --> 00:59:39.897]  You bet.
[00:59:39.917 --> 00:59:41.497]  Let's talk to Regina in Pennsylvania.
[00:59:41.537 --> 00:59:42.377]  Regina, go ahead.
[00:59:43.948 --> 00:59:59.838]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to say, I can't quite understand, that lady was great, but she seemed to think that lady that was a Republican, you know, I think a lot of this is the consolidation kind of thing, where they think they're going to save money by keeping track of everybody.
[01:00:00.358 --> 01:00:05.061]  Well of course the people going along with the Feds don't know, they're useful idiots, but this lady's waking up.
[01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:10.645]  But I'm talking about whoever is running with her that she said was like a conservative moderate, but voted for it.
[01:00:11.215 --> 01:00:17.159]  I think some of these people seem to think that, you know, this is causing us too much money and this is the way we can control everything.
[01:00:17.199 --> 01:00:18.080]  That's how it's sold to them.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:18.760]  Pardon me?
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.501]  That's how it's sold to them.
[01:00:20.521 --> 01:00:21.042]  That's what I mean.
[01:00:21.082 --> 01:00:24.184]  And what I wanted to bring up was, and I want to thank Joan from Florida.
[01:00:24.804 --> 01:00:28.286]  She got in on C-SPAN on Greg Pallas today, and what an answer to prayer.
[01:00:28.947 --> 01:00:34.270]  And I don't want to be critical of him, but he was questioned on the W199I.
[01:00:34.411 --> 01:00:37.413]  I believe that's what it was referred to.
[01:00:37.473 --> 01:00:39.174]  But he didn't actually give the document.
[01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:41.318]  I don't know why
[01:01:03.479 --> 01:01:04.820]  Regina, I'm trying to understand something here.
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.241]  You say Joan from Florida called in.
[01:01:07.661 --> 01:01:11.002]  She called in and plugged W1999, okay?
[01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:24.927]  He brought it up earlier, but he brought up McKinney and the fact that she brought up a document and then she immediately was misrepresented as being blaming Bush for 9-1-1.
[01:01:26.636 --> 01:01:29.618]  I just couldn't understand, you know, what he was really doing there.
[01:01:29.818 --> 01:01:33.581]  But one of the things that, and I was thankful, she actually... You're gonna have to hold.
[01:01:33.641 --> 01:01:39.484]  You're gonna... We got a guest coming up, but Regina and Lynn and others, just hold, because the guest isn't gonna be on long, and we'll get to you during the guest.
[01:01:39.505 --> 01:01:39.825]  Stay there.
[01:01:40.165 --> 01:01:40.745]  Be right back.
[01:01:43.427 --> 01:01:46.549]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:01:46.809 --> 01:01:50.252]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio is the answer.

[01:02:26.851 --> 01:02:27.112]  Call today.
[01:02:42.774 --> 01:02:50.161]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:50.441 --> 01:02:55.185]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.386 --> 01:03:01.051]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.271 --> 01:03:05.793]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:03:06.033 --> 01:03:13.176]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:03:13.196 --> 01:03:13.997]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:03:14.037 --> 01:03:17.739]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:03:17.899 --> 01:03:20.420]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:27.343]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:03:27.583 --> 01:03:32.847]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[01:04:02.177 --> 01:04:06.498]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.

[01:04:36.821 --> 01:04:49.907]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:50.527 --> 01:04:53.568]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:55.249 --> 01:04:59.830]  The Republicans can see the corruption of the Democrats, but can't see their own corruption.
[01:05:00.351 --> 01:05:03.492]  The Democrats can see the corruption of the Republicans, but can't see their own corruption.
[01:05:04.491 --> 01:05:08.272]  But it's all run by the same people, the globalists, the people that Eisenhower warned us about.
[01:05:09.172 --> 01:05:11.173]  America's being turned into a total police state.
[01:05:11.193 --> 01:05:20.095]  We're going to take one call and we're going to go to our guest, Frank Doral, who's made a new powerful documentary film, The War Against the Third World.
[01:05:20.175 --> 01:05:22.776]  But right now, let's real quick go to Linda.
[01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:25.696]  And Linda, where are you calling us from today?
[01:05:25.996 --> 01:05:26.836]  Kent City area.
[01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:28.057]  Welcome, you're on the air.
[01:05:28.637 --> 01:05:29.497]  Okay, thank you.
[01:05:29.537 --> 01:05:32.678]  I want to point out something that has to go along with the school.
[01:05:33.459 --> 01:05:34.120]  Yes.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.581]  Can't say star today.
[01:05:36.882 --> 01:05:37.723]  Page A3.
[01:05:38.323 --> 01:05:40.645]  The U.S.
[01:05:40.826 --> 01:05:44.889]  aims to put irradiated meat on the students' menus next year.
[01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:57.460]  And there's discussions of not letting you bring back lunches because parents don't know what to send that's healthy while they put vending machines full of Snickers and Coca-Cola and the kids are all getting fat and hyped out on sugar bouncing off the walls.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:59.402]  Then they put them on Ritalin and Prozac.
[01:06:00.254 --> 01:06:05.123]  And, uh, yeah, this was the plan, and now making you thumb scan to get your food, training them for that.
[01:06:05.744 --> 01:06:14.098]  We had the school board president on last hour from Akron, Ohio, talking about that nightmare, so... Yeah, this is an Associated Press article.
[01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:19.780]  And it has to do with the poison into the food supply that goes along with everything else going on.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.861]  Well, for those that don't know, it's dead meat.
[01:06:21.981 --> 01:06:27.964]  Literally, meat is still alive if it's fresh, but it breaks all the ring structures, all the key enzymes needed.
[01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.486]  So they're going to feed our children, as usual.
[01:06:30.526 --> 01:06:34.247]  I've seen some of our articles, the trash of the trash of corporate America.
[01:06:35.268 --> 01:06:37.269]  Well, it's totally non-nutritional.
[01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:41.000]  And what the long-term health problems are, I can't say.
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:43.441]  It's already been linked to bowel blockages and everything.
[01:06:43.481 --> 01:06:48.884]  I don't want to mention it, but irradiated meat does not break down in the digestive tract.
[01:06:49.184 --> 01:06:54.727]  The naturally occurring bacteria that are in the meat and your stomach have trouble getting together and breaking it down.
[01:06:54.828 --> 01:06:55.528]  It's horrible.
[01:06:56.542 --> 01:07:00.205]  It sounds like it's a very bad news for our total food supply.
[01:07:00.465 --> 01:07:03.968]  And then they're going to destroy our water as quick as they can, I'm sure.
[01:07:04.489 --> 01:07:06.050]  Oh yeah, I appreciate the call.
[01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:06.791]  Anything else, Linda?
[01:07:06.991 --> 01:07:19.501]  That's about it right now, except for what I heard on Jerry Brownfield this morning, that there's a House Bill and a Senate Bill, I don't have the numbers, a Native Species Act.
[01:07:20.971 --> 01:07:26.414]  Invasive and harmful species and of course cattle are part of that.
[01:07:26.434 --> 01:07:28.895]  Dogs and cats and all kinds of fish.
[01:07:29.335 --> 01:07:30.356]  Nothing to do with the environment.
[01:07:30.456 --> 01:07:31.477]  All about land grabbing.
[01:07:32.037 --> 01:07:33.478]  I've been to smart growth conferences.
[01:07:33.538 --> 01:07:34.898]  It's all bankers up there.
[01:07:35.699 --> 01:07:46.404]  Mainly Republicans rubbing their hands together with mindless Democrats following them and useful idiots believing they're helping the environment as they genetically engineer everything and truly destroy the biosphere.
[01:07:46.765 --> 01:07:47.505]  Absolutely.
[01:07:48.436 --> 01:07:48.916]  You've got it.
[01:07:49.236 --> 01:07:50.297]  All right, thanks for the call.
[01:07:50.397 --> 01:07:53.518]  And if we don't break this phony left-right paradigm, it's over, folks.
[01:07:53.618 --> 01:07:54.658]  It's totally over.
[01:07:54.698 --> 01:07:56.259]  Bill Clinton and George Bush working together.
[01:07:57.099 --> 01:07:58.900]  Joining us now is Frank Doral.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.302]  What you didn't learn in school and don't hear on the mainstream media, the war against the third world.
[01:08:04.842 --> 01:08:10.264]  That's a screening at Fairfax Saturday and Sunday, June 14th, 15th.
[01:08:10.364 --> 01:08:10.984]  I hear it's great.
[01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:11.645]  I haven't seen it.
[01:08:12.945 --> 01:08:14.506]  I've seen some of the pieces that are in it, though.
[01:08:14.526 --> 01:08:15.266]  The documentary is
[01:08:16.588 --> 01:08:23.738]  A provocative compilation of incendiary exposé showing a shocking portrait of globalist foreign policy, they say U.S.
[01:08:24.139 --> 01:08:29.066]  interventions and CIA covert operations revealing a corrupt history of power in politics.
[01:08:30.015 --> 01:08:32.998]  And it gets into what they cover, the war against the third world.
[01:08:33.018 --> 01:08:38.703]  This documentary on earth remains of more than a half a century of secret wars, assassinations and genocide by U.S.
[01:08:38.723 --> 01:08:52.937]  military intelligence, alphabet soup agencies, chemical, biological, psychological, economic warfare, and how the refined science of advertising, PR, or propaganda are used to carpet bomb historical records, ergo the intelligence classic to cover up.
[01:08:53.863 --> 01:09:01.313]  And Mr. Dorrell has compiled a two-hour shocker, a clear-eyed vision of what the terms of CIA covert operations and the U.S.
[01:09:01.453 --> 01:09:03.115]  intervention since World War II.
[01:09:03.155 --> 01:09:08.102]  It opens with the short but extremely powerful clip of Dr. Martin Luther King addressing a crowd.
[01:09:08.182 --> 01:09:09.684]  Alright folks, now understand something here.
[01:09:12.891 --> 01:09:16.353]  I brought this back because I heard Joyce mentioning it and I'd totally forgotten about it.
[01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:25.197]  The confirmed 30 page CIA NSA slash National Security Council document, I have it on Infowars.com, top story from yesterday.
[01:09:26.057 --> 01:09:35.621]  The official document where they said they want to exterminate by forcible sterilization the wombs of half of 13 third world most populous nations.
[01:09:35.801 --> 01:09:36.902]  And they're doing this!
[01:09:38.024 --> 01:09:39.485]  I mean, this is Nazi, folks.
[01:09:39.665 --> 01:09:40.685]  Joining us is Frank Doral.
[01:09:41.286 --> 01:09:43.087]  Frank, thank you for coming on the show today, sir.
[01:09:43.607 --> 01:09:44.847]  Alex, thanks for having me, very much.
[01:09:45.208 --> 01:09:46.288]  You bet.
[01:09:47.389 --> 01:09:51.771]  Reading about your film here, it sounds very exciting and accurate.
[01:09:52.751 --> 01:10:02.896]  Of course, the CIA ships in the drugs, uses it to control the third world, sets up guerrilla forces on both sides to destabilize, pays off governments to take IMF and World Bank loans and not pay them back.
[01:10:04.017 --> 01:10:04.897]  What are we facing?
[01:10:04.957 --> 01:10:05.858]  What is your film about?
[01:10:06.764 --> 01:10:08.725]  Well, about all what you just talked about.
[01:10:10.045 --> 01:10:13.427]  What it is, it's two hours long, and it's a compilation I put together.
[01:10:13.887 --> 01:10:17.328]  Some of the best truth-tellers to ever speak out in this country about U.S.
[01:10:17.348 --> 01:10:24.972]  foreign policy and these issues, and some of the best documentaries ever made, I've edited it all down into this two-hour compilation called, What I've Learned About U.S.
[01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:26.612]  Foreign Policy, The War Against the Third World.
[01:10:27.633 --> 01:10:30.514]  And I've been distributing it for the last couple years.
[01:10:30.734 --> 01:10:35.096]  Since 9-11, a lot of copies have gone out all over the country, and a lot of people are watching it.
[01:10:36.096 --> 01:10:40.838]  The people on the video are very believable, they're credible, they're known people, they've been there.
[01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:52.124]  People such as Martin Luther King, XCA, John Stockwell, Bill Moyers, Ramsey Clark, Amy Goodman, and many others, Father Roy Bourgeois, who are speaking out.
[01:10:52.444 --> 01:10:54.084]  Now let me stop and then I'll let you talk.
[01:10:54.124 --> 01:10:55.085]  Here's the problem.
[01:10:56.425 --> 01:10:57.166]  I know Clark.
[01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.689]  I rebuilt the Branch Davidian Church.
[01:10:59.709 --> 01:11:03.273]  I'm not a Davidian, but I built a memorial church that seats 400 with the help of listeners.
[01:11:03.453 --> 01:11:04.074]  I know Clark.
[01:11:04.174 --> 01:11:07.057]  I've spoke with him there about five times.
[01:11:09.319 --> 01:11:14.385]  Clark's got a lot of good points, but then he thinks that the liberal agenda is going to save us, and it's not.
[01:11:15.728 --> 01:11:16.629]  And you mentioned Moyers.
[01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:19.892]  He'll expose the Patriot Act, but he's a member of the CFR.
[01:11:20.272 --> 01:11:21.973]  It's kind of controlling the paradigm.
[01:11:22.454 --> 01:11:28.278]  And I still understand what you're saying, but does your film expose that this stuff goes on in Democrat administrations as well?
[01:11:28.858 --> 01:11:31.100]  Oh, definitely.
[01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:35.604]  The Democrats have been in power just as much during all these wars as the Republicans.
[01:11:36.644 --> 01:11:38.566]  Because if we don't point that out, we don't go anywhere.
[01:11:40.227 --> 01:11:40.848]  Believe me, we're not...
[01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:43.516]  I am not a Democrat.
[01:11:43.736 --> 01:11:44.217]  I used to be.
[01:11:44.237 --> 01:11:45.537]  I used to be some years ago.
[01:11:45.877 --> 01:11:47.237]  It's like I used to be a Republican.
[01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:48.898]  You learn, you live.
[01:11:49.118 --> 01:11:54.719]  Well, Randy Marks says it on the tape and Noam Chomsky says the same thing that we don't... There aren't two parties.
[01:11:54.739 --> 01:11:57.400]  There's only one party, the business party, the military business party.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.560]  But I wouldn't even see... You know, you say USAID did all this.
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.781]  Or you say the business party, Corporate America.
[01:12:02.821 --> 01:12:03.941]  It isn't Corporate America.
[01:12:04.361 --> 01:12:07.922]  It's organized crime, Jolly Roger, piracy.
[01:12:08.262 --> 01:12:10.343]  They operate as crime syndicates.
[01:12:10.383 --> 01:12:11.683]  They don't operate as businesses.
[01:12:14.062 --> 01:12:14.903]  You understand what I'm saying?
[01:12:14.943 --> 01:12:18.227]  Well, yeah, I mean, I think we're saying the same thing with different terminology.
[01:12:18.927 --> 01:12:24.994]  I know, but then all I see is the low-level left galvanizes a battering ram against the middle class.
[01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:26.916]  You know, take the environmentalists.
[01:12:26.936 --> 01:12:29.319]  They're busy out grabbing farms and ranches.
[01:12:30.296 --> 01:12:38.440]  And they're funded by the big corporations that are getting the land after this happens, but then nothing's happening with Texas company Prote-Gene putting AIDS virus in corn supplies.
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:39.181]  Did you know about that?
[01:12:40.001 --> 01:12:40.982]  It's Associated Press.
[01:12:41.022 --> 01:12:43.603]  Well yeah, it was a pharmacological corn test.
[01:12:43.903 --> 01:12:45.444]  Why isn't the left worried about that?
[01:12:49.102 --> 01:12:50.323]  I can't speak for everybody, Alex.
[01:12:50.683 --> 01:12:52.324]  Well, I apologize for getting on the beaten track.
[01:12:52.364 --> 01:12:53.265]  It's okay.
[01:12:53.565 --> 01:12:56.146]  This left-right paradigm is really what I'm focusing on.
[01:12:56.186 --> 01:13:00.769]  What I'm trying to do, and I work with Veterans for Peace, and I work with many of these groups.
[01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:04.751]  What I'm trying to do, and also I published a book, Addicted to War, Why the U.S.
[01:13:04.791 --> 01:13:08.734]  Can't Take No Prison, by Joe Andreas, which is pretty popular out there right now.
[01:13:08.914 --> 01:13:09.954]  Yes, it's a great book.
[01:13:10.195 --> 01:13:10.575]  Thank you.
[01:13:12.636 --> 01:13:17.599]  The book and the video, what I'm just trying to do is wake up your average American citizen who doesn't really understand any of this.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:33.025]  Who bought the propaganda, the disinformation, the misinformation, the mass hypnosis that goes on in this country, and trying to wake them up out of that so we can get more people to start standing up and trying to stop all this.
[01:13:33.045 --> 01:13:33.685]  Well, you said it.
[01:13:33.845 --> 01:13:35.346]  It is mass hypnosis.
[01:13:35.486 --> 01:13:39.047]  It's PR or pitch men advertising folks.
[01:13:39.127 --> 01:13:43.369]  It is the greatest science of propaganda because they've had so long to perfect it.
[01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:48.110]  And as Michael Perrini says, they learn from their mistakes.
[01:13:48.191 --> 01:13:51.033]  They do learn from their mistakes.
[01:13:51.053 --> 01:13:52.834]  They know what they're doing.
[01:13:53.915 --> 01:13:54.896]  They're like the board.
[01:13:56.958 --> 01:13:58.659]  They just keep assimilating.
[01:14:01.301 --> 01:14:02.742]  Tell us about your film when it gets into.
[01:14:03.823 --> 01:14:05.345]  Well, like I said, it's the 10th segment.
[01:14:05.425 --> 01:14:08.127]  It starts out with Martin Luther King speaking out against the war in Vietnam.
[01:14:09.268 --> 01:14:14.192]  He's the one person on this tape who we feel was assassinated for what he was doing.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:16.760]  He was a threat.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.961]  He had a big audience.
[01:14:18.001 --> 01:14:18.961]  Millions of people listened to him.
[01:14:19.161 --> 01:14:20.961]  Well, it's a fact that he was assassinated.
[01:14:21.321 --> 01:14:21.561]  Right.
[01:14:22.641 --> 01:14:27.562]  And ex-CIA John Stockwell talking about the history of the CIA.
[01:14:27.662 --> 01:14:29.883]  He's the highest level CIA officer ever to testify to Congress.
[01:14:30.483 --> 01:14:35.283]  He worked for George Bush, who was a director of the CIA at the time, in 1975.
[01:14:36.424 --> 01:14:43.585]  And then there is Bill Moore's documentary, The Secret Government, which covers the Cold War and the history of the CIA up until 1987 when he made that.
[01:14:44.915 --> 01:14:48.578]  By the way, that thing has been disappeared.
[01:14:48.638 --> 01:14:49.598]  He can't find it anywhere.
[01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:52.380]  We just happened to record it off a TV.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:15:06.770]  And there's a cover-up where he has Ron Contrafair, which is made by the Empowerment Project, narrated by Elizabeth Montgomery, and talks about what we did in Nicaragua, and the arming Iran, and the connection there.
[01:15:07.471 --> 01:15:12.374]  And it deals a lot with the CIA cocaine connection.
[01:15:13.972 --> 01:15:30.065]  The School of Assassins is about the School of Americas, Fort Benning, Georgia, and everybody's students to Randon, where we have, they say there's a war on terrorism in this country, and then, you know, we have this School of Americas, where they're training terrorists in Central and South America to terrorize their own populations down there.
[01:15:30.085 --> 01:15:31.146]  That's up in Georgia.
[01:15:31.206 --> 01:15:38.972]  They also have one in Alabama, where they train them how to blow buildings up, and the very people who were trained at the school are then suddenly Al-Qaeda bombing us.
[01:15:39.412 --> 01:15:40.433]  Yeah, right.
[01:15:40.934 --> 01:15:41.174]  Wow.
[01:15:44.782 --> 01:15:47.605]  I'm a documentary filmmaker in my own right.
[01:15:48.226 --> 01:15:50.889]  I can tell you authoritatively the Global has carried 9-1-1 out.
[01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:54.152]  I've seen your documentary.
[01:15:54.313 --> 01:15:55.033]  Which one did you see?
[01:15:56.875 --> 01:15:59.198]  The one on 9-11.
[01:15:59.238 --> 01:16:01.200]  Was it video clips or was it just me and a desk?
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:02.620]  You at a desk.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:03.441]  No, that's not it.
[01:16:03.461 --> 01:16:05.501]  That's a TV show called 9-1-1.
[01:16:05.762 --> 01:16:07.902]  Everybody seems to have seen that, but not the actual video.
[01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:09.603]  I made that like a month after it happened.
[01:16:09.623 --> 01:16:10.764]  That was just me in front of a desk.
[01:16:10.904 --> 01:16:12.124]  I've got to send you the real video.
[01:16:12.284 --> 01:16:13.125]  I'd like to see that, yes.
[01:16:13.145 --> 01:16:14.505]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:16:14.545 --> 01:16:15.005]  Stay there.
[01:16:15.225 --> 01:16:17.206]  Yeah, that's just a little TV show I did.
[01:16:17.606 --> 01:16:19.627]  See, I called it Road to Tyranny Emergency Release.
[01:16:20.087 --> 01:16:22.188]  Then I made the real video, where it's not me at a desk.
[01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:23.629]  Stay there.
[01:16:24.129 --> 01:16:27.490]  I want to come back and detail some of this stuff.
[01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:28.591]  Get into certain areas.
[01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:32.834]  Talk about how to stop this, because when they drop the next hammer, it's all over.
[01:16:34.376 --> 01:16:40.184]  And somehow, folks, we've got to get the new road to tyranny in these people's hands, because so many activists have only seen the one I made a month after the attack.
[01:16:40.204 --> 01:16:41.546]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:45.137 --> 01:16:45.678]  It's here.
[01:16:45.958 --> 01:16:46.658]  It's powerful.
[01:16:46.958 --> 01:16:55.545]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:57.686]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[01:16:57.946 --> 01:17:00.028]  No need for expensive disposable filters.
[01:17:00.288 --> 01:17:04.532]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:10.538]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[01:17:10.739 --> 01:17:12.500]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:15.864]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[01:17:16.084 --> 01:17:17.585]  Get the powerful Berkey now.
[01:17:18.306 --> 01:17:24.449]  For everyday use, for outdoor sporting events, and in the event of a local or national emergency, you'll be prepared.
[01:17:24.789 --> 01:17:25.169]  Normally $279.

[01:17:30.772 --> 01:17:32.973]  Not yet available in California and Iowa.
[01:17:41.849 --> 01:17:48.231]  Ted Pike's monumental new video, Why the Mideast Bleeds, exposes the two main causes of international Arab terrorism.
[01:17:48.311 --> 01:17:51.892]  First, a century of Zionist abuses and atrocity against Palestinians.
[01:17:51.972 --> 01:17:54.733]  Second, evangelical Christian support for such abuses.
[01:17:54.833 --> 01:17:59.175]  The unprecedented video documents how the Talmud incites Israeli aggression.
[01:17:59.215 --> 01:18:03.276]  How the loss of freedom under homeland security results from unconditional support of Israel.
[01:18:03.576 --> 01:18:12.021]  It exposes what really happened in the West Bank under Sharon's 2002 invasion, and how Bush is making possible Israel's control of the entire Mideast.
[01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:14.663]  Michael Collins Piper of the American Free Press says,
[01:18:20.706 --> 01:18:22.007]  It's a must-see.

[01:18:42.399 --> 01:18:46.642]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:18:47.103 --> 01:18:51.646]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:18:52.026 --> 01:18:56.890]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:59.051]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[01:18:59.091 --> 01:19:00.092]  can barely be read.
[01:19:00.112 --> 01:19:01.353]  It has faded that much.
[01:19:01.713 --> 01:19:05.616]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[01:19:05.896 --> 01:19:14.261]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antique parchment paper all ready for framing.

[01:19:36.545 --> 01:19:37.046]  The number 800-686-2237.
[01:19:41.849 --> 01:19:42.290]  Gold.
[01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:43.931]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:44.191 --> 01:19:50.277]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:54.301]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:19:54.642 --> 01:19:56.524]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:19:56.584 --> 01:19:58.886]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:19:59.026 --> 01:20:05.793]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[01:20:06.053 --> 01:20:06.734]  Every day.
[01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:16.002]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[01:20:22.248 --> 01:20:27.511]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[01:20:27.831 --> 01:20:30.432]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:20:32.634 --> 01:20:36.736]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:20:36.896 --> 01:20:37.936]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.889 --> 01:21:05.892]  Coming up in the next hour for about a 20-minute interview, I have one of the war crimes prosecutors from Belgium trying to indict General Tommy Franks and how the global government is freaking out over that.
[01:21:05.912 --> 01:21:10.092]  It's not a UN court, it's a national court in Belgium with all the eyewitnesses.
[01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:13.493]  We had one of the doctors on last week where the Marines would kill children.
[01:21:13.513 --> 01:21:16.634]  He would confront them and they'd say, we love killing children.
[01:21:16.654 --> 01:21:18.574]  Then we have from a counterpunch,
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:20.240]  We're good to go.
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:20.601]  We're good to go.
[01:21:20.641 --> 01:21:21.121]  We're good to go.
[01:21:45.553 --> 01:21:51.236]  We don't get these activists, I'm sure he knows, but the general activists out there to realize the whole system's fried.
[01:21:51.696 --> 01:21:58.360]  We're not going to really get changes here, but I want to get a copy of his film because it sounds really good and informative.
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:06.023]  Frank, continuing, talking about this mind control, this mass hypnosis, they admit that's what it is.
[01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:07.724]  How does your film get into that?
[01:22:09.765 --> 01:22:12.727]  It focuses on mainstream media.
[01:22:14.344 --> 01:22:16.465]  It is a dissemination of information in this country.
[01:22:16.485 --> 01:22:19.007]  It's what most people listen to and hear.
[01:22:19.127 --> 01:22:41.359]  They watch mainstream TV and read mainstream newspapers and they're being constantly told 24-7, you know, what the truth is, what's happening, what it is and people like you and me come along and other people are trying to reveal truth and we don't have that kind of access to the mainstream and what we're saying sounds so offbeat, it sounds so weird, it sounds so un-American.
[01:22:41.679 --> 01:22:42.980]  But it's really just history.
[01:22:43.639 --> 01:22:44.639]  I understand, believe me.
[01:22:44.979 --> 01:22:56.082]  And I think the beauty of my tape is that the people on here are known people and they're believable, they've been there, and they're telling this history in a way that it's hard to stay in denial after you watch the tape.
[01:22:56.262 --> 01:22:57.902]  So it gets people out of the box.
[01:22:57.922 --> 01:23:06.984]  An example of propaganda, Fox two days ago was asking, you know, Peterson and the Peterson murder case, oh he's changed his haircut, that was the big news all day.
[01:23:07.324 --> 01:23:08.284]  Yesterday it was.
[01:23:09.028 --> 01:23:11.871]  For the listener line, is it time for talking with Iran?
[01:23:11.951 --> 01:23:14.094]  Time for talking or time for tomahawking?
[01:23:14.755 --> 01:23:17.498]  I mean, it's just turned into mindless drumbeat propaganda.
[01:23:17.798 --> 01:23:18.679]  Yeah, it sure is.
[01:23:18.759 --> 01:23:19.180]  It's really...
[01:23:20.228 --> 01:23:27.374]  Almost unbelievable to those of us that know what's going on, how they can do this and get away with it, because what they're talking about is killing people all over the planet.
[01:23:27.614 --> 01:23:40.545]  Well now they say, hey, it was bureaucratic, Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld, we never needed to find weapons of mass destruction, we won't find them now, probably still will make something up, and by the way, we're going to go ahead and invade Iran or they're going to nuke us.
[01:23:42.506 --> 01:23:48.912]  Yeah, it's just almost complete control of what comes out, and the mainstream media, they have no
[01:23:49.861 --> 01:23:50.742]  They have no spine.
[01:23:50.762 --> 01:23:52.644]  No, they have no ability to tell the truth.
[01:23:52.684 --> 01:23:57.888]  If somebody tries to do any kind of reporting investigative journalism, they won't have their job.
[01:23:57.908 --> 01:24:02.572]  Well, they're owned by GE and Lockheed Martin and they're owned by the globalists.
[01:24:02.873 --> 01:24:03.333]  Exactly.
[01:24:03.794 --> 01:24:04.274]  Exactly.
[01:24:04.614 --> 01:24:07.637]  That's one of the main issues you have to tell people about.
[01:24:07.717 --> 01:24:09.018]  They don't understand this.
[01:24:09.879 --> 01:24:14.163]  So, it's a hard one because most people I think are just
[01:24:15.197 --> 01:24:20.620]  They're busy living their own life, trying to make ends meet, dealing with their own personal situations in life.
[01:24:21.941 --> 01:24:25.303]  They put on TV and there's so much fear going on everywhere.
[01:24:26.304 --> 01:24:29.045]  They look around the world and they see there's problems happening all over the planet.
[01:24:30.106 --> 01:24:34.249]  Then it's like, well, they feel good about living here because they don't think it's as bad.
[01:24:35.489 --> 01:24:41.473]  But I have to say that after 9-11 and the election and all this, I think more people are waking up than ever before in this country.
[01:24:42.462 --> 01:24:44.363]  Um, and we have to just go with it, Alex.
[01:24:44.383 --> 01:24:47.564]  You know what you're doing, and other people that are putting the word out.
[01:24:48.505 --> 01:24:59.770]  So, you know, with our book, Addicted to War, and with the video, The War Against the Third World, we're trying to show as many Americans as possible what they haven't been taught, what most people don't know.
[01:24:59.790 --> 01:25:02.932]  Of course, a lot of people don't want to know, because it's kind of overwhelming.
[01:25:03.212 --> 01:25:07.374]  You're going to be in Los Angeles in June showing the film, correct?
[01:25:08.014 --> 01:25:10.375]  Yeah, I live in Los Angeles, and they're going to show it at the Lumley Theater.
[01:25:11.564 --> 01:25:16.026]  Fairfax Glen League, June 14th and June 15th, Saturday and Sunday at 9 in the morning.
[01:25:16.046 --> 01:25:19.447]  It's the only time I can get to the theater, but it's a big step.
[01:25:19.467 --> 01:25:21.248]  It's the first time it's been shown at a big theater.
[01:25:21.508 --> 01:25:24.909]  Alright, yeah, we've shown some of ours and had a sellout turn on.
[01:25:25.029 --> 01:25:29.771]  If folks want to buy a copy of the book or the film, how do they do that?
[01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:39.175]  Okay, well, the website is addictedtowar.com, that's the title of the book, addictedtowar.com, and you can go there and order the book or the tape, either one.
[01:25:40.113 --> 01:25:49.681]  My phone number, if you want to call me, I get calls every day from all over the world, all over the country, is 310-838-8131.
[01:25:49.821 --> 01:25:50.562]  I'll repeat it, 310-838-8131.
[01:25:50.642 --> 01:25:59.769]  And if people want to send, I ask $10 for the book, $10 for the tape.
[01:25:59.889 --> 01:26:02.231]  I make them real inexpensive.
[01:26:02.271 --> 01:26:02.691]  My P.O.
[01:26:02.731 --> 01:26:06.534]  Box, it's Frank Dorrell, D-O-R-R-E-L, P.O.
[01:26:06.574 --> 01:26:06.875]  Box 3261.
[01:26:09.233 --> 01:26:12.556]  Culver City, C-U-L-V-E-R, City, California, 90231.
[01:26:14.637 --> 01:26:16.058]  All right, we've got to let you go.
[01:26:16.098 --> 01:26:19.381]  I really appreciate you coming on the show and I appreciate your work, Frank.
[01:26:19.461 --> 01:26:22.483]  I'm trying to get alternative media people promoted here on the show.
[01:26:22.884 --> 01:26:23.204]  All right.
[01:26:23.424 --> 01:26:25.766]  And so I really appreciate you coming on and good work.
[01:26:25.826 --> 01:26:26.246]  Keep it up.
[01:26:26.446 --> 01:26:26.987]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:26:27.007 --> 01:26:27.227]  You bet.
[01:26:27.387 --> 01:26:28.108]  All right, I'm going to come back.
[01:26:28.128 --> 01:26:28.768]  Keep up the good work.
[01:26:28.908 --> 01:26:29.169]  You bet.
[01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.389]  Thank you.
[01:26:29.409 --> 01:26:31.050]  I'm going to come back and cover news and take calls.
[01:26:33.011 --> 01:26:33.912]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.393 --> 01:26:35.914]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.901 --> 01:26:39.662]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.903 --> 01:26:44.523]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:26:44.884 --> 01:26:50.625]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:26:50.885 --> 01:26:53.526]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible.
[01:26:53.566 --> 01:26:53.946]  Water 888-803-4438.
[01:26:53.966 --> 01:26:54.707]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:26:54.747 --> 01:26:55.447]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:14.311]  All right, folks.
[01:27:14.411 --> 01:27:20.533]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central, back from 9 to midnight central, 1am to 4am central.
[01:27:21.873 --> 01:27:26.174]  We blast out on a growing list of wonderful AM and FM stations that I guess will get bought up now.
[01:27:26.194 --> 01:27:28.615]  They're going to change the rules so one company can buy everything.
[01:27:28.635 --> 01:27:29.816]  Ha ha!
[01:27:30.236 --> 01:27:34.197]  No, you need to support those stations so they stay around, folks, when they're getting offered five times what they're worth.
[01:27:35.504 --> 01:27:38.526]  And we use simulcast from Global Shortwave and the Internet.
[01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:42.188]  The Internet sites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:27:42.208 --> 01:27:46.771]  We're going to take calls and to cover some of the news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:51.054]  The total free number to join us on this live Friday edition is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:27:51.074 --> 01:27:51.434]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:27:51.474 --> 01:27:53.175]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[01:27:53.215 --> 01:27:57.238]  What do you think about all the news that's been discussed?
[01:28:05.225 --> 01:28:13.467]  The biometrics going in the schools, the government carrying out the terror, the government now saying, okay, we knew there weren't weapons of mass destruction, it was just bureaucratic, so what?
[01:28:13.487 --> 01:28:17.828]  We're going to invade more countries now, North Korea, Iran, they're going to start the invasions!
[01:28:19.968 --> 01:28:20.889]  We're about to get into that.
[01:28:20.949 --> 01:28:22.189]  What do you think about all this?
[01:28:22.929 --> 01:28:30.511]  Or Bill Clinton saying, get rid of the 22nd Amendment, George Bush protecting him, blocking Pardon Gate still, the Press Secretary saying this yesterday,
[01:28:33.346 --> 01:28:39.750]  Bush saying he's going to re-authorize the Clinton assault weapons ban with all these added addendums, banning semi-automatic shotguns and more.
[01:28:41.931 --> 01:28:43.212]  It's all coming up.
[01:28:43.272 --> 01:28:45.753]  So, what do you think about this?
[01:28:45.773 --> 01:28:55.819]  1-800-259-9231, or kind of like C-SPAN Journal in the morning, like that lady that called earlier and said, yeah, the Kansas City Star says they're going to irradiate the school lunch program food.
[01:28:56.359 --> 01:28:58.760]  I'd heard they were going to do that, but now they're saying they're going to do it.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:28:59.481]  See, isn't that nice?
[01:29:00.293 --> 01:29:11.243]  If you have a news item like that we haven't seen that you need to bring to the attention of the listenership in 30 states on the AM and FM dial and level shortwave worldwide, the internet worldwide.
[01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:13.205]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:13.225 --> 01:29:16.508]  Alright, let me go ahead now and jump into some of the important news items.
[01:29:25.009 --> 01:29:27.671]  Fox asked for action on immigration.
[01:29:27.712 --> 01:29:29.853]  President says Mexicans working in the U.S.
[01:29:29.913 --> 01:29:31.835]  are reliable people, not security risk.
[01:29:33.517 --> 01:29:50.332]  Well, the point is, Mr. Fox, is that when you have ID cards you'll issue to anyone for $22, the matricular card, when you have Poland and a hundred other third world countries now doing it, a hundred plus,
[01:29:51.246 --> 01:29:56.489]  When you have a southern border that's wide open, but the government's saying, take the liberties of citizens, you've got a problem.
[01:29:57.769 --> 01:30:07.054]  There's another article here out of World Net Daily where the government is not allowed to stop or arrest illegals, but they will do that to citizens, as we've been pointing out, at the checkpoints they had last week.
[01:30:08.635 --> 01:30:12.497]  Now some countries gain more foreigners, counties gain more foreigners than U.S.
[01:30:12.957 --> 01:30:14.498]  born, the Arizona Republic reported,
[01:30:15.259 --> 01:30:19.580]  Two migration patterns closely linked are sweeping across population centers of U.S.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.781]  states along the Mexican border.
[01:30:21.381 --> 01:30:28.083]  Many counties are absorbing more immigrants from other nations than from within the United States, and an even more dramatic shift.
[01:30:28.463 --> 01:30:30.784]  Some of the counties are seeing more U.S.
[01:30:31.284 --> 01:30:32.404]  residents move out than U.S.
[01:30:32.444 --> 01:30:33.325]  residents move in.
[01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:37.926]  Together, the trends are escalating the concentration of foreigners in southwestern counties.
[01:30:38.326 --> 01:30:41.127]  But until 1990s, dependent on newcomers,
[01:30:41.747 --> 01:30:43.888]  From other parts of the United States with the bulk of their growth.
[01:30:44.128 --> 01:30:56.531]  The extent of the foreign immigration, coupled with declining or reversing domestic migration or birth rates, has revealed an analysis of the latest Census Bureau estimates for the county populations changes covering April 2000-2002.
[01:30:56.551 --> 01:31:04.014]  They have over a million and a half illegals coming through Cochise County in Arizona alone each year.
[01:31:04.034 --> 01:31:08.295]  Interesting story out of VOA News out of Mexico.
[01:31:09.702 --> 01:31:13.584]  Steps being taken to solve Juarez murders says Mexico's Attorney General.
[01:31:15.305 --> 01:31:29.493]  Mexico's Attorney General Rafael Mercedo de la Concha said important steps are being taken to solve over 300 murders cases involving young women whose bodies have been found in ravines and garbage dumps around the border city of Juarez.
[01:31:29.713 --> 01:31:35.596]  Over the last decade the Attorney General also defended federal probe and the possible origin of trafficking as a motive for the murders.
[01:31:36.351 --> 01:31:39.312]  Well, we forget what Texas Monthly reported almost ten years ago.
[01:31:39.612 --> 01:31:42.012]  And then, a couple years ago, they found more dead bodies.
[01:31:43.133 --> 01:31:46.073]  You let your college kids, even your high school kids, go over the border.
[01:31:47.554 --> 01:31:48.254]  Into this area.
[01:31:48.394 --> 01:31:51.235]  And they are being sacrificed by satanic cults.
[01:31:51.275 --> 01:31:52.035]  Now, that's admitted!
[01:31:53.715 --> 01:31:57.196]  And, uh, they mention that here in the article.
[01:31:59.156 --> 01:32:00.597]  So what do you think about this?
[01:32:00.757 --> 01:32:05.698]  I mean, how bizarre is this that these drug dealers, who sell their drugs predominantly to the CIA,
[01:32:06.653 --> 01:32:07.494]  Are Satanists.
[01:32:07.674 --> 01:32:09.576]  Now, I know that sounds crazy, but it's the fact.
[01:32:10.457 --> 01:32:11.578]  It's more bizarreness.
[01:32:12.219 --> 01:32:13.481]  You remember hearing about that, folks?
[01:32:14.261 --> 01:32:15.563]  300 murders of young women.
[01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:16.544]  They found their bodies.
[01:32:18.126 --> 01:32:20.528]  Mexico plans to x-ray all vehicles at borders.
[01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:23.211]  Mexico is developing an x-ray system.
[01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:25.433]  In developing, it's already on the northern border.
[01:32:25.594 --> 01:32:27.736]  If you're leaving the U.S., they do it to you.
[01:32:27.776 --> 01:32:28.577]  Not if you're coming in.
[01:32:29.645 --> 01:32:30.986]  Harder to get out than to get in.
[01:32:31.506 --> 01:32:33.187]  Slaves can get in, but they can't get out.
[01:32:33.767 --> 01:32:34.167]  Yeah, right.
[01:32:34.187 --> 01:32:34.648]  They walk across.
[01:32:34.668 --> 01:32:36.229]  They don't come across in the trucks generally.
[01:32:36.249 --> 01:32:40.171]  That's a small portion of it, though it is still substantial in the hundreds of thousands.
[01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:55.513]  Turkey's military chief warns pro-Islamist government a possible coup.
[01:32:55.973 --> 01:33:03.415]  Head of Turkey's armed forces warned a government yesterday that the possibility of military intervention still existed and that the government should be sensitive to the country's secularist constitution.
[01:33:04.655 --> 01:33:08.936]  And so this invasion of Iraq is destabilizing as the experts said it would.
[01:33:10.076 --> 01:33:14.777]  Soldier guilty for refusing anthrax shot court-martialed convicts.
[01:33:15.834 --> 01:33:19.057]  Army Reservist from New York refusing to take anthrax vaccine.
[01:33:19.077 --> 01:33:30.566]  Another woman is being court-martialed because she wouldn't take a smallpox shot when she was breastfeeding, though the bottle says, the injector, the ampule container says, do not give to breastfeeding women.
[01:33:31.867 --> 01:33:32.647]  It's out of control.
[01:33:32.667 --> 01:33:39.933]  By the way, this isn't even authorized to be used as experimental, but troops are still being given something that you can't give animals.
[01:33:42.067 --> 01:33:48.970]  Of course you heard on Monday that Bush is assigned a $15 billion government funding system to help fight AIDS.
[01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:49.450]  No, it's not.
[01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:51.851]  It's to give AZT that kills the people.
[01:33:51.871 --> 01:33:53.892]  Something they won't even give cancer patients.
[01:33:53.932 --> 01:33:54.592]  It's too deadly.
[01:33:55.312 --> 01:34:01.394]  And as Tommy Mortis and the Boxer and as Magic Johnson have told you, that's the stuff that kills you.
[01:34:01.414 --> 01:34:02.695]  They're fine because they won't take it.
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:06.961]  So, really, this $15 billion is about population reduction.
[01:34:06.981 --> 01:34:08.482]  It goes into some of the vaccine programs.
[01:34:08.502 --> 01:34:18.045]  But it was the government itself, the BBC, now reported three weeks ago, that has been caught with HIV in the hepatitis and in the polio shots.
[01:34:19.145 --> 01:34:20.506]  By accident, of course, though.
[01:34:21.883 --> 01:34:22.463]  P.O.W.
[01:34:22.503 --> 01:34:24.124]  torture photos investigated.
[01:34:24.144 --> 01:34:26.105]  And again, I know we've got callers.
[01:34:26.365 --> 01:34:27.665]  We'll go to you here in a minute.
[01:34:27.805 --> 01:34:29.006]  Toll-free number to join us.
[01:34:29.026 --> 01:34:30.786]  What do you think about all this news?
[01:34:31.406 --> 01:34:32.227]  At 800-259-9231.
[01:34:32.587 --> 01:34:38.049]  Linda, John, and others, stay right there.
[01:34:38.069 --> 01:34:38.809]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:38.829 --> 01:34:40.270]  P.O.W.
[01:34:42.831 --> 01:34:44.531]  torture photos investigated.
[01:34:44.591 --> 01:34:47.912]  Allegations Iraqi prisoners of war were mistreated by U.K.
[01:34:47.952 --> 01:34:49.313]  troops are being investigated after
[01:34:50.256 --> 01:34:53.237]  Photographers allegedly showing the abuse were discovered.
[01:34:53.817 --> 01:34:56.118]  That includes children, men, people being beaten.
[01:34:56.518 --> 01:34:58.018]  They're dying of cholera, dysentery.
[01:34:58.078 --> 01:35:04.160]  They're in areas in just sand dunes with barbed wire around them, with machine gun nests.
[01:35:04.601 --> 01:35:06.581]  Children sitting in mommy or daddy's lap.
[01:35:06.621 --> 01:35:08.362]  The mommy and daddy have bags over their head.
[01:35:08.382 --> 01:35:09.482]  They're not being fed.
[01:35:09.502 --> 01:35:10.682]  People are dying in mass.
[01:35:11.103 --> 01:35:12.263]  They're machine gunning people.
[01:35:13.937 --> 01:35:14.478]  That's okay.
[01:35:14.518 --> 01:35:16.240]  Iraq mass murder, freed and mixed up.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:16.740]  Yeah, sure.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.924]  The Ba'athists are all CIA folks, and that's what they're putting into power now, the Ba'athists.
[01:35:20.345 --> 01:35:21.826]  Ten people who ran Saddam's regime.
[01:35:22.287 --> 01:35:22.527]  The U.S.
[01:35:22.547 --> 01:35:27.032]  has admitted it accidentally released a former Iraqi official accused of being involved in the murder of thousands of Shiites.
[01:35:27.072 --> 01:35:27.953]  They say it's an accident.
[01:35:29.095 --> 01:35:34.501]  But they have the British investigating the Americans, and the Americans investigating the British, and they always say, oh, we're good.
[01:35:36.047 --> 01:35:40.492]  The Age Out of Australia reporting anti-American anger as soldiers search homes.
[01:35:40.532 --> 01:35:46.639]  Authorities are trying to keep a lid on things, but in Iraqi town of Het, it's all too much.
[01:35:48.881 --> 01:35:51.644]  Keep a lid on by Tyler Marshall.
[01:35:52.625 --> 01:35:55.248]  One of the third consecutive day of violence against the U.S.
[01:35:55.268 --> 01:35:57.491]  military occupation situation finally exploded.
[01:35:58.536 --> 01:36:01.479]  Curious about house-to-house searches in the western town of Hett.
[01:36:01.979 --> 01:36:04.181]  Mobs ransacked the police station, stoned U.S.
[01:36:04.221 --> 01:36:06.684]  armored vehicles, and set police cars on fire.
[01:36:07.444 --> 01:36:20.276]  With people still roaming the streets at dusk fell, it was impossible to say exactly what triggered the riot, but in interviews laced with anti-American rage and threats of vengeance, residents said the problems began when police allegedly assisted U.S.
[01:36:20.296 --> 01:36:22.078]  troops searching homes for weapons.
[01:36:22.298 --> 01:36:23.259]  Gun confiscation, folks.
[01:36:24.022 --> 01:36:27.044]  If night fell on Wednesday, there was no sign of either of the police or U.S.
[01:36:27.064 --> 01:36:32.008]  forces in the town, and plumes of smoke billowed into the air as the remains of the two police cars burned.
[01:36:32.028 --> 01:36:36.611]  Pentagon said it was aware of the anti-American disturbances in several cities on Wednesday, including Ette.
[01:36:38.372 --> 01:36:44.377]  Already this week, ambushes in Baghdad on Tuesday in the city of Baljala on Monday and Tuesday have left four U.S.
[01:36:44.417 --> 01:36:45.318]  soldiers dead and 15 wounded.
[01:36:46.639 --> 01:36:54.643]  As in the earlier incidents, the violence and hate appear to have been driven, at least in part, by the fury of living conditions that have plunged the lives of many into chaos.
[01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:58.665]  Even in Kurd areas, the Kurds are rioting.
[01:36:58.725 --> 01:36:59.486]  It's so horrible.
[01:36:59.526 --> 01:37:02.787]  How would you like not having water or power and people searching your house for guns?
[01:37:03.528 --> 01:37:09.631]  By the way, I hear the neocon, ultra-socialist, big government liars on radio and TV saying, Help!
[01:37:09.671 --> 01:37:10.391]  They're the liberals!
[01:37:10.431 --> 01:37:11.352]  Say it's an occupation!
[01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:12.132]  It's a liberation!
[01:37:12.612 --> 01:37:15.054]  Our own government, two weeks ago, said it is an occupation.
[01:37:15.134 --> 01:37:15.414]  Okay?
[01:37:18.217 --> 01:37:21.799]  Minister confirms that cluster bombs were used on civilian areas, London Independent.
[01:37:21.839 --> 01:37:25.480]  British troops used cluster bombs in built-up areas during the war in Iraq.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.341]  The government confirmed for the first time yesterday.
[01:37:28.362 --> 01:37:37.886]  Adam Ingram of the Armed Forces Minister insisted that the use of controversial weapons in Basra was justified because they were directed at Iraqi military units posing a threat to the British troops' lives.
[01:37:37.906 --> 01:37:46.350]  The Minister made his comments to the Independent, revealed they had written a letter in the run-up to the war, according to there were occasions when the use of cluster bombs against certain targets would not be legal.
[01:37:47.037 --> 01:37:49.739]  By the way, they say, oh, support the troops, don't criticize the war.
[01:37:50.219 --> 01:37:54.181]  Our troops were injected with deadly anthrax shots, hit with nerve gas and not treated.
[01:37:54.462 --> 01:37:55.322]  And that's now a fact.
[01:37:55.342 --> 01:37:57.864]  But you don't really support the troops, do you, out there airheads?
[01:37:58.864 --> 01:38:00.105]  You support the New World Order.
[01:38:00.425 --> 01:38:05.228]  I'm talking to the minority out there, the neocons, who think, you know, the Hillary Clinton type.
[01:38:05.248 --> 01:38:06.329]  You know, Hillary's for the war.
[01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:08.150]  U.S.
[01:38:08.170 --> 01:38:10.891]  gunfire kills three teens at a wedding, Sydney Morning Herald.
[01:38:11.592 --> 01:38:11.772]  U.S.
[01:38:11.812 --> 01:38:16.495]  soldiers opened fire on a festive wedding parade earlier this week, killing three teenagers and wounding seven others after
[01:38:17.918 --> 01:38:20.219]  Celebrants fire weapons in the air, which they normally do.
[01:38:20.679 --> 01:38:26.380]  Shooting on Monday night was only one in a series of deadly incidents this week that have sharply increased tension between the U.S.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.540]  troops and Iraqi civilians.
[01:38:28.181 --> 01:38:32.222]  By the way, if one gun goes off, Marines just fired any crowd that's seen.
[01:38:32.242 --> 01:38:36.043]  They're going to come back here and be police officers, folks.
[01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:37.843]  The incident highlights a clash of cultures.
[01:38:38.263 --> 01:38:42.024]  It's popular custom in Iraq to fire weapons in the air to celebrate weddings and other festivities.
[01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:46.713]  But the practice has been prohibited under new weapons policy being enforced by U.S.
[01:38:46.753 --> 01:38:47.093]  troops.
[01:38:48.414 --> 01:38:50.675]  Three teams remain in very critical condition on Wednesday.
[01:38:51.136 --> 01:38:59.661]  Four other young people were in stable condition, said Dr. Abul Rahman, who helped treat many of the victims at the Samara General Hospital, a 90-minute drive north of Baghdad.
[01:39:02.043 --> 01:39:03.604]  Oh my goodness, it goes on and on.
[01:39:03.624 --> 01:39:05.825]  It goes on and on.
[01:39:05.886 --> 01:39:08.087]  Rumsfeld, new line on missing arms.
[01:39:08.207 --> 01:39:09.408]  Iraq may have destroyed its
[01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:13.450]  Reported chemical weapons and biological weapons before it was invaded in March.
[01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:25.094]  The United States Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld just said, well yeah, the stuff our government sold them and you were the bag man for the sales in the mid-eighties, Rumsfeld, were bombed by our illegitimate government and were destroyed.
[01:39:25.134 --> 01:39:25.894]  Our troops breathed it.
[01:39:27.855 --> 01:39:33.177]  And now it's coming out that the documents, all the documents the government brought forward were fake and false.
[01:39:33.197 --> 01:39:34.417]  A bunch of articles about that.
[01:39:34.998 --> 01:39:35.638]  Here's another one.
[01:39:36.878 --> 01:39:37.078]  U.S.
[01:39:37.098 --> 01:39:38.799]  military plans against
[01:39:39.714 --> 01:39:43.015]  I ran ready, and that's Rumsfeld.
[01:39:44.116 --> 01:39:46.837]  Also, no bunker where U.S.
[01:39:46.897 --> 01:39:48.017]  bombs target Saddam.
[01:39:48.057 --> 01:39:49.117]  Turns out our government knew.
[01:39:49.157 --> 01:39:50.598]  Reuters is reporting that nothing was there.
[01:39:50.618 --> 01:39:55.940]  It was totally staged to claim they killed Saddam when they'd already flown the guy out from Tikrit under military escort to Russia.
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:00.361]  And see, they're never going to catch Saddam.
[01:40:00.481 --> 01:40:08.264]  If we can play a lot, what they will do is they will grab one of his doubles and then try that guy.
[01:40:10.044 --> 01:40:16.249]  The Baghdad bunker, which the United States said it bombed on the opening night of the Iraq war in a bid to kill Saddam Hussein, never existed.
[01:40:16.269 --> 01:40:17.890]  CBS Evening News reported Wednesday.
[01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:18.730]  So there you go.
[01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:20.011]  Totally staged theater.
[01:40:20.952 --> 01:40:21.733]  About to go to your calls.
[01:40:22.253 --> 01:40:25.015]  Rumsfeld pushes for regime change in Iran.
[01:40:25.495 --> 01:40:26.636]  This is Financial Times.
[01:40:26.696 --> 01:40:27.497]  Donald Rumsfeld, U.S.
[01:40:27.517 --> 01:40:31.400]  Defense Secretary, is spearheading efforts to fight regime change in Iran.
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:38.785]  The official policy goal of the Bush administration for this campaign is meeting with considerable resistance from senior figures, according to officials and analysis.
[01:40:39.508 --> 01:40:54.743]  And of course it says, it's the State Department says it's not right, it's not good, and as soon as they build up the troops in Massimore, and threaten us with nukes, saying Iran's gonna nuke us, suddenly Powell will say, okay, it's good, and they'll go, oh look, even the Dove is for the war now.
[01:40:54.803 --> 01:40:56.185]  This is totally staged.
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:57.860]  A reassessment of U.S.
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:04.721]  policy towards Iran coincides with an initiative launched by powerful conservative figures than the Islamic Republic to engage in the U.S.
[01:41:04.761 --> 01:41:09.582]  in an attempt to restore relations and thereby preserve the clerical regime in Tehran.
[01:41:10.943 --> 01:41:24.365]  Rumsfeld has now come out and has a dossier for an attack plan starting as soon as next month with aircraft broadcasting over their TV and radio stations, here they just buy them up, putting out propaganda for the overthrow which will escalate
[01:41:24.938 --> 01:41:30.060]  They've also leaked, on purpose, an invasion plan for October 2003 for U.S.
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:40.825]  forces to attack preemptively North Korea, which could then push Kim Jong-il into launching Taepong Gong 2s and 3s at the U.S.
[01:41:40.905 --> 01:41:41.385]  mainland.
[01:41:41.405 --> 01:41:45.687]  It can hit dozens of western states, from Alaska to California.
[01:41:45.767 --> 01:41:48.648]  Again, this was a 10-part plan to get the Japanese to attack.
[01:41:48.949 --> 01:41:49.629]  Same thing again.
[01:41:51.084 --> 01:41:54.925]  When that nuke hits, if it does, American life will never be the same, folks.
[01:41:54.945 --> 01:42:01.946]  According to one official, Condoleezza Rice, National Security Advisor, has slipped in to freeze the fierce debate with the administration of Iran.
[01:42:01.966 --> 01:42:02.966]  The official denied reports.
[01:42:02.986 --> 01:42:05.887]  A high-level policy meeting on Iran was held on Tuesday.
[01:42:07.287 --> 01:42:08.167]  On Thursday, excuse me.
[01:42:10.667 --> 01:42:11.888]  I got a lot of other news coming up.
[01:42:11.948 --> 01:42:14.588]  Let's talk to Brett in Alaska.
[01:42:14.608 --> 01:42:15.468]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:42:15.508 --> 01:42:15.948]  Go ahead.
[01:42:16.988 --> 01:42:18.109]  Yeah, good morning, Alex.
[01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.569]  How you doing?
[01:42:18.829 --> 01:42:19.269]  Fine, sir.
[01:42:20.269 --> 01:42:20.469]  Good.
[01:42:20.894 --> 01:42:22.355]  Hey, I just wanted to mention something.
[01:42:22.375 --> 01:42:24.036]  A couple things I've been seeing on TV.
[01:42:24.156 --> 01:42:25.776]  With the commercials, a lot of commercials.
[01:42:26.677 --> 01:42:30.079]  The, uh, I don't know, I just saw this yesterday for the first time.
[01:42:30.099 --> 01:42:31.099]  The New Zealand commercial.
[01:42:31.359 --> 01:42:42.905]  There's a roll-on ad for antiperspirant where SWAT teams are running around aiming guns at you and you've got the arid extra dry so you're okay with them.
[01:42:43.965 --> 01:42:44.185]  Yeah.
[01:42:44.445 --> 01:42:45.346]  Is that what you're talking about?
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:47.522]  Yeah, well, not that one.
[01:42:47.623 --> 01:42:53.814]  Dell just came out with a new commercial, and it all talks about torture and stuff, and they got people hooked up to all this equipment and stuff.
[01:42:55.196 --> 01:42:56.298]  You're kidding.
[01:42:56.318 --> 01:42:58.082]  Tell me what the Dell commercial does.
[01:42:59.304 --> 01:43:07.728]  One thing I'm noticing a lot, too, in any of your commercials that have any kind of landscape scene or anything like that, chemtrails.
[01:43:07.968 --> 01:43:10.670]  They're always showing chemtrails now in the sky scenes.
[01:43:10.930 --> 01:43:13.771]  Yeah, conditioning you, that's okay, but let me ask you a question.
[01:43:13.831 --> 01:43:14.331]  Exactly.
[01:43:15.212 --> 01:43:16.432]  I've got another thing.
[01:43:16.512 --> 01:43:18.253]  Here's an interesting thing that happened to me.
[01:43:18.333 --> 01:43:20.714]  I'll hold you over if you need me, okay?
[01:43:20.955 --> 01:43:22.715]  I want to hear about the Dell torture commercial.
[01:43:23.016 --> 01:43:23.816]  Describe it for us.
[01:43:25.453 --> 01:43:26.934]  Well, I'm trying to remember exactly.
[01:43:27.054 --> 01:43:33.658]  Well, it shows that they've got a helmet on the guy, and he's sitting in the chair, and they're, you know, trying to convince him he's got to buy a Dell computer.
[01:43:34.718 --> 01:43:47.185]  And he goes through a number of other things, different kind of things, and then the commercial, right toward the end, it goes into some other really bizarre stuff.
[01:43:49.485 --> 01:44:03.543]  But the thing that I wanted to really bring up is that when I was down on Anchorage, actually I was on the website for the airport there, Ted Stevens International Airport, and they built a railroad out to the airport.
[01:44:04.426 --> 01:44:05.727]  I thought that was kind of odd.
[01:44:05.847 --> 01:44:06.787]  Well, they admit.
[01:44:06.807 --> 01:44:13.670]  I have the article out of Indiana where they admit they built a railroad spur to the airport to fly, quote, detainees out.
[01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:17.611]  They're building infrastructures for millions of Americans to be moved quickly.
[01:44:18.111 --> 01:44:20.632]  And they admit in mainstream news they built large FEMA camps.
[01:44:21.873 --> 01:44:22.313]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:22.433 --> 01:44:22.753]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:22.773 --> 01:44:23.774]  I'm aware of all that.
[01:44:23.854 --> 01:44:28.175]  But what was interesting about the air inquiry thing is I ran into that about two weeks ago.
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.701]  About a week and a half out of town.
[01:44:31.741 --> 01:44:32.762]  I live out in the bush here.
[01:44:32.822 --> 01:44:38.606]  I just spent a week in Anchorage and then I went down to the Conspiracy Con down there in Santa Clara.
[01:44:39.766 --> 01:44:43.809]  And when I was in Anchorage, I was talking to people, you know, about the railroad.
[01:44:43.869 --> 01:44:46.711]  I ran into like six people who didn't know anything about it.
[01:44:47.451 --> 01:44:52.235]  Then I was talking to my brother-in-law, who's a major contractor in Anchorage.
[01:44:52.375 --> 01:44:55.076]  I want to hear the details of this when we get back.
[01:44:55.697 --> 01:44:57.238]  And I've got some comments about
[01:44:58.135 --> 01:45:01.196]  Dell New World Order Computer Anti-Gun Systems.
[01:45:03.877 --> 01:45:10.680]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:12.401]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:45:12.601 --> 01:45:14.821]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:45:14.961 --> 01:45:17.042]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:45:17.302 --> 01:45:22.244]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:45:22.584 --> 01:45:26.626]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:45:26.866 --> 01:45:28.647]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:45:28.727 --> 01:45:39.373]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:45:39.534 --> 01:45:41.415]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:46:06.859 --> 01:46:10.360]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:14.401]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:20.762]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:46:21.182 --> 01:46:29.084]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:46:29.504 --> 01:46:34.848]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[01:46:35.008 --> 01:46:38.771]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:46:39.151 --> 01:46:41.013]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[01:46:41.073 --> 01:46:43.255]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[01:48:11.187 --> 01:48:14.007]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:15.147 --> 01:48:17.188]  Yeah, Michael Dell's big in with the boys.
[01:48:17.928 --> 01:48:19.868]  I'm right here in Austin, Texas, where he's based.
[01:48:19.928 --> 01:48:22.989]  They're getting rid of a lot of their employees, moving their main plants to China.
[01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:31.171]  But, about two years ago, Dell got caught when somebody from a fire manufacturer that sells to police
[01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:40.272]  Combat Firearms tried to buy a computer, and they said no, because this is listed as something that has to be reported to the government as a terrorist action.
[01:48:42.252 --> 01:48:49.333]  And I know of four people who've been fired from Tennessee to Austin, where they're based, if they visit InfoWars.com.
[01:48:49.353 --> 01:48:54.174]  They have a policy you can surf at lunch, but you can't go to porn, gambling, hacking, or terror.
[01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:57.075]  Well, my website's all mainstream news articles and government bills.
[01:48:57.910 --> 01:49:03.352]  I mean, you know, we have city council people on, and congressmen, and it's really mainstream when it comes to the facts.
[01:49:04.552 --> 01:49:10.694]  And now I just found out from the folks that host InfoWars.com, they also host a pro-life website.
[01:49:10.754 --> 01:49:11.514]  It's just pro-life.
[01:49:11.534 --> 01:49:12.515]  It's a big pro-life group.
[01:49:13.335 --> 01:49:17.737]  And they found out that an employee got fired from Dell, who visited that.
[01:49:17.757 --> 01:49:20.377]  They called him in and said this is a terrorist website and they're not allowed to visit it.
[01:49:21.118 --> 01:49:22.378]  So that's Dell, folks.
[01:49:22.438 --> 01:49:25.039]  If you've got a mainstream gun group, or anything,
[01:49:25.803 --> 01:49:28.204]  They're firing employees left and right if you visit it.
[01:49:28.485 --> 01:49:31.346]  And they do all this, and they've got these horrible ads.
[01:49:31.706 --> 01:49:32.647]  They're moving to China.
[01:49:32.667 --> 01:49:34.008]  I didn't know about the new torture ad.
[01:49:34.028 --> 01:49:34.768]  I haven't confirmed that.
[01:49:34.788 --> 01:49:36.289]  I mean, I believe Brett from Alaska.
[01:49:37.050 --> 01:49:39.771]  But it's all part of acclimating us that all this is okay.
[01:49:40.331 --> 01:49:43.053]  And so we should all boycott Dell and continue to boycott Dell.
[01:49:43.093 --> 01:49:43.633]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:49:43.653 --> 01:49:46.175]  You had a point about the railway head to the airport.
[01:49:46.215 --> 01:49:46.535]  Go ahead.
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:48.600]  Yeah.
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:57.444]  Anyway, just recapping, I had been in Anchorage for about a week before I went down to Santa Clara to the Conspiracy Con, and I was, you know, running around, talking to people.
[01:49:57.464 --> 01:49:59.945]  I said, you hear about the railroad out at the airport?
[01:49:59.985 --> 01:50:02.466]  And a number of people didn't know anything about it at all.
[01:50:03.346 --> 01:50:08.468]  And then, like I said, my brother-in-law's a big contractor, painting contractor, in the Anchorage area.
[01:50:09.069 --> 01:50:17.132]  And he didn't know anything about this project at all until it was announced in the paper that this thing was done.
[01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:19.210]  And what do they say it was for?
[01:50:20.731 --> 01:50:23.211]  Well, they're saying it's for hauling tourists.
[01:50:23.912 --> 01:50:32.794]  Well, if you know anything about the tourist industry in Alaska, there's really no need to have a railroad going into Anchorage to haul tourists.
[01:50:32.934 --> 01:50:34.054]  Well, I'll just say this, Brent.
[01:50:34.074 --> 01:50:35.555]  And haul tourists down to Seward.
[01:50:35.995 --> 01:50:40.036]  Yeah, Brent, I appreciate your call.
[01:50:40.096 --> 01:50:40.416]  Thank you.
[01:50:40.936 --> 01:50:41.816]  Let me just say this.
[01:50:42.417 --> 01:50:42.797]  Thank you.
[01:50:43.297 --> 01:50:47.198]  There's really no need to even talk about this story, and I'm glad you called in about it, but
[01:50:47.777 --> 01:50:49.798]  You have Rocky Mountain News, AP, Reuters.
[01:50:51.138 --> 01:50:51.938]  Monday, U.S.
[01:50:51.978 --> 01:50:52.919]  announces death camps.
[01:50:53.019 --> 01:50:54.619]  I'll dig that article out and cover it next hour.
[01:50:55.059 --> 01:50:57.180]  You can't just cover something like that on Monday and leave it alone.
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.160]  You've got to recap the week.
[01:50:59.241 --> 01:51:00.321]  They say it's a death camp.
[01:51:00.341 --> 01:51:04.482]  They say it's for, quote, terrorists, but the definition of terrorism is anything.
[01:51:05.322 --> 01:51:10.564]  And they admit they're building these camps, and that's mainstream news, and it's in my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:51:10.824 --> 01:51:16.506]  They have a large 20-minute segment of the 2-hour and 37-minute film, a large 20-minute segment of the film,
[01:51:17.253 --> 01:51:22.437]  is about the camps all mainstream news articles and bills and public officials speaking out.
[01:51:23.358 --> 01:51:26.000]  So you need to get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:29.783]  You need to get it, you need to make copies, you need to get it out to everybody in your area.
[01:51:30.563 --> 01:51:31.484]  And tell everybody.
[01:51:31.664 --> 01:51:35.067]  A lot of corporations now are sharing lists of websites they're blocking.
[01:51:35.127 --> 01:51:35.888]  Mine's one of them.
[01:51:36.408 --> 01:51:37.589]  So turn the heat up.

[01:52:52.294 --> 01:52:55.215]  Hello, everybody.
[01:52:55.275 --> 01:53:00.838]  My name is Bob Barefoot, and I'm here today to introduce Bob Barefoot's Best Coil Calcium Supreme Plus.
[01:53:00.998 --> 01:53:05.120]  It has twice as much of the high-grade marine coil calcium from OCS.
[01:53:08.902 --> 01:53:12.064]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.772 --> 01:53:20.413]  Big Brother.
[01:53:21.073 --> 01:53:22.134]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.834 --> 01:53:23.995]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.015 --> 01:53:25.436]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.177 --> 01:53:27.078]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.098 --> 01:53:31.381]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.941 --> 01:53:36.064]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:37.645 --> 01:53:44.871]  Already into the third and final hour of this live Friday edition, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:53:46.551 --> 01:53:51.452]  Last Friday, I had a doctor who had been in Iraq for the duration of the war and before the war.
[01:53:51.472 --> 01:53:57.094]  I saw them shooting women and children indiscriminately and engaging in celebratory dances over the killing of children.
[01:53:57.114 --> 01:53:59.755]  This is all part of the new freedom.
[01:54:00.655 --> 01:54:03.916]  And Brussels, with its constitution, can have its own war crimes trial.
[01:54:03.936 --> 01:54:05.036]  It's not a UN trial.
[01:54:07.417 --> 01:54:15.559]  And I've got some articles on Infowars.com about the guests that we have on
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:17.115]  Lawyer Jan.
[01:54:18.675 --> 01:54:24.379]  Berman presented the complaint against Franks, that's General Franks, the head of the takeover of Iraq.
[01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:26.621]  Lieutenant Colonel P.B.
[01:54:26.661 --> 01:54:28.402]  McCoy, commander of the 3rd Battalion U.S.
[01:54:28.422 --> 01:54:35.127]  Marines, a federal prosecutor despite recent charges in Belgium, war crimes and deflation to prevent such charges against Americans.
[01:54:35.548 --> 01:54:39.110]  The accusations against Franks focus on the bombing of civilian areas and discriminated shooting by U.S.
[01:54:39.130 --> 01:54:41.952]  troops when they entered Baghdad and the failure to stop the looting.
[01:54:42.353 --> 01:54:46.796]  Fox News ran the footage, and was real proud of it, of people sitting on the tank shooting
[01:54:47.356 --> 01:54:49.417]  Civilian cars were on the other lane.
[01:54:49.858 --> 01:54:51.939]  People falling out with bullet holes in them.
[01:54:52.039 --> 01:54:54.020]  Dead children splattered all over the road.
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:55.641]  They cut away real quick.
[01:54:56.801 --> 01:54:58.022]  This is really embarrassing.
[01:54:58.042 --> 01:54:59.443]  And this isn't America that did this.
[01:54:59.503 --> 01:55:01.084]  It's the bankers that run this country.
[01:55:02.164 --> 01:55:05.586]  Jan Furman, again, bringing forward this evidence.
[01:55:06.927 --> 01:55:08.748]  I appreciate you coming on the show today, sir.
[01:55:08.768 --> 01:55:09.708]  It's my pleasure.
[01:55:10.509 --> 01:55:16.692]  Tell us what's really going on and how this war crimes trial is being blocked.
[01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:26.772]  Well, we filed a complaint on behalf of 17 Iraqis and 2 Jordanians, as you probably know.
[01:55:26.792 --> 01:55:44.416]  Through recent amendment of the law, the Belgian government has the possibility now to decide to pass over the file to the US, which they say they intend to do, but there's no formal decision yet.
[01:55:46.532 --> 01:55:57.602]  And of course we will fight that decision because it's very clear that Iraqi civilian victims cannot get a fair trial before a U.S.
[01:55:57.682 --> 01:56:06.030]  military court that would have to go into war crimes committed by U.S.
[01:56:06.050 --> 01:56:09.553]  troops in Iraq and more especially by the supreme command of those troops.
[01:56:13.257 --> 01:56:14.498]  So it's being blocked.
[01:56:15.239 --> 01:56:17.220]  What are some of the crimes that are being alleged?
[01:56:19.021 --> 01:56:23.865]  We have five types of incidents which we are pointing at.
[01:56:23.905 --> 01:56:34.973]  It's one, as you said before, the indiscriminate shooting of when US troops went into Baghdad.
[01:56:35.013 --> 01:56:36.614]  The indiscriminate shooting at civilians.
[01:56:39.312 --> 01:56:50.978]  The second program is about firing and attacking press journalists, buildings of press organs.
[01:56:52.879 --> 01:57:02.024]  We have some incidents related to the use of cluster bombs in civilian areas, more especially children picking up unexploded
[01:57:04.510 --> 01:57:09.411]  Bomblets from these cluster bombs and being very seriously injured by that.
[01:57:10.672 --> 01:57:14.133]  There is some incidents related to the looting.
[01:57:15.213 --> 01:57:22.255]  A small cultural center, independent cultural center, that was completely destroyed with US troops just standing there.
[01:57:22.295 --> 01:57:30.557]  And the three main incidents, which I think are the most serious incidents, are three incidents in which
[01:57:31.901 --> 01:57:32.261]  I think?
[01:57:50.986 --> 01:58:00.876]  All the laws of war expressly forbid aggression and attacks against medical infrastructure and medical personnel.
[01:58:00.896 --> 01:58:02.057]  All right, stay right there.
[01:58:02.238 --> 01:58:10.025]  The Belgian doctor we had on last week actually witnessed some of that, by the way, and when he confronted Marines about this, they just said, we love to kill children.
[01:58:10.826 --> 01:58:12.167]  We love to kill children.
[01:58:12.808 --> 01:58:13.409]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:15.163 --> 01:58:21.366]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:58:22.047 --> 01:58:27.870]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:58:28.190 --> 01:58:29.551]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:58:29.771 --> 01:58:37.035]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:58:37.295 --> 01:58:41.357]  Potassium iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[01:58:41.717 --> 01:58:44.078]  It works by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:58:44.239 --> 01:58:48.961]  This shields the thyroid and protects it from absorbing the radioactive iodine-131.
[01:58:49.161 --> 01:58:56.065]  There is only one emergency thyroid blocker formulated for babies, children, pets, and adults, and that's Medical Corps Potassium Iodate.
[01:58:56.265 --> 01:58:59.547]  Best of all, unopened bottles can be stored for up to a decade.
[01:58:59.787 --> 01:59:03.209]  Order the official Medical Corps Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:59:05.470 --> 01:59:08.512]  Call toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:59:09.212 --> 01:59:10.672]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:59:10.933 --> 01:59:13.574]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:59:13.694 --> 01:59:22.578]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:22.838 --> 01:59:27.580]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:33.443]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:33.683 --> 01:59:38.207]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:59:38.427 --> 01:59:45.594]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:59:45.614 --> 01:59:50.158]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:59:50.318 --> 01:59:52.841]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:59:53.061 --> 01:59:59.767]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:59:59.987 --> 02:00:05.257]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:05.277 --> 02:00:05.698]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:00:15.279 --> 02:00:19.782]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:00:20.123 --> 02:00:24.226]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:00:24.506 --> 02:00:25.066]  We listened.
[02:00:25.366 --> 02:00:30.350]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:00:30.630 --> 02:00:31.111]  We listened.
[02:00:31.491 --> 02:00:34.533]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:00:34.973 --> 02:00:35.494]  We listened.
[02:00:35.974 --> 02:00:38.456]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping.
[02:00:38.456 --> 02:00:38.936]  I think so.
[02:01:06.598 --> 02:01:17.560]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:20.981]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:25.622 --> 02:01:28.522]  Alright, we're talking to lawyer Jan Furman.
[02:01:30.302 --> 02:01:33.523]  Presented a complaint against General Franks and Lieutenant Colonel
[02:01:34.344 --> 02:01:34.864]  B.P.
[02:01:34.904 --> 02:01:35.584]  McCoy.
[02:01:37.845 --> 02:01:40.946]  And our troops, folks, are being taken over by this system.
[02:01:40.966 --> 02:01:42.006]  They're being brainwashed.
[02:01:42.046 --> 02:01:45.887]  They're shown atrocity films while Metallica plays in the background.
[02:01:46.547 --> 02:01:58.110]  It's been in our newspapers that they have chants about killing children, so it's no surprise the Belgian doctor we had on last week when confronting Marines about killing children, one of them looked at him and contorted his face and said, I love to kill children.
[02:01:59.110 --> 02:01:59.610]  I love it.
[02:02:00.765 --> 02:02:02.666]  They're going to come back here and be police officers.
[02:02:02.706 --> 02:02:08.427]  We have four members of Delta Force from one unit coming back and slaughtering their wives in a week period.
[02:02:10.328 --> 02:02:11.468]  Folks, this is horrible.
[02:02:11.609 --> 02:02:12.969]  We are becoming the bad guys.
[02:02:13.009 --> 02:02:14.529]  But it isn't America that did this.
[02:02:14.630 --> 02:02:20.011]  It's the private banks, the big military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about that's doing this.
[02:02:20.031 --> 02:02:22.132]  I just want to tell you something, Mr. Fuhrman.
[02:02:22.927 --> 02:02:26.289]  I want you to know that here in America, we have more prisons than anybody else.
[02:02:26.309 --> 02:02:27.849]  We're building giant prisons everywhere.
[02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:31.431]  Our police now wear black ski masks, carry submachine guns.
[02:02:31.851 --> 02:02:36.834]  They're raiding people's homes, beating up all women, blasting people's animals, their children.
[02:02:38.095 --> 02:02:43.717]  They are shutting down highways, running giant checkpoints while the border stays wide open.
[02:02:43.757 --> 02:02:46.799]  I just want you to know that America is falling right now.
[02:02:47.359 --> 02:02:49.360]  They're buying up all radio and TV.
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:50.481]  I want you to know it is worse
[02:02:51.644 --> 02:02:52.486]  Well, I know that the U.S.
[02:02:52.506 --> 02:02:53.046]  since September 11
[02:03:05.382 --> 02:03:33.557]  had a lot of problems with uh... basic rights but on the other hand i have to tell you and i think it's also very important for me to see so that uh... when we announced uh... the complaint and when we uh... when some uh... articles uh... were published about it and some uh... uh... television interviews were made that also a lot of americans uh... have sent me emails uh... saying well we think it's it's fine that uh...
[02:03:35.003 --> 02:03:43.187]  The American troops, and especially the command, they should be held accountable for what happened in Iraq.
[02:03:43.307 --> 02:03:50.351]  Well, sir, most Americans... And I think that's a positive aspect of the situation.
[02:03:50.491 --> 02:04:04.678]  Well, yeah, it draws attention to the mass murder, but a lot of Americans, most Americans, conservatives and liberals, are against what's happening, but there's almost a total media shutdown, so we're unable to network, is the problem.
[02:04:06.115 --> 02:04:19.052]  Yes, but still a lot of Americans seem to have had access to the complaint and well, of course I get hostile reactions also, but...
[02:04:20.411 --> 02:04:37.458]  I think there is also, from what I can see, I think there is also a healthy part of the American people, and even of American politicians, who think it's normal that, well, also U.S.
[02:04:37.478 --> 02:04:38.679]  troops should be held accountable.
[02:04:38.719 --> 02:04:45.722]  And that's basically what we are trying to get here, that there is some form of accountability for what happened.
[02:04:45.942 --> 02:04:48.163]  But, sir, this comes from the establishment.
[02:04:48.203 --> 02:04:49.083]  This training
[02:04:49.904 --> 02:04:52.105]  The troops are being turned loose on the people.
[02:04:52.125 --> 02:04:53.045]  I didn't know if you knew that.
[02:04:53.646 --> 02:04:55.666]  We now have troops on our streets in many areas.
[02:04:56.046 --> 02:04:57.567]  This is what the government wants.
[02:04:58.187 --> 02:05:00.628]  So even having Franks held accountable isn't enough.
[02:05:00.728 --> 02:05:07.171]  It should be the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, the President, and those that gave these orders.
[02:05:08.071 --> 02:05:14.934]  Yes, but I think that's a problem which of course cannot be solved from Belgium.
[02:05:15.555 --> 02:05:25.880]  I think what we can try to do is to get an independent inquiry on the way U.S.
[02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:32.904]  commands behaved in this war and then try to get this information back to the American people.
[02:05:33.524 --> 02:05:41.368]  And then we, of course, I hope that some part of the public in the U.S.
[02:05:41.408 --> 02:05:41.768]  at least,
[02:05:43.173 --> 02:05:57.147]  We'll understand that what was told to them about this war being a clean war and being necessary to go after weapons for mass destruction and so on, simply is not the truth.
[02:05:58.962 --> 02:06:06.427]  Well, that's now been proven that that's a fact, and so the neocons, who aren't really conservative, are saying, okay, there isn't weapons of mass destruction, so what?
[02:06:06.828 --> 02:06:12.932]  We've gotten rid of a horrible dictator, a dictator they put into power, a dictator they told to invade Iran and invade Kuwait.
[02:06:12.952 --> 02:06:13.813]  Did you know that our U.S.
[02:06:13.853 --> 02:06:20.397]  Ambassador, April Gillespie, met five days before the invasion of Kuwait with Saddam Hussein and said, go ahead and invade?
[02:06:20.437 --> 02:06:21.278]  Were you aware of that?
[02:06:21.818 --> 02:06:23.620]  Yeah, we knew, of course, that indeed
[02:06:26.019 --> 02:06:45.218]  And we also know that as long as the Iraqi regime was indeed attacking its own people, that, well, not only the US but also some European countries were very strongly in support of the Iraqi regime.
[02:06:46.654 --> 02:07:02.619]  We are aware that the Iraqi regime was placed on the axis of evil, not because it was attacking its own people, because at some time it wanted to, in some way, to get away from
[02:07:03.945 --> 02:07:08.548]  The control of the U.S.
[02:07:08.648 --> 02:07:09.869]  and some European countries.
[02:07:10.049 --> 02:07:11.690]  So yes, I think we are aware of that.
[02:07:11.971 --> 02:07:21.817]  Are you aware of the Project for a New American Century, Bush's think tank, Buchanan and Rumsfeld, authoring a report in 1999 where they said that Saddam wasn't a threat, that he was a pretext to get the oil?
[02:07:22.178 --> 02:07:27.981]  We have a confession written by them that this whole thing was a fraud.
[02:07:28.682 --> 02:07:30.003]  Well, I didn't see this report.
[02:07:30.083 --> 02:07:30.903]  I saw a report
[02:07:32.071 --> 02:07:55.062]  of the RAND Corporation uh... describing I think in 1998 uh... the necessity of the war in uh... in Afghanistan uh... so but uh... I of course uh... can very well believe that indeed uh... this kind of report has been published because I think it's very clear that the
[02:07:57.296 --> 02:08:14.921]  That pretext, for example, for Iraq were used to attack a country which, in fact, was too independent and which didn't want to just hand over its natural resources to the U.S.
[02:08:15.402 --> 02:08:19.643]  Well, the Project for an American Century, this was written by them,
[02:08:20.265 --> 02:08:26.990]  It's sad in the report that they quote needed Pearl Harbor catastrophic events in the U.S.
[02:08:27.010 --> 02:08:29.071]  to get the people behind the war for empire.
[02:08:29.411 --> 02:08:31.072]  You mentioned the Ram Corporation report.
[02:08:31.092 --> 02:08:39.538]  Zbigniew Brzezinski, former National Security Advisor, wrote his own report saying that a string of Pearl Harbor events was needed.
[02:08:39.558 --> 02:08:43.100]  This was written in 98 for the invasion of Afghanistan.
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:43.921]  George Bush had
[02:08:44.905 --> 02:08:56.629]  40,000 US and British troops massed into Tajikistan and Uzbekistan one month before, had a launch order on his desk two days before 9-1-1, and so it's totally staged.
[02:08:57.129 --> 02:09:03.251]  Well, I think we're not... many people in Europe are not naive about this, and they know that
[02:09:04.936 --> 02:09:22.658]  The rhetorics about the war against terrorism and the rhetorics about weapons of mass destruction and that, well, they are just a way to hide the real geopolitical and economical
[02:09:23.786 --> 02:09:25.727]  Well, they're still dying.
[02:09:25.747 --> 02:09:26.428]  Yes, of course.
[02:09:52.763 --> 02:10:20.241]  They have been dying for years under the embargo and of course even today Iraqi people are dying and probably they will do so for tens of years because I, in the meanwhile, got some information about the use of depleted uranium in Iraq and it's also a very serious situation.
[02:10:21.926 --> 02:10:33.611]  Hundreds of tons of depleted uranium have been used and will probably lead to thousands of people suffering, children also suffering from cancer, dying from cancer.
[02:10:33.631 --> 02:10:36.693]  By the way, that's been proven, but I want to warn you though,
[02:10:37.313 --> 02:10:41.055]  The globalists, you know, Rumsfeld now said, OK, we won't buy weapons of mass destruction.
[02:10:41.095 --> 02:10:42.876]  It still was warranted.
[02:10:42.936 --> 02:10:44.777]  By the way, I want to invade Iran.
[02:10:44.817 --> 02:10:47.098]  I want to invade North Korea.
[02:10:47.118 --> 02:10:50.580]  I want to invade Syria and Damascus, their capital.
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:54.502]  And they're about to launch a propaganda war, taking over the radio and TV stations.
[02:10:54.562 --> 02:10:57.524]  And now our news is saying, OK, it's true.
[02:10:57.604 --> 02:10:58.384]  Hundreds of articles.
[02:10:58.744 --> 02:10:59.825]  We are an empire.
[02:10:59.945 --> 02:11:00.965]  It is a new world order.
[02:11:01.206 --> 02:11:02.526]  We're going to take everyone over.
[02:11:02.987 --> 02:11:05.488]  And I hear a lot of people calling in going, yeah!
[02:11:06.188 --> 02:11:10.651]  Yeah, but what Americans don't understand is they're going to be slaves inside this new Reich.
[02:11:10.671 --> 02:11:14.853]  They're going to be slaves inside this new Fourth Reich.
[02:11:15.774 --> 02:11:24.058]  Well, from what I understand, we are trying, of course, to follow up also what happened in the U.S.
[02:11:24.098 --> 02:11:34.384]  And from what I understand is that, for example, the Patriot Act initially targeting foreigners and aliens
[02:11:36.170 --> 02:11:49.902]  From what I understand now, in Patriot 2, the administration will try to extend all the violations of basic rights to Americans themselves.
[02:11:50.282 --> 02:11:54.466]  Okay, Jan Berman is basically like a prosecutor.
[02:11:54.486 --> 02:11:55.807]  He's a lawyer who brought the evidence
[02:11:56.428 --> 02:11:57.990]  Or the indictment of Franks in Belgium.
[02:11:58.030 --> 02:11:59.152]  Let me give you the skinny, sir.
[02:11:59.192 --> 02:12:02.176]  I was the first person to write an analysis of Patriot Act 1.
[02:12:02.296 --> 02:12:03.959]  I've read the entire bill at least five times.
[02:12:04.379 --> 02:12:06.623]  And I've read Patriot Act 2, the House and Senate version.
[02:12:06.663 --> 02:12:08.125]  Let me tell you what Patriot Act 1 did.
[02:12:09.269 --> 02:12:12.493]  Patriot Act 1 is for citizens and non-citizens.
[02:12:12.853 --> 02:12:14.495]  Section 802 of H.R.
[02:12:14.515 --> 02:12:16.697]  3162 of the bill that was passed October 27, 2001.
[02:12:16.837 --> 02:12:19.520]  No one was allowed to read it.
[02:12:19.621 --> 02:12:26.088]  While the Capitol was under Bush and Thrax's attack, the CIA had mailed those to break things down and create hysteria.
[02:12:27.464 --> 02:12:35.888]  Inside that legislation, it says terrorism is redefined as any action that endangers human life that's a violation of any federal or state law.
[02:12:35.908 --> 02:12:39.070]  They've already arrested citizens, they're already holding them at camps.
[02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:41.070]  You're not allowed to know the names of them.
[02:12:41.431 --> 02:12:46.453]  Patriot Act 2 just widens the definition to not even committing a crime or being under suspicion.
[02:12:47.233 --> 02:12:53.977]  Okay, so just so you know, it's already there and they are arresting citizens and states are passing laws mirroring it.
[02:12:54.037 --> 02:12:54.777]  Were you aware of that?
[02:12:56.019 --> 02:13:08.165]  Well, of course we're not aware of all the details, but I can tell you that after the 9-11 attacks and under the influence of the U.S.
[02:13:08.225 --> 02:13:10.587]  and in some cases... One more second.
[02:13:10.607 --> 02:13:11.027]  We've got to move.
[02:13:11.307 --> 02:13:12.888]  Stay right there, Mr. Berman.
[02:13:13.188 --> 02:13:13.648]  Stay right there.
[02:13:13.668 --> 02:13:14.109]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:16.613 --> 02:13:21.116]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:13:21.456 --> 02:13:25.538]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:13:25.839 --> 02:13:26.379]  We listened.
[02:13:26.699 --> 02:13:31.682]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:13:31.962 --> 02:13:32.443]  We listened.
[02:13:32.823 --> 02:13:35.865]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:13:36.285 --> 02:13:36.825]  We listened.
[02:13:37.285 --> 02:13:39.787]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping.
[02:13:39.807 --> 02:13:40.688]  We're good to go.
[02:14:15.648 --> 02:14:18.929]  You are what you eat, and that's why people are turning to nutritional supplements.
[02:14:19.249 --> 02:14:21.830]  The question is, what is the quality of those supplements?
[02:14:22.370 --> 02:14:25.951]  One company, Verified Quality, has actually set the standards in the industry.
[02:14:26.191 --> 02:14:32.032]  In fact, most other supplement companies couldn't even come close to the quality controls that are required by the folks at Verified Quality.
[02:14:32.632 --> 02:14:41.214]  All raw materials that are used to create the Verified Quality products are quarantined, analyzed, tested, and screened for purity, potency, and freshness before they can even be accepted.
[02:14:41.594 --> 02:14:44.095]  That's why the Power Hour chooses Verified Quality.
[02:14:44.295 --> 02:14:46.195]  They're the best in the nutritional business.
[02:14:46.616 --> 02:14:50.296]  When it comes to nutrition, Verified Quality is Verified Quality.
[02:14:50.717 --> 02:14:52.877]  Visit verifiedquality.com or call 1-800-797-3697 for more information.
[02:14:56.958 --> 02:14:59.341]  Take another look at that pill you're about to swallow.
[02:14:59.481 --> 02:15:01.844]  Do you really know how it was made or what's really in it?
[02:15:02.224 --> 02:15:04.507]  Visit verifiedquality.com or call 1-800-797-3697.
[02:15:04.527 --> 02:15:04.747]  That's 1-800-797-3697.
[02:15:04.767 --> 02:15:06.189]  Verified quality is verified quality.
[02:15:15.274 --> 02:15:19.536]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[02:15:19.976 --> 02:15:24.518]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[02:15:24.898 --> 02:15:29.760]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:31.940]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:33.001]  can barely be read.
[02:15:33.281 --> 02:15:34.261]  It has faded that much.
[02:15:34.621 --> 02:15:38.483]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[02:15:38.783 --> 02:15:47.145]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antiqued parchment paper all ready for framing.

[02:16:09.414 --> 02:16:10.174]  The number 800-686-2237.
[02:16:10.294 --> 02:16:19.901]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[02:16:20.181 --> 02:16:22.323]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[02:16:22.703 --> 02:16:27.327]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[02:16:27.647 --> 02:16:28.948]  It actually works.
[02:16:29.386 --> 02:16:32.827]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[02:16:32.847 --> 02:16:34.347]  I've tried many, many products.
[02:16:34.547 --> 02:16:36.668]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenate.
[02:16:37.148 --> 02:16:40.789]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[02:16:41.189 --> 02:16:41.849]  It truly works.
[02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:43.550]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[02:16:43.770 --> 02:16:49.492]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:16:49.552 --> 02:16:55.373]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[02:16:55.493 --> 02:16:58.074]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[02:16:58.414 --> 02:16:59.475]  And it's healthy for you, too.
[02:16:59.655 --> 02:17:00.675]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[02:17:00.695 --> 02:17:00.935]  1-800-622-FIN.
[02:17:00.955 --> 02:17:01.195]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:17:01.215 --> 02:17:02.556]  Get $25 off a 3-month supply of collagenate.
[02:17:02.576 --> 02:17:03.056]  So call now.
[02:17:03.076 --> 02:17:03.216]  1-800-622-FIN.
[02:17:03.256 --> 02:17:03.436]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[02:17:03.456 --> 02:17:07.278]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:17:07.298 --> 02:17:09.239]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:28.570 --> 02:17:31.712]  Those running our government are the enemy combatants.
[02:17:31.792 --> 02:17:34.434]  They are the overthrowers of the Constitution in America.
[02:17:34.574 --> 02:17:35.815]  They are the traitors.
[02:17:36.556 --> 02:17:37.957]  We are the real Americans.
[02:17:38.697 --> 02:17:45.482]  Our final segment, we're about to go to some calls for the lawyer who filed the war crimes complaint against General Franks.
[02:17:46.123 --> 02:17:48.565]  We have these stories posted on Infowars.com.
[02:17:48.605 --> 02:17:50.066]  Lawyer Jan Furman.
[02:17:50.406 --> 02:17:55.310]  You were trying to make a point, sir, about after 9-1-1 with the Patriot Act and we hit that last break.
[02:17:55.330 --> 02:17:55.750]  Go ahead.
[02:17:56.809 --> 02:18:15.537]  Yeah, what I told is that unfortunately also in Europe the same type of legislation and the same type of approach has been accepted by some governments and very often under pressure of the US government.
[02:18:16.557 --> 02:18:24.101]  So we are more or less familiar with this kind of legislation and this kind of approach of the
[02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:39.746]  Of the so-called war on terror, which in fact I think is a very big problem also for all those who are in one way or another trying to fight for a just world.
[02:18:40.227 --> 02:18:47.510]  Yeah, when you try to follow where the terror came from it's always the CIA, Mossad or MI6, but continuing along this line, we'll go to some calls.
[02:18:49.395 --> 02:18:58.141]  When you look at what's happening in these governments, Spain, one of the big allies of this global system, is saying that criticizing any war might be terrorism now.
[02:18:58.161 --> 02:18:59.201]  Might be illegal.
[02:18:59.221 --> 02:18:59.782]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:19:00.742 --> 02:19:06.185]  And other governments, our government's trying to say they may not allow protests now, that might be aiding terrorists.
[02:19:06.606 --> 02:19:08.267]  Oh, you did hear about Spain?
[02:19:08.967 --> 02:19:16.472]  Yeah, we heard about Spain, and Spain is even worse than that, because the Spanish are trying to
[02:19:17.256 --> 02:19:34.990]  proposed during their presidency of the European Union a bill on the European level saying that even protesting, even protests from anti-globalist movements should be considered as terrorism.
[02:19:35.610 --> 02:19:37.091]  And our government backs them on that.
[02:19:37.191 --> 02:19:41.214]  Of course, very far as well in Europe as in the US, I think.
[02:19:41.655 --> 02:19:44.217]  Well, see, that's the opposite of what freedom is supposed to be.
[02:19:45.228 --> 02:19:48.230]  Just like Hitler burned the Reichstag to get control, they've now done it again.
[02:19:48.290 --> 02:19:49.451]  Let's take a call.
[02:19:49.471 --> 02:19:50.532]  I appreciate you joining us, sir.
[02:19:50.892 --> 02:19:52.894]  Let's talk to Jason in California.
[02:19:52.914 --> 02:19:54.335]  Go ahead, Jason.
[02:19:54.355 --> 02:19:54.935]  You're on the air.
[02:19:55.315 --> 02:19:56.656]  Yeah, I just had a question.
[02:19:56.776 --> 02:19:57.597]  Actually, I had two things.
[02:19:58.137 --> 02:20:03.661]  About the Bilderberg conference in Versailles just recently.
[02:20:03.681 --> 02:20:04.342]  In Versailles?
[02:20:04.382 --> 02:20:04.662]  Yeah.
[02:20:04.902 --> 02:20:05.483]  In Versailles?
[02:20:05.503 --> 02:20:05.703]  Yeah.
[02:20:05.903 --> 02:20:06.584]  That's precise.
[02:20:06.604 --> 02:20:07.824]  Sorry.
[02:20:07.864 --> 02:20:09.185]  However you pronounce it, it doesn't matter.
[02:20:09.225 --> 02:20:09.606]  Go ahead.
[02:20:10.026 --> 02:20:12.148]  I was just wondering, who actually attends that meeting?
[02:20:13.112 --> 02:20:13.612]  What is it?
[02:20:13.672 --> 02:20:15.173]  Is it the President or is it...?
[02:20:15.254 --> 02:20:22.018]  The Dutch Roll family, the British Roll family, the Rockefellers, the Crumps, the Vice Presidents, people like that.
[02:20:23.079 --> 02:20:27.242]  Are you aware of the Bilderberg Group meeting that they have, Mr. Fuhrman?
[02:20:28.182 --> 02:20:28.643]  Yes, of course.
[02:20:28.663 --> 02:20:30.644]  There are a lot of meetings like that.
[02:20:31.585 --> 02:20:33.126]  Formal and informal meetings.
[02:20:33.146 --> 02:20:40.631]  There are also a lot of informal meetings between European leaders and US
[02:20:43.399 --> 02:20:46.501]  Either political leaders or business people.
[02:20:48.163 --> 02:21:00.595]  For example, there was a negotiation last year, a secret negotiation on an extradition treaty, which went on for a long time between Europe and the US.
[02:21:01.295 --> 02:21:03.838]  And that was a problem because
[02:21:05.894 --> 02:21:21.026]  The treaty, or at least the discussions were amongst others on the extradition for persons who were, well, searched for on the basis of clearly political activity.
[02:21:23.693 --> 02:21:28.555]  Absolutely, and they call this freedom, and the police wear black uniforms and skull patches.
[02:21:28.575 --> 02:21:31.917]  Do they wear black ski masks in your country, Mr. Fuhrman?
[02:21:32.257 --> 02:21:37.799]  Yes, well, I don't think that there's a lot of difference there between our two countries.
[02:21:37.839 --> 02:21:44.142]  Yes, they also have this special equipment, and they also do this kind of thing, and unfortunately more and more.
[02:21:45.862 --> 02:21:48.744]  Now, I was reading the Russians did that 50 years ago.
[02:21:48.764 --> 02:21:49.464]  I wonder why our
[02:21:50.111 --> 02:21:51.491]  Police recovering their identities.
[02:21:51.511 --> 02:21:53.492]  That's never a good sign for a free society.
[02:21:54.192 --> 02:21:54.892]  Well, that's true.
[02:21:55.192 --> 02:22:10.316]  Indeed, it was also an old tradition, at least in my country, that the police had to be... that you need to have the possibility to identify a police officer, because that's, of course, essential
[02:22:11.693 --> 02:22:14.295]  Uh... to get any form of accountability.
[02:22:14.795 --> 02:22:20.578]  If you can't identify the policeman, then well, there's no form of accountability whatsoever possible.
[02:22:20.598 --> 02:22:25.460]  Have you heard the former KGB chief is going to run our new internal passport system?
[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:26.280]  Did you hear about that?
[02:22:26.721 --> 02:22:27.781]  No, I didn't hear about that.
[02:22:27.921 --> 02:22:31.283]  Does that concern you to have the former head of the KGB running things over here?
[02:22:32.703 --> 02:22:36.725]  Well, I don't know if uh... I should be worried about that because uh...
[02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:47.574]  You know, it's my feeling that a former chief of CIA would be as bad as a former chief of KGB.
[02:22:47.594 --> 02:22:51.276]  Well, we got a president who's the son of one, and then they got their little KGB buddy, exactly.
[02:22:52.557 --> 02:22:56.379]  Mr. Furman, I really appreciate you joining us, and I hope this goes well.
[02:22:56.399 --> 02:22:58.520]  I hope they don't throw it out, and I really appreciate you joining us.
[02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:00.040]  Okay, thank you.
[02:23:00.300 --> 02:23:01.161]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:01.661 --> 02:23:03.082]  I'll be right back with more calls, more news.
[02:23:04.582 --> 02:23:05.483]  We're on the march.
[02:23:05.983 --> 02:23:07.484]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:08.505 --> 02:23:11.326]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:14.867 --> 02:23:17.887]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:23:18.207 --> 02:23:23.128]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:23:23.388 --> 02:23:26.009]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate.
[02:23:26.029 --> 02:23:26.109]  888-803-4438.
[02:23:26.129 --> 02:23:27.089]  Call now and get free shipping.
[02:23:27.129 --> 02:23:27.589]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:23:59.887 --> 02:24:03.749]  Alright folks, I'm going to go back to some calls at 800-259-9231.
[02:24:05.449 --> 02:24:06.850]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:24:07.870 --> 02:24:12.231]  Then I'm going to jump back into a bunch of the news we have not yet gotten to that is very important, so stay with us.
[02:24:13.111 --> 02:24:14.692]  Is it Dan or Don in Michigan, Mark?
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:17.961]  Dawn in Michigan.
[02:24:17.981 --> 02:24:18.561]  You're on the air.
[02:24:18.662 --> 02:24:19.242]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:24:19.282 --> 02:24:20.703]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[02:24:20.803 --> 02:24:21.524]  Fine, my friend.
[02:24:21.924 --> 02:24:22.125]  Good.
[02:24:22.145 --> 02:24:27.169]  I haven't talked to you in a few months, but I was having trouble getting that Northwoods document off the internet.
[02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:30.172]  I finally got it about four or five days ago.
[02:24:30.192 --> 02:24:31.713]  Whether you mind helping me out?
[02:24:32.074 --> 02:24:33.335]  I've been showing that to everybody.
[02:24:33.655 --> 02:24:34.356]  Just everybody.
[02:24:34.776 --> 02:24:38.860]  I've been printing documents, everything you have in your films, you know, to support
[02:24:40.782 --> 02:24:47.304]  The government's involvement and running of the whole thing, and I... For those that don't know, you know what you're talking about, but others don't.
[02:24:47.384 --> 02:24:52.685]  Tell them what Northwoods is, tell them what the document covers, who wrote it, what it does.
[02:24:53.245 --> 02:24:58.567]  Well, it was a memorandum to the Secretary of Defense by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:24:59.607 --> 02:24:59.787]  L.L.
[02:24:59.807 --> 02:25:01.948]  Lemitzer was the general at the time in 1962 who
[02:25:03.672 --> 02:25:09.560]  Came up with a plan on blowing up American airliners, bombing Washington, sinking U.S.
[02:25:09.620 --> 02:25:17.291]  ships, just like they did to Maine way back when, all as a pretext, as a justification for military intervention in Cuba.
[02:25:17.828 --> 02:25:19.409]  Yeah, and we're not for Cuba, folks.
[02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:21.791]  The point is, is that you don't become Fidel to fight Fidel.
[02:25:22.332 --> 02:25:24.713]  And this got green-lighted all the way up to Kennedy, who said no.
[02:25:24.793 --> 02:25:27.836]  And it also called for sniper attacks in D.C.
[02:25:27.876 --> 02:25:28.436]  and Miami.
[02:25:28.716 --> 02:25:29.997]  How to frame Patsy's.
[02:25:30.538 --> 02:25:31.959]  How to blow up ships full of U.S.
[02:25:31.999 --> 02:25:32.940]  troops to blame it on enemies.
[02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:34.121]  How to attack U.S.
[02:25:34.181 --> 02:25:36.222]  bases with army dressed up like foreigners.
[02:25:36.723 --> 02:25:43.608]  Same thing the Germans did when they attacked one of their radio stations on the Polish border to blame it on the Poles with Nazis dressed up like Poles.
[02:25:44.910 --> 02:25:48.313]  Hijacking jet airliners by remote control full of college students.
[02:25:48.373 --> 02:25:51.817]  It said killing students would work extra good because people care about kids.
[02:25:52.518 --> 02:25:56.361]  It actually read, a helpful wave of casualty lists in U.S.
[02:25:56.401 --> 02:26:00.725]  newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation was the exact words, actually.
[02:26:00.866 --> 02:26:04.589]  Yeah, and Northwoods is about a minute of my 170 minute film.
[02:26:05.090 --> 02:26:09.374]  Every minute is hardcore documentation just like that.
[02:26:10.382 --> 02:26:13.925]  I just wanted to tell you about... 170 points, go ahead.
[02:26:14.065 --> 02:26:16.827]  That one thing about Northwoods, because that was bugging me for months now.
[02:26:17.768 --> 02:26:27.175]  No, to answer your question before you've asked it yet, I haven't got the city to pass the resolution yet, the Liberty Preservation Resolution, but I did speak with the mayor the other day at the Memorial Day Parade.
[02:26:28.414 --> 02:26:30.055]  I wanted to touch base with Terrania there.
[02:26:30.075 --> 02:26:41.185]  For those who don't know what the Liberty Resolution is, some cities have passed mine or parts of it, hundreds of others have passed other resolutions reaffirming the Bill of Rights and saying, no, you can't arrest citizens secretly and blow their heads off.
[02:26:41.886 --> 02:26:43.147]  Two last things I have, Alex.
[02:26:43.988 --> 02:26:50.414]  One thing that really ticks me off, and it's just, I mean, not just the horns and the hockey masks and the Miami SWAT teams,
[02:26:50.908 --> 02:26:56.713]  Who are these clowns who had t-shirts on or uniforms on to say, somebody gonna die?
[02:26:56.953 --> 02:26:57.554]  Who are these guys?
[02:26:58.034 --> 02:27:04.520]  Well, an article written by one of our writers, who's a retired army officer himself, has seen it.
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:06.381]  I've seen it on Inside the LAPD.
[02:27:06.882 --> 02:27:08.563]  I've seen him wearing the stuff in Austin.
[02:27:08.983 --> 02:27:10.284]  Somebody gonna die?
[02:27:10.304 --> 02:27:15.849]  You know, just all sorts of threatening t-shirts about killing.
[02:27:16.330 --> 02:27:18.932]  And then it was in the newspaper in Eugene, Oregon,
[02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:22.051]  I haven't killed anybody in two weeks, two and a half weeks.
[02:27:22.071 --> 02:27:22.931]  And kitchen timers.
[02:27:37.635 --> 02:27:38.736]  And a kitchen timer.
[02:27:39.216 --> 02:27:40.817]  And this is the new America.
[02:27:41.077 --> 02:27:51.302]  When they went in the house and killed the two people's dogs and shot the other one as it jumped out the window, running from them, they went ahead and arrested the guy with a $3,000 fine for having a parking ticket.
[02:27:51.362 --> 02:27:52.463]  This is mainstream news.
[02:27:52.883 --> 02:28:05.309]  So now when they come and kill you or harass you or drag, oh, in Eugene they drug the naked blonde out, you know, 30-year-old woman, real good looking, drug her naked out of bed, laughing at her for hours out there naked in the street.
[02:28:06.210 --> 02:28:10.834]  Uh, stalking around, and the National Guard was there, of course, all part of the freedom.
[02:28:11.755 --> 02:28:18.882]  Um, did you know that, um, I just stuck this in, um, David Shippers' daughter lives here in Cadillac, Michigan, believe it or not?
[02:28:19.503 --> 02:28:20.003]  Coincidence?
[02:28:20.284 --> 02:28:26.570]  Well, for those that don't know, David Shippers, of course, the guy that impeached Bill Clinton, says the government had prior knowledge, he tried to warn him, they wouldn't help him.
[02:28:26.590 --> 02:28:29.433]  Uh, we've interviewed him for the road to tyranny, but, uh,
[02:28:30.541 --> 02:28:30.962]  I didn't know.
[02:28:30.982 --> 02:28:32.564]  I didn't know David Shipper's daughter was kind of like Michelle.
[02:28:32.584 --> 02:28:33.245]  Yeah, it's pretty wild.
[02:28:33.666 --> 02:28:39.274]  And there's, you know, the border guy, the park ranger who was murdered last year in Arizona?
[02:28:39.334 --> 02:28:40.516]  Yeah, his family lives there.
[02:28:40.676 --> 02:28:44.661]  Yeah, they're doing a lot of work trying to get border security to beef it up.
[02:28:45.242 --> 02:28:46.344]  Last thing I had, Alex Jones.
[02:28:48.021 --> 02:28:51.225]  Did you know the people that download music and stuff off these music shares?
[02:28:51.245 --> 02:28:54.490]  Yeah, you will be considered a terrorist, life in prison, or secret execution.
[02:28:54.690 --> 02:28:55.691]  I heard a little bit about that.
[02:28:55.971 --> 02:29:06.065]  I was looking around for some Patriot stuff, or somebody with some good stuff, and I just found your... That Oregon law, and this is federal what you just mentioned, but the Oregon law that they're trying to pass, everyone wants to pass it.
[02:29:06.685 --> 02:29:11.007]  Uh, the bill that gives you life in prison if one person in a protest blocks traffic, everyone gets life in prison.
[02:29:11.027 --> 02:29:12.207]  It says it word for word.
[02:29:12.487 --> 02:29:23.231]  It also lists owning guns, uh, it lists, uh, it lists a tier to tier music transfers, life in prison, 25 years of it in a forced labor camp.
[02:29:23.251 --> 02:29:24.372]  It actually says it.
[02:29:24.772 --> 02:29:25.312]  It's crazy.
[02:29:25.812 --> 02:29:26.753]  Oh no, it's freedom.
[02:29:27.073 --> 02:29:29.874]  Life in prison for transferring music, it's freedom.
[02:29:29.894 --> 02:29:35.616]  I just wanted you to know, I don't know how you felt about it or not, but, uh, I found your road to tyranny on there and, uh,
[02:29:36.078 --> 02:29:37.659]  By golly, I've got the whole thing now.
[02:29:38.019 --> 02:29:38.759]  I've got videos.
[02:29:38.799 --> 02:29:40.080]  I've been passing them out like crazy.
[02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:42.441]  And I've met people... You found them over in the tyranny where?
[02:29:42.461 --> 02:29:43.001]  Off Kazaa.
[02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:47.163]  Oh, you're talking off of one of the download sites.
[02:29:47.243 --> 02:29:47.984]  Yeah, Kazaa.
[02:29:48.284 --> 02:29:50.385]  Yeah, about 50 people have posted it.
[02:29:50.885 --> 02:29:52.086]  More folks should post it.
[02:29:52.126 --> 02:29:53.646]  It's been viewed by millions of people.
[02:29:53.707 --> 02:29:54.907]  That's awesome, Alex.
[02:29:55.427 --> 02:29:58.049]  Yeah, well, I think you want to order the original and make copies of it.
[02:29:58.209 --> 02:29:58.529]  I will.
[02:29:58.769 --> 02:29:59.109]  I will.
[02:29:59.269 --> 02:30:00.630]  Making copies of some internet video.
[02:30:01.611 --> 02:30:06.035]  I don't have a burner, a DVD burner, but anyways... No, you just buy VHS tape from me and you make copies of it.
[02:30:06.335 --> 02:30:07.036]  I'm going to, Alex.
[02:30:07.496 --> 02:30:08.597]  All right, appreciate the call, sir.
[02:30:08.617 --> 02:30:09.378]  God bless you, buddy.
[02:30:09.578 --> 02:30:10.519]  You bet, good to hear from you.
[02:30:10.579 --> 02:30:11.800]  Ryan in New Jersey.
[02:30:11.900 --> 02:30:12.841]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[02:30:12.901 --> 02:30:13.342]  Go ahead.
[02:30:13.642 --> 02:30:14.283]  Yeah, hello, Alex.
[02:30:14.503 --> 02:30:14.903]  How are you?
[02:30:15.103 --> 02:30:15.704]  Fantastic.
[02:30:16.084 --> 02:30:17.726]  I'm just calling to see if you knew.
[02:30:17.806 --> 02:30:24.032]  I'm pretty sure you might have known, but for anyone who listens to your show, there's something very positive that's coming out within
[02:30:24.753 --> 02:30:25.854]  About 23 days.
[02:30:26.694 --> 02:30:27.655]  Today will be 23 days.
[02:30:27.715 --> 02:30:30.577]  There's going to be an ad that's going to be running in 12 major newspapers.
[02:30:31.418 --> 02:30:38.843]  And this ad is basically being ran by FromTheWilderness.com, which is a website that does very similar to what you do.
[02:30:38.903 --> 02:30:39.744]  Yeah, I know who it is.
[02:30:40.044 --> 02:30:40.504]  Oh, okay.
[02:30:40.524 --> 02:30:42.906]  So you probably know about what I'm talking about then.
[02:30:43.947 --> 02:30:45.628]  That's a great thing.
[02:30:45.668 --> 02:30:47.189]  So far, I was looking at the website this morning.
[02:30:47.849 --> 02:30:49.991]  Uh, they need 100,000 to raise.
[02:30:50.131 --> 02:30:52.213]  I don't support that organization.
[02:30:52.233 --> 02:30:53.595]  I'm not going to say anything about it.
[02:30:53.695 --> 02:30:54.696]  I'm just not going to talk about it.
[02:30:55.096 --> 02:30:55.416]  Okay.
[02:30:56.197 --> 02:30:57.498]  Okay.
[02:30:57.558 --> 02:30:59.180]  I don't mind considering talking about people.
[02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:00.982]  I just don't support it.
[02:31:01.002 --> 02:31:02.203]  Not on my show.
[02:31:02.839 --> 02:31:03.159]  Oh, okay.
[02:31:03.219 --> 02:31:08.623]  No, I just wanted, you know, to let people know, you know, if, uh... Yeah, no, mm-mm.
[02:31:08.843 --> 02:31:10.304]  Uh, anything else on your mind, Ryan?
[02:31:10.324 --> 02:31:15.047]  Uh, well, no, just keep up the good work, and I hope you know that we're doing... I'm doing everything I can to help you out.
[02:31:15.407 --> 02:31:18.449]  Well, I... Well, it's helping yourself out fighting this new world order, Ryan.
[02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:23.152]  What do you think about, uh, our government admitting that there's no weapons of mass destruction, but so what?
[02:31:23.192 --> 02:31:24.853]  It's... They're gonna invade more countries.
[02:31:25.153 --> 02:31:28.095]  Well, you know, it didn't surprise me at all, to be honest with you.
[02:31:28.115 --> 02:31:29.336]  I was kind of expecting
[02:31:29.989 --> 02:31:32.670]  Well, a lot of people are waking up, and I appreciate the call, Ryan.
[02:31:55.521 --> 02:32:00.103]  I get three types of calls on this show from people that have gotten my films or got other information out.
[02:32:00.223 --> 02:32:07.765]  Either 100% are waking up, 90% are waking up, you've heard the calls yourself, or 10% are waking up.
[02:32:08.065 --> 02:32:13.867]  And it really seems to be New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio is just almost totally brain dead.
[02:32:15.068 --> 02:32:16.388]  But there are some waking up there.
[02:32:16.408 --> 02:32:23.831]  But if somebody doesn't want to hear the truth, wants to be a slave, wants their pension funds taken, wants liberty totally annihilated, then let them have it!
[02:32:24.843 --> 02:32:26.824]  By the way, they're not going to be safe going along with it.
[02:32:27.204 --> 02:32:29.085]  The globalists just feed indiscriminately.
[02:32:29.105 --> 02:32:31.005]  Because the whole thing is run out of ignorance.
[02:32:31.025 --> 02:32:34.446]  This pyramidal structure of power is run out of compartmentalization.
[02:32:34.707 --> 02:32:36.407]  And they feed on anybody and everybody.
[02:32:37.448 --> 02:32:39.848]  I found they feed on their own servants more often than they do on us.
[02:32:40.509 --> 02:32:43.210]  Because their own mindless servants are easier targets.
[02:32:44.130 --> 02:32:44.430]  Okay?
[02:32:45.206 --> 02:32:51.331]  So, and you know, I don't get into bashing other people on this show, and they can bash me all they want.
[02:32:51.811 --> 02:32:53.052]  I'm just not going to get into it.
[02:32:53.072 --> 02:33:05.081]  I'm going to unify the country, move forward, and promote those that promote the reality of what the New World Order is, not from a left-wing or a right-wing perspective, but from a constitutionalist perspective.
[02:33:05.961 --> 02:33:13.207]  The Christian values, the real Christian values, not the neocon, you know, Pat Robertson forced abortion is good,
[02:33:14.819 --> 02:33:15.440]  In China.
[02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:17.163]  No, I don't agree with that type of conservatism.
[02:33:17.203 --> 02:33:18.745]  If that's conservative, I ain't conservative.
[02:33:18.946 --> 02:33:22.972]  But there's very few people that I'll talk about on the air.
[02:33:22.992 --> 02:33:25.936]  I'll talk about a few of them, but I'm not going to get into it on other people.
[02:33:26.757 --> 02:33:27.979]  It's just not going to happen here.
[02:33:29.181 --> 02:33:30.283]  Not going to happen on this show.
[02:33:31.654 --> 02:33:34.696]  So, more calls coming up in a few seconds.
[02:33:34.816 --> 02:33:37.998]  I want to cover some more news now.
[02:33:38.058 --> 02:33:41.280]  The toll-free number to join me on-air is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:41.340]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:43.601]  And I will get you up and on the air, my friends.
[02:33:57.848 --> 02:34:12.818]  Some of the news items that I want to go into that are coming up concerns the operation eradication of what's really going on in Iraq.
[02:34:13.699 --> 02:34:19.783]  Also, Wolfowitz, the Deputy Defense Secretary, reveals Iraq PR plan and admits that they don't need any weapons of mass destruction.
[02:34:20.184 --> 02:34:23.626]  Some good news, Philadelphia Council condemns Patriot Act.
[02:34:24.941 --> 02:34:28.183]  Link says they can't discuss POW rescue.
[02:34:28.243 --> 02:34:31.765]  Now she can't discuss how that was totally fake to the news.
[02:34:31.845 --> 02:34:33.105]  It's national security.
[02:34:34.446 --> 02:34:46.612]  On our Yahoo group at InfoWars.com, we have posted the 9-1-1 Commission testimony, National Commission on September 11th Terror Attacks, remarks on NORAD personnel by Major General Craig McKinley,
[02:34:47.578 --> 02:34:50.299]  It's 35 pages long, but you should go scan through it.
[02:34:50.939 --> 02:34:53.580]  India test fires medium-range missile.
[02:34:54.300 --> 02:34:59.102]  Ottawa ready to discuss missile shield with the U.S., merging that Pan-American Union defense forces.
[02:35:00.423 --> 02:35:02.283]  Feds catch illegals and let them go.
[02:35:02.423 --> 02:35:06.144]  Lack of federal agents allows aliens off the hook to spot high-terror threat.
[02:35:06.825 --> 02:35:08.045]  That's not true, folks.
[02:35:10.866 --> 02:35:12.887]  They can have one guy to deport, and they won't do it.
[02:35:12.927 --> 02:35:16.228]  They only do it in little staged events for the media.
[02:35:18.116 --> 02:35:22.320]  Also, a secretive convention of police raises questions.
[02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:27.184]  Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the police meeting secretly with the CIA and others.
[02:35:27.945 --> 02:35:28.906]  See, that's what's happening.
[02:35:29.686 --> 02:35:31.628]  Also, a radar gun for everyone.
[02:35:31.668 --> 02:35:35.652]  They're now getting a set of the Tattletail Mode for the National Seatbelt Initiative.
[02:35:36.552 --> 02:35:43.819]  Now it's radar guns they want to use to get you into the Tattletail Mode, the secret police mode, for internal checkpoints.
[02:35:45.274 --> 02:35:55.476]  Also, you may have heard that top TV people, top government officials, members of Parliament have been caught in a child kidnapping pedophilia ring.
[02:35:55.496 --> 02:35:59.937]  A lot of this came out because some of the deaths of the children, children being found dead.
[02:35:59.957 --> 02:36:01.597]  It's happened in many countries of Europe.
[02:36:02.657 --> 02:36:05.978]  The investigations have been killed, even when they find the poor dead babies.
[02:36:07.158 --> 02:36:10.479]  Babies in many cases, but now it's an article out of the mainstream
[02:36:11.509 --> 02:36:37.596]  front-page news out of Portugal's weekly newspaper in English and Marusso bombed off to Bilderberg meeting and it turns out that you have this Mr. Rodriguez is currently fighting off a pedophile scandal following the arrest of Social Socialist Member of Parliament Pablo Pedestro and claims in some newspapers that the leader was also has been accused of
[02:36:38.348 --> 02:36:39.289]  We're good to go.
[02:36:57.333 --> 02:37:00.996]  Also, a shot peace activist may not recover, says Mother London Telegraph.
[02:37:01.396 --> 02:37:08.582]  Peace activist shot by an Israeli soldier, was flown back to Britain yesterday, still in a coma, from which he is unlikely to recover.
[02:37:09.122 --> 02:37:18.349]  Tom Herndahl, 22, was left brain damaged when he was shot in the head while protecting children in the Gaza Strip last month.
[02:37:18.910 --> 02:37:25.335]  Photojournalism student flew back to Heathrow with his parents, who were conducting their own inquiry into the incident.
[02:37:26.477 --> 02:37:31.820]  He has been transferred to the intensive care unit of the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, North London.
[02:37:32.900 --> 02:37:45.946]  We've got the Israelis shooting British Reuters reporters, AP reporters in the head, running over a Michigan State freshman with an armored bulldozer, and then backing back over, killing her.
[02:37:46.987 --> 02:37:47.607]  We've got them.
[02:37:47.627 --> 02:37:53.270]  Then when the parents come to the memorial service, the Israeli troops shoot at them, publicly laughing.
[02:37:53.931 --> 02:37:57.652]  You go, oh, we'll support Israel because the neocon phony Christians say so.
[02:37:58.152 --> 02:38:08.216]  If the Antichrist was running Israel, a guy with red horns was running Israel, would you say, oh, worship the Antichrist, we'll set his temple up there because he says so?
[02:38:09.696 --> 02:38:11.517]  This is a real, this is really sick, folks.
[02:38:12.037 --> 02:38:15.278]  We've had Jewish writers on who'll tell you Israel's controlled by the globalists.
[02:38:16.673 --> 02:38:18.213]  And that's all that's happening here.
[02:38:18.253 --> 02:38:19.294]  It's totally staged.
[02:38:19.314 --> 02:38:25.135]  And Israel founded Hamas to continue the destabilization to push all this control.
[02:38:25.155 --> 02:38:28.776]  So that's what we're dealing with there.
[02:38:29.336 --> 02:38:45.980]  Before I get back into the news and then some of your calls and some more of the news, I do want to take just a couple minutes out to tell the listeners that this broadcast, what I do, is fully supported and funded by your purchase of my videos.
[02:38:47.026 --> 02:38:54.051]  I know we have such an honest audience that I authorize you and encourage you to make copies of my films for non-profit educational, not-for-sale purposes.
[02:38:55.352 --> 02:38:56.873]  And I have produced nine of them.
[02:38:57.393 --> 02:39:00.655]  I've also written the book, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:39:02.056 --> 02:39:02.757]  It is only $12.
[02:39:07.118 --> 02:39:08.399]  230 pages long, as I said.
[02:39:08.980 --> 02:39:10.581]  The films are all over two hours.
[02:39:10.641 --> 02:39:19.928]  My ninth film is Police State 3, Total Enslavement, where I don't focus on 9-1-1, like I do with 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, and Part 2 of That Man Who's a Terror.
[02:39:20.429 --> 02:39:35.801]  I focus mainly in this film on dozens of other confirmed, admitted examples of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide to get people to accept tyranny in a police state, and as a pretext for more control.
[02:39:36.750 --> 02:39:39.152]  I cover Patriot Act 1 and 2 in great detail.
[02:39:39.772 --> 02:39:41.333]  I get into Homeland Security.
[02:39:42.594 --> 02:39:44.655]  I get into the Total Information Awareness Network.
[02:39:44.675 --> 02:39:56.702]  I get into the white slavery, government-run pedophile rings and trafficking from Israel to Germany to France to Belgium to the United States and DynCorp, convicted of this, the U.N.
[02:39:56.722 --> 02:39:57.923]  The U.N.
[02:39:57.943 --> 02:39:59.024]  and DynCorp together on that.
[02:39:59.684 --> 02:40:00.945]  It's all in the film.
[02:40:01.105 --> 02:40:04.307]  Two hours, 37 minutes, a tour de force.
[02:40:04.487 --> 02:40:06.068]  I suggest you watch it in three parts.
[02:40:06.852 --> 02:40:09.515]  It's really about five different segments, five different films.

[02:41:37.162 --> 02:41:44.546]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:44.826 --> 02:41:49.569]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:49.789 --> 02:41:55.432]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.672 --> 02:42:00.196]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:42:00.416 --> 02:42:07.582]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:42:07.602 --> 02:42:12.005]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:42:12.305 --> 02:42:14.806]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[02:42:15.026 --> 02:42:21.789]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:42:55.035 --> 02:42:58.157]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:42:58.417 --> 02:43:04.159]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:43:04.459 --> 02:43:10.601]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:43:10.961 --> 02:43:14.862]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.

[02:45:00.134 --> 02:45:00.675]  We're here.
[02:45:00.795 --> 02:45:01.616]  We tell the truth.
[02:45:01.656 --> 02:45:03.138]  We don't get involved in infighting.
[02:45:03.579 --> 02:45:06.323]  We don't get involved in mindless garbage or conspiracy theories.
[02:45:06.744 --> 02:45:12.172]  We analyze the globalists, their own policy reports, what they're doing, expose the left-right paradigm.
[02:45:13.382 --> 02:45:19.606]  Because if you only expose one side of their system, one rail that this train rolls on, you only help the globalists.
[02:45:20.067 --> 02:45:24.290]  Gold reaches 15-week high as dollar slips financial times.
[02:45:24.750 --> 02:45:30.414]  Gold reveled in the misfortune of the dollar yesterday, reaching $374.40 per troy ounce.
[02:45:30.854 --> 02:45:31.995]  It's highest in 15 weeks.
[02:45:32.015 --> 02:45:35.858]  The precious metal has benefited from its inverse relationship
[02:45:36.593 --> 02:45:41.537]  With the dollar, his appreciation has sent prices up by $55 since the start of April.
[02:45:41.897 --> 02:45:50.963]  Some analysts believe gold is set to rise further, driven not by the dollar's weakness, but by demand from Asia following a plan by Chinese government to allow individuals to trade gold.
[02:45:51.504 --> 02:45:55.246]  Gold is coming to its own, and we are trying to see it going up faster this time.
[02:45:56.427 --> 02:46:04.553]  When it was $3.20, it was a buying opportunity, but now demand is coming from Asia, said Ian Williams at DerLauncher.
[02:46:05.823 --> 02:46:06.943]  And it goes on and on.
[02:46:07.003 --> 02:46:14.925]  There will be a massive increase in demand as China is allowing its citizens to invest in gold as a means of recycling the trade surplus, keeping upward pressure off their currency.
[02:46:15.165 --> 02:46:18.945]  So what happens is they're dumping fiat dollars and buying gold!
[02:46:19.646 --> 02:46:22.006]  The commies tell their people to do it, but not here!
[02:46:22.706 --> 02:46:23.566]  Oh, it's bad.
[02:46:23.646 --> 02:46:25.527]  It's don't, don't, don't, don't buy gold.
[02:46:27.367 --> 02:46:29.667]  You ought to be in gold 5% or something.
[02:46:29.707 --> 02:46:30.408]  I know I am.
[02:46:30.468 --> 02:46:31.708]  I mean, you're just nuts if you don't.
[02:46:31.768 --> 02:46:32.388]  I'm in gold about 20%.
[02:46:34.836 --> 02:46:38.101]  It goes on and on and on with this vital news.
[02:46:39.372 --> 02:46:43.494]  And, uh, you know, the Shiites and the Shias were all for America, but here it is now.
[02:46:43.574 --> 02:46:45.515]  Iraq Shiites protest at alleged U.S.
[02:46:45.575 --> 02:46:46.015]  arrest.
[02:46:46.455 --> 02:46:53.378]  Reuters, more than 500 Shiite Muslims marched in Baghdad Thursday to protest against the alleged arrest of several of their clerics by U.S.
[02:46:53.418 --> 02:46:53.838]  forces.
[02:46:53.898 --> 02:46:54.938]  No comment was available.
[02:46:55.378 --> 02:46:55.679]  The U.S.
[02:46:55.699 --> 02:47:05.463]  military and whatever they had made any arrests, some of the protesters distributed a leaflet from the previously unknown military wing of al-Hawwaz, a powerful Shiite religious seminary.
[02:47:06.503 --> 02:47:08.884]  And, of course, Operation Iraq, eradication,
[02:47:09.781 --> 02:47:17.145]  We warned the Bush administration that invading Iraq would destabilize the Middle East and spread radical anti-American Islam, which is what they wanted to do to further escalate the war.
[02:47:18.265 --> 02:47:27.350]  Told the American people that taking out Saddam Hussein would allow a viable government, replace him, would open a vacuum for anarchy, which they had before Saddam came in, before the CIA put him in the first time.
[02:47:27.930 --> 02:47:31.432]  Civil war and a power grab by radical Iranian-backed Shiite clerics.
[02:47:32.026 --> 02:47:39.308]  Now the anti-war movement's doomsday scenarios have been fulfilled so completely that military history sources scarcely mention a more thoroughly botched endeavor.
[02:47:39.808 --> 02:47:41.848]  We will be living with a fallout for years.
[02:47:42.289 --> 02:47:42.949]  More on that.
[02:47:44.329 --> 02:47:47.310]  Wolfowitz reveals Iraq PR plan.
[02:47:47.710 --> 02:47:49.910]  There has been a very candid statement by the U.S.
[02:47:49.950 --> 02:47:51.451]  Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz.
[02:47:51.471 --> 02:47:51.831]  The U.S.
[02:47:51.851 --> 02:48:00.153]  decision to stress the dangers posed by Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction, above all other reasons, was taken because of disputes within the Washington bureaucracy.
[02:48:02.367 --> 02:48:05.569]  And now he says that no weapons of mass destruction need be found.
[02:48:05.949 --> 02:48:07.010]  That's not why they went in.
[02:48:07.050 --> 02:48:08.371]  Really, I thought you said it a hundred times.
[02:48:08.431 --> 02:48:08.791]  It was.
[02:48:09.191 --> 02:48:09.952]  Again, good news.
[02:48:10.012 --> 02:48:11.813]  Philadelphia Council condemns Patriot Act.
[02:48:12.374 --> 02:48:14.435]  Reuters, Philadelphia on Thursday became the largest U.S.
[02:48:14.455 --> 02:48:15.536]  city to date to condemn the U.S.
[02:48:15.576 --> 02:48:18.037]  Patriot Act as a threat to the constitutional rights of citizens.
[02:48:18.758 --> 02:48:20.779]  And yes, it does affect citizens.
[02:48:22.265 --> 02:48:27.268]  I'm out of time for all the news you didn't have a chance to hear us cover in the first couple hours or any news we didn't get to.
