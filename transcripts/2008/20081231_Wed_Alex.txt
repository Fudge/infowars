[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:00.489]  We're good to go.
[00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:33.362]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:35.303]  It is the 31st day of December 2008.
[00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:48.854]  We're live the next hour and 51 minutes at PrisonPlanet.tv and we generally go live in the second two hours of this syndicated radio transmission and again we're going to
[00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:53.778]  Be live here for the balance of the show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:54.098 --> 00:00:55.039]  Wide open phones.
[00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:05.808]  Previously we were taking phone calls from folks about what their predictions for 2009 are, how bad they think the controlled economic implosion by the private central banks will be.
[00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:32.806]  Their take on the fact that 2008 was the year where hundreds of mainstream news publications from the Financial Times of London to the Wall Street Journal admitted that a secret world government has been built by the private banks, and that it is tyrannical, but that that is for our own good, and that they have orchestrated the crisis and will now take over the planet, control the issuance of currencies, and that we will buy carbon credit taxes from them.
[00:01:33.806 --> 00:01:38.027]  That has all been announced in over 200 publications in the last few months that I have seen.
[00:01:38.788 --> 00:01:41.889]  Just unbelievable arrogance on the establishment's part.
[00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.890]  Also, Neocon Bolton says Gaza conflict may result in U.S.
[00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.790]  attack on Iran.
[00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.911]  We're going to play that clip later in the hour.
[00:01:49.651 --> 00:02:10.135]  uh... and uh... some of the other developments the military is now responding to the public saying don't worry troops are going to be on the streets but it's for your own good we've got the head of north com uh... the military dictatorship over the u s in the military publicly works for foreign banks now they're there to make sure the receivership the hostile corporate takeover the hijacking of the nation is done smoothly
[00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:14.626]  So military backpedals on troops in America.
[00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:15.486]  We're going to get to that as well.
[00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:18.086]  But as promised, I want to take a lot of calls today.
[00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:28.588]  If you're watching live at PrisonPlanet.tv or on our AM and FM affiliates, or shortwave, or satellite, or internet out there on the internet streams, I do want to plug a few new things first.
[00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:36.830]  I noticed a InfoWars Twitter account that a fan created, and we appreciate that, that had a few thousand people on it.
[00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.051]  And I thought, yeah, we need a Twitter account.
[00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:40.131]  So we started one Saturday.
[00:02:41.032 --> 00:02:43.013]  It's got a few hundred people subscribing to it.
[00:02:43.353 --> 00:03:00.018]  If you go to InfoWars.com, click on the Listen page, you will see that there is a place to subscribe for free to the InfoWars Twitter account that will send you our top headlines every day, 20 or 30 of them, to your cell phone so you get live updates as our articles come out.
[00:03:01.238 --> 00:03:02.038]  I mean, that's great info.
[00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:03.379]  I'm thinking about subscribing to it.
[00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:08.007]  Because everything is going, you know, for your house, PC is basically your cell phone.
[00:03:08.648 --> 00:03:11.309]  And then you use it, you know, as a little handheld computer.
[00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.810]  Very effective.
[00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:14.752]  Remember, cell phones are bad.
[00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:16.573]  The radiation from them is extremely bad.
[00:03:17.213 --> 00:03:19.875]  So try to not use them as much as you can.
[00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:21.136]  But that's where everything is converting.
[00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:22.957]  And that's where the hearts and minds are.
[00:03:23.337 --> 00:03:23.938]  So we're there.
[00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.022]  And then, because a lot of times I'll miss an article Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes, Kurt Nemo have done.
[00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:31.243]  But with this Twitter,
[00:03:32.507 --> 00:03:34.148]  And I didn't remember to put it on my phone.
[00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:38.412]  I could just boom, see what the latest is, because they're breaking stuff all the time.
[00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:44.736]  And tips you send us are breaking all the time on Infowars.com and presentplanet.com.
[00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.918]  So we have that Twitter account there.
[00:03:47.318 --> 00:03:48.559]  There's also Flycast.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:59.969]  And I learned that we were listed on there, and that people are listing on their BlackBerrys, on their iPhones, that hundreds of thousands of people every week are tuning in that way.
[00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:09.577]  And so if you want to listen for free to the internet streams, the application costs nothing, you can go to InfoWars.com and link through the listen page and see the Twitter account.
[00:04:11.268 --> 00:04:13.252]  Right there, as well as the Flycast account.
[00:04:13.893 --> 00:04:19.784]  And listeners have said we need our own InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com streaming account.
[00:04:21.437 --> 00:04:22.318]  Our own application.
[00:04:22.358 --> 00:04:35.146]  Hey, if somebody wants to write us an application and give it to us, a little icon that people grab off the site, that people then put on their phone that streams the 16 or 32-bit streams, then we'll do it.
[00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:38.908]  But I mean, I'm flying by the seat of my pants here.
[00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.611]  I was up till, what, 12-15 last night with my IT guys.
[00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:50.035]  And a nice fellow who gave us some good advice about some things to fix with our search engine situation.
[00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:53.457]  And we were upgrading servers, you know, until midnight last night.
[00:04:53.477 --> 00:04:54.578]  I mean, there's not many of us here.
[00:04:54.678 --> 00:04:55.458]  We need your advice.
[00:04:55.758 --> 00:04:56.479]  We need your help.
[00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.302]  If you want to do that, I know there's genius programmers out there and really smart folks.
[00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:02.983]  Help us, Obi-Wan.
[00:05:03.723 --> 00:05:05.464]  You're our only hope, as they say.
[00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:06.665]  Okay, enough said.
[00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:08.686]  Let's go to your phone calls right now.
[00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:10.507]  Wilson in New York.
[00:05:10.647 --> 00:05:11.548]  You are on the air.
[00:05:11.608 --> 00:05:11.928]  Welcome.
[00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:13.561]  Yes, hello.
[00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:15.022]  Good afternoon, Alex Jones.
[00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:24.286]  I'm a 21-year-old kid from New York, and I just really wanted to thank you because you just turned my life around, you know?
[00:05:24.306 --> 00:05:32.289]  Because I used to spend a lot of time hanging out with my friends and smoking and stuff, and I just changed when I realized that
[00:05:34.352 --> 00:05:38.834]  I needed to help get the word out and just help spread the word.
[00:05:38.874 --> 00:05:43.016]  Sometimes when I would tell my friends about it, they would just be like, oh, you're blowing my high, you're wasting my time.
[00:05:43.036 --> 00:05:45.777]  I just really stopped all of that.
[00:05:46.238 --> 00:05:55.342]  Yeah, those are the type of friends you don't want, where they're like, I don't care if bad stuff's happening, I don't want to hear about it, but if you can wake them up, those are the kind of friends you want.
[00:05:56.092 --> 00:06:07.396]  But, I mean, because believe me, sir, friends that don't care about tyranny and don't care about bad things happening to people, and that say, oh, I'm in my own dream world, if you're ever in trouble, you're going to find out they're not really your friends, but go ahead.
[00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:15.699]  Yes, and I just want to say, like, I just see how you, for so long, you've been fighting to get the word out, and people still don't listen, but you continue.
[00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.900]  So I've really been inspired, and I changed my life.
[00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:23.242]  I turned my life around, and I just listen to you all the time, and I do research.
[00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:35.254]  I just wanted to thank you, and it's really hard to tell people, but I always try, and I've been doing it on my mom's Facebook page a lot, just sending out a lot of blogs and stuff.
[00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:44.078]  And I just wanted to ask you a quick question, because I told my mom earlier about the Social Security, like, how was the scheme and stuff.
[00:06:44.098 --> 00:06:45.659]  She was like, well, really, how was it?
[00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:49.341]  Because I know people that got money off Social Security.
[00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:50.942]  Let me tell you how it's a Ponzi scheme.
[00:06:51.442 --> 00:06:52.162]  Is that your question?
[00:06:52.743 --> 00:06:52.963]  Yeah.
[00:06:53.786 --> 00:07:02.152]  Okay, I have a video clip I'm going to play later if we have time in the final hour where what Jim Rogers describes how it's a Ponzi scheme.
[00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:08.597]  We also have one Max Keiser who we've got coming on a couple weeks back on the show, you know, top financial advisor.
[00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:12.180]  He's the inventor of even some of the stock market systems that are used today.
[00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:20.807]  But we don't need a financial expert to tell us what a Ponzi scheme is even though they do in a great fashion, in a very informative fashion.
[00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:30.114]  They take in the new people's money to pay the folks that are supposed to be getting their social security.
[00:07:30.715 --> 00:07:39.341]  That is, the government spends all the social security money that comes in on weapon systems, on buying fake media, on their own Swiss bank accounts.
[00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:46.646]  You know, they spent the money that people that are 70 years old, 65 years old put in 20, 30, 40 years ago.
[00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:50.748]  Now they spend the money as it comes in, the second it comes in.
[00:07:51.428 --> 00:07:58.272]  And so they're taking the new people's money and they're paying the folks that paid in previously.
[00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:01.013]  That's the definition of a Ponzi scheme.
[00:08:01.053 --> 00:08:02.434]  That's how a Ponzi scheme works.
[00:08:04.014 --> 00:08:08.915]  There isn't an investment paying return to the members of the financial instrument.
[00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:12.016]  It is the new people's money that is paying it.
[00:08:12.136 --> 00:08:16.096]  That is the very definition of a Ponzi scheme.
[00:08:18.177 --> 00:08:19.317]  Does that answer your question?
[00:08:19.737 --> 00:08:20.737]  Yes, definitely.
[00:08:20.877 --> 00:08:22.558]  Isn't that similar to how banks work, Bill?
[00:08:23.138 --> 00:08:24.018]  Yes, exactly.
[00:08:24.738 --> 00:08:26.418]  Why can the New World Order always win?
[00:08:26.718 --> 00:08:29.899]  Why do they own the police, the military, the government, the corporations?
[00:08:32.338 --> 00:08:33.319]  Look, I appreciate your call.
[00:08:33.339 --> 00:08:35.460]  Let me comment on this right now, because I need to move on to other callers.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.222]  And again, you bring up such incredible points, sir.
[00:08:38.262 --> 00:08:39.402]  God bless you and have a great New Year.
[00:08:39.442 --> 00:08:39.983]  Okay, Wilson?
[00:08:40.003 --> 00:08:41.664]  Thank you, sir.
[00:08:41.684 --> 00:08:42.344]  Yeah, thanks a million.
[00:08:42.644 --> 00:08:46.086]  Because it's just, I've got to keep myself to time or I'll never get to all the calls.
[00:08:48.948 --> 00:08:49.849]  You hear Christ.
[00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:52.710]  He went into the temple with a whip.
[00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:54.471]  He started beating people.
[00:08:55.392 --> 00:08:56.853]  He overturned the money changers.
[00:08:59.174 --> 00:09:00.235]  Now, who were the money changers?
[00:09:01.795 --> 00:09:11.499]  The money changers, and every culture's had them, every culture has them, the money changers, people don't like to carry around a big bag of gold or silver when that's the main currency.
[00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:14.980]  And so the wealthy wanted to lock it up in a stronghold.
[00:09:16.281 --> 00:09:30.667]  And money changers learned to then put out script or checks saying, you know, Goldsmith Johnson or whatever, or Goldsmith Moonblatt or whatever, Goldsmith John Doe.
[00:09:32.345 --> 00:09:42.033]  And they could then issue checks to people to say, oh, well, you know, I don't care about your gold around or silver, I could be robbed by the rabble in the street.
[00:09:43.034 --> 00:09:50.000]  So I write a IOU or a script that's redeemable at the bank, at the goldsmith's office.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.863]  Generally, the goldsmiths will also be like pawn shops.
[00:09:54.884 --> 00:09:56.845]  You know, quick loans, loan sharking, usury.
[00:09:58.286 --> 00:09:59.788]  It was primitive banks.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:10.182]  And so, the goldsmiths learned, the money changers learned, they could loan out, let's say they had a hundred ounces of gold, they could loan out a thousand.
[00:10:11.383 --> 00:10:12.943]  They didn't really have that, but they could.
[00:10:13.263 --> 00:10:18.785]  And then goldsmiths learned they could buy things with their own script, as long as nobody did a run on the bank.
[00:10:19.565 --> 00:10:27.367]  Now when folks started doing runs on the banks, they learned how to pay off the king and the king of the guards, or the head of the guards, to where
[00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:32.370]  If the people tried to have a run on the bank, the police would kill them.
[00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:40.456]  And then the goldsmiths, a lot of times, would run a big Ponzi scheme and end up maybe having no gold or diamonds or jewels in their vault.
[00:10:40.696 --> 00:10:50.422]  They'd already shipped that to another country, and then they would loan out thousands and thousands of pieces of script or paper, and then they would leave the country, and then everybody would find out there was no gold.
[00:10:52.784 --> 00:10:53.604]  You understand how that works?
[00:10:54.622 --> 00:10:57.863]  But see now, with fractional reserve banking, that's what the banks do.
[00:10:57.943 --> 00:11:03.644]  They get one dollar of your money put in there, and for that dollar to be created, debt was created.
[00:11:03.704 --> 00:11:05.144]  It's paid to them to begin with.
[00:11:06.585 --> 00:11:06.685]  U.S.
[00:11:06.725 --> 00:11:07.365]  taxpayer money.
[00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:09.365]  Dollar in debt for every dollar created.
[00:11:09.665 --> 00:11:13.866]  And then they get that very money that you're paying to give them.
[00:11:16.267 --> 00:11:19.107]  And then, they can loan out 10, 20, 30, 40 times.
[00:11:19.127 --> 00:11:19.808]  Now they do unlimited.
[00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:24.650]  Loans to people.
[00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.551]  And that's why they want to get you bankrupt.
[00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:27.812]  That's why they want you to lose your house.
[00:11:28.092 --> 00:11:29.693]  That's why they want a country in debt.
[00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:31.094]  Because it's nothing.
[00:11:31.134 --> 00:11:32.695]  They get everything for nothing.
[00:11:33.395 --> 00:11:34.696]  But see, now they don't leave the country.
[00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.578]  Now the goldsmiths don't leave the country when they steal all the money.
[00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:42.822]  Now what they do is they own the military.
[00:11:43.182 --> 00:11:44.703]  They do that in third world countries and here.
[00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:48.799]  And now they just step back and go, we're the saviors.
[00:11:48.819 --> 00:11:50.980]  We're going to fix all this when they openly engineered it.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.720]  We're going to take all your money.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.021]  You're going to pay your taxes directly to the Federal Reserve.
[00:11:55.041 --> 00:11:56.062]  That's where you write your check now.
[00:11:56.742 --> 00:11:58.022]  You're going to pay carbon taxes to us.
[00:11:58.062 --> 00:12:03.824]  And if you don't like it, we got ne'er-do-well brainwashed paramilitary police that'll kill your ass.
[00:12:04.164 --> 00:12:04.805]  How's that sound?
[00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:08.746]  With rising unemployment and an economy
[00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:16.261]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:20.508]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:24.433]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[00:12:24.894 --> 00:12:29.821]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law
[00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:37.274]  Keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.
[00:12:37.474 --> 00:12:45.080]  Mr. Defense carries the largest selection of stun guns, air tasers, knives, swords, batons, survival, spy, and tactical gear.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.985]  Surprise your loved ones this Christmas with a gift of safety and security from MrDefense.com.
[00:12:51.365 --> 00:12:53.847]  Mention this ad and receive 10% off your order!
[00:13:06.257 --> 00:13:12.619]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:14.980]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.681]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:17.721]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:18.001 --> 00:13:18.901]  This is his ammo.
[00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:20.282]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:20.362 --> 00:13:22.022]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:22.362 --> 00:13:29.105]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:29.505 --> 00:13:29.945]  Some U.S.
[00:13:29.985 --> 00:13:35.627]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:36.327 --> 00:13:39.869]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:50.075]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:13:50.315 --> 00:13:51.056]  Fabled Enemies.
[00:13:51.536 --> 00:13:58.820]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:59.301 --> 00:14:02.643]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:14:06.499 --> 00:14:10.161]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:14:10.561 --> 00:14:15.983]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:14:16.463 --> 00:14:17.544]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:14:17.584 --> 00:14:21.625]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:14:22.265 --> 00:14:35.511]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:41.394]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:14:41.674 --> 00:14:47.617]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:14:48.317 --> 00:14:49.578]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:49.598 --> 00:14:51.299]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:14:51.319 --> 00:14:51.679]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:51.739 --> 00:14:53.760]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:53.840]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:15:06.221 --> 00:15:08.062]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:15:08.202 --> 00:15:13.383]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:15:13.563 --> 00:15:14.884]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:23.326]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:15:23.566 --> 00:15:29.288]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:15:29.468 --> 00:15:31.249]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:15:31.289 --> 00:15:33.469]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:15:33.489 --> 00:15:37.851]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:15:38.011 --> 00:15:40.131]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:48.074]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:15:55.577 --> 00:15:56.017]  Ah, who's this?
[00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:21.313]  All the tens of millions that his operation killed, they all go down to that little black soul in there.
[00:16:22.173 --> 00:16:26.796]  All the murdered, all the killed, all the carnage.
[00:16:27.096 --> 00:16:31.978]  David Rockefeller as Salacious Crumb.
[00:16:31.998 --> 00:16:34.660]  I talked about it, I don't know, six months ago on air about
[00:16:36.147 --> 00:16:41.311]  David Rockefeller looking like Salacious Crumb, this little creature that sits on Jabba the Hutt's lap.
[00:16:41.671 --> 00:16:44.993]  Since then, some nice lady sent me t-shirts with Salacious Crumb.
[00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:46.975]  The office staff wears them.
[00:16:47.415 --> 00:16:47.955]  I'm not kidding.
[00:16:48.896 --> 00:16:49.717]  I wear mine to work.
[00:16:51.058 --> 00:16:52.479]  Just reminding us of who we're fighting.
[00:16:52.699 --> 00:16:56.682]  And I've been sent this nice coffee cup right here of Salacious Crumb.
[00:16:56.702 --> 00:16:58.503]  I'm showing folks this on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:16:58.583 --> 00:17:05.548]  If you don't know who Salacious Crumb is, he is basically David Rockefeller's totem animal.
[00:17:07.077 --> 00:17:34.297]  and uh... so there he uh... there he is ladies and gentlemen salacious rockefeller's promise let's go back to the phone call short segment here doug in tennessee thank you for holding sir these callers drop right as i go to him susan in minnesota you're on the air hi alex and this last year my mother and i went down to see ron paul at the rally for the republic
[00:17:35.203 --> 00:17:45.328]  And I just wanted to talk about a little bit what that was like to see my city turned into the kind of police state that we saw.
[00:17:45.608 --> 00:17:54.792]  And really it made us sad in many ways because we can remember a time when we knew our officers by first name, we knew their families.
[00:17:56.076 --> 00:18:01.080]  We're in a much different relationship with them, and what we saw there was like a standing army.
[00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:07.185]  Well, they've trained them, they've trained them that that's for their own good, and then they've hired anarchists.
[00:18:07.505 --> 00:18:11.188]  By the way, I've gotten so conditioned to this that I didn't even cover it.
[00:18:11.709 --> 00:18:20.095]  National Greek News admits, it was on PrisonPlanet.com Sunday and Monday, on InfoWars.com, Curt Nemo actually had a story about it,
[00:18:21.036 --> 00:18:25.760]  Well, you guys pull that up, just type into Google, I'm going to put it on screen.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.484]  The headline was, sorry to interrupt, this is just important, I keep forgetting about it, I've been meaning to cover it for days.
[00:18:30.844 --> 00:18:38.991]  The headline, I believe, was Greek Police Caught Posing As Anarchist.
[00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.910]  Yes, right.
[00:18:41.530 --> 00:19:04.696]  But the point is, it's on the news, the cops knocking out windows, attacking people's cars to make the people rebelling look bad, and then Kurt was right, it turns out that that was clearly staged, because you notice it's not real gasoline, it quits burning real fast, it's some type of light alcohol, you know the type they use in Hollywood that doesn't burn real hot, it's still dangerous, you know where they
[00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:10.582]  Have the cop throw them all off at the cop and he goes, oh, you know, for the news cameras, it doesn't roll.
[00:19:11.042 --> 00:19:12.684]  And then suddenly it doesn't burn his clothes.
[00:19:12.724 --> 00:19:19.212]  But turns out, just like Ottawa, Canada, this year, just like Denver, Denver Post, police attack police.
[00:19:20.853 --> 00:19:22.876]  They are busting out the windows in the cars.
[00:19:23.176 --> 00:19:25.138]  The truth is the public
[00:19:26.315 --> 00:19:28.477]  is attacking government buildings and banks.
[00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:39.524]  But see, the cops then go dress up like them with clubs, there's video of it, we'll put it up there, and beat people's cars in knockout windows to get the general public against each other.
[00:19:39.825 --> 00:19:44.168]  Now again, again, I mean, how do they get cops from the U.S.
[00:19:44.188 --> 00:19:46.309]  to Canada to Greece to do this?
[00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:49.071]  It's a criminal organization!
[00:19:51.468 --> 00:19:52.649]  I'm sorry, go ahead and make your point now.
[00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:54.390]  I just wanted to bring that up.
[00:19:55.271 --> 00:19:56.392]  No, that's exactly right.
[00:19:56.492 --> 00:20:01.896]  I mean, as I said, we were sad to see a city we didn't even recognize in the same way.
[00:20:02.457 --> 00:20:09.482]  But we weren't afraid, which is a big difference, I think, for most people when they realize when they start waking up.
[00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:21.693]  They realize that they have to go through a certain fear factor that hits them when they realize how out of the loop they've been and they realize how frightening it can be.
[00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:25.977]  But to go beyond it and to realize that it's important to
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.042]  Stand up, to be there, to have a presence, to participate.
[00:20:31.582 --> 00:20:48.450]  And so my mother is 76, I'm 50, we didn't care, we were not afraid, we walked past a lot of these police lines, and we were representing ourselves with our other fellow citizens, and it was very inspiring.
[00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.212]  And so for the New Year Resolution, I hope to encourage everybody
[00:20:52.725 --> 00:20:54.727]  To get involved and to do the right thing.
[00:20:54.887 --> 00:20:58.570]  Resistance doesn't mean it has to be offensive.
[00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:00.652]  It can be just doing the right thing.
[00:21:02.213 --> 00:21:02.814]  Absolutely.
[00:21:02.854 --> 00:21:04.315]  God bless you and good to hear from you.
[00:21:05.196 --> 00:21:11.962]  The reason I got off on that whole jag was I talked to people that were there reporting for us, then I talked to witnesses, then it turned out it was on the local news.
[00:21:13.383 --> 00:21:18.107]  You'd have these big burly anarchists, you know, they're big cops, because they send the big cops in because, you know, it's dangerous.
[00:21:19.343 --> 00:21:23.749]  I mean, I've literally seen six foot seven Austin cops dressed up like anarchists trying to start stuff before.
[00:21:23.769 --> 00:21:25.471]  And I'm like, come on, you're a cop.
[00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:26.573]  Knock it off, man.
[00:21:26.833 --> 00:21:27.914]  What a criminal action.
[00:21:28.395 --> 00:21:32.380]  You know, a real anarchist is like five foot three on methamphetamine.
[00:21:34.803 --> 00:21:36.805]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:36.825 --> 00:21:38.767]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.311]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:15.095]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[00:22:15.875 --> 00:22:26.022]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen inactive like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[00:22:26.502 --> 00:22:27.403]  Well, snap out of it.
[00:22:27.443 --> 00:22:28.443]  We now have a deadline.
[00:22:28.943 --> 00:22:30.444]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[00:22:30.985 --> 00:22:34.487]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press
[00:22:35.003 --> 00:22:42.289]  And pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:48.554]  Well, I take the general of this word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[00:22:49.015 --> 00:22:53.899]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[00:22:54.439 --> 00:22:58.223]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[00:22:58.783 --> 00:23:00.004]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.945]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:23:12.205 --> 00:23:13.506]  And we knew what to do.
[00:23:13.526 --> 00:23:15.288]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:23:15.528 --> 00:23:21.953]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:23:22.554 --> 00:23:31.081]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:23:31.448 --> 00:23:38.250]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.611]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:46.953]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:23:47.493 --> 00:23:50.114]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:23:50.574 --> 00:23:57.777]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.491]  I suppose the government sponsored terror.
[00:24:01.911 --> 00:24:04.533]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:24:05.833 --> 00:24:11.417]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators, starting at $299.
[00:24:12.057 --> 00:24:25.806]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[00:24:26.026 --> 00:24:29.188]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[00:24:29.548 --> 00:24:30.289]  We're good to go.
[00:24:47.261 --> 00:24:53.584]  Learn more about ozone therapy or ionic zone ozone generators by going to ionic zone dot com or calling 800 5 4 9 95 35.

[00:25:15.725 --> 00:25:21.746]  Throughout history, powerful, ruthless, cunning individuals seek to dominate populations.
[00:25:21.766 --> 00:25:22.686]  They love death.
[00:25:22.826 --> 00:25:23.827]  They love destruction.
[00:25:24.387 --> 00:25:25.887]  They love attacking the innocent.
[00:25:28.047 --> 00:25:33.068]  Well, the greatest manifestation of this dehumanizing evil is now upon us.
[00:25:33.108 --> 00:25:35.449]  It is called the New World Order.
[00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:38.009]  Because everything the enemy does is a deception.
[00:25:38.469 --> 00:25:40.350]  It is truly the Old World Order.
[00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:41.250]  Tyranny!
[00:25:42.435 --> 00:25:46.120]  But the enemy wishes you to believe that they are something new.
[00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:55.271]  When they are as old as the bones of the great old lizard, the old dragon, the old serpent, Beelzebub!
[00:25:57.073 --> 00:26:01.779]  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, you are in the fight of your life.
[00:26:03.072 --> 00:26:04.173]  I am in the fight of my life.
[00:26:04.934 --> 00:26:06.235]  And we are together.
[00:26:07.115 --> 00:26:12.460]  If you haven't chosen sides, that's why you don't feel empowered.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.223]  It's why you feel so anxious.
[00:26:16.343 --> 00:26:17.964]  It's why you feel like you're missing something in your life.
[00:26:19.185 --> 00:26:21.207]  If you join evil, you will be fulfilled.
[00:26:22.884 --> 00:26:24.925]  Because you will now have chosen your destiny.
[00:26:24.965 --> 00:26:30.846]  But if you choose goodness, you will be fulfilled in a way that evil will never fulfill you.
[00:26:31.566 --> 00:26:35.427]  But I tell you now, those of you that are lukewarm, you are the worst.
[00:26:36.267 --> 00:26:38.448]  Because you are neither.
[00:26:38.548 --> 00:26:40.688]  And it is a pathetic state to be in.
[00:26:41.649 --> 00:26:42.549]  I disrespect you.
[00:26:43.509 --> 00:26:46.030]  Those of you that make excuses that don't admit what you're part of.
[00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.670]  If you're going to be evil, you might as well go for the gold.
[00:26:50.691 --> 00:26:51.551]  Go for the prize.
[00:26:52.827 --> 00:26:53.608]  Plumb the depths.
[00:26:55.029 --> 00:27:04.177]  And if you're going to be good, you should throw all caution to the wind and commit yourself to be a good person and to lead and to guide and direct and to help people.
[00:27:04.758 --> 00:27:06.359]  And to ask God to lead, guide, and direct you.
[00:27:07.941 --> 00:27:09.642]  Alright, look, it's totally jam-packed.
[00:27:09.662 --> 00:27:15.868]  I want to get into the body snatchers as an analogy to what it's like to live in a society with these people under government mind control.
[00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:19.103]  I want to get into a ton of news.
[00:27:19.183 --> 00:27:21.004]  And yes, I said I'm taking a lot of calls today.
[00:27:21.385 --> 00:27:25.228]  Mike, Ken, Mark, Dave, Justin and others are going to you here in just a moment.
[00:27:26.189 --> 00:27:28.912]  But I wanted to direct you to a story we're going to cover first.
[00:27:29.673 --> 00:27:33.836]  National Guard soldiers to usher in the new year at Times Square.
[00:27:34.677 --> 00:27:39.721]  So, we're going to be going over this report right after I tell you about a couple of our sponsors.
[00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:48.709]  Yes, I have done an hour, two hours, two hours and thirty-five minutes of broadcast today, and I've not plugged any of our sponsors, including my books and videos.
[00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.532]  And that's how we fund this operation.
[00:27:52.572 --> 00:27:53.353]  I mean, this isn't cheap.
[00:27:53.373 --> 00:27:57.376]  We've got two guys, a third guy in their training to run the TV show and things.
[00:27:57.396 --> 00:27:58.357]  We're doing this on the cheaps.
[00:27:59.585 --> 00:28:03.748]  You know, we've got this office filmmaking, the websites, the servers.
[00:28:04.508 --> 00:28:08.491]  Infowars.com is rated 2,000 places above Rush Limbaugh.com.
[00:28:09.031 --> 00:28:13.194]  PrisonPlanet.com, you know, is rated above some of the biggest websites out there.
[00:28:13.595 --> 00:28:15.676]  It's expensive just to pay for the bandwidth for these babies.
[00:28:16.316 --> 00:28:18.258]  And we need your support, but that's not even the reason.
[00:28:18.298 --> 00:28:28.605]  That's an added caveat that when you buy books and videos from the Secure Online Video and Bookstore at Infowars.com, you support everything we're doing here.
[00:28:29.551 --> 00:28:30.652]  That's a side issue though.
[00:28:31.132 --> 00:28:33.094]  You get material that's informative and dynamic.
[00:28:33.374 --> 00:28:34.976]  Now this is award winning.
[00:28:34.996 --> 00:28:37.258]  This has won all these top awards in Europe and the US.
[00:28:37.658 --> 00:28:40.020]  This is better than some Discovery Channel show.
[00:28:40.781 --> 00:28:43.944]  A top director out of France made it, but it's in English.
[00:28:45.345 --> 00:28:46.846]  The World According to Monsanto.
[00:28:46.886 --> 00:28:47.807]  We just got these in.
[00:28:51.377 --> 00:28:57.640]  There's a bonus film on RBGH, Growth Hormone and Milk, plus a free audio CD with the two-hour film.
[00:28:58.161 --> 00:29:04.084]  From Agent Orange to Genetically Modified Crops, a biotech giant with your best interest at heart.
[00:29:05.365 --> 00:29:07.806]  I'm sure you know this stuff's bad, and you've seen the documents.
[00:29:08.266 --> 00:29:09.627]  Your neighbors aren't going to read documents.
[00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:11.348]  They're not going to listen to the show with all the facts.
[00:29:11.788 --> 00:29:14.730]  You give them a fancy-looking video like this, packaging's everything.
[00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.411]  And boy, let me tell you, the cover matches the info.
[00:29:17.831 --> 00:29:18.872]  And you give this to somebody.
[00:29:18.892 --> 00:29:21.473]  It's available for $19.95 at InfoWars.com.
[00:29:21.933 --> 00:29:24.034]  It's two films and an audio CD.
[00:29:24.054 --> 00:29:26.315]  $19.95, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:27.075 --> 00:29:28.276]  Go buy ten of these suckers.
[00:29:28.336 --> 00:29:29.036]  Give them to people.
[00:29:29.956 --> 00:29:32.157]  I didn't make this film, so I can't tell you to make copies of it.
[00:29:32.498 --> 00:29:33.898]  My films, I want you to get in-game.
[00:29:33.918 --> 00:29:34.378]  TerrorStorm.
[00:29:36.365 --> 00:29:39.568]  Fabled Enemies, Truth Rising, and I want you to make copies.
[00:29:39.608 --> 00:29:40.789]  That's what's going to bring them to their knees.
[00:29:41.449 --> 00:29:44.632]  So, The World According to Monsanto, the newest item at InfoWars.com.
[00:29:44.652 --> 00:29:51.557]  You can also call toll-free to order at 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:29:51.598 --> 00:29:54.380]  Here's our latest film I produced, Jason Bermas made it.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:03.908]  A pretty controversial 9-11 film for us to make, and seven years after 9-11, this supposed mastermind behind the attacks is still at large, and the nation is
[00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:07.430]  Entrenched in multiple wars in the Middle East.
[00:30:08.151 --> 00:30:12.393]  Is Bin Laden the evil behind the attack, or a mere front man in a larger picture?
[00:30:13.194 --> 00:30:13.674]  A boogeyman.
[00:30:14.154 --> 00:30:17.816]  We are told we are fighting a war on terror, and that the terrorists hate us for our freedom.
[00:30:18.277 --> 00:30:21.919]  If that is the case, why do our leaders take more and more of our freedoms away?
[00:30:22.299 --> 00:30:26.482]  And Barry Jennings, the deputy head of emergency management who blew the whistle on the film, he died
[00:30:27.651 --> 00:30:28.712]  So he's dead.
[00:30:29.092 --> 00:30:34.435]  Michael J. Springman, Visa Department head, who said that they were CIA agents, Mohammed Adam and everybody.
[00:30:35.155 --> 00:30:37.137]  Bo Deedle, former NYPD detective.
[00:30:38.477 --> 00:30:40.839]  Cynthia McKinney, Mike Rivero, Joe Biden.
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.241]  I mean, this film needs to be seen.
[00:30:45.619 --> 00:30:46.560]  The Money Masters.
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.041]  Three and a half hour film.
[00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:51.604]  You want to have a master's degree in the private banks, the New World Order?
[00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:53.426]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:53.726 --> 00:30:54.546]  The Money Masters.
[00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:55.948]  How the banks create the world's money.
[00:30:56.248 --> 00:30:56.968]  How they rule us.
[00:30:57.189 --> 00:31:02.413]  I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me trouble for the safety of my country.
[00:31:02.693 --> 00:31:13.522]  Corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated
[00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:17.086]  In a few hands, and the Republic destroyed Abraham Lincoln.
[00:31:18.568 --> 00:31:28.380]  Andrew Jackson, if Congress has the right under the Constitution to issue paper money, it has given them to use themselves, not to be delegated to individuals or corporations.
[00:31:29.394 --> 00:31:30.434]  Another one from Thomas Jefferson.
[00:31:30.474 --> 00:31:43.758]  If the people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks that will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.
[00:31:44.298 --> 00:31:49.099]  The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it belongs.
[00:31:49.139 --> 00:31:49.819]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:49.819]  1995.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.960]  It's like 30 bucks everywhere else, folks.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.201]  This is a three and a half hour film on two DVDs.
[00:31:58.676 --> 00:32:02.400]  And then we've got Mark Dice's Resistance Manifesto, the new edition.
[00:32:03.462 --> 00:32:06.685]  The Rise of the Fourth Reich, the Nazi System in Control of the West.
[00:32:07.606 --> 00:32:08.587]  Just amazing film.
[00:32:08.647 --> 00:32:10.389]  Not Nazis, the fascist system.
[00:32:13.052 --> 00:32:14.513]  And then, oh, we have my journal.
[00:32:14.714 --> 00:32:15.535]  You can't sell that.
[00:32:16.616 --> 00:32:19.199]  This is just my little ideas and things, like a little Tweety Bird on it.
[00:32:20.486 --> 00:32:21.709]  Kinda like salacious crumb over there.
[00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:23.533]  Alright, anyways, folks.
[00:32:23.633 --> 00:32:24.174]  Okay, that's it.
[00:32:24.194 --> 00:32:26.339]  I'm done plugging the books, the videos.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.822]  We do need your support.
[00:32:28.897 --> 00:32:31.378]  The economy is falling apart, as you know, I won't lie to you.
[00:32:32.498 --> 00:32:36.700]  This is the way we wake people up and get the word out, and our video sales were down by 50%.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.700]  Now they're down by 70%.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.401]  I'm sure your business is doing the same, too.
[00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:42.202]  Everything is falling apart, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:42.422 --> 00:32:46.443]  That's why we are, as things get worse, we're expanding.
[00:32:46.483 --> 00:32:47.663]  We're moving forward.
[00:32:48.104 --> 00:32:51.605]  We're putting out our maximum effort to fight the New World Order.
[00:32:52.205 --> 00:32:59.967]  And we need your financial support to do it, so please fuel our little F-16s in the Info War so we can drop Info Bombs on the enemy and unlock mines.
[00:33:01.248 --> 00:33:01.608]  All right.
[00:33:01.628 --> 00:33:04.488]  You know what?
[00:33:04.508 --> 00:33:11.270]  Let's go to Mike, Ken, Mark, David, Justin, and then I'm going to get into all this military news and the U.S.
[00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:12.511]  Ambassador to the U.N.
[00:33:12.571 --> 00:33:17.532]  saying that this Israeli situation may be a prelude to an attack on Iran.
[00:33:17.672 --> 00:33:18.452]  Very serious.
[00:33:19.233 --> 00:33:20.693]  Let me give each caller a minute.
[00:33:22.176 --> 00:33:23.837]  Mike in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:33:24.437 --> 00:33:25.137]  Hello Alex, how are you?
[00:33:25.438 --> 00:33:25.778]  Good, sir.
[00:33:26.958 --> 00:33:30.880]  I heard you talking earlier today in your broadcast about E. coli and E. coli byproducts.
[00:33:32.221 --> 00:33:40.605]  I'm a biochemist and I work for Ortho Clinical Diagnostics and I have worked with HB101, which is a non-pathogenic form of E. coli.
[00:33:41.366 --> 00:33:43.508]  There's many variants of E. coli.
[00:33:43.968 --> 00:33:44.929]  There's probably hundreds.
[00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:50.493]  You can't be sure of everything that's out there because there's bio... Yeah, I thought there were thousands of E. coli, yeah.
[00:33:50.513 --> 00:33:50.753]  Oh, sure.
[00:33:50.773 --> 00:33:57.238]  I mean, there's people working with them, transfecting genes constantly with them so it can change, you know, at lightning speed.
[00:33:57.458 --> 00:33:59.740]  Yeah, they get more mutations to find what they're looking for.
[00:34:00.333 --> 00:34:03.134]  Right, I used to produce fluorescent green protein with them.
[00:34:03.614 --> 00:34:06.035]  The neat thing about HP101 is they're like a blank slate.
[00:34:06.055 --> 00:34:09.036]  You transfect genes into them and they'll make whatever you tell them to make.
[00:34:09.636 --> 00:34:16.078]  We make human insulin with them, which was a remarkable breakthrough because we used to have to rely on pig insulin for people who are diabetic.
[00:34:16.118 --> 00:34:23.541]  Now we have huge, you know, 30,000 pound vats of E. coli who are just pumping out and producing insulin for people
[00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:30.207]  I know, but my point is, I tell the audience that aspartame is basically produced by E. coli, and they tell me I'm a liar.
[00:34:30.307 --> 00:34:37.854]  And that's why I'm calling, because that's absolutely true, that's what's going on, and what's really fearful is what else are they making with it.
[00:34:38.654 --> 00:34:43.899]  We've transfected genes, human genes, retroviruses, and the list goes on and on.
[00:34:43.939 --> 00:34:50.525]  I spoke with Dr. Bauer over at the U of R, University of Rochester, with a program that they have over there where they're packaging viruses.
[00:34:51.885 --> 00:34:54.406]  This has become a cottage industry for them.
[00:34:54.986 --> 00:34:55.987]  They ship these things out.
[00:34:56.527 --> 00:34:58.808]  I'm sure it's proprietary type of technology.
[00:34:58.928 --> 00:35:06.531]  And they're taking the genetics they breed in the bacteria and injecting it into another life form and then into another life form and it's in our food.
[00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:16.274]  And then I talked to top scientists, but you work in this, tell me if that's correct, that then it's randomly mutating once it's put in another organism and they have no idea.
[00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:18.335]  And this is just going on everywhere.
[00:35:19.295 --> 00:35:46.726]  This is the most scary thing about biology, and that, you know, I don't fear nuclear effects, nuclear wars, much as, or chemical warfare, as I do biological warfare, because once the gene is out of the bottle, it's out of control, it's in nature's hands, you can't predict what it will do, what will happen in the future, it could be the most horrific thing that nobody, the consequences that nobody ever expected, and this is the problem with a lot of what's going on with the government's experimentation in this, the military's,
[00:35:47.126 --> 00:35:49.167]  The government and military's motives cannot be trusted.
[00:35:49.728 --> 00:35:53.910]  I remember the spider-goat work at the Plattsburgh Military Facility in New York State, which isn't far from me.
[00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.651]  I interviewed the director of that!
[00:35:56.011 --> 00:36:13.120]  Yeah, I have a colleague who worked at the Spider Thread Protein Project 15 years ago at the U of R. They could never get the protein right, so someone came up with a bright idea, and it was genius to transfect the spider's gene to make the protein into a larger domesticated animal, and they chose goats to do so because it was easier to extract the protein out of the milk.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.982]  All these things are very easily done.
[00:36:16.082 --> 00:36:21.425]  There are biochemical companies out there that sell gene slicing and splicing agents.
[00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:23.847]  Slicing is cutting bonds or cutting cell walls and so on.
[00:36:24.347 --> 00:36:27.789]  In the biochemical world, this is a huge part of the industry and very common.
[00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:39.857]  It actually can be a very good thing and there's nothing wrong with it per se, but when you get into the abuses of this technology, the consequences are monstrous and that's really a very fearful thing and everything has to be monitored very closely.
[00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:41.810]  What are people doing with it?
[00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:42.650]  What are they trying to do with it?
[00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:55.073]  And now they're building 36 level 4 bioweapons labs, moving them from Plum Island to Kansas, moving them from the desert in Area 51 to San Antonio, Texas.
[00:36:55.473 --> 00:37:00.693]  And then who released the weaponized foot-and-mouth in 2000 that the government used to shut down the farms and ranches?
[00:37:01.034 --> 00:37:04.514]  They admit the government released it, but it was an accident.
[00:37:05.234 --> 00:37:09.015]  And the stuff we know... I mean, I'll see a blurb in the Washington Post about
[00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:25.741]  Human genes in chimpanzees in Argentina, and then you tell the public that and they don't believe you, or human-animal hybrids they already have, and you tell the public, and imagine if they're admitting all that, what is it we don't know about in black ops?
[00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:26.801]  Well, they're not telling you.
[00:37:26.821 --> 00:37:34.543]  I get emails quite often in the last year or so from the Department of Defense looking for people to work in their military projects.
[00:37:34.863 --> 00:37:37.764]  Have you heard the story about my dad, the dentist, oral surgeon?
[00:37:38.144 --> 00:37:47.106]  When I was in the mid-eighties, they tried to hire him and a bunch of other dentists and it was a huge industrial underground by underground secret operation.
[00:37:47.186 --> 00:37:47.867]  Double the money.
[00:37:48.067 --> 00:37:48.667]  He said no.
[00:37:49.147 --> 00:37:49.827]  But exactly.
[00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:51.067]  And see, they contacted you.
[00:37:51.287 --> 00:37:53.048]  I mean, how big are these projects?
[00:37:53.348 --> 00:37:54.832]  Yeah, there's so much going on.
[00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:58.120]  They said they would waive all the restrictions for military enrollment.
[00:37:58.864 --> 00:38:00.065]  Your age, everything else.
[00:38:00.585 --> 00:38:01.906]  They want a lot of people.
[00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:04.088]  They're looking for a lot of people to work on these projects.
[00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:07.730]  And what scares me a little bit about the projects are that it's like working for the mob.
[00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:08.651]  It's being married to the mob.
[00:38:08.691 --> 00:38:10.272]  You don't retire from these projects.
[00:38:10.312 --> 00:38:11.232]  They retire you from them.
[00:38:11.332 --> 00:38:18.217]  And now, they've got the Human Genome Project and that National Geographic Front to get everybody's roots.
[00:38:18.617 --> 00:38:23.480]  And they've been taking blood for 35 years from everybody born, that's now admitted, in a secret DNA database.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.642]  They've got race-specific bioweapons for individuals.
[00:38:26.702 --> 00:38:27.363]  And I've told them,
[00:38:28.183 --> 00:38:29.885]  Tell folks about that.
[00:38:44.252 --> 00:38:47.414]  Well, even AIDS is very specific like that.
[00:38:47.454 --> 00:38:54.497]  AIDS was probably one of their first projects 30 years ago where it is more prone to non-Caucasians.
[00:38:55.238 --> 00:39:00.500]  There's different types of our antibody systems that are a little bit different from... Isn't it the coupler?
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:07.704]  I think it's coupler 19 and it becomes somewhat race specific.
[00:39:10.573 --> 00:39:16.259]  I mean, I would be very, from an academic perspective, very interested to see how far they've come with this.
[00:39:16.379 --> 00:39:22.205]  I went back to get re-educated in the biochemical field three years ago.
[00:39:22.225 --> 00:39:25.328]  I'll go back and finish up with my masters.
[00:39:26.255 --> 00:39:33.044]  It amazed me at how far that this industry and this technology has come in the last 10-15 years.
[00:39:33.384 --> 00:39:35.527]  And this is what we're teaching at the university level.
[00:39:35.868 --> 00:39:38.171]  What's going on in other laboratories?
[00:39:38.231 --> 00:39:43.958]  Yeah, to explain what's being taught at the university level is generally five years behind the most advanced stuff.
[00:39:44.679 --> 00:40:12.215]  Well, I mean, I remember seeing 10 years ago, 11 years ago, glowing monkeys in Hong Kong, just like in Blade Runner, where he's going around buying genetically engineered snakes or whatever, or cockatoos, or owls, where, and this was like in the BBC, in the Washington Post, and then I remember seeing videos of glowing monkeys in the dark, they've got massive jellyfish genes in them, and then I cover it on air and listeners call me a liar!
[00:40:12.235 --> 00:40:13.896]  I mean, it's just denial!
[00:40:14.036 --> 00:40:18.998]  That technology is almost, that specific technology is almost, I've got to say, 15 to 20 years old.
[00:40:20.738 --> 00:40:28.421]  We use that for, right now in good scenarios, we use it in tracing movement of fluids and minerals through plant life.
[00:40:29.099 --> 00:40:31.600]  And through even perhaps animal life.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:37.361]  Yeah, instead of injecting radioactive dyes, we can use them as a visual indicator.
[00:40:37.801 --> 00:40:41.061]  Out in Cornell here in New York State, they use that quite extensively.
[00:40:41.582 --> 00:40:52.164]  It's less evasive in the field, and you can put it on the ground, plant life will absorb it, and it's not hazardous like using radioactive... Hey, what do you think the chemtrails are?
[00:40:52.184 --> 00:40:53.004]  What do you think they're spraying?
[00:40:53.864 --> 00:41:02.770]  Boy, I don't know, and I'm real fearful of that, because again, here we go with polluting the environment, and it's something that you almost can't escape, because it gets in the air, the water, the soil.
[00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:03.791]  Here's the big problem.
[00:41:04.491 --> 00:41:05.472]  You're a scientist, and...
[00:41:07.341 --> 00:41:09.042]  We know the globalists are psychopaths.
[00:41:09.062 --> 00:41:10.342]  They've got everything compartmentalized.
[00:41:10.362 --> 00:41:12.043]  This was all set up to carry out eugenics.
[00:41:12.323 --> 00:41:15.805]  We know the Rockefellers in the 30s isolated that most cancer was viral.
[00:41:16.345 --> 00:41:19.566]  We know that they're weaponized cancer programs what created the HIV.
[00:41:19.586 --> 00:41:20.487]  That's declassified.
[00:41:21.367 --> 00:41:22.828]  And they are sworn to kill us.
[00:41:22.868 --> 00:41:25.409]  And I'm telling you, they're going to get their police state in place.
[00:41:26.149 --> 00:41:29.752]  They're going to get us, you know, under their control and they're going to kill everybody.
[00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:32.974]  And I want the cops and people listening, you think you're going to win?
[00:41:32.994 --> 00:41:34.595]  You think it's going to be fun rolling America?
[00:41:34.935 --> 00:41:36.136]  You know, taking us down?
[00:41:36.196 --> 00:41:36.936]  You got the power?
[00:41:36.976 --> 00:41:37.517]  Ha ha ha.
[00:41:37.917 --> 00:41:42.220]  You have no idea who you're working for and no idea what's happening to all of you.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:42.800]  All of you.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.341]  Well, that's what's important.
[00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:53.568]  Like with your previous guest about, you know, purchasing food directly from farmers that hasn't been tampered with, hasn't been irradiated, hasn't been pasteurized.
[00:41:53.848 --> 00:41:55.449]  I grew up with non-pasteurized milk.
[00:41:57.245 --> 00:41:58.405]  I grew up on a semi-farm.
[00:41:58.425 --> 00:42:00.306]  We raised our own cattle, pigs.
[00:42:00.546 --> 00:42:02.567]  We made our own food.
[00:42:02.607 --> 00:42:06.129]  We made everything from our own mustard and things like this.
[00:42:06.149 --> 00:42:13.272]  I made maple syrup and we just lived off the land and that's what people really need to realize is just about everything you buy in the grocery store has been tampered with, altered.
[00:42:13.292 --> 00:42:19.655]  I can't believe the garbage when you read the label, how many chemicals are in just fruit juice or something that you buy off of.
[00:42:19.675 --> 00:42:23.097]  But you know they have all these byproducts left over from the oil industry.
[00:42:23.417 --> 00:42:24.497]  They've got to put them somewhere.
[00:42:26.806 --> 00:42:29.357]  Yeah, we have sodium fluoride to crack the oil.
[00:42:30.768 --> 00:42:38.270]  Yeah, it's just amazing that you find that in food or even just, you know, I shouldn't say food or consumable products because when you read a label it tells you it's poison not to swallow it.
[00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:40.470]  Hey, you know, I'd like to have you on as a guest.
[00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:48.032]  I don't know if you want to go public with your name or recommend any other doctors or scientists you think we ought to interview because all your info you're saying checks out.
[00:42:48.052 --> 00:42:49.092]  I'd love to have you on as a guest.
[00:42:49.112 --> 00:42:50.913]  You're really a well-spoken fellow.
[00:42:51.273 --> 00:42:54.494]  Will you email Aaron at InfoWars.com if you want to come on?
[00:42:54.894 --> 00:42:58.315]  Okay, just Aaron at InfoWars and it's E-I-R-R-E.
[00:42:58.795 --> 00:43:00.155]  It's A-R-O-N.
[00:43:00.717 --> 00:43:01.117]  Yeah.
[00:43:03.219 --> 00:43:03.739]  Thank you, sir.
[00:43:03.759 --> 00:43:04.920]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.882]  Are you one of the millions of sinus and allergy sufferers?
[00:43:09.082 --> 00:43:10.203]  Is your nose stuffed up?
[00:43:10.223 --> 00:43:14.405]  Do you experience sinus headaches, allergy symptoms, infections, or post-nasal drip?
[00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:17.087]  Does your treatment improve your body's disease-fighting function?
[00:43:17.267 --> 00:43:18.988]  Or are you simply treating the symptoms?

[00:44:15.703 --> 00:44:16.704]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:17.244 --> 00:44:17.725]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:18.045 --> 00:44:19.005]  This is his M.O.
[00:44:19.026 --> 00:44:20.326]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:20.387 --> 00:44:22.008]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:22.408 --> 00:44:29.153]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:29.553 --> 00:44:29.994]  Some U.S.
[00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:35.698]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:36.378 --> 00:44:39.861]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:39.881 --> 00:44:42.683]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:06.972 --> 00:45:10.795]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.

[00:46:04.255 --> 00:46:13.421]  Yeah, I hope that microbiologist will send me his email and we'll have him on.
[00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:17.864]  You know, we've had a lot of top microbiologists on, dealing with it.
[00:46:19.065 --> 00:46:23.648]  And like that news clip that played yesterday, they don't want most of the public knowing what they're doing.
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:41.793]  And the problem is Dr. Eric Pionka is a biologist and he's got a bunch of microbiologists that graduated out from under him that sent me threatening emails with links to their graduate papers where they said they want to kill everybody.
[00:46:43.038 --> 00:46:48.342]  And then you Google them, and you see them in white lab coats, and they're working in bioweapons labs.
[00:46:49.042 --> 00:46:52.204]  I mean, we got people saying they want to kill us working in bioweapons labs.
[00:46:52.224 --> 00:46:56.447]  They don't want to kill the Ruskies, they don't want to kill the Chycoms, they don't want to kill the Arabs.
[00:46:56.487 --> 00:47:00.549]  I know a lot of you good old boys, you know, have been dehumanized.
[00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:04.992]  Oh, you didn't know when you dehumanize somebody else, you get dehumanized?
[00:47:05.112 --> 00:47:05.333]  Oh yeah.
[00:47:06.198 --> 00:47:08.021]  This is for you, and they're going to kill you.
[00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:09.624]  They're going to kill you, and they're going to kill your family.
[00:47:10.145 --> 00:47:13.190]  And that's why nothing really matters to me anymore, other than saving people.
[00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:14.312]  The species matters.
[00:47:14.453 --> 00:47:15.815]  I'm not worried about being killed.
[00:47:16.136 --> 00:47:18.940]  I'm not worried about being arrested, or set up, or taken to prison.
[00:47:20.168 --> 00:47:23.970]  I only keep my nose clean in everything I do so they don't have an excuse to come after me.
[00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:26.311]  And so if they do come after me, it'll be a total setup.
[00:47:26.912 --> 00:47:27.432]  And I'm ready.
[00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:28.853]  I am honored.
[00:47:29.653 --> 00:47:32.975]  I mean, if I knew it would save a million people right now, folks, I'd jump into a meat grinder.
[00:47:33.476 --> 00:47:34.556]  Wouldn't think five seconds.
[00:47:34.816 --> 00:47:35.577]  Save a million children.
[00:47:35.617 --> 00:47:36.337]  Jump in that meat grinder.
[00:47:36.357 --> 00:47:36.597]  Boom!
[00:47:36.637 --> 00:47:37.598]  I'd kill myself just like that.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:38.820]  Okay?
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.223]  And I wouldn't even call it killing myself, I mean to stop those children being hurt.
[00:47:42.763 --> 00:47:44.464]  I will not be part of this crap.
[00:47:45.065 --> 00:47:48.267]  And I want that to be clear right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:49.748 --> 00:47:51.849]  I understand that the species is what's important.
[00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:54.771]  My only fear is now for the species.
[00:47:56.553 --> 00:48:01.616]  God Almighty, folks, you just cannot imagine how evil the forces are we're dealing with here.
[00:48:02.357 --> 00:48:03.858]  They love destroying life.
[00:48:03.898 --> 00:48:06.440]  They love destroying and wrecking everything that's good.
[00:48:07.731 --> 00:48:10.594]  And none of the real environmental issues are being addressed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:11.034 --> 00:48:15.158]  They got corn and wheat and stuff growing that's got every type of genetic engineered organism in it.
[00:48:15.578 --> 00:48:18.501]  It's spreading all over, all sorts of illnesses and sicknesses.
[00:48:19.201 --> 00:48:20.182]  I mean, we're screwed, folks.
[00:48:20.242 --> 00:48:22.384]  I mean, it's already devastation.
[00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:28.890]  The Earth is already devastated by what they've done, and we don't even imagine what they're doing we don't know about.
[00:48:32.489 --> 00:48:36.592]  Yeah, now I'm not too worried about my hair falling out anymore.
[00:48:37.093 --> 00:48:38.914]  Now I'm not too worried about what people think of me.
[00:48:39.455 --> 00:48:43.498]  I watch these yuppies walk into restaurants or something, they're all real insecure so they act real tough and cool.
[00:48:44.499 --> 00:48:48.883]  The general public, you see poor folks that feel real insecure about themselves when they come in places.
[00:48:49.263 --> 00:48:50.324]  Who cares, man?
[00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:58.711]  We're on a giant rock planetoid with a tiny thin atmosphere hurtling through space with psycho-scientists running the planet bringing in tyranny.
[00:49:00.758 --> 00:49:04.140]  I'm like the guy at the end of the Body Snatchers going, you're in danger!
[00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:05.341]  We've got a fight!
[00:49:05.401 --> 00:49:07.483]  And people are going, ah, shut up, crazy man!
[00:49:07.843 --> 00:49:09.064]  I swear it's deadly!
[00:49:09.084 --> 00:49:10.925]  I've interviewed all the top scientists!
[00:49:10.985 --> 00:49:12.046]  It's killing you!
[00:49:12.506 --> 00:49:13.147]  It's hurting you!
[00:49:13.187 --> 00:49:13.907]  Oh, shut up!
[00:49:14.007 --> 00:49:14.988]  I love GMO!
[00:49:16.049 --> 00:49:17.530]  You know, and I'm like, no, please!
[00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:18.370]  They're psychos!
[00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:19.211]  They're on documents!
[00:49:19.251 --> 00:49:19.471]  Look!
[00:49:20.072 --> 00:49:21.733]  I bet there's documents!
[00:49:26.724 --> 00:49:31.407]  And I can't believe I'm the cutting edge, the front, the tip of the spear.
[00:49:31.667 --> 00:49:33.368]  I don't have some big, giant image of myself.
[00:49:33.849 --> 00:49:38.412]  I'm just a normal person who read history, studied history, happened to run into history.
[00:49:38.432 --> 00:49:39.933]  I read history because it was entertaining.
[00:49:40.513 --> 00:49:41.093]  It was interesting.
[00:49:43.395 --> 00:49:47.057]  You know, my mom was a history major, so when I was growing up, I cracked a history book.
[00:49:47.157 --> 00:49:51.860]  Every page was jam-packed with action-packed info.
[00:49:52.501 --> 00:49:53.321]  And this wasn't fiction.
[00:49:53.361 --> 00:49:53.902]  This was real.
[00:49:55.086 --> 00:50:06.315]  So I learned how government worked, and then I went to college, and they lied and said that wasn't how it worked, and told me world government was good, and then I'd see CNN telling me world government didn't exist at night, then at school they'd tell me world government was good.
[00:50:06.335 --> 00:50:13.661]  And then I found out who the world government is, that they want to kill us, and they constantly talk about it.
[00:50:14.485 --> 00:50:23.172]  And then I learned that top scientists give speeches where they say they want to kill 90% of us at least, and they get standing ovations with the scientists crying.
[00:50:23.412 --> 00:50:25.134]  This is a cult, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:25.414 --> 00:50:26.495]  Oh, yes, kill everyone!
[00:50:26.875 --> 00:50:27.896]  Oh, it's so, oh!
[00:50:28.316 --> 00:50:28.977]  Oh, God!
[00:50:28.997 --> 00:50:35.622]  And then I criticize them, so I get their graduate students going, here's my paper on humans being a parasite.
[00:50:35.902 --> 00:50:37.504]  I can't wait till we're all dead.
[00:50:37.804 --> 00:50:40.186]  By the way, I work in a bioweapons laboratory.
[00:50:40.426 --> 00:50:43.909]  I mean, can you understand what we're facing?
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.082]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:49.722 --> 00:50:54.045]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:56.567 --> 00:50:57.948]  It is a big idea.
[00:50:57.968 --> 00:51:00.089]  A new world order.
[00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:05.393]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:51:05.673 --> 00:51:07.835]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:08.515 --> 00:51:10.777]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:11.317 --> 00:51:13.699]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:14.475 --> 00:51:21.857]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:24.838 --> 00:51:29.799]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:30.279 --> 00:51:33.760]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:36.621]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:36.721 --> 00:51:37.861]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:37.881 --> 00:51:38.641]  They're not after money.
[00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:39.742]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:39.942 --> 00:51:40.642]  They're after power.
[00:51:40.922 --> 00:51:41.763]  That's their app to news you.

[00:51:53.593 --> 00:51:54.774]  You have been warned.
[00:51:58.857 --> 00:52:00.799]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:52:01.239 --> 00:52:04.002]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:10.657 --> 00:52:10.898]  Yeah, I think.
[00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:27.232]  Already in the final hour of the final transmission, the desperate alert beacon to free humanity.
[00:52:27.492 --> 00:52:44.137]  Those of you that are under complete and total mind control, those of you out there that I can still reach, turn off the mainline television set, be aware of the flicker rate, be aware of the programming, be aware of the GMO weapon attack you're under, be aware of the chemical attacks that you're under, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:47.196 --> 00:52:48.517]  Alright, let's jam in your phone calls.
[00:52:48.557 --> 00:52:52.599]  I got a ton of news I gotta get to and some video clips today.
[00:52:52.619 --> 00:52:58.501]  I gotta act like Speed Racer when it comes to getting all this information in.
[00:52:59.102 --> 00:53:01.263]  But how could I not keep Mike on for five, six minutes?
[00:53:01.283 --> 00:53:02.383]  That was an amazing call.
[00:53:02.784 --> 00:53:04.264]  Let's go to Ken in Texas.
[00:53:04.304 --> 00:53:05.245]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:53:05.305 --> 00:53:05.625]  Welcome.
[00:53:06.138 --> 00:53:07.779]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[00:53:08.239 --> 00:53:12.921]  I've got a couple comments before I make my 2009 prediction, if that's alright.
[00:53:13.021 --> 00:53:13.542]  Yes, sir!
[00:53:13.842 --> 00:53:22.966]  Watching you here on prisonplanet.tv, the difference in prisonplanet.tv and listening on the radio is night and day.
[00:53:23.106 --> 00:53:25.888]  I'm telling you, Alex is entertaining as hell.
[00:53:27.588 --> 00:53:31.030]  Y'all won't believe it, but he has a fantastic smile.
[00:53:31.951 --> 00:53:33.351]  And the other point is,
[00:53:35.356 --> 00:53:37.597]  I am so grateful for this program.
[00:53:37.617 --> 00:53:39.518]  I've gotten so much information.
[00:53:39.598 --> 00:53:40.758]  I really appreciate it.
[00:53:41.118 --> 00:53:49.282]  But most importantly, I appreciate the listeners, because the listeners is what's changing this country and the world.
[00:53:50.002 --> 00:53:57.725]  Now my prediction is, I believe this year, that we, the people, are literally going to change this country and the world.
[00:53:57.785 --> 00:53:58.826]  They say it only takes 5%.
[00:54:00.447 --> 00:54:13.732]  And I heard on GCN Radio, I don't know whether it's Alex Jones Show or some other show, that there's over 1 billion people in the world are aware of what's going on and who's been causing all these problems.
[00:54:14.132 --> 00:54:16.653]  And 1 billion is 20% of the population.
[00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:20.694]  The problem is they're isolated and they feel like they're alone.
[00:54:21.034 --> 00:54:26.356]  The final illusion that has to fall is that we're not the majority, that we are the majority.
[00:54:26.676 --> 00:54:32.926]  You know, it's like 92% in every major poll, it's 90-95, and I say 92 is the average, knowing the government killed JFK.
[00:54:33.226 --> 00:54:35.850]  That 8% sits up there and tells us we're a bunch of kooks?
[00:54:36.351 --> 00:54:41.419]  I don't care what they say on their high horses, or how many fake TV programs they make with baloney evidence.
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.421]  The evidence is out, we know.
[00:54:43.881 --> 00:54:50.266]  And I don't care if the news says I'm a liar and there's not spider goats or genetic engineering or that I didn't kill them the rats they feed it to.
[00:54:50.726 --> 00:54:55.669]  I'm going to keep telling the truth and we're going to keep showing they're a pack of liars and they're trying to shut the web down right now.
[00:54:55.929 --> 00:54:57.390]  But I'm telling you, it's too little too late.
[00:54:58.771 --> 00:55:01.373]  Well, I have a few more things if it's alright.
[00:55:01.693 --> 00:55:02.054]  Go ahead.
[00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:08.278]  I found out, and I'm sure everyone else knows, I'm not the genius here.
[00:55:09.013 --> 00:55:36.248]  But I found out the number one problem is we, the people, or me, Kim, because, uh, and I think other people are waking up, I'm sorry, we're waking up to the fact that we're the problem, because all these problems, and they're infinite, is a reflection of ourself, and we're waking up to that fact, and now that we are, we're going to do something about it, and the moment we start talking to each other about solutions,
[00:55:37.031 --> 00:55:44.237]  This country and the world will change literally, not literally, but figuratively speaking, overnight.
[00:55:44.477 --> 00:55:49.141]  Oh yeah, they know we want... I don't believe that this year is the change coming on.
[00:55:49.462 --> 00:55:53.785]  Oh yeah, they know we want... Everything is full of fear constantly because they don't want us to know.
[00:55:54.226 --> 00:55:58.670]  And they're terrified, like David Axe said, but they're terrified of us.
[00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:03.073]  Because let me assure you, and everyone knows this, I'm not Mr. Expert,
[00:56:04.221 --> 00:56:09.284]  We the people made this country great, not that handful of rich elite.
[00:56:09.924 --> 00:56:10.584]  Absolutely.
[00:56:11.805 --> 00:56:14.246]  That's all I have to say and I thank you, Alex.
[00:56:14.826 --> 00:56:15.687]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[00:56:15.707 --> 00:56:17.328]  I really appreciate that call, Ken.
[00:56:18.482 --> 00:56:23.285]  No, I totally agree with Ken, and we all hang together, we all hang separate.
[00:56:23.305 --> 00:56:25.127]  In fact, I wrote a bunch of notes last night.
[00:56:25.167 --> 00:56:26.868]  You know, I get reflective late at night.
[00:56:27.548 --> 00:56:33.653]  I've not really ever been a morning person, but I get up at like 6.30, 7 in the morning, and then I always kind of wake up by 5.00, 6.00 at night.
[00:56:34.193 --> 00:56:35.634]  I'm going to buy an audio recorder.
[00:56:36.114 --> 00:56:38.576]  David, don't we have that one I bought to do interviews we never use?
[00:56:38.956 --> 00:56:39.577]  It's kind of big.
[00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:47.095]  I want to start having that at home at night, because that's when I really want to have clear thoughts.
[00:56:47.735 --> 00:56:57.943]  I'm going to start doing a little 10-minute show maybe every day that's just an upload of that audio, because I've got a big list of things I want to go over today, and I've got to cover that too.
[00:56:58.864 --> 00:56:59.544]  So stay with us.
[00:57:00.425 --> 00:57:03.768]  Mark, Dave, Justin, stay with us.
[00:57:03.828 --> 00:57:05.309]  Corby, stay with us.
[00:57:06.989 --> 00:57:21.941]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash, Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:24.523]  Between now and January 20, 2009, all food units U1 through UC1
[00:57:27.125 --> 00:57:27.585]  I think so.
[00:57:47.045 --> 00:57:50.707]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:57:51.307 --> 00:57:52.728]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:15.293 --> 00:58:16.294]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:16.834 --> 00:58:17.335]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:17.635 --> 00:58:18.596]  This is his M.O.
[00:58:18.616 --> 00:58:19.937]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:19.997 --> 00:58:21.658]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:28.744]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:29.144 --> 00:58:29.584]  Some U.S.
[00:58:29.624 --> 00:58:35.289]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:35.969 --> 00:58:39.450]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:42.271]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:59:08.396 --> 00:59:11.078]  How would you like to save up to 90% on your phone bill?

[01:00:15.856 --> 01:00:16.677]  You want answers?
[01:00:17.437 --> 01:00:18.358]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:18.378 --> 01:00:22.661]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:23.201 --> 01:00:27.264]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.466 --> 01:00:38.727]  All right, we are back live.
[01:00:38.767 --> 01:00:42.989]  We have 51 and a half minutes left in this final transmission of 2008.
[01:00:43.469 --> 01:01:00.478]  I want to go to Mark, Dave, Justin, Corby, and others, but before I do that, I need to get to this body snatcher clip first before we run out of time here, and at least get to some of the news in a little bit more detail, then we'll take calls for the balance of the transmission.
[01:01:01.627 --> 01:01:11.382]  Last hour, I was talking about genetic engineering and the fact that aspartame is the fecal matter of a type of genetically engineered E. coli bacteria.
[01:01:11.722 --> 01:01:13.405]  Now, they came up with this in the 60s.
[01:01:13.485 --> 01:01:16.269]  The Army came up with this in the 1960s.
[01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:20.311]  Now, I mean, is that not body-snatcher-esque?
[01:01:21.792 --> 01:01:30.716]  I mean, we have our own criminal species, psychopath control freaks, power-hungry nuts, nihilistic people, running the world government.
[01:01:30.756 --> 01:01:33.237]  They openly admit that they're eugenicists.
[01:01:33.317 --> 01:01:38.920]  They openly admit that they want to reduce world population by at least 80 to 90 percent, depending on which document you look at.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:41.881]  United Nations Biological Diversity Assessments and others.
[01:01:44.282 --> 01:01:45.163]  State Department Morandum 200.
[01:01:48.696 --> 01:01:53.318]  And Dr. Eric Bianca has these standing ovations where he says, kill 90% of us.
[01:01:53.398 --> 01:01:55.499]  And the issue is the standing ovation.
[01:01:55.539 --> 01:01:56.960]  The scientists are crying.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.120]  It's on the news.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.061]  Oh, yes, kill everyone.
[01:01:59.161 --> 01:02:00.161]  Oh, so beautiful.
[01:02:00.361 --> 01:02:03.983]  While he projects a PowerPoint with a bunch of human skulls behind him.
[01:02:04.363 --> 01:02:14.308]  And then, as I said earlier, his graduate students, when I talked bad about him and it broke the national news a few years ago, he's just one of thousands of these guys, sent me threatening emails and saying, here's my graduate paper.
[01:02:14.588 --> 01:02:15.848]  I believe humans are a parasite.
[01:02:15.888 --> 01:02:17.069]  We should all be gotten rid of.
[01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:21.915]  And then I would search their name and it'd be them in a bioweapons lab in a white coat on the website.
[01:02:22.256 --> 01:02:24.238]  And it's like, my God, these people are in control of that.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.723]  They want to kill us and they're in bioweapons labs.
[01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:33.490]  And they're building 36 level 4 bioweapons labs under BioShield.
[01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:41.573]  They know that potatoes they approved 15-20 years ago were killing the guinea pigs and rats they fed them to.
[01:02:42.013 --> 01:02:48.276]  They know the aspartame killed at least half of the baby monkeys they gave it to when they approved it back in the eighties.
[01:02:48.336 --> 01:02:52.979]  They knew Prozac caused massive increases in suicide and psychopathic activities.
[01:02:53.819 --> 01:02:55.160]  Now we force them to put it on the label.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:56.880]  It'll stop your depression.
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:57.901]  It'll make you want to kill your family.
[01:02:58.261 --> 01:02:59.762]  It'll make you want to go shoot the school up.
[01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:01.343]  All of this is going on.
[01:03:01.383 --> 01:03:03.664]  This is diabolical by design.
[01:03:04.671 --> 01:03:15.816]  And when you know this, I feel like the guy, you know, the doctor in Body Snatchers, where, you know, he goes in and starts telling the police department, listen, something is going on.
[01:03:16.856 --> 01:03:17.977]  Something bad is happening.
[01:03:18.717 --> 01:03:23.839]  That's how folks felt in Nazi Germany when it was leading up to it, you know, to the really bad times in the late 30s, early 40s.
[01:03:24.419 --> 01:03:25.800]  That's how people throughout history feel.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:42.453]  And, you know, this is an analogy, but the crises they face, that we face in the real world, are comparable, but it's our own species who believes, the elite believe they're a new species, they believe eugenics, that they're going to make this god race.
[01:03:42.953 --> 01:03:44.314]  It's the brave new world system.
[01:03:44.434 --> 01:03:46.276]  That's what the UN has said they want.
[01:03:47.196 --> 01:03:51.400]  And they believe it's their right to kill us, they believe it's their right to
[01:03:52.950 --> 01:04:06.278]  To euthanize us, to sterilize us, as they've been caught adding sterilization compounds to the tetanus shots worldwide, and the HIV's been declassified, you know, bioweapon as part of the advanced cancer warfare program in the seventies.
[01:04:07.238 --> 01:04:08.019]  It's a cancer virus.
[01:04:08.639 --> 01:04:10.080]  All of this is going on.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:15.603]  It's just a cancer virus that attacks telemphysites, which are basically the generals or the commanders of your white blood cells.
[01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:17.444]  You know, they go out and command the forces.
[01:04:17.504 --> 01:04:18.645]  They program everybody.
[01:04:20.169 --> 01:04:21.550]  And we know this is going on.
[01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:24.293]  We know they're already using soft kill weapons on us.
[01:04:24.653 --> 01:04:28.096]  We know we've gone from 1 in 33 with cancer 50 years ago to 1 in 3.
[01:04:29.017 --> 01:04:35.202]  We know we've gone from 1 in 500, depending on the study, higher with diabetes to now 1 in 5.
[01:04:35.942 --> 01:04:39.645]  We know that our life expectancy has gone down.
[01:04:41.522 --> 01:04:44.324]  Infant mortality has gone down.
[01:04:45.045 --> 01:04:54.111]  There's been less of that, so if you take that out of the equation, the fact that babies survive more often, in the past around a third of the children would die, then you know we're living about 15 years less on average.
[01:04:55.432 --> 01:05:03.038]  All of this is happening and I go to urban warfare drills 12 years ago, 11 years ago, 10 years ago.
[01:05:03.478 --> 01:05:07.942]  I witnessed Marines with role players hired in California, in Maryland,
[01:05:09.522 --> 01:05:16.287]  All over the country people send me footage from everywhere with Marines walking up with machine guns telling people turn your cameras off.
[01:05:17.087 --> 01:05:20.970]  Then the local news says oh it's just a drill but then they're actually arresting people in the town.
[01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:30.377]  They're working with the local Boy Scouts to tattle on their neighbors and do mock gun confiscations and the local Boy Scouts on video go out and help identify militia members.
[01:05:31.812 --> 01:05:33.874]  And they have role players playing the part of U.S.
[01:05:33.914 --> 01:05:34.454]  patriots.
[01:05:34.614 --> 01:05:39.158]  And then I bring you the footage of all of this and people can't believe it.
[01:05:39.338 --> 01:05:40.539]  Oh no, that's fake footage.
[01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:44.763]  You know, those helicopters landing and those troop carrying ships and those thousands of Marines.
[01:05:45.123 --> 01:05:45.744]  That's fake!
[01:05:47.358 --> 01:05:53.523]  Now they announce, oh yes, we're going to put 20,000 Army and 5,000 Marines and just a star on the streets.
[01:05:53.563 --> 01:05:57.667]  And yes, under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, it's to engage the American people.
[01:05:57.907 --> 01:06:01.890]  And the Army War College comes out and says, our new rules of engagement is to fight the American people.
[01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:03.732]  NORTHCOM is a theater of operations.
[01:06:05.285 --> 01:06:07.546]  Madoff has stolen close to a hundred billion.
[01:06:08.406 --> 01:06:13.667]  Turns out he's a front man for big banks, all the big banks, all the big banks are involved.
[01:06:14.648 --> 01:06:15.868]  It's all a Ponzi scheme.
[01:06:16.048 --> 01:06:20.589]  Social Security is, you know, the new money pays for the people that first invested.
[01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:22.150]  Everything's a fraud.
[01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:27.272]  Wall Street set up the CIA in 1947 out of the Ivy League.
[01:06:27.412 --> 01:06:33.454]  They openly set it up to bring in narcotics, to launder the money, to run these scams, fractional reserve banking.
[01:06:33.774 --> 01:06:36.015]  These private families issue the currency.
[01:06:36.615 --> 01:06:37.535]  They control everything.
[01:06:37.775 --> 01:06:39.656]  They're telling Congress we're under martial law.
[01:06:40.356 --> 01:06:46.539]  Bloomberg has the headline that War Powers Act has been declared and that Congress is now under martial law.
[01:06:47.959 --> 01:06:50.280]  And people just go on about their business like it's normal!
[01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:59.527]  So let's go ahead and play this clip from the 1950s Body Snatchers right here from YouTube.
[01:06:59.627 --> 01:07:02.409]  I suggest you go to Netflix or somewhere else and buy the film.
[01:07:02.729 --> 01:07:07.633]  I actually got it on DVD somewhere, but I was rummaging around last night and couldn't find it, so I just got to YouTube.
[01:07:08.293 --> 01:07:09.014]  But here it is.
[01:07:31.765 --> 01:07:32.465]  Oh, Dr. Hill?
[01:07:32.505 --> 01:07:33.026]  Dr. Bassett?
[01:07:34.506 --> 01:07:35.126]  Oh, where's the patient?
[01:07:35.867 --> 01:07:37.867]  I hated to drag you out of bed at this time of night.
[01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.688]  Could you let me go while there's still time?
[01:07:40.028 --> 01:07:41.188]  You'll soon see why I did.
[01:07:41.208 --> 01:07:47.150]  Will you tell these fools I'm not crazy?
[01:07:47.451 --> 01:07:49.111]  Make them listen to me before it's too late!
[01:07:49.651 --> 01:07:50.392]  I'll listen to you.
[01:07:51.892 --> 01:07:52.312]  Let him go.
[01:07:52.332 --> 01:07:52.992]  Who are you?
[01:07:58.004 --> 01:08:00.446]  I'm Dr. Hill from the State Mental Hospital.
[01:08:00.486 --> 01:08:01.847]  I'm not insane!
[01:08:01.867 --> 01:08:03.528]  Let him go!
[01:08:04.528 --> 01:08:04.809]  Doctor!
[01:08:05.649 --> 01:08:06.750]  Now, you must listen to me.
[01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:07.931]  You must understand me.
[01:08:08.591 --> 01:08:09.392]  I'm a doctor, too.
[01:08:09.532 --> 01:08:10.372]  I am not insane.
[01:08:10.512 --> 01:08:11.513]  I am not insane.
[01:08:11.973 --> 01:08:15.676]  Now, suppose we just sit down over here, Dr. Vanell, and you tell me what happened.
[01:08:19.699 --> 01:08:21.560]  Well, it started.
[01:08:22.701 --> 01:08:24.122]  For me, it started last Thursday.
[01:08:24.222 --> 01:08:27.444]  In response to an urgent message from my nurse.
[01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:31.067]  I hurried home from a medical convention I'd been attending.
[01:08:32.569 --> 01:08:35.352]  At first glance, everything looked the same.
[01:08:37.335 --> 01:08:37.735]  It wasn't.
[01:08:39.557 --> 01:08:41.780]  Something evil had taken possession of the town.
[01:08:43.682 --> 01:08:43.983]  These two.
[01:08:45.402 --> 01:08:47.243]  Alright, so that's the intro.
[01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:50.784]  Now, again, people who know me in person, I'm a calm, nice, friendly guy.
[01:08:51.124 --> 01:08:53.025]  I start thinking about, my God, it's all real.
[01:08:53.045 --> 01:08:53.765]  There's FEMA camps.
[01:08:53.825 --> 01:08:54.426]  I've been to them.
[01:08:54.446 --> 01:08:57.747]  You know, they've been training for years to put us in camps and take our guns.
[01:08:57.767 --> 01:08:59.207]  They're putting poison in the food.
[01:08:59.247 --> 01:09:06.810]  I mean, it's abnormal to not freak out like a human, a homo sapien, and say, look out, man, we've got a problem.
[01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:07.270]  Come on.
[01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:08.731]  I mean, that's what we do.
[01:09:08.791 --> 01:09:11.632]  That's what your dog does as a mammal when somebody comes to the door.
[01:09:11.812 --> 01:09:13.473]  They hop around, they get upset, you know.
[01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:15.714]  I mean, I'm normal, folks.
[01:09:15.814 --> 01:09:17.655]  It's abnormal to not be upset about this.
[01:09:18.375 --> 01:09:21.997]  Now, that's from the beginning of the film, and I'm not going to tell you how it ends.
[01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:25.339]  Here is next to the end, though, and this is how I feel a lot of days.
[01:09:25.959 --> 01:09:26.720]  And this is what I want to do.
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.781]  I want to run down the street, because this is really a normal behavior.
[01:09:30.081 --> 01:09:32.923]  See, we've just been eased into accepting it.
[01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:35.584]  Oh, be calm about it, Alex, and people will listen to you.
[01:09:35.904 --> 01:09:36.425]  Bull!
[01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:40.447]  We've been the most effective out there, and we're not perfect, but we're still the most effective.
[01:09:41.104 --> 01:09:47.666]  It's kind of scary, because we are able to reach out to people with the intellectual evidence, but also we say, hey man, what's in here?
[01:09:48.246 --> 01:09:49.607]  This is serious business!
[01:09:50.167 --> 01:09:52.088]  Our species is under threat right now.
[01:09:53.388 --> 01:10:01.511]  We've got a bunch of criminal control freaks who just love crapping all over everything, because they like to play God in control, and they've got to be stopped right now.
[01:10:01.871 --> 01:10:09.814]  And they're stopped when you wake up and admit the ambient nightmare has been turned up quietly, when you weren't paying attention, and now it's just at a crescendo.
[01:10:10.134 --> 01:10:10.474]  Here it is.
[01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:14.556]  I've been afraid a lot of times in my life.
[01:10:15.616 --> 01:10:20.198]  But I didn't know the real meaning of fear until... until I had kissed Becky.
[01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:26.240]  A moment's sleep and the girl I loved was an inhuman enemy bent on my destruction.
[01:10:27.201 --> 01:10:32.243]  That moment's sleep was death to Becky's soul, just as it had been for Jack and Teddy and Dan Kaufman and all the rest.
[01:10:32.916 --> 01:10:40.221]  Their bodies were now hosts harboring an alien form of life, a cosmic form, which to survive must take over every human man.
[01:10:40.641 --> 01:10:41.682]  So I ran, I ran.
[01:10:42.282 --> 01:10:44.223]  I ran as little Jimmy Grimaldi had run the other day.
[01:10:44.984 --> 01:10:51.008]  My only hope was to get away from Santa Mira, to get to the highway, to warn the others of what was happening.
[01:11:02.221 --> 01:11:02.582]  Wait!
[01:11:02.742 --> 01:11:02.842]  No!
[01:11:03.122 --> 01:11:07.204]  No, we gotta get out!
[01:11:07.244 --> 01:11:08.425]  No, wait, let him go.
[01:11:08.445 --> 01:11:09.286]  They'll never believe you.
[01:11:13.873 --> 01:11:14.193]  Help!
[01:11:14.573 --> 01:11:15.073]  Help!
[01:11:15.093 --> 01:11:15.373]  Help!
[01:11:15.553 --> 01:11:15.913]  Wait!
[01:11:16.513 --> 01:11:16.733]  Help!
[01:11:16.893 --> 01:11:17.153]  Help!
[01:11:17.333 --> 01:11:17.433]  Help!
[01:11:17.493 --> 01:11:17.713]  Wait!
[01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:18.053]  Wait!
[01:11:18.153 --> 01:11:18.414]  Stop!
[01:11:18.434 --> 01:11:18.574]  Stop!
[01:11:18.594 --> 01:11:19.834]  Stop and listen to me!
[01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:20.594]  Listen to me!
[01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:21.014]  Listen!
[01:11:21.034 --> 01:11:21.394]  Listen!
[01:11:21.494 --> 01:11:26.055]  Those people that are coming after me, they're not human!
[01:11:26.095 --> 01:11:26.755]  Listen to me!
[01:11:26.855 --> 01:11:27.795]  We're in danger!
[01:11:27.855 --> 01:11:28.415]  Danger!
[01:11:28.656 --> 01:11:28.916]  Come on!
[01:11:28.936 --> 01:11:30.976]  Get out of here!
[01:11:31.116 --> 01:11:32.576]  You're in danger!
[01:11:32.656 --> 01:11:33.636]  Please!
[01:11:33.897 --> 01:11:35.377]  Get out of here!
[01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:41.356]  Now listen, listen to me!
[01:11:41.436 --> 01:11:45.677]  There isn't a human being left inside of me!
[01:11:46.457 --> 01:11:46.977]  Not one!
[01:11:47.057 --> 01:11:47.377]  Hey!
[01:11:47.417 --> 01:11:47.897]  Hey, stop!
[01:11:48.177 --> 01:11:48.897]  Pull up, will you?
[01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.898]  Pull over to the side of the road!
[01:11:51.998 --> 01:11:54.319]  I need your help!
[01:11:54.379 --> 01:11:56.779]  Something terrible has happened!
[01:11:56.819 --> 01:11:57.579]  Go on, you drunk!
[01:11:57.599 --> 01:11:59.120]  Get out of the street!
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.200]  Get out of here!
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:00.540]  Go on!
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.520]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:12:07.953 --> 01:12:08.993]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:12:09.394 --> 01:12:14.875]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:15.956]  That's right.
[01:12:16.276 --> 01:12:18.497]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:12:20.017 --> 01:12:26.079]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:12:26.599 --> 01:12:34.222]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:39.592]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:12:40.212 --> 01:12:45.635]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:46.015 --> 01:12:50.156]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:12:50.537 --> 01:12:50.797]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:50.817 --> 01:12:52.738]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:12:52.798 --> 01:12:53.098]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:53.398 --> 01:12:53.678]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:05.945 --> 01:13:07.988]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:13:08.108 --> 01:13:10.531]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:13:10.551 --> 01:13:13.134]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:13:13.154 --> 01:13:14.335]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:13:14.355 --> 01:13:15.977]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:13:16.057 --> 01:13:18.861]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[01:13:18.881 --> 01:13:23.907]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the UNICEF.
[01:13:32.239 --> 01:13:37.128]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:13:40.888 --> 01:13:42.029]  How dare you?
[01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:48.375]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:13:48.395 --> 01:13:51.017]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:13:51.097 --> 01:13:57.482]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:14:50.028 --> 01:14:50.308]  Call 903-356-6443.
[01:14:53.229 --> 01:14:56.311]  That's 903-356-6443.
[01:14:56.651 --> 01:14:57.491]  Open from 9 a.m.
[01:14:57.511 --> 01:14:58.212]  to 6 p.m.
[01:14:58.252 --> 01:14:59.232]  Central Standard Time.
[01:14:59.492 --> 01:15:02.494]  Or shop online at internet-grocer.net.
[01:15:02.754 --> 01:15:05.335]  Again, that's internet-grocer.net.
[01:15:05.695 --> 01:15:08.757]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:15:09.197 --> 01:15:12.519]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:15:12.979 --> 01:15:18.902]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:23.426]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:15:23.926 --> 01:15:29.631]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:15:29.931 --> 01:15:32.933]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:15:34.955 --> 01:15:35.636]  I think so.
[01:15:56.392 --> 01:15:57.212]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:15:57.232 --> 01:15:57.312]  877-327-0365.
[01:15:57.353 --> 01:15:57.853]  Don't wait.
[01:15:57.893 --> 01:15:58.773]  Call today.
[01:15:58.833 --> 01:15:59.113]  Hey!
[01:15:59.173 --> 01:15:59.713]  Hey, stop!
[01:15:59.753 --> 01:16:01.974]  Pull over to the side of the road!
[01:16:01.994 --> 01:16:02.775]  I need your help!
[01:16:02.795 --> 01:16:05.176]  Something terrible has happened!
[01:16:06.496 --> 01:16:08.557]  Come on, you drunk!
[01:16:08.637 --> 01:16:11.758]  Get out of the street!
[01:16:11.838 --> 01:16:13.499]  Get out of here!
[01:16:13.579 --> 01:16:14.139]  Come on!
[01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:24.566]  Alright.
[01:16:52.088 --> 01:16:57.351]  Now, again, we're not saying aliens are here, but you can say in a spiritual sense it came on the solar winds.
[01:16:58.492 --> 01:17:00.694]  I mean, it is a spiritual thing.
[01:17:00.734 --> 01:17:02.875]  I mean, you can call it group consciousness, whatever.
[01:17:02.915 --> 01:17:03.936]  There are evil people.
[01:17:04.356 --> 01:17:08.218]  There are people who enjoy death and destruction, enjoy control, hate goodness.
[01:17:08.619 --> 01:17:13.422]  They love their genetic engineering, they love mutating it, and they love the fact that the public's poisoned.
[01:17:13.902 --> 01:17:16.063]  And that's like being at a body snatcher convention.
[01:17:16.944 --> 01:17:20.266]  Here in Austin, when Dr. Eric Pionko gave a speech at St.
[01:17:20.326 --> 01:17:21.087]  Edward's University.
[01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:22.557]  You know, to be there.
[01:17:23.017 --> 01:17:26.778]  And to see 90 plus percent standing ovation when he said we have to kill 90 percent.
[01:17:27.118 --> 01:17:29.318]  And people just, oh yeah, oh, kill everyone!
[01:17:29.618 --> 01:17:31.899]  See, it's a petty, demonic power trip they're on.
[01:17:32.359 --> 01:17:35.740]  And then the Texas Academy of Sciences, 95 percent standing ovation.
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.740]  Tears, three minute standing ovation.
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.060]  Oh, because it's about their petty power.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:48.662]  It's about, oh my God, I'm a member of the elite, I'm a smart scientist, I know what's best, I know it's all about survival of the fittest, we are a poison, oh, I must kill everyone.
[01:17:49.062 --> 01:17:51.985]  You know, it's just this pressing on the nerve of power.
[01:17:52.305 --> 01:17:54.027]  These are very sick, wicked people.
[01:17:54.347 --> 01:17:55.368]  We are not a parasite.
[01:17:55.408 --> 01:17:56.228]  We are not a cancer.
[01:17:56.409 --> 01:18:03.415]  We are a wondrous, incredible species that's going to go to the stars if you control freak pieces of filth don't stop us.
[01:18:05.076 --> 01:18:05.977]  And you probably will.
[01:18:06.017 --> 01:18:07.518]  You're just absolute garbage.
[01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:08.980]  And you don't care about the environment.
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:09.800]  Shut up!
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.820]  I'm sick of your lies!
[01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:16.422]  You don't care about any real environmental issues and crises that we're facing.
[01:18:16.462 --> 01:18:22.043]  You want your fake carbon tax to tax all human activity so you control freaks can run everybody's lives.
[01:18:22.724 --> 01:18:26.025]  And all the genetic splicing and chimeras and cross-human...
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:34.948]  Uh, hybrids and all the big pharmacological crops and all the crises and all of it.
[01:18:34.988 --> 01:18:36.790]  You don't care about any of the real issues.
[01:18:37.291 --> 01:18:39.693]  The toxic waste dumping, the chopping down rain forest.
[01:18:40.134 --> 01:18:43.698]  It's all about stealing property here in the US and controlling the western world.
[01:18:44.078 --> 01:18:45.980]  They revel in destroying the environment.
[01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:49.023]  And they might as well be body snatchers from outer space.
[01:18:49.043 --> 01:18:50.083]  They want the same thing.
[01:18:50.504 --> 01:18:57.408]  To eradicate humanity and our liberty and our freedom and create some weird cyborg biological android.
[01:18:57.428 --> 01:19:01.070]  A few hundred million of us, that's their current plan, that they control.
[01:19:01.331 --> 01:19:04.893]  All the elite gets all the life extension technologies and everything else in place.
[01:19:04.993 --> 01:19:05.493]  God!
[01:19:05.713 --> 01:19:07.695]  And they already believe they're another species from us.
[01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:11.117]  They say we're weak because we don't know how to kill masses of people.
[01:19:11.457 --> 01:19:16.922]  They say they're scientifically minded and they understand we're all just animals and it's a cold, hard decision they have to make.
[01:19:17.142 --> 01:19:20.164]  Well listen, you pieces of trash then, kill yourselves!
[01:19:20.524 --> 01:19:22.406]  Kill yourselves if humans are so bad!
[01:19:22.866 --> 01:19:23.247]  Okay?
[01:19:23.667 --> 01:19:27.310]  Look, as for me and mine, we ain't going nowhere and we will fight you!
[01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:29.852]  You understand that, you little pieces of trash?
[01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:34.196]  We're not going quietly into the night, we're not backing off and we're not shutting up!
[01:19:34.696 --> 01:19:35.857]  And we're not weak-minded.
[01:19:35.917 --> 01:19:37.057]  We know who you are.
[01:19:37.117 --> 01:19:40.339]  We see who you are better than you see who you are yourselves.
[01:19:40.599 --> 01:19:41.880]  We understand your mind.
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:43.040]  We see your soul.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:54.566]  I look right through your skin, right into your bones, and you know it and you don't like it because you're a bunch of control freaks, small-minded nobodies hung up on petty power.
[01:19:55.919 --> 01:20:08.507]  You don't know what it truly is to be part of this species, to be part of the depth and breadth of humanity, and the endless chain going back into our development, and how special that is, and how this is only the beginning of what humanity is going to be.
[01:20:08.827 --> 01:20:14.551]  If you just don't stand in the way of it, you know how I know you're an evil elite?
[01:20:14.971 --> 01:20:20.875]  Not just all the evidence, the fact that you revel in poisoning and dumbing the population down to make people more manageable.
[01:20:22.642 --> 01:20:23.042]  You don't care.
[01:20:23.223 --> 01:20:24.664]  It's not survival of the fittest.
[01:20:24.744 --> 01:20:25.725]  You're cancer.
[01:20:25.945 --> 01:20:28.728]  You're not some new species or some elite group.
[01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:30.110]  You're cancer.
[01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:31.992]  And you're not winning anything.
[01:20:32.012 --> 01:20:34.054]  You're destroying what you're part of.
[01:20:36.155 --> 01:20:43.219]  I mean, how dare you put sodium fluoride in the water, knowing the Soviets and the Nazis put it in the water to control people at labor camps?
[01:20:43.279 --> 01:20:48.922]  How dare you rob hundreds of millions of people of their intellects, their IQs?
[01:20:49.683 --> 01:20:53.425]  That is just an unbelievable crime against creativity and humanity.
[01:20:54.065 --> 01:20:55.485]  I rejoice in humanity.
[01:20:55.565 --> 01:20:58.466]  I rejoice in sharing knowledge and information with others.
[01:20:58.746 --> 01:21:00.567]  I rejoice in seeing others do well.
[01:21:00.847 --> 01:21:04.847]  It's like watching a twelve-month-old baby take its first step.
[01:21:05.408 --> 01:21:09.529]  I just love creativity and invention, science and ideas.
[01:21:09.829 --> 01:21:14.210]  But you take it all and you mutate it and you use it for your own selfish aims.
[01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:15.330]  I know your heart.
[01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:20.080]  I know the elite, these old degenerate men and women, they hate young, beautiful people.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.621]  They hate good people who have beautiful souls.
[01:21:22.981 --> 01:21:24.582]  They think we're stupid.
[01:21:24.842 --> 01:21:25.802]  They laugh at us.
[01:21:26.022 --> 01:21:28.583]  They make jokes about us that we care about our fellow man.
[01:21:30.304 --> 01:21:33.505]  You are not strong because you're greedy and only care about yourself.
[01:21:33.545 --> 01:21:34.306]  You are weak!
[01:21:34.706 --> 01:21:35.526]  You are weak!
[01:21:36.346 --> 01:21:37.227]  Let me just tell you something.
[01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:38.747]  Humanity will defeat you.
[01:21:38.988 --> 01:21:41.989]  With God's help, we are going to stop your New World Order.
[01:21:43.206 --> 01:21:49.629]  And for those of you out there mesmerized by television under the enemy's mind control, break your conditioning now in your guts!
[01:21:49.929 --> 01:21:51.070]  You know I'm telling you the truth.
[01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:53.931]  And intellectually, you can check the facts out for yourself.
[01:21:54.211 --> 01:21:55.392]  JOIN HUMANITY!
[01:21:56.393 --> 01:21:57.293]  We're on the march.
[01:21:57.773 --> 01:21:59.374]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:03.016]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:06.198 --> 01:22:09.819]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:22:09.899 --> 01:22:15.501]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:22:15.621 --> 01:22:19.682]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:22:19.962 --> 01:22:22.242]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:22:22.422 --> 01:22:28.324]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:22:28.404 --> 01:22:28.885]  I don't know.
[01:22:45.623 --> 01:22:50.587]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:22:50.647 --> 01:22:52.408]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:15.618 --> 01:23:16.618]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:17.659]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:18.919]  This is his ammo.
[01:23:18.939 --> 01:23:20.259]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:20.299 --> 01:23:21.920]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:29.062]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:29.462 --> 01:23:29.902]  Some U.S.
[01:23:29.942 --> 01:23:35.584]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:36.284 --> 01:23:39.745]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:41.946]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:06.815 --> 01:24:09.758]  Fuel prices are up and down, biting into everyone's budget.
[01:24:10.239 --> 01:24:13.743]  If you're ready to start saving at the pump, Fuel Saver technologies can help.
[01:24:14.023 --> 01:24:21.812]  With a small squeeze of our fuel conditioner in your gas tank, more of each gallon of fuel will combust, improving your fuel economy 10 to 20% or more.

[01:25:00.729 --> 01:25:02.730]  FuelSaverINC.com.
[01:25:02.970 --> 01:25:05.131]  Spend a little and save a lot!
[01:25:08.913 --> 01:25:17.777]  The masters of war... Build the big guns... Alright, I want to just go right back into your calls.
[01:25:18.277 --> 01:25:21.399]  Listen... Again, I'll just finish up with saying...
[01:25:25.336 --> 01:25:27.820]  Is that not invasion of the body snatchers?
[01:25:28.421 --> 01:25:35.731]  That when these professors, Pianca and Singer and others get up and say, we have to kill the majority of the public, humans are bad.
[01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:39.711]  That the scientific community stands up crying.
[01:25:40.071 --> 01:25:41.332]  See, that's body snatcher.
[01:25:41.692 --> 01:25:43.192]  Those people have lost their souls.
[01:25:43.733 --> 01:25:44.553]  That's what this is.
[01:25:44.613 --> 01:25:46.834]  They are just demon creatures.
[01:25:47.714 --> 01:25:56.578]  And they've got to be dealt with, folks, and they're in control, and we don't have any future until we first wake up the sheeple to what's going on, and then stop this New World Order.
[01:25:59.099 --> 01:26:00.760]  And I'm sorry the real world is this crazy.
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:01.260]  I'm sorry.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.881]  Listen, I've got to get
[01:26:05.612 --> 01:26:06.253]  To the news.
[01:26:06.573 --> 01:26:10.176]  They just brought me in the info and I was throwing stuff around on my desk.
[01:26:11.277 --> 01:26:15.500]  Former Trooper Charge was showing gun at KLBJ Studios.
[01:26:16.701 --> 01:26:20.484]  They did show up at our studios, the ones I do on the Sunday Syndicated Show.
[01:26:21.605 --> 01:26:22.986]  And by the way, we talked to the producer.
[01:26:23.407 --> 01:26:25.628]  When my name was brought up to him, that's when the gun came out.
[01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:28.731]  But thank God I wasn't there.
[01:26:31.593 --> 01:26:33.335]  So we got that circus going on.
[01:26:34.636 --> 01:26:38.437]  So now the police are showing up with guns, the former cop is.
[01:26:38.457 --> 01:26:40.677]  I'll tell you, I can't handle it.
[01:26:40.697 --> 01:26:42.078]  Stuff's getting too crazy around here.
[01:26:46.439 --> 01:26:55.141]  Okay, I've got to give you each only one minute because I've got to get this final news at the final 25 minutes of the show in the final year quickly.
[01:26:55.181 --> 01:26:57.701]  And I apologize, we've got to get to everybody here.
[01:26:57.841 --> 01:26:58.582]  It's a catch-22.
[01:26:58.862 --> 01:27:00.662]  Mark in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:27:01.442 --> 01:27:03.663]  First time caller, six years a listener.
[01:27:03.683 --> 01:27:04.183]  I thank you.
[01:27:04.930 --> 01:27:10.512]  Uh, to fight back with this food stuff, with these people, uh, raiding, uh, the cops raiding.
[01:27:11.433 --> 01:27:16.314]  If we set up the cops and we ambushed them, that would take care of them right now.
[01:27:16.935 --> 01:27:27.879]  The second thing is, for those, uh, fake preachers out there that you've warned us about, uh, they need to read Romans 13, 1 through 6, very carefully.
[01:27:27.899 --> 01:27:34.121]  Uh, God put the, God allowed the government to be put on this earth.
[01:27:34.998 --> 01:27:39.441]  And if God is good and he allowed it, then those governments have to be good.
[01:27:40.482 --> 01:27:47.846]  And if they're not good, then he does not expect us to listen to... No, and then you're supposed to rebel against it.
[01:27:48.727 --> 01:27:49.547]  Yes, we are.
[01:27:49.567 --> 01:27:57.472]  So therefore, whoever is listening now, read Romans 13 very slowly and closely.
[01:27:57.852 --> 01:27:59.554]  Do not listen to this government.
[01:27:59.994 --> 01:28:03.336]  Bush is not my president.
[01:28:04.008 --> 01:28:05.488]  And neither is Obama.
[01:28:06.129 --> 01:28:09.049]  Because they are bad.
[01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:10.530]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:14.551]  I noticed David D's illustration made an Obama one where they're, Obama!
[01:28:14.571 --> 01:28:16.991]  I mean, I went on record, I invented the Obama call.
[01:28:17.732 --> 01:28:19.012]  That's my coin then, I'm proud of that.
[01:28:19.352 --> 01:28:21.092]  Thank you, have a great New Year, Mark.
[01:28:22.413 --> 01:28:27.874]  You know, on the subject of ambushing the police, it's probably going to come to war.
[01:28:28.434 --> 01:28:29.595]  The new order doesn't know how to stop.
[01:28:32.236 --> 01:28:36.898]  I think it's better to just educate the people and have everybody say no to all this tyranny.
[01:28:40.259 --> 01:28:41.740]  Dave in California.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:42.980]  Dave, you're on the air.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:43.400]  Go ahead.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.181]  Happy New Year, brother.
[01:28:45.741 --> 01:28:46.441]  Happy New Year.
[01:28:47.362 --> 01:28:51.863]  And good riddance to 2008 and much greater success in 2009.
[01:28:52.344 --> 01:28:53.264]  Good riddance?
[01:28:53.604 --> 01:28:56.325]  I think looking back, I think we're going to see 2008 as a good year.
[01:28:56.345 --> 01:29:01.367]  I think 2009 is going to be downhill into the latrine.
[01:29:03.002 --> 01:29:05.784]  I think 09 is the slide into the sewer line.
[01:29:06.544 --> 01:29:08.025]  Well, you know, maybe it has to happen.
[01:29:08.045 --> 01:29:11.507]  You know, you've got to hit bottom before you can kick off and get back to the surface, man.
[01:29:11.527 --> 01:29:12.287]  I agree.
[01:29:12.808 --> 01:29:18.691]  But, you know, I love it when you rant, and I got a little rant, real fast one, for the New World Order leaders out there.
[01:29:18.951 --> 01:29:22.153]  You know, hey guys, we know who you are, okay?
[01:29:22.233 --> 01:29:23.794]  And we're not going to forget it.
[01:29:24.514 --> 01:29:26.015]  And you're threatening our children.
[01:29:26.375 --> 01:29:30.958]  You're threatening the lives of children that our children are supposed to have after us.
[01:29:31.485 --> 01:29:52.801]  You know, you've lied to us, you've stolen from us, you've swindled us, and buffaloed us, and bluffed us out, and illegally taxed us, and propagandized us, and fooled, and threatened, and purposely poisoned, and dumbed us down, and extorted us, and herded us, and blackmailed, and sold us a bill of goods, and you're trying to destroy us!
[01:29:54.082 --> 01:29:55.503]  And let me get this straight.
[01:29:56.508 --> 01:29:59.329]  We give bankers our money to hold for us.
[01:29:59.609 --> 01:30:05.451]  We pay them for the privilege of writing checks against our own money that they are, quote, holding for us.
[01:30:05.691 --> 01:30:13.554]  We pay penalties for any discrepancies in the monthly balance, and they take the money that they are, quote, holding for us.
[01:30:13.834 --> 01:30:16.515]  They loan it out up to ten times at interest.
[01:30:16.555 --> 01:30:18.236]  They invest it in shaky deals.
[01:30:18.276 --> 01:30:20.576]  They make ridiculously risky loans.
[01:30:21.097 --> 01:30:25.238]  They gamble in insurance scams against the money they've already gambled away.
[01:30:25.743 --> 01:30:54.863]  In horrible long-shot margin investments, they funnel off cash in a million different ways, they lose incredible amounts of fake money that they created from nothing out of our hard-earned money, and then, when they've created, squandered, stolen, gambled, mismanaged, and distributed all of this fake money to their cronies, plus all of these illegal taxes, they somehow
[01:30:55.410 --> 01:30:57.452]  That's right.
[01:30:57.472 --> 01:30:58.272]  I gotta jump.
[01:30:58.332 --> 01:30:59.793]  I appreciate your call.
[01:30:59.813 --> 01:31:01.815]  We gotta give everybody else time here.
[01:31:14.841 --> 01:31:31.333]  And not just that, we're not just on the hook for it, we're going to pay income tax for the foreign offshore banks at interest, and the bankers are going to be above Congress to declare the War Powers Act, that's mainstream news, and they will then set up world government that we pay taxes to for carbon tax, because it's for the earth.
[01:31:32.133 --> 01:31:38.077]  And we've got to watch idiot mainline liberals dance around, I'm for the earth, I'm for the earth, I pay a tax.
[01:31:38.277 --> 01:31:41.600]  You know, just cynical scam.
[01:31:43.166 --> 01:31:47.109]  We're going to go to Justin, Rich, and Chris before the transmission ends.
[01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:53.635]  I'm going to do a huge news blitz here in just a moment, but I wanted to bring Ted up right now for five minutes.
[01:31:54.475 --> 01:31:57.238]  At the deals Ted is offering, there's basically no profit.
[01:31:57.338 --> 01:31:59.780]  He bought gold last week when it was $770.
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:04.184]  This is the last day he was telling me he can do this, because it's now $890-something today.
[01:32:06.513 --> 01:32:09.295]  Yes, it's up over $120 from when he bought it last week.
[01:32:09.955 --> 01:32:18.419]  He's almost out of the Franks, the Sovereigns, I don't know if he has Buffaloes left, I've got to ask him, the American Eagles at that price.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.380]  Now, two weeks ago we were selling this for $700.
[01:32:20.421 --> 01:32:22.001]  Now it's $770 an ounce when it's $890.
[01:32:25.882 --> 01:32:25.902]  I
[01:32:43.928 --> 01:32:44.768]  A thousand, whatever.
[01:32:45.129 --> 01:32:48.790]  Now understand, everywhere else in the industry, gold is hard to find.
[01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:53.952]  Most places are sold out or you can only buy one coin and then there's a 20, 30, 40% markup on it.
[01:32:54.392 --> 01:32:54.912]  Not with Ted.
[01:32:54.972 --> 01:32:58.714]  You don't just get no markup above what spot is.
[01:33:00.174 --> 01:33:04.096]  You get the fact that he bought this when it was $120, less than it is now.
[01:33:08.154 --> 01:33:14.178]  And of course, you know, he bought with a little bit of a premium and, you know, has a 4% in there for the brokers or whatever, you know, to make the transaction.
[01:33:14.518 --> 01:33:22.963]  But no one can get even close to this, because he bought gold at the $770 level, a big position, a week and a half ago.
[01:33:23.083 --> 01:33:27.066]  Now it's $890, $885, $890, going back and forth.
[01:33:28.827 --> 01:33:30.628]  It's unheard of right around Christmas for this to happen.
[01:33:30.648 --> 01:33:31.549]  This is normally a slow time.
[01:33:33.250 --> 01:33:34.190]  Regardless, folks,
[01:33:35.959 --> 01:33:39.881]  Gold would have to drop by a hundred plus dollars an ounce for this to be a bad deal for you.
[01:33:41.062 --> 01:33:41.522]  You understand?
[01:33:41.863 --> 01:33:44.444]  And all the evidence shows the next year it's only going up.
[01:33:44.584 --> 01:33:46.586]  So get into gold and silver now.
[01:33:46.726 --> 01:33:47.926]  Do not procrastinate.
[01:33:48.207 --> 01:33:48.807]  Do not wait.
[01:33:49.427 --> 01:33:53.750]  Ted Anderson, tell folks the coin offer you've got today.
[01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:56.232]  Yeah, like you said Alex, gold is up another $10.
[01:33:57.552 --> 01:34:00.574]  I'm still offering the Franks the same price as yesterday, $2.05.
[01:34:02.075 --> 01:34:03.736]  I also have the British Sovereigns, $2.54.
[01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:09.293]  Now, people have to realize, when you're buying coins, nobody buys coins at spot.
[01:34:09.613 --> 01:34:13.275]  Not even when spot's at $7.70, it's a little higher than spot, just to get them.
[01:34:13.475 --> 01:34:15.136]  Even in the wholesale market, that's what it is.
[01:34:15.476 --> 01:34:21.780]  Well, when the spot price goes up, and I've already taken on a position, it eats up that premium, there's nothing left.
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:30.346]  That's why, if you call around the United States to other dealers to try to find these coins at these prices, you're not gonna, because nobody else has them at these prices.
[01:34:30.836 --> 01:34:34.358]  And then again, that Buffalo coin, I like that coin, too.
[01:34:34.899 --> 01:34:39.142]  And I'm just keeping it very limited because I know I'm just getting a little trickle of them coming in.
[01:34:39.522 --> 01:34:41.523]  But I will commit to doing another 50 today.
[01:34:42.224 --> 01:34:46.767]  And, you know, silver has been a hot item, too.
[01:34:46.827 --> 01:34:48.168]  Everybody's forgetting about silver.
[01:34:48.188 --> 01:34:51.130]  $11.15 an ounce today.
[01:34:51.650 --> 01:34:58.334]  And here we're looking at silver walking liberty halves, still at that $7.70 level, or in this case, right around $9.00.
[01:34:59.346 --> 01:34:59.667]  Thank you.
[01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:11.879]  Yeah, let's explain.
[01:35:11.919 --> 01:35:13.821]  People aren't just buying gold right now at the $885, $890 level.
[01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:17.146]  They're paying huge premiums because the dealers are having to pay that.
[01:35:17.166 --> 01:35:18.227]  You've been in business 30 years.
[01:35:29.941 --> 01:35:44.497]  You've never screwed any of these big international dealers, so you're able to get gold and silver when most people can't even get it, and you're buying big when you know it's down, so that you can give people huge savings as it goes up.
[01:35:44.557 --> 01:35:47.060]  But again, two weeks ago, you had people at a $704 position.
[01:35:49.022 --> 01:35:50.243]  Now it's at $770.
[01:35:50.603 --> 01:35:55.627]  Clearly next time we're going to be saying it's an $800 position and gold's $900 and something by now.
[01:35:56.148 --> 01:36:02.052]  He'll still have the deal for you next week, but it probably won't be this good the way everything's going with the dollar and the New World Order.
[01:36:02.873 --> 01:36:05.235]  Folks, the safest bet out there is gold and silver.
[01:36:05.275 --> 01:36:06.276]  Is it 100% safe?
[01:36:06.336 --> 01:36:10.759]  Is there any panacea or a paragon of everything being fine?
[01:36:10.819 --> 01:36:10.979]  No.
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:19.643]  But, this is what I believe in, this is where I would put my money, and you're insane if you don't put 20-30% of your liquid assets in gold and silver.
[01:36:20.543 --> 01:36:34.349]  Silver for the poor man is the best deal, that's what I've mainly invested in, and literally that's invested, you know, and I got that in a little vault at a bank, just so if the dollar becomes worthless, I can at least cash in the silver and pay my employees for a month, or maybe.
[01:36:34.369 --> 01:36:37.390]  You know, I mean, we're in an emergency situation.
[01:36:38.150 --> 01:36:48.715]  And Ted is the reason we have Midas Resources, we have Genesis, and that's why I've been having him up a lot lately, because this is one of the best solutions of independent wealth and protecting yourself out there that we know of.
[01:36:49.335 --> 01:36:50.996]  And, I mean, take the deal that Ted offered.
[01:36:52.012 --> 01:36:59.396]  I know that he pays $14 for The Creature from Jekyll Island, because I've called Jeb McGriffin about carrying it, and I never got around to it.
[01:36:59.436 --> 01:37:02.598]  Plus, you know, he wants 50% or 55% for his book.
[01:37:03.319 --> 01:37:05.420]  I know Ted has big pallets of it up at the office.
[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:06.180]  I've seen it up there.
[01:37:06.781 --> 01:37:10.383]  This is the big, you know, preeminent, big, thick book on the history of the Federal Reserve.
[01:37:10.683 --> 01:37:11.483]  A very good read.
[01:37:11.503 --> 01:37:12.644]  It's The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:37:13.384 --> 01:37:14.705]  Okay, Ted has that deal.
[01:37:16.126 --> 01:37:17.347]  The book sells for $25 in stores.
[01:37:19.813 --> 01:37:28.439]  Ted has that deal, and he gives you a silver dollar, which you're selling for 20-25 bucks everywhere, and the shipping for $26.
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.161]  Okay?
[01:37:30.461 --> 01:37:36.105]  So understand, Ted is losing, what, at least 15 bucks on that deal, Ted?
[01:37:36.385 --> 01:37:38.287]  Yeah, but it's an educational thing.
[01:37:38.327 --> 01:37:39.287]  People need to know this.
[01:37:39.387 --> 01:37:47.053]  Alex, what really makes me happy is we have sent out cases and cases and cases and cases and cases of these books.
[01:37:47.782 --> 01:37:51.425]  All over the United States and even across the world, people are waking up.
[01:37:52.006 --> 01:37:53.167]  That's the thing.
[01:37:53.207 --> 01:37:57.591]  That's why we have protests on the Federal Reserve System.
[01:37:57.611 --> 01:38:01.875]  That's why people understand now that the banking system is a... That's right.
[01:38:01.895 --> 01:38:07.019]  10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, there might be one lone guy out protesting a Fed and the cops would arrest him.
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:11.261]  At 38 locations, on average, about 200 people showed up.
[01:38:11.281 --> 01:38:12.982]  That's almost 6,000 people total.
[01:38:13.703 --> 01:38:16.664]  The one I went to had about 300 in Dallas.
[01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:20.126]  Again, the people are identifying the enemy.
[01:38:20.506 --> 01:38:24.248]  On C-SPAN, the Congress is saying, the private Federal Reserve is robbing us.
[01:38:24.268 --> 01:38:25.268]  You ran a scam.
[01:38:25.528 --> 01:38:26.809]  This is a Ponzi scheme.
[01:38:27.169 --> 01:38:30.070]  We have a chance of identifying the enemy and waking the public up.
[01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:33.132]  If you want the creature from Jekyll Island, silver dollar deal.
[01:38:33.852 --> 01:38:34.092]  I don't
[01:38:53.514 --> 01:38:56.696]  It's just, to me, that just makes me happy.
[01:38:56.876 --> 01:39:00.858]  So if somebody's watching this six months from now on a BitTorrent, that deal is still there.
[01:39:01.739 --> 01:39:10.604]  But just for today, until midnight, you have got those deals at gold at the $7.70 level, with gold right up at $8.90 right now, $800, $6.86, $2.00, $2.00, $3.00, $7.00.
[01:39:10.904 --> 01:39:14.326]  And again, you have 50 of the Buffalos first come, first served.
[01:39:14.346 --> 01:39:14.726]  Correct, Ted?
[01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:21.150]  Yep, yep, I will.
[01:39:21.170 --> 01:39:22.571]  I'll guarantee 50 coins.
[01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:24.272]  And you can't find these anywhere.
[01:39:24.452 --> 01:39:27.293]  I mean, I'm seeing these selling for $1,200, $1,300 a piece.
[01:39:27.954 --> 01:39:31.196]  One or two lots, if you can find them online or at a gold dealer shop.
[01:39:31.216 --> 01:39:32.116]  Believe me, I go around looking.
[01:39:32.477 --> 01:39:33.897]  Ted, tell them how much you got them for.
[01:39:34.258 --> 01:39:36.499]  Right now, I have the coin at $1,036.
[01:39:37.319 --> 01:39:41.062]  Now, mind you, gold has almost gone up 50 bucks since I offered them at that price, too.
[01:39:41.482 --> 01:39:45.063]  And let's explain, this is a premium on this, because you bought them for this.
[01:39:45.083 --> 01:39:48.643]  You're literally selling them at cost, as a loss leader here, folks.
[01:39:49.044 --> 01:39:49.424]  Okay?
[01:39:50.344 --> 01:39:57.985]  And now, pound for pound, ounce for ounce for gold, though, the Franks and the Sovereigns are the best deal to get at 800-686-2237.
[01:39:58.005 --> 01:40:01.326]  Yeah, they sure are.
[01:40:01.486 --> 01:40:03.566]  Plus, also, those Silver Walking Liberty halves.
[01:40:03.626 --> 01:40:11.288]  I mean, again, it's so important that people have small, fractional pieces of silver, and they have small, fractional pieces of gold.
[01:40:11.738 --> 01:40:22.360]  I mean, there are literally tens of thousands of people that have taken advantage of these offers here at Midas, and people that have done it in the past are looking at really nice, big
[01:40:22.765 --> 01:40:23.266]  Profits.
[01:40:23.546 --> 01:40:24.827]  But they don't even want the profits.
[01:40:24.847 --> 01:40:27.129]  They know they're buying it for insurance purposes.
[01:40:27.269 --> 01:40:27.810]  Absolutely.
[01:40:27.850 --> 01:40:28.690]  It's for security.
[01:40:28.710 --> 01:40:29.211]  800-686-223710.
[01:40:29.231 --> 01:40:33.114]  I want you to have a fantastic New Year.
[01:40:33.134 --> 01:40:37.478]  And again, is this deal held through midnight, or can people call on New Year's Day?
[01:40:37.498 --> 01:40:42.403]  They can call right through New Year's, and we'll keep it right on going, right through the business day on Friday.
[01:40:42.423 --> 01:40:45.786]  And if prices hold, and we can still do it, we'll do something with you then, too.
[01:40:46.326 --> 01:40:47.707]  Okay, because I got the idea earlier.
[01:40:47.747 --> 01:40:49.668]  Some days you say, no, this is it, this is the only day.
[01:40:49.888 --> 01:41:07.135]  There are times when the market's going up like it is and I know that supplies are getting tight for me and I've got to look at my next buy, you know, and I know the prices are up, then I have to raise them because I can't afford to pay for this radio network and do everything else I do and also sell the coins at a loss.
[01:41:07.455 --> 01:41:08.836]  You know, it's just not possible.
[01:41:09.398 --> 01:41:14.285]  And so, you know, I am bound to economic terms just like everybody else in business.
[01:41:14.425 --> 01:41:19.692]  Well, you know, I get so jam-packed with news early in the show that we end up having you on, you know, here at the end of the show.
[01:41:19.912 --> 01:41:24.058]  Next week I want to have you on in the first few hours of the show, but I wanted to have you on this week.
[01:41:24.558 --> 01:41:28.002]  With PrisonPlanet.tv viewers as well, because I believe in what you're doing.
[01:41:28.162 --> 01:41:31.004]  I happen to know the business now, after working with you for 12 years.
[01:41:31.024 --> 01:41:34.768]  I happen to know these are insane deals, and I just hope folks will take advantage of it.
[01:41:34.808 --> 01:41:37.851]  But that creature from Jekyll Island, I know you're paying 14 bucks a book for that.
[01:41:38.391 --> 01:41:39.653]  I know the silver dollars are what?
[01:41:39.693 --> 01:41:41.614]  How much are those silver dollars costing you, even in bulk, Ted?
[01:41:41.654 --> 01:41:45.378]  Well, in bulk right now, you're still... I mean, they're about 19, 20 bucks to get on.
[01:41:45.418 --> 01:41:46.479]  Okay, so let me be clear about this.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:48.121]  This is costing you...
[01:41:50.009 --> 01:41:53.874]  $30, $33 for the coin and the book.
[01:41:54.155 --> 01:41:58.481]  And we ship it through the post office, you know, Priority Mail, it's $6.
[01:41:58.721 --> 01:42:01.205]  And then that's $6, so you're talking a $37, $38 you're putting into this for $26.45.
[01:42:05.379 --> 01:42:07.400]  Yeah, but it's an educational thing, Alex.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.662]  People really need to wake up.
[01:42:09.682 --> 01:42:13.624]  You spent a hundred grand of your own money, didn't you, flying Ron Paul banners around.
[01:42:13.644 --> 01:42:17.286]  I mean, Ted is really giving you a great deal because he loves this audience.
[01:42:17.406 --> 01:42:18.927]  Other people don't get this deal when they call.
[01:42:19.147 --> 01:42:23.430]  He already has competitive deals, but this audience, tell them it's the radio deal, 800-686-2237.
[01:42:24.170 --> 01:42:27.232]  Get yourself a creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:42:27.252 --> 01:42:28.853]  Let's say you know all about the Federal Reserve.
[01:42:29.193 --> 01:42:34.657]  Give the book to somebody that reads, somebody in your family that you know will look at it, and then keep the silver dollar.
[01:42:35.137 --> 01:42:39.919]  I mean, you've basically gotten a good deal on the silver dollar and then gotten a free gift to give somebody to wake them up.
[01:42:39.999 --> 01:42:41.199]  That's how we defeat the enemy.
[01:42:41.239 --> 01:42:42.720]  And yes, this show needs capital.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.041]  Go to InfoWars.com and get the books and videos we offer there.
[01:42:46.381 --> 01:42:48.061]  We need your support and we can do more.
[01:42:48.341 --> 01:42:49.942]  Ted, have a great New Year, my friend.
[01:42:50.182 --> 01:42:50.782]  Yeah, you too, Alex.
[01:42:50.802 --> 01:42:52.143]  All right, I'm going to come back.
[01:42:52.543 --> 01:42:53.283]  Final segment.
[01:42:53.303 --> 01:42:55.764]  Dr. Justin Rich, Chris, stay with us.
[01:42:55.844 --> 01:42:57.905]  Final segment of the year.
[01:42:58.145 --> 01:42:58.725]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.985 --> 01:43:00.466]  Who will be the last caller of the year?
[01:43:00.486 --> 01:43:01.326]  Ha ha!
[01:43:06.559 --> 01:43:09.940]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:15.302]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:43:15.482 --> 01:43:20.264]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:43:20.644 --> 01:43:31.748]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:43:32.148 --> 01:43:37.712]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:43:37.932 --> 01:43:43.997]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:43:44.197 --> 01:43:44.857]  What about you?
[01:43:45.238 --> 01:43:51.282]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:44:08.897 --> 01:44:10.178]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:44:10.458 --> 01:44:12.439]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:44:12.599 --> 01:44:14.340]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:15.741]  The late great USA.
[01:44:16.001 --> 01:44:17.402]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:44:17.762 --> 01:44:24.605]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:10.976]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:45:11.176 --> 01:45:16.321]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:45:16.602 --> 01:45:21.687]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:45:21.987 --> 01:45:25.551]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:45:25.831 --> 01:45:27.552]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[01:45:27.872 --> 01:45:33.855]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:45:34.095 --> 01:45:37.637]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:45:37.877 --> 01:45:42.420]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:43.480]  Do your part.
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:46.022]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[01:45:46.362 --> 01:45:52.485]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[01:45:52.725 --> 01:45:53.545]  Hey, punch this up!
[01:45:53.585 --> 01:45:54.866]  We didn't get to play Ted's, uh...
[01:46:21.670 --> 01:46:23.172]  Ted's theme song.
[01:46:23.673 --> 01:46:26.877]  Just play a few seconds of it real fast for folks.
[01:46:27.298 --> 01:46:28.239]  Then I'm going to jam in.
[01:46:28.259 --> 01:46:30.863]  Oh my gosh, we've got loaded phones.
[01:46:30.883 --> 01:46:34.888]  I'm going to give each caller about 45 seconds as you take us out at the end of the year.
[01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:37.092]  Here is the gold theme song I forgot to play.
[01:46:49.508 --> 01:46:50.268]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:46:50.328 --> 01:46:50.849]  That's enough.
[01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:53.250]  I want to know where the gold at.
[01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:54.850]  Look at that crack head.
[01:46:55.731 --> 01:46:58.432]  What's going on with... Who's first up here?
[01:47:00.253 --> 01:47:01.233]  Justin in Illinois.
[01:47:01.273 --> 01:47:02.594]  You are on the air worldwide.
[01:47:03.634 --> 01:47:04.575]  Yes sir, Alex.
[01:47:04.655 --> 01:47:07.576]  Thank you for speaking truth to tyranny as always.
[01:47:08.937 --> 01:47:13.219]  God bless 2008 for being another year of the Ron Paul revolution.
[01:47:14.557 --> 01:47:17.318]  Hopefully 2009 we will continue our awakening.
[01:47:17.338 --> 01:47:25.442]  Hopefully we will use the enemy's operation to unmask them and we will use the opportunity that the public is awakening and listening to the truth now.
[01:47:25.662 --> 01:47:25.962]  Yes!
[01:47:26.743 --> 01:47:36.367]  Absolutely and we're going to continue to prove that Obama is just more of the same and that like according to the Washington Times article from last week
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:40.701]  Where he's keeping 150 Bush political appointees at the Pentagon.
[01:47:41.182 --> 01:47:42.362]  What more do people need, Alex?
[01:47:42.382 --> 01:47:47.784]  Well, take the new guy who's the head of the NAFTA and GATT operations who openly wants a North American Union.
[01:47:48.304 --> 01:47:52.146]  That's his new head of trade when Obama said he was going to get rid of NAFTA and GATT.
[01:47:52.466 --> 01:47:53.226]  Total betrayal.
[01:47:53.666 --> 01:47:55.047]  Oh, that's the trade representative.
[01:47:55.087 --> 01:47:55.447]  The U.S.
[01:47:55.507 --> 01:47:57.948]  trade representative who's unaccountable to the Congress.
[01:47:59.028 --> 01:48:01.029]  Well, Congress, I never got to it today.
[01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:12.137]  Congress, as an InfoWars story that was in the Associated Press, is bitching at NORTHCOM, saying, you've signed deals to use foreign troops, you've signed deals to put troops on our streets, you didn't consult us!
[01:48:13.658 --> 01:48:15.680]  I mean, this is happening, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:16.621]  That's right.
[01:48:17.922 --> 01:48:19.182]  Good to hear from you, God bless you.
[01:48:19.803 --> 01:48:22.345]  Rich, in North Carolina, you're on the air, Rich.
[01:48:22.385 --> 01:48:22.945]  Hit me hard.
[01:48:23.005 --> 01:48:23.465]  Let's go.
[01:48:23.586 --> 01:48:25.067]  Right on, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:48:25.347 --> 01:48:26.668]  I'm a Marine Corps vet, and
[01:48:27.389 --> 01:48:34.595]  I hold degrees in psychology and philosophy, and I'm not saying that to brag, I'm just saying that I've been on the inside of the machine on many levels.
[01:48:35.375 --> 01:48:42.461]  My so-called psych education, which by the way was at Western Carolina University, where they did a lot of the Human Genome Project, that education disturbed me.
[01:48:42.481 --> 01:48:48.265]  I'll give you an example, the Milgram experiments, and something else more important to me was the concept of learned helplessness.
[01:48:48.325 --> 01:48:56.772]  The experiments where they would place puppies into cubicles with electric torture plates and consecutively shot the poor animals to the point of utter submission.
[01:48:57.918 --> 01:49:01.422]  Now further, while I was in the Marine Corps, I spent some time in Guantanamo.
[01:49:01.442 --> 01:49:01.722]  Absolutely.
[01:49:21.129 --> 01:49:27.530]  Something like 90% of people, one of them was 70, to torture people to death if they were ordered to do so, right?
[01:49:28.051 --> 01:49:28.731]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:28.991 --> 01:49:33.392]  And then they've done it with rats and puppies on how to shock the public in the submission.
[01:49:33.892 --> 01:49:38.073]  Take us out, and then I'm going to finish up an overdrive with you, because it's a special show into the year.
[01:49:38.333 --> 01:49:39.393]  We'll do 20 minutes overdrive.
[01:49:39.413 --> 01:49:41.194]  But I'm going to keep you on the Genesis line.
[01:49:41.214 --> 01:49:43.674]  I'll go a few minutes over on it, and then we'll put up the number for everybody else.
[01:49:44.514 --> 01:49:46.795]  Rich and Chris and Ronnie and Rosalia.
[01:49:49.228 --> 01:49:52.209]  Tell folks about the torturing the puppy.
[01:49:53.670 --> 01:50:07.917]  What they would do is put a puppy inside of a cage and inside it they have this electric shock plate and they would call the puppy or pull it over with food or some other means to get it over and then they would shock and of course the animal is going to react and jump away.
[01:50:08.413 --> 01:50:12.479]  Well then, in the next stage, they would put a larger plate in.
[01:50:12.499 --> 01:50:16.604]  They would continue to increase the size of the plate until it was completely covered the bottom of the cage.
[01:50:16.965 --> 01:50:22.352]  So the dog actually had nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, and it would cower in the corner while being shocked.
[01:50:22.733 --> 01:50:23.694]  Just shivering.
[01:50:25.134 --> 01:50:28.636]  And they're testing with the television and the culture to train us to do that.
[01:50:30.237 --> 01:50:30.737]  Stay there.
[01:50:31.498 --> 01:50:32.538]  We're going to go into overdrive.
[01:50:32.558 --> 01:50:38.942]  The only place to hear it is InfoWars.com on those audio streams and to view it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:38.982 --> 01:50:41.163]  We're ending the main transmission for the year right now.
[01:50:41.483 --> 01:50:44.785]  God bless you all, all of our affiliates and listeners and sponsors.
[01:50:44.825 --> 01:50:45.326]  God bless you.
[01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:49.908]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:49.988 --> 01:50:51.229]  John, go ahead and keep...
[01:50:57.053 --> 01:50:59.214]  Rich in North Carolina on the line, okay?
[01:50:59.254 --> 01:50:59.754]  Is he still there?
[01:50:59.774 --> 01:51:02.614]  How long do I have until you've got to get me off here?
[01:51:10.596 --> 01:51:11.076]  Okay, fine.
[01:51:11.096 --> 01:51:15.197]  I'll let him finish up, and then I want to have just these callers, folks.
[01:51:15.657 --> 01:51:16.278]  Nobody else.
[01:51:16.318 --> 01:51:17.018]  I want to have Dave
[01:51:18.027 --> 01:51:23.033]  Justin, Chris, Ronnie, and a few others that are holding there, call the number I'm going to put on screen.
[01:51:23.093 --> 01:51:23.654]  It's 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, or 512-646-5400.
[01:51:23.714 --> 01:51:23.934]  Again, 888-201-2244.
[01:51:36.547 --> 01:51:39.929]  I wanted to say something about the time I spent in Guantanamo, if that's cool.
[01:52:03.925 --> 01:52:06.947]  Yeah, I mean, I would like to do that, but finish up with what happens with the puppy.
[01:52:08.408 --> 01:52:13.592]  Ultimately, the dog, as the phrase implies, learned helplessness.
[01:52:14.172 --> 01:52:18.455]  It's basically a means by which to completely, utterly, and control the animal.
[01:52:18.973 --> 01:52:22.896]  To where it will not react, it will not even come to get its own food.
[01:52:22.916 --> 01:52:27.338]  It would literally, the animals would starve rather than subject themselves.
[01:52:27.418 --> 01:52:29.180]  Yeah, it's called capitulation.
[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:36.584]  And they admit that the rat, dog, and monkey studies, and now they've done it with humans at Guantanamo, I think you're about to get to that.
[01:52:36.845 --> 01:52:40.687]  I'm guessing what they found, because it's a laboratory, they admit that.
[01:52:40.707 --> 01:52:42.248]  That's why they take innocent people there.
[01:52:43.849 --> 01:52:44.812]  And I want to hear this story.
[01:52:45.193 --> 01:52:51.830]  What they're doing is, for listeners that don't understand, when they taser you for no reason, when they arrest a girl for giving a friend a...
[01:52:52.734 --> 01:52:54.074]  Over-the-counter cough drop.
[01:52:55.115 --> 01:53:04.717]  They're training you that the government can do whatever corrupt, asinine, abusive things they want to set that precedent and to make you feel like you're helpless and can't resist.
[01:53:05.538 --> 01:53:08.639]  It's total psychological warfare to make you feel helpless.
[01:53:08.679 --> 01:53:09.659]  We are not helpless.
[01:53:09.859 --> 01:53:11.259]  We are going to beat the New World Order.
[01:53:11.499 --> 01:53:13.300]  Now, you've got the floor for the next three minutes, sir.
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:17.021]  Go ahead and tell folks about what you saw at Guantanamo Bay.
[01:53:17.694 --> 01:53:22.615]  Now, what I saw in Guantanamo, this isn't relating to the psychological aspect.
[01:53:23.535 --> 01:53:26.356]  I was in 1995 during Operation Sea Signal.
[01:53:27.456 --> 01:53:32.197]  I saw firsthand the way the Clinton administration and the military treated the Cuban folks.
[01:53:32.217 --> 01:53:33.157]  I'll give you a quick example.
[01:53:33.857 --> 01:53:45.759]  My unit was on a morning run, and because Operation Sea Signal was all branch of the service, there was an army unit, and they were passing cigarettes to eight, nine, ten-year-old children through the fence, the Cuban migrants.
[01:53:46.505 --> 01:54:03.660]  And I immediately broke ranks and did, as did most of my unit, and the branch rivalry stoked us and we kicked the snot out of these guys, whom we found out later were these so-called elite 82nd Airborne, and a bunch of marine computer programmers, a mechanic, and some radio techs whipped them pretty good.
[01:54:04.661 --> 01:54:08.825]  Another time, I have a more gruesome story, perhaps for another day if you're interested in that, but I wanted to
[01:54:09.161 --> 01:54:10.322]  Well, tell me the rest of the story.
[01:54:10.342 --> 01:54:11.223]  Go ahead.
[01:54:11.363 --> 01:54:13.105]  Okay, I was in a camp.
[01:54:14.026 --> 01:54:17.310]  I was guarding this particular camp and there was a family they brought in.
[01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:19.532]  It was a large group of folks they brought in one night.
[01:54:20.473 --> 01:54:22.635]  And I got to be good friends with a doctor fellow.
[01:54:22.675 --> 01:54:23.436]  He had really good English.
[01:54:23.476 --> 01:54:24.357]  My Spanish was terrible.
[01:54:24.898 --> 01:54:26.159]  And he told me what happened.
[01:54:26.659 --> 01:54:29.903]  A family member of his living in Miami sent them a boat.
[01:54:30.183 --> 01:54:31.905]  And all these folks got on board this boat.
[01:54:32.392 --> 01:54:33.813]  And they were hightailing to Miami.
[01:54:33.853 --> 01:54:36.294]  Well, they were just about out of Cuban waters.
[01:54:36.634 --> 01:54:39.215]  And bear in mind, this is just the story I got from the doctor.
[01:54:39.816 --> 01:54:43.578]  And the Cuban Coast Guard, without any warning, opened fire on them.
[01:54:44.078 --> 01:54:47.339]  And they called for a bullhorn, and we've got women, we've got children, please stop.
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:48.500]  Well, they didn't.
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:50.561]  And so they sped away, trying to evade them.
[01:54:50.761 --> 01:54:56.664]  And just as the American Coast Guard intercepted, there was a pregnant lady on board.
[01:54:56.744 --> 01:54:58.725]  And she fell, hit her head, broke her neck.
[01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:08.643]  Well, about that time, about three days later, Janet Reno came down to Guantanamo and made the declaration that pretty much all the Cubans were going to be sent back.
[01:55:09.523 --> 01:55:25.869]  Well, this doctor fellow told me, and he was terrified, and he told me what happened to several of his doctor friends who spoke out in the government and whatnot, but these folks were... Essentially, the entire group of them were charged with murder.
[01:55:29.210 --> 01:55:29.730]  Amazing.
[01:55:30.791 --> 01:55:31.491]  Mind-boggling.
[01:55:32.252 --> 01:55:39.536]  So they were charged with murder for her breaking her neck as if their attempt to escape to freedom was murder.
[01:55:40.337 --> 01:55:40.737]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:41.858 --> 01:55:42.578]  Well, that's tyranny.
[01:55:42.618 --> 01:55:43.499]  That's Cuba for you.
[01:55:43.519 --> 01:55:44.779]  That's what we're becoming here.
[01:55:44.839 --> 01:55:45.440]  It's so sad.
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:46.680]  Now, what was the other story?
[01:55:49.502 --> 01:55:51.563]  You were about to say something else and I said, no, tell that story.
[01:55:52.084 --> 01:55:53.244]  Oh, it wasn't much of a story.
[01:55:53.284 --> 01:55:57.687]  It was just more of a declaration reverting back to the learned helplessness in my own awakening.
[01:55:58.491 --> 01:56:04.814]  Uh, which, you know, coupled with a lot of problems I had, you know, major depression, and it kept me very reclusive and very apathetic for way too long.
[01:56:05.434 --> 01:56:10.716]  And I saw Zeitgeist about three months ago, and I was awakened, and I wanted to put out a message to the New World Order.
[01:56:11.396 --> 01:56:13.197]  Your indoctrination camp failed.
[01:56:13.557 --> 01:56:15.418]  You hijacked my beloved Marine Corps.
[01:56:15.805 --> 01:56:24.270]  And although I'm no longer enlisted, I swore an eternal oath to the Constitution and the Republic, and I dedicate my life to your complete destruction.
[01:56:24.570 --> 01:56:26.571]  And lastly, Alex, I appreciate you, brother.
[01:56:26.851 --> 01:56:28.572]  You're a 21st century Paul Revere.
[01:56:28.933 --> 01:56:34.696]  Have a great New Year, and hopefully you and I will see no more 9-11s and many more February 11ths.
[01:56:34.716 --> 01:56:35.557]  We share a birthday.
[01:56:35.617 --> 01:56:36.237]  Take care, brother.
[01:56:36.548 --> 01:56:36.808]  All right.
[01:56:36.848 --> 01:56:37.649]  God bless you, sir.
[01:56:38.069 --> 01:56:40.591]  Good to hear from Rich in North Carolina.
[01:56:40.671 --> 01:56:43.433]  That is it for this transmission with Genesis.
[01:56:43.553 --> 01:56:46.335]  I want to thank the Genesis Network and John Harmon.
[01:56:46.355 --> 01:56:49.157]  Pop in here for the last show of the year and say bye to everybody.
[01:56:51.618 --> 01:56:52.539]  Goodbye, everybody.
[01:56:52.559 --> 01:56:53.660]  It's been a great year.
[01:56:54.861 --> 01:56:56.362]  Why do you have reverb on your voice?
[01:56:56.382 --> 01:56:57.102]  What's going on there?
[01:56:57.182 --> 01:56:58.843]  Sorry about that.
[01:56:58.863 --> 01:56:59.764]  I was just, you know.
[01:57:00.745 --> 01:57:04.767]  But yeah, everybody have a happy new year and we'll see you tomorrow, which is 2009.
[01:57:06.129 --> 01:57:07.189]  Have a happy FEMA!
[01:57:08.010 --> 01:57:09.810]  Yes, have a happy FEMA.
[01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:16.092]  By the way, speaking of Beelzebub, when I'm done here in about 15 minutes, I need to call you, John, about tomorrow's show.
[01:57:17.012 --> 01:57:17.212]  Okay.
[01:57:17.732 --> 01:57:18.212]  I will be here.
[01:57:18.612 --> 01:57:19.312]  You will be there?
[01:57:19.672 --> 01:57:20.273]  Yep, 10 minutes.
[01:57:20.913 --> 01:57:21.133]  Yeah.
[01:57:21.453 --> 01:57:21.993]  Yeah, I'll be here.
[01:57:22.013 --> 01:57:22.193]  Alright.
[01:57:22.533 --> 01:57:23.313]  I appreciate you, buddy.
[01:57:23.353 --> 01:57:23.734]  Take care.
[01:57:23.854 --> 01:57:24.194]  Anytime.
[01:57:24.414 --> 01:57:24.614]  Bye-bye.
[01:57:24.674 --> 01:57:26.114]  Alright, there goes Genesis.
[01:57:27.795 --> 01:57:32.656]  I said I'd go to Chris in Florida, Jeff, and
[01:57:34.642 --> 01:57:35.962]  Rosalyn, is that Rosalyn?
[01:57:36.002 --> 01:57:37.143]  I'm sorry, I wasn't reading that right.
[01:57:37.163 --> 01:57:39.803]  This screen is so small, I think my eyes aren't as good as they were.
[01:57:41.424 --> 01:57:41.824]  Russell?
[01:57:42.144 --> 01:57:45.345]  I mean, I want Rosalyn and Ronnie, who are holding the bell, to get in.
[01:57:45.665 --> 01:57:46.645]  Is the phone system still open?
[01:57:47.826 --> 01:57:48.506]  Well, call in.
[01:57:48.526 --> 01:57:50.766]  888-201-2244.
[01:57:51.187 --> 01:57:53.327]  We are internet only right now.
[01:57:53.347 --> 01:57:55.488]  The internet stream is at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:56.673 --> 01:57:59.954]  And the video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:59.974 --> 01:58:03.215]  And we want the PrisonPlanet.tv members to use the live feature.
[01:58:03.235 --> 01:58:08.056]  I know most of you watch it after we archive it each day, a few hours after it's posted on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:08.076 --> 01:58:11.838]  But you can go to the top of PrisonPlanet.tv and it says log in for the live show.
[01:58:12.438 --> 01:58:14.818]  And we're just going to start always going live the last two hours.
[01:58:15.639 --> 01:58:20.020]  I may move the show where maybe the middle two hours are live or something.
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:20.780]  I don't know.
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:21.740]  We're thinking about that.
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:22.941]  The New Year it's going to be set
[01:58:23.797 --> 01:58:29.581]  And we've got a lot of other stuff coming up with this TV show where we're going to put it on TV and cable or additional work.
[01:58:29.761 --> 01:58:30.861]  We're working on all that right now.
[01:58:30.901 --> 01:58:34.784]  We're building another TV studio out there for one hour a week, produced new show.
[01:58:35.344 --> 01:58:36.605]  There's a lot of stuff going on.
[01:58:36.625 --> 01:58:40.067]  I want to thank all of you for your support that's made all of that possible.
[01:58:40.628 --> 01:58:42.869]  Again, we're the 2008 is about to be over.
[01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:48.312]  And I've wrote all these notes of issues and topics and points I wanted to make.
[01:58:48.913 --> 01:58:52.055]  So we'll take a few calls and I'll hit a few of those and we'll end this transmission.
[01:58:52.891 --> 01:58:54.553]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Florida.
[01:58:54.593 --> 01:58:57.595]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:58:57.635 --> 01:58:58.155]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:58.856 --> 01:58:59.777]  Hi, thanks for calling back.
[01:59:00.597 --> 01:59:00.977]  Hey, man.
[01:59:01.338 --> 01:59:03.920]  Hey, I think we did a lot of good in 2008.
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:12.927]  A lot of people showed up to protest Voderberg, and more people, like you said, than ever protesting the Federal Reserve know that it's private.
[01:59:13.547 --> 01:59:19.612]  But what I wanted to call you about was something that I had come across while job hunting, and I was wondering if you knew about it.
[01:59:23.118 --> 01:59:36.261]  Yeah, they give you these big psychology 600 question tests to see if you're deceptive or evasive or to get your personality type.
[01:59:36.721 --> 01:59:42.723]  And as freaked out as people are about those, and insurance companies give companies breaks to do it so they're standardizing it,
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:51.706]  The real thing is Google or your digital cable, it's tracking what you watch and do, and that's much more detailed psychological algorithmic profile.
[01:59:52.006 --> 01:59:57.491]  But no, I mean, tell me specifically what was happening with the psychological profile test.
[01:59:58.351 --> 02:00:00.693]  Well, it was a particular job interview.
[02:00:00.713 --> 02:00:08.319]  I had spoken one-on-one with one of these management people, and you know, he liked me, we got along great and everything.
[02:00:09.051 --> 02:00:16.297]  I went and I took the test, and afterwards, I wasn't supposed to, I guess, enter it, you know, when I finished.
[02:00:16.858 --> 02:00:24.385]  And when I did, it broke it down to some subcategories, and it said, you know, follows orders excessively.
[02:00:25.005 --> 02:00:28.268]  It said sociability, and then it said fair.
[02:00:28.648 --> 02:00:31.831]  It said, you know, like, listing the good, fair, poor, such and such.
[02:00:32.272 --> 02:00:36.015]  And then at the bottom, it said overall fit for a job, and then it said good.
[02:00:36.806 --> 02:00:38.187]  So when he came over, he reviewed it.
[02:00:38.247 --> 02:00:41.730]  He said, we weren't supposed to, you know, finish the test and see the answers.
[02:00:42.371 --> 02:00:44.032]  And I said, well, it says overall fit good.
[02:00:44.713 --> 02:00:47.935]  And he said, well, I've never seen an excessive before.
[02:00:48.536 --> 02:00:50.777]  I have to go and, you know, review this with my boss.
[02:00:51.558 --> 02:00:53.840]  So, you know, here we had gotten along real well and everything.
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:57.183]  I thought I was going to get the job and that pretty much blew it for me.
[02:00:57.563 --> 02:01:01.026]  But if I was following orders excessively, I wouldn't have pressed enter after he said not to.
[02:01:04.983 --> 02:01:10.924]  Those tests aren't complex enough to accurately peg somebody.
[02:01:11.184 --> 02:01:12.645]  Humans are too multifaceted.
[02:01:12.665 --> 02:01:15.626]  It's just more crap.
[02:01:16.026 --> 02:01:17.166]  Everybody plays God.
[02:01:17.246 --> 02:01:19.627]  Psychologists, psychiatrists know it all.
[02:01:19.667 --> 02:01:23.068]  These little petty managers feel like they're in elite guilds.
[02:01:24.108 --> 02:01:26.569]  It's all a bunch of quackery and that's why our country's falling apart.
[02:01:27.901 --> 02:01:29.402]  I just wanted to get your thoughts on it, Alex.
[02:01:29.983 --> 02:01:30.783]  I appreciate you.
[02:01:31.323 --> 02:01:32.204]  Now you too, my friend.
[02:01:32.824 --> 02:01:33.945]  This is like the Oracles.
[02:01:35.306 --> 02:01:43.111]  For 30, 40 years, hundreds of thousands of people went to prison, probably millions, but I know hundreds of thousands went to prison off lie detectors.
[02:01:43.571 --> 02:01:45.192]  And it turned out a lot of them were completely innocent.
[02:01:45.492 --> 02:01:46.312]  They'd say, I'm not lying.
[02:01:48.314 --> 02:01:49.674]  It was an excuse for the FBI
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:55.021]  Examiner, and it turned out the FBI Crime Lab framed tens of thousands.
[02:01:55.061 --> 02:01:55.581]  That's admitted.
[02:01:55.721 --> 02:01:57.742]  Frederick Whitehurst went public about that, Dr. Frederick Whitehurst.
[02:01:58.862 --> 02:02:01.102]  And all these other state crime labs and city crime labs.
[02:02:01.382 --> 02:02:04.123]  Came out a few years ago, the Houston Crime Lab framed anybody and everybody.
[02:02:04.143 --> 02:02:06.404]  You know, they would just say anything was cocaine.
[02:02:06.444 --> 02:02:07.944]  They'd say, proof you murdered somebody.
[02:02:09.384 --> 02:02:13.305]  But what they do is, they just say, oh, the lie detector says you're a liar.
[02:02:14.406 --> 02:02:17.506]  Well, it got proven that that was a fraud.
[02:02:18.027 --> 02:02:19.427]  Now, the reason I say this is like an oracle,
[02:02:20.868 --> 02:02:26.322]  is that in Greece they would have a drugged out uh... vestal virgin
[02:02:27.646 --> 02:02:34.392]  on hallucinogenic drugs and she would mumble and babble a bunch of bull to the royalty and people would come pay to hear what I had to say.
[02:02:34.613 --> 02:02:38.997]  And then a priest would say, and she'd be like, Ach-bloogie-mah-zula-pah-konda!
[02:02:39.377 --> 02:02:40.098]  Or, you know, whatever.
[02:02:40.198 --> 02:02:40.919]  Oh, booga-booga!
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:46.464]  Or Arcadian Isis, you know, or who knows what babble.
[02:02:47.505 --> 02:02:52.209]  And then the priest would say, they say give more money to the priest to it.
[02:02:52.249 --> 02:02:52.809]  I mean, literally.
[02:02:53.470 --> 02:03:00.519]  And that's why, you know, they have it in like 300, kind of a stylized deal, you know, where the enemy comes and pays off the oracles to tell them they're going to lose.
[02:03:02.561 --> 02:03:05.225]  I mean, it's the same thing over and over again.
[02:03:05.265 --> 02:03:08.349]  So, the oracle, the lie detector says you're guilty.
[02:03:08.789 --> 02:03:09.830]  Turns out it's total bull.
[02:03:11.775 --> 02:03:19.498]  It could be used when somebody was lying to say, oh, this shows you're being evasive, to trick people thinking it was magic into admitting they were lying.
[02:03:20.558 --> 02:03:22.099]  But again, the operator can lie.
[02:03:22.379 --> 02:03:25.120]  The machine is not anywhere close to 100%.
[02:03:28.581 --> 02:03:29.102]  It's bull.
[02:03:29.162 --> 02:03:30.062]  It's called quackery.
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:31.560]  Okay.
[02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:35.403]  It'd be like if I claimed this pen could find water and sold it for a million bucks.
[02:03:35.463 --> 02:03:40.647]  This magical pen, blessed by bubble shnobble, says that it can find water.
[02:03:40.947 --> 02:03:42.228]  I'm sure I can find an idiot to buy it.
[02:03:46.434 --> 02:03:47.975]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[02:03:48.816 --> 02:03:51.499]  Now they have passive brain scanners in the airports.
[02:03:51.539 --> 02:04:05.471]  Why, the brain scanner showed an area of your brain was upset, or, oh, now they'll show you an image of a dead body, or an image of the crime scene, and if your brain registers that it's seen it before, that means that you did the murder.
[02:04:06.516 --> 02:04:20.201]  But we've seen millions of simulated murders and most people have seen something similar because of television to that, so there's already studies showing that these computer programs that they're convicting people with, it's bull!
[02:04:21.742 --> 02:04:34.247]  I mean they show you a picture of a fourteen-year-old naked girl and it's similar enough to a twenty-year-old naked woman that your brain clicks recognize and they go, oh that's it, he's a pedophile, prison.
[02:04:35.725 --> 02:04:36.726]  There's cases of that now.
[02:04:36.746 --> 02:04:41.308]  Or, you know, they show you a woman, you know, handcuffed with her guts cut out.
[02:04:41.728 --> 02:04:42.368]  Murder photo.
[02:04:42.809 --> 02:04:42.909]  Oh!
[02:04:43.829 --> 02:04:45.410]  Your brain says you recognize that.
[02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:47.851]  Well, of course it recognizes it!
[02:04:48.191 --> 02:04:50.332]  It's seen that a million times on television.
[02:04:50.893 --> 02:04:51.713]  Similar things.
[02:04:51.753 --> 02:04:53.934]  The brain, you know, has categories.
[02:04:53.954 --> 02:04:54.595]  This is a computer.
[02:04:54.675 --> 02:04:55.295]  Electrochemical.
[02:04:56.505 --> 02:05:00.347]  And they've got new lie detectors they hook you up to, and they've got all these tests on this bull.
[02:05:01.247 --> 02:05:09.951]  And it is true that these multi-phase tests can find a low-grade moron liar, or someone who thinks they're smart and deceptive.
[02:05:09.971 --> 02:05:10.751]  There's lots of those.
[02:05:11.511 --> 02:05:15.933]  But generally, it's not reliable.
[02:05:16.653 --> 02:05:18.454]  I mean, it's not anywhere near 100%.
[02:05:18.494 --> 02:05:23.056]  A lot of people will be lazy, and just kind of, well, now you've found out they're lazy.
[02:05:24.821 --> 02:05:26.402]  So there's all sorts of stuff going on.
[02:05:26.482 --> 02:05:29.703]  Also, the elite is having to do all this because they've destroyed society by design.
[02:05:30.023 --> 02:05:31.503]  The public's completely fallen apart.
[02:05:31.924 --> 02:05:41.247]  My dad was sent, he's a medical company, mid-level, mid-high, you know, what do you say between mid and high?
[02:05:41.287 --> 02:05:46.949]  You know, kind of a lower-level, high-level executive for a pretty good-sized medical company.
[02:05:48.118 --> 02:05:48.258]  And
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:30.625]  Surf slaves that would basically follow easy orders, and that the German kindergarten brainwashing model worked too well, so everybody's annihilated now, so they're either immoral or stupid or both, and so now what corporations want to find is actually anti-New World Order people who are still intelligent and moral, but then your problem is that if you're doing something immoral, you can't really control them, and all this stuff.
[02:06:31.245 --> 02:06:32.405]  I mean, that's what it is!
[02:06:32.465 --> 02:06:34.426]  They have just annihilated the public,
[02:06:35.359 --> 02:06:51.055]  to where they're just about it because they've done this down just to be steel level where they just program primitive responses and they just punch those buttons to make us more easily controllable they've done this down there are psychological uh... vision our overall psyches uh...
[02:06:52.568 --> 02:06:53.589]  Plain of view.
[02:06:54.010 --> 02:06:55.632]  You know, the overall universe.
[02:06:56.794 --> 02:06:58.135]  And it's just devastating.
[02:06:58.175 --> 02:06:59.718]  It's a great crime against humanity.
[02:06:59.998 --> 02:07:01.280]  And they're just now getting started.
[02:07:02.161 --> 02:07:10.111]  So they have to ask all these questionnaires and have drug tests and spy on their employees because the public itself is just filled with scum and trash and criminals.
[02:07:11.255 --> 02:07:11.916]  And delusion.
[02:07:11.936 --> 02:07:13.577]  The public is under mass delusion.
[02:07:13.597 --> 02:07:22.204]  Instead of wanting to know the truth, instead of really wanting to know what's really going on with yourself, your neighbors, your life, instead of wanting to get real, find out the fundamentals of humanity, being alive on this planet...
[02:07:23.308 --> 02:07:30.471]  People have gotten into lying to themselves, being deceitful, being delusional, imagining they're something they're not, whether it's good or bad.
[02:07:30.731 --> 02:07:41.456]  You know, Madison Avenue is there to make good people, who are really high quality and wondrous souls, just literally radiating with potential and power and beauty and creativity.
[02:07:41.476 --> 02:07:47.179]  The universe, they make you feel inadequate because your hips are a little plump, which is actually what men want.
[02:07:47.719 --> 02:07:51.241]  You don't look like a ten-year-old boy, you know, when you're a thirty-year-old woman.
[02:07:52.161 --> 02:07:59.543]  Because that's the men that run the fashion thing, like 10-year-old boys, they don't like 30-year-old women.
[02:08:00.283 --> 02:08:08.865]  And so that's why men in all these studies don't like the supermodel look, they like the, you know, what do they call it, MILFs.
[02:08:09.245 --> 02:08:10.865]  I'm getting a lot of control here.
[02:08:11.105 --> 02:08:15.246]  The point is, is that this is the mass programming.
[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:20.703]  And there's thousands of different points along those lines.
[02:08:21.584 --> 02:08:32.152]  And they've just wrecked society to make it more easily controllable, but they haven't gotten to their robotic society yet, where the mechanized robots and drones and militaries are in place yet.
[02:08:32.492 --> 02:08:36.556]  And so they're having trouble finishing their New World Order because they've wrecked people so bad.
[02:08:37.628 --> 02:08:39.690]  And so they make good people feel inadequate.
[02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:46.775]  They give men a false image of what a warrior is, not helping your society, your culture, your children, not being informed.
[02:08:47.195 --> 02:08:50.678]  It's loving football and acting tough and having tattoos.
[02:08:52.731 --> 02:08:53.472]  And riding a Harley.
[02:08:53.492 --> 02:08:55.033]  And I'm not saying you're bad enough to ride a Harley.
[02:08:55.053 --> 02:08:55.533]  You know what I mean.
[02:08:55.573 --> 02:08:56.594]  That's their whole image.
[02:08:56.614 --> 02:08:58.155]  Get out of my way!
[02:08:58.215 --> 02:08:59.757]  Call me!
[02:08:59.797 --> 02:09:01.458]  You know, just kind of real stupid.
[02:09:01.658 --> 02:09:21.634]  But on the other side, it's about making people feel inadequate and also then making the petty yuppies and other subclasses feel real secure and good in their own little niches, which are pre-programmed little social engineer niches that are controlled and serviced by substrata propaganda conduits from the overall master matrix integration center.
[02:09:22.825 --> 02:09:42.380]  Okay, so the big mainframe comes up with the different countercultures through the systems and they deliver that down, knowing people want to be individualistic and rebel, they give them false individualistic rebel constructs to enter into in the overall scheme and then they play the different subgroups off against each other in that nexus port.
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:46.543]  And they've got the police in their subculture, they've got all the other subcultures.
[02:09:49.036 --> 02:09:55.581]  And so that's why I found even bashing the police, which I still primitively do, actually plays into the overall vortices
[02:09:56.917 --> 02:10:05.499]  As they play the public off against the police when we're really all in the same substrata together with the enemy in placements engaging in the social engineering attacks against us all.
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:24.905]  Only by breaking through those membrane separation points and seeing our commonality and our common goal and our common future to work together in defense of humanity and honor and liberty can we overall invade the matrix level system before it gets to its next phase when it'll be really hard to get rid of, when the armies are robotic, when
[02:10:25.805 --> 02:10:44.461]  When the attack craft are all pre-programmed and drone where one globalist can launch an entire worldwide military attack even if the military says no it won't matter because a pre-programmed war game system has been put into function and that attack profile they'll have hundreds of attack profiles put in for their robotic
[02:10:45.598 --> 02:10:58.627]  Drone forces with entire factories and robotic armored reservations separate from human activity other than highly compartmentalized technicians that go in and service the overall system.
[02:10:58.947 --> 02:11:10.134]  And then those compartmentalized even in NORAD and other areas won't see it because the overall attack plans, which they'll have hundreds of, will be pre-programmed in the name of simulations.
[02:11:10.355 --> 02:11:15.298]  They will then just go green light with the real simulation and attack whoever they want.
[02:11:16.298 --> 02:11:29.201]  And I see the main attack not being a biological one, though the elite of Shell with their genetic engineering may be reckless and do that, because they know that can get out of hand and they might not have proper cures or it could mutate.
[02:11:29.441 --> 02:11:42.344]  The cleaner way to go, and the way I believe they're going to attack by the year 2020 as their go date, is a drone robot fleet attack with aircraft dropping neutron bombs on every major city and town.
[02:11:42.945 --> 02:11:47.243]  And I believe that is the main attack profile, but again that's my...
[02:11:49.188 --> 02:11:55.452]  own mass integration war games, studying enemy operations and past operations.
[02:11:56.132 --> 02:12:06.698]  The same projection I was able to give pre-911, because I saw their preparation, I knew their attack profile, I integrated thousands of pieces of data into that prime projection.
[02:12:06.998 --> 02:12:14.383]  I will tell you that the neutron bomb attack on every major city, and they may not even drop them, they may have robotic delivery trucks
[02:12:15.843 --> 02:12:17.244]  You know, deliver them into every city.
[02:12:18.044 --> 02:12:19.465]  I mean, they've got this at every level.
[02:12:19.485 --> 02:12:22.467]  I'm saying the neutron attack is what we are facing.
[02:12:22.747 --> 02:12:29.250]  I'll guarantee you that's a battle plan being prepared, and it's one of the major attack profiles that we are facing as a species.
[02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:36.433]  Now, you can laugh at me all you want, or you can decide to check out the information and fight against the enemy.
[02:12:38.074 --> 02:12:39.755]  Control freak bastards from hell.
[02:12:40.155 --> 02:12:43.957]  Now, let's just take three final calls, Jeff, Russell, and Carol.
[02:12:44.997 --> 02:12:45.777]  My wife's going to kill me.
[02:12:45.797 --> 02:12:47.237]  I'm supposed to be home to help her with something.
[02:12:47.297 --> 02:12:48.438]  Jeff in Oregon, go ahead.
[02:12:48.458 --> 02:12:50.578]  I've got three words for you.
[02:12:50.678 --> 02:12:51.858]  Project Bloopy.
[02:12:52.718 --> 02:12:53.939]  Yeah, fake alien attack.
[02:12:54.779 --> 02:12:56.279]  Yeah, the fake rapture.
[02:12:56.419 --> 02:12:58.659]  They can program it into anywhere in the world.
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:02.800]  Whatever predominant religious belief, that's what you will see in the sky.
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:10.662]  Well, they can also, with these cross poisons they put in us, then apply another poison and only certain people will drop dead.
[02:13:11.002 --> 02:13:12.262]  And so they've been prepared for that as well.
[02:13:12.984 --> 02:13:14.625]  Yeah, I was reading something about the chemtrails.
[02:13:14.645 --> 02:13:20.670]  That would actually act like a movie screen for their satellite imaging, their 3D holographic imaging.
[02:13:20.690 --> 02:13:22.051]  They've been testing that, yeah.
[02:13:22.231 --> 02:13:24.372]  Oh yeah, it's freaking ridiculous, man.
[02:13:24.853 --> 02:13:25.393]  Blame God!
[02:13:25.433 --> 02:13:26.093]  Happy New Year!
[02:13:26.834 --> 02:13:27.474]  Anything else, sir?
[02:13:28.015 --> 02:13:30.076]  I wanted to give a shout-out to Alex Anthory.
[02:13:30.236 --> 02:13:32.378]  I'm here in Portland, and he's the one who woke me up.
[02:13:32.978 --> 02:13:36.381]  Good going, Alex, on Oracle Broadcasting, outside the box.
[02:13:36.889 --> 02:13:37.029]  Yeah.
[02:13:37.409 --> 02:13:38.470]  I just want to say this, though.
[02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:39.910]  He's a really nice guy.
[02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:41.391]  And because people like him, I'm nice.
[02:13:41.811 --> 02:13:48.953]  I don't appreciate the... If I was in this for myself, I would sue people like that.
[02:13:49.673 --> 02:13:54.215]  Just because those delusional people make lies up about me, doesn't then make it true.
[02:13:54.935 --> 02:13:56.796]  And I mean, just endless lies.
[02:13:57.076 --> 02:13:58.596]  Endless how I'm the bad guy.
[02:13:58.916 --> 02:14:00.397]  Yeah, I mean, I've done nothing.
[02:14:01.934 --> 02:14:04.576]  I had some of those people accuse me of taking them off the air one day.
[02:14:04.596 --> 02:14:06.298]  I mean, it's insane lies.
[02:14:06.698 --> 02:14:08.079]  And I just, I don't deserve it.
[02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:14.624]  And then I get a sponsor calling up going, you know, what is this about them saying this and I didn't say something?
[02:14:14.925 --> 02:14:16.366]  It's all crap, man.
[02:14:17.187 --> 02:14:18.347]  All made up lies.
[02:14:18.548 --> 02:14:22.231]  And somebody called in earlier about another talk show host on another internet radio network.
[02:14:22.751 --> 02:14:24.853]  You know, about I'm going to debate them or something.
[02:14:24.893 --> 02:14:25.714]  And I didn't say that.
[02:14:26.094 --> 02:14:28.977]  Somebody called up all paranoid saying, this person says you're attacking them.
[02:14:28.997 --> 02:14:32.420]  And I said, no, I didn't attack them, but I ought to have him on as a guest sometime.
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:34.502]  And then it turns into, there's going to be a big debate.
[02:14:34.582 --> 02:14:35.763]  Are you afraid of the debate?
[02:14:35.843 --> 02:14:37.825]  I'm like, no, I said I didn't say anything about you.
[02:14:37.865 --> 02:14:39.227]  And we want to be friends.
[02:14:39.807 --> 02:14:41.909]  No, you don't want to be, so just get the hell out of my way!
[02:14:42.209 --> 02:14:46.753]  Go enjoy your cancer viruses and just drink all your Diet Coke and do whatever the hell you want, man!
[02:14:46.933 --> 02:14:50.196]  But don't, none of you will ever take away from the fact that I'm legitimate.
[02:14:50.457 --> 02:14:55.241]  None of you will ever take away the fact that I do love you, and that I do love humanity, and I really am for real.
[02:14:55.441 --> 02:14:58.003]  People can't deal with the fact that I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[02:14:58.343 --> 02:15:00.685]  They can't deal with the fact that I'm in some Hollywood movies.
[02:15:00.905 --> 02:15:06.889]  They can't deal with the fact that I know Willie Nelson and Charlie Sheen and Keanu Reeves and all these people.
[02:15:07.129 --> 02:15:09.811]  They can't deal with the fact that I've reached hundreds of millions of people.
[02:15:10.051 --> 02:15:12.293]  They can't deal with the fact that I've made all these films.
[02:15:12.533 --> 02:15:18.177]  They can't deal with the fact that every once in a while I tell a story about being jumped by a bunch of people and kicking their ass.
[02:15:18.197 --> 02:15:19.638]  They go, oh you're a liar, you're a wimp.
[02:15:19.958 --> 02:15:23.361]  As if at a primitive level, that I can't even have at the primitive level
[02:15:23.581 --> 02:15:26.283]  That I'm a man and I fight back.
[02:15:26.903 --> 02:15:28.064]  I've done everything real.
[02:15:28.184 --> 02:15:28.905]  I'm legitimate.
[02:15:28.945 --> 02:15:30.005]  It's the real deal.
[02:15:30.405 --> 02:15:37.810]  And all the exploits, all the things we've done is a testament to humanity and the power of humanity taking action.
[02:15:38.211 --> 02:15:44.275]  And that's why the COINTELPRO and the operatives and the disinformation people and all of them savagely attack me 24-7 everywhere.
[02:15:46.676 --> 02:15:49.039]  Because they can't stand it.
[02:15:49.279 --> 02:15:57.610]  The government has to pull down the image of Alex Jones because it's an image that others could emulate and then make even better and they could be leaders and dynamic.
[02:15:58.823 --> 02:16:12.671]  And it's so sad because I've always wanted to work with people and be nice to people, but I've learned 90% of the time when I've tried to reach out to other people to build them up, they stab me in the back because they're not in this to fight the New World Order.
[02:16:12.691 --> 02:16:15.532]  They don't understand just how real it is and how it's affecting them.
[02:16:15.552 --> 02:16:19.735]  Where if they do, it hasn't sunk into their subconscious.
[02:16:19.755 --> 02:16:27.279]  They consciously know it, but they don't subconsciously integrate it and realize we're all in this together in a red-level crisis of humanity together.
[02:16:30.037 --> 02:16:35.940]  And so I'm the big shot, I'm the big name, I'm the big guy in the Liberty Awakening movement worldwide.
[02:16:37.541 --> 02:16:38.962]  And they can't stand it.
[02:16:39.202 --> 02:16:42.804]  It is so upsetting to all these people.
[02:16:42.864 --> 02:16:58.233]  So they make up lies, they twist things, they take 5% truth, 95% lies, they take rumors, they mix them with things that are true, they, you know, just, just, just, just do things you can't even imagine
[02:16:59.113 --> 02:17:01.195]  And most of it isn't because they're even government operatives.
[02:17:01.215 --> 02:17:03.336]  Government operatives always get the ball started rolling.
[02:17:03.676 --> 02:17:10.641]  But it snowballs because they've been programmed by the society to be backstabbing, hateful, petty, delusional people.
[02:17:11.402 --> 02:17:15.585]  Instead of really working, instead of really fighting, instead of being on a mission to reach people.
[02:17:16.165 --> 02:17:17.707]  And then that brings in the success.
[02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:31.562]  They think if they just all attack, and they all do it to each other, they all attack each other, they're always infighting with each other, they're always bringing up grand master plans and ideas, and then never implementing it, and it's sad.
[02:17:33.536 --> 02:17:39.583]  But at the end of the day, I do what I do for my children and my family and people around me that I trust and I love.
[02:17:39.863 --> 02:17:45.749]  And I do it knowing that humanity will mature and that we're going to a better place and that we don't have a choice.
[02:17:45.789 --> 02:17:46.630]  We're fighting great evil.
[02:17:47.011 --> 02:17:49.694]  But at this end of the year show, it is very frustrating to me.
[02:17:51.388 --> 02:17:54.873]  That I turn the cheek over and over again.
[02:17:54.893 --> 02:17:59.860]  You know, on my MySpace, I see people come on and promote their operations, and I even tend to leave it there.
[02:18:00.461 --> 02:18:06.629]  I'll see them post and say, oh, thank you, and say hi, and then I even happen to know that very person's talking crap about me, and it's very painful.
[02:18:07.611 --> 02:18:09.653]  And I try to be Christ-like.
[02:18:10.074 --> 02:18:11.636]  I'm just a million miles away from that.
[02:18:11.676 --> 02:18:12.998]  But I try in my own feeble way.
[02:18:13.018 --> 02:18:14.459]  I go, I'm just going to leave that.
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:19.706]  I'm going to let them go ahead and promote themselves even though they've persecuted me and borne false witness hundreds of times.
[02:18:19.766 --> 02:18:22.189]  I'm going to go ahead.
[02:18:22.269 --> 02:18:25.414]  But at the same time, some of these groups are so dangerous.
[02:18:26.778 --> 02:18:31.241]  Some of these groups are so dangerous, I mean, trying to send me to prison, folks.
[02:18:31.321 --> 02:18:32.642]  I mean, stuff you can't imagine.
[02:18:32.662 --> 02:18:33.603]  We don't talk about it on air.
[02:18:33.983 --> 02:18:49.273]  Some of the locals that I have to fully block them and fully, so it's kind of a catch-22, but I don't want to turn into somebody who just goes out and crushes people, you know, anytime they do anything to me.
[02:18:50.367 --> 02:19:00.090]  I tend to just kind of shields up, break all contact, say nothing, give no response, and hope that they fend off like sharks onto somebody else.
[02:19:01.851 --> 02:19:02.731]  But I don't even do that.
[02:19:03.031 --> 02:19:04.412]  Overall, it's the moral thing to do.
[02:19:04.432 --> 02:19:13.435]  But the moral thing ends up helping you because then you don't waste your time spinning your wheels, infighting and running around dealing with people.
[02:19:13.775 --> 02:19:17.816]  You spend your time actually reaching out to others that do care.
[02:19:17.836 --> 02:19:18.617]  And so that's what I'd say.
[02:19:19.537 --> 02:19:25.741]  People trying to argue with you that go on YouTube and Google and say there's no new world order, you're crazy, you're a racist.
[02:19:25.861 --> 02:19:26.901]  Just ignore them, folks.
[02:19:29.383 --> 02:19:35.507]  They're operatives or they're of the same spirit, you know, being directed by the same system, the same programming.
[02:19:35.807 --> 02:19:36.427]  Just ignore them.
[02:19:36.507 --> 02:19:37.748]  Reach out to those that care.
[02:19:42.010 --> 02:19:47.754]  You know, reach out to people that do want to change things.
[02:19:50.256 --> 02:19:54.198]  And also, you know, you don't even so much need to work with others at first.
[02:19:54.278 --> 02:19:55.538]  You will find others you can work with later.
[02:19:55.919 --> 02:19:58.480]  I mean, you know, people say, well, what kind of access TV show do I need to do?
[02:19:58.580 --> 02:19:59.980]  Well, what kind of website do I need to start?
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.321]  What kind of community group?
[02:20:01.781 --> 02:20:02.261]  I don't know.
[02:20:02.281 --> 02:20:03.562]  I don't have all the answers.
[02:20:03.582 --> 02:20:04.522]  Go in different directions.
[02:20:05.323 --> 02:20:06.263]  Do different things.
[02:20:06.403 --> 02:20:07.404]  You will reach others.
[02:20:07.484 --> 02:20:08.564]  You will affect change.
[02:20:09.024 --> 02:20:12.346]  You will change the world around you.
[02:20:15.851 --> 02:20:20.313]  You know, here locally in Austin, I never went to a lot of events because I'm busy doing media.
[02:20:20.373 --> 02:20:24.854]  I mean, I can go speak to a crowd of two hundred people or a thousand people or whatever, or I can talk to millions.
[02:20:24.914 --> 02:20:26.295]  I can go do other radio interviews.
[02:20:26.435 --> 02:20:28.816]  I can write articles.
[02:20:29.216 --> 02:20:30.336]  That's what's more effective.
[02:20:33.318 --> 02:20:42.001]  But, I mean, you go to a patriot meeting, especially those that think they're mainline, those that are trying to make themselves the leadership, they'll just sit around talking crap about everybody.
[02:20:43.365 --> 02:20:50.352]  And I hate being even sucked into that because, you know, it's like these communities of shared hate.
[02:20:50.653 --> 02:20:53.075]  And so it's now like a religion to hate me.
[02:20:54.096 --> 02:20:57.960]  I mean, the vast majority of people love the show, the information, put up with my obnoxiousness.
[02:20:58.801 --> 02:21:01.344]  They've seen my predictions, my kernels of knowledge, my info.
[02:21:02.645 --> 02:21:05.308]  They know it's valuable, they have discernment, they know it's for real.
[02:21:07.048 --> 02:21:15.736]  But it is kind of weird, and I know that's a mark of success, to have an entire sub-religion that's just about hating me, and where everything
[02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:23.603]  You know, it's like a dynamism around the fable, the lie, but I realize that's those people hating themselves.
[02:21:23.663 --> 02:21:24.584]  It's a self-hate.
[02:21:25.104 --> 02:21:35.529]  They don't want there to be a successful, good, pure image, trying to be pure, of someone actually affecting things, having change in the world, reaching out to people.
[02:21:36.069 --> 02:21:37.050]  They don't want that.
[02:21:37.450 --> 02:21:42.312]  I'm going to go to your calls, three final calls, Jeff, Russell, and Carol, but I've got to say this.
[02:21:42.332 --> 02:21:43.513]  I meant to say this earlier in the show.
[02:21:44.333 --> 02:21:44.994]  A caller called.
[02:21:46.013 --> 02:21:49.835]  And said, America, freedom to fascism is airing on the official PBS channel in Denver.
[02:21:49.855 --> 02:21:51.816]  And I said, that is super news.
[02:21:52.696 --> 02:21:54.477]  And I said, give out their call letters.
[02:21:54.517 --> 02:21:55.478]  People can find out what it's on.
[02:21:55.538 --> 02:21:56.298]  That's three times.
[02:21:56.358 --> 02:21:57.218]  Give that out again.
[02:21:57.259 --> 02:21:57.759]  Give that out again.
[02:21:58.159 --> 02:22:00.040]  I mean, I was buoyed by that.
[02:22:01.661 --> 02:22:01.961]  And I...
[02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:10.154]  But I know that 80% of people in the quote Patriot movement are still, they're awake to the new world order, but they're diseased still by the world.
[02:22:10.214 --> 02:22:13.416]  The flesh itself, they'd go, oh, that movie's not that good, that guy's a Jew.
[02:22:13.436 --> 02:22:17.439]  I mean, 80% wouldn't say that, but of the 80% different percentages would say different things.
[02:22:17.479 --> 02:22:18.860]  Right, the movie's not that good.
[02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:21.702]  Well, now he's dead, so most folks aren't as jealous of him.
[02:22:22.122 --> 02:22:27.785]  So, you know, maybe 50% would attack Russo, because again, that's the weird instinct.
[02:22:27.805 --> 02:22:29.306]  They've taught us all to fight with each other.
[02:22:29.687 --> 02:22:31.508]  I instantly was, oh, how wonderful.
[02:22:32.088 --> 02:22:33.329]  Tell folks how they can listen.
[02:22:33.489 --> 02:22:33.929]  Oh, good!
[02:22:34.370 --> 02:22:40.934]  And I realize that there'll be a lot of people, though, in that Arizona PBS that won't realize that some director is probably going to lose their job over it.
[02:22:41.114 --> 02:22:42.935]  There's probably been internal fights over it.
[02:22:44.076 --> 02:22:46.857]  That this is a real rebellion.
[02:22:46.897 --> 02:22:56.744]  This is people in the system really trying to fight for America and liberty and then risking their job and going to such extremes to get it out.
[02:22:57.748 --> 02:23:09.751]  No, people will just not be able to believe that we were having a success as the Awakening Movement taking the culture back, that they'll just say, ah, that's because he's a Jew, or something like that.
[02:23:09.771 --> 02:23:13.312]  You know, that's the only reason they left that on there, because it's disinfo.
[02:23:14.493 --> 02:23:15.593]  Or they'd say something else.
[02:23:18.635 --> 02:23:23.816]  Because they don't want to actually beat the New World Order at a conscious and subconscious level.
[02:23:24.116 --> 02:23:25.997]  They don't want to act like winners.
[02:23:26.057 --> 02:23:30.118]  They don't want to say, hey, we could fix this, or, hey, we could make this better.
[02:23:31.098 --> 02:23:35.959]  You know, they just want to say, they just want to say, oh, it's all bad, there's nothing you can do, ah, screw it.
[02:23:37.019 --> 02:23:38.340]  And the feds play on that.
[02:23:38.460 --> 02:23:42.641]  I mean, we have to be ready to take over the system, have a renaissance.
[02:23:42.681 --> 02:23:43.141]  We have to
[02:23:44.426 --> 02:23:45.287]  Speak to the elite.
[02:23:45.587 --> 02:23:47.628]  We have to speak to the establishment.
[02:23:48.609 --> 02:23:50.870]  We have to reach out to people.
[02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:55.593]  We have to ask people in the establishment, do you really want to be part of this?
[02:23:55.633 --> 02:23:58.074]  Do you really want to kill the majority of the public?
[02:23:58.094 --> 02:24:00.776]  I mean, do you really want to have genetic engineering gone wild?
[02:24:00.796 --> 02:24:02.517]  I mean, do you really want to even endanger yourselves?
[02:24:04.038 --> 02:24:07.660]  Because it's very alluring to those that are in darkness who aren't completely turned over to it.
[02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:16.007]  A lot of them were just seduced through competition or whatever and got deep into it and now are scared that they can come out, that they can join us, that we can defeat the New World Order.
[02:24:16.908 --> 02:24:19.591]  And then most people are just compartmentalized and buy into the propaganda.
[02:24:19.611 --> 02:24:28.359]  Now their blinders are coming off and our information is becoming, you know, very mainstream and as cutting edge as it gets, this isn't some niche or even movement.
[02:24:28.399 --> 02:24:31.282]  This is just humans saying, wow, what's going on on this planet?
[02:24:31.542 --> 02:24:33.184]  Wow, there's this whole universe around us.
[02:24:34.798 --> 02:24:37.979]  And we want to be in fellowship together, like-minded people that want liberty.
[02:24:38.299 --> 02:24:44.821]  The enemy then goes, well, you're black, or you're white, or you're Mexican, or you're Catholic, or you're Protestant, or you're Jewish, or you're German, or you're Chinese.
[02:24:45.261 --> 02:24:46.362]  You can't be part of the group.
[02:24:46.402 --> 02:24:47.382]  You can't be part of the group.
[02:24:47.442 --> 02:24:48.422]  Only we're part of the group.
[02:24:48.562 --> 02:24:50.183]  Well, I don't totally agree with everything he says.
[02:24:51.103 --> 02:24:56.625]  We have to get past that and come together against anything that's dehumanizing.
[02:24:57.483 --> 02:25:11.148]  You know, it doesn't matter if it's black people, Jews, Easter bunnies, chupacabras that run the New World Order, we say we're against unelected regional government taking control of our local governments and taking the power of the people away.
[02:25:11.669 --> 02:25:22.513]  You say that to people and 99.9% are going to say, absolutely, no matter what color they are, what religion they are, I want local government control, I don't want an unelected regional corporate controlled thing taking my freedom.
[02:25:22.973 --> 02:25:24.154]  We're against agenda 21.
[02:25:25.473 --> 02:25:29.396]  Or, I don't want unelected international bodies setting up deals to use U.S.
[02:25:29.416 --> 02:25:32.438]  troops on the streets of America as part of a NAFTA-SPP deal.
[02:25:33.239 --> 02:25:36.121]  And now Congress is saying, hey, you're gonna use military on the streets?
[02:25:36.141 --> 02:25:36.882]  We didn't approve that.
[02:25:38.021 --> 02:25:38.241]  See?
[02:25:39.001 --> 02:25:42.323]  Instead of the, oh, you're for the Zionist, huh?
[02:25:42.343 --> 02:25:43.723]  You didn't say it was Zionist.
[02:25:44.023 --> 02:25:51.807]  Hey, I'm just saying I want to work with everybody and be friendly, and I just want to say we don't want troops on the streets.
[02:25:51.847 --> 02:25:54.488]  It's a violation of posse comitatus, and Congress didn't approve it.
[02:25:55.208 --> 02:25:56.529]  Don't we all agree that's a bad thing?
[02:25:56.829 --> 02:25:57.829]  Don't we all agree that's tyranny?
[02:25:57.869 --> 02:25:58.650]  Yeah, we all agree.
[02:25:58.670 --> 02:25:59.190]  We all agree.
[02:25:59.450 --> 02:26:00.390]  Well, then a Fed jumps up.
[02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:01.711]  Jews!
[02:26:02.371 --> 02:26:03.151]  Or Catholics!
[02:26:03.191 --> 02:26:04.052]  He's a Catholic!
[02:26:04.312 --> 02:26:05.212]  He's one of them!
[02:26:05.252 --> 02:26:06.733]  He works for the black Pope!
[02:26:07.133 --> 02:26:09.694]  Then you find out the guy saying that actually is an Israeli operative.
[02:26:10.854 --> 02:26:15.456]  You know, and then I'm not going to go hate and only attack on Israel just because I've got Mossad after me.
[02:26:15.476 --> 02:26:18.297]  I mean, look at who's being attacked, folks.
[02:26:18.357 --> 02:26:19.377]  Look at who they're after.
[02:26:19.437 --> 02:26:20.838]  Look at who they're going after.
[02:26:20.858 --> 02:26:21.538]  It's me!
[02:26:22.859 --> 02:26:25.800]  And it's anybody else that has love in their heart and is really trying to affect change.
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:29.361]  All right, before everybody hangs up, I'll take these final calls of the year.
[02:26:29.461 --> 02:26:31.782]  Russell in Texas and then Carol in Montana.
[02:26:31.802 --> 02:26:32.402]  Go ahead, Russell.
[02:26:33.723 --> 02:26:36.625]  Hey Alex, it's Russell, Weird Magazine in South Texas, how you doing?
[02:26:36.805 --> 02:26:39.527]  Hey bro, great guy, great magazine, how you doing?
[02:26:40.207 --> 02:26:45.911]  Good man, I just wanted to tell you, you got me cracking up over here man, I'm glad you're showing love for the Easter Bunny and Chupacabra.
[02:26:47.832 --> 02:26:49.693]  Absolutely, that's who controls Al-Qaeda.
[02:26:50.493 --> 02:26:52.875]  Easter Bunnies, hey, hey, Easter Bunnies is real.
[02:26:53.875 --> 02:26:55.557]  Easter Bunnies is real as Al-Cieda.
[02:26:57.558 --> 02:26:59.379]  And Adam Gadon.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.422]  Listen, Alex, great year, great show.
[02:27:04.502 --> 02:27:05.843]  I listen every day, man.
[02:27:05.863 --> 02:27:07.844]  I don't get to call in as much as I'd like to.
[02:27:07.864 --> 02:27:13.068]  I'm running the magazine down here, but I mean, you've affected a lot of change this year.
[02:27:13.128 --> 02:27:15.310]  I think I've done it as well with the magazine this year.
[02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:16.491]  It's been a great year.
[02:27:16.511 --> 02:27:21.094]  I agree with you earlier, and I'm as leery of 09 as you are.
[02:27:22.615 --> 02:27:28.237]  But I think 08 is going to be a great year and, man, keep it up.
[02:27:28.338 --> 02:27:29.998]  I just want to add a couple comments.
[02:27:31.519 --> 02:27:37.842]  You know, everything is going digital, Alex, with the TV series in, I guess, January.
[02:27:38.362 --> 02:27:42.984]  And I'm wondering, you know, is this whole everything going digital?
[02:27:43.024 --> 02:27:45.705]  Does it have any effect with the emergency alert system?
[02:27:46.025 --> 02:28:13.364]  Yes, the EAS in 96 takes over all cable TV, radio, unless it's micros, and with the digital, what that does is it makes a lot of AM and FM go out of business because a lot of these stations are barely hanging on, you know, the thousands of mom and pops and they can't afford a, you know, new digital transmitter or the new permitting from the FCC, you know, for say an FM station, that might cost a half a million bucks, a million bucks.
[02:28:14.225 --> 02:28:15.906]  And so it's a way to shut them down.
[02:28:16.006 --> 02:28:18.529]  Also it's better for the mind control patterns.
[02:28:18.569 --> 02:28:20.070]  They flicker, everything they do.
[02:28:20.450 --> 02:28:21.691]  And this is mind control.
[02:28:21.712 --> 02:28:22.572]  Hold on, let me tell folks.
[02:28:22.612 --> 02:28:24.014]  This is mind control too right here.
[02:28:25.255 --> 02:28:27.357]  We're going to run more slower images in the background.
[02:28:27.377 --> 02:28:29.819]  This is kind of a news background thing we do.
[02:28:29.879 --> 02:28:35.544]  And the reason it's mind control is it gives more action on the screen
[02:28:36.585 --> 02:28:40.767]  And so it makes people to be able to take in multiple feeds of information.
[02:28:40.827 --> 02:28:42.909]  It makes you switch into a subconscious mode.
[02:28:43.229 --> 02:28:44.369]  Now this doesn't do it fully.
[02:28:45.050 --> 02:28:48.311]  One thing in the background really just keeps people's interest.
[02:28:48.972 --> 02:29:01.399]  But when they put two or three screens in the background with say bullfighting going on and a plane crashing and people at a football game behind me and then scrolling in front of me and then a blue mist up here with an American flag.
[02:29:02.159 --> 02:29:06.852]  I mean, this is taught in school, in RTF, in the higher degrees.
[02:29:08.456 --> 02:29:11.258]  This all, to where the mind can't watch that.
[02:29:11.278 --> 02:29:12.519]  It's like watching 10 TV sets.
[02:29:12.779 --> 02:29:24.146]  So you switch into subconscious mode and now all of it, there we go, we got a little bit more of that going on, all of it then bombards and so now your rational mind can't analyze it and it goes straight through.
[02:29:24.666 --> 02:29:27.728]  So I've been meaning to go with some more newsy backgrounds.
[02:29:27.768 --> 02:29:28.929]  This is just a news feed we have.
[02:29:28.949 --> 02:29:30.390]  We're going to get rid of this soon.
[02:29:30.410 --> 02:29:31.670]  We'll bring it back from time to time.
[02:29:32.791 --> 02:29:35.113]  But that is a form of mind control.
[02:29:36.013 --> 02:29:49.845]  But again, it's only meant by the establishment to keep attention and then divert your conscious mind, so then verbally, with the semantics, they put in the disinfo, and then that goes into your subconscious.
[02:29:49.926 --> 02:29:59.014]  Rather, we are putting out the truth with this in the background, but it is borderline unethical, and so that's why I'm announcing it here and letting folks know about it.
[02:29:59.034 --> 02:29:59.214]  Go ahead.
[02:29:59.898 --> 02:30:14.297]  Well, and the second point I wanted to make is, I mean, I've heard a lot of, I have a lot of friends that have, you know, thought of, and I haven't heard you speak to this at all this year, but I mean, I'll go ahead and mention it on your show here, but I mean, I've heard some people mention
[02:30:15.098 --> 02:30:25.383]  Oh, Barack Hussein Obama, he's the Antichrist and all of this, you know, and oh, and the way people worship him in Newsweek articles and all of this, the savior of the world and all of this.
[02:30:26.503 --> 02:30:33.046]  And I don't know if that's true, but I did notice that Barack Hussein Obama has 18 letters in it.
[02:30:33.086 --> 02:30:34.667]  You divide that by three, it's six.
[02:30:35.147 --> 02:30:36.067]  Yeah.
[02:30:36.087 --> 02:30:37.048]  Three names, six, six, six.
[02:30:37.128 --> 02:30:40.269]  I don't know, I'm just speculating there, but I'm just throwing that out there at you.
[02:30:40.629 --> 02:30:42.570]  Hey Russell, fire out your website for folks.
[02:30:43.294 --> 02:30:45.136]  Yeah, it's weirdmagazine.com.
[02:30:45.236 --> 02:30:46.857]  I need you to update that site.
[02:30:46.998 --> 02:30:49.800]  Really, folks can get in touch with us at MySpace.
[02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:54.725]  That seems to be the net most of the activities on the MySpace.com forward slash weirdmagazine.
[02:30:54.745 --> 02:30:56.066]  All right, buddy, good to hear from you.
[02:30:56.086 --> 02:30:56.767]  Have a great year.
[02:30:56.787 --> 02:31:00.831]  I want to take one final call from Carol in Montana here in just a moment.
[02:31:02.432 --> 02:31:03.513]  But I was just thinking here.
[02:31:03.533 --> 02:31:06.976]  I was just thinking about
[02:31:08.473 --> 02:31:10.715]  You know, the whole Antichrist thing with Barack Obama.
[02:31:11.195 --> 02:31:13.657]  There are many Antichrists, the Bible says.
[02:31:13.677 --> 02:31:28.146]  And whether you believe the Bible or not, I mean, they really did, you know, 2,000 years ago, revelations about a mark in the hand or the forehead to buy and sell, and big metal machines dropping firebombs out, and explosions the size of mountains.
[02:31:29.392 --> 02:31:30.972]  World leaders and ten kingdoms.
[02:31:31.453 --> 02:31:35.654]  And then you see the Club of Rome and the UN saying we'll be under ten world kingdoms.
[02:31:35.674 --> 02:31:39.355]  They use the word kingdom and you'll have a mark and they call it digital angel.
[02:31:39.415 --> 02:31:41.956]  And people say, well that's predictive programming.
[02:31:41.976 --> 02:31:45.317]  You know, they planted that 2,000 years ago and now they're doing it.
[02:31:46.477 --> 02:31:46.957]  Whatever!
[02:31:47.338 --> 02:31:49.319]  Okay, I mean, the thing is, it's heavy duty, folks.
[02:31:49.839 --> 02:31:51.860]  I mean, it is HEAVY DUTY.
[02:31:52.700 --> 02:32:07.248]  And I've never seen an American president, especially while they're still alive, I mean, even Roosevelt after he was dead, or Kennedy after they were dead, it wasn't this endless, the one, the savior, the king, the god, you know, to where it doesn't matter what happens with the economy, it doesn't matter, just do what he says and he'll fix it.
[02:32:07.648 --> 02:32:08.929]  They're certainly setting him up.
[02:32:08.989 --> 02:32:12.371]  Now, they may destroy him down the line, but I've never seen something like this.
[02:32:12.451 --> 02:32:13.231]  This is Hitlerian.
[02:32:16.869 --> 02:32:21.532]  So, Barack Obama.
[02:32:21.672 --> 02:32:24.413]  It is bad news written all over that guy.
[02:32:24.954 --> 02:32:27.455]  And he's betraying the people that voted for him at every front.
[02:32:27.475 --> 02:32:28.115]  They just still don't care.
[02:32:28.135 --> 02:32:29.216]  They go, I don't care.
[02:32:29.276 --> 02:32:29.816]  I love him.
[02:32:30.817 --> 02:32:31.537]  Oh, I don't care.
[02:32:31.838 --> 02:32:33.318]  Go ahead and expand NAFTA and GATT.
[02:32:33.338 --> 02:32:34.419]  Go ahead and take the guns.
[02:32:34.719 --> 02:32:36.020]  Go ahead and attack more nations.
[02:32:36.060 --> 02:32:37.201]  Go ahead and spy on me.
[02:32:37.561 --> 02:32:38.341]  He's black!
[02:32:38.401 --> 02:32:39.402]  It's a change!
[02:32:39.822 --> 02:32:40.643]  It's a change!
[02:32:41.523 --> 02:32:42.784]  And it's sick, I know that.
[02:32:42.804 --> 02:32:45.344]  They're like, what are you for, McCain?
[02:32:45.364 --> 02:32:45.405]  No!
[02:32:46.585 --> 02:32:48.266]  They owned them both, don't you understand that?
[02:32:48.286 --> 02:32:49.506]  It's like a Don King fight.
[02:32:50.366 --> 02:32:53.648]  Uh, Carol in Montana, last caller of 2008!
[02:32:54.228 --> 02:32:55.528]  Alright for Montana!
[02:32:55.568 --> 02:32:55.948]  Hell yeah!
[02:33:01.129 --> 02:33:04.871]  Hey Alex, I gotta comment you on helping all of us people out there.
[02:33:04.951 --> 02:33:07.292]  I don't know what in the world we would do without a person like you.
[02:33:07.372 --> 02:33:09.173]  Don't you let that trash get you down.
[02:33:09.513 --> 02:33:10.813]  I don't even bother with trash.
[02:33:10.874 --> 02:33:12.494]  I don't waste my time talking about them.
[02:33:12.574 --> 02:33:14.715]  I don't waste my breath talking back to them.
[02:33:15.035 --> 02:33:15.616]  Blow it off.
[02:33:15.976 --> 02:33:17.176]  We know good from bad.
[02:33:17.356 --> 02:33:18.397]  Don't let them get you down.
[02:33:18.877 --> 02:33:20.338]  My problem is this.
[02:33:20.658 --> 02:33:22.759]  Hold on, it doesn't get me down when I'm attacked.
[02:33:23.639 --> 02:33:24.420]  For myself.
[02:33:25.952 --> 02:33:31.256]  My ego is there and it's a propulsion system, but it's a very small part of my propulsion system now.
[02:33:31.316 --> 02:33:47.146]  My overall love of humanity, the species, my love affair with creativity, my love affair with beauty of all forms, and just basic human decency and honor and our interesting history and what's coming in the future, and my love of my children, wanting them to have a better future.
[02:33:48.167 --> 02:33:49.648]  That is what drives me.
[02:33:49.708 --> 02:33:52.390]  But then I'm sad for people
[02:33:52.890 --> 02:33:53.931]  That I can't work with.
[02:33:54.031 --> 02:33:59.334]  I'm sad for people that have tried to destroy me and tried to bring me down, whether they're agents or not.
[02:33:59.434 --> 02:34:07.119]  I'm sad that they're mentally ill, because most of them believe a false little fake thing they make up.
[02:34:07.159 --> 02:34:08.860]  You know, that's why they're failures.
[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:11.242]  That's why they're unhappy, because they're not into the real world.
[02:34:11.462 --> 02:34:12.843]  They're into a delusion.
[02:34:13.483 --> 02:34:17.926]  You know, kind of like a child in dress-up, you know, who's posing.
[02:34:18.547 --> 02:34:19.968]  And so that's why I'm sad.
[02:34:20.956 --> 02:34:21.236]  Go ahead.
[02:34:21.276 --> 02:34:24.699]  Well, you're definitely a person above me because I'm not bad over trash.
[02:34:24.859 --> 02:34:25.760]  I'm done with trash.
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:29.423]  There's too much evil in this earth right now for the good to even try to survive.
[02:34:30.224 --> 02:34:33.507]  And I mean, you are over and above me, well over and above me.
[02:34:34.047 --> 02:34:36.830]  My problem is this, Alex, and this is really sincere.
[02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:40.974]  The total population of the state of Montana maybe equals a million people.
[02:34:41.314 --> 02:34:44.236]  I believe that they are up here just guinea pigging the hell out of us.
[02:34:44.276 --> 02:34:45.898]  And the reason I say this is in the last
[02:34:46.358 --> 02:34:54.645]  It started last February where our skies occasionally would turn purple and we know that that is the harp towers and they were turning them on and off and playing all the games.
[02:34:54.745 --> 02:34:59.008]  I have a farm and a ranch up here and I have cows that were literally going lethargic on me.
[02:34:59.449 --> 02:35:01.210]  Going off of feed for two and three days.
[02:35:01.550 --> 02:35:10.097]  A bull that you could normally not even walk up to but when those towers are on hot and heavy you can walk up to him and you can see in his hives that he wants to move and he wants to run and he can't.
[02:35:11.018 --> 02:35:11.578]  No, I know.
[02:35:11.678 --> 02:35:13.040]  I'm not expanding on that.
[02:35:14.136 --> 02:35:25.922]  All over the nation, they're fluoridating small towns, and then everybody's cows and horses die because they're drinking so much water, and then they take them into the state vets and they go, yeah, fluoride poisoning, you know.
[02:35:26.202 --> 02:35:29.924]  And the government just laughs and goes, that's right, keep drinking it, you sons of bitches!
[02:35:30.404 --> 02:35:32.425]  Just keep drinking it, we're going to murder your ass!
[02:35:32.686 --> 02:35:33.846]  We're going to murder your ass!
[02:35:33.866 --> 02:35:36.267]  I mean, we've just got murdering psychos in control!
[02:35:36.287 --> 02:35:38.789]  I mean, I want to stop these bastards!
[02:35:39.793 --> 02:35:42.714]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:35:42.734 --> 02:35:43.794]  You're really worked up today.
[02:35:43.934 --> 02:35:45.174]  This makes me sick, man.
[02:35:47.255 --> 02:35:50.195]  I'm gonna put this poison in your food, you're gonna damn well like it!
[02:35:50.656 --> 02:35:51.476]  I'm the government!
[02:35:51.736 --> 02:35:52.456]  Oh God!
[02:35:52.476 --> 02:35:53.856]  I mean, it's just sick!
[02:35:54.616 --> 02:35:56.357]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:35:56.717 --> 02:36:00.218]  I mean, we're talking Montana, we're talking ranches, we're talking well water.
[02:36:00.298 --> 02:36:02.938]  Okay, we're also talking no cable TV.
[02:36:03.138 --> 02:36:05.539]  We have Antenna out on the outside of our house.
[02:36:06.119 --> 02:36:10.181]  Okay, they hit these heart towers, our skies are all purple and black.
[02:36:10.501 --> 02:36:12.803]  I mean, this has been like this for the last two months.
[02:36:12.943 --> 02:36:16.905]  Every single day we have, I call it the piss boys, spraying the chemicals over the top of us.
[02:36:17.405 --> 02:36:22.427]  One has been on us all year long, and we get two, and then on Fridays we get three and four of them.
[02:36:22.447 --> 02:36:24.228]  But they just literally shut our sky off.
[02:36:24.288 --> 02:36:28.510]  Our great governor, who runs around wannabe movie star, won't do a damn thing about this.
[02:36:28.530 --> 02:36:29.191]  The people of this...
[02:36:29.751 --> 02:36:30.991]  No, no, they're doing it.
[02:36:51.576 --> 02:37:02.459]  They're doing weather modification, they're doing barium salts, aluminum sprays, they're spraying biologicals, and now the guy, and listen, I appreciate your call, good last call of the year, Carol, from Montana.
[02:37:04.359 --> 02:37:12.841]  They have the high altitude aerosol spraying programs with all the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture, and they admit that they're manipulating the weather?
[02:37:12.861 --> 02:37:18.863]  And all these years, and then they show satellite photos of how they were spraying off California?
[02:37:20.219 --> 02:37:23.040]  And they put it in children's textbooks now, in the high school textbooks.
[02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:26.661]  They have multiple versions the feds put out, you know, the federal approved.
[02:37:27.442 --> 02:37:30.483]  Say, we're spraying the skies to keep the earth safe from global warming.
[02:37:30.843 --> 02:37:35.764]  And then you call the FAA and they go, you're a conspiracy theorist, that doesn't exist.
[02:37:35.784 --> 02:37:39.006]  You're like, I have a government textbook that says you're doing it and I have all these universities.
[02:37:39.026 --> 02:37:41.026]  They just go, uh-uh, we're not.
[02:37:41.587 --> 02:37:42.227]  You're crazy.
[02:37:42.687 --> 02:37:46.808]  And we go, but okay, well we have hundreds of newspapers saying that you set up a world government and it's good.
[02:37:49.383 --> 02:37:51.586]  You know, and they go, no, that isn't in there.
[02:37:51.926 --> 02:38:00.336]  And that young man we had on a few days ago, it's in this textbook, World Government, New World Order's good, chapter's called New World Order, and he went and complained, and they said, it doesn't say that.
[02:38:00.456 --> 02:38:02.719]  And he said, yeah, it says it right here, and they go, no.
[02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:05.742]  I mean, so it's like, it's like zombies, man!
[02:38:05.782 --> 02:38:09.387]  It's like, they're all mentally ill going around saying, we're not seeing this happening.
[02:38:10.965 --> 02:38:14.489]  And, you know, the foreign troops, they've announced they're going to use foreign troops in America.
[02:38:14.529 --> 02:38:19.273]  It's in major newspapers, and then you say you don't want it, and they say, it doesn't exist.
[02:38:19.874 --> 02:38:26.460]  In fact, I've got an article right here, Military Backpedals on Troops in America.
[02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:34.028]  It's in Infowars.com, and it's got links to General Victor E. Reinhardt, or Renard,
[02:38:36.100 --> 02:38:44.333]  Junior recently told a press conference and it links to his press conference and he goes, well the troops are going to be on the streets but only to help you.
[02:38:44.934 --> 02:38:49.641]  And yes, they're here in case there's a chemical or bio attack and don't worry, only the National Guard will do law enforcement.
[02:38:50.393 --> 02:38:52.834]  But they're absorbing the National Guard under a federal.
[02:38:53.474 --> 02:38:55.015]  So, see, he's running a PSYOP.
[02:38:55.055 --> 02:38:56.396]  It's all about deception.
[02:38:56.716 --> 02:38:57.996]  And they give each other pats on the backs.
[02:38:58.236 --> 02:39:00.117]  Great job lying to the enemy, General.
[02:39:00.577 --> 02:39:01.558]  We're bringing them down.
[02:39:01.878 --> 02:39:03.719]  God, you ought to see my Swiss bank account.
[02:39:03.759 --> 02:39:05.159]  It's going well right now.
[02:39:05.819 --> 02:39:08.200]  I mean, you know, these guys are just so sick.
[02:39:08.281 --> 02:39:08.961]  It's funny.
[02:39:10.662 --> 02:39:14.443]  And they've got all these well-meaning troops that they're slowly twisting and brainwashing.
[02:39:14.763 --> 02:39:16.964]  Well, yeah, the Marines are out running checkpoints.
[02:39:16.984 --> 02:39:18.625]  You're not for drunk drivers, are you?
[02:39:19.417 --> 02:39:23.838]  Well, yeah, the Army's out with the jaws of life helping people get out of car wrecks.
[02:39:23.918 --> 02:39:27.139]  I mean, America needs help and the Army's here to help!
[02:39:29.459 --> 02:39:32.120]  So all these years they denied they were doing it, and now they're doing it.
[02:39:32.700 --> 02:39:35.880]  And they announce all over they're doing it and say, uh, but it's not bad.
[02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:40.541]  And Congress is in the news saying, well, wait, we didn't authorize this.
[02:39:40.581 --> 02:39:44.942]  And they're just going, you need to read PDD 51, you sure as hell did!
[02:39:45.022 --> 02:39:45.843]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:39:46.103 --> 02:39:47.663]  Well, you don't run nothing!
[02:39:48.655 --> 02:39:49.856]  Let me tell you something, Congress.
[02:39:50.877 --> 02:39:55.240]  The bank accounts are almost drained, and when we're done with you, we're going to nerve gas your ass.
[02:39:55.461 --> 02:39:56.161]  We're the U.S.
[02:39:56.201 --> 02:39:56.742]  military.
[02:39:57.482 --> 02:39:57.882]  U.S.
[02:39:58.123 --> 02:39:59.644]  as in, we work for us.
[02:40:00.304 --> 02:40:01.385]  Not you, slave.
[02:40:03.427 --> 02:40:05.068]  I mean, this is the mindset.
[02:40:05.108 --> 02:40:07.290]  Killing people, breaking things, collateral damage.
[02:40:07.330 --> 02:40:10.012]  They don't care about a million and a half Iraqis they've killed.
[02:40:10.312 --> 02:40:12.614]  And they don't care about you and your family farm.
[02:40:13.295 --> 02:40:16.778]  And they don't care about the troops, or the police, or anybody else.
[02:40:17.198 --> 02:40:18.059]  You understand that?
[02:40:19.642 --> 02:40:25.968]  I'm going to be really tired when I get out of here, because I'm hyped up when I'm on air.
[02:40:26.069 --> 02:40:31.374]  This is almost five hours, ladies and gentlemen, with the TV as well.
[02:40:33.035 --> 02:40:33.636]  Look at Austin.
[02:40:33.656 --> 02:40:36.739]  They have warrantless checkpoints where they take blood without warrants.
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:38.781]  It's a federal program in Austin.
[02:40:39.982 --> 02:40:43.205]  And the police are all over the place running up on people's butts.
[02:40:44.301 --> 02:40:46.243]  Without their lights on, almost running you off the road.
[02:40:46.263 --> 02:40:47.364]  I mean, it's happening to me.
[02:40:47.424 --> 02:40:48.244]  I'm seeing it every day.
[02:40:48.264 --> 02:40:52.468]  I'm going to leave here in a minute and probably see cops just running up on slaves, hind ends, letting them know.
[02:40:53.108 --> 02:40:59.734]  A cop just showed up, a former DPS guy with a gun, threatening talk show host at KLBJ, where I do the Sunday show.
[02:41:01.315 --> 02:41:03.776]  Uh, it's just, I mean, I mean, it's wall-to-wall craziness.
[02:41:04.396 --> 02:41:06.616]  Cops will walk out of stores now and kind of just look at you.
[02:41:07.236 --> 02:41:08.056]  Just kind of look at the public.
[02:41:08.076 --> 02:41:09.257]  Look at this scum, Phil.
[02:41:09.337 --> 02:41:09.737]  Ha ha!
[02:41:09.877 --> 02:41:11.477]  We're just in Iraq running offs!
[02:41:11.697 --> 02:41:13.658]  We're gonna run offs on you now!
[02:41:13.938 --> 02:41:14.938]  We like evil!
[02:41:15.158 --> 02:41:15.658]  Well, you know what?
[02:41:15.678 --> 02:41:16.238]  You like evil?
[02:41:16.258 --> 02:41:18.098]  You just drink that fluoride, buster boy.
[02:41:18.279 --> 02:41:20.079]  Your masters are killing your ass, too.
[02:41:20.379 --> 02:41:21.539]  You think you're evil and wicked?
[02:41:21.579 --> 02:41:22.999]  You think you're into darkness and power?
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:24.960]  You have no idea about your masters!
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:26.341]  You understand?
[02:41:26.361 --> 02:41:28.022]  You think you're playing tough, boy?
[02:41:28.282 --> 02:41:38.952]  You're gonna find out what real evil is when you're dying of cancer, or your child's dying of cancer, you just look at the government and you just... You just love them when you're lowering that baby down in a pit.
[02:41:40.373 --> 02:41:43.556]  You could have stopped them, but you were too weak and too evil!
[02:41:46.419 --> 02:41:49.882]  Stay away orders for repeat drug offenders in North Austin.
[02:41:51.428 --> 02:41:53.469]  And they're saying they can't be in whole areas.
[02:41:54.290 --> 02:41:57.552]  They're saying the police, even if you live there, you're not allowed to walk on the streets.
[02:41:57.572 --> 02:41:58.293]  So this is how it starts.
[02:41:58.613 --> 02:41:59.214]  Curfews.
[02:41:59.254 --> 02:42:06.219]  Well, remember CNN reported those towns in Arkansas where they are just saying daytime and nighttime curfew for everybody?
[02:42:06.239 --> 02:42:07.520]  In fact, pull that up.
[02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:08.320]  People won't believe me.
[02:42:09.501 --> 02:42:12.403]  Type in 24-hour, it's on YouTube.
[02:42:12.423 --> 02:42:14.785]  It's also in the 24-hour curfew Arkansas.
[02:42:22.210 --> 02:42:23.831]  And they've got them in Oklahoma and other places.
[02:42:23.871 --> 02:42:27.274]  And the cops are just like, you're not allowed to leave your home at any time.
[02:42:27.374 --> 02:42:28.394]  We have checkpoints.
[02:42:28.775 --> 02:42:32.898]  You have to show your pay stub that you're going to work.
[02:42:33.458 --> 02:42:35.259]  After that, you go into your home.
[02:42:35.279 --> 02:42:36.980]  It's freedom, boy.
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:40.063]  That's what America's all about.
[02:42:42.925 --> 02:42:44.446]  Meanwhile, they do nothing to stop real criminals.
[02:42:45.441 --> 02:43:02.527]  In an effort to keep repeat criminals away from East Runburg Lane, Interstate 35, an area of North Austin that has been a haven for drug dealers and prostitutes, and a source of neighborhood complaints, Austin police and Travis County District Attorney's Office officials, officials, not servants, teamed up to start using stay-away orders.
[02:43:02.547 --> 02:43:03.687]  And they've got signs up everywhere.
[02:43:04.848 --> 02:43:11.390]  While their criminal cases are pending, or they're out of jail on bail, suspected drug offenders, see guilty until proven innocent,
[02:43:12.691 --> 02:43:26.574]  with stay away orders aren't allowed in the area avoiding violating the order could lend them back in jail and their behavior would be considered in addressing their sentences so they ship the drugs and society breaks down and uh...
[02:43:30.353 --> 02:43:30.854]  Yeah, that's good.
[02:43:30.874 --> 02:43:32.295]  You found the Wall Street Journal article.
[02:43:32.335 --> 02:43:35.358]  We got that up on PrisonPlanet.tv, but I want to show them the video.
[02:43:35.519 --> 02:43:37.741]  They'll just say that Wall Street Journal headline's fake.
[02:43:38.041 --> 02:43:39.703]  That's the enemy programming out there.
[02:43:39.723 --> 02:43:42.566]  I guarantee people are going to see that on YouTube, and they're going to post right under it.
[02:43:42.747 --> 02:43:43.788]  That's a lie!
[02:43:43.828 --> 02:43:44.709]  That ain't real!
[02:43:45.249 --> 02:43:50.275]  And then if somebody posts a link to the newscast, you type that headline into YouTube, you'll find the video.
[02:43:51.636 --> 02:43:58.764]  They will then say the video is fake, but then, after a few years, they'll say, well, hell yeah, you can't leave your home at any time!
[02:43:59.344 --> 02:44:00.205]  That's freedom!
[02:44:00.345 --> 02:44:01.327]  Shut up, Alex!
[02:44:01.347 --> 02:44:05.111]  Some kind of Zio-Catholic, working for the Pope!
[02:44:08.234 --> 02:44:09.055]  Alright, I'm out of control.
[02:44:09.095 --> 02:44:09.715]  I gotta end this.
[02:44:10.663 --> 02:44:11.463]  But it's the same thing.
[02:44:11.483 --> 02:44:12.503]  They're just setting it up in Austin.
[02:44:12.523 --> 02:44:14.624]  That's how they started it in the Arkansas and Oklahoma towns.
[02:44:15.284 --> 02:44:15.804]  Florida.
[02:44:16.684 --> 02:44:20.765]  Cloverport, Kentucky started the first one I saw in 1999.
[02:44:22.925 --> 02:44:24.405]  Kentucky's a weird place.
[02:44:24.705 --> 02:44:25.626]  Pretty place, but weird.
[02:44:26.886 --> 02:44:27.606]  Oh, it's ready.
[02:44:28.446 --> 02:44:30.026]  Here is the fake newscast.
[02:44:30.246 --> 02:44:30.767]  Go ahead and play it.
[02:44:30.787 --> 02:44:33.387]  I'm sure folks will say it doesn't exist.
[02:44:35.487 --> 02:44:36.788]  Here at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:44:37.768 --> 02:44:38.908]  This is Prince Campbell.
[02:44:39.285 --> 02:44:40.274]  With InstaBlogs.com
[02:44:41.664 --> 02:44:49.847]  Officers armed with military rifles have been stopping and questioning passers-by in a neighborhood plagued by violence that's been under a 24-hour curfew for a week.
[02:44:50.407 --> 02:44:52.288]  On Tuesday, the Hellenic... Alright, stop right there!
[02:44:52.328 --> 02:44:53.148]  That's... Stop, stop.
[02:44:53.168 --> 02:44:54.449]  That's somebody reporting on it.
[02:44:54.749 --> 02:44:55.889]  They're gonna say that's fake, too.
[02:44:56.390 --> 02:45:00.191]  We must... We must depro... We must force them to admit 24-hour curfew.
[02:45:00.411 --> 02:45:01.772]  That, by the way, that was the old newscast.
[02:45:01.812 --> 02:45:03.172]  It now spreads city-wide.
[02:45:03.392 --> 02:45:06.653]  As I said, the Supreme Court said, well, you can't just discriminate on one group.
[02:45:06.673 --> 02:45:08.694]  You gotta have everybody say... Like the airport.
[02:45:08.734 --> 02:45:10.595]  Okay, we'll search everybody at the airport.
[02:45:11.311 --> 02:45:13.773]  Which is, again, an even bigger violation of no due process.
[02:45:14.073 --> 02:45:15.535]  But that's the weird lawyering they do.
[02:45:16.135 --> 02:45:17.977]  Oh, we'll just violate everyone's rights.
[02:45:18.017 --> 02:45:19.378]  We'll just poke everybody's eyes out.
[02:45:20.639 --> 02:45:21.300]  Let me see.
[02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:22.341]  24 hour curfew.
[02:45:25.844 --> 02:45:26.804]  This is the good one down here.
[02:45:27.065 --> 02:45:29.587]  Helena Mayor defends curfew.
[02:45:30.668 --> 02:45:36.053]  And you can find the one where now it's the whole town and it's spread all over half the state and police running around fuming at the mouth.
[02:45:36.093 --> 02:45:36.393]  Here it is.
[02:45:39.841 --> 02:45:42.003]  My name is James Fitzgerald Valley.
[02:45:42.183 --> 02:45:44.005]  I'm the mayor of Helena, Westtown, Arkansas.
[02:45:44.505 --> 02:45:46.868]  I've been in this capacity since January the 1st of 2006.
[02:45:48.289 --> 02:45:53.494]  What led us to having this curfew or saturation zones in our community?
[02:45:54.074 --> 02:45:59.920]  Chiefly was this 10 block area involves some, I guess... I can't hear anymore.
[02:45:59.940 --> 02:46:00.641]  I can't hear anymore.
[02:46:01.550 --> 02:46:07.976]  Look, your bosses shipped in the narcotics, a huge black market to make huge profits, knowing it would bring down society.
[02:46:08.376 --> 02:46:12.860]  Just like the British shipped opium into China to corrupt the police, create massive crime waves.
[02:46:13.261 --> 02:46:15.142]  You gotta legalize the stuff, dumbass!
[02:46:16.003 --> 02:46:20.267]  That's why the bigger the drug war gets, the more drugs we have and things fall apart.
[02:46:20.487 --> 02:46:22.689]  Do you get me, you stupid piece of crap?
[02:46:23.490 --> 02:46:27.334]  You dumb son of a bitch who thinks he's so smart and thinks he knows everything?
[02:46:27.554 --> 02:46:30.517]  You jackasses claiming you're doing all this to keep us safe?
[02:46:30.797 --> 02:46:32.739]  You're the ones that ruined our society!
[02:46:33.159 --> 02:46:35.962]  You introduced the crisis so you could offer the solution!
[02:46:36.022 --> 02:46:37.563]  Excuse me, I'm not normally like this.
[02:46:37.943 --> 02:46:39.925]  This will not be like this in the first of the year show.
[02:46:39.945 --> 02:46:42.167]  I'm out of control today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:42.808 --> 02:46:43.829]  Just go back to him.
[02:46:43.869 --> 02:46:44.850]  He makes me mad.
[02:46:45.848 --> 02:46:47.249]  Just go back to the jackass!
[02:47:04.463 --> 02:47:17.252]  The point is, just Google, 24-hour curfew, I don't have time here to go through all these clips, and you'll see him searching cars, checking everybody to be able to even be in the area, and then it went citywide, and then two other towns did it, and it's all right there, and that's how it works.
[02:47:17.972 --> 02:47:23.776]  There's one where he goes, we're gonna knock a nut on your head, and then a thug, that's an exact quote, so you can go look at it if you want.
[02:47:23.796 --> 02:47:26.278]  What are you laughing at?
[02:47:26.638 --> 02:47:27.719]  I like to do voices!
[02:47:28.799 --> 02:47:29.680]  You know, I can do Bill Clinton.
[02:47:30.922 --> 02:47:32.143]  I really appreciate everything.
[02:47:32.963 --> 02:47:36.226]  Listen, how dare you say 9-11 is an inside job?
[02:47:37.106 --> 02:47:39.488]  I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[02:47:44.091 --> 02:47:44.932]  What's funny now?
[02:47:48.034 --> 02:47:50.956]  Huh?
[02:47:51.376 --> 02:47:53.858]  Oh, no.
[02:47:54.598 --> 02:47:57.020]  No, I'm not going to make fun of coworkers.
[02:47:57.140 --> 02:47:57.800]  Okay, that's enough.
[02:47:57.961 --> 02:47:58.321]  Stop it.
[02:47:59.738 --> 02:48:00.918]  Folks, that's the end of the year.
[02:48:00.998 --> 02:48:02.699]  We had a powerful transmission today.
[02:48:03.299 --> 02:48:06.200]  Rebroadcast starts now at one place, InfoWars.com.
[02:48:06.521 --> 02:48:08.201]  Please get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:48:08.221 --> 02:48:13.063]  If you're listening to the audio of this, you're missing the TV show, and your support of PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[02:48:13.083 --> 02:48:16.584]  We've still got that deal going where you can get five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:16.904 --> 02:48:25.748]  That pays for a lot of what we're doing here, and this ain't cheap, as they say, and we're going into hard times, so I hope you'll help this old squirrel out with some nuts so we can continue what we're doing.
[02:48:26.428 --> 02:48:29.690]  Alright, this is the final 10 seconds of the transmission 2008.
[02:48:31.011 --> 02:48:32.452]  God bless you all.
[02:48:33.152 --> 02:48:37.395]  See you back tomorrow and see you back on Friday and Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:48:37.795 --> 02:48:40.077]  and I'll see you at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:48:42.398 --> 02:48:46.442]  We're gonna knock a knot on the head of some of these New World Order control freak scumbags.
[02:48:46.662 --> 02:48:48.063]  Look at Bernanke and them on screen.
[02:48:48.343 --> 02:48:49.524]  Busy stealing all our money.
[02:48:49.904 --> 02:48:51.886]  I mean, how obvious are these crooks gotta get?
[02:48:51.926 --> 02:48:53.928]  They just have absolute contempt for us.
[02:48:54.348 --> 02:48:54.929]  It's pathetic.
[02:48:54.969 --> 02:48:57.191]  They got a bunch of do-gooder control freaks working for them.
[02:48:57.511 --> 02:48:58.892]  It's time to bring the scum to justice.
[02:48:58.912 --> 02:49:00.914]  Alright, that's it for 2008!
[02:49:02.115 --> 02:49:08.360]  We will see you next year in 2009 on the front lines of the Info War!
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:09.861]  I love you all!
[02:49:09.941 --> 02:49:10.502]  Bye-bye!
