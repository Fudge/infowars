[00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:08.653]  Alright, we are now into the fourth and final hour today.
[00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:10.634]  Mike Rivero leaving us in about five minutes.
[00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:12.775]  Man, I could have this guy on for four hours straight.
[00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:15.576]  And I know you love it listening to him as well.
[00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:20.398]  You can check him out on the Genesis Schedule at GCNlive.com or WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:00:20.418 --> 00:00:21.139]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.341]  Again, my websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:31.205]  We're not winning this fight, but we're certainly in this fight and gaining ground, and the enemy is losing ground.
[00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:35.248]  So we could start winning this fight against the New World Order if you get involved.
[00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:44.756]  So spread the word about the shows, the websites, what we're doing now, more than ever, and the new film, Fabled Enemies, that we just released, that Jason Bermas directed, that I produced.
[00:00:45.686 --> 00:00:50.888]  Mike, we have a cocktail of attacks on the internet, and I know you're well versed on that.
[00:00:50.928 --> 00:00:58.270]  You have one of the first alternative news websites on the web, and you exposed the Vince Foster murder from there, more than even Christopher Ruddy did.
[00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:11.115]  But yes, in closing, attacks on the web intensifying right now, and we're coming back in the next segment with We Are Change Minnesota on the scene with new breaking developments.
[00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:13.576]  But let's go back to Mike Rivera right now.
[00:01:14.912 --> 00:01:25.758]  Well, basically, as I was saying before the break, back during the Exxon amendment, it was very obvious what was going on, because a month before, Senator Exxon went before Congress to try and say, we've got to control the Internet.
[00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:29.941]  All this hardcore pornography, I mean, really gross and disgusting.
[00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:31.722]  Even for porno, it was bad.
[00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:35.244]  And it was being poured all over the Internet in very inappropriate places.
[00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:41.223]  And the internet is very self-policing and people would say to these posters, please don't put this in here, this is a cooking group!
[00:01:41.524 --> 00:01:46.148]  And these bozos would come back and say, I have a First Amendment right to put this anywhere I want, blah blah blah blah.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:53.595]  So we did a little digging and we found out these people posting all this trash all over the net were all routing through military servers and government offices.
[00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:58.815]  And sure enough, you know, a month later, Senator Exxon gets up and says, we must have control over the internet.
[00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:06.318]  Look at all these sleazy porn pictures I'm finding in cooking groups, and model airplane groups, and music groups, and the children... And let's just say what it was.
[00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:07.419]  It was people eating feces.
[00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:11.227]  Yeah, it was pretty bad stuff.
[00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:16.010]  And, of course, as soon as the Exxon Amendment came and went in Congress, the porn flood stopped.
[00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.954]  I mean, you don't get much more obvious than that, that it was a staged operation bought and paid for with your tax dollars.
[00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:29.259]  God, how do they get these guys, you know, at these PR firms and out at Cheyenne Mountain and South Common Miami and Tampa?
[00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.640]  I mean, how do they get them to really hurt this country?
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.003]  I mean, like you said, I guess they say, we're the good guys, so we can break any rule we want.
[00:02:36.943 --> 00:02:42.828]  Well, you know, if you've got enough money, you can get somebody to sell out their own country, and we've seen that throughout our entire nation's history.
[00:02:43.048 --> 00:02:44.830]  And they don't see them selling out the country.
[00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.111]  They think they're on the winning team.
[00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.252]  They think it's for the greater good.
[00:02:47.592 --> 00:02:53.497]  They can make all kinds of excuses to themselves at the bottom of those scotch glasses they're having at the end of the workday.
[00:02:53.737 --> 00:02:56.660]  But the bottom line is, they are paid liars.
[00:02:57.065 --> 00:02:59.006]  That's what public relations and spend is.
[00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:00.846]  It's paid, lying to the public.
[00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:09.909]  Hill and Knowlton did that whole incubator story that helped sell the Iraq War, and they're probably convinced themselves it was for a greater good, and bringing democracy, and blah blah blah blah.
[00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:18.051]  But the bottom line is, they take money to deliberately mislead the American people into making poor choices about what their government is doing.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.581]  Oh, it's just incredible they get away with so much of it.
[00:03:22.941 --> 00:03:32.623]  I'm going to come back and go to Steve and Josh and Steve and many others that are patiently holding, but first we're going to get about a five-minute report from Anthony Yasha.
[00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:34.203]  We are Change Minnesota.
[00:03:34.223 --> 00:03:36.684]  He's had his own run-ins with the feds for trying to cover events.
[00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:38.244]  He's also done work for me.
[00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:41.265]  He is an Infowars.com press pass carrier.
[00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:45.466]  Big developments there, so Anthony Yasha will be on with us in the next segment.
[00:03:47.148 --> 00:03:50.549]  We love having you on once a month, but once a month is not enough.
[00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.011]  I want to start getting you on every few weeks for an abbreviated interview like you did last week with Jason Bernes.
[00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:01.373]  And thanks for your help getting out ahead of that Michelle Malkin disinfo story with the truth.
[00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:05.294]  We've certainly turned the tide on them by Wednesday or Thursday and have kicked their butts.
[00:04:05.314 --> 00:04:09.256]  And now they are, even on their own radio show, admitting it was all lies now.
[00:04:09.756 --> 00:04:12.677]  So thank you for your help there, my friend, and we'll talk to you very soon.
[00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:13.939]  You got it.
[00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:14.720]  Look forward to it.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.380]  Have a good day.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.840]  You bet.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.001]  There goes Mike Rivero.
[00:04:17.061 --> 00:04:17.681]  Great guy.
[00:04:18.462 --> 00:04:19.882]  Great political brain.
[00:04:20.182 --> 00:04:24.725]  And he's one of the commentators, one of the experts in the new film, Fabled Enemies.
[00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:26.506]  Alex Jones is not in this film.
[00:04:27.526 --> 00:04:32.429]  Alex Jones was not going to be in Truth Rising.
[00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.250]  But I got arrested, so I had to be in my own film.
[00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.912]  You're going to see more films coming out with no Alex Jones.
[00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:41.645]  Why?
[00:04:41.685 --> 00:04:45.889]  Because someday you may not even hear me on the radio, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:47.890]  I just want to make films.
[00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:51.213]  We'll be right back at FabledEnemies and Infowars.com.
[00:05:01.064 --> 00:05:02.085]  But who is the enemy?
[00:05:02.586 --> 00:05:03.127]  Bin Laden.
[00:05:03.407 --> 00:05:04.388]  This is his M.O.s.
[00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:05.710]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.392]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:14.520]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.361]  Some U.S.
[00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:21.048]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:05:21.748 --> 00:05:25.191]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:27.392]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:56.108]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.

[00:06:51.573 --> 00:06:57.437]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals and businesses.
[00:06:57.737 --> 00:06:59.278]  But there is something you can do.
[00:06:59.678 --> 00:07:09.524]  Fuel Saver Incorporated's fuel enhancer formula will not only stretch each gallon of fuel further for mere pennies per treated gallon, but also cleans fuel injectors, pumps and reduces emissions.

[00:07:51.258 --> 00:07:56.323]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:58.946]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:15.102]  Okay, I'm told we've got quite a few people from We Are Change, Minnesota, 9-11 cruisers, you name it, on the line with us.
[00:08:16.484 --> 00:08:23.551]  Let's go to Anthony Yasha, who is an Infowars.com reporter, also one of the founders of We Are Change.
[00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:26.530]  Minnesota needs no introduction.
[00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.650]  They've asked Bill Clinton questions.
[00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:38.373]  Hillary Clinton, John McCain, had the Secret Service arrest him for asking John McCain a question saying his Infowars.com press passes were fake.
[00:08:38.873 --> 00:08:43.555]  They then went to Ted Anderson and basically threatened him to say that it was a fake press pass.
[00:08:44.485 --> 00:08:45.566]  Hey Alex, thanks for having us on.
[00:09:08.922 --> 00:09:10.402]  We were down at the march yesterday.
[00:09:10.422 --> 00:09:12.263]  I mean, we covered the preliminary stuff.
[00:09:12.283 --> 00:09:18.105]  We're going to try to get as much film and audio and pictures up on the web here today as soon as possible.
[00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:21.346]  But yesterday, I mean, it always could have been worse.
[00:09:22.046 --> 00:09:25.507]  If W and Chaney and those guys had shown up, it probably would have been a lot worse.
[00:09:25.647 --> 00:09:37.351]  But, I mean, they were doing mass arrests and pinning people against the river with riot cops and making them sit on the concrete for two hours and one girl actually
[00:09:38.653 --> 00:09:42.514]  Uh, urinated on herself because she had to sit there so long and they wouldn't let her move.
[00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:55.997]  Coast Guard was boarding boats, like, armed and ready to go, and they were shooting rubber bullets, not tasering people, but pepper spraying people, and it was really crazy.
[00:09:56.017 --> 00:09:57.697]  Well, this is better than the Cold War.
[00:09:57.777 --> 00:10:02.018]  Not only were they fighting a fake enemy they funded then, now they get to fight women and children.
[00:10:02.418 --> 00:10:06.079]  So imagine getting to be a macho guy in a Darth Vader outfit who just beats up women.
[00:10:06.119 --> 00:10:06.819]  It must feel good.
[00:10:08.038 --> 00:10:21.862]  Yeah, there was one yesterday, we actually got him on video, where he was pretty much, I mean the lady brought her, probably about a four year old there, and he's just telling her how stupid she was for bringing a kid to what's supposed to be a peaceful march, and it's just ridiculous.
[00:10:21.882 --> 00:10:24.043]  Well, you don't march in America, okay?
[00:10:24.063 --> 00:10:30.945]  You keep your mouth shut, you take your Prozac, you die of diabetes and cancer, you know, you take your vaccines, you roll over and die.
[00:10:30.985 --> 00:10:31.625]  That's what you do.
[00:10:32.964 --> 00:10:34.125]  You want to help America?
[00:10:34.205 --> 00:10:34.625]  Die.
[00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:35.907]  You want to help America?
[00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:36.847]  Jump off a cliff.
[00:10:37.148 --> 00:10:38.088]  Lick a boot today.
[00:10:38.108 --> 00:10:38.869]  That's how you help.
[00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:39.329]  Go ahead.
[00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.772]  That's true.
[00:10:42.432 --> 00:10:45.455]  We're definitely in full force.
[00:10:46.035 --> 00:10:51.540]  We haven't gotten a chance to get down there today yet, but I'm sure there's probably just as many police as there was yesterday.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.427]  There's definitely, I mean we got, there's some people down there trying to cause trouble and mess it up for everybody.
[00:11:00.348 --> 00:11:09.756]  We've got some pretty good footage of a group of anarchists, whatever you want to call them, running away after they had pretty much provoked the police from what we understand.
[00:11:10.957 --> 00:11:12.498]  So basically it's the same MO.
[00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:18.223]  They attack the police, and then they run back, and the foundation that brought them in always was funded by the government.
[00:11:18.243 --> 00:11:25.809]  When they've been caught red-handed, sometimes it's cop dressed up like anarchists, police dressed up like them, and then they run off, and then the police attack the peaceful crowd.
[00:11:26.826 --> 00:11:29.688]  Yeah, I'm kind of thinking that's actually what happened out at the river yesterday.
[00:11:29.708 --> 00:11:32.369]  Well, that's what mainstream media says.
[00:11:32.409 --> 00:11:45.438]  The mainstream media says that the slaves, the cattle, the scum, filth Americans got off their deviated slave path and that the god force, the lords
[00:11:46.298 --> 00:11:49.840]  Well, I mean, break down what else you've seen there, slave.
[00:12:10.976 --> 00:12:26.201]  Got Jeremiah from Ohio Changes here, Adam from Colorado Changes here, and they said, I mean, for being at both of them, that it was pretty extreme yesterday, and like I say, if Cheney or any of those guys had shown up yesterday, it would have been probably chaos.
[00:12:26.401 --> 00:12:35.284]  Now those are supreme lords, but the servants of God, the angels in black, how many angels in black?
[00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:39.746]  Oh, well, I can say probably at least
[00:12:40.478 --> 00:12:47.021]  Well, how many would you say were in black uniforms yesterday, would you say?
[00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:47.601]  I'd say maybe 3,000.
[00:12:48.061 --> 00:12:49.362]  They were literally everywhere.
[00:12:49.382 --> 00:12:55.544]  I mean, I maybe saw maybe one or two badges out of all of them.
[00:12:55.604 --> 00:12:57.905]  Now, how were the slave owners behaving?
[00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:01.907]  You mean the actual protesters?
[00:13:01.987 --> 00:13:03.528]  No, no, the police or the slave owners.
[00:13:04.568 --> 00:13:07.149]  How were the slave owners behaving?
[00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:08.970]  Most of them were actually
[00:13:09.315 --> 00:13:10.796]  Pretty decent.
[00:13:11.076 --> 00:13:13.037]  You could see even the bike cops and stuff.
[00:13:13.057 --> 00:13:17.400]  There were a lot of people that didn't want to be there, especially our Minneapolis cops.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.201]  But a lot of them, I mean, we got good footage of.
[00:13:20.281 --> 00:13:27.806]  Yeah, I heard some of them might be KGB agents because they were actually giving thumbs up to the 9-11 truthers.
[00:13:28.126 --> 00:13:29.927]  Maybe they're secretly with the terrorists.
[00:13:31.108 --> 00:13:31.748]  It could be it.
[00:13:32.068 --> 00:13:34.409]  We did actually get a couple that drove by yesterday.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.821]  Ended up just parking at a bridge.
[00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:39.161]  Sympathizers?
[00:13:39.281 --> 00:13:40.802]  They're sympathizing with terrorists?
[00:13:42.002 --> 00:13:42.502]  It could be.
[00:13:42.982 --> 00:13:44.723]  Oh my god, this is horrible news.
[00:13:46.063 --> 00:13:47.364]  I mean, tell me what they were doing.
[00:13:49.684 --> 00:13:52.205]  Well, they were just making sure they followed everybody.
[00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:55.306]  I mean, they were right up on everybody the whole time.
[00:13:56.907 --> 00:14:04.029]  But you did say that some of the lords, police lords, were thumbs-upping you, though.
[00:14:04.787 --> 00:14:06.208]  Oh yeah, there was quite a few.
[00:14:06.268 --> 00:14:11.652]  I mean, we had, like I said, we stopped at a bridge and started basically bullhorning the whole march as it went by.
[00:14:11.672 --> 00:14:24.642]  I mean, we, I can't even tell you how many people walked by when we were at camp, but we had a couple police cars on marks come by, give a thumbs up, honk when they came by, and they knew, I mean, they knew we were over there and who we were.
[00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:28.064]  Yeah, well there are some good cops.
[00:14:28.124 --> 00:14:30.946]  I had some of them do that in Denver as well, and we've seen it in New York.
[00:14:32.166 --> 00:14:37.328]  But, you know, I went to Denver to blame the police, you know, if they did something wrong.
[00:14:37.368 --> 00:14:39.309]  I mean, expecting that, because I see it everywhere else.
[00:14:39.809 --> 00:14:43.911]  And then I had to admit they were somewhat restrained there, and actually were humans.
[00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:48.193]  They didn't act like they were from Mount Olympus or something, that I was scum.
[00:14:48.933 --> 00:14:51.514]  First time I'd ever seen this, I was absolutely amazed.
[00:14:52.835 --> 00:14:57.397]  But it looks like in Minnesota that they were not as restrained, but not as bad as they could have been.
[00:14:59.198 --> 00:14:59.658]  Yeah, it was.
[00:15:00.018 --> 00:15:13.302]  I mean, besides the couple times, I mean, we were probably a lot away when they started firing the rubber bullets and stuff, and it looked like just a select group that had broken off from the actual march and gone over there and kind of provoked something, from what I heard.
[00:15:13.582 --> 00:15:16.183]  Yeah, they were throwing things at police, is what the news says.
[00:15:16.243 --> 00:15:16.983]  Is that accurate?
[00:15:17.903 --> 00:15:18.163]  Yeah.
[00:15:18.903 --> 00:15:26.685]  Well, I'm so sick of these anarchists claiming that they're not government agents or they're not hired, but they've been caught over and over again.
[00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:28.106]  I don't know about this particular group,
[00:15:29.349 --> 00:15:29.589]  Um, actually,
[00:15:57.659 --> 00:15:59.040]  They've pretty much laid off me.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.540]  I don't know.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.341]  I mean, my girlfriend got pulled over.
[00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:09.503]  She was speeding, but a couple days ago, but I guess the police were pretty... Not speeding, Al-Qaeda-ing.
[00:16:09.944 --> 00:16:16.286]  So your girlfriend was Al-Qaeda-ing, and then what happened next?
[00:16:18.447 --> 00:16:24.969]  They pretty much went through almost all the questions that the Secret Service had asked her when they came over to my house originally.
[00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:26.730]  So there's no doubt you're in a database?
[00:16:27.338 --> 00:16:31.441]  Oh yeah, because they're like, well where does Anthony work, and what does he do on these days, and where is he?
[00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:32.582]  A freedom base!
[00:16:32.682 --> 00:16:34.664]  Actually, a freedom base, not a database.
[00:16:35.144 --> 00:16:36.085]  A freedom base.
[00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.626]  I mean, that's freedom, man.
[00:16:37.646 --> 00:16:42.090]  When you get pulled over and you're in a database and they're secret policing you, man, that is really good.
[00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.991]  That's what the veterans fought and died for.
[00:16:44.011 --> 00:16:46.353]  Well, it makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.
[00:16:46.413 --> 00:16:54.759]  Well, because it's because I'm a KGB agent that I don't want to be like Russia was, or East Germany, and I don't want secret police.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.301]  But see, that's because I'm KGB.
[00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:04.447]  See, if you're against secret police and being pulled over randomly and asked questions, it's because you're... Anthony, are you a KGB agent?
[00:17:06.088 --> 00:17:06.788]  I guess I am.
[00:17:07.488 --> 00:17:09.449]  You carry a press pass from this organization.
[00:17:09.469 --> 00:17:10.590]  You must be KGB.
[00:17:11.411 --> 00:17:12.611]  It's like no way out, man.
[00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:13.332]  I've been found.
[00:17:13.492 --> 00:17:21.076]  I go to the safe house and there's a KGB there and Vladimir Putin's there patting me on the head and everything.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.903]  Oh my God, I mean, have you heard the latest that I'm actually a KGB agent?
[00:17:25.923 --> 00:17:33.408]  People are actually saying this because I went on Russian TV and said, we're sorry the neocons have snuck attack you, the American people don't want war with you.
[00:17:34.069 --> 00:17:34.789]  Now I'm evil.
[00:17:35.209 --> 00:17:36.030]  I should believe that.
[00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.671]  No, no, Russia attacked them.
[00:17:37.711 --> 00:17:38.292]  Did you know that?
[00:17:39.913 --> 00:17:40.653]  Here, here, here, here.
[00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:42.415]  I'll be a good patriotic American.
[00:17:42.655 --> 00:17:43.616]  Some blogs and things.
[00:17:44.216 --> 00:17:45.577]  I'll be a good patriotic American.
[00:17:45.897 --> 00:17:48.019]  Saddam had thousands of nuclear weapons.
[00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:49.080]  He tried to use them.
[00:17:49.938 --> 00:17:52.661]  Russia snuck attack Georgia and killed millions.
[00:17:53.882 --> 00:17:56.085]  George Bush is a great American.
[00:17:57.086 --> 00:17:59.248]  He promised we would be back in ten years.
[00:17:59.288 --> 00:18:00.850]  He never said we'd be out of Iraq quick.
[00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.712]  He never said mission accomplished.
[00:18:04.013 --> 00:18:04.894]  Man, I'm just sick.
[00:18:04.954 --> 00:18:07.136]  I want to lock up every liberal in this country.
[00:18:07.156 --> 00:18:09.038]  I want to put them in prison camps.
[00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.571]  I think torture is good.
[00:18:11.631 --> 00:18:14.713]  I think the memo saying torture small children is good.
[00:18:14.773 --> 00:18:16.413]  That's pro-America!
[00:18:17.074 --> 00:18:19.995]  And anybody that's against it needs to be tortured and put in a camp.
[00:18:20.816 --> 00:18:24.858]  And I'm glad the Secret Service is asking you questions and pulling your girlfriend over, Anthony Yasha.
[00:18:25.318 --> 00:18:28.800]  How dare you in America go ask politicians questions?
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.821]  That is un-American, boy!
[00:18:31.781 --> 00:18:36.944]  Anything else you un-American piece of filth, you want to report here before we slam your ass in a black site.
[00:18:38.735 --> 00:18:44.599]  Well, um, I know a couple of these other guys might want to say something quick, but I'll just say we're going to get these videos up.
[00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:46.700]  We've got a lot of really great video.
[00:18:47.181 --> 00:18:47.361]  Good.
[00:18:47.441 --> 00:18:52.424]  Give us the dirty terrorist website, you un-American piece of trash.
[00:18:53.525 --> 00:18:55.306]  No, I don't want to hear about the Bill of Rights from you.
[00:18:55.326 --> 00:18:56.687]  That's a terrorist document.
[00:18:57.047 --> 00:18:57.688]  Shut up!
[00:18:57.748 --> 00:18:58.668]  It never existed!
[00:18:58.869 --> 00:19:04.613]  It's a conspiracy theory from your fat conspiracy-married mouth, you sleeper agent, KGB!
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.721]  Shut up, KGB!
[00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:10.862]  Now what other KGB you got, Anthony Yasha?
[00:19:11.562 --> 00:19:13.423]  Give me that KGB website first.
[00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:21.466]  MNChange.org MNChange, that stands for Manchurian Commissar.
[00:19:22.666 --> 00:19:23.046]  Get it!
[00:19:25.447 --> 00:19:26.008]  Dear God!
[00:19:27.695 --> 00:19:28.516]  I can't believe it.
[00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:31.739]  I've uncovered a nest of hardcore communists.
[00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:36.303]  Folks, I'm not going to stand by for communist indoctrination and infiltration anymore.
[00:19:36.903 --> 00:19:40.386]  I'm going to expose every one of you that's against attacking Iran and Russia.
[00:19:40.586 --> 00:19:43.008]  You're a bunch of blood-sucking commies.
[00:19:43.048 --> 00:19:47.032]  We're going to skip this break from the InfoWars.com streams to fight commies!
[00:19:49.383 --> 00:19:50.583]  I'm going to fight some commies.
[00:19:50.623 --> 00:19:51.084]  Here we go.
[00:19:51.584 --> 00:19:53.044]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[00:19:53.124 --> 00:19:54.025]  Cut the audio!
[00:19:54.745 --> 00:19:56.085]  John Harmon's with a communist.
[00:19:56.325 --> 00:19:57.406]  Let's get him on the line.
[00:19:57.846 --> 00:19:59.707]  John Harmon, are you some kind of sleeper agent?
[00:20:02.488 --> 00:20:03.548]  Yes, sir, I am.
[00:20:04.988 --> 00:20:07.429]  Damn right, you were raised in the Soviet Union, weren't you?
[00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:09.290]  Oh yeah, you know it.
[00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:15.080]  You were just waiting to launch your dasherly attack with that bastard Alex Jones!
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.400]  And this Anthony Yasha is disgusting!
[00:20:18.081 --> 00:20:20.021]  How dare him not want to torture small children!
[00:20:20.321 --> 00:20:21.542]  Un-American piece of filth!
[00:20:21.822 --> 00:20:22.582]  How dare you!
[00:20:22.742 --> 00:20:24.123]  HOW DARE YOU YASHA!
[00:20:25.243 --> 00:20:25.383]  AHHH!
[00:20:26.343 --> 00:20:28.064]  No, it's incredible you're un-American!
[00:20:28.544 --> 00:20:31.585]  You don't want to pay a global carbon tax either, that's because you're for the New World Order!
[00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:36.927]  Alright, let's go ahead and... Anthony, you got any other terrorists you want to put on the line?
[00:20:37.782 --> 00:20:38.363]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:20:38.523 --> 00:20:41.345]  I think Jeremiah from Ohio would like to jump on.
[00:20:41.886 --> 00:20:44.628]  Jeremiah, now is he with that evil KGB out of Ohio?
[00:20:44.648 --> 00:20:45.229]  Yeah.
[00:20:45.249 --> 00:20:48.591]  Alright, we are Change KGB Ohio.
[00:20:49.632 --> 00:20:50.853]  Okay, thanks man.
[00:20:50.873 --> 00:20:52.034]  Alright, go ahead Communist.
[00:20:53.396 --> 00:20:55.437]  Hi, this is Jeremiah from Ohio Change.
[00:20:55.878 --> 00:20:57.419]  Hey man, tell us what happened over there.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.663]  Yeah, yesterday we got a call from a friend of ours.
[00:21:02.168 --> 00:21:04.950]  That she was just being tear gassed downtown from us.
[00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.191]  That's freedom?
[00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:07.032]  You're against that?
[00:21:07.412 --> 00:21:08.433]  Do you support Al Qaeda?
[00:21:10.574 --> 00:21:12.776]  Are you some kind of KGB officer?
[00:21:12.796 --> 00:21:12.836]  No.
[00:21:14.297 --> 00:21:16.598]  Alright, well they love gassing her.
[00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:17.699]  What happens next?
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.322]  Yeah, dude, we basically got down there like an hour after.
[00:21:21.342 --> 00:21:22.423]  I mean, we got down there.
[00:21:22.443 --> 00:21:26.205]  We're right by the river and we just noticed that by at least 100, 150 or more, we're just
[00:21:29.179 --> 00:21:36.320]  I'm sitting there on the cement right next to the river being detained by like... They made them put their hands up in Denver.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:36.901]  That's freedom.
[00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:39.341]  Men in black uniforms marching, citizens with their hands up.
[00:21:39.621 --> 00:21:40.381]  That's freedom.
[00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:43.022]  And if you don't like it, you're a KGB agent.
[00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:45.102]  Go ahead.
[00:21:45.622 --> 00:21:49.343]  Basically I'm detained there on the ground for about 2-3 hours.
[00:21:50.423 --> 00:21:57.105]  And they started taking people away one by one and started questioning them for what they were doing.
[00:21:57.205 --> 00:21:58.885]  And people were just trying to get to our concert.
[00:21:59.477 --> 00:22:00.917]  And some people are just protesting.
[00:22:00.957 --> 00:22:03.418]  Some people just got caught up in the scene out of nowhere.
[00:22:03.638 --> 00:22:03.858]  Nope!
[00:22:04.018 --> 00:22:07.539]  They're every one of them secret KGB sleepers and you know it!
[00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:12.600]  You're trying to cover up for KGB operatives that were trying to launch sneak attacks on Georgia!
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.021]  On the peach plantations!
[00:22:16.701 --> 00:22:19.461]  Didn't you hear Russia attacked the United States a month ago on 888?
[00:22:21.022 --> 00:22:21.622]  Yes, I did.
[00:22:21.762 --> 00:22:23.442]  I just came out of nowhere.
[00:22:23.502 --> 00:22:27.243]  I know they were planning all these attacks out of nowhere and
[00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.915]  It just came out of nowhere just a few nights ago when that happened.
[00:22:31.935 --> 00:22:34.758]  It just came out one night and this happened.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:37.321]  That's right.
[00:22:37.341 --> 00:22:42.246]  Yeah, also we're covering the rally for Republic for today.
[00:22:42.266 --> 00:22:44.649]  Okay, tell us about that.
[00:22:48.274 --> 00:22:56.680]  Us, um, and, um, um, we are changed actually was able, um, get backstage and actually I'm able to, um, talk to, um, Tucker Carlson and ask him a question.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.360]  A great American.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.202]  He hates, he hates the Bill of Rights.
[00:23:00.022 --> 00:23:00.363]  Yeah.
[00:23:00.743 --> 00:23:01.323]  Connie's good.
[00:23:01.343 --> 00:23:02.824]  Yeah, we were able to ask him.
[00:23:02.844 --> 00:23:04.425]  Gotta eradicate that Connie document.
[00:23:04.465 --> 00:23:06.127]  That's so kind of document.
[00:23:07.227 --> 00:23:11.871]  Yeah, we were able to ask him, um, if he has supported any, um, investigations as of, uh, into 9-11.
[00:23:13.081 --> 00:23:17.284]  And yeah, he said he supports as many investigations as possible.
[00:23:18.665 --> 00:23:20.026]  Investigations of you?
[00:23:21.727 --> 00:23:22.008]  Yeah.
[00:23:23.228 --> 00:23:28.492]  I've been being a bit sarcastic here, playing the part of, because people are going to take this on the web and say I meant it.
[00:23:29.093 --> 00:23:35.757]  We're not really KGB agents, we're patriotic Americans fighting people that are setting things up like the KGB had in Russia.
[00:23:36.478 --> 00:23:39.060]  And we're talking right now to some folks from We Are Change.
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.762]  Now, tell us your name again?
[00:23:42.739 --> 00:23:45.443]  I'm Jeremiah Van Buren from Ohio Change.
[00:23:45.663 --> 00:23:47.666]  You actually used my megaphone back in Denver.
[00:23:47.786 --> 00:23:48.267]  That's right.
[00:23:49.468 --> 00:23:50.951]  Oh, let's talk some about that.
[00:23:51.692 --> 00:23:52.413]  Here we go, Jeremiah.
[00:23:57.293 --> 00:24:02.455]  Now this song is about a KGB agent named Andrew Jackson.
[00:24:02.515 --> 00:24:04.675]  He was an enemy of the government.
[00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:05.296]  He was for Al-Qaeda.
[00:24:05.316 --> 00:24:07.356]  Because he fought the government.
[00:24:07.376 --> 00:24:08.036]  But he got his.
[00:24:08.056 --> 00:24:09.117]  Tony Blair defeated him.
[00:24:24.924 --> 00:24:29.027]  We're talking to some of the folks from We Are Change, Anthony and others.
[00:24:29.047 --> 00:24:29.827]  Tell us again, sir,
[00:24:49.056 --> 00:24:53.718]  Tell us your full name, where you are, where you're from, the newest feller we've got on.
[00:24:54.839 --> 00:24:58.581]  They taught me in KGB school how to use those colloquialisms to fool people.
[00:25:01.182 --> 00:25:02.422]  I need to stop screwing around, folks.
[00:25:02.743 --> 00:25:08.685]  You were actually there at Denver, and were you there with us, I think, whenever we took over MSNBC two different nights?
[00:25:09.426 --> 00:25:09.906]  Yes, I was.
[00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:12.027]  You used my microphone for both times.
[00:25:12.438 --> 00:25:13.658]  Your Al-Qaeda phone!
[00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:14.779]  But, but... Yes.
[00:25:14.999 --> 00:25:15.759]  No, I mean, getting serious.
[00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:19.340]  Tell us your full name and, and, and just the record and what you witnessed.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.681]  Um, I'm Jeremiah Van Buren from, um, Toledo, Ohio.
[00:25:22.801 --> 00:25:26.442]  I'm actually from the city where the Marines actually got kicked out of town by a mayor.
[00:25:26.702 --> 00:25:27.423]  Doesn't exist.
[00:25:27.463 --> 00:25:28.043]  Never happened.
[00:25:28.063 --> 00:25:28.803]  Conspiracy theory.
[00:25:30.984 --> 00:25:41.407]  Anyway... Yeah, I'm just, uh, this is my first time, uh, actually working with, um, We Are Change and, um, what I just noticed, um, from, um, here at the RNC from, um, from Denver, I actually noticed
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:50.846]  For the first time in my life, um, um, please actually wearing a gas mask than, um, not in Denver, but actually at the RNC here in St.
[00:25:50.866 --> 00:25:51.147]  Paul.
[00:25:53.368 --> 00:25:59.032]  Would you say, being in Denver as well, that they're much more subdued in Denver versus, uh, there in Minneapolis-St.
[00:25:59.052 --> 00:25:59.272]  Paul?
[00:25:59.973 --> 00:26:00.193]  Yes.
[00:26:02.194 --> 00:26:07.018]  What are some of the other things you've seen from the protectors, the people that protect us from the Bill of Rights?
[00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:21.125]  Um, yeah, basically back in Denver, um, the people that are attacking us back in Denver is mainly, um, the anarchists and some people from MSNBC, but, um, God, here in, um, St.
[00:26:21.165 --> 00:26:28.472]  Paul, it's basically, um, what I've seen so far is basically the police have been, um, provocating incidents out of nowhere.
[00:26:28.512 --> 00:26:34.257]  It's just people have just been protesting and just wandering around the streets just starting actions out of nowhere.
[00:26:35.714 --> 00:26:39.137]  Well, I mean, in America, you can't be allowed to be peaceful out on the street.
[00:26:39.177 --> 00:26:39.898]  I mean, that's evil.
[00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:43.301]  But being serious, what you witnessed is horrible.
[00:26:43.341 --> 00:26:53.431]  Going back to MSNBC attacking us, they broke my megaphone, ripped the strap off, ripped the cord off, ripped the front off, were punching me, punching everybody else, broke one of our...
[00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:55.053]  I remember we all got there, Dad.
[00:26:55.093 --> 00:26:56.954]  Some MSNBC guy actually tried to take out some of our cameras.
[00:27:14.184 --> 00:27:15.365]  Yeah, just basically just
[00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:51.416]  Since you don't know how to be the media, it's basically up to us to be the media, and that's basically how they were just trying to, at times, sabotage us, basically bring us down.
[00:27:51.676 --> 00:27:57.921]  Well that's it, I mean they're calling us radicals for bullhorning live events and shouting at Michelle Malkin.
[00:27:58.221 --> 00:27:59.482]  Our founders did 10,000 times that.
[00:28:01.229 --> 00:28:05.192]  I mean, I mean, we're not burning down ships, setting off dynamite, you know, or black powder.
[00:28:05.652 --> 00:28:08.434]  We're not tar and feathering people, roasting their skin off.
[00:28:08.914 --> 00:28:10.315]  We're not burning down cities.
[00:28:11.376 --> 00:28:15.118]  You know, we're just out shouting, and it's like, oh my God, they're shouting!
[00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:16.579]  Ban them!
[00:28:16.699 --> 00:28:20.022]  But they went to the cops and said, ban them, and the cops said, nope.
[00:28:21.082 --> 00:28:21.843]  So, big difference.
[00:28:21.863 --> 00:28:24.965]  What do you think would have happened in Minnesota if we tried to take over a live TV show?
[00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:30.465]  Um, well, I'm not sure, but we'll be trying to figure out how to do that here in St.
[00:28:30.485 --> 00:28:43.993]  Paul, but, um, well, possibly they could shut us down, possibly just, like, make us go away or something, but possibly to some type of degree, I'm like, they'll just make us just have us arrested or possibly just harass us.
[00:28:44.493 --> 00:28:50.537]  Is there anything else you noticed, uh, that you saw there that you want to make everybody aware of?
[00:28:52.358 --> 00:28:53.899]  Um, God, that,
[00:28:54.463 --> 00:29:02.689]  Ezra, I'm guessing there's more harassment here at the RNC than at the DNC, that Denver Police were actually more polite than the ones here at the RNC.
[00:29:02.829 --> 00:29:08.332]  Yeah, I haven't seen a cop open a door for somebody in years, and they were opening doors for everybody.
[00:29:08.953 --> 00:29:10.314]  They were definitely on good behavior.
[00:29:11.274 --> 00:29:11.654]  They were.
[00:29:12.415 --> 00:29:18.659]  But not, you know, to go to New York or Austin or anywhere else, just kind of like, what are you looking at, slave?
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.981]  What do you want, you piece of trash?
[00:29:21.914 --> 00:29:24.296]  Lick my boots, go over there and clean out my garage!
[00:29:25.097 --> 00:29:28.720]  You exist for one thing, and that is to be my slave!
[00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:31.542]  Alright, hey, good to talk to you guys.
[00:29:31.562 --> 00:29:33.524]  Anybody else from We Are Change wanna get online?
[00:29:33.544 --> 00:29:35.285]  Um, Nick, uh, Sirius.
[00:29:35.665 --> 00:29:35.906]  Nick.
[00:29:35.926 --> 00:29:38.348]  Alright, we'll talk to Nick behind the scenes.
[00:29:38.368 --> 00:29:39.108]  We're skipping this break.
[00:29:39.248 --> 00:29:40.709]  Only at TheInfoWars.com streams.
[00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.012]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:44.032 --> 00:29:48.015]  I gotta get Sirius and take calls from Steve, Jerry, John, and Eddie when we get back.
[00:29:48.836 --> 00:29:49.477]  Uh, but is this Nick?
[00:29:50.441 --> 00:29:51.081]  Yeah, this is Nick.
[00:29:51.262 --> 00:29:53.603]  Nick, announce your criminal name for everyone.
[00:29:54.824 --> 00:29:56.385]  My criminal name's Nick Bakken.
[00:29:57.065 --> 00:29:58.446]  Nick Bakken.
[00:29:58.526 --> 00:29:59.987]  Good to have you on board here, Commander.
[00:30:00.007 --> 00:30:01.188]  Where are you from?
[00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:04.030]  I'm from Minneapolis here.
[00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.312]  Okay, give us a rundown on what you witnessed, Nick.
[00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:11.615]  Well, I witnessed total tyranny in the Twin Cities yesterday.
[00:30:11.635 --> 00:30:15.037]  I felt like I was in East Berlin during the Cold War.
[00:30:15.658 --> 00:30:17.739]  I mean, cops in their eye gear everywhere.
[00:30:19.201 --> 00:30:21.282]  Blocking your path, pushing people around.
[00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:25.503]  Some of it provoked, some of it unprovoked.
[00:30:25.644 --> 00:30:29.005]  We've got Coast Guard people with 50 cattle on their ships.
[00:30:29.245 --> 00:30:31.246]  Boarding peaceful protesters.
[00:30:32.786 --> 00:30:38.689]  We got pictures up at mnchange.org and an article about some of the events that happened yesterday.
[00:30:38.929 --> 00:30:40.209]  And we'll be uploading more today.
[00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:43.551]  Alright, anything else sir?
[00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:45.291]  What's that?
[00:30:45.711 --> 00:30:46.972]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[00:30:48.691 --> 00:30:52.114]  Uh, well, at least my faith isn't shared like Amy Goodman.
[00:30:53.535 --> 00:30:57.518]  Oh yeah, Amy Goodman, but first they beat up two of her reporters to a pulp.
[00:30:58.039 --> 00:31:00.861]  And she walked over and said, we have passes, and they were just like, ahhh!
[00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:04.964]  And now they're charging her with a felony, saying she assaulted them.
[00:31:05.564 --> 00:31:14.912]  Notice how, this is why they're losing all their credibility, is that she's done nothing to them, and it's not just a false arrest, they're going to slap felonies on her, and then make her beat them.
[00:31:17.313 --> 00:31:17.974]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:19.602 --> 00:31:25.489]  But the interesting thing is the tyranny isn't happening just on the outside of the RNC.
[00:31:25.889 --> 00:31:35.721]  We've also talked to many delegates on the internet and we're going to have some exclusive reports on them and change throughout the week with delegates.
[00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:38.495]  The whole thing is teleprompted.
[00:31:38.515 --> 00:31:42.096]  They have to follow with the chosen one.
[00:31:42.277 --> 00:31:43.097]  That's freedom!
[00:31:43.177 --> 00:31:45.198]  You don't have free speech!
[00:31:45.698 --> 00:31:47.379]  That's what the Soviets did!
[00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:49.600]  That's KGB!
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.221]  That's Hitler!
[00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:55.703]  You don't... Camps in black uniforms and secret police is America!
[00:31:56.795 --> 00:32:00.358]  Red, white, blue and apple pie and free speech is Al Qaeda!
[00:32:01.198 --> 00:32:04.400]  My God, young man, do you realize the evil you've been involved in?
[00:32:05.101 --> 00:32:07.282]  Speaking your mind, talking about freedom?
[00:32:08.243 --> 00:32:10.425]  That's what Al Qaeda feeds on, sir.
[00:32:12.046 --> 00:32:12.606]  Okay?
[00:32:12.746 --> 00:32:17.189]  Do you want to repent for talking and using dirty words on air like liberty and freedom?
[00:32:19.051 --> 00:32:19.751]  I know I will not.
[00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:23.980]  Oh my God, are you with us?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.120]  Do you know Bin Laden?
[00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:28.522]  Has Bin Laden... Only Bin Laden talks of the... Ohhhh!
[00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:39.007]  My... But also, the delegates are being harassed by the Secret Service, the good old modern-day Praetorian Guard.
[00:32:39.027 --> 00:32:40.348]  Good, good!
[00:32:40.388 --> 00:32:41.969]  Let's keep those slaves in line!
[00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:50.733]  They're being told that if they do anything against John McCain or anything in support of another candidate, that they'll be kicked out of the delegation.
[00:32:51.343 --> 00:32:52.044]  Well, that's good.
[00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:53.846]  They need to be sent to Siberia.
[00:32:53.906 --> 00:32:54.887]  I mean, Alaska.
[00:32:55.928 --> 00:32:57.169]  KGB training kicking in.
[00:32:57.329 --> 00:32:58.110]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:59.592]  We're coming back live right now.
[00:32:59.632 --> 00:33:00.092]  This is Nick.
[00:33:00.112 --> 00:33:00.472]  Here we go.
[00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:08.561]  This is a song about liberty and freedom.
[00:33:08.581 --> 00:33:09.522]  We can't play that here.
[00:33:09.562 --> 00:33:10.343]  It's un-American.
[00:33:12.853 --> 00:33:15.595]  You can't talk about freedom.
[00:33:15.615 --> 00:33:16.196]  You'll get arrested.
[00:33:16.216 --> 00:33:17.157]  You'll get put on the list.
[00:33:17.177 --> 00:33:19.058]  Nick Boggess is our guest.
[00:33:19.078 --> 00:33:20.259]  I know we got calls.
[00:33:20.439 --> 00:33:21.941]  I'm gonna get to them.
[00:33:37.292 --> 00:33:39.474]  We are discussing the RNC.
[00:33:39.714 --> 00:33:43.537]  Tell us, this is the big news here, Nick, and give us your full name again for the record.
[00:33:43.557 --> 00:33:45.098]  We're back live on the main transmission.
[00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:49.662]  And tell us specifically what the delegates are telling you about how they're completely straitjacketed.
[00:33:50.042 --> 00:33:58.289]  This fits in with, if you go to a quote, chainy public town hall or a bush town hall for seven years, you've got to sign a form swearing to only support him.
[00:33:58.309 --> 00:34:00.191]  Then they advertise it as a public event.
[00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:04.832]  Uh, if you have an anti-war sticker, you're arrested in the parking lot.
[00:34:05.512 --> 00:34:06.573]  This is the new America!
[00:34:07.173 --> 00:34:09.593]  And freedom is evil, tyranny is king.
[00:34:10.334 --> 00:34:13.194]  Uh, but tell us about the delegates there at this staged event.
[00:34:16.455 --> 00:34:16.675]  Nick?
[00:34:18.896 --> 00:34:21.417]  I just had- Okay, looks like we dropped all of our callers.
[00:34:21.837 --> 00:34:23.517]  Oh, the phone company is there.
[00:34:23.537 --> 00:34:29.299]  They're in that big exclusive, uh... Ted has balls of string attached to, uh...
[00:34:30.745 --> 00:34:31.505]  His underbelly?
[00:34:31.585 --> 00:34:32.846]  I'm just joking around.
[00:34:33.686 --> 00:34:39.529]  Hey, call, they were all on Joss's, Yoss's phone, call them back.
[00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:44.492]  You have to on the local number so I can get them here on air.
[00:34:44.512 --> 00:34:50.695]  Well that's what you get Steve and Jerry and John and Eddie and Bob and Will and everybody else that was holding, that's what you get holding on this show.
[00:34:54.697 --> 00:34:56.698]  I shouldn't get in a smart-ass mode because
[00:34:57.802 --> 00:35:00.184]  Because if I do that, I can really get out of control.
[00:35:00.424 --> 00:35:03.547]  It makes me sick how far this country has slid.
[00:35:03.607 --> 00:35:09.672]  Our basic Bill of Rights and Constitution under fundamental attack, being dismantled.
[00:35:10.933 --> 00:35:18.459]  And a bunch of idiots in black uniforms running around pepper spraying people, and the anarchists aren't even starting it.
[00:35:21.702 --> 00:35:24.845]  And then you've got the delegates all straightjacketed, basically.
[00:35:27.912 --> 00:35:29.013]  You know, let's play that audio.
[00:35:29.073 --> 00:35:30.634]  I sent you a bunch of audio clips.
[00:35:30.714 --> 00:35:40.320]  John, I forgot to ask you, do you have the one of McCain the last couple of weeks bumbling around, not knowing the name of his VP, not thinking that Iran is al-Qaeda backed?
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:40.960]  It's ready.
[00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:43.702]  Let's go ahead and play that while we get the phones back up.
[00:35:44.443 --> 00:35:50.727]  And while we get Anthony Yasha and the We Are Change Minnesota people back on, here it is.
[00:35:52.406 --> 00:35:59.790]  Is there anybody that's tired of paying $4 a buck, $4 a gallon for gasoline?
[00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.771]  Is there anybody that's sick and tired of it?
[00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:09.735]  We continue to be concerned about Iranian taking Al-Qaeda into Iran, training them and sending them back.
[00:36:09.875 --> 00:36:20.960]  Well, it's common knowledge and has been reported in the media that Al-Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.101]  That's well known.
[00:36:27.267 --> 00:36:30.148]  I'm sorry, the Iranians are training extremists.
[00:36:31.228 --> 00:36:31.949]  Not Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:32.289 --> 00:36:32.789]  Not Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:32.849 --> 00:36:33.249]  I'm sorry.
[00:36:33.569 --> 00:36:35.210]  You might have had kind of a senior moment there.
[00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:40.712]  To find and connect up a real leader with a real borrower.
[00:36:41.613 --> 00:36:47.975]  The first thing I would do is make sure that we have a missile defense system in place in Czechoslovakia.
[00:36:48.635 --> 00:36:51.917]  And President Putin and
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.261]  Former President Putin.
[00:36:54.401 --> 00:36:56.542]  Former President Putin.
[00:36:56.622 --> 00:37:04.827]  President Putin of Germany gave one of the old Cold War style speeches and that, and that's not change we can believe in.
[00:37:08.029 --> 00:37:12.192]  Tight household budgets are getting tighter.
[00:37:12.938 --> 00:37:14.339]  You shouldn't have used the word timetable.
[00:37:14.379 --> 00:37:14.659]  Pardon me?
[00:37:14.719 --> 00:37:16.200]  You shouldn't have used the word timetable.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.821]  I didn't use the word timetable.
[00:37:18.481 --> 00:37:23.204]  I think it's a pretty good timetable, as we should have horizons for withdrawal.
[00:37:23.224 --> 00:37:29.168]  Oh, well, look, anything is a good timetable that is dictated by conditions on the ground.
[00:37:29.428 --> 00:37:30.369]  Anything is good.
[00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:37.173]  I'm not the youngest candidate in this race.
[00:37:37.333 --> 00:37:37.814]  You know that.
[00:37:38.074 --> 00:37:39.535]  I'm older than Frankenstein.
[00:37:39.615 --> 00:37:40.756]  I've got a few scars.
[00:37:41.517 --> 00:37:43.078]  And I'm older than dirt.
[00:37:43.178 --> 00:37:45.239]  And I've got more scars than Frankenstein.
[00:37:45.279 --> 00:37:46.180]  Screwed up that line.
[00:37:49.162 --> 00:37:49.903]  But I've been around.
[00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:54.973]  We should be able to deliver a bottle of hot water to dehydrated babies.
[00:37:55.473 --> 00:38:05.565]  I don't... That... Look... That... That is... That is so... It's a very hard struggle, particularly given the situation on the Iraq-Pakistan border.
[00:38:06.889 --> 00:38:10.993]  How can we bring pressure to bear on the government of Somalia?
[00:38:11.033 --> 00:38:15.256]  How can we, uh, pardon me, suit in?
[00:38:15.376 --> 00:38:16.417]  I'm sorry, suit in?
[00:38:16.557 --> 00:38:18.339]  I will conduct a respectful debate.
[00:38:18.499 --> 00:38:19.800]  Now, it'll be dispirited.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.801]  It'll be spirited.
[00:38:21.001 --> 00:38:25.645]  I'm a proud, conservative, liberal, republic- conservative, Republican.
[00:38:25.665 --> 00:38:26.806]  Hello.
[00:38:27.327 --> 00:38:27.947]  Easy there.
[00:38:32.091 --> 00:38:34.333]  And that's not change we can believe in.
[00:38:36.474 --> 00:38:40.595]  The oil supplies to the Republic of Czechoslovakia.
[00:38:41.815 --> 00:38:44.456]  Remember, excuse me, the Czech Republic.
[00:38:44.976 --> 00:38:50.937]  I used to call it the Czech Republic, as you know.
[00:38:50.998 --> 00:38:54.118]  To return our property, our party, to the principles.
[00:38:54.938 --> 00:38:59.179]  If you believe you should pay more taxes, I'm the wrong candidate for you.
[00:38:59.539 --> 00:39:00.940]  Senator Obama is your man.
[00:39:04.582 --> 00:39:05.783]  I think he's inside a bubble.
[00:39:05.923 --> 00:39:07.504]  I think he's been ginned up a little bit.
[00:39:07.764 --> 00:39:10.966]  I will veto every single bill.
[00:39:11.106 --> 00:39:19.911]  Senator, can you explain why you and your campaign manager have specifically said that Obama played the race card with his comments the other day?
[00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:28.276]  And can you elaborate when you said that you fought for equal rights for your entire life, what specifically you've done focusing on improving the lives of African Americans?
[00:39:30.017 --> 00:39:31.238]  Alright.
[00:39:31.298 --> 00:39:31.738]  First of all,
[00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:48.983]  The first question, you said, why am I... Well, what it is, when your campaign manager and you reiterated that you backed David... Thank you very much, it's wonderful to be here in Nevada.
[00:39:49.223 --> 00:39:51.366]  Nevada, Nevada, Nevada, Nevada.
[00:39:51.726 --> 00:39:53.368]  It's wonderful to be here in Nevada.
[00:39:53.849 --> 00:39:56.913]  You still view Al-Qaeda in Iraq as a major threat.
[00:39:58.218 --> 00:40:04.621]  It is still a major threat, though it is certainly not as major a threat as it was, say, 15 months ago.
[00:40:04.681 --> 00:40:11.485]  Certainly not an obscure sect of the Shiites or Sunnis or anybody else.
[00:40:12.105 --> 00:40:22.670]  So many other tragic stories of people who are being held, caught hostage by this very cruel and inhumane organization.
[00:40:31.991 --> 00:40:41.673]  For a guy whose official seal carried the motto, yes we can, Senator Obama's agenda sure has a whole lot of no we can't.
[00:40:44.714 --> 00:40:48.194]  Including reduction in oil supplies to Czechoslovakia.
[00:40:48.234 --> 00:40:49.074]  Where are you?
[00:40:49.154 --> 00:40:49.875]  Are you still here?
[00:40:49.895 --> 00:40:50.855]  Or are you not?
[00:40:55.196 --> 00:40:55.296]  Oh!
[00:40:55.836 --> 00:40:56.856]  Mayor Sparks is here!
[00:40:58.067 --> 00:41:00.068]  That's not change we can believe in.
[00:41:01.428 --> 00:41:16.694]  I'd love to see my friend Shaquille O'Neal, who just finished the playoffs last... Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:16.734 --> 00:41:25.417]  John McCain, and there's a lot of other stupid gaffes that he has, but don't worry, he won't be running anything if he's president, neither will Barack Obama.
[00:41:25.457 --> 00:41:25.957]  Remember that.
[00:41:27.421 --> 00:41:37.445]  All these debates about who has more experience, or who has cancer, or who's senile, or who's young, or who has communists in their background, or whose daddy's a Muslim.
[00:41:38.425 --> 00:41:51.050]  None of it amounts to a hill of beans, because since 1947 we've had a complete shadow government, and it's taken full control in 2007, and it's told Congress it runs absolutely nothing, and to sit down and shut up.
[00:41:53.291 --> 00:41:53.671]  Period.
[00:41:54.772 --> 00:41:55.372]  End of story.
[00:41:58.351 --> 00:41:58.951]  End of debate.
[00:42:00.952 --> 00:42:02.572]  The network phone lines are still down.
[00:42:03.113 --> 00:42:09.655]  If the We Are Change folks want to try to call in on our local line, they can, or you can call them, John, if you have a local line.
[00:42:11.015 --> 00:42:19.458]  This happens a few times a year, because things are held together with bailing wire and chewing gum around here.
[00:42:20.298 --> 00:42:21.479]  All right, I'm going to quit screwing around.
[00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:32.108]  I do have a stack of news here I haven't even really gotten to yet, and I really should cover all of this.
[00:42:32.188 --> 00:42:34.350]  I mean, that would really be the best thing for me to do here.
[00:42:35.611 --> 00:42:39.154]  EU dependent on Russian energy balks at Georgia war sanctions.
[00:42:39.714 --> 00:42:40.715]  This is out of Bloomberg.
[00:42:41.355 --> 00:42:46.620]  European Union leaders refuse to impose sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Georgia.
[00:42:48.181 --> 00:42:49.302]  Gotta love that deception.
[00:42:50.183 --> 00:42:53.846]  They refuse to put sanctions on them over them invading Georgia.
[00:42:55.137 --> 00:42:59.299]  When they were being attacked by Georgia and they just moved in and kicked their military out and pulled back.
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:00.820]  Good God!
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:06.143]  Acknowledging their reliance on Russian oil and gas at a time of faltering economic growth.
[00:43:07.803 --> 00:43:18.289]  EU leaders took their symbolic step yesterday of suspending talks over expanding trade ties with Russia, fearing the tougher measures could expose the energy-dependent bloc to Russian retaliation.
[00:43:19.741 --> 00:43:29.910]  Russia is the 27th nation block main supplier of oil and gas and the third biggest trading partner, giving it leverage at a time when the European community threatens to tip into recession.
[00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:34.374]  Europe's determination to maintain business links also undercuts U.S.
[00:43:34.414 --> 00:43:39.218]  efforts to line up allies against the recidivist Russia.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:41.980]  The reassertive Russia.
[00:43:43.922 --> 00:43:44.483]  Oh, man.
[00:43:45.363 --> 00:43:46.945]  Amazing disinformation.
[00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:52.450]  Russia says U.S.
[00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:53.951]  may have sent weapons into Georgia.
[00:43:54.011 --> 00:43:54.992]  Russia suggests U.S.
[00:43:55.032 --> 00:43:59.153]  ships may be carrying weapons to Georgia, along with AIDS, says that's an act of war.
[00:44:00.894 --> 00:44:04.916]  World's largest gold refiner runs out of Krugerrands, also Bloomberg.
[00:44:04.936 --> 00:44:08.438]  This is running out of gold here.
[00:44:09.618 --> 00:44:13.660]  But gold's kind of gone up a little bit, overall fallen.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.502]  Everybody's buying it off the shelves, but you don't want any of it.
[00:44:17.962 --> 00:44:20.203]  The dollar's strong, man, everything's great.
[00:44:21.206 --> 00:44:21.966]  Print more money!
[00:44:23.587 --> 00:44:26.067]  The Georgian crisis turns dangerous.
[00:44:26.207 --> 00:44:27.607]  Lew Rockwell really says it well.
[00:44:28.948 --> 00:44:35.669]  Pipsqueak Georgia's harebrained and disastrous attack on tiny South City has produced a full-blown crisis, pitting the U.S.
[00:44:35.709 --> 00:44:37.150]  and NATO against the bear.
[00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:40.470]  In an act fraught with danger, U.S.
[00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:43.171]  and NATO warships are delivering supplies to Georgia.
[00:44:44.167 --> 00:44:45.608]  Watched by Russian men of war.
[00:44:46.308 --> 00:44:46.729]  The U.S.
[00:44:46.769 --> 00:44:53.273]  Congress may soon vote... That's a man of war is a ship, for those public school educated that drink fluoride like myself.
[00:44:54.214 --> 00:44:54.774]  The U.S.
[00:44:55.294 --> 00:45:00.778]  Congress may soon vote one billion for Americans' embattled Georgia satellite.
[00:45:01.957 --> 00:45:05.299]  The Western powers have resorted to fierce Cold War rhetoric.
[00:45:05.659 --> 00:45:06.719]  They're playing with fire.
[00:45:06.759 --> 00:45:11.162]  Russia has some 6,600 strategic nuclear weapons, mostly aimed at North America and Europe.
[00:45:11.322 --> 00:45:21.287]  Besides, the U.S., which invaded Afghanistan and Iraq and whose air force just killed 90 Afghan civilians, 60 of them children, is in no position to lecture Moscow about aggression.
[00:45:22.888 --> 00:45:28.811]  France's conservative president, Nicolas Sarkozy, blasted Russia and will shortly hold a European summit over Georgia and Brussels.
[00:45:29.838 --> 00:45:33.539]  As usual, the Harper government faithfully echoed Washington's words.
[00:45:33.939 --> 00:45:35.700]  Poland agreed to replace a U.S.
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:41.522]  anti-ballistic missile system only 184 kilometers from Russian border, provoking Moscow's fury.
[00:45:41.882 --> 00:45:45.123]  Ukraine and Poland are loudly backing Georgia.
[00:45:46.468 --> 00:46:01.327]  Russia's Chief of Staff, Yuri Bolovensky, warns his nation has the right to launch a preemptive nuclear strike, that's a quote, against enemies in line, he tartly noted, with Bush administration's own policy of preemption.
[00:46:03.257 --> 00:46:06.518]  Topping off this war of words, two of U.S.
[00:46:06.578 --> 00:46:14.201]  Senator John McCain's closest right-wing allies, Senators Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham, went to Georgia and called for tough measures against Moscow.
[00:46:14.542 --> 00:46:25.646]  They urged isolating Russia for aggression and admitted Ukraine and Georgia to McCain's allies list in NATO.
[00:46:26.767 --> 00:46:27.367]  And it goes on.
[00:46:29.488 --> 00:46:34.311]  Russian bombers again cloud skies in Europe's far north.
[00:46:35.332 --> 00:46:36.993]  That's out of space war today.
[00:46:37.013 --> 00:46:46.459]  In scenes reminiscent of the Cold War, Russian bombers have returned to the skies of Europe's far north after years of absence, putting NATO's jet fighters on alert once again.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:54.825]  And Chinese subs are popping up behind the aircraft carriers while the fluoride heads stumble around drooling on the deck, literally.
[00:46:56.466 --> 00:46:57.107]  Blackwater
[00:46:58.373 --> 00:47:03.857]  Preps for and involved in Hurricane Gustav Gaddafi to hand out oil money.
[00:47:03.877 --> 00:47:07.019]  He says he's going to give most of the oil profits just to the general public.
[00:47:07.039 --> 00:47:08.480]  That's got Wall Street spinning.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:15.285]  Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has said oil profits should be given directly to citizens as part of the sweeping economic and political reforms.
[00:47:16.325 --> 00:47:23.290]  Speaking during celebrations to mark 39 years in power in Libya's second city, Colonel Gaddafi
[00:47:24.787 --> 00:47:27.229]  Extol the virtues of privatization.
[00:47:27.269 --> 00:47:31.792]  The Libyan leader said society would reformulate itself in a new free and diplomatic way.
[00:47:36.175 --> 00:47:41.938]  Police, state, RNC, a nun and eight others swept into unmarked van by cops in Minnesota.
[00:47:42.439 --> 00:47:44.060]  That's all a snatch and grab drill.
[00:47:45.746 --> 00:47:50.210]  283 arrested in Monday's RNC protest in St.
[00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:50.610]  Paul.
[00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:58.076]  You know, we already reported a bunch of mainline reporters beaten to a pulp all on video by cops on power trips.
[00:47:59.337 --> 00:48:02.760]  Palin rebuts rumors says daughter pregnant, not her.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.841]  Who cares?
[00:48:05.222 --> 00:48:08.765]  Police fire tear gas in the protest group.
[00:48:11.525 --> 00:48:15.491]  Obama event suspends Second Amendment rights, UPI.
[00:48:15.991 --> 00:48:21.479]  The arrest of a gun-carrying man near Pennsylvania event, a Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, was unfair, a gun rights group alleges.
[00:48:21.959 --> 00:48:27.527]  Members of OpenCarry.org contend that arrest of John Noble, 50, of Industry
[00:48:28.248 --> 00:48:29.189]  Was uncalled for.
[00:48:29.669 --> 00:48:37.737]  Alleging state police suspended a state law allowing the right to bear arms ahead of the scheduled presence of Illinois Senator at a nearby site.
[00:48:38.177 --> 00:48:40.039]  The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported today.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:47.326]  Noble was arrested Friday in Beaver County, near where Obama was to appear, after police found him carrying a loaded semi-automatic handgun.
[00:48:48.067 --> 00:48:48.928]  No threat to anyone.
[00:48:49.548 --> 00:48:53.051]  The 6-foot-3, 380-pound gun owner... Oh, see, he's big.
[00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:55.310]  He's evil.
[00:48:55.850 --> 00:49:00.773]  Told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Mr. Obama doesn't trump my constitutional rights.
[00:49:00.873 --> 00:49:02.073]  Oh yes he does, Bubba.
[00:49:02.633 --> 00:49:05.234]  Congress has been told to get down and lick boots.
[00:49:05.835 --> 00:49:08.156]  The President of the United States doesn't trump my constitutional rights.
[00:49:08.736 --> 00:49:14.779]  Noble, who was handcuffed and questioned for about two hours, was told by state police he would receive two citations by mail for disorderly conduct.
[00:49:15.799 --> 00:49:17.240]  You're lucky that he didn't kill you, pal.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.580]  And say you hit him.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.382]  Noble said he was only intending to hand out flyers about gun rights.
[00:49:23.854 --> 00:49:25.575]  And then they went and found the gun in his car.
[00:49:25.636 --> 00:49:26.396]  You don't do that.
[00:49:27.117 --> 00:49:29.219]  I had a Bible in one hand and an apple in the other.
[00:49:29.999 --> 00:49:32.661]  I was going to pass out flyers but never got the chance.
[00:49:33.162 --> 00:49:34.723]  Well, you don't do that in America, boy.
[00:49:34.743 --> 00:49:38.066]  Gotta learn how to be a slave, punk.
[00:49:40.928 --> 00:49:42.530]  Call her General Palin.
[00:49:44.595 --> 00:49:50.861]  New reports by the McCain campaign are saying that she's really a general, because she commanded the National Guard in Alaska.
[00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:52.682]  These people, the public will believe it.
[00:49:52.762 --> 00:49:56.386]  I mean, you know, you tell them cyanide's mother's milk, they'll gobble it down.
[00:49:56.806 --> 00:50:01.570]  Watch people die, and you can still tell them, nope, it's the law, and they'll go, okay, just fall over dead.
[00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:02.631]  You know, I love the government.
[00:50:03.772 --> 00:50:05.393]  Oh, you say a gun to my head's good?
[00:50:05.453 --> 00:50:06.634]  Bam, bam, oh, I love it!
[00:50:07.515 --> 00:50:08.756]  You know, I mean, they just believe anything.
[00:50:09.056 --> 00:50:09.996]  Jump off that cliff!
[00:50:10.377 --> 00:50:11.697]  It's what you do if you love America!
[00:50:11.817 --> 00:50:12.738]  Oh, okay!
[00:50:13.458 --> 00:50:14.579]  We're banning the Bill of Rights!
[00:50:14.819 --> 00:50:15.759]  It's pro-America!
[00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:17.760]  If you're for the Bill of Rights, you're KGB!
[00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:18.341]  Okay!
[00:50:18.821 --> 00:50:20.322]  I hate America!
[00:50:27.866 --> 00:50:31.688]  John's up there in Minnesota in the broom closet, trying to get things working.
[00:50:33.967 --> 00:50:35.768]  Sounds like we're not going to take any more calls today.
[00:50:36.409 --> 00:50:37.409]  But hey, C'est La Vie!
[00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:41.132]  I've got so much news to cover, I'm going to skip this break too.
[00:50:41.332 --> 00:50:44.935]  Only for InfoWars.com, Streamlisters, and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:50:44.995 --> 00:50:45.976]  Stay with me.
[00:50:56.764 --> 00:50:59.787]  I'm strong to the finish, because I drink my coffee.
[00:51:01.016 --> 00:51:04.239]  I'm Alex the Coffee Man, which is also KGB.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.604]  Everyone knows it's people that drink coffee during the afternoon of KGB.
[00:51:11.205 --> 00:51:14.788]  He's also been seen drinking screwdrivers with vodka.
[00:51:14.808 --> 00:51:19.412]  There's clear evidence that he is working for Vladimir Putin.
[00:51:21.539 --> 00:51:24.500]  You will learn to not hate America.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:31.061]  You will learn to say that Russia attacked United States peach farms in southern Georgia.
[00:51:32.021 --> 00:51:33.581]  Yes, yes, actually, you're right.
[00:51:33.601 --> 00:51:37.382]  I'm hearing the voices of the KGB.
[00:51:38.262 --> 00:51:39.342]  I'm going to quit screwing around.
[00:51:39.722 --> 00:51:41.362]  People will have fun without editing it together.
[00:51:43.903 --> 00:51:47.483]  Dutch Intel, US to strike Iran in coming weeks.
[00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:50.104]  I'm going to cover that when we come back to the main audience.
[00:51:52.199 --> 00:51:57.403]  Members of fringe Alaskan Independence Party say Palin was a member in the 90s.
[00:51:59.544 --> 00:52:00.045]  That was true.
[00:52:00.065 --> 00:52:01.246]  That would be a plus for her.
[00:52:01.906 --> 00:52:05.789]  US, Europe, Japan mold dollar support rescue program.
[00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:09.492]  Europe, Japan mold dollar rescue report.
[00:52:09.532 --> 00:52:10.472]  That's AP.
[00:52:10.552 --> 00:52:12.214]  The other one was CNBC.
[00:52:14.136 --> 00:52:17.397]  Silent protests light up Mexico in anti-crime marches.
[00:52:17.797 --> 00:52:19.237]  I want to cover that, too, when I get back.
[00:52:19.777 --> 00:52:20.497]  Here's the report.
[00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:25.278]  The first time in over 200 years that the sun has been spotless, because they've had telescopes for more than 300.
[00:52:26.438 --> 00:52:31.780]  Going back to Galileo, seeing, you know, the trenches on Mars and thinking they were canals.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.300]  Galileo or Copernicus?
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:35.800]  I don't know.
[00:52:37.161 --> 00:52:37.981]  It was Galileo.
[00:52:39.221 --> 00:52:43.702]  But here it is, and now they're saying, Ice Age, Ice Age.
[00:52:48.206 --> 00:52:49.527]  Maybe I'll go into overdrive today.
[00:52:49.548 --> 00:52:51.790]  I've got so much news I haven't covered yet.
[00:52:53.352 --> 00:53:06.726]  Vaccine-induced inflammation linked to epidemic of type 2 diabetes and metabolic problems, especially in ethnic groups, people of color.
[00:53:07.167 --> 00:53:08.869]  That's Reuters right there.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.621]  But hell, don't listen to me, you know.
[00:53:11.702 --> 00:53:13.223]  Just go take more shots.
[00:53:13.563 --> 00:53:15.525]  Die of brain tumors when you're 14.
[00:53:15.925 --> 00:53:16.786]  Shoot your kids up.
[00:53:16.806 --> 00:53:17.867]  Get diabetes.
[00:53:18.627 --> 00:53:19.688]  You know, just let it kill you.
[00:53:19.708 --> 00:53:20.509]  I mean, don't listen to me.
[00:53:20.989 --> 00:53:23.752]  Hepatitis B vaccine linked to onset of diabetes.
[00:53:24.512 --> 00:53:25.293]  Health News.
[00:53:25.433 --> 00:53:26.194]  WebMD.
[00:53:26.934 --> 00:53:27.915]  That's from WebMD.
[00:53:28.796 --> 00:53:29.076]  You know.
[00:53:29.957 --> 00:53:31.538]  But you know, I'm a KGB agent.
[00:53:31.558 --> 00:53:32.820]  I probably made that up too.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.101]  Just take more shots.
[00:53:34.181 --> 00:53:35.162]  Eat GMO food.
[00:53:35.842 --> 00:53:36.623]  Everything's fine.
[00:53:40.402 --> 00:53:43.085]  The meningitis vaccine linked to diabetes increases.
[00:53:43.105 --> 00:53:44.267]  That's from 1999.
[00:53:44.307 --> 00:53:46.349]  The British Medical Journal.
[00:53:46.409 --> 00:53:47.150]  Oh my God.
[00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.831]  Don't listen to them.
[00:53:47.871 --> 00:53:48.852]  They're KGB too.
[00:53:51.696 --> 00:53:55.320]  I got a bunch of global government climate tax news.
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.641]  Let's go back live to everybody.
[00:53:56.661 --> 00:53:56.922]  Here we go.
[00:54:03.891 --> 00:54:09.173]  If you type in the words, vaccine diabetes, you will get thousands of medical journal reports.
[00:54:09.773 --> 00:54:22.416]  Here's one out of the British Medical Journal, 1999, that the meningitis vaccine linked to diabetes increase, and there's just thousands of studies.
[00:54:23.097 --> 00:54:24.037]  I mean, it's like
[00:54:24.974 --> 00:54:28.417]  You know, you shoot yourself in the head with a .50 caliber rifle, you're probably going to die.
[00:54:28.457 --> 00:54:30.739]  You take vaccines, you're going to get diabetes.
[00:54:30.759 --> 00:54:33.522]  You drink stuff out of aluminum cans, you're going to get Alzheimer's.
[00:54:34.362 --> 00:54:35.123]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:54:36.224 --> 00:54:37.225]  But hey, don't listen to me.
[00:54:37.305 --> 00:54:38.766]  Just go ahead and kill yourselves, you know.
[00:54:39.487 --> 00:54:45.452]  It's too important to deny the reality and actually save you and your children, so just throw something at the radio right now.
[00:54:45.512 --> 00:54:46.133]  It'll turn it off.
[00:54:46.997 --> 00:54:49.159]  I'm only telling you the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth.
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.803]  Probably easier just to giggle and laugh and call me a KGB agent.
[00:54:53.804 --> 00:54:56.587]  Hepatitis B vaccine linked to onset of diabetes.
[00:54:57.628 --> 00:54:59.530]  That's out of WebMD, that's the new one.
[00:55:00.111 --> 00:55:01.072]  Go ahead, give it to your baby.
[00:55:01.672 --> 00:55:03.694]  You know, it'll be a horrible, painful death, you know.
[00:55:04.675 --> 00:55:05.997]  Decade later, 20 years later.
[00:55:07.335 --> 00:55:09.196]  Meningitis vaccine linked to diabetes.
[00:55:09.236 --> 00:55:09.856]  I mean, just on and on.
[00:55:09.876 --> 00:55:10.496]  Here's Reuters.
[00:55:10.536 --> 00:55:14.458]  Vaccine-induced inflammation linked to epidemic of type 2 diabetes.
[00:55:14.478 --> 00:55:16.779]  But hell, man, just don't listen to us!
[00:55:17.979 --> 00:55:20.180]  Let the government tell you it's the law you've got to take all these.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.100]  I mean, that's a lie.
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:25.062]  That should freak you out that they're lying about something that big, that it's the law you've got to take it.
[00:55:25.562 --> 00:55:26.782]  Believe a pack of liars.
[00:55:26.822 --> 00:55:27.863]  Take what they say give you.
[00:55:30.822 --> 00:55:32.503]  Don't go to Infowars.com.
[00:55:32.523 --> 00:55:36.724]  Don't get the new film, Fabled Enemies, I just produced, that Jason Berman has directed.
[00:55:36.764 --> 00:55:39.945]  An incredible, shocking, controversial 9-11 film.
[00:55:39.965 --> 00:55:42.926]  Don't watch it right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:55:42.946 --> 00:55:44.867]  Don't burn copies to disk and give it to people.
[00:55:45.327 --> 00:55:49.409]  Just take vaccines, drink fluoride, eat GMO food, and enjoy dying!
[00:55:49.729 --> 00:55:50.749]  Drink fluoride!
[00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:57.251]  Dutch Intel says you asked to strike Iran in coming weeks, Jerusalem Post.
[00:55:57.492 --> 00:55:57.892]  So what?
[00:55:57.932 --> 00:55:58.452]  That's freedom.
[00:56:00.279 --> 00:56:04.981]  Over here, silent protesters light up Mexico in anti-crime marches.
[00:56:06.542 --> 00:56:12.585]  More than 200,000 white-clad protesters have joined the largest wave of nationwide protest in Mexico City alone.
[00:56:13.445 --> 00:56:17.888]  Hundreds of drug-related murders a week, kidnappings, the whole society's imploding.
[00:56:18.768 --> 00:56:20.589]  Will the government decriminalize drugs?
[00:56:20.849 --> 00:56:21.649]  Hell no!
[00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:25.311]  The minute they did, all this would end.
[00:56:28.273 --> 00:56:28.753]  That's why they
[00:56:31.434 --> 00:56:35.858]  Funded prohibition, the liquor companies did, because they knew they'd ship it in and make a hundred times.
[00:56:36.258 --> 00:56:37.319]  Alcoholism tripled.
[00:56:37.719 --> 00:56:38.800]  People want what's illegal.
[00:56:39.541 --> 00:56:42.123]  Heroin, cocaine is all shipped in, certified.
[00:56:42.163 --> 00:56:45.346]  Anybody that they bust is who isn't certified or who's low-level.
[00:56:45.366 --> 00:56:46.607]  They've been caught millions of times.
[00:56:46.667 --> 00:56:47.208]  I mean millions.
[00:56:47.948 --> 00:56:50.410]  They have been caught over and over and over and over again.
[00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:54.914]  The banks, every day, thousands of transactions that are known drug transactions from out of the country.
[00:56:54.934 --> 00:56:55.535]  That's legal.
[00:56:56.916 --> 00:56:58.878]  The world is run by the mafia.
[00:56:59.713 --> 00:57:04.995]  And as soon as you figure that out... By the way, it's come out that trichinosis is spreading.
[00:57:05.035 --> 00:57:06.636]  It's killing a bunch of people in Austin.
[00:57:06.716 --> 00:57:09.077]  It's from the illegal aliens in food preparation.
[00:57:09.477 --> 00:57:13.479]  The illegal aliens are defecating all over the produce when it's shipped in.
[00:57:14.459 --> 00:57:15.780]  I told you that a year ago.
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.540]  Now it's admitted that's where it came from.
[00:57:17.861 --> 00:57:18.581]  It ain't gonna stop.
[00:57:19.301 --> 00:57:20.602]  It ain't gonna stop for a minute.
[00:57:20.622 --> 00:57:21.662]  Am I against illegal aliens?
[00:57:21.722 --> 00:57:21.922]  No.
[00:57:22.743 --> 00:57:25.504]  Do I want them with trichinosis making my food?
[00:57:25.524 --> 00:57:25.564]  No.
[00:57:27.506 --> 00:57:30.548]  Doesn't matter, it's going to intensify, so just enjoy the trichinosis.
[00:57:31.389 --> 00:57:32.990]  And enjoy the hepatitis.
[00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:35.972]  And enjoy the leprosy now spreading.
[00:57:35.992 --> 00:57:39.014]  And just enjoy the drug-resistant TB.
[00:57:40.415 --> 00:57:44.918]  And enjoy the Mexican drug gangs, government-backed, murdering whoever they want in the town I live in.
[00:57:45.258 --> 00:57:49.602]  Enjoy the rocket attacks, the truck bombs that are covered up, the murders, the kidnappings.
[00:57:49.862 --> 00:57:51.323]  We get to be like they are in Mexico.
[00:57:51.563 --> 00:57:54.265]  Total peon slaves, pushed around.
[00:57:57.458 --> 00:57:58.179]  I'm out of time.
[00:57:58.259 --> 00:58:00.260]  Amazing first hour, second hour, third hour.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.661]  You just heard the wild fourth hour.
[00:58:01.681 --> 00:58:10.348]  If you missed any of it, it retransmits now at the one and only InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:10.388 --> 00:58:16.693]  And I covered a whole pastel of news in the first hour on the protest, what's happening.
[00:58:18.392 --> 00:58:20.693]  Uh, on the police state, on the economy, on Russia.
[00:58:20.713 --> 00:58:21.673]  So, I'll be right back.
[00:58:22.194 --> 00:58:23.454]  Gotta go to one place, InfoWars.com.
[00:58:23.474 --> 00:58:27.576]  For everybody else on the MNFM dial, back live tomorrow, or 9 to midnight this evening.
[00:58:27.596 --> 00:58:28.996]  Don't forget, Fabled Enemies is out.
