[00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:08.011]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:09.773]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.773 --> 00:00:11.354]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:12.275]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:17.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.806]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.229]  All right, we've only got him for about 15 minutes.
[00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:25.849]  Very busy.
[00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:31.579]  And so we're going to come in hot here directly to our first guest of the day.
[00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.541]  I'll tell you about the other guests the news will be covering after he leaves us in about 16 minutes.
[00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:38.142]  He is Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:50.620]  Here to talk about the economic implosion, the depression that's developing on Main Street as the banks worldwide are setting up a world monetary system.
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.167]  Congressman, thank you for joining us on this 17th day of October.
[00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:58.468]  Nice to be with you again.
[00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:00.070]  You've got the floor, sir.
[00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.011]  You're the expert on this.
[00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:02.052]  What are we facing right now?
[00:01:02.692 --> 00:01:08.715]  Well, it looks like it's all downhill from now on, because what Washington's doing is exactly wrong.
[00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:15.879]  They're supposed to allow adjustments to come once they realize they've messed up the economy, but instead they're just doing more of the same.
[00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:19.441]  I saw an article this morning that tells you how desperate they are.
[00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:25.504]  It was on Reuters, and a lot of this stuff is getting in the main street now, and talking about how bad these things are.
[00:01:26.084 --> 00:01:34.331]  This story said that the amount that we'll inject here will have promises over $5 trillion.
[00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:40.736]  And I was on CNN this morning and I told them, I said, you know, if that could solve the problem, I said, we would never have to work again.
[00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:42.017]  Just print money.
[00:01:42.017 --> 00:01:43.959]  But obviously it doesn't solve the problem.
[00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:52.226]  And, you know, even if it temporarily helps the market or calms the markets or increases the value of the dollar, it's all temporary because
[00:01:52.706 --> 00:01:55.569]  Everything we've done for decades has been inflationary.
[00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:03.576]  Now, this is just excessive inflation of the money supply, and this is going to be harmful to us.
[00:02:03.576 --> 00:02:07.459]  We need to go back to work again, and that's the part that people don't like.
[00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:13.444]  They think that the government can take care of us from cradle to grave, and that we never have to worry.
[00:02:13.444 --> 00:02:16.627]  They always say, government's going to take care of us, but they never ask who's taking care of us.
[00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:27.708]  There's a contest going on between us who believe in freedom and hard work and savings and all, and those who think that there is a free lunch.
[00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:38.310]  But I think we're in transition now because our numbers are growing, because the people who have for so long believed the government could take care of them are starting to realize they can't trust the government.
[00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.651]  So to me, it's a bit of an opportunity for us to present our case, but it's going to be a tough struggle.
[00:02:42.751 --> 00:03:04.539]  Well, you've always talked about when the crisis of the Central Banking Fractional Reserve System came to a head, and you predicted in Bastrop, Texas four years ago that it would happen by 2007-2008, you were right, that there would be a contest between those that want an all-powerful, omnipresent, Soviet-style state, claiming that's the solution, more of what they brought us, versus true free market.
[00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:11.842]  And I see the media, a lot of the media trying to claim capitalism, or free market did this, when that's not what it is, is it, Congressman?
[00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:16.745]  And that's probably the most detrimental thought that's floating around out there.
[00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:18.446]  But that's what happened in the Depression.
[00:03:18.446 --> 00:03:29.434]  That was the first initial surge toward socialism, was they blamed the collapse of the stock market in 1929 and the Depression on capitalism and the gold standard.
[00:03:29.434 --> 00:03:32.496]  So that's when we embarked on welfareism.
[00:03:32.496 --> 00:03:34.397]  Now the same thing is happening again.
[00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:38.600]  And even, you know, when you hear the President, he keeps saying, well, I'm a free market person.
[00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:44.968]  Free markets sometimes get into trouble and we have to bail them out, we have to help them.
[00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:55.802]  But whoever, I keep asking, where did this notion come from that freedom gets into trouble and you save freedom with socialism and dictatorial powers?
[00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:57.705]  I don't know why the American people buy into that.
[00:03:57.765 --> 00:03:59.026]  We're good to go.
[00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:23.622]  Thinking that they can do a better job than government.
[00:04:23.622 --> 00:04:35.134]  And yeah, we too often as a people accept this idea that there is a free lunch, but things are changing and yet the opposition are laying their plans as well.
[00:04:35.134 --> 00:04:40.160]  That's why I fear the fact that they might come up with this idea of a one single world central bank.
[00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:44.496]  Well, that's exactly what they're now proposing.
[00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:52.638]  For decades, we've warned people that when this monetary crisis came from their fraudulent crony system that this would happen, and that is now being proposed.
[00:04:52.638 --> 00:04:58.100]  I have scores of mainstream articles in the last week where they're calling for globalization, standardization of currencies.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.561]  We'll be right back with Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:07.998]  Take a stand for health.

[00:05:17.908 --> 00:05:19.269]  Flush out toxins.
[00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:21.091]  Lower blood sugar levels.
[00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:23.233]  Annihilate acid reflux.
[00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:23.994]  Lose weight!
[00:05:24.654 --> 00:05:26.134]  You can do it!

[00:05:29.135 --> 00:05:30.215]  Grab life.
[00:05:30.215 --> 00:05:31.336]  Turn from death.
[00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:34.196]  The chemicals in the air will only get worse.

[00:06:00.807 --> 00:06:06.533]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.874]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:07.874 --> 00:06:09.856]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:16.222]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:25.788]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:25.788 --> 00:06:32.873]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:32.873 --> 00:06:35.935]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:35.935 --> 00:06:41.079]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:44.902]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:07:00.636 --> 00:07:02.778]  High gasoline prices got you down.
[00:07:02.778 --> 00:07:04.800]  Is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to?
[00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:11.372]  Poor quality gasoline and the addition of ethanol plugs your fuel injectors and slowly robs fuel economy.

[00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:06.095]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.095 --> 00:08:09.976]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:09.976 --> 00:08:14.178]  Alright, Ron Paul is our guest for about seven, eight more minutes here today.
[00:08:14.178 --> 00:08:15.599]  I appreciate him joining us.
[00:08:17.802 --> 00:08:23.068]  Congressman, in the last segment we were talking about calls for a new global financial order.
[00:08:23.068 --> 00:08:24.870]  You said they would do that about a month ago.
[00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.493]  They have called for that.
[00:08:27.493 --> 00:08:32.218]  In the scores of publications, here's a headline, calls for new global financial order increase.
[00:08:32.218 --> 00:08:35.943]  We'll all still have our currency by name, but a private group of bankers
[00:08:36.503 --> 00:08:40.008]  Yeah, there's no doubt about it, and they're doing it through the financial system.
[00:08:54.546 --> 00:09:02.671]  We call it socialism, and it is a form of socialism, but it's closer to fascism, you know, because big business and big government are our partners in this deal.
[00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:06.273]  So it's a little bit different than the communism and Swedish socialism.
[00:09:07.173 --> 00:09:13.335]  But I think that this has been going on, as you I'm sure agree, it's been going on for a long time.
[00:09:13.335 --> 00:09:22.837]  But I think what's really happening today is that we're at the end stages of the monetary system that evolved out of the breakdown of Bretton Woods in 1971.
[00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:26.758]  And it's lasted an amazingly long period of time, 37 years.
[00:09:26.758 --> 00:09:31.560]  That's pretty good for a total fiat currency, but it has to be revamped.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:39.302]  They're talking about liquidity crises and tight credit here in this country and around the world.
[00:09:39.302 --> 00:09:49.145]  But what they're not saying is that the dollar reserve standard is done for, and they're just lining up now to see who the most powerful special interests are.
[00:09:49.145 --> 00:09:57.488]  Even though we talk about the special interests and the powerful influential people, but I'm sure there's a contest going on there.
[00:09:57.488 --> 00:10:01.969]  Some win and some lose, and there are contests between these groups.
[00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:07.013]  But they're lining them up, and the central banks have talked for a long time to each other.
[00:10:07.013 --> 00:10:16.400]  This is why I'm going to work harder next year, although I've had this before, is even though we can't get rid of the Fed in a day, we need to have more transparency.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.582]  We need an audit of the Fed.
[00:10:18.582 --> 00:10:26.608]  And the one top secret thing that they have at the Fed are the conversations they have with other central bankers of the world.
[00:10:26.608 --> 00:10:27.769]  If we knew everything
[00:10:28.209 --> 00:10:29.671]  The Fed was doing insane.
[00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:33.995]  Everything that President's Working Group on Financial Markets was doing insane.
[00:10:33.995 --> 00:10:42.443]  We'd have a lot better insight because I am sure they have been very much involved in the markets and they're losing control of it and that's why they have to start a whole new system.
[00:10:42.443 --> 00:10:44.224]  Well that was my next question.
[00:10:44.224 --> 00:10:47.948]  This week even MSNBC's reported secret meetings with Paulson.
[00:10:48.548 --> 00:11:01.321]  And the top ten banking heads, where they're handing them hundreds of billions of dollars apiece, including money the brokerage firm Goldman Sachs, with an inner group of Goldman Sachs, Kashkari, and of course Paulson running it.
[00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:05.445]  I mean, that's beyond conflict of interest and insider trading.
[00:11:05.445 --> 00:11:08.708]  I mean, should Congress call for a public investigation of that?
[00:11:09.048 --> 00:11:10.510]  Well, absolutely.
[00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:19.240]  And, you know, you would think that the opposition party, if that's what you call it, the Democrats, when the Republicans have the presidency, that they would do that.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.764]  But, you know, when it comes to a bailout, where is Pelosi?
[00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:24.847]  When it comes to funding the war, where is Pelosi and her people?
[00:11:24.847 --> 00:11:26.429]  They're all very supportive of it.
[00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:34.017]  Whether it's working your way into the system and being Secretary-Treasurer for Republican or Democrat, it's the same.
[00:11:34.017 --> 00:11:39.162]  If you're the Speaker of the House, whether you're Republican or Democrat, you still have to be on the inside.
[00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:42.226]  So there's really not much of a chance for oversight.
[00:11:42.226 --> 00:11:47.431]  All we can do is demand it, alert the people, and try to let the people know exactly what's going on.
[00:11:47.631 --> 00:12:09.633]  Congressman, isn't the good news, though, they were getting thousand to one phone calls, according to many congressmen and the press, and senators, against the Banker Takeover Empowerment Immunity Bill, as it should properly be called, and so we can say the American people don't know what's going on, but really, they are waking up to this, and it's showing how you have both parties working for the international banking system and not for the people.
[00:12:09.913 --> 00:12:11.134]  You know, it's very encouraging.
[00:12:11.134 --> 00:12:12.335]  We won that first vote.
[00:12:12.335 --> 00:12:13.195]  The people spoke out.
[00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:14.316]  They knew what was going on.
[00:12:14.316 --> 00:12:17.598]  Then the next step was the special interests came in.
[00:12:17.598 --> 00:12:18.318]  They had the money.
[00:12:18.318 --> 00:12:19.899]  They twisted the arm and they badgered.
[00:12:19.899 --> 00:12:24.662]  And we had 57 individuals switch their votes.
[00:12:24.662 --> 00:12:30.226]  But the next step should be, if the people really wake up, is throw the rascals out.
[00:12:30.806 --> 00:12:43.618]  Especially if you take 57 of those guys and switch votes, if there was ever a group that should be targeted, they should all lose their elections just for switching their votes and not even defending what they're doing.
[00:12:43.618 --> 00:12:51.245]  It's a tough job to win these elections, but hopefully we see a lot of incumbent lose, both Republicans and Democrats.
[00:12:51.665 --> 00:13:16.017]  Congressman Ron Paul, briefly, studying history, being a monetary researcher yourself, an award-winning researcher in this, what will this hyperinflation, most experts saying 25-30% compounded by next year, we're about 14% now, people on fixed incomes, a real depression in the economy with hyperinflation on top of it, really never before seen since Weimar, what is that going to look like on the street?
[00:13:16.983 --> 00:13:24.446]  Well, it's going to be pretty rough, and that's why people say that the inner cities could be really in turmoil by that time.
[00:13:24.446 --> 00:13:41.113]  But it's also the reason our government has probably made these preparations, you know, with military troops and preparing for emergencies and all the ability to undermine every bit of privacy in this country.
[00:13:41.113 --> 00:13:44.015]  I imagine they know what they're up against.
[00:13:44.855 --> 00:13:49.197]  It could be very, very bad, but if we did the right things, it wouldn't have to be bad.
[00:13:49.197 --> 00:14:04.023]  That's why I think our efforts are frustrating at times, but what else can we do other than alert as many people, get as many people prepared, the more people who can take care of themselves and be self-sustainable, the better.
[00:14:04.023 --> 00:14:09.906]  But ultimately, we have to win the intellectual fight and convince people that freedom is better than socialism.
[00:14:09.906 --> 00:14:13.768]  All right, Congressman, two final questions.
[00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:24.049]  Congressman Brad Sherman came on this show last week and said that they were threatened with physical, now Glenn Beck's covered it, martial law.
[00:14:24.049 --> 00:14:26.991]  They said martial law will just be declared if Congress doesn't pass this.
[00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:32.032]  He said he couldn't talk about because of rules of the House, the different congressmen that told him that.
[00:14:32.032 --> 00:14:37.314]  A, can you comment on that and the Army talking about using troops through NORTHCOM against the American people?
[00:14:37.314 --> 00:14:41.196]  And B, did you hear about these threats?
[00:14:41.876 --> 00:14:44.398]  I didn't hear about them, so I can't verify them.
[00:14:44.398 --> 00:14:46.339]  I'm not totally surprised.
[00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:53.562]  I'm a little bit surprised that they were that much in the open, but I don't think many of us would be surprised if they're not preparing for that.
[00:14:53.562 --> 00:15:00.126]  I mean, we see it at times of, you know, like hurricanes, like we saw in New Orleans.
[00:15:00.126 --> 00:15:04.228]  We see a little bit of that even in my district now, coming out of the storm Ike.
[00:15:04.228 --> 00:15:07.510]  You know, there's some authoritarian approaches in some of our areas.
[00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:16.932]  So, no, the atmosphere is set for that, and it's a consequence of so much that we've done incorrectly since 9-11.
[00:15:16.932 --> 00:15:20.132]  I mean, we've given up so much of our freedom.
[00:15:20.132 --> 00:15:32.835]  So, the military state is available there for somebody who can scare the American people enough to say, look, if we don't take care of you and have martial law, there's going to be total chaos.
[00:15:32.835 --> 00:15:35.235]  We do live in very, very dangerous times.
[00:15:35.615 --> 00:15:42.084]  Yeah, and that will destroy confidence right there of their food riots, and then the socialism isn't going to be able to pay for it with worthless dollars.
[00:15:42.084 --> 00:15:43.806]  Final question.
[00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:45.208]  He's on record.
[00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:52.618]  Barack Obama has now come out, and I believe they're both horrible, just like, you know, you've stated you're saying vote for the Constitution Party.
[00:15:53.258 --> 00:15:54.119]  Yeah, it sure is.
[00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:54.740]  It's just an excuse.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.603]  They've used the environment to socialize this country and to scare and terrify people.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:24.984]  But you know, every time we exhale, we exhale CO2, so how are you going to tell where the CO2 is coming from?
[00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:32.747]  But, you know, it is not to ignore the fact that pollution is bad, we shouldn't do it, but we don't need the federal government, we don't need these regulations.
[00:16:32.747 --> 00:16:37.250]  If somebody is, you know, contaminating your breathing space and your air, there's a
[00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.731]  Perfectly good way of dealing with that through property rights.
[00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:46.413]  You should never be able to buy the right to pollute, so true pollution shouldn't be up for sale.
[00:16:46.413 --> 00:16:51.395]  And yet at the same time, we get hysterical and worry about this over time.
[00:16:51.395 --> 00:16:54.956]  All we're going to do is dig a much bigger hole for ourselves.
[00:16:54.956 --> 00:16:56.256]  Absolutely, Congressman.
[00:16:56.256 --> 00:16:59.497]  You've got so many websites affiliated.
[00:16:59.497 --> 00:17:01.418]  What's the best one for people to visit?
[00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:04.322]  I think probably Campaign for Liberty.
[00:17:04.322 --> 00:17:05.983]  That's where we're most active right now.
[00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:08.684]  CampaignforLiberty.com.
[00:17:08.684 --> 00:17:09.305]  Absolutely.
[00:17:09.305 --> 00:17:11.886]  Congressman, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:17:11.886 --> 00:17:12.907]  How's the family doing?
[00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:13.667]  They're doing fine.
[00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:14.608]  Thank you for asking.
[00:17:14.608 --> 00:17:16.269]  Alright, tell them I said hi and take care, sir.
[00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:17.289]  Thank you.
[00:17:17.289 --> 00:17:25.313]  Alright, there goes Congressman Ron Paul with us for about 18 minutes of the radio transmission today.
[00:17:25.313 --> 00:17:26.114]  For those that don't know,
[00:17:27.327 --> 00:17:30.309]  Carbon dioxide is one of the four basic ingredients of life.
[00:17:30.309 --> 00:17:33.632]  Sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen.
[00:17:33.632 --> 00:17:36.434]  If you don't have those, you have nothing.
[00:17:36.434 --> 00:17:42.800]  And this is a total tax on life and on every facet of our civilization and society.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.802]  And I see the religionists, that's what they are.
[00:17:45.802 --> 00:17:50.726]  We're talking about building this global utopian society around a carbon tax.
[00:17:50.726 --> 00:17:52.968]  And the new bureaucrats that are going to micromanage our lives.
[00:17:54.153 --> 00:17:56.314]  That certainly isn't the withering away of the state, is it?
[00:17:56.314 --> 00:17:59.594]  It is the ballooning of the state.
[00:17:59.594 --> 00:18:10.878]  And all the nightmares, the CPS kidnapping children, the society breaking down, the forced inoculations, it's all a byproduct of the social engineers.
[00:18:10.878 --> 00:18:15.199]  It's all a byproduct of the eugenicist, of the theosophic society.
[00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:16.119]  This is what they push!
[00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:19.840]  They're going to wither away that state after they first grow the state.
[00:18:21.113 --> 00:18:28.935]  And it's all funded by the big elite banks because they cynically know the public wants to hear about a free lunch.
[00:18:28.935 --> 00:18:32.276]  Well, there is no such thing as a free lunch.
[00:18:32.276 --> 00:18:37.317]  There's a lot of well-meaning, bleeding hearts out there who I know are good people.
[00:18:37.317 --> 00:18:42.019]  Just like I know family I've got that literally worship George W. Bush.
[00:18:42.019 --> 00:18:44.439]  Not my close family, but some cousins and people.
[00:18:44.439 --> 00:18:50.201]  And I just feel sorry for them because they will get hateful, they will argue with me, they will tell me I'm wrong, they'll tell me I'm a communist.
[00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:56.193]  Uh, just like liberals will call me a closed-minded, you know, idiot right-winger, I'm not.
[00:18:56.193 --> 00:19:03.619]  I'm somebody who studied human dynamics, society, how things operate, how humans behave, and I know what the elite are pushing.
[00:19:03.619 --> 00:19:04.559]  I know there are scams.
[00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:07.481]  I know there are different programs of control.
[00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:12.345]  And, uh, all we try to do is tell the truth here and give people the best information that we can.
[00:19:12.345 --> 00:19:13.025]  Are we perfect?
[00:19:13.025 --> 00:19:14.226]  Certainly not.
[00:19:14.226 --> 00:19:17.469]  But, uh, there's no doubt that this is collectivism.
[00:19:17.469 --> 00:19:18.730]  This is the New World Order.
[00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.870]  This is social engineering.
[00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:20.591]  This is serfdom.
[00:19:21.317 --> 00:19:23.158]  This is slavery.
[00:19:23.158 --> 00:19:32.122]  Christopher Ketchum's joining us, expert on the surveillance grid, the core system, the Israeli spy rings, all of it, coming up in T-minus 40 minutes.
[00:19:32.122 --> 00:19:39.505]  Pat Carmack, the producer of The Money Masters, will be joining us for a couple hours to talk about the financial crisis taking place.
[00:19:39.505 --> 00:19:42.567]  He's a banker in his own right and expert on the monetary system.
[00:19:43.327 --> 00:19:48.652]  And we will also be taking your calls coming up throughout the broadcast today.
[00:19:48.652 --> 00:19:54.377]  I'm going to give you the latest financial news, a bunch of really important vaccination news as well.

[00:21:01.114 --> 00:21:02.675]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:02.675 --> 00:21:08.956]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:08.956 --> 00:21:13.117]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.117 --> 00:21:15.058]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.058 --> 00:21:17.498]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:17.498 --> 00:21:24.260]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and weaker.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.481]  We're good to go.

[00:21:59.978 --> 00:22:06.720]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.361]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:10.922]  But who is the enemy?
[00:22:10.922 --> 00:22:11.722]  Bin Laden.
[00:22:11.722 --> 00:22:12.582]  This is his ammo.
[00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:14.103]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:22:14.103 --> 00:22:15.503]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:22:16.063 --> 00:22:23.228]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:22:23.228 --> 00:22:23.708]  Some U.S.
[00:22:23.708 --> 00:22:30.053]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:22:30.053 --> 00:22:33.515]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:22:33.755 --> 00:22:43.823]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:22:43.823 --> 00:22:45.264]  Fabled enemies.

[00:23:26.057 --> 00:23:28.179]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.

[00:23:54.963 --> 00:23:55.924]  Act now!
[00:23:55.924 --> 00:24:14.858]  I burn with desire to warn people, to stop injustice, to stop abuse of innocence.
[00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:24.812]  Here's an example.
[00:24:24.812 --> 00:24:45.996]  I was talking to a neighbor today, out in our front yards this morning, and she said, Alex, you know, I've seen you a few times on TV, heard your show a few times, and you know, I agree with a lot of what you have to say, but I can't believe that
[00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:52.029]  Something I heard you mention one of the few times I tuned in, just happened to me.
[00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:58.390]  You know, my son's a sixth grader.
[00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.570]  He's never even been to the principal's office.
[00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:12.332]  He's always had, you know, straight A's, and then he's been talking a few times in class, and the teacher, according to him, and she said, I believe him.
[00:25:12.332 --> 00:25:13.792]  By the way, I've talked to the child.
[00:25:13.792 --> 00:25:14.973]  He's pretty nice.
[00:25:14.973 --> 00:25:17.033]  A few times, you know, out running around the neighborhood.
[00:25:18.392 --> 00:25:27.456]  Um, a whole bunch of the children in their class are given tickets by the police officer.
[00:25:27.456 --> 00:25:30.757]  The police officers that are all over the little prison.
[00:25:30.757 --> 00:25:33.018]  And then she said, uh, you know, what do I do?
[00:25:33.018 --> 00:25:37.160]  I guess they're just telling me just pay the ticket.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.821]  And she said, but I, you know, she went further and said, but isn't there a judge?
[00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:43.202]  You know, this is a middle class person.
[00:25:43.202 --> 00:25:44.783]  I said, well, of course you have due process.
[00:25:45.723 --> 00:25:49.625]  And then you could demand a jury from that judge.
[00:25:49.625 --> 00:25:52.907]  She said, yeah, but I got the ticket.
[00:25:52.907 --> 00:25:57.270]  So see, that violates due process.
[00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:08.277]  I mean, the law on so many fronts to give a parent a ticket for something their child did and being disruptive in class, talking in class.
[00:26:08.277 --> 00:26:11.999]  Now, notice the state says, don't spank your children or we'll seize them from you.
[00:26:12.611 --> 00:26:16.314]  And they're five times more likely to actually physically abuse them in their system.
[00:26:16.314 --> 00:26:19.917]  But there's no law actually against corporal punishment discipline.
[00:26:19.917 --> 00:26:22.780]  But they'll still seize your children when there is no law.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:28.604]  Kind of like they'll seize your children when there is no law to take vaccines.
[00:26:28.604 --> 00:26:30.506]  It's all colored of law.
[00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:35.530]  See how lawless that is?
[00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.853]  And then by the time they get to the police station, they'll always find something else to charge you with.
[00:26:40.293 --> 00:26:49.155]  So I had to sit there in the front yard and explain to her for about five minutes that here's the Constitution, here's the Bill of Rights.
[00:26:49.155 --> 00:26:51.336]  You ever watch Perry Mason?
[00:26:51.336 --> 00:26:55.997]  You get to challenge your accusers, it gets to be brought out.
[00:26:55.997 --> 00:27:03.599]  Is that applicable in the code for talking to charge someone for being disruptive, i.e.
[00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:04.640]  disorderly conduct?
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.420]  No, it's a fraud!
[00:27:07.188 --> 00:27:17.616]  But the state at every level is attempting to force things on the people that are completely and totally tyrannical.
[00:27:17.616 --> 00:27:19.317]  They prey on the public.
[00:27:19.317 --> 00:27:21.579]  The system feeds on the public.
[00:27:21.579 --> 00:27:26.683]  Fences around the schools, ID cards, drug dogs being frisked, drug tested now.
[00:27:27.782 --> 00:27:40.288]  When the government ships the illegal drugs in, controls them, and then pushes legal, dangerous pharmaceuticals, whose molecular makeup is in most cases more dangerous than the most deadly narcotics?
[00:27:40.288 --> 00:27:41.049]  It's a joke!
[00:27:41.049 --> 00:27:42.610]  I mean, that they're bankrupt!
[00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.431]  Intellectually!
[00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:46.412]  Morally!
[00:27:46.412 --> 00:27:47.072]  Financially!
[00:27:47.072 --> 00:27:50.914]  I mean, the government is a pack of corrupt criminals!
[00:27:50.914 --> 00:27:51.714]  That's the bottom line!
[00:27:51.714 --> 00:27:52.695]  Are there some good people in there?
[00:27:52.695 --> 00:27:53.295]  Yes!
[00:27:53.295 --> 00:27:54.936]  But the system itself is bad!
[00:27:54.936 --> 00:27:55.897]  It's predatory!
[00:27:55.897 --> 00:27:56.597]  It preys on us!
[00:28:00.226 --> 00:28:16.121]  So I sat there and explained to her the most rudimentary basics, and that's how they're able to prey on people, because I know in Houston, and I've seen stories all over the country, but right here in Texas, I remember seeing a story six, seven, eight years ago.
[00:28:16.121 --> 00:28:24.989]  This is about eight years ago, where if you don't do your homework, they quote, find the parents.
[00:28:24.989 --> 00:28:26.330]  Well, there's no law there.
[00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:39.728]  The truancy law, you know, says so many days missed, but they misappropriate the law, misapply it, and say, oh, well, we're going to say that's truancy, and the parents don't know, and they get a $500 ticket.
[00:28:39.728 --> 00:28:45.492]  She got a $500 ticket for her son talking in class.
[00:28:45.492 --> 00:28:55.539]  Instead of being taken to the office and getting some pops, or the choice, you can take three licks, or you can go run around the football stadium until you throw up, or up and down the bleachers.
[00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.571]  Something good, teach you some discipline.
[00:28:58.571 --> 00:29:00.953]  No, we're gonna get you into the criminal system.
[00:29:00.953 --> 00:29:03.615]  We're gonna fine your mother.
[00:29:03.615 --> 00:29:05.797]  And we're gonna break the law of misapplying that.
[00:29:05.797 --> 00:29:07.878]  That's racketeering in these schools.
[00:29:07.878 --> 00:29:15.443]  That's what it is when an organized group of people engage in fraud and lies and deceit to coerce things out of people.
[00:29:15.443 --> 00:29:16.404]  It's racketeering.
[00:29:16.404 --> 00:29:17.805]  Period!
[00:29:17.805 --> 00:29:23.789]  Lying and saying it's the law, you gotta take vaccines is racketeering.
[00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:24.590]  There is no law.
[00:29:25.754 --> 00:29:39.528]  We're trying to pass one in New Jersey, trying to pass one, some in England, trying to pass some in Europe, Australia, trying to pass some in D.C., but that's, you know, they haven't, even when you read those laws, it reads like it's the law, but you'll notice it isn't.
[00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:43.692]  So, you have to fight this stuff.
[00:29:43.692 --> 00:29:48.096]  They don't just get to hand you fines, and then say there's nothing you can do.
[00:29:48.096 --> 00:29:48.777]  They're lying.
[00:29:48.777 --> 00:29:49.518]  They know they're lying.
[00:29:51.141 --> 00:29:55.069]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.069 --> 00:29:57.755]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.862 --> 00:30:07.106]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[00:30:07.106 --> 00:30:21.076]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[00:30:21.076 --> 00:30:24.218]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words ozone, do?
[00:30:24.258 --> 00:30:24.938]  I think so.
[00:30:54.212 --> 00:30:54.713]  It is a big idea.
[00:30:54.713 --> 00:30:56.015]  A new world order.
[00:30:56.015 --> 00:30:58.439]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[00:31:10.846 --> 00:31:18.972]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:18.972 --> 00:31:26.317]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.319 --> 00:31:34.761]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:34.761 --> 00:31:38.642]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:38.642 --> 00:31:41.202]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:41.202 --> 00:31:42.363]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:42.363 --> 00:31:43.163]  They're not after money.
[00:31:43.163 --> 00:31:44.443]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:44.443 --> 00:31:45.404]  They're after power.
[00:31:45.404 --> 00:31:46.564]  That's what happens here.
[00:31:46.564 --> 00:31:51.305]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:31:51.305 --> 00:31:54.906]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:54.906 --> 00:31:57.607]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:31:58.047 --> 00:31:59.929]  You have been warned.
[00:31:59.929 --> 00:32:09.216]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:32:09.216 --> 00:32:17.383]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[00:32:17.383 --> 00:32:21.986]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:32:21.986 --> 00:32:24.749]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[00:32:24.749 --> 00:32:26.510]  Now you can fight internal parasites
[00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:26.890]  I don't know.
[00:32:51.857 --> 00:32:53.560]  FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.404]  Again, that's FreshwaterOrganics.com or call 888-949-3570.
[00:33:06.108 --> 00:33:08.790]  This is a call from Christopher Ketchum.
[00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:20.037]  He's going to be on next Monday or Tuesday about the whole surveillance grid, the core system, as it's called.
[00:33:20.037 --> 00:33:23.920]  The fact that most of it is run by a foreign government.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.121]  We cover a lot of that in Fabled Enemies, i.e.
[00:33:26.121 --> 00:33:26.362]  Israel.
[00:33:26.362 --> 00:33:27.782]  But his flight is delayed and
[00:33:35.191 --> 00:33:40.593]  He doesn't think he'll be able to make it until later in the show, and then we already have guests set up then.
[00:33:40.593 --> 00:33:46.895]  So we'll move, um, journalist Christopher Ketchum, award-winning journalist about Israeli backdoor technology penetrating the U.S.
[00:33:46.895 --> 00:33:52.076]  government's telecom system and the main court system.
[00:33:52.076 --> 00:33:52.756]  That is too bad.
[00:33:52.756 --> 00:33:56.617]  I was really looking forward to that, but hey, we'll do it next week.
[00:33:56.617 --> 00:33:58.198]  Or we can hope his flights
[00:34:00.245 --> 00:34:03.567]  Aren't delayed too much and cancel Pat Carmack, but I just don't want to do that.
[00:34:03.567 --> 00:34:06.529]  I want to get into the financial stuff, but we will cover that next week.
[00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:09.311]  Don't want to penalize the other guest.
[00:34:09.311 --> 00:34:11.612]  Been working to get Christopher Ketchum on for months.
[00:34:11.612 --> 00:34:13.313]  Guy's hard to get on.
[00:34:13.313 --> 00:34:16.835]  By the way, there's some really big guests next week, and no, it's not Willie Nelson.
[00:34:16.835 --> 00:34:19.216]  Willie Nelson is on the show next week.
[00:34:19.216 --> 00:34:20.057]  Talked to him yesterday.
[00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:24.760]  He's got to check some more of his schedule, but he's going to be on the show next week.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:29.343]  Talk about a host of issues, and yeah, I'm going to be speaking at
[00:34:31.323 --> 00:34:32.304]  A very special event.
[00:34:32.304 --> 00:34:34.145]  It's the last time they'll be at the Backyard.
[00:34:34.145 --> 00:34:40.168]  It's been there for almost 30 years out in the Texas Hill Country outside Austin.
[00:34:40.168 --> 00:34:41.809]  Jesse Ventura is coming in Saturday.
[00:34:41.809 --> 00:34:48.192]  We'll be interviewing him, hanging out with him, going out to Willie's World Headquarters and doing an interview with the two of them together.
[00:34:48.192 --> 00:34:51.814]  That should be extremely interesting.
[00:34:51.814 --> 00:34:53.215]  On 9-11 Truth and a lot more.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:35:09.297]  Have some speeches and stream it live and free over the internet on my servers at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com next, not this Sunday, but the Sunday after next about eight, nine days from now.
[00:35:09.297 --> 00:35:12.860]  It'll be technical about nine days from now.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.021]  There's confusion about this.
[00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:17.283]  I've even told my family repeatedly and they don't seem to understand.
[00:35:19.341 --> 00:35:24.822]  So before I get into the other news and take your calls, let me be clear, we're going to now have calls all throughout the next hour.
[00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:34.824]  Plenty of time now to get to Matt who disagrees, you go to the headline, Alex Jeff, another Matt, James, and others.
[00:35:34.824 --> 00:35:45.547]  Willie Nelson was on this show a few months ago, and a caller called in and said, you want to have a big 9-11 Truth concert.
[00:35:45.547 --> 00:35:47.007]  And a benefit for first responders.
[00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:55.850]  But then the issue came up of trying to rent a fairgrounds or a big place, and then if it's free, how do you give money to first responders?
[00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:58.031]  And then we looked at, Willie works hard.
[00:35:58.031 --> 00:35:59.912]  I mean, he's making two movies right now.
[00:35:59.912 --> 00:36:02.894]  He's touring about 20 days a month.
[00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:06.576]  And he's also got some young, young children.
[00:36:06.576 --> 00:36:07.577]  Willie's a busy fella.
[00:36:07.577 --> 00:36:09.358]  What a renaissance man.
[00:36:09.358 --> 00:36:11.659]  And so I set up some, I set up a date.
[00:36:11.659 --> 00:36:13.460]  It was going to be out of Travis County Fairgrounds.
[00:36:14.352 --> 00:36:16.253]  Overlooking, you look down and see the skyline.
[00:36:16.253 --> 00:36:20.434]  50,000 people could have got in.
[00:36:20.434 --> 00:36:24.135]  And just there weren't the dates this year to get it done.
[00:36:24.135 --> 00:36:26.335]  He was going to have to come into town.
[00:36:26.335 --> 00:36:29.836]  He's playing for a cancer benefit.
[00:36:29.836 --> 00:36:32.297]  He's playing for a couple other benefits.
[00:36:32.297 --> 00:36:36.638]  And there just wasn't really the time to do it.
[00:36:36.638 --> 00:36:40.119]  Unless he, you know, flew in on one day to do it sometime in October.
[00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:42.940]  So he said, look, let's just do this.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.142]  And he said, in the future, we'll do a bigger event.
[00:36:46.142 --> 00:36:47.382]  Lord knows it'll need to be done.
[00:36:47.382 --> 00:36:49.623]  Anti-war, 9-11 truth.
[00:36:49.623 --> 00:36:59.249]  He said, just, um, you and Ventura come and speak at my event, The Last Backyard, before they move it to a bigger venue.
[00:36:59.249 --> 00:37:01.450]  It holds about, I don't know, seven, eight thousand.
[00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:10.415]  You can cram more than that in, but the point is, by the time I even knew about this a month and a half ago, you know, when we switched it,
[00:37:12.282 --> 00:37:13.983]  His events pretty much all sell out.
[00:37:13.983 --> 00:37:16.685]  It was already like 98% sold out.
[00:37:16.685 --> 00:37:18.366]  You know because it's not a benefit.
[00:37:18.366 --> 00:37:20.848]  It's one of his concerts.
[00:37:20.848 --> 00:37:25.271]  And so we're streaming it out live over the web for free for everybody.
[00:37:25.271 --> 00:37:26.632]  That's the event.
[00:37:26.632 --> 00:37:33.257]  Now you can get tickets from scalpers out there.
[00:37:33.257 --> 00:37:37.640]  But I mean that's basically it if you physically want to get there.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.683]  I kind of waited too late to get tickets for family because I mean they're giving me like 10
[00:37:41.949 --> 00:37:43.130]  Tickets or passes.
[00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.091]  Because Willie's got like 150 guests.
[00:37:45.091 --> 00:37:48.173]  I mean, backstage is going to be insane.
[00:37:48.173 --> 00:37:57.680]  And, uh, so... I mean, I've even bought a few tickets for, well, for Ted Anderson and his wife.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:02.984]  I mean, it's that packed, ladies and gentlemen, and I had to buy tickets because I've got quite a crew.
[00:38:02.984 --> 00:38:03.805]  I don't even think I have 10.
[00:38:03.805 --> 00:38:06.567]  It's something like I can have 10 people total.
[00:38:06.567 --> 00:38:09.829]  And maybe even less now because it's so packed and, you know, the fire marshal
[00:38:12.165 --> 00:38:20.351]  And yeah, there's supposedly going to be some other big celebrity guests there that will probably be speaking out against the whole New World Order system.
[00:38:20.351 --> 00:38:21.572]  I'm going to leave that alone, though.
[00:38:21.572 --> 00:38:24.514]  I'm not going to say their names.
[00:38:24.514 --> 00:38:29.057]  But that is coming up, not this Sunday, but next Sunday.
[00:38:29.057 --> 00:38:35.682]  And we're going to be out there streaming live over the web for everybody at InfoWars.com.
[00:38:35.682 --> 00:38:36.683]  It's going to be free.
[00:38:36.683 --> 00:38:38.184]  It's going to be there.
[00:38:39.261 --> 00:38:41.282]  It's going to cost us a lot of money to send it out.
[00:38:41.282 --> 00:38:42.442]  Willie was offering to pay for it.
[00:38:42.442 --> 00:38:44.623]  I said, no, I'll pay for it.
[00:38:44.623 --> 00:38:46.083]  And you know, it's just an interesting event.
[00:38:46.083 --> 00:38:48.644]  So, so that's, that's basically it.
[00:38:48.644 --> 00:38:50.845]  I always tell things in too much detail.
[00:38:50.845 --> 00:38:51.285]  What does it matter?
[00:38:51.285 --> 00:38:56.466]  I could have simplified that, but I have simplified it a few times and talked about it and people didn't understand.
[00:38:56.466 --> 00:38:57.187]  So it's simple.
[00:38:57.187 --> 00:39:04.749]  We announced this big giant event and there just wasn't time to do that because things were scheduled out six months a year in advance.
[00:39:04.749 --> 00:39:07.870]  Farm Aid scheduled out, you know, a year in advance where they're going to have what they're going to do.
[00:39:08.613 --> 00:39:10.054]  And so we're having this event.
[00:39:10.054 --> 00:39:13.857]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:13.857 --> 00:39:28.267]  I'm just thinking how strange it is, growing up, never imagining I'd be, uh, not just hanging out with Willie Nelson, but Jesse Ventura at the same time, and talking about government-sponsored terrorism and the New World Order.
[00:39:28.267 --> 00:39:34.011]  It is, uh, truth is truly stranger than fiction.
[00:39:34.011 --> 00:39:35.812]  I told you some of the other people that are coming at it now.
[00:39:36.776 --> 00:40:01.726]  It's pretty interesting, but that doesn't matter really compared to all, as interesting as that is, we have this global financial meltdown happening, we have this new world order taking over, we have the social engineering going into the next phase, I mean we face a lot of really serious obstacles, but the good news is, as more prominent people that have a lot to lose speak up and say really bold things, like 9-11 is an inside job that blew the buildings up,
[00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:24.360]  Whether it's an Italian president, or a German defense minister, or a best actress this year, or Rick Linklater, or across the political spectrum, that really shows other people courage and allows us to have a mass awakening to government-sponsored terror, and then to other staged events like the controlled financial implosion that we are witnessing.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.460]  And so it's a gauge.
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.041]  You know, it's a gauge.
[00:40:27.754 --> 00:40:34.539]  By how many prominent people on all spectrum, all areas of the political spectrum, are now awake to world government.
[00:40:34.539 --> 00:40:37.861]  And what's happening, and then the left-right paradigm is shattering.
[00:40:37.861 --> 00:40:41.924]  That's why the establishment loves Barack Obama so much.
[00:40:41.924 --> 00:40:45.686]  And understand, I'm not making a judgment.
[00:40:45.686 --> 00:40:49.069]  I don't hate Barack Obama or John McCain, they're pathetic puppets.
[00:40:49.875 --> 00:40:59.943]  I just know that there are articles and headlines where there are mainstream media saying, Barack Obama is their Jesus, and you know, change we can believe in, everything's going to be like heaven now, Valhalla.
[00:40:59.943 --> 00:41:02.525]  And I'm sorry, he's bought and paid for by the New World Order.
[00:41:02.525 --> 00:41:06.969]  He's going to bring in world taxation, world regulation, and hand everything over to the private central banks.
[00:41:06.969 --> 00:41:08.170]  That's what the carbon tax is.
[00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:11.232]  They've proposed it, they've said it, we told you they'd implode the economy.
[00:41:11.232 --> 00:41:16.917]  Call for world standardization of currency and a global carbon tax, and regulators in your house every week.
[00:41:16.917 --> 00:41:18.358]  Controlling every facet of what you do.
[00:41:19.551 --> 00:41:20.952]  And they're doing it!
[00:41:20.952 --> 00:41:26.354]  And I'm sorry, a lot of you want to get suckered and believe Barack Obama's going to save you.
[00:41:26.354 --> 00:41:30.035]  He's not going to save you, John McCain's not going to save you, because they don't run anything.
[00:41:30.035 --> 00:41:35.738]  The only reason Barack Obama matters is that he is able to sucker people when John McCain isn't.
[00:41:35.738 --> 00:41:37.659]  He's better at suckering people.
[00:41:37.659 --> 00:41:41.080]  Because people look on the surface, oh, his daddy's a black man.
[00:41:42.737 --> 00:41:52.003]  And then now there's all these headlines where people are being told, and it really is happening, well, if you're not for Barack Obama, you're a racist, or if you wear a John McCain shirt, you're a racist.
[00:41:52.003 --> 00:42:00.548]  And, um, so I guess in the future we can only have black presidents, uh, because, uh, you know, if you don't vote for the black man, you're a racist.
[00:42:00.548 --> 00:42:05.691]  I mean, it's just, it's, it's, it's so mindless, but that is a dying dinosaur.
[00:42:05.691 --> 00:42:09.113]  You know, in the polls, uh, you've only got about 60% of the country
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.661]  That really even supports one of the two candidates.
[00:42:12.661 --> 00:42:19.003]  So that gives them each about, you know, I guess 25 and 35 percent, respectively, of the public.
[00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:22.824]  So, you know, they're not suckering everybody.
[00:42:22.824 --> 00:42:35.469]  And a lot of the left, you know, they're going, wow, he was for wiretapping on warrantless, and, you know, he voted for, you know, all these bad things, and, you know, he said he was against NAFTA and GAAP, but now he says he's for it.
[00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:38.230]  And, I mean, if you really look at Barack Obama, he's a corporate whore.
[00:42:38.914 --> 00:42:41.534]  He's not a Muslim terrorist.
[00:42:41.534 --> 00:42:42.595]  He's not a commie.
[00:42:42.595 --> 00:42:45.415]  You know, that's all in the left-right paradigm.
[00:42:45.415 --> 00:42:51.736]  That's his foundation cover in the big Chicago corrupt machine politics.
[00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:53.497]  That's where he made his bones in politics.
[00:42:53.497 --> 00:42:59.258]  That's where he came from, was the controlled left foundation system.
[00:42:59.258 --> 00:42:59.858]  That's a fact.
[00:42:59.858 --> 00:43:02.778]  The Annenberg Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:43:02.778 --> 00:43:05.679]  I mean, he's a front, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:05.679 --> 00:43:06.279]  He's a total
[00:43:07.196 --> 00:43:08.857]  And complete front of the New World Order.
[00:43:08.857 --> 00:43:10.858]  And you're going to find that out.
[00:43:10.858 --> 00:43:11.659]  Understand something.
[00:43:11.659 --> 00:43:13.900]  I never go for what's popular.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.582]  I say what I really believe.
[00:43:16.582 --> 00:43:20.224]  Because who am I if I don't say what I believe and know?
[00:43:20.224 --> 00:43:21.545]  That's who I am.
[00:43:21.545 --> 00:43:25.107]  That's what's valuable to me is ideas and information and research.
[00:43:25.107 --> 00:43:33.272]  And that's why I went on air years before 9-11 and talked about government-sponsored terrorism and talked about Oklahoma City being an inside job and 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 made a film in 97.
[00:43:36.934 --> 00:43:46.581]  That's why in the, really the year before 9-11, I said they're going to stage a big terror attack, but I was sure of it by late July of 2001.
[00:43:46.581 --> 00:43:53.125]  I'd seen the PNAC documents, seen them introducing Bin Laden on the news, a lot of people noticed that.
[00:43:53.125 --> 00:44:03.732]  And, you know, to go on air, and my show had more AM and FM affiliates in late mid and late 2001,
[00:44:07.048 --> 00:44:08.609]  That it has now.
[00:44:08.609 --> 00:44:12.791]  It had actually gotten up to over 80 affiliates.
[00:44:12.791 --> 00:44:14.912]  Because I was bashing Bill Clinton.
[00:44:14.912 --> 00:44:16.673]  I was bashing his New World Order agenda.
[00:44:16.673 --> 00:44:20.274]  I was talking about, you know, the Second Amendment and property rights.
[00:44:20.274 --> 00:44:21.575]  As I always do.
[00:44:21.575 --> 00:44:34.761]  And so, a lot of mom-and-pop stations, and even smaller chains, smaller groups of stations, corporate-owned, were putting me on the air, and they were getting good ratings out of it.
[00:44:34.761 --> 00:44:35.502]  And I went on air,
[00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:42.693]  And I'm talking about the journey of standing up for what you believe in and not compromising.
[00:44:42.693 --> 00:44:49.278]  I'm not tooting my horn, but I mean, I'm explaining who I am and why I do what I do.
[00:44:49.278 --> 00:44:50.318]  And do I do a perfect job?
[00:44:50.318 --> 00:44:51.579]  Do I put things to the best?
[00:44:51.579 --> 00:44:52.300]  Do I make mistakes?
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.981]  Absolutely.
[00:44:54.981 --> 00:44:56.703]  But, I went on air on 9-11,
[00:44:58.248 --> 00:44:59.008]  And we were getting calls.
[00:44:59.008 --> 00:45:01.889]  Stations were already dropping us, going, you know, this guy's crazy.
[00:45:01.889 --> 00:45:03.330]  He's saying, call the White House every day.
[00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:05.231]  They're going to probably attack the World Trade Center.
[00:45:05.231 --> 00:45:06.831]  They're going to set up a police state.
[00:45:06.831 --> 00:45:13.774]  You know, George Bush is, you know, we know he's not perfect, but, you know, our sponsors don't like it.
[00:45:13.774 --> 00:45:18.476]  And, you know, we were losing 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 affiliates leading up in those few months.
[00:45:18.476 --> 00:45:19.856]  And then 9-11 happened.
[00:45:19.856 --> 00:45:21.597]  And I went on Derry Brownfield's show that day.
[00:45:22.617 --> 00:45:25.938]  I said it was an inside job, and he lost a bunch of affiliates, and they let me know.
[00:45:25.938 --> 00:45:31.100]  They said, well, you can call in every once in a while, but you are banned from the show as a guest.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:38.882]  And, uh, Michael Trudeau, who had been working for Genesis for four years then, or three and a half years, never told me what to say or what to do.
[00:45:38.882 --> 00:45:39.922]  He called me.
[00:45:39.922 --> 00:45:41.183]  He was the program director.
[00:45:41.183 --> 00:45:44.864]  I'm going to go to your calls in a minute.
[00:45:44.864 --> 00:45:49.245]  And he said, look, I'm not telling you what to say, but you're not going to basically have a radio show soon.
[00:45:49.245 --> 00:45:52.326]  You'll just be on the internet and shortwave and satellite.
[00:45:53.816 --> 00:45:56.798]  Uh, you're not going to basically have any affiliates if you keep this shop.
[00:45:56.798 --> 00:45:59.640]  You know, this is like two days into 9-11, September 13th.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.541]  I remember the call getting a few days later.
[00:46:02.541 --> 00:46:05.983]  He said, they're calling, they're dumping you, they're dropping, they're saying they don't want to drop you.
[00:46:05.983 --> 00:46:19.251]  A lot of stations are saying, in fact, in an email, Brownfields people even said, hey look, we know, Jeff said, yeah, we know, you're right, and it's going to come out later, because they're smart.
[00:46:19.251 --> 00:46:21.273]  But people aren't ready for this.
[00:46:21.273 --> 00:46:21.973]  And so, you're banned.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.801]  Then I mentioned that a few years later, and they didn't like that either, but you know what?
[00:46:26.801 --> 00:46:27.501]  Derry's a great guy.
[00:46:27.501 --> 00:46:29.682]  He's on the network, and we gave him a home.
[00:46:29.682 --> 00:46:39.085]  You know, he should just carry his show, but after the other network kicked him out for talking about Monsanto, the poisonous crops, the deadly crops, you know, he got... See how that works, Derry?
[00:46:39.085 --> 00:46:43.687]  You told the truth there, too, so that's why I respect you, and you lost that network you've been a founder of.
[00:46:43.687 --> 00:46:45.567]  You got pushed out of it.
[00:46:45.567 --> 00:46:46.748]  But now he's here on Genesis.
[00:46:46.748 --> 00:46:47.928]  My point is, I'm not criticizing him.
[00:46:47.928 --> 00:46:49.049]  He's a great guy.
[00:46:49.049 --> 00:46:52.770]  An icon of agriculture reporting and fighting the World War, period.
[00:46:53.675 --> 00:47:02.542]  But Trudeau said, look, do what you want, but your show was over 80 stations, and now it's 50 stations, and it's about to be even less.
[00:47:02.542 --> 00:47:07.246]  And we got driven down to about 20 stations.
[00:47:07.246 --> 00:47:09.508]  Now, we built back up to about 65.
[00:47:09.508 --> 00:47:11.529]  We gained like four more affiliates in the last month.
[00:47:11.529 --> 00:47:12.550]  I need to cut liners for them.
[00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:16.994]  I know they've been asking for it.
[00:47:16.994 --> 00:47:19.916]  And, you know, I wasn't sad.
[00:47:19.916 --> 00:47:20.837]  I wasn't upset about that.
[00:47:21.994 --> 00:47:31.682]  Mike, I just got fired a few years ago from the number, you know, big talk station that you were carrying, syndicating on just a shortwave and satellite and a few stations at the time.
[00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:35.045]  And I said, I'm, you know, I'll go back to just being on shortwave of the internet.
[00:47:35.045 --> 00:47:44.613]  I mean, that's, I'm not gonna, we're not gonna have any future if we don't expose the fact this was an inside job.
[00:47:44.613 --> 00:47:45.073]  And, um,
[00:47:48.757 --> 00:47:55.663]  You know, he, on his own show, broke from that and said it wasn't an inside job, and got upset when the listeners didn't like it, and he ended up leaving.
[00:47:55.663 --> 00:48:02.088]  But the point is, Ted Anderson stood behind me the entire time, and so did Michael, to a certain extent.
[00:48:02.088 --> 00:48:05.131]  And, um, both, you know, good guys.
[00:48:05.131 --> 00:48:09.194]  But Ted totally stood behind me and said, hey, do whatever you want.
[00:48:09.194 --> 00:48:11.196]  You know, free speech.
[00:48:11.196 --> 00:48:14.939]  But, um, it's one thing to talk about how
[00:48:16.031 --> 00:48:25.675]  You know, you're not going to compromise, but you try actually being on 80-something stations and losing 40-plus of them, 50-something of them.
[00:48:25.675 --> 00:48:28.896]  I mean, you try doing that.
[00:48:28.896 --> 00:48:31.778]  You try watching them turn you off.
[00:48:31.778 --> 00:48:33.758]  Okay?
[00:48:33.758 --> 00:48:34.919]  And so that's why
[00:48:35.757 --> 00:48:45.905]  When people threaten me, you know, they call over email and say, have on this guest saying that the Vatican runs everything or we're going to expose you as working for them.
[00:48:45.905 --> 00:48:52.009]  And I'm like, well, if you'd asked nice, I might've had the person on, but now I've looked into them and they're very uncredible.
[00:48:52.009 --> 00:48:54.451]  I'm not saying that the Vatican isn't corrupt, doesn't run a bunch of stuff.
[00:48:54.451 --> 00:49:00.756]  I'm saying you are a terrorist and you're not going to terrorize me into doing what you want.
[00:49:02.928 --> 00:49:07.109]  Or, expose the Scientologists, or you're one of them.
[00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:16.252]  And I'm like, well, I'm not a Scientologist, and I don't particularly like what they do, or some of the things they engage in, but, uh, I'm certainly not going to have the guess you're demanding I have on.
[00:49:16.252 --> 00:49:18.133]  Uh, no.
[00:49:18.133 --> 00:49:21.694]  No, I'm pig-headed.
[00:49:21.694 --> 00:49:29.396]  That's why I've probably gotten 500 emails saying, well, I'm not going to listen anymore because you were mean to the Zeitgeist guy, and, uh,
[00:49:30.609 --> 00:49:36.771]  And basically you're a dumb Christian, and so we're not going to let you show anymore.
[00:49:36.771 --> 00:49:38.432]  You know, it's not that I don't care.
[00:49:38.432 --> 00:49:45.014]  I do care, but I am who I am, and I can't stop telling the truth as I know it.
[00:49:45.014 --> 00:49:57.499]  And it's unfair when I'm saying, no, a bird builds a nest because of instincts, ingrained programming, and somebody says, no, they build it because they're taught how.
[00:49:59.193 --> 00:50:05.895]  And I'm saying, well, that's just not, that they can take eggs away and incubate them and then have the birds hatch out without their parents and they build the same nest.
[00:50:05.895 --> 00:50:06.715]  It's not true!
[00:50:06.715 --> 00:50:09.196]  And they're just, shut up, you're a dumb Christian!
[00:50:09.196 --> 00:50:11.577]  I'm like, it's, I'm not talking about that!
[00:50:11.577 --> 00:50:15.138]  I didn't bring up the whole Christian thing!
[00:50:15.138 --> 00:50:18.459]  Well, you're just a religious, uh, kook!
[00:50:18.459 --> 00:50:21.159]  And I'm like, no, no, spiders innately know how to build a web.
[00:50:21.159 --> 00:50:23.220]  You know, they can take them away from their parents.
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:26.541]  They're, you know, they're, they're hatching eggs and, and, and they'll build the same web.
[00:50:28.462 --> 00:50:30.444]  No, you just can't grasp it, you're not an intellectual.
[00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:36.331]  And I'm like, you know, that's... I get stuck on one point and I'm told I'm wrong about something I know I'm right about.
[00:50:36.331 --> 00:50:46.222]  And then I go do more research on it and I find out that it's a New Age theosophy, which is the New World Order inter-sanctum religion.
[00:50:46.222 --> 00:50:48.906]  And then no one responds to that challenge
[00:50:50.655 --> 00:50:53.380]  And it says, well, how is my religion bad, but this one's okay.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:54.943]  And then they say it's not a religion.
[00:50:54.943 --> 00:50:57.668]  We're going to come back, take your phone calls, get into forced inoculations.
[00:50:57.668 --> 00:50:58.670]  Really key developments there.
[00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:59.031]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.644 --> 00:51:04.926]  Do you want to pay for the government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
[00:51:04.926 --> 00:51:06.886]  You may have no choice.
[00:51:06.886 --> 00:51:10.068]  Obviously, taxpayers are on the hook for over $6 trillion.
[00:51:10.068 --> 00:51:14.630]  That's right, trillion dollars in mortgages held by these two corporations.
[00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:20.613]  The part that most people don't realize is that this bailout can have significant adverse effects on their 401ks and IRAs.
[00:51:22.242 --> 00:51:27.444]  Unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout with your personal retirement funds, you need to act now.
[00:51:27.444 --> 00:51:31.325]  The solution is to fund a self-directed IRA with gold and silver.

[00:51:35.326 --> 00:51:37.286]  SafeGrow IRAs are just a phone call away.
[00:51:37.286 --> 00:51:37.586]  That's 1-866-323-5665.
[00:51:37.586 --> 00:51:40.787]  Microgem and Midas Resources can help you protect your retirement nest egg.
[00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:54.954]  Get informed and ask for our free report on the unseen fallout of the Fannie Freddie rescue.

[00:51:57.856 --> 00:52:04.241]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:52:04.241 --> 00:52:07.743]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.743 --> 00:52:10.385]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.385 --> 00:52:11.927]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.927 --> 00:52:12.707]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.707 --> 00:52:13.668]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:13.668 --> 00:52:15.109]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:16.510]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:17.071 --> 00:52:24.217]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.217 --> 00:52:24.698]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.698 --> 00:52:31.064]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:31.064 --> 00:52:34.507]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.747 --> 00:52:45.031]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:45.031 --> 00:52:46.251]  Fabled enemies.

[00:53:00.754 --> 00:53:07.559]  Benjamin Franklin once said, anyone willing to trade liberty for security deserves neither liberty nor security.
[00:53:07.559 --> 00:53:12.803]  Now, Mercer Films brings you Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.
[00:53:12.803 --> 00:53:16.126]  Domestic spying, wiretapping, government chipping, and more.
[00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:20.530]  People should look one another in the eye before they go killing for causes.
[00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:28.316]  Uncivil Liberties, the movie that will transport you to a society where the government monitors the moves of every citizen in the name of national security.
[00:53:28.316 --> 00:53:29.817]  The whole country's on a bus.
[00:53:30.077 --> 00:53:31.558]  He's a crazy driver.
[00:53:31.558 --> 00:53:35.301]  If the passengers can't get hold of the wheel, we're all going to go over the cliff.

[00:54:04.683 --> 00:54:06.224]  Came and took it all away.
[00:54:06.224 --> 00:54:16.188]  You know, the daily text in here in Austin, the student paper is really on fire against the New World Order.
[00:54:16.188 --> 00:54:19.429]  Because we've woken up so many of those great young people.
[00:54:19.429 --> 00:54:21.730]  Young adults.
[00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:24.191]  New Jersey parents protest mandatory flu shots.
[00:54:26.272 --> 00:54:30.354]  Even linked to a YouTube video exposing the New World Order.
[00:54:30.354 --> 00:54:35.957]  And that dovetails with the USA Today story, Most Health Workers Skip Flu Shot.
[00:54:35.957 --> 00:54:40.399]  They'll try to intimidate you and make you take it, and even use police dogs to scare children doing it.
[00:54:40.399 --> 00:54:42.720]  I'm not kidding, it's on video.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.001]  But then they won't take it!
[00:54:44.784 --> 00:54:46.726]  That system's not going to stand.
[00:54:46.726 --> 00:54:48.648]  It's not going to work, you social engineers.
[00:54:48.648 --> 00:54:54.773]  Okay, Matt, Alex, Jeff, Matt, James, I'm going to take calls and cover some news throughout the next hour, but I'm going to go to your calls right now.
[00:54:54.773 --> 00:54:57.395]  Matt in Michigan, you disagree, so you are first out of the box.
[00:54:57.395 --> 00:54:58.536]  Go ahead.
[00:54:58.536 --> 00:54:59.677]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:54:59.677 --> 00:54:59.998]  Good!
[00:54:59.998 --> 00:55:04.302]  I want to first thank you for waking me up.
[00:55:04.302 --> 00:55:10.027]  I stumbled upon you probably last year after I was beaten, tasered by the cops here in Michigan.
[00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:17.256]  But the thing I disagree about is kind of the way you conducted your interview with Paul Joseph the other day.
[00:55:17.256 --> 00:55:22.422]  I really don't think you gave him fair opportunity to kind of state his points.
[00:55:22.422 --> 00:55:28.689]  Well, he was reading off a piece of paper, most of the time directly out of, you know, scripts that are in Zeitgeist.
[00:55:28.689 --> 00:55:30.351]  You know, my issue was out of the gates.
[00:55:30.351 --> 00:55:31.893]  He said that a bird builds a nest.
[00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:36.573]  Uh, because his parents teach him how, and that's just absolute bull.
[00:55:36.573 --> 00:55:38.935]  I mean, that's admittedly not true.
[00:55:38.935 --> 00:55:44.842]  Again, you can take eggs of birds, and you can take them away, and they will build the exact same nest.
[00:55:44.842 --> 00:55:50.829]  And, uh, I mean, I'm just not gonna, look, look, I mean, right there, and he took, he got this high and mighty attitude.
[00:55:51.528 --> 00:55:56.909]  And then I'm not going to put on airs and put a lisp on and, you know, sit there and go back and forth.
[00:55:56.909 --> 00:55:58.009]  I mean, I know the science.
[00:55:58.009 --> 00:55:59.230]  I know the facts.
[00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:03.010]  And then the basic counter is, well, that's just your Christian dogma.
[00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:08.212]  Actually, most Christians would probably say that the mommy bird does teach the baby bird.
[00:56:08.212 --> 00:56:09.772]  I mean, it wasn't even about that.
[00:56:09.772 --> 00:56:13.773]  It's just anything I brought up about collectivism or anything, you know, you're just small-minded.
[00:56:16.564 --> 00:56:22.068]  You know, humans differ a lot from birds or other things in nature.
[00:56:22.068 --> 00:56:23.049]  You're not listening to me.
[00:56:23.049 --> 00:56:26.131]  He said birds are taught how to build nests.
[00:56:26.131 --> 00:56:27.031]  No, no, no.
[00:56:27.031 --> 00:56:27.732]  I understand that.
[00:56:27.732 --> 00:56:28.112]  I understand.
[00:56:28.112 --> 00:56:29.153]  I don't agree with everything he's saying.
[00:56:29.153 --> 00:56:30.033]  Look, it's not true.
[00:56:30.033 --> 00:56:31.794]  I don't agree with his system.
[00:56:31.794 --> 00:56:32.395]  Hey, listen.
[00:56:32.395 --> 00:56:38.399]  His yogi, this Krishna guy, you ought to go watch videos of his yogi.
[00:56:38.399 --> 00:56:40.180]  He's a babbling idiot.
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.481]  I know all about that.
[00:56:42.481 --> 00:56:43.322]  I don't agree with him.
[00:56:43.322 --> 00:56:44.783]  I don't think his system will ever work.
[00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:49.552]  I know it's impossible for it to work, but he did bring up a lot of good points.
[00:56:49.552 --> 00:56:53.695]  As long as we do have a monetary system, there's always going to be corruption.
[00:56:53.695 --> 00:57:00.338]  And if you want to get away from elitism and money and that aspect, you'd have to get rid of the money to get rid of that.
[00:57:00.338 --> 00:57:02.259]  But it's never going to happen.
[00:57:02.259 --> 00:57:03.240]  I understand that.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:07.302]  But with humans, I think it's a lot more a nurture of the nature anyway.
[00:57:07.302 --> 00:57:10.824]  I know we do have maybe a genetic memory, you can call it.
[00:57:11.488 --> 00:57:13.370]  But, you know, it's all about how you're brought up.
[00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:15.591]  It's all about, you know, what's your talk, you know?
[00:57:15.591 --> 00:57:23.198]  And if you can imagine a world where, you know, everybody was, you know, brought up not to be violent, you know, that's what I think, you know.
[00:57:23.198 --> 00:57:24.959]  He was bringing up saying, well, we wouldn't need guns.
[00:57:24.959 --> 00:57:27.721]  Well, you know, if there was no violence, you know, maybe we wouldn't need it, you know.
[00:57:27.721 --> 00:57:29.543]  But, you know, it's unfeasible.
[00:57:29.543 --> 00:57:33.446]  I think that, uh, you know... Look, here's an example, sir.
[00:57:33.446 --> 00:57:34.507]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:57:36.366 --> 00:57:39.948]  I said, what happens if people don't want to live in this future system?
[00:57:39.948 --> 00:57:43.250]  He said, well, you'll be conditioned, you'll be reconditioned, re-educated.
[00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:52.075]  So I mentioned that he's talking about re-education, and then the Zeitgeist acolytes say, they don't talk about re-education in the film!
[00:57:52.075 --> 00:57:52.575]  I know!
[00:57:52.575 --> 00:57:54.576]  I'm talking about what he said on the show!
[00:57:54.576 --> 00:57:57.778]  It's totally intellectually dishonest!
[00:57:57.778 --> 00:58:02.721]  They will change the debate subjects anytime, and then jump around, and then finally just say, look!
[00:58:03.297 --> 00:58:05.478]  We got giant space alien eggheads!
[00:58:05.478 --> 00:58:07.719]  We're geniuses, you're not!
[00:58:07.719 --> 00:58:15.042]  And I just blow up when people say, look, we're just too intellectual for you, you just can't understand it.
[00:58:15.042 --> 00:58:15.482]  You understand?
[00:58:17.123 --> 00:58:18.543]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.288 --> 00:58:50.992]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.992 --> 00:58:53.173]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[00:58:53.173 --> 00:58:55.575]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:58:55.575 --> 00:58:57.877]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:58:57.877 --> 00:58:59.418]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:58:59.418 --> 00:59:01.119]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:59:01.119 --> 00:59:04.021]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:59:04.021 --> 00:59:07.643]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:59:14.461 --> 00:59:20.323]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:22.004]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:59:41.904 --> 00:59:42.845]  Truth Rising.

[00:59:53.539 --> 00:59:55.942]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.942 --> 00:59:58.705]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.219 --> 01:00:06.540]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.300]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.061]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.061 --> 01:00:11.641]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:13.202]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.202 --> 01:00:17.384]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.384 --> 01:00:21.585]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:24.466]  Okay, key news headline.
[01:00:24.466 --> 01:00:30.568]  New Jersey parents protest mandatory flu shots, but the health workers themselves won't even take it.
[01:00:30.568 --> 01:00:31.689]  That's some of what's coming up.
[01:00:31.689 --> 01:00:33.930]  Let's go back to Matt in Michigan.
[01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:38.593]  Well, what a can of worms I opened.
[01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:40.695]  You can't put that horse back in the barn.
[01:00:40.695 --> 01:00:46.359]  I kind of just stumbled into the whole nest of this.
[01:00:46.359 --> 01:00:50.562]  But we're talking about Zeitgeist continually.
[01:00:50.562 --> 01:00:52.104]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:00:52.104 --> 01:00:54.105]  Yeah, hey, talking about Zeitgeist.
[01:00:54.105 --> 01:00:57.007]  For me, it was just more of a highlight.
[01:00:57.007 --> 01:00:59.709]  You know, you conduct the interview, and anybody that listens to you knows that you
[01:01:00.743 --> 01:01:01.664]  Interrupt quite a bit.
[01:01:01.664 --> 01:01:07.428]  Like I said, I don't think you gave him a fair shot at getting his points across, you know?
[01:01:07.428 --> 01:01:11.872]  Trying to explain where he was coming from with some of the points, you know?
[01:01:11.872 --> 01:01:20.419]  With more generalities, I would sit back for like 10 minutes and then he would start asking me questions.
[01:01:20.419 --> 01:01:22.401]  I would say, go ahead, run!
[01:01:22.401 --> 01:01:29.066]  And then he would just continue to make statements that I know are unequivocally on their face wrong.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.781]  No, to a certain extent.
[01:01:32.781 --> 01:01:34.702]  A lot of stuff that he did say was wrong.
[01:01:34.702 --> 01:01:38.285]  Like I said, I disagree with a lot of what he said.
[01:01:38.285 --> 01:01:39.866]  Here's the deal.
[01:01:39.866 --> 01:01:42.448]  I don't claim it isn't all about me.
[01:01:42.448 --> 01:01:45.450]  I am an aggressive, loud mouth.
[01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:47.271]  But I'm also not stupid.
[01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:49.613]  You know, I mean, I'm not bashing folks who live up in New York.
[01:01:49.613 --> 01:01:50.533]  They're great people.
[01:01:50.533 --> 01:01:52.755]  And we've got three affiliates up there.
[01:01:52.755 --> 01:01:55.437]  Every time I go up there, they think we ride to work in horses.
[01:01:55.437 --> 01:01:57.798]  They think we have outhouses here.
[01:01:57.798 --> 01:01:58.859]  Texas has the fourth
[01:01:59.894 --> 01:02:28.844]  uh... largest city the fifth largest city in the tenth largest city nasa is based here and and and so i think there's some really bad stereotypes like i don't think somebody's black that they're inherently stupid and i don't think because somebody from alabama or because or somebody from nigeria or because somebody from iran they're stupid and uh... and i'm not going to put stereotypes on people in the east uh... but uh... look if you want me to do the show
[01:02:29.514 --> 01:02:32.656]  In a voice like this, I could do an NPR voice.
[01:02:32.656 --> 01:02:35.037]  In fact, I'm going to do an NPR voice for the next 20 minutes.
[01:02:35.037 --> 01:02:36.218]  How's that sound?
[01:02:36.218 --> 01:02:37.198]  Does that sound great?
[01:02:37.198 --> 01:02:40.140]  And I'll talk slow to you.
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:44.102]  Would that, would you think I was real smart?
[01:02:44.102 --> 01:02:45.443]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:02:45.443 --> 01:02:49.725]  Let me, let me talk to you like this.
[01:02:49.725 --> 01:02:52.847]  Birds are taught how to make nests.
[01:02:52.847 --> 01:02:55.469]  No, no, we don't.
[01:02:55.469 --> 01:02:57.590]  No, no, we will be inherently good.
[01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:01.913]  There will be no money, no class, no state.
[01:03:01.913 --> 01:03:03.214]  You will be re-educated.
[01:03:03.214 --> 01:03:06.336]  Oh, the Theophacy Society.
[01:03:06.336 --> 01:03:08.478]  Oh.
[01:03:08.478 --> 01:03:09.439]  Oh.
[01:03:09.439 --> 01:03:11.981]  I'm afraid, Dave.
[01:03:11.981 --> 01:03:13.582]  I'm afraid.
[01:03:13.582 --> 01:03:16.124]  You want me to do Delphi Technique with you?
[01:03:16.124 --> 01:03:19.727]  Do you want me to talk like that?
[01:03:19.727 --> 01:03:22.589]  Matt, are you there?
[01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:24.411]  Matt?
[01:03:24.411 --> 01:03:26.252]  Matt?
[01:03:26.252 --> 01:03:28.154]  Matt, why are you attacking me, Matt?
[01:03:29.545 --> 01:03:33.369]  Matt, all I'm trying to do is give solutions.
[01:03:33.369 --> 01:03:36.332]  Alex Jones never gives solutions.
[01:03:36.332 --> 01:03:39.895]  He just gave about five with Ron Paul earlier.
[01:03:39.895 --> 01:03:47.542]  He just doesn't give simple solutions that you can put on the back of a cereal box.
[01:03:47.542 --> 01:03:54.149]  He tells you to individually awaken and study human activity from a sociological perspective.
[01:03:55.822 --> 01:04:00.706]  But, again, he was born in Texas.
[01:04:00.706 --> 01:04:04.889]  So was Howard Hughes, and he was stupid and bad, too.
[01:04:04.889 --> 01:04:09.472]  No one from Texas can think they drag their knuckles.
[01:04:09.472 --> 01:04:11.914]  They ride horses.
[01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:16.658]  They're stupid and cowardly and bad.
[01:04:16.658 --> 01:04:22.462]  But we, who speak like... I mean, I was watching their guru, the Office of the Society of Gurus,
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.200]  And I watch these gurus.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:31.323]  Now, some of them are actually really smart, but most of them, they'll just sit there on a podium, and then they all pose with each other when they're having discussions.
[01:04:31.323 --> 01:04:36.845]  Just look at each other and go, oh, there will be a future.
[01:04:36.845 --> 01:04:37.906]  Man will change.
[01:04:37.906 --> 01:04:38.506]  Everyone goes, oh!
[01:04:42.232 --> 01:04:44.835]  Well see, I can talk too.
[01:04:44.835 --> 01:04:58.769]  There is a well we stare into and see the black surface of the water, a reflection of the soul and the deepness of infinity, where larks fly in the sky and the stars twinkle.
[01:05:01.534 --> 01:05:05.897]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?

[01:06:30.503 --> 01:06:31.023]  I think so.
[01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:07.284]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:07:07.284 --> 01:07:09.927]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:07:09.927 --> 01:07:11.469]  But who is the enemy?
[01:07:11.469 --> 01:07:12.270]  Bin Laden.
[01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:13.151]  This is his MO.
[01:07:13.151 --> 01:07:14.472]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:07:14.472 --> 01:07:15.193]  We have to look to America.
[01:07:15.213 --> 01:07:15.373]  Some U.S.
[01:07:15.373 --> 01:07:19.017]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:07:30.607 --> 01:07:34.089]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:07:34.089 --> 01:07:37.151]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:08:01.943 --> 01:08:04.730]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:07.516]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:29.039 --> 01:08:31.381]  Your phone calls Alex in Germany.
[01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:32.142]  You're on the air.
[01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:34.143]  Go ahead.
[01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:35.064]  Hi Alex.
[01:08:35.064 --> 01:08:36.565]  Hey, welcome.
[01:08:36.565 --> 01:08:39.348]  Hey, I was just laughing so hard when you did that voice.
[01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:44.732]  I mean, Peter Joseph, he sounds like the computer Hal from the movie 2001, A Space Odyssey.
[01:08:44.732 --> 01:08:46.854]  I'm afraid, Dave.
[01:08:46.854 --> 01:08:47.494]  Exactly.
[01:08:47.494 --> 01:08:49.176]  I'm afraid.
[01:08:49.176 --> 01:08:50.297]  Don't kill me.
[01:08:50.297 --> 01:08:53.900]  And he's knowingly pushing Illuminati communism.
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.401]  I mean, I've studied the communists.
[01:08:55.401 --> 01:08:57.883]  My great-grandfather, he was put in a gulag camp.
[01:08:58.812 --> 01:09:02.456]  And apparently he didn't like the reconditioning.
[01:09:02.456 --> 01:09:06.740]  And I've also studied these Illuminati mystery theosophical groups.
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:11.244]  A few kilometers from where I live is Ingolstadt.
[01:09:11.244 --> 01:09:15.047]  No one said there wouldn't be pain.
[01:09:15.047 --> 01:09:17.470]  We have to do this for the greater good.
[01:09:18.462 --> 01:09:25.749]  Exactly, and you saw how these different New World Order member groups played their good cop, bad cop routine.
[01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:29.613]  Like the Vatican, for example, they said, science is evil.
[01:09:29.613 --> 01:09:38.282]  And then came these Adam Weishaupt guys and they went to these young, talented, educated people and said, look, we are the alternative.
[01:09:39.122 --> 01:09:45.790]  You know, we're going to work in secret and eradicate Christianity, eradicate classism, and create world peace.
[01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:47.552]  I mean, this is the same garbage.
[01:09:47.552 --> 01:09:50.295]  I mean, Peter Joseph... No, I know!
[01:09:50.295 --> 01:09:51.076]  That's what I'm saying!
[01:09:51.076 --> 01:09:52.337]  I watched it!
[01:09:52.337 --> 01:09:58.544]  And all these 9-11 truthers and people that are against the Federal Reserve, they're calling me going, what, you don't think 9-11 is an inside job?
[01:10:00.066 --> 01:10:01.528]  You don't think the Federal Reserve is bad?
[01:10:01.528 --> 01:10:03.270]  I'm like, that's not what I'm saying!
[01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:07.134]  And then they want to argue about Christianity, and I'm saying, forget all that!
[01:10:07.134 --> 01:10:18.867]  What I'm saying is, this is the inner New World Order doctrine, repackaged, and then it turns out it's, now I've looked at it, both films are actually Theosophic Society packages.
[01:10:18.867 --> 01:10:20.929]  And again, I don't want to spend all day on it,
[01:10:21.923 --> 01:10:25.985]  Because, you know, it's only one small part of a larger system.
[01:10:25.985 --> 01:10:29.147]  It's just, it's just, I hate seeing people get fooled.
[01:10:29.147 --> 01:10:36.191]  You know, I hate seeing mothers that think it's the law, they gotta shoot their kids up with vaccines full of mercury, and they're just not gonna believe me.
[01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:39.332]  So, you know, people didn't believe 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:10:39.332 --> 01:10:40.193]  It's gonna take time.
[01:10:41.554 --> 01:10:42.014]  Exactly.
[01:10:42.014 --> 01:10:52.621]  The second thing I wanted to bring up is we did an interview with a German law professor and he's the guy who almost stopped the European Union centralization process in Germany and Austria.
[01:10:53.477 --> 01:10:59.381]  And, uh, we interviewed him for our little radio program, and he agreed with us on anything we threw at him.
[01:10:59.381 --> 01:11:07.585]  He knew about the plans for a world government, he heard about the North American Union, he knew about staged government, uh, terror threats.
[01:11:07.585 --> 01:11:08.606]  I mean, he knew it all.
[01:11:08.606 --> 01:11:09.426]  It was amazing.
[01:11:09.426 --> 01:11:15.710]  This guy's, like, 68 years old, and his lawsuits, his constitutional lawsuits, are responsible
[01:11:16.443 --> 01:11:22.465]  For us now having the chance, the possibility to opt out of the European Union.
[01:11:22.465 --> 01:11:29.727]  I mean, he put that in there when he sued against the Maastricht Treaty, and the other treaties that came afterwards.
[01:11:29.727 --> 01:11:38.309]  Well, the argument of the establishment is, well, world government isn't perfect and it's bad, but it's the structure we need to build the utopia.
[01:11:38.309 --> 01:11:39.789]  And so it needs to be done.
[01:11:39.789 --> 01:11:45.691]  And if you argue with me, I'll just say that you're an intellectual midget and you have no facts, and then just show you a drawing of a spaceship.
[01:11:46.525 --> 01:11:48.265]  And he explained to us... Look, a spaceship!
[01:11:48.265 --> 01:11:49.306]  I mean, that's what the communists would do.
[01:11:49.306 --> 01:11:51.146]  They would show all the farm workers.
[01:11:51.146 --> 01:11:55.327]  We're gonna take you off the farms and take your land and send you into these communes.
[01:11:55.327 --> 01:11:56.007]  Look!
[01:11:56.007 --> 01:11:57.867]  A spaceship picture!
[01:11:57.867 --> 01:11:59.148]  Oh, a spaceship!
[01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:02.228]  Oh my gosh, a spa... It's all glistening cities!
[01:12:02.228 --> 01:12:05.449]  I'm... I'm Florida!
[01:12:05.449 --> 01:12:10.450]  I was reminded of the animated TV adaption of Orwell's Animal Farm.
[01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:16.191]  You know, where the pigs tell the other animals that there's gonna be this technology and everything's gonna be fine.
[01:12:16.923 --> 01:12:34.795]  And so this law professor, Schachtschneider, he explained that they cannot admit that the European Union is a super-state because if they would admit that, the German Supreme Court, the Bundesverfassungsgericht, then would have to say, no, it's illegal, we cannot allow that.
[01:12:34.795 --> 01:12:37.958]  So that's why they don't admit that it's a super-state.
[01:12:37.958 --> 01:12:40.720]  You just don't understand what global governments need.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:47.843]  I don't understand what this is about.
[01:12:47.843 --> 01:12:50.104]  I put up an article without all the quotes.
[01:12:50.104 --> 01:12:51.645]  I translated the quotes.
[01:12:51.645 --> 01:12:55.187]  The whole article is up on the Prison Planet forums.
[01:12:55.187 --> 01:12:57.728]  And so everybody can check that out and see what's going on.
[01:12:57.728 --> 01:12:58.428]  Does he speak English?
[01:13:02.856 --> 01:13:04.156]  No, I translated everything.
[01:13:04.156 --> 01:13:07.257]  I wrote an article in English and put it up on the Prison Plan Forums.
[01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:10.899]  I translated the quotes, the most important quotes from that radio interview.
[01:13:10.899 --> 01:13:13.920]  It's all there so everybody can have a look at it.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:19.321]  Alright, good to hear from you, Alex, in Germany.
[01:13:19.321 --> 01:13:22.502]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Texas.
[01:13:22.502 --> 01:13:25.363]  You're on the air, Jeff.
[01:13:25.363 --> 01:13:25.844]  Hey, Alex.
[01:13:27.907 --> 01:13:31.289]  Look, you know, I wasted an hour and a half watching that addendum yesterday.
[01:13:31.289 --> 01:13:34.951]  I'm surprised you can even talk, being from Texas.
[01:13:34.951 --> 01:13:36.371]  Well, that's the interesting thing.
[01:13:36.371 --> 01:13:38.232]  Oh, you poor thing.
[01:13:38.232 --> 01:13:42.314]  I'm actually a recovered New Age cult member.
[01:13:42.314 --> 01:13:44.075]  Oh, there's no such thing as religion.
[01:13:44.075 --> 01:13:46.756]  More fake Christian dogma.
[01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:51.019]  Meanwhile, we push the Theosophic Society, which worships Lucifer.
[01:13:51.019 --> 01:13:52.439]  But that's the only thing that exists.
[01:13:52.439 --> 01:13:53.520]  Everything else is false.
[01:13:54.204 --> 01:14:00.248]  You're coming at me with your pre-programmed knuckle-dragging Christianism.
[01:14:00.248 --> 01:14:02.930]  No, no, you're not even allowed to comment.
[01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:10.454]  That's nice, Guru, but I've actually been there, done that, and so, you know, what I'm calling to tell people is, you know, I was in the cults.
[01:14:10.454 --> 01:14:11.875]  I did the little seances.
[01:14:11.875 --> 01:14:13.877]  I took the mind-altering substances that
[01:14:14.697 --> 01:14:17.658]  Move it from the realm of belief to experience.
[01:14:17.658 --> 01:14:24.360]  So, you know, that's how they're brainwashing these people, is they get them to experience these altered states of reality with the meditation.
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:41.906]  But the point that I'd like to make is, uh, went to a, uh, a family gathering, uh, called Drums Across the World in 94, and, um, you know, it was a classic family gathering, and when you left, of course, the Nazi cops were at the gate, and, uh,
[01:14:42.731 --> 01:15:03.240]  You know, I just, I looked around and I realized that this whole concept of this, you know, Marxist idealism, which is basically what's going around in all of these new age circles, mixed with the old age theosophy, it was impractical, it was impossible, and none of these kids are learning how to take care of themselves.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:10.443]  And they claim, they claim they're anti-establishment, but the very core of the elite, this is their religion!
[01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:12.529]  It is their religion.
[01:15:12.529 --> 01:15:13.530]  That's all I'm saying!
[01:15:13.530 --> 01:15:17.295]  I'm like... You notice he never wanted to get into the New World Order.
[01:15:17.295 --> 01:15:17.995]  Oh, they're nothing.
[01:15:17.995 --> 01:15:18.576]  They're idiots.
[01:15:18.576 --> 01:15:19.477]  They don't know what they're doing.
[01:15:19.477 --> 01:15:20.458]  We're gonna build something better.
[01:15:20.458 --> 01:15:21.420]  I'm like, no.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.322]  They're building the scientific dictatorship.
[01:15:23.962 --> 01:15:25.483]  Here's the damage he's doing.
[01:15:25.483 --> 01:15:30.026]  His solutions at the end were completely, completely bunk.
[01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:34.749]  The solutions that people need are learn to grow your own food, learn to be self-sufficient.
[01:15:34.749 --> 01:15:38.291]  Decentralization, but it's not simple.
[01:15:38.291 --> 01:15:42.053]  It isn't just a one-line throwaway line.
[01:15:42.053 --> 01:15:48.437]  It means a journey of you getting informed and involved, and not just constantly bumping around inside your head.
[01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:56.524]  Plumbing your inner depths and speaking to spiritual guides, it's about actually getting out there and doing something.
[01:15:56.524 --> 01:16:07.673]  And the way that I made it out of all this New Age cult stuff was, you know, I was always grounded in the biblical Jesus, and they were kind of pushing the world Christ at me to kind of bait me.
[01:16:07.673 --> 01:16:16.620]  And, you know, that was all fine, and I went into it, but when they started pushing that, you know, homosexuality and gender neutrality, which is part of the New Age agenda,
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:23.784]  I think there's a lot of guys just like me that are going to draw the line right there when they try to tell you that Jesus was a homosexual.
[01:16:23.784 --> 01:16:26.785]  It just does not jive with anything that we know historically.
[01:16:26.785 --> 01:16:31.628]  Well, that's the thing is they change it whenever they want and I'm not here bashing, you know, groups and people.
[01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:32.668]  That's right.
[01:16:32.668 --> 01:16:34.109]  But listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:16:34.109 --> 01:16:40.672]  The point, I want to move on to, I believe John in San Francisco, they just told me disagrees and I'm sorry I didn't put him to the head of the line.
[01:16:40.672 --> 01:16:42.253]  But yeah, great points, Jeff.
[01:16:44.703 --> 01:16:54.429]  The whole point about that is I don't want heterosexuals or homosexuals teaching five, six, seven-year-old children about sex in the name of sex education.
[01:16:54.429 --> 01:16:54.790]  It's not.
[01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:56.771]  It's indoctrination.
[01:16:56.771 --> 01:17:03.075]  I want them innocent as long as possible because that's how they're meant to be in that state.
[01:17:03.075 --> 01:17:05.096]  They're not meant to get into sex until they hit puberty.
[01:17:07.452 --> 01:17:15.494]  And then, it's a very special thing to have children and bring the next generation in the world, so, you know, people need to realize that's a big step and a big decision.
[01:17:15.494 --> 01:17:17.935]  Does that mean I wasn't wild?
[01:17:17.935 --> 01:17:19.836]  Does that mean I'm up here judging people?
[01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:25.317]  No, I'm just saying, all this promiscuity is very, very destructive.
[01:17:25.317 --> 01:17:26.478]  Okay?
[01:17:26.478 --> 01:17:30.519]  You know, I'm against wild, uncontrolled genetic engineering in laboratories.
[01:17:30.519 --> 01:17:34.800]  And I'm saying people need to, you know, think about reproduction and think about what sex really is.
[01:17:36.411 --> 01:17:37.071]  I don't know, man.
[01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:46.257]  Once you have children you're taking care of, and once you have people that depend on you, it just becomes... Your whole mindset shifts when you become a parent.
[01:17:46.257 --> 01:17:51.220]  All that biology kicks in, and I think you get a lot greater understanding, at least if you're centered.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.001]  Okay, John in San Francisco.
[01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.882]  You're on the air.
[01:17:54.882 --> 01:17:56.183]  Alex, honored to be on the show.
[01:17:56.183 --> 01:17:57.104]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[01:17:57.104 --> 01:17:57.744]  Good to have you here.
[01:17:57.744 --> 01:17:58.484]  What's on your mind?
[01:17:58.484 --> 01:17:59.505]  Hey, what do you want to talk about first?
[01:17:59.505 --> 01:18:01.126]  I like guys from Money Masters.
[01:18:01.126 --> 01:18:02.587]  I disagree with things in both.
[01:18:03.815 --> 01:18:04.757]  Whatever you want.
[01:18:04.757 --> 01:18:07.261]  I thought you said you disagreed with me, so we're putting it ahead of the line.
[01:18:07.261 --> 01:18:07.702]  Okay, thanks.
[01:18:07.702 --> 01:18:18.099]  Alright, so on the vibe guy thing, you know, the only issue I had with you yesterday, Alex, was that you didn't address the most, you know, the thing that we kept arguing about directly, which was the scarcity principle.
[01:18:22.759 --> 01:18:23.400]  Well, I agree.
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:31.147]  Technology is going to avoid a lot of scarcity if it was allowed to be developed and distributed, and I'm all for that.
[01:18:31.147 --> 01:18:40.556]  The problem is the elite is moving with their own scientific dictatorship to create a world police state and then reduce the world population before that step towards
[01:18:41.176 --> 01:18:42.016]  The singularity.
[01:18:42.016 --> 01:18:46.518]  Singularity in energy, singularity in computing.
[01:18:46.518 --> 01:19:04.524]  So that's my whole point, is that we're in the middle of a raging battle right now, and then we've got this theosophic original view from which much of the current architecture comes from, and they're claiming the same theosophic system that they sell the low-level dreamers and well-meaning people on.
[01:19:04.524 --> 01:19:06.825]  I'm saying, hey, I've seen this before, and it's like, no, you haven't.
[01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:12.192]  Well, you know, we're not in the transhumanist period yet.
[01:19:12.192 --> 01:19:14.194]  We're still human beings.
[01:19:14.194 --> 01:19:15.395]  Scarcity is always going to be here.
[01:19:15.395 --> 01:19:17.137]  There's no way around it.
[01:19:17.137 --> 01:19:18.578]  That's the nature of reality.
[01:19:18.578 --> 01:19:23.102]  And all he was doing was giving us some rehashed Marxist utopian nonsense.
[01:19:24.239 --> 01:19:42.909]  If any of these guys, you know, spend two seconds reading, you know, some of the people that you like so much, like the Lou Rockwells and those guys, and the Mises, they'll know that, you know, pricing calculations have doomed the Soviet, Russian, Marxist empire, and it's an invaluable part of economics.
[01:19:42.909 --> 01:19:45.131]  You can't get around it.
[01:19:45.131 --> 01:19:46.831]  Well, it's also how humans are designed.
[01:19:46.831 --> 01:19:47.752]  We are competitive.
[01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:49.911]  And that can lead to very dangerous things.
[01:19:49.911 --> 01:19:51.051]  It can also lead to great things.
[01:19:51.051 --> 01:19:53.052]  Let's keep talking about it on the other side, John.
[01:19:53.052 --> 01:19:53.912]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:53.912 --> 01:19:55.973]  I want to get into the economy and fortune inoculations.
[01:19:55.973 --> 01:19:57.494]  You know, the little battles.
[01:19:57.494 --> 01:19:59.675]  The little pathetic battles I'm fighting.
[01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:03.959]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.

[01:22:54.632 --> 01:23:01.898]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:23:01.898 --> 01:23:03.640]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.322]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:23:06.322 --> 01:23:11.447]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[01:23:52.674 --> 01:23:53.894]  I was a highwayman along the coach road
[01:24:12.978 --> 01:24:36.791]  Sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five But I am still alive
[01:24:44.199 --> 01:25:09.050]  I was born upon the tide With the sea I did abide I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico I went aloft and furrowed the mainsail and up below And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
[01:25:18.192 --> 01:25:20.153]  We're good to go.
[01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:56.280]  I'll always be around, around, around, around, around, around.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.900]  I don't stop torturing people.
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:00.741]  I just love the Highwoman Ballad.
[01:26:00.741 --> 01:26:02.941]  And Willie told me that's his favorite song.
[01:26:02.941 --> 01:26:04.501]  This one right here.
[01:26:04.501 --> 01:26:09.443]  I fly a star ship across the university line.
[01:26:09.443 --> 01:26:14.024]  And when I reach the other side,
[01:26:43.081 --> 01:26:46.162]  I know we got John, Scott, Helen, Nick, James, Roger.
[01:26:46.162 --> 01:26:47.463]  I want to get to all of them.
[01:26:47.463 --> 01:26:48.843]  Rodney, I'm out of control.
[01:26:48.843 --> 01:26:49.884]  I'm out of control.
[01:26:49.884 --> 01:26:52.565]  I'd rather be sitting around listening to music.
[01:26:52.565 --> 01:26:57.266]  Finishing up with John in San Francisco, you wanted to make a point about the Money Masters.
[01:26:57.266 --> 01:27:00.027]  Yeah, well you're going to sing with Willie when he comes to Texas?
[01:27:00.027 --> 01:27:01.568]  I don't think I sing very good.
[01:27:01.568 --> 01:27:01.908]  Go ahead.
[01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:08.460]  So one quick thing too as an atheist, I have some issues with the first side guys too.
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:14.223]  I think he, just a quick point, he mixes his Christmas and Easter metaphors, you know?
[01:27:14.223 --> 01:27:17.084]  He jams them all in together with the winter solstice.
[01:27:18.268 --> 01:27:19.669]  It just seems like a mess to me.
[01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:22.232]  I think he's got some real thought problems.
[01:27:22.232 --> 01:27:32.701]  But moving on to the Money Master guys, you know, one of the things that you seem to agree with him is that we should move back to Scrip, which was the currency that we used, I guess, after the Civil War.
[01:27:33.422 --> 01:27:52.366]  We could have a debate about government-issued fiat that's controlled by the public, educated, and aware, or we could look at the Von Mies angle of gold and silver, but any of it can be manipulated because it's the nature of man that we're not inherently bad, but we inherently do have a lot of bad people, and we're bad and good.
[01:27:53.263 --> 01:28:00.628]  Yeah, I mean, the thing is, any time you get the, you know, look, the government is, everything implicit in what the government does is the gun.
[01:28:00.628 --> 01:28:08.613]  So, you know, whenever you have the government telling you what to do, forcing, you know, the money monopoly on you, there's always, it's always rife with abuse.
[01:28:08.613 --> 01:28:14.297]  People should be able to use whatever they want as a... Oh, I agree with Zeitgeist, that we can move away from what we know is current.
[01:28:14.757 --> 01:28:32.593]  Currency, and then there could be all, you know, computer systems can decide, you decide what system to subscribe to, you know, to automatically offer, you know, say different stocks or different commodities, and literally people could pay out of a stock market, but then that could be manipulated too.
[01:28:32.593 --> 01:28:40.500]  I mean, there's just so many different ways to do it, but saying we're going to just magically get rid of money and exchange chickens and pigs again, it's just not going to work.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:48.027]  Absolutely, but I do, I have to say, I don't want to be a Mises show by any stretch of the imagination, but you know, I like Ron Paul's proposal.
[01:28:48.027 --> 01:28:51.791]  His idea is let's have, you know, let's have an alternate currency.
[01:28:51.791 --> 01:28:53.153]  Let people use whatever they want.
[01:28:53.153 --> 01:28:56.456]  Let's not, you know, tax... I agree, but that's hard.
[01:28:56.516 --> 01:28:56.756]  Good to go.
[01:29:14.145 --> 01:29:17.366]  Absolutely agree, and in fact, there's no reason under the sun.
[01:29:17.366 --> 01:29:27.171]  Anybody who doesn't get the Federal Reserve argument just has to ask themselves the question, why are we giving a monopoly to a semi-private company and then have them charge us interest for that monopoly?
[01:29:27.171 --> 01:29:27.611]  I agree.
[01:29:27.611 --> 01:29:28.731]  Back to Zeitgeist real quick.
[01:29:28.731 --> 01:29:37.915]  You know, as an atheist, do you get my point that I'm saying, wait, they're the ones that are bringing up their own New Age religious stuff, so if they're going to claim they're atheists, then they can't have their cake and eat it too.
[01:29:37.915 --> 01:29:38.855]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:29:38.855 --> 01:29:39.516]  You are 100% right on that.
[01:29:40.616 --> 01:29:41.857]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:29:41.857 --> 01:29:42.858]  Oh, sure.
[01:29:42.858 --> 01:29:43.158]  Yeah.
[01:29:43.158 --> 01:29:44.759]  Hey, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:29:44.759 --> 01:29:46.180]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:46.660]  Stay with us.
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:51.563]  More Call Straight Ahead.
[01:29:51.563 --> 01:29:52.964]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.964 --> 01:29:55.465]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.465 --> 01:29:58.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.010 --> 01:30:17.180]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression, and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in, these, you know, really kind of perilous times, no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up.
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:32.370]  And she was reminded of the Great Depression and how, in those days, folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their food, but how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities, because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how, and they didn't have the chickens and the livestock.
[01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:33.851]  Not different for them.
[01:30:33.851 --> 01:30:35.772]  Well, we know one thing's certain right now.
[01:30:35.772 --> 01:30:39.714]  We're headed into much higher prices on food, and there is a global food shortage.
[01:30:39.714 --> 01:30:40.875]  Now, what can you do to prepare?
[01:30:40.875 --> 01:30:41.875]  Do what I did.
[01:30:41.875 --> 01:30:43.436]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[01:30:43.436 --> 01:30:46.238]  Go to the J. Michael Stevens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[01:30:46.238 --> 01:30:48.099]  Get some food and put it away, and be safe.
[01:30:48.099 --> 01:30:49.680]  Put a little security in your life.
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.840]  You deserve security.
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:51.861]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:30:51.861 --> 01:30:52.461]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:30:52.461 --> 01:30:52.581]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:30:52.581 --> 01:30:53.282]  Put some food away.
[01:30:53.282 --> 01:30:53.742]  Do it now.
[01:30:53.742 --> 01:30:53.802]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:08.049]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:08.049 --> 01:31:10.693]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:10.693 --> 01:31:12.235]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:12.235 --> 01:31:13.056]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:13.056 --> 01:31:13.918]  This is his MO.
[01:31:13.918 --> 01:31:15.440]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.022]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:17.402 --> 01:31:24.552]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:24.552 --> 01:31:25.033]  Some U.S.
[01:31:25.033 --> 01:31:31.401]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:31.401 --> 01:31:34.846]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:35.066 --> 01:31:45.352]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:31:45.352 --> 01:31:46.593]  Fabled enemies.

[01:31:54.098 --> 01:31:57.700]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:01.503 --> 01:32:03.504]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:32:03.504 --> 01:32:10.466]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:32:10.466 --> 01:32:18.850]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:24.572]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[01:32:26.594 --> 01:32:28.797]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[01:33:14.565 --> 01:33:24.808]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.
[01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:33.290]  I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.
[01:33:37.093 --> 01:33:59.708]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become
[01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:10.312]  Everyone I love.

[01:34:44.518 --> 01:34:45.940]  Scott in Arizona, thanks for holding.
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:48.283]  And Helen, Nick and others.
[01:34:48.283 --> 01:34:49.465]  Hey Alex, how you doing buddy?
[01:34:49.465 --> 01:34:49.685]  Good.
[01:34:52.345 --> 01:34:59.267]  The thing is, I'm kind of just upset with this stock market thing, you know, going up and down and up and down.
[01:34:59.267 --> 01:35:04.429]  I don't want a depression to come on us, not like I want that, but I just kind of want to get it over with.
[01:35:04.429 --> 01:35:09.591]  And it seems like you just keep prolonging this thing and it'll be inevitable, you know, it'll be obvious.
[01:35:09.591 --> 01:35:15.173]  And it just seems like... Well, tell me what you think is happening, what you think they're doing, or do you think they're out of control?
[01:35:16.272 --> 01:35:17.373]  Oh, I think they're out of control.
[01:35:17.373 --> 01:35:21.297]  I think they're just injecting it, and I just don't know how long they're going to keep it up for.
[01:35:21.297 --> 01:35:26.281]  I mean, when are they going to... I mean, they can keep injecting this and injecting this and, you know, until they get... They are.
[01:35:26.281 --> 01:35:27.322]  They're not going to stop, sir.
[01:35:27.322 --> 01:35:30.005]  Yeah, I know that.
[01:35:30.005 --> 01:35:41.976]  As long as the dollar has one one-hundredth of what it had, they will keep printing it and handing it in to themselves and buying real goods with it, and then foisting the debt onto our backs with their paramilitary forces.
[01:35:42.924 --> 01:35:49.451]  Because, see, by totally bankrupting us, they, through the fraudulent receivership system, then claim ownership of us.
[01:35:49.451 --> 01:35:57.180]  They run up debts in our name, take over the world with it, then claim we're pauper, indentured servitude, debtor's prison minions.
[01:35:57.180 --> 01:35:57.320]  Yeah.
[01:35:58.203 --> 01:36:04.784]  I know, I just, but I'm just saying that, how, I mean, the martial law, and we know that... They're not going to stop, ever.
[01:36:04.784 --> 01:36:24.808]  They're just going to continue pumping all the liquidity right into them, right into their own systems, until it fully collapses, and they'll remonetize under a new global government model, openly run by the private banks, controlling the UN, the armies, the global carbon taxes, the local enviro-cops, total world government through financial bankruptcy, designed by them.
[01:36:24.808 --> 01:36:25.028]  That's it.
[01:36:26.909 --> 01:36:28.089]  I agree with you.
[01:36:28.089 --> 01:36:30.391]  I'm just saying, when are they going to get to that point?
[01:36:30.391 --> 01:36:31.472]  They are not going to stop.
[01:36:31.472 --> 01:36:32.413]  They are not going to stop.
[01:36:32.413 --> 01:36:50.708]  The market is going to go up and down, and up and down, but overall down over the next few years, until it finally craters, and then they'll take the liquidity they've amassed and buy up basically everything that's left, and then it will just be a global corporate state walled off from the slave populations who wonder why everybody's dying of cancer all around them.
[01:36:51.607 --> 01:36:52.007]  That's it.
[01:36:52.007 --> 01:37:10.220]  I mean, just stumbling around, cops dying, your family's dying, still SWAT teaming us, citizens dying, diseases everywhere, radiation leaks, poison, death, eugenics, with the officers at the UN dancing around in our graves, giggling and smirking, while they sit behind the controlled compounds eating organic food and not taking any of the injections.
[01:37:11.403 --> 01:37:13.684]  Slow death instead of like another terrorist attack?
[01:37:13.684 --> 01:37:20.446]  Well, there'll be lots of those, you know, when they need them to herd us back in and, you know, teach the cops to break our skulls for our safety.
[01:37:20.446 --> 01:37:25.028]  It'll be a cocktail of it all, just social engineering by controlled freak psychopaths.
[01:37:25.028 --> 01:37:37.892]  Well, I would hope that what I'm talking about, I wish they would just, you know, there's something here that can just get the people so much against them that we could overthrow them, but I mean, if they do a slow death like that, there's just, I don't see anybody, enough people waking up that way.
[01:37:39.677 --> 01:37:40.337]  No, that's it.
[01:37:40.337 --> 01:37:42.219]  Slow death is on the menu.
[01:37:42.219 --> 01:37:45.862]  Slow, like a slow poison, kills you very slowly.
[01:37:45.862 --> 01:37:52.548]  And you know, they drug you out with drugs and culture and entertainment.
[01:37:52.548 --> 01:37:54.549]  You just lay right there and you just die.
[01:37:54.549 --> 01:37:58.853]  With a nice propaganda overlay to condition us all that it's for our best interest.
[01:37:59.594 --> 01:38:06.802]  Yeah, I'd say when they do a slow death like that, it's hard to wake people up because they just think, ah, you know, they can find things, a positive in anything.
[01:38:06.802 --> 01:38:11.187]  But when they see it, like the bank's failing, people start to wake up because they start to see it all over the TV.
[01:38:11.187 --> 01:38:11.648]  That's right.
[01:38:11.648 --> 01:38:13.249]  And they start to realize.
[01:38:13.249 --> 01:38:18.836]  But when they don't have enough of that going on and it starts to mellow out again, then I think they start getting hope again.
[01:38:19.256 --> 01:38:19.916]  And that's what I'm saying.
[01:38:19.916 --> 01:38:22.857]  If they do a slow death like that, it's going to be hard to wake people up.
[01:38:22.857 --> 01:38:23.518]  Well, exactly.
[01:38:23.518 --> 01:38:36.182]  When they release a controlled bioweapon that only kills, you know, a few hundred thousand people, then they'll teach us how to live in quarantine and lockdown, and all the movies are teaching us this, and how to be under control, and how to have hazmat teams, and, you know, they're the good guys keeping us safe from it.
[01:38:36.182 --> 01:38:38.262]  You know, it sets up those roles.
[01:38:38.262 --> 01:38:40.003]  It's all role-playing in the human mind.
[01:38:40.003 --> 01:38:42.464]  You know, Pavlovian, you know, mammalian programming.
[01:38:43.224 --> 01:38:43.804]  We're good to go.
[01:39:07.211 --> 01:39:07.851]  We're good to go.
[01:39:37.566 --> 01:39:38.507]  Yeah.
[01:39:38.507 --> 01:39:43.450]  They're products of their environment and how they've been programmed.
[01:39:43.450 --> 01:39:47.533]  But then by products of their environment, the enemy knows how to take the base programming.
[01:39:47.533 --> 01:39:55.519]  It's like humans are like buying a computer and it has all the innate software and programs that come with it, but then it's what do you add to the computer?
[01:39:55.519 --> 01:39:57.020]  What do you build into it?
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:59.261]  How do you use those programs?
[01:39:59.261 --> 01:40:02.343]  And then that's the nurture.
[01:40:02.343 --> 01:40:03.204]  That's what they bring in.
[01:40:03.204 --> 01:40:04.305]  That's how they punch the buttons.
[01:40:05.419 --> 01:40:15.445]  Yeah, because originally I thought that if they, you know, did another 9-1-1 event, that military would be breaking out all over the country and it would change the world as we, I mean... They already are!
[01:40:15.445 --> 01:40:21.028]  See, that's the sab, the mental sab of the government's the good guys, they're secret bad guys.
[01:40:21.028 --> 01:40:24.850]  Remember I said seven years ago, soon they'll say there's white Al-Qaeda everywhere?
[01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:29.954]  See, first, it's just those brown-skinned people over there, you know, using the inherent tribalism.
[01:40:29.954 --> 01:40:31.295]  It's not even racism, it's natural.
[01:40:31.295 --> 01:40:35.037]  I'm not saying it's healthy in this system, but it's normal.
[01:40:35.037 --> 01:40:38.140]  And it's just for that enemy that wears a turban and dresses different.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:46.346]  And then the whole time, the battle configuration, the attack pattern, the system was being geared up for taking your children, arresting you, seizing your house.
[01:40:46.346 --> 01:40:49.528]  The whole attack pattern was on you.
[01:40:49.528 --> 01:40:53.051]  See, every look at the propaganda, you can look at
[01:40:54.404 --> 01:40:56.145]  That's how real intelligence is gathered.
[01:40:56.145 --> 01:40:57.746]  It's what's happening on the ground.
[01:40:57.746 --> 01:40:59.828]  You can tell what the secret program is.
[01:40:59.828 --> 01:41:10.855]  That's how I can predict what their documents are going to say before they're declassified, and then it comes out and I'm exactly right, because I can see the physical manifestation of what they're doing and the integrated fields of propaganda and social engineering.
[01:41:10.855 --> 01:41:13.056]  And I can see other countries that are more ahead of us.
[01:41:13.056 --> 01:41:18.380]  I can watch other countries that are behind us in their latest download of the propaganda.
[01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:29.066]  And so by studying that as a kind of organic sociologist and historian, we're able to then integrate forward off the enemy's own battle plan and tell you exactly what's going to happen.
[01:41:30.157 --> 01:41:32.438]  Yeah, I agree with you there, Alex.
[01:41:32.438 --> 01:41:53.643]  And the thing is, you know, what I originally thought, if they had a big terrorist attack and they did martial law all across the country, if that ever happened, I thought that we'd have a chance to regroup at that point, because everybody would say, I can't stand the military on the streets, and they would realize... No, no, no, they're going to have rioting and people starving and more disasters to introduce us, just incrementally.
[01:41:53.643 --> 01:41:53.763]  Okay.
[01:41:53.763 --> 01:41:58.864]  See, they're going to have North come out with the jaws of life, you know, that big machine that cuts crushed cars open.
[01:41:59.517 --> 01:42:01.538]  I mean, they say that for PR.
[01:42:01.538 --> 01:42:02.679]  Oh, we're here to help local police.
[01:42:02.679 --> 01:42:03.179]  We're just here.
[01:42:03.179 --> 01:42:10.784]  Oh, we're here to... Well, like local police couldn't have the jaws of life, you know, but... No, no, no, the military... See, lots of PR pieces, you already see it.
[01:42:10.784 --> 01:42:21.530]  I mean, I remember nine years ago, oh, the military police from the Army and the Air Force in San Antonio are out in downtown this week for Fiesta, helping with security, and it showed them arresting someone.
[01:42:22.418 --> 01:42:23.840]  See, it's just introduced.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.601]  Oh, they're at the Kentucky Derby.
[01:42:25.601 --> 01:42:27.023]  Oh, they're at the MTV Awards.
[01:42:27.023 --> 01:42:28.504]  Oh, they're at the NFL.
[01:42:28.504 --> 01:42:29.405]  Super Bowl.
[01:42:29.405 --> 01:42:30.546]  Oh, they're at my school.
[01:42:30.546 --> 01:42:32.848]  Oh, they did a terror drill at my school.
[01:42:32.848 --> 01:42:34.010]  They didn't announce it.
[01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:35.771]  And some kids crapped their pants.
[01:42:35.771 --> 01:42:37.673]  But you know, the parents call the news.
[01:42:37.673 --> 01:42:39.075]  They pick the one parent that likes it.
[01:42:39.075 --> 01:42:40.276]  You know, it kind of scared them.
[01:42:40.276 --> 01:42:43.159]  But with Al Qaeda, I kind of think it's needed.
[01:42:43.679 --> 01:42:50.083]  Meanwhile, your children have now been trained to basically submit into a catatonic state when men run in on them on a SWAT team formation.
[01:42:50.083 --> 01:42:54.305]  It's all, the whole country, the whole world is a giant re-education camp.
[01:42:54.305 --> 01:42:55.586]  That's exactly right, yeah.
[01:42:55.586 --> 01:42:59.708]  But we need a re-education, don't we?
[01:42:59.708 --> 01:43:01.229]  God, I hate the slow death.
[01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:04.190]  I mean, they, I guess there's, that's the death.
[01:43:04.190 --> 01:43:05.251]  Creeping death!
[01:43:05.251 --> 01:43:10.754]  Creeping, soul-sucking death.
[01:43:10.754 --> 01:43:12.335]  Yeah, that's the worst kind, man.
[01:43:13.368 --> 01:43:15.029]  Take care, my friend.
[01:43:15.029 --> 01:43:17.690]  All we can do is face the horror and make preparation for it.
[01:43:17.690 --> 01:43:20.671]  I mean, people say, oh, it's negative, it's fear-mongering, it's scary.
[01:43:20.671 --> 01:43:22.092]  I mean, what is it?
[01:43:22.092 --> 01:43:25.293]  1 in 33 with cancer, now 1 in 2 with males, 1 in 3 with women.
[01:43:25.293 --> 01:43:30.355]  What is it 1 in 25, 27 years ago with autism, now 1 in 86?
[01:43:30.355 --> 01:43:31.596]  What is it?
[01:43:31.596 --> 01:43:40.300]  What is sodium deadly fluoride and other toxins in the water by design with government documents to brain damage you and cause calcification of all your major glands and bone fractures?
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:42.821]  I mean, you may not as adults care about yourself.
[01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:54.518]  Adults innately have a self-sacrifice programming once you get into the hierarchy of needs, but the enemy reprograms that and uses it against you where you don't care about yourself.
[01:43:54.518 --> 01:43:57.883]  Well, you better go ahead and care about your children.
[01:43:57.883 --> 01:43:59.264]  Look at their little eyes.
[01:43:59.264 --> 01:44:00.226]  Look at their little faces.
[01:44:03.908 --> 01:44:21.315]  You know, I try to tell young people on air, and personally, when I hear that young men and women are getting in trouble in school, I tell them, look, have you noticed that MTV and TV and the culture and the movies show it as cool to rebel, and cool to do bad things, and then they show you how you're supposed to rebel?
[01:44:21.315 --> 01:44:25.957]  With your hair, your clothes, or with tattoos, or how you talk?
[01:44:25.957 --> 01:44:27.738]  And I'm not saying any of that's a bad thing.
[01:44:27.738 --> 01:44:29.778]  I don't, it doesn't matter to me.
[01:44:29.778 --> 01:44:31.259]  I'm saying how the enemy operates.
[01:44:32.071 --> 01:44:40.559]  And then what they simultaneously tell you is cool to wear and how to talk, they show police and say this is the enemy, this is who you alert on.
[01:44:40.559 --> 01:44:52.210]  So see, you get into camouflage, which is a polo shirt, slacks, nice shoes, you act friendly, you smile, you understand you're defeating enemy operations.
[01:44:52.210 --> 01:44:55.193]  You go in that class and you act friendly and you smile and
[01:44:57.156 --> 01:45:07.481]  And all the young boys have been taught to act like gangbangers and behave like basically rhesus monkeys and so they act like that and wonder why they really don't get the women.
[01:45:07.481 --> 01:45:11.563]  See, they know mammalian programming and there's thousands of different points of it, but that's one of the key ones.
[01:45:11.563 --> 01:45:15.105]  And they teach girls, act like a little whore and then you'll get all the guys.
[01:45:15.105 --> 01:45:18.387]  And really just destroys their life and makes them unhappy and they get used up.
[01:45:20.831 --> 01:45:22.212]  Get into drugs and the rest of it.
[01:45:22.212 --> 01:45:29.897]  You know, I mean, you know, oh, you're too old to, uh, you know, oh, drugs, that's too cool, that's in the movies, or you're too young, or, you know, that's bad, don't use that.
[01:45:29.897 --> 01:45:39.963]  No, you tell them, no, that's just, uh, really dangerous stuff brought in by the government because they want to be able to catch you with it to put you in their prisons.
[01:45:39.963 --> 01:45:44.766]  And, uh, by the way, the drug dealers cut it at the low level with all sorts of poison.
[01:45:46.252 --> 01:45:53.535]  So don't ever take methamphetamine because it'll kill all your telemphysites and will give you leukemia.
[01:45:53.535 --> 01:45:55.536]  It'll kill you real fast.
[01:45:55.536 --> 01:45:59.798]  Because again, the government made all the base ingredients illegal to make it.
[01:45:59.798 --> 01:46:14.544]  So people, instead of having three or four ingredients to make clean methamphetamine, which is still bad, cause you not to sleep, destroys your nervous system over time, like Elvis, it'll kill you a hundred times, literally faster, because they have to take each subgrouping of the drug
[01:46:16.026 --> 01:46:32.055]  Each sub-ingredient, and maybe take 5, 10, 15, 20 different things to just get the base ingredients they need, and they don't properly, because they're not chemists, and not the chemists can even do it properly, it's very, take a huge factory to do it properly with all those chemicals, you know, to make the methamphetamine.
[01:46:32.055 --> 01:46:40.119]  So they're separating out all these deadly poisons in there in a bathtub while, you know, while the baby's sitting there sucking on a baggie full of methamphetamine having a heart attack.
[01:46:44.108 --> 01:46:44.989]  And globalists know that.
[01:46:44.989 --> 01:46:46.109]  They introduce a drug culture.
[01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:46.950]  They know it's a doorway.
[01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:47.550]  It spreads it.
[01:46:47.550 --> 01:46:48.371]  It's cold-blooded.
[01:46:48.371 --> 01:46:53.975]  It's to create internal division, warfare, sectarian violence, black markets to corrupt police.
[01:46:53.975 --> 01:46:55.456]  This is sociology.
[01:46:55.456 --> 01:46:56.696]  This is hardcore.
[01:46:56.696 --> 01:46:59.358]  These people are hardcore.
[01:46:59.358 --> 01:47:02.060]  They literally have 170 IQs and they're evil.
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:03.081]  They're wicked.
[01:47:03.081 --> 01:47:03.741]  They're cold-blooded.
[01:47:03.741 --> 01:47:04.341]  They're selfish.
[01:47:04.341 --> 01:47:08.324]  And they're not going to give us any quarters.
[01:47:09.907 --> 01:47:13.349]  Do not ever use methamphetamine!
[01:47:13.349 --> 01:47:23.656]  You're out having fun, you're with some, you know, you're 14, some 16-year-olds will put you in their car, you're going out to the lake.
[01:47:23.656 --> 01:47:25.397]  You want to have that rite of passage?
[01:47:25.397 --> 01:47:27.478]  Don't take it!
[01:47:27.478 --> 01:47:28.118]  And preach at them!
[01:47:28.118 --> 01:47:29.399]  Don't say, oh, it's because I'm a square.
[01:47:29.399 --> 01:47:32.281]  Say, man, that's got poison in it because it's not made properly.
[01:47:37.173 --> 01:47:48.623]  No, don't go out and drink and drive because, A, you could kill some people, but B, it's being used to totally shut down the system and destroy the Bill of Rights.
[01:47:48.623 --> 01:47:55.589]  And then parents know teenagers, you know, in the 12th grade are gonna drink, so they try to leave and let them have a party at the house, and then they get arrested and CPS'd.
[01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:56.690]  You know, there's no end to it.
[01:47:56.690 --> 01:48:01.935]  The point is, is that... Dress nice,
[01:48:03.081 --> 01:48:05.302]  Go in and say no to the forced inoculations.
[01:48:05.302 --> 01:48:07.663]  You want to be popular and cool and really mean something at school?
[01:48:07.663 --> 01:48:08.663]  You want to do something really different?
[01:48:08.663 --> 01:48:10.624]  You want to be a real rebel?
[01:48:10.624 --> 01:48:17.366]  Go hand out 500 copies at your high school of a fact sheet that there's no law to take vaccines and that they're dangerous.
[01:48:17.366 --> 01:48:31.592]  And then they're going to home you into the principal's office and they're going to tell you they're going to have you arrested and you just sit there and you act friendly with a voice recorder in your pocket and then you go out and you put that on YouTube and it's going to be national news and people are going to go to jail.
[01:48:31.592 --> 01:48:32.312]  They're going to get fired.
[01:48:34.326 --> 01:48:35.747]  You want to really be a rebel?
[01:48:35.747 --> 01:48:38.489]  Defend the Republic, defend humanity, be a true warrior.
[01:48:38.489 --> 01:48:42.453]  You're already supposed to be a warrior at 12 or 13.
[01:48:42.453 --> 01:48:44.134]  Men, women, both of you.
[01:48:44.134 --> 01:48:45.835]  You want to really change things?
[01:48:45.835 --> 01:48:47.156]  Set these bastards up.
[01:48:47.156 --> 01:48:48.357]  Bring them down.
[01:48:48.357 --> 01:48:49.959]  Show their racketeering.
[01:48:49.959 --> 01:48:54.762]  Show their criminality.
[01:48:54.762 --> 01:48:56.264]  We will invade their system.
[01:48:56.264 --> 01:48:59.046]  We will expose it at every level and we will never stop.
[01:49:00.439 --> 01:49:03.262]  Don't ever use any of their drugs.
[01:49:03.262 --> 01:49:05.884]  Don't use any of them.
[01:49:05.884 --> 01:49:12.030]  Not their Prozac, not their Ritalin, not their Valium, not their Heroin, not their Cocaine.
[01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:17.776]  I mean obviously substance use is part of human history and part of what we do.
[01:49:17.776 --> 01:49:24.021]  You can watch Blue Jays sit out and eat ripe China berries that have alcohol in them and get drunk and fall on the ground.
[01:49:24.021 --> 01:49:24.422]  It's funny.
[01:49:26.115 --> 01:49:32.740]  Uh, you know, as you get older, if you know how to do something in moderation, I don't think marijuana and a little bit of alcohol overall is a bad thing.
[01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:39.044]  The problem is it generally is very dangerous and leads into excess.
[01:49:39.044 --> 01:49:44.608]  And so that's why I don't smoke marijuana, ever.
[01:49:44.608 --> 01:49:49.572]  And I try to not drink because, for me, alcohol is not a good thing.
[01:49:49.572 --> 01:49:50.993]  There are plenty of people who can drink
[01:49:54.235 --> 01:49:56.516]  You know, one glass of wine every night with their meal.
[01:49:56.516 --> 01:49:58.897]  That is really good for you.
[01:49:58.897 --> 01:50:00.278]  Or one beer.
[01:50:00.278 --> 01:50:01.819]  Every study shows it's good.
[01:50:01.819 --> 01:50:06.561]  Me, I, um... I don't drink one beer.
[01:50:06.561 --> 01:50:07.422]  I don't drink a lot.
[01:50:07.422 --> 01:50:09.143]  I mean, last night, I just couldn't help myself.
[01:50:09.143 --> 01:50:09.903]  I bought a six-pack.
[01:50:09.903 --> 01:50:11.584]  I drank two of the beers.
[01:50:11.584 --> 01:50:12.865]  And then it made me hyper.
[01:50:12.865 --> 01:50:16.947]  That's actually why I like to drink, because a few beers will have a stimulus effect.
[01:50:16.947 --> 01:50:21.589]  And then I was up at 1 a.m., and I knew I had to get up at 6 a.m., and I'm like, I can't go to sleep because I drank those beers at 9 a.m.
[01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:22.130]  I mean, 9 p.m.
[01:50:25.447 --> 01:50:27.809]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[01:50:27.809 --> 01:50:30.330]  The point is, is that govern thyself.
[01:50:30.330 --> 01:50:32.352]  You know, get control of your mind.
[01:50:32.352 --> 01:50:33.552]  Think about how you're operating.
[01:50:33.552 --> 01:50:35.474]  Think about what you're doing.
[01:50:35.474 --> 01:50:41.037]  And for heaven's sakes, don't come to your children and tell them they can't watch violent TV because it's too adult for them.
[01:50:41.037 --> 01:50:43.059]  They want to be elders.
[01:50:43.059 --> 01:50:47.762]  Teach them that it's dangerous and programs their mind and damages their mind.
[01:50:47.762 --> 01:50:51.104]  You know, don't tell them they can't go out and party with their friends because
[01:50:52.208 --> 01:50:53.108]  You know, they're too young.
[01:50:53.108 --> 01:50:58.590]  Explain to them that this is a predatory system with criminal forces wanting to put them in prison.
[01:50:58.590 --> 01:51:01.671]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[01:51:01.671 --> 01:51:05.852]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to read?
[01:51:05.852 --> 01:51:06.972]  Of course not.
[01:51:06.972 --> 01:51:12.914]  But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and debit cards in circulation in your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing.
[01:51:13.553 --> 01:51:18.937]  I'm Walt Augustinowicz, founder of Identity Stronghold, and we think this is information you need to know.
[01:51:18.937 --> 01:51:24.141]  You may not even realize you already have one of these cards, because they look physically just like the old card.
[01:51:24.141 --> 01:51:33.988]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that makes radio communication with the card possible, right through your wallet, purse, or pants pocket without you ever removing the card.
[01:51:33.988 --> 01:51:36.890]  Pickpockets no longer even have to touch you to get your information.
[01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:42.892]  Our company realizes the privacy danger this represents, and that's why we manufacture the SecureSleeve.
[01:51:42.892 --> 01:51:49.614]  The SecureSleeve is a patent-pending card sleeve that contains a radio frequency barrier, preventing radio signals from reaching your card.
[01:51:49.614 --> 01:51:54.496]  You can get more information and purchase the SecureSleeve online at idstronghold.com.
[01:51:54.496 --> 01:51:57.697]  That's idstronghold.com, or call us at 800-610-2770.
[01:52:01.454 --> 01:52:07.178]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:52:07.178 --> 01:52:08.499]  And we knew what to do.
[01:52:08.499 --> 01:52:10.500]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:16.865]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:17.541 --> 01:52:26.424]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:26.424 --> 01:52:33.526]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:33.526 --> 01:52:36.686]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:36.686 --> 01:52:41.728]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:42.468 --> 01:52:45.550]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:52:45.550 --> 01:52:51.473]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:52:51.473 --> 01:52:54.515]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:52:54.515 --> 01:52:59.438]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:53:01.016 --> 01:53:11.581]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[01:53:11.581 --> 01:53:13.001]  Garden in a can.
[01:53:13.001 --> 01:53:17.143]  Garden in a can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[01:53:17.143 --> 01:53:19.144]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[01:53:19.144 --> 01:53:21.925]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[01:53:21.925 --> 01:53:27.508]  There are 16 large, hermetically sealed, non-hybrid, open-pollinated packets of seeds, along with detailed
[01:53:27.648 --> 01:53:27.948]  I think so.
[01:53:48.831 --> 01:53:49.593]  We're good to go.
[01:54:01.045 --> 01:54:02.086]  Federal agents!
[01:54:02.086 --> 01:54:05.067]  We are armed!
[01:54:05.067 --> 01:54:14.513]  As much as I love the man Paris, we're going to cut this music off here in a second and go to Helen in the great country of Canada.
[01:54:14.513 --> 01:54:16.014]  Hello Alex.
[01:54:16.014 --> 01:54:17.014]  Hello Helen.
[01:54:17.014 --> 01:54:17.855]  How are you?
[01:54:17.855 --> 01:54:18.395]  Good.
[01:54:18.395 --> 01:54:19.736]  I just wanted to say that
[01:54:20.996 --> 01:54:24.700]  I really know that your life purpose is what you're doing now.
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:25.881]  You just love it.
[01:54:25.881 --> 01:54:27.282]  I love your spontaneity.
[01:54:27.282 --> 01:54:29.144]  I love your passion.
[01:54:29.144 --> 01:54:35.951]  And naturally, I love your truth and for us to discover if we want to question something.
[01:54:35.951 --> 01:54:39.234]  To me, I listen to you because it gives me...
[01:54:41.525 --> 01:54:50.915]  I might as well not have finished, you know, my university, because I get more university from you and more thinking than any of my degrees or letters after my name.
[01:54:50.915 --> 01:54:55.580]  Well, I'm flattered by that, and I get more from the listeners than I really get anywhere else.
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:58.663]  All the great angles and issues you bring up in the guests we have.
[01:54:59.389 --> 01:55:01.071]  Thank you.
[01:55:01.071 --> 01:55:09.860]  You're relatively, you know, I was asked to listen to your station relatively maybe three or four months ago.
[01:55:09.860 --> 01:55:16.046]  And I, intuitively, I came home and listened to it immediately and I was hooked on.
[01:55:16.046 --> 01:55:20.270]  And you're dead on in regard to the World Order.
[01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:21.952]  You're dead on in regard to
[01:55:24.475 --> 01:55:26.216]  To finance.
[01:55:26.216 --> 01:55:30.280]  In my opinion, we shouldn't give those robbers one red cent.
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:31.461]  They've sucked us dry.
[01:55:31.461 --> 01:55:39.248]  And basically, they're so evil that they don't have much hope.
[01:55:39.248 --> 01:55:46.034]  We have to develop ourselves within to be so strong to fight them.
[01:55:46.034 --> 01:55:48.457]  And that we cannot be in fear.
[01:55:49.809 --> 01:55:54.134]  And fortunately, I was given a real gift.
[01:55:54.134 --> 01:55:56.357]  My passion was teaching as well.
[01:55:56.357 --> 01:56:01.204]  But in my 15 years of teaching, only one principal recognized my talent.
[01:56:01.829 --> 01:56:14.678]  Before I went to school, up until age seven, I had a model that modeled love, modeled caring, compassion, everything to develop consciousness and awareness.
[01:56:14.678 --> 01:56:25.206]  And as I went to school, I could see that I was shamed, and I was put down, and I was very confused and didn't know why I was a poor student.
[01:56:25.206 --> 01:56:31.150]  You know, it's a very, very sick system, and most schools bring you into the sickness of the modern culture, and it destroys the
[01:56:31.770 --> 01:56:32.171]  Innocence.
[01:56:32.171 --> 01:56:37.816]  People think of innocence as somebody who hasn't experienced things in a way.
[01:56:37.816 --> 01:56:38.737]  I don't know how to describe it.
[01:56:38.737 --> 01:56:44.183]  Innocence is more our natural self and children who are innocent are much more attuned.
[01:56:44.183 --> 01:56:46.425]  They're so innately intelligent.
[01:56:46.425 --> 01:56:47.146]  It's just magical.
[01:56:48.055 --> 01:56:49.636]  Oh, it's absolutely magical.
[01:56:49.636 --> 01:56:53.880]  When I was five years old, I looked up into the heavens.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:57:01.946]  And one day, the heavens said to me, which I, God, higher power, whatever you want to call it, and my terms today are very neutral.
[01:57:01.946 --> 01:57:03.607]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[01:57:03.607 --> 01:57:09.992]  I mean, we get caught up in terms, and that's why I'm always going to call you in regard to Zeitgeist.
[01:57:11.013 --> 01:57:12.975]  We've got about a minute and a half left, so go ahead and make your point over.
[01:57:12.975 --> 01:57:17.959]  Anyway, I looked up into the heavens and it said, one day, you are going to understand everything.
[01:57:17.959 --> 01:57:19.100]  And I put my hand up.
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:20.320]  I said, oh no, don't give me that.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:22.122]  That's too much for a little girl my age.
[01:57:22.122 --> 01:57:23.363]  And I skipped off.
[01:57:23.363 --> 01:57:26.145]  So that modeled my innocence.
[01:57:26.145 --> 01:57:28.367]  But it modeled my consciousness and my knowing.
[01:57:29.858 --> 01:57:48.971]  I remember having, I think most children have those similar events, you know, staring into the great void of the universe, you know, realizing that there's so much more around us, that we're just a tiny island, you know, in the middle of it with the sea of experiences and events and other individuals and consciousness around us.
[01:57:48.971 --> 01:57:51.413]  It's just so wonderful.
[01:57:51.413 --> 01:57:53.254]  Life is truly wonderful.
[01:57:53.254 --> 01:57:57.297]  And there's a lot of pain and a lot of bad things in the midst of it.
[01:57:58.158 --> 01:58:02.107]  But a lot of people do get hurt by the system and that's why a lot of people do turn to evil.
[01:58:02.107 --> 01:58:03.972]  They learn to revel in it.
[01:58:05.481 --> 01:58:09.744]  You know, it's all a process, and that's why we need God.
[01:58:09.744 --> 01:58:11.125]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:58:11.125 --> 01:58:13.747]  It's good hearing from you, and good to have you fitting into the show.
[01:58:13.747 --> 01:58:15.047]  Helen from Canada.
[01:58:15.047 --> 01:58:17.169]  I'm talking to Nick, James, Rodney, Russ, and others.
[01:58:17.169 --> 01:58:18.170]  We're going to get our guest on coming up.
[01:58:18.170 --> 01:58:20.371]  I'm talking about the monetary system we're seeing.
[01:58:20.371 --> 01:58:22.372]  We'll continue with phone calls as well.
[01:58:22.372 --> 01:58:27.196]  And I haven't even gotten into New Jersey parents' protest mandatory flu shots, but that headline's not really correct.
[01:58:27.196 --> 01:58:28.616]  They're not mandatory.
[01:58:28.616 --> 01:58:35.181]  They're adding that to the list that they, quote, say are compulsory to attend school, but there's no law to take it to attend school.
[01:58:35.901 --> 01:58:42.587]  They just say it's a regulation, so it's fraud.
[01:58:42.587 --> 01:58:44.008]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.008 --> 01:58:46.690]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.491 --> 01:58:58.139]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:58.139 --> 01:59:00.762]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:59:00.762 --> 01:59:02.324]  But who is the enemy?
[01:59:02.324 --> 01:59:03.105]  Bin Laden.
[01:59:03.105 --> 01:59:04.066]  This is his MO.
[01:59:04.066 --> 01:59:05.508]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:59:05.508 --> 01:59:07.090]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:59:07.470 --> 01:59:14.613]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:14.613 --> 01:59:15.093]  Some U.S.
[01:59:15.093 --> 01:59:21.456]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:21.456 --> 01:59:24.897]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:25.137 --> 01:59:35.425]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:59:35.425 --> 01:59:36.666]  Fabled enemies.

[01:59:53.772 --> 01:59:56.174]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.174 --> 02:00:05.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:06.941]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.941 --> 02:00:08.723]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.723 --> 02:00:10.464]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.464 --> 02:00:12.065]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.065 --> 02:00:13.046]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.046 --> 02:00:17.809]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.809 --> 02:00:21.912]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.559 --> 02:00:26.881]  That's right, already into hour number three.
[02:00:26.881 --> 02:00:28.923]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:00:28.923 --> 02:00:32.325]  Nick in Indiana, you're on the air, sir.
[02:00:32.325 --> 02:00:33.366]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:00:33.366 --> 02:00:34.707]  Good.
[02:00:34.707 --> 02:00:48.756]  Alright, I originally became aware of you back in the day when Waking Life came out back in, I don't know, 2001, 2002, and I've been, it's probably been later than that, but I have been a fan ever since.
[02:00:48.756 --> 02:00:49.717]  Endgame, great.
[02:00:49.717 --> 02:00:50.958]  Terror Storm, great.
[02:00:51.843 --> 02:00:59.603]  But, uh, what I wanted to call about, I guess, is not necessarily anything I disagree with you, but sort of a...
[02:01:00.347 --> 02:01:06.268]  I guess, sort of a cautionary note, maybe for some of your... Well, of course I'm a jackass!
[02:01:06.268 --> 02:01:20.731]  Of course I'm arrogant and have all... I mean, of course I probably could have done a better job in that Zeitgeist interview, but just as soon as he told me that birds are taught how to build nests, and then just took on that hoity-toity attitude... No, I told you... I mean, that makes me mad!
[02:01:20.731 --> 02:01:26.972]  And then the whole thing is the Theosophic Society, and it's word-for-word out of it, and I... I just... I'm sorry, you know?
[02:01:27.552 --> 02:01:29.493]  I told, I know, I agree with you.
[02:01:29.493 --> 02:01:31.533]  I don't believe in the conditioning thing.
[02:01:31.533 --> 02:01:34.754]  I, you know, what happened with the first human?
[02:01:34.754 --> 02:01:38.855]  Did they have to be conditioned by something else and yada yada yada?
[02:01:38.855 --> 02:01:40.176]  It just doesn't follow.
[02:01:40.176 --> 02:01:48.878]  My thing is, is, um, what I called about was sort of, I guess, what we term occult.
[02:01:48.878 --> 02:01:55.280]  Um, there definitely is a lot of negative connotation with the term occult.
[02:01:56.581 --> 02:01:58.922]  Occult just means hidden, as you know.
[02:01:58.922 --> 02:02:08.245]  Definitely hidden, but with occult practices as far as how people use the occult for different spiritual paths.
[02:02:08.245 --> 02:02:10.745]  Well, Rob Jacobson puts it well.
[02:02:10.745 --> 02:02:19.428]  Any group that's secret, any group that tells you it's esoteric and can't let you know the higher secrets, throughout history, when you get down to the bottom line, it's Lucifer they're worshipping.
[02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:25.343]  And, uh, I mean, that's what all these major groups, at the end of the day, they say, hey, Lucifer's our guy.
[02:02:25.343 --> 02:02:28.365]  We just can't tell the low-level people, they're not ready for it.
[02:02:28.365 --> 02:02:45.855]  Definitely, and I totally understand that, but there are definitely many people out there, and these might be the low-level people you're talking about, you know, the upper echelons may definitely have their own agenda, but there are plenty of good intending people out there that are
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:54.045]  Occult practitioners that use things such as ritual and... Look, most of these Christian denominations are the same thing.
[02:02:54.045 --> 02:02:56.106]  I'm not arguing with you.
[02:02:56.106 --> 02:02:57.487]  I'm not arguing with you.
[02:02:57.487 --> 02:03:00.489]  I mean, I'm not saying that... I'm not here even judging people.
[02:03:00.489 --> 02:03:02.030]  This isn't really a religious show.
[02:03:02.030 --> 02:03:03.511]  That's what I kept saying in the argument with him.
[02:03:03.511 --> 02:03:05.252]  He kept saying, that's your Christian perspective.
[02:03:05.252 --> 02:03:07.734]  And I said, hey, get that out of the way, man.
[02:03:07.734 --> 02:03:10.816]  I'm here talking about birds building nests from instinct.
[02:03:10.816 --> 02:03:11.797]  I'm talking about science.
[02:03:11.797 --> 02:03:12.637]  You're not.
[02:03:12.637 --> 02:03:14.999]  And the whole thing's a Theosophic Society angle.
[02:03:15.734 --> 02:03:21.677]  And then they're busy saying we're dumb religionists, meanwhile they're the ones being religious.
[02:03:21.677 --> 02:03:23.118]  Don't you see what I'm saying?
[02:03:23.118 --> 02:03:29.881]  No, I totally agree with you and I appreciate that you are tolerant of other people's beliefs.
[02:03:29.881 --> 02:03:40.286]  And even when it comes down to that, even when it comes down to those who worship Lucifer or whatever, there's many different ways you can take that.
[02:03:40.286 --> 02:03:45.389]  It's about people having spiritual beliefs and
[02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:55.359]  As long, and this is why I'm saying cautionary for your listeners, as long as someone is not hurting somebody else, you should be able to believe in whatever you want.
[02:03:55.359 --> 02:03:58.101]  And I'm not saying you've ever said anything to the contrary.
[02:03:58.101 --> 02:04:05.608]  I'm saying that just because you're an occult practitioner doesn't necessarily mean you're an inherently evil person.
[02:04:05.608 --> 02:04:07.149]  And I don't want your listeners to think
[02:04:07.939 --> 02:04:11.344]  They hear that someone is involved in a particular organization.
[02:04:11.344 --> 02:04:12.165]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:04:12.165 --> 02:04:20.356]  I mean, according to a Muslim, everybody else is basically an occult practitioner, and according to a Christian, everybody else is an occult practitioner.
[02:04:20.356 --> 02:04:23.921]  Everything separate from it is the bad group.
[02:04:23.921 --> 02:04:25.283]  I understand that some people get sick of
[02:04:25.743 --> 02:04:26.944]  Religion and all of this.
[02:04:26.944 --> 02:04:32.649]  My whole point is, I see Zeitgeist Addendum and it's all Theosophic Society, New World Order stuff.
[02:04:32.649 --> 02:04:37.534]  I've heard a million times before and they're claiming, no it's not, it's new and you're just a Christian so you're saying that.
[02:04:37.534 --> 02:04:39.055]  I'm like, no!
[02:04:39.055 --> 02:04:44.060]  I'm saying that from a cold-blooded stance, analyzing what they're saying.
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:51.026]  They, you know, they can't say there's no religion and you're a bunch of idiots as a way to then get all the atheists on an occultic bandwagon.
[02:04:51.026 --> 02:04:51.967]  That is deceptive.
[02:04:51.967 --> 02:04:53.188]  That is hidden.
[02:04:53.188 --> 02:04:55.370]  And that's why they call it the occult.
[02:04:55.370 --> 02:04:56.571]  Because it is hidden.
[02:04:56.571 --> 02:04:59.274]  And with true Christianity, it's all open.
[02:04:59.274 --> 02:05:00.415]  But listen, good hearing from you.
[02:05:01.289 --> 02:05:16.541]  You know, as a father and a husband, one of the enjoyable things in my life has been walking in at night and checking on my children, checking up on my wife, making sure she has the things she needs, but mostly providing for my family and knowing that they're secure, that they feel comfortable every day in their little skins.
[02:05:16.541 --> 02:05:21.084]  They don't have to worry about the oddities of the world taking over and wrecking their lives.
[02:05:21.084 --> 02:05:29.070]  I've always wanted to be a good provider, and I'm not going to change that now just because the economy's in upheaval and because there's a lot of political and social uncertainty.
[02:05:29.070 --> 02:05:29.290]  I don't
[02:05:48.293 --> 02:05:51.016]  I do hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security.

[02:07:55.150 --> 02:08:06.075]  That's 269-344-3420 today.
[02:08:06.075 --> 02:08:07.376]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.376 --> 02:08:09.137]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.137 --> 02:08:10.898]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.898 --> 02:08:12.499]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.499 --> 02:08:14.039]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.039 --> 02:08:18.222]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.222 --> 02:08:22.344]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:40.988 --> 02:08:43.349]  We are back live for the next hour and a half or so.
[02:08:43.349 --> 02:08:52.893]  We're going to have Pat Carmack on with us, one of the creators of the film, The Money Masters, the producer, and we're really honored to have him on.
[02:08:52.893 --> 02:08:58.816]  By the way, we do sell the two DVD set more than three hours.
[02:08:58.816 --> 02:09:10.201]  If you want to really understand the private Federal Reserve banking system, the history of it, then you need this film, and you need it in high quality on DVD, very affordable,
[02:09:10.928 --> 02:09:12.149]  ThatinfoWars.com.
[02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:14.551]  What, $19.95 for two discs?
[02:09:14.551 --> 02:09:20.196]  And that also supports the makers of the film, because this is everything.
[02:09:20.196 --> 02:09:27.021]  You know, money should just be an agreed-upon symbol of exchange, but instead, money has become everything.
[02:09:27.021 --> 02:09:38.711]  That's the product, and the private banks that control the issuance of it are buying up the world, and to put it simply, and we'll get his take on this, to put it simply, they have engineered the derivatives crisis, they have engineered the
[02:09:39.730 --> 02:09:40.650]  Credit crisis.
[02:09:40.650 --> 02:09:46.671]  They've cut almost all credit off to Main Street and even corporations that are mid-level.
[02:09:46.671 --> 02:10:02.675]  While an inner group of less than 10 banks is given trillions and trillions of dollars while the dollar and the euro still has some value, they're going to pass us on then the hyperinflation it brings and will claim via the government that we back the currency through our labor.
[02:10:05.576 --> 02:10:11.818]  Credit and faith, and that we then owe the taxes on these tens of trillions they are creating and giving to themselves.
[02:10:11.818 --> 02:10:13.318]  So they take it while it still has value.
[02:10:13.318 --> 02:10:14.559]  They buy real assets.
[02:10:14.559 --> 02:10:23.221]  They are getting themselves cash flush right now to be able to, as they bring in a world depression, consolidate their control.
[02:10:23.221 --> 02:10:28.543]  And as we told you many years ago, they would then propose a world government for and by, run by the private bankers.
[02:10:29.406 --> 02:10:38.468]  Where you still have your national currencies, but it's set every day by this global consortium of private banks internationally, and that you would then pay a global carbon tax.
[02:10:38.468 --> 02:10:39.188]  How do we know all this?
[02:10:39.188 --> 02:10:40.708]  They said they were going to do this.
[02:10:40.708 --> 02:10:44.169]  Pay a global carbon tax to the private banks.
[02:10:44.169 --> 02:10:45.469]  They are becoming the government.
[02:10:45.469 --> 02:10:48.890]  This isn't the government nationalizing the banks.
[02:10:48.890 --> 02:10:56.011]  This isn't the socialism, as you're hearing, which is bad enough, because it devalues the currency and makes the people
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:11:01.222]  You know, basically feed at the trough and be domesticated and bankrupt things.
[02:11:01.222 --> 02:11:04.464]  And always has corruption associated that creates more power for the elites.
[02:11:04.464 --> 02:11:12.048]  This is the corporatization, the private corporate takeover of the governmental systems of the treasuries, fully.
[02:11:12.048 --> 02:11:14.549]  They started here in 1913 and in England in 1815.
[02:11:14.549 --> 02:11:17.971]  So I want to go ahead and bring up Pat Carmack.
[02:11:17.971 --> 02:11:20.032]  He has quite a bio.
[02:11:20.032 --> 02:11:24.234]  But Pat, you're uniquely qualified to be able to speak to all of this.
[02:11:24.234 --> 02:11:26.996]  Tell folks a little bit about yourself.
[02:11:28.183 --> 02:11:30.144]  Well, good to be on the show, Alex.
[02:11:30.144 --> 02:11:32.426]  Thank you very much for having me.
[02:11:32.426 --> 02:11:34.747]  Well, my background's pretty varied.
[02:11:34.747 --> 02:11:36.829]  I was in business.
[02:11:36.829 --> 02:11:40.932]  I was a judge at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission Administrative Law.
[02:11:40.932 --> 02:11:49.277]  And I ran an oil company, a private independent company in Oklahoma that also had a utility.
[02:11:49.277 --> 02:11:52.039]  So it was an integrated energy company, a small one.
[02:11:53.107 --> 02:11:57.150]  And I've been involved in various other businesses and so forth.
[02:11:57.150 --> 02:12:01.553]  In the 1990s, I got rather involved in finance more.
[02:12:01.553 --> 02:12:08.617]  And with Bill Still, we put together the movie The Money Masters, which you've mentioned.
[02:12:08.617 --> 02:12:13.700]  And in that period, I became associated with a number of economists.
[02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:20.665]  And in doing the film, probably the most influential one was Milton Friedman, whom I consulted with.
[02:12:21.944 --> 02:12:31.672]  And since that time, I've maintained my interest in the financial sector and so forth.
[02:12:31.672 --> 02:12:38.037]  And you've got all these experts admitting from the historical documents with the congressional record the Great Depression was engineered.
[02:12:38.037 --> 02:12:43.101]  You heard my little summation of what we're seeing happen right now.
[02:12:43.101 --> 02:12:45.483]  In your expert opinion, is that accurate?
[02:12:45.483 --> 02:12:45.703]  Yes.
[02:12:47.330 --> 02:12:55.278]  And it's not a... that the Great Depression was engineered is not denied by anyone who's familiar with the deal anymore.
[02:12:55.278 --> 02:13:09.731]  I mean, it's been admitted even recently by Ben Bernanke at the University of Chicago, where he was at a birthday bash for Milton Friedman, who was still alive at that time.
[02:13:10.538 --> 02:13:13.380]  And he admitted it and Milton Friedman maintained that's what happened.
[02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:15.721]  And basically, I mean, it's very simple.
[02:13:15.721 --> 02:13:18.063]  The Fed contracted money at that time.
[02:13:18.063 --> 02:13:23.066]  Right now they're in a, you know, they're rapidly expanding the money supply.
[02:13:23.066 --> 02:13:24.107]  At least the Fed is.
[02:13:24.107 --> 02:13:26.008]  But only to themselves.
[02:13:26.008 --> 02:13:27.109]  Yeah, that's really right.
[02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:29.250]  And that's, you know, it was really interesting.
[02:13:29.250 --> 02:13:38.176]  There was an article where they were talking to a fellow at JPMorgan and they said, what are you guys going to do with the $25 billion that the Fed's going to give you?
[02:13:39.125 --> 02:13:42.489]  And he said, we really don't quite know what we're going to do with it yet.
[02:13:42.489 --> 02:13:50.617]  Well, it's kind of interesting, because JP Morgan, their profit for the last quarter was $527 million.
[02:13:50.617 --> 02:13:55.062]  And while that's down, it's still a vast amount of money.
[02:13:55.062 --> 02:14:00.688]  If you look at, you mentioned there's just several banks that control everything now, and it's all being consolidated, if you know.
[02:14:01.537 --> 02:14:06.302]  If you look at, you know, Bank of America in that same quarter had 1.18 billion profit.
[02:14:06.302 --> 02:14:09.425]  Wells Fargo had 1.6 billion.
[02:14:09.425 --> 02:14:10.806]  Citi hasn't released it yet.
[02:14:10.806 --> 02:14:16.071]  And by the way, we all know those are cooked books and you've got all the people being paid who are actually making the profits.
[02:14:16.071 --> 02:14:22.357]  So those, it's like Hollywood, you know, a movie that makes $300 million that costs $100 million, they always say it lost money.
[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:24.322]  That's right.
[02:14:24.322 --> 02:14:36.297]  Well, in that 90-day period of three major banks, their profit that they've admitted was $3.3 billion, which is $36 million a day.
[02:14:36.297 --> 02:14:38.140]  And we're bailing them out.
[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:38.921]  The taxpayers
[02:14:40.130 --> 02:14:46.935]  Taxes are being handed over to these banks to basically to do with what they will when they have that kind of bash.
[02:14:46.935 --> 02:14:53.480]  Yeah, how amazing was that to have secret meetings where Paulson is even handing money to his own former brokerage firm Goldman Sachs.
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:56.402]  I mean, just on the face, bank robbery.
[02:14:56.402 --> 02:15:00.445]  Yeah, it's obviously there's tremendous conflict of interest there.
[02:15:00.445 --> 02:15:05.368]  And this is, it's a huge, it's a bailout's really the wrong word for it.
[02:15:05.368 --> 02:15:07.510]  I mean, these banks didn't need to be bailed out.
[02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:15.094]  As you know, they have taken over recently Merrill Lynch and Wachovia.
[02:15:15.094 --> 02:15:25.021]  That's right, they've used government regulation to force deals with other institutions and as Businessweek said this week, this is actually a great consolidation and this is a bumper crop for them.
[02:15:25.021 --> 02:15:28.884]  Oh yeah, if you're in one of these four or five major banks,
[02:15:30.527 --> 02:15:34.628]  This is the golden opportunity that you've been waiting for.
[02:15:34.628 --> 02:15:37.869]  This happens, but historically this is nothing new.
[02:15:37.869 --> 02:15:45.851]  Every time there's a major economic crisis, some of the smaller banks get in trouble, and the larger ones swallow them up.
[02:15:45.851 --> 02:15:46.731]  Here we have the U.S.
[02:15:46.731 --> 02:15:49.392]  government helping fund this consolidation.
[02:15:49.392 --> 02:15:50.372]  Exactly!
[02:15:50.372 --> 02:15:51.573]  So let's go back.
[02:15:51.573 --> 02:15:53.333]  We've got you for an hour and 20 minutes or so.
[02:15:53.333 --> 02:15:54.533]  Let's go through this.
[02:15:54.533 --> 02:15:56.614]  Let's look at the depression first that you cover so well.
[02:15:57.529 --> 02:16:00.071]  Well, this is similar in a lot of ways.
[02:16:00.071 --> 02:16:04.414]  You know, the banks are in control of credit, obviously, and so if they do something like, for instance, start calling in loans
[02:16:21.147 --> 02:16:28.494]  Then the people they call the loans in from have to sell something in order to pay the loans early, and most notes allow banks to call them in early.
[02:16:28.494 --> 02:16:42.869]  This can also happen on the stock market with what are called margin calls, where the banks have loaned money to their investors who want to speculate on the stock market, and the percentages vary, but let's use 25% for now.
[02:16:45.512 --> 02:17:02.569]  If the investor only has to put up 25% of the money, and the brokerage house is providing 75%, and the brokerage house increases that arbitrarily, in which they're doing now, and have done, then the investor suddenly has to come up with the money.
[02:17:02.569 --> 02:17:04.030]  Well, typically, how do they do that?
[02:17:04.030 --> 02:17:05.551]  Because they've borrowed money.
[02:17:07.671 --> 02:17:08.651]  That's right.
[02:17:08.651 --> 02:17:10.392]  Meanwhile, this is key, folks, if you missed it.
[02:17:10.392 --> 02:17:12.012]  They're claiming they're trying to keep the market up.
[02:17:28.603 --> 02:17:37.613]  When in reality, they're actually driving it down, and then with the money they get from people dumping stock, they come back in with the bailout money and buy it back up for themselves.
[02:17:37.613 --> 02:17:39.315]  Yeah, because they're not really panicked.
[02:17:39.315 --> 02:17:42.819]  These major banks have been through this repeatedly.
[02:17:42.819 --> 02:17:45.462]  You know, there's a debate.
[02:17:45.462 --> 02:17:49.046]  Do they initiate the critical
[02:17:49.767 --> 02:18:02.104]  Catalysts that cause the downfall, or are they simply aware of it much faster than anyone else and then take the appropriate steps, which they're also much more familiar with than ordinary folks.
[02:18:02.104 --> 02:18:03.325]  And it really doesn't matter.
[02:18:03.325 --> 02:18:05.829]  The point is they hugely profit.
[02:18:06.736 --> 02:18:11.581]  From it, because either they engineer it or they're the first to know of it.
[02:18:11.581 --> 02:18:12.963]  But it's a revolving door.
[02:18:12.963 --> 02:18:20.590]  I mean, the guys running the bailout now and getting the money are the ones that change the different acts in the 90s to be able to do this.
[02:18:20.590 --> 02:18:22.072]  Of course, that's exactly right.
[02:18:22.072 --> 02:18:27.277]  I mean, right now, one of the big beneficiaries indirectly is Goldman Sachs, and of course,
[02:18:29.143 --> 02:18:37.046]  Paulson was from there, Bernanke's from there, you know, it's just, it's a Wall Street crowd that's, you know, frankly, it's very incestuous.
[02:18:37.046 --> 02:18:40.787]  They're just, you know, it's, as you mentioned, a revolving door relationship.
[02:18:40.787 --> 02:18:45.569]  They go into government, back to the banks and the government, and make huge amounts.
[02:18:45.569 --> 02:18:54.513]  You know, it's interesting, but the 50 highest private investment fund managers on Wall Street averaged $588 million in annual compensation.
[02:19:00.512 --> 02:19:06.675]  In 2007, that's 19,000 times the average worker's pay in America.
[02:19:06.675 --> 02:19:15.798]  If you want to look at another couple, that gives you some idea of the interplay between government and Wall Street.
[02:19:15.798 --> 02:19:21.801]  Was the head of AIG or was the other one who made $3 billion in five years?
[02:19:21.801 --> 02:19:23.101]  I didn't see that statistic.
[02:19:23.101 --> 02:19:23.481]  I don't know.
[02:19:23.481 --> 02:19:24.241]  No, it was on the news.
[02:19:24.241 --> 02:19:24.842]  I forget which one.
[02:19:24.842 --> 02:19:25.462]  $3 billion, yeah.
[02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:31.094]  Well, the 1% richest slice of the U.S.
[02:19:31.094 --> 02:19:34.338]  population now owns more than the bottom 95%.
[02:19:37.819 --> 02:19:53.572]  Well, let's break down, sir, where you see this going, from your unique perspective, being a judge on financial matters, and then also, of course, running a bank, running an oil company, and a filmmaker, as well, the producer of The Money Masters.
[02:19:53.572 --> 02:19:56.355]  We'll be right back with our guest, Pat Carmack.
[02:19:56.355 --> 02:19:57.516]  Really pleased to have him with us.
[02:20:06.723 --> 02:20:09.726]  What will you do when it happens?
[02:20:09.726 --> 02:20:14.651]  When you turn to your loved ones, will you see starvation and fear?
[02:20:14.651 --> 02:20:21.017]  Or confidence because you knew what was coming and got prepared with PatriotFood.com?
[02:20:21.017 --> 02:20:22.899]  The signs are everywhere.
[02:20:22.899 --> 02:20:24.921]  You have no excuses.
[02:20:24.921 --> 02:20:29.125]  Your indifference today will determine the magnitude of your suffering tomorrow.
[02:20:29.865 --> 02:20:35.288]  What good is it to know the truth about any conspiracy unless you take action?
[02:20:35.288 --> 02:20:40.891]  Patriotfood.com has 100 pounds of dry food supplies for just $3 a pound.
[02:20:40.891 --> 02:20:44.913]  At Patriotfood.com, you'll get 20 survival foods.
[02:20:44.913 --> 02:20:51.457]  Varieties like dried tomatoes, wild rice blend, beef base, granola, vegetable mix, and much more.
[02:20:51.457 --> 02:20:54.178]  There are just two kinds of people.
[02:20:54.178 --> 02:20:56.179]  Slave and free.
[02:20:56.179 --> 02:20:57.220]  Be ready.
[02:20:57.220 --> 02:20:57.820]  Be free.
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:00.602]  With PatriotFood.com.
[02:21:00.602 --> 02:21:04.625]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[02:21:04.625 --> 02:21:08.108]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:08.108 --> 02:21:10.751]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:10.751 --> 02:21:12.312]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:12.312 --> 02:21:13.092]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:13.092 --> 02:21:14.053]  This is his M.O.s.
[02:21:14.053 --> 02:21:14.954]  We have to look to the media.
[02:21:14.994 --> 02:21:15.194]  Some U.S.
[02:21:15.194 --> 02:21:18.216]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:31.444 --> 02:21:34.927]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:34.927 --> 02:21:36.908]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:22:01.089 --> 02:22:02.851]  The economy is collapsing all around us.
[02:22:02.851 --> 02:22:03.711]  Banks are closing.
[02:22:03.711 --> 02:22:08.496]  The Federal Reserve continues to pump billions of dollars into the system to try to stop the bleeding.
[02:22:08.496 --> 02:22:10.077]  Know who is to blame.
[02:22:10.077 --> 02:22:12.139]  The Federal Reserve System.
[02:22:12.139 --> 02:22:14.582]  On November 22nd, the end begins.
[02:22:14.582 --> 02:22:15.903]  Every Federal Reserve Bank.
[02:22:15.903 --> 02:22:17.104]  Every Federal Reserve Office.
[02:22:17.104 --> 02:22:18.285]  38 cities.
[02:22:18.285 --> 02:22:19.126]  One purpose.
[02:22:19.126 --> 02:22:19.747]  End the Fed.
[02:22:20.367 --> 02:22:22.929]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:22:22.929 --> 02:22:24.649]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:22:24.649 --> 02:22:26.531]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:44.181]  It is liquid.
[02:22:44.181 --> 02:22:45.561]  It is private.
[02:22:45.561 --> 02:22:46.382]  It owes no one.
[02:22:46.382 --> 02:22:48.103]  It cannot go bankrupt.
[02:22:48.103 --> 02:22:50.124]  And it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:22:50.124 --> 02:22:52.225]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:22:52.225 --> 02:22:52.505]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[02:23:01.139 --> 02:23:01.460]  I'm good.
[02:23:18.558 --> 02:23:18.978]  I think so.

[02:24:30.799 --> 02:24:43.589]  Pat Carmack, please continue with where you see this going, how you see this unfolding.
[02:24:46.185 --> 02:24:49.947]  Other people have better crystal balls, and I'd prefer to refer to them.
[02:24:49.947 --> 02:24:54.069]  One of them was Carol Quigley, who was a professor at Georgetown.
[02:24:54.069 --> 02:24:59.652]  He's a macro-historian, and he taught a lot of our Foreign Service folks.
[02:24:59.652 --> 02:25:02.533]  He wrote a book called Tragedy and Hope, A History of the World in Our Time.
[02:25:05.542 --> 02:25:07.903]  This is the book given to the Foreign Service.
[02:25:07.903 --> 02:25:16.087]  The internal type book was public, but an inside baseball on how things really run, and it's everything we say here.
[02:25:16.087 --> 02:25:20.129]  Yeah, and one of the key quotes in it is this one.
[02:25:20.129 --> 02:25:20.549]  It's brief.
[02:25:22.490 --> 02:25:37.657]  Professor Quigley wrote, the powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching plan, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands, able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole.
[02:25:37.657 --> 02:25:44.681]  Their secret is that they have annexed from governments, monarchies, and republics the power to create the world's money.
[02:25:45.586 --> 02:25:51.910]  So, I mean, ultimately what this is, that's the end of the quote, ultimately what this is, it's a world power grab.
[02:25:51.910 --> 02:26:05.200]  Now, you know, there's some discussion about how bad will this get and so forth, and I don't know the answer to that, but historically, you know, there's been a gradual process since 1913.
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:07.121]  There's been peaks in it like the Great Depression.
[02:26:08.387 --> 02:26:17.010]  And certain periods after World War II where inflation was higher, where the wealth consolidation was accelerated.
[02:26:17.010 --> 02:26:33.594]  But basically it's been a non-stop concentration of wealth for nearly 100 years now, which has driven Americans from being independently productive individuals who own their own farms and small businesses to being in debt up to their eyeballs.
[02:26:33.594 --> 02:26:36.395]  And of course when that happens, when you're in debt to someone else,
[02:26:38.299 --> 02:26:51.484]  Then, as Aristotle and Aquinas and others have pointed out, the ones of virtue is tested because it's very hard to stand up to people that you owe money to and who can fire you.
[02:26:51.484 --> 02:26:53.905]  And so they take control of the country.
[02:26:53.905 --> 02:27:02.969]  And then you can't afford private education and so it's public education, which is there to get your children into the prison system, dumb them down, put them on drugs, legal and illegal.
[02:27:02.969 --> 02:27:06.270]  I mean, it's just a huge social engineering nightmare and it's all stated publicly.
[02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:13.673]  Yeah, if you take a population and educate them well, they're not going to stand for this kind of thing.
[02:27:13.673 --> 02:27:18.756]  So there's been a gradual, as you put it, dumbing down of the American population.
[02:27:18.756 --> 02:27:22.137]  In one of the areas, they've succeeded almost totally in economics.
[02:27:22.137 --> 02:27:29.881]  Most Americans understand very, very little of it, so they don't understand the mechanism whereby they're being made into debt slaves.
[02:27:30.881 --> 02:27:36.146]  And so, you know, right now over 90% of Americans have no net wealth.
[02:27:36.146 --> 02:27:39.289]  If they paid their debts, they'd have nothing left at all.
[02:27:39.289 --> 02:27:43.673]  And most of them, of course, would still have debt even if they sold everything they had.
[02:27:43.673 --> 02:27:47.296]  And for those of us that have saved, they're just going to hyperinflate everything.
[02:27:47.296 --> 02:27:52.060]  When they took the currency, they hyperinflated and again bought real things when it still had worth.
[02:27:52.060 --> 02:27:54.563]  And then they leave us with all the debt and then claim we have to pay it all back.
[02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:58.695]  Well, that's right, and that's happening worldwide, of course.
[02:27:58.695 --> 02:28:02.500]  And so this process isn't restricted to the United States.
[02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:09.370]  The fractional reserve banking system set up by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 here, it was replicated.
[02:28:10.901 --> 02:28:12.121]  In all around the world.
[02:28:12.121 --> 02:28:14.422]  We weren't the first to have it as you mentioned.
[02:28:14.422 --> 02:28:26.444]  The first nation that was really yoked to a privately owned central bank was England right after the glorious revolution in 1694.
[02:28:26.444 --> 02:28:27.924]  But that spread all around.
[02:28:27.924 --> 02:28:34.866]  And then we saw what happened when a private banking cartel with its own intelligence agency got control of a powerful seafaring empire.
[02:28:34.866 --> 02:28:35.286]  Look out!
[02:28:36.441 --> 02:28:37.482]  That's right.
[02:28:37.482 --> 02:28:47.771]  And what you have now is, this is the vehicle, this debt enslavement that's being used to control the world.
[02:28:47.771 --> 02:28:59.362]  And most of the wars and other major political events that happen have to do with extending or protecting this regime, this monetary regime.
[02:29:01.482 --> 02:29:06.064]  We're going to come back with a long segment and then later we're going to take calls at 1-800-25-99231.
[02:29:06.064 --> 02:29:12.828]  But there's so much to talk about in the width and breadth of this, but bottom line, this is the key information.
[02:29:12.828 --> 02:29:14.789]  I mean, this is what makes the world go around.
[02:29:14.789 --> 02:29:17.150]  This is who's dominating, controlling things.
[02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:18.191]  And these guys are masters.
[02:29:18.191 --> 02:29:22.833]  They're using their controlled corporate media they own to claim, oh see, this is the free market.
[02:29:22.833 --> 02:29:27.916]  See, only socialism will save you now, but socialism will further consolidate the middle class wealth
[02:29:28.656 --> 02:29:36.104]  And then it's taken up to a higher level when then it goes from being socialism into fascism being handed directly to the bankers.
[02:29:36.104 --> 02:29:42.129]  So just any of your... I mean there's so much you probably want to get into and angles you want to talk about.
[02:29:42.129 --> 02:29:44.352]  So we'll go wherever you'd like.
[02:29:44.352 --> 02:29:46.033]  We'll have a side with Pat Carmack.
[02:29:46.033 --> 02:29:49.216]  I've got a lot of questions too, but I want to hear what he thinks is most important.
[02:29:49.216 --> 02:29:49.597]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.537 --> 02:29:55.479]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.479 --> 02:30:01.441]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.441 --> 02:30:06.324]  Phase one of the insiders plan for a one world government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[02:30:06.324 --> 02:30:13.807]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior.
[02:30:13.807 --> 02:30:15.428]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[02:30:15.428 --> 02:30:16.408]  Their next engineered crisis
[02:30:16.408 --> 02:30:16.968]  I'm good.
[02:30:35.077 --> 02:30:35.818]  We're good to go.
[02:31:07.176 --> 02:31:08.277]  It was an inside job!
[02:31:08.277 --> 02:31:09.817]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:31:09.817 --> 02:31:11.538]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:31:11.538 --> 02:31:18.962]  How do the American people know that 9-11 wasn't staged, wasn't engineered by you, David Boccapella, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:31:18.962 --> 02:31:27.747]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door!
[02:31:27.747 --> 02:31:32.530]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:31:40.044 --> 02:31:40.464]  9-11!
[02:31:40.464 --> 02:31:43.905]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:31:43.905 --> 02:31:46.246]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:31:46.246 --> 02:31:52.247]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[02:31:52.247 --> 02:31:53.267]  Truth Rising.

[02:33:21.323 --> 02:33:26.345]  Carmack, producer of The Money Masters, available at Infowars.com for $19.95.
[02:33:26.345 --> 02:33:31.606]  Three and a half hours long, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:31.606 --> 02:33:33.467]  And believe me, you can't put it down.
[02:33:33.467 --> 02:33:39.249]  We aired this in 1997, probably a hundred times on AXS TV in Austin.
[02:33:39.249 --> 02:33:41.349]  It woke up so many people.
[02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:47.351]  They aired it so much because of requests that the big three-quarter inch tapes wore out, I think, three or four times.
[02:33:47.351 --> 02:33:49.692]  And I would go up there with the VHS copy of it,
[02:33:50.484 --> 02:33:53.986]  With my eyes watering at, you know, 3 a.m.
[02:33:53.986 --> 02:34:00.749]  with the edit studio and would dump it back on three-quarter inch and just turn it in to get people to see it.
[02:34:00.749 --> 02:34:03.631]  I mean, that's how important this film is.
[02:34:03.631 --> 02:34:07.233]  That's back in the trenches, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:07.233 --> 02:34:17.178]  And it's so important that people see this and understand this because this is the single best film that gives you the real history
[02:34:18.346 --> 02:34:24.390]  The last couple hundred years, what happened in the depression, and what's happening now currently, this is the enemy!
[02:34:24.390 --> 02:34:31.374]  Not Al Qaeda, not the Easter Bunny, not the Shah of Iran, you know, not whatever new thing they make up.
[02:34:31.374 --> 02:34:37.178]  This is the institution, the families, that literally have money to burn.
[02:34:37.178 --> 02:34:43.622]  They just make it out of nothing, and then make us pay interest on it, and they buy armies, they buy CPS, they buy corrupt cops,
[02:34:44.457 --> 02:34:45.918]  They literally run it all.
[02:34:45.918 --> 02:34:49.821]  They control the narcotics, importation, all of it.
[02:34:49.821 --> 02:34:53.664]  So please go to InfoWars.com and get the Money Masters on DVD today.
[02:34:53.664 --> 02:34:58.307]  Even if you know all about this, your neighbors, your friends, your family, they don't know.
[02:34:58.307 --> 02:35:05.312]  And the toll-free number to call and get a copy of the Money Masters is 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:35:12.682 --> 02:35:15.565]  You know, have the locals over.
[02:35:15.565 --> 02:35:17.726]  Show to the local library.
[02:35:17.726 --> 02:35:18.487]  Give it to people.
[02:35:18.487 --> 02:35:20.509]  I mean, it's important.
[02:35:20.509 --> 02:35:24.112]  888-253-3139 or infowars.com.
[02:35:24.112 --> 02:35:28.215]  You can also get a copy at themoneymasters.com directly from the source.
[02:35:28.215 --> 02:35:32.739]  But while you're at Infowars, you can also get Endgame, Terror Storm, Fabled Enemy, some of our films.
[02:35:32.739 --> 02:35:34.961]  And get those discounted when you get it with the Money Masters.
[02:35:34.961 --> 02:35:36.703]  It's already discounted, by the way.
[02:35:36.703 --> 02:35:38.644]  I just want you to see it.
[02:35:38.644 --> 02:35:40.166]  Same reason I went down to AXS TV.
[02:35:41.832 --> 02:35:47.993]  And I know it was aired all over AXS TV at the time.
[02:35:47.993 --> 02:35:55.614]  Were you ever aware, because I was Pat, I just don't know if you were, of how big your film was on AXS TV still today?
[02:35:55.614 --> 02:36:01.176]  Well, no, in the past I just heard of it here and there, but I wasn't aware.
[02:36:01.176 --> 02:36:05.896]  I've since found out that it was being shown all over the place.
[02:36:05.896 --> 02:36:09.157]  We're getting several requests daily at our website.
[02:36:10.253 --> 02:36:13.786]  For permission to do a public broadcast and we do allow it.
[02:36:16.212 --> 02:36:22.115]  Yeah, well back then, I mean, I didn't wait for orders from headquarters.
[02:36:22.115 --> 02:36:31.400]  I was just getting it on, you know, and, you know, just getting it out to people because, I mean, I was airing lots of documentaries, but I'm glad you guys let people do that.
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:36.642]  You obviously have to have some conditions or people will then claim that it's theirs and you'll lose control of the film.
[02:36:36.642 --> 02:36:39.744]  Well, that, and also we lose control of content if we can't
[02:36:40.664 --> 02:36:45.546]  Tell who's doing it and when they're doing it, because people could edit it and alter the message.
[02:36:45.546 --> 02:36:51.528]  So it's very important to us that we, you know, that frankly the bankers don't do that.
[02:36:51.528 --> 02:36:56.770]  Yeah, well that's my biggest problem is people take my films and they include it in their films.
[02:36:56.770 --> 02:36:57.291]  Right.
[02:36:57.291 --> 02:37:00.312]  And then I get people saying, how dare you steal this idea from Billy Bob?
[02:37:01.033 --> 02:37:09.938]  I mean, I can march up to a Bilderberg meeting and say the answer to 1984 is 1776 and then young kids will say, you stole that from another kid, I just saw Bullhorning that.
[02:37:09.938 --> 02:37:14.020]  No, they got that from me and I don't care, that's great!
[02:37:14.020 --> 02:37:21.483]  Or people take my films and use clips in their films and then people don't agree with the message of the other film my stuff's in and then people hate me because of it.
[02:37:21.483 --> 02:37:26.326]  Exactly, so it is important to maintain ownership control and we have done that.
[02:37:27.166 --> 02:37:40.929]  But, nevertheless, it's being shown all over the country now, on public access channels, on college campuses, and so forth, because people obviously are suffering now, economically, and they want to understand the system.
[02:37:40.929 --> 02:37:44.190]  And that's wonderful, because they realize they don't understand it.
[02:37:44.190 --> 02:37:50.732]  And you predicted everything that is now happening in the film, and so it's like fine wine, it gets even better with age.
[02:37:50.732 --> 02:37:52.412]  Okay, sir, what is most important?
[02:37:52.412 --> 02:37:53.253]  What do you want to get into?
[02:37:53.253 --> 02:37:55.013]  Because I've got to ask questions all day and interrupt all day.
[02:37:56.013 --> 02:37:58.174]  Well, you know, of course, two things have happened lately.
[02:37:58.174 --> 02:38:04.277]  One, besides the crisis itself, one is the bailout.
[02:38:04.277 --> 02:38:06.998]  And I want to discuss that just a little bit.
[02:38:06.998 --> 02:38:08.399]  We have a little bit.
[02:38:08.399 --> 02:38:17.363]  You know, you summarized it well, I think, and that is that, you know, it's taxpayer money, in a sense.
[02:38:17.363 --> 02:38:18.424]  In another sense, it's not.
[02:38:18.424 --> 02:38:19.304]  They're creating it.
[02:38:19.304 --> 02:38:24.647]  I mean, the Fed's creating a lot of this money now, but taxpayers will ultimately have to pay the bill for it.
[02:38:25.545 --> 02:38:28.506]  And it's being given to not the poor.
[02:38:28.506 --> 02:38:40.848]  They're not going out and handing $25 billion out in the slums of the United States, or to people being foreclosed on, or people who have lost their jobs, or anybody that really needs it.
[02:38:40.848 --> 02:38:44.369]  They're handing it to fabulously wealthy corporations.
[02:38:44.369 --> 02:38:46.169]  Now, that's obscene.
[02:38:46.169 --> 02:38:52.110]  And that was engineered by people who came from these same banks who are working for our government.
[02:38:52.110 --> 02:38:54.811]  Unfortunately, neither presidential candidate
[02:38:55.606 --> 02:38:57.187]  They're also bought and paid for.
[02:39:09.664 --> 02:39:15.907]  And, you know, obviously if they were to really promote some kind of reform, their money would begin to dry up.
[02:39:15.907 --> 02:39:17.947]  Opposition would start getting more money.
[02:39:17.947 --> 02:39:19.228]  So they both play the game.
[02:39:19.228 --> 02:39:22.289]  How much they understand it, I don't know.
[02:39:22.289 --> 02:39:29.131]  But from their public utterances, one would have to assume they're utterly ignorant of this whole problem and what the cures are.
[02:39:29.131 --> 02:39:32.473]  Since they're both intelligent men, that's rather hard to believe.
[02:39:32.473 --> 02:39:36.174]  Ron Paul understands it, but of course he didn't win the Republican nomination.
[02:39:39.068 --> 02:39:43.729]  So we don't have a prominent political leader at this time that we can turn to.
[02:39:43.729 --> 02:39:54.672]  You know, the closest we have at the moment is some of the third-party presidential candidates who, you know, unfortunately are in single digits in the polls.
[02:39:54.672 --> 02:40:01.914]  So we really just don't have a prominent leader at the moment, you know, like they did in the Great Depression.
[02:40:01.914 --> 02:40:02.894]  In the Great Depression,
[02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:08.122]  Of course, people are suffering more than we are at this point.
[02:40:08.122 --> 02:40:08.742]  Not everybody.
[02:40:08.742 --> 02:40:12.344]  I mean, some people are suffering right now just as much as others did back then, obviously.
[02:40:12.344 --> 02:40:20.188]  But overall, we're not to the same depth of a depression that they were, say, in 1930 to 1933.
[02:40:20.188 --> 02:40:22.809]  But they had political leaders rise at that time, so we will.
[02:40:22.809 --> 02:40:26.131]  And it's important that the people know what solutions
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:27.320]  I think so.
[02:40:43.433 --> 02:40:49.815]  There's another, I did want to mention too, what degree of consolidation have we reached now?
[02:40:49.815 --> 02:41:00.858]  When Citicorp takes over Merrill Lynch, and JP Morgan takes over Wah Moon, Bear Stearns, and Wells Fargo takes over Wachovia.
[02:41:00.858 --> 02:41:05.220]  Well, here's their assets now, approximately.
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:08.921]  Citigroup now has assets of approximately $3.1 trillion.
[02:41:08.921 --> 02:41:09.281]  JP Morgan,
[02:41:14.038 --> 02:41:19.041]  Uh, is now in excess of $2 trillion.
[02:41:19.041 --> 02:41:20.742]  Bank of America, $1.7 trillion.
[02:41:20.742 --> 02:41:25.524]  Uh, Wells Fargo, $1.4 trillion.
[02:41:25.524 --> 02:41:37.070]  Collectively, they control over $8 trillion in assets, which is basically, I'd say, it's fair to say it's the completion of the consolidation of, uh,
[02:41:38.419 --> 02:41:45.502]  The process that was begun back in 1913, when there were, as I recall, approximately 20,000 banks back then.
[02:41:45.502 --> 02:41:52.086]  And no one bank had anything remotely like this kind of dominant power among all those banks.
[02:41:52.086 --> 02:41:54.347]  That was the beginning of the consolidation.
[02:41:54.347 --> 02:42:02.791]  We've now reached the point where these four banks now control over $8 trillion.
[02:42:02.791 --> 02:42:05.552]  If you realize that the total loans in the economy
[02:42:08.021 --> 02:42:12.545]  Commercial bank loans are only about $10 trillion.
[02:42:12.545 --> 02:42:20.873]  A lot of people don't know this, but the Federal Reserve is in fact a stock corporation.
[02:42:20.873 --> 02:42:26.458]  The stock is owned in each of the 12 branch banks by the banks.
[02:42:27.581 --> 02:42:30.442]  There are members of the Federal Reserve System in that region.
[02:42:30.442 --> 02:42:40.025]  So, for instance, there's a Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas, and the banks in that region that belong to the Federal Reserve System own the stock of that bank, and they appoint six of the nine directors.
[02:42:40.025 --> 02:42:42.606]  But that's closed stock for those who don't know.
[02:42:42.606 --> 02:42:50.688]  I can't waddle down and buy stock specifically in that inner, you know, held corporate stock versus the stock of the bank itself.
[02:42:50.688 --> 02:42:52.949]  That's the public stock.
[02:42:52.949 --> 02:42:53.149]  Right.
[02:42:55.166 --> 02:43:03.150]  So the local banks control it, and it's based on their net capital.
[02:43:03.150 --> 02:43:12.395]  So these major banks now control the majority stock of the Federal Reserve System nationwide.
[02:43:12.395 --> 02:43:16.677]  So you have four banks that control the Federal Reserve System.
[02:43:16.677 --> 02:43:20.619]  Now, it's true that the Federal Reserve has quasi-governmental things, like the President
[02:43:21.704 --> 02:43:28.166]  Nominates and the Senate has to approve the seven, you know, governors of the Federal Reserve Board.
[02:43:28.166 --> 02:43:31.447]  But they serve 14-year terms.
[02:43:31.447 --> 02:43:34.848]  Only one every two years is nominated by the president.
[02:43:34.848 --> 02:43:43.671]  And if in a four-year term he could only change two of them if he wanted to and were successful in doing that, which would be very difficult for a president to do because they control the media and they'd go after him.
[02:43:44.998 --> 02:43:57.282]  If he were able to be president and get re-elected, having done so, which would be unlikely, in an eight-year term, since they have 14-year terms, he could only replace four of them.
[02:43:57.282 --> 02:44:03.864]  And, of course, that would be at the very end of his eight years, which it's unlikely he would succeed in doing that.
[02:44:03.864 --> 02:44:11.026]  So, basically, it's an independent body of bankers controlling our national economy for the benefit of bankers.
[02:44:11.026 --> 02:44:14.467]  I don't think anyone could reasonably say that giving these banks
[02:44:15.899 --> 02:44:23.302]  The billions of dollars, instead of giving it to the poor or people being foreclosed on or unemployed or so on, is just.
[02:44:23.302 --> 02:44:24.622]  It's simply unjust.
[02:44:24.622 --> 02:44:31.004]  This is a profoundly unjust system and it's concentrating wealth very, very rapidly now.
[02:44:31.004 --> 02:44:32.525]  It's an exponential process.
[02:44:32.525 --> 02:44:33.805]  It only gets faster.
[02:44:34.665 --> 02:44:58.977]  We're talking to Pat Carmack, the producer of the definitive film on the global banking cartel that is the New World Order, is the crime syndicate, are the people that hired the social workers and the sociologists and all the horrible things that are happening are stated in their own public documents, that it's destroying the family, destroying society, making us pauper slaves, world population reduction, theosophy, I mean all of it.
[02:44:58.977 --> 02:45:00.258]  They're here, they rule, and they're
[02:45:00.838 --> 02:45:06.621]  They're not backing off the huge consolidation we're witnessing right now.
[02:45:06.621 --> 02:45:17.588]  And again, if they were going to take trillions of dollars and dump it on the public, for a short time you would have wealth.
[02:45:17.588 --> 02:45:26.373]  Let's say if you have $100,000 to each person in America, of the 300 million people, for a while you would have some wealth, but then that would hyperinflate the currency.
[02:45:27.792 --> 02:45:31.513]  And then you'd have big problems from that and have to go to a new currency.
[02:45:31.513 --> 02:45:50.740]  But instead, and that's bad enough, but instead they are pumping it into these international institutions, predominantly international foreign, and they've stated they're using it to shore themselves up and to buy up more assets, while they continue to cut off currency, liquidity, credit to the public.
[02:45:50.740 --> 02:45:55.162]  And so, I mean, they're giving us no quarter.
[02:45:56.091 --> 02:45:58.229]  Uh, I mean the economy already is grinding to a halt.
[02:45:59.136 --> 02:46:01.118]  This is just going to be devastating.
[02:46:01.118 --> 02:46:01.858]  Well, they know.
[02:46:01.858 --> 02:46:03.439]  They've been through this before.
[02:46:03.439 --> 02:46:11.085]  You know, the major bankers, you know, obviously have been schooled in economics and finance and the history of banking.
[02:46:11.085 --> 02:46:16.910]  Well, they're constantly doing it in third world nations with their subsidiaries, so... Right.
[02:46:16.910 --> 02:46:18.571]  So, none of this is new to them.
[02:46:18.571 --> 02:46:24.195]  They know, for instance, that at the end of the day there will be plants and factories and farms in the United States.
[02:46:24.195 --> 02:46:27.518]  They're not panicked, thinking, you know, they somehow got to get out of town.
[02:46:28.318 --> 02:46:34.261]  You know, they're waiting for the prices to drop to the bottom to buy them up for pennies on a dollar.
[02:46:34.261 --> 02:46:40.404]  They're foreclosing on homes because they know it'll all go back up as it always does eventually, but it'll have new owners.
[02:46:40.404 --> 02:46:41.844]  It'll be the banks.
[02:46:41.844 --> 02:46:43.625]  Now, again, even this isn't new.
[02:46:43.625 --> 02:46:48.027]  You know, the bulk of the concentration of wealth in this nation has happened previously.
[02:46:50.217 --> 02:46:58.139]  You know, by, uh, in 1870 approximately, you know, most people, like I mentioned, had their own farms, their own productive means of wealth.
[02:46:58.139 --> 02:46:59.420]  They had no debt.
[02:46:59.420 --> 02:47:01.640]  Now it's totally reversed, so.
[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:02.280]  And that happened.
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:06.922]  And they framed us that we have to have the bankers in debt to even get our paychecks or have a car.
[02:47:06.922 --> 02:47:09.262]  We've totally been turned into sharecroppers.
[02:47:09.262 --> 02:47:10.883]  That's exactly correct.
[02:47:10.883 --> 02:47:18.585]  And, uh, you know, they got homeowners with all the inflation that they caused by, you know, running the printing presses and the budget deficits.
[02:47:19.285 --> 02:47:24.507]  They got home, you know, the equity in homes, at least on paper, looked like it went up.
[02:47:24.507 --> 02:47:32.249]  So if you had a $200,000 home, say in 1995, you know, by 2000, whatever, five, it's now worth $400,000.
[02:47:32.249 --> 02:47:33.649]  I'm $200,000 richer, right?
[02:47:33.649 --> 02:47:35.570]  Well, no, it's the same home.
[02:47:35.570 --> 02:47:39.551]  But what they did then is they got the homeowners to get home equity loans.
[02:47:41.502 --> 02:47:53.609]  And now they've convinced the public that it's all the public's fault taking bad loans when they're just suckers.
[02:47:53.609 --> 02:47:55.710]  That's a small part of the overall deal.
[02:47:55.710 --> 02:47:59.613]  It's the bundling and the selling of the toxic debt.
[02:48:00.220 --> 02:48:05.183]  Well, and also the misrepresentation and deceit in the subprime loans.
[02:48:05.183 --> 02:48:07.844]  Those things are extremely complex.
[02:48:07.844 --> 02:48:10.066]  And the banks misrepresented them too.
[02:48:10.066 --> 02:48:13.768]  When people come in and say, let me, this language I don't understand.
[02:48:13.768 --> 02:48:15.048]  What does this mean?
[02:48:15.048 --> 02:48:16.129]  And they would lie to them.
[02:48:16.129 --> 02:48:18.270]  And I'm saying that because they're being sued all over the place.
[02:48:18.270 --> 02:48:19.451]  They've already lost some cases.
[02:48:19.451 --> 02:48:20.531]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:48:20.531 --> 02:48:28.756]  What is this where they're now telling people in the last three years, at a closing, oh, sign this form that if there's any mistakes we can change the contract.
[02:48:29.753 --> 02:48:34.459]  And then I've seen reports of them engaging in all sorts of chicanery.
[02:48:34.459 --> 02:48:36.321]  I'm not familiar with the report.
[02:48:36.321 --> 02:48:37.763]  Is it a power of attorney or what is it?
[02:48:37.763 --> 02:48:44.631]  Yeah, it's just a sheet saying if we make any mistakes on this loan, or if there's any mistakes in this paperwork, we're allowed to go change it however we want.
[02:48:46.039 --> 02:48:54.562]  Well, I mean, if you read the fine print on some of the literature you get from banks, they're often adding things that are just incredible.
[02:48:54.562 --> 02:49:10.869]  Most people don't read the little tiny fine print, and it allows them to change terms and conditions, and if they do, you get another letter in the mail you throw away, but it has about a four-page document that informs you, supposedly, that the terms of your loan have been changed, and people don't even know it.
[02:49:12.768 --> 02:49:16.100]  That kind of thing obviously has to be addressed.
[02:49:17.402 --> 02:49:34.427]  Lawsuits and it is being addressed by lawsuits, but you know they have so much money and the average person that Is struggling you know to fight with them has no money and so and they always think the bank's making a mistake Like when the cops arrest an innocent person or the bank takes somebody's house for no reason.
[02:49:34.427 --> 02:49:38.448]  It's always I don't understand It's it's a mistake, and they don't care.
[02:49:38.448 --> 02:49:39.448]  They're stupid.
[02:49:39.448 --> 02:49:39.608]  No.
[02:49:39.608 --> 02:49:40.408]  They're not stupid.
[02:49:40.408 --> 02:49:42.109]  They're in control because they're ruthless crooks
[02:49:42.629 --> 02:50:04.191]  Well, the class action lawsuits that have already been successful in some instances are successful because it's established that it was a deliberate policy, that the people that wrote the language knew it was ambiguous, knew that people would misunderstand it in a certain way, and that they could tell the lower-down bank employees who met with the people
[02:50:05.382 --> 02:50:09.925]  A false version of what it meant, and that those people would tell the borrowers those stories.
[02:50:26.254 --> 02:50:35.743]  Well, and they rely on the banks to tell them what the ambiguous language means.
[02:50:35.743 --> 02:50:39.787]  And they don't have to do that.
[02:50:39.787 --> 02:50:43.551]  They can go to law, if they can afford it, and have that addressed.
[02:50:44.291 --> 02:50:44.731]  Absolutely.
[02:50:44.731 --> 02:50:52.134]  I know somebody in a film production who the person had them sign a contract where they could basically do whatever they wanted, but that would be thrown out in court instantly.
[02:50:52.134 --> 02:50:54.835]  It's written as a criminal instrument.
[02:50:54.835 --> 02:50:56.796]  I mean, it's on its face.
[02:50:56.796 --> 02:50:59.817]  We'll be right back with our guest, the amazing producer of the Money Masters.

[02:51:22.076 --> 02:51:25.620]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:27.942]  And always carry a self-defense device.

[02:51:56.793 --> 02:52:04.738]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[02:52:04.738 --> 02:52:08.220]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:52:08.220 --> 02:52:10.861]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:52:10.861 --> 02:52:12.402]  But who is the enemy?
[02:52:12.402 --> 02:52:13.203]  Bin Laden.
[02:52:13.203 --> 02:52:14.143]  This is his ammo.
[02:52:14.143 --> 02:52:15.584]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:52:15.584 --> 02:52:17.005]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:52:17.545 --> 02:52:24.711]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:52:24.711 --> 02:52:25.171]  Some U.S.
[02:52:25.171 --> 02:52:31.536]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:31.536 --> 02:52:34.999]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:35.239 --> 02:52:45.508]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:52:45.508 --> 02:52:46.749]  Fabled enemies.

[02:53:01.584 --> 02:53:02.325]  You invest.
[02:53:02.325 --> 02:53:03.366]  You buy insurance.
[02:53:03.366 --> 02:53:04.607]  You wear your seatbelt.
[02:53:04.607 --> 02:53:07.469]  You do things to ensure your family's future and protection.
[02:53:07.469 --> 02:53:08.310]  But why?
[02:53:08.310 --> 02:53:09.551]  Just in case?
[02:53:09.551 --> 02:53:12.654]  With the current state of affairs, ask yourself, am I ready?
[02:53:12.654 --> 02:53:15.596]  Preparation starts at SurvivalGearSource.com.

[02:53:49.077 --> 02:53:50.257]  Prepare for tomorrow now.
[02:54:10.538 --> 02:54:25.881]  With the unlimited wealth that the central bankers have created out of fiat with their magician trick, they bought the armies, they bought the think tanks, they bought the media, they bought it all.
[02:54:25.881 --> 02:54:32.963]  Now they're stacking on all these predatory laws to squeeze out what business and industries left they don't control.
[02:54:34.648 --> 02:54:39.052]  And they are putting out swarms of new offices and officers to eat out our substance.
[02:54:39.052 --> 02:54:40.514]  You read the Declaration of Independence lately?
[02:54:40.514 --> 02:54:41.715]  We're gonna start the next hour.
[02:54:41.715 --> 02:54:43.457]  I have our guests with us for 30 minutes.
[02:54:43.457 --> 02:54:46.460]  Dr. Rodney, Russ, Mark, Isaac, Scott, and others.
[02:54:46.460 --> 02:54:50.944]  But looking at the central banks now wanting a world government.
[02:54:52.575 --> 02:55:07.141]  Now saying, oh, well, you know, because of the problems that have been caused that we had nothing to do with, well, the architects of it, we need to be able to globally set what currencies are and commodities are and, you know, so they can now even more insider trade in other sectors of the financial system.
[02:55:09.404 --> 02:55:16.888]  And they say, for decades, they were going to have a carbon tax to fund the new banks, and then it's in the Financial Times of London, BBC.
[02:55:16.888 --> 02:55:20.810]  Barack Obama's saying, we're going to pay our new carbon taxes to the banks themselves.
[02:55:20.810 --> 02:55:25.012]  I mean, they are becoming the government.
[02:55:25.012 --> 02:55:27.073]  And they're just out there openly stealing the money.
[02:55:27.073 --> 02:55:28.454]  Ron Paul said they should be arrested.
[02:55:28.454 --> 02:55:31.735]  He listed the current Fed Chief, the last Fed Chief.
[02:55:31.735 --> 02:55:36.498]  He listed Paul Senn and listed the crimes.
[02:55:36.498 --> 02:55:37.898]  But again, they control the Army.
[02:55:37.898 --> 02:55:38.839]  They control NORTHCOM.
[02:55:39.894 --> 02:55:43.155]  The military doesn't understand this stuff.
[02:55:43.155 --> 02:55:47.256]  How do you unroot something that's been so systematic and scientific?
[02:55:47.256 --> 02:55:51.917]  Well, obviously education is the principal means and that's what you're doing right now.
[02:55:51.917 --> 02:55:54.877]  And by the way, I applaud you for that.
[02:55:54.877 --> 02:56:03.499]  The media that's not controlled is the only source for the people to understand what's happening to them because they certainly will not get it on the major media.
[02:56:03.499 --> 02:56:05.599]  They get just the opposite.
[02:56:05.599 --> 02:56:08.000]  And you're right, on the global scale
[02:56:08.706 --> 02:56:24.893]  The Bank for International Settlements, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund are replicating what the Fed did in the United States, and they're taking over government after government by making huge loans to those governments.
[02:56:24.893 --> 02:56:34.538]  One of the ways is through, you know, a new form of money that was created some years ago called SDRs, or Special Drawing Rights, which they simply create, they loan it to the
[02:56:35.197 --> 02:56:59.734]  To the government, sometimes to dictators who use the money for terrible purposes or just corruption, you know, put it in private Swiss bank accounts and so on and leave the poor nation like Mozambique or Colombia or whatever the third or fourth world nation is to pay the bill and they can't pay it and of course it forces them to tax the people, use what little tax revenue there is
[02:57:00.632 --> 02:57:09.916]  Not for social services, but to pay the bankers from the United States, or England, or one of the other cooperating major banks that do that.
[02:57:09.916 --> 02:57:14.397]  And they all created it out of nothing, and it's come out in IMF and World Bank documents.
[02:57:14.397 --> 02:57:18.819]  They want the dictators and the corrupt leaders to default, and they all move to Switzerland.
[02:57:18.819 --> 02:57:25.582]  Well, sure, because that's precisely how they take over the nation, and whatever nation it is, it's happened over and over again, and then they can move in.
[02:57:26.803 --> 02:57:39.022]  And with the different programs, like SNAPS with the International Monetary Fund, they can engineer things socially in that country as they wish.
[02:57:39.022 --> 02:57:41.646]  They can make all kinds of requirements.
[02:57:42.851 --> 02:57:47.315]  And by the way, if a nation tries to be its own country, they're immediately called terrorists.
[02:57:47.315 --> 02:57:49.176]  Black ops squads go in and overthrow them.
[02:57:49.176 --> 02:57:51.798]  You know, it isn't just these countries accept this fiat currency.
[02:57:51.798 --> 02:57:55.221]  They're told, you do it, or your brains are going to be on the contract.
[02:57:55.221 --> 02:58:05.168]  Yeah, if you go to the International Monetary Fund, they have a table in their annual report called, it's called the Table of Nations in Arrears.
[02:58:05.168 --> 02:58:10.332]  And almost every nation that has the misfortune of appearing on that in their arrears means in-debt payment.
[02:58:11.618 --> 02:58:17.041]  Uh, it winds up either being bombed, or invaded, or has a coup.
[02:58:17.041 --> 02:58:18.401]  Uh, so you're right.
[02:58:18.401 --> 02:58:21.083]  It's more than a knock at the door like the usual debt collector.
[02:58:21.083 --> 02:58:22.403]  It gets pretty serious.
[02:58:22.403 --> 02:58:23.263]  And I want to explain.
[02:58:23.263 --> 02:58:24.944]  They're not going to do that here.
[02:58:24.944 --> 02:58:30.587]  Police officers, military, FBI, private mercenaries.
[02:58:30.587 --> 02:58:32.047]  They are coming.
[02:58:32.047 --> 02:58:33.728]  They have been trained, you're the enemy.
[02:58:33.728 --> 02:58:34.949]  They have been brainwashed.
[02:58:34.949 --> 02:58:36.169]  They are coming.
[02:58:36.169 --> 02:58:37.390]  They are coming.
[02:58:37.390 --> 02:58:38.570]  They are coming.
[02:58:38.570 --> 02:58:39.291]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:42.851 --> 02:58:46.354]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.354 --> 02:58:51.577]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.577 --> 02:58:53.539]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:58:53.539 --> 02:58:57.021]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:57.021 --> 02:58:59.603]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:59.603 --> 02:59:02.645]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:59:02.645 --> 02:59:08.389]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:59:08.389 --> 02:59:12.312]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:59:12.612 --> 02:59:17.816]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:59:17.816 --> 02:59:20.879]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:59:40.225 --> 02:59:45.409]  Well, he's a former judge, former bank head, former oil company head.
[02:59:45.409 --> 02:59:50.072]  Back in the mid-90s, they traveled the world to make the film The Money Masters.
[02:59:50.072 --> 02:59:52.713]  Everything they talked about in it is coming true now.
[02:59:52.713 --> 02:59:56.056]  How the Great Depression was engineered before that, how the Rothschilds took control of England.
[02:59:57.571 --> 03:00:01.612]  Three and a half hour film available at InfoWars.com on DVD.
[03:00:01.612 --> 03:00:11.594]  I hope you get a copy of it, the two DVD set, because this is something that's very important to own and share and show your friends and family and neighbors.
[03:00:11.594 --> 03:00:14.634]  After the break, we're going directly to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:00:14.634 --> 03:00:23.356]  For those watching on PrisonPlanet.tv live right now, we've already had Pat on for 50 minutes, but I wanted him to recap basically
[03:00:24.236 --> 03:00:30.120]  What this international banking system is, how they're operating for this short segment, and we're going to come back and go to your phone calls.
[03:00:30.120 --> 03:00:31.801]  Pat?
[03:00:31.801 --> 03:00:34.042]  Well, the international banking system is interconnected.
[03:00:34.042 --> 03:00:44.689]  Essentially what it is, is an economic scheme, and the scheme entails the creation of money by private banks.
[03:00:44.689 --> 03:00:50.153]  Most people think that the government creates all of our money because they look at our currency and it's
[03:00:50.848 --> 03:00:55.791]  It's printed by the Bureau of Engraving and so forth, and I see there are coins by the U.S.
[03:00:55.791 --> 03:00:56.752]  Mint.
[03:00:56.752 --> 03:01:10.801]  But the fact is, due to the 1913 Federal Reserve Act, which established our present, our fundamental banking law, our fundamental economic law for the United States, that we still have.
[03:01:10.801 --> 03:01:13.302]  It's nearly 100 years old now.
[03:01:13.302 --> 03:01:18.906]  It allows banks to make loans and only have 10% of the funds
[03:01:20.991 --> 03:01:27.673]  Of the loan and reserve, meaning they don't have deposits for it, of 100% behind the loans.
[03:01:27.673 --> 03:01:29.314]  It's only about 10%.
[03:01:29.314 --> 03:01:35.876]  Actually, due to a certain exception to the law, it's more like 2%, but just for simplicity, it's about 10%.
[03:01:35.876 --> 03:01:47.720]  And so, of the loans in the United States, which total nearly $10 trillion, the government has benefited from creating only about 10% of that.
[03:01:49.426 --> 03:01:53.587]  And who gets the rest of the benefit is private banks.
[03:01:53.587 --> 03:02:07.091]  And of that, of course, benefits indirectly the stockholders of those banks, and those people now control as much wealth, 1% of the United States population owns as much as the other, as the lower 95%.
[03:02:07.091 --> 03:02:12.272]  So we've had a tremendous concentration of wealth, which has changed the structure of American society.
[03:02:12.272 --> 03:02:17.594]  It's making the great bulk of Americans into debt slaves, and
[03:02:18.684 --> 03:02:23.447]  And a very, very few fabulously wealthy.
[03:02:23.447 --> 03:02:28.009]  And this latest economic crisis has accelerated the process.
[03:02:28.009 --> 03:02:41.396]  The banks have used their money and their political influence at buys to obtain this $700 billion bailout, which they're using to consolidate wealth even faster.
[03:02:41.396 --> 03:02:46.799]  And right now we have no politician who's in a position of power
[03:02:47.295 --> 03:02:47.575]  It's
[03:03:08.900 --> 03:03:09.180]  I think so.
[03:03:30.618 --> 03:03:36.181]  You know, De Beers, Oppenheimer, Diamond Monopoly, they brag, they hire mercenaries and kush.
[03:03:36.181 --> 03:03:53.769]  I mean, this small group of global families, less than a hundred, and in the banking it's only four or five big ones, I mean, while their CEOs are making $500 million a year, they are leveraging trillions and trillions and have created a tsunami of fiat currency that they are buying up the world with.
[03:03:54.289 --> 03:03:54.669]  We're good to go.
[03:04:24.910 --> 03:04:29.438]  But you like black uniforms, so I guess it's okay.
[03:04:29.438 --> 03:04:31.761]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[03:04:31.761 --> 03:04:37.511]  If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately.
[03:04:37.970 --> 03:04:40.911]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?

[03:05:40.421 --> 03:05:41.201]  Bin Laden.
[03:05:41.201 --> 03:05:42.222]  This is his ammo.
[03:05:42.222 --> 03:05:43.542]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:05:43.542 --> 03:05:45.583]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:05:45.583 --> 03:05:52.726]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:05:52.726 --> 03:05:53.206]  Some U.S.
[03:05:53.206 --> 03:05:58.849]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:05:59.549 --> 03:06:03.030]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:05.210]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:06:31.095 --> 03:06:36.743]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?

[03:07:02.044 --> 03:07:05.506]  A simple, easy way to eliminate the threat of cancer.
[03:07:05.506 --> 03:07:07.787]  Laser technology at its best.
[03:07:07.787 --> 03:07:10.989]  To receive an information packet, call our treatment center at 501-255-7000.
[03:07:13.270 --> 03:07:20.093]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:20.093 --> 03:07:22.533]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:43.410 --> 03:07:48.895]  We have the producer of the number one film I've ever seen exposing the private banking cartel.
[03:07:48.895 --> 03:07:50.956]  This runs your whole life.
[03:07:50.956 --> 03:07:51.517]  It's why.
[03:07:51.517 --> 03:07:53.919]  The social engineering, all of it.
[03:07:53.919 --> 03:07:56.581]  You heard him earlier talking about, you know, the book that they gave to the U.S.
[03:07:56.581 --> 03:08:08.431]  Foreign Service and the CIA, commissioned for the government as their historian internally of the British Roundtable Group, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, and the Council on Foreign Relations, the real government.
[03:08:09.331 --> 03:08:11.913]  Of the United States and of course England.
[03:08:11.913 --> 03:08:13.655]  And it's all stated there.
[03:08:13.655 --> 03:08:15.996]  I've read the book, actually all 900 pages.
[03:08:15.996 --> 03:08:21.240]  I read about half of it years ago and I actually read the rest of it a few months ago.
[03:08:21.240 --> 03:08:24.543]  Not just the quotes, I mean it's all there.
[03:08:24.543 --> 03:08:27.085]  And this isn't a joke, it isn't a game.
[03:08:27.085 --> 03:08:30.888]  And it's not just in that document, it's in thousands of others.
[03:08:31.764 --> 03:08:33.125]  And they told you it didn't exist.
[03:08:33.125 --> 03:08:35.046]  They said, don't worry, there's not bad people.
[03:08:35.046 --> 03:08:36.407]  Nobody's cheating you.
[03:08:36.407 --> 03:08:37.128]  Be lazy.
[03:08:37.128 --> 03:08:37.969]  Procrastinate.
[03:08:37.969 --> 03:08:40.030]  You don't want to believe that.
[03:08:40.030 --> 03:08:41.811]  And now they're bringing the country down.
[03:08:41.811 --> 03:08:44.894]  I mean, this is going to dwarf the Depression the way it's shaping up.
[03:08:44.894 --> 03:08:48.016]  I want to go to your phone calls here.
[03:08:48.016 --> 03:08:53.680]  My IM to the network in Minnesota is down today, so I've mixed up my call list.
[03:08:53.680 --> 03:08:55.101]  Who's up first here?
[03:08:55.101 --> 03:08:56.802]  Rodney in Ohio.
[03:08:56.802 --> 03:08:58.063]  Ah, Rodney in Ohio.
[03:08:58.063 --> 03:09:00.085]  You're on the air with our guest.
[03:09:00.888 --> 03:09:04.271]  Yes, good afternoon Alex and Patrick.
[03:09:04.271 --> 03:09:05.291]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[03:09:05.291 --> 03:09:09.094]  I'm a first-time caller and a Prison Planet TV subscriber.
[03:09:09.094 --> 03:09:10.315]  Thank you.
[03:09:10.315 --> 03:09:16.300]  I have some other things I was wanting to bring up, but since it took so long, I can shift, like you say, shift gears.
[03:09:16.300 --> 03:09:17.741]  No, talk about whatever you want, sir.
[03:09:17.741 --> 03:09:18.602]  Our guests can comment.
[03:09:18.602 --> 03:09:19.282]  Go ahead.
[03:09:19.282 --> 03:09:26.808]  Well, no, this works out just fine because I understand Patrick is a judge and been a judge, lawyer.
[03:09:27.962 --> 03:09:35.368]  I'm trying to protect myself against some of this, and I filed a denial of corporate existence today.
[03:09:35.368 --> 03:09:38.491]  Patrick, do you think that'll help me?
[03:09:38.491 --> 03:09:40.112]  Is that viable or whatever?
[03:09:40.112 --> 03:09:43.836]  I don't have enough information to comment on it.
[03:09:43.836 --> 03:09:44.996]  I'm sorry.
[03:09:44.996 --> 03:09:47.939]  He'd have to know your specifics.
[03:09:47.939 --> 03:09:53.644]  Well, most people don't understand that the United States was incorporated in 1871, am I correct?
[03:09:57.926 --> 03:10:01.109]  Well, go ahead with the rest of your... I'm not quite sure what you're referring to.
[03:10:01.109 --> 03:10:14.681]  Well, in other words... Well, that claim of it being incorporated in Delaware has been found to be a similar corporate name, but not accurate, but it does operate as a corporation, just like chartered cities do, but go ahead.
[03:10:14.681 --> 03:10:16.242]  Well, that's correct, yeah.
[03:10:16.242 --> 03:10:25.770]  Well, let's... I was listening to Jim Percy the other day on the Power Hour, and I'd heard this term before, and I did some more research,
[03:10:26.972 --> 03:10:45.404]  And he also brought up the fact that all courts operate under Admiralty law and that's why they have the flag with the gold fringe and gold tassel hanging in it because the Constitution is not in effect in their courts.
[03:10:45.404 --> 03:10:49.887]  The judge more or less goes about whatever rule he feels fit to enforce.
[03:10:49.887 --> 03:10:51.248]  Is this correct?
[03:10:52.188 --> 03:10:56.469]  Well, there's a lot of esoteric theories like that.
[03:10:56.469 --> 03:10:57.830]  Where is he going with it?
[03:10:57.830 --> 03:11:00.210]  What are you trying to do with this theory?
[03:11:00.210 --> 03:11:01.771]  Defend yourself from what?
[03:11:01.771 --> 03:11:04.371]  Well, it's not about constitutional law.
[03:11:04.371 --> 03:11:08.453]  It's all about corporation law.
[03:11:08.453 --> 03:11:12.714]  I mean, he was an administrative law judge, so he can specifically speak to that.
[03:11:13.464 --> 03:11:18.609]  Well, are you being, are you talking about, is this concerning taxes or what is it?
[03:11:18.609 --> 03:11:19.349]  Taxes?
[03:11:19.349 --> 03:11:27.356]  I'm talking about mortgages, contracts you're entering into as far as mortgages.
[03:11:27.356 --> 03:11:36.845]  When the state, federal government files charges against you or you're brought into law under a subpoena or whatever, it's all in capital letters.
[03:11:36.845 --> 03:11:38.907]  Well, let me... It goes to the straw man.
[03:11:39.488 --> 03:11:45.831]  Let me say this, and Alex is probably better informed about this than I am.
[03:11:45.831 --> 03:11:57.395]  The information I have about the use of these various esoteric theories of the sort that you're mentioning is that they're generally unsuccessful.
[03:11:57.395 --> 03:12:04.258]  There have been a few cases where they have been successful, but very few.
[03:12:04.258 --> 03:12:07.800]  First off, you have to be prepared to suffer the consequences if you're not successful.
[03:12:09.375 --> 03:12:14.261]  I would say, and I appreciate your call sir, let me comment on this.
[03:12:14.261 --> 03:12:18.647]  Generally, we call it patriot mythology.
[03:12:18.647 --> 03:12:24.294]  And I've seen a lot of friends and neighbors, people didn't listen to me, going back 12, 14 years, go to prison.
[03:12:24.294 --> 03:12:25.596]  Or lose their houses over this.
[03:12:27.099 --> 03:12:47.001]  Instead of attacking the corrupt system through the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, them violating their own codes and procedures, which they tend to follow more than the Constitution, Bill of Rights itself, and instead of using areas where they violated their own rules, there's all sorts of people with the straw man and the all caps, and it's just pure baloney.
[03:12:48.423 --> 03:13:00.037]  Now, it is true that the flag means Admiralty, and that there is Admiralty law, and I've seen federal cases where they're seizing people's property in federal court and saying we're doing this under Admiralty.
[03:13:00.037 --> 03:13:02.500]  And look, I mean, here's an example.
[03:13:02.500 --> 03:13:05.603]  There is total lawlessness, say, a hundred years ago with Pinkerton security.
[03:13:06.144 --> 03:13:07.165]  Hired by the Rockefellers.
[03:13:07.165 --> 03:13:09.486]  There were hundreds of cases of this just with them alone.
[03:13:09.486 --> 03:13:17.953]  Where people would have a title to a gold mine, there'd be a squatters camp living there with the deed that they got from, say, forest land out in the territory.
[03:13:17.953 --> 03:13:23.777]  And they'd just ride in and kill everybody and nobody's going to stand up against Rockefeller because, you know, he owns Congress.
[03:13:23.777 --> 03:13:24.918]  And he owns the local governor.
[03:13:25.698 --> 03:13:33.442]  We'd have certain states where they did own the governor, where they would just kill and mow down whole families and just murder everybody and take land, water rights.
[03:13:33.442 --> 03:13:35.903]  So it is lawless.
[03:13:35.903 --> 03:13:38.885]  And then you've got brainwashed cops that don't even know which end is up.
[03:13:38.885 --> 03:13:40.445]  The public doesn't know anything.
[03:13:40.445 --> 03:13:42.406]  Doesn't even know the Federal Reserve is private.
[03:13:42.406 --> 03:13:48.189]  And so you do have a lot of rampant corruption saying you've got to take inoculations, there's no law to do that.
[03:13:48.189 --> 03:13:53.252]  Just writing parents tickets for their child talking in class when there's not even something in the statutes.
[03:13:53.752 --> 03:14:00.157]  I mean, we have a lawless, rogue, color of law, baboon government at the local level.
[03:14:00.157 --> 03:14:00.997]  But that's by design.
[03:14:00.997 --> 03:14:02.718]  The system hires baboons.
[03:14:02.718 --> 03:14:06.141]  They hire thugs and criminals.
[03:14:06.141 --> 03:14:12.845]  And people get mad at me every time I say these patriot mythologies are at best very dangerous.
[03:14:12.845 --> 03:14:17.749]  Because let's say there's some grain of truth in them, you're not going to know how to implement them.
[03:14:18.369 --> 03:14:19.872]  And I see people get torn up and torn up.
[03:14:19.872 --> 03:14:26.842]  Now finally people have thanked me, you know, ten years later because now it's kind of washed itself out with the public seeing enough people being torn apart.
[03:14:26.842 --> 03:14:28.084]  But I don't want to spend all day on that.
[03:14:28.084 --> 03:14:30.107]  I want to get to the other calls.
[03:14:30.107 --> 03:14:30.928]  Do you agree with that statement?
[03:14:33.463 --> 03:14:34.944]  Hey Alex, hey Pat, how's it going?
[03:15:04.009 --> 03:15:09.271]  Family and friends that the stock market was inflated and that we're heading toward the crash.
[03:15:09.271 --> 03:15:13.612]  And for those that didn't listen, they lost tens of thousands of dollars.
[03:15:13.612 --> 03:15:20.074]  And now when I talk to people, they have the mindset that, well, okay, it crashed, but it'll go back up.
[03:15:20.074 --> 03:15:29.396]  And so when I look at back in 1913, the Dow Jones was at 60, and now it's around 8,000-something.
[03:15:29.396 --> 03:15:31.257]  So my question to you is, you guys are
[03:15:32.722 --> 03:15:45.550]  You know, the price of gold, or gold as a commodity, maintains its value, but when someone invests in the stock market over the long haul, does that maintain its value?
[03:15:45.550 --> 03:15:48.472]  Well, it sort of depends on what time period you look at.
[03:15:48.472 --> 03:15:59.600]  It was kind of interesting, but in recent years, you know, stockbrokers have used, when one time period doesn't work, they make it longer or shorter, as the case may be,
[03:16:00.672 --> 03:16:04.295]  Well, I mean, what I'm asking is, for people that have lost money recently,
[03:16:27.897 --> 03:16:31.920]  Is the mindset that it'll go back up and everything's going to be okay, is that relevant?
[03:16:31.920 --> 03:16:33.721]  I mean, does the stock market increase?
[03:16:33.721 --> 03:16:36.183]  Let me tell you what's relevant.
[03:16:36.183 --> 03:16:38.725]  We're seeing the biggest hyperinflation in U.S.
[03:16:38.725 --> 03:16:40.786]  history since right after its founding.
[03:16:40.786 --> 03:16:42.687]  They had one just as bad then.
[03:16:42.687 --> 03:16:45.629]  We're seeing the worst hyperinflation ever coming.
[03:16:45.629 --> 03:16:47.731]  It's already here, but it's going to get a lot worse.
[03:16:48.391 --> 03:16:59.238]  And so, people are going to have to dump basically everything they've got to get out of the market, and then you're only going to have the big institutions that inflated the currency to get flush in cash, who are going to be able to come in and buy it up.
[03:16:59.238 --> 03:17:00.358]  Mr. Carmack, do you agree with that?
[03:17:00.358 --> 03:17:02.520]  Yeah, I do.
[03:17:02.520 --> 03:17:07.263]  You know, obviously they are creating money at a very rapid rate.
[03:17:07.263 --> 03:17:12.846]  We all know that the government numbers, the CPI, you know, 1-2% flush in, nonsense.
[03:17:13.815 --> 03:17:21.977]  And that's another form of wealth transfer, because it reduces Social Security payments, and it's used for, you know, for union contracts.
[03:17:21.977 --> 03:17:22.718]  Yeah, that's the key.
[03:17:22.718 --> 03:17:25.899]  People on fixed incomes, by the way, are the ones that are really going to get hammered.
[03:17:25.899 --> 03:17:26.639]  Go ahead.
[03:17:26.639 --> 03:17:27.439]  Yeah.
[03:17:27.439 --> 03:17:37.422]  So, I mean, you may see values go up, but inflation's going to probably go up even faster, so you have to factor that out when you make your calculations about the stock market in the first place.
[03:17:37.422 --> 03:17:40.323]  I don't think anybody quite knows yet how far down it's going to go.
[03:17:41.370 --> 03:17:44.434]  And then how long it's going to be down.
[03:17:44.434 --> 03:17:49.002]  This is a very profound economic crisis that's happening.
[03:17:52.202 --> 03:17:59.447]  Yeah, so if you're looking for sort of indirect advice on how to invest, I can't give it to you.
[03:17:59.447 --> 03:18:01.468]  These things haven't worked themselves out yet.
[03:18:01.468 --> 03:18:14.457]  Yeah, folks, if you're mega flush in all sorts of assets and diversified, you know, invest all day, but people that have gotten to that position generally, unless it's through inheritance, you know what you need to do yourself, you know your own position.
[03:18:14.457 --> 03:18:16.739]  But for other folks, you need to
[03:18:18.041 --> 03:18:24.165]  You know, get down to basics and prepare for really hard times ahead.
[03:18:24.165 --> 03:18:28.848]  But listen, the general public's going to stay on the stock market until that thing goes all the way down.
[03:18:28.848 --> 03:18:30.970]  The globalists are completely ruthless.
[03:18:30.970 --> 03:18:32.451]  They want to drive it down.
[03:18:32.451 --> 03:18:38.535]  So I would say in the next year, I'll say right now, I think the stock market's going down to below $5,000.
[03:18:38.535 --> 03:18:40.536]  It may go even lower.
[03:18:40.536 --> 03:18:43.138]  And then after they buy it all up, it's going to go back up again.
[03:18:43.138 --> 03:18:45.199]  Then you're going to have hyperinflation on top of that.
[03:18:45.199 --> 03:18:45.259]  Pat?
[03:18:47.253 --> 03:18:49.634]  Well yeah, it's a pretty safe bet.
[03:18:49.634 --> 03:18:51.755]  It's eventually going to go back up again.
[03:18:51.755 --> 03:19:01.079]  And it's obvious we're going to have very high levels of inflation for the next few years.
[03:19:01.079 --> 03:19:01.719]  Absolutely.
[03:19:01.719 --> 03:19:03.800]  I mean, we mean brutal.
[03:19:03.800 --> 03:19:05.321]  Brutal, brutal.
[03:19:05.321 --> 03:19:07.342]  Did that answer your question, Russ?
[03:19:08.137 --> 03:19:13.500]  Yeah, I just think people right now are still in denial that everything's going to be fine and don't see the big picture.
[03:19:13.500 --> 03:19:16.222]  Yeah, well, I don't know how much denial they're in.
[03:19:16.222 --> 03:19:18.363]  They're realizing the banker takeover's a big fraud.
[03:19:18.363 --> 03:19:24.647]  By the way, we had Ron Paul on at the very start of the show today, coming up in about 40 minutes when we go into rebroadcast.
[03:19:24.647 --> 03:19:27.608]  At the very start of the show, Ron Paul with key info.
[03:19:27.608 --> 03:19:28.209]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:29.867 --> 03:19:39.874]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights, on toll booths, and scanning the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate, only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[03:19:39.874 --> 03:19:43.436]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.
[03:19:43.436 --> 03:19:45.857]  Spray your plate, it'll feed a big picture.
[03:19:45.857 --> 03:19:46.438]  Yeah, well...
[03:19:47.059 --> 03:19:48.581]  I don't know how much denial they're in.
[03:19:48.581 --> 03:19:50.665]  They're realizing the banker takeover is a big fraud.
[03:19:50.665 --> 03:19:54.091]  By the way, we had Ron Paul on at the very start of the show today.
[03:19:54.091 --> 03:19:57.015]  Coming up in about 40 minutes when we go into rebroadcast.
[03:19:57.015 --> 03:19:59.620]  At the very start of the show, Ron Paul with key info.

[03:20:02.165 --> 03:20:12.153]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights, on toll booths, and scanning the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate, only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[03:20:12.153 --> 03:20:15.736]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.

[03:20:53.644 --> 03:20:54.486]  Spray your plate!
[03:21:01.872 --> 03:21:02.633]  Gold.
[03:21:02.633 --> 03:21:04.194]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[03:21:04.194 --> 03:21:10.478]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[03:21:10.478 --> 03:21:14.641]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:21:14.641 --> 03:21:16.603]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:21:16.603 --> 03:21:19.025]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:21:19.025 --> 03:21:26.630]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[03:21:26.830 --> 03:21:27.511]  We're good to go.
[03:21:41.747 --> 03:21:45.570]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero, and we knew what to do.
[03:22:09.355 --> 03:22:10.618]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:22:10.618 --> 03:22:16.973]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:22:19.428 --> 03:22:26.553]  The ACA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:22:26.553 --> 03:22:33.638]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:22:33.638 --> 03:22:36.800]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:22:36.800 --> 03:22:41.864]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:22:42.584 --> 03:22:45.687]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:22:45.687 --> 03:22:51.593]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[03:22:54.656 --> 03:22:59.561]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:23:00.908 --> 03:23:09.614]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[03:23:09.614 --> 03:23:15.599]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[03:23:15.599 --> 03:23:22.704]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[03:23:22.704 --> 03:23:26.106]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[03:23:26.106 --> 03:23:29.048]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing... Are you encoding?
[03:23:31.904 --> 03:23:33.025]  Hold on, who are they?
[03:23:33.025 --> 03:23:35.867]  Uh, we got Mark, Isaac, and then Scott dropped off.
[03:23:35.867 --> 03:23:37.888]  Hold on, Mark where?
[03:23:37.888 --> 03:23:40.330]  Um, no, Mark in Oregon's next.
[03:23:40.330 --> 03:23:41.290]  Uh-huh.
[03:23:41.290 --> 03:23:43.472]  Isaac in New York.
[03:23:43.472 --> 03:23:43.972]  Uh-huh.
[03:23:43.972 --> 03:23:45.473]  Then we have Chris in Toronto.
[03:23:45.473 --> 03:23:46.234]  That's enough, here we go.
[03:23:46.234 --> 03:23:50.236]  Okay.
[03:23:50.236 --> 03:23:55.560]  We're gonna keep our guests with us until about 40 after, then I'm gonna cover the forced inoculation news.
[03:23:55.560 --> 03:23:56.801]  Very important information.
[03:23:58.934 --> 03:24:01.155]  Some other key financial information today.
[03:24:01.155 --> 03:24:03.136]  Don't forget, Ron Paul was on the start of the show today.
[03:24:03.136 --> 03:24:07.197]  A lot of key info.
[03:24:07.197 --> 03:24:08.978]  Let's go ahead and go to Mark in Oregon.
[03:24:08.978 --> 03:24:11.859]  You're on the air with the producer of the Money Masters, Pat Carmack.
[03:24:11.859 --> 03:24:13.239]  Go ahead.
[03:24:13.239 --> 03:24:15.560]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex and Pat.
[03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:16.961]  Good afternoon.
[03:24:16.961 --> 03:24:25.744]  Alex, I did want to mention to you real quick about if you have the need any time in the rest of your life to have a beer, do not drink any of the
[03:24:27.656 --> 03:24:43.006]  I know they have a lot of bad chemicals in them, Budweiser isn't even brewed anymore, it's a syrup added to carbonated water.
[03:24:43.006 --> 03:24:48.569]  Yeah, will definitely affect your health adversely in a real quick way.
[03:24:48.569 --> 03:24:55.574]  You know, Pat, I was wondering if you could extrapolate for me a little bit, being as you're well-versed in the economic
[03:24:56.352 --> 03:24:56.672]  I don't know.
[03:25:17.262 --> 03:25:30.908]  And how the United States is basically funding it, and where are we going to be at, per se, in the United States being on the bottom rung of the ladder of all of this, basically, as far as our welfare on a financial level goes?
[03:25:30.908 --> 03:25:34.109]  Where are we going to be two or three or four months down the line from here?
[03:25:34.109 --> 03:25:37.351]  How will this tremendous iceberg surface in our reality?
[03:25:38.149 --> 03:25:41.851]  On an economic level here, thus affecting our quality of life.
[03:25:41.851 --> 03:25:44.052]  What would be the different aspects?
[03:25:44.052 --> 03:25:51.335]  Well, I would just say we're going to be fully drained to build the New World Order, and then the building of it, we're going to be blamed for.
[03:25:51.335 --> 03:25:57.358]  So we're going to be turned into a third world country, a cesspit of police state, to riddle over the slaves.
[03:25:58.678 --> 03:26:13.148]  And then, it's such an important question, I'm putting out my answer, and then we'll also, again, not just pay for the New World Order, but then be hated and be blamed for the crises that they then build their New World Order out of.
[03:26:13.148 --> 03:26:14.809]  Pat?
[03:26:14.809 --> 03:26:26.977]  Well, if I understand the question correctly, you know, looking three to four months ahead, I don't think anybody, no matter what side of this issue they're on, thinks things are going to be dramatically better, or even a little better.
[03:26:26.977 --> 03:26:27.678]  It's going to be worse.
[03:26:28.858 --> 03:26:31.339]  Obviously, we're going to see unemployment rise.
[03:26:31.339 --> 03:26:35.901]  Inflation is going to go up considerably more than it is now.
[03:26:35.901 --> 03:26:55.048]  I think you're going to see probably the stock market continue to decline and so forth, and you're going to see the Fed spending hundreds of billions, giving much of it to major banks that the Fed's creating, I mean, the money they're creating.
[03:26:56.718 --> 03:27:05.923]  That's going to obviously fuel inflation as well, and it decreases the value of everyone else's money to the benefit of the major banks that are receiving those funds.
[03:27:05.923 --> 03:27:13.768]  So, you know, there's not much happy news in the near term that I think anybody would predict.
[03:27:13.768 --> 03:27:18.030]  The housing crisis is probably going to worsen.
[03:27:18.030 --> 03:27:22.293]  You know, there's various kinds of subprime
[03:27:24.015 --> 03:27:26.818]  I forget what they call them, re-adjustments.
[03:27:26.818 --> 03:27:29.039]  Re-adjustments, yeah.
[03:27:29.039 --> 03:27:32.842]  That don't even peak until 2011.
[03:27:32.842 --> 03:27:35.785]  And we've got credit card that's around a trillion coming due.
[03:27:35.785 --> 03:27:38.867]  People are defaulting at record levels.
[03:27:38.867 --> 03:27:42.530]  We have car loans, business loans, default, default, default.
[03:27:42.530 --> 03:27:44.812]  You ain't seen nothing yet, folks.
[03:27:44.812 --> 03:27:47.695]  So I think you want to be conservative about things.
[03:27:47.695 --> 03:27:49.016]  It's not a time to go into debt.
[03:27:51.451 --> 03:27:51.832]  Great show.
[03:27:51.832 --> 03:27:55.296]  One other thing, I think it'll take an act of God basically to straighten this one out, Alex.
[03:28:10.834 --> 03:28:13.455]  But again, thank you.
[03:28:13.455 --> 03:28:14.995]  People think the drug war is failing.
[03:28:14.995 --> 03:28:16.055]  It's an incredible success.
[03:28:16.055 --> 03:28:16.715]  They ship it in.
[03:28:16.715 --> 03:28:21.036]  They put your kids in prison, in private prison owned by the banks that launder the drug money.
[03:28:21.036 --> 03:28:25.317]  People think the war on illiteracy is going horribly.
[03:28:25.317 --> 03:28:25.757]  No.
[03:28:25.757 --> 03:28:26.817]  I have all the federal documents.
[03:28:26.817 --> 03:28:31.638]  I've had the former head of policy, Department of Education on where they were openly there to dumb everybody down.
[03:28:31.638 --> 03:28:37.120]  And I have the Banking Association documents in their public letter from over a hundred years ago saying we've got to dumb people down.
[03:28:37.120 --> 03:28:37.960]  We've got to buy up the
[03:28:38.740 --> 03:28:42.323]  The schools, the newspapers, and dumb them down.
[03:28:42.323 --> 03:28:48.589]  These people are too smart to be able to be enslaved.
[03:28:48.589 --> 03:28:51.111]  Education's doing a great job, meant to dumb them down.
[03:28:51.111 --> 03:28:55.776]  Drug war's great, more drugs, more people in prison than ever.
[03:28:55.776 --> 03:28:57.537]  This is their business, folks.
[03:28:57.537 --> 03:29:00.060]  These are cold-blooded people with military minds.
[03:29:00.060 --> 03:29:01.141]  Pat, you agree with that statement?
[03:29:01.900 --> 03:29:10.307]  Well, I think that there's no question the American people have been dumbed down and we need to return to classical education like the Founders had.
[03:29:10.307 --> 03:29:13.189]  You know, they understood what was happening because they were well-educated.
[03:29:13.189 --> 03:29:16.412]  Hold on, I'm going to skip this break for the InfoWars listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv folks.
[03:29:16.412 --> 03:29:18.994]  We still have plenty of time to finish up with you.
[03:29:18.994 --> 03:29:19.775]  Stay with us.
[03:29:19.775 --> 03:29:21.336]  We're on the mark.
[03:29:21.336 --> 03:29:22.677]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:29:22.677 --> 03:29:25.539]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:25.539 --> 03:29:29.943]  Okay, yeah, Pat, we're just on the web right now, but that's a substantive audience.
[03:29:29.943 --> 03:29:30.584]  I want to
[03:29:32.860 --> 03:29:34.762]  Let you continue what you were saying, go ahead.
[03:29:34.762 --> 03:29:45.209]  Well, you know, like, there's even a, I think it's a homeschool program now called the Jefferson Education or something of that kind, and people back then were actually well-educated.
[03:29:45.209 --> 03:29:51.493]  Literacy rates were considerably higher in the late 1700s, 1800s in the United States.
[03:29:51.493 --> 03:29:59.399]  Our educational system is a complete bust, and that, you know, in a way, that's our problem, because they never could have pulled off
[03:30:00.697 --> 03:30:07.002]  For instance, this bailout or any of these other horrible changes in laws that are happening in modern times.
[03:30:07.002 --> 03:30:15.629]  If people were well-educated, they're able to just lie to the people, misdescribe, misrepresent what's happening, and everyone just accepts it.
[03:30:15.629 --> 03:30:21.774]  They accept what they see on TV, so nobody's reading anymore.
[03:30:21.774 --> 03:30:29.500]  The lack of education is really one of the roots of this problem, and it goes back to
[03:30:31.163 --> 03:30:45.073]  All the way back to when we began mass education in this country, which, by the way, was subsequently heavily financed by the bank, because they saw an opportunity to use it not to educate, but to make sure people were not educated.
[03:30:45.073 --> 03:30:53.378]  There is a movement, you know, homeschooling is part of it, by the way, in the United States, to restore authentic education in the United States.
[03:30:53.378 --> 03:30:57.701]  And that's already got over two million students that are being home-educated.
[03:30:59.406 --> 03:31:20.490]  And so the establishment is countering, in California they came out, what, five months ago with a ruling, and it said the state, I mean I read the state ruling here on air, it said the state, I mean there's statements like, you know, it's improperly believed, these aren't even findings in law, it just sounds like mumbo-jumbo from a social worker.
[03:31:21.050 --> 03:31:26.835]  You know, that the state has no job parenting, but that's not true.
[03:31:26.835 --> 03:31:28.896]  The state basically is the parent.
[03:31:28.896 --> 03:31:35.241]  And if you don't have a full teaching certificate, specifically a degree in teaching, you can't homeschool.
[03:31:35.241 --> 03:31:38.804]  And they're trying that in other parts of the world and other parts of the U.S.
[03:31:38.804 --> 03:31:50.152]  And on its face, homeschoolers in college entrance exams, in high school exit exams, efficiency exams,
[03:31:51.317 --> 03:32:05.540]  In everything they show, in the Spelling Bees, in Geography Bees, the homeschoolers are, as a group, not just the creme de la creme, but the entire group, themselves of the creme, they are the creme of the creme.
[03:32:05.540 --> 03:32:08.761]  What I'm saying is not just the top of the homeschoolers, but the entire body.
[03:32:08.761 --> 03:32:17.483]  And so the establishment sees that as a threat, and they call CPS on them, and the state is honing in with vicious abandon.
[03:32:18.423 --> 03:32:21.366]  Uh, directly on that institution as it grows.
[03:32:21.366 --> 03:32:23.949]  As we go from a million homeschoolers to closer to three million now.
[03:32:23.949 --> 03:32:25.330]  It's growing exponentially.
[03:32:25.330 --> 03:32:26.992]  And we're going to go back live on the full audience.
[03:32:26.992 --> 03:32:27.832]  I want your comment on that.
[03:32:27.832 --> 03:32:28.133]  Here we go.
[03:32:33.066 --> 03:32:40.528]  For those that are listening on the MNFM shortwave satellite, we were just talking about education being the key and how by design they've done the children down.
[03:32:40.528 --> 03:32:42.168]  We've got millions of homeschoolers now.
[03:32:42.168 --> 03:32:44.088]  It's growing exponentially.
[03:32:44.088 --> 03:32:47.149]  So California is banning homeschooling.
[03:32:47.149 --> 03:32:48.009]  It's totally criminal.
[03:32:48.009 --> 03:32:49.430]  The state doesn't own your children.
[03:32:49.430 --> 03:32:52.090]  But again, this is the manifestation of true tyranny.
[03:32:52.090 --> 03:33:00.732]  And I wanted to get Mr. Carmack, Judge Carmack, former bank president Carmack's comment on the statement I just made.
[03:33:01.482 --> 03:33:11.711]  Well, actually, that was the status of that case, but in California, the same court reversed itself unanimously, as I heard.
[03:33:11.711 --> 03:33:12.432]  Oh, that's good news!
[03:33:12.432 --> 03:33:13.994]  I was saying it was a fraud.
[03:33:13.994 --> 03:33:26.185]  Yeah, they ruled, actually, that families are, in effect, a form of private schools, which made them, therefore, comply with the law, because the law required that kids be in schools.
[03:33:26.949 --> 03:33:30.192]  And I saw in California that was successfully beat back.
[03:33:30.192 --> 03:33:34.677]  In fact, Governor Schwarzenegger actually supported the homeschoolers in that.
[03:33:34.677 --> 03:33:49.111]  And so did the Homeschool Legal Defense Association, which is a very fine organization that defends homeschooling across the United States and has helped defeat efforts by
[03:33:49.673 --> 03:33:50.533]  The teachers' union.
[03:33:50.533 --> 03:33:52.234]  Well, see, people think I know everything.
[03:33:52.234 --> 03:33:54.295]  I get emails every day, why did you report on this?
[03:33:54.295 --> 03:33:55.096]  Why didn't you cover that?
[03:33:55.096 --> 03:33:56.296]  You're covering it up.
[03:33:56.296 --> 03:33:57.317]  No, I'm not.
[03:33:57.317 --> 03:34:00.159]  There's so much happening that none of us know at all, folks.
[03:34:00.159 --> 03:34:01.739]  In fact, I know very little.
[03:34:01.739 --> 03:34:03.880]  That's what freaks me out.
[03:34:03.880 --> 03:34:07.642]  Well, you were certainly right, though, about homeschooling expanding.
[03:34:07.642 --> 03:34:11.544]  It's definitely an exponential expansion.
[03:34:11.544 --> 03:34:14.506]  And not only that, the quality of it has gone up dramatically.
[03:34:14.506 --> 03:34:17.688]  You know, originally, people, basically back in the 80s,
[03:34:18.820 --> 03:34:19.120]  I think so.
[03:34:33.752 --> 03:34:38.774]  And that's what's changing things now, is that 10, 20 years ago, there weren't these huge communities.
[03:34:38.774 --> 03:34:47.417]  Here in Austin, we're right up to the point of having to make the decision whether to homeschool or not, or go the private school route if we can afford that.
[03:34:47.417 --> 03:34:53.699]  Just because it's, quote, easier on us, we know we probably should just go ahead and go that route, but I won't be able to work as much if we do that and we have the bigger fight.
[03:34:54.439 --> 03:35:00.803]  But now there's these soccer leagues and baseball and groups and they're so diverse and so many choices.
[03:35:00.803 --> 03:35:07.547]  That community, that core community growing, getting back to true communities, that is scaring the controllers.
[03:35:07.547 --> 03:35:19.274]  Well, and actually statistics show that homeschoolers engage in more social activities of the various kinds you've mentioned and others than kids who are in either private or public school.
[03:35:19.274 --> 03:35:22.056]  They also academically outperform private school students.
[03:35:22.745 --> 03:35:32.172]  Yeah, on average they spend about two and a half hours, but it's real learning in the classical method where everybody learned in log cabins and became president and engineers before.
[03:35:32.172 --> 03:35:35.455]  And then the rest of the time they go out and have fun.
[03:35:35.455 --> 03:35:36.116]  Well, that's right.
[03:35:36.116 --> 03:35:46.864]  And you know, the Greeks didn't begin really formal schooling until about seven years of age because early on kids really do need the raw experience with nature.
[03:35:46.864 --> 03:35:51.828]  You know, they need to see frogs in a stream and not see a picture of a frog in a stream in a book.
[03:35:52.857 --> 03:35:58.881]  And they learn much more effectively that way early on, and it provides the raw material for subsequent analytics.
[03:35:58.881 --> 03:35:59.301]  That's right.
[03:35:59.301 --> 03:36:07.486]  Children need to be out very young, seeing people bale hay, planting gardens, fishing, boxing, you know, wrestling.
[03:36:07.486 --> 03:36:08.506]  That's what they need.
[03:36:08.506 --> 03:36:20.213]  Of course, a four-year-old can't understand those things analytically, and of course that's precisely why the government increasingly, you know, why it adopted the kindergarten model from Germany, which it ultimately came from Prussian militarism.
[03:36:21.036 --> 03:36:27.441]  And why they would like to go earlier and earlier and take the kids out of their families and put them in a concrete box all day.
[03:36:27.441 --> 03:36:29.862]  You don't learn anything in a concrete box at that age.
[03:36:29.862 --> 03:36:30.603]  You can't.
[03:36:30.603 --> 03:36:33.305]  Man, I'll tell you, Pat, you are just an amazing guy.
[03:36:33.305 --> 03:36:40.690]  I love generalists and everything you're saying is, you know, all the basic research I've done and many others have done.
[03:36:40.690 --> 03:36:41.911]  You're a multifaceted guy.
[03:36:41.911 --> 03:36:45.554]  I know a lot of people are, but it's really great to talk to somebody that really knows what's going on.
[03:36:46.004 --> 03:36:53.050]  Well, actually, I'm president of a national homeschool program, so it's an area I'm interested in.
[03:36:53.050 --> 03:37:00.736]  It's called the Great Books Academy, and it's on lions.org.
[03:37:00.736 --> 03:37:05.299]  So, yeah, it's an area I'm very interested in because it's part of the solution to this.
[03:37:05.299 --> 03:37:10.924]  The economic problem is, in fact, rooted in people not being able to understand what's happening to them.
[03:37:11.783 --> 03:37:14.585]  Let's take a few final calls.
[03:37:14.585 --> 03:37:15.426]  Who is up next here?
[03:37:15.426 --> 03:37:16.767]  I've got somebody on the list.
[03:37:16.767 --> 03:37:17.707]  Isaac in New York.
[03:37:17.707 --> 03:37:18.448]  Isaac in New York.
[03:37:18.448 --> 03:37:19.368]  You're on the air with our guest.
[03:37:19.368 --> 03:37:20.569]  Go ahead.
[03:37:20.569 --> 03:37:22.831]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[03:37:22.831 --> 03:37:24.552]  Hello?
[03:37:24.552 --> 03:37:26.553]  Yes, sir.
[03:37:26.553 --> 03:37:32.958]  I was calling because I heard you before on regard about the preachers getting the money to quell dissent.
[03:37:32.958 --> 03:37:41.504]  And I wanted to kind of bring light to a couple weeks ago I was at a church event and basically the preacher started relating
[03:37:42.259 --> 03:37:51.202]  A story about illegal immigration and how people were upset about losing jobs and complaining.
[03:37:51.202 --> 03:38:08.908]  And basically he went into a story about how a man had a field and he hired workers and some people started later in the day and at the end of the day they were upset because they got paid the same as the workers who started later.
[03:38:08.908 --> 03:38:10.129]  And I just thought it was weird.
[03:38:10.911 --> 03:38:14.674]  Look, there's a bunch of liberation, there's a bunch of liberation theology.
[03:38:14.674 --> 03:38:17.136]  We call it communism, but it's not.
[03:38:17.136 --> 03:38:23.942]  The banks fund this socialism, and they teach you turn your guns in.
[03:38:23.942 --> 03:38:25.523]  They've hired 26,000 preachers.
[03:38:25.523 --> 03:38:28.105]  We exposed this a year and a half before it was mainstream news.
[03:38:28.105 --> 03:38:30.107]  We got the secret FEMA documents from a pastor.
[03:38:30.107 --> 03:38:32.349]  Butch Paul did, and then we covered it here.
[03:38:32.349 --> 03:38:37.313]  And they have them, I mean, literally going off government scripts and being paid.
[03:38:37.313 --> 03:38:39.535]  And if that isn't total tyranny, I don't know what is, Pat.
[03:38:41.075 --> 03:38:51.285]  Well, obviously religion is a tremendously important source of inspiration, and ultimately it inspires political action, and they know that.
[03:38:51.285 --> 03:38:58.272]  So they're going to try to corrupt that just as they have the media, just as they have the educational system, the political system.
[03:38:58.272 --> 03:39:04.538]  So one has to keep one's eyes out for anything like that that is not
[03:39:05.819 --> 03:39:10.703]  You know, that raises one's eyebrows and doesn't match, you know, the truth.
[03:39:10.703 --> 03:39:13.665]  Yeah, folks, your children are the greatest treasure in the world.
[03:39:13.665 --> 03:39:15.567]  They teach you it's horrible to have children.
[03:39:15.567 --> 03:39:16.748]  They teach you it's a hassle.
[03:39:16.748 --> 03:39:18.469]  They teach you it's terrible.
[03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:21.892]  When really it's the best thing in the world and it's part of our life cycle.
[03:39:21.892 --> 03:39:24.113]  We're meant to be in families.
[03:39:24.113 --> 03:39:28.177]  And that's why the state, who wants the utopia, says they have to destroy the family first.
[03:39:28.177 --> 03:39:29.518]  And that's in all the government documents.
[03:39:29.518 --> 03:39:30.759]  It's total wickedness.
[03:39:30.759 --> 03:39:32.380]  The government is bankrupt and evil.
[03:39:32.660 --> 03:39:33.380]  Period.
[03:39:33.380 --> 03:39:34.801]  We have to come out of it.
[03:39:34.801 --> 03:39:36.681]  We have to create our own communities.
[03:39:36.681 --> 03:39:39.822]  We have to decentralize, not centralize.
[03:39:39.822 --> 03:39:41.762]  That is what is going to stop tyranny.
[03:39:41.762 --> 03:39:43.623]  That will never be a utopia.
[03:39:43.623 --> 03:39:45.543]  But I appreciate your call, Isaac.
[03:39:45.543 --> 03:39:46.543]  Scott in Arizona.
[03:39:46.543 --> 03:39:48.164]  And then we're going to let our guest go.
[03:39:48.164 --> 03:39:49.324]  Scott, go ahead.
[03:39:49.324 --> 03:39:50.424]  Actually, Scott dropped off.
[03:39:50.424 --> 03:39:51.025]  Chris in Toronto.
[03:39:51.025 --> 03:39:52.125]  Okay, Chris in Toronto.
[03:39:52.125 --> 03:39:52.425]  Go ahead.
[03:39:53.666 --> 03:39:54.186]  Hey, Alex.
[03:39:54.186 --> 03:39:54.807]  Good afternoon.
[03:39:54.807 --> 03:39:56.108]  Good afternoon to you and your guests.
[03:39:56.108 --> 03:39:57.028]  How are you guys doing today?
[03:39:57.028 --> 03:39:57.669]  Good.
[03:39:57.669 --> 03:39:58.109]  Great.
[03:39:58.109 --> 03:39:58.489]  Awesome.
[03:39:58.489 --> 03:39:59.010]  Awesome.
[03:39:59.010 --> 03:40:01.151]  I'm from Toronto, Canada, as you can tell.
[03:40:01.151 --> 03:40:02.612]  Pat, hello to you.
[03:40:02.612 --> 03:40:08.056]  What I'm concerned about, my question concerns in Canada right now, it's like the chickens are really coming home to roost.
[03:40:08.056 --> 03:40:11.198]  What happened in America happened like over the last few years or so.
[03:40:11.198 --> 03:40:17.622]  From your knowledge, how is that going to impact differently, or is it going to be somewhat comparative to the U.S.?
[03:40:17.622 --> 03:40:18.503]  What's happening in the U.S.
[03:40:18.503 --> 03:40:21.785]  right now in terms of the stock market going down, inflation?
[03:40:22.341 --> 03:40:31.125]  I mean, Canada has a lot of resources in terms of oil, water, timber, and we're more or less... Look, you have the same controllers that are going to do the same thing to you.
[03:40:31.125 --> 03:40:33.766]  It's the same global management system, Pat.
[03:40:33.766 --> 03:40:34.827]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[03:40:34.827 --> 03:40:38.448]  Your system's only trivially different.
[03:40:38.448 --> 03:40:45.372]  You know, one of the funny things about Canada lately is the bankers here say, oh, we abolished fractional reserve banking.
[03:40:45.372 --> 03:40:48.413]  And I looked at it, how can they say that because they still have fractional reserve
[03:40:48.840 --> 03:40:52.663]  Well, because they reduced the reserve requirement to zero.
[03:40:52.663 --> 03:41:00.149]  It's actually a worse form of banking because they don't require the banks to retain any reserves whatsoever.
[03:41:00.149 --> 03:41:01.430]  They just create it.
[03:41:01.430 --> 03:41:13.520]  By the way, the former head of the Treasury Policy analyzed the Banker Takeover Bill, known as the bailout, and he said it's clearly in there for no reserves now here, too.
[03:41:13.520 --> 03:41:15.061]  Yeah, well, they already have.
[03:41:15.061 --> 03:41:18.244]  There's a number of categories of loans, like euro currency loans.
[03:41:19.036 --> 03:41:23.199]  The first, I think it's $93 million in loans and so forth, where there's no reserves required.
[03:41:23.199 --> 03:41:30.064]  That's why about 98% of our money supply is created by the banks, not 90%.
[03:41:30.064 --> 03:41:30.944]  Absolutely.
[03:41:30.944 --> 03:41:32.545]  Anything else, caller?
[03:41:32.545 --> 03:41:34.327]  No, I just want to thank you personally.
[03:41:34.327 --> 03:41:39.190]  I understand just from listening to your radio show, I became new to the Truth Movement going back to February.
[03:41:39.190 --> 03:41:43.353]  And, you know, I hear you spilling your guts out in the air almost every single day.
[03:41:43.353 --> 03:41:45.754]  And I just want to let you know it's not without cause.
[03:41:45.754 --> 03:41:46.635]  You're waking people up.
[03:41:47.082 --> 03:41:52.083]  I mean, you have people in other nations that understand that America needs to be America.
[03:41:52.083 --> 03:41:52.863]  It cannot fall.
[03:41:52.863 --> 03:41:56.904]  The second America falls, I mean, everything else goes with it.
[03:41:56.904 --> 03:41:57.844]  Let me give you the news.
[03:41:57.844 --> 03:42:02.465]  We have fallen, and until we realize that, we've got to get it back.
[03:42:02.465 --> 03:42:04.285]  Fair enough, fair enough, but I'm an optimist.
[03:42:04.285 --> 03:42:06.325]  No, no, I hear you, I hear you, and God bless you.
[03:42:06.325 --> 03:42:08.946]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[03:42:08.946 --> 03:42:09.866]  Let me explain something.
[03:42:09.866 --> 03:42:14.667]  Let's say in Canada, somebody on their own gold mine, or land that gold was found on, or their own timber.
[03:42:15.785 --> 03:42:20.228]  That's what the environmental socialist movement's about, controlled by the banks, and they state this.
[03:42:20.228 --> 03:42:27.393]  Richard N. Haas, head of the CFR, states it in CFR and Club of Rome documents, particularly the 1991 documents.
[03:42:27.393 --> 03:42:34.538]  They selectively come and then sick the regulators on you and don't let you goldmine or don't let you cut timber or don't let you use your property.
[03:42:34.538 --> 03:42:37.360]  But then the big corporations... I mean, here's an example.
[03:42:37.360 --> 03:42:40.002]  You can pull up the numbers from more than a decade ago.
[03:42:40.002 --> 03:42:40.743]  Tyson Chicken,
[03:42:41.503 --> 03:42:52.286]  In Arkansas alone could have thousands, the number was 1,300, I remember from memory in the AP, 1,300 violations at one plant and they weren't shut down and were hardly fined.
[03:42:52.286 --> 03:42:58.208]  But then another independent separate chicken plant had something like six in a year and they were shut down.
[03:42:58.208 --> 03:43:01.309]  It's the same thing with beef packing, all of it.
[03:43:01.309 --> 03:43:03.450]  People think big corporations don't want regulations.
[03:43:03.450 --> 03:43:04.990]  The big boys do.
[03:43:04.990 --> 03:43:06.671]  Pat, in closing, can you explain that to them?
[03:43:07.847 --> 03:43:09.688]  Well, it's the power of money.
[03:43:09.688 --> 03:43:16.131]  Again, we've been talking most of the last hour about this vast concentration of wealth.
[03:43:16.131 --> 03:43:20.914]  And obviously, for instance, you know, these four major banks are talking about $8 trillion in assets.
[03:43:20.914 --> 03:43:32.440]  Well, they have four presidents, four men, not 4,000 or 400,000, make the ultimate decisions in those banks that affect hundreds of thousands of loans.
[03:43:32.440 --> 03:43:33.961]  I mean, that's incredible power.
[03:43:34.722 --> 03:43:38.283]  And so they, obviously, they're tempted to increase it.
[03:43:38.283 --> 03:43:39.463]  These are materialists.
[03:43:39.463 --> 03:43:41.724]  These aren't people highly motivated.
[03:43:41.724 --> 03:43:48.406]  There may be exceptions, but for the most part, they're certainly not highly motivated by religion or ethical values.
[03:43:48.406 --> 03:43:51.106]  They simply want to increase their power.
[03:43:51.106 --> 03:43:54.767]  And that's undeniable viewing what's happening right now.
[03:43:54.767 --> 03:43:58.448]  And so they use it to corrupt the political system.
[03:43:58.448 --> 03:44:00.909]  They corrupt the media by buying it.
[03:44:01.770 --> 03:44:03.331]  And that's what you're up against.
[03:44:03.331 --> 03:44:12.639]  So it's no wonder that it creeps down to the level of a small businessman being mistreated by the government and a large one getting away with all kinds of violations.
[03:44:13.132 --> 03:44:27.859]  All right, well, Pat Carmack, judge, former bank head, oil company owner, a lot of other great research that you bring to the table, and the producer of the Money Masters, the classic to understand what's happening.
[03:44:27.859 --> 03:44:29.279]  Everybody needs to see it.
[03:44:29.279 --> 03:44:33.801]  Available right now at InfoWars.com on DVD or call 888-253-3139.
[03:44:37.423 --> 03:44:48.990]  You can also go to themoneymasters.com and get the film and some of the things they offer there as well.
[03:44:48.990 --> 03:45:02.218]  Well, I really appreciate you coming on, Pat, and I want to have you back on in the near future to talk more about your monetary solution plan that you guys have come up with that I think is very, very important and needs to be looked at and is a serious option.
[03:45:02.218 --> 03:45:02.578]  Take care.
[03:45:03.308 --> 03:45:05.390]  Thank you for having me on, and I look forward to it.
[03:45:05.390 --> 03:45:05.850]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:45:05.850 --> 03:45:06.170]  You bet.
[03:45:06.170 --> 03:45:07.091]  Take care.
[03:45:07.091 --> 03:45:10.314]  That's a really classy guy, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:45:10.314 --> 03:45:11.695]  Worth quite a bit of cash.
[03:45:11.695 --> 03:45:12.195]  Y'all love it.
[03:45:12.195 --> 03:45:12.515]  What does he do?
[03:45:12.515 --> 03:45:14.517]  He goes and produces a film.
[03:45:14.517 --> 03:45:16.439]  Not to make money, because that's a pittance.
[03:45:16.439 --> 03:45:20.722]  I'm sure he's made to try to educate the public.
[03:45:20.722 --> 03:45:24.505]  Try to warn the people.
[03:45:24.505 --> 03:45:25.346]  And they made the film.
[03:45:27.954 --> 03:45:30.496]  In 1996 it came out.
[03:45:30.496 --> 03:45:32.817]  We're making it in 95.
[03:45:32.817 --> 03:45:36.499]  So it is 12 years old.
[03:45:36.499 --> 03:45:37.880]  And more important now.
[03:45:37.880 --> 03:45:38.681]  That's a classic.
[03:45:38.681 --> 03:45:41.662]  They call that evergreen in the media.
[03:45:41.662 --> 03:45:45.324]  And my books and videos and materials are evergreen.
[03:45:45.324 --> 03:45:46.085]  Why are they evergreen?
[03:45:46.085 --> 03:45:50.067]  Because with time, you're like, wow, was this just made yesterday?
[03:45:50.067 --> 03:45:51.088]  No, that was made 10 years ago.
[03:45:54.028 --> 03:45:56.310]  See, it's not prophecy.
[03:45:56.310 --> 03:45:58.031]  We know what the enemy is doing.
[03:45:58.031 --> 03:46:01.294]  We understand their program of control.
[03:46:01.294 --> 03:46:07.279]  So I do want to challenge the listeners to get the money masters.
[03:46:07.279 --> 03:46:11.002]  And I know most of you already know all about this, up one side and down the other.
[03:46:11.002 --> 03:46:13.764]  The general public doesn't.
[03:46:13.764 --> 03:46:15.585]  And they're now finally ready to listen.
[03:46:18.342 --> 03:46:21.564]  Please get Money Masters at InfoWars.com.
[03:46:21.564 --> 03:46:32.950]  Okay, I want to go over this financial news and this New Jersey stuff first, because there's been some big new developments there, and I want to go over that.
[03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:40.195]  But speaking of the free market, there are three sponsors that are making this show possible.
[03:46:40.195 --> 03:46:44.257]  We turned down a lot of sponsors, but these are the sponsors that we believe in and think are great.
[03:46:45.851 --> 03:46:50.055]  A Cola Blue, eFoods Direct, and Food Shortage USA.
[03:46:55.572 --> 03:46:57.333]  There's an atmospheric water generator for the home.
[03:46:57.333 --> 03:47:00.414]  Pays for itself within one year if you buy your water from the store.
[03:47:00.414 --> 03:47:01.895]  Pure clean water without the fluoride.
[03:47:01.895 --> 03:47:03.956]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[03:47:03.956 --> 03:47:05.617]  Know exactly what you're drinking.
[03:47:05.617 --> 03:47:07.658]  Machine produces up to 7.5 gallons a day.
[03:47:07.658 --> 03:47:10.299]  A minimum of about 3 gallons a day.
[03:47:10.299 --> 03:47:11.540]  Great tasting pure H2O.
[03:47:11.540 --> 03:47:12.820]  Exactly the way nature makes it.
[03:47:12.820 --> 03:47:14.341]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[03:47:14.341 --> 03:47:15.822]  Neutral pH.
[03:47:15.822 --> 03:47:21.505]  It passes through an active carbon filter, then a silver impregnated carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system, then a taste and
[03:47:22.305 --> 03:47:23.146]  We're good to go.
[03:47:37.546 --> 03:47:40.029]  And that complements efoodsdirect.com.
[03:47:40.029 --> 03:47:41.691]  Let's say everything's going to be wonderful.
[03:47:41.691 --> 03:47:49.639]  There's always a chance there could be a natural disaster, but we know there's more serious things like depression looming and massive food price increases because of hyperinflation.
[03:47:49.639 --> 03:47:53.863]  This food in a climate controlled area lasts more than 10 years.
[03:47:53.863 --> 03:47:58.708]  In a non-climate controlled, like your garage, 10 years.
[03:48:02.383 --> 03:48:08.426]  People can make fun of having storable food and getting ready, but it's... I care about my family, and I know I've done it.
[03:48:08.426 --> 03:48:10.387]  I know these are high quality folks.
[03:48:10.387 --> 03:48:11.067]  High quality food.
[03:48:11.067 --> 03:48:12.287]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[03:48:12.287 --> 03:48:14.888]  Big banners at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:48:14.888 --> 03:48:16.889]  And last but not least is Food Shortage USA.
[03:48:30.728 --> 03:48:42.440]  Just FoodShortage.com is the website that teaches you how to, on a weekly basis, the best kinds of foods to store, the ways to store food yourself, the way to can, the way to get prepared.
[03:48:42.440 --> 03:48:47.385]  Really great information at FoodShortageUSA.com or give them a call.
[03:48:48.546 --> 03:48:50.248]  to get the materials.
[03:48:50.248 --> 03:48:54.070]  They have a lot of great stuff available there.
[03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:56.172]  877-327-0365.
[03:48:56.172 --> 03:48:58.674]  Call that number to learn more.
[03:48:58.674 --> 03:49:00.135]  877-327-0365.
[03:49:00.135 --> 03:49:06.479]  Go to FoodShortageUSA.com.
[03:49:06.479 --> 03:49:14.665]  FoodShortageUSA.com to learn how to make your own storable foods for you and your family to prepare for the road ahead.
[03:49:15.984 --> 03:49:21.487]  The website reveals a step-by-step way for the average person to get prepared for what is clearly ahead.
[03:49:21.487 --> 03:49:27.410]  I think it's the best part of the system is that it gets you off the food grid, even if you don't have a lot of money to spend.
[03:49:27.410 --> 03:49:31.913]  The site is foodshortageusa.com.
[03:49:31.913 --> 03:49:34.895]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you will check that out.
[03:49:34.895 --> 03:49:40.478]  Okay, we're going to have five minutes when we come back, but it's going to be totally focused on this that I've been mentioning since the start of the show.
[03:49:41.874 --> 03:49:45.416]  Coming up in exactly 10 minutes, Ron Paul is on the show.
[03:49:45.416 --> 03:49:45.976]  Why is that?
[03:49:45.976 --> 03:49:55.942]  He was on at the very start of the show three hours and 15 minutes ago with key information about the economy and where it's all going.
[03:49:55.942 --> 03:49:58.684]  So after the break, we will get
[03:49:59.725 --> 03:50:03.208]  into New Jersey parents protest mandatory flu shots.
[03:50:03.208 --> 03:50:04.189]  And I'm proud.
[03:50:04.189 --> 03:50:07.892]  Where do we see a fair and balanced article exposing how this is a fraud?
[03:50:07.892 --> 03:50:09.753]  Because that is fair and balanced.
[03:50:09.753 --> 03:50:10.834]  It is a fraud.
[03:50:10.834 --> 03:50:12.075]  The Daily Texan.
[03:50:12.075 --> 03:50:15.258]  I mean, I'm seeing pretty good 9-11 inside job articles.
[03:50:15.258 --> 03:50:16.959]  I'm seeing stuff like this.
[03:50:16.959 --> 03:50:20.602]  And we know we've got a bunch of fans and people that have woken up over there.
[03:50:20.602 --> 03:50:23.624]  But then it dovetails with this USA Today article.
[03:50:23.624 --> 03:50:26.106]  Most health workers skip the flu shot.
[03:50:26.106 --> 03:50:28.088]  Most of them won't take it, but they'll make you take it.
[03:50:30.197 --> 03:50:34.699]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[03:50:34.699 --> 03:50:39.821]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:50:39.821 --> 03:50:41.322]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[03:50:41.322 --> 03:50:44.924]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[03:50:44.924 --> 03:50:50.326]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[03:50:50.326 --> 03:50:56.109]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[03:50:56.449 --> 03:50:58.951]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[03:50:58.951 --> 03:51:01.492]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[03:51:01.492 --> 03:51:03.893]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[03:51:03.893 --> 03:51:05.094]  No harsh chemicals.
[03:51:05.094 --> 03:51:06.295]  No animal testing.
[03:51:06.295 --> 03:51:07.636]  I use them and love them.
[03:51:07.636 --> 03:51:09.517]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.
[03:51:09.517 --> 03:51:10.937]  And I say big time.
[03:51:10.937 --> 03:51:12.658]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[03:51:12.658 --> 03:51:12.999]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[03:51:12.999 --> 03:51:15.380]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[03:51:22.404 --> 03:51:30.168]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[03:51:30.168 --> 03:51:31.609]  It is a big idea.
[03:51:31.609 --> 03:51:34.410]  A new world order.
[03:51:34.410 --> 03:51:39.293]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:51:39.293 --> 03:51:42.134]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:51:42.134 --> 03:51:44.916]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:51:44.916 --> 03:51:47.317]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:51:48.093 --> 03:51:55.431]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:51:58.447 --> 03:52:03.891]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:52:03.891 --> 03:52:07.753]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:52:07.753 --> 03:52:10.335]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[03:52:10.335 --> 03:52:11.496]  Most people have no idea.
[03:52:11.496 --> 03:52:12.276]  They're not after money.
[03:52:12.276 --> 03:52:13.557]  They have all the money they need.
[03:52:13.557 --> 03:52:14.538]  They're after power.
[03:52:14.538 --> 03:52:15.679]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:52:15.679 --> 03:52:24.424]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:24.424 --> 03:52:25.185]  Endgame.
[03:52:25.185 --> 03:52:27.206]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[03:52:27.206 --> 03:52:28.267]  You have been warned.
[03:52:29.548 --> 03:52:39.257]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[03:52:39.257 --> 03:52:42.520]  The whole country's on a bus with a crazy driver.
[03:52:42.520 --> 03:52:44.282]  If the passengers can't get hold of the wheel...
[03:52:44.636 --> 03:52:45.977]  We're all gonna go over the cliff.
[03:53:14.616 --> 03:53:14.816]  All right!
[03:53:44.608 --> 03:53:51.220]  You know, I talked at the start of the show about talking to a lady, a neighbor, who
[03:53:52.256 --> 03:53:57.559]  Her child was just talking in class, so they gave her a $500 ticket and said, no judge, no jury, use the ticket.
[03:53:57.559 --> 03:54:04.062]  And now they have the points program, where even if you're not convicted of it, people are getting $1,000 fines and things in the mail.
[03:54:04.062 --> 03:54:05.763]  I mean, the system is just completely corrupt.
[03:54:05.763 --> 03:54:08.765]  They're raising the money to put it in the private banks and the brokerage firms.
[03:54:08.765 --> 03:54:17.069]  The cities and counties take the vast majority of their money, over 60%, on a national average, with the CFRs, the coverage of annual financial reports.
[03:54:17.069 --> 03:54:17.790]  I'm trying to hurry here.
[03:54:18.650 --> 03:54:20.390]  And they invest.
[03:54:20.390 --> 03:54:21.731]  I mean, it's all gone.
[03:54:21.731 --> 03:54:23.411]  They're taking it all.
[03:54:23.411 --> 03:54:26.652]  And you understand, it's a criminal business now.
[03:54:26.652 --> 03:54:39.435]  Now, as if that isn't bad enough, in DC, it's a little private district of criminals, and in New Jersey, they are claiming that it's the law that you've got to take inoculations.
[03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:46.412]  They're claiming that you have to do it.
[03:54:46.412 --> 03:54:52.957]  And then even the vaccine groups are getting roped into this and going, well, no, we have a right to say no to mandatory shots.
[03:54:52.957 --> 03:54:58.081]  There is a waiver, but a waiver for a law that doesn't exist, even that is a fraud.
[03:54:58.081 --> 03:55:01.363]  The way they get you is the truancy clause.
[03:55:01.363 --> 03:55:04.265]  They say under policy you're kicked out of school.
[03:55:04.265 --> 03:55:07.948]  They don't tell you by law they've got to give you the waiver.
[03:55:07.948 --> 03:55:12.792]  But the whole issue is now they've listed in the advertising news, it's the law, everybody's got to take the flu shot.
[03:55:16.570 --> 03:55:21.693]  Which for those that don't know, the last six years they haven't even gotten the flu right.
[03:55:21.693 --> 03:55:24.134]  They're always guessing the year before how it's going to mutate.
[03:55:24.134 --> 03:55:27.756]  It's filled with mercury, still in there, very dangerous.
[03:55:27.756 --> 03:55:29.617]  The flu shots admittedly have killed a lot of people.
[03:55:31.778 --> 03:55:38.300]  A flu season approaches, many New Jersey parents are furious over a first-in-the-nation requirement that children get a flu shot.
[03:55:38.300 --> 03:55:42.261]  Just like Texas was first-in-the-nation, girls have to take the HPV.
[03:55:42.261 --> 03:55:43.462]  But there was no law.
[03:55:43.462 --> 03:55:47.603]  They just listed it in the state health department as recommended, and the schools then say it's mandatory.
[03:55:47.603 --> 03:55:48.923]  No law!
[03:55:48.923 --> 03:55:50.344]  But people don't know that!
[03:55:51.235 --> 03:55:54.517]  Requirement that children get a flu shot in order to attend preschools and daycare centers.
[03:55:54.517 --> 03:55:56.477]  The decision should be the parents, not the states.
[03:55:56.477 --> 03:55:58.458]  They continued.
[03:55:58.458 --> 03:56:11.665]  So see, it's just like they could never pass the Animal ID and Primus Society to take over farms and ranches, but they ordered the 4-H club and all the other clubs to just not tell people and then kick them out of farm shows, livestock shows.
[03:56:11.665 --> 03:56:14.166]  They have police escort them off like they're criminals.
[03:56:14.166 --> 03:56:17.908]  Again, they know the public's ignorant, and so they engage in this racketeering.
[03:56:17.908 --> 03:56:18.668]  It's racketeering.
[03:56:20.441 --> 03:56:27.427]  Now if that isn't bad enough, and I'm going to get some guests on about this next week, and of course I'll be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:56:27.427 --> 03:56:30.229]  Central with the abbreviated Sunday 2 hour show.
[03:56:30.229 --> 03:56:34.492]  But USA Today, most health workers skip flu shot.
[03:56:34.492 --> 03:56:37.134]  And here is the article.
[03:56:37.134 --> 03:56:44.220]  Remember when they claimed it was mandatory that all the health workers have to take the smallpox shot and 90 plus percent refused?
[03:56:46.067 --> 03:56:49.851]  According to USA Today, it was the same publication in the LA Times back then.
[03:56:49.851 --> 03:56:56.338]  It was 4,000 out of 14 million first responders.
[03:56:56.338 --> 03:56:58.320]  Most health workers skip flu shot.
[03:56:58.320 --> 03:57:04.666]  Operating room nurse Paula Taylor knows her refusal to get a flu shot is based on faulty logic.
[03:57:04.666 --> 03:57:07.389]  So it goes on to say, oh she admits she's an idiot.
[03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:08.130]  No, no she doesn't.
[03:57:09.721 --> 03:57:14.182]  But ever since she got sick after getting a shot a few years ago, she's sworn off the vaccine.
[03:57:14.182 --> 03:57:14.862]  I rarely get sick.
[03:57:14.862 --> 03:57:17.803]  The only thing I could narrow it down to was I had gotten this shot.
[03:57:17.803 --> 03:57:22.784]  Well, of course, it kills a lot of people, said Taylor, who works for the University Hospital at clinics in Iowa City.
[03:57:22.784 --> 03:57:24.284]  I know that it's not a live virus.
[03:57:24.284 --> 03:57:26.845]  It just seemed pretty coincidental.
[03:57:26.845 --> 03:57:29.806]  Such stories frustrate Dr. William Schaefer.
[03:57:29.806 --> 03:57:31.766]  So they treat us like we're a bunch of idiots.
[03:57:31.766 --> 03:57:33.487]  We won't take it.
[03:57:33.487 --> 03:57:34.687]  You know, you're dumb.
[03:57:35.851 --> 03:57:39.093]  I mean, the swine flu shots killed tens of thousands.
[03:57:39.093 --> 03:57:40.553]  I mean, it kills people.
[03:57:40.553 --> 03:57:42.754]  HPV's killing people.
[03:57:42.754 --> 03:57:46.776]  That's in the CDC, but they have articles about crazy people thinking it might be bad for them.
[03:57:46.776 --> 03:57:50.758]  They're just backwoods knuckle-dragger idiots.
[03:57:50.758 --> 03:57:54.780]  So, it goes on to say the majority of them in here won't take it.
[03:57:56.172 --> 03:57:59.773]  Then they try to threaten parents with taking their children, and they don't when there's no law.
[03:57:59.773 --> 03:58:00.473]  We're out of time.
[03:58:00.473 --> 03:58:02.333]  Rebroadcast with Ron Paul right now.
[03:58:02.333 --> 03:58:07.435]  He was on at the very start of the show, only one place, the streams at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:07.435 --> 03:58:09.975]  See you live Sunday.
[03:58:09.975 --> 03:58:12.496]  Thank you for listening.
[03:58:12.496 --> 03:58:13.576]  Great job, Jones.
[03:58:13.576 --> 03:58:14.076]  Great job.
[03:58:14.076 --> 03:58:15.116]  Appreciate you, Bubba.
[03:58:15.116 --> 03:58:18.897]  The CDC, they have articles about crazy people, think it might be bad for them.
[03:58:18.897 --> 03:58:21.178]  They're just backwoods knuckle-dragger idiots.
[03:58:22.887 --> 03:58:28.353]  So, he goes on to say the majority of them in here won't take it.
[03:58:28.353 --> 03:58:31.376]  Then they try to threaten parents with taking their children, and they don't when there's no law.
[03:58:31.376 --> 03:58:32.597]  We're out of time.
[03:58:32.597 --> 03:58:34.460]  Rebroadcast with Ron Paul right now.

[03:58:39.585 --> 03:58:40.927]  See you live Sunday.
