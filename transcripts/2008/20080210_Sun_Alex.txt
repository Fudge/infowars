[00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:27.715]  Call free.
[00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:30.855]  Hello ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:35.558]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:35.578 --> 00:00:36.058]  We're live.
[00:00:36.138 --> 00:00:45.564]  It is already the 11th day.
[00:01:00.288 --> 00:01:01.309]  Or is it the 10th today?
[00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.852]  I can't keep track anymore.
[00:01:04.953 --> 00:01:05.813]  I'll tell you what's happened.
[00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:07.515]  I'm incredibly frustrated right now.
[00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:13.481]  I had found about 10 different news clips from around the U.S.
[00:01:16.664 --> 00:01:22.249]  Just the last three or four hours today before I came up here, a local newscast showing police training
[00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:31.829]  To round up Americans and put us in camps and to ride us down with horses and to fire on us with the sound guns and microwave cannons.
[00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:45.857]  I found a bunch of clips that I'd never seen before doing deep searches on YouTube and Google and I had noticed that my printer wasn't printing the articles because I was going to bring them down here and have them put clips of it in the computer so we could play it on air.
[00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:52.765]  And then, right before I came down here, I noticed that the whole computer just crashed.
[00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:53.485]  It just died.
[00:01:54.066 --> 00:02:04.491]  I called the Apple Store and they said that, uh, that AppleCare, and they said, well, we have Macs and PCs at my house, and they said, uh, oh, that just means your computer's completely fried.
[00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:06.852]  It's not connected to the hard drive.
[00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:14.036]  And so, right up until about ten seconds before I came on air, I was trying to find these clips again, and guess what?
[00:02:14.096 --> 00:02:15.237]  I couldn't find them again.
[00:02:15.257 --> 00:02:17.258]  And it made me really mad.
[00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:27.815]  So I'm in a really bad mood right now, and just as I came on air, I thought, oh, and it might be nice if I can tell people what day it is.
[00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:28.735]  What day is it?
[00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:31.015]  Yeah, it's the 10th.
[00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:31.836]  Okay, I was right then.
[00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:42.259]  It's the 10th day of February 2008, and at a certain point, I mean, at a certain point, there's not even a reason to be here.
[00:02:45.151 --> 00:03:04.964]  They're spying on us, and the borders are wide open, and they're putting up face-scanning cameras everywhere, and reading our license plates, and... I've been in the urban warfare drills for a decade with the police and military trained together to take our children away from us and put us in concentration camps, and I've made films about it, and I was really thinking today, why am I even coming in here to play these clips to people?
[00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:06.985]  Why am I even trying to prove this to you?
[00:03:09.407 --> 00:03:12.229]  Creeping evil going on all around us.
[00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:17.079]  And I just personally am sick of it.
[00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.581]  I am sick and tired of everything that's happening in our society.
[00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:30.007]  Of course, the good news is that a lot of people are becoming aware of what's going on.
[00:03:30.887 --> 00:03:33.389]  I don't know if people are waking up fast enough to what's happening.
[00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.331]  I mean, these are the type of articles I have.
[00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:40.994]  At least randomly swabbing people for DNA databases.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.210]  FBI deputizes private contractors with extraordinary powers including shoot-to-kill orders for martial law.
[00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:57.400]  Department of Homeland Security official says you'll need a national ID card to buy cold medicine, total federalization of our lives.
[00:04:00.922 --> 00:04:04.825]  The British government has now been caught spying on Members of Parliament.
[00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:06.446]  They just spy on the Members of Parliament.
[00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:08.587]  Of course, our government spies on Congress, too.
[00:04:08.827 --> 00:04:09.688]  It's not our government.
[00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:16.272]  It's just private intelligence agencies that are totally criminal that work for the big private central banks that own and run this country.
[00:04:18.754 --> 00:04:19.854]  It is really that simple.
[00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:23.437]  People say I freak out, I yell and scream, I get upset.
[00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:35.125]  You go to an urban warfare drill, and you watch Marines training to take your guns, and the role players they've hired, the actors they've hired, are saying they're Americans, and the Marines will admit, they're trained to do this right here in America!
[00:04:36.766 --> 00:04:43.151]  And then I've got mainstream news reports now, but the reports are saying it's good, and that it's a good thing.
[00:04:43.212 --> 00:04:45.193]  No, folks, it's not a good thing.
[00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:50.237]  And this whole thing is being shut up.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.640]  This whole
[00:04:54.258 --> 00:05:01.281]  That system is being set up for the American people.
[00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:03.902]  I mean, you go to the drills, you go to the training, it's about us.
[00:05:04.522 --> 00:05:06.163]  It's about the citizens of this country.
[00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:13.386]  Newscast after newscast today I found, and I'm going to find them, you better believe, you're going to hear them here next week.
[00:05:15.326 --> 00:05:19.268]  Newscast after... I mean, I've actually found some, but these are old ones we play.
[00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:21.709]  I found a bunch of new ones and it really upset me.
[00:05:23.368 --> 00:05:31.051]  That all over the country, the military and the police, to just absolutely enslave the American people.
[00:05:36.232 --> 00:05:37.013]  It's upsetting to me.
[00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:42.134]  And at a certain point, frankly, I just get sick of talking about it.
[00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:45.035]  At a certain point, I'm just disgusted.
[00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:47.596]  And I wish there was some free country I could go to.
[00:05:47.976 --> 00:05:50.377]  But the whole world is falling under this New World Order.
[00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:52.838]  The whole world is being swallowed up by this.
[00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.911]  And it's a very upsetting situation.
[00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:09.796]  At the end of the day, just to realize that no matter whatever else is going good in my life, I've got these criminals running the government that are literally leering over me and my whole family and you, even if you don't know it.
[00:06:13.237 --> 00:06:16.018]  And then I see just the ignorance of people politically.
[00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.840]  John McCain has 800 and something delegates.
[00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:24.402]  Ron Paul has less than 50 delegates.
[00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:35.293]  McCain only needs 1,100 and change to lock up the Republican nomination.
[00:06:37.514 --> 00:06:43.115]  And John McCain is pro-gun control, pro-open borders.
[00:06:43.616 --> 00:06:50.978]  He has a voting record, not his rhetoric, but his voting record, quote, as big government and liberal, statist, whatever you want to call it, as Hillary Clinton.
[00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:54.539]  His whole war record's fake, on the face of it.
[00:06:57.489 --> 00:07:08.153]  And then Ron Paul comes out Friday, and we'll read you his statement here on air, and a lot of Ron Paul supporters can't even understand what he's saying when it's in clear English.
[00:07:10.694 --> 00:07:13.455]  So, we'll go over that today as well.
[00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:17.057]  I mean, we get so focused, though, on the presidential campaigns.
[00:07:18.377 --> 00:07:19.758]  We get 50-60% turnout on average.
[00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:33.835]  50-60% turnout for presidential elections, the big dog and pony show, but 8% locally.
[00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:36.477]  And it happens throughout history.
[00:07:36.537 --> 00:07:37.598]  It happens all the time.
[00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:38.239]  It's the norm.
[00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.620]  I'm here to give you the newsflash.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.641]  Criminals took over your government.
[00:07:42.181 --> 00:07:52.569]  And they've got a bunch of well-meaning, dumbed-down saps that run the system and who are compartmentalized, and most of them think they're doing a good thing.
[00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:53.589]  They're too dumb.
[00:07:53.609 --> 00:07:55.451]  And then there's this toady society.
[00:07:55.471 --> 00:07:57.152]  I mean, I've got all these newscasts where they're
[00:07:57.563 --> 00:08:01.885]  Training the kids to tattle on their parents and just the Stasi society.
[00:08:01.905 --> 00:08:02.905]  It just makes me sick.
[00:08:04.766 --> 00:08:07.026]  It makes me sick that it's gone this far.
[00:08:10.147 --> 00:08:15.189]  So we'll open the phones up today and get your take on Ron Paul, where that campaign's going from here.
[00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.091]  We will also get into some good news.
[00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:22.852]  Last Monday I interviewed Willie Nelson.
[00:08:26.112 --> 00:08:30.473]  And I'll tell you how that came about and also play a ten-minute clip of the hour-long interview I did with him.
[00:08:30.913 --> 00:08:34.593]  Mr. Nelson came on and talked about how he believes 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:08:34.613 --> 00:08:39.734]  He also talked about how he believes the government is setting up for martial law.
[00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:47.496]  So it's great to know that Willie Nelson has been a listener for many years and that Willie Nelson is a supporter of the show.
[00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:52.617]  I actually knew that a few months ago, but I wasn't going to go on air and talk about it because it just sounded unbelievable.
[00:08:53.897 --> 00:08:54.997]  And so we'll just
[00:08:55.663 --> 00:08:58.104]  Play him actually saying it and talking about it.
[00:08:58.164 --> 00:09:05.008]  So, there are a lot of prominent people behind the scenes I've met and gotten a chance to talk to who are very informed about what's going on, but they're too afraid to go public.
[00:09:05.488 --> 00:09:09.050]  Like Mr. Nelson and others have who are prominent.
[00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.271]  People say, well who cares what a celebrity has to say?
[00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:16.094]  Well, you know, everybody cares what a celebrity has to say about what beer they drink or what boots they wear.
[00:09:19.574 --> 00:09:23.335]  If it's controversial against the government and the media says, we don't want to hear what a celebrity has to say.
[00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:28.537]  Well, he's an accomplished musician, film actor, and icon, so it is news.
[00:09:29.638 --> 00:09:31.459]  I mean, plus, people don't ignore Willie Nelson.
[00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:38.021]  They ignore former prime ministers, presidents, heads of CIA sections, saying 9-11's an inside job.
[00:09:40.282 --> 00:09:42.903]  So Willie put himself out there for ridicule to try to wake you up.
[00:09:43.655 --> 00:09:44.416]  That's coming up, too.
[00:09:44.436 --> 00:09:45.677]  Stay with us.
[00:09:45.757 --> 00:09:47.178]  It is a big idea.
[00:09:47.198 --> 00:09:48.339]  A new world order.
[00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:52.762]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[00:09:53.242 --> 00:09:55.584]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:10:12.964 --> 00:10:15.086]  Both their objectives being world domination.
[00:10:15.767 --> 00:10:18.189]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:26.337]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.245]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:10:34.745 --> 00:10:38.006]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:10:38.026 --> 00:10:41.107]  Bill and Fergus make great progress toward a world government.
[00:10:41.147 --> 00:10:42.307]  Most people have no idea.
[00:10:42.327 --> 00:10:43.087]  They're not after money.
[00:10:43.107 --> 00:10:44.168]  They have all the money they need.
[00:10:44.388 --> 00:10:45.148]  They're after power.
[00:10:45.348 --> 00:10:46.368]  That's what they're after.

[00:10:57.992 --> 00:10:59.112]  You have been warned.
[00:11:00.004 --> 00:11:00.545]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:06.369]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:12.715]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[00:11:13.482 --> 00:11:16.743]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[00:11:17.404 --> 00:11:20.665]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[00:11:21.285 --> 00:11:24.667]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[00:11:25.267 --> 00:11:29.769]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[00:11:30.509 --> 00:11:32.490]  We will still have two regrets.
[00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.471]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[00:11:37.152 --> 00:11:40.013]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[00:11:40.788 --> 00:11:47.673]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:48.693]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:49.814]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:49.874]  800-409-5633.
[00:12:01.565 --> 00:12:03.506]  Hi, John Heumann from Midas Resources.
[00:12:03.786 --> 00:12:06.407]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:12:06.707 --> 00:12:15.011]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:12:15.331 --> 00:12:18.153]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:12:18.993 --> 00:12:22.195]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:12:23.515 --> 00:12:25.096]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:12:25.496 --> 00:12:26.417]  Take action now!
[00:12:26.557 --> 00:12:30.460]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.143]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:12:35.363 --> 00:12:38.565]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:12:38.685 --> 00:12:45.110]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.711]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:49.192]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.

[00:13:00.609 --> 00:13:02.091]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.

[00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.430]  We're good to go.

[00:14:19.197 --> 00:14:26.203]  Some of the news I'm going to be covering right now.
[00:14:26.364 --> 00:14:32.729]  Paul concedes race, sort of, is the New York Times headline.
[00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:38.435]  Probably a hundred other papers had... I literally scanned through like 50 of them last night.
[00:14:38.495 --> 00:14:40.076]  I just went on and on saying the same thing.
[00:14:40.416 --> 00:14:42.058]  Ron Paul drops out on and on.
[00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:46.676]  Well, let's just go ahead and read you what Ron Paul actually said.
[00:14:46.716 --> 00:14:53.000]  They have excerpts out of the New York Times, or you can go to the Ron Paul website, the Presidential Run website, and read it for yourself.
[00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:59.524]  Paul concedes, sort of, in a message a supporter sent out just before 11 p.m.
[00:14:59.544 --> 00:14:59.964]  Friday night.
[00:14:59.984 --> 00:15:06.188]  Representative Ron Paul, a long-shot GOP candidate from Texas, basically conceded that he's not going to win the primary nomination.
[00:15:06.508 --> 00:15:08.910]  That said, he's scaling back his campaign, but not entirely.
[00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:09.450]  He said,
[00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:13.110]  With Romney gone, the chances of a broker convention are nearly zero.
[00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.851]  I kept telling people that last week and they just wouldn't believe me.
[00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:23.913]  But that does not affect my determination to fight on in every caucus and primary, remaining at the convention for our ideas.
[00:15:24.533 --> 00:15:36.657]  See, that means to, in debates and events, to be there and inject the anti-war view, the explaining that the private banks have devalued the dollar, the North American Union, things like that.
[00:15:37.498 --> 00:15:45.626]  With just as many delegates as I can get, but with so many primaries and caucuses now over, we do not need so big a national campaign step.
[00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:47.848]  So I am making it leaner and tighter.
[00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:53.995]  In the New York Times comments, Mr. Paul clearly stated that he will not run as a third-party candidate right now.
[00:15:54.275 --> 00:15:59.000]  His priorities are serving the residents in his Texas congressional district and winning re-election.
[00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:01.031]  This is from Ron Paul.
[00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:10.013]  If I were to lose the primary for my congressional seat, all our opponents would react with glee and pretend it was a rejection of our ideas.
[00:16:11.173 --> 00:16:12.734]  And the New York Times goes on from there.
[00:16:12.994 --> 00:16:22.796]  From what we can make of that letter, Mr. Paul is staying in the race on a periphery level so he can keep participating in policy discussions.
[00:16:24.256 --> 00:16:26.877]  And they went on to add, and maybe use up all the money he's amassed.
[00:16:27.512 --> 00:16:31.135]  In the presidential race and the congressional race, I need your support, Paul says.
[00:16:31.595 --> 00:16:38.080]  As always, Mr. Paul wrote, and I have plans to continue fighting for our ideas in politics and education.
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.403]  I will share with you when I can, for I will need you at my side.
[00:16:42.443 --> 00:16:49.788]  In the meantime, onward and upward, the neocons, the warmongers, the socialists, the advocates of inflation will be hearing from you and me.
[00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:50.989]  Okay.
[00:16:52.079 --> 00:17:00.285]  We have a story up on PrisonPlanet.com, why Ron Paul has all but suspended his presidential campaign.
[00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:04.509]  Now, let me basically explain what that means.
[00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:06.390]  Let me basically go through that.
[00:17:10.213 --> 00:17:12.515]  Brokered conventions, we haven't had one since 1948.
[00:17:13.376 --> 00:17:16.598]  Each state has a number of delegates.
[00:17:17.139 --> 00:17:18.580]  Some of you, I know, understand this.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.541]  Some of us don't.
[00:17:20.221 --> 00:17:21.382]  So let me just be basic.
[00:17:21.826 --> 00:17:27.489]  The primaries are where the Democrats try to pick their candidate and they have a battle nationwide, state by state.
[00:17:28.009 --> 00:17:31.631]  And then you have the Republican primaries where they battle it out.
[00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:38.254]  Okay, now if McCain gets a little over 1,100 delegates, he has it locked.
[00:17:39.834 --> 00:17:41.095]  Right now he has more than 800.
[00:17:43.276 --> 00:17:46.598]  Ron Paul has less than 50 right now.
[00:17:47.378 --> 00:17:48.238]  So you do the math.
[00:17:48.298 --> 00:17:48.939]  Ron Paul has 50.
[00:17:50.675 --> 00:17:55.098]  McCain has 800, he's only a couple hundred away from locking it up.
[00:17:58.099 --> 00:18:09.446]  Now, a broker convention would be, let's say Ron Paul had 700 and something delegates, and McCain had 800 and something delegates, a close race.
[00:18:10.127 --> 00:18:18.171]  Then, they would try to have a broker convention, where if you can't get the number you need to go over that 1100 mark,
[00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:36.634]  Then you have a battle where they fight over delegates and where there's this exchange and where I guess Ron Paul delegates would try to go and get people to switch over to John McCain or fill those places.
[00:18:37.694 --> 00:18:43.836]  That can only happen in close elections and when it has happened in the last hundred years
[00:18:44.699 --> 00:18:45.599]  And it hadn't happened in over 50.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.801]  The media jumps on whoever doesn't have the majority of the delegates and acts like they're trying to steal the election.
[00:18:51.282 --> 00:18:55.503]  So, there will be no brokered convention, and Ron Paul has now told you that.
[00:18:55.944 --> 00:18:58.965]  He said nearly zero chance of a brokered convention.
[00:19:01.286 --> 00:19:04.207]  It's like we're generals here, commanding armies that don't exist.
[00:19:06.128 --> 00:19:10.029]  It just isn't reality-based, and I refuse to be part of Kool-Aid drinking behavior.
[00:19:10.529 --> 00:19:10.830]  Okay?
[00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.391]  Now, let's expand out onto that.
[00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.191]  Ron Paul could run third party.
[00:19:17.211 --> 00:19:22.735]  The only shot he has now, the only shot he had, was to start running for third party.
[00:19:22.775 --> 00:19:29.000]  He has the infrastructure, he has the grassroots, he has the proven money-raising capacity to do it.
[00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:39.869]  And talking to the head of the campaign, Kent Schneider, two weeks ago, he said they were considering it, after they saw what happened in Super Tuesday.
[00:19:42.305 --> 00:19:54.416]  Suddenly, last week, I was interviewing his communications director, Jesse Benton, during the weekday show, and he said that they're not looking at a third party.
[00:19:54.476 --> 00:19:55.617]  That wasn't going to happen.
[00:19:55.757 --> 00:19:56.818]  I thought, that's interesting.
[00:19:57.039 --> 00:20:00.462]  From higher up the chain, we were getting noises from Ron Paul and Kent Snyder.
[00:20:00.702 --> 00:20:01.483]  They were considering it.
[00:20:02.103 --> 00:20:02.704]  And he said, well,
[00:20:04.375 --> 00:20:12.643]  We're now focusing a lot on the Congressional seat, where there's been a lot of treachery and big Republican machine, and people that said they wouldn't run against him are now doing that.
[00:20:12.683 --> 00:20:14.645]  The mayor down there in Texas City.
[00:20:17.427 --> 00:20:20.510]  Down by Galveston, where about half his district is located.
[00:20:22.592 --> 00:20:24.434]  That is, half the people in his district are located.
[00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:25.375]  It's all gerrymandered.
[00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.871]  And he's now in a tough fight down there.
[00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:37.374]  So, if Ron Paul runs as an Independent, the Republican Party can throw him out, and then he'd have to run for his Congressional seat as an Independent.
[00:20:38.394 --> 00:20:44.856]  Texas has the LBJ law that he put in for himself, where you can run for House or Senate while you're running for President.
[00:20:47.777 --> 00:20:48.838]  Because he did that once.
[00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:51.939]  There's only two states you can do it, and one of them's Texas.
[00:20:52.489 --> 00:21:00.472]  But if Ron Paul goes into a third party, he then has to run simultaneously for Congress in a third party, and it is a dangerous move to do.
[00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:02.453]  So he's taking the safe bet.
[00:21:02.933 --> 00:21:13.398]  He is going for his congressional seat, trying to win that, but he does have close to $8 million reportedly left, and so he wants to try to spend that.
[00:21:14.216 --> 00:21:15.577]  And see what happens.
[00:21:15.617 --> 00:21:25.085]  I mean, it could come out tomorrow that McCain, this is a long shot, you know, that McCain's got some dirt on him, and we know about Keating 5 and the mob and the rest of it, but he had been in trouble for that.
[00:21:25.106 --> 00:21:34.494]  We know about him being an anti-gun guy and pro-open border, but Kool-Aid drinking neoconservatives, that's, I mean, we've got Limbaugh and Ann Coulter endorsing
[00:21:35.959 --> 00:21:38.901]  Hillary now, so I mean, I told you for years you'd see that happen.
[00:21:39.221 --> 00:21:44.004]  Fox News, Roger Ailes, they've all been having fundraisers for her for five, six years, I've been telling you that.
[00:21:44.644 --> 00:21:46.606]  People are now got their mouths hanging open watching it.
[00:21:47.546 --> 00:21:50.228]  Limbaugh and Coulter are now trying to back off and say they were joking.
[00:21:50.248 --> 00:21:50.968]  They weren't joking.
[00:21:52.009 --> 00:21:54.931]  Are those jokes when the White House helps write Hillary's speeches?
[00:21:57.052 --> 00:21:58.613]  Is that jokes when they're advising her?
[00:21:58.693 --> 00:21:59.934]  They're all CIA folks.
[00:22:01.218 --> 00:22:05.682]  Cord Meyer, CIA section chief out of England, recruited Hillary and Bill in 1968.
[00:22:06.222 --> 00:22:07.003]  We have the documents.
[00:22:09.625 --> 00:22:10.446]  It's a staged deal.
[00:22:12.768 --> 00:22:19.193]  And the only primary that isn't basically cinched up now is Democratic.
[00:22:19.834 --> 00:22:24.478]  And Hillary's leading with delegates, but in money Obama's leading, but Hillary is the anointed one.
[00:22:25.759 --> 00:22:26.660]  So we'll see what happens.
[00:22:27.483 --> 00:22:33.024]  I'm going to continue to break this down and we're going to go to Neil, Clint, Mark, Andrew, Steve, and many others at 877-590-5525.
[00:22:33.044 --> 00:22:37.605]  Yeah, these are just the facts.
[00:22:38.706 --> 00:22:40.046]  And that's why people tune into this show.
[00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:43.047]  As Ron Paul supporters, I know you don't want to hear bull.
[00:22:44.027 --> 00:22:50.689]  I am hearing quite a lot of bull from talk show hosts and others that claim to be supporters of Ron Paul, and they're just, they're defeating you online.
[00:22:51.629 --> 00:22:52.189]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:00.563 --> 00:23:08.967]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:23:09.267 --> 00:23:14.950]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:21.733]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:23:22.353 --> 00:23:25.656]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:23:25.756 --> 00:23:27.977]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:06.458]  Now that we are in the midst of the presidential primaries, Republican candidate Ron Paul needs our support more than ever.
[00:24:06.858 --> 00:24:12.842]  Ron Paul stands for the issues that need to be addressed and not glossed over and forgotten like the globalist crowd being fielded.
[00:24:13.203 --> 00:24:19.527]  Unlike other candidates, Ron Paul takes a stand to follow what our forefathers envisioned America to be through the Constitution.
[00:24:19.547 --> 00:24:26.632]  Dr. Paul will restore sound money, eliminate the IRS, prevent the NAU, get us back to our constitutional roots,
[00:24:26.972 --> 00:24:27.393]  We're good.
[00:24:42.586 --> 00:24:42.946]  I think so.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.902]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:25:02.222 --> 00:25:05.665]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:07.747]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:25:07.887 --> 00:25:11.030]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:25:11.371 --> 00:25:16.856]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:25:17.136 --> 00:25:21.080]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.344]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:26:25.924 --> 00:26:27.645]  Only $249 plus shipping and handling and we'll ship
[00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:34.870]  I think so.
[00:27:05.928 --> 00:27:20.217]  You know, we asked Ross Ball to run more than a year ago, against overwhelming odds.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.200]  He did run.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.561]  He's put up an amazing fight.
[00:27:32.021 --> 00:27:42.445]  He's going to fight on in the primaries for ideas to inject real issues into the debate to show how the Republicans and Democrats are lockstep behind their globalist corporate masters.
[00:27:44.005 --> 00:27:53.468]  He needs to fend his congressional seat from right here in Texas as well so that he can represent the tens of millions of people that have woken up into the political process.
[00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:57.770]  That's the bottom line.
[00:28:00.649 --> 00:28:08.992]  Now I'm going to take a bunch of your calls and I'm going to get back into the basic analysis of what Ron Paul has done, what he has announced, and the facts.
[00:28:09.893 --> 00:28:12.994]  There is going to be no broker convention with Ron Paul.
[00:28:13.634 --> 00:28:14.634]  He said that himself.
[00:28:15.775 --> 00:28:27.559]  Then the only avenue he had left, he's got 50 delegates or less, and McCain's got 800 and something, he only needs to get 1100 and something.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.320]  Go look at the numbers for yourself.
[00:28:30.678 --> 00:28:31.058]  Okay?
[00:28:31.418 --> 00:28:37.059]  So if he isn't going to run third party, then very soon he'll be out of this race.
[00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:40.400]  But he intends to stay in it all the way to the convention so he can be part of the convention.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.440]  And that's fine and dandy.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.601]  But we're just reporting the facts here.
[00:28:45.981 --> 00:28:50.802]  And frankly, the New York Times is reporting the facts when they say Paul concedes race, sort of.
[00:28:51.442 --> 00:28:55.443]  That's what every other political analyst that looked at this came away from it with.
[00:28:55.503 --> 00:28:56.163]  In fact, you know what?
[00:28:56.863 --> 00:28:58.003]  I know we got loaded phone lines.
[00:28:58.516 --> 00:29:03.217]  And I'm going to go to everybody, but let me just go ahead and read this article now, or should I get to it after I take calls?
[00:29:04.298 --> 00:29:08.419]  Because I think the article that Paul Watson and I wrote yesterday breaks it down best.
[00:29:08.439 --> 00:29:11.700]  Yeah, let me just do that now, instead of keeping people hanging there.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.301]  Why has Ron Paul all but suspended his presidential campaign?
[00:29:15.801 --> 00:29:20.343]  Congressman makes a shrewd decision to safeguard amazing progress made by retaining congressional seat.
[00:29:21.163 --> 00:29:24.584]  So we need to be talking now about how to keep the Ron Paul revolution
[00:29:25.214 --> 00:29:34.481]  The thousands of meet-up groups, the hundreds of thousands of people that are in them, all the MySpace accounts, all the organizations, the grassroots, the record fundraising mechanisms.
[00:29:34.521 --> 00:29:35.722]  How do we keep that going?
[00:29:36.402 --> 00:29:40.725]  How do we continue and take this huge grassroots movement and fight the North American Union with it?
[00:29:41.906 --> 00:29:52.394]  Congressman Ron Paul's decision to essentially suspend his presidential campaign and focus instead on safeguarding his congressional seat will confuse and disappoint many of his supporters, while delighting establishment media debunkers.
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:59.883]  But the truth of how far we have progressed and the reality of the battles that lie ahead show that the campaign has made a shrewd decision.
[00:30:00.404 --> 00:30:08.268]  After months of media censorship, smear attacks, and dirty tricks, and no doubt election fraud I would add, Ron Paul was essentially left with four choices.
[00:30:09.908 --> 00:30:17.632]  One, drop out of the Republican race altogether and allow the establishment to claim a hollow victory while disappointing his legions of supporters.
[00:30:17.912 --> 00:30:18.913]  This was never going to happen.
[00:30:19.429 --> 00:30:25.670]  Drop out, now this is two, drop out of the Republican race and run as a third-party candidate up against Hillary and McCain.
[00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:32.912]  Paul would have a 20-30 percent chance of success but would have immediately endangered his congressional seat.
[00:30:34.872 --> 00:30:42.314]  Seek to, this is number three, seek to capitalize on a broker convention should the Republicans' conservative base move against the left-leaning McCain.
[00:30:42.954 --> 00:30:48.535]  This was always a remote option because to have any chances of success Paul would have to have had
[00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:53.739]  to have been trailing McCain by just a few percentage points in primary results, which is not the case.
[00:30:54.499 --> 00:30:56.220]  This is number four in what he decided to do.
[00:30:56.901 --> 00:31:10.288]  Stay in the presidential race in the hope that a scandal would cripple McCain and leave Paul going head-to-head with Huckabee, but essentially shift all campaigning efforts to focus on his congressional seat, which is now under great threat.
[00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:11.569]  And that's what he did.
[00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:13.130]  And something may still happen.
[00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:14.831]  But looking at these four options,
[00:31:16.033 --> 00:31:19.135]  I have to tell you, it is the safest direction and he is gone.
[00:31:21.497 --> 00:31:27.381]  A rearguard action in Texas, where the party machinery and the media are going after him big time, and I live here and they are.
[00:31:27.881 --> 00:31:28.382]  Let me tell you.
[00:31:30.023 --> 00:31:43.592]  While continuing to make sure that real issues of anti-war, pro, you know, the majority of the troops, he got more campaign contributions from the troops than, and from veterans than all the Republican candidates combined.
[00:31:46.581 --> 00:31:47.361]  This is amazing!
[00:31:49.183 --> 00:31:58.028]  So he needs to stay in there, and he is staying in there, to continue educating and to continue making sure that constitutional ideals are injected.
[00:32:00.229 --> 00:32:08.374]  But if he did a third party, he would have a slight chance, some chance, to stay in it presidentially, but he would probably lose his congressional seat.
[00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:10.356]  Now I ask you, what should Ron Paul do?
[00:32:11.416 --> 00:32:13.938]  Paul rightfully picked the fourth option and is going
[00:32:14.679 --> 00:32:23.548]  And in doing so has adopted a rear-guard stance to safeguard the influence he has already accrued as a result of appearing in the debates on the campaign trail.
[00:32:23.948 --> 00:32:33.258]  Should he retain his seat, Paul will return to Congress with the backing of a gigantic grassroots following, the likes of which has not been enjoyed by any other politician in recent times.
[00:32:33.798 --> 00:32:38.563]  The congressman summed it up in a passage of his press release last night.
[00:32:39.187 --> 00:32:40.388]  I also have another priority.
[00:32:40.508 --> 00:32:43.150]  I have constituents in my home district that I must serve.
[00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:45.152]  I cannot and will not let them down.
[00:32:45.432 --> 00:32:47.494]  And I have another battle I must face here as well.
[00:32:48.295 --> 00:32:55.921]  If I were to lose the primary for my congressional seat, all our opponents would react with glee and pretend it was a rejection of our ideas.
[00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:58.043]  I cannot and will not let that happen.
[00:33:00.037 --> 00:33:02.218]  And the article continues on from there.
[00:33:02.278 --> 00:33:03.239]  Let me just read the rest of it.
[00:33:03.559 --> 00:33:15.426]  Paul's Texas District 14 congressional seat is being challenged by pro-war neocon Chris Peden, who deceived the congressman by going back on his word that he would not run against Paul during the presidential race.
[00:33:15.987 --> 00:33:22.272]  The Paul campaign have evaluated the circumstances and the consequences of losing the congressional seat, and have responded accordingly.
[00:33:22.772 --> 00:33:35.221]  In shifting the focus of his campaign, Paul will still be able to use the millions raised in his name to hold his district, and he will still appear in national debates to educate people about the real power structure that seeks to control and dominate us.
[00:33:35.621 --> 00:33:38.904]  Undoubtedly, a certain portion of Ron Paul supporters will feel disappointed.
[00:33:39.264 --> 00:33:46.608]  And let down by the fact that the congressman is all but suspending his presidential campaign and most of these individuals will be new to politics.
[00:33:47.129 --> 00:33:52.292]  They need to understand that we cannot and will not win the game with the first roll of the dice.
[00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:56.154]  America was not gutted overnight and it will not be restored overnight.
[00:33:57.219 --> 00:33:57.840]  Absolutely.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.661]  People are talking about the Federal Reserve being private.
[00:33:59.681 --> 00:34:01.302]  They're talking about world government.
[00:34:01.322 --> 00:34:03.143]  They're talking about NAFTA superhighways.
[00:34:03.503 --> 00:34:05.284]  They're talking about the inflation tax.
[00:34:05.565 --> 00:34:12.389]  They're talking about how both parties are pro-war, despite the fact that 75 to 80 percent of the public, depending on the poll, are against the war.
[00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:14.110]  He has done a great job.
[00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.151]  You have done a great job.
[00:34:15.391 --> 00:34:16.932]  But you asked him to get in the arena.
[00:34:17.212 --> 00:34:18.173]  You asked him to fight.
[00:34:18.991 --> 00:34:23.495]  Okay, against incredible odds, and you can't be sore losers in the end.
[00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:29.760]  We have made great strides, instead of just letting the two parties stage-manage a dog and pony show.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.743]  Also, we've proven election fraud, and he said it was definitely there in Louisiana.
[00:34:34.284 --> 00:34:38.347]  They cheated him in Nevada, saying he only got fourth place when he really got second place.
[00:34:38.707 --> 00:34:39.568]  That's now been admitted.
[00:34:39.928 --> 00:34:40.949]  People have now learned.
[00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:47.755]  People always email me and call me and write me and say, why are you saying there's election fraud coast to coast, but we should still vote?
[00:34:48.846 --> 00:34:55.552]  Because by having poll watchers, by voting, by being involved in the political process, we educate people that there is fraud.
[00:34:56.973 --> 00:34:59.715]  You see, we have to be in the arena, even if it's a stacked deck.
[00:34:59.995 --> 00:35:01.176]  We can't just give up.
[00:35:02.197 --> 00:35:07.521]  People are going to prison for election fraud in Ohio from the presidential election, as we said they would.
[00:35:08.102 --> 00:35:11.945]  People are in deep trouble in New Hampshire for what went on there.
[00:35:12.426 --> 00:35:16.668]  The population is being educated right now about what's going on.
[00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:20.369]  If we don't fight back, and if we don't stay in the fight, that doesn't happen.
[00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:25.852]  The Ron Paul Revolution was the first major salvo in a battle for our freedom that will never end.
[00:35:26.232 --> 00:35:30.774]  What we are fighting is a war of ideas, an information war, and a game of brinksmanship.
[00:35:31.094 --> 00:35:40.278]  The fact that Ron Paul's message resonated and woke up millions of people is a victory in itself and provides us with a niche with which to focus and continue our efforts.
[00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:53.995]  The focus now shifts to the Congressional race, and if we can help Ron Paul retain his seat, then the power of our message will be amplified in Congress, especially even when Hillary Clinton is anointed in the White House and continues the same policies we saw under Bush.
[00:35:54.555 --> 00:36:01.899]  It is essential and shrewd to maintain a positive attitude and consider how far along the path we have traveled in the pursuit of restoring liberty.
[00:36:02.219 --> 00:36:08.722]  A powerful message has been broadcast to those who would attempt to enslave us, that we are here, and that we will be
[00:36:09.648 --> 00:36:13.449]  There will be a reaction, and our numbers and influence will only continue to grow.
[00:36:13.769 --> 00:36:15.770]  Presidential race or no presidential race.
[00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.851]  As we have said all along, this is not about a political campaign.
[00:36:21.271 --> 00:36:25.172]  This is about 2008, and this is not even about Ron Paul.
[00:36:25.632 --> 00:36:26.832]  This is about an idea.
[00:36:27.192 --> 00:36:33.514]  An idea that surpasses the transitory nature of a presidential election, and one which can
[00:36:34.298 --> 00:36:37.521]  Not, and will not be stopped, no matter what the circumstances.
[00:36:38.061 --> 00:36:40.643]  As Ron Paul says himself, the revolution is permanent.
[00:36:40.863 --> 00:36:43.025]  It will not end at the Republican Convention.
[00:36:43.045 --> 00:36:43.946]  It will not end in November.
[00:36:44.166 --> 00:36:47.389]  It will not end until we have won the great battle on which we have embarked.
[00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:49.630]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:51.892]  I'll go directly to the loaded phone line.
[00:36:51.972 --> 00:36:52.473]  Stay with me.
[00:36:52.793 --> 00:36:54.835]  Hi neighbor.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.621]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:09.162]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[00:37:09.762 --> 00:37:14.444]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[00:37:15.085 --> 00:37:17.066]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[00:37:17.606 --> 00:37:23.188]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:27.570]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[00:37:28.513 --> 00:37:32.255]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[00:37:32.755 --> 00:37:37.897]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[00:37:38.577 --> 00:37:46.821]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[00:37:47.301 --> 00:37:48.422]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:37:48.442 --> 00:37:48.602]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:38:00.669 --> 00:38:05.616]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:38:05.936 --> 00:38:07.818]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:11.063]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:38:11.243 --> 00:38:14.387]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:38:14.687 --> 00:38:16.530]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:20.494]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:38:20.794 --> 00:38:23.457]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[00:38:24.078 --> 00:38:28.342]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:38:28.562 --> 00:38:32.867]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:38:33.267 --> 00:38:37.592]  The Bible says, Would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[00:38:37.912 --> 00:38:39.934]  These materials document the global leaders,
[00:38:40.094 --> 00:38:44.255]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[00:38:44.315 --> 00:38:44.855]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[00:39:10.876 --> 00:39:15.319]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:17.781]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[00:39:18.121 --> 00:39:19.202]  They keep you down.
[00:39:19.362 --> 00:39:20.263]  They keep you blue.
[00:39:20.563 --> 00:39:23.465]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[00:39:25.486 --> 00:39:27.588]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[00:39:27.948 --> 00:39:33.312]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:39.762]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[00:39:39.802 --> 00:39:43.443]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:39:44.644 --> 00:39:49.526]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[00:39:49.586 --> 00:39:53.508]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:39:54.088 --> 00:39:56.229]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:58.490]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.221]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:40:03.561 --> 00:40:04.841]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:40:05.121 --> 00:40:07.102]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:40:07.262 --> 00:40:09.003]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:40:09.163 --> 00:40:10.403]  The late, great USA.
[00:40:10.643 --> 00:40:12.063]  America, freedom to fascism.

[00:41:10.037 --> 00:41:16.662]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:41:16.822 --> 00:41:18.543]  I interviewed Willie Nelson on Monday.
[00:41:18.563 --> 00:41:21.165]  I'll tell you about that and play some excerpts.
[00:41:21.905 --> 00:41:23.587]  I haven't done that yet since I had him on.
[00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:29.492]  Coming up in the second hour, dealing with 9-11 truth.
[00:41:29.612 --> 00:41:31.552]  Well, he thinks it's an inside job.
[00:41:32.153 --> 00:41:33.253]  Tell you who else thinks so.
[00:41:33.273 --> 00:41:38.735]  But right now, let's go to your calls at 877-590-5525.
[00:41:39.115 --> 00:41:45.457]  Let's go ahead and talk to Neil in New York.
[00:41:45.497 --> 00:41:46.157]  You're on the air.
[00:41:46.197 --> 00:41:46.798]  Thanks for holding.
[00:41:46.818 --> 00:41:47.198]  Go ahead.
[00:41:47.218 --> 00:41:48.978]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:41:49.038 --> 00:41:51.459]  My name's Neil, not Neil, but I got that mixed up.
[00:41:51.479 --> 00:41:52.840]  How you doing today?
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:53.380]  I'm all right.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:53.620]  Go ahead.
[00:41:56.461 --> 00:41:57.941]  I want to show one of your films.
[00:41:58.441 --> 00:42:03.864]  It's Endgame and My School at Hudson County Community College and I'd just like to have your endorsement and your consent.
[00:42:04.704 --> 00:42:06.405]  Yeah, it's for free on Google Video.
[00:42:06.465 --> 00:42:08.506]  I give the consent to everybody to show it to whoever they want.
[00:42:09.246 --> 00:42:10.427]  No, I don't want to buy the hard copy.
[00:42:10.467 --> 00:42:12.268]  I went to Barnes & Noble today and I couldn't find it.
[00:42:12.288 --> 00:42:14.028]  So I thought I'd have to order online.
[00:42:14.048 --> 00:42:22.712]  Yeah, it's been in Barnes & Nobles and all those places, but it's been in Best Buy, but I think most stores order like five, six copies and then they sell out.
[00:42:24.986 --> 00:42:26.207]  Yeah, it's sad.
[00:42:26.227 --> 00:42:29.491]  You know, you see all these movies about diehard and this and that.
[00:42:29.511 --> 00:42:34.616]  And then your movie, Endgame, where he finds his copy selling in stock.
[00:42:35.036 --> 00:42:36.357]  It's really sad about this.
[00:42:36.858 --> 00:42:46.668]  About this government and people who I try to tell and wake them up and tell them about what President Bush does when he's out in Bolton and Grove.
[00:42:47.068 --> 00:42:48.890]  But they literally make him crazy.
[00:42:49.457 --> 00:42:50.397]  Well, so what?
[00:42:50.477 --> 00:42:51.538]  You know, let them be slaves.
[00:42:51.578 --> 00:42:53.158]  They like having their dollar devalued.
[00:42:53.358 --> 00:42:55.299]  They like being shot up with mercury vaccines.
[00:42:55.519 --> 00:42:56.980]  They like drinking sodium fluoride.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.460]  They like it.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:58.941]  So just let them like it.
[00:43:00.281 --> 00:43:01.642]  Feel free to show it at your school, sir.
[00:43:02.102 --> 00:43:04.943]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to Clint.
[00:43:05.563 --> 00:43:07.304]  And, Clint, where are you calling us from today?
[00:43:08.164 --> 00:43:09.445]  I'm calling from Missouri, Alex.
[00:43:09.545 --> 00:43:09.765]  Welcome.
[00:43:09.785 --> 00:43:12.826]  It's been a while since I talked to you, but I listen often.
[00:43:12.886 --> 00:43:14.426]  I used to have a lot more time to call you.
[00:43:16.457 --> 00:43:40.032]  I gotta tell you, this whole thing has left a bad taste in my mouth because I just feel like Paul has abandoned us and has retreated to Texas to save Texas and I don't agree with the idea that millions of hard-working Americans have donated their money for him to run for president and then turn around and use it in a congressional race.
[00:43:42.594 --> 00:43:43.434]  I voted for him.
[00:43:43.855 --> 00:43:44.215]  I did.
[00:43:44.235 --> 00:43:45.656]  But I don't agree with that.
[00:43:47.065 --> 00:43:48.686]  Well, we're not even sure that's what's happening.
[00:43:48.706 --> 00:43:51.569]  He says he's going to keep spending it in the presidential race.
[00:43:51.609 --> 00:43:53.050]  He's staying in the presidential race.
[00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.993]  It's just he doesn't have much of a prayer of winning it now, sir.
[00:43:57.473 --> 00:44:04.199]  Well, I know he doesn't, but I also felt like his campaign kind of botched it.
[00:44:04.839 --> 00:44:14.667]  Even though it's not right that it works this way, I don't know why they just didn't use a very large portion of that money in either New Hampshire or South Carolina
[00:44:15.256 --> 00:44:19.777]  To try and get an early win so the public might possibly back him more.
[00:44:19.937 --> 00:44:23.919]  Well, they did try and it was clearly fraud in New Hampshire, but I understand your concerns.
[00:44:24.319 --> 00:44:28.440]  Listen, it's not fun to lose, but we won in the war of ideas.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.380]  We could have just laid there.
[00:44:30.241 --> 00:44:31.681]  And look at what the grassroots did.
[00:44:31.721 --> 00:44:36.122]  Just an example of what the grassroots can do and that the American people don't want this tyranny.
[00:44:36.463 --> 00:44:38.483]  Breaking all those fundraising records.
[00:44:38.503 --> 00:44:40.624]  6.4 million in one day.
[00:44:41.984 --> 00:44:42.865]  That broke all records.
[00:44:42.905 --> 00:44:44.245]  That was small donations.
[00:44:45.347 --> 00:44:45.708]  Okay.
[00:44:46.369 --> 00:44:50.014]  I mean, let's let this flesh out a little bit before we get mad.
[00:44:52.097 --> 00:44:55.462]  Alrighty, let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Los Angeles.
[00:44:55.802 --> 00:44:56.643]  You're on the air, Steve.
[00:44:56.663 --> 00:44:57.024]  Go ahead.
[00:44:57.524 --> 00:44:58.085]  Hello, Alex.
[00:44:58.225 --> 00:44:58.386]  Hi.
[00:44:59.437 --> 00:45:05.160]  Hey, first of all, I heard at the front of your show you were a little discouraged, and I just wanted to tell you there is hope.
[00:45:06.641 --> 00:45:21.590]  I've been laughed at by my wife for a couple of years now since I've been listening to you, and I gave her a copy of Creature from Jekyll Island, and it has totally changed her way of thinking, and she's now out telling everybody she knows about the Federal Reserve, so there is hope.
[00:45:22.351 --> 00:45:22.791]  That's right.
[00:45:22.831 --> 00:45:27.133]  A great book by G. Edward Griffin about the private nature and how the Federal Reserve took over.
[00:45:27.534 --> 00:45:27.714]  Right.
[00:45:28.762 --> 00:45:29.263]  Excellent book.
[00:45:29.743 --> 00:45:31.464]  Anyway, about Ron Paul.
[00:45:31.644 --> 00:45:33.245]  I'm a supporter out here in California.
[00:45:33.265 --> 00:45:34.686]  I'm driving around with a bumper sticker.
[00:45:35.327 --> 00:45:36.988]  I'm talking to as many people as I can.
[00:45:37.008 --> 00:45:48.976]  I've got to tell you, I feel just like the last caller that Ron Paul is taking the donations and kind of retreating back to his congressional seat to save it.
[00:45:49.776 --> 00:45:55.580]  I understand the logic and I understand where you're coming from with that, but I just wanted to throw out a couple of ideas here.
[00:45:57.944 --> 00:46:04.207]  The first is, Ron Paul is not the brand name of this revolution.
[00:46:04.487 --> 00:46:09.609]  It belongs to all of us as the people, as American citizens.
[00:46:09.629 --> 00:46:12.791]  Ron Paul is not the only one who can stand up for us.
[00:46:13.691 --> 00:46:16.192]  We can throw our support behind other candidates.
[00:46:16.493 --> 00:46:20.954]  If Ron Paul isn't willing to do a third-party run, we still need to have a horse in the race.
[00:46:21.375 --> 00:46:26.417]  Now let me just point your attention to somebody who you know, who's been on your show, Cynthia McKinney.
[00:46:26.777 --> 00:46:35.481]  She's never backed away from 9-11 Truths, she's never backed away from DynCorp, and I've seen her stand up in Congress and confront Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:46:35.821 --> 00:46:37.402]  She has got more courage than
[00:46:38.361 --> 00:46:42.335]  Anybody who's ever held, as far as I'm concerned, that holds a seat in Congress.
[00:46:42.697 --> 00:46:44.463]  And she has given up her local seat.
[00:46:45.606 --> 00:46:47.968]  You know, she sacrificed her local seat for her beliefs.
[00:46:48.528 --> 00:46:52.390]  She didn't back down and say, hey look, I'm going to preserve my seat here in Georgia.
[00:46:52.731 --> 00:46:53.431]  She lost it.
[00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:55.572]  And then she came back and fought and won it again.
[00:46:56.113 --> 00:46:58.594]  And then she was beat again by the election fraud.
[00:46:59.075 --> 00:47:04.638]  So let's think about throwing some of our support behind Cynthia McKinney just to keep our voice out there.
[00:47:04.818 --> 00:47:06.739]  No, I hear you and I'm looking at that.
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.080]  I like Cynthia.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:12.183]  She exposed the dying court child kidnapping rings, the trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[00:47:12.574 --> 00:47:14.695]  Just incredible information, and I know her.
[00:47:14.715 --> 00:47:15.255]  I've interviewed her.
[00:47:15.275 --> 00:47:16.575]  She's in with Ron Paul.
[00:47:16.595 --> 00:47:17.795]  He's in my film, Matrix of Evil.
[00:47:17.836 --> 00:47:18.836]  Ron Paul and her are both in there.
[00:47:19.816 --> 00:47:25.878]  But, you know, the gun control and a few other stances she's in make it really hard for me to support her.
[00:47:25.898 --> 00:47:28.118]  I like a lot of Dennis Kucinich's ideas.
[00:47:28.158 --> 00:47:30.459]  He's now dropped out, but I don't like some of his ideas.
[00:47:30.819 --> 00:47:34.960]  Ron Paul and I were, you know, right together as constitutionalists.
[00:47:36.181 --> 00:47:39.062]  I know people are mad about Ron Paul and what's happened here.
[00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:42.833]  I don't know how to explain it.
[00:47:44.014 --> 00:47:44.835]  He will lose.
[00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:47.758]  If he goes third party, he will lose that congressional seat.
[00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:50.460]  Now, I would probably be reckless.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.883]  I would probably go with the third party and I think he's got a shot.
[00:47:53.483 --> 00:47:59.409]  And frankly, I've been pulling for a third party and not this broker convention business.
[00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:01.831]  It's only good in close races.
[00:48:05.379 --> 00:48:07.040]  But I understand why.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.721]  Look, he's staying in the presidential race.
[00:48:09.061 --> 00:48:10.482]  Something could happen with McCain.
[00:48:10.943 --> 00:48:11.963]  Scandals could come out.
[00:48:11.983 --> 00:48:12.744]  They already are.
[00:48:14.145 --> 00:48:16.546]  And then it could just be Ron Paul and Huckabee.
[00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:18.627]  Or Huckabee could drop out.
[00:48:18.707 --> 00:48:19.848]  Who knows what's going to happen?
[00:48:20.248 --> 00:48:23.591]  He had some good showings in quite a few states last night.
[00:48:23.631 --> 00:48:24.271]  Ron Paul did.
[00:48:25.772 --> 00:48:29.334]  It's just things don't look very good on the presidential run within the party.
[00:48:29.975 --> 00:48:30.335]  And so
[00:48:31.634 --> 00:48:34.535]  I've tried to break that down as best I can, but we're taking your calls.
[00:48:34.555 --> 00:48:35.695]  We're taking your views on this.
[00:48:35.775 --> 00:48:37.975]  We want to hear what you have to say.
[00:48:38.075 --> 00:48:39.735]  Mark in Boise, Idaho.
[00:48:39.755 --> 00:48:40.336]  You're on the air.
[00:48:40.356 --> 00:48:40.676]  Welcome.
[00:48:41.976 --> 00:48:42.556]  Hi, Alex.
[00:48:42.596 --> 00:48:44.356]  This is my first time caller.
[00:48:44.556 --> 00:48:44.876]  Welcome.
[00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:46.777]  Hi.
[00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:53.818]  I want to say that Ron Paul had an excellent idea for civil liberties when it came to law enforcement.
[00:48:54.698 --> 00:49:00.599]  Personal experience with a civil liberties violation, both difficulties on both sides, which is why I came up.
[00:49:01.385 --> 00:49:04.667]  with an idea of how to create video evidence.
[00:49:04.767 --> 00:49:11.651]  I wanted to share briefly with your listeners on how to use VHS tapes instead of computerized video software.
[00:49:11.671 --> 00:49:12.652]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:49:14.393 --> 00:49:24.399]  Well, what you do is you take one of the digital video cameras and you have a VCR connected to your TV making sure everything works.
[00:49:25.019 --> 00:49:27.801]  You put in a VHS tape about two hours worth
[00:49:28.792 --> 00:49:32.595]  You pop in the AV cable to connect... Okay, I understand all that.
[00:49:32.635 --> 00:49:33.116]  Get to it.
[00:49:33.216 --> 00:49:33.516]  Please.
[00:49:34.477 --> 00:49:34.757]  Yes.
[00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:40.802]  Um... I... Sorry.
[00:49:42.404 --> 00:49:43.565]  Look, I'm not in a good mood today.
[00:49:43.605 --> 00:49:44.806]  I'm just going to tell you right now, sir.
[00:49:45.286 --> 00:49:47.889]  If you want to, uh... They're laughing.
[00:49:48.849 --> 00:49:50.451]  I probably shouldn't do shows when I'm in a bad mood.
[00:49:50.491 --> 00:49:52.372]  I'm mad about the Ron Paul stuff, too, okay?
[00:49:52.412 --> 00:49:56.456]  I'm so mad that I probably shouldn't even be on the air right now, but I'm trying to be calm.
[00:49:57.301 --> 00:49:58.061]  Trying to be nice.
[00:49:58.502 --> 00:49:59.482]  Trying to be positive.
[00:50:01.583 --> 00:50:04.064]  If you want to put it together in an email, sir, send it to me.
[00:50:04.645 --> 00:50:07.346]  Put it on the message board on InfoWars.com or something like that.
[00:50:07.386 --> 00:50:07.906]  That'll be great.
[00:50:07.966 --> 00:50:08.186]  Okay?
[00:50:08.766 --> 00:50:09.167]  Thank you.
[00:50:10.207 --> 00:50:12.808]  Let's go ahead and jam in some more calls here.
[00:50:13.409 --> 00:50:15.850]  Let's talk to Carl in Montreal, Canada.
[00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:17.010]  You're on the air, Carl.
[00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.431]  Go ahead.
[00:50:19.492 --> 00:50:19.912]  Is this me?
[00:50:20.032 --> 00:50:20.512]  Yes, it is.
[00:50:20.692 --> 00:50:21.092]  Oh, hey.
[00:50:21.272 --> 00:50:22.353]  It's Mitchell in Texas.
[00:50:22.493 --> 00:50:26.275]  I was just going to ask you about what's going on about the
[00:50:27.302 --> 00:50:34.307]  John McCain not having been born in the United States and maybe not meeting... Yeah, but that doesn't count if you're on a naval ship.
[00:50:34.347 --> 00:50:39.971]  His dad was a Navy Admiral and just because he was born in Panama doesn't mean that he is not a U.S.
[00:50:39.991 --> 00:50:44.114]  citizen because the State Department deals with those documents and it makes you a joint citizen.
[00:50:44.835 --> 00:50:51.179]  I've been getting, and you know, I don't know the accuracy of what I'm getting, but I've been getting, let's see, from the U.S.
[00:50:51.199 --> 00:50:52.240]  Department website.
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.142]  It says, despite widespread popular belief, U.S.
[00:50:55.182 --> 00:50:56.663]  military installations abroad.
[00:50:57.079 --> 00:51:01.683]  Well, I know that may be the case now because they encourage diplomatic corps and others to have their children back in country.
[00:51:24.466 --> 00:51:29.770]  I know there are a lot of people who were born in the military outside the country who are instantly U.S.
[00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:31.791]  citizens because their parents are U.S.
[00:51:31.831 --> 00:51:32.212]  citizens.
[00:51:32.232 --> 00:51:35.654]  But if they choose, they can then have dual citizenship with that nation.
[00:51:35.674 --> 00:51:42.199]  Okay, we'll come back and take more of the fun calls at 877-590-5525 after the news.
[00:51:42.499 --> 00:51:45.421]  Then all this great Willie Nelson news and a bunch of horrible police state news.
[00:51:45.741 --> 00:51:46.542]  I've got to cover as well.
[00:51:46.562 --> 00:51:46.942]  Stay with us.
[00:51:50.777 --> 00:51:51.778]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:51.818 --> 00:51:55.000]  As you know, GCN is a huge supporter of Ron Paul and all he stands for.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:52:03.405]  That's why, for a limited time, I have personally set aside commercial inventory allowing advertisers the chance to show their personal support for Ron Paul while promoting their products.
[00:52:03.566 --> 00:52:09.910]  If you would like to voice your support for Ron Paul's march to the White House and have thought about advertising on GCN, give us a call at 877-996-4327.
[00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:12.792]  That's 877-996-4327 or go to GCNlive.com today and click on the Support Ron Paul link on our homepage.
[00:52:22.218 --> 00:52:23.218]  Looking for profit?
[00:52:23.298 --> 00:52:24.679]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:52:24.939 --> 00:52:28.240]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:35.843]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:52:35.903 --> 00:52:39.624]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:52:39.644 --> 00:52:41.165]  Secure your position today.
[00:52:41.485 --> 00:52:42.725]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:42.745 --> 00:52:42.985]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.580]  I'm listening.
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:59.382]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio that will give you a snooze like no other.
[00:52:59.522 --> 00:53:00.862]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:53:00.922 --> 00:53:01.523]  Hold on.
[00:53:02.483 --> 00:53:03.843]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:05.264 --> 00:53:07.104]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:08.464 --> 00:53:10.045]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:10.485 --> 00:53:13.205]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:14.226 --> 00:53:17.026]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590
[00:53:20.117 --> 00:53:22.839]  Today's The Patriots is next.
[00:53:22.899 --> 00:53:26.881]  Tonight starring Willie Nelson and me!
[00:53:27.041 --> 00:53:27.282]  Uh-oh!
[00:53:27.302 --> 00:53:29.783]  Right back.
[00:53:43.442 --> 00:53:44.722]  Time now for Pennant and Patriots.
[00:53:44.983 --> 00:53:47.443]  I, your humble correspondent, am the Patriot tonight.
[00:53:47.683 --> 00:53:49.964]  I know that doesn't sound humble, but hear me out.
[00:53:50.444 --> 00:53:55.446]  For the past few years, the Scripps Howard News Agency has run an article where famous people picked the Super Bowl winner.
[00:53:55.506 --> 00:53:58.947]  Right now, I have the longest running streak in the country.
[00:53:59.547 --> 00:54:01.468]  Five straight picked correctly.
[00:54:01.548 --> 00:54:05.289]  So, in the Super Bowl predicting category, I'm a Patriot.
[00:54:05.669 --> 00:54:07.810]  I just wish I could pick political races as well.
[00:54:08.755 --> 00:54:11.999]  On the pinhead front, we are on the road again with Willie Nelson.
[00:54:12.159 --> 00:54:16.445]  The 74 year old singer counts himself among the 9-11 conspiracy nuts.
[00:54:18.207 --> 00:54:19.409]  What's your take on 9-11?
[00:54:20.029 --> 00:54:21.231]  Do you question the official story?
[00:54:21.983 --> 00:54:27.968]  I certainly do, and I saw those towers fall, and I've seen an implosion in Las Vegas.
[00:54:28.709 --> 00:54:30.851]  There was too much similarities between the two.
[00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:34.354]  And I saw the building fall, it didn't get hit by nothing.
[00:54:34.434 --> 00:54:38.137]  So, you know, how naive are we?
[00:54:38.437 --> 00:54:39.839]  What do they think we'll go for?
[00:54:39.859 --> 00:54:42.561]  Good grief.
[00:54:43.081 --> 00:54:43.482]  Pinhead.
[00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:55.760]  No, you're a pinhead posing as a conservative while the neocons sell this country out, butcher our borders, go after our guns, and have a five plus year fraudulent war based on lies.
[00:54:56.481 --> 00:54:58.623]  You are a pinhead and that is coming up later.
[00:54:58.883 --> 00:55:00.625]  Look on the Ron Paul issue.
[00:55:01.792 --> 00:55:03.434]  He hasn't done well in the primaries.
[00:55:03.474 --> 00:55:04.796]  You tried as hard as you could.
[00:55:05.056 --> 00:55:09.842]  He's going to stay in to see what happens in case McCain with a scandal drops out or something.
[00:55:10.202 --> 00:55:15.528]  They're coming after him, the Republican machinery and Democrats are coming after him in Texas for what he dared do.
[00:55:15.769 --> 00:55:17.711]  He's fighting for his political life.
[00:55:18.332 --> 00:55:19.613]  He's done a great job.
[00:55:19.814 --> 00:55:20.915]  Nobody is perfect.
[00:55:21.434 --> 00:55:25.395]  But we have to understand this movement is a lot bigger than Ron Paul as he has always said.
[00:55:25.935 --> 00:55:29.216]  And it doesn't die because he doesn't win.
[00:55:29.236 --> 00:55:30.296]  It continues.
[00:55:30.516 --> 00:55:32.776]  The people are waking up to the New World Order.
[00:55:32.976 --> 00:55:34.217]  And we're never going to stop.
[00:55:34.837 --> 00:55:37.737]  We're never going to stop reaching out and waking people up.
[00:55:37.977 --> 00:55:39.238]  We're having a big effect.
[00:55:39.298 --> 00:55:43.078]  A lot of people in society are now getting their wake-up call.
[00:55:43.318 --> 00:55:44.659]  They're smelling the coffee.
[00:55:44.679 --> 00:55:51.020]  So what we need to do now at all these meet-up groups and all these other organizations is continue to support Ron Paul.
[00:55:51.698 --> 00:56:01.542]  But also make it about picking issues, confronting corrupt politicians, exposing McCain, exposing Hillary, exposing Barack Obama, all is established with shills!
[00:56:01.883 --> 00:56:03.984]  Our fight is with them, not with Ron Paul!
[00:56:05.564 --> 00:56:10.807]  I've given money, I've given time, I've given energy, but we knew it was a shot in the dark.
[00:56:10.847 --> 00:56:12.067]  We knew it was a long shot.
[00:56:13.288 --> 00:56:13.608]  Okay?
[00:56:14.235 --> 00:56:17.998]  Now I know I got loaded phone lines and I want to take all your calls and I don't want to sound rude today.
[00:56:18.298 --> 00:56:19.359]  I've had a bad attitude.
[00:56:19.439 --> 00:56:20.600]  I've been mad about this too.
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:22.842]  I've been mad since I learned about it Saturday morning.
[00:56:24.062 --> 00:56:25.243]  But I'm mad at the system.
[00:56:25.323 --> 00:56:27.605]  I'm mad at them cheating him in New Hampshire and other states.
[00:56:27.845 --> 00:56:29.266]  We know there was election fraud.
[00:56:31.368 --> 00:56:33.470]  We know they're cheating Barack Obama as well.
[00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:34.410]  I don't even like him.
[00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:35.271]  That's just the facts.
[00:56:36.092 --> 00:56:37.152]  I just report the facts.
[00:56:37.192 --> 00:56:43.017]  But the bigger news here is the Republican Party's gotten behind John McCain saying he's good.
[00:56:43.692 --> 00:56:46.013]  This guy is almost worse than Hillary Clinton!
[00:56:48.413 --> 00:56:51.134]  But she is the worst at the end of the day because McCain's gonna fail.
[00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:52.234]  He's meant to fail against her.
[00:56:52.454 --> 00:56:53.554]  He's got a glass jaw.
[00:56:53.974 --> 00:56:54.635]  He will fall down.
[00:56:54.655 --> 00:56:56.895]  He's got so many skeletons in his closet.
[00:56:57.255 --> 00:56:59.716]  He's got so many serious issues that you watch.
[00:57:03.177 --> 00:57:05.057]  They're positioning Hillary Clinton right now.
[00:57:05.717 --> 00:57:06.897]  I've been telling you that for years.
[00:57:08.518 --> 00:57:13.179]  And there's no accident that all these big neocon talk show hosts and pundits are now supporting her.
[00:57:14.269 --> 00:57:17.512]  Alright, look, I'm going to take a bunch of your calls here, because I want to get you on air, but it's a catch-22.
[00:57:17.792 --> 00:57:19.494]  Either I go to you quick, or I don't get to any of you.
[00:57:20.514 --> 00:57:20.875]  Alright?
[00:57:21.155 --> 00:57:22.636]  Let's go to Andrew in Wisconsin.
[00:57:22.656 --> 00:57:23.497]  Thanks for holding, Andrew.
[00:57:23.517 --> 00:57:24.037]  You're on the air.
[00:57:24.958 --> 00:57:25.879]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:57:26.159 --> 00:57:29.982]  Talked before, but I just wanted to say it's a happy birthday.
[00:57:30.002 --> 00:57:30.723]  I know it's tomorrow.
[00:57:31.424 --> 00:57:31.784]  Thank you.
[00:57:32.104 --> 00:57:33.185]  What are you, 34?
[00:57:33.305 --> 00:57:33.525]  Yeah.
[00:57:34.166 --> 00:57:36.128]  Okay, well that's pretty young, you know what I'm saying?
[00:57:36.228 --> 00:57:37.689]  Getting old here, yeah.
[00:57:37.709 --> 00:57:38.390]  Yeah, you're a young guy.
[00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:40.271]  You've got a long way to go, you know what I'm saying?
[00:57:41.798 --> 00:57:43.299]  It's a scary outlook.
[00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:45.260]  I don't know what it's going to be, right?
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.381]  Have you seen all the Marshall Law stuff I saw today?
[00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:49.061]  You'd be upset.
[00:57:49.982 --> 00:57:53.223]  That on top of this campaign, the rest of it just totally freaking me out.
[00:57:53.503 --> 00:57:55.164]  Republicans supporting John McCain.
[00:57:55.204 --> 00:57:56.144]  I mean, I'm freaked out.
[00:57:56.984 --> 00:57:57.705]  It is.
[00:57:57.725 --> 00:57:58.325]  Well, you know what?
[00:57:58.365 --> 00:58:02.527]  We're seeing an awakening with the Ron Paul signs on highways, on driving.
[00:58:03.642 --> 00:58:06.064]  Uh, I see people... Look, I've been all over the country.
[00:58:06.125 --> 00:58:08.267]  Ron Paul got a lot more votes than we were told.
[00:58:08.427 --> 00:58:09.187]  He was cheated!
[00:58:09.408 --> 00:58:10.309]  It's not his fault!
[00:58:10.669 --> 00:58:12.491]  No, I'm saying... What I'm saying is... I agree with you!
[00:58:12.671 --> 00:58:15.013]  He's a good old guy, and people need to back that.
[00:58:15.073 --> 00:58:19.437]  And they seem to just overnight go, we didn't get an answer result, I'm done with it.
[00:58:19.477 --> 00:58:20.818]  That's not the way it's gotta be.
[00:58:20.879 --> 00:58:25.503]  It's gotta be... Every person has to start looking at themselves and stop going...
[00:58:26.318 --> 00:58:30.841]  Alex Jones has to do this, and you do it, as an individual, as a person, you know what I'm saying?
[00:58:30.901 --> 00:58:31.421]  Absolutely.
[00:58:31.461 --> 00:58:32.161]  Beautiful call.
[00:58:32.241 --> 00:58:36.684]  And all the tens of millions of people that have formed... I mean, Ron Paul just spoke two nights ago.
[00:58:36.704 --> 00:58:40.406]  8,500 people at a venue Hillary had been at with 1,000.
[00:58:40.786 --> 00:58:43.407]  In Minnesota, he got 5,000, where she got 3,000.
[00:58:43.507 --> 00:58:47.970]  I mean, he's getting crowds of 5,000 and 8,000 everywhere he goes.
[00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:50.051]  It's building exponentially.
[00:58:50.271 --> 00:58:51.632]  He's staying in the campaign.
[00:58:54.286 --> 00:58:58.370]  He just, I think he worded it wrong where he's saying basically he's going to focus on the congressional run.
[00:58:59.951 --> 00:59:00.972]  But it doesn't look good.
[00:59:01.012 --> 00:59:03.634]  Even though it's growing exponentially, they're just going to block it with election fraud.
[00:59:04.715 --> 00:59:06.797]  Let's continue trying to jam some calls in here.
[00:59:08.138 --> 00:59:10.540]  Let's go to Kyle in Bastrop, Texas.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.942]  You're on the air, Kyle.
[00:59:13.002 --> 00:59:14.023]  Thank you for holding.
[00:59:15.104 --> 00:59:16.605]  Hey Alex, happy birthday again.
[00:59:16.765 --> 00:59:17.146]  Thank you.
[00:59:18.335 --> 00:59:22.819]  Also, too, I just want to give a bit of insight to people who are complaining about the Ron Paul thing.
[00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:29.384]  I came from Friendswood, Texas, and he is needed in that district.
[00:59:30.345 --> 00:59:36.890]  I mean, when I was going to school there, a lot of the stuff you were talking about, the police state, stuff was going on.
[00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:44.376]  I mean, everybody there still believes in the false left-right paradigm, and he's waking people up to that, so he needs to defend that district.
[00:59:44.997 --> 00:59:47.359]  And I'm telling you, too, people, that
[00:59:48.061 --> 00:59:53.023]  The guy who's running against, who's going to try to run against Ron Paul, he is such a fake.
[00:59:54.244 --> 00:59:57.085]  Well he lied to Paul and promised he wouldn't run against him in the district.
[00:59:57.825 --> 01:00:05.749]  Oh yeah, I read that and also I decided to do a little bit more research on his issues and it's just off the charts.
[01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:13.392]  He's pro-war, he's earmarking for NASA and all that and just a whole bunch of
[01:00:14.076 --> 01:00:16.238]  You know, just take conservative values.
[01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:17.298]  Absolutely.
[01:00:17.338 --> 01:00:18.619]  They're coming after Paul.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:22.122]  Do we want them to be able to take his district?
[01:00:22.442 --> 01:00:24.443]  Do you want to give the New World Order that victory?
[01:00:25.004 --> 01:00:26.965]  We've got to support his congressional run.
[01:00:27.025 --> 01:00:32.289]  We asked him to run for president and we said we would support his congressional run as well if he did it.
[01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:35.191]  Look, we win by fighting.
[01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.052]  We win by showing up to the game.
[01:00:37.593 --> 01:00:39.154]  What did you expect in all of this?
[01:00:40.445 --> 01:00:44.347]  More people are talking about the New World Order now than ever were.
[01:00:44.607 --> 01:00:49.929]  Now we need to make sure all these people that have woken up don't get disenfranchised and just go back into the shadows.
[01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:55.231]  Everywhere Hillary goes, everywhere Barack Obama, everywhere McCain goes, they need to be confronted.
[01:00:55.772 --> 01:00:58.053]  Just like we are changing and others do, bringing up real issues.
[01:00:58.673 --> 01:01:01.034]  Raining on their parade and these staged events they're having.
[01:01:01.854 --> 01:01:03.355]  Everywhere they go.
[01:01:05.743 --> 01:01:07.925]  You need to form pro-Second Amendment groups.
[01:01:08.166 --> 01:01:10.188]  You need to form pro-property rights groups.
[01:01:10.408 --> 01:01:20.518]  You need to run on the Ron Paul bandwagon of liberty and freedom and pro-Constitution for county commissioner, city council, county clerk, dog catcher.
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:27.605]  We need good people to get in the government to block all the tyranny that the global corporates are bringing in.
[01:01:28.649 --> 01:01:30.130]  You know what they do with your city managers?
[01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:31.871]  They have the National Association of City Managers.
[01:01:32.052 --> 01:01:44.000]  They put them all on all-expense, first-class paid flights, five, six, seven, eight times a year, to big dinners in London, Berlin, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago.
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.102]  I mean, I'm talking, you know, $200 a plate dinners.
[01:01:48.328 --> 01:02:05.875]  And they take them, and this is all on record, and the corporates say, you're going to have all these jobs, just do these deals, do these bid riggings for us, invest here, invest your city funds here, let us do this, do this deal with us, pay your tax money into us, make your investments with us, and then we'll give you in five years when you get out this corporate job.
[01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:11.004]  They did the same thing with the city managers, the county commissioners, the city council people, the mayors.
[01:02:11.604 --> 01:02:13.705]  Man, it's so corrupt, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:13.886 --> 01:02:15.346]  They've sucked this country dry.
[01:02:15.586 --> 01:02:19.908]  Now they're printing money like it's going out of style, devaluing all your bank accounts, everything.
[01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:21.829]  The country's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:23.990]  We've got to stick together, move forward.
[01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:26.251]  The Liberty Revolution is taking over!
[01:02:27.232 --> 01:02:29.413]  There's a lot of positive things happening.
[01:02:29.753 --> 01:02:32.134]  I'm mad, too, about the campaign, but we've got to keep going!
[01:02:34.815 --> 01:02:36.996]  Four quarter game, we've only fought one quarter of this.
[01:02:37.616 --> 01:02:38.677]  We'll be right back, stay with me.
[01:02:38.697 --> 01:02:40.397]  More of your calls, tons of news straight ahead.
[01:02:40.777 --> 01:02:41.918]  It is a big idea.
[01:02:41.978 --> 01:02:43.098]  A new world order.
[01:02:43.178 --> 01:02:46.360]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.080]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:03:04.466 --> 01:03:06.708]  Both their objections being world domination.
[01:03:07.269 --> 01:03:09.711]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:03:10.431 --> 01:03:17.818]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:03:20.781 --> 01:03:25.765]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:03:26.245 --> 01:03:29.686]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:03:30.087 --> 01:03:32.187]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world.
[01:03:32.667 --> 01:03:33.808]  Most people have no idea.
[01:03:33.828 --> 01:03:34.608]  They're not after money.
[01:03:34.628 --> 01:03:35.689]  They have all the money they need.
[01:03:35.889 --> 01:03:36.649]  They're after power.
[01:03:36.869 --> 01:03:37.889]  That's what they're after.
[01:03:38.029 --> 01:03:45.812]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:45.912 --> 01:03:49.033]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:50.634]  You have been warned.
[01:03:51.503 --> 01:03:51.984]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:03:52.584 --> 01:03:54.265]  The world famine is in its third year.
[01:03:54.666 --> 01:03:56.787]  Our harvest is too small to get through the year.
[01:03:57.388 --> 01:04:04.234]  Genetically poisoned food, dangerous food imports, and constantly recalled disease-contaminated foods are mixed in with our safe food.
[01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:07.857]  Farm food production is turned into ethanol fuel.
[01:04:08.497 --> 01:04:09.178]  What should I do?
[01:04:09.698 --> 01:04:12.400]  How long can I afford food or till there's no food?
[01:04:12.981 --> 01:04:14.402]  How long before it's all poisoned?
[01:04:15.026 --> 01:04:17.268]  Will three years worth of food supply be enough?
[01:04:17.748 --> 01:04:21.191]  Or will it only postpone my trip to the population control breadline?
[01:04:21.651 --> 01:04:23.753]  Will it be okay to wait till after the holidays?
[01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:28.176]  I'll use what I didn't spend on Christmas for a something-is-better-than-nothing supply.
[01:04:28.656 --> 01:04:29.517]  I'll get the rest later.
[01:04:29.537 --> 01:04:30.838]  How long do I dare wait?
[01:04:31.653 --> 01:04:34.856]  I know I'll regret not starting sooner and not getting enough food.
[01:04:35.496 --> 01:04:37.638]  I have to decide while I still have a choice.
[01:04:38.118 --> 01:04:39.039]  Tell me what to do.
[01:04:39.699 --> 01:04:42.141]  Now take your own advice and call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:04:42.161 --> 01:04:42.321]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:04:52.317 --> 01:04:58.523]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:04:58.983 --> 01:05:06.750]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:14.937]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:05:15.257 --> 01:05:19.999]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:05:20.339 --> 01:05:25.041]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:05:25.561 --> 01:05:29.423]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:05:29.923 --> 01:05:30.923]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:05:31.003 --> 01:05:35.025]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:05:35.505 --> 01:05:39.888]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:05:40.408 --> 01:05:42.950]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:05:48.234 --> 01:05:48.614]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:05:48.874 --> 01:05:59.081]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:05:59.541 --> 01:06:04.344]  An entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:06:04.745 --> 01:06:15.432]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:06:15.812 --> 01:06:18.994]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:06:19.214 --> 01:06:26.719]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.241]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today.
[01:06:29.281 --> 01:06:31.122]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:06:57.074 --> 01:06:59.416]  Be sure to visit GTNLive.com today.
[01:07:03.079 --> 01:07:04.320]  Yeah!
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:09.564]  We're back live!
[01:07:10.765 --> 01:07:11.725]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:07:11.745 --> 01:07:17.470]  Alright, I want to get into the Willie Nelson news.
[01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:20.012]  Coming up in the next segment.
[01:07:20.892 --> 01:07:22.954]  And I want to get into some of these police state clips I've got.
[01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:26.736]  But let's rampage through your calls right now.
[01:07:27.177 --> 01:07:31.420]  Let's talk to, and I appreciate all of you calling by the way, Kevin in Minnesota.
[01:07:31.501 --> 01:07:32.101]  You're on the air.
[01:07:32.221 --> 01:07:32.802]  Thanks for holding.
[01:07:33.242 --> 01:07:36.104]  Alejandro Jones, bless you.
[01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:37.606]  Remember to breathe.
[01:07:37.986 --> 01:07:39.027]  We love you out here.
[01:07:39.047 --> 01:07:41.749]  I have to remember to breathe sometimes, actually.
[01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:43.711]  And I appreciate it when you don't.
[01:07:44.662 --> 01:07:47.843]  Because you're really going off and waking some of these minds up.
[01:07:48.524 --> 01:07:50.564]  And just a real quick story about myself.
[01:07:50.804 --> 01:07:56.327]  I was in the Kuwaiti oil crisis, got back, started getting sick, went to the VA.
[01:07:56.387 --> 01:07:58.007]  They said, it's all in your mind.
[01:07:58.027 --> 01:07:59.728]  Gave me a bunch of Moltren.
[01:08:00.248 --> 01:08:01.809]  Then I couldn't walk.
[01:08:02.149 --> 01:08:03.589]  Then they said I had arthritis.
[01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:05.590]  In three years, I was in a wheelchair.
[01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:07.731]  I met up with Joyce Riley.
[01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:10.592]  She gave me a copy of COINTELPRO.
[01:08:11.252 --> 01:08:12.513]  And I think you've read that one.
[01:08:13.579 --> 01:08:14.460]  All three volumes.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:15.540]  And then what did you do?
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:19.482]  Let me guess, take a high dose of antibiotics and it got the bioweapon out of you?
[01:08:19.782 --> 01:08:20.403]  Nope.
[01:08:21.223 --> 01:08:29.187]  Well, I went all natural and stuff and I fought and fought to get the doxycycline and all the tetracycline and they said I was nuts and crazy.
[01:08:29.628 --> 01:08:33.870]  I've had over 12 doctors in my whole VA experience.
[01:08:34.483 --> 01:08:40.968]  And every time I go through the whole routine of trying to wake them up, I then started following the spider web.
[01:08:41.128 --> 01:08:42.809]  So what ended up happening, long and short of it?
[01:08:42.969 --> 01:08:51.896]  Well, long and short of it, I rode my wheelchair 270 miles across the state of Minnesota to try to get Jesse Ventura and some of the other senators involved with it.
[01:08:52.416 --> 01:08:57.780]  But I'm up here in Moorhead, and I ran for mayor for the last two elections.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:07.808]  And people need to wake up because if they don't give a rat for the veterans, what do you think about the average Joe Schmoe?
[01:09:08.128 --> 01:09:08.789]  Absolutely.
[01:09:09.249 --> 01:09:13.272]  Look, there's a video of them blowing up the Kamasuya chemical weapons dump.
[01:09:13.813 --> 01:09:20.238]  It's been documented that the troops got some type of bioweapon into them, but they can't treat you because then they've got to pay you disability.
[01:09:20.758 --> 01:09:26.783]  Just like they said Agent Orange was good for you, now they have to admit it killed a bunch of people and maimed others and caused all those deformities.
[01:09:27.612 --> 01:09:30.795]  And they first said that the anthrax shot wasn't hurting the Tribs.
[01:09:30.855 --> 01:09:31.656]  Now they admit that.
[01:09:31.996 --> 01:09:33.377]  They're a bunch of liars!
[01:09:34.058 --> 01:09:35.179]  That's the point I keep making.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.822]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Chris in Philly.
[01:09:38.842 --> 01:09:40.003]  You're on the air, Chris.
[01:09:40.043 --> 01:09:40.444]  Go ahead.
[01:09:41.184 --> 01:09:41.645]  Hey, Alex.
[01:09:41.665 --> 01:09:42.185]  How's it going?
[01:09:42.205 --> 01:09:42.405]  Good.
[01:09:42.906 --> 01:09:46.769]  I just wanted to bring up something I've seen on the internet forums.
[01:09:46.989 --> 01:09:48.530]  It's about the Second Amendment.
[01:09:48.990 --> 01:10:03.782]  There's a group called Ammunition Accountability that is trying to pass legislation in California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Washington about registering all ammunition
[01:10:04.762 --> 01:10:05.883]  Uh, that's, uh, sold.
[01:10:05.903 --> 01:10:08.725]  They want to, like, laser inscribe it, all the ammunition.
[01:10:08.785 --> 01:10:10.506]  And then register you with it, yes.
[01:10:10.786 --> 01:10:11.587]  Yes, exactly.
[01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:17.050]  It's, it's kind of like the next step up from, uh, what, the law they passed in California with the micro-stamping.
[01:10:17.591 --> 01:10:18.932]  Absolutely, and that's a great point.
[01:10:18.952 --> 01:10:20.192]  Let me break down what's happening here.
[01:10:21.994 --> 01:10:25.556]  Your car is, according to California standards, the strongest in the nation.
[01:10:26.897 --> 01:10:29.939]  It's the same thing with your thermostats, everything else.
[01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:34.282]  So California's on the verge of passing a law that radio transmitters are to be in all
[01:10:35.207 --> 01:10:40.611]  Of the thermostats that are sold, the government will remote control and will control your heat, your heating and cooling.
[01:10:41.272 --> 01:10:41.812]  I'm not kidding.
[01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:43.173]  I'm not kidding.
[01:10:44.154 --> 01:10:45.275]  They're on the verge of passing it.
[01:10:46.155 --> 01:10:49.958]  The gun registration, the ammo registration, it's all happening.
[01:10:50.539 --> 01:10:52.380]  Gun dealers are being sued.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.161]  Gun manufacturers are being sued.
[01:10:55.022 --> 01:10:58.725]  The Republican Party, just with the Democrats, just passed the biggest gun control act ever.
[01:10:59.352 --> 01:11:06.296]  Where you're not a judge, a jury, you're not indicted, no due process, they just say you have a mental problem, no Second Amendment anymore.
[01:11:07.677 --> 01:11:13.200]  The Second Amendment that Bush tripled the funding of the BATF, the biggest federal building ever built, was built in D.C.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.381]  It just opened last year.
[01:11:14.981 --> 01:11:17.543]  They're just attacking gun dealers and people everywhere.
[01:11:17.603 --> 01:11:20.684]  No one knows because the neocons on radio won't talk about it.
[01:11:21.185 --> 01:11:23.586]  Just a reign of tyranny is now upon us.
[01:11:24.507 --> 01:11:27.889]  And if you want to defend the Second Amendment, now is the time.
[01:11:27.929 --> 01:11:28.509]  It's under attack.
[01:11:29.895 --> 01:11:36.279]  Let's go ahead and talk to Avion in Nashville.
[01:11:36.299 --> 01:11:36.840]  You're on the air.
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:37.280]  Go ahead.
[01:11:38.181 --> 01:11:39.241]  What up, Alex, man?
[01:11:39.281 --> 01:11:40.082]  I love you, bro.
[01:11:40.102 --> 01:11:40.823]  I love what you do.
[01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:43.664]  You woke me up, and you helped me wake up a lot of people, man.
[01:11:44.025 --> 01:11:45.246]  Well, I love all you guys out there.
[01:11:45.286 --> 01:11:45.906]  What's on your mind?
[01:11:45.926 --> 01:11:47.407]  You know, I was wondering.
[01:11:47.427 --> 01:11:52.991]  I had never voted before, and Ron Paul got message got to me, and I got out to the polls, and I looked at
[01:11:53.732 --> 01:12:07.875]  The ballot, and there were all these, uh, the names of the people that have already dropped off the ballot, you know, like, so Fred Thompson was on the ballot, and some other people, like Tom San Credo was on the ballot, and they had votes all, I mean, in their spots, I mean, upwards of, say, 20,000 votes.
[01:12:08.455 --> 01:12:13.576]  And I'm wondering why, like, why Rob Paul's not jumping on that whole New Hampshire thing and keeping that on the forefront, you know?
[01:12:13.596 --> 01:12:14.596]  Well, he can't do everything.
[01:12:14.617 --> 01:12:16.157]  He did say there was fraud in Louisiana.
[01:12:16.177 --> 01:12:18.157]  He won first place, the media said second.
[01:12:18.757 --> 01:12:21.378]  He got second place in Nevada, they said he didn't get that.
[01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:24.170]  In the news, but the state admitted he did.
[01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:25.430]  I mean, they just lie.
[01:12:26.011 --> 01:12:29.112]  You have to get the average person to be able to admit that there's massive fraud.
[01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:30.212]  Absolutely.
[01:12:30.452 --> 01:12:30.873]  Absolutely.
[01:12:31.133 --> 01:12:43.078]  But I would have loved, you know, in that debate that he had, the last one in Sydney, California, in the Reagan Center, if he just would have got up and walked away from just the disrespectful nature of that whole debate.
[01:12:43.738 --> 01:12:47.599]  And that would have been so powerful to the whole movement, because I think I was feeling it.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.580]  And I know everybody else had been feeling it.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.441]  Everybody was watching that.
[01:12:52.094 --> 01:12:52.894]  Yeah, the arrogance.
[01:12:53.234 --> 01:12:58.436]  And I want to tell all the people that think they're part of the establishment, the other talk show hosts and people, you're not part of the establishment.
[01:12:58.456 --> 01:12:59.636]  You're nothing to the New World Order.
[01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:02.657]  And a lot of them are celebrating that Ron Paul's campaign's in trouble.
[01:13:02.997 --> 01:13:06.418]  They're celebrating all this tyranny, because they think they're on the winning team.
[01:13:07.318 --> 01:13:09.079]  And then others do this out of just cowardice.
[01:13:09.099 --> 01:13:10.919]  They know the government's evil, so they decide to serve it.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.901]  Alrighty, let's talk to John in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[01:13:16.921 --> 01:13:17.761]  You're on the air, John.
[01:13:19.142 --> 01:13:19.662]  Hi, Howard.
[01:13:21.843 --> 01:13:24.624]  Yeah, it's great being able to talk to you.
[01:13:24.744 --> 01:13:34.329]  I'm not able to listen to you, Colin, during the week, listen to your podcast, so a lot of times I feel like I'm a day late on what's going on.
[01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:35.690]  Well, that's okay.
[01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:36.250]  Here you are.
[01:13:36.291 --> 01:13:36.991]  What's on your mind?
[01:13:38.692 --> 01:13:46.076]  I'm just frustrated like you are with, you know, everybody's lack of understanding.
[01:13:46.156 --> 01:13:49.258]  I really wish people understood things the way
[01:13:50.208 --> 01:13:50.868]  That we do.
[01:13:50.949 --> 01:14:04.097]  You really are blessed of God with your understanding and being able to truly understand all the massive information that you have.
[01:14:05.678 --> 01:14:10.981]  I mean, the Ron Paul Revolution is a miracle.
[01:14:11.001 --> 01:14:12.662]  I mean, it's monumental.
[01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:15.964]  Yeah, how far we've come, the people we've woken up, it's amazing.
[01:14:16.522 --> 01:14:18.543]  So of course they're cheating him in media time.
[01:14:18.583 --> 01:14:22.526]  Of course in all the debates he got a third or less of the time the other candidates got a piece.
[01:14:22.946 --> 01:14:23.787]  Of course they do.
[01:14:24.287 --> 01:14:26.789]  The world banking gangsters.
[01:14:27.309 --> 01:14:29.711]  Exactly, but now we've shown people that.
[01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:30.852]  Do I have time to jam in one more?
[01:14:32.298 --> 01:14:32.979]  And I'm going quick.
[01:14:33.019 --> 01:14:33.779]  I love all your calls.
[01:14:33.839 --> 01:14:36.960]  I'm sorry to have to move so fast, but I'll never get to any of you if I don't.
[01:14:37.301 --> 01:14:37.881]  J.D.
[01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:48.225]  in Mississippi, where the state's set to pass a law that you'll have to, without being paid if you own a restaurant, no longer is it just don't have salmonella, don't serve liquor to kids.
[01:14:48.626 --> 01:14:52.007]  Now it's you've got to have a tape measure, and if somebody's too overweight, you don't serve them.
[01:14:52.427 --> 01:14:53.728]  This is the new nanny state.
[01:14:54.728 --> 01:14:56.229]  And I just thought I'd mention that because J.D.'
[01:14:56.209 --> 01:14:57.189]  's calling from Mississippi.
[01:14:57.450 --> 01:14:58.210]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:14:59.219 --> 01:15:06.785]  Oh yeah, I called the Representative at his house and left a nice little message on his answering machine for him.
[01:15:08.006 --> 01:15:10.548]  But one thing, I wanted to run an idea past you.
[01:15:10.608 --> 01:15:11.149]  Go ahead.
[01:15:11.789 --> 01:15:22.879]  Is that, would it be a good idea for somebody out there listening, somebody in a good position to run as an independent if Ron Paul doesn't run as an independent?
[01:15:23.911 --> 01:15:29.355]  Maybe we could probably support him and get him in there, if he supports the Constitution, like Ron Paul has.
[01:15:29.415 --> 01:15:31.116]  Yes, and great question.
[01:15:31.536 --> 01:15:33.197]  Let me try to answer that on the other side.
[01:15:33.217 --> 01:15:38.520]  Then the Willie Nelson goes public on 9-11, being an inside job, and he's worried about martial law.
[01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:39.461]  That's coming up.
[01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:40.142]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:40.162 --> 01:15:45.725]  The website's yourtruthnews.us, infowars.com, new and redesigned, and prisonplanet.com.

[01:16:51.752 --> 01:16:54.174]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:16:54.474 --> 01:16:57.937]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:16:58.097 --> 01:16:59.979]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:17:00.559 --> 01:17:03.301]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:17:03.622 --> 01:17:09.126]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:17:09.407 --> 01:17:13.370]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:18.614]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:17:18.894 --> 01:17:21.656]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[01:17:21.977 --> 01:17:28.862]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.

[01:17:35.247 --> 01:17:39.791]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[01:17:40.091 --> 01:17:42.633]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[01:17:42.954 --> 01:17:44.635]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:46.797]  Burn the info bombs to dust.
[01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:48.839]  Put them on the file sharing networks.

[01:17:50.981 --> 01:17:52.362]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:17:52.662 --> 01:17:53.323]  It's a fact.
[01:17:53.523 --> 01:18:01.010]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:04.713]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates,
[01:18:04.853 --> 01:18:09.975]  It has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:18:10.255 --> 01:18:20.799]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:27.062]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:18:27.342 --> 01:18:32.343]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:18:32.543 --> 01:18:37.024]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:18:37.184 --> 01:18:38.985]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:18:39.005 --> 01:18:39.205]  That's 877-943-8600.

[01:18:41.766 --> 01:18:42.286]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[01:18:52.668 --> 01:18:53.529]  We're good to go.
[01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:14.259]  I think so.
[01:19:43.959 --> 01:19:46.300]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:51.481]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[01:19:55.463 --> 01:19:57.843]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:19:57.923 --> 01:19:59.064]  Well, search no more.
[01:19:59.184 --> 01:20:02.065]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:06.886 --> 01:20:09.607]  The last caller brought up a really important question.
[01:20:10.365 --> 01:20:14.188]  We know that there is unprecedented political realignment taking place.
[01:20:14.888 --> 01:20:18.771]  AP, the national poll, found Congress at a 20% approval rating.
[01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:20.893]  Bush has an all-time low.
[01:20:21.433 --> 01:20:24.535]  But I've got a Gallup poll showing Congress with an 11% approval rating.
[01:20:24.935 --> 01:20:26.577]  Regardless, it's the all-time low.
[01:20:27.998 --> 01:20:29.639]  And people don't like McCain.
[01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:30.760]  Conservatives don't like McCain.
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:32.421]  Most liberals I've talked to don't like Hillary.
[01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:34.422]  Why then are these the candidates?
[01:20:36.243 --> 01:20:38.205]  A mix of fraud, idiots voting.
[01:20:39.145 --> 01:20:39.566]  It's a mix.
[01:20:40.954 --> 01:20:42.915]  But should we have another third-party candidate?
[01:20:43.575 --> 01:20:49.678]  I certainly think there's a vacuum there that needs to be filled, but really, it's just the info war is what needs to be fought.
[01:20:50.659 --> 01:21:03.265]  Now, Willie Nelson is an icon, and Willie Nelson, you know what, I'm just going to play excerpts of the hour-long interview I did with him Monday, and then I'm going to come back after the break and comment on Willie Nelson.
[01:21:03.865 --> 01:21:06.066]  But he's got a lot of courage and he is to be commended.
[01:21:06.807 --> 01:21:15.130]  Um, for speaking out, knowing he would be attacked for what he said on the O'Reilly Factor and a lot of other newspapers and magazines, but he got a lot more support than he got negative attacks.
[01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:18.531]  The media tried to spin to, uh, clips what he said.
[01:21:19.091 --> 01:21:20.491]  Oh, he's saying no planes at the towers.
[01:21:20.511 --> 01:21:20.611]  No, no.
[01:21:20.631 --> 01:21:24.933]  He's talking about Tower 1 and 2, then he talks about Building 7, no plane hitting it.
[01:21:25.393 --> 01:21:30.675]  He said those buildings came down, what looked like a controlled demolition, and then nothing hit the other building, that's Building 7.
[01:21:30.735 --> 01:21:34.556]  So, uh, here's some excerpts of my interview with Willie Nelson.
[01:21:36.704 --> 01:21:38.865]  And then we'll come back and comment on it.
[01:21:38.965 --> 01:21:41.386]  Global icon and American institution.
[01:21:41.406 --> 01:21:44.767]  There's probably nothing more Americana.
[01:21:44.787 --> 01:21:46.668]  What symbolizes America and Texas?
[01:21:46.928 --> 01:21:48.968]  And it's Willie Nelson.
[01:21:49.649 --> 01:21:53.270]  Now both parties have circled the wagons against the people and they're saying, we don't care what you want.
[01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:55.911]  John McCain said this war is going to go on for a hundred years.
[01:21:56.671 --> 01:21:57.171]  Yeah.
[01:21:58.292 --> 01:21:58.532]  Yeah.
[01:21:58.732 --> 01:22:01.973]  And it can't.
[01:22:02.413 --> 01:22:03.213]  It just can't.
[01:22:03.614 --> 01:22:04.794]  We can't let it go on.
[01:22:06.314 --> 01:22:06.974]  Another year.
[01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:12.835]  The other day I was getting interviewed and somebody said, what would you do if you were elected president?
[01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:15.076]  I said, I would stop the damn war.
[01:22:15.796 --> 01:22:17.476]  And it's just that simple.
[01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:25.538]  You stop that war, you stop the other wars that were in and around the country, and you go around the country being a peacemaker and stopping wars.
[01:22:25.638 --> 01:22:27.238]  I thought that's what you're supposed to do.
[01:22:28.479 --> 01:22:32.179]  Since when does America invade all these countries that have nothing to do with 9-11?
[01:22:32.819 --> 01:22:33.700]  Yeah, really.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.080]  And all of a sudden,
[01:22:36.306 --> 01:22:43.069]  You know, the way I heard it, 15 people from Saudi Arabia hit us in New York and we go jump on Afghanistan.
[01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:46.150]  I never could figure that one out in Iraq.
[01:22:46.190 --> 01:22:50.312]  Well, I did figure it out, too, but I'm surprised more people haven't figured it out.
[01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:52.013]  Willie, you brought it up.
[01:22:52.053 --> 01:22:52.793]  You figured it out.
[01:22:52.833 --> 01:22:54.274]  What's your take on 9-11?
[01:22:54.534 --> 01:22:58.476]  It just came out in AP today that the White House was running the commission.
[01:22:58.516 --> 01:22:59.996]  We always knew that, but now they admit.
[01:23:00.016 --> 01:23:02.017]  In fact, I have the headline right here.
[01:23:02.037 --> 01:23:03.318]  I read it before you came on.
[01:23:04.236 --> 01:23:07.278]  Where they're now admitting it was a staged commission.
[01:23:09.519 --> 01:23:12.681]  Well, that ain't good news, but it doesn't surprise me.
[01:23:12.741 --> 01:23:13.221]  Did it you?
[01:23:14.542 --> 01:23:14.982]  No, it didn't.
[01:23:15.022 --> 01:23:16.023]  I'm glad it's coming out.
[01:23:16.543 --> 01:23:17.743]  What's your take on 9-11?
[01:23:18.344 --> 01:23:19.584]  Do you question the official story?
[01:23:20.545 --> 01:23:26.548]  I certainly do, and I saw those towers fall, and I've seen an implosion in Las Vegas.
[01:23:27.289 --> 01:23:29.530]  There was too much similarity between the two.
[01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:31.651]  And I saw the building fall.
[01:23:31.691 --> 01:23:32.912]  It didn't get hit by nothing.
[01:23:33.976 --> 01:23:35.877]  You know, how naive are we?
[01:23:35.897 --> 01:23:38.458]  What do they think we'll go for?
[01:23:39.198 --> 01:23:44.180]  So, are you saying you started having questions or that little voice in your head?
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.941]  I mean, did you have a bad feeling the day it happened?
[01:23:46.961 --> 01:23:47.541]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:23:47.801 --> 01:23:51.723]  The day it happened, I thought one fall and it was just so symmetrical.
[01:23:51.743 --> 01:23:58.505]  And I said, wait a minute, I just saw that last week at the casino over in Las Vegas.
[01:23:58.525 --> 01:24:00.426]  And you see these implosions all the time.
[01:24:00.446 --> 01:24:02.687]  And then the next one fell and there's another one.
[01:24:03.334 --> 01:24:07.395]  And they're trying to tell me that an airplane did it, and that's, you know, I can't go along with that.
[01:24:07.515 --> 01:24:15.457]  And then you find out that mainstream news reported, but it never got any attention, that the supposed hijackers were given national security clearance and were trained at U.S.
[01:24:15.497 --> 01:24:23.979]  bases, and the dean of the Defense Language School, Colonel Butler, goes public and says, we train these people, the government's involved, and they start court-martialing until he agreed to shut up.
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:27.240]  True story, I guess.
[01:24:27.921 --> 01:24:29.521]  I hate to hear it, but it's probably true.
[01:24:30.712 --> 01:24:34.075]  You've had a chance to see, what, Terror Storm, Endgame, some of the other films.
[01:24:34.155 --> 01:24:36.317]  What's Willie Elson's take on those films?
[01:24:37.618 --> 01:24:38.779]  Oh, I think they're right on.
[01:24:38.859 --> 01:24:49.648]  I think, you know, the fact that there are a few elite that are running everything, calling the shots, starting the wars, financing them all, I believe that.
[01:24:49.748 --> 01:24:52.731]  And what else they're doing, who knows?
[01:24:52.871 --> 01:24:58.816]  But that one thing alone is enough for us to think about how do we stop them.
[01:24:59.654 --> 01:25:00.855]  Well, the proof is in the pudding.
[01:25:00.975 --> 01:25:08.017]  If you've got, on every issue, 75 to 85, in all the major scientific polls, the people are against everything this government's doing.
[01:25:08.378 --> 01:25:10.358]  We send the Democrats to Congress to end the war.
[01:25:10.418 --> 01:25:11.159]  They increase it.
[01:25:12.179 --> 01:25:14.980]  And now they're saying they're going to be there 100 years, Hillary and McCain.
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:18.322]  I mean, to me, that is a small group running things right there in front of us.
[01:25:19.302 --> 01:25:19.882]  Absolutely.
[01:25:20.162 --> 01:25:26.045]  And as far as I can see, all those people attended the same meetings that you and the guys attended up in Canada.
[01:25:26.105 --> 01:25:26.625]  Am I wrong?
[01:25:26.885 --> 01:25:27.325]  Oh, no.
[01:25:27.385 --> 01:25:28.766]  A lot of them do go to the Bilderberg group.
[01:25:28.786 --> 01:25:29.026]  Yes, sir.
[01:25:29.628 --> 01:25:29.808]  Yeah.
[01:25:30.349 --> 01:25:30.950]  Is that freedom?
[01:25:31.732 --> 01:25:32.433]  I don't think so.
[01:25:33.355 --> 01:25:34.757]  It's not democracy either.
[01:25:37.742 --> 01:25:39.405]  Willie Nelson, you're blowing me away here.
[01:25:44.924 --> 01:25:56.012]  And it may be best in the news today, we're seeing that they've recruited 26,000 preachers the White House has in FEMA to tell their flocks to stand down in the Presidential Decision Directive 51.
[01:25:56.433 --> 01:25:58.074]  Bush says he's above the Congress.
[01:25:58.494 --> 01:26:02.197]  It's no longer involved in continuity of government in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:26:02.917 --> 01:26:07.221]  They had openly funded for insurrection and rebellion by the American people.
[01:26:07.661 --> 01:26:16.628]  The whole police state apparatus they built up after 9-11, and I want to get your take on this, Willie, because I know you're aware of it, is now being used against the people.
[01:26:16.949 --> 01:26:20.031]  They're not even talking about the boogeyman of Al-Qaeda anymore.
[01:26:23.783 --> 01:26:34.831]  No, and I do believe that it's a long time until election day and some sort of national crisis could put off the elections and we could have George in there ten years longer.
[01:26:36.172 --> 01:26:37.673]  A lot of people are saying that.
[01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:44.758]  I was saying that many years ago and now Bob Woodward's talked about others setting up for martial law, of all people.
[01:26:45.159 --> 01:26:47.080]  Naomi Wolf is talking about it.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:49.502]  I think that might save us.
[01:26:50.202 --> 01:26:50.843]  I'm seeing a
[01:26:51.443 --> 01:26:51.603]  Well...
[01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:23.801]  I would hope that we'd be smarter than that, and I would hope that, you know, we're throwing all you guys out and we're starting over.
[01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:28.303]  You know, you can stop the elections if you want to, but you can't stop the people.
[01:27:29.543 --> 01:27:37.807]  Well, Ron Paul has gotten more donations from troops and people in Iraq than all Republicans combined.
[01:27:37.827 --> 01:27:45.230]  The troops in polls, 75% are against the war, so if Bush is planning on using these troops here, it looks like he's going to have a problem.
[01:27:46.465 --> 01:27:52.407]  Well again the troops are under orders and if they don't obey the orders they get shot.
[01:27:52.487 --> 01:27:55.189]  So the troops have no choice.
[01:27:55.529 --> 01:27:59.850]  There's a few of them in there that are there because they think it's the right thing to do.
[01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:01.991]  There's a few there because they just like to fight.
[01:28:02.912 --> 01:28:06.313]  But there's a lot of them like you say that would rather be home with their families and
[01:28:06.812 --> 01:28:13.501]  Let's save our good men and women for something that really matters, for really something that is the defense of our country.
[01:28:13.862 --> 01:28:20.090]  If we need some people down here on the borders, let's take 150,000 people out of Iraq and put them on the borders of Canada and Mexico.
[01:28:20.291 --> 01:28:21.953]  We can secure our borders that way.
[01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:28.333]  Well, how do we have this war on terror where there's an Al-Qaeda terrorist under every bed, under every table?
[01:28:28.713 --> 01:28:35.136]  We've got to have checkpoints and kids getting thumbscanned to get their lunches to stop Al-Qaeda, but then the border's wide open.
[01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:37.277]  That kind of makes the war on terror look like a fraud.
[01:28:37.697 --> 01:28:44.760]  Well, yeah, and you know, they're fighting over there because you remember the old joke about the guy that dropped a quarter and he was looking around and he said, where did you lose it?
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.141]  I said, I lost it over yonder.
[01:28:46.161 --> 01:28:48.282]  And he said, what are you looking over here for?
[01:28:48.302 --> 01:28:49.543]  I said, well, I caught the light spreader.
[01:28:54.065 --> 01:28:56.126]  I think that's why they're over there with the lights better.
[01:28:57.466 --> 01:29:03.489]  Well, it's a black hole to launder money and dump trillions of dollars in no-bid contracts to Halliburton.
[01:29:04.829 --> 01:29:05.049]  Yeah.
[01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:07.870]  And there's nobody stopping it.
[01:29:08.771 --> 01:29:14.593]  And as long as it keeps going on and nobody stops it, I don't know what the end result will be.
[01:29:14.673 --> 01:29:17.514]  But it can't be good for us.
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.161]  Well, you're right.
[01:29:19.221 --> 01:29:20.822]  Tyrants have known throughout history.
[01:29:20.842 --> 01:29:21.522]  They keep pushing.
[01:29:21.822 --> 01:29:22.583]  They keep testing.
[01:29:22.623 --> 01:29:23.663]  Tyranny doesn't come overnight.
[01:29:23.683 --> 01:29:24.004]  All right, folks.
[01:29:24.024 --> 01:29:28.947]  We're going to come back and play about three or four more minutes of this, and I'm going to hit some martial law news that I've run out of time on.
[01:29:28.967 --> 01:29:31.108]  I'll have to cover more of it in the weeks to come.
[01:29:32.429 --> 01:29:34.070]  There's just so much of it that's the problem.
[01:29:35.410 --> 01:29:36.471]  This country's in a lot of trouble.
[01:29:36.491 --> 01:29:41.034]  The planet's in a lot of trouble, and Willie Nelson's got a lot of courage to come on my radio show and talk about those issues.
[01:29:41.734 --> 01:29:42.415]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:42.435 --> 01:29:42.815]  Stay with us.
[01:29:46.765 --> 01:29:47.026]  Yeah.
[01:29:52.339 --> 01:29:54.861]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:29:55.202 --> 01:29:56.483]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[01:29:56.763 --> 01:29:58.745]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:29:58.905 --> 01:30:00.647]  The Truth Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:30:00.807 --> 01:30:02.068]  The Late Great USA.
[01:30:02.288 --> 01:30:03.709]  America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:10.916]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.563]  Whether you're looking for survival and wellness products like Berkey water filters,
[01:30:18.863 --> 01:30:19.183]  We're good.
[01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:49.644]  We're good.
[01:31:08.248 --> 01:31:22.431]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:30.373]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[01:31:30.393 --> 01:31:33.754]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[01:31:34.134 --> 01:31:35.394]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[01:31:36.095 --> 01:31:36.796]  Decide now.
[01:31:37.297 --> 01:31:38.078]  Place your bet.
[01:31:38.859 --> 01:31:40.322]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[01:31:40.702 --> 01:31:41.984]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:42.004 --> 01:31:42.185]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:52.381 --> 01:31:56.942]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:31:57.343 --> 01:32:00.284]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:32:00.604 --> 01:32:03.164]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:32:03.525 --> 01:32:08.346]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:32:08.726 --> 01:32:14.088]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:32:14.388 --> 01:32:17.369]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:32:17.549 --> 01:32:18.109]  We're good to go.
[01:32:40.959 --> 01:32:48.821]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:32:48.981 --> 01:32:51.702]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:32:52.222 --> 01:32:52.863]  It's a fact.
[01:32:53.083 --> 01:33:04.266]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates
[01:33:04.406 --> 01:33:09.549]  It has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:33:09.809 --> 01:33:20.374]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:33:20.634 --> 01:33:26.697]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:33:26.897 --> 01:33:31.900]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debts.
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:36.584]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:38.465]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:33:38.505 --> 01:33:38.705]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:33:38.725 --> 01:33:39.146]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:33:39.186 --> 01:33:40.487]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:33:40.507 --> 01:33:41.047]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[01:33:41.087 --> 01:33:41.868]  Thank you for listening to GPN.
[01:33:41.888 --> 01:33:42.708]  Visit GPNlive.com today.
[01:34:07.678 --> 01:34:11.201]  Well, tyrants... They can't be good for us.
[01:34:11.281 --> 01:34:11.962]  Well, you're right.
[01:34:12.002 --> 01:34:13.603]  Tyrants have known throughout history.
[01:34:13.643 --> 01:34:14.323]  They keep pushing.
[01:34:14.624 --> 01:34:15.384]  They keep testing.
[01:34:15.424 --> 01:34:16.845]  Tyranny doesn't come overnight.
[01:34:17.406 --> 01:34:18.987]  And I hope a lot of people will support this war.
[01:34:19.007 --> 01:34:22.789]  I hope you know we have illegal wars not declared, torture, the rest of it.
[01:34:23.970 --> 01:34:24.991]  None of us are safe here.
[01:34:25.051 --> 01:34:26.092]  What comes around goes around.
[01:34:26.112 --> 01:34:27.293]  You reap what you sow, don't you, Willie?
[01:34:28.053 --> 01:34:28.774]  Absolutely.
[01:34:28.814 --> 01:34:30.235]  Ten times over, I remember.
[01:34:32.190 --> 01:34:40.957]  And I'm not sure I want to get treated ten times as bad as we're treating other people.
[01:34:43.138 --> 01:34:57.269]  Willie, getting back into 9-11, because you brought it up, and I was debating even bringing it up, it's so controversial, but other questions, other things that piqued your interest and made you question the official stories surrounding 9-11?
[01:35:01.104 --> 01:35:03.165]  It happened in the next day.
[01:35:03.245 --> 01:35:07.208]  I was somewhere doing a show and somebody said, What do you think about it?
[01:35:07.248 --> 01:35:15.193]  I said, Well, first of all, when I get hit, I like to look around and see who did it before I start swinging at everybody in the room.
[01:35:15.633 --> 01:35:18.015]  And it kind of looked like what we were doing.
[01:35:18.415 --> 01:35:22.558]  We get hit over here and the next thing you know, we're jumping on everybody in the town.
[01:35:22.938 --> 01:35:26.720]  So we got hit from Saudi Arabia.
[01:35:28.241 --> 01:35:29.242]  I think we have some
[01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:32.332]  Questions that need to be answered from those folks.
[01:35:32.732 --> 01:35:40.417]  Again, Newsweek reported a week after 9-11 that in the six months before, they had mass carrier task forces, 44,000 U.S.
[01:35:40.817 --> 01:35:50.363]  troops, 18,000 British troops in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan surrounding, and that Bush on September 10th signed the order in the next week to attack Afghanistan.
[01:35:50.403 --> 01:35:53.825]  Man, what timing, Willie, that he signed the attack order the day before!
[01:35:55.646 --> 01:35:57.107]  Yeah, I wonder how that happened.
[01:35:59.508 --> 01:36:01.889]  I mean, how smoking gun is that?
[01:36:02.889 --> 01:36:03.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:10.972]  I mean, what does it take for us to realize that, you know, we're having the wool pulled over our eyes one more time?
[01:36:13.753 --> 01:36:16.474]  You know, I just thought to play clips of that here today.
[01:36:16.655 --> 01:36:21.116]  And what we did is we set a camera up in the studio to videotape me interviewing Willie over the phone.
[01:36:21.136 --> 01:36:22.637]  So that's the audio off the camera.
[01:36:22.657 --> 01:36:23.737]  It's not even the best audio.
[01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:28.199]  Next week, we're going to air some of the other excerpts of the interview that you haven't heard.
[01:36:29.294 --> 01:36:32.537]  Next Sunday, in between the two hours, somewhere between 4 and 6 p.m.
[01:36:32.577 --> 01:36:52.874]  Central, because that's 5 to 7 for stations on the East Coast, 2 to 4 for folks in the Pacific area, 3 to 5 for listeners on mountain stations and the mountain time zone, but we're going to air that in a really good high quality that we've got it, because we've got a great recording of it, and we're going to play that maybe in its entirety next week.
[01:36:52.894 --> 01:36:53.535]  What do you think, Trey?
[01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:56.656]  Because a lot of people want to hear it, a lot of people missed it.
[01:36:56.676 --> 01:37:00.259]  There's more details on it at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:05.003]  Look, I know we have a lot of phone lines, and I want to go to all of you, but I also wanted to get into the Marshall Law news.
[01:37:07.165 --> 01:37:10.667]  Again, I had a whole bunch of these clips ready today, and my computer crashed.
[01:37:10.687 --> 01:37:11.848]  The hard drive is down.
[01:37:12.429 --> 01:37:13.710]  It is a broken computer now.
[01:37:14.010 --> 01:37:18.373]  As I get ready for this show at home, there's one reason I didn't have the high-quality Willie interview for you.
[01:37:18.393 --> 01:37:19.294]  I do a lot of this myself.
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:25.164]  And I found all these new clips of local newscasts where it shows the police training with the military.
[01:37:25.244 --> 01:37:26.485]  It said, for martial law.
[01:37:27.346 --> 01:37:43.879]  Now, a year and a half before this started coming out mainstream news, a pastor contacted me, a second pastor contacted me, and said, I've been trained, FEMA's approached me, because I have a big church, to tell my flock to submit to martial law, hand their guns in, take forced inoculations.
[01:37:44.039 --> 01:37:48.563]  People didn't believe me, even though I got the FEMA documents, posted them on InfoWars.com, and they're there right now.
[01:37:49.184 --> 01:37:52.068]  Just type FEMA recruiting preachers into Google, and it'll come up.
[01:37:52.909 --> 01:37:53.790]  That's all documents.
[01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:59.957]  But then, about a year after that, they admitted that they'd done it in New Orleans in the year before that happened.
[01:38:00.703 --> 01:38:07.207]  And then now, I've got these newscasts all over the country, but here is this short newscast where she says, Martial Law.
[01:38:07.507 --> 01:38:09.189]  It opens with the words, Martial Law.
[01:38:09.489 --> 01:38:09.869]  Here it is.
[01:38:26.095 --> 01:38:28.596]  From my cold, dead hand!
[01:38:28.716 --> 01:38:32.858]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value.
[01:38:33.299 --> 01:38:35.920]  The overarching desire to protect our freedoms.
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:42.843]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[01:38:43.544 --> 01:38:43.824]  U.S.
[01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:45.025]  troops also arrived.
[01:38:45.385 --> 01:38:52.128]  Something far easier to do even now, thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[01:38:52.608 --> 01:38:53.689]  That forbid U.S.
[01:38:53.749 --> 01:38:55.790]  troops from policing on American soil.
[01:38:58.021 --> 01:39:05.104]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[01:39:05.604 --> 01:39:11.187]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[01:39:11.267 --> 01:39:17.870]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is, let's go out there and get this thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:22.172]  Such Clergy Response Teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government,
[01:39:22.612 --> 01:39:23.973]  Versus the wishes of the public.
[01:39:24.473 --> 01:39:31.198]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to defuse that situation.
[01:39:31.599 --> 01:39:38.984]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the Bible itself.
[01:39:39.424 --> 01:39:40.865]  Specifically, Romans.
[01:39:41.366 --> 01:39:41.746]  Romans 13.
[01:39:41.806 --> 01:39:44.328]  Because the government's established out of order.
[01:39:45.063 --> 01:39:45.363]  You know?
[01:39:45.683 --> 01:39:47.324]  And that's what we believe in the Christian faith.
[01:39:47.344 --> 01:39:48.564]  That's what's stated in the scripture.
[01:39:49.144 --> 01:39:57.986]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how long they expect the suspension of their rights might last.
[01:39:58.966 --> 01:40:00.606]  Jeff Ferrell, KSLI News 12 reporting.
[01:40:01.446 --> 01:40:08.748]  According to Tuberville, during Hurricane Katrina, the clergy response team provided 38 chaplains a day around the clock at eight different camps.
[01:40:09.545 --> 01:40:10.266]  Eight different camps.
[01:40:10.306 --> 01:40:13.629]  For some reason, that computer is cutting off the first two seconds, the last two seconds.
[01:40:13.949 --> 01:40:14.750]  Try to play it again.
[01:40:15.250 --> 01:40:18.533]  I want listeners to hear it because the newscast starts with the words, Marshall Law.
[01:40:18.573 --> 01:40:18.994]  Try it again.
[01:40:19.234 --> 01:40:22.337]  Law ever become a reality in America?
[01:40:23.458 --> 01:40:25.099]  Law ever become a reality?
[01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:25.820]  Computers are weird.
[01:40:26.741 --> 01:40:27.502]  It doesn't matter.
[01:40:27.542 --> 01:40:30.304]  They start the newscast out with, Will Marshall Law ever be?
[01:40:30.584 --> 01:40:31.785]  Then it ends with, In the camps.
[01:40:31.886 --> 01:40:33.407]  Now, I want to explain to you.
[01:40:34.150 --> 01:40:39.756]  Long before 9-11, I went to urban warfare drills, and the Marines, the Army, I've been to a bunch of these.
[01:40:39.816 --> 01:40:41.638]  Enlisters have sent me video from all over the country.
[01:40:42.178 --> 01:40:44.200]  Training to take your guns and put you in camps.
[01:40:44.581 --> 01:40:45.802]  They don't say it's for Al-Qaeda.
[01:40:45.822 --> 01:40:47.043]  They don't say it's for foreign countries.
[01:40:47.343 --> 01:40:48.885]  It's for the general public.
[01:40:50.126 --> 01:40:51.648]  Why are they gearing up for this?
[01:40:51.788 --> 01:40:52.689]  Why are they doing it?
[01:40:52.889 --> 01:40:56.973]  And then putting out newscasts about the needs of the government versus the needs of the people.
[01:40:57.699 --> 01:40:59.741]  Then they say Posse Comitatus was overthrown.
[01:41:00.181 --> 01:41:01.502]  It wasn't overthrown by Congress.
[01:41:01.903 --> 01:41:04.585]  Bush signed an executive order saying it doesn't exist anymore.
[01:41:04.605 --> 01:41:06.787]  He says he's above Congress!
[01:41:07.748 --> 01:41:09.769]  And that means Hillary Clinton, when she gets in, will be.
[01:41:11.771 --> 01:41:13.753]  Presidential Decision Directive 51.
[01:41:13.813 --> 01:41:16.335]  You cannot make this type of stuff up.
[01:41:16.815 --> 01:41:20.999]  And then I have all of these articles in front of me.
[01:41:24.144 --> 01:41:25.945]  I mean, I've got stories here that just blow me away.
[01:41:25.985 --> 01:41:27.586]  Here's one out of the Boston Globe.
[01:41:28.386 --> 01:41:30.587]  Police set to search for guns at homes.
[01:41:30.607 --> 01:41:38.811]  It says a new program will start on Monday as police go to private homes and ask if they can search for illegal guns without a warrant.
[01:41:39.071 --> 01:41:46.255]  Officials are trying to pitch the idea of a plan as friendly cooperation between residents who still see it as a threatening intrusion.
[01:41:46.675 --> 01:41:48.676]  Now, by the way, you think Boston just started with this?
[01:41:49.565 --> 01:41:50.666]  It's called Knock and Talk.
[01:41:50.786 --> 01:41:51.166]  Google it.
[01:41:51.707 --> 01:41:54.409]  Started in Tucson, Arizona, as far as we can tell, ten years ago.
[01:41:54.729 --> 01:41:56.951]  It's been in suburbs of Dallas for at least six.
[01:41:57.511 --> 01:41:59.253]  I've talked to people, I've had guests on.
[01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:06.399]  They normally do it during the middle of the day, upper middle class areas, where you've got housewives who are home, you know, with middle class husbands off working.
[01:42:06.619 --> 01:42:11.763]  They come to the door and they say, Hello ma'am, we're here to search the house for illegal guns.
[01:42:12.323 --> 01:42:19.229]  And 95% of the time the women just go, okay, and they go into your medicine cabinets and they just go down the street.
[01:42:19.781 --> 01:42:27.227]  Now, again, total violation of the Fourth Amendment, but they say, oh, we just come and ask for them to let us in.
[01:42:29.249 --> 01:42:30.570]  Now, that's not America.
[01:42:30.650 --> 01:42:43.320]  By the way, the illegal aliens, I've had Austin cops tell me, it's been in the news, they're told, in fact, sheriffs have gone public all over the country, I've interviewed them, that they'll arrest illegal aliens for driving drunk, no driver's license, and ICE will say, just turn them loose.
[01:42:43.661 --> 01:42:45.002]  The feds won't even come pick them up.
[01:42:46.112 --> 01:42:49.293]  The illegal aliens get bank accounts without ID cards.
[01:42:49.753 --> 01:42:53.695]  I first saw this six years ago myself at Bank of America when I was setting up an account.
[01:42:54.055 --> 01:42:54.996]  I had to have three forms.
[01:42:55.036 --> 01:42:55.856]  They had to have nothing.
[01:42:56.156 --> 01:42:57.397]  Then it's been in the news now.
[01:42:58.697 --> 01:42:59.697]  I didn't need the news to tell me.
[01:42:59.757 --> 01:43:00.218]  I saw it.
[01:43:02.358 --> 01:43:04.539]  So all these illegal aliens have got rights.
[01:43:04.599 --> 01:43:06.060]  The point is they're selectively enforcing.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:11.602]  But then they're going to come to your door and say, hey, I want to search.
[01:43:11.642 --> 01:43:13.043]  Well, what do you have to hide, ma'am?
[01:43:13.063 --> 01:43:13.563]  Let me in.
[01:43:15.054 --> 01:43:15.634]  Let me in!
[01:43:15.855 --> 01:43:16.995]  Go look it up for yourself.
[01:43:17.616 --> 01:43:19.857]  They're practicing the destruction of America.
[01:43:20.597 --> 01:43:21.958]  And I'm not bashing police!
[01:43:22.258 --> 01:43:23.419]  What you're doing is wrong!
[01:43:23.939 --> 01:43:24.820]  I got stories right here.
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:30.003]  Every time there's a serial killer on the loose, they set up random checkpoints and take people's DNA out of their cheeks.
[01:43:30.383 --> 01:43:31.964]  The tissue out of the side of your cheek.
[01:43:32.645 --> 01:43:33.965]  This is out of Local News 6.
[01:43:34.946 --> 01:43:36.347]  DNA swabbed drivers.
[01:43:36.687 --> 01:43:41.670]  Police in Daytona Beach are swabbing the mouths of people during traffic stops with special DNA kits.
[01:43:43.111 --> 01:43:44.652]  Genetically, we know who he is.
[01:43:45.413 --> 01:43:49.275]  Chitwood said we have DNA evidence for the murder scenes so we've got that.
[01:43:49.716 --> 01:43:55.799]  This is never going to go away and sooner or later we will match the DNA for the physical person and bring closure to everything that's going on.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.181]  And it goes on to say that there's a serial killer killing women.
[01:44:00.902 --> 01:44:02.283]  What about the Fourth Amendment?
[01:44:03.364 --> 01:44:05.205]  The serial killer can move out of the town!
[01:44:06.385 --> 01:44:10.488]  And I've got stories where the cops are looking for alcohol now in Denver and other places
[01:44:12.003 --> 01:44:13.403]  Phoenix, Arizona, Arizona.
[01:44:13.423 --> 01:44:16.324]  Again, they demand blood at flashlight point.
[01:44:16.624 --> 01:44:17.825]  Stickin' needles in ya!
[01:44:18.805 --> 01:44:21.026]  Forget show your papers, show your DNA!
[01:44:21.406 --> 01:44:22.426]  That's not freedom.
[01:44:22.806 --> 01:44:23.667]  That's not liberty.
[01:44:23.707 --> 01:44:26.187]  And folks, I had a giant stack of this stuff.
[01:44:26.667 --> 01:44:28.088]  I never even got to tonight.
[01:44:28.928 --> 01:44:30.529]  We'll see you at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:30.889 --> 01:44:33.730]  Weekday show, we'll see you back here next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:44:34.050 --> 01:44:35.750]  God bless you all, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:38.651]  This is hardcore military-industrial complex takeover.
[01:44:38.851 --> 01:44:39.751]  They're testing you.
[01:44:39.831 --> 01:44:40.492]  They're pushing.
[01:44:40.692 --> 01:44:41.512]  And it's criminal!
[01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:43.436]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:44:43.536 --> 01:44:48.338]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[01:44:48.458 --> 01:44:51.359]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[01:44:51.479 --> 01:44:55.501]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[01:44:55.801 --> 01:45:01.823]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[01:45:02.003 --> 01:45:03.563]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:03.603 --> 01:45:05.984]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:13.248 --> 01:45:15.729]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:45:16.190 --> 01:45:18.111]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:45:18.811 --> 01:45:21.973]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:45:22.633 --> 01:45:29.117]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:45:29.877 --> 01:45:32.098]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.

[01:45:33.959 --> 01:45:34.519]  It's progressing.
