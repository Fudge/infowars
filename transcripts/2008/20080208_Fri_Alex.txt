[00:00:05.575 --> 00:00:06.236]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.876 --> 00:00:07.957]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.657 --> 00:00:09.758]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.418 --> 00:00:11.219]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.921]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:17.203]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.744 --> 00:00:21.826]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.337 --> 00:00:50.346]  We've got election news, we've got civilian auxiliaries engaging in quote law enforcement against us the civilians using military terminology against the American people.
[00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:54.769]  We have serious Iran developments, we have
[00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.810]  Information on the economy.
[00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.533]  I want to comment on six dead as Gunman goes to war with Missouri City.
[00:01:02.553 --> 00:01:11.700]  I have a whole host of important news and information that we will be covering in the next three hours today.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.124]  But I do want to have a wider discussion with you, the audience, about where Ron Paul should go from here.
[00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:22.467]  Should he wait around and try to get maybe 10% of the delegates?
[00:01:24.222 --> 00:01:32.031]  Uh, as the race narrows between Paul Huckabee and, of course, John, the Manchurian candidate, McCain?
[00:01:34.214 --> 00:01:38.379]  Or should he go ahead and prepare, at least make more hints, towards running for a third party?
[00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:42.565]  We can discuss all the angles.
[00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:49.431]  I want to hear from you, the listeners, about what you think the Ron Paul campaign should do at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:56.756]  We're getting to this discussion early in this hour, because if I push it back, we'll never get to it.
[00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.158]  I specifically want to talk about that.
[00:01:59.178 --> 00:02:07.305]  You're welcome to call in about anything else you... whatever you'd like to discuss.
[00:02:10.094 --> 00:02:16.737]  I just paused there because I was looking at headlines scrolling on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:16.797 --> 00:02:18.878]  We have a little scrolling headline thing there now.
[00:02:18.898 --> 00:02:20.939]  I'm just reading about the police.
[00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:26.501]  If you even talk to them, respond back in a way they don't want, they now are told to taser you.
[00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.423]  It's just getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
[00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:34.585]  But here is just some of the news I have in front of me.
[00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:36.486]  I've also got a bunch of important audio clips.
[00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:46.483]  I want to play some excerpts of Ron Paul yesterday to a major conservative body here in the country, one of the most powerful organizations, and his speech.
[00:02:46.503 --> 00:02:47.743]  I want to play some excerpts of that.
[00:02:47.763 --> 00:02:49.183]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:02:49.223 --> 00:02:51.203]  Also, the sun had continued to have one of its hottest cycles.
[00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:52.023]  That is the most radiation.
[00:03:07.378 --> 00:03:10.201]  The most heat being put off in the last 20 years.
[00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:15.886]  It has about an 11 and a half year cycle and for two cycles it was the brightest ever on record.
[00:03:16.527 --> 00:03:24.254]  Now suddenly it has massively cooled according to NASA and other universities and institutions that study it.
[00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:30.650]  And they have been getting sunspot and heat resonance readings from the sun for more than 300 years.
[00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.413]  It's one of the most studied things in the historical record.
[00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:40.118]  And the last time they saw this, it signaled a mini ice age in the 17th century.
[00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.400]  So you've been enjoying the warm weather.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:54.749]  Well, according to these findings, and these are very prestigious institutions, the sun again got really bright and then now suddenly has dimmed.
[00:03:56.118 --> 00:03:56.798]  That's what it does.
[00:03:56.858 --> 00:04:00.659]  It's a huge atomic furnace.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.301]  Also, Bush, as said on Israeli television, admits he plans to attack Iran.
[00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:13.243]  We have other cryptic statements going back a few weeks before that, so we'll be going over that.
[00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:18.444]  Economic news, retailers report it's the worst January in nearly 40 years.
[00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:21.845]  Police are swabbing mouths during traffic stops.
[00:04:22.498 --> 00:04:26.399]  Now, they did this in Louisiana, they did this in California a few years ago.
[00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:34.241]  The precedence being set to where they just randomly pull people over and start demanding their DNA.
[00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:35.781]  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:41.663]  I mean, if you think that person is a serial killer, you take them in under probable cause.
[00:04:42.343 --> 00:04:45.043]  You don't just line the highway up and start swabbing mouths.
[00:04:45.684 --> 00:04:47.984]  Just absolute violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:04:48.404 --> 00:04:51.685]  It's not just show your papers now, it's show your DNA.
[00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:54.822]  And they tell us that's freedom.
[00:04:55.302 --> 00:04:56.422]  That's going to be a hard sell.
[00:04:57.323 --> 00:04:57.843]  All right!
[00:04:57.983 --> 00:04:59.583]  A lot of info straight ahead!
[00:04:59.623 --> 00:05:00.904]  Big Friday broadcast!
[00:05:01.364 --> 00:05:07.026]  Now that we are in the midst of the presidential primaries, Republican candidate Ron Paul needs our support more than ever.
[00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:14.548]  Ron Paul stands for the issues that need to be addressed and not glossed over and forgotten like the globalist crowd being fielded, unlike other candidates.
[00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:15.148]  We're good.
[00:05:30.838 --> 00:05:32.699]  Show your support for Ron Paul today.

[00:05:44.863 --> 00:05:46.084]  Support Ron Paul.
[00:05:46.344 --> 00:05:49.305]  Take the stand for the traditional values that America needs.

[00:05:55.947 --> 00:05:56.527]  Stand up.
[00:05:56.888 --> 00:05:58.068]  Now is the time to act.
[00:06:01.184 --> 00:06:02.585]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:02.605 --> 00:06:04.707]  A new world order.
[00:06:05.427 --> 00:06:09.711]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:13.114]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:15.395]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:15.936 --> 00:06:18.318]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:26.528]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:34.397]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:34.917 --> 00:06:38.379]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.280]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.460]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:43.261]  They're not after money.
[00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:44.341]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:44.982]  They're after power.
[00:06:45.002 --> 00:06:46.262]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[00:07:56.359 --> 00:07:59.000]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.760]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.101]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.631 --> 00:08:22.096]  This has been quite a week, ladies and gentlemen, quite a week with Willie Nelson on Monday.
[00:08:22.116 --> 00:08:27.099]  We've been so busy with other news stories, we haven't talked much about that.
[00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:29.601]  You're welcome to comment on that interview, what you thought of it.
[00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:33.184]  Are more big celebrities going to be going public on 9-11 Truth?
[00:08:34.164 --> 00:08:39.308]  I know there's several really big fish of the Willie Nelson icon level
[00:08:40.217 --> 00:08:45.760]  That have told me in past months, they are strongly considering going public.
[00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:49.841]  But we owe a lot of it to Charlie Sheen.
[00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:52.443]  People then say, well, who cares what celebrities think?
[00:08:53.243 --> 00:08:55.084]  The point is, is they know they're going to get heat.
[00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.825]  They're talking about a very controversial issue.
[00:08:57.925 --> 00:09:00.266]  It brings massive attention to it.
[00:09:00.766 --> 00:09:05.108]  And frankly, getting a chance to meet and talk to these individuals, I found that they are extraordinary.
[00:09:05.729 --> 00:09:06.829]  They're very intelligent.
[00:09:07.229 --> 00:09:08.310]  They're very informed.
[00:09:09.395 --> 00:09:13.198]  And that's why they have the star appeal that they do.
[00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:18.442]  You think he can be the type of guitar player Willie Nelson is with the skill or write the lyrics he writes?
[00:09:19.423 --> 00:09:21.324]  I mean, he's one of the biggest songwriters.
[00:09:21.384 --> 00:09:23.706]  In fact, he's made more money writing songs.
[00:09:24.266 --> 00:09:25.947]  You know, he wrote Patsy Cline's Crazy.
[00:09:26.468 --> 00:09:30.571]  You know how many hits, rock and roll hits, it doesn't matter, Willie Nelson has written?
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.981]  He's a poet, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:34.521 --> 00:09:39.443]  I'm not trying to grovel at Willie Nelson's feet to find out he's been listening to this show for more than a decade.
[00:09:40.504 --> 00:09:41.905]  By the way, I knew that a few months ago.
[00:09:42.625 --> 00:09:45.386]  Willie Nelson didn't say, hey, don't go on air and talk about this.
[00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:51.849]  I just... I wasn't going to come on air and talk about my discussions with Willie Nelson.
[00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:58.233]  I wasn't going to come on air and A, people might not believe it, and C, I just don't do that.
[00:09:58.773 --> 00:10:01.054]  If big shots in the corporate world
[00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:06.336]  Or big shots in any facet of society.
[00:10:06.836 --> 00:10:11.757]  Tell me info, and then don't say, hey, go ahead and tell whoever you want about this.
[00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:14.558]  I mean, if they don't volunteer that, I don't talk about it.
[00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:20.259]  And I haven't even really hunted down these people.
[00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:21.900]  Most of them have come to us.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.961]  I can't imagine how many of their emails and phone calls we've missed.
[00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:27.381]  Who knows who's called this office?
[00:10:28.301 --> 00:10:29.142]  I know Charlie Sheen.
[00:10:29.182 --> 00:10:30.542]  It took him weeks to get ahold of us.
[00:10:31.687 --> 00:10:34.748]  I know that Paris have been trying to get a hold of me for years.
[00:10:36.849 --> 00:10:38.190]  Years trying to get a hold of me.
[00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.050]  You know, I've got to get better at that.
[00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:47.193]  I've got to get a lot better at that because it's important.
[00:10:47.773 --> 00:10:48.494]  It is important.
[00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:52.855]  You know, this corporate system loves to sell their New World Order through celebrities.
[00:10:53.216 --> 00:10:56.837]  When celebrities don't tell their line, they say, oh, who cares about celebrities?
[00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:06.984]  So what a week, and you can better believe in the next few weeks you're going to have some more big surprise guests.
[00:11:07.004 --> 00:11:09.505]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:15.469]  And for other patriots and talk show hosts that get real jealous, you shouldn't.
[00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.531]  I bring most people into this movement.
[00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:20.353]  My listeners bring most of the people into this movement.
[00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:27.678]  As Ron Paul has volunteered here on the show, he said half his supporters plus are from this show, six months into his campaign.
[00:11:29.141 --> 00:11:30.542]  You ought to be happy I'm here.
[00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.685]  And you ought to be happy my audience is here.
[00:11:36.868 --> 00:11:45.036]  I mean, I have the distinct pleasure of pulling most of these other patriot bigwigs in the wagon and then being whipped as they sit in the buggy chair behind me.
[00:11:46.978 --> 00:11:53.004]  But it's just so exciting to know that so many prominent people tune into this broadcast on a weekly basis.
[00:11:53.584 --> 00:11:54.385]  And it is humbling.
[00:11:55.445 --> 00:12:15.291]  I certainly don't think of myself as a grand poobah or a know-it-all, and it's very daunting, very chilling or bracing or sobering, I would say is the word, to realize the effect we're having together.
[00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:21.973]  Because without you, the listeners, without you, the people on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we are nothing.
[00:12:23.178 --> 00:12:25.519]  I would have no effect if it wasn't for you.
[00:12:25.739 --> 00:12:27.680]  I have the great activist audience.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:38.044]  Remember Greg Palast, BBC presenter, ABC News presenter, done all these investigative reports, written these books, and he'll tell you this show is where he gets the biggest response.
[00:12:38.544 --> 00:12:49.788]  He'll put out IMF World Bank documents for two months, put it out on BBC, it gets no traction, he comes on here, a listener makes a transcript of the interview, and it was published in over 500 global newspapers.
[00:12:56.187 --> 00:12:57.988]  Because of you.
[00:12:58.188 --> 00:13:00.689]  Because you are an activist audience.
[00:13:00.729 --> 00:13:25.662]  So I ask you, kind of the hive mind, this private, public, open source, intelligence network, all your great intellects, your minds, integrating with the hillbilly from Texas, Alex Jones, here, I want to know what you think Ron Paul should do.
[00:13:27.117 --> 00:13:29.539]  I want to know where you think Ron Paul should go.
[00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:34.922]  You know, I'm trying to sit here and not throw my weight around and say what I think should happen.
[00:13:34.962 --> 00:13:38.684]  I'm pretty much made up my mind looking at all of the factors.
[00:13:40.565 --> 00:13:43.066]  And I support the campaign.
[00:13:43.106 --> 00:13:44.647]  I don't Monday morning quarterback them.
[00:13:45.108 --> 00:13:46.568]  I think they've done a fabulous job.
[00:13:47.049 --> 00:13:47.849]  They've made mistakes.
[00:13:47.909 --> 00:13:48.650]  We've made mistakes.
[00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.690]  Everybody makes mistakes.
[00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:52.572]  But I do see kind of a
[00:13:56.952 --> 00:14:08.004]  Deer in the headlights look right now from the campaign and I want to walk through that today.
[00:14:08.024 --> 00:14:09.986]  I mean later I'll give you my view on the situation.
[00:14:14.472 --> 00:14:22.336]  Minutes or hours, hours or days, days or weeks or months in this, and the campaign does need to announce a vice presidential running mate.
[00:14:22.416 --> 00:14:27.338]  I know they're not supposed to do that until they win a nomination, but, you know, anything to get attention.
[00:14:28.018 --> 00:14:36.762]  They need to put out a strategy of how they are going to win the nomination with a fraction of the delegates.
[00:14:38.363 --> 00:14:42.525]  I guess the strategy is, let's keep getting the word out and let's win in other states.
[00:14:43.695 --> 00:14:46.217]  We already have a large portion of the delegates out there.
[00:14:47.058 --> 00:14:48.839]  It's clear that there's fraud coast-to-coast.
[00:14:48.859 --> 00:14:50.821]  I mean, it's confirmed in New York, in many areas.
[00:14:51.101 --> 00:14:52.262]  He just wasn't on the ballot.
[00:14:55.484 --> 00:14:59.327]  People trying to vote were told, just, he's not on the ballot, he's dropped out.
[00:15:00.869 --> 00:15:04.451]  Kind of like Mark Twain said, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:09.255]  Talk of a brokered convention, I mean, Mitt Romney's dropped out.
[00:15:09.295 --> 00:15:10.376]  People are saying, oh my gosh!
[00:15:10.736 --> 00:15:11.717]  Now it's a three-way race!
[00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:12.838]  Ron Paul will do even better!
[00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:16.961]  And he might, instead of getting 10% in some of these states, he might get 25%.
[00:15:18.822 --> 00:15:23.945]  But still, and scandals could come out and cripple McCain.
[00:15:26.386 --> 00:15:39.153]  And then it's Paul and Huckabee, but Huckabee has been losing to Paul in some states, winning in others, so I could see how we could gamble and hope something happens here.
[00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:42.095]  But I'd say it's a
[00:15:43.267 --> 00:15:48.430]  20% chance or so that McCain... I mean, the scandals are out there.
[00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.931]  The media is not covering them.
[00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:54.554]  The Democrats are going to wait until he gets the nomination to take the gloves off.
[00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:56.815]  And then he does have a glass jaw.
[00:15:57.076 --> 00:15:59.697]  That's why they're putting McCain in the arena with Hillary.
[00:16:01.738 --> 00:16:02.999]  They're in business together.
[00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:06.621]  They... His wife campaigns for... It's an intelligence op.
[00:16:08.943 --> 00:16:12.445]  That's basically where I stand on the situation.
[00:16:14.207 --> 00:16:16.428]  But I do want to hear what you have to say.
[00:16:16.548 --> 00:16:19.290]  Ahmad in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:19.690]  Go ahead.
[00:16:23.532 --> 00:16:24.113]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:16:25.473 --> 00:16:26.014]  You can talk.
[00:16:26.494 --> 00:16:29.636]  Okay, let's move on to Wayne in Missouri.
[00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:30.436]  Wayne, you're on the air.
[00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:32.377]  Hi.
[00:16:32.757 --> 00:16:32.997]  Hi.
[00:16:33.898 --> 00:16:34.418]  I'm Pat.
[00:16:35.199 --> 00:16:37.380]  Okay, maybe we got some calls scrambled this morning.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.220]  Maybe that's what's going on.
[00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:39.241]  Go ahead, Pat.
[00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:43.083]  I've been listening while I've been waiting here on hold.
[00:16:43.695 --> 00:16:48.197]  I think Ron Paul will make the right decision at the time.
[00:16:48.217 --> 00:16:53.898]  I know you saw the CPAC speech.
[00:16:55.919 --> 00:17:02.881]  Did you notice the great difference in the way he talked yesterday at that speech from other speeches in the past?
[00:17:03.361 --> 00:17:06.442]  I think he's starting to really get serious about winning.
[00:17:08.815 --> 00:17:21.419]  I have no doubt that he can and will win if he puts his mind to it, but I was thinking maybe he's just a little bit scared because maybe he's not ready to be killed.
[00:17:21.879 --> 00:17:25.120]  Well, Ron Paul has something Ross Perot didn't.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.421]  Ron Paul is a proven earner.
[00:17:27.481 --> 00:17:29.602]  If he puts a plan forward, people will give.
[00:17:30.502 --> 00:17:33.523]  Right now you see the giving really slowing because people don't know what the plan is.
[00:17:35.663 --> 00:17:46.769]  He's got money that Perot had, but he's also got a grassroots army, the likes of which we've never seen, and that's why he could run successfully.
[00:17:47.589 --> 00:17:54.853]  All the major third parties are saying they would fuse Constitution, Libertarian, others with their infrastructure.
[00:17:55.513 --> 00:18:00.755]  And if he does it soon, he would have time to build up a formidable third-party run.
[00:18:01.075 --> 00:18:03.536]  If he waits until the convention, there won't be time.
[00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:06.197]  And so, he has to make the decision soon.
[00:18:06.257 --> 00:18:07.358]  He's probably already made it.
[00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:15.901]  Maybe he's going to gamble and hope something happens to McCain, scandal-wise, and that it'll be him and Huckabee, and that somehow he will beat Huckabee.
[00:18:16.902 --> 00:18:20.024]  That is a gamble, but so be it.
[00:18:20.525 --> 00:18:32.756]  Ron Paul guaranteed wins if he runs third party because he will stay in throughout the election putting the message of liberty and freedom and exposing the North American Union, exposing the war as a fraud.
[00:18:33.036 --> 00:18:38.161]  He will be able to talk about the inflation tax, the currency tax as that gets worse.
[00:18:39.121 --> 00:18:41.463]  And who knows what's going to unravel later this year.
[00:18:42.063 --> 00:18:44.784]  So Ron Paul is prime position.
[00:18:44.864 --> 00:18:48.446]  Notice he was growing no percent of the vote in the first month.
[00:18:48.466 --> 00:18:49.727]  Three months in, two percent.
[00:18:50.027 --> 00:18:51.368]  Six months in, four percent.
[00:18:51.388 --> 00:18:52.088]  Then ten percent.
[00:18:52.108 --> 00:18:52.829]  Then twelve percent.
[00:18:53.089 --> 00:18:54.209]  Fifteen percent in polls.
[00:18:54.850 --> 00:19:01.373]  Staying in with the message and energizing and the grassroots knowing there's definitely a game plan.
[00:19:02.033 --> 00:19:04.435]  The grassroots doesn't understand
[00:19:05.406 --> 00:19:13.328]  And even those that do understand know it's a super gamble for some type of broker convention so it doesn't capture the imagination.
[00:19:13.948 --> 00:19:29.091]  I'm saying third party is the way to go from every angle and I literally spent hours every night studying and looking at this and yeah third parties don't work in the past but because they didn't have the grassroots machinery.
[00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:32.012]  We have the machinery if we start soon.
[00:19:32.032 --> 00:19:33.352]  Now I know Paul
[00:19:34.096 --> 00:19:35.958]  He wants to stay in, and I'll tell you what's happening.
[00:19:35.978 --> 00:19:37.038]  I think he's going to go for third party.
[00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:46.206]  He wants to stay in through the next couple primaries to keep his name in there, to get more delegates, to then keep building name recognition.
[00:19:47.127 --> 00:19:48.348]  So I'm sure he knows what he's doing.
[00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:49.849]  Anything else you want to add, Pat?
[00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:52.131]  Yeah, I have one comment about Naomi Wolf today.
[00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:53.572]  Could you hold me over?
[00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:54.133]  Yeah, stay there.
[00:19:54.153 --> 00:19:54.933]  I'll come right back to you.
[00:19:54.953 --> 00:19:55.934]  Then we're going to hurry through your calls.
[00:19:56.254 --> 00:19:58.156]  Bill, Robert, Don, Ahmed, many others.
[00:19:58.176 --> 00:19:58.236]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.601]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.222 --> 00:20:14.147]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.607 --> 00:20:21.791]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.518 --> 00:20:28.000]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:39.325]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.086 --> 00:20:42.146]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.647 --> 00:20:44.067]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:50.711 --> 00:20:55.173]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:55.573 --> 00:20:57.114]  A new world order.
[00:20:57.154 --> 00:21:06.857]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:21:07.678 --> 00:21:13.560]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.841]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[00:21:16.381 --> 00:21:18.782]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:26.899]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:34.893]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:38.856]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.216 --> 00:21:41.718]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:41.778 --> 00:21:42.919]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:42.939 --> 00:21:43.699]  They're not after money.
[00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:44.800]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:45.741]  They're after power.
[00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:47.142]  That's what they're after, usually.

[00:21:58.629 --> 00:21:59.690]  You have been warned.
[00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:00.932]  We're good to go.
[00:22:13.234 --> 00:22:13.534]  I don't know.

[00:22:44.143 --> 00:22:45.644]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:23:00.063 --> 00:23:01.745]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:23:02.045 --> 00:23:05.509]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.572]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:23:08.132 --> 00:23:10.895]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:23:11.216 --> 00:23:14.940]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:15.300]  I think so.
[00:23:36.807 --> 00:23:42.670]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:47.412]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.

[00:23:58.576 --> 00:23:59.317]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:01.312 --> 00:24:04.153]  Okay, going back to Pat in Missouri.
[00:24:04.173 --> 00:24:05.554]  Pat, you're on the air.
[00:24:05.594 --> 00:24:06.114]  Go ahead.
[00:24:06.134 --> 00:24:12.297]  I've listened to you talk with Naomi Wolf a few times, and I put this on the Prison Planet Forum.
[00:24:12.377 --> 00:24:13.998]  I've wondered why she leaves out
[00:24:31.027 --> 00:24:38.633]  The last and most important step toward fascism, there's actually 11 steps, and she never mentions the last one, and I would like to know why.
[00:24:38.653 --> 00:24:45.378]  She never talks about the gathering of the people's guns as the last step.
[00:24:47.259 --> 00:24:55.125]  Well, Naomi Wolf is a leftist, and we have her on because she's talking about martial law in a police state because it wakes up liberals.
[00:24:55.563 --> 00:24:57.144]  You know, we have conservatives, liberals on.
[00:24:57.484 --> 00:25:00.166]  I mean, I don't agree with Pat Buchanan on some issues, I have him on.
[00:25:00.626 --> 00:25:03.387]  I don't agree with Naomi Wolf on some issues, I have her on.
[00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:08.210]  But you're right, that's a big part of the step towards the new world order system.
[00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:13.573]  Fascism, command and control, dictatorship, tyranny, whatever name you want to give it.
[00:25:14.014 --> 00:25:18.236]  And we do write articles, we do talk about the gun confiscation and the attempts to get our Second Amendment.
[00:25:18.922 --> 00:25:27.225]  You know, in her video where she gives that talk, it's a big hit on YouTube, and it's quite long, I think 45 minutes or so.
[00:25:27.885 --> 00:25:30.526]  She goes through the whole thing, explaining these 10 steps.
[00:25:31.067 --> 00:25:40.570]  And in that video, she talks about the Fourth Amendment being the right to own firearms.
[00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.991]  I think somebody needs to straighten her out on that.
[00:25:43.971 --> 00:25:45.312]  Listen to it, you'll see what I mean.
[00:25:45.692 --> 00:25:47.173]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[00:25:47.274 --> 00:25:51.216]  Listen, I was talking about RFID 13 years ago.
[00:25:51.236 --> 00:25:54.379]  Tex Mars was talking about it 18 years ago.
[00:25:54.399 --> 00:26:08.890]  There are now people who are the quote experts on RFID, who I remember poo-pooing me 6-7 years ago when they first woke up to it, and they couldn't believe the extremity of the info I was putting out.
[00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.691]  It's the same thing with Naomi Wolf.
[00:26:11.337 --> 00:26:12.998]  I mean, she's prominent.
[00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:14.098]  She's a best-selling author.
[00:26:14.118 --> 00:26:15.139]  She's highly respected.
[00:26:15.579 --> 00:26:16.319]  We have her on.
[00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:17.020]  We school her.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.021]  I send her hundreds of articles.
[00:26:19.061 --> 00:26:21.582]  We've been educating her, talking to her off-air.
[00:26:22.522 --> 00:26:24.563]  And it's going to be a learning process.
[00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:29.165]  But I know a lot of liberals now that are owning firearms and understand how important it is.
[00:26:29.586 --> 00:26:31.146]  We are breaking through that paradigm.
[00:26:31.426 --> 00:26:32.667]  Good to hear from you.
[00:26:32.727 --> 00:26:33.828]  Bill in Wisconsin.
[00:26:33.868 --> 00:26:34.468]  Bill, you're on the air.
[00:26:34.508 --> 00:26:35.028]  Thanks for holding.
[00:26:36.109 --> 00:26:36.709]  Hey, Alex.
[00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:38.150]  Good to talk with you.
[00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:38.930]  Good to talk to you.
[00:26:39.554 --> 00:26:45.838]  You know, years ago I started listening to you, and I'm an old curmudgeon.
[00:26:45.878 --> 00:26:56.384]  I've been around a lot of these political campaigns for a long time, and you got me active, okay, even though I had health problems at the time.
[00:26:57.024 --> 00:27:01.546]  I got elected town board chairman, county board supervisor.
[00:27:02.247 --> 00:27:06.589]  I whooped the town board chairman the first time by a hundred votes.
[00:27:06.629 --> 00:27:07.630]  He ran against me.
[00:27:08.337 --> 00:27:10.358]  Again, the last time I beat him 3 to 1.
[00:27:11.118 --> 00:27:18.602]  Property rights issues, you know, freedom, a lot of the things that you've encouraged us to do.
[00:27:18.782 --> 00:27:26.045]  And let me just add, good people have to run to get in local office now to stop the fraudulent machines from coming in.
[00:27:26.305 --> 00:27:28.366]  They're only in about 40% of the nation.
[00:27:28.426 --> 00:27:29.526]  It's grown from 35 to 40.
[00:27:29.666 --> 00:27:31.447]  It looks like more like 42% now.
[00:27:31.487 --> 00:27:33.248]  I've been trying to break down the numbers.
[00:27:33.288 --> 00:27:33.908]  They're sketchy.
[00:27:34.308 --> 00:27:37.350]  You've got to rush to get in position to block them now.
[00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.750]  Go ahead.
[00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:47.354]  We've got three candidates for the spring election besides myself that are running Ron Paul people for the county board.
[00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:51.936]  And I'm even tinkering with the idea of running for Congress.
[00:27:52.643 --> 00:27:54.964]  As an independent this time around.
[00:27:55.024 --> 00:27:57.105]  And that's what Larry Nichols was saying, and it's true.
[00:27:57.585 --> 00:28:04.688]  Every major Ron Paul supporter who's got the time, the energy, not even much money, run for office.
[00:28:04.989 --> 00:28:07.250]  And again, you don't even have to do much.
[00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.590]  A lot of you will get in.
[00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.732]  There are many incumbents running unopposed.
[00:28:12.852 --> 00:28:20.576]  And if you just get on the ballot in your area, even if it's on the water board, anything, telecommunications, anything, get in there.
[00:28:21.934 --> 00:28:23.475]  It's not hard to get elected.
[00:28:24.435 --> 00:28:31.438]  You've got to go around, you've got to beat on doors, you've got to get letters to the editor and the paper, but it can be done.
[00:28:31.878 --> 00:28:33.218]  And frankly, this is a war.
[00:28:33.339 --> 00:28:38.941]  I think a lot of you should be honest about being liberty lovers, but in some areas,
[00:28:40.384 --> 00:28:40.684]  Absolutely.
[00:28:40.724 --> 00:28:44.866]  If you remember, Alex, and I don't know, go back in your memory, you had Pat Buchanan a while back, years ago.
[00:29:09.284 --> 00:29:09.784]  We're good to go.
[00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:27.392]  And then you had him on, and he had walked away from that party.
[00:29:27.452 --> 00:29:28.653]  Remember that interview?
[00:29:29.013 --> 00:29:29.453]  That's right.
[00:29:29.493 --> 00:29:33.976]  He walked away, and I'm not attacking Pat, but he walked away, Senator Ross Perot.
[00:29:34.216 --> 00:29:36.898]  Ross Perot, when he walked away, had about 34% of the vote.
[00:29:37.238 --> 00:29:38.538]  He didn't even have the infrastructure.
[00:29:38.558 --> 00:29:39.279]  He only had the money.
[00:29:39.539 --> 00:29:40.500]  Ron Paul has money.
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.520]  He has infrastructure.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.020]  Stay there.
[00:29:42.441 --> 00:29:43.341]  Let you finish up, Bill.
[00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:44.042]  Love hearing from you.
[00:29:44.342 --> 00:29:46.043]  Robert, Don, and many others continuing.
[00:29:46.303 --> 00:29:47.764]  What do you think Ron Paul should do?
[00:29:48.124 --> 00:29:50.025]  Stay in the Republican Party or run third party?
[00:29:51.784 --> 00:29:54.793]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.716 --> 00:29:58.404]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.676 --> 00:30:04.598]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:09.943]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:30:10.303 --> 00:30:15.607]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:16.008 --> 00:30:17.149]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:17.489 --> 00:30:26.356]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:30:26.796 --> 00:30:28.398]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:30:28.638 --> 00:30:32.823]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:31:02.466 --> 00:31:05.008]  These are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:31:05.028 --> 00:31:07.911]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:31:25.148 --> 00:31:26.930]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.152]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:31:29.192 --> 00:31:33.556]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:31:33.716 --> 00:31:35.858]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:31:35.938 --> 00:31:43.706]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:31:43.746 --> 00:31:44.266]  We're good.
[00:32:01.341 --> 00:32:02.002]  It's a fact.
[00:32:02.202 --> 00:32:09.691]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:32:09.811 --> 00:32:16.118]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all
[00:32:16.118 --> 00:32:16.838]  We're good to go.
[00:32:36.027 --> 00:32:41.052]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:32:41.232 --> 00:32:45.716]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:32:45.877 --> 00:32:47.678]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:32:47.738 --> 00:32:47.919]  That's 877-943-8600.

[00:32:48.319 --> 00:32:49.640]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.341]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:33:03.966 --> 00:33:21.273]  The creature man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive The interest is up and the stock market's down And you only get mugged if you go downtown
[00:33:26.899 --> 00:33:48.375]  I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and me I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive And a country boy can survive Country folks can survive
[00:33:52.384 --> 00:33:55.105]  I can plow a field all day long.
[00:33:55.205 --> 00:33:59.587]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn.
[00:34:00.767 --> 00:34:06.410]  We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:09.371]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[00:34:14.208 --> 00:34:19.955]  We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine and country boy can survive.
[00:34:20.415 --> 00:34:25.581]  Country folks can survive.
[00:34:26.382 --> 00:34:31.748]  Because you can't starve about and you can't make a run.
[00:34:40.177 --> 00:34:41.899]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:41.939 --> 00:34:44.361]  Let's go straight back to your calls and hurry as much as we can.
[00:34:44.401 --> 00:34:46.323]  We're going to have open phones throughout the three hours.
[00:34:47.584 --> 00:34:54.670]  Larry Becraft's going to be on the third hour with us, going into Patriot scams, frauds, different groups that promise things that are lies.
[00:34:55.311 --> 00:34:57.593]  This will be very, very informative and educational.
[00:34:57.633 --> 00:34:59.655]  Butch Paw's going to be riding shotgun the pastor.
[00:35:01.198 --> 00:35:07.520]  You know, I called the Ron Paul campaign right after Super Tuesday, and I laid out pretty much the scenario that you're talking about.
[00:35:30.734 --> 00:35:32.035]  They haven't been covering him.
[00:35:32.215 --> 00:35:34.878]  Now, we did get some name recognition.
[00:35:35.338 --> 00:35:41.384]  He did get in some of the debates where he did, and got his viewpoints across.
[00:35:41.424 --> 00:35:42.465]  He did well.
[00:35:43.025 --> 00:35:44.647]  But let's face facts.
[00:35:44.807 --> 00:35:48.710]  They are not going to give him the nomination no matter what happens.
[00:35:49.391 --> 00:35:50.432]  No matter what happens.
[00:35:50.992 --> 00:35:56.057]  So therefore, I think, like you say, we've got a time frame here where
[00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:58.452]  I think he ought to go independent.
[00:35:58.672 --> 00:36:09.561]  The merging of these other parties brings in all of their baggage where they fight over little issues and over all of that kind of business.
[00:36:09.602 --> 00:36:12.584]  So I think independent is the best way to go.
[00:36:13.165 --> 00:36:15.467]  Then he's got to ratchet it up some.
[00:36:16.087 --> 00:36:16.488]  Okay?
[00:36:16.828 --> 00:36:21.332]  He doesn't have to say, I agree that the towers were imploded.
[00:36:22.052 --> 00:36:23.314]  All he has to say is,
[00:36:24.341 --> 00:36:27.022]  I think we need to investigate this.
[00:36:27.582 --> 00:36:32.963]  It demands that we... By the way, even Walter Mondale has said that now, and said that we were lied to.
[00:36:33.923 --> 00:36:34.784]  Right, right.
[00:36:35.844 --> 00:36:43.346]  You know, we had this guy that was on the airplane with the TB, and Congress had an immediate investigation.
[00:36:43.846 --> 00:36:53.748]  Now, if they can investigate something like that, which, you know, may have had potential of different things, but if they can investigate that, they can certainly
[00:36:54.324 --> 00:36:56.425]  Investigate 9-11.
[00:36:56.746 --> 00:36:58.867]  So that's the way you ought to go on that.
[00:36:59.207 --> 00:37:10.054]  And that would at least open that door for us then to pound on the issue and to bring it out into the open even more than we've been trying to do.
[00:37:10.254 --> 00:37:10.855]  I agree with you.
[00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:11.935]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:37:11.975 --> 00:37:15.818]  And I remember many years ago when you called and said you were going to run for office and you won.
[00:37:15.838 --> 00:37:22.502]  That's basically the equivalent of a county commissioner here in Texas up in your state of Wisconsin.
[00:37:23.832 --> 00:37:24.553]  That's how you do it.
[00:37:25.933 --> 00:37:34.919]  Look, on the subject of Ron Paul, Ronald Reagan handily won the delegates in 1980.
[00:37:35.279 --> 00:37:39.542]  And I have talked to people, high-level Republicans, multiple Republicans that were there.
[00:37:40.002 --> 00:37:42.423]  This happened all in a big meeting room with a couple hundred people.
[00:37:44.104 --> 00:37:45.965]  He hated George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:37:45.985 --> 00:37:50.348]  He'd given speeches about how he was trilateral commission, CFR, New World Order.
[00:37:50.388 --> 00:37:51.709]  Yeah, Reagan used to talk like that.
[00:37:53.607 --> 00:37:58.369]  And they told him, if you don't put him on as your VP, we are not going to give you the nomination.
[00:37:58.409 --> 00:38:03.030]  We're going to go out there and bring out a bunch of scandals, and we're going to give it to somebody else.
[00:38:04.971 --> 00:38:05.811]  And Reagan did that.
[00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:09.512]  And then, of course, we know the Bush crime family had him shot a year later.
[00:38:09.933 --> 00:38:14.474]  They drugged him up from that point on, basically, except when they would get him off the drugs and roll him out for a speech.
[00:38:16.815 --> 00:38:18.756]  And if you don't know that, it's mainline history.
[00:38:18.816 --> 00:38:20.396]  You can research all of it.
[00:38:21.697 --> 00:38:22.577]  It's all available.
[00:38:24.617 --> 00:38:34.321]  Now, if Ronald Reagan, who won the majority of the delegates, was being told by the machine ring, you're not going to get it if you don't do this, Ron Paul, with a fraction of the delegates, is going to go in?
[00:38:35.421 --> 00:38:44.805]  Now, with Romney dropping out and all the rest of this happening, you could argue that it would help Ron Paul, but you can also argue that it hurts him.
[00:38:47.346 --> 00:38:50.107]  And you've got Huckabee, who's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,
[00:38:52.614 --> 00:38:54.295]  Who they've endorsed and who they just love.
[00:38:54.315 --> 00:38:56.376]  He's another globalist, but he fools conservatives.
[00:38:56.936 --> 00:38:58.236]  Who knows what's going to happen?
[00:38:59.137 --> 00:39:02.118]  I just know that the Republicans are not going to nominate Ron Paul.
[00:39:02.618 --> 00:39:12.183]  They have been involved in every form of cheating and lying and he would win a state and they'd say he got second place or he'd get second place and they'd say that he, they wouldn't even show him in the lineup.
[00:39:13.263 --> 00:39:15.124]  That's the type of stuff they've been doing.
[00:39:16.825 --> 00:39:17.485]  Dirty pool!
[00:39:19.173 --> 00:39:28.282]  And I know we win in the Info War if he runs third party, because then, if we go out to the nomination, and then Ron Paul doesn't win it, then he won't be in the further debates.
[00:39:28.483 --> 00:39:31.386]  We won't hear about anti-war issues anymore.
[00:39:32.747 --> 00:39:33.848]  Or North American Union.
[00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.392]  So it's more of a sure thing.
[00:39:37.472 --> 00:39:40.395]  It's a better shot to do third party
[00:39:41.889 --> 00:39:50.633]  Then, frankly, the pipe dream, I mean, we should keep campaigning if he stays in, keep giving money, you know, at least he's still staying in, and I think that's what they're doing.
[00:39:50.673 --> 00:40:04.018]  I think they're waiting to go through a few more of the primary states, try to pick up some more delegates, so he can be in the debates, and so now it's narrowed down to three, so he can be seen on the news.
[00:40:05.233 --> 00:40:11.557]  Uh, but you notice as it's narrowed, the media, back when it was ten, nine, eight people, they gave him a little bit of attention.
[00:40:11.877 --> 00:40:14.058]  Have you noticed how he doesn't get any attention now?
[00:40:14.958 --> 00:40:16.079]  That it's narrowed down to three?
[00:40:16.879 --> 00:40:20.241]  And he'll get a third of the questions a third of the time?
[00:40:22.763 --> 00:40:23.463]  Have you seen that?
[00:40:24.614 --> 00:40:26.495]  So, they're still minimizing him.
[00:40:26.815 --> 00:40:28.916]  The campaign thinks they're going to become more prominent.
[00:40:29.156 --> 00:40:31.878]  They think when they get in there on the ballot, it'll look better with only three names.
[00:40:32.158 --> 00:40:33.418]  And that probably is the case.
[00:40:33.438 --> 00:40:36.520]  I think you're going to see him in states where he's getting 5%, get 10%.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.562]  I think in states where you see him getting 10%, he's going to get 20%.
[00:40:41.342 --> 00:40:45.204]  And states like Minnesota, where he got, what, 14, 15%?
[00:40:45.264 --> 00:40:46.745]  I think you're going to see him get 30, 40%.
[00:40:47.405 --> 00:40:48.706]  I think Ron Paul could win Washington State.
[00:40:54.565 --> 00:40:58.427]  But he already won Louisiana, and they just didn't cover it.
[00:40:59.208 --> 00:41:07.092]  Now, granted, that's a bigger state and has more news affiliates in it and more technology, so you'll hear about it, about, oh yeah, he got one state.
[00:41:09.173 --> 00:41:14.116]  But Obama won almost twice as many states as Hillary, but did you see who they gave the attention to?
[00:41:14.176 --> 00:41:14.516]  Hillary!
[00:41:14.536 --> 00:41:15.897]  Because she's the anointed one.
[00:41:17.557 --> 00:41:18.958]  So, we have to weigh this.
[00:41:18.998 --> 00:41:19.659]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:41:19.679 --> 00:41:20.839]  Okay, now I'm really going to move fast.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.080]  These calls are all so good.
[00:41:25.245 --> 00:41:26.025]  Texas, you're on the air.
[00:41:26.045 --> 00:41:26.366]  Go ahead.
[00:41:27.006 --> 00:41:28.146]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:41:28.286 --> 00:41:29.007]  Thanks for calling, sir.
[00:41:29.027 --> 00:41:29.627]  You've got the floor.
[00:41:29.927 --> 00:41:30.267]  All right.
[00:41:30.307 --> 00:41:42.072]  As a supporting contributor to Ron Paul campaign, I feel that Ron Paul needs to start engaging McCain and Huckleberry and exposing the secrets in how they're pro-legal immigration, pro-Hundred Year War, basically pro-New World Order.
[00:41:42.773 --> 00:41:45.594]  And otherwise, I think he'll continue to be ignored by the mainstream media.
[00:41:48.044 --> 00:41:50.845]  He has been engaging them some, but he's too gentlemanly.
[00:41:51.245 --> 00:41:55.687]  He needs to be vicious and incendiary to force it out into the media.
[00:41:56.107 --> 00:41:59.009]  He needs to be pulling publicity stunt after publicity stunt.
[00:41:59.909 --> 00:42:07.812]  I really do think he needs to start engaging them in the debate, as well as through his media.
[00:42:08.172 --> 00:42:11.654]  And I don't know if he goes third party, are they really going to allow him in the debate?
[00:42:14.864 --> 00:42:18.025]  They will have to if he's getting more than 10% in polls, and he will be.
[00:42:18.645 --> 00:42:18.925]  Yeah.
[00:42:19.665 --> 00:42:20.585]  Okay, I hope so.
[00:42:22.146 --> 00:42:23.226]  Alright, thank you so much, Alex.
[00:42:23.246 --> 00:42:24.286]  Well, let me ask you then.
[00:42:24.466 --> 00:42:26.247]  I mean, what do you think we should do?
[00:42:27.307 --> 00:42:30.488]  Uh, like I said, I just really think he needs to start engaging them.
[00:42:30.508 --> 00:42:33.068]  He needs to expose them for what they really are.
[00:42:33.608 --> 00:42:35.549]  And I think that will garner a lot of attention.
[00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:37.709]  People will start opening their eyes when he starts to do that.
[00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:39.890]  I agree with you, sir.
[00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:41.390]  And by the way, this is not a cult.
[00:42:42.555 --> 00:42:55.261]  Some people have emailed me, the minority of folks, saying, don't question the Paul campaign, do whatever they say, don't on your own political talk show, say what strategy you have.
[00:42:55.361 --> 00:42:56.582]  Hey, I'm not in a cult.
[00:42:57.442 --> 00:42:59.223]  And the Ron Paul campaign's not running a cult.
[00:42:59.303 --> 00:43:01.884]  I'll say whatever I want, I'll talk about whatever I want.
[00:43:02.645 --> 00:43:05.066]  And I will question, and I will bring forward my points.
[00:43:05.826 --> 00:43:08.667]  And, by the way, you are welcome to call in at 1-800-259-9231 with your points as well.
[00:43:12.944 --> 00:43:18.587]  Ron Paul, a few times, has really gotten angry, really gotten focused, really cut into people.
[00:43:19.107 --> 00:43:24.950]  When they've attacked him and people are laughing at him, you know, he'll come back with, no, I take my orders from the Constitution, not Bin Laden.
[00:43:25.331 --> 00:43:26.651]  He'll come back with those stingers.
[00:43:28.292 --> 00:43:37.057]  He is so genuine, though, that he doesn't come into those fights with any, you know, pre-prepared catchphrases.
[00:43:38.858 --> 00:43:40.559]  He needs to get vicious.
[00:43:42.839 --> 00:43:43.139]  Hello, Alex.
[00:44:11.977 --> 00:44:12.877]  First time caller.
[00:44:13.037 --> 00:44:13.377]  Welcome.
[00:44:14.798 --> 00:44:18.779]  I got a whole laundry list of things that I think that Ron Paul should do.
[00:44:19.379 --> 00:44:27.842]  First is, between now and the Republican convention, I think he needs to pursue the vote fraud issue because I think voters prefer an underdog.
[00:44:28.882 --> 00:44:41.706]  Additionally, when Hillary and Barack Obama show up in Texas, I want him to try to put himself in a position to ask Hillary who planned the first and the last day of the Branch Davidian siege
[00:44:42.142 --> 00:44:43.623]  Because she obviously did.
[00:44:43.643 --> 00:44:49.428]  I wanted to ask Barack Obama about his involvement in the Kenya Civil War.
[00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:57.835]  Also, if he can go through the Republican Convention, I think that would be great because that would give him more exposure.
[00:44:59.776 --> 00:45:05.541]  He should also go with a third party, and if a third party is not available with him, ask for write-ins.
[00:45:07.302 --> 00:45:10.105]  And there's a fourth fallback if he doesn't win the election.
[00:45:10.845 --> 00:45:11.646]  You want to hear that one?
[00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.871]  I want to hear it all!
[00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:13.831]  All right.
[00:45:15.132 --> 00:45:20.616]  Texas needs to refuse to re-ratify the biannual statehood treaty.
[00:45:21.616 --> 00:45:26.858]  And have Ron Paul become President of Texas and any other states that want out of the North American Union?
[00:45:26.958 --> 00:45:27.458]  That's right.
[00:45:27.618 --> 00:45:34.561]  Under the Tenth Amendment, all states are authorized and not even authorized, it is their God-given right to pull out.
[00:45:35.041 --> 00:45:42.344]  But only New Hampshire and Texas, and Texas especially, have it clearly stated that they are autonomous continually to this day.
[00:45:44.918 --> 00:45:45.658]  Absolutely.
[00:45:45.778 --> 00:46:01.924]  I mean, if stuff continues to get more and more serious, we need to have a movement that's not a bunch of guys in camo, all fighting over who the President is, but like the Founding Fathers, in an orderly fashion, to educate the public with a happy, you know, Ron Paul type face, to have the Republic of Texas.
[00:46:03.505 --> 00:46:04.185]  Sounds good to me.
[00:46:05.151 --> 00:46:05.872]  It certainly does.
[00:46:05.892 --> 00:46:11.255]  I mean, if they're going to have the North American Union, we might as well have our own little enclave and get out of this thing, because... You bet.
[00:46:11.695 --> 00:46:12.596]  I don't want to be in that.
[00:46:12.996 --> 00:46:13.956]  John, good to hear from you.
[00:46:13.976 --> 00:46:14.597]  Really good points.
[00:46:14.657 --> 00:46:15.097]  Anything else?
[00:46:17.178 --> 00:46:20.600]  Okay, let's talk to John in Colorado.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.241]  You're on the air.
[00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:21.941]  Go ahead, John.
[00:46:22.221 --> 00:46:22.782]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:46:23.742 --> 00:46:28.045]  First, well, I'm going to talk about Ron Paul, but really quick, I just want to thank you.
[00:46:28.065 --> 00:46:29.746]  I mean, thank you, thank you.
[00:46:30.506 --> 00:46:32.428]  And you and your staff are endgame.
[00:46:33.408 --> 00:46:34.749]  That is an extremely
[00:46:35.328 --> 00:46:37.230]  Very, very important.
[00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:39.412]  You were in the Club of Rome?
[00:46:57.333 --> 00:46:58.254]  Well, you know what?
[00:46:58.334 --> 00:46:59.455]  Send me some evidence.
[00:46:59.655 --> 00:47:00.636]  Did you get any photos?
[00:47:00.697 --> 00:47:01.397]  Any handouts?
[00:47:01.577 --> 00:47:02.298]  Well, no.
[00:47:02.358 --> 00:47:02.999]  This is in 1988.
[00:47:03.279 --> 00:47:05.682]  I didn't even know really what it was I was going to.
[00:47:05.702 --> 00:47:10.526]  I was just told to go to this and you would see the devil himself, basically.
[00:47:10.847 --> 00:47:12.028]  Where were you working at the time?
[00:47:12.629 --> 00:47:13.149]  Bahrain.
[00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:15.331]  But, I mean, in what industry?
[00:47:15.371 --> 00:47:16.352]  I'm just interested.
[00:47:16.552 --> 00:47:16.973]  Military.
[00:47:18.238 --> 00:47:19.899]  Well, you know what, you've got the floor.
[00:47:20.059 --> 00:47:28.441]  I mean, I already have their documents and their plan to bring in world government and exterminate 80% of us as public, but I'll give you more time if you need.
[00:47:28.761 --> 00:47:36.043]  Tell me, in 88, when you were in the military in Bahrain, you went to the Club of Rome meeting, a subsidiary of the Bilderberg Group, and what did they say?
[00:47:37.003 --> 00:47:38.984]  Well, they were talking about Global Report 2000.
[00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:47.046]  Everything, that was one of the things that kicked it off, but everything that you see
[00:47:48.488 --> 00:47:53.510]  Whether it's global warming, whether it's 9-11, Oklahoma City is strategy of tension.
[00:47:53.710 --> 00:48:00.032]  They talked about strategy of tension and that was about, I'd say, an hour and a half of the three-hour meeting.
[00:48:01.192 --> 00:48:03.633]  A lot was discussed on eugenics.
[00:48:03.933 --> 00:48:12.916]  A lot was discussed primarily using the African model to basically, you know, once they figure out how to
[00:48:14.252 --> 00:48:16.053]  White people out there.
[00:48:16.373 --> 00:48:17.454]  Were you an intelligence?
[00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:21.177]  Because really only somebody in intelligence or a liaison.
[00:48:21.197 --> 00:48:27.861]  Somebody in intelligence gave me the tip and I went into the, it was just at the hotel.
[00:48:28.522 --> 00:48:31.944]  Wasn't in a room, a smoke-filled room, you know, or nothing like that.
[00:48:32.044 --> 00:48:33.465]  Oh no, they publish this stuff, yeah.
[00:48:33.825 --> 00:48:40.810]  Yeah, you know, and that's what is just mind-boggling to me, is that, you know, this is in the open, Bilderberg's closed meeting, but this is in the open.
[00:48:41.263 --> 00:48:43.344]  And they don't have any problem at all talking about that.
[00:48:43.545 --> 00:48:45.626]  And that's what really blows my mind.
[00:48:46.767 --> 00:48:52.110]  But, like I said... Well, the reason I said intelligence, I was thinking that the military had sent you to attend this.
[00:48:52.551 --> 00:48:54.132]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:48:54.972 --> 00:49:01.717]  Like I said, I thought when I went to this thing, when I was looking around, I thought this was just going to be something that was boring.
[00:49:01.737 --> 00:49:04.279]  It was like a meeting on copy machines or something.
[00:49:05.099 --> 00:49:10.323]  And I was just in shorts and a collared shirt, and everybody was in a suit.
[00:49:10.851 --> 00:49:12.352]  Nobody paid attention to me at all.
[00:49:12.792 --> 00:49:14.073]  I mean, they could care less.
[00:49:14.293 --> 00:49:14.753]  Break it down.
[00:49:14.793 --> 00:49:18.756]  They were openly talking about how their operations had done nicely in Africa?
[00:49:18.776 --> 00:49:19.336]  What were they saying?
[00:49:19.776 --> 00:49:20.937]  Well, that's what they were doing.
[00:49:20.977 --> 00:49:28.521]  They were talking about how they were going to use food, medicine, to basically kill people.
[00:49:29.242 --> 00:49:34.325]  And, you know, a doctor would think that he's trying to help somebody.
[00:49:34.345 --> 00:49:35.365]  I'm trying to break this down.
[00:49:35.445 --> 00:49:38.167]  It was, you know, a lot more intricate than that.
[00:49:39.062 --> 00:49:46.425]  But, you know, they would build a system where, uh, you know, while they were helping people, they were actually killing people at the same time.
[00:49:47.726 --> 00:49:49.547]  And, uh... Yeah, it's compartmentalized.
[00:49:49.607 --> 00:49:56.370]  The doctor in the clinic, say, in Libya, as they were caught, didn't know that the vaccines they'd been given had live AIDS virus in it.
[00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:57.471]  Yes.
[00:49:57.611 --> 00:50:05.554]  Well, and now with nanotechnology, uh, it's just scary to think that, uh, what they can do now.
[00:50:06.015 --> 00:50:08.796]  So I just, if I could say anything to anybody out there,
[00:50:09.318 --> 00:50:11.761]  Do not give your DNA, no matter what.
[00:50:12.101 --> 00:50:13.523]  Be nice to the police officer.
[00:50:14.083 --> 00:50:15.225]  Go to jail if you have to.
[00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:16.967]  Do not give your DNA.
[00:50:16.987 --> 00:50:21.572]  Because they have plants now that can tailor bioweapons just for you.
[00:50:22.072 --> 00:50:28.980]  Yes, and not only that, they have the databases now that they can put all this information in.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.722]  And they can actually design a weapon.
[00:50:31.186 --> 00:50:33.988]  ...specifically for you, and that was discussed back in 1988.
[00:50:34.068 --> 00:50:35.388]  Stay there, I want to hear more about this.
[00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:37.189]  And that's all declassified now.
[00:50:37.229 --> 00:50:48.276]  Dick Cheney said they want to legitimize, in the media, using the media, the use... the use of race-specific bio-weapons.
[00:50:50.837 --> 00:50:53.839]  Now, is the football game as important now that you know that?

[00:52:21.927 --> 00:52:29.432]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:52:29.672 --> 00:52:33.215]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.

[00:54:20.113 --> 00:54:25.975]  I'm too psychically exhausted to cover it all, okay?
[00:54:27.135 --> 00:54:33.357]  I can't summon the will most of the time to discuss how wicked the New World Order is.

[00:54:44.056 --> 00:54:47.638]  Major university scientific clinical trials all over the world.
[00:54:49.379 --> 00:54:55.142]  You got that sucker in your pocket and even when it's off, it's receiving and transmitting, it cooks your DNA.
[00:54:57.203 --> 00:55:00.565]  After just a few minutes up against your head, it heats the brain more than one degree.
[00:55:01.666 --> 00:55:03.007]  I know none of us are going to stop.
[00:55:03.547 --> 00:55:06.629]  They know how to get us to habitualize the things that kill us.
[00:55:14.029 --> 00:55:23.294]  You know, you ought to, because you are a witness to this, and we have their documents, it's always good to have somebody who was actually there, tell your story and then put a few links on the web to Club of Rome publications.
[00:55:23.695 --> 00:55:26.316]  They said in the 60s they were going to have a global warming tax.
[00:55:26.376 --> 00:55:28.077]  It was all about a tax, not about warming.
[00:55:29.042 --> 00:55:33.665]  And they talk about how they were going to cull the Earth's population and eugenics and the rest of it, but you were there.
[00:55:33.725 --> 00:55:35.166]  People just like to hear it.
[00:55:35.226 --> 00:55:38.468]  It's how we operate as mammals from someone who witnessed it.
[00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:46.273]  So you want to write like a four or five paragraph blurble up and send it to Curt Nemo, send it to InfoWars or Prison Planet.
[00:55:47.153 --> 00:55:54.738]  Yeah, I have my podcast and I called it Alex Jones Analysis, the Alex Jones Analysis.
[00:55:55.276 --> 00:56:01.821]  And I'm doing the Club of Rome right now, and I'm going to keep going over it so I can rehash everything and get into better details.
[00:56:01.981 --> 00:56:03.603]  Yeah, but it's also good to have it in written word.
[00:56:04.003 --> 00:56:04.243]  True.
[00:56:04.884 --> 00:56:05.144]  True.
[00:56:06.365 --> 00:56:07.986]  But, like you say, don't believe me.
[00:56:08.146 --> 00:56:08.967]  I mean, don't.
[00:56:09.708 --> 00:56:11.709]  Please go out and check these documents out.
[00:56:11.769 --> 00:56:12.790]  Please get Endgame.
[00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:15.572]  Please verify this for yourself.
[00:56:15.652 --> 00:56:16.713]  No, it's not true.
[00:56:16.753 --> 00:56:20.776]  I'm going to drink fluoride and use the cell phone and take Prozac and trust the government.
[00:56:20.957 --> 00:56:22.238]  Listen, I appreciate you calling, my friend.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:37.428]  You know, it shakes me every day, and not even in a fearful way, it's like a high wind just blows you over, that my goodness, psychopathic genius killers run the scientific infrastructure.
[00:56:37.968 --> 00:56:39.869]  They're waging all-out war on us.
[00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:45.333]  We've only discovered the weapons programs they launched on us in the 30s, 40s, and 50s.
[00:56:45.973 --> 00:56:48.495]  Heaven knows what's going on now.
[00:56:50.643 --> 00:56:59.786]  So, see, if you're a Mexican La Rica conquista that was taught to hate America and wave Mexican flags and, you know, you had your land stolen, does any of that even matter when the new order is trying to kill you?
[00:57:00.526 --> 00:57:15.811]  Or you're a cop, say, in Williamson County who's been brainwashed and sold on, you know, being a legend nationwide for putting people in prison and throwing the book at people for overdue library books or videos they didn't return to the video store?
[00:57:17.032 --> 00:57:18.472]  I mean, you're under chemical attack.
[00:57:19.395 --> 00:57:21.677]  So, you can think you're in control all day long.
[00:57:21.697 --> 00:57:22.057]  You're not.
[00:57:23.178 --> 00:57:24.119]  I wish you'd wake up.
[00:57:24.219 --> 00:57:25.440]  I hate what's happening to you.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.902]  I hate what's happening to all of us.
[00:57:28.003 --> 00:57:29.123]  We're all in this together.
[00:57:30.425 --> 00:57:33.787]  And I have all these news clips that are calling us civilians I wanted to play today.
[00:57:34.628 --> 00:57:39.813]  And all these news clips that are taking DNA from people forcibly and just randomly at checkpoints.
[00:57:39.913 --> 00:57:41.714]  I mean, it's just all off the chart.
[00:57:42.515 --> 00:57:44.317]  And I forgot I had these two guests on today.
[00:57:44.337 --> 00:57:45.778]  I wanted to play the Ron Paul speech.
[00:57:47.074 --> 00:57:47.574]  Maybe I'll do that.
[00:57:47.594 --> 00:57:50.596]  Maybe we'll just have Butch on for 20-30 minutes, but I wanted to have him on longer.
[00:57:51.297 --> 00:57:53.718]  I want to take your calls about what the Ron Paul campaign should do.
[00:57:53.738 --> 00:57:56.000]  Let's jam another one in here.
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:59.182]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in LA.
[00:57:59.222 --> 00:57:59.702]  Go ahead, John.
[00:58:01.623 --> 00:58:01.743]  Alex?
[00:58:02.204 --> 00:58:03.384]  Yes, beloved of God.
[00:58:03.404 --> 00:58:04.645]  How are you?
[00:58:05.586 --> 00:58:06.546]  Folks, I'm not going crazy.
[00:58:06.566 --> 00:58:07.387]  That's what John means.
[00:58:07.787 --> 00:58:08.147]  Good, man.
[00:58:08.167 --> 00:58:08.708]  What's on your mind?
[00:58:09.808 --> 00:58:11.910]  Um, well, first of all,
[00:58:13.433 --> 00:58:18.576]  I think Ron Paul should run as an independent just because of the word independent is out there, you know?
[00:58:18.596 --> 00:58:26.460]  Like with Lou Dobbs saying, like, uh, you know, an independent candidate and everybody's hyped on the word independent.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.040]  Don't you agree?
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.901]  Yeah, everybody's primed.
[00:58:28.921 --> 00:58:31.962]  Uh, I see this AP report that Congress has a 20% approval rating.
[00:58:32.503 --> 00:58:34.223]  I've got Gallup six months ago at 11%.
[00:58:35.784 --> 00:58:38.446]  Most Americans call themselves independent or libertarian now.
[00:58:38.706 --> 00:58:39.026]  Stay there.
[00:58:42.884 --> 00:58:46.266]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.286 --> 00:58:58.011]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.211 --> 00:58:58.891]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.511 --> 00:59:00.592]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.292 --> 00:59:02.393]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.033 --> 00:59:03.873]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.614 --> 00:59:05.394]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.178 --> 00:59:09.821]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:16.846]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.127 --> 00:59:21.889]  An amazing story with Butch Paw and Jeff Becker is coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:21.909 --> 00:59:22.850]  We'll get into the preachers.
[00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:32.537]  Also, out there, 26,000 plus, we told you this two and a half years ago, now it's mainstream news, being trained to teach their flock to hand in their guns, submit to world government.
[00:59:33.414 --> 00:59:35.035]  Your phone calls were continuing with them.
[00:59:35.055 --> 00:59:36.036]  What should Ron Paul do?
[00:59:36.076 --> 00:59:38.258]  Run independent or stay in the race?
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:43.102]  Let's go ahead and go back to John in L.A.
[00:59:43.162 --> 00:59:43.702]  Go ahead, John.
[00:59:45.263 --> 00:59:47.525]  Well, I'm listening to Rush Limbaugh this morning.
[00:59:48.326 --> 00:59:53.370]  And, you know, basically he's just saying vote for Hillary now.
[00:59:55.131 --> 01:00:02.897]  And he's reading letters on air of all these, you know, Republicans who are angry with him because
[01:00:03.755 --> 01:00:06.596]  You know, he basically said, vote for Hillary, don't support McCain.
[01:00:06.716 --> 01:00:08.477]  How long have you been listening to the show?
[01:00:09.678 --> 01:00:11.959]  No, you said that four years ago.
[01:00:12.879 --> 01:00:25.005]  In fact, I don't have the staff to do it, but we're thinking about getting interns, but then they become more... You said that back when Bush was running with Kerry, because they were...
[01:00:57.464 --> 01:00:58.590]  You know, magically, um...
[01:01:26.212 --> 01:01:28.815]  We're good to go.
[01:01:55.817 --> 01:01:59.739]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure our friends, as soon as I start talking again, will cut us off.
[01:02:00.099 --> 01:02:01.399]  Probably just a complete accident.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:08.042]  Every time I bring up absolutely key issues, the ISDN line cuts out now, even though I have a backup here on two separate companies.
[01:02:08.262 --> 01:02:10.043]  But digressing, I can't do it.
[01:02:10.063 --> 01:02:10.864]  I don't have the staff.
[01:02:10.904 --> 01:02:11.904]  I don't have the interns.
[01:02:13.645 --> 01:02:15.025]  I need the YouTube folks.
[01:02:15.766 --> 01:02:16.586]  I need the listeners.
[01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:23.529]  I've probably said in the last five, six years, since I learned that Roger Ailes was advising Hillary,
[01:02:24.258 --> 01:02:28.720]  That you will hear Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, and others endorse Hillary Clinton.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.261]  Now, I told you this.
[01:02:31.321 --> 01:02:32.321]  She's CIA.
[01:02:32.721 --> 01:02:35.703]  She was recruited with Clinton by Kordmeier in 1968.
[01:02:36.343 --> 01:02:37.283]  We have the documents.
[01:02:38.444 --> 01:02:39.884]  And we need to do some stories on that.
[01:02:39.904 --> 01:02:41.625]  I need to have Jim Mars on covering that.
[01:02:41.765 --> 01:02:45.747]  But that's even in other mainstream Republican websites are now reporting that.
[01:02:47.787 --> 01:02:49.308]  And this is staged.
[01:02:50.376 --> 01:02:57.720]  And I told you, you will be called a liberal, you will be called an enemy of America if you're against gun control, open borders, and Hillary Clinton.
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:02.142]  Fox News, the guy that runs Fox News, is the mentor of Limbaugh.
[01:03:02.703 --> 01:03:05.724]  He hired Limbaugh, he created Limbaugh, Roger Ailes.
[01:03:06.605 --> 01:03:16.750]  Going back in the minute we've got left, sorry about those cutouts, John, in L.A., you heard me say that four years ago, and I've been saying it ever since, that you would hear Limbaugh and Doris Hillary, didn't you?
[01:03:17.591 --> 01:03:18.351]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:03:21.158 --> 01:03:47.033]  You know, I mean, you had to know this was going to happen, especially, I mean, especially getting my information from you every day, which I enjoy, but I've just been waiting for that to happen, and now you see, they ran a liberal like McCain, and all the Republicans hate him, and that gives perfect thing for Ann Coulter and Russ Limbaugh just to turn and say, oh, it's not worth it to even vote Republican, just let Hillary get in there and we'll try to do it through the Congress.
[01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:50.592]  Stay there, I want to finish up with this, then go to Pastor Butch and others.
[01:03:50.612 --> 01:03:51.272]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.014 --> 01:04:01.940]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.582]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[01:05:07.074 --> 01:05:13.776]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:05:14.156 --> 01:05:14.576]  We're good to go.
[01:05:44.116 --> 01:05:57.499]  The IRS garnished my wages, put a lien on our home and levied our bank account.
[01:05:57.679 --> 01:05:58.999]  I had no idea what to do.
[01:05:59.279 --> 01:06:01.359]  Then my attorney told me about Assured Tax Relief.
[01:06:01.579 --> 01:06:03.540]  Calling them was the best thing I've ever done.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.740]  They got us a settlement with the IRS that we could manage.

[01:06:48.011 --> 01:06:50.892]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:50.912 --> 01:06:52.212]  Because there's a war on through your mind.
[01:07:07.052 --> 01:07:13.935]  Yeah, I've seen blurbs, but I haven't heard the audio yet that Limbaugh's been saying Hillary is better than McCain.
[01:07:15.395 --> 01:07:16.796]  And you can see what they did.
[01:07:17.476 --> 01:07:20.497]  No longer was controlling our borders, 2nd Amendment,
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.961]  Lower taxes, Bill of Rights, Constitution, Republican.
[01:07:25.621 --> 01:07:27.782]  Everything was killing Islamofascist.
[01:07:28.422 --> 01:07:31.663]  Just, just, you could bring up corruption in the government.
[01:07:31.703 --> 01:07:36.485]  You could bring up a politician, you know, having sex with pages.
[01:07:36.905 --> 01:07:38.925]  And they'd say, doesn't matter, I fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:07:40.166 --> 01:07:42.767]  Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda.
[01:07:43.847 --> 01:07:45.267]  They literally just repeat it.
[01:07:45.748 --> 01:07:50.289]  And anytime you say to somebody with a George W. sticker, hey, he's not a conservative, they just go, Al-Qaeda!
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.501]  Now, McCain has said that he supports all these wars.
[01:07:55.081 --> 01:07:57.081]  McCain has said he's for attacking Iran.
[01:07:57.541 --> 01:08:00.062]  He is known as the worst warmonger ever.
[01:08:02.403 --> 01:08:16.926]  Pat Buchanan wrote a story just two days ago saying that, I forget the exact headline, but it was something like, John McCain to make George Bush look like a peacenik.
[01:08:19.587 --> 01:08:20.227]  And he wrote
[01:08:20.874 --> 01:08:30.359]  Through all of the places where McCain is just saying he'll basically start World War III and 100-year wars.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.702]  But that doesn't matter if he's actually a warmonger and absolutely on AIPAC's payroll.
[01:08:36.583 --> 01:08:37.163]  It doesn't matter.
[01:08:37.984 --> 01:08:40.785]  The neocons just say he's anti-war.
[01:08:42.446 --> 01:08:43.427]  They just say it.
[01:08:44.247 --> 01:08:45.588]  And now we've got to support Hillary.
[01:08:46.264 --> 01:08:47.305]  She is the anointed one.
[01:08:47.365 --> 01:08:48.426]  She is CIA.
[01:08:48.446 --> 01:08:51.348]  I've been telling you this for years, folks!
[01:08:52.109 --> 01:08:58.994]  I mean, it really came out that Roger Ailes and Fox News and the White House are writing her speeches and she's following orders!
[01:09:01.276 --> 01:09:04.879]  And the White House came out a few months ago and said she's the best candidate from the Democrats.
[01:09:05.719 --> 01:09:10.483]  And you watch, man, you're going to hear all the talk shows and the rest of them saying hail Hillary.
[01:09:13.343 --> 01:09:16.304]  They know we're going into the New World Order and they're going to serve it, folks.
[01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.424]  And let me tell you, your conservative neighbor?
[01:09:19.124 --> 01:09:20.865]  They're going to start telling you abortion's good.
[01:09:21.205 --> 01:09:23.445]  Folks, I'm not joking about this.
[01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.746]  Open borders is going to be good.
[01:09:26.326 --> 01:09:27.606]  Abortion's going to be good.
[01:09:28.006 --> 01:09:29.227]  Hillary's going to be good.
[01:09:29.847 --> 01:09:31.107]  Gun control's going to be good.
[01:09:31.147 --> 01:09:33.228]  The NRA just supported the biggest gun control bill ever.
[01:09:33.548 --> 01:09:35.588]  You're seeing the betrayal right now.
[01:09:36.468 --> 01:09:39.049]  They're showing you who they are right now.
[01:09:41.787 --> 01:09:54.570]  And I'm about to go to Pastor Butch Paul and Jeff Becker, talking about police state on multiple levels, but we're going to go to Paige, Mario, Isaac, Fred, and others.
[01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:55.750]  I promise we're going to get to all of you.
[01:09:56.191 --> 01:10:00.452]  But going back to John in L.A., you were finishing up your point.
[01:10:01.972 --> 01:10:02.612]  Yeah.
[01:10:03.912 --> 01:10:05.533]  You've seen this coming for a long time.
[01:10:05.553 --> 01:10:08.074]  I don't know if you ever read that book by Murray Rothbard.
[01:10:08.094 --> 01:10:09.914]  It's called The Betrayal of the American Right.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.260]  Yes, we interviewed him.
[01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:17.062]  Yeah, it's, you know, it's along the same lines as that.
[01:10:17.122 --> 01:10:25.206]  They start with semantical, you know, gymnastics, like the neoconservatives did back in the fifties.
[01:10:25.426 --> 01:10:31.088]  It's just a trotskyite, but you just start calling yourself a conservative, but you don't change any of your ideas.
[01:10:31.168 --> 01:10:36.370]  Well, that's why Woolsey running McCain's campaign, we have that clip.
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.962]  Last week, we never played that, John.
[01:10:38.982 --> 01:10:39.782]  Can you dig that out?
[01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:41.804]  It's the James Woolsey CNN clip.
[01:10:42.244 --> 01:10:48.589]  He says, we want the support of Trotskyites, and then he giggled and made this little evil face and like winked.
[01:10:49.049 --> 01:10:49.970]  They're just telling it.
[01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.410]  I saw that.
[01:10:51.631 --> 01:10:53.693]  Oh, it's so much fun.
[01:10:54.794 --> 01:10:55.654]  Look, look, look, look.
[01:10:55.694 --> 01:10:56.235]  I'm not joking.
[01:10:56.275 --> 01:11:00.058]  I said Limbaugh would endorse Hillary, and I'm not kidding.
[01:11:00.138 --> 01:11:04.181]  It will get to the point where conservatives will be wearing hammer and sickles on their arms.
[01:11:05.802 --> 01:11:06.543]  I totally agree.
[01:11:07.605 --> 01:11:11.789]  You know, everybody out there needs to go read Road to Serfdom by F.A.
[01:11:11.829 --> 01:11:12.269]  Hayek.
[01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:13.430]  Excellent book.
[01:11:14.551 --> 01:11:17.033]  That's where I kind of spun the name, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:18.114]  I appreciate your call.
[01:11:18.414 --> 01:11:19.535]  Listen, I don't have the personnel.
[01:11:19.615 --> 01:11:23.639]  I've got Curt Nemo, I've got Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes that are main writers.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.942]  You are of great minds out there.
[01:11:27.002 --> 01:11:27.682]  Write an article.
[01:11:27.863 --> 01:11:29.064]  All of you write articles about this.
[01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:30.124]  Don't count on somebody else.
[01:11:30.405 --> 01:11:31.666]  Go through the history of this.
[01:11:33.271 --> 01:11:36.274]  I've got the website so we'll get it out to millions of people, but I need your help.
[01:11:36.574 --> 01:11:39.356]  I need you to go dig out all the clips, or just one or two of them.
[01:11:39.376 --> 01:11:44.020]  I say it every week for years, at least five years, that you would see Rush Limbaugh endorse Hillary.
[01:11:45.441 --> 01:11:50.466]  I know that Coulter and others have now been doing it, and I'm getting a bunch of emails about Limbaugh doing it in the last few days.
[01:11:51.867 --> 01:11:54.109]  So, I mean, I said it would happen.
[01:11:55.137 --> 01:11:56.478]  Of course it was going to happen!
[01:11:56.538 --> 01:11:58.199]  Alright, I apologize for having him hold.
[01:11:58.539 --> 01:11:59.239]  Great friend of mine.
[01:11:59.279 --> 01:12:02.081]  He's on the Genesis Network, 8 o'clock Central, 9 o'clock Eastern.
[01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:02.961]  He's from West Virginia.
[01:12:03.282 --> 01:12:06.243]  He's a pastor, Vietnam, veteran in black ops.
[01:12:07.124 --> 01:12:09.285]  And he's running for governor in West Virginia.
[01:12:09.305 --> 01:12:11.546]  And regardless, he wins because he educates people.
[01:12:11.906 --> 01:12:13.547]  They're fighting the national ID card there.
[01:12:13.807 --> 01:12:16.028]  We're going to briefly talk about his story with Mr. Becker.
[01:12:16.048 --> 01:12:17.869]  I didn't know Mr. Becker was coming on today, but that's fine.
[01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:20.451]  We've had Mr. Becker on for many guests, twice.
[01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:26.460]  But I want to also get into how Butch helped break the story about the preachers being recruited for martial law.
[01:12:26.781 --> 01:12:30.002]  That's now mainstream news and is being expanded.
[01:12:30.402 --> 01:12:34.804]  And I have more stories on that today along that similar line.
[01:12:35.224 --> 01:12:40.467]  But Butch, in a nutshell, tell us what happened to Mr. Becker and then we'll go to him.
[01:12:40.487 --> 01:12:41.347]  I appreciate it very much.
[01:12:41.867 --> 01:12:46.049]  I really wish that we could say that we have been wrong all these years.
[01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:50.372]  But we've been proven right over and over again, and it's just, it's heartbreaking.
[01:12:50.452 --> 01:12:52.413]  But back to the issue of what you asked me about.
[01:12:52.993 --> 01:13:00.817]  As everybody knows, most people know after listening to my broadcast, I'm running for governor, trying to, on the Constitution Party here in the state of West Virginia, try and get on the ballot.
[01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:06.939]  We had acquired a man, Jeff Becker, to help us do that, and he was doing a great job.
[01:13:07.179 --> 01:13:12.422]  If he hadn't been arrested two months ago, I would have already had ballot access here in West Virginia.
[01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:18.782]  Well, Jeff Beck was arrested two months ago in a little town called Westover, West Virginia, on trumped-up charges.
[01:13:18.902 --> 01:13:24.869]  A month later, a month later, they tacked on a felony charge of possession of a deadly weapon.
[01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:29.734]  And now, of course, his hearing is coming up this Monday at 9.30 a.m.
[01:13:29.774 --> 01:13:30.315]  Eastern Time.
[01:13:30.994 --> 01:13:35.958]  Uh... in Morgantown, West Virginia, he's uh... he's uh... hearing uh... I guess he'll probably go pursue his pursuit of his crime.
[01:13:35.998 --> 01:13:37.800]  Now, let's recap what happened here.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:42.503]  Uh... he was standing out on the sidewalk getting petitions.
[01:13:42.544 --> 01:13:42.884]  Yes.
[01:13:42.944 --> 01:13:45.506]  He'd been told he could at a government training camp, a school.
[01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:45.726]  Yes.
[01:13:46.487 --> 01:13:48.348]  And then when did the deadly weapon thing come along?
[01:13:48.428 --> 01:13:52.672]  Well, I'll let him tell the story better than I can, but to tell you how he was become
[01:13:53.753 --> 01:13:56.014]  We had Jeff the Broadcaster Monday night.
[01:13:56.395 --> 01:13:57.816]  He put out some numbers for people to call.
[01:13:57.836 --> 01:14:00.058]  I had callers call some people here in the area.
[01:14:00.498 --> 01:14:04.121]  One caller, Jack Barkinsaw, called the cop that arrested Jeff.
[01:14:04.561 --> 01:14:07.804]  The cop literally cussed Jack.
[01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:15.150]  I mean, Jack's had him cussed like that for years, and threatened to come to Arkansas and arrest him for West Virginia.
[01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:16.131]  Now, this is a true story.
[01:14:16.713 --> 01:14:38.896]  But Jeff's story, he can tell better than I can, that the felony charges was tacked on a month later because he was getting, as soon as he was near a school zone on a public sidewalk, he had a pocket knife, which was not illegal, but nonetheless, the cops on a recorded message called Jeff on his home phone and said, if you don't come back, on the third attempt, Jeff wasn't home, he was with his parents for the holidays,
[01:14:39.329 --> 01:14:44.913]  Well, the third attempt, the cops said, if you don't call him back, we're going to attack on a felony charge to you, bro.
[01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:45.813]  He called him bro.
[01:14:46.253 --> 01:14:47.214]  Jeff has that on recording.
[01:14:47.954 --> 01:14:49.956]  We're going to attack a felony charge on him, and he did.
[01:14:49.976 --> 01:14:53.658]  And I'll let Jeff tell the rest of the story if you like, Alex, but that's the way it is.
[01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:54.358]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:14:54.539 --> 01:14:58.581]  I didn't know that this was going to happen today, so I wasn't prepared.
[01:14:58.641 --> 01:14:59.462]  I knew the story.
[01:14:59.942 --> 01:15:00.883]  You're on at night.
[01:15:01.443 --> 01:15:06.266]  They've been scrambling to find this phone recording in the computer that was sent to the network.
[01:15:06.566 --> 01:15:07.807]  Were you able to find that, John?
[01:15:11.970 --> 01:15:14.392]  Okay, they found the file on the computer, but it's corrupted.
[01:15:14.892 --> 01:15:16.153]  But you did play that on your show.
[01:15:16.293 --> 01:15:17.674]  Let me stop you, Butch.
[01:15:18.134 --> 01:15:18.934]  There's a way to do this.
[01:15:19.355 --> 01:15:22.597]  What time in your show, Monday, did you play this?
[01:15:22.637 --> 01:15:24.478]  They can go to the archive and cut it out of the show.
[01:15:24.578 --> 01:15:26.819]  About 9.35, thereabouts.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:31.702]  Okay, 35 minutes into Butch's show, Monday.
[01:15:32.202 --> 01:15:33.443]  John, you can go get it there.
[01:15:33.703 --> 01:15:35.124]  Okay, there we go.
[01:15:35.625 --> 01:15:36.265]  Please continue.
[01:15:36.847 --> 01:15:42.794]  Okay, if you'd like to let Jeff tell the story about his arrest, that would be probably the best way to cover that.
[01:15:42.855 --> 01:15:46.279]  And I would like to talk to you about the FEMA pastors, and this is happening right now.
[01:15:46.299 --> 01:15:55.210]  As a matter of fact, a friend of mine took a picture of a Harrison County FEMA clergy patrol in Harrison County, West Virginia, a few months ago.
[01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:56.271]  They're already out there.
[01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:58.273]  If Jeff's there, Alex... Patrolling!
[01:15:58.313 --> 01:16:04.035]  I have articles with the FBI's hiring auxiliary, hiring business owners, just spies everywhere.
[01:16:04.235 --> 01:16:05.676]  Well, this is a Kyrgyz Kyrgyz.
[01:16:05.796 --> 01:16:06.797]  This is a brand new car.
[01:16:06.817 --> 01:16:09.978]  No, I understand, but they're also hiring just everybody.
[01:16:10.138 --> 01:16:10.758]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:11.779 --> 01:16:12.219]  Absolutely.
[01:16:12.339 --> 01:16:14.680]  I mean, absolute Soviet Union, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.621]  Absolute Nazi Germany.
[01:16:17.061 --> 01:16:20.283]  Actually, Jeff has been on twice before to briefly tell his story.
[01:16:21.081 --> 01:16:29.125]  I think the bigger issue here is that they arrested him and then now found the deadly pocket knife, the weapon of mass destruction.
[01:16:29.625 --> 01:16:33.467]  I mean, Jeff, why did they tack on the felony?
[01:16:34.668 --> 01:16:37.289]  I don't know.
[01:16:37.329 --> 01:16:47.995]  My only thought would be that because I requested a jury trial, my hearing for the misdemeanors was December 19th, and this felony charge came up December 21st.
[01:16:49.534 --> 01:16:50.894]  After I requested a jury trial.
[01:16:52.735 --> 01:16:58.597]  So that's the new system, and how big was this nuclear weapon you had in your pocket?
[01:16:58.897 --> 01:17:17.783]  Well, it had to have been under three and a half inches because this arresting officer Hoffler and his buddy and the other cop and the clerk, Kelly Neville, they sat there with a ruler and the three of them were triangulating and trying to figure out how to measure my knife to make it longer than three and a half and I couldn't so they gave it back to me.
[01:17:18.621 --> 01:17:19.481]  Before Thanksgiving.
[01:17:19.862 --> 01:17:22.083]  If you want this phone message, I have it on email.
[01:17:22.103 --> 01:17:22.543]  I can send it to you.
[01:17:40.575 --> 01:17:44.236]  Okay, well we can put you on hold and see if John can get your email from you.
[01:17:44.896 --> 01:17:47.317]  But we're going to play that phone message coming up.
[01:17:47.637 --> 01:17:49.797]  The big issue here is, this is happening everywhere.
[01:17:49.817 --> 01:17:54.358]  People arrested for being on the street talking to other Americans is now illegal.
[01:17:55.238 --> 01:17:58.819]  This is not the first time that the people who were helping me were harassed by the cops.
[01:17:58.839 --> 01:18:00.899]  This happened at least two or three times before.
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.020]  They were running off public property.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:06.122]  Well, you're not supposed to talk to people on the street!
[01:18:06.142 --> 01:18:06.642]  This is martial law!
[01:18:06.662 --> 01:18:08.063]  I don't know if Jeff's still there.
[01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:08.503]  I don't know.
[01:18:08.543 --> 01:18:10.044]  I believe Jeff's gone to get the email.
[01:18:29.122 --> 01:18:31.943]  And then, of course, a month later, the felony charges tacked on.
[01:18:32.303 --> 01:18:38.065]  And I know it's a pure tactic, but the cop is so belligerent that he actually cussed one of the listeners who called and asked him why he did that.
[01:18:38.645 --> 01:18:40.486]  And threatened to arrest him in Arkansas.
[01:18:41.726 --> 01:18:45.548]  Well, you're not supposed to use a telephone in America either, Butch.
[01:18:46.168 --> 01:18:47.568]  You think this is a free country, buddy?
[01:18:47.969 --> 01:18:48.749]  How dare you!
[01:18:49.169 --> 01:18:50.069]  How dare you!
[01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:52.070]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.730]  A new world order.
[01:18:58.493 --> 01:19:02.737]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:19:03.378 --> 01:19:05.139]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.442]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:19:09.003 --> 01:19:11.445]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:12.186 --> 01:19:19.472]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.489 --> 01:19:27.472]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:27.952 --> 01:19:31.174]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:31.194 --> 01:19:34.315]  The overburden is making great progress for the world government.
[01:19:34.375 --> 01:19:35.516]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.536 --> 01:19:36.296]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.316 --> 01:19:37.397]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.597 --> 01:19:38.357]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.578 --> 01:19:39.338]  That's what happens here.
[01:19:39.738 --> 01:19:47.922]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:48.042 --> 01:19:50.804]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:19:51.268 --> 01:19:52.320]  You have been warned.
[01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:53.795]  It's a fact.
[01:19:54.016 --> 01:20:01.500]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:10.485]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:20:10.765 --> 01:20:21.291]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:20:21.551 --> 01:20:27.613]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:20:27.833 --> 01:20:32.855]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:20:33.035 --> 01:20:37.516]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:20:37.676 --> 01:20:39.477]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:20:39.537 --> 01:20:39.797]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:20:39.817 --> 01:20:40.237]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:20:40.337 --> 01:20:42.218]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.381]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:55.162]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[01:20:55.442 --> 01:20:58.063]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[01:20:58.363 --> 01:21:06.685]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[01:21:06.965 --> 01:21:09.806]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[01:21:10.646 --> 01:21:13.867]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[01:21:15.167 --> 01:21:16.748]  How much are you willing to lose?
[01:21:17.148 --> 01:21:18.089]  Take action now!
[01:21:18.209 --> 01:21:22.113]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[01:21:23.033 --> 01:21:26.797]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[01:21:27.017 --> 01:21:30.240]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:36.786]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[01:21:37.066 --> 01:21:39.107]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[01:21:39.147 --> 01:21:40.208]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:42.049]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[01:21:52.017 --> 01:21:53.378]  Ted Anders from Midas, February 8, 2007.
[01:21:53.598 --> 01:21:56.301]  Gold 319 10 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $339.52, $462.75 per half, $231.38 per quarter.
[01:21:56.341 --> 01:21:56.781]  That's $939.52, $462.75, and $231.38.
[01:22:07.737 --> 01:22:10.297]  Edgerton's caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[01:22:10.337 --> 01:22:12.098]  The bond market continues to slump.
[01:22:12.278 --> 01:22:12.578]  J.P.
[01:22:12.618 --> 01:22:15.518]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[01:22:15.558 --> 01:22:17.719]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[01:22:17.799 --> 01:22:22.540]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.000]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:29.421]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[01:22:29.781 --> 01:22:30.181]  The U.S.
[01:22:30.221 --> 01:22:34.482]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:36.302]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[01:22:36.722 --> 01:22:39.465]  Economist Rudy Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[01:22:39.725 --> 01:22:41.046]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:22:42.227 --> 01:22:46.491]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:22:46.551 --> 01:22:46.771]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:46.811 --> 01:22:46.991]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:08.696 --> 01:23:11.860]  Okay, so Jeff Becker, how can we help you?
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:12.661]  What can we do?
[01:23:12.681 --> 01:23:22.172]  Actually, I'm pretty confident things will work out here on Monday, but I want to follow some civil action.
[01:23:22.273 --> 01:23:24.155]  I haven't been able to work in basically two months.
[01:23:25.221 --> 01:23:28.464]  Oh, by the way, John wasn't able to get that clip, so he's going to put you on hold.
[01:23:28.844 --> 01:23:32.186]  If you can email it to him in 30 seconds, I mean, fast, we can do it.
[01:23:32.206 --> 01:23:35.789]  If not, we're going to have to scrap this, because I didn't know any of this was coming out today, and we weren't prepared.
[01:23:36.269 --> 01:23:37.450]  All right, I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:23:38.191 --> 01:23:42.494]  Butch, I see this everywhere now, the free speech zones, the arrest.
[01:23:43.201 --> 01:23:43.602]  All of it.
[01:23:43.622 --> 01:23:44.542]  And the cops don't know.
[01:23:44.582 --> 01:23:46.724]  They're having fluoride put in their water by design.
[01:23:47.064 --> 01:23:48.546]  Their children are being poisoned.
[01:23:49.126 --> 01:23:50.467]  All of this stuff is happening.
[01:23:50.828 --> 01:23:52.549]  They think they're working for the winning side.
[01:23:52.789 --> 01:23:55.992]  They call us civilians in all these newscasts now.
[01:23:56.292 --> 01:23:57.413]  Police are civilians.
[01:23:57.813 --> 01:23:59.174]  Unless we're under martial law.
[01:23:59.835 --> 01:24:04.859]  And in a way I just feel sorry for these police and these police forces.
[01:24:05.099 --> 01:24:06.120]  They're not all like this.
[01:24:06.661 --> 01:24:08.122]  Who just think we're scum.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.001]  Obviously that's true.
[01:24:11.082 --> 01:24:14.264]  They really believe in their hearts that they are the law.
[01:24:15.064 --> 01:24:17.666]  They will not tolerate questioning their authority.
[01:24:18.187 --> 01:24:23.871]  Jeff Becker offered the cops to stand by the cruiser until you get your ride home.
[01:24:24.271 --> 01:24:26.472]  He said, I'll just sit here on the park bench and wait.
[01:24:26.513 --> 01:24:27.433]  He went to walk away and
[01:24:34.508 --> 01:24:35.029]  Yes, Butch.
[01:24:53.357 --> 01:24:56.679]  The pocket knife fact will prove that it wasn't over three and a half inches.
[01:24:56.719 --> 01:24:58.180]  Plus, how have we gotten to the point?
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:02.643]  You should get in trouble for stabbing somebody with a knife, or brandishing a knife, not having one.
[01:25:02.683 --> 01:25:12.770]  We've been, we've gone from having rifles in our cars, you drive around in Texas now with a rifle in your pickup truck, they're going to SWAT team you, they're going to have armored vehicles, they're going to announce that Al-Qaeda landed.
[01:25:13.433 --> 01:25:28.035]  Well, we have seen, and I'm quite a bit older than you are, but I have seen in my lifetime, you've seen in your lifetime, this country go from somewhat of a normal society of freedoms being accepted as natural to the point now where you dare question anyone's authority.
[01:25:28.075 --> 01:25:28.896]  I don't care if it's a cop.
[01:25:29.765 --> 01:25:33.410]  Or a magistrate or a judge.
[01:25:34.031 --> 01:25:38.538]  You question any authority, you're now considered literally a terrorist.
[01:25:38.818 --> 01:25:44.968]  As a matter of fact, they're passing a law in Mississippi right now, trying to Mississippi, that restaurants cannot serve obese people.
[01:25:45.814 --> 01:25:52.701]  And they're going to, as indentured servants without being paid, have to enforce that and it says get tape measures out.
[01:25:53.302 --> 01:26:03.152]  Again, this is the social worker control grid where every aspect of your life, the government's going to control your thermostats by remote control, everything you buy and sell is to be tracked.
[01:26:04.053 --> 01:26:10.979]  But the Homeland Security says they're federalizing the IDs, and to buy beer, cigarettes, cold medicine, you're going to have to be federally scanned.
[01:26:11.299 --> 01:26:12.600]  Total control!
[01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:16.404]  But the illegal aliens, they don't have to show an ID to get a bank account.
[01:26:16.704 --> 01:26:18.926]  Well, if you want to lose weight, move to Mississippi, I guess.
[01:26:18.946 --> 01:26:20.767]  But this is where we are in America.
[01:26:21.148 --> 01:26:22.089]  Wildest dreams.
[01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:23.930]  I'm going to be on the radio next month.
[01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.831]  I'm 14 years, Alex.
[01:26:25.131 --> 01:26:25.711]  That's right
[01:26:55.391 --> 01:27:06.101]  Well, they have cameras now that will scan your face, and if your face is distorted or you look like you may be upset or agitated, they'll read your thoughts, so to speak, and you can be pulled aside at an airport, pulled aside on the street.
[01:27:06.121 --> 01:27:07.462]  And it's all pure quackery.
[01:27:07.502 --> 01:27:09.484]  They've proven that a lot of detectors don't work.
[01:27:09.844 --> 01:27:19.593]  So now they've come out with systems, passive MRIs in five airports now, that are supposedly scanning your brain, and if your brain won't excuse to drag you off.
[01:27:20.534 --> 01:27:23.656]  Well, we live in exciting times to be in this battle, that's for sure.
[01:27:24.177 --> 01:27:27.079]  But I wonder how a police officer could arrest Jeff.
[01:27:27.119 --> 01:27:29.101]  He seems like a very nice fellow.
[01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:32.964]  And then they let him go for the knife.
[01:27:33.624 --> 01:27:35.546]  They didn't arrest him for that.
[01:27:36.126 --> 01:27:38.649]  And then now they just slap the charge on a month later.
[01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:43.031]  I wonder if they sleep good at night falsely charging people?
[01:27:43.331 --> 01:27:45.092]  That is a huge sin!
[01:27:45.212 --> 01:28:01.581]  Well, he's the second one in that little town next to there, by the name of Granville, where another friend of mine, a preacher friend of mine, this is no lie, I know this, it's hard to believe, he pulled out of the road to watch the lightning, and a cop arrested him that night for watching the lightning.
[01:28:01.601 --> 01:28:06.203]  No other reason I know of, and he's still facing charges on this, and this is a true story.
[01:28:07.006 --> 01:28:08.087]  Charges for what?
[01:28:09.748 --> 01:28:14.612]  For not having a proper idea, I think, on him or whatever, when the cop pulled behind his, what are you doing here?
[01:28:14.632 --> 01:28:16.333]  The preacher said, I'm watching God's handiwork.
[01:28:17.173 --> 01:28:19.755]  And he showed us an idea, it wasn't up to date, and they arrested him.
[01:28:21.076 --> 01:28:22.677]  But he wouldn't arrest an illegal alien.
[01:28:22.737 --> 01:28:24.519]  I've had Austin cops come into my face.
[01:28:24.619 --> 01:28:26.860]  They don't arrest illegals for no idea.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:31.444]  But citizen scum, we're here to be milked like cattle, like hogs!
[01:28:31.704 --> 01:28:32.664]  We're on the march.
[01:28:33.105 --> 01:28:34.606]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:35.602 --> 01:28:38.291]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:43.594]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:28:43.714 --> 01:28:48.875]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:28:48.895 --> 01:28:50.415]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:28:50.675 --> 01:28:58.677]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:28:58.897 --> 01:29:04.699]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:29:04.819 --> 01:29:06.559]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:29:06.659 --> 01:29:08.660]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:09.120]  I think so.
[01:29:23.865 --> 01:29:32.933]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment, but as acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:29:50.067 --> 01:29:50.587]  I think so.
[01:30:10.439 --> 01:30:14.961]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:30:15.261 --> 01:30:16.021]  Do your part.
[01:30:16.301 --> 01:30:18.582]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[01:30:18.922 --> 01:30:27.345]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[01:30:41.582 --> 01:30:43.883]  Have you ever wanted the truth about the economy?
[01:30:44.163 --> 01:30:44.623]  Crash!
[01:30:44.863 --> 01:30:45.603]  Are You Ready?

[01:30:49.225 --> 01:30:53.707]  Our one-hour program airs Monday through Friday from 10 to 11 a.m.
[01:30:53.907 --> 01:30:58.489]  Central Time, just after the Power Hour and just before Alex Jones.

[01:31:22.961 --> 01:31:26.103]  We also focus on alternative health and survival topics.

[01:31:27.886 --> 01:31:29.890]  That's H-E-A-R-I-T-O-N-L-I-N-E.com.
[01:31:53.371 --> 01:31:54.172]  Look at this report.
[01:31:54.252 --> 01:31:55.333]  Local 6 News.
[01:31:55.594 --> 01:31:58.798]  Police swabbing mouths during traffic stops and serial killer hunt.
[01:31:58.838 --> 01:32:00.259]  Genetically, we know who he is.
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:01.320]  Chitwood said.
[01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:04.905]  We have DNA evidence from the murder scene, so we've got that.
[01:32:05.265 --> 01:32:10.451]  This is never sooner or later we will match the DNA to the physical person and bring closure to everything that is going on.
[01:32:10.471 --> 01:32:13.515]  And it says they're just going around at checkpoints and road stops.
[01:32:14.142 --> 01:32:36.996]  Just saying, okay, you might be a serial killer, no judge, no jury, no warrant, no cause, and I see this now in case after case, as if the serial killer won't leave the area, as if he won't move away, as if the serial killer won't stop, as if in a city, Daytona Beach, with thousands of people, over 100,000 males,
[01:32:41.337 --> 01:32:44.238]  I'm looking for the government just to say, every male, show up and give your DNA.
[01:32:44.338 --> 01:32:46.698]  And they're getting it from the kids in the schools, everything else.
[01:32:47.298 --> 01:32:48.519]  That isn't America.
[01:32:48.779 --> 01:32:50.579]  Stop a serial killer.
[01:32:51.279 --> 01:32:52.519]  It's always a good reason.
[01:32:52.539 --> 01:32:54.620]  Can you imagine the cop pulls you over?
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:58.201]  By the way, in England, for about four years, they stop you for speeding.
[01:32:58.221 --> 01:33:00.841]  They take the same cheek swab and put it in the database.
[01:33:01.481 --> 01:33:03.582]  The feds have proposed making everybody give DNA.
[01:33:05.777 --> 01:33:13.600]  And let me tell you, you don't do it, cop will taser you, they'll take that billy club and brain open, till brains go all over, and it can all be on videotape.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:14.640]  Nothing's gonna happen!
[01:33:15.481 --> 01:33:20.882]  Our murder, and it's happening every day, people were killed by these tasers, is a good thing!
[01:33:20.943 --> 01:33:22.023]  It's a holy thing!
[01:33:22.323 --> 01:33:24.404]  It's something that's loved and cherished!
[01:33:26.845 --> 01:33:31.766]  And again, the police are just ghoul zombies, the ones that carry out this type of activity.
[01:33:31.786 --> 01:33:33.167]  And the Founding Fathers would say that too.
[01:33:34.571 --> 01:33:37.573]  Now, all departments aren't like this, but a lot of them are.
[01:33:38.653 --> 01:33:42.555]  That's what tyranny is, is when the government goes bad.
[01:33:42.575 --> 01:34:00.284]  I mean, I've seen the Seattle Post-Intelligencer admitting that in one of the fancy areas of Seattle, cops own half the bars, because they go in, shell drugs to another cop, yeah, not even an informant to somebody, in a bathroom, and will take all these bars, and then the cops themselves own them and run them.
[01:34:01.218 --> 01:34:02.719]  And that's what tyranny is like, folks.
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.882]  Just people in black uniforms, owning, running everything.
[01:34:06.122 --> 01:34:07.023]  You gotta worship them.
[01:34:07.043 --> 01:34:08.243]  You gotta give them your daughters.
[01:34:08.564 --> 01:34:10.385]  You gotta just, oh, you're the king.
[01:34:10.445 --> 01:34:11.106]  You're God.
[01:34:11.126 --> 01:34:13.948]  And then they all selectively enforce.
[01:34:14.388 --> 01:34:16.130]  I've got to get you back up in the near future.
[01:34:16.170 --> 01:34:17.210]  We're just out of time.
[01:34:17.691 --> 01:34:20.873]  I wanted to get in, and we couldn't open that email.
[01:34:20.973 --> 01:34:22.434]  We couldn't get it out of the computer.
[01:34:22.474 --> 01:34:25.797]  So, at a later date, we'll play that clip of the police officer doing that.
[01:34:25.817 --> 01:34:26.037]  I know.
[01:34:26.377 --> 01:34:27.758]  It's in the archive of your show, Monday.
[01:34:28.439 --> 01:34:29.860]  But finishing up with the pastors.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:30.841]  Two years ago,
[01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:46.964]  I guess back in 2006, almost two years ago, you came on air, we had another pastor on air out of Ohio, another pastor came forward, they gave us the documents, they've been recruited to train their people for gun confiscation, and that is criminal, by the way.
[01:34:47.484 --> 01:34:49.847]  Taking our guns, martial law is evil.
[01:34:51.148 --> 01:34:52.129]  No, it's the law!
[01:34:52.209 --> 01:34:53.531]  We're law enforcers!
[01:34:54.832 --> 01:34:55.793]  That's what they say in China.
[01:34:56.964 --> 01:35:05.292]  And training them to go to camps, break up our families, and now you've got mobile tattletale squads with preachers driving around.
[01:35:05.312 --> 01:35:07.794]  They're recruiting the truck drivers, the citizens.
[01:35:07.834 --> 01:35:09.035]  I've got more news on today.
[01:35:09.616 --> 01:35:10.717]  Give us any updates, Butch.
[01:35:10.937 --> 01:35:20.446]  Well, just a couple months ago, I have a couple of members of the church I pastor for several years now, who live in Harrison County, West Virginia.
[01:35:21.193 --> 01:35:21.953]  I don't know.
[01:35:40.388 --> 01:35:41.189]  To prove it was there.
[01:35:41.209 --> 01:35:45.892]  It had temporary tags on it, so it was a new car.
[01:35:46.572 --> 01:35:47.453]  I don't know who bought it for him.
[01:35:47.473 --> 01:35:51.336]  I don't know whether it was sponsored by the government or he bought it himself.
[01:35:51.956 --> 01:36:06.726]  But the clergy have been told, and this is ongoing and still growing, they're trying to get into more churches to tell the churches that the pastors need to be there as part of the response team to have the people to be calm and quiet and obey orders.
[01:36:07.318 --> 01:36:09.119]  Now, you mentioned DNA a minute ago.
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:14.962]  In a little town called Matuchin, New Jersey, they have a DNA service in America.
[01:36:15.883 --> 01:36:17.103]  You can actually call them.
[01:36:17.183 --> 01:36:18.944]  They will do testing for you.
[01:36:18.964 --> 01:36:20.745]  It says, seeking the truth when it matters the most.
[01:36:21.205 --> 01:36:27.929]  To find out who your children are, if they're really your children, if your grandchild is really yours or not.
[01:36:28.309 --> 01:36:35.693]  All these things are coming together, and they're calling in the churches, and the pastor's telling people to please submit to this, because it's for our own safety.
[01:36:36.073 --> 01:36:46.722]  The video on our website, PastorButch.com, they can watch for themselves, where a preacher says, let's obey the government now, Romans 13 says they have to, we'll sort out the differences later.
[01:36:47.002 --> 01:36:51.586]  Now that's how naive or stupid, either way, these people are.
[01:36:51.686 --> 01:36:55.149]  Yeah, that's a NBC News report, we've played it many times.
[01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:57.549]  And they admit it's for martial law.
[01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:59.550]  They say the government is the boss.
[01:36:59.830 --> 01:37:01.410]  We must follow their needs.
[01:37:01.751 --> 01:37:03.911]  I thought we are the government.
[01:37:04.191 --> 01:37:05.551]  Again, this is tyranny.
[01:37:05.771 --> 01:37:12.393]  And in closing, Jeff Becker, we'll have you back on once we're able to get that audio clip, and we'll all be praying for you.
[01:37:12.933 --> 01:37:14.213]  I appreciate you coming on, Jeff.
[01:37:14.314 --> 01:37:14.994]  Alright, thanks again.
[01:37:15.034 --> 01:37:15.414]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:37:15.434 --> 01:37:15.954]  Appreciate it.
[01:37:16.214 --> 01:37:16.554]  You bet.
[01:37:16.674 --> 01:37:18.074]  And, Bush, we'll talk to you soon.
[01:37:18.234 --> 01:37:18.955]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:37:18.975 --> 01:37:19.615]  Talk to you soon.
[01:37:19.895 --> 01:37:20.355]  Take care.
[01:37:21.283 --> 01:37:22.384]  Folks, it exhausts me.
[01:37:22.504 --> 01:37:24.565]  I don't even like getting up here bashing police.
[01:37:24.825 --> 01:37:25.866]  I'm just sick of it all.
[01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:27.006]  I just, I mean, I know.
[01:37:27.227 --> 01:37:28.808]  I know you're being hit with chemical weapons.
[01:37:29.348 --> 01:37:30.409]  I know you're under attack.
[01:37:30.469 --> 01:37:33.450]  I know you're brain damaged, just like the general public.
[01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:36.012]  And most of you can't even understand what I'm saying right now.
[01:37:36.812 --> 01:37:38.373]  I know you're giggling and laughing about it.
[01:37:38.393 --> 01:37:39.394]  I know you're not going to listen.
[01:37:39.414 --> 01:37:40.895]  You're not going to stop using cell phones.
[01:37:40.915 --> 01:37:45.318]  You're not going to stop drinking sodium fluoride in your water and food.
[01:37:45.338 --> 01:37:48.820]  And you're not going to stop drinking Diet Coke with aspartame.
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:50.801]  You're going to keep feeding your kids GMO food.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:38:11.145]  Diabetes is going to go up 3,000% and from 1 in 33 having cancer to 1 in 3, that's now happened and it's just all going to happen and they've built the FEMA camps, they're building more prisons and a lot of the college graduates are being integrated into this and they're hiring Tattletail squads everywhere and it's just all happening.
[01:38:12.585 --> 01:38:13.485]  It's just all happening.
[01:38:14.286 --> 01:38:18.787]  And you're going to go to your graves loving the New World Order, loving it, thinking you're the good guys.
[01:38:20.370 --> 01:38:29.193]  Because they used high-tech brainwashing techniques on you, incrementally, they used peer pressure, they used groupthink on you, and just like the general public.
[01:38:29.753 --> 01:38:30.654]  And I'm sorry!
[01:38:33.094 --> 01:38:41.637]  Now, there have been people that laughed at me, and they go get their child a third round of shots, and they have a convulsion in the hospital, or at the clinic, or on the way home, and then you wake up.
[01:38:43.218 --> 01:38:45.118]  I told you Rush Limbaugh would endorse Hillary.
[01:38:45.358 --> 01:38:45.759]  It happened.
[01:38:47.079 --> 01:38:49.820]  I told you everything that was going to happen, because I understand the enemy.
[01:38:50.692 --> 01:38:52.413]  And I will not support Hillary Clinton.
[01:38:52.473 --> 01:38:54.154]  I don't care if you call me a communist.
[01:38:55.014 --> 01:38:56.915]  You are the communist when you support her.
[01:38:57.035 --> 01:38:58.736]  I will not be part of this lie.
[01:39:03.158 --> 01:39:05.999]  And there's so many people come on our message board at Infowars.com.
[01:39:06.019 --> 01:39:07.340]  They admit they're CENTCOM.
[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:09.741]  They even brag that they're from the military.
[01:39:09.781 --> 01:39:14.843]  The government admits they have tens of thousands of troops on the message boards, quote, fighting propaganda in America.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.582]  The troops are already there, spying on peace groups, working with police.
[01:39:20.202 --> 01:39:22.943]  All illegal, all criminal, all un-American.
[01:39:32.308 --> 01:39:34.769]  It's just incredible that all of this is happening.
[01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:38.511]  And I'm frustrated.
[01:39:38.531 --> 01:39:39.872]  You know why I normally blow up on air?
[01:39:40.072 --> 01:39:41.753]  It's because I can't get to everything.
[01:39:41.953 --> 01:39:44.154]  You noticed I was sounding a little bit irritated during an interview.
[01:39:44.174 --> 01:39:45.555]  It wasn't with Butcher, the guest.
[01:39:45.795 --> 01:39:46.355]  I'm mad.
[01:39:46.535 --> 01:39:48.156]  I have a stack of news here.
[01:39:48.676 --> 01:39:50.917]  I have about an hour of audio clips I want to play.
[01:39:51.017 --> 01:39:52.618]  I have Larry B. Craft coming on.
[01:39:53.879 --> 01:39:58.000]  I want to warn you about Patriot scams and mythology and bull.
[01:40:01.862 --> 01:40:03.463]  It is such a responsibility.
[01:40:05.214 --> 01:40:11.435]  You know, you'd think it would make me happy to have Willie Nelson on or Charlie Sheen or have other Hollywood people or rock stars call me.
[01:40:12.156 --> 01:40:16.777]  I mean, I've had 20, 30 times the calls from high-profile people than what you've heard on air.
[01:40:18.377 --> 01:40:22.218]  And it kind of, it's fun at the moment, but later it's not.
[01:40:22.298 --> 01:40:26.559]  It's almost depressing because then I realize that I'm as big as it gets and I'm not that big.
[01:40:27.339 --> 01:40:31.700]  And that I've got this incredible responsibility and half the time I'm bumbling and gibbering on air.
[01:40:34.415 --> 01:40:36.576]  And I just wish I could wake people up in government.
[01:40:36.616 --> 01:40:37.797]  I wish I could get to them.
[01:40:37.857 --> 01:40:39.718]  I WISH I COULD TELL THEM WHAT'S HAPPENING!
[01:40:40.699 --> 01:40:41.880]  THIS STUFF'S REAL!
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:50.245]  I mean... Hundreds and hundreds, depending on the study.
[01:40:50.665 --> 01:40:53.687]  Some show thousands of percentage points, but on average it's hundreds of times.
[01:40:54.147 --> 01:40:58.310]  You know, a five-time increase, that's... five hundred percent.
[01:41:00.651 --> 01:41:03.213]  When you use a cell phone more than an hour a day,
[01:41:04.315 --> 01:41:05.075]  For ten years.
[01:41:07.957 --> 01:41:10.858]  A five-fold increase in brain tumors.
[01:41:13.259 --> 01:41:17.901]  The cell phone every minute is transmitting back to the tower for its GPS coordinate grid to track you.
[01:41:18.641 --> 01:41:20.362]  Told you that six years before it was in the news.
[01:41:21.282 --> 01:41:22.923]  All federal documents, not like I'm smart.
[01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:24.483]  I just know how to read what they're going to do.
[01:41:24.864 --> 01:41:25.324]  From them.
[01:41:27.245 --> 01:41:29.746]  You stick that in your pocket, it's frying your genitals.
[01:41:33.431 --> 01:41:35.452]  American, as respected as it gets.
[01:41:35.652 --> 01:41:37.953]  I already told you that 50,000 times.
[01:41:39.374 --> 01:41:41.935]  And I'm so weak that I've cut back on cell phone use by 95%.
[01:41:42.335 --> 01:41:44.236]  I should completely get rid of it.
[01:41:44.996 --> 01:41:46.497]  But I multitask when I'm driving.
[01:41:46.757 --> 01:41:49.639]  We commute 30 minutes, 45 minutes.
[01:41:50.679 --> 01:41:51.700]  I'm working all the time.
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:52.520]  What am I supposed to do?
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:53.961]  I try to use hands-free, lose it.
[01:41:54.761 --> 01:41:56.842]  Still, if you got it by your leg, it's still cooking you.
[01:41:58.483 --> 01:42:00.944]  I want you to do well, government people.
[01:42:01.610 --> 01:42:10.014]  But they're setting up a society where all you're going to be able to have is government jobs, or be fed on by the government, and you're in the wrong, and there's no way to say you're not.
[01:42:10.034 --> 01:42:13.115]  I mean, look at this.
[01:42:14.276 --> 01:42:17.817]  Police swabbing mouths during traffic stops in Serial Killer Hunt.
[01:42:22.319 --> 01:42:25.061]  And it just says at traffic stops, they just walk over.
[01:42:26.421 --> 01:42:28.282]  No judge, no jury, no warrant.
[01:42:28.702 --> 01:42:30.423]  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:42:32.483 --> 01:42:37.124]  And they say they're going to continue, even if it takes years, until they find him, as if he just won't move.
[01:42:38.924 --> 01:42:43.505]  Well, now they're nationally proposing, well, we'll have a serial killer database, and we'll just swab everybody.
[01:42:44.186 --> 01:42:45.366]  And, I mean, it's going to happen.
[01:42:45.386 --> 01:42:46.186]  They're going to pull you over.
[01:42:46.666 --> 01:42:48.747]  License, driver's license, everything.
[01:42:48.787 --> 01:42:53.788]  People are going to say they saw a brown-haired, blue-eyed guy ten years previous.
[01:42:53.808 --> 01:42:54.748]  They're going to have to do that.
[01:42:55.828 --> 01:42:59.169]  You got light brown hair, blue eyes, get out, I'm going to swab you.
[01:42:59.713 --> 01:43:02.875]  And you're gonna have to let that cop stick his hand in your mouth!
[01:43:03.056 --> 01:43:04.277]  The humiliation!
[01:43:04.297 --> 01:43:05.317]  The patheticness!
[01:43:05.678 --> 01:43:06.838]  What we've fallen to!
[01:43:07.179 --> 01:43:08.920]  THAT ISN'T AMERICA!
[01:43:09.601 --> 01:43:11.482]  We had serial killers before.
[01:43:12.583 --> 01:43:14.124]  We didn't need this type of thing.
[01:43:15.652 --> 01:43:17.313]  The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[01:43:17.654 --> 01:43:20.016]  Now those that set this up don't have good intentions.
[01:43:20.076 --> 01:43:28.403]  The idiots out there on the road who decided that they are God and that everything they do is for the greater good, they believe they're doing a good job.
[01:43:28.683 --> 01:43:30.545]  Let me give you a little news flash.
[01:43:31.846 --> 01:43:42.055]  If you are 34 years of age or younger, and you were born in a hospital in New Zealand, England, Canada, Australia, or the United States,
[01:43:43.001 --> 01:43:47.823]  You were put in an international slash federal blood database.
[01:43:50.164 --> 01:43:51.865]  I've had congressmen on.
[01:43:53.166 --> 01:43:56.027]  One, what, five years ago from Virginia who was fighting a Republican.
[01:43:56.307 --> 01:43:57.948]  I've had state reps on who discovered it.
[01:44:01.590 --> 01:44:04.751]  They, when you're born, take three ampules of blood.
[01:44:05.872 --> 01:44:08.433]  Three big old tubes full of it.
[01:44:09.854 --> 01:44:10.594]  Out of the little baby.
[01:44:13.504 --> 01:44:16.546]  And they tell you it's for a blood test at the health department.
[01:44:17.027 --> 01:44:21.370]  The health departments were set up by the eugenicists to carry out sterilization and control.
[01:44:21.610 --> 01:44:22.831]  They've always been wicked.
[01:44:23.571 --> 01:44:25.412]  And the health department does do the blood test.
[01:44:25.452 --> 01:44:26.613]  Why doesn't the hospital do it?
[01:44:26.633 --> 01:44:30.336]  All they do is take the blood and put it on a card, looking for several blood diseases.
[01:44:30.376 --> 01:44:31.176]  Why doesn't a hospital?
[01:44:31.737 --> 01:44:33.318]  Well, the government wants your blood.
[01:44:33.338 --> 01:44:33.918]  Just trust them.
[01:44:33.938 --> 01:44:36.320]  Well, turns out it goes in the DNA database.
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:37.621]  I've known that for 10 years.
[01:44:39.505 --> 01:44:44.709]  Remember hearing Patriots on the radio say it, but not giving sources, and then later, I saw it in the news ten years ago!
[01:44:44.769 --> 01:44:45.829]  It's actually admitted!
[01:44:48.511 --> 01:44:50.432]  They take your blood and they freeze-dry it.
[01:44:51.433 --> 01:44:53.775]  Now, they take one ampule, and they do test your blood.
[01:44:55.896 --> 01:45:01.600]  And then they take the other two ampules, and they mail them to federal and international databases.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.661]  They got my blood.
[01:45:02.821 --> 01:45:08.745]  I'm 33 years old, born in Parkland Hospital, Dallas, Texas, and they took my blood,
[01:45:09.577 --> 01:45:15.281]  And they sent it to the Dallas Health Department, and my blood is in the database.
[01:45:15.301 --> 01:45:16.102]  Now what does that mean?
[01:45:16.863 --> 01:45:20.766]  They can frame me any time they want.
[01:45:21.246 --> 01:45:24.669]  Notice how they've been selling you how DNA is 100% and how it's getting all these killers off?
[01:45:25.849 --> 01:45:27.691]  And how a third of the people on death row are innocent?
[01:45:29.973 --> 01:45:31.994]  They're not doing that because they're humanitarian.
[01:45:32.595 --> 01:45:36.658]  They're doing that because, and they're allowing that to be publicized.
[01:45:36.698 --> 01:45:38.299]  People who are humanitarian are pointing it out.
[01:45:39.372 --> 01:45:41.494]  So that we start thinking DNA is great.
[01:45:42.975 --> 01:45:46.597]  They can tailor a specific bio-weapon just according to your genetic makeup.
[01:45:47.178 --> 01:45:54.243]  They admit that big companies have been given access, biotech companies looking for certain compounds and genetic structures in your blood.
[01:45:57.425 --> 01:46:03.830]  They took your blood in a long-term strategic 34-year-old, or is it 35 now, program.
[01:46:08.513 --> 01:46:11.135]  You can see it started in seventy-two.
[01:46:13.077 --> 01:46:13.797]  Thirty-five.
[01:46:16.719 --> 01:46:17.660]  It's at thirty-six.
[01:46:18.961 --> 01:46:20.482]  Keeps coming in at thirty-four for years.
[01:46:21.703 --> 01:46:23.064]  When's the last time I looked up the numbers?
[01:46:23.745 --> 01:46:25.847]  That's your free society, Jack!
[01:46:28.729 --> 01:46:30.530]  And those cops are taking your sample.
[01:46:30.730 --> 01:46:34.553]  They're getting federal grants to set up their own little regional databases.
[01:46:36.235 --> 01:46:36.475]  You're
[01:46:37.942 --> 01:46:42.486]  Some of the largest and most easily removed cells in the body are on the inside of the cheek.
[01:46:45.048 --> 01:46:46.269]  And they're taking your cells.
[01:46:46.489 --> 01:46:47.670]  They're taking your body.
[01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:50.472]  They're seizing your body.
[01:46:51.693 --> 01:46:52.974]  Randomly at checkpoints.
[01:46:52.994 --> 01:46:56.616]  And I remember seeing, eight years ago, in Tucson, Arizona was the first place.
[01:46:56.657 --> 01:46:57.978]  Now it's in Colorado, everywhere else.
[01:46:58.238 --> 01:47:00.620]  Remember it was in the Denver Post a few months ago, six months ago?
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:03.682]  Huge checkpoints where they were randomly
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:05.461]  Taking blood.
[01:47:05.501 --> 01:47:06.981]  They had flashlights at night.
[01:47:07.562 --> 01:47:10.924]  See, now the cops are sticking things in you.
[01:47:10.964 --> 01:47:14.105]  Remember when they told the cops in 2002 to take the smallpox shots?
[01:47:14.205 --> 01:47:16.267]  And almost all of them, 99% L.A.
[01:47:16.287 --> 01:47:17.907]  Times reported, said no.
[01:47:18.968 --> 01:47:25.932]  They, in the same program, were training firefighters and locals how to round up the citizens and put us in sports stadiums for forced inoculations.
[01:47:27.737 --> 01:47:30.718]  But they had to suspend the program because the cops themselves.
[01:47:31.238 --> 01:47:35.020]  And by the way, police, they stick GPS in your cruiser first, don't they?
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:37.361]  They stick it in the city buses first.
[01:47:37.381 --> 01:47:39.682]  They make you go through what we go through later.
[01:47:39.962 --> 01:47:41.842]  So you'll think, well I had to do it, why shouldn't you?
[01:47:42.183 --> 01:47:44.483]  You're gonna get forcibly injected too, buddy.
[01:47:45.424 --> 01:47:45.984]  You hear me?
[01:47:46.924 --> 01:47:47.225]  Lady?
[01:47:48.245 --> 01:47:48.905]  You hear me?
[01:47:50.286 --> 01:47:51.606]  And don't you laugh at me!
[01:47:51.886 --> 01:47:53.987]  You've heard everything I say come true.
[01:47:54.007 --> 01:47:56.068]  This isn't a joke!
[01:47:58.283 --> 01:48:00.264]  These are wicked killers running things!
[01:48:04.186 --> 01:48:07.748]  So the cop thinks he's looking for a serial killer and it's going back into a federal database.
[01:48:09.289 --> 01:48:09.789]  Here's another one.
[01:48:09.869 --> 01:48:14.072]  FBI deputizes private contractors with extraordinary powers including shoot to kill.
[01:48:14.092 --> 01:48:15.813]  It's got an alternate.
[01:48:16.873 --> 01:48:21.596]  Today more than 23,000 representatives of private industry are working quietly with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:48:21.876 --> 01:48:23.557]  The members of this rapidly growing group called
[01:48:24.401 --> 01:48:28.443]  InfraGard receives secret warnings of terrorist threats before the public does.
[01:48:29.123 --> 01:48:30.204]  See, it's secret intelligence.
[01:48:30.224 --> 01:48:31.284]  That's intelligence operatives.
[01:48:31.865 --> 01:48:41.169]  And on at least one occasion before elected officials in return to provide information to the government, which alarms the ACLU, but they may be more to it than that.
[01:48:41.289 --> 01:48:47.652]  One business executive who showed me his InfraGard card told me they had permission to shoot to kill in the event of martial law.
[01:48:49.139 --> 01:48:51.501]  See, they've quietly recruited 26,000 preachers.
[01:48:51.521 --> 01:48:52.221]  That's now admitted.
[01:48:52.561 --> 01:48:54.803]  They've quietly recruited 400,000 truck drivers.
[01:48:55.123 --> 01:48:57.385]  They've quietly recruited 23,000 execs.
[01:48:58.425 --> 01:49:02.628]  They've put CIA over the threat integration centers.
[01:49:02.668 --> 01:49:05.450]  You know them as emergency management centers.
[01:49:05.490 --> 01:49:09.513]  And 10% of the college graduates the last four years running have degrees in all of this.
[01:49:10.674 --> 01:49:16.458]  Doesn't matter if a terrorist is rarer than a unicorn or a leprechaun or the tooth fairy.
[01:49:17.925 --> 01:49:20.747]  They're going to sing them everywhere, and you're the terrorist under U.S.
[01:49:20.787 --> 01:49:22.808]  Code, Section 802, U.S.A.
[01:49:22.848 --> 01:49:23.508]  Patriot Act.
[01:49:24.408 --> 01:49:25.569]  Hell is being released!
[01:49:27.570 --> 01:49:32.512]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:49:32.833 --> 01:49:34.714]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:49:34.914 --> 01:49:37.955]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:49:38.135 --> 01:49:41.277]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:49:41.577 --> 01:49:43.418]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[01:49:43.698 --> 01:49:47.399]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:50.341]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:49:50.961 --> 01:49:55.243]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:49:55.463 --> 01:49:59.524]  But first know this, that prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:49:59.924 --> 01:50:04.246]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[01:50:04.526 --> 01:50:04.726]  I think so.
[01:50:27.503 --> 01:50:29.124]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:50:29.505 --> 01:50:32.967]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:50:33.127 --> 01:50:34.989]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:50:35.009 --> 01:50:38.331]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:50:38.652 --> 01:50:44.156]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:50:44.436 --> 01:50:48.439]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:49.220]  In the info,
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:53.641]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:50:53.921 --> 01:50:56.702]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:51:22.074 --> 01:51:23.896]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[01:51:24.216 --> 01:51:25.658]  Bring down the New World Order.
[01:51:26.038 --> 01:51:26.759]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:51:28.169 --> 01:51:33.651]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:51:34.071 --> 01:51:38.312]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:51:38.732 --> 01:51:45.594]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:51:46.034 --> 01:51:52.738]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:51:53.058 --> 01:51:54.679]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:51:54.979 --> 01:51:58.161]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:51:58.422 --> 01:52:00.883]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:52:01.203 --> 01:52:07.967]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:52:08.387 --> 01:52:11.089]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:52:11.329 --> 01:52:14.191]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free.
[01:52:14.471 --> 01:52:14.691]  At 866-885-6625.
[01:52:14.731 --> 01:52:15.092]  That's 866-885-6625.
[01:52:15.132 --> 01:52:16.773]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:52:16.793 --> 01:52:22.157]  The CIA, the FBI, Defense Intelligence, the Marine Corps have been operating since 1988 secretly in every major city.
[01:52:47.043 --> 01:52:49.784]  They've been merging the military and police covertly.
[01:52:51.404 --> 01:52:54.625]  First with small cadres of select officers, now expanding.
[01:52:56.846 --> 01:53:02.788]  Again, we've had FBI, while they're with the military searching a bus as part of a drill, come up and give us these documents.
[01:53:04.148 --> 01:53:06.009]  But here it is, you know their website.
[01:53:07.779 --> 01:53:09.001]  Then the FBI cloned it.
[01:53:09.281 --> 01:53:14.267]  InfraGard started in Cleveland back in 96 when the private sector there cooperated with the FBI to investigate cyber threats.
[01:53:14.768 --> 01:53:22.458]  That says Phyllis Shinnick, Chairman of the Board of Directors of InfraGard National Members Alliance, and the prime member behind the growth of InfraGard over the last several years.
[01:53:22.478 --> 01:53:24.220]  See, it started a long time ago, folks.
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:27.981]  Then the FBI cloned it.
[01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:35.022]  InfraGard itself is still an FBI operation with FBI agents in each state overseeing the local InfraGard chapters.
[01:53:35.482 --> 01:53:36.723]  There are now 86 of them.
[01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:40.444]  The Alliance is a non-profit organization of private sector InfraGard members.
[01:53:41.024 --> 01:53:43.984]  We are the owners, operators, and experts of our critical infrastructure.
[01:53:44.344 --> 01:53:54.987]  See, I saw Ridge on C-SPAN for two hours in 2002, the head of Homeland Security, before it even got federal funding, saying, you're going to have an ID to buy and sell, an ID to have a job.
[01:53:55.618 --> 01:54:00.120]  An ID to buy beer, cigarettes, cold medicine at first, then a national sales tax.
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.521]  I sat there watching it with my mouth open.
[01:54:04.281 --> 01:54:07.002]  I believe I taped it, but I would just tape thousands of tapes.
[01:54:07.383 --> 01:54:07.643]  I don't know.
[01:54:07.663 --> 01:54:08.103]  It doesn't matter.
[01:54:08.123 --> 01:54:08.883]  It's all happening now.
[01:54:10.564 --> 01:54:11.644]  And it just gets worse here.
[01:54:12.524 --> 01:54:17.686]  At its most basic level, InfraGard is a partnership between the FBI and the private sector.
[01:54:17.726 --> 01:54:21.868]  The InfraGard website states, InfraGard chapters are geolinked with the FBI field territories.
[01:54:22.668 --> 01:54:25.430]  In November 2001, InfraGard had 1,700 members.
[01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:29.633]  As of late January, InfraGard had 23,682 members.
[01:54:30.154 --> 01:54:31.515]  And they intend to bring it up to over 100,000.
[01:54:32.816 --> 01:54:36.959]  Just like it's 460-something-thousand truck drivers spy on everybody.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:40.622]  They said it was for post-9-11, but they also quote, fight crime.
[01:54:41.523 --> 01:54:45.185]  And they're enrolled.
[01:54:45.265 --> 01:54:48.908]  To join, each person must be sponsored by an existing InfraGard member.
[01:54:48.948 --> 01:54:49.729]  It's like the Mafia.
[01:54:50.385 --> 01:54:51.486]  Or a partnered organization.
[01:54:51.526 --> 01:54:53.987]  The FBI then vets the applicant on the application form.
[01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:59.870]  Prospective members are asked which aspect of the critical infrastructure the organization deals with.
[01:55:02.612 --> 01:55:07.415]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on and on from there.
[01:55:08.335 --> 01:55:11.637]  A total control grid being put in place.
[01:55:12.317 --> 01:55:15.219]  We need a story on this to expand and tie it into the preachers.
[01:55:15.599 --> 01:55:16.580]  See, people write articles
[01:55:19.025 --> 01:55:20.846]  This was originally written by the Progressive Magazine.
[01:55:22.106 --> 01:55:23.526]  And we write a piece here, a piece there.
[01:55:23.546 --> 01:55:34.030]  We need an article that goes through the cell phone tracking, the face scanning, the preachers being recruited, the truck drivers being recruited, the microphones going up, the cameras in the school bathrooms.
[01:55:34.650 --> 01:55:38.471]  I mean, this is oral on steroids, and the illegals exempt from all of it.
[01:55:39.931 --> 01:55:41.472]  You've got to love slavery.
[01:55:41.852 --> 01:55:47.954]  Because again, we're the fat, dumb hogs that believe anything and go for anything and love slavery.
[01:55:49.068 --> 01:55:57.353]  And they want this police state because they want to be able to suppress you when they're taking your pension funds, taking your farms, taking your ranches, all you fools who are serving this.
[01:55:58.073 --> 01:56:00.975]  There are cops listening who are going to have their parents have their stuff stolen.
[01:56:02.515 --> 01:56:03.756]  You're going to have euthanasia.
[01:56:03.816 --> 01:56:04.977]  You're going to have it all.
[01:56:05.197 --> 01:56:08.539]  Man, this is the greatest evil we've ever seen.
[01:56:08.599 --> 01:56:10.300]  And don't think your preachers are going to tell you.
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:12.461]  The Antichrist could stand up.
[01:56:12.501 --> 01:56:13.842]  He'll just buy off your preachers.
[01:56:13.862 --> 01:56:16.083]  They're already saying you've got to submit to whoever runs the government.
[01:56:16.826 --> 01:56:19.349]  For those of you who believe in God, can't you see what's happening?
[01:56:19.869 --> 01:56:21.151]  Can't you see anything?
[01:56:24.474 --> 01:56:31.962]  In closing, I want you to get Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:56:32.482 --> 01:56:33.423]  Buy the DVD.
[01:56:34.044 --> 01:56:34.905]  Make copies of it.
[01:56:35.445 --> 01:56:36.286]  Get it out to people.
[01:56:36.346 --> 01:56:37.968]  Check out all the claims we make in the film.
[01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:44.212]  Let's say you're a government bureaucrat, CPS worker, you don't care, you're just worried about yourself.
[01:56:44.752 --> 01:56:45.793]  Why don't you go to Google Video?
[01:56:45.813 --> 01:56:47.313]  You can watch Endgame for free.
[01:56:48.154 --> 01:56:50.575]  Just type Endgame and Alex Jones into Google, you can watch it for free.
[01:56:50.595 --> 01:56:57.838]  If I was going to spend 2 hours 20 minutes though, I'd go to PrisonPlanet.tv and pay 15 cents and watch it in super high quality.
[01:56:58.738 --> 01:57:01.839]  Just get Endgame and find out you're in the crosshairs too!
[01:57:05.963 --> 01:57:07.804]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:57:08.105 --> 01:57:19.813]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:20.033 --> 01:57:20.693]  Big Brother.
[01:57:21.354 --> 01:57:22.414]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:23.115 --> 01:57:24.256]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:24.876 --> 01:57:25.697]  You want answers?
[01:57:26.457 --> 01:57:27.398]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:28.018 --> 01:57:31.881]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:32.201 --> 01:57:34.563]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:57:35.433 --> 01:57:36.293]  Alex Jones.
[01:57:41.296 --> 01:57:45.757]  We're now into the third hour on this seventh day of February 2008.
[01:57:46.698 --> 01:57:50.019]  Larry Nichols worked for the CIA and Black Ops overthrowing nations.
[01:57:50.039 --> 01:57:52.600]  We're going to talk some about that before he leaves us.
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:53.261]  Very interesting.
[01:57:54.261 --> 01:57:59.403]  We're talking about the Clintons, their crimes, who they work for, the activities they're going to carry out.
[01:58:00.344 --> 01:58:03.645]  Larry, so many conservatives were against Clinton.
[01:58:04.952 --> 01:58:06.433]  And they were against everything communist.
[01:58:06.533 --> 01:58:08.113]  Now they're not worried about communists.
[01:58:08.213 --> 01:58:12.255]  They're worried about the Muslim extremists, which we all know our government runs and controls.
[01:58:13.816 --> 01:58:18.098]  And so many conservatives now are emailing me, calling me, saying, look, I don't care.
[01:58:18.158 --> 01:58:18.918]  I support Hillary.
[01:58:20.630 --> 01:58:25.033]  A bunch of national talk show hosts, Republicans, have been endorsing Hillary.
[01:58:25.933 --> 01:58:30.716]  We've had Ann Coulter saying she's for Hillary, quote, she's our girl.
[01:58:31.196 --> 01:58:35.439]  It's come out that Fox News has covertly been raising money for and advising her.
[01:58:35.479 --> 01:58:38.440]  The White House, they admit, has quote, been helping write her speeches.
[01:58:39.121 --> 01:58:40.882]  Told people about this years ago, now it's out.
[01:58:41.282 --> 01:58:44.264]  We know they're intelligence operatives at a level way above what you were at.
[01:58:45.044 --> 01:58:46.405]  We know that's why they recruited you.
[01:58:47.726 --> 01:58:50.107]  And then you saw their narcotics trafficking and wouldn't go along with it.
[01:58:50.968 --> 01:58:52.248]  What do you say to Ann Coulter?
[01:58:52.288 --> 01:58:58.230]  What do you say to all these big former neocons who are now saying, we support Clinton?
[01:58:58.630 --> 01:59:00.511]  I mean, that shows you that she's going to be president.
[01:59:00.851 --> 01:59:05.892]  They're now all bowing down to her, and it shows the fix was in as soon as she got into the Senate.
[01:59:06.853 --> 01:59:12.794]  I mean, what do you say to those mainline conservatives right now that are starting to support Hillary?
[01:59:13.715 --> 01:59:14.415]  Who's your Alex?
[01:59:17.055 --> 01:59:18.576]  What makes us believe?
[01:59:20.566 --> 01:59:21.947]  That there have been two parties.
[01:59:26.048 --> 01:59:26.229]  What?
[01:59:26.869 --> 01:59:29.110]  I know there hasn't been since they blew Kennedy's head off in 1963.
[01:59:29.150 --> 01:59:29.390]  Yeah.
[01:59:31.771 --> 01:59:34.592]  I mean, these people are going to do what they're told to do.
[01:59:34.672 --> 01:59:36.953]  Look at, look at Bill O'Reilly.
[01:59:37.654 --> 01:59:40.515]  Man, when I met Bill O'Reilly, he was with hard copy.
[01:59:41.935 --> 01:59:43.056]  Now he's this
[01:59:43.979 --> 01:59:51.323]  Immediate Bill O'Reilly knows no more about the news or what's going on than my English Bulldog.
[01:59:54.405 --> 01:59:56.766]  But the problem, folks, is this.
[01:59:58.487 --> 01:59:59.487]  We're under invasion.
[01:59:59.507 --> 02:00:01.248]  We're under full invasion.
[02:00:01.568 --> 02:00:03.770]  Now, you don't believe me.
[02:00:03.810 --> 02:00:05.451]  Let me give you a test.
[02:00:05.551 --> 02:00:07.612]  Now, I'm sorry, Alex, about my voice.
[02:00:07.712 --> 02:00:10.173]  I just spent a week on a slab in the hospital.
[02:00:11.394 --> 02:00:12.134]  And I just got out.
[02:00:14.778 --> 02:00:16.059]  I want y'all to take a test.
[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:23.223]  Open your front door, get in your car, and drive.
[02:00:24.824 --> 02:00:28.766]  Drive by buildings that used to be big plants where Americans worked.
[02:00:30.347 --> 02:00:33.709]  Drive by construction sites where Americans used to lay bricks.
[02:00:34.050 --> 02:00:35.250]  All you see is illegal aliens.
[02:00:35.791 --> 02:00:37.552]  And all you see is illegal aliens.
[02:00:38.032 --> 02:00:39.353]  It's way more than 30 million.
[02:00:40.293 --> 02:00:40.654]  Yeah.
[02:00:41.094 --> 02:00:41.394]  Yeah.
[02:00:42.835 --> 02:00:44.456]  There's that many in California.
[02:00:46.892 --> 02:00:48.274]  Y'all, we're under invasion.
[02:00:48.654 --> 02:00:52.538]  And once they get here, where are we going to go?
[02:00:53.079 --> 02:00:54.220]  What are you going to do?
[02:00:55.301 --> 02:01:04.532]  And once you lose your family, once you lose your money, once you lose your ability to live, you become a puppet.
[02:01:05.071 --> 02:01:07.051]  Look, all you have to do is go to Nicaragua
[02:01:35.529 --> 02:01:37.129]  I asked Adolfo Calero once.
[02:01:37.149 --> 02:01:38.230]  I was in Managua.
[02:01:39.330 --> 02:01:40.670]  Excuse me.
[02:01:40.830 --> 02:01:42.471]  Here were these beautiful buildings.
[02:01:44.671 --> 02:01:47.392]  And they were all covered in vines and just destroyed.
[02:01:48.292 --> 02:01:49.252]  I said, how'd that happen?
[02:01:49.272 --> 02:01:50.372]  He said, it happened overnight.
[02:01:51.573 --> 02:01:51.973]  Stay there.
[02:01:52.033 --> 02:01:53.233]  I want to hear about that.
[02:01:53.253 --> 02:01:57.594]  I want to hear about how to beat the Clintons, beat the New World Order, from your perspective, Larry Nichols.
[02:01:58.374 --> 02:02:02.055]  And then I want to get in to talk to Doc Mendenegy, talking to
[02:02:04.719 --> 02:02:09.228]  Al Maliki and a lot more on the other side with Larry Nichols.
[02:02:09.288 --> 02:02:10.771]  Very important interview ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:11.412 --> 02:02:11.833]  Stay with us.

[02:03:17.659 --> 02:03:21.100]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:23.160]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:26.481]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:03:26.801 --> 02:03:32.303]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:03:32.583 --> 02:03:36.524]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:04:14.158 --> 02:04:14.999]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:04:16.135 --> 02:04:21.618]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:04:22.058 --> 02:04:26.280]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:33.563]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:04:34.003 --> 02:04:40.710]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:42.651]  There are no reported side effects.

[02:05:16.866 --> 02:05:22.888]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:23.509 --> 02:05:26.530]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:31.992]  All right, Larry Nichols, I want to start moving quickly with you now.
[02:05:32.552 --> 02:05:35.133]  You were finishing up when you were talking to one of the leaders down there.
[02:05:35.153 --> 02:05:38.214]  I believe you were talking about Nicaragua.
[02:05:38.274 --> 02:05:39.015]  Please continue.
[02:05:39.715 --> 02:05:42.036]  I mean, he said it happened overnight.
[02:05:43.521 --> 02:05:52.004]  One minute it was just a peaceful community, the next minute Sandinistas came in, took over, and it became a puppet state.
[02:05:53.984 --> 02:05:55.565]  Now folks, listen to me.
[02:05:56.445 --> 02:06:03.227]  If we don't talk about anything else the rest of the day... Alex, I'm counting on you.
[02:06:04.628 --> 02:06:05.728]  I'm counting on you, son.
[02:06:08.309 --> 02:06:09.149]  Hillary's mine.
[02:06:10.416 --> 02:06:13.419]  Ain't nobody can stop Hillary from being president but me.
[02:06:13.459 --> 02:06:14.860]  Nobody has the documents.
[02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:16.081]  Nobody has the evidence.
[02:06:16.842 --> 02:06:17.302]  I got it.
[02:06:18.744 --> 02:06:20.605]  She's either got to go over me or through me.
[02:06:22.747 --> 02:06:24.049]  That ain't gonna save the country.
[02:06:25.630 --> 02:06:29.133]  There's one thing you can do and save the country tomorrow.
[02:06:30.254 --> 02:06:32.076]  Save it tomorrow.
[02:06:32.997 --> 02:06:33.878]  And we proved it.
[02:06:33.978 --> 02:06:35.179]  You have proven it.
[02:06:36.351 --> 02:06:41.813]  When Bush was president and the Republicans were in control of both houses, they were just like little Indians.
[02:06:41.914 --> 02:06:44.054]  Whatever Bush wanted, they just marched in a row.
[02:06:45.895 --> 02:06:53.199]  It took just a little bit of a balance of power of the Democrats to take away from the Republicans.
[02:06:54.679 --> 02:07:01.442]  And you learned, Alex, the key to this nation, the key that our forefathers gave us.
[02:07:02.403 --> 02:07:02.923]  You hear me?
[02:07:04.016 --> 02:07:06.758]  Our forefathers, they're the ones that taught us what to do.
[02:07:08.719 --> 02:07:12.302]  We need citizen legislators.
[02:07:13.643 --> 02:07:15.464]  Folks, there's never been a time.
[02:07:16.224 --> 02:07:17.565]  You know, how did I beat Clinton?
[02:07:17.745 --> 02:07:20.667]  There was no way to beat Clinton, because I mean, he had control of everything.
[02:07:20.948 --> 02:07:28.793]  But I picked my time, I picked women, of all things, to attack Bill Clinton with, which you really thought was the craziest thing on Earth.
[02:07:30.634 --> 02:07:33.196]  Right now, the American people
[02:07:34.673 --> 02:07:37.695]  Do not want Republican or Democrat.
[02:07:38.095 --> 02:07:39.176]  They're fed up with both.
[02:07:41.257 --> 02:07:46.801]  If y'all will get out and get on the ballot, don't buy yard signs.
[02:07:48.642 --> 02:07:50.343]  Don't buy ads on TV.
[02:07:50.663 --> 02:07:52.945]  Don't go up and down your street advertising.
[02:07:54.586 --> 02:08:03.091]  Just get whatever you gotta do to get your name on the ballot from dog catcher to Congressman to Senator.
[02:08:04.901 --> 02:08:05.722]  As an independent.
[02:08:07.763 --> 02:08:12.385]  Then what happens, Alex, is Hillary has no power.
[02:08:13.686 --> 02:08:14.647]  She has no power.
[02:08:16.728 --> 02:08:20.910]  Because we have citizen legislators there to block her.
[02:08:22.471 --> 02:08:28.495]  The problem is, Larry, and they still have the electronic, you know, fraudulent machines everywhere, but about 40% of the country now,
[02:08:29.215 --> 02:08:31.156]  I have rigged more voting machines than most people have ever seen.
[02:08:31.176 --> 02:08:32.716]  I will teach you how to beat that.
[02:08:32.736 --> 02:08:33.536]  You don't have to do anything.
[02:08:33.576 --> 02:08:34.356]  All you gotta do is go blow.
[02:08:58.524 --> 02:08:59.144]  On the ballot.
[02:09:00.164 --> 02:09:02.125]  And one's Republican, one's Democrat.
[02:09:02.605 --> 02:09:04.145]  And then here's this guy, Joe Blow.
[02:09:04.165 --> 02:09:07.166]  And people say, well, what do you stand for, Joe Blow?
[02:09:07.306 --> 02:09:08.026]  Don't tell them.
[02:09:09.547 --> 02:09:10.207]  Don't tell them.
[02:09:10.227 --> 02:09:13.508]  Because if you tell them, Alex, you're in 40-40-20.
[02:09:13.528 --> 02:09:17.889]  40-40-20 means if somebody, if you like this, somebody hates it.
[02:09:18.929 --> 02:09:19.829]  So you don't tell them.
[02:09:21.150 --> 02:09:26.011]  What difference, Alex, would it make if Al Capone were in Congress?
[02:09:26.829 --> 02:09:29.791]  What in God's name could he do any more to this country?
[02:09:30.031 --> 02:09:31.572]  Well, Larry, let's expand on that.
[02:09:32.093 --> 02:09:37.156]  I think the key here is, as you said, continue to expose how they're getting rid of our sovereignty, North American Union.
[02:09:37.516 --> 02:09:40.098]  This is the end days for this country if we don't turn it around now.
[02:09:41.078 --> 02:09:43.280]  Look at the army you've got.
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:45.982]  You've got people that drive nails.
[02:09:46.062 --> 02:09:47.423]  They're not driving nails.
[02:09:47.983 --> 02:09:50.625]  Look what happened in this election.
[02:09:51.065 --> 02:09:55.448]  This election that you just saw is proof that what I'm telling you will work.
[02:09:56.368 --> 02:10:00.519]  People will show up if they think they can win.
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:04.931]  Yeah, you're talking about the 2006 election where they put Democrats in wanting change.
[02:10:05.788 --> 02:10:05.988]  Yeah.
[02:10:06.268 --> 02:10:08.550]  And they didn't get it, so now you think they're going to go for independent.
[02:10:08.570 --> 02:10:08.990]  I agree.
[02:10:09.051 --> 02:10:12.333]  Ron Paul needs to soon run for independent.
[02:10:12.353 --> 02:10:14.254]  They're talking about him winning a brokered convention.
[02:10:14.535 --> 02:10:17.377]  How would he win a brokered convention when he's going to get less than 10% of the vote?
[02:10:17.397 --> 02:10:18.398]  He's not going to win it.
[02:10:18.598 --> 02:10:20.339]  It's not at the presidential level.
[02:10:20.419 --> 02:10:20.919]  I agree.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:28.605]  I've always said, why do we have 50-60% turnout at the national level, but then 8% on average at the local?
[02:10:28.685 --> 02:10:30.266]  I'll tell you what Ron Paul can do.
[02:10:31.487 --> 02:10:33.429]  Ron Paul can go around this nation
[02:10:34.031 --> 02:10:39.755]  And he can say, you, Mr. Farmer, you, Mr. Nail Driver, you, Mr. Roofer.
[02:10:39.895 --> 02:10:40.556]  He's been doing that.
[02:10:40.956 --> 02:10:42.977]  Get your name on the ballot.
[02:10:43.217 --> 02:10:43.938]  He's been doing that.
[02:10:45.179 --> 02:10:54.345]  And if we can get enough independents in Congress... There'll be so many independents running, they can't engage in fraud everywhere and fix it.
[02:10:54.786 --> 02:10:55.866]  They can't stop it.
[02:10:55.886 --> 02:10:56.467]  You got it.
[02:10:57.287 --> 02:10:57.568]  Alex?
[02:10:57.588 --> 02:11:02.371]  You're the only one with a voice big enough to do that, buddy.
[02:11:03.897 --> 02:11:09.200]  Oh, I mean, my show's pretty good size, but I mean, if the listeners move on ideas, it can certainly have an effect.
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:12.281]  And I think, out of a toolbox of things, that's certainly there.
[02:11:12.541 --> 02:11:14.342]  But also, what you did on Talk Radio,
[02:11:15.014 --> 02:11:15.674]  Hey, you let them mess with me.
[02:11:15.694 --> 02:11:16.114]  You know, I've known
[02:11:45.288 --> 02:11:45.408]  No.
[02:11:45.488 --> 02:11:45.628]  No.
[02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:11.931]  Should at least be interviewed when they're interviewing anybody that might have ever known a shoe they ever wore?
[02:12:12.231 --> 02:12:14.872]  But like you said, the establishment fixes in.
[02:12:14.892 --> 02:12:20.733]  We're going to have you back for a second interview, Larry, but in the time we've got left, I want to switch gears over into the cable cutting.
[02:12:21.073 --> 02:12:22.253]  Now it is six cables.
[02:12:23.193 --> 02:12:26.374]  The open buildup of troops, open discussions of attacking Iran.
[02:12:27.094 --> 02:12:29.634]  You've talked to the Iranian leader.
[02:12:29.674 --> 02:12:30.995]  You've talked to the Iraqi leader.
[02:12:31.835 --> 02:12:33.335]  Let's talk about talking
[02:12:34.293 --> 02:12:38.697]  You have these sources going back to the Mujahideen and your CIA operations there, Larry.
[02:12:39.157 --> 02:12:43.481]  Let's go back here first and talk about your discussions with Al-Maliki.
[02:12:45.002 --> 02:12:52.328]  Maliki is ready with a government that they have already formed, that is set up.
[02:12:52.368 --> 02:12:59.294]  You see, they were running under, until the 16th of last month, what's called the Burma Provisional Government.
[02:13:00.655 --> 02:13:02.997]  Our government gave them all these benchmarks to hit.
[02:13:04.048 --> 02:13:05.869]  Yeah, but do you know what the little trick was?
[02:13:07.150 --> 02:13:07.470]  Tell me.
[02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:09.732]  They rigged it to where they couldn't hit any of them.
[02:13:10.973 --> 02:13:13.874]  Well, they want to stay there to keep the oil from flowing to keep prices up.
[02:13:14.075 --> 02:13:14.335]  Right.
[02:13:14.535 --> 02:13:17.297]  Now, Maliki is autonomous.
[02:13:18.718 --> 02:13:22.300]  Iraq now is an autonomous nation.
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:25.462]  Yeah, their puppet ceased to be a puppet, what, six months ago.
[02:13:25.502 --> 02:13:26.503]  He said, I want you to leave.
[02:13:27.203 --> 02:13:29.525]  And he told them, and remember what Bush said.
[02:13:29.565 --> 02:13:31.926]  Bush said, when y'all stand up, we'll stand down.
[02:13:32.146 --> 02:13:33.287]  Maliki stood up.
[02:13:33.857 --> 02:13:41.883]  He's standing up, but they're trying not to leave, and they're trying to start a kick fight between Iran.
[02:13:42.323 --> 02:13:48.087]  You know, they were saying that Iran was providing all of these weapons into Iraq, and I'm sitting here.
[02:13:48.107 --> 02:13:50.529]  I mean, I'm talking to them, Alex.
[02:13:50.809 --> 02:13:51.730]  I'm talking to them.
[02:13:52.370 --> 02:13:55.672]  And I go on the air, and I go, show them to me.
[02:13:58.194 --> 02:13:58.695]  Show us.
[02:13:59.255 --> 02:14:00.596]  Well, you notice they never showed us.
[02:14:02.515 --> 02:14:05.256]  They're trying to start a regional conflict.
[02:14:05.996 --> 02:14:11.998]  If you understand... Well, that's the old... Yeah, that's the 1983 Israeli plan that we've adopted.
[02:14:12.258 --> 02:14:22.282]  Break the place up, break each nation in three to four parts, sow sectarian violence against Shiites, Sunni, and the Kurds, and that's been the policy, and they've carried out the policy.
[02:14:22.322 --> 02:14:31.025]  If you understand the plan that's been around since I've been around, you control through chaos.
[02:14:31.661 --> 02:14:32.621]  Order through chaos.
[02:14:33.022 --> 02:14:33.202]  Yep.
[02:14:34.582 --> 02:14:42.606]  And so, that's why, unless we stop it, it ain't gonna end.
[02:14:42.886 --> 02:14:46.028]  And it's hard for black ops to build something, make something good.
[02:14:46.088 --> 02:14:48.088]  It's easy to destroy and get everybody killing each other.
[02:14:48.929 --> 02:14:50.229]  Oh yeah, I mean, my God.
[02:14:50.490 --> 02:14:51.330]  Let me ask you this.
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:56.921]  They were talking about insurgents and I'm sitting here going, what are you talking insurgents?
[02:14:56.981 --> 02:14:59.962]  And it turns out the government was funding all the sides and giving them weapons.
[02:15:00.082 --> 02:15:01.123]  Oh yeah, go figure.
[02:15:01.423 --> 02:15:07.264]  I mean, if the Sunnis hated the Shias and the Shias hated the Sunnis and they were fighting each other, right?
[02:15:08.144 --> 02:15:12.586]  Then why would you need an insurgent to come in and start a fight between them?
[02:15:12.786 --> 02:15:14.446]  They ought to do it automatically, right?
[02:15:14.746 --> 02:15:15.246]  Absolutely.
[02:15:15.266 --> 02:15:18.027]  It is ready.
[02:15:18.207 --> 02:15:18.967]  It's time.
[02:15:19.148 --> 02:15:20.708]  We have to stand up.
[02:15:21.232 --> 02:15:27.436]  We have to stand up through our people, through our voices, through our Congress, through Ron Paul.
[02:15:27.496 --> 02:15:30.578]  Folks, you have to put the maximum effort out.
[02:15:30.598 --> 02:15:32.579]  Tell us a little bit about the work you did in Afghanistan.
[02:15:33.399 --> 02:15:36.981]  And when you first, I mean, when was the first time you talked to Ahmadinejad?
[02:15:38.022 --> 02:15:44.186]  Well, I talked to him because they were negotiating a thing between Maliki.
[02:15:46.247 --> 02:15:47.928]  At that time, if you'll remember,
[02:15:49.231 --> 02:15:53.895]  America did not want Maliki to negotiate with Iran.
[02:15:56.076 --> 02:16:06.144]  And because I'm a Saladin, and I know Sistani, I was able to help set up a negotiation.
[02:16:07.785 --> 02:16:09.747]  When did you first get into Afghanistan?
[02:16:09.787 --> 02:16:10.507]  How long were you there?
[02:16:11.808 --> 02:16:14.410]  I was there, I guess what, maybe 84, 85?
[02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:18.980]  Six, maybe.
[02:16:19.501 --> 02:16:21.021]  Two years, whatever, two years.
[02:16:21.081 --> 02:16:21.782]  What were you doing?
[02:16:22.262 --> 02:16:23.002]  Killing Russians.
[02:16:26.764 --> 02:16:28.764]  Were you with the teams or were you bringing weapons in?
[02:16:30.045 --> 02:16:33.766]  Well, I mean, we would run weapons across Pakistan.
[02:16:33.987 --> 02:16:34.507]  On the mules?
[02:16:35.167 --> 02:16:41.970]  Yeah, into, you know, into the mountains in Afghanistan and then you just sit back and shot Russians until the Russians quit.
[02:16:45.011 --> 02:16:45.951]  I mean, it was fun.
[02:16:46.011 --> 02:16:47.272]  I mean, it was something to do.
[02:16:49.622 --> 02:16:59.430]  Stay there, I want to talk about when you talk to Al Maliki, when you talk to Ahmadinejad, and this is amazing information.
[02:16:59.470 --> 02:17:02.792]  People that find all this hard to believe, everything Larry Nichols has ever told me is checked out.
[02:17:04.334 --> 02:17:06.976]  This is the guy who they admit brought all the big scandals on Clinton.
[02:17:07.916 --> 02:17:10.458]  We'll be right back with Larry Nichols on the other side.
[02:17:10.478 --> 02:17:14.301]  Then I'm going to have Larry Wright shotgun with us when we have the veterans against McCain coming on.
[02:17:16.203 --> 02:17:17.504]  It is a big idea
[02:17:18.667 --> 02:17:21.349]  A new world order in the near future.
[02:17:22.170 --> 02:17:24.672]  Birth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:17:25.333 --> 02:17:27.095]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:17:28.135 --> 02:17:30.377]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[02:17:30.938 --> 02:17:33.380]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:17:34.121 --> 02:17:41.467]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:17:44.458 --> 02:17:49.442]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:17:49.942 --> 02:17:53.384]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:17:53.785 --> 02:17:56.266]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[02:17:56.326 --> 02:17:57.487]  Most people have no idea.
[02:17:57.527 --> 02:17:58.248]  They're not after money.
[02:17:58.268 --> 02:17:59.369]  They have all the money they need.
[02:17:59.569 --> 02:18:00.309]  They're after power.
[02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:01.570]  That's what they're after.

[02:18:21.244 --> 02:18:26.428]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:18:27.389 --> 02:18:40.499]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:46.703]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.

[02:21:00.826 --> 02:21:01.026]  That's 877-943-8600.
[02:21:01.046 --> 02:21:01.406]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[02:21:01.446 --> 02:21:02.767]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[02:21:02.807 --> 02:21:03.447]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[02:21:26.730 --> 02:21:32.493]  Larry Nichols, any websites, phone numbers, contact info you want to give out for other talk show hosts that might want to interview you?
[02:21:34.093 --> 02:21:37.555]  My number is 501-329-1159.
[02:21:38.115 --> 02:21:42.937]  Well, let's give that out at the end of the interview, because I would ask listeners to not just call you, because you might get a thousand phone calls.
[02:21:44.026 --> 02:21:47.387]  Let me explain to you about Iran.
[02:21:47.527 --> 02:21:48.307]  May I please?
[02:21:48.327 --> 02:21:49.507]  Go ahead.
[02:21:49.527 --> 02:21:50.948]  Because nobody does.
[02:21:52.648 --> 02:21:56.429]  A man like that, he's got nukes, folks.
[02:21:56.509 --> 02:21:57.229]  He's had them.
[02:21:57.689 --> 02:21:59.129]  He got them from Korea.
[02:21:59.289 --> 02:22:00.890]  He got them from China.
[02:22:01.330 --> 02:22:02.550]  He got them from Russia.
[02:22:03.450 --> 02:22:10.812]  He doesn't need nuclear plants to build plutonium rods to create nuclear weapons.
[02:22:11.425 --> 02:22:13.426]  You know what their problem is, Alex?
[02:22:14.866 --> 02:22:17.707]  Their oil is drying up into sludge.
[02:22:19.248 --> 02:22:20.388]  And they need the power.
[02:22:22.769 --> 02:22:23.510]  They need the power.
[02:22:23.610 --> 02:22:27.691]  Well, they are building peaceful plants that have nothing to do with uranium enrichment.
[02:22:27.711 --> 02:22:29.332]  I don't know if they have weapons, as you say.
[02:22:29.372 --> 02:22:32.933]  I know that our government helped give Pakistan the weapons.
[02:22:33.013 --> 02:22:33.793]  Why would the U.S.
[02:22:33.833 --> 02:22:35.094]  help Pakistan get nukes?
[02:22:36.074 --> 02:22:38.355]  Well, go figure.
[02:22:40.556 --> 02:22:40.736]  Look,
[02:22:42.145 --> 02:22:48.090]  We're, our job in the Middle East is to keep that place in turmoil.
[02:22:49.851 --> 02:22:58.978]  And as long as it's in turmoil, then there's one bunch that supposedly has the big stick that controls it all, which are the major oil companies.
[02:23:00.259 --> 02:23:05.944]  But let me tell you, Nary Al-Maliki ain't putting up with it anymore.
[02:23:06.985 --> 02:23:07.665]  He's had it.
[02:23:08.806 --> 02:23:09.347]  He's finished.
[02:23:11.727 --> 02:23:15.910]  And so he's made alliances with Iran, with Syria.
[02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:17.371]  Why do you think they killed Budo?
[02:23:19.432 --> 02:23:20.233]  Why do you think?
[02:23:22.174 --> 02:23:23.135]  Well, I'm asking you, Larry.
[02:23:24.356 --> 02:23:26.797]  Because they didn't want any stability.
[02:23:27.157 --> 02:23:32.201]  Actually, they killed her because there was a plan at the same time to kill Maliki and...
[02:23:33.945 --> 02:23:34.545]  The rest of them.
[02:23:34.725 --> 02:23:35.546]  Yeah, that's the M.O.
[02:23:35.606 --> 02:23:35.966]  I've got.
[02:23:36.006 --> 02:23:38.246]  And they machine-gunned her in front of everybody and then blew her up.
[02:23:38.487 --> 02:23:39.687]  And then said she hit her head.
[02:23:39.707 --> 02:23:43.628]  And then hundreds of witnesses and videos came out of it being a lie.
[02:23:43.668 --> 02:23:48.910]  And our media's telling us that, uh, the Lieutenant Dictator is... I got it right there on TV in front of us.
[02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:50.210]  And everybody just goes, OK.
[02:23:50.651 --> 02:23:52.411]  See, we're all looking at the Super Bowl.
[02:23:52.471 --> 02:23:54.052]  We're all looking at this election.
[02:23:55.032 --> 02:23:58.873]  What y'all better be careful of is what you're not looking at.
[02:24:00.094 --> 02:24:02.134]  Now, I want to say one thing very clear.
[02:24:02.154 --> 02:24:03.495]  I want to say it right now.
[02:24:05.187 --> 02:24:12.652]  If you think I'm against the American soldier, then you need to come to 58 Kensington Drive, Conway, Arkansas.
[02:24:14.273 --> 02:24:15.334]  Cause, we're gonna fight.
[02:24:16.675 --> 02:24:17.875]  There's no better soldier.
[02:24:18.256 --> 02:24:18.676]  No better.
[02:24:20.497 --> 02:24:21.157]  No braver.
[02:24:22.518 --> 02:24:27.341]  But you gotta understand what's ha- you gotta be a soldier to understand what's happening to them.
[02:24:28.762 --> 02:24:32.805]  These kids are serving two, three, four, five tours.
[02:24:34.546 --> 02:24:36.446]  Alex, they're coming back.
[02:24:37.587 --> 02:24:41.408]  Have you been standing by somebody when their head got blowed off?
[02:24:41.428 --> 02:24:43.768]  Have you done that?
[02:24:44.128 --> 02:24:44.628]  No, I haven't.
[02:24:45.708 --> 02:24:49.189]  Let me tell you, it's a pretty impressive thing.
[02:24:49.469 --> 02:24:51.310]  They're feeding our troops into a meat grinder.
[02:24:51.330 --> 02:24:52.930]  They're keeping them in over four tours.
[02:24:53.210 --> 02:24:55.290]  That wasn't done in Vietnam, World War, War II.
[02:24:55.691 --> 02:24:58.291]  It's like... Yeah, now, let me give you a little tip.
[02:24:58.691 --> 02:24:59.992]  Look at all the generals.
[02:25:01.052 --> 02:25:01.852]  Look at the generals.
[02:25:02.904 --> 02:25:04.726]  And I want you to look over to your left breath.
[02:25:05.926 --> 02:25:14.934]  And if you don't see this long, blue rifle, which is called a 90-day badge, that guy ain't ever even been in combat!
[02:25:16.215 --> 02:25:19.657]  We've got American soldiers right now playing chicken and egg.
[02:25:21.279 --> 02:25:22.039]  Can you believe that?
[02:25:22.860 --> 02:25:23.480]  Chicken and egg.
[02:25:25.662 --> 02:25:26.603]  What's chicken and egg?
[02:25:27.724 --> 02:25:30.486]  Let's say you and I, we're on one corner, alright?
[02:25:31.178 --> 02:25:32.739]  Of a four-way intersection, right?
[02:25:33.559 --> 02:25:35.700]  And we're sitting in an old building that's been blown up.
[02:25:37.361 --> 02:25:40.783]  We get a call from command, and you know what they tell us to do, our squad?
[02:25:40.983 --> 02:25:41.764]  Talk into your phone.
[02:25:42.764 --> 02:25:51.589]  They tell us to go across the street and set up perimeter at the other service station on the other side.
[02:25:51.709 --> 02:25:52.349]  You know why?
[02:25:53.189 --> 02:25:57.812]  So that when we cross, the enemy will shoot at us,
[02:25:58.931 --> 02:26:02.932]  And then, we'll know where the enemy is, so we can shoot back at them.
[02:26:02.972 --> 02:26:07.534]  Yeah, they put them in those little troop deployments for, quote, security as bait.
[02:26:08.794 --> 02:26:10.095]  It's called the chicken and the egg.
[02:26:10.335 --> 02:26:11.135]  Why do that?
[02:26:11.635 --> 02:26:14.676]  What difference does that corner make than the other one?
[02:26:14.716 --> 02:26:15.417]  Just sit there.
[02:26:15.457 --> 02:26:17.157]  The bad guys will come to you.
[02:26:17.677 --> 02:26:25.160]  If you've been in battle, if you've been in combat, trust me, if they're bad guys, they'll come to you.
[02:26:25.860 --> 02:26:27.781]  They'll come to you, and then you know what you do?
[02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:29.050]  You kill them.
[02:26:30.411 --> 02:26:31.452]  Then nobody gets hurt.
[02:26:32.612 --> 02:26:33.493]  Everybody comes home.
[02:26:34.894 --> 02:26:39.977]  Our soldiers need to come home now.
[02:26:40.437 --> 02:26:45.600]  Well, 70 plus percent are against the war, but they tell us they're going to stay there, showing the puppet masters on everything.
[02:26:46.020 --> 02:26:47.641]  Stay there, Larry Nichols.
[02:26:48.001 --> 02:26:52.704]  We've got Ted Sampley of Veterans Against McCain.
[02:26:53.553 --> 02:26:59.136]  Coming on the breakdown, who he is, he's just like Bob Dole, like he said, meant to lose to Hillary Clinton.
[02:26:59.837 --> 02:27:02.638]  We'll be right back with our guest, Larry Nichols.
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:08.902]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:09.842 --> 02:27:12.544]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:15.686 --> 02:27:20.632]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:27:20.952 --> 02:27:22.834]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:27:23.034 --> 02:27:26.078]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:27:26.258 --> 02:27:29.401]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:27:29.702 --> 02:27:31.564]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:27:31.824 --> 02:27:35.525]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:27:35.805 --> 02:27:38.465]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:27:38.485 --> 02:27:43.367]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:27:43.587 --> 02:27:47.867]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:27:48.268 --> 02:27:52.608]  The Bible says, Would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[02:27:52.929 --> 02:27:54.949]  These materials document the global leaders,
[02:27:55.009 --> 02:27:55.269]  We're good.
[02:28:15.985 --> 02:28:20.269]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:28:20.509 --> 02:28:25.413]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:25.614 --> 02:28:26.935]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:27.135 --> 02:28:30.498]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:28:42.248 --> 02:28:44.610]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[02:28:50.896 --> 02:28:51.837]  No animal testing.
[02:28:52.097 --> 02:28:53.419]  I use them and love them.
[02:28:53.439 --> 02:28:55.040]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:56.461]  And I save big time.
[02:28:56.742 --> 02:28:57.983]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:28:58.003 --> 02:28:58.223]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:29:08.192 --> 02:29:14.719]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:19.824]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[02:29:19.984 --> 02:29:21.365]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[02:29:25.723 --> 02:29:30.166]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[02:29:30.186 --> 02:29:32.628]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[02:29:32.968 --> 02:29:35.130]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[02:29:35.410 --> 02:29:38.312]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[02:29:40.353 --> 02:29:42.435]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[02:29:42.795 --> 02:29:48.179]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[02:29:50.081 --> 02:29:54.625]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[02:29:54.645 --> 02:29:58.888]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:29:59.488 --> 02:30:04.372]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[02:30:04.452 --> 02:30:08.656]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:30:08.936 --> 02:30:11.077]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[02:30:11.157 --> 02:30:11.938]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:30:45.074 --> 02:30:47.694]  Larry Nichols is riding shotgun with us for the rest of the half hour.
[02:30:47.714 --> 02:30:53.095]  We're going to have Ted Lane Sambley up for a full hour either next week or the week after that.
[02:30:53.115 --> 02:30:54.556]  30 minutes is not enough.
[02:30:55.076 --> 02:30:57.616]  I can't go over his incredibly distinguished military career.
[02:30:57.656 --> 02:31:00.337]  He heads up Vietnam veterans against John McCain.
[02:31:01.878 --> 02:31:09.484]  In Vietnam, Staff Sergeant Sampley served as company commander of the 36th Mike Force Civilian Irregular Defense Corps Company.
[02:31:10.565 --> 02:31:19.672]  Assigned to operate along the Cambodian border during that year of combat, Sampley was awarded four bronze stars, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry.
[02:31:20.464 --> 02:31:22.705]  And of course he was in the Green Beret Special Forces.
[02:31:22.725 --> 02:31:31.388]  In 1977 he was reassigned to the 3rd and later the 6th Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg where he continued his military training and it just goes on and on.
[02:31:31.888 --> 02:31:33.449]  All the things he did in Vietnam.
[02:31:33.989 --> 02:31:39.651]  He got, what is it, four bronze stars while he was there in Cambodia and Vietnam.
[02:31:40.391 --> 02:31:45.413]  And I've had veterans on years ago who were actually in the camp with McCain.
[02:31:46.173 --> 02:31:47.653]  He made all the propaganda films.
[02:31:47.693 --> 02:31:49.134]  He spilt his guts immediately.
[02:31:50.153 --> 02:31:52.916]  Uh, and he's just, he's anti-gun, pro-open border.
[02:31:53.597 --> 02:32:01.305]  His wife has campaigned for Hillary, whereas Hillary Clinton pins, uh, you watch, it's just like Bob Dole, they're running a dead horse against Clinton.
[02:32:01.906 --> 02:32:02.947]  And it's gonna be Hillary Clinton.
[02:32:02.967 --> 02:32:05.790]  And I told you that Romney was gonna step down, he's done that today.
[02:32:06.811 --> 02:32:10.375]  And, uh, that's exactly what Larry Nichols, who helped bring out the first, uh,
[02:32:11.346 --> 02:32:13.988]  Scandals on the Clintons and many others is saying as well.
[02:32:14.008 --> 02:32:16.450]  He's waiting in the wings to pop in and make some comments.
[02:32:16.850 --> 02:32:18.191]  Mr. Sampley, you've got the floor.
[02:32:18.231 --> 02:32:20.593]  We appreciate you coming on the show.
[02:32:20.653 --> 02:32:22.854]  Thank you very much for having me on board.
[02:32:23.194 --> 02:32:24.996]  Just condense it down as much as you can.
[02:32:26.016 --> 02:32:31.700]  When you first learned about McCain, why you head up this organization and some other groups putting out the same info.
[02:32:32.521 --> 02:32:33.902]  I mean, it's not just what he did in the war.
[02:32:33.942 --> 02:32:35.283]  They call him Mr. Anti-Corruption.
[02:32:35.303 --> 02:32:36.484]  He was part of the Keating Five.
[02:32:37.470 --> 02:32:41.694]  It's like having Herman Goering running the Nuremberg Trials and we break down who John McCain really is.
[02:32:42.074 --> 02:32:43.915]  John McCain is a chameleon.
[02:32:44.476 --> 02:32:45.837]  Like a lizard, a reptile.
[02:32:46.497 --> 02:32:50.621]  It changes, it turns the color of the limb he's on at the time and he gets away with it.
[02:32:51.141 --> 02:32:55.905]  Because he forever has had the liberal talking heads in this country.
[02:32:56.586 --> 02:33:02.070]  The Tim Russerts and Chris Matthews, that crowd adore him and cannot say enough good about him.
[02:33:03.052 --> 02:33:08.596]  And they have built this false image of a POW resistor hero.
[02:33:09.217 --> 02:33:26.770]  If you go back and read his record very clearly, at the best you can give John McCain was, he was a POW survivor who traded inflammation for better medical care and other special gifts he got from the Communists.
[02:33:32.386 --> 02:33:36.689]  So he collaborated very seriously, but I know John McCain personally.
[02:33:36.729 --> 02:33:39.772]  I met him in 1986 or 88, somewhere in there.
[02:33:39.792 --> 02:33:41.573]  I believe it was 88 when he was in Congress.
[02:33:42.474 --> 02:33:48.679]  And it was over the POW issue, and I was in his office, and it just wasn't a good feeling.
[02:33:48.699 --> 02:33:50.581]  We were supposed to be a casual conversation.
[02:33:50.821 --> 02:33:59.808]  I thought he acted a little bit like a screw was loose a little bit, because as we were talking, and I was talking about the man left behind, he got up and started walking around, and then he paced right out of the office and left me sitting there.
[02:33:59.828 --> 02:34:01.049]  He didn't say yay, nay, or anything.
[02:34:01.866 --> 02:34:05.908]  And I got up and kind of tagged along behind him, and he just outpaced me, so I just went on about my way.
[02:34:06.528 --> 02:34:27.457]  And the real concern was in 1992, during the Senate Select Committee on POW Affairs, that Senate study that the Senate commissioned, it took 18 months to study and report on what happened to the American servicemen known to have been alive in captivity, but not returned at the end of the war.
[02:34:28.362 --> 02:34:33.949]  McCain, you would think, would be the best friend of the families of the men still missing and left behind.
[02:34:34.410 --> 02:34:36.993]  He turned out to be Hanoi's best friend.
[02:34:38.475 --> 02:34:45.704]  We started looking closely and he had for some time been carrying water for the communist Vietnamese, trying to pass legislation.
[02:34:46.594 --> 02:34:51.857]  Uh, get legislation passed that would open the door to give communist Vietnam normalized relations.
[02:34:51.937 --> 02:34:56.599]  Something that we didn't want until the communist Vietnamese fessed up for what they did with our men.
[02:34:56.919 --> 02:35:02.862]  And that's why he worships them and they call him the Songbird, is because they've got all the dirt on him.
[02:35:02.882 --> 02:35:05.143]  They have everything that he did.
[02:35:05.423 --> 02:35:06.644]  They kept meticulous notes.
[02:35:06.904 --> 02:35:13.287]  And not only do the Vietnamese communists have it, the Chinese have it, the former Soviets, which would be the Russian intelligence, have it.
[02:35:13.703 --> 02:35:22.510]  The Cubans have it, and there was even some Palestinian involvement as observers in the interrogation of American prisoners of war.
[02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:26.213]  Did you call him the ultimate security risk if he was going to be the commander-in-chief?
[02:35:26.894 --> 02:35:30.496]  Absolutely, and when one other entity has it, the CIA knows what he did.
[02:35:30.917 --> 02:35:38.523]  So there's a man that at the slightest threat, that if any of those collaborations, if the seriousness of them is made public,
[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:41.340]  He'll go under.
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:44.041]  So he's going to have to bend when the CIA tells him to bend.
[02:35:44.202 --> 02:35:48.423]  Let's bring Larry Nichols in here because he's an expert on this and he was involved in black ops as well.
[02:35:49.524 --> 02:35:52.625]  Larry, you were talking earlier, this is exactly who they love.
[02:35:53.205 --> 02:35:54.266]  He's friends with the Clintons.
[02:35:54.306 --> 02:35:57.147]  Bill Clinton has said it's going to be a sweetheart race between the two.
[02:35:57.787 --> 02:36:02.289]  What do you think's happening here with McCain and how the media and the establishment is firmly behind him?
[02:36:02.329 --> 02:36:06.411]  Is it because they can destroy him any minute so they know he's totally compromised?
[02:36:06.871 --> 02:36:08.592]  Well, he's totally blackmailable.
[02:36:11.877 --> 02:36:16.259]  I mean, that's exactly what the sergeant's talking about.
[02:36:19.681 --> 02:36:21.022]  Continue, Mr. Sampling.
[02:36:21.922 --> 02:36:25.865]  Well, in Special Forces, my training was very extensive.
[02:36:27.025 --> 02:36:29.567]  I spent seven years in Special Forces out of my ten years in the Army.
[02:36:29.967 --> 02:36:35.730]  Part of my training was, at Fort Huachuca Arizona Operations and Intelligence School, I was trained as an interrogator.
[02:36:36.090 --> 02:36:37.471]  I was trained on what to look for.
[02:36:37.491 --> 02:36:41.273]  I was also trained in what to try to achieve with a
[02:36:42.063 --> 02:36:42.963]  A prisoner.
[02:36:43.104 --> 02:36:47.165]  And one of the things you want to achieve is to neutralize them and then control them.
[02:36:47.586 --> 02:36:57.390]  And the way you do that is you get them to do something they're not supposed to, or get them to do something against one of the other prisoners, and then you hold that over his head.
[02:36:57.410 --> 02:37:02.752]  Well, I'm going to tell this other prisoner you're the one that told on him and caused him to get the mess beat out of him, if you don't tell me some more.
[02:37:03.613 --> 02:37:04.733]  And Vinny's caught in this trap.
[02:37:04.753 --> 02:37:06.914]  He has to keep talking and keep talking and keep talking.
[02:37:07.274 --> 02:37:08.995]  That's the position that McCain is in.
[02:37:09.454 --> 02:37:13.315]  When it comes to what happened in Illinois Hilton.
[02:37:13.415 --> 02:37:15.676]  And there's no doubt they're still controlling him today.
[02:37:16.096 --> 02:37:18.897]  Well, he went back to Vietnam in front of witnesses.
[02:37:18.977 --> 02:37:22.138]  Bob Dornan, former congressman Bob Dornan, would tell you this.
[02:37:23.958 --> 02:37:30.620]  McCain said to the Vietnamese in front of him, if you ever release my files, you'll never see normalized relations.
[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:36.422]  Then he came back to the United States and used his authority as a senator to get all the POW records sealed.
[02:37:39.647 --> 02:37:42.948]  How many men at that time, when he got those sealed, do we know were left behind?
[02:37:42.968 --> 02:37:52.991]  The number has varied depending on who's counting, but Senator Bob Smith and former Congressman Billy Hendon, they're coming up with the numbers that could be as 200 or 300.
[02:37:53.651 --> 02:37:58.973]  We know there was a second tier of prisoners, a secret tier, that none of the other prisoners knew about.
[02:37:58.993 --> 02:38:03.475]  The Soviets were very interested in our pilots because at that time,
[02:38:03.945 --> 02:38:07.486]  Our pilots were zooming in and getting through the SAM system, missile system.
[02:38:07.506 --> 02:38:09.506]  That was the same system that was defending Moscow.
[02:38:10.967 --> 02:38:14.347]  And so they were very interested in what they could get out of these pilots.
[02:38:14.828 --> 02:38:16.228]  And they got a lot.
[02:38:16.408 --> 02:38:17.308]  And all of that is sealed.
[02:38:17.668 --> 02:38:19.229]  McCain's not the only one that collaborated.
[02:38:19.249 --> 02:38:20.849]  A lot of them did.
[02:38:21.329 --> 02:38:29.351]  And Mr. Sampley, you do realize that they have cheapened the word hero with John McCain.
[02:38:29.981 --> 02:38:30.621]  Absolutely.
[02:38:30.801 --> 02:38:32.782]  He got a silver star, and I can trace it.
[02:38:33.083 --> 02:38:41.927]  The dates he got the silver star, I read the citation, were the same dates that he, quote unquote, was trading military information for better medical care.
[02:38:43.287 --> 02:38:45.768]  Well, his daddy was the head of the Pacific Fleet.
[02:38:46.149 --> 02:38:47.929]  And his granddaddy was a famous Admiral, also.
[02:38:48.310 --> 02:38:50.291]  Right.
[02:38:50.471 --> 02:38:51.371]  That's why he got that.
[02:38:51.651 --> 02:38:59.635]  Yeah, the problem is, Mr. Champlain, and I am for you, I support you, I honor you.
[02:39:02.031 --> 02:39:08.795]  But what they're going to do now, after the Swift Boat deal, you know what you're up against.
[02:39:09.536 --> 02:39:10.036]  Absolutely.
[02:39:10.076 --> 02:39:12.898]  I was involved in the Swift Boat deal against John Kerry.
[02:39:12.958 --> 02:39:13.759]  I was one of the leaders.
[02:39:14.379 --> 02:39:17.841]  We just reinvented the organization and turned it against John McCain.
[02:39:17.941 --> 02:39:20.203]  Oh, so you know... John O'Neill.
[02:39:20.783 --> 02:39:21.103]  Yeah.
[02:39:21.984 --> 02:39:25.886]  And you know this time the media is going to be ready for you.
[02:39:26.207 --> 02:39:28.628]  They're blasting us left and right.
[02:39:28.648 --> 02:39:29.809]  Then you know Dr. Corsi, right?
[02:39:32.105 --> 02:39:34.507]  Yeah, he's a regular guest here.
[02:39:34.567 --> 02:39:35.328]  Let me say this now.
[02:39:36.769 --> 02:39:48.638]  We are planning right now a counter-offensive, and we're going online on the internet probably tomorrow or the next day, but we're opening an offensive called GOP Tea Party.
[02:39:50.059 --> 02:39:55.403]  And in the spirit of 1773, when the colonists rebelled against the King of England and tossed all that tea over,
[02:39:55.871 --> 02:39:59.213]  We're going to rebel against the Republican Party, and we're going to toss McCain over.
[02:39:59.493 --> 02:40:07.697]  We hope to make it so hot before McCain between now and September, the convention, that this Republican establishment is really going to be rethinking this thing.
[02:40:07.717 --> 02:40:08.858]  But they're all dropping out.
[02:40:09.258 --> 02:40:11.579]  Are you going to go for Huckabee or Paul?
[02:40:11.659 --> 02:40:13.080]  Here's what we're going to do.
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:17.702]  We only got to move 5-10% of the conservative Republican base.
[02:40:18.142 --> 02:40:25.466]  Simply get people to pledge that they will not vote for McCain under any circumstances, and sign a pledge to that.
[02:40:26.428 --> 02:40:27.329]  Here's the deal, sir.
[02:40:27.489 --> 02:40:28.670]  I don't believe these polls.
[02:40:28.750 --> 02:40:29.670]  I think something stinks.
[02:40:29.730 --> 02:40:30.771]  We've seen evidence of fraud.
[02:40:31.331 --> 02:40:32.672]  I know Republicans.
[02:40:32.712 --> 02:40:35.675]  I'm on a whole bunch of stations, and I do interviews all the time on other stations.
[02:40:36.315 --> 02:40:38.416]  I can't find Republicans that support McCain.
[02:40:38.536 --> 02:40:40.858]  I don't believe that he's actually winning.
[02:40:40.918 --> 02:40:46.682]  He's winning with less than 30% of the, or about 30% of the Republicans.
[02:40:46.702 --> 02:40:49.904]  Well, as bad as Romney is, he was better than McCain, and now he's dropped out.
[02:40:50.245 --> 02:40:54.968]  People don't understand or don't realize that there are a lot of left-leaning Republicans now.
[02:40:55.376 --> 02:40:58.897]  We have gotten, the Republican Party has digressed.
[02:40:59.398 --> 02:41:07.081]  So one of our objectives is, the Tea Party, is to jettison all of them and reestablish the conservative Republican Party.
[02:41:07.921 --> 02:41:12.583]  And McCain is, the people rallying around McCain are left to center.
[02:41:14.003 --> 02:41:16.945]  So you're going to do this but you're not going to be able to support a candidate?
[02:41:16.985 --> 02:41:19.306]  I mean, Ron Paul?
[02:41:19.366 --> 02:41:22.747]  No, the only pledge is, we'll not vote for John McCain.
[02:41:25.194 --> 02:41:27.536]  I mean, if Ron Paul jumps up there, vote for Ron Paul.
[02:41:27.856 --> 02:41:28.277]  I understand.
[02:41:28.297 --> 02:41:32.400]  Well, that's who I will, but I mean... If he jumps up there, I probably will too.
[02:41:33.201 --> 02:41:35.563]  We better get this word out really fast.
[02:41:36.323 --> 02:41:37.965]  I wonder if all the... We got to September.
[02:41:38.685 --> 02:41:42.569]  I wonder if all the fake mainline Republicans are going to have you on.
[02:41:42.589 --> 02:41:42.949]  They better.
[02:41:43.629 --> 02:41:47.172]  Well, I'm doing quite a few radio shows.
[02:41:47.373 --> 02:41:51.476]  I'm doing one or two a day in sizable radio shows, and I appreciate you guys inviting me.
[02:41:52.222 --> 02:41:54.263]  Well, this is news, by the way.
[02:41:54.283 --> 02:41:59.727]  This is the first time we've announced this program, this campaign we're starting, but we're going to be on the line.
[02:41:59.787 --> 02:42:01.929]  It's GOPTeaParty.com.
[02:42:02.169 --> 02:42:03.029]  Give us all the details.
[02:42:03.049 --> 02:42:03.650]  You've got the floor.
[02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:04.430]  Break it down for us.
[02:42:04.690 --> 02:42:06.432]  Well, we're setting up a website.
[02:42:06.492 --> 02:42:07.672]  It should be ready in two or three days.
[02:42:08.193 --> 02:42:17.459]  GOPTeaParty.com in the spirit of 1773 when the Boston Tea Party, when the colonists rebelled against the King of England
[02:42:18.154 --> 02:42:20.314]  We're going to rebel against the Republican Party.
[02:42:20.554 --> 02:42:29.316]  We're going to hold a, we hope to start a revolution within the Republican Party to cleanse it of all the left-leaning Republicans.
[02:42:30.676 --> 02:42:32.816]  They're showing themselves around McCain right now.
[02:42:33.057 --> 02:42:35.377]  And McCain, I don't care what you say, is a leftist.
[02:42:36.457 --> 02:42:38.357]  If you look at his major activity.
[02:42:38.397 --> 02:42:41.318]  Well, what he is is a globalist New World Order minion.
[02:42:41.878 --> 02:42:47.279]  Well, let's say what you're doing, Mr. Stanley, is smart.
[02:42:49.232 --> 02:42:53.714]  You see, people believe because you say you're a Republican, you're a Republican.
[02:42:54.695 --> 02:42:55.015]  Exactly.
[02:42:55.035 --> 02:42:57.316]  You're not!
[02:42:57.336 --> 02:42:59.398]  Lindsey Graham's not a Republican.
[02:42:59.418 --> 02:43:08.683]  We have drifted so far, the Republican Party has drifted so far to the left that we didn't even realize it.
[02:43:08.983 --> 02:43:11.744]  But McCain has exposed everybody.
[02:43:11.764 --> 02:43:16.447]  You know, I was just reading a McHale-Malcolm article
[02:43:16.843 --> 02:43:22.448]  Well, she connects John McCain and his Reform Institute to that multi-million dollar, what is it, Soros?
[02:43:23.048 --> 02:43:23.929]  George Soros, yeah.
[02:43:24.189 --> 02:43:30.334]  With donating money to McCain's Institute, and some of McCain's staffers right now work for that Institute.
[02:43:30.494 --> 02:43:33.476]  But see, that's Clinton.
[02:43:33.496 --> 02:43:35.918]  Yeah, that would go back to the Clinton connection.
[02:43:35.958 --> 02:43:37.640]  McCain is involved with the same people.
[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:39.761]  Sir, I mean, I don't know if you know this, but I'm sure you do.
[02:43:40.242 --> 02:43:46.427]  Remember back in the last two Clinton elections, McCain's wife kept getting caught campaigning for fundraising and wearing Hillary pins?
[02:43:47.239 --> 02:43:48.000]  No, I don't remember that.
[02:43:49.060 --> 02:43:49.501]  Look it up.
[02:43:49.521 --> 02:43:53.443]  I don't know.
[02:43:53.744 --> 02:44:02.049]  Well, I mean, look, it's the Republican Party itself wants big government and they want, you know, all this corporate welfare.
[02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:03.650]  And I'm sorry.
[02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:11.516]  I mean, have you seen the reports about Roger Ailes and the head of the owner of Fox, Rupert Murdoch, having fundraisers for Hillary?
[02:44:12.136 --> 02:44:12.857]  No, I haven't seen that.
[02:44:15.925 --> 02:44:25.415]  The problem, gentlemen, that we have is that as a nation, as a nation, we're running out of time.
[02:44:25.735 --> 02:44:26.436]  We've been betrayed.
[02:44:26.456 --> 02:44:27.256]  We've been infiltrated.
[02:44:28.558 --> 02:44:30.119]  We've allowed it to happen, unfortunately.
[02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:31.280]  Yeah.
[02:44:32.622 --> 02:44:34.063]  But we do have an army.
[02:44:34.744 --> 02:44:38.808]  We do have an army that we've never had before.
[02:44:40.293 --> 02:44:50.282]  And that is a huge army of people that are now unemployed, underemployed, scared that they're going to lose their job.
[02:44:50.302 --> 02:44:54.907]  Houses being repossessed.
[02:44:56.829 --> 02:45:00.292]  So for the first time, Mr. Stanley, you got an army.
[02:45:02.768 --> 02:45:03.829]  Well, he does have an army.
[02:45:03.889 --> 02:45:08.294]  He is the Vice President of Rolling Thunder Motorcycle Rally, Washington, D.C.
[02:45:08.654 --> 02:45:11.537]  I mean, you guys have gotten how many people out on their motorcycles many times?
[02:45:11.938 --> 02:45:14.420]  Well, this past Memorial Day weekend, we probably had 600,000.
[02:45:14.581 --> 02:45:21.648]  That has turned into, and I'm one of the founders of Rolling Thunder, and that's turned into one of the largest
[02:45:23.823 --> 02:45:24.523]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:45:48.168 --> 02:45:49.349]  And do something like political.
[02:45:49.829 --> 02:45:51.411]  We have to be very careful of that.
[02:45:51.811 --> 02:46:02.360]  But at Vietnam Veterans Against McCain, which is VietnamVeteransAgainstJohnMcCain.com, and we'll get links to that up on the websites, people could get in there and expose him.
[02:46:02.860 --> 02:46:06.143]  Sure.
[02:46:06.163 --> 02:46:08.905]  We're getting plenty of people reading our website.
[02:46:08.925 --> 02:46:14.510]  It's gotten off to a small start, like a pebble tossed out in a little pond, and a little ripple started, but it's getting bigger and bigger.
[02:46:15.129 --> 02:46:18.530]  And so it's similar to what happened when we went up against John Kerry.
[02:46:18.550 --> 02:46:20.271]  We were the first to open up on John Kerry.
[02:46:20.551 --> 02:46:21.672]  We took a lot of crap.
[02:46:21.692 --> 02:46:27.294]  Same stuff that's still being thrown at us about McCain was thrown at us about John Kerry.
[02:46:27.614 --> 02:46:32.376]  We weathered it, and the next thing you know, the Swift boats, John O'Neill's crowd jumped in and they just took it on home.
[02:46:32.676 --> 02:46:34.777]  But let's be clear.
[02:46:36.137 --> 02:46:41.600]  In my opinion, and we're talking about these globalists, it's all the same, McCain is much worse than even Kerry.
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:42.340]  Yes.
[02:46:43.188 --> 02:46:44.529]  Because we know where Kerry's going.
[02:46:45.069 --> 02:46:46.650]  McCain is a deceiver.
[02:46:48.250 --> 02:46:49.331]  He is the great deceiver.
[02:46:49.911 --> 02:46:50.751]  You can't trust him.
[02:46:52.612 --> 02:47:00.836]  And I want to remind people that McCain was only just one little breath away from accepting the Vice President position with John Kerry.
[02:47:01.136 --> 02:47:06.098]  He was actually shielding John Kerry from the swift boat bit.
[02:47:06.138 --> 02:47:08.059]  So you're hoping that by the convention,
[02:47:09.103 --> 02:47:13.025]  I mean, what do you do if he's got all the delegates and Romney and others who are just as bad?
[02:47:14.526 --> 02:47:15.327]  We don't care.
[02:47:15.927 --> 02:47:30.695]  We know if we can move from five to ten percent of the Republicans that normally vote to say, I'm not going to vote for McCain, that will cause McCain to lose and the Republicans to lose.
[02:47:30.936 --> 02:47:38.520]  The Republican establishment knows that, and if they see that coming into the convention, they're going to have to do some tap dancing, and we hope they're going to eject
[02:47:39.113 --> 02:47:40.033]  We're good to go.
[02:47:59.182 --> 02:47:59.863]  It is a big idea.
[02:47:59.883 --> 02:48:00.423]  A new world order.
[02:48:00.483 --> 02:48:02.605]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[02:48:25.717 --> 02:48:27.519]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:48:27.679 --> 02:48:30.781]  Wasn't their objective to be world domination?
[02:48:31.342 --> 02:48:33.784]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:48:34.524 --> 02:48:41.850]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:48:44.861 --> 02:48:49.842]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:48:50.322 --> 02:48:53.783]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:48:54.183 --> 02:48:56.664]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:48:56.744 --> 02:48:57.884]  Most people have no idea.
[02:48:57.904 --> 02:48:58.684]  They're not after money.
[02:48:58.704 --> 02:48:59.764]  They have all the money they need.
[02:48:59.984 --> 02:49:00.684]  They're after power.
[02:49:00.944 --> 02:49:01.965]  That's what they're after.
[02:49:02.105 --> 02:49:06.646]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:49:06.846 --> 02:49:10.286]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:10.386 --> 02:49:13.307]  In Game, food prep for global enslavement.
[02:49:13.727 --> 02:49:14.888]  You have been warned.
[02:49:17.131 --> 02:49:21.194]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[02:49:21.975 --> 02:49:29.842]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues too.
[02:49:30.303 --> 02:49:35.628]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts,
[02:49:36.377 --> 02:49:42.381]  Now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:49:42.481 --> 02:49:42.981]  Central.
[02:49:43.362 --> 02:49:49.726]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is a network often imitated but never duplicated.
[02:49:50.426 --> 02:49:56.770]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:49:57.291 --> 02:50:02.334]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:50:03.130 --> 02:50:08.635]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:50:09.015 --> 02:50:10.396]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:50:10.476 --> 02:50:12.518]  Central with The Divided Kingdom.
[02:50:15.538 --> 02:50:16.018]  Hi, Ken.
[02:50:16.058 --> 02:50:16.839]  It's Judy again.
[02:50:16.859 --> 02:50:21.381]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[02:50:21.521 --> 02:50:24.663]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[02:50:24.903 --> 02:50:26.764]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[02:50:27.044 --> 02:50:29.125]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[02:50:29.305 --> 02:50:35.428]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[02:50:35.608 --> 02:50:40.911]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[02:50:41.171 --> 02:50:44.032]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[02:50:44.152 --> 02:50:45.073]  Go KenSolar!
[02:50:46.374 --> 02:50:47.915]  Get the best of both worlds.
[02:50:48.316 --> 02:50:53.380]  Solar power for your household essentials and a backup generator all-in-one.
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:54.981]  Perfect for hurricane seasons.
[02:50:55.001 --> 02:50:58.804]  No long gas lines, no fumes and no noise.
[02:50:59.524 --> 02:51:02.186]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.
[02:51:02.847 --> 02:51:05.169]  Complete solar kits for under $1,200.
[02:51:05.409 --> 02:51:09.512]  See the complete solar power generator kit at KenSolar.com.
[02:51:09.672 --> 02:51:13.495]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[02:51:19.016 --> 02:51:21.017]  I want to thank Larry Nichols for spending time with us today.
[02:51:21.037 --> 02:51:22.838]  We're going to have a final word from him in a moment.
[02:51:24.399 --> 02:51:26.681]  And I hope that you'll take his words very serious.
[02:51:27.581 --> 02:51:30.723]  You weren't taking calls during this interview, and I had a call into the board.
[02:51:31.464 --> 02:51:34.165]  Somebody got the back line going, this guy is incredible, blah, blah, blah.
[02:51:34.786 --> 02:51:36.347]  I've checked out everything he's talking about.
[02:51:37.087 --> 02:51:39.769]  And you just, I guess, weren't around during the whole Clinton scandals.
[02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.629]  OK?
[02:51:40.970 --> 02:51:43.051]  This guy had the media go over him with a fine-tooth comb.
[02:51:43.071 --> 02:51:45.272]  He's the guy that released all the big scandals.
[02:51:46.173 --> 02:51:47.514]  He did do the things he said he did.
[02:51:48.661 --> 02:51:56.989]  I want to say something to the Free Republic people, and even some of the World Net Daily folks, and all of them that have sold out to the neocons, that think all this is cute.
[02:51:57.009 --> 02:51:59.932]  You've been gamed by the Puppet Masters, as Larry says.
[02:52:01.654 --> 02:52:05.998]  As much as I like this other group going after McCain, and he is bad, they're putting him in.
[02:52:06.618 --> 02:52:11.063]  And they mean for him to fail, and for Ann Coulter to now endorse Hillary.
[02:52:11.701 --> 02:52:12.482]  And for that to happen.
[02:52:12.502 --> 02:52:16.565]  Now, we could shoot down McCain early and... I hate to play lesser of two evils.
[02:52:16.645 --> 02:52:20.348]  I mean, Huckabee, even though he's CFR, would be better than this guy.
[02:52:20.368 --> 02:52:22.249]  I mean, you can't get any worse than McCain.
[02:52:22.710 --> 02:52:23.711]  But he's a Clintonista.
[02:52:23.751 --> 02:52:24.952]  He's in bed with them completely.
[02:52:25.652 --> 02:52:26.893]  Just like Fox News is.
[02:52:26.993 --> 02:52:28.574]  And good job, Freepers, all of you.
[02:52:28.715 --> 02:52:29.915]  You've helped destroy the country.
[02:52:30.636 --> 02:52:35.540]  You just love to hate Islamofascist so much when our own boys, our own system, created it.
[02:52:36.115 --> 02:52:38.156]  Larry Nichols, final comments on the point I just made.
[02:52:38.576 --> 02:52:42.818]  Well, first off, too, Sergeant Stanley, what a terrific hero.
[02:52:43.699 --> 02:52:44.379]  It don't matter.
[02:52:44.399 --> 02:52:46.380]  He ain't going in.
[02:52:46.420 --> 02:52:48.461]  McCain's not be there to go in.
[02:52:48.541 --> 02:52:49.581]  Hillary's going in.
[02:52:50.222 --> 02:52:51.362]  That's where we fight.
[02:52:51.602 --> 02:52:53.123]  Congress is where we win.
[02:52:53.143 --> 02:53:00.347]  And to the people that don't believe, look, my life's an open book.
[02:53:02.428 --> 02:53:03.068]  I don't hide.
[02:53:03.088 --> 02:53:05.429]  I don't hide my phone number.
[02:53:06.283 --> 02:53:07.224]  I don't have my phone.
[02:53:07.304 --> 02:53:08.945]  I don't have my address.
[02:53:12.147 --> 02:53:30.240]  And as Alex knows, from the BBC, to Good God, the Washington Post, to the New York Times, to the Time Magazine, to NBC, CBS, 60 Minutes.
[02:53:31.961 --> 02:53:32.562]  Look, folks.
[02:53:33.573 --> 02:53:37.776]  If they'd spotted me telling one little fib, it'd have been over.
[02:53:40.739 --> 02:53:41.579]  It ain't over yet.
[02:53:43.521 --> 02:53:45.742]  Well, Larry, I'm not going to wait five years to have you back on.
[02:53:45.762 --> 02:53:53.508]  I want to get you back up in the next few weeks, because you're the cleansing expert, and I just really appreciate all the fine work that you've done, my friend.
[02:53:53.528 --> 02:53:56.150]  Go ahead and give out your number for other talk shows that may want to interview you.
[02:53:56.170 --> 02:53:56.210]  501-329-1159.
[02:54:03.908 --> 02:54:04.649]  Thank you so much.
[02:54:05.029 --> 02:54:05.970]  Larry Nichols, take care.
[02:54:05.990 --> 02:54:06.851]  Thank you.
[02:54:09.212 --> 02:54:11.194]  Folks, the show's basically over.
[02:54:12.155 --> 02:54:15.918]  If you missed any of the first or second hour, it was all invaluable information.
[02:54:15.958 --> 02:54:17.900]  I mean, very important show today.
[02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:20.282]  The second hour was off the charts important.
[02:54:20.322 --> 02:54:21.182]  Call everybody you know.
[02:54:21.303 --> 02:54:22.143]  Email your email list.
[02:54:22.464 --> 02:54:23.184]  That's how we grow.
[02:54:23.224 --> 02:54:24.145]  It's how we reach more people.
[02:54:24.685 --> 02:54:26.447]  Tell them to go to the newinfowars.com.
[02:54:27.304 --> 02:54:30.707]  Tell them to go to PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com, get this information.
[02:54:30.747 --> 02:54:32.368]  We know what the globalists are doing.
[02:54:32.408 --> 02:54:33.088]  We understand.
[02:54:33.128 --> 02:54:35.330]  We tell you decades before what's going to happen.
[02:54:36.030 --> 02:54:36.451]  We know.
[02:54:36.571 --> 02:54:37.792]  We're the people that know.
[02:54:37.972 --> 02:54:39.133]  This is what we do full-time.
[02:54:39.893 --> 02:54:40.674]  This is who we are.
[02:54:43.276 --> 02:54:55.765]  And some of the greatest assets we have are people that work for this system, who when they saw dead children, that's always the story we get, just finally had their Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus moment.
[02:54:58.607 --> 02:55:03.590]  So please, when the show ends in about two minutes, go to InfoWars.com if you missed any of it.
[02:55:03.630 --> 02:55:04.791]  There's the streams right there.
[02:55:05.071 --> 02:55:05.992]  The show's going to restart.
[02:55:07.993 --> 02:55:10.254]  Also, I have produced 18 films.
[02:55:10.274 --> 02:55:11.535]  That's how we fund this operation.
[02:55:11.555 --> 02:55:13.296]  I've been so busy lately, I haven't even been plugging them.
[02:55:13.316 --> 02:55:24.163]  You can see them online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv and get a membership for 15 cents a day, get a couple months free when you sign up for a year, or just get a trial monthly for $5.95.
[02:55:24.663 --> 02:55:26.945]  That supports us, but the most important thing is the info.
[02:55:27.637 --> 02:55:34.399]  Or get hard copies of the DVDs, books, films we carry, not just the films I made, at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:55:35.379 --> 02:55:42.681]  They're bringing in martial law, they're bringing down the country.
[02:55:42.701 --> 02:55:47.163]  I agree with him, the economic attack is worse than any terror attack.
[02:55:47.603 --> 02:55:48.323]  And they're attacking us.
[02:55:49.142 --> 02:55:50.063]  Balls in your court?
[02:55:50.503 --> 02:55:51.404]  God bless you all.
[02:55:51.504 --> 02:55:54.307]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:54.387 --> 02:55:58.070]  Thank you for listening to GPN.
