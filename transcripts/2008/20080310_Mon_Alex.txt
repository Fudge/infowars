[00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:06.559]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:08.280]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.080]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:11.561]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:13.202]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:17.523]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:22.145]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:35.419]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:35.979]  Welcome.
[00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:37.400]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:40.262]  It is the 10th day of March, 2008.
[00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:41.924]  It is Monday.
[00:00:41.944 --> 00:00:47.327]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.288 --> 00:00:51.310]  And we have two important guests joining us today.
[00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.953]  We have Matt Rothschild coming on the show.
[00:00:55.862 --> 00:01:05.224]  Writing for The Nation magazine a few weeks ago, the FBI deputizes businesses... Excuse me, he was writing for The Progressive.
[00:01:05.244 --> 00:01:06.164]  He also writes for The Nation.
[00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:18.067]  And that report got into how the FBI has recruited 20-plus thousand executives with shoot-to-kill orders adhering martial law.
[00:01:18.907 --> 00:01:22.168]  FBI has now called the InfraGard story patently false,
[00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:28.037]  But then you read their counter to his piece and they basically admit almost all of it.
[00:01:28.898 --> 00:01:41.406]  We already know, though, through the preacher program where they recruited 26,000 preachers that that is exactly what they are doing.
[00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:42.767]  So that's coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:01:43.991 --> 00:01:47.214]  Then we're going to have open phones and cover a ton of news in the second hour.
[00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:56.403]  In the third hour, joining us for part two of the interview we did a couple weeks ago, Jeffrey Smith, best-selling, global best-selling author on GMO Foods.
[00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:01.892]  And what's happening to our environment, how it's affecting the population of the planet.
[00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:06.913]  He's going to be joining us really on a monthly basis because he has so much knowledge.
[00:02:06.953 --> 00:02:14.474]  And we'll do part two of exactly what these GMO foods are doing to all of us and exactly how many different products they are in.
[00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:17.755]  So that is coming up in the third hour today.
[00:02:19.215 --> 00:02:21.856]  Here is one of the three stacks of news I have in front of me.
[00:02:22.668 --> 00:02:27.270]  Climate change may spark conflict with Russia, the European Union has been told.
[00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.014]  Also, how should 9-11 Truth activists respond to a smear campaign by the Simon Wiesenthal Center saying 9-11 Truth are terrorists?
[00:02:37.034 --> 00:02:48.299]  Those talking points were put out by them a few months ago, and now you see Fox, CNN, MSNBC saying we should, quote, be sent to secret prisons, we should be tased, we should be beaten, we are terrorists.
[00:02:49.662 --> 00:03:05.791]  The George Washington blog is saying that the groups that have been named, and they've named architects and engineers and others, who politely asked them in several letters and in demonstrations at their facility, at their headquarters, to retract these statements, and they refused to do it.
[00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:07.372]  They're calling for a lawsuit against them.
[00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:09.033]  I think it's a great idea.
[00:03:09.073 --> 00:03:11.674]  I'm not a litigious person, but when somebody says you're a terrorist...
[00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:13.522]  So, we'll talk about that today.
[00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.651]  Perhaps we should get the fellow that wrote this story on the show to talk about it.
[00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:44.915]  Also, new proposals to fight global warming would end civilization, kill billions, by Paul Joseph Watson today on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:48.397]  New York cops blame anarchists for Times Square bombing.
[00:03:49.637 --> 00:03:57.141]  And, of course, every time we see a staged event, it's police staging and military or FBI posing as anarchists.
[00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:04.302]  In almost every case we've seen, there are some real anarchists, but the ones that actually go out and engage in violence going back to the turn of the last century.
[00:04:05.843 --> 00:04:07.004]  The famous bombing in 1920.
[00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:10.686]  The Stock Exchange was the government operation.
[00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:13.867]  That's all come out, in hindsight.
[00:04:14.648 --> 00:04:16.409]  And so they're saying, oh, the bombing.
[00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.511]  The bombing must have been by the anarchists.
[00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:26.943]  And then Geraldo Rivera came out and said, it's probably 9-11 truthers.
[00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:28.064]  No, no, you've got it wrong.
[00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:34.370]  We're the group that exposes that violence is bad and that governments tend to stage it and blame it on their enemies.
[00:04:36.932 --> 00:04:39.895]  China to stick with its one-child eugenics policy.
[00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:43.518]  Drugs and drinking water, at least 41 million Americans.
[00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:46.721]  Pharmacologicals lurking in U.S.
[00:04:46.761 --> 00:04:48.082]  drinking water, we'll cover that.
[00:04:49.787 --> 00:04:51.088]  I'll tell you what type of drugs.
[00:04:51.948 --> 00:05:00.912]  On the other side, this is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:02.132 --> 00:05:03.533]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.654]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.354 --> 00:05:10.656]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:13.397]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.339]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.260]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew
[00:05:20.038 --> 00:05:27.446]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.355]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.855 --> 00:05:36.556]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:36.576 --> 00:05:37.477]  They're not after money.
[00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:38.798]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:38.898 --> 00:05:40.119]  They're after power.
[00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.220]  That's what they have to use.
[00:06:01.172 --> 00:06:01.833]  It's a fact.
[00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:09.518]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:06:09.638 --> 00:06:18.504]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:06:18.784 --> 00:06:29.331]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:30.472]  That's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org.

[00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:19.994]  We're good to go.

[00:08:02.302 --> 00:08:04.463]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:05.063 --> 00:08:07.944]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.291]  People should not be upset or saddened
[00:08:30.006 --> 00:08:54.675]  Well, you should be upset, but not saddened or scared by the fact that Geraldo Rivera, Bill O'Reilly, Fox & Friends, of course, Scarborough, all of them across the board, in unison, CNN's Glenn Beck,
[00:08:56.275 --> 00:09:00.237]  Are all saying the military needs to be used against 9-11 truthers.
[00:09:00.938 --> 00:09:02.638]  We are domestic enemies.
[00:09:02.678 --> 00:09:03.759]  We need to be arrested.
[00:09:04.099 --> 00:09:05.880]  We need to be taken to secret facilities.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.901]  We need to be tortured.
[00:09:07.281 --> 00:09:08.221]  We need to be tased.
[00:09:08.241 --> 00:09:10.422]  We need to be beaten to a pulp at least.
[00:09:11.003 --> 00:09:13.624]  Tased and beaten to a pulp at least.
[00:09:14.565 --> 00:09:15.565]  This is a talking point.
[00:09:15.665 --> 00:09:18.987]  It means we are hurting them extremely badly.
[00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:20.668]  In a big way.
[00:09:20.708 --> 00:09:26.817]  We are exposing the military industrial complex at the behest of its banker owners, carried out the 9-11 attacks.
[00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:35.449]  They are so scared that former presidents and high-level CIA section chiefs and engineers and movie stars are coming out.
[00:09:36.354 --> 00:09:38.695]  They're being exposed for torture and rape of children.
[00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:42.236]  They're being exposed for lying about WMDs.
[00:09:42.756 --> 00:09:46.517]  They're being exposed for other government-sponsored terror events that have been declassified.
[00:09:46.978 --> 00:09:51.319]  They are losing the war for the hearts and minds of the people of the planet.
[00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:53.220]  Especially intellectuals.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.941]  People in powerful positions in academia are waking up and speaking out.
[00:09:58.241 --> 00:09:59.842]  The chilling effect has been broken.
[00:10:00.662 --> 00:10:02.543]  Folks are getting past their fear.
[00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:05.704]  They're grappling with it and they're emerging with courage.
[00:10:06.525 --> 00:10:09.906]  And the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit and be enslaved.
[00:10:11.507 --> 00:10:21.670]  And so, we should take heart by this, but I probably got, I don't know, a hundred emails, saw blurbs, message boards, his quotes.
[00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:28.773]  Just like last week, within just a few hours of it happening, I had hundreds of reports coming in,
[00:10:30.072 --> 00:10:40.902]  That on the Daily Joe with Joe Scarborough on MSNBC, they called for 9-11 truthers to be arrested, to be sent to camps, to be tortured.
[00:10:42.063 --> 00:10:43.124]  Quote, secret camps.
[00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:52.873]  And we didn't know that was true, but I knew it was true because, you know, when you're getting all these different emails, MySpace posts, message board posts, where there's smoke, there's fire.
[00:10:52.893 --> 00:10:55.395]  If you get one report, it's probably not true, but you get scores.
[00:10:56.443 --> 00:11:03.328]  And within an hour or so, it popped up on YouTube, and we were able to play that audio here and prove yet again they were doing that.
[00:11:03.348 --> 00:11:04.949]  We've got a whole catalog of these clips.
[00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.812]  We've got to put all those together online, or somebody should.
[00:11:08.832 --> 00:11:10.313]  It's a team effort here.
[00:11:11.554 --> 00:11:20.601]  But Geraldo Herrera, Friday, said that, with no evidence, they were pontificating on the morning show with Fox and Friends.
[00:11:21.522 --> 00:11:24.604]  That's been identified, and they had Geraldo Herrera on as a guest on
[00:11:25.558 --> 00:11:28.720]  Normally, the parts of that show are posted a few days after.
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.381]  I went and looked yesterday and couldn't find it.
[00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:30.981]  Maybe you can.
[00:11:31.582 --> 00:11:39.667]  And Geraldo Havera reportedly said, I think it's the 9-11 truther crowd that bombed the recruiting station.
[00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:41.800]  There's no evidence.
[00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:42.542]  He just said it.
[00:11:42.562 --> 00:11:56.063]  And that's an important part of our chronicle to be able to find that and have that for posterity and document their White House slash Pentagon Black Ops continued demonization campaign.
[00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:06.034]  And notice that we've seen Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck and others say, mark my words, it's going to get violent.
[00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.435]  Mark my words, they're going to hurt somebody.
[00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:12.258]  Mark my words, they're the type that support McVeigh.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:22.246]  There's at least three different TV networks, CNN, Fox, and MSNBC, that have said that exact talking point.
[00:12:23.447 --> 00:12:26.550]  Not just that we need to be put in secret camps and arrested.
[00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.051]  See, they're trying to
[00:12:28.675 --> 00:12:32.497]  Test the water, get everybody ready for that, because we're their natural enemy.
[00:12:32.537 --> 00:12:35.399]  We expose that their bosses are staging the terror attacks.
[00:12:35.459 --> 00:12:49.428]  We expose that the people that own and run the mainstream media are the military-industrial complex, who in tune is owned by the big central banks that create this credit out of nothing and buy up the planet with it.
[00:12:50.009 --> 00:13:01.731]  And they understand that if their lie of 9-11 is destroyed, then their entire foundation for invading nations, setting up police states, militarizing and federalizing our police, will implode in on itself.
[00:13:01.851 --> 00:13:02.732]  It is the big lie.
[00:13:02.752 --> 00:13:04.492]  9-11 is the big fraud.
[00:13:04.592 --> 00:13:05.252]  It is the key.
[00:13:05.592 --> 00:13:06.352]  One of the main keys.
[00:13:06.392 --> 00:13:07.833]  And we've got to use that key.
[00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:14.254]  We've got to continue to grow and expand and continue to confront politicians, local, national, international.
[00:13:14.634 --> 00:13:18.955]  And that's happening everywhere with the different 9-11 truth groups, the We Are Change groups.
[00:13:19.655 --> 00:13:28.224]  It's spontaneously happening and they can't infiltrate or demonize or stop them all at the grassroots, so they're trying to do it nationally and that's falling flat on its face.
[00:13:28.244 --> 00:13:28.925]  Don't you understand?
[00:13:29.406 --> 00:13:30.547]  You're discredited now.
[00:13:30.607 --> 00:13:31.768]  People know you're liars.
[00:13:31.828 --> 00:13:37.955]  They know you're dishonest, Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck and Joe Scarborough and the rest of you.
[00:13:38.055 --> 00:13:39.957]  They know who you are.
[00:13:40.477 --> 00:13:41.819]  They know your agenda.
[00:13:42.469 --> 00:13:48.812]  And so you may have 10, 15, 20% of the public, depending on the poll you look at, that buy your Kool-Aid still and drink your Kool-Aid.
[00:13:49.273 --> 00:13:50.473]  The rest of us don't anymore.
[00:13:50.994 --> 00:13:59.538]  So by the very nature of the fact that you're still attacking us, because you have to, only fuels our fire, only shows people that we're right.
[00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:02.340]  Because they know you're a pack of lying scum.
[00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:08.503]  Posing as populist, posing as pro-America.
[00:14:09.645 --> 00:14:22.671]  When your real job is to pacify people to sell a Hillary Obama slash McCain ticket to sell us on further gun control open borders debasing the hidden tax of currency devaluation.
[00:14:23.611 --> 00:14:29.373]  And people now are finding out that all along we were right about everything.
[00:14:29.474 --> 00:14:31.394]  Everything we talked about has happened now.
[00:14:31.815 --> 00:14:37.537]  Everything we warned you about has come to fruition, has developed, has unfolded exactly as we said it would.
[00:14:39.244 --> 00:14:45.412]  And now our credibility, our stock, just goes up and up and up and up and up by the millisecond.
[00:14:46.894 --> 00:14:52.101]  And we are not a movement that is horizontally integrated.
[00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:55.406]  We are the opposite of that.
[00:14:56.244 --> 00:15:08.738]  Millions of lone wolves and lone wolf packs in the InfoWar engaging your hellhounds and defeating you every single time across the board.
[00:15:08.818 --> 00:15:11.822]  And we are virally, to use that term,
[00:15:12.422 --> 00:15:28.189]  Exploding, and they are now afraid, and they should be, because you have poisoned the population, you have murdered the population, you have brainwashed the population, you have lied to the population, and the population is just now coming awake from a deep sleep.
[00:15:28.649 --> 00:15:35.112]  They're drinking a big, fat, boiling hot cup of coffee right now, and they're seeing who their enemy is, and they know it isn't us.
[00:15:35.452 --> 00:15:37.033]  They know it's you, Jack.
[00:15:38.233 --> 00:15:39.334]  And they understand that.
[00:15:40.751 --> 00:15:42.991]  So the battle will be joined in the Infowar.
[00:15:43.372 --> 00:15:46.032]  Our enemies will no doubt throw fits and stage terror attacks.
[00:15:46.452 --> 00:15:47.352]  Only trick they know.
[00:15:47.732 --> 00:15:49.453]  It may even look like they win for the day.
[00:15:50.893 --> 00:15:52.693]  But in the end, they will collapse.
[00:15:52.754 --> 00:15:54.234]  They will fall, just like Hitler.
[00:15:55.114 --> 00:15:55.854]  Just like Mao.
[00:15:55.894 --> 00:15:56.754]  Just like Stalin.
[00:15:56.814 --> 00:15:58.435]  You will be defeated.
[00:15:58.835 --> 00:16:00.415]  You have lost the hearts and minds.
[00:16:00.735 --> 00:16:02.255]  And it's only the beginning.
[00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:09.337]  So go ahead and preposterously claim that 9-11 proofs behind bombings.
[00:16:10.896 --> 00:16:12.097]  Go ahead and grab a patsy.
[00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:12.937]  People won't buy it.
[00:16:14.077 --> 00:16:15.858]  Go ahead and stage events.
[00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:19.940]  Go ahead and demonize the web and try to shut it down.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:20.940]  Go ahead!
[00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:26.703]  There is no going back.
[00:16:28.144 --> 00:16:31.525]  You can't put the horse back in the pen.
[00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:32.766]  It's already long gone.
[00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:35.367]  Okay.
[00:16:37.328 --> 00:16:37.648]  Let me...
[00:16:38.852 --> 00:16:40.893]  Get into the drugs and the water report.
[00:16:41.073 --> 00:16:43.775]  Then I'll get into New York cops playing anarchists for Times Square Blast.
[00:16:44.235 --> 00:16:47.917]  New proposal to fight global warming would end civilization, kill billions.
[00:16:48.638 --> 00:16:49.058]  No joke.
[00:16:50.579 --> 00:16:56.502]  China is continuing with its eugenics program that it signed in 1975 and an agreement with the U.S.
[00:16:56.562 --> 00:16:57.222]  and UNESCO.
[00:16:58.603 --> 00:17:04.406]  George Bush, as ambassador, penned with them under State Department Memorandum 200.
[00:17:07.413 --> 00:17:09.695]  But let me right now just get into drugs and drinking water.
[00:17:09.715 --> 00:17:13.838]  It's funny, this story came out this year, came out yesterday.
[00:17:13.858 --> 00:17:15.820]  I meant to say it comes out every year.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:23.146]  The AP goes out and just does a small canvas of big city water testing facilities.
[00:17:25.268 --> 00:17:29.251]  And they pretty much always find the same information.
[00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:30.272]  The reason it's funny is,
[00:17:32.501 --> 00:17:36.784]  I didn't see this report yesterday, Sunday, when I was on air from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:17:36.804 --> 00:17:41.767]  When I got off the show, Trey, who also runs the Sunday show, said, Hey, look at this.
[00:17:41.907 --> 00:17:50.472]  AP, tens of millions of Americans just in this limited test, drinking a cocktail of drugs.
[00:17:51.533 --> 00:17:56.596]  It was funny that this came up yesterday because I had just talked about Dr. Dean Adele on air.
[00:17:57.356 --> 00:18:00.478]  The guy is on quite a few stations right before I am on Sunday.
[00:18:00.498 --> 00:18:01.839]  Hmm.
[00:18:02.674 --> 00:18:13.900]  And he says there's no mercury in vaccines and the water is absolutely delicious and wonderful and there's nothing in the water and filtering your water is stupid and it's great that governments are moving to ban bottled water because it's bad.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.041]  Actually, I agree in a weird way.
[00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:21.864]  They just normally take tap water and it turns out being dirtier because it then sits there and whatever bacteria are in there grow.
[00:18:21.884 --> 00:18:23.265]  There's a lot of studies on that.
[00:18:24.425 --> 00:18:25.326]  There are some good brands.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.481]  You've got to go investigate that.
[00:18:27.521 --> 00:18:29.983]  There are groups and watchdog groups that chronicle and track all that.
[00:18:30.163 --> 00:18:31.564]  But he wasn't saying it because of that.
[00:18:31.824 --> 00:18:39.589]  He was saying because the water is good, we should ban bottled water and make you drink tap water, that it's just a conspiracy and insane.
[00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.391]  By the way, we're challenging Dr. Dean Adele to come on this show.
[00:18:43.472 --> 00:18:46.074]  I mean, he wants to say there's no mercury in vaccines?
[00:18:46.134 --> 00:18:46.754]  Come on, buddy.
[00:18:47.095 --> 00:18:49.877]  I'm going to sit here reading all the documents and news articles where there are.
[00:18:51.698 --> 00:18:54.600]  But forget all the drugs in the water, and I'm going to get into that in a moment.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:55.861]  That is nothing.
[00:18:56.727 --> 00:18:57.227]  And it's bad.
[00:18:58.267 --> 00:19:15.433]  But that is nothing compared to, if you go to the, and about a year ago I did this, I hadn't done it in a while, I forget the exact search term, it's like allowable levels of toxins or contaminants, allowable levels of toxins or contaminants, I try either search, EPA.
[00:19:16.973 --> 00:19:21.394]  And you go to their website, and I spent, I remember one day like four hours reading it.
[00:19:21.835 --> 00:19:24.655]  And it was so much knowledge, I never even really came on air and talked about it.
[00:19:24.976 --> 00:19:26.416]  I just said, oh boy, you ought to go look at it.
[00:19:27.509 --> 00:19:30.852]  But somebody ought to make a mini-video or something.
[00:19:31.452 --> 00:19:32.493]  Again, we can't do it all here.
[00:19:32.533 --> 00:19:34.314]  You, the listeners, are doing that for YouTube.
[00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:39.738]  Where we just go to their website and show the parts per million they allow of everything.
[00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:46.803]  MBTE, motor oil, pesticides, hundreds of pesticides, hundreds of herbicides, mercury, lead, arsenic.
[00:19:47.484 --> 00:19:51.087]  I mean, it's thousands of things that are in all the water supplies.
[00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:52.648]  Thousands.
[00:19:52.888 --> 00:19:56.771]  And the key, when we get back, the absolute key to all this, when we return...
[00:20:02.782 --> 00:20:04.843]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.464 --> 00:20:14.389]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.869 --> 00:20:22.033]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:26.615]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMed Inc.'
[00:20:26.595 --> 00:20:28.235]  's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.735 --> 00:20:39.558]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.318 --> 00:20:42.399]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.899 --> 00:20:44.299]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:21:03.485]  www.LASEMEDINC.com Call 702-953-0267 It is a big idea.
[00:21:03.505 --> 00:21:05.626]  A new world order.
[00:21:06.326 --> 00:21:10.548]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:11.188 --> 00:21:13.009]  It's known as the Builderberg.
[00:21:13.169 --> 00:21:16.290]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.231]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:20.004 --> 00:21:27.330]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:35.336]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.817 --> 00:21:39.279]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.659 --> 00:21:41.741]  Build-A-Bear gets to make some big progress toward the world.
[00:21:42.221 --> 00:21:43.382]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.402 --> 00:21:44.162]  They're not after money.
[00:21:44.182 --> 00:21:45.243]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.463 --> 00:21:46.184]  They're after power.
[00:21:46.444 --> 00:21:47.184]  That's what happens.
[00:21:47.605 --> 00:21:55.390]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:59.092]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:21:59.132 --> 00:22:00.133]  You have been warned.
[00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:05.577]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:22:05.717 --> 00:22:10.922]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:22:11.122 --> 00:22:15.906]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:22:16.186 --> 00:22:27.295]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:22:27.595 --> 00:22:33.119]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:39.443]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:40.284]  What about you?
[00:22:40.564 --> 00:22:42.465]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[00:22:42.485 --> 00:22:46.628]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[00:22:46.788 --> 00:22:48.470]  Call Jeff and order now by calling 562-544-0507.
[00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:49.110]  That's Jeff at 562-544-0507.
[00:22:56.255 --> 00:22:56.776]  We're good to go.
[00:23:16.374 --> 00:23:16.994]  We're good to go.
[00:23:46.414 --> 00:23:46.934]  We're good to go.
[00:24:16.026 --> 00:24:30.969]  Okay.
[00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:37.411]  I get emails by people that are confused, mainly mainline liberals that are starting to unplug from the Matrix.
[00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:40.172]  And they say, you confuse me.
[00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:42.032]  You say GMO foods are bad.
[00:24:42.808 --> 00:24:48.089]  And you say the water's full of poison, but then you say global warming isn't real and we don't need to do something about the environment.
[00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.271]  The elites could care less about the environment.
[00:24:52.591 --> 00:24:53.271]  Care less.
[00:24:53.331 --> 00:24:56.692]  They only use the regulations to shut down any other competition.
[00:24:57.532 --> 00:25:10.836]  And they use your well-founded fears of the environmental catastrophes and holocausts that are going on against the biosphere, and it is serious, and it is egregious, and it is dangerous, and it hurts me, and my family, and you.
[00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:11.496]  I don't like it.
[00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:16.836]  But they co-opt all your energy and then put it into a call for all these different types of global taxes.
[00:25:16.856 --> 00:25:21.878]  We're going to spend a whole hour on this tomorrow with Paul Watson, and some today.
[00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:32.422]  But, you see, when you read all these AP and MSNBC stories about it, they admit that there are hundreds and hundreds of drugs in every major water supply.
[00:25:33.022 --> 00:25:41.806]  They'll say, well, we only tested for 10 drugs and found all 10, and that means that we would have probably found in past studies, because they only spot check everything else in here.
[00:25:43.112 --> 00:25:45.072]  In some areas, they test for 40.
[00:25:45.132 --> 00:25:45.973]  In some, they test for 10.
[00:25:46.173 --> 00:25:48.933]  And they would find everything they looked for.
[00:25:50.413 --> 00:25:58.795]  Now, when you're reading these articles, and you're reading the results of these cities testing the water, they will give it their scientific name.
[00:25:59.615 --> 00:26:12.758]  Now, I already knew what most of these names meant, but I wanted to double-check last night, so I would enter the name, and it would be serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoride class molecule of the SSR class, Prozac.
[00:26:14.993 --> 00:26:17.095]  And other sub-drugs from the same family.
[00:26:17.115 --> 00:26:18.956]  That would be on the big medical websites.
[00:26:18.996 --> 00:26:19.777]  Or I'd enter another one.
[00:26:19.797 --> 00:26:24.000]  It would say, you know, amphetamine-type derivative used for hyperactivity disorder.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.863]  And it would give like 20 different drugs with the same basic molecule structure.
[00:26:29.404 --> 00:26:32.947]  Or it would be birth control hormones.
[00:26:34.308 --> 00:26:36.129]  Just on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:26:36.449 --> 00:26:39.632]  And then the MSNBC and others said, well...
[00:26:40.626 --> 00:26:45.790]  It's only parts per billion or parts per million, and it's probably not good for you, but at least it's in low levels.
[00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.292]  But I've seen the different EPA studies on this.
[00:26:49.453 --> 00:27:07.886]  If you take, and we've had top EPA toxicologists on admitting this, if you take the hundreds of drugs and the thousands of chemicals, I mean, you test the water, there'll be hundreds of pesticides, hundreds of different weed killers.
[00:27:09.978 --> 00:27:11.379]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:13.040]  Hundreds of different chemicals.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.501]  Thousands of things together.
[00:27:14.541 --> 00:27:15.461]  Go to the EPA website.
[00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:29.729]  It's just thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of herbicides and pesticides and every other chemical you can imagine and runoff from factories and antifreeze.
[00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:31.491]  It's just anything you can imagine.
[00:27:31.571 --> 00:27:32.271]  It's in your water.
[00:27:33.051 --> 00:27:34.032]  It's in the aquifers.
[00:27:34.132 --> 00:27:34.892]  It's in everything.
[00:27:35.213 --> 00:27:39.235]  It's all run down, run off out of the cities, run down out of the factories and
[00:27:40.987 --> 00:27:41.607]  Here's an example.
[00:27:41.627 --> 00:27:49.469]  They'll have you panicking and freaking out over ozone and put all these new taxes on your cars and always jack up the level of the taxes.
[00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:51.889]  That's to regulate and control you, and their own documents admit it.
[00:27:52.229 --> 00:28:03.192]  Meanwhile, they'll have coal-burning plants, and they just took the restrictions off in Texas where they can be as dirty coal as they want, filled with mercury, and then the EPA doesn't make a big deal out of mercury levels skyrocketing.
[00:28:04.272 --> 00:28:09.193]  See, something that actually doesn't hurt you, like carbon dioxide or something like...
[00:28:12.503 --> 00:28:12.983]  Ozone.
[00:28:13.803 --> 00:28:23.686]  They make a big hype over that, but if they went after real chemicals or poisons, it would actually make us change some things, and big industry doesn't want that, so they just hype up inert things.
[00:28:23.786 --> 00:28:24.926]  It's a total fraud.
[00:28:27.287 --> 00:28:35.989]  Now, it's when you add all of these thousands of chemicals and hundreds of drugs up, and yeah, they're billions, parts per billion, but then you add them up together...
[00:28:37.205 --> 00:28:51.261]  It is 3, 4, 6, 8, depending on the city, parts per million of a cocktail of chemicals, hormones, drugs, heavy metals, Grignard reagents...
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.361]  It is a toxic soup.
[00:28:53.401 --> 00:29:13.289]  And so, driving down the road, hearing Dr. Nadel say the tap water is clean, there's conspiracy theorists that say it isn't, man, they're stupid, you don't need to filter your water, just drink the tap water, it's the best stuff, we've got the best water in the world, these backwards people just don't appreciate our great modern sciences.
[00:29:13.429 --> 00:29:13.709]  No!
[00:29:13.869 --> 00:29:16.230]  So, like, oh, we're backwards.
[00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:21.052]  Look, you better be filtering your water, and you better be filtering it repeatedly.
[00:29:21.897 --> 00:29:22.798]  And you better look into it.
[00:29:22.858 --> 00:29:33.286]  Some $50 charcoal filter that just takes out some bad taste, that's better than nothing, folks, but that is literally just reducing it by a few percentage points.
[00:29:34.067 --> 00:29:36.129]  Even reverse osmosis doesn't get it all out.
[00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:38.531]  All right.
[00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:44.856]  We'll come back and get into the secret police armies that are being developed here in the United States.
[00:29:45.736 --> 00:29:46.137]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.886 --> 00:29:52.788]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:54.872]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.813 --> 00:29:58.498]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.863 --> 00:30:03.724]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:30:03.924 --> 00:30:06.984]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:30:07.224 --> 00:30:11.846]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:30:12.186 --> 00:30:14.807]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:30:15.087 --> 00:30:21.929]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.

[00:32:44.965 --> 00:32:46.166]  $15 for UPS Ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:33:03.948 --> 00:33:06.711]  In constant sorrow His name I am the name
[00:33:38.338 --> 00:33:38.778]  All right.
[00:33:39.599 --> 00:33:54.729]  I remember back in the late 90s going to Urban Warfare Drills, getting video from Hebron, Maryland, Swansboro, North Carolina, Oakland, California, South Texas, Kingsville, Texas, Alice, Texas, Corpus Christi, Texas.
[00:33:55.962 --> 00:34:06.331]  With Marines, Army, Delta Force, Night Stalkers out of Fort Campbell, training to take over cities, confiscate our guns.
[00:34:06.972 --> 00:34:14.299]  I had emergency managers on, like Thomas Sanchez over Kingsville, who they contacted and said, this is for martial law takeover drill of the U.S.
[00:34:15.039 --> 00:34:15.900]  I had him on the show.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.482]  I had the police chief of San Antonio on.
[00:34:18.502 --> 00:34:19.383]  They tried to bribe him.
[00:34:19.984 --> 00:34:22.266]  This is a huge covert operation.
[00:34:23.636 --> 00:34:24.937]  Going on for decades.
[00:34:24.977 --> 00:34:29.500]  I learned it really kicked off in about 1984, part of Rex 84.
[00:34:30.781 --> 00:34:34.303]  And we have the Senate hearings, congressional hearings on that now, and I've made three films on it.
[00:34:34.863 --> 00:34:36.384]  So we know this is real.
[00:34:36.424 --> 00:34:37.965]  Now, it's exploded under Bush.
[00:34:39.266 --> 00:34:43.889]  We told you a year plus before it broke in national news about the clergy response teams.
[00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.310]  We got the secret FEMA documents.
[00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.092]  They told them not to release these to anybody, but the pastors did.
[00:34:49.847 --> 00:34:56.669]  Where they're training their flocks without telling them their own government payroll to submit to martial law, go to the FEMA camps, take the inoculations.
[00:34:56.709 --> 00:34:57.790]  We had those passers-on.
[00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:01.931]  And then it came out in mainstream news later, and we have that newscast.
[00:35:03.451 --> 00:35:16.876]  And so when I see stories about InfraGard and 20-plus thousand executives of companies in, quote, key infrastructure, training and being told they're being trained, you know, shoot to kill when martial law comes, well, that's what we...
[00:35:17.985 --> 00:35:21.969]  I've already seen Marines training with role players saying this is for America.
[00:35:21.989 --> 00:35:22.810]  I mean, I have video of it.
[00:35:24.031 --> 00:35:29.997]  And then the FBI came out and attacked Matt Rothschild, who wrote a great story for the Progressive.
[00:35:31.978 --> 00:35:36.182]  And then the headline is, FBI calls InfraGard story patently false.
[00:35:36.222 --> 00:35:40.927]  When you read the story, they admit it's going on, but just say, well, they're not allowed to shoot to kill.
[00:35:43.138 --> 00:35:44.179]  So this is going on.
[00:35:44.219 --> 00:35:46.762]  They're taking over your local governments, your local infrastructures.
[00:35:47.183 --> 00:35:47.743]  It's happening.
[00:35:48.344 --> 00:35:49.805]  And it's very childish, folks.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:52.048]  I had another big Rothschild on.
[00:35:52.348 --> 00:35:56.372]  He actually is one of the heirs to the big British dynasty who's pushing global taxes.
[00:35:56.973 --> 00:36:00.357]  And I was disagreeing with him, and I was still called an enemy of humanity.
[00:36:01.257 --> 00:36:02.257]  For having him on disagreeing.
[00:36:02.297 --> 00:36:03.238]  Now, this guy's a good guy.
[00:36:03.278 --> 00:36:04.618]  The family has thousands of people in it.
[00:36:04.858 --> 00:36:13.620]  It's very childish that I have to even address this fact for some of the people out there, but I just wanted to address it before people have fun with this on YouTube and everywhere else.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:19.602]  We bring you newsmakers, we bring you guests on both sides of the issue, and it's not fair to demonize Mr. Rothschild.
[00:36:19.802 --> 00:36:22.923]  I can't believe I'm even raising this point, but I'm sure you get this a lot, Matt.
[00:36:23.718 --> 00:36:24.359]  I get it a lot.
[00:36:24.379 --> 00:36:24.939]  I get it often.
[00:36:24.979 --> 00:36:25.359]  No problem.
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:26.120]  Okay, good.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.781]  I'm just addressing that up front.
[00:36:27.842 --> 00:36:31.224]  How many people are there that you know of in the Rothschild family?
[00:36:31.745 --> 00:36:32.625]  Oh, I don't know.
[00:36:32.645 --> 00:36:34.887]  There's got to be millions, hundreds of thousands.
[00:36:34.927 --> 00:36:35.268]  I don't know.
[00:36:36.409 --> 00:36:48.919]  I haven't looked at all the family trees and everything, but there are a lot of different groups all around the world with that name, and Lord knows how many of us there are.
[00:36:49.947 --> 00:36:54.315]  But if I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if I was one of the real Rothschilds, I'd be a real Rothschild.
[00:36:54.956 --> 00:36:56.058]  No, people don't understand.
[00:36:56.078 --> 00:36:59.745]  It's just a German translation from Red Shield, isn't it?
[00:37:00.045 --> 00:37:00.406]  Correct.
[00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:01.896]  All right.
[00:37:01.916 --> 00:37:03.257]  Well, there's a lot of Joneses, too.
[00:37:04.877 --> 00:37:07.919]  Hey, I get asked all the time if I'm Jim Jones, so it's all right.
[00:37:09.139 --> 00:37:12.701]  Now, seriously, how did you first learn about InfraGard?
[00:37:12.721 --> 00:37:14.402]  Tell us about some of your scholarly research.
[00:37:14.422 --> 00:37:15.202]  You've done a great job.
[00:37:15.462 --> 00:37:16.563]  And then now these denials.
[00:37:16.623 --> 00:37:18.543]  First breakdown, what InfraGard is.
[00:37:18.564 --> 00:37:21.605]  This particular executive talking about how they're trained to shoot to kill.
[00:37:22.125 --> 00:37:24.166]  I've been sent documents by police that show the same thing.
[00:37:24.186 --> 00:37:26.387]  And then now they're counter to all this.
[00:37:26.707 --> 00:37:27.008]  Sure.
[00:37:27.468 --> 00:37:31.052]  Well, I think a lot of your listeners aren't going to know what InfraGard is.
[00:37:31.132 --> 00:37:36.577]  I didn't know what it was until I got a tip off from another member of the media who said you should check out this organization.
[00:37:36.598 --> 00:37:41.202]  People can find out about it at InfraGard.net.
[00:37:41.382 --> 00:37:43.425]  This is a group that the FBI set up.
[00:37:43.445 --> 00:37:45.367]  I had said in my article 23,000 representatives of business.
[00:37:45.407 --> 00:37:45.807]  Now it's up to 24,000.
[00:37:50.165 --> 00:37:53.509]  There are 86 chapters of InfraGard around the country.
[00:37:53.609 --> 00:38:00.318]  Each chapter has a local business person as president of the chapter and an FBI agent who directs that chapter.
[00:38:01.091 --> 00:38:12.477]  And what they are doing on the one hand is that they're feeding information to the FBI, and on the other hand, the FBI is feeding them secret threat information almost on a daily basis that the public doesn't get.
[00:38:13.018 --> 00:38:22.163]  In fact, you know, the governor of California at one point had to find out from his brother, who was at Morgan Stanley, and a member of InfraGard, that the bridges in California were under threat.
[00:38:22.843 --> 00:38:24.364]  So, that's kind of bizarre.
[00:38:24.404 --> 00:38:46.210]  But the most bizarre thing is that members of InfraGard at local meetings run by the FBI and Homeland Security are told that they have permission in times of an emergency, in times of martial law, which this person told me was going to be when, not if, according to the FBI and Homeland Security, that they have permission to use lethal force to protect their little wing of the infrastructure.
[00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:50.952]  And these are business people that are in oil and chemical and utilities and
[00:38:51.372 --> 00:38:53.413]  Now, here's the problem with all of this.
[00:38:53.713 --> 00:39:00.216]  A, the White House, even the press secretary, Fleischer, admitted two, three years ago now, right before he stepped down,
[00:39:20.535 --> 00:39:24.957]  In a press briefing, they said, why are we seeing all these orange color code alerts?
[00:39:24.997 --> 00:39:26.698]  And he said, well, it's for political aim.
[00:39:26.718 --> 00:39:39.264]  I don't know why he admitted it, but White House memos have come out where they put these out any time a corruption scandal or a bid-rigging scandal or some bad news comes out, suddenly Al-Qaeda is going to kill us all.
[00:39:39.304 --> 00:39:41.606]  We know that they're using this to scare locals.
[00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:44.487]  It's creating kind of little secret police units.
[00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:53.461]  Anytime, as a citizen, if you really saw somebody about to blow up your power plant, you do have the right to stop that criminal activity.
[00:39:53.481 --> 00:40:00.585]  If you see somebody trying to rob a bank and they're running out with a bag of money, you're not going to go to jail if you draw down on them with your concealed carry and shoot them.
[00:40:01.186 --> 00:40:06.769]  But it is the secretiveness to all of this and then now the denial that makes it even more creepy.
[00:40:07.735 --> 00:40:15.938]  Well, and the denial was that they didn't really flat out deny that the FBI is telling InfraGard members that they have the right to shoot to kill.
[00:40:16.238 --> 00:40:18.359]  This was the exact language the FBI used.
[00:40:18.719 --> 00:40:24.861]  InfraGard members have no extraordinary powers and no greater right to shoot to kill than other civilians.
[00:40:24.921 --> 00:40:25.401]  That's right.
[00:40:25.701 --> 00:40:27.422]  I don't take that as a denial, really.
[00:40:27.942 --> 00:40:33.407]  And in fact, they're actually stating the law, but they are making these their own little special toadies.
[00:40:33.788 --> 00:40:41.155]  I mean, why doesn't the government tell the general public that, hey, we need you and you've got a right if you see somebody running around, you know, about to kill people?
[00:40:41.435 --> 00:40:42.856]  I mean, obviously we have that right.
[00:40:42.876 --> 00:40:43.937]  It doesn't come from government.
[00:40:44.197 --> 00:40:46.760]  It's an organic right that springs from common law.
[00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:58.138]  Well, you know, it disturbs me that the government is creating this kind of superior class of people, this business class of people who get all this information on threats before we get it.
[00:40:58.158 --> 00:40:59.099]  Well, that's fascism.
[00:40:59.119 --> 00:40:59.760]  Hitler did that.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:08.387]  Yeah, and they are empowering these people or winking at them to use lethal force in times of emergency.
[00:41:08.846 --> 00:41:21.354]  I mean, and to what extent are those people going to, you know, exploit that and do something that is just absolutely crazy and give no, you know, they could see someone coming to their place of business that they don't know, but maybe they think the person is a threat.
[00:41:21.374 --> 00:41:22.855]  Maybe the person isn't a threat at all.
[00:41:23.744 --> 00:41:25.807]  And then they're going to shoot that person?
[00:41:25.847 --> 00:41:28.691]  I mean, I think we're supposed to have law enforcement for that purpose.
[00:41:28.711 --> 00:41:32.876]  Well, I was told ten years ago that Walmart was involved in shadow government.
[00:41:32.936 --> 00:41:40.005]  Since then, it's come out in mainstream news that there are five FBI agents in Bentonville, Arkansas, at their main computer network.
[00:41:41.129 --> 00:41:41.930]  24 hours a day.
[00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:53.195]  I have been told by Special Forces that Walmart will be used and their distribution centers will be used as holding facilities and emergency distribution centers for inoculations.
[00:41:53.515 --> 00:41:57.637]  And then lo and behold, the last two years, Walmart has admitted they're involved.
[00:41:57.677 --> 00:42:00.638]  And so this is a great way to take over the society.
[00:42:00.658 --> 00:42:02.439]  They're using the FEMA emergency centers.
[00:42:03.558 --> 00:42:03.758]  I think?
[00:42:27.297 --> 00:42:28.357]  I was.
[00:42:29.258 --> 00:42:47.508]  I heard about this after I finished my story, but this broke in Louisiana with a very mainstream TV network that broke the story, that they interviewed some members of the clergy who were in these so-called clergy response teams.
[00:42:47.868 --> 00:42:50.651]  They were being told what to do in times of martial law.
[00:42:50.671 --> 00:42:58.760]  They were being told what chapter and verse from the Bible to read to their flock to tell people to calm down and wait until the whole thing is over.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.962]  That's what they're instructed to do.
[00:43:01.201 --> 00:43:15.337]  Boy, I tell you, did you see the fact that Tommy Franks was being paid $455,000 a year for two years when he retired in 2004 to go around and tell people that it's sad, but martial law is what we need after the next attack?
[00:43:15.377 --> 00:43:18.561]  But then it came out he was being paid by the White House to say that.
[00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:20.283]  That's a little creepy, isn't it, Matt?
[00:43:20.803 --> 00:43:24.846]  Didn't realize he was being paid, but his comment didn't get enough attention in most parts.
[00:43:24.926 --> 00:43:34.474]  I mean, he did say after he retired, this is the guy who led the ground forces into Iraq, that if we're attacked again by terrorists with weapons of mass destruction, we're going to have to put the Constitution aside.
[00:43:34.514 --> 00:43:37.556]  And then there's Wayne Downing of the National Security Council.
[00:43:37.576 --> 00:43:41.059]  He's dead now, but he was kind of Lisa Rice's deputy for a couple years.
[00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:44.442]  And when he retired, he said, we're going to have to declare martial law someday.
[00:43:45.789 --> 00:44:00.297]  Again, is there any doubt in your mind as a journalist, Matt Rothschild, that they are doing everything they can to try to prepare the police, the corporate leaders to stand up and say everything, the pastors, it's okay, go along with the martial law takeover?
[00:44:01.357 --> 00:44:10.542]  I've got to think that not only are the blueprints on the drawing boards, but they're pursuing and lining people up for what they need to do if Bush comes to shove.
[00:44:11.135 --> 00:44:20.143]  Did you see the San Francisco Chronicle article by the former congressman three weeks ago finally admitting, Houston Chronicle also, that they are building camps for the American people?
[00:44:20.884 --> 00:44:23.806]  Well, is this the Halliburton story about detention camps?
[00:44:24.207 --> 00:44:37.158]  Yes, but then they expanded into PDD 51 that says Bush is above Congress and now a dictator, and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act actually says for domestic operations against a mass revolt.
[00:44:38.232 --> 00:44:50.318]  Yeah, well, I think this May 9, 2007 National Security Presidential Directive 51, which is entitled National Continuity Policy, I mean, people should look that up and see what powers Bush is grabbing for himself.
[00:44:51.969 --> 00:44:52.850]  Well, here's the problem.
[00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.932]  We know that they're pushing the Democrats.
[00:44:54.952 --> 00:44:56.294]  They're pushing Hillary right now.
[00:44:56.714 --> 00:44:59.357]  No doubt Diebold's cheating Obama.
[00:44:59.377 --> 00:45:00.378]  That's been coming out.
[00:45:00.418 --> 00:45:02.821]  But, I mean, look, this is bigger than Bush.
[00:45:02.921 --> 00:45:05.424]  Or do you agree, Matt, that it's just continuing?
[00:45:05.684 --> 00:45:08.127]  This infrastructure didn't start last week.
[00:45:08.167 --> 00:45:09.248]  It's not going to go away in a year.
[00:45:10.117 --> 00:45:26.146]  No, I mean, InfraGard itself started in 1996, so that was under the Clinton administration, and it's just been mushrooming ever since, but it's going to, that infrastructure, those plans for what's going to happen under an emergency in a martial law situation will be there after Bush and Cheney leave office.
[00:45:26.346 --> 00:45:27.027]  Now that's the key.
[00:45:28.502 --> 00:45:32.146]  And if you look at it under Reagan, it was, say, one inch tall.
[00:45:32.606 --> 00:45:37.452]  Now, literally, now it's the size of a redwood sequoia in Northern California.
[00:45:37.472 --> 00:45:39.955]  I mean, now it's everywhere.
[00:45:39.975 --> 00:45:43.659]  And they've got half a million and they're going to double that this year.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.441]  Truck drivers spying on everybody.
[00:45:45.702 --> 00:45:46.623]  I mean, this is getting bad.
[00:45:47.452 --> 00:45:50.155]  Yeah, and why isn't Congress going to hold hearings on this?
[00:45:50.776 --> 00:45:55.260]  Why don't they say not only what's up with InfraGard, but what are the plans for martial law?
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:46:00.065]  What's going to happen to our civil liberties or our democratic system of government in times of martial law?
[00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:06.652]  I mean, this is a big, big issue that's looming out there, and our congressional oversight is just not happening.
[00:46:06.852 --> 00:46:13.834]  Well, I'll tell you, the election laws are written to where they can selectively enforce against anybody, even if you try to be above board.
[00:46:14.334 --> 00:46:20.735]  So even the good guys know if they buck too much, they'll have an election commission investigation.
[00:46:20.755 --> 00:46:29.257]  I know most of them have, at least in their 20 years in Congress, gotten seduced by a set-up, by a lovely lady at a bar.
[00:46:29.857 --> 00:46:32.238]  And so most of them are compromised.
[00:46:32.778 --> 00:46:35.420]  And sometimes, you know, the Bush administration won't give them information.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:43.826]  I know Pete DeFazio in Oregon there was trying to find out more information about National Security Presidential Directive 51, and they just told him he couldn't have it.
[00:46:44.086 --> 00:46:55.434]  And then later, you're right, Mr. Rothschild, then later, the chairman asked for it, and they said, no, you may have the highest congressional clearance, but Congress isn't allowed to see what we're going to do during an emergency.
[00:46:56.215 --> 00:46:58.056]  Yeah, so, you know, there's your answer.
[00:46:58.196 --> 00:47:00.198]  I mean, the system of government is going to go.
[00:47:01.098 --> 00:47:01.799]  What are we going to do?
[00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:02.699]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[00:47:02.979 --> 00:47:03.760]  They've built camps.
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:04.681]  They're training the police.
[00:47:05.101 --> 00:47:11.726]  Now all these people on Fox are saying if you're an anti-war protester or a 9-11 truther, you should be, quote, sent to a secret prison.
[00:47:12.046 --> 00:47:13.547]  The military needs to be used against us.
[00:47:13.567 --> 00:47:14.748]  I don't know if you've seen those reports.
[00:47:14.768 --> 00:47:16.950]  They're now got a talking point saying that.
[00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:20.793]  That lets me know that there may be seriously contemplating going for it.
[00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:28.234]  Well, I think, first of all, that your listeners and other citizens in this country should be very worried about what these plans are.
[00:47:28.274 --> 00:47:33.878]  And secondly, we need to demand of our Congress people that they, you know, hold hearings, demand to hold hearings.
[00:47:34.298 --> 00:47:36.840]  And if Bush isn't going to give them information, they should go to the courts.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.742]  And if Bush still is going to stiff arm them, they should impeach him.
[00:47:39.782 --> 00:47:41.123]  I think he should be impeached anyway.
[00:47:41.183 --> 00:47:42.384]  But this is just another reason.
[00:47:42.424 --> 00:47:50.289]  We need to get to the bottom of this, not just to hold Bush and Cheney accountable, but to dismantle this repressive apparatus that's been put in place.
[00:47:51.414 --> 00:47:53.675]  And folks, it's the most robust we've ever seen.
[00:47:53.755 --> 00:47:58.276]  The size of it already dwarfs what the Nazis had via infrastructure.
[00:47:58.756 --> 00:48:04.118]  And this is a White House that's written memos saying that they can torture children sexually in front of their parents.
[00:48:04.798 --> 00:48:07.599]  So, I mean, there's no doubt they're trying to go for broke.
[00:48:08.723 --> 00:48:12.965]  Yeah, I don't think we should have any illusions that, you know, Bush and Cheney are four square behind this thing.
[00:48:13.446 --> 00:48:15.867]  I mean, look at what they've done to our Constitution so far.
[00:48:15.887 --> 00:48:17.508]  I mean, they're not going to stop at anything.
[00:48:17.588 --> 00:48:24.352]  But I do think this is an issue that demands more mainstream media attention and demands more congressional attention.
[00:48:24.772 --> 00:48:28.594]  Otherwise, you know, they're going to declare martial law someday and it'll be too late.
[00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:32.933]  Well, citizens need, you know, we overthrew the Patriot Act here in Austin.
[00:48:33.514 --> 00:48:35.956]  I don't know, 700, 800 cities, five states have done it.
[00:48:36.276 --> 00:48:37.137]  We need to keep going.
[00:48:37.177 --> 00:48:38.838]  We need to go to city councils.
[00:48:39.218 --> 00:48:42.641]  Read these news articles out of the San Francisco Chronicle, because that sounds credible.
[00:48:42.901 --> 00:48:45.223]  San Francisco Chronicle says they're setting up a dictatorship.
[00:48:45.503 --> 00:48:46.724]  You know, point this out.
[00:48:47.025 --> 00:48:47.985]  Heighten awareness.
[00:48:49.186 --> 00:48:52.089]  And, you know, even Bob Woodward last year, was it?
[00:48:52.657 --> 00:48:55.760]  A university down in San Antonio has said he's worried about this.
[00:48:56.061 --> 00:49:01.246]  That is the good news, though, isn't it, Matt, that a lot of really heavy hitters are now talking about this?
[00:49:01.747 --> 00:49:05.711]  Yeah, the only other one that I remember really talking about was Ted Koppel.
[00:49:05.731 --> 00:49:11.397]  He actually had a show on what's going to happen if there's martial law or whether there's a serious chance of it.
[00:49:11.437 --> 00:49:13.239]  And the scary thing was he had Democratic...
[00:49:13.679 --> 00:49:14.400]  See, it's real simple.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:20.626]  As PNAC said, as the Vice President wrote, they're not going to be able to keep attacking all these nations and expanding unless there's terror attacks.
[00:49:38.457 --> 00:49:40.738]  And then lo and behold, magically there's terror attacks.
[00:49:40.798 --> 00:49:42.059]  Boy, isn't that convenient for them, Matt?
[00:49:42.499 --> 00:49:43.720]  Well, they sure seized on it.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:44.941]  There's no question about that.
[00:49:44.961 --> 00:49:45.881]  I mean, they seized on 9-11.
[00:49:46.241 --> 00:50:00.689]  I mean, I don't buy into the idea that Cheney and Bush were behind 9-11, but I think there were those plans on the shelf ready to be taken down as soon as the United States was attacked because, you know, the Project for a New American Century said it's going to take another, what?
[00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:05.071]  It's going to take another huge attack, another Pearl Harbor attack,
[00:50:05.416 --> 00:50:09.758]  To get what they wanted, which is a $500 billion Pentagon budget, which they have right now.
[00:50:09.798 --> 00:50:20.644]  Matt, they've got White House chief counsel saying they can crush children's generals with pliers, but you don't think they'd, at least at some level, be involved?
[00:50:20.664 --> 00:50:25.806]  I don't think they were competent enough to be involved to carry the thing off, frankly.
[00:50:26.066 --> 00:50:28.067]  But they're competent enough to set up this whole grid.
[00:50:28.687 --> 00:50:31.569]  Well, they're setting up the grid that's just a bureaucracy in motion right now.
[00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:33.949]  And, you know, it started with Clinton.
[00:50:34.009 --> 00:50:35.050]  It's going on forward.
[00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:37.891]  And it went back to Reagan with FEMA, as you pointed out.
[00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:39.231]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:41.332]  Matthew Rothschild is our guest.
[00:50:41.372 --> 00:50:42.892]  He's an award-winning journalist.
[00:50:42.932 --> 00:50:46.233]  He writes for the Progressive, progressive.org.
[00:50:46.493 --> 00:50:48.974]  And he's done a great series of stories on InfraGard.
[00:50:49.014 --> 00:50:50.854]  Final segment with our guest straight ahead.
[00:50:50.874 --> 00:50:56.316]  We'll give out any other websites or info he wants to talk about and talk about more ideas on how to stop this, get his take when we get back.
[00:51:02.032 --> 00:51:04.573]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:51:04.893 --> 00:51:06.173]  Loose Change, Final Cut.

[00:51:11.975 --> 00:51:13.395]  America, Freedom to Fascism.

[00:52:01.642 --> 00:52:04.584]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:52:04.744 --> 00:52:09.928]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:52:10.269 --> 00:52:15.553]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:52:15.973 --> 00:52:17.114]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:52:17.475 --> 00:52:26.322]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:11.835]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:53:12.275 --> 00:53:19.123]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:26.268]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:53:26.588 --> 00:53:28.189]  There are no reported side effects.

[00:53:51.445 --> 00:53:53.607]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:53:53.627 --> 00:53:56.049]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.681]  Our guest is Matthew Rothschild, journalist.
[00:54:18.442 --> 00:54:26.706]  Look, this is about impregnating the leadership of this country and private industry with secret police cronyism and paranoia.
[00:54:27.727 --> 00:54:30.849]  You know, leave the borders wide open, but look under every bed, every closet.
[00:54:31.409 --> 00:54:35.511]  There's terrorists everywhere, and then in all these FBI and federal programs and local programs,
[00:54:36.221 --> 00:54:38.883]  Within a year of the program, it starts out sounding reasonable.
[00:54:38.903 --> 00:54:41.184]  You know, we're looking for guys around the perimeter of the power plant.
[00:54:41.704 --> 00:54:44.286]  Then it moves into the library, spout what people are reading.
[00:54:45.306 --> 00:54:51.050]  And then they move into, quote, fighting crime and this whole tattletale society.
[00:54:52.311 --> 00:54:59.175]  Matt Rothschild, getting back into 9-11, and you can look this up for yourself, but everything I've brought up you've known about, so you sound like you're pretty well informed on all this.
[00:54:59.695 --> 00:55:01.316]  You probably know more than I do in some facets.
[00:55:02.108 --> 00:55:03.869]  But, you know, Bush had 44,000 U.S.
[00:55:04.229 --> 00:55:05.330]  troops, 18,000 U.S.
[00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:15.236]  troops in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, four of the stands, ready to invade, two aircraft carrier task forces.
[00:55:16.037 --> 00:55:22.041]  On September 10th, he signed launch orders for a week later to launch the attack on Afghanistan.
[00:55:23.443 --> 00:55:24.424]  Well, I haven't heard that part, but I don't...
[00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:48.024]  To say that Bush and Cheney were behind 9-11, you have to assume that thousands of people were in on this conspiracy.
[00:55:48.304 --> 00:55:49.904]  And then how far do you go?
[00:55:49.964 --> 00:55:53.085]  Did Cheney tell people to plant bombs under the Twin Towers?
[00:55:53.786 --> 00:55:55.946]  How were they able to go in and do that?
[00:55:55.966 --> 00:55:57.567]  See, Matt, we don't know.
[00:55:57.807 --> 00:55:58.807]  We know they lied to us.
[00:55:58.827 --> 00:56:02.248]  We know they basically appointed and ran the commission through Zelikow.
[00:56:02.829 --> 00:56:06.730]  And we know that their PNAC documents said, boy, this would sure help if this...
[00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:11.151]  If this happened, and they had the Manhattan Project, that was secret.
[00:56:11.191 --> 00:56:13.392]  It would only take actually a few hundred people.
[00:56:15.073 --> 00:56:16.073]  Again, I'm asking you the question.
[00:56:16.133 --> 00:56:25.736]  It's like if a building catches on fire, and people report that the fire department was already out front when the fire started, you'd ask, why was the fire department there?
[00:56:26.511 --> 00:56:27.231]  Well, I don't know.
[00:56:27.831 --> 00:56:32.173]  I didn't see the stories on Turkmenistan in that order.
[00:56:32.513 --> 00:56:37.254]  But certainly the Bush administration was planning what to do about Afghanistan anyway.
[00:56:37.994 --> 00:56:46.097]  And I don't think they needed a 9-11 to have plans on the border, maybe even orders about what to do about Afghanistan short of 9-11.
[00:56:46.157 --> 00:56:47.457]  But, you know, I'll look at that.
[00:56:47.497 --> 00:56:50.318]  I have done a lot of studying on this 9-11 question.
[00:56:50.358 --> 00:56:53.519]  I'm just not convinced that, you know, there was a conspiracy.
[00:56:53.579 --> 00:56:54.800]  Certainly they seized on 9-11.
[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:56.180]  That's without question.
[00:56:56.630 --> 00:57:00.533]  Have you seen all the Republican memos and editorials saying we need another 9-11?
[00:57:01.953 --> 00:57:04.115]  Well, I mean, idiots will say idiotic things.
[00:57:05.816 --> 00:57:07.117]  That doesn't prove anything to me.
[00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:12.520]  I mean, you know, how foolish is that for someone to say after 3,000 people were killed here?
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.942]  That doesn't mean that Bush did it the first time, either.
[00:57:15.222 --> 00:57:16.643]  So you are aware of those stories, though?
[00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:17.423]  Yeah, I saw that.
[00:57:17.723 --> 00:57:21.546]  Okay, well, let's expand on that, now that we've gotten off into this issue just briefly.
[00:57:22.787 --> 00:57:23.107]  Because...
[00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:31.022]  How did the CIA run drills of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center and Pentagon at the exact same time that morning?
[00:57:31.043 --> 00:57:31.524]  Were you aware of that?
[00:57:32.185 --> 00:57:32.886]  I was, yeah.
[00:57:33.186 --> 00:57:35.708]  Just another accident, another strange snap?
[00:57:35.748 --> 00:57:38.611]  Well, it's strange, but it doesn't prove the case.
[00:57:38.651 --> 00:57:39.812]  I mean, it's curious, no doubt.
[00:57:39.832 --> 00:57:41.733]  Well, there are about a hundred other curious things.
[00:57:41.953 --> 00:57:47.338]  Yeah, I know, but I mean, what then, you know, you've got to take the conspiracy theories one at a time.
[00:57:47.358 --> 00:57:49.800]  You know, what happened to that plane that was supposed to hit the Pentagon?
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:50.881]  It didn't hit the Pentagon.
[00:57:50.901 --> 00:57:52.923]  Then what happened to the passengers who were on the plane?
[00:57:53.083 --> 00:57:55.845]  I mean, the conspiracy theories themselves have a whole mess of them.
[00:57:55.985 --> 00:57:59.267]  Well, exactly, because there's millions of people with their own theories.
[00:57:59.327 --> 00:58:00.647]  We just know the official story.
[00:58:00.667 --> 00:58:05.490]  I mean, it's kind of like if I've got an attic and I smell rotten meat up there.
[00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:06.530]  It's going to be a squirrel.
[00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:07.931]  It's going to be a possum.
[00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:09.452]  It's going to be a raccoon.
[00:58:09.972 --> 00:58:12.313]  God forbid it's going to be a cat that crawled in there and died.
[00:58:12.793 --> 00:58:18.096]  I know when I open up that trap door and go up into the attic, there's going to be a rotten something with maggots all over it, okay?
[00:58:18.942 --> 00:58:21.444]  We're on a ride in something in this administration.
[00:58:21.484 --> 00:58:22.304]  I can agree with you there.
[00:58:22.404 --> 00:58:23.625]  Tell you what, 70-second break.
[00:58:23.665 --> 00:58:28.929]  Only five more minutes with you and your solution ideas you've got for this martial law grid that's going into place.
[00:58:29.369 --> 00:58:30.670]  Matt Rothschild's our guest.
[00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:36.114]  He writes for the Progressive, and he's done some amazing reports on InfraGard, and for that we thank him.
[00:58:36.434 --> 00:58:38.635]  We'll be right back after a 70-second break.
[00:58:39.096 --> 00:58:40.236]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.269 --> 00:58:48.630]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.132 --> 00:58:58.792]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.432 --> 00:59:00.512]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.212 --> 00:59:02.332]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.953 --> 00:59:03.793]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.533 --> 00:59:05.493]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.093 --> 00:59:09.814]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.294 --> 00:59:14.355]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:18.322]  The dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[00:59:18.402 --> 00:59:25.385]  More details on that coming up as more and more horrible financial news comes out as the earnings reports proliferate.
[00:59:27.286 --> 00:59:34.149]  We'll get into every major city with masses of drugs and other cocktails of chemicals and herbicides, pesticides.
[00:59:34.169 --> 00:59:35.010]  We'll be covering that.
[00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:39.412]  Dr. Dina Delce's conspiracy, none of it exists.
[00:59:39.432 --> 00:59:41.953]  The water's delicious and shouldn't even try to clean it.
[00:59:43.347 --> 00:59:49.972]  And we've got about three or four minutes left with an individual who is a prolific, award-winning journalist, writes for The Progressive, progressive.org.
[00:59:49.992 --> 00:59:55.836]  We've got a clip up on infowars.com of him a few weeks ago on Democracy Now!, really laying it all out.
[00:59:55.856 --> 00:59:58.418]  I suggest you spend some time to go watch that.
[00:59:59.299 --> 01:00:12.628]  But in closing, sir, and we appreciate your time, your ideas about how to turn this around, obviously educate the public about this grid, but other ideas you've got about stopping this huge military-industrial complex crisis
[01:00:13.431 --> 01:00:19.395]  System that's basically running the red light cameras, the face scanning cameras, the thumb scanning for school lunches.
[01:00:19.456 --> 01:00:22.157]  I mean, it's just a whole prison-type grid going in.
[01:00:22.198 --> 01:00:22.778]  How do we stop it?
[01:00:23.431 --> 01:00:24.672]  Well, we've got to stand up for our rights.
[01:00:24.692 --> 01:00:25.733]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:00:25.973 --> 01:00:27.914]  And I think you had a good idea earlier on.
[01:00:27.934 --> 01:00:33.298]  We can start locally at our city councils, at our county boards, and even with our states.
[01:00:33.539 --> 01:00:45.628]  There's something called a Bill of Rights Defense Committee around the country, and they've helped more than 400 cities and towns say they're not going to let the Patriot Act tell them what to do when it's asking for unconstitutional powers.
[01:00:45.688 --> 01:00:46.108]  So I think
[01:00:46.528 --> 01:00:49.070]  That's one way to organize and educate people on this.
[01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:52.553]  Another is to demand of our legislators that they hold hearings on this subject.
[01:00:53.354 --> 01:01:02.681]  And we've got to keep their feet to the fire, otherwise the government is going to continue with its plans to tear up our Constitution even more than it's torn up already.
[01:01:02.981 --> 01:01:05.983]  We've got a few champions, love them or hate them.
[01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:08.004]  Waxman might do this.
[01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:09.725]  Paul has called for it.
[01:01:09.805 --> 01:01:12.286]  So has Dennis Kucinich.
[01:01:12.626 --> 01:01:14.427]  Any other ideas in the House or Senate?
[01:01:14.827 --> 01:01:17.509]  Because, you know, obviously approach one of them and have them bring it up.
[01:01:18.129 --> 01:01:21.531]  Yeah, my senator, Russ Feingold, is real good on civil liberties issues.
[01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:25.533]  Chris Dodd out in Connecticut is good on them, and I think people should pressure them as well.
[01:01:25.873 --> 01:01:30.656]  I've tried to get this in front of Feingold, and next time I talk to him, I'm going to try to ask him, too.
[01:01:32.051 --> 01:01:35.756]  Well, you know, there's still kind of that kook factor of, oh, there's a secret government.
[01:01:36.077 --> 01:01:41.624]  You've got to talk about it when it's now in mainstream newspapers that are calmly reporting how there's FEMA camps.
[01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:42.946]  I mean, this is big.
[01:01:43.718 --> 01:01:51.442]  Yeah, and I think that's a real problem that people, you know, they're kind of embarrassed to bring up the subject of InfraGard or shoot to kill under martial law.
[01:01:51.462 --> 01:01:53.644]  I mean, the first time I heard it, I thought the guy was crazy.
[01:01:54.004 --> 01:01:59.887]  But then, you know, he showed me his InfraGard card, and then I talked to other people in this organization who've been told the same thing.
[01:01:59.907 --> 01:02:02.368]  I mean, at some point, you've got to say, hey, there's something going on here.
[01:02:02.468 --> 01:02:08.952]  And then the FBI puts out a correction, but then admits, yeah, we told them they could shoot to kill, but, you know, everybody can, you know.
[01:02:09.572 --> 01:02:12.494]  Yeah, that's not exactly blowing a hole in the story.
[01:02:13.681 --> 01:02:20.786]  No, it's not, but you notice their headline says, oh, this is pure bull, and then they admit, oh, it's actually all true, but his interpretation is wrong.
[01:02:21.146 --> 01:02:24.928]  Yeah, patently false is what they said, but they couldn't dispute a single fact.
[01:02:24.968 --> 01:02:28.671]  They couldn't refute a single allegation that I made in the story.
[01:02:30.658 --> 01:02:48.026]  Well, Matt, I know it's all true, because I have been to the urban warfare drills and watched Marines, where they hire hundreds of role players, they hire all the local actors, it doesn't matter if it's New York or California, and they sit there saying, I'm an American, no, not the camp, and they let me videotape mock interrogations where they say, where are you from?
[01:02:48.086 --> 01:02:49.047]  I'm from San Francisco.
[01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:50.367]  Where'd you get the helmet?
[01:02:50.387 --> 01:02:51.228]  Where'd you get the gun?
[01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.509]  I mean, that was ten years ago.
[01:02:55.129 --> 01:03:02.336]  Yeah, and I think we have to recognize that they're planning for this, and we have to demand that they stop planning for it, and we've got to assert our rights before it's too late.
[01:03:02.657 --> 01:03:07.242]  We need a congressional study or some think tank study on how much has been spent on all this.
[01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:09.464]  Well, that's another way to look at it.
[01:03:09.484 --> 01:03:10.925]  Where are they getting the money for this?
[01:03:11.005 --> 01:03:18.373]  I mean, there are these black operations that the CIA and the FBI and the NSA are doing, and why shouldn't we as citizens know about them?
[01:03:19.492 --> 01:03:20.113]  Absolutely.
[01:03:20.433 --> 01:03:24.435]  Matt Rothschild, we really appreciate your contributions to all this and the research you've done.
[01:03:24.736 --> 01:03:26.917]  Any other websites or personal site you want to plug?
[01:03:27.357 --> 01:03:34.882]  Yeah, people should go to InfraGardMembers.org to find out more about this or InfraGard.net and go to our website, Progressive.org.
[01:03:35.723 --> 01:03:36.083]  All right.
[01:03:36.143 --> 01:03:37.364]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[01:03:37.824 --> 01:03:38.285]  My pleasure.
[01:03:38.745 --> 01:03:40.166]  There goes Matthew Rothschild.
[01:03:40.526 --> 01:03:45.850]  We'll come back and into a ton of news, your phone calls, and another huge guest coming up in 55 minutes.
[01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:47.451]  The transmission continues.
[01:03:53.934 --> 01:04:01.877]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:04:02.337 --> 01:04:05.438]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[01:04:05.458 --> 01:04:08.939]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.
[01:04:09.299 --> 01:04:14.121]  Just visit HerbalHealer.com and shop online or request a free catalog.

[01:04:36.776 --> 01:04:37.656]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:05:06.583]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:05:06.983 --> 01:05:13.725]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:05:14.065 --> 01:05:14.566]  We're good to go.
[01:05:14.626 --> 01:05:15.607]  We're good to go.
[01:05:34.469 --> 01:05:44.592]  Be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[01:05:44.972 --> 01:05:47.232]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:05:47.593 --> 01:05:52.914]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:05:53.470 --> 01:06:01.873]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:06:02.173 --> 01:06:07.255]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[01:06:07.295 --> 01:06:07.855]  and Canada.
[01:06:08.155 --> 01:06:14.637]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC free.
[01:06:15.197 --> 01:06:18.939]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org and order today.
[01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.910]  We're good to go.
[01:06:39.031 --> 01:06:39.311]  I think?
[01:06:58.288 --> 01:06:58.968]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.608 --> 01:07:00.649]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.369 --> 01:07:02.489]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:03.950]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:06.211]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:10.132]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.452 --> 01:07:14.553]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:29.087]  We're good to go.
[01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:04.886]  We want to be fair to regular listeners as well, and generally it's just first come, first serve.
[01:08:04.906 --> 01:08:05.246]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:05.727 --> 01:08:06.287]  Okay.
[01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:17.775]  I want to get into the drugs and the water and a bunch of other important news that I have here in the stack in front of me today.
[01:08:19.376 --> 01:08:23.999]  But before I do that, I want to thank the audience first.
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:25.420]  And I want to...
[01:08:26.064 --> 01:08:29.525]  Give you my thoughts on a couple issues, and then maybe get your thoughts.
[01:08:31.986 --> 01:08:38.308]  I am extremely frustrated, and I've shared this with you, in that there are a hundred films I want to make.
[01:08:41.309 --> 01:08:52.073]  There are hundreds of subjects that I want to detail, and there's so much going on and so much happening that I can never even get to 5% of what I want to cover.
[01:08:53.027 --> 01:08:55.028]  Making a film takes me eight, nine months.
[01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:59.031]  I'm trying to beef up my operation and put one out every six months.
[01:09:00.292 --> 01:09:04.855]  Incredible research, time, effort, shooting the footage, paying people, goes into it.
[01:09:05.116 --> 01:09:05.876]  We're not complaining.
[01:09:05.916 --> 01:09:09.439]  It's just one operation can't do it all, especially a small one.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:22.508]  But it has been very heartening and has lessened my frustration and really buoyed me, made my spirits rise, and it's so exciting to recognize what you're doing.
[01:09:26.198 --> 01:09:35.420]  And what's happening is there are more than a hundred major upload video platforms like YouTube, Google, LiveLeak, BlipTV, the list goes on and on.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.401]  Sites that get millions and millions of views every week or in some cases every hour.
[01:09:43.801 --> 01:09:52.283]  And my information, my films, my weekly TV reports, the TV in-studio report, the videotaping we do of the Sunday show,
[01:09:54.349 --> 01:09:59.677]  You are taking those, and you're taking the most important parts that you believe are the most important.
[01:09:59.697 --> 01:10:01.159]  And I believe your judgment's even better than mine.
[01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:02.261]  It's incredible what you're doing.
[01:10:02.881 --> 01:10:04.143]  And you're adding documents.
[01:10:04.163 --> 01:10:05.205]  You're adding photos.
[01:10:05.245 --> 01:10:09.291]  You're adding news stories over my comments, over my statements.
[01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:19.455]  And basically, it's becoming little mini documentaries, and they're getting tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands, and in some cases, millions of views.
[01:10:19.635 --> 01:10:21.677]  And now I've been tracking it as best I can.
[01:10:22.257 --> 01:10:29.161]  It is exponentially growing with hundreds of new videos every day that I'm running into.
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.702]  An example is this Alex Jones question in reality.
[01:10:34.742 --> 01:10:40.767]  It's just the first eight minutes or so of my TV show two weeks ago that I put up for prisonplanet.tv members.
[01:10:40.807 --> 01:10:43.028]  The reason you still want to be a member is it's in super high quality.
[01:10:43.369 --> 01:11:01.342]  Then they take it, and then they added video and images and documents over it where I'm talking about fluoride and the government admitting it destroys your kidneys, hypothalamus, pituitary, bone fractures, actually creates chlorosis, rots holes in your teeth from the inside out, how they admit that children shouldn't be drinking it.
[01:11:02.586 --> 01:11:13.271]  I don't have time to do three or four hours of TV a week, which we do, and then have the staff or the money to have them put images and documents over every single piece of it.
[01:11:15.311 --> 01:11:21.274]  You are now doing that, and it's having devastating effect on the New World Order.
[01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:29.414]  And people all day, all night, email me, call me, post, saying, thank you, thank you, oh, you're so great, you're so wonderful.
[01:11:29.954 --> 01:11:32.956]  I'm only one average person who became aware of this and decided to fight it.
[01:11:34.336 --> 01:11:39.559]  But by joining together, you have just done amazing things.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.682]  There are millions and millions of people a day, and it's growing exponentially.
[01:11:44.802 --> 01:11:45.843]  The graph goes straight up.
[01:11:46.964 --> 01:11:52.567]  Who are now seeing the work you have done taking my work and integrating my work with others.
[01:11:53.433 --> 01:11:55.534]  You're doing it with a lot of people, and that's wonderful.
[01:11:56.714 --> 01:12:01.836]  And I just want to tell you, please continue.
[01:12:02.817 --> 01:12:05.658]  There are too many of you for me to ever thank you all.
[01:12:05.718 --> 01:12:12.080]  So many nights I print out the different YouTube accounts and the different people that are doing it.
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:13.621]  Sometimes I thank you.
[01:12:13.641 --> 01:12:14.741]  I don't thank you enough.
[01:12:15.261 --> 01:12:16.502]  I want to thank all of you.
[01:12:16.522 --> 01:12:19.083]  I want to thank you for...
[01:12:21.411 --> 01:12:22.191]  We're good to go.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.060]  Light years ahead of everybody else in this movement.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.161]  We are surging.
[01:12:47.581 --> 01:12:49.481]  We reached escape velocity.
[01:12:49.981 --> 01:12:51.541]  Left the atmosphere a long time ago.
[01:12:51.581 --> 01:12:53.302]  And we're at Alpha Centuries, folks.
[01:12:53.722 --> 01:12:55.882]  We're in another part of the galaxy right now.
[01:12:56.762 --> 01:12:59.643]  I mean, we have just warped past everybody.
[01:13:00.463 --> 01:13:02.183]  And it is daunting.
[01:13:03.123 --> 01:13:04.924]  It is also ego-crushing.
[01:13:06.344 --> 01:13:11.925]  It is ego-crushing to realize that millions of people are analyzing everything I'm saying.
[01:13:12.045 --> 01:13:12.385]  It is...
[01:13:13.063 --> 01:13:13.703]  It is humbling.
[01:13:13.803 --> 01:13:14.784]  It is sobering.
[01:13:14.904 --> 01:13:26.651]  It is delightful, but at the same time scary, in that I realize that we are growing very fast, and I don't know what the New World Order is going to do to counter us.
[01:13:26.671 --> 01:13:27.812]  They've tried things in the past.
[01:13:27.852 --> 01:13:35.576]  They've done a lot of really sinister and nasty things of late that I'm not going to give them attention in talking about, but they are scared.
[01:13:37.237 --> 01:13:41.740]  And that's why they're calling for my arrest and others' arrests and torture in camps, publicly.
[01:13:43.587 --> 01:13:51.114]  That's why the Simpcom boys are on my message board and on the dig comment boards and on the MySpace saying they want to kill me.
[01:13:52.455 --> 01:13:59.741]  Because they've sold out to evil, and once you sell out to evil, you start rationalizing what you've done, and then the good guys look evil to you.
[01:14:02.183 --> 01:14:07.127]  And so, we can say this.
[01:14:07.207 --> 01:14:10.150]  We have given them one hell of a run for their money.
[01:14:11.897 --> 01:14:24.262]  We have really countered them in our... I mean, just a year ago, the same group of universities every year put out the same studies, similar studies, a bunch of studies.
[01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:28.544]  And just a year ago, the last study I saw, and it's always a year behind, was the study from 2005, was in 2006.
[01:14:28.584 --> 01:14:30.185]  They report on the study from 2006 and 2007.
[01:14:30.225 --> 01:14:31.065]  They just came out two weeks ago.
[01:14:31.085 --> 01:14:32.125]  The AP reported on a big national study.
[01:14:38.627 --> 01:14:48.134]  That 71% of Americans, might have been 73, no, 71, look it up for yourself, trust but verify.
[01:14:48.154 --> 01:14:56.740]  71% of Americans now say they get more of their news from the Internet and they trust alternative news more than they trust mainstream news.
[01:14:57.441 --> 01:15:00.203]  And newspaper circulation dropped from 61% to 65% in the last year.
[01:15:02.516 --> 01:15:03.817]  We're good to go.
[01:15:03.837 --> 01:15:04.457]  We're good to go.
[01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:32.787]  I like the fact that they were arrogant.
[01:15:49.941 --> 01:15:53.924]  And stumbling around saying let them eat cake as the Bastille is being overrun.
[01:15:54.404 --> 01:16:01.329]  It's not good now that they have woken up and are moving and trying to shut down the web and censor it and shift it on to different systems.
[01:16:01.349 --> 01:16:02.950]  And we're going to do some shows in the next few weeks.
[01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:06.333]  Just like we're doing a show on GMO, we're doing a series on those.
[01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:09.335]  We're doing a series on the attack on the web, Internet 2.
[01:16:09.835 --> 01:16:10.776]  This is very real.
[01:16:10.856 --> 01:16:13.418]  It's now happening, the first stages of it.
[01:16:14.696 --> 01:16:16.057]  And that's another facet to this.
[01:16:16.617 --> 01:16:22.742]  We need to use the Internet while it's still somewhat free and open, like you're not going to have it tomorrow or next week.
[01:16:23.542 --> 01:16:25.984]  They could shut off a nuke tomorrow or two years from now.
[01:16:27.245 --> 01:16:42.275]  I went out by Southwest for some meetings this weekend with some filmmakers, and afterwards we went to a bar-slash-restaurant,
[01:16:43.797 --> 01:16:45.878]  And we'd been at that place a few times years ago.
[01:16:45.898 --> 01:16:46.798]  I hadn't been there in years.
[01:16:46.858 --> 01:16:51.380]  And this same guy lives in the building who we know and had talked to and even given us his card.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:51.980]  We'd Googled it.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:52.741]  He was the real deal.
[01:16:53.341 --> 01:16:54.741]  He's like 55 years old.
[01:16:54.781 --> 01:17:01.144]  He walks over and starts saying, Oh, Alex, you like to look stuff up?
[01:17:01.164 --> 01:17:01.964]  Look this up.
[01:17:02.024 --> 01:17:03.325]  Former Special Forces guy.
[01:17:03.765 --> 01:17:05.986]  Former liaison after that.
[01:17:06.026 --> 01:17:08.367]  Been between the East and West Block in Berlin.
[01:17:08.387 --> 01:17:09.107]  You know, spook.
[01:17:09.867 --> 01:17:11.968]  Runs a pretty good-sized telecommunications company.
[01:17:13.052 --> 01:17:27.537]  And he just said, Alex, when the newt goes off in the U.S., and it's going to happen, or it's going to go off in Paris, probably Paris, but it could happen here, he goes, our tolerance for the stuff that people are saying and doing ends.
[01:17:27.697 --> 01:17:28.457]  And he just looked at me.
[01:17:29.518 --> 01:17:31.258]  And you could tell him somebody's a BS-er.
[01:17:31.638 --> 01:17:35.199]  All these years I ran into this guy probably ten times, because that's the place I'd have meetings.
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.920]  That's where these Hollywood guys like to go.
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:42.582]  You know, upscale bar restaurant, like a lounge.
[01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:48.009]  He never would really say anything or talk to me, but I could tell we're freaking him out.
[01:17:48.029 --> 01:17:53.654]  So he had to walk over and just point blank tell me, when the nuke goes off, the tolerance for the stuff you and others are doing ends.
[01:17:54.694 --> 01:17:55.095]  It's over.
[01:17:56.115 --> 01:17:56.476]  It's over.
[01:17:56.496 --> 01:17:57.416]  It's martial law, Alex.
[01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:02.100]  And, you know, this guy runs companies in Russia, you name it now.
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:02.720]  That's how it works.
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:06.083]  You're a spook when you're younger, then you become a functionary in the government.
[01:18:09.205 --> 01:18:10.386]  But, you know, he looked beaten.
[01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:16.376]  And I was coming back at him and stuff, and he said, yeah, well, that's just the way it is, Alex.
[01:18:17.997 --> 01:18:19.178]  I've talked to so many of those guys.
[01:18:20.438 --> 01:18:22.379]  He doesn't even care if he gives me his card and I know who he is.
[01:18:22.399 --> 01:18:22.980]  He doesn't even care.
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.241]  It's just like, you know, hey, that's how it is.
[01:18:26.281 --> 01:18:31.364]  He just said, Alex, I'm just an infantry soldier, an old infantry soldier, and I just follow orders.
[01:18:32.945 --> 01:18:34.646]  Yeah, you're following orders straight to hell.
[01:18:36.027 --> 01:18:37.207]  Taking this country straight to hell.
[01:18:37.227 --> 01:18:41.910]  All right, we'll come back, hit some news, and take your calls.
[01:18:42.685 --> 01:18:45.747]  But everybody out there, we're in the fight of our lives for our lives.
[01:18:46.367 --> 01:18:47.668]  Screw your heads on straight.
[01:18:48.248 --> 01:18:48.728]  Gut up.
[01:18:49.169 --> 01:18:49.949]  Count the cost.
[01:18:50.389 --> 01:18:51.110]  Info war.
[01:18:51.130 --> 01:18:51.110]  110%.
[01:18:52.851 --> 01:18:53.491]  We're going to beat them.
[01:18:53.511 --> 01:18:54.111]  We don't have a choice.
[01:18:54.351 --> 01:18:55.732]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:55.752 --> 01:18:57.873]  A new world order.
[01:18:58.574 --> 01:19:02.596]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[01:19:02.716 --> 01:19:05.217]  It's known as the Builder Earth.
[01:19:06.298 --> 01:19:08.539]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.481]  For thousands of years, their dark border grew.
[01:19:12.256 --> 01:19:19.585]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:27.601]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:28.061 --> 01:19:31.522]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:31.922 --> 01:19:34.403]  Bill Vargas is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:19:34.483 --> 01:19:35.623]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.663 --> 01:19:36.383]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.403 --> 01:19:37.484]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.704 --> 01:19:38.444]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.684 --> 01:19:39.504]  That's what they have to do.

[01:19:51.367 --> 01:19:52.589]  You have been warned.
[01:19:53.531 --> 01:19:55.353]  Government is best which governs least.
[01:19:55.453 --> 01:19:56.895]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:19:56.995 --> 01:19:59.920]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.924]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:20:03.104 --> 01:20:05.768]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.
[01:20:06.249 --> 01:20:06.489]  Let's go.

[01:21:08.598 --> 01:21:08.938]  We're good to go.
[01:21:39.518 --> 01:21:43.700]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.

[01:21:52.043 --> 01:21:52.784]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:54.036 --> 01:21:59.022]  It's progressing, and it's only a short time until it's completely taken over every aspect of your life.
[01:21:59.502 --> 01:22:00.924]  We are entering martial law.
[01:22:01.425 --> 01:22:03.567]  There are ten telling signs of martial law.
[01:22:04.108 --> 01:22:05.349]  America has them all.
[01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:09.854]  Use the short time left to protect you and your family with the vital information in this book.
[01:22:10.315 --> 01:22:14.299]  Find this infobomb online in book form at survivemartiallaw.com.
[01:22:15.442 --> 01:22:15.962]  We're good to go.
[01:22:15.982 --> 01:22:16.363]  We're good to go.
[01:22:34.528 --> 01:22:36.668]  Surviving can be difficult, but possible.
[01:22:37.269 --> 01:22:41.489]  Arm yourself with the knowledge, as this is the only weapon you will have to protect your family.
[01:22:41.949 --> 01:22:48.511]  Go to S-U-R-V-I-V-E-M-A-R-T-I-A-L-L-A-W.com or call 608-819-8011.
[01:22:48.571 --> 01:22:50.011]  Act today, as there will be no warning.
[01:23:28.186 --> 01:23:32.288]  The globalists have shown they're very bold by carrying out 9-11.
[01:23:34.689 --> 01:23:39.891]  And they're really leaning towards some type of nuke coming off, killing 50,000 people, radiating another couple million.
[01:23:43.333 --> 01:23:49.236]  I would guess, actually, it'd be somewhere like Detroit or something that's a rust belt now, or their assets aren't bashed.
[01:23:50.836 --> 01:23:52.057]  Or someplace in Indiana.
[01:23:54.698 --> 01:23:56.259]  But they might do something spectacular.
[01:23:58.464 --> 01:24:03.046]  They might even blow Manhattan off the map or blow a big hole in it.
[01:24:06.588 --> 01:24:06.968]  Paris.
[01:24:09.549 --> 01:24:10.389]  They like to brag.
[01:24:14.031 --> 01:24:26.036]  And the way these guys work, they can deliver a nuke to one of these Muslim CIA-created organizations, and the guys that drive the truck in over land into Paris or bring it in on a boat into the U.S.
[01:24:26.056 --> 01:24:28.097]  will actually think they're fighting a holy jihad
[01:24:33.328 --> 01:24:36.489]  But something like 9-11 didn't have Arab hands anywhere involved in it.
[01:24:36.529 --> 01:24:40.110]  That was a very sophisticated Hollywood style for the full effect.
[01:24:45.131 --> 01:24:46.732]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:49.112 --> 01:24:49.933]  But here's the headline.
[01:24:49.993 --> 01:24:51.233]  Pharmacologicals.
[01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:53.381]  Lurking in U.S.
[01:24:53.441 --> 01:25:00.725]  drinking water, AP probe found traces of meds and water supplies of 41 million Americans, and that's just where they tested.
[01:25:01.265 --> 01:25:02.666]  Everywhere they tested, they found them.
[01:25:02.986 --> 01:25:09.328]  And time and time again, it's Prozac, it's speed-type drugs, it's hormones, it's just everything.
[01:25:11.369 --> 01:25:17.472]  But the bigger issue, as I said earlier, is that they spin it and say, well, it's only in traces.
[01:25:19.293 --> 01:25:21.614]  Traces high enough where any supplies, the fish...
[01:25:22.944 --> 01:25:26.645]  Have both sexual organs because in their embryonic development it screws them up.
[01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:30.205]  The frogs are both sexes or hermaphrodites.
[01:25:32.346 --> 01:25:37.827]  It's enough to screw them up in all the big studies they've done.
[01:25:37.847 --> 01:25:44.428]  They've done hundreds of thousands of studies of the aquatic amphibian and fish life as well.
[01:25:46.228 --> 01:25:49.729]  But we need to look at the studies that we have
[01:25:50.586 --> 01:26:00.549]  Where they look at total contaminant, parts per million, and you're talking 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, and that's in water that they say is safe to swim in and is good.
[01:26:00.569 --> 01:26:04.470]  A lot of rivers and lakes they shut down and say don't swim in them.
[01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:12.772]  And in this AP study, most of these water sheds are water people are drinking.
[01:26:12.852 --> 01:26:18.153]  They just take it and add chlorine and other...
[01:26:18.962 --> 01:26:20.784]  You know, we never talk about chlorine.
[01:26:20.804 --> 01:26:21.044]  I, um,
[01:26:49.462 --> 01:26:53.165]  I've got a neighborhood pool, and during the summer I'll go there and swim laps.
[01:26:53.925 --> 01:26:56.967]  So I get to know all the guys that you see there twice a week cleaning the pool.
[01:26:58.448 --> 01:27:00.109]  So I tend to go over there and swim about 9 a.m.
[01:27:01.791 --> 01:27:06.854]  And that's when the guys that are cleaning, I don't know why I got into that part of the story.
[01:27:06.894 --> 01:27:09.456]  The point is, they'd say, hey, Alex Jones, hey, Alex Jones.
[01:27:09.476 --> 01:27:10.517]  They're all basically fans.
[01:27:12.598 --> 01:27:16.381]  I'd ask them, I'd say, when you test this water, they'd say, oh, listen, tap water...
[01:27:17.071 --> 01:27:19.953]  Generally has higher chlorine in it than what we even put in the pool.
[01:27:20.593 --> 01:27:23.274]  And they pointed out that you put a fish in tap water.
[01:27:23.655 --> 01:27:24.235]  Take a bucket.
[01:27:24.475 --> 01:27:25.235]  Do a test.
[01:27:25.576 --> 01:27:26.236]  Go to the store.
[01:27:26.896 --> 01:27:28.077]  Get a healthy guppy.
[01:27:28.997 --> 01:27:30.478]  It'll cost you 10 cents, 20 cents.
[01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:33.200]  And go put it in a fish tank, and it'll live a couple years.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.623]  Take that same little guppy, or goldfish, or whatever you like, and put it in a bucket.
[01:27:38.863 --> 01:27:41.144]  But go ahead and give it oxygen, too.
[01:27:41.204 --> 01:27:43.165]  Put an oxygenator in there.
[01:27:44.309 --> 01:27:48.531]  And drop that fish in there with that tap water, and that fish is going to be dead in two days.
[01:27:49.572 --> 01:27:51.492]  In fact, I don't like to do medical experiments.
[01:27:51.512 --> 01:27:52.573]  People will call it mean.
[01:27:53.033 --> 01:27:53.854]  But see, we're humans.
[01:27:54.894 --> 01:28:00.057]  I think I'm going to set up a time-lapse camera in this office, and I think I'm going to go buy a fish.
[01:28:01.237 --> 01:28:03.198]  And I'm going to say, oh, well, it's good enough for us to drink.
[01:28:03.258 --> 01:28:04.038]  I'm not hurting the fish.
[01:28:04.299 --> 01:28:04.939]  He'll be fine.
[01:28:05.159 --> 01:28:11.502]  And I'm going to stick an aerator in there, and I'm going to feed him, and that fish is going to be belly up in two days.
[01:28:11.522 --> 01:28:13.623]  Just, frankly, get it as a test.
[01:28:16.573 --> 01:28:17.413]  That was about two years ago.
[01:28:17.433 --> 01:28:18.874]  I didn't just want to believe the pool guys.
[01:28:19.994 --> 01:28:20.574]  I did a test.
[01:28:20.914 --> 01:28:22.335]  We already have fish tanks at my house.
[01:28:22.415 --> 01:28:28.016]  So when I was buying some more fish for my kids, I just took an extra one and stuck it in a bucket outside under some shade.
[01:28:28.816 --> 01:28:29.897]  Stuck an aerator in there.
[01:28:30.817 --> 01:28:31.357]  And guess what?
[01:28:33.278 --> 01:28:39.759]  He went belly up right next to another bucket with an aerator that had the drops added to it to knock out the chlorine.
[01:28:40.119 --> 01:28:42.280]  You're drinking something that kills frogs and fish.
[01:28:44.088 --> 01:28:45.188]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.468 --> 01:28:47.109]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.009 --> 01:28:50.889]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:54.230]  Fact.
[01:28:54.410 --> 01:29:00.311]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[01:29:00.431 --> 01:29:04.692]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:12.274]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[01:29:12.494 --> 01:29:12.594]  The
[01:29:13.254 --> 01:29:21.418]  Detoxification works with Electro-C Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.
[01:29:21.438 --> 01:29:24.359]  For mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system, clear skin,
[01:29:39.626 --> 01:29:44.448]  Hi neighbor, no matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[01:29:44.508 --> 01:29:49.869]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[01:30:07.919 --> 01:30:11.181]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[01:30:11.821 --> 01:30:15.103]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[01:30:15.723 --> 01:30:19.105]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[01:30:19.705 --> 01:30:24.208]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[01:30:24.928 --> 01:30:26.909]  We will still have two regrets.
[01:30:27.569 --> 01:30:30.911]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[01:30:31.591 --> 01:30:34.433]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[01:30:35.225 --> 01:30:42.091]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[01:30:42.851 --> 01:30:44.252]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:44.312]  800-409-5633.
[01:30:53.917 --> 01:30:55.539]  Attention GCN listeners.
[01:30:55.639 --> 01:30:59.823]  Would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[01:30:59.924 --> 01:31:11.376]  Well, now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[01:31:11.796 --> 01:31:12.257]  We're good to go.
[01:31:30.313 --> 01:31:30.773]  We're good to go.
[01:32:02.134 --> 01:32:06.476]  Insects become climbable spies with tiny cameras, radio controls, and microphones.
[01:32:06.516 --> 01:32:08.436]  Britain makes camera that sees through your clothes.
[01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:12.178]  I want to get through some of that, but first we're going to take your calls.
[01:32:12.318 --> 01:32:15.799]  We've got some news on the economy, war news, police state news.
[01:32:15.859 --> 01:32:20.701]  It's all coming up as we reach the halfway point in this transmission today.
[01:32:23.662 --> 01:32:31.165]  Before I go any further, we've been sponsoring several children throughout my life.
[01:32:32.563 --> 01:32:33.704]  Through Children International.
[01:32:33.764 --> 01:32:39.227]  Back when I was about 6 or 7, my parents sponsored two different children for many years through Children International.
[01:32:40.248 --> 01:32:44.810]  My uncle lived in Guatemala for many years where Children International was working in their city.
[01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:48.413]  In fact, he had folks living down the street from him that worked for Children International.
[01:32:49.613 --> 01:32:50.734]  He's in town right now.
[01:32:50.754 --> 01:32:52.115]  I was just talking to him about it last night.
[01:32:52.155 --> 01:32:54.136]  They literally live in little bitty huts.
[01:32:54.756 --> 01:33:00.480]  They're real individuals that are dedicated, missionary types that are really helping the children.
[01:33:02.293 --> 01:33:08.615]  My uncle even volunteered and helped translate some of the letters from the kids to send them to their parents with a neighbor down the street.
[01:33:09.035 --> 01:33:09.795]  I didn't even know that much.
[01:33:09.835 --> 01:33:11.876]  I just knew he said it was a really good charity and for real.
[01:33:12.836 --> 01:33:16.638]  So when you're going to sponsor a charity, you need to make sure that it's a good charity.
[01:33:17.878 --> 01:33:19.038]  And there are a few other good ones, too.
[01:33:19.098 --> 01:33:21.039]  Meals on Wheels is pretty good.
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.660]  So is Salvation Army.
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:26.861]  But the third world really needs help.
[01:33:27.001 --> 01:33:28.501]  And you can say, well, we've got to worry about ourselves.
[01:33:28.521 --> 01:33:30.582]  Well, folks, especially if you don't have children...
[01:33:31.664 --> 01:33:32.464]  It's a good feeling.
[01:33:32.504 --> 01:33:33.445]  It's a good thing to do.
[01:33:33.505 --> 01:33:34.665]  It's good in the universe.
[01:33:34.705 --> 01:33:35.506]  We put you so.
[01:33:36.266 --> 01:33:37.547]  It's not you do it greedily for yourself.
[01:33:37.567 --> 01:33:40.248]  It's just the right thing to do to sponsor these children.
[01:33:40.268 --> 01:33:42.309]  We're sponsoring two children, an African girl.
[01:33:42.329 --> 01:33:43.669]  We'll tell you about her on another show.
[01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:54.374]  But we're also sponsoring a little boy, Kent, in the Philippines, and he's writing us a letter right now.
[01:33:54.394 --> 01:33:56.055]  I sponsored him about a week and a half ago.
[01:33:57.476 --> 01:33:58.356]  The family earns $175 per month.
[01:33:58.376 --> 01:33:58.696]  He's 10 years old.
[01:34:02.472 --> 01:34:08.215]  And Kent comes from a Christian family, and I sponsored Kent.
[01:34:08.915 --> 01:34:14.498]  If you go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, you can link through on the banners.
[01:34:15.179 --> 01:34:19.941]  There's also one at the top of RonPaulWarroom.com, Prisoners.us.
[01:34:20.101 --> 01:34:27.185]  You can link through and then see the particular child that they want you to sponsor, or you can go through another list of children to sponsor.
[01:34:28.126 --> 01:34:30.827]  But I really do suggest that you sponsor a child.
[01:34:31.593 --> 01:34:33.014]  It's $22 a month.
[01:34:34.255 --> 01:34:36.016]  And I suggest you pick some other charities.
[01:34:36.977 --> 01:34:45.643]  I mean, if you've got extra income, this is a paltry sum to make sure they get three square meals a day, get education, get clothes, get shoes.
[01:34:46.704 --> 01:34:48.785]  I mean, the degradation they live in is unspeakable.
[01:34:48.805 --> 01:34:54.149]  The running sewage, the diseases, the UN people swarming around trying to inject them with bioweapons.
[01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:57.371]  Infowars.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:57.651 --> 01:34:58.612]  Children International.
[01:34:59.870 --> 01:35:02.430]  I helped Kent in the Philippines and another little girl in Africa.
[01:35:03.251 --> 01:35:06.971]  It's time for you to pick a child or two.
[01:35:08.171 --> 01:35:09.132]  Sponsor 20 children.
[01:35:09.152 --> 01:35:10.832]  There's a lot of wealthy people listening right now.
[01:35:12.152 --> 01:35:27.035]  Or, you know, you sit around at Christmas drinking whiskey and eggnog and sitting around the fire having fun and maybe going to Aspen to the slopes or going out shopping and buying your wife jewelry and fur coats.
[01:35:27.075 --> 01:35:27.855]  I know a lot of you do that.
[01:35:28.455 --> 01:35:29.015]  Most of you don't.
[01:35:30.362 --> 01:35:31.482]  You've got that empty feeling.
[01:35:35.083 --> 01:35:48.787]  But to go on Christmas, or the day before Christmas, to go to a Salvation Army and just volunteer, just putting soup into people's bowls, that's where the real help's coming from.
[01:35:48.827 --> 01:35:51.528]  The government and CPS and their system is meant to hurt people.
[01:35:51.848 --> 01:35:54.869]  They've got good people working within their system, but it's compartmentalized where their help
[01:35:55.675 --> 01:35:56.715]  Only gives them a good face.
[01:35:56.755 --> 01:35:57.816]  The overall agenda's bad.
[01:35:58.216 --> 01:35:59.556]  You have to be involved in charity.
[01:35:59.596 --> 01:36:00.576]  I'm not going to start preaching anymore.
[01:36:00.596 --> 01:36:01.096]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:36:01.557 --> 01:36:04.097]  Sponsor at childinfowars.com.
[01:36:06.938 --> 01:36:11.819]  You know, I give thousands of dollars a year to Meals on Wheels, and I'm not a wealthy person.
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:15.540]  But I've gone and delivered meals many years ago.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:16.801]  My wife was involved in it.
[01:36:16.821 --> 01:36:22.082]  I didn't even know that until I got involved years ago, and she used to be involved in it when she was going to UT here in Austin.
[01:36:24.269 --> 01:36:31.013]  And it's just great to go knock on the door and an 85-year-old woman or 80-year-old man answers.
[01:36:31.934 --> 01:36:32.874]  They got cancer.
[01:36:33.415 --> 01:36:35.456]  Their kids don't visit them even though they live in town.
[01:36:36.056 --> 01:36:37.637]  And you sit there and watch TV with them.
[01:36:39.798 --> 01:36:40.939]  They'll start crying, folks.
[01:36:41.219 --> 01:36:41.920]  They'll start crying.
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:43.180]  And your soul.
[01:36:44.581 --> 01:36:47.363]  It isn't that you're doing some goody-two-shoe thing just to feel good about yourself.
[01:36:47.443 --> 01:36:49.664]  It's that you're meant to minister to people.
[01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:53.947]  And by the way, if you don't minister to people, what comes around goes around.
[01:36:56.291 --> 01:37:02.374]  You know, these yuppies that talk about euthanizing people and don't visit their parents or their grandparents, who are they going to have caring for them?
[01:37:02.394 --> 01:37:10.777]  You know, I kind of imagine having enough money someday when I retire to have like a big three-story house and stick my parents on the bottom floor.
[01:37:14.259 --> 01:37:15.339]  I'd be on the second floor.
[01:37:15.419 --> 01:37:18.121]  Maybe my kids wanted to stay while they were in college on the top floor.
[01:37:18.141 --> 01:37:19.181]  I just love family.
[01:37:21.564 --> 01:37:24.406]  You know, my grandmother, she's a great-grandmother to my children.
[01:37:24.446 --> 01:37:26.108]  She's the last remaining grandparent I have.
[01:37:26.148 --> 01:37:27.309]  She's 83 years old.
[01:37:28.170 --> 01:37:30.672]  She's still sharp as a tack and such a beautiful person.
[01:37:31.552 --> 01:37:38.618]  I've tried to get a little bit bigger house because time flies by to the point where she needs to move in with us.
[01:37:41.641 --> 01:37:43.262]  I'm not going to stick her in a nursing home.
[01:37:44.263 --> 01:37:45.144]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[01:37:45.164 --> 01:37:49.988]  Some of them are good, but if they are in a nursing home, you need to visit them every day, every week at least.
[01:37:51.678 --> 01:38:02.643]  That's the problem with our economy being destroyed is that how do you even pay for your own apartment, much less how to pay for a good place for your folks or have a place to keep your folks?
[01:38:03.103 --> 01:38:09.505]  Or how do you work during the day when you and your wife both have to go out and you've got to send your kids to the government school and you can't spend time with them?
[01:38:09.805 --> 01:38:11.286]  See, this is how they destroy our families.
[01:38:11.306 --> 01:38:15.028]  And they wrote documents 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 10 years ago.
[01:38:15.048 --> 01:38:18.409]  There's thousands of documents, textbooks, how they were going to do this to us.
[01:38:22.176 --> 01:38:33.524]  And I watch videos that we posted yesterday of how they forcibly, in Thailand and Africa and everywhere else, go in and force the pregnant women to take tetanus shots.
[01:38:33.564 --> 01:38:35.285]  They give them three tetanus shots.
[01:38:35.645 --> 01:38:36.766]  One shot for seven years.
[01:38:37.907 --> 01:38:40.168]  And the women are like, we don't know why they make us take three.
[01:38:40.749 --> 01:38:42.330]  And then the baby always dies.
[01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:44.271]  They force me to take it.
[01:38:44.631 --> 01:38:47.213]  I was eight months pregnant and the big baby came out.
[01:38:48.234 --> 01:38:49.675]  The baby was dancing in me.
[01:38:50.595 --> 01:38:52.096]  The baby was dancing happy.
[01:38:52.116 --> 01:39:02.044]  This will be my third baby, but after they gave me the third shot, he started trembling the next day, and then the baby died.
[01:39:02.524 --> 01:39:03.965]  You go watch that video, folks.
[01:39:03.985 --> 01:39:04.766]  There's hundreds of them.
[01:39:05.787 --> 01:39:08.268]  And they go to the aid station where they go, well, it's part of a U.N.
[01:39:08.288 --> 01:39:10.190]  program, and there's nothing we can do.
[01:39:10.230 --> 01:39:11.171]  The government makes us.
[01:39:11.191 --> 01:39:13.572]  And they go, well, why are you giving them three tetanus shots?
[01:39:13.973 --> 01:39:14.893]  We just follow orders.
[01:39:14.933 --> 01:39:15.494]  Get out of here.
[01:39:18.484 --> 01:39:23.407]  And it's all like these lanky, weird UN cult people are all, it's for the Earth.
[01:39:24.287 --> 01:39:26.008]  Ah, it's for Gaia.
[01:39:26.789 --> 01:39:30.390]  Meanwhile, the UN's doing nothing about genetic engineering, all the real things that are happening.
[01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:32.472]  All right, I said I'd take your calls, and I'm starting to preach.
[01:39:32.512 --> 01:39:35.573]  The point is, hell is going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:36.594 --> 01:39:39.515]  I'm not saying we shouldn't go in and industrialize those people, educate them.
[01:39:40.076 --> 01:39:42.297]  Once that happened, they'd go to less than two children apiece.
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:43.440]  No.
[01:39:44.001 --> 01:39:54.948]  The Royal Commission on Population said that it would actually boost population, but make sure they were degradated, and then the UN would just have to try to kill and maim the mass of law, because they want to keep them third world.
[01:39:56.069 --> 01:40:00.332]  If they emerged into first or second world, they'd stop having population explosion.
[01:40:00.372 --> 01:40:08.398]  But instead, they cold-bloodedly kill industry, which then causes them to still have, on average, four and a half children, and then they just come in and soft-kill them.
[01:40:12.498 --> 01:40:15.560]  I mean, why not go educate somebody instead of just killing their baby?
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:21.683]  And see, once you start down that road of, well, we kill the babies, it's sad, but somebody has to do it.
[01:40:21.723 --> 01:40:24.564]  We're just willing to do it for the earth and quality of living.
[01:40:24.924 --> 01:40:27.746]  Well, then why not kill 3,000 on 9-11?
[01:40:28.206 --> 01:40:30.267]  I mean, it's just so the West knows best.
[01:40:30.287 --> 01:40:32.708]  We've got to be in place and run the world.
[01:40:33.288 --> 01:40:34.329]  And then what do they do in Iraq?
[01:40:34.369 --> 01:40:35.709]  They go in with family planning.
[01:40:35.749 --> 01:40:38.151]  They go in with inoculations, sterilizations.
[01:40:38.191 --> 01:40:38.811]  They've caught them.
[01:40:39.463 --> 01:40:45.348]  They make them under their directive, take GMO food and plant only GMO crops in Iraq.
[01:40:45.809 --> 01:40:50.553]  Now they've got to buy from the U.S., which isn't even the U.S., big global companies that are in this nation.
[01:40:51.814 --> 01:40:55.077]  Their base here is where the only ones dumb enough to support it is their home market.
[01:40:55.818 --> 01:40:56.899]  Everybody else runs from it.
[01:40:56.919 --> 01:41:01.083]  I mean, Africans eat GMO foods and they get totally sick.
[01:41:01.644 --> 01:41:02.884]  Because they weren't raised on it.
[01:41:03.285 --> 01:41:10.827]  Suddenly a shipment comes in, they eat it, and everybody breaks out in hives and starts having nosebleeds, and now the people literally, the governments leave it rotting on them.
[01:41:10.887 --> 01:41:12.087]  Oh, those ignorant Africans.
[01:41:12.828 --> 01:41:13.188]  Oh, really?
[01:41:13.228 --> 01:41:14.268]  Is a pig ignorant?
[01:41:14.708 --> 01:41:17.749]  A pig won't eat GMO soybeans or GMO corn.
[01:41:18.509 --> 01:41:21.650]  A pig has a better olfactory nose than a bloodhound.
[01:41:21.991 --> 01:41:22.651]  It won't eat it.
[01:41:24.631 --> 01:41:25.972]  You have to starve a pig.
[01:41:25.992 --> 01:41:29.553]  There are studies until it will eat GMO.
[01:41:30.754 --> 01:41:31.595]  Cross species.
[01:41:36.118 --> 01:41:38.620]  You know, that pig knows that's poison.
[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:41.982]  The rats that eat this stuff, their livers shrivel up, they die.
[01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:46.305]  All the monkeys they give aspartame to die.
[01:41:46.505 --> 01:41:46.926]  All of them.
[01:41:47.846 --> 01:41:51.509]  And that's the study that Searle used to get aspartame approved.
[01:41:54.451 --> 01:41:56.252]  Frank in D.C., first time caller, go ahead.
[01:41:57.093 --> 01:41:58.334]  Hi Alex, I'm a big fan.
[01:41:58.434 --> 01:41:59.535]  You're very well researched, Alex.
[01:42:00.879 --> 01:42:01.600]  Well, that's all I do.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:02.621]  Okay.
[01:42:02.681 --> 01:42:03.982]  Have you seen Bush's eyes lately?
[01:42:04.002 --> 01:42:06.004]  Do you think he's crazy on drugs or drinking again?
[01:42:07.165 --> 01:42:08.806]  Bush has always been a drug addict.
[01:42:09.207 --> 01:42:11.949]  And once you get on drugs, you tend to go back and forth on them.
[01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:17.794]  And he's probably like Hitler on drugs prescribed by his physician, which are even worse in most cases.
[01:42:17.854 --> 01:42:27.363]  But, I mean, do you really believe five years ago he fell down and got bruises on his forehead, chin, both sides of his face, a black eye, and what looked like scratches on his neck?
[01:42:28.098 --> 01:42:31.199]  I mean, there's knockdown, drag-out fights, drunkenness.
[01:42:31.619 --> 01:42:33.180]  He said he swallowed a pretzel.
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:34.360]  Yeah, right.
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:38.921]  Have you ever heard about the rumor there's none of our gold in Fort Knox?
[01:42:39.462 --> 01:42:40.122]  There's no rumor.
[01:42:40.162 --> 01:42:44.223]  They won't allow an assessment of it, and there's been admissions that they've been selling it out.
[01:42:44.543 --> 01:42:52.886]  The IMF, just in the last two years, trying to suppress gold prices, this was in Reuters yesterday, I didn't even get to it on air, has sold half its gold reserves.
[01:42:53.385 --> 01:42:54.025]  We're good to go.
[01:43:07.765 --> 01:43:08.566]  Where did our gold go?
[01:43:08.586 --> 01:43:11.088]  Did either Rothschild fake it, or did they ship it to England?
[01:43:11.128 --> 01:43:12.289]  Well, it's secret.
[01:43:12.409 --> 01:43:17.714]  We know it's gone, but, and there hasn't been a, since 55, there hasn't been an accounting for it.
[01:43:17.974 --> 01:43:19.896]  But we know how they did it in 33.
[01:43:20.437 --> 01:43:25.401]  And so we know then that's basically, and we have the similar thing with what's happened currently.
[01:43:26.102 --> 01:43:27.663]  And would you like me to tell you how they did it in 33?
[01:43:27.743 --> 01:43:28.884]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:43:29.505 --> 01:43:29.805]  Okay.
[01:43:30.406 --> 01:43:32.928]  They had us in three years of sustained oppression.
[01:43:33.914 --> 01:43:37.517]  The depth of the Depression was when Roosevelt went into office in 1933.
[01:43:38.097 --> 01:43:39.779]  He declared the War Powers Act.
[01:43:40.099 --> 01:43:40.560]  Go read it.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:44.122]  And basically declared federal martial economic law.
[01:43:45.023 --> 01:44:00.536]  He then said, everyone must turn in, by law, your silver certificates and your greenbacks, your dollars, and we are going, I mean, everyone must turn in your gold to get greenbacks, and then they would give you greenbacks back for those.
[01:44:01.713 --> 01:44:02.513]  Got it opposite there.
[01:44:02.533 --> 01:44:04.434]  So they made you turn your gold in.
[01:44:04.974 --> 01:44:07.695]  You were only allowed a certain amount for a wedding ring or a necklace.
[01:44:08.335 --> 01:44:11.816]  My grandmother remembers being a small child and hearing him talk about this.
[01:44:12.457 --> 01:44:13.937]  Most of these people are dying.
[01:44:13.957 --> 01:44:14.797]  I need to go out and interview them.
[01:44:14.817 --> 01:44:16.078]  And it was in the newspapers, too.
[01:44:16.158 --> 01:44:18.298]  But the point is we need to get people on tape so you can see.
[01:44:18.839 --> 01:44:22.980]  People who are 85, 90 remember it because, you know, it happened in 33 when they were little kids.
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:25.941]  And my grandmother remembers it.
[01:44:26.781 --> 01:44:29.202]  And they just, everybody turned their gold in.
[01:44:29.824 --> 01:44:30.204]  We're good.
[01:45:00.339 --> 01:45:03.341]  And so that's a similar thing to what they do.
[01:45:06.163 --> 01:45:08.024]  So why do you think Pelosi and Reader are so spotless?
[01:45:08.064 --> 01:45:08.984]  Are they getting paid off?
[01:45:09.004 --> 01:45:10.185]  Are they just being blackmailed?
[01:45:10.445 --> 01:45:11.466]  They don't have to be paid off.
[01:45:12.186 --> 01:45:14.447]  She's a Speaker of the House because she was an insider.
[01:45:16.048 --> 01:45:21.151]  You don't see Ron Paul, you know, who's senior, who should be like a Speaker at this point, with seniority up there.
[01:45:22.152 --> 01:45:22.832]  They keep them out.
[01:45:23.613 --> 01:45:25.574]  I mean, the Democrats are totally bought and paid for.
[01:45:26.488 --> 01:45:28.129]  Yeah, they don't stand up to nothing.
[01:45:29.529 --> 01:45:30.990]  I've never seen something like it.
[01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:37.132]  Well, I mean, Pelosi's daughter got paid close to a million dollars to make a film about Bush by the White House.
[01:45:38.573 --> 01:45:39.053]  It's crazy.
[01:45:39.073 --> 01:45:43.175]  Every time you open the paper up, it's like he does some new crazy thing, and they don't say anything.
[01:45:43.715 --> 01:45:46.376]  No, the establishment is making their final move.
[01:45:46.436 --> 01:45:47.256]  I appreciate your call.
[01:45:47.617 --> 01:45:48.857]  Jim in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:45:50.498 --> 01:45:50.918]  Thanks, Josh.
[01:45:51.505 --> 01:46:08.875]  Hey Alex, I was recently reading the Clinton death list on Infowars and I was wondering if anybody knows whatever became of the woman who suspiciously turned up missing after going public about her participation in the orgy with George W. Bush and Victor Ashe, who Bush appointed ambassador to Poland.
[01:46:09.415 --> 01:46:11.777]  Is she still in the land of the living or does anybody know?
[01:46:12.077 --> 01:46:22.223]  We know the black woman in Houston that filed a suit saying he'd raped her within two weeks was gunned down repeatedly in the back of the head in Houston and they ruled it a suicide.
[01:46:22.915 --> 01:46:24.196]  Yeah, I was aware of that.
[01:46:24.256 --> 01:46:26.778]  This woman, you probably remember this story.
[01:46:26.818 --> 01:46:28.379]  It's fairly recent, the last few months.
[01:46:28.419 --> 01:46:36.845]  But she made a statement after she came out with the story about witnessing what went on between George W. Bush and Victor Ashe.
[01:46:36.885 --> 01:46:41.449]  And she said, I'm not afraid of any man of flesh and blood, no matter how powerful his position.
[01:46:41.849 --> 01:46:45.772]  And right after that, her friend said, she's missing.
[01:46:45.812 --> 01:46:46.732]  We don't know where she is.
[01:46:46.772 --> 01:46:47.673]  This is not like her.
[01:46:48.053 --> 01:46:51.436]  And I just wondered if she was dead or what, if anybody knows.
[01:46:52.474 --> 01:46:54.215]  We need to look into that.
[01:46:55.296 --> 01:47:03.199]  I wanted you to be sure to remind your listeners every day to be careful about their safety, not leave their drinks unattended.
[01:47:03.219 --> 01:47:06.441]  You may think I'm too paranoid, but you know what I'm saying.
[01:47:06.461 --> 01:47:07.981]  No, Jim, I appreciate your call.
[01:47:08.061 --> 01:47:09.582]  I really don't know what you're saying.
[01:47:11.103 --> 01:47:16.065]  Somebody like me has to be careful of that, but for the general public to get into a mindset of fear...
[01:47:17.307 --> 01:47:20.550]  There's all these guys that wear masks when they do their YouTube videos because they're afraid.
[01:47:21.090 --> 01:47:22.331]  That's not going to save us.
[01:47:22.391 --> 01:47:25.374]  We need to be out in the open, have free speech, speak out.
[01:47:27.075 --> 01:47:29.357]  Now, yeah, if you mess with the Bush daughters, you're going to get killed.
[01:47:29.377 --> 01:47:30.618]  You're going to get anthrax mailed to you.
[01:47:30.638 --> 01:47:34.242]  I remember one time, 40th birthday, one of my buddy's friends were at a steakhouse.
[01:47:34.662 --> 01:47:35.963]  The Bush daughters are there drunk.
[01:47:36.383 --> 01:47:38.065]  He wanted to go out to the car and get his video camera.
[01:47:38.125 --> 01:47:39.066]  I said, do not do that.
[01:47:39.626 --> 01:47:41.848]  I'll fight the New World Order, but it's kind of like mafia rules.
[01:47:41.948 --> 01:47:42.849]  I don't mess with their kids.
[01:47:44.364 --> 01:47:51.906]  And, you know, I don't do things that I know are like literally walking up and kicking an alligator, a huge crocodile in the head.
[01:47:52.806 --> 01:47:54.787]  You know, I'm exposing them.
[01:47:54.807 --> 01:47:55.387]  I'm fighting them.
[01:47:55.787 --> 01:47:57.548]  I'm fighting them, but I'm not saying bring it on.
[01:47:57.568 --> 01:47:58.068]  You understand?
[01:48:00.208 --> 01:48:03.689]  You know, I'm doing what I have to do.
[01:48:03.929 --> 01:48:09.111]  But no, you know, creeping around, being afraid, thinking everybody's watching us.
[01:48:10.282 --> 01:48:11.883]  They watch everybody, but it's a grid.
[01:48:11.923 --> 01:48:15.626]  It's AI computers, and so they know what percentage of the country disagrees with them.
[01:48:15.646 --> 01:48:17.967]  They know it's very hard for them individually to crack the data.
[01:48:18.167 --> 01:48:19.989]  Now, they want to go into that data and go look you up.
[01:48:20.009 --> 01:48:20.429]  They can.
[01:48:20.809 --> 01:48:23.551]  But they don't have people hovering over each one of your files.
[01:48:26.933 --> 01:48:27.274]  Okay?
[01:48:28.414 --> 01:48:29.575]  But they want you to be afraid.
[01:48:29.595 --> 01:48:30.956]  They're announcing they're spying on you.
[01:48:30.976 --> 01:48:34.619]  They're announcing all this tyranny to scare you so you'll shut up.
[01:48:34.639 --> 01:48:39.362]  That's why they're on TV saying, if you disagree with the government, we're going to put you in a FEMA camp.
[01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:42.391]  If you disagree with the war, you need to be put in jail.
[01:48:42.431 --> 01:48:46.512]  You shouldn't be allowed to stand outside of the 9-11 inside job or a no blood for oil sign.
[01:48:46.552 --> 01:48:47.412]  You need to be tased.
[01:48:48.732 --> 01:48:52.713]  They want cops to hear that and think it's normal, so the cop tases you and then he gets in trouble.
[01:48:53.133 --> 01:48:53.553]  Not them.
[01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:56.734]  They're saying torture's good because they want to sell it.
[01:48:56.914 --> 01:49:00.475]  They have to sell us on this, and the good news is people are not buying it.
[01:49:01.315 --> 01:49:01.916]  The majority.
[01:49:02.876 --> 01:49:07.397]  And as long as the vast majority know they're the terrorists and know that they're bad, they're not going to be able to carry this out.
[01:49:09.443 --> 01:49:14.206]  So getting into like a James Bond movie, creeping around, looking under your bed, thinking they're after you.
[01:49:14.806 --> 01:49:15.367]  I mean, look at me.
[01:49:15.467 --> 01:49:18.629]  I'm the big kahuna.
[01:49:18.689 --> 01:49:22.911]  Loved by the people, reviled by the leaders of the patriot movement because everybody hates the king.
[01:49:24.112 --> 01:49:24.952]  I didn't ask for this.
[01:49:25.873 --> 01:49:27.694]  You know, hating me while running their ads on my show.
[01:49:29.235 --> 01:49:29.875]  Parasiting.
[01:49:31.016 --> 01:49:32.437]  They're all going to cheer if I get killed.
[01:49:33.228 --> 01:49:34.449]  They're all going to love it.
[01:49:34.489 --> 01:49:35.110]  But you aren't.
[01:49:35.610 --> 01:49:38.493]  You know, the truth and the info goes on.
[01:49:38.553 --> 01:49:39.834]  But look at who I am.
[01:49:39.854 --> 01:49:42.717]  You know, think about me.
[01:49:42.897 --> 01:49:43.678]  I just committed.
[01:49:44.879 --> 01:49:45.679]  I say it all the time.
[01:49:45.699 --> 01:49:47.901]  When you drive down the highway, it's the number one cause of death.
[01:49:47.941 --> 01:49:49.663]  You still get on the highway because you want to drive somewhere.
[01:49:50.404 --> 01:49:51.505]  We'll fight the New World Order.
[01:49:52.185 --> 01:49:52.966]  Stop worrying about it.
[01:49:54.210 --> 01:49:56.771]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:49:57.091 --> 01:49:58.372]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[01:49:58.652 --> 01:50:00.632]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:50:00.793 --> 01:50:02.553]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:50:02.693 --> 01:50:03.934]  The Late Great USA.
[01:50:04.174 --> 01:50:05.594]  America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:50:05.954 --> 01:50:12.797]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:51:12.307 --> 01:51:15.868]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[01:51:16.188 --> 01:51:22.169]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:25.949]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:51:26.189 --> 01:51:30.730]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.790]  Do your part.
[01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:34.331]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.

[01:51:53.471 --> 01:51:55.292]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:51:55.452 --> 01:52:02.135]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:52:02.415 --> 01:52:10.578]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:52:10.799 --> 01:52:16.521]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:52:16.701 --> 01:52:18.482]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:52:18.542 --> 01:52:20.744]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:52:20.844 --> 01:52:25.088]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:52:25.248 --> 01:52:27.450]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[01:52:27.490 --> 01:52:35.256]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:59.853]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.514 --> 01:53:02.695]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:08.462 --> 01:53:10.403]  All right, I'm going to try to move quickly through your calls.
[01:53:10.443 --> 01:53:11.563]  We've got a guest coming up.
[01:53:11.623 --> 01:53:15.845]  It's part two on the GMO poisoning of our food supply and our environment.
[01:53:17.165 --> 01:53:18.726]  Keith in Ohio, first-time caller.
[01:53:18.766 --> 01:53:19.626]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:53:20.146 --> 01:53:21.247]  Yes, Alex, this is Keith.
[01:53:21.887 --> 01:53:22.187]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:22.667 --> 01:53:26.228]  Yeah, my cousin is a cop in New York.
[01:53:26.248 --> 01:53:27.089]  He's in his 50s.
[01:53:27.549 --> 01:53:31.390]  And he told me he don't hang out with the newer crowd because they're trained different.
[01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:36.012]  And I was wondering, he didn't go into it in any depth, but
[01:53:37.894 --> 01:53:39.015]  Do you know anything about this?
[01:53:39.456 --> 01:53:51.847]  Yeah, the police union three years ago bought a full-page ad, I think it was the New York Post, or was it the New York Daily News, it doesn't matter, and said, look, we've been ordered to arrest you if you're sitting on a sidewalk and you're pregnant.
[01:53:52.368 --> 01:53:55.631]  We've been ordered to arrest you if you're drinking a Coke on the subway.
[01:53:55.671 --> 01:53:57.012]  We've been ordered to be mean to you.
[01:53:57.392 --> 01:53:58.934]  We don't like this image we're getting.
[01:53:59.454 --> 01:54:03.298]  We don't like what Mayor Giuliani and now Bloomberg are doing.
[01:54:03.923 --> 01:54:07.444]  And yeah, the young ones have been taught to talk to you like you're scum, like they're a drill sergeant.
[01:54:08.224 --> 01:54:11.565]  And they've been trained to just taser you at the drop of a hat if you argue with them.
[01:54:12.145 --> 01:54:13.126]  Like, why am I getting a ticket?
[01:54:13.146 --> 01:54:13.906]  That's it, taste.
[01:54:14.806 --> 01:54:17.307]  And that's because the establishment now calls us civilians.
[01:54:17.367 --> 01:54:18.527]  Cops are civilians, too.
[01:54:19.328 --> 01:54:22.889]  The military is a separate thing outside of our country.
[01:54:22.909 --> 01:54:23.969]  It doesn't have jurisdiction.
[01:54:24.009 --> 01:54:27.570]  Now they're saying it does, and mayors call us civilians, everybody else does.
[01:54:28.388 --> 01:54:33.712]  And it's like we're a bunch of preschoolers and they're the teachers and they're going to beat us upside the head with a paddle if we're bad.
[01:54:34.173 --> 01:54:35.133]  So that's the new culture.
[01:54:35.854 --> 01:54:38.656]  Yeah, and I've been listening to your show every day.
[01:54:38.696 --> 01:54:43.840]  It's very interesting, you know, when you get into it and then you're coming home just to listen to it, you know.
[01:54:45.161 --> 01:54:47.043]  They get up to date on stuff, you know.
[01:54:47.063 --> 01:54:49.805]  A lot of people laugh at you at work and stuff like that.
[01:54:50.245 --> 01:54:53.628]  But then I had a guy actually get mad about it and then...
[01:54:54.255 --> 01:54:58.558]  I pass out the movies, he ends up getting one, and then he comes up to me and wants more information.
[01:54:59.539 --> 01:55:00.520]  Well, that's what I've found.
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:06.564]  The most effective thing is to not even say, hey, I agree with this movie, but say, hey, here's an endgame, here's a terror storm.
[01:55:07.245 --> 01:55:08.386]  What do you think of this?
[01:55:08.666 --> 01:55:10.007]  Will you tell me what you think?
[01:55:10.027 --> 01:55:10.948]  Because I have questions.
[01:55:11.688 --> 01:55:11.868]  Yeah.
[01:55:12.369 --> 01:55:17.793]  Because sometimes if you tell them, hey, buddy, you're dumb, you don't know anything, they might think you're trying to put them down.
[01:55:18.373 --> 01:55:19.194]  It's more effective...
[01:55:21.123 --> 01:55:24.185]  In some cases, to just give them the information.
[01:55:24.785 --> 01:55:24.985]  Yeah.
[01:55:25.086 --> 01:55:25.626]  Well, thank you.
[01:55:26.266 --> 01:55:26.686]  Thank you.
[01:55:26.746 --> 01:55:27.647]  Good to hear from you, Keith.
[01:55:28.107 --> 01:55:29.748]  Justin in Colorado, you're on the air.
[01:55:29.768 --> 01:55:32.270]  Hey, boss.
[01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:33.270]  How are you doing today?
[01:55:34.691 --> 01:55:36.792]  I'm calling from Colorado.
[01:55:37.993 --> 01:55:38.173]  And...
[01:55:38.846 --> 01:55:44.511]  I have a couple things to say really fast because I'm at work up in the top of a mountain, so if my connection is bad, that's what's going on.
[01:55:44.751 --> 01:55:45.092]  Okay, bro.
[01:55:45.112 --> 01:55:46.953]  I grew up in Dripping Springs, Texas.
[01:55:47.013 --> 01:55:49.215]  I'm a paid Prison Planet subscriber.
[01:55:49.316 --> 01:55:50.316]  I love the podcast.
[01:55:50.397 --> 01:55:54.100]  I was actually listening to the Friday show this morning, so that was my first question.
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:56:01.306]  He was talking about the decline of the dollar, and I was wondering, I was told recently that the OPEC is going to drop the dollar as the standard of trading.
[01:56:01.366 --> 01:56:03.168]  You can answer these after I jump off the line.
[01:56:03.188 --> 01:56:03.929]  Okay.
[01:56:05.117 --> 01:56:10.420]  What do you think about the forecast of his two years versus a potential drop of the dollar this month?
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:12.961]  And the long-term effects of that.
[01:56:13.041 --> 01:56:16.363]  My next question is about Blackwater's PR firm representing Hillary.
[01:56:16.984 --> 01:56:18.885]  And are they still involved?
[01:56:18.925 --> 01:56:21.666]  Because if so, they're doing a really amazing comeback job.
[01:56:22.346 --> 01:56:28.170]  And my last thing I want to say is, I know days when you get down, boss, a lot of people, we're behind you.
[01:56:28.190 --> 01:56:29.610]  So don't let it get to you, man.
[01:56:29.630 --> 01:56:30.511]  You have a good day, Alex.
[01:56:31.218 --> 01:56:31.658]  Thank you.
[01:56:32.179 --> 01:56:33.900]  The first question was about the dollar.
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:35.380]  I appreciate that call.
[01:56:37.362 --> 01:56:38.602]  From Justin in Colorado.
[01:56:40.363 --> 01:56:42.364]  Let me try to answer that as best I can.
[01:56:44.305 --> 01:56:45.986]  Try to answer that as best I can.
[01:56:47.047 --> 01:56:48.188]  We're on the edge of the cliff.
[01:56:48.268 --> 01:56:49.528]  It could blow up any time.
[01:56:49.568 --> 01:56:55.912]  It's like we're sitting on top of giant kegs of dynamite with torches in our hands, with black powder at our feet.
[01:56:57.145 --> 01:56:59.906]  Anytime a spark could fall, we won't even know what hit us.
[01:56:59.966 --> 01:57:01.226]  It'll just explode, and that's it.
[01:57:02.226 --> 01:57:06.987]  But, so we know it's going to blow sometime, and they think the torch is going to burn down in two years.
[01:57:07.867 --> 01:57:09.767]  Within two years, you know, something's going to happen.
[01:57:09.987 --> 01:57:13.288]  But there's a fuse that's already lit that we know is going to go off within two years.
[01:57:13.888 --> 01:57:22.449]  So it's kind of like, is the torch going to make it go off any minute, or is that fuse that's a mile away but burning fast towards us, is it going to go off?
[01:57:23.210 --> 01:57:24.350]  Either way, it's going to go off.
[01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:25.790]  Either way, there's no way to get out of it.
[01:57:26.502 --> 01:57:27.522]  According to all the experts.
[01:57:28.643 --> 01:57:31.864]  But yeah, with Greenspan telling the Arabs to dump the dollar, oh boy.
[01:57:34.826 --> 01:57:39.828]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:39.948 --> 01:57:50.032]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.252 --> 01:57:50.933]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.573 --> 01:57:52.633]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.334 --> 01:57:54.474]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.095 --> 01:57:55.875]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.653 --> 01:57:57.534]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.554 --> 01:58:01.876]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.396 --> 01:58:06.519]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:17.806]  We had Jeffrey Smith, the best-selling author on GMO Foods, almost a few weeks ago, part two of that interview coming up after the break.
[01:58:19.346 --> 01:58:22.088]  We'll continue with your phone calls as well and a smattering of other news.
[01:58:22.108 --> 01:58:24.550]  We've got a caller from London who disagrees with me.
[01:58:24.570 --> 01:58:25.130]  We'll go to him.
[01:58:26.112 --> 01:58:32.197]  Tom from London, going to the head of the line, because we go to those who disagree at the head of the line.
[01:58:33.838 --> 01:58:39.402]  But before we do that, ladies and gentlemen, I want to tell you about a couple great sponsors.
[01:58:39.923 --> 01:58:42.865]  One of them is Aloe, Ease, Colon, and Body Cleanse.
[01:58:43.045 --> 01:58:50.751]  And I don't get up here and pitch health supplements that are magic machines that cost $5,000 and make you live forever.
[01:58:50.851 --> 01:58:51.712]  I'm not into baloney.
[01:58:52.518 --> 01:58:54.540]  Or magical creams that are $500 a bottle.
[01:58:55.100 --> 01:59:04.327]  This is just super high quality aloe vera concentrate tablets that have a bunch of other herbs that are known for detoxifying that have been medically studied to clean out your body.
[01:59:05.028 --> 01:59:06.149]  And boy, will it do it.
[01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:10.993]  And aloe vera is just one of the super foods that are out there right along with hemp.
[01:59:11.813 --> 01:59:12.914]  People love hemp, hemp, hemp.
[01:59:12.934 --> 01:59:18.799]  But this, in my book from the studies I've seen, aloe vera might even, not industrially, but for health-wise, might even be a lot better than hemp.
[01:59:19.923 --> 01:59:20.103]  1-800-569-4056.
[01:59:20.123 --> 01:59:20.604]  1-800-569-4056.
[01:59:20.624 --> 01:59:29.969]  Aloe's Colon and Body Cleanse.
[01:59:29.989 --> 01:59:30.730]  1-800-569-4056.
[01:59:31.730 --> 01:59:34.092]  I suggest you give them a call.
[01:59:35.393 --> 01:59:39.255]  Speaking of food, we told you wheat prices would go up.
[01:59:39.295 --> 01:59:44.098]  They doubled and they tripled, and right now they're at double prices, gyrating up and down.
[01:59:44.678 --> 01:59:45.699]  Everything else is up.
[01:59:46.571 --> 01:59:48.252]  There's all this economic uncertainty.
[01:59:48.592 --> 01:59:51.194]  It's a no-brainer to have a year's supply of food.
[01:59:52.615 --> 01:59:54.175]  I'm looking at two years' supply of food.
[01:59:54.195 --> 01:59:56.257]  I already have a three-year supply for one person.
[01:59:56.277 --> 02:00:00.359]  I've just got two years more from Steve Shank and the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[02:00:00.759 --> 02:00:06.542]  eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, huge banners, the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:06.582 --> 02:00:07.343]  Go in there, check it out.
[02:00:07.363 --> 02:00:10.865]  High-quality, clean, healthy, non-GMO food.
[02:00:11.905 --> 02:00:22.150]  Freeze-dried, lasts for more than 10 years in climate-controlled, 10 years in non-climate-controlled, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:24.071]  Okay, let's go to Tom in London.
[02:00:24.131 --> 02:00:24.911]  Tom, you're on the air.
[02:00:24.971 --> 02:00:25.352]  Go ahead.
[02:00:26.692 --> 02:00:27.613]  Hi, hi.
[02:00:28.653 --> 02:00:28.953]  Go ahead.
[02:00:31.054 --> 02:00:37.297]  Yeah, I've heard you say a couple of times that Blair is going for the presidency of Europe.
[02:00:39.964 --> 02:00:47.285]  And that somehow they're reorganizing the rules to sort of put the country rotation at the head of the line.
[02:00:49.406 --> 02:00:53.366]  That's what the British paper said, am I wrong?
[02:00:56.067 --> 02:01:00.608]  You are wrong about that, yeah, because, I mean, it's confusing two things.
[02:01:01.288 --> 02:01:07.689]  The EU presidency is held by a country, not by an individual, and...
[02:01:09.815 --> 02:01:13.536]  What happens is, yeah, it goes in rotation.
[02:01:14.956 --> 02:01:18.337]  Well, let me stop you because I oversimplify things.
[02:01:18.637 --> 02:01:23.199]  You know, there's been talk, remember a year ago, of him getting one of the two different positions.
[02:01:24.119 --> 02:01:31.901]  And so now he's in the running for the one where the group itself votes him in?
[02:01:31.921 --> 02:01:32.701]  Or explain this to me.
[02:01:34.142 --> 02:01:35.502]  Okay, what it is,
[02:01:36.181 --> 02:01:45.168]  The positions you're talking about are new positions created by the EU Constitution that's been repackaged as the Treaty of Lisbon.
[02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:51.793]  They changed nothing, but they repackaged it and were able to sort of force it on people.
[02:01:51.813 --> 02:01:53.495]  And then they forced it without a vote last week.
[02:01:56.477 --> 02:01:58.138]  Exactly, yeah, that's the one.
[02:01:58.218 --> 02:02:07.501]  But it's being called, I mean, I understand there's two different presidencies, so I think, I just haven't been clear, but they are saying he's up to be the next president of Europe.
[02:02:07.721 --> 02:02:11.123]  You're saying I'm wrong because this is a different procedure in this body.
[02:02:11.303 --> 02:02:12.303]  And I guess you're right.
[02:02:12.803 --> 02:02:17.665]  What they're not doing, they're not rotating, they're not changing any sort of rotation.
[02:02:17.905 --> 02:02:24.248]  He's going for a new position of president of Europe, and that's going to be held by an individual, possibly him.
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:31.563]  I understand, sir.
[02:02:32.104 --> 02:02:33.825]  I was just not using the proper terms.
[02:02:34.185 --> 02:02:35.226]  And thank you for correcting me.
[02:02:35.626 --> 02:02:36.487]  Do you want to add any more?
[02:02:36.507 --> 02:02:40.830]  Okay, stay there.
[02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:42.772]  I'm going to let you briefly finish and we've got our guests coming up.
[02:02:46.241 --> 02:02:54.183]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[02:02:54.644 --> 02:02:57.805]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[02:02:58.185 --> 02:03:01.246]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:30.480]  We're good to go.
[02:03:46.127 --> 02:03:58.852]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:03:59.272 --> 02:04:05.995]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[02:04:06.375 --> 02:04:09.977]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:04:10.337 --> 02:04:13.519]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:04:13.739 --> 02:04:15.460]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:21.244]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[02:04:21.644 --> 02:04:28.828]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com while you're visiting the online video store.
[02:04:29.128 --> 02:04:36.856]  Be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[02:04:37.276 --> 02:04:39.538]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[02:04:39.899 --> 02:04:45.224]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:04:46.036 --> 02:04:46.697]  It's a fact.
[02:04:46.897 --> 02:04:54.383]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:04:54.503 --> 02:05:03.370]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:05:03.650 --> 02:05:14.178]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:05:14.438 --> 02:05:15.358]  That's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org.
[02:05:15.378 --> 02:05:16.759]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[02:05:42.310 --> 02:05:45.312]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[02:05:47.253 --> 02:05:53.276]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.877 --> 02:05:56.918]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.759 --> 02:05:59.220]  Okay.
[02:06:00.981 --> 02:06:10.366]  Next Monday, Jeffrey Smith, best-selling author on Seas of Deception and now Genetic Roulette,
[02:06:11.476 --> 02:06:21.363]  He's going to be with us for two full hours for a full breakdown of the GMO foods, what they're in, how you avoid them, how we get them out of the foods, their master plan, how we stop them.
[02:06:21.663 --> 02:06:26.166]  He's just going to be with us right now until about 40 after or so today, and then we'll take your calls.
[02:06:26.507 --> 02:06:33.311]  The fellow that disagrees with me, he's going to come back on in all the calls for the last 20 minutes of the show or so today.
[02:06:33.752 --> 02:06:34.792]  So we're going to get to that caller.
[02:06:34.832 --> 02:06:35.733]  That's all coming up.
[02:06:36.293 --> 02:06:41.237]  But this is such an important issue that I am carrying his DVD two-CD set.
[02:06:42.074 --> 02:06:44.316]  It's $19.95 at Infowars.com.
[02:06:45.196 --> 02:06:49.539]  A DVD film and two lengthy audio CDs breaking it all down.
[02:06:50.159 --> 02:06:54.002]  You may know all about this, but your neighbors, your friends, your family, they don't know.
[02:06:54.222 --> 02:06:59.305]  You need to get this very nicely packaged book set.
[02:06:59.325 --> 02:07:03.628]  $19.95, and we also carry both of his books, also very inexpensive, at Infowars.com.
[02:07:03.748 --> 02:07:05.669]  I hope you get them and get them out to people.
[02:07:05.709 --> 02:07:05.969]  In fact...
[02:07:07.853 --> 02:07:22.607]  Jeffrey, before we go into a synopsis today, I want you today, and we appreciate you joining us, to just again give a big overview of what they're currently doing, what their plan is, and the health effects that we know of.
[02:07:23.328 --> 02:07:27.172]  And when you come back next week, we'll go through the whole history and just, you know,
[02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:32.912]  For two hours, we're going to do a lot more detail, and in the last hour of that two-hour interview, take calls.
[02:07:33.572 --> 02:07:42.855]  But first off, for folks that want to go to Infowars.com and get Seeds of Deception and, of course, the new book, Genetic Roulette.
[02:07:43.596 --> 02:07:43.776]  Very good.
[02:07:43.896 --> 02:07:47.058]  And I'll give the information about GMOs and the context of that.
[02:07:47.098 --> 02:07:50.380]  Seeds of Deception, I wrote that in 2003, and what it shows in a story format...
[02:08:10.777 --> 02:08:18.162]  Is how industry manipulation and political collusion, not sound science, forced these dangerous products onto the market.
[02:08:18.502 --> 02:08:20.964]  The FDA was basically hijacked.
[02:08:20.984 --> 02:08:26.728]  They put the person in charge of policy that was Monsanto's former attorney and later Monsanto's vice president.
[02:08:27.228 --> 02:08:31.051]  And he was in charge of the policy which stated that the agency, the FDA...
[02:08:31.638 --> 02:08:38.220]  Was not aware of any information showing that GM foods were substantially different, and therefore no testing was necessary.
[02:08:38.561 --> 02:08:43.542]  Documents later made public from a lawsuit showed that that statement was a complete lie.
[02:08:43.902 --> 02:08:53.706]  In fact, the overwhelming consensus among the FDA's own scientists were that GMOs were inherently unsafe and could create allergies, toxins, new diseases, and nutritional problems.
[02:08:54.276 --> 02:09:16.283]  Also in Seeds of Deception, I describe how efforts by the biotechnology industry had forced a five-part news series on bovine growth hormone by Monsanto off the air, how a UC Berkeley professor was threatened by a senior Mexican government official threatening, we know where your children go to school, to try and get them not to publish incriminating evidence.
[02:09:16.763 --> 02:09:22.425]  I talk about how the FDA hid information from Congress and withheld information from the consumers,
[02:09:22.731 --> 02:09:22.971]  Thank you.
[02:09:22.991 --> 02:09:23.192]  Thank you.
[02:09:45.217 --> 02:09:48.819]  And I realized that it's a tall order to ask a politician to read a book.
[02:09:48.859 --> 02:09:50.860]  Those that did made a big impact.
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:56.062]  In fact, it was responsible for a lot of GM-free zones that started around the world.
[02:09:56.523 --> 02:09:59.924]  But most of the politicians just put it down.
[02:10:00.004 --> 02:10:07.548]  So I decided I needed a book to convey the outrageous health risks easily to busy decision-makers.
[02:10:07.968 --> 02:10:11.470]  But it had to be in-depth enough to convince scientists
[02:10:11.886 --> 02:10:13.047]  And staff researchers.
[02:10:13.407 --> 02:10:14.328]  Yeah, I want to stop you.
[02:10:14.608 --> 02:10:20.413]  I mean, they're really quick reads, but it's all scientific, with a bibliography, with the data at the bottom.
[02:10:20.774 --> 02:10:25.338]  And so you literally get like a master's degree in this by reading the book.
[02:10:25.498 --> 02:10:29.902]  And like you said, it's like an executive summary, but it's also a thick book.
[02:10:29.962 --> 02:10:30.962]  It just goes in chapters.
[02:10:31.503 --> 02:10:33.745]  Right, and that's the second book that I wrote, Genetic Roulette.
[02:10:33.765 --> 02:10:34.966]  The first one's a storybook.
[02:10:34.986 --> 02:10:38.069]  The second one is Genetic Roulette, where I worked with more than 30 scientists
[02:10:39.164 --> 02:10:41.084]  To document all the known health risks.
[02:10:41.184 --> 02:10:43.625]  And it turns out we came up with 65.
[02:10:44.085 --> 02:10:55.207]  The first 20 are adverse reactions, including thousands of sick, sterile, and dead livestock, thousands of toxic and allergic reactions, damage to virtually every organ and system studied.
[02:10:55.667 --> 02:11:02.949]  The other 45 show that theoretical risks, things that might go wrong because of what we now know about science,
[02:11:03.547 --> 02:11:04.827]  But I figured that wasn't enough.
[02:11:04.907 --> 02:11:16.030]  If I gave that to a politician, if I gave that to a superintendent of schools, if I gave that to a well-meaning, well-thinking person, they might think, oh, I'm sure our FDA is aware of the problem that is protecting us.
[02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:27.092]  So I wrote a second part which showed that all of the government assessments around the world are not competent to even identify most of the health risks described in Part 1.
[02:11:27.572 --> 02:11:28.452]  I went even further.
[02:11:28.512 --> 02:11:31.413]  In Part 3, I meticulously broke out how
[02:11:32.142 --> 02:11:44.710]  Industry-funded studies are designed to avoid finding problems, how they use older animals instead of young, more sensitive ones, how they use obsolete and obscure detection methods, faulty statistics.
[02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:47.051]  Well, they also don't even do that.
[02:11:47.551 --> 02:12:00.079]  Like we talked about last week or two weeks ago, they will even take Monsanto, who bought Searle, Searle's own study where all the monkeys that they give aspartame in their milk
[02:12:00.459 --> 02:12:00.999]  Absolutely.
[02:12:01.019 --> 02:12:01.820]  You're absolutely right.
[02:12:27.236 --> 02:12:33.738]  So, I basically, in the second book, Genetic Roulette, it's the first time that all the known health risks are put together.
[02:12:33.798 --> 02:12:56.106]  So, like the huge infant mortality rate among rats, the increase in allergies in England, and the sterility of pigs and cows, the deaths among livestock, the problems of people breathing, the BT, or the genetically modified pollen, all the things that we know about that have been traced through either peer-reviewed published journals or medical reports, and all the science
[02:12:56.556 --> 02:13:07.398]  It explains how clearly these guys are gambling with our health and are ready to dismiss our environment simply because they want to get this stuff on the market quickly to make a big buck.
[02:13:07.438 --> 02:13:08.438]  Now, let's be clear.
[02:13:08.478 --> 02:13:09.579]  It's not just gambling.
[02:13:10.259 --> 02:13:25.702]  As major publications have reported, what, in 99, the Monsanto executive, I can paraphrase, I know you've got the quote, said, look, our goal is to contaminate everything and then you won't have a choice and then we're going to claim ownership over everything that's contaminated because our genetics will jump out of our corn into your corn and if there's
[02:13:26.202 --> 02:13:27.263]  1% of our genetics.
[02:13:27.303 --> 02:13:28.044]  We own the courts.
[02:13:28.304 --> 02:13:31.566]  They'll rule you robbed us even though we contaminated you.
[02:13:31.886 --> 02:13:41.013]  It's not gambling because they knew 25, 30 years ago that you change one gene, it changes others, creates new amino acids, new things that never existed.
[02:13:41.293 --> 02:13:49.559]  We know it's shrinking the livers, destroying the organs of the rats, the guinea pigs, the gerbils, the rabbits, the animals they feed it to.
[02:13:49.579 --> 02:13:50.979]  And your books go over all that.
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:53.001]  So now it isn't gambling.
[02:13:53.021 --> 02:13:54.402]  They know full well what they're doing.
[02:13:54.827 --> 02:13:55.568]  You're absolutely right.
[02:13:55.588 --> 02:13:59.210]  And that brings us to the third item, which is that thing called the GMO Trilogy.
[02:13:59.230 --> 02:14:01.772]  It's got two DVDs plus an audio CD.
[02:14:02.193 --> 02:14:10.059]  The first DVD talks a lot about what you talked about in terms of the contamination, the problems in nature, the problems with agriculture.
[02:14:10.419 --> 02:14:20.727]  It highlights a friend of mine, Percy Schmeisser, who is a Canadian canola farmer who was contaminated by Monsanto's canola from passing trucks bringing their canola to market.
[02:14:20.887 --> 02:14:23.549]  And by the way, for those that don't know, we had him on like five times.
[02:14:24.176 --> 02:14:25.937]  He had the bills for his seeds.
[02:14:26.017 --> 02:14:27.618]  He wasn't growing theirs.
[02:14:27.898 --> 02:14:31.520]  But they would drop pesticide bombs on his property.
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:33.001]  It would kill a big area.
[02:14:33.021 --> 02:14:34.302]  They saw one living plant.
[02:14:34.562 --> 02:14:36.003]  They knew that it had their genetics.
[02:14:36.043 --> 02:14:37.024]  I mean, that is incredible.
[02:14:37.764 --> 02:14:41.626]  And I'll tell you, he shared some information with me that I'll share now with your readers.
[02:14:41.646 --> 02:14:43.467]  They might find it interesting.
[02:14:43.807 --> 02:14:53.413]  He was at an event with his wife, and there was a guy there who had testified against him in Monsanto's trial, claiming that he had bought GM seeds
[02:14:53.993 --> 02:14:54.713]  We're good to go.
[02:15:19.386 --> 02:15:22.307]  And the guy, it turns out, died a few months later.
[02:15:22.347 --> 02:15:40.794]  He had liver cancer and he appeared to be going clean by telling about how he was allegedly bribed by Monsanto for allegedly, you notice I'm putting this in there to cover myself legally, for allegedly perjuring himself at the court.
[02:15:41.214 --> 02:15:48.057]  And it turns out some other farmers locally were taken on fishing trips by Monsanto, apparently, or brought to
[02:15:48.795 --> 02:15:51.938]  It's incredible, the mafia tactics that they use.
[02:15:51.958 --> 02:15:55.601]  Now, in the time we've got left in the short segment...
[02:16:09.256 --> 02:16:20.622]  Any gauge, I know it's always fluctuating, on how many of the processed foods and even the processed additives that they put in things that we don't think of as highly processed have the main seven GMO crops in them?
[02:16:21.303 --> 02:16:27.286]  Well, I would say that if it's in a box and it's processed, probably 9 out of 10.
[02:16:27.886 --> 02:16:34.690]  I would say out of the entire supermarket, 60 to 70 percent because you have a lot of whole foods from the produce section.
[02:16:35.336 --> 02:16:43.260]  So the reason why I say 9 out of 10, if you look at a list of ingredients, and there's a lot of them, a lot of times it's soy or corn derivatives.
[02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:49.724]  Dextrose, maltodextrin, high-fructose corn syrup, soy lecithin, soy protein, and then there's vegetable oil.
[02:16:50.084 --> 02:16:54.806]  The four major vegetable oils in the United States are the four major GM crops.
[02:16:55.367 --> 02:16:56.927]  Soy, corn, cotton, and canola.
[02:16:57.207 --> 02:17:02.110]  There's also the non-GM crops would be sunflower, safflower, olive, or anything else.
[02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:03.831]  But the major ones
[02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:07.170]  When we get back, Brazilian protesters destroy GM crops.
[02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:09.652]  They've done the same thing in Asia, Africa, and France.
[02:17:09.672 --> 02:17:11.493]  Why do they have their humanity, their guts, left?
[02:17:11.533 --> 02:17:11.953]  Why don't we?
[02:17:31.826 --> 02:17:34.867]  When we come back, we're going to get our guest's take on that.
[02:17:35.587 --> 02:17:36.628]  He's Jeffrey Smith.
[02:17:37.308 --> 02:17:39.789]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:46.431 --> 02:17:47.852]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:48.912 --> 02:17:49.972]  A new world order.
[02:17:50.673 --> 02:17:54.914]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[02:17:55.574 --> 02:17:57.355]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:17:58.395 --> 02:18:00.576]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:18:01.198 --> 02:18:03.620]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:11.766]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:14.708 --> 02:18:19.672]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:20.172 --> 02:18:23.615]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:24.035 --> 02:18:26.097]  Bill Vargas is making great progress toward the world.
[02:18:26.597 --> 02:18:27.738]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:27.758 --> 02:18:28.519]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.539 --> 02:18:29.600]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:30.541]  They're after power.
[02:18:30.761 --> 02:18:31.842]  That's what they have to do.

[02:19:47.321 --> 02:19:50.845]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:19:50.946 --> 02:19:52.808]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:19:52.828 --> 02:19:56.151]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:19:56.472 --> 02:20:01.978]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.

[02:22:22.239 --> 02:22:23.439]  To expose what's happening.
[02:22:24.060 --> 02:22:25.780]  The good news is the war is on.
[02:22:26.020 --> 02:22:29.541]  The Vatican of all places came out and said it's a sin to eat GMO food.
[02:22:30.701 --> 02:22:34.663]  So now I hope that the billion, 100 million Catholics will listen to that.
[02:22:35.383 --> 02:22:37.683]  Brazilian protesters destroy GM crops.
[02:22:38.184 --> 02:22:40.704]  Tell us about that, Jeffrey Smith.
[02:22:41.525 --> 02:22:46.626]  Well, I was in Brazil last year, soon after there was a horrible tragedy where
[02:22:47.165 --> 02:22:54.368]  There were some farmers occupying a research station owned by Syngenta, one of the big five biotech companies.
[02:22:55.028 --> 02:23:00.110]  And they had their goons sort of come up and start shooting and they killed one of the protesters.
[02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:05.952]  And you don't get a lot of deaths necessarily related to the GMO movement, but this was one of a few.
[02:23:05.992 --> 02:23:15.056]  They had a similar situation down in Uruguay where they had they're trying to clear out farmers off of land so that the
[02:23:15.578 --> 02:23:24.021]  Big, rich GM soy producers could have more land to plant, and there was a couple of deaths associated with those as well.
[02:23:24.461 --> 02:23:34.564]  So recently, last week, about 300 women burst into a property owned by Monsanto and destroyed a tree nursery as well as genetically modified corn.
[02:23:35.084 --> 02:23:44.527]  Now, the corn was just recently approved by the Brazilian government, and this is the latest in a really horrendous
[02:23:44.983 --> 02:23:46.504]  Turn of events in Brazil.
[02:23:47.225 --> 02:23:57.852]  President Lula was elected having promised that he would be killing all of the genetically engineered progress in the country, that he would not allow it to be planted.
[02:23:58.513 --> 02:24:05.418]  But when he got into office, someone evidently changed his mind and he went ahead and tried to approve it.
[02:24:06.118 --> 02:24:13.003]  And what was happening before then is apparently the soy seeds were being smuggled in from Argentina
[02:24:13.522 --> 02:24:15.544]  And planted widely in the South.
[02:24:16.044 --> 02:24:18.126]  And this was not like just a random thing.
[02:24:18.146 --> 02:24:25.692]  I mean, there was huge amounts of seed designed specifically for southern Brazil that just happened to be smuggled over from Argentina.
[02:24:25.712 --> 02:24:28.554]  And the seeds weren't necessarily designed for Argentina at all.
[02:24:28.574 --> 02:24:29.935]  It was designed for Brazil.
[02:24:30.336 --> 02:24:34.139]  So they ended up flooding the southern part of the country with soybeans.
[02:24:34.639 --> 02:24:37.461]  And then Lula eventually said, well, it's being planted anyway.
[02:24:37.481 --> 02:24:39.243]  We'll just make it legal.
[02:24:39.867 --> 02:24:52.614]  And now a similar thing has happened with corn, where they've smuggled corn in and they're planting that in places illegally, and they just approved genetically engineered corn in Brazil so that the workers there are absolutely furious.
[02:24:53.135 --> 02:24:59.879]  And so they went into Monsanto's test fields and destroyed some of these genetically modified corn plants.
[02:24:59.899 --> 02:25:00.499]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:25:00.539 --> 02:25:01.600]  They voted to block it.
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:02.400]  They don't want it.
[02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:04.581]  When it was illegal, they brought it in and planted it.
[02:25:05.022 --> 02:25:07.323]  Now they've legalized it, and the people are saying that's it.
[02:25:08.015 --> 02:25:08.495]  Exactly.
[02:25:08.936 --> 02:25:19.483]  Now, I've interviewed plenty of people that were crop pullers in England, and virtually an entire village went out and pulled out genetically modified crops.
[02:25:19.983 --> 02:25:31.311]  And then there was this big lawsuit, and it was quite a dramatic scene because some of these people might have lost their jobs, and it was a pretty harsh economic reality if they were found guilty.
[02:25:31.771 --> 02:25:35.694]  Well, the jury not only found them not guilty...
[02:25:36.297 --> 02:25:41.500]  But the jury waited outside the courtroom afterwards to give all of the crop pullers hugs.
[02:25:42.401 --> 02:25:43.522]  Now let me stop you right there.
[02:25:43.562 --> 02:25:59.692]  That's why the American Bar Association and in England their barrister association has moved to start getting rid of juries and just have corporate kangaroo courts because they know that's the spirit of liberty where a whole village goes out in France or England and pulls something up or burns something down.
[02:26:00.013 --> 02:26:04.996]  That's scaring the system as they militarily try to smuggle it into Europe everywhere else.
[02:26:05.566 --> 02:26:05.966]  That's right.
[02:26:06.006 --> 02:26:18.196]  It happened also in France, and the jury said that it was a proper motive of self-defense for those that pulled the crops in some cases, because they were defending their land against something that was dangerous.
[02:26:18.717 --> 02:26:21.099]  Now, it hasn't always come down that way.
[02:26:21.299 --> 02:26:30.967]  There's some protesters that have had to go to jail, but pulling crops out is one of the ways that protesters have been fighting GMOs around the world.
[02:26:31.482 --> 02:26:39.707]  Now, that is probably a form of terrorism in the United States, and so I'm not advocating that as an action because it could have harsh consequences.
[02:26:40.147 --> 02:26:55.115]  But what I am advocating here is that people learn which products are GMO and avoid them and let their friends and family know, and we can create a wave of opposition simply by our economic choices and through education.
[02:26:55.135 --> 02:27:00.258]  And just like with the milk, though, they're moving to where you can't label and say, I don't have your GMO hormone.
[02:27:00.837 --> 02:27:01.338]  Exactly.
[02:27:01.378 --> 02:27:05.162]  Right now, you see, we had a similar tipping point with the milk.
[02:27:05.423 --> 02:27:16.396]  We had educated so many people about the cancer that was related to the milk from cows treated with RBGH, which is bovine growth hormone, and about the increased levels of twins,
[02:27:19.027 --> 02:27:19.868]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:27:19.908 --> 02:27:21.089]  Final segment with our guest.
[02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:24.371]  He'll be back next week, next Monday with us for two full hours.
[02:27:24.731 --> 02:27:25.592]  He's Jeffrey Smith.
[02:27:25.612 --> 02:27:29.294]  Check out his books and videos at Infowars.com right now.
[02:27:29.554 --> 02:27:30.175]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:30.195 --> 02:27:30.875]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.239 --> 02:27:37.179]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.639 --> 02:27:39.240]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.161 --> 02:27:42.863]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.815 --> 02:27:47.996]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[02:27:48.096 --> 02:27:50.378]  of the New Traumatical Report here on Genesis.
[02:27:50.518 --> 02:27:53.481]  Allicin's natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:27:53.541 --> 02:27:54.242]  is a real thing.
[02:27:54.322 --> 02:28:01.208]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for a fresh, never-before-available garlic.
[02:28:01.328 --> 02:28:06.593]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[02:28:07.273 --> 02:28:12.197]  And it kills fleshing bacteria, MRSA, acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.

[02:28:50.945 --> 02:28:53.886]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:28:54.206 --> 02:28:56.748]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:28:57.128 --> 02:29:01.950]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:29:02.331 --> 02:29:07.693]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:29:07.993 --> 02:29:10.955]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[02:29:11.155 --> 02:29:12.316]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[02:29:34.554 --> 02:29:34.795]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:45.993 --> 02:29:47.214]  Tomorrow may be too late.

[02:30:33.490 --> 02:30:34.871]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:30:34.891 --> 02:30:35.892]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:02.128 --> 02:31:09.799]  Alright, we just got our guests for a few more minutes.
[02:31:09.839 --> 02:31:11.501]  Two full hours next week.
[02:31:13.604 --> 02:31:17.069]  Yeah, they plant GMO crops that then take over your crops.
[02:31:17.984 --> 02:31:18.444]  I think so.
[02:31:44.056 --> 02:31:46.676]  Jeffrey Smith, I think that's a great angle to sue them.
[02:31:46.736 --> 02:31:49.117]  I know that the main court that it all gets appealed to is in St.
[02:31:49.137 --> 02:31:52.317]  Louis, and Monsanto and others just own that, basically, and run it.
[02:31:52.978 --> 02:31:55.038]  That's a kangaroo court from all the evidence we've got.
[02:31:55.658 --> 02:31:59.319]  But, I mean, if they're contaminating you, what about people suing them for contamination?
[02:32:00.139 --> 02:32:13.421]  Well, it turns out Percy Schmeisser, who was sued by Monsanto, is now countersuing, because during the trial, Monsanto kept saying all Percy Schmeisser had to do was to let us know that we had
[02:32:13.854 --> 02:32:19.316]  That he had our patented crops growing on his farm, and we would have come over and removed them.
[02:32:19.796 --> 02:32:23.297]  So, of course, he was contaminated again, and he called Monsanto.
[02:32:23.717 --> 02:32:32.420]  And so Monsanto faxed over a non-disclosure and contract form for him to sign in order for them to come and remove the plants.
[02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:41.763]  And it turns out it would have meant that Percy could never sue Monsanto in the future, and he couldn't talk about anything related to Monsanto again.
[02:32:42.318 --> 02:32:47.099]  He said, I refuse to sign away my rights, but you have to come over and remove your plants.
[02:32:47.560 --> 02:32:52.421]  So Monsanto said, sorry, Percy's been non-cooperative and did not come to remove the plants.
[02:32:53.001 --> 02:32:59.903]  So Percy hired someone for about $600, and they removed the plants, and now he's suing Monsanto for that sum.
[02:33:00.463 --> 02:33:06.345]  And if he wins, then it sets a precedent which could end up setting Monsanto back by millions of dollars.
[02:33:06.980 --> 02:33:09.982]  Well, I recommended to him six years ago that he do that.
[02:33:10.002 --> 02:33:14.125]  I'm not saying he's doing it because I recommended it, but it seemed like a good course there.
[02:33:14.625 --> 02:33:15.366]  Yes, it was.
[02:33:15.426 --> 02:33:20.930]  In fact, and of course, he's going to be contaminated every year because canola seeds are really small.
[02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:21.870]  They fly in the wind.
[02:33:21.890 --> 02:33:23.271]  The pollen flies.
[02:33:23.692 --> 02:33:25.373]  Things come off the passing trucks.
[02:33:25.433 --> 02:33:27.514]  The pollen comes from nearby farms.
[02:33:28.095 --> 02:33:35.400]  As you'll see from the film in the GMO trilogy, there's some farmers from his area
[02:33:35.748 --> 02:33:42.173]  That you can just watch the canola blow over onto their field, and they're collecting samples to prove it for their court case.
[02:33:42.193 --> 02:33:44.134]  Well, seeds are designed to spread life.
[02:33:44.655 --> 02:33:53.041]  I was in Hawaii, and you know, in Hawaii it was pure lava rock, and now it's a lush tropical paradise more than 2,000 miles away from the nearest mainland.
[02:33:53.321 --> 02:33:54.602]  Where did it get those seeds?
[02:33:55.083 --> 02:34:03.549]  Nature is designed to spread her bounty, and it's an absolutely inevitable thing that GMOs will contaminate around the earth,
[02:34:04.059 --> 02:34:06.241]  If allowed to propagate for long enough.
[02:34:06.722 --> 02:34:07.983]  Well, not just GMOs.
[02:34:08.003 --> 02:34:10.946]  Let's look at an invasive species as an example.
[02:34:11.446 --> 02:34:13.148]  Humans bring in lumber from Brazil.
[02:34:13.208 --> 02:34:14.429]  The fire ant comes in.
[02:34:15.010 --> 02:34:21.156]  There's hardly any rabbits, any quail left in Texas in the entire south and into the west.
[02:34:22.236 --> 02:34:25.018]  Fire ants now drop out of trees on you when you're in the woods.
[02:34:25.038 --> 02:34:26.439]  There's less birds.
[02:34:26.459 --> 02:34:34.144]  You can climb up in a tree, almost any tree, and you'll see dead birds' eggs, dead birds, animals, snakes are dying, lizards are dying.
[02:34:34.604 --> 02:34:38.987]  That's just one natural species that unnaturally got brought in.
[02:34:39.467 --> 02:34:40.808]  Imagine all this GMO.
[02:34:41.368 --> 02:34:42.789]  Now consider salmon.
[02:34:43.129 --> 02:34:46.931]  They took some genetically modified salmon, and they said it was completely fine.
[02:34:46.951 --> 02:34:49.493]  They put it into tanks with non-GM salmon.
[02:34:49.895 --> 02:34:50.075]  Uberfish!
[02:34:50.095 --> 02:34:50.355]  Uberfish!
[02:35:14.804 --> 02:35:22.085]  And they've also done studies where these guys don't know how to get back upstream, and so if they replace the natural salmon, they could completely die out in the wild.
[02:35:22.565 --> 02:35:36.548]  They did a computer model where they figured what would happen to 60,000 fish if they introduced just 60 genetically engineered fish with certain characteristics, and to their surprise, they were wiped out within about 40 generations.
[02:35:38.108 --> 02:35:40.329]  And we're talking 40 years with salmon, then?
[02:35:40.849 --> 02:35:40.989]  Yes.
[02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:45.122]  Now, in closing, this is only the tip of the iceberg.
[02:35:45.142 --> 02:35:48.743]  We're going to investigate all these different facets next Monday for two hours.
[02:35:49.143 --> 02:35:50.304]  Very important date, folks.
[02:35:51.044 --> 02:35:51.865]  Mark your calendar.
[02:35:51.905 --> 02:35:57.987]  But in closing, the world is waking up to these guys, but they're just buying more and more governments and seem to not care.
[02:35:58.047 --> 02:36:03.470]  So a collision, a huge clash is now happening.
[02:36:03.530 --> 02:36:07.732]  But as more and more disasters happen, they're not going to be able to cover it up.
[02:36:09.273 --> 02:36:12.154]  Do you picture someday in the future these executives going to prison?
[02:36:12.954 --> 02:36:15.755]  Well, I wouldn't be opposed to it that way.
[02:36:15.775 --> 02:36:33.182]  You see, I don't know if that's going to happen, but what I do sense is that before the end of next year, before the end of 2009, I predict that there will be enough informed consumers who have clear non-GM choices that it will take GMOs out of the food supply.
[02:36:33.802 --> 02:36:35.443]  When we hit the tipping point in Europe,
[02:36:35.834 --> 02:36:39.535]  Within a single week, virtually every major food company committed to remove GM ingredients.
[02:36:39.735 --> 02:36:47.336]  I believe that that tipping point will happen in the United States, and it'll happen because of educated consumers with clear non-GM choices.
[02:36:48.377 --> 02:36:58.839]  And that's why they're passing all these laws, quote, against enviro-terrorists, not because they really care about people raiding fur farms, and I am against that, and I am against violence and burning things down because that can hurt innocents.
[02:36:59.842 --> 02:37:04.946]  But because they might even provocateur things to then try to ban protesting it or something.
[02:37:04.966 --> 02:37:08.588]  And that's the whole agenda that government and corporations are going with now.
[02:37:09.269 --> 02:37:15.573]  Just like in Montebello last year at the SPP, North American Union meeting, finally we caught them and it actually came out they did it.
[02:37:15.894 --> 02:37:20.617]  The police dressed up like anarchists, attacked cops as a pretext to attack the peaceful people.
[02:37:20.937 --> 02:37:22.558]  I think staying peaceful is very important.
[02:37:23.399 --> 02:37:23.959]  Absolutely.
[02:37:24.019 --> 02:37:27.362]  And I've seen some pretty violent protests as I've traveled around the world.
[02:37:27.902 --> 02:37:29.223]  And I think, you see, I don't think
[02:37:29.781 --> 02:37:32.123]  We should rely on convincing governments.
[02:37:32.223 --> 02:37:33.184]  It's an unstable thing.
[02:37:33.204 --> 02:37:38.128]  I was invited by the Polish government to give a press conference with the environment minister.
[02:37:38.528 --> 02:37:39.749]  It was very much against GMOs.
[02:37:39.789 --> 02:37:41.770]  A week later, the government was changed.
[02:37:42.251 --> 02:37:48.536]  I was in Thailand working with getting information to cabinet ministers on a particular vote on GMOs.
[02:37:48.576 --> 02:37:50.497]  A month later, the government was changed.
[02:37:50.777 --> 02:37:58.123]  I think we have to go with a stable base, and that is consumers who are at the top of the food chain, and let them know about what is a healthy choice
[02:37:58.641 --> 02:38:01.744]  I think that's where our success will be.
[02:38:01.985 --> 02:38:09.172]  And folks, if you study advertising and psychology, the Pavlovian habitualization is the key.
[02:38:09.793 --> 02:38:11.114]  We are habitualized.
[02:38:12.051 --> 02:38:12.511]  We're good to go.
[02:38:12.551 --> 02:38:13.332]  We're good to go.
[02:38:33.340 --> 02:38:34.460]  You agree with that statement?
[02:39:03.092 --> 02:39:07.935]  Well, I would say that there's evidence that these things can actually have very fast reaction.
[02:39:08.095 --> 02:39:15.420]  I mean, one guy fed some potatoes to his rats, and they developed potentially precancerous cell growth in their digestive tract within 10 days.
[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:20.223]  Smaller brains, livers, and testicles, partial atrophy of the liver, damaged immune system.
[02:39:21.544 --> 02:39:27.988]  And not only that, but eating a GM crop now might also allow the genes to transfer into your gut bacteria
[02:39:28.581 --> 02:39:34.483]  Where we might stay and continue to produce proteins there that shouldn't be in your digestive system at all for the rest of your life.
[02:39:34.723 --> 02:39:35.963]  Again, there's no may about it.
[02:39:36.003 --> 02:39:55.009]  Just with MMR shots and measles shots, it's been directly in major study after major study linked to Crohn's and other type gut disorders, autoimmune responses, and they're now finding the antibodies for the measles shots in those cultures where the DNA of the gut has changed.
[02:39:55.049 --> 02:39:58.230]  Now, that's separate from GMO, but it is a GMO vaccine.
[02:39:58.826 --> 02:40:10.050]  Right, and the only human feeding study showed that the genes that were inserted into soybeans ended up transferring to the DNA of human gut bacteria and continued to function long after the person stopped eating genetically engineered soy.
[02:40:10.170 --> 02:40:11.431]  That's the same thing with the honeybees.
[02:40:11.551 --> 02:40:13.912]  They, in Germany, has done, what, two studies?
[02:40:13.972 --> 02:40:14.812]  England's done one.
[02:40:14.832 --> 02:40:25.116]  Again, there's limited studies, but in all those studies, they're finding that the Terminator corn pollen for the development of the pesticide has now impregnated the gut of the bee.
[02:40:26.058 --> 02:40:31.019]  Yeah, there was a study from corn in Germany from a Liberty Link corn.
[02:40:31.979 --> 02:40:34.740]  Well, these are just some themes from next week, so to speak.
[02:40:35.260 --> 02:40:36.340]  Absolutely.
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:38.140]  So you're saying you know of one study.
[02:40:38.180 --> 02:40:38.980]  I've seen two others.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:39.581]  Have you seen those?
[02:40:40.721 --> 02:40:43.521]  Not with the transfer into the gut microorganisms.
[02:40:43.581 --> 02:40:44.441]  I'd like to see that, no.
[02:40:44.962 --> 02:40:45.942]  I'll get that from you over the week.
[02:40:46.102 --> 02:40:48.102]  Well, we had a few guests on last year about it.
[02:40:48.122 --> 02:40:49.142]  That's where I remember reading about it.
[02:40:49.422 --> 02:40:51.023]  Well, listen, thank you for joining us, sir.
[02:40:51.063 --> 02:40:52.203]  I really appreciate the time.
[02:40:52.890 --> 02:40:53.550]  My pleasure.
[02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:54.030]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:40:54.270 --> 02:40:54.671]  Take care.
[02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:56.191]  There goes Jeffrey Smith.
[02:40:56.711 --> 02:41:04.074]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're carrying Seeds of Deception, the GMO trilogy, two DVDs and a CD, 1995.
[02:41:05.514 --> 02:41:07.995]  Two films and a CD in one little box.
[02:41:08.555 --> 02:41:09.475]  Very well packaged.
[02:41:09.955 --> 02:41:10.776]  Genetic roulette.
[02:41:11.496 --> 02:41:16.837]  I know you know about this, but you need to buy it like I did a few weeks ago.
[02:41:17.438 --> 02:41:18.438]  You need to read it.
[02:41:19.415 --> 02:41:21.397]  You need to put it on television.
[02:41:21.417 --> 02:41:24.699]  You need to show it to your children so they start reading the labels.
[02:41:24.739 --> 02:41:26.080]  This isn't a joke, okay?
[02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:27.821]  We're not playing games here.
[02:41:30.543 --> 02:41:32.825]  And by the way, a lot of websites are selling these for twice the price.
[02:41:32.845 --> 02:41:36.887]  We're selling them for as inexpensively as possible to get them out to people.
[02:41:38.208 --> 02:41:39.870]  The best deal on here is the GMO Trilogy.
[02:41:41.030 --> 02:41:42.712]  And that's two DVDs and a CD for $19.95.
[02:41:44.013 --> 02:41:44.713]  You cannot beat that.
[02:41:49.594 --> 02:41:50.034]  That deal.
[02:41:50.054 --> 02:41:50.795]  Seeds of Deception, $17.95.
[02:41:52.156 --> 02:41:54.297]  I mean, get together.
[02:41:54.337 --> 02:41:56.899]  Go to the local environmentalist and say, hey, come down to the library.
[02:41:56.919 --> 02:41:58.220]  We're going to have an environmental showing.
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:00.442]  Fifty of them will show up in a medium-sized town.
[02:42:00.942 --> 02:42:04.605]  And they'll go, listen, before we do all this, we need to stop worrying about carbon dioxide.
[02:42:04.625 --> 02:42:10.669]  We need to stop worrying about all these things that the government documents admit they want to tax to control us.
[02:42:11.549 --> 02:42:13.251]  Nobody's saying fossil fuels are great, folks.
[02:42:13.291 --> 02:42:13.631]  We're saying...
[02:42:14.597 --> 02:42:21.060]  The oil companies are behind this scam to get full regulatory control over everything, to control all of these systems.
[02:42:23.061 --> 02:42:27.504]  And you need to then show them these videos and say, this is what we need to be focused on.
[02:42:27.904 --> 02:42:32.446]  You see, they got you diverted off into things that aren't hurting the planet and us.
[02:42:34.067 --> 02:42:35.928]  I mean, how could you not be for a clean environment?
[02:42:36.148 --> 02:42:37.409]  How could you not be for clean water?
[02:42:38.570 --> 02:42:40.431]  But you don't hear the environmental groups, the big ones.
[02:42:40.811 --> 02:42:46.935]  They're talking about not letting farmers plant or taking over land or smart growth or controlling what we do on our own property.
[02:42:47.936 --> 02:42:49.737]  Or what size toilet you have or light bulb.
[02:42:49.957 --> 02:42:50.818]  These are all gimmicks.
[02:42:50.858 --> 02:42:53.199]  Or let's turn the lights off at night for a week.
[02:42:53.239 --> 02:42:56.041]  Or we're going to remote control your thermostats and save energy.
[02:42:56.481 --> 02:42:57.322]  It's all about control.
[02:42:57.982 --> 02:43:02.225]  Instead of just massive crises that are going on everywhere.
[02:43:04.146 --> 02:43:05.887]  Now, did we get Tom from England back on?
[02:43:08.115 --> 02:43:10.416]  Because he disagreed, and then I ran out of time.
[02:43:10.436 --> 02:43:16.019]  I had that guest up, and I wanted to let him come on and tell me where I'm wrong.
[02:43:16.079 --> 02:43:17.020]  And he is right.
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:22.723]  The way I simplify things in Babylon air, we're right about Blair being a sniveling New World Order type.
[02:43:22.763 --> 02:43:25.104]  I told you over a year ago he planned to be EU president.
[02:43:27.725 --> 02:43:30.127]  But there's two different presidencies, and I confuse that.
[02:43:30.567 --> 02:43:32.548]  I just try to shorthand things because there's so much.
[02:43:33.655 --> 02:43:38.857]  I mean, I just shorthanded it a minute ago where I said, Europe's proposing something that'll kill billions.
[02:43:39.998 --> 02:43:43.360]  Well, then you can argue and trifle with that, or you can go to prisonplanet.com.
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:44.520]  Where is it?
[02:43:44.540 --> 02:43:45.321]  I just had it here.
[02:43:47.081 --> 02:43:50.363]  And you can go read the story Paul Watson did on this.
[02:43:53.164 --> 02:43:58.086]  But going back to Tom in England, finish up with what you disagreed with, sir.
[02:43:58.107 --> 02:43:59.927]  Oh, hi.
[02:44:00.147 --> 02:44:00.628]  I just wanted to...
[02:44:01.587 --> 02:44:04.328]  Make a very quick observation about 9-11 truth.
[02:44:06.728 --> 02:44:16.931]  That is that most of the people coming out and going public lately have been sort of centered around, their reasons have been centered around Building 7.
[02:44:19.351 --> 02:44:28.694]  And I think that Building 7 is a pre-positioned sort of fallback position for the cover story.
[02:44:29.434 --> 02:44:29.574]  So
[02:44:30.302 --> 02:44:47.287]  The only thing I'd observe is that focus for people going public, they should be pressed to explain the tower's collapse and should be moving towards there rather than sticking on Building 7.
[02:44:47.667 --> 02:44:58.150]  People like Stephen Jones and others are focusing on the towers, but I just think that they'll be able to neutralise a lot of new...
[02:45:00.169 --> 02:45:07.133]  Well, Tom, Tom, you have to understand, I'm here to bring up all the subjects and get people thinking.
[02:45:08.034 --> 02:45:10.115]  I mean, are you saying you disagree with me even talking about seven?
[02:45:10.135 --> 02:45:17.279]  I think seven's an... No, no, actually, that wasn't what I... I mean, I sort of left aside the other thing that I was going to disagree about, just to make that clear.
[02:45:17.299 --> 02:45:24.504]  No, no, no, I like real disagreement, and I do get things slightly off, but I'm always trying to tell the truth, always trying to go in the right direction.
[02:45:25.044 --> 02:45:25.284]  Absolutely.
[02:45:25.324 --> 02:45:30.687]  Most of the House of Commons are disgraceful dissemblers and liars because they promised... But that's the point I'm making...
[02:45:54.272 --> 02:45:55.173]  Yeah, yeah, I know.
[02:45:55.413 --> 02:46:02.437]  I mean, the other thing I was going to disagree with you about was about some of the things you were talking about, like police hanging around in restaurants listening to you.
[02:46:02.457 --> 02:46:08.401]  But I was going to leave that aside just because I agree with you in the sort of direction.
[02:46:08.621 --> 02:46:10.782]  No, no, no, I'm not going to let you do that.
[02:46:10.862 --> 02:46:11.863]  I'm not going to let you do that.
[02:46:12.243 --> 02:46:15.405]  You were somewhat right about the earlier thing just because I was oversimplifying.
[02:46:15.865 --> 02:46:18.627]  Now, I want to hear about, because this, what I'm saying was in BBC...
[02:46:19.731 --> 02:46:29.293]  A bunch of other papers like three, four, five years ago, where it's said that they have police in restaurants listening for people making racial comments, even in their own conversations.
[02:46:29.313 --> 02:46:38.275]  I remember the BBC headline, something like, hundreds arrested in hate speech sweep, and it said that they raided homes of people that had been heard saying racist things.
[02:46:38.575 --> 02:46:39.856]  Are you saying that's not going on?
[02:46:40.736 --> 02:46:44.977]  Well, it's not going on in any sort of systematic way.
[02:46:45.644 --> 02:47:03.369]  I mean, the police do all sorts of... I mean, the police help landlords illegally evict people just because they don't know... No, I know, but I mean, did they go arrest Robin Page, BBC presenter of One Man and His Dog, for saying that rural communities deserve the same rights as gays and Muslims?
[02:47:05.069 --> 02:47:06.309]  I don't know about that story.
[02:47:06.489 --> 02:47:07.750]  I mean, I had him on.
[02:47:07.790 --> 02:47:08.490]  That was in the news.
[02:47:10.570 --> 02:47:12.311]  I don't know what he said, and I don't know...
[02:47:14.050 --> 02:47:15.570]  Well, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[02:47:15.710 --> 02:47:17.892]  You were right, and I actually Googled it while you were saying it.
[02:47:17.932 --> 02:47:19.172]  I got the two things mixed up.
[02:47:19.432 --> 02:47:20.993]  I tend to hurry up and oversimplify.
[02:47:21.253 --> 02:47:23.755]  And you're right about what you said about the EU presidency earlier.
[02:47:24.075 --> 02:47:26.276]  Not about the overall general, but you were disagreeing on that.
[02:47:26.496 --> 02:47:27.457]  You were right about that point.
[02:47:27.737 --> 02:47:30.778]  But I'm telling you, you're just like I'm not informed on a lot of stuff.
[02:47:31.038 --> 02:47:31.879]  Nobody can know everything.
[02:47:32.279 --> 02:47:33.220]  You're wrong about this.
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:41.444]  I don't know where you live or what you've seen in the news, but I've probably seen, I don't know, it might be a hundred articles about, you know, the thought crime groups.
[02:47:42.239 --> 02:47:43.820]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:47:44.561 --> 02:47:50.045]  I could walk down the street plus three police vans saying homosexual, homosexual, homosexual.
[02:47:51.927 --> 02:47:53.968]  I wouldn't be even questioned about that.
[02:47:54.028 --> 02:47:57.531]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:47:57.691 --> 02:48:02.314]  But as I say, I do agree with you that the police overstep themselves all the time.
[02:48:02.595 --> 02:48:02.795]  Yeah.
[02:48:03.135 --> 02:48:04.076]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[02:48:04.416 --> 02:48:09.400]  And you do agree the police are getting cameras that see through your clothes, just like they have in our airports, and they record you digitally on a hard drive.
[02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:10.010]  You know.
[02:48:36.472 --> 02:48:38.873]  All right, we'll jam in a few final calls in the final segment.
[02:48:39.193 --> 02:48:39.894]  Final segment.
[02:48:39.934 --> 02:48:40.394]  Stay with us.
[02:48:40.414 --> 02:48:40.954]  Stay the course.
[02:48:46.617 --> 02:48:48.038]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:49.098 --> 02:48:50.139]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.859 --> 02:48:54.861]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by powerful governments.
[02:48:54.881 --> 02:48:57.522]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:48:57.702 --> 02:49:00.804]  Was their objective being world domination?
[02:49:01.364 --> 02:49:03.765]  For thousands of years, their dark border grew.
[02:49:04.526 --> 02:49:11.872]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.877 --> 02:49:19.879]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.339 --> 02:49:23.800]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:26.721]  Build-A-Bear is making great progress toward a world of government.
[02:49:26.761 --> 02:49:27.922]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.942 --> 02:49:28.682]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.702 --> 02:49:29.762]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.002 --> 02:49:30.723]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.983 --> 02:49:31.983]  That's what they're after.
[02:49:32.123 --> 02:49:40.326]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:49:40.806 --> 02:49:41.566]  Endgame.
[02:49:41.606 --> 02:49:43.247]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.507 --> 02:49:45.990]  You have been warned.
[02:49:46.150 --> 02:49:52.076]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:49:52.196 --> 02:49:56.460]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:49:56.540 --> 02:50:04.027]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:50:04.548 --> 02:50:05.008]  We're good to go.
[02:50:05.028 --> 02:50:05.629]  We're good to go.
[02:50:30.546 --> 02:50:31.548]  We're good to go.
[02:50:46.118 --> 02:50:49.321]  Yes, there is an in-dash AM-FM shortwave radio.

[02:51:13.963 --> 02:51:15.524]  There's even an input to plug in an external source.

[02:51:27.070 --> 02:51:27.530]  We're good to go.
[02:51:57.657 --> 02:52:02.364]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[02:52:03.385 --> 02:52:07.711]  New proposals to fight global warming within civilization kill billions.
[02:52:07.731 --> 02:52:12.217]  I'm going to briefly blurb that and try to jam Todd, Toby, and Chris in.
[02:52:12.258 --> 02:52:13.099]  I don't know about Tony.
[02:52:14.603 --> 02:52:16.425]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[02:52:17.226 --> 02:52:19.689]  And then in five minutes the show restarts.
[02:52:19.729 --> 02:52:26.676]  The whole first hour we got into some really key info on the hundreds of drugs and thousands of chemicals in all major water supplies.
[02:52:27.177 --> 02:52:28.859]  Really important info if you missed it.
[02:52:29.514 --> 02:52:35.516]  Coming up in the first hour of the show that retransmits on a lot of AM and FM stations, but also at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:35.777 --> 02:52:36.957]  You've got to go to that stream.
[02:52:36.997 --> 02:52:39.678]  There's hundreds of streams all over the web of different shows, networks, stations.
[02:52:40.118 --> 02:52:44.860]  You go to InfoWars.com, and that's where you can hear the first hour if you missed it.
[02:52:44.980 --> 02:52:46.321]  Very important info.
[02:52:46.341 --> 02:52:50.303]  Or maybe you already heard it, but your neighbor, your friend, your family thinks the water's still clean.
[02:52:50.883 --> 02:52:51.663]  Tell them to tune in.
[02:52:51.683 --> 02:52:53.144]  Tell them to get a Berkey water filter, by the way.
[02:52:53.164 --> 02:52:56.285]  We've got links to where you can get those up on the site.
[02:52:57.168 --> 02:52:59.890]  Man, it feels good pointing people in the right direction.
[02:53:00.910 --> 02:53:02.632]  Interfood, best green food out there.
[02:53:02.652 --> 02:53:03.392]  I take it every day.
[02:53:03.732 --> 02:53:05.934]  Much of my office crew takes it.

[02:53:42.956 --> 02:53:43.397]  866-762-9238.
[02:53:44.037 --> 02:53:47.200]  Inner Food, a lot of great products.
[02:53:48.982 --> 02:53:50.864]  Man, I want to go to your calls, but I want to hit on this.
[02:53:52.768 --> 02:53:53.388]  Just briefly.
[02:53:53.488 --> 02:53:56.930]  New proposals to fight global warming would end civilization, kill billions.
[02:53:56.970 --> 02:53:59.691]  Paul Watson's going to join us for a full hour tomorrow to talk about this.
[02:54:00.131 --> 02:54:01.752]  Washington's been on for about six months, hasn't he?
[02:54:01.932 --> 02:54:03.012]  Get to hear the waddy tomorrow.
[02:54:03.492 --> 02:54:09.054]  Washington Post pushes Carnegie document that encourages near zero carbon output within decades.
[02:54:09.074 --> 02:54:10.375]  See, this is the control.
[02:54:11.551 --> 02:54:12.272]  Ratcheting it up.
[02:54:12.412 --> 02:54:13.072]  Regulatory.
[02:54:13.112 --> 02:54:14.033]  You're going to learn tomorrow.
[02:54:14.373 --> 02:54:15.254]  Full hour on that.
[02:54:15.274 --> 02:54:18.876]  Internet 2, doing a full hour later in the week, how they're going to try to kill the web.
[02:54:18.896 --> 02:54:22.138]  All right, I'm going to give each caller about 30 seconds, because I want you to be able to talk.
[02:54:22.158 --> 02:54:23.099]  I want to hear from you real quick.
[02:54:23.479 --> 02:54:25.260]  Todd in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:54:26.101 --> 02:54:26.821]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:27.041 --> 02:54:36.048]  I actually wanted to give a general warning for the Tampa area, but first I want to kind of brush on the fact that it's very important that we as a people cannot be scared and paranoid, or they have already won.
[02:54:36.248 --> 02:54:39.630]  So it's very important to get prepared, get informed, inform everybody.
[02:54:40.373 --> 02:54:42.455]  If everybody was as brave as you, it wouldn't be a problem.
[02:54:43.476 --> 02:54:44.537]  I'm not brave, man.
[02:54:44.577 --> 02:54:47.000]  When somebody corners me and starts pounding me, I fight back.
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:51.484]  You've got to, but if you ever fall off the spotlight, God help you.
[02:54:51.604 --> 02:54:54.387]  The general warnings for chemtrails in the North Tampa area.
[02:54:54.407 --> 02:55:00.673]  I live north of Tampa, and for the last two weeks, I've witnessed daily, mostly on the weekends, chemtrails.
[02:55:00.793 --> 02:55:04.777]  They come in a grid formation over a period of 45 minutes to an hour.
[02:55:05.882 --> 02:55:07.583]  And they stay for hours.
[02:55:07.643 --> 02:55:11.925]  They generally turn into a cloud within 30 or 45 minutes, and then you see the cloud drift away.
[02:55:11.945 --> 02:55:19.809]  I'm asking people in this area, everybody's here on vacation, it's a beautiful time of the year, go out to the beaches, take pictures, look north.
[02:55:19.869 --> 02:55:20.529]  Hey, keep educating.
[02:55:20.550 --> 02:55:22.591]  We're going to do some shows on Chemtrails soon.
[02:55:22.851 --> 02:55:24.712]  Toby in Maryland, you're on the air.
[02:55:25.352 --> 02:55:25.832]  Hi, Seth.
[02:55:26.913 --> 02:55:31.515]  My name's, as you know, my name's Toby, and I'm calling from, well, I guess I could call it Madison.
[02:55:32.419 --> 02:55:33.580]  In the street on a hill.
[02:55:33.940 --> 02:55:45.726]  I wanted to talk to you about, um, to be honest with you, I just wanted to call you and say I've been learning a lot thanks to you, and, um, this is really my first time, so I'm sorry.
[02:55:46.730 --> 02:55:48.191]  Well, listen, we're out of time.
[02:55:48.331 --> 02:55:51.312]  If you'll call me back tomorrow, we'll put you to the headline, okay, Toby?
[02:55:51.632 --> 02:55:52.393]  We're just out of here.
[02:55:52.453 --> 02:55:54.854]  Chris, Tony, others, call me tomorrow.
[02:55:54.894 --> 02:55:56.294]  You tell them, hey, we didn't get on.
[02:55:56.875 --> 02:55:59.636]  He keeps a list there, you know, the people that didn't get on, if you want.
[02:56:00.176 --> 02:56:01.637]  First up tomorrow, I promise.
[02:56:01.677 --> 02:56:02.317]  I apologize.
[02:56:02.757 --> 02:56:04.038]  Out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:04.058 --> 02:56:10.141]  We continue to try to empower you with the facts, tell you where to get the facts, so you can check it out for yourself and then to take action.
[02:56:11.434 --> 02:56:12.315]  Against the globalists.
[02:56:12.775 --> 02:56:14.176]  In closing, I'm a filmmaker.
[02:56:14.276 --> 02:56:15.717]  Endgame is out on DVD.
