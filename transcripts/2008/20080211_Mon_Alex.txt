[00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.251]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:11.732]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:13.392]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:17.753]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:22.294]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.298 --> 00:00:35.559]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:36.079]  Welcome.
[00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:38.220]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.422]  It is the 11th day of February 2008.
[00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:46.424]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:55.548]  I would like to hear from you today about what you think the direction of the Ron Paul presidential campaign should be, and also get your response to
[00:00:56.337 --> 00:01:04.200]  What's happening with the development that appears that we're going to have John McCain versus either Hillary or Barack Obama.
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:20.045]  I also want to go back over some of Ron Paul's quotes that he himself has put out and break down some of those.
[00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:29.250]  I mean, some people, I guess they read what Ron Paul has said and they have trouble understanding exactly what he's saying.
[00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:34.093]  The Congressman has stated that he's got, what, 50-something delegates?
[00:01:36.214 --> 00:01:37.895]  I've got the exact number here in my stack.
[00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:39.556]  McCain's got over 800.
[00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:44.259]  He needs 1,100 and something to lock up the nomination.
[00:01:49.483 --> 00:01:50.944]  So, what does that look like to you?
[00:01:51.664 --> 00:01:52.565]  I'm just asking you.
[00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:54.175]  What does that look like to you?
[00:01:54.795 --> 00:02:08.559]  A lot of people are saying that there's going to be a broker convention, but Ron Paul in a speech yesterday said that there was almost zero chance of that, and in something that he posted, a letter he wrote on his website, his presidential website, Friday, he said the same thing.
[00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.541]  So the only door that was open for him to have actually a chance to win would be a third-party run.
[00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:21.683]  But if he does that, then the Republicans will throw him out of the party with his congressional seat,
[00:02:22.947 --> 00:02:28.349]  And that is now contested, and he's in danger of losing that here in the state of Texas.
[00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.089]  So what would you like Ron Paul to do?
[00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.250]  Throw caution to the wind?
[00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.231]  That's probably what I would do, but I haven't served ten terms in Congress.
[00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:41.552]  Maybe Ron Paul knows more than I do.
[00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:50.895]  Throw caution to the wind, and run for president via a third-party ticket?
[00:02:53.587 --> 00:02:56.268]  What do you think about that?
[00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:56.688]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:57.348]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:57.428 --> 00:03:04.710]  Then I have headlines like this I want to get into today.
[00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.631]  Police set to search for guns at homes without warrants.
[00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:09.951]  It's the new America.
[00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:17.874]  You see, when they tell you they're just getting rid of the Bill of Rights for Al Qaeda, you better go read the definition of terrorist.
[00:03:17.974 --> 00:03:19.254]  It's any misdemeanor.
[00:03:19.835 --> 00:03:23.936]  There is no Bill of Rights and no Constitution, according to the crooks running our government.
[00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:25.917]  Study!
[00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.998]  Artificial sweeteners increase weight gain odds.
[00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:31.579]  Return the blackout.
[00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:35.501]  Crime fear as councils switch off street lights to save the planet.
[00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:38.201]  We'll break down exactly what they're doing there.
[00:03:39.442 --> 00:03:39.702]  U.S.
[00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:44.124]  charges six suspects over 9-11 is calling for the death penalty.
[00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:48.165]  Six years later, people in custody for six years being tortured half to death.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.904]  After six years of brainwashing and torture, they're going to come out and give us a big line of bull now.
[00:03:54.965 --> 00:04:03.832]  And all the debunkers of 9-11 truth will point their finger at us and say, Habib Ahmed, or Akhman Jahani, says that he did it!
[00:04:03.852 --> 00:04:07.134]  Remember the last guy that confessed?
[00:04:07.154 --> 00:04:10.077]  He confessed to bombing buildings that didn't exist when he was arrested?
[00:04:10.737 --> 00:04:14.640]  He confessed to murders that happened while he was already in custody?
[00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.182]  They don't care!
[00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:17.863]  They'll feed the public that!
[00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:20.400]  Because they don't care, folks!
[00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:28.626]  The general public just hears that somebody confessed, they can't even pronounce their name, and that's the end of it.
[00:04:30.727 --> 00:04:33.750]  But don't think you slack-jawed know-it-alls you get away with that.
[00:04:35.991 --> 00:04:37.572]  Don't think you get away with that for a minute.
[00:04:38.813 --> 00:04:44.217]  You think you can just go through life being ignorant as a stone, dumb as a rock, and you're going to have some great life?
[00:04:44.297 --> 00:04:44.717]  Oh, no.
[00:04:45.838 --> 00:04:46.779]  You're going to get roasted.
[00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:49.393]  Roasted financially, everything else.
[00:04:49.854 --> 00:04:54.203]  So go ahead, you beady-eyed people out there that think this is all funny.
[00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:57.049]  Go ahead and laugh your way to hell.
[00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.271]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:09.743]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:05:10.223 --> 00:05:13.343]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:06:03.264 --> 00:06:05.385]  A new world order.
[00:06:06.105 --> 00:06:10.266]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:19.043]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[00:06:19.784 --> 00:06:27.110]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.101]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:35.581 --> 00:06:39.062]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:39.442 --> 00:06:41.943]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:43.163]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:43.183 --> 00:06:43.923]  They're not after money.
[00:06:43.943 --> 00:06:45.003]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:45.223 --> 00:06:45.963]  They're after power.
[00:06:46.203 --> 00:06:47.224]  That's what I have to do, sir.

[00:06:55.685 --> 00:06:58.386]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:58.866 --> 00:07:00.047]  You have been warned.
[00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:10.612]  Since the year 2000, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, tsunamis, floods, fires and hurricanes have killed over 1 million people worldwide and forced tens of millions to go without food and water.
[00:07:10.792 --> 00:07:14.834]  After Katrina, the media was eager to show victims in New Orleans begging for food.
[00:07:14.974 --> 00:07:19.696]  If a disaster strikes you and your loved ones and you have no stored food, you'll be begging as well.
[00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:25.859]  Now our economy is slipping into an abyss that even Donald Trump says will make the Great Depression look like a Sunday picnic.
[00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:26.519]  The U.S.
[00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:29.221]  dollar is worth less today than it was even last week.
[00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:35.564]  Before food prices skyrocket, trucks stop running, and stores close their doors, Survival Enterprises can help you prepare.

[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.242]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913.
[00:08:08.282 --> 00:08:11.965]  Made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[00:08:23.955 --> 00:08:27.576]  A hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid.
[00:08:29.257 --> 00:08:32.718]  So, Cyrus Jones, live forever.
[00:08:34.398 --> 00:08:44.981]  Grave digger, when you dig my grave, would you make it shallow so I can feel the rain?
[00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:45.842]  Grave digger,
[00:08:55.325 --> 00:08:58.968]  You're a snowball, 1903 to 1954.
[00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.013]  She lost both of her babies in the Second Great War.
[00:09:05.654 --> 00:09:10.619]  Now, you should never have to watch your only children lowered in the ground.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.984]  I mean, you should never have to bury your own babies.
[00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:20.948]  Great Digger, when you did my day,
[00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:31.155]  Could you make it shallow, so that I can feel the rain, rain bigger?
[00:09:31.415 --> 00:09:40.663]  Ring around the rosy, pocket full of posies
[00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:56.200]  Yeah, that's Willie Nelson with his new single.
[00:10:18.115 --> 00:10:19.176]  No, it's not a single.
[00:10:19.276 --> 00:10:29.462]  It's a single in that it's a music video, but it's one of the covers for his new mega-album with over 100 tracks on it.
[00:10:31.183 --> 00:10:31.663]  Okay.
[00:10:33.684 --> 00:10:38.687]  Look, here's the bottom line, and I say this a lot, and it's because it's constantly on my mind.
[00:10:40.208 --> 00:10:44.951]  I literally, literally have
[00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:55.882]  200 plus news articles, every one of which is earth-shakingly bad.
[00:10:56.762 --> 00:11:00.764]  Every one of them is just amazing police state.
[00:11:01.784 --> 00:11:04.485]  And I haven't mentioned in the last week 10% of them.
[00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:14.288]  And I haven't given proper time to every facet of just how bad this is and just how incredible
[00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:15.461]  This is.
[00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:26.584]  I mean, they are openly dismantling the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, in front of us, and going to hard tyranny right in front of our eyes.
[00:11:29.964 --> 00:11:34.005]  And every indicator is, the New World Order is going to go for broke.
[00:11:40.187 --> 00:11:41.887]  When I think about the fact that
[00:11:43.121 --> 00:11:46.082]  All over the nation, police are going to people's doors.
[00:11:47.862 --> 00:11:53.164]  They're in the middle of the day and knocking on the door and saying, mind if we come in and do a home safety inspection of your firearms?
[00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:54.724]  Now that's what they actually say.
[00:11:56.385 --> 00:12:02.907]  The news tells you they go to high crime areas and knock on doors and ask if they can come search for illegal guns, randomly.
[00:12:04.627 --> 00:12:08.628]  That's bad enough, in a total violation of the Fourth Amendment, and they admit it is.
[00:12:08.668 --> 00:12:10.329]  They say, oh well we asked for entry.
[00:12:11.707 --> 00:12:16.609]  When I first learned to knock and talk six years ago, the first place I saw it was in Tucson, Arizona.
[00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:21.650]  And we read the excerpts out of the paper we had guests on.
[00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:24.591]  It was middle upper class areas.
[00:12:27.252 --> 00:12:29.113]  Middle to upper middle class neighborhoods.
[00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:35.015]  And they go knock on the door and they intimidate the woman or the maid or the nanny.
[00:12:35.035 --> 00:12:36.115]  It doesn't matter who answers.
[00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:37.576]  They target women.
[00:12:38.419 --> 00:12:41.661]  And they say, let us come in and look for illegal guns, let us do a safety inspection.
[00:12:42.901 --> 00:12:46.143]  And now I got the Dallas Morning News three years ago reporting it.
[00:12:46.183 --> 00:12:47.884]  And I've seen hundreds of these things.
[00:12:47.964 --> 00:12:52.046]  I've seen them every few weeks for the last six years, and I frankly am sick of it.
[00:12:53.547 --> 00:12:59.510]  You're dirtbag criminals when you go to people's doors and say, mind if I come in and search for guns?
[00:13:01.821 --> 00:13:10.045]  Now for 15 years they've been having gun buybacks with the news cameras showing people lined up from Austin, Texas to Tennessee, New York.
[00:13:10.085 --> 00:13:10.885]  They do it everywhere.
[00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:14.327]  With the news images of people lined up handing their guns in for money.
[00:13:14.747 --> 00:13:17.088]  They got billboards up all over the U.S.
[00:13:17.228 --> 00:13:17.688]  right now.
[00:13:18.668 --> 00:13:24.731]  There's two of them within a mile from where I sit saying, report illegal guns with a revolver aimed at you.
[00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:26.552]  And then when an idiot carpet cleaner
[00:13:27.717 --> 00:13:33.200]  Or a repairman is at your house and he sees a revolver in a case on the wall, he calls the cops on you.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.321]  And let me tell you something, the cops come!
[00:13:41.244 --> 00:13:43.425]  I got police training videos.
[00:13:47.047 --> 00:13:53.330]  I've got the police training manuals where it says if somebody's wearing blue jeans and they've got a cell phone, go ahead and call anti-terror forces on them.
[00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.572]  If somebody's got a road almanac in their car, go ahead and call the police on them.
[00:13:57.682 --> 00:14:06.350]  I mean, they're turning this into a total paranoid, schizophrenic society with all these bootlickers, tattletales running around just tattling on everybody.
[00:14:08.753 --> 00:14:11.055]  And if you're worried about a real threat, the borders are wide open.
[00:14:14.038 --> 00:14:15.680]  And frankly, I want to talk about Ron Paul.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.421]  Frankly, I want to talk about the economy.
[00:14:17.722 --> 00:14:19.343]  I want to talk about what's happening militarily.
[00:14:19.663 --> 00:14:21.205]  And now a sixth cable cut.
[00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:33.057]  As they poke the eyes out of the Arabs and the Central Asians, which is always a prelude to massive bombardment.
[00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:38.120]  I mean, you talk about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.903]  They massed two aircraft carrier groups, over 40,000 U.S.
[00:14:43.943 --> 00:14:45.304]  troops, over 18,000 British troops,
[00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.311]  And Bush signed the launch order to attack them the day before 9-11.
[00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:52.691]  How obvious do these people have to get?
[00:14:52.952 --> 00:14:57.573]  And now they're massing right now in the Middle East and Central Asia to start World War III.
[00:15:00.654 --> 00:15:04.215]  Which makes me think they may blow something up or claim terrorists hit us.
[00:15:05.535 --> 00:15:05.955]  Any minute.
[00:15:10.497 --> 00:15:11.337]  You know why I'm mad?
[00:15:11.357 --> 00:15:12.818]  You know why I'm in such a nasty mood?
[00:15:13.318 --> 00:15:17.539]  I was in such a nasty mood yesterday that I almost didn't do my Sunday show.
[00:15:19.278 --> 00:15:28.304]  It was like pulling teeth, and I normally enjoy doing my radio broadcast, but things are so serious, they are so bad, that I, again, don't have words to describe it.
[00:15:33.548 --> 00:15:37.050]  We got cops all over the country running around taking people's DNA at checkpoints.
[00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:38.752]  It isn't just in Florida.
[00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:47.117]  I mean, what am I going to do when some moron, and you are, you're a moron, pulls me over and wants some of my DNA.
[00:15:47.137 --> 00:15:47.618]  I mean, this is...
[00:15:48.397 --> 00:15:51.578]  This isn't just show your papers, it's give us your fluids!
[00:15:53.298 --> 00:15:54.478]  I can't take it anymore!
[00:15:54.818 --> 00:15:56.359]  This isn't America, you idiots!
[00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:01.840]  I'm going to make this point a lot, but I'm going to try to make it real clear to you today.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.701]  To police especially, because tyranny will come to your door in a uniform.
[00:16:07.561 --> 00:16:09.081]  That's the way it works in history.
[00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:14.282]  Whether you like it or not, and whether you ever figure it out or not, whether it ever
[00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:18.264]  Connects in your brain that light bulb goes off above your head.
[00:16:18.284 --> 00:16:19.304]  You need to know this.
[00:16:20.165 --> 00:16:23.026]  You're in the same boat as us, buddy.
[00:16:23.827 --> 00:16:24.187]  Jack.
[00:16:26.208 --> 00:16:32.372]  You're working for a scientifically developed, over a hundred years, dictatorship.
[00:16:33.553 --> 00:16:41.097]  The private bankers that took over our Federal Reserve and had Europe under their control by 1815, way before our Federal Reserve, and who now dominate
[00:16:41.903 --> 00:16:43.143]  But a handful of nations.
[00:16:43.763 --> 00:16:45.844]  They dominate every country in the world but a handful.
[00:16:48.745 --> 00:16:50.205]  And I'm not saying those nations are good.
[00:16:50.565 --> 00:16:51.245]  Humans are evil.
[00:16:51.966 --> 00:16:52.806]  Governments are wicked.
[00:16:53.186 --> 00:16:56.367]  And so they can always point their finger at these other evil governments and say, look, we're good.
[00:16:56.607 --> 00:16:57.407]  No, they're all bad.
[00:17:01.788 --> 00:17:04.329]  Ahmed Dinegi was calling for world government two weeks ago.
[00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.530]  They all want the same thing.
[00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:14.278]  But I want to tell the police and military and everybody else something.
[00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.000]  You're under attack every day.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.844]  You think I just get up here and I tell them, I tell you they're putting poison in your water for fun.
[00:17:21.864 --> 00:17:22.724]  You think that's fun?
[00:17:23.665 --> 00:17:25.006]  You think it's fun getting up here?
[00:17:25.026 --> 00:17:29.209]  I may not even be able to do the show.
[00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:30.150]  I'm just so mad.
[00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.552]  I just can't help it.
[00:17:32.592 --> 00:17:33.873]  I am so angry.
[00:17:40.788 --> 00:17:41.708]  You know why I'm angry?
[00:17:41.768 --> 00:17:45.150]  Because I want to enjoy my life and I can't enjoy my life.
[00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:56.234]  I can't enjoy camping or fishing or doing anything now because I know hanging over me is a bunch of murder and terrorists that run the government and run the corporations and run our society.
[00:17:57.375 --> 00:17:59.376]  And the private banks took over and they were smart.
[00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:05.358]  They went and hired the best sociologist, the best psychologist, the best psychiatrist, the best PR propagandist.
[00:18:06.542 --> 00:18:12.568]  And they dumbed the population down, and they have set up a scientific dictatorship, and they're turning the grid on right now.
[00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:23.317]  And they're going to do everything we've warned you about, everything that the old-timers warned you about, because they worked in the government, and they came out and warned you 50 years ago.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.901]  That time is now.
[00:18:27.742 --> 00:18:29.223]  All of it's coming together right now.
[00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:45.112]  And I just think about cops all over the country being told to go to people's doors and try to push their way into the house randomly to search for guns.
[00:18:46.232 --> 00:18:51.255]  This country is just so gone, so far gone, and this isn't even the start.
[00:18:52.235 --> 00:18:54.896]  We haven't even begun to slide down into the cesspit.
[00:18:55.597 --> 00:18:56.857]  And I don't want to be part of this.
[00:18:56.997 --> 00:18:59.679]  I don't like what's happening to my country that my family lives in.
[00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:04.041]  I don't like that the whole world is in the grasp of this beast system.
[00:19:07.463 --> 00:19:10.745]  And even if you don't believe in God, I just want to tell you the old cliché rings true.
[00:19:11.045 --> 00:19:12.665]  There are no atheists in foxholes.
[00:19:13.606 --> 00:19:15.887]  Even if you don't believe in good and evil, it's real.
[00:19:20.069 --> 00:19:20.629]  And it's here.
[00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.130]  And they're pulling out all the stops.
[00:19:25.491 --> 00:19:26.072]  You know what I'm going to do?
[00:19:26.092 --> 00:19:26.732]  I'm going to settle down.
[00:19:28.813 --> 00:19:30.594]  And I'm going to come back and I'm going to take your phone calls.
[00:19:33.695 --> 00:19:34.896]  I'm going to take your phone calls.
[00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:37.849]  For a while, then I'm just going to go to the news.
[00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:40.710]  And boy, is there a lot of it.
[00:19:43.972 --> 00:19:45.353]  I'm just tired of evil winning.
[00:19:46.413 --> 00:19:48.194]  I'm tired of corruption growing.
[00:19:49.295 --> 00:19:51.616]  I'm tired of threats to my liberty and my future.
[00:19:52.476 --> 00:19:53.477]  And my children's future.
[00:19:56.118 --> 00:19:57.018]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:19:57.038 --> 00:19:59.219]  We're going to break down the enemy's operations today.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.260]  Stay with me.
[00:20:03.024 --> 00:20:05.085]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.725 --> 00:20:14.629]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:22.272]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.998 --> 00:20:28.483]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.983 --> 00:20:39.793]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.655]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:43.136 --> 00:20:44.657]  For more information, call 702-953-ZX.
[00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:56.573]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:57.073 --> 00:20:58.594]  A new world order.
[00:20:58.774 --> 00:21:07.079]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:07.239 --> 00:21:13.203]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:21:14.264 --> 00:21:16.525]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:17.065 --> 00:21:19.467]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:20.209 --> 00:21:27.564]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:30.572 --> 00:21:35.576]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:36.036 --> 00:21:39.498]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:41.979]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.600]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.341]  They're not after money.
[00:21:44.361 --> 00:21:45.482]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.682 --> 00:21:46.462]  They're after policy.
[00:21:46.662 --> 00:21:47.683]  That's what they're after.

[00:22:06.154 --> 00:22:12.057]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[00:22:12.697 --> 00:22:21.982]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by Communist and Marxist members of the Council on Foreign Relations, whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?

[00:24:01.834 --> 00:24:11.197]  I know why a lot of people tune into this radio show and they hear the things we're talking about.
[00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.792]  And they just decide to say it isn't true and I'm a liar.
[00:24:36.234 --> 00:24:37.735]  Believe me, I know why you do that.
[00:24:39.336 --> 00:24:42.018]  Because deep down inside, you know I'm telling you the truth.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.802]  Deep down inside, you know we're all under great threat.
[00:24:47.623 --> 00:24:50.646]  And the propagandists know that you instinctively know you're under threat.
[00:24:51.066 --> 00:24:57.772]  So they take that well-founded, instinctive fear that you have in the pit of your stomach and they say, oh, you're scared because of Al-Qaeda.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.341]  But everybody deep down knows that's not the real threat, that's a manufactured threat.
[00:25:06.223 --> 00:25:07.963]  I'm gonna try to lay it out today.
[00:25:08.383 --> 00:25:14.626]  What we face, what the odds are, where things are going in the future.
[00:25:17.947 --> 00:25:21.828]  We got Judge Andrew Napolitano coming on who talks about how we're going into a police state.
[00:25:22.448 --> 00:25:24.069]  His new book, he'll be popping in with us.
[00:25:26.577 --> 00:25:29.198]  Right now, as promised, let's go to your calls, but just understand this.
[00:25:29.218 --> 00:25:30.419]  I'm going to move through your calls quickly.
[00:25:31.099 --> 00:25:32.499]  John in the UK, welcome.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.640]  Hi, Alex.
[00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:40.523]  God bless you, Alex, from the UK, and thanks for giving us a chance to speak to you now.
[00:25:42.223 --> 00:25:52.547]  I'm ringing up about the rumpled revolution and a little bit of agony over all of this, you know, just what's going on and what's happened recently in the last couple of days.
[00:25:55.103 --> 00:26:09.154]  I'm ringing up because, you know, I need to flesh out a little bit, you know, a little bit of context here is that we absolutely believe we know to be true and proven to be true all the things that you're saying.
[00:26:09.194 --> 00:26:10.415]  We're totally on your side.
[00:26:10.455 --> 00:26:12.036]  We're totally on the Truth Movement side.
[00:26:12.076 --> 00:26:21.623]  We are Truth Movement people and we're getting ready, you know, to take on this fight and to sort the New World Order and we're trying to organize our strategy.
[00:26:22.363 --> 00:26:23.024]  Then we see
[00:26:25.322 --> 00:26:29.105]  You know, Alex Jones, we love what he says because he tells the truth.
[00:26:29.465 --> 00:26:32.887]  You know, he's one of the few people doing that.
[00:26:32.967 --> 00:26:33.488]  We hear it.
[00:26:33.548 --> 00:26:34.108]  We love it.
[00:26:34.708 --> 00:26:37.630]  And then he tells us that Rumpole is the man.
[00:26:38.051 --> 00:26:40.392]  And then Rumpole speaks Jefferson.
[00:26:40.592 --> 00:26:41.693]  We love Jefferson.
[00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.615]  You know, we lay down our lives for the truth.
[00:26:44.655 --> 00:26:46.977]  We care about the orphan and the widow.
[00:26:47.957 --> 00:26:51.860]  And then all of a sudden they go on and there's a Dear John letter on there.
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.402]  You know, well, what a year.
[00:26:55.117 --> 00:26:56.698]  Thanks a lot, guys.
[00:26:56.898 --> 00:26:57.698]  What can you do?
[00:26:57.718 --> 00:27:01.900]  I've got to go back to Texas and sort this out.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.940]  And then, you know how to read.
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.041]  You know what that means.
[00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:09.022]  Anybody who has an intellect would understand it.
[00:27:09.342 --> 00:27:15.905]  Then a bunch of other Ron Paul supporters read it and say, oh no, this means the campaign goes forward in presidential run.
[00:27:16.445 --> 00:27:20.607]  And then they all get confused by it.
[00:27:23.291 --> 00:27:25.292]  Just break down the factors, okay?
[00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:35.778]  He is going with the safe route to try to save his congressional seat, while at the same time he knows that there is a slight chance that McCain could self-destruct, a big scandal could come out.
[00:27:36.278 --> 00:27:41.881]  McCain has a lot of skeletons, so he's staying in because it's not 100% that he's going to lose.
[00:27:42.382 --> 00:27:44.423]  But with McCain with 719 delegates, he only needs 1,191.
[00:27:44.523 --> 00:27:45.603]  And we've got Ron Paul,
[00:27:52.961 --> 00:27:56.102]  With just a fraction of those, and we don't even have 50.
[00:27:58.103 --> 00:28:02.665]  And so... I mean, look at the numbers.
[00:28:02.705 --> 00:28:03.505]  Look at the math.
[00:28:05.246 --> 00:28:05.826]  They cheated.
[00:28:06.026 --> 00:28:07.907]  The media didn't give him attention.
[00:28:07.947 --> 00:28:09.227]  We know there was election fraud.
[00:28:09.988 --> 00:28:18.011]  And so, Ron Paul really couldn't be criticized if he dropped out of the Republican Party and ran as an independent.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:31.051]  But he knows that that is a slight chance, and so he's doing the safe thing, but he wants to try to save face for all of us, and so he says, but I'm still going to, in a limited capacity, stay in the presidential run.
[00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:34.954]  I mean, it is the shrewd, safe path to take.
[00:28:36.129 --> 00:28:42.914]  I personally would probably stay in, run as a third party, counting on the massive grassroots and fundraising.
[00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:50.980]  As long as people knew that he was still giving fight, you would see the numbers, the money keep pouring in, and then he would be there to inject real issues into the debate.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.741]  He'd be there in the national debates.
[00:28:54.696 --> 00:28:55.777]  I mean, that's basically it.
[00:28:56.358 --> 00:28:58.340]  If I really broke all this down, it would take a full hour.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.642]  I mean, do you want me to?
[00:28:59.662 --> 00:29:04.908]  Do you want me to not... No, what I want to do is get a chance to speak, Alex, and respect what you say.
[00:29:04.928 --> 00:29:05.869]  Go ahead, you've got the floor.
[00:29:05.889 --> 00:29:06.389]  Go ahead.
[00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:07.530]  And reply to it.
[00:29:08.211 --> 00:29:14.258]  Is that, from where we're standing, where we're watching, and where we're active, you know, in our own way in the truth movement,
[00:29:15.629 --> 00:29:25.476]  Finding every which way that we can go forward, you know, against the Rand Corporation, against the billions of pounds that think tank against us, and all that is, all that you know about.
[00:29:26.677 --> 00:29:37.866]  I see that when we was promised that Ron Paul would run, the whole world got behind him, let alone, you know, because of Jefferson, because of Ron Paul, because of them through.
[00:29:38.954 --> 00:29:43.078]  And that's the only reason why we're all totally behind him.
[00:29:43.278 --> 00:29:46.020]  And we feel that that was endorsed by Alex Jones.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:46.500]  Stay there!
[00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:48.562]  I'll let you finish up when we get back on the other side.
[00:29:52.005 --> 00:29:52.966]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.386 --> 00:29:55.008]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.928 --> 00:29:58.611]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.838 --> 00:30:02.498]  It's a fact.
[00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:10.182]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:30:10.302 --> 00:30:17.005]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debts.
[00:30:17.005 --> 00:30:17.485]  I'm good.
[00:30:36.523 --> 00:30:41.548]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:30:41.728 --> 00:30:46.232]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:30:46.372 --> 00:30:48.173]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:30:48.233 --> 00:30:48.414]  That's 877-943-8600.

[00:30:50.135 --> 00:30:50.836]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:31:01.758 --> 00:31:03.239]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.

[00:31:13.547 --> 00:31:14.067]  What happened?
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:14.680]  I don't know.
[00:31:33.473 --> 00:31:37.355]  The last word monastery is spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[00:31:37.676 --> 00:31:38.156]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.

[00:31:41.558 --> 00:31:45.261]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:31:45.581 --> 00:31:46.782]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:01.880]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:07.722]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[00:32:08.343 --> 00:32:14.105]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[00:32:14.845 --> 00:32:18.106]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[00:32:18.746 --> 00:32:22.028]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[00:32:22.628 --> 00:32:25.929]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[00:32:26.613 --> 00:32:31.117]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[00:32:31.837 --> 00:32:33.819]  We will still have two regrets.
[00:32:34.479 --> 00:32:37.822]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[00:32:38.503 --> 00:32:41.385]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[00:32:42.166 --> 00:32:49.011]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[00:32:49.772 --> 00:32:50.052]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:50.132 --> 00:32:51.193]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:56.764 --> 00:32:57.705]  We're good to go.
[00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.731]  Friday 11 a.m.
[00:33:31.751 --> 00:33:32.091]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:32.131 --> 00:33:33.132]  We're here live!
[00:33:33.292 --> 00:33:36.294]  You can't live until you try.
[00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:38.916]  You can't live until you die.
[00:33:39.296 --> 00:33:43.739]  You can't learn to tell the truth until you learn to lie.
[00:33:43.779 --> 00:33:46.761]  Can't breathe until you choke.
[00:33:47.001 --> 00:33:49.283]  If you gotta laugh then you're the joke.
[00:33:49.323 --> 00:33:54.246]  There's nothing like a funeral to make you feel alive.
[00:34:09.744 --> 00:34:10.145]  Yeah!
[00:34:27.348 --> 00:34:29.731]  I know some things that you don't.
[00:34:29.831 --> 00:34:31.713]  I've done things that you won't.
[00:34:31.813 --> 00:34:37.419]  It's nothing like a trail of blood to find your way back home.
[00:34:37.499 --> 00:34:43.405]  I was waiting for my curse, thinking it was so much worse.
[00:34:43.625 --> 00:34:47.810]  It took us in a row to make me feel alright.
[00:34:58.145 --> 00:35:04.050]  Look, I'm upset about the New World Order.
[00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:08.533]  I'm angry about how fast they're moving and how openly wicked they are.
[00:35:09.294 --> 00:35:17.280]  And that all our suspicions about them, all the documents, all the blueprints, all the plans they laid out, is exactly what they're following and they mean to do it all.
[00:35:18.658 --> 00:35:28.867]  The world government, the mass exterminations, they bought off our preachers, they bought off our governments, they bought off most of the media, and they're moving, and they're moving fast, and they are extremely dark.
[00:35:29.768 --> 00:35:45.682]  Now, before I go back to you, John, I've got to move quicker here through the calls, but I'm trying to not cut you short here, is that I'm kind of hearing an indictment of, Alex Jones said get behind Ron Paul, and I did get behind Ron Paul, and then I'm going to hear what you're upset about, but listen!
[00:35:46.423 --> 00:35:47.824]  We have to keep our chin up.
[00:35:47.885 --> 00:35:49.106]  We have to stay focused.
[00:35:49.326 --> 00:35:49.906]  I have to.
[00:35:50.687 --> 00:35:54.111]  Even though I'm trying to be positive about this, I'm upset too, okay?
[00:35:55.072 --> 00:35:57.174]  But that's only about 10% of why I'm upset.
[00:35:57.214 --> 00:35:58.595]  I'm upset about everything else.
[00:35:59.135 --> 00:36:00.397]  They're pulling the stops out.
[00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:01.798]  There's going to be a lot of defeats.
[00:36:02.499 --> 00:36:04.441]  There's going to be a lot of bad things that happen.
[00:36:04.821 --> 00:36:06.683]  That's why I never wanted to be a leader.
[00:36:06.743 --> 00:36:08.164]  I've never wanted to be your leader.
[00:36:08.505 --> 00:36:09.666]  Because they can set me up.
[00:36:09.706 --> 00:36:10.707]  They can lie about me.
[00:36:11.562 --> 00:36:13.023]  They can twist things I've done.
[00:36:13.363 --> 00:36:14.723]  They can destroy my name.
[00:36:15.223 --> 00:36:21.345]  They could take me and put me in jail for six years and then put me out on trial and I confess to torture, you name it.
[00:36:22.306 --> 00:36:24.406]  I would confess because of torture.
[00:36:24.847 --> 00:36:28.288]  I would confess to just anything they told me to.
[00:36:29.328 --> 00:36:35.050]  And that's why this has to be a leaderless resistance with all of us being leaders basically.
[00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:37.951]  Now look, I think personally
[00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:41.403]  That Ron Paul should run third party.
[00:36:42.644 --> 00:36:44.226]  I think he's got the political muscle.
[00:36:44.386 --> 00:36:46.468]  I know he has the grassroots and the money.
[00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:49.531]  Now, I've said that.
[00:36:50.492 --> 00:36:52.394]  But that's from my limited perspective.
[00:36:53.896 --> 00:36:57.579]  Uh, and, you know, maybe 55% of me wants him to run third party.
[00:36:57.719 --> 00:37:00.581]  I can certainly see why he isn't doing that.
[00:37:00.681 --> 00:37:02.223]  I certainly understand that.
[00:37:02.663 --> 00:37:05.245]  Listen, let me just read to you the facts, okay?
[00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:09.168]  AP, Paul vows to remain a Republican in race.
[00:37:09.768 --> 00:37:11.950]  Presidential hopeful Ron Paul said he will not
[00:37:12.998 --> 00:37:14.539]  Ron is a third-party candidate.
[00:37:14.719 --> 00:37:15.699]  That's the bad news.
[00:37:15.739 --> 00:37:16.519]  He shut the door on that.
[00:37:16.539 --> 00:37:21.441]  And a new message to supporters that seems to recognize the slim chances of getting a Republican nomination.
[00:37:21.701 --> 00:37:30.684]  The Texas congressman wrote on his website Friday that he is making cuts to his national campaign staff and that he must also stay focused on not losing the primary for his House seat.
[00:37:31.324 --> 00:37:37.086]  Paul began Saturday with just 14 delegates from the Republican nomination that John McCain with 719
[00:37:39.275 --> 00:37:40.836]  Has all but officially secured.
[00:37:41.016 --> 00:37:46.718]  Mitt Romney dropped out of the race Thursday, and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee has 198 delegates.
[00:37:47.099 --> 00:37:52.501]  A total of 1,191 delegates are needed to secure the Republican nomination.
[00:37:53.421 --> 00:37:56.423]  Couple more primaries and McCain is gonna have it locked in.
[00:37:57.163 --> 00:37:57.483]  Okay?
[00:37:58.484 --> 00:38:01.085]  Now, I'm gonna just say this for those that don't understand.
[00:38:02.906 --> 00:38:05.807]  Actually, Paul Watson and I wrote a story on this.
[00:38:09.096 --> 00:38:14.579]  And I read this in its entirety on the show Sunday.
[00:38:14.599 --> 00:38:16.579]  It's here in my stack.
[00:38:16.599 --> 00:38:18.180]  I just can't keep track of all this stuff.
[00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:21.362]  And I could go over the four different options that Ron Paul had.
[00:38:21.422 --> 00:38:22.602]  Now, you pick one.
[00:38:22.682 --> 00:38:23.583]  You pick an option.
[00:38:25.283 --> 00:38:26.384]  Third party, yes.
[00:38:26.464 --> 00:38:31.486]  But as soon as he did that, they'll kick him out of the Republican Party and he will almost assuredly lose his House seat.
[00:38:32.967 --> 00:38:36.469]  Now that's throwing caution to the wind and I'd probably do that.
[00:38:36.529 --> 00:38:37.109]  I'm reckless.
[00:38:38.689 --> 00:38:40.730]  But I cannot get mad at Ron Paul.
[00:38:41.631 --> 00:38:42.651]  We asked him to run.
[00:38:42.712 --> 00:38:43.412]  He didn't want to run.
[00:38:43.452 --> 00:38:44.653]  I talked to him privately.
[00:38:46.254 --> 00:38:50.316]  You know, it's like Willie Nelson gets on this show and says he's a big fan, been listening for years, loves my films.
[00:38:50.756 --> 00:38:53.618]  I didn't come on air and tell you about that beforehand, before he was on air.
[00:38:55.459 --> 00:38:57.341]  Because I don't like to sit here and toot horns.
[00:38:57.361 --> 00:38:59.582]  Well, it's the same thing with Ron Paul.
[00:39:00.062 --> 00:39:05.145]  Then he comes on the air and he says, yeah, about half my support from your show, and you personally pushed me to run.
[00:39:05.165 --> 00:39:07.827]  And he said, now that's on record.
[00:39:09.602 --> 00:39:12.903]  And so, you know, yeah, am I guilty here?
[00:39:13.003 --> 00:39:14.063]  I pushed Ron Paul to run.
[00:39:14.083 --> 00:39:15.383]  A lot of other prominent people did.
[00:39:15.423 --> 00:39:16.524]  We said we were going to support him.
[00:39:17.664 --> 00:39:26.686]  Now that he's licking his wounds, at least he's saying he's going to stay in and sees what happens because there's this limited chance that McCain will blow up or some scandal will come out or something's going to happen.
[00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:30.247]  Did he close the two big windows he had?
[00:39:31.627 --> 00:39:35.488]  Well, one big window was third-party, very tiny window, impossible window.
[00:39:37.524 --> 00:39:38.505]  of Broker Convention.
[00:39:38.565 --> 00:39:44.589]  I mean, I was telling you last week, listeners, everybody was running around about Broker Convention, Broker Convention, and I just said, you can't do that.
[00:39:44.889 --> 00:39:53.194]  You can't do that when you've got 14 delegates and McCain's got 700 and something.
[00:39:53.454 --> 00:39:55.375]  No doubt he'll lock it up very soon.
[00:39:55.776 --> 00:39:56.436]  What, Ron Paul?
[00:39:56.456 --> 00:40:00.218]  We're just going to magically have Ron Paul delegates go claim that we're going for Ron Paul?
[00:40:00.499 --> 00:40:02.000]  The media will have a field day with that.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.101]  It's just not reality-based.
[00:40:05.023 --> 00:40:06.764]  But people love instant fixes.
[00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:09.266]  They love things that seem like they're magic bullets.
[00:40:09.326 --> 00:40:10.387]  Okay, I said I'd take your calls.
[00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:21.274]  But we have to be positive now and try to get the Ron Paul revolution, as it's called, to be the freedom revolution.
[00:40:21.615 --> 00:40:25.297]  And we need goals immediately for these meetup groups.
[00:40:25.337 --> 00:40:28.600]  To expose Hillary and McCain as being in business together.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:34.564]  To expose Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and Coulter for being behind Hillary.
[00:40:36.084 --> 00:40:42.186]  The fact that we should just boycott this whole election, it's a fraud, drive Congress's approval rating down to 5% instead of 11.
[00:40:43.587 --> 00:40:45.567]  You're gonna call me and say, wait, AP says it's 20.
[00:40:45.907 --> 00:40:49.549]  AP did a national poll and it showed 20% and they call that an all-time low.
[00:40:49.869 --> 00:40:51.869]  Gallup did one six months ago and it showed 11%.
[00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:56.271]  Whatever it is, 11, 20, whatever, it's very low, the lowest in history.
[00:40:57.822 --> 00:41:00.225]  We need to continue to fight to secure our borders.
[00:41:00.445 --> 00:41:02.367]  Continue to fight to secure the Second Amendment.
[00:41:02.727 --> 00:41:08.273]  We need these meet-up groups in California and Texas and New York and Missouri and Florida and every other state.
[00:41:08.734 --> 00:41:10.636]  Tens of thousands of people per state.
[00:41:11.542 --> 00:41:13.363]  In the Ron Paul meetup groups and the rest of it.
[00:41:13.723 --> 00:41:18.764]  To not all just whine and scream and bellyache, we've got to move forward against the New World Order.
[00:41:19.244 --> 00:41:25.786]  Listen, we have had successes that we wouldn't have dreamed of 14 months ago before this campaign started, 13 and a half months ago.
[00:41:26.206 --> 00:41:37.450]  People are talking about the private Federal Reserve, they're talking about the North American Union, they're talking about the New World Order, they're talking about currency taxes, they're talking about how the two parties aren't different, and Ron Paul and you
[00:41:39.611 --> 00:41:41.633]  Using him as a focal point have done that.
[00:41:42.613 --> 00:41:45.755]  And we've got to support Ron Paul in retaining his congressional seat.
[00:41:47.116 --> 00:41:51.319]  Now, I don't particularly like the decision he's taken, but I fully understand it.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:58.444]  And then for face-saving, he put this spin on it that, don't worry, I'll keep putting our ideas out and I'll stay until the convention.
[00:41:59.064 --> 00:42:05.389]  So you don't totally flip out over your money being there and what it's going to be used for, he's going to use it to get the message out.
[00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.731]  And so he's doing that.
[00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:12.583]  He's out of the race, ladies and gentlemen, unless he runs third party.
[00:42:12.843 --> 00:42:19.147]  That's why at this time he said, look, there's not a prayer, a snowball's chance in Hades of a broker convention.
[00:42:19.167 --> 00:42:19.988]  That's reality.
[00:42:20.668 --> 00:42:23.510]  And he said, I'm not going to go third party because I'll lose my congressional seat.
[00:42:24.631 --> 00:42:25.111]  It's over.
[00:42:27.533 --> 00:42:29.114]  But it doesn't have to be over.
[00:42:29.134 --> 00:42:30.655]  I mean, what did you expect?
[00:42:30.675 --> 00:42:32.636]  We were just magically going to go fight him and win.
[00:42:32.696 --> 00:42:36.299]  I said we had a chance, but I said we're going to win by exposing election fraud.
[00:42:36.479 --> 00:42:38.000]  We're going to win by getting the word out.
[00:42:38.849 --> 00:42:40.510]  And using Ron Paul as a vehicle.
[00:42:41.011 --> 00:42:47.336]  It'd be a lot worse if we just laid down and let Hillary and McCain cinch it up and didn't expose that the systems are fraud.
[00:42:47.896 --> 00:42:49.818]  Okay, I've had my say on the Ron Paul thing.
[00:42:49.878 --> 00:42:50.859]  I want to go to your calls.
[00:42:51.279 --> 00:42:52.000]  Finish up, John.
[00:42:53.401 --> 00:42:53.621]  Right.
[00:42:53.961 --> 00:42:54.722]  Well, listen.
[00:42:55.303 --> 00:42:58.325]  The thing that matters the most is just simply the truth.
[00:42:58.505 --> 00:43:01.588]  Please don't anybody spin anything about Ron Paul.
[00:43:01.628 --> 00:43:02.568]  Don't you spin anything.
[00:43:02.609 --> 00:43:03.769]  Don't Ron Paul spin anything.
[00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.910]  We love you all.
[00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:05.971]  We love the truth movement.
[00:43:06.011 --> 00:43:06.792]  Let's pick it up.
[00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.431]  And I say let's do it the Jefferson way.
[00:43:10.486 --> 00:43:28.217]  Let's just, you know, what's going to win here is not politics, but the spirit of humanity, the spirit of love, the spirit of humanity, the true grit, Johnny Cash style, Dylan Lyrics, Jefferson style, you know what it is, I know what it is, that's what it's about, and that's the foundation.
[00:43:28.657 --> 00:43:36.202]  And the problem that I'm concerned about is once you lose sight of that foundation, that's the real truth movement, that's the real truth movement worldwide.
[00:43:36.562 --> 00:43:38.003]  Those who won't roll over,
[00:43:38.499 --> 00:43:40.481]  Those who will never say die.
[00:43:40.781 --> 00:43:42.302]  Those who will never give up.
[00:43:43.023 --> 00:43:46.406]  Those who will always eternally fight for freedom and liberty.
[00:43:46.426 --> 00:43:49.309]  That's a done deal with those who have the heart for that.
[00:43:49.489 --> 00:43:50.149]  I've got that.
[00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.291]  People around me have got that.
[00:43:52.912 --> 00:43:54.453]  We want Ron Paul to have that.
[00:43:55.074 --> 00:43:56.615]  We believe that you've got that.
[00:43:57.122 --> 00:43:58.223]  We want to move on that.
[00:43:58.363 --> 00:43:59.184]  That's the strength.
[00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:05.250]  The politics and the numbers is one thing, but it's about people staying in the race and being seen to stay in the race.
[00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:07.152]  It doesn't matter about winning.
[00:44:07.192 --> 00:44:12.577]  See John, I agree with you, but it sounded like earlier you were upset and then you say, please don't spin.
[00:44:12.857 --> 00:44:13.818]  We've spun nothing.
[00:44:13.878 --> 00:44:14.699]  I'm spinning nothing.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:15.520]  Yeah.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:19.364]  Well, that's what I'm trying to say is what I'm trying to say is that
[00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:25.074]  You know, it's like Ron Paul was put over to us as, well, we agreed.
[00:44:25.134 --> 00:44:25.994]  This is how we saw him.
[00:44:26.014 --> 00:44:28.096]  We see Ron Paul as talking Jefferson.
[00:44:28.756 --> 00:44:35.261]  And every now and then there's a glitch and we hear, you know, we hear a little bit of Gandhi and a little bit of appeasement and a little bit of something else.
[00:44:35.742 --> 00:44:38.744]  And then we think, no, no, we're all right, because Alex has got through grit.
[00:44:39.144 --> 00:44:40.105]  And that's how we perceive it.
[00:44:40.145 --> 00:44:43.627]  I'm just feeding back what's really going on in our psyche, Alex.
[00:44:43.687 --> 00:44:45.129]  I'm not looking at anything.
[00:44:45.389 --> 00:44:45.689]  I hear you.
[00:44:45.709 --> 00:44:46.109]  I got to move.
[00:44:46.129 --> 00:44:46.950]  I'm going to get to other people.
[00:44:48.749 --> 00:44:50.992]  John in New Jersey, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:44:51.012 --> 00:44:53.855]  Hey Alex, happy birthday, man.
[00:44:53.995 --> 00:44:54.376]  Thank you.
[00:44:54.436 --> 00:44:54.976]  What's on your mind?
[00:44:56.118 --> 00:44:58.060]  Oh, you got anything good planned for after the show?
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:58.861]  No, I don't.
[00:44:58.881 --> 00:45:00.643]  I'm going to be working just non-stop.
[00:45:01.404 --> 00:45:03.426]  You should take a break and go to a nice restaurant.
[00:45:03.446 --> 00:45:04.027]  You deserve it.
[00:45:04.067 --> 00:45:07.391]  Well, I do go out to eat some, but it's one of my few pleasures, but go ahead.
[00:45:08.468 --> 00:45:10.629]  Well, have a good birthday and try to enjoy yourself.
[00:45:10.649 --> 00:45:11.989]  You don't have to get too stressed out.
[00:45:12.449 --> 00:45:13.449]  Well, we better, sir.
[00:45:13.489 --> 00:45:17.190]  We have a criminal scientific elite poisoning us in the water supply.
[00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.231]  That's proven bare minimum.
[00:45:18.471 --> 00:45:21.851]  We're totally in just red-level crisis every minute of the day.
[00:45:22.812 --> 00:45:26.413]  And you can't reach out and... Listen, thanks for the call.
[00:45:26.433 --> 00:45:26.953]  I appreciate it.
[00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:31.314]  Okay, I appreciate you saying I should enjoy myself, but I don't want to make this about me, okay?
[00:45:32.234 --> 00:45:32.874]  Thank you, John.
[00:45:33.234 --> 00:45:34.435]  Thank you for the birthday thing.
[00:45:34.675 --> 00:45:35.395]  Who's up next here?
[00:45:37.469 --> 00:45:38.771]  Andrew in New York, go ahead.
[00:45:39.652 --> 00:45:40.072]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:40.793 --> 00:45:44.358]  Here in Central New York, you'd have never known that Congressman Ron Paul was running.
[00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:53.469]  Every time they print a picture or show it on the local television news, and anywhere in Central New York, Congressman Ron Paul would be suspiciously absent.
[00:45:54.833 --> 00:45:56.474]  Yeah, the local papers here did that.
[00:45:56.554 --> 00:46:02.676]  Every major paper in the country, every major TV show, 95% of the time wouldn't show him as a candidate.
[00:46:03.996 --> 00:46:06.297]  Even when he won first place, they wouldn't report on it.
[00:46:06.317 --> 00:46:09.098]  Or if he won second place, they would just lie and say McCain did.
[00:46:09.398 --> 00:46:10.239]  I mean, exactly!
[00:46:10.699 --> 00:46:12.920]  Look, it's not Ron Paul that did this to us.
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:13.760]  It's the system.
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:19.062]  You know, he went in there against a rigged game, and he gave it his best shot.
[00:46:20.543 --> 00:46:20.863]  He did.
[00:46:21.663 --> 00:46:22.843]  My thoughts exactly.
[00:46:22.863 --> 00:46:24.064]  There was one quick other thing?
[00:46:25.327 --> 00:46:31.170]  Did you happen to notice where they've got Spider-Man selling the UN to the kids in the schools now in a comic book they're going to put out?
[00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:32.951]  Yes, it's Marvel Comics.
[00:46:33.011 --> 00:46:33.751]  It never ends.
[00:46:34.351 --> 00:46:38.653]  How could Stan Lee ever get behind some crackpot group like that?
[00:46:38.713 --> 00:46:39.774]  I'll never understand.
[00:46:40.554 --> 00:46:41.735]  Isn't there anybody out there?
[00:46:42.235 --> 00:46:44.856]  You ever know how it's like the seven degrees of separation?
[00:46:44.896 --> 00:46:45.957]  Isn't there somebody out there?
[00:46:45.977 --> 00:46:48.438]  There's got to be somebody that knows somebody that knows him at least.
[00:46:49.048 --> 00:47:05.191]  Tell him, hey, you know, there's some people that have some serious concerns about, uh, putting all sorts of weird things into vaccines to make people sterile and kill them off, for instance, or inciting wars, either simple absence or presence, and things of that nature.
[00:47:05.451 --> 00:47:07.932]  The poor guy, I've heard him talk before.
[00:47:07.992 --> 00:47:10.933]  He does seem rather rational and sensible.
[00:47:10.953 --> 00:47:14.513]  I just don't understand how people like that could get sucked in.
[00:47:14.773 --> 00:47:17.274]  But I guess, you know, maybe it's the money.
[00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:20.996]  Maybe it's all just the money, I don't know, but I can certainly say this.
[00:47:22.297 --> 00:47:30.863]  In my 20-plus years as an independent investigative reporter, really quickly on another subject, I videotaped time and again getting myself pulled over.
[00:47:31.744 --> 00:47:37.788]  No way in God's green earth in New York State are you going to get Andrew Cuomo to ever investigate these problems, these issues.
[00:47:37.968 --> 00:47:39.949]  In Central New York, it's a common problem.
[00:47:40.329 --> 00:47:43.211]  We have parasites running our government and our society.
[00:47:43.231 --> 00:47:44.112]  I appreciate your call.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.501]  You notice when the U.N.
[00:47:46.541 --> 00:47:57.227]  announced that Marvel Comics is going to give free comic books to all children, and it said educating them about global government, but then if you tell the parents that there's a U.N.
[00:47:57.267 --> 00:48:00.729]  program to brainwash our children, they'll say it doesn't exist, there's no such thing.
[00:48:01.289 --> 00:48:07.673]  I mean, how do you get the general public to admit that there is conditioning and programming and influencing going on?
[00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:15.313]  I mean, I've got Time Magazine for kids, multiple issues telling the kids that they're all going to get microchips soon, and how great it's going to be.
[00:48:17.654 --> 00:48:22.115]  I mean, I've got newscasts and police training videos for kids from all over the country.
[00:48:22.195 --> 00:48:29.198]  One of them is in Road to Tyranny from 2002, where they give them $200 credit cards to turn their parents in, and they admit it!
[00:48:30.398 --> 00:48:35.080]  I mean, the government recruiting your children to go spy on you?
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.161]  The government is criminal!
[00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:42.593]  It's completely out of control!
[00:48:42.613 --> 00:48:49.480]  In Denver, the police pull you over and demand blood at random checkpoints to see if you're on drugs or alcohol.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.724]  Can you imagine the cops pull you over and try to stick a needle in your arm?
[00:48:55.086 --> 00:48:55.887]  I mean, it's over!
[00:48:57.669 --> 00:48:58.950]  That's as bad as it gets!
[00:49:00.051 --> 00:49:03.415]  Cameras reading all the license plates everywhere you go, your cell phones tracking you.
[00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:07.933]  Now they come to your door and knock and say, we want to search your house randomly for guns.
[00:49:07.973 --> 00:49:11.335]  I mean, you know, illegal guns, because guns are illegal in Boston.
[00:49:12.376 --> 00:49:15.078]  But in Dallas, they're not illegal, but they just want to come in and inspect.
[00:49:17.479 --> 00:49:18.380]  It's over, folks.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.701]  They built FEMA camps.
[00:49:19.881 --> 00:49:21.182]  They brainwashed the cops.
[00:49:22.139 --> 00:49:24.840]  The cops are drinking poison that's put in the water for them.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.741]  They're laughing right now in their squad cars.
[00:49:26.761 --> 00:49:27.241]  They love it!
[00:49:27.481 --> 00:49:28.641]  They love drinking poison!
[00:49:28.761 --> 00:49:29.942]  They love working for criminals!
[00:49:30.082 --> 00:49:30.782]  They love U.N.
[00:49:30.802 --> 00:49:31.502]  brainwashing!
[00:49:31.882 --> 00:49:34.363]  They think they're on the winning side and they're not on the winning side.
[00:49:36.964 --> 00:49:39.465]  So just go ahead and laugh and go drink a bunch of tap water.
[00:49:39.765 --> 00:49:47.048]  Just shoot your kids up, follow the mercury-filled shots, let them have convulsions, and just laugh at them and stick them in the corner in their diapers when they're ten years old.
[00:49:47.668 --> 00:49:48.068]  Fine!
[00:49:49.218 --> 00:49:50.479]  You think it's all real funny?
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.621]  I've done the research!
[00:49:51.681 --> 00:49:53.142]  I happen to know all this is real!
[00:49:53.422 --> 00:49:55.024]  I happen to know the New World Order is real!
[00:49:55.244 --> 00:49:58.027]  I happen to know that they've already killed hundreds of millions of people!
[00:49:59.048 --> 00:50:00.710]  I happen to know they're getting ready to do it here!
[00:50:05.382 --> 00:50:08.164]  And then all the black, hispanic, white infighting.
[00:50:08.204 --> 00:50:09.084]  None of it even matters.
[00:50:09.124 --> 00:50:14.568]  All this Republican, Democrat, all these stupid neocons in the message boards that make jokes about everything.
[00:50:14.608 --> 00:50:17.510]  And all this stuff's funny and, you know, torture's good.
[00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:18.571]  Ha ha ha!
[00:50:18.811 --> 00:50:20.952]  There's no police state and all this other bull.
[00:50:22.413 --> 00:50:24.514]  And all the dumb liberals supporting Hillary Clinton.
[00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:25.435]  It makes me sick!
[00:50:26.175 --> 00:50:27.696]  It makes me just want to throw up!
[00:50:28.817 --> 00:50:31.299]  It's so obvious, all the things that are going on.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.501]  And I just want to try to turn this around.
[00:50:39.198 --> 00:50:40.939]  I'm only going to have Napolitano on for 30 minutes.
[00:50:40.999 --> 00:50:43.940]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls.
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.061]  Your phone calls are after this break.
[00:50:51.283 --> 00:50:54.184]  I mean, we need to stop whining about Ron Paul and move forward.
[00:50:54.784 --> 00:50:55.424]  You understand?
[00:50:55.444 --> 00:50:59.266]  I know it was all fun and giggly and smiley face.
[00:50:59.326 --> 00:50:59.706]  It's not.
[00:51:02.154 --> 00:51:14.877]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:15.317 --> 00:51:22.039]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:51:22.419 --> 00:51:25.980]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.562]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:51:29.782 --> 00:51:31.482]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:51:31.522 --> 00:51:37.264]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:51.109]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism,
[00:51:51.749 --> 00:51:52.871]  And hundreds of other titles.
[00:51:53.292 --> 00:51:55.556]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[00:51:55.937 --> 00:52:01.248]  Truth is our weapon and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:52:02.402 --> 00:52:04.243]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:52:04.384 --> 00:52:09.567]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:52:09.727 --> 00:52:11.088]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:52:11.348 --> 00:52:19.514]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:52:19.754 --> 00:52:25.458]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:52:25.998 --> 00:52:26.238]  I think so.
[00:52:44.033 --> 00:52:44.373]  I think so.
[00:53:01.907 --> 00:53:07.548]  Now that we are in the midst of the presidential primaries, Republican candidate Ron Paul needs our support more than ever.
[00:53:07.948 --> 00:53:13.929]  Ron Paul stands for the issues that need to be addressed and not glossed over and forgotten like the globalist crowd being fielded.
[00:53:14.289 --> 00:53:20.611]  Unlike other candidates, Ron Paul takes a stand to follow what our forefathers envisioned America to be through the Constitution.
[00:53:20.911 --> 00:53:27.732]  Dr. Paul will restore sound money, eliminate the IRS, prevent the NAU, get us back to our constitutional roots.
[00:53:28.032 --> 00:53:28.592]  We're good to go.
[00:53:50.086 --> 00:53:54.487]  Go to RonPaulStickers.com and help get the word out about Ron Paul.
[00:53:54.827 --> 00:53:56.207]  This is our chance, America.
[00:53:56.467 --> 00:53:57.047]  Stand up.
[00:53:57.427 --> 00:54:06.889]  Now is the time to act.
[00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:14.450]  You know, a caller earlier brought up Marvel Comics.
[00:54:15.471 --> 00:54:17.911]  Admittedly, in a propaganda campaign for the UN,
[00:54:18.914 --> 00:54:20.955]  To condition children to accept world government.
[00:54:20.975 --> 00:54:22.315]  I mean, that's in a UN press release.
[00:54:22.916 --> 00:54:26.937]  You can't get the adults to even admit that there are propaganda campaigns.
[00:54:27.357 --> 00:54:29.038]  Nobody's propagandizing them.
[00:54:29.338 --> 00:54:30.939]  Nobody's got control of their mind.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.141]  Oh yeah, parents, why don't you just walk in a toy store now?
[00:54:36.681 --> 00:54:38.342]  It's been like this for at least 15 years.
[00:54:38.702 --> 00:54:41.543]  And you can't find toys that say USA on them.
[00:54:42.484 --> 00:54:43.364]  They're military toys.
[00:54:43.804 --> 00:54:44.244]  G.I.
[00:54:44.284 --> 00:54:45.525]  Joe or any of the other companies.
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:51.244]  Hundreds of different companies, all of it says UN Peacekeeper, World Peacekeeper.
[00:54:51.584 --> 00:54:56.308]  And the guys have evil looks on their faces and the kids put little toy black ski masks on them.
[00:54:58.009 --> 00:55:01.312]  Oh, there's no management, there's no propaganda pointed at our kids.
[00:55:01.852 --> 00:55:08.257]  All the major companies just magically don't have USA on the military toys anymore.
[00:55:10.199 --> 00:55:10.980]  That are sold here.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:16.424]  You've got that basic propaganda and there's literally millions of different types of propaganda.
[00:55:17.492 --> 00:55:23.097]  Every cartoon that I've seen trains the kids to thumb scan to buy and sell, to have checkpoints.
[00:55:25.039 --> 00:55:28.401]  Every show I see is about FEMA camps and people being put in camps.
[00:55:28.802 --> 00:55:32.705]  I mean, they're just, it's just, don't you understand who's running things?
[00:55:33.005 --> 00:55:36.468]  They're the people that put Lenin and Hitler in and Mao in.
[00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:39.230]  No, you don't understand.
[00:55:39.251 --> 00:55:40.832]  You're just going to have to live through it, aren't you?
[00:55:40.852 --> 00:55:42.093]  You're going to have to experience it.
[00:55:45.191 --> 00:55:46.211]  They're going for broke.
[00:55:46.251 --> 00:55:47.272]  They are in control.
[00:55:47.652 --> 00:55:49.272]  They manage and run the society.
[00:55:49.953 --> 00:55:54.794]  And so many of you, because you can't balance your checkbook, I'm the same way, you think, well there's nobody managing things.
[00:55:54.834 --> 00:55:56.555]  How do you think they put up those power poles?
[00:55:56.575 --> 00:55:58.596]  How do you think they lay out the grids of cities?
[00:55:58.816 --> 00:56:00.256]  Who do you think has social planning?
[00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:01.777]  Who do you think runs all this?
[00:56:02.157 --> 00:56:03.918]  Who do you think lays all these undersea cables?
[00:56:03.938 --> 00:56:05.778]  Who do you think puts the satellites in space?
[00:56:06.019 --> 00:56:07.679]  Or can shoot a cruise missile through a window?
[00:56:08.099 --> 00:56:12.801]  The same big brains, the same people that run the planet!
[00:56:13.795 --> 00:56:14.435]  The same ones.
[00:56:14.456 --> 00:56:17.978]  Why do you think all you women can't have kids and all you men are sterile now?
[00:56:20.439 --> 00:56:21.860]  You think all that happened by accident?
[00:56:22.081 --> 00:56:23.962]  I happen to have the official U.S.
[00:56:24.002 --> 00:56:25.123]  government documents!
[00:56:26.023 --> 00:56:27.544]  They're medicating all of us!
[00:56:27.744 --> 00:56:29.626]  They're poisoning the daylights out of us!
[00:56:30.846 --> 00:56:34.049]  Coming on here and acting normal almost helps them.
[00:56:35.169 --> 00:56:39.472]  Just even doing this show just almost makes it like it's like we're just talking about it.
[00:56:39.632 --> 00:56:41.594]  This is so bad we almost can't even talk about it.
[00:56:41.614 --> 00:56:42.154]  It's so bad.
[00:56:42.634 --> 00:56:43.595]  Action is what's needed.
[00:56:44.631 --> 00:56:46.691]  And I'm in one of the nastiest moods I've been in in years.
[00:56:51.772 --> 00:56:53.493]  Who's up next here, for heaven's sakes?
[00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:58.454]  Michael in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:56:59.494 --> 00:57:00.294]  Alex Jones!
[00:57:01.374 --> 00:57:04.175]  I'd like to say, brother, we commend you here in Illinois.
[00:57:04.335 --> 00:57:10.336]  It is also my birthday today, and for my birthday, I'm going down to Obama's headquarters at 5 o'clock.
[00:57:11.792 --> 00:57:13.653]  See, I'm so mad that I'm not even yelling.
[00:57:13.673 --> 00:57:14.693]  I'm just totally enraged.
[00:57:36.464 --> 00:57:38.845]  I went to a meeting last night, a Ron Paul meeting.
[00:57:39.805 --> 00:57:41.145]  It was off a meet-up.
[00:57:41.225 --> 00:57:42.045]  It was here in Illinois.
[00:57:42.065 --> 00:57:43.346]  I don't want to name the name of them.
[00:57:43.686 --> 00:57:47.626]  But we went in there and they're talking about how to redirect their energy into local government.
[00:57:47.686 --> 00:57:48.367]  Local government?
[00:57:48.387 --> 00:57:51.507]  We cannot infiltrate local Republican government.
[00:57:51.927 --> 00:57:53.268]  It's a moot point at this point.
[00:57:53.568 --> 00:57:59.849]  By the time we are able to move up within government and infiltrate it with our own people, we're a lost cause by then.
[00:58:00.169 --> 00:58:04.293]  We need to get up, we need to get outside, we need to start screaming at the top of our lungs.
[00:58:04.853 --> 00:58:10.498]  Aaron Russo's RestoreTheRepublic.com is still working on it.
[00:58:10.558 --> 00:58:11.599]  Become a member there.
[00:58:14.882 --> 00:58:16.703]  Your phone's breaking up, I appreciate your call.
[00:58:16.783 --> 00:58:18.725]  Listen, I disagree with you.
[00:58:18.785 --> 00:58:25.651]  We need to get into local government and we need to go out and confront politicians everywhere and break that illusion that everybody's buying into this.
[00:58:27.722 --> 00:58:29.784]  We need to get in the streets and we need to get into government.
[00:58:29.804 --> 00:58:34.349]  We need to do everything, attack at every level in the InfoWars.
[00:58:36.051 --> 00:58:39.094]  Speaking of the InfoWars, check out the redesigninfowars.com.
[00:58:39.114 --> 00:58:40.775]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.736 --> 00:58:45.560]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:48.804]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:58:58.861]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.521 --> 00:59:00.602]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.302 --> 00:59:02.403]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.064 --> 00:59:03.884]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.625 --> 00:59:05.545]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.186 --> 00:59:09.849]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.369 --> 00:59:14.432]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.712 --> 00:59:18.915]  Alright, we're breaking down where the Ron Paul campaign goes from here, where the presidential election goes.
[00:59:18.935 --> 00:59:20.436]  I have a stack of police state news.
[00:59:22.938 --> 00:59:24.619]  Got a big guest coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.041]  Chuck and Georgia, you're on the air.
[00:59:26.081 --> 00:59:26.461]  Go ahead.
[00:59:28.555 --> 00:59:30.416]  Hi, I got two points to make.
[00:59:30.536 --> 00:59:35.180]  One with Ron Paul, and two, I just want to ask you a question when I'm done, so don't cut me off, okay?
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:36.721]  Are you there?
[00:59:37.061 --> 00:59:38.362]  Yeah, I'm there, but, you know.
[00:59:38.382 --> 00:59:39.483]  Okay, great.
[00:59:39.863 --> 00:59:43.786]  First of all, Ron Paul has been running in Congress for ten years.
[00:59:43.966 --> 00:59:45.027]  The guy is a leader.
[00:59:45.427 --> 00:59:46.548]  He knows what he's doing.
[00:59:47.068 --> 00:59:48.629]  We've went to this bunker with him.
[00:59:48.709 --> 00:59:49.770]  We are in the battle.
[00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:51.071]  We are in the ground.
[00:59:51.151 --> 00:59:53.373]  We are looking out, and he is the head of the light.
[00:59:54.082 --> 00:59:58.165]  And I respect every decision he makes because he is the leader in what he does.
[00:59:58.546 --> 01:00:04.350]  So therefore I will say this to anyone who is coming against him and maybe, you know, criticizing his decisions.
[01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:05.772]  Shut up!
[01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:13.778]  You don't have time to play around with a man who has more integrity in his little pinky than most people got in their whole body.
[01:00:14.359 --> 01:00:21.805]  This guy laid down his life for his children, for his grandchildren, for his wife, for his family, and he is
[01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:23.551]  Proven to be a leader.
[01:00:23.631 --> 01:00:27.413]  So, therefore, get a backbone, not a wishbone, and shut up!
[01:00:28.093 --> 01:00:29.314]  That's my point on Ron Paul.
[01:00:29.674 --> 01:00:30.695]  I will stand by him.
[01:00:31.215 --> 01:00:32.335]  I think he has integrity.
[01:00:32.836 --> 01:00:33.856]  I think he has honesty.
[01:00:34.417 --> 01:00:37.958]  I see... I've never seen more character than... I mean, this guy has serious character.
[01:00:38.579 --> 01:00:40.120]  People need to understand.
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.740]  We must move on.
[01:00:41.981 --> 01:00:43.021]  Stay in the war.
[01:00:43.361 --> 01:00:44.242]  He is the general.
[01:00:44.502 --> 01:00:45.222]  He's in front.
[01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:46.143]  He's done it.
[01:00:46.223 --> 01:00:46.823]  He's proven it.
[01:00:46.883 --> 01:00:48.264]  He's doing it over and over again.
[01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.085]  And he's still working today.
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.241]  I have passion about this guy.
[01:00:52.642 --> 01:00:53.462]  I have conviction.
[01:00:53.742 --> 01:00:54.663]  I have excitement.
[01:00:54.883 --> 01:00:55.043]  Good.
[01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:55.904]  I hear your passion.
[01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.525]  Now, you had a question.
[01:00:57.905 --> 01:00:58.205]  Okay.
[01:00:58.246 --> 01:01:09.974]  The question was, did you see the video, let me see here, it's on the internet, from Ken, Ohio, of the lady that was strip-searched in the South?
[01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:10.554]  No.
[01:01:10.594 --> 01:01:12.736]  Everybody's been sending it to me and I've been so busy.
[01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:13.757]  I saw it.
[01:01:15.419 --> 01:01:17.101]  This is something I can't deal with anymore.
[01:01:17.381 --> 01:01:20.604]  People think I come in here and pick and choose things to make cops look bad.
[01:01:20.784 --> 01:01:22.205]  I can't watch it anymore.
[01:01:22.485 --> 01:01:23.546]  It's freaking me out.
[01:01:23.906 --> 01:01:25.027]  I'm getting enraged.
[01:01:25.308 --> 01:01:26.248]  I'm getting upset.
[01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:34.215]  I mean, I haven't watched it yet because for some reason I just can't watch some of this stuff now.
[01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:36.097]  Everybody keeps telling me about it.
[01:01:36.657 --> 01:01:38.279]  Watch the headline on the video and I'll watch it.
[01:01:39.002 --> 01:01:40.763]  Hey, first of all, I want to say this to you.
[01:01:41.144 --> 01:01:43.425]  It literally made me cry.
[01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:44.766]  I know, I can't watch this stuff.
[01:01:44.806 --> 01:01:48.409]  It's a strip search of a woman by a sheriff's deputies called Outrageous.
[01:01:48.469 --> 01:01:50.330]  And it's on, uh, well, you should be able to get it.
[01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:58.636]  And, uh, I gotta tell you, never in my life, and I see the conditioning here, I see the fear tactic here.
[01:01:59.497 --> 01:02:01.839]  I'm at a point where I don't know what to do.
[01:02:01.919 --> 01:02:06.302]  I'm literally ready to pack the car up, get over there and protest this thing because
[01:02:06.977 --> 01:02:19.005]  This is a blatant, in your face, this is a woman of our society, she bears fruit for our children, she nourishes our country, she brings forth a nation, and you take a woman and you do this to her?
[01:02:19.105 --> 01:02:21.046]  It is unbelievable!
[01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:23.559]  I suggest you watch it, my friend.
[01:02:23.679 --> 01:02:24.060]  I know.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:28.101]  Well, sir, I have stacks of similar things, and I just... I should watch it.
[01:02:28.521 --> 01:02:30.601]  Again, I don't take glee out of this.
[01:02:30.961 --> 01:02:36.963]  I have a stack of news here so horrible that I can't even make myself, most of the time, cover it on air.
[01:02:37.483 --> 01:02:41.724]  I mean, I'm getting to where I just... It's just... And I'm sad for these idiot police.
[01:02:42.204 --> 01:02:45.325]  They don't understand how they've been brainwashed, how they've been twisted.
[01:02:46.025 --> 01:02:46.966]  It's just so sick.
[01:02:47.126 --> 01:02:47.806]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:49.283 --> 01:02:53.425]  And you know, like that woman they killed at the airport, beating her to death and lying about it.
[01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:55.465]  Just all of it.
[01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:56.626]  What's the name of the video again?
[01:02:57.146 --> 01:03:03.328]  The name of the video is a strip search of a woman by sheriff's deputies called Outrageous and it's Canton, Ohio.
[01:03:04.228 --> 01:03:06.769]  Can you ask me, I'm going to ask you one question and I'll let you go.
[01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:08.850]  What do you do, Alex?
[01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:10.330]  How do you handle this?
[01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:13.011]  And if you watch the video during your next commercial break,
[01:03:13.447 --> 01:03:14.147]  Please address it.
[01:03:14.347 --> 01:03:15.808]  How do you handle something like this?
[01:03:16.128 --> 01:03:18.829]  I mean, unfortunately, you're a young guy.
[01:03:19.249 --> 01:03:20.390]  You came into this young.
[01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.811]  You had spit and vinegar.
[01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:23.911]  You've stepped into something that's big.
[01:03:24.372 --> 01:03:24.852]  You know it.
[01:03:25.352 --> 01:03:26.593]  You're in shock mode.
[01:03:27.013 --> 01:03:27.833]  Don't worry about it.
[01:03:27.873 --> 01:03:28.613]  We're in your corner.
[01:03:28.673 --> 01:03:29.714]  You are a beacon, man.
[01:03:30.334 --> 01:03:32.395]  Help people decide and learn what to do.
[01:03:32.435 --> 01:03:33.275]  I appreciate you, brother.
[01:03:33.295 --> 01:03:33.616]  Thank you.
[01:03:34.856 --> 01:03:35.296]  Oh, look.
[01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:36.277]  I'm committed to this.
[01:03:36.317 --> 01:03:37.917]  Just because I get bummed out sometimes.
[01:03:38.438 --> 01:03:38.618]  Look.
[01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:44.012]  They're so evil, sometimes I just can't even expose them anymore.
[01:03:44.032 --> 01:03:49.095]  I'm just like, my mouth's hanging open, and they're so surly and full of themselves and arrogant.
[01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:55.798]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:03:56.118 --> 01:03:59.600]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.621]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:04:01.961 --> 01:04:04.923]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:04:05.263 --> 01:04:08.985]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[01:04:08.985 --> 01:04:09.365]  We're good.
[01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:39.225]  We're good.

[01:07:01.826 --> 01:07:04.789]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:14.357 --> 01:07:18.438]  Well, this is his second time to join us, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:07:19.279 --> 01:07:23.901]  He's got a new book out, dealing with the attack on our liberties and freedoms.
[01:07:23.981 --> 01:07:25.221]  It's A Nation of Sheep.
[01:07:27.222 --> 01:07:31.964]  And he really doesn't need any introduction.
[01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:34.945]  He's known, he's a pundit on national television all over the place.
[01:07:35.891 --> 01:07:37.351]  We appreciate him coming on with us.
[01:07:38.052 --> 01:07:48.635]  Judge, I have articles in front of me about police at checkpoints, randomly taking people's DNA now, saying they're looking for serial killers, even though the serial killer could just move out of the area or it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:07:49.175 --> 01:07:57.238]  I have police doing knockin' talks, just saying, oh, we don't need a warrant, we just kinda ask if we can come in, but it turns out they're basically forcing their way in.
[01:07:57.298 --> 01:07:58.938]  Police set to search for guns at homes.
[01:07:59.378 --> 01:08:01.859]  Voluntary program is issue in community.
[01:08:02.359 --> 01:08:04.501]  Because these people are intimidated into letting them in.
[01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:07.102]  It's called knock and talk here in Texas.
[01:08:08.183 --> 01:08:11.245]  I mean, just the whole Bill of Rights, the whole country, it's just falling apart.
[01:08:11.706 --> 01:08:13.207]  And I guess you've written a book about that, haven't you?
[01:08:13.687 --> 01:08:29.198]  Well, I have, although the knock and talk is relatively new to me, and I'm shocked that it exists in Texas, of all places, because Texas is the only state in the Union that allows you to resist the police using deadly force.
[01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:30.779]  Now, you take the chance that you're right.
[01:08:31.571 --> 01:08:49.297]  If you're right, if the police don't have the right to be there, or if the police are arresting the wrong person, in most states you have to go along with them just because they're the police, bear the indignity and the cost of dealing with them, and ultimately they can't prove the case against you if you know they've arrested the wrong person.
[01:08:50.017 --> 01:08:52.898]  Somebody else with the name, for example, Alex Jones.
[01:08:53.339 --> 01:08:57.380]  In Texas, if you know that you are the wrong person,
[01:08:58.075 --> 01:09:01.222]  And if you know that they don't have the right to be there, you can shoot them.
[01:09:01.784 --> 01:09:03.407]  You can use deadly force against them.
[01:09:03.427 --> 01:09:05.793]  It's the only state in the Union that permits that, so I'm surprised.
[01:09:06.437 --> 01:09:08.298]  That the knock and talk is happening.
[01:09:08.518 --> 01:09:11.979]  Well, sir, they're not even saying you're a suspicious house.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:15.941]  In the suburbs of Dallas, they just come and knock and say, we want to search.
[01:09:16.281 --> 01:09:17.662]  And then they intimidate their way in.
[01:09:18.122 --> 01:09:30.127]  Well, I can understand the intimidation, because most people don't know what their rights are, which is why I've written three books telling people what their rights are, and why people like you provide a positive service for explaining what their rights are.
[01:09:30.147 --> 01:09:33.429]  But if the police don't have a warrant signed by a judge, you should simply close the door
[01:09:33.999 --> 01:09:35.100]  And wish them a nice day.
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:36.841]  You shouldn't have any conversation with them.
[01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.902]  They are not there to help you.
[01:09:39.783 --> 01:09:45.887]  Even Ronald Reagan used to say the nine most dangerous words in the English language are, I'm from the government, I'm here to help you.
[01:09:45.927 --> 01:09:47.928]  They are not there to help you.
[01:09:47.988 --> 01:09:54.012]  They are there to look for something which will intimidate or inculpate, is the actual word, you.
[01:09:54.132 --> 01:10:01.736]  And they should be fired and should be prosecuted for what they're doing because they're violating your civil liberties, which are guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.
[01:10:01.776 --> 01:10:02.537]  The Fourth Amendment
[01:10:03.393 --> 01:10:11.774]  Which the country has authorized federal agents to violate in the Patriot Act and various other legislation, all of which is unconstitutional.
[01:10:11.814 --> 01:10:19.256]  Nevertheless, the Fourth Amendment says only judges can sign search warrants, and the government can't come on your property without a search warrant.
[01:10:19.276 --> 01:10:19.996]  It's pretty basic.
[01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:20.976]  It's pretty simple stuff.
[01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:23.096]  It's been violated all the time.
[01:10:23.396 --> 01:10:28.517]  You were the youngest life-tenured Superior Court judge in history in the state of New Jersey.
[01:10:29.778 --> 01:10:31.838]  You are a national television analyst.
[01:10:32.598 --> 01:10:36.320]  You've also published the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, LA Times, the list goes on and on.
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:46.324]  I mean, I can read the Bill of Rights, I know what it says, but what do you do at a checkpoint when the police now say, this is going on by the way in suburbs of Denver, in the Denver Post, they act like it's good.
[01:10:47.108 --> 01:10:50.930]  The paper reports it, and they now take blood samples looking for drug use.
[01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:54.331]  What do I do when the police pull me over and say, get out, we're going to take your blood?
[01:10:54.692 --> 01:10:57.013]  There's a bunch of cars lined up and they're sucking my blood.
[01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.054]  I mean, this is worse than Nazi Germany.
[01:10:59.294 --> 01:11:00.094]  Show me your papers.
[01:11:00.154 --> 01:11:02.715]  It's now, give me a cheek swab, give me some blood.
[01:11:04.056 --> 01:11:04.916]  We're just going to do this.
[01:11:05.296 --> 01:11:06.257]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:08.018]  It is worse than Nazi Germany.
[01:11:08.078 --> 01:11:12.980]  Even the Nazis, maybe they didn't have the technology, didn't think of this one.
[01:11:13.624 --> 01:11:22.968]  I mean, you really need to resist it in a loud and obvious way so that no one there can say that you consented.
[01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:26.630]  But now if you ask a question of police, they taser you.
[01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:29.832]  They say asking a question now is a taser-able.
[01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:33.153]  The police now taser you to give urine samples, I mean, torture.
[01:11:33.173 --> 01:11:39.576]  I agree with you that the police do that because we're getting closer and closer to a police state.
[01:11:40.076 --> 01:11:40.957]  One of the reasons
[01:11:41.573 --> 01:11:49.976]  That states have allowed police to do this is because of what the feds, from and after the Patriot Act, have allowed FBI agents to do.
[01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:51.696]  It's sort of a copycat.
[01:11:52.097 --> 01:12:01.720]  I mean, if the CIA can torture people that we believe are terrorists, why can't the New York Police Department torture people that we believe, for example, are pedophiles?
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.461]  If they're pedophiles, they don't have any rights.
[01:12:03.801 --> 01:12:04.721]  That's the argument.
[01:12:05.253 --> 01:12:11.497]  That would be made, and it's a natural argument that naturally follows from what the federal government does to people.
[01:12:11.557 --> 01:12:14.920]  The state and local governments are assumed to follow.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:20.143]  Did you know that a lot of law enforcement publications, even pre-9-11, were advocating torture as a good thing?
[01:12:20.644 --> 01:12:21.964]  No, I did not know that.
[01:12:23.365 --> 01:12:24.886]  But I'm not surprised by it.
[01:12:25.367 --> 01:12:32.732]  You know, I'm one of those people that went on the bench as the child, if you will,
[01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:47.812]  of powerful law and order forces in the state of New Jersey and after about six or seven months on the bench found myself a strong constitutionalist, a strong supporter of the Bill of Rights
[01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:50.306]  And a classic libertarian, if you will.
[01:12:50.346 --> 01:12:58.389]  It got to the point where the things I saw, and I told all this in my first book, called Constitutional Chaos, what happens when the government breaks its own laws.
[01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:15.517]  The things that I saw from the bench, literally from the bench in the courtroom, that the police and the government did, were so outrageous that I rejected the basic principle of law, which is that the government's behavior is presumed lawful and is presumed constitutional.
[01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:20.856]  And it's the defendant's burden to prove it unlawful or unconstitutional.
[01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:23.960]  In my courtroom, that presumption was switched.
[01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:29.648]  It's the government's burden to prove that its behavior is lawful and constitutional.
[01:13:30.951 --> 01:13:32.072]  How did it get like this?
[01:13:32.132 --> 01:13:35.033]  And I want to briefly talk about your new book, which I've read a part of.
[01:13:35.073 --> 01:13:36.094]  It's excellent.
[01:13:36.134 --> 01:13:38.555]  I mean, obviously there's organizing forces.
[01:13:38.595 --> 01:13:40.616]  The feds are teaching the states to act like this.
[01:13:40.956 --> 01:13:41.817]  It's getting crazier.
[01:13:41.837 --> 01:13:46.660]  I mean, cameras in school bathrooms in hundreds of districts I know of, watching them go potty.
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.761]  I mean, this is worse than 1984.
[01:13:49.141 --> 01:13:51.242]  Just, just, just pell-mell insanity.
[01:13:51.982 --> 01:13:54.524]  It's gotten like this because the neocons
[01:13:55.698 --> 01:14:04.347]  Have persuaded vast majority of segments of the country, the media included, that if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.
[01:14:05.167 --> 01:14:08.931]  So whenever I get in an argument like this and somebody looks at me and says, what do you have to hide?
[01:14:08.971 --> 01:14:10.052]  And I say, everything.
[01:14:10.553 --> 01:14:11.774]  I have my dignity to hide.
[01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:13.275]  I have my personality to hide.
[01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:14.857]  I have my privacy to hide.
[01:14:15.478 --> 01:14:17.578]  You want me to entrust those things to the government?
[01:14:17.618 --> 01:14:25.160]  Let's see, the government can't deliver the mail, it can't fill potholes, it doesn't know who's paid taxes and who hasn't, it can't secure the borders.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:32.581]  Why would you trust a government that can't do the basic things we hire it for with personal, private information about you?
[01:14:33.341 --> 01:14:38.663]  Ultimately, after the right to live, the greatest of rights is the right to be left alone.
[01:14:39.143 --> 01:14:41.043]  That's why we have a Fourth Amendment!
[01:14:41.511 --> 01:14:45.953]  So that when it is honored, the government will be forced to leave us alone.
[01:14:46.033 --> 01:14:49.855]  Well, Judge Napolitano, it's clear we've got to get you up for a full hour sometime in the near future.
[01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:55.277]  I know you're very busy with your own syndicated radio show and TV appearances and writing and the rest of it, but I mean, here's the deal.
[01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:56.378]  I'm getting really freaked out.
[01:14:57.298 --> 01:15:00.080]  I mean, I have footage every day that I don't even play on air.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.661]  It's like I'm overwhelmed with it.
[01:15:02.962 --> 01:15:09.826]  Where a lady just argues lightly and the cop tasers her and then charges her with assaulting him when she didn't touch him.
[01:15:10.086 --> 01:15:12.747]  I mean, false charges now are just normal.
[01:15:13.147 --> 01:15:17.270]  I don't know how these people sleep at night falsely charging people.
[01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:21.032]  I mean, it's getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
[01:15:21.072 --> 01:15:30.256]  Well, what you have to do is you need some sort of a recording device in your car to back up your words, and you need to sue the government aggressively.
[01:15:30.716 --> 01:15:49.744]  And even if, because of certain sovereign immunity statutes, some states that make it almost impossible to sue the government, if you can at least get into the media pictures or sound descriptions of what the police did, ultimately they're going to have to back down, or some of these cops are going to lose their jobs, or the people will rise up against them.
[01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:54.386]  I mean, it's the reason we have a Second Amendment, is not to protect hunters!
[01:15:55.129 --> 01:16:00.391]  It's to allow us to keep our freedom if the government becomes subject to tyrants.
[01:16:00.531 --> 01:16:01.712]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[01:16:01.852 --> 01:16:06.974]  Bush has put in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act that all of this is for insurrection.
[01:16:06.994 --> 01:16:11.636]  I have video of police training nationwide with military saying they're getting ready for martial law.
[01:16:11.996 --> 01:16:13.537]  I think they're trying to push us.
[01:16:13.837 --> 01:16:15.217]  I don't think the average cop knows this.
[01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:16.298]  A lot of cops are good people.
[01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:20.800]  But the direction, the organization of all of this
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:36.184]  I think it's coming towards a confrontation, because I know people who are mild-mannered business owners, and they say they're getting to where they can't take it, and there's almost a craziness, and I'm feeling it now in the population, where we're just, it's just, we can't take it, man!
[01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:37.384]  We can't take it anymore!
[01:16:38.465 --> 01:16:51.008]  Well, people like you have exposed this stuff, and as more and more people listen to you, more and more of these excesses will be exposed, but like all wars,
[01:16:51.829 --> 01:16:55.413]  People will lose their lives and their freedom and their dignity before the war is won.
[01:16:55.873 --> 01:16:57.535]  But that's not a reason for not fighting it.
[01:16:57.635 --> 01:16:58.736]  You have to keep fighting it.
[01:16:59.256 --> 01:17:03.841]  Because we are individuals, free individuals, who choose the government.
[01:17:04.241 --> 01:17:06.183]  And we can't choose a government that destroys us.
[01:17:06.932 --> 01:17:13.016]  Well, then they also give illegal aliens a pass on no driver's license, they're allowed to DWI, drink, that's admitted.
[01:17:13.456 --> 01:17:19.760]  The cops all over admit they're told to leave them alone, but then they'll throw the book at some old lady and beat up a 90-year-old blind woman.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.301]  I mean, I got that on tape.
[01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:22.481]  I can't handle it, Judge!
[01:17:22.501 --> 01:17:25.343]  Yeah, well, we're going to have a classic confrontation this fall.
[01:17:26.044 --> 01:17:41.769]  Between John McCain, who wants us to fight a foreign war for the next hundred years, but does not want illegals to get driver's licenses, and Barack Obama, who wants us to stop fighting illegal wars immediately, but wants to give illegals driver's licenses, the American public are going to have to make a choice.
[01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:47.911]  And it's not going to be an easy choice to make, because good's going to come with either of them, and bad's going to come with both of them.
[01:17:48.071 --> 01:17:49.992]  Why do you call it a nation of sheep?
[01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:55.654]  Because when we allow the government to do these things, we are as sheep.
[01:17:56.232 --> 01:18:02.195]  Just looking for a strong person to lead us into safety, but a loss of our freedoms.
[01:18:02.795 --> 01:18:17.541]  And we've elected a Congress which has enacted legislation which permits FBI agents to do to and for us the very things that, when done to and for us by the British government when we were colonists, caused us to fight a revolution.
[01:18:17.941 --> 01:18:22.043]  When British soldiers were allowed to write their own search warrants, it was the last straw
[01:18:22.737 --> 01:18:34.321]  And it brought about July 4th, 1776, but yet American FBI agents can write their search warrants till the cows come home, and the sheep will say, just keep me safe.
[01:18:35.661 --> 01:18:37.682]  A Nation of Sheep, it's already a bestseller.
[01:18:39.082 --> 01:18:41.543]  JudgeKnapp.com, thank you for spending time with us.
[01:18:41.823 --> 01:18:43.184]  My pleasure, Alex, any day.
[01:18:43.224 --> 01:18:44.004]  Keep up the good work.
[01:18:44.124 --> 01:18:44.464]  You too.
[01:18:44.484 --> 01:18:49.826]  Alright, we'll be right back with your calls, and we do have the strip search, I did watch it, and I just can't handle it.
[01:18:54.477 --> 01:18:55.878]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:58.020]  A new world order.
[01:18:58.721 --> 01:19:03.125]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:19:03.605 --> 01:19:05.767]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:19:06.447 --> 01:19:08.709]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:11.632]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:12.413 --> 01:19:19.921]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.764 --> 01:19:27.730]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:28.210 --> 01:19:31.673]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:32.073 --> 01:19:34.595]  Bill Burgess is making great progress for the world government.
[01:19:34.635 --> 01:19:35.776]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.796 --> 01:19:36.577]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.597 --> 01:19:37.638]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.858 --> 01:19:38.619]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.839 --> 01:19:39.980]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:56.631]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:19:56.811 --> 01:20:01.975]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:20:02.335 --> 01:20:07.659]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:20:08.059 --> 01:20:09.160]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:20:09.521 --> 01:20:18.407]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:20.448]  Now compare a cowbend pure soap.
[01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:24.852]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:58.557]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:21:58.998 --> 01:22:03.220]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:22:03.661 --> 01:22:10.505]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:10.945 --> 01:22:17.652]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:17.973 --> 01:22:19.595]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:22:19.875 --> 01:22:23.078]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:22:23.339 --> 01:22:25.801]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[01:22:40.052 --> 01:22:42.232]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:22:58.175 --> 01:23:05.677]  Alright, we're going to play the audio of this woman screaming and yelling as they brutalize her and rip her clothes off male guards.
[01:23:07.117 --> 01:23:08.457]  It's all part of the freedom.
[01:23:10.658 --> 01:23:13.718]  Middle-aged, blonde-haired housewife who called the cops for help.
[01:23:17.019 --> 01:23:19.299]  And again, I take no pleasure bashing the police.
[01:23:19.459 --> 01:23:25.000]  I'm... I'm just... I am just so hurt by everything that's happened, what our culture's turned into.
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:26.881]  The public acts like a bunch of animals, too.
[01:23:26.941 --> 01:23:27.821]  It's not just the police.
[01:23:29.631 --> 01:23:32.532]  And I hate bad guys winning.
[01:23:32.673 --> 01:23:35.334]  I hate evil getting away with it time and time again.
[01:23:35.434 --> 01:23:38.555]  I'm tired of the New World Order winning and winning and winning and winning.
[01:23:38.996 --> 01:23:40.456]  And this is only the beginning, you see.
[01:23:40.856 --> 01:23:41.517]  I'm upset.
[01:23:41.637 --> 01:23:42.497]  I am horrified.
[01:23:42.957 --> 01:23:44.618]  I can't think about anything.
[01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:53.943]  When anything good happens in my life, or I look at how innocent and pure and good my children are, I just think about how wicked and stinking and just disgusting the New World Order is.
[01:23:55.103 --> 01:23:58.805]  And then, you know, some freak nut goes on my MySpace account and says,
[01:23:59.651 --> 01:24:02.572]  You know, you're an evil white man.
[01:24:02.632 --> 01:24:03.693]  We're going to get you.
[01:24:03.713 --> 01:24:06.374]  You know, we're the real prophets.
[01:24:06.934 --> 01:24:07.514]  You're not.
[01:24:08.514 --> 01:24:09.535]  I'm not a prophet!
[01:24:10.315 --> 01:24:17.118]  And I'm sick of all these nutcases who think that black people are God, or white people are God, or all of this stuff's going on.
[01:24:17.758 --> 01:24:18.698]  I'm just tired of it!
[01:24:19.518 --> 01:24:20.739]  I'm tired of all of it!
[01:24:21.494 --> 01:24:48.694]  I'm tired of all the scum patriot groups that do nothing but fight with each other, and I'm tired of all the dumb yuppies, and I'm tired of all the dumb corrupt cops, and I'm tired of all the speed traps and the CPS grabbing people's kids, and I'm just sick of all the fraudulent wars, and nothing makes me sicker than all these neocons on message boards and all the juvenile humor, and to know that half of them are sent comp, paid by the government to go on there and do it.
[01:24:49.921 --> 01:24:51.503]  You know, none of this is a laughing matter.
[01:24:52.824 --> 01:24:53.485]  None of it is.
[01:24:54.766 --> 01:24:57.329]  Let's just play part of this newscast.
[01:24:57.349 --> 01:24:58.410]  I'm going to come back and comment on it.
[01:24:58.430 --> 01:25:00.813]  We're going to take calls the rest of the show, and I've got a bunch of other news, too.
[01:25:01.253 --> 01:25:02.415]  But I am just outraged.
[01:25:02.435 --> 01:25:03.296]  And it's good to be outraged.
[01:25:03.316 --> 01:25:04.337]  That's how we're going to change things.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.523]  The system is just pushing and pushing and pushing.
[01:25:08.563 --> 01:25:09.564]  You think things are bad now?
[01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:13.088]  They're putting a total control grid in, where you don't do everything they say.
[01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:14.670]  They just turn your national ID card off.
[01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:15.651]  You can't have a job.
[01:25:15.671 --> 01:25:16.652]  You can't buy or sell.
[01:25:17.033 --> 01:25:18.394]  They're building prisons everywhere.
[01:25:18.634 --> 01:25:19.716]  This is the new America.
[01:25:19.936 --> 01:25:21.097]  This is what we're going into.
[01:25:21.157 --> 01:25:21.498]  Here it is.
[01:25:22.239 --> 01:25:26.661]  This next story is one that is hard to tell, and the video is hard to watch.
[01:25:27.001 --> 01:25:31.963]  But the victim feels it's important that you know what happened to her inside a local jail.
[01:25:32.143 --> 01:25:35.965]  Channel 3 News is the only station in town who has this disturbing video.
[01:25:36.025 --> 01:25:45.389]  Now, the investigator, Tom Meyer, joins us with an exclusive Channel 3 News investigation on what's being called an outrageous strip search of a Stark County woman.
[01:25:45.589 --> 01:25:45.809]  Tom?
[01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:49.731]  Well, Hope Stuffy has sued the Stark County Sheriff, accusing deputies
[01:25:50.291 --> 01:25:52.253]  of using excessive and brutal force.
[01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:53.714]  The sheriff denies the allegation.
[01:25:54.274 --> 01:26:03.800]  Now this story may be hard to watch but the victim and her husband want me to show you what happened in hopes that you and those you love will never experience a night like this.
[01:26:11.832 --> 01:26:13.594]  Hope Steffi is scared to death.
[01:26:13.874 --> 01:26:24.442]  Her husband, a high school educator, I want to show you this, okay, can't believe what he's watching on videotape as Stark County Sheriff deputies pin his wife down to a jail cell floor.
[01:26:25.043 --> 01:26:30.247]  You don't treat people like this.
[01:26:36.221 --> 01:26:38.843]  I don't think murderers are treated like this.
[01:26:39.403 --> 01:26:41.465]  Steffi weighs 125 pounds.
[01:26:41.765 --> 01:26:43.806]  She's in handcuffs, face down.
[01:26:44.186 --> 01:26:49.370]  Yet her lawyers say up to seven individuals working for the sheriff or jail are in the cell.
[01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:54.213]  Both women and men deputies forcibly remove all her clothes.
[01:26:54.293 --> 01:26:57.075]  What are you doing?
[01:26:57.576 --> 01:27:00.838]  Two males holding her down as she's butt naked.
[01:27:02.429 --> 01:27:03.250]  That's wrong.
[01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:14.706]  The video, obtained exclusively by Channel 3 News, gives us a rare inside look at what can happen to you or a loved one, even if you're the one who calls police for help.
[01:27:15.346 --> 01:27:16.007]  What is she saying?
[01:27:16.027 --> 01:27:20.033]  She says she felt like she was raped without penetration.
[01:27:24.235 --> 01:27:26.117]  Back to this disturbing video in a moment.
[01:27:26.357 --> 01:27:29.120]  First, how did Steffi wind up in the Sheriff's custody?
[01:27:29.581 --> 01:27:32.664]  Amazingly, it started with a 911 call for help.
[01:27:33.745 --> 01:27:34.486]  Who's crying?
[01:27:35.067 --> 01:27:37.049]  Um, the girl that got attacked, my second cousin.
[01:27:37.469 --> 01:27:37.990]  Okay, what?
[01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:39.271]  Is she hurt?
[01:27:40.072 --> 01:27:44.637]  Um, she has a cut on her nose, she's bleeding, and there's a patch of hair on the ground beside the car.
[01:27:45.852 --> 01:27:48.294]  A deputy responds to a report of an assault.
[01:27:48.554 --> 01:27:52.456]  Hope Steffi is identified as the victim, the one who needed help.
[01:27:52.817 --> 01:27:55.298]  But when help arrives, things get even worse.
[01:27:56.139 --> 01:27:58.100]  Hope was not treated as the victim.
[01:27:58.775 --> 01:28:00.477]  The situation gets complicated.
[01:28:00.657 --> 01:28:04.260]  Steffi says she accidentally turned over the wrong Grimer's license.
[01:28:04.721 --> 01:28:06.923]  It belonged to her sister who passed away.
[01:28:07.463 --> 01:28:09.665]  Steffi keeps it as a personal memento.
[01:28:10.106 --> 01:28:14.250]  Despite her pleas to return it, her lawyer says the officer refuses.
[01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:18.294]  The officer had said to her, shut up about your dead sister.
[01:28:19.221 --> 01:28:23.023]  The Sheriff denied that allegation in a written response to Steffi's lawsuit.
[01:28:23.523 --> 01:28:27.625]  He accuses the injured Steffi of starting the altercation with a deputy.
[01:28:28.206 --> 01:28:31.187]  Soon, Steffi is put under- We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:32.528 --> 01:28:33.388]  This is nothing.
[01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:37.650]  I have a stack of news with them raping women in these jails.
[01:28:44.073 --> 01:28:44.994]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.474 --> 01:28:46.975]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:50.674]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.364 --> 01:28:58.625]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:28:58.885 --> 01:29:03.766]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:29:03.986 --> 01:29:05.307]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:05.487 --> 01:29:08.987]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:29:53.939 --> 01:29:58.881]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[01:29:59.201 --> 01:30:01.061]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[01:30:01.261 --> 01:30:04.322]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:30:04.502 --> 01:30:07.623]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:30:07.943 --> 01:30:09.684]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:30:09.684 --> 01:30:10.184]  We're good to go.
[01:30:33.251 --> 01:30:33.491]  We're good.
[01:30:54.216 --> 01:30:55.857]  American needs Ron Paul.
[01:30:55.977 --> 01:30:59.400]  There are numerous ways to show your support for him, and a better America.
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:03.502]  We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger scale.
[01:31:03.662 --> 01:31:06.604]  That's why we have created RonPaulFlags.com.
[01:31:06.764 --> 01:31:14.710]  RonPaulFlags.com produces some of the most beautiful flags dedicated to electing the only man fit to be president of our ailing country.
[01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:20.794]  Standard flags are 3 feet by 5 feet, and custom flags can be as large as 30 feet by 50 feet.
[01:31:20.974 --> 01:31:24.036]  Our most popular flags are Ron Paul, president in Ohio.
[01:31:24.036 --> 01:31:24.736]  We're good to go!
[01:32:18.775 --> 01:32:40.065]  Livin' on the road, my friend Was gonna keep you free and clean And now you wear your skin like iron And your breath as hard as kerosene Weren't your mama's only boy But her favorite one, it seems
[01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:48.515]  She began to cry when you said goodbye.
[01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:51.577]  He sank into your dream.
[01:32:51.878 --> 01:32:55.801]  Hunter was a bandit boy.
[01:32:55.901 --> 01:32:59.604]  His horse was fast as all his steel.
[01:32:59.644 --> 01:33:02.246]  He wore his gun outside his pants.
[01:33:07.362 --> 01:33:14.827]  You know, music like this is one of the few things that still brings joy to my life.
[01:33:14.907 --> 01:33:15.287]  And this...
[01:33:38.137 --> 01:33:39.957]  A little piece that Merle Haggard does.
[01:33:40.277 --> 01:33:44.998]  He's got to have one of the most beautiful voices ever.
[01:33:48.419 --> 01:33:52.500]  Coming up here in a minute with Willie and then I'm going to get back into this horrible audio and take your calls.
[01:34:04.443 --> 01:34:24.632]  He ended up and left his mouth The day they laid poor Pancho low Left his foot for Ohio Where he got the bread to go There ain't nobody to know
[01:34:36.624 --> 01:34:45.454]  We only let him slip away out of hindsight's scope.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:30.033]  Poets tell how Fonjo fell And left his living in a cheap hotel The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold So the story ends, we're told
[01:35:31.278 --> 01:35:37.722]  I don't need your prayers this noon to say that Hugh left it too.
[01:35:38.823 --> 01:35:41.864]  He only did what he had to do.
[01:35:45.586 --> 01:35:47.488]  And now he's grown old.
[01:35:56.075 --> 01:35:58.296]  We could have had him any day.
[01:35:58.516 --> 01:36:02.819]  We only let him go so long.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:07.281]  Out of my size.
[01:36:07.621 --> 01:36:15.145]  A few great men are all the same.
[01:36:15.845 --> 01:36:18.706]  We could have had him any day.
[01:36:19.467 --> 01:36:21.948]  We only let him go so long.
[01:36:25.906 --> 01:36:30.949]  Alright, let's get back to the nightmare.
[01:36:32.309 --> 01:36:35.211]  Because if we don't talk about this, people aren't going to learn, they're not going to find out.
[01:36:35.231 --> 01:36:42.514]  I have a stack of news here with guards and police all over the country raping women in the jail cells.
[01:36:43.355 --> 01:36:52.579]  Right here in Austin, they shut down the women's prison, who was running that at the time, Wacken Hut, because they were raping, reportedly, all the women and videotaping it.
[01:36:54.370 --> 01:36:55.691]  I have this report here.
[01:36:55.891 --> 01:36:59.534]  How well did Florida governor know alleged child porn peddler?
[01:36:59.974 --> 01:37:08.721]  Floridians were shocked last week when police announced that the spokesman for the state's Department of Children and Families had been arrested and charged with peddling child pornography.
[01:37:09.421 --> 01:37:12.784]  But buried in the news accounts of the case was a curious detail.
[01:37:13.024 --> 01:37:19.909]  The official in question had listed the state's current Republican governor, Charlie Crist, as a reference when he applied for the Post in 2005.
[01:37:20.009 --> 01:37:21.831]  Now let's just stop right there.
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:35.224]  If you have a memory, you would remember that in 2002 and 2003, it was reported by national news, CNN only a few times, and quite a big story in Florida.
[01:37:35.244 --> 01:37:40.546]  The 3,500 plus children that CPS had taken were gone.
[01:37:42.247 --> 01:37:46.628]  They found a couple of them dead with their heads chopped off in other states.
[01:37:46.748 --> 01:37:47.369]  I'm not kidding.
[01:37:47.389 --> 01:37:48.509]  Go Google it and pull it up.
[01:37:49.503 --> 01:37:50.684]  Others were found in Europe.
[01:37:50.964 --> 01:37:52.505]  Others were found in Saudi Arabia.
[01:37:52.665 --> 01:37:54.526]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[01:37:56.167 --> 01:37:57.508]  I just can't do it anymore.
[01:37:57.588 --> 01:37:58.688]  I just can't deal with it.
[01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:02.731]  A huge industrial ring.
[01:38:03.831 --> 01:38:08.914]  And then it came out that the top three running CPS in Florida were convicted child rapists.
[01:38:09.935 --> 01:38:13.377]  And I don't mean some pervert going after 15 or 16 year olds.
[01:38:13.397 --> 01:38:14.117]  That's bad enough.
[01:38:14.257 --> 01:38:15.358]  I mean little babies.
[01:38:16.639 --> 01:38:18.540]  Who do you think runs this stuff?
[01:38:21.073 --> 01:38:27.256]  Now, that got hushed up and we never heard again where the thousands of missing... These are children they took who were gone.
[01:38:27.556 --> 01:38:28.816]  I mean, thousands of them!
[01:38:30.777 --> 01:38:34.699]  And it only got in the news because they kept finding them dead in other countries and states.
[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:45.783]  So see, when I see something like this, and I see this stuff all the time out of Florida, every month, the whole thing is run... Florida is pure evil.
[01:38:46.363 --> 01:38:48.404]  Now, why are they getting caught?
[01:38:48.444 --> 01:38:50.745]  Because the whole government itself isn't evil yet.
[01:38:51.235 --> 01:38:52.897]  The whole CPS system in Florida is.
[01:38:53.137 --> 01:38:54.738]  It hadn't gone bad everywhere.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.143]  But this is like exponential development, just like a virus.
[01:38:59.183 --> 01:39:03.907]  You get one virus, it plugs into your tissue, it programs the cell to produce a thousand.
[01:39:04.187 --> 01:39:06.610]  The cell busts open, a thousand viruses go.
[01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:12.015]  Now, they program a thousand cells to make a thousand viruses.
[01:39:14.199 --> 01:39:16.560]  Now we're dealing with hundreds of thousands of viruses.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.620]  Then they go program hundreds of thousands of cells.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.861]  You get millions of viruses.
[01:39:23.181 --> 01:39:26.202]  They're at the fourth or fifth replication point.
[01:39:26.362 --> 01:39:28.682]  They've got most of the slots filled with crooks.
[01:39:28.962 --> 01:39:29.923]  Some of them like money.
[01:39:30.123 --> 01:39:31.523]  Some of them like raping kids.
[01:39:31.783 --> 01:39:34.664]  Some of them just like being psychopathic killers.
[01:39:34.924 --> 01:39:36.264]  They're kicking the good cops out.
[01:39:36.464 --> 01:39:37.984]  They're kicking the good mayors out.
[01:39:38.164 --> 01:39:39.705]  They're getting their people everywhere.
[01:39:39.765 --> 01:39:40.685]  It's called tyranny.
[01:39:42.017 --> 01:39:52.080]  And they're being directed by a scientific technocracy that has spent billions of dollars studying how our minds work, how to manipulate us, how to condition us, how to dumb us down.
[01:39:52.801 --> 01:39:55.602]  They're poisoned in the water, the food, the air.
[01:39:55.822 --> 01:39:59.543]  They got their little demons running everything at the ground level that don't know what's going on.
[01:39:59.763 --> 01:40:00.863]  They'll just follow orders.
[01:40:01.684 --> 01:40:08.326]  Now the military, for at least eight years, has been hiring hardcore, aggravated felons and giving them pardons.
[01:40:09.602 --> 01:40:10.703]  Administrative pardons.
[01:40:10.963 --> 01:40:12.104]  They're just wiping their records.
[01:40:12.184 --> 01:40:14.467]  No judge, no jury, no governor.
[01:40:16.869 --> 01:40:17.750]  It's all happening.
[01:40:19.331 --> 01:40:24.396]  Now they're hiring illegal aliens for at least eight years, who also happen to be aggravated felons.
[01:40:24.456 --> 01:40:27.659]  That's who that you can't make this up!
[01:40:27.919 --> 01:40:29.020]  They're everywhere!
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:31.282]  They're getting ready to move en masse on us!
[01:40:34.645 --> 01:40:40.028]  So you watch some movie of some shaved head big ol' cops with this woman and I know they say the woman was hysterical.
[01:40:40.248 --> 01:40:42.549]  We didn't do this in the past when women got hysterical.
[01:40:43.589 --> 01:40:45.550]  No, everybody's got to submit to you now.
[01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:47.171]  You're law enforcers.
[01:40:47.751 --> 01:40:52.053]  So you taser 90-year-old women because they're blind and deaf and don't follow your orders.
[01:40:53.034 --> 01:40:54.114]  In Oregon.
[01:40:54.375 --> 01:40:54.895]  In Portland.
[01:40:55.715 --> 01:40:59.377]  So you taser a pregnant woman who argues with you about how she wasn't speeding.
[01:41:00.692 --> 01:41:03.914]  It isn't enough to write her a dozen tickets because she's smart-mouthed ya.
[01:41:04.374 --> 01:41:10.497]  Now you're on such an ego trip that you're just going to go ahead and take them in and charge them.
[01:41:10.678 --> 01:41:16.721]  And I get to see all these squad car videos from the cops where they beat you up and then they charge you with assaulting them.
[01:41:19.042 --> 01:41:20.963]  Like that local Austin band that's real popular.
[01:41:20.983 --> 01:41:24.065]  The video ended up getting released.
[01:41:24.265 --> 01:41:24.565]  What is it?
[01:41:24.665 --> 01:41:25.326]  Oza Montley?
[01:41:26.646 --> 01:41:27.627]  The video got released.
[01:41:30.464 --> 01:41:35.949]  And the cops just beat him up and then charge him with attacking them.
[01:41:39.632 --> 01:41:41.133]  Don't you understand that's evil?
[01:41:41.954 --> 01:41:43.315]  Let's finish up with the newscast.
[01:41:43.335 --> 01:41:43.755]  Here it is.
[01:41:44.816 --> 01:41:46.517]  You need to know this is not your fault.
[01:41:47.258 --> 01:41:52.262]  Eventually, Steffi is handcuffed and hauled away to the Stark County Jail to answer questions.
[01:41:52.623 --> 01:41:55.545]  Among them, do you have any weapons or sharp objects?
[01:41:55.945 --> 01:41:57.687]  Have you ever thought of harming yourself?
[01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:05.145]  When Steffi responds, now or ever, she says deputies knock her down and place her feet in a pretzel position.
[01:42:05.445 --> 01:42:07.886]  You have to ask yourself, what was the purpose of this strip search?
[01:42:09.147 --> 01:42:10.348]  What was the necessity of it?
[01:42:10.648 --> 01:42:13.030]  This is a disorderly conduct, Clay.
[01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:17.172]  Steffi repeatedly questions officers about what they're doing.
[01:42:17.192 --> 01:42:18.173]  Let me just stop right there.
[01:42:18.193 --> 01:42:19.534]  Let me just stop right there.
[01:42:20.715 --> 01:42:27.599]  You know why 69% of children nationwide that are in CPS custody are on hardcore psychiatric drugs?
[01:42:28.476 --> 01:42:33.859]  Because when they cry for mommy and daddy, or they seem upset, that's called mental illness.
[01:42:34.339 --> 01:42:39.702]  And now the feds are trying to pass in schools, if a kid rebels in any way, that's a mental illness.
[01:42:39.982 --> 01:42:41.883]  See, it's all about getting you in the system.
[01:42:43.064 --> 01:42:45.905]  And if she wasn't upset, how do you think that woman died at that airport?
[01:42:46.205 --> 01:42:48.306]  They said she hung herself with her handcuffs?
[01:42:49.407 --> 01:42:52.168]  Well, now it's basically come out that they beat the living daylights out of her.
[01:42:52.188 --> 01:42:57.331]  Just like the Polish guy for 17 hours, they won't let him out of the quarantine area,
[01:42:58.687 --> 01:42:59.507]  The holding area.
[01:42:59.847 --> 01:43:00.928]  No one can talk to him.
[01:43:01.148 --> 01:43:02.948]  He finally throws a chair against a wall.
[01:43:03.788 --> 01:43:07.129]  Four big cops jump on his head with his knees and they kill him!
[01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:09.710]  And they say, get up!
[01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:11.251]  Hey, he ain't ever getting up!
[01:43:11.511 --> 01:43:12.351]  He's dead!
[01:43:13.931 --> 01:43:16.452]  The cops didn't used to act like this or behave like this.
[01:43:16.492 --> 01:43:17.472]  You've been ordered to.
[01:43:17.512 --> 01:43:18.633]  It's about intimidation.
[01:43:18.853 --> 01:43:23.734]  I've got the federal documents where they gave you federal grants for black uniforms, masks, armored vehicles.
[01:43:23.954 --> 01:43:25.314]  It's all about intimidating us.
[01:43:25.675 --> 01:43:27.195]  I've got your own federal documents!
[01:43:28.248 --> 01:43:30.909]  Well, let me tell you, you've done the opposite of intimidating people!
[01:43:31.149 --> 01:43:31.909]  We're mad!
[01:43:31.929 --> 01:43:33.849]  Finish up with a clap!
[01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:35.950]  This is horrific.
[01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:40.991]  This is a government agency forcing their will on a citizen.
[01:43:41.591 --> 01:43:50.134]  Stephanie pleads for deputies to stop, and when they begin removing her underwear and bra, she begins to scream.
[01:43:54.355 --> 01:43:55.375]  That should be your wife.
[01:43:56.562 --> 01:43:57.943]  That could be anybody's wife.
[01:43:58.223 --> 01:43:59.344]  By the way, stop right there!
[01:44:00.124 --> 01:44:21.336]  You know, I played football, and quite a few times I would be involved in a tackle, and I'd end up with about five, six people on top of me, and it might take just 30 seconds for them to get up off of me, but, you know, one 200-pound person falls on you, and then a 250-pound lineman falls on top of you, and you're sitting on top of a running back, and the panic in those 30 seconds
[01:44:23.007 --> 01:44:26.910]  The panic in those 30 seconds, you want them to get off, but you know you've got to wait.
[01:44:29.692 --> 01:44:34.035]  But now what they do is when you scream and yell, when five, six people are on you, then they tase you.
[01:44:34.055 --> 01:44:34.916]  They didn't do that here.
[01:44:35.376 --> 01:44:37.437]  They've also got these restraining torture chairs.
[01:44:37.818 --> 01:44:39.339]  People die in those all the time.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.522]  I just want the corrupt, sadistic people doing this to know.
[01:44:44.173 --> 01:44:46.595]  You bought into this system and you're not getting away with it.
[01:44:46.815 --> 01:44:48.316]  Go ahead and drink your water.
[01:44:48.416 --> 01:44:49.877]  Go ahead, trust your government.
[01:44:50.278 --> 01:44:53.880]  Yeah, the ones that trained you to act like this, they wouldn't hurt you.
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:56.202]  Go ahead, give your children the injections.
[01:44:56.282 --> 01:44:56.983]  Go ahead.
[01:44:57.003 --> 01:44:58.484]  Go ahead and give them the mercury.
[01:44:58.504 --> 01:44:59.925]  You got it all figured out.
[01:45:00.065 --> 01:45:01.666]  You're not like us kooks, are you?
[01:45:02.467 --> 01:45:09.672]  See, she had the control of them sitting on top of her to settle down and say, please, please, no, we're taking those panties off.
[01:45:10.563 --> 01:45:13.085]  We're gonna run our hands all over your private parts.
[01:45:13.125 --> 01:45:13.846]  We're men.
[01:45:14.266 --> 01:45:16.268]  This is what we do in America now.
[01:45:16.528 --> 01:45:19.731]  And if you don't like it, you don't like the officers.
[01:45:20.032 --> 01:45:21.633]  You don't like us, do you?
[01:45:21.913 --> 01:45:22.474]  That's what they are.
[01:45:22.494 --> 01:45:23.715]  That's their spirit right there.
[01:45:24.195 --> 01:45:25.076]  Back to the tape!
[01:45:26.317 --> 01:45:27.758]  That could be anybody's wife.
[01:45:28.239 --> 01:45:34.444]  For the next six hours, Steffi was left in a cell completely naked, without even a blanket to cover herself.
[01:45:34.885 --> 01:45:36.086]  And the sheriff admits it.
[01:45:36.949 --> 01:45:43.231]  She says she wrapped herself in toilet paper to keep warm and to prevent anyone else from seeing her nude.
[01:45:43.712 --> 01:45:52.775]  She also says she was denied access to a phone and medical assistance for injuries that included a cracked tooth, a bulging disc, and bruises.
[01:45:54.938 --> 01:45:57.240]  The Sheriff, again, denies the allegation.
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:00.562]  Lawyers for Steffi say the video speaks for itself.
[01:46:01.022 --> 01:46:03.303]  The force used was completely unwarranted.
[01:46:03.444 --> 01:46:11.589]  Her lawyers say this is a script search, and the Sheriff's own policy says officers conducting the search must be of the same sex.
[01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:15.591]  Clearly, in this case, men played a key role.
[01:46:16.432 --> 01:46:21.095]  The last two individuals to leave that cell with her completely naked were both men.
[01:46:22.756 --> 01:46:24.157]  What would any woman fear?
[01:46:27.961 --> 01:46:32.368]  Eventually, Steffi was told she was being charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.
[01:46:32.909 --> 01:46:38.417]  When they took her to booking, her husband says they forced her to wear nothing but a weighted vest like this.
[01:46:39.158 --> 01:46:39.719]  Tomorrow night at 11.
[01:46:40.059 --> 01:46:41.782]  New, exclusive video.
[01:46:42.449 --> 01:46:45.672]  And questions about whether all jailhouse video was released.
[01:46:46.192 --> 01:46:46.372]  Tim?
[01:46:46.853 --> 01:46:47.974]  You're certainly right, Tom.
[01:46:48.034 --> 01:46:50.335]  It's hard to watch and hard to listen to.
[01:46:50.395 --> 01:46:52.457]  Have you heard from the Stark County Sheriff about all this?
[01:46:52.797 --> 01:46:53.158]  I have.
[01:46:53.278 --> 01:46:55.139]  Just this afternoon he emailed me.
[01:46:55.219 --> 01:46:57.081]  He says he'll do most of his talking in court.
[01:46:57.381 --> 01:47:01.324]  But he did say they stripped Steffi of all her clothes for her own safety.
[01:47:01.625 --> 01:47:06.368]  He admits they forcibly removed her clothes because she refused to remove them voluntarily.
[01:47:06.408 --> 01:47:08.710]  Now her husband says that's just not true.
[01:47:09.070 --> 01:47:12.153]  He says deputies stripped her without asking a single question.
[01:47:12.293 --> 01:47:15.595]  With men in the room.
[01:47:18.057 --> 01:47:19.438]  And I just want to tell you something.
[01:47:19.498 --> 01:47:21.039]  They've bought incinerators.
[01:47:21.079 --> 01:47:23.220]  This has been in the Rocky Mountain Moves.
[01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:25.442]  They've bought massive ovens to burn our bodies.
[01:47:26.102 --> 01:47:28.444]  They've built giant camps for you and your family.
[01:47:28.844 --> 01:47:33.327]  They've recruited 26,000 preachers to tell you to submit while they're taking your children from you.
[01:47:33.968 --> 01:47:44.216]  And they will do it, and they will line you up and put 45s at the back of your head, and they'll splatter your brains everywhere, and they're gonna fill giant pits full of our dead bodies if they get their way.
[01:47:45.437 --> 01:47:53.643]  They are all being... This is only the beginning, and they're playing all this on purpose just to get you ready for it, to sell you on accepting all of this.
[01:47:53.723 --> 01:47:56.985]  And I know there's people out there making excuses for all this right now.
[01:47:57.686 --> 01:47:59.547]  Why didn't we behave like this in the past?
[01:47:59.567 --> 01:48:01.549]  I mean, I've got stacks of news here.
[01:48:03.146 --> 01:48:05.729]  With the scum that runs this country.
[01:48:07.731 --> 01:48:09.973]  Now, you wanted me to watch it, and I watched it, and I got mad.
[01:48:11.495 --> 01:48:12.816]  Callers called in and said, have you seen it?
[01:48:13.377 --> 01:48:18.002]  Frankly, I saw this days ago, people sent it to me, and I just couldn't hit the link.
[01:48:18.042 --> 01:48:23.708]  Yeah, I've gotten to the point where... In fact, I mean, let me just give you the headlines I've got here in front of me.
[01:48:25.945 --> 01:48:27.726]  Police set to search for guns at homes.
[01:48:27.766 --> 01:48:30.207]  Voluntary program is issue and community.
[01:48:30.727 --> 01:48:31.027]  Study.
[01:48:31.087 --> 01:48:33.028]  Artificial sweeteners increase weight gain odds.
[01:48:33.088 --> 01:48:33.548]  ABC.
[01:48:34.128 --> 01:48:35.209]  Return of the blackout.
[01:48:35.529 --> 01:48:38.410]  Crime fear is council swish off street lights to save the planet.
[01:48:38.650 --> 01:48:43.832]  No, that's conditioning to show you that we're in crisis and we've got to accept having our resources controlled.
[01:48:44.773 --> 01:48:45.093]  U.S.
[01:48:45.133 --> 01:48:47.094]  charges six suspects over 9-11.
[01:48:47.134 --> 01:48:48.534]  They've been tortured for six years.
[01:48:48.554 --> 01:48:49.715]  They'll confess whatever they're told.
[01:48:50.602 --> 01:48:55.164]  Police launch dawn raid on Boy 12 over school fight SWAT team.
[01:48:55.204 --> 01:48:56.004]  Hit them, hit them hard.
[01:48:56.705 --> 01:48:59.406]  Israel minister warns of army offensive against Gaza.
[01:49:00.726 --> 01:49:01.807]  It just goes on and on.
[01:49:03.347 --> 01:49:06.309]  Snub of Marine starts war over words in Toledo.
[01:49:06.649 --> 01:49:09.710]  They said, no, you can't have an urban warfare takeover drill in our city.
[01:49:09.730 --> 01:49:10.410]  I want to get to that.
[01:49:11.431 --> 01:49:12.311]  Many believe U.S.
[01:49:12.391 --> 01:49:13.411]  already in a recession.
[01:49:14.112 --> 01:49:14.612]  Weak U.S.
[01:49:14.632 --> 01:49:16.293]  dollar makes life tougher for immigrants.
[01:49:16.353 --> 01:49:16.693]  Boo hoo.
[01:49:17.532 --> 01:49:20.554]  Police go live-monitoring DC crime cameras.
[01:49:20.574 --> 01:49:25.156]  Remember they were putting up all these cameras for 10 years going, they're not for crime, they're not going to watch.
[01:49:25.196 --> 01:49:26.977]  You shut up, that's a conspiracy.
[01:49:28.298 --> 01:49:28.858]  Doesn't matter.
[01:49:30.018 --> 01:49:30.439]  Doesn't matter.
[01:49:30.619 --> 01:49:34.361]  All you that serve the system, you're going to have everything you got taken away.
[01:49:36.922 --> 01:49:38.883]  You like your evil devil system?
[01:49:39.003 --> 01:49:39.563]  Okay.
[01:49:40.364 --> 01:49:41.384]  Well, I've studied history.
[01:49:41.404 --> 01:49:44.806]  Let me tell you, this evil servants get the worst end of it.
[01:49:46.207 --> 01:49:46.870]  That's right.
[01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:47.673]  You like evil.
[01:49:47.954 --> 01:49:49.017]  You want to make excuses.
[01:49:49.058 --> 01:49:50.543]  You've turned yourself over to evil.
[01:49:50.864 --> 01:49:51.687]  You go right ahead.

[01:50:54.222 --> 01:51:06.977]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:07.378 --> 01:51:14.106]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:51:14.466 --> 01:51:18.049]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:51:18.429 --> 01:51:21.631]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:51:21.831 --> 01:51:23.553]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.

[01:51:44.087 --> 01:51:44.347]  We're good.
[01:51:55.131 --> 01:51:58.513]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:51:58.653 --> 01:52:03.856]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:52:04.056 --> 01:52:08.818]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:52:09.098 --> 01:52:20.224]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:52:20.524 --> 01:52:26.066]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.

[01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:02.903]  I want to explain something to everybody listening.
[01:53:02.923 --> 01:53:07.365]  3,500 plus children were taken and they're never coming back!
[01:53:07.805 --> 01:53:10.286]  Yeah!
[01:53:10.747 --> 01:53:11.787]  Yeah!
[01:53:13.668 --> 01:53:15.369]  Let me explain something to everybody.
[01:53:19.745 --> 01:53:20.746]  You know what that means?
[01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:25.109]  You know what they'll do?
[01:53:28.552 --> 01:53:46.987]  It means that it could come out in the news that the pedophile CPS run by pedophiles in Florida the entire command structure it came out were hardcore child rapists and nothing happened to them!
[01:53:48.954 --> 01:53:53.896]  And then an investigation about where the 3,000-plus missing children were went away.
[01:53:54.716 --> 01:53:59.058]  Now it turned out that hundreds, they just had misplaced the files and didn't even know what foster care they were.
[01:53:59.398 --> 01:54:04.279]  But thousands, they couldn't answer where they were, and a bunch of them got found in different countries or dead.
[01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:07.040]  That's your government!
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:10.862]  Oh, but they'll have AMBER Alerts, which are nothing but federal takeover drills.
[01:54:11.102 --> 01:54:13.643]  Even in the future, it won't be missing kids that are getting announced on those.
[01:54:13.663 --> 01:54:14.883]  I have the federal documents on that.
[01:54:15.754 --> 01:54:17.196]  Part of all the EAS system.
[01:54:17.236 --> 01:54:24.643]  Now you've heard, FBI says they're going to be flashing anti-terror warnings on big billboards everywhere, big computer jumbo screens, right out of 1984.
[01:54:25.784 --> 01:54:26.805]  But that's your government.
[01:54:27.046 --> 01:54:29.028]  And by the way, I know what the New World Order's doing.
[01:54:29.628 --> 01:54:32.671]  You've still got a lot of good police and a lot of good people in the military.
[01:54:33.833 --> 01:54:34.133]  Okay?
[01:54:35.314 --> 01:54:36.956]  You've got a lot of good people left in there.
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:55.666]  And so we get on air, and we yell and scream at the police, and we get mad at the cops, and we freak out over stuff like this, because the feds have written the training manuals that they follow, that get them into this type of bull, and then we come and attack the cops and yell and scream at them, and that compacts their gang mentality psychology.
[01:54:56.366 --> 01:55:04.649]  See, just like street gangs get attacked, get arrested, get demonized in the community, that makes them, read your own gang handbooks, cops, they're using the same psychology on you.
[01:55:05.726 --> 01:55:08.967]  And that compacts them psychologically more into the group.
[01:55:10.608 --> 01:55:12.249]  And so, see, I get outraged.
[01:55:12.529 --> 01:55:15.530]  Look, I usually don't try to come on here and bash the police.
[01:55:16.191 --> 01:55:16.931]  You heard the caller.
[01:55:16.971 --> 01:55:17.931]  Have you seen the video?
[01:55:17.991 --> 01:55:19.232]  No, I can't watch it.
[01:55:19.792 --> 01:55:22.533]  And sure enough, I had to sit here and play it over air and watch it.
[01:55:23.774 --> 01:55:25.695]  And now I'm just completely angry.
[01:55:27.896 --> 01:55:29.076]  Look, I know we got loaded phones.
[01:55:29.096 --> 01:55:30.497]  I got a bunch of martial law clips.
[01:55:30.517 --> 01:55:31.818]  Some new, some old I want to play.
[01:55:37.435 --> 01:55:44.561]  It's just the magnitude of the evil that they do all this evil right out in front of us and they don't get in trouble.
[01:55:45.542 --> 01:55:59.493]  I mean, when they ghoulishly come on television and say torture is good, when they ghoulishly come on television and try to sell you, and then the Army report says that they were doing things to children I can't mention, and it's like stuff out of the movie Saw.
[01:55:59.893 --> 01:56:04.817]  I haven't seen the movies, I have just read the synopsis of it, or Hostile.
[01:56:06.622 --> 01:56:10.105]  I mean, they take little kids, the army does, and they do things I can't even mention.
[01:56:10.426 --> 01:56:17.232]  And the media releases images of people in naked pyramids and says, and Rush Limbaugh says they're just blowing off steam, having some fun.
[01:56:19.534 --> 01:56:25.740]  See, they show you the lesser photos to try to then sell you on evil, to seduce you, to brainwash you.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:27.982]  It's happening to all of us, not just the police.
[01:56:28.482 --> 01:56:30.264]  I will not be part of it.
[01:56:35.529 --> 01:56:37.110]  This system has collapsed.
[01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:40.131]  The country is collapsing financially.
[01:56:41.131 --> 01:56:42.971]  They are openly set up martial law.
[01:56:44.252 --> 01:56:45.372]  We're already in martial law.
[01:56:45.412 --> 01:56:47.473]  It's what increment of martial law are we going to be in?
[01:56:49.554 --> 01:56:53.135]  And I'm very depressed and upset about the outlook of this country because it's all going to happen now.
[01:56:53.495 --> 01:56:54.855]  They've done everything they said they do.
[01:56:55.115 --> 01:56:56.136]  They're following it all.
[01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:58.497]  They're just like they're going down a checklist.
[01:56:58.597 --> 01:57:02.758]  And my God, to every police officer, everybody out there who serves this system,
[01:57:03.949 --> 01:57:05.831]  It's, I mean, you're going to get hurt in this too.
[01:57:05.891 --> 01:57:06.812]  I just hope you know that.
[01:57:08.233 --> 01:57:11.455]  And nine chances out of ten, it's going to be your bosses that are doing the hurting.
[01:57:11.475 --> 01:57:14.678]  God, I can't believe this.
[01:57:14.798 --> 01:57:16.359]  And they've recruited all the big preachers.
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:20.622]  And, uh, it's all happening.
[01:57:20.642 --> 01:57:23.344]  Alright, I'm going to take calls.
[01:57:23.365 --> 01:57:25.526]  I'm going to get the calls that have been holding the longest out of the way.
[01:57:25.546 --> 01:57:28.729]  And then I'm going to get in all this martial law news and the rest of it.
[01:57:29.529 --> 01:57:30.150]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:34.838 --> 01:57:40.424]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:40.464 --> 01:57:49.654]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.595 --> 01:57:51.275]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.896 --> 01:57:52.997]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.678 --> 01:57:54.779]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:56.221]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.997 --> 01:57:58.899]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.919 --> 01:58:02.162]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.742 --> 01:58:06.846]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.512 --> 01:58:17.355]  Steve, Jennifer, George, Chris, others, you're called right now.
[01:58:17.415 --> 01:58:18.716]  Steve and Canada, you're on the air.
[01:58:21.513 --> 01:58:21.934]  How are you?
[01:58:22.154 --> 01:58:22.454]  Good.
[01:58:22.494 --> 01:58:23.015]  I'm alright.
[01:58:23.456 --> 01:58:23.856]  Excellent.
[01:58:24.177 --> 01:58:24.557]  Excellent.
[01:58:24.978 --> 01:58:26.240]  Long time listener.
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:27.061]  First time caller.
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:56.379]  About nine months ago, there were reports out of Montreal, basically it came through Canadian Action Party with Connie Fogel, they were reporting that the same Israeli surveillance company that was in charge of the rail lines in London for the 7-7 bombings had got a no-bid contract for the transit system in Montreal, and I thought, okay, what's going on here?
[01:58:56.399 --> 01:58:57.079]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:58:58.672 --> 01:59:02.574]  I don't know if you're aware of this, but our lovely Prime Minister, G.W.
[01:59:02.654 --> 01:59:25.628]  Harper, as we like to call him here, is calling an election based on our extension of the Afghanistan, our troops staying in Afghanistan for an extra couple of years, and the overall consensus here amongst the population is that it's leaning towards not extending that, the general population is.
[01:59:26.224 --> 01:59:31.006]  And one of the biggest opposition areas happens to be in the Montreal, Quebec area.
[01:59:31.587 --> 01:59:34.028]  I'm just wondering if... I don't know.
[01:59:34.348 --> 01:59:42.932]  The police, the federal police, were caught dressed up like protesters, assaulting police with deadly weapons so they could then falsely charge innocent people, and that got confirmed!
[01:59:43.152 --> 01:59:45.853]  Confirmed criminal false flag terror attack!
[01:59:45.873 --> 01:59:49.235]  They call hitting a cop with a giant rock upside the head a terror attack!
[01:59:51.196 --> 01:59:51.496]  I don't know.
[01:59:51.556 --> 01:59:52.897]  It just smells...
[01:59:53.803 --> 02:00:03.529]  It smells really bad, and any of the people that are in the Quebec, Montreal area, maybe just point it out to a few people.
[02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:09.113]  Like you've pointed out so many times, sometimes when you expose it ahead of time, they don't do it.
[02:00:09.834 --> 02:00:12.635]  It just smells really bad.
[02:00:12.836 --> 02:00:22.442]  There's no way he's going to call an election when there's a pretty good chance he's going to lose, unless there's something in the works that's going to sway
[02:00:23.038 --> 02:00:23.558]  The people.
[02:00:24.059 --> 02:00:27.961]  Well, they might just deliver more ammonium nitrate to some innocent kids.
[02:00:29.181 --> 02:00:34.925]  Yeah, like they did in Toronto there and, you know, try and set up 16 youngsters there with the RCMP leading the whole thing.
[02:00:34.945 --> 02:00:39.187]  Or they might find idiots and give them the bombs and let them do it like they did with the first World Trade Center attack.
[02:00:39.347 --> 02:00:40.208]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:00:40.828 --> 02:00:47.912]  I just figured, I know there's a lot of Canadian listeners and I'm sure there's a bunch in Montreal, like in Quebec and in the Montreal area, I just figured.
[02:00:48.419 --> 02:00:51.522]  I kind of put these pieces together here and thought it made sense.
[02:00:51.702 --> 02:00:52.863]  No, it makes a lot of sense.
[02:00:52.883 --> 02:00:53.343]  Thank you.
[02:00:53.363 --> 02:00:54.824]  Good to hear from you.
[02:00:55.405 --> 02:00:56.906]  Jennifer in Texas, go ahead.
[02:00:56.926 --> 02:00:58.207]  Hello.
[02:00:59.428 --> 02:00:59.788]  Welcome.
[02:01:00.809 --> 02:01:01.310]  Thank you.
[02:01:01.330 --> 02:01:09.837]  This weekend I acted on a very small spark of courage and I gathered with fellow Ron supporters on my town square.
[02:01:09.877 --> 02:01:17.363]  I raised my voice and I shared with my fellow citizens issues regarding the Federal Reserve
[02:01:17.893 --> 02:01:21.616]  McCain's positions on Iraq and commitments of our troops.
[02:01:22.356 --> 02:01:23.657]  At first I was laughed at.
[02:01:24.678 --> 02:01:33.845]  Then I used the wisdom of the founding fathers like James Madison when he said, oppression and tyranny will come to this nation in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy.
[02:01:34.705 --> 02:01:45.053]  As I shared this with them, their expressions went from scorn to curiosity, and then I could see that they were taking the sin.
[02:01:46.593 --> 02:01:50.294]  And I felt a great weight lifted from my shoulders as I shared this.
[02:01:51.495 --> 02:01:57.337]  And I also recognize that there's a great spiritual blindness in the church regarding these matters.
[02:01:57.797 --> 02:01:59.797]  Well, it's not blindness.
[02:01:59.817 --> 02:02:01.498]  Most of the big preachers are on the payroll.
[02:02:02.178 --> 02:02:02.878]  I understand.
[02:02:02.898 --> 02:02:08.140]  Think about how chilling that is, that secret government funding and control of the preachers.
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:09.401]  Folks, we're so far gone.
[02:02:10.021 --> 02:02:13.242]  Yes, and as I shared this information with one pastor,
[02:02:13.789 --> 02:02:16.711]  ...these matters, he sat and looked at me, glared at me.
[02:02:17.552 --> 02:02:20.193]  And he said, I'm fully aware of this.
[02:02:20.374 --> 02:02:20.474]  Oh!
[02:02:20.514 --> 02:02:20.954]  Oh!
[02:02:21.074 --> 02:02:21.715]  Oh, stay there!
[02:02:21.775 --> 02:02:22.735]  Oh, sorry, stay there!
[02:02:22.875 --> 02:02:23.316]  Oh!
[02:02:23.876 --> 02:02:25.257]  Oh, I bet he's on the payroll.
[02:02:26.138 --> 02:02:28.559]  The payroll of the government, secretly.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:30.861]  That isn't freedom.
[02:02:31.401 --> 02:02:34.243]  When the government is running an intelligence op.
[02:02:34.924 --> 02:02:36.845]  An infiltration takeover op.
[02:02:37.926 --> 02:02:38.386]  Stay there.
[02:02:38.526 --> 02:02:39.447]  I want to hear about this.
[02:02:39.467 --> 02:02:41.028]  This preacher glaring at you.
[02:02:42.057 --> 02:02:45.158]  I know all about it!
[02:02:46.219 --> 02:02:46.859]  It's progressing.
[02:02:47.279 --> 02:02:51.181]  And it's only a short time until it's completely taken over every aspect of your life.
[02:02:51.661 --> 02:02:53.102]  We are entering Martial Law.
[02:02:53.582 --> 02:02:55.743]  There are ten telling signs of Martial Law.

[02:03:48.171 --> 02:03:51.635]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:03:51.796 --> 02:03:54.098]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:03:54.258 --> 02:03:57.001]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:03:57.322 --> 02:04:02.828]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:04:03.108 --> 02:04:07.053]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:04:07.373 --> 02:04:12.315]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:04:12.595 --> 02:04:15.376]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:04:22.939 --> 02:04:28.781]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[02:04:28.941 --> 02:04:33.463]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:04:33.803 --> 02:04:36.344]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:04:36.664 --> 02:04:38.305]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:04:38.725 --> 02:04:40.486]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:04:40.726 --> 02:04:42.567]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:04:42.867 --> 02:04:44.308]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:04:44.688 --> 02:04:45.509]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:04:46.661 --> 02:04:48.502]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[02:04:48.703 --> 02:04:51.765]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:04:52.005 --> 02:04:56.628]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:04:56.969 --> 02:04:59.591]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:04:59.871 --> 02:05:06.736]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:05:06.936 --> 02:05:12.660]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:14.622]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[02:05:15.162 --> 02:05:18.904]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:30.352]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[02:05:30.752 --> 02:05:35.816]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[02:05:36.036 --> 02:05:39.078]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[02:05:39.298 --> 02:05:39.919]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:05:40.039 --> 02:05:41.500]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today!
[02:05:45.942 --> 02:05:51.986]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.412 --> 02:06:04.974]  Look, I'm like a cornered animal.
[02:06:07.335 --> 02:06:08.296]  It isn't my opinion.
[02:06:09.404 --> 02:06:17.611]  I've been to the urban warfare drills, I've seen the Army secretly working with the police, I've interviewed guests, I've brought you secret documents years before it's in the news.
[02:06:18.852 --> 02:06:25.417]  When they recruit 26,000 creatures to secretly work for the government to prepare you for martial law, that's in the documents.
[02:06:26.378 --> 02:06:28.760]  Do you understand that is bold tyranny.
[02:06:29.261 --> 02:06:30.602]  That is as bad as it gets.
[02:06:30.662 --> 02:06:34.285]  They are lined up, they are all around us, they've put their grid in place.
[02:06:35.316 --> 02:06:42.601]  And if we don't get the word out to the people about this being tyranny and this being run by bad people, they're going to engage it and they're going to get away with it.
[02:06:46.003 --> 02:06:48.765]  And they aren't going to be mainly coming at the people that have even been fighting them.
[02:06:48.925 --> 02:06:49.665]  They do that too.
[02:06:50.066 --> 02:06:51.066]  It's people's property.
[02:06:51.306 --> 02:06:52.167]  It's pension funds.
[02:06:52.207 --> 02:06:53.248]  It's social security.
[02:06:53.668 --> 02:06:54.328]  It's all of it.
[02:06:54.368 --> 02:07:02.834]  We are a nation of ignorant, decadent people who have been totally taken by scientific minds
[02:07:06.883 --> 02:07:07.743]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[02:07:07.783 --> 02:07:08.624]  Jennifer, finish up.
[02:07:08.844 --> 02:07:12.746]  So you're at the local town, at a courthouse, you were saying?
[02:07:13.006 --> 02:07:13.466]  Where were you?
[02:07:13.486 --> 02:07:15.167]  You were giving speeches with the Ron Paul group?
[02:07:15.187 --> 02:07:15.587]  What happened?
[02:07:15.787 --> 02:07:16.788]  Right, exactly.
[02:07:16.868 --> 02:07:23.371]  And the citizens first laughed at me, and then they began to absorb that information.
[02:07:23.391 --> 02:07:28.453]  And then I was talking about sitting with the pastor.
[02:07:29.173 --> 02:07:34.956]  And I was sharing this information with him regarding police state and other things.
[02:07:36.078 --> 02:07:51.161]  And he just sat and glared at me, and he said, I'm fully aware of these matters, but due to the daily burdens of the life of the congregation, they can't bear or digest this information.
[02:07:51.181 --> 02:08:04.604]  Then he sat and looked, and I mean it was a contempt, that's the only adjective I can come up with, and he said, you will not disseminate this information to the congregation.
[02:08:06.152 --> 02:08:12.857]  He said, and if I find out that you do, if you're causing discord in the church, then there are going to be consequences.
[02:08:14.819 --> 02:08:16.440]  And I couldn't believe it.
[02:08:17.481 --> 02:08:22.865]  Because at the time I thought, well, of anybody, the pastors will want to know.
[02:08:23.265 --> 02:08:26.187]  Of anyone... But see what America's got to learn.
[02:08:26.227 --> 02:08:26.848]  Let me stop you.
[02:08:26.968 --> 02:08:28.029]  You're not supposed to talk.
[02:08:28.049 --> 02:08:29.630]  You're not supposed to talk about it.
[02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:33.553]  But the sickest part is he admitted to you that he knew it was true, but see, it's a power trip.
[02:08:33.873 --> 02:08:35.775]  Because they've been included in these programs.
[02:08:36.770 --> 02:08:42.214]  And because they're, whether it's the Catholic Church or Protestant churches, they're all on the payroll of big ones now.
[02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:45.857]  They're on the power trip because, see, they've been let in on it.
[02:08:45.937 --> 02:08:49.720]  It's like all these big corporate chiefs being made deputy FBI agents.
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:54.784]  It's all part of being part of the power trip, and they're going to be... I mean, why do we need this?
[02:08:54.804 --> 02:08:55.864]  This isn't for terror!
[02:08:55.924 --> 02:08:58.927]  This entire system they've built is for us!
[02:08:59.007 --> 02:09:00.068]  It's for the average person!
[02:09:00.448 --> 02:09:01.308]  They admit it is!
[02:09:01.369 --> 02:09:02.529]  It's for attacking us!
[02:09:02.609 --> 02:09:03.170]  It's evil!
[02:09:03.977 --> 02:09:05.018]  And it's here!
[02:09:05.538 --> 02:09:09.181]  So what did you say to him after that?
[02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:10.322]  I just looked at him.
[02:09:10.402 --> 02:09:11.983]  I couldn't... I was speechless.
[02:09:12.203 --> 02:09:21.070]  And I mean, I had a sense of dread that came over me and I said, you know, Scripture tells us that we are supposed to be watchmen.
[02:09:21.771 --> 02:09:24.593]  That we're supposed to look for the signs of the times.
[02:09:24.693 --> 02:09:26.815]  That we're supposed to be aware of this.
[02:09:28.356 --> 02:09:29.697]  And this is your job!
[02:09:31.451 --> 02:09:37.672]  You're here as a man of God, you're supposed to communicate this, and you're refusing to do so?
[02:09:37.692 --> 02:09:42.293]  And he just said, you're not going to cause discord in this church.
[02:09:45.414 --> 02:09:46.494]  And that was the end of it.
[02:09:47.994 --> 02:09:53.155]  And my fellow Christians who are listening, you've got to wake up.
[02:09:53.416 --> 02:09:54.316]  Where do you go to church?
[02:09:55.396 --> 02:10:00.497]  Well, my husband is a veteran, and at the time we were in Florida.
[02:10:01.446 --> 02:10:03.168]  And this was about three years ago.
[02:10:03.929 --> 02:10:09.134]  And I talk to members of the community here individually about it.
[02:10:09.474 --> 02:10:13.418]  And that's where I find it works best, if you talk to individual Christians.
[02:10:13.698 --> 02:10:15.100]  I've given up on the pastors.
[02:10:16.521 --> 02:10:18.403]  And now I talk to people individually.
[02:10:18.643 --> 02:10:19.003]  I hear you.
[02:10:19.023 --> 02:10:20.044]  Good to hear from you, Jennifer.
[02:10:20.084 --> 02:10:21.205]  Listen, this is what's happened.
[02:10:21.906 --> 02:10:22.266]  Until 1955 or so,
[02:10:24.457 --> 02:10:33.242]  There was no federal regulations over churches because the First Amendment states, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the exercise thereof.
[02:10:34.082 --> 02:10:38.065]  Then it goes on to the press or the people or right to assemble and redress of grievance.
[02:10:40.426 --> 02:10:47.670]  But once they got the World Council of Churches to come in and with federal funds, and now they're openly paying them,
[02:10:49.147 --> 02:10:51.989]  You know, when you hear about, oh, faith-based initiatives, you think it's for soup kitchens.
[02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:54.731]  No, it's the feds buying the preachers.
[02:10:54.751 --> 02:10:55.692]  I mean, they're getting paychecks.
[02:10:56.813 --> 02:10:57.053]  Okay?
[02:10:57.073 --> 02:10:58.074]  I mean, it's like a full-time job.
[02:10:58.094 --> 02:11:02.057]  They're getting some of them large checks, some smaller checks, depending on the size of their church.
[02:11:02.638 --> 02:11:04.319]  I mean, this is a paycheck directly to them.
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:07.762]  And it's intelligence.
[02:11:07.782 --> 02:11:08.983]  They're told to keep quiet.
[02:11:09.003 --> 02:11:11.845]  It's a secret pact between the preachers and the government.
[02:11:11.885 --> 02:11:14.487]  I mean, that is just off the charts tyranny.
[02:11:15.845 --> 02:11:17.747]  That is as bad as it gets!
[02:11:17.907 --> 02:11:18.767]  And what are they teaching?
[02:11:18.827 --> 02:11:24.412]  Gun confiscation, submit to government, go to the camps, let them take your children, take the forced inoculation.
[02:11:24.692 --> 02:11:27.314]  They're not doing that because they want to play patty cake.
[02:11:27.815 --> 02:11:29.316]  They're doing that because they're planning to do it.
[02:11:31.578 --> 02:11:36.221]  Now the good news is, is people like Willie Nelson are coming on this show because they want to talk about these issues.
[02:11:36.642 --> 02:11:38.163]  And other prominent people are speaking out.
[02:11:38.703 --> 02:11:44.428]  And, you know, the plots in TV movies are about this now because the people do have their mind on this subject.
[02:11:47.586 --> 02:11:49.507]  The government is going up against the people.
[02:11:49.547 --> 02:11:51.247]  It has nothing to do with Alciada.
[02:11:51.507 --> 02:11:53.228]  That's just their excuse and their pretext.
[02:11:59.389 --> 02:12:00.770]  George in Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:01.350]  Thanks for holding.
[02:12:01.950 --> 02:12:02.770]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[02:12:03.911 --> 02:12:05.431]  I think I know where all this is going.
[02:12:05.671 --> 02:12:11.073]  I live by myself, just me and my dog, so I have a lot of time to think, and I don't talk as much, so I hear an awful lot.
[02:12:11.573 --> 02:12:13.133]  Here's what I see is going to happen, Alex.
[02:12:13.693 --> 02:12:16.154]  Unfortunately, I think Hillary's going to become president.
[02:12:16.914 --> 02:12:23.902]  Over the past few years, we've been bombarded with chemtrails, poison air, poison food, poison water.
[02:12:23.922 --> 02:12:29.949]  This is all what I think they're doing is to lower our resistance, and then they're going to release a bioweapon.
[02:12:29.989 --> 02:12:31.751]  Not a nuclear bomb, but a bioweapon.
[02:12:32.192 --> 02:12:33.213]  It's going to kill people.
[02:12:33.453 --> 02:12:35.576]  This is where the preachers are going to come in and say,
[02:12:36.147 --> 02:12:40.048]  We all have to go to the camps, we have to get these shots to make sure we stay safe.
[02:12:40.288 --> 02:12:48.789]  And they're going to have an emergency reorganization into total government control and government jobs, the national ID cards, all of it put in infrastructure beforehand, and then it's over, yeah.
[02:12:48.969 --> 02:12:52.690]  And Hillary, the mother, is going to cry on TV and tell you to do this.
[02:12:53.050 --> 02:12:58.611]  When you get to those camps, the red and blue tags probably tell you what kind of inoculation you're going to get.
[02:12:58.991 --> 02:13:02.052]  One that's going to kill you right away or get rid of you a little later.
[02:13:02.112 --> 02:13:03.172]  That'll take care of their 80 to 85 percent.
[02:13:05.646 --> 02:13:07.867]  And they can do it without dropping a bomb or shooting a bullet.
[02:13:09.667 --> 02:13:11.508]  They've killed how many microbiologists?
[02:13:12.048 --> 02:13:13.688]  They've been setting this up for years.
[02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:16.549]  They're killing the people that can find the cure.
[02:13:17.609 --> 02:13:19.070]  Or people who worked on the program.
[02:13:19.450 --> 02:13:20.010]  Exactly.
[02:13:20.830 --> 02:13:22.091]  And so they've got the cure.
[02:13:22.111 --> 02:13:23.311]  They don't have to worry.
[02:13:24.211 --> 02:13:25.212]  But a whole lot of us do.
[02:13:26.652 --> 02:13:28.873]  Unfortunately, what you're saying is in the cards.
[02:13:30.553 --> 02:13:32.514]  Well, I'll be with you until it's over.
[02:13:33.732 --> 02:13:36.813]  Alex, you know what makes me think you're probably right that they may do this?
[02:13:37.433 --> 02:13:45.956]  We know it's in the cards, they've said it's not a question of it, but when this happens, they're saying that, is the way that they don't care what we think anymore.
[02:13:45.996 --> 02:13:47.376]  They know we know they're lying.
[02:13:47.416 --> 02:13:51.758]  They know the Congress has an 11% approval rating, and Gallup 20% in AP.
[02:13:52.178 --> 02:13:53.658]  They know, and they just don't care.
[02:13:53.698 --> 02:13:56.699]  It's like they know there's a finish line, and they just laugh at us.
[02:13:57.279 --> 02:13:57.459]  Yep.
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:13:59.920]  So I'm doing everything I can.
[02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:02.761]  A lot of the products that you sell on air, I'm buying and storing.
[02:14:03.194 --> 02:14:04.934]  I can't get a lot of my friends to know.
[02:14:04.954 --> 02:14:10.175]  I mean, if they don't feel like they want to hear the truth, I'm not telling them what I'm doing.
[02:14:11.136 --> 02:14:13.836]  And everybody should be smart and not let anybody know what you've got.
[02:14:14.856 --> 02:14:17.697]  Yeah, a lot of citizens think it's illegal to store food now.
[02:14:17.717 --> 02:14:19.017]  They think that's what evil people do.
[02:14:20.798 --> 02:14:26.779]  Well, how many days can most of the people that are listening on your line right now live out of their house?
[02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:29.019]  Four or five days, they'll be looking at that dog.
[02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:31.780]  Or cat.
[02:14:33.553 --> 02:14:35.013]  Or worse.
[02:14:35.073 --> 02:14:36.434]  Look what happened in Germany.
[02:14:37.714 --> 02:14:40.294]  I mean, my God, there were women eating their children.
[02:14:41.655 --> 02:14:42.935]  And it could get that bad.
[02:14:42.995 --> 02:14:46.396]  So if anybody thinks you're joking, they've got a real problem.
[02:14:46.436 --> 02:14:48.896]  They'll wake up one morning and it'll all be over.
[02:14:49.856 --> 02:14:50.597]  I'm going to say this.
[02:14:50.617 --> 02:14:52.937]  I have never had such a sense of dread.
[02:14:52.997 --> 02:14:55.158]  It is so strong in my soul right now.
[02:14:55.518 --> 02:14:56.738]  I literally can hardly talk.
[02:14:56.758 --> 02:14:57.778]  The dread.
[02:15:00.119 --> 02:15:00.559]  I shake.
[02:15:01.079 --> 02:15:01.979]  I shake all the time.
[02:15:05.327 --> 02:15:08.728]  God, there's so many innocent people who are going to die.
[02:15:08.748 --> 02:15:10.109]  I've got 17 grandchildren, Alex.
[02:15:12.570 --> 02:15:13.610]  I don't know what I'm going to do.
[02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:17.291]  You can just look at these evil people running things.
[02:15:17.311 --> 02:15:18.031]  They just love it.
[02:15:18.532 --> 02:15:25.174]  The way they tore out Europe, the way they tore out Russia, the way they killed 60 plus men in China, the way our government put Mao in and now admits it.
[02:15:25.514 --> 02:15:27.515]  They love just totally tearing out societies.
[02:15:27.535 --> 02:15:28.415]  They get off on it.
[02:15:29.095 --> 02:15:32.416]  And I just can't believe that we'd have these people running things.
[02:15:32.456 --> 02:15:33.617]  I mean, it's just sick!
[02:15:35.104 --> 02:15:36.625]  I'm telling you, I don't know what it is.
[02:15:36.966 --> 02:15:37.906]  I don't have a TV.
[02:15:38.287 --> 02:15:43.070]  But one of my friends watches Fox News and he thinks all of this is crazy.
[02:15:43.450 --> 02:15:48.474]  They must have some way to brainwash the masses through that television or something.
[02:15:48.514 --> 02:15:51.376]  Because anybody that watches a lot of TV, they're brain dead.
[02:15:54.419 --> 02:15:56.360]  And Fox does a real good job.
[02:15:56.420 --> 02:16:00.944]  I mean, I hate O'Reilly so much when I see his face I grit my teeth.
[02:16:01.364 --> 02:16:02.945]  But they do a real good job.
[02:16:03.065 --> 02:16:03.966]  Once they get you,
[02:16:04.637 --> 02:16:05.818]  Man, what a sales job!
[02:16:10.863 --> 02:16:12.104]  Yeah, it's all over, folks.
[02:16:12.184 --> 02:16:12.804]  It's all over.
[02:16:13.125 --> 02:16:15.087]  I mean, I have to tell you, they're going for broke.
[02:16:15.267 --> 02:16:23.915]  NAU, I don't know if it's going to be a bio-weapon, but remember how they tried to make the cops and first responders take that smallpox shot in 2002, and most of them refused?
[02:16:24.315 --> 02:16:30.981]  That's the only good news, is that a lot of people now, in their gut... I mean, don't all of you feel it in your gut?
[02:16:31.684 --> 02:16:34.286]  Not just the intellectual level, not just all the signs.
[02:16:34.386 --> 02:16:35.506]  I mean, that one thing.
[02:16:35.927 --> 02:16:41.010]  They secretly recruited 26,000 preachers to get everybody ready for martial law?
[02:16:41.070 --> 02:16:44.792]  I mean, that is... They love Mother Earth.
[02:16:44.912 --> 02:16:49.935]  They're not going to blow up the United States here.
[02:16:49.955 --> 02:16:50.996]  They're not going to use nukes here.
[02:16:51.016 --> 02:16:55.058]  They're going to do something that's going to leave Mother Earth alone, and that's just get rid of the people.
[02:16:55.859 --> 02:16:59.281]  And with these race-specific bioweapons, they can go in any direction.
[02:16:59.661 --> 02:17:00.662]  I think they're just going to just
[02:17:01.203 --> 02:17:01.927]  Throw it out there.
[02:17:01.947 --> 02:17:03.738]  I don't think they're going to worry about getting color.
[02:17:04.019 --> 02:17:05.226]  It's just going to be everybody.
[02:17:06.893 --> 02:17:08.834]  And that would be the safest way for them to go.
[02:17:09.334 --> 02:17:16.257]  If they drop troops on the street, or they drop bombs or anything like that, there's going to be a whole lot of people grabbing guns, and it'll be chaos.
[02:17:16.637 --> 02:17:19.418]  But boy, let some kind of disease come after you.
[02:17:19.438 --> 02:17:23.640]  You'll start killing people, and everybody will be running to the camps, thinking that's the safest place.
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:25.200]  Easiest way to get them in there.
[02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:28.101]  Well, their entire structure is built around that type of attack.
[02:17:28.581 --> 02:17:30.962]  And again, then it drives us all right into the jaws.
[02:17:31.302 --> 02:17:33.183]  People think they're running into a hole to be safe.
[02:17:33.203 --> 02:17:34.444]  They're running right into the jaws.
[02:17:34.844 --> 02:17:35.244]  Exactly.
[02:17:37.101 --> 02:17:37.761]  Oh, man.
[02:17:38.041 --> 02:17:41.402]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, as we face open world government.
[02:17:46.444 --> 02:17:47.844]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:47.864 --> 02:17:49.984]  A new world order.
[02:17:50.685 --> 02:17:54.946]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:17:55.546 --> 02:17:58.347]  It's known as the Bilderberg system.
[02:17:58.407 --> 02:18:00.667]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:18:01.187 --> 02:18:03.608]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.375 --> 02:18:11.701]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:14.716 --> 02:18:19.719]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:23.662]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:24.022 --> 02:18:26.544]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:18:26.604 --> 02:18:27.745]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:27.765 --> 02:18:28.545]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.565 --> 02:18:29.626]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:29.826 --> 02:18:30.246]  They're after power.
[02:18:30.286 --> 02:18:31.527]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[02:18:43.535 --> 02:18:44.516]  You have been warned.
[02:18:45.337 --> 02:18:47.698]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:47.798 --> 02:18:58.265]  Did you know that President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled, The United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[02:18:58.346 --> 02:19:03.529]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations Organization.
[02:19:04.290 --> 02:19:08.753]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[02:19:09.433 --> 02:19:15.116]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.

[02:20:45.109 --> 02:20:46.970]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:53.815]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:20:54.075 --> 02:21:02.240]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:08.183]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:21:09.164 --> 02:21:09.464]  I think so.
[02:21:27.153 --> 02:21:29.254]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[02:21:56.909 --> 02:21:58.371]  Send the Joker to the feet.
[02:21:58.912 --> 02:22:00.273]  There's too much confusion.
[02:22:04.761 --> 02:22:08.502]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[02:22:09.062 --> 02:22:12.143]  Said a joker to the beat.
[02:22:13.404 --> 02:22:15.425]  There's too much confusion.
[02:22:17.805 --> 02:22:20.006]  I can't get no relief.
[02:22:21.327 --> 02:22:25.688]  Mr. Stanton, drink my wine.
[02:22:26.248 --> 02:22:27.969]  Come and dig my earth.
[02:22:33.118 --> 02:22:39.679]  There are all these pundits, Fox, big news wires, they have a talking point.
[02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:52.823]  They say that we, 9-11 troopers, say 9-11 is an inside job, because it's too scary for us to admit that some shadowy group in caves did all this, that it's more comforting to think our government did it and is in control.
[02:22:55.009 --> 02:22:57.410]  How on its face insane is that?
[02:22:57.570 --> 02:23:00.892]  I wish every day Al Qaeda really was real.
[02:23:01.012 --> 02:23:08.436]  I wish it was just some people in a cave and not a bunch of sick eugenicists that think it's good to get rid of us and see us as bad.
[02:23:08.896 --> 02:23:12.358]  And once they have that attitude, there's too many people, and a lot of citizens have that attitude.
[02:23:12.578 --> 02:23:13.358]  They've been brainwashed.
[02:23:13.798 --> 02:23:14.439]  It's all over.
[02:23:15.399 --> 02:23:19.041]  Once there's the attitude that there's too many of us and we're bad, it's over!
[02:23:19.061 --> 02:23:23.003]  Now when you hear these newscasts around the country normally,
[02:23:23.863 --> 02:23:27.665]  You hear, oh, the Marines were training for foreign wars in our city.
[02:23:27.925 --> 02:23:28.865]  But I've been to these drills.
[02:23:28.885 --> 02:23:32.387]  They practice taking over your city, taking your guns, working with city leaders.
[02:23:33.127 --> 02:23:35.108]  And it's all on video in my police state films.
[02:23:36.708 --> 02:23:38.229]  I'm going to start playing these police state clips.
[02:23:38.549 --> 02:23:43.271]  This is a new one out of Toledo, Ohio, where the right thing happened and the mayor threw them out.
[02:23:44.812 --> 02:23:48.313]  Now, we've had cameras at these events when the Marines walk up and say, turn your cameras off.
[02:23:49.314 --> 02:23:51.955]  This is for martial law takeover in America.
[02:23:51.975 --> 02:23:52.735]  You ready for that clip, John?
[02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:54.901]  Here it is.
[02:23:56.662 --> 02:24:08.495]  Kylie, Marine Corps Reservists from Grand Rapids, Michigan were supposed to train here in downtown Toledo, but Mayor Cardi Finkbeiner kicked them out yesterday saying residents downtown would be scared of them.
[02:24:08.856 --> 02:24:12.419]  But as I found out today, many of those residents disagree with the mayor.
[02:24:17.148 --> 02:24:22.213]  You know, I'm not afraid of it, and the military had their rights, and I think Cardi was wrong.
[02:24:22.233 --> 02:24:22.934]  Say all me.
[02:24:23.434 --> 02:24:25.396]  Members of the 1st Battalion... Stop it!
[02:24:25.476 --> 02:24:25.977]  Stop it!
[02:24:26.057 --> 02:24:26.497]  Stop it!
[02:24:26.517 --> 02:24:27.758]  Did you hear that, idiot woman?
[02:24:28.659 --> 02:24:29.280]  Yeah, I didn't.
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:35.426]  The military has their rights, too, like you're pro-military to stick them in Iraq, or pro-military to have them here.
[02:24:36.488 --> 02:24:37.489]  They have their rights.
[02:24:37.789 --> 02:24:40.370]  It's all about not making you scared of it, you idiot!
[02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:43.191]  It's about acclimating you for total takeover!
[02:24:43.532 --> 02:24:46.753]  And so Marines and Army are familiar with every U.S.
[02:24:46.793 --> 02:24:47.153]  city!
[02:24:48.394 --> 02:24:49.795]  I've had my cameras there!
[02:24:50.015 --> 02:24:51.215]  It's for America!
[02:24:51.996 --> 02:24:52.636]  Back to it!
[02:24:54.989 --> 02:24:59.991]  And I'm not afraid of it, and the military had their rights, and I think Cardi was wrong.
[02:25:00.011 --> 02:25:00.751]  Stay on me.
[02:25:01.211 --> 02:25:06.954]  Members of the 1st Battalion, 24th Marines have trained in Toledo before, most recently in May 2006.
[02:25:08.174 --> 02:25:14.637]  But the five-bus convoy was sent packing by Mayor Cardi Finkbeiner after making a brief stop in Perrysburg.
[02:25:15.037 --> 02:25:21.759]  The Toledo Police Department knew days in advance about this weekend's training and sent out notices to alert people downtown.
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:23.020]  Watch those rooftops!
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:29.203]  The Military Operations Urban Training conducts mock gunfights and fires blank ammunition to train Marines.
[02:25:29.684 --> 02:25:34.526]  But Mayor spokesperson Brian Schwartz says Cardi doesn't want this done in downtown Toledo.
[02:25:35.087 --> 02:25:38.849]  His reasoning was for the good of the Toledo residents.
[02:25:39.109 --> 02:25:43.231]  But the majority of people interviewed today were appalled with the Mayor's actions.
[02:25:43.671 --> 02:25:44.732]  Well I'd be scared of the Marines.
[02:25:44.752 --> 02:25:47.393]  They protect your days, they protect your lives every day.
[02:25:48.274 --> 02:25:50.395]  I mean, look what they're doing over across seas.
[02:25:52.153 --> 02:25:55.954]  I was in the military and I know about special training and stuff.
[02:25:56.654 --> 02:26:03.276]  And the thing about that, the county should want that attention for Toledo to bring more attention to our city.
[02:26:03.396 --> 02:26:11.918]  Former Toledo Police Chief Jack Smith says when he was chief, the mayor asked him not to allow military trainings in Toledo and gave him no reason why.
[02:26:12.418 --> 02:26:14.179]  I strongly disagreed with that.
[02:26:14.199 --> 02:26:19.300]  He made a couple comments and the one that really set me off as a Marine myself was he didn't want the Marines
[02:26:20.171 --> 02:26:22.252]  Quote, playing war in Toledo anymore.
[02:26:22.932 --> 02:26:28.875]  And play is the farthest thing from your mind when you're prepping up to go into a combat situation like that.
[02:26:29.175 --> 02:26:37.699]  Jack Smith says he told the mayor that if one young Marine's life is saved because of the training he received in Toledo, then it's worth the minor inconvenience.
[02:26:38.239 --> 02:26:48.324]  The mayor needs to maybe forego one of his nonsensical bus rides through the city looking for spilled garbage cans and take a little walk around to that military memorial behind the safety building.
[02:26:48.891 --> 02:26:57.494]  And just reflect on those hundreds of names that made that sacrifice, and the sacrifice of these young kids that they're going to be making as they go into that kind of thing.
[02:26:57.554 --> 02:27:03.476]  And for him to take that training away from them that might possibly... So see, now he wants to hurt the dead in the memorial.
[02:27:03.556 --> 02:27:03.816]  See?
[02:27:04.156 --> 02:27:05.477]  Oh, now he's not for the troops.
[02:27:05.637 --> 02:27:06.817]  I've been to these.
[02:27:07.658 --> 02:27:10.619]  This is to train the public to accept martial law.
[02:27:11.379 --> 02:27:15.100]  Why did the police chief, Allie Philippus of San Antonio, kick him out in 99?
[02:27:15.420 --> 02:27:17.221]  Then they tried to bribe him, and that was the Army.
[02:27:18.121 --> 02:27:18.821]  I've been there.
[02:27:19.141 --> 02:27:20.202]  You've seen the footage.
[02:27:20.662 --> 02:27:22.423]  It's for domestic takeover.
[02:27:22.783 --> 02:27:25.304]  It's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[02:27:26.844 --> 02:27:27.364]  Period!
[02:27:27.945 --> 02:27:30.525]  And a bunch of those Marines are illegal aliens and felons.
[02:27:31.186 --> 02:27:31.866]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.508 --> 02:27:37.468]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.908 --> 02:27:39.509]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.429 --> 02:27:43.130]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.343 --> 02:27:46.983]  It's a fact.
[02:27:47.203 --> 02:27:54.684]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:27:54.805 --> 02:28:03.666]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:28:03.946 --> 02:28:14.468]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:28:14.748 --> 02:28:20.813]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:28:21.034 --> 02:28:26.058]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:28:26.238 --> 02:28:30.722]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[02:28:30.882 --> 02:28:32.684]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[02:28:32.704 --> 02:28:32.924]  That's 877-943-8600.

[02:30:07.229 --> 02:30:11.931]  Tastefully decorate your car and help promote Ron Paul's message of freedom and hope for America.
[02:30:12.131 --> 02:30:12.491]  I think so.
[02:30:37.150 --> 02:30:39.632]  Or call 941-993-3700.
[02:30:39.772 --> 02:30:42.835]  That's 941-993-3700.
[02:30:42.855 --> 02:30:45.577]  And let's take America back.
[02:30:52.122 --> 02:30:55.445]  A lot of strong medicine today.
[02:30:55.465 --> 02:30:57.827]  A lot of very serious topics being discussed.
[02:31:00.169 --> 02:31:02.831]  But if we don't expose this, if we don't expose their plans,
[02:31:06.707 --> 02:31:13.091]  If you don't realize what this dark shadow government has created, who runs it, they will certainly carry it out and they will get away with it.
[02:31:14.972 --> 02:31:16.433]  But they will be defeated in the end.
[02:31:16.453 --> 02:31:16.893]  Know that.
[02:31:16.993 --> 02:31:17.954]  Evil always falls.
[02:31:19.495 --> 02:31:21.616]  And they studied all the past dictators and tyrants.
[02:31:21.636 --> 02:31:32.302]  They wrote textbooks on it and they openly stated that they wanted a scientific dictatorship where they covered every angle of escape, where they did it incrementally so there was no way to even see what was happening.
[02:31:32.322 --> 02:31:33.523]  But we do know what's happening.
[02:31:35.251 --> 02:31:38.172]  Now, I have a friend who's pretty high level at the Austin Airport.
[02:31:38.192 --> 02:31:39.153]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:31:40.333 --> 02:31:42.014]  And one day he came into the TV studio.
[02:31:42.034 --> 02:31:50.358]  He has an entertainment show down there and he comes in and he goes, Alex, you know how they, this is like a year ago, you know how they banned any liquids on the plane?
[02:31:51.418 --> 02:31:59.241]  He said, I had to sit there with News 8 Austin while they literally interviewed more than 40 people.
[02:31:59.281 --> 02:32:00.182]  He said, I quit counting at 40.
[02:32:01.184 --> 02:32:06.046]  They lined up people going to the checkpoint and News 8 Austin was asking him, do you like the new security?
[02:32:06.386 --> 02:32:08.326]  He said 40 plus said it was stupid.
[02:32:08.826 --> 02:32:09.507]  They didn't like it.
[02:32:09.547 --> 02:32:10.167]  It was dumb.
[02:32:11.147 --> 02:32:12.127]  That it was a police state.
[02:32:12.167 --> 02:32:13.168]  Different answers like that.
[02:32:13.668 --> 02:32:17.089]  And he said they got to one old lady who said, I love it.
[02:32:17.129 --> 02:32:17.709]  This is great.
[02:32:17.749 --> 02:32:18.489]  This is wonderful.
[02:32:20.270 --> 02:32:24.171]  He said he knew that night it would be on and he knew it would be her he would see.
[02:32:25.472 --> 02:32:27.152]  And guess what came on that night?
[02:32:29.153 --> 02:32:29.373]  Her.
[02:32:30.948 --> 02:32:32.129]  Saying how much she loved it.
[02:32:32.729 --> 02:32:35.231]  And the news saying the majority of people loved it.
[02:32:35.331 --> 02:32:36.352]  Actually, that everyone loved it.
[02:32:36.912 --> 02:32:37.573]  Same thing there.
[02:32:37.593 --> 02:32:39.014]  They go show people going, I love it!
[02:32:39.034 --> 02:32:39.674]  This is great!
[02:32:39.694 --> 02:32:40.795]  The mayor is bad!
[02:32:40.815 --> 02:32:44.958]  I love the Marines, you know, shooting blanks and running around in downtown.
[02:32:46.239 --> 02:32:47.060]  On the rooftops.
[02:32:50.462 --> 02:32:51.543]  See how they frame it all?
[02:32:52.463 --> 02:32:54.203]  And he ought to look at the dead veterans.
[02:32:54.243 --> 02:32:56.364]  He ought to know what's saving the lives.
[02:32:56.384 --> 02:32:58.244]  They've got all those mock cities everywhere.
[02:32:58.624 --> 02:32:59.524]  And it is dual use.
[02:32:59.564 --> 02:33:00.625]  It is for Iraq as well.
[02:33:00.925 --> 02:33:04.385]  But the conditioning is for domestic operations.
[02:33:06.986 --> 02:33:16.147]  Now, here's a piece, and I've got so many pieces just like this, where the police are working with the military for martial law.
[02:33:16.467 --> 02:33:16.968]  Here it is.
[02:33:17.028 --> 02:33:19.308]  This is for you, the American people.
[02:33:20.274 --> 02:33:21.515]  Not for any real threats.
[02:33:21.555 --> 02:33:22.356]  You understand that?
[02:33:22.476 --> 02:33:22.997]  Here it is.
[02:33:25.980 --> 02:33:31.706]  Covering your hometown from newsrooms across the region, this is News 7 at 11.
[02:33:34.348 --> 02:33:40.855]  The scenario was a fake, but the pepper spray and billy clubs used to break up this riot were definitely real.
[02:33:42.037 --> 02:33:43.458]  Good evening, I'm Miranda Stephens.
[02:33:43.638 --> 02:33:49.801]  Whether it's terrorism, riots, or any major disaster, local agencies will be the first to respond.
[02:33:50.141 --> 02:33:54.784]  That's why Roanoke City wants its disaster training to be as real as possible.
[02:33:55.204 --> 02:33:56.524]  Jeremy Butterfield has more.
[02:34:00.707 --> 02:34:06.350]  It's supposed to look like a riot, and the scene at William Fleming High School had all the elements.
[02:34:06.850 --> 02:34:11.052]  I'm one of the rioters that the guard and the police force had to take down and arrest.
[02:34:11.756 --> 02:34:13.217]  And be it very successfully.
[02:34:14.397 --> 02:34:16.999]  In this scenario, everyone has a role to play.
[02:34:17.339 --> 02:34:28.244]  The riders were ready to fight back as Roanoke Police, Roanoke Fire, local National Guard troops, and members of the Virginia Defense Force secured perimeters and moved in to make the arrest.
[02:34:30.686 --> 02:34:35.390]  Prior to 9-11, these organizations couldn't communicate and did not work together.
[02:34:35.871 --> 02:34:38.253]  They worked to support each other, but not together.
[02:34:38.833 --> 02:34:46.140]  And with the recent events of the last three to five years, we've become very good at working together, which is very important.
[02:34:47.181 --> 02:34:49.223]  Of course, these weren't real rioters.
[02:34:49.523 --> 02:34:56.069]  The rebels in t-shirts were all members of one of the participating agencies, but you couldn't tell that during the exercise.
[02:34:56.480 --> 02:35:07.727]  If you weren't protected by an orange vest signifying you as an observer, you were in danger of being hit by eggs, bottles, billy clubs, or even the occasional well-placed round from a sniper.
[02:35:08.108 --> 02:35:11.930]  We try to make this very real, give a real feel to it.
[02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:19.054]  The fire department provided some live burning out here, so we had smoke, flames, objects being thrown, a lot of chaos.
[02:35:19.075 --> 02:35:19.535]  Stop right there!
[02:35:21.149 --> 02:35:26.872]  The fire department provided some live burning out here, making it more realistic.
[02:35:27.913 --> 02:35:32.056]  Just like in Road to Tyranny, I'm up in Belton, Texas, videotaping.
[02:35:32.136 --> 02:35:32.396]  U.S.
[02:35:32.476 --> 02:35:36.278]  Army walks right over with Marines and says, turn those cameras off.
[02:35:36.638 --> 02:35:39.240]  You're the ones that videotaped us last year on the highway.
[02:35:39.833 --> 02:35:55.062]  When they pulled over a bus, didn't tell them it was a grill for 12 plus hours, and had army team after army team in a secret project search everyone, and the FBI agent screwed up and gave us a restricted document about how they were secretly integrating with 77 counties.
[02:35:55.703 --> 02:35:58.825]  Secret operations against the American people.
[02:35:59.325 --> 02:36:01.246]  Now, same thing in Belton.
[02:36:01.266 --> 02:36:05.449]  They blew up two cars, the mayor got up and said, we've been hit by terrorists and hit hard.
[02:36:06.289 --> 02:36:07.430]  Locals were panicking.
[02:36:07.810 --> 02:36:08.611]  It's all on video.
[02:36:09.511 --> 02:36:20.329]  And then a day later in the newspaper, a huge, you know, long story in the very end paragraph, you know, Belton hit by terrorists was the headline, and in the very last paragraph they said, it was all just a drill.
[02:36:20.934 --> 02:36:25.057]  See, it's to create the psychological perception of terrorism being real.
[02:36:25.618 --> 02:36:36.006]  Since there's no real terrorism going on, unless they stage a big theatrical, like 9-11, an inaugural bombing, no doubt Hillary will have one, they have to create this illusion.
[02:36:36.466 --> 02:36:40.809]  And in Seattle and Chicago, they blow up buses, helicopters, troops.
[02:36:42.971 --> 02:36:45.193]  And this image is police riding citizens down.
[02:36:45.911 --> 02:36:54.461]  And then if they really want to go after you, when there's a real protest, they have cops dressed up like protesters to start fights with the cops, so the cops who are in on it can now attack the peaceful population.
[02:36:55.262 --> 02:36:57.085]  See, it's all over the place.
[02:36:57.145 --> 02:36:57.565]  Back to it.
[02:36:58.787 --> 02:37:03.813]  There's going to be a lot of chaos in a civil disturbance situation, and that's what we want to try to incorporate as much as possible.
[02:37:04.761 --> 02:37:06.402]  Teamwork plays a major role.
[02:37:06.722 --> 02:37:13.425]  Mountain Police had to coordinate with the fire department, while National Guard troops marched in formation toward the rioters.
[02:37:13.805 --> 02:37:19.027]  Without cooperation throughout all the agencies, the rioters would have quickly taken control.
[02:37:19.047 --> 02:37:21.268]  I think everybody learned a little bit.
[02:37:21.848 --> 02:37:25.850]  Mistakes are made, but we'd rather make those mistakes here than in a real situation.
[02:37:26.843 --> 02:37:36.828]  This was the fourth year the agencies have participated in this drill, and organizers say the old adage, practice makes perfect, certainly holds true in the face of disaster.
[02:37:37.309 --> 02:37:39.510]  Jeremy Butterfield, News 7, Roanoke.
[02:37:40.305 --> 02:37:42.046]  Well, I guess you can never be too prepared.
[02:37:42.066 --> 02:37:46.428]  Something we should all keep in mind this week as we prepare for more rain.
[02:37:46.448 --> 02:37:47.608]  Isn't that right, Brad?
[02:37:48.028 --> 02:37:50.669]  Now, see, in disasters, what happened?
[02:37:50.989 --> 02:37:57.992]  They held the food back for five days ahead of emergency management, followed orders while his mother died in a nursing home of no food and water.
[02:37:58.392 --> 02:38:00.433]  He cried about it on TV, but he followed orders.
[02:38:00.473 --> 02:38:01.033]  Mama died.
[02:38:01.874 --> 02:38:04.155]  And, uh, I mean, this is the type of thing they do.
[02:38:05.535 --> 02:38:09.777]  And this is merging the police and the military to deal with, quote, the American people.
[02:38:10.462 --> 02:38:14.165]  What is it they've got planned that they know is going to cause a coast-to-coast breakdown?
[02:38:16.327 --> 02:38:18.609]  Why have they put it in the official Army funding?
[02:38:19.029 --> 02:38:21.871]  Why has Congress not been allowed to see the plans?
[02:38:22.251 --> 02:38:23.793]  I thought that's the bosses.
[02:38:23.833 --> 02:38:24.813]  I thought we elected them.
[02:38:25.754 --> 02:38:26.675]  You see what's happening?
[02:38:28.016 --> 02:38:31.459]  This is the intelligence bureaucracy taking over America!
[02:38:32.740 --> 02:38:33.460]  They're doing it!
[02:38:34.321 --> 02:38:34.961]  It's happening!
[02:38:37.383 --> 02:38:38.484]  Now this is Georgia.
[02:38:38.544 --> 02:38:39.305]  This is Georgia
[02:38:40.370 --> 02:38:53.155]  One of the former satellites of Russia in Eastern Europe, and the same sound cannons that our police have been given, the same things we videotaped in 2004 in Martial Law, the film in New York.
[02:38:54.956 --> 02:38:56.997]  They practiced mass arrests with peaceful people.
[02:38:57.017 --> 02:38:57.417]  Why?
[02:38:57.657 --> 02:39:00.639]  They were practicing scooping up thousands of people and putting them in a camp.
[02:39:02.159 --> 02:39:05.961]  Now this is the same thing in Georgia, and they say the US is advising Georgia.
[02:39:06.559 --> 02:39:07.159]  The U.S.
[02:39:07.219 --> 02:39:10.820]  went there and trained them, and then used it as a laboratory.
[02:39:13.461 --> 02:39:15.521]  And now Georgia's taking its people's liberties.
[02:39:16.721 --> 02:39:18.762]  Instead of being communists, they're becoming fascists.
[02:39:19.222 --> 02:39:20.262]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:39:26.363 --> 02:39:33.125]  On Wednesday, the world witnessed violent clashes in Belize, which sparked much condemnation for the grueling methods used by the police.
[02:39:34.639 --> 02:39:39.302]  Georgian policemen and special forces were cruelly beating protesters with fists and batons.
[02:39:39.643 --> 02:39:42.725]  At the receiving end of the blows were mostly unarmed people.
[02:39:47.729 --> 02:39:50.811]  But it was also a display of power of a different kind.
[02:39:51.171 --> 02:39:56.295]  Georgian special forces unveiled their high-tech equipment and used it to disperse the crowds.
[02:39:56.795 --> 02:39:59.798]  Sometimes it all looked like a scene from a science fiction movie.
[02:40:00.298 --> 02:40:02.980]  Special units clad in state-of-the-art gas masks
[02:40:03.379 --> 02:40:04.900]  ...moved in to pounce on the crowd.
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:08.542]  Demonstrators were first occupied by special water cannon.
[02:40:13.805 --> 02:40:16.847]  Tear gas and rubber bullets were used in the skirmishes shortly.
[02:40:17.287 --> 02:40:20.169]  Police fired at the crowd from expensive non-lethal weapons.
[02:40:20.509 --> 02:40:22.490]  Belgium produced FN riot guns.
[02:40:26.252 --> 02:40:28.573]  But it was not only about water, gas and bullets.
[02:40:29.133 --> 02:40:33.574]  Georgian police also used a unique ultrasound machine which disoriented people.
[02:40:40.335 --> 02:40:42.356]  Georgian police used an acoustic gun.
[02:40:42.756 --> 02:40:46.157]  It's a non-lethal weapon that disorients people for a period of time.
[02:40:46.677 --> 02:40:52.698]  Also police used so-called steam bombs and rubber bullets that can cause very serious damage.
[02:40:53.158 --> 02:40:55.679]  These are inhumane means of crowd control.
[02:40:56.260 --> 02:40:59.462]  Whoever ordered using them should be held responsible.
[02:40:59.842 --> 02:41:03.503]  A democratic country could never use them against peaceful demonstrators.
[02:41:04.464 --> 02:41:08.646]  It was one of the first times that this kind of acoustic gun was used to disperse crowds.
[02:41:09.046 --> 02:41:11.867]  Similar such guns are also owned by the Iraqi police.
[02:41:12.388 --> 02:41:19.311]  The steps used in Tbilisi on Wednesday suggest that Georgian special forces were prepared and equipped with a group of foreign allies.
[02:41:23.466 --> 02:41:24.426]  It's due to the U.S.
[02:41:24.486 --> 02:41:28.828]  training program given to Georgian riot police that they managed to do what they did.
[02:41:29.388 --> 02:41:34.030]  This year, Georgia received over $10 million, more than any other CIS state.
[02:41:34.491 --> 02:41:39.693]  Georgian police applied modern anti-riot machines and up-to-date methods of fighting demonstrators.
[02:41:41.054 --> 02:41:48.657]  The Georgian opposition was preparing protests in Tbilisi for a few months, but Wednesday showed that Georgian authorities were ready to strike back.
[02:41:54.349 --> 02:41:56.590]  There you go, and it's all a laboratory.
[02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:58.490]  Now what did we catch him in 99 doing?
[02:41:58.650 --> 02:42:03.892]  Delta Force commanded the operation according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the Seattle Times.
[02:42:04.032 --> 02:42:04.572]  Both reported.
[02:42:04.592 --> 02:42:07.152]  It's in my film, Police State to the Takeover.
[02:42:07.813 --> 02:42:08.693]  They have 60,000 peaceful people.
[02:42:10.545 --> 02:42:14.367]  The feds brought in 50 individuals led by U.S.
[02:42:14.507 --> 02:42:16.648]  Army dressed up like anarchists.
[02:42:17.148 --> 02:42:18.109]  They attacked police.
[02:42:18.149 --> 02:42:21.150]  The police were ordered to stand down and those images were used nationwide.
[02:42:21.850 --> 02:42:29.854]  Then the 50 hired thugs were sequestered to a government building under government protection right next door to the police station all on video.
[02:42:30.634 --> 02:42:31.555]  Cops even spoke out.
[02:42:32.188 --> 02:42:35.932]  But the police were then ordered to savagely attack the peaceful demonstrators.
[02:42:36.293 --> 02:42:37.354]  They went into neighborhoods.
[02:42:37.394 --> 02:42:42.900]  They went into, and we have them on tape, beating old women with billy clubs and breaking their collarbones.
[02:42:44.722 --> 02:42:46.824]  And then they just got caught last year.
[02:42:47.445 --> 02:42:54.092]  Finally, where they admitted they did it, cops dressed up like anarchists starting fights to go after the predominantly middle-aged crowd.
[02:42:56.736 --> 02:42:57.697]  You are the enemy.
[02:42:58.257 --> 02:43:02.859]  All the tax money you pay, everything that's been built, is for you.
[02:43:03.879 --> 02:43:17.146]  And of course there's this newscast, in case any of you doubt, a year plus, this is big news, a year plus after we broke it here on the network, after we got you the secret documents of how they recruited 13,000 preachers, they doubled it to 26,000.
[02:43:17.566 --> 02:43:18.386]  And that was last year.
[02:43:18.406 --> 02:43:19.467]  They plan to double it again to 52,000. 52,000.
[02:43:24.702 --> 02:43:33.069]  Thousand preachers already giving sermons about submitting to this and handing in your guns, and when it all comes down, they're going to be there running it.
[02:43:34.390 --> 02:43:39.995]  Just like in Red Dawn, how they hire the preacher and they hire the mayor.
[02:43:40.055 --> 02:43:45.359]  They're going to keep all the same faces there for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:45.740 --> 02:43:46.220]  This is it.
[02:43:47.193 --> 02:43:48.854]  We built the military-industrial complex.
[02:43:48.874 --> 02:43:52.157]  It's what always happens in third world countries, is the military just takes over.
[02:43:52.457 --> 02:43:54.518]  Now the private banks that own our military are doing it here.
[02:43:55.639 --> 02:43:57.741]  Here's the gun confiscation piece for you one more time.
[02:43:58.421 --> 02:44:00.903]  Law ever become a reality in America?
[02:44:01.283 --> 02:44:05.626]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S.
[02:44:05.666 --> 02:44:07.748]  territory might trigger just that.
[02:44:08.228 --> 02:44:15.113]  NFKHL News 12's Jeff Beryl discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[02:44:16.118 --> 02:44:19.020]  From my cold, dead hand!
[02:44:48.092 --> 02:44:55.237]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[02:44:55.718 --> 02:45:00.861]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[02:45:01.362 --> 02:45:07.967]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's go out there and get this thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[02:45:08.207 --> 02:45:14.111]  Such Clergy Response Teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus the wishes of the public.
[02:45:14.572 --> 02:45:16.333]  In a lot of cases... Let's stop right there.
[02:45:17.518 --> 02:45:32.621]  Now notice the last 10 years, the police of course are civilians, they're not in the military, but now we're called civilians, the mayor calls us civilians in every major city and town, and then now it's the needs of the government versus the wishes.
[02:45:32.801 --> 02:45:35.321]  Oh, we run everything, but you can have your wishes.
[02:45:39.062 --> 02:45:40.082]  This is martial law.
[02:45:42.163 --> 02:45:43.023]  This is martial law.
[02:45:44.548 --> 02:45:46.249]  And we're incrementally going into it.
[02:45:46.289 --> 02:45:49.752]  This doesn't have to happen if we get the word out now.
[02:45:50.313 --> 02:45:55.957]  See, we don't need to whine about Ron Paul and his campaign not getting very many delegates.
[02:45:56.878 --> 02:46:02.523]  We don't need to whine about, you know, which talk show host does the best job or which Patriot group you like.
[02:46:02.583 --> 02:46:04.024]  Look, it's all about the New World Order.
[02:46:04.064 --> 02:46:04.965]  It's about fighting them.
[02:46:06.386 --> 02:46:09.068]  It's about exposing what they're doing.
[02:46:09.888 --> 02:46:14.152]  It's about pulling out all the stops and not wasting any more time.
[02:46:15.996 --> 02:46:18.176]  We have got to warn the people now.
[02:46:18.256 --> 02:46:19.697]  We have got to speak out now.
[02:46:19.757 --> 02:46:22.077]  Prominent people have to speak out now.
[02:46:22.537 --> 02:46:25.478]  Now is the time to do everything you can.
[02:46:25.498 --> 02:46:31.319]  I mean, why do you think Willie Nelson contacted us and wanted to come on the show and tell you about martial law?
[02:46:31.799 --> 02:46:33.139]  And tell you about how he's worried about it?
[02:46:34.199 --> 02:46:34.619]  He knows.
[02:46:35.519 --> 02:46:37.020]  Anybody who researches this knows.
[02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:40.480]  We need more prominent people because it gets attention when they go public.
[02:46:42.801 --> 02:46:43.481]  Heaven help us.
[02:46:43.501 --> 02:46:44.021]  I mean, listen.
[02:46:45.052 --> 02:46:46.914]  I can't enjoy thinking about a vacation.
[02:46:46.934 --> 02:46:49.276]  I can't enjoy thinking about having fun or going to a movie.
[02:46:49.836 --> 02:46:54.100]  I can't think about anything but this because it's creeping death all around us.
[02:47:01.426 --> 02:47:02.447]  I need all of you.
[02:47:04.669 --> 02:47:06.690]  We need to use the internet while we've still got it.
[02:47:07.611 --> 02:47:12.215]  I need all of you to go get Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement for free off of Google Video.
[02:47:13.476 --> 02:47:15.958]  And I need you to make it number one on Google Video.
[02:47:15.978 --> 02:47:17.219]  I need you to get that link.
[02:47:18.019 --> 02:47:19.700]  Type in-game Alex Jones into Google.
[02:47:20.161 --> 02:47:21.341]  Get the top video link.
[02:47:21.902 --> 02:47:23.042]  It's always in the top ten now.
[02:47:23.523 --> 02:47:24.964]  And I need you to email it to everybody.
[02:47:24.984 --> 02:47:27.145]  I need you to go on message boards, Sean Hannity's.
[02:47:27.565 --> 02:47:30.087]  I need you to go on ABC, CNN's message boards.
[02:47:30.107 --> 02:47:33.189]  I need you to go on all the so-called alternative sites.
[02:47:33.249 --> 02:47:43.116]  We need to get all the Ron Paul supporters, who a lot of them are babies to these things, who are just now waking up, you know, to realize the next hardcore level of this.
[02:47:44.113 --> 02:47:45.554]  We need to stop mincing words.
[02:47:45.594 --> 02:47:47.116]  We need to stop self-censoring.
[02:47:47.436 --> 02:47:49.337]  We need to get serious, or there's no future.
[02:47:49.357 --> 02:47:52.360]  Look, I could care less about you buying the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:58.045]  Yeah, that funds us and lets us operate, and it's good to have the high-quality DVD to show people it looks a lot better than Google Video, whatever.
[02:47:58.805 --> 02:48:05.091]  But go to PrisonPlanet.tv, get a 15-cent-a-day membership, and get a higher-quality web version, and get it out to people.
[02:48:06.172 --> 02:48:07.573]  Just whatever you do, don't wait.
[02:48:07.653 --> 02:48:09.915]  Don't wait past this evening to start making copies.
[02:48:09.955 --> 02:48:12.417]  Don't wait past tomorrow to start giving them to people.
[02:48:13.524 --> 02:48:16.005]  Don't wait to email your whole email list of friends.
[02:48:16.685 --> 02:48:18.245]  Don't wait to tell your co-workers.
[02:48:18.285 --> 02:48:20.066]  Don't wait to warn people.
[02:48:21.246 --> 02:48:23.927]  Now, I want the New World Order to know I've analyzed their police state grid.
[02:48:23.947 --> 02:48:25.487]  I think it's going to fall apart when they try it.
[02:48:25.828 --> 02:48:30.909]  Unless it is something like a biological attack where they can pose as the saviors and people are so afraid they'll line up.
[02:48:32.449 --> 02:48:33.610]  You're going to see horrible stuff.
[02:48:34.770 --> 02:48:35.750]  Unless we back them off.
[02:48:35.810 --> 02:48:37.351]  Unless we expose that they're behind it.
[02:48:37.791 --> 02:48:40.052]  If we don't expose government-sponsored terror, they're going to launch it.
[02:48:40.512 --> 02:48:41.552]  Final segment, stay with me.
[02:48:46.802 --> 02:48:48.203]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.223 --> 02:48:50.324]  A new world order.
[02:48:51.045 --> 02:48:55.267]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:55.907 --> 02:48:58.709]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:58.769 --> 02:49:00.990]  Both their objective being world domination.
[02:49:01.551 --> 02:49:04.012]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.733 --> 02:49:12.057]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:20.062]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.562 --> 02:49:24.004]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.384 --> 02:49:26.885]  Bill of Rights makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:26.945 --> 02:49:28.086]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:28.106 --> 02:49:28.886]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.906 --> 02:49:29.966]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.186 --> 02:49:30.907]  They're after power.
[02:49:31.167 --> 02:49:32.287]  That's what they're after, usually.
[02:49:32.307 --> 02:49:36.849]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:49:37.069 --> 02:49:40.511]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:40.991 --> 02:49:41.751]  Endgame.
[02:49:41.791 --> 02:49:43.372]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.833 --> 02:49:44.919]  You have been warned.
[02:49:46.391 --> 02:49:50.094]  This is George Winters-Ferry of the Genesis Communications Network.
[02:49:50.334 --> 02:49:52.616]  Have you ever wanted the truth about the economy?
[02:49:52.917 --> 02:49:53.377]  Crash!
[02:49:53.637 --> 02:49:54.358]  Are You Ready?
[02:49:54.798 --> 02:49:57.661]  is the fastest-growing program on GCN.
[02:49:57.981 --> 02:50:02.965]  Our one-hour program airs weekdays Monday through Friday from 10 to 11 a.m.
[02:50:03.185 --> 02:50:07.789]  Central Time, just after the Power Hour and just before Alex Jones.
[02:50:08.209 --> 02:50:14.675]  To listen to rebroadcast 24 and 7, visit our website at www.gcnet.com.
[02:50:14.795 --> 02:50:15.235]  We're good to go.
[02:50:35.931 --> 02:50:39.434]  Go to www.hearonline.com.
[02:50:39.814 --> 02:50:45.138]  That's H-E-A-R-I-T-O-N-L-I-N-E dot com.
[02:50:45.838 --> 02:50:51.482]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[02:50:51.682 --> 02:50:56.826]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:50:57.106 --> 02:51:02.189]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:51:02.490 --> 02:51:04.251]  People who alkalize the water they drink
[02:51:04.491 --> 02:51:08.054]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:51:08.374 --> 02:51:14.379]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[02:51:14.619 --> 02:51:18.142]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:51:18.402 --> 02:51:22.946]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:51:23.226 --> 02:51:24.007]  Do your part.
[02:51:24.267 --> 02:51:26.529]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[02:51:26.889 --> 02:51:33.014]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[02:51:33.234 --> 02:51:35.235]  Well, you were sleeping They came and took it all away
[02:52:05.477 --> 02:52:14.882]  We discussed some of the most hardcore issues in the last three hours.
[02:52:14.942 --> 02:52:19.004]  If you missed any of it, we'll restream it starting in about five minutes at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:19.945 --> 02:52:20.885]  The stream's right there.
[02:52:20.905 --> 02:52:22.786]  If you miss seeing the show, you can go back right when it ends.
[02:52:22.826 --> 02:52:24.788]  The show restarts at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:27.089 --> 02:52:32.452]  I didn't get into all the news about her turning power off in California for times, in England,
[02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:39.364]  Australia, just to train you and habitualize you to accept the government restricting your resources in the name of saving the Earth.
[02:52:40.344 --> 02:52:44.047]  Regardless of what you think about global warming, they're using it to get taxes and control in.
[02:52:44.087 --> 02:52:45.227]  I had all that in a stack.
[02:52:46.128 --> 02:52:47.709]  That's another prong of this control.
[02:52:50.350 --> 02:52:51.571]  Chris and Matt, you're on the air.
[02:52:51.611 --> 02:52:51.951]  Go ahead.
[02:52:54.433 --> 02:52:55.714]  Go ahead, Chris, you're on the air.
[02:52:56.014 --> 02:53:00.016]  I've been a listener for about a year now since your last birthday, so happy birthday.
[02:53:00.256 --> 02:53:00.537]  Thank you.
[02:53:01.778 --> 02:53:30.456]  I just want to share that, you know, I'm not as active as all the amazing people that are on your show, but God, so much came out today and I think this is, you know, Ron Paul sent maybe one press release out, but we're all still out here and, you know, he's going to be in this debate and candidates for president are going to have to campaign with a country that has these videos on YouTube and I know, you know, these things are going to be in the public
[02:53:34.698 --> 02:53:36.478]  I mean, this isn't the end.
[02:53:36.558 --> 02:53:36.999]  That's right.
[02:53:37.099 --> 02:53:43.480]  Relics and monuments of the Ron Paul revolution that continues will just be scattered throughout the cyberspace forever.
[02:53:43.500 --> 02:53:46.861]  All right, Alex.
[02:53:46.901 --> 02:53:47.761]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:53:47.962 --> 02:53:48.422]  Thank you.
[02:53:48.542 --> 02:53:50.642]  Will in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:53:53.003 --> 02:53:54.023]  Okay, Michael, go ahead.
[02:53:54.623 --> 02:53:55.003]  Hello.
[02:53:55.223 --> 02:53:55.444]  Hi.
[02:53:57.464 --> 02:53:58.964]  I had a couple things I wanted to talk about.
[02:53:58.984 --> 02:54:00.745]  I wanted to talk about Ron Paul a little bit.
[02:54:01.754 --> 02:54:03.375]  I'm a potential delegate for Ron Paul.
[02:54:03.635 --> 02:54:05.916]  I haven't made it to the next level of the caucus yet.
[02:54:06.496 --> 02:54:11.678]  But I was wondering what your thoughts were on those people out there that are delegates.
[02:54:13.119 --> 02:54:13.739]  What should they do?
[02:54:13.799 --> 02:54:14.960]  Should they continue on?
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:16.380]  Yeah, they should continue on.
[02:54:16.600 --> 02:54:18.261]  I mean, to educate people in the process.
[02:54:18.281 --> 02:54:19.962]  It's just that there's not going to be a Broker Convention.
[02:54:21.202 --> 02:54:21.502]  Okay.
[02:54:22.063 --> 02:54:26.584]  And also, I think I kind of agree with you a little bit about a third-party run.
[02:54:27.105 --> 02:54:28.845]  And I kind of ask myself these questions.
[02:54:28.865 --> 02:54:30.366]  You know, what's going on with the Ron Pauls?
[02:54:30.831 --> 02:54:38.554]  Kind of disheartened me a little bit, but I think Ron Paul running as a third-party delegate, I think, would carry the message a lot farther.
[02:54:38.574 --> 02:54:42.775]  I know, but then he'll be thrown out of the Republican Party and probably lose his House seat.
[02:54:43.595 --> 02:54:43.836]  True.
[02:54:44.256 --> 02:54:55.540]  The thing I think, though, is, you know, if you're Ron Paul, you're 72 years old, you know, you've been involved with politics for a long time, 10-term congressman, and, you know, when is the right time?
[02:54:55.580 --> 02:54:59.601]  Is that really the right thing, to go back and defend your congressional seat?
[02:55:00.294 --> 02:55:02.135]  Or is now the time to really go for Brock?
[02:55:02.175 --> 02:55:04.656]  I mean, I guess that's the way I look at it.
[02:55:04.676 --> 02:55:07.457]  I understand why he'd want to defend his congressional seat.
[02:55:07.477 --> 02:55:12.740]  We're going to be getting the campaign on in the next few days, and we'll get some answer from him on that.
[02:55:13.220 --> 02:55:13.760]  I hear you.
[02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:15.861]  Steve in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:55:15.881 --> 02:55:16.261]  Go ahead.
[02:55:17.462 --> 02:55:18.482]  Hey, how you doing, man?
[02:55:18.502 --> 02:55:18.722]  Good.
[02:55:19.583 --> 02:55:20.563]  Right on.
[02:55:21.103 --> 02:55:27.206]  Dude, I've checked out some of your stuff before, and amazing stuff, the Bohemian Girls video.
[02:55:28.327 --> 02:55:32.150]  I gotta tell you, some of this stuff is just so crazy.
[02:55:32.210 --> 02:55:33.471]  It's like, wow.
[02:55:34.251 --> 02:55:36.693]  But everything I checked out, it checks out.
[02:55:37.753 --> 02:55:41.135]  Yeah, like I've been saying for five years, you'd hear Rush Limbaugh and Doris Hillary Clinton.
[02:55:41.256 --> 02:55:41.756]  Did it happen?
[02:55:41.776 --> 02:55:43.177]  Uh-huh.
[02:55:44.237 --> 02:55:46.899]  Look, I know what their attack plan is, and I'm out of time.
[02:55:46.939 --> 02:55:47.700]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:49.541]  Sorry, everybody else that's holding.
[02:55:50.592 --> 02:55:52.233]  Look, I wish none of this was true.
[02:55:52.293 --> 02:55:58.715]  I'm so freaked out today on this show that I haven't even plugged my sponsors, and I haven't even plugged my videos, okay?
[02:55:58.755 --> 02:56:04.798]  I mean, look, it's just really hitting home for me that the enemy is not going to stop until we stop them.
[02:56:06.318 --> 02:56:09.099]  So, Ron Paul isn't even in this equation, okay?
[02:56:09.139 --> 02:56:11.420]  We support him, fine, we move on.
[02:56:11.460 --> 02:56:12.421]  The enemy's still there.
[02:56:12.481 --> 02:56:13.761]  The enemy is still attacking.
[02:56:15.302 --> 02:56:15.622]  Okay?
[02:56:17.253 --> 02:56:18.154]  Engage the enemy.
[02:56:18.194 --> 02:56:18.874]  Go wild.
[02:56:18.934 --> 02:56:19.595]  Get the word out.
[02:56:19.635 --> 02:56:20.395]  Any way you can.
[02:56:20.535 --> 02:56:21.536]  Use your inventiveness.
