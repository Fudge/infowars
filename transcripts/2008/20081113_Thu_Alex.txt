[00:00:11.357 --> 00:00:15.079]  Bob Chapman with us with his once-a-week visit, The International Forecaster.
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.182]  A jam-packed fourth hour today.
[00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:21.004]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:22.745]  We've got a lot of audio clips I want to play.
[00:00:23.645 --> 00:00:25.647]  I have your calls to take.
[00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:30.886]  Before Bob Chapman on the economy or any other issue, he can speak to it and a lot of news to cover.
[00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:38.228]  City Council of Detroit wants a $10 billion bailout from the federal government, i.e.
[00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:41.309]  taxpayer money given to them that we have to pay back.
[00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.931]  Ford and GM want $50 billion.
[00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:49.492]  GE wins FDIC insurance for up to $139 billion in debt.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.782]  So their stock plunged.
[00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:57.206]  Walmart, though, is the only group out there posting a profit.
[00:00:58.493 --> 00:00:59.393]  Because they're predatory.
[00:00:59.453 --> 00:01:07.035]  They have the slave systems, they have the slave camps, they have the factory deals, they have the inside deal, the inside track.
[00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:09.775]  They are meant to de-industrialize the United States.
[00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:17.396]  They are part of the globalist military attack through the financial system, or this financial siege, this financial genocide.
[00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:26.118]  So, Walmart post higher third quarter profits because they will cut prices to below what it's even costing them to savage everyone else.
[00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:33.361]  So again, the parasitic system, they only get more powerful as the host begins to die.
[00:01:34.902 --> 00:01:38.444]  Bailouts lack oversight, despite billions pledged.
[00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:40.485]  That's a whitewash itself.
[00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.186]  Watchdog panel is empty.
[00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:43.266]  Report is unfinished.
[00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:48.269]  It says six weeks since lawmakers approved the Treasury's massive bailout.
[00:01:49.172 --> 00:01:49.813]  That's actually wrong.
[00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:51.055]  It's been five weeks, but whatever.
[00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:54.580]  And then they go into whitewashing things saying it's $700 billion.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.122]  It's $5 trillion!
[00:01:57.113 --> 00:01:57.793]  Five trillion!
[00:01:57.873 --> 00:01:58.934]  That's an AP in Bloomberg.
[00:01:59.314 --> 00:02:01.375]  And they've already stolen that two trillion.
[00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:03.076]  They won't even say where it went.
[00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:07.099]  Bonner demands Fed identify recipients of loans.
[00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:09.780]  Talked to Bob Chapman about this first when we come back out of the break.
[00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:18.765]  House Republican John Bonner called for the Federal Reserve to disclose the recipients of two trillion of emergency loans.
[00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:20.406]  And they said no.
[00:02:20.647 --> 00:02:22.588]  And they issued blacked out pages.
[00:02:23.028 --> 00:02:24.609]  And then Treasury Secretary
[00:02:25.902 --> 00:02:41.497]  and fed chairman get up on TV and say we've given you total transparency the taxpayers are protected and then Greenspan goes on Learners Hour Monday and says we are above the law, we are above everyone, no one can even investigate us.
[00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:46.369]  Another one here out of the Washington Post, Bush out of office could oppose inquiries.
[00:02:47.250 --> 00:03:04.085]  CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, they're all putting out the disinfo that, oh, Bush is expanding Patriot 2 before he leaves, non-legislatively, and it says that police can be federalized and spy on anyone for even non-political reasons or non-criminal reasons.
[00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:05.066]  Just total tyranny.
[00:03:06.087 --> 00:03:08.889]  Which is what Obama wants, the million-man domestic spy force.
[00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.351]  And it said Obama can't reverse it if Bush does it.
[00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:13.752]  Total lie.
[00:03:14.273 --> 00:03:16.034]  Obama could instantly reverse it.
[00:03:16.614 --> 00:03:19.957]  But see, they're already telling you, Obama can't change what Bush did.
[00:03:20.477 --> 00:03:25.060]  Knowing the public, doesn't even know, over a fifth of Americans can't find the U.S.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.461]  on a map.
[00:03:26.317 --> 00:03:26.637]  Okay.
[00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:30.621]  Eighty-something percent in a big study I saw didn't know who the Vice President was.
[00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:36.426]  So, they're telling you, and they tell you in the New York Times, Congress can't subpoena the President.
[00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:38.127]  The President's above Congress.
[00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:38.427]  Really?
[00:03:38.788 --> 00:03:41.210]  How come they have to approve all of his cabinet?
[00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.192]  The House and the Senate are above the President.
[00:03:45.232 --> 00:03:46.152]  They're not co-equal.
[00:03:46.813 --> 00:03:48.975]  That's why legislatures used to send the Senators.
[00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:55.100]  Because the Founders knew you had to have the real power in the legislature because it had more checks and balances.
[00:03:55.501 --> 00:04:01.706]  But now the New York Times comes out and tells you, hey, there's nothing you can do.
[00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:06.531]  And puts out this disinformation that there's no oversight.
[00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:08.813]  Just like Alan Greenspan says, there's no oversight.
[00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:10.657]  Since when?
[00:04:11.358 --> 00:04:14.461]  And the public isn't buying it, but still the globalists don't care.
[00:04:14.481 --> 00:04:16.202]  So we're going to come back and talk to Bob Chapman right now.
[00:04:16.682 --> 00:04:18.604]  Suicide attack kills 10 Afghans, U.S.
[00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:20.165]  soldiers and officials.
[00:04:20.746 --> 00:04:22.007]  Paranoia on the rise.
[00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:29.213]  Las Vegas Sun is reporting that experts say that, and it says paranoia about the New World Order.
[00:04:30.094 --> 00:04:31.254]  Oh, you believe there's a New World Order?
[00:04:31.274 --> 00:04:32.035]  You're crazy.
[00:04:32.095 --> 00:04:35.258]  Oh, it's just all over TV and radio.
[00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:40.129]  Also, they've announced statewide warrantless checkpoints in Texas.
[00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.690]  They spun it in the media that's for illegal aliens.
[00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.311]  You read the fine print, the illegal aliens are above the law.
[00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:46.432]  They're to be released.
[00:04:46.472 --> 00:04:47.552]  This is for citizens.
[00:04:49.093 --> 00:04:55.415]  So, that's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, with Bob Chapman, your phone calls, and a lot more on the other side of this break.
[00:04:55.975 --> 00:04:58.556]  In fact, for PrisonPlanet.tv members, I'm going to go ahead and talk to Bob.
[00:04:59.817 --> 00:05:01.578]  Let me go ahead and talk to Bob right now.
[00:05:01.598 --> 00:05:01.758]  Bob?
[00:05:03.234 --> 00:05:03.715]  Yes.
[00:05:04.496 --> 00:05:15.314]  We're going to come back and let's just rapid fire get your comments on each one of these points I just raised, then get into where the economy is going right now, how they're still hammering gold, and then take a lot of calls for you, okay?
[00:05:16.296 --> 00:05:16.576]  Okay.
[00:05:17.247 --> 00:05:22.829]  And I've got some other interesting audio clips I'm going to be playing today, so it'll be a jam-packed time that's coming up.
[00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:33.453]  We're just on the internet right now, but that's millions in the aggregate, but hundreds of thousands listening right now to the podcast and on the streams, and thousands watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:42.197]  In the two minutes we've got before we come back, give the folks watching a preview of some of the things you want to talk about, what you think is most important right now.
[00:05:43.612 --> 00:05:50.914]  Well, I think the change of pace by the Secretary of the Treasury, they've been at it for 15 months and they still don't know where they're going.
[00:05:51.534 --> 00:05:53.595]  Everything they've tried has been unsuccessful.
[00:05:54.135 --> 00:06:07.259]  And as you pointed out, all their sweetheart deals that they've been giving to their other aluminous friends, they won't even tell you who they're giving the money to, which is the height of arrogance.
[00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:10.900]  And the situation in the market,
[00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:23.625]  Market was down $300, announcement came out, President's going to speak, the market goes down to even, and then he speaks and the market goes back up $250, and now it's come back down again.
[00:06:24.165 --> 00:06:31.087]  And so every time the Plunge Protection Team runs the market up, institutions, the public, come in and sell.
[00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:35.088]  So the market's not going anywhere, and eventually it's going to go lower.
[00:06:35.908 --> 00:06:37.389]  Gold just rallied $12, actually about
[00:06:39.688 --> 00:06:43.609]  About $18, and now it's way back to even again.
[00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:45.289]  It's like a circus.
[00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:47.390]  All of this says total manipulation.
[00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.510]  Total.
[00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.811]  And it's not only these markets, it's all over the world.
[00:06:52.651 --> 00:06:57.072]  And, you know, you get this meeting coming up in a couple of days, and what are they going to do?
[00:06:57.092 --> 00:07:07.315]  They're going to tell the world that they're going to print money and credit every country, as fast as humanly possible, and that
[00:07:08.534 --> 00:07:14.658]  They're going to, as well, all bring their interest rates to zero.
[00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:22.602]  And that'll probably buy them about two years, and then they'll get into the Japanese Syndrome, and they'll all go down together.
[00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:38.073]  But not before the elites have tried to position themselves in a safe position and set up a police state as a rearguard action against us as they leave scorched earth so we're too busy trying to feed ourselves to ever go after them.
[00:07:38.973 --> 00:07:40.234]  And that's why it's so important.
[00:07:40.274 --> 00:07:43.836]  Everybody should have food, a filter, and weapons at home.
[00:07:44.617 --> 00:07:47.599]  It's a primary objective of every one of you out there.
[00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:56.124]  All right, let's come in with Bob Chapman of InternationalForecaster.com for the full AM and FM satellite shortwave audience in T-minus three seconds.
[00:07:56.164 --> 00:07:56.624]  Here we go.
[00:07:59.466 --> 00:08:05.089]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:11.693]  All right, Bob Chapman with us for 52 minutes today and your phone calls, some other audio clips I want to play.
[00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:17.729]  We've got Salente predicts revolution, food riots, tax rebellions by 2012.
[00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:22.090]  Trends Research Institute.
[00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.271]  He's just like Bob.
[00:08:23.311 --> 00:08:26.233]  His predictions are about 95% accuracy.
[00:08:26.733 --> 00:08:31.977]  When CNN wants to know about top trends, we ask Gerald Salente.
[00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:36.019]  But the problem is that they wouldn't have him on years ago when he was saying this.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.761]  Now they want him on to fully panic people.
[00:08:39.402 --> 00:08:40.863]  Now they want to route things.
[00:08:41.423 --> 00:08:43.224]  So we've got Bob Chapman on with us.
[00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:45.046]  Our financial expert who joins us once a week.
[00:08:46.243 --> 00:08:48.666]  To go over what's happening with the markets right now.
[00:08:49.346 --> 00:09:02.801]  Bob, first off, they're telling us Bretton Woods 2, they're openly announcing that they want a quote, new world order run by the banks where they set commodity prices, where they set and globally rig stock markets publicly, what they're already doing.
[00:09:03.402 --> 00:09:03.722]  I think?
[00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:27.915]  They say out of this meeting this weekend, they'll have a string of others over the next year.
[00:09:28.215 --> 00:09:37.298]  They're going to use the crisis to force us onto the system, break down what we're going to see this weekend and what you think they'll be able to set up and then how you see that unfolding.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.181]  He says the same thing that you're saying.
[00:09:42.561 --> 00:09:54.086]  He says by 2012 it will be war in the streets, literally Mad Max beyond Thunderdome, and he's saying that the bankers did it basically by design.
[00:09:54.446 --> 00:09:58.048]  He says we've had a bloodless coup with Wall Street taking over the U.S.
[00:09:58.268 --> 00:09:58.928]  and looting.
[00:09:59.569 --> 00:10:02.090]  And they're letting him say this on mainstream TV.
[00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:05.431]  Bob Chapman.
[00:10:05.931 --> 00:10:09.613]  They like him more than they like me because they won't invite me on mainstream.
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.761]  TV, they tell me I was a street fighter last time.
[00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:15.962]  And that's probably very true.
[00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:19.303]  I did grow up on the streets and I was a street fighter.
[00:10:20.003 --> 00:10:21.723]  But that was a long time ago.
[00:10:22.504 --> 00:10:25.644]  Out of the meeting, what they're going to get is zero interest rates.
[00:10:25.704 --> 00:10:26.765]  Everybody's going to do that.
[00:10:27.145 --> 00:10:28.105]  All the central banks.
[00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:31.546]  And they will print money and credit until the cows come home.
[00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:33.807]  And so what are we going to have?
[00:10:33.827 --> 00:10:38.108]  We're going to have hyperinflation to offset the underlying deflation that we're in.
[00:10:38.735 --> 00:10:44.580]  We're having a small hiatus now for 3-4 months, where inflation will back off a little bit.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:52.626]  Don't be fooled out there, because it's coming back with a vengeance, the monetization of these trillions of dollars that are being created.
[00:10:53.326 --> 00:10:54.867]  And so, that's where we're headed.
[00:10:54.887 --> 00:11:08.378]  I think as time goes on and the market goes lower, which I believe it will, that what we will have is continued pressure on the working group and financial markets
[00:11:09.386 --> 00:11:11.607]  And the other name for that is the Plunge Protection Team.
[00:11:12.427 --> 00:11:16.729]  And I think they're going to continue to lose power.
[00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:20.670]  Their abilities are going to wane.
[00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:26.573]  Not only in the stock market, but also in other markets as well.
[00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:35.016]  And as this unfolds, I think that the stock market will go lower, the dollar will go lower,
[00:11:36.114 --> 00:11:49.064]  against other currencies, and all currencies will go lower against gold, and gold will finally, over the next year, break loose and get on its own and go to the level where it reasonably should be.
[00:11:49.985 --> 00:11:53.147]  By the way, Bob, a lot of other big... ...historical basis.
[00:11:53.428 --> 00:11:53.948]  Say that again.
[00:11:54.188 --> 00:11:55.249]  No, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[00:11:55.289 --> 00:11:57.371]  A lot of mainline analysts are saying what you're saying.
[00:11:57.411 --> 00:12:02.515]  They're saying that big financial institutions, by cutting off liquidity, by killing the markets,
[00:12:02.995 --> 00:12:03.255]  Are you?
[00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:27.245]  Yes, it's going to be worse than the 1930s for a number of reasons.
[00:12:27.265 --> 00:12:33.007]  It's like a spinning top and the top just goes faster and faster and all of a sudden it flips out and goes into orbit.
[00:12:33.247 --> 00:12:37.048]  You don't see it anymore because the system collapses.
[00:12:51.144 --> 00:12:52.164]  And that's what we're faced with.
[00:12:52.524 --> 00:12:57.866]  Yes, we had abuse of credit during the 1920s, but nothing like you see today.
[00:12:58.326 --> 00:13:00.947]  I mean, there were no credit cards, just as an example.
[00:13:01.828 --> 00:13:05.249]  And we had relative law and order in those days.
[00:13:05.749 --> 00:13:12.431]  There were not large amounts of criminals, like the millions of people who are incarcerated in America today.
[00:13:13.191 --> 00:13:19.614]  And so the underlying... And we were a creditor nation.
[00:13:19.654 --> 00:13:20.514]  People owed us money.
[00:13:21.287 --> 00:13:25.869]  And we had backing on our currency of gold, which we don't have today.
[00:13:25.909 --> 00:13:35.574]  So all of these factors and many others, you put them together, and as they say in England, it looks like a dog's breakfast from here to 2012.
[00:13:36.755 --> 00:13:39.796]  And I agree, things are going to get nasty.
[00:13:40.197 --> 00:13:44.859]  I keep on telling people over and over again, get out of debt, the credit card debt, the revolving debt.
[00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:48.641]  You know, get the things you need, the food.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.723]  The filter, the weapons, you're going to need them.
[00:13:55.163 --> 00:13:59.405]  Bob, what about this G20 meeting in D.C.
[00:13:59.845 --> 00:14:09.750]  this weekend, openly announcing, Baron Rothschild was in the UAE national paper saying, we're setting up world government, this is the new world order.
[00:14:10.973 --> 00:14:14.015]  Meanwhile, Rush Limbaugh says the Rothschilds don't exist.
[00:14:14.055 --> 00:14:18.618]  That's a quote to his idiot, fake conservative audience that's been lulled to sleep.
[00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:23.461]  We're the real conservatives, by the way, if you didn't know that, if you're a Rush Limbaugh minion.
[00:14:25.182 --> 00:14:29.365]  I mean, this is going to be a rude awakening for them who keep living in denial, but that's part two.
[00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:31.406]  What do you see coming up this weekend?
[00:14:33.767 --> 00:14:36.469]  Well, we've really touched on the two main points.
[00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.351]  There'll be a number of things put forward.
[00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:45.923]  On transparency, which is just a sub-diffuse.
[00:14:46.423 --> 00:14:55.210]  And they'll talk about global warming, and talk about China spending $460 billion on infrastructure.
[00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:01.274]  And, you know, the Chinese just spent a lot of time over that last year.
[00:15:02.035 --> 00:15:06.518]  Their currency had strengthened, and their inflation dropped from about 8% to about 4.2%.
[00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:22.114]  And, you know, they were kind of getting it together, although unemployment was rising because economic growth had dropped from 11, 11.5% down to about 9.5%, and they're projecting 9% this coming year.
[00:15:22.575 --> 00:15:28.317]  Although I see Credit Suisse is projecting 7.2%, and I think Credit Suisse is right.
[00:15:28.757 --> 00:15:34.079]  And anything under 8% means riots, all kinds of real problems in China.
[00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:35.319]  And they've already got them.
[00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:36.539]  They already have plenty of
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:39.921]  Demonstration.
[00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:45.026]  What they've got is Chinese cops raping little girls, being caught on tape.
[00:15:45.326 --> 00:15:46.367]  They burn whole cities.
[00:15:46.687 --> 00:15:47.928]  You just don't hear about it in our news.
[00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:57.677]  The Chinese people, you want to call it the American spirit, which is arrogant, the human spirit, they are taking on the police and the military and defeating them all across the country.
[00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:02.318]  And even with a quote, good economy, the people are sick of being slaves.
[00:16:02.578 --> 00:16:08.280]  The Chinese people in Beijing climb up on lampposts and pull down surveillance cameras.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.720]  They will not allow it.
[00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:13.801]  And that's what's so shameful, is Americans think we're so free.
[00:16:14.201 --> 00:16:18.323]  Even in communist China, they want the liberty.
[00:16:20.223 --> 00:16:21.884]  Everybody wants liberty and freedom.
[00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:26.865]  And when you have essentially a mercantilist system,
[00:16:27.837 --> 00:16:29.317]  That's operating in the world today.
[00:16:30.238 --> 00:16:35.259]  This is the old British system that Alexander Hamilton wanted to hang on Americans.
[00:16:36.339 --> 00:16:55.824]  This is the system which allows open and free trade and the people who make all the money are the transnational elitist corporations and then they take that money to extend into control and that's what we've got today and it's got to be reversed in order for
[00:16:56.328 --> 00:17:01.055]  For Western Europe and America and many other parts of the world to survive.
[00:17:01.956 --> 00:17:06.163]  We can't have free trade because there's no level playing field.
[00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:11.176]  I mean, every time they have free trade, people start devaluing their currencies.
[00:17:11.216 --> 00:17:13.676]  Well, that's the biggest issue that I always make.
[00:17:14.096 --> 00:17:16.377]  Yeah, so they can make the goods cheaper there and undercut you.
[00:17:17.377 --> 00:17:21.878]  That the globalists admit in their own handbooks, UN, Club of Rome, that the global warming's all fake.
[00:17:21.918 --> 00:17:24.898]  It's a tax to regulate and control our everyday lives.
[00:17:25.738 --> 00:17:27.219]  That's why they chose carbon dioxide.
[00:17:27.499 --> 00:17:32.200]  It's basically output in all manufacturing, all commerce, you know, transportation, you name it.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.360]  It's a total control.
[00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.673]  But I mean, let's just say it's real.
[00:17:36.713 --> 00:17:37.815]  Carbon dioxide is deadly.
[00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:44.646]  How is not letting us have basically any output here and taxing it?
[00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:59.474]  Going to empower the people or stop global warming when it will just make all the industry that hasn't left, that 20%, go to India and China and Mexico and Bangalore.
[00:18:00.194 --> 00:18:07.776]  And all the studies show these policies will boost greenhouse gases because the industry will go to nations that have no controls.
[00:18:08.176 --> 00:18:10.676]  And the UN has no intention of making those countries do it.
[00:18:10.876 --> 00:18:11.836]  This is asinine.
[00:18:13.417 --> 00:18:15.497]  It just shows you the fallacy of the whole thing.
[00:18:16.115 --> 00:18:19.136]  It just shows you what a big lie it is and what a big scam it is.
[00:18:19.596 --> 00:18:20.636]  It's just like terrorism.
[00:18:20.656 --> 00:18:22.137]  I mean, where is it?
[00:18:23.557 --> 00:18:24.397]  It doesn't exist.
[00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:27.338]  Except in small pockets here and there.
[00:18:27.858 --> 00:18:30.179]  The point is, it was the scam to get it going.
[00:18:30.999 --> 00:18:34.040]  I would have never dreamed they would have been able to get away with it, but they have.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.882]  And, of course, the extension of that is this, quote, financial meeting that they're having for the Group of 20.
[00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:50.177]  As you said earlier, it'll be stretched over a year or two before they are attempting to get implemented what they want.
[00:18:50.757 --> 00:18:57.679]  In the meantime, as we've discussed before on the program, I think there's a good chance that they're going to have another war.
[00:18:58.339 --> 00:18:58.899]  A bigger one.
[00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:01.580]  And Paul described that last week.
[00:19:02.998 --> 00:19:06.000]  What do you think the big surprise is, the 21st or 22nd?
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.783]  I want to be clear, we're already being blamed for that we're making the prediction.
[00:19:10.363 --> 00:19:18.709]  No, we're talking about Biden, talking about Powell, talking about Merkel, Barroso, Brown, the Secretary of State Rice.
[00:19:19.089 --> 00:19:21.811]  We're not saying it, they're saying it's going to happen.
[00:19:22.031 --> 00:19:26.874]  If it doesn't happen, that's just them terrorizing us, but we have to report on them saying this.
[00:19:26.934 --> 00:19:27.595]  What is it, Bob?
[00:19:29.693 --> 00:19:39.836]  Well, it could very well be an invasion of another country, which would bait Russia or force Russia into a confrontation with the United States, because Russia is the one that they're after.
[00:19:40.076 --> 00:19:41.277]  Alright, we've got so much to cover.
[00:19:41.297 --> 00:19:45.378]  For everybody on the AM and FM, all our great affiliates, be sure and support the sponsors coming up.
[00:19:45.398 --> 00:19:55.541]  For everybody else, I'm going to talk to Bob on the web and at PrisonPlanet.tv during this break to take some phone calls, because I don't want to waste any time here today in the time we have left.
[00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.002]  InfoWars.com is the website.
[00:19:59.548 --> 00:20:06.814]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to, I guess Turbo's up next, John?
[00:20:08.195 --> 00:20:08.695]  Yep, that's correct.
[00:20:09.136 --> 00:20:14.000]  Turbo in California, you're on the air with Alex Jones and Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:24.849]  Hey, Alex, first let me say that I am a member, a subscriber of Prison Planet TV and it's wonderful.
[00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.711]  Thank you for making the show possible.
[00:20:28.451 --> 00:20:28.912]  Well, sir,
[00:20:30.222 --> 00:20:36.107]  Now, uh, my original reason for calling up, I've been on hold for like 45 minutes.
[00:20:36.307 --> 00:20:37.228]  I understand.
[00:20:37.809 --> 00:20:50.440]  Okay, I was for, uh, to ask you a two-part question, but after hearing Mr. Chapman there, I gotta tell Mr. Chapman that, yeah, okay, here in California, the people in prison
[00:20:50.868 --> 00:20:51.088]  They're
[00:21:10.129 --> 00:21:13.210]  We're 90% agrarian instead of 90% urban.
[00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:18.893]  You know, in shorthand, he was just saying that people aren't as well behaved as they were.
[00:21:18.993 --> 00:21:19.953]  They're more spoiled.
[00:21:20.234 --> 00:21:21.514]  They're not self-sufficient.
[00:21:22.174 --> 00:21:30.998]  And because they criminalize drugs and things, it created other corollary crime syndicates or
[00:21:33.391 --> 00:21:36.532]  Energy centers to be colleges of crime.
[00:21:36.592 --> 00:21:37.613]  Bob, do you agree with that statement?
[00:21:38.313 --> 00:21:39.594]  Absolutely, I do.
[00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:40.674]  And he's right, too.
[00:21:40.694 --> 00:21:51.399]  You know, my former son-in-law had a master's and was studying a PhD in criminology, and I've read the books, and he's absolutely right.
[00:21:51.879 --> 00:21:53.360]  Well, sir, now let me say this.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:22:00.863]  Now, this goes back to why I originally called you Alex, because I put a lot of stock in your opinions.
[00:22:01.503 --> 00:22:01.663]  Now,
[00:22:03.613 --> 00:22:12.559]  And I don't know if you coined this phrase, but you've certainly used it, the Bush-Cheney crime cartel, the war profiteering corporations.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:30.212]  Now, sir, they are the criminals that have us Americans, like, in a stranglehold of evil, with their depleted uranium munitions, over 4 million innocent Iraqi people,
[00:22:31.229 --> 00:22:38.455]  Well, that's right, it's 3 million dead from machine gun bullets, cholera, starvation, bombs.
[00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:52.708]  But there are, I was about to say, millions more, their cancer rate in the regions where it was used is 5 times normal, and the birth defects are even higher than that, and all these arrogant Americans who think, oh good, they're brown people, kill them.
[00:22:52.988 --> 00:22:54.530]  The elite doesn't care about you either.
[00:22:56.972 --> 00:23:05.357]  I talked to a man from New York City the other day, and he said, oh, the war is good because it shows how strong America is.
[00:23:05.757 --> 00:23:13.141]  And I said, sir, what the war shows is the destruction of the United States of America by the filthy corporations.
[00:23:13.321 --> 00:23:22.447]  And it shows that the American people, you know, I played that clip earlier of Americans on the street corner going, bomb this city, bomb that country, bomb France, bomb, bomb.
[00:23:22.647 --> 00:23:23.988]  It's like a petty demonic
[00:23:24.868 --> 00:23:34.212]  petty ego power to imagine killing people that makes them, in their dim little minds, feel some glint of activity or life.
[00:23:34.272 --> 00:23:37.513]  It's just, they're dull, goblin-like creatures.
[00:23:37.573 --> 00:23:39.334]  But there are a lot of good people left in the country.
[00:23:39.674 --> 00:23:44.696]  That's why we have to fight the evil, so that we can protect ourselves and protect others and not let the globalists...
[00:23:45.416 --> 00:23:47.418]  And I say one more thing before I go.
[00:23:47.438 --> 00:23:48.419]  Okay, I'll say this.
[00:23:48.439 --> 00:23:49.780]  Okay, I was in prison for seven years and eight months.
[00:24:10.874 --> 00:24:15.755]  Okay, Turbo in California wants to make a comment with Bob Chapman.
[00:24:15.795 --> 00:24:16.476]  Go ahead, Turbo.
[00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:17.036]  You're on the air.
[00:24:17.596 --> 00:24:18.176]  Okay, sir.
[00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:22.697]  Sir, I was in prison here in California for seven years and eight months.
[00:24:23.397 --> 00:24:24.638]  I lost my land.
[00:24:24.738 --> 00:24:27.619]  I lost my right to own a firearm.
[00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:30.139]  I don't consider myself to be a criminal.
[00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:31.960]  You know who the criminals are?
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:40.162]  The criminals are all the way from the White House to their whorehouse to their courthouse
[00:24:40.691 --> 00:24:43.378]  To their jailhouse and to their nut house, sir!
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.261]  I am not a criminal.
[00:24:45.761 --> 00:24:46.822]  I am not a criminal.
[00:24:46.922 --> 00:24:48.503]  I never hurt anybody.
[00:24:48.523 --> 00:24:49.364]  I never stole anything.
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.061]  Under orders, but the cops being attacked didn't know they were other cops.
[00:25:19.021 --> 00:25:20.742]  And it came out because cops blew the whistle.
[00:25:21.122 --> 00:25:22.282]  But this happens everywhere.
[00:25:23.062 --> 00:25:26.543]  And so how do I say, oh yes, officers, I trust you so much.
[00:25:26.963 --> 00:25:32.465]  Everywhere I go at demonstrations, you attack cops to blame it on me to attack the First Amendment.
[00:25:33.045 --> 00:25:36.746]  And, you know, they've caught more sheriffs, two or three of them, the last month in Texas.
[00:25:37.426 --> 00:25:40.589]  Well, at the moment you can't do anything, but I think what's going to happen
[00:26:05.686 --> 00:26:10.770]  Is they will extend their criminal activities and the good ones won't participate.
[00:26:11.431 --> 00:26:11.951]  They'll quit.
[00:26:12.752 --> 00:26:22.439]  And, uh, and they will, they, the bad ones, will go in a league with whomever, uh, the military is that accompanies them.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:30.245]  And, uh, they will become the, uh, jackbooted SS, uh, that is going to try to lord over us.
[00:26:30.806 --> 00:26:33.888]  And that's about the time then we're going to have to act to stop them.
[00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:56.120]  By the way, they announced, and the Governor didn't say this, the proposal is checkpoints to check insurance, driver's license, they're going to arrest and ticket citizens, when they do pull over an illegal alien, they generally let them go or they get a $50 fine, so they throw the book at citizens but not at the illegal aliens, and that's on record.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:02.004]  But they sell it that it's to stop the illegal aliens all over the country, but also right here in Texas.
[00:27:02.444 --> 00:27:04.465]  Warrantless mass checkpoints.
[00:27:04.966 --> 00:27:07.608]  I mean, that's like third world dictatorships right there, Bob.
[00:27:08.528 --> 00:27:09.549]  It certainly is.
[00:27:09.969 --> 00:27:14.813]  In fact, I don't think in Soviet countries they even went that far.
[00:27:15.954 --> 00:27:19.156]  I mean, they had their Stasi and KGB and so on.
[00:27:19.816 --> 00:27:23.119]  But checkpoints only usually at borders.
[00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:32.196]  And, you know, they usually will minefields and barbed wire and other things to keep people from breaking out of their prisons, so to speak.
[00:27:32.216 --> 00:27:32.496]  That's right.
[00:27:32.516 --> 00:27:35.178]  If we had a real border, it would have a minefield on it.
[00:27:36.418 --> 00:27:36.659]  Yes.
[00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:38.500]  That's a good point.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.704]  But the influx that is coming in over our borders is slowing because there isn't any jobs to be filled.
[00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:50.086]  And the main reason people leave other countries is to make a better living.
[00:27:50.707 --> 00:27:52.428]  And so that's naturally going to slow down.
[00:27:53.166 --> 00:27:54.366]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:28:14.144 --> 00:28:15.585]  In fact, let me just show the viewers.
[00:28:15.645 --> 00:28:16.425]  They won't believe me.
[00:28:17.626 --> 00:28:18.886]  Oh, I had it here in my stack.
[00:28:19.587 --> 00:28:23.468]  Let me just show the viewers out there that are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:25.569]  Well, I'll find it during the next break.
[00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.050]  It was in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.811]  It just said they're going to shut down roads.
[00:28:29.051 --> 00:28:30.152]  You may have to wait for hours.
[00:28:30.272 --> 00:28:31.072]  Everyone will be checked.
[00:28:31.092 --> 00:28:32.053]  Their papers will be checked.
[00:28:32.533 --> 00:28:34.174]  I mean, is that land of the free and the brave, Bob?
[00:28:34.934 --> 00:28:35.314]  Hardly.
[00:28:36.295 --> 00:28:37.315]  That is the police state.
[00:28:37.355 --> 00:28:38.075]  There's no question.
[00:28:38.256 --> 00:28:39.576]  Let's talk to Bob in California.
[00:28:39.596 --> 00:28:40.557]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[00:28:40.577 --> 00:28:40.997]  Go ahead, Bob.
[00:28:44.408 --> 00:28:55.734]  You guys were talking about the police, and that was one of the things I wanted to talk to you about more towards Alex.
[00:28:57.175 --> 00:29:01.837]  I think our police and our military are going to be needed for our own support.
[00:29:03.478 --> 00:29:08.221]  And I think criticism, as you said, the majority of them are corrupt.
[00:29:09.759 --> 00:29:25.407]  No, what I said is the attack pattern, the setup, the commanders, the government is bad and so they're giving them unlawful illegal orders and setting the precedent to violate the Constitution and Bill of Rights and to bring in a tyranny.
[00:29:26.908 --> 00:29:36.113]  There is a minority in there and it's a minority with the trilateralists and the new one world government people.
[00:29:36.957 --> 00:29:39.738]  Well, that minority is in the command positions.
[00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:42.798]  We're going to skip this break again on the internet.
[00:29:42.818 --> 00:29:45.979]  We'll keep talking about this with our guests, and I'll play a clip when we come back.
[00:29:46.019 --> 00:29:49.419]  Stay with me.
[00:29:49.879 --> 00:29:51.740]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:57.081]  Sir, what I'm saying is the command structure, the policy of the government.
[00:29:57.101 --> 00:30:01.402]  It's like every German soldier wasn't bad, but their commanders were bad.
[00:30:01.742 --> 00:30:03.622]  Their government was run by bad people.
[00:30:04.545 --> 00:30:04.966]  Okay.
[00:30:05.586 --> 00:30:09.710]  And so they say, support the policy of us taking blood without a warrant at a checkpoint.
[00:30:10.731 --> 00:30:13.894]  You know, support us having warrantless checkpoints of everybody.
[00:30:14.274 --> 00:30:18.178]  Support us having your children in school be taught to tattletale on you.
[00:30:18.679 --> 00:30:20.380]  I mean, they do that in Austin.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.983]  I have their own police training videos for the kids.
[00:30:23.023 --> 00:30:25.165]  It's in my film, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:30:25.826 --> 00:30:27.948]  I mean, the police produced it.
[00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.950]  That's not good.
[00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.171]  That's not our system.
[00:30:31.211 --> 00:30:32.271]  We know that's bad.
[00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:34.372]  That's what we supposedly fought before.
[00:30:34.812 --> 00:30:43.454]  So I'm not saying the average cop out there writing tickets or, you know, responding to fires or bank robberies is a bad person.
[00:30:44.014 --> 00:30:45.555]  Bob Shabman, can you explain this to him?
[00:30:47.115 --> 00:30:48.876]  Well, I think you've explained it pretty well.
[00:30:49.276 --> 00:30:56.578]  There is a core of people at the top who are taking orders from Washington, in part because they're partially funded very often.
[00:30:57.242 --> 00:31:09.670]  And of course they like the money coming back to them as well from the drug bust that they get involved in and that allows them to pay the employees more money and allows them to easily fund their operation or expand them.
[00:31:10.171 --> 00:31:11.512]  Make little kingdoms out of them.
[00:31:12.893 --> 00:31:15.835]  The police are between.
[00:31:16.795 --> 00:31:19.057]  They follow orders or they lose their job.
[00:31:19.717 --> 00:31:25.601]  And there will come a time when there are police people who will say, no, I'm not going to do that.
[00:31:25.641 --> 00:31:26.942]  It's an unlawful order.
[00:31:27.475 --> 00:31:30.937]  And I'm going home, and you can find somebody else to do this job.
[00:31:32.358 --> 00:31:37.641]  I don't think the majority will do that, but there will be police who will do that, who have a conscience.
[00:31:37.901 --> 00:31:39.342]  Well, we know that's been happening.
[00:31:39.362 --> 00:31:40.243]  It's over money.
[00:31:41.604 --> 00:31:44.485]  We know they've been doing it, but then you're left with all the bad guys.
[00:31:45.726 --> 00:31:46.246]  That's true.
[00:31:46.807 --> 00:31:49.008]  But, you know, they stand a tremendous risk.
[00:31:49.588 --> 00:31:54.051]  Here they are in a country of over 300 million people that
[00:31:56.391 --> 00:31:58.953]  This has 450 million weapons.
[00:31:59.593 --> 00:32:02.075]  I mean, what can these police be thinking of?
[00:32:02.615 --> 00:32:07.738]  Just because they wear black uniforms and they've got weapons does not mean that they're going to win anything.
[00:32:07.898 --> 00:32:08.138]  Yeah.
[00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:10.900]  I mean, we're as well trained as they are.
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.281]  Many, many of us went through the military.
[00:32:13.842 --> 00:32:18.084]  Many of us have killed people and many of us know how to handle weapons.
[00:32:18.465 --> 00:32:22.327]  And if they think they're going to be effective in doing what they're doing, they're crazy.
[00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:23.728]  They're all going to get wiped out.
[00:32:24.489 --> 00:32:24.871]  That's right.
[00:32:30.865 --> 00:32:31.185]  That's right.
[00:32:31.225 --> 00:32:35.749]  We're not the ones that just stole five trillion dollars and won't say where two trillion went.
[00:32:36.129 --> 00:32:37.590]  That's in Bloomberg and AP.
[00:32:38.191 --> 00:32:40.192]  We're not the ones that did all of this.
[00:32:40.272 --> 00:32:41.333]  We're not the bad guys.
[00:32:41.613 --> 00:32:42.874]  Turbo, I appreciate your call.
[00:32:43.214 --> 00:32:48.378]  Hey, John, I meant to tell you, come in with the Martial Law clip one.
[00:32:49.339 --> 00:32:51.781]  Come in with the Martial Law clip one right now and then play music after.
[00:32:51.801 --> 00:32:52.501]  Do you have time to do that?
[00:32:52.862 --> 00:32:53.502]  Yep, I got that.
[00:32:53.562 --> 00:32:54.303]  It's really long, though.
[00:32:54.523 --> 00:32:56.244]  No, no, we're just going to play the first few minutes of it.
[00:32:56.444 --> 00:32:56.965]  The intro.
[00:32:57.025 --> 00:32:57.985]  Martial Law clip one.
[00:32:58.005 --> 00:32:58.626]  Alright, here we go.
[00:33:02.277 --> 00:33:07.958]  We're actually getting funded by the same people.
[00:33:08.558 --> 00:33:09.538]  It's all consolidation.
[00:33:09.558 --> 00:33:11.039]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:33:11.079 --> 00:33:11.219]  Good.
[00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:12.459]  Thank you.
[00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:15.720]  Alright, that's a clip from Marshall Law.
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.760]  Sounds good to me.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.680]  But no, John, it's the other clip I sent you.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.041]  I sent you two Marshall Law clips.
[00:33:21.821 --> 00:33:23.701]  That's the one that had the time code cut out in it.
[00:33:24.381 --> 00:33:28.102]  It was the first Marshall Law clip I sent you with the intro to the film.
[00:33:29.107 --> 00:33:30.208]  That's the only one I received.
[00:33:30.328 --> 00:33:32.729]  Oh, I guess the IM didn't send you the other one.
[00:33:32.969 --> 00:33:33.409]  Well, St.
[00:33:33.429 --> 00:33:34.730]  Lovie, I'll play it at the end of the show.
[00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:40.833]  I wanted to play the intro to Marshall Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, where we broke down what was happening in the nation.
[00:33:41.934 --> 00:33:52.960]  But, Bob Chapman, here it is, in the mainstream media, in Bloomberg, in the New York Times,
[00:34:00.462 --> 00:34:18.898]  and we have the bankers just openly coming out and saying we can do whatever we want whenever we want however we want
[00:34:20.453 --> 00:34:29.378]  And we are just going to take the money and use it for bonuses and we are going to buy healthy financial institutions and sports teams and water districts.
[00:34:29.978 --> 00:34:32.040]  And they even tell the New York Times that and laugh.
[00:34:33.741 --> 00:34:35.622]  These are professional serious crooks.
[00:34:35.662 --> 00:34:36.322]  They're focused.
[00:34:37.503 --> 00:34:38.943]  Why the added insult?
[00:34:39.364 --> 00:34:43.986]  Is it part of urinating on us like a bigger dog does to a smaller dog to kind of set a precedent?
[00:34:46.148 --> 00:34:46.828]  They're in the open.
[00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:54.392]  They've been forced into the open by people like yourself and others who have programs which are similar.
[00:34:54.892 --> 00:34:55.952]  Writers like myself.
[00:34:56.873 --> 00:34:59.233]  And they figure, well, the public knows it now.
[00:34:59.953 --> 00:35:01.854]  They're going to hear it if they haven't heard it already.
[00:35:02.334 --> 00:35:03.755]  And so let's do what we're going to do.
[00:35:03.795 --> 00:35:04.575]  We've got the power.
[00:35:05.355 --> 00:35:07.416]  We control this vast military system.
[00:35:07.896 --> 00:35:09.276]  We control the source of money.
[00:35:10.517 --> 00:35:12.597]  We can really do anything we want.
[00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:15.398]  So, you know, we don't care what these people think anymore.
[00:35:16.161 --> 00:35:23.347]  I mean, we have elections, we control all the candidates, with minor exception, and they buy in every single election.
[00:35:24.628 --> 00:35:25.769]  And so they do what they want.
[00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:28.231]  And it's just arrogance.
[00:35:29.152 --> 00:35:32.434]  And we, you know, they've opened the window of opportunity.
[00:35:33.355 --> 00:35:34.036]  And they know that.
[00:35:34.736 --> 00:35:44.044]  And so what we must do is we must wait for them to cross the Rubicon, so to speak, for them to make a fatal mistake.
[00:35:44.484 --> 00:35:45.665]  And I think a fatal mistake
[00:35:46.024 --> 00:35:47.805]  Would be insurrection in the United States.
[00:35:48.205 --> 00:35:51.707]  The minute that starts, believe me, they are at risk.
[00:35:52.387 --> 00:35:56.209]  There are thousands and thousands of people out there who know who they are.
[00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.411]  And if they think they're going to escape this thing, they're crazy.
[00:36:02.253 --> 00:36:03.174]  Bob, I agree.
[00:36:04.134 --> 00:36:11.820]  I mean, they would try with Limbaugh, their main mouthpiece, the fake conservative, to neutralize their main enemy, real conservatives, who know the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:21.506]  He would say there's no such thing as a CFR, no such thing as a Bilderberg, no such thing as a Trilateral Commission, no such thing as a New World Order.
[00:36:22.685 --> 00:36:24.026]  No such thing as a Rothschild.
[00:36:24.467 --> 00:36:26.749]  And now, it's just everywhere.
[00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:36.498]  And they go, yeah, we're going to have a world government run by private banks, and yeah, we're taking the money and not telling you where it went, and yeah, there's trillions missing from the Pentagon, and they tell Congress, we're not telling you!
[00:36:37.459 --> 00:36:39.220]  And if you don't pass the bailout, martial law!
[00:36:40.143 --> 00:36:47.367]  So you're right, the gauntlet is thrown down because they have to act normal so their bureaucrats and enforcers will follow the orders.
[00:36:47.427 --> 00:36:58.832]  It's that, you know, like, acting like you're normal, stealing somebody's TV set as you walk out of their apartment and, you know, not running with a TV set so people would think you're acting suspicious, like, yeah, I'm here with a TV set, big deal.
[00:37:00.353 --> 00:37:04.535]  And so it's kind of like, I mean, really, they are, I mean, but,
[00:37:05.953 --> 00:37:11.475]  I mean, who would... Still, it's amazing to watch them just steal all the money right in front of us and say they're stealing it.
[00:37:12.195 --> 00:37:13.355]  And tell Congress... Incredible.
[00:37:13.375 --> 00:37:15.316]  I mean, with trillions of dollars.
[00:37:16.617 --> 00:37:25.339]  I mean, we get people in prison, and rightly so, who committed an armed robbery and got $157.
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.661]  Maybe they had a knife, maybe they had a gun, and they're doing five or ten years in jail.
[00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:33.102]  And these people don't...
[00:37:33.658 --> 00:37:34.259]  Take $157.
[00:37:34.479 --> 00:37:39.163]  They don't use a weapon, although their position is a weapon.
[00:37:40.364 --> 00:37:42.106]  They just go out and steal trillions.
[00:37:42.226 --> 00:37:43.507]  It's beyond imagination.
[00:37:44.648 --> 00:37:50.153]  Crime has now become, along with lying, socially and politically acceptable.
[00:37:51.328 --> 00:37:55.371]  Yeah, the public was trained that it's cute that Clinton lied, and cute that Bush lies.
[00:37:56.012 --> 00:38:01.216]  No, it's not cute, folks, because then society breaks down, and we become a third world country when confidence is lost.
[00:38:01.236 --> 00:38:10.082]  You know, America's not perfect, but we were the most upright, we were the most trustworthy in business until about 50 years ago, and that's why business thrived here.
[00:38:10.823 --> 00:38:14.566]  And the main reason was, if you cheated somebody in business, they would normally come shoot you.
[00:38:15.803 --> 00:38:30.489]  I mean, you know, going back to the family annals, I mean, I had great-great-great grandpas and people that, you know, you'd read about, you know, at the county seat in their history department and would go shoot somebody or go beat them to death, you know, with an axe if somebody cheated them.
[00:38:30.969 --> 00:38:35.251]  So people were polite because people would kill you if you cheated them.
[00:38:35.911 --> 00:38:37.893]  And then now it's just like it's funny and cute.
[00:38:38.273 --> 00:38:39.654]  Ah, kill all those Iraqis.
[00:38:39.694 --> 00:38:40.655]  Good, I'm glad they're dying.
[00:38:40.895 --> 00:38:42.136]  Good, steal all the money.
[00:38:42.536 --> 00:38:43.217]  Steal the oil.
[00:38:43.737 --> 00:38:46.299]  Don't those people get that they're going to be screwed as well?
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.801]  That's what I was just saying.
[00:38:49.522 --> 00:38:52.264]  We have a long list, and they are not going to escape.
[00:38:53.145 --> 00:38:56.587]  And half of America will probably die in the process, but they're going to get theirs.
[00:38:57.388 --> 00:38:58.909]  And all their power is going to be gone.
[00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:03.813]  It's just going to be like 1348, when the Lombard system collapsed.
[00:39:04.949 --> 00:39:06.810]  The same group of people ran in terror.
[00:39:10.513 --> 00:39:12.634]  But they regrouped and came back again.
[00:39:12.675 --> 00:39:17.898]  I want to go to some calls and put you on hold for just a minute Bob because I'm going to plug some sponsors here for just a moment.
[00:39:20.475 --> 00:39:22.397]  We're going to go back to your calls.
[00:39:22.417 --> 00:39:27.241]  I know a lot of these calls were holding from before the time Bob was here, but we've got him here to take your financial questions.
[00:39:27.261 --> 00:39:37.350]  He can speak on any issue, but I'm going to just run through Aaron, Dwayne, Jim, and David's calls, and then anybody else who has financial questions right up to the end with Bob Chapman.
[00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:40.673]  Before I do that, I want to tell you about New Vitality.
[00:39:41.473 --> 00:39:45.317]  New Vitality is just a fabulous vitamin, mineral, nutrition company.
[00:39:47.093 --> 00:39:50.941]  They have hundreds of well-documented products that have nutritive and health effects.
[00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:54.067]  No magic claims, no magic bullets, just high quality.
[00:39:56.834 --> 00:39:59.955]  Products like their aloe vera body cleanse.
[00:40:00.255 --> 00:40:06.958]  Aloe vera and 29 other herbs that are known to detoxify and flush your guts out, flush your intestines out, flush your colon out.
[00:40:07.258 --> 00:40:09.419]  It is so important.
[00:40:09.439 --> 00:40:09.739]  800-569-4056.
[00:40:09.759 --> 00:40:10.479]  800-569-4056.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:15.842]  Or go to NewVitality.com.
[00:40:15.862 --> 00:40:20.043]  If you forget the banner, there's one up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:20.063 --> 00:40:21.224]  They have super beta prostate.
[00:40:21.764 --> 00:40:24.365]  And there's also another great sponsor, Food Shortage USA.
[00:40:24.385 --> 00:40:25.205]  Food Shortage USA.
[00:40:49.793 --> 00:40:54.796]  Phase one of the Insiders' plan for a one-rule government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[00:40:54.836 --> 00:41:01.761]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:41:02.221 --> 00:41:03.382]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:41:03.682 --> 00:41:07.705]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize control of power.
[00:41:08.406 --> 00:41:13.169]  One is world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept, and the other is food.
[00:41:14.107 --> 00:41:16.528]  We're witnessing the engineered financial crisis, folks.
[00:41:16.568 --> 00:41:17.729]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:41:17.989 --> 00:41:24.773]  Go to FoodShortageUSA.com to learn how to make your own storable foods for you and your family to prepare for the road ahead.
[00:41:24.793 --> 00:41:29.536]  The website reveals a step-by-step way for the average person to get prepared for what's ahead.
[00:41:29.556 --> 00:41:35.239]  I think the best part about the system is that it gets you off the food grid, even if you don't have a lot of money to spend.
[00:41:35.479 --> 00:41:37.320]  The site is FoodShortageUSA.com.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.521]  It's not too late.
[00:41:39.201 --> 00:41:44.305]  You can still prepare by learning how to make your own survival foods, and you can do it for pennies on the dollar.
[00:41:44.565 --> 00:41:47.307]  Go to FoodShortageUSA.com or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, FoodShortageUSA.com.
[00:41:47.327 --> 00:41:48.428]  And don't forget Bob Chapman.
[00:41:57.754 --> 00:42:13.178]  Bob Chapman will give you online a free copy of his twice-a-week digital, and it's very lengthy and very detailed and riveting information, very important, at TheInternationalForecaster.com or you can get a free hard copy by calling this toll-free number.
[00:42:13.938 --> 00:42:19.519]  Bob, please give them the toll-free number to get a free copy, complimentary copy, of the latest International Forecaster.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.220]  Now that number is 877 479
[00:42:27.591 --> 00:42:31.755]  8178.
[00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:31.755]  That's 877-479-8178.
[00:42:31.775 --> 00:42:43.084]  And you can get either kind, either the hard copy or the email version, by calling that number.
[00:42:43.824 --> 00:42:46.106]  And there's one thing I'd like to interject here.
[00:42:46.486 --> 00:42:50.209]  I don't normally do this, but I've been taking Beta Prostate for 15 years.
[00:42:50.229 --> 00:42:52.131]  And I'm 73 years old.
[00:42:54.711 --> 00:43:05.376]  And I function perfectly and I got a PSA test about a month ago, which the AMA says you don't need at my age because you're going to die anyway.
[00:43:06.136 --> 00:43:17.581]  But the doctor told me that I had a condition which was my physical being was like a 25 year old man and beta prostate had a lot to do with that.
[00:43:17.984 --> 00:43:20.487]  Well yeah, this is a huge company, a huge sponsor for us.
[00:43:20.567 --> 00:43:21.287]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[00:43:21.327 --> 00:43:22.749]  I don't just take any vitamin company.
[00:43:22.769 --> 00:43:25.111]  This is the big main line, the stuff that's proven.
[00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:29.135]  A lot of doctors prescribe Super Beta Prostate or similar products.
[00:43:29.576 --> 00:43:33.360]  I mean, it's 30 herbs, but the main one is the salt palmetto.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.220]  Very strong.
[00:43:35.001 --> 00:43:45.169]  And for some reason, with the stuff we eat and the things we do, by the age of 45, the prostate gets the size of a golf ball, and it's associated with cancer, erectile dysfunction, the list goes on and on.
[00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:51.534]  And yeah, I only plug things I know are important for people, and so that's why we push that.
[00:43:51.955 --> 00:43:53.956]  So again, NewVitality.com, thank you.
[00:43:54.157 --> 00:43:59.481]  Bob, I didn't know you were taking super beta-prostate, but millions of people do, and this is real stuff here.
[00:44:00.041 --> 00:44:02.363]  I want to take calls here for the last 15 minutes, Bob, but
[00:44:03.604 --> 00:44:04.545]  So much is happening.
[00:44:05.705 --> 00:44:07.666]  We see the market going up and down every day.
[00:44:08.347 --> 00:44:15.331]  As confidence, I mean, I guess the elite don't care if confidence is being lost, because they'll just blame that on their next puppet, Barack Obama.
[00:44:15.451 --> 00:44:18.052]  Or, where do you see this crisis in confidence going?
[00:44:18.412 --> 00:44:26.997]  Right now, Congress has this 9% still, but Obama, he does have about a 50% confidence rate right now.
[00:44:27.757 --> 00:44:30.919]  But as soon as they realize he's a con man, they will lose the confidence.
[00:44:30.939 --> 00:44:32.240]  What's going to happen with that honeymoon?
[00:44:33.926 --> 00:44:35.327]  It's going to be devastating.
[00:44:35.748 --> 00:44:48.578]  Normally, when somebody takes office, it's ebullient, and usually the ratings will vary anywhere from usually 60 to 77 percent.
[00:44:49.338 --> 00:44:53.862]  And then the honeymoon's over, and then they find out what they're going to do, and things change sometimes.
[00:44:54.743 --> 00:44:55.623]  And sometimes they don't.
[00:44:56.024 --> 00:44:59.066]  Sometimes they stay strong, so to speak, those ratings.
[00:45:00.014 --> 00:45:12.422]  But I think they're going to find out that they're going to get relatively the same program that the neocons had from Mr. Obama, if not more socialistic in nature.
[00:45:13.083 --> 00:45:19.827]  And their trust and confidence in government, which is poor as it is, will drop even more.
[00:45:19.847 --> 00:45:25.671]  I'm looking at short-term unemployment of 10% the coming year, and that may be very conservative.
[00:45:25.691 --> 00:45:29.394]  Based on government figures, the U6 figure will probably be about
[00:45:30.532 --> 00:45:31.292]  Uh, 14.8%.
[00:45:32.092 --> 00:45:35.913]  The long-term unemployment figure, uh, will probably be somewhere around 19%.
[00:45:36.053 --> 00:45:49.216]  Uh, there are going to be a lot of unhappy people out there who didn't listen to us in this program, and programmers like it, and get themselves out of debt, get their house in order, get the things in that they need to protect their children, feed them.
[00:45:50.496 --> 00:45:53.697]  All of what we're telling you, you know, we don't, we don't get paid to do this.
[00:45:54.517 --> 00:45:56.497]  We, we do this because we want to help you.
[00:45:57.137 --> 00:45:59.638]  And so, do what we're telling you because you're going to need it.
[00:46:01.471 --> 00:46:05.832]  Bob, I mean, you're saying depression within two and a half, three years, basically guaranteed.
[00:46:06.173 --> 00:46:08.173]  More and more mainline analysts are saying that.
[00:46:08.573 --> 00:46:11.234]  The only debate is how bad is it going to get?
[00:46:11.254 --> 00:46:16.776]  A lot of them are now saying, like I said earlier, road warrior type scenarios, total breakdown.
[00:46:16.796 --> 00:46:19.177]  I mean, is it going to get that bad?
[00:46:20.297 --> 00:46:20.818]  Could be.
[00:46:21.758 --> 00:46:22.398]  Nobody knows.
[00:46:23.158 --> 00:46:23.979]  That's possible.
[00:46:24.859 --> 00:46:27.660]  And again, that's why you've got to do those things.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:28.700]  You've got to be prepared.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.981]  And it's like an insurance policy.
[00:46:31.423 --> 00:46:40.947]  If it doesn't happen, you can sit back with a sigh of relief and say, well, this happened, the other thing happened, and short-circuited, and we don't need this food, now we can go and eat it all.
[00:46:41.967 --> 00:46:45.048]  Or we can go out and shoot rabbits with the rifles.
[00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:49.970]  Or we hope that we don't have a hurricane so that we have to use this pump.
[00:46:50.611 --> 00:46:51.411]  And that's okay.
[00:46:51.991 --> 00:46:54.112]  It's just buying an insurance policy.
[00:46:56.089 --> 00:47:04.471]  Well, the good news is the patriots, if all this comes down, which it looks like it is, the people that know about the New World Order, we're going to be positioned better than the general public.
[00:47:04.991 --> 00:47:10.732]  But that's also going to make us targets for robbery and all sorts of stuff, so we've also got to realize that.
[00:47:11.032 --> 00:47:14.953]  But it's better to be prepared and face that than not be prepared and just lay back.
[00:47:15.613 --> 00:47:17.353]  Let's go to Aaron in Washington.
[00:47:17.393 --> 00:47:18.973]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman, Aaron.
[00:47:19.753 --> 00:47:21.434]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on the show.
[00:47:21.654 --> 00:47:22.234]  Thanks for calling.
[00:47:23.004 --> 00:47:25.385]  Hey, listen, I've got a couple things I wanted to bring up.
[00:47:26.165 --> 00:47:27.225]  Bob, I've got a question for you.
[00:47:30.506 --> 00:47:52.531]  With the financial crisis that's going on, do you expect them to, for instance, change the bankruptcy laws so when it really starts hitting the fan and people are losing their houses even more than they are now, plus all their unsecured credit card debts and things like that, and they have no way to pay because they just lost their job, do you foresee them changing the bankruptcy laws to further implement slavery
[00:47:53.343 --> 00:47:54.664]  And bondage through debt?
[00:47:55.904 --> 00:47:56.304]  Could be.
[00:47:56.864 --> 00:47:57.625]  It's hard to say.
[00:47:58.545 --> 00:47:59.765]  They can do anything they want.
[00:48:00.386 --> 00:48:04.607]  So, it's possible and probable that they might do something like that.
[00:48:04.687 --> 00:48:15.471]  Well, Bob, that's what concerns me is that if they'll steal $5 trillion and not even say where $2 trillion went and say, yeah, we lied to you and we're going to take more, what are they going to do next?
[00:48:15.531 --> 00:48:19.753]  I mean, every month it's some new horror and they're openly talking about
[00:48:20.653 --> 00:48:38.827]  Uh, in hearings last week and this week, and now that we actually sent off the C-SPAN and got them, we have them for an upcoming film, and they're talking about taxing pension funds and 401Ks and taking over pension funds, and then they'll pay you a Social Security check out of your own private fund and take part of it.
[00:48:39.288 --> 00:48:42.890]  I mean, I mean, Bob, you know, they just did that in Argentina.
[00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.973]  I mean, the same crew, do you think they could actually get away with that?
[00:48:47.194 --> 00:48:50.076]  They can get away with anything they want, short of revolution.
[00:48:50.974 --> 00:48:53.455]  And they will push the people far enough and that will happen.
[00:48:53.595 --> 00:48:56.837]  And maybe, if it's possible, that could happen.
[00:48:57.057 --> 00:49:01.139]  And the cops are going to gun down old people that are mad their pension funds have been taken.
[00:49:01.419 --> 00:49:07.282]  Or the old folks buy the propaganda of, we're taking it to keep it safe and now we're going to tax it.
[00:49:07.982 --> 00:49:09.323]  And now we're going to take part of it.
[00:49:10.463 --> 00:49:13.624]  And we'll just go, okay, I mean, where does the raping stop?
[00:49:18.607 --> 00:49:20.788]  It stops when the first shot gets fired.
[00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:26.732]  And then people will start thinking, look, I don't have anything left and I don't have anything to lose.
[00:49:27.673 --> 00:49:28.813]  It's the rat in the corner.
[00:49:29.314 --> 00:49:30.154]  You don't put them there.
[00:49:31.515 --> 00:49:32.676]  And that's what they're going to do.
[00:49:32.696 --> 00:49:35.197]  They're not that smart.
[00:49:35.537 --> 00:49:36.838]  We're just as smart as they are.
[00:49:37.959 --> 00:49:39.039]  And they're going to make mistakes.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.600]  But they're arrogant bastards.
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.061]  They know people are going to revolt.
[00:49:42.081 --> 00:49:42.842]  They've been preparing.
[00:49:43.062 --> 00:49:44.583]  They want to have a revolt, Bob.
[00:49:44.883 --> 00:49:45.583]  But I agree with you.
[00:49:45.603 --> 00:49:48.045]  I think they're underestimating their power.
[00:49:49.429 --> 00:49:52.110]  Well, I'll tell you one thing, I'll be back and in the middle of it.
[00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.451]  Even at my advanced age.
[00:49:56.111 --> 00:50:01.473]  Well, the problem is, most of the people that will get killed in a revolt are just going to be cops that don't even know what they're a part of.
[00:50:02.353 --> 00:50:09.735]  But, I mean, that's the final equation, is that the real elites are living in Switzerland.
[00:50:12.596 --> 00:50:14.637]  You know, there's no way that we can't find them.
[00:50:15.757 --> 00:50:16.257]  Believe me.
[00:50:18.278 --> 00:50:19.138]  No, I understand that.
[00:50:20.623 --> 00:50:26.087]  And people are going to be disturbed and writing and doing the same thing in every country in the world.
[00:50:27.528 --> 00:50:29.549]  Some countries will be let off easily.
[00:50:31.711 --> 00:50:34.173]  Their populations won't be as aggressive.
[00:50:35.373 --> 00:50:36.634]  They won't be injured as much.
[00:50:37.675 --> 00:50:41.177]  But in America, it's a wild west society.
[00:50:41.478 --> 00:50:44.280]  And they're different than other people.
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.342]  And I can assure you, it'll be the biggest there.
[00:50:49.153 --> 00:50:57.418]  Yep, a lot of boss hogs are going to be in trouble, but the mothership hogs I don't think will be unless we identify who they are, but we want to stop all of this.
[00:50:57.458 --> 00:50:58.558]  We're going to skip this break too.
[00:51:00.259 --> 00:51:02.421]  Okay, does that answer your question, Aaron?
[00:51:03.401 --> 00:51:15.128]  You know, the funny thing is, my opinion is that these people that are in charge, I think that they want to at some point go completely out in the open and say, guess what?
[00:51:15.768 --> 00:51:16.389]  It's us.
[00:51:17.367 --> 00:51:20.570]  You knew it was us all along, and now we're telling it to you, it's us.
[00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:25.875]  And if you don't do what we say, we'll release Digonian 12, the death virus.
[00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:27.977]  You think they'd really do that?
[00:51:27.997 --> 00:51:30.460]  These people are founded by Lucifer.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.962]  These people are evil incarnate on this planet.
[00:51:33.303 --> 00:51:35.545]  Criminals love to celebrate their evil, that's true.
[00:51:35.585 --> 00:51:38.708]  They do, and they want to show people that it's them.
[00:51:39.332 --> 00:51:41.473]  You know, evil doesn't want to hide underneath a rock.
[00:51:41.533 --> 00:51:48.555]  They actually want to be out there because that's when they know they have the most control over people, is when they can openly do everything they want to do.
[00:51:48.575 --> 00:51:54.036]  Yeah, that's a really great point, the criminology of criminals.
[00:51:54.056 --> 00:51:59.638]  You know, there's some people that steal to survive or whatever and then they feel guilty about it, but your real criminal enjoys fooling people.
[00:51:59.678 --> 00:52:00.338]  They enjoy
[00:52:01.458 --> 00:52:05.381]  My dad always said there's folks that rather cheat you out of a quarter than make a dollar with you.
[00:52:05.801 --> 00:52:07.282]  And they enjoy it.
[00:52:07.742 --> 00:52:08.343]  They love it.
[00:52:09.404 --> 00:52:12.265]  Bob, is that also part of why they're flaunting it in front of our face?
[00:52:13.146 --> 00:52:16.388]  Yes, it's the pathology of a psychopath.
[00:52:17.169 --> 00:52:18.550]  And that's just exactly what they are.
[00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:23.033]  We lightly call them sociopaths, but they're psychopaths.
[00:52:23.793 --> 00:52:26.515]  Who would want to get rid of a whole population?
[00:52:26.555 --> 00:52:27.536]  It's not normal people.
[00:52:27.976 --> 00:52:28.576]  Absolutely.
[00:52:28.636 --> 00:52:29.857]  I appreciate your call.
[00:52:32.152 --> 00:52:32.953]  Let's go ahead.
[00:52:32.973 --> 00:52:35.995]  I'm going to show the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers here on the document cam.
[00:52:37.416 --> 00:52:39.998]  This is out of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:52:40.878 --> 00:52:43.681]  And it says DPS aims for driver's license checkpoints.
[00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:52.927]  And it says they're going to set them up all over the state, but they spin it and claim some say it could be for illegal aliens, knowing it would be popular for the public, you know, to do that.
[00:52:53.327 --> 00:52:54.148]  But this is a trick.
[00:52:55.049 --> 00:52:57.510]  This is not, if you read the fine print, for the illegal aliens.
[00:52:59.051 --> 00:53:00.712]  This is for the general citizenry.
[00:53:01.333 --> 00:53:05.695]  So there is the article DPS aims for driver's license checkpoints.
[00:53:05.895 --> 00:53:13.059]  Here's one that Steve Watson did that details it even more for people that are out there watching.
[00:53:13.099 --> 00:53:17.021]  It says the Texas agency wants to set up statewide driver's license checkpoints.
[00:53:17.081 --> 00:53:19.282]  Motorists would be required to prove legal U.S.
[00:53:19.342 --> 00:53:22.564]  residency as well as part of that.
[00:53:22.604 --> 00:53:23.865]  So that's how they seduce us.
[00:53:24.965 --> 00:53:27.087]  We get so tired of the illegal aliens running around screaming
[00:53:28.027 --> 00:53:28.888]  No, it's for everybody.
[00:53:28.908 --> 00:53:30.790]  And they'll let the illegal aliens go anyway.
[00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:31.711]  They just want to exert control.
[00:53:31.731 --> 00:53:33.833]  This is part of the middle picture of a police state.
[00:53:51.408 --> 00:53:51.848]  Absolutely.
[00:53:51.868 --> 00:53:55.610]  Let's rampage through a few final calls for the full audience when we come back.
[00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:58.552]  Right now in the final segment with Bob Chapman, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:54:20.646 --> 00:54:24.150]  I want to take your calls, but it's hard to turn this song off.
[00:54:41.451 --> 00:54:43.233]  If you love yourself, you truly love others.
[00:54:43.814 --> 00:54:46.017]  Not these fake materialistic New World Order people.
[00:54:46.757 --> 00:54:49.441]  Thank you for joining us in the final segment here today with Bob Chapman.
[00:54:50.161 --> 00:54:52.224]  Let's take a few final calls here as quickly as possible.
[00:54:53.065 --> 00:54:55.107]  Let's talk to Dwayne in Ohio.
[00:54:56.209 --> 00:54:57.610]  You're on the air Dwayne, go ahead.
[00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:59.993]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me.
[00:55:00.253 --> 00:55:00.494]  You bet.
[00:55:01.903 --> 00:55:03.844]  Yeah, I've got a couple things I want to say.
[00:55:03.904 --> 00:55:05.404]  First, I'm a veteran.
[00:55:05.444 --> 00:55:09.786]  You know there's a movement out to disarm veterans because we're unstable people.
[00:55:09.946 --> 00:55:10.266]  No, no.
[00:55:10.467 --> 00:55:11.227]  Clinton started it.
[00:55:11.267 --> 00:55:12.107]  Bush expanded it.
[00:55:12.707 --> 00:55:14.868]  People with no criminal record going to buy a gun.
[00:55:15.188 --> 00:55:18.470]  Grandpas, Korean War vets, and they're being turned down.
[00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:20.310]  Absolutely.
[00:55:20.331 --> 00:55:26.253]  Because us crazy veterans who served our country, they're afraid of us is what it is.
[00:55:27.555 --> 00:55:30.277]  There's also moves to disarm retired cops.
[00:55:30.297 --> 00:55:32.838]  I mean, people, cops and military, figure it out.
[00:55:32.898 --> 00:55:34.579]  You're with the people whether you like it or not.
[00:55:34.879 --> 00:55:37.181]  You better just go ahead and realize that and throw in with us.
[00:55:38.722 --> 00:55:39.342]  Oh, I'm there.
[00:55:39.362 --> 00:55:42.024]  I got the thing that says ATS on the back.
[00:55:42.104 --> 00:55:43.905]  It stands for Anti-Tyranny Squad.
[00:55:44.945 --> 00:55:45.446]  Absolutely.
[00:55:46.586 --> 00:55:55.752]  I guess I'm one of those homegrown terrorists because I have a bumper sticker, a huge 8x11 sticker on the back of my truck that says, Congress Obeyed the Constitution.
[00:55:59.423 --> 00:56:04.167]  Well, you know, I never got to this on the show.
[00:56:04.207 --> 00:56:13.474]  We have CNN today admitting that what we told you a decade ago, that if you protested anyway or even have a table at a farm fair
[00:56:14.255 --> 00:56:26.899]  With any political view, even Rotary Club level, the state police, nationwide and federal funding, try to infiltrate you and spy on you and put you in a homegrown extremist camp.
[00:56:27.459 --> 00:56:31.741]  Anyone who's politically active, that scene is being abnormal.
[00:56:33.021 --> 00:56:36.623]  The American birthright, it's only normal to watch TV, do nothing.
[00:56:36.863 --> 00:56:40.524]  And they're announcing it on CNN to intimidate people.
[00:56:41.459 --> 00:56:43.280]  I think you're absolutely right.
[00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:14.875]  The days of voicing political opinion are coming to a close.
[00:57:15.576 --> 00:57:26.508]  And you saw it at other conventions, you described it with the imposition of police being planted and police beating planted policemen.
[00:57:28.357 --> 00:57:31.340]  And it's just all part and parcel of the same thing.
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:32.861]  It's gotten worse and worse.
[00:57:33.241 --> 00:57:37.865]  How would you get a cop to go stage an attack on other cops to ban free speech?
[00:57:37.925 --> 00:57:39.586]  I mean, how would you feel good at night?
[00:57:39.686 --> 00:57:40.947]  I mean, it's in the Denver Post.
[00:57:40.987 --> 00:57:41.908]  They admit they do it.
[00:57:41.928 --> 00:57:44.710]  It's just incredible.
[00:57:46.172 --> 00:57:47.993]  And it's being done all over the country.
[00:57:48.433 --> 00:57:49.514]  Well, I've caught them myself.
[00:57:49.935 --> 00:57:53.998]  I just don't understand how you would sell out for a paycheck.
[00:57:54.378 --> 00:57:55.699]  Bob Chapman, thanks for joining us.
[00:57:55.719 --> 00:57:56.420]  Talk to you next week.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.321]  We appreciate your time.
[00:57:58.264 --> 00:57:59.285]  I appreciate being here.
[00:57:59.305 --> 00:57:59.625]  Bye-bye.
[00:58:19.293 --> 00:58:24.957]  Right now, it's our Christmas special, holiday special, 5 months, 5.3 months free actually.
[00:58:25.378 --> 00:58:30.501]  Right now at PrisonPlanet.tv and there's so much media, it's so high quality.
[00:58:30.822 --> 00:58:33.684]  Rebroadcast with all the guests we had on today.
[00:58:34.684 --> 00:58:37.706]  Colonel Craig Roberts and others starts now at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:37.727 --> 00:58:38.607]  See you back tomorrow live.
[00:58:38.627 --> 00:58:39.128]  God bless you.
