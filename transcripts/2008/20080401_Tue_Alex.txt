[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:02.131]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:03.872]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:03.872 --> 00:00:05.474]  You want answers?
[00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:07.015]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:11.218]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:15.282]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:34.636]  Running Scandals!
[00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:39.196]  Number three, Iraq and 9-11 Gates.
[00:00:39.196 --> 00:01:00.491]  Former Gitmo detainee Murat Qurnas, repeating in an interview what he had told his attorney three years ago, while still being held by the U.S., that when he was originally picked up and stored in Afghanistan for two months, interrogators hung him by his arms from the ceiling of a freezing aircraft hangar for five days, with doctors coming by periodically to assure his captors it was okay to keep on hanging him there.
[00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:06.475]  Qurnas says his interrogators demanded he admit he was an operative of, and an associate of, Mohammed Atta.
[00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:08.116]  The 9-11 plotter.
[00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:09.997]  The torture, sadly, is old news.
[00:01:09.997 --> 00:01:13.619]  The new news is Karnaz was from Germany.
[00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:13.899]  So?
[00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:23.384]  Remember the attempt to link 9-11 to Iraq by way of Mohammed Atta and some apocryphal meeting he was supposed to have had with the Iraqi intelligence service in Prague, April 2001?
[00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:33.110]  Well, get some German-born Muslim to admit he knew Atta, and you're halfway home to putting Atta at a meeting with Iraqi agents, even if it never happened.
[00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.071]  Number two, Mortgagegate.
[00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:41.556]  Mr. Bush's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Alfonso Jackson, under criminal investigation, has resigned.
[00:01:41.556 --> 00:01:44.958]  The top Bush guy on Holmes quits in the middle of a Holmes crisis.
[00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:50.322]  As the coroner says to Jack Nicholson in the movie Chinatown, middle of a drought and a water commissioner drowns.
[00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:50.742]  Only in L.A.
[00:01:51.963 --> 00:01:54.504]  And number one, Mukasey said, what?
[00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:55.345]  Gate?
[00:01:55.345 --> 00:02:01.047]  Almost ignored in the coverage of his speech to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco pleading for telecom immunity.
[00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:06.950]  Attorney General Michael Mukasey also said, quote, before 9-11, that's the call that we didn't know about.
[00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:14.173]  We knew that there has been a call from someplace that was known to be a safe house in Afghanistan, and we knew that it came to the United States.
[00:02:14.173 --> 00:02:15.954]  We didn't know precisely where it went.
[00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:18.475]  What?
[00:02:18.475 --> 00:02:23.597]  The government knew about some phone call from a safe house in Afghanistan into the U.S.
[00:02:23.597 --> 00:02:33.981]  about 9-11, before 9-11, and even though it had the same FISA courts and the same right to act against international targets in 2001 as it does now?
[00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:35.222]  You didn't do anything about it?
[00:02:36.124 --> 00:02:37.885]  Well, this would seem to leave only two options.
[00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:45.952]  Either the Attorney General just admitted that the government for which he works is guilty of malfeasant complicity in the 9-11 attacks, or he's lying.
[00:02:45.952 --> 00:02:47.853]  I'm betting on lying.
[00:02:47.853 --> 00:02:52.116]  If not, somebody in Congress better put that man under oath right quick.
[00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:53.597]  You could send him to Gitmo, I suppose.
[00:02:55.478 --> 00:02:57.039]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.300]  It is April 1st, 2008.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.044]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:03:03.044 --> 00:03:08.609]  We'll be discussing in more detail the report you just heard Keith Oberman talking about, quite a revelation.
[00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.152]  Then in one hour, Mike Rivero joins us for his monthly visit.
[00:03:12.152 --> 00:03:18.477]  Then we have the physicist Walter L. Wagner coming on to talk about some of the
[00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:34.316]  Different to scientific systems and devices like superconducting super colliders that endanger the very fabric of the dimension that we exist in here in the third dimension.
[00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:37.078]  So those are your guests today in the first hour.
[00:03:37.078 --> 00:03:44.524]  I'm going to cover a lot of important news and then I'm going to do part one at the bottom of the hour in about 28 minutes.
[00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.825]  Kind of a precursor to
[00:03:47.244 --> 00:04:00.279]  Dr. Wagner joining us coming up later in the third hour concerning the type of developments that do endanger humanity that the elite are completely ignoring.
[00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:02.602]  So that is coming up.
[00:04:04.548 --> 00:04:09.372]  In about 30 minutes, here is some of the news in front of me today.
[00:04:09.372 --> 00:04:12.695]  USA, 2008, the Great Depression.
[00:04:12.695 --> 00:04:17.979]  That's the cover of the English daily paper, The Independent.
[00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:26.907]  In other news, bread, milk, eggs prices spike massively, draining locals' wallets.
[00:04:26.907 --> 00:04:27.447]  U.S.
[00:04:27.447 --> 00:04:28.148]  food stamp
[00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:33.342]  Issuance is at all time whopping high.
[00:04:33.342 --> 00:04:39.847]  China stocks tumble 4.1% to new 11-month low.
[00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:44.870]  Retail gasoline prices at record high, $3.29 on average per gallon.
[00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.472]  Congress has big questions for big oil.
[00:04:47.472 --> 00:04:50.074]  UBS writes off $19 billion.
[00:04:50.074 --> 00:04:51.995]  This and a lot more on the other side.
[00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:55.198]  Stay with us.
[00:04:55.198 --> 00:04:56.519]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:57.668 --> 00:04:59.410]  A New World Order.
[00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.334]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:04.334 --> 00:05:07.157]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:07.157 --> 00:05:09.940]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.123]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:13.123 --> 00:05:20.450]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:23.482 --> 00:05:28.906]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:28.906 --> 00:05:32.788]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:35.350]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.511]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:37.311]  They're not after money.
[00:05:37.311 --> 00:05:38.572]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:39.173]  They're after power.
[00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:40.714]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:05:55.973 --> 00:05:58.103]  I'm the New Dramatical Report here on Genesis.

[00:06:53.932 --> 00:06:54.392]  Fact.
[00:06:54.392 --> 00:07:00.434]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:07:00.434 --> 00:07:04.795]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:07:04.795 --> 00:07:12.497]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:07:12.497 --> 00:07:13.277]  The solution.
[00:07:13.277 --> 00:07:17.498]  Detoxification integrated with Electro Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[00:07:17.498 --> 00:07:19.499]  The Electro Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:19.959]  I think so.

[00:09:19.356 --> 00:09:27.838]  The alternative is abject slavery and termination at the hands of the New World Order and I don't want to be part of that.
[00:09:29.244 --> 00:09:39.233]  Okay, let's get into the news, and then we have got several big guests lined up for you today, and a big surprise guest, by the way, early in the show tomorrow.
[00:09:39.233 --> 00:09:53.005]  I'm just going to let you know that, and also next Monday, huge announcement, biggest announcement in the history of this radio show, in the history of what I've been doing
[00:09:53.752 --> 00:10:04.477]  On Talk Radio, period, coming up next Monday, starting in the second hour of the show, I will make the announcement.
[00:10:04.477 --> 00:10:08.218]  USA 2008, the Great Depression.
[00:10:08.218 --> 00:10:11.780]  Food stamps are the symbol of poverty in the U.S.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.363]  In the era of credit crunch, a record 28 million Americans are now relying on them to survive
[00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.934]  A sure sign the world's richest country faces economic crises.
[00:10:24.934 --> 00:10:30.137]  We knew things were bad on Wall Street, but on Main Street it may be worse.
[00:10:30.137 --> 00:10:44.547]  Startling official statistics show that as a new economic recession stalks the United States, a record number of Americans will shortly be depending on food stamps just to feed themselves and their families.
[00:10:46.087 --> 00:10:55.952]  Dismal projections by the Congressional Budget Office in Washington suggest in the fiscal year starting October 28, 28 million people in the U.S.
[00:10:55.952 --> 00:11:03.195]  will be using government food stamps to buy essential groceries, the highest level since the Food Assistance Program was introduced in the 1960s.
[00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:03.615]  The increase
[00:11:05.908 --> 00:11:18.454]  From $26.5 million in 2007 is due partly to recent efforts to increase public awareness of the program and also to switch from paper coupons to electronic debit cards.
[00:11:18.454 --> 00:11:27.199]  But also, above all, it is the pressures being exerted on ordinary Americans by an economy that is suddenly beset by troubles.
[00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:35.323]  Housing foreclosures, accelerating job losses, and fast-rising prices all add to the squeeze.
[00:11:39.193 --> 00:11:41.694]  Meanwhile, this is the Associated Press today.
[00:11:41.694 --> 00:11:46.696]  Analyst predicts corn rationing in 2008.
[00:11:46.696 --> 00:11:53.559]  A BB&T Capital Markets analyst said Monday, corn rationing may be necessary this year.
[00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:55.179]  It's already happening with wheat.
[00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:56.180]  Following a U.S.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:03.842]  Department of Agriculture reporting, predicting farmers would plant fewer, far fewer acres of corn in 2008.
[00:12:03.842 --> 00:12:06.804]  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:12:06.804 --> 00:12:07.684]  Corn's at all-time
[00:12:08.482 --> 00:12:15.905]  Hi, the demand is just absolutely stratospheric, and let's cut back on what we're growing.
[00:12:15.905 --> 00:12:31.890]  According to the March respective planting reports, farmers intend to plant about 86 million acres of corn this year, down 8% from 2007, when the amount of corn planted was the highest since World War II.
[00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.951]  It goes on to how the investors are betting.
[00:12:37.228 --> 00:12:40.929]  Now remember, you don't really see the corn rationing at the store.
[00:12:40.929 --> 00:12:51.052]  It's rationing to the factories that make the cereals and make the breads and the thousands of prepared foods that have it as fillers in it.
[00:12:51.052 --> 00:13:01.635]  And so you will see it manifested by higher prices, and yes, sometimes you'll just go in if it's later in the evening and there won't be bread on the shelves, or your favorite bread won't be there.
[00:13:03.496 --> 00:13:08.119]  I mean, some people are hyping this saying, you know, there'll be absolute food shortages, you won't be able to get food.
[00:13:08.119 --> 00:13:09.540]  I don't agree with that.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.464]  It's just you're going to pay a lot more for food.
[00:13:14.464 --> 00:13:26.052]  There's not going to really be any fuel rationing, it's just that it's going to be a lot more to buy your gas.
[00:13:26.052 --> 00:13:32.997]  And as the hyperinflation sets in in the next 24 months, increasingly getting worse every month,
[00:13:33.982 --> 00:13:35.923]  It's gonna bankrupt a lot of people.
[00:13:35.923 --> 00:13:37.743]  I mean, there are a lot of people living hand-to-mouth.
[00:13:37.743 --> 00:13:43.225]  A lot of people making eight, nine dollars an hour in this country.
[00:13:43.225 --> 00:13:46.166]  Some people make it even less.
[00:13:46.166 --> 00:13:58.229]  And you cannot live on that unless you are living in a communal house, 10, 15 to a house, like the illegal aliens are.
[00:13:58.229 --> 00:14:00.250]  And I'm not knocking them and saying they're bad people.
[00:14:01.118 --> 00:14:05.619]  They're desperately fleeing Mexico, incredibly tyrannical.
[00:14:05.619 --> 00:14:09.020]  Starvation, riots, tyranny.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:14.121]  The richest elite per capita on the planet feeding off the 99% below them.
[00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:15.442]  But they do hurt this nation.
[00:14:15.442 --> 00:14:17.982]  They come here and they drop down wages.
[00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.483]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:14:19.483 --> 00:14:27.405]  You're gonna have the 30 plus million illegal aliens, Mexico in a big recession, pushing more of them up here, driving it down even deeper.
[00:14:28.214 --> 00:14:33.176]  Getting all the free health care that the hospitals give.
[00:14:33.176 --> 00:14:34.857]  Oh, did you know hospitals from L.A.
[00:14:34.857 --> 00:14:39.319]  to Dallas, Texas have been instructed for decades to give free health care to illegal aliens?
[00:14:39.319 --> 00:14:42.500]  That's what's bankrupting them, and the schools, and everything else.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:54.045]  All of this compounding, and hundreds of unfunded federal mandates on the states, ordering the states to do this, ordering the states to do that.
[00:14:54.045 --> 00:14:55.426]  Fifty-something million people
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.521]  On Social Security and that number growing, growing every day.
[00:14:59.521 --> 00:15:04.523]  It'll be $60 million by the end of the decade.
[00:15:04.523 --> 00:15:05.484]  All of it compacting.
[00:15:05.484 --> 00:15:06.404]  That's right.
[00:15:06.404 --> 00:15:07.685]  $60 million on Social Security.
[00:15:07.685 --> 00:15:11.446]  $10 million more in just two years!
[00:15:11.446 --> 00:15:16.668]  And their checks had its value cut in half in the last four years just with the inflation we had before.
[00:15:16.668 --> 00:15:18.189]  Now it's accelerating.
[00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:21.330]  Now it's deepening.
[00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.831]  The inflation is getting worse compounded per year.
[00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:26.838]  You add that into the equation.
[00:15:26.838 --> 00:15:31.599]  You add a world recession that's beginning.
[00:15:31.599 --> 00:15:38.282]  Man, I got news stacked to the rafters and I'm not even... I'm looking at article number one here, London Independent.
[00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:45.164]  Bread, milk, eggs, prices spiked, draining locals' wallets.
[00:15:45.164 --> 00:15:47.225]  China's stocks tumbled 4.1% to new 11-month low.
[00:15:47.225 --> 00:15:47.405]  Reuters
[00:15:50.228 --> 00:16:02.751]  China's main stock index tumbled 4.13% to a new 11-month closing low today after a central bank repeated its commitment to tight monetary policy.
[00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:05.552]  So we're seeing restrictions in credit.
[00:16:05.552 --> 00:16:07.333]  The same thing in Europe, same thing in the U.S.
[00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:09.253]  Now let's explain what's happening.
[00:16:09.253 --> 00:16:19.436]  The big central banks and the private banks they own are being given unlimited liquidity, unlimited funds over
[00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:25.711]  Two hundred billion dollars a month, and we're now eight months into this.
[00:16:25.711 --> 00:16:30.913]  It's trillions!
[00:16:30.913 --> 00:16:37.715]  And that's just government and sovereign wealth funds pumping that in.
[00:16:37.715 --> 00:16:45.658]  The companies are taking the pension funds that were left, that were already fully leveraged, but just taking the scraps, trying to prop things up.
[00:16:45.658 --> 00:16:49.780]  Full bailouts of the Fortune 100 banks and brokerage firms.
[00:16:52.116 --> 00:16:55.938]  Who'd bought into real companies and have now infected those.
[00:16:55.938 --> 00:17:10.327]  Bought into real commodities, holders, bought into manufacturing, bought into military, bought into entertainment, communications, mining.
[00:17:10.327 --> 00:17:13.269]  The leveraging is in the billions to one.
[00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:17.832]  It just... It's total la-la land.
[00:17:17.832 --> 00:17:18.893]  It's not even real.
[00:17:18.893 --> 00:17:20.594]  It's just total fantasy.
[00:17:21.844 --> 00:17:27.048]  Unlimited liquidity for all of them, with you, the taxpayer, that's going to fit the bill.
[00:17:27.048 --> 00:17:37.756]  Not just paying in taxes to pay it off, but also in the destruction of your dollar.
[00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:38.557]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:41.119]  Ambassador says NAFTA, no matter what,
[00:17:43.283 --> 00:17:49.326]  The North American Free Trade Agreement will stand regardless of who wins the coming presidential election south of the border.
[00:17:49.326 --> 00:17:51.487]  The United States Ambassador to Canada said Monday.
[00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:59.810]  David Wilkins told a trade group in Canada that NAFTA survival does not depend on whether Democrats or Republicans control the White House.
[00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.652]  Despite all the political rhetoric, in my opinion, our relationship will remain strong.
[00:18:03.652 --> 00:18:06.373]  There will be no major changes because they own all the candidates, I would add.
[00:18:07.233 --> 00:18:10.335]  To our trade policies with our friend Canada, Sid Wilkins.
[00:18:10.335 --> 00:18:14.258]  Yeah, the Canadians, the Mexicans, the people in the U.S., none of the people.
[00:18:14.258 --> 00:18:16.719]  I mean, it's 90 plus percent in every poll.
[00:18:16.719 --> 00:18:18.220]  Don't like NAFTA.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.162]  I've seen polls of 99 percent.
[00:18:20.162 --> 00:18:22.203]  And the government just says, shut up!
[00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:26.926]  Have you noticed we have armed, military-trained police, civilian?
[00:18:26.926 --> 00:18:28.427]  Shut up!
[00:18:28.427 --> 00:18:29.748]  We're taking your house.
[00:18:29.748 --> 00:18:33.371]  Go to the tent city, scum!
[00:18:33.371 --> 00:18:35.472]  You don't like the destruction of your company?
[00:18:35.472 --> 00:18:36.533]  Of your country?
[00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:36.993]  Shut up!
[00:18:37.785 --> 00:18:39.527]  Just shut up!
[00:18:39.527 --> 00:18:41.108]  Sit down and shut up!
[00:18:41.108 --> 00:18:45.293]  This is gonna hurt!
[00:18:45.293 --> 00:18:49.537]  Just remember, this is your God's police when your grandma's moving in with you.
[00:18:49.537 --> 00:18:56.304]  David Wilkins told her, of course she won't let anyone move in, you'll just stick her in a government facility and she'll die of bed sores a few months later.
[00:18:56.304 --> 00:18:56.624]  That's all.
[00:18:57.608 --> 00:19:00.190]  You'll beat the sports bar, flexin' your muscles.
[00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.554]  David Wilkins told a trade group, it doesn't matter what the American people want.
[00:19:03.554 --> 00:19:07.958]  Our relationship is so strong and so deep that it's not dependent on which party is in power.
[00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:11.181]  Either in Canada or the U.S., our relationship transcends politics.
[00:19:11.181 --> 00:19:13.463]  Yeah, the private corporations run us and they've merged us.
[00:19:13.463 --> 00:19:14.904]  Go read the SPP documents.
[00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:21.811]  The comments come after a debate in Ohio last month where Democratic candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if it wasn't
[00:19:23.812 --> 00:19:24.672]  Renegotiated.
[00:19:24.672 --> 00:19:25.952]  Now here's the scam.
[00:19:25.952 --> 00:19:27.913]  They're going to come in and they're going to say they're going to fix it.
[00:19:27.913 --> 00:19:29.413]  They're going to make it worse.
[00:19:29.413 --> 00:19:32.434]  They're going to sign even deeper agreements.
[00:19:32.434 --> 00:19:32.934]  Understand?
[00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:36.734]  Just like with banking.
[00:19:36.734 --> 00:19:38.515]  The Federal Reserve designs it.
[00:19:38.515 --> 00:19:41.135]  We tell you three years before it happens what they were going to do.
[00:19:41.135 --> 00:19:43.155]  They issue the liquidity.
[00:19:43.155 --> 00:19:44.336]  People know credit.
[00:19:44.336 --> 00:19:50.257]  Then they pose as a savior and nationalize the entire economy for them.
[00:19:50.257 --> 00:19:51.277]  Oh, they're going to fix NAFTA.
[00:19:51.277 --> 00:19:51.717]  Don't worry.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.022]  And NAU it all the way.
[00:19:56.022 --> 00:19:58.704]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:58.704 --> 00:20:08.171]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:08.171 --> 00:20:15.276]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:15.996 --> 00:20:21.983]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.983 --> 00:20:32.775]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:33.636 --> 00:20:34.117]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:57.719 --> 00:20:59.480]  A New World Order.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:04.362]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:21:04.362 --> 00:21:07.204]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:07.204 --> 00:21:09.985]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:13.166]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:13.166 --> 00:21:20.490]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:23.516 --> 00:21:28.960]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.682]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:32.682 --> 00:21:35.404]  The Old America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:35.404 --> 00:21:36.565]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:36.565 --> 00:21:37.365]  They're not after money.
[00:21:37.365 --> 00:21:38.626]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:38.626 --> 00:21:39.607]  They're after power.
[00:21:39.607 --> 00:21:40.768]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:22:42.623 --> 00:22:45.845]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[00:22:45.845 --> 00:22:48.346]  This product is also great for pets and animals.

[00:23:45.185 --> 00:23:47.827]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:53.130]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:24:17.903 --> 00:24:28.448]  Yeah, that's how the scam works.
[00:24:28.448 --> 00:24:34.270]  They say, oh, the Supreme Court's going to rule you of a Second Amendment, but they have a right to ban all your guns.
[00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.951]  Oh, oh, they're pro-gun.
[00:24:35.951 --> 00:24:39.012]  Here, I'm handing mine in.
[00:24:39.012 --> 00:24:42.634]  That's their favorite operation.
[00:24:42.634 --> 00:24:46.056]  Mukasey, the corrupt little judge involved in 9-11 cover-ups and
[00:24:47.916 --> 00:24:58.199]  His own officers filed complaints, people that guarded him, and he made the federal marshals clean toilets at his house and get his wife's groceries and basically grovel to him.
[00:24:58.199 --> 00:24:59.839]  It just shows a little slimebag he is.
[00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:03.721]  The guy's completely rich and won't even hire his own maid.
[00:25:03.721 --> 00:25:15.864]  He would make the, uh... When the federal marshals would get first class tickets to fly with him, but Mukasey would have to pay for his own, he would make them switch him out with him, which is illegal.
[00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.091]  Let's just show a little petty dirtbag crook.
[00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:25.893]  Mukasey admits government knew of call about 9-11 before 9-11.
[00:25:25.893 --> 00:25:32.374]  Echelon's spy network would have intercepted and cataloged all transmissions.
[00:25:32.374 --> 00:25:41.117]  The guy was speaking before a big group of people and he came out and admitted that Echelon, the NSA, was listening to it.
[00:25:41.117 --> 00:25:44.898]  Then he said, oh, but the law didn't let us track it in the U.S.
[00:25:44.898 --> 00:25:45.918]  That's a complete lie.
[00:25:46.656 --> 00:25:56.058]  Under the FISA court, they just, after the fact, months later, they have to come and get blanket authorizations.
[00:25:56.058 --> 00:25:56.919]  And what was the numbers?
[00:25:56.919 --> 00:26:03.480]  Out of 18,000 plus, they'd refuse less than 10 in decades?
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.201]  They basically never refuse them.
[00:26:06.201 --> 00:26:11.582]  Less than 10 times out of 18,000 and something?
[00:26:11.582 --> 00:26:13.122]  It's not even a warrant.
[00:26:13.122 --> 00:26:15.583]  But see, first, they set up decades ago something that
[00:26:19.156 --> 00:26:23.477]  Already destroyed the Fourth Amendment.
[00:26:23.477 --> 00:26:25.258]  You know, but you go to a judge later.
[00:26:25.258 --> 00:26:25.998]  But that's not enough.
[00:26:25.998 --> 00:26:35.700]  He gets up and lies like the public are complete morons, and I guess they are, so... But all of us aren't.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:41.082]  And he gets up... In fact, let me just read the quote.
[00:26:41.082 --> 00:26:44.703]  Quote, we knew that there had been a call from someplace.
[00:26:46.365 --> 00:26:51.027]  That was known to be a safe house in Afghanistan, and that we knew that it came to the United States.
[00:26:51.027 --> 00:26:56.149]  We didn't know precisely where it went, reports the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:26:56.149 --> 00:27:06.534]  Mukasey is then reported to have grimaced, swallowed hard, and seemed to tear up as he reflected on the weakness in America's anti-terrorism strategy prior to the 2001 attacks.
[00:27:06.534 --> 00:27:07.194]  We've got 3,000 people who
[00:27:11.852 --> 00:27:17.877]  Went to work that day and didn't come home to show for that, he said, struggling to maintain his composure.
[00:27:17.877 --> 00:27:24.922]  This is the guy that helped cover up how the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, gave them the detonators for the first World Trade Center attack.
[00:27:24.922 --> 00:27:27.644]  This is the guy who helped cover up the insider trading on 9-11.
[00:27:27.644 --> 00:27:37.072]  I mean, if we went into how bad Mukasey is, it would take hours, but you can go look it up for yourself.
[00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:40.895]  Just absolute, complete, poppycock theater
[00:27:42.003 --> 00:27:45.046]  From Mr. McKaysey.
[00:27:45.046 --> 00:27:51.131]  And Paul Watson has a big article detailing the history of this today up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:27:51.131 --> 00:27:57.036]  How it's admitted the NSA was watching them all, that Mohammed Adda and others went to the Malaysian terror summit.
[00:27:58.437 --> 00:28:01.238]  Mr. Springman, the head of the embassy and others wouldn't let him back in.
[00:28:01.238 --> 00:28:02.219]  They were ordered to let him in.
[00:28:02.219 --> 00:28:03.659]  They knew where they were staying.
[00:28:03.659 --> 00:28:11.943]  The FBI was paying for their houses, their cars, their credit cards in Florida, San Diego, Dallas, Chicago, Minneapolis, St.
[00:28:11.943 --> 00:28:13.563]  Paul.
[00:28:13.563 --> 00:28:14.384]  They were U.S.
[00:28:14.384 --> 00:28:16.765]  government assets, bare minimum.
[00:28:16.765 --> 00:28:17.505]  Trained at U.S.
[00:28:17.505 --> 00:28:19.286]  bases.
[00:28:19.286 --> 00:28:20.886]  That's all admitted.
[00:28:20.886 --> 00:28:22.467]  But then New Casey's up.
[00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:24.848]  We might have intercepted a call from
[00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.991]  Afghanistan.
[00:28:29.991 --> 00:28:32.893]  But we weren't able to track it because we didn't have the tools.
[00:28:32.893 --> 00:28:37.855]  I'm crying.
[00:28:37.855 --> 00:28:41.637]  We need to get rid of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:28:41.637 --> 00:28:45.979]  Al-Qaeda's gonna get at me.
[00:28:45.979 --> 00:28:52.342]  They were trained at the Pensacola Base and the Defense Language School.
[00:28:52.342 --> 00:28:54.003]  And up in Oklahoma.
[00:28:55.934 --> 00:29:12.017]  And then the spook, Nick Berg, who later got his head sawed off at a staged event, with white-skinned Anglos chopping his head off at a staged event.
[00:29:12.017 --> 00:29:16.758]  He gave a laptop to one of the lead hijackers in Oklahoma.
[00:29:16.758 --> 00:29:21.478]  He was at a training base where the Daily Oklahoma reported, but they just say it's an accident.
[00:29:21.478 --> 00:29:21.938]  Al Qaeda.
[00:29:27.069 --> 00:29:29.251]  Disgusting, Mukasey!
[00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:34.536]  We know you're in with the murderers, and it's disgusting what you've done.
[00:29:34.536 --> 00:29:36.678]  Stop bombing us, Mukasey!
[00:29:36.678 --> 00:29:40.041]  Stop killing us so you can pose as our savior!
[00:29:40.041 --> 00:29:45.345]  Stop being a murderer!
[00:29:45.345 --> 00:29:46.747]  We're on the march.
[00:29:46.747 --> 00:29:49.269]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:51.951]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.202 --> 00:29:57.244]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:29:57.244 --> 00:30:00.547]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:30:00.547 --> 00:30:05.512]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:08.395]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:30:08.395 --> 00:30:15.242]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:30:15.442 --> 00:30:21.530]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.573]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[00:30:23.573 --> 00:30:27.919]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:32.445]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong.
[00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:34.106]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:30:34.106 --> 00:30:36.248]  You can now get the most important package ever,
[00:30:58.953 --> 00:30:59.353]  We're good to go.
[00:31:14.841 --> 00:31:18.764]  Two books that combined over a thousand pages and other information.
[00:31:18.764 --> 00:31:22.106]  Order now at our website, mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[00:31:22.106 --> 00:31:26.328]  That's mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[00:31:26.328 --> 00:31:28.690]  The last word monastery spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:29.551]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[00:31:29.551 --> 00:31:29.831]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[00:31:29.831 --> 00:31:31.832]  Or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.
[00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:49.262]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:31:49.262 --> 00:31:54.024]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:31:54.024 --> 00:31:58.285]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:31:58.285 --> 00:32:01.866]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:01.866 --> 00:32:05.347]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:05.606 --> 00:32:09.008]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:09.008 --> 00:32:14.370]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we've seen.
[00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:24.115]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:32:24.115 --> 00:32:25.495]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:32:25.495 --> 00:32:30.898]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:32:31.418 --> 00:32:35.920]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.461]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:32:37.461 --> 00:32:41.382]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:32:41.382 --> 00:32:42.142]  That toll-free number again?
[00:32:42.142 --> 00:32:42.202]  1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:15.794 --> 00:33:21.316]  By the way, I don't come on and call the Attorney General a murderer lightly.
[00:33:21.316 --> 00:33:29.458]  He clearly covered up, making him an accessory after the fact, to the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, making him an accessory.
[00:33:29.458 --> 00:33:37.241]  He clearly covered up many other events and helped frame Patsy's in New York.
[00:33:37.241 --> 00:33:41.142]  He's definitely an operative of the criminal crew
[00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:56.327]  I want to be clear here that Hollywood, whether it's the Bourne Ultimatum or conspiracy theories put out by
[00:33:57.446 --> 00:33:58.106]  Mel Gibson.
[00:33:58.106 --> 00:34:11.309]  They always make it that it's a rogue group in government that's doing it, and the rest of the government's good, and the guys on top are good, and they come and they always, you know, defeat the lower-level echelon that's engaged in the crime.
[00:34:11.309 --> 00:34:15.890]  The drug dealing, the murder, the torture, the mind control, the child kidnapping.
[00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:20.351]  All the things they put in Hollywood now because it's been in the newspapers.
[00:34:20.351 --> 00:34:22.952]  But they always phrase it as if it's a small group doing it.
[00:34:22.952 --> 00:34:25.653]  Now, in a way, that's true.
[00:34:25.653 --> 00:34:26.993]  It is a small group doing it.
[00:34:28.277 --> 00:34:30.598]  But it's not a subgroup.
[00:34:30.598 --> 00:34:31.778]  It's the group on the top.
[00:34:31.778 --> 00:34:33.579]  It is a compartmentalized group.
[00:34:33.579 --> 00:34:36.080]  It is a small group.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.601]  99% of FBI agents are not involved in narcotics trafficking.
[00:34:40.601 --> 00:34:47.624]  Probably 75-80% of CIA's not involved in narcotics trafficking.
[00:34:47.624 --> 00:34:54.366]  95% of the CIA's not involved in the sex trade and snuff films and all the things that fit into that.
[00:34:54.366 --> 00:34:56.547]  But there is a group that is and it's right at the top.
[00:34:59.136 --> 00:35:07.841]  And every time, it's the people at the top running this, and they have trusted little cadres that carry out their operations.
[00:35:07.841 --> 00:35:24.371]  The problem is that they don't have a big enough army to carry out the 9-11 attacks they'd like to carry out and pose as saviors to run the larger kidnapping ops, to even run the murder for hire.
[00:35:24.371 --> 00:35:25.892]  I mean, they just don't have enough hitmen.
[00:35:28.539 --> 00:35:32.561]  To go out and do the long knives like they'd like to.
[00:35:32.561 --> 00:35:35.502]  Because believe it, the first group they're going to purge is their own people.
[00:35:35.502 --> 00:35:38.763]  That will come and then it will be people like me.
[00:35:38.763 --> 00:35:40.844]  Folks think Alex Jones will be in the first wave.
[00:35:40.844 --> 00:35:42.044]  Nope.
[00:35:42.044 --> 00:35:45.565]  I will be in the second or third wave if they go to full martial law.
[00:35:45.565 --> 00:35:50.107]  It will be FBI deputy directors and it will be CIA deputy directors.
[00:35:50.107 --> 00:35:57.610]  It'll be anybody that didn't play ball or who wasn't corrupt and totally evil or who was corrupt and evil but made somebody mad
[00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:02.713]  And, you know, cheated some underling who's now above them.
[00:36:02.713 --> 00:36:07.897]  Or someone who was parallel to them.
[00:36:07.897 --> 00:36:09.739]  And is now above them.
[00:36:09.739 --> 00:36:17.544]  Tyranny, in which I've studied, is not a happy place for really anybody, including the very people at the top.
[00:36:17.544 --> 00:36:19.626]  And that's why the elites have been smarter in the past.
[00:36:19.626 --> 00:36:23.409]  They were into soft power, which is real power.
[00:36:24.617 --> 00:36:33.423]  But, uh, the people running things just can't help themselves, and psychopaths always want to get caught, so they always get reckless, and they're getting reckless, they're getting wild.
[00:36:33.423 --> 00:36:51.035]  You know, you study most psychopaths, they'll kill one woman every six months, do it very handily, be very careful to do it on quiet roads, to not be seen, to get rid of the evidence, and five years later, they're going crazy, killing three women in one night, running around drunk, and they finally get pulled over by the cops and get caught.
[00:36:51.707 --> 00:37:07.114]  And we've kind of reached that phase of just driving around drunk with dead women in the trunk, the globalists are driving around with women's lipstick on and a red wig, like Ronald McDonald, and I just... God help us!
[00:37:07.114 --> 00:37:07.834]  God help us!
[00:37:07.834 --> 00:37:10.295]  I mean, we got total psychopaths running everything!
[00:37:12.924 --> 00:37:14.786]  You think I'm happy this is going on?
[00:37:14.786 --> 00:37:19.069]  You think it's fun to come up here and talk about this and endanger my life every day?
[00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:21.771]  I wish this wasn't the case every day.
[00:37:21.771 --> 00:37:27.355]  I want to stop them from setting off nukes or releasing bird flu.
[00:37:27.355 --> 00:37:33.080]  You know, what has so many of the top futurists and multi-billionaire computer company owners say?
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.382]  They talk about how the elite are suicidal nihilists.
[00:37:36.382 --> 00:37:40.045]  We cover this in Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:37:40.045 --> 00:37:42.607]  You need to find out what suicidal nihilists are.
[00:37:44.932 --> 00:37:49.075]  See, they want to go on willing.
[00:37:49.075 --> 00:38:08.308]  And when there's no more willing to their lives, when they can't continue to force their will on something and do something reckless and daring, then they just start killing people en masse and blowing things up.
[00:38:08.308 --> 00:38:10.329]  Oh, I never said the New World Order were cowards.
[00:38:10.329 --> 00:38:11.650]  I never said they were stupid either.
[00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.752]  They're just absolutely demon-possessed.
[00:38:15.456 --> 00:38:17.437]  Even if you don't believe in God, there's no other way to describe them.
[00:38:17.437 --> 00:38:20.238]  I mean, what do you call this?
[00:38:20.238 --> 00:38:24.519]  They're incredibly daring, incredibly smart, incredibly wicked.
[00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:31.902]  To even try to grasp their dark intellect is... It makes you believe in God.
[00:38:31.902 --> 00:38:36.523]  Because then you realize, when you really study it and really meditate on it, that there's something else to it.
[00:38:36.523 --> 00:38:38.404]  There's some other force there.
[00:38:39.364 --> 00:38:43.666]  And some would argue, well, that's the evil people's group consciousness, you know, working in tandem.
[00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:45.307]  The scientific studies show that is real.
[00:38:45.307 --> 00:38:48.688]  It's like radio waves are being broadcast by our minds.
[00:38:48.688 --> 00:38:51.809]  No one understands it, but it's real.
[00:38:51.809 --> 00:38:55.831]  Or you go to the next level and say it is God and the devil.
[00:38:55.831 --> 00:39:04.154]  I tend to believe that is the case, but whatever name you put on it, however you conceptualize it, there's something going on here.
[00:39:04.154 --> 00:39:05.815]  There's some guiding force.
[00:39:08.899 --> 00:39:23.143]  It's almost like a dimension to evil, a bending of the light, a dark genius, a dark logic, a wicked mathematics.
[00:39:23.143 --> 00:39:31.325]  Because you start studying the subtleties and the perfection of how their wickedness works in tandem.
[00:39:31.325 --> 00:39:34.506]  It's kind of like a fire ant.
[00:39:34.506 --> 00:39:37.887]  I went over to my parents' house a couple nights ago and they got a pool and I was swimming.
[00:39:38.439 --> 00:39:40.400]  And some fire ants have gotten in the pool.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:52.486]  They're actually a water, semi-water amphibious ant from Brazil, but I digress, that came here in the 50s into Houston port in wood, but side issue.
[00:39:52.486 --> 00:40:02.290]  And I got a couple of them on me, and then they simultaneously, one stung me on the chest, one stung me on the arm, one stung me on the leg, simultaneously.
[00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:06.812]  Of course, that's a pheromone they're releasing, but simultaneously they all stung me.
[00:40:06.812 --> 00:40:07.533]  That's how they operate.
[00:40:08.666 --> 00:40:10.547]  They're simultaneously staying.
[00:40:10.547 --> 00:40:13.009]  So whatever it is, that's how the New World Order works in tandem.
[00:40:13.009 --> 00:40:19.953]  It's like it's a hive entity, a hive mind.
[00:40:19.953 --> 00:40:22.935]  Alright, I'm really digressing now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:22.935 --> 00:40:31.840]  Let me get into what I promised to spend some time on today, and then we're going to spend a lot of time on this in the third hour.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.262]  The best way to do this is to first off say this.
[00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:37.490]  There is not a finite supply of water.
[00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:41.851]  It is renewable.
[00:40:41.851 --> 00:40:47.972]  75% of the Earth's surface is saltwater.
[00:40:47.972 --> 00:40:50.893]  Another 2% or so is freshwater.
[00:40:50.893 --> 00:40:54.214]  Above ground 1%, below ground 1%, but that's what's been discovered.
[00:40:54.214 --> 00:40:55.414]  It's probably even more.
[00:40:55.414 --> 00:40:58.455]  The Earth's probably more like 80% water on the surface, but
[00:41:00.811 --> 00:41:04.392]  Water is renewable if you're living out in the desert or you're living somewhere.
[00:41:04.392 --> 00:41:08.073]  Yes, you do have shortages or mega-cities built in the desert or off the desert like L.A.
[00:41:08.073 --> 00:41:09.253]  are going to have problems.
[00:41:09.253 --> 00:41:12.134]  But overall, water is totally renewable.
[00:41:12.134 --> 00:41:22.617]  And the Globalist wrote documents 30 years ago saying they were going to propagandize you that it wasn't, with reasonable things like, you know, don't water during the day, water at night.
[00:41:22.617 --> 00:41:22.877]  And then,
[00:41:24.705 --> 00:41:27.248]  Only water on Sundays at night.
[00:41:27.248 --> 00:41:30.272]  And then, oh, we're going to fine you and now we're going to arrest you and see.
[00:41:30.272 --> 00:41:34.156]  It's about training you to do what they say.
[00:41:34.156 --> 00:41:37.961]  Or England, where it rains about 120 days out of the year.
[00:41:37.961 --> 00:41:42.126]  Heavily.
[00:41:42.126 --> 00:41:44.729]  They are going to make you pay exorbitant prices and it's all about control.
[00:41:49.481 --> 00:41:50.882]  And it's the same thing with diamonds.
[00:41:50.882 --> 00:41:53.504]  They are low on the totem pole of semi-precious.
[00:41:53.504 --> 00:41:55.625]  They're not even high on the scale of precious.
[00:41:55.625 --> 00:41:58.747]  They're junk.
[00:41:58.747 --> 00:42:01.769]  The problem is they're geographically isolated.
[00:42:01.769 --> 00:42:11.636]  Arkansas, Furea, Canada, Brazil, Africa, Australia, and one family owns and controls over 90% of it.
[00:42:14.591 --> 00:42:18.476]  But they created scarcity there, and they tell you diamonds are scarce, you'll believe it.
[00:42:18.476 --> 00:42:21.699]  And they tell you water's scarce, you'll believe it.
[00:42:21.699 --> 00:42:24.242]  And they can control you.
[00:42:24.242 --> 00:42:28.407]  But my point is, they're saying water's a big crisis, but that's what threatens us is the water.
[00:42:28.407 --> 00:42:33.253]  Or they say carbon dioxide, one of the basic two building blocks of all life on Earth.
[00:42:35.678 --> 00:42:39.502]  That in previous times in our history has been 14 times higher.
[00:42:39.502 --> 00:42:43.265]  Scientists believe an optimum from studies they've done in controlled environments.
[00:42:43.265 --> 00:42:46.008]  These have been done over the last 200 years.
[00:42:46.008 --> 00:42:48.410]  One of the most studied things out there in agriculture.
[00:42:50.871 --> 00:43:09.059]  Is that you can have ten times the level of carbon dioxide and it just makes plants live longer, grow better, it creates more oxygen, humans, all forms of animal life like higher oxygen, the earth is actually in an oxygen and carbon dioxide starved mode.
[00:43:09.059 --> 00:43:17.803]  One of the lowest ever recorded, they've got high scores going back 500,000 years by the way, one of the lowest ever recorded oxygen slash
[00:43:18.809 --> 00:43:28.276]  Carbon dioxide levels, and they've got people running in fear, hyperventilating, I mean just freaking out over carbon dioxide.
[00:43:28.276 --> 00:43:32.840]  That it's gonna heat us up, it's gonna kill us, it's all over.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:43.728]  And even if you believe all of that, put out by the New World Order to set up new systems to micromanage and control you and tax you and tax all human activity and life, carbon footprint,
[00:43:44.631 --> 00:43:48.873]  Even if you believe the fraud, there's solutions of putting restrictions on Europe and the U.S.
[00:43:48.873 --> 00:43:49.414]  only.
[00:43:49.414 --> 00:43:52.636]  No restrictions on China, India, and 160 other countries.
[00:43:52.636 --> 00:43:59.400]  It will actually move it from cleaner societies to the ones with no controls, and will actually boost it, and there's major studies on that.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.940]  So there, the whole debate's over.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:05.403]  My point is, you're freaking out over that.
[00:44:05.403 --> 00:44:08.565]  Meanwhile, I've talked a lot about this, but we're gonna do whole shows on this.
[00:44:09.884 --> 00:44:20.656]  There are thousands of factories randomly splicing DNA of pigs and monkeys and humans and insects and plants and insects and 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 100, 200 different cross-species injections with
[00:44:24.972 --> 00:44:43.783]  DNA guns that fire it into the bacteria and fire viruses in, and it's already given rise to super viruses, and it's already given rise to super bacteria, and there's already been all sorts of releases and crises and problems and cover-ups and murders of hundreds and hundreds of microbiologists.
[00:44:43.783 --> 00:44:52.849]  And the very DNA of the planet, the true biosphere, is being altered in a way it's never been in its slow development in the past.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:02.402]  And any day, this can release a super virus that kills 20%, 100%, who knows?
[00:45:02.402 --> 00:45:07.644]  I mean, there are governments working on mousepox that kill 100% of mammals that come in contact with it.
[00:45:07.644 --> 00:45:18.828]  And that's being done in Level 2 labs in Australia, the US, England, and God knows where, and the university there, what, six years ago, in Australia, put the exact
[00:45:19.517 --> 00:45:28.099]  Genetic code and how to engineer a mousepox for any mammal that has 100% kill rate.
[00:45:28.099 --> 00:45:38.022]  And the government accidentally, I'm joking when I say that, but they say accidentally put out the code for that.
[00:45:38.022 --> 00:45:41.423]  Exactly how to do it.
[00:45:41.423 --> 00:45:43.884]  Very easily.
[00:45:43.884 --> 00:45:47.445]  Now you begin to realize what we face while you run around
[00:45:48.545 --> 00:45:52.229]  Jibbering about carbon dioxide, okay?
[00:45:52.229 --> 00:45:55.071]  Now, let me move on to something else here.
[00:45:55.071 --> 00:45:55.992]  This is the New York Times.
[00:45:55.992 --> 00:45:57.534]  I've been talking about this since Sunday.
[00:45:57.534 --> 00:45:59.976]  We have a guest on in the third hour on the subject.
[00:45:59.976 --> 00:46:04.220]  Asking a judge to save the world, and maybe a whole lot more.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:05.221]  More fighting in Iraq.
[00:46:05.221 --> 00:46:06.682]  Somalian chaos.
[00:46:06.682 --> 00:46:08.884]  People in this country can't afford their mortgages.
[00:46:08.884 --> 00:46:11.347]  And in some places now, they can't even afford rice.
[00:46:13.166 --> 00:46:22.974]  None of this, nor the rest of the grimness on the front page today will matter a bit, though, if the two men... Now, this is... They act like it's two men in this article.
[00:46:22.974 --> 00:46:30.400]  It's the former head and a physicist of the Royal Society of England, the most prestigious I know by the world.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.081]  It's a new scientist scientist.
[00:46:32.081 --> 00:46:38.506]  It's hundreds of prominent physicists.
[00:46:38.506 --> 00:46:39.787]  But see how they minimize that there?
[00:46:42.145 --> 00:46:49.686]  None of this will matter a bit, though, if two men pursuing a lawsuit in federal court in Hawaii turn out to be right.
[00:46:49.686 --> 00:46:59.948]  They think a giant particle accelerator that will begin smashing protons together outside Geneva this summer might produce a black hole or something else that might spell the end of the Earth and maybe the universe.
[00:46:59.948 --> 00:47:10.090]  Now, it was the same physicist and a bunch of other physicists that theorized that superconducting supercolliders would produce limited black holes that they hoped would decay
[00:47:12.034 --> 00:47:24.882]  And in most cases they believe in the equations will decay and fall apart before they get enough energy to go to mass and begin sucking the earth in.
[00:47:24.882 --> 00:47:34.408]  You see, you split an atom, they start reacting in the uranium or plutonium, and then they start violently expanding and you have an explosion.
[00:47:34.408 --> 00:47:38.090]  That's 1900 technology, Max Planck and others.
[00:47:39.076 --> 00:47:52.601]  They theoretized their equations, laid it out, Einstein added to it, popularized it, but it was Planck and others, the German scientists, that are admitted to be the ones that developed it, and then in the forties they made A-bombs with it.
[00:47:52.601 --> 00:47:56.843]  1945 was how many years ago?
[00:47:56.843 --> 00:47:58.303]  Sixty-plus?
[00:47:58.303 --> 00:47:59.164]  A-bombs?
[00:47:59.164 --> 00:47:59.824]  Okay.
[00:47:59.824 --> 00:48:01.725]  So see, this is the opposite.
[00:48:01.725 --> 00:48:07.587]  This is a bomb that sucks everything into it and explodes inward.
[00:48:08.928 --> 00:48:18.036]  Much smaller than the head of a pen, when it sucked in the entire solar system.
[00:48:18.036 --> 00:48:19.958]  Understand?
[00:48:19.958 --> 00:48:20.398]  See, it's 2008.
[00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:25.002]  This isn't 1945 with an A-bomb.
[00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:27.584]  This is black holes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:27.584 --> 00:48:28.725]  And guess what?
[00:48:28.725 --> 00:48:30.987]  Now they've made black holes.
[00:48:30.987 --> 00:48:36.692]  See, first they were worried about it, and the equation showed it would happen, and then Hawking came out, a physicist,
[00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:42.122]  Who they've kind of popularized, and he is a smart guy, but he's admitted he's been wrong a few times, but he was right about this.
[00:48:42.122 --> 00:48:45.863]  He said, well, don't worry, when they make black holes in these, they're gonna fall apart.
[00:48:45.863 --> 00:48:47.383]  They're gonna decay.
[00:48:47.383 --> 00:48:50.103]  Most of the time.
[00:48:50.103 --> 00:48:52.224]  And they do decay.
[00:48:52.224 --> 00:48:58.385]  But the equations show that there's gonna be, that there is a chance, a good chance, that they will not decay.
[00:48:58.385 --> 00:48:59.265]  That they'll get going.
[00:48:59.265 --> 00:49:01.806]  It's kind of like when you're starting a fire.
[00:49:01.806 --> 00:49:02.826]  Then it'll catch fire.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.880]  And then no more acting cool?
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.181]  No more Illuminati ceremonies?
[00:49:09.181 --> 00:49:11.822]  No more fun?
[00:49:11.822 --> 00:49:13.703]  No more acting tough?
[00:49:13.703 --> 00:49:17.084]  No more parading around with your FBI badges?
[00:49:17.084 --> 00:49:24.866]  No more wearing hippie sandals and running around taking people's ranches and farms for the earth?
[00:49:24.866 --> 00:49:29.968]  This'll put a... put a kibosh on your party real fast, okay?
[00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:42.236]  Let's see, the New World Order wants to play God, and they always, they always do it!
[00:49:42.236 --> 00:49:57.505]  Close to half the scientists thought that when they detonated over a hundred hydrogen bombs in the atmospheres, in the atmosphere, in the early 1960s, in the U.S., that it was a chance it would set the atmosphere on fire.
[00:50:00.572 --> 00:50:13.623]  It didn't set the atmosphere on fire, but it did with EMP blowout transistors all over the planet randomly.
[00:50:13.623 --> 00:50:21.049]  They thought when they detonated the A-bomb, half the scientists thought it was going to set the atmosphere on fire, because our equation is showing it could.
[00:50:25.939 --> 00:50:33.742]  But instead, it's kind of like when they blow up an oil rig that's on fire, you use a bomb to blow it out, that's what happens.
[00:50:33.742 --> 00:50:36.403]  So see, they go ahead even when they think it's going to do this.
[00:50:36.403 --> 00:50:39.804]  Well, we're going to get more into this on the other side.
[00:50:39.804 --> 00:50:49.147]  This is just one, black holes are only one small facet of all the things that the math shows are probably going to happen.
[00:50:49.147 --> 00:50:52.368]  But we've got to ban carbon dioxide because plants breathe it, it's very evil.
[00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:57.291]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:50:57.291 --> 00:51:00.892]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:51:00.892 --> 00:51:03.373]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:51:03.373 --> 00:51:06.434]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:51:06.434 --> 00:51:12.216]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:51:12.216 --> 00:51:16.137]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:51:16.477 --> 00:51:21.702]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:52:55.822 --> 00:52:57.243]  It is a big idea.
[00:52:57.243 --> 00:53:00.045]  A New World Order.
[00:53:00.045 --> 00:53:04.508]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:53:04.508 --> 00:53:07.770]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:10.572]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:53:10.572 --> 00:53:13.754]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:53:13.754 --> 00:53:21.079]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:53:24.093 --> 00:53:29.537]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:53:29.537 --> 00:53:33.419]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:53:33.419 --> 00:53:35.981]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:53:35.981 --> 00:53:37.142]  Most people have no idea.
[00:53:37.142 --> 00:53:37.922]  They're not after money.
[00:53:37.922 --> 00:53:39.203]  They have all the money they need.
[00:53:39.203 --> 00:53:40.184]  They're after power.
[00:53:40.184 --> 00:53:41.345]  That's what Africa needs here.

[00:53:52.852 --> 00:53:53.913]  You have been warned.
[00:53:56.637 --> 00:54:03.589]  Yeah.
[00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:07.576]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio
[00:54:10.711 --> 00:54:14.693]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:48.272]  No, you're not if they shut off one of these black holes.
[00:54:48.272 --> 00:54:51.233]  Let me continue reading this New York Times article.
[00:55:03.416 --> 00:55:21.353]  The world physicists have spent 14 years and 8 billion dollars building the large, hardened collider in Europe, in which the collider protons will create energies and conditions last seen a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang.
[00:55:21.353 --> 00:55:22.214]  Oh, the Big Bang!
[00:55:22.214 --> 00:55:24.536]  Your equations show a Big Bang!
[00:55:24.536 --> 00:55:26.298]  Let's recreate those conditions.
[00:55:26.298 --> 00:55:27.579]  That's very smart.
[00:55:28.951 --> 00:55:41.461]  Researchers will sift the debris from the primordial reactions for clues to the nature of mass and new forces and symmetries of nature.
[00:55:41.461 --> 00:55:49.948]  But Walter L. Wagner, and don't even mention their physicist in this article, and Louis Sancho contend that scientists at the European Center for Nuclear Research
[00:55:51.005 --> 00:55:52.386]  Or C.E.R.N.
[00:55:52.386 --> 00:56:00.733]  have played down the chances that a collider could produce, among other horrors, a tiny black hole, which they say could eat the Earth.
[00:56:00.733 --> 00:56:06.017]  Now, they said this decades ago, and now they've created black holes in these, but they fall apart.
[00:56:06.017 --> 00:56:12.383]  They don't get the mass they need to start going.
[00:56:12.383 --> 00:56:18.828]  Or it could spit out something called a strangelet that would convert our planet into a shrunken, dense, dead lump
[00:56:20.467 --> 00:56:24.711]  Something called Strange Matter.
[00:56:24.711 --> 00:56:26.272]  Kind of like the core of the dead sun.
[00:56:26.272 --> 00:56:28.754]  A black dwarf, brown dwarf.
[00:56:28.754 --> 00:56:39.584]  Their suit also says the CERN, or the Super Cadetic Super Collider, has failed to provide an environmental impact statement as required under the National Environmental Policy Act.
[00:56:40.623 --> 00:56:55.010]  Although it sounds bizarre, the case touches on a serious issue that has bothered scholars and scientists in recent years, namely, how to estimate the risk of new groundbreaking experiments and who gets to decide whether or not to go ahead.
[00:56:55.010 --> 00:57:09.638]  The lawsuit filed March 21st in Federal District Court in Honolulu seeks a temporary restraining order providing and prohibiting the superconducting supercollider, or the Large Hardened Collider, from proceeding with accelerator
[00:57:10.879 --> 00:57:16.180]  Until it has produced a very detailed safety report and an environmental assessment.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:24.743]  It names the Federal Department of Energy, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the National Science Foundation Federation, and the CERN as defendants.
[00:57:24.743 --> 00:57:27.824]  Yeah, our government basically paid for this in Europe.
[00:57:27.824 --> 00:57:29.224]  As usual.
[00:57:29.224 --> 00:57:31.925]  They were building it in Texas.
[00:57:31.925 --> 00:57:37.066]  Now they've turned it into an underground anti-terror facility.
[00:57:37.066 --> 00:57:39.727]  Up in Wong, Sahatchie.
[00:57:39.727 --> 00:57:40.227]  North of here.
[00:57:40.666 --> 00:57:46.530]  Up by David J. Smith Church, Newswatch Magazine.
[00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:48.752]  Look, the whole point here, well, there's several points.
[00:57:48.752 --> 00:57:52.434]  Number one, I went and found new scientists.
[00:57:52.434 --> 00:57:56.417]  I went and found major physics organizations and societies.
[00:57:56.417 --> 00:58:01.000]  I went and found the heads of major societies across the board.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:09.846]  Quantum mechanics engineers saying, physicists saying, yeah, there is a chance that this could really cause a problem.
[00:58:10.771 --> 00:58:15.655]  We know we're dealing with incredibly explosive forces here.
[00:58:15.655 --> 00:58:21.619]  A hundred plus years ago, they came up with A-bomb equations.
[00:58:21.619 --> 00:58:24.001]  Did you know in 1916, H.G.
[00:58:24.001 --> 00:58:29.205]  Wells wrote a book where they had atomic bombs?
[00:58:29.205 --> 00:58:30.626]  You see?
[00:58:30.626 --> 00:58:30.846]  It's 2008.
[00:58:30.846 --> 00:58:36.590]  I didn't even get into the Air Force's anti-matter weapons.
[00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:38.312]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:40.186 --> 00:58:45.592]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:45.592 --> 00:58:47.013]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:47.013 --> 00:58:49.836]  A new world order.
[00:58:49.836 --> 00:58:54.381]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:54.381 --> 00:58:57.564]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:57.564 --> 00:58:59.706]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:59:00.353 --> 00:59:03.514]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:03.514 --> 00:59:10.838]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:13.871 --> 00:59:19.317]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:19.317 --> 00:59:23.201]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:23.201 --> 00:59:25.763]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:25.763 --> 00:59:26.925]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:26.925 --> 00:59:27.706]  They're not after money.
[00:59:27.706 --> 00:59:28.987]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:28.987 --> 00:59:29.968]  They're after power.
[00:59:29.968 --> 00:59:31.129]  That's what Apple needs here.

[00:59:40.578 --> 00:59:42.620]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:47.825]  You have been warned.
[00:59:47.825 --> 00:59:50.227]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:50.227 --> 00:59:52.990]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.627 --> 01:00:00.368]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:00.368 --> 01:00:01.949]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.949 --> 01:00:03.510]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:07.712]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.712 --> 01:00:13.175]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.175 --> 01:00:23.561]  Mike Rovero for his monthly visit with us, talking about the drums of war with Iran, the economy, Mukasey and his 9-11 stumble.
[01:00:23.561 --> 01:00:26.782]  Very suspicious, that's coming up.
[01:00:26.782 --> 01:00:28.003]  Finishing up with, uh,
[01:00:28.712 --> 01:00:44.558]  The subject I was just now getting into, out of the New York Times, asking a judge to save the world, where they get into superconducting super colliders and different types of systems that are similar, where a lot of the equations being put out by top physicists
[01:00:45.425 --> 01:00:49.486]  ...are showing that it could have very, very dangerous results.
[01:00:49.486 --> 01:00:52.507]  Very implosive results.
[01:00:52.507 --> 01:00:55.027]  A black hole would be implosive.
[01:00:55.027 --> 01:01:04.450]  Instead of an atomic or hydrogen explosion, you would have an implosion, a sucking in, and then as it gets more mass, dragging more into it.
[01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:12.452]  If a black hole ever gets purchased, that is, gets a toehold in one of these reactors, and I've already made quite a few, you won't feel anything.
[01:01:12.452 --> 01:01:12.792]  It will
[01:01:14.364 --> 01:01:22.650]  Suck the earth up in less than a second and it will reach the sun in just a few minutes.
[01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:25.192]  And the rest is history.
[01:01:25.192 --> 01:01:25.593]  What is it?
[01:01:25.593 --> 01:01:30.596]  Seven minutes and change to the sun?
[01:01:30.596 --> 01:01:37.882]  So, just wanted to let you know that.
[01:01:37.882 --> 01:01:39.103]  But again, this doesn't matter.
[01:01:39.764 --> 01:01:49.626]  Let's go ahead and have random genetic engineering which could cause massive problems, wipe out whole sets of life forms already doing it in the lab.
[01:01:49.626 --> 01:01:50.926]  Let's just ignore all that.
[01:01:50.926 --> 01:02:04.829]  Let's ignore the engineers that brought you A-bombs and hydrogen bombs 60-something years later, doing things billions of times more dangerous conservatively.
[01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:05.409]  New York Times
[01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:13.046]  Talking about how it could destroy the entire solar system.
[01:02:13.046 --> 01:02:15.427]  And then I thought I'd dig out some older articles.
[01:02:15.427 --> 01:02:22.289]  The Air Force gave a briefing about antimatter bombs and then reclassified it back in 2004.
[01:02:22.289 --> 01:02:28.051]  Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons.
[01:02:28.051 --> 01:02:32.653]  Program was touted publicly, then came official gag order.
[01:02:32.653 --> 01:02:35.634]  These would set off a chain reaction that would explode the Earth.
[01:02:36.221 --> 01:02:37.482]  In less than a second.
[01:02:37.482 --> 01:02:37.882]  The U.S.
[01:02:37.882 --> 01:02:51.113]  Air Force is quietly spending millions of dollars investigating ways to use a radical power source, antimatter, the eerie mirror of ordinary matter in future weapons.
[01:02:51.113 --> 01:02:56.997]  And they have isolated antimatter, they have created artificial suns, they've done it all 20, 30 years ago that we know of.
[01:02:56.997 --> 01:02:59.199]  Can you imagine what they've got underground?
[01:02:59.199 --> 01:03:01.100]  These nuts are doing this every day.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:05.904]  The admitted colliders are doing this on a daily basis around the world.
[01:03:07.077 --> 01:03:12.799]  In Japan, in Europe, in Russia, in the U.S.
[01:03:12.799 --> 01:03:14.220]  But, I mean, take Austin, Texas.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:18.521]  There's an experimental nuclear reactor in North Austin.
[01:03:18.521 --> 01:03:25.684]  They're not doing anything that dangerous compared to black holes and antimatter, but they're doing a lot of secretive stuff over there.
[01:03:25.684 --> 01:03:30.946]  And you tell the average person on the street, we've got a reactor in Austin, they'll tell you, no we don't.
[01:03:30.946 --> 01:03:34.587]  Austin's a liberal town, and you're a liar.
[01:03:36.152 --> 01:03:41.214]  You can type nuclear reactor Austin, Texas into Google and you'll be there, and it's the J.J.
[01:03:41.214 --> 01:03:43.415]  Pickle Research Center.
[01:03:43.415 --> 01:03:46.957]  Gigantic facility in North Austin guarded by men with machine guns.
[01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.217]  Doesn't exist though!
[01:03:48.217 --> 01:03:52.819]  You tell these yuppies, I mean, they're all about, oh, you said there was a reactor in Austin.
[01:03:52.819 --> 01:03:53.780]  An experimental one.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.740]  Oh, nope, doesn't exist.
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:55.441]  Shut up.
[01:03:55.441 --> 01:03:57.301]  Okay, fine, doesn't exist.
[01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:59.102]  Just had your way, didn't you?
[01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:03.984]  You won again, thanks to overwhelming delusional power.
[01:04:03.984 --> 01:04:04.985]  Invincible ignorance.
[01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:11.928]  We've even got mean phone calls before.
[01:04:11.928 --> 01:04:13.969]  You shouldn't talk about how there's a reactor!
[01:04:13.969 --> 01:04:15.971]  Terrorists might go after it!
[01:04:15.971 --> 01:04:16.891]  You mean in the government?
[01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:20.594]  No, the terrorists run the reactor.
[01:04:20.594 --> 01:04:21.935]  It's one reason to move out of Austin.
[01:04:21.935 --> 01:04:26.838]  I'm strongly considering moving, like, 80 miles outside this town.
[01:04:26.838 --> 01:04:31.901]  Then they'd call it a compound, though.
[01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:32.862]  Oh, man.
[01:04:32.862 --> 01:04:37.445]  So, uh, yeah, let's, uh, ban humans exhaling carbon dioxide.
[01:04:37.445 --> 01:04:39.967]  They're classifying it as a deadly toxic waste globally.
[01:04:41.417 --> 01:04:44.602]  Carbon dioxide, it's evil, let's ban it.
[01:04:44.602 --> 01:04:47.026]  Plants breathe it, humans exhale it.
[01:04:47.026 --> 01:04:49.431]  And then let's just not worry about all this other serious stuff.
[01:04:49.431 --> 01:04:50.552]  Genetic engineering, all the rest.
[01:04:51.235 --> 01:04:59.643]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[01:08:46.518 --> 01:08:50.240]  Mike Rivero runs the wonderful website, been around since the mid-1990s.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.683]  One of the first big sites to expose the Vince Foster murder.
[01:08:53.683 --> 01:08:57.926]  Then he was called a right-wing extremist, then exposing George Bush as a puppet.
[01:08:58.553 --> 01:09:00.034]  He's called a leftist.
[01:09:00.034 --> 01:09:03.195]  No, we're just Americans who don't like corruption.
[01:09:03.195 --> 01:09:14.421]  Now, we've got a lot of war drums, a lot of circling Iran, a lot of mashing trips, trying to... Al-Sadr for... Well, he had a ceasefire a year and a half ago, then it broke another for six months.
[01:09:14.421 --> 01:09:15.721]  He never starts it.
[01:09:15.721 --> 01:09:22.885]  The Shiites, they're always trying to then come in and sneak attack him.
[01:09:22.885 --> 01:09:25.146]  Some say it was a prelude to go into
[01:09:26.144 --> 01:09:27.244]  Uh, Iran.
[01:09:27.244 --> 01:09:37.588]  We'll talk about the war, we'll talk about the economy, we'll talk about the domestic police state, Mukasey, stumbling and saying they had NSA transmissions but that they couldn't follow them.
[01:09:37.588 --> 01:09:52.894]  In fact, cue up that, uh, John, cue up that, to the third part, that last minute, uh, with the Countdown host, Keith Uberman, where he's laying it out, saying somebody needs to basically
[01:09:53.897 --> 01:09:57.018]  Well, it's a lot of stuff happening right now.
[01:09:57.018 --> 01:09:59.499]  The economy certainly remains a very large part of the story.
[01:09:59.499 --> 01:10:01.059]  The Al-Sadr situation this last week
[01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:22.744]  I think is worth noting because, as you point out, he did not start this escalation.
[01:10:22.744 --> 01:10:24.145]  It came from Maliki.
[01:10:24.145 --> 01:10:24.906]  Now we have the U.S.
[01:10:24.906 --> 01:10:34.292]  government attempting to distance itself and saying, well, Maliki acted on his own and we didn't encourage him or authorize him to do that, which kind of reveals that the U.S.
[01:10:34.292 --> 01:10:40.696]  does still see itself as kind of running the place with any pretensions of democracy for Iraq notwithstanding.
[01:10:41.376 --> 01:10:42.377]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:10:42.377 --> 01:10:44.838]  This latest statement that the U.S.
[01:10:44.838 --> 01:10:58.484]  government was intercepting phone calls related to 9-11 before it actually happened, again, it's just more fodder for those who realize that there's something very funny about that official story.
[01:10:58.484 --> 01:11:00.985]  Let's get into McCasey first, then.
[01:11:00.985 --> 01:11:03.566]  Here is a little piece of what Keith Olbermann said last night.
[01:11:05.123 --> 01:11:07.664]  And number one, Mukasey said, what?
[01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:08.505]  Gate?
[01:11:08.505 --> 01:11:14.207]  Almost ignored in the coverage of his speech to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco pleading for telecom immunity.
[01:11:14.207 --> 01:11:20.110]  Attorney General Michael Mukasey also said, quote, before 9-11, that's the call that we didn't know about.
[01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:27.333]  We knew that there has been a call from someplace that was known to be a safe house in Afghanistan, and we knew that it came to the United States.
[01:11:27.333 --> 01:11:29.114]  We didn't know precisely where it went.
[01:11:30.529 --> 01:11:31.630]  What?
[01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:36.775]  The government knew about some phone call from a safe house in Afghanistan into the U.S.
[01:11:36.775 --> 01:11:47.145]  about 9-11, before 9-11, and even though it had the same FISA courts and the same right to act against international targets in 2001 as it does now?
[01:11:47.145 --> 01:11:48.406]  You didn't do anything about it?
[01:11:49.281 --> 01:11:51.042]  Well, this would seem to leave only two options.
[01:11:51.042 --> 01:11:59.104]  Either the Attorney General just admitted that the government for which he works is guilty of malfeasant complicity in the 9-11 attacks, or he's lying.
[01:11:59.104 --> 01:12:01.005]  I'm betting on lying.
[01:12:01.005 --> 01:12:05.246]  If not, somebody in Congress better put that man under oath right quick.
[01:12:05.246 --> 01:12:09.367]  We could send him to Gitmo, I suppose.
[01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:11.028]  Mike Rovero comments on that.
[01:12:11.028 --> 01:12:12.308]  It's getting more and more bold.
[01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:21.151]  Yeah, it is, and I would favor the Gitmo option here because unfortunately a lot of these guys, when you get them under oath, they're still going to lie anyway.
[01:12:21.151 --> 01:12:23.594]  And the bottom line is, when you get to the core issues of 9-11,
[01:12:25.094 --> 01:12:34.561]  Regardless of what the ultimate truth really is, the fact is, the existence of lies and cover-up and deceptions delegitimizes the entire country.
[01:12:34.561 --> 01:12:37.783]  And it's a scandal which nobody is going to allow out.
[01:12:37.783 --> 01:12:41.565]  So I don't even think hearings under oath are going to do anything.
[01:12:41.565 --> 01:12:44.607]  It's just more an attempt to obfuscate the situation.
[01:12:44.607 --> 01:12:47.970]  I think the bottom line is, we the people know we were lied to about 9-11.
[01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:48.310]  We accept that.
[01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:55.316]  You know, we've got to stop arguing over the minutiae and looking for more proof of what we already know to be true.
[01:12:55.316 --> 01:13:01.223]  And we have to face up to what are we going to do with the government that we have caught lying to us time and time again.
[01:13:01.223 --> 01:13:05.889]  Not just about 9-11, but about Iraq, about Al-Qaeda, about all these things.
[01:13:05.889 --> 01:13:08.492]  We have a government that lies to us with every single breath.
[01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:09.673]  It takes.
[01:13:09.673 --> 01:13:11.193]  We have to do something about that.
[01:13:11.193 --> 01:13:17.516]  I need to dig it out, but there's a new New York Times poll where more than half of New Yorkers do believe it's an inside job now.
[01:13:17.516 --> 01:13:20.658]  I mean, not just that they're being lied to, but that it's an inside job.
[01:13:20.658 --> 01:13:27.101]  And of course, we had the poll two years ago where 36% of Americans believe inside job, 60-something believe they're being lied to.
[01:13:27.101 --> 01:13:31.203]  I mean, the establishment has to know we've beaten them in the info war.
[01:13:31.203 --> 01:13:31.843]  They lied.
[01:13:31.843 --> 01:13:32.763]  We have the truth.
[01:13:32.763 --> 01:13:34.044]  The people know they're killers now.
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.281]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:13:36.281 --> 01:13:42.165]  You know, and it was easy for us to beat the mainstream media because we do have the truth on our side and the people want the truth.
[01:13:42.165 --> 01:13:45.287]  Ultimately, there's another statistic that came out this last week.
[01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:49.830]  Newspaper advertising revenues are at a 50-year low.
[01:13:49.830 --> 01:14:00.917]  People are not reading the newspapers anymore because the newspapers are full of advertising for white sales and government lies and deceptions and people just don't want to bother with that anymore.
[01:14:00.917 --> 01:14:02.058]  Well, here's another example.
[01:14:02.058 --> 01:14:03.759]  I mean, I put an ad in the paper last year
[01:14:04.876 --> 01:14:13.341]  And I paid like $350 for a tiny ad, maybe an inch and a half long, inch wide.
[01:14:13.341 --> 01:14:17.603]  And I got, I think, three phone calls and they were worthless.
[01:14:17.603 --> 01:14:19.965]  And then I put one in Craigslist for free and got like $300 plus.
[01:14:21.724 --> 01:14:22.805]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:22.805 --> 01:14:44.337]  The internet is now the high ground in the war for the minds of America, and there's a story I just put up on What Really Happened This Morning, where the government admits it is going out, it's trying to find bloggers that they can hire or bribe, or out of some misguided idea of patriotism, convince them to put out the government's version of story on their blogs.
[01:14:44.793 --> 01:14:50.195]  Uh, in order to try and get ahead of the ball on the internet and get back control of the public dialogue.
[01:14:50.195 --> 01:14:55.076]  That's not gonna work, but I mean, as long as they waste time on things that won't work, that's wonderful.
[01:14:55.076 --> 01:15:02.698]  I mean, CENTCOM admitted two years ago they have thousands of troops at their desk, and they're the ones, they're so dumb, they even use their own handles.
[01:15:03.118 --> 01:15:09.202]  And then you go find their MySpace, and there they are, and they'll openly say, I'm in the military, I can't wait to kill you.
[01:15:09.202 --> 01:15:31.717]  But they're the house slave, kind of, because the majority of troops support Ron Paul, support Liberty, it's only the little house slaves that actually sit in the propaganda belly who were selected because they were weak-minded to begin with, and so the enemy's personnel is so stupid, because you've got to be stupid to serve them, that their propaganda is so ham-fisted that it's showing everyone...
[01:15:32.998 --> 01:15:34.619]  Wonderful, Mike!
[01:15:34.619 --> 01:15:42.201]  Yeah, I agree because, you know, once the public becomes aware that these games are being played, it becomes very obvious when they see it.
[01:15:42.201 --> 01:15:57.107]  You know, the reason, and I've been saying this all along, one of the worst problems that the government faces is they've never really conceptually gotten a handle on the Internet and alternative media, and they're still trying to play the propaganda game by the rules that worked at the height of the Cold War in the 1950s and the 1960s.
[01:15:59.062 --> 01:16:07.610]  Back when media was all one way, where the government says, the TV and radio broadcast, and the public accepts, and there was no feedback.
[01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:16.138]  But in the age of the Internet, the whole dynamic of information flow has changed, and the government has never quite gotten a handle on that.
[01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:19.942]  And that's why these Cold War-era propaganda tricks they're trying to play now,
[01:16:20.422 --> 01:16:28.546]  Not only don't work, they call attention to themselves, and this is the reason you have these polls, where the New Yorkers, half of them believe 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:16:28.546 --> 01:16:37.911]  And that number's going to keep on going up, because, you know, the facts are obvious when you look at them objectively.
[01:16:37.911 --> 01:16:39.732]  I want to get into the war in detail.
[01:16:39.732 --> 01:16:46.836]  Back in the McCasey, I want to talk to you about that article you just reported on, another admission of them engaging in covert propaganda, and now overt propaganda.
[01:16:47.908 --> 01:16:49.349]  Yeah, I would tend to agree with that, yeah.
[01:17:03.615 --> 01:17:08.177]  They're cornered now, and cornered animals are always the most, most dangerous.
[01:17:08.177 --> 01:17:12.959]  And we've got a bunch of leaders who realize that they're looking at war crimes trials.
[01:17:12.959 --> 01:17:14.840]  They're trying to play every card they've got.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:18.162]  They're trying to go back into threat of terror.
[01:17:18.162 --> 01:17:20.443]  They're trying to pull the God Gambit, you know.
[01:17:21.193 --> 01:17:25.896]  God has told us to go do this, and if you oppose us, you're standing up against God.
[01:17:25.896 --> 01:17:27.317]  And it's just, they're playing every card.
[01:17:27.317 --> 01:17:28.577]  What about the white Al Qaeda?
[01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:37.022]  I mean, four months ago, the British Intel and then the Fox put out this vague thing about 1,500 white Al Qaeda's.
[01:17:37.022 --> 01:17:41.385]  They're everywhere, they're going to kill you, and then at the end said, this isn't a confirmed report.
[01:17:41.385 --> 01:17:43.326]  Just totally made up on its face, and now,
[01:17:44.148 --> 01:17:48.670]  That little demonic, he just radiates weakness.
[01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:50.631]  That's what I call a chicken neck, I'm sorry.
[01:17:50.631 --> 01:17:58.955]  But Hayden, the guy that heads up the CIA, did head up the NSA, and now he says white Al Qaeda is everywhere and is going to kill us.
[01:17:58.955 --> 01:18:00.136]  I mean, this is really getting stupid.
[01:18:01.016 --> 01:18:12.914]  Well, what they're attempting to do is to justify the surveillance on ordinary Americans because people are starting to stand up to all the surveillance and the spying and the wiretapping and the emails and saying, why are you watching us?
[01:18:12.914 --> 01:18:15.278]  We're not the enemy, but you're treating us like the enemy.
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:20.624]  The enemy is over there, and if you believe the propaganda, it's the Arab Muslims.
[01:18:20.624 --> 01:18:21.444]  But it's over there.
[01:18:21.444 --> 01:18:22.325]  Why are you looking at us?
[01:18:22.325 --> 01:18:29.350]  So now they're trying to create this idea, well, there are Al-Qaeda in America, and they look just like you, and that's why we've got to look at all of you.
[01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:35.735]  And it's just another way of attempting to sell this idea that we should submit to constant scanning, constant surveillance.
[01:18:35.735 --> 01:18:36.815]  But it's a comic book!
[01:18:36.815 --> 01:18:39.297]  I mean, this is like a bad comic book.
[01:18:39.297 --> 01:18:40.418]  It's so transparent.
[01:18:41.756 --> 01:18:43.018]  It really, really is.
[01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:47.344]  And of course we all know about Adam Perlman, the so-called American Al-Qaeda.
[01:18:47.344 --> 01:18:49.928]  Apparently we've got another one just surfaced in New York.
[01:18:49.928 --> 01:18:54.935]  He's been running this blog with all this hate America, you know, Muslims should kill America stuff.
[01:18:54.935 --> 01:18:57.098]  And it turns out his real name is Joseph Cohen.
[01:18:57.771 --> 01:18:59.432]  And it's another fraud.
[01:18:59.432 --> 01:19:00.512]  They can't even find it.
[01:19:00.512 --> 01:19:12.718]  You've got the Intel Center uploading it, and Top Wired Magazine, you know, top computer people look at it, and they're placing the Intel Center bug in the same video letter as the Al-Qaeda bug.
[01:19:12.718 --> 01:19:15.659]  I mean, Adam Gadon, grandson of the ADL head.
[01:19:15.659 --> 01:19:18.641]  How dumb do they think we are?
[01:19:18.641 --> 01:19:23.683]  Well, obviously they think we're a lot dumber than we really are, because they keep trying to play these tricks.
[01:19:24.096 --> 01:19:29.237]  We keep exposing it and they keep scratching their heads and saying, wait a minute, this wasn't supposed to get caught out.
[01:19:29.237 --> 01:19:33.399]  We're supposed to be these really smart people who are going to own the world.
[01:19:33.399 --> 01:19:38.060]  And they keep falling on their own, they trip over their own feet.
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:47.822]  Well, I mean, come on, the grandson of the ADL head and it's uploaded in the same video layer as the, I mean, come on, folks.
[01:19:47.822 --> 01:19:48.643]  You know what that means?
[01:19:48.643 --> 01:19:51.663]  It's the government putting these out.
[01:19:51.663 --> 01:19:52.964]  It is a big idea.
[01:19:54.136 --> 01:19:55.877]  A New World Order.
[01:19:55.877 --> 01:20:00.798]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:00.798 --> 01:20:03.619]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:03.619 --> 01:20:06.400]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.601]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:16.903]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:19.949 --> 01:20:25.373]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:25.373 --> 01:20:29.255]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:29.255 --> 01:20:31.817]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:31.817 --> 01:20:32.978]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:32.978 --> 01:20:33.778]  They're not after money.
[01:20:33.778 --> 01:20:35.039]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:36.040]  They're after power.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.181]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:20:37.181 --> 01:20:41.944]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:20:49.889 --> 01:20:50.749]  We're good.
[01:21:13.157 --> 01:21:19.379]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:21:19.379 --> 01:21:23.181]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:21:23.181 --> 01:21:27.983]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:29.043]  Do your part.
[01:21:29.043 --> 01:21:31.644]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[01:22:03.475 --> 01:22:14.140]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:17.941]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:22:17.941 --> 01:22:19.701]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:25.822]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:22:41.465 --> 01:22:43.425]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:22:44.105 --> 01:22:49.423]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:22:50.239 --> 01:22:55.322]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[01:22:55.322 --> 01:22:59.205]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[01:22:59.205 --> 01:23:08.891]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[01:23:08.891 --> 01:23:13.294]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[01:23:13.294 --> 01:23:16.936]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins, and trace minerals.
[01:23:17.116 --> 01:23:27.424]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness, but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable, life-threatening diseases.
[01:23:27.424 --> 01:23:32.528]  Juicing with the Champion Juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[01:23:32.528 --> 01:23:35.230]  Put the Champion Juicer to work for you and your family.
[01:23:35.370 --> 01:23:36.251]  By the way, Mike Rivero,
[01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:03.599]  He's a special effects expert.
[01:24:03.599 --> 01:24:07.283]  He's worked on some of the biggest movie productions, major TV shows.
[01:24:07.283 --> 01:24:09.845]  He doesn't like to brag about it, but he does the Lost TV show.
[01:24:09.845 --> 01:24:11.227]  He's the main special effects guy there.
[01:24:11.227 --> 01:24:22.558]  And so he understands this, but a top computer video expert and several others have been looking at the Intel Center videos.
[01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:24.240]  And you'll have the Al-Qaeda graphic.
[01:24:26.607 --> 01:24:37.172]  And then you'll have, in the same video layer, and they have ways looking at the pixels to be able to tell this, in the same video layer, you will have the Intel Center logo.
[01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:43.876]  And there have been a lot of other reports where they always catch these different Elkata types being uploaded from government servers in the U.S.
[01:24:43.876 --> 01:24:47.938]  or uploaded from neocon companies.
[01:24:47.938 --> 01:24:50.319]  And then you have all of these, uh,
[01:24:51.272 --> 01:24:51.573]  U.S.
[01:24:51.573 --> 01:24:56.297]  citizens or Israeli citizens are tied into the ADL, caught putting out videos in English.
[01:24:56.297 --> 01:25:00.521]  Listen, scum, we will kill you dirty Americans!
[01:25:00.521 --> 01:25:05.946]  So you can hear it in your own language and people, that dirty Al-Qaeda!
[01:25:05.946 --> 01:25:10.911]  Mike, can you speak as a special effects expert on what we're witnessing here?
[01:25:10.911 --> 01:25:14.094]  Well, I don't think you need to look at it from the point of view of special effects.
[01:25:14.094 --> 01:25:16.336]  It's just very obviously it's propaganda.
[01:25:17.077 --> 01:25:25.243]  You know, political organizations, which, you know, everybody's a political organization, they build power by building supporters.
[01:25:25.243 --> 01:25:34.790]  They don't go out of their way to make enemies, especially enemies of people who are going to have the potential capability of coming in and inflicting serious, serious harm.
[01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:45.838]  So anytime you get anything that looks like it's an assault, you know, somebody's trying to pick a fight, and psychiatrists call this
[01:25:46.371 --> 01:25:57.200]  Let's you and him fight, and this is a human trait of exerting one's own power by tricking other people to hurt each other and kill each other for you, and keep your own hands clean.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.121]  The British call that the Great Game.
[01:25:59.121 --> 01:26:10.691]  Yeah, very much so, and you know, of course, Israel has a long record of playing these kind of deceptions, going back to the bombing of the King David Hotel, the Levon Affair, the attack on the USS Liberty,
[01:26:11.167 --> 01:26:21.093]  And so when you see these propaganda videos coming out that are being made by somebody that's known to be the grandson of an ADL board member, you have to say, what is this guy really trying to do?
[01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:33.539]  And it's obvious he's trying to build anger in America to go kill Muslims, and ultimately, because we have never actually been invaded by Muslims, this is something we have to ask.
[01:26:33.539 --> 01:26:37.261]  Who really stands to benefit by America's war on all these...
[01:26:39.915 --> 01:26:45.939]  Adam Perlman, now Gaddan, even got in trouble once and got arrested for going to Mosque to beat up Muslims.
[01:26:45.939 --> 01:26:50.522]  But he suddenly just loves them all and with al Qaeda!
[01:26:50.522 --> 01:26:52.023]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:52.023 --> 01:26:53.163]  It's a fake.
[01:26:53.163 --> 01:26:59.988]  They can't find real Muslim terrorists that are going to say the things that they need the American people to think Muslims are saying.
[01:26:59.988 --> 01:27:05.691]  Yeah, you dirty Americans will die soon!
[01:27:05.691 --> 01:27:06.552]  You do that very well.
[01:27:08.115 --> 01:27:09.075]  You know what?
[01:27:09.075 --> 01:27:12.357]  I mean, I could put a beard on and do that, too.
[01:27:12.357 --> 01:27:13.617]  Yeah, anybody can.
[01:27:13.617 --> 01:27:19.359]  And in some of the videos that we've seen, the beards are obviously phony.
[01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:21.560]  The guys don't even look like Osama over time.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.361]  The more they make these videotapes, the less like the real Osama looks.
[01:27:25.361 --> 01:27:33.264]  I think they're trying to migrate him into a newer, younger, more dangerous-looking version and hope that nobody notices that he's changing over time.
[01:27:34.132 --> 01:27:41.515]  But the reality is most people are now aware that Osama Bin Laden himself died in December of 2001 of medical issues.
[01:27:41.515 --> 01:27:46.557]  And every Osama since then has been a fake of one form or another.
[01:27:46.557 --> 01:27:50.199]  And like I said in the last segment, the problem from the point of view of the U.S.
[01:27:50.199 --> 01:27:54.761]  government is they're playing the game by the rules that worked in the 1950s and 1960s, and they just don't get it.
[01:27:58.457 --> 01:28:11.228]  You know, back in the 50s and 60s, they would be happy if they fooled 95% of Americans into going along with the agenda, because that other 5% that weren't fooled were harmless and helpless and couldn't do anything about it, but that has changed.
[01:28:11.228 --> 01:28:20.056]  The instant one person spots the fraud and puts out exactly why they think it's a fraud, everybody who reads it looks at it and says, oh yeah,
[01:28:20.632 --> 01:28:30.276]  And the instant the government is exposed on a single lie, all of a sudden everybody is looking at everything the government has ever said with a new, very critical eye.
[01:28:30.276 --> 01:28:32.938]  And they've been exposed in thousands of lies.
[01:28:32.938 --> 01:28:34.858]  There's another transparent lie.
[01:28:34.858 --> 01:28:43.122]  Every week there's a new Al-Qaeda tape that always serves the interests of the Western bankers, and that never even says where it comes from.
[01:28:43.122 --> 01:28:44.943]  It just says the message board has a new tape.
[01:28:46.098 --> 01:28:53.703]  And then the news acts like it's authentic, and suddenly all the standards of journalism for the AP and Reuters don't exist anymore.
[01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:55.364]  Well, the reason for that is very simple.
[01:28:55.364 --> 01:29:06.872]  Every time they would put out this new Al-Qaeda website, computer experts would track down the site and they'd find it was located in West Virginia, or in Texas, or some other place inside the United States.
[01:29:06.872 --> 01:29:11.775]  They couldn't hide where the actual server was, so now they won't announce them anymore.
[01:29:11.775 --> 01:29:12.656]  They won't name them.
[01:29:13.226 --> 01:29:20.111]  And ostensibly this is to keep impressionable minds from going to the Al-Qaeda websites and becoming terrorists themselves.
[01:29:20.111 --> 01:29:25.535]  But the reality is, they can't put out a convincing web server... Well, it's real simple.
[01:29:25.535 --> 01:29:33.581]  They blow up the video of Adam Gadda on the ADL guy, and it's in the same pixels.
[01:29:33.581 --> 01:29:36.543]  You see, if you lay it over the video, it's in a different pixel.
[01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:39.411]  And it's just absolutely fake, folks.
[01:29:39.411 --> 01:29:40.432]  They're uploading it.
[01:29:40.432 --> 01:29:41.712]  They should all be arrested.
[01:29:41.712 --> 01:29:43.113]  We're on the march.
[01:29:43.113 --> 01:29:45.634]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.634 --> 01:29:51.737]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:26.982 --> 01:30:33.023]  The Road Warrior Radio unveils the truth and exposes the lies and disinfo that pervade society.
[01:30:33.343 --> 01:30:38.309]  Have you noticed all areas of American civics have slanted in to usher in the One World Nation State?

[01:31:52.523 --> 01:31:58.607]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:31:58.607 --> 01:32:04.551]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:32:04.551 --> 01:32:08.714]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:32:08.714 --> 01:32:13.617]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:32:13.857 --> 01:32:22.360]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:31.714]  I have people whining and complaining in the message boards that we don't censor people enough.
[01:33:31.714 --> 01:33:35.616]  And we've got folks in there trying to set us up too, calling for violence and stuff, and we track it back.
[01:33:35.616 --> 01:33:36.117]  It's the cops.
[01:33:37.133 --> 01:33:38.994]  And other people saying, you know, why don't you censor?
[01:33:38.994 --> 01:33:39.454]  You need to.
[01:33:39.454 --> 01:33:43.336]  Well, that's why you have free speech, too.
[01:33:43.336 --> 01:33:51.181]  It's because we're not censoring what's going on in the message boards and places and where you can comment on the articles at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:51.181 --> 01:33:54.903]  Though, when people call for violence, we do make an attempt to go and delete it.
[01:33:54.903 --> 01:34:02.707]  We always track the IP back and it appears to be the federal porcines that are doing it.
[01:34:03.496 --> 01:34:10.980]  We're going to go back to Mike Rivero here in just a moment to talk about the war, to talk about Iran, to talk about Mukasey, to talk about the economy.
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:13.061]  We'll take a few calls for Mike, too, at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:13.061 --> 01:34:13.161]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:13.161 --> 01:34:15.403]  We'll start taking your calls here in about 10 minutes or so.
[01:34:15.403 --> 01:34:17.944]  Before I go any further, though, I want to tell you about Interfood.
[01:34:29.978 --> 01:34:33.941]  Even when I had Dr. Dina Dell on a few weeks ago, he was like, vitamins don't help you.
[01:34:33.941 --> 01:34:38.364]  And I said, oh, but aren't most Americans deficient in nutrients?
[01:34:38.364 --> 01:34:42.447]  And he said, well, yes, you do need vitamins if you're deficient, and a lot of us are.
[01:34:42.447 --> 01:34:43.848]  See, that's how they spin it.
[01:34:43.848 --> 01:34:49.372]  Oh, yeah, if you've got all the nutrients you need, you're eating enough raw foods and things, then sure, you don't need vitamins.
[01:34:49.372 --> 01:34:50.092]  See, they spin it.
[01:34:50.092 --> 01:34:52.554]  They say, oh, yeah, you do need it if you're deficient.
[01:34:52.554 --> 01:34:53.935]  Well, most Americans are deficient.
[01:34:53.935 --> 01:34:58.378]  This is unpasteurized, 20 superfoods all put together.
[01:34:59.355 --> 01:35:04.679]  Like Dulse Kelp, Barley Grass, Wheatgrass, Colorella, Spirulina, and I take it every day.
[01:35:04.679 --> 01:35:05.580]  My office is taking it.
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:17.809]  It's just two little scoops in orange juice or apple juice or whatever, and it's just filled with the trace elements and minerals and things, and it won't make you live forever, but it will make you healthy and happy.
[01:35:17.809 --> 01:35:20.632]  So it's not a snake oil like some of the
[01:35:21.673 --> 01:35:22.814]  You know, cure-alls out there.
[01:35:22.814 --> 01:35:26.996]  It's just high-quality green food.

[01:35:51.451 --> 01:36:03.674]  Is new vitality and they have hundreds of different products but the two that I looked at that I know are good is the aloe ease body cleanse.
[01:36:03.674 --> 01:36:07.294]  Aloe vera is a very powerful plant.
[01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:11.075]  The Indians would take it to flush out their guts.
[01:36:11.075 --> 01:36:14.896]  It is just an amazing plant and it's got a bunch of other well-known herbs
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:18.300]  That are really good for your GI tract.
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:19.721]  And that's 1-800-569-4056.

[01:36:40.864 --> 01:36:43.705]  In the next few weeks, we're going to be adding even more
[01:36:44.694 --> 01:36:46.617]  Uh, functions and facets to it.
[01:36:46.617 --> 01:36:55.186]  Uh, like I'll take one hour out of the show each day and have a vid cam in here with a document cam to show you articles as I cover them and to play video clips.
[01:36:55.186 --> 01:36:56.628]  That'll be four members.
[01:36:56.628 --> 01:37:02.534]  It's gonna be in 56 or maybe even 64k audio, uh, when we do that one hour a day.
[01:37:03.295 --> 01:37:06.039]  Uh, so that's coming up in the next few weeks.
[01:37:06.039 --> 01:37:14.508]  And, uh, 15 cents a day, PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films in super-high quality, my weekly TV reports, and so much more, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:14.508 --> 01:37:22.558]  And while you're at it, don't forget to support other truth-seekers and activists like Mike Rivera by checking out his website and his sponsors at WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:37:23.138 --> 01:37:27.720]  He also has a radio show here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:31.342]  You can find that at GCNLive.com in the schedule area.
[01:37:31.342 --> 01:37:35.244]  Going back to Mike, I want to move quick, Mike, here.
[01:37:35.244 --> 01:37:49.711]  Your take on the plan to go into Iran, despite the fact that it's unpopular, despite the fact that the people don't want it, they are still, we had Betrayus say last week that he wanted
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:56.306]  To, you know, do something against Iran because he thought they launched the attacks on the Green Zone.
[01:37:56.306 --> 01:37:58.810]  Then you have Bush bragging that they ordered the attack.
[01:37:58.810 --> 01:38:02.755]  Then when it failed in Basra, he said he wasn't part of the attack.
[01:38:02.755 --> 01:38:04.898]  We've got amassing troops.
[01:38:04.898 --> 01:38:08.202]  Do you really think they've got the chutzpah or the bravado to do it?
[01:38:09.432 --> 01:38:13.258]  Well, I don't even think it has anything to do with HUSPA and bravado.
[01:38:13.258 --> 01:38:24.115]  I think the plan is that if they can start a whole new war in Iran, that they might get back their popularity and their poll numbers that they got after the invasion of Iraq immediately after.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:30.763]  In other words, they're trying to create a whole new crisis to distract from all the other crises that are definitely turning against them.
[01:38:30.763 --> 01:38:41.108]  But I'm looking at this last situation in Basra, and before it kicked up, first part of the month of March, they were saying that everything was really quiet in Iraq, and that proved the surge was working.
[01:38:41.108 --> 01:38:49.052]  And then as soon as we have all this violence escalating, Bush is back on TV saying, this proves the surge is working, because now they're striking back against it.
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:53.021]  And it was like, no matter what happens, you know, it's a good thing for us.
[01:38:53.021 --> 01:38:55.702]  It proves the surge is working, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:38:55.702 --> 01:39:08.085]  And it really, they're lying to look good at the moment, and they're really not even paying attention to what they said before, because they're assuming that the rest of us aren't paying attention to what was said before.
[01:39:08.085 --> 01:39:16.387]  And again, this reveals they don't understand how the information processing of the American people and the rest of the world is changing.
[01:39:16.798 --> 01:39:18.200]  In the current age.
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:21.643]  They're totally reactive here.
[01:39:21.643 --> 01:39:23.025]  They're in crisis management.
[01:39:23.025 --> 01:39:28.531]  And I think the desire to go into Iran is, first of all, to prove that they can still do it.
[01:39:28.531 --> 01:39:31.354]  To prove that they and not the American people are running the country.
[01:39:31.354 --> 01:39:32.315]  But mostly, I think,
[01:39:32.884 --> 01:39:45.787]  They are convinced that if they can start a new war in Iran, that all of a sudden the American people are going to fall into line behind them and say, yes, we've got a big war, we must march off and send our children to die in Iran, and so forth and so on.
[01:39:45.787 --> 01:39:55.409]  Ultimately, though, if Bush keeps pushing, we could find ourselves at war with Russia or China, or both, and I don't think that's the situation any of us want.
[01:39:57.256 --> 01:39:59.558]  Well, I agree with you that they see it as failing forward.
[01:39:59.558 --> 01:40:11.046]  Like all the Republican memos have said, either we're going to have a new war, or Saddam is going to be captured, but that didn't work, or Bin Laden is going to be captured, or a new 9-11.
[01:40:11.046 --> 01:40:17.010]  And then we had Republicans writing all these memos, and then it came out in the news, oh, we want terror attacks.
[01:40:18.952 --> 01:40:23.555]  I mean, first off, they do need to fail forward, but I see that as blowing up in their face.
[01:40:23.555 --> 01:40:34.023]  Do you think they realize that, A, and then B, why do we have people like Gary Hart coming out and writing letters to Iran saying, we'll stage terror attacks, you better do what we say?
[01:40:34.023 --> 01:40:40.448]  It just seems like it's a mix of panic plus total hubris.
[01:40:40.448 --> 01:40:43.791]  Yeah, absolutely, and that's a bad combination because sooner or later,
[01:40:44.455 --> 01:40:57.811]  When you have a political leadership that is that in love with their own agenda and philosophy and their self-image, and that out of touch with their own people, sooner or later they're going to make the big mistake that brings it all down.
[01:40:57.811 --> 01:41:01.335]  I mean, if you go back and you look at Ceausescu or Charles I or Louis XVI,
[01:41:03.838 --> 01:41:10.403]  These were rulers who miscalculated and they made the mistake of pushing just a little too far and it all came apart.
[01:41:10.403 --> 01:41:23.934]  Well they miscalculated, they miscalculated, they tried to have a nine to the long knives against the Shiites, tried to arrest and kill them from Baghdad to Basra, and then the Shiites fought back and the news didn't even report that.
[01:41:23.934 --> 01:41:28.438]  It was all over the foreign press and just said those dirty Shiites, they snuck attack us.
[01:41:28.438 --> 01:41:31.000]  No, the globalists ran a sneak attack on them.
[01:41:31.846 --> 01:41:39.256]  Yeah, Maliki started the whole situation, and he found himself with his hand in a bear trap and tried to pull back.
[01:41:39.256 --> 01:41:42.641]  And Iran comes in playing peacemaker, which makes the U.S.
[01:41:42.641 --> 01:41:43.762]  look even worse.
[01:41:43.762 --> 01:41:48.569]  And al-Sadr says, yeah, we'll back off as long as you don't attack us again.
[01:41:49.238 --> 01:41:55.063]  And what that basically means is Maliki is now seen as no longer in control of all of Iraq.
[01:41:55.063 --> 01:42:06.372]  And it turns out that Bush's boyfriend, Petraeus, known as Petraeus, it turns out that he really thought that al-Sadr stood down because he was weak.
[01:42:06.372 --> 01:42:08.794]  Instead, al-Sadr had built up their system.
[01:42:11.093 --> 01:42:25.103]  Absolutely, and the consensus coming out of Iraq right now is there are parts of Iraq that are under Maliki's control, there are parts of Iraq which de facto are under al-Sadr's control, and everybody knows which is which, and they know not to go into the other side.
[01:42:25.103 --> 01:42:34.049]  And this is probably going to deteriorate into the same situation we had in Mogadishu a few years back, if you go back to the whole Blackhawk Down situation.
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:39.561]  Where everything's factionalized and broke up and we wound up, you know, the U.S.
[01:42:39.561 --> 01:42:42.041]  wound up very embarrassed in that situation.
[01:42:42.041 --> 01:42:43.322]  Iraq is deteriorating.
[01:42:43.322 --> 01:42:45.202]  There's no two ways about it.
[01:42:45.202 --> 01:42:53.543]  This whole surge idea was working in the first place only because we were bribing the people on the other side not to shoot at us.
[01:42:53.543 --> 01:42:55.724]  And obviously it's a huge amount of damage.
[01:42:55.724 --> 01:42:58.564]  And it was working and the deaths have been cut in about half.
[01:42:58.564 --> 01:43:01.045]  Still a complete disaster five plus years in.
[01:43:01.045 --> 01:43:03.065]  And then they had to break their own deal.
[01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:08.172]  I mean, that's a consistent problem with the United States.
[01:43:08.172 --> 01:43:14.196]  They'll make a deal with one group and then they'll say, oh, that's no longer operative, and they go make a different deal.
[01:43:14.196 --> 01:43:18.859]  And that's one of the reasons why no foreign government on earth will really trust the United States anymore.
[01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:19.300]  Well, that's it.
[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:25.764]  There's nothing worse than an individual or a company or a government that knowingly lies and cheats you.
[01:43:25.764 --> 01:43:27.585]  People just stop dealing with you.
[01:43:28.945 --> 01:43:38.094]  Well, you know, Bush has violated and just outright ignored so many treaties, and that's considered the highest commitment between nations, is when you sign a treaty.
[01:43:38.094 --> 01:43:52.347]  And for Bush to have set so many of them aside, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, the Geneva Conventions, all of these things are no longer part of the United States, and the rest of the world is saying, okay, well, the U.S.
[01:43:52.347 --> 01:43:53.969]  is not the moral leader they used to be.
[01:43:54.821 --> 01:44:01.544]  You know, we're going to be decades recovering from this, if we recover from it at all.
[01:44:01.544 --> 01:44:07.806]  Also, Cheney and Bush and Rumsfeld came out and bragged about torture in press conferences.
[01:44:07.806 --> 01:44:13.708]  I'll never forget seeing Rumsfeld openly say it in a Pentagon press conference in 2002.
[01:44:13.708 --> 01:44:21.111]  They thought they could sell everybody on their mindset because they have to recruit people, so they have to kind of be public about what they want to do.
[01:44:21.937 --> 01:44:44.476]  And they've hung their shingle out, and they've said, hey, we want martial law, we want police state, we want 100-year war, we want to take your rights, and the people are rejecting it, and in a way, they're trying to sell evil as good, I think, prove to everybody that you and I and others were telling them the truth, because this stuff sounded crazy 10 years ago, or 5 years ago.
[01:44:44.476 --> 01:44:45.958]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:44:45.958 --> 01:44:48.540]  When I started, what really happened, you know, 15 years ago now,
[01:44:49.091 --> 01:44:51.313]  I mean, I was ostracized and criticized.
[01:44:51.313 --> 01:44:57.397]  I was literally kicked out of Hollywood for saying the things I was saying.
[01:44:57.397 --> 01:45:01.981]  Now, all of a sudden, people are coming back to me and saying, you know, you were right all along.
[01:45:01.981 --> 01:45:03.502]  They really were planning this stuff.
[01:45:05.522 --> 01:45:23.109]  You know, and it really doesn't make me feel all that much better for them to be saying, now, you were right, because if they'd realized I was, or we were right back then, we might have had a little more success in kind of heading off some of the stuff that's happened, that we didn't want to happen, like the torture.
[01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:32.373]  But, you know, at least people are waking up now, and I think because of that, you know, there is a good chance we may be able to derail this rush into World War III.
[01:45:32.373 --> 01:45:33.533]  I hope so.
[01:45:33.533 --> 01:45:34.354]  I just know this.
[01:45:36.789 --> 01:45:40.512]  You know, for people out there listening, don't think we're completely out of the woods.
[01:45:40.512 --> 01:45:42.733]  The people running our country are very bold.
[01:45:42.733 --> 01:45:44.314]  I mean, they flew planes into buildings.
[01:45:44.314 --> 01:45:48.637]  They killed 3,000 of us because it's a military decision.
[01:45:48.637 --> 01:45:55.883]  Just like a military leader will put 3,000 of his troops in a valley to pull in the enemy to show themselves and knowing it will sacrifice his 3,000.
[01:45:55.883 --> 01:45:59.985]  That's happened many, many times with even greater numbers in some cases.
[01:45:59.985 --> 01:46:06.150]  So it was a military mindset that did that out of the military-industrial complex allied with
[01:46:07.057 --> 01:46:18.708]  uh... the international bankers we don't understand they are very bold mike they are bold and uh... i'd just i'd just hope and pray that somehow people in government stop them
[01:46:20.248 --> 01:46:27.154]  Well, I'd like to see that, but, you know, I kind of had that same idea 15 years ago when all I was focused on was the Vince Foster case.
[01:46:27.154 --> 01:46:35.702]  I kept thinking, if I just put out these facts, you know, that people within the FBI are going to say, hey, yeah, there's really a crime that took place here.
[01:46:35.702 --> 01:46:38.285]  It didn't happen, unfortunately.
[01:46:38.285 --> 01:46:41.147]  Our government really is corrupted all the way through.
[01:46:41.147 --> 01:46:46.072]  But in addition to the idea of being bold, a lot of our leaders are just outright sociopathic.
[01:46:46.485 --> 01:46:52.150]  They literally cannot feel what their actions caused pain to other people.
[01:46:52.150 --> 01:46:53.431]  They can't feel that.
[01:46:53.431 --> 01:47:00.038]  The other part of it is, there is, within some circles of government, an agenda for depopulation.
[01:47:00.038 --> 01:47:11.468]  If you look what's happening right now with the food shortages starting to happen, everybody's going to be screaming, population is a problem, and this all goes back to Henry Kissinger's National Security Study 200,
[01:47:12.819 --> 01:47:20.393]  Which during the Nixon era said, we can control world population if we can deliberately cause famine around the world.
[01:47:20.393 --> 01:47:21.275]  Food is a weapon.
[01:47:21.275 --> 01:47:21.756]  Food is a weapon.
[01:47:21.756 --> 01:47:24.561]  You have the 96th UN Food Summit saying the same thing.
[01:47:25.545 --> 01:47:26.506]  And that's the big issue.
[01:47:26.506 --> 01:47:32.951]  There is a larger international force playing Bush and the neocons kind of as their meat puppets.
[01:47:32.951 --> 01:47:41.977]  But now I do see even that elite group seeing that the rook they put forward, the neocons, has been a failure.
[01:47:41.977 --> 01:47:52.024]  And now they're trying to extricate themselves from what they've started, and it appears that the neocons are running along on their own steam, refusing to be drawn back in.
[01:47:52.024 --> 01:47:53.065]  Do you agree with that analysis?
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:58.382]  Yeah, I would, but you know, it's not always that clear cut.
[01:47:58.382 --> 01:48:02.385]  There are a lot of overlapping factions and a lot of temporary alliances.
[01:48:02.385 --> 01:48:07.809]  I think a lot of the support the Neocons did have is leaving them because they've become too visible.
[01:48:07.809 --> 01:48:19.118]  They've really lost the support of the majority of the American people who recognize there's nothing really conservative about the Neoconservative movement, that it's basically fascism under a new name.
[01:48:19.688 --> 01:48:29.636]  And Americans have really turned their backs on that, especially because we've been bankrupted by these wars, started with lies, and... But I'm talking about the elites.
[01:48:29.636 --> 01:48:33.059]  I'm talking about the Vildenberg Group, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:38.271]  I think that's the same group of people.
[01:48:38.271 --> 01:48:46.576]  I think their support for the neocons is definitely on the wane because the neocons have not been able to deliver what they were going to deliver, which is U.S.
[01:48:46.576 --> 01:48:49.078]  war on eight nations in the Mideast.
[01:48:49.078 --> 01:48:50.659]  We're bogged down in the first two.
[01:48:50.659 --> 01:48:52.520]  It's a fight to start the third.
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:58.503]  No way is this going to sustain to reach all of the eventual targets that was in the neocons.
[01:48:58.503 --> 01:48:58.823]  That's right.
[01:48:58.823 --> 01:49:03.486]  It's not as easy as the armchair generals said it would be.
[01:49:03.486 --> 01:49:04.727]  That's absolutely it.
[01:49:04.727 --> 01:49:06.328]  So now they're looking for another device.
[01:49:06.690 --> 01:49:20.461]  That's one of the reasons why I think, believe it or not, the same forces are kind of behind this whole global warming thing where they want to sell us carbon taxes, they want to justify complete control over our lives in terms of how much energy we're using.
[01:49:20.461 --> 01:49:21.521]  No, they've got two tracks.
[01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:30.008]  They've got, we're going to take your rights to fight the boogeyman al-Qaeda, and we're going to take your rights to fight the boogeyman Mr. Evil Carbon Dioxide.
[01:49:30.008 --> 01:49:31.489]  Yeah, that's basically it.
[01:49:31.489 --> 01:49:36.393]  It's constantly creating a new enemy for you to be afraid of so that they can take your money and your rights away
[01:49:36.818 --> 01:49:52.608]  In order to protect you from, uh, you know, the mythical Osama Carbon... Meanwhile, Mike, they're genetic engineering uncontrolled, deadly dangerous, they've got particle accelerators smashing heavy elements together, and the majority of physicists say it's very dangerous.
[01:49:52.608 --> 01:49:55.110]  What's wrong with this elite?
[01:49:55.110 --> 01:50:05.577]  Well, the elite, they're in love with their own power and ability to do things, and, you know, they basically look back through history, and they say everything that bad goes on, we can stick on somebody else.
[01:50:05.970 --> 01:50:18.060]  But in the case of the genetic engineering, and possibly with this accelerator in Europe, we're dealing with technologies that have the potential really to wreck the entire world and not just an area.
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:22.004]  Chernobyl, as terrible as it was, was confined to a small area.
[01:50:22.004 --> 01:50:24.646]  You put up a chain link fence around it, nobody goes in.
[01:50:25.844 --> 01:50:26.725]  Disaster's over.
[01:50:26.725 --> 01:50:31.149]  We've had industrial accidents with dioxin, where they have to basically... Stay there!
[01:50:31.149 --> 01:50:32.671]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:50:32.671 --> 01:50:35.493]  Mike Rivera, and I promise we're going to get to Dan, Drew, and others.
[01:50:35.493 --> 01:50:37.775]  Keep Mike a few minutes into the next hour, if you can do that.

[01:50:51.533 --> 01:50:53.534]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:50:53.534 --> 01:50:57.155]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:50:57.155 --> 01:50:59.616]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:50:59.616 --> 01:51:02.678]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:51:02.678 --> 01:51:08.460]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:12.402]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:51:53.735 --> 01:51:57.998]  Would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[01:51:57.998 --> 01:52:06.845]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch.
[01:52:07.185 --> 01:52:07.585]  We're good to go.
[01:52:26.590 --> 01:52:26.990]  I think so.
[01:52:52.875 --> 01:52:53.595]  Alright, Dad.
[01:52:53.595 --> 01:52:54.895]  Let me get this straight.
[01:52:54.895 --> 01:52:57.056]  Uncivil Liberties takes place in the future, right?
[01:52:57.056 --> 01:52:58.076]  Like Star Wars?
[01:52:58.076 --> 01:52:58.916]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:52:58.916 --> 01:53:00.097]  Slightly in the future.
[01:53:00.097 --> 01:53:01.177]  Wait a second.
[01:53:01.177 --> 01:53:04.438]  I thought Star Wars took place a long, long time ago.
[01:53:04.438 --> 01:53:05.498]  Alright, Einstein.
[01:53:05.498 --> 01:53:07.678]  But it is kind of like Star Wars anyway.
[01:53:07.678 --> 01:53:14.300]  Just like Star Wars, there's an evil empire and some people have started an armed rebellion to fight the evil empire.
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:17.861]  Okay, so don't tell me, the government's the bad guys again?
[01:53:17.861 --> 01:53:19.002]  Yep, that's right.
[01:53:19.002 --> 01:53:21.702]  Oh, so your character's like Luke Skywalker?
[01:53:21.702 --> 01:53:22.763]  Not exactly.
[01:53:22.763 --> 01:53:24.864]  I know, you're Chewbacca!
[01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:33.947]  Not really, but my character does help the rebellion to stop the government's evil tracking system, which is happening now in the real world, just like in Uncivil Liberties.
[01:53:33.947 --> 01:53:37.108]  Wait a second, they can't track us, it's a free country!
[01:53:37.108 --> 01:53:37.648]  Exactly.
[01:53:38.664 --> 01:53:42.470]  Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.

[01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:13.651]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board?
[01:54:13.651 --> 01:54:20.353]  And let this train keep on ridin', ridin' on through!
[01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:21.133]  Well, well!
[01:54:21.133 --> 01:54:27.554]  People of the world, don't need no money, come on!
[01:54:27.554 --> 01:54:31.235]  Start a love train, don't need no tickets, come on!
[01:54:44.721 --> 01:54:51.803]  All right, back to Mike Rivero and then to Dan, Drew, David, James, and John.
[01:54:51.803 --> 01:54:53.944]  Mike, just briefly, then we'll go right to the calls.
[01:54:53.944 --> 01:54:55.604]  Super Science.
[01:54:55.604 --> 01:54:56.164]  It's here.
[01:54:56.164 --> 01:54:57.965]  It's 2008.
[01:54:57.965 --> 01:55:01.666]  Max Planck and others, a hundred years ago, drew up equations for A-bombs.
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:06.402]  Sixty-five years ago they detonated one.
[01:55:06.402 --> 01:55:10.204]  And now we've got things much more advanced and the scientists have been reading over it.
[01:55:10.204 --> 01:55:18.008]  Prestigious physicists are saying there is a good chance that doing this could really cause massive disasters.
[01:55:18.008 --> 01:55:18.848]  And they don't care.
[01:55:18.848 --> 01:55:23.551]  They just say they're going to do it and they're not going to stop.
[01:55:23.551 --> 01:55:27.573]  The psychology of that is bizarre.
[01:55:27.573 --> 01:55:31.595]  Yeah, it really, really is because we're getting to an area where
[01:55:32.328 --> 01:55:37.532]  The technologies do have a potential to threaten Earth as a whole.
[01:55:37.532 --> 01:55:42.896]  And the example I like to use is not from the nuclear physics, but from genetic research.
[01:55:42.896 --> 01:55:48.860]  Because when you have an accident like a Chernobyl, as terrible as it is, it's confined to just one place.
[01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:56.806]  You put fences around it, you say nobody can go in there for the next thousand years, and that's kind of the end of it, and you live and learn and you move forward.
[01:55:56.806 --> 01:55:59.328]  But in the case of genetic tinkering,
[01:55:59.924 --> 01:56:14.156]  Where a lot of these products are being put out before they're fully understood how they're going to affect the environment, and we start getting these synthetic genes migrating into natural plants, and we get unpredictable effects.
[01:56:14.156 --> 01:56:24.164]  There is, apparently back in 1999, it was already known that genetically modified plants were killing the larvae of monarch butterflies.
[01:56:24.631 --> 01:56:31.997]  And now, of course, we have the situation where the bees that we depend on to pollinate our food crop plants are starting to die off.
[01:56:31.997 --> 01:56:38.562]  Apparently, statistics out of North Dakota is they've lost half their bee population in the last year.
[01:56:38.562 --> 01:56:46.629]  So, unlike a nuclear accident, which is confined to one area, if you get a bad gene, like a gene that sterilizes life forms,
[01:56:47.074 --> 01:56:52.376]  After so many generations, and it gets out into the wild, it will spread everywhere on Earth.
[01:56:52.376 --> 01:57:04.861]  Or nanotech, biological nanotech, the classic grey goo, or something that, you know, attacks the basic oxygen absorption of all blood cells, killing all animals.
[01:57:04.861 --> 01:57:15.405]  I mean, it's just like five years ago, the big government university in Australia released the coding and the recipe to build a mousepox that kills any mammal you engineer it for 100%.
[01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:19.372]  And they just put out the ingredient list.
[01:57:19.372 --> 01:57:21.754]  Why do you think they're doing that, Mike?
[01:57:21.754 --> 01:57:33.002]  Well, it was a very reckless thing to do, and I know sometimes that university scientists, you know, don't see the world as necessarily an evil place, and they need to be careful.
[01:57:33.002 --> 01:57:38.427]  But yeah, they put these formulas out there, and now we've got our scientists up in there in the Arctic.
[01:57:38.427 --> 01:57:44.832]  They're digging up the Spanish flu to play with again, which, by the way, is hideously misnamed because it did not come from Spain.
[01:57:44.832 --> 01:57:45.612]  It came from U.S.
[01:57:45.612 --> 01:57:46.393]  military bases.
[01:57:47.077 --> 01:57:56.945]  But with regard to the situation with the Collider in CERN, I'm surprised to hear them say that it could conceivably make a quantum black hole.
[01:57:57.429 --> 01:58:10.673]  I'm even more alarmed where they're saying that they just assumed that any quantum black hole made would simply evaporate, because this is based on a very flawed, I feel, theory of the universe.
[01:58:10.673 --> 01:58:12.694]  I don't know if we have enough time to really get into it.
[01:58:12.694 --> 01:58:13.174]  You know what?
[01:58:13.174 --> 01:58:13.934]  Sure, sure.
[01:58:13.934 --> 01:58:14.955]  No, no, this is important.
[01:58:14.955 --> 01:58:18.316]  We've got a guest coming up in about 20 minutes, but I want to get to these calls.
[01:58:18.316 --> 01:58:20.957]  I promise we'll get to Dan Drew, David James, and John.
[01:58:20.957 --> 01:58:21.917]  Be ready.
[01:58:21.917 --> 01:58:24.398]  But I'm going to get Mike Rivero's take on this.
[01:58:25.078 --> 01:58:33.165]  Yeah, Hawking just says he hopes everything will be okay.
[01:58:33.165 --> 01:58:35.787]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:35.787 --> 01:58:39.050]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:39.050 --> 01:58:43.293]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:43.293 --> 01:58:46.115]  A new world order.
[01:58:46.115 --> 01:58:50.479]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:51.004 --> 01:58:53.825]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:53.825 --> 01:58:56.606]  Put their objective being world domination.
[01:58:56.606 --> 01:58:59.787]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.787 --> 01:59:07.110]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:15.585]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.585 --> 01:59:18.888]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:18.888 --> 01:59:22.030]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:23.191]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.191 --> 01:59:23.972]  They're not after money.
[01:59:23.972 --> 01:59:25.253]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.253 --> 01:59:26.234]  They're after power.
[01:59:26.234 --> 01:59:27.395]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:59:36.101 --> 01:59:36.881]  Endgame.
[01:59:36.881 --> 01:59:38.882]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:59:38.882 --> 01:59:44.124]  You have been warned.
[01:59:44.124 --> 01:59:46.506]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.506 --> 01:59:49.287]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:55.854 --> 01:59:57.596]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:57.596 --> 01:59:59.197]  You want answers?
[01:59:59.197 --> 02:00:00.758]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:00.758 --> 02:00:04.942]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.942 --> 02:00:10.286]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.286 --> 02:00:13.028]  We're already into hour number three of your calls here momentarily.
[02:00:13.028 --> 02:00:21.996]  We've got a physicist coming on to talk about the dangers of this heavy reactor, this superconducting supercollider.
[02:00:23.041 --> 02:00:28.483]  Over in Europe, they've just completed and they're about to start playing with the building blocks of the universe.
[02:00:28.483 --> 02:00:33.084]  And a lot of prestigious physicists are warning it's very dangerous.
[02:00:33.084 --> 02:00:40.807]  They have already made black holes in some of these laboratories, but these are even bigger and more dangerous types that they admit can be made.
[02:00:40.807 --> 02:00:44.308]  Talking to Mike Rivera, finishing up with your take on that, Mike, and then we're going to go to calls.
[02:00:45.419 --> 02:00:49.481]  Well, basically, the idea that black holes are going to evaporate.
[02:00:49.481 --> 02:00:51.422]  I'm not sure what they're creating in the laboratory.
[02:00:51.422 --> 02:00:59.947]  And one of the things to keep in mind is, at the energy levels that they're talking about, that this device is operating, they may not be finding new subatomic particles.
[02:00:59.947 --> 02:01:02.108]  They may be creating them.
[02:01:02.108 --> 02:01:03.529]  And there's a disconnect.
[02:01:03.529 --> 02:01:04.690]  No, no, that's what they say.
[02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:06.511]  No, they say they want to make them.
[02:01:06.511 --> 02:01:09.052]  They admit this new mega-reactor does that.
[02:01:10.174 --> 02:01:18.019]  And the idea is these particles may not exist in nature, so what the value of creating them is, you know, we can't really care about.
[02:01:18.019 --> 02:01:18.639]  No, no, that's what I said.
[02:01:18.639 --> 02:01:20.020]  They've already made new ones.
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:26.203]  You know, 20, 30 years ago, going back over 40, they have those other systems where they have made new elements.
[02:01:26.203 --> 02:01:27.864]  But go ahead, Mike.
[02:01:27.864 --> 02:01:32.447]  Yeah, the idea is that, you know, this is a very dangerous device.
[02:01:32.447 --> 02:01:39.311]  When you start getting into the idea of creating black holes, I challenge this idea that somehow they just evaporate.
[02:01:40.047 --> 02:01:58.103]  Because the reason that it's claimed they simply evaporate is because if you subscribe to the theory of the Big Bang, in that moment where the universe came into being, the mass density was so great there should have been all huge clouds of little tiny black holes.
[02:01:58.103 --> 02:02:01.686]  You know, planet-sized ones, centimeter-sized ones, subatomic-sized ones.
[02:02:02.293 --> 02:02:09.558]  And eventually the whole universe would become, instead of one gigantic black hole at the beginning, a lot of smaller black holes all over the universe.
[02:02:09.558 --> 02:02:10.679]  We didn't see this happen.
[02:02:10.679 --> 02:02:15.562]  So the question is, where do all these black holes that had to attend the creation of the universe go to?
[02:02:15.562 --> 02:02:18.084]  They say, oh, well, they simply evaporated.
[02:02:18.084 --> 02:02:20.666]  But this is kind of like the theory of epicycles.
[02:02:20.666 --> 02:02:25.349]  When they began to look at the planets and realized they didn't follow the path that the Earth-centered
[02:02:25.885 --> 02:02:34.187]  A universe theory said they should, instead of going back and looking at that first theory, they made up the theory of epicycles, which ultimately turned out to be fake.
[02:02:34.187 --> 02:02:44.090]  If they create a real black hole in this collider, I'm not reassured it's going to simply evaporate, and of course there's no way to hang on to something like that.
[02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:50.372]  If they create a real black hole and they drop it, basically that's, you know, that's the death warrant on the Earth.
[02:02:50.372 --> 02:02:53.333]  No, it's going to go to the core of the Earth and suck the planet into it.
[02:02:53.968 --> 02:02:58.610]  Yeah, and it's really risky for them to be doing this.
[02:02:58.610 --> 02:03:03.892]  And I know they've made the claim that they've created tiny black holes that vanished instantaneously.
[02:03:03.892 --> 02:03:15.437]  I'm not sure they really did, because, you know, once you have a mass that is in a black hole state, by what means is that mass or energy ever able to escape it?
[02:03:15.437 --> 02:03:20.779]  So you can ask your physicist guest about that, and I would love to be enlightened, but I am not
[02:03:21.315 --> 02:03:28.319]  Absolutely reassured that a genuine black hole created in the laboratory is simply going to pop out of existence.
[02:03:28.319 --> 02:03:32.762]  Yeah, well they talk about them decaying if they don't get enough mass sucked into them.
[02:03:32.762 --> 02:03:40.486]  But you would imagine that the Big Bang there's going to be plenty of matter to be sucked into the black holes to make them larger and more powerful.
[02:03:40.486 --> 02:03:46.330]  Plus, if it got so dense it then exploded, why didn't it immediately start contracting again?
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:56.409]  There are a lot of reasons to really question that whole Big Bang Theory, and by extension, to question any assumptions made on the basis of it.
[02:03:56.409 --> 02:04:01.034]  But, you know, again, I'm not paid to be a physicist, or I haven't been a physicist for 20 years now.
[02:04:01.730 --> 02:04:02.852]  I mean, again, H.G.
[02:04:02.852 --> 02:04:06.696]  Wells, 95 years ago, wrote books about A-bombs.
[02:04:06.696 --> 02:04:19.751]  It shows that a lot of the stuff's on the books before they do it, and a lot of physicists are saying it's going to make black holes, and they believe it's going to destroy the Earth, and they're saying, yeah, it'll probably make one, but it'll just decay because the equations show this.
[02:04:21.355 --> 02:04:27.380]  Well, you know, the equations showed that epicycles would work, too, but the equations don't reflect reality.
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:32.665]  They just reflect this model, and sometimes the models are accurate, and sometimes they are not.
[02:04:32.665 --> 02:04:39.772]  I mean, don't forget, we went into Iraq with all these Pentagon computer mathematical models of how easy it was going to be to win there.
[02:04:39.772 --> 02:04:42.535]  Well, they used flawed models on the global warming front, too.
[02:04:42.535 --> 02:04:45.838]  Stay there, I promise, directly to your calls the second we come live.
[02:04:48.652 --> 02:04:51.514]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:04:51.514 --> 02:04:53.056]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:04:53.056 --> 02:04:55.217]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.

[02:04:57.119 --> 02:04:58.600]  The late great USA.
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:00.382]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:51.043]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[02:05:51.043 --> 02:05:54.786]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[02:05:54.786 --> 02:05:58.569]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[02:05:58.569 --> 02:06:05.636]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[02:06:05.996 --> 02:06:09.517]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[02:06:09.517 --> 02:06:13.718]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[02:06:13.718 --> 02:06:18.400]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.
[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:25.122]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[02:06:25.122 --> 02:06:29.643]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[02:06:29.643 --> 02:06:31.484]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?

[02:06:47.578 --> 02:06:51.701]  Hi neighbor, this is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[02:06:51.701 --> 02:06:54.224]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[02:06:55.189 --> 02:07:05.139]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[02:07:05.139 --> 02:07:10.385]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left,
[02:07:11.045 --> 02:07:19.607]  When the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[02:07:19.607 --> 02:07:27.809]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[02:07:27.809 --> 02:07:31.030]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:32.310]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:34.170]  Decide now.
[02:07:34.170 --> 02:07:35.751]  Place your bet.
[02:07:35.751 --> 02:07:37.592]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[02:07:37.592 --> 02:07:43.414]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:43.414 --> 02:07:49.696]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:07:49.696 --> 02:07:56.318]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:56.318 --> 02:07:59.299]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.022 --> 02:08:13.184]  Okay, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:13.184 --> 02:08:15.766]  Taking your calls, Dan in New York City.
[02:08:15.766 --> 02:08:20.568]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:08:20.568 --> 02:08:27.432]  On the subject of life extension technology, to extend life, you obviously need to be free of disease.
[02:08:27.432 --> 02:08:37.297]  So, I just wanted to know your opinions on the clinical research of Dr. Royal Raymond Reif, and the ability to be able to cure most microbial diseases.
[02:08:38.027 --> 02:08:47.673]  Okay, let me give you my answer to that.
[02:08:47.673 --> 02:08:52.176]  I am not a physician, either Western medicine or Eastern medicine.
[02:08:52.176 --> 02:08:58.760]  I have interviewed hundreds and hundreds of medical experts who've actually proven what they talk about.
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:00.741]  Let me be clear.
[02:09:00.741 --> 02:09:04.103]  Royal Raymond Rife was a weirdo.
[02:09:04.103 --> 02:09:05.744]  He certainly was a talented individual.
[02:09:07.734 --> 02:09:12.556]  But I'm not saying that he was wrong.
[02:09:12.556 --> 02:09:15.857]  I'm not saying he was right.
[02:09:15.857 --> 02:09:21.079]  Certainly, we know that they have frequencies and might be able to use frequencies.
[02:09:21.079 --> 02:09:28.102]  And there even are some treatments, medically, with different types of sonars and things to try to break things up.
[02:09:28.102 --> 02:09:31.003]  But there's no doubt that many of the quacks
[02:09:31.989 --> 02:09:33.349]  That then sell for $2,000, $3,000, $4,000.
[02:09:33.349 --> 02:09:36.430]  I mean, they'll sell CDs for $1,000.
[02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:41.951]  You play on a computer that flashes lights on the screen and plays music.
[02:09:41.951 --> 02:09:43.492]  I'm not here to be predatory.
[02:09:43.492 --> 02:09:44.612]  I push things I believe in.
[02:09:44.612 --> 02:09:50.433]  Guns, gold, food, silver, water filters.
[02:09:50.433 --> 02:09:52.314]  I mean, everybody knows that aloe vera is good for you.
[02:09:53.795 --> 02:10:00.336]  I mean, I grew up, you know, getting burns, and then learning how to make it feel better, when an ice cube didn't.
[02:10:00.336 --> 02:10:15.499]  And so, because the mainstream media lies and spins so much, we then tend to think that all the alternative media is telling the truth, and what it is, is a lot of people taking advantage of well-meaning patriots.
[02:10:15.499 --> 02:10:17.719]  Now, should we censor these quacks?
[02:10:17.719 --> 02:10:18.899]  No.
[02:10:18.899 --> 02:10:21.780]  Because once you start censorship, then they can use that on good people.
[02:10:22.983 --> 02:10:26.925]  But people criticize me and get upset when I say it's absolute bull.
[02:10:26.925 --> 02:10:28.987]  It is absolute bull.
[02:10:28.987 --> 02:10:36.371]  These little things you stick on cell phones, a little sticker that supposedly blocks the cell phone radiation, or changes the frequency.
[02:10:36.371 --> 02:10:38.752]  Total bull.
[02:10:38.752 --> 02:10:41.573]  And I'm sick of it.
[02:10:41.573 --> 02:10:42.274]  Now, Mike Rivero?
[02:10:43.382 --> 02:10:44.403]  Well, I absolutely agree.
[02:10:44.403 --> 02:10:48.006]  There's a lot of flummery going on out there.
[02:10:48.006 --> 02:11:07.141]  But as far as the issue of life extension and disease, I think we place too much emphasis on getting rid of all microbial diseases because it's part of our natural process that our immune system needs these small infections in order to strengthen itself and make it more able to deal with more serious diseases down the road.
[02:11:07.834 --> 02:11:19.424]  And it's kind of interesting, there's an anecdotal correlation for people who have lived the longest into the hundreds to have gone through periods of extreme ill health when they're very, very young.
[02:11:19.424 --> 02:11:20.485]  Same thing with rats.
[02:11:20.485 --> 02:11:21.986]  Same thing with rats.
[02:11:21.986 --> 02:11:23.588]  Near starvation.
[02:11:23.588 --> 02:11:26.170]  Folks, it's your genetic code that kills you.
[02:11:26.170 --> 02:11:29.273]  We're designed to die to make room for the next group.
[02:11:29.273 --> 02:11:30.334]  We're also mammals.
[02:11:30.334 --> 02:11:33.296]  We have a lot higher exchange level of hormones.
[02:11:33.296 --> 02:11:34.757]  That's why sharks don't get cancer.
[02:11:34.757 --> 02:11:35.178]  We do.
[02:11:36.138 --> 02:11:37.359]  We're dynamic creatures.
[02:11:37.359 --> 02:11:38.299]  We're warm-blooded.
[02:11:38.299 --> 02:11:40.040]  Mike, do you want to explain that?
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:51.445]  Yeah, basically, we're programmed to self-destruct because life forms that don't self-destruct tend to exhaust their food supply and become extinct very, very quickly.
[02:11:51.445 --> 02:12:00.849]  And so we have evolved a population control measure, which is that we eventually die off and make way for the ones that come after us.
[02:12:01.389 --> 02:12:02.831]  Let me explain, folks.
[02:12:02.831 --> 02:12:03.451]  Let me explain.
[02:12:03.451 --> 02:12:06.194]  It is a design for the species.
[02:12:06.194 --> 02:12:08.996]  You see, we are here for the species' health.
[02:12:08.996 --> 02:12:12.960]  That's why people think they're islands under themselves or fools.
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:15.042]  We are designed in the species.
[02:12:15.042 --> 02:12:17.404]  You're not happy until you're helping the species.
[02:12:17.404 --> 02:12:20.187]  You were designed to serve the species, Mike.
[02:12:21.317 --> 02:12:35.800]  Yeah, and the other thing to remember is that if there really was a way to extend life significantly, it's never going to be allowed onto the general public because it would trigger an immediate population explosion and a Malthusian catastrophe.
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:36.840]  It's going to be kept secret.
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:50.343]  They are getting radical extension systems, but they're finding more and more that the elites are going to be able to extend life, but not indefinitely, but they will be able to genetically mess with our DNA and to turn off the mechanisms that do that, Mike.
[02:12:51.368 --> 02:12:52.609]  Yeah, but again, it will never be alive.
[02:12:52.609 --> 02:12:58.533]  That's got to be done at the cellular level, pre-gestation, correct?
[02:12:58.533 --> 02:13:00.875]  I'm not 100% certain it's going to remain that way.
[02:13:00.875 --> 02:13:06.218]  We're starting to see gene therapies that allow for modification in matured organisms.
[02:13:06.218 --> 02:13:20.568]  That's the massive extension, but I mean, to really have something that doesn't die for thousands of years, with the current template we've got, you're going to have to have manipulation before the zygote level, with the sperm and the egg, to make those genetics work together.
[02:13:21.212 --> 02:13:22.293]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:13:22.293 --> 02:13:23.214]  We're already digressing.
[02:13:23.214 --> 02:13:25.095]  Let's go to Drew in Florida.
[02:13:25.095 --> 02:13:27.938]  You're on the air, Drew.
[02:13:27.938 --> 02:13:28.398]  Hello?
[02:13:28.398 --> 02:13:29.139]  Yes, Drew, go ahead.
[02:13:29.139 --> 02:13:29.799]  You're on the air.
[02:13:29.799 --> 02:13:31.420]  Hey there, good sir.
[02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:33.182]  Boy, you guys have some great topics.
[02:13:33.182 --> 02:13:33.882]  Where to begin?
[02:13:33.882 --> 02:13:40.728]  I called to talk about 9-11, and one topic here to my heart is actually the creation of the universe.
[02:13:40.728 --> 02:13:46.132]  So I'd love to ask questions about that, but I think I need to stick to 9-11.
[02:13:46.132 --> 02:13:48.154]  My question is, early in 2006,
[02:13:49.815 --> 02:13:53.598]  I unfortunately became involved with investigating Katrina.
[02:13:53.598 --> 02:13:58.762]  More specifically, I became interested in research regarding the levee system.
[02:13:58.762 --> 02:14:04.387]  I come to find out through several people at the Army Corps of Engineers, that basically, the levees were detonated.
[02:14:04.387 --> 02:14:08.531]  Alright, I have no problem... Well, they blew them up, they blew them up in the 20s before.
[02:14:08.531 --> 02:14:09.071]  Right.
[02:14:09.071 --> 02:14:13.795]  My thing is, I actually didn't have a problem with that.
[02:14:13.795 --> 02:14:15.016]  What I found out was,
[02:14:15.507 --> 02:14:24.233]  A company, very specifically, a company called CDI, Controlled Demolition Incorporated, was the company that physically did the actual detonation.
[02:14:24.233 --> 02:14:26.174]  Well, I don't know about that, but I'd like to hear your proof.
[02:14:26.174 --> 02:14:35.419]  We know they did Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center, but... Alex, my point is, I knew nothing about CDI before 2006.
[02:14:35.419 --> 02:14:36.060]  Nothing.
[02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:37.661]  I never even knew what that was.
[02:14:38.635 --> 02:14:50.565]  Then it took me about five minutes worth of research to know that they have their grippy little paws in absolutely every single questionable demolition over the last hundred years.
[02:14:50.565 --> 02:14:53.188]  Then I realized, what were they doing?
[02:14:53.188 --> 02:14:55.930]  And my question, this is really the big question.
[02:14:55.930 --> 02:15:03.056]  What was CDI, Controlled Demolition Incorporated, doing in New York City for six weeks prior to 9-11?
[02:15:04.133 --> 02:15:05.133]  I'd like your thoughts on that.
[02:15:05.133 --> 02:15:22.877]  Well, they even bought a major steel smelting facility six months before in New York and they weren't even contracting with truck companies previously for masses of steel and they are always the company that is hired to cover up the crime scenes and then post armed guards around it.
[02:15:22.877 --> 02:15:24.377]  Mike Rivera?
[02:15:24.377 --> 02:15:25.337]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:15:25.337 --> 02:15:28.378]  They came in and going back to the Oklahoma City bombing
[02:15:29.094 --> 02:15:56.541]  Uh, there was, uh, that strange double pulse on the seismic wave that, uh, came out from the original bombing of the Murrah Building, and then when a controlled demolition, uh, took the remains of the building down, I noted how they deliberately brought it down in two chunks to try and create a similar double pulse wave, but all they really did was confirm that there had to be two separate events, uh, regarded to the Oklahoma Building when, uh, when the first attack took place.
[02:15:57.071 --> 02:16:07.138]  Which seems consistent with the idea that there were, in fact, cutter charges inside the Murrah building that were detonated about five seconds before the main truck bomb went off.
[02:16:07.138 --> 02:16:10.181]  But yeah, they're definitely involved in all of these situations.
[02:16:10.181 --> 02:16:12.482]  They were right there in New York.
[02:16:12.482 --> 02:16:17.226]  And yeah, they very much seem to be part and parcel to a lot of these very questionable cleanups.
[02:16:17.226 --> 02:16:22.570]  I have now traced CDI over the last two years to over two dozen
[02:16:23.283 --> 02:16:31.628]  Mysterious detonations from China, to Russia, to the Congo, Indonesia, all over North America.
[02:16:31.628 --> 02:16:32.288]  And I knew nothing about it.
[02:16:32.288 --> 02:16:32.908]  Well, go back.
[02:16:32.908 --> 02:16:33.809]  How did you track them?
[02:16:33.809 --> 02:16:34.989]  I want to hear your proof.
[02:16:34.989 --> 02:16:35.870]  How did you track them?
[02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:36.870]  I mean, we know who they are.
[02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:38.071]  We know they're very wicked.
[02:16:38.071 --> 02:16:42.794]  But, I mean, how did you track them back to the levees?
[02:16:42.794 --> 02:16:44.174]  Well, I was there.
[02:16:44.174 --> 02:16:46.015]  I was at the levee system.
[02:16:46.015 --> 02:16:52.479]  I was there with several people who told me they can't tell me under some kind of bizarro strict oath
[02:16:52.990 --> 02:16:54.931]  Which, okay, whatever.
[02:16:54.931 --> 02:16:58.392]  And then the name CDI kept coming up.
[02:16:58.392 --> 02:17:00.573]  That didn't mean anything to me.
[02:17:00.573 --> 02:17:05.255]  It didn't mean anything until after I realized where this company and where they stand.
[02:17:05.255 --> 02:17:07.336]  Well, listen, write it up in an article with proof and we'll post it.
[02:17:07.336 --> 02:17:09.137]  Appreciate the call.
[02:17:09.137 --> 02:17:10.677]  David in Montana, you're on the air.
[02:17:10.677 --> 02:17:13.539]  Last call we have time for, from Mike Rivero.
[02:17:13.539 --> 02:17:14.779]  Howdy.
[02:17:14.779 --> 02:17:18.861]  Well, I don't want to get you off subject, but I did want to talk to you about something about a
[02:17:20.054 --> 02:17:22.735]  Second Amendment case that's being heard by the Supreme Court?
[02:17:22.735 --> 02:17:25.196]  Yeah, it's a gun gunner and a rule for gun control.
[02:17:25.196 --> 02:17:26.556]  Spent it as a pro-gun ruling.
[02:17:26.556 --> 02:17:28.717]  Go ahead.
[02:17:28.717 --> 02:17:42.081]  Montana Secretary of State Brad Johnson has sent a letter to the Supreme Court that guns are legal in his state under the Compact, which each party agreed to when Montana joined the Union in 1889.
[02:17:42.081 --> 02:17:42.642]  What's his name?
[02:17:42.642 --> 02:17:43.942]  I want to get him on.
[02:17:43.942 --> 02:17:44.802]  Brad Johnson.
[02:17:44.802 --> 02:17:46.763]  He's the Montana Secretary of State.
[02:17:48.089 --> 02:17:57.271]  Now that letter was signed by multiple House and Senate reps here in Montana, along with our Washington, D.C.
[02:17:57.271 --> 02:17:59.552]  rep, Denny Rehberg.
[02:17:59.552 --> 02:18:12.875]  And included in that letter says that if the Supreme Court ruling says that the Second Amendment rights apply only collectively, it would violate the contract under which Montana has entered the Union as a state.
[02:18:14.378 --> 02:18:15.760]  Yeah, it would.
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:16.642]  It would.
[02:18:16.642 --> 02:18:17.823]  We gotta jump.
[02:18:17.823 --> 02:18:21.749]  Mike, you know, them going after our guns, they just aren't going to stop pushing, are they Mike?
[02:18:22.484 --> 02:18:29.429]  No, they aren't, because, you know, in order to feel secure in their power, they're going to have to render the American people completely helpless.
[02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:33.472]  And that's more than just constant surveillance and listening to our phone calls and reading our mail.
[02:18:33.472 --> 02:18:35.574]  They've got to take away the guns.
[02:18:35.574 --> 02:18:40.778]  Otherwise, you know, at some point when we do get angry, you know, we're going to fight back.
[02:18:40.778 --> 02:18:41.498]  Right now, the U.S.
[02:18:41.498 --> 02:18:50.705]  government is in so much debt, the only way they can even think to float their loans along is to put an 80 to 90 percent aggregate tax rate on every American citizen.
[02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:54.452]  And we're already dying here at a 50% aggregate rate.
[02:18:54.452 --> 02:19:00.218]  So yeah, they're trying to figure out some way to trick us into giving up the guns.
[02:19:00.218 --> 02:19:02.220]  Boy, they're really saying the economy's melting down.
[02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:03.542]  They're now admitting it.
[02:19:03.542 --> 02:19:07.866]  That means it'll probably accelerate the precipitation of the collapse.
[02:19:07.866 --> 02:19:11.530]  I would definitely say that there's nothing they can do that's going to turn the economy around.
[02:19:11.949 --> 02:19:17.592]  Because economies are always based on making products, and we gave that ability away over the last 30 years.
[02:19:17.592 --> 02:19:18.972]  We're not going to get it back overnight.
[02:19:18.972 --> 02:19:19.253]  That's right.
[02:19:19.253 --> 02:19:22.074]  They can save Wall Street, but only nothing left.
[02:19:22.074 --> 02:19:23.455]  That's absolutely right.
[02:19:23.455 --> 02:19:26.316]  And they're going to save Wall Street at our expense.
[02:19:26.316 --> 02:19:27.477]  WhatReallyHappened.com.
[02:19:27.477 --> 02:19:29.217]  Mike, it's always wonderful having you on.
[02:19:29.217 --> 02:19:30.198]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[02:19:30.993 --> 02:19:32.754]  Look forward to doing it again next month.
[02:19:32.754 --> 02:19:35.074]  There goes Mike Rivera, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:35.074 --> 02:19:38.795]  We'll be right back with our very special guest, also joining us from Hawaii.
[02:19:38.795 --> 02:19:48.918]  Stay with us.
[02:19:48.918 --> 02:19:51.419]  It is a big idea.
[02:19:51.419 --> 02:19:53.160]  A new world order.
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:54.140]  In the near future.
[02:19:54.992 --> 02:19:58.056]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:58.056 --> 02:20:00.879]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:20:00.879 --> 02:20:03.662]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:20:03.662 --> 02:20:06.865]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:06.865 --> 02:20:14.174]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:17.199 --> 02:20:22.643]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:20:22.643 --> 02:20:26.505]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:20:26.505 --> 02:20:29.087]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:29.087 --> 02:20:30.248]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:30.248 --> 02:20:31.028]  They're not after money.
[02:20:31.028 --> 02:20:32.309]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:33.290]  They're after power.
[02:20:33.290 --> 02:20:34.431]  That's what they're after these years.
[02:20:34.431 --> 02:20:39.194]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:20:45.958 --> 02:20:47.019]  You have been warned.
[02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:49.480]  Yeah.
[02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:51.401]  Hey there, this is your radio talking.
[02:20:51.401 --> 02:20:55.142]  Have you noticed how every type of gadget these days requires some specific type of battery?
[02:20:55.142 --> 02:20:57.143]  It doesn't matter what kind of gadget you're using.
[02:20:57.143 --> 02:20:59.284]  We all take different sizes and types of batteries.
[02:20:59.284 --> 02:21:01.405]  That's where BatteryStation.com comes in.
[02:21:01.405 --> 02:21:02.645]  More like Battery Heaven.

[02:21:25.845 --> 02:21:26.305]  I think so.
[02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:56.126]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:21:56.126 --> 02:22:01.349]  An entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:12.417]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:22:12.417 --> 02:22:14.878]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:22:15.819 --> 02:22:17.560]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:23.703]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:22:39.332 --> 02:22:41.974]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[02:22:41.974 --> 02:22:47.277]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:22:48.342 --> 02:22:57.264]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:22:57.264 --> 02:23:02.425]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:23:02.425 --> 02:23:13.548]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:23:13.948 --> 02:23:19.713]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:23:19.713 --> 02:23:25.999]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:23:25.999 --> 02:23:27.020]  What about you?
[02:23:27.020 --> 02:23:31.764]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[02:23:39.368 --> 02:23:40.269]  Here they build the big guns.
[02:23:40.269 --> 02:23:41.489]  Here they build the death planes.
[02:24:04.454 --> 02:24:09.535]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:09.535 --> 02:24:15.016]  For the balance of the broadcast.
[02:24:30.509 --> 02:24:35.731]  We'll be talking to Walter L. Wagner.
[02:24:35.731 --> 02:24:46.174]  He was quoted heavily in the New York Times article asking a judge to save the world or more in their science section.
[02:24:46.174 --> 02:24:56.458]  He's got degrees in physics and biology, working with other physicists concerned about not just superconducting super colliders but other
[02:24:58.382 --> 02:25:05.205]  Devices that the different nuclear engineers and others are doing raw research with.
[02:25:05.205 --> 02:25:11.247]  And I remember 20 years ago, reading scientific papers with top physicists worried about these.
[02:25:11.247 --> 02:25:15.249]  They could create black holes, or they could create antimatter chain reactions.
[02:25:15.249 --> 02:25:17.910]  They could create unknown particles.
[02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:19.750]  And it's just Russian roulette.
[02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:23.332]  And they're doing thousands of tests a year on these different colliders alone.
[02:25:25.211 --> 02:25:28.434]  And so we are honored to have Mr. Wagner on with us.
[02:25:28.434 --> 02:25:42.725]  He and a colleague are suing because they haven't even done basic environmental assessments that you'd need to put a septic tank in at your house, much less to have these Star Trek-type systems working.
[02:25:42.725 --> 02:25:43.726]  It is 2008.
[02:25:43.726 --> 02:25:49.150]  Remember, by 1910, Max Planck and others had come up with equations for A-bombs.
[02:25:49.150 --> 02:25:52.633]  So, we're in 2008, so this is very advanced now.
[02:25:55.035 --> 02:26:00.398]  And again, we are joined by Walter Wagner, a graduate of UC Berkeley.
[02:26:00.398 --> 02:26:02.319]  Thank you for coming on with us, sir.
[02:26:02.319 --> 02:26:02.919]  Certainly, Alex.
[02:26:02.919 --> 02:26:04.040]  Thank you.
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:08.762]  First off, tell us a little bit about yourself, how you got interested in this, and why you're taking action against it.
[02:26:08.762 --> 02:26:13.544]  And then, there's a lot of bigwigs that are saying this is dangerous as well, not just you.
[02:26:13.544 --> 02:26:19.507]  Well, there are a number of people other than myself who have raised the same concerns and similar concerns.
[02:26:19.507 --> 02:26:24.070]  They don't come to the forefront of the attention of the media as
[02:26:25.271 --> 02:26:29.534]  As I have, but that doesn't mean they don't have the same concerns.
[02:26:29.534 --> 02:26:33.256]  My background started off at UC Berkeley.
[02:26:33.256 --> 02:26:35.838]  I was a physics major there initially.
[02:26:35.838 --> 02:26:40.220]  My senior year I switched to becoming a biology major, primarily for economic reasons.
[02:26:40.220 --> 02:26:42.722]  I could graduate sooner that way.
[02:26:42.722 --> 02:26:47.285]  I went back into work in physics and cosmic radiation physics at Berkeley for a couple years.
[02:26:48.078 --> 02:26:49.319]  Yeah, that's correct.
[02:26:49.319 --> 02:26:59.664]  It made the news media of the time, it was all over the world, it was published in peer-reviewed articles and so forth, and it's not been confirmed as of yet, at least not satisfactorily confirmed.
[02:27:11.388 --> 02:27:15.630]  That was a high-altitude balloon, correct?
[02:27:15.630 --> 02:27:16.850]  That is absolutely correct.
[02:27:16.850 --> 02:27:19.411]  Picking up a space-space particle before it decayed?
[02:27:19.411 --> 02:27:22.592]  Exactly.
[02:27:22.592 --> 02:27:23.032]  Exactly.
[02:27:23.032 --> 02:27:27.774]  The particle that was detected, we believe, was a magnetic monopole.
[02:27:27.774 --> 02:27:34.836]  It was a cosmic ray, the particle track that we saw, that was completely different from all the tens of thousands of other cosmic ray tracks we've previously seen.
[02:27:34.836 --> 02:27:35.216]  Interesting.
[02:27:35.216 --> 02:27:35.837]  Please continue.
[02:27:37.228 --> 02:27:46.076]  Well, anyway, after that I decided to, almost on a lark, to do law school to see what that was like.
[02:27:46.076 --> 02:27:50.420]  So I spent three years struggling through law school and then got out of that and decided that's not what I wanted to do.
[02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:59.429]  I went back to work in physics and worked in nuclear medicine, out of the nuclear medicine department in health physics, where we were using large
[02:28:01.405 --> 02:28:03.347]  So you've worked in a wide range of fields.
[02:28:03.347 --> 02:28:12.754]  When did you start getting concerned about these giant superconducting super colliders and some of those tests they were doing?
[02:28:28.177 --> 02:28:31.159]  It was about 1987 I first became concerned about it.
[02:28:31.159 --> 02:28:36.301]  I had initially been very much in favor of building larger machines.
[02:28:36.301 --> 02:28:44.004]  Back then they were not colliders, they were fixed target accelerators where you have just a single beam running into a target.
[02:28:44.004 --> 02:28:48.966]  And then I started thinking about what ultimately could happen.
[02:28:48.966 --> 02:28:55.269]  I started considering the possibility that if you continue to increase the energy of these beams,
[02:28:56.157 --> 02:28:59.706]  Uh, that eventually you might be able to create a very small tiny black hole.
[02:29:00.667 --> 02:29:05.650]  And I didn't know what that threshold would be that it would take to do that.
[02:29:05.650 --> 02:29:07.091]  Let me just stop you.
[02:29:07.091 --> 02:29:10.013]  Are these the same type of black holes that they collect?
[02:29:10.013 --> 02:29:10.694]  Well, stay there.
[02:29:10.694 --> 02:29:17.738]  We'll come right back, because I have AP, Scientists Create Artificial Black Hole in Lab, and it says they were using a collider to do this.
[02:29:17.738 --> 02:29:23.902]  You, I found out like 15 years ago, had said that this might happen, and now they're saying they've actually made them.
[02:29:23.902 --> 02:29:26.244]  Or is that a different type of black hole?
[02:29:26.244 --> 02:29:27.785]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[02:29:27.785 --> 02:29:28.846]  Talk about the dangers.
[02:29:29.786 --> 02:29:45.657]  Of these type of systems on the other side of this quick break right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:29:48.757 --> 02:29:54.219]  It's progressing, and it's only a short time until it's completely taken over every aspect of your life.
[02:29:54.219 --> 02:29:56.119]  We are entering martial law.
[02:29:56.119 --> 02:29:58.820]  There are ten telling signs of martial law.
[02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:00.540]  America has them all.
[02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:05.022]  Use the short time left to protect you and your family with the vital information in this book.

[02:30:13.146 --> 02:30:18.631]  Know exactly what you'll need to have hidden to live and how to survive under severe martial law.
[02:30:18.631 --> 02:30:21.694]  The worst part of martial law is in the beginning stages.
[02:30:21.694 --> 02:30:28.460]  SurviveMartialLaw.com will show you how to act around controlling troops, where to store life-saving supplies, and what to look for.
[02:30:29.261 --> 02:30:31.984]  Surviving can be difficult, but possible.
[02:30:31.984 --> 02:30:36.668]  Arm yourself with the knowledge, as this is the only weapon you will have to protect your family.

[02:30:48.717 --> 02:30:54.820]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:30:54.820 --> 02:31:00.143]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:31:00.143 --> 02:31:06.507]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[02:31:06.527 --> 02:31:06.927]  I think so.

[02:33:27.524 --> 02:33:32.066]  We're back live with that message in a bottle.
[02:33:32.066 --> 02:33:37.888]  Chernobyl, the monarch butterflies being sterilized by some of the GMO crops.
[02:33:37.888 --> 02:33:39.749]  Look at all the disaster science has created.
[02:33:39.749 --> 02:33:41.350]  I love science.
[02:33:41.350 --> 02:33:44.031]  But we need to be careful.
[02:33:44.031 --> 02:33:50.173]  And we're talking to a gentleman who's a physicist, biologist, worked in many different fields, and they filed a lawsuit to block
[02:33:51.233 --> 02:33:55.698]  Uh, the biggest superkinetic supercollider in the world, I guess.
[02:33:55.698 --> 02:33:59.723]  That's the modern name from the primitive cyclotrons.
[02:33:59.723 --> 02:34:02.326]  But where they can even create new elements.
[02:34:02.326 --> 02:34:06.110]  Please continue, sir, just the basics of these, why you believe they're dangerous.
[02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:10.115]  There's a lot of other experts that also think that it's dangerous as well.
[02:34:12.304 --> 02:34:29.455]  Well, they are cyclotrons, and what they have done now is instead of running the cyclotron into a fixed target, they now run the beam into each other head-on, and they are increasing the amount of energy that's available for new particle production.
[02:34:29.455 --> 02:34:33.117]  And that's the entire purpose of this, is to try to create new particles.
[02:34:35.064 --> 02:34:41.646]  And this LHC machine is going to be the most energetic particle collider ever built.
[02:34:41.646 --> 02:34:51.649]  It's basically about the size of the superconducting supercollider that was under construction there in Texas, that was stopped for financial primarily reasons.
[02:34:53.079 --> 02:34:56.261]  It's being built by the same people, in essence.
[02:34:56.261 --> 02:35:00.082]  It's the Fermilab people who have constructed the magnet.
[02:35:00.082 --> 02:35:04.444]  Why did DARPA and the Defense Department decide to not do it in the U.S.?
[02:35:04.444 --> 02:35:07.425]  Why did they move to the EU?
[02:35:07.425 --> 02:35:10.166]  I think it was for financial reasons.
[02:35:10.166 --> 02:35:15.088]  They had to start from scratch, digging the tunnel and so forth.
[02:35:15.088 --> 02:35:19.630]  There was already an existing tunnel from a previous electron-positron collider
[02:35:20.582 --> 02:35:29.084]  Already in existence in Switzerland, so they scrapped that machine, took out all of its works, and used the same tunnel.
[02:35:29.084 --> 02:35:32.865]  So that saved quite a lot of money.
[02:35:32.865 --> 02:35:39.787]  But they're using the exact same superconducting magnets built by Fermilab.
[02:35:39.787 --> 02:35:44.628]  That's one of the reasons why Fermilab is named as one of the defendants, and that's what gives the U.S.
[02:35:44.628 --> 02:35:46.189]  Court's jurisdiction over the case.
[02:35:48.112 --> 02:36:00.464]  But back to the colliders, by colliding these beams head on into each other, you are able to generate far more energy available for particle production, and they are hoping to create new kinds of particles.
[02:36:00.464 --> 02:36:10.033]  It's sometimes called the God Machine, because one of the particles that they are looking to create has been called the God Particle, the Higgs Boson.
[02:36:11.173 --> 02:36:14.176]  There are other particles that they think they might be able to create.
[02:36:14.176 --> 02:36:16.118]  Tell the listeners what a Higgs boson is.
[02:36:16.118 --> 02:36:27.511]  It's a field theory that would ascribe the reason for all other particles having the property of mass.
[02:36:28.610 --> 02:36:34.635]  And so they believe that there is a fundamental carrier for that field called the Higgs boson.
[02:36:34.635 --> 02:36:36.897]  Now let's boil this down.
[02:36:36.897 --> 02:36:43.462]  With primitive hundred year old equations, hundred year old ladies and gentlemen, they are able to make A-bombs with
[02:36:44.082 --> 02:36:44.563]  Yes, uh, the uh...
[02:37:01.929 --> 02:37:11.635]  The LHC is going to accelerate lead atoms and run them into each other head-on, much like two cars running into each other head-on.
[02:37:11.635 --> 02:37:18.259]  It will cause them to stop right there in the center of the machine, relatively stationary relative to Earth.
[02:37:18.259 --> 02:37:20.020]  And that's the problem.
[02:37:20.020 --> 02:37:31.106]  In nature, when these high-energy particles come streaming in and hit the upper atmosphere, for example, anything new that's created keeps on going through the Earth at the speed of light.
[02:37:31.944 --> 02:37:33.065]  I think so.
[02:37:53.364 --> 02:37:57.568]  By creating one that's at rest, it gives it that opportunity to do that.
[02:37:57.568 --> 02:38:00.370]  It would be captured by Earth's gravity, it would remain in the Earth.
[02:38:00.370 --> 02:38:01.090]  Let's explain.
[02:38:01.090 --> 02:38:04.533]  We have high-mass particles being accelerated at each other.
[02:38:04.533 --> 02:38:10.798]  They're going to be sitting there, able, with their own gravitational pull, to begin accruing mass.
[02:38:10.798 --> 02:38:15.702]  Well, they would not so much from its own gravitational attraction accrete mass.
[02:38:15.702 --> 02:38:18.924]  It would just be by physical contact, by touching something.
[02:38:18.924 --> 02:38:22.087]  Anything it would touch would become part of it, become part of the black hole.
[02:38:23.130 --> 02:38:33.374]  And so in nature if they travel through the earth and they touch a single atom in the process of doing that, it will capture that atom and it will exit through the earth and won't be done otherwise.
[02:38:33.374 --> 02:38:39.336]  Because it's been accelerated naturally by the... It's going at the speed of light naturally.
[02:38:39.336 --> 02:38:42.957]  Here we're trying to create them at rest, not moving.
[02:38:44.502 --> 02:39:01.699]  Now, does this tie into them, because again, I saw you back in the late 80s, early 90s, mid 90s, talking about this could make black holes back then, and others agreeing with you, other physicists, now they claim that they've made black holes, or is that a separate thing?
[02:39:01.699 --> 02:39:07.445]  That, Rick, they've created something that has similar properties to a black hole.
[02:39:08.925 --> 02:39:11.367]  But it wasn't a black hole, per se.
[02:39:11.367 --> 02:39:18.632]  It was actually a quark-gluon plasma, which would be a precursor to a creation of a different kind of a particle called a strangelet.
[02:39:18.632 --> 02:39:25.758]  And that's another possibility, that it could create strangelets by colliding the lead nuclei into each other.
[02:39:25.758 --> 02:39:27.860]  That's something that doesn't occur in nature.
[02:39:27.860 --> 02:39:30.722]  In nature, you have high-energy protons striking the Earth,
[02:39:32.258 --> 02:39:38.963]  And what this LHC machine will do is it will have high-energy lead nuclei running into each other head-on.
[02:39:38.963 --> 02:39:40.404]  That just never happens at NATO.
[02:39:40.404 --> 02:39:44.627]  Now, I'm just a novice here, but I've been reading over what other scientists and physicists are worried about.
[02:39:44.627 --> 02:39:47.789]  What about it just creating new particles that react?
[02:39:47.789 --> 02:39:54.395]  I mean, they say they don't know what it's going to make, and they continue to smash these into each other ad infinitum.
[02:39:54.395 --> 02:40:00.099]  What about it creating... I mean, I know the Air Force is on record saying they've isolated antimatter, then they classified that.
[02:40:01.556 --> 02:40:05.559]  Well, we don't know what other kinds of new particles it could be created.
[02:40:05.559 --> 02:40:06.580]  You're absolutely correct.
[02:40:06.580 --> 02:40:12.804]  You know, I put on my thinking cap and I came up with the idea that maybe it'll create a black hole.
[02:40:12.804 --> 02:40:17.328]  This was confirmed by a number of other theorists who said, yes, this is not such a far-fetched idea.
[02:40:17.328 --> 02:40:18.889]  It might make a black hole.
[02:40:18.889 --> 02:40:20.790]  We don't know that it will, but we don't know that it will.
[02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:23.592]  Well, Hawking agreed with you, but he said it would fall apart.
[02:40:23.592 --> 02:40:25.134]  Why does he say that?
[02:40:25.134 --> 02:40:27.555]  Well, he's got a theory that
[02:40:29.148 --> 02:40:41.080]  Quantum fluctuations in the vacuum would allow for some of the, uh, a particle fall into a micro black hole while the other one escapes, and that this could possibly allow them to evaporate.
[02:40:41.639 --> 02:40:52.944]  And that's what basically the safety review that was done previously for the LHC said, well, we don't have to worry about these micro black holes because we know they will evaporate.
[02:40:52.944 --> 02:40:54.644]  Well, we don't know that they will evaporate.
[02:40:54.644 --> 02:40:56.165]  That's a theory or an idea.
[02:40:56.165 --> 02:40:59.446]  But Hawking has admitted that he's been wrong about theories before.
[02:40:59.446 --> 02:41:05.049]  Yes, he has admitted that, and there are a number of theorists who believe that this theory is wrong, flat-out wrong.
[02:41:05.049 --> 02:41:08.290]  Not just, you know, it's a nice idea, but it's flat-out wrong for a number of other reasons.
[02:41:09.419 --> 02:41:13.241]  Whether it's wrong or not, I don't know that I can say for certain.
[02:41:13.241 --> 02:41:14.702]  Well, tell us about a strangelet.
[02:41:14.702 --> 02:41:18.143]  Tell us about a strangelet.
[02:41:18.143 --> 02:41:25.526]  Okay, a strangelet is a kind of a particle that is one of the ones that they think they might be able to create.
[02:41:25.526 --> 02:41:30.549]  When you slam these two atoms into each other, it creates what's called a quark-gluon plasma.
[02:41:30.549 --> 02:41:33.270]  The protons and the neutrons are made out of quarks.
[02:41:34.541 --> 02:41:36.542]  Up quarks and down quarks.
[02:41:36.542 --> 02:41:43.786]  But when you put them together, they have about a thousand times more energy than the rest mass of the particle itself.
[02:41:43.786 --> 02:41:47.728]  That allows it to create a lot more kinds of quarks.
[02:41:47.728 --> 02:41:51.650]  Some of the kinds of quarks it would create would be strange quarks.
[02:41:51.650 --> 02:42:01.376]  It's believed that these can then rearrange themselves and form a new kind of a nucleus, a new kind of atom, called a strangelet, that's made out of up, down, and strange quarks.
[02:42:01.376 --> 02:42:03.517]  And this new kind of atom is more stable
[02:42:04.073 --> 02:42:04.433]  I think so.
[02:42:26.505 --> 02:42:34.969]  But eventually it too would fall to the center of the Earth because anything it touches, because part of it, can't stop it from falling.
[02:42:34.969 --> 02:42:40.412]  And so eventually it would grow larger and larger inside the center of the Earth and cause our planet to explode.
[02:42:40.412 --> 02:42:42.013]  They might not even discover it.
[02:42:42.013 --> 02:42:45.454]  It could form in the hundreds of miles of tunnels anywhere.
[02:42:45.454 --> 02:42:46.175]  That's possible.
[02:42:46.175 --> 02:42:50.417]  If it's neutral and charged when it's formed, we would never detect it.
[02:42:50.417 --> 02:42:51.017]  Wow, wonderful.
[02:42:52.299 --> 02:43:00.824]  And the problem is, I've been reading all weekend over the equations, what other physicists are saying, they agree with you and come up with even more horrible scenarios.
[02:43:00.824 --> 02:43:09.769]  And it seems that the more tests they do, numbering in the thousands per collider, it just starts increasing the probability that something's going to happen.
[02:43:09.769 --> 02:43:15.712]  Well, that's our concern, is that there has been no refutation of these theories.
[02:43:15.712 --> 02:43:19.334]  It's basically a plain Russian roulette.
[02:43:19.334 --> 02:43:20.935]  And we don't know how many chambers there are.
[02:43:21.488 --> 02:43:24.089]  Uh, and how many bullets we're putting in the chambers.
[02:43:24.089 --> 02:43:30.213]  Uh, and, and, uh, it's, it's, it's hoping that nothing goes wrong.
[02:43:30.213 --> 02:43:31.893]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:43:31.893 --> 02:43:40.418]  While we look for more information about the universe, you know, that's why it's called the God Machine, because these people believe that this won't answer all of their questions.
[02:43:40.418 --> 02:43:44.380]  Well, it will answer a few questions, uh, and some questions.
[02:43:44.969 --> 02:43:48.173]  It certainly won't answer all the other questions the other scientists are working on.
[02:43:48.173 --> 02:43:51.897]  Well I say this, it's too dangerous for the future of the species.
[02:43:51.897 --> 02:44:01.848]  I mean if they want to develop some super expensive program in the future and take it out to the asteroid belt or something, which still I know wouldn't make us safe, but I mean they just don't need to be doing this on the planet.
[02:44:02.388 --> 02:44:10.115]  You've got the same thing with GMO and these DNA guns randomly firing into things already giving rise to super viruses.
[02:44:10.115 --> 02:44:12.217]  They've got prehistoric viruses now.
[02:44:12.217 --> 02:44:17.322]  I've had, again, Nobel Prize winners on about this coming out and they just cover it up quietly.
[02:44:17.322 --> 02:44:25.670]  And what is it about the scientific community that they're just pell-mell, wildly just playing God, like sticking their you-know-what's in light sockets?
[02:44:26.431 --> 02:44:38.617]  Well, to a certain degree, you know, that's one of the reasons we filed one of the affidavits was from a psychologist who actually has a background in biochemistry and astrophysics.
[02:44:38.617 --> 02:44:43.139]  But he's also professionally a psychologist, and he's analyzed the psychology of it.
[02:44:43.139 --> 02:44:50.183]  It's a desire, in large part, not only just to find knowledge, it's a desire for selfishness to find out this knowledge for yourself.
[02:44:50.183 --> 02:44:51.764]  It's gambling!
[02:44:51.764 --> 02:44:54.305]  And willing to risk other people's lives to do it.
[02:44:55.515 --> 02:45:01.812]  Yeah, I hadn't read his findings, but it's power mad, playing god, control freak gambling.
[02:45:01.812 --> 02:45:02.695]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:45:04.239 --> 02:45:16.268]  And that's why we filed the suit, and that's why we want to have a thorough safety study that we can then evaluate, criticize, and take back to the court and say, here are the other flaws we found in this safety study.
[02:45:16.268 --> 02:45:17.329]  Well, and here's the problem.
[02:45:17.329 --> 02:45:25.815]  If you don't stop them now, it'll be bigger and bigger and bigger colliders, and more and more energy, and then there are a lot of other weird subatomic systems too, aren't there?
[02:45:26.275 --> 02:45:29.799]  There are already plans on the drawing board for even larger colliders.
[02:45:29.799 --> 02:45:31.060]  They aren't even satisfied.
[02:45:31.060 --> 02:45:33.682]  You know, they figure, well, we won't find everything we need to know.
[02:45:33.682 --> 02:45:35.324]  We need to make a bigger one.
[02:45:35.324 --> 02:45:42.050]  So, yes, there are already plans for additional colliders and an international linear collider and so forth.
[02:45:43.829 --> 02:45:48.150]  Well, I love technology, and I want us to go to space, and I believe a lot of money should be spent on it.
[02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:53.192]  The problem is, we have this, our main sciences were taken over by eugenicists a hundred years ago.
[02:45:53.192 --> 02:45:57.813]  They have this elitist attitude, they're in control now, and frankly, they're nuts.
[02:45:57.813 --> 02:46:09.677]  I mean, you study the mainline elite, they are nuttier than a fruitcake, and I know you've been around them, and I mean, I just don't understand why they're endangering everything humanity has built
[02:46:10.297 --> 02:46:12.178]  Just crazily.
[02:46:12.178 --> 02:46:14.240]  I mean, again, look at Chernobyl.
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:15.601]  Look at the atomic bomb.
[02:46:15.601 --> 02:46:20.524]  That is ancient stuff, comparatively, and our technology is doubling every few years.
[02:46:20.524 --> 02:46:22.145]  Where do you see this going?
[02:46:22.145 --> 02:46:29.450]  Well, I don't want to necessarily criticize these people as being bad scientists in that sense.
[02:46:29.450 --> 02:46:31.992]  I think that they were well-intentioned, but misguided.
[02:46:31.992 --> 02:46:38.657]  They had a certain belief system, and as that's been shown to be faulty, they are
[02:46:39.315 --> 02:46:47.144]  It is very arrogant to say that we're right and you're wrong when I have every bit as much if not more academic background than do they.
[02:46:58.417 --> 02:47:01.939]  Well, let's talk about some of the other prestigious physicists.
[02:47:01.939 --> 02:47:04.060]  There's a big list of them I have.
[02:47:04.060 --> 02:47:11.404]  And, you know, the top people in the Royal Academy and others, you know, 20 years ago saying they were worried about these accelerators.
[02:47:12.748 --> 02:47:22.337]  Well, I haven't necessarily looked through the list as to who all has come out saying that they don't think it's a good idea.
[02:47:22.337 --> 02:47:29.363]  And like you said, this was 20 years ago, so they may have changed their views or they may have passed away and so forth.
[02:47:29.363 --> 02:47:32.086]  I have to go with the people here and now who are able to
[02:47:34.027 --> 02:47:43.991]  I've been speaking with physicists in Germany who have excellent academic background, credentials in cosmic radiation physics, astrophysics, who share the same concerns.
[02:47:43.991 --> 02:47:48.893]  What I found is that, generally speaking, nobody really wants to stick their neck out
[02:47:50.027 --> 02:48:00.315]  And go against a gargantuan institution like Fern, because it's the academic kiss of death, so to speak, if you do that publicly.
[02:48:00.315 --> 02:48:06.060]  Yet privately, I've had a number of communications from a large number of people saying, yes, we really support what you're doing.
[02:48:06.060 --> 02:48:07.641]  So that's what keeps me going.
[02:48:07.641 --> 02:48:14.147]  I was grateful to be able to get seven of us to file affidavits in support of this.
[02:48:14.147 --> 02:48:16.609]  Tell me about your colleague who's working on this with you.
[02:48:17.897 --> 02:48:27.023]  Dr. Sancho is a professor, formerly a professor in Spain, at the University of Barcelona.
[02:48:27.023 --> 02:48:35.568]  He works in system science, which is trying to integrate the fields of physics and biology.
[02:48:35.568 --> 02:48:39.510]  He is extremely well-read in theoretical physics.
[02:48:42.086 --> 02:48:59.873]  He independently, I suppose, came up with these concerns regarding the collider, and when he started reading about me on a number of blogs I posted on the internet, he got in touch with me a couple years ago, and we started communicating extensively about this.
[02:48:59.873 --> 02:49:02.874]  Yeah, I want to get him on and get his take on things.
[02:49:02.874 --> 02:49:04.015]  He speaks pretty good English, doesn't he?
[02:49:04.973 --> 02:49:05.714]  Fairly good English.
[02:49:05.714 --> 02:49:07.054]  He has a slight accent.
[02:49:07.054 --> 02:49:08.155]  He's from Spain.
[02:49:08.155 --> 02:49:09.215]  Yeah, I can get you his number.
[02:49:09.215 --> 02:49:09.315]  Sure.
[02:49:09.315 --> 02:49:14.758]  Well, I want to get him on with you in the near future for a full hour.
[02:49:14.758 --> 02:49:15.238]  Other concerns?
[02:49:15.238 --> 02:49:18.280]  Other facets that people should know about, sir?
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:18.840]  Yeah, a couple of things.
[02:49:30.408 --> 02:49:45.235]  Initially, when this issue first came up in 1999, I had that letter to Scientific American, and I raised the prospect that it might be able to create micro black holes, but I really didn't know, and I wanted to get some additional input from other people.
[02:49:45.235 --> 02:49:50.698]  And it was sort of roundly, say, this guy's a nut for saying that it might create a micro black hole.
[02:49:50.698 --> 02:49:51.658]  That's impossible.
[02:49:51.658 --> 02:49:55.440]  We know from our knowledge of physics that this can't happen, and so forth.
[02:49:55.856 --> 02:50:05.659]  Well, within two or three years, a number of theoretical papers came out saying that, yes, indeed, under some conditions of physics, this might well happen, that you might be able to create a micro black hole.
[02:50:05.659 --> 02:50:09.540]  And at that point, they turned around and said, well, we're going to try to create micro black holes.
[02:50:09.540 --> 02:50:11.001]  This will be some interesting physics.
[02:50:13.065 --> 02:50:16.489]  So your question spurred them trying to make these?
[02:50:16.489 --> 02:50:19.792]  Yes, it turns out that it did.
[02:50:19.792 --> 02:50:23.455]  Well, it spurred out a justification for what they were doing.
[02:50:23.455 --> 02:50:29.661]  It was already underway, but they started using this as a justification to continue their funding.
[02:50:29.661 --> 02:50:30.202]  Stay there.
[02:50:30.202 --> 02:50:30.782]  Final segment.
[02:50:30.782 --> 02:50:31.743]  I want to hear more about this.
[02:50:31.743 --> 02:50:33.785]  I mean, that's these nuts.
[02:50:33.785 --> 02:50:35.306]  Oh, you can make black holes.
[02:50:35.306 --> 02:50:36.067]  Let's do it.
[02:50:36.067 --> 02:50:36.588]  Oh, yes.
[02:50:37.388 --> 02:50:38.870]  Wonderful!
[02:50:38.870 --> 02:50:40.532]  I'll really be powerful.
[02:50:40.532 --> 02:50:42.754]  Yeah, and you'll live one micron of a second.
[02:50:42.754 --> 02:50:49.262]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:49.262 --> 02:50:50.664]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:50.664 --> 02:50:53.507]  A new world order.
[02:50:53.507 --> 02:50:57.872]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:58.396 --> 02:51:01.199]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:01.199 --> 02:51:04.003]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:51:04.003 --> 02:51:07.186]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:07.186 --> 02:51:14.495]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:17.535 --> 02:51:22.959]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:22.959 --> 02:51:26.841]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:26.841 --> 02:51:29.403]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:51:29.403 --> 02:51:30.584]  Most people have no idea.
[02:51:30.584 --> 02:51:31.364]  They're not after money.
[02:51:31.364 --> 02:51:32.625]  They have all the money they need.
[02:51:32.625 --> 02:51:33.606]  They're after power.
[02:51:33.606 --> 02:51:34.767]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:52:41.408 --> 02:52:41.588]  That's 646-498-5309.
[02:52:48.069 --> 02:52:48.529]  Fact.
[02:52:48.529 --> 02:52:54.574]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:52:54.574 --> 02:52:58.917]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:52:58.917 --> 02:53:06.643]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:53:06.643 --> 02:53:07.404]  The solution.
[02:53:07.404 --> 02:53:11.627]  Detoxification integrated with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:53:11.627 --> 02:53:13.629]  The LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:53:13.729 --> 02:53:14.109]  I think so.
[02:53:32.930 --> 02:53:33.550]  We're good.
[02:53:57.597 --> 02:54:01.518]  We're going to get Mr. Wagner's colleague, Mr. Sancho, on in the next few weeks.
[02:54:01.518 --> 02:54:07.220]  We'll get both of them back up for a full hour to explore this in a deeper way.
[02:54:07.220 --> 02:54:20.184]  I just want to make the point that about half the, this is mainstream news, half the people working on the A-bomb, the physicists thought it would ignite the atmosphere, but they went ahead with it.
[02:54:20.184 --> 02:54:26.066]  Now, they weren't right, but the point is that even though they thought it would ignite the atmosphere and burn the surface of the Earth,
[02:54:26.855 --> 02:54:29.117]  They still did it.
[02:54:29.117 --> 02:54:32.880]  And we know they blew holes in the ozone layer with the hydrogen bombs they detonated.
[02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:36.042]  They detonated hundreds in the high and low atmosphere.
[02:54:36.042 --> 02:54:39.605]  Our own government did.
[02:54:39.605 --> 02:54:43.748]  Going back to Walter L. Wagner, I want to give out the website.
[02:54:43.748 --> 02:54:47.150]  It's got a lot of documentation, a lot of information on it.
[02:54:47.150 --> 02:54:48.011]  Give that out, please, sir.
[02:54:48.556 --> 02:54:53.879]  Yeah, that's L-H-C-Defense.org.
[02:54:53.879 --> 02:54:57.882]  L as in Larry, H as in Harry, C as in Charlie.
[02:54:57.882 --> 02:54:58.662]  Defense.
[02:54:58.662 --> 02:55:01.544]  D-E-F-E-N-F-E dot org.
[02:55:01.544 --> 02:55:05.466]  And that stands for Large Hadron Collider.
[02:55:05.466 --> 02:55:09.729]  Absolutely, so L-H-C-Defense dot O-R-G.
[02:55:09.729 --> 02:55:11.830]  Okay, we've got a few minutes left.
[02:55:11.830 --> 02:55:17.033]  Other things that the equations and theories show that this could potentially form?
[02:55:18.528 --> 02:55:38.537]  Yeah, some people think it might create a magnetic monopole, and that might thereafter engage in catalyzing the protons of our normal atoms and create converting all of matter into some other kind of matter.
[02:55:38.537 --> 02:55:40.398]  I don't know too much about that theory.
[02:55:40.398 --> 02:55:47.741]  There's another theory out there that it could cause a collapse or a penetration of an energy barrier between our universe and a
[02:55:48.382 --> 02:55:54.003]  Well, I don't know that they predicted that that would occur, but certainly they do have observed that hexagon up there.
[02:55:54.003 --> 02:55:55.884]  It's a very unusual pattern.
[02:56:14.491 --> 02:56:18.374]  I'm very much in favor of all kinds of science and scientific endeavors.
[02:56:18.374 --> 02:56:25.199]  I really want to see... We've got a satellite launch coming up in May called the GLAST, G-L-A-S-T, satellite.
[02:56:25.199 --> 02:56:31.183]  It's going to have the potential for being able to search for what's called Hawking radiation.
[02:56:31.183 --> 02:56:36.988]  It might be able to help answer some of the questions that need to be answered first before we operate the LHC.
[02:56:36.988 --> 02:56:42.712]  There's a new cosmic ray detector in Argentina called the TIER-ALGER, A-U-G-E-R,
[02:56:43.747 --> 02:56:46.770]  Uh, and it came online a couple years ago.
[02:56:46.770 --> 02:56:50.853]  It's purely passive, like any observatory.
[02:56:50.853 --> 02:56:56.838]  Here in Hawaii, we have lots of observatories on our mountain, Mount Akea, for observing the universe.
[02:56:56.838 --> 02:57:02.283]  Very much in favor of acquiring more knowledge and information for us, but it has to be done in a safe manner.
[02:57:03.405 --> 02:57:07.966]  All right, up on InfoWars.com we have a link to your website.
[02:57:07.966 --> 02:57:09.906]  I hope people will support what you're doing.
[02:57:09.906 --> 02:57:15.887]  Any news on how effective you'll be in blocking them, firing this up?
[02:57:15.887 --> 02:57:20.228]  Well, that's always speculative when you take something before a judge.
[02:57:20.228 --> 02:57:28.689]  I believe, though, that with the news media attention this is drawing, and the fact that they have not come out with this most recent safety study.
[02:57:28.689 --> 02:57:31.670]  They promised us a safety study by January 1.
[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:33.280]  They didn't deliver.
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:36.641]  On January 31, I emailed them.
[02:57:36.641 --> 02:57:41.643]  They sent me an email back saying they would be available by the end of February.
[02:57:41.643 --> 02:57:42.403]  They didn't deliver.
[02:57:42.403 --> 02:57:50.866]  So now they're way behind the gun on this, and I think the reason they've not delivered is they recognize that there's some fundamental flaws.
[02:57:51.626 --> 02:57:54.288]  And they haven't been able to come up with a way around it yet.
[02:57:54.288 --> 02:57:57.870]  So you're spurring a real debate regardless inside the institution?
[02:57:57.870 --> 02:57:59.671]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:57:59.671 --> 02:58:05.775]  And they're going to, because they don't have that out, I think the judge is going to grant a TRO.
[02:58:05.775 --> 02:58:10.197]  Alright, we really appreciate you coming on.
[02:58:10.197 --> 02:58:13.399]  Dr. Wagner, we'll talk to you again in the near future and your colleague.
[02:58:13.399 --> 02:58:17.542]  I hope folks visit the website up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:58:17.542 --> 02:58:17.902]  Take care.
[02:58:18.604 --> 02:58:19.104]  Okay, Alex.
[02:58:19.104 --> 02:58:19.344]  Thanks.
[02:58:19.344 --> 02:58:20.064]  Nice speaking with you.
[02:58:20.064 --> 02:58:20.244]  Bye-bye.
[02:58:20.244 --> 02:58:21.125]  Have a good day.
[02:58:21.125 --> 02:58:22.285]  Thank you.
