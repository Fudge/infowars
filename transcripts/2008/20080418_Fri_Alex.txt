[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.910]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:02.510]  Welcome.
[00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.390]  It is Friday.
[00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:35.905]  The 18th day of April 2008.
[00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:44.411]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours and let me tell you about who we have joining us on the transmission today.
[00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:52.476]  Gold went up even more today and futures has it going up another four or five dollars in the next week.
[00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:56.758]  So moving back towards that thousand dollar mark quite rapidly.
[00:00:56.758 --> 00:01:00.721]  Bob Chapman will be on to talk to us about that and now mainstream news
[00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.053]  I'm starting to not talk about recession, admitting we're in recession, and moving on to depression talk.
[00:01:08.053 --> 00:01:10.814]  And the bigger issue will be, what will the U.S.
[00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:12.875]  look like if there is a depression?
[00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.417]  How will the population respond?
[00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:21.840]  And is that why they've got the FEMA camps prepared and the police trained for martial law?
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.542]  Bob Chapman, financial expert, will be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:30.704]  William Lewis, from one to three for two hours, his new film,
[00:01:31.503 --> 00:01:33.003]  It just came out about a week ago.
[00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:35.444]  I had a chance to see it a couple nights ago.
[00:01:35.444 --> 00:01:40.905]  We immediately began carrying it, and William had us 600 of these shipped within two days.
[00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:42.866]  They just arrived yesterday.
[00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:47.987]  They are now up on the Infowars.com shopping cart.
[00:01:47.987 --> 00:01:50.368]  Washington, you're fired!
[00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:56.789]  And I have to say, it's what I'd call America Freedom to Fascism 2.
[00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.610]  But it's even got better editing, better cameras are used,
[00:02:00.965 --> 00:02:02.707]  I'm not saying it's better than Freedom to Fascism.
[00:02:02.707 --> 00:02:07.850]  I would say it's a nice part two, or it's a nice complement to it.
[00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.254]  And we need this film to be as big as America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:02:13.254 --> 00:02:30.065]  William Lewis, of course, did a great job on films like America Under Siege and another film that he did with Joyce Riley that was along the lines of what's happening with the secret testing on the American people.
[00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.608]  Beyond Treason.
[00:02:32.608 --> 00:02:35.149]  And you can see how great his editing and work is there.
[00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.511]  And he's now off on his own, making films entirely on his own.
[00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.212]  And I think this is his best film, Washington.
[00:02:41.212 --> 00:02:44.554]  You are fired!
[00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:45.475]  And we will have him on.
[00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:48.636]  We'll play some audio clips today from the film.
[00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:50.937]  The video trailer is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.699]  William Lewis will be joining us today.
[00:02:54.443 --> 00:02:57.204]  Coming up in the third and fourth hour.
[00:02:57.204 --> 00:03:06.147]  There's now a fourth hour and officially next week we will be on the network for the four hours.
[00:03:06.147 --> 00:03:08.388]  Starting next week from 11 a.m.
[00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:10.409]  till 3 p.m.
[00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.070]  Central Standard Time.
[00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.772]  You will be able to tune in and hear the show for four hours.
[00:03:20.447 --> 00:03:24.029]  Yesterday I went for four and a half hours.
[00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.671]  No, it was four hours, fifty minutes, I think.
[00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:29.493]  Some days I go two hours over and make it a five-hour show.
[00:03:29.493 --> 00:03:33.916]  Some days I've gotten close to six hours, but it'll be locked in four hours
[00:03:35.103 --> 00:03:46.237]  Official on the network and some days you can be assured I'll go into hyper overdrive myself with my own Studio here my own phone numbers here, and I'll go over sometimes sometimes.
[00:03:46.237 --> 00:03:53.406]  We'll have exclusive guests We will still have overtime pushing the show past four hours Now
[00:03:55.003 --> 00:04:02.829]  You can always listen for free on the internet at InfoWars.com to the radio show.
[00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.473]  They're on the internet streams if it's not on your AM or FM dial or shortwave or satellite.
[00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:16.498]  And you can see the video in the fourth hour and beyond when you have a PrisonPlanet.tv membership for 15 cents a day.
[00:04:16.498 --> 00:04:17.379]  The document cam
[00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:28.331]  The guest cam, the cam on me, an internet cam feed where we play videos, and we show you the articles we're covering.
[00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:41.802]  And of course you then get all 18 of my films in super high quality, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, my best audio interviews, PrisonPlanet.TV, now even more reasons to be a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[00:04:43.243 --> 00:04:48.966]  I'm going to try not to get upset today because my back is out of alignment in my neck.
[00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:51.568]  But the news I've got is unbelievable.
[00:04:51.568 --> 00:04:52.528]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:04:52.528 --> 00:04:56.111]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:59.473]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:05:00.774 --> 00:05:03.835]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:03.835 --> 00:05:06.676]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:09.458]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:12.639]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:19.962]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.987 --> 00:05:28.431]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:32.313]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:32.313 --> 00:05:34.875]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:36.036]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:36.836]  They're not after money.
[00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.117]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:38.117 --> 00:05:39.098]  They're after power.
[00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:40.239]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:44.982]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:05:44.982 --> 00:05:48.964]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:48.964 --> 00:05:51.766]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:51.766 --> 00:05:52.807]  You have been warned.
[00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.482]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:58.003]  I'm the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:05:58.003 --> 00:06:01.045]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:06:01.045 --> 00:06:01.806]  is a real thing.
[00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:08.811]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer from fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:19.818]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[00:06:19.818 --> 00:06:23.080]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.560]  I think so.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:02.304]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:07:02.304 --> 00:07:08.307]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[00:07:08.307 --> 00:07:15.410]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.651]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:21.232]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:07:27.834 --> 00:07:31.355]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with 5 pounds and up.

[00:07:54.127 --> 00:07:59.532]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:59.532 --> 00:08:01.795]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:10.413]  Yeah.
[00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:33.912]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday.
[00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:37.474]  We got Bob Chapman on The Economic News, as I said earlier, coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:37.474 --> 00:08:40.196]  Then William Lewis, new film, just amazing.
[00:08:40.196 --> 00:08:40.976]  We're carrying it.
[00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:43.257]  I think it's the new Freedom to Fascism.
[00:08:43.257 --> 00:08:46.599]  We're carrying it at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:46.599 --> 00:08:48.660]  It is just now available.
[00:08:49.275 --> 00:08:59.183]  In fact, it's not going to be in stores for a few weeks, just like American Drug War, that I consulted on, that's been airing on Showtime, but this has three hours of extras.
[00:08:59.183 --> 00:09:05.749]  It wasn't going to be a miniseries, so really you're getting a miniseries for $24.95, the film and the miniseries.
[00:09:05.749 --> 00:09:08.271]  That's not out until May 28th.
[00:09:08.271 --> 00:09:09.532]  Guess who has it?
[00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:11.294]  No one else has it.
[00:09:11.294 --> 00:09:17.499]  I have American Drug War as part of my deal to consult on it, and I'm discounting it out of the gate.
[00:09:18.678 --> 00:09:26.079]  Because it's going to be sold for $29.95, 24.95, Infowars.com right now.
[00:09:26.079 --> 00:09:33.641]  I realize I've been lacking in plugging the books and videos we carry, and that's probably the most successful weapon we've got in the Infowar, is the truth.
[00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:36.601]  And we are a visual society.
[00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:46.003]  We are a society that watches television, watches films for our education, not reading.
[00:09:47.077 --> 00:09:50.039]  Very small percentage of people even read one book a year.
[00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:51.861]  It's less than ten percent.
[00:09:51.861 --> 00:09:54.763]  Well, these are the new books of our age.
[00:09:54.763 --> 00:10:01.869]  The new, you know, Thomas Paine screeds.
[00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:04.011]  And they need to be seen.
[00:10:04.011 --> 00:10:07.473]  The new common senses of our age.
[00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:09.695]  American Drug War, The Last White Hope.
[00:10:09.695 --> 00:10:11.377]  We have met the enemy and it is our government.
[00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:13.518]  Exposing government drug dealing, all of it.
[00:10:13.518 --> 00:10:15.440]  Now it's complete and total fraud and scam.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.845]  And how prescription drugs kill 300,000 plus a year.
[00:10:20.845 --> 00:10:26.031]  While marijuana kills no one, but they spend hundreds of billions a year, quote, fighting it.
[00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:32.679]  Because potheads make for good little slaves in the private prisons owned by the banks that launder the drug money.
[00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:34.921]  And it's all documented.
[00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:37.124]  American drug war, the last white hope.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:45.243]  Showing on Showtime, but you can get the extra three hours that were too hardcore for Showtime.
[00:10:45.243 --> 00:10:49.326]  And again, William Lewis's new film, Washington, you're fired!
[00:10:49.326 --> 00:10:58.571]  But this is kind of like the person you try to kick out, you know, the renter you try to kick out, who's got their dogs going all over the floor and putting, stacking garbage up in the garage.
[00:10:58.571 --> 00:10:59.451]  Rats everywhere.
[00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:04.814]  You know, the woman is running a brothel out of the house.
[00:11:05.936 --> 00:11:07.217]  This is a true story I'm telling.
[00:11:07.217 --> 00:11:14.720]  I've got some family that rented a rent house out in the country, and the nightmare stories they've told me about it.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:26.986]  These people, for a couple months, like three or four months, wouldn't pay their rent, and finally when they kicked them out, had the sheriff throw them out, they had, were too lazy to walk about 60 yards and put trash in the dumpster.
[00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:29.347]  So, uh, the communal dumpster in the country.
[00:11:29.347 --> 00:11:32.028]  So they, uh, just put it in the garage.
[00:11:32.028 --> 00:11:33.429]  The four-car garage.
[00:11:34.384 --> 00:11:35.245]  A large garage.
[00:11:35.245 --> 00:11:38.467]  This is a country house where they work on tractors and things.
[00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:43.070]  When my Uncle Houston lived in the house decades ago before he died.
[00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.431]  A nice little house.
[00:11:44.431 --> 00:11:52.036]  And they just stacked, I'm already digressing, just baby diapers, trash, everything to the ceiling.
[00:11:52.036 --> 00:11:54.737]  And then the whole house was filled with garbage.
[00:11:54.737 --> 00:12:00.221]  And the woman was whoring while the other guy worked as a part-time truck driver.
[00:12:01.437 --> 00:12:08.044]  Just a hellish situation and they had other scum runners before that as the country degenerates.
[00:12:08.044 --> 00:12:10.666]  But I think of that as our government.
[00:12:10.666 --> 00:12:22.278]  Just toothless scum that won't get out of our faces and takes trillions of dollars of our money over the last 50 years to propagandize us and tell us how good they are.
[00:12:22.278 --> 00:12:23.319]  It's disgusting.
[00:12:25.994 --> 00:12:38.867]  No, common sense and history knows what you are, and the people are slowly discovering the peril they're in, and then when you make your big move to take all the bank accounts and the pension funds, you're gonna fall like Ceausescu.
[00:12:38.867 --> 00:12:44.853]  But criminals never stop, and you're not gonna stop, are you?
[00:12:44.853 --> 00:12:47.876]  So go ahead and have your way with us, but in the end, you're gonna lose.
[00:12:47.876 --> 00:12:50.178]  Alright, here's the news in front of me today.
[00:12:52.072 --> 00:13:15.140]  Yesterday a caller called in from Tennessee and he said he's in Memphis and that the local papers reported that the hundreds of deputies have been federalized and are now federal police, basically, and that they just randomly ran out on the streets and had checkpoints and pulled people over and stopped people on the streets and no Fourth Amendment, just Nazi Germany.
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:15.780]  That's how it is.
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:21.142]  Just cops roving, randomly checking IDs as they do in New York, as they do in L.A., Chicago.
[00:13:22.325 --> 00:13:29.727]  And they said it was to fight terrorism, and then they arrested you if you had warrants for speeding or if you didn't have insurance.
[00:13:29.727 --> 00:13:31.787]  And they brag about it.
[00:13:31.787 --> 00:13:40.449]  And sure enough, I forgot about it until this morning, and I googled it and found a bunch of news, but didn't just find it in Tennessee, I found it all over the country.
[00:13:40.449 --> 00:13:46.931]  Now, we already knew this was happening, but the bigger issue was sheriff's deputies told him that, yeah, they're being told to get ready for martial law.
[00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:47.371]  Well, I've had
[00:13:48.744 --> 00:13:49.464]  Managers.
[00:13:49.464 --> 00:13:57.107]  One guy manages, what was it, 14 universities, 14 campuses in a university system, to be technical.
[00:13:57.107 --> 00:13:59.287]  And he said, yeah, they're training everybody for martial law.
[00:13:59.287 --> 00:14:01.528]  Had him on a few years ago.
[00:14:01.528 --> 00:14:03.169]  It's the same everywhere.
[00:14:03.169 --> 00:14:05.229]  That's the new job.
[00:14:05.229 --> 00:14:11.071]  The criminals that ship in the drugs and carry out the terror attacks own the private policing agencies and the prisons.
[00:14:11.866 --> 00:14:17.211]  And they just literally are going to own things as kingpins, like out of something out of Escape from New York.
[00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:19.092]  You know, it's the mayor.
[00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:19.693]  It's the duke.
[00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.035]  He's a number one.
[00:14:22.035 --> 00:14:26.719]  Law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terrorism initiative.
[00:14:26.719 --> 00:14:31.743]  This is out of the commercial appeal, that's the name of the paper in Memphis, the major daily paper.
[00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:39.230]  And it just shows them, it said, fighting terrorism with images of them pulling people over in their cars.
[00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.650]  See, you're the terrorist.
[00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.512]  There's no real terrorist.
[00:14:43.512 --> 00:14:50.295]  Overnight, they flipped it from, quote, brown-skinned men in caves with turbans and beards to blonde-haired, blue-eyed al-Qaeda.
[00:14:50.295 --> 00:14:51.936]  They're everywhere.
[00:14:51.936 --> 00:14:54.257]  You see?
[00:14:54.257 --> 00:14:56.658]  But they never flipped it in secret.
[00:14:56.658 --> 00:14:59.279]  We always had the documents where it was gun owners, Christians,
[00:15:00.077 --> 00:15:12.986]  People that make frequent references to the Constitution, those who believe Jesus Christ is returning, are all considered terrorist cult members who need to be, quote, re-educated, in the words of Janet Reno, on 60 Minutes?
[00:15:12.986 --> 00:15:15.828]  Oh, you're going to re-education camps!
[00:15:15.828 --> 00:15:18.429]  Your preacher's gonna tell you to go!
[00:15:18.429 --> 00:15:21.331]  You think I'm joking, don't you?
[00:15:21.331 --> 00:15:22.852]  Folks, this is all gonna come true!
[00:15:22.852 --> 00:15:24.894]  This is all gonna happen!
[00:15:30.117 --> 00:15:33.880]  You'll have to see it, won't you?
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.323]  So, uh, Law Enforcement Agencies joined together for Anti-Terror Initiative.
[00:15:37.323 --> 00:15:38.044]  We're gonna cover that.
[00:15:38.044 --> 00:15:42.828]  And I found several Tennessee papers reporting similar things.
[00:15:42.828 --> 00:15:48.253]  TransLink has to rein in its taser-happy cops before someone is injured or killed.
[00:15:53.130 --> 00:16:00.835]  And it admits that if you do not have a metro card, and because the people, I mean, it's like eight bucks up there to use it.
[00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:05.297]  It's like ten bucks down many areas in New York, but I looked it up, it's seven bucks in the city where this is happening.
[00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:07.338]  A lot of people don't have the money.
[00:16:07.338 --> 00:16:10.340]  And they walk up to you and they taser you as punishment.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.422]  It's called paying compliance.
[00:16:13.422 --> 00:16:22.547]  Just like the Polish guy panicking as they tasered him, they jumped on top of his head with their knees, they break his neck right there on the tape, and they hold him up and his head's lollin' all around, and
[00:16:23.106 --> 00:16:24.267]  It's like that woman they killed.
[00:16:24.267 --> 00:16:30.311]  They said she choked herself with her handcuffs that were behind her.
[00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:37.515]  Hey cops, you think you can get away with that type of evil and there aren't bigger criminals above you that aren't going to abuse you?
[00:16:37.515 --> 00:16:40.117]  They're abusing you right now.
[00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:49.543]  Now you won't care when your kid's dumbed down or has a learning disability or God forbid has autism or dies of a brain tumor from all the shots you give them and the water you feed them.
[00:16:49.543 --> 00:16:50.944]  You give them a drink.
[00:16:50.944 --> 00:16:51.945]  But you are going to care
[00:16:52.887 --> 00:17:01.909]  When they destroy your family's future, you may end up having okay checks, but everybody else in your family is going to be totally destitute, but that'll be alright.
[00:17:01.909 --> 00:17:04.870]  At Thanksgiving, everybody will kiss your butt at the table.
[00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:06.070]  That's what this is all really about.
[00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:08.811]  Getting an ego, isn't it?
[00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:10.671]  Well, don't worry.
[00:17:10.671 --> 00:17:11.152]  Don't worry.
[00:17:11.152 --> 00:17:14.672]  You always win.
[00:17:14.672 --> 00:17:15.613]  That's a trick.
[00:17:15.613 --> 00:17:16.253]  That's a lie.
[00:17:16.253 --> 00:17:16.913]  You don't really win.
[00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:21.539]  Ex-NFL player tased for pointing a cop.
[00:17:21.539 --> 00:17:24.281]  The police walked up to the car.
[00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:26.302]  You hear him say, and the news is against him.
[00:17:26.302 --> 00:17:29.224]  They're using the worst parts of it, and it's not even bad.
[00:17:29.224 --> 00:17:32.346]  And somebody's saying, come on, man, to the cop.
[00:17:32.346 --> 00:17:38.090]  So the former NFL star politely says, hey, let's handle this.
[00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.791]  He gets out of the car.
[00:17:39.791 --> 00:17:42.133]  The white officers have got shaved heads.
[00:17:42.133 --> 00:17:44.074]  They're all beefed up.
[00:17:44.074 --> 00:17:45.695]  They're big guys, but you can see them.
[00:17:45.695 --> 00:17:47.036]  They're intimidated when he gets out.
[00:17:47.831 --> 00:17:49.552]  But the guy's a gentle giant.
[00:17:49.552 --> 00:17:50.712]  He's real friendly.
[00:17:50.712 --> 00:17:53.093]  He's, listen, I forgot to carry it with me, but here's who I am.
[00:17:53.093 --> 00:18:00.557]  And they start putting their hands on him and they're saying, settle down.
[00:18:00.557 --> 00:18:02.317]  And he supplicates.
[00:18:02.317 --> 00:18:05.859]  He puts his hands together in the universal submission.
[00:18:05.859 --> 00:18:07.580]  He says, come on, man, please.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.641]  Everything's all right.
[00:18:10.641 --> 00:18:14.863]  And the cops charge him and run their arms into him.
[00:18:16.253 --> 00:18:20.715]  Uh, and he starts backing up, going, please don't, and they got tasers out.
[00:18:20.715 --> 00:18:26.957]  He turns to run and they taser him, and there's a wicked celebration on the news.
[00:18:26.957 --> 00:18:32.399]  There's a wicked celebration on the news, uh, about how, oh, listen to him cuss.
[00:18:32.399 --> 00:18:35.240]  Then he starts cussing after they've tasered him.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.422]  He ran from police assaulting him and tasering him.
[00:18:44.352 --> 00:18:47.253]  And look, we got clips of them tasering blind people.
[00:18:47.253 --> 00:18:54.097]  We got clips of them throwing people out of wheelchairs who were completely paralyzed from the neck down and laughing.
[00:18:54.097 --> 00:18:56.758]  We got footage of them tasering 95-year-old women.
[00:18:56.758 --> 00:19:00.620]  We got stuff of a guy in a library without an ID, and he says, I don't have an ID.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.940]  And they say, produce one.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.781]  And he goes, look, I'm leaving.
[00:19:02.781 --> 00:19:04.242]  And they go, no, I'm going to tase you.
[00:19:04.242 --> 00:19:04.902]  And they tase him.
[00:19:04.902 --> 00:19:09.204]  And the school says, yes, we tase you for not answering questions.
[00:19:09.204 --> 00:19:10.825]  It's torture.
[00:19:10.825 --> 00:19:12.365]  And people die every day.
[00:19:12.365 --> 00:19:13.626]  I see someone dying from it.
[00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:30.180]  And I told you ten years ago when these came out, because I read Pentagon documents, Colonel Alexander and others, where they say that they're going to train everybody with the images of police shooting and it habitualizes shooting, they're going to move on just to guns.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.701]  They're just going to blow you away.
[00:19:31.701 --> 00:19:34.343]  Because it's martial law.
[00:19:34.343 --> 00:19:35.224]  It's New Orleans.
[00:19:35.224 --> 00:19:40.228]  We're going to come back and cover it all, ladies and gentlemen, and the collapsing economy.
[00:19:40.228 --> 00:19:42.050]  The full rape is beginning.
[00:19:43.848 --> 00:19:48.084]  Baby baby I'm gonna leave you
[00:19:55.546 --> 00:19:58.228]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:58.228 --> 00:20:07.693]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:07.693 --> 00:20:14.798]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:15.518 --> 00:20:21.505]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.505 --> 00:20:32.277]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:33.058 --> 00:20:33.479]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:33.479 --> 00:20:34.439]  A new world order.
[00:20:34.439 --> 00:20:35.781]  In the near future.
[00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:03.904]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:03.904 --> 00:21:06.746]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:06.746 --> 00:21:09.528]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:09.528 --> 00:21:12.710]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:20.035]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:23.052 --> 00:21:28.496]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:31.818]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:31.818 --> 00:21:34.940]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.101]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:36.101 --> 00:21:36.901]  They're not after money.
[00:21:36.901 --> 00:21:38.182]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:38.182 --> 00:21:39.163]  They're after power.
[00:21:39.163 --> 00:21:40.304]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:21:51.831 --> 00:21:52.892]  You have been warned.
[00:21:53.833 --> 00:21:58.917]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:02.820]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:12.508]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[00:22:12.508 --> 00:22:16.891]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.

[00:22:20.734 --> 00:22:31.022]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness, but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable, life-threatening diseases.
[00:22:31.022 --> 00:22:36.146]  Juicing with the Champion Juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:38.828]  Put the Champion Juicer to work for you and your family.

[00:23:06.729 --> 00:23:17.791]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[00:23:21.212 --> 00:23:22.953]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.

[00:23:44.727 --> 00:23:47.352]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[00:23:47.352 --> 00:23:52.681]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:24:07.409 --> 00:24:13.495]  Remember, the illegal aliens get free health care, they're allowed a DWI drive, they don't have to have a driver's license, nothing.
[00:24:13.495 --> 00:24:14.997]  It's all just accepted.
[00:24:14.997 --> 00:24:18.460]  That's been admitted.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.323]  But citizens get the book thrown at them.
[00:24:21.323 --> 00:24:24.566]  It's like you only see police in the wealthy areas writing everybody tickets.
[00:24:26.807 --> 00:24:28.788]  Everything's selectively enforced.
[00:24:28.788 --> 00:24:31.910]  Foreign drug dealers are allowed to invest money in the stock market.
[00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.971]  There's a special federal law for it.
[00:24:33.971 --> 00:24:35.211]  It's totally lawless.
[00:24:35.211 --> 00:24:46.817]  Now, former NFL football player Timothy Worley was tasered by Georgia police for becoming confrontational, is their quote, at a traffic stop, according to news reports.
[00:24:46.817 --> 00:24:53.821]  But the video shows the extent of Worley's aggression as merely pointing at the cop and raising his voice.
[00:24:55.282 --> 00:25:02.784]  And the cop, it's weird, rushes up and pushes on him while he's saying please, man, with his hands together.
[00:25:02.784 --> 00:25:04.525]  It's really bizarre.
[00:25:04.525 --> 00:25:07.046]  And it's because the cops are intimidated and there's a bunch of them.
[00:25:07.046 --> 00:25:08.826]  They wanted to kill him.
[00:25:08.826 --> 00:25:09.886]  I mean, that's the instinct.
[00:25:09.886 --> 00:25:10.927]  They got a big bear.
[00:25:10.927 --> 00:25:12.887]  They are in a predator mode.
[00:25:12.887 --> 00:25:16.769]  They feed on us as the predator class, and that's the psychology.
[00:25:16.769 --> 00:25:17.569]  And they were scared.
[00:25:17.569 --> 00:25:22.950]  When this big guy gets out of his car, they're afraid, and they had to be the tough guys.
[00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.871]  This was like a trophy for them.
[00:25:26.189 --> 00:25:30.591]  And the black guy's putting his hands together, he's saying, please, please, come on.
[00:25:30.591 --> 00:25:34.532]  And they're saying, don't get agitated, and he's like, I'm not.
[00:25:34.532 --> 00:25:36.133]  Everything's alright.
[00:25:36.133 --> 00:25:37.793]  And so, that's not enough.
[00:25:37.793 --> 00:25:45.436]  The cops, because they were afraid, it made them mad at him, because it's all about the macho pipe dream they're a part of.
[00:25:45.436 --> 00:25:47.457]  They run in and push on him.
[00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:50.687]  And then he goes, whoa, man, whoa!
[00:25:50.687 --> 00:25:57.391]  And then he points his finger, and the guy pulls a taser out and he turns to run, and they taser him, and they have a celebration on the news.
[00:25:57.391 --> 00:25:58.632]  Let's go ahead and play the audio of this.
[00:25:58.632 --> 00:26:02.334]  The video's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:02.334 --> 00:26:11.479]  Former NFL running back and star UGA athlete is under arrest tonight, tasered by Smyrna police after becoming confrontational at a traffic stop.
[00:26:11.479 --> 00:26:13.801]  The entire incident caught on camera.
[00:26:14.431 --> 00:26:18.693]  Pittsburgh Steelers running back Tim Worley pulled over for speeding in a lane violation.
[00:26:18.693 --> 00:26:22.956]  He told the officer he had no ID.
[00:26:22.956 --> 00:26:26.718]  Worley's passengers intervening, prompting the officer to ask Worley to get out.
[00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:28.899]  Stop right there!
[00:26:28.899 --> 00:26:31.100]  I don't have any ID, sir.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.582]  Listen to him, I don't have any ID, sir.
[00:26:34.582 --> 00:26:39.364]  And I looked up this guy's bio, he's not a gangbanger type, nice guy, good record.
[00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:41.065]  Doesn't matter, get out of the car.
[00:26:41.065 --> 00:26:43.927]  And now, he just starts being nice, he's like, there's no problem.
[00:26:44.642 --> 00:26:46.904]  And these guys are heheheheheheh.
[00:26:46.904 --> 00:26:48.385]  No doubt it was because he was black, folks.
[00:26:48.385 --> 00:26:49.266]  Here we go.
[00:26:49.266 --> 00:26:53.008]  Messengers intervening, prompting the officer to ask Whirley to get out.
[00:26:53.008 --> 00:26:55.751]  But it was his gestures that sparked the confrontation.
[00:26:55.751 --> 00:27:04.157]  Whirley then loses his cool.
[00:27:04.157 --> 00:27:06.159]  Stop right there.
[00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:09.001]  Now you watch the video.
[00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:11.723]  And the cops are sitting there, you know, in his face.
[00:27:12.978 --> 00:27:16.501]  And he's just got his hands making gestures right in front of him.
[00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:18.823]  He's not waving them out of his sides.
[00:27:18.823 --> 00:27:25.169]  I mean, it's classic body language of supplicating, of bootlicking, as Paul Watson points out.
[00:27:25.169 --> 00:27:26.730]  And that's not enough.
[00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:31.274]  He starts praying to him, and the cop just rushes him.
[00:27:31.274 --> 00:27:35.138]  And that's aggressive, putting your hand and saying, please, sir, be reasonable.
[00:27:35.138 --> 00:27:36.599]  Cop didn't like hearing that.
[00:27:36.599 --> 00:27:38.301]  Didn't like you talking back to him, boy!
[00:27:39.835 --> 00:27:41.696]  Don't you pray to him!
[00:27:41.696 --> 00:27:45.257]  He is your God, but he doesn't like how you just prayed, boy!
[00:27:45.257 --> 00:28:03.944]  So now we're gonna taser you with 50,000 volts and torture you, and then have the news media lie about you, and the cowardly public so brainwashed and brain-dead and brain-damaged from the chemical warfare attacks they're under, that, I'm serious, slaves, you don't know what you're under, that they'll watch this video and not even see what the video shows, they'll just believe the news.
[00:28:05.569 --> 00:28:08.591]  Now, he's begging, because the cops are threatening him.
[00:28:08.591 --> 00:28:11.293]  You make one more gesture at me, boy!
[00:28:11.293 --> 00:28:12.633]  And he's like, I'm not.
[00:28:12.633 --> 00:28:13.654]  Please, sir.
[00:28:13.654 --> 00:28:14.755]  Everything's okay.
[00:28:14.755 --> 00:28:16.696]  Oh, you don't pray to me.
[00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:18.897]  That's not the proper way to pray to God.
[00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:28.383]  And so the cop runs in, pushes him in the chest, and the cop goes... Then the NFL player goes, whoa, man!
[00:28:30.197 --> 00:28:39.644]  And then they pull out the taser, and he turns to run, and they have the victory against America, the victory against freedom, the victory against honor, the victory against decency.
[00:28:39.644 --> 00:28:41.906]  Goodness, and America loses again.
[00:28:41.906 --> 00:28:42.887]  Play the tape.
[00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:45.349]  Dude, don't be that way, man.
[00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:47.310]  Worley then loses his cool.
[00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.212]  You know what?
[00:28:49.212 --> 00:28:49.692]  You know what?
[00:28:49.692 --> 00:28:51.514]  You go ahead and do what you gotta do, man.
[00:28:51.514 --> 00:28:53.475]  And watch what happens next.
[00:28:53.475 --> 00:28:57.618]  No, you're not gonna play me with that.
[00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:03.962]  The officer tases Worley, sending him to the ground.
[00:29:03.962 --> 00:29:06.644]  Stop right there.
[00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:10.928]  They don't even say in the newscast that the cop assaults him.
[00:29:10.928 --> 00:29:14.211]  He's praying to him, going, come on, let's be reasonable.
[00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:16.794]  And so the cop runs up and pushes his hands into him.
[00:29:18.582 --> 00:29:21.625]  Everybody's got to have cameras mounted on your cars, everything.
[00:29:21.625 --> 00:29:25.268]  And when they start doing this, you just got to lay down and put your hands behind your head.
[00:29:25.268 --> 00:29:27.970]  And I know, because if not, they're going to set you up.
[00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.272]  Now, the guy did do that in California University.
[00:29:31.272 --> 00:29:32.714]  They still tasered him.
[00:29:32.714 --> 00:29:37.337]  But it still, then they couldn't charge him with the assault charge.
[00:29:37.337 --> 00:29:38.518]  We'll come back.
[00:29:38.518 --> 00:29:41.721]  And look, I know all police aren't like this, but the bad ones are protected.
[00:29:41.721 --> 00:29:42.982]  The media backs you up.
[00:29:42.982 --> 00:29:44.043]  The system likes this.
[00:29:44.881 --> 00:29:48.813]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.813 --> 00:29:51.502]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.847 --> 00:29:58.350]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:03.775]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:30:03.775 --> 00:30:08.920]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:20.050]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:26.212]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:30:26.212 --> 00:30:32.473]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:30:32.473 --> 00:30:33.513]  What about you?
[00:30:33.513 --> 00:30:38.155]  Order your KDF shower filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[00:30:54.298 --> 00:30:54.758]  Fact.
[00:30:54.758 --> 00:31:00.762]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:31:00.762 --> 00:31:05.104]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:31:05.104 --> 00:31:12.788]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:13.529]  The solution.
[00:31:13.529 --> 00:31:17.491]  Detoxification integrated with Electrochi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:26.837]  The LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[00:31:26.837 --> 00:31:34.982]  Detoxification works with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.
[00:31:34.982 --> 00:31:38.725]  For mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system.
[00:31:38.945 --> 00:31:39.566]  We're good.
[00:31:54.306 --> 00:31:56.129]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[00:31:56.129 --> 00:32:02.117]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.

[00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:18.436]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs, two books that combine to over a thousand pages and other information.

[00:32:26.002 --> 00:32:30.225]  The last word monastery spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[00:32:30.225 --> 00:32:30.705]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.

[00:32:34.087 --> 00:32:38.130]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.330]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:33:03.123 --> 00:33:10.587]  If it sounds like I hate the police, that's because it's true.
[00:33:10.587 --> 00:33:12.748]  I hate the system.
[00:33:12.748 --> 00:33:30.398]  I hate this corrupt system that has slowly twisted and turned our police from tough guys who were well-respected and pretty much liked, but that still had some corruption and problems, who literally had people bringing them coffee and pieces of pie and who were trusted, to people that are now hated.
[00:33:33.322 --> 00:33:34.423]  That's what the system wants.
[00:33:34.423 --> 00:33:35.664]  They want you to act bad.
[00:33:35.664 --> 00:33:37.766]  They want everyone to know.
[00:33:37.766 --> 00:33:45.833]  So that then it's the people against the police and then they further compact into a gang psychosis, gang psychology.
[00:33:45.833 --> 00:33:49.116]  Behavioral psychologists are manipulating you.
[00:33:49.116 --> 00:33:54.240]  That's why they won't hire police with over 100 IQs in any major department in the United States.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.482]  And please don't email me saying that's not true.
[00:33:56.482 --> 00:34:00.406]  If you just Google that, there's hundreds of mainstream news articles and lawsuits over it.
[00:34:01.303 --> 00:34:03.665]  Why won't they hire someone over 100 IQ?
[00:34:03.665 --> 00:34:12.833]  It's come out in Maryland and in Baltimore, it's come out in Houston, because they found that you will not break the law, you will not violate the Constitution.
[00:34:12.833 --> 00:34:19.979]  Someone of above average IQ, above average intelligence, is dangerous to a tyranny.
[00:34:19.979 --> 00:34:23.482]  That's why many departments now hire felons, just like the military does.
[00:34:23.482 --> 00:34:24.382]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[00:34:24.382 --> 00:34:24.903]  Google that.
[00:34:26.258 --> 00:34:28.399]  We are shifting into a very dangerous time.
[00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:32.599]  These guys are coming back by the hundreds of thousands every year from Iraq.
[00:34:32.599 --> 00:34:35.440]  They've been running real checkpoints, real door-to-door.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.880]  They're in combat mode.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.501]  Most of them have PTSD.
[00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:41.581]  And they're looking for a fight.
[00:34:41.581 --> 00:34:45.222]  And man, they pull over, this NFL running back, and this guy gets out.
[00:34:45.222 --> 00:34:50.823]  His body language, he keeps his hands in close to his chest in a pleading.
[00:34:50.823 --> 00:34:52.044]  He's being reasonable.
[00:34:52.044 --> 00:34:53.244]  And then the cop pushes him!
[00:34:54.542 --> 00:34:56.463]  He has his hands going, please sir.
[00:34:56.463 --> 00:35:02.425]  And the cop calls that putting his fist together and shoves him.
[00:35:02.425 --> 00:35:04.705]  And then he cusses at him.
[00:35:04.705 --> 00:35:07.486]  And says, man, what is your problem?
[00:35:07.486 --> 00:35:10.147]  And then he sees the taser and the guy tries to run!
[00:35:10.147 --> 00:35:12.828]  He tries to run from physical assault!
[00:35:12.828 --> 00:35:15.909]  It's not enough you get to push him around, get to be a big man!
[00:35:16.932 --> 00:35:22.274]  Yeah, I'd like to see you go start a fight with that, uh, big black guy, you know, just out in the field somewhere.
[00:35:22.274 --> 00:35:27.636]  Why don't you call him up, if he's such a big man, and say, hey, come on, let's go have a fight out in the field with just our fist.
[00:35:27.636 --> 00:35:28.556]  No!
[00:35:28.556 --> 00:35:32.538]  You had to prove you were a big game hunter, hunting man.
[00:35:32.538 --> 00:35:33.918]  You're real big and bad.
[00:35:33.918 --> 00:35:36.579]  Now, when the black guy gets out, they're scared.
[00:35:36.579 --> 00:35:43.242]  Because there's al-Qaeda's everywhere, and they teach the cops to be afraid, and... Cops didn't used to be like that in the past.
[00:35:45.475 --> 00:35:46.656]  I remember famous cases.
[00:35:46.656 --> 00:35:50.939]  You'd have somebody up in a bell tower shooting people or somebody in a school holding hostages.
[00:35:50.939 --> 00:35:52.940]  First cops on the scenes.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.401]  They'd be wearing short-sleeved shirts and slacks.
[00:35:55.401 --> 00:35:56.842]  They'd go in there with a revolver.
[00:35:56.842 --> 00:36:01.345]  They'd go in and they'd kill the son of a bitch every single time.
[00:36:01.345 --> 00:36:02.306]  You couldn't stop them.
[00:36:03.692 --> 00:36:05.253]  Because they were real men.
[00:36:05.253 --> 00:36:26.003]  They weren't these fake cops who just shake with fear and have been taught all these procedures, where they wait 4 hours and 15 minutes at Columbine, 3 hours and 40-something minutes in Virginia, while the feds arrive, and you see cops waddling around, putting body armor on, 3 hours into the event, while somebody's in there shooting everybody out of their way.
[00:36:33.171 --> 00:36:36.372]  You couldn't stop police in the past.
[00:36:36.372 --> 00:36:39.312]  And there weren't very many cops, but if a car got stolen, they investigated.
[00:36:39.312 --> 00:36:42.753]  If your house got robbed, they investigated.
[00:36:42.753 --> 00:36:44.654]  That was a shooter.
[00:36:44.654 --> 00:36:46.434]  Of course, the citizens were different, too.
[00:36:46.434 --> 00:36:53.816]  Citizens would charge in and kill somebody in minutes who was in a school, or in a church, or in a business.
[00:36:53.816 --> 00:37:02.698]  And the police trusted the people, and the people trusted the police, and everybody drove around with guns in their gun racks, even in New York and Illinois, just 30 years ago.
[00:37:03.655 --> 00:37:05.416]  Just ten years ago in Texas.
[00:37:05.416 --> 00:37:12.880]  But then TV and the culture and the social messages taught everybody that we were each other's enemies.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.802]  And that you can't trust the citizens and you can't trust the police.
[00:37:16.802 --> 00:37:21.444]  And the incredible part about this is this cop shoves this guy for pleading.
[00:37:23.826 --> 00:37:24.686]  He's talking to the cop.
[00:37:24.686 --> 00:37:26.266]  The cops are all agitated.
[00:37:26.266 --> 00:37:28.047]  And then they've edited out what the cops are yelling.
[00:37:28.047 --> 00:37:29.207]  But you can hear the end of them yelling.
[00:37:29.207 --> 00:37:30.607]  You can see the tape being cut.
[00:37:30.607 --> 00:37:32.248]  You know, they're cutting out the cops.
[00:37:32.248 --> 00:37:35.288]  It just keeps cutting back to him going, the cops are all bowed up around him.
[00:37:35.288 --> 00:37:36.568]  I want to see the unedited tape.
[00:37:36.568 --> 00:37:37.429]  You know it's going to come out.
[00:37:37.429 --> 00:37:38.929]  His lawyers are going to get it.
[00:37:38.929 --> 00:37:42.250]  Or maybe sometimes the cops just erase the original to cover it up.
[00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.150]  But still, you can see they've edited it.
[00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:47.311]  But even with the edits, he's going, come on, man!
[00:37:47.311 --> 00:37:47.871]  He's pleading.
[00:37:47.871 --> 00:37:49.271]  And then they cut, cut, cut.
[00:37:49.918 --> 00:37:54.040]  And he says, you make your fist one more time, and he goes, please, please.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.941]  And man, the cop doesn't like him begging him.
[00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:01.603]  He puts his hands together, praise to him.
[00:38:01.603 --> 00:38:07.406]  I mean, the symbol of supplication, of bowing down.
[00:38:07.406 --> 00:38:09.287]  He even leans forward and nods his head.
[00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:10.147]  Please, sir.
[00:38:10.147 --> 00:38:11.127]  Please, boss.
[00:38:11.127 --> 00:38:12.448]  Please, master.
[00:38:12.448 --> 00:38:14.369]  Please, please.
[00:38:14.369 --> 00:38:16.570]  That's not enough.
[00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:19.331]  And I found with police, when you submit, that's when they go wild.
[00:38:21.346 --> 00:38:23.607]  If you childishly beg them, they freak out.
[00:38:23.607 --> 00:38:26.828]  I've said it's like the same training they give us, they've gone through.
[00:38:26.828 --> 00:38:27.848]  It's like dog training.
[00:38:27.848 --> 00:38:33.270]  You talk very firmly and very slowly.
[00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:35.350]  Do not violate my rights.
[00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.771]  You are in the wrong.
[00:38:38.771 --> 00:38:43.833]  But actually, when he says to them, do what you gotta do, that's exactly what I said when I was at the Willie Nelson concert.
[00:38:49.286 --> 00:38:50.847]  That's exactly what I said.
[00:38:50.847 --> 00:38:53.489]  There's literally thousands of cameras.
[00:38:53.489 --> 00:38:53.889]  Thousands.
[00:38:53.889 --> 00:38:55.531]  They're just everywhere flashing.
[00:38:55.531 --> 00:38:59.233]  We've got still cameras taking pictures.
[00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:04.237]  And, uh... I'm there.
[00:39:04.237 --> 00:39:10.001]  And I'm sitting up there, and I'm walking back and forth getting people drinks, you know, because I invited guests there.
[00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:15.025]  So I'm going down and getting people drinks, bringing them back up.
[00:39:15.025 --> 00:39:15.145]  And...
[00:39:16.019 --> 00:39:16.799]  Security stops me.
[00:39:16.799 --> 00:39:18.120]  They go, you're Alex Jones, aren't you?
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.640]  Hey, you like the show.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.001]  Where were you sitting?
[00:39:21.001 --> 00:39:22.761]  And I notice I came back and they were all kind of looking at me.
[00:39:22.761 --> 00:39:27.022]  And then 30 minutes later I go to get some, you know, the kids some food.
[00:39:27.022 --> 00:39:30.703]  And I come back and my son had the little camera taking pictures.
[00:39:30.703 --> 00:39:32.024]  He loves to take pictures with a digital camera.
[00:39:32.024 --> 00:39:34.004]  It's not like 35 millimeter where it's a waste.
[00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:36.185]  He can just take picture after picture.
[00:39:36.185 --> 00:39:38.626]  And there's this woman yelling at my dad and other people.
[00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:40.486]  And she's sitting, she's got security guards with her.
[00:39:40.486 --> 00:39:41.247]  And I said, it's okay.
[00:39:41.247 --> 00:39:43.147]  They're like, no, we have to take that camera.
[00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:44.908]  And I said, but there's cameras all over.
[00:39:44.908 --> 00:39:45.548]  See them flashing?
[00:39:47.006 --> 00:39:49.908]  And they just said, literally, they're just flashing everywhere.
[00:39:49.908 --> 00:39:51.350]  And they just said, well, we're taking it.
[00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:54.953]  And I said, well, no, that's not reasonable.
[00:39:54.953 --> 00:39:55.953]  Go get your supervisor.
[00:39:55.953 --> 00:39:59.536]  And then they come back and they're all sitting there freaking out on me.
[00:39:59.536 --> 00:40:04.761]  And I just said, look, I said, do what you got to do, but I promise you, I'm going to sue you individually.
[00:40:04.761 --> 00:40:05.801]  You do this to my family.
[00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:07.363]  This is selective enforcement.
[00:40:07.363 --> 00:40:08.664]  This woman knows who I am.
[00:40:08.664 --> 00:40:09.965]  And she's like, you bet I do.
[00:40:12.056 --> 00:40:14.657]  They were freaking out, they were gonna get Alex Jones!
[00:40:14.657 --> 00:40:16.878]  See, everything's about selective enforcement.
[00:40:16.878 --> 00:40:19.019]  There were no signs saying no photography.
[00:40:19.019 --> 00:40:20.840]  Everybody was taking pictures.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.321]  But it was about them winning, them showing me.
[00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:30.623]  But I calmly just said, do what you gotta do, but I promise you, you can beat the rap, but you're not gonna beat the ride.
[00:40:30.623 --> 00:40:33.244]  And I said, you know this is selective enforcement.
[00:40:33.244 --> 00:40:37.786]  And the head DPS guy just said, yeah, you're right, just don't take any more pictures, come on.
[00:40:37.786 --> 00:40:40.227]  That woman got so mad, went down the hall griping at him.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:45.163]  And, uh, I saw my dad about to take pictures again and I said, do not do it.
[00:40:45.163 --> 00:40:47.344]  He goes, but everybody is taking pictures.
[00:40:47.344 --> 00:40:49.626]  People in this very, very group of bleachers.
[00:40:49.626 --> 00:40:51.107]  And I said, it doesn't matter, dad.
[00:40:51.107 --> 00:40:52.808]  They want to get us.
[00:40:52.808 --> 00:40:53.869]  You understand?
[00:40:53.869 --> 00:40:57.272]  Don't take pictures.
[00:40:57.272 --> 00:41:00.714]  Because that woman was just standing there watching the whole time.
[00:41:00.714 --> 00:41:04.317]  She was going to show Alex Jones, the American Al Qaeda.
[00:41:04.317 --> 00:41:05.858]  She watches Fox News.
[00:41:05.858 --> 00:41:06.698]  I need to be tasered.
[00:41:06.698 --> 00:41:07.499]  I need to be arrested.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:21.015]  So I don't hate you police, but when I see you wrong someone like this guy that groveled to you... And this is what the tape edited.
[00:41:21.015 --> 00:41:24.800]  Who knows what's really on the tape?
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.243]  Play the audio straight through without me interrupting it.
[00:41:29.025 --> 00:41:38.172]  Former NFL running back and star UGA athlete is under arrest tonight, tasered by Smyrna police after becoming confrontational at a traffic stop.
[00:41:38.172 --> 00:41:40.514]  The entire incident caught on camera.
[00:41:41.121 --> 00:41:45.405]  Pittsburgh Steelers running back Tim Worley pulled over for speeding in a lane violation.
[00:41:45.405 --> 00:41:49.628]  He told the officer he had no ID.
[00:41:49.628 --> 00:41:53.912]  Worley's passengers intervening, prompting the officer to ask Worley to get out.
[00:41:53.912 --> 00:42:03.461]  But it was his gestures that sparked the confrontation.
[00:42:03.461 --> 00:42:04.902]  Worley then loses his cool.
[00:42:07.302 --> 00:42:07.782]  You know what?
[00:42:07.782 --> 00:42:09.603]  You go ahead and do what you gotta do, man.
[00:42:09.603 --> 00:42:19.427]  And watch what happens next.
[00:42:19.427 --> 00:42:25.769]  The officer tases Worley, sending him to the ground.
[00:42:25.769 --> 00:42:28.851]  The confrontation escalates as backup arrives.
[00:42:28.851 --> 00:42:31.192]  Worley stringing one profanity after another.
[00:42:31.192 --> 00:42:32.872]  Stop right there!
[00:42:32.872 --> 00:42:34.493]  The confrontation escalates.
[00:42:35.367 --> 00:42:47.752]  Next time you get mugged, somebody mugs your grandmother who's 85 years old and beats her head in, expect the cops, according to this logic, to come and say, oh, she was in a confrontation, she escalated.
[00:42:47.752 --> 00:42:56.336]  They're assaulting him, they're multiple times tasing him, and he's on the ground cussing at them.
[00:42:56.336 --> 00:42:59.397]  And they imply he deserves it because he's cussing.
[00:43:00.519 --> 00:43:02.702]  Oh, you won't give a urine sample when you're in the hospital.
[00:43:02.702 --> 00:43:03.903]  They tase you.
[00:43:03.903 --> 00:43:06.907]  Oh, you didn't pay for your fare on the bus or the train.
[00:43:06.907 --> 00:43:08.709]  We're going to tase you.
[00:43:08.709 --> 00:43:11.372]  Oh, you're protesting and you won't get up off the sidewalk.
[00:43:11.372 --> 00:43:13.575]  We're going to tase you or break your arm until you get up.
[00:43:13.575 --> 00:43:15.938]  I have videos of this.
[00:43:15.938 --> 00:43:17.900]  Torture is illegal in this country.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.302]  They do it all the time.
[00:43:20.805 --> 00:43:28.229]  And I had Austin cops come up to me a few months ago, and I was protesting Rick Perry for going to Bilderberg Group, violating federal law, and they just came up and said, we're gonna arrest you if you don't leave.
[00:43:28.229 --> 00:43:32.111]  And I said, go ahead, First Amendment, you lose suits all the time.
[00:43:32.111 --> 00:43:38.614]  They had the riot cops suiting up, and, uh, getting their tasers out, and I had to preach to the cops.
[00:43:38.614 --> 00:43:43.557]  I had to go, you're all getting sued, every commander here, you're gonna beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:50.325]  And the cops started arguing, saying, you know, I could hear them arguing.
[00:43:50.325 --> 00:43:53.625]  They were arguing with each other.
[00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:59.906]  And then at a high level, a captain shows up and comes over to me and... It's all on YouTube.
[00:43:59.906 --> 00:44:03.047]  I mean, it's just disgusting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:03.047 --> 00:44:05.968]  Trying to cheat me out of my First Amendment.
[00:44:05.968 --> 00:44:07.648]  That's the big one!
[00:44:07.648 --> 00:44:08.848]  The Bill of Rights!
[00:44:08.848 --> 00:44:10.088]  That's what the whole country's founded on!
[00:44:10.088 --> 00:44:11.849]  Those are the big laws!
[00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:12.709]  You're breaking them!
[00:44:12.709 --> 00:44:14.009]  That's called being a tyrant!
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:20.964]  Threatening me with false arrest if I don't?
[00:44:20.964 --> 00:44:23.846]  And thank God, Austin's lost scores of lawsuits.
[00:44:23.846 --> 00:44:26.848]  They just lost one last month.
[00:44:26.848 --> 00:44:32.332]  They were arresting anti-war people for standing with signs on street corners, and they lost a suit again.
[00:44:32.332 --> 00:44:35.255]  Our money!
[00:44:35.255 --> 00:44:36.796]  Stop violating us!
[00:44:36.796 --> 00:44:39.638]  But the bigger issue here is the sickening media.
[00:44:43.058 --> 00:44:48.522]  Play that, play the end part, where they talk about, oh the confrontation got worse.
[00:44:48.522 --> 00:44:53.025]  The cops push him.
[00:44:53.025 --> 00:44:55.626]  He's begging.
[00:44:55.626 --> 00:45:01.991]  The officer tases Worley, sending him to the ground.
[00:45:01.991 --> 00:45:05.073]  The confrontation escalates as backup arrives.
[00:45:05.073 --> 00:45:09.856]  Worley, stringing one profanity after another, is arrested and taken into custody.
[00:45:11.983 --> 00:45:17.208]  Yes, um, what do you do when your finger gets slammed by a hammer when you're driving nails?
[00:45:17.208 --> 00:45:21.271]  What do you do when you cut yourself cutting tomatoes?
[00:45:21.271 --> 00:45:24.454]  Well, how about 50,000 volts repeatedly pumped into you?
[00:45:24.454 --> 00:45:30.099]  As he stands there on the ground with his hand out saying, please don't, and they taser him again and again and again.
[00:45:30.099 --> 00:45:35.584]  It's clear from the tape.
[00:45:35.584 --> 00:45:36.885]  A celebration of evil.
[00:45:38.288 --> 00:45:38.988]  Of winning.
[00:45:38.988 --> 00:45:40.469]  Ooh, you're winning.
[00:45:40.469 --> 00:45:40.949]  Well, you know what?
[00:45:40.949 --> 00:45:42.730]  He still goes home to his millions.
[00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.310]  He still goes home to his family.
[00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:46.991]  He was smart enough not to touch you even when you assaulted him.
[00:45:46.991 --> 00:45:50.532]  And he'll beat you in court.
[00:45:50.532 --> 00:45:51.753]  And he's the better man.
[00:45:51.753 --> 00:45:53.333]  And I know you hate that.
[00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:55.074]  I know that upsets you.
[00:45:55.074 --> 00:45:58.275]  That he's got more money than you.
[00:45:58.275 --> 00:45:58.655]  All of it.
[00:46:01.181 --> 00:46:03.522]  Because the cops doing this are thugs.
[00:46:03.522 --> 00:46:04.963]  They're shames to this country.
[00:46:04.963 --> 00:46:09.985]  And what's even more shameful is that the media would defend it.
[00:46:09.985 --> 00:46:12.165]  That the media would say it was okay.
[00:46:12.165 --> 00:46:16.907]  I want everybody to get this story from PrisonPlanet.com out to everyone they know.
[00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:22.189]  Ex-NFL player tasered for pointing at cop.
[00:46:22.189 --> 00:46:23.530]  You gotta go watch this video.
[00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:26.091]  They shove him.
[00:46:26.091 --> 00:46:30.193]  He's going, please.
[00:46:30.193 --> 00:46:30.613]  Please.
[00:46:32.105 --> 00:46:33.286]  And see, it's the cops' order.
[00:46:33.286 --> 00:46:35.307]  That's the God Complex.
[00:46:35.307 --> 00:46:39.469]  I told you not to do something with your hands.
[00:46:39.469 --> 00:46:40.329]  You didn't follow my order.
[00:46:40.329 --> 00:46:42.250]  I get to shove you now.
[00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:45.051]  And there's cops right behind me with guns.
[00:46:45.051 --> 00:46:45.972]  That's the whole plan.
[00:46:45.972 --> 00:46:49.273]  We can trick you into fighting back like a man.
[00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:54.516]  You better lay there like a wimp to me, or I'm gonna kill you.
[00:46:54.516 --> 00:46:55.956]  Ex-NFL player.
[00:46:55.956 --> 00:46:58.978]  And see, when it's black cops in LA, they can do this to white guys.
[00:46:59.855 --> 00:47:00.696]  That's how this works.
[00:47:00.696 --> 00:47:02.318]  It only makes the world worse and worse.
[00:47:02.318 --> 00:47:05.761]  Like when I was going to the TSA.
[00:47:05.761 --> 00:47:08.464]  Big black guys.
[00:47:08.464 --> 00:47:09.726]  You know, I don't ever take my shoes off.
[00:47:09.726 --> 00:47:13.449]  I always try to go through without doing it.
[00:47:13.449 --> 00:47:16.132]  And they go, hey, take your shoes off.
[00:47:16.132 --> 00:47:18.615]  And I said, you know, I really don't like the athlete's foot that's on this ground.
[00:47:20.365 --> 00:47:33.734]  Uh, you know, this isn't really, you see, they all make you freak out about sanitary and, ooh, wipe your hands and all this to make you habitually, you know, obsessive-compulsive, but walking across where tens of thousands of people walk from every other third-world country, that's okay.
[00:47:33.734 --> 00:47:37.857]  And so I said, well, uh, you know, real nicely, well, I really don't like, uh, walking across this.
[00:47:38.888 --> 00:47:41.389]  You know, it'll infect you.
[00:47:41.389 --> 00:47:45.311]  And he said, oh, Mr. Stinky Feet doesn't like it.
[00:47:45.311 --> 00:47:47.192]  Come on over here, Mr. Stinky Feet.
[00:47:47.192 --> 00:47:48.772]  You like it, Mr. Stinky Feet?
[00:47:48.772 --> 00:47:51.573]  I'm gonna wave this wand over and they're laughing.
[00:47:51.573 --> 00:47:56.395]  He's got some stinky feet.
[00:47:56.395 --> 00:47:57.876]  And actually, I didn't hate him at that point.
[00:47:57.876 --> 00:47:58.856]  I felt sorry for him.
[00:47:58.856 --> 00:48:00.917]  I realized they're under chemical attack.
[00:48:00.917 --> 00:48:02.238]  They're under biological attack.
[00:48:02.952 --> 00:48:09.954]  They've been enslaved their whole lives for scores of generations since they came over on slave ships.
[00:48:09.954 --> 00:48:13.595]  I just felt sorry for them and the death of this country.
[00:48:13.595 --> 00:48:16.036]  And I feel sorry for those shaved head white cops too.
[00:48:16.036 --> 00:48:19.337]  They're just... They have no idea they're under eugenics attack.
[00:48:19.337 --> 00:48:21.298]  Publicly documented.
[00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:23.678]  Their kids, you know, they just laugh at me.
[00:48:23.678 --> 00:48:27.400]  Their kids sit there being brain damaged every day, brushing their teeth and drinking the water.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.200]  They're not going to stop.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.440]  And I have all the documents and made films about it.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.241]  They're not going to check into it.
[00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:32.081]  They're just going to laugh at me.
[00:48:33.985 --> 00:48:44.433]  The blacks are gonna go through all this, the whites, it doesn't matter, we're all just pathetic slaves.
[00:48:44.433 --> 00:49:00.286]  Ex-NFL player Timothy Worsley was tasered by Georgia police for becoming confrontational at a traffic stop, according to news reports, but the video shows the extent of Worsley's aggression, Worley's aggression, was merely pointing at the cop and raising his voice after being shoved.
[00:49:00.286 --> 00:49:01.387]  Paul, you might want to add that?
[00:49:03.241 --> 00:49:05.583]  See, Paul can't even write these as bad as it is.
[00:49:05.583 --> 00:49:11.646]  After Worley exits the vehicle and appears calm, the cowardly officer accuses him of making fist.
[00:49:11.646 --> 00:49:17.510]  When Worley is doing no more than crossing his arms, he's begging Paul.
[00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:25.034]  He's crossing him at first, which is a sign of submission, but a sign of defensiveness also.
[00:49:25.034 --> 00:49:27.676]  Like, I'm a turtle, in my shell, I'm being defensive.
[00:49:28.704 --> 00:49:29.584]  Knowing it's a threat.
[00:49:29.584 --> 00:49:30.585]  I mean, this guy's not stupid.
[00:49:30.585 --> 00:49:35.987]  He knows he's dealing with life and death right now with this cop.
[00:49:35.987 --> 00:49:41.750]  You gotta follow that cop around, see what meetings he goes to, who he hangs out with, what affiliations he has.
[00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:43.371]  I think you'll find something.
[00:49:43.371 --> 00:49:50.574]  Apparently, incorrect body language is now an offense that justifies pain compliance correction by means of tasering.
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:59.305]  Worley even puts his palms together in a prayer-like pose in an attempt to reassure the officer he is calm, but that is not good enough.
[00:49:59.305 --> 00:50:07.690]  After Worley points at the cop, for half a second the officer then approaches Worley, who backs away, but is then tasered.
[00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:09.511]  Well, he shoves him, yeah.
[00:50:09.511 --> 00:50:11.272]  You watch the video, he shoves him.
[00:50:11.272 --> 00:50:13.734]  Hell, you didn't take it!
[00:50:13.734 --> 00:50:15.415]  You backed away from being assaulted!
[00:50:17.071 --> 00:50:22.897]  What should Worley's correct body language have been to avoid a 50,000-volt shooting through his body?
[00:50:22.897 --> 00:50:27.743]  Should he have kneeled and licked the officer's boots while he was being lectured?
[00:50:27.743 --> 00:50:34.450]  Why are police being trained that simply talking to cops or pointing a finger is evidence of an imminent physical threat?
[00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:36.953]  With the guy screaming, you make this one more time!
[00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:48.858]  Perhaps Worley's behavior was deserving a little torture when compared to the revelation that the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority Police Service tasers passengers who dodge their fares.
[00:50:48.858 --> 00:50:49.959]  I'll be right back.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.481]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:50:56.481 --> 00:51:00.084]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:51:00.084 --> 00:51:02.546]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:51:02.546 --> 00:51:05.588]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:51:05.588 --> 00:51:11.312]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:51:11.312 --> 00:51:15.235]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:51:15.555 --> 00:51:20.758]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:52:54.616 --> 00:52:56.676]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:52:56.676 --> 00:52:59.977]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:52:59.977 --> 00:53:04.938]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:53:04.938 --> 00:53:07.839]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:53:07.839 --> 00:53:12.921]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[00:53:12.921 --> 00:53:14.661]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:53:14.881 --> 00:53:20.884]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:53:20.884 --> 00:53:23.004]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[00:53:23.004 --> 00:53:27.286]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:53:27.286 --> 00:53:31.868]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong.
[00:53:32.068 --> 00:53:38.715]  That they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:44.020]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:47.284]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.

[00:54:19.685 --> 00:54:25.108]  Everybody in the back office is freaking out watching the video of this former NFL guy.
[00:54:25.108 --> 00:54:31.091]  As the cop's screaming at him, he nicely folds his arms, supplicating.
[00:54:31.091 --> 00:54:35.393]  Folds them, kind of like, you know, from a coach screaming at him, the training to submit to it.
[00:54:35.393 --> 00:54:37.334]  Kind of kneels his head down.
[00:54:37.334 --> 00:54:39.155]  It's so sad to watch.
[00:54:39.155 --> 00:54:41.956]  And then he just screams, don't you make fist at me.
[00:54:41.956 --> 00:54:45.238]  So he undoes them and puts his hands together and says, please, please.
[00:54:46.528 --> 00:54:53.389]  And man, the cop then rushes in, shoves him, and he goes, okay, starts yelling at him, and then the tasering starts, he runs.
[00:54:53.389 --> 00:54:56.550]  I mean, what?
[00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:58.970]  It's so evil, but the news!
[00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:01.771]  You know, they taser him, and then it escalates.
[00:55:01.771 --> 00:55:07.892]  How dare him cuss as he's being tasered?
[00:55:07.892 --> 00:55:08.392]  You know, I love it.
[00:55:08.392 --> 00:55:14.553]  Whenever somebody abuses you, or somebody mugs you, I guess the new thing is, oh, you were part of it, you know, they robbed your house, you escalated it.
[00:55:15.495 --> 00:55:18.377]  You're out of town and somebody robs your house, everything you own.
[00:55:18.377 --> 00:55:21.338]  You escalated it.
[00:55:21.338 --> 00:55:25.520]  And, ladies and gentlemen, the psychology of hating the cops is not going to help us.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.962]  The New World Order wants us to hate them.
[00:55:27.962 --> 00:55:29.903]  They air this so we hate them.
[00:55:29.903 --> 00:55:34.085]  And so they can legitimize this so that we don't trust them, they don't trust us.
[00:55:34.085 --> 00:55:37.126]  Please stop it, police.
[00:55:37.126 --> 00:55:44.010]  I mean, all the videos that have come out of Austin and surrounding areas that are on the national news where they'll just have somebody in handcuffs beating them.
[00:55:45.051 --> 00:55:49.595]  Just because they want to.
[00:55:49.595 --> 00:55:55.980]  And they'll just punch you and punch you and punch you or shoot you in the back and then the media says it's good.
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:56:04.287]  Folks, then I've got even worse news.
[00:56:04.287 --> 00:56:05.588]  I've got even worse news.
[00:56:05.588 --> 00:56:07.250]  Google this.
[00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:09.672]  Paul's doing an article for PrisonPlanet.com on it right now.
[00:56:11.356 --> 00:56:18.978]  I'll get Nemo to post it so you can read it and find it easier, but law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terrorism initiative.
[00:56:18.978 --> 00:56:22.939]  Now just Google that and you'll see it all over the country.
[00:56:22.939 --> 00:56:27.380]  But the latest one was a few days ago in Tennessee.
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:32.221]  Law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terror initiative.
[00:56:32.221 --> 00:56:33.881]  Now we've got terrorism everywhere, right?
[00:56:33.881 --> 00:56:34.681]  And so what do they do?
[00:56:34.681 --> 00:56:38.302]  They run checkpoints, randomly search people on the streets, randomly search
[00:56:39.602 --> 00:56:43.183]  The rivers randomly... I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:56:43.183 --> 00:56:46.104]  I mean, if you want to find gold, go where the gold's at.
[00:56:46.104 --> 00:56:49.545]  Or you want to find... liquor.
[00:56:49.545 --> 00:56:51.405]  Let's say you wanted some whiskey.
[00:56:51.405 --> 00:56:53.126]  You drive into town and go to the liquor store.
[00:56:53.126 --> 00:56:56.727]  You wouldn't go to a creek bottom and say, I want some liquor.
[00:56:56.727 --> 00:57:00.728]  Let me just randomly drive to a creek bottom and go down to a creek bottom.
[00:57:00.728 --> 00:57:05.889]  And then, you know, have people sweeping the woods for a Jack Daniel's bottle.
[00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:08.890]  No, you want to find terrorists in the official terror paradigm.
[00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:17.404]  Then you've got to go to the Muslim communities and, you know, go to the inner city areas and radical mosques that are known to preach a certain way.
[00:57:17.404 --> 00:57:20.106]  But there's no real terrorism there either.
[00:57:20.106 --> 00:57:22.146]  And so, see, now they say the terrorists are everywhere.
[00:57:22.146 --> 00:57:24.728]  There's thousands of secret white Al-Qaeda.
[00:57:24.728 --> 00:57:31.531]  And so, let's just randomly search everyone in Memphis and then they just randomly are on the street corners searching people.
[00:57:31.531 --> 00:57:35.932]  I mean, that is... Let's find a 58 Studebaker.
[00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:40.236]  And where do we look for a 58 Studebaker?
[00:57:40.236 --> 00:57:43.699]  Do we go online and go to the classic car websites?
[00:57:43.699 --> 00:57:44.960]  No!
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:45.260]  No!
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:59.212]  Let's just drop someone with a parachute at 30,000 feet randomly out over Kentucky and let's have him parachute into a cow pasture and he may find a 58 Studebaker!
[00:57:59.212 --> 00:58:02.514]  Now that's if you're officially believing they're really fighting terrorists.
[00:58:02.514 --> 00:58:05.417]  When you read this article though, it says all crime is terrorism.
[00:58:06.565 --> 00:58:10.767]  You see, ah, therefore no Fourth Amendment.
[00:58:10.767 --> 00:58:13.948]  Randomly searching everyone without a fourth.
[00:58:13.948 --> 00:58:15.028]  It's over, folks.
[00:58:15.028 --> 00:58:17.469]  This is preparation for martial law.
[00:58:17.469 --> 00:58:21.991]  Just like they have military drills in every city, getting you ready for them to take over your city, all.
[00:58:21.991 --> 00:58:27.292]  And the documents admit it, and the PDD admits it, and the executive order admits it.
[00:58:27.292 --> 00:58:28.553]  And what are they going to do when it happens?
[00:58:28.553 --> 00:58:31.554]  Take all your pension funds, take all your stocks and bonds,
[00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:39.312]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:45.079 --> 00:58:46.480]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:49.323]  A new world order.
[00:58:49.323 --> 00:58:53.728]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:54.395 --> 00:58:57.037]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:57.037 --> 00:58:59.818]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.818 --> 00:59:03.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:10.325]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:18.794]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.794 --> 00:59:22.677]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:22.677 --> 00:59:25.238]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:25.238 --> 00:59:26.399]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:26.399 --> 00:59:27.180]  They're not after money.
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:28.441]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:28.441 --> 00:59:29.441]  They're after power.
[00:59:29.441 --> 00:59:30.602]  That's what happens here.

[00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:42.092]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:42.092 --> 00:59:47.278]  You have been warned.
[00:59:47.278 --> 00:59:49.681]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.681 --> 00:59:52.443]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.641 --> 01:00:00.383]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:00.383 --> 01:00:01.964]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.964 --> 01:00:03.526]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.526 --> 01:00:07.710]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:12.655]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.655 --> 01:00:19.902]  They are simulating in public schools nationwide taking 6th and 7th graders to FEMA camps.
[01:00:19.902 --> 01:00:20.803]  Mainstream news.
[01:00:21.543 --> 01:00:35.569]  They simulate, quote, militia gun owners and homeschoolers murdering the children and killing them nationwide, traumatizing them in psych warfare to go to camps to report on their parents and that gun owners are bad.
[01:00:35.569 --> 01:00:40.611]  Hardcore psych warfare run by the behavioral psychologist.
[01:00:40.611 --> 01:00:45.432]  On top of that, all over the nation they are federalizing police.
[01:00:45.432 --> 01:00:49.134]  They are doing urban warfare drills, Marines, Army, many cases.
[01:00:50.623 --> 01:00:53.023]  Foreign troops are with them.
[01:00:53.023 --> 01:00:56.164]  Repeat, foreign troops are with them in many cases.
[01:00:56.164 --> 01:01:00.605]  We have video of this, mainstream news articles.
[01:01:00.605 --> 01:01:08.346]  And then this, law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terrorism initiative, commercial appeal Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:01:08.346 --> 01:01:13.707]  Now you type that headline in and click web, you'll get hundreds of articles around the country.
[01:01:13.707 --> 01:01:15.988]  Just like Homeland Security announced two days ago,
[01:01:17.743 --> 01:01:24.065]  Anyone detained, anyone stopped by, quote, federal officers will have their DNA taken.
[01:01:24.065 --> 01:01:29.867]  They took DNA at checkpoints and randomly stopped people on the street, pedestrians.
[01:01:29.867 --> 01:01:37.729]  Hundreds of officers from 50 agencies violated their Fourth Amendment saying it was anti-terror.
[01:01:37.729 --> 01:01:39.430]  Setting the precedent.
[01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:42.891]  Now remember, this is like what I said earlier.
[01:01:42.891 --> 01:01:46.632]  If you wanted a bottle of Jack Daniels or Jim Beam,
[01:01:47.729 --> 01:01:50.450]  Or Grey Goose Vodka?
[01:01:50.450 --> 01:02:05.974]  Would you go to a liquor store, or would you have someone take you up on a plane, put a blindfold on you, fly in a random direction 1,000 miles, and then have you jump out and parachute to the ground to look for Grey Goose Vodka?
[01:02:05.974 --> 01:02:14.837]  No, you would, if you were looking for a Walmart, would you go to a Walmart, or would you have someone put you in a plane and randomly throw you out somewhere?
[01:02:17.157 --> 01:02:18.718]  But it's even more rare than that.
[01:02:18.718 --> 01:02:33.247]  It would be like looking for a 57 Chevy with a candy, fire engine red, glossy original paint job with creamy white fenders and red leather seats.
[01:02:33.247 --> 01:02:39.431]  Would you be taken in a bus, randomly driven to the middle of nowhere, and then dumped out?
[01:02:39.431 --> 01:02:40.472]  Is that how you'd find the 57 Chevy?
[01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:47.348]  This is if you believe terrorism's real and not totally manufactured in this country.
[01:02:47.348 --> 01:02:50.891]  There is some real terrorism internationally, but generally that's even provocateur.
[01:02:50.891 --> 01:02:51.652]  It's very rare.
[01:02:51.652 --> 01:02:54.974]  It's like finding a leprechaun or a unicorn.
[01:02:54.974 --> 01:02:56.315]  I don't really believe those exist.
[01:02:56.315 --> 01:02:57.256]  That's the whole point.
[01:02:57.256 --> 01:02:58.437]  It's mythical.
[01:02:58.437 --> 01:03:03.781]  This is a new myth, a new mythos, a new religion given to you by the behavioral psychologist.
[01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:07.403]  So they have hundreds and hundreds of police randomly searching everyone.
[01:03:07.403 --> 01:03:09.285]  It's actually thousands of police from 50 agencies.
[01:03:10.624 --> 01:03:17.050]  Running around randomly in major cities and small towns, searching people randomly.
[01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:17.991]  Just like they do in New York.
[01:03:17.991 --> 01:03:20.393]  They just randomly tell you to line up, they search you now.
[01:03:20.393 --> 01:03:21.595]  They had 500,000 stops in 2006.
[01:03:21.595 --> 01:03:23.236]  Those numbers came out in 2007.
[01:03:23.236 --> 01:03:24.597]  We'll assume that the 2007 numbers in 2008.
[01:03:24.597 --> 01:03:24.838]  500 plus was 521,000.
[01:03:33.297 --> 01:03:34.297]  That came out a few months ago.
[01:03:34.297 --> 01:03:39.500]  521,000 stops in 2006, up from 300-something thousand the year before.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.440]  Random ones!
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.162]  Just, you'll be there in New York and they'll just block a street off and search everyone randomly.
[01:03:45.162 --> 01:03:50.605]  Now going nationwide under Homeland Security control.
[01:03:50.605 --> 01:03:54.766]  Law enforcement agencies join together for full anti-terrorism initiative.
[01:03:54.766 --> 01:03:57.328]  Shelby County Sheriff's deputies arrested.
[01:03:57.328 --> 01:03:59.328]  See, this is an article telling you how great it is.
[01:03:59.328 --> 01:04:00.249]  The Knoxville paper
[01:04:01.926 --> 01:04:09.022]  Said that it was ridiculous and that they could have gone... They actually said they could have gone to one street where heroin is known to be sold and busted people.
[01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:13.364]  There was actually an article against this when you Google it, but this one's pro.
[01:04:13.364 --> 01:04:19.007]  Shelby County Sheriff's deputies arrested 71 people, including 31 fugitives, during a 24-hour street sweep.
[01:04:19.007 --> 01:04:25.190]  A street sweep, like they had in Germany's, that ended about half an hour after sunrise Sunday.
[01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:31.853]  The Sheriff's Office and 50 federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies pulled over cars, climbed on boats,
[01:04:32.677 --> 01:04:38.379]  And served fugitive warrants as part of an anti-terrorism initiative called Operation Sudden Impact.
[01:04:38.379 --> 01:04:44.222]  Anti-terror, checkpoints, fugitive, and then it goes on.
[01:04:44.222 --> 01:04:46.162]  They were scanning license plates, everything.
[01:04:46.162 --> 01:04:49.924]  It was a martial law drill, and local police admitted.
[01:04:51.474 --> 01:04:54.316]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:04:54.316 --> 01:04:55.877]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:04:55.877 --> 01:04:58.039]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:04:58.039 --> 01:04:59.940]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.441]  The late great USA.
[01:05:01.441 --> 01:05:03.202]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:07:44.403 --> 01:07:44.663]  That's 646-498-5309.
[01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:16.311]  Section 802 of H.R.
[01:08:16.311 --> 01:08:27.661]  3162, the USA Patriot Act, that Congress passed while four of its six office buildings were shut down under anthrax government biological weapon attack that I predicted here on air.
[01:08:28.726 --> 01:08:32.027]  The most weaponized form ever known from Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[01:08:32.027 --> 01:08:34.648]  And now in the mainstream news reports, they believe the U.S.
[01:08:34.648 --> 01:08:37.369]  government, a branch of it, launched the attack.
[01:08:37.369 --> 01:08:47.913]  Enemies of the Bush administration were, of course, the ones that were mailed the anthrax.
[01:08:47.913 --> 01:08:55.156]  Now, all of that is going on, and it says in Section 802 that all misdemeanors are acts of terrorism.
[01:08:56.741 --> 01:09:00.364]  And so that there's no Bill of Rights or due process for anyone.
[01:09:00.364 --> 01:09:08.350]  And then you've got headlines out of AP within a year of it being passed saying local prosecutors use Patriot Act thousands of times.
[01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:10.331]  And that would be per state.
[01:09:10.331 --> 01:09:12.713]  And they just announced everything is now terrorism.
[01:09:12.713 --> 01:09:17.056]  See, first they get you trained as terrorism, then they say everything is terrorism.
[01:09:17.056 --> 01:09:25.142]  And... I mean, how ridiculous is it that, oh, we're gonna have random sweeps in random cities looking for terrorists.
[01:09:26.167 --> 01:09:27.808]  And what do the manuals say?
[01:09:27.808 --> 01:09:29.349]  People that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:30.050]  Constitution.
[01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:32.452]  Those that talk about Jesus Christ.
[01:09:32.452 --> 01:09:34.914]  Those that have firearms.
[01:09:34.914 --> 01:09:41.539]  Law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terrorism initiative in Memphis, Tennessee and surrounding areas.
[01:09:41.539 --> 01:09:44.061]  Shelby County Sheriff's deputies arrested 71 people during 31
[01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:46.410]  Fugitives?
[01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:49.851]  That's because they went to fugitives where it was for warrants.
[01:09:49.851 --> 01:09:53.112]  When you go look at most of his traffic offenses, they knew where they were.
[01:09:53.112 --> 01:09:56.053]  They just did it to make it part of the terrorism.
[01:09:56.053 --> 01:09:58.613]  They arrested 31 terrorists!
[01:09:58.613 --> 01:10:00.334]  So that's the psychology.
[01:10:00.334 --> 01:10:09.996]  Shelby County Sheriff's Deputies arrested 71 people including 31 fugitives during a 24-hour street sweep that ended about half an hour after sunrise Sunday.
[01:10:10.942 --> 01:10:24.780]  The sheriff's office and 50 federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies under federal control pulled over cars, climbed on boats in the river, served fugitive warrants as part of an anti-terrorism initiative called Operation Sudden Impact.
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:29.826]  We have local newscasts where it shows them running checkpoints on the streets and just randomly arresting people.
[01:10:31.098 --> 01:10:32.278]  And it has a photo.
[01:10:32.278 --> 01:10:36.459]  Special Agent Don Wolf of the West Tennessee Judicial Violent Crime Task Force.
[01:10:36.459 --> 01:10:38.659]  See, that Violent Crime Task Force fights terror.
[01:10:38.659 --> 01:10:47.741]  And Drug Task Force with his dog, Hydro, conducts a search of a tugboat with Petty Officer Second Class Rich Guthrie of the U.S.
[01:10:47.741 --> 01:10:48.341]  Coast Guard.
[01:10:48.341 --> 01:10:50.001]  See, you got the police working with the military.
[01:10:50.001 --> 01:10:51.742]  It's now under military control.
[01:10:51.742 --> 01:10:54.422]  During Operation Sudden Impact.
[01:10:54.422 --> 01:10:55.002]  That's right.
[01:10:55.002 --> 01:10:56.762]  Using the military against the American people.
[01:10:56.762 --> 01:10:58.383]  It's what it's all about.
[01:10:58.383 --> 01:11:00.363]  Like any good third world banana boat country.
[01:11:01.104 --> 01:11:05.786]  Richard Pillsbury works in the Sheriff's Office of Homeland Security Command Center.
[01:11:05.786 --> 01:11:11.469]  Those are the federalization centers where they scan your plates, track your cell phones in real time, destroy America.
[01:11:11.469 --> 01:11:13.890]  I would call it the Freedom Destruction Center.
[01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:19.093]  The federalization, the regional governors will keep the local systems in line.
[01:11:19.093 --> 01:11:20.133]  That's what it is.
[01:11:20.133 --> 01:11:21.114]  Richard Pillsbury
[01:11:22.435 --> 01:11:25.857]  Works for the Sheriff's Office of Homeland Security Command Center.
[01:11:25.857 --> 01:11:30.580]  The office coordinated a regional crime suppression initiative over the weekend.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:31.000]  Oh!
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.241]  As part of the terror fighting initiative.
[01:11:33.241 --> 01:11:35.042]  See how they're interchanging that now?
[01:11:35.042 --> 01:11:41.546]  Coordinated a regional crime suppression initiative over the weekend that involved officers from more than 50 federal states and local agencies.
[01:11:41.546 --> 01:11:42.847]  See?
[01:11:42.847 --> 01:11:45.769]  They got to fight the commie system, where they funded the communists.
[01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:47.990]  They've got to fight the drugs, where they ship them in.
[01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:50.011]  Now it's fight the terrorists, which is all crime.
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:57.642]  And it goes on and on with photos and the things.
[01:11:57.642 --> 01:12:09.470]  It was the first time that many agencies joined forces for such a large sweep, said Shelby County Sheriff Mark Luttrell, whose offices coordinated the operation, even though Memphis hasn't suffered a terrorist attack
[01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:13.812]  The city is using federal grants to fight crime!
[01:12:13.812 --> 01:12:16.233]  Federalizing the po- and see the SWAT teams?
[01:12:16.233 --> 01:12:18.274]  It's all designed for mass arrest.
[01:12:18.274 --> 01:12:22.035]  They've trained the police nationwide on how to drive the buses for mass arrest.
[01:12:22.035 --> 01:12:25.677]  They have regional relocation centers at every airport.
[01:12:25.677 --> 01:12:28.978]  Uh, here in Austin, in both airports, the old one and the new one.
[01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:33.100]  You see, this is all about training them as a combat force against the people, publicly.
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:36.862]  It's now in the executive orders and defense spending, so it's not just my opinion now.
[01:12:38.445 --> 01:12:48.730]  Even though Memphis hasn't suffered a terror attack, the city is using federal grants to fight crime, which might lead to the discovery of a terrorist suspect.
[01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:52.232]  Oh, they might magically find a tooth fairy.
[01:12:52.232 --> 01:12:56.834]  They might jump out of a helicopter with a parachute and find a four-leaf clover where they land.
[01:12:56.834 --> 01:12:59.535]  Other cities using federal money with similar programs.
[01:13:00.339 --> 01:13:05.360]  Our community is considering an international distribution center.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:17.882]  And as possible target for terrorists, said Captain Dale Lane, commander of the Sheriff's Office of Homeland Security Bureau, which that's the political police commissariat, where they break the law and spawn people without warrants.
[01:13:17.882 --> 01:13:28.244]  The hundred sheriff's deputies working Saturday night and Saturday morning with 50 other agencies also recovered 12.12 grams of heroin where our troops guard it in Afghanistan publicly.
[01:13:29.146 --> 01:13:30.706]  Just so sick.
[01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:35.868]  19 syringes and seized $1,795.
[01:13:35.868 --> 01:13:41.209]  They issued citations at 202 traffic stops in an anti-terror sweep.
[01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:46.690]  Information gathered in the sweep will be reviewed by intelligence officers at the local Homeland Security Center.
[01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:51.191]  The information will be forwarded to State Homeland Security Center in Nashville and forwarded from there to the feds.
[01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:56.517]  Other agencies that participated in the sweep will release results from their departments today.
[01:13:56.517 --> 01:14:01.199]  Contact Cindy Wolf and it's got our number to read more stories by this reporter.
[01:14:01.199 --> 01:14:04.400]  Oh my goodness, aren't we safe now?
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.141]  Aren't we safe from Al-Qaeda?
[01:14:07.141 --> 01:14:09.883]  I think we got our time zones crossed as we routinely do.
[01:14:09.883 --> 01:14:14.284]  Bob Chapman, then I'm going to move to the next hour briefly with an economic report.
[01:14:14.284 --> 01:14:16.986]  Then we got William Lewis into the fourth hour today.
[01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:20.147]  If we're able to swing that, he didn't call in as he normally does.
[01:14:21.212 --> 01:14:23.313]  Must be out on the golf course right now.
[01:14:23.313 --> 01:14:25.055]  That's okay, we always appreciate Bob.
[01:14:25.055 --> 01:14:27.536]  We'll get those time zones straight and get him on.
[01:14:27.536 --> 01:14:30.979]  And, uh, we do have William Lewis, maker of Washington You're Fired.
[01:14:30.979 --> 01:14:34.141]  Ooh, that hurts the infrastructure.
[01:14:34.141 --> 01:14:35.321]  That hurts belief in the government.
[01:14:35.321 --> 01:14:37.343]  You should be arrested for that, Michael Savage says.
[01:14:37.343 --> 01:14:39.584]  The good conservative.
[01:14:39.584 --> 01:14:42.186]  Uh, but I do have a bunch of other news I need to cover here.
[01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:45.588]  Oh, man, we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:14:45.588 --> 01:14:49.291]  Uh, let me shift gears now into their other major prong attack.
[01:14:51.283 --> 01:14:58.850]  They have the anti-terror initiative that now fights the blonde-haired blue-eyed Al-Qaeda, they say, are everywhere.
[01:14:58.850 --> 01:15:01.772]  Let me shift gears to another facet of terror.
[01:15:01.772 --> 01:15:07.317]  I have the front page of the Austin American-Statesman today.
[01:15:07.317 --> 01:15:10.040]  And it has the yogurt shop DNA not tied to defendants.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:15.464]  The police on video put guns to their heads and said they would kill them if they didn't sign the document saying they did it.
[01:15:15.464 --> 01:15:18.347]  So they did, but now they've tested their DNA and of course it's not them.
[01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:20.704]  That's because we know who killed the girls.
[01:15:20.704 --> 01:15:23.626]  It was a local devil cult that runs the city.
[01:15:23.626 --> 01:15:24.266]  That doesn't matter.
[01:15:24.266 --> 01:15:25.447]  The devil cult can convict them.
[01:15:25.447 --> 01:15:27.209]  So does Patsy's.
[01:15:27.209 --> 01:15:29.010]  Here's another story.
[01:15:29.010 --> 01:15:29.891]  You think I'm joking?
[01:15:29.891 --> 01:15:31.893]  Mainline investigators say who it is.
[01:15:31.893 --> 01:15:33.934]  Go look into it.
[01:15:33.934 --> 01:15:36.817]  A man found in Lake was a teacher.
[01:15:36.817 --> 01:15:38.678]  Faced FBI inquiry.
[01:15:38.678 --> 01:15:41.521]  Now, Raeed Hamad.
[01:15:41.521 --> 01:15:42.401]  And guess what?
[01:15:42.401 --> 01:15:44.123]  They say he committed suicide!
[01:15:45.239 --> 01:15:46.979]  He was bound and gagged.
[01:15:46.979 --> 01:15:52.821]  Now, folks, if you find me bound and gagged, that's how dumb they think you are now.
[01:15:52.821 --> 01:16:00.862]  I mean, they grab a cop of the year who exposed Oklahoma City being government-op, stabbed him dozens of times, shot him twice in the back of the head, torture, stun marks.
[01:16:00.862 --> 01:16:04.663]  He called his partner, said, the feds are behind me, following me.
[01:16:04.663 --> 01:16:07.584]  You know, he was going to his secret locker where he had evidence of an inside job.
[01:16:08.889 --> 01:16:20.413]  I mean, there have been cases with Fannie Malick in Arkansas where they cut your head off, pour gasoline on you, arms and legs cut off, bullet holes, and folks, you can't cut your arms and legs and head off and pour gasoline on yourself.
[01:16:20.413 --> 01:16:22.714]  Let me just give you a news flash.
[01:16:22.714 --> 01:16:29.416]  But this guy, new details emerge about body found at Lady Bird Lake, that's the Colorado they named after her now.
[01:16:30.206 --> 01:16:35.170]  Grief counselors, uh, are at... Her nephew calls for ending the Constitution, by the way.
[01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:36.911]  Uh, Mr. Bobbitt.
[01:16:36.911 --> 01:16:43.956]  Grief counselors are at Clint Small Middle School in Southwest Austin today to help students cope with the death of a teacher.
[01:16:43.956 --> 01:16:48.459]  The teacher, Raeed Hameed, taught a business computer class there, according to ASID website.
[01:16:48.459 --> 01:16:53.322]  After discovering his body in Lady Bird Lake Wednesday, Austin police now believe Hameed committed suicide.
[01:16:53.322 --> 01:16:58.646]  Investigators ask for witnesses who may have seen Hameed at the lake before his death to come forward.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:15.592]  And then you read deeper into the other articles, and it says, Austin Police, Thursday, that they are learning, leaning towards a ruling of suicide in the death of a middle school teacher, an activist, oh, activist, whose body was found Wednesday in Lady Bird Lake, with his hands and legs bound and tape over his eyes.
[01:17:15.592 --> 01:17:18.274]  Oh!
[01:17:18.274 --> 01:17:23.017]  They are scientifically engaging in brainwashing.
[01:17:23.017 --> 01:17:27.681]  Folks, you don't... He had tape over his mouth, bound and gagged.
[01:17:27.681 --> 01:17:29.422]  I mean, please, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:35.720]  They put a picture of a burning Constitution.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:40.024]  Soon they'll have neighbors saying, yeah, 50 guys stormed Alex Jones' house.
[01:17:40.024 --> 01:17:41.385]  I pray this isn't the case.
[01:17:41.385 --> 01:17:42.566]  And there was machine gun fire.
[01:17:42.566 --> 01:17:44.888]  He committed suicide.
[01:17:44.888 --> 01:17:52.355]  I mean, soon they'll be hanging us from helicopters, you know, with nooses in front of a sports stadium saying it was suicide.
[01:17:52.355 --> 01:17:55.318]  I told you folks Rush Limbaugh would endorse Hillary.
[01:17:56.403 --> 01:18:00.007]  Now, all the big conservatives have endorsed global warming and want a global tax.
[01:18:00.007 --> 01:18:02.569]  That's coming up next.
[01:18:02.569 --> 01:18:07.293]  Man found in lake was teacher faced FBI inquiry.
[01:18:07.293 --> 01:18:15.141]  Police identified Hameed, Raeed Hameed, 55, at the news conference Thursday and said, burping on air,
[01:18:16.027 --> 01:18:28.454]  Police identified Reid Hameed 55 at a news conference Thursday and said the binding of his limbs was the placement of tape was consistent with Hameed having done it himself.
[01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:34.858]  Just like they kept telling Gary Webb that he was going to be killed.
[01:18:34.858 --> 01:18:42.462]  And then he moved because he pulled up to his house about a year before he was killed and they were climbing up to his second story down off the drain running off.
[01:18:42.462 --> 01:18:43.523]  He told everybody about it.
[01:18:45.776 --> 01:18:54.665]  He then moved and was coming out with a new book proving that the CIA was dealing the drugs.
[01:18:54.665 --> 01:19:00.550]  And they came to his house and shot him twice in the head, once in the back, once on the side.
[01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:11.080]  And then his quote friend, who he had written articles about saying wasn't his friend, came out and said, I was wrong, that it was quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head.
[01:19:13.906 --> 01:19:16.867]  And, of course, sometimes there's even suicide notes.
[01:19:16.867 --> 01:19:26.089]  You come into your house and somebody says, hands up, so you don't resist and say, I'm just an officer, Mr. Jones, it's fine, or Mr. Webb, it's fine, right here.
[01:19:26.089 --> 01:19:37.172]  And they put you in handcuffs and they say, listen, we're gonna kill your kids if you don't write this right now, we're gonna kill you, you know why we're here to do this, and your life's over, son of a bitch, you messed up.
[01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:39.050]  Don't you know we're the winners?
[01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:42.692]  Now, you're gonna write this right now to your family, or we're gonna kill them too.
[01:19:42.692 --> 01:19:43.612]  And you know what?
[01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:51.814]  You write the letter, they shoot you in the head repeatedly, sometimes they shotgun you in the body, sometimes they cut your arms and legs off, and they say you commit suicide.
[01:19:51.814 --> 01:19:53.115]  It is a big idea.
[01:19:54.269 --> 01:19:56.049]  A New World Order.
[01:19:56.049 --> 01:20:00.931]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:00.931 --> 01:20:03.771]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:03.771 --> 01:20:06.572]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:06.572 --> 01:20:09.733]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:09.733 --> 01:20:17.055]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:20.103 --> 01:20:25.527]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:25.527 --> 01:20:29.409]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:29.409 --> 01:20:31.971]  Build America is making great progress toward a world with government.
[01:20:31.971 --> 01:20:33.132]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:33.132 --> 01:20:33.932]  They're not after money.
[01:20:33.932 --> 01:20:35.213]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:35.213 --> 01:20:36.174]  They're after power.
[01:20:36.174 --> 01:20:37.335]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:20:54.046 --> 01:20:59.570]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?

[01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:06.775]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:06.775 --> 01:21:15.781]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[01:23:46.294 --> 01:24:04.108]  Raeed Amid is a nonviolent activist in Austin.
[01:24:04.108 --> 01:24:05.849]  This is Free Speech TV, Link.
[01:24:05.849 --> 01:24:07.591]  He's been on Democracy Now!
[01:24:10.208 --> 01:24:13.489]  He holds multiple master's degrees and has never been arrested.
[01:24:13.489 --> 01:24:22.793]  He is now under surveillance by the FBI because he has organized the shipment of books, school books, to Palestinian children.
[01:24:22.793 --> 01:24:30.316]  He speaks about the impact that FBI attacks have had on his family, his freedoms, and his perception of America.
[01:24:30.316 --> 01:24:36.198]  And later we're going to place an audio clip of this on air.
[01:24:36.198 --> 01:24:39.700]  And he was bound, gagged, had tape over his mouth,
[01:24:42.233 --> 01:24:48.801]  And the FBI says he committed suicide.
[01:24:48.801 --> 01:24:56.751]  Now, in Arkansas, they have cut people's heads off and arms off and poured gasoline on them and said it was suicide.
[01:24:56.751 --> 01:24:57.832]  This is your government.
[01:25:00.157 --> 01:25:07.841]  Now, I don't know if the Jewish Defense League or some other group, those are suspects.
[01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:09.001]  FBI are suspects.
[01:25:09.001 --> 01:25:12.363]  I mean, if they'll kill Cop of the Year, Terrence Yakey, they'll kill anybody.
[01:25:12.363 --> 01:25:13.704]  And believe me, I don't like talking about it.
[01:25:13.704 --> 01:25:15.625]  These are hardcore killers, folks.
[01:25:15.625 --> 01:25:17.025]  They'll kill you in a second.
[01:25:17.025 --> 01:25:20.207]  Certain divisions of the FBI, key cadres of anti-terror.
[01:25:21.101 --> 01:25:23.522]  Most of them have been recruited out of special forces.
[01:25:23.522 --> 01:25:27.084]  They're the types that were involved wiring up the World Trade Centers.
[01:25:27.084 --> 01:25:31.747]  And I mean, I take no pleasure having to speak out against these guys.
[01:25:31.747 --> 01:25:32.768]  They like to kill people.
[01:25:32.768 --> 01:25:35.649]  They'll probably kill me one day.
[01:25:35.649 --> 01:25:38.351]  But the killing has to stop sometimes.
[01:25:38.351 --> 01:25:43.033]  You know, the raping of the country, the destruction of our liberties, somebody's got to fight them.
[01:25:43.033 --> 01:25:46.495]  And I can't believe that they murdered this guy.
[01:25:46.495 --> 01:25:49.237]  And this is their perfect MO, because it's an arrogant
[01:25:50.882 --> 01:25:51.583]  It's a signal.
[01:25:51.583 --> 01:25:54.585]  For everybody that has a brain, it's, hey, we're killers.
[01:25:54.585 --> 01:25:56.546]  Back off.
[01:25:56.546 --> 01:26:01.470]  And for everybody else, it's just further conditioning.
[01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:04.852]  I just hope if they kill me, just don't believe them.
[01:26:04.852 --> 01:26:06.373]  I will never commit suicide.
[01:26:06.373 --> 01:26:07.754]  I love life.
[01:26:07.754 --> 01:26:09.996]  I enjoy life.
[01:26:09.996 --> 01:26:15.159]  I just love it with gusto and every ounce of my body.
[01:26:15.159 --> 01:26:17.441]  And they have killed a lot of people.
[01:26:17.441 --> 01:26:19.983]  A lot of people go for decades before they kill them.
[01:26:20.703 --> 01:26:23.045]  And it's a big topic of discussion of why I'm still alive.
[01:26:23.045 --> 01:26:24.686]  It's because I'm so vocal.
[01:26:24.686 --> 01:26:30.250]  And I'm not even saying everybody in the FBI is bad, or every cop's bad, but the system is bad.
[01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:34.614]  And, uh... You wanna go ahead?
[01:26:34.614 --> 01:26:38.016]  Do we have time to play this clip?
[01:26:38.016 --> 01:26:41.139]  Yeah, we'll play it later, as we got a little guest coming up, and we got another guest coming up.
[01:26:41.139 --> 01:26:43.100]  We'll play it before the, uh, show ends.
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:47.423]  I've got another big issue here I wanna cover, too.
[01:26:47.423 --> 01:26:48.144]  Shifting gears.
[01:26:49.221 --> 01:26:55.963]  Folks, if you give in to them, if you let the fear work on you, it's over for our society.
[01:26:55.963 --> 01:26:59.684]  I got another article here I wanted to cover.
[01:26:59.684 --> 01:27:02.165]  Bush halts CO2 growth.
[01:27:02.165 --> 01:27:07.927]  President Bush called for halting the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, and they're calling for global taxes, carbon taxes.
[01:27:07.927 --> 01:27:14.229]  Now this is a tax to regulate every facet of your life, to make humans the enemy, as Richard Haass, the head of the CFR, said.
[01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:16.970]  He said it's fake, it's manufactured in a public document,
[01:27:17.893 --> 01:27:20.656]  We covered it a few weeks ago on air, publicly put out.
[01:27:20.656 --> 01:27:22.318]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[01:27:22.318 --> 01:27:32.969]  And he said it's terrorism and global warming are the unifying systems to, quote, make humans the enemy and the state the instrument to deal with the enemy.
[01:27:32.969 --> 01:27:35.771]  He said, humans the enemy.
[01:27:35.771 --> 01:27:37.834]  He said that's what it is.
[01:27:37.834 --> 01:27:39.075]  Exactly what I told you.
[01:27:40.086 --> 01:27:42.289]  Point blank, the state against us.
[01:27:42.289 --> 01:27:44.612]  This is what we exhale, it makes us the enemy.
[01:27:44.612 --> 01:27:52.022]  Not toxic waste, not burning down rainforests, not genetic engineering, not nuclear weapons, all these things that really are dangerous.
[01:27:52.022 --> 01:27:54.445]  What plants breathe, what we exhale, is the enemy.
[01:27:56.167 --> 01:28:08.117]  And now Newt Gingrich, Nancy Pelosi have gotten together with TV ads, Al Sharpton, Pat Robertson, TV ads, paid for with government tax money, telling you it's all real, leaving it real vague.
[01:28:08.117 --> 01:28:11.400]  Everyone will have social workers in your home many times a year.
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:12.841]  It's already started in England.
[01:28:12.841 --> 01:28:15.563]  One child policy, they're going to tax you if you have more than one.
[01:28:15.563 --> 01:28:16.824]  They're now announcing it.
[01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:18.546]  I mean, total control.
[01:28:18.546 --> 01:28:21.148]  Let's play the first one with Al Sharpton and Pat Robertson.
[01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:24.990]  You ready for that?
[01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:26.551]  We're polar opposites.
[01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:28.311]  We couldn't be further apart.
[01:28:28.311 --> 01:28:29.171]  I'm on the left.
[01:28:29.171 --> 01:28:30.752]  And I'm usually right.
[01:28:30.752 --> 01:28:32.552]  And we strongly disagree.
[01:28:32.552 --> 01:28:34.112]  Except on one issue.
[01:28:34.112 --> 01:28:35.753]  Tell them what it is, Reverend Pack.
[01:28:35.753 --> 01:28:37.313]  That would be our planet.
[01:28:37.313 --> 01:28:40.054]  Taking care of it is extremely important.
[01:28:40.054 --> 01:28:43.735]  We all need to work together, liberals and conservatives.
[01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:45.175]  So get involved.
[01:28:45.175 --> 01:28:47.176]  It's the right thing to do.
[01:28:47.176 --> 01:28:48.196]  Now there you go again.
[01:28:49.056 --> 01:28:49.736]  Join us.
[01:28:49.736 --> 01:28:51.818]  Together, we can solve the climate crisis.
[01:28:51.818 --> 01:28:53.699]  Go to WeCanSolveIt.org.
[01:28:53.699 --> 01:29:04.705]  Now, this psych warfare piece you heard made by the behavioral, uh, technocrats, behavioral psychologists, reaffirms the left-right paradigm to try to keep us in that at each other's throats.
[01:29:04.705 --> 01:29:11.789]  So it promotes division, but then unity, when you go to the link, it calls for global taxes and regulation.
[01:29:11.789 --> 01:29:14.271]  See?
[01:29:14.271 --> 01:29:18.213]  And then the next one we'll play is Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich.
[01:29:19.901 --> 01:29:23.384]  They're moving against free humanity now.
[01:29:23.384 --> 01:29:27.407]  To the FBI agents committing the murders, to all of you.
[01:29:27.407 --> 01:29:30.289]  Look into how they put it in your water, the fluoride.
[01:29:30.289 --> 01:29:32.030]  Look at what they gave your children.
[01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:33.631]  They're attacking you, too.
[01:29:33.631 --> 01:29:35.753]  Please, join us.
[01:29:35.753 --> 01:29:41.998]  They're killing you, too.
[01:29:41.998 --> 01:29:43.379]  We're on the march.
[01:29:43.379 --> 01:29:45.920]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.602]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:54.791]  The election cycle draws near, and we don't have much time left.
[01:29:54.791 --> 01:30:01.693]  If the American people truly hope to make a change in Washington, then we must act now with a cohesive plan for taking back our government.
[01:30:01.693 --> 01:30:06.075]  Washington, You're Fired is a new patriotic documentary from the director of Beyond Treason.
[01:30:06.075 --> 01:30:15.158]  The video is the result of a two-year endeavor to assemble a video tool for engaging, educating, and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of Congress.
[01:30:15.478 --> 01:30:23.525]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[01:30:23.525 --> 01:30:28.308]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with only two choices.
[01:30:28.308 --> 01:30:31.231]  Be a part of the problem, or be a part of the solution.
[01:30:31.231 --> 01:30:38.497]  Washington You're Fired is being described as the best patriotic video since Freedom to Fascism, and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.
[01:30:39.057 --> 01:30:40.739]  We invite you to make the change.
[01:30:40.739 --> 01:30:42.600]  Help take back our government now.

[01:31:51.144 --> 01:31:51.604]  Fact.
[01:31:51.604 --> 01:31:57.628]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[01:31:57.628 --> 01:32:01.951]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[01:32:01.951 --> 01:32:09.636]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[01:32:09.636 --> 01:32:10.377]  The solution.
[01:32:10.377 --> 01:32:14.600]  Detoxification integrated with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.581]  The LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa.

[01:32:45.437 --> 01:32:46.258]  Come, you masters of war.
[01:32:46.258 --> 01:32:47.299]  Here to build the big guns.
[01:32:47.299 --> 01:32:48.980]  Here to build the death planes.
[01:33:07.321 --> 01:33:07.641]  Coming up...
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:41.225]  I'm gonna get more into Bush to halt CO2 growth, because it's evil.
[01:33:41.225 --> 01:33:44.447]  And it's what humans put out, and humans are bad.
[01:33:44.447 --> 01:33:53.514]  And how they've got total unification by the media to go after humanity, in their own words.
[01:33:55.123 --> 01:33:57.564]  We've also got William Lewis, who's made the new film.
[01:33:57.564 --> 01:33:59.185]  Washington, you're fired.
[01:33:59.185 --> 01:34:06.028]  Joining us coming up in the next hour, and we're going to get Bob Chavin worked in for a pop-in on what's happening with the economy.
[01:34:06.028 --> 01:34:08.349]  Now, I want to be clear about something.
[01:34:08.349 --> 01:34:18.654]  The IMF and the World Bank, in the 2002 documents that got released when Joseph Stiglitz went public, Chief Economist, World Bank,
[01:34:20.231 --> 01:34:41.844]  Talked about how they engineer food calamity, how they want to buy up all the food, how they want to jack up the prices under State Department Memorandum 200 and the Royal Commission on Population put out by the British Crown decades earlier to reduce third world population and to stimulate war between the sides and economic destabilization.
[01:34:41.844 --> 01:34:42.825]  This is all public.
[01:34:42.825 --> 01:34:44.126]  This is the nice people that run things.
[01:34:44.878 --> 01:34:48.280]  Now they're all posing like, oh, they're going to deal with the crisis.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:35:02.769]  They need world taxes, not just for greenhouse gas, not just for carbon dioxide, but to feed the third world, who they love so much, after they've done everything to create worldwide food shortages and riots in scores of countries.
[01:35:02.769 --> 01:35:07.232]  Now, do I think we're not going to have food on the shelves here?
[01:35:07.232 --> 01:35:08.813]  Well, certain things won't be there.
[01:35:08.813 --> 01:35:10.494]  Certain things will cost twice what they did.
[01:35:11.318 --> 01:35:12.639]  Uh, but there'll still be other foods.
[01:35:12.639 --> 01:35:15.820]  The point is, is that food prices are exploding.
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:19.002]  They're talking about depression in a bunch of newspapers today.
[01:35:19.002 --> 01:35:21.583]  I don't know what's gonna happen.
[01:35:21.583 --> 01:35:32.428]  And I'm not saying this is all gonna be the end of everything, but there's a good chance we're going into very, very serious times, and that's why I believe in the insurance policy of storable foods.
[01:35:32.428 --> 01:35:39.351]  And, uh, joining us is Steve Shank, who not only is an expert on this for close to three decades, 27 years, not just that,
[01:35:40.174 --> 01:35:41.595]  I'm glad to be aboard, Alex.
[01:36:04.597 --> 01:36:33.276]  We have had, I'm glad you're so positive that you think that there's going to be food on the shelves, and I guess there will be, but we have had four days of virtual, well, there will come a time in the not very distant future when we will refer to the past week, the first four days of this past week
[01:36:34.242 --> 01:36:37.364]  As the four days in April.
[01:36:37.364 --> 01:36:55.295]  Because at one time, on Monday, we had the United Nations World Food Program announce the fact that officially there was a worldwide food famine emergency.
[01:36:55.295 --> 01:37:02.800]  On that same day, they announced that they were requesting one billion dollars from developed nations
[01:37:03.678 --> 01:37:07.641]  To buy food for underdeveloped nations.
[01:37:07.641 --> 01:37:28.656]  The question that I had to ask, now, if folks want to get up on the eFoodsDirect.com website, there's an editorial that I wrote, I sent it out to all of our people on the email program that we have, and I sent you a copy of it.
[01:37:28.656 --> 01:37:30.918]  And the first question... I've got it!
[01:37:30.918 --> 01:37:31.598]  Go ahead.
[01:37:31.598 --> 01:37:32.539]  No, I'm just saying I've got it.
[01:37:33.317 --> 01:37:34.058]  Yeah.
[01:37:34.058 --> 01:37:38.300]  The first question that we had to ask, folks, was very simple.
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:57.292]  And the same day the United Nations came out and said there is a world food crisis, that same day we got noticed that the major, major rice-producing countries in the world had all shut off any exports to keep all their food in their own borders for their own people because they were already starving.
[01:37:58.704 --> 01:38:15.928]  And that same day, they asked us, as one of the developed nations, to send, to plan to send $500 million, half a billion dollars, by May 1st, to this fund to feed the starving nations.
[01:38:15.928 --> 01:38:22.490]  The question you have to ask yourself is, if they did that on the same day, where do they plan to get the food?
[01:38:22.490 --> 01:38:26.111]  They just said, there's a worldwide food shortage
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.425]  Every nation in the world virtually is shutting down its borders in terms of exporting food.
[01:38:33.425 --> 01:38:37.668]  There's one nation that won't, Alex, and that's the United States.
[01:38:37.668 --> 01:38:52.718]  And the reason the United States won't shut down exports and keep the food for its own people is because all of the food here is controlled by the major agri-corps, which are international, and now we have another situation.
[01:38:53.675 --> 01:38:57.337]  Folks, you need to follow this logic very closely.
[01:38:57.337 --> 01:39:01.559]  It doesn't make sense, but it is logic.
[01:39:01.559 --> 01:39:12.685]  The second day, on Tuesday, CNN reported, if any of you opened up your computers and looked at the news, Mr. Bush
[01:39:14.847 --> 01:39:30.938]  Immediately sent, on the second day, on Monday they asked for the money, on the second day Mr. Bush sent $200 million dollars to the United Nations Fund.
[01:39:30.938 --> 01:39:35.502]  This from a country that already is importing 30% of its food every single day,
[01:39:38.277 --> 01:39:38.698]  Thank you.
[01:39:50.965 --> 01:39:54.107]  We're sending money to buy food that doesn't exist.
[01:39:54.107 --> 01:39:57.069]  Well, Steve, let me try to boil it down.
[01:39:57.069 --> 01:40:02.333]  There's already a massive raw material, food material shortage.
[01:40:02.333 --> 01:40:06.695]  You go in pizza places and they got ads saying massive price increase.
[01:40:06.695 --> 01:40:08.777]  I mean, they're explaining why that's happening.
[01:40:08.777 --> 01:40:13.840]  So now, as the crisis develops worldwide, nations are begging for food.
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:18.023]  That means it will accelerate food shortages that were already apparent here.
[01:40:19.073 --> 01:40:19.433]  Yes.
[01:40:19.433 --> 01:40:21.554]  Now, here's the main thing.
[01:40:21.554 --> 01:40:43.740]  The point I was making, Alex, with the fact that we're the only ones that are not going to close down exports is the fact that that $200 million that has just been sent out of our country is going to buy food, and where it's going to buy food is from the United States.
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:47.781]  So, in other words, what you have just had, folks, is you've had your money sent
[01:40:48.607 --> 01:40:49.288]  I think so.
[01:41:06.488 --> 01:41:07.589]  That's right.
[01:41:07.589 --> 01:41:08.630]  And here's another point.
[01:41:08.630 --> 01:41:10.031]  When you get back to the food issue,
[01:41:26.542 --> 01:41:37.349]  You and I have talked before, and there's only one means by which a family can become independent of the controls that this famine will create.
[01:41:37.349 --> 01:41:45.114]  There will be breadlines, but one thing that I concluded just this last week, Alex, is something that I have never imagined before.
[01:41:45.114 --> 01:41:56.322]  You know I've been screaming up and down that folks have to get in food, otherwise they'll be standing in a breadline and have to bare their butts for the bird flu shot, have to give their kids away, have to give up their guns, all that kind of stuff.
[01:41:57.543 --> 01:41:59.004]  Remember Katrina?
[01:41:59.004 --> 01:42:03.088]  We had bread right there, but there was no bread.
[01:42:03.088 --> 01:42:10.354]  In fact, the military stacked up the food for days and wouldn't give it to them, and it turned out it was a laboratory test.
[01:42:10.354 --> 01:42:20.363]  I mean, the grunts didn't know it, the cops didn't know it, to test and see what we do, and they kept the food away, and they did gun confiscation as they were ordered, so it was an A-plus for tyranny.
[01:42:21.983 --> 01:42:27.024]  Well, and the thing is that what we will have here, there is no food, okay?
[01:42:27.024 --> 01:42:30.405]  That's why the UN declared the problem.
[01:42:30.405 --> 01:42:39.367]  What people don't realize is that $200 million and the rest of the money that the developed nations will give will buy food, but it'll buy our food.
[01:42:39.367 --> 01:42:47.209]  So, if you think that the rationing of corn, the rationing of flour right now, and here's the thing, it used to be when people would ask me,
[01:42:48.535 --> 01:42:58.997]  What to do if they just didn't have enough money to put together a supply with the fruits and vegetables and dairy products and stuff like you have in here for your supply, Alex?
[01:42:58.997 --> 01:43:01.198]  We'd say, okay, at least start with something.
[01:43:01.198 --> 01:43:05.198]  Get some of the basics, like wheat, honey, milk, salt, beans, and rice.
[01:43:05.198 --> 01:43:07.979]  It's not going to be tasty, but you can live on it.
[01:43:07.979 --> 01:43:11.940]  What are the first things that are going short and disappearing?
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:14.920]  Wheat is being rationed!
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.681]  The inexpensive staples have more than doubled.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.783]  And right now, we have families in our country that can't afford to eat.
[01:43:40.197 --> 01:43:46.199]  Their girlfriends' mothers, their boyfriends, their parents are losing their houses.
[01:43:46.199 --> 01:43:48.360]  I mean, all over the country.
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:51.542]  Thousands of retail chains.
[01:43:51.542 --> 01:43:54.563]  Hundreds of medium-sized and big ones going out.
[01:43:54.563 --> 01:43:59.865]  I mean, I'm not trying to... Steve, I hope you're wrong about all this, but no doubt food prices are going to explode.
[01:44:00.425 --> 01:44:04.969]  No doubt that within the next two years we're going to see probably an inflationary depression.
[01:44:04.969 --> 01:44:10.093]  I hope that's not the case, but the writing just gets worse and worse, and all the experts say it will happen.
[01:44:10.093 --> 01:44:11.494]  I'm just trying to say I hope it doesn't.
[01:44:11.494 --> 01:44:13.375]  You know, there's a hope and a prayer.
[01:44:13.375 --> 01:44:22.042]  And I know that with the crises, I know with all the things that are happening, and the talk of war, and Iran, terrorism, that it's good to have storable food.
[01:44:22.042 --> 01:44:23.123]  I've been doing this for 10 years.
[01:44:23.123 --> 01:44:25.705]  You know, it's the real insurance policy.
[01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:29.111]  You know, I mean, you say no food.
[01:44:29.111 --> 01:44:31.151]  I mean, what's going to be short?
[01:44:31.151 --> 01:44:32.072]  What are we not going to have?
[01:44:32.072 --> 01:44:33.792]  What's the time frame?
[01:44:33.792 --> 01:44:36.533]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:44:36.533 --> 01:44:39.894]  First of all, I need to make an announcement.
[01:44:39.894 --> 01:44:47.577]  J. Michael Stevens Group, eFoods Direct, will have a price increase on March 12th.
[01:44:47.577 --> 01:44:49.477]  Okay?
[01:44:49.477 --> 01:44:51.998]  It will not just be a price increase.
[01:44:51.998 --> 01:44:54.419]  You mean April or the next month?
[01:44:55.496 --> 01:44:56.357]  I think so.
[01:45:11.537 --> 01:45:15.400]  At the present buy, what the prices are right now.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:22.584]  We know that by March 12th the prices will change and we will have to pass them along.
[01:45:22.584 --> 01:45:25.386]  But here's the other thing that's more serious.
[01:45:25.386 --> 01:45:27.988]  There will be adjustments in availability.
[01:45:28.744 --> 01:45:37.329]  Right now, for example, to try and get apples, dried apples, to put into a... Steve, Steve, Steve, let me stop you.
[01:45:37.329 --> 01:45:37.910]  I want to be clear.
[01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:45.274]  I talk to you off air, and I know you're getting tons of calls, and it's crazy busy at the factory and everything else, but I want to be clear, because I get things backwards some, too.
[01:45:45.274 --> 01:45:46.295]  Do you mean next March?
[01:45:46.295 --> 01:45:48.656]  Because we just had March, and now it's April?
[01:45:48.656 --> 01:45:49.617]  Or are you... Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:45:49.617 --> 01:45:51.838]  Did I say March?
[01:45:51.838 --> 01:45:52.959]  I meant May.
[01:45:52.959 --> 01:45:53.239]  Okay.
[01:45:53.719 --> 01:45:55.060]  This is April.
[01:45:55.060 --> 01:46:07.086]  Next month, May 12th, is when the price increase is going to go, but also at that time, there will be a severe adjustment of availability, okay?
[01:46:07.086 --> 01:46:15.830]  Things with wheat, with flour in them, are really up for grabs, but we have a rice situation right now.
[01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:17.231]  67% of the rice in the world
[01:46:19.728 --> 01:46:31.153]  In other words, anybody that depends on rice in their supplies, one of the things we're going to start putting up on our website... That's all of Asia, much of Africa, I mean this is unbelievable.
[01:46:31.153 --> 01:46:38.275]  And I've got the news reports right here, but what are you hearing behind the scenes from the suppliers?
[01:46:38.275 --> 01:46:44.278]  What I'm hearing from the suppliers is they're calling us asking if we can sell them some rice.
[01:46:44.278 --> 01:46:46.899]  Suppliers are calling us asking if
[01:46:47.495 --> 01:46:51.443]  We have three major grain suppliers in the West.
[01:46:51.443 --> 01:46:56.473]  Now to be clear, what was it, November, when you went crazy and made a huge food buy?
[01:46:56.473 --> 01:46:57.616]  How long till that runs out?
[01:46:59.166 --> 01:47:04.271]  It's already run out, but we went crazy and contacted a whole bunch of small suppliers.
[01:47:04.271 --> 01:47:14.639]  Right now we picked up two loads of wheat, just to give you an idea, and I apologize for taking the length of time on this one, but it should tell people a message.
[01:47:14.639 --> 01:47:25.829]  We picked up two loads of wheat, two truckloads, 55,000 pound loads of wheat, because some of the suppliers that actually supply seed
[01:47:27.006 --> 01:47:36.232]  As opposed to the grain suppliers had overbought, the seeding season is done, and they haven't realized yet how dear wheat is.
[01:47:36.232 --> 01:47:44.037]  And we were able to pick up a couple of loads so that the people that are ordering their supplies can get the stuff that is involved with wheat.
[01:47:44.037 --> 01:47:46.659]  But that's the type of thing that's happening.
[01:47:46.659 --> 01:47:50.301]  We have three major suppliers out here in the West.
[01:47:50.301 --> 01:47:53.523]  Every one of them has contacted the JMS Warehouse.
[01:47:54.048 --> 01:47:57.910]  Asking if they can buy wheat back because they can't meet their contract.
[01:47:57.910 --> 01:48:01.913]  Yeah, folks, if you're doubting any of this, just type into Google, food shortage.
[01:48:01.913 --> 01:48:08.716]  You'll get thousands of articles and prices doubling and just insane things that are happening.
[01:48:08.716 --> 01:48:15.280]  So when you say running out of food, what type of foods are, and when will we see this happen?
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:20.023]  Okay, when they start, when they do more to limit the amount of corn going to
[01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:25.633]  Uh, to, uh, uh, farmers that feed their cattle.
[01:48:25.633 --> 01:48:27.874]  Uh, you're gonna start seeing dairy.
[01:48:27.874 --> 01:48:35.258]  We had a price jump, uh, that was huge of dairy where we start, where we almost, uh, took the milk out of the, uh, one-year supply.
[01:48:35.258 --> 01:48:35.818]  No, I know.
[01:48:35.818 --> 01:48:37.839]  Milk at the store, nobody's noticing.
[01:48:37.839 --> 01:48:40.640]  It used to be two and a half dollars, now it's like four and a half.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:43.402]  And at gas stations, it's six and a half dollars.
[01:48:43.402 --> 01:48:43.922]  No, no.
[01:48:43.922 --> 01:48:46.424]  I, I, I paid seven and a half.
[01:48:46.424 --> 01:48:47.144]  At a gas station.
[01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:51.453]  Yeah, but this is not even the beginning yet, okay?
[01:48:51.453 --> 01:48:53.314]  This is just working up to it.
[01:48:53.314 --> 01:48:58.218]  Bottom line is, we're going to start what we're going to start doing.
[01:48:58.218 --> 01:49:07.945]  Folks, what you need to do is you need to get up on, those of you that have computers, get up on eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:49:11.788 --> 01:49:14.250]  It is a smart move with all the uncertainty.

[01:49:16.271 --> 01:49:21.355]  You get such good food that's been dried, packed so it fits in small places.
[01:49:21.355 --> 01:49:25.318]  It is so much more inexpensive than buying it at the store, and the quality is assured.
[01:49:25.318 --> 01:49:27.080]  And then you don't have to worry about it anymore.
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:28.360]  We're not fearful people.
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:29.742]  We're living in power.
[01:49:29.742 --> 01:49:33.364]  We're living in responsibility, taking care of our families.
[01:49:33.364 --> 01:49:34.465]  I believe in this.
[01:49:34.465 --> 01:49:36.327]  This is a great company.

[01:49:44.389 --> 01:49:54.218]  At this point, we're officially stating that eFoods Direct, the J. Michael Stevens Group, is no longer in a position of trying to sell you folks on getting food.

[01:50:20.366 --> 01:50:27.871]  We're going to keep everybody updated as to what's happening, what is in danger, if Rice is in danger, what they need to do.
[01:50:27.871 --> 01:50:28.652]  I understand.
[01:50:28.652 --> 01:50:30.133]  Steve, give them that phone number though.
[01:50:30.133 --> 01:50:30.873]  Give them that phone number.
[01:50:30.873 --> 01:50:31.013]  It's 800-409-5633.

[01:50:41.442 --> 01:50:43.104]  I got one more question on the other side, Steve.
[01:50:43.104 --> 01:50:43.424]  Stay there.
[01:50:51.656 --> 01:50:53.617]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:50:53.617 --> 01:50:57.238]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:50:57.238 --> 01:50:59.699]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:50:59.699 --> 01:51:02.721]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:51:02.721 --> 01:51:08.463]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:51:08.463 --> 01:51:12.365]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:52:51.818 --> 01:52:57.825]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[01:52:57.825 --> 01:53:09.277]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[01:53:09.697 --> 01:53:10.837]  Here's the story.
[01:53:10.837 --> 01:53:18.999]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[01:53:18.999 --> 01:53:20.140]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:21.840]  It's 100% legal.
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:28.262]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.

[01:53:33.083 --> 01:53:37.404]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[01:53:37.404 --> 01:53:38.204]  It's that simple.
[01:53:38.524 --> 01:53:42.166]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[01:53:42.166 --> 01:53:45.448]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[01:53:45.448 --> 01:54:00.918]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[01:54:00.918 --> 01:54:03.160]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:05.101]  Steve Schenck, 27 years in business.
[01:54:06.118 --> 01:54:09.500]  High-quality, dried foods.
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:11.381]  And that means it's stored in very small places.
[01:54:11.381 --> 01:54:15.404]  I held him over because I wanted to give his website again, afoodsdirect.com.
[01:54:15.404 --> 01:54:18.826]  Big banners on the top of InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:54:18.826 --> 01:54:23.509]  And, you know, he's been saying this on the show for a year, and I keep hoping, before you ever heard about food shortages, he was saying it.
[01:54:23.509 --> 01:54:26.731]  And I didn't hear him saying it two years ago on the radio and other shows.
[01:54:27.503 --> 01:54:28.824]  And then now it all starts happening.
[01:54:28.824 --> 01:54:34.989]  I mean, I believed him, but I believe him now, but I just can't believe all this is happening.
[01:54:34.989 --> 01:54:39.052]  And there's a very good chance it's going to be even worse than he's saying.
[01:54:39.052 --> 01:54:43.536]  It's pretty much dead reckoning that it's going to happen like he's saying, or it may not be as bad.
[01:54:43.536 --> 01:54:48.100]  You know, regardless, with the inflation we're facing is the main reason I got into food.
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:52.263]  There's a lot of other reasons, because the dollar's being devalued.
[01:54:53.084 --> 01:54:54.327]  And so food is key.
[01:54:54.327 --> 01:54:55.910]  Water filters are key.
[01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:57.474]  And Steve's got all that, too.
[01:54:57.474 --> 01:55:01.322]  Steve, give them the toll-free number and the website so they can get that article you've written.
[01:55:02.219 --> 01:55:06.984]  Okay, it's 800-409-5633.
[01:55:06.984 --> 01:55:12.328]  On the web, it's efoodsdirect.com, and please sign up for the newsletter.
[01:55:12.328 --> 01:55:23.719]  What we're going to start doing, Alex, is virtually every day we're going to fire out a real quick, just a summary of what's happening, notices, warnings, alerts.
[01:55:23.719 --> 01:55:27.803]  We're going to keep you upgraded as to when things are disappearing, what's happening.
[01:55:28.743 --> 01:55:35.808]  The price increase in May on the 12th is not a ploy.
[01:55:35.808 --> 01:55:40.071]  This is just pure, pure raw economics.
[01:55:40.071 --> 01:55:42.552]  Well, you've always been extremely competitive.
[01:55:42.552 --> 01:55:43.913]  You've always been extremely competitive.
[01:55:43.913 --> 01:55:46.355]  You've been having to raise prices and they're still very low.
[01:55:46.355 --> 01:55:50.297]  Give them the number again, Steve.
[01:55:50.297 --> 01:55:55.881]  It's 800-409-5633 and sign up for the newsletter that we'll fire out to you at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:55:57.019 --> 01:56:03.543]  Get on the website, and we're going to start being an information source, not a marketing source anymore, Alex.
[01:56:03.543 --> 01:56:10.488]  That's right, and it says here, for Money Week on your website, food prices are going to cause mass hunger and civil unrest worldwide.
[01:56:10.488 --> 01:56:11.649]  It's already started.
[01:56:11.649 --> 01:56:16.472]  You said that here a year ago, Steve, and I wish you were wrong, but people better give you a call now.
[01:56:16.472 --> 01:56:17.893]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:56:17.893 --> 01:56:19.293]  Hey, you take care, Alex.
[01:56:19.293 --> 01:56:19.654]  You bet.
[01:56:19.654 --> 01:56:24.757]  He joins us once a month, ladies and gentlemen, and he not only makes this show possible,
[01:56:25.774 --> 01:56:37.083]  Like our other sponsors, it's one of the most important sponsors we have, and it's where I chose to get my food seven years ago, a year ago, two months ago, and I got family that doesn't have money.
[01:56:37.083 --> 01:56:39.585]  I don't go out and buy fancy cars, folks.
[01:56:39.585 --> 01:56:41.726]  I bought family money.
[01:56:41.726 --> 01:56:48.712]  I mean, I bought family food with the money I have, and today I am going to buy... I just talked to Steve.
[01:56:48.712 --> 01:56:52.715]  I'm gonna call and buy more food for family who doesn't have money.
[01:56:54.159 --> 01:57:13.615]  I mean, my grandmother didn't have a lot of savings, and my grandfather was just a lease hound and roughneck in the oil fields, and she had at least some in the bank, but her Social Security check's been cut in half in its value in the last four years of inflation, and she was down to nothing.
[01:57:13.615 --> 01:57:18.379]  And so I've been helping her financially, not that I'm rolling in it, but that's what I do.
[01:57:18.379 --> 01:57:22.042]  And I don't take trips to Bermuda, I'm taking care of my family.
[01:57:22.891 --> 01:57:27.473]  And, uh, if you've got finances out there, folks, you take care of your family.
[01:57:27.473 --> 01:57:28.473]  I'm gonna give her food.
[01:57:28.473 --> 01:57:30.474]  I'm gonna give some other family I have more food.
[01:57:30.474 --> 01:57:36.336]  Uh, my parents who don't really listen, even though they're smart, I think I'm gonna buy them some food.
[01:57:36.336 --> 01:57:37.997]  And, uh, because that's what I do.
[01:57:37.997 --> 01:57:39.558]  I give people water filters.
[01:57:39.558 --> 01:57:41.878]  I tell you don't use cell phones.
[01:57:41.878 --> 01:57:43.419]  It's admitted they're giving you brain tumors.
[01:57:43.419 --> 01:57:45.680]  I mean, all I do is try to warn people.
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:50.702]  It totally freaks me out that I can't stop using a cell phone, though I've cut back by 90 plus percent.
[01:57:51.670 --> 01:57:54.512]  Even when I know it's giving me a brain tumor.
[01:57:54.512 --> 01:57:58.614]  It's just, we're in a total freak land.
[01:57:58.614 --> 01:58:04.958]  And that's all I can say, so... Just totally blows my mind.
[01:58:04.958 --> 01:58:12.383]  Okay, I'm gonna come back and finish up with this global warming fraud, and how they've got the Republicans pushing it now.
[01:58:12.383 --> 01:58:16.925]  And then we're gonna get William Lewis on to talk about Washington, you're fired.
[01:58:16.925 --> 01:58:17.846]  Big agribusiness.
[01:58:18.524 --> 01:58:22.867]  This country can once feed the earth three or four times over, different projections showed.
[01:58:22.867 --> 01:58:27.569]  Now we export most of our food and import 30 plus percent of the food we eat.
[01:58:27.569 --> 01:58:32.872]  It's unbelievable.
[01:58:32.872 --> 01:58:36.575]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:36.575 --> 01:58:41.918]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:41.918 --> 01:58:44.419]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:44.419 --> 01:58:46.160]  A new world order.
[01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:47.101]  In the near future.
[01:58:47.975 --> 01:58:51.038]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:51.038 --> 01:58:53.881]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:53.881 --> 01:58:56.664]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[01:58:56.664 --> 01:58:59.848]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.848 --> 01:59:07.175]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:10.197 --> 01:59:15.641]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.641 --> 01:59:19.504]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:19.504 --> 01:59:22.086]  Dillberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:22.086 --> 01:59:23.227]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.227 --> 01:59:24.027]  They're not after money.
[01:59:24.027 --> 01:59:25.288]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.288 --> 01:59:26.289]  They're after power.
[01:59:26.289 --> 01:59:27.430]  That's what they're after these years.
[01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:31.573]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:59:36.137 --> 01:59:36.898]  In-game.
[01:59:36.898 --> 01:59:38.940]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:44.145]  You have been warned.
[01:59:44.145 --> 01:59:46.547]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.547 --> 01:59:49.310]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:56.306 --> 01:59:58.067]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:58.067 --> 01:59:59.648]  You want answers?
[01:59:59.648 --> 02:00:01.209]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:01.209 --> 02:00:05.391]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.391 --> 02:00:16.497]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.497 --> 02:00:19.779]  We're now into the third hour, fourth hour coming up, Headship.
[02:00:22.463 --> 02:00:23.323]  Fourth hour.
[02:00:23.323 --> 02:00:29.907]  We're going to be joined in the next segment by William Lewis, documentary filmmaker, and very interesting information.
[02:00:29.907 --> 02:00:34.069]  His new film we're carrying, Washington, You're Fired, just out, just came out.
[02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:37.730]  We have it for you right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:00:37.730 --> 02:00:39.791]  And we're working on getting Bob Chapman at the end of the show.
[02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:43.193]  We've got time zones scrambled to pop in with an economic report.
[02:00:44.071 --> 02:00:46.232]  Regardless, I've got the news here in front of me.
[02:00:46.232 --> 02:00:50.894]  We're going to be covering it as the mainstream media now start talking about depression ad nauseam.
[02:00:50.894 --> 02:00:53.135]  First it was a hint here, a comment there.
[02:00:53.135 --> 02:01:02.199]  Now I've got like ten different articles or more today from quote, prestigious publications saying this.
[02:01:02.199 --> 02:01:06.761]  Bush says that we must halt our CO2 emissions.
[02:01:06.761 --> 02:01:11.823]  And again, they picked an inert gas, the life-giving gas that life started with on this planet.
[02:01:11.823 --> 02:01:12.724]  Oxygen came later.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:25.008]  They picked it, and then now by saying it's bad, they can target humanity, tax us, regulate us, have one-child policies, and introduce eugenics to you in the name of anti-humanism.
[02:01:25.008 --> 02:01:31.272]  Anti... I don't mean that in the classical anti-humanism, I mean anti-human life, anti-almost-sapien-sapien.
[02:01:31.272 --> 02:01:34.194]  Now, this is Richard N. Haas, Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:01:34.194 --> 02:01:38.958]  Paul wrote an article a month ago with his mainstream publication saying, humans are the enemy,
[02:01:39.736 --> 02:01:45.698]  This is a false, made-up threat, just like terrorism, and he said they will govern us with it.
[02:01:45.698 --> 02:01:49.440]  So, uh, now here is Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich!
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:55.402]  Total fake, total Trojan horse, always meant to neutralize conservatives, always been his job.
[02:01:55.402 --> 02:01:56.623]  Here he is with Nancy Pelosi.
[02:01:58.908 --> 02:02:03.812]  Hi, I'm Nancy Pelosi, lifelong Democrat and Speaker of the House.
[02:02:03.812 --> 02:02:07.775]  And I'm Newt Gingrich, lifelong Republican and I used to be Speaker.
[02:02:07.775 --> 02:02:10.957]  We don't always see eye to eye, do we Newt?
[02:02:10.957 --> 02:02:15.720]  No, but we do agree our country must take action to address climate change.
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:18.803]  We need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast.
[02:02:18.803 --> 02:02:23.306]  If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.
[02:02:23.306 --> 02:02:25.548]  Go to WeCanSolveIt.org.
[02:02:25.548 --> 02:02:27.029]  Together, we can do this.
[02:02:27.634 --> 02:02:32.559]  So every word is written by a top behavioral psychologist, pitch man or woman.
[02:02:32.559 --> 02:02:47.573]  First off, it puts you back into left-right division by saying they don't agree, but then it says, but we've got to unify around this outside threat, so it's meant to unify you back into believing the government when the government has an 11% approval rating via Congress.
[02:02:47.573 --> 02:02:51.837]  So it's desperate to get you back into the con game for one more trip to the FEMA camp.
[02:02:52.817 --> 02:03:00.001]  Then they say the solution to bring us together is climate change is real, it's man-made, and then he adds, oh, you're for innovating.
[02:03:00.001 --> 02:03:01.142]  Everybody's for innovation.
[02:03:01.142 --> 02:03:06.405]  They had that little notch in there to fool conservatives and think, oh, I'm for innovating.
[02:03:06.405 --> 02:03:09.286]  Newt Gingrich was there to destroy the contract on America.
[02:03:09.286 --> 02:03:11.087]  He was there to fool conservatives.
[02:03:11.087 --> 02:03:14.049]  He was there to muffle a conservative revolution.
[02:03:15.248 --> 02:03:22.698]  When you hear fake neocons on the radio like Bortz or Limbaugh, these dumb liberals, they're stopping us from drilling in ANWR in Alaska.
[02:03:22.698 --> 02:03:27.804]  These dumb liberals, they talk bad about the loving oil companies.
[02:03:27.804 --> 02:03:31.189]  You know, oh, the dumb liberals are keeping us from cheap oil.
[02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:32.170]  OPEC's a cartel.
[02:03:32.170 --> 02:03:33.432]  The oil companies are a cartel.
[02:03:34.275 --> 02:03:35.536]  An oligopoly.
[02:03:35.536 --> 02:03:41.360]  We have their own lawsuit documents where they shut down 214 refineries in their documents.
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:48.606]  They bought them up for sometimes five, ten times what they were worth because people wouldn't sell to just shut them down to create an artificial bottleneck.
[02:03:49.292 --> 02:03:56.033]  It's the oil companies, we've had oil company execs on and others, the documents have come out, to not drill in Alaska because there's too much oil.
[02:03:56.033 --> 02:03:59.934]  They want to artificially keep prices high with artificial scarcity.
[02:03:59.934 --> 02:04:02.495]  Please stop being conned!
[02:04:02.495 --> 02:04:10.776]  The foundations through the Pentagon and others, Carnegie Endowment on Peace, was hired by the Department of War in the 20s to start all this.
[02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:14.897]  They are waging war on you, this is the bankers, they use left-right to control you.
[02:04:16.167 --> 02:04:29.897]  They hire and control the leftist, the focus groups, the non-governmental organizations, as Philip Bobbitt at UT called for, as their fronts to claim they're keeping you from getting oil.
[02:04:29.897 --> 02:04:31.338]  They are manipulating you.
[02:04:31.338 --> 02:04:32.719]  They're lying to you.
[02:04:32.719 --> 02:04:35.602]  Why doesn't Neil Borch tell you it's the bankers doing it?
[02:04:35.602 --> 02:04:41.486]  Why doesn't he tell you that the government, you think a bunch of dirty hippies are keeping you from oil?
[02:04:41.486 --> 02:04:44.328]  They're a bunch of scum owned by the banks!
[02:04:44.328 --> 02:04:45.169]  We'll be right back!
[02:04:49.133 --> 02:04:51.995]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:04:51.995 --> 02:04:53.556]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:04:53.556 --> 02:04:55.697]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:04:55.697 --> 02:04:57.598]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:04:57.598 --> 02:04:59.079]  The late great USA.
[02:04:59.079 --> 02:05:00.860]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:06:51.948 --> 02:06:55.691]  Have you noticed how every type of gadget these days requires some specific type of battery?
[02:06:55.691 --> 02:06:57.692]  It doesn't matter what kind of gadget you're using.
[02:06:57.692 --> 02:06:59.834]  We all take different sizes and types of batteries.
[02:06:59.834 --> 02:07:01.955]  That's where BatteryStation.com comes in.
[02:07:01.955 --> 02:07:03.196]  More like battery heaven.
[02:07:03.196 --> 02:07:04.477]  BatteryStation.com has
[02:07:04.497 --> 02:07:04.777]  I think.
[02:07:26.394 --> 02:07:26.854]  I think so.
[02:07:53.362 --> 02:07:58.183]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:07:58.183 --> 02:07:59.783]  You want answers?
[02:07:59.783 --> 02:08:01.324]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:01.324 --> 02:08:05.525]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:05.525 --> 02:08:09.566]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.616 --> 02:08:24.137]  September the 11th for them was a bad day.
[02:08:24.137 --> 02:08:25.937]  For us, it was a change of attitude.
[02:08:25.937 --> 02:08:32.499]  The Military Commissions Act of 2006 is one of the most important pieces of legislation in the war on terror.
[02:08:32.499 --> 02:08:33.840]  Habeas corpus.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:39.261]  It is the last line of defense against arbitrary executive power.
[02:08:39.261 --> 02:08:45.943]  The framers created a system where we did not have to rely on the good graces or good mood of the president.
[02:08:45.943 --> 02:08:47.244]  Military Commissions Act.
[02:08:47.244 --> 02:08:50.805]  It would perpetuate the indefinite detention of hundreds of individuals
[02:08:51.957 --> 02:09:00.059]  Against whom the government has brought no charges and present no evidence without any recourse to justice whatsoever.
[02:09:00.059 --> 02:09:02.240]  It does violence to the Constitution.
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:10.462]  What the Congress did and what the President signed today essentially revokes over 200 years of American principles and values.
[02:09:10.462 --> 02:09:18.744]  Does this mean that under this law, ultimately the only thing keeping you, I, or the viewer out of Gitmo is the sanity and honesty of the President of the United States?
[02:09:19.611 --> 02:09:20.272]  It does.
[02:09:20.272 --> 02:09:24.234]  The Congress just gave the President despotic powers.
[02:09:24.234 --> 02:09:28.778]  And you could hear the yawn across the country as people turned to, you know, dancing with the stars.
[02:09:28.778 --> 02:09:31.580]  I mean, it's otherworldly.
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:34.142]  The bill I signed today helps secure this country.
[02:09:34.142 --> 02:09:38.005]  This can go on indefinitely, and it's a self-proclaimed emergency.
[02:09:38.005 --> 02:09:39.706]  It's a self-proclaimed emergency.
[02:09:39.706 --> 02:09:45.030]  The point here is you've heard it repeatedly from administration officials, that we cannot predict how long it will go.
[02:09:47.631 --> 02:09:55.034]  On October 17, 2006, President Bush signed into law the Military Commissions Act of 2006.
[02:09:55.034 --> 02:10:09.481]  By doing so, our representatives in Washington have committed the most shocking and openly malevolent act of giving the President of the United States true dictatorial ruling powers, and by stripping Americans of their constitutionally guaranteed right of habeas corpus.
[02:10:11.027 --> 02:10:11.267]  All right.
[02:10:40.279 --> 02:11:05.832]  And I would add, it's always worse than we can even say in films, that it's the president or any of his designates, and I read the headline earlier, law enforcement agencies joined together for anti-terrorism initiative nationwide Sunday, but this is a story out of Memphis, 50 federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies pulled over cars, random checkpoints on streets, looking for drugs, looking for people with warrants, giving tickets,
[02:11:06.636 --> 02:11:08.417]  It said an anti-terror initiative.
[02:11:08.417 --> 02:11:12.880]  See, all crime is terror under Section 802.
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:17.303]  And it said that the FEMA Command Center, Office of Homeland Security Command Center, ran it all.
[02:11:17.303 --> 02:11:18.864]  They have CIA liaisons in them.
[02:11:18.864 --> 02:11:21.306]  They track your cell phones in real time.
[02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:28.310]  And then I talked to some locals in Memphis and they said, yeah, this is martial law takeover drills.
[02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:29.871]  Folks, it isn't our opinion.
[02:11:29.871 --> 02:11:35.295]  In the Military Commissions Act, in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act,
[02:11:36.133 --> 02:11:41.357]  NPDD 51, it states the President, not Congress, no one else, is Supreme Dictator.
[02:11:41.357 --> 02:11:42.818]  It says the governors are nothing.
[02:11:42.818 --> 02:11:46.561]  It says the government is prepared for war with the American people.
[02:11:46.561 --> 02:11:49.383]  It says for insurrection and rebellion.
[02:11:49.383 --> 02:11:52.805]  They're set up to attack us en masse.
[02:11:52.805 --> 02:11:56.228]  This isn't meant for guys with turbans and beards, even if you believe in terror.
[02:11:57.219 --> 02:12:01.302]  This is a widespread attack set up for the mass of everyone.
[02:12:01.302 --> 02:12:04.584]  And now they admit departments are being trained for martial law.
[02:12:04.584 --> 02:12:06.385]  I've got news clip after news clip.
[02:12:06.385 --> 02:12:08.626]  Gun confiscations.
[02:12:08.626 --> 02:12:11.508]  26,000 preachers trained to do this.
[02:12:11.508 --> 02:12:17.872]  Tasering an NFL football player who politely put his hands together and begged the officer not to push him anymore.
[02:12:17.872 --> 02:12:19.253]  Cop just pushing him, pushing him.
[02:12:19.253 --> 02:12:20.394]  It's on Prison Planet.
[02:12:20.394 --> 02:12:22.075]  And the guy just says, please.
[02:12:22.075 --> 02:12:22.995]  And he shoves him.
[02:12:22.995 --> 02:12:23.776]  So he tasers him.
[02:12:24.617 --> 02:12:27.345]  I mean, and the media says it's good and he's bad.
[02:12:27.345 --> 02:12:32.318]  That the person being shoved and then tased for no reason is bad and deserves it.
[02:12:33.607 --> 02:12:35.188]  Folks, that's because the country's gone.
[02:12:35.188 --> 02:12:49.476]  The bankers are now, just like a spider, catches you in the web, say you're a moth, it comes in, injects you with venom that liquefies your insides, and you're still alive though, and then it comes over and drains, sucks you dry.
[02:12:49.476 --> 02:12:57.821]  We've been injected, we've now been dried out, we're just juice inside, it's coming over now, and it's insanguinating us, sucking every drop.
[02:12:57.821 --> 02:13:02.084]  It just started the sucking, and I am just sick of it.
[02:13:04.068 --> 02:13:05.449]  I mean, that is what's happening.
[02:13:05.449 --> 02:13:07.511]  It's gone.
[02:13:07.511 --> 02:13:10.633]  We are in red-level crisis.
[02:13:10.633 --> 02:13:13.696]  They're increasing the drugs and toxins they put in the water.
[02:13:13.696 --> 02:13:15.697]  They're increasing the spraying.
[02:13:15.697 --> 02:13:19.900]  They're increasing by five times the mercury in the shots associated press.
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:22.583]  They are attacking us, and their minions don't even know.
[02:13:22.583 --> 02:13:25.865]  They're just compartmentalized fools.
[02:13:25.865 --> 02:13:29.348]  Red-level emergency, and we need to get this new film.
[02:13:30.473 --> 02:13:31.534]  Washington, you're fired.
[02:13:31.534 --> 02:13:34.718]  I believe it's the next American Freedom to Fascism.
[02:13:34.718 --> 02:13:38.263]  You know, Aaron did a great job of that film, dying of cancer while he was making it.
[02:13:38.263 --> 02:13:39.784]  He was hospitalized while he was making it.
[02:13:39.784 --> 02:13:41.667]  He never made a big deal out of it.
[02:13:41.667 --> 02:13:45.611]  But this is even more slickly done and has more info and it's wider spectrum.
[02:13:46.612 --> 02:13:50.516]  The film's staying together, but I think it's the next Freedom to Fascism, and I think you need to get it.
[02:13:50.516 --> 02:13:54.379]  We sell it at InfoWars.com, and I want everybody to get it.
[02:13:54.379 --> 02:13:56.380]  This just came out last week.
[02:13:56.380 --> 02:13:59.323]  InfoWars.com, Washington, you're fired, or 888-253-3139.
[02:13:59.323 --> 02:14:03.486]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:14:13.644 --> 02:14:21.229]  We've got to burn the midnight oil, get ten times more aggressive, hand out more DVDs, make copies of all my films, I want you to.
[02:14:21.229 --> 02:14:22.750]  Get them out to everybody.
[02:14:22.750 --> 02:14:25.973]  Get aggressive now or it's over.
[02:14:25.973 --> 02:14:32.077]  Let everybody see Endgame so they know how they're running biological, chemical, radiological attacks on us.
[02:14:32.077 --> 02:14:34.058]  These are eugenicists.
[02:14:34.058 --> 02:14:40.403]  Remember just last year the head of the human genome at the Cold Springs Harbor lab said blacks basically aren't human?
[02:14:41.354 --> 02:14:48.199]  He was the guy running eugenics there when it was the eugenics records office when he was 20-something years old.
[02:14:48.199 --> 02:14:51.402]  Now he's almost 80 and was still running it last year.
[02:14:51.402 --> 02:14:54.044]  The human genome is the eugenicist.
[02:14:54.044 --> 02:14:55.145]  They run it.
[02:14:55.145 --> 02:14:56.286]  They're not the Nazis.
[02:14:56.286 --> 02:14:59.268]  They created the Nazis.
[02:14:59.268 --> 02:15:02.551]  This is an emergency situation.
[02:15:02.551 --> 02:15:06.193]  I'm risking my life to tell you this.
[02:15:06.193 --> 02:15:09.336]  I want to see thousands of these DVDs go out now.
[02:15:11.289 --> 02:15:12.329]  Washington, you're fired.
[02:15:12.329 --> 02:15:13.530]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:13.530 --> 02:15:20.192]  I remember William Lewis when he made a police state audio thing, I guess back in 99, 98.
[02:15:20.192 --> 02:15:27.115]  He wanted to work with me, come to work here, and I just was by myself with one little office with two employees and said, man, I can't pay you.
[02:15:27.768 --> 02:15:29.730]  Well, Alex, it is an honor to be on the program with you.
[02:15:29.730 --> 02:15:30.831]  I've waited a long time to do this.
[02:15:30.831 --> 02:15:32.512]  I've been listening to you for 10 years now, and I've got to tell you,
[02:15:57.935 --> 02:16:02.258]  You know, you are the inspiration for me getting into this business.
[02:16:02.258 --> 02:16:05.381]  I knew I wanted to make films, I just didn't know what I wanted to make them about.
[02:16:05.381 --> 02:16:08.623]  And I remember the first thing you made was an audio CD with tracks of me ranting.
[02:16:08.623 --> 02:16:11.065]  It's excellent.
[02:16:11.065 --> 02:16:17.850]  Well, you know, those were back in the days when I still believed that I could get music out on the internet fairly easy.
[02:16:17.850 --> 02:16:19.271]  It's just not as easy as you think.
[02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:20.412]  Video is the way to go, man.
[02:16:21.556 --> 02:16:22.736]  People will sit down and watch it.
[02:16:22.736 --> 02:16:25.017]  No, no, we need to promote a fictional book.
[02:16:25.017 --> 02:16:26.377]  That'll save us.
[02:16:26.377 --> 02:16:27.638]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:16:27.638 --> 02:16:29.398]  Yeah, film is the way to go.
[02:16:29.398 --> 02:16:30.778]  The best weapon in the arsenal.
[02:16:30.778 --> 02:16:32.319]  Tell us about this movie.
[02:16:32.319 --> 02:16:34.019]  Several years in the making.
[02:16:34.019 --> 02:16:37.460]  I mean, the slick cover, slick production, great interviews.
[02:16:37.460 --> 02:16:44.282]  I mean, this thing is a real creme de la creme, cream of the cream that you've done, William.
[02:16:44.282 --> 02:16:45.362]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:16:45.362 --> 02:16:48.443]  This is a very low-budget production.
[02:16:49.858 --> 02:16:54.280]  I think people are going to be absolutely astounded at what they see in this.
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:17:02.965]  We took a lot of time to do, you know, the graphics and the animation and everything that you see on the screen that kind of tries to tie all this together.
[02:17:02.965 --> 02:17:09.288]  Because I believe that, you know, the visuals is just as important as the music and what you're saying.
[02:17:09.288 --> 02:17:12.490]  So, yeah, about two years in the works.
[02:17:12.490 --> 02:17:15.551]  Research for this thing, much more than that though, I've got to say.
[02:17:15.551 --> 02:17:18.253]  You know, we've been researching this now for about at least seven or eight years.
[02:17:19.573 --> 02:17:37.443]  This is a culmination of all of the bad legislation that's been passed by 435 members of your representatives that are supposed to represent the United States of America and the people, and they obviously simply don't.
[02:17:39.266 --> 02:17:42.829]  This is our attempt to tie all that together and show people exactly what's going on.
[02:17:42.829 --> 02:17:46.673]  As they say, connect the dots, so do we.
[02:17:46.673 --> 02:17:55.081]  We're going to connect the dots in this documentary and show people exactly what rights you've lost, bill by bill, as they accumulate.
[02:17:55.081 --> 02:18:00.447]  Well, I'm just so honored that I woke you up, or was the one that
[02:18:01.488 --> 02:18:03.829]  To use the enemy's analogy, bitch ya!
[02:18:03.829 --> 02:18:08.551]  And I've given so many the liberty bug thanks to God's guidance.
[02:18:08.551 --> 02:18:15.153]  And now you've given so many the spirit of liberty and freedom as we transfer this to others.
[02:18:15.153 --> 02:18:19.715]  I think the globalists are going wild right now because they are scared to know we're coming for them.
[02:18:19.715 --> 02:18:21.875]  And I think that just accelerates people's awakening.
[02:18:21.875 --> 02:18:28.938]  I mean, it's getting nuts now where the cops for no reason push a black guy who's putting his hands together praying to them
[02:18:30.016 --> 02:18:52.562]  And then they taser him, and the media says the black guy's bad, or a guy didn't have his ID in the library, so they say, give us your ID, he says, I don't have one, so he gets on his knees and says, please don't taser me, and they taser him, and that's the video, or the guy with his hands up saying, please don't tase me, bro, and they still tase, or they tase you on the metro in Canada now, if you don't pay for your ticket.
[02:18:52.562 --> 02:18:56.643]  I mean, they're torturers, they're criminals, I mean, it's all falling apart!
[02:18:57.466 --> 02:18:59.068]  We just need a national ID card.
[02:18:59.068 --> 02:19:01.530]  That would simplify everything, and that way everyone could carry it.
[02:19:01.530 --> 02:19:03.332]  It'd be mandatory, and no one would get in trouble.
[02:19:03.332 --> 02:19:05.334]  Right?
[02:19:05.334 --> 02:19:06.455]  That's what they're thinking.
[02:19:06.455 --> 02:19:08.457]  That's the mentality behind this.
[02:19:08.457 --> 02:19:10.919]  I mean, you know, that's how they're going to use this information against us.
[02:19:10.919 --> 02:19:12.401]  I mean, it's great that we're getting it out.
[02:19:12.401 --> 02:19:13.802]  We have to tell people what's going on.
[02:19:13.802 --> 02:19:14.663]  But you know their story.
[02:19:14.663 --> 02:19:15.484]  You know their spin.
[02:19:15.484 --> 02:19:19.788]  The way they're going to spin this is if we had a national ID card, those guys wouldn't have got taped.
[02:19:19.788 --> 02:19:21.970]  Or if you had a chip under your skin, those guys wouldn't have got taped.
[02:19:23.849 --> 02:19:24.810]  It's unbelievable.
[02:19:24.810 --> 02:19:26.331]  Stay there, my friend.
[02:19:26.331 --> 02:19:30.254]  We're going to come back and we're going to continue to play some clips.
[02:19:30.254 --> 02:19:36.839]  The video links are up on Infowars.com to watch clips of the videos for yourself.
[02:19:36.839 --> 02:19:38.000]  William Lewis is our guest.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.122]  The new film is Washington, You're Fired.
[02:19:40.122 --> 02:19:43.345]  The Declaration of Independence tells us it's our right and duty to do that.
[02:19:43.345 --> 02:19:44.105]  You understand?
[02:19:44.105 --> 02:19:45.747]  We're the boss of you, government.
[02:19:45.747 --> 02:19:49.530]  You don't rule us, you dirty crooks!
[02:19:49.530 --> 02:19:50.831]  It is a big idea
[02:19:51.966 --> 02:19:53.727]  A New World Order.
[02:19:53.727 --> 02:19:58.629]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:58.629 --> 02:20:01.451]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:20:01.451 --> 02:20:04.252]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:20:04.252 --> 02:20:07.434]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:07.434 --> 02:20:14.758]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:17.788 --> 02:20:23.234]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:20:23.234 --> 02:20:26.537]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:20:26.537 --> 02:20:29.660]  The Oval Bureau is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:29.660 --> 02:20:30.821]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:30.821 --> 02:20:31.622]  They're not after money.
[02:20:31.622 --> 02:20:32.883]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:32.883 --> 02:20:33.884]  They're after power.
[02:20:33.884 --> 02:20:35.025]  That's what they're after.

[02:20:46.544 --> 02:20:47.707]  You have been warned.
[02:20:49.881 --> 02:20:55.948]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[02:20:55.948 --> 02:21:01.894]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[02:21:01.894 --> 02:21:06.059]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[02:21:06.059 --> 02:21:10.964]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[02:21:11.204 --> 02:21:19.711]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[02:21:48.678 --> 02:22:01.827]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:22:01.827 --> 02:22:12.895]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:22:12.895 --> 02:22:15.236]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose
[02:22:16.297 --> 02:22:18.038]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:22:18.038 --> 02:22:24.182]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:22:39.813 --> 02:22:42.434]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[02:22:42.434 --> 02:22:48.416]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:22:48.416 --> 02:22:54.257]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:22:54.257 --> 02:22:59.339]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:22:59.679 --> 02:23:05.065]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:23:05.065 --> 02:23:10.971]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:23:10.971 --> 02:23:17.198]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[02:23:17.198 --> 02:23:20.702]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:23:20.982 --> 02:23:25.784]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:23:25.784 --> 02:23:26.844]  Do your part.
[02:23:26.844 --> 02:23:29.465]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[02:23:29.465 --> 02:23:38.669]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[02:23:45.131 --> 02:23:46.532]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:59.503]  In every case in history, the same thing happens.
[02:23:59.503 --> 02:24:02.544]  They always wear black cloaks.
[02:24:02.544 --> 02:24:03.725]  It's an archetypal image.
[02:24:03.725 --> 02:24:06.747]  Why do you think George Lucas chose it for Darth Vader?
[02:24:06.747 --> 02:24:07.628]  They always come.
[02:24:07.628 --> 02:24:09.149]  They always rape your women.
[02:24:09.149 --> 02:24:12.711]  They always burn your cities and put you in big camps.
[02:24:12.711 --> 02:24:13.872]  It's because it's what they do.
[02:24:15.467 --> 02:24:17.248]  That's what psychopaths do.
[02:24:17.248 --> 02:24:20.190]  They always declare themselves God.
[02:24:20.190 --> 02:24:22.671]  They always spy on you.
[02:24:22.671 --> 02:24:24.472]  They always take everything you got.
[02:24:24.472 --> 02:24:27.914]  99 times out of 100.
[02:24:27.914 --> 02:24:30.715]  Liberty is unbelievably rare and unknown.
[02:24:30.715 --> 02:24:34.538]  Squalor and serfdom and enslavement is the norm.
[02:24:34.538 --> 02:24:37.299]  America, America, the great has fallen.
[02:24:37.299 --> 02:24:42.422]  Can we resurrect her or will the enemies overthrow everything that's left and have their ways with you?
[02:24:44.437 --> 02:24:47.519]  Going back to William Lewis, the new film.
[02:24:47.519 --> 02:24:48.219]  You're fired.
[02:24:48.219 --> 02:24:50.021]  Washington, you're fired.
[02:24:50.021 --> 02:24:53.623]  It's up on InfoWars.com if you want to get it right now.
[02:24:53.623 --> 02:24:56.044]  Play some more audio clips from the film in the next segment.
[02:24:56.044 --> 02:25:02.088]  William, when did you decide to make this film and break down, I mean this is really an amazing film, break down what they learned.
[02:25:02.088 --> 02:25:03.829]  I love it because it's wide spectrum.
[02:25:03.829 --> 02:25:09.953]  It gives you a big picture of how this is serious, hardcore tyranny.
[02:25:09.953 --> 02:25:12.715]  Well, we started shooting this about two and a half years ago.
[02:25:13.468 --> 02:25:28.653]  It covers several of the events that were going on in Washington over the 9-1-1 celebration, whatever you want to call it, you know, the big events that they were having, Democracy Now!, and all those people, demonstrations.
[02:25:28.653 --> 02:25:30.674]  Everybody's out on the street.
[02:25:30.674 --> 02:25:37.457]  All you have to do is walk up to someone and say, hey, we're making a documentary about the government, you know, really in Washington.
[02:25:37.457 --> 02:25:38.417]  That's all you have to say.
[02:25:38.417 --> 02:25:41.378]  And you've got somebody shooting off 10 things that they're
[02:25:42.170 --> 02:25:43.030]  Yeah, he's huge.
[02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:45.251]  He's Keith Olbermann's favorite.
[02:26:10.172 --> 02:26:11.613]  Well, he's my favorite, too.
[02:26:11.613 --> 02:26:15.335]  I mean, he says the right things, and he said all the right things for this documentary.
[02:26:15.335 --> 02:26:15.935]  I guarantee it.
[02:26:15.935 --> 02:26:17.656]  The man knows what he's talking about.
[02:26:17.656 --> 02:26:24.259]  He cries out continually against the Bush administration these laws that have been passed, and he gives you the constitutional reason.
[02:26:24.259 --> 02:26:34.445]  You know, he tells you exactly why this is wrong, and this is why it was so great to have him be a part of this and be able to go to Washington and shoot a documentary with Jonathan Turley.
[02:26:38.046 --> 02:26:48.371]  One of my dreams, just like some of the other ones, where we got Jim Mars or Joan Vion, these people I've been following for 10 years now.
[02:26:48.371 --> 02:26:56.494]  And now I'm actually getting to work with some of these people.
[02:26:56.494 --> 02:27:01.076]  Just the value of having those people in your documentary, because they're so
[02:27:02.060 --> 02:27:10.625]  Well-known and so articulate in the way they explain that your rights are being taken away and you're watching it happen right underneath your nose.
[02:27:10.625 --> 02:27:12.166]  Now, what are we going to do about it?
[02:27:12.166 --> 02:27:18.289]  And instead of talking yourself blue in the face, trying to talk to your friends, family, neighbors, say, hey, this is a pretty wild movie.
[02:27:18.289 --> 02:27:19.750]  Tell me what you think.
[02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:28.295]  And 90% of the time, you've just unlocked a mind that the government has spent from cradle to wherever they're at in their life, hundreds of thousands of dollars in propaganda apiece
[02:27:29.035 --> 02:27:30.076]  I love the way you descriptively
[02:27:51.906 --> 02:27:52.907]  Show people those things.
[02:27:52.907 --> 02:27:56.088]  I guess in radio, you kind of have to paint a picture for everyone.
[02:27:56.088 --> 02:28:05.654]  Fortunately, for video, we can just show them what we want them to see, and I think you're going to find that in Washington, you're fired.
[02:28:05.654 --> 02:28:08.955]  Unlike, I guess, the other four that I've worked on.
[02:28:08.955 --> 02:28:16.179]  Maybe Beyond Treason is an exception, but there's no conspiracy theory in this.
[02:28:16.179 --> 02:28:18.901]  It is simply a matter of fact that this is the bill.
[02:28:19.648 --> 02:28:20.969]  Here's the people who signed it.
[02:28:20.969 --> 02:28:21.749]  Here's the Democrats.
[02:28:21.749 --> 02:28:22.609]  Here's the Republicans.
[02:28:22.609 --> 02:28:25.470]  You'll notice that it's about the same number of each.
[02:28:25.470 --> 02:28:26.871]  And here's what the bill does to you.
[02:28:26.871 --> 02:28:29.152]  This is how it affects your rights.
[02:28:29.152 --> 02:28:39.596]  And, of course, at the end of each one of these little segments that we do on the particular legislation, we like to give out ways that people can combat these things.
[02:28:39.596 --> 02:28:43.218]  B-O-R-D-C dot org is a great website.
[02:28:44.682 --> 02:28:57.536]  Bill of Rights Defense Committee, they actually help organize groups and individuals around the country to be able to enact legislation in your community that says the Patriot Act is not valid here.
[02:28:57.536 --> 02:29:03.523]  I don't know if your audience is aware of this or not, but there's like about 450 resolutions that have passed.
[02:29:05.122 --> 02:29:17.450]  By the way, I'm not bragging, but William, did you know that I came up with that idea six months before and said we should form groups and have cities and counties and states pledge not to do this?
[02:29:17.450 --> 02:29:19.592]  I don't doubt it, but now it's happening.
[02:29:19.592 --> 02:29:25.896]  My point is that that's the power of just ideas, and the listeners here carried the ball.
[02:29:25.896 --> 02:29:30.439]  Austin was one of the first cities to do it, and it's something I'm very, very proud of.
[02:29:30.439 --> 02:29:31.660]  It is one of my accomplishments.
[02:29:32.643 --> 02:29:36.690]  I put out a battle plan, people picked up on it, improved on it, and it happened.
[02:29:36.690 --> 02:29:39.254]  Stay there.
[02:29:39.254 --> 02:29:40.636]  We're on the march.
[02:29:40.636 --> 02:29:43.180]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:45.864]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:49.562 --> 02:29:51.542]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:29:51.542 --> 02:29:58.504]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:29:58.504 --> 02:30:06.906]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:30:06.906 --> 02:30:12.627]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:30:13.027 --> 02:30:14.648]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:30:14.648 --> 02:30:16.949]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:30:16.949 --> 02:30:21.350]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:30:21.350 --> 02:30:23.571]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:30:23.571 --> 02:30:31.354]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:32:50.362 --> 02:32:59.805]  In April of 2007, Representative Jane Harman introduced one of the most terrifying bills ever to make its way onto the House floor.
[02:32:59.805 --> 02:33:12.368]  The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and seeks to add provisions pertaining to the prevention of homegrown terrorism.
[02:33:13.786 --> 02:33:22.893]  The bill's focal point is centered on terrorism by individuals born, raised, or based and operating primarily in the United States.
[02:33:22.893 --> 02:33:24.154]  H.R.
[02:33:24.154 --> 02:33:30.058]  1955 specifically targets the civilian population of the United States and makes having certain thoughts a crime.
[02:33:35.140 --> 02:33:46.891]  This bill makes it a crime for the people of the United States to have certain thoughts floating around in their head that may be contrary to the conventional wisdom of the current administration.
[02:33:46.891 --> 02:33:48.532]  Are you a terrorist?
[02:33:48.532 --> 02:33:50.654]  You just might be.
[02:33:50.654 --> 02:33:59.242]  As defined in the bill, homegrown terrorism is a term meaning the use, planned use, or threatened use of force or violence by a group or individual.
[02:34:00.976 --> 02:34:10.283]  I think we can all agree that preventing violence is a good thing, but the red flag being waved in front of our faces actually comes from the use of the word force.
[02:34:10.283 --> 02:34:29.297]  According to the American Heritage Dictionary, the word force is defined as the capacity to do work or cause physical change, intellectual power or vigor, especially as conveyed in writing or speech, a capacity for affecting, influencing, or persuading the mind or behavior,
[02:34:31.058 --> 02:34:36.080]  Here's where you really begin to understand what the bill is attempting to regulate.
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:42.682]  Let's read the bill's intended uses and substitute the word force with the actual definitions.
[02:34:42.682 --> 02:34:52.166]  Homegrown terrorism is a term meaning the use, planned use, or threatened use of intellectual power or vigor, especially as conveyed in writing or speech.
[02:34:53.795 --> 02:35:03.580]  Homegrown terrorism is a term meaning the use, planned use, or threatened use of persuading the mind or behavior of another person.
[02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:14.505]  According to the bill, you might be a terrorist if you use or plan to use your powers of persuasion to change someone else's mind, either through writing or through speech.
[02:35:14.505 --> 02:35:15.525]  Can anyone say 19 freaking 84?
[02:35:17.984 --> 02:35:24.928]  This bill makes anyone into a terrorist for simply aspiring to affect political, religious, or social change.
[02:35:24.928 --> 02:35:36.134]  Anyone attempting to think, teach, or promote concepts that challenge conventional thinking or popular wisdom would be labeled and dealt with as criminals.
[02:35:36.134 --> 02:35:41.397]  My question for our legislators is who gets to decide what's a thought crime?
[02:35:41.397 --> 02:35:45.079]  Will the definition of thought crimes change from administration to administration?
[02:35:46.533 --> 02:35:55.039]  Will the people of this country be sentenced to death or merely imprisoned for questioning the conduct of their leaders in Washington?
[02:35:55.039 --> 02:36:05.246]  If signed into law, this piece of legislation will single-handedly strip Americans of the most essential birthright that we have, the freedom of conscious thought.
[02:36:05.246 --> 02:36:10.030]  The very foundation upon which our First Amendment is grounded is being uprooted at the core.
[02:36:11.355 --> 02:36:22.686]  HR 1955 sets the stage for the outlawing of protests of any kind in the United States and seeks to criminalize the very conception of thought itself.
[02:36:22.686 --> 02:36:33.216]  Any piece of legislation that seeks to invade and regulate the thoughts of the people of the United States needs to be booted out the front door of the Capitol building along with the person who introduced it.
[02:36:34.873 --> 02:36:43.218]  If you agree that your brain belongs to you, please join us in contacting the House of Representatives and voicing your opinion.
[02:36:43.218 --> 02:36:46.861]  Go to www.house.gov.
[02:36:46.861 --> 02:36:50.403]  Just enter your zip code and click go to find your representative.
[02:36:51.508 --> 02:36:53.710]  Make sure to tell them that you oppose H.R.
[02:36:53.710 --> 02:36:55.452]  1955.
[02:36:55.452 --> 02:37:06.101]  And the next time you see representative... I mean, it's an amazing film, not just incredible video work or police beating up peaceful protesters or all these experts they've got or the corruption in Washington.
[02:37:06.101 --> 02:37:09.364]  It really gives people a wide spectrum understanding what's happening.
[02:37:09.364 --> 02:37:10.305]  Washington, you're fired.
[02:37:10.305 --> 02:37:13.107]  Available right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:37:13.107 --> 02:37:13.247]  Now...
[02:37:14.088 --> 02:37:16.052]  He'll be with us for this segment and the next.
[02:37:16.052 --> 02:37:19.059]  And then for the full fourth hour, William Lewis will be with us.
[02:37:19.059 --> 02:37:23.368]  He's going to ride shotgun right now and talk to Bob Chapman with us.
[02:37:24.335 --> 02:37:27.778]  We've got Bob on with all the financial things that are happening.
[02:37:27.778 --> 02:37:29.319]  That's another form of tyranny.
[02:37:29.319 --> 02:37:43.572]  It's important to give you analysis from an expert who's had one of the biggest, if not the biggest, financial newsletters out there, an amazing forecaster, worked in military intelligence, then in almost every level of finance, and in brokerage, and gold and silver, you name it.
[02:37:43.572 --> 02:37:51.959]  Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com, who predicted three years ago we'd see $1,000 an ounce gold, and we've now seen it.
[02:37:52.634 --> 02:37:56.317]  And he's predicting it'll go above 2,000 in the next few years.
[02:37:56.317 --> 02:37:57.758]  Here's the headlines I've got.
[02:37:57.758 --> 02:37:59.699]  William Lewis, pop in any time.
[02:37:59.699 --> 02:38:01.961]  Filmmaker William Lewis with your comments.
[02:38:01.961 --> 02:38:05.344]  Authorities lose patience with collapsing dollar.
[02:38:05.344 --> 02:38:14.691]  London Telegraph, Jean-Claude Juncker, who is calling for Washington to take steps to halt the slide of the dollar, is saying that Washington by design is destroying it.
[02:38:15.612 --> 02:38:20.756]  And saying that they've got to move to prop it up or it may completely implode, causing a worldwide depression.
[02:38:20.756 --> 02:38:21.897]  London Telegraph.
[02:38:21.897 --> 02:38:22.478]  Reuters.
[02:38:22.478 --> 02:38:25.020]  Experts see depression parallels in U.S.
[02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:25.961]  crisis.
[02:38:25.961 --> 02:38:31.205]  Big article from Reuters and their financial reporter saying that they see a depression in the U.S.
[02:38:31.205 --> 02:38:32.867]  That's Reuters.
[02:38:32.867 --> 02:38:33.587]  Here's Reuters.
[02:38:33.587 --> 02:38:35.869]  Gold bounces back to market.
[02:38:35.869 --> 02:38:37.331]  $9.50 plus in futures.
[02:38:37.331 --> 02:38:37.511]  $9.50 today.
[02:38:39.512 --> 02:38:45.594]  Financial collapse will end the Iraq occupation, but it won't come at a time of Washington's choosing.
[02:38:45.594 --> 02:38:47.434]  That ties into it as well.
[02:38:47.434 --> 02:38:51.115]  Bob Chapman, a lot has developed since you were on with us last Friday.
[02:38:51.115 --> 02:38:53.256]  What do you see happening?
[02:38:53.256 --> 02:39:03.678]  Well, Jade Claude Juncker is the president of Luxembourg, and as you know, it's a very small country.
[02:39:03.678 --> 02:39:05.339]  He's also the chairman of the
[02:39:06.711 --> 02:39:11.054]  financial board with the G7.
[02:39:11.054 --> 02:39:18.219]  And I don't know that what he has to say carries a terrific amount of weight.
[02:39:18.219 --> 02:39:34.371]  But that said, look, they all know that the other currencies have to go down against the dollar because of the tremendous problems that are involved, a lot of which, or criminally incited, and a lot of which
[02:39:35.163 --> 02:39:36.964]  ...are the result of the U.S.
[02:39:36.964 --> 02:39:40.706]  being the local motive of the world for so many years.
[02:39:40.706 --> 02:39:42.827]  And, you know, these people don't appreciate that.
[02:39:42.827 --> 02:39:46.129]  It's like, what have you done for me lately?
[02:39:46.129 --> 02:40:03.819]  And, you know, my question, and I was just writing something about that, and my question is, Mr. Juncker, how about the manipulation of the markets already by the central banks?
[02:40:04.429 --> 02:40:06.351]  Why don't you talk about that?
[02:40:06.351 --> 02:40:10.334]  He's talking about coming in and shoring up the dollar.
[02:40:10.334 --> 02:40:11.916]  Let me tell you something.
[02:40:11.916 --> 02:40:15.979]  That's a $3.2 trillion a day market.
[02:40:15.979 --> 02:40:19.402]  They might be able to affect it for two or three days.
[02:40:19.402 --> 02:40:20.944]  End of story.
[02:40:20.944 --> 02:40:23.866]  So, it's hollow.
[02:40:23.866 --> 02:40:28.991]  What is behind this is they wanted to rally the stock market.
[02:40:28.991 --> 02:40:29.831]  And that they did.
[02:40:29.831 --> 02:40:31.493]  They've done it over the last several days.
[02:40:32.351 --> 02:40:39.054]  I'm sure all of the Illuminists pitched in and did their part, and they want the market up high.
[02:40:39.054 --> 02:40:39.654]  You know why?
[02:40:39.654 --> 02:40:41.235]  Because it's going to go back down again!
[02:40:41.235 --> 02:40:41.815]  That's why!
[02:40:41.815 --> 02:40:44.636]  Because the news is dreadful!
[02:40:44.636 --> 02:40:50.799]  And so, you see these little pieces come out, which are really propaganda.
[02:40:50.799 --> 02:40:57.702]  Look, the euro has been undervalued versus the dollar for years.
[02:40:57.702 --> 02:41:01.003]  And now you take into consideration the problems that the dollar has,
[02:41:02.799 --> 02:41:05.001]  The Euro should go higher.
[02:41:05.001 --> 02:41:08.484]  And the reason they don't want it to is they can't make as much money.
[02:41:08.484 --> 02:41:16.671]  And if they step in and try to hold the dollar at these levels, they're going to buy lots of dollars that are depreciating.
[02:41:16.671 --> 02:41:19.994]  And so, this guy is whistling in the wind.
[02:41:19.994 --> 02:41:23.517]  And nothing is going to change the underlying problems.
[02:41:23.517 --> 02:41:29.261]  And yes, the Europeans are making noises, but they have to.
[02:41:29.261 --> 02:41:31.003]  Because they're all politicians.
[02:41:32.137 --> 02:41:40.444]  And they're getting all kinds of questions from manufacturers that are saying, oh my goodness, we're going to have a 160 euro, how can I make any money?
[02:41:40.444 --> 02:41:43.226]  And so they've got to come out with something.
[02:41:43.226 --> 02:41:50.692]  Well that's it, it's more of acting like they're trying to stop this slide, but fundamentally, enough of the establishment wants the slide that it's continuing.
[02:41:50.692 --> 02:41:59.538]  I mean, how is, why is that happening A, and then B, Bob Chapman, I want William to comment on this, why are they allowing it to happen, but then B,
[02:42:00.639 --> 02:42:06.401]  What will it look like from your intelligence background and financial background and your incredible skills at forecasting?
[02:42:06.401 --> 02:42:17.886]  I mean, that's really why you're important, is because you have forecasted for decades accurately at about a 95%, which is better than most people that I know of, even at the highest levels of forecasting.
[02:42:17.886 --> 02:42:19.526]  What will it look like in the U.S.
[02:42:19.526 --> 02:42:21.587]  if we go into a hyper-depression?
[02:42:21.587 --> 02:42:25.809]  I mean, what do you forecast people are going to behave like?
[02:42:25.809 --> 02:42:28.930]  Probably, at some point in time, like a bunch of wild animals.
[02:42:29.858 --> 02:42:32.720]  And, you know, the world lives on its stomach.
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:35.762]  And it also has to have a house or an apartment to live in.
[02:42:35.762 --> 02:42:48.491]  And we get all these people getting thrown out of their apartments and houses because they can't pay their rent or their mortgage, and the price of energy products and food are going up astronomically.
[02:42:48.491 --> 02:42:52.734]  And so there's going to be a lot of people out of work.
[02:42:52.734 --> 02:42:53.114]  The U.S.
[02:42:53.114 --> 02:42:55.336]  economy is going to tank.
[02:42:55.336 --> 02:42:57.517]  And I think part of this whole thing is
[02:42:59.253 --> 02:43:06.254]  And this is a guesstimate, and I'm trying to think of what Brzezinski's thinking.
[02:43:06.254 --> 02:43:15.376]  And I think what they're trying to do here is, I think they realize they made an awful lot of money with globalization and free trade.
[02:43:15.376 --> 02:43:17.717]  They gained an awful lot of control.
[02:43:17.717 --> 02:43:20.117]  But it's gone out of control.
[02:43:20.117 --> 02:43:23.238]  And I think they want to bring it to an end.
[02:43:23.238 --> 02:43:28.799]  And I think this is one of the ways to do it, by bringing the dollar down, and then eventually putting on tariffs.
[02:43:29.261 --> 02:43:37.327]  And the sidestep there, that's why MI6 and the CIA are sticking it to the Chinese in Tibet.
[02:43:37.327 --> 02:43:41.330]  That operation was set up in 1948, and it's been going ever since.
[02:43:42.736 --> 02:43:44.177]  See, Bob, I have a problem.
[02:43:44.177 --> 02:43:49.879]  I don't like the CIA, but I really don't like the Communist Chinese, which our government helped put in power.
[02:43:49.879 --> 02:43:50.999]  So that was kind of a duel.
[02:43:50.999 --> 02:43:53.880]  The globalists always do duel ops, as you know.
[02:43:53.880 --> 02:43:56.621]  The CIA and 49 back Mao, that's now declassified.
[02:43:56.621 --> 02:44:00.002]  But they also have the Tibetans as a counterbalance.
[02:44:00.002 --> 02:44:01.723]  And I like the side of the Tibetans.
[02:44:01.723 --> 02:44:03.804]  I like the side, you know, against the Communists.
[02:44:04.344 --> 02:44:06.946]  I've lived in both Switzerland and in Sweden, and I'm neutral.
[02:44:06.946 --> 02:44:11.168]  They're doing this to China to put them off balance because they want to show them
[02:44:33.223 --> 02:44:39.145]  That if you guys go out and kick out those dollars into the market, you're going to have a war in your hands.
[02:44:39.145 --> 02:44:47.409]  They've also got Pakistan and India hating China, and that's why they helped give them all nukes.
[02:44:47.409 --> 02:44:48.669]  Let me get a comment from William Lewis.
[02:44:48.669 --> 02:44:51.110]  That all goes together there like a mosaic.
[02:44:51.110 --> 02:44:56.072]  Let me get a comment from William Lewis, filmmaker, the new film available at InfoWars.com.
[02:44:56.072 --> 02:44:57.173]  Washington, you're fired.
[02:44:57.173 --> 02:45:00.554]  William, your take on financial warfare and what we see happening right now.
[02:45:01.953 --> 02:45:23.194]  Well, you know, the most obvious reason that you'd want to bring around a depression is because if you've got everyone out there scrambling to put food on the table and to keep a house over their head, you know, you're not necessarily concerned about who's being elected president or rights that are being taken away or any of the other really important things that are going on in this country.
[02:45:23.194 --> 02:45:25.116]  You're a little bit more concerned with just staying alive.
[02:45:25.885 --> 02:45:27.046]  I think that's the intention.
[02:45:44.528 --> 02:45:46.009]  And I was told about this by locals.
[02:45:46.009 --> 02:45:48.409]  The cops have been told they're getting ready for martial law.
[02:45:48.409 --> 02:45:49.170]  Then you read it.
[02:45:49.170 --> 02:45:50.290]  Nighttime curfews.
[02:45:50.290 --> 02:45:51.591]  Arresting people.
[02:45:51.591 --> 02:45:52.351]  Checkpoints.
[02:45:52.351 --> 02:45:54.432]  Randomly shaking everyone down.
[02:45:54.432 --> 02:45:57.733]  Hundreds of arrests for not having insurance or whatever.
[02:45:57.733 --> 02:46:07.517]  I mean, this is feds with military running around in Memphis and they're calling it anti-terror and then randomly... I mean, this is a martial law takeover drill.
[02:46:07.517 --> 02:46:08.517]  They admit it.
[02:46:08.517 --> 02:46:10.618]  I mean, this is... And they're doing this all over the country, Bob.
[02:46:11.972 --> 02:46:21.100]  I know that for some time, and all I can say is, and I don't like to say this, they better get ready to get dead because that's what's going to happen.
[02:46:21.100 --> 02:46:24.043]  The American people are not going to lay down for this.
[02:46:24.043 --> 02:46:28.807]  There's 450 million weapons in this country, and people know how to use them.
[02:46:28.807 --> 02:46:33.671]  And if the mercenaries and the military and the police think they're going to stop them, they're crazy!
[02:46:34.755 --> 02:46:36.536]  They're going to get dead real fast.
[02:46:36.536 --> 02:46:38.958]  Well, if 1%... There will be no color of law.
[02:46:38.958 --> 02:46:45.882]  Well, if 1% of 150 million gun owners fights back, that's 1,500,000 combatants.
[02:46:45.882 --> 02:46:47.523]  And 1% is going to fight.
[02:46:47.523 --> 02:46:50.405]  And I feel sorry for the cops, because this is part of the globalist plan, Bob.
[02:46:50.405 --> 02:46:51.886]  They're locked.
[02:46:51.886 --> 02:46:54.287]  That's a terrible situation to be in.
[02:46:54.287 --> 02:47:00.351]  And what they should do is speak out and say, no, I'm not going to do that.
[02:47:00.351 --> 02:47:01.872]  I just can't believe it's coming to this.
[02:47:01.872 --> 02:47:03.893]  It might be the story of the Chief of Police of Hamburg.
[02:47:04.540 --> 02:47:17.665]  When Adolf Hitler took over in 1933, he called him into his office in Berlin, and he said, and I don't know his name, but anyway, he said to him, look, you're a wonderful policeman, and I know you hate me, but we need law and order in Hamburg.
[02:47:17.665 --> 02:47:19.045]  Would you go and do that?
[02:47:19.045 --> 02:47:20.826]  And he says, yes, I will.
[02:47:20.826 --> 02:47:26.428]  At the end of the war, when they had him at the war crimes trial, he said, all I did was follow the law.
[02:47:26.428 --> 02:47:28.949]  You can't use that as an excuse.
[02:47:30.154 --> 02:47:36.200]  By the way, Arnold Schwarzenegger got confronted by We Are Change today, and they brought up that he wears a Nazi belt buckle on TV.
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:39.843]  His dad was the head of an entire... His dad was the equivalent of a colonel.
[02:47:39.843 --> 02:47:41.845]  A captain in the SS is a colonel.
[02:47:41.845 --> 02:47:44.748]  Because they only have one general, and that was Heinrich Himmler.
[02:47:44.748 --> 02:47:46.449]  It's a secret police model.
[02:47:46.449 --> 02:47:52.775]  His dad ran an entire county, an entire city of Graz, admittedly arresting tens of thousands of political dissidents to their death.
[02:47:53.456 --> 02:47:59.178]  And this piece of trash is now the governor of one of our states and is calling for a police state.
[02:47:59.178 --> 02:48:04.080]  I mean, the humiliation this country has to put up with, Bob.
[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:04.860]  It's incredible.
[02:48:04.860 --> 02:48:08.622]  And look at the three dolts that we have running for president.
[02:48:08.622 --> 02:48:15.444]  Of course, Ron Paul, you know, may make it if Mr. McCain has a heart attack or something.
[02:48:15.444 --> 02:48:17.405]  But, you know, those three people are awful.
[02:48:20.580 --> 02:48:23.584]  Yeah, I have no idea how it ever got to this point.
[02:48:23.584 --> 02:48:28.471]  William Lewis, do you ever feel like you're living in a nightmare?
[02:48:28.471 --> 02:48:31.335]  For the past 10 years, man.
[02:48:31.335 --> 02:48:35.080]  Yeah, I mean, this is just the tip of the iceberg of the stuff that we're talking about today.
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:36.302]  There's so much accumulated
[02:48:37.592 --> 02:48:49.556]  You know, the problems that we're talking about now, a lot of them started decades and decades ago, and we're just now seeing their evil plan blossoming.
[02:48:49.556 --> 02:48:53.877]  Maybe we didn't understand what was going on at the time, but I think we've got a pretty good idea of it right now.
[02:48:54.935 --> 02:48:57.096]  You know, this is the time to do something, people.
[02:48:57.096 --> 02:49:01.158]  This is the time to pick up that video weapon that you have and start showing it to people.
[02:49:01.158 --> 02:49:02.258]  Bob, here's another story.
[02:49:02.258 --> 02:49:08.241]  A well-known Palestinian activist, no criminal record, local school teacher had been arrested and they tried to frame him.
[02:49:08.241 --> 02:49:09.982]  He was suing the FBI.
[02:49:09.982 --> 02:49:15.785]  He was found hands, feet, mouth, gagged, bound, dead in the river in Austin.
[02:49:15.785 --> 02:49:20.067]  And the FBI went and fished him out and said, oh, he committed suicide today in Austin.
[02:49:21.141 --> 02:49:25.343]  Well, that just goes to show you that you can't trust the FBI.
[02:49:25.343 --> 02:49:29.365]  And if they come to your house, you know what to do.
[02:49:29.365 --> 02:49:34.668]  You know, one of the other programs I was on the other night, uh, you know, Reverend Butch Pa?
[02:49:34.668 --> 02:49:35.548]  Yes.
[02:49:35.548 --> 02:49:37.009]  He's on your network.
[02:49:37.009 --> 02:49:39.550]  And I've been on with Butch for over ten years.
[02:49:39.550 --> 02:49:45.433]  And he said the Secret Service was in there threatening him this week.
[02:49:45.433 --> 02:49:47.554]  The only reason they don't threaten me is they can't find me.
[02:49:50.598 --> 02:49:54.321]  Yeah, it's just amazing.
[02:49:54.321 --> 02:49:57.063]  You know, I've been at this 49 years.
[02:49:57.063 --> 02:50:02.948]  And, you know, we were kind of like the four cavalieros.
[02:50:02.948 --> 02:50:09.614]  G. Edward Griffith, Alan Stang, Gary Allen, and I. And I've been at this a long time.
[02:50:09.614 --> 02:50:17.500]  And, of course, it's Allen and Ed and I who were left, but it's been a long, long fight.
[02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:19.422]  I'm referring to what this other gentleman said.
[02:50:22.441 --> 02:50:22.982]  Absolutely.
[02:50:22.982 --> 02:50:26.544]  Final segment with Bob Chapman, then we'll have a full hour with William Lewis.
[02:50:26.544 --> 02:50:33.530]  We're going to talk more about where he sees gold going, briefly with him, in the next week, next month or so.
[02:50:33.530 --> 02:50:35.411]  Then we'll shift gears and get back into the film.
[02:50:35.411 --> 02:50:36.352]  Washington, you're fired.
[02:50:36.352 --> 02:50:49.663]  We're going to play some video clips of it, William's been kind enough, down the computer feed for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers when we start the fourth hour at InfoWars.com in eight minutes.
[02:50:49.663 --> 02:50:51.004]  It is a big idea
[02:50:52.119 --> 02:50:53.880]  A New World Order.
[02:50:53.880 --> 02:50:58.784]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:58.784 --> 02:51:01.606]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:01.606 --> 02:51:04.408]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:51:04.408 --> 02:51:07.590]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:14.916]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:17.938 --> 02:51:23.382]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:23.382 --> 02:51:27.244]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:27.244 --> 02:51:29.806]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:51:29.806 --> 02:51:30.987]  Most people have no idea.
[02:51:30.987 --> 02:51:31.767]  They're not after money.
[02:51:31.767 --> 02:51:33.048]  They have all the money they need.
[02:51:33.048 --> 02:51:34.029]  They're after power.
[02:51:34.029 --> 02:51:35.330]  That's what they're after these years.
[02:51:35.330 --> 02:51:39.913]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:51:39.913 --> 02:51:43.895]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:43.895 --> 02:51:46.697]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:51:46.697 --> 02:51:47.738]  You have been warned.
[02:51:48.899 --> 02:51:49.779]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:51:49.779 --> 02:51:55.903]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[02:51:55.903 --> 02:52:02.407]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[02:52:02.407 --> 02:52:06.309]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[02:52:06.309 --> 02:52:09.471]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[02:52:10.191 --> 02:52:14.174]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[02:52:14.174 --> 02:52:19.399]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[02:52:19.399 --> 02:52:22.041]  We will still have two regrets.
[02:52:22.041 --> 02:52:26.044]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[02:52:26.044 --> 02:52:29.727]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[02:52:29.727 --> 02:52:36.552]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[02:52:37.333 --> 02:52:38.774]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633
[02:52:48.928 --> 02:52:50.209]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[02:52:50.209 --> 02:52:52.630]  of the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:52:52.630 --> 02:52:55.672]  Allicin, natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:52:55.672 --> 02:52:56.412]  is a real thing.
[02:52:56.412 --> 02:53:03.417]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer from fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:53:03.417 --> 02:53:14.443]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[02:53:14.443 --> 02:53:17.605]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies
[02:53:17.765 --> 02:53:18.025]  I think so.
[02:53:53.180 --> 02:53:53.342]  Yeah!
[02:54:15.794 --> 02:54:17.215]  Look, this is the final segment.
[02:54:17.215 --> 02:54:20.037]  I gotta get Bob Chapman up early next week.
[02:54:20.037 --> 02:54:21.858]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:54:21.858 --> 02:54:24.420]  We're gonna final comment from him in just a moment.

[02:55:09.599 --> 02:55:14.524]  Dulse, kelp, barley grass, wheatgrass, coralina, spirulina, all in there.
[02:55:14.524 --> 02:55:17.767]  20-plus power-packed ingredients at Interfood.com.
[02:55:17.767 --> 02:55:21.931]  Also, there is aloes from the folks at New Vitality.
[02:55:21.931 --> 02:55:23.853]  We are so proud to have these fine sponsors.
[02:55:23.853 --> 02:55:24.314]  Hundreds
[02:55:24.754 --> 02:55:25.294]  And hundreds.
[02:55:25.294 --> 02:55:27.335]  They're one of the biggest vitamin companies out there.
[02:55:27.335 --> 02:55:31.296]  Of the well-known, well-documented products like aloes.
[02:55:31.296 --> 02:55:32.217]  Just so much, folks.

[02:55:37.979 --> 02:55:38.759]  And then in closing,
[02:55:47.674 --> 02:55:48.555]  With Bob Chapman.
[02:55:48.555 --> 02:55:51.997]  Bob, we've only got about a minute left, and I want to get you back up next week early.
[02:55:51.997 --> 02:55:55.620]  Let's set you up Monday or Tuesday if we can, because there's so much happening.
[02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:57.402]  Where do you see gold going?
[02:55:57.402 --> 02:56:00.764]  They're trying to hold it down with every trick in the book, but it's not working.
[02:56:00.764 --> 02:56:03.406]  Where do you see it going in the short term?
[02:56:03.406 --> 02:56:10.011]  Well, I think we'll go up and test the old highs between now and the fall, maybe soon.
[02:56:10.011 --> 02:56:13.874]  And they'll be challenging, and they'll go through there.
[02:56:13.874 --> 02:56:16.336]  And sooner or later, the central banks are going to run out of gold.
[02:56:17.268 --> 02:56:18.369]  It's just as simple as that.
[02:56:18.369 --> 02:56:27.814]  Production continues to fall, especially now that the mines in total in South Africa are operating at about 80 to 70 percent.
[02:56:27.814 --> 02:56:32.217]  And so, you know, they're fighting a losing battle.
[02:56:32.217 --> 02:56:35.258]  It's all retrograde, and we just have to be patient.
[02:56:35.258 --> 02:56:39.321]  You go in there, and you make your buy, and you stay in for the duration.
[02:56:39.321 --> 02:56:43.563]  And every time you see a big correction, see if you can get some money and go and buy.
[02:56:44.941 --> 02:56:47.843]  Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:56:47.843 --> 02:56:52.285]  The electronic version goes out a couple times a week.
[02:56:52.285 --> 02:56:58.508]  The paper version, quite thick and excellent on a wide range of issues, goes out twice a month.
[02:56:58.508 --> 02:57:00.609]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:57:00.609 --> 02:57:02.350]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[02:57:02.350 --> 02:57:02.950]  Thank you.
[02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:03.490]  Bye-bye.
[02:57:03.490 --> 02:57:04.491]  Talk to you soon, Bob.
[02:57:04.491 --> 02:57:08.233]  We'll come back with William Lewis when this hour ends, but I wanted to let listeners know
[02:57:09.261 --> 02:57:11.242]  Gold went up again today.
[02:57:11.242 --> 02:57:16.164]  Ted is saying this is probably the last day you'll be able to get the price from two weeks ago.
[02:57:16.164 --> 02:57:23.767]  Throughout the weekend and the next week, if it continues to rise, he will not be able to give you back when it was $9.20, now up at $9.45, $9.50, back and forth all day.
[02:57:23.767 --> 02:57:24.907]  Fifth ounce, Franks, $205 an ounce.
[02:57:24.907 --> 02:57:26.728]  Fifth ounce, Franks, $205 an ounce.
[02:57:26.728 --> 02:57:27.388]  A fifth of an ounce.
[02:57:27.388 --> 02:57:28.249]  British Sovereigns, quarter ounce, $257.
[02:57:39.275 --> 02:57:41.676]  They've still got some rolls of silver dollars they got in.
[02:57:41.676 --> 02:57:43.017]  Ask about that price.
[02:57:43.017 --> 02:57:43.717]  It's really good.
[02:57:43.717 --> 02:57:45.658]  I've got this in single coin price.
[02:57:45.658 --> 02:57:46.978]  I don't have a calculator.
[02:57:46.978 --> 02:57:48.139]  But I know it's a good price.
[02:57:48.139 --> 02:57:48.979]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:57:48.979 --> 02:57:53.361]  Now the price has already gone up.
[02:57:53.361 --> 02:57:55.842]  Unless you tell them it's an Alex Jones, Ted Anderson special.
[02:57:55.842 --> 02:57:56.402]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:57:56.402 --> 02:57:58.423]  The brokers are waiting there right now.
[02:58:01.983 --> 02:58:03.563]  To take your orders.
[02:58:03.563 --> 02:58:08.344]  If you give them a call or to answer your questions, tell them it's the Alex Jones Special, the 5 oz.
[02:58:08.344 --> 02:58:10.365]  European Franks, the ¼ oz.
[02:58:10.365 --> 02:58:11.765]  British Sovereigns.
[02:58:11.765 --> 02:58:12.745]  Very good deal.
[02:58:12.745 --> 02:58:13.405]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:58:13.405 --> 02:58:19.946]  The number again, 800-686-2237.
[02:58:19.946 --> 02:58:22.127]  Fourth hour of overdrive.

[02:58:41.294 --> 02:58:44.915]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:44.915 --> 02:58:47.256]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:47.256 --> 02:58:50.417]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:50.417 --> 02:58:56.138]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
