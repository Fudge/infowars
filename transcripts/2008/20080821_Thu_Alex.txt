[00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.692]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:08.453]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.453 --> 00:00:10.215]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:11.797]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:13.739]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:17.543]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.543 --> 00:00:21.608]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:38.719]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.980]  Feels like Friday for me because I won't be here tomorrow.
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.323]  Jason Bermas is going to be sitting in as I gear up to go to Denver.
[00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:47.426]  Live reports all throughout next week with Jason Bermas sitting in.
[00:00:47.426 --> 00:00:53.270]  We got Mark Dice with his second edition of the Resilience Manifesto coming on.
[00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.151]  He'll be talking about that.
[00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:57.033]  He also has a new book on dating out.
[00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:00.156]  Professor Francis A. Boyle on a really serious subject.
[00:01:01.514 --> 00:01:03.675]  ...dealing with the anthrax attacks.
[00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:11.398]  He's been writing and exposing about the fact that it was an inside job, since shortly after it happened, and he's a bioweapons expert, helped write U.S.
[00:01:11.398 --> 00:01:18.421]  treaties, and of course worked for several White Houses, so he'll be coming on with us in two hours.
[00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:21.302]  Actually, that's in three hours, so we have a fourth hour now.
[00:01:21.302 --> 00:01:24.964]  The last six months or so, I'm just now getting used to it.
[00:01:24.964 --> 00:01:30.226]  But he'll be with us in the fourth hour, Professor Francis A. Broyle, today.
[00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:37.825]  In the first two hours, we are going to have wide open phones.
[00:01:37.825 --> 00:02:00.517]  Sure, I've got a lot of important economic news, a ton of the growing bizarre Orwellville news, I have a lot of military news, I have White House news as they get more and more and more trouble, finally, at least the beginnings of what could bring them into some type of justice, for their criminal activities dealing with creating fake
[00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:07.402]  Documents associating Iraq with Al-Qaeda.
[00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:10.205]  So we'll be talking about that today as well.
[00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:14.289]  But I want to take a lot of your phone calls.
[00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:18.073]  Any issue, any subject, any discussion you would like to have.
[00:02:18.073 --> 00:02:23.138]  If you have a question, a comment, or a point you'd like to make, or a particular news item.
[00:02:23.138 --> 00:02:25.300]  You ever watch the Washington Journal on C-SPAN?
[00:02:27.056 --> 00:02:28.477]  Of course, the hosts aren't like me.
[00:02:28.477 --> 00:02:29.257]  They hardly talk.
[00:02:29.257 --> 00:02:33.099]  They just sit there and listen to you for a minute or so and then hang up on you.
[00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:42.003]  Maybe that's the only way for us to take a lot of calls on this show is for me to just sit there and say nothing and go, thank you, caller.
[00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:47.065]  Maybe I'll... I don't think I can do that because the callers are going to ask me questions and I'm going to want to elaborate.
[00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:50.627]  I'm going to try to keep my answers down to 30 seconds.
[00:02:50.627 --> 00:02:51.567]  How's that sound?
[00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:52.668]  Short answer.
[00:02:52.668 --> 00:02:52.948]  Theater.
[00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:55.109]  Here, we'll see what happens.
[00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:55.570]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.730]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.153]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:03:07.407 --> 00:03:18.009]  Of course, our vaunted websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv, as well as InfoWars.net and JonesReport.com.
[00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:35.113]  I was on Tom Martino's radio show until 40 after today, and then raced from my house over to the studio, and they took like, I don't know, four or five phone calls while I was on, and every caller agreed, including a police officer that called in and others, about government-sponsored terror.
[00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.083]  And how they're federalizing the police, and how the shadow government is basically eating the rest of the country.
[00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:46.828]  So I just wanted to briefly break down continuity of government, why the New World Order likes it, why they're setting it up.
[00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:54.867]  And we will break that down on the other side of this quick break and then go to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:54.867 --> 00:04:02.010]  And I really have been getting better and better at actually taking the calls and going to them quickly.
[00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.310]  I'd say five, six an hour when I'm taking them.
[00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.971]  That's not very quick, is it?
[00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:09.752]  So I'm going to try to... I've done it a few times successfully.
[00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:11.192]  We'll see if one of those is those days.
[00:04:11.192 --> 00:04:12.633]  I know we always get unlimited phone calls.
[00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:14.373]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:14.373 --> 00:04:26.620]  You know, I even have my own phone system here in my own office, and if I open it up and give the number out once, you can open it for 5 seconds, and 20 phone calls will come in.
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.721]  Or more.
[00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:32.943]  We've opened it for like 30 seconds before, and had like 30, 40 overwhelming the system.
[00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.751]  We only have five phone lines, actually six, at Genesis.
[00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:38.812]  So 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:45.837]  And what you can do is, when you hear somebody hang up, that's your chance to dial in real fast.
[00:04:45.837 --> 00:04:48.459]  But by taking more of your calls, it gives us a chance to actually get to them all.
[00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:53.242]  In fact, I'm just going to come to your calls right when we get back, and I'll get the Continuum Government at the bottom of the hour.
[00:04:53.242 --> 00:04:53.962]  Stay with us.
[00:04:53.962 --> 00:05:01.567]  May I have everybody's attention?
[00:05:06.861 --> 00:05:08.382]  It was an inside job!
[00:05:08.382 --> 00:05:09.523]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:05:09.523 --> 00:05:11.225]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:14.127]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:05:14.127 --> 00:05:19.872]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the C.A.R.?
[00:05:19.872 --> 00:05:27.419]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.343]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.744]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:45.906]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:05:45.906 --> 00:05:52.233]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:52.974]  Truth Rising.
[00:05:52.974 --> 00:05:55.797]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:05:55.797 --> 00:05:58.079]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.562]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:06:02.475 --> 00:06:09.939]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:13.962]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[00:06:13.962 --> 00:06:16.163]  Food costs continue to double because there's no
[00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:20.939]  I think?
[00:06:39.728 --> 00:06:47.212]  EFoodsDirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of superfood at half the cost of last year's groceries.
[00:06:47.212 --> 00:06:49.733]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:55.476]  The rest of the world is starving, but what happens in your piece of America is up to you.
[00:06:55.476 --> 00:06:55.756]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:01.118 --> 00:07:04.621]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:07:04.621 --> 00:07:10.025]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:07:10.025 --> 00:07:15.189]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:26.318]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:07:26.698 --> 00:07:32.484]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:07:32.484 --> 00:07:38.751]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:39.792]  What about you?
[00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.714]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[00:07:41.714 --> 00:07:43.896]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[00:07:46.218 --> 00:07:49.520]  Call the Berkey Guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.505]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:08.854]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.854 --> 00:08:11.816]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:09:13.602 --> 00:09:31.902]  Yeah, we're going into Denver!
[00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:48.728]  And I think this cheesy song goes well as our anthem for this mission.
[00:09:48.728 --> 00:09:51.650]  Smokey and the Bandit was for the last Bilderberg.
[00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:35.769]  James in New York, Mark in Florida, Bill, Ian.
[00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:38.209]  Who's that last one there?
[00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:39.310]  Raphael and others.
[00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:44.611]  We're going to be going to your phone calls throughout the broadcast today.
[00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:48.292]  There is a lot of important news and information and two big guests coming up today.
[00:10:48.292 --> 00:10:50.252]  Actually three.
[00:10:50.252 --> 00:10:52.633]  But at least for the next hour and a half I want to take a lot of your phone calls.
[00:10:52.633 --> 00:10:53.873]  At the bottom of the hour I'll briefly
[00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:55.897]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:10:55.897 --> 00:10:59.019]  Hey, I was wondering if I could just share a very quick, easy, and effective tool in the info war with your listeners.
[00:10:59.019 --> 00:10:59.219]  Sure.
[00:10:59.219 --> 00:10:59.719]  Here's what I do.
[00:11:22.324 --> 00:11:43.253]  If you're not the type of person who's into confrontations and videotaping and all that stuff, I have recently gone out and purchased Sidewalk Chalk, a very simple tool, and in the middle of the night I write little messages on my very busy street, parallel to the driver's side of everybody's car, so that when they wake up in the morning and have to drive to work, they're greeted by a little message saying, well, what happened to Building 7?
[00:11:44.353 --> 00:11:50.357]  Uh, what is Operation Northwoods, MKUltra, and so... And I'll tell you why this is such a good idea.
[00:11:50.357 --> 00:11:51.158]  It's such genius.
[00:11:51.158 --> 00:11:53.459]  A lot of people are doing it all over the world.
[00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:58.282]  You know, they do it with chalk in the Hawaiian Islands by, you know, famous waterfalls.
[00:11:58.282 --> 00:12:00.944]  And it's only there for a day or so, but thousands see it.
[00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:06.351]  I mean, it's happening in Peru, it's happening in Australia, it's happening in Texas.
[00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:11.733]  The reason sidewalk chalk is great, it doesn't damage anything, and it's novel.
[00:12:11.733 --> 00:12:17.515]  And people tend to notice it and pay attention to it, but no one can say that it's vandalism.
[00:12:17.515 --> 00:12:23.016]  Although probably if people start really doing it, say that it's Al-Qaeda or something and say it's the death penalty.
[00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:24.917]  But yeah, fabulous idea, continue.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.360]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.162]  And the neighborhood that I live in is pretty busy.
[00:12:29.162 --> 00:12:32.544]  And I know that, you know, we have the regulars that leave in the morning for their commute.
[00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:35.687]  And chances are, they're going to be sitting in front of the computer for a number of hours.
[00:12:35.687 --> 00:12:41.590]  So if they're greeted by a shocking message first thing in the morning, there's a pretty good chance they're going to take that to work.
[00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:46.013]  And, you know, perhaps Google WTC7 or something like that.
[00:12:46.013 --> 00:12:50.436]  I put up their Google TerraStorm, you know, Operation MKUltra, blah, blah.
[00:12:52.372 --> 00:12:54.374]  Yeah, I hope it's having an effect.
[00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:55.855]  It stays there for a couple of days.
[00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:56.816]  The rain washes it away.
[00:12:56.816 --> 00:13:01.179]  No one can accuse me of, like you said, vandalism or, you know, attempt to destroy any property.
[00:13:01.179 --> 00:13:05.763]  It comes and goes and, you know, there are some nights people wake up... Al-Qaedaism!
[00:13:05.763 --> 00:13:07.364]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:13:07.364 --> 00:13:08.325]  And one last thing.
[00:13:08.325 --> 00:13:17.493]  You know, I thank you, Alex, and I thank all of you listeners and everybody else, because sometimes, you know, things appear to be out of our control and they appear to be hopeless.
[00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:31.739]  But my mom, who is in her mid-fifties recently, woke up to all this stuff after seven-plus years of throwing it back in my face about how, oh, it can never be, you know, 9-11 can never be an inside job, I could never believe my own government, blah, blah.
[00:13:31.739 --> 00:13:38.781]  So it takes many, many years in cases, but there are success stories, and it feels good every time it works, so keep up the good work.
[00:13:38.781 --> 00:13:40.942]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[00:13:40.942 --> 00:13:41.902]  James, great point.
[00:13:41.902 --> 00:13:47.644]  Yeah, what would happen if just the millions of listeners to this show
[00:13:49.855 --> 00:13:51.556]  Millions.
[00:13:51.556 --> 00:14:05.161]  If you went to the local toy store, or to Slave Mart, or the police state Target stores, and you marched in there, and you bought one of those little $3 boxes of whatever they cost.
[00:14:05.161 --> 00:14:07.162]  I buy them for my children a couple bucks.
[00:14:07.162 --> 00:14:08.442]  A whole box of chalk.
[00:14:08.442 --> 00:14:13.864]  Red chalk, blue chalk, green chalk, pink chalk, white chalk.
[00:14:13.864 --> 00:14:16.205]  And in walking your dog,
[00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:25.060]  You could literally, at the park or at the corner, just lean down and people say, what are you doing?
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.020]  Oh, it's sidewalk chalk.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.841]  I'm drawing pictures for people.
[00:14:29.841 --> 00:14:31.742]  And it's really a great idea.
[00:14:31.742 --> 00:14:34.322]  Now, I've never consciously thought of doing that.
[00:14:34.322 --> 00:14:35.702]  That is, thought of telling listeners to do it.
[00:14:35.702 --> 00:14:40.223]  I just keep seeing sidewalk chalk pop up in Austin with political messages.
[00:14:40.223 --> 00:14:41.644]  I see it all over the web.
[00:14:41.644 --> 00:14:42.744]  People take photos of it.
[00:14:44.418 --> 00:14:46.739]  And yes, it's very, very, very effective.
[00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:47.899]  Good job, James.
[00:14:47.899 --> 00:14:50.040]  Mark in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.060]  Yeah, good morning, Alex.
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.460]  How are you doing this morning?
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.121]  Good.
[00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:56.461]  I'm actually in Florence, in Oregon.
[00:14:56.461 --> 00:14:57.302]  Okay, well, I'm sorry.
[00:14:57.302 --> 00:14:58.422]  They told me in Florida.
[00:14:58.422 --> 00:14:59.042]  That's all right.
[00:14:59.042 --> 00:15:00.942]  I'm not talking that clear this time of day.
[00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:05.044]  I just didn't get enough sleep last night to quite do that as well as I could.
[00:15:05.044 --> 00:15:10.045]  But anyway, Alex, I just had about two things I wanted to mention real quick to you.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.201]  I have to spend that money first.
[00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:17.686]  I mean, I've got the office, I'm trying to hire people, I'm trying to buy cameras and hook them up and build a studio.
[00:15:28.042 --> 00:15:35.229]  Uh, and so I'm just trying to get that first mission done instead of just piling up, uh, you know, some money.
[00:15:35.229 --> 00:15:39.874]  Now, now, now, now that money's all for the TV show and for the, and for the new office and things.
[00:15:39.874 --> 00:15:41.195]  Cause we could have done it without you listeners.
[00:15:41.195 --> 00:15:46.160]  Uh, I do have some other projects and, and if it looks like we start running out of that money.
[00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:49.371]  I've already spent about $60,000 of it.
[00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:51.072]  Then I will ask for more.
[00:15:51.072 --> 00:15:54.495]  But I do need... But see, that money's all earmarked for that mission.
[00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:57.917]  I do need people to keep buying the books and videos and materials.
[00:15:57.917 --> 00:16:05.963]  Not just because it supports us, but because it gets the word out, like fabled enemies, that you can now pre-order that'll be shipping in just 10 days now.
[00:16:07.584 --> 00:16:10.385]  At InfoWars.com, Jason Burmese's new film.
[00:16:10.385 --> 00:16:14.927]  But yes, we will probably, in the future, do a Money Bomb.
[00:16:14.927 --> 00:16:15.968]  That's great.
[00:16:15.968 --> 00:16:28.914]  Alex, on George Norris' show Coast to Coast, of which you're well familiar, of course, about a year ago, maybe a little longer, he had a guest on, a fellow named Stuart Sverdlo.
[00:16:28.914 --> 00:16:30.895]  It's a Russian name, an ethnic Russian name.
[00:16:30.895 --> 00:16:32.135]  It's S-V-E-D.
[00:16:34.725 --> 00:16:37.628]  Or E-R-D-L-O-W, I believe, or something like that.
[00:16:37.628 --> 00:16:39.550]  Okay, so it's Sverdlo.
[00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:43.473]  Sverdlo, and I was wondering if you had heard of Project Bluebeam.
[00:16:43.473 --> 00:16:45.455]  Has anybody mentioned that, or if you found that interesting?
[00:16:45.455 --> 00:16:53.443]  Yes, I have heard of your secret government programs, and they are real, to create fake flying saucer phenomenon, and I happened to be driving home last night,
[00:16:54.392 --> 00:16:55.153]  No, we're good.
[00:17:08.064 --> 00:17:18.153]  Folks, you can fool people and show, yes, there are government programs declassified to project Jesus with holograms, Buddha, Muhammad.
[00:17:18.153 --> 00:17:20.255]  That was all declassified in 1994.
[00:17:20.255 --> 00:17:26.941]  I remember seeing it in, of all places, I think Popular Mechanics.
[00:17:26.941 --> 00:17:29.644]  Yeah, they call them laser holograms.
[00:17:29.644 --> 00:17:33.287]  The laser facet of that technology of holographic imaging.
[00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:51.865]  I believe that it would be basically transmitted or projected through a satellite as a means of amplification in order to create a really large holographic image in the sky that could be seen by perhaps millions of people or even, you know, one half of the world, perhaps.
[00:17:51.865 --> 00:17:53.807]  Well, that's right, and the Phoenix Lights are clearly
[00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:57.869]  Just some amateurs with holographic, smaller lasers.
[00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.310]  I mean, you can see those are holograms.
[00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:06.554]  And then we've had this thing three football fields long, drifting over Denton, north of Dallas.
[00:18:06.554 --> 00:18:07.895]  And I mean, I have family that saw it.
[00:18:07.895 --> 00:18:09.936]  Gigantic flying saucer.
[00:18:09.936 --> 00:18:14.098]  But I've talked to a lot of folks before that happened who've seen the giant blimp.
[00:18:14.847 --> 00:18:15.728]  And that's really what it is.
[00:18:15.728 --> 00:18:16.889]  It's like some big blimp.
[00:18:16.889 --> 00:18:19.351]  They lower down and shine some lights on.
[00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:22.073]  And I've talked to people that have looked at it, and they say it looks fake.
[00:18:22.073 --> 00:18:25.516]  It doesn't really look... it moves around like a blimp.
[00:18:25.516 --> 00:18:27.458]  And I'm not saying there aren't aliens, folks.
[00:18:27.458 --> 00:18:28.799]  I just don't get into it.
[00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:34.304]  We know there's government programs for fake UFOs and Jesus and everything else.
[00:18:34.304 --> 00:18:38.928]  And it's part of... it's a project, and the Russians have talked about this.
[00:18:38.928 --> 00:18:42.070]  In fact, what was it, about four years ago, they had a
[00:18:43.254 --> 00:18:46.277]  Annual, I have to watch online some of it.
[00:18:46.277 --> 00:18:48.218]  They've been having it every year for a long time.
[00:18:48.218 --> 00:19:01.469]  Since Shoemaker-Levy, when they saw that plunge into Saturn, that giant comet, and then that once and for all proved that giant objects don't hit every million years, they're hitting every couple hundred years.
[00:19:01.469 --> 00:19:12.318]  Just like what hit a hundred years ago in Siberia that destroyed thousands of square miles was some type of asteroid or comet that blew up, vaporized,
[00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:19.028]  And so basically the same effect as a nuclear weapon with an airburst type phenomenon.
[00:19:19.028 --> 00:19:28.491]  And so they started having global conferences and they said publicly that it was the Global UN Conference in Russia.
[00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:30.492]  Whatever year it was, it was in Russia now.
[00:19:30.492 --> 00:19:36.694]  And it was proposed that yes, this could unify us for world government in the name of shooting down asteroids.
[00:19:37.498 --> 00:19:39.160]  Anything that's an outside threat.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.081]  They said, well, aliens is even better.
[00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:43.564]  So you're absolutely right, and I appreciate your call.
[00:19:43.564 --> 00:19:49.930]  That is certainly being looked at, and they're certainly with the Pope coming out and saying aliens are real, and everybody else saying it's real.
[00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.251]  Something is going on.
[00:19:51.251 --> 00:19:55.515]  They're getting people ready for something, and we'll cover it.
[00:19:55.515 --> 00:19:56.876]  You know, the little green men land.
[00:19:56.876 --> 00:19:58.117]  They're probably just androids.
[00:19:58.117 --> 00:19:58.958]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.218 --> 00:20:07.960]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.601]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:10.601 --> 00:20:12.161]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:12.161 --> 00:20:12.962]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:13.882]  This is his M.O.
[00:20:13.882 --> 00:20:15.322]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:15.322 --> 00:20:17.303]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:17.303 --> 00:20:24.465]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:24.465 --> 00:20:24.945]  Some U.S.
[00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:30.587]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:31.287 --> 00:20:35.169]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:45.272]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:20:45.272 --> 00:20:46.493]  Fabled enemies.

[00:24:12.802 --> 00:24:16.983]  Okay, James and Mark were great callers, but we spent a whole segment with them.
[00:24:16.983 --> 00:24:18.244]  They brought up amazing topics.
[00:24:18.244 --> 00:24:20.004]  That's why I love calls.
[00:24:20.004 --> 00:24:21.444]  The different angles, directions.
[00:24:21.444 --> 00:24:23.445]  It's a grab bag.
[00:24:23.445 --> 00:24:27.506]  Brings up topics that we would never get to here on the show.
[00:24:27.506 --> 00:24:28.226]  But it's the Catch-22.
[00:24:28.226 --> 00:24:30.087]  I'm gonna get to everybody.
[00:24:30.087 --> 00:24:32.027]  I've got to have brevity.
[00:24:32.027 --> 00:24:33.388]  And I'm talking to myself there.
[00:24:33.388 --> 00:24:34.208]  Alex, stop it.
[00:24:34.208 --> 00:24:36.168]  Be brief.
[00:24:36.168 --> 00:24:37.489]  Bill in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:24:37.489 --> 00:24:37.829]  Go ahead.
[00:24:39.006 --> 00:24:57.929]  Yes, my wife works for a old folks home that just recently got bought out and they had this meeting where they're going to start doing random drug testing and they said now if you come positive from one of our drug tests we're going to put you on the no work list and you'll never be able to work again in the United States.
[00:24:57.929 --> 00:25:01.850]  That's what they're telling their employees.
[00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:06.131]  And a lot of those are false positives and see all this sounds good.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:14.251]  But then you're allowed to come up positive for the hundreds of government prescription drugs they push that are even more deadly than most illegal drugs.
[00:25:14.251 --> 00:25:18.157]  And certainly, you know, employees that are drug heads are a problem.
[00:25:18.157 --> 00:25:22.724]  But yes, once they start putting you in databases, that's a whole other level.
[00:25:24.044 --> 00:25:29.126]  I'm not worried about her flunking, but the idea that they're threatening this no-work list, and is there actually such a list?
[00:25:29.126 --> 00:25:31.307]  Yes, they have databases of everything.
[00:25:31.307 --> 00:25:32.928]  They're run by private contractors.
[00:25:32.928 --> 00:25:34.128]  It's all criminal.
[00:25:34.128 --> 00:25:35.569]  It's all hooked into the government.
[00:25:35.569 --> 00:25:37.170]  They want disinfo in there.
[00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.251]  It is a new form of slavery.
[00:25:41.251 --> 00:25:49.595]  Just like there's over a million people on the no-fly list, and they admit that 99.99% have no connection to terrorists, everyone's going to be put on a list.
[00:25:50.214 --> 00:25:58.658]  And then you're going to have to go through government approvement to get off of it, which will then train you to be registered and booked as a trusted traveler, trusted worker.
[00:25:58.658 --> 00:26:00.539]  That was all announced by Homeland Security.
[00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:05.161]  This is total prison grid.
[00:26:05.161 --> 00:26:09.843]  Well, it's like I got turned down for one of those instant, uh, FFL checks.
[00:26:09.843 --> 00:26:11.884]  And now I got to find out how come.
[00:26:11.884 --> 00:26:14.425]  And it's like, well, we, and I asked the guy, how do you do this?
[00:26:14.425 --> 00:26:15.445]  And he goes, I don't know.
[00:26:15.445 --> 00:26:16.706]  No, they're just training you.
[00:26:17.655 --> 00:26:27.644]  And see, suddenly all these years with the instant check, which is a registration, and don't let them tell you it isn't, the gun shops don't want you to know that because they want to just go along with it and have the Second Amendment destroyed.
[00:26:27.644 --> 00:26:28.584]  It's pathetic.
[00:26:28.584 --> 00:26:29.966]  They think cowering is the way to go.
[00:26:29.966 --> 00:26:31.467]  No, let's just be honest.
[00:26:31.467 --> 00:26:34.189]  The power to regulate and track is the power to destroy.
[00:26:34.189 --> 00:26:38.993]  And now I'm talking to famous UT football players who are, you know, from the 60s.
[00:26:40.314 --> 00:26:49.378]  And Darryl Royal championship teams in the 70s, and business owners, and car dealership owners, and restauranteurs who can't buy guns and have no criminal record.
[00:26:49.378 --> 00:26:53.320]  And it's, I mean, it's not just people calling me and emails, it's people I know.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.462]  It's people who are upstanding members of the community.
[00:26:56.462 --> 00:27:04.766]  I mean, it is, it's just, it's everywhere, it's tyranny, it is, we have sown the whirlwind, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:05.723 --> 00:27:12.685]  We have sown the wind, we are reaping the whirlwind, and they are going to rape the daylights out of us until we say no.
[00:27:12.685 --> 00:27:19.126]  And the last thing I have is, I used to work in radio, and just prepping for a one-hour show, I don't see how you do a four-hour.
[00:27:19.126 --> 00:27:20.126]  I just don't.
[00:27:20.126 --> 00:27:20.967]  It's a lot of work.
[00:27:20.967 --> 00:27:23.327]  Well, the enemy's doing so much evil, it's not hard, my friend.
[00:27:23.327 --> 00:27:25.428]  I appreciate your call.
[00:27:25.428 --> 00:27:25.948]  Are you kidding?
[00:27:25.948 --> 00:27:28.148]  I do a bunch of interviews every day, too.
[00:27:28.148 --> 00:27:30.809]  And then people say, you need to do this, you need to do that.
[00:27:30.809 --> 00:27:35.170]  Then I'm accused of running the Patriot community when I don't even run my own, balancing my own checkbook.
[00:27:35.874 --> 00:27:37.275]  People think I'm like omnipresent.
[00:27:37.275 --> 00:27:39.056]  No, I just bust my butt.
[00:27:39.056 --> 00:27:41.778]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ian in Florida.
[00:27:41.778 --> 00:27:43.580]  Ian, you're on the air.
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.880]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.361]  Good, sir.
[00:27:46.361 --> 00:27:51.025]  Hey, I'm wondering if you watched any of the NIST report they did on the webcast this morning.
[00:27:51.722 --> 00:28:07.022]  No, I didn't watch the propaganda cast, but we are lining up tomorrow and next week, Professor Steven Jones and of course engineer Kevin Ryan and architect and engineer folks from that organization.
[00:28:07.022 --> 00:28:10.306]  I don't know, anyone who watched it, it was pretty blatant.
[00:28:10.788 --> 00:28:15.091]  Pretty much they came to the fact that thermal expansion caused the building to collapse.
[00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:18.714]  So fire and the steel expanded and it caused the building to collapse.
[00:28:18.714 --> 00:28:36.367]  Yeah, you have a bunker building, one of the strongest in the country, with three sets of structures in it, built as a CIA command base, the state command base, and the city command base, and then magically, then they lie again and say that a third of the building was scooped out?
[00:28:37.589 --> 00:28:41.752]  I know, they just set a fire, uh, knocked out.
[00:28:41.752 --> 00:28:50.099]  Well, they didn't knock out, but stressed one certain column that... And then that made the whole building perfectly symmetrically collapse.
[00:28:50.099 --> 00:29:05.912]  But they were running a simulation, and the simulation didn't even go to the video, and they cut the simulation off before it even collapsed, because it started collapsing forward instead of imploding, and I work in computer graphics, and I know a bit about simulations, and it's pretty hard if you're using actual physics to
[00:29:07.894 --> 00:29:14.561]  Well, their computer models said that the entire Antarctic this year was going to
[00:29:17.063 --> 00:29:17.803]  Melt.
[00:29:17.803 --> 00:29:24.366]  And that the entire Arctic was going to melt, and instead Antarctic got 33% bigger, and the Antarctic got bigger.
[00:29:24.366 --> 00:29:27.887]  So, you know, just Al Gore says so, so it must be true.
[00:29:27.887 --> 00:29:30.128]  Maybe Al Gore will tell us that the fire made the building fall too.
[00:29:30.128 --> 00:29:31.628]  Maybe he'll tell us he invented the internet.
[00:29:31.628 --> 00:29:34.029]  Maybe he'll tell us the Russians snuck attacked Georgia.
[00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:36.930]  Maybe he'll tell us Mercury isn't in vaccines, or that it is and it's good for us.
[00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:42.453]  Maybe they'll tell us that Iraq has WMDs and artificial sweeteners that are safe for you to eat.
[00:29:42.453 --> 00:29:45.114]  Maybe they'll tell you all these kids around us are dying of cancers.
[00:29:45.114 --> 00:29:49.496]  Maybe they'll tell us that, oh, there's news out, major study, what's causing diabetes?
[00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:51.237]  The shots.
[00:29:51.237 --> 00:29:52.637]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.637 --> 00:29:55.159]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.159 --> 00:29:57.860]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.081 --> 00:30:03.062]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:06.684]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:30:06.684 --> 00:30:09.125]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:30:09.125 --> 00:30:12.166]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:30:12.166 --> 00:30:17.889]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:30:17.889 --> 00:30:21.811]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:27.333]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:10.582]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:31:10.582 --> 00:31:20.389]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston, online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:23.731]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.

[00:31:33.518 --> 00:31:34.339]  Travel less.
[00:31:34.339 --> 00:31:36.100]  Meet online with WebEx.

[00:33:42.448 --> 00:33:45.972]  The free world.
[00:33:45.972 --> 00:33:52.939]  Is this a free world that they're setting up?
[00:33:52.939 --> 00:33:54.521]  No, it's a prison planet.
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.949]  Yeah.
[00:35:09.627 --> 00:35:20.252]  Think about how wicked it is that the criminals that run our government ship the narcotics in and push the deadly legal drugs on our population.
[00:35:20.252 --> 00:35:24.994]  And then set their agents upon us to imprison us for our weaknesses.
[00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:51.138]  The war on terror is really the war on freedom.
[00:35:51.138 --> 00:35:56.319]  Operation Iraqi Freedom is really the war on sovereignty.
[00:35:56.319 --> 00:35:57.339]  It's a genocide war.
[00:36:01.286 --> 00:36:05.710]  Have you noticed Budweiser now has come out with new bottles and new beer?
[00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:10.113]  They're calling it Budweiser American Eagle.
[00:36:10.113 --> 00:36:11.534]  American pride.
[00:36:11.534 --> 00:36:21.062]  Kindler, gentler, machine gun hand.
[00:36:36.357 --> 00:36:40.380]  There's a problem with the new American Ale brand by Budweiser.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:44.082]  They never called it American Ale.
[00:36:44.082 --> 00:36:45.803]  They never called it American.
[00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:47.705]  It was just American.
[00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:53.789]  But now that it's not American, they're gonna call it American.
[00:36:53.789 --> 00:36:54.669]  The big lie.
[00:36:54.669 --> 00:36:59.512]  Do I care if Budweiser is owned by a Dutch company?
[00:36:59.512 --> 00:37:00.933]  No.
[00:37:00.933 --> 00:37:01.494]  Does it matter?
[00:37:02.984 --> 00:37:05.487]  If our roads are being taken over, yes.
[00:37:05.487 --> 00:37:10.633]  Our ports, our schools, our governments.
[00:37:10.633 --> 00:37:15.919]  There's an example to all of you yuppies that just can't get it.
[00:37:15.919 --> 00:37:17.501]  And just can't understand what it is.
[00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:20.524]  There's the lie, the big lie, right there.
[00:37:20.524 --> 00:37:23.628]  The minute they take it over, the minute it's not American Ale anymore.
[00:37:25.106 --> 00:37:27.609]  You know Budweiser for years isn't even real beer.
[00:37:27.609 --> 00:37:33.656]  They just create an alcoholic syrup that tastes like beer and shoot it into water and tell you how fresh it is and you go out and buy it.
[00:37:33.656 --> 00:37:35.118]  Again, it's all frauds.
[00:37:35.118 --> 00:37:36.259]  It's all lies.
[00:37:36.259 --> 00:37:38.562]  We can't have anything real anymore.
[00:37:38.562 --> 00:37:41.725]  Not the name, not where it's from, not what it is.
[00:37:41.725 --> 00:37:42.506]  It's not even beer.
[00:37:42.506 --> 00:37:45.810]  It's just a syrup pop drink with some liquor in it.
[00:37:51.115 --> 00:38:04.779]  I got a report here I want to get to later about, as we've already seen in studies, another big study out, that massive links to the inoculations and diabetes in children.
[00:38:04.779 --> 00:38:10.961]  And I just hear it all over talk radio, all over the streets, I see the actual numbers as cancer explodes everywhere.
[00:38:13.345 --> 00:38:28.452]  I'm just so sad when I hear these parents crying and weeping and begging and trying to save their little 3 and 4 and 5 year olds dying of cancer, dying of the bioweapon attack, dying from the GMO food, dying from the plagues that are upon us.
[00:38:30.171 --> 00:38:31.432]  And they're not going to listen to me.
[00:38:31.432 --> 00:38:32.372]  They're not going to wake up.
[00:38:32.372 --> 00:38:33.913]  They're not going to turn it around.
[00:38:33.913 --> 00:38:35.914]  That goes for people who work for the government.
[00:38:35.914 --> 00:38:37.395]  FBI agents' kids are dying.
[00:38:37.395 --> 00:38:38.876]  Cops' kids are dying.
[00:38:38.876 --> 00:38:39.696]  You're not going to listen.
[00:38:39.696 --> 00:38:42.377]  You've got to get hurt real bad by your masters.
[00:38:42.377 --> 00:38:46.900]  You've got to go to absolute rock bottom before you turn around, don't you?
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:47.680]  Or maybe not.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.761]  I mean, I have been doing interviews again.
[00:38:49.761 --> 00:38:53.243]  I've cut back lately trying to finish some films to only three or four a week.
[00:38:53.243 --> 00:38:54.444]  I've been doing a couple a day again.
[00:38:55.314 --> 00:38:57.855]  And I'm on adversarial radio shows.
[00:38:57.855 --> 00:38:59.796]  I'm on neutral radio programs.
[00:38:59.796 --> 00:39:03.097]  I'm on radio shows that are on my side.
[00:39:03.097 --> 00:39:08.139]  And almost every caller calls in and agrees with me.
[00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:11.181]  Police officers call in, who the hosts know, and say, he's telling the truth.
[00:39:11.181 --> 00:39:12.321]  We're being federalized.
[00:39:12.321 --> 00:39:13.422]  I didn't believe it.
[00:39:13.422 --> 00:39:13.962]  It's true.
[00:39:13.962 --> 00:39:16.903]  There really are provocateurs.
[00:39:16.903 --> 00:39:19.084]  You know, the stuff he's saying is accurate.
[00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:27.016]  You see, we can turn it around if we're just man and woman enough to admit what we've turned into.
[00:39:27.016 --> 00:39:29.197]  What we've become.
[00:39:29.197 --> 00:39:30.277]  Am I the best messenger?
[00:39:30.277 --> 00:39:31.518]  Do I have all the answers?
[00:39:31.518 --> 00:39:32.358]  Am I obnoxious?
[00:39:32.358 --> 00:39:33.879]  Do I make mistakes?
[00:39:33.879 --> 00:39:35.620]  Undoubtedly.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.421]  Do I like having to be the mouthpiece here?
[00:39:38.421 --> 00:39:39.662]  And to have all the attention on me?
[00:39:39.662 --> 00:39:40.942]  Do I like the danger it brings?
[00:39:40.942 --> 00:39:42.043]  Absolutely not.
[00:39:42.043 --> 00:39:45.484]  But I am committed to this, and I care about each and every one of you out there.
[00:39:45.484 --> 00:39:48.145]  Do I get angry at you?
[00:39:48.145 --> 00:39:49.186]  Do we get angry with each other?
[00:39:50.183 --> 00:39:52.605]  Is society falling apart?
[00:39:52.605 --> 00:39:53.466]  Yes.
[00:39:53.466 --> 00:39:54.907]  Does it make it tough on everybody?
[00:39:54.907 --> 00:39:59.170]  Police, citizens, firefighters, school teachers?
[00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.251]  It's tough on all of us.
[00:40:00.251 --> 00:40:07.877]  We're all in this together against a few thousand globalists who control the world's currency issuance and liquidity.
[00:40:07.877 --> 00:40:10.460]  And they are building a very, very bad world.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.162]  A selfish world only for them.
[00:40:13.162 --> 00:40:15.764]  And it's time to break the chains, the mental chains.
[00:40:19.733 --> 00:40:27.839]  Now, briefly, and then I'm going to go to Raphael, Lindsey, Sherry, Clayton, and others.
[00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:30.140]  What is Continuity of Government?
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:41.769]  It is modern, scientifically packaged and crafted, and tested, martial law.
[00:40:41.769 --> 00:40:46.492]  But it's more than just total federalization, complete takeover of local communities.
[00:40:49.517 --> 00:40:53.539]  It is a takeover of the tyrannical government itself.
[00:40:53.539 --> 00:41:10.326]  It is a further centralizing from the states to the feds, from the feds to homeland security, from homeland security to private international contracting bodies and the president.
[00:41:10.326 --> 00:41:17.929]  It is the complete and total domination and takeover of the United States and it's been done in every other major nation.
[00:41:24.406 --> 00:41:29.128]  The shadow government dominated and took over Japan and never relinquished control.
[00:41:29.128 --> 00:41:33.150]  The shadow government took over South Korea and never relinquished control.
[00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:38.772]  The shadow global government took control of Germany and Europe and never relinquished control.
[00:41:38.772 --> 00:41:52.638]  The shadow government has taken control of the United States and is expanding that control and removing the last checks and balances to open dictatorship of the elite, of the oligarchs.
[00:41:55.026 --> 00:41:57.127]  And then you study who runs NORTHCOM.
[00:41:57.127 --> 00:42:00.869]  You study who runs the defense contractors.
[00:42:00.869 --> 00:42:05.712]  You study who controls the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:42:05.712 --> 00:42:13.496]  And it is made up of European, British, Israeli, and U.S.
[00:42:13.496 --> 00:42:20.179]  banks and financial institutions who are now in control of this nation.
[00:42:22.328 --> 00:42:36.800]  And at the highest levels, they are openly putting in British officers, Israeli officers, Dutch officers, German officers, at the highest levels of the continuity of government system.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:45.887]  And handing over authority to private contractors, which are fully and wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign governments and corporations.
[00:42:47.822 --> 00:42:52.324]  You see, once you get federal control, then you can take control of the federal government.
[00:42:52.324 --> 00:42:55.586]  That's why the New World Order loves centralization.
[00:42:55.586 --> 00:43:01.188]  That's why they'll work with a communist dictator, a fascist dictator, a racial dictator.
[00:43:01.188 --> 00:43:05.090]  They'll work with anyone who centralizes.
[00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:16.976]  Because once they've centralized, they can focus their intelligence arms, private, corporate government, into those already centralized systems and gain full control.
[00:43:20.106 --> 00:43:21.407]  And that has now happened.
[00:43:21.407 --> 00:43:35.718]  We have to come to grips with the fact that our nation is completely dominated, similar to what China was 150 years ago, through the turn of the 20th century.
[00:43:35.718 --> 00:43:41.623]  We are subdivided, we are controlled, we are being sold off on the auction block globally right now.
[00:43:48.519 --> 00:43:53.981]  The NSA spies on whoever they want, whenever they want, for economic gain and espionage on the people.
[00:43:53.981 --> 00:43:59.103]  They spy on the mayors, the governors, the legislatures, the congress, the parliaments.
[00:43:59.103 --> 00:44:01.163]  This has all been admitted.
[00:44:01.163 --> 00:44:05.505]  They have hit teams to murder anyone in high positions of power that tries to expose them.
[00:44:09.022 --> 00:44:18.348]  And the global ruling elite are social engineers and have believed in eugenics for 140 plus years and are carrying out en masse against us now.
[00:44:18.348 --> 00:44:31.978]  They are murdering us, they are killing us, and no one else that I know of understands the paradigm to the level that we on this show do, and that is the one reason they have not killed us
[00:44:35.271 --> 00:44:40.915]  Is because they don't want to underline and highlight and exclamation point everything we're saying.
[00:44:40.915 --> 00:44:49.000]  They don't want our words glowing like brightest neon in the dead of this tyrannical darkness.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.783]  Does that mean they won't try to implant me with cancer or run me over or kill me or set me up if they can?
[00:44:54.783 --> 00:44:56.704]  Undoubtedly.
[00:44:56.704 --> 00:45:02.308]  Do I barricade doors as a security precaution when I'm out of my home?
[00:45:02.308 --> 00:45:02.988]  Absolutely.
[00:45:02.988 --> 00:45:03.969]  Do I do that out of fear?
[00:45:04.764 --> 00:45:11.708]  No, I do that out of understanding enemy operations.
[00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:15.450]  This is very serious waters we're in.
[00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:20.113]  And I do everything I do out of love of the people.
[00:45:20.113 --> 00:45:22.855]  And a spirit of self-preservation.
[00:45:22.855 --> 00:45:31.680]  By preserving the nation and by preserving your liberty, I preserve my liberty and my children and family's liberty.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.701]  My family line.
[00:45:33.596 --> 00:45:34.657]  is what matters.
[00:45:34.657 --> 00:45:39.899]  My tribe, my people, and we are all connected to each other.
[00:45:39.899 --> 00:45:47.442]  I understand that life is transitory for the individual, but it is eternal in the species.
[00:45:47.442 --> 00:45:57.367]  It has a potential to be, and that is as sure as life, as sure as death, that we have the potential to people the stars.
[00:45:57.367 --> 00:45:58.167]  We have the potential
[00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:13.444]  To metamorphosize into wonderful things if we do not allow the destructive technocrats that are destroying the original creation to build their own monstrous system in their image.
[00:46:13.444 --> 00:46:14.866]  We need to become more wise.
[00:46:14.866 --> 00:46:23.134]  We need to study our technologies and let them grow more slowly and be more cautious and not let our species be overtaken and destroyed.
[00:46:25.052 --> 00:46:26.213]  Yes, how are you doing Alex?
[00:46:26.213 --> 00:46:28.334]  I just want to tell you I'm a great fan.
[00:46:28.334 --> 00:46:30.755]  I want to thank you and Jason for opening my eyes.
[00:46:30.755 --> 00:46:32.616]  I was blind just like everyone else.
[00:46:53.912 --> 00:46:58.596]  Uh, until I saw loose change, I just want to thank you for, you know, opening my eyes.
[00:46:58.596 --> 00:47:02.940]  It was a, you know, eye-opening experience.
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:03.520]  Well, thank you.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.021]  Is there anything on your mind?
[00:47:05.021 --> 00:47:09.165]  Yes, um, I just want to talk briefly about the NYST.
[00:47:09.165 --> 00:47:13.728]  Their propaganda proposal they just had this morning.
[00:47:13.728 --> 00:47:18.332]  And, um, they, you know, there's a lot of questions in the proposal.
[00:47:18.332 --> 00:47:23.016]  There's, uh, obviously, you know, they say the buildings went down again because of the fires, which is ridiculous.
[00:47:25.024 --> 00:47:28.687]  And, uh, one of your InfoWars reporters was cut off.
[00:47:28.687 --> 00:47:30.749]  I don't know if you know about this.
[00:47:30.749 --> 00:47:32.490]  No, what happened?
[00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:46.861]  Well, one of your InfoWars reporters was asking a question about how can you say there was no, um, demolition or explosives in the building if there was no metal to investigate.
[00:47:46.861 --> 00:47:49.183]  There was no metal actually, you know, to investigate.
[00:47:49.183 --> 00:47:50.764]  Yeah, why did they cover up the crime scene?
[00:47:51.391 --> 00:47:59.275]  Right, so your reporter was asking a very valid question and of course he got caught off.
[00:47:59.275 --> 00:48:00.276]  How did he get caught off?
[00:48:00.276 --> 00:48:03.398]  Did they cut the feed or did somebody cut his mic off?
[00:48:03.398 --> 00:48:07.160]  Someone cut his mic off and it was very
[00:48:08.556 --> 00:48:10.336]  I mean, they cut him off totally.
[00:48:10.336 --> 00:48:12.877]  It was very unprofessional.
[00:48:12.877 --> 00:48:21.719]  And of course, the professor, Dr. Sudar, I think his name was, Sudar, obviously gave a false answer.
[00:48:21.719 --> 00:48:24.480]  It was a terrible answer to the question.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.761]  And it's just unbelievable how we keep getting cut off for asking valid questions.
[00:48:28.761 --> 00:48:30.062]  Well, I didn't watch this.
[00:48:30.062 --> 00:48:32.962]  Was the person physically there, or was it part of the web conference?
[00:48:32.962 --> 00:48:34.923]  They were taking calls or questions from the Internet.
[00:48:36.061 --> 00:48:37.302]  The reporter was physically there.
[00:48:37.302 --> 00:48:40.285]  They were also taking web questions, but he was physically there.
[00:48:40.285 --> 00:48:43.007]  He physically asked the question, and they cut his question.
[00:48:43.007 --> 00:48:45.910]  He was the only reporter to get his question cut off.
[00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:46.951]  Of course.
[00:48:46.951 --> 00:48:52.055]  Now, um... Well, that's it.
[00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:54.237]  I mean, they said they were with InfoWars?
[00:48:54.237 --> 00:48:54.678]  Yes.
[00:48:54.678 --> 00:48:56.319]  Well, that's what he said.
[00:48:56.319 --> 00:49:00.463]  I forget his name, but he did say, I am a reporter for InfoWars.com.
[00:49:01.249 --> 00:49:03.270]  Probably Luke Radowski or somebody.
[00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.892]  We need to get whoever that was, have them call into the show.
[00:49:06.892 --> 00:49:11.834]  If it's one of our people, they'll have a hotline number, call in.
[00:49:11.834 --> 00:49:19.057]  Let me guess, what did, by the way, those on NIST are all top thermite explosives experts.
[00:49:19.057 --> 00:49:24.599]  There's only maybe 20 of them in the world or less, and it just so happens they're all working at NIST.
[00:49:24.599 --> 00:49:25.840]  Very interesting.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:30.162]  And involved in the reports as well, and involved in government black ops projects.
[00:49:30.162 --> 00:49:30.622]  No big deal.
[00:49:31.483 --> 00:49:35.287]  Let me guess, I bet he claimed falsely that all the evidence was studied.
[00:49:35.287 --> 00:49:36.669]  The steel wasn't hauled away.
[00:49:36.669 --> 00:49:37.530]  Did he say something like that?
[00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.893]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:39.893 --> 00:49:47.001]  Also, he said that he was open to all possibilities, but later on he contradicted himself by saying that he didn't even
[00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:56.515]  They didn't even, uh, see a reason to, uh, to investigate thermite in the buildings because it was impossible.
[00:49:56.515 --> 00:49:57.035]  Oh, yes.
[00:49:57.035 --> 00:49:58.076]  Impossible.
[00:49:58.076 --> 00:49:58.836]  Which is crazy.
[00:49:58.836 --> 00:50:07.361]  I mean, you have all the, uh, multiple samples with it and video of gouts of it pouring out, burning seconds before it collapses as they ignite.
[00:50:07.361 --> 00:50:08.222]  Yes.
[00:50:08.222 --> 00:50:08.882]  Unbelievable.
[00:50:08.882 --> 00:50:12.264]  And you have the police saying, get back, we're blowing it up with a countdown.
[00:50:12.264 --> 00:50:13.785]  We're not saying the police were involved.
[00:50:13.785 --> 00:50:15.426]  They were just told, get everybody back, it's coming down.
[00:50:17.037 --> 00:50:17.918]  Yes, I know.
[00:50:17.918 --> 00:50:31.686]  And BBC caught announcing how it fell, exactly how it fell before, and then now admitting that Reuters put that out internally, that it had already collapsed with a false start, just like they reported that Lee Harvey Oswald, before he'd been captured, or his name was in the news, well, they got the time zones off.
[00:50:31.686 --> 00:50:32.166]  That happens.
[00:50:32.166 --> 00:50:33.627]  You know, these black op guys make mistakes.
[00:50:33.627 --> 00:50:34.748]  They're not perfect.
[00:50:34.748 --> 00:50:42.032]  They reported in New Zealand, Australian, and other papers that Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy, and this is a fact, before he was even captured.
[00:50:42.032 --> 00:50:43.653]  Hmm, no big deal though, huh?
[00:50:45.694 --> 00:50:46.294]  No big deal.
[00:50:46.294 --> 00:50:47.075]  Government loves you.
[00:50:47.075 --> 00:50:48.456]  They wouldn't hurt you.
[00:50:48.456 --> 00:50:51.418]  People that have power and rule the earth aren't evil.
[00:50:51.418 --> 00:50:53.920]  They don't want power.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.861]  They're not cunning.
[00:50:54.861 --> 00:50:56.542]  They won't hurt you.
[00:50:56.542 --> 00:50:58.283]  They're good.
[00:50:58.283 --> 00:50:59.644]  They've never lied to you.
[00:51:01.323 --> 00:51:08.093]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:08.093 --> 00:51:10.736]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:10.736 --> 00:51:12.278]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:12.278 --> 00:51:13.079]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:13.079 --> 00:51:13.941]  This is his MO.
[00:51:13.941 --> 00:51:15.443]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:15.443 --> 00:51:17.005]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:17.425 --> 00:51:24.567]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:24.567 --> 00:51:25.048]  Some U.S.
[00:51:25.048 --> 00:51:31.410]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:34.851]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:51:35.111 --> 00:51:45.375]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:51:45.375 --> 00:51:46.615]  Fabled enemies.

[00:52:02.017 --> 00:52:08.159]  Have you ever suffered from Giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[00:52:08.159 --> 00:52:14.722]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.
[00:52:14.722 --> 00:52:24.185]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has been used all over the world by health-conscious individuals seeking alternatives to chemicals and drugs.

[00:52:52.478 --> 00:52:52.719]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:53:00.788 --> 00:53:01.728]  Hey, Clyde!
[00:53:01.728 --> 00:53:02.728]  What's up, Bonnie?
[00:53:02.728 --> 00:53:07.189]  Well, I got a question about those shielded, secure sleeves from Identity Stronghold.
[00:53:07.189 --> 00:53:11.930]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers from the new credit cards with RFID chips.
[00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:12.731]  What about them?
[00:53:12.731 --> 00:53:17.172]  Well, I mentioned them to our friends and they went in for purchasing the secure sleeves.
[00:53:17.172 --> 00:53:18.192]  Oh, Bonnie!
[00:53:18.192 --> 00:53:24.693]  If everyone starts hearing about the secure sleeve, it'll destroy our plan to steal credit card numbers at the mall with my new RFID reader.
[00:53:24.693 --> 00:53:26.434]  I know, but these are our friends, Clyde.
[00:53:26.434 --> 00:53:27.994]  They promised not to tell anyone else.
[00:53:28.394 --> 00:53:29.355]  I guess you're right.
[00:53:29.355 --> 00:53:31.157]  That's what friends are for, I suppose.
[00:53:31.157 --> 00:53:36.922]  Tell them they can get a five-pack of secure sleeves that will fit credit cards and driver's licenses for $19.95.
[00:53:36.922 --> 00:53:42.328]  And Identity Stronghold also has a three-pack of secure sleeves for passport books for $14.95.
[00:53:42.328 --> 00:53:43.689]  And where do they buy them?
[00:53:43.689 --> 00:53:47.853]  They can buy them online or get a mail-in order form at IDStronghold.com.
[00:53:47.853 --> 00:53:50.035]  IDStronghold.com.
[00:53:50.035 --> 00:53:51.477]  Okay, well, what if they don't have the Internet?
[00:53:51.937 --> 00:53:52.398]  They can call 1-800-610-2770.
[00:53:52.398 --> 00:53:52.698]  That's 800-610-2770.
[00:53:52.698 --> 00:53:52.938]  Thanks Clyde!
[00:54:18.081 --> 00:54:19.802]  You know, sometimes
[00:54:56.208 --> 00:55:00.551]  Fabled Enemies comes out in 10 days.
[00:55:00.551 --> 00:55:02.632]  Get yours first.
[00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:03.532]  Pre-orders come in.
[00:55:03.532 --> 00:55:06.274]  We'll have them packaged, ready to ship out.
[00:55:06.274 --> 00:55:07.674]  You'll get them first.
[00:55:07.674 --> 00:55:08.475]  InfoWars.com.
[00:55:11.886 --> 00:55:14.147]  Toll-free number to get fabled enemies.
[00:55:14.147 --> 00:55:16.669]  The big 9-11 film getting into the intelligence agencies.
[00:55:16.669 --> 00:55:21.452]  The Israelis, the Pakistanis, the British, Cheney, Continental government.
[00:55:21.452 --> 00:55:28.936]  The anthrax attacks.
[00:55:28.936 --> 00:55:31.157]  The toll-free number to call and get it is 888-253-3139. 888.
[00:55:39.761 --> 00:55:40.361]  Good day, Alex.
[00:55:40.361 --> 00:55:40.862]  How are you?
[00:55:40.862 --> 00:55:41.442]  Good, sir.
[00:55:41.442 --> 00:55:46.004]  I liked your caller that mentioned about doing things with the chalk.
[00:55:46.004 --> 00:55:46.344]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:46.344 --> 00:55:47.865]  And you said, ah, that was interesting.
[00:55:47.865 --> 00:55:49.446]  You know, something different.
[00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:52.267]  Here's one for you, and this came about
[00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:11.934]  Uh, there was a viewer not too long ago that was found out your site was censored like in London or something of that nature on the computer on the internet.
[00:56:11.934 --> 00:56:23.861]  And I wondered, I wonder if I go to my little library here in town, uh, they have about eight terminals, and punch in InfoWars, if it would come up or if it would be filtered, if you will.
[00:56:23.861 --> 00:56:27.923]  I went down there, punched it up, nope, it came on the screen, and it dawned on me.
[00:56:28.607 --> 00:56:38.215]  I left it on the screen and I went to theirs about three other ones that were open and punched up your site and just left it on the screen for other people that would shut down next.
[00:56:38.215 --> 00:56:39.576]  That's the first thing they'd see.
[00:56:39.576 --> 00:56:43.019]  Now whether they look at it or not made no difference, but there it was.
[00:56:43.019 --> 00:56:44.461]  Another way of spreading things.
[00:56:44.461 --> 00:56:45.602]  Good job.
[00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:46.542]  What do you think of that?
[00:56:46.542 --> 00:56:47.083]  It's awesome.
[00:56:47.083 --> 00:56:47.923]  I've done that myself.
[00:56:49.306 --> 00:56:51.607]  At the Mac Store picking up one of our home computers.
[00:56:51.607 --> 00:56:58.028]  You know, they say it's ready and you go pick it up and it's not ready or there's some huge line and I'll go around like 20 terminals.
[00:56:58.028 --> 00:57:09.711]  Also, with the local Patriot stations like 90.1 and the times I've been, say, in a Circuit City or a Best Buy, I would just obnoxiously turn all the radios on to it.
[00:57:09.711 --> 00:57:11.572]  Or if I'm in a rent car, I'll put it on to that.
[00:57:12.192 --> 00:57:13.913]  I mean, absolutely.
[00:57:13.913 --> 00:57:15.333]  I've done similar things.
[00:57:15.333 --> 00:57:32.501]  Well, that's like I'm saying, if you just think of the millions of libraries with the millions of public terminals available, if people just went, left it on, and again, whether somebody wants to come on and look at it all of a sudden they see it or ignore it and go on to some other mindless news, that's their business.
[00:57:32.501 --> 00:57:35.602]  But there it is, and it's an interesting way of kind of spreading the site.
[00:57:36.417 --> 00:57:39.979]  Absolutely, or just printing out little cards, even little paper cards.
[00:57:39.979 --> 00:57:42.400]  I've done a little bit more than that.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:49.843]  I went and printed out a bunch of, on my printer, www.infowars.com.
[00:57:49.843 --> 00:57:56.726]  You go down the road, all the time you see little survey stakes with garage sale signs or whatever.
[00:57:56.726 --> 00:57:57.487]  People see these.
[00:57:58.326 --> 00:58:03.233]  And so, randomly, I'll just tack these on there and just put them up and down the road here and there.
[00:58:03.233 --> 00:58:04.715]  That's awesome, yeah.
[00:58:04.715 --> 00:58:08.640]  And, you know, you can also, just where the newspaper, the free newspapers are out when you walk into a restaurant,
[00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:11.990]  It doesn't even have to be fancy hard cards.
[00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:17.392]  You can do like, I don't know, 10, 15, however many normal cards go on the face of a normal piece of paper.
[00:58:17.392 --> 00:58:22.313]  You just cut those up, flimsy paper, probably cost you about half a cent per card or less.
[00:58:22.313 --> 00:58:23.894]  I don't know how much a whole sheet of paper is.
[00:58:23.894 --> 00:58:29.436]  And then you just drop those around with whatever website or radio show or information you want.
[00:58:29.436 --> 00:58:33.137]  And if everybody starts doing things like that, the New World Order will come down.
[00:58:33.137 --> 00:58:33.477]  If not,
[00:58:34.419 --> 00:58:35.260]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.061]  I appreciate your call, Lindsey.
[00:58:37.061 --> 00:58:38.122]  Keep it up.
[00:58:38.122 --> 00:58:42.065]  Sherry, Clayton, and others, stay with us.
[00:58:42.065 --> 00:58:47.190]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:51.693]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.693 --> 00:58:58.679]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:00.733]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:59:00.733 --> 00:59:07.783]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:59:07.783 --> 00:59:12.931]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[00:59:13.902 --> 00:59:16.666]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[00:59:16.666 --> 00:59:23.755]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:59:23.755 --> 00:59:26.939]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:59:26.939 --> 00:59:32.025]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:59:32.706 --> 00:59:35.788]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:59:35.788 --> 00:59:41.830]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:44.752]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:59:44.752 --> 00:59:53.976]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:59:53.976 --> 00:59:56.357]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.357 --> 00:59:59.119]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.726 --> 01:00:10.567]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.567 --> 01:00:12.127]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.127 --> 01:00:13.688]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.688 --> 01:00:17.889]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.889 --> 01:00:22.190]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:26.791]  Alright, here we go.
[01:00:26.791 --> 01:00:30.432]  Jason Burmiss just popped in to the studio.
[01:00:30.432 --> 01:00:31.372]  He heard the caller.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:39.542]  Rafael in New York, who was watching live on TV, on the internet feed, that he missed how the towers collapsed.
[01:00:39.542 --> 01:00:40.943]  Uh, fairy tale number 10.
[01:00:40.943 --> 01:00:45.324]  They've had a, well, scores of different disinformation.
[01:00:45.324 --> 01:00:49.285]  They've changed their story, I know, six times now.
[01:00:49.285 --> 01:00:51.146]  This is the sixth, uh, new story.
[01:00:51.146 --> 01:00:54.607]  And then there's been scores of subplots.
[01:00:54.607 --> 01:01:01.529]  They were explaining how the towers fell and how the Easter Bunny and the leprechauns and the Keebler elves were in there chewing with termites on the metal.
[01:01:03.041 --> 01:01:09.663]  And a fella popped by the office and we said, yes, you can say you're with InfoWars as a freelance reporter.
[01:01:09.663 --> 01:01:12.104]  And then NIST called here.
[01:01:12.104 --> 01:01:18.426]  Burmish just informed me, thank God, Trey was there answering the phone, our skeleton crew, and said, yes, that guy is our reporter.
[01:01:18.426 --> 01:01:22.547]  And so he got into the NIST report and asked the question, did a great job.
[01:01:22.547 --> 01:01:25.368]  Now we need that fella to call into the show.
[01:01:25.368 --> 01:01:29.909]  So that is just fabulous.
[01:01:29.909 --> 01:01:31.990]  Don't forget, we had Anthony Yasha,
[01:01:33.504 --> 01:01:37.326]  Who's even worked at Genesis, with a desk!
[01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:38.306]  He lives up in Minneapolis-St.
[01:01:38.306 --> 01:01:42.248]  Paul, that's where Genesis is, in Burnsville, a suburb.
[01:01:42.248 --> 01:01:45.730]  And, you know, Ted doesn't have press passes, and he said, can I have one?
[01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:49.552]  And they said, yeah, just make one.
[01:01:49.552 --> 01:01:54.614]  And then, Anthony reports for us, his footage is in Truth Rising, and he said, can I have a press pass?
[01:01:54.614 --> 01:01:55.735]  I said, yeah, just make one.
[01:01:55.735 --> 01:01:57.156]  We need to make a standard one ourselves.
[01:01:57.156 --> 01:02:01.078]  We're just giving orders to armies that don't exist.
[01:02:01.078 --> 01:02:01.498]  And, uh,
[01:02:02.245 --> 01:02:17.578]  Secret Service bullied us and had two meetings with Ted and demanded that he say that Anthony was a liar and never worked for us or didn't have authorization to have a press pass and they want to charge him with false documents and some type of espionage is what they told him.
[01:02:17.578 --> 01:02:19.099]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:02:19.099 --> 01:02:26.865]  The guy has a desk at Genesis and it's not enough.
[01:02:26.865 --> 01:02:30.988]  I'm already digressing and I said I'm taking your calls, but good job to the Info Warrior.
[01:02:30.988 --> 01:02:31.609]  We salute you.
[01:02:33.214 --> 01:02:36.175]  I guess when Aaron gets in, he was up until three in the morning.
[01:02:36.175 --> 01:02:37.615]  He'll have the guy's name and info.
[01:02:37.615 --> 01:02:42.597]  I couldn't talk to him when he was here.
[01:02:42.597 --> 01:02:46.258]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:02:46.258 --> 01:02:47.558]  Sherry in Texas.
[01:02:47.558 --> 01:02:49.119]  Welcome, Sherry.
[01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:49.699]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:50.399]  How you doing?
[01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:52.000]  I'm doing pretty good, Sherry.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.660]  Really good show today so far.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.200]  Thank you.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:03:02.163]  I was just going to say, you know, yeah, we have to band together against the war because, you know, they love to use racial
[01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:04.220]  They like to draw the racial lines.
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:09.283]  They like to use the left-right paradigm, you know, to throw us off track, off the real issues.
[01:03:09.283 --> 01:03:15.386]  And, um, you know, it's happened, you know, over and over and over again, um, just in the last few months.
[01:03:15.386 --> 01:03:22.691]  Um, also, you know, I've been trying to tell people here, you know, they're, they really are, you know, poignant kids.
[01:03:22.691 --> 01:03:23.631]  You know that, right?
[01:03:23.631 --> 01:03:26.733]  And they're like, well, you know, how can, you know, how do you know that?
[01:03:26.733 --> 01:03:28.494]  And I'm like, okay, well, let's look at the evidence.
[01:03:28.494 --> 01:03:31.916]  They already have iris scanners at Raleigh High School.
[01:03:32.458 --> 01:03:34.119]  You know, right down the road from where you live.
[01:03:34.119 --> 01:03:38.682]  You know, they have iris scanners scanning all your kids' little irises.
[01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:42.125]  And the government admits it's training them for the prison society.
[01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:42.865]  Exactly.
[01:03:42.865 --> 01:03:48.349]  You know, it's the, you know, Orwellian untruths of our new prison planet.
[01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:50.190]  It really is.
[01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:53.593]  And I remember 10, 12 years ago reading federal documents on air.
[01:03:53.593 --> 01:03:58.476]  They were going to put retina scanners, thumb scanners, and cameras, and the parents would laugh.
[01:03:58.476 --> 01:04:00.858]  But see, because we warned them, now they're not laughing.
[01:04:01.525 --> 01:04:06.431]  Yeah, and our ACT scores last year at GISD were the lowest they've ever been.
[01:04:06.431 --> 01:04:09.114]  But they're learning how to be prisoners.
[01:04:09.114 --> 01:04:09.574]  Exactly.
[01:04:09.574 --> 01:04:12.097]  They're learning how to be stupid, dumb, down sheep.
[01:04:12.097 --> 01:04:15.321]  And, you know, there's a petition now to lower the drinking age from 21 to 18.
[01:04:17.952 --> 01:04:19.053]  Yeah, we don't need that.
[01:04:19.053 --> 01:04:23.135]  You know, I had always, when I was young, said, yeah, lower it.
[01:04:23.135 --> 01:04:26.758]  Now I realize what a horrible driver I was when I was 16.
[01:04:26.758 --> 01:04:29.519]  I realize how lucky I am to be alive.
[01:04:29.519 --> 01:04:34.442]  I never even got that much into alcohol, but, you know, might have gotten drunk four or five times a year, and that was dangerous.
[01:04:34.442 --> 01:04:39.005]  I rode around with drunks, and now that I have children, I'm like,
[01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:40.170]  I don't know.
[01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:42.853]  A lot of that's just personal responsibility.
[01:04:42.853 --> 01:04:49.099]  I just more and more think alcohol is really a bad thing, but at the same time, they use it... They'll never get rid of it.
[01:04:49.099 --> 01:04:50.601]  They'll just use it for tyranny.
[01:04:50.601 --> 01:04:51.942]  So I certainly don't want prohibition.
[01:04:51.942 --> 01:04:53.744]  That increases alcoholism.
[01:04:53.744 --> 01:04:55.205]  Good to hear from you, Sherry.
[01:04:55.205 --> 01:04:56.166]  Great points.
[01:04:56.166 --> 01:04:58.409]  Clayton, Philly, and many others.
[01:04:58.409 --> 01:04:59.049]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.049 --> 01:05:00.110]  InfoWars.com.
[01:05:01.949 --> 01:05:08.699]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:08.699 --> 01:05:11.343]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:05:11.343 --> 01:05:12.906]  But who is the enemy?
[01:05:12.906 --> 01:05:13.707]  Bin Laden.
[01:05:13.707 --> 01:05:14.708]  This is his MO.
[01:05:14.708 --> 01:05:16.090]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:17.633]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:05:18.033 --> 01:05:25.203]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:05:25.203 --> 01:05:25.684]  Some U.S.
[01:05:25.684 --> 01:05:32.052]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:05:32.052 --> 01:05:35.497]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:05:35.737 --> 01:05:46.003]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:05:46.003 --> 01:05:47.244]  Fabled enemies.

[01:08:01.608 --> 01:08:03.852]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.852 --> 01:08:07.158]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.224 --> 01:08:34.313]  We are back live, blitzing through your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231, Philly in Denver, site of the police state advertisement slave training grid that I'll be in the middle of, trying to expose any provocateur police or feds posing as anarchists or foundation hired anarchists that are being bivouacked and protected by the police.
[01:08:34.313 --> 01:08:40.055]  We've caught them red-handed being housed by them and caught them staging violence and you will be defeated.
[01:08:40.766 --> 01:08:42.388]  We may actually stop them this year.
[01:08:42.388 --> 01:08:47.352]  That'll be a self-fulfilling prophecy of, oh, there wasn't any provocateur attacks.
[01:08:47.352 --> 01:08:49.975]  You didn't get to, you know, there was no riots.
[01:08:49.975 --> 01:08:51.857]  Yeah, because we stopped them.
[01:08:51.857 --> 01:08:52.858]  We are changed.
[01:08:52.858 --> 01:08:53.859]  Denver stopped them.
[01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:55.040]  We are changed, Colorado.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.101]  But we'll see what happens.
[01:08:56.101 --> 01:08:57.662]  That is in the future.
[01:08:57.662 --> 01:09:00.585]  We will, we shall see, as they say.
[01:09:00.585 --> 01:09:03.147]  Let's go ahead and go to Philly and Denver.
[01:09:03.147 --> 01:09:03.748]  Philly, welcome.
[01:09:04.597 --> 01:09:05.117]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:09:05.117 --> 01:09:05.958]  How are you doing today?
[01:09:05.958 --> 01:09:07.159]  Good.
[01:09:07.159 --> 01:09:11.282]  I'm a 9-1-1 visibility member, as well as We Are Change Colorado.
[01:09:11.282 --> 01:09:15.665]  And if anyone out there doesn't believe that we are in a police state, you are sadly misguided.
[01:09:15.665 --> 01:09:19.568]  Man, cops almost every day in Denver are almost beating people to death for no reason.
[01:09:19.568 --> 01:09:20.248]  Well, yeah.
[01:09:20.248 --> 01:09:23.811]  Let me give you a little reconnaissance that we had going on yesterday.
[01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:25.172]  We went down to Nancy Pelosi.
[01:09:25.172 --> 01:09:28.034]  Her Highness had a book signing.
[01:09:28.034 --> 01:09:30.556]  And the federal presence was just unbelievable.
[01:09:31.427 --> 01:09:33.889]  Also, you know, they had the officers in blue down there.
[01:09:33.889 --> 01:09:35.170]  They had about 20 of them.
[01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:39.993]  They had about 15 feds with earbuds, you know, shaven heads.
[01:09:39.993 --> 01:09:44.737]  Then we also had another some sort of security crew that I couldn't identify, but they were there as well.
[01:09:44.737 --> 01:09:53.443]  The room that we were in for the book signing was completely rimmed, I kid you not, completely rimmed with security, feds, and police.
[01:09:53.443 --> 01:09:57.946]  They had cops on different levels of the building that we were in.
[01:09:57.946 --> 01:09:58.827]  It's the tattered cover.
[01:09:59.474 --> 01:10:17.119]  They had, uh, we have two... Well, that's why the government staged the terror attacks, because they have to have an excuse to, you know, to act like it's for terrorism, but really it's because they're criminals, they know they're getting ready to do things where people are going to hate them even more, and so that's why they staged the terror attacks.
[01:10:17.119 --> 01:10:19.099]  Well, it was pretty ramped up.
[01:10:19.099 --> 01:10:26.341]  I was myself shocked to see, you know, how many security, feds, and cops were there just for this lady, Nancy Pelosi,
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:32.948]  And then some of our change members tried to ask questions and they were just, you know, summarily escorted out to the street.
[01:10:34.019 --> 01:10:35.821]  Oh, you don't ask questions of a god.
[01:10:35.821 --> 01:10:37.962]  Oh, no, no, absolutely not.
[01:10:37.962 --> 01:10:39.724]  I mean, they can only have rigged questions.
[01:10:39.724 --> 01:10:41.525]  I mean, even cable companies.
[01:10:41.525 --> 01:10:55.357]  Comcast was having some public hearing about restricting what websites you can visit, and basically shutting the web down in their area, and then they paid homeless people to come sit in the audience so that citizens couldn't come into the City Hall.
[01:10:55.357 --> 01:10:57.519]  I mean, this is the type of stuff that's going on now.
[01:10:58.295 --> 01:10:59.516]  And they're not playing games.
[01:10:59.516 --> 01:11:01.357]  They know they're out of control.
[01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:03.419]  They know they're going against our will.
[01:11:03.419 --> 01:11:04.900]  And they're making a move.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.301]  Well, they act like they're having a party.
[01:11:06.301 --> 01:11:07.222]  You know, it's a good time.
[01:11:07.222 --> 01:11:08.663]  It's on our nickel.
[01:11:08.663 --> 01:11:12.846]  So they're just having a good time, you know, ramping up this whole police state act.
[01:11:12.846 --> 01:11:17.669]  Additionally, if you were to come in to listen to her speak, they went through your backpack.
[01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:20.611]  That was, you know, the... Your slave pack.
[01:11:20.611 --> 01:11:22.052]  It goes on the back of a slave.
[01:11:23.061 --> 01:11:26.088]  Yeah, and you know, I was there with Elonoff.
[01:11:26.088 --> 01:11:29.075]  They wouldn't allow any of his cameras in the building.
[01:11:29.075 --> 01:11:32.002]  We had some changers in the group, like Rob and Turtle.
[01:11:33.447 --> 01:11:35.128]  They had, you know, hidden cams.
[01:11:35.128 --> 01:11:37.470]  Hopefully they got some footage out there.
[01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:38.670]  I don't know if they did or not.
[01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:39.531]  I guess we'll see.
[01:11:39.531 --> 01:11:41.692]  Look, you got all the big minions coming in.
[01:11:41.692 --> 01:11:44.574]  All the ringwraiths coming into town.
[01:11:44.574 --> 01:11:49.618]  And so they're going to have their little Darth Vader men, you know, scurrying around acting like the people are evil.
[01:11:49.618 --> 01:11:51.459]  But it's there to suppress free speech.
[01:11:51.459 --> 01:11:52.960]  It's not to protect them physically.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.041]  They know the threat.
[01:11:55.241 --> 01:11:57.982]  It's all about advertising.
[01:11:57.982 --> 01:11:58.883]  Don't protest.
[01:11:58.883 --> 01:12:00.103]  Don't come to events.
[01:12:00.103 --> 01:12:00.904]  Stay in your house.
[01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:02.164]  Watch the television.
[01:12:02.164 --> 01:12:03.365]  Take your flu shot.
[01:12:03.365 --> 01:12:04.005]  Just die.
[01:12:04.005 --> 01:12:04.805]  Just die.
[01:12:04.805 --> 01:12:05.585]  Just die.
[01:12:05.585 --> 01:12:07.026]  Go home and die, America!
[01:12:07.026 --> 01:12:10.127]  And don't let the gods, you can't take their thunder.
[01:12:10.127 --> 01:12:13.289]  They gotta get up there and spew pablum.
[01:12:13.289 --> 01:12:16.330]  When I was listening to Nancy Pelosi, I thought the top of my head was gonna blow off.
[01:12:16.963 --> 01:12:18.145]  Uh, she has no intellect.
[01:12:18.145 --> 01:12:20.289]  I was thumbing through her book, which I did not buy.
[01:12:20.289 --> 01:12:22.373]  And it's just, it's just garbage.
[01:12:22.373 --> 01:12:24.497]  She's just another daughter of a mob boss.
[01:12:24.497 --> 01:12:25.619]  It's, it's, it's who they are.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.681]  That's just who they are.
[01:12:27.681 --> 01:12:42.007]  She's very charming, she puts on a nice front, but totally bought and paid for by the corporateocracy and we just, uh, I was joking to some of the changers saying that I thought I was at a skinhead convention with all the shaved heads in the room with the earbuds.
[01:12:42.007 --> 01:12:46.369]  And they all just got back from Iraq and now they've got a new enemy, the American people.
[01:12:46.369 --> 01:12:49.951]  Well, I look forward to meeting you next week, God bless you, take care.
[01:12:49.951 --> 01:12:53.773]  Let's go ahead now and go to Elliot in Ohio, then Steve, Matt, and others.
[01:12:53.773 --> 01:12:54.533]  Elliot, you're on the air.
[01:12:56.129 --> 01:12:56.829]  Hey, Alex.
[01:12:56.829 --> 01:13:01.411]  Yeah, I got a couple tips for people, like, um, just how to spread the information.
[01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:05.552]  Like, uh, recently I, uh, I haven't gone on my Facebook or my MySpace.
[01:13:05.552 --> 01:13:07.173]  I didn't even create either of them.
[01:13:07.173 --> 01:13:12.615]  My friends thought I needed them, and, but I realized that it could be used as a tool.
[01:13:12.615 --> 01:13:18.477]  I mean, I know, like, I've read how MySpace is the Trojan Horse of the Internet, and as is Facebook.
[01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:23.219]  I mean, stumble upon iGoogle, they're all the same things, but you can create groups on them.
[01:13:23.996 --> 01:13:25.797]  And you can invite people to your group.
[01:13:25.797 --> 01:13:27.578]  So what I did was I made a group.
[01:13:27.578 --> 01:13:29.459]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:13:29.459 --> 01:13:30.840]  That's, like, 102 people.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:37.664]  So far, seven have joined, and I wrote up a little discussion topic.
[01:13:37.664 --> 01:13:39.926]  Two-party system equals one-party system.
[01:13:39.926 --> 01:13:46.130]  And I got a bunch of quotes from CFR members, Carol Quigley and David Rockefeller's memoirs.
[01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:49.112]  Just stuff to get the people, you know, stirred.
[01:13:49.112 --> 01:13:49.772]  You know?
[01:13:49.772 --> 01:13:51.293]  Maybe start thinking about some things.
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:59.843]  And also, the gentleman that you had on just a little bit ago, where I work, like, there is two computers.
[01:13:59.843 --> 01:14:00.803]  I can only use one.
[01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:02.404]  I share it with the manager.
[01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:05.545]  I also just leave InfoWars.com.
[01:14:05.545 --> 01:14:15.289]  Some of the articles that I'm reading, I just leave it up there, and he thinks it's all, you know, craziness, but I just keep doing it to see what could happen.
[01:14:15.289 --> 01:14:15.989]  Also, there's a
[01:14:16.579 --> 01:14:43.335]  A local paper, it's called Street Vibes in Cincinnati, it's for like helping out the homeless because they're the vendors, they sell it, they buy it for a dollar, they get 75 cents on it, and then 25 cents goes to the publishing company, but I called up the editor and he says, I can write for, I mean I wouldn't get paid any money, but he says depending on what I write, like I was saying, would you mind if I talked about the Federal Reserve, the New World Order, the reason why poor people are poor,
[01:14:44.995 --> 01:14:47.217]  And he was like, sure, yeah, just send me some information.
[01:14:47.217 --> 01:14:56.824]  You know, there are a lot of medium-sized papers and even some big ones that will let you write alternative information.
[01:14:56.824 --> 01:15:02.028]  And, you know, there's some distant people in my family that live here in Austin who think vaccines are wonderful.
[01:15:02.028 --> 01:15:06.852]  One of them's a medical doctor, and they let her write big things in the Austin, America, Statesman about how wonderful it is.
[01:15:06.852 --> 01:15:10.074]  But, you know, that's a paper that wants to spew propaganda.
[01:15:10.074 --> 01:15:13.557]  But vice versa, you know, they'll have community leaders write things, you know, that are against it.
[01:15:14.454 --> 01:15:16.440]  Uh, so, absolutely.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.345]  I mean, letters to the editor, all of this.
[01:15:18.345 --> 01:15:21.755]  Just any crack in the enemy's electronic Berlin Wall...
[01:15:22.654 --> 01:15:33.760]  He's great, and remember, people are listening to us like they never have before, and Congress has an 11%, 9%, excuse me, it's gone down, 9% approval rating in the last Gallup poll a few months ago.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.701]  I mean, let Nancy Pelosi spiralize.
[01:15:35.701 --> 01:15:38.543]  Everybody hates her, nobody likes her, nobody likes Bush.
[01:15:38.543 --> 01:15:44.186]  I mean, you may be able to fill a stadium with a bunch of Obama bots, or McCain bots, but I mean, that's...
[01:15:44.546 --> 01:15:50.992]  That's still a minority of Kool-Aid drinking idiots that probably don't even know, you know, basically what country they're in.
[01:15:50.992 --> 01:15:52.613]  I appreciate your call.
[01:15:52.613 --> 01:15:56.396]  Let's go ahead and go to Steve in Denver.
[01:15:56.396 --> 01:15:58.878]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:15:58.878 --> 01:16:01.360]  Thanks a lot, Alex, for everything you've been doing.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.101]  We really appreciate it.
[01:16:02.101 --> 01:16:08.166]  I'm looking forward to meeting you, shaking your hand, looking you square in the eye and telling you how much I appreciate the work you've been doing for everybody.
[01:16:08.166 --> 01:16:10.428]  I know it's kind of tough at times, but hang in there, man.
[01:16:10.428 --> 01:16:12.650]  A lot of stuff going on here, you know.
[01:16:14.545 --> 01:16:15.567]  Sure.
[01:16:15.567 --> 01:16:23.658]  You know, I was hoping to see if we could find a way to motivate some of the people who are already informed to apply some collective pressure on Congress.
[01:16:24.184 --> 01:16:32.846]  Maybe try to get as many as 5 million contacts going in the week of the anniversary of the 7th anniversary of 9-11, demanding a new investigation.
[01:16:32.846 --> 01:16:42.668]  Because you know, Alex, as much as we're doing so many good things to get visibility and inform people, I don't really think we're having any effect on the government inside Capitol Hill.
[01:16:42.668 --> 01:16:43.128]  Are you kidding?
[01:16:43.128 --> 01:16:46.249]  They're having to have missed reports, lying, countering us.
[01:16:47.589 --> 01:16:55.498]  We have violent radicalization acts in Congress trying to talk about restricting free speech and how we're taking over and how dangerous we are and how we're Al-Qaeda.
[01:16:55.498 --> 01:16:58.261]  I mean, ridiculous stuff that only discredits them more.
[01:16:58.261 --> 01:17:00.944]  We're having a huge effect, sir, believe me.
[01:17:00.944 --> 01:17:02.966]  We are having a gigantic effect.
[01:17:03.817 --> 01:17:07.619]  Is there any way we could post each one of these people up on a website?
[01:17:07.619 --> 01:17:19.206]  That's what we're looking at doing right now, and having some serious answers, questions to them posed as to, are you in support of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Federal Reserve Board, the current wars, and the outsourcing of our economy?
[01:17:19.206 --> 01:17:26.210]  You know, there's so many different questions we could ask, but I want to hold these guys accountable before the election comes, Alex, because, you know, the reality is,
[01:17:26.852 --> 01:17:34.056]  I don't think anybody is looking at them personally from the standpoint of the voters and what they represent and holding them.
[01:17:34.056 --> 01:17:34.656]  No, I hear you.
[01:17:34.656 --> 01:17:42.300]  We have a shadow government with a bunch of do-nothing puppets that run nothing now, and I appreciate your call.
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:48.023]  I mean, the key is letting Congress know that we know they're blackmailed and are puppets and the cognitive government's running everything.
[01:17:48.443 --> 01:18:02.786]  That's really the key is exposing the shadow government that staged the terror attacks as a pretext to activate their shadow government and absorb what little left of sovereignty and accountability and elected officials that still had any power.
[01:18:02.786 --> 01:18:05.046]  I mean now we're pretty much under the grid.
[01:18:05.046 --> 01:18:09.787]  There's just some free speech left and now they're moving to shut that down.
[01:18:09.787 --> 01:18:14.708]  But the enemy is very weak during this period because now they are revealing themselves.
[01:18:14.708 --> 01:18:17.089]  Now on the subject, this is key,
[01:18:18.129 --> 01:18:28.742]  On the subject of writing and calling Congress, generally, when you give them millions of phone calls, they just hire more SWAT teams and more police and get more scared because they know we know that they're criminals.
[01:18:29.275 --> 01:18:42.547]  When they see a 9% approval rating and everybody hates them and their lives don't work anymore, they just go, build camps, build, yes, yes, okay, I'm gonna steal more money, protect me, executive branch, I'll be criminal, I've been involved with you, okay, let's go for broke!
[01:18:42.547 --> 01:18:43.188]  Shut them down!
[01:18:43.188 --> 01:18:47.912]  I mean, a lot of members of Congress are like, okay, martial law, fine, just give me power, okay?
[01:18:47.912 --> 01:18:51.936]  You know, don't indict me, don't let them get me, don't let grand juries get me at the states!
[01:18:51.936 --> 01:18:54.098]  We need martial law to protect our criminal activity!
[01:18:56.906 --> 01:18:59.827]  See, as long as they don't have total martial law, they're not invincible.
[01:18:59.827 --> 01:19:00.567]  They can be punished.
[01:19:00.567 --> 01:19:02.928]  They can be brought to justice.
[01:19:02.928 --> 01:19:06.429]  But once the full corporatocracy is in control, they're a lot safer.
[01:19:06.429 --> 01:19:07.289]  They think.
[01:19:07.289 --> 01:19:10.070]  Once they're tracking good to track all of us, they think they're safe.
[01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:16.172]  And all these big Denver events and the rest of it in Minneapolis are police state training grids to practice more of this in the future.
[01:19:16.172 --> 01:19:18.372]  And to get better at suppressing and controlling.
[01:19:18.372 --> 01:19:20.133]  And keeping the slaves away from the demigods.
[01:19:21.824 --> 01:19:30.990]  But it does work when they're about to pass amnesty and they keep it secret to let them know that you're not going to support them in the next election.
[01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:35.353]  But then they race with electronic machines to put them into place to block you from that.
[01:19:35.353 --> 01:19:39.496]  But then it becomes more obvious that no one likes them, no one supports them, but they keep winning.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.261]  You see, so now there's that crisis.
[01:19:42.261 --> 01:19:43.802]  That's why they have to have martial law.
[01:19:43.802 --> 01:19:47.985]  There's that crisis where we're going, well, wait, you got 9% approval rating, but you're winning.
[01:19:47.985 --> 01:19:48.985]  What's going on?
[01:19:48.985 --> 01:19:50.506]  They're like, shut up.
[01:19:50.506 --> 01:19:53.108]  We have officers with weapons.
[01:19:53.108 --> 01:19:53.668]  You understand?
[01:19:53.668 --> 01:19:55.689]  I mean, you know, that's the system we've reached here.
[01:19:55.689 --> 01:19:59.431]  It's that flashpoint when we finally go, oh my God, it really is martial law.
[01:19:59.431 --> 01:20:00.232]  It really is tyranny.
[01:20:00.232 --> 01:20:03.154]  It is a big idea.
[01:20:03.154 --> 01:20:05.235]  A new world order.
[01:20:05.971 --> 01:20:10.876]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[01:20:10.876 --> 01:20:13.699]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:13.699 --> 01:20:16.501]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:20:16.501 --> 01:20:19.684]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:19.684 --> 01:20:27.012]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:30.006 --> 01:20:35.487]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:35.487 --> 01:20:39.328]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:39.328 --> 01:20:41.889]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:41.889 --> 01:20:43.069]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:43.069 --> 01:20:43.849]  They're not after money.
[01:20:43.849 --> 01:20:45.129]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:45.129 --> 01:20:46.109]  They're after power.
[01:20:46.109 --> 01:20:47.270]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:20:58.752 --> 01:21:00.653]  You have been warned.
[01:21:00.653 --> 01:21:01.433]  Gold.
[01:21:01.433 --> 01:21:02.974]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:02.974 --> 01:21:09.257]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:09.257 --> 01:21:13.418]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:13.418 --> 01:21:15.359]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:15.359 --> 01:21:17.800]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:24.143]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets
[01:21:24.343 --> 01:21:24.863]  We're good to go.
[01:21:40.014 --> 01:21:46.598]  As good as gold, call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.

[01:22:00.763 --> 01:22:04.524]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:22:04.524 --> 01:22:09.565]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:22:09.565 --> 01:22:14.986]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:14.986 --> 01:22:25.508]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:26.008 --> 01:22:30.410]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:33.190]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:22:33.190 --> 01:22:36.752]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:22:36.752 --> 01:22:49.256]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:23:06.672 --> 01:23:07.813]  Fat burners.
[01:23:07.813 --> 01:23:09.675]  Life change fat burners.

[01:23:18.304 --> 01:23:19.846]  Maybe you'll be a lion tamer.
[01:23:20.026 --> 01:23:21.927]  Well, maybe not Lion Tamer.

[01:24:12.359 --> 01:24:14.000]  I'm going to go to Matt and Ramey first.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.141]  I want to get to all of you today.
[01:24:15.141 --> 01:24:18.564]  Matt in the UK, you're on the air.
[01:24:18.564 --> 01:24:20.465]  Good afternoon, sir.
[01:24:20.465 --> 01:24:22.186]  Second time caller and long time listener.
[01:24:22.186 --> 01:24:24.448]  Thanks so much for letting me on your show, by the way.
[01:24:24.448 --> 01:24:25.248]  Thanks for calling.
[01:24:25.248 --> 01:24:32.594]  So as I mentioned, regarding yesterday, when you were talking to good old Paul Watson there, regarding about the state of affairs, what's been happening in the UK.
[01:24:33.874 --> 01:24:38.297]  Yeah, I just thought I'd ask actually, what's it like in the US?
[01:24:38.297 --> 01:24:42.519]  Do you have the same type of people that are going through your garbage?
[01:24:55.286 --> 01:25:05.101]  But yes, they're going to create 10 million man brigades, tattletale squads, animal ID, premises ID, harassment forces, just hellish.
[01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:06.483]  Parasites being turned loose.
[01:25:07.196 --> 01:25:09.197]  I just thought I'd mention something.
[01:25:09.197 --> 01:25:11.578]  In my hometown we have a local event, like a beach festival.
[01:25:11.578 --> 01:25:16.761]  It's like a free pop event where unsigned bands come to my hometown.
[01:25:16.761 --> 01:25:29.747]  And it's just amazing how auditorial even my hometown's been now because every year you could be able to take beer and lager or whatever we call it in the UK down to the main beach and you could listen to the free music.
[01:25:29.747 --> 01:25:30.727]  And they've even stopped that now.
[01:25:30.727 --> 01:25:36.310]  They've even put enforcement, they've had that much security at my hometown that it's just become absolutely
[01:25:37.586 --> 01:25:38.688]  Horrendous.
[01:25:38.688 --> 01:25:40.730]  It's all slave training.
[01:25:40.730 --> 01:25:44.895]  It's all... I mean, seeing adults being bossed around like they're children.
[01:25:44.895 --> 01:25:49.341]  It's letting you know you have no dignity, you're a slave.
[01:25:49.341 --> 01:25:52.565]  Yeah, and also, I read in the Daily Mail today, actually,
[01:25:53.075 --> 01:26:00.479]  That in UK schools, and even in my son's primary school in the UK, they've even got CCTV cameras in the actual playground.
[01:26:00.479 --> 01:26:03.280]  And I can't believe that they're even going to put them in the classroom, in the toilet.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:08.963]  I mean, this is absolutely... Yes, and this will all be used against them for petty stuff, to throw the book at them and get them into the system.
[01:26:08.963 --> 01:26:10.304]  I appreciate your call.
[01:26:10.304 --> 01:26:12.065]  Let's talk to Ramey in Oklahoma.
[01:26:12.065 --> 01:26:14.246]  Ramey, welcome.
[01:26:14.246 --> 01:26:14.966]  Hello.
[01:26:14.966 --> 01:26:16.007]  Hi, Ramey.
[01:26:16.007 --> 01:26:17.787]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:17.787 --> 01:26:18.428]  I was just calling.
[01:26:18.428 --> 01:26:21.489]  I'm a nurse in Oklahoma City, in one of the big hospitals.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:29.502]  What they're doing there with their vaccines is almost like forced inoculation.
[01:26:29.502 --> 01:26:39.606]  You go in, you're admitted, and automatically they have on your schedule pneumovacs and flu vaccine, and these poor people don't know, you know?
[01:26:39.606 --> 01:26:42.787]  You go in, you say, okay, you need a shot, here you go.
[01:26:42.787 --> 01:26:44.568]  They're like, okay, you know?
[01:26:44.568 --> 01:26:47.229]  Yeah, they're using the trust and authority of the medical system
[01:26:48.078 --> 01:26:55.120]  And then a lot of places are trying to refuse care if adults haven't had vaccines, and it's because there's trillions of dollars in the drug companies.
[01:26:57.293 --> 01:27:03.038]  They are lobbying, the medical associations, the medical companies, they're paying them bounties to do this.
[01:27:03.038 --> 01:27:06.761]  And the news is announcing it's the law, children have to have them, there's no law.
[01:27:06.761 --> 01:27:09.163]  Again, it's just like Russia didn't attack Georgia.
[01:27:09.163 --> 01:27:12.406]  It's just all giant hoaxes and lies.
[01:27:12.406 --> 01:27:14.548]  That's why we're in so much trouble, folks.
[01:27:14.548 --> 01:27:19.672]  And then they tried to order all the police, firemen, and medical workers, remember five years ago, to take smallpox?
[01:27:19.672 --> 01:27:22.735]  They ordered 14 million first responders and they all said basically no.
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:28.281]  Uh, so, so, uh, and of the 4,000 that did take it, a bunch died.
[01:27:28.281 --> 01:27:31.442]  So, see, they're just bringing this tyranny in.
[01:27:31.442 --> 01:27:31.883]  Yep.
[01:27:31.883 --> 01:27:45.667]  Oh, it's the vaccines that woke me up, because I was pregnant with a son, and after you do so much research and you realize, hey, the government must know about this, you know, then you kind of put two and two together and realize, yeah, they do know.
[01:27:45.667 --> 01:27:48.588]  They just don't want to do anything about it, because it's being done on purpose.
[01:27:49.344 --> 01:28:03.983]  And then you find actual documents from the 20s and 30s where they developed the cancer viruses, they found out most cancer was communicable, and they said, we'll put it in the shots, then we'll own the hospitals, we'll own the cancer systems, the doctors and people below will never know, it's all compartmentalized.
[01:28:04.663 --> 01:28:24.713]  And now there's all these plagues upon us, and it's almost all of it is from the vaccines and GMO food, and now they're saying, oh, the ignorant Africans, they won't, this is in BBC and other publications, they won't take the shots anymore, they run into the woods, and they go, oh, we've engineered potatoes and rice that have the vaccines in them, we'll feed it to them.
[01:28:24.713 --> 01:28:26.434]  Well, see, they're gonna do that to us.
[01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:28.435]  I mean, this is just incredibly dastardly.
[01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:33.499]  Yeah, people are just really brainwashed, especially, you know, the people I work with at the hospital.
[01:28:33.499 --> 01:28:36.205]  You try to, you know, talk to them about stuff and they just...
[01:28:36.832 --> 01:28:37.873]  They act like you're crazy!
[01:28:37.873 --> 01:28:45.376]  Well, that's because they're a good person, and so they can't imagine that they're doing anything wrong.
[01:28:45.376 --> 01:28:50.279]  I mean, at your hospital, whenever they check a woman in, do they sit there and ask her, oh, is everything okay at home?
[01:28:50.279 --> 01:28:51.399]  You got a good family environment?
[01:28:51.399 --> 01:28:53.801]  While they type it into the health department database?
[01:28:53.801 --> 01:28:56.862]  Or does the nurse typing that in even know that's going in a database?
[01:28:56.862 --> 01:28:57.883]  Yes, we know.
[01:28:57.883 --> 01:29:03.666]  And especially, like the old people that come in, you have to check, you know, if you suspect abuse.
[01:29:03.666 --> 01:29:05.346]  Or even if they're not old, just anybody.
[01:29:05.346 --> 01:29:06.427]  Do you suspect abuse?
[01:29:07.034 --> 01:29:12.259]  And then that automatically goes to their database, you know, to investigate.
[01:29:12.259 --> 01:29:25.271]  Yeah, I mean, I go in with my wife to have children, and I go there because I know the doctor, you know, she's a patriot, but the rest of them, and they go, oh, please take this file downstairs, and I go, oh, sure, and I wink at my wife, and then it's, is he hurting you?
[01:29:25.271 --> 01:29:25.832]  Because, again,
[01:29:26.559 --> 01:29:29.700]  They don't even let the woman know, because we want to snatch your baby, hun.
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:32.941]  And then a woman, you know, they might have had a fight two weeks before, it's over.
[01:29:32.941 --> 01:29:37.743]  The child will be with the pedophile rape gangs that day.
[01:29:37.743 --> 01:29:39.283]  That's how America operates.
[01:29:39.283 --> 01:29:41.764]  The evil is just totally ingrained everywhere.
[01:29:41.764 --> 01:29:42.524]  You know, stay there.
[01:29:42.524 --> 01:29:51.807]  I've got a mini guest coming up, but I want to come back to you about this database from others that don't know.
[01:29:51.807 --> 01:29:53.187]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.187 --> 01:29:54.708]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.703 --> 01:30:01.706]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.706 --> 01:30:04.928]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:30:04.928 --> 01:30:08.410]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:08.410 --> 01:30:11.052]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:30:11.052 --> 01:30:12.612]  But who is the enemy?
[01:30:12.612 --> 01:30:13.393]  Bin Laden.
[01:30:13.393 --> 01:30:14.273]  This is his MO.
[01:30:14.273 --> 01:30:15.774]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:30:15.774 --> 01:30:17.335]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:30:17.735 --> 01:30:24.900]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:25.380]  Some U.S.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:31.745]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:30:31.745 --> 01:30:35.187]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:30:35.427 --> 01:30:45.714]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:30:45.714 --> 01:30:46.935]  Fabled enemies.
[01:30:46.935 --> 01:30:54.680]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:58.103]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:31:01.505 --> 01:31:05.208]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:31:05.208 --> 01:31:07.629]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:11.112]  Tonight, I have a date with the very lovely Rachel.
[01:31:11.112 --> 01:31:18.116]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:31:18.116 --> 01:31:20.278]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:31:20.878 --> 01:31:24.240]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:29.122]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:31:29.122 --> 01:31:34.024]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:31:34.024 --> 01:31:36.625]  Travel less, meet online with Webex.
[01:31:36.625 --> 01:31:40.527]  For as little as $59 a month, about the price of a tank of gas.
[01:31:40.527 --> 01:31:43.768]  You can host unlimited meetings every month from your desktop.
[01:31:43.768 --> 01:31:44.829]  Webex from Cisco.
[01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.450]  I think so.
[01:32:01.953 --> 01:32:05.316]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:32:05.316 --> 01:32:13.542]  Did you know that candidates to run for the presidency are selected in advance by ultra-billionaires called Bilderbergers?
[01:32:13.542 --> 01:32:18.126]  They hold private meetings once a year to plan the future for the world.
[01:32:18.126 --> 01:32:21.748]  They invite possible candidates to see if they fit their agenda.
[01:32:22.649 --> 01:32:25.050]  If they don't, they lose.
[01:32:25.050 --> 01:32:29.732]  They also snub any constitutionalists that are fighting world government.
[01:32:29.732 --> 01:32:35.934]  They want to rule the world through economic power, thus the coming Mark of the Beast.
[01:32:35.934 --> 01:32:46.178]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:32:46.178 --> 01:32:47.659]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800,
[01:32:49.445 --> 01:32:49.625]  5-1-6-8-7-3-6.
[01:32:49.625 --> 01:32:50.326]  That's 1-800-5-1-6-8-7-3-6.
[01:32:50.326 --> 01:32:52.367]  Sherry, um, the wife of Steve Schenck,
[01:33:11.909 --> 01:33:36.336]  Got very very sick and then she's been sick for a long time but died recently and that's why you haven't heard Steve on doing his own radio show on this network in the last month or so or on this show and we really appreciate him coming on today because I wanted to get an update on the global food situation and the shortage there
[01:33:37.386 --> 01:33:42.129]  Then coming up in the next hour, Mark Dice with his new edition of the Resistance Manifesto.
[01:33:42.129 --> 01:33:45.952]  Then Professor Frances A. Boyle about how the government launched the bio-attacks.
[01:33:45.952 --> 01:33:50.294]  Very important guest coming up there as well.
[01:33:50.294 --> 01:33:52.556]  But really do appreciate
[01:33:53.681 --> 01:33:54.642]  Well, I appreciate that, Alex.
[01:33:54.642 --> 01:33:56.122]  You're one of the good guys.
[01:34:17.259 --> 01:34:23.084]  Sometimes the condolences hurt more than the thing that we're dealing with.
[01:34:23.084 --> 01:34:24.365]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:34:24.365 --> 01:34:30.090]  Well, the folks have been wondering where you are, so that's why we bring it up, but you're back now.
[01:34:30.090 --> 01:34:30.691]  Yep.
[01:34:30.691 --> 01:34:33.753]  Getting off that subject, I know it's a tough one for you.
[01:34:33.753 --> 01:34:37.697]  Steve, lots happened since you were on with us over a month ago.
[01:34:37.697 --> 01:34:37.917]  I know.
[01:34:39.193 --> 01:34:42.436]  Things have gone really goofy.
[01:34:42.436 --> 01:34:59.151]  One of the things that's happened in the media is that we've had some softening of the concern for the food situation by pointing out the fact that we're going to have a bumper crop and that the impact of the flooding in the Midwest was not as severe as what they thought and all this.
[01:35:00.763 --> 01:35:02.945]  Let me point something out.
[01:35:02.945 --> 01:35:09.771]  And those of you that... I know that a lot of you that are listeners here take notes from time to time.
[01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:13.194]  You might want to take notes on this.
[01:35:13.194 --> 01:35:15.976]  Remember this.
[01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:27.827]  All of the issues with regard to the cost of food are related to investors investing in your sustenance and making huge profits from it.
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.882]  Let's just go down very, very quickly.
[01:35:30.882 --> 01:35:38.289]  I don't want to take a lot of time on this, but just for the sake of you listeners that haven't put their dots together here.
[01:35:38.289 --> 01:35:47.478]  Oil prices, based on the fact that investors are investing in the oil before it gets to you, and that's what keeps the prices up.
[01:35:47.478 --> 01:35:49.720]  Ethanol, the mandate by the U.S.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:52.943]  Congress to take our food and turn it into fuel.
[01:35:53.889 --> 01:35:59.938]  Uh, as inefficient as it is, is based on investors making huge profits on doing that.
[01:35:59.938 --> 01:36:02.162]  Subsidies to farms.
[01:36:02.162 --> 01:36:07.630]  Now, a lot of the farmers are being, you know, I read articles all the time, Alex, about the fact that
[01:36:08.567 --> 01:36:11.089]  That the farmers are making a windfall profit.
[01:36:11.089 --> 01:36:13.711]  That is pure garbage.
[01:36:13.711 --> 01:36:29.984]  The farmers are going out of business as a result of these subsidies that are being paid to large agri-corps and just land investors like Ted Turner and some of those guys have thousands of acres that are being paid subsidies not to grow on what they wouldn't grow on anyway.
[01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:32.305]  And that is boosting food costs.
[01:36:32.305 --> 01:36:35.348]  Investors are investing now in water.
[01:36:36.124 --> 01:36:42.634]  Worldwide, and particularly in the United States, they're buying up water rights land over aquifers.
[01:36:42.634 --> 01:36:48.062]  That, in the state of a worldwide, three-year worldwide famine.
[01:36:48.062 --> 01:36:49.885]  Well, that's what T-Boone's Pickens is doing.
[01:36:49.885 --> 01:36:51.968]  I mean, they're snatching up everything real.
[01:36:53.311 --> 01:36:56.552]  Everything they can get their hands on that's connected with food.
[01:36:56.552 --> 01:37:09.297]  You see, in any marketing situation, Alex, you've got a circumstance where investors look at needs, and the greatest need provides the greatest opportunity to invest.
[01:37:10.097 --> 01:37:24.718]  Food is the greatest basic need that we've got as human beings on this planet, and in a situation where we're in the third year of a worldwide famine, the two most populated countries in the world, India and China,
[01:37:25.659 --> 01:37:50.078]  Just broke off relations with the United States with regard to the negotiations over food Embargoes and and all of the restrictions on Importing exporting of foods because the United States was trying to use our food to control those countries as much as they could and it's not going to work, but the fact is that water
[01:37:50.885 --> 01:37:57.430]  In a famine environment is more precious than gold and all of these investors are investing like crazy.
[01:37:57.430 --> 01:38:04.716]  Mr. Bush, Reverend Moon, and you mentioned Pickens and Buffett.
[01:38:04.716 --> 01:38:11.702]  All of these huge, huge money people are going after water more intently than they ever, ever went after.
[01:38:11.702 --> 01:38:15.144]  He just bought up Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, most of the water.
[01:38:15.144 --> 01:38:17.086]  That's a complete scam.
[01:38:17.904 --> 01:38:32.438]  Well, what we did on our radio program a couple times and on the internet is we tried to put out the message to farmers or ex-farmers or people that own land in the West where it requires irrigation and people have water rights.
[01:38:32.438 --> 01:38:36.142]  Please do not sell to these investors.
[01:38:36.142 --> 01:38:39.365]  Sell to your neighbors, the farmers that are trying to keep things going.
[01:38:40.436 --> 01:38:41.557]  Your water rights.
[01:38:41.557 --> 01:38:49.024]  The problem is, the water issue is just absolutely horrendous in the time of famine.
[01:38:49.024 --> 01:38:53.648]  The last thing is, of course, my pet peeve, commodities investors.
[01:38:53.648 --> 01:38:57.912]  You know, Alex, as well as I do, that the farmers are not making the money.
[01:38:57.912 --> 01:39:05.039]  Investors are going in and buying the food, holding it, and then selling it to foreign nations for cheap American dollars.
[01:39:06.705 --> 01:39:12.291]  But you see, no matter what the reason is that those prices are going up, and you see, it doesn't make any difference.
[01:39:12.291 --> 01:39:18.638]  Well, they just reported, they just reported that inflation is double what the Fed, quote, thought it would be with even their Cook numbers.
[01:39:18.638 --> 01:39:20.760]  It's really about 14, 15 percent.
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:28.248]  But Steve, you're always saying it's horrible food because of prices going up, dollar devaluation.
[01:39:28.248 --> 01:39:29.049]  I just say have it.
[01:39:29.725 --> 01:39:36.710]  As an insurance policy that lasts more than 10 years, because regardless, the world is getting more dangerous, not safer.
[01:39:36.710 --> 01:39:47.937]  And with the crazy stuff with Russia and Georgia and Iran and elections and terrorism and criminal government, I mean, people are crazy if they don't get storable food.
[01:39:48.573 --> 01:39:51.294]  Yeah, they don't have a choice at this point, Alex.
[01:39:51.294 --> 01:39:54.694]  It's just absolutely, there is no choice.
[01:39:54.694 --> 01:39:58.275]  What's happening right now, it doesn't make any difference.
[01:39:58.275 --> 01:40:16.438]  If we had the greatest bumper crop the world has ever seen in every country right now that is starving, if all of a sudden it turned around and by October a miracle happened and we had a huge bumper crop, it would not make one bit of difference to the families in America that right now can't afford food.
[01:40:17.466 --> 01:40:31.537]  And it wouldn't make any difference to the families that tomorrow will not be able to afford food because those prices are going to keep going up, because these investors are not going to stop investing, and that will tie up any excess that they have.
[01:40:31.537 --> 01:40:35.180]  It'll go into the corn ethanol and all of this kind of stuff.
[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:37.362]  So the cast is set.
[01:40:37.962 --> 01:40:53.399]  But really, very simply, you know as well as I do, Alex, that before, up until about six months ago, we were talking always about preparing for the future, having it, you know, having two, three, four years ahead for when things got really goofy.
[01:40:53.399 --> 01:40:57.624]  Well, things are really goofy, and now what we're talking about is telling people,
[01:40:58.576 --> 01:41:20.319]  The average housewife right now that barely can afford, working full-time to help her husband earn enough money to pay for the gas and the food, is in a situation where she literally, if they will get involved with this low-moisture, high-nutrition, bulk food and start using it, they literally can buy
[01:41:20.979 --> 01:41:25.743]  They're food for this year at half the cost of last year's food.
[01:41:25.743 --> 01:41:35.009]  So you're saying even get freeze-dried food now and eat it, because it's so inexpensive compared to what's in the store, that then you can save money?
[01:41:35.009 --> 01:41:38.191]  It's half the cost of last year's groceries, Alex.
[01:41:38.191 --> 01:41:40.973]  Half the cost of last year's groceries.
[01:41:40.973 --> 01:41:47.058]  And the main thing that people can do by doing that, I get emails all the time.
[01:41:47.893 --> 01:41:50.775]  About families that right now can't afford the groceries.
[01:41:50.775 --> 01:41:56.599]  And they say, we believe what Alex is saying, we believe what you're saying, but what do we do?
[01:41:56.599 --> 01:41:59.641]  We can't afford food now, let alone put it ahead.
[01:41:59.641 --> 01:42:10.549]  If they will get involved in using this, they can save enough to actually provide for their family right now, and also buy some ahead while it's still available.
[01:42:10.549 --> 01:42:12.170]  Steve, let me ask you a question.
[01:42:12.170 --> 01:42:12.610]  Yeah.
[01:42:12.610 --> 01:42:16.153]  I've seen stories about Costco only letting you buy one thing or rise through Walmart.
[01:42:16.843 --> 01:42:20.725]  I mean, are they really running out of rice?
[01:42:20.725 --> 01:42:28.490]  Well, very simply, that rationing is the result of the food that is being shipped out of the country.
[01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:33.233]  You see, just because our farmers are growing rice doesn't mean that it stays here.
[01:42:34.199 --> 01:42:45.925]  It used to be illegal for anybody to, not illegal, but it wasn't allowed for people that didn't have a use for the rice to buy up huge quantities of it.
[01:42:45.925 --> 01:42:51.568]  It had to be a milling company or a food processing company that could actually take delivery.
[01:42:51.568 --> 01:43:02.354]  They've opened that up so anybody can buy it, and then they buy it and then brag about the fact that they're going to wait until it doubles in price in the world market and then sell it to whoever the highest bidder is that takes it right out of the country.
[01:43:03.394 --> 01:43:06.916]  And so, we have no reserve anymore, Alex.
[01:43:06.916 --> 01:43:08.936]  We have no reserve of wheat.
[01:43:08.936 --> 01:43:10.437]  That's the basis.
[01:43:10.437 --> 01:43:16.420]  Our poor people eat Top Ramen and noodles and spaghetti and things like that.
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:18.801]  That's made from wheat flour.
[01:43:18.801 --> 01:43:24.603]  When they ration wheat flour, rice, rice worldwide is short by 70%.
[01:43:24.603 --> 01:43:27.805]  Here's an example.
[01:43:27.805 --> 01:43:30.886]  A couple months ago, I went to Mangia Pizza.
[01:43:30.886 --> 01:43:31.006]  Uh-huh.
[01:43:32.054 --> 01:43:40.437]  And it said our prices have gone up 25% or something on the wall as a sign because our flour cost has doubled.
[01:43:40.437 --> 01:43:45.218]  And now I've seen similar signs in other restaurants, so it's really happening.
[01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:56.521]  Do you know that the coating on Kentucky Fried Chicken, you know, the seasoned flour base that they put on it, is four times what it was last year at this time?
[01:43:56.521 --> 01:44:00.283]  I went into a Kentucky Fried Chicken and all of a sudden to get one of these big buckets, it's $42.
[01:44:03.484 --> 01:44:03.825]  $42.
[01:44:03.825 --> 01:44:05.906]  And I said, what happened?
[01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:18.677]  You know, it used to be in the teens, they said, hey, the cost of the seasoned flour that we get from our warehouse in Kentucky Fried Chicken has gone up four times, 400%.
[01:44:18.677 --> 01:44:22.199]  It's just, and it's constantly going up.
[01:44:22.199 --> 01:44:27.624]  Now, we've had a little bit of a break in terms of the fuel situation.
[01:44:27.624 --> 01:44:31.407]  A lot of states, the cost of fuel
[01:44:32.375 --> 01:44:32.535]  I think?
[01:44:51.121 --> 01:44:54.583]  At the same time, the farmers that are raising the meat... Now, the U.S.
[01:44:54.583 --> 01:45:12.174]  Department of Agriculture just came out with a statement that meat and poultry are going to be very, very cost... well, their cost is going to go up tremendously within this next year.
[01:45:12.174 --> 01:45:13.375]  And the reason for that
[01:45:14.062 --> 01:45:14.562]  I think so.
[01:45:32.947 --> 01:45:38.290]  They have, you know him well, they have taken over the Beef Association ten years ago.
[01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:40.271]  Everything's run by the big agribusiness.
[01:45:40.271 --> 01:45:47.854]  They're waging a war right now to drive down cattle prices while they're actually going to get record prices when it actually gets to the store.
[01:45:47.854 --> 01:45:50.455]  So it's a huge consolidation happening.
[01:45:50.455 --> 01:45:52.016]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:45:52.016 --> 01:45:58.339]  The farmers that are producing our food are just being squeezed out of the picture completely.
[01:45:58.339 --> 01:45:59.720]  And so the only hope
[01:46:00.475 --> 01:46:01.616]  That a family has.
[01:46:01.616 --> 01:46:04.938]  You know, we talk about they.
[01:46:04.938 --> 01:46:08.360]  A lot of families think, well, they won't let this happen.
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:09.121]  They won't.
[01:46:09.121 --> 01:46:10.422]  They will fix it.
[01:46:10.422 --> 01:46:12.483]  They will have to do something.
[01:46:12.483 --> 01:46:22.750]  Why on earth would anybody with half a brain think that they will fix a problem that they intentionally created that's profitable to them?
[01:46:22.750 --> 01:46:24.811]  It ain't gonna happen, Alex.
[01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:26.632]  It ain't gonna happen.
[01:46:26.632 --> 01:46:29.214]  So what has to happen is that
[01:46:30.442 --> 01:46:41.189]  The people like you, and like me, and the other families out there, are going to have to take control of their life situation.
[01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:43.390]  Food is life.
[01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:54.918]  And so, any of you that are in a situation where you can still afford to set aside a little bit, or have some assets that aren't being totally eaten up just by your very existence,
[01:46:55.715 --> 01:47:03.417]  Please, whether you work with JMS or eFoods Direct, or whether you work with somebody else, I don't care.
[01:47:03.417 --> 01:47:05.378]  You've got to get food in.
[01:47:05.378 --> 01:47:10.899]  The best food to get in is not freeze-dried, is not canned.
[01:47:10.899 --> 01:47:23.303]  The best food is low-moisture, high-nutrition, bulk foods that you can buy at half the cost of last year's groceries, and you start living on that right now.
[01:47:23.943 --> 01:47:43.036]  And then, in addition to that, you buy as much ahead as fast as you can because every single family in this country, at some point in the very near future, will get to the point where they can only afford their bare groceries, and then after that, many families already are in a situation where they can afford to buy food right now.
[01:47:43.036 --> 01:47:44.197]  I get emails all the time.
[01:47:46.438 --> 01:47:54.241]  No, I hope things aren't this bad, but regardless, people really should get prepared and take control of their lives, not let the criminal government have control of their lives.
[01:47:54.241 --> 01:47:55.542]  Now you've got a free brochure.
[01:47:56.716 --> 01:47:58.417]  We've also got a free audio CD.
[01:47:58.417 --> 01:48:00.739]  People have been calling it, but they shouldn't wait.
[01:48:00.739 --> 01:48:02.920]  I like those little two-month supply boogie packs.
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.562]  I've got some of those at the office.
[01:48:04.562 --> 01:48:10.426]  And as you know, I've bought, what is it, four one-year supplies from you, but then I gave part of it to family.
[01:48:10.426 --> 01:48:15.629]  And, you know, I frankly should have more, but the bottom line here is this lasts more than 10 years in climate control.
[01:48:15.629 --> 01:48:17.811]  10 years in non-climate control.
[01:48:19.028 --> 01:48:19.409]  It is.
[01:48:19.409 --> 01:48:20.190]  What's the right word?
[01:48:20.190 --> 01:48:21.792]  Dehydrated.
[01:48:21.792 --> 01:48:24.176]  And it's just really high quality food.
[01:48:24.176 --> 01:48:29.524]  You're the longest continually operating company in the nation and you're also a sponsor and make this show possible.
[01:48:29.524 --> 01:48:32.728]  So we just appreciate you, Steve.
[01:48:32.728 --> 01:48:33.710]  Give folks the phone number.
[01:48:33.710 --> 01:48:34.431]  Give them the website.
[01:48:35.171 --> 01:48:53.420]  Okay, it's 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, and some sweet little Arkansas gals will answer that telephone and get you hooked up to get a packet of information, those of you that aren't computer capable.
[01:48:54.272 --> 01:49:02.579]  You'll have a packet of information with the CDs of some of the lectures where I, you know, I'm screaming and hollering, making a fool of myself, but that's okay.
[01:49:02.579 --> 01:49:20.715]  And on efoodsdirect.com, you can listen to things, and right now we have catalogued, we have catalogued over 200 articles on just what's happening that will support what Alex keeps telling you guys, and what the message that we try to get across.
[01:49:21.488 --> 01:49:25.529]  This is not a marketing operation anymore, is it, Alex?
[01:49:25.529 --> 01:49:27.170]  It's just a survival operation.
[01:49:27.170 --> 01:49:28.930]  We're trying to save lives, for Pete's sake.
[01:49:28.930 --> 01:49:30.971]  Well, I mean, I think it's important for people to have affordable food.
[01:49:30.971 --> 01:49:40.054]  I hope things aren't as bad as what some of the media is saying, but regardless, I believe in this, and this is what I do, and I know you're the top flight company, so people call you.
[01:49:40.054 --> 01:49:41.094]  Give them the number again, Steve.
[01:49:41.674 --> 01:49:44.575]  It's 800-409-5633 and on the web it's efoodsdirect.com.
[01:49:44.575 --> 01:49:46.136]  Now give that number out slowly.
[01:49:46.136 --> 01:49:46.236]  800-409-5633.
[01:49:46.236 --> 01:49:47.877]  Or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:49:47.877 --> 01:49:50.898]  There's big banners up on the top of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and just the
[01:50:06.164 --> 01:50:07.664]  Action of empowering yourself.
[01:50:07.664 --> 01:50:08.765]  They got water filters.
[01:50:08.765 --> 01:50:10.125]  They got survival packs.
[01:50:10.125 --> 01:50:11.285]  They got these little stoves.
[01:50:11.285 --> 01:50:13.186]  It all comes in one package with the food.
[01:50:13.186 --> 01:50:14.246]  Super cheap.
[01:50:14.246 --> 01:50:15.487]  You know, really high quality.
[01:50:15.487 --> 01:50:16.647]  It's just a great outfit.
[01:50:16.647 --> 01:50:19.308]  That's why they've been around 27 years.
[01:50:19.308 --> 01:50:25.469]  And I think they're the place to get your storable food if you think that's something that's important for you to do in these uncertain times.
[01:50:25.469 --> 01:50:27.270]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:28.590]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:50:28.590 --> 01:50:32.291]  Big banners at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:32.911 --> 01:50:38.052]  Steve Shank, thank you for spending so much time with us, and thank you for letting us drag you back on air.
[01:50:38.052 --> 01:50:51.156]  We've been trying to get you on the last few weeks, but we know your wife just died, so we're kind of guilty even dragging you on here, like Ron Paul dragging him on at the hospital with his wife Carol yesterday, but just God bless you and God bless Sherry, my friend.
[01:50:51.156 --> 01:50:52.916]  Hey, bless you too, my friend.
[01:50:52.916 --> 01:50:54.397]  All right, there goes Steve Shank.
[01:50:54.397 --> 01:50:57.378]  Eatfooddirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:50:57.378 --> 01:50:58.738]  The name in storable foods.
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:04.062]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:51:04.062 --> 01:51:11.027]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:51:11.027 --> 01:51:19.413]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:51:19.413 --> 01:51:25.138]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:51:25.458 --> 01:51:25.858]  I don't know.
[01:51:43.652 --> 01:51:45.034]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[01:52:07.056 --> 01:52:08.537]  9-11 was an inside job!
[01:52:08.537 --> 01:52:10.099]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:10.099 --> 01:52:11.820]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:14.703]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:14.703 --> 01:52:19.768]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:52:19.768 --> 01:52:28.015]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:52:28.015 --> 01:52:32.840]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:40.748 --> 01:52:44.191]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:44.191 --> 01:52:47.054]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:47.054 --> 01:52:53.539]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:52:53.539 --> 01:52:56.381]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:52:56.381 --> 01:52:58.643]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:52:58.643 --> 01:53:01.125]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:53:02.057 --> 01:53:07.761]  I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business, when one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned.
[01:53:07.761 --> 01:53:10.583]  He says, wow, have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[01:53:10.583 --> 01:53:11.744]  I said, oh, of course.
[01:53:11.744 --> 01:53:12.965]  Woo, they're high.
[01:53:12.965 --> 01:53:13.445]  He says, yeah.
[01:53:13.445 --> 01:53:14.566]  He says, what am I going to do?
[01:53:14.566 --> 01:53:15.146]  I've got a truck.
[01:53:15.146 --> 01:53:18.068]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[01:53:18.068 --> 01:53:19.970]  I really need the truck for my job.
[01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:21.971]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[01:53:21.971 --> 01:53:24.213]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[01:53:24.213 --> 01:53:25.894]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[01:53:25.894 --> 01:53:26.995]  I don't know what to do.
[01:53:26.995 --> 01:53:28.055]  I said, Bob, relax.
[01:53:28.055 --> 01:53:28.696]  I know what to do.
[01:53:29.276 --> 01:53:33.580]  Call eFoodsDirect.com or go up on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:44.130]  They will deliver food, really good, high-quality, nutritional, delicious food to your door, your door now, right there in front of your house, for about half the price that you were paying for groceries last year.
[01:53:44.130 --> 01:53:51.717]  You can take the savings from that, offset the cost of your fuel, and use it to buy more inexpensive food to hedge against tomorrow's increasing food prices.
[01:53:51.957 --> 01:53:53.160]  Why don't you do that, Bob?
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:54.183]  He said, eFoodsDirect.com?
[01:53:54.183 --> 01:53:55.145]  I said, yep, call them at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:53:55.145 --> 01:53:55.466]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:53:55.466 --> 01:53:55.727]  Do it now.
[01:54:07.927 --> 01:54:12.652]  We're going to have him in later in the next hour going over that.
[01:54:12.652 --> 01:54:17.978]  He's in there studying it right now and boy is it a load of baloney.
[01:54:31.556 --> 01:54:34.819]  You know, how the towers in Building 7 supposedly fell.
[01:54:34.819 --> 01:54:36.720]  So, we're going to be going over that.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:37.701]  But I want to get that lady back on.
[01:54:37.701 --> 01:54:41.965]  He says he's a nurse, uh, up in, uh, Arkansas.
[01:54:41.965 --> 01:54:49.331]  Now, I already know this, and I've already experienced it, and I know it's a fact, but it's good to hear it from a nurse about how you go into a hospital, it's a prison.
[01:54:49.331 --> 01:54:52.433]  You're being surveilled, you're being set up, you're being entrapped.
[01:54:52.433 --> 01:54:54.495]  They want your children.
[01:54:54.495 --> 01:54:55.996]  Does that mean the doctors and nurses are evil?
[01:54:55.996 --> 01:54:59.479]  No, it's just a compartmentalized culture that they've incrementally turned up.
[01:55:00.194 --> 01:55:00.854]  So that's coming up.
[01:55:00.854 --> 01:55:05.076]  But for this segment and part of the next, I bring you Ted Anderson.
[01:55:05.076 --> 01:55:06.657]  Yes, we're having some of the sponsors on.
[01:55:06.657 --> 01:55:08.418]  Haven't had them on in about a month.
[01:55:08.418 --> 01:55:12.280]  Haven't had Daniel Stevens' group in more than a month.
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:17.122]  And I wanted to have Ted on because there are shortages in gold and silver.
[01:55:17.122 --> 01:55:18.563]  It's all over mainstream news.
[01:55:19.517 --> 01:55:40.614]  But it dropped and then we know the big central banks went in and pounded it and tried to drive it down but now it's going back up silver and gold going back up quite a bit today and they told you oh that's it for gold forever just like they said last summer at the end of the summer it goes down the fall starts it goes right back up uh and to see it as high as it was this summer portends really high at least in the past
[01:55:42.911 --> 01:55:57.357]  For this winter, for this fall and winter, and then you've got all the fundamentals of inflation only increasing at record levels, that's AP headline, dollar devaluation, currency devaluation, that the Fed is only intensifying.
[01:55:57.357 --> 01:56:05.080]  So I wanted to have Ted up with the gold and silver shortages, and even though shortages are going, it's been months since he could even get silver dollars that were reasonable.
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:11.683]  I mean, they were always like $28, $29 a piece, and then, because you also have collector value, well, Ted finally got some.
[01:56:12.489 --> 01:56:15.111]  At a reasonable price, and he's got them right now today.
[01:56:15.111 --> 01:56:18.532]  But Ted, tell us about the Kitco news and other news.
[01:56:18.532 --> 01:56:26.937]  Oh yeah, Kitco right now, as the very front page is talking about the demand for their bullion products is so high that right now they've delayed deliveries on everything.
[01:56:26.937 --> 01:56:32.820]  Matter of fact, they're even going to charge a fee if you try to break the trade with them if you can't get it quick enough.
[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:35.582]  Also, right now, Reuters is a headline out there.
[01:56:35.582 --> 01:56:37.823]  American Eagle gold coins are gone.
[01:56:37.823 --> 01:56:39.144]  Not available in the marketplace.
[01:56:39.144 --> 01:56:40.725]  I can't believe that gold coin is gone.
[01:56:40.865 --> 01:56:43.186]  Let's talk about free market here, supply and demand.
[01:56:43.186 --> 01:56:49.390]  Everyone's grabbing gold, snatching it with both hands and silver greedily, because people are smart worldwide.
[01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:52.932]  Gold purchasing is at record levels, but gold has been dropping.
[01:56:52.932 --> 01:56:53.652]  I mean, come on.
[01:56:53.652 --> 01:56:55.293]  Well, that's a manipulation.
[01:56:55.293 --> 01:56:55.833]  We know that.
[01:56:55.833 --> 01:56:57.074]  It's like a rubber band right now.
[01:56:57.074 --> 01:56:59.595]  I can't wait to see what happens when it cracks loose here.
[01:56:59.595 --> 01:57:02.177]  It's going to fling up to the other end.
[01:57:02.177 --> 01:57:03.457]  The IMF chief
[01:57:04.798 --> 01:57:10.480]  Talked about how the United States banks, I mean high-profile banks, are going to be failing.
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:12.922]  He says that the worst is yet to come.
[01:57:12.922 --> 01:57:14.222]  We haven't even seen the worst.
[01:57:14.222 --> 01:57:15.803]  Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, go ahead.
[01:57:15.803 --> 01:57:17.483]  I mean, that's what's going on right now.
[01:57:17.483 --> 01:57:23.946]  I mean, we've seen like the countrywide and all this other stuff fall apart here in the last few months, but the worst is yet to come.
[01:57:23.946 --> 01:57:30.469]  That means the Wells Fargos, the Chase Manhattan, the Citicorps, those guys are having... Bank of America's in trouble.
[01:57:30.509 --> 01:57:32.030]  Yeah, all of that stuff.
[01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:34.871]  And it's right knocking on our door right now.
[01:57:34.871 --> 01:57:37.032]  Yes, gold and silver is going up, obviously.
[01:57:37.032 --> 01:57:40.534]  They've manipulated the futures market, not the physicals.
[01:57:40.534 --> 01:57:42.115]  Nobody wants to sell the physicals.
[01:57:42.115 --> 01:57:43.635]  There's not enough supply.
[01:57:43.635 --> 01:57:44.976]  You're right about the silver dollars.
[01:57:44.976 --> 01:57:45.356]  They're $28 apiece.
[01:57:47.037 --> 01:57:49.838]  They did come back with silver down to 21.
[01:57:49.838 --> 01:57:52.238]  I picked up a bunch of them for $18.70.
[01:57:52.238 --> 01:57:58.999]  And this little group of silver dollars were bought when silver was, you know, right at $13.
[01:57:58.999 --> 01:58:01.180]  Now we're almost $14 an ounce silver.
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:03.680]  This stuff is going to go up like crazy.
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:08.341]  And so I'm, right now, I can't say that there's a better buy in the marketplace.
[01:58:08.341 --> 01:58:11.842]  Those silver dollars, Alex, I couldn't get supply in the spring.
[01:58:11.842 --> 01:58:13.502]  $18.70 is a great price for silver dollars.
[01:58:16.543 --> 01:58:18.844]  So you're selling them for what you bought them?
[01:58:18.844 --> 01:58:24.787]  Yeah, right now at this particular time it's, you know, silver, well silver right now is $14.
[01:58:24.787 --> 01:58:25.388]  Silver dollars is $18.
[01:58:25.388 --> 01:58:27.169]  I mean, they're normally $21.
[01:58:27.169 --> 01:58:29.370]  That's what I'm carrying them for.
[01:58:29.370 --> 01:58:33.532]  So yeah, right now this price is just... Yeah, but you're doing the math there, Ted.
[01:58:33.532 --> 01:58:34.012]  Yeah.
[01:58:34.012 --> 01:58:36.853]  I mean, understand folks, the silver dollars are more than what spot silver is.
[01:58:36.853 --> 01:58:38.854]  Ted is selling them to you for what he's getting them for.
[01:58:38.854 --> 01:58:39.635]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:43.112 --> 01:58:46.514]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.817 --> 01:58:55.039]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:58:55.039 --> 01:58:58.521]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:58.521 --> 01:59:01.162]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:59:01.162 --> 01:59:02.723]  But who is the enemy?
[01:59:02.723 --> 01:59:03.504]  Bin Laden.
[01:59:03.504 --> 01:59:04.344]  This is his MO.
[01:59:04.344 --> 01:59:05.885]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:59:05.885 --> 01:59:07.426]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:59:07.866 --> 01:59:15.014]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:15.014 --> 01:59:15.495]  Some U.S.
[01:59:15.495 --> 01:59:21.842]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:21.842 --> 01:59:25.306]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:25.546 --> 01:59:35.816]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:59:35.816 --> 01:59:37.057]  Fabled enemies.

[01:59:54.227 --> 01:59:56.635]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.635 --> 01:59:59.404]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.019 --> 02:00:10.841]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.841 --> 02:00:12.422]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.422 --> 02:00:13.282]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.282 --> 02:00:18.164]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.164 --> 02:00:22.486]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.486 --> 02:00:27.588]  Alright, we're reporting on what's happening in the metals market with those commodities.
[02:00:27.588 --> 02:00:28.569]  Mark Dice coming up.
[02:00:28.569 --> 02:00:31.510]  We're gonna pop in with the nurse about how you're spot on when you go to the hospital.
[02:00:34.054 --> 02:00:36.413]  Burma's is popping in later in the hour with a NIST report.
[02:00:37.674 --> 02:00:41.535]  The supposed final one, which is another draft, they say, with doublespeak.
[02:00:41.535 --> 02:00:44.316]  And we have a huge expert on the anthrax attacks coming on.
[02:00:44.316 --> 02:00:46.456]  Big guest in the fourth hour.
[02:00:46.456 --> 02:00:49.717]  Ted, continue with the gold and silver offer you have.
[02:00:49.717 --> 02:00:51.858]  Well, yeah, I mean, here's what I'm talking about.
[02:00:51.858 --> 02:00:53.958]  You said, is there any margin of profit in there?
[02:00:53.958 --> 02:00:55.399]  There's a little tiny bit in there.
[02:00:55.399 --> 02:00:58.219]  That's why I wouldn't say no, I'm not selling them for exactly what I paid.
[02:00:58.219 --> 02:00:59.080]  What is it, 70 cents?
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:00.340]  Yeah, I mean, it's nothing.
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:02.901]  But, you know, here's the thing.
[02:01:04.341 --> 02:01:12.746]  The silver dollars, if you didn't call in and say, this is the Alex Jones Special, my silver dollars are marked right now at $21 apiece.
[02:01:12.746 --> 02:01:14.507]  And good luck getting them elsewhere for that!
[02:01:14.507 --> 02:01:17.228]  And that's a fair price for them, it really is, honestly.
[02:01:17.228 --> 02:01:30.676]  And this $18.70, I was able to go into one of my wholesalers, okay, fine, I'll sell you these bags, and I was able to just get them at a blowout price, and it dropped the price down quite a bit for everybody to get involved in.
[02:01:31.016 --> 02:01:43.266]  I mean, everybody should right now take advantage of $13 silver, because silver right now is almost $14, and obviously with the manipulation going on and when this thing springs back, we're going to see $18 to $22 silver again.
[02:01:43.266 --> 02:01:45.328]  Ted, you're never, say, dead on.
[02:01:45.328 --> 02:01:46.028]  You're never sure.
[02:01:46.028 --> 02:01:46.749]  You're sure, huh?
[02:01:47.069 --> 02:01:51.912]  Oh, I, you know, Alex, I'm watching what's going on in the economy and all this other stuff.
[02:01:51.912 --> 02:01:55.054]  I mean, I can't tell you that this is going to happen today or tomorrow.
[02:01:55.054 --> 02:01:59.037]  But I'm telling you right now, major, major banks are going to be failing.
[02:01:59.037 --> 02:02:01.018]  The Federal Reserve System is going to be failing.
[02:02:01.018 --> 02:02:01.298]  No, I know.
[02:02:01.298 --> 02:02:07.282]  I mean, I've been having you on for about 10, 11 years, and I've never heard you this sure.
[02:02:07.282 --> 02:02:09.204]  And I mean, look at all the inflation.
[02:02:10.024 --> 02:02:13.265]  I mean, look at how the gold and silver is running out, and they can't hold it down.
[02:02:13.265 --> 02:02:15.085]  I agree with you.
[02:02:15.085 --> 02:02:17.446]  I just... Well, you can buy on a dip like this.
[02:02:17.446 --> 02:02:23.487]  I mean, usually, you're never quite sure because, you know, silver's at $18, it just rose from $16.
[02:02:23.487 --> 02:02:25.547]  There always can be a correction.
[02:02:25.547 --> 02:02:27.968]  But this thing is ridiculous, what they did here.
[02:02:27.968 --> 02:02:29.408]  And they pushed it down too far.
[02:02:29.408 --> 02:02:31.709]  The dollar's dropping again right now.
[02:02:31.709 --> 02:02:36.150]  The head of the IMF bank is saying that there's worse trouble coming than what we've seen in the past.
[02:02:36.150 --> 02:02:37.050]  They're saying depression.
[02:02:37.330 --> 02:02:40.694]  Yeah, I mean, what do you need to have in the handwritings on the wall?
[02:02:40.694 --> 02:02:41.555]  What about a gold offer?
[02:02:41.555 --> 02:02:42.216]  You got a gold offer?
[02:02:42.216 --> 02:02:46.221]  Oh yeah, right now we still have those francs and they're currently right now at $183.
[02:02:46.221 --> 02:02:48.363]  We have the British Sovereigns, they're at $229.
[02:02:48.363 --> 02:02:51.126]  Those things are a fabulous buy as well.
[02:02:51.126 --> 02:02:54.811]  It just happens to be that the silver thing that we got is just, it's out of this world.
[02:02:55.371 --> 02:03:02.556]  Let's be clear, you just type in gold and silver shortages into Google and click news, you'll see what Ted's talking about.
[02:03:02.556 --> 02:03:03.996]  This is going on 1-800-686-2237, 1-800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[02:03:03.996 --> 02:03:08.559]  There's also some online offers with the banners on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or MidasResources.com, GCNLive.com, 800-686-2237.
[02:03:24.929 --> 02:03:28.270]  2237, brokers are standing by, they'll be there to what, 10 o'clock tonight?
[02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:38.793]  Oh yeah, they'll be here taking your orders all night long, and I tell you, make sure you mention the Alex Jones offer, because you will not buy these silver dollars at this price if you don't.
[02:03:38.793 --> 02:03:48.456]  I mean, it really is a good buy, and again, I mean, if Kitco, I mean, one of the major dealers, I mean, just look up Reuters and the story that they have out there.
[02:03:48.456 --> 02:03:49.576]  I mean, right now, U.S.
[02:03:49.576 --> 02:03:51.276]  Eagles are sold out.
[02:03:51.276 --> 02:03:53.217]  Silver Eagles have been sold out for quite a time.
[02:03:53.297 --> 02:03:58.001]  Hey, we have that financial news section now, sponsored by Minus, on InfoWars.
[02:03:58.001 --> 02:04:06.287]  Why don't you IM those to Kurt Nemo, make sure those get up there with the great job he's doing, so people can go to that one place on InfoWars.com and see those as well.
[02:04:06.287 --> 02:04:09.350]  Or I bet those are, are those stories going to be posted at GCNLive.com?
[02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:13.573]  Yeah, I'm going to give it to Kristen so we can get those up there too, so people can actually go in and see this stuff.
[02:04:13.573 --> 02:04:17.356]  I mean, when you see the Times, the New York Times is talking about the IMF.
[02:04:17.356 --> 02:04:17.956]  I mean, come on.
[02:04:17.956 --> 02:04:18.016]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:04:22.090 --> 02:04:22.511]  1-800-686-237.
[02:04:22.511 --> 02:04:27.177]  Hey, Ted, you just got married and your son just left for the Army.
[02:04:27.177 --> 02:04:28.899]  You've been a busy bee.
[02:04:28.899 --> 02:04:31.924]  Oh, I've been, uh, my world has been turned upside down.
[02:04:31.924 --> 02:04:36.410]  I mean, I was real nervous about my son going into the Army and almost that nervous about getting married, too.
[02:04:38.272 --> 02:04:45.099]  I called Ted up the other day and didn't know he was at the recruiter about to put him in the bus to leave, and Ted started breaking up right before I said bye.
[02:04:45.099 --> 02:04:46.361]  You were starting to cry, weren't you, Ted?
[02:04:46.361 --> 02:04:49.164]  Well, very rare that I cry, but yeah, that was one of those moments.
[02:04:49.164 --> 02:04:52.347]  What can you say, you know?
[02:04:52.347 --> 02:04:52.647]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:52.647 --> 02:04:54.329]  Ted, thanks for the offer.
[02:04:54.329 --> 02:04:55.130]  Yeah, you bet.
[02:04:55.130 --> 02:04:55.550]  And the news.
[02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:56.671]  We'll be right back.

[02:07:07.938 --> 02:07:10.579]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[02:07:10.579 --> 02:07:14.242]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[02:07:14.242 --> 02:07:25.469]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.

[02:07:44.315 --> 02:07:49.419]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:49.419 --> 02:07:51.100]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:11.886 --> 02:08:37.026]  To intimidate and terrorize the thousands of people they plan to cram inside the secret FEMA camp that we exposed in Denver, they have removed the big signs that say electroshock devices in use, and they've taken down the razor wire on top of the tall 12-foot fences they have inside the warehouse.
[02:08:37.026 --> 02:08:38.087]  Well, at the Austin camp,
[02:08:38.996 --> 02:08:40.097]  Pure 57, they didn't.
[02:08:40.097 --> 02:08:43.740]  So, a kindler, gentler, secret camp.
[02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:46.902]  And I love how the Denver Police lied about its existence at first.
[02:08:46.902 --> 02:08:49.164]  I mean, even if you're for these camps, you shouldn't lie about it.
[02:08:49.164 --> 02:08:51.546]  Mark Dice is almost at about three minutes for the rest of the hour.
[02:08:51.546 --> 02:08:56.370]  Uh, then top professor, bioweapons expert, chemical weapons expert.
[02:08:56.370 --> 02:08:57.331]  He's written U.S.
[02:08:57.331 --> 02:08:58.572]  weapons conventions, U.N.
[02:08:58.572 --> 02:08:59.753]  weapons conventions.
[02:08:59.753 --> 02:09:04.176]  He said years ago on this show, and it got picked up internationally, that the anthrax attacks were an inside job.
[02:09:04.176 --> 02:09:06.158]  We'll get his latest analysis with the new info.
[02:09:06.998 --> 02:09:09.060]  Uh, that cover-up's just imploding for them.
[02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:11.981]  Even mainstream news is saying the FBI's covering up.
[02:09:11.981 --> 02:09:14.263]  I mean, no one's buying what the New World Order's selling.
[02:09:14.263 --> 02:09:22.468]  Uh, Raimi, we had to cut her off because we had a guest on earlier, and I wanted her to be able to finish up before we go to Mark Dice.
[02:09:22.468 --> 02:09:27.771]  Again, I have had my three children in a local hospital because I know the doctor, she's a Patriot fan of the show, and...
[02:09:29.944 --> 02:09:37.567]  I just statistically didn't want to try to go with a midwife at home even though they're great and it was good that my instincts said do that because my son was over 10 pounds.
[02:09:37.567 --> 02:09:46.031]  My wife with a natural childbirth after a day and a half of labor his heart rate started going down and we went ahead and she had a cesarean so she's had those ever since.
[02:09:46.031 --> 02:09:47.291]  Once you have one you got to have more and
[02:09:51.670 --> 02:09:57.153]  But I learned right off the bat, though, that the nurses would sit there with the terminal hooked up to the wall.
[02:09:57.153 --> 02:09:58.933]  This is one of the nicer hospitals.
[02:09:58.933 --> 02:09:59.934]  It's really bad at the city ones.
[02:09:59.934 --> 02:10:01.294]  This is a private one.
[02:10:01.294 --> 02:10:02.855]  Hooked up to the wall.
[02:10:02.855 --> 02:10:04.736]  And I noticed it was a health department code.
[02:10:04.736 --> 02:10:11.799]  And I already knew they were doing some of this, but I had no idea six years ago when I first learned about this.
[02:10:11.799 --> 02:10:16.742]  I learned then at the spot that they sit there and say, do you have enough food?
[02:10:16.742 --> 02:10:17.462]  Do you have enough money?
[02:10:18.081 --> 02:10:22.482]  If you say, no, I'd like some more money, it's like, your parents gotta help you out with money.
[02:10:22.482 --> 02:10:24.463]  You know, women feel secure, they feel safe.
[02:10:24.463 --> 02:10:26.384]  Oh, this is my nurse, she's helping me.
[02:10:26.384 --> 02:10:30.605]  No, you say you don't have enough money, CPS is coming, your kids are probably gone.
[02:10:30.605 --> 02:10:34.126]  Uh, they ask, hey, you fight with your husband, you have a good, stable relationship.
[02:10:34.126 --> 02:10:36.247]  Tell me the truth, honey.
[02:10:36.247 --> 02:10:37.467]  Do you feel safe with him?
[02:10:37.467 --> 02:10:38.487]  Well, no, he's never hit me.
[02:10:38.487 --> 02:10:40.308]  Well, I mean, do you guys fight?
[02:10:40.308 --> 02:10:40.948]  Well, yeah.
[02:10:40.948 --> 02:10:43.309]  Oh, your kids are gone.
[02:10:43.309 --> 02:10:44.369]  Kids are gone!
[02:10:44.369 --> 02:10:46.190]  And see, no one's telling you this.
[02:10:47.049 --> 02:10:52.115]  No one's telling you that, quote, the school counselor in elementary and middle school is asking if you spank your children.
[02:10:52.115 --> 02:10:54.358]  It's not illegal to, but they still take your kids.
[02:10:54.358 --> 02:10:56.440]  It's like there's no law to take vaccines, but they'll take them.
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:59.884]  If you don't, you know, give them a lot of times if you're ignorant.
[02:10:59.884 --> 02:11:03.769]  And I learned, and then they'd always, you know, I learned the first time what it was, because I asked my wife later.
[02:11:03.769 --> 02:11:07.013]  She said, oh, you run this file down to the floor beneath me.
[02:11:10.183 --> 02:11:11.624]  And my instinct said, hmm.
[02:11:11.624 --> 02:11:13.985]  So I left and I came back and I said, what was the head nurse asking?
[02:11:13.985 --> 02:11:17.867]  Well, she asked if we have a good home environment and then she kept pressing.
[02:11:17.867 --> 02:11:23.029]  And I remember her kind of predatorily looking at me, the power trip of the evil, the setup, the betrayal, the wickedness.
[02:11:23.029 --> 02:11:27.371]  You know, they don't tell you, judge, jury, you have a right to, you know, counsel.
[02:11:27.371 --> 02:11:31.313]  They don't tell you this is a law enforcement operation through the eugenics family court.
[02:11:33.806 --> 02:11:36.888]  And the second time, they said, oh please, different nurse, take the file down.
[02:11:36.888 --> 02:11:52.558]  And the third time, then I found out it's all over the nation, hooked into the health departments that are federalized, and then they take the blood for 35 years worldwide in the West, ship it to international DNA databases, they now admit that a decade after I told you, it's all public.
[02:11:52.558 --> 02:11:55.940]  I mean, this is just a criminal operation, all designed.
[02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:58.142]  So I wanted to go to a nurse in a hospital,
[02:11:59.128 --> 02:12:04.050]  Where she was saying that now when you come in, they just come in and just say, oh, it's part of your course in being in the hospital.
[02:12:04.050 --> 02:12:05.650]  We give you all these vaccines.
[02:12:05.650 --> 02:12:09.791]  Oh, it's part of the, you know, it's all being inculcated like it's the law.
[02:12:09.791 --> 02:12:15.073]  And I wanted, uh, Ramey in Arkansas, the nurse, to be able to have some comments on this.
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:18.762]  Yeah, Alex, so call me city, but that's okay.
[02:12:18.762 --> 02:12:20.424]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:12:20.424 --> 02:12:21.225]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:12:21.225 --> 02:12:21.945]  That's okay.
[02:12:21.945 --> 02:12:24.448]  But yeah, they just put it on the med list.
[02:12:24.448 --> 02:12:31.054]  People half the time don't know, you know, that it's a vaccine, if it's for what, or you know, same way with the meds.
[02:12:31.054 --> 02:12:34.757]  Most of the people don't know what meds they're getting, don't know why.
[02:12:34.757 --> 02:12:36.839]  It's just, it's a sad situation.
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:44.724]  And I've been doing nursing for my whole adult life, and I'm starting to get really sad about it.
[02:12:44.724 --> 02:12:46.485]  And maybe look for something else to do.
[02:12:46.485 --> 02:12:53.429]  Well, every profession's being taken over by the New World Order, the spy grid, the pharmacists, the doctors, the dentists, everything.
[02:12:53.429 --> 02:12:56.471]  Now, do you work in and around the birthing wing?
[02:12:56.471 --> 02:12:57.432]  No, I don't.
[02:12:57.432 --> 02:13:01.254]  Okay, but are you aware of the health department computers?
[02:13:01.254 --> 02:13:02.114]  Yes.
[02:13:02.114 --> 02:13:04.035]  You know, the computers hooked into the health department.
[02:13:04.035 --> 02:13:04.956]  Tell me about those.
[02:13:07.290 --> 02:13:11.952]  Well, I do know that, you know, like I said, we have to check, do we suspect abuse?
[02:13:11.952 --> 02:13:13.232]  Yes or no?
[02:13:13.232 --> 02:13:14.193]  What kind?
[02:13:14.193 --> 02:13:19.715]  And then there's a bunch of options they can choose from you have to put down.
[02:13:19.715 --> 02:13:28.079]  If you interviewed the patient alone or with their spouse or family member, whoever it might be, you know, just so they can put that in perspective a little bit.
[02:13:30.303 --> 02:13:36.787]  Yeah, so that even if the woman says no, they can still come CPS if she said no, because the man was there.
[02:13:36.787 --> 02:13:38.508]  Yes.
[02:13:38.508 --> 02:13:39.469]  Yes.
[02:13:39.469 --> 02:13:48.595]  And I do know, you know, if you come into ER, and the doctor, whoever sees you, suspects anything, it's a law they have to call DHS.
[02:13:48.595 --> 02:13:54.800]  Now folks, it's totally predatory, and women think they're getting, quote, free health care when they go to city places, they're poor.
[02:13:55.749 --> 02:13:58.571]  You better sell your cars, have your grandparents give you money.
[02:13:58.571 --> 02:14:02.353]  You do not want to take government money, especially if you've got white children.
[02:14:02.353 --> 02:14:10.337]  They get $400,000 on the open market, adopting them out, and you are literally headed into basically a pack of bank robbers.
[02:14:10.337 --> 02:14:15.940]  If you've got a blonde-haired, blue-eyed child, it is just hell for us.
[02:14:15.940 --> 02:14:17.061]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:17.741 --> 02:14:25.963]  I was just going to say, I'm sure I'm in some database, because when I had my son, I told him absolutely no Hep B vaccine.
[02:14:25.963 --> 02:14:32.384]  When I first went in, I was against him getting the vitamin K shot, because there had been problems with that.
[02:14:32.384 --> 02:14:36.825]  I understand there can be some problems when they do some of those newborn screenings.
[02:14:36.825 --> 02:14:38.545]  Yeah, it's killed a bunch of babies.
[02:14:38.545 --> 02:14:42.746]  The vitamin K almost killed, who's the famous actor from The Right Stuff?
[02:14:44.839 --> 02:14:47.980]  Oh, the one that had the Heparin twins?
[02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:49.681]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:49.681 --> 02:14:52.022]  Dennis Quaid, yeah.
[02:14:52.022 --> 02:14:57.264]  So, I'm sure, you know, automatically when I told the nurse that, they had the caseworker in there.
[02:14:57.264 --> 02:15:05.987]  Oh yeah, they bring in the black op devil, the caseworker, because you dare question their lordliness.
[02:15:05.987 --> 02:15:11.149]  No law, just a pack of devils pushing their crap on you and their eugenics on you.
[02:15:11.149 --> 02:15:12.450]  Well, anything else you want to add?
[02:15:13.488 --> 02:15:21.273]  Um, just everybody take as few meds as you can and make sure you research them and you know the side effects of that med.
[02:15:21.273 --> 02:15:24.355]  And just be really careful and watch the recalls.
[02:15:24.355 --> 02:15:25.436]  I hear you and God bless you.
[02:15:25.436 --> 02:15:27.277]  Call us back with other developments.
[02:15:27.277 --> 02:15:31.060]  I just want you to know, but don't act paranoid either or they'll come after your kids.
[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:32.821]  Just, you gotta act smiley.
[02:15:32.821 --> 02:15:36.703]  God, but you understand, you are in a law enforcement interrogation room.
[02:15:36.703 --> 02:15:40.286]  Public schools, the churches now are spies, most of the big ones.
[02:15:41.267 --> 02:15:47.078]  Uh, your workplaces, medical facilities, it's just everywhere.
[02:15:47.078 --> 02:15:49.342]  The evil is taking over.
[02:15:50.317 --> 02:15:53.598]  One-tenth of the college grads are now part of Black Ops.
[02:15:53.598 --> 02:15:58.180]  Homeland security everywhere, total control, secret camps everywhere.
[02:15:58.180 --> 02:16:03.882]  And joining us is the man who runs theresistancemanifesto.com, markdice.com.
[02:16:03.882 --> 02:16:07.104]  Mark Dice, for the rest of the hour, thank you so much, Mark Dice.
[02:16:07.104 --> 02:16:08.484]  You've got a new edition.
[02:16:08.484 --> 02:16:10.065]  You sold out of the last one.
[02:16:10.065 --> 02:16:14.326]  A new edition of your excellent book, The Resistance Manifesto.
[02:16:14.326 --> 02:16:15.607]  This one has a gray cover.
[02:16:16.227 --> 02:16:25.021]  I have one here in my hot little hands, and it is just a great read, powerful and compelling, as I said about the first one.
[02:16:25.021 --> 02:16:25.943]  Welcome to the Airwaves!
[02:16:27.308 --> 02:16:34.255]  Thank you, and I think what I want to do is help everybody understand what's going on today by taking a look back at history.
[02:16:34.255 --> 02:16:42.323]  I think in order to understand a situation or even a mechanism today, we look at how it was created, the systems that are behind it.
[02:16:42.323 --> 02:16:46.748]  So, later on I want to quote some writings from Adam Weisshop himself.
[02:16:47.888 --> 02:16:51.670]  I'm not just going to be saying what the New World Order is doing, what the Illuminati is doing.
[02:16:51.670 --> 02:16:59.355]  I'm just going to be reading quotes from the founder of the Illuminati, or the credited founder, Adam Weissopp, from other Illuminati writers.
[02:16:59.355 --> 02:17:04.938]  Alice Bailey, Helena Blavatsky, who wrote The Secret Doctrine, which was Adolf Hitler's favorite book.
[02:17:05.758 --> 02:17:21.103]  And even some interesting quotes from the founder of the Church of Satan, from Anton LaVey, which will just prove to show that he is an evil, sinister man that really lies about his true intentions and even his philosophical and religious beliefs.
[02:17:21.103 --> 02:17:22.903]  It's all about deception.
[02:17:22.903 --> 02:17:26.104]  And the ultimate power to hurt the innocent and the weak.
[02:17:26.104 --> 02:17:28.065]  It's their pleasure, their relish.
[02:17:28.065 --> 02:17:30.646]  Before we do that, Mark, you're a big part of Truth Rising.
[02:17:30.646 --> 02:17:32.986]  It's such an important film.
[02:17:32.986 --> 02:17:34.607]  I want to get your take on Truth Rising.
[02:17:35.479 --> 02:17:37.241]  Oh, just absolutely amazing.
[02:17:37.241 --> 02:17:47.408]  I mean, I must have watched the film probably four or five times, and it's unlike anything that you've ever done or that anybody's ever done, and I think it's going to do two things.
[02:17:47.408 --> 02:17:54.174]  Not only does it educate, but it motivates as well, and I know that there's going to be a lot of people out there now that can see how easy
[02:17:54.754 --> 02:17:58.755]  That how compelling, how energizing it is to get in these people's faces.
[02:17:58.755 --> 02:18:02.276]  Now that everybody has a YouTube channel, they could post this video.
[02:18:02.276 --> 02:18:08.217]  You know, two or three years ago, before YouTube or before Google Video, it would be very difficult to get this information out to the masses.
[02:18:08.217 --> 02:18:19.180]  But now, we can throw it up on YouTube, you can go to these people's book signings, their campaign stops, their dinners, whatever they do that has access given to the public.
[02:18:19.687 --> 02:18:20.028]  I think so.
[02:18:35.942 --> 02:18:59.888]  We've had a tremendous effect on them and I mean my god I just I can't give enough praises to not only Truth Rising the film and everybody who put it together but everybody that was that was in it for everybody that was risking their you know risking their behind getting out there and getting in everybody's faces and I mean it's some of the best footage that that I've ever seen things you won't even find on the the Fox News you know greatest
[02:19:00.388 --> 02:19:03.450]  Sports tragedies are the most compelling video.
[02:19:03.450 --> 02:19:05.391]  You know, I mean, it's exciting to watch.
[02:19:05.391 --> 02:19:08.853]  And I also want to urge everybody to not just email people, Google links.
[02:19:09.542 --> 02:19:12.105]  You know, to get the DVD, give it out to people.
[02:19:12.105 --> 02:19:19.692]  It's one thing to get an email from somebody and say, hey, look at this video, and they have to sit there on the computer, but it's another thing if you actually give them a DVD or a book.
[02:19:19.692 --> 02:19:20.373]  No, your book.
[02:19:20.373 --> 02:19:22.395]  I love your new book.
[02:19:22.395 --> 02:19:26.759]  You're a big part of the film, and so is we are changing 9-11 Truth, and we just want to thank you, Mark.
[02:19:26.759 --> 02:19:32.265]  When we come back, I'm going to let you basically have the floor here and go over the Resistance Manifesto, the new
[02:19:33.205 --> 02:19:33.746]  We're good to go.
[02:20:02.188 --> 02:20:06.252]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:20:06.252 --> 02:20:12.138]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:20:12.138 --> 02:20:17.963]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:20:17.963 --> 02:20:21.827]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984,
[02:20:23.729 --> 02:20:31.756]  And the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings, are subject to government intervention.
[02:20:31.756 --> 02:20:37.361]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:20:37.361 --> 02:20:43.186]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:20:44.006 --> 02:20:46.848]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:46.848 --> 02:20:50.470]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:20:50.470 --> 02:20:53.432]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:53.432 --> 02:20:57.714]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:20:57.714 --> 02:20:58.675]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:58.675 --> 02:21:08.481]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:08.481 --> 02:21:10.162]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:11.118 --> 02:21:12.660]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:12.660 --> 02:21:13.461]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:13.461 --> 02:21:14.522]  This is his M.O.
[02:21:14.522 --> 02:21:15.824]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:15.824 --> 02:21:17.826]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:17.826 --> 02:21:24.974]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:24.974 --> 02:21:25.455]  Some U.S.
[02:21:25.455 --> 02:21:31.102]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:31.802 --> 02:21:35.685]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:35.685 --> 02:21:45.771]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:21:45.771 --> 02:21:47.012]  Fabled enemies.

[02:21:54.777 --> 02:21:58.140]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:22:01.940 --> 02:22:02.761]  Question.
[02:22:02.761 --> 02:22:07.503]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[02:22:07.503 --> 02:22:11.986]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[02:22:11.986 --> 02:22:12.827]  Question.
[02:22:12.827 --> 02:22:18.110]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:18.871]  Question.
[02:22:18.871 --> 02:22:22.453]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[02:23:01.528 --> 02:23:04.890]  Alabama state code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[02:23:04.890 --> 02:23:08.612]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[02:23:08.612 --> 02:23:12.694]  In Minnesota, you can be fined for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[02:23:12.694 --> 02:23:17.376]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[02:23:17.376 --> 02:23:20.197]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[02:23:20.197 --> 02:23:25.340]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional, and cost you valuable time and money.
[02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:32.462]  SprayYourPlate.com is a spray-on photo blocker that protects against red light cameras, toll cameras, and speed cameras.

[02:24:02.161 --> 02:24:11.009]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:14.733]  The Resistance Manifesto.

[02:24:27.169 --> 02:24:28.190]  Powerful and compelling.
[02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.771]  A must-read.
[02:24:29.921 --> 02:24:41.473]  This is a manifesto by Mark Dyson, 450 pages of extensively researched and documented information, drawing from classified, declassified documents, mainstream news articles, religious texts, and personal interviews.
[02:24:41.473 --> 02:24:48.139]  A dark web of evil is exposed like never before, making Bible prophecy and the New World Order crystal clear.
[02:24:48.139 --> 02:24:50.702]  Learn the most powerful information about the Illuminati.
[02:24:51.474 --> 02:24:56.876]  Plans for the rise of the Antichrist, the institutions, people and powers involved, and how you can fight them.

[02:25:13.202 --> 02:25:14.323]  Okay, break the book down, buddy.
[02:25:14.323 --> 02:25:14.883]  You got the floor.
[02:25:16.181 --> 02:25:23.904]  Now, I want to just start off by reading a quote from Adam Weisshaupt, founder of the Illuminati, and this was discovered back in the late 1700s.
[02:25:23.904 --> 02:25:34.128]  Some people think that the Illuminati is some fictional creation, that it doesn't even exist, but in history books and encyclopedias, it admits that it was a real organization.
[02:25:34.128 --> 02:25:34.848]  It's disputed.
[02:25:35.288 --> 02:25:50.023]  By some quote-unquote scholars as to whether it really continues to exist, but this was their plans written over 230 years ago that were discovered in 1786 and then published for everybody to read for their own eyes.
[02:25:50.023 --> 02:25:53.126]  And just, let's just read this and see if it rings true today.
[02:25:53.126 --> 02:25:55.869]  This was 230 years ago that Adam Wysop wrote this.
[02:25:56.522 --> 02:25:59.103]  By this plan, we shall direct all of mankind.
[02:25:59.103 --> 02:26:03.906]  In this manner, and by the simplest means, we shall set all in motion and in flames.
[02:26:03.906 --> 02:26:10.229]  The occupants must be so allotted and contrived that we, in secret, influence all political transactions.
[02:26:10.229 --> 02:26:19.214]  I've considered everything and so prepared it, and if the order shall this day go into ruin, I shall, in a year, reestablish it more brilliant than ever.
[02:26:20.578 --> 02:26:27.839]  There must be not a single purpose, whichever comes into sight, that is ambiguous and that betrays our aims against religion and the state.
[02:26:27.839 --> 02:26:36.861]  One must speak sometimes in one way and sometimes another, but never to contradict ourselves, and so that with respect to our true way of thinking, we may be impenetrable.
[02:26:36.861 --> 02:26:47.243]  This can be done in no other way than by secret associations by which the degrees, and in silence, possess themselves of the government and the states, and make of those means for this purpose.
[02:26:48.203 --> 02:26:54.708]  The Order will, for its own sake, and therefore certainly place every man in a situation for which he will be most effective.
[02:26:54.708 --> 02:27:03.455]  The pupils are convinced that the Order will rule the world, and every member, therefore, becomes a ruler.
[02:27:03.455 --> 02:27:06.617]  Now that's Adam Weisshaupt himself, 230 years ago.
[02:27:06.617 --> 02:27:12.522]  And this is before television, before mass media, before anything, and they understood the power
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:17.183]  ...of shaping public opinions and I'm just going to go on here.
[02:27:17.183 --> 02:27:26.912]  By establishing reading societies and subscription libraries and taking these under our direction and supplying them through our labors, we may turn the public mind which way we will.
[02:27:26.912 --> 02:27:29.955]  In like manner, we must obtain influence in the military academies.
[02:27:29.955 --> 02:27:32.097]  This might be of certain consequence.
[02:27:32.097 --> 02:27:38.102]  The printing houses, bookseller shops, chapters, in short, all offices which have any effect either in forming
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:42.241]  or managing and in directing the mind of man.
[02:27:42.241 --> 02:27:45.662]  Painting and engraving are highly worth our care.
[02:27:45.662 --> 02:27:47.463]  We get all the literary journals.
[02:27:47.463 --> 02:27:55.226]  We take care by well-timed pieces to make citizens and princes a little more noticed for their certain little slips.
[02:27:56.072 --> 02:28:03.822]  So they knew 230 years ago the power of controlling the media, and they wrote, plain and simple, their plans down for everybody to see.
[02:28:03.822 --> 02:28:13.554]  All these quotes are fully admitted legitimate by historians, and they're found in several books, several hundred years old, and I reprint them in the Resistance Manifesto.
[02:28:14.338 --> 02:28:24.285]  And so anybody that just doubts that even such an organization exists, or that there are plans to control the media, to control political institutions, just needs to look at their own writings.
[02:28:24.285 --> 02:28:28.909]  So this isn't just me saying this, this isn't just Alex Jones saying this is what they're doing.
[02:28:28.909 --> 02:28:34.453]  If you look at their own documents, their own publicly released writings, you can just see for yourselves
[02:28:34.953 --> 02:28:35.414]  Yeah, now that's...
[02:28:51.656 --> 02:29:17.954]  That's some writings from Adam Weisshaupt and from Xavier Bonswack, one of the other fellow members of the original Bavarian Illuminati, and they go on to say that they're planning to destroy Christianity, to replace all governments, to use feminism to break down society, and, you know, for some people that think that the Illuminati was just a free-thinking organization of men that were fighting the oppression of the church,
[02:29:18.482 --> 02:29:22.145]  Really just needs to understand and investigate what a dirtbag Adam Weisshaupt was.
[02:29:22.145 --> 02:29:23.986]  He impregnated his sister-in-law.
[02:29:23.986 --> 02:29:30.211]  He tried to kill her to make sure that the child wouldn't be born so that nobody would know.
[02:29:30.211 --> 02:29:40.139]  They discovered black-op tools 230 years ago in their possessions where they had powder that they would blow in people's face that would blind them or kill them.
[02:29:40.139 --> 02:29:45.924]  They had gases that they would inject into people's houses to kill them.
[02:29:45.924 --> 02:29:47.125]  They had counterfeiting tools
[02:29:47.465 --> 02:29:48.406]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:29:48.406 --> 02:29:52.169]  Let's talk more about our enemy when we get back.
[02:29:52.169 --> 02:29:56.112]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.112 --> 02:30:02.277]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.277 --> 02:30:09.242]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero and we knew what to do.
[02:30:09.974 --> 02:30:10.915]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:30:10.915 --> 02:30:12.457]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th, made a statement.
[02:30:24.465 --> 02:30:27.268]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[02:30:27.268 --> 02:30:29.691]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:30:29.691 --> 02:30:32.174]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[02:30:43.266 --> 02:30:46.348]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[02:30:55.312 --> 02:31:01.716]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:31:01.716 --> 02:31:02.496]  Hi there.
[02:31:02.496 --> 02:31:04.177]  I want to talk to you about a dirty word.
[02:31:05.735 --> 02:31:06.856]  I know, I know.
[02:31:06.856 --> 02:31:10.398]  As the makers of drink and mate hangover defense tablets, we hear it every day.
[02:31:10.398 --> 02:31:13.660]  Grown, respectable adults don't get hangovers.
[02:31:13.660 --> 02:31:21.564]  Hangovers are what you got in college when you had about ten too many at the frat house and then rolled out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon the next day.
[02:31:21.564 --> 02:31:22.464]  These days?
[02:31:22.464 --> 02:31:28.888]  Well, sure, sometimes you'll have a couple drinks with dinner and sometimes you'll wake up with a little headache feeling just a bit queasy.
[02:31:28.888 --> 02:31:31.209]  But that's not really a hangover, is it?
[02:31:31.209 --> 02:31:32.610]  Well, call it what you want, but now
[02:31:34.505 --> 02:31:35.025]  Thanks for watching!

[02:32:01.616 --> 02:32:07.758]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals and businesses.
[02:32:07.758 --> 02:32:09.698]  But there is something you can do.

[02:32:51.352 --> 02:32:52.053]  I was a highway man.
[02:33:09.210 --> 02:33:18.821]  Along the coach roads I did ride, with sword and pistol by my side.
[02:33:18.821 --> 02:33:22.405]  Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade.
[02:33:22.405 --> 02:33:24.947]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[02:33:34.135 --> 02:33:37.676]  How cool is it that he's with us?
[02:33:37.676 --> 02:33:55.585]  And how great is it that we get to have a fellowship of good men and women of every race, color, and creed who love freedom and hate tyranny?
[02:33:55.585 --> 02:33:58.446]  We resist the Crowleyan edict of do as thou wilt
[02:33:59.841 --> 02:34:01.642]  The people are there to be fed on abuse.
[02:34:01.642 --> 02:34:06.906]  We resist the tyranny of the tyrants.
[02:34:06.906 --> 02:34:16.812]  And I'm just so honored to have a great man like Mark Dice, champion of freedom.
[02:34:16.812 --> 02:34:22.655]  As a friend, and as a colleague, and that he's here with us today.
[02:34:22.655 --> 02:34:23.856]  The Resistance Manifesto.
[02:34:23.856 --> 02:34:25.497]  Alright, continue.
[02:34:27.364 --> 02:34:37.959]  So, covering some more of Adam Wysop's evil deeds, they had found black-op tools, a collection of hundreds of seals, because back then people would have wax.
[02:34:38.692 --> 02:34:39.352]  We're good to go.
[02:35:02.123 --> 02:35:11.426]  And so, you know, for anybody that thinks that they were an Enlightenment group of gentlemen, it was a gentlemen's club, fighting the oppression of the church, doesn't fully understand that.
[02:35:11.426 --> 02:35:14.688]  And the same goes with Anton LaVey, the founder of the Church of Satan.
[02:35:14.688 --> 02:35:21.690]  A lot of people think that he's just an atheistic Satanist, and it's just a different world philosophy.
[02:35:21.690 --> 02:35:26.472]  But let's see what Anton LaVey himself has to say about his hopes for
[02:35:27.052 --> 02:35:32.141]  Uh, the Satanic Bible, and then what's found in his authorized biography written by his second wife.
[02:35:32.141 --> 02:35:35.266]  So, you know, somebody, anybody can write a biography about somebody.
[02:35:35.266 --> 02:35:41.176]  This is the authorized biography, so that means his ex-wife or his, uh, really his widow.
[02:35:42.162 --> 02:35:43.103]  Approved.
[02:35:43.103 --> 02:35:46.966]  This book is a state approved it and she wrote this book.
[02:35:46.966 --> 02:36:02.020]  So it goes on here on page 216 of his authorized biography to say that investigators, no matter how objective they may be, may become disturbed by the increasing number of satanic Bibles found at crime scenes and in the personal effects of mass murderers.
[02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:08.406]  It may be that LaVey's satanic thought can release forces within unstable people that they are not able to control.
[02:36:09.295 --> 02:36:14.760]  Anton maintains that he isn't really concerned about accusations of people killing people in the name of Satan.
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:19.824]  He swears that each time he reads of a new killing spree, his only reaction is, what, 22 people?
[02:36:19.824 --> 02:36:21.866]  Is that all?
[02:36:21.866 --> 02:36:31.674]  He goes on to say, there will undoubtedly be more satanic motivated murders and crimes in the sense that the satanic Bible tells you, you don't have to take any more expletives.
[02:36:33.028 --> 02:36:45.251]  And then he goes on to say here that the only way that I would like to help, this is LeVay here, the only way that he would like to help the great majority of people is in the same way that Carl Pendram, a serial killer, quote, reforms people who try to reform him.
[02:36:45.251 --> 02:36:51.512]  It would be most mercifully to help them by relieving them of the stress and the life that they seem to hate so much.
[02:36:51.512 --> 02:36:58.534]  People should be happy that I'm not a humanitarian or I would be the most diabolical mass murderer the world has ever known.
[02:36:58.534 --> 02:37:02.015]  That's coming from Anton LeVay from his own mouth that he
[02:37:02.785 --> 02:37:04.245]  He wants people to use his book.
[02:37:04.245 --> 02:37:09.747]  He hopes that satanic philosophies will encourage people to destroy one another.
[02:37:09.747 --> 02:37:30.793]  And in an interview in Newsweek back in 1971, shortly after the Church of Satan was founded, and his book, The Satanic Bible, was published, he admitted that one of his goals, this is in a Newsweek article, that one of his goals was the creation of a police state in which weak people were weeded out and the, quote, achievement-oriented leadership were permitted to pursue the mysteries of black magic.
[02:37:31.545 --> 02:37:37.400]  And some people say that Anton LaVey and that, quote, Satanists don't really worship Satan, that they're atheists.
[02:37:38.187 --> 02:37:49.596]  But it's interesting that Anton LeVay, in his own authorized biography, talks about using prayer to try to help with a child of, I believe it was one of his girlfriends, Jane Mansfield.
[02:37:49.596 --> 02:38:01.666]  She had a little boy that was injured in an accident, and so he got his fellow Satan worshippers together, and they prayed to Satan, asking for Satan to help the little boy get well and recover.
[02:38:02.107 --> 02:38:09.524]  Which is very strange considering that the founder, the current high priest of the Church of Satan, Peter Gilmore, who I interviewed...
[02:38:11.163 --> 02:38:34.582]  Satanists don't believe in religious nonsense, yet here we have Anton LaVey in his own authorized biography admitting that they have prayed to Satan to try to bestow blessings and help somebody, but they insult people who want to pray and believe in God and ask for Jesus' blessings, but apparently he thinks it's okay and not hypocritical to ask for Satan's help.
[02:38:34.582 --> 02:38:39.066]  And Peter Gilmore, the current high priest of the Church of Satan, describes the satanic
[02:38:40.047 --> 02:38:51.183]  Church as, quote, the organization is a cabal, a shadowy underground network of like-minded individuals who work to lever against the inertia of the world towards ends favorable to Satanism.
[02:38:52.415 --> 02:39:02.158]  LeVay used Orwell's 1984 model for a cell system in which each member didn't have awareness of exactly who else might be involved.
[02:39:02.158 --> 02:39:13.722]  And then if we get into some teachings from Olyster Crowley, again, who some satanic apologists think that he was just another Enlightenment author and a fellow truth seeker.
[02:39:14.843 --> 02:39:33.337]  If you actually read his books, not only the one in In Theory, Magic, and Theory in Practice where he describes instructions on how to give human sacrifices and says that the best spiritual victim is an innocent male child by sacrificing this child because it has an innocent, pure soul that you somehow gather its energy.
[02:39:33.337 --> 02:39:40.823]  He says that openly in one of his books, in one of his most famous books, the Book of the Law, he goes on to say that
[02:39:42.017 --> 02:39:46.078]  He is the God that this God that was dictating this book to him, apparently.
[02:39:46.078 --> 02:39:49.779]  He says, uh, compassion is the vice of kings.
[02:39:49.779 --> 02:39:51.660]  Stamp down the wretched and the weak.
[02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:53.280]  This is the law of the strong.
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:55.521]  This is our law and the joy of the world.
[02:39:55.521 --> 02:39:56.621]  Now let it be understood.
[02:39:56.621 --> 02:40:02.823]  If the body of the king dissolved, he shall remain in ecstasy forever, he says.
[02:40:02.823 --> 02:40:03.043]  Note,
[02:40:03.797 --> 02:40:08.326]  Let it be now known and first understood that I am the God of war and vengeance.
[02:40:08.326 --> 02:40:09.769]  Worship me with blood and fire.
[02:40:09.769 --> 02:40:11.953]  Worship me with swords and spears.
[02:40:11.953 --> 02:40:13.857]  This is my command.
[02:40:13.857 --> 02:40:15.340]  He goes on to say, I will give
[02:40:16.201 --> 02:40:17.782]  I will give of their flesh to eat.
[02:40:17.782 --> 02:40:21.723]  Sacrifice cattle, little and big, after a child.
[02:40:21.723 --> 02:40:23.004]  Kill and torture.
[02:40:23.004 --> 02:40:25.285]  I'm reading directly from the book here.
[02:40:25.285 --> 02:40:26.045]  Kill and torture.
[02:40:26.045 --> 02:40:26.646]  Spare not.
[02:40:26.646 --> 02:40:27.786]  Be upon them.
[02:40:27.786 --> 02:40:29.327]  The best blood is out of the moon.
[02:40:29.327 --> 02:40:31.648]  Shortly then, the flesh of a child.
[02:40:31.648 --> 02:40:33.589]  Or the dropping of the host of heaven.
[02:40:33.589 --> 02:40:34.669]  Then of enemies.
[02:40:34.669 --> 02:40:35.930]  Then of a priest.
[02:40:35.930 --> 02:40:37.570]  Or the worshippers.
[02:40:37.570 --> 02:40:42.092]  And then he goes on to say that he wants to peck the eyes out of Jesus.
[02:40:42.092 --> 02:40:43.213]  He cursed them.
[02:40:43.911 --> 02:40:47.695]  With my hawk's head, I peck the eyes out of Jesus as he hangs from the cross.
[02:40:47.695 --> 02:40:52.500]  So this isn't just me saying that these are a bunch of evil, despicable people.
[02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:55.924]  If you just read their own words in their own books that are published, they just admit it.
[02:40:57.955 --> 02:41:00.856]  Well, they also talk about how they con their own members.
[02:41:00.856 --> 02:41:12.938]  They talk about how we tell the idiots that it's really white and black magic are the same, and then these morons come in and we tell them we don't really believe in all this evil, so we can then feed on them.
[02:41:12.938 --> 02:41:14.018]  Look at how dumb they are.
[02:41:14.018 --> 02:41:21.540]  It's all about the more deceptive you can be, the more innocence you can hurt, and it is a satanic world system running things, and they believe they get more power
[02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:42.460]  And that's why Dinecore and Halliburton run giant child kidnapping rings, and they'll make a big deal in the news about some degenerate rock star and, you know, Vietnam raping ten-year-old girls, which is horrible, but then grandstand how they're good all day, and then they build up a giant anti-kidnapping global system, which is really designed through Interpol so they can kidnap who they want.
[02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:47.663]  You're right, and I've heard you say this many times, and I know that there are some atheist listeners out there, but
[02:41:48.354 --> 02:42:02.203]  This core people, this core group of the so-called enlightened ones, this Illuminati, they believe in a spiritual world, they believe in spiritual laws, they believe in a god or two gods or a force that manifests itself in two different forms.
[02:42:02.203 --> 02:42:08.487]  And so they are trying to keep everybody away from this power, away from the spiritual laws, so that they can use it themselves.
[02:42:08.487 --> 02:42:11.629]  And Albert Pike admits this in Morals and Dogma, Morals and Dogma.
[02:42:11.629 --> 02:42:13.050]  Some people might have heard these quotes.
[02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:18.671]  You know, on the internet, you hear people talking about these things, but when I was investigating this, I thought it was so ridiculous.
[02:42:18.671 --> 02:42:22.092]  I never believed that somebody would write such a thing, so I went out and I bought all the books.
[02:42:22.092 --> 02:42:30.435]  So, these quotes that I'm reading to you aren't just off of some website that I pulled that have been, you know, copied and pasted over dozens and dozens of pages.
[02:42:30.435 --> 02:42:34.456]  These quotes, I am pulling directly out of the books I own.
[02:42:34.456 --> 02:42:42.638]  These books I own, Morals and Dogma, where Albert Pike says that masonry, like all religions and mysteries, conceals, reading right from the book.
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:49.723]  And he goes on to say how much he loves Lucifer.
[02:42:49.723 --> 02:42:52.945]  I want you to get into that in a moment.
[02:42:52.945 --> 02:42:54.727]  Meanwhile, Mason's going to their halls.
[02:42:54.727 --> 02:42:56.588]  All of them have Albert Pike hanging in it.
[02:42:56.588 --> 02:42:59.670]  And if you tell them you're really worshipping Lucifer, it'll be fighting words.
[02:42:59.670 --> 02:43:04.854]  They've never read the writings of the books that he himself published.
[02:43:04.854 --> 02:43:09.237]  So this is also part of the bigger joke that their own members don't know what they're part of.
[02:43:10.123 --> 02:43:10.503]  Yeah, of course.
[02:43:10.503 --> 02:43:17.070]  I'm one of the lower-level members, and when I first started investigating this, I couldn't believe that such a huge organization would be full of state worshippers.
[02:43:17.070 --> 02:43:23.818]  But then you find out that the three lower levels, you know, somebody gets to a master mason, you think, oh, that's some high-level mason.
[02:43:23.818 --> 02:43:24.799]  That's just the third level.
[02:43:24.799 --> 02:43:26.320]  They're not even in the lodge.
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:27.201]  That's the third step.
[02:43:27.201 --> 02:43:28.623]  They're still considered porch masons.
[02:43:28.623 --> 02:43:31.265]  They haven't even been told about the higher levels of mystery.
[02:43:31.906 --> 02:43:43.071]  Nobody's going to find this quote-unquote, you know, royal secret or the secret doctrine until they get up to the high levels and then they're going to be chosen to be awarded with this knowledge.
[02:43:43.071 --> 02:43:57.738]  And in his own book he says that not only do they conceal the truth from their own members, this is in his own words, he says that they use quote, false explanations and misinterpretations of the symbols to mislead those who deserve to be misled and to conceal the truth, which he called light.
[02:43:58.348 --> 02:44:00.989]  from them to draw them further away from it.
[02:44:00.989 --> 02:44:06.491]  And then later on he goes on to say, yeah, Lucifer, the light bearer, strange and mysterious name to give to the spirit of darkness.
[02:44:06.491 --> 02:44:10.092]  Lucifer, the sun of the morning, is it he who bears the light?
[02:44:10.092 --> 02:44:10.912]  Doubt it not.
[02:44:10.912 --> 02:44:12.293]  Doubt it not with an exclamation point.
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:16.782]  You could just draw your own conclusions as to whether they're Luciferian and look at their school.
[02:44:16.782 --> 02:44:21.104]  Now again, we're talking Manly P. Hall, Albert Pike, the former heads of Global Masonry.
[02:44:21.104 --> 02:44:34.551]  Tell the listeners, this is all a footnote in your book, this is a manifesto, the new edition, but for Masons who might be listening, because I had a lot of family who were Masons, they weren't bad people, they were lower level, but some that did become high level told my dad.
[02:44:34.551 --> 02:44:38.233]  One of his grandfathers, one of his great uncles said, do not join this,
[02:44:39.082 --> 02:44:41.583]  With the higher levels, it is not what you're told.
[02:44:41.583 --> 02:44:43.544]  Because Texas is a Lone Star State.
[02:44:43.544 --> 02:44:44.384]  Big into Masons.
[02:44:44.384 --> 02:44:45.925]  It's not saying George Washington's bad.
[02:44:45.925 --> 02:44:50.127]  It's not saying they didn't understand that this is how the evil controls good people.
[02:44:50.127 --> 02:44:52.828]  It's about saying, oh, it's a fraternal order of good.
[02:44:52.828 --> 02:44:54.689]  But at the top, it's bad.
[02:44:54.689 --> 02:44:58.310]  And has been bottom line taken over by these people.
[02:44:58.310 --> 02:45:00.531]  Give the Masons out there listening the footnotes again.
[02:45:01.556 --> 02:45:08.059]  Well, you can go to page 321 in Morals and Dogma, where he admits that Lucifer bears the light.
[02:45:08.059 --> 02:45:11.140]  In the book, he admits that Freemasonry is a religion.
[02:45:11.140 --> 02:45:18.344]  A lot of the Freemasons will deny, and even the head of the lodge that you see on the History Channel denies that Freemasonry is a religion.
[02:45:18.344 --> 02:45:24.346]  In Albert Pike's book, which is the Bible of Freemasonry, it contains all the rituals for all the different levels.
[02:45:24.346 --> 02:45:25.687]  When the book was originally published,
[02:45:26.387 --> 02:45:36.252]  A hundred years ago, upon the death, it said this right in the book, upon the death of a member, the book needed to be returned to the lodge, because they didn't want that getting out and having people understand that.
[02:45:36.252 --> 02:45:37.933]  And so, it is a religion.
[02:45:37.933 --> 02:45:53.921]  They go on, here it says in the 28th degree, in the nights of the sun, or the prince of death, that the true word of the mason is to be found concealed in the profound meaning of the ineffable name of deity, which the name was lost by, and various precautions were taken to conceal it.
[02:45:54.481 --> 02:45:56.963]  Okay, so they're hiding the actual truth.
[02:45:56.963 --> 02:46:04.667]  He admits it right there in the book, on page 104 and 105, that they conceal, and that the word conceal is emphasized in the original.
[02:46:04.667 --> 02:46:06.829]  I have the original book, it's emphasized.
[02:46:06.829 --> 02:46:10.111]  They conceal the secrets from all, except the adepts and the sages.
[02:46:10.111 --> 02:46:18.236]  So, just because somebody's a third-level master mason, and they go and they help the children, and they run around and do different community events, doesn't mean that they're bad.
[02:46:18.236 --> 02:46:22.038]  It's just like if you go to a fraternity party, or if you work for a business,
[02:46:22.538 --> 02:46:40.325]  If the chieftains up at the top level are doing all sorts of crimes, or if the frat boys upstairs in the bedrooms are dealing coke or raping somebody, it doesn't mean that you're bad because you're there, but you need to be aware of this, that they are lying to you, that they're doing this knowingly and willingly, that this is a power structure.
[02:46:40.325 --> 02:46:42.826]  And some of the Illuminati writings, such as Alice Bailey,
[02:46:43.978 --> 02:46:45.258]  It admits this freely.
[02:46:45.258 --> 02:46:52.960]  Now, we have some people that write about the Illuminati and these Enlightenment groups trying to expose them, but we have some people that write about them to spread their message.
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:55.121]  And these books are hidden in plain view.
[02:46:55.121 --> 02:47:11.885]  They're given to high-level members, the Skull and Bones leaders and the such, where they go on to say, here's Alice Bailey in her book, Externalization of the Hierarchy, where she freely admits the members of the hierarchy are to be seen as the custodians of the divine plan, the spiritual hierarchy of the planet, and the ability of mankind to
[02:47:12.512 --> 02:47:12.893]  We're good.
[02:47:21.195 --> 02:47:38.281]  So it goes on to say that the fact that the hierarchy consists of hundreds of thousands today, though still denied by the Orthodox, the general public is familiar with the idea of the existence of the Mysteries, and either gullibly accept the mass of futile and idiotic information handed out today by many who fight against it, and spread this teaching.
[02:47:38.281 --> 02:47:45.824]  So there they're admitting that there is this secret group, and later on it goes on to say that they have fully infiltrated the churches.
[02:47:46.502 --> 02:47:59.335]  There will be an invocated work of the masses, trained by the spiritual and minded people of the world, working within the churches, whenever possible, under an enlightened clergy, to accept the fact that the approaching spiritual energy is focused on the spiritual hierarchy.
[02:47:59.335 --> 02:48:02.599]  So, if you just look in their own books, you can understand this.
[02:48:02.599 --> 02:48:03.500]  And this is all written up.
[02:48:04.020 --> 02:48:06.801]  Hundreds of years ago, or 50, 80 years ago.
[02:48:06.801 --> 02:48:10.222]  And so it makes things today seem a little bit more in place.
[02:48:10.222 --> 02:48:13.642]  Now we can understand we have Operation Mockingbird where they're controlling the media.
[02:48:13.642 --> 02:48:17.323]  We have the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:17.323 --> 02:48:28.366]  These private organizations, now that are quasi-governmental, or that the public thinks are government organizations, when if you just look back to Adam Weisshop's writings 230 years ago, that they planned this.
[02:48:28.366 --> 02:48:29.066]  And by the way,
[02:48:30.157 --> 02:48:42.304]  We haven't even covered here today one of the chapters in this 450-something page long book, The Resistance Manifesto, available at markdice.com.
[02:48:42.304 --> 02:48:47.987]  What about people listening on AM and FM, or people that don't have a computer, or don't like to buy things on the Internet?
[02:48:47.987 --> 02:48:50.849]  How do they get your book if they don't have a computer?
[02:48:52.048 --> 02:48:54.712]  You know, it's available on markdose.com.
[02:48:54.712 --> 02:49:03.503]  You could email me, or I guess you could send in... Well, I know you've asked me to carry the book, and I've just been too busy to actually get it on our list, but it's a great book.
[02:49:03.503 --> 02:49:04.885]  I want to carry it, Mark.
[02:49:04.885 --> 02:49:08.169]  So I'll just tell listeners, I'm going to go ahead and put an order in for $200 a day.
[02:49:08.169 --> 02:49:09.131]  We need to work out a price.
[02:49:09.671 --> 02:49:19.214]  So in the next few weeks I can post it on the site, and then people that don't have a computer or don't want to order over the internet, want to order over phone or mail order, I'm going to definitely, you know, I wanted to read your new edition.
[02:49:19.214 --> 02:49:20.815]  I've finished most of it.
[02:49:20.815 --> 02:49:24.076]  It's really, a lot of it's new compared to the old book, and it's better than the last one.
[02:49:24.076 --> 02:49:25.517]  The last one was great.
[02:49:25.517 --> 02:49:28.918]  So I'm definitely going to carry it, and that's one way folks will be able to get it.
[02:49:28.918 --> 02:49:33.960]  In fact, if people just go ahead and write in to us now, they can get the book, because I'll have it in in about a week.
[02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:37.341]  But for most of you who are on the internet, MarkDice.com, and we only covered
[02:49:38.769 --> 02:49:49.412]  One of the many chapters that is in here, and it's clear I'm going to have to have you back up, Mark, in the next few weeks when I get back from Denver to get into some of the other segments.
[02:49:49.412 --> 02:49:52.113]  When we come back, I want to bring Burmese in about the NIST report.
[02:49:52.113 --> 02:49:53.214]  You're a big 9-11 truther.
[02:49:53.214 --> 02:49:57.655]  Get some of your response to that, some of what's in the book, and also play this clip of Jerome Corsi
[02:49:58.856 --> 02:50:00.738]  Uh, you know, denying 9-11 truth.
[02:50:00.738 --> 02:50:05.604]  I'm kind of backpedaling a bit on Hannity and Combs last night where I got brought up.
[02:50:05.604 --> 02:50:12.311]  And, uh, we've got this big guest, uh, Mr. Boyle, Professor Boyle, coming up for the last 52 minutes of the show.
[02:50:12.311 --> 02:50:18.779]  But I want to, we've got two little segments left with you, Mark, and I want to share this with Burmess because we're trying to condense so much into the show.
[02:50:19.830 --> 02:50:22.434]  But your book, I mean, it really condenses it all.
[02:50:22.434 --> 02:50:24.698]  I mean, each chapter is super readable.
[02:50:24.698 --> 02:50:26.401]  It's jam-packed with info.
[02:50:26.401 --> 02:50:27.983]  This is the kind of book I like.
[02:50:27.983 --> 02:50:29.746]  And I just want to commend you for doing such a great job.
[02:50:31.613 --> 02:50:36.056]  And I just want to say, too, because I saw these quotes, I heard these allegations, I didn't believe them.
[02:50:36.056 --> 02:50:43.501]  I spent a lot of money on all these books, and so I pulled out the quotes from their own authors, I put my analysis, I combined a bunch of mainstream news reports with it.
[02:50:43.501 --> 02:50:54.188]  So, instead of supporting these satanic authors and supporting the Church of Satan and going and buying the satanic Bible or his biography to see if what I'm telling you is true, you know, I just ask you to support me and get the manifesto.
[02:50:54.188 --> 02:50:55.989]  And go to the library and read their books.
[02:50:55.989 --> 02:50:57.030]  Don't buy them.
[02:50:57.030 --> 02:50:58.451]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[02:50:58.451 --> 02:51:00.672]  We're going to go live on PrisonPlanet.tv next segment.
[02:51:01.954 --> 02:51:08.723]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:51:08.723 --> 02:51:11.347]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:51:11.347 --> 02:51:12.909]  But who is the enemy?
[02:51:12.909 --> 02:51:13.710]  Bin Laden.
[02:51:13.710 --> 02:51:14.571]  This is his ammo.
[02:51:14.571 --> 02:51:16.074]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:51:16.074 --> 02:51:17.636]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:51:18.056 --> 02:51:25.206]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:51:25.206 --> 02:51:25.687]  Some U.S.
[02:51:25.687 --> 02:51:32.055]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:51:32.055 --> 02:51:35.500]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:51:35.720 --> 02:51:46.004]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:51:46.004 --> 02:51:47.244]  Fabled enemies.
[02:51:47.244 --> 02:51:54.987]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:54.987 --> 02:51:58.348]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:52:01.826 --> 02:52:05.529]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:52:05.529 --> 02:52:07.970]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:52:07.970 --> 02:52:11.433]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:52:11.433 --> 02:52:20.619]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston, online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:52:21.219 --> 02:52:24.582]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:52:24.582 --> 02:52:29.465]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:52:29.465 --> 02:52:34.368]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:52:34.368 --> 02:52:36.950]  Travel less, meet online with Webex.
[02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:40.873]  For as little as $59 a month, about the price of a tank of gas.
[02:52:40.873 --> 02:52:44.115]  You can host unlimited meetings every month from your desktop.
[02:52:44.115 --> 02:52:45.176]  Webex from Cisco.
[02:52:45.336 --> 02:52:45.817]  We're good.
[02:53:02.100 --> 02:53:08.044]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:53:08.044 --> 02:53:12.848]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[02:53:12.848 --> 02:53:18.251]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[02:53:18.251 --> 02:53:21.694]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[02:53:22.174 --> 02:53:30.701]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[02:53:30.701 --> 02:53:36.505]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[02:53:36.505 --> 02:53:42.490]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:53:42.490 --> 02:53:44.812]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[02:53:45.072 --> 02:53:47.733]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[02:53:47.733 --> 02:53:53.474]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[02:53:53.474 --> 02:53:55.635]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[02:54:08.306 --> 02:54:17.253]  Shane Geiger, the InfoWars.com reporter that got his question asked at NIST in our big whitewash, is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[02:54:17.253 --> 02:54:18.975]  We've got Jason Bermas in studio with us.
[02:54:18.975 --> 02:54:21.597]  We're streaming live right now on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:24.912 --> 02:54:26.793]  And we got Jason Burmas in studio with us.
[02:54:26.793 --> 02:54:28.454]  I'm going to miss Jason Burmas.
[02:54:28.454 --> 02:54:36.198]  He's been down here for, what, five plus months, and we just really enjoy having him with us.
[02:54:38.903 --> 02:54:41.844]  And he's going to come back down and make another film with us next year.
[02:54:41.844 --> 02:54:53.770]  I've really gotten attached to having Burmy, he hates that nickname, everybody needs to start using it, here with us in town, but he'll be back with the InfoWars team.
[02:54:53.770 --> 02:54:55.951]  But we've got Mark Dice, who I want to have
[02:54:56.551 --> 02:55:00.472]  Again, on, talk about his book when I get back into town.
[02:55:00.472 --> 02:55:02.653]  But right now, I wanted to play some audio.
[02:55:02.653 --> 02:55:03.973]  The video is up on YouTube.
[02:55:03.973 --> 02:55:05.413]  We're going to get it posted.
[02:55:05.413 --> 02:55:06.593]  And they talk about me a bunch.
[02:55:06.593 --> 02:55:10.354]  They talk about his evil, saying he wants to investigate 9-11.
[02:55:10.354 --> 02:55:11.995]  He does backpedal.
[02:55:11.995 --> 02:55:15.796]  He does say, basically, that it points towards inside job, and he was on my show.
[02:55:15.796 --> 02:55:17.476]  So, drum course, he is backpedaling.
[02:55:17.476 --> 02:55:20.737]  It's all over the New York Times, you name it.
[02:55:20.737 --> 02:55:22.897]  They're really trying to attack him that way.
[02:55:22.897 --> 02:55:24.518]  So, let's go ahead and play about a minute of this.
[02:55:24.518 --> 02:55:24.918]  Here it is.
[02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:29.794]  Last week, the Obama campaign released a 40-page manifesto criticizing the book.
[02:55:29.794 --> 02:55:34.157]  Joining us now to respond to these attacks is Jerome Corsi.
[02:55:34.157 --> 02:55:36.199]  I would propose that you've attacked Obama.
[02:55:36.199 --> 02:55:37.741]  You started the attacks.
[02:55:37.741 --> 02:55:41.064]  Here is some of the stuff that Obama has talked about.
[02:55:41.064 --> 02:55:41.284]  Sure.
[02:55:41.284 --> 02:55:43.606]  And some of the things that... We've already covered a lot of this in your book.
[02:55:43.606 --> 02:55:44.647]  We've gone through some of the crazy
[02:55:45.027 --> 02:55:49.269]  Some of the things you've said, for example, about John McCain.
[02:55:49.269 --> 02:55:56.712]  You said, as John McCain assumes a GOP frontrunner mantle, his little nose association with donors like George Soros and Theresa Hines carry.
[02:55:56.712 --> 02:56:01.033]  We're not talking about McCain.
[02:56:01.033 --> 02:56:06.976]  I've got a bunch of friends who are emailing me saying, is there any way that I can get Senator Obama to attack their book?
[02:56:06.976 --> 02:56:11.197]  But you also said John McCain's personal fortune traces back to organized crime in America.
[02:56:11.197 --> 02:56:12.618]  You've really gone after John McCain?
[02:56:13.118 --> 02:56:14.420]  I'm not voting for John McCain.
[02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:16.162]  I've attacked George W. Bush.
[02:56:16.162 --> 02:56:18.264]  Look at my last book, The Late Great USA.
[02:56:18.264 --> 02:56:20.547]  It became a New York Times Best Seller, too.
[02:56:20.547 --> 02:56:24.071]  And, you know, Alan, I'm going to vote for Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party.
[02:56:24.071 --> 02:56:27.515]  I wrote this book that I think the most dangerous candidate running.
[02:56:28.095 --> 02:56:30.016]  So far left is Barack Obama.
[02:56:30.016 --> 02:56:32.818]  The Obama people have all pointed out some of the other things you've done.
[02:56:32.818 --> 02:56:39.563]  For example, you had a project you were planning for January to expose what you call the government's inedible explanations about 9-11 attacks.
[02:56:39.563 --> 02:56:41.584]  Well, you know, Alan, they should have researched more of that article.
[02:56:41.584 --> 02:56:42.605]  It never got published.
[02:56:42.605 --> 02:56:43.906]  Well, they never publish it, but you're right.
[02:56:45.387 --> 02:56:46.788]  No, no.
[02:56:46.788 --> 02:56:50.109]  If they'd researched it, I withdrew the article because I was not convinced by the evidence.
[02:56:50.109 --> 02:56:53.571]  And you were on Alex Jones' show, you were discussing the findings of Stephen Jones, the physicist.
[02:56:53.571 --> 02:56:54.831]  Well, that's real partial.
[02:56:54.831 --> 02:56:55.532]  I didn't publish it.
[02:56:55.532 --> 02:56:55.972]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:56:55.972 --> 02:57:04.336]  Because he's considered a hero of the 9-11 truth movement, and you were defending his claim that there was evidence that the World Trade Center collapsed because of explosives inside the building.
[02:57:04.336 --> 02:57:05.736]  We didn't publish it, Alan.
[02:57:05.736 --> 02:57:06.177]  We withdrew it.
[02:57:07.017 --> 02:57:08.118]  No, I withdrew the article.
[02:57:08.118 --> 02:57:14.223]  I published instead an article, which they didn't, the Obama camp didn't find, validating the findings of the article.
[02:57:14.223 --> 02:57:17.947]  I'm not talking about what you said on Alex Jones' show, which is on tape, defending that position.
[02:57:17.947 --> 02:57:19.168]  I investigated a lot of issues.
[02:57:19.168 --> 02:57:20.209]  I withdrew it.
[02:57:20.209 --> 02:57:21.730]  It never got published.
[02:57:21.730 --> 02:57:23.912]  Alex was interviewing me in the middle of research.
[02:57:23.912 --> 02:57:29.817]  And by the way, Alan, that research would not have supported this whole crazy idea that the government caused 9-11.
[02:57:29.817 --> 02:57:33.200]  It might have said that there was some evidence yet to look at and some questions to raise.
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:37.123]  I've never published anything in support of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:37.123 --> 02:57:38.564]  You're misinterpreting that.
[02:57:38.564 --> 02:57:42.046]  I said I was looking at the evidence, Alan, and we didn't publish it.
[02:57:42.046 --> 02:57:45.429]  You were defending what physicists said.
[02:57:45.429 --> 02:57:48.551]  Now I'm like Pastor Wright or something.
[02:57:48.551 --> 02:57:49.492]  But on Courtesy.
[02:57:50.743 --> 02:57:51.664]  And it goes on and on.
[02:57:51.664 --> 02:57:53.727]  We'll play more of it later if we have to.
[02:57:53.727 --> 02:57:57.371]  We have an anthrax expert coming up with really bombshell info.
[02:57:57.371 --> 02:57:59.674]  I want to say bottom mark dice.
[02:57:59.674 --> 02:58:06.301]  We also have the reporter, Shane Geiger, InfoWars reporter, that really did a great job confronting the NIS report today.
[02:58:06.301 --> 02:58:07.603]  It's all coming up.
[02:58:07.603 --> 02:58:08.124]  Stay with us.
[02:58:11.201 --> 02:58:12.862]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:12.862 --> 02:58:14.682]  Alright, let's keep rolling.
[02:58:14.682 --> 02:58:17.063]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:17.063 --> 02:58:17.843]  Yeah, let's keep rolling.
[02:58:17.843 --> 02:58:20.784]  I want to talk to Dice now.
[02:58:20.784 --> 02:58:22.745]  Let me talk to Mark right now.
[02:58:22.745 --> 02:58:25.126]  Thanks.
[02:58:25.126 --> 02:58:26.046]  Hey, Mark?
[02:58:26.046 --> 02:58:26.686]  Yeah?
[02:58:26.686 --> 02:58:33.228]  Yeah, we're still on air right now at PrisonPlanet.tv, just to let you know we're back live with a full AM and FM audience in one minute.
[02:58:33.228 --> 02:58:37.490]  Yeah, let me just get you on, not next week because I'm out of town, but the week after.
[02:58:37.490 --> 02:58:40.231]  And I do want to carry the Resistance Manifesto.
[02:58:40.891 --> 02:58:42.972]  Your first one was great, but this one's even better.
[02:58:42.972 --> 02:58:45.754]  So I need to talk to you about that today to get that nailed down.
[02:58:45.754 --> 02:58:49.837]  But just go ahead and mail me 200 of these bad boys.
[02:58:49.837 --> 02:58:52.239]  And I just want to really thank you for all you've done.
[02:58:52.239 --> 02:58:58.223]  I want you to come back and, you know, briefly comment on the 9-11 situation with Bermas.
[02:58:58.223 --> 02:59:03.006]  Then I want to get this other reporter up, Shane Geiger, who got into the NIS folks.
[02:59:03.006 --> 02:59:10.371]  And then make sure, John, that Trey has called Professor Boyle to move him to about 15 after.
[02:59:11.511 --> 02:59:12.072]  Okay.
[02:59:12.072 --> 02:59:13.493]  Alright, here we go folks.
[02:59:13.493 --> 02:59:15.674]  Total transparency behind the scenes.
[02:59:15.674 --> 02:59:21.238]  We're coming back live with Bernie, Mark Dice, and of course Shane Geiger.
[02:59:21.238 --> 02:59:23.099]  Stay with us.
[02:59:23.099 --> 02:59:24.920]  War on Corruption.
[02:59:24.920 --> 02:59:27.482]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:27.482 --> 02:59:28.443]  Now we got Derek out there.
[02:59:39.341 --> 02:59:41.642]  Get ready for Real Talk Radio.
[02:59:41.642 --> 02:59:44.504]  That's what this radio transmission has always been about.
[02:59:44.504 --> 02:59:47.886]  It's really the original name of this radio show.
[02:59:47.886 --> 02:59:50.027]  It's also been called the Final Edition.
[02:59:50.027 --> 02:59:53.929]  You know, when I would do the last live show at a local station.
[02:59:53.929 --> 02:59:56.450]  Okay, we got Mark Dice with us, the resistance band Mephisto.
[02:59:56.450 --> 02:59:57.531]  We're gonna have him back on.
[02:59:57.531 --> 02:59:58.612]  Get it at markdice.com.
[03:00:00.421 --> 03:00:02.702]  I want to shift into 9-11.
[03:00:02.702 --> 03:00:08.644]  Burmess, what do you think of Mr. Corsi, and what do you think of Mark Dice and what we just heard with him?
[03:00:08.644 --> 03:00:09.965]  It's throwing me under the bus.
[03:00:09.965 --> 03:00:15.947]  Oh, he's definitely throwing you under the bus a wee bit, but also, you know, I think Combs is throwing you under the bus.
[03:00:15.947 --> 03:00:18.528]  He also was contacted by you, has been on the show.
[03:00:19.108 --> 03:00:38.635]  And, you know, he's the little Democratic cheerleader there, the little psy-op on that end of the spectrum, and he just loves to use you to discredit people, when in fact, Corsi a couple times just tried to say, look, I'm looking at the physicist's evidence, and of course he did have to back-paddle and say, maybe there were some unanswered questions, but I'm saying that, you know, there's no way that the government helped cause 9-1-1.
[03:00:38.635 --> 03:00:44.257]  And by the way, Corsi says his publisher will, quote, not let him come on the show, when he's under contract.
[03:00:44.557 --> 03:00:47.858]  Well, I mean, you got snubbed on Geraldo the other day and other Fox News.
[03:00:47.858 --> 03:00:49.719]  Yeah, they drove me down there, had me sit there.
[03:00:49.719 --> 03:00:51.740]  That's why I've always refused to fly there.
[03:00:51.740 --> 03:00:55.541]  They're always trying to get me to fly to New York, like it's some Murdoch joke.
[03:00:55.541 --> 03:00:57.602]  And the last guy I sent up there, the plane almost crashed.
[03:00:57.602 --> 03:01:00.503]  It was like dropping 2,000 feet in thunderstorms.
[03:01:00.503 --> 03:01:01.504]  I'm sure that's a coincidence.
[03:01:01.504 --> 03:01:03.124]  Of course it is, yeah.
[03:01:03.124 --> 03:01:08.346]  You've probably got some New World Order person down there in a witch's hat and a thing like, ahhh, Xaramon!
[03:01:08.346 --> 03:01:10.727]  That'll get you, Jones!
[03:01:10.727 --> 03:01:11.647]  Anyways, it's crazy.
[03:01:11.647 --> 03:01:12.868]  Mark Dye's final comments.
[03:01:14.582 --> 03:01:29.090]  I want to announce, and I'll do this when I'm back on your show in a couple weeks, for, you know, 9-11, the anniversary's coming up here in about three weeks, and for those who can't make it to New York, or who can't go out to a local rally, or who just want to get involved but don't know what to do, I want to just announce Operation Phone Mob.
[03:01:29.090 --> 03:01:31.931]  So, I think on 9-11, it's a Thursday.
[03:01:31.931 --> 03:01:34.653]  Details will be posted at MarkDice.com.
[03:01:34.653 --> 03:01:36.094]  I'll email that out to everybody.
[03:01:36.094 --> 03:01:39.996]  I think that we need to get hundreds of people to call into the radio talk shows on that day.
[03:01:40.478 --> 03:01:42.761]  And what do you think of Corsi?
[03:01:42.761 --> 03:01:44.764]  I mean, this is becoming a big issue.
[03:01:49.758 --> 03:01:58.381]  You know, there was some cross-talk there between him and Combs, but he said, I don't know if people made it out, but he said he's never written anything in support of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[03:01:58.381 --> 03:02:04.222]  So, he's in a rough position, but again, he's got a lot of responsibility.
[03:02:04.222 --> 03:02:05.223]  He probably knows the truth.
[03:02:05.223 --> 03:02:12.645]  Yeah, he's the darling of the hardcore neocons, and then he's saying he's looking at Evans of Inside Job.
[03:02:13.385 --> 03:02:16.107]  And they're saying he's delusional about the North American Union.
[03:02:16.107 --> 03:02:16.747]  You know what it is?
[03:02:16.747 --> 03:02:29.135]  It's almost like when Ron Paul was initially interviewed by student scholars and he said he would support a new investigation, although he didn't believe that it would really tell the truth, and then he'd even have to backpedal from that position when he got bigger.
[03:02:29.135 --> 03:02:33.818]  Well, of course he was able to come on your show, talk about thermite, but now that he's a New York Times No.
[03:02:33.818 --> 03:02:39.882]  1 bestseller and he's on all these shows, it's time to back off a bit, because 9-11 truth is just still too hot for some people.
[03:02:40.723 --> 03:02:41.584]  Oh yeah, they all know.
[03:02:41.584 --> 03:02:43.987]  They all know, every single one of them.
[03:02:51.337 --> 03:02:56.279]  You know, I understand that his publisher is trying to backpedal and protect their financial net.
[03:02:56.279 --> 03:03:03.422]  Well, I mean, he's always asking to come on the show because he knows my audience, with a few other shows, can push it up the New York Times bestseller list.
[03:03:03.422 --> 03:03:07.063]  And I think his book's important, and you know, he's being attacked for saying it's disinfo.
[03:03:07.063 --> 03:03:09.905]  No, they're not attacking him on the book itself.
[03:03:09.905 --> 03:03:14.526]  They're attacking him on North American Union or 9-11.
[03:03:14.526 --> 03:03:16.307]  And so that's another issue.
[03:03:16.307 --> 03:03:20.629]  Why aren't they attacking him on the issues the book covers, Burmy?
[03:03:21.189 --> 03:03:28.253]  Well, I mean, they got some minute errors in there and they blow them out of proportion for the book, but like you said, they don't want to address the main stuff.
[03:03:28.253 --> 03:03:35.358]  I mean, he does get in the SPP right after the discussion about you on Hannity and Combs, you know, Securities and Prosperities Partnership.
[03:03:35.358 --> 03:03:37.119]  So the guy's obviously very, very smart.
[03:03:37.119 --> 03:03:39.120]  He's very, very hip to what this movement's doing.
[03:03:39.720 --> 03:03:42.442]  I do hope he comes out a little stronger for 9-11 Truth.
[03:03:42.442 --> 03:03:44.023]  I don't expect it.
[03:03:44.023 --> 03:03:45.384]  His words can't be taken back.
[03:03:45.384 --> 03:03:48.786]  That interview with you is monumental and should be played all over the place.
[03:03:48.786 --> 03:03:50.547]  I mean, let's be honest.
[03:03:50.547 --> 03:03:53.489]  Without 9-11 Truth, we're never going to take this country back.
[03:03:53.489 --> 03:03:54.530]  They're going to keep staging more.
[03:03:54.530 --> 03:03:57.312]  Yeah, and he can vote for Chuck Baldwin all he wants.
[03:03:57.312 --> 03:03:58.413]  It's not going to help us.
[03:03:58.413 --> 03:04:00.474]  And Chuck Baldwin is an admitted 9-11 Truther.
[03:04:00.474 --> 03:04:02.315]  He knows all about the New World Order.
[03:04:02.315 --> 03:04:04.437]  Oh, that's a nexus point.
[03:04:04.437 --> 03:04:05.697]  Yeah, of course.
[03:04:05.697 --> 03:04:06.458]  Let's just go ahead and do it.
[03:04:06.838 --> 03:04:10.879]  Dr. Corsi denies 9-11 Truth but supports 9-11 Truth candidate.
[03:04:10.879 --> 03:04:13.259]  Hey, Mark Dice, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:04:13.259 --> 03:04:14.099]  No problem.
[03:04:14.099 --> 03:04:14.640]  Good to have you here.
[03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:16.740]  We'll have you back up in two weeks, week and a half.
[03:04:16.740 --> 03:04:18.560]  There he goes, great guy.
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:21.681]  Mark Dice, ResistanceManifesto.com, MarkDice.com.
[03:04:21.681 --> 03:04:25.122]  My website's InfoWars.com, BurmaSaysIsBurmy.com.
[03:04:25.122 --> 03:04:28.242]  We'll be right back with Derek and the whole crew.
[03:04:28.242 --> 03:04:29.122]  Stay with us.
[03:04:29.122 --> 03:04:29.943]  Oh, and we have a reporter.
[03:04:29.943 --> 03:04:36.384]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:04:36.804 --> 03:04:39.625]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:04:39.625 --> 03:04:40.986]  Who is the enemy?
[03:04:40.986 --> 03:04:41.786]  Bin Laden.
[03:04:41.786 --> 03:04:42.666]  This is his M.O.
[03:04:42.666 --> 03:04:44.147]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:04:44.147 --> 03:04:46.148]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:04:46.148 --> 03:04:53.310]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:04:53.310 --> 03:04:53.771]  Some U.S.
[03:04:53.771 --> 03:04:59.433]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:05:00.133 --> 03:05:03.635]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:05:03.635 --> 03:05:06.437]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:05:30.407 --> 03:05:35.830]  If this is your paycheck and this is your debt, what are your options?
[03:05:35.830 --> 03:05:40.912]  File bankruptcy and tread water the next seven years?

[03:06:25.842 --> 03:06:28.844]  Details are available.
[03:06:28.844 --> 03:06:29.765]  For Boyle.

[03:07:05.661 --> 03:07:11.305]  Stress increases blood pressure, potential heart problems, strokes, ulcers, depression, and insomnia.
[03:07:11.305 --> 03:07:14.567]  Stress suppresses your immune system and inhibits weight control.
[03:07:14.567 --> 03:07:15.948]  Stress makes you nervous.

[03:07:33.218 --> 03:07:36.560]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:36.560 --> 03:07:41.243]  We have Professor Francis A. Boyle joining us in about five minutes.
[03:07:41.243 --> 03:07:44.204]  By the way, I'm on in Toronto tonight for an hour with Richard Serra.
[03:07:44.204 --> 03:07:46.846]  I'm going to plug that for listeners who want to hear that.
[03:07:46.846 --> 03:07:50.208]  Francis Boyle with huge anthrax news in T-minus five minutes.
[03:07:50.208 --> 03:07:52.189]  Finishing up with Jason Burmess.
[03:07:52.189 --> 03:07:54.831]  His new film, Fabled Enemy, is coming out in ten days.
[03:07:54.831 --> 03:07:56.552]  See it at PrisonPlanet.tv first.
[03:07:56.552 --> 03:07:57.693]  Pre-order the DVD now.
[03:07:57.693 --> 03:07:59.093]  Ships out September 1st.
[03:08:00.494 --> 03:08:04.317]  Going to Shane Geiger, who I appreciate holding.
[03:08:04.317 --> 03:08:07.519]  Shane just popped by and said, can I say I'm an InfoWars freelance reporter?
[03:08:07.519 --> 03:08:08.640]  We said sure.
[03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:11.541]  They called and checked with NIST that he really was going.
[03:08:11.541 --> 03:08:15.384]  They had their little meeting, he got his question out, and they shut him down.
[03:08:15.384 --> 03:08:24.990]  So just giving some background, Shane Geiger, tell listeners what happened, where this was, how you got the question in, and what happened.
[03:08:24.990 --> 03:08:27.111]  Hi Alex, thanks so much for having me on the show.
[03:08:27.111 --> 03:08:27.512]  Oh thank you.
[03:08:29.174 --> 03:08:30.014]  Yeah, it's a pleasure.
[03:08:30.014 --> 03:08:36.156]  You know, I was basically making some statements that were backed up.
[03:08:36.156 --> 03:08:38.016]  I mean, this is fact.
[03:08:38.016 --> 03:08:51.419]  I was just stating what had been in the Twin Towers report, and then I stated some things about the back and forth between the Stephen Jones camp and this.
[03:08:51.419 --> 03:08:54.240]  Stephen Jones did a Data Quality Assurance Act request.
[03:08:55.151 --> 03:09:10.741]  And NIST replied back in September of 2007 stating that they are unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse, and they also stated that they did not conduct tests for explosive residue.
[03:09:10.741 --> 03:09:22.089]  Yeah, they won't do mathematic equations, they'll just show us video computer composites that any 14-year-old with a case of Hot Pockets and Jolt Cola can make.
[03:09:23.331 --> 03:09:29.773]  Right, so this should sound very familiar to NIST because, you know, they were involved in this back and forth.
[03:09:29.773 --> 03:09:36.374]  And yet, this was at the point in my questioning where I was basically shut down.
[03:09:36.374 --> 03:09:39.275]  And I had a few other things I tried to get out after that.
[03:09:39.275 --> 03:09:46.257]  I'm very interested in the scientific method being applied to the research of all the 9-11
[03:09:48.061 --> 03:09:50.442]  Yeah, we were in this 11-story, nondescript building on the NIST campus.
[03:09:50.442 --> 03:09:51.362]  I'm glad it didn't collapse on us.
[03:09:51.362 --> 03:09:53.622]  It probably would have collapsed in about two or three seconds.
[03:10:15.363 --> 03:10:17.844]  Yeah, well, it was just kind of surreal.
[03:10:17.844 --> 03:10:28.829]  I was there among reporters from the AP, New York Times, Fox, the ZDF, which is the second station in Germany.
[03:10:28.829 --> 03:10:36.513]  I was actually talking after the event with somebody who's involved in the making of the third tower.
[03:10:36.513 --> 03:10:40.115]  So he's working with Mike Rudin of the BBC.
[03:10:40.115 --> 03:10:42.876]  So I got a lot of, it was really great to get some
[03:10:43.661 --> 03:10:44.622]  Media contacts.
[03:10:44.622 --> 03:10:46.783]  Thanks so much for that, Alex.
[03:10:46.783 --> 03:10:55.928]  And I was just, I was surrounded by all these people who, you know, obviously have an axe to grind.
[03:10:55.928 --> 03:11:02.472]  These people were sort of, you know, standoffish and it was not really a friendly environment.
[03:11:02.472 --> 03:11:11.237]  In fact, I think it was somewhat telling that as soon as I started, you know, calling NIST on these bear assertions,
[03:11:11.727 --> 03:11:21.675]  The lights actually went out in the room, so it was a little unfriendly from that second on, and the microphone started moving away from me.
[03:11:21.675 --> 03:11:25.578]  This is just totally ridiculous.
[03:11:25.578 --> 03:11:33.224]  I travel halfway across the country to ask questions, and I have to show up under the pretext of being a reporter.
[03:11:33.900 --> 03:11:36.401]  When it's not enough to be a concerned U.S.
[03:11:36.401 --> 03:11:37.801]  citizen to show up here.
[03:11:52.685 --> 03:12:10.975]  Yeah, yeah, the south face of the building and we have the videos where there's a few windows blown out but we obviously see the guy walk into the building and then go up the escalator into the main lobby so there's not, well I believe what they said was a quarter of the building or somewhere between 10 and 12 stories scooped out of the building while their new model has no scoop out and they don't even claim...
[03:12:12.676 --> 03:12:18.859]  There's no scoop-out, they don't even mention the quote-unquote scoop-out, so they've retracted that statement.
[03:12:18.859 --> 03:12:24.323]  Now they're also saying it wasn't the fuel oil tanks, and they're also saying it's unbelievable what this actually comes down to.
[03:12:24.323 --> 03:12:25.263]  Wasn't the cable rails?
[03:12:25.263 --> 03:12:34.709]  Well, they're saying that although no other building has even come close to this kind of structural damage, I guess, from hundreds of degrees less than known fires, that's what did it.
[03:12:34.709 --> 03:12:36.710]  It was the thermal expansion of columns
[03:12:37.290 --> 03:12:37.970]  We're good to go.
[03:13:02.841 --> 03:13:07.767]  Of course, these guys all happen to be top experts in explosive thermate when no one else is.
[03:13:07.767 --> 03:13:10.751]  It just so happens they're top experts.
[03:13:10.751 --> 03:13:13.714]  Yeah, and you know, again, the molten metal is never addressed.
[03:13:13.714 --> 03:13:15.056]  It's not addressed in this.
[03:13:15.056 --> 03:13:21.304]  And now they're making it into a standards issue and saying that skyscrapers need to re-evaluate how they've been built.
[03:13:21.604 --> 03:13:22.705]  I mean, it's a total lie!
[03:13:22.705 --> 03:13:30.612]  Plus, this thing had a special bunker built inside of it to withstand nuclear attacks, but it magically put a big lighter to it and it just exploded.
[03:13:30.612 --> 03:13:38.078]  You know what's really upsetting is that, again, this was New York's number one spook house, located in the center of Manhattan.
[03:13:38.078 --> 03:13:41.140]  Largest CIA base outside of Langley, Virginia.
[03:13:41.140 --> 03:13:41.621]  FBI.
[03:13:41.621 --> 03:13:44.203]  Largest Secret Service office in the world.
[03:13:44.203 --> 03:13:44.884]  Armored bunker.
[03:13:45.504 --> 03:13:47.206]  And the Office of Emergency Management.
[03:13:47.206 --> 03:13:49.788]  But now the building has a small fire and it's falling on its own.
[03:13:49.788 --> 03:13:53.892]  Well, the Office of Emergency Management was also hooked into the Pentagon 24-7.
[03:13:53.892 --> 03:13:55.493]  We show that in Fabled Enemies.
[03:13:55.493 --> 03:13:58.976]  And it had blueprints of every single building in New York City.
[03:13:58.976 --> 03:14:10.987]  And in Fabled Enemies, we show you how immediately after the building collapsed, the FBI set up teams with binoculars watching the rescue workers to make sure they didn't take anything out of that building that was incriminating.
[03:14:11.147 --> 03:14:11.547]  No, no.
[03:14:11.547 --> 03:14:15.549]  Jason, I want you to set up InfoWars reporter Shane Geiger for 30 minutes tomorrow.
[03:14:15.549 --> 03:14:17.270]  You're sitting in for me as I get ready to go to Denver.
[03:14:17.270 --> 03:14:20.892]  We need to go to Professor Francis A. Boyle here in just a moment.
[03:14:20.892 --> 03:14:21.352]  Do we have him?
[03:14:22.864 --> 03:14:23.505]  Yes, he's all set.
[03:14:23.505 --> 03:14:23.985]  Okay, good.
[03:14:23.985 --> 03:14:25.566]  I don't want to make him hold anymore.
[03:14:25.566 --> 03:14:28.329]  We just got overbooked today and his information is so important.
[03:14:28.329 --> 03:14:34.434]  Shane, let me set you up, because you went to the SNS report for 30 minutes tomorrow, at least with Jason.
[03:14:34.434 --> 03:14:38.678]  So let me have Trey and Jason right now call you and get that set up.
[03:14:38.678 --> 03:14:40.359]  Thank you, Jason Burmess, for that information.
[03:14:40.359 --> 03:14:40.639]  Thank you.
[03:14:41.400 --> 03:14:44.162]  Alright, this is a very, very serious issue.
[03:14:44.162 --> 03:14:48.485]  Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize, I was screwing around earlier here in the studio, but Jason's about to leave town.
[03:14:48.485 --> 03:14:50.927]  He's been with us for five months, so we're just having some fun.
[03:14:50.927 --> 03:14:51.867]  Very, very dark times.
[03:14:51.867 --> 03:14:55.229]  Very, very serious things that we are dealing with here.
[03:14:55.229 --> 03:14:56.530]  Thank you, Shane Geiger.
[03:14:56.530 --> 03:14:57.291]  We'll talk to you tomorrow.
[03:14:58.604 --> 03:14:59.605]  It was a pleasure, Alex.
[03:14:59.605 --> 03:14:59.925]  You bet.
[03:14:59.925 --> 03:15:00.265]  Thank you.
[03:15:00.265 --> 03:15:02.607]  You can go through it all tomorrow with people.
[03:15:02.607 --> 03:15:04.788]  Okay, for the next 45 minutes, I am very honored.
[03:15:04.788 --> 03:15:13.274]  We're going to skip a few of the breaks for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InfoWars.com streamlisters because this is too important information in the time we have left.
[03:15:13.274 --> 03:15:20.399]  If I went over Professor Boyle's bio, it would take hours, but he's written international weapons, bioweapons conventions.
[03:15:20.399 --> 03:15:23.942]  He's been a top-level analyst for the federal government in that capacity.
[03:15:25.122 --> 03:15:29.805]  It just goes on and on with his lengthy bio.
[03:15:29.805 --> 03:15:44.492]  And last time he was on with us, I guess about a year and a half ago, an article that Steve Watson wrote about it was published in scores of newspapers and one of the largest magazines in the country and some foreign newspapers as well, dealing with the fact that he was saying the anthrax was an inside job.
[03:15:44.492 --> 03:15:48.735]  Now I've got my mother-in-law that doesn't even believe my show calling up thinking the government did it.
[03:15:49.495 --> 03:15:51.356]  She'll be put on the list now, I'm sure.
[03:15:51.356 --> 03:15:55.479]  Now I've got just all over, everyone's saying it's complete bull.
[03:15:55.479 --> 03:15:57.400]  Mainstream media is saying it's complete bull.
[03:15:57.400 --> 03:15:58.681]  You look at the whole story.
[03:15:58.681 --> 03:16:06.946]  They grab this other patsy, put him in the hospital, murder him, clearly, then say that he was always who they knew did it, while they persecuted Steven Hatfield.
[03:16:06.946 --> 03:16:14.831]  We have this other guy, Dr. Philip Zack, breaking in to the bioweapons lab when he didn't even work there, not getting in trouble, still at another bioweapons lab.
[03:16:15.071 --> 03:16:16.432]  It's the most weaponized U.S.
[03:16:16.432 --> 03:16:17.593]  anthrax ever seen.
[03:16:17.593 --> 03:16:28.500]  The FBI destroys the original samples so that it can't be proven, and so they can claim that this Dr. Ivins cooked it up in his bathtub or in a basement.
[03:16:28.500 --> 03:16:31.743]  Just the miniaturization process takes over $100 million worth of equipment.
[03:16:31.743 --> 03:16:34.544]  It's the size of a gymnasium.
[03:16:34.544 --> 03:16:37.667]  It just goes on and on, but we have a bioweapons expert on with us.
[03:16:37.667 --> 03:16:40.168]  Sir, I know you don't like talking about yourself, but we're about to break.
[03:16:41.289 --> 03:16:51.076]  Give us some of your background, though, and your expertise on this and your bold stance a year and a half ago that's now being echoed by people at Fort Detrick saying Ivans couldn't have done this.
[03:16:51.076 --> 03:16:56.661]  And, you know, as the plot really thickens and as their cover-up implodes.
[03:16:56.661 --> 03:16:57.061]  Right.
[03:16:57.061 --> 03:17:05.187]  Well, the day the technology on the Daschle letter was revealed in the New York Times
[03:17:06.435 --> 03:17:15.645]  I immediately called Marion Spike Bowman, who is a high-level counterintelligence official at the FBI.
[03:17:15.645 --> 03:17:26.095]  And in fact, it turns out, was also the person who spiked the FBI's warrant for the Moussaoui computer.
[03:17:26.095 --> 03:17:27.817]  But that's another issue.
[03:17:27.817 --> 03:17:29.899]  But before we go, tell folks who you are.
[03:17:31.455 --> 03:17:34.056]  Well, I'm getting to that.
[03:17:34.056 --> 03:17:54.022]  He knew me because I had drafted the United States Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 that was passed unanimously by both houses of the United States Congress and signed into law by President Bush Sr.
[03:17:54.022 --> 03:17:56.062]  That legislation was the U.S.
[03:17:56.062 --> 03:18:00.864]  domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention
[03:18:01.738 --> 03:18:12.085]  And Mr. Bowman and I had met each other at a terrorism conference at the University of Michigan Law School.
[03:18:12.085 --> 03:18:30.958]  In any event, I told Mr. Bowman, this was in October of 2001, that the only people who had the capability to do this would be those individuals working at either United States government labs
[03:18:31.947 --> 03:18:56.621]  uh... or uh... private contractors uh... and things of this nature and that it obviously uh... seem to me this was u s government uh... related um... he took the uh... information down and uh... said he would pass it on to the appropriate people handing the handling the investigation i hung up
[03:18:57.572 --> 03:19:04.277]  And then it occurred to me that I had a complete list of who all these people were and what these labs were.
[03:19:05.343 --> 03:19:09.324]  Going back to my work on getting the legislation through.
[03:19:09.324 --> 03:19:09.964]  Absolutely.
[03:19:09.964 --> 03:19:29.790]  We're going to skip this break for stations out there, and then just come right back in to the main segment in four minutes with our guest, a really top bioweapons expert, helped write some of the major international treaties for the United States, Francis A. Boyle, and we are continuing skipping this break.
[03:19:29.790 --> 03:19:32.751]  Okay, Mr. Boyle, continue.
[03:19:32.751 --> 03:19:33.351]  Oh, sure.
[03:19:35.510 --> 03:19:45.192]  I called him back and I said, you know, I have a complete list here of when the program was in the public record.
[03:19:45.192 --> 03:19:49.273]  And here's some of the names and some of the facilities.
[03:19:49.273 --> 03:19:58.496]  And I went through, through not all of it, but I went, you know, I went down the list and I told him where he could get this list.
[03:19:58.496 --> 03:20:04.137]  And then I said, and it's also been reported this summer that the CIA was engaged in a
[03:20:04.964 --> 03:20:09.685]  uh... anthrax work as well uh... you could get the uh... c.i.a.
[03:20:09.685 --> 03:20:13.247]  list from the uh... from the c.i.a.
[03:20:13.247 --> 03:20:18.928]  and then you know we talked some more and he said well he you know the f.b.i.
[03:20:18.928 --> 03:20:31.592]  was was working with fort detrick and i said well fort detrick could very well be the problem here uh... that you had uh... someone like a timothy mcveigh
[03:20:32.304 --> 03:20:37.665]  Who was once on the reservation and now off the reservation.
[03:20:37.665 --> 03:20:43.647]  So, he said again he would communicate this to the people in charge of the investigation.
[03:20:43.647 --> 03:20:59.811]  Instead they ran around everywhere saying that it was somebody in a bathtub or in a bucket making it, and now we know the White House ordered Robert Mueller to say it was Iraq, that it was Al Qaeda, and boy that really shows them being complicit, but please continue.
[03:21:00.885 --> 03:21:13.851]  Well, it was even worse than that, Alex, in that at that point, you know, I had assumed good faith on the part of the FBI in this investigation because, you know, it had killed several people.
[03:21:13.851 --> 03:21:24.236]  It had shut down the United States Congress, which I think was probably the greatest political crime ever inflicted on our republic in its history.
[03:21:26.132 --> 03:21:33.937]  But then I read that the FBI had authorized the destruction of the U.S.
[03:21:33.937 --> 03:21:40.340]  government's Ames Strain collection in Ames, Iowa.
[03:21:40.340 --> 03:21:45.803]  Ames Strain was the strain responsible for U.S.
[03:21:45.803 --> 03:21:47.704]  biowarfare programs.
[03:21:47.704 --> 03:21:50.046]  Everyone knew that.
[03:21:50.046 --> 03:21:52.207]  And indeed, that's all now been confirmed.
[03:21:52.207 --> 03:21:54.168]  You can read it in today's New York Times.
[03:21:54.168 --> 03:21:55.349]  There's a story right in there.
[03:21:56.332 --> 03:22:01.334]  Of course, we all said this six and a half years ago, but we're still kooks.
[03:22:01.334 --> 03:22:01.674]  Right.
[03:22:01.674 --> 03:22:25.625]  So, when I read the FBI had destroyed the entire Ames Strain collection in Ames, Iowa, I knew a cover-up was underway because you could have taken the FBI, legitimate scientific researchers could have taken that collection and used it to genetically reconstruct
[03:22:26.351 --> 03:22:34.354]  Precisely where and when and how the weapon came from.
[03:22:34.354 --> 03:22:36.375]  And they destroyed it.
[03:22:36.375 --> 03:22:41.116]  This was clearly a federal crime in its own right.
[03:22:41.116 --> 03:22:42.977]  Destruction of justice.
[03:22:42.977 --> 03:22:48.159]  So it was obvious that that evidence all should have been preserved as evidence of a crime.
[03:22:48.159 --> 03:22:54.281]  I used to teach criminal law here, so it was obvious they were covering up and covering up
[03:22:55.376 --> 03:22:55.576]  I think
[03:23:15.729 --> 03:23:21.392]  instance of destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice by the FBI.
[03:23:21.392 --> 03:23:23.453]  As hurriedly as they could.
[03:23:23.453 --> 03:23:29.717]  Okay, we're going to come back in with some stations joining us to continue right now with our guest.
[03:23:43.331 --> 03:23:48.632]  Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law.
[03:23:48.632 --> 03:23:51.833]  He's a graduate of the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School.
[03:23:51.833 --> 03:23:58.014]  He's also received a PhD in political science from Harvard University and he has
[03:24:00.481 --> 03:24:11.765]  Just had a bio, it's too long to go over, but he's written international bioweapons conventions for the Federal Government, advised Congress, written some of the biggest publications out there.
[03:24:11.765 --> 03:24:15.186]  The list just goes on and on.
[03:24:15.186 --> 03:24:20.968]  He's currently a member of the Nobel Prize for Governor George H. Ryan Committee.
[03:24:22.426 --> 03:24:30.053]  Okay, continuing, sir, with the FBI covering up this evidence, covering up the original AIM strain, destroying them.
[03:24:30.053 --> 03:24:34.176]  Then they find other samples that other people had that they gave them.
[03:24:34.176 --> 03:24:35.437]  They destroy it immediately.
[03:24:35.437 --> 03:24:39.341]  You're saying crimes, obstruction of justice.
[03:24:39.341 --> 03:24:40.602]  Why are they covering it up?
[03:24:40.602 --> 03:24:43.445]  Well, then we have the White House on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic.
[03:24:44.105 --> 03:24:47.588]  Weeks before the anthrax letters show up, admitting that arrogantly.
[03:24:47.588 --> 03:24:49.971]  We have political enemies of the Bushes getting it.
[03:24:49.971 --> 03:24:52.893]  They use it as a smokescreen to pass the Patriot Act.
[03:24:52.893 --> 03:24:58.218]  They're pressuring the FBI, now public, ordering them to say Al-Qaeda, Al-Ciaida did it.
[03:24:58.218 --> 03:25:05.445]  I mean, this is the most open and shut case ever for the federal government, criminal elements of it, launching the anthrax attack.
[03:25:05.445 --> 03:25:07.828]  Then you have the cover-up, the patsies.
[03:25:07.828 --> 03:25:08.989]  I mean, break that down for us.
[03:25:10.438 --> 03:25:11.799]  Yeah, I think it's all clear.
[03:25:11.799 --> 03:25:39.538]  On the first weekend in November I went out to Harvard where I was running a workshop on biological weapons and I publicly stated at the time that in my opinion, my professional opinion, it was either elements of the United States government itself or contractors working for the United States government that was behind the anthrax attack and my
[03:25:40.037 --> 03:25:56.621]  Colleague at the time, Professor Jonathan King of MIT, who runs their, who's a microbiologist and runs their electron microscope lab, independently said the exact same thing I did.
[03:25:56.621 --> 03:26:06.143]  And I gave interviews on Fox and the BBC and Pacifica saying this, you know, the first week in November
[03:26:07.635 --> 03:26:28.408]  So it's been very clear, and the reason is that for the FBI cover-up, it would lead back to a secret, covert, illegal, and criminal offensive biological weapons program involving anthrax.
[03:26:28.408 --> 03:26:33.711]  And I say it's criminal because I was the person who drafted the statute making it a crime.
[03:26:37.048 --> 03:26:46.112]  That's what's going on here, that's why all the lying and covering it up all along, and they're still doing it today.
[03:26:46.112 --> 03:26:57.096]  If you read the investigation, the press conference they heard earlier this week, by the FBI, it does not add up at all.
[03:26:57.096 --> 03:27:02.238]  If you read the article in today's New York Times, it doesn't add up indeed.
[03:27:02.238 --> 03:27:05.159]  It appears from today's New York Times
[03:27:05.925 --> 03:27:35.534]  The FBI, for example, then set the investigation up by scientists in such a way that no one knew exactly what they were doing, and could not communicate with anyone else, and only communicated with the FBI, and only looked at samples provided to them by the FBI, and had to take on good faith from the FBI what the samples were.
[03:27:36.235 --> 03:27:47.149]  So, you have the case where the FBI completely controlled, dominated the scientific investigation, including the timing.
[03:27:47.149 --> 03:27:52.777]  Well, Dr. Boyle, I want to go through that, and as best we can piece together who exactly did it and why they did it.
[03:27:53.277 --> 03:28:00.280]  But when the mainline public on the street at coffee shops are saying, can you believe the government launched the anthrax attack?
[03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:01.000]  They're in trouble.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:03.941]  I mean, the word's out the White House was on the drug that fights it.
[03:28:03.941 --> 03:28:05.382]  The word's out it went to their enemies.
[03:28:05.382 --> 03:28:08.123]  The word's out they set this last guy up.
[03:28:08.123 --> 03:28:10.423]  I mean, I think we have a crisis of confidence here.
[03:28:10.423 --> 03:28:14.165]  Do you think the FBI knows just how ridiculous they look right now?
[03:28:15.731 --> 03:28:21.674]  Well, Alex, I think the important issue to realize now is this.
[03:28:21.674 --> 03:28:44.086]  You know, the FBI's been lying and covering up on this at least since the time I called Bowman, but there is today in existence a stockpile of super weapons-grade anthrax that is under the control of the original perpetrators
[03:28:45.075 --> 03:28:48.937]  of the anthrax attacks of October 2001.
[03:28:48.937 --> 03:29:03.984]  And that stockpile can and will be used again when their masters decide that it would be politically convenient
[03:29:05.594 --> 03:29:09.380]  Alright, we're going to skip this break too.
[03:29:09.380 --> 03:29:11.243]  Hold on, I just want stations to know that.
[03:29:11.243 --> 03:29:13.106]  InfoWars.com listeners, we're going to continue.
[03:29:13.106 --> 03:29:14.889]  Everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes.
[03:29:14.889 --> 03:29:16.571]  Got to tune over to InfoWars.com.
[03:29:16.571 --> 03:29:18.714]  Here we go with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[03:29:20.307 --> 03:29:22.368]  Okay, Doc, I mean, that's the point I keep making.
[03:29:22.368 --> 03:29:32.472]  If they carried out the attacks and all the evidence, I mean, it's 100%, they did it, from motive to means to the evidence to the witnesses to the Cipro, all of it, it's ridiculous.
[03:29:32.472 --> 03:29:35.974]  A, what did they think they were doing, because they haven't gotten away with it.
[03:29:35.974 --> 03:29:37.995]  I mean, this is really getting them more than even 9-11.
[03:29:39.295 --> 03:29:46.060]  And then B, getting into what you just mentioned, yes, they're still in power, they're still going.
[03:29:46.060 --> 03:29:50.243]  They could aerosolize this and say Al-Qaeda did it and launch an attack on Iran.
[03:29:50.243 --> 03:29:51.784]  Please continue.
[03:29:51.784 --> 03:29:59.289]  Well, they could launch another attack on us, and including on Congress, the judiciary, the media.
[03:29:59.289 --> 03:30:02.791]  You know, the media is the force of the state.
[03:30:02.791 --> 03:30:05.033]  You think this was a beta test?
[03:30:05.033 --> 03:30:05.894]  Army?
[03:30:05.894 --> 03:30:07.675]  Do you think that this was a beta test, then?
[03:30:08.783 --> 03:30:09.823]  What do you mean by a beta test?
[03:30:09.823 --> 03:30:16.585]  The first anthrax attack was a beta test to see what the media would do, how Congress would respond.
[03:30:16.585 --> 03:30:29.189]  Well, I believe the first anthrax attack was designed to ram through the Patriot Act because Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy were holding it up.
[03:30:29.189 --> 03:30:34.011]  And once the anthrax occurred, the attacks occurred, it rammed right through.
[03:30:35.872 --> 03:30:49.663]  On the renewal of the USA Patriot Act, Senator Feingold was holding it up, and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, some white-powdered substance appeared at, I think, one of the Senate office buildings.
[03:30:49.663 --> 03:30:50.324]  Yeah, I remember that.
[03:30:50.324 --> 03:30:51.885]  There was an anthrax scare.
[03:30:52.501 --> 03:30:56.382]  And then, all of a sudden, the renewal of the Patriot Act went through.
[03:30:56.382 --> 03:30:57.623]  Now, that was not real answer.
[03:30:57.623 --> 03:31:00.684]  Well, I mean, this wasn't... It doesn't have to be real answer, actually, this time.
[03:31:00.684 --> 03:31:14.308]  It's a reminder... Before your question on the media, I think the culprits here wanted to send a message to the news media as well, that if you really cover this story, you risk your lives.
[03:31:15.560 --> 03:31:16.200]  No, that's it.
[03:31:16.200 --> 03:31:22.003]  And then the people that did a story on the Bush daughters falling down drunk in Austin, the editor gets the first letter.
[03:31:22.003 --> 03:31:26.265]  I mean, so this is a thinly-veiled threat to everyone.
[03:31:26.265 --> 03:31:35.128]  So I guess the perpetrators, that's why Congress goes along with the wars and goes along with all of it, because I've talked to people in Congress who privately are like, yeah, yeah, we know what happened.
[03:31:35.128 --> 03:31:40.291]  And I mean, do you agree that it's just an open mafia message that is what you're saying, and that Congress knows?
[03:31:40.291 --> 03:31:41.171]  I mean, they know who did it.
[03:31:43.113 --> 03:31:46.114]  I think, you know, people in Congress, I stay in touch with them.
[03:31:46.114 --> 03:31:47.554]  I've sent them my materials.
[03:31:47.554 --> 03:31:50.115]  You know, they're smart, intelligent people.
[03:31:50.115 --> 03:31:52.836]  I think they know who was responsible for this.
[03:31:52.836 --> 03:31:58.338]  I don't think they believe the cock and bull FBI explanation.
[03:31:58.338 --> 03:31:59.398]  But of course, they're afraid.
[03:31:59.398 --> 03:32:01.619]  Their lives are on the line.
[03:32:01.619 --> 03:32:08.981]  I think what we have to do now is insist on a full-scale congressional investigation.
[03:32:09.423 --> 03:32:14.745]  Not some type of presidential commission cover-up along the lines of the 9-11 report.
[03:32:14.745 --> 03:32:19.407]  But then the neocons will probably just mail 100 letters of anthrax.
[03:32:19.407 --> 03:32:21.668]  I guess the whole nation is kind of held hostage.
[03:32:21.668 --> 03:32:31.172]  We're going to come back to the full audience, recap that, and get into your idea, your plan to deal with this, and then cover any other evidence that backs up what you're saying with our guest.
[03:32:31.172 --> 03:32:34.553]  Here we go.
[03:32:34.553 --> 03:32:35.794]  Dr. Francis Boyle.
[03:32:37.435 --> 03:32:49.180]  One of the former top bioweapons experts for the federal government helped write some of the major bioweapons conventions internationally for the United States.
[03:32:49.180 --> 03:32:53.982]  Day one he tried to help with the investigation and found out who was really behind it.
[03:32:53.982 --> 03:32:59.185]  These are hardcore killers and they'll do anything to scare you into submission after their little
[03:33:00.612 --> 03:33:04.795]  Little event they pulled off on 9-11, they weren't done, they launched their anthrax attack.
[03:33:04.795 --> 03:33:16.203]  And they did their dark winter scenario a few years before that, congressionally funded drill of massive anthrax spraying in Texas, in Oklahoma, and martial law being declared.
[03:33:16.203 --> 03:33:20.947]  And you better believe, ladies and gentlemen, they got private contractors ready to spray it on your cities.
[03:33:21.667 --> 03:33:24.989]  And then they'll grab some guy with a beard and put him on TV and say he did it.
[03:33:24.989 --> 03:33:26.389]  It might even be a hologram.
[03:33:26.389 --> 03:33:30.612]  I mean, these guys are just... there's no end to what they'll do.
[03:33:30.612 --> 03:33:33.553]  And Dr. Boyle is our guest.
[03:33:33.553 --> 03:33:37.895]  During the last... you just started calling for a congressional investigation.
[03:33:37.895 --> 03:33:41.297]  The country's being held hostage by the real terrorist.
[03:33:41.297 --> 03:33:42.037]  You've got the floor.
[03:33:42.037 --> 03:33:45.959]  I'd like you to talk more about that and then go back into evidence because it's so voluminous.
[03:33:45.959 --> 03:33:47.220]  Anything else you'd like to talk about?
[03:33:48.959 --> 03:34:10.318]  Right, well, we need hearings along the lines of what we had in the Watergate hearings under President Nixon, where we have open public hearings by a joint committee of Congress, because this attack was designed to shut Congress down, which it did.
[03:34:10.318 --> 03:34:14.842]  It succeeded, to the best of my knowledge, for the first time in the history of our republic,
[03:34:15.501 --> 03:34:19.643]  Congress was actually shut down and rendered inoperative.
[03:34:19.643 --> 03:34:22.744]  The House went out of business.
[03:34:22.744 --> 03:34:28.586]  The Senate said it would stay in session, but with the House out of business, you can't do business.
[03:34:28.586 --> 03:34:34.889]  So this is a political crime of the first magnitude.
[03:34:34.889 --> 03:34:37.890]  The Supreme Court, as well, also shut down.
[03:34:37.890 --> 03:34:40.591]  And the media were attacked, our fourth estate.
[03:34:41.667 --> 03:34:46.631]  Of course, the presidency and the executive branch was not attacked.
[03:34:46.631 --> 03:34:52.896]  I leave that to you to figure it out, but we do know the White House was on Cipro.
[03:34:52.896 --> 03:35:04.165]  So, that's really what we need, and maybe if there are open public hearings by Congress, people put under oath with subpoena power, members of Congress then might feel
[03:35:04.873 --> 03:35:12.718]  Some protection from further threats by the people currently under control of the anthrax.
[03:35:12.718 --> 03:35:32.191]  You also have to tie into this the large numbers of dead microbiologists that have appeared since around the summer before these events, when the New York Times revealed the existence of the
[03:35:33.047 --> 03:35:39.312]  Uh, covert, uh, anthrax, uh, weapons programs run by the CIA and Battelle.
[03:35:39.312 --> 03:35:41.973]  And that, too, is in the public record.
[03:35:41.973 --> 03:35:44.035]  Yeah, those are... The list keeps going.
[03:35:44.035 --> 03:35:50.439]  Ivins is only, uh, only the, uh, latest dead microbiologist, so you are correct.
[03:35:50.439 --> 03:35:53.201]  Um, these culprits are playing for keeps.
[03:35:53.201 --> 03:35:56.744]  They are... They are prepared to, uh, to kill people.
[03:35:56.744 --> 03:35:58.305]  Uh, they've tried to kill people.
[03:35:58.305 --> 03:35:59.506]  I think they have killed people.
[03:36:00.148 --> 03:36:06.111]  Well, there's no doubt under PDD 51, the Continuative Government System has taken over the government.
[03:36:06.111 --> 03:36:16.556]  Congress knows they were hit by a biological attack from the executive branch and the shadow government, controlled by foreign agencies, foreign intelligence operations, British and Israeli, predominantly.
[03:36:16.556 --> 03:36:21.198]  And they have now bullied the media and the Congress into full submission.
[03:36:23.089 --> 03:36:25.591]  They are hopping mad at the Russians for not submitting.
[03:36:25.591 --> 03:36:28.092]  God knows what they'll pull on them now.
[03:36:28.092 --> 03:36:36.157]  And we are completely controlled by megalomaniacs who have limitless will, dark will, to do God knows what.
[03:36:36.157 --> 03:36:39.759]  Mr. Boyle, I mean, I can't imagine a more nightmare scenario.
[03:36:39.759 --> 03:36:43.782]  And it's so transparent because they want it to be transparent, don't they?
[03:36:45.987 --> 03:36:55.372]  Well, I think it's transparent for people who are really following what's going on and adding it up, but I don't think for the vast majority of the American people.
[03:36:55.372 --> 03:37:09.339]  I do think you are correct in your analysis that the Presidential Doctrine for Continuity of Government was put into effect on September 11th, and it's still in operation today.
[03:37:09.339 --> 03:37:12.701]  And that we do have, in fact, a secret government that
[03:37:13.223 --> 03:37:17.885]  You know, is really running things behind the scenes, probably.
[03:37:17.885 --> 03:37:20.065]  Cheney is in charge of it.
[03:37:20.065 --> 03:37:23.347]  And so there are really two governments out there.
[03:37:23.347 --> 03:37:25.947]  And that can account for a lot of anomalies.
[03:37:25.947 --> 03:37:34.050]  For example, what happened at the Minot Air Force Base with the nuclear cruise missiles.
[03:37:34.050 --> 03:37:40.973]  That decision to deploy those nuclear cruise missiles had to come directly from a chain of command.
[03:37:40.973 --> 03:37:42.013]  It was not a mistake.
[03:37:42.717 --> 03:37:48.962]  And with the continuity of government, then there are now two chains of command.
[03:37:48.962 --> 03:38:00.610]  So I think you can add up a lot of things by realizing that, you know, there's the open government and then there's the COG in operation.
[03:38:00.610 --> 03:38:00.951]  Right.
[03:38:00.951 --> 03:38:11.419]  Professor Boyle, a lot of people that don't understand history or the way subterfuge works, they wonder why you're alive, why I'm alive, why so many others are alive, if this is all true.
[03:38:12.620 --> 03:38:15.262]  And I would just say it's because they don't want to validate what we've said.
[03:38:15.262 --> 03:38:17.083]  They don't want to underline our words.
[03:38:17.083 --> 03:38:19.905]  They don't want to highlight what we've said and done.
[03:38:19.905 --> 03:38:22.427]  But I do feel the wings of death flapping about.
[03:38:22.427 --> 03:38:23.147]  I've been threatened.
[03:38:23.147 --> 03:38:25.069]  I've had all sorts of other stuff happen.
[03:38:25.069 --> 03:38:26.550]  A lot of other people have been killed.
[03:38:26.550 --> 03:38:28.971]  So it's not a joke to me, but I just think my lucky stars.
[03:38:28.971 --> 03:38:31.013]  Thank God every day I'm still here.
[03:38:33.215 --> 03:38:38.541]  What's your take on why other whistleblowers and other prominent people are still alive?
[03:38:38.541 --> 03:38:43.988]  If these guys are such murderers and such killers, why they haven't come after us?
[03:38:43.988 --> 03:38:45.770]  Well, Dr. Ivins is not alive.
[03:38:45.770 --> 03:38:51.277]  He joined the growing list of microbiologists who are now dead.
[03:38:52.152 --> 03:39:00.577]  I can't recall the last time I looked at that list, but it was somewhere in the area of 15 to 20 microbiologists have died.
[03:39:00.577 --> 03:39:02.259]  It's a lot more than that.
[03:39:02.259 --> 03:39:05.020]  Yeah, maybe 20 or something like that.
[03:39:05.020 --> 03:39:09.343]  If you look at it globally, it's like 20 in the U.S.
[03:39:09.343 --> 03:39:12.205]  being shot in the back of the head, being tortured to death, being drowned.
[03:39:12.205 --> 03:39:14.406]  It's hundreds worldwide.
[03:39:14.406 --> 03:39:14.566]  Right.
[03:39:18.443 --> 03:39:23.045]  I think disposing of people who don't directly know what's going on.
[03:39:23.045 --> 03:39:27.767]  I know, you know, Senator Wellstone disappeared too.
[03:39:27.767 --> 03:39:34.851]  So, you know, I take it the reason others are around is that they don't really care.
[03:39:34.851 --> 03:39:36.992]  They have all the levers of power.
[03:39:36.992 --> 03:39:41.814]  No, no, they're actually glad we're here saying they control the Congress and murder whoever they want.
[03:39:41.814 --> 03:39:42.914]  They enjoy it.
[03:39:42.914 --> 03:39:46.096]  And all the big gorillas that work in Army Intelligence think it's real funny.
[03:39:46.840 --> 03:39:48.081]  They love their cocaine money.
[03:39:48.081 --> 03:39:49.382]  They love their houses in Maui.
[03:39:49.382 --> 03:39:51.224]  They love butcher in this country.
[03:39:51.224 --> 03:39:51.784]  Wide open.
[03:39:51.784 --> 03:39:52.825]  Good job, guys.
[03:39:52.825 --> 03:39:55.087]  Please continue, Dr. Boyle.
[03:39:55.087 --> 03:39:59.530]  Well, I don't think they think we're very effective one way or the other.
[03:39:59.530 --> 03:40:01.572]  Otherwise, they would take us out, sure.
[03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:03.731]  Well, you know, it could be the twilight of
[03:40:26.485 --> 03:40:28.847]  The American Republic, I hate to say that.
[03:40:28.847 --> 03:40:40.640]  You know, I've been a lawyer since January 10, 1977, taking an oath to uphold the constitutional laws of the United States, as my father was before me.
[03:40:40.640 --> 03:40:45.605]  And it could be we're at the end of the line here for democracy in America.
[03:40:47.179 --> 03:40:53.183]  That's right, you're a top constitutional law scholar as well, we just can't cover all of your illustrious background.
[03:40:53.183 --> 03:40:58.708]  Let's go over more of the evidence, more areas with the curious case of Dr. Ivins.
[03:40:58.708 --> 03:41:02.651]  I mean, the media, you notice, it was so hard to find that he died in government custody.
[03:41:03.311 --> 03:41:03.571]  It is.
[03:41:03.571 --> 03:41:06.453]  I mean, if you just read any of the accounts, I mean, now surprisingly you even have
[03:41:26.165 --> 03:41:37.451]  People in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, experts, microbiologists, former biowarfare people saying they don't believe Ivins did it.
[03:41:37.451 --> 03:41:38.472]  That's correct.
[03:41:38.472 --> 03:41:42.474]  That's how flimsy the cover-up has become.
[03:41:42.474 --> 03:41:47.837]  Again, just read today's New York Times.
[03:41:47.837 --> 03:41:53.760]  The more facts come out, the harder it comes to explain any of these things.
[03:41:55.231 --> 03:42:07.441]  Why did they rush out and grab Ivins and killed him and then made the ridiculous story up about, oh, he's been our main suspect for four years, when just a year ago they were saying the only suspect was Hatfield?
[03:42:07.441 --> 03:42:14.326]  I mean, is that a total contempt for the public's memory, or what is that?
[03:42:14.326 --> 03:42:17.889]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:42:17.889 --> 03:42:20.451]  I don't know if Ivins was killed one way or the other.
[03:42:22.950 --> 03:42:35.793]  You know, they first blamed it on Hatfield, knowing he wasn't responsible, but that could stall and delay everything for a long time, and see if they could get Hatfield to crack up, and he didn't.
[03:42:35.793 --> 03:42:37.894]  He fought back.
[03:42:37.894 --> 03:42:49.217]  Ivins, so then they moved to him, and they got him to crack up, and either he was off by himself, or we still don't know the circumstances one way or the other.
[03:42:49.730 --> 03:42:56.517]  So now they have a dead man, and dead man tells no tales, so they just pin it on the dead man, the dead microbiologist.
[03:42:57.045 --> 03:42:57.645]  Yeah, it's easy.
[03:42:57.645 --> 03:43:00.106]  They have a dead defendant.
[03:43:00.106 --> 03:43:06.609]  Talking about the FBI, they've always been hooked in with the Mafia since their conception during Prohibition being paid off.
[03:43:06.609 --> 03:43:15.433]  So from their zenith, or really birth I should say, from their genesis, they have been mobsters.
[03:43:15.433 --> 03:43:18.215]  Now, I mean, I've seen the FBI out on the streets and places.
[03:43:18.215 --> 03:43:19.975]  They're really scary people.
[03:43:19.975 --> 03:43:25.718]  I mean, do you think the average FBI agent really understands they're working for basically a Gestapo organization?
[03:43:26.636 --> 03:43:42.100]  Well, actually, a Mr. Swearegan, who had been an FBI agent and retired and was decorated, wrote a book on the FBI and called it the American Gestapo, repeatedly.
[03:43:42.100 --> 03:43:44.141]  He was a veteran FBI agent.
[03:43:44.141 --> 03:43:45.881]  I think that is correct.
[03:43:45.881 --> 03:43:48.682]  The last time we discussed the matter,
[03:43:49.820 --> 03:44:15.929]  I think I told you that two FBI agents, well, one agent for the FBI and another for the FBI-CIA Joint Terrorism Task Force, showed up at my office, interrogated me for an hour, tried to get me to become an informant on my Arab and Muslim clients, which would have violated their constitutional rights and my ethical obligations as an attorney.
[03:44:16.459 --> 03:44:36.330]  Of course I refused to become an informant for the FBI, but I did tell them that I was trying to cooperate with the FBI on the anthrax investigation, and told them of my phone calls there to Mr. Bowman to try to do something on the anthrax investigation.
[03:44:36.330 --> 03:44:44.175]  And then the FBI-CIA went out and put me on all the United States government's terrorist watch lists.
[03:44:44.713 --> 03:44:45.554]  Every one of them.
[03:44:45.554 --> 03:44:50.800]  My lawyer says there are five or six of them, and as far as he could figure out, I'm on all of them.
[03:44:50.800 --> 03:45:02.735]  So, that gives you a pretty good idea of what's going on here, that one guy trying to help unravel the anthrax investigation gets put on the terrorist watch list.
[03:45:04.045 --> 03:45:10.269]  Well, you know, I know it's all about power and who wins, but there's no doubt that I'm trying to defend this country, what's left of it.
[03:45:10.269 --> 03:45:11.970]  So are you.
[03:45:11.970 --> 03:45:18.854]  And, you know, guys, we don't expect you to quit the FBI or even stand up for the country, but at least you can passively not join the evil.
[03:45:18.854 --> 03:45:21.856]  I mean, is it that much fun to destroy America?
[03:45:21.856 --> 03:45:24.117]  I mean, I don't understand the enjoyment.
[03:45:24.117 --> 03:45:26.338]  Where do they find these people?
[03:45:26.338 --> 03:45:32.442]  Well, we have to remember there were some good, solid FBI people there up in Minneapolis
[03:45:33.078 --> 03:45:37.041]  Trying to get that, uh, warrant into... But notice they're always off in a field office.
[03:45:37.041 --> 03:45:38.602]  I understand it's compartmentalized.
[03:45:38.602 --> 03:45:38.982]  Yeah.
[03:45:38.982 --> 03:45:39.602]  Right.
[03:45:39.602 --> 03:45:49.448]  But they tried... Those in the field, Crowley and the rest of them, tried very hard to get that, uh, warrant into Moussaoui's computer that very well could have unraveled, uh, 9-11.
[03:45:51.019 --> 03:45:58.543]  And that was killed by Marion Spike Bowman, who was the same guy I was dealing with in good faith.
[03:45:58.543 --> 03:46:11.170]  And then, by the way, the FBI agents that blocked the anthrax in the 9-11 investigation, even before, they all got record cash bonuses, and those that tried to stop the attacks, they got demoted.
[03:46:11.170 --> 03:46:12.411]  Right.
[03:46:12.411 --> 03:46:19.095]  The people who were in charge of the cover-ups on both 9-11 and the anthrax have all been promoted, which
[03:46:19.719 --> 03:46:32.132]  Indicates they've done what their masters wanted them to do and I think the reason why, you know, eventually if we can unravel who is behind
[03:46:32.816 --> 03:46:36.539]  The anthrax attacks, we're going to find out who really was behind 9-11.
[03:46:36.539 --> 03:46:44.564]  Well, I know you have a lot of... And that's why they're so, you know, they're so desperate to cover everything up and lie about it.
[03:46:44.564 --> 03:46:54.151]  I know you have a lot of gravitas, sir, so you like to be very careful what you say, but do you think a person of interest needs to be looked at as this Philip Zach person, or is he another Red Herring?
[03:46:54.151 --> 03:47:01.456]  I really don't know much about Mr. Zach, just what I've read in the public record, but certainly at the top of everyone's list,
[03:47:02.570 --> 03:47:12.998]  Should be Mr. Patrick, who did this type of work for the CIA, and Ken Albeck, who did this type of work for the Soviet Union.
[03:47:12.998 --> 03:47:19.884]  Indeed, Albeck has made statements in the public that are inconsistent and simply not true.
[03:47:19.884 --> 03:47:27.049]  Albeck was brought over here by the CIA, so he's on their payroll, and Patrick was on the payroll.
[03:47:27.049 --> 03:47:27.730]  So I would
[03:47:28.208 --> 03:47:31.309]  You know, certainly identify them as the top of the list.
[03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.869]  That's right.
[03:47:31.869 --> 03:47:39.612]  Aloubek wrote about and was over an accidental release, remember, in the Soviet Union on that... Sverdlovsk.
[03:47:39.612 --> 03:47:42.413]  Yeah, was it the Kamchatka Peninsula?
[03:47:42.413 --> 03:47:42.754]  Right.
[03:47:42.754 --> 03:47:47.115]  Well, no, Sverdlovsk, which is in central Russia.
[03:47:47.115 --> 03:47:52.457]  But you have to understand that it's just not Fort Detrick here that could have done this.
[03:47:52.457 --> 03:47:54.018]  The culture
[03:47:54.913 --> 03:48:14.346]  From what I can see, it came from Fort Detrick, but again, assuming any of this information coming out is correct, 25% of it came from Fort Detrick, and 75% of it came from the Dugway Proving Ground, run by the Army, and with the CIA and Battelle working there.
[03:48:14.346 --> 03:48:22.872]  So, my guess is that the culture itself came from Fort Detrick, and then it was shipped
[03:48:23.326 --> 03:48:23.926]  All right.
[03:48:44.253 --> 03:48:47.854]  And then the electrostatic charges.
[03:48:47.854 --> 03:48:49.755]  How ridiculous is it?
[03:48:49.755 --> 03:48:52.695]  I believe it was weaponized at Dugway.
[03:48:52.695 --> 03:48:58.937]  I don't believe it was weaponized at Fort Detrick per se.
[03:48:58.937 --> 03:49:01.158]  How ridiculous is it?
[03:49:01.158 --> 03:49:05.279]  So we have a team of people here working on this.
[03:49:05.279 --> 03:49:10.160]  It's not simply a question of one or two or three people.
[03:49:11.343 --> 03:49:21.705]  And that's why we have all these big top bioweapons scientists saying, you're claiming that that Ivins was able to make this in his basement?
[03:49:21.705 --> 03:49:24.126]  That he was able to get something and then weaponize it?
[03:49:24.126 --> 03:49:28.366]  You know, they're saying that's ridiculous because they know what it takes, don't they?
[03:49:28.366 --> 03:49:29.967]  Sure, it's completely preposterous.
[03:49:29.967 --> 03:49:35.008]  Even Mr. Spurzel used to head up Fort Detrick and say it can't be done.
[03:49:35.008 --> 03:49:40.889]  So, and you know, I think both of these scientists involved in the investigation
[03:49:42.263 --> 03:49:48.288]  Like me, probably assume the FBI was dealing with them in good faith, but that simply isn't the case.
[03:49:48.288 --> 03:49:50.350]  Has this changed your view of the world?
[03:49:50.350 --> 03:49:55.835]  You know, working on this case, seeing this, and seeing how the federal government's been behaving?
[03:49:55.835 --> 03:49:56.595]  No, not really.
[03:49:56.595 --> 03:49:58.977]  You know, I'm 58 years old.
[03:49:58.977 --> 03:50:08.786]  I've seen, you know, going back to the Kennedy assassination, the two Kennedy assassinations, and the King assassination.
[03:50:09.591 --> 03:50:11.673]  This doesn't surprise me at all.
[03:50:11.673 --> 03:50:19.101]  I was just saying because you said that you thought the FBI would do something but I guess you weren't thinking they were involved.
[03:50:19.101 --> 03:50:21.443]  We're going to skip this break too with our guest.
[03:50:21.443 --> 03:50:23.105]  We'll be back in the final segment.
[03:50:23.105 --> 03:50:26.669]  The only place to listen to the behind the scenes is the InfoWars.com stream.
[03:50:26.669 --> 03:50:29.371]  You've got to go over to the site and click on that stream, folks.
[03:50:30.975 --> 03:50:43.843]  Okay, Dr. Boyle, this has been an amazing interview, and I just want you, in the next 6-7 minutes or so, to cover any other key points, any other areas, any websites you want to plug, you've got the floor.
[03:50:43.843 --> 03:50:59.113]  Well, I have a book on the subject called Biowarfare and Terrorism, Clarity Press, which you can read that sets out the case and the basic points that I'm making here today, and everything I'm saying in there.
[03:51:00.314 --> 03:51:06.017]  Uh, is, uh, has been confirmed, uh, by the latest revelations.
[03:51:06.017 --> 03:51:17.943]  Uh, in addition, um, since that book went to press, I have reviewed the, uh, uh, Pentagon's report to Congress on their, uh, chemical and biological warfare programs.
[03:51:17.943 --> 03:51:28.828]  And it's very clear they are engaged in the, uh, uh, development and use of anthrax, uh, as a, uh, uh, weapon warfare.
[03:51:29.891 --> 03:51:52.429]  It is also clear, if you read through there, the Pentagon, in this biowarfare program, is now testing, open-air testing, which is something that Congress passed a statute to prohibit, and yet there was put in there a presidential waiver.
[03:51:52.429 --> 03:51:55.131]  So we have to understand the
[03:51:56.018 --> 03:52:15.325]  The stockpile of this super-weapons-grade anthrax is still there, probably at Dugway, or perhaps Battelle in Ohio, and waiting to be used again when the Pentagon and the CIA decide they want to terrorize the American people.
[03:52:15.325 --> 03:52:21.127]  Cheney has said if there's another terrorist attack, he'll claim it on Iran.
[03:52:21.127 --> 03:52:22.588]  There's an election coming up.
[03:52:23.517 --> 03:52:51.174]  uh... that you know they're going to want to win for mccain who's um... in the pocket of all the uh... neoconservatives currently running the government in the continuity of government so there are a variety of uh... occasions coming up for these people to use this uh... anthrax and and panic uh... the american people either towards war towards a police state or towards uh... electing the uh... presidential candidate they want
[03:52:53.377 --> 03:52:55.819]  Amazing, absolutely amazing.
[03:52:55.819 --> 03:53:03.404]  We've got a few stations that are about to join us when we come back out of this segment, so we're going to plug the book again.
[03:53:03.404 --> 03:53:07.027]  I want everybody out there to get it, because this is life and death.
[03:53:07.027 --> 03:53:15.933]  I mean, it is a military culture to sacrifice pawns, and they have just gotten way too fast and loose.
[03:53:15.933 --> 03:53:17.935]  It's not enough to kill a million two Iraqis.
[03:53:17.935 --> 03:53:20.597]  It's not enough to bomb Serbia into the Stone Age with DU.
[03:53:21.607 --> 03:53:26.469]  You know, they see us as absolute cattle folks and this sick culture has got to be stopped.
[03:53:26.469 --> 03:53:33.871]  We're coming back live right now.
[03:53:33.871 --> 03:53:42.354]  Dr. Francis Boyle has a book out on the anthrax attacks, a scholarly detailed book that everyone needs to get and get out to their friends and family.
[03:53:42.354 --> 03:53:43.854]  This is Life and Death.
[03:53:43.854 --> 03:53:50.957]  If we don't expose these people, they're going to use terror attacks to completely overthrow the country and have a continuity of government system that even dominates Congress.
[03:53:52.287 --> 03:53:56.509]  Hell, Bush has even taken authority away from Homeland Security to himself.
[03:53:56.509 --> 03:53:59.950]  It's unprecedented, dark times, and I don't take pleasure fighting these people.
[03:53:59.950 --> 03:54:00.310]  I know.
[03:54:00.310 --> 03:54:01.851]  I mean, it is.
[03:54:01.851 --> 03:54:02.871]  I don't even have fear.
[03:54:02.871 --> 03:54:05.212]  I just know, man, this is serious.
[03:54:05.212 --> 03:54:07.853]  I don't like messing with these people, but I have to.
[03:54:07.853 --> 03:54:09.574]  You can't give in to them.
[03:54:09.574 --> 03:54:12.175]  And Dr. Boyle, we just commend you.
[03:54:12.175 --> 03:54:18.257]  The old 5,000-year-old system of sacrificing pawns, going back to being invented in India,
[03:54:19.668 --> 03:54:30.992]  Generals will sacrifice 1,000, 10,000, 20,000 troops to draw an enemy in over a ridge, thinking it's a larger force to then have their army behind the hill crush them, knowing it's going to kill their own force.
[03:54:30.992 --> 03:54:45.296]  In archery training, it's not just in the movie Braveheart, but it's historical cases of where different armies in Japan, in Europe proper, in Africa, the Egyptians would fire on their own troops to kill some of the other troops.
[03:54:45.296 --> 03:54:46.397]  That's an idea.
[03:54:46.397 --> 03:54:47.197]  Collateral damage.
[03:54:48.161 --> 03:54:54.363]  And it's nothing to the war planners running our country for the big banks to mail out some anthrax and kill some people.
[03:54:54.363 --> 03:54:56.524]  It's nothing for them to kill kids now.
[03:54:56.524 --> 03:54:59.184]  To kill a million two Iraqis, as I said.
[03:54:59.184 --> 03:55:04.126]  And we better realize that what's done to the Iraqis will be done to us.
[03:55:04.126 --> 03:55:05.386]  You reap what you sow.
[03:55:05.386 --> 03:55:08.247]  Dr. Boyle, can you speak to that idea and then plug your book?
[03:55:09.943 --> 03:55:11.523]  Well, sure.
[03:55:11.523 --> 03:55:16.565]  I went to the University of Chicago with all these neoconservatives.
[03:55:16.565 --> 03:55:22.727]  Wolfowitz was there, Chalabi, Kowalski, all the rest of them.
[03:55:22.727 --> 03:55:30.389]  They were getting their PhDs, and I was getting my undergraduate degree, later got my PhD from Harvard.
[03:55:30.389 --> 03:55:34.510]  I went through the exact same program that produced all these neocons.
[03:55:35.103 --> 03:55:59.095]  The political science department, Leo Strauss, the godfather of neocons, his mentor and sponsor in Germany was Professor Carl Schmitt, who went on to become the most notorious Nazi law professor of that benighted era, and justified every hideous atrocity
[03:55:59.710 --> 03:56:03.331]  The Nazis inflicted on anyone, including the Jews.
[03:56:03.331 --> 03:56:13.133]  And now his grandchildren are Alberto Gonzalez, the current Attorney General, Mukasey, and John Yoo.
[03:56:13.133 --> 03:56:13.933]  That's correct.
[03:56:13.933 --> 03:56:19.895]  We have to understand, Alex, that they tried to train me to become one of these people.
[03:56:19.895 --> 03:56:21.535]  Don't you have a special Ph.D.?
[03:56:21.535 --> 03:56:24.176]  They only give one a year from Harvard.
[03:56:24.176 --> 03:56:26.156]  Don't you have the Kissinger Ph.D.?
[03:56:26.156 --> 03:56:28.837]  Yeah, I went to the same program that Kissinger did.
[03:56:30.069 --> 03:56:34.653]  At the Center for International Affairs, they gave me Kissinger's old office.
[03:56:34.653 --> 03:56:37.515]  His file cabinets were sitting there when I moved in.
[03:56:37.515 --> 03:56:45.881]  But the point is, we have to understand these neo-conservatives, then, are in fact neo-Nazis.
[03:56:45.881 --> 03:56:53.466]  And this is a neo-Nazi mentality that has taken over our government.
[03:56:53.466 --> 03:56:58.210]  And these are the people making these decisions
[03:56:58.853 --> 03:57:00.612]  And that then gets back to why...
[03:57:01.249 --> 03:57:06.393]  They have no problem unleashing an anthrax attack on the American people in Congress.
[03:57:06.393 --> 03:57:08.535]  Indeed, they're anti-democratic.
[03:57:08.535 --> 03:57:27.530]  Professor Boyle, I can go into overdrive on this radio show, but I don't want to keep you, the show's over in one minute, but I want to extend the show for ten minutes, commercial free, just for the internet streams, but that's hundreds of thousands listening on the internet and tens of thousands later spread out on video.
[03:57:27.530 --> 03:57:30.653]  Can you do ten more minutes right now just so you can finish this statement?
[03:57:31.493 --> 03:57:31.993]  Sure.
[03:57:31.993 --> 03:57:33.454]  Okay, we're going to go into overdrive.
[03:57:33.454 --> 03:57:36.015]  I want to thank the Genesis Network and all the affiliates.
[03:57:36.015 --> 03:57:51.924]  If you go to InfoWars.com, only on those audio streams, and PrisonPlanet.tv on the video, we're going to continue with an addendum, not just the anthrax attacks, but who they are, the mindset that allows them to engage in this type of behavior.
[03:57:51.924 --> 03:57:53.885]  And so, again, you need to go to one place
[03:57:54.605 --> 03:57:55.965]  Do you want to talk to the guest?
[03:58:14.057 --> 03:58:24.063]  Uh, no, I'm gonna say bye to you, and I am just going to, uh, uh, uh, well, I need to go ahead and... ...them, uh, to engage in this type of behavior.
[03:58:24.063 --> 03:58:31.948]  And so, uh, again, you need to go to one place, InfoWars.com, to click on those streams right now, uh, with Dr. Boyle.
[03:58:31.948 --> 03:58:36.571]  Don't forget my new film, Fabled Enemies, uh, that I produced, that Jason Burmiss has directed.
[03:58:36.571 --> 03:58:39.973]  You can pre-order it now, it comes out in ten days, InfoWars.com.
[03:58:40.828 --> 03:58:42.011]  Go ahead.
[03:58:42.011 --> 03:58:44.456]  Dr. Boyle, we're going to call you back in one minute.
[03:58:52.438 --> 03:58:59.183]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:58:59.183 --> 03:59:01.725]  The enemy's here in the next few minutes.
[03:59:01.725 --> 03:59:02.426]  Thank you, John.
[03:59:02.426 --> 03:59:03.767]  You can go ahead and disconnect.
[03:59:03.767 --> 03:59:04.688]  All right, take care.
[03:59:04.688 --> 03:59:11.293]  Yeah, I decided in the last minute to go to extra transmission, so things are a bit bumpy here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:59:11.293 --> 03:59:13.214]  Not too bumpy, they're just real.
[03:59:13.214 --> 03:59:16.297]  Because I didn't want to cut him off with what he was saying, and that's the great luxury
[03:59:16.897 --> 03:59:20.579]  I mean, are we talking to 2 million people right now on the AM and FM 60-plus affiliates?
[03:59:20.579 --> 03:59:21.139]  No.
[03:59:21.139 --> 03:59:23.221]  Are we on the global shortwave and satellite?
[03:59:23.221 --> 03:59:24.281]  No.
[03:59:24.281 --> 03:59:35.267]  But we've got tens of thousands listening on the internet, on the streams, and a lot of people watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, and this will be magnified on the web later when people post it on YouTube and all the other sites.
[03:59:35.267 --> 03:59:39.810]  I would also encourage listeners, there's a lot of other up-and-coming video sites.
[03:59:40.888 --> 03:59:43.510]  Like Justin.tv and a lot of others I've been seeing.
[03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:46.051]  Folks should take these clips and put those up there too.
[03:59:46.051 --> 03:59:48.053]  Not just YouTube.
[03:59:48.053 --> 03:59:50.955]  Because YouTube is starting to censor a lot more.
[03:59:50.955 --> 03:59:56.198]  Though it's the biggest community and it's where you can reach more people and have more viral videos.
[03:59:56.198 --> 03:59:58.599]  Post there and on MySpace videos too.
[03:59:58.599 --> 04:00:00.841]  But then also duplicate it if you have the time.
[04:00:00.841 --> 04:00:07.845]  Put some of these key clips on some of these other big up-and-coming video services that also have millions tuning into them and watching them.
[04:00:07.845 --> 04:00:09.907]  Not hundreds of millions or billions like YouTube.
[04:00:11.095 --> 04:00:14.938]  Hundreds of millions every day, every week, but billions total on YouTube.
[04:00:14.938 --> 04:00:21.443]  So that's still the key areas, but attack in that area and also get into all of the other areas of the web.
[04:00:21.443 --> 04:00:23.425]  We're ready to go to Dr. Boyle.
[04:00:23.425 --> 04:00:27.087]  Okay, Dr. Boyle, I'm only going to keep you for T-minus 10 minutes.
[04:00:27.087 --> 04:00:28.989]  You have the floor completely.
[04:00:28.989 --> 04:00:39.357]  Talk about your PhD with these guys, the mindsets being around them, this cold-blooded, divorced from reality, divorced from conscience, this might makes right, survival of the fittest,
[04:00:39.717 --> 04:00:48.020]  This Nazi-type or Malthusian amalgamation that we're facing right now.
[04:00:48.020 --> 04:00:48.240]  Right.
[04:00:48.240 --> 04:01:00.545]  Well, as I was saying, I was trained to be a neoconservative at the University of Chicago by Strauss's co-author and literary executor later, Joseph Cropsey.
[04:01:00.545 --> 04:01:03.726]  Strauss had just retired when I showed up there.
[04:01:03.726 --> 04:01:08.668]  But I went through the exact same program that produced all these neoconservatives.
[04:01:09.335 --> 04:01:21.086]  And there are two books on them if you're interested by Professor Shadia Drury, D-R-U-R-Y, Leo Strauss and the American Right, and The Political Ideas of Leo Strauss.
[04:01:21.086 --> 04:01:24.630]  Professor Drury teaches political philosophy up in Canada.
[04:01:25.342 --> 04:01:31.085]  And she, to the best of my knowledge, was never trained at the University of Chicago as I was.
[04:01:31.085 --> 04:01:34.908]  But I agree with everything Professor Drury says.
[04:01:34.908 --> 04:01:38.650]  These people are neo-Nazis.
[04:01:38.650 --> 04:01:40.111]  That comes directly from
[04:01:41.391 --> 04:01:44.894]  Strauss, who was trained by Schmitt, who was a Nazi.
[04:01:44.894 --> 04:01:51.679]  We still don't know why Schmitt was never prosecuted at Nuremberg or any of the subsequent proceedings.
[04:01:51.679 --> 04:01:56.203]  Influenced by Machiavelli, by Nietzsche, and Hobbes.
[04:01:56.203 --> 04:01:59.305]  Those are the main influences on the neoconservatives.
[04:01:59.305 --> 04:02:04.729]  And then from there I went to Harvard to get my PhD in, and certainly
[04:02:05.183 --> 04:02:09.125]  Don't send your children to the University of Chicago for any reason.
[04:02:09.125 --> 04:02:12.887]  They will simply brainwash them to become neoconservatives.
[04:02:12.887 --> 04:02:24.813]  And then I went to Harvard to get my PhD in political science in the same program that produced Kissinger, Brzezinski, Huntington, and all the rest of these people.
[04:02:24.813 --> 04:02:31.456]  So, again, more of the same type of Machiavellian, Hobbes thought.
[04:02:33.041 --> 04:02:40.866]  Although not as, you know, direct a connection to Schmidt as the University of Chicago was.
[04:02:40.866 --> 04:02:51.754]  So these people are very bright, completely ruthless, unprincipled, and motivated by a Nazi-type philosophy.
[04:02:51.754 --> 04:02:59.799]  There's no other word to describe it, in my opinion.
[04:02:59.799 --> 04:03:00.800]  Continue, sir.
[04:03:00.800 --> 04:03:02.001]  I'm sitting back listening to you.
[04:03:03.120 --> 04:03:14.004]  Well, you know, if you want to get a PhD in political science at Harvard, you have to know your Machiavelli backward, forward, upside down, and in your sleep, and by rote.
[04:03:14.004 --> 04:03:17.026]  So that should give you a pretty good idea.
[04:03:17.026 --> 04:03:22.468]  Kissinger, Machiavellian to the core, Brzezinski as well.
[04:03:23.169 --> 04:03:30.544]  As I said, people like Wolowitz, Chalabi, Khalilzad, Shulsky, and the neocons from Chicago.
[04:03:30.544 --> 04:03:34.613]  For that, you'd have to read Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Nietzsche as well.
[04:03:36.150 --> 04:03:55.240]  And so many of the neoconservatives today, both in the government, in academia, these news media pundits that get quoted, have all been trained in the same system.
[04:03:55.240 --> 04:03:57.521]  Alan Keyes, classmate of mine at
[04:03:58.605 --> 04:04:02.868]  Harvard, studied with Harvey Mansfield and Straussian.
[04:04:02.868 --> 04:04:04.549]  I could go on with a list of them.
[04:04:04.549 --> 04:04:08.272]  Fukuyama, another neoconservative.
[04:04:08.272 --> 04:04:19.260]  He wrote a review of Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism for the Sunday New York Times Book Review.
[04:04:19.260 --> 04:04:27.966]  They gave him the entire back page to do this on the 100th anniversary, and he analogized Weber to Carl Schmitt.
[04:04:28.709 --> 04:04:33.950]  And he didn't bother to mention anyone in this review that Schmitt was a Nazi.
[04:04:33.950 --> 04:04:51.555]  Indeed, it apparently did not matter to the New York Times that Fukuyama was referring to Schmitt, the Nazi, favorably, without identifying as a Nazi, because the Sunday New York Times book review editor was a neoconservative himself.
[04:04:51.555 --> 04:04:55.236]  And many of the people there at the New York Times, like Brooks,
[04:04:56.458 --> 04:05:25.405]  uh... were you don't want to program at the university of chicago well i think it's cool who are studied uh... on the new york times he studied with uh... harvey manfield uh... the scholarship neoconservative uh... at harvard so it's a very dangerous and infestuous uh... situation bush himself made a speech at the american uh... enterprise uh... institute where he bragged that he had hired
[04:05:26.253 --> 04:05:32.898]  I think it was somewhere between 20 and 25 Straussians in his administration.
[04:05:32.898 --> 04:05:39.883]  So all these people work in accordance with this neo-Nazi philosophy.
[04:05:39.883 --> 04:05:44.166]  So it doesn't surprise me that you would see the anthrax attack.
[04:05:44.719 --> 04:05:46.120]  Or anything else they're doing.
[04:05:46.120 --> 04:05:47.721]  They will stop at nothing.
[04:05:47.721 --> 04:05:52.364]  Well, they've said, we have power, we've got to maximize it, we've got to go for everything.
[04:05:52.364 --> 04:05:54.905]  And they totally control McCain.
[04:05:54.905 --> 04:05:57.307]  Barack Obama's controlled by a lot of the same people.
[04:05:57.307 --> 04:06:00.109]  Do you even see them giving up power?
[04:06:00.109 --> 04:06:01.890]  I don't think they want to, that's right.
[04:06:01.890 --> 04:06:06.893]  I think they want, you know, all the neoconservatives now are working for McCain.
[04:06:07.718 --> 04:06:15.106]  Uh, this Randy Shuneman, his top foreign affairs advisor, was the director of the Project for the New American Century.
[04:06:15.106 --> 04:06:19.190]  I'm sure your listeners know all about PNAC and what they're about.
[04:06:19.190 --> 04:06:23.355]  He was, just until recently, a lobbyist for Georgia.
[04:06:23.995 --> 04:06:28.878]  So they've all congregated around McCain.
[04:06:28.878 --> 04:06:30.318]  Let's briefly talk about that.
[04:06:30.318 --> 04:06:34.600]  Georgia, I mean, is that another manifestation of their arrogance?
[04:06:34.600 --> 04:06:38.382]  And why do we see so many Israelis picking up a Straussian view?
[04:06:38.382 --> 04:06:41.944]  I mean, they just believe in the philosophy of the Nazis.
[04:06:41.944 --> 04:06:46.406]  It's not even a racial thing, is it, per se, Aryan race?
[04:06:46.406 --> 04:06:49.868]  It's the system and the ideals of governing, correct?
[04:06:50.723 --> 04:06:53.425]  I think that's correct.
[04:06:53.425 --> 04:07:05.935]  There was collaboration between the earlier Zionists and the Nazi regime to try to get Jews into Palestine.
[04:07:05.935 --> 04:07:13.160]  Lonnie Brenner has a book on that if you want to read the correspondence itself.
[04:07:13.160 --> 04:07:17.784]  But in any event, yes, to get back to Georgia.
[04:07:18.790 --> 04:07:33.561]  Even today, the Financial Times, the Deputy Defense Minister of Georgia admitted that when they attacked South Ossetia, notice he's incriminating himself here in aggression.
[04:07:33.561 --> 04:07:37.183]  This is in today's Financial Times.
[04:07:37.183 --> 04:07:40.746]  He said, but he didn't believe Russia would respond.
[04:07:40.746 --> 04:07:45.289]  But he's admitting that yes, they unleashed the attack on South Ossetia.
[04:07:45.289 --> 04:07:46.130]  Oh, that's huge news!
[04:07:46.130 --> 04:07:46.910]  I wasn't aware of that.
[04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:47.871]  Give me the name of the story.
[04:07:48.734 --> 04:07:55.919]  It just came through Financial Times to Bill C. admits miscalculating Russian reaction.
[04:07:55.919 --> 04:08:01.943]  The Deputy Defense Minister admitted it, that they launched the attack on South Ossetia.
[04:08:01.943 --> 04:08:03.344]  Now we have to understand
[04:08:03.985 --> 04:08:08.346]  That attack would not have been launched without the approval of the Bush administration.
[04:08:08.346 --> 04:08:19.110]  Well, we also don't just have neocons in NATO, we have the defense minister being Israeli, not even Georgian, their foreign minister, and the fact that they thought Russia wouldn't respond to a deadly sneak attack.
[04:08:19.890 --> 04:08:22.091]  And then now they're moving more missile systems in.
[04:08:22.091 --> 04:08:26.612]  They've yesterday kicked the ambassadors to NATO of Russia out.
[04:08:26.612 --> 04:08:32.713]  They didn't even do that after World War II and then into the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[04:08:32.713 --> 04:08:36.454]  I mean this is getting to be unprecedented and they're saying Russia will pay.
[04:08:36.454 --> 04:08:43.056]  Cheney made statements about he called the Russian president up and said there will be a response to this and slammed the phone down.
[04:08:43.056 --> 04:08:44.356]  That was in the mainstream news.
[04:08:44.356 --> 04:08:47.277]  I mean it's scary when you get these type of nuts
[04:08:47.757 --> 04:09:06.252]  I know they're very smart and controlled psychopaths, but at the same time, and they've codified it into a political science to give it some type of intellectual cover, they believe, but when you've got Karl Rove walking around saying, we control reality to newspaper writers, and you will just report on the new reality we give you, I mean, we see this psychology.
[04:09:06.252 --> 04:09:09.094]  Do you believe they've gone into megalomania?
[04:09:09.094 --> 04:09:13.637]  Well, this is, you know, consistent with the, you know, these people are sociopaths.
[04:09:13.637 --> 04:09:15.699]  That, you know, that's a regular
[04:09:16.545 --> 04:09:23.389]  Um, uh, position, uh, you know, psychologists, psychiatrists, whatever, they, they function, uh, that way.
[04:09:23.389 --> 04:09:44.102]  Um, but yeah, it's part of the neoconservative, uh, strategy here, uh, to basically resume a Cold War with Russia, uh, as they had against the, uh, Soviet Union, uh, figuring that, you know, the best way to deal with them is to destroy them if they can't.
[04:09:44.102 --> 04:09:45.403]  So we've seen the, um,
[04:09:46.370 --> 04:10:02.721]  This promiscuous expansion of NATO right up to the border of Russia, despite the fact that when the Soviet Union collapsed, the Warsaw Pact collapsed, there was no reason at all for NATO to be around.
[04:10:02.721 --> 04:10:09.145]  Indeed, what happened was that the Bush senior administration, instead of dissolving NATO,
[04:10:09.807 --> 04:10:14.432]  The opening shot of this was the war against Serbia, the bombing campaign against Serbia.
[04:10:27.145 --> 04:10:32.429]  Was this to be another snack, you know, to give that military system something to do?
[04:10:32.429 --> 04:10:35.592]  And obviously they thought the Russians wouldn't do what they've now done.
[04:10:35.592 --> 04:10:37.553]  Is this a big defeat of the neocons?
[04:10:37.553 --> 04:10:44.599]  And do you think this will generate more anger by them to have an outgoing victory?
[04:10:44.599 --> 04:10:54.767]  Well, I think they knew how the Russians would respond because there were also reports of a large-scale Russian buildup in Russia right over the border.
[04:10:55.741 --> 04:10:59.864]  So they fooled the Georgians and gave them bad intelligence?
[04:10:59.864 --> 04:11:01.285]  Well, they ordered the Georgians in there.
[04:11:01.285 --> 04:11:06.709]  I mean, the Georgian army is a subsidiary of the Pentagon and the Israeli Ministry of Defense.
[04:11:06.709 --> 04:11:09.752]  We've armed, equipped, supplied, trained these people.
[04:11:09.752 --> 04:11:16.837]  So this is meant to be an opening shalvo in a new cold-slash-hot-brushfire war?
[04:11:16.837 --> 04:11:17.577]  I believe so.
[04:11:17.577 --> 04:11:20.400]  At least a new cold war as they see it.
[04:11:20.400 --> 04:11:24.362]  And then, immediately, they ran through the
[04:11:25.399 --> 04:11:28.722]  Missile agreement with Poland.
[04:11:28.722 --> 04:11:32.485]  All along they had said, oh well, this has nothing to do with Russia.
[04:11:32.485 --> 04:11:40.532]  But then they capitalized on the vilification of Russia to ram this thing through, and everyone's supporting it.
[04:11:40.532 --> 04:11:48.579]  So it's part of the neocon strategy to resume the Cold War with Russia, and if it risks getting hot, then so be it.
[04:11:49.372 --> 04:11:51.113]  Well, it doesn't look very good.
[04:11:51.113 --> 04:11:56.755]  I think they're going to go all out to get McCain elected and continue the neocon agenda for another four to eight years.
[04:12:12.859 --> 04:12:14.360]  I'm a political independent.
[04:12:14.360 --> 04:12:18.101]  I'm not here trying to endorse Obama one way or the other.
[04:12:18.101 --> 04:12:21.823]  Just tell you the situation as I see it.
[04:12:21.823 --> 04:12:33.508]  And if that means provoking this crisis with Russia, and notice McCain has already shot up in the polls, and has now come even if not ahead.
[04:12:33.508 --> 04:12:35.048]  We had his advisor a month ago.
[04:12:35.048 --> 04:12:39.870]  We had his advisor a month ago, McCain, saying a new war would help McCain or a new 9-11, and voila!
[04:12:41.738 --> 04:12:42.538]  That's correct.
[04:12:42.538 --> 04:12:52.442]  And remember, Karl Rove has already said on the 2002 campaign on the crisis against Iraq, you don't bring out a new product in August.
[04:12:52.442 --> 04:13:02.786]  Well, they did, but it's clear that all this is being orchestrated, in my opinion, very carefully with the McCain campaign.
[04:13:03.608 --> 04:13:03.728]  Why?
[04:13:33.797 --> 04:13:41.131]  And the Hoover Institute is a well-known haven for neoconservatives and right-wingers.
[04:13:41.131 --> 04:13:45.320]  So you even have the Russian policies of Obama.
[04:13:46.419 --> 04:13:50.042]  Being determined by one of these people, Brzezinski.
[04:13:50.042 --> 04:13:56.366]  Again, I went to the same PhD program at Harvard that produced Brzezinski.
[04:13:56.366 --> 04:14:01.590]  You know, he's made highly belligerent statements and compared Putin to Hitler.
[04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:08.355]  Yeah, and we've got Brzezinski advising Obama and Brzezinski advising McCain.
[04:14:08.355 --> 04:14:14.599]  Well, again, we have problems also in the Obama camp as well.
[04:14:14.599 --> 04:14:15.360]  There are some
[04:14:15.951 --> 04:14:22.893]  I guess you'd say people who are more liberal there, but the McCain campaign is fully neoconservative.
[04:14:22.893 --> 04:14:37.819]  We would simply see a continuation and indeed an intensification of the Bush policies that have been a disaster, both at home and abroad, in the McCain administration.
[04:14:37.819 --> 04:14:41.260]  His lawyers are giving him legal advice.
[04:14:41.903 --> 04:14:42.223]  Absolutely.
[04:14:42.223 --> 04:14:43.344]  I've got to have you back up.
[04:14:43.344 --> 04:14:46.447]  I'm going to let you go here in just a moment, but this is the final question.
[04:14:55.084 --> 04:15:04.192]  Looking at all of this, do you think things are going well for them, or going badly for this crop of New World Order managers?
[04:15:04.192 --> 04:15:16.283]  I mean, it seems to me a lot of people are waking up, a lot of people see what's happening, but then you have them making arrogant statements like it's a joke, saying the 21st century nations don't invade other nations, and then even smiling with smart-ass looks.
[04:15:16.283 --> 04:15:19.626]  I mean, is part of their philosophy rubbing it in and being over-the-top?
[04:15:21.127 --> 04:15:27.251]  Well, I think that we are seeing some desperation on the part of the neocons.
[04:15:27.251 --> 04:15:29.632]  I don't believe they're out of power or anything like that.
[04:15:29.632 --> 04:15:33.855]  There was some reshuffling, but they're still in power.
[04:15:33.855 --> 04:15:48.344]  But the fact that they are taking steps like the anthrax cover-up, like what they did in Georgia, running over there to Poland and, you know, getting all of Europe upset, in my mind,
[04:15:48.843 --> 04:16:01.059]  That seems to indicate they are somewhat desperate and concerned about their position, which I think does give the rest of the American people an opening to try to stop them.
[04:16:05.506 --> 04:16:17.330]  The huge police state, the gearing up, the federalizing local departments, the secret camps, all in the news now, the Democrats greedily voting for all those programs, you know, they want that power.
[04:16:17.330 --> 04:16:29.313]  I mean, the real buildup I see against us, when we're servile going along with it all, what is it they're planning that's so horrible that they're gearing up militarily with a huge buildup for domestic suppression?
[04:16:29.313 --> 04:16:32.294]  I mean, is it just implosion of the economy through their greed, or what?
[04:16:33.183 --> 04:16:36.744]  Well, I think that, and also World War III.
[04:16:36.744 --> 04:16:51.330]  I mean, Bush himself, as you know, Putin, last October, flew to Iran, met with Iranian leaders, and said he did not believe Iran was developing nuclear weapons.
[04:16:51.330 --> 04:16:58.473]  Whereupon, President Bush then called a press conference and publicly threatened World War III over Iran.
[04:16:58.473 --> 04:16:59.473]  I think the first time
[04:16:59.895 --> 04:17:05.082]  Certainly in my lifetime where anyone has threatened World War III president publicly.
[04:17:05.082 --> 04:17:12.071]  Now that threat was not directed at Iran because Iran isn't capable of engaging in a World War III.
[04:17:12.071 --> 04:17:14.033]  It was directed at Russia.
[04:17:14.033 --> 04:17:15.235]  We'll take Mohammed Karzai.
[04:17:15.235 --> 04:17:16.236]  They're in a press conference.
[04:17:18.599 --> 04:17:38.639]  And Bush is talking about how Iran is with Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, and of course Karzai knows how bad that plays to all the satellite TV networks, where everyone over there knows the Wahhabis are Sunni, not Iranian Shiites, and that Iran is against the original organic
[04:17:39.219 --> 04:17:40.660]  Al-Qaeda or Al-Qaeda.
[04:17:40.660 --> 04:17:45.222]  I mean, that was like saying that, you know, Martin Luther King is Adolf Hitler.
[04:17:45.222 --> 04:17:46.583]  It was just complete opposites.
[04:17:46.583 --> 04:17:49.704]  And he said, excuse me, Mr. President, no, Iran is helping us.
[04:17:49.704 --> 04:17:51.485]  And Bush just said, no, they're not!
[04:17:51.485 --> 04:17:53.106]  They're with Al-Qaeda.
[04:17:53.106 --> 04:18:00.129]  And then, even before the Senate, McCain, a few months ago, the senator said, you know, isn't it true that Iran's Al-Qaeda?
[04:18:00.129 --> 04:18:01.150]  And he said, yes, that's true.
[04:18:01.150 --> 04:18:04.591]  I mean, it's just, and they always smile when they do it.
[04:18:04.591 --> 04:18:05.432]  It's just such
[04:18:06.292 --> 04:18:12.300]  Such disregard, arrogance, hatred of the public, just wanton lying.
[04:18:12.300 --> 04:18:14.302]  I've studied a lot of history.
[04:18:14.302 --> 04:18:16.125]  I know you have more so.
[04:18:16.125 --> 04:18:20.190]  I've just never seen something this over-the-top and shoddy.
[04:18:20.190 --> 04:18:21.331]  Studying propagandists,
[04:18:22.232 --> 04:18:30.597]  And even Goebbels said, you know, the propaganda needs to be slick, it doesn't need to be too over-the-top sometimes, or then you get discredited.
[04:18:30.597 --> 04:18:37.241]  It seems like they're going with just a muddy-the-waters-to-the-point-of-people... I mean, there's got to be some method to the madness.
[04:18:37.241 --> 04:18:37.962]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[04:18:37.962 --> 04:18:48.008]  It's just the lies... Well, there is, and again, today it was just reported on the wire services that the Aircraft Carrier Task Force under the Reagan
[04:18:48.881 --> 04:18:55.223]  Uh, and it's all its support ships and some others are now moving into place into the Arabian Sea.
[04:18:55.223 --> 04:19:00.325]  Uh, they will be arriving there about the third week in October, which will be right before the election.
[04:19:00.325 --> 04:19:12.009]  So, it does seem to me that, um, there will or very well could be an attack upon Iran, uh, either before the election or, or after the election.
[04:19:12.009 --> 04:19:18.051]  Um, and that very well could, could set off a, a conflict, a direct conflict with
[04:19:18.536 --> 04:19:19.357]  We're good to go.
[04:19:37.165 --> 04:19:44.949]  And risk setting off World War III, which President Bush has publicly stated he is prepared to do with respect to Russia.
[04:19:44.949 --> 04:19:46.910]  God help us, these people are going for broke.
[04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:48.751]  Well, Dr. Boyle, thank you.
[04:19:48.751 --> 04:19:50.472]  Plug the book one more time.
[04:19:50.472 --> 04:19:59.677]  Well, they are going for broke, and we also have to understand then that Senator McCain has said that if there is a World War III, there will be a draft.
[04:19:59.677 --> 04:20:00.358]  Yes.
[04:20:00.358 --> 04:20:06.481]  So that, I think, is why we're also seeing the police state tactics, that they are going for broke,
[04:20:07.083 --> 04:20:21.988]  And if this does happen, you'll see massive resistance here in the United States of America, certainly to a draft and a collapsing economy, and they're fully prepared to set up their police state.
[04:20:21.988 --> 04:20:23.048]  Well, you said it.
[04:20:23.048 --> 04:20:24.589]  Tell us about the book one more time.
[04:20:24.589 --> 04:20:27.530]  Well, the book is Biowarfare and Terrorism.
[04:20:28.700 --> 04:20:30.381]  I didn't come on here to plug my book.
[04:20:30.381 --> 04:20:33.362]  I came on here to try to explain.
[04:20:33.362 --> 04:20:38.723]  If I see it, I think, you know, the best of my assessment of the situation, what's going on here.
[04:20:38.723 --> 04:20:41.724]  No, I know you didn't come on to plug your book, but we need to get your book out.
[04:20:41.724 --> 04:20:46.266]  People need to read it, and that's why I keep wanting you to plug it, because people need to read that.
[04:20:46.266 --> 04:20:53.068]  And I want to get you back up in the next few weeks, because you're such an expert on all this, and I totally agree with your analysis, sir, and we're just honored to have you.
[04:20:53.068 --> 04:20:54.248]  Thank you so much, Dr. Boyle.
[04:20:54.622 --> 04:21:04.426]  Well, thanks a lot for having me on, and lets everyone out there go out and act upon the information that they received in this show.
[04:21:04.426 --> 04:21:05.006]  Thank you, sir.
[04:21:05.006 --> 04:21:05.787]  We'll talk to you soon.
[04:21:05.787 --> 04:21:06.507]  All right, thanks.
[04:21:06.507 --> 04:21:06.887]  Bye.
[04:21:06.887 --> 04:21:07.647]  There he goes.
[04:21:07.647 --> 04:21:08.568]  Bring in Burmese police.
[04:21:10.765 --> 04:21:12.065]  So I want to say bye to Burmese.
[04:21:12.065 --> 04:21:12.745]  I'm about to leave.
[04:21:12.745 --> 04:21:19.667]  I've got a few radio interviews tomorrow and I've got to get ready and geared up to go to the DNC and cover that.
[04:21:19.667 --> 04:21:21.587]  You know, you do an interview like that, it just freaks you out.
[04:21:21.587 --> 04:21:25.248]  I mean, these people are just psychopathic, starting World War III.
[04:21:25.248 --> 04:21:26.948]  They're pure evil.
[04:21:26.948 --> 04:21:29.729]  And I know, they said at martial law, I'm on a hit list.
[04:21:29.729 --> 04:21:31.229]  And they're just bastards, man.
[04:21:31.229 --> 04:21:37.410]  I just, I can't believe we have psychopathic demons running things and the public's running around fornicating in the streets.
[04:21:38.953 --> 04:21:45.997]  Well, we got good people like Burmy, and he's going to be here in town tomorrow.
[04:21:45.997 --> 04:21:50.519]  You're doing the Sunday show, and you're doing the show next week when I'm in Denver with live call-ins and the rest of it.
[04:21:50.519 --> 04:21:56.702]  So Burmy, coming up tomorrow and next week, what do we have to look forward to from you?
[04:21:57.493 --> 04:21:59.134]  We've got Gage, I think, tomorrow.
[04:21:59.134 --> 04:22:00.874]  I think we have Ryan on Monday.
[04:22:00.874 --> 04:22:05.136]  We're also going to be really picking apart this new World Trade Center 7 NIST report.
[04:22:05.136 --> 04:22:12.419]  Obviously, all week at the DNC we're going to have updates from yourself, Luke Hradowski, and Jonathan from We Are Change Colorado.
[04:22:12.419 --> 04:22:19.581]  And, of course, I'm going to be playing more teasers and trailers of the new film, Fabled Enemies, before its release on September 1st.
[04:22:19.581 --> 04:22:24.443]  A little early for the PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers on August 31st, but I've got a lot to do!
[04:22:25.724 --> 04:22:32.016]  You know, and I just want to take this opportunity to thank you so much Alex for everything you've done for me and allowing me...
[04:22:32.970 --> 04:22:34.091]  Hey, Trey just came in.
[04:22:34.091 --> 04:22:34.671]  Let's bring Trey in.
[04:22:34.671 --> 04:22:36.292]  Do you want to get on camera, Trey?
[04:22:36.292 --> 04:22:37.793]  Benjamin Fulford tomorrow.
[04:22:37.793 --> 04:22:41.976]  That's right, Benjamin Fulford of X-Forbes magazine editor.
[04:22:41.976 --> 04:22:43.678]  He's the one that got that Rockefeller interview.
[04:22:43.678 --> 04:22:44.478]  That'll be crazy.
[04:22:44.478 --> 04:22:45.959]  Straight out of Japan.
[04:22:45.959 --> 04:22:46.780]  It should be interesting.
[04:22:46.780 --> 04:22:48.101]  I mean, I'm looking forward to it.
[04:22:48.101 --> 04:22:50.282]  I'm open to other people.
[04:22:50.282 --> 04:22:59.349]  But anyway, I want to just thank you for giving me the opportunity to come out here to make this other 9-11 film that a lot of people said that I didn't want to make or I was trying to cover up.
[04:22:59.989 --> 04:23:02.430]  So, you know, without you, I don't think Fabled Enemies could have been possible.
[04:23:02.430 --> 04:23:03.230]  Well, you've been with the Luce.
[04:23:03.230 --> 04:23:05.270]  The Luce change is only three years old, the original one.
[04:23:05.270 --> 04:23:06.531]  You've been involved with them two years.
[04:23:06.531 --> 04:23:07.171]  I mean, this is... Three.
[04:23:07.171 --> 04:23:07.551]  A little bit.
[04:23:07.551 --> 04:23:08.591]  Like, three this summer.
[04:23:08.591 --> 04:23:09.812]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:23:09.812 --> 04:23:11.952]  So, well, give me the proper time frame.
[04:23:11.952 --> 04:23:13.433]  I think it was three this summer.
[04:23:13.433 --> 04:23:15.053]  I met them in the summer of 05.
[04:23:15.053 --> 04:23:18.374]  So that's when I started to get involved, basically that week.
[04:23:18.374 --> 04:23:20.014]  And I've been on this roller coaster ever since.
[04:23:20.014 --> 04:23:23.775]  And I've been, you know, researching since 2002, about six months after the attack.
[04:23:23.775 --> 04:23:25.656]  You know, I just... First video you saw was Road to Tyranny, right?
[04:23:26.176 --> 04:23:28.378]  First video that really scared me, you bet.
[04:23:28.378 --> 04:23:43.830]  That was, you know, I'd been researching 9-11 for probably about six weeks to two months and I just wanted to know more and more and I come across this guy named Alex Jones and I find this 77 megabyte real media file, just totally choppy, audio's out of sync by like 20 seconds or whatever.
[04:23:43.830 --> 04:23:50.115]  And me and my roommate sat down and watched it and I didn't want to do anything more than to prove you wrong on just about anything and I wasn't able to do it.
[04:23:50.115 --> 04:23:55.339]  I was able to verify your information and it really led me on this path to find out all the other stuff you talked about.
[04:23:55.759 --> 04:23:57.640]  On an extermination list.
[04:23:57.640 --> 04:23:58.001]  Awesome.
[04:23:58.001 --> 04:24:07.487]  Well, I'm willing to have my name on that list because, you know, it's just like I say, if I'm not free and you're not free... No, I mean, we have murdering monster terrorists who put poison in vaccines that kill kids.
[04:24:07.487 --> 04:24:08.508]  I've had it, man!
[04:24:08.508 --> 04:24:09.829]  I've had it with you killing!
[04:24:09.829 --> 04:24:11.050]  I'm sick of you filth!
[04:24:11.050 --> 04:24:12.171]  We're going to bring you to justice.
[04:24:12.871 --> 04:24:14.534]  And Burmish, you're going to be sitting in this whole week.
[04:24:14.534 --> 04:24:22.626]  We're going to cut now into retransmission from today's show with all those huge guests that we had on.
[04:24:22.626 --> 04:24:26.011]  Great interview with Resistance Manifesto, Mark Dice.
[04:24:26.011 --> 04:24:27.593]  We had our InfoWars reporter,
[04:24:28.835 --> 04:24:34.279]  Shane Geiger, who got into the NIST deal and made a stink and got shut down.
[04:24:34.279 --> 04:24:35.920]  From Texas to Maryland, Alex.
[04:24:35.920 --> 04:24:38.201]  And they turned the lights off on him, so that's coming up.
[04:24:38.201 --> 04:24:45.506]  We're going to cut into rebroadcast where I was taking phone calls right now, and the Burmese will be back live tomorrow, 11 to 3, and then Sunday 4 to 6.
[04:24:45.506 --> 04:24:47.347]  He is a great guy and we appreciate him.
[04:24:47.347 --> 04:24:49.008]  Pre-order Fabled Enemies now.
[04:24:49.008 --> 04:24:51.310]  It's going to be shipping in 10 days, the new film.
[04:24:51.730 --> 04:24:53.712]  And don't forget it will be up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[04:24:53.712 --> 04:24:55.414]  Burmese deserves this film to be big.
[04:24:55.414 --> 04:24:59.779]  It's important and it covers the really dangerous subjects of 9-11.
[04:24:59.779 --> 04:25:00.760]  Thank you for coming in, Burmese.
[04:25:00.760 --> 04:25:01.060]  Thank you.
