[00:00:01.029 --> 00:00:22.637]  Shane Geiger, the InfoWars.com reporter that got his question asked at NIST in our big whitewash, is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[00:00:23.317 --> 00:00:25.038]  We've got Jason Burmas in studio with us.
[00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.679]  We're streaming live right now on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:32.786]  And we got Jason Burmas in studio with us.
[00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:34.248]  I'm going to miss Jason Burmas.
[00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:43.701]  He's been down here for, what, five plus months and we just really enjoy having him with us.
[00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:47.697]  And he's going to come back down and make another film with us next year.
[00:00:48.418 --> 00:00:59.407]  I've really gotten attached to having Burmy, he hates that nickname, everybody needs to start using it, here with us in town, but he'll be back with the InfoWars team.
[00:00:59.847 --> 00:01:02.029]  But we've got Mark Dice, who I want to have
[00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.931]  Again, on, talk about his book when I get back into town.
[00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:08.712]  But right now, I wanted to play some audio.
[00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:10.053]  The video is up on YouTube.
[00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:10.914]  We're going to get it posted.
[00:01:11.494 --> 00:01:12.655]  And they talk about me a bunch.
[00:01:12.675 --> 00:01:16.097]  They talk about his evil, saying he wants to investigate 9-11.
[00:01:16.437 --> 00:01:17.577]  He does backpedal.
[00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.799]  He does say, basically, that it points towards inside job.
[00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:21.560]  He was on my show.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.521]  So, drum course, he is backpedaling.
[00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:25.122]  It's all over the New York Times, you name it.
[00:01:26.822 --> 00:01:28.643]  They're really trying to attack him that way.
[00:01:28.663 --> 00:01:30.585]  So, let's go ahead and play about a minute of this.
[00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:31.005]  Here it is.
[00:01:32.065 --> 00:01:35.831]  Last week, the Obama campaign released a 40-page manifesto criticizing the book.
[00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:40.117]  Joining us now to respond to these attacks is Jerome Corsi.
[00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:42.241]  I would propose that you've attacked Obama.
[00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:43.162]  You started the attacks.
[00:01:43.843 --> 00:01:46.868]  Here is some of the stuff that Obama has talked about.
[00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:47.308]  Sure.
[00:01:47.348 --> 00:01:49.631]  And some of the things, we've already covered a lot of this in your book.
[00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:51.293]  We've gone through some of the crazy things you've said.
[00:01:51.554 --> 00:01:51.774]  Right.
[00:01:52.515 --> 00:01:53.076]  That's all past.
[00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:55.339]  But some of the things you've said, for example, about John McCain.
[00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:02.368]  You said, as John McCain assumes a GOP frontrunner mantle, his little nose association with donors like George Soros and Theresa Hines carry.
[00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:03.629]  We're not after him.
[00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.850]  You're talking about McCain.
[00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.330]  Yes, I am.
[00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.391]  I'm talking about something.
[00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:13.013]  You know, I've got a bunch of friends who are emailing me saying, is there any way that I can get Senator Obama to attack their book?
[00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:17.234]  But you also said John McCain's personal fortune traces back to organized crime in America.
[00:02:17.274 --> 00:02:18.514]  You've really gone after John McCain.
[00:02:18.554 --> 00:02:20.475]  Look, I'm not voting for John McCain.
[00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:22.215]  I've attacked George W. Bush.
[00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:24.276]  Look at my last book, The Late Great USA.
[00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:26.017]  It became a New York Times bestseller, too.
[00:02:26.617 --> 00:02:29.778]  And you know, Alan, I'm going to vote for Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party.
[00:02:30.138 --> 00:02:33.079]  I wrote this book that I think the most dangerous candidate running.
[00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.060]  So far left is Barack Obama.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.862]  The Obama people have also pointed out some of the other things you've done.
[00:02:38.882 --> 00:02:45.566]  For example, you had a project that you were planning for January to expose what you call the government's inedible explanations about 9-11 attacks.
[00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:47.627]  We should have researched more of that article.
[00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:48.548]  It never got published.
[00:02:48.688 --> 00:02:50.289]  Well, but you can, but they never publish it.
[00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.930]  We didn't publish it, Alan.
[00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.770]  We withdrew it.
[00:03:13.084 --> 00:03:14.145]  No, I withdrew the article.
[00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:20.549]  I published instead an article, which they didn't, the Obama camp didn't find, validating the findings of the article.
[00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.132]  But what you said on Alex Jones Show, which is on tape, defending that position.
[00:03:25.212 --> 00:03:27.273]  I withdrew it, it never got published.
[00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:29.695]  Alex was interviewing me in the middle of research.
[00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:35.559]  And by the way, Alan, that research would not have supported this whole crazy idea that the government caused 9-11.
[00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.241]  It might have said that there was some evidence yet to look at and some questions to raise.
[00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:43.145]  I've never published anything in support of Alex Jones Show.
[00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:44.587]  You're misinterpreting that.
[00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:47.610]  I said I was looking at the evidence, Alan, and we didn't publish it.
[00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:51.494]  Now I'm like Pastor Wright or something, but on Courtesy.
[00:03:56.798 --> 00:03:57.679]  And it goes on and on.
[00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.180]  We'll play more of it later if we have to.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.702]  We have an anthrax expert coming up with really bombshell info.
[00:04:03.423 --> 00:04:05.204]  I want to say bye to Mark Dice.
[00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:11.848]  We also have the reporter, Shane Geiger, InfoWars reporter, that really did a great job confronting the NIS report today.
[00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:13.289]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.210]  Stay with us.
[00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:18.793]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:20.554]  Alright, let's keep rolling.
[00:04:20.774 --> 00:04:23.096]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:04:23.136 --> 00:04:23.877]  Yeah, let's keep rolling.
[00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.318]  I want to talk to Dice.
[00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:27.962]  Let me talk to Mark right now.
[00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:29.123]  Thanks.
[00:04:31.184 --> 00:04:31.644]  Hey, Mark?
[00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:32.224]  Yeah?
[00:04:32.745 --> 00:04:38.808]  Now we're still on air right now at PrisonPlanet.tv, just to let you know we're back live with a full AM and FM audience in one minute.
[00:04:39.288 --> 00:04:43.511]  Yeah, let me just get you on, not next week because I'm out of town, but the week after.
[00:04:43.551 --> 00:04:46.372]  And I do want to carry the resistance manifesto.
[00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:48.613]  Your first one was great, but this one's even better.
[00:04:49.014 --> 00:04:51.795]  So I need to talk to you about that today, get that nailed down.
[00:04:51.815 --> 00:04:52.776]  But just go ahead and mail me.
[00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:58.258]  200 of these bad boys, and I just want to really thank you for all you've done.
[00:04:58.278 --> 00:05:03.861]  I want you to come back and, you know, briefly comment on the 9-11 situation with Bermas.
[00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:08.483]  Then I want to get this other reporter up, Shane Geiger, who got into the NIS folks.
[00:05:09.043 --> 00:05:16.347]  And then make sure, John, that Trey has called Professor Boyle to move him to about 15 after.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.780]  Okay.
[00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:19.503]  Alright, here we go folks.
[00:05:19.543 --> 00:05:21.325]  Total transparency behind the scenes.
[00:05:21.726 --> 00:05:26.933]  We're coming back live with Bernie, Mark Dice, and of course Shane Geiger.
[00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:27.814]  Stay with us.
[00:05:45.393 --> 00:05:47.654]  Get ready for Real Talk Radio.
[00:05:47.674 --> 00:05:50.515]  That's what this radio transmission has always been about.
[00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:53.897]  It's really the original name of this radio show.
[00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.058]  It's also been called the Final Edition.
[00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:59.239]  Yeah, when I would do the last live show at a local station.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.381]  Okay, we got Mark Dice with us, the resistance band Mephisto.
[00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.541]  We're gonna have him back on.
[00:06:03.581 --> 00:06:04.662]  Get it at markdice.com.
[00:06:06.462 --> 00:06:07.763]  I want to shift into 9-11.
[00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:14.247]  Burmess, what do you think of Mr. Corsi, and what do you think of Mark Dice and what we just heard with him?
[00:06:14.687 --> 00:06:15.648]  It's throwing me under the bus.
[00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:21.952]  Oh, he's definitely throwing you under the bus a wee bit, but also, you know, I think Combs is throwing you under the bus.
[00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:29.637]  He also was contacted by you, has been on the show, and, you know, he's the little Democratic cheerleader there, the little psy-op on that end of the spectrum.
[00:06:30.197 --> 00:06:36.804]  And he just loves to use you to discredit people when, in fact, Corsi a couple times just tried to say, look, I'm looking at the physicist's evidence.
[00:06:37.244 --> 00:06:41.229]  And, of course, he did have to backpedal and say, maybe there were some unanswered questions.
[00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:44.652]  But I'm saying that, you know, there's no way that the government helped cause 9-1-1.
[00:06:44.672 --> 00:06:50.318]  And, by the way, Corsi says his publisher will, quote, not let him come on the show when he's under contract.
[00:06:50.598 --> 00:06:53.880]  Well, I mean, you got snubbed on Geraldo the other day and other Fox News.
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.580]  Yeah, they drove me down there, had me sit there.
[00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:57.501]  That's why I've always refused to fly there.
[00:06:57.762 --> 00:07:01.163]  They're always trying to get me to fly to New York, like it's some Murdoch joke.
[00:07:01.563 --> 00:07:03.624]  And the last guy I sent up there, the plane almost crashed.
[00:07:03.644 --> 00:07:05.805]  It was like dropping 2,000 feet in thunderstorms.
[00:07:06.546 --> 00:07:07.526]  I'm sure that's a coincidence.
[00:07:07.546 --> 00:07:08.447]  Of course it is, yeah.
[00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:13.889]  You've probably got some New World Order person down there in the witch's hat and a thing like, ah, Xaramon!
[00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.990]  I'll get you, Jones!
[00:07:16.751 --> 00:07:17.631]  Anyways, it's crazy.
[00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:18.912]  Mark Dice, final comments.
[00:07:20.623 --> 00:07:35.036]  I want to announce, and I'll do this when I'm back on your show in a couple weeks, for, you know, 9-11, the anniversary's coming up here in about three weeks, and for those who can't make it to New York, or who can't go out to a local rally, or who just want to get involved but don't know what to do, I want to just announce Operation Phone Mob.
[00:07:35.136 --> 00:07:37.218]  So, I think on 9-11, it's a Thursday.
[00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:40.261]  Details will be posted at markdice.com.
[00:07:40.681 --> 00:07:41.982]  I'll email that out to everybody.
[00:07:42.142 --> 00:07:46.026]  I think that we need to get hundreds of people to call into the radio talk shows on that day.
[00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:50.103]  And let's get every single phone call to be one of us.
[00:07:50.723 --> 00:07:52.465]  Let's address the issues, let's use it as an opportunity.
[00:07:52.485 --> 00:07:53.686]  And what do you think of Corsi?
[00:07:53.727 --> 00:07:55.248]  I mean, this is becoming a big issue.
[00:07:55.789 --> 00:08:04.337]  You know, there was some cross-talk there between him and Combs, but he said, I don't know if people made it out, but he said he's never written anything in support of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:10.226]  He's in a rough position, but again, he's got a lot of responsibility.
[00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:11.127]  He probably knows the truth.
[00:08:11.147 --> 00:08:21.819]  Yeah, he's the darling of the hardcore neocons, and then he's saying he's looking at Evans of Inside Job, and they're saying he's delusional about the North American Union.
[00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:22.699]  You know what it is?
[00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:34.863]  It's almost like when Ron Paul was initially interviewed by Student Scholars and he said he would support a new investigation, although he didn't believe that it would really tell the truth, and then he'd even have to backpedal from that position when he got bigger.
[00:08:35.163 --> 00:08:45.907]  Well, of course he was able to come on your show, talk about Thermite, but now that he's a New York Times number one bestseller and he's on all these shows, it's time to back off a bit, because 9-11 truth is just still too hot for some people.
[00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:47.567]  Oh yeah, they all know.
[00:08:47.607 --> 00:08:49.308]  They all know, every single one of them.
[00:08:49.935 --> 00:08:51.936]  His book's already a best-seller at this point.
[00:08:51.977 --> 00:08:53.197]  I think he has nothing to lose.
[00:08:53.257 --> 00:08:56.600]  He should just come out hard-hitting and just state the facts.
[00:08:57.341 --> 00:09:08.989]  You know, I understand that his publisher is trying to backpedal and protect their financial... I mean, he's always asking to come on the show because he knows my audience, with a few other shows, can push it up the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.792]  And I think his book's important, and you know, he's being attacked for saying it's disinfo.
[00:09:13.072 --> 00:09:15.594]  No, they're not attacking him on the book itself.
[00:09:15.914 --> 00:09:19.457]  They're attacking him on North American Union or 9-11.
[00:09:20.537 --> 00:09:22.299]  And so that's another issue.
[00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:26.662]  Why aren't they attacking him on the issues the book covers, Bernie?
[00:09:27.202 --> 00:09:34.231]  Well, I mean, they've got some minute errors in there and they blow them out of proportion for the book, but like you said, they don't want to address the main stuff.
[00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:41.159]  I mean, he does get in the SPP right after the discussion about you on Hannity and Combs, you know, Securities and Prosperities Partnership.
[00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:43.101]  So the guy's obviously very, very smart.
[00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:45.144]  He's very, very hip to what this movement's doing.
[00:09:45.744 --> 00:09:48.406]  I do hope he comes out a little stronger for 9-11 Truth.
[00:09:48.446 --> 00:09:49.187]  I don't expect it.
[00:09:50.028 --> 00:09:51.349]  His words can't be taken back.
[00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:54.771]  That interview with you is monumental and should be played all over the place.
[00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:56.352]  I mean, let's be honest.
[00:09:56.553 --> 00:09:59.475]  Without 9-11 Truth, we're never going to take this country back.
[00:09:59.495 --> 00:10:00.496]  They're going to keep staging more.
[00:10:00.536 --> 00:10:03.178]  Yeah, and he can vote for Chuck Baldwin all he wants.
[00:10:03.338 --> 00:10:04.359]  It's not going to help us.
[00:10:04.419 --> 00:10:06.380]  And Chuck Baldwin isn't admitted to 9-11 Truth.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.202]  He knows all about the New World Order.
[00:10:08.322 --> 00:10:10.423]  Oh, that's a nexus point.
[00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.324]  Yeah, of course.
[00:10:11.704 --> 00:10:12.465]  Let's just go ahead and do it.
[00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:16.466]  Dr. Corsi denies 9-11 Truth but supports 9-11 Truth candidate.
[00:10:16.886 --> 00:10:18.887]  Hey, Mark Dice, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:10:19.267 --> 00:10:19.687]  No problem.

[00:13:47.215 --> 00:13:50.176]  By the way, I'm on in Toronto tonight for an hour with Richard Serra.
[00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:51.876]  I'm going to plug that for listeners who want to hear that.

[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.061]  Ships out September 1st.
[00:14:06.481 --> 00:14:09.864]  Going to Shane Geiger, who I appreciate holding.
[00:14:10.305 --> 00:14:13.467]  Shane just popped by and said, can I say I'm an InfoWars freelance reporter?
[00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:14.088]  We said sure.
[00:14:14.608 --> 00:14:17.010]  They called and checked with NIST that he really was going.
[00:14:17.511 --> 00:14:18.572]  They had their little meeting.
[00:14:18.612 --> 00:14:20.854]  He got his question out and they shut him down.
[00:14:21.374 --> 00:14:29.221]  So just giving some background, Shane Geiger, tell listeners what happened, where this was, how you got the question in, and what happened.
[00:14:30.963 --> 00:14:32.844]  Hi Alex, thanks so much for having me on the show.
[00:14:33.084 --> 00:14:33.505]  Oh, thank you.
[00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:35.971]  Yeah, it's a pleasure.
[00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:42.077]  You know, I was basically making some statements that were backed up.
[00:14:42.137 --> 00:14:44.419]  I mean, this is fact.
[00:14:44.859 --> 00:14:57.350]  I was just stating what had been in the Twin Towers report, and then I stated some things about the back and forth between the Stephen Jones camp and this.
[00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.233]  Stephen Jones did a Data Quality Assurance Act request.
[00:15:01.104 --> 00:15:16.636]  And NIST replied back in September of 2007 stating that they are unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse, and they also stated that they did not conduct tests for explosive residue.
[00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:28.045]  Yeah, they won't do mathematic equations, they'll just show us video computer composites that any 14 year old with a case of Hot Pockets and Jolt Cola can make.
[00:15:29.286 --> 00:15:35.428]  Right, so this should sound very familiar to NIST because, you know, they were involved in this back and forth.
[00:15:35.748 --> 00:15:41.550]  And yet, this was at the point in my questioning where I was basically shut down.
[00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.211]  And I had a few other things I tried to get out after that.
[00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:52.233]  I'm very interested in the scientific method being applied to the research of all the 9-11
[00:15:54.013 --> 00:15:59.076]  Truthers, and you know, the other people who are looking... Well, describe where this was, how you were able to get this out.
[00:15:59.136 --> 00:16:00.776]  I mean, tell us the locale.
[00:16:01.076 --> 00:16:01.937]  Tell us what it was like.
[00:16:01.977 --> 00:16:03.498]  Tell us, you know, you were there.
[00:16:04.618 --> 00:16:09.961]  Yeah, we were in this 11-story nondescript building on the NIST campus.
[00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:13.182]  I'm glad it didn't collapse on us.
[00:16:13.202 --> 00:16:15.303]  It probably would have collapsed in about two or three seconds.
[00:16:15.484 --> 00:16:19.385]  Well, if somebody would have put a big lighter up against it, it would have been up to steel columns.
[00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:19.706]  Yeah.
[00:16:21.339 --> 00:16:23.780]  Yeah, well, it was just kind of surreal.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:34.105]  I was there among reporters from the AP, New York Times, Fox, the ZDF, which is the second station in Germany.
[00:16:34.765 --> 00:16:42.449]  I was actually talking after the event with somebody who's involved in the making of The Third Tower.
[00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:45.150]  So he's working with Mike Rudin of the BBC.
[00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:48.832]  So I got a lot of... It was really great to get some
[00:16:49.617 --> 00:16:50.478]  Media contacts.
[00:16:50.558 --> 00:16:51.758]  Thanks so much for that, Alex.
[00:16:52.739 --> 00:17:01.845]  And I was just, I was surrounded by all these people who, you know, obviously have an axe to grind.
[00:17:01.885 --> 00:17:08.389]  These people were sort of, you know, standoffish and it was not really a friendly environment.
[00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:17.195]  In fact, I think it was somewhat telling that as soon as they started, you know, calling NIST on these bear assertions,
[00:17:17.682 --> 00:17:27.630]  The lights actually went out in the room, so it felt a little unfriendly from that second on, and the microphone started moving away from me.
[00:17:29.892 --> 00:17:31.333]  This is just totally ridiculous.
[00:17:31.534 --> 00:17:39.180]  I travel halfway across the country to ask questions, and I have to show up under the pretext of being a reporter.
[00:17:39.835 --> 00:17:42.197]  When it's not enough to be a concerned U.S.
[00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:43.758]  citizen to show up here.
[00:17:43.778 --> 00:17:46.240]  Well, you are an InfoWars reporter and you did a great job.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.263]  Now, Burmess, you've been analyzing this, you've seen what happened.
[00:17:49.623 --> 00:17:51.885]  They're also backing away from their log, as we have the video.
[00:17:52.165 --> 00:17:57.169]  The front of the building has some windows knocked out, but they say in their report, a third of the building knocked out in the front.
[00:17:57.189 --> 00:17:58.330]  That's the South case, actually.
[00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:13.261]  Yeah, yeah, the south face of the building and we have the videos where there's a few windows blown out but we obviously see the guy walk into the building and then go up the escalator into the main lobby so there's not, well I believe what they said was a quarter of the building or somewhere between 10 and 12 stories scooped out of the building.
[00:18:13.281 --> 00:18:18.265]  Well their new model has no scoop out and they don't even claim... Oh, so the new lies for old!
[00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:24.550]  Yeah, yeah, there's no scoop out, they don't even mention the quote-unquote scoop out so they've retracted that statement.
[00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.952]  Now they're also saying it wasn't the fuel oil tanks
[00:18:27.412 --> 00:18:42.647]  And they're also saying, it's unbelievable with this, well they're saying that although no other building has even come close to this kind of structural damage, I guess, from hundreds of degrees less than known fires, that's what did it, was the thermal expansion of columns.
[00:18:43.228 --> 00:18:43.908]  We're good to go.
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:13.682]  Of course, the NIS guys all happen to be top experts in explosive thermate, when no one else is.
[00:19:13.703 --> 00:19:16.264]  It just so happens they're top experts.
[00:19:16.684 --> 00:19:19.305]  Yeah, and you know, again, the molten metal is never addressed.
[00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:20.646]  It's not addressed in this.
[00:19:20.986 --> 00:19:27.229]  And now they're making it into a standards issue and saying that skyscrapers need to re-evaluate how they've been built.
[00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:28.490]  I mean, it's a total lie!
[00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:36.234]  Plus, this thing had a special bunker built inside of it to withstand nuclear attacks, but it magically, you put a big lighter to it, it just combines.
[00:19:36.354 --> 00:19:43.719]  Hey, you know what's really upsetting is that, again, this was New York's number one spook house, located in the center of Manhattan.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.762]  Largest CIA base outside of Langley, Virginia.
[00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:49.844]  FBI, largest secret service office in the world.
[00:19:51.425 --> 00:19:53.067]  And the Office of Emergency Management.
[00:19:53.127 --> 00:19:55.689]  But now the building has a small fire and it's falling on its own?
[00:19:55.709 --> 00:19:59.472]  Well, the Office of Emergency Management was also hooked into the Pentagon 24-7.
[00:19:59.813 --> 00:20:01.114]  We show that in Fabled Enemies.
[00:20:01.414 --> 00:20:04.337]  And it had blueprints of every single building in New York City.
[00:20:04.917 --> 00:20:16.908]  And in Fabled Enemies, we show you how immediately after the building collapsed, the FBI set up teams with binoculars watching the rescue workers to make sure they didn't take anything out of that building that was incriminating.
[00:20:17.068 --> 00:20:21.438]  Now Jason, I want you to set up InfoWars reporter Shane Geiger for 30 minutes tomorrow.
[00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:22.921]  You're sitting in for me as I get ready to go to Denver.
[00:20:23.201 --> 00:20:26.809]  We need to go to Professor Francis A. Boyle here in just a moment.
[00:20:26.829 --> 00:20:27.290]  Do we have him?
[00:20:28.803 --> 00:20:29.364]  Yes, he's all set.
[00:20:29.444 --> 00:20:29.904]  Okay, good.
[00:20:29.924 --> 00:20:31.466]  I don't want to make him hold anymore.
[00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:32.647]  We just got overbooked today.
[00:20:32.687 --> 00:20:33.908]  His information is so important.
[00:20:34.249 --> 00:20:39.454]  Shane, let me set you up, because you went to the SNS report for 30 minutes tomorrow, at least with Jason.
[00:20:40.355 --> 00:20:44.579]  So let me have Trey and Jason right now call you and get that set up.
[00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:46.261]  Thank you, Jason Burmas, for that information.
[00:20:46.281 --> 00:20:46.581]  Thank you.
[00:20:47.242 --> 00:20:49.143]  All right, this is a very, very serious issue.
[00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:54.085]  Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize, I was screwing around earlier here in the studio, but Jason's about to leave town.
[00:20:54.406 --> 00:20:56.447]  He's been with us for five months, so we're just having some fun.
[00:20:56.847 --> 00:21:01.069]  Very, very dark times, very, very serious things that we are dealing with here.
[00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.649]  Thank you.
[00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:03.210]  Shane Geiger, we'll talk to you tomorrow.
[00:21:04.411 --> 00:21:05.131]  It was a pleasure, Alex.
[00:21:05.512 --> 00:21:05.832]  You bet.
[00:21:05.852 --> 00:21:06.152]  Thank you.
[00:21:06.172 --> 00:21:07.632]  You can go through it all tomorrow with people.
[00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:10.654]  Okay, for the next 45 minutes, I am very honored.
[00:21:10.674 --> 00:21:18.377]  We're going to skip a few of the breaks for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InfoWars.com streamlisters because this is too important information in the time we have left.
[00:21:19.178 --> 00:21:25.621]  If I went over Professor Boyle's bio, it would take hours, but he's written international weapons, bioweapons conventions.
[00:21:26.301 --> 00:21:29.843]  He's been a top-level analyst for the federal government in that capacity.
[00:21:31.043 --> 00:21:34.446]  It just goes on and on with his lengthy bio.
[00:21:35.726 --> 00:21:49.976]  And last time he was on with us, I guess about a year and a half ago, an article that Steve Watson wrote about it was published in scores of newspapers and one of the largest magazines in the country and some foreign newspapers as well, dealing with the fact that he was saying the anthrax was an inside job.
[00:21:50.416 --> 00:21:54.659]  Now I've got my mother-in-law that doesn't even believe my show calling up thinking the government did it.
[00:21:55.259 --> 00:21:56.220]  Should we put him on the list now?
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:56.541]  I'm sure.
[00:21:57.281 --> 00:22:01.066]  Now I've got just all over, everyone saying it's complete bull.
[00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:03.288]  Mainstream media saying it's complete bull.
[00:22:03.308 --> 00:22:04.349]  You look at the whole story.
[00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:12.439]  They grab this other Patsy, put him in the hospital, murder him clearly, then say that he was always who they knew did it, while they persecuted Steven Hatfield.
[00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:20.763]  We have this other guy, Dr. Philip Zach, breaking in to the bioweapons lab when he didn't even work there, not getting in trouble, still at another bioweapons lab.
[00:22:21.003 --> 00:22:23.284]  It's the most weaponized US anthrax ever seen.
[00:22:23.504 --> 00:22:27.966]  The FBI destroys the original samples so that it can't be proven and so they can claim that
[00:22:29.927 --> 00:22:30.047]  Yes.
[00:22:47.193 --> 00:23:00.785]  Give us some of your background though and your expertise on this and your bold stance a year and a half ago that's now being echoed by people at Fort Detrick saying Ivins couldn't have done this and as the plot really thickens and as their cover-up implodes.
[00:23:02.566 --> 00:23:02.767]  Right.
[00:23:02.967 --> 00:23:11.054]  Well, the day the technology on the Daschle letter was revealed in the New York Times
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:20.763]  I immediately called Marion Spike Bowman, who is a high-level counterintelligence official at the FBI.
[00:23:21.523 --> 00:23:31.086]  And in fact, it turns out, was also the person who spiked the FBI's warrant for the Moussaoui computer.
[00:23:31.986 --> 00:23:33.487]  But that's another issue.
[00:23:33.707 --> 00:23:35.787]  But before we go, tell folks who you are.
[00:23:38.773 --> 00:23:39.454]  I'm getting to that.
[00:23:39.974 --> 00:23:59.266]  He knew me because I had drafted the United States Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 that was passed unanimously by both houses of the United States Congress and signed into law by President Bush Sr.
[00:23:59.927 --> 00:24:01.888]  That legislation was the U.S.
[00:24:01.968 --> 00:24:06.771]  domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention
[00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:16.492]  And Mr. Bowman and I had met each other at a terrorism conference at the University of Michigan Law School.
[00:24:17.973 --> 00:24:36.845]  In any event, I told Mr. Bowman, this was in October of 2001, that the only people who had the capability to do this would be those individuals working at either United States government labs
[00:24:37.834 --> 00:25:02.505]  uh... or uh... private contractors uh... and things of this nature and that it obviously uh... seem to me this was u s government uh... related um... he took the uh... information down and uh... said he would pass it on to the appropriate people handing the handling the investigation i hung up
[00:25:03.459 --> 00:25:10.147]  And then it occurred to me that I had a complete list of who all these people were and what these labs were.
[00:25:11.231 --> 00:25:15.052]  Going back to my work on getting the legislation through.
[00:25:15.212 --> 00:25:15.772]  Absolutely.
[00:25:15.852 --> 00:25:33.437]  We're going to skip this break for stations out there and then just come right back into the main segment in four minutes with our guest, a really top bioweapons expert, helped write some of the major international treaties for the United States, Francis A. Boyle, and we are continuing skipping this break.
[00:25:35.658 --> 00:25:37.158]  Okay, Mr. Boyle, continue.
[00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:39.239]  Oh, sure.
[00:25:41.397 --> 00:25:49.860]  I called him back and I said, you know, I have a complete list here of when the program was in the public record.
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.622]  And here's some of the names and some of the facilities.
[00:25:55.162 --> 00:26:03.345]  And I went through, through not all of it, but I went, you know, I went down the list and I told him where he could get this list.
[00:26:04.365 --> 00:26:10.027]  And then I said, and it's also been reported this summer that the CIA was engaged in a
[00:26:10.834 --> 00:26:15.515]  uh... anthrax work as well uh... you could get the uh... c.i.a.
[00:26:15.575 --> 00:26:18.036]  list from the uh... from the c.i.a.
[00:26:19.117 --> 00:26:24.738]  and then you know we talked some more and he said well he you know the f.b.i.
[00:26:24.798 --> 00:26:37.462]  was was working with fort detrick and i said well fort detrick could very well be the problem here uh... that you had uh... someone like a timothy mcveigh
[00:26:38.194 --> 00:26:42.676]  Who was once on the reservation and now off the reservation.
[00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:49.158]  So he said again he would communicate this to the people in charge of the investigation.
[00:26:49.518 --> 00:26:54.500]  Instead they ran around everywhere saying that it was somebody in a bathtub or in a bucket making it.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:04.924]  And now we know the White House ordered Robert Mueller to say it was Iraq, that it was Al Qaeda, and boy that really shows them being complicit.
[00:27:04.944 --> 00:27:05.684]  But please continue.
[00:27:06.775 --> 00:27:19.121]  Well, it was even worse than that, Alex, in that at that point, you know, I had assumed good faith on the part of the FBI in this investigation because, you know, it had killed several people.
[00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:30.106]  It had shut down the United States Congress, which I think was probably the greatest political crime ever inflicted on our republic in its history.
[00:27:32.003 --> 00:27:39.684]  But then I read that the FBI had authorized the destruction of the U.S.
[00:27:39.804 --> 00:27:45.025]  government's Ames Strain collection in Ames, Iowa.
[00:27:46.205 --> 00:27:50.606]  Ames Strain was the strain responsible for U.S.
[00:27:51.646 --> 00:27:53.467]  biowarfare programs.
[00:27:53.567 --> 00:27:54.627]  Everyone knew that.
[00:27:55.907 --> 00:27:58.027]  And indeed, that's all now been confirmed.
[00:27:58.067 --> 00:28:00.008]  You can read it in today's New York Times.
[00:28:00.028 --> 00:28:01.208]  There's a story right in there.
[00:28:02.202 --> 00:28:06.164]  Of course, we all said this six and a half years ago, but we're still cooks.
[00:28:07.204 --> 00:28:07.425]  Right.
[00:28:07.545 --> 00:28:31.476]  So, when I read the FBI had destroyed the entire Ames Strain collection in Ames, Iowa, I knew a cover-up was underway, because you could have taken the FBI, legitimate scientific researchers could have taken that collection and used it to genetically reconstruct
[00:28:32.202 --> 00:28:38.785]  Precisely where and when and how the weapon came from.
[00:28:40.205 --> 00:28:41.326]  And they destroyed it.
[00:28:42.246 --> 00:28:45.888]  This was clearly a federal crime in its own right.
[00:28:46.968 --> 00:28:48.329]  Destruction of justice.
[00:28:48.829 --> 00:28:53.951]  So it was obvious that that evidence all should have been preserved as evidence of a crime.
[00:28:54.031 --> 00:29:00.134]  I used to teach criminal law here, so it was obvious they were covering up and covering up
[00:29:01.229 --> 00:29:01.429]  I think
[00:29:21.582 --> 00:29:26.925]  Instance of destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice by the FBI.
[00:29:27.705 --> 00:29:29.286]  As hurriedly as they could.
[00:29:30.246 --> 00:29:33.248]  Okay, we're going to come back in with some stations.
[00:29:33.288 --> 00:29:35.649]  Joining us to continue right now with our guest.
[00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.811]  Francis Boyle.
[00:29:51.738 --> 00:29:54.461]  He's a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law.
[00:29:54.481 --> 00:29:57.664]  He's a graduate of the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School.
[00:29:57.684 --> 00:29:58.765]  He's also received a Ph.D.
[00:29:58.805 --> 00:30:01.547]  in political science from Harvard University.
[00:30:06.334 --> 00:30:16.761]  Just had a bio, it's too long to go over, but he's written international bioweapons conventions for the Federal Government, advised Congress, written some of the biggest publications out there.
[00:30:17.601 --> 00:30:20.523]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:30:21.043 --> 00:30:26.827]  He's currently a member of the Nobel Prize for Governor George H. Ryan Committee.
[00:30:28.263 --> 00:30:35.669]  Okay, continuing, sir, with the FBI covering up this evidence, covering up the original AIM strain, destroying them.
[00:30:35.889 --> 00:30:39.993]  Then they find other samples that other people had that they gave them.
[00:30:40.013 --> 00:30:41.254]  They destroy it immediately.
[00:30:41.274 --> 00:30:44.497]  You're saying crimes, obstruction of justice.
[00:30:45.197 --> 00:30:46.418]  Why are they covering it up?
[00:30:46.438 --> 00:30:49.281]  Well, then we have the White House on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic.
[00:30:49.941 --> 00:30:52.984]  Weeks before the anthrax letters show up, admitting that arrogantly.
[00:30:53.424 --> 00:30:55.526]  We have political enemies of the Bushes getting it.
[00:30:55.807 --> 00:30:58.709]  They use it as a smoke screen to pass the Patriot Act.
[00:30:58.729 --> 00:31:03.574]  They're pressuring the FBI, now public, ordering them to say Al-Qaeda, Al-CIA did it.
[00:31:04.075 --> 00:31:11.061]  I mean, this is the most open and shut case ever for the federal government, criminal elements of it, launching the anthrax attack.
[00:31:11.281 --> 00:31:13.003]  Then you have the cover-up, the patsies.
[00:31:13.664 --> 00:31:14.825]  I mean, break that down for us.
[00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:17.615]  Yeah, I think it's all clear.
[00:31:17.635 --> 00:31:45.375]  On the first weekend in November I went out to Harvard where I was running a workshop on biological weapons and I publicly stated at the time that in my opinion, my professional opinion, it was either elements of the United States government itself or contractors working for the United States government that was behind the anthrax attack and my
[00:31:45.854 --> 00:32:00.917]  Colleague at the time, Professor Jonathan King of MIT, who's a microbiologist and runs their electron microscope lab, independently said the exact same thing I did.
[00:32:02.457 --> 00:32:11.959]  And I gave interviews on Fox and the BBC and Pacifica saying this the first week in November
[00:32:13.471 --> 00:32:33.481]  So it's been very clear, and the reason is that for the FBI cover-up, it would lead back to a secret, covert, illegal, and criminal offensive biological weapons program involving anthrax.
[00:32:34.222 --> 00:32:39.565]  And I say it's criminal because I was the person who drafted the statute making it a crime.
[00:32:41.245 --> 00:32:42.366]  And that's
[00:32:42.884 --> 00:32:51.828]  That's what's going on here, that's why all the lying and covering it up all along, and they're still doing it today.
[00:32:51.949 --> 00:33:02.094]  If you read the investigation, the press conference they heard earlier this week, by the FBI, it does not add up at all.
[00:33:02.914 --> 00:33:07.556]  If you read the article in today's New York Times, it doesn't add up indeed.
[00:33:08.076 --> 00:33:10.978]  It appears from today's New York Times
[00:33:11.741 --> 00:33:41.373]  The FBI, for example, then set the investigation up by scientists in such a way that no one knew exactly what they were doing, and could not communicate with anyone else, and only communicated with the FBI, and only looked at samples provided to them by the FBI, and had to take on good faith from the FBI what the samples were.
[00:33:42.054 --> 00:33:49.497]  So, you have the case where the FBI completely controlled, dominated the scientific investigation.
[00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:52.612]  Including the timing.
[00:33:52.932 --> 00:33:58.595]  Well, Dr. Boyle, I want to go through that, and as best we can piece together who exactly did it and why they did it.
[00:33:59.095 --> 00:34:05.678]  But when the mainline public on the street at coffee shops are saying, can you believe the government launched the anthrax attack?
[00:34:06.098 --> 00:34:06.799]  They're in trouble.
[00:34:06.819 --> 00:34:09.440]  I mean, the words out, the White House was on the drug that fights it.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.161]  The words out, it went to their enemies.
[00:34:11.201 --> 00:34:13.342]  The words out, they set this last guy up.
[00:34:13.942 --> 00:34:16.243]  I mean, I think we have a crisis of confidence here.
[00:34:16.263 --> 00:34:20.024]  Do you think the FBI knows just how ridiculous they look right now?
[00:34:21.545 --> 00:34:27.046]  Well, Alex, I think the important issue to realize now is this.
[00:34:27.487 --> 00:34:33.329]  You know, the FBI's been lying and covering up on this at least since the time I called Bowman.
[00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:43.412]  But there is today in existence a stockpile of super weapons-grade anthrax.
[00:34:44.634 --> 00:34:54.059]  That is under the control of the original perpetrators of the anthrax attacks of October 2001.
[00:34:54.739 --> 00:35:09.786]  And that stockpile can and will be used again when their masters decide that it would be politically convenient
[00:35:10.492 --> 00:35:13.697]  to scare and terrorize the American people.
[00:35:13.717 --> 00:35:15.099]  Alright, we're going to skip this break too.
[00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:16.742]  Hold on, I just want stations to know that.
[00:35:17.062 --> 00:35:18.885]  Infowars.com listeners, we're going to continue.
[00:35:18.905 --> 00:35:20.647]  Everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes.
[00:35:20.688 --> 00:35:22.110]  Got to tune over to Infowars.com.
[00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.533]  Here we go with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:27.810]  Okay, Doc, I mean that's the point I keep making.
[00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:37.554]  If they carried out the attacks and all the evidence, I mean it's 100%, they did it, from motive to means to the evidence to the witnesses to the Cipro, all of it, it's ridiculous.
[00:35:38.274 --> 00:35:41.736]  A, what did they think they were doing, because they haven't gotten away with it.
[00:35:41.776 --> 00:35:43.797]  I mean, this is really getting them more than even 9-11.
[00:35:45.097 --> 00:35:49.318]  And then B, getting into what you just mentioned.
[00:35:49.358 --> 00:35:50.558]  Yes, they're still in power.
[00:35:50.598 --> 00:35:51.438]  They're still going.
[00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:55.599]  They could aerosolize this and say Al-Qaeda did it and launch an attack on Iran.
[00:35:56.039 --> 00:35:56.759]  Please continue.
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:05.041]  Well, they could launch another attack on us, and including on Congress, the judiciary, the media.
[00:36:05.081 --> 00:36:06.962]  You know, the media is the force of the state.
[00:36:07.062 --> 00:36:08.502]  You think this was a beta test?
[00:36:08.522 --> 00:36:09.682]  Do you think this was a beta test?
[00:36:10.762 --> 00:36:11.042]  Pardon me?
[00:36:11.683 --> 00:36:13.443]  Do you think that this was a beta test, then?
[00:36:14.585 --> 00:36:15.585]  What do you mean by a beta test?
[00:36:15.625 --> 00:36:20.588]  The first anthrax attack was a beta test to see what the media would do, how Congress would respond.
[00:36:22.368 --> 00:36:34.073]  Well, I believe the first anthrax attack was designed to ram through the Patriot Act because Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy were holding it up.
[00:36:34.974 --> 00:36:39.816]  And once the anthrax occurred, the attacks occurred, it rammed right through.
[00:36:41.657 --> 00:36:55.426]  On the renewal of the USA Patriot Act, Senator Feingold was holding it up, and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, some white-powdered substance appeared at the, I think, one of the Senate office buildings.
[00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:56.006]  Yeah, I remember that.
[00:36:56.106 --> 00:37:02.130]  There was an anthrax scare, and then all of a sudden, the renewal of the Patriot Act went through.
[00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.551]  Now, that was not real anthrax.
[00:37:03.571 --> 00:37:06.333]  Well, I mean, this doesn't have to be real anthrax this time.
[00:37:06.493 --> 00:37:07.173]  It's a reminder.
[00:37:07.193 --> 00:37:09.555]  Before your question on the media,
[00:37:10.488 --> 00:37:20.099]  I think the culprits here wanted to send a message to the news media as well, that if you really cover this story, you risk your lives.
[00:37:21.343 --> 00:37:27.126]  No, that's it, and then the people that did a story on the Bush daughters falling down drunk in Austin, the editor gets the first letter.
[00:37:27.786 --> 00:37:31.408]  I mean, so this is a thinly-veiled threat to everyone.
[00:37:32.048 --> 00:37:40.493]  So I guess the perpetrators, that's why Congress goes along with the wars and goes along with all of it, because I've talked to people in Congress who privately are like, yeah, yeah, we know what happened.
[00:37:40.913 --> 00:37:45.995]  And I mean, do you agree that it's just an open mafia message that is what you're saying, and that Congress knows?
[00:37:46.075 --> 00:37:46.956]  I mean, they know who did it.
[00:37:48.898 --> 00:37:51.819]  I think, you know, people in Congress, I stay in touch with them.
[00:37:51.899 --> 00:37:53.179]  I've sent them my materials.
[00:37:53.339 --> 00:37:55.259]  You know, they're smart, intelligent people.
[00:37:55.899 --> 00:37:58.460]  I think they know who is responsible for this.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:03.441]  I don't think they believe the cock and bull FBI explanation.
[00:38:04.121 --> 00:38:05.141]  But of course they're afraid.
[00:38:05.181 --> 00:38:06.421]  Their lives are on the line.
[00:38:07.402 --> 00:38:14.763]  I think what we have to do now is insist on a full-scale congressional investigation.
[00:38:15.211 --> 00:38:20.015]  Not some type of Presidential Commission cover-up along the lines of the 9-11 report.
[00:38:20.536 --> 00:38:25.160]  But then the neocons will probably just mail 100 letters of anthrax.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.442]  I guess the whole nation is kind of held hostage.
[00:38:27.462 --> 00:38:36.689]  We're going to come back to the full audience, recap that, and get into your idea, your plan to deal with this, and then cover any other evidence that backs up what you're saying with our guest.
[00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:37.310]  Here we go.
[00:38:40.333 --> 00:38:41.574]  Dr. Francis Boyle.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:53.346]  One of the former top bioweapons experts for the federal government helped write some of the major bioweapons conventions internationally for the United States.
[00:38:54.967 --> 00:38:59.670]  Day one, he tried to help with the investigation and found out who was really behind it.
[00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.071]  These are hardcore killers.
[00:39:02.311 --> 00:39:04.953]  And they'll do anything to scare you into submission after their little
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:10.123]  Little event, they pulled off on 9-11, they weren't done, they launched their anthrax attack.
[00:39:10.563 --> 00:39:21.211]  And they did their dark winter scenario a few years before that, a congressionally funded drill of massive anthrax spraying in Texas, in Oklahoma, and martial law being declared.
[00:39:21.971 --> 00:39:26.735]  And you better believe, ladies and gentlemen, they got private contractors ready to spray it on your cities.
[00:39:27.435 --> 00:39:30.738]  And then they'll grab some guy with a beard and put him on TV and say he did it.
[00:39:30.758 --> 00:39:31.778]  It might even be a hologram.
[00:39:32.159 --> 00:39:35.761]  I mean, these guys are just, there's no end to what they'll do.
[00:39:36.382 --> 00:39:38.203]  And Dr. Boyle is our guest.
[00:39:39.324 --> 00:39:43.627]  During the last segment, you just started calling for a congressional investigation.
[00:39:43.667 --> 00:39:46.449]  The country's being held hostage by the real terrorist.
[00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.790]  You've got the floor.
[00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:51.693]  I'd like you to talk more about that and then go back into evidence because it's so voluminous.
[00:39:51.733 --> 00:39:52.994]  Anything else you'd like to talk about?
[00:39:54.727 --> 00:40:16.026]  Right, well, we need hearings along the lines of what we had in the Watergate hearings under President Nixon, where we have open public hearings by a joint committee of Congress, because this attack was designed to shut Congress down, which it did.
[00:40:16.086 --> 00:40:20.610]  It succeeded, to the best of my knowledge, the first time in the history of our republic,
[00:40:21.269 --> 00:40:25.331]  Congress was actually shut down and rendered inoperative.
[00:40:25.411 --> 00:40:27.872]  The House went out of business.
[00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:33.274]  The Senate said it would stay in session, but with the House out of business, you can't do business.
[00:40:34.334 --> 00:40:40.217]  So this is a political crime of the first magnitude.
[00:40:40.657 --> 00:40:42.978]  The Supreme Court, as well, also shut down.
[00:40:43.638 --> 00:40:46.359]  And the media were attacked, our fourth estate.
[00:40:47.077 --> 00:40:51.700]  Of course, the presidency and the executive branch was not attacked.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.163]  I leave that to you to figure it out, but we do know the White House was on Cipro.
[00:40:58.643 --> 00:41:11.710]  So, that's really what we need, and maybe if there are open public hearings by Congress, people put under oath with subpoena power, members of Congress then might feel some protection.
[00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:18.045]  from further threats by the people currently under control of the anthrax.
[00:41:18.485 --> 00:41:42.164]  You also have to tie into this the large numbers of dead microbiologists that have appeared since around the summer before these events, when the New York Times revealed the existence of the covert anthrax weapons programs
[00:41:42.702 --> 00:41:44.643]  Run by the CIA and Battelle.
[00:41:45.064 --> 00:41:47.285]  And that, too, is in the public record.
[00:41:47.725 --> 00:41:49.587]  Yeah, the list keeps going.
[00:41:49.787 --> 00:41:55.530]  Ivins is only the latest dead microbiologist, so you are correct.
[00:41:56.771 --> 00:41:58.833]  These culprits are playing for keeps.
[00:41:58.953 --> 00:42:01.835]  They are prepared to kill people.
[00:42:02.695 --> 00:42:03.936]  They've tried to kill people.
[00:42:04.036 --> 00:42:05.237]  I think they have killed people.
[00:42:05.899 --> 00:42:11.362]  Well, there's no doubt under PDD 51, the Continuative Government System has taken over the government.
[00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:21.626]  Congress knows they were hit by a biological attack from the executive branch and the shadow government, controlled by foreign agencies, foreign intelligence operations, British and Israeli, predominantly.
[00:42:22.307 --> 00:42:26.929]  And they have now bullied the media and the Congress into full submission.
[00:42:28.823 --> 00:42:31.285]  They are hopping mad at the Russians for not submitting.
[00:42:31.325 --> 00:42:32.946]  God knows what they'll pull on them now.
[00:42:33.846 --> 00:42:41.510]  And we are completely controlled by megalomaniacs who have limitless will, dark will, to do God knows what.
[00:42:41.891 --> 00:42:45.453]  Mr. Boyle, I mean, I can't imagine a more nightmare scenario.
[00:42:45.513 --> 00:42:49.515]  And it's so transparent because they want it to be transparent, don't they?
[00:42:51.738 --> 00:43:00.684]  Well, I think it's transparent for people who are really following what's going on and adding it up, but I don't think for the vast majority of the American people.
[00:43:01.104 --> 00:43:14.372]  I do think you are correct in your analysis that the Presidential Doctrine for Continuity of Government was put into effect on September 11th, and it's still in operation today.
[00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:18.435]  And that we do have, in fact, a secret government that
[00:43:18.973 --> 00:43:22.335]  You know, he's really running things behind the scenes.
[00:43:22.435 --> 00:43:24.916]  Probably Cheney is in charge of it.
[00:43:25.796 --> 00:43:28.017]  And so there are really two governments out there.
[00:43:29.078 --> 00:43:31.539]  And that can account for a lot of anomalies.
[00:43:31.699 --> 00:43:39.083]  For example, what happened at the Minot Air Force Base with the nuclear cruise missiles.
[00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:46.666]  That decision to deploy those nuclear cruise missiles had to come directly from a chain of command.
[00:43:46.706 --> 00:43:47.747]  It was not a mistake.
[00:43:48.451 --> 00:43:54.235]  And with the continuity of government, then there are now two chains of command.
[00:43:54.696 --> 00:44:06.084]  So I think you can add up a lot of things by realizing that, you know, there's the open government and then there's the COG in operation.
[00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:06.525]  Right.
[00:44:06.685 --> 00:44:17.153]  Professor Boyle, a lot of people that don't understand history or the way subterfuge works, they wonder why you're alive, why I'm alive, why so many others are alive, if this is all true.
[00:44:18.354 --> 00:44:20.956]  And I would just say it's because they don't want to validate what we've said.
[00:44:20.996 --> 00:44:22.797]  They don't want to underline our words.
[00:44:22.817 --> 00:44:25.158]  They don't want to highlight what we've said and done.
[00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:28.080]  But I do feel the wings of death flapping about.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:28.861]  I've been threatened.
[00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:30.141]  I've had all sorts of other stuff happen.
[00:44:30.782 --> 00:44:32.223]  A lot of other people have been killed.
[00:44:32.263 --> 00:44:34.684]  So it's not a joke to me, but I just think my lucky stars.
[00:44:34.704 --> 00:44:36.726]  Thank God every day I'm still here.
[00:44:38.026 --> 00:44:44.208]  But what's your take on why other whistleblowers and other prominent people are still alive?
[00:44:44.268 --> 00:44:48.230]  If these guys are such murderers and such killers, why they haven't come after us?
[00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.431]  Well, Dr. Ivins is not alive.
[00:44:51.491 --> 00:44:56.993]  He joined the growing list of microbiologists who are now dead.
[00:44:57.889 --> 00:45:06.233]  I can't recall the last time I looked at that list, but it was somewhere in the area of 15 to 20 microbiologists have died.
[00:45:06.293 --> 00:45:07.214]  It's a lot more than that.
[00:45:07.974 --> 00:45:09.775]  Yeah, maybe 20 or something like that.
[00:45:10.736 --> 00:45:14.678]  If you look at it globally, it's like 20 in the U.S.
[00:45:15.058 --> 00:45:17.579]  being shot in the back of the head, being tortured to death, being drowned.
[00:45:17.919 --> 00:45:19.280]  It's hundreds worldwide.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:20.300]  Right.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.743]  I think disposing of people who don't directly know what's going on.
[00:45:28.763 --> 00:45:32.244]  I know, you know, Senator Wellstone disappeared too.
[00:45:33.485 --> 00:45:40.569]  So, you know, I take it the reason others are around is that they don't really care.
[00:45:41.049 --> 00:45:42.650]  They have all the levers of power.
[00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:47.512]  No, no, they're actually glad we're here saying they control the Congress and murder whoever they want.
[00:45:47.532 --> 00:45:48.153]  They enjoy it.
[00:45:48.653 --> 00:45:51.815]  And all the big guerrillas that work in Army Intelligence think it's real funny.
[00:45:52.537 --> 00:45:56.620]  They love their cocaine money, they love their houses in Maui, they love butchering this country.
[00:45:56.921 --> 00:45:57.461]  Wide open.
[00:45:57.501 --> 00:45:58.242]  Good job, guys.
[00:45:58.542 --> 00:45:59.803]  Please continue, Dr. Boyle.
[00:46:00.804 --> 00:46:05.167]  Well, I don't think they think we're very effective one way or the other.
[00:46:05.187 --> 00:46:07.289]  Otherwise, they would take us out, sure.
[00:46:08.547 --> 00:46:09.468]  Well, you know, it could be the twilight of
[00:46:32.202 --> 00:46:34.303]  The American Republic, I hate to say that.
[00:46:34.563 --> 00:46:45.205]  You know, I've been a lawyer since January 10, 1977, taking an oath to uphold the constitutional laws of the United States, as my father was before me.
[00:46:46.346 --> 00:46:51.307]  And it could be we're at the end of the line here for democracy in America.
[00:46:52.895 --> 00:46:58.801]  That's right, you're a top constitutional law scholar as well, we just can't cover all of your illustrious background.
[00:46:58.901 --> 00:47:04.366]  Let's go over more of the evidence, more areas with the curious case of Dr. Ivins.
[00:47:04.426 --> 00:47:08.370]  I mean, the media, you notice, it was so hard to find that he died in government custody.
[00:47:09.031 --> 00:47:09.131]  It is.
[00:47:09.151 --> 00:47:11.713]  I mean, if you just read any of the accounts, I mean, now, surprisingly, you even have
[00:47:31.865 --> 00:47:42.393]  People in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, experts, microbiologists, former biowarfare people saying they don't believe Ivins did it.
[00:47:43.154 --> 00:47:43.814]  That's correct.
[00:47:44.174 --> 00:47:47.637]  That's how flimsy the cover-up has become.
[00:47:48.197 --> 00:47:52.500]  Again, just read today's New York Times.
[00:47:53.541 --> 00:47:59.466]  The more facts come out, the harder it comes to explain any of these things.
[00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:02.633]  I don't know what to say.
[00:48:02.773 --> 00:48:13.082]  Why do you think they rushed out and grabbed Ivins and killed him, and then made the ridiculous story up about, oh, he's been our main suspect for four years, when just a year ago they were saying the only suspect was Hatfield?
[00:48:13.142 --> 00:48:17.766]  I mean, is that a total contempt for the public's memory, or what is that?
[00:48:20.028 --> 00:48:23.431]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:48:23.571 --> 00:48:26.153]  I don't know if Ivins was killed one way or the other.
[00:48:28.649 --> 00:48:40.513]  You know, they first blamed it on Hatfield, knowing he wasn't responsible, but that could stall and delay everything for a long time, and see if they could get Hatfield to crack up, and he didn't.
[00:48:41.493 --> 00:48:42.233]  He fought back.
[00:48:43.594 --> 00:48:54.917]  Ivins, so then they moved to him, and they got him to crack up, and either he was off by himself, or we still don't know the circumstances one way or the other.
[00:48:55.447 --> 00:49:02.214]  So now they have a dead man, and dead men tell no tales, so they just pin it on the dead man, the dead microbiologist.
[00:49:02.735 --> 00:49:04.797]  Yeah, it's easy, they have a dead defendant.
[00:49:05.802 --> 00:49:11.863]  Talking about the FBI, they've always been hooked in with the Mafia since their conception, during Prohibition, being paid off.
[00:49:12.303 --> 00:49:19.085]  So from their zenith, or really birth I should say, from their genesis, they have been mobsters.
[00:49:21.125 --> 00:49:25.046]  Now, I mean, I've seen the FBI out on the streets, and they're really scary people.
[00:49:25.066 --> 00:49:31.407]  I mean, do you think the average FBI agent really understands they're working for basically a Gestapo organization?
[00:49:32.318 --> 00:49:46.004]  Well, actually, a Mr. Swearegan, who had been an FBI agent and retired and was decorated, wrote a book on the FBI and called it the American Gestapo, repeatedly.
[00:49:47.785 --> 00:49:49.366]  He was a veteran FBI agent.
[00:49:49.826 --> 00:49:51.166]  I think that is correct.
[00:49:51.567 --> 00:49:54.368]  The last time we discussed the matter,
[00:49:55.503 --> 00:50:21.626]  I think I told you that two FBI agents, well, one agent for the FBI and another for the FBI-CIA Joint Terrorism Task Force, showed up at my office, interrogated me for an hour, tried to get me to become an informant on my Arab and Muslim clients, which would have violated their constitutional rights and my ethical obligations as an attorney.
[00:50:22.142 --> 00:50:41.332]  Of course, I refused to become an informant for the FBI, but I did tell them that I was trying to cooperate with the FBI on the anthrax investigation, and told them of my phone calls there to Mr. Bowman to try to do something on the anthrax investigation.
[00:50:42.013 --> 00:50:49.837]  And then the FBI-CIA went out and put me on all the United States government's terrorist watch lists.
[00:50:50.399 --> 00:50:51.020]  Every one of them.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:55.765]  My lawyer says there are five or six of them, and as far as he could figure out, I'm on all of them.
[00:50:56.466 --> 00:51:08.420]  So, that gives you a pretty good idea of what's going on here, that one guy trying to help unravel the anthrax investigation gets put on the terrorist watch list.
[00:51:09.727 --> 00:51:15.910]  Well, you know, I know it's all about power and who wins, but there's no doubt that I'm trying to defend this country, what's left of it.
[00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:16.551]  So are you.
[00:51:17.651 --> 00:51:24.475]  And, you know, guys, we don't expect you to quit the FBI or even stand up for the country, but at least you can passively not join the evil.
[00:51:24.535 --> 00:51:27.456]  I mean, is it that much fun to destroy America?
[00:51:27.516 --> 00:51:29.297]  I mean, I don't understand the enjoyment.
[00:51:29.778 --> 00:51:31.018]  Where do they find these people?
[00:51:31.999 --> 00:51:38.102]  Well, we have to remember there were some good, solid FBI people there up in Minneapolis
[00:51:38.743 --> 00:51:42.466]  Trying to get that, uh, warrant into... But notice they're always off in a field office.
[00:51:42.706 --> 00:51:44.047]  I understand it's compartmentalized.
[00:51:44.287 --> 00:51:44.447]  Yeah.
[00:51:44.647 --> 00:51:44.867]  Right.
[00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:55.254]  But they tried... Those in the field, Crowley and the rest of them, tried very hard to get that, uh, warrant into Moussaoui's computer that very well could have unraveled, uh, 9-11.
[00:51:56.701 --> 00:52:04.185]  And that was killed by Marion Spike Bowman, who was the same guy I was dealing with in good faith.
[00:52:04.205 --> 00:52:15.512]  And then by the way, the FBI agents that blocked the Anthrax and the 9-11 investigation even before, they all got record cash bonuses, and those that tried to stop the attacks, they got demoted.
[00:52:16.832 --> 00:52:18.293]  Right.
[00:52:18.613 --> 00:52:24.777]  The people who were in charge of the cover-ups on both 9-11 and the Anthrax have all been promoted, which
[00:52:25.382 --> 00:52:29.564]  Indicates they've done what their masters wanted them to do.
[00:52:30.385 --> 00:52:42.170]  And I think the reason why, eventually, if we can unravel who was behind the anthrax attacks, we're going to find out who really was behind 9-11.
[00:52:45.854 --> 00:52:49.916]  You know, they're so desperate to cover everything up and lie about it.
[00:52:50.216 --> 00:52:57.940]  I know you have a lot of gravitas, sir, so you like to be very careful with what you say, but do you think a person of interest needs to be looked at as this Philip Zack person, or is he another Red Herring?
[00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:02.563]  I really don't know much about Mr. Zack.
[00:53:03.263 --> 00:53:13.749]  Just what I've read in the public record, but certainly at the top of everyone's list should be Mr. Patrick, who did this type of work for the CIA, and
[00:53:14.611 --> 00:53:18.152]  Ken Albeck, who did this type of work for the Soviet Union.
[00:53:18.652 --> 00:53:24.494]  Indeed, Albeck has made statements in the public that are inconsistent and simply not true.
[00:53:25.514 --> 00:53:32.376]  Albeck was brought over here by the CIA, so he's on their payroll, and Patrick was on the payroll.
[00:53:33.874 --> 00:53:36.496]  You know, certainly identify them as the top of the list.
[00:53:36.536 --> 00:53:36.956]  That's right.
[00:53:37.516 --> 00:53:45.581]  Alabeck wrote about and was over an accidental release, remember, in the Soviet Union on that... Sverdlovsk.
[00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:47.482]  Yeah, was it the Kamchatka Peninsula?
[00:53:48.082 --> 00:53:48.302]  Right.
[00:53:48.422 --> 00:53:52.725]  Well, no, Sverdlovsk, which is in central Russia.
[00:53:52.885 --> 00:53:57.988]  But you have to understand that it's just not for Dietrich here that could have done this.
[00:53:58.128 --> 00:53:59.669]  The culture
[00:54:00.562 --> 00:54:19.893]  From what I can see, it came from Fort Detrick, but again, assuming any of this information coming out is correct, 45% of it came from Fort Detrick, and 75% of it came from the Dugway Proving Ground, run by the Army, and with the CIA and Battelle working there.
[00:54:19.993 --> 00:54:28.518]  So, my guess is that the culture itself came from Fort Detrick, and then it was shipped
[00:54:28.974 --> 00:54:29.574]  All right.
[00:54:49.901 --> 00:54:53.042]  And then the electrostatic charges.
[00:54:53.502 --> 00:54:54.903]  How ridiculous is it?
[00:54:55.403 --> 00:54:58.204]  I believe it was weaponized at Dugway.
[00:54:58.324 --> 00:55:03.525]  I don't believe it was weaponized at Fort Detrick per se.
[00:55:04.585 --> 00:55:06.706]  How ridiculous is it?
[00:55:06.806 --> 00:55:10.807]  So we have a team of people here working on this.
[00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:15.789]  It's not simply a question of one or two or three people.
[00:55:16.994 --> 00:55:27.037]  And that's why we have all these big top bioweapons scientists saying you're claiming that that Ivins was able to make this in his basement?
[00:55:27.337 --> 00:55:29.738]  That he was able to get something and then weaponize it?
[00:55:29.778 --> 00:55:33.139]  You know, they're saying that's ridiculous because they know what it takes, don't they?
[00:55:33.999 --> 00:55:35.520]  Sure, it's completely preposterous.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:39.921]  Even Mr. Spurzel used to head up Fort Detrick and say it can't be done.
[00:55:40.641 --> 00:55:46.523]  So, you know, I think most of the scientists involved in the investigation
[00:55:47.895 --> 00:55:53.700]  Like me, you'd probably assume the FBI was dealing with them in good faith, but that simply isn't the case.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.621]  Has this changed your view of the world?
[00:55:55.981 --> 00:55:59.884]  You know, working on this case, seeing this, and seeing how the federal government's been behaving?
[00:56:01.465 --> 00:56:02.206]  No, not really.
[00:56:02.226 --> 00:56:04.588]  You know, I'm 58 years old.
[00:56:04.608 --> 00:56:14.415]  I'm going back to the Kennedy assassination, the two Kennedy assassinations, and the King assassination.
[00:56:15.222 --> 00:56:16.803]  This doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:56:36.613 --> 00:56:47.157]  Okay, Dr. Boyle, this has been an amazing interview, and I just want you, in the next 6-7 minutes or so, to cover any other key points, any other areas, any websites you want to plug.
[00:56:47.438 --> 00:56:48.198]  You've got the floor.
[00:56:49.458 --> 00:57:02.764]  Well, I have a book on the subject called Biowarfare and Terrorism, Clarity Press, which you can read that sets out the case and the basic points that I'm making here today.
[00:57:03.444 --> 00:57:04.725]  Everything I'm saying in there,
[00:57:06.966 --> 00:57:10.827]  ...has been confirmed by the latest revelations.
[00:57:11.888 --> 00:57:34.439]  In addition, since that book went to press, I have reviewed the Pentagon's report to Congress on their chemical and biological warfare programs, and it's very clear they are engaged in the development and use of anthrax as a weapon of warfare.
[00:57:35.526 --> 00:57:56.880]  It is also clear, if you read through there, the Pentagon, in this biowarfare program, is now testing, open-air testing, which is something that Congress passed a statute to prohibit, and yet there was put in there a presidential waiver.
[00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:00.743]  So we have to understand the
[00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:20.620]  The stockpile of this super weapons-grade anthrax is still there, probably at Dugway, or perhaps Battelle in Ohio, and waiting to be used again when the Pentagon and the CIA decide they want to terrorize the American people.
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:25.743]  Cheney has said if there's another terrorist attack, he'll claim it on Iran.
[00:58:26.744 --> 00:58:28.224]  There's an election coming up.
[00:58:29.747 --> 00:58:39.314]  That, you know, they're going to want to win for McCain, who's in the pocket of all the neoconservatives currently running the government and the continuity of government.
[00:58:39.955 --> 00:58:56.808]  So, there are a variety of occasions coming up for these people to use this anthrax and panic the American people, either towards war, towards a police state, or towards electing the presidential candidate they want.
[00:58:58.991 --> 00:59:01.051]  Amazing, absolutely amazing.
[00:59:01.432 --> 00:59:08.993]  We've got a few stations that are about to join us when we come back out of this segment, so we're going to plug the book again.
[00:59:09.013 --> 00:59:12.574]  I want everybody out there to get it, because this is life and death.
[00:59:12.614 --> 00:59:20.756]  I mean, it is a military culture to sacrifice pawns, and they have just gotten way too fast and loose.
[00:59:21.536 --> 00:59:23.476]  It's not enough to kill a million two Iraqis.
[00:59:23.536 --> 00:59:26.177]  It's not enough to bomb Serbia into the Stone Age with DU.
[00:59:27.205 --> 00:59:31.746]  You know, they see us as absolute cattle folks and this sick culture has got to be stopped.
[00:59:32.066 --> 00:59:33.227]  We're coming back live right now.
[00:59:39.469 --> 00:59:47.411]  Dr. Francis Boyle has a book out on the anthrax attacks, a scholarly detailed book that everyone needs to get and get out to their friends and family.
[00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:48.972]  This is Life and Death.
[00:59:48.992 --> 00:59:56.554]  If we don't expose these people, they're going to use terror attacks to completely overthrow the country and have a continuity of government system that even dominates Congress.
[00:59:57.884 --> 01:00:00.925]  Hell, Bush has even taken authority away from Homeland Security to himself.
[01:00:02.466 --> 01:00:05.487]  It's unprecedented, dark times, and I don't take pleasure fighting these people.
[01:00:05.567 --> 01:00:06.508]  I know, I mean, it is.
[01:00:07.668 --> 01:00:08.428]  I don't even have fear.
[01:00:08.468 --> 01:00:10.349]  I just know, man, this is serious.
[01:00:10.829 --> 01:00:12.950]  I don't like messing with these people, but I have to.
[01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:14.511]  You can't give in to them.
[01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:16.912]  And Dr. Boyle, we just commend you.
[01:00:17.772 --> 01:00:23.855]  The old 5,000-year-old system of sacrificing pawns, going back to being invented in India,
[01:00:25.265 --> 01:00:35.708]  Generals will sacrifice a thousand, ten thousand, twenty thousand troops to draw an enemy in over a ridge, thinking it's a larger force to then have their army behind the hill crush them, knowing it's going to kill their own force.
[01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:50.373]  In archery training, it's not just in the movie Braveheart, but it's historical cases of where different armies in Japan, in Europe proper, in Africa, you know, the Egyptians would fire on their own troops to kill some of the other troops.
[01:00:50.893 --> 01:00:51.814]  That's an idea.
[01:00:51.994 --> 01:00:52.794]  Collateral damage.
[01:00:53.755 --> 01:00:59.579]  And it's nothing to the war planners running our country for the big banks to mail out some anthrax and kill some people.
[01:00:59.959 --> 01:01:01.440]  It's nothing for them to kill kids now.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.041]  To kill a million two Iraqis, as I said.
[01:01:04.782 --> 01:01:08.944]  And we better realize that what's done to the Iraqis will be done to us.
[01:01:09.724 --> 01:01:10.965]  You reap what you sow.
[01:01:11.005 --> 01:01:13.847]  Dr. Boyle, can you speak to that idea and then plug your book?
[01:01:15.543 --> 01:01:16.864]  Well, sure.
[01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:21.128]  I went to the University of Chicago with all these neoconservatives.
[01:01:22.149 --> 01:01:27.294]  Wolfowitz was there, Chalabi, Kowalski, all the rest of them.
[01:01:28.335 --> 01:01:35.402]  They were getting their PhDs, and I was getting my undergraduate degree, later got my PhD from Harvard.
[01:01:36.003 --> 01:01:40.127]  I went through the exact same program that produced all these neocons.
[01:01:40.703 --> 01:02:04.692]  The political science department, Leo Strauss, the godfather of the neocons, his mentor and sponsor in Germany was Professor Carl Schmitt, who went on to become the most notorious Nazi law professor of that benighted era, and justified every hideous atrocity
[01:02:05.307 --> 01:02:08.688]  The Nazis inflicted on anyone, including the Jews.
[01:02:08.928 --> 01:02:17.231]  And now his grandchildren are Alberto Gonzalez, the current Attorney General, Mukasey, and John Yoo.
[01:02:18.712 --> 01:02:19.452]  That's correct.
[01:02:19.752 --> 01:02:25.434]  We have to understand, Alex, that they tried to train me to become one of these people.
[01:02:25.474 --> 01:02:27.094]  Don't you have a special Ph.D.?
[01:02:27.114 --> 01:02:28.995]  They only give one a year from Harvard?
[01:02:29.755 --> 01:02:31.056]  Don't you have the Kissinger Ph.D.?
[01:02:31.096 --> 01:02:34.437]  Yeah, I went to the same program that Kissinger did.
[01:02:35.649 --> 01:02:39.933]  At the Center for International Affairs, they gave me Kissinger's old office.
[01:02:40.013 --> 01:02:42.875]  His file cabinets were sitting there when I moved in.
[01:02:43.095 --> 01:02:50.782]  But the point is, we have to understand these neoconservatives, then, are in fact neo-Nazis.
[01:02:51.462 --> 01:02:58.248]  And this is a neo-Nazi mentality that has taken over our government.
[01:02:59.049 --> 01:03:03.793]  And these are the people making these decisions
[01:03:04.433 --> 01:03:06.192]  And that then gets back to why...
[01:03:06.832 --> 01:03:11.896]  They have no problem unleashing an anthrax attack on the American people in Congress.
[01:03:11.976 --> 01:03:13.997]  Indeed, they're anti-democratic.
[01:03:14.117 --> 01:03:32.810]  Professor Boyle, I can go into overdrive on this radio show, but I don't want to keep you... The show's over in one minute, but I want to extend the show for ten minutes, commercial-free, just for the internet streams, but that's hundreds of thousands listening on the internet and tens of thousands later spread out on video.
[01:03:33.111 --> 01:03:36.233]  Can you do ten more minutes right now just so you can finish this statement?
[01:03:37.076 --> 01:03:37.196]  Sure.
[01:03:37.576 --> 01:03:39.017]  Okay, we're going to go into overdrive.
[01:03:39.037 --> 01:03:41.317]  I want to thank the Genesis Network and all the affiliates.
[01:03:41.597 --> 01:03:56.902]  If you go to Infowars.com, only on those audio streams, and PrisonPlanet.tv on the video, we're going to continue with an addendum, not just the anthrax attacks, but who they are, the mindset that allows them to engage in this type of behavior.
[01:03:57.482 --> 01:03:59.463]  And so, again, you need to go to one place.
[01:04:00.183 --> 01:04:01.585]  Do you want to talk to the guest?
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:29.047]  Uh, no, I'm gonna say bye to you, and I am just going to, uh, uh, uh, well, I need to go ahead and... ...them, uh, to engage in this type of behavior.
[01:04:29.627 --> 01:04:37.473]  And so, uh, again, you need to go to one place, InfoWars.com, to click on those streams right now, uh, with Dr. Boyle.
[01:04:37.513 --> 01:04:42.116]  Don't forget my new film, Fabled Enemies, uh, that I produced, that Jason Burmiss has directed.
[01:04:42.136 --> 01:04:45.539]  You can pre-order it now, it comes out in ten days, InfoWars.com.
[01:04:47.415 --> 01:04:50.017]  Dr. Boyle, we're going to call you back in one minute.
[01:04:57.984 --> 01:05:06.870]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:07.971]  Thank you, John.
[01:05:07.991 --> 01:05:09.032]  You can go ahead and disconnect.
[01:05:09.332 --> 01:05:10.112]  Alright, take care.
[01:05:10.233 --> 01:05:16.237]  Yeah, I decided in the last minute to go to extra transmission, so things are a bit bumpy here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:16.857 --> 01:05:18.238]  Not too bumpy, they're just real.
[01:05:18.778 --> 01:05:21.841]  Because I didn't want to cut him off with what he was saying, and that's the great luxury
[01:05:22.461 --> 01:05:26.063]  I mean are we talking to two million people right now on the MNFM 60 plus affiliates?
[01:05:26.143 --> 01:05:26.343]  No.
[01:05:26.703 --> 01:05:28.344]  Are we on the global shortwave and satellite?
[01:05:28.764 --> 01:05:28.964]  No.
[01:05:29.845 --> 01:05:39.890]  But we've got tens of thousands listening on the internet on the streams and a lot of people watching at PrisonPlanet.tv and this will be magnified on the web later when people post it on YouTube and all the other sites.
[01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:45.373]  I would also encourage listeners, there's a lot of other up-and-coming video sites.
[01:05:46.451 --> 01:05:48.753]  Like Justin.tv and a lot of others I've been seeing.
[01:05:49.073 --> 01:05:51.535]  Folks should take these clips and put those up there too.
[01:05:51.595 --> 01:05:52.355]  Not just YouTube.
[01:05:53.596 --> 01:05:56.058]  Because YouTube is starting to censor a lot more.
[01:05:56.519 --> 01:06:01.442]  Though it's the biggest community and it's where you can reach more people and have more viral videos.
[01:06:01.762 --> 01:06:04.144]  Post there and on MySpace videos too.
[01:06:04.164 --> 01:06:06.006]  But then also duplicate it if you have the time.
[01:06:06.406 --> 01:06:13.351]  Put some of these key clips on some of these other big up-and-coming video services that also have millions tuning into them and watching them.
[01:06:13.391 --> 01:06:15.453]  Not hundreds of millions or billions like YouTube.
[01:06:16.658 --> 01:06:20.460]  Hundreds of millions every day, every week, but billions total on YouTube.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:26.963]  So that's still the key areas, but attack in that area and also get into all of the other areas of the web.
[01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:28.283]  We're ready to go to Dr. Boyle.
[01:06:28.964 --> 01:06:32.605]  Okay, Dr. Boyle, I'm only going to keep you for T-minus 10 minutes.
[01:06:32.645 --> 01:06:34.246]  You have the floor completely.
[01:06:34.526 --> 01:06:44.891]  Talk about your PhD with these guys, the mindsets being around them, this cold-blooded divorce from reality, divorce from conscience, this might makes right, survival of the fittest.
[01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:52.614]  This Nazi-type or Malthusian amalgamation that we're facing right now.
[01:06:53.595 --> 01:06:53.755]  Right.
[01:06:53.775 --> 01:07:05.820]  Well, as I was saying, I was trained to be a neoconservative at the University of Chicago by Strauss's co-author and literary executor later, Joseph Cropsey.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.721]  Strauss had just retired when I showed up there.
[01:07:09.261 --> 01:07:14.223]  But I went through the exact same program that produced all these neoconservatives.
[01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:26.158]  And there are two books on them, if you're interested, by Professor Shadia Drury, D-R-U-R-Y, Leo Strauss and the American Right, and The Political Ideas of Leo Strauss.
[01:07:26.618 --> 01:07:39.582]  Professor Drury teaches political philosophy up in Canada, and she, to the best of my knowledge, was never trained at the University of Chicago as I was, but I agree with everything Professor Drury says.
[01:07:40.462 --> 01:07:43.483]  These people are neo-Nazis,
[01:07:44.188 --> 01:07:50.130]  That comes directly from Strauss, who was trained by Schmitt, who was a Nazi.
[01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:56.573]  We still don't know why Schmitt was never prosecuted at Nuremberg or any of the subsequent proceedings.
[01:07:57.213 --> 01:08:00.794]  Influenced by Machiavelli, by Nietzsche, and Hobbes.
[01:08:01.735 --> 01:08:04.776]  Those are the main influences on the neoconservatives.
[01:08:04.856 --> 01:08:10.258]  And then from there I went to Harvard to get my PhD in, and certainly
[01:08:10.723 --> 01:08:14.224]  Don't send your children to the University of Chicago for any reason.
[01:08:14.664 --> 01:08:17.784]  They will simply brainwash them to become neoconservatives.
[01:08:18.424 --> 01:08:28.666]  And then I went to Harvard to get my PhD in political science in the same program that produced Kissinger, Brzezinski, Huntington, and all the rest of these people.
[01:08:30.347 --> 01:08:36.988]  So, again, more of the same type of Machiavellian, Hobbes thought.
[01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:45.876]  Although not as, you know, direct a connection to Schmidt as the University of Chicago was.
[01:08:46.396 --> 01:08:57.225]  So these people are very bright, completely ruthless, unprincipled, and motivated by a Nazi-type philosophy.
[01:08:57.285 --> 01:09:00.007]  There's no other word to describe it, in my opinion.
[01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:06.032]  Continue, sir.
[01:09:06.112 --> 01:09:07.513]  I'm sitting back listening to you.
[01:09:08.652 --> 01:09:19.221]  Well, you know, if you want to get a PhD in political science at Harvard, you have to know your Machiavelli backward, forward, upside down, and in your sleep, and by rote.
[01:09:19.521 --> 01:09:22.163]  So that should give you a pretty good idea.
[01:09:22.543 --> 01:09:28.008]  Kissinger, a Machiavellian to the core, Brzezinski as well.
[01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:40.208]  As I said, people like Wolfowitz, Chalabi, Khalilzad, Shulsky, and the neocons from Chicago, for that you'd have to read Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Nietzsche as well.
[01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:55.622]  And so many of the neoconservatives today, both in the government, in academia, these news media pundits that get quoted
[01:09:56.081 --> 01:09:59.803]  Have all been trained in the same system.
[01:10:00.764 --> 01:10:07.568]  Alan Keyes, a classmate of mine at Harvard, studied with Harvey Mansfield, a Straussian.
[01:10:08.388 --> 01:10:09.989]  I could go on with a list of them.
[01:10:10.069 --> 01:10:13.011]  Fukuyama, another neoconservative.
[01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:24.138]  He wrote a review of Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism for the Sunday New York Times Book Review.
[01:10:24.747 --> 01:10:33.513]  They gave him the entire back page to do this on the 100th anniversary, and he analogized Weber to Carl Schmitt.
[01:10:34.233 --> 01:10:38.956]  And he didn't bother to mention anyone in this review that Schmitt was a Nazi.
[01:10:39.477 --> 01:10:50.924]  Indeed, it apparently did not matter to the New York Times that Fukuyama was referring to Schmitt the Nazi favorably, without identifying as a Nazi.
[01:10:51.519 --> 01:10:56.423]  Because the Sunday New York Times book review editor was a neoconservative himself.
[01:10:57.063 --> 01:11:06.351]  And many of the people there at the New York Times, like Brooks, went through that program at the University of Chicago.
[01:11:06.531 --> 01:11:15.598]  Well, they say... Crystal, who studied on the New York Times, he studied with Harvey Mansfield, the Straussian neoconservative at Harvard.
[01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:20.142]  So it's a very dangerous and incestuous
[01:11:21.775 --> 01:11:37.758]  Bush himself made a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, where he bragged that he had hired, I think it was somewhere between 20 and 25 Straussians in his administration.
[01:11:38.399 --> 01:11:49.661]  So all these people work in accordance with this neo-Nazi philosophy, and so it doesn't surprise me that you would see the anthrax attack
[01:11:50.211 --> 01:11:51.512]  Or anything else they're doing.
[01:11:51.632 --> 01:11:52.813]  They will stop at nothing.
[01:11:53.234 --> 01:11:57.077]  Well, they've said, we have power, we've got to maximize it, we've got to go for everything.
[01:11:57.858 --> 01:12:00.380]  And they totally control McCain.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.502]  Barack Obama's controlled by a lot of the same people.
[01:12:02.822 --> 01:12:04.384]  Do you even see them giving up power?
[01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:07.346]  I don't think they want to, that's right.
[01:12:07.386 --> 01:12:12.411]  I think they want, you know, all the neoconservatives now are working for McCain.
[01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:20.539]  Uh, this Randy Shuneman, his top foreign affairs advisor, was the director of the Project for the New American Century.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:23.783]  I'm sure your listeners know all about PNAC and what they're about.
[01:12:24.705 --> 01:12:28.870]  He was, just until recently, a lobbyist for Georgia.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:34.022]  So they've all congregated around McCain.
[01:12:34.362 --> 01:12:35.382]  Let's briefly talk about that.
[01:12:35.822 --> 01:12:40.064]  Georgia, I mean, is that another manifestation of their arrogance?
[01:12:40.104 --> 01:12:43.845]  And why do we see so many Israelis picking up a Straussian view?
[01:12:43.885 --> 01:12:46.626]  I mean, they just believe in the philosophy of the Nazis.
[01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:51.828]  It's not even a racial thing, is it, per se, Aryan race?
[01:12:51.908 --> 01:12:55.349]  It's the system and the ideals of governing, correct?
[01:12:56.215 --> 01:12:57.155]  I think that's correct.
[01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:11.179]  There was collaboration between the earlier Zionists and the Nazi regime to try to get Jews into Palestine.
[01:13:11.439 --> 01:13:17.040]  Lonnie Brenner has a book on that if you want to read the correspondence itself.
[01:13:18.641 --> 01:13:23.262]  But in any event, yes, to get back to Georgia,
[01:13:24.285 --> 01:13:38.932]  Even today, the Financial Times, the Deputy Defense Minister of Georgia admitted that when they attacked South Ossetia, notice he's incriminating himself here in aggression.
[01:13:39.052 --> 01:13:42.493]  This is in today's Financial Times.
[01:13:42.673 --> 01:13:45.054]  He said, but he didn't believe Russia would respond.
[01:13:46.215 --> 01:13:50.717]  But he's admitting that yes, they unleashed the attack on South Ossetia.
[01:13:50.777 --> 01:13:51.557]  Oh, that's huge news!
[01:13:51.597 --> 01:13:52.357]  I wasn't aware of that.
[01:13:52.397 --> 01:13:53.338]  Give me the name of the story.
[01:13:53.966 --> 01:13:54.307]  All right.
[01:14:09.477 --> 01:14:13.760]  That attack would not have been launched without the approval of the Bush administration.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:15.721]  Well, we also don't just have neocons in NATO.
[01:14:15.761 --> 01:14:24.607]  We have the defense minister being Israeli, not even Georgian, their foreign minister, and the fact that they thought Russia wouldn't respond to a deadly sneak attack.
[01:14:25.387 --> 01:14:27.507]  And then now they're moving more missile systems in.
[01:14:27.567 --> 01:14:32.048]  They've yesterday kicked the ambassadors to NATO of Russia out.
[01:14:32.088 --> 01:14:37.709]  They didn't even do that during World War II and then into the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:41.570]  I mean this is getting to be unprecedented and they're saying Russia will pay.
[01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:48.191]  Cheney made statements about he called the Russian president up and said there will be a response to this and slammed the phone down.
[01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:49.771]  That was in the mainstream news.
[01:14:49.831 --> 01:14:52.752]  I mean it's scary when you get these type of nuts
[01:14:53.212 --> 01:15:11.695]  Now, I know they're very smart and controlled psychopaths, but at the same time, and they've codified it into a political science to give it some type of intellectual cover, they believe, but when you've got Karl Rove walking around saying, we control reality to newspaper writers, and you will just report on the new reality we give you, I mean, we see this psychology.
[01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:13.836]  Do you believe they've gone into megalomania?
[01:15:14.556 --> 01:15:18.757]  Well, this is, you know, consistent with the, you know, these people are sociopaths.
[01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:21.157]  That, you know, that's a regular
[01:15:22.023 --> 01:15:28.847]  Um, uh, position, uh, you know, psychologists, psychiatrists, whatever, they, they function, uh, that way.
[01:15:28.867 --> 01:15:49.440]  Um, but yeah, it's part of the neoconservative, uh, strategy here, uh, to basically resume a Cold War with Russia, uh, as they had against the, uh, Soviet Union, uh, figuring that, you know, the best way to deal with them is, is to destroy them if they can't.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:50.881]  So we've seen the, um,
[01:15:51.831 --> 01:16:07.260]  This promiscuous expansion of NATO right up to the border of Russia, despite the fact that when the Soviet Union collapsed, the Warsaw Pact collapsed, there was no reason at all for NATO to be around.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:14.624]  Indeed, what happened was that the Bush senior administration, instead of dissolving NATO,
[01:16:15.296 --> 01:16:19.918]  The opening shot of this was the war against Serbia, the bombing campaign against Serbia.
[01:16:32.605 --> 01:16:37.486]  Was this to be another snack to give that military system something to do?
[01:16:37.886 --> 01:16:41.007]  And obviously they thought the Russians wouldn't do what they've now done.
[01:16:41.067 --> 01:16:42.668]  Is this a big defeat of the neocons?
[01:16:43.008 --> 01:16:49.089]  And do you think this will generate more anger by them to have an outgoing victory?
[01:16:50.069 --> 01:17:00.212]  Well, I think they knew how the Russians would respond because there were also reports of a large-scale Russian build-up in Russia right over the border.
[01:17:01.199 --> 01:17:04.702]  So they fooled the Georgians and gave them bad intelligence?
[01:17:05.323 --> 01:17:06.724]  Well, they ordered the Georgians in there.
[01:17:06.744 --> 01:17:12.108]  I mean, the Georgian Army is a subsidiary of the Pentagon and the Israeli Ministry of Defense.
[01:17:12.168 --> 01:17:14.630]  We've armed, equipped, supplied, trained these people.
[01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:21.596]  So this is meant to be an opening shalvo in a new cold-slash-hot-brushfire war?
[01:17:22.296 --> 01:17:22.957]  I believe so.
[01:17:23.037 --> 01:17:25.699]  At least a new cold war as they see it.
[01:17:25.859 --> 01:17:29.822]  And then, immediately, they ran through the
[01:17:30.859 --> 01:17:33.420]  Missile agreement with Poland.
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:37.061]  All along they had said, oh well, this has nothing to do with Russia.
[01:17:37.942 --> 01:17:45.905]  But then they capitalized on the vilification of Russia to ram this thing through, and everyone's supporting it.
[01:17:45.985 --> 01:17:54.028]  So it's part of the neocon strategy to resume the Cold War with Russia, and if it risks getting hot, then so be it.
[01:17:54.693 --> 01:17:56.574]  And this leads us into rack and ruin.
[01:17:57.915 --> 01:18:00.256]  We hear the neocons are losing power and stalling.
[01:18:01.337 --> 01:18:03.878]  What other elites are swarming around this New World Order?
[01:18:03.898 --> 01:18:05.279]  Where do you see this going and closing?
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.420]  Well, it doesn't look very good.
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:17.745]  I think they're going to go all out to get McCain elected and continue the neocon agenda for another four to eight years.
[01:18:18.325 --> 01:18:19.546]  I'm a political independent.
[01:18:19.826 --> 01:18:22.988]  I'm not here trying to endorse Obama one way or the other.
[01:18:23.573 --> 01:18:26.494]  Just tell you the situation as I see it.
[01:18:27.274 --> 01:18:38.878]  And if that means provoking this crisis with Russia, and notice McCain has already shot up in the polls and has now come even if not ahead.
[01:18:38.958 --> 01:18:40.458]  We had his advisor a month ago.
[01:18:40.498 --> 01:18:46.440]  We had his advisor a month ago, McCain, saying a new war would help McCain or a new 9-11, and voila!
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:47.760]  That's correct.
[01:18:48.001 --> 01:18:51.542]  And remember, Karl Rove has already said on the 2002 campaign
[01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:57.741]  On the crisis against Iraq, you don't bring out a new product in August.
[01:18:57.902 --> 01:19:16.019]  Well, they did, but it's clear that all this is being orchestrated, in my opinion, very carefully with the McCain campaign, to play to his strong suits as he sees it on defense and foreign affairs.
[01:19:17.296 --> 01:19:26.819]  Obama struggling to keep up, and indeed, on Georgia, Obama has become almost as bad as McCain.
[01:19:26.859 --> 01:19:38.602]  Indeed, his top foreign affairs advisor on Russia is a guy named McFaul from the Hoover Institute out in Palo Alto.
[01:19:39.262 --> 01:19:45.964]  And the Hoover Institute is a well-known haven for neoconservatives and right-wingers.
[01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:55.055]  So, you even have the Russian policies of Obama being determined by one of these people, Brzezinski.
[01:19:55.495 --> 01:20:00.896]  Again, I went to the same PhD program at Harvard that produced Brzezinski.
[01:20:01.796 --> 01:20:06.937]  You know, he's made highly belligerent statements and compared Putin to Hitler.
[01:20:07.017 --> 01:20:12.618]  Yeah, and we've got Brzezinski advising Obama and Brzezinski advising McCain.
[01:20:13.786 --> 01:20:19.970]  Well, again, we have problems also in the Obama camp as well.
[01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:28.195]  There are some, I guess you'd say, people who are more liberal there, but the McCain campaign is fully neoconservative.
[01:20:28.335 --> 01:20:41.043]  We would simply see a continuation and indeed an intensification of the Bush policies that have been a disaster, both at home and abroad.
[01:20:41.847 --> 01:20:49.257]  In a McCain administration, his lawyers are giving him legal advice and running his legal strategy.
[01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:52.261]  They're all the Federalist Society lawyers.
[01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:54.003]  We discussed that before, I believe.
[01:20:54.204 --> 01:20:54.764]  Absolutely.
[01:20:54.804 --> 01:20:55.806]  I've got to have you back up.
[01:20:55.826 --> 01:20:58.669]  I'm going to let you go here in just a moment, but this is the final question.
[01:21:00.511 --> 01:21:09.553]  Looking at all of this, do you think things are going well for them, or going badly for this crop of New World Order managers?
[01:21:09.613 --> 01:21:21.656]  I mean, it seems to me a lot of people are waking up, a lot of people see what's happening, but then you have them making arrogant statements like it's a joke, saying the 21st century nations don't invade other nations, and then even smiling with smart-ass looks.
[01:21:21.696 --> 01:21:25.096]  I mean, is part of their philosophy rubbing it in and being over the top?
[01:21:26.557 --> 01:21:27.997]  Well, I think that
[01:21:28.576 --> 01:21:32.519]  We are seeing some desperation on the part of the neocons.
[01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:35.001]  I don't believe they're out of power or anything like that.
[01:21:35.041 --> 01:21:38.803]  There was some reshuffling, but they're still in power.
[01:21:39.264 --> 01:21:58.057]  But the fact that they are taking steps like the anthrax cover-up, like what they did in Georgia, running over there to Poland and, you know, getting all of Europe upset, in my mind, seems to indicate they are somewhat desperate and concerned about their
[01:21:58.635 --> 01:22:06.484]  Their position, which I think does give the rest of the American people an opening to try to stop them.
[01:22:10.933 --> 01:22:21.058]  The huge police state, the gearing up, the federalizing local departments, the secret camps, all in the news now, the Democrats greedily voting for all those programs, you know, they want that power.
[01:22:22.759 --> 01:22:34.665]  I mean, the real build-up I see against us, when we're servile going along with it all, what is it they're planning that's so horrible that they're gearing up militarily with a huge build-up for domestic suppression?
[01:22:34.725 --> 01:22:37.727]  I mean, is it just implosion of the economy through their greed, or what?
[01:22:38.612 --> 01:22:42.053]  Well, I think that, and also World War III.
[01:22:42.153 --> 01:22:56.255]  I mean, Bush himself, as you know, Putin, last October, flew to Iran, met with Iranian leaders, and said he did not believe Iran was developing nuclear weapons.
[01:22:56.755 --> 01:23:03.817]  Whereupon, President Bush then called a press conference and publicly threatened World War III over Iran.
[01:23:03.877 --> 01:23:04.877]  I think the first time
[01:23:05.325 --> 01:23:10.450]  Certainly in my lifetime where anyone has threatened a World War III president publicly.
[01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:16.435]  Now that threat was not directed at Iran because Iran isn't capable of engaging in a World War III.
[01:23:17.468 --> 01:23:19.229]  It was directed at Russia.
[01:23:19.429 --> 01:23:20.610]  We'll take Mohammed Karzai.
[01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:44.020]  They're in a press conference, and Bush is talking about how Iran is with Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, and of course Karzai knows how bad that plays to all the satellite TV networks, where everyone over there knows the Wahhabis are Sunni, not Iranian Shiites, and that Iran is against the original organic
[01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:45.980]  Al-Qaeda or Al-Qaeda.
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:51.721]  I mean, that was like saying that, you know, Martin Luther King is Adolf Hitler, which is complete opposites.
[01:23:51.981 --> 01:23:54.762]  And he said, excuse me, Mr. President, no, Iran is helping us.
[01:23:55.102 --> 01:23:56.842]  And Bush just said, no, they're not!
[01:23:56.882 --> 01:23:57.922]  They're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:23:58.503 --> 01:24:05.504]  And then, even before the Senate, McCain, a few months ago, the Senator said, you know, isn't it true that Iran's Al-Qaeda?
[01:24:05.524 --> 01:24:06.524]  And he said, yes, that's true.
[01:24:06.564 --> 01:24:09.945]  I mean, it's just, and they always smile when they do it.
[01:24:09.985 --> 01:24:10.825]  It's just such
[01:24:11.705 --> 01:24:16.731]  Such disregard, arrogance, hatred of the public, just wanton lying.
[01:24:17.693 --> 01:24:19.695]  I've studied a lot of history.
[01:24:19.715 --> 01:24:21.077]  I know you have more so.
[01:24:21.517 --> 01:24:25.141]  I've just never seen something this over-the-top and shoddy.
[01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:26.743]  Studying propagandists,
[01:24:27.644 --> 01:24:35.648]  And even Goebbels said it, you know, the propaganda needs to be slick, it doesn't need to be too over-the-top sometimes, or then you get discredited.
[01:24:36.009 --> 01:24:42.612]  It seems like they're going with just a, muddy the waters to the point of people... I mean, it's... there's got to be some method to the madness.
[01:24:42.632 --> 01:24:43.333]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:24:43.353 --> 01:24:53.398]  It's just... Right, well there is, and again, today it was just reported on the wire services that the Aircraft Carrier Task Force under the Reagan
[01:24:54.293 --> 01:24:59.975]  Uh, and it's all its support ships and some others are now moving into place into the Arabian Sea.
[01:25:00.635 --> 01:25:05.436]  Uh, they will be arriving there about the third week in October, which will be right before the election.
[01:25:05.736 --> 01:25:16.799]  So, it does seem to me that, um, there will or very well could be an attack upon Iran, uh, either before the election or, or after the election.
[01:25:17.419 --> 01:25:23.461]  Um, and that very well could, could set off a, a conflict, a direct conflict with
[01:25:23.928 --> 01:25:25.429]  We're good to go.
[01:25:42.558 --> 01:25:50.182]  And risk setting off World War III, which President Bush has publicly stated he is prepared to do with respect to Russia.
[01:25:50.342 --> 01:25:52.263]  God help us, these people are going for broke.
[01:25:52.303 --> 01:25:54.104]  Well, Dr. Boyle, thank you.
[01:25:54.164 --> 01:25:55.265]  Plug the book one more time.
[01:25:55.865 --> 01:26:04.970]  Well, they are going for broke, and we also have to understand then that Senator McCain has said that if there is a World War III, there will be a draft.
[01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.290]  Yes.
[01:26:05.751 --> 01:26:11.874]  So that, I think, is why we're also seeing the police state tactics, that they are going for broke,
[01:26:12.455 --> 01:26:26.447]  And if this does happen, you'll see massive resistance here in the United States of America, certainly to a draft and a collapsing economy, and they're fully prepared to set up their police state.
[01:26:27.387 --> 01:26:28.128]  Well, you said it.
[01:26:28.448 --> 01:26:29.749]  Tell us about the book one more time.
[01:26:29.989 --> 01:26:32.972]  Well, the book is Biowarfare and Terrorism.
[01:26:33.612 --> 01:26:35.734]  I didn't come out here to plug my book.
[01:26:35.794 --> 01:26:40.358]  I came out here to try to explain, and as I see it, I think
[01:26:40.922 --> 01:26:44.044]  You know, the best of my assessment of the situation, what's going on.
[01:26:44.104 --> 01:26:46.745]  Now, I know you didn't come on to plug your book, but we need to get your book out.
[01:26:47.105 --> 01:26:51.627]  People need to read it, and that's why I keep wanting you to plug it, because people need to read that.
[01:26:51.647 --> 01:26:58.430]  And I want to get you back up in the next few weeks, because you're such an expert on all this, and I totally agree with your analysis, sir, and we're just honored to have you.
[01:26:58.451 --> 01:26:59.651]  Thank you so much, Dr. Boyle.
[01:27:00.011 --> 01:27:05.474]  Well, thanks a lot for having me on, and lets everyone out there go out and act upon
[01:27:06.075 --> 01:27:09.358]  The information that they received in the show.
[01:27:09.819 --> 01:27:10.339]  Thank you, sir.
[01:27:10.379 --> 01:27:11.140]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:11.540]  All right.
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:11.821]  Thanks.
[01:27:11.881 --> 01:27:12.121]  Bye.
[01:27:12.261 --> 01:27:12.802]  There he goes.
[01:27:13.022 --> 01:27:13.963]  Bring in Burmese police.
[01:27:16.138 --> 01:27:17.418]  So I want to say bye to Burmese.
[01:27:17.458 --> 01:27:18.099]  I'm about to leave.
[01:27:18.119 --> 01:27:24.781]  I've got a few radio interviews tomorrow and I've got to get ready and geared up to go to the DNC and cover that.
[01:27:25.061 --> 01:27:26.942]  You know, you do an interview like that, it just freaks you out.
[01:27:26.962 --> 01:27:30.323]  I mean, these people are just psychopathic, starting World War III.
[01:27:30.623 --> 01:27:31.504]  They're pure evil.
[01:27:32.324 --> 01:27:34.645]  And I know, they said at Martial Law, I'm on a hit list.
[01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:36.526]  And they're just bastards, man.
[01:27:36.606 --> 01:27:39.707]  I just, I can't believe we have psychopathic demons running things.
[01:27:39.967 --> 01:27:42.788]  And the public's running around fornicating in the streets.
[01:27:44.346 --> 01:27:51.114]  Well, we've got good people like Burmey, and he's going to be here in town tomorrow.
[01:27:51.374 --> 01:27:55.839]  You're doing the Sunday show, and you're doing the show next week when I'm in Denver with live call-ins and the rest of it.
[01:27:55.899 --> 01:28:02.086]  So, Burmey, coming up tomorrow and next week, what do we have to look forward to from you?
[01:28:02.866 --> 01:28:04.468]  We've got Gage, I think, tomorrow.
[01:28:04.508 --> 01:28:06.209]  I think we have Ryan on Monday.
[01:28:06.249 --> 01:28:10.452]  We're also going to be really picking apart this new World Trade Center 7 NIST report.
[01:28:10.512 --> 01:28:17.738]  Obviously, all week at the DNC, we're going to have updates from yourself, Luke Hradowski, and Jonathan from We Are Change Colorado.
[01:28:17.798 --> 01:28:27.165]  And, of course, I'm going to be playing more teasers and trailers of the new film, Fabled Enemies, before its release on September 1st, a little early for the PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers.
[01:28:27.865 --> 01:28:29.869]  August 31st, but I've got a lot to do!
[01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:36.599]  You know, and I just want to take this opportunity to thank you so much Alex for everything you've done for me and allowing me
[01:28:38.328 --> 01:28:39.409]  Hey, Trey just came in.
[01:28:39.449 --> 01:28:40.029]  Let's bring Trey in.
[01:28:40.049 --> 01:28:41.070]  Do you want to get on camera, Trey?
[01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:42.851]  Benjamin Fulford tomorrow.
[01:28:43.191 --> 01:28:47.253]  That's right, Benjamin Fulford of X-Forbes magazine editor.
[01:28:47.353 --> 01:28:49.014]  He's the one that got that Rockefeller interview.
[01:28:49.034 --> 01:28:49.814]  That'll be crazy.
[01:28:49.835 --> 01:28:51.335]  Straight out of Japan.
[01:28:51.415 --> 01:28:52.136]  It should be interesting.
[01:28:52.156 --> 01:28:53.497]  I mean, I'm looking forward to it.
[01:28:53.517 --> 01:28:55.618]  I'm open to other people.
[01:28:55.638 --> 01:29:04.723]  But anyway, I want to just thank you for giving me the opportunity to come out here to make this other 9-11 film that a lot of people said that I didn't want to make or I was trying to cover up.
[01:29:05.363 --> 01:29:08.044]  So, you know, without you, I don't think Fabled Enemies could have been possible.
[01:29:08.064 --> 01:29:10.606]  Well, you've been with the Loose Changes only three years old, the original one.
[01:29:10.626 --> 01:29:12.406]  You've been involved with them two years.
[01:29:12.526 --> 01:29:13.807]  A little bit, like three this summer.
[01:29:13.947 --> 01:29:14.447]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:14.888 --> 01:29:17.289]  Give me the proper time frame.
[01:29:17.309 --> 01:29:18.769]  I think it was three this summer.
[01:29:18.809 --> 01:29:19.690]  I met them in the summer of 2005.
[01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:22.691]  So that's when I started to get involved, basically that week.
[01:29:23.732 --> 01:29:25.372]  And I've been on this roller coaster ever since.
[01:29:25.392 --> 01:29:28.674]  And I've been researching since 2002, about six months after the attack.
[01:29:28.694 --> 01:29:31.115]  The first video you saw was Road to Tyranny, right?
[01:29:31.535 --> 01:29:34.077]  First video that really scared me, you bet.
[01:29:34.578 --> 01:29:48.729]  I'd been researching 9-11 for probably about six weeks to two months, and I just wanted to know more and more, and I come across this guy named Alex Jones, and I find this 77 megabyte real media file, just totally choppy, audio's out of sync by like 20 seconds or whatever.
[01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:55.254]  And me and my roommate sat down and watched it, and I didn't want to do anything more than to prove you wrong on just about anything, and I wasn't able to do it.
[01:29:55.474 --> 01:30:00.698]  I was able to verify your information, and it really led me on this path to find out all the other stuff you talked about.
[01:30:01.018 --> 01:30:02.278]  It's on an extermination list.
[01:30:02.979 --> 01:30:03.299]  Awesome.
[01:30:03.739 --> 01:30:08.340]  Well, I'm willing to have my name on that list because, you know, it's just like I say, if I'm not free and you're not free.
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:12.661]  No, I mean, we have murdering monster terrorists who put poison in vaccines that kill kids.
[01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:13.602]  I've had it, man.
[01:30:13.862 --> 01:30:14.842]  I've had it with you killing.
[01:30:14.862 --> 01:30:16.142]  I'm sick of you, Phil.
[01:30:16.383 --> 01:30:17.523]  We're going to bring you to justice.
[01:30:18.223 --> 01:30:19.864]  And Barmash, you're going to be sitting in this whole week.
[01:30:19.904 --> 01:30:26.788]  We're going to cut now into retransmission from today's show with all those huge guests that we had on.
[01:30:27.969 --> 01:30:32.932]  Great interview with Resistance Manifesto, Mark Dice, we had our InfoWars reporter,
[01:30:34.193 --> 01:30:39.495]  Shane Geiger, who got into the NIST deal and made a stink and got shut down.
[01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:41.255]  From Texas to Maryland, Alex.
[01:30:41.275 --> 01:30:42.536]  And they turned the lights off on him.
[01:30:42.796 --> 01:30:43.516]  So that's coming up.
[01:30:43.556 --> 01:30:50.298]  We're going to cut into a rebroadcast where I was taking phone calls right now, and the Burmese will be back live tomorrow, 11 to 3, and then Sunday 4 to 6.
[01:30:50.858 --> 01:30:52.279]  He is a great guy and we appreciate him.
[01:30:52.699 --> 01:30:53.979]  Pre-order Fabled Enemies now.
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:56.720]  It's going to be shipping in 10 days, the new film.
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:59.041]  And don't forget, it'll be up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:30:59.061 --> 01:31:00.521]  Burmese deserves this film to be big.
[01:31:00.762 --> 01:31:04.463]  It's important and it covers the really dangerous subjects of 9-11.
[01:31:05.123 --> 01:31:06.083]  Thank you for coming in, Burmese.
[01:31:06.103 --> 01:31:06.463]  Thank you.
[01:31:07.244 --> 01:31:08.284]  Alright, here we go to rebroadcast.
