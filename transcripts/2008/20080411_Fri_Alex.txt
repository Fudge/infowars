[00:00:07.622 --> 00:00:10.307]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.395]  A world in which there is a very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:01:02.976]  The question is, will they kill untold millions as they did in the last century?
[00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:06.099]  It is not the elite cockroaches that determine that.
[00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.209]  Yeah.
[00:02:02.568 --> 00:02:04.949]  Often imitated, never duplicated.
[00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:06.729]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:12.831]  We're going to be live here for the next 58 minutes with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:18.272]  And in the next week or so, we've got until we put this on the main Genesis network as I beta test this transmission.
[00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:20.072]  We have no commercials this hour.
[00:02:20.092 --> 00:02:26.134]  We're going to have reduced commercials when the show kicks up in about a week and a half on the main network.
[00:02:27.293 --> 00:02:32.414]  And the good folks at WWCR are carrying this fourth hour as well right now.
[00:02:32.454 --> 00:02:33.975]  We're excited about that.
[00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:43.678]  Let's go ahead and go back to Bob Chapman and directly, of course, back into your phone calls from all over the country and all over the world.
[00:02:44.018 --> 00:02:51.540]  Bob, any other key points that you think need to be added before we go back to the calls?
[00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.960]  No, let's go to the calls.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.700]  Let's go to the calls.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.581]  That's the most important.
[00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:56.421]  Yeah, let's do that.
[00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:58.542]  Let's talk to Rick in New Hampshire.
[00:02:58.622 --> 00:02:59.403]  Rick, you're on the air.
[00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:00.623]  Yeah, hello.
[00:03:01.024 --> 00:03:01.524]  Hello.
[00:03:02.344 --> 00:03:18.813]  Bob, I've often wondered, you've obviously studied this, how did the hyperinflation at the end of the Weimar Republic end, and what was the transition period, and does that have any
[00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:23.299]  Bearing on, maybe, what may happen to us.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.541]  Well, in 1924, they started deflation.
[00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:28.702]  It started a collapse.
[00:03:29.482 --> 00:03:30.763]  It ended in a depression.
[00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:35.405]  And, at that time, there were large groups of people in Germany.
[00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:38.086]  Private armies, if you may, if you can believe that.
[00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:42.408]  And some of them were quite large, and one of them was the Brownshirts.
[00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:48.771]  And, of course, Adolf Hitler got together with them, and the National Socialist Party
[00:03:49.637 --> 00:04:16.965]  uh... ran in elections and uh... were elected in nineteen thirty one and he was appointed uh... appointed chancellor and of course uh... mister shack was uh... running the uh... finances at that time and um... and they put a program together out of the ashes so to speak uh... that began to work for them and of course uh... not only did they try to rebuild the economy uh... but they also try to rebuild for war again and um...
[00:04:18.338 --> 00:04:29.684]  To compare it to today, all of the tenants that were used by the National Socialist Party are in place today in the United States.
[00:04:30.764 --> 00:04:33.685]  And I would expect relatively the same thing to happen.
[00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:40.689]  We'll probably end up with some sort of dictatorial government if we allow the government and the people in the government to do that.
[00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.272]  And maybe the Amaro is phased into the situation too to replace the dollar?
[00:04:48.027 --> 00:04:55.192]  Well, the Amaro is something that they'd like to do, but I think under the circumstances, it's going to be very, very difficult.
[00:04:55.292 --> 00:04:58.274]  And the comparison, of course, is the Euro.
[00:04:58.755 --> 00:05:06.140]  And the Euro has serious problems, irrespective of the fact that it's going up against the dollar, which just happens to have one heck of a lot more problems.
[00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:12.565]  And I even see a good possibility of the Eurozone breaking up.
[00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:16.227]  And that's another story unto itself as to why.
[00:05:16.247 --> 00:05:16.968]  It's pretty simple.
[00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:22.725]  You've got one interest rate for everybody, and it doesn't work.
[00:05:24.145 --> 00:05:27.867]  Well, the government also never let them have votes on it.
[00:05:27.887 --> 00:05:32.330]  When they finally did in Belgium and France and a few other places, 80 plus percent voted against it.
[00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.891]  So the people hate it, and it's breeding revolution.
[00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:38.853]  Yes.
[00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:40.374]  Anything else, Craig?
[00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:48.363]  Or Rick, excuse me.
[00:05:48.403 --> 00:05:51.926]  All the financial problems basically go back to what happened.
[00:05:52.006 --> 00:05:58.371]  I mean, a vast majority of the gold on the planet that used to back currencies or back currencies in America, it's been concentrated.
[00:06:00.372 --> 00:06:06.757]  But basically, once you end up with an unbacked paper currency, you've got vulnerability to all these shenanigans.
[00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:08.038]  Is that basically true?
[00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:09.519]  Absolutely.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.302]  And we don't know if the United States government has any gold.
[00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:18.073]  1954 was the last audit, and Congress refuses to audit it.
[00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:21.954]  So, you know, would they smoke this fire?
[00:06:22.994 --> 00:06:24.335]  Maybe they have some, maybe they don't.
[00:06:24.455 --> 00:06:40.741]  Basically, what we have here is a population that's been flying blind, driving blind for a long time, but now the elite have gotten so delusional on their power trip that in a lot of ways they're flying blind and just hoping that their hubris carries them through it.
[00:06:41.564 --> 00:06:47.810]  But they've stocked it away and they've got survival centers and Bush has got a hundred acre, a hundred thousand acre peregrine ranch and all that.
[00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:48.671]  Oh, no, I agree.
[00:06:48.691 --> 00:06:50.953]  They've built underground bases for themselves and all the rest of it.
[00:06:50.973 --> 00:06:51.674]  I appreciate your call.
[00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:55.298]  We're going to go to Craig in New York and many others in a moment.
[00:06:55.698 --> 00:07:05.308]  But first, Bob, did you hear about the Communist Chinese paramilitary secret police, the death squads that they admit, Associated Press, that do the arresting of political dissidents?
[00:07:05.948 --> 00:07:06.529]  I don't know.
[00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:35.951]  With all these SWAT teams around, pulled out a little Tibetan flag, the Chinese commissars, political police tackled her, then our police grabbed her and slammed her and threw her.
[00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:45.319]  I mean, precedent upon precedent, for foreign troops, you talked about private armies, there's now confirmed BBC reports of
[00:07:45.859 --> 00:07:50.120]  It all goes to show you how valuable and how important those weapons are that you have and you never want to turn them into anybody.
[00:08:15.612 --> 00:08:17.793]  Because are they going to start moving troops over borders?
[00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:18.794]  They obviously are.
[00:08:19.414 --> 00:08:31.900]  I mean, you saw the new quasi-secret agreement that went down between Mexico, the U.S., and Canada recently, and there's been a big hullabaloo about the Canadian-U.S.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.882]  agreement to exchange troops.
[00:08:36.822 --> 00:08:39.263]  And it's really more for U.S.
[00:08:39.283 --> 00:08:43.545]  troops to move into Canada than it is for Canadian troops to come to the United States.
[00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.146]  Exactly, and Mexican here, yeah.
[00:08:46.047 --> 00:09:00.540]  Yeah, but they are continuing to continue to pursue their program, and if we can't beat them at the ballot box, we're going to have to stop.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.741]  There's just no two ways about it.
[00:09:02.801 --> 00:09:06.585]  Well, it's like a bad comic book or a bad science fiction movie.
[00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:13.711]  I mean, these people are nuts, but I guess most leaders throughout history go crazy and want total power and become Napoleonic.
[00:09:15.529 --> 00:09:16.009]  That's true.
[00:09:16.609 --> 00:09:17.489]  Let's take another call.
[00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:18.870]  Let's talk to Craig in New York.
[00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:19.510]  Craig, go ahead.
[00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.951]  Hey, what's up, Alex and Bob?
[00:09:23.051 --> 00:09:25.371]  You guys are true patriots.
[00:09:25.971 --> 00:09:42.735]  I just wanted to ask you what you guys thought since you said, Bob, since you said that the New World Order's factions were split between Europe and America, maybe the Anglo-American powers, on how to go about Iran.
[00:09:43.744 --> 00:10:00.790]  I thought, how likely do you guys think it is that they use Gladio-style groups, Agents Provocateurs, like Baader-Meinhof, like that, RAF, they got this white Al Qaeda now, you know, to provoke, to get Europe involved with going to war with Iran.
[00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:12.415]  Well, you always have these factions, all of which are manufactured by the elitists, and there's not too much we can do about it.
[00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:21.215]  You know, we can talk about it, but you know, we can't act against them because we don't have the cover of authority of the way we're all to do it.
[00:10:21.255 --> 00:10:23.796]  I mean, we're all making a living one way or the other.
[00:10:23.836 --> 00:10:29.819]  We can't trade south to Northern Ireland to ask foreign troops why they're there.
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.061]  And so you have to wait for the evolutionary process to happen.
[00:10:38.184 --> 00:11:02.791]  I'm very concerned about these stories in general, about this white Al Qaeda story and stuff, just because I think here in the states, you know, anti-war activists, all the things that they've said about the 9-11 truth movement, you know, the sound of Wiesenthal Center and such, they're just setting it up, and it's like, I'm very concerned about how do we
[00:11:03.752 --> 00:11:05.553]  Figure it out who these people are.
[00:11:05.893 --> 00:11:07.313]  Well, I mean, I figured it out.
[00:11:07.353 --> 00:11:12.535]  I mean, Bob's right that you will see the evolution of it, but we've already seen so much of their other evolution.
[00:11:12.555 --> 00:11:16.756]  I mean, you worked in counterintelligence, Bob, but just organically studying the New World Order.
[00:11:17.237 --> 00:11:29.441]  They can put out their official story, but then I can find the training manuals, I can see their pre-propaganda, I can see the physical manifestation, I can talk to people, I can go to urban warfare drills, and then I get the documents.
[00:11:30.521 --> 00:11:34.644]  She heads up the Second Amendment Foundation out in California, and remind me guys to get her on.
[00:11:35.084 --> 00:11:49.954]  Bernadine Smith, and Bernadine Smith has, well sent me about ten years ago a phone book, it was bigger than a phone book, a huge binder full of nothing but news articles.
[00:11:50.554 --> 00:11:55.558]  I mean mainstream, the newspaper cutouts, and under State Department 7277,
[00:11:57.921 --> 00:11:59.202]  Signed by Kennedy of all people.
[00:12:00.463 --> 00:12:24.742]  It talks about the disarmament of the American people, how our military will be brought down, how international forces will be brought in, I4, NATO, the rest of it, and it discusses how Chinese troops for four states on the, or five states on the western seaboard, on the eastern seaboard, how they're going to use British, Dutch, French, others, in the south, Czechoslovakian troops,
[00:12:25.582 --> 00:12:25.882]  I don't
[00:12:44.255 --> 00:12:54.457]  In my film, Road to Tyranny, made six years ago, I mean more than, almost seven, it was right, months after 9-11, I had mainstream articles where they sent Mexican-Canadian troops to protect America.
[00:12:54.718 --> 00:12:56.758]  They put Norwegian AWACS in.
[00:12:56.798 --> 00:12:58.879]  They used Mexican troops in New Orleans.
[00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:04.600]  Any excuse to set that precedent, just like they brought Hessians here 240 years ago.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.601]  And so, as crazy as it sounds, they really are intending to do it.
[00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:10.161]  Bob Chapman?
[00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:13.342]  No, I think they are, if they can get away with it.
[00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:16.862]  And, uh, you know, can we stop him before that?
[00:13:17.142 --> 00:13:17.722]  I don't know.
[00:13:17.842 --> 00:13:26.405]  All we can do is keep on getting the word out, because it's the most important thing of all to make more people realize what the situation really is.
[00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:27.906]  Well, I agree.
[00:13:28.126 --> 00:13:29.346]  This is a bold stroke.
[00:13:29.386 --> 00:13:40.890]  I mean, people that will fly remote control planes into buildings, individuals that are that bold and that daring, they're the types that'll use foreign troops or release bioweapons or set off nukes or do anything.
[00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.410]  I mean, Bob,
[00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.751]  I mean, I'm getting that from you, and over the years I've seen your evolution to get even more hardcore.
[00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:48.752]  I mean, with your analysis, your financial background, everything.
[00:13:49.572 --> 00:13:53.253]  I mean, is that a stretch to say we're dealing with people that are almost bored?
[00:13:53.513 --> 00:13:55.193]  They want to do wild, crazy things?
[00:13:56.594 --> 00:13:57.434]  I think that's true.
[00:13:58.454 --> 00:14:02.475]  And, you know, they have this egotistical problem.
[00:14:03.435 --> 00:14:05.176]  That's why they're as arrogant as they are.
[00:14:05.196 --> 00:14:09.817]  Our president is an excellent example of that.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.341]  And I think they can do anything they want, but it's not only him.
[00:14:14.162 --> 00:14:15.362]  It's the whole group of them.
[00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:18.103]  Some are far more sophisticated than others.
[00:14:19.284 --> 00:14:22.466]  And many of them who are up at the top, you never hear about.
[00:14:23.786 --> 00:14:24.827]  But they're pushing.
[00:14:24.847 --> 00:14:25.827]  They want what they want.
[00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:30.269]  Hello?
[00:14:30.289 --> 00:14:31.009]  Yes, sir.
[00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.690]  Anything else?
[00:14:33.162 --> 00:14:47.793]  Yeah, I just wanted to say about the footage of the White Al Qaeda, my stepfather has special forces, army special forces, and he saw those supposed White Al Qaeda and he said to him it looked just like Royal Marines or MI6.
[00:14:48.934 --> 00:14:49.955]  Yeah, but let me stop you.
[00:14:50.396 --> 00:14:52.578]  Your family member is correct.
[00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:54.380]  I went and looked that up.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:06.373]  They were airing a British TV report where they admitted that it was a British military demonstration for a classroom, and if you look, it's a classroom of anti-terror
[00:15:07.214 --> 00:15:34.226]  uh... for anti-terror troops uh... about what terrorists might do so those were anglo-saxons dressed up and and they look look it's the same thing remember the footage of uh... muhammad adah and his number two laughing and giggling at an al-qaeda training meeting a year after that came out we pointed it out and it became one of the biggest stories we ever did at prisonplanet.com and then the media admitted it was true but we uh... listener dug it up and sent us the clip a british
[00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:48.634]  TV show about Guantanamo Bay from 2003 and we found out in 2004 they just recycled like a 1984 where they recycle TV stuff as propaganda later they just took a computer animation
[00:15:49.577 --> 00:15:55.979]  Which was morphed of ADDA, supposedly cutting him in of what it would look like at a meeting with Bin Laden.
[00:15:56.539 --> 00:16:00.340]  And they showed that on a made-for-TV movie and said it was a reenactment.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.661]  But then they released it in the US and said it was a conclusive video of them there.
[00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:08.142]  And then it was never discussed again.
[00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:12.983]  It's kind of like they kill Zarqawi 14 times and would never say, okay, last time we were wrong.
[00:16:13.203 --> 00:16:13.903]  We didn't kill him.
[00:16:13.923 --> 00:16:14.763]  We killed him this time.
[00:16:15.163 --> 00:16:17.004]  And I appreciate your call, Craig.
[00:16:18.124 --> 00:16:22.067]  Bob Chapman, you were in counterintelligence, but now this is behavioral psychologists doing this.
[00:16:22.687 --> 00:16:30.753]  It seems they're practicing outlandish lies on purpose just to where we just kind of... they did study shocking rats in mazes.
[00:16:31.714 --> 00:16:33.976]  And they found... Well, they do that particularly in social issues.
[00:16:34.016 --> 00:16:34.896]  They just give up.
[00:16:34.937 --> 00:16:35.557]  Political issues.
[00:16:35.617 --> 00:16:41.721]  Whereas in Wall Street and within government in relation to finance, they do it 24-7.
[00:16:44.292 --> 00:16:45.173]  It's just incredible.
[00:16:45.193 --> 00:16:47.274]  I mean, the lies just never stop.
[00:16:48.495 --> 00:16:52.778]  You have to spend a lot of time or have a great background in research.
[00:16:53.297 --> 00:16:55.218]  To be able to spot what they're doing quickly.
[00:16:55.698 --> 00:16:57.038]  Because they're very good at it.
[00:16:57.178 --> 00:16:57.999]  But that's my point.
[00:16:58.039 --> 00:16:58.759]  They are doing it.
[00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:09.523]  Is that they're almost making it base and ridiculous and crazy, and then spewing out a fire hose of lies where you can't even... I mean, by the time you're done looking at one lie, it's the next.
[00:17:09.583 --> 00:17:14.564]  And I mean, I think they may start sharing cartoon characters on TV and saying it's Al Qaeda.
[00:17:15.485 --> 00:17:15.705]  Yeah.
[00:17:16.665 --> 00:17:17.625]  Yeah, it's a good example.
[00:17:17.805 --> 00:17:19.966]  Chris and Tam, go ahead.
[00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:21.987]  I reported on Al Qaeda years ago.
[00:17:22.822 --> 00:17:24.744]  And explain what it was.
[00:17:25.304 --> 00:17:27.606]  Well, tell folks from your research what Al-Qaeda is.
[00:17:29.267 --> 00:17:29.547]  What's that?
[00:17:30.128 --> 00:17:32.149]  Tell folks from your research what Al-Qaeda is, Bob.
[00:17:32.169 --> 00:17:39.795]  Oh, it was an operation created by our government.
[00:17:41.056 --> 00:17:42.437]  A boogeyman, so to speak.
[00:17:43.558 --> 00:17:46.180]  And Osama bin Laden was part of it.
[00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:49.303]  He worked for the U.S.
[00:17:49.343 --> 00:17:50.764]  government, was trained by
[00:17:51.377 --> 00:17:51.937]  C.I.A.
[00:17:51.997 --> 00:17:59.220]  people and the Soviet-Afghan situation back in the late 1970s and early 80s.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:15.967]  And, you know, the tip-off was during the mid-80s when people in Washington started talking about this monstrous Al Qaeda that really didn't exist.
[00:18:17.127 --> 00:18:19.288]  That's the evolution of that propaganda.
[00:18:20.546 --> 00:18:30.315]  They were already priming the pump with the new boogeyman and doing little in-cap promotionals introducing you like the old Hollywood studios would introduce a new star.
[00:18:32.637 --> 00:18:41.404]  You know, putting glossies out and press releases and here he is and his family gets all the military, US military and British military bases in the Middle East contracts as their reward.
[00:18:42.225 --> 00:18:43.506]  Now let's go ahead and take a call.
[00:18:43.526 --> 00:18:45.087]  Let's talk to Chris in Tampa.
[00:18:45.107 --> 00:18:45.588]  You're on the air.
[00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.553]  First question, Bob, what would you suggest we do to prepare?
[00:18:50.673 --> 00:19:05.883]  I've been trying to talk to some of my neighbors, those who are receptive, to try to make sure that they could prepare a little bit and maybe not depend on those who have prepared more than them so much when things get a little worse.
[00:19:05.923 --> 00:19:14.249]  So I was thinking also, would you encourage us to keep our money rather than, on paper, roll the coins?
[00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:24.147]  Well, first of all, you want to get rid of that credit card revolving debt and all of those superficial debts that you have other than your home.
[00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:27.149]  It might even try to pay off your vehicles early.
[00:19:27.769 --> 00:19:32.211]  You want to get food, weapons, and gold and silver coins in.
[00:19:32.592 --> 00:19:35.133]  You want to be able to purify water.
[00:19:35.753 --> 00:19:37.214]  These are all very basic things.
[00:19:38.014 --> 00:19:42.457]  And if you have money to invest beyond that, you buy gold and silver related assets.
[00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:45.628]  Yeah, what about the silver shortage?
[00:20:01.798 --> 00:20:04.039]  We have stories from subscribers all over the world.
[00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:10.182]  Well, I know it's real because I've got AP headlines with 12 top silver sellers sold out.
[00:20:10.422 --> 00:20:11.862]  Ted Anderson can't buy it.
[00:20:12.923 --> 00:20:16.724]  I go down to the corner shop here and they're sold out of everything.
[00:20:16.764 --> 00:20:18.045]  I mean, go ahead.
[00:20:18.805 --> 00:20:27.329]  Well, it shows you how the futures market is manipulated under the guidance of the CFTC, the Commodity Futures Traders Corporation.
[00:20:28.044 --> 00:20:33.969]  Which is supposed to oversee and make sure that everything is done legally in those markets.
[00:20:34.009 --> 00:20:38.493]  And of course, they're part of the government, so they allow the manipulation.
[00:20:39.013 --> 00:20:41.855]  But there is not a lot of silver around.
[00:20:42.896 --> 00:20:44.938]  Yes, a lot of coins are being made in Canada.
[00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:51.824]  Yes, there's been a lot of delivery taken of contracts, both large and mini contracts.
[00:20:53.004 --> 00:20:55.947]  And I think a good deal of the
[00:20:56.474 --> 00:21:07.925]  The refineries product, if not all of it, is going to comics and other delivery places in thousand ounce bars to satisfy people who are taking delivery.
[00:21:08.486 --> 00:21:10.908]  I mean, it's a cheaper way, actually.
[00:21:11.709 --> 00:21:16.193]  If you've got the money to do the big bar, that's fine.
[00:21:16.293 --> 00:21:18.736]  But if you don't, they have many contracts.
[00:21:19.674 --> 00:21:23.537]  People are starting to buy the contract and take delivery.
[00:21:23.898 --> 00:21:26.039]  So that's where I think the problem is coming from.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:38.109]  And there's no end to that, because what'll kill the authority that is manipulating the market is that there is no silver around, or there is no gold around.
[00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.932]  And sooner or later, the market has to crack and go upward.
[00:21:42.392 --> 00:21:43.353]  And that's what's going to happen.
[00:21:43.373 --> 00:21:46.095]  I agree.
[00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:49.138]  My second question has to do with
[00:21:49.833 --> 00:21:59.497]  What, as I learned from you, Dick Cheney wrote in PNAC that we need to use our friends in the media to help legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:22:00.217 --> 00:22:13.262]  And this recent media frenzy with Pastor Wright, you know, Barack Obama's ex-pastor, I think that issue is falling into Dick Cheney's plan because
[00:22:14.173 --> 00:22:20.236]  It desensitizes people to even question whether race-specific bioweapons even exist.
[00:22:21.117 --> 00:22:42.568]  And it's also interesting that, of course, Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote in his book, Between Two Ages, the year after Congress authorized the $10 million to fund a synthetic biological agent that describes AIDS, he wrote the year after Congress authorized that funding,
[00:22:43.081 --> 00:22:46.724]  That we would be able to make new diseases.
[00:22:47.044 --> 00:22:53.608]  So perhaps Barack Obama should distance himself from his advisor.
[00:22:53.888 --> 00:22:54.489]  Mentor!
[00:22:57.491 --> 00:22:59.332]  So I wanted to ask your opinion about that, Alex.
[00:22:59.392 --> 00:23:11.140]  Perhaps the media is following Dick Cheney's lead that they legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons by desensitizing us or conditioning us to the idea that they don't even exist.
[00:23:12.918 --> 00:23:23.573]  You know, they've always denied that they existed, even while it's in all the scholarly reports, and Jane's Weapons Quarterly, and AIDS is admitted to have been engineered, and a lot of other things.
[00:23:24.815 --> 00:23:29.441]  But, no, I think that's the old propaganda, while Cheney writes how great it is.
[00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:31.863]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:23:31.923 --> 00:23:39.205]  You see, they had to gear up and make one in ten college graduates be in the Homeland Security apparatus.
[00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:45.627]  They gotta have one in ten being a spy, a tattletale, a torturer, a thug, an assassin.
[00:23:46.787 --> 00:23:54.629]  a data tracker, a surveiller, a spy, a snitch, a scumbag, an anti-american trash because they're going to take everything.
[00:23:54.649 --> 00:24:07.111]  They're going to take a free society down to absolutely nothing and now they have to shift over into the white Al Qaeda and they're everywhere and don't trust your neighbors and by the way political speech is illegal and everything's Al Qaeda.
[00:24:07.451 --> 00:24:10.672]  I mean all over the country cops are going to people's doors and busting in
[00:24:11.132 --> 00:24:12.632]  Without warrants and taking guns.
[00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:13.893]  I have that confirmed.
[00:24:13.933 --> 00:24:15.193]  This is not knock and talk.
[00:24:15.553 --> 00:24:18.354]  This is not in Oakland and New York and Dallas.
[00:24:19.454 --> 00:24:23.895]  They say on the news they're asking to come in, but no, they're demanding and pushing their way in.
[00:24:23.915 --> 00:24:26.156]  And this is under federal grants.
[00:24:26.216 --> 00:24:27.076]  I mean, it's happening.
[00:24:27.096 --> 00:24:29.477]  They didn't triple the size of the BATF.
[00:24:30.097 --> 00:24:34.779]  And do this, the Supreme Court's going to rule that you've got a Second Amendment, but that means they can take your guns.
[00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:36.239]  That's what the Court's already said they're going to do.
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.281]  And then the dumb public's going to think, oh, I have a right to hand them in.
[00:24:39.461 --> 00:24:40.641]  That's my right to own guns.
[00:24:40.841 --> 00:24:42.222]  You know, spin within spin.
[00:24:42.282 --> 00:24:43.082]  Lies within lies.
[00:24:43.402 --> 00:24:44.463]  I mean, it's all happening.
[00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:45.023]  Bob Chapman?
[00:24:46.343 --> 00:24:47.344]  I agree completely.
[00:24:48.524 --> 00:24:55.747]  And I, you know, over the years I've watched the actions of BATF as well as the U.S.
[00:24:55.807 --> 00:24:56.267]  Marshals.
[00:24:57.088 --> 00:24:58.068]  And boy, they certainly
[00:24:59.135 --> 00:25:02.537]  Uh, they are a great deal to be desired.
[00:25:02.557 --> 00:25:06.638]  Their personnel aren't really with it at all.
[00:25:06.658 --> 00:25:09.440]  Well, thanks guys.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.941]  Great job and spend some time with the family.
[00:25:12.486 --> 00:25:13.987]  Well, I appreciate your call, my friend.
[00:25:14.007 --> 00:25:14.687]  Take care.
[00:25:14.987 --> 00:25:15.507]  Take care.
[00:25:15.927 --> 00:25:20.329]  I am so sad that all of this is happening, Bob.
[00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:24.170]  I mean, how do they get cops to go demand to take people's guns?
[00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:28.772]  Don't they know that's totally evil and how Legislative Concord in this country started?
[00:25:30.173 --> 00:25:31.693]  Well, some of them do.
[00:25:32.834 --> 00:25:34.994]  It comes back to dollars and cents.
[00:25:35.855 --> 00:25:37.575]  You argue, you don't get promoted.
[00:25:37.655 --> 00:25:39.796]  You argue, you may lose your job.
[00:25:40.777 --> 00:25:41.697]  And the same thing is
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:26:09.072]  is paramount in any place in the government and if you're an analyst or an economist with a corporation or you know I know of a compliance officer in one of the large brokerage firms offices in the United States complained about the CEO that was leaving receiving so many hundreds of millions of dollars or whatever it was and said the person said it dilutes
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.542]  The ownership that we have in the company and the person was fired.
[00:26:14.262 --> 00:26:27.528]  So it's this intimidation that comes for people who work for other people, whether they're police or people throughout industry or in government in other kinds of jobs.
[00:26:28.349 --> 00:26:32.991]  And so, you know, if you speak out, you know, you might be whistling into the wind.
[00:26:34.051 --> 00:26:35.312]  And so people don't speak out.
[00:26:35.728 --> 00:26:36.989]  Well, it's the same thing with the police.
[00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:40.251]  They say, okay, go out and pick up 15 guns today.
[00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:43.893]  Not everywhere, but in some places they do that.
[00:26:44.854 --> 00:26:49.857]  And, uh, so the policemen say, well, gee, if I don't go and do this, I'm going to get fired.
[00:26:50.678 --> 00:26:51.598]  And so they go and do it.
[00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:58.443]  And, you know, what you were just saying, Alex, about don't they think that this is evil?
[00:26:58.583 --> 00:27:00.364]  I mean, why would they do that?
[00:27:00.504 --> 00:27:02.866]  And one of the programs not too long ago, I said,
[00:27:03.803 --> 00:27:05.724]  That the police are going to have to make a choice.
[00:27:06.824 --> 00:27:15.526]  And they're going to have to do what's good for their family and all of their neighbors, other than the people who are telling them what to do.
[00:27:15.666 --> 00:27:16.987]  And they may lose their job.
[00:27:19.247 --> 00:27:20.788]  But that comes with the territory.
[00:27:21.548 --> 00:27:29.510]  If they refuse and they go along with the program of collecting guns or whatever, then they're going to become a target.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:38.657]  And so, they're kind of in a tough spot either way, but we would like to think that they would all say, no, we're not going to do that.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.321]  And by the way, I take note, I mean, some people get off on talking about blasting cops.
[00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:45.182]  They mean nothing to the New World Order.
[00:27:45.222 --> 00:27:47.422]  It doesn't even hurt the New World Order if cops get blasted.
[00:27:47.682 --> 00:27:50.043]  They'll just bring in the next wave, that is the mercs.
[00:27:50.083 --> 00:27:53.664]  They plan to try this with the regular police and have them chewed up.
[00:27:54.084 --> 00:28:00.706]  And then that will, in the gang mentality, psychologically further compact the police into their own structures.
[00:28:01.306 --> 00:28:10.157]  Yeah, I've learned that, that evil groups want to have their own minions persecuted back because they found in psychology that makes them serve the evil even more.
[00:28:11.318 --> 00:28:16.484]  And I remember in 96 when suddenly Jet Trail stopped disappearing and everybody started talking about it.
[00:28:17.265 --> 00:28:30.930]  And now, in the last two years, I've found all these government and university documents, and now the Department of Energy admits they're modifying the weather, and they've added stuff to jet fuel, and they have thousands of different operations going, and the Earth is 20% darker now.
[00:28:31.711 --> 00:28:34.292]  NASA admits it, and they claim it's to keep us safe from global warming.
[00:28:34.572 --> 00:28:40.994]  When that's an admitted fraud, then there's all this declassified examples where they spray our cities with bacteria, radiation, biologicals.
[00:28:41.034 --> 00:28:42.135]  These are crazy people!
[00:28:42.375 --> 00:28:50.002]  I mean, I'm putting up on screen right now, on the document cam, the photo of them spraying with a huge jumbo jet, and we've always known.
[00:28:50.523 --> 00:28:54.066]  We've always known that that wasn't a condensation ice crystal.
[00:28:54.427 --> 00:28:55.768]  Now they just admit it, Bob!
[00:28:55.788 --> 00:28:57.430]  I mean, we have a secret...
[00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:13.041]  NSA slash National Security Government, in power since 1947, now it's gigantic, runs everything, we got a bunch of nuts, you know, people under the Kabbalah and the occult and all this other stuff running it, and it's like a bad movie!
[00:29:13.081 --> 00:29:14.041]  I mean, do you see what I'm saying?
[00:29:16.283 --> 00:29:18.524]  Well, unfortunately, I was part of it.
[00:29:19.905 --> 00:29:26.510]  And, of course, that was in the early days, only a year after the NSA was formed.
[00:29:27.646 --> 00:29:28.767]  Maybe a year and a half.
[00:29:30.647 --> 00:29:31.408]  But we didn't know.
[00:29:32.428 --> 00:29:35.650]  We didn't know what they were going to be up to, or were up to.
[00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:42.313]  You know, if you reflect back, after the Second World War, the Cold War was contrived.
[00:29:42.393 --> 00:29:43.213]  It was created.
[00:29:44.113 --> 00:29:46.294]  It was to keep the pot boiling, so to speak.
[00:29:47.735 --> 00:29:49.196]  And here we are running all over the world,
[00:29:51.415 --> 00:29:53.337]  I agree.
[00:29:53.457 --> 00:29:57.561]  Let's rampage through calls as quickly as possible.
[00:29:57.602 --> 00:29:59.624]  David in Texas, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:30:01.826 --> 00:30:03.087]  Hello gentlemen, how are you doing?
[00:30:03.127 --> 00:30:03.367]  Good.
[00:30:03.728 --> 00:30:04.388]  Good afternoon.
[00:30:05.916 --> 00:30:12.320]  I was going to briefly say that you've talked earlier this week about possibly Chinese troops being used on the American people.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.561]  No, they have been used.
[00:30:14.901 --> 00:30:15.942]  They were used Wednesday.
[00:30:16.102 --> 00:30:17.223]  We have photos and video.
[00:30:17.243 --> 00:30:26.128]  In fact, I never even played the audio on the show as she begs the black Olympic torch runner, black lady, and the Chinese manhandler, the American cops grab her.
[00:30:26.448 --> 00:30:27.249]  It's all part of the freedom.
[00:30:27.682 --> 00:30:34.104]  Yeah, if they ever try to occupy our country with foreign troops, they might be used for target practice by our people, I'll tell you that.
[00:30:34.504 --> 00:30:40.086]  And the news will say, it's racist, the Chinese troops were raping and killing and burning, and people fought back, how evil.
[00:30:40.106 --> 00:30:46.388]  I mean, have you seen how they've said of Iran, if the globalists attack Iran, they've said in the news, if they fight back, they will be nuked.
[00:30:46.628 --> 00:30:51.809]  They've now said on the news, I'm sure you've seen this, Bob, fighting back is now terrorism, Bob.
[00:30:51.829 --> 00:30:54.690]  Yeah, everything is terrorism.
[00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.251]  This program is, incidentally.
[00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:00.312]  Except them, the real terrorists.
[00:31:00.452 --> 00:31:01.572]  Except them, the real terrorists.
[00:31:01.752 --> 00:31:05.914]  Senate Resolution 1955, which is unconstitutional along with everything else they're doing.
[00:31:05.934 --> 00:31:08.135]  This isn't the first time in American history this has happened.
[00:31:08.335 --> 00:31:09.695]  If I can read really quickly.
[00:31:09.735 --> 00:31:18.098]  Yeah, it happened under, what happened with Lincoln, and then we almost had a second revolution when Washington, just ten years into our founding, when D.C.
[00:31:18.438 --> 00:31:19.098]  tried this before.
[00:31:19.138 --> 00:31:19.478]  Go ahead.
[00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:21.439]  We're also on the Declaration of Independence.
[00:31:21.499 --> 00:31:22.920]  It talks about what happened in colonial times.
[00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:27.586]  The British put troops to harass our people.
[00:31:28.027 --> 00:31:29.467]  They had foreign standing armies.
[00:31:29.607 --> 00:31:32.489]  Eat out our substance, he has elected... Yeah, I've got that, I can read it.
[00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:33.249]  Yeah, read it, read it.
[00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.311]  Okay, complaints they're giving to the British Crown.
[00:31:38.032 --> 00:31:42.294]  He started an administration of justice using extended law for establishing judicial powers.
[00:31:42.754 --> 00:31:45.675]  It may just depend on his will alone, that is the King of England.
[00:31:46.036 --> 00:31:50.898]  For the tenure of their offices and the amount of payment of their salaries, he has erected a multitude of new offices.
[00:31:51.621 --> 00:31:55.744]  New officers and sent the swarms of them to harass our people and eat of our southerns.
[00:31:56.124 --> 00:32:02.309]  He has kept among us in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislature, meaning our kind of Congress.
[00:32:02.709 --> 00:32:20.222]  He is effective to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power, combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction of foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws, given the offense to their acts of pretended legislation for conquering large
[00:32:21.631 --> 00:32:22.411]  Stop right there.
[00:32:22.512 --> 00:32:23.912]  Pretended legislation.
[00:32:24.292 --> 00:32:30.194]  Even if the judges and juries would say something and do something right, the king or his governors would just overrule it.
[00:32:30.414 --> 00:32:31.654]  That's all happening now.
[00:32:31.734 --> 00:32:32.594]  Double jeopardy.
[00:32:33.054 --> 00:32:33.435]  All of it.
[00:32:33.475 --> 00:32:33.795]  Go ahead.
[00:32:33.835 --> 00:32:34.335]  Exactly.
[00:32:34.455 --> 00:32:38.556]  Courting of large bodies of foreign armed troops among other things.
[00:32:38.696 --> 00:32:40.717]  And in another section, not too far beyond, it goes...
[00:32:47.045 --> 00:33:01.652]  He's excited about domestic insurrections amongst us, his endeavor to bring the inhabitants of far frontiers, which is happening with the Mexicans, the illegals now, and merciless... Well, this time I refer to Indians, who are known to rule of warfare, undistinguished destruction of all ages, genders, and conditions.
[00:33:04.334 --> 00:33:09.916]  Large foreign armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the work of death, desolation, and tyranny are already begun on the circumstances of cruelty.
[00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:15.099]  Scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous stages, and totally unworthy of the head of a supposedly civilized nation.
[00:33:15.768 --> 00:33:18.290]  Slight paraphrasing there.
[00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.113]  That's from the Declaration of Independence.
[00:33:21.213 --> 00:33:27.819]  I have a proposal, I have a lot of post-consular moments I've been talking about on some of the Patriot Radio programs lately, that I've managed to call into.
[00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:37.768]  But one of the things, if it comes to it, if Congress totally goes outside the Constitution, there is one final thing we can do short of violent revolution, and that is call for a continental Congress.
[00:33:38.689 --> 00:33:42.232]  That would take the place of the existing Congress and declare it null and void.
[00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:55.780]  What you do is you call for the states to declare members of their own respective state legislatures, which under law are supposed to have... Yeah, New Hampshire has the Article 10 right to revolt, and they've actually tried to pass that.
[00:33:56.761 --> 00:34:04.987]  On 9-11, they had the majority of the cities, the townships, ready to secede, and then the attacks happened and they dropped it.
[00:34:06.668 --> 00:34:16.997]  We'd get our state legislatures to send in replacements for the existing Congress until they can reconvene a new government, hold an election, and get back to the Constitution if it came to that, or at least theoretically try it.
[00:34:17.317 --> 00:34:24.543]  The problem is the majority of the public are talking about what color iPod they're going to have, or how they're going to act stylish, or what new tattoo they're getting.
[00:34:25.004 --> 00:34:27.666]  And I'm not bashing tattoos, I'm just saying that isn't the world.
[00:34:28.306 --> 00:34:31.549]  And meanwhile we've got a whole shadow government spraying us with God knows what.
[00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:33.611]  I mean, it's so far gone!
[00:34:35.034 --> 00:34:36.756]  I mean, it's so insane.
[00:34:36.776 --> 00:34:37.897]  I appreciate your call, David.
[00:34:37.917 --> 00:34:38.457]  Great points.
[00:34:39.298 --> 00:34:40.259]  Excellent.
[00:34:40.339 --> 00:34:41.640]  Mark and Matt, you're on the air.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.241]  Hey, Alex.
[00:34:43.482 --> 00:34:44.302]  Guys, what's up?
[00:34:44.422 --> 00:34:45.163]  Thanks for putting me on.
[00:34:45.443 --> 00:34:48.586]  I just wanted to tell you guys that I met up with Noam Chomsky.
[00:34:50.191 --> 00:34:52.413]  Got a fired up a question to him about 9-11.
[00:34:52.433 --> 00:34:57.258]  And did he say again that he doesn't care even if 9-11 was an inside job?
[00:34:57.338 --> 00:34:57.738]  So what?
[00:34:57.758 --> 00:34:58.379]  It doesn't matter?
[00:34:59.239 --> 00:34:59.860]  More or less, yeah.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.823]  He pretty much pontificated for about six or seven minutes.
[00:35:03.763 --> 00:35:08.047]  And I was able to bring up, during his reply, I was able to bring up the bombing in 93.
[00:35:10.262 --> 00:35:16.783]  He was familiar with that, and yet he didn't bring up any of the circumstances surrounding it to all the people there in Tufts University.
[00:35:17.204 --> 00:35:18.344]  Well, look, he's MIT.
[00:35:18.364 --> 00:35:19.764]  That guy's complete government.
[00:35:20.664 --> 00:35:25.765]  He'll tell the truth about manufacturing consent, how the corporations control everything, and how they're not free market.
[00:35:26.085 --> 00:35:30.406]  But then he says the answer is world government and the UN, when the bankers created that as well.
[00:35:30.646 --> 00:35:32.367]  They use a false left-right paradigm.
[00:35:32.387 --> 00:35:33.007]  He's on the left.
[00:35:33.627 --> 00:35:35.888]  And I destroyed Noam Chomsky in a debate.
[00:35:36.129 --> 00:35:38.150]  There's all these liberals who aren't really that intellectual.
[00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.491]  They just sit around talking about how smart they are.
[00:35:40.691 --> 00:35:42.112]  Have you read Chomsky?
[00:35:42.552 --> 00:35:44.293]  Chomsky's at like a third grade level.
[00:35:44.794 --> 00:35:49.656]  I mean, we're dealing with twilight language, disinfo, communication, triple disinfo.
[00:35:50.117 --> 00:35:51.678]  We're dealing with revelation of the method.
[00:35:51.698 --> 00:35:53.819]  We're dealing with, you know, history and integrated
[00:35:54.379 --> 00:36:01.925]  Information warfare and finance and bio-weapon control and massive ongoing eugenics programs.
[00:36:02.365 --> 00:36:07.549]  I mean, Noam Chomsky is like for people that play at knowing what's going on.
[00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:08.189]  Bob Chapman?
[00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:10.611]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:36:11.852 --> 00:36:15.915]  As a matter of fact, you might even say he's financed by the government.
[00:36:16.275 --> 00:36:16.796]  Well, he is!
[00:36:19.315 --> 00:36:20.256]  He's disgusting.
[00:36:20.276 --> 00:36:21.117]  He makes me sick.
[00:36:21.197 --> 00:36:23.218]  I want to get him back on the show so I can tear him up some more.
[00:36:23.258 --> 00:36:25.460]  He wants to ban guns.
[00:36:26.661 --> 00:36:29.704]  He's promoting a new book, so that would be great if you could get him on the air.
[00:36:30.024 --> 00:36:38.691]  He actually says that a lot of the architects and engineers that have come out don't really have a legitimate leg to stand on, apparently.
[00:36:38.771 --> 00:36:39.732]  But then gives no facts.
[00:36:39.752 --> 00:36:42.635]  Oh, he's put out a book defending the official story.
[00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:46.156]  Well, he actually has a 9-11 book.
[00:36:46.196 --> 00:36:50.198]  I flipped through it briefly, but it was almost like it was postcards or something.
[00:36:50.838 --> 00:36:53.619]  It didn't seem to have any real substance in it.
[00:36:53.679 --> 00:36:57.841]  Look, that old crone, nobody listens to that ninny, and it doesn't matter.
[00:36:57.881 --> 00:36:59.082]  He's weak, he'll be defeated!
[00:36:59.562 --> 00:37:00.742]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[00:37:01.923 --> 00:37:03.944]  Carter in Louisiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:37:04.284 --> 00:37:07.125]  Gentlemen, it is my solemn honor to be able to talk to both of you.
[00:37:07.145 --> 00:37:09.046]  Good job, Rob, Aaron, Alex.
[00:37:09.659 --> 00:37:13.900]  I mean, Bob, excuse me, there are three things that I'd like to address.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:22.081]  First off, do you think it would be a good idea to do a sheriff and police outreach so that we can bring them along to what's going to happen?
[00:37:22.461 --> 00:37:35.164]  And a moment ago, we were talking about what was going to happen in the communities of these people when, in fact, we all know and you may have forgotten that they mail them off, they nationalize them, they send them to other places to commit the stuff.
[00:37:36.657 --> 00:37:50.412]  Most of them are totally freaked out and upset, but they have above them either communists or Christian Zionists who are just real stupid.
[00:37:50.832 --> 00:37:52.214]  They think Israel's God.
[00:37:52.554 --> 00:37:54.717]  They think everybody's about to get nuked any minute.
[00:37:54.817 --> 00:37:55.798]  I've been around these people.
[00:37:56.398 --> 00:38:02.144]  And they just literally, we had to carry out 9-11 because the Muslims are so dangerous.
[00:38:02.204 --> 00:38:05.448]  We had to lose 3,000 to get the people motivated.
[00:38:05.788 --> 00:38:08.351]  But then you start trying to tell them that our government's behind the Muslims.
[00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:12.154]  Then they go, cannot compute, cannot compute, and totally flip out.
[00:38:12.175 --> 00:38:15.938]  They've got also a lot of dumb CENTCOM guys engaging us on the blogs.
[00:38:16.239 --> 00:38:18.301]  But by and large, most people in government
[00:38:18.761 --> 00:38:22.983]  Now I actually don't like what's happening, and that's what may hold back the globalists.
[00:38:23.303 --> 00:38:28.866]  Because Hitler was pretty popular up until about 1942, and then it was too late.
[00:38:29.566 --> 00:38:32.387]  Here, before they even get going, they're very unpopular.
[00:38:32.408 --> 00:38:33.888]  But let's see if Bob agrees with me on that.
[00:38:35.029 --> 00:38:36.329]  No, I agree with you completely.
[00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.690]  Absolutely.
[00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:46.074]  That is the possible seed of what could add to a rebellion, so to speak.
[00:38:46.898 --> 00:38:50.061]  Uh, you know, figuratively rather than physically.
[00:38:50.581 --> 00:38:54.424]  And there are people in the military, uh, who certainly don't agree.
[00:38:54.444 --> 00:38:57.467]  And, uh, what force they could be, I don't know.
[00:38:57.507 --> 00:39:00.970]  But, you know, if we could get something started, maybe we could get it rolling.
[00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.171]  Well, here's an example.
[00:39:03.511 --> 00:39:13.718]  Ron Paul got more than 80% of all, you can pull up the actual numbers, I think it's 86%, but he got over 80% of all, in the primaries, of all of the military money.
[00:39:15.159 --> 00:39:16.920]  And for all the Republicans.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.421]  He got the vast majority.
[00:39:18.661 --> 00:39:20.202]  And he got more than any one Democrat.
[00:39:22.915 --> 00:39:26.237]  You have the troops in two-year-old polls, 70-plus percent against the war.
[00:39:26.317 --> 00:39:29.740]  So, we know that 80 percent plus support Ron Paul.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.100]  What does that tell you?
[00:39:31.401 --> 00:39:32.581]  See, it's a paper tiger.
[00:39:32.662 --> 00:39:33.522]  It's an illusion.
[00:39:35.383 --> 00:39:38.165]  But see, that's why they keep bringing new groups into the military.
[00:39:38.525 --> 00:39:43.189]  They get rid of the 80 percent that say, no, it was the same thing in 29 Palms, they won't fire on Americans.
[00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:48.212]  And they always keep that cadre of 15 to 20 percent, and then they put them in the leadership positions.
[00:39:48.572 --> 00:39:51.154]  And so, they're always kind of like sifting out for gold.
[00:39:51.374 --> 00:39:52.675]  They're sifting for turds.
[00:39:53.595 --> 00:40:00.456]  And so they sift and get all the, you know, the detritus and bring it to their, you know, their breasts and then give them, you know, their dark suckling.
[00:40:01.917 --> 00:40:02.197]  Jim?
[00:40:03.037 --> 00:40:03.737]  I mean, Bob?
[00:40:05.897 --> 00:40:09.238]  Well, I think that that synopsis is really brilliant.
[00:40:10.698 --> 00:40:14.979]  Because I think that, you know, they do disagree.
[00:40:15.699 --> 00:40:16.359]  And they're there.
[00:40:16.679 --> 00:40:17.779]  We just got to motivate them.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.440]  Well, that's why it's important for Alex's movie
[00:40:20.919 --> 00:40:22.641]  Endgame, which is fantastic.
[00:40:23.001 --> 00:40:31.368]  It takes the bristle nest that they've built in people's minds and it cleaves it in half and allows them to see the evil at the core of it.
[00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:41.998]  And back on the Federal Reserve issue, are we going to have any sympathy from foreign governments based on criminal debt like a heroin needle?
[00:40:42.478 --> 00:40:45.821]  We were seduced into taking interest loans
[00:40:46.651 --> 00:40:52.453]  And in time, interest only winds up in everybody being a slave, and there's one guy on top who's the king.
[00:40:52.473 --> 00:40:54.974]  And people want to survive, so they're going to take the loans.
[00:40:54.994 --> 00:41:02.897]  Look, I liken it, Bob knows my analogy, to a three-year-old child that a child molester tricks into getting into their car with candy.
[00:41:03.237 --> 00:41:07.599]  The child was bad, they didn't mind mommy and daddy, they ran to see the puppy or the candy.
[00:41:07.899 --> 00:41:09.500]  But who's really bad?
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.962]  The child who went and was conned, or the bankers that were there with the candy doing it?
[00:41:15.526 --> 00:41:21.411]  Well, let's see in our document that's going around, if that's real or not, the conflict resolution.
[00:41:22.072 --> 00:41:33.541]  The conflict would be as if they cancel the debts, and the revolution would be as if they amp up the taxation and cause revolutionary pressures within this country.
[00:41:33.982 --> 00:41:35.343]  Would foreign governments
[00:41:37.345 --> 00:41:52.939]  The evidence, the breaks, I'd say show 70-30 they'd go with the tyranny because these governments don't have to even get orders to use a terror attack like 9-11 that they all knew was inside job.
[00:41:52.959 --> 00:41:54.740]  You know, the Italian president said we knew day one.
[00:41:55.541 --> 00:41:58.523]  What they do is, they all just use it.
[00:41:58.563 --> 00:42:01.785]  It's like a formula, and then they all copy the formula.
[00:42:01.825 --> 00:42:07.168]  So I see, if they bring us into Nazi Germany, I mean, did the world come running in to save the Germans?
[00:42:07.248 --> 00:42:07.488]  No.
[00:42:07.828 --> 00:42:16.333]  It wasn't until Hitler went wild and went on 18 different directions, that then, and then that was even a bigger thing, because the bankers had actually set him up, Bob.
[00:42:18.214 --> 00:42:19.715]  Well, again, I think you're right.
[00:42:21.627 --> 00:42:23.909]  You know, that, uh, it's a setup.
[00:42:24.249 --> 00:42:25.010]  Anything else, Carter?
[00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:26.171]  No, sir.
[00:42:26.291 --> 00:42:27.191]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:29.813]  Thank God we have people like you on the job.
[00:42:30.054 --> 00:42:43.924]  Well, thank God we got you, Carter, because if we don't spread the word now and tell everybody, I mean, I'm... May I mention, may I mention, I almost helped have a rump convention in the state of Louisiana with regard to the LAGOP and all the deceit and all of the lies we caught the men.
[00:42:43.964 --> 00:42:45.685]  We're talking about the Republicans.
[00:42:45.746 --> 00:42:47.967]  We made them do it in front of our eyes.
[00:42:49.208 --> 00:42:49.528]  Okay?
[00:42:49.848 --> 00:42:56.531]  We had Disinfo people show up in meet-up groups that got us all in a big hubbub and we missed the date.
[00:42:57.011 --> 00:42:59.452]  We got noticed 11 p.m.
[00:42:59.552 --> 00:43:01.553]  the morning, I mean the evening before.
[00:43:01.713 --> 00:43:05.914]  Listen, that's why you get involved in the process and I appreciate your call, Carter.
[00:43:06.314 --> 00:43:06.675]  You bet.
[00:43:07.995 --> 00:43:08.395]  Exactly.
[00:43:08.415 --> 00:43:10.276]  I ought to have you on as a guest.
[00:43:10.776 --> 00:43:12.457]  That's why people say, how do you fight?
[00:43:12.517 --> 00:43:13.417]  How do you fight the New World Order?
[00:43:13.677 --> 00:43:15.778]  If you'll just start fighting, you'll get better at fighting.
[00:43:16.098 --> 00:43:25.041]  If you'll just go to meetings and see the corruption, and see the disinfo, and see the lying, and see how they won't tell you when the delegates are supposed to arrive.
[00:43:25.421 --> 00:43:28.122]  Just get into the guts and you'll find out how corrupt it is.
[00:43:28.382 --> 00:43:31.283]  You know, a lot of a fight is just showing up, isn't it Bob?
[00:43:31.303 --> 00:43:33.463]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:43:33.663 --> 00:43:42.206]  You see what happens with the illegal immigrant community, the impact that they had by just showing up.
[00:43:45.057 --> 00:43:45.597]  Absolutely.
[00:43:45.637 --> 00:43:46.477]  It's just showing up.
[00:43:46.538 --> 00:43:50.319]  I mean, if you're going to lay there and let somebody kick your ass, they're going to beat the hell out of you.
[00:43:50.359 --> 00:43:55.880]  But if you get fired up and start fighting back, I mean, in every case I've been, you might get hurt, but they're going to get hurt too.
[00:43:56.721 --> 00:44:00.122]  And, you know, if you're not the aggressor, nine times out of ten, they're going to back off.
[00:44:00.862 --> 00:44:07.364]  Because they don't have the motivation, you know, as the attacker that you've got as the defender.
[00:44:07.424 --> 00:44:11.466]  I mean, being a defender is actually always a very strong position.
[00:44:11.866 --> 00:44:15.807]  Because, I mean, having the sneak attack is always good, too.
[00:44:16.027 --> 00:44:20.209]  But we know they're coming, and so we're the defender and we know their game plan.
[00:44:20.489 --> 00:44:22.269]  That's a pretty strong position, isn't it, Bob?
[00:44:22.289 --> 00:44:25.270]  They've got to come up the hill towards our machine guns.
[00:44:26.231 --> 00:44:26.951]  Absolutely.
[00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:28.832]  You're absolutely right.
[00:44:30.313 --> 00:44:31.693]  When you're defending your own turf.
[00:44:32.813 --> 00:44:46.976]  And you see what's happening in Iraq or any other country, Afghanistan, in Vietnam, the sacrifices people are willing to make that they might not make if they were in another country other than their own.
[00:44:46.996 --> 00:44:50.116]  I think it's a very, very strong motivation.
[00:44:50.156 --> 00:44:55.357]  Defenders, they take casualties of the enemy of 20 or 30 to 1.
[00:44:57.858 --> 00:44:58.678]  Just like the Alamo.
[00:44:59.893 --> 00:45:00.393]  Exactly.
[00:45:00.674 --> 00:45:01.054]  And again.
[00:45:01.074 --> 00:45:09.100]  And in defenders being crushed, don't think as you see people defeated and killed and in prison with whatever's coming, don't think we're losing.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.280]  Take that as victories.
[00:45:11.421 --> 00:45:19.627]  I mean, take that as, I mean, look, they lost almost every battle, the Founding Fathers against the Redcoats, but it was the fact that they were willing to keep giving fight, Bob.
[00:45:19.647 --> 00:45:21.408]  That's right.
[00:45:21.428 --> 00:45:23.970]  They just came back and back and back and back.
[00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:28.213]  And, you know, the Hessians said to themselves, hey,
[00:45:28.992 --> 00:45:30.093]  These guys are serious.
[00:45:32.074 --> 00:45:32.534]  Absolutely.
[00:45:32.574 --> 00:45:33.294]  Let's take another call.
[00:45:33.314 --> 00:45:35.075]  And most of them stayed here after the war.
[00:45:35.916 --> 00:45:36.336]  Exactly.
[00:45:36.356 --> 00:45:38.077]  They didn't want to go back to Germany and be slaves.
[00:45:38.857 --> 00:45:39.357]  That's right.
[00:45:39.717 --> 00:45:40.658]  Yeah, that's the big secret.
[00:45:40.678 --> 00:45:42.879]  How many slaves there were in Europe and in the U.S.
[00:45:42.959 --> 00:45:45.600]  More indentured slaves who were white than black.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.721]  But that's a big secret, though.
[00:45:46.741 --> 00:45:47.681]  It's in the encyclopedia.
[00:45:48.422 --> 00:45:52.104]  Let's go ahead and talk to Darren in Florida, then Mike, Casey, Abby, Clark, Luke, and Mark.
[00:45:52.384 --> 00:45:53.484]  That'll be it we have for calls.
[00:45:53.504 --> 00:45:54.825]  We've got to move fast for those callers.
[00:45:55.165 --> 00:45:56.406]  Darren in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:45:57.182 --> 00:45:59.044]  Hey guys, thanks for taking my call.
[00:45:59.644 --> 00:46:14.696]  I just wanted to let you guys know, while I was down in Miami, I was talking to a lot of police officers, handing them information, telling them to Google your movie, Endgame, Freedom to Fascism, and some police officers took it.
[00:46:14.936 --> 00:46:21.982]  There were very few that would have nothing to do with it, and there were even a few that said, you know, I know there's something going on.
[00:46:22.586 --> 00:46:25.788]  And I would, you know, challenge them and, you know, talk with them.
[00:46:26.448 --> 00:46:29.769]  And a lot of them were really, really open to the situation.
[00:46:29.789 --> 00:46:30.930]  And I'll tell you this.
[00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:37.613]  Every time I go into a cafe, I hear another person talking about the evidence standing out in 9-11.
[00:46:38.753 --> 00:46:51.523]  And people are really, I really start to see, you know, a lot of stuff going on as I hand people information at the traffic lights, I'm posing questions to them, and I see them thinking a lot harder about it now than ever before.
[00:46:51.563 --> 00:46:57.127]  I think the publicity from Jesse Benshaw is really, really going to make some headway there for us.
[00:46:57.267 --> 00:46:58.188]  Oh, it already has!
[00:46:58.228 --> 00:47:02.770]  That's what people need to go to PrisonPlanet.com, get the archive stories from last week, and spread the word.
[00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:04.291]  In fact, Bob, I wanted to bring that up with you.
[00:47:05.091 --> 00:47:09.653]  Jesse Ventura, Willie Nelson, all these people go in public on this show.
[00:47:10.094 --> 00:47:11.214]  It's accelerating.
[00:47:12.115 --> 00:47:13.415]  I mean, there is a lot of hope.
[00:47:13.676 --> 00:47:19.379]  Take my friend's film, American Drug War, Kevin Booth, that I consulted on, and then I'm in.
[00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:23.140]  It's aired like 50 times on Showtime.
[00:47:23.661 --> 00:47:29.443]  I've heard like three people in the last two weeks on the street who don't even know me talking about, have you seen American Drug War?
[00:47:29.683 --> 00:47:31.344]  Did you know the government brings the drugs in?
[00:47:31.624 --> 00:47:40.489]  And local talk show host Neocons are trying to defend it saying it's all a conspiracy and people call into the show and go, but the CIA Inspector General 10 years ago said it was true.
[00:47:40.829 --> 00:47:45.491]  I mean, it's like all their confidence, I think they've overreached, Bob.
[00:47:46.854 --> 00:47:55.058]  Well, I think they have, too, in all sectors, because their program got blown up on them, and particularly financially.
[00:47:55.238 --> 00:47:57.159]  And this is leading to many other things.
[00:47:58.019 --> 00:48:04.903]  And I think they're in serious, serious trouble in all fronts, even though the bravado and the arrogance is there.
[00:48:05.763 --> 00:48:06.764]  It's not going to carry them.
[00:48:06.784 --> 00:48:13.887]  There's too many people today, because of the Internet, because of programs like yours, Alex, that reach out and tell people what's going on.
[00:48:14.697 --> 00:48:17.759]  It's clicking in, and they're in serious trouble, like you say.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:19.760]  Amazing.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.261]  Thank you so much for the call, sir.
[00:48:21.281 --> 00:48:22.061]  Really great news.
[00:48:22.721 --> 00:48:24.582]  Mike in Illinois, you're on to the air.
[00:48:24.642 --> 00:48:25.703]  Thank you for calling.
[00:48:26.423 --> 00:48:26.923]  Hey, Alex.
[00:48:26.983 --> 00:48:27.484]  How you doing?
[00:48:27.584 --> 00:48:27.844]  Good.
[00:48:28.844 --> 00:48:30.365]  I just want to make a statement.
[00:48:30.965 --> 00:48:34.467]  Actually, I'm really heartbroken in how this nation has geared.
[00:48:34.487 --> 00:48:35.968]  Heartbroken?
[00:48:36.008 --> 00:48:36.949]  We're all in danger.
[00:48:37.389 --> 00:48:38.689]  Yeah, we are in danger.
[00:48:38.729 --> 00:48:40.610]  I mean, this is not just heartbroken.
[00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:41.171]  I agree with you.
[00:48:41.531 --> 00:48:43.372]  I mean, we're in red-level crisis.
[00:48:44.313 --> 00:48:53.083]  I want to encourage everybody, I'm a disabled veteran, I called last week thanking you, but I'm a disabled veteran and I'm very proud of this country.
[00:48:53.203 --> 00:48:56.967]  I'm going to be carrying the civil flag in May every day.
[00:48:57.739 --> 00:49:01.261]  At my college, on my back with my school bag.
[00:49:01.301 --> 00:49:02.421]  I'll be carrying it every day.
[00:49:02.461 --> 00:49:13.026]  So I encourage any students that are listening in to not really so much to start a protest or march, but just carry something that will start and open people's eyes.
[00:49:13.847 --> 00:49:21.790]  I spoke with some of my family who I don't speak with much, but I spoke with them about this subject and they're very aware about everything that we talk about.
[00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:23.011]  So the word is spreading.
[00:49:23.651 --> 00:49:27.333]  And I'm very, very happy that people are opening up their eyes.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.924]  You wake up one more, that's 200 million, game over, we've won.
[00:49:50.324 --> 00:49:51.565]  And the globalists are scared.
[00:49:51.605 --> 00:49:57.032]  I think they may set off a nuke or buy a weapon or start a war any time to try to fail forward.
[00:49:57.072 --> 00:49:57.632]  Bob Chapman?
[00:50:00.616 --> 00:50:03.559]  I just, you know, you covered it again.
[00:50:03.579 --> 00:50:07.143]  It is what it is.
[00:50:10.896 --> 00:50:13.678]  I guess it happens every 50 years, 60 years.
[00:50:13.738 --> 00:50:15.759]  You get thugs and there's always a world war.
[00:50:16.659 --> 00:50:18.060]  You read history, this is the norm.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:25.484]  I just... Now they got new... I think Alex, one thing you can add to this, and this is for the people who don't believe.
[00:50:26.525 --> 00:50:38.412]  If after, for years now, perhaps the last 10 years, more than anything else, you look at what has come out on the internet and through shows like this,
[00:50:39.207 --> 00:50:43.750]  And you've got to believe there is such a thing as the Illuminati, and there is a conspiracy.
[00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:50.253]  It does exist for those people who are in power, and you've got to get that into your head if you're not listening.
[00:50:52.395 --> 00:50:53.235]  Well, exactly.
[00:50:53.255 --> 00:50:58.518]  There's always been secretive elites, and they tricked us that they didn't exist, and that was the devil's greatest trick.
[00:50:59.259 --> 00:51:00.940]  Let's go ahead and talk to Casey in Austin.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.161]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman, The International Forecaster dot com.
[00:51:06.303 --> 00:51:06.623]  Go ahead.
[00:51:10.117 --> 00:51:11.217]  Okay, Casey, you're gone.
[00:51:11.237 --> 00:51:12.018]  Your phone cut out.
[00:51:12.118 --> 00:51:14.158]  Abby in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[00:51:14.839 --> 00:51:22.821]  I just want to say I'm happy to be part of the second American Revolution, and I'm very happy to be informed of what's going on.
[00:51:22.921 --> 00:51:26.223]  Finally, people are starting to wake up in America.
[00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:33.105]  We need to start helping people throughout the world wake up so that when we get down there and we get down in the grudge of things,
[00:51:33.669 --> 00:51:41.293]  There's other people that have to be out there that will fight with us, not just here, but all over the world for freedom, liberty, and justice for everybody.
[00:51:42.433 --> 00:51:43.874]  Well, I heartily agree with you, Abby.
[00:51:43.894 --> 00:51:44.454]  Anything else?
[00:51:47.536 --> 00:51:48.096]  She's gone.
[00:51:48.216 --> 00:51:49.257]  Clark in Arkansas.
[00:51:49.277 --> 00:51:51.938]  You're on the air.
[00:51:51.958 --> 00:51:53.699]  I'm very glad to speak to you today, Alex.
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:55.240]  Nice to talk to you.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.503]  I think that you should do a show fairly soon about the
[00:52:01.781 --> 00:52:16.448]  Well that's all I've ever tried to do is tell people they're all leaders, they all have passion, they all have intelligence, just do something.
[00:52:16.828 --> 00:52:22.431]  People expect that they've got to get up and kick the New World Order's butt by themselves and it's got to be beautiful, it's got to be perfect.
[00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:29.314]  No, I mean it's just putting your weight against them, not laying down, not complying, saying no, saying I'm never giving in,
[00:52:29.614 --> 00:52:32.396]  You cut my arms and legs off, I'm going to be biting you, Bob Chapman.
[00:52:34.778 --> 00:52:37.440]  Well, I don't know how you do those.
[00:52:38.801 --> 00:52:41.644]  You know, make those videos and things like that.
[00:52:41.884 --> 00:52:43.305]  I don't know how you find time to do it.
[00:52:43.365 --> 00:52:44.326]  But it's not just that, Bob.
[00:52:44.366 --> 00:52:48.529]  I mean, how do you find time to write a big, you know, detailed analysis, you know, every couple days?
[00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:50.991]  We both work 18 hours a day, what can I tell you?
[00:52:51.011 --> 00:52:51.652]  But you just do it.
[00:52:51.672 --> 00:52:54.174]  See, Bob does his thing, I do my thing, you do your thing.
[00:52:54.434 --> 00:52:58.858]  We all just do something towards exposing these bastards, and they'll fall.
[00:53:00.666 --> 00:53:02.368]  Clark, anything else?
[00:53:02.608 --> 00:53:03.809]  Yeah, I got a little short list.
[00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:06.212]  First, American Drug War.
[00:53:06.532 --> 00:53:11.717]  It is a necessity as much as owning in-game to watch.
[00:53:11.777 --> 00:53:18.924]  This is a necessary film for people to have in their activist toolkit for people.
[00:53:18.964 --> 00:53:20.986]  This is ridiculously important.
[00:53:21.046 --> 00:53:21.487]  I can't even
[00:53:22.031 --> 00:53:23.352]  You know, fully describe it.
[00:53:23.672 --> 00:53:32.597]  As you said, you know, Philip Castillo is now awaiting a trial, basically because he spoke out so vehemently for years in this film.
[00:53:33.257 --> 00:53:38.119]  And, you know, marijuana is kind of like the 9-11 of drugs.
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:43.522]  Once you look into its legalization or criminalization, it's just so ridiculous, it's sad.
[00:53:44.523 --> 00:53:50.486]  And also, I hope people do a lot of stuff for July 4th and start planning for that as an activist state.
[00:53:51.041 --> 00:54:00.063]  First, I wrote this down, inform yourself and then educate others about the economic terrorism of the Reserve, because I remember, who was it?
[00:54:00.123 --> 00:54:08.044]  Paris on your show that said, people, you've got to inform yourselves when you talk about this, because talking about stuff you don't know about almost is worse for the cause.
[00:54:08.525 --> 00:54:20.067]  People have to understand economics, they have to understand the Federal Reserve's placement and the scope of this situation we're in, and they have to inform others vehemently
[00:54:20.965 --> 00:54:29.068]  In order for them to, uh, you know, if people know, you know, ahead of time, who was, who was going to do 9-11, they would have been able to stop it even more so.
[00:54:29.588 --> 00:54:36.250]  I really think that it would have gone nuclear or something if people like you wouldn't have put out the word that, you know, this stuff does happen.
[00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:48.714]  And, and the only way to keep the economy safe, you know, farmers are farming, businessmen are doing business, but as long as people are starting to hear about the fact that, no, the depression is caused
[00:54:49.204 --> 00:54:51.386]  Inflation is being marked the wrong way.
[00:54:51.847 --> 00:55:08.145]  That is just terribly important to everybody and especially I hope that people work hard over the spring and summer to inform people about that before it gets too late and before too many people can, you know, totally look the wrong way as we go into this inflationary process.
[00:55:08.165 --> 00:55:09.126]  Thank you very much.
[00:55:10.854 --> 00:55:19.846]  Well I agree with you that they were planning a lot of other stuff on 9-11 and for some reason, I don't think it was me on that day, for some reason they didn't go full bore.
[00:55:24.119 --> 00:55:27.560]  It just gets more and more and more and more suspicious.
[00:55:28.661 --> 00:55:31.041]  All the things they're up to, all the things that they're doing.
[00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:37.804]  And I know this, if we hadn't been exposing the paradigm of government-sponsored terror, they would have carried out more attacks by now.
[00:55:37.824 --> 00:55:42.925]  I think we've taken that tool of government-sponsored terror, that mechanism, and broken it right in front of their faces.
[00:55:43.266 --> 00:55:43.806]  Bob Chapman?
[00:55:44.506 --> 00:55:45.586]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:55:45.606 --> 00:55:48.687]  I think that they ran into a brick wall there.
[00:55:49.608 --> 00:55:52.429]  And they're trying to find other avenues, and the avenues
[00:55:54.428 --> 00:55:58.951]  At least as the Bush-Neocon group is concerned, is Iran.
[00:55:59.551 --> 00:56:04.774]  They'd like to get that going to prove that there is, in fact, terrorists everywhere.
[00:56:06.835 --> 00:56:08.275]  And to keep the pot boiling.
[00:56:08.976 --> 00:56:18.821]  And, you know, the very temerity of what they've done in Poland and the Czech Republic, along with the Europeans and the UK, I mean, they're just saying to Russia, we won't have a war with you!
[00:56:19.801 --> 00:56:22.603]  And so, part of that
[00:56:23.699 --> 00:56:30.325]  Aggressiveness is caused by the fact they got stopped at the pass on terrorism.
[00:56:30.585 --> 00:56:31.746]  Nobody believes them anymore.
[00:56:34.469 --> 00:56:37.732]  And so it's an attempt to just basically throw their weight around.
[00:56:39.093 --> 00:56:40.815]  Right, and cover up what they're doing.
[00:56:41.315 --> 00:56:42.776]  You know, they're terrified of this thing.
[00:56:43.237 --> 00:56:46.440]  You know, if they ever get in a position where they gotta go to court, they might get hung.
[00:56:47.486 --> 00:56:57.529]  Well, have you heard like all sorts of big high-level UN people and Parliament people and former presidents in Europe are saying they think it's an inside job and that there needs to be an investigation?
[00:56:58.429 --> 00:57:02.830]  It's really starting to concern them.
[00:57:04.071 --> 00:57:05.651]  Let's go ahead and take a few final calls.
[00:57:05.671 --> 00:57:08.552]  I'm going to let Bob go, who I really appreciate giving us all this time.
[00:57:08.852 --> 00:57:10.853]  Luke in Maston, Mark in Michigan, and that's going to be it.
[00:57:10.893 --> 00:57:11.893]  Luke and Mast, you're on the air.
[00:57:13.047 --> 00:57:26.874]  Alex, I'm kind of worried about my friends down in Texas, because I know the fighting spirit that you guys have, and regarding just your, what would you call it, national pride, for lack of any other term.
[00:57:26.934 --> 00:57:33.938]  So I think that if anybody were to have to take out a part of the country, I think it's going to be you guys.
[00:57:37.342 --> 00:57:41.666]  Well I don't want to say Texans are tough or Texans are unusually tough or something.
[00:57:41.926 --> 00:57:50.735]  I mean a lot of the old Texas thing was it was already the roughest, meanest people that came over to the United States and then the very toughest, meanest people that wanted to fight and
[00:57:51.135 --> 00:57:56.279]  Frankly, they just loved killing and being killed, and loved having wars, and they loved staying at the Alamo and dying.
[00:57:56.299 --> 00:57:57.180]  I mean, they were into it.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.641]  These were some real badasses.
[00:57:58.681 --> 00:58:11.270]  Davy Crockett, all of that, the most cunning, vicious, smart, whatever, greedy, because they wanted land, were the people that were the cutting edge that finally came into Texas, and then they broke the back
[00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:32.271]  By the time Texas was captured, the back of the Indians, because before the natives were beating the whites a lot of the time, and it was huge battles, and Andrew Jackson and the rest of it, but by the time they got Illinois and Texas secured, that was the most vicious fighting, and so Texas was peopled with those folks, but now most Texans
[00:58:33.052 --> 00:58:35.214]  Still like to drink and get in fights and all that stuff.
[00:58:35.294 --> 00:58:43.720]  And I have found, growing up in Dallas, people really, especially the rednecks, I mean we used to go beat each other to pulp on the weekend for fun and people would kill each other.
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:47.944]  I just had a client come in from Texas in our studio in Providence, Rhode Island.
[00:58:48.877 --> 00:58:53.719]  And I mentioned the Trans-Texas Corridor to her, and her face, it was just, I was like, yep, that's a Texan.
[00:58:53.739 --> 00:58:54.999]  You know, I've traveled with a lot of Texans.
[00:58:55.039 --> 00:58:57.540]  Yeah, but I want to be, but I want to say something bad about Texans.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:04.802]  Most Texans now are just, are used to love Bush, they buy into the fake American Americana.
[00:59:05.223 --> 00:59:05.643]  Hey, you know what?
[00:59:05.683 --> 00:59:07.763]  Let's go into emergency overtime.
[00:59:08.284 --> 00:59:13.845]  Let's kill the intro, we'll redrawing transmission, because I, uh, finish up, uh, who am I talking to?
[00:59:13.885 --> 00:59:17.307]  Luke and Mass, and then we'll let Mark finish, and then we'll plug Bob Chapman's newsletter.
[00:59:17.507 --> 00:59:18.107]  Luke, finish up.
[00:59:19.028 --> 00:59:23.089]  Yeah, it was just that I've traveled with Texas in an international group.
[00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:26.231]  As a matter of fact, I actually traveled with the daughter of Will Parish.
[00:59:26.851 --> 00:59:28.231]  I don't know if you're familiar with Will.
[00:59:28.271 --> 00:59:28.692]  Sure.
[00:59:29.092 --> 00:59:29.292]  Yeah.
[00:59:29.992 --> 00:59:38.055]  And so I've kind of got the first-hand experience with the Illuminati, per se, but not much of a threat there, I don't think.
[00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:40.796]  Okay, I appreciate your call.
[00:59:40.876 --> 00:59:42.336]  Mark in Michigan, last caller.
[00:59:42.376 --> 00:59:42.757]  Go ahead.
[00:59:42.777 --> 00:59:43.957]  Hi, Alex.
[00:59:43.977 --> 00:59:45.238]  Hey, thanks for the chance.
[00:59:45.438 --> 00:59:45.718]  You bet.
[00:59:45.738 --> 00:59:46.458]  Thank you for calling.
[00:59:47.475 --> 00:59:48.636]  You're welcome and thank you, Bob.
[00:59:48.656 --> 00:59:49.776]  I appreciate all your work, too.
[00:59:49.836 --> 00:59:53.478]  It's been excellent to listen to you.
[00:59:53.558 --> 00:59:55.700]  Basically, I wanted to talk a little bit about Sully.
[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:03.344]  I heard the interview yesterday, and I hope people will call him and send him money, but I appreciate you helping him out.
[01:00:04.104 --> 01:00:11.508]  What I want to talk about is I don't really think that you're going to find too many police departments where the police are going to wake up.
[01:00:11.568 --> 01:00:14.630]  I think they're all pretty much alert of it and just letting it go on.
[01:00:15.461 --> 01:00:23.487]  I'd like to think that we had some police, but I think the so-called good police have been watching the bad ones get away with it so long, I think they're all co-conspirators.
[01:00:24.948 --> 01:00:32.914]  But I think that's kind of a scary thought, and it goes along with what you were talking about, that they could just pull the plug at any time.
[01:00:33.519 --> 01:00:34.740]  In order to push their agenda.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.723]  Yeah, it's a personal power trip, and as things get even scarier, they feel like, well, at least I'm on the winning team.
[01:00:39.783 --> 01:00:40.384]  I gotta jump.
[01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:41.985]  We just had to let Bob go.
[01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:43.026]  He had to do another interview.
[01:00:43.046 --> 01:00:46.068]  I want to thank Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, for coming on.
[01:00:46.088 --> 01:00:48.709]  I had Christina Ebersole on today.
[01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:54.533]  I aired some clips from my original show on the day of 9-11, talking about anthrax attacks and everything else.
[01:00:55.334 --> 01:00:56.135]  Very good show.
[01:00:56.155 --> 01:01:00.658]  We're going to rejoin that show with Christina Ebersole.
[01:01:01.398 --> 01:01:11.090]  and uh... right now so i just really want to thank all of you for tuning in today i'll be back sunday four to six p m please get the film
[01:01:13.143 --> 01:01:14.144]  American Drug War.
[01:01:14.364 --> 01:01:16.305]  It really needs to be seen.
[01:01:16.365 --> 01:01:17.386]  It's an important film.
[01:01:17.866 --> 01:01:18.466]  And we have it.
[01:01:18.646 --> 01:01:21.308]  It's three hours of extras, two hour film, five hours total.
[01:01:21.388 --> 01:01:22.129]  I consulted on it.
[01:01:22.149 --> 01:01:24.490]  A bunch of my stuff's in the extras and in the film.
[01:01:25.511 --> 01:01:28.913]  And I just hope that you will get American Drug War, The Last White Hope.
[01:01:28.973 --> 01:01:29.893]  It needs to be seen.
[01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:33.396]  People need to understand how it's staged, how the government ships it in.
[01:01:33.716 --> 01:01:35.257]  I mean, what's it say right here on the cover?
[01:01:36.157 --> 01:01:38.579]  It says, we have met the enemy and it is our government.
[01:01:39.199 --> 01:01:47.357]  And the Austin Chronicle said, a movie that features interviews with comedian Tommy Chong, former drug czar and the founder of the Blood Street Gang, is doing something right.
[01:01:47.678 --> 01:01:48.740]  Five years in the making.
[01:01:49.909 --> 01:01:54.852]  Again, if you have PrisonPlanet.tv membership, you can see the video for this extra hour we do, sometimes more.
[01:01:55.072 --> 01:02:02.496]  Then we upload this within two hours of the show ending to PrisonPlanet.tv so you can watch this extra hour when you want, how you want.
[01:02:02.516 --> 01:02:04.657]  I want to thank all the members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:02:04.917 --> 01:02:06.098]  Without you, we couldn't do this.
[01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:08.839]  Okay, sorry to all the other callers, we are just out of time.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.360]  This is the ending now.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.202]  They first shot the hook in here and I threw the hook away from him.
[01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:15.944]  Great job to everybody running the show out there.
[01:02:15.964 --> 01:02:19.366]  I want to thank them for the wonderful job they're doing, and I'll see you back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:02:19.386 --> 01:02:21.648]  Central and back Monday 1 to 3 p.m.
[01:02:21.908 --> 01:02:22.789]  the new Showtime.
[01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:29.473]  We're blasting into the Christina Ebersole interview live, so please stay with us.
[01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:34.437]  That is, we're going live back into retransmission at InfoWars.com.
[01:02:34.697 --> 01:02:35.318]  Love you folks.
[01:02:35.738 --> 01:02:36.218]  Bye-bye.
[01:02:36.539 --> 01:02:38.320]  See you Sunday.
