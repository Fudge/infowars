[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.230]  We're good.
[00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:38.622]  Well, despite all the bad things that are happening around the world and what evil people are up to as they team up together to feed on the rest of us, it's still a beautiful day and life is wonderful and at least we're waking up on a planetary scale to what the globalists are engaged in on a planetary scale.
[00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:41.763]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:41.763 --> 00:00:44.104]  I really do appreciate you tuning in.
[00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:44.684]  It is Wednesday.
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:01:03.366]  It is already, good old Wednesday or Thursday, the 15th day of May 2008 and we're going to be live for the next four hours.
[00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:07.267]  I'm here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:08.447]  until 3 p.m.
[00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:10.368]  Central Standard Time.
[00:01:10.368 --> 00:01:14.150]  We have a really big radio show lined up for you today.
[00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.850]  Jim Tucker
[00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:16.451]  I think so.
[00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:35.482]  The Bilderberg Group really met in Athens, Greece, outside Athens, Greece, in the Mediterranean last weekend.
[00:01:35.482 --> 00:01:37.904]  Or is this Greek newspaper wrong?
[00:01:37.904 --> 00:01:40.767]  Is Bilderberg.org and Tony Gosling wrong?
[00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:47.734]  Tony Gosling's a pretty credible guy, and he seems to think that that was the intel they had before they were going to be meeting in the next few weeks in Greece.
[00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:53.356]  And that indeed that is what has now transpired and happened.
[00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:59.298]  This is a victory for the Bilderberg Group that for 30 plus years has always had their events covered.
[00:01:59.298 --> 00:02:04.679]  Even back when the media denied the group existed more than 10 years ago or so.
[00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.840]  It really upset them and has exposed the shadow government.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.162]  A lot of the leaks and information we get out of the hotel after they leave or while they're there from those that are serving them.
[00:02:14.162 --> 00:02:16.083]  The scraps of paper, the itinerary.
[00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.487]  Things of that nature have given us a lot of key intel for the year ahead, and if this is indeed the case, it's not a good thing.
[00:02:24.487 --> 00:02:29.993]  So we'll find out with Jim Tucker popping in to see if he thinks this has really happened, or if this is another diversion.
[00:02:31.346 --> 00:02:33.088]  Uh, that some folks have bought into.
[00:02:33.088 --> 00:02:39.714]  Uh, we'll be talking again with Jim Tucker coming up in two hours from now.
[00:02:39.714 --> 00:02:45.700]  In the meantime, wide open phones today throughout the first, second, third and fourth hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:56.904]  I was babbling a bit there at the start of the show, stumbling a bit, because I have so much here in front of me.
[00:02:56.904 --> 00:02:59.425]  This is some of the news that is coming up.
[00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:03.445]  Wired Magazine, could soldiers be prosecuted for thought crime?
[00:03:03.445 --> 00:03:08.726]  That's right, they are now announcing that they're making the troops take implantable chips, as we told you years ago they would do.
[00:03:08.726 --> 00:03:12.307]  And now they're announcing that they will have their brain chips.
[00:03:12.307 --> 00:03:15.408]  This, of course, was in declassified military documents in 2000.
[00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:17.408]  Now they're telling the general slave public.
[00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:24.040]  But you'll have access to the latest upgrade of video games like Wii, so, so what?
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.764]  Also, Homeland Security to train cops to combat roadside bombs in the United States, all part of the false hysteria and fear about imaginary terrorists.
[00:03:32.764 --> 00:03:36.806]  The real attacks are carried out by our loving government, which is not our government.
[00:03:36.806 --> 00:03:39.547]  It's a foreign-owned corporation.
[00:03:39.547 --> 00:03:43.309]  Arizona State University tests pandemic flu plans.
[00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:49.339]  Chicago citizens reject terror drill fear-mongering.
[00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:55.163]  Speeders under Florida law face vehicle confiscation five to ten years in prison.
[00:03:55.163 --> 00:03:55.964]  It has passed.
[00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:58.706]  It is now the law.
[00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:09.035]  Don't forget that the private prison industry is lobbying all 50 states to increase laws and penalties to pack all their private prisons.
[00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:11.757]  You thought sending the pot smokers to jail was okay.
[00:04:11.757 --> 00:04:14.439]  Well, they're going to be sending you to jail for speeding, buddy.
[00:04:15.502 --> 00:04:20.323]  And the felons are going to be the jail guards, so enjoy the new America.
[00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:24.764]  Gun owners protest police action despite the fact they were allowed to own guns in the town.
[00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:29.085]  Their guns were confiscated and also these tornadoes that have been happening.
[00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:32.105]  FEMA locks down the cities and confiscates the guns.
[00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:32.766]  That's happening.
[00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:35.306]  See, it's now a regular course of action.
[00:04:35.306 --> 00:04:38.887]  Globalists take a step closer to $200 a barrel of oil.
[00:04:38.887 --> 00:04:39.127]  U.S.
[00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:41.067]  heading towards double-digit inflation.
[00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:44.088]  England in double-digit inflation, Bank of England says.
[00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:47.412]  We will get into Pentagon carpet bombs.
[00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:51.037]  The opposition in cyberspace admits they're engaged in propaganda.
[00:04:51.037 --> 00:04:51.758]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:52.179]  Stay with us.
[00:04:53.772 --> 00:04:54.593]  Hey Emily!
[00:04:54.593 --> 00:04:55.673]  Wow, you look great!
[00:04:55.673 --> 00:04:56.714]  I feel great.
[00:04:56.714 --> 00:04:58.776]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:04:58.776 --> 00:04:59.316]  Really?
[00:04:59.316 --> 00:04:59.956]  What is it?
[00:04:59.956 --> 00:05:00.597]  How does it work?
[00:05:00.597 --> 00:05:07.341]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:09.843]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:15.147]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:05:15.487 --> 00:05:16.268]  That's it?
[00:05:16.268 --> 00:05:18.029]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.949]  It is easy.
[00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:25.934]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:05:25.934 --> 00:05:27.755]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:28.896]  That's amazing!
[00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:34.240]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.081]  Well, how?
[00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:36.482]  Where can I buy a MediCleanse?
[00:05:36.482 --> 00:05:39.404]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.

[00:05:48.793 --> 00:05:49.513]  A new world order.
[00:05:49.513 --> 00:05:50.054]  In the near future.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.241]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:03.241 --> 00:06:06.063]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:06.063 --> 00:06:08.844]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:08.844 --> 00:06:12.045]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:19.348]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:27.835]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:27.835 --> 00:06:31.718]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:31.718 --> 00:06:34.281]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:35.422]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:35.422 --> 00:06:36.222]  They're not after money.
[00:06:36.222 --> 00:06:37.483]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:38.484]  They're after power.
[00:06:38.484 --> 00:06:39.625]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:06:49.123 --> 00:06:51.148]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:51.148 --> 00:06:52.292]  You have been warned.
[00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:55.397]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:06:55.397 --> 00:07:00.759]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.359]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:10.762]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:07:10.762 --> 00:07:16.484]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:18.506]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:07:18.506 --> 00:07:20.689]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:25.215]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:07:25.215 --> 00:07:27.437]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.464]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:13.565]  You know, there's a group called Screw Loose Change that has logos like 101st, Fighting Keyboards, We Eat Chickens for Lunch.
[00:08:13.565 --> 00:08:18.108]  Most of the guys on there admit they are currently in psyops or working for the military.
[00:08:18.108 --> 00:08:26.153]  I don't know if they're openly paid to run their website of disinformation and lies and black propaganda.
[00:08:26.153 --> 00:08:28.214]  By black propaganda, they go out and cover kook 9-11 groups.
[00:08:30.034 --> 00:08:31.957]  Uh, and I mean, that goes back to the 60s.
[00:08:31.957 --> 00:08:42.195]  Uh, you know, they would put somebody on the stand during the garrison trial on JFK, and then one of his star witnesses would suddenly, you know, start acting insane like a chicken on the...
[00:08:43.749 --> 00:09:01.416]  On the stand, and then the media would cover that, so that, you know, they have people running around in Hitler mustaches in front of news cameras screaming 9-11's an inside job, and waving signs saying that 9-11 Truth carried out the bombing of the Military Recruiting Center in New York, and Howard Stern has them on to run around screaming in Hitler mustaches.
[00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.477]  I mean, people see right through what you're doing.
[00:09:03.477 --> 00:09:05.177]  I mean, I want everybody to understand that.
[00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:07.198]  I mean, they don't even hide they're from the military.
[00:09:07.992 --> 00:09:15.345]  And I have all these articles here today where the Pentagon just says, yeah, we're engaging propaganda on the internet, domestically, internationally.
[00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:21.396]  Yeah, we've got private corporations hired and our own troops doing it and CENTCOM's doing it and that's what they're admitting.
[00:09:21.966 --> 00:09:38.864]  And then these guys all have handles, you know, when they come on your message boards and comment pages, and then you can even find the handle they use, and they'll go to their MySpace, and it's them in Iraq, or it's them at CENTCOM, and they say they're in PSYOPS, and they don't even hide it!
[00:09:38.864 --> 00:09:42.067]  I mean, it's just, because to them, they think it's normal.
[00:09:42.688 --> 00:09:43.929]  They think it's good.
[00:09:43.929 --> 00:09:53.276]  They think being in the military and engaging the American people and trying to lie about us and put out disinfo, they think that's normal.
[00:09:53.276 --> 00:09:59.200]  They think that's good, so they don't even... SimCom and the Pentagon doesn't even really have them hide it anymore.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.865]  But there's one of them on here saying, hey, I just got the word I've got to take the chip.
[00:10:04.865 --> 00:10:09.428]  And he goes on to say, it's a little creepy, but you know, they're ordering me to, so I'm going to do it.
[00:10:10.334 --> 00:10:16.120]  And then he posts on one of the pages his papers and why he's getting the chip.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:24.208]  And I don't know enough about it to know that he either knows about the real program and is wanting us to bite on it so he can then say, oh, I'm not really getting it.
[00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:26.751]  It's kind of a black propaganda deal again.
[00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:27.772]  Or probably not.
[00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:31.496]  The way this is phrased, it's like, yeah, I'm getting it, and it's kind of a good thing.
[00:10:32.148 --> 00:10:37.370]  And then the guys are commenting on the page saying, yeah, you know, this is just a conspiracy theory to be against it.
[00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.091]  It's this trackable RFID embeddable chip and your skin's good.
[00:10:41.091 --> 00:11:01.378]  Of course, five and a half years ago when my cousin knocked on the door, he's been in Iraq, Afghanistan three times, Iraq twice, but in between that he is dealing with infrastructure protection and the government and the army keeping us safe here in Austin.
[00:11:02.342 --> 00:11:11.189]  And, uh, but he did say, yeah, we were told that all the officers were going to get chips in two years that are in his, uh, area and they all got their chips.
[00:11:11.189 --> 00:11:13.851]  And, uh, but then you can't talk about it once you get them.
[00:11:13.851 --> 00:11:27.701]  And then now the lower level people are getting their chips and I'm just going off the DARPA report released, uh, on the 7th of January, 2000, where they said next, they would have you take brain chips.
[00:11:28.422 --> 00:11:28.722]  I don't know.
[00:11:44.373 --> 00:11:54.340]  Soldiers will have an amnesic interface that erases their memories, and the troops will be rewarded with drugs, rewarded with pleasure, rewarded with sex simulations.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:01.324]  The public will be, and the pleasure will be so great that you won't be able to refuse it, and so then we'll stop breeding.
[00:12:01.324 --> 00:12:06.428]  That's what the more friendly eugenicists say, that we're all just going to be put in racks.
[00:12:06.428 --> 00:12:09.550]  And they talk about how they're going to phase it in with first promoting the microchip,
[00:12:10.243 --> 00:12:15.406]  Uh, for security, for Alzheimer's, for prisoners, for police, for military, for security.
[00:12:15.406 --> 00:12:20.849]  And then how they would make you have it to have other security jobs, or in power plants, or in nursing homes.
[00:12:20.849 --> 00:12:23.891]  And then, if you want to be in the military, you gotta have it.
[00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:26.352]  And the fighter pilots are the first to get the brain chips.
[00:12:26.352 --> 00:12:29.374]  By the way, they've already got research programs doing that, and that's admitted now.
[00:12:29.704 --> 00:12:32.306]  It's been going on for 20 years and now it's admitted.
[00:12:32.306 --> 00:12:35.748]  And that then you just won't be able to have a job, period, if you don't have it.
[00:12:35.748 --> 00:12:40.331]  And then it will just be put into place and the military says their job.
[00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:45.114]  And by the way, goofballs from CENTCOM listening, I mean, you want to go read it for yourself?
[00:12:45.114 --> 00:12:47.075]  Federation of American Scientists published it.
[00:12:47.075 --> 00:12:49.277]  The military freaked out and said, that's classified.
[00:12:49.277 --> 00:12:53.079]  And the Federation said, you gave this to us for release.
[00:12:53.079 --> 00:12:54.980]  And they said, well, we don't want that out now.
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.841]  But then it was too late.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.744]  Now it's finally eight years later in Wire Magazine today, so we'll cover some of that.
[00:13:01.744 --> 00:13:12.952]  And I mean, I'm not the one saying that the Army's job is going to be inducting the citizenry by 2025 into our racks, into our hive racks where we're going to live.
[00:13:12.952 --> 00:13:14.173]  I'm not the one saying it.
[00:13:14.173 --> 00:13:16.515]  They say this is operational program.
[00:13:17.085 --> 00:13:24.269]  For full dominance, for quote, full protection of the public, we must be put in racks, and then there'll be no terrorism, no crime, no problems.
[00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:28.251]  Now, I know you're not gonna go check it out, sitcom guys.
[00:13:28.251 --> 00:13:35.675]  You're too busy at the bar, and playing baseball, and acting tough, and laughing at us, and hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, you know, doing all the things you do.
[00:13:35.675 --> 00:13:37.977]  Hey Burmess, get in here!
[00:13:37.977 --> 00:13:44.880]  Burmess, we're up here at like midnight last night working, and he finds all this, where they're going, yo, we're getting our chips, and I guess it's good.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.981]  It wasn't on my desk, where is it?
[00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.311]  No, no, it was a giant.
[00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:53.995]  I cleaned off my desk and now... It wasn't on the top.
[00:13:53.995 --> 00:13:56.717]  But I mean, but you got all his paperwork, right?
[00:13:56.717 --> 00:13:59.419]  Because, you know, they got to prove everything on the Randy forums.
[00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:00.640]  There was a link over to that.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.121]  Oh, you got it.
[00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:01.681]  Good job.
[00:14:01.681 --> 00:14:03.363]  I want to talk to you about this like at 1230.
[00:14:03.363 --> 00:14:05.504]  Hey, thank you so much, Burmas.
[00:14:05.504 --> 00:14:11.509]  But I mean, he's got his implantable RFID paperwork here and then the guys all post here.
[00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:12.389]  Well, this is good.
[00:14:14.844 --> 00:14:22.711]  I mean, see, they had the first deny it was all happening, but then once they make them do it and they find out we were telling the truth, they go, okay, well, I'm for it.
[00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:24.492]  See, that's the way a coward operates.
[00:14:24.492 --> 00:14:27.535]  They say, that's not real, that's crazy, that'll never happen.
[00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:30.757]  You know, because I happen to be reading DARPA documents.
[00:14:30.757 --> 00:14:35.782]  And then when it happens, you go, what?
[00:14:35.782 --> 00:14:37.203]  And you can see it in the message board.
[00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:38.849]  Take place.
[00:14:38.849 --> 00:14:43.672]  First, it's kind of creepy, but I guess it's in order, and it's to keep me safe, and then buy five posts down.
[00:14:43.672 --> 00:14:44.412]  Yeah, you're right!
[00:14:44.412 --> 00:14:45.333]  It's great!
[00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:46.013]  It's wonderful!
[00:14:46.013 --> 00:14:46.914]  God, man!
[00:14:46.914 --> 00:14:47.774]  Why didn't I see it?
[00:14:47.774 --> 00:14:50.716]  This is the most fabulous thing since sliced bread!
[00:14:52.955 --> 00:14:59.803]  Just like they're denying there's a North American Union, meanwhile they're on C-SPAN announcing they're already merging the EU with the U.S.
[00:14:59.803 --> 00:15:02.246]  and have already signed the agreement.
[00:15:02.246 --> 00:15:08.793]  We're already in the transatlantic union, publicly, and you can't even get when the president's giving press conferences saying it.
[00:15:10.157 --> 00:15:13.759]  With Merkel and Barroso, it doesn't matter to you, CENTCOM boys.
[00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:32.009]  You're at the Topless Bar there in Florida at night, and having fun with your buds, and your commanders know how to manipulate you, and pat you on the head, and you're all in this little brainwash cult, and you went through eight weeks of brainwashing, and sleep deprivation, and shaved head, all Jim Jones control, and you know it all, and you're the tough guys, and you've got it all figured out.
[00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:36.572]  Meanwhile, I'm reading the military saying you're gonna come and force me into Iraq by 2025.
[00:15:38.365 --> 00:15:42.489]  Yes, wires into my head, put me into a rack.
[00:15:42.489 --> 00:15:48.494]  And that's what all the top futurists say, and the Warwick professor, and the heads of all of it.
[00:15:48.494 --> 00:15:51.996]  And I told the story on local radio today, I'll just tell it again briefly.
[00:15:51.996 --> 00:16:00.784]  I've mentioned it, but I remember being about 10 years old, and my dad, you know, was a local dentist on a dental office, and he comes in, we're having dinner, and he says to my mom, he says, Carol,
[00:16:01.838 --> 00:16:03.420]  There's a secret government program.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:19.760]  You know, I was top of my class and top of my class in dental school, but they're recruiting a lot of area dentists that have, you know, experience with grafting and with implants, you know, new teeth implants and with oral surgery.
[00:16:20.783 --> 00:16:31.888]  And they wouldn't, you know, I'm not allowed to sign on the program to even learn more, but we get a lot more money and we'd move to Maryland and it'd be a secret program.
[00:16:31.888 --> 00:16:40.771]  All they told me is it's huge and I know it must be big because there's a bunch of other dentists here in Dallas who they're recruiting right now for a secret program in cybernetics.
[00:16:40.771 --> 00:16:43.212]  And I was like, what's cybernetics, Dad?
[00:16:43.212 --> 00:16:45.833]  And I was like, I don't know, 10, 11.
[00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:47.814]  The first Terminator just come out and he said, remember
[00:16:48.385 --> 00:16:51.608]  When we were in the hotel a few months ago, I was down in Austin visiting your grandmother.
[00:16:51.608 --> 00:16:52.909]  I still remember this.
[00:16:52.909 --> 00:16:55.812]  And you remember watching that show Terminator that was on HBO?
[00:16:55.812 --> 00:16:57.553]  Well, that's kind of what it's like.
[00:16:57.553 --> 00:17:01.297]  But he said, they won't let me know all those details unless I sign on to the program.
[00:17:01.297 --> 00:17:03.118]  My mom's like, I don't want to leave Texas.
[00:17:03.118 --> 00:17:07.783]  And he's like, well, it's, you know, it's hundreds of thousands of dollars more than I'm making a year now.
[00:17:07.783 --> 00:17:10.025]  And his dental practice was struggling.
[00:17:11.313 --> 00:17:14.617]  The IRS had just taken some of his money and stuff like that was happening.
[00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:21.806]  And I remember them having discussions in the car driving to church about, well, should I join the government program?
[00:17:21.806 --> 00:17:22.547]  That was 24 years ago.
[00:17:22.547 --> 00:17:23.007]  I was 10 or 11.
[00:17:23.007 --> 00:17:23.808]  24, 25 years ago.
[00:17:26.784 --> 00:17:41.589]  Text Mars is of course a professor of space and aeronautics, written government textbooks on robotics, pretty smart guy, and he remembers 30 years ago when he was a professor, guys he knew at UT leaving for secret nanotech programs and cyborg programs.
[00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:42.409]  We've had him on.
[00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:44.830]  See, when you're in academia or a physician,
[00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:50.453]  You'll hear dentists are perfect because they work with bone cartilage interfaces.
[00:17:50.453 --> 00:17:52.574]  And that's why they mainly wanted dentists.
[00:17:52.574 --> 00:17:58.958]  Lord knows what they're doing with the troops, but I'm told from certain sources that it is extremely grisly.
[00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:02.580]  And they've also developed, obviously, humanoid clones.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:11.345]  Yes, folks, in 1998 they admitted they were growing humans in utero of cows that were part cows so they wouldn't have rejection just for organ harvesting.
[00:18:12.273 --> 00:18:20.815]  Again, you don't get women to carry babies, generally, and then let them, you know, take their heart and liver and things out, and body parts, and then sanguinate their juices for different programs.
[00:18:20.815 --> 00:18:22.515]  But this is all going on.
[00:18:22.515 --> 00:18:28.976]  And I'm sorry, my dad did sit at the dinner table, and he did almost go for a human cyborg program with the government.
[00:18:28.976 --> 00:18:29.916]  Okay?
[00:18:29.916 --> 00:18:37.538]  And I mean, to go do this stuff is one of their mad scientist technicians, and they were getting, my dad's, I don't remember the exact number, but he said lots of Dallas Dentists.
[00:18:37.538 --> 00:18:38.298]  The cream of the crop.
[00:18:39.981 --> 00:18:40.922]  Scooping them up.
[00:18:40.922 --> 00:18:44.723]  And imagine every major city just scooping up this dentist.
[00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:47.425]  I mean, a huge project.
[00:18:47.425 --> 00:18:53.127]  Huge project, where you need thousands of dentists.
[00:18:53.127 --> 00:18:54.188]  I mean, I'm guessing at the number.
[00:18:54.188 --> 00:19:01.271]  If he said he had colleagues they approached, and other people in Dallas he knew that were going to do it, and other oral surgeons, I don't know.
[00:19:01.271 --> 00:19:03.832]  But, uh, see, this is the real class.
[00:19:03.832 --> 00:19:05.333]  This is the real government.
[00:19:05.333 --> 00:19:08.134]  Lord knows what's really going on in there.
[00:19:08.996 --> 00:19:11.257]  Who knows what's really happening in there.
[00:19:11.257 --> 00:19:28.081]  And so, see, it's not about sucking your thumb and acting tough and driving your vet around with your Marine Quartets and walking into the base and you got the security clearance and you get on the keyboard and fight American Al-Qaeda Alex Jones, because that nut says they're going to put chips in us.
[00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:30.961]  They're going to put them in your brains, you little dummies.
[00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.662]  And through peer pressure, you're going to do it.
[00:19:32.662 --> 00:19:37.223]  And then they're going to remote control you to run around the streets having your way with us.
[00:19:38.662 --> 00:19:41.385]  I got a bunch of news I'm going to cover first, then your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:41.385 --> 00:19:42.145]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:54.963 --> 00:19:57.645]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:57.645 --> 00:20:07.112]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:07.112 --> 00:20:14.218]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:14.938 --> 00:20:20.924]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:20.924 --> 00:20:32.494]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:32.494 --> 00:20:35.077]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:20:41.042 --> 00:20:43.763]  Or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:20:43.763 --> 00:20:44.083]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.592]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:21:01.592 --> 00:21:04.714]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:21:04.714 --> 00:21:10.459]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:21:10.459 --> 00:21:14.362]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:21:14.702 --> 00:21:19.903]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:22.944]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:21:47.852 --> 00:21:49.994]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[00:21:49.994 --> 00:21:51.775]  Bring down the New World Order.
[00:21:51.775 --> 00:21:53.637]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:21:53.637 --> 00:21:54.397]  Gold.
[00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:55.958]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:55.958 --> 00:21:57.840]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.161]  From the Industrial Age to the Space Age.
[00:22:00.161 --> 00:22:02.223]  Gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:02.223 --> 00:22:06.026]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:06.386 --> 00:22:08.327]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:10.769]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:22:10.769 --> 00:22:18.854]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:22:18.854 --> 00:22:25.998]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's
[00:22:25.998 --> 00:22:26.518]  I think so.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.163]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:57.163 --> 00:23:06.049]  Did you know the syndicated columnist Charlie Reese once wrote a stinging indictment against the internationalists who have captured our federal government for their own purposes?
[00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:11.013]  He reported that the present government of the United States is systematically undoing our independence.
[00:23:11.773 --> 00:23:20.035]  He said that agreeing to belong to the World Trade Organization and taking orders from it was a deliberate sacrifice of our national sovereignty.
[00:23:20.035 --> 00:23:23.777]  He said the United Nations represents the same threat to our sovereignty.
[00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:27.818]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass.
[00:23:28.778 --> 00:23:29.259]  We're good to go.
[00:23:58.985 --> 00:24:08.671]  I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride, with sword and pistol by my side.
[00:24:08.671 --> 00:24:10.772]  Got a big guest joining us next week.
[00:24:10.772 --> 00:24:14.474]  Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade.
[00:24:14.474 --> 00:24:22.459]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[00:24:22.459 --> 00:24:25.420]  The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five.
[00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:34.137]  But I am still alive.
[00:24:34.137 --> 00:24:36.617]  I was a sailor.
[00:24:36.617 --> 00:24:41.518]  I was born upon the tide.
[00:24:41.518 --> 00:24:44.639]  With the sea I did abide.
[00:24:44.639 --> 00:24:45.859]  I sailed a schooner.
[00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:52.141]  I sailed a schooner around the whole New Mexico.
[00:24:52.141 --> 00:24:55.482]  I went aloft and whirled and made so little blow.
[00:24:58.044 --> 00:25:04.488]  You know, I want to get to the news, but it's hard to cut any one of these guys off.
[00:25:27.614 --> 00:25:39.881]  We owe it all to them, the explorers, the trailblazers, the rebels, the renegades, the fighters, the real men, and the strong women that supported them.
[00:25:57.131 --> 00:26:04.277]  I'll fly a starship across the universe divide.
[00:26:04.277 --> 00:26:12.183]  And when I reach the other side, the trailblazers, I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can.
[00:26:12.183 --> 00:26:14.705]  Past, present, and future.
[00:26:14.705 --> 00:26:18.007]  Perhaps I may become a highwayman again.
[00:26:20.546 --> 00:26:23.468]  You only live once, all you sitcom fools.
[00:26:23.468 --> 00:26:27.451]  Deep in your gut, you know you're on the wrong team.
[00:26:43.855 --> 00:26:51.781]  Those Muslim boogeymen, they dangle in front of your eyes all day, and you think you're cutting the rules, breaking the rules, doing all this to protect the U.S.
[00:26:51.781 --> 00:27:12.317]  But look at your bosses, get rid of our dollar, get rid of our sovereignty, get rid of our borders, get rid of our good name, while they fund your little Muslim cullies, go out there and carry out some of the real terror attacks, the low-intensity conflict on the ground level, so you can spook the nation of cowards that we've become here, and going along with your corporate bosses,
[00:27:15.635 --> 00:27:19.466]  I mean, the news I've got here in front of me while I was talking about microchips, soldiers...
[00:27:21.365 --> 00:27:35.277]  ...to be prosecuted for thought crime, and it says, uh, the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is funding a number of technologies that tap into the brain ability to detect threats before the conscious mind is able to process the information.
[00:27:35.277 --> 00:27:43.585]  Already, there's a Pentagon-sponsored work on using the brain pattern-directed capabilities for enhanced goggles and super-fast satellite imagery analysis.
[00:27:43.585 --> 00:27:48.429]  What happens, however, when the Pentagon ultimately uses advanced capability for targeting weapons?
[00:27:49.238 --> 00:28:08.124]  And then it goes on, but if you read the actual report that they're eight years late reporting on, the very reports, they tell you, they tell you the five year, the 10 year, the 20 year strategic plan, and it says that it ends with the government inserting us all into racks in the wall.
[00:28:08.124 --> 00:28:12.805]  And they're already implanting the fighter pilots in the some of the research labs.
[00:28:12.805 --> 00:28:18.347]  This has been confirmed and even leaked out mainstream news with brain chips that hook into the optic nerve
[00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:22.499]  And that's just how it is.
[00:28:22.499 --> 00:28:23.580]  Oh, you want to be an airline pilot?
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.041]  Well, you got to have the enhancement.
[00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:26.923]  And then you're part of that elite class.
[00:28:26.923 --> 00:28:28.564]  Oh, I've got it all.
[00:28:28.564 --> 00:28:32.888]  But for the general public, it's going to be... Again, they've done tests with monkeys.
[00:28:32.888 --> 00:28:34.690]  They've done tests with pigeons.
[00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.391]  They've done tests with rats.
[00:28:36.391 --> 00:28:38.293]  They've done tests with pigs.
[00:28:38.293 --> 00:28:39.714]  They've done tests with horses.
[00:28:40.663 --> 00:29:03.112]  And they put them in stalls, put them in cages, put them in containers, and they have a button that they teach them how to push, they show them how to push, and when they push that button, a implant in their brain, 60 years ago when they first admitted they were doing it, 60 years ago, in the 50s, they would have a wire going into the brain, and it was into the pleasure center, and the
[00:29:04.907 --> 00:29:11.912]  Monkey, the rat, would just sit there punching, punching, punching for three, four days, and then they'd be laying there on their side a week later.
[00:29:11.912 --> 00:29:17.155]  There'd be a huge pool of urine and feces around them, and I'm not trying to be gross here.
[00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:18.136]  I've seen photos of it.
[00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:19.850]  We're on the march.
[00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:21.171]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.121 --> 00:29:55.764]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:42.711 --> 00:30:43.372]  A new world order.
[00:30:43.372 --> 00:30:43.952]  In the near future.
[00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.391]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:03.391 --> 00:31:06.232]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:06.232 --> 00:31:09.012]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:09.012 --> 00:31:12.193]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:12.193 --> 00:31:19.515]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[00:31:53.387 --> 00:31:57.769]  According to the EPA, our indoor air is many times more polluted than outdoor air.
[00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:59.791]  One child in 10 suffers from asthma.
[00:31:59.791 --> 00:32:01.552]  How can we improve the air we breathe?
[00:32:01.552 --> 00:32:02.672]  The answer is clear.
[00:32:02.672 --> 00:32:05.354]  Himalayan Crystal Salt Lamps from Ionic Salts.

[00:33:18.297 --> 00:33:35.105]  Well, I just popped over the old state line My headlights focused on a welcome sign When hiding in the bushes there waiting for me Was a big policeman with a capital P Shouting, look out stranger, you're heading for danger There's a welcome sign ahead
[00:33:36.563 --> 00:33:39.585]  He dragged me off to the old town square.
[00:33:39.585 --> 00:33:42.407]  The justice of the peace are waiting for his share.
[00:33:42.407 --> 00:33:45.469]  He said, lookie here boy, you better slow down.
[00:33:45.469 --> 00:33:48.311]  You're in a heap of trouble in this one horse town.
[00:33:48.311 --> 00:33:51.393]  So look out stranger, you're heading for danger.
[00:33:51.393 --> 00:33:55.095]  There's a welcome sign ahead.
[00:33:55.095 --> 00:33:58.698]  I've got ghosts draggin' off the interstate socket to them J.P.
[00:33:58.698 --> 00:33:58.858]  Blues.
[00:34:01.707 --> 00:34:05.391]  You better pray to me and you better lick my boots!
[00:34:05.391 --> 00:34:09.775]  I'm an officer and you're a lowly civilian!
[00:34:25.169 --> 00:34:25.970]  Go ahead!
[00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:42.719]  A woman gettin' mugged in the heart of town Yells for the cops but there's none around The down on the interstate settin' a trap A huntin' for a live one to skin and wrap So look out stranger, you're headin' for danger There's a welcome sign ahead
[00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:50.245]  When a sign says, welcome to God's country, Lord, you got competition from a slick J.P.
[00:34:50.245 --> 00:34:56.069]  Fuzzy old buzzards are filling their craws, With highway robbery in the name of the law.
[00:34:56.069 --> 00:35:02.715]  So look out, stranger, you're heading for danger, There's a welcome sign ahead.
[00:35:02.715 --> 00:35:06.317]  I've got those drag'em off the interstate, Sock it to them J.P.
[00:35:06.317 --> 00:35:06.478]  blues.
[00:35:09.266 --> 00:35:15.632]  Yeah, welcome in the evening, sock them when they're leaving blues.
[00:35:15.632 --> 00:35:21.017]  A kangaroo court is the last resort on a low-down, shakedown cruise.
[00:35:21.017 --> 00:35:24.320]  Cut them, drag them off the interstate, sock it to them, J.P.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:24.661]  Blue.
[00:35:24.661 --> 00:35:30.646]  Cut them, drag them off the interstate, sock it to them, J.P.
[00:35:30.646 --> 00:35:30.946]  Blue.
[00:35:37.391 --> 00:35:50.996]  Yeah, that's a Dick Curliss remix with a little bit of me on line.
[00:35:50.996 --> 00:35:58.839]  You know, I had heard Dick Curliss when I was a little kid driving along with some of the old country bumpkins I'd be riding along with, taking me to my deer stand when I was a kid.
[00:35:59.948 --> 00:36:09.296]  Uh, and I remember hearing Frank, uh, Dick Curliss and some of the other guys, and boy, I was on YouTube late last night watching, uh, different videos of Dick Curliss.
[00:36:09.296 --> 00:36:13.000]  That is some good country music there, good buddy.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.040]  Isn't that good, buddy?
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.563]  It's got the kind of service you need, all the little extras.
[00:36:17.563 --> 00:36:21.187]  It's got police beating citizens up and throwing people out of wheelchairs.
[00:36:21.187 --> 00:36:23.128]  It's the music video they put together.
[00:36:23.128 --> 00:36:25.050]  I mean, it's so horrible.
[00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:26.251]  And when they threw that
[00:36:27.682 --> 00:36:31.225]  Quadriplegic out of the wheelchair and broke one of his legs for no reason.
[00:36:31.225 --> 00:36:33.787]  They defended it.
[00:36:33.787 --> 00:36:36.889]  You think you're gonna keep being able to sell that to the public?
[00:36:36.889 --> 00:36:43.275]  I mean, you really think that that much of our common sense has been driven from us that we don't understand it?
[00:36:43.275 --> 00:36:56.265]  These poor cops, trained by the system to be power-mad, out-of-control individuals, some of them, and they have no idea that they're in the grasp of a scientific dictatorship that's attacking them every single day and every single way.
[00:36:57.353 --> 00:37:05.619]  Okay, look, I'll just take some calls now at 1-800-259-9231, and then I'm going to run through more of the news, and believe me, it's all crazy.
[00:37:05.619 --> 00:37:07.560]  It is all out of control.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:15.986]  And I'm going to have Burmus pop in here with us in about an hour to talk about our friends over at Loveloosechange.com.
[00:37:15.986 --> 00:37:20.329]  It's actually Screw Loose Change, but anyhow, we're getting our chips, but you know.
[00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.989]  Hoorah!
[00:37:20.989 --> 00:37:24.752]  You guys are traitors!
[00:37:24.752 --> 00:37:25.152]  Oh, man.
[00:37:25.979 --> 00:37:28.341]  But they now say we're crazy not to want our chips.
[00:37:28.341 --> 00:37:29.382]  See?
[00:37:29.382 --> 00:37:31.604]  They didn't exist before, but now we're crazy not to want them.
[00:37:31.604 --> 00:37:32.484]  I mean, who doesn't want one?
[00:37:32.484 --> 00:37:33.645]  It helps our troops.
[00:37:33.645 --> 00:37:37.348]  If you're against the chips, now you're against the troops and against victory.
[00:37:37.348 --> 00:37:39.990]  Burmas, why are you against red, white, and blue?
[00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.991]  Why do you hate America?
[00:37:40.991 --> 00:37:45.095]  Uh, yeah, you hate America.
[00:37:45.095 --> 00:37:51.660]  Hey, did you get up early this morning to... Did you say last night that the crazy no-plainers were definitely on Howard Stern's show?
[00:37:53.849 --> 00:37:56.831]  Last night it was on the Stern's website that the no-plainers were in studio.
[00:37:56.831 --> 00:37:57.972]  Did that happen?
[00:37:57.972 --> 00:37:58.532]  I'm not sure.
[00:37:58.532 --> 00:38:00.573]  I know Paula Gloria was definitely on the bill.
[00:38:00.573 --> 00:38:04.516]  I tried to listen to the replay this morning, but it's a five-hour show, but I'm looking into it.
[00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:05.276]  I'm sure you are.
[00:38:05.276 --> 00:38:06.717]  Yeah, I'll know.
[00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:09.519]  See, it's sick and funny at one level, but it's not at the other.
[00:38:09.519 --> 00:38:11.540]  I'm pretty upset about it.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.921]  I'm not, you know.
[00:38:12.921 --> 00:38:16.703]  The Pentagon's gonna do what they're gonna do, folks, and there's no doubt that crew of people
[00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:37.146]  I mean, it's street acting, running around with Hitler mustaches, attacking people, going, AHHHHH, with news crews that always show up right when they're there, and just doing all sorts of street theater, imitating waterboarding, and saying that, you know, we carried out the attack on the army recruiting facility.
[00:38:37.146 --> 00:38:40.068]  I mean, it's black propaganda!
[00:38:40.068 --> 00:38:43.591]  They're gonna put them all over TV, all over everything else, doing that.
[00:38:44.734 --> 00:38:47.575]  Sick parts of our movement are going to say, well, we need to listen to this.
[00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:48.456]  We need to go along with this.
[00:38:48.456 --> 00:38:49.116]  But it's all an act.
[00:38:49.116 --> 00:38:50.196]  They're not crazy.
[00:38:50.196 --> 00:38:51.717]  They're actually pretty good actors.
[00:38:51.717 --> 00:38:57.379]  And, uh, that's just, I mean, did you think the New World Order wasn't going to try stuff?
[00:38:57.379 --> 00:38:58.720]  Wasn't going to do that?
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.001]  Black propaganda is their favorite.
[00:39:02.001 --> 00:39:04.142]  And I see this as a great victory.
[00:39:04.142 --> 00:39:08.763]  The fact that the Pentagon's putting out reports saying 9-11 truthers worked for Ahmadinejad in Iran.
[00:39:08.763 --> 00:39:12.585]  Uh, and that, uh, I mean, that's just laughable.
[00:39:13.374 --> 00:39:30.739]  That we're putting that out on the payroll of Ahmadinejad, and then conversely, that we believe that cartoon images hit the towers and that no one really saw planes at it, and that it was CG'd into the blue sky.
[00:39:30.739 --> 00:39:37.641]  I mean, that only shows inquiring, intelligent, discerning minds just how real all of this is.
[00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:39.962]  And so, I'm actually quite pleased by it.
[00:39:40.507 --> 00:39:42.848]  Look, Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
[00:39:42.848 --> 00:39:44.909]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[00:39:44.909 --> 00:39:53.254]  All the King's horses and all the King's sitcom propaganda men and all their street actors running around in Hitler mustaches to get attention couldn't put it back together again.
[00:39:53.254 --> 00:39:55.395]  Okay, it's over.
[00:39:55.395 --> 00:39:56.936]  It's been declassified too much.
[00:39:56.936 --> 00:39:59.797]  The government admits they've carried out a bunch of other attacks.
[00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:08.282]  And see, we're not gonna get into space beams and play the game that Bush administration officials who come out for 9-11 truth do to discredit everything.
[00:40:09.315 --> 00:40:12.617]  We're gonna go, hey, did the government stage the attack on the Liberty with Israel?
[00:40:12.617 --> 00:40:13.577]  Yep, declassified.
[00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:15.758]  Did they stage the Gulf of Tonkin attack to get us into Vietnam?
[00:40:15.758 --> 00:40:16.839]  Yep, declassified.
[00:40:16.839 --> 00:40:18.660]  Is Northwoods declassified to stage attacks?
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:19.300]  Yes.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.601]  Did they stage attacks in Iran to overthrow Mosaddegh?
[00:40:21.601 --> 00:40:22.302]  Yes.
[00:40:22.302 --> 00:40:26.844]  Did they stage all these other attacks under Operation Cyclone?
[00:40:26.844 --> 00:40:27.564]  Yes.
[00:40:27.564 --> 00:40:33.307]  Did they stage all these other attacks under the NATO option and under Gladio?
[00:40:33.307 --> 00:40:34.208]  Yes.
[00:40:34.208 --> 00:40:36.249]  Is that admitted in the CIA factbook?
[00:40:36.249 --> 00:40:37.890]  Is that even on the government's website?
[00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:38.130]  Yes.
[00:40:38.906 --> 00:40:39.786]  Okay, done.
[00:40:39.786 --> 00:40:40.707]  Who has the motive?
[00:40:40.707 --> 00:40:43.668]  Did Neocons write memos saying they needed terror attacks?
[00:40:43.668 --> 00:40:52.352]  Did Gary Hart, CFR top strategist for Homeland Security, write a letter to Ahmadinejad saying, we staged the attacks, you better watch it, better do what we say, we'll stage more?
[00:40:52.352 --> 00:40:55.854]  Did we go interview him and did he admit, yes, that's what I said and what I meant?
[00:40:55.854 --> 00:40:56.694]  Yes.
[00:40:56.694 --> 00:40:57.354]  Done.
[00:40:57.354 --> 00:40:59.455]  It's over for you, sitcom.
[00:40:59.455 --> 00:41:02.857]  And I bet you're scared, because a lot of you figured out your masters carried out the attacks,
[00:41:03.664 --> 00:41:09.368]  But in closed-door discussions, it's kind of like, well, we had to do it, you know, it's a military sacrifice.
[00:41:09.368 --> 00:41:16.573]  The Arabs are so dangerous, and to defend America, we had to kill 3,000 to get the resolve of the country up, to quote, quote, fight the greater threat.
[00:41:16.573 --> 00:41:20.636]  You know, that's what, you know, we've now gone to West Point Military Training School.
[00:41:20.636 --> 00:41:29.562]  We learned about necessary pawn sacrifice, and how a commander will put a platoon in, a division in, you know, from 20, 30 people to 10,000 people.
[00:41:33.504 --> 00:41:37.288]  Because, you know, you've got to lure the enemy in and then have a decisive victory.
[00:41:37.288 --> 00:41:40.570]  Because if you didn't do that, you'd end up losing ten times as many men.
[00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:42.712]  And so that's why we did 9-11.
[00:41:42.712 --> 00:41:45.855]  You guys are still traitors and we're going to deal with you.
[00:41:45.855 --> 00:41:47.196]  You're not going to deal with anybody.
[00:41:47.196 --> 00:41:48.016]  You're going to fail.
[00:41:48.016 --> 00:41:48.597]  You understand?
[00:41:50.265 --> 00:41:51.766]  It's disgusting what you did.
[00:41:51.766 --> 00:41:53.588]  It's degenerate what you did.
[00:41:53.588 --> 00:42:03.678]  Even if you were for the United States, and even if this really was to get us to face a real threat, it would be immoral, totally evil, and wicked to do something incredibly evil in the name of good.
[00:42:03.678 --> 00:42:04.879]  By the way, that's their motto.
[00:42:04.879 --> 00:42:07.041]  That's how they sell the youngins to get into it.
[00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:09.884]  Later they find out, no, it's for evil and power's sake.
[00:42:09.884 --> 00:42:11.806]  But it wasn't to defend America.
[00:42:11.806 --> 00:42:14.829]  It wasn't a staged event to meet a real threat, as you were taught.
[00:42:15.643 --> 00:42:23.417]  It was so that the globalists could destroy America and dismantle our freedoms and liberties and sell us off in pieces to the multinational corporations.
[00:42:24.224 --> 00:42:25.504]  That's what happened.
[00:42:25.504 --> 00:42:42.928]  You think you've gotten some high level of knowledge and some dark truth that you're guarding the goodness with great evil and the bodyguard of lies and I'm weak-minded and we just can't face the strength you did and how you planted those bombs and how you did it as team members for America.
[00:42:42.928 --> 00:42:47.409]  But now quite a few of your team members have committed suicide or died in weird car wrecks.
[00:42:47.409 --> 00:42:48.770]  And you know they're killing you.
[00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.770]  You know they're killing your men now, aren't they?
[00:42:51.807 --> 00:42:56.729]  Yeah, in fact, you're even scared to tune in on the web and listen to this show, because you know it's all surveilled.
[00:42:56.729 --> 00:43:01.011]  And now you're realizing you weren't on the winning team, were you?
[00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:04.012]  No, you're not!
[00:43:04.012 --> 00:43:06.733]  Disgusting!
[00:43:06.733 --> 00:43:11.715]  You can still ask God to forgive you, and I think, even though you planted the bombs in the towers, God will forgive you.
[00:43:11.715 --> 00:43:15.256]  If you repent, but your leaders have hardened their hearts, they're not going to.
[00:43:15.256 --> 00:43:16.657]  The guys that pulled your strings.
[00:43:18.638 --> 00:43:21.040]  They've got the will to do things.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.163]  We have the will to cut off the finger to save the body.
[00:43:24.163 --> 00:43:27.846]  To cut off the foot to save the leg.
[00:43:27.846 --> 00:43:37.715]  And weak minds like Alex Jones just can't fathom the tough decisions you've made for this country.
[00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:42.659]  This country is already gone, you idiot!
[00:43:42.659 --> 00:43:45.682]  I just popped over the old state line.
[00:43:46.938 --> 00:43:50.139]  I was focused on a welcome sign.
[00:43:50.139 --> 00:43:59.360]  When there in the bushes a-waitin' for me was a big policeman with a capital P. Look out, stranger, you're headed for danger.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.601]  There's a welcome sign ahead.
[00:44:01.601 --> 00:44:04.201]  Ha ha!
[00:44:04.201 --> 00:44:07.782]  When the sign says, Welcome to God's Country, you better look out.
[00:44:07.782 --> 00:44:09.982]  They got a mean JP.
[00:44:09.982 --> 00:44:16.003]  Fuzzy old buzzards stuffin' their craw on highway robbery in the name of the law.
[00:44:17.361 --> 00:44:20.162]  I just feel like going fishing, man.
[00:44:20.162 --> 00:44:21.502]  Big cold front blew in.
[00:44:21.502 --> 00:44:23.362]  It's about 65 degrees outside.
[00:44:23.362 --> 00:44:24.783]  I like these overcast days.
[00:44:24.783 --> 00:44:26.023]  I want to go walk through the forest.
[00:44:26.023 --> 00:44:30.724]  Instead of sitting here fighting with you CENTCOM idiots all day.
[00:44:30.724 --> 00:44:33.405]  Oh, God.
[00:44:33.405 --> 00:44:36.385]  Your whole family's future, you're flushing down the toilet.
[00:44:36.385 --> 00:44:37.606]  But you're in control.
[00:44:37.606 --> 00:44:39.266]  You're part of the command structure.
[00:44:39.266 --> 00:44:40.246]  You know it all.
[00:44:40.246 --> 00:44:41.067]  Oh, God.
[00:44:41.067 --> 00:44:45.108]  All right, let's just go to your calls.
[00:44:45.108 --> 00:44:46.108]  I'm going to go to you quick here.
[00:44:46.108 --> 00:44:46.948]  Jim and Mask, go ahead.
[00:44:47.788 --> 00:44:48.228]  Hi, Alex.
[00:44:48.228 --> 00:44:49.069]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.770]  I appreciate it.
[00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.872]  Good to hear from you.
[00:44:51.872 --> 00:44:54.034]  The reason why I'm calling is twofold.
[00:44:54.034 --> 00:45:02.422]  First, a couple of weeks ago you had talked about the police chief in Springfield, Mass., wanting to have his officers dressed in black.
[00:45:02.422 --> 00:45:03.763]  Yeah, that was in the Associated Press.
[00:45:03.763 --> 00:45:05.304]  He said for intimidation.
[00:45:05.304 --> 00:45:05.765]  Right.
[00:45:05.765 --> 00:45:11.370]  Well, I live in Central Mass., outside of the second largest city in Massachusetts, which is Worcester.
[00:45:12.163 --> 00:45:16.905]  And the suburban cops have been dressing in black here for the last two years.
[00:45:16.905 --> 00:45:22.967]  It started with the canine cops, and then it now migrated into the cruiser police officers.
[00:45:22.967 --> 00:45:24.568]  Well, you know, we have the federal grants.
[00:45:24.568 --> 00:45:25.788]  Why'd they do that?
[00:45:25.788 --> 00:45:26.429]  Right.
[00:45:26.429 --> 00:45:27.189]  You know why they do that?
[00:45:27.928 --> 00:45:30.809]  The federal grant says it is to project authority, i.e.
[00:45:30.809 --> 00:45:36.211]  intimidate people, as they admit, but also so that you don't recognize who they are.
[00:45:36.211 --> 00:45:49.777]  And it's going from a respectable suit of a guardian with, you know, the epaulets and the rest of it, to a monkey suit, a goon suit with a black baseball cap, so they can mix them in with felons and foreigners and military.
[00:45:50.313 --> 00:45:50.833]  Right.
[00:45:50.833 --> 00:45:55.696]  I'm going to try to get it on my flip camcorder for you and send it over to y'all.
[00:45:55.696 --> 00:45:56.316]  Are you kidding?
[00:45:56.316 --> 00:45:58.418]  I mean, I see the cops everywhere.
[00:45:58.418 --> 00:45:59.598]  They're dressed like that.
[00:45:59.598 --> 00:46:00.599]  It's unbelievable.
[00:46:00.599 --> 00:46:12.165]  You know, and I actually asked one because he was at the veterinarian with his German Shepherd and I was there with my dog and I said, what's with all the camos and the black marine uniforms and everything?
[00:46:12.165 --> 00:46:15.247]  And he says, well, you know, a police officer is a paramilitary anyways.
[00:46:16.355 --> 00:46:21.296]  And I'm like, yeah, to a certain extent, I thought more or less the state police are like that.
[00:46:21.296 --> 00:46:24.937]  He said, oh no, the locals were being indoctrinated with that, too.
[00:46:24.937 --> 00:46:27.038]  And I had a little conversation with him.
[00:46:27.038 --> 00:46:28.358]  It was just very surprising.
[00:46:28.358 --> 00:46:28.598]  That's good.
[00:46:28.598 --> 00:46:31.939]  They're going to take his mama's bank account just as much as they're going to take my mama's.
[00:46:31.939 --> 00:46:33.719]  He gets to be part of what he delivers.
[00:46:33.719 --> 00:46:34.219]  Yeah.
[00:46:34.219 --> 00:46:39.221]  Now, the second point is we're homeschoolers, and we're part of a homeschooling group here.
[00:46:39.221 --> 00:46:44.982]  And we had one of our families go into the local library a couple weeks ago, like they normally do.
[00:46:45.695 --> 00:46:51.638]  And, uh, about three days ago, she had a warrant served on her by the local police.
[00:46:51.638 --> 00:46:56.801]  Four cruisers went flying up into her driveway and they executed a search warrant.
[00:46:56.801 --> 00:46:58.422]  And she said, well, what's this all about?
[00:46:58.422 --> 00:47:07.327]  And he said, well, you know, you stole some books from the library and come to find out her 13 year old son thought his mother had checked them out and put them in the book bag.
[00:47:07.327 --> 00:47:10.269]  And she says, well, you know, it was just an honest mistake.
[00:47:10.269 --> 00:47:12.790]  He, uh, he arrested her for a felony over $250 for larceny.
[00:47:14.821 --> 00:47:15.181]  Uh huh, yeah.
[00:47:30.615 --> 00:47:36.458]  You know, we know about you homeschoolers, and we're going to do everything in our power to make sure that we pass a law.
[00:47:36.458 --> 00:47:38.139]  Have her contact me.
[00:47:38.139 --> 00:47:38.959]  Look, this is what happens.
[00:47:38.959 --> 00:47:41.280]  You have the communists that work at the library.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.741]  They really hate homeschoolers.
[00:47:42.741 --> 00:47:50.805]  They think they're being given their enlightenment in the public school, learning how to use Ritalin, Prozac, cocaine, heroin, and listen to gangbang music.
[00:47:51.351 --> 00:47:53.033]  And so they spy on them.
[00:47:53.033 --> 00:47:56.898]  Listen, this has been happening in Round Rock, in Williamson County, for a long time.
[00:47:56.898 --> 00:48:04.647]  Your video, that you leave under your seat of your car, you forget, and they call, and you know, the kid's got the flu, so you don't return the Blockbuster video.
[00:48:04.647 --> 00:48:10.013]  Within two days, and this has been in the paper, the police come and arrest you, and they charge you for stealing the video.
[00:48:10.657 --> 00:48:11.237]  Okay, great.
[00:48:30.512 --> 00:48:31.052]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:48:31.052 --> 00:48:31.413]  You bet.
[00:48:31.413 --> 00:48:33.815]  Tell the story, though, so Trey knows what he's reading when he sees it.
[00:48:33.815 --> 00:48:35.096]  Trey at Infowars.com.
[00:48:35.096 --> 00:48:36.277]  Aaron at Infowars.com.
[00:48:36.277 --> 00:48:38.538]  Trey with an E. Aaron with two As.
[00:48:38.538 --> 00:48:41.681]  Yeah, that brings me... I've got news here.
[00:48:41.681 --> 00:48:44.503]  Where have you... Go over the speeding limit.
[00:48:44.503 --> 00:48:50.368]  In Florida, you'll get five to ten years in jail now that they passed that law.
[00:48:50.368 --> 00:48:59.115]  And all over the country, especially in Texas, we have more prisons than any other, you know, per square mile anywhere in the world in Texas.
[00:49:00.444 --> 00:49:01.446]  And they lobby.
[00:49:01.446 --> 00:49:03.188]  You can just Google it.
[00:49:03.188 --> 00:49:05.451]  Private prisons lobby for tougher laws.
[00:49:05.451 --> 00:49:06.152]  And it'll come up.
[00:49:06.152 --> 00:49:09.738]  A bunch of stories in news reports saying how wonderful it is.
[00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:10.499]  And they go lobby.
[00:49:10.499 --> 00:49:13.083]  They say, we want minor infractions, hard jail time.
[00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:14.004]  And they say, absolutely.
[00:49:14.919 --> 00:49:16.440]  And that's how it works.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:26.524]  Look, when you go from 300,000 cops to 2 million cops, and now they're going to have 2 million environmental enforcers, and they got, what is it, like 5 million CPS workers or something?
[00:49:26.524 --> 00:49:28.345]  Or total social workers?
[00:49:28.345 --> 00:49:30.426]  I mean, the numbers are just off the charts.
[00:49:30.426 --> 00:49:32.026]  They're just everywhere.
[00:49:32.026 --> 00:49:33.307]  And they're going to find something to do.
[00:49:34.656 --> 00:49:44.921]  Uh, you know, you're gonna get months in jail for a banana peel, you're gonna get years in jail for a AA battery in your backyard your kid dropped out of a toy, but that's already happened, that's why I'm saying that.
[00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:56.267]  And, uh, it's, uh, I have the mainstream news articles here today where all of this is happening, and I have told my wife to not go to the library anymore.
[00:49:56.267 --> 00:50:03.290]  And she likes to go, and the kids like it, and they'll get like 20 books, and then we've got hundreds of books, we've probably got 500 children's books we've bought.
[00:50:03.908 --> 00:50:07.549]  And then hundreds of them that my parents gave me and others, just piles of them.
[00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:09.349]  The kids read all the time.
[00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:16.451]  And I've told my wife, I've said, do not go to the library anymore, because we get these library notices.
[00:50:16.451 --> 00:50:19.492]  Probably about to get SWAT teamed over this, admitting this.
[00:50:19.492 --> 00:50:20.692]  And you know, she's got to pay bills.
[00:50:20.692 --> 00:50:27.054]  She can't find it, so she's got to mail in a hundred bucks, because she can't find the little book that they claim is a hundred bucks.
[00:50:27.054 --> 00:50:29.074]  You know, as they got these fines.
[00:50:29.074 --> 00:50:31.395]  And I said, listen, they're going to come here and arrest us.
[00:50:32.319 --> 00:50:33.180]  Okay?
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.461]  No more library!
[00:50:35.461 --> 00:50:36.421]  Okay?
[00:50:36.421 --> 00:50:37.762]  No more.
[00:50:37.762 --> 00:50:39.503]  No more.
[00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:41.064]  Now, not every area does it.
[00:50:41.064 --> 00:50:43.225]  Austin, that I know, doesn't come arrest you yet.
[00:50:43.225 --> 00:50:44.606]  But I don't take it for granted.
[00:50:44.606 --> 00:50:47.668]  I just do not go to the library.
[00:50:47.668 --> 00:50:51.950]  And, uh... I always get a receipt when I pump gas, because they'll swap-team you for that.
[00:50:54.133 --> 00:50:56.995]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:50:56.995 --> 00:50:58.556]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:50:58.556 --> 00:51:00.697]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:00.697 --> 00:51:02.598]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:02.598 --> 00:51:04.099]  The late great USA.
[00:51:04.099 --> 00:51:05.860]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:12.884]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:52:04.202 --> 00:52:08.425]  In this Another Untold Story, we would ask that you excuse our dirty talk.
[00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:11.727]  Now with that said, we shall talk dirty by saying, yada, yada, yada.
[00:52:27.048 --> 00:52:40.613]  Now you hear people say that all the time and they and you do not know what it means, what is said, what yada yada means or how it came to be in our society and vocabulary.
[00:52:40.613 --> 00:52:41.753]  Yada yada yada.
[00:52:42.546 --> 00:52:47.991]  Believe it or not, it is part of a war being waged against you and your country.
[00:52:47.991 --> 00:52:53.977]  And since we are talking dirty talk, let's talk about the word people refer to as the F-word.
[00:52:53.977 --> 00:53:01.405]  Most do not know the origin of that word either, and the true original meaning of it.
[00:53:01.405 --> 00:53:05.949]  And what does that word have to do with the word yada yada?
[00:53:06.892 --> 00:53:16.655]  Oh, it's quite a story that's not being told as everyone uses these dirty words, but we tell it at AnotherUntoldStory.com.

[00:53:40.691 --> 00:53:41.171]  We are armed!
[00:53:57.014 --> 00:54:02.558]  Yeah, try woman arrested for unreturned library books.
[00:54:19.929 --> 00:54:30.951]  And it's always the same, the person checked out hundreds, and you can find a bunch of stories on Google, and then they forget one or they lose one, or more often than not, they turn it in and somebody doesn't file it right.
[00:54:30.951 --> 00:54:45.194]  And it's not the librarians that are doing this, the police are just sitting around waiting with their attack dogs and the rest of it, just wanting something, just, oh, give us something, oh man, oh, and yeah, look at you, homeschooling trash.
[00:54:48.277 --> 00:54:49.478]  We're going to get you.
[00:54:49.478 --> 00:54:50.719]  You're against the state.
[00:54:50.719 --> 00:54:51.340]  And they got them.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:54.442]  They got these mental patients, psychopaths everywhere.
[00:54:54.442 --> 00:54:56.484]  All over the country, the feds are doing drills.
[00:54:56.484 --> 00:55:02.349]  And they've had this in Austin, where I-35 gets shut down to some vet sees a box on the street and has a flashback.
[00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:06.673]  And they run up to the box and always act like it's real and freak out.
[00:55:06.673 --> 00:55:11.217]  Because they've got to give their guys in black uniforms something to do, to freak out about and fearmonger about.
[00:55:12.461 --> 00:55:14.822]  Just a nation of total cowardice.
[00:55:14.822 --> 00:55:28.068]  But again, they always treat it as real, so that they can get everybody to keep reporting it, and the local report of the local Austin robot blew up a cardboard box by a trash can in downtown, and then everybody goes, Oh, terrorists!
[00:55:28.068 --> 00:55:31.269]  Oh, they're keeping me safe from them!
[00:55:31.269 --> 00:55:37.812]  Yeah, arresting you two days after your Blockbuster video's not turned in.
[00:55:37.812 --> 00:55:41.314]  I've seen that in the news in Williamshire County, and I know somebody had happened to it.
[00:55:45.359 --> 00:55:48.902]  And when they say to the cops, they say, what do you mean it's just a few days late?
[00:55:48.902 --> 00:55:50.943]  And they're like, shut up, you criminal!
[00:55:50.943 --> 00:55:52.124]  You know what you've done!
[00:55:52.124 --> 00:55:53.745]  We rule!
[00:55:53.745 --> 00:55:56.487]  Oh, it's so sick.
[00:55:56.487 --> 00:55:57.728]  Let's talk to Steve in Illinois.
[00:55:57.728 --> 00:55:58.449]  David just hung up.
[00:55:58.449 --> 00:55:59.429]  And Tim, Jay, and others.
[00:55:59.429 --> 00:56:00.950]  Go ahead, Steve.
[00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:01.451]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:01.451 --> 00:56:03.192]  Thanks for taking the time to talk to me.
[00:56:03.192 --> 00:56:04.393]  Good, hardcore criminal.
[00:56:04.393 --> 00:56:05.574]  You ever had a late library book?
[00:56:06.832 --> 00:56:08.353]  Yeah, many of them.
[00:56:08.353 --> 00:56:10.015]  Well, that's why I don't... Exactly.
[00:56:10.015 --> 00:56:17.661]  And again, I read these stories all the time where somebody pumps gas, the credit card goes through, but somehow then doesn't register, and they don't get a receipt.
[00:56:17.661 --> 00:56:18.041]  Boom.
[00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:22.225]  They call the cops, they arrest them, beat them up, felony, life's over, doesn't matter.
[00:56:22.225 --> 00:56:27.028]  If there's even video, you stick on the card in, they say, doesn't matter, should have made sure.
[00:56:27.028 --> 00:56:35.235]  So I always get that receipt, and then if it doesn't print, I go in and demand one, and they always ninny and fussle bustle, and I go, listen, you're not releasing them on me.
[00:56:35.235 --> 00:56:36.356]  You're not gonna release them.
[00:56:36.991 --> 00:56:37.912]  Go ahead.
[00:56:37.912 --> 00:56:38.732]  Well, it's good to know.
[00:56:38.732 --> 00:56:39.873]  Thank you.
[00:56:39.873 --> 00:57:02.170]  I wanted to mention something to you, and it might have been, my question might have been answered by the last caller, but I live in a suburb of Chicago, and yesterday I was driving down the road with my kids in the car, and I came across this golf course that's closed down, and they had about five police trucks, you know, mobile command units and stuff in the parking lot.
[00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:14.130]  These trucks were from a town about 30 miles away from us, and there was five officers in a parking lot in full military, what looked like full military combat gear.
[00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:18.491]  And they had a big sign out there that just said, police training in process.
[00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:27.154]  Yeah, all over the country, um, that may have just been some regular training, but all over the country, there's federalization drills, it's federal mustards.
[00:57:27.154 --> 00:57:32.556]  And the dumb cops don't even know that, they just say, it's federal program, we all muster, prepare to fight, okay?
[00:57:33.351 --> 00:57:37.276]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:57:37.276 --> 00:57:49.632]  I was just wondering, I mean, because I know that, you know, I'm a first-time caller, but I've been listening to your show for a while, you know, and I know that there's like martial law happening in certain parts of the country, police state and stuff, and I'm just wondering if this could be
[00:57:50.805 --> 00:57:53.107]  Like training for something like that, you know?
[00:57:53.107 --> 00:57:58.331]  Oh, they did camp internment relocation drills in Chicago yesterday.
[00:57:58.331 --> 00:57:58.931]  The day before.
[00:57:58.931 --> 00:58:05.996]  And in the stockyards in a major city.
[00:58:05.996 --> 00:58:09.279]  Oh, which city is that?
[00:58:09.279 --> 00:58:16.504]  They did mass processing drills at the old stockyards.
[00:58:16.504 --> 00:58:17.925]  In Chicago?
[00:58:17.925 --> 00:58:20.067]  No, that was in Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:58:22.133 --> 00:58:23.254]  I've got to pull the article out.
[00:58:23.254 --> 00:58:24.695]  Sometimes my memory fails.
[00:58:24.695 --> 00:58:25.576]  That was just a couple days ago.
[00:58:25.576 --> 00:58:26.036]  We covered that.
[00:58:26.036 --> 00:58:26.397]  Stay there.
[00:58:26.397 --> 00:58:27.838]  We'll talk more about it.
[00:58:27.838 --> 00:58:28.338]  Listen.
[00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:29.339]  You want to read about camps?
[00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:30.480]  It's in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.841]  It's in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:35.485]  It's in the government documents.
[00:58:35.485 --> 00:58:38.727]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:38.727 --> 00:58:44.512]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.512 --> 00:58:46.994]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:46.994 --> 00:58:48.756]  A new world order.
[00:58:48.756 --> 00:58:49.697]  In the near future.
[00:58:50.552 --> 00:58:53.614]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:58:53.614 --> 00:58:56.455]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.455 --> 00:58:59.237]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[00:58:59.237 --> 00:59:02.419]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.419 --> 00:59:09.743]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:12.785 --> 00:59:18.231]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.231 --> 00:59:22.094]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:22.094 --> 00:59:24.657]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:24.657 --> 00:59:25.818]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:25.818 --> 00:59:26.619]  They're not after money.
[00:59:26.619 --> 00:59:27.880]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:28.881]  They're after power.
[00:59:28.881 --> 00:59:30.022]  That's what they're after.

[00:59:41.509 --> 00:59:46.551]  You have been warned.
[00:59:46.551 --> 00:59:48.952]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:51.713]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.337 --> 01:00:14.708]  I'm going through my news to see what city that was in a few days ago where they admitted they were doing drills for mass arrest and they've taken over the old rodeo fairgrounds slash beef processing facility
[01:00:27.571 --> 01:00:33.073]  It's all over InfoWars and Prison Planet, but in a 70-second break, I can't... I can't find it.
[01:00:33.073 --> 01:00:37.034]  I'm going through like a stack of 200 articles here, trying to find it.
[01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:40.815]  In-body scanners could warn doctors.
[01:00:40.815 --> 01:00:45.977]  Oh, I've got... I hate to mention something like that and then not have it in front of me, and my memory's failing on it.
[01:00:45.977 --> 01:00:47.838]  It's driving me up the wall.
[01:00:47.838 --> 01:00:53.180]  Somebody will call me, and I want to say it was in... I know it's in the Midwest.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.380]  It's just driving me crazy.
[01:00:55.461 --> 01:00:56.242]  Oh, it doesn't exist.
[01:00:56.242 --> 01:00:56.662]  Everything's fine.
[01:00:56.662 --> 01:00:58.203]  The government's wonderful.
[01:00:58.203 --> 01:01:03.907]  Let's go ahead and go to Tim in Montana.
[01:01:03.907 --> 01:01:05.368]  You're on the air.
[01:01:05.368 --> 01:01:06.128]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:06.128 --> 01:01:07.529]  I wanted to say hello.
[01:01:07.529 --> 01:01:08.830]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:09.611]  Good.
[01:01:09.611 --> 01:01:19.357]  I'm the Ron Paul organizer up here, and Jack McLam told you about that show that we had, and we packed the studio.
[01:01:19.357 --> 01:01:24.701]  I got a couple things about JFK, but first I wanted to read, it's just like one sentence long,
[01:01:25.621 --> 01:01:52.821]  It has to do with something your guest said yesterday, and I know the first part talks about eugenics, which of course we all agree on, and the final quote is, at the base of this new world order is the ideology of women's empowerment, which erroneously sees the principal obstacles to a woman's fulfillment as the family and maternity
[01:01:53.686 --> 01:02:09.753]  And then the fellow goes on to say, at this stage of the development of the new image of the new world, Christians, and not just them, but in any case, they, even more than others, have the duty to protest.
[01:02:09.753 --> 01:02:17.617]  And I sent you this article about an hour ago or so, and that is from Cardinal Ratzinger in September 19th of 2000.
[01:02:17.617 --> 01:02:18.117]  Interesting.
[01:02:18.117 --> 01:02:18.197]  Yeah.
[01:02:21.229 --> 01:02:30.013]  So it appears that he's not only aware of what's going on, but that he's not for it.
[01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:38.796]  Now, that's just... And some of the other good news is we've had a lot... We heckled Bill Clinton yesterday.
[01:02:38.796 --> 01:02:40.337]  He was here.
[01:02:40.337 --> 01:02:43.678]  We've passed out over a thousand endgames in our town.
[01:02:43.678 --> 01:02:44.959]  Thank you, sir.
[01:02:44.959 --> 01:02:50.961]  And I gave one about two or three weeks ago to a 9-11 Commission person named Bob Carey.
[01:02:52.205 --> 01:03:05.741]  And I also gave him my... I can't give away all of your videos, so I've... I edited down a couple of Griffins and three of yours and lay out the 20th century, and I gave him one of those, too.
[01:03:05.741 --> 01:03:06.722]  He was not very happy.
[01:03:06.722 --> 01:03:09.846]  He had a couple of us who were asking him some tough questions.
[01:03:10.393 --> 01:03:13.614]  Well, the power of folks like you out there handing out the films.
[01:03:13.614 --> 01:03:18.816]  The films are, my films and other films, are the most effective tool because we're a visual society.
[01:03:18.816 --> 01:03:21.176]  That's how people take in information.
[01:03:21.176 --> 01:03:24.317]  They'll sit down, they'll watch it, and it really wakes people up.
[01:03:24.317 --> 01:03:27.438]  It's a thousand times more effective than just talking to somebody.
[01:03:27.438 --> 01:03:33.400]  And talking's still good, but I mean, films are changing people's lives, and I really appreciate your call.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.120]  Good to hear from you.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:37.341]  Jay in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:03:37.341 --> 01:03:38.562]  Yeah, Jones.
[01:03:38.562 --> 01:03:38.742]  Yes.
[01:03:39.295 --> 01:03:40.556]  How are you doing there today, sir?
[01:03:40.556 --> 01:03:41.236]  Good!
[01:03:41.236 --> 01:03:44.018]  Wonderful, yeah, I wish you could get outside and enjoy that weather.
[01:03:44.018 --> 01:03:45.778]  I enjoy that weather, too.
[01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:51.121]  Yeah, so, um, I just wanted to let everybody know out there that this is a real call.
[01:03:51.121 --> 01:03:54.063]  We don't need propaganda in our revolution.
[01:03:54.063 --> 01:04:02.728]  You know, just go look at alexjonesmoneybomb.com and you'll see we're on a move, and soon you'll be licking our boots!
[01:04:02.728 --> 01:04:07.050]  Okay, that's a first, because we had some questions about fake callers and stuff.
[01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:09.326]  What does that mean?
[01:04:09.326 --> 01:04:10.526]  Let me just stop you, sir.
[01:04:10.526 --> 01:04:11.387]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:04:11.387 --> 01:04:26.794]  I know you're being sarcastic, and it's kind of a prank call, and that's fine and dandy, but if you dislike me or whatever, and I'm sure the type that also posts that all my calls are screened and fake, but here you are calling in, just go ahead and make whatever point you want.
[01:04:26.794 --> 01:04:36.518]  Okay, my point was, we've been talking about the disinformation in our movement that's out there, with all the videos, I guess, and all that stuff that's out there,
[01:04:37.159 --> 01:04:37.379]  Stay there.

[01:05:51.055 --> 01:05:58.059]  Hi neighbor, no matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[01:05:58.059 --> 01:06:04.543]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[01:06:04.543 --> 01:06:08.445]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[01:06:08.445 --> 01:06:11.667]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:16.309]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:21.553]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[01:06:21.553 --> 01:06:24.174]  We will still have two regrets.
[01:06:24.174 --> 01:06:28.196]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[01:06:28.196 --> 01:06:31.859]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[01:06:31.859 --> 01:06:38.683]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[01:06:39.483 --> 01:06:40.925]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633

[01:06:55.242 --> 01:07:00.345]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:00.345 --> 01:07:01.846]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[01:07:50.751 --> 01:07:56.176]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:56.176 --> 01:07:58.439]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:59.631 --> 01:08:03.933]  I'm glad I've expanded the radio show to four hours, because I've only gone for an hour and five minutes.
[01:08:03.933 --> 01:08:05.674]  I feel like I haven't covered enough yet.
[01:08:05.674 --> 01:08:07.015]  I've got so much I want to get to.
[01:08:07.015 --> 01:08:08.636]  We've got Jim Tucker coming in.
[01:08:08.636 --> 01:08:16.841]  Jason Bermas is going to pop in for about ten minutes with his crazy story of the screw-loose changers admitting, yeah, I'm getting my microchip in the military, but so what?
[01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:17.221]  It's good.
[01:08:17.221 --> 01:08:18.722]  I love it.
[01:08:18.722 --> 01:08:20.903]  So people really going through a lot of denial there.
[01:08:22.481 --> 01:08:27.385]  And of course, more of your phone calls are rocketing through those right now as fast as I can.
[01:08:27.385 --> 01:08:29.386]  Going back to Jay in Florida.
[01:08:29.386 --> 01:08:33.109]  Okay, maybe I'm stupid, but I'm missing the points you're making.
[01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:36.792]  It sounds somewhat sarcastic, but go ahead and try to make your point.
[01:08:36.792 --> 01:08:37.993]  Okay, I'm sorry about that, Alex.
[01:08:37.993 --> 01:08:39.214]  I was just joking around there.
[01:08:39.214 --> 01:08:40.074]  You know, you like to joke.
[01:08:40.074 --> 01:08:41.135]  I like to joke.
[01:08:41.135 --> 01:08:42.836]  No, I'm saying I'm stupid.
[01:08:42.836 --> 01:08:46.119]  I didn't get the joke, but go ahead.
[01:08:46.119 --> 01:08:50.002]  Yesterday, you had said that you had reports that people said that it was on the Internet that
[01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:56.653]  These calls weren't real, and that, you know, it was staged or whatever, and I was just trying to make a point that this is not staged.
[01:08:56.653 --> 01:09:01.075]  We don't need to stage our things, because we are real, you know?
[01:09:01.075 --> 01:09:12.261]  And, I mean, I'm part of, I'm helping out on the AlexJonesMoneyBomb.com, I've pledged, and I just, my one question for you is, I was just looking at John Todd.
[01:09:12.261 --> 01:09:13.682]  Have you done any research on that guy?
[01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:14.803]  Who is it?
[01:09:15.433 --> 01:09:17.413]  Um, he claims he's from the 70s.
[01:09:17.413 --> 01:09:25.755]  Remember back in the 70s when there was big revivals against rock music and the whole Christian thing was really in a revival kind of movement, the mid-70s?
[01:09:25.755 --> 01:09:30.576]  I remember getting like the Peters Brothers tapes on backward masking the evils of rock and roll.
[01:09:30.576 --> 01:09:37.717]  This guy says he came out of the occult and he was a member of the Illuminati and he was on the Council of 13.
[01:09:37.717 --> 01:09:43.398]  You can go on YouTube and listen to all of his old tapes and supposedly
[01:09:43.925 --> 01:09:56.771]  He preached for a few years, his life was threatened, and then he gets caught up in something that lands him in jail, and they say that he was set up for driving some girl across the country, and the Illuminati finally got him.
[01:09:56.771 --> 01:10:05.955]  And the thing that's interesting about it is, if you listen to his stuff, he explains the Federal Reserve, the way that the Illuminati controls everything, their signs.
[01:10:05.955 --> 01:10:09.757]  He does go really a little bit crazy on the rock and roll aspect of
[01:10:11.013 --> 01:10:28.099]  Look, I just, you know, I don't know about that and I really have found that a lot of those guys, I mean, there's people who pop up all the time claiming their Illuminati this and their World Order that and they'll show you their mason ring and then they put them on the religious circuit to go around and scare everybody.
[01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:38.043]  You know, I just cover the news I have in front of me of what they're doing and I try to stick to that and so I don't really spend a lot of time, you know,
[01:10:38.427 --> 01:10:42.690]  With those other groups and organizations that are out there.
[01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:45.792]  I've seen these other guys who say they're apart.
[01:10:45.792 --> 01:10:48.454]  This is the only guy that really makes me question it.
[01:10:48.454 --> 01:10:51.997]  I was just calling to see because I'm trying to get to the bottom of his thing.
[01:10:51.997 --> 01:10:56.820]  You know, putting the pieces together here, which you do really well, man, and I appreciate all your films.
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:00.303]  Okay, well listen, I appreciate your call and it's good to talk to you, Jay.
[01:11:00.303 --> 01:11:01.884]  Trying to move through these calls quick here.
[01:11:01.884 --> 01:11:06.768]  I'm not criticizing any individual or any group or any people.
[01:11:07.637 --> 01:11:11.921]  It's just, I can't really comment on somebody who I don't know who they are.
[01:11:11.921 --> 01:11:12.301]  Okay?
[01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:18.065]  I mean, people all the time email me and they say, you know who this person is, you haven't covered it, and you need to cover it.
[01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:22.629]  I mean, there are millions of people, I don't know who they are.
[01:11:22.629 --> 01:11:31.736]  I heard some PhD guy on the radio yesterday about vaccines, who I thought was great, and he turns out to be pretty big, and I didn't even know who he was.
[01:11:31.736 --> 01:11:36.120]  So, I just try to stick with what you can prove, what you know is real,
[01:11:40.322 --> 01:11:49.986]  I mean, I got a lot of criticism because I wouldn't talk about Planet X in 98, 99, 2000, 2001, 2002, and people said I was covering up that.
[01:11:49.986 --> 01:11:57.910]  You know, a lot of it is, I just, if I can't prove something, I don't cover it, and I just don't know about all these groups and all this stuff.
[01:11:57.910 --> 01:12:01.352]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:12:01.352 --> 01:12:03.333]  Let's talk to Will in Philly.
[01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:03.773]  You're on the air.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.100]  Good day, sir.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.902]  I love you when you're in the mood like this.
[01:12:07.902 --> 01:12:08.463]  I really do.
[01:12:08.463 --> 01:12:09.223]  It's great.
[01:12:09.223 --> 01:12:13.286]  The last caller I could tell, I could tell it was a... Sometimes you get caught up in the moment.
[01:12:13.286 --> 01:12:20.151]  You can't... You think it's some guy pranking, but I could tell he was just, you know, he was just mirroring your sarcasm.
[01:12:20.151 --> 01:12:30.038]  John Todd was talking about this stuff in 1978, Alex, and I believe... My discern... I've been looking at this stuff for about 15 years myself, and I think my discernment's on point.
[01:12:30.038 --> 01:12:33.000]  This guy was on point, and suddenly he disappeared.
[01:12:34.656 --> 01:12:55.125]  But I called you to talk about, uh, I forgot to tell you the last couple times we talked, I called Stu Bykovsky, the jag-off from Philadelphia Daily News, and I, uh, he says, I got it on record, you can go to my MySpace, I can give that out later if it's okay, but he says, he contends that he didn't write the headline
[01:12:55.583 --> 01:12:57.123]  And that's how it is in journalism.
[01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:58.084]  I'm not familiar with that.
[01:12:58.084 --> 01:12:59.244]  Could you speak to that?
[01:12:59.244 --> 01:13:00.384]  That is the case.
[01:13:00.384 --> 01:13:03.445]  Editors, about half the time... Okay.
[01:13:03.445 --> 01:13:13.367]  At the same time, Jones, he said, in the article itself, now he tells me, now, if you look at the context of the article, I never said anything like that.
[01:13:13.367 --> 01:13:14.907]  Now, I said, well, look, I got it right here.
[01:13:14.907 --> 01:13:19.788]  You say, one month from the anniversary, I'm thinking another 9-11 would help America.
[01:13:19.788 --> 01:13:21.088]  He says, I said that?
[01:13:21.088 --> 01:13:22.268]  Are you on the internet with that?
[01:13:22.268 --> 01:13:24.129]  I said, no, I have the daily newspaper right here.
[01:13:26.088 --> 01:13:32.630]  If you want to hear the first conversation about six, seven months ago, a little after the story broke, you can go to my MySpace.
[01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:43.973]  MySpace.com slash P-A-Y-Z-E, and there's also, that's the prelude to a song that I have that features you, and I think you would like it very much.
[01:13:43.973 --> 01:13:53.775]  It's called Victim's Revenge, and it has you cleverly, I'm a humble man, I'm my own worst critic, but I put you cleverly throughout the song saying things.
[01:13:53.775 --> 01:13:55.556]  Well, I appreciate that, but let me go back here.
[01:13:56.703 --> 01:14:13.569]  Yeah, I interviewed that guy and tore him up, and they admit what they've done, they admit what they said, and he does say in the article that I'm thinking another 9-11 would be good, and then we have Republican memos and government memos saying the same thing, and PNAC saying it before it happened.
[01:14:13.569 --> 01:14:24.473]  So, yeah, he just got, with their arrogance, he got caught with his pants down, and he did write articles trying to backtrack, saying, that's not what I meant, you know, the editor said that, but then the
[01:14:26.371 --> 01:14:32.856]  I'm going from memory here, but the editor then came out and said, no, that's basically what he says here in the article, and then they stood by it.
[01:14:32.856 --> 01:14:34.617]  So yeah, he's engaged in a lot of disinfo.
[01:14:34.617 --> 01:14:35.798]  Good to hear from you.
[01:14:35.798 --> 01:14:44.263]  Speaking of not being able to remember, the earlier caller at the end of the last hour was asking about seeing police run around in camo and weird drills going on.
[01:14:44.263 --> 01:14:50.668]  Then I mentioned how at a giant stockyards fairground,
[01:14:51.781 --> 01:14:57.387]  That one of the largest in the country, the government had taken it over for a month to do drills.
[01:14:57.387 --> 01:15:02.272]  And then it turned out they actually arrested illegal aliens and did raids of whole families and put them in there.
[01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:14.898]  And, uh, but Rex 84 and then current documents say that they will set the camps up in the name of illegals, get the people accepting it because, oh, well, they're getting them out of here, and then really use it on political dissidents.
[01:15:14.898 --> 01:15:16.519]  We're seeing a lot of activity right now.
[01:15:16.519 --> 01:15:17.640]  It's kind of like troop movements.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.581]  You know, that's how you can tell when something's about to happen.
[01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:21.283]  Well, this is similar to troop movements.
[01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:23.444]  And now, though, they've had so many big drills.
[01:15:23.444 --> 01:15:24.365]  They get bigger and bigger.
[01:15:24.365 --> 01:15:26.426]  This could be a buildup to something in the future.
[01:15:26.426 --> 01:15:29.229]  Could be a prelude to something now or in the near future.
[01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.649]  I don't know.
[01:15:30.954 --> 01:15:32.955]  But yeah, it was Des Moines, Iowa.
[01:15:32.955 --> 01:15:33.956]  I just wanted to be sure.
[01:15:33.956 --> 01:15:36.617]  I said Des Moines, Iowa, and then I questioned my memory on that.
[01:15:36.617 --> 01:15:41.239]  As predicted last week, ICE has begun factory raids of illegal aliens in Iowa.
[01:15:41.239 --> 01:15:42.519]  We were able to predict that.
[01:15:42.519 --> 01:15:44.080]  Lee Rogers was.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:56.166]  Des Moines Register and Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported that FEMA and ICE took over the National Cattle Congress fairgrounds in Waterloo, Iowa until May 25th.
[01:15:57.341 --> 01:16:26.870]  and began moving trailers and generators on location two weeks ago and now they and then Lee Rogers accurately predicted they were gonna first arrest a bunch of illegal aliens as the pretext for that but then I submit it's also a drill for everybody else it's a mass disaster drill so when they start mixing drills with reality you better look out and we're on record saying that you know a decade ago that they would do this first to illegal aliens and then the citizens and you go what do you want you say arrest the illegals
[01:16:27.774 --> 01:16:35.598]  No, I'm saying arrest the illegals, deport them, but at the same time, the best way to do this is prosecute employers.
[01:16:35.598 --> 01:16:38.199]  I don't hire illegal aliens.
[01:16:38.199 --> 01:16:39.760]  Myself.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.662]  You know how hard it is to find a part-time nanny who's not from Latin America?
[01:16:43.662 --> 01:16:48.084]  Not that I'm against a Latin American nanny, it's that they're all illegal aliens.
[01:16:48.084 --> 01:16:53.407]  Do you have any idea how hard it is to get somebody to clean your house?
[01:16:53.407 --> 01:16:56.108]  Because I have somebody clean my house because I'm busy working all the time.
[01:16:56.108 --> 01:16:57.289]  I can either do that or clean my house.
[01:16:57.807 --> 01:17:00.108]  It comes twice a week, and I mean, it is hard.
[01:17:00.108 --> 01:17:02.730]  You've got to pay about twice as much for an American.
[01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:03.870]  But I do that.
[01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:07.693]  So I try to, you know, walk the walk, talk, you know.
[01:17:07.693 --> 01:17:10.774]  If you talk the talk, you walk the walk.
[01:17:10.774 --> 01:17:11.515]  Oh, man.
[01:17:11.515 --> 01:17:16.077]  But there it is for you, and the headline is, Illegal Alien Raid Part of FEMA Camp Drill.
[01:17:16.077 --> 01:17:20.540]  You can just Google that, and you'll find it at Infowars.com or RevGovernment.com.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.401]  Another site out there with good info.
[01:17:25.413 --> 01:17:28.915]  And then there's Chicago citizens reject terror drill, fear-mongering.
[01:17:28.915 --> 01:17:52.650]  About 350 out of an expected 4,000 participants in bio-attack processing exercise at Sears Center Arena, the latest opportunity for authorities to grandstand, fear-monger, and practice processing citizens through a de facto internment camp, fell flat on its face yesterday when just 350 of an expected 4,000 turned up to participate in a mock terror drill at Chicago's Sears Center Arena.
[01:17:53.439 --> 01:18:09.426]  And boy, if you want to look at a picture of bedwetters, folks, this picture of this crowd of people, the type of ninnying chicken neck that would actually hear a government fear-mongering event and practice going to a sports stadium to be processed, I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:18:09.426 --> 01:18:15.389]  And it goes on to say, uh, an elaborate public health drill Thursday that organizers had hoped would
[01:18:16.093 --> 01:18:28.723]  Use thousands of volunteers to help test the Chicago area's response to a possible bioterrorism attack instead drew fewer than 350 people and one beleaguered Cook County Board President reports the Chicago Tribune.
[01:18:28.723 --> 01:18:33.687]  The exercise, estimated to cost $80,000, was mandated and funded by the U.S.
[01:18:33.687 --> 01:18:40.292]  Department of Homeland Security, which has called for health departments nationwide to coordinate drills since the terrorist attacks of 9-11.
[01:18:40.292 --> 01:18:42.553]  The government mandates drills since the government attacks of 9-11.
[01:18:43.474 --> 01:18:50.379]  Authorities practice processing citizens through the de facto internment camp and giving the mandatory pharmaceutical products injections.
[01:18:50.379 --> 01:18:50.900]  It goes on.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:54.222]  Paul's excellent article on that.
[01:18:54.222 --> 01:18:56.544]  Here's the actual Chicago Tribune article.
[01:18:56.544 --> 01:19:03.209]  Big public health drill has small turnout in Hoffman Estates, but Stronger, but Stroger makes a guest appearance.
[01:19:03.209 --> 01:19:06.872]  That's the name of the councilman.
[01:19:06.872 --> 01:19:08.993]  Okay, I know we got a lot of other callers.
[01:19:08.993 --> 01:19:09.714]  We're going to get to you.
[01:19:09.714 --> 01:19:09.774]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:19:13.109 --> 01:19:16.170]  Jim Tucker popping in.
[01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:21.171]  Did the Bilderberg Group really meet last week in Greece?
[01:19:21.171 --> 01:19:23.211]  Did they, after 35 years, finally beat us?
[01:19:23.211 --> 01:19:24.552]  And did we miss the location?
[01:19:24.552 --> 01:19:25.872]  Did they have it early?
[01:19:25.872 --> 01:19:28.673]  Or is this an elaborate disinfo ploy?
[01:19:28.673 --> 01:19:33.594]  We'll get Jim Tucker's take on it coming up in about 40 minutes.
[01:19:33.594 --> 01:19:37.755]  Burmese is going to be popping in the last 10 minutes of this hour to talk about
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:42.684]  The 9-11 debunkers, they're getting their microchips now.
[01:19:42.684 --> 01:19:43.725]  Seriously.
[01:19:43.725 --> 01:19:46.288]  Bunch of stupid sent-gum goofs.
[01:19:46.288 --> 01:19:50.414]  And, uh, they're kind of having a moment of confusion over it.
[01:19:51.149 --> 01:19:53.111]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:19:53.111 --> 01:19:56.735]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:19:56.735 --> 01:19:58.838]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:19:58.838 --> 01:20:02.222]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:20:02.222 --> 01:20:07.968]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:20:07.968 --> 01:20:11.893]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:20:12.193 --> 01:20:17.395]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:20:51.132 --> 01:20:57.794]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:57.794 --> 01:21:05.917]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:05.917 --> 01:21:13.759]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:14.079 --> 01:21:19.183]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:19.183 --> 01:21:24.406]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:24.406 --> 01:21:28.749]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:28.749 --> 01:21:29.830]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:34.353]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:34.353 --> 01:21:39.257]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:39.257 --> 01:21:41.759]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:42.219 --> 01:21:44.000]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:44.221]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:51.144 --> 01:21:54.905]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:21:54.905 --> 01:21:59.946]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:21:59.946 --> 01:22:05.408]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:05.408 --> 01:22:15.891]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:16.391 --> 01:22:20.794]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:20.794 --> 01:22:23.576]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:22:23.576 --> 01:22:27.138]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:22:27.138 --> 01:22:39.646]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:22:43.855 --> 01:22:48.166]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[01:22:48.166 --> 01:22:49.429]  The message of His Kingdom.
[01:22:51.536 --> 01:22:57.617]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:22:57.617 --> 01:23:03.559]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:23:03.559 --> 01:23:07.700]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:12.881]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:23:12.881 --> 01:23:20.363]  At SnyderHealth.com, we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.
[01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:31.629]  Instantly transform ordinary tap water into clean, living, energized water containing alkaline minerals, disease-fighting antioxidants, and highly absorbable oxygen.
[01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:36.851]  Now you can easily and effectively rid your body of harmful acidic waste with alkaline ionized water.
[01:23:36.851 --> 01:23:41.174]  Let SnyderHealth.com provide the water ionizer that's right for you and your family.

[01:23:50.583 --> 01:24:05.330]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:14.374]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[01:24:14.374 --> 01:24:16.695]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:24:26.015 --> 01:24:31.178]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:24:31.178 --> 01:24:34.119]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[01:24:34.119 --> 01:24:36.681]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[01:24:36.681 --> 01:24:39.162]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:47.682]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[01:24:47.682 --> 01:24:54.585]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:24:54.585 --> 01:24:59.567]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[01:24:59.567 --> 01:25:02.508]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[01:25:02.508 --> 01:25:06.790]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:09.751]  We have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[01:25:11.093 --> 01:25:15.097]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[01:25:15.097 --> 01:25:16.398]  Well, join me.
[01:25:16.398 --> 01:25:18.800]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.144]  There's a need for a new world order.
[01:25:22.144 --> 01:25:28.510]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[01:25:58.332 --> 01:26:00.310]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:01.187 --> 01:26:16.078]  A little bit late getting back in because I was doing a local phone in to 590 KLBJ, or was it 93.7 KLBJ, the FM, plugging my movie showing of Truth Rising this Saturday and Sunday at the Alamo Draft House.
[01:26:16.078 --> 01:26:17.439]  It is almost sold out.
[01:26:17.439 --> 01:26:22.343]  I'm just going to let you know now that the Saturday is almost sold out right now.
[01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:27.506]  The Sunday has got, I don't know, they said like 30% of the tickets left, but that's kind of a
[01:26:28.647 --> 01:26:34.431]  Illusion, because they hold about 10% of the tickets back for the day of at the door.
[01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:40.596]  They just do that because I want people to be able to walk up for some reason, which is fine with me, so you can also get in line.
[01:26:40.596 --> 01:26:43.658]  And I don't want to discourage people to not come.
[01:26:43.658 --> 01:26:44.679]  So I hope to see you there.
[01:26:44.679 --> 01:26:47.801]  I'll be giving a speech before each event.
[01:26:47.801 --> 01:26:49.563]  People are asking when the film's going to be out.
[01:26:49.563 --> 01:26:51.924]  It's not going to be out for a month and a half or so.
[01:26:51.924 --> 01:26:55.247]  I've still got to make the cover, make the DVD menu, get it mass-produced.
[01:26:57.481 --> 01:27:00.962]  We are just showing it at the Alamo to really get your feedback.
[01:27:00.962 --> 01:27:08.203]  We might even tweak a few things next week on it after we get your feedback on it.
[01:27:08.203 --> 01:27:14.464]  Oh, there is so much here that I want to go over and also your phone calls.
[01:27:14.464 --> 01:27:15.524]  Tell you what I want to do right now.
[01:27:15.524 --> 01:27:16.585]  Let's just go ahead and take a call.
[01:27:16.585 --> 01:27:20.325]  We'll come back in the long segment and get more into this news.
[01:27:20.325 --> 01:27:21.766]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[01:27:21.766 --> 01:27:23.706]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:27:23.706 --> 01:27:24.126]  Hey Alex.
[01:27:24.668 --> 01:27:32.033]  I just got a membership to the Prison Planet TV, and I was really happy with it.
[01:27:32.033 --> 01:27:37.197]  And I like that picture you drew of Osama Bin Laden.
[01:27:37.197 --> 01:27:40.759]  Maybe you could auction that off on eBay or something.
[01:27:40.759 --> 01:27:45.843]  I think that's in a pile of papers that have already been thrown away, but yeah, that's quite a Picasso, isn't it?
[01:27:45.843 --> 01:27:47.164]  Yeah, it was lovely.
[01:27:47.164 --> 01:27:48.525]  I like the sword.
[01:27:48.525 --> 01:27:50.486]  Hey, yesterday I drew some pictures for people.
[01:27:52.542 --> 01:27:53.442]  I must have missed it.
[01:27:53.442 --> 01:27:59.307]  The technocratic superstructure, advanced technology continuum?
[01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:01.689]  I think I may have caught it.
[01:28:01.689 --> 01:28:08.974]  What I wanted to ask you was, I've been talking to people in my family, and some of them are pretty influential.
[01:28:08.974 --> 01:28:13.898]  I have an uncle who's the CEO of a company, he's just written a book.
[01:28:13.898 --> 01:28:15.359]  Well done, Lord Vader!
[01:28:17.495 --> 01:28:25.302]  He likes a lot of the, um, a lot of the things I tell about the show, and, um, I want you to also pose a question of Burmese, also, later.
[01:28:25.302 --> 01:28:28.224]  Um, what... Lord of Burmese?
[01:28:28.224 --> 01:28:32.367]  Uh, what would he say was some of, maybe, the most compelling?
[01:28:32.367 --> 01:28:42.516]  Because when I talk to these people, you know, anyone in general, and I try to give this information out, what are kind of the most compelling points he, you know, he'd make about 9-11?
[01:28:42.516 --> 01:28:46.259]  And then, you know, kind of... Well, I would give him Terror Storm.
[01:28:47.613 --> 01:28:51.876]  And, uh, I mean, I really think that's the best film on government-sponsored terror.
[01:28:51.876 --> 01:28:59.201]  The best way to convince somebody is to show them that the government's been caught over and over again admitting, and that other governments do it, too, staging terror.
[01:28:59.201 --> 01:29:00.922]  You see, then you've already won the argument.
[01:29:00.922 --> 01:29:02.083]  Well, wait, they've done it before.
[01:29:02.083 --> 01:29:03.523]  Well, wait, they've got the motive.
[01:29:03.523 --> 01:29:08.146]  Well, wait, the government wrote memos and Pentagon documents saying they wanted to stage more attacks.
[01:29:08.146 --> 01:29:09.047]  And then you've got them.
[01:29:09.047 --> 01:29:10.168]  And then you go into the evidence.
[01:29:10.168 --> 01:29:11.929]  That's the most effective.
[01:29:11.929 --> 01:29:12.189]  Right.
[01:29:12.189 --> 01:29:16.652]  Instead, the Pentagon's hiring people to run around in Hitler mustaches, screaming and yelling and
[01:29:17.541 --> 01:29:19.902]  Uh, you know, putting it on Howard Stern, so.
[01:29:19.902 --> 01:29:23.744]  Trying to make people think that's who we are, but it's gonna fall flat on its face, too.
[01:29:23.744 --> 01:29:25.045]  Anything else, sir?
[01:29:25.045 --> 01:29:32.628]  Yeah, uh, with, uh, when I gave, told him, because he's in pharmaceuticals, I said the word eugenics, he said, oh, that's a real politically loaded word.
[01:29:32.628 --> 01:29:36.170]  Uh, how do you- Stay there, we'll talk more about it on the other side.
[01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:41.392]  Stand by, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:41.392 --> 01:29:42.773]  We're on the march.
[01:29:42.773 --> 01:29:44.274]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.285 --> 01:29:51.634]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.634 --> 01:29:54.138]  It is a big idea.
[01:29:54.138 --> 01:29:56.842]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:29:57.702 --> 01:30:00.765]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:30:00.765 --> 01:30:03.607]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:06.389]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:30:06.389 --> 01:30:09.572]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:30:09.572 --> 01:30:16.898]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:30:19.909 --> 01:30:25.351]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:30:25.351 --> 01:30:29.232]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:30:29.232 --> 01:30:31.793]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:30:31.793 --> 01:30:32.954]  Most people have no idea.
[01:30:32.954 --> 01:30:33.754]  They're not after money.
[01:30:33.754 --> 01:30:35.015]  They have all the money they need.
[01:30:35.015 --> 01:30:35.995]  They're after power.
[01:30:35.995 --> 01:30:37.155]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:30:42.918 --> 01:30:53.029]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:30:53.029 --> 01:30:59.275]  I've been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[01:31:00.376 --> 01:31:05.978]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with this.
[01:31:05.978 --> 01:31:12.900]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:19.522]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter, and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[01:31:20.325 --> 01:31:21.906]  Remember our trade deficit?
[01:31:21.906 --> 01:31:27.750]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:34.154]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[01:31:34.154 --> 01:31:35.615]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.

[01:31:50.605 --> 01:31:53.568]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[01:31:53.568 --> 01:31:57.312]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[01:31:57.312 --> 01:32:01.095]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[01:32:01.095 --> 01:32:08.162]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[01:32:08.522 --> 01:32:12.064]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[01:32:12.064 --> 01:32:16.246]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[01:32:16.246 --> 01:32:27.331]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[01:32:27.651 --> 01:32:32.174]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[01:32:32.174 --> 01:32:34.296]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?
[01:32:34.296 --> 01:32:40.900]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:44.383]  Learn, help, shop at hempusa.org.
[01:32:44.383 --> 01:32:45.504]  We do not charge for shipping.
[01:32:45.504 --> 01:32:46.664]  That's 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[01:33:17.505 --> 01:33:22.449]  Okay, we're gonna go back to the caller, then Burmess is gonna pop in for a moment.
[01:33:22.449 --> 01:33:23.550]  We got Jim Tucker coming up.
[01:33:23.550 --> 01:33:25.532]  Ton of news I haven't gotten to yet, and I mean a ton.
[01:33:25.532 --> 01:33:27.633]  I've got three huge stacks here.
[01:33:27.633 --> 01:33:31.296]  The reason I don't usually cover but about 10% of it is you can't do justice to any of it.
[01:33:31.296 --> 01:33:35.360]  I don't even want to mention that they're training police coast to coast to look for roadside bombs.
[01:33:36.261 --> 01:33:39.183]  Without getting into the fact that that's meant to train them to federalize.
[01:33:39.183 --> 01:33:55.754]  That's the cover story for having the military come in and then why I know that and the whole history of that and how I got their secret documents there because an idiot FBI agent gave us the classified ones on I-35 when they were running a takeover drill in Belton instead of the public release.
[01:33:55.754 --> 01:33:57.015]  They got so mad about that.
[01:33:57.355 --> 01:34:00.399]  That's on the web and in my film, Police Day 2, The Takeover.
[01:34:00.399 --> 01:34:08.468]  But right now, going back briefly here, just to finish up with Chris in Florida, you had one other point you wanted to make?
[01:34:08.468 --> 01:34:16.999]  Yeah, I guess most distinctly, how would you sum up that eugenics was the umbrella science that everything sort of grew up around?
[01:34:17.518 --> 01:34:22.520]  Well, notice he said, well, that's kind of a politically charged term.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:25.682]  See, that's kind of out of control, you know.
[01:34:25.682 --> 01:34:28.563]  Fascism.
[01:34:28.563 --> 01:34:31.004]  Yeah, I mean, that's what's always said about it.
[01:34:31.004 --> 01:34:33.245]  Well, people aren't being reasonable about eugenics.
[01:34:33.245 --> 01:34:35.506]  I mean, there's some good things about it.
[01:34:35.506 --> 01:34:38.647]  That's kind of the attitude that comes out of the establishment.
[01:34:38.647 --> 01:34:39.428]  It's simple.
[01:34:39.428 --> 01:34:42.229]  Darwin and his cousins are Francis Galton.
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:52.128]  They developed the idea of the theory of social Darwinism, that the elite killing us, murdering us, enslaving us is good because it's survival of the fittest.
[01:34:52.128 --> 01:34:56.011]  They're making us stronger by doing it and getting rid of the useless eaters.
[01:34:56.011 --> 01:35:01.176]  That's a Hitler quote that he got from, of course, the eugenicists that came before him.
[01:35:01.176 --> 01:35:06.020]  And then when you look at the heads of all the major modern sciences, you look at what
[01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:09.950]  I mean, Sir Francis Galton, no doubt, had like 180 IQ.
[01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:15.895]  The guy, before they were even doing IQs, I mean, the guy did develop something like 20 sciences.
[01:35:15.895 --> 01:35:17.516]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:35:17.516 --> 01:35:19.438]  Major branches.
[01:35:20.194 --> 01:35:20.615]  I think so.
[01:35:39.597 --> 01:35:40.237]  I don't think so.
[01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:02.371]  You look at the beginnings of computers.
[01:36:02.371 --> 01:36:04.793]  The founder of the modern computer, Thomas Watson.
[01:36:04.793 --> 01:36:06.514]  You look at the founders of the human genome.
[01:36:06.514 --> 01:36:11.779]  I mean, it's right there out of the Cold Springs Harbor, with the former top eugenics scientist running the human genome.
[01:36:11.779 --> 01:36:15.522]  Remember having to quit last year, saying blacks weren't human, basically.
[01:36:15.522 --> 01:36:18.404]  Another Mr. Watson, not related to Thomas Watson of IBM.
[01:36:18.404 --> 01:36:22.007]  And then you find out that Prince Philip, Ted Turner, their mommy, their daddy, their grandpa,
[01:36:22.307 --> 01:36:22.727]  We're good to go.
[01:36:41.375 --> 01:36:48.299]  The royalty and the international banking cartels bought into this when it was rockstar popular, the law in the U.S.
[01:36:48.299 --> 01:36:51.261]  to sterilize and kill babies and everything else you can imagine.
[01:36:51.261 --> 01:36:52.182]  They adopted it.
[01:36:52.182 --> 01:36:55.043]  That was only 70, 80 years ago, and it's total heyday.
[01:36:55.043 --> 01:36:55.323]  I guess 60.
[01:36:55.323 --> 01:36:57.425]  We're talking about World War II.
[01:36:57.425 --> 01:36:59.886]  And when it kind of got in trouble publicly.
[01:36:59.886 --> 01:37:03.208]  And so all the institutions were set up along these lines.
[01:37:03.208 --> 01:37:04.609]  The institutions were set up
[01:37:05.530 --> 01:37:07.072]  Uh, to do this and carry this out.
[01:37:07.072 --> 01:37:09.234]  So, endgame covers it.
[01:37:09.234 --> 01:37:12.978]  Uh, and as shocking as endgame is, it isn't one inch down the well.
[01:37:12.978 --> 01:37:17.424]  I mean, the rabbit hole is so deep that it would just blow your mind.
[01:37:17.424 --> 01:37:22.349]  And it takes intense, I mean, we've read scores of books here, research, sent off for university letters.
[01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:29.112]  Spent sometimes 18 hours freaking out looking at it all and then we you can't even put it in a film It's so horrible.
[01:37:29.112 --> 01:37:48.077]  You can't even and now they're the now they turn to the transhumanist and they say it's eugenics and they're gonna force us to have chips and they're gonna Micromanage us and remote control us and they say it that it's official government policy to do it and it doesn't matter the simcom guys will just giggle and snicker as they listen and then help implement it them first because they'll make us because they had to do it and
[01:37:48.778 --> 01:37:50.780]  I mean, it's everything, sir.
[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:53.162]  It's what drives them, it's what they believe in.
[01:37:53.162 --> 01:38:02.652]  It's a... 800 years ago in ancient England, or in the city of Paris, you know, the King of Paris, the King of France, as he was known, had a very small area, actually, really.
[01:38:02.652 --> 01:38:03.914]  I digress, it doesn't matter.
[01:38:03.914 --> 01:38:06.717]  Germany wasn't unified until Bismarck, France right before that, but...
[01:38:08.467 --> 01:38:09.948]  Yeah, I digress into history.
[01:38:09.948 --> 01:38:18.172]  Knowledge is like endless hauls of data, and then once you start down one, you go to another, then how they all interconnect and how it all goes together.
[01:38:18.172 --> 01:38:21.594]  800 years ago, 1,000 years ago, 2,300 years ago with Plato and the Republic,
[01:38:26.577 --> 01:38:31.519]  He said, we're going to have a suboid mass that we breed to be dumb and servile, that we'll control.
[01:38:31.519 --> 01:38:38.603]  And that if we get better machines, we can exterminate them, because... And he like, foresaw large mechanical devices in factories.
[01:38:38.603 --> 01:38:42.264]  I mean, these are geniuses, but very cold and very evil.
[01:38:42.264 --> 01:38:47.187]  And he said, we won't even need as many of the slaves then, or we can just kill them out.
[01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:51.669]  And he coined the term eugenics, meaning eternal youth.
[01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:54.230]  Or the gods, man becoming Mount Olympus.
[01:38:55.318 --> 01:38:56.719]  Uh, that's what it is.
[01:38:56.719 --> 01:38:58.099]  Eternal youth means godhood.
[01:38:58.099 --> 01:38:58.840]  You know, they don't die.
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:00.140]  Gods don't die.
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:01.021]  They can create.
[01:39:01.021 --> 01:39:02.521]  You know, that's why they want genetic engineering.
[01:39:02.521 --> 01:39:04.122]  It's all about playing God.
[01:39:04.122 --> 01:39:06.003]  Put yourself in that mindset.
[01:39:06.003 --> 01:39:08.904]  And then, you know, the nobles knew how to control populations.
[01:39:08.904 --> 01:39:18.028]  They would keep the population on 5-10% of the land, starving at subsistence level, a foot and a half shorter from malnutrition generationally than the elites, riding around on their horses all clean.
[01:39:18.428 --> 01:39:20.810]  Laughing at the peasants with vomit down the front of them.
[01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:27.395]  Starving to death with, you know, a third of their children born from in utero retardation from lack of nourishment.
[01:39:27.395 --> 01:39:29.316]  They have that same problem in many rural areas of China.
[01:39:29.316 --> 01:39:31.098]  A third of the kids are retarded.
[01:39:31.098 --> 01:39:34.220]  You know, just enjoying riding by all the poor retarded people.
[01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:36.462]  And while they would... That was their enjoyment.
[01:39:36.462 --> 01:39:37.823]  I mutate you.
[01:39:37.823 --> 01:39:39.264]  I starve you.
[01:39:39.264 --> 01:39:40.425]  I control.
[01:39:40.425 --> 01:39:42.366]  And then that's their mode to keep their control.
[01:39:42.366 --> 01:39:43.447]  Only they could have bows.
[01:39:43.447 --> 01:39:44.608]  Only they could have knives.
[01:39:44.608 --> 01:39:46.009]  Only they could have swords and shields.
[01:39:46.670 --> 01:39:48.111]  Uh, they were a different species.
[01:39:48.111 --> 01:39:50.133]  See, they thought that a thousand years ago.
[01:39:50.133 --> 01:39:54.218]  Plato thought that 2,350-something years ago.
[01:39:54.218 --> 01:39:55.700]  And so, this is their philosophy.
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:56.781]  This is their idea.
[01:39:56.781 --> 01:39:57.802]  This is their power trip.
[01:39:57.802 --> 01:39:59.604]  This is their looking down their nose at you.
[01:39:59.604 --> 01:40:00.485]  This is who they are.
[01:40:00.485 --> 01:40:01.566]  This is what they do.
[01:40:01.566 --> 01:40:02.027]  You understand?
[01:40:04.150 --> 01:40:04.991]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[01:40:04.991 --> 01:40:06.011]  Appreciate it.
[01:40:06.011 --> 01:40:07.292]  Okay, let's shift gears.
[01:40:07.292 --> 01:40:11.696]  I don't want to give these disinfo Pentagon operatives, and they are folks.
[01:40:11.696 --> 01:40:13.277]  I've met them, I've run into them.
[01:40:13.277 --> 01:40:18.141]  Some of them are camp follower, useful idiot mockingbirds that magnify what's being said.
[01:40:18.141 --> 01:40:24.926]  And when you go on their site, it's all 1st Battalion fighting the chickens.
[01:40:24.926 --> 01:40:27.248]  We're fighting the anti-American Al-Qaeda supporters.
[01:40:27.968 --> 01:40:33.152]  Uh, and we've tracked a lot of their handles, other guys that attack us on Digg and our own message boards.
[01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:34.593]  They'll even put out their own Myspace.
[01:40:34.593 --> 01:40:36.575]  You go to it, it's them in their uniform.
[01:40:36.575 --> 01:40:38.516]  You see the PSYOP patch with the skull.
[01:40:38.516 --> 01:40:39.477]  They're bragging.
[01:40:39.477 --> 01:40:41.078]  I mean, they're not even good.
[01:40:41.078 --> 01:40:46.582]  I mean, I guess the government's so arrogant that, and they've put so many idiots into PSYOPs that they don't understand.
[01:40:46.582 --> 01:40:51.466]  You lose all your effect when you go out and admit you're with PSYOPs, you dummies.
[01:40:51.466 --> 01:40:54.368]  And, I mean, it's, but again, some of you are just camp followers.
[01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:58.281]  And you see them posting... Where's that printout you had in here?
[01:40:58.281 --> 01:41:00.083]  Oh, here it is.
[01:41:00.083 --> 01:41:00.965]  And he was on the...
[01:41:04.585 --> 01:41:21.869]  On the Pentagon website last night, the disinfo site, lavishloosechange.com or whatever it is, Corkscrew Loose Change, and Burmese was on the site, and he goes, look at this, and he linked through over to the James Randi Educational Foundation, where they debunk everything, but don't really debunk it.
[01:41:21.869 --> 01:41:29.351]  It's actually Lord High Protectorville, you know, where they deny China takes organs, and they deny there's mercury in vaccines, while the government admits it.
[01:41:29.671 --> 01:41:29.931]  Sure thing.
[01:41:29.931 --> 01:41:31.552]  The guy starts out saying, okay, this sounds like fun.
[01:41:58.047 --> 01:41:59.988]  I had to get a medical checkup today.
[01:41:59.988 --> 01:42:06.212]  I was not due for a physical for another five years, but for some reason had to go in right away, they said.
[01:42:06.212 --> 01:42:09.554]  Go now and pick up your medical records.
[01:42:09.554 --> 01:42:11.135]  Head to the medical center.
[01:42:11.135 --> 01:42:11.535]  I do.
[01:42:11.535 --> 01:42:18.779]  I get checked out head to toe, and after I pass, they stamp this on my medical records, and it's posted over there, but you can see it.
[01:42:18.779 --> 01:42:19.619]  RFID.
[01:42:19.619 --> 01:42:20.380]  Big letters.
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:21.140]  Okay?
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:22.061]  I'm getting chipped.
[01:42:22.862 --> 01:42:25.984]  I got selected for the 1% of combat troops in my division.
[01:42:25.984 --> 01:42:26.965]  By the way, that's disinfo.
[01:42:26.965 --> 01:42:30.126]  They always claim your city's been chosen for Delta Force training.
[01:42:30.126 --> 01:42:32.408]  Your city's been trained for bomb disposal.
[01:42:32.408 --> 01:42:33.549]  You're the first.
[01:42:33.549 --> 01:42:34.349]  You're the only one.
[01:42:34.349 --> 01:42:36.070]  Uh, no buffoon.
[01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:39.792]  Officers, many officers in select categories got chips five years ago.
[01:42:39.792 --> 01:42:40.153]  Go ahead.
[01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:40.853]  Yeah.
[01:42:40.853 --> 01:42:46.176]  And he says to get one to monitor quote-unquote stress patterns, Alex, for upcoming deployment.
[01:42:46.176 --> 01:42:47.397]  Now, I just want to stop right there.
[01:42:48.027 --> 01:42:52.491]  Remember, chips were only supposed to have an ID number that if they scanned it, then there'd be a database.
[01:42:52.491 --> 01:42:54.693]  Well, this chip somehow reads stress patterns.
[01:42:54.693 --> 01:42:56.535]  Isn't that just amazing, Alex?
[01:42:56.535 --> 01:42:58.436]  It's not just a number anymore.
[01:42:58.436 --> 01:43:02.960]  So he goes on and he says, So I have a date when it goes in, but no date when it comes out.
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:10.847]  I don't want to say this, this is for nefarious purposes, but I don't see any reason to have this in me because I'm not deployed for another nine to ten months.
[01:43:10.847 --> 01:43:12.248]  Congrats, Moonbats.
[01:43:12.248 --> 01:43:13.750]  You were right about something for once.
[01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:16.631]  Oh yeah.
[01:43:16.631 --> 01:43:20.912]  But then they go on the Randy forum and say we're still bad, not to like it.
[01:43:20.912 --> 01:43:24.033]  Yeah, well the funny thing is that a couple of them are pretty disgusted.
[01:43:24.033 --> 01:43:27.494]  They can't even believe that, you know, this guy's actually getting chipped and they ask him about it.
[01:43:27.494 --> 01:43:28.814]  They say, well, why don't you refuse?
[01:43:28.814 --> 01:43:30.595]  And he's just like, he toes the line.
[01:43:30.595 --> 01:43:32.476]  Well, I lose my military career.
[01:43:32.476 --> 01:43:33.856]  That's disobeying a lawful order.
[01:43:34.316 --> 01:43:36.076]  No, you're now known as a jackass.
[01:43:36.076 --> 01:43:38.337]  They're going to do more to you, you stupid guinea pig.
[01:43:38.337 --> 01:43:39.537]  Absolutely.
[01:43:39.537 --> 01:43:43.798]  And they got wind of this and they're like, oh well, now they're going to talk about cyborgs.
[01:43:43.798 --> 01:43:46.939]  Listen, the chip has been implemented for over a decade.
[01:43:46.939 --> 01:43:48.359]  They do have brain chips.
[01:43:48.359 --> 01:43:51.120]  All you have to do is look up blind can see now.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:56.441]  And they have it set up so they put a chip in your brain and they hook it up to a small camera where your iris is.
[01:43:56.441 --> 01:43:57.922]  And see, that's all fine and dandy.
[01:43:57.922 --> 01:44:01.402]  The point is, the Pentagon reports, and we have a list of them.
[01:44:01.402 --> 01:44:02.223]  I put it in my book.
[01:44:02.223 --> 01:44:03.423]  It was in Wired today.
[01:44:04.123 --> 01:44:04.984]  Which is a whitewash.
[01:44:04.984 --> 01:44:06.205]  You go read the actual reports.
[01:44:06.205 --> 01:44:09.507]  It says that they're going to make the military take brain chips.
[01:44:09.507 --> 01:44:10.628]  Yeah.
[01:44:10.628 --> 01:44:15.232]  And we told you dummies they were going to first put one under your skin, then it was going to get more advanced.
[01:44:15.232 --> 01:44:24.359]  We've played the top futurist, you know, the top marshal, the head futurist, like 90 years old, the Pentagon, says they're going to put you on drugs, remote control you.
[01:44:24.359 --> 01:44:25.700]  I mean, I'm not the one, guys.
[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:28.522]  I'm sorry that reality is dawning for you.
[01:44:29.182 --> 01:44:34.667]  And, uh, that this is all happening, but, uh, we only cover the facts here.
[01:44:34.667 --> 01:44:40.932]  And no amount of black propaganda with your buddies running around in Hitler mustaches claiming to be us is gonna help you.
[01:44:40.932 --> 01:44:54.443]  Yeah, I think the two major points that should dissuade anybody from being pro-RFID under the skin are the fact that the Jacobs family went on the Today Show right after 9-11, said, oh, we're taking government ships, it's so great!
[01:44:54.443 --> 01:44:56.265]  But it turned out they really worked for the company.
[01:44:56.305 --> 01:44:57.887]  Yeah, they got a huge bonus.
[01:44:57.887 --> 01:44:59.088]  But they didn't say that on the news.
[01:44:59.088 --> 01:45:01.331]  Oh, of course not.
[01:45:01.331 --> 01:45:02.672]  They signed a huge contract.
[01:45:02.672 --> 01:45:07.518]  And then the second thing is that Dobbs, back in December... Well, the weird thing is the kid died hitting a light pole.
[01:45:07.518 --> 01:45:09.019]  Yeah, on a motorcycle accident.
[01:45:09.019 --> 01:45:09.840]  That is kind of bizarre.
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:11.162]  A little goblin.
[01:45:11.162 --> 01:45:11.322]  Well...
[01:45:11.522 --> 01:45:12.562]  You know, I feel bad for everybody.
[01:45:12.562 --> 01:45:13.323]  It's a conspiracy.
[01:45:13.323 --> 01:45:17.404]  Yeah, no, I'm just saying, you know, they took chips as a family on TV because of terrorism.
[01:45:17.404 --> 01:45:20.245]  But they were the ugliest looking little family I've ever seen in my life.
[01:45:20.245 --> 01:45:21.025]  Alright, alright.
[01:45:21.025 --> 01:45:23.285]  Well, they really were little demonic pods.
[01:45:23.285 --> 01:45:34.909]  Well, I think what's scarier now, Alex, is that the Mexican government is actually announcing that they want to do away with passports for people who live in Guatemala and south of Mexico, and they just want to chip people.
[01:45:34.909 --> 01:45:37.670]  They're saying, well, if you want to come into Mexico now legally, you're going to be chipped.
[01:45:37.670 --> 01:45:38.770]  No, I know, and then...
[01:45:39.548 --> 01:45:43.010]  That was mainstream news, and then the Mexican Attorney General made his employees take it.
[01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.310]  U.S.
[01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:44.570]  companies are making them take it.
[01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:49.032]  I had the police chief of Bergen County on, and then I was getting an email going, there's not police chiefs of counties.
[01:45:49.032 --> 01:45:50.693]  There is a New Jersey, Jack.
[01:45:50.693 --> 01:45:53.794]  I had him on, and he goes, yes, I will make everyone take chips.
[01:45:53.794 --> 01:45:56.135]  He says, I can't wait to make everyone take chips.
[01:45:56.135 --> 01:46:06.840]  Yeah, and the Mexican Attorney General thing you're talking about is back in 2004, four years ago, and 144 of his employees took it for quote-unquote security purposes.
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:07.500]  And that was the first
[01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:09.846]  They just said take it or leave your job.
[01:46:09.846 --> 01:46:11.750]  These are all PSYOP tests, you dummies.
[01:46:12.839 --> 01:46:13.099]  Yeah.
[01:46:13.099 --> 01:46:16.101]  I mean, I, you know, I'm just, I feel so sorry for these guys.
[01:46:16.101 --> 01:46:16.561]  Yeah.
[01:46:16.561 --> 01:46:20.603]  But I was reading the comments in there this morning and it's, you know, people going, oh, it's good.
[01:46:20.603 --> 01:46:21.923]  I mean, come on.
[01:46:21.923 --> 01:46:28.947]  Well, you know, on top of all of everything we just talked about of the control modes and the fact that RFIDs aren't our friend, they cause cancer, Alex.
[01:46:28.947 --> 01:46:31.888]  Last year they did a study, they found it caused cancer in rats.
[01:46:31.888 --> 01:46:39.852]  Of course, having an RFID tag under your skin that omits a radio frequency, folk, is going to cause cancer.
[01:46:39.872 --> 01:46:42.995]  Well, they're going to argue that it's only when it gets pinged that it does it do that.
[01:46:42.995 --> 01:46:44.837]  But, I mean, here's an example.
[01:46:44.837 --> 01:46:47.299]  They put up radio readers all over the country that are standardized.
[01:46:47.299 --> 01:46:52.885]  They call it K-Tag, Texas Tag, Smart Tag, you know, any little Pavlovian term they give the idiots.
[01:46:52.885 --> 01:47:01.734]  But then they admit, and it's come out, and I read it in the Pentagon Documents first, who designed all this, and then later it's in the news as they introduced it to slaves, that they're reading them all over this country.
[01:47:01.734 --> 01:47:02.775]  They've got readers everywhere.
[01:47:03.268 --> 01:47:05.389]  And so they know your name and they're tracking you.
[01:47:05.389 --> 01:47:11.831]  I told everybody that they had whole floors of every phone company was NSA because I read it in the Telecommunications Act.
[01:47:11.831 --> 01:47:13.312]  Now it came out last year.
[01:47:13.312 --> 01:47:15.772]  I told everybody they're tracking your cell phone even when it's off.
[01:47:15.772 --> 01:47:21.574]  Now they're flipping them on to emergency management centers where the cops type your name in and real-time your phone comes up.
[01:47:21.574 --> 01:47:22.735]  All designed for control.
[01:47:23.195 --> 01:47:28.116]  And it turns out when they were developing cell phones in the 70s, they knew that it gave all the rats cancer.
[01:47:28.116 --> 01:47:35.317]  Now there's hundreds of university studies where you get a massive increase fold in a rare tumor right where the cell phone's at.
[01:47:35.317 --> 01:47:37.577]  And they call it conspiracy theories there.
[01:47:37.577 --> 01:47:39.638]  The Randy Foundation says that too.
[01:47:39.638 --> 01:47:41.118]  Just everything's a lie.
[01:47:41.118 --> 01:47:48.299]  Just everything we say, the government loves you, everything's fine, the government never lies, they're never bad, you can trust them.
[01:47:48.299 --> 01:47:52.500]  And then meanwhile in Florida, you're going to get five to ten years in prison for speeding.
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:54.200]  Yeah, yeah, that's that's the way it is.
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:57.041]  I mean, if you don't understand RFIDs are a total mode of control.
[01:47:57.041 --> 01:47:58.341]  It's to make you a product.
[01:47:58.341 --> 01:48:00.522]  It's to make you something that's on a shelf at Walmart.
[01:48:00.522 --> 01:48:01.322]  Well, it's more than that.
[01:48:01.322 --> 01:48:08.344]  The Pentagon, who developed them at MIT, was actually developed for proximity detonators in World War II.
[01:48:08.344 --> 01:48:16.006]  That's why the flak, the shells, wouldn't blow up our planes, but would, you know, destroy their planes whenever they were, you know, during the Battle of Britain and the rest of it.
[01:48:16.006 --> 01:48:17.566]  They already had it implemented.
[01:48:17.566 --> 01:48:21.007]  But the smaller RFID that was smaller than a
[01:48:23.686 --> 01:48:26.747]  You know, a grain of sand, but much smaller.
[01:48:26.747 --> 01:48:28.068]  They had that a decade ago.
[01:48:28.068 --> 01:48:29.628]  Hitachi's got it.
[01:48:29.628 --> 01:48:35.950]  And they say that all real products will be like in cyberspace, where they can Google where that tin can was.
[01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:37.411]  Or they can Google that battery.
[01:48:37.411 --> 01:48:51.276]  So when the battery falls out of your toy, and it's in your backyard, they can come give you five years for the, and folks, it's already happening, five years for that battery, because they were able to scan that that battery was in your backyard.
[01:48:51.896 --> 01:48:52.897]  Oh, how lovely.
[01:48:52.897 --> 01:49:07.554]  Oh yeah, when your insurance is out, they're already scanning your license plates, and Texas almost passed us the last two legislative sessions in the last four years, where the minute your insurance is out, they're going to arrest you.
[01:49:07.554 --> 01:49:08.415]  Oh, great.
[01:49:08.415 --> 01:49:11.239]  But the police have been ordered to leave the illegals alone, though.
[01:49:11.239 --> 01:49:12.400]  It's all selectively enforced.
[01:49:12.961 --> 01:49:13.921]  Like everything.
[01:49:13.921 --> 01:49:18.043]  And I told you they'd put face scanners in to, quote, stop liquor and cigarettes for kids.
[01:49:18.043 --> 01:49:22.524]  Now AP, now other papers are reporting that, yes, it's going in.
[01:49:22.524 --> 01:49:28.746]  Well, you know, face scanners, biometrics, thumb scanners, all that stuff is on the forefront.
[01:49:28.746 --> 01:49:29.046]  It's coming.
[01:49:29.046 --> 01:49:32.747]  Well, the Pentagon said it was to control you, and they call it a total control grid.
[01:49:33.283 --> 01:49:34.323]  They call it a grid.
[01:49:34.323 --> 01:49:35.223]  They designed it.
[01:49:35.223 --> 01:49:41.364]  Well, when I talked to Tommy Thompson of, you know, the Ex Head of Health and Human Services about this, he really tried to marginalize it.
[01:49:41.364 --> 01:49:45.225]  And he said, oh, well, it's great for keeping track of inventory.
[01:49:45.225 --> 01:49:48.126]  Now, inventory to me is a code word for people and soldiers.
[01:49:48.126 --> 01:49:49.766]  But then he said he wouldn't take a chip.
[01:49:49.766 --> 01:50:00.608]  Yeah, well, the first thing I prefaced it with was, well, you went on TV back in 2005, and you were on all these shows saying you were going to take one of these chips from Verichip, with a company that you were working for, essentially.
[01:50:00.988 --> 01:50:02.870]  And he's like, well, first of all, I didn't take a chip.
[01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:04.451]  It wasn't essentially, he was on the payroll.
[01:50:04.451 --> 01:50:05.192]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:50:05.192 --> 01:50:06.173]  He was on the board, wasn't he?
[01:50:06.173 --> 01:50:06.433]  Yeah.
[01:50:06.433 --> 01:50:07.173]  Yeah, he was on the board.
[01:50:07.173 --> 01:50:09.415]  And I think that was while he was the head of Health and Human Services.
[01:50:09.415 --> 01:50:10.997]  But see, Tommy Thompson doesn't exist.
[01:50:10.997 --> 01:50:15.661]  And that national trip to hundreds of high schools saying, get chips, that didn't exist either.
[01:50:15.661 --> 01:50:16.341]  Yeah, the whole chip thing.
[01:50:16.341 --> 01:50:23.427]  Yeah, there's not a program to recruit the preachers for Homeland Security to tell their flocks to turn their guns in, though it's admitted, a year after I reported it.
[01:50:23.427 --> 01:50:26.010]  There's no program to tell kids to take chips, even though it's going on.
[01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:29.773]  Look, the crazy thing is you can go on eBay and you can get a whole kit for about $10.
[01:50:29.773 --> 01:50:31.134]  That reads it.
[01:50:31.134 --> 01:50:35.638]  Yeah, and then you can sign up for a program where basically you're a dog and you can locate yourself everywhere.
[01:50:35.638 --> 01:50:36.239]  You hear that, parents?
[01:50:36.239 --> 01:50:39.462]  You can ship your kids right now if you'd like to for $15 on eBay.
[01:50:39.462 --> 01:50:41.183]  But you're criticizing and so it doesn't exist.
[01:50:41.183 --> 01:50:41.984]  You're crazy.
[01:50:41.984 --> 01:50:42.965]  Get out of here, Moonbat.
[01:50:42.965 --> 01:50:43.566]  Alright, later on.
[01:50:43.566 --> 01:50:43.986]  Get out of here.
[01:50:43.986 --> 01:50:45.748]  It doesn't exist.
[01:50:45.748 --> 01:50:48.250]  And neither does all the government-sponsored terror that they've declassified.
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:54.142]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:50:54.142 --> 01:50:55.704]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:50:55.704 --> 01:50:57.866]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:57.866 --> 01:50:59.767]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:50:59.767 --> 01:51:01.248]  The late great USA.
[01:51:01.248 --> 01:51:03.010]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:51:37.679 --> 01:51:41.501]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:51:41.501 --> 01:51:47.243]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:51:47.243 --> 01:51:49.204]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:52:50.282 --> 01:52:53.544]  The election cycle draws near, and we don't have much time left.
[01:52:53.544 --> 01:53:00.429]  If the American people truly hope to make a change in Washington, then we must act now with a cohesive plan for taking back our government.
[01:53:00.429 --> 01:53:04.832]  Washington, You're Fired is a new patriotic documentary from the director of Beyond Treason.
[01:53:04.832 --> 01:53:13.898]  The video is the result of a two-year endeavor to assemble a video tool for engaging, educating, and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of Congress.
[01:53:14.218 --> 01:53:22.266]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[01:53:22.266 --> 01:53:27.050]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with only two choices.
[01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:29.373]  Be a part of the problem, or be a part of the solution.
[01:53:29.953 --> 01:53:37.803]  Washington You're Fired is being described as the best patriotic video since Freedom to Fascism, and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.

[01:54:03.444 --> 01:54:05.025]  Don't want no shackles.
[01:54:05.025 --> 01:54:06.066]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:54:06.066 --> 01:54:07.046]  Don't want no shackles.
[01:54:07.046 --> 01:54:08.627]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:54:08.627 --> 01:54:09.828]  I sat down with Big Brother.
[01:54:09.828 --> 01:54:10.748]  Don't like those RFIDs.
[01:54:34.073 --> 01:54:39.254]  We've got the federal statistics up on InfoWars.com.
[01:54:39.254 --> 01:54:47.376]  Thousands of times better chance of dying in an automobile accident than you do every year of dying of terrorism, even when the 3,000 deaths of 9-11 are averaged in.
[01:54:47.376 --> 01:54:52.397]  If you believe terrorism really comes from men in caves, that they can run it all, but the government can't.
[01:54:52.397 --> 01:54:53.577]  It's too complex for the government.
[01:54:54.509 --> 01:55:09.098]  Uh, but it is not too complex for the men in caves, uh, that you have a 10-plus time chance to die by hitting a deer that caused you to wreck and kill yourself, uh, than you do, uh, dying by terrorists, and hundreds of times the chance of grounding.
[01:55:09.098 --> 01:55:11.439]  Uh, that doesn't matter, does it?
[01:55:11.439 --> 01:55:15.702]  Because... We've gotta federalize the police.
[01:55:15.702 --> 01:55:17.163]  It was, uh, the day after Thanksgiving,
[01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:23.832]  1998, Mike Hanson did camera work for me, driving along, uh, doing a construction job in Waco.
[01:55:23.832 --> 01:55:27.134]  He's driving through Belton, south of there, and he sees U.S.
[01:55:27.134 --> 01:55:28.114]  Army troops running around.
[01:55:28.114 --> 01:55:29.414]  He was in the Army.
[01:55:29.414 --> 01:55:30.775]  Now, you know, he was thinking, that's strange.
[01:55:30.775 --> 01:55:37.017]  They were searching a Greyhound bus, and he pulls over, and he get in, and the, and police walk up.
[01:55:37.017 --> 01:55:42.139]  Lieutenant Best, and says, turn your camera off, and Mike says, no, it's America.
[01:55:42.139 --> 01:55:43.620]  So they start threatening him on video.
[01:55:46.363 --> 01:55:49.565]  And that goes on and on for a while.
[01:55:49.565 --> 01:55:58.529]  And then they park all these dump trucks in front, but Mike goes ahead and just goes around them and talks to the people who've been waiting nine hours, and it was 12 hours, then went on.
[01:55:58.529 --> 01:56:00.170]  Mike said, you can't stop me from going in Dairy Queen.
[01:56:00.976 --> 01:56:02.336]  But then the cops threatened him to arrest him.
[01:56:02.336 --> 01:56:05.737]  He didn't turn his camera off, so he did do that to go eat, because he was out there for hours.
[01:56:05.737 --> 01:56:06.637]  You know, they're the lordships.
[01:56:06.637 --> 01:56:07.817]  They tell you not to videotape.
[01:56:07.817 --> 01:56:12.778]  And they said, yeah, they just tell us there's a terrorist and a bomb, but then they told the news it was a drill.
[01:56:12.778 --> 01:56:13.618]  And it was a drill.
[01:56:13.618 --> 01:56:21.480]  Turned out, Greyhound was working with them all over the country and letting their unwitting passengers, who tend to be poor, tend to not know what's going on, not be able to defend themselves.
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.760]  Perfect group.
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:24.380]  See, these drills always go live now.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:25.740]  I've got Marines arresting U.S.
[01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:28.461]  citizens in Swanboro, North Carolina, on video.
[01:56:28.461 --> 01:56:29.001]  Quote, a drill.
[01:56:29.938 --> 01:56:31.920]  That goes live with the police.
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:33.601]  That was when they were getting rid of Posse Comitatus.
[01:56:33.601 --> 01:56:37.744]  We told you they were, and you said it was a conspiracy theory, and now they've announced they've gotten rid of it.
[01:56:37.744 --> 01:56:45.710]  We're always right, but again, I guess the debunkers will just say that they didn't get rid of Posse Comitatus when they did, but then you'll say they did, but it's good.
[01:56:45.710 --> 01:56:47.291]  It's called double-thinking, my friends.
[01:56:47.291 --> 01:56:48.131]  Crime stop.
[01:56:48.131 --> 01:56:49.893]  You do it well.
[01:56:49.893 --> 01:56:57.178]  But when you see a story like this, the AP carried, Homeland Security to train cops to combat roadside bombs.
[01:56:57.771 --> 01:56:58.031]  The U.S.
[01:56:58.031 --> 01:57:05.874]  Department of Homeland Security is holding a workshop in Fayetteville to teach local law enforcement agencies how to handle roadside bombs, reports the AP.
[01:57:05.874 --> 01:57:08.335]  No, not in Iraq, but here in America.
[01:57:08.335 --> 01:57:12.936]  Now, it says the Department's Office of Bomb Prevention will host Tuesday's workshop.
[01:57:12.936 --> 01:57:20.639]  Now, the FBI pulled up to threaten Mike in Belton after about two hours and said, look, here's a press release, get out of here.
[01:57:21.331 --> 01:57:33.053]  Well, he gave us a press release on top, and then under it was a classified not-for-distribution, it's on the website, it's in the film, please stay to the takeover, not-for-distribution internal for police departments.
[01:57:33.053 --> 01:57:47.596]  And it said, uh, bomb disposal is a cover for a covert, uh, military assistance program in 77 counties, warrant service, arrest, apprehension, uh, it just lists just scores of things.
[01:57:48.334 --> 01:57:51.018]  And says it's a huge secret covert program with the U.S.
[01:57:51.018 --> 01:57:55.083]  Army out of Fort Hood, 77 counties, Rapid Reaction Force.
[01:57:55.083 --> 01:58:02.093]  And if you need our military to dress in, you know, uniforms that aren't identified, that, you know, because you'll see troops when they're with them.
[01:58:02.093 --> 01:58:03.094]  It won't say police.
[01:58:03.094 --> 01:58:05.838]  It'll be a black uniform just like the police, but
[01:58:06.684 --> 01:58:07.965]  It won't be local.
[01:58:07.965 --> 01:58:08.765]  Criminal.
[01:58:08.765 --> 01:58:09.525]  Secret.
[01:58:09.525 --> 01:58:10.346]  Wicked.
[01:58:10.346 --> 01:58:12.647]  Just like they've been taking your blood for 35 years.
[01:58:12.647 --> 01:58:13.347]  Criminal.
[01:58:13.347 --> 01:58:14.027]  Secret.
[01:58:14.027 --> 01:58:14.668]  Wicked.
[01:58:14.668 --> 01:58:15.328]  At birth.
[01:58:15.328 --> 01:58:19.030]  And now Bush signs an ex- Bill last week making it legal.
[01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.730]  Criminal.
[01:58:19.730 --> 01:58:20.390]  Criminal.
[01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:21.011]  Criminal.
[01:58:21.011 --> 01:58:21.611]  Criminal.
[01:58:21.611 --> 01:58:22.211]  Criminal.
[01:58:22.211 --> 01:58:22.752]  Criminal.
[01:58:22.752 --> 01:58:23.192]  Criminal.
[01:58:23.192 --> 01:58:25.813]  Taking newborn babies' blood for homeland security.
[01:58:25.813 --> 01:58:26.413]  Criminal.
[01:58:26.413 --> 01:58:26.994]  Criminal.
[01:58:26.994 --> 01:58:27.574]  Criminal.
[01:58:27.574 --> 01:58:28.134]  Criminal.
[01:58:28.134 --> 01:58:32.516]  Criminal.

[01:58:45.843 --> 01:58:46.784]  In the near future.
[01:58:47.634 --> 01:58:50.317]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:50.317 --> 01:58:53.541]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[01:58:53.541 --> 01:58:56.324]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[01:58:56.324 --> 01:58:59.507]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.507 --> 01:59:06.836]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:09.861 --> 01:59:15.305]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[01:59:18.607 --> 01:59:21.749]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:21.749 --> 01:59:22.910]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:23.690]  They're not after money.
[01:59:23.690 --> 01:59:24.971]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:24.971 --> 01:59:25.952]  They're after power.
[01:59:25.952 --> 01:59:27.093]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:59:43.822 --> 01:59:44.022]  Yeah.
[01:59:44.022 --> 01:59:46.222]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.222 --> 01:59:55.204]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:55.204 --> 01:59:56.944]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:56.944 --> 01:59:58.524]  You want answers?
[01:59:58.524 --> 01:59:59.464]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:59.464 --> 02:00:04.285]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.285 --> 02:00:08.346]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.501 --> 02:00:21.694]  Yeah, so, it sounds ridiculous when you see an AP headline like Homeland Security to train cops to combat roadside bombs in the U.S.
[02:00:21.694 --> 02:00:23.516]  You think, well, there's no bombing going on.
[02:00:23.516 --> 02:00:28.662]  Well, you know, that's to train the public aide and nanny when they see a paper box blowing around or anything.
[02:00:28.662 --> 02:00:31.245]  Just, men in black uniforms, save me!
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:34.523]  We're going to get Jim Tucker on in the next segment.
[02:00:34.523 --> 02:00:36.284]  In fact, go ahead and get him lined up.
[02:00:36.284 --> 02:00:43.031]  And then we've got this 911 call where this guy's breaking in, attacking this woman, and she calls 911.
[02:00:43.031 --> 02:00:46.815]  And the 911 operator says, I could care less what happens to you.
[02:00:46.815 --> 02:00:48.677]  Starts cussing at her.
[02:00:48.677 --> 02:00:55.944]  And the reason I want to play this is that we're going to play another piece where a gun club was meeting with concealed carry holders and others.
[02:00:56.776 --> 02:01:04.019]  And the police, they always meet at this restaurant, and the police came in and went ahead and took their guns and arrested some of them.
[02:01:04.019 --> 02:01:07.541]  And there's no law, but the cops just said, look, we arrest you for that.
[02:01:07.541 --> 02:01:09.782]  And that's like Texas.
[02:01:09.782 --> 02:01:12.083]  You can walk around with a gun on your hip, but don't try it.
[02:01:12.083 --> 02:01:14.924]  You'll be, the SWAT team will kill you within minutes.
[02:01:14.924 --> 02:01:23.308]  I mean, every few weeks you hear about an apartment complex or neighborhood shut down, and it always turns out later that, you know, it's deer season.
[02:01:23.308 --> 02:01:25.369]  It's really bad during deer season, or it's duck season.
[02:01:26.503 --> 02:01:47.440]  Or it's turkey season, where the guy's going to the range, and I'll never forget when this happened to me, I guess about 15 years ago, I was walking out of my apartment, and my Mustang was parked right outside my apartment, and I went and opened the hatch back up and laid a deer rifle in there, and I went back in the house, was doing something, and five minutes later, a cop pulls up, he's walking around, he's like, have you seen somebody with a gun?
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:50.122]  And I'm like, yeah, I'm going deer hunting.
[02:01:50.122 --> 02:01:52.664]  He's like, okay, we got a report of one, can I see it?
[02:01:52.664 --> 02:01:55.426]  And back then, I was young and dumb, and was like, well, yeah, I hear a man.
[02:01:56.167 --> 02:02:03.052]  That's your country, dude, just filth, trash, chicken neck, weaklings everywhere just shaking in cowardly fear.
[02:02:03.052 --> 02:02:23.987]  And they've got this city council meeting where they're going, I think they should have banned the guns, I think they should have gotten them, and to protest at the gun owners because in that particular state, you know, it's concealed carry open, you can take them in the town hall meeting, and they've got guns there, and the citizens are going, I'm scared they've got guns!
[02:02:23.987 --> 02:02:25.628]  I only want police to have them!
[02:02:27.108 --> 02:02:32.431]  The average, and I haven't looked this up in years, so you can look it up, but you'll find that five, six years ago this was the number.
[02:02:32.431 --> 02:02:33.351]  I haven't looked it up since then.
[02:02:33.351 --> 02:02:37.293]  I want to be careful with statistics because they change, but, in fact, let me just, I can't do it now.
[02:02:37.293 --> 02:02:49.500]  I want you to Google average 9-11 call, national, try this, national average 9-11 call time, or 9-11 response time.
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:51.380]  That should get it, 9-11 response time.
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:56.043]  Find the national average for me, but it used to be 11 and a half minutes, roughly.
[02:02:56.043 --> 02:02:56.163]  Now,
[02:02:56.894 --> 02:02:58.755]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[02:02:58.755 --> 02:03:04.898]  If somebody breaks in my house, upstairs and two places downstairs, I got instant access pistol safes.
[02:03:04.898 --> 02:03:06.139]  I just bam, bam, bam.
[02:03:06.139 --> 02:03:08.260]  It's a five, you know, key.
[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:14.424]  With, you know, pinky once, index once, middle finger twice, you know.
[02:03:14.424 --> 02:03:18.426]  Index again, I'm not giving my actual codes, but they're all different anyways.
[02:03:18.426 --> 02:03:20.787]  The point is, boom, pops open.
[02:03:20.787 --> 02:03:23.609]  And you're dead.
[02:03:24.364 --> 02:03:25.785]  My wife, my children come first.
[02:03:25.785 --> 02:03:29.407]  It's not that I even want to kill you to act tough or have some macho thing.
[02:03:29.407 --> 02:03:31.428]  People that think citizens with guns are like that.
[02:03:31.428 --> 02:03:33.229]  Believe me, I don't want you bleeding all over my house.
[02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:36.071]  I don't want to have to kill you and fill out the paperwork.
[02:03:36.071 --> 02:03:40.273]  But in fact, if you're trying to break in my back door, I'm going to kill you.
[02:03:40.273 --> 02:03:43.915]  I'm going to go into a crouch position and I'm going to shoot you.
[02:03:43.915 --> 02:03:46.517]  And that's just how it works, how the cookie crumbles.
[02:03:46.517 --> 02:03:52.300]  That's because my life comes first, not yours, you drugged out idiot on government narcotics trying to come in my house.
[02:03:53.726 --> 02:03:56.428]  I'm not gonna call 9-1-1.
[02:03:56.428 --> 02:03:57.068]  It's a joke.
[02:03:57.068 --> 02:04:09.397]  I mean, if we had officers on every street corner and I called 9-1-1, that would take 10 seconds to call it, 10 seconds for him to answer, 20 seconds for me to explain I'm at this address and this guy's breaking in.
[02:04:09.397 --> 02:04:18.224]  And then, it would take him a minute to arrive, and a minute to... I mean, 11 and a half minutes is actually pretty fast.
[02:04:18.224 --> 02:04:20.526]  It's just not gonna happen.
[02:04:20.526 --> 02:04:20.886]  If you...
[02:04:23.562 --> 02:04:24.623]  Do that, you're dead.
[02:04:24.623 --> 02:04:33.427]  And that's why Chicago and New York have four, five, six, seven, eight, depending on the year, the crime rates of places like Phoenix, Arizona or Austin, Texas.
[02:04:33.427 --> 02:04:40.371]  Because, uh, you carjack somebody around here, and you come in somebody's house about half the time, they're gonna kill you.
[02:04:40.371 --> 02:04:44.553]  And we got all these cowardly, weak, domesticated people that are scared of us having guns.
[02:04:44.553 --> 02:04:45.834]  Leave the country, scum!
[02:04:48.143 --> 02:05:01.301]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:05:01.301 --> 02:05:05.127]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:05:05.467 --> 02:05:12.348]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:05:12.348 --> 02:05:15.769]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:05:15.769 --> 02:05:17.529]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:05:17.529 --> 02:05:23.651]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:05:48.174 --> 02:05:51.695]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:05:51.695 --> 02:05:57.096]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:05:57.096 --> 02:06:02.237]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:06:02.237 --> 02:06:13.360]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:19.547]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:06:19.547 --> 02:06:25.814]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:06:25.814 --> 02:06:26.856]  What about you?

[02:07:51.441 --> 02:08:02.890]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.890 --> 02:08:05.192]  Old Jim Tucker got his time zones wrong.
[02:08:06.314 --> 02:08:10.067]  You gotta tell him five times.
[02:08:10.067 --> 02:08:12.555]  Reportedly, that's what I'm told, that he was told that, uh...
[02:08:14.421 --> 02:08:15.662]  One o'clock central.
[02:08:15.662 --> 02:08:17.682]  He thought that was one o'clock eastern.
[02:08:17.682 --> 02:08:21.264]  He went to lunch, so he'll probably be on next hour.
[02:08:21.264 --> 02:08:28.647]  Hey, we have four hours now, so when Hosts get their time zones wrong, we got his home number and two office numbers, because I really want to know.
[02:08:28.647 --> 02:08:39.211]  I want to know if Tucker thinks that Bilderberg.org, Tony Gosling, who's always been a good source in the past, that Bilderberg, for the first time in 30-something years, was able to evade us,
[02:08:40.248 --> 02:08:52.111]  Was able to have a meeting without us having representatives there to cover what they were doing and have moles inside at the five-star resorts tell us during and after what they were doing.
[02:08:52.111 --> 02:08:58.452]  This is a very important intelligence gathering for us each year, but this just wets my appetite to find out what Jim thinks.
[02:08:58.452 --> 02:09:03.513]  We also got a call into Estalin, so if it isn't today, it'll be tomorrow!
[02:09:03.513 --> 02:09:07.494]  Ah, the fun we have with time zones, man.
[02:09:09.372 --> 02:09:13.453]  Holy mackerel!
[02:09:13.453 --> 02:09:13.893]  But you know what?
[02:09:13.893 --> 02:09:15.053]  I've got a ton of news I want to cover.
[02:09:15.053 --> 02:09:18.494]  We've got Scott, Dave, Randy, Leo, Kyle, and many, many others.
[02:09:18.494 --> 02:09:25.335]  Let me just cover news right now for a few minutes, and then I will get to your phone calls, okay?
[02:09:25.335 --> 02:09:29.435]  Okay, Homeland Security to train cops to combat roadside bombs in America.
[02:09:29.435 --> 02:09:33.556]  Yes, we've got to spend billions and billions a year in every state.
[02:09:33.556 --> 02:09:36.617]  They put $2 billion in Boston of cameras in a loan to fight Al Qaeda.
[02:09:36.617 --> 02:09:38.577]  Just got to fight that Al Qaeda, man.
[02:09:39.335 --> 02:09:41.197]  Gotta do it.
[02:09:41.197 --> 02:09:44.341]  Could soldiers be prosecuted for thought crime?
[02:09:44.341 --> 02:09:46.843]  When they get their new brain chips, they will be.
[02:09:46.843 --> 02:09:49.947]  Wired Magazine.
[02:09:49.947 --> 02:09:52.249]  And I'm weird for covering it.
[02:09:52.249 --> 02:09:55.953]  Arizona State University test pandemic flu plans.
[02:09:55.953 --> 02:09:59.197]  Mass deaths and control with simulated newscast.
[02:10:00.089 --> 02:10:06.320]  Twelve sets of eyes trained across the dark room, waiting for one of the seven floor-to-ceiling video screens to light up.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:11.410]  Seconds later, the center screen illuminated, revealing a newscast on the latest developments of the avian flu.
[02:10:13.010 --> 02:10:20.519]  Except the news broadcast wasn't real, it was part of a tabletop exercise full of hypothetical situations intended to test ASU's response.
[02:10:20.519 --> 02:10:30.432]  Yeah, it's meant to fool NSA computers so that branches of the government that aren't part of the terror op, when they really launch a bio-attack, they're so used to hearing chatter about it that the government's unable to stop it.
[02:10:31.144 --> 02:10:33.006]  That's how the criminals in government operate.
[02:10:33.006 --> 02:10:34.247]  Very sophisticated.
[02:10:34.247 --> 02:10:44.416]  And then it creates fear-mongering and hype and the perception by the intelligentsia that this is going to be normal when the bird flu comes, normal when the mass deaths happen, all the Hollywood movies saying the same thing.
[02:10:44.416 --> 02:10:48.440]  Then you read globalist documents and they say they're going to release bioweapons and kill you and your family.
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:50.622]  So just know the number one culprits as you're dying are them.
[02:10:50.622 --> 02:10:53.325]  Just remember, at least as you're dying, you'll know I was right.
[02:10:56.574 --> 02:11:03.862]  Might not have a very good internet connection over to the screw-loose chains of the Randy Forums to try to debunk us when the government's releasing their bioweapon on you, whenever that is.
[02:11:03.862 --> 02:11:07.466]  Next month, 20 years from now, I don't know, they just say they're gonna do it.
[02:11:07.466 --> 02:11:12.391]  But you can still feel powerful as, you know, you're getting your chips now, everything's okay.
[02:11:12.391 --> 02:11:14.493]  Oh my goodness.
[02:11:14.493 --> 02:11:18.978]  Speeders under Florida law face vehicle confiscation.
[02:11:20.746 --> 02:11:31.353]  And it says, as of October 1st, anyone caught doing 30 miles over the speed limit in Florida faces vehicle confiscation, 5 to 10 years in prison, and 10-year license suspension.
[02:11:31.353 --> 02:11:39.698]  Bill HB 137, which was signed into law earlier today, was originally targeted at motorcyclists, but was amended at last minute to include all vehicles.
[02:11:39.698 --> 02:11:46.763]  The full text of the bill follows, and you can read it, and some of you are going to say, well man, 30 miles over the speed limit, that's reckless driving.
[02:11:47.575 --> 02:11:57.497]  Oh yeah, I was driving out to Crawford one time to cover an event on a 60 mile an hour road, and guess how fast I was going on my cruise control?
[02:11:57.497 --> 02:12:12.420]  Rob and Aaron were both in the car with me, had their cameras ready, we're driving, and I'm driving in the middle of nowhere out in the country, there's nothing around, and I didn't see, I mean he was waiting, I didn't see the 30 mile an hour.
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:14.100]  It went down to 30 miles an hour.
[02:12:14.838 --> 02:12:23.221]  And that was because down a concrete road, behind a bunch of trees, was a middle school.
[02:12:23.221 --> 02:12:24.722]  Now, wasn't the school light flashing?
[02:12:24.722 --> 02:12:27.983]  It was just, you gotta go 30, and it's only for about 100 yards.
[02:12:27.983 --> 02:12:36.086]  And so I'm, you know, you're talking, you're trying to watch the sign, and you're blah, blah, blah, you're going down a straight road in the country, and they put a speed trap there.
[02:12:36.086 --> 02:12:41.248]  And he comes over and he goes, hey, Alex Jones, listen to your radio show on the internet, listen to you on Coast to Coast.
[02:12:41.248 --> 02:12:41.968]  And, uh...
[02:12:43.709 --> 02:12:45.390]  I go, do you want my license and registration and stuff?
[02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:45.830]  He goes, no.
[02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:47.490]  He goes, I know who you are.
[02:12:47.490 --> 02:12:48.430]  Let me just give you a ticket.
[02:12:48.430 --> 02:12:49.411]  That was really weird.
[02:12:49.411 --> 02:12:51.271]  And he just comes back and gives me a ticket.
[02:12:51.271 --> 02:12:52.312]  And you want to see my insurance?
[02:12:52.312 --> 02:12:53.772]  No, I know you got it.
[02:12:53.772 --> 02:12:56.973]  He says, have a good one.
[02:12:56.973 --> 02:12:58.313]  And I'll never forget that.
[02:12:58.313 --> 02:13:01.534]  But the point is, boom, I'm going to prison 10 years.
[02:13:01.534 --> 02:13:10.197]  I mean, driving will have to be white knuckle, totally focused, just hyperventilating, not to, you know, you got a late library book.
[02:13:10.197 --> 02:13:10.977]  Felony charges.
[02:13:11.973 --> 02:13:14.335]  Uh, you don't return a video two days late.
[02:13:14.335 --> 02:13:16.056]  Felony charges.
[02:13:16.056 --> 02:13:22.561]  Uh, you don't, um, you drop a banana peel or, or, or, or apple core.
[02:13:22.561 --> 02:13:23.382]  You're arrested.
[02:13:23.382 --> 02:13:25.163]  Misdemeanor charges.
[02:13:25.163 --> 02:13:26.324]  You don't make a turn signal.
[02:13:26.324 --> 02:13:27.325]  You're arrested.
[02:13:27.325 --> 02:13:28.425]  You don't have a seatbelt on.
[02:13:28.425 --> 02:13:29.086]  You're arrested.
[02:13:29.887 --> 02:13:32.488]  The cop's waiting in the neighborhood, Lago Vista.
[02:13:32.488 --> 02:13:36.948]  She takes off her seatbelt, gets out at the community mailbox, couple hundred yards from her home.
[02:13:36.948 --> 02:13:37.969]  The cop's admitted in court.
[02:13:37.969 --> 02:13:39.649]  Yeah, she had it on, took it off.
[02:13:39.649 --> 02:13:41.049]  I witnessed her doing it.
[02:13:41.049 --> 02:13:44.030]  I mean, they're sitting around all over England.
[02:13:44.030 --> 02:13:44.850]  They have spies.
[02:13:44.850 --> 02:13:47.670]  If you're making racial comments at dinner, at restaurants, they have you arrested.
[02:13:47.670 --> 02:13:55.892]  You know, all of this thought crime, harassment, total control with the private prison companies lobbying all over the country right now.
[02:13:57.094 --> 02:14:00.355]  To, quote, make stricter laws to put more people in prison.
[02:14:00.355 --> 02:14:05.657]  See, and they always release the violent offenders to go out and terrorize us.
[02:14:05.657 --> 02:14:06.357]  It's a formula.
[02:14:06.357 --> 02:14:09.098]  They always do that to say, well, see, we need more people in prison!
[02:14:09.098 --> 02:14:23.122]  While they disarm us in our cities so they can have their way with us, and while every criminal in Latin America knows they can come to the U.S., give any fake name they want, and get an ID with a new identity, and sometimes have five, six identities, and go back and forth, kill cops, kill FBI, kill whoever they want!
[02:14:24.241 --> 02:14:27.242]  Hundreds of cops, hundreds, hundreds are killed a year.
[02:14:27.242 --> 02:14:31.004]  Go look at the numbers.
[02:14:31.004 --> 02:14:34.766]  Scores every year in Southern California and they just run right back to Mexico, no extradition.
[02:14:35.695 --> 02:14:39.958]  You don't care how many dead cops there are because they don't tell you that's a threat so you're not scared of it.
[02:14:39.958 --> 02:14:44.662]  They tell you citizens are a threat so you shake in fear and shake when you walk up to cars.
[02:14:44.662 --> 02:14:48.144]  When your real death is the semis flying by you two feet away.
[02:14:48.144 --> 02:14:50.726]  I'll see these cops with semis right by them.
[02:14:50.726 --> 02:14:54.829]  Daredevil just walking right by traffic going 70 miles an hour.
[02:14:56.528 --> 02:14:58.468]  Hanging their butts out in the road.
[02:14:58.468 --> 02:15:02.249]  I keep making that point, but they're not scared because they weren't taught to be afraid.
[02:15:02.249 --> 02:15:09.751]  But man, talk about a citizen, they're just... Roadside bombs are everywhere.
[02:15:09.751 --> 02:15:12.072]  Oh my God.
[02:15:12.072 --> 02:15:14.432]  All part of the paranoia.
[02:15:14.432 --> 02:15:16.193]  Go read the bill.
[02:15:16.193 --> 02:15:20.794]  So what happens is, you're going down the road and it goes from 60 to 30.
[02:15:20.794 --> 02:15:23.495]  Boom, they got you.
[02:15:23.495 --> 02:15:25.355]  10 years in prison.
[02:15:30.212 --> 02:15:31.972]  And the state was smart.
[02:15:31.972 --> 02:15:33.873]  They didn't make it a debate about whether he should go to jail.
[02:15:33.873 --> 02:15:40.157]  They made it a debate about, that's a Delphi technique, about whether it should be just for motorcycles or everybody.
[02:15:40.157 --> 02:15:47.941]  They said, should people go to 30 years for going, I mean, 10 years in prison for 30 miles over the speed limit?
[02:15:47.941 --> 02:15:53.724]  Should they, because it says in the newspaper that that was the debate, was about that.
[02:15:53.724 --> 02:15:54.564]  Should you get
[02:15:55.605 --> 02:15:56.646]  30 years.
[02:15:56.646 --> 02:15:57.486]  I keep getting it wrong.
[02:15:57.486 --> 02:16:03.248]  Should you get 10 years for going 30 miles over the speed limit if you're a motorcyclist or if you're a car driver or both.
[02:16:03.248 --> 02:16:04.689]  And so they had a big fight with each other.
[02:16:04.689 --> 02:16:05.889]  It was a false choice.
[02:16:05.889 --> 02:16:07.450]  Should it be motorcycles or everybody?
[02:16:07.450 --> 02:16:08.971]  They said, everybody, everybody.
[02:16:08.971 --> 02:16:09.911]  That's not fair.
[02:16:09.911 --> 02:16:10.831]  All of us.
[02:16:10.831 --> 02:16:12.072]  And they said, okay, don't worry.
[02:16:12.072 --> 02:16:13.832]  All of you now.
[02:16:13.832 --> 02:16:19.435]  Another behavioral psychologist operation works with absolute precision.
[02:16:19.435 --> 02:16:21.275]  30 miles.
[02:16:21.275 --> 02:16:23.176]  That's extreme.
[02:16:23.176 --> 02:16:23.496]  Oh yeah.
[02:16:23.496 --> 02:16:24.897]  I got one for 30 miles over.
[02:16:25.891 --> 02:16:28.552]  Whatever town that was outside Crawford.
[02:16:28.552 --> 02:16:29.112]  30 miles over.
[02:16:29.112 --> 02:16:30.453]  I've only had one of those tickets in my life.
[02:16:30.453 --> 02:16:32.474]  Usually it's like 8 miles over, you know?
[02:16:32.474 --> 02:16:35.555]  Now they give them to you for 5 over.
[02:16:35.555 --> 02:16:42.257]  Speeders under Florida law face vehicle confiscation, 5 to 10 years in prison.
[02:16:42.257 --> 02:16:44.098]  Oh, right.
[02:16:44.098 --> 02:16:44.778]  Isn't that nice?
[02:16:44.778 --> 02:16:45.539]  Isn't that special?
[02:16:45.539 --> 02:16:47.819]  Gun owners protest police action.
[02:16:47.819 --> 02:16:49.220]  I'm gonna play this in a moment.
[02:16:51.671 --> 02:16:55.315]  Globalist take a step closer to $200 a barrel oil.
[02:16:55.315 --> 02:16:56.796]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:16:56.796 --> 02:17:07.347]  Globalist hell-bent on reducing the living standards of Westerners by jacking up oil prices in a whopping $200 a barrel took a step closer to their target yesterday after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
[02:17:07.347 --> 02:17:10.770]  announced that they will begin trading oil by the end of the year.
[02:17:10.770 --> 02:17:12.832]  And JPMorgan went on to say they believe that it will be $200
[02:17:16.749 --> 02:17:25.233]  By the end of this year, I don't know if that's really going to happen, but the fact that they're betting on that, just get ready for a rapin'!
[02:17:25.233 --> 02:17:38.118]  I remember the different debunking forums and digging my own website where they can post, making fun of me six months ago, a year ago, going, these lying nuts are dollar-ridden weak!
[02:17:38.118 --> 02:17:42.900]  I tell you, trying to undermine our country, we don't appreciate you!
[02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:44.681]  Just all that kind of garbage from you.
[02:17:45.393 --> 02:17:51.197]  I mean, these thumb-sucking patriots, they're not real patriots, but they're these little rosy-cheeked, soft guys.
[02:17:51.197 --> 02:18:00.702]  They've always, you know, got a crew cut, and act like they're real tough, and they're really just little, little, uh... I don't know what the right term.
[02:18:00.702 --> 02:18:01.743]  Well, I've got a profane term.
[02:18:01.743 --> 02:18:02.964]  I'm not going to use it.
[02:18:02.964 --> 02:18:11.829]  Just little... groveling, sycophant pumps that just follow after the system, like, you know, little kiss-ups.
[02:18:11.829 --> 02:18:12.790]  Yeah, thumb-suckers.
[02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:13.430]  Bedwetters.
[02:18:13.430 --> 02:18:14.391]  I don't know what you call them.
[02:18:14.972 --> 02:18:20.957]  I've got really worse comments about the color of their noses, but... I just can't!
[02:18:20.957 --> 02:18:22.918]  These people, you sick fools!
[02:18:22.918 --> 02:18:25.360]  You're cowardly little scumbags!
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:27.422]  You can't handle the factors of real tyranny!
[02:18:27.422 --> 02:18:30.604]  You certainly don't have the manhood to stand up and fight this evil!
[02:18:30.604 --> 02:18:33.507]  The risk of your blood and name and treasure!
[02:18:33.507 --> 02:18:37.289]  So instead, you just ninny and lie about everything and deny everything!
[02:18:37.289 --> 02:18:40.292]  Oh, like this, um... AP reported days ago...
[02:18:41.067 --> 02:18:42.128]  I never even got to it.
[02:18:42.128 --> 02:18:43.729]  In fact, I just had it in the stack.
[02:18:43.729 --> 02:18:52.014]  That, oh, the Pentagon quietly admitted the latest find of Iranian weapons was not Iranian at all.
[02:18:52.014 --> 02:18:52.895]  It was Russian.
[02:18:52.895 --> 02:18:54.276]  Bought decades ago.
[02:18:54.276 --> 02:18:55.096]  And they know that.
[02:18:55.096 --> 02:18:56.277]  It's all got serial numbers.
[02:18:56.277 --> 02:18:58.658]  It's all in Jane's weapons encyclopedia.
[02:18:58.658 --> 02:18:59.539]  They all know.
[02:18:59.539 --> 02:19:03.361]  The weapons experts, within seconds, know what it is.
[02:19:03.361 --> 02:19:04.922]  Iran's trying to make peace deals.
[02:19:04.922 --> 02:19:06.423]  Iran's trying to work everything out.
[02:19:07.683 --> 02:19:10.925]  Al-Sadr keeps making peace deals and they keep trying to murder him.
[02:19:10.925 --> 02:19:16.609]  And then when he fights back, you know, they call him Al-Qaeda terrorist, when Shiites are the opposite of Al-Qaeda.
[02:19:16.609 --> 02:19:23.514]  And every few months they go, we found another weapons cache, General Petraeus comes before the media and says, it's definitely Iran, we've got to hit them.
[02:19:23.514 --> 02:19:26.056]  And the media goes, oh my God, that's incredible.
[02:19:26.056 --> 02:19:28.417]  And then later they've got it, and actually it was Russian.
[02:19:29.738 --> 02:19:31.119]  Fifteen years old.
[02:19:31.119 --> 02:19:33.540]  It doesn't matter.
[02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:34.481]  I ran with Al Qaeda.
[02:19:34.481 --> 02:19:36.582]  That's why our Al Qaeda forces are hitting them hard.
[02:19:36.582 --> 02:19:38.463]  Meanwhile, I ran suing the U.S.
[02:19:38.463 --> 02:19:40.984]  for running Al Qaeda.
[02:19:40.984 --> 02:19:42.385]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:48.004 --> 02:19:52.386]  Prepare for an uncertain future with DVDs from the winner of 12 Telly Awards.

[02:20:25.290 --> 02:20:25.670]  I think so.
[02:20:47.421 --> 02:20:48.603]  Dead Enders for Midas, May 15, 2008.

[02:21:02.381 --> 02:21:08.166]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[02:21:08.166 --> 02:21:12.810]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan revolution.
[02:21:12.810 --> 02:21:21.317]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:21:21.317 --> 02:21:23.879]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:21:24.159 --> 02:21:28.240]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:34.962]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[02:21:55.513 --> 02:21:58.556]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:21:58.556 --> 02:22:04.300]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.

[02:24:14.375 --> 02:24:18.217]  They'll probably say, you want help?
[02:24:18.217 --> 02:24:19.677]  What kind of gold you got?
[02:24:19.677 --> 02:24:22.859]  Want a little bit of payment?
[02:24:22.859 --> 02:24:25.200]  But even if they were the best people on earth, they can't help you.
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:25.981]  They're not gonna help you.
[02:24:25.981 --> 02:24:27.862]  They're not gonna help you when it floods.
[02:24:27.862 --> 02:24:29.483]  They're not gonna help you when bad stuff happens.
[02:24:29.483 --> 02:24:29.903]  They can't.
[02:24:30.635 --> 02:24:34.458]  All government can do is suck off any of you and have their way with you, okay?
[02:24:34.458 --> 02:24:41.903]  By and large, government's a cancer, a blight, a horrible thing with a bunch of idiots who couldn't make it in the private sector ruling over you.
[02:24:41.903 --> 02:24:46.786]  Okay, let's go ahead now and take another call.
[02:24:46.786 --> 02:24:48.707]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:24:48.707 --> 02:24:49.788]  Hey, Alex.
[02:24:49.788 --> 02:24:54.131]  I wanted to tell you there's some interesting things going on that I found out here.
[02:24:54.131 --> 02:24:55.652]  My wife's nephew
[02:24:58.926 --> 02:25:27.960]  It attends Moore Valley High School down here, and lately he just told us that for a summer job, his teacher, which is a history teacher, works over at ASU and said that he could earn extra credit points for college and get paid minimum wage to go over to ASU and do a thing that they have a program over there where they inject food, antibiotics into food, and also vaccines and ship them over to third world countries.
[02:25:29.285 --> 02:25:34.129]  And, uh, this is something he can earn extra credit points for, like I said, and make minimum wage.
[02:25:34.129 --> 02:25:35.970]  And I thought this was very odd.
[02:25:35.970 --> 02:25:42.915]  You know, I haven't hit the news or anything, but... No, no, I mean, it's... I'm sure they're doing some type of eugenics situation.
[02:25:42.915 --> 02:25:46.738]  Try to get him to give you whatever documents he can so I can prove who he is.
[02:25:46.738 --> 02:25:49.520]  And I'd like to have him on as a guest, even covertly.
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:54.203]  But, yeah, no, I mean, have you heard me talk about how they're putting bioweapons in the food and shipping it over there?
[02:25:55.365 --> 02:25:57.468]  Yeah, that's exactly what I think it is.
[02:25:57.468 --> 02:25:58.849]  I mean, they're just telling the kids this.
[02:25:58.849 --> 02:26:00.211]  They're telling them it's antibiotics.
[02:26:00.211 --> 02:26:03.455]  We're giving them medicine.
[02:26:03.455 --> 02:26:05.317]  Now are they telling them don't tell anybody?
[02:26:05.317 --> 02:26:08.541]  But sometimes they hide it in plain view and just act like it's no big deal.
[02:26:08.541 --> 02:26:13.007]  So they're putting antibiotics because they need antibiotics in their food?
[02:26:13.903 --> 02:26:14.464]  Exactly.
[02:26:14.464 --> 02:26:19.790]  They're saying that it's for kids over there that can't take shots or have a, you know, they're just telling them.
[02:26:19.790 --> 02:26:23.134]  Well, you know, that's the thing is I read UN reports four or five years ago.
[02:26:23.134 --> 02:26:30.322]  It was like in BBC and some other places that, yeah, said the Africans don't trust us and think the government's giving them AIDS and polio.
[02:26:30.322 --> 02:26:33.426]  So now they're going to put the vaccines directly into the potatoes.
[02:26:34.126 --> 02:26:38.267]  And I guess it's probably some pilot test by the university for Big Pharma.
[02:26:38.267 --> 02:26:44.909]  Man, that's why I wish I had a hundred investigators and the money to have people and the money to do research projects.
[02:26:44.909 --> 02:26:49.590]  They'd probably kill me if I did that though and got that effective, to where I would send in spies.
[02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:52.991]  I mean, I guarantee you I could fly out and infiltrate that college right now.
[02:26:52.991 --> 02:26:55.852]  If I knew the department, the name, I'd walk in there like I was real stupid and
[02:26:56.352 --> 02:26:56.992]  You know, get through.
[02:26:56.992 --> 02:27:01.113]  They usually got security doors, but I'd knock on it and go, Jim didn't give it to me.
[02:27:01.113 --> 02:27:02.193]  Hey, is Bissy in here?
[02:27:02.193 --> 02:27:04.273]  And they'll go, no, he's not, and act annoyed.
[02:27:04.273 --> 02:27:05.494]  I'd go, oh, sorry.
[02:27:05.494 --> 02:27:06.394]  Wander right in.
[02:27:06.394 --> 02:27:10.175]  They'd be in there in their lab, you know, injecting Proganian-9 in.
[02:27:10.175 --> 02:27:11.275]  Love you, black people.
[02:27:11.275 --> 02:27:11.975]  Love you.
[02:27:11.975 --> 02:27:12.855]  Government's good.
[02:27:12.855 --> 02:27:13.675]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:13.675 --> 02:27:17.956]  I could get that on video, but then they'd probably just arrest me for going into the love area.
[02:27:17.956 --> 02:27:23.637]  Tell me the name of the love facility where they love them, and I'll do some research on it.
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:25.760]  Yeah, I'll find out.
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:31.602]  I'm just freaking out there hearing about this, so I just act like it's a big joke, because it drives me crazy.
[02:27:31.602 --> 02:27:34.223]  Well, tell me the name of the school again.
[02:27:34.223 --> 02:27:43.606]  It's Moon Valley High School, where he attends, and it's his history teacher there, that is doing this program over at ASU during the summertime.
[02:27:43.606 --> 02:27:50.489]  And he said they inject medicine because, quote, the kids can't get their shots, i.e.
[02:27:50.489 --> 02:27:51.149]  won't take them.
[02:27:52.834 --> 02:27:53.895]  ASU, you say?
[02:27:53.895 --> 02:27:55.676]  Arizona State?
[02:27:55.676 --> 02:27:57.917]  Yeah, that's where the thing's going to be taken place.
[02:27:57.917 --> 02:27:59.138]  How many campuses do they have?
[02:27:59.138 --> 02:28:00.818]  Is that the biology department?
[02:28:00.818 --> 02:28:02.099]  That's what I need to find out.
[02:28:02.099 --> 02:28:03.920]  We do have a couple campuses down here.
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:05.061]  Here's the deal.
[02:28:05.061 --> 02:28:09.303]  Whenever you get something like this, you are in the enemy camp.
[02:28:09.303 --> 02:28:12.105]  We are sabotaging them in the info war.
[02:28:12.105 --> 02:28:13.686]  Nothing violent.
[02:28:13.686 --> 02:28:17.848]  And you have to realize that you are literally like Obi-Wan Kenobi on the Death Star.
[02:28:17.848 --> 02:28:19.749]  You need to lower their tractor beam shield.
[02:28:20.249 --> 02:28:24.010]  And I mean, when you get this, you gotta act real calm and say, oh, give me more, that's interesting.
[02:28:24.010 --> 02:28:36.172]  And we're not trained to do this, just like, go to his house, demand, you know, oh, paperwork, let me just scan this, I promise I'll black your name out, feed us the data, crush the enemy, just like we exposed their secret preacher program.
[02:28:36.172 --> 02:28:37.872]  We're gonna get these people.
[02:28:37.872 --> 02:28:39.452]  And you know what?
[02:28:39.452 --> 02:28:49.314]  Guaranteed, that's the same program with, quote, vaccines, and then if we had the money to have those potatoes tested, you're gonna find out it's some type of sterilization pathogen.
[02:28:50.356 --> 02:28:50.876]  Exactly.
[02:28:50.876 --> 02:28:52.617]  Oh, I'm so sick of them.
[02:28:52.617 --> 02:28:53.478]  I agree with you, Alex.
[02:28:53.478 --> 02:28:55.799]  I just wanted to give you a heads up on it.
[02:28:55.799 --> 02:28:59.842]  I just found out about this, and I'll get more info and get back to you.
[02:28:59.842 --> 02:29:00.302]  Good job.
[02:29:00.302 --> 02:29:01.402]  Appreciate the call.
[02:29:01.402 --> 02:29:06.405]  And you bet I freak out about this kind of stuff, because I believe that story, and if you follow it, it'll end up being true.
[02:29:06.405 --> 02:29:09.007]  See, the universities, they're factories of evil.
[02:29:09.007 --> 02:29:13.449]  But not just factories of evil, it's factories of training these students that all of this is normal.
[02:29:13.449 --> 02:29:17.832]  By the way, that's why we're having a Money Bomb at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[02:29:18.732 --> 02:29:20.934]  Because, uh, I want to hire more people.
[02:29:20.934 --> 02:29:22.035]  I want to do more research.
[02:29:22.035 --> 02:29:26.558]  I want to get better cameras, better radio equipment, better TV equipment.
[02:29:26.558 --> 02:29:33.484]  And, uh, it wasn't my idea to have a money bomb, but I'm not going to stand by while a money bomb happens that isn't a big success, and I hope you don't either.
[02:29:33.484 --> 02:29:38.388]  And I guarantee 100% of the proceeds will go to fight the New World Order.
[02:29:38.388 --> 02:29:39.789]  We're on the march.
[02:29:39.789 --> 02:29:42.311]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:42.311 --> 02:29:45.013]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:47.912 --> 02:29:53.258]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[02:29:53.258 --> 02:29:59.286]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[02:29:59.286 --> 02:30:06.114]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[02:30:06.434 --> 02:30:15.444]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.
[02:30:15.444 --> 02:30:20.070]  With Password Safe Pro, your passwords can be secured in an encrypted database within minutes.
[02:30:21.451 --> 02:30:22.191]  It is a big idea.
[02:30:50.822 --> 02:30:52.602]  A New World Order.
[02:30:52.602 --> 02:30:57.483]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:30:57.483 --> 02:31:00.324]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:31:00.324 --> 02:31:03.105]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[02:31:03.105 --> 02:31:06.285]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:31:06.285 --> 02:31:13.607]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:31:16.636 --> 02:31:22.080]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:25.962]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:31:25.962 --> 02:31:28.524]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:31:28.524 --> 02:31:29.685]  Most people have no idea.
[02:31:29.685 --> 02:31:30.465]  They're not after money.
[02:31:30.465 --> 02:31:31.746]  They have all the money they need.
[02:31:31.746 --> 02:31:32.727]  They're after power.
[02:31:32.727 --> 02:31:33.888]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:31:42.613 --> 02:31:43.374]  Endgame.
[02:31:43.374 --> 02:31:45.395]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[02:31:45.395 --> 02:31:46.476]  You have been warned.
[02:31:47.697 --> 02:31:51.499]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[02:31:51.499 --> 02:31:55.641]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[02:31:55.641 --> 02:32:02.444]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[02:32:02.444 --> 02:32:05.346]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[02:32:05.726 --> 02:32:15.132]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[02:32:15.132 --> 02:32:19.796]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[02:32:19.796 --> 02:32:22.918]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[02:32:22.918 --> 02:32:29.362]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[02:32:29.362 --> 02:32:35.366]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with Oxysilver.
[02:32:35.746 --> 02:32:37.988]  Order your supply now by calling toll-free 1-877-817-9829.
[02:32:37.988 --> 02:32:38.428]  That's 1-877-817-9829.
[02:32:38.428 --> 02:32:38.768]  Do it now!
[02:32:59.150 --> 02:33:19.579]  There's a stone in yonder graveyard With my name carved in it deep It don't tell my life story These things it can't repeat
[02:33:22.043 --> 02:33:27.209]  I never had a family.
[02:33:27.209 --> 02:33:31.313]  I never took a wife.
[02:33:31.313 --> 02:33:41.223]  All I had was a bottle and I drank away my life.
[02:33:45.627 --> 02:34:10.758]  So bury the bottle with me For it's what tore me down So I won't be alone tonight When they put me in the ground When they lower my body down
[02:34:15.334 --> 02:34:43.156]  A drunkard is a sinner On this I place no doubt Oh, the Lord won't share his palace With the things he lives without For the bottle is the devil And drinkin'
[02:34:44.338 --> 02:34:49.586]  Is his name now the bottle?
[02:34:49.586 --> 02:34:56.155]  Is what took my soul and petrified my brain?
[02:35:04.604 --> 02:35:07.606]  Man, Dick Curliss!
[02:35:07.606 --> 02:35:26.778]  That is real country music right there.
[02:35:26.778 --> 02:35:28.239]  Later we'll play When Daddy Was Around.
[02:35:28.239 --> 02:35:29.320]  That's a really sad song.
[02:35:30.166 --> 02:35:39.970]  I was rude to my dad the other day on the phone, and I was a few nights ago watching, actually last night, watching the Dick Kurlis song on YouTube.
[02:35:39.970 --> 02:35:47.173]  I was watching it, you know, it's the audio with images on it, and I called up my dad and said hi to him, because I heard that when daddy was around, song.
[02:35:47.173 --> 02:35:50.614]  Better treat your parents good, folks, because you never know how long you're going to have them.
[02:35:50.614 --> 02:35:56.557]  Same thing with your wife, your husband, your kids, and don't sweat the little stuff, because at least you're not in Myanmar, Burma.
[02:35:57.307 --> 02:36:05.334]  You know, where there's 30-something thousand dead or 50-something thousand dead in China from a big earthquake.
[02:36:05.334 --> 02:36:11.639]  We're going to go to Dave, Randy, Leo, Kyle, a bunch of other people, but I've got to play this now or we'll never get to it.
[02:36:11.639 --> 02:36:15.843]  I've got a lot of other stuff I'm going to be playing too after we take these calls.
[02:36:15.843 --> 02:36:17.224]  I want to play this first.
[02:36:17.224 --> 02:36:20.007]  911 operator, I don't give a bleep what happens to you.
[02:36:21.417 --> 02:36:33.501]  And then we'll juxtapose that to some cowardly citizens at a city council meeting, literally just crying and whining that citizens can walk around with guns on their hips.
[02:36:33.501 --> 02:36:34.661]  Why not?
[02:36:34.661 --> 02:36:37.442]  You think a bank robber is going to follow law?
[02:36:37.442 --> 02:36:39.163]  We're a safer society.
[02:36:39.163 --> 02:36:41.964]  We need to get over our phobia of guns.
[02:36:41.964 --> 02:36:45.645]  I mean, let me tell you, you try to drive around in Texas with a gun in your pickup rack,
[02:36:46.184 --> 02:36:48.185]  The cops will pull you over.
[02:36:48.185 --> 02:36:49.847]  Hyperventilating.
[02:36:49.847 --> 02:36:51.007]  What you got that for?
[02:36:51.007 --> 02:36:51.888]  I'm the one who has it.
[02:36:51.888 --> 02:36:53.429]  I'm the one.
[02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:58.633]  Hey, Bubba, back when everybody had guns in their pickup trucks, we didn't have very much crime.
[02:36:58.633 --> 02:37:00.294]  Cops were a lot safer.
[02:37:00.294 --> 02:37:01.675]  I know most of the police know that.
[02:37:01.675 --> 02:37:05.778]  I mean, they're not one-tenth as idiotic as the general public.
[02:37:05.778 --> 02:37:09.440]  I've told you, I had a carpet cleaner at my house who saw a shotgun in a rack.
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:11.062]  This was back before I had children.
[02:37:11.062 --> 02:37:12.623]  Up on the wall.
[02:37:12.623 --> 02:37:15.685]  In the radio studio when I was in for my house, I had a, you know, shotgun on the wall.
[02:37:16.673 --> 02:37:20.776]  And he was like looking at it and acting weird and scared in the room.
[02:37:20.776 --> 02:37:22.177]  And I was like, what's going on?
[02:37:22.177 --> 02:37:24.739]  And he was like, well, are you allowed to have that?
[02:37:24.739 --> 02:37:30.044]  And he went and tried to call the police on me, but the higher ups at the carbon cleaner place said no.
[02:37:30.044 --> 02:37:31.425]  And I had a bad feeling and called.
[02:37:31.425 --> 02:37:34.667]  And the manager says, we stopped him from calling.
[02:37:34.667 --> 02:37:37.709]  We understand you're allowed to own it.
[02:37:37.709 --> 02:37:39.751]  But if you don't like it, you don't have to use us anymore.
[02:37:39.751 --> 02:37:43.194]  And then that night on AXS TV, his assistant called in.
[02:37:43.194 --> 02:37:44.675]  I was telling the story and he said, yeah,
[02:37:45.732 --> 02:37:55.494]  Uh, I was there, and he'd never seen my TV show before, he just so happened, the assistant just so happened, was a white guy and Hispanic, because Hispanic was like the helper, carpet cleaner, there was two of them.
[02:37:55.494 --> 02:38:01.916]  He goes, yeah, I know it was a big thing, they did call the cops, but then it got stopped, and, because I had a shotgun in my house in Texas!
[02:38:01.916 --> 02:38:06.817]  We're living under mine control!
[02:38:06.817 --> 02:38:15.179]  I see stories every day where people get raided for fish tanks, because the idiot repairmen think that they're making, that methamphetamines being made in terrariums and fish tanks.
[02:38:15.856 --> 02:38:19.499]  I saw that again last week in the news.
[02:38:19.499 --> 02:38:26.423]  They spy on your power bill to see how much power you're using, and if you're a single person in a home using too much.
[02:38:26.423 --> 02:38:43.615]  Everybody I seem to know, I had a friend, I've told this story, didn't use any drugs, didn't even drink, exercise nuts, him and his girlfriend, now they're married, and she was taking botany at UT, botany's plant growing, and idiot repairman, I think it was carpet cleaner again, was at their apartment,
[02:38:44.517 --> 02:38:50.020]  And, uh, this is years before that, before I lived in a house, I lived in an apartment complex, and it was a big freakout.
[02:38:50.020 --> 02:38:56.603]  Boston SWAT team came out, busted down the door, went in, there were orchids growing in the back, but he saw grow light, he saw plants, and...
[02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:00.481]  I'm going to get 30% of whatever the conviction is.
[02:39:00.481 --> 02:39:01.841]  I'm rich!
[02:39:01.841 --> 02:39:17.344]  Most people don't take carpet cleaning jobs and exterminator jobs, folks, because they take them, a lot of them, not all of them, because they want to steal, they want to pick up on your wife, and I've actually seen it happen, and they also want to report on you and get money.
[02:39:17.344 --> 02:39:21.205]  I've seen reports where there are people that work in airport checkout lines
[02:39:21.857 --> 02:39:39.581]  There was one case where the woman made like 200 and something grand next to her, or 30 grand a year, because she was getting percentages of stuff that was seized, and it finally all stopped when some black guy, a botanist, again, back to plants, he owned a big greenhouse, he flew down from North Carolina to buy yaupons in Houston.
[02:39:39.581 --> 02:39:41.561]  Nice trees, we got those in our yard.
[02:39:41.561 --> 02:39:43.222]  Yaupons grow wild here.
[02:39:43.222 --> 02:39:48.043]  And he went and paid 14,000, he was gonna pay $14,000 cash for them, he'd done that every year for decades.
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:50.041]  And he was flying down.
[02:39:50.041 --> 02:39:52.282]  He was flying from North Carolina to Houston.
[02:39:52.282 --> 02:39:53.082]  There's hundreds of cases.
[02:39:53.082 --> 02:39:54.023]  This is just one I remember.
[02:39:54.023 --> 02:39:56.024]  This was on 60 Minutes.
[02:39:56.024 --> 02:40:02.747]  And he goes up, and he pulls out his money, and he's sitting there paying with it, and she licks her lips.
[02:40:04.507 --> 02:40:07.169]  Black guy money, well he's not supposed to have that.
[02:40:07.169 --> 02:40:10.070]  And it's the state called, they seized it, no drugs, no criminal record.
[02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:12.812]  He had the previous purchase orders, he'd already made the order.
[02:40:12.812 --> 02:40:16.675]  He presented that in court, and the federal court said, hey, your money's gone!
[02:40:16.675 --> 02:40:17.255]  Okay?
[02:40:17.255 --> 02:40:18.656]  Don't carry money around!
[02:40:18.656 --> 02:40:20.017]  We rule!
[02:40:20.017 --> 02:40:22.738]  Shut up, we got automatic weapons!
[02:40:22.738 --> 02:40:24.399]  We got armored vehicles!
[02:40:24.399 --> 02:40:27.301]  Take the mercury!
[02:40:27.301 --> 02:40:31.424]  You're lucky you're not an African where we ship in potatoes with sterilization compounds in it!
[02:40:32.711 --> 02:40:34.553]  The Africans run now from the vaccines.
[02:40:34.553 --> 02:40:36.475]  Now they won't eat any of the food they dump off.
[02:40:36.475 --> 02:40:37.916]  The globalists are real mad.
[02:40:37.916 --> 02:40:41.179]  Suddenly all the numbers of them dying from bioweapons are dropping.
[02:40:41.179 --> 02:40:48.506]  It's all over the foreign press that the Nobel Prize winners are coming out, top scientists analyzing the food that's been injected, the vaccines, all of it.
[02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:54.061]  So now they got spray planes out to help the Africans.
[02:40:54.061 --> 02:40:59.802]  Oh, the government's so... And look, if you're not flipping out right now like I am, this is sick.
[02:40:59.802 --> 02:41:00.842]  I hate talking about this.
[02:41:00.842 --> 02:41:02.163]  I hate these people.
[02:41:02.163 --> 02:41:03.283]  That's why I'm getting upset.
[02:41:03.283 --> 02:41:04.923]  And I'll tell you who I really hate.
[02:41:04.923 --> 02:41:09.264]  Well-meaning people in government who have been in denial about this.
[02:41:09.264 --> 02:41:11.585]  Everything we've told you has been happening.
[02:41:11.585 --> 02:41:13.905]  Oil prices, dollar plunging, housing.
[02:41:13.905 --> 02:41:15.346]  We told you years before.
[02:41:15.346 --> 02:41:17.186]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:41:20.067 --> 02:41:20.808]  I'm out of control.
[02:41:20.808 --> 02:41:23.750]  Go ahead and play the lady calling 9-1-1.
[02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:27.713]  I'm so sick of seeing women get raped and killed, and then people say, well, women can't shoot guns.
[02:41:27.713 --> 02:41:29.975]  Women are incredible with guns!
[02:41:29.975 --> 02:41:43.585]  We need to take our women out, you need to take your daughters out, teach them how to shoot, teach them safety, and some piece of garbage comes into her house, you tell her, just be very calm, hit a knee, and pump every round right into the center of their mass.
[02:41:49.170 --> 02:41:56.072]  Watching us be turned into domesticated cattle makes me sick, so a gaggle of steroid heads can rule over us.
[02:41:56.072 --> 02:41:57.492]  Go ahead and play it.
[02:41:57.492 --> 02:41:58.672]  It's like I'm reliving this stuff.
[02:41:58.672 --> 02:41:59.592]  It's really weird.
[02:41:59.592 --> 02:42:01.913]  It's not very good to me.
[02:42:01.913 --> 02:42:08.454]  For the first time, a frightened woman hears what a 911 operator says on the other end of her call for help.
[02:42:08.454 --> 02:42:12.295]  When you call 911, you hope you're talking to someone who cares about what happens to you.
[02:42:12.677 --> 02:42:18.021]  But an exclusive News Channel 5 investigation has uncovered a shocking 9-1-1 emergency.
[02:42:18.021 --> 02:42:23.264]  And what makes it especially shocking is what one call taker says about the woman he's supposed to be helping.
[02:42:23.264 --> 02:42:26.147]  Tonight, Phil Williams has dug up another exclusive investigation.
[02:42:26.147 --> 02:42:32.971]  You know, 9-1-1 workers all across the area do heroic jobs every day under some incredible circumstances.
[02:42:32.971 --> 02:42:39.416]  But as you're about to hear, when a Nashville woman needed help the most back in February, the system completely failed.
[02:42:40.834 --> 02:42:43.957]  And so I'm like looking out the window for him and I don't see him.
[02:42:43.957 --> 02:42:48.440]  For Sheila Jones, this is how her call for help began.
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:48.861]  Boom!
[02:42:48.861 --> 02:42:56.007]  He hits the door and he's coming through fast and I'm like this no no no stop what are you doing you didn't call.
[02:42:56.007 --> 02:42:59.750]  It was an angry ex-boyfriend who had barged into her house.
[02:42:59.750 --> 02:43:00.991]  Literally right here is when
[02:43:01.631 --> 02:43:02.072]  Bam!
[02:43:02.072 --> 02:43:03.072]  He got me!
[02:43:03.072 --> 02:43:05.374]  Metro Nashville, police, fire, medical.
[02:43:05.374 --> 02:43:10.599]  At Metro Nashville's 9-1-1 center, her first call is recorded at 2-0-8 p.m.
[02:43:10.599 --> 02:43:18.105]  I felt danger, I felt threatened, I felt fear, and I felt, I felt, it was like I was seeing myself being dead today, that day.
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:30.922]  And you wanted help.
[02:43:30.922 --> 02:43:33.404]  And I wanted help.
[02:43:33.404 --> 02:43:40.471]  For Sheila, hearing that call obtained by News Channel 5 Investigates resurrects the painful emotions of that day.
[02:43:40.471 --> 02:43:46.737]  You're emotional, you're desperate, you call for help.
[02:43:53.414 --> 02:43:54.775]  Then what happened?
[02:43:54.775 --> 02:43:55.655]  Nothing.
[02:43:55.655 --> 02:43:58.176]  He told me, look, watch out for him.
[02:43:58.176 --> 02:44:00.297]  I ain't gonna see him when he comes.
[02:44:00.297 --> 02:44:01.657]  In fact, get this.
[02:44:01.657 --> 02:44:07.920]  Sheila's 9-1-1 ordealed DragZone for almost three hours through call after call.
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:11.301]  Statements keep on saying they in route, they in route, but they ain't came.
[02:44:11.301 --> 02:44:12.402]  It's been a long time.
[02:44:13.401 --> 02:44:15.723]  And he keeps calling me, threatening me.
[02:44:15.723 --> 02:44:21.146]  Alright, I see where you've called and I'm going to update him and let him know what all you've told me, okay?
[02:44:21.146 --> 02:44:22.107]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:44:22.107 --> 02:44:33.254]  I got one call that said they were en route to you and a more important call came up so they diverted to that call.
[02:44:33.254 --> 02:44:35.556]  I'm saying a knife, my life.
[02:44:37.672 --> 02:44:38.973]  I'm wondering what kind of call they got.
[02:44:38.973 --> 02:44:40.933]  Was somebody actually dead then or something?
[02:44:40.933 --> 02:44:42.754]  So where was the officer?
[02:44:42.754 --> 02:44:49.096]  Well, our investigation discovered he was out helping another officer on a traffic stop.
[02:44:49.096 --> 02:44:52.177]  A traffic stop.
[02:44:52.177 --> 02:44:53.238]  Never showed up.
[02:44:53.238 --> 02:44:57.319]  All while Sheila was praying for somebody, anybody, to help her.
[02:44:57.319 --> 02:44:59.680]  That is so ugly.
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:00.320]  Hit pause.
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:03.762]  It's like that Dick Curnow show.
[02:45:04.887 --> 02:45:06.228]  Go ahead and pause.
[02:45:06.228 --> 02:45:08.890]  It's like that Dick Carlos song we played earlier today.
[02:45:08.890 --> 02:45:11.653]  Woman gets mugged in the heart of town.
[02:45:11.653 --> 02:45:14.215]  Calls for the cops, but there's none around.
[02:45:14.215 --> 02:45:17.958]  They're out on the interstate setting the trap.
[02:45:17.958 --> 02:45:19.579]  Go ahead and go back to it.
[02:45:19.579 --> 02:45:22.041]  It feels like it just happened.
[02:45:22.041 --> 02:45:25.564]  That's how I feel right now, like it just happened just now.
[02:45:25.564 --> 02:45:28.246]  Had to know that they were driving stuff over there.
[02:45:28.246 --> 02:45:29.787]  Is this Sheila Jones?
[02:45:29.787 --> 02:45:30.628]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:30.628 --> 02:45:34.271]  Then, almost two and a half hours in, Sheila calls again.
[02:45:35.003 --> 02:45:38.584]  This time she's told there's no one assigned to answer her call.
[02:45:38.584 --> 02:45:39.804]  Nobody's coming out here?
[02:45:39.804 --> 02:45:40.244]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:45:40.244 --> 02:45:44.085]  As soon as we can start to get an officer available, we're going to send somebody out there.
[02:45:44.085 --> 02:45:49.647]  What do y'all want me to kill me so you can put yellow paper around it and say, we got there just for the day?
[02:45:49.647 --> 02:45:50.447]  Is that it?
[02:45:50.447 --> 02:45:51.527]  I don't want to say it.
[02:45:51.527 --> 02:45:54.668]  It felt like I was a test person.
[02:45:54.668 --> 02:45:56.249]  You know, the test subject.
[02:45:56.249 --> 02:46:00.770]  We're going to see how long it takes for him to go back and actually kill her.
[02:46:00.770 --> 02:46:01.510]  That's what I felt like.
[02:46:01.989 --> 02:46:04.631]  And Sheila had not heard what we had heard.
[02:46:04.631 --> 02:46:06.452]  I don't understand it!
[02:46:06.452 --> 02:46:10.155]  What the 911 call taker says after she hangs up.
[02:46:10.155 --> 02:46:12.837]  I'm scared to even leave my f***ing house!
[02:46:12.837 --> 02:46:17.481]  Okay ma'am, I'll update you as soon as possible.
[02:46:17.481 --> 02:46:22.584]  I really just don't give a s*** what happens here.
[02:46:22.584 --> 02:46:27.808]  What kind of people do they got answering these phones?
[02:46:27.808 --> 02:46:28.149]  Alright!
[02:46:29.352 --> 02:46:30.673]  That's enough.
[02:46:30.673 --> 02:46:42.402]  There are hundreds of cases, you can just Google it, where the woman calls and says he's busting down the door, he has a gun, he has a knife, and they just hang up on you, or say, I don't believe it, or don't come.
[02:46:42.402 --> 02:46:45.645]  But look, what type of chicken-neck society is this?
[02:46:45.645 --> 02:46:54.191]  What type of domesticated, cowardly, pathetic, home of the free, land of the brave, where they trained us decades ago, you dial this number, now they have the tattle, 311,
[02:46:56.323 --> 02:47:01.625]  That's the Tatl number, the Stasi number, the East German Tatl-Tel number, the Snitch number.
[02:47:01.625 --> 02:47:09.627]  But the 911, do-do-do-do, oh help me, they're gonna help me, emergency!
[02:47:09.627 --> 02:47:12.288]  And they don't come.
[02:47:12.288 --> 02:47:14.149]  They don't come.
[02:47:14.149 --> 02:47:19.311]  And it's great, I mean, the fire department comes, the police come, they try, I'm not saying you're even bad.
[02:47:19.311 --> 02:47:20.711]  The point is, 11 minutes.
[02:47:20.711 --> 02:47:23.812]  In fact, did we look that number up?
[02:47:23.812 --> 02:47:24.473]  Average 911 call time?
[02:47:26.983 --> 02:47:27.863]  I forgot to do that earlier.
[02:47:27.863 --> 02:47:28.364]  Did you do that?
[02:47:28.364 --> 02:47:31.145]  8 to 11 minutes.
[02:47:31.145 --> 02:47:32.266]  Okay, so my memory was right.
[02:47:32.266 --> 02:47:34.627]  I remember the national average was like 8 and a half minutes.
[02:47:34.627 --> 02:47:36.227]  So 8 to 11 minutes.
[02:47:36.227 --> 02:47:37.588]  And I guarantee you those are Cook numbers.
[02:47:37.588 --> 02:47:39.909]  It's worse.
[02:47:39.909 --> 02:47:49.254]  The Jones House... I mean, somebody bust down my door, and they got a knife, guaranteed you're dead.
[02:47:49.254 --> 02:47:53.656]  And if I can't get to my gun, I'm gonna attack you savagely.
[02:47:53.656 --> 02:47:56.237]  I mean, you're gonna think you got a rhinoceros attacking you.
[02:47:57.239 --> 02:47:58.420]  Because it's an instinct.
[02:47:58.420 --> 02:48:02.301]  I'm gonna attack somebody who comes in my nest, comes down my hole.
[02:48:02.301 --> 02:48:04.002]  I mean, any mammal does that.
[02:48:04.002 --> 02:48:09.165]  You people don't have your instincts in line.
[02:48:09.165 --> 02:48:10.305]  Oh, man.
[02:48:10.305 --> 02:48:11.746]  Now, let's go to this other clip.
[02:48:11.746 --> 02:48:15.087]  This is the local news.
[02:48:15.087 --> 02:48:19.129]  This is a case where gun owners protest police action.
[02:48:19.129 --> 02:48:26.313]  The Times Tribune, and this is out of Dixon City, a Friday evening police incident, spilled over into a
[02:48:27.549 --> 02:48:35.014]  Borough Council, this is Pennsylvania, yeah, Tuesday when gun rights advocates allegedly harassed by two police officers.
[02:48:35.014 --> 02:48:45.261]  The regular monthly meeting erupted into a full-blown debate on the Second Amendment with more than 20 Pennsylvania Firearm Owners Association members, many of whom were openly armed, argued that their right to carry a weapon in public.
[02:48:45.261 --> 02:48:48.963]  Yeah, English common law, you gotta wear the weapon in the open, it's the concealed.
[02:48:48.963 --> 02:48:52.926]  They trick you and say, oh, we got a permit for a concealed.
[02:48:54.594 --> 02:48:55.515]  And the cops don't know this.
[02:48:55.515 --> 02:48:58.558]  I'm not saying you're tricking anybody, but the lawyers are clear on this.
[02:48:58.558 --> 02:49:04.024]  Under Anglo-Saxon, under mosaic law, it's the same in both laws.
[02:49:04.024 --> 02:49:05.185]  It's ancient law.
[02:49:05.185 --> 02:49:07.707]  You can have a weapon, it just has got to be out in the open.
[02:49:07.707 --> 02:49:11.652]  It was only assassins and thieves and people hide a weapon traditionally.
[02:49:11.652 --> 02:49:14.414]  So the point is, I got a weapon, and that's meant to deter crime, too.
[02:49:14.414 --> 02:49:17.878]  That's why you're also supposed to show the sword, the dagger, the musket, the whatever.
[02:49:19.332 --> 02:49:20.993]  Openly bearing arms.
[02:49:20.993 --> 02:49:22.314]  Keep and bear arms.
[02:49:22.314 --> 02:49:26.297]  You have a right to keep and bear them.
[02:49:26.297 --> 02:49:30.861]  Under law, you're not allowed to conceal.
[02:49:30.861 --> 02:49:34.323]  This is our common law, ladies and gentlemen, in case you didn't know.
[02:49:34.323 --> 02:49:35.544]  It's the concealing.
[02:49:35.544 --> 02:49:40.568]  So, the government only had the true purview under common law to restrict concealed.
[02:49:41.596 --> 02:49:45.258]  So they, they tell you, oh come get a permit for a concealed.
[02:49:45.258 --> 02:49:49.400]  A permit is a right to do something that would be illegal otherwise.
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:53.582]  It is, you know, it's illegal to hunt in the King's Forest.
[02:49:53.582 --> 02:49:57.043]  You get a license, a signet, a letter of mark from him.
[02:49:57.043 --> 02:49:58.224]  That's what a license is.
[02:49:58.224 --> 02:50:01.706]  So see how they, these lawyers know what they're doing.
[02:50:01.706 --> 02:50:05.628]  They trick you into going and then doing something that is illegal.
[02:50:05.628 --> 02:50:07.108]  Well these guys all know.
[02:50:07.108 --> 02:50:08.529]  So they're wearing guns openly.
[02:50:09.205 --> 02:50:19.636]  And they do this, this is an attempt to take the Second Amendment back, instead of having carpet cleaners call the police on you because you got a gun case, because they watch TV shows all featured based in New York where guns are banned.
[02:50:19.636 --> 02:50:24.561]  How many cop shows where they pull you over and go, he's got a gun, oh no permit for this, that's ten years buddy.
[02:50:24.561 --> 02:50:32.189]  See little TV heads that mommy didn't teach them how to brush their teeth, they barely know how to tie their shoelaces as adults, you know who I'm talking about, the general public.
[02:50:32.896 --> 02:50:38.121]  You know, all they do is watch NYPD Blue and then so they're in your house and they think it's illegal.
[02:50:38.121 --> 02:50:43.265]  We gotta start wearing them openly because that makes the idiots realize it's our right.
[02:50:43.265 --> 02:50:44.146]  But we'll tell you what happened.
[02:50:44.146 --> 02:50:48.530]  Play the audio when we get back.
[02:50:48.530 --> 02:50:49.931]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:49.931 --> 02:50:52.774]  A new world order.
[02:50:52.774 --> 02:50:53.715]  In the near future.
[02:50:54.580 --> 02:50:57.643]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[02:50:57.643 --> 02:51:00.486]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:00.486 --> 02:51:03.269]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:51:03.269 --> 02:51:06.453]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:06.453 --> 02:51:13.781]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:16.806 --> 02:51:22.250]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:22.250 --> 02:51:25.632]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:47.407 --> 02:51:53.252]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[02:51:53.252 --> 02:51:58.677]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:51:58.677 --> 02:52:04.042]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:52:04.042 --> 02:52:09.587]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:52:09.887 --> 02:52:10.287]  We're good to go!
[02:52:34.878 --> 02:52:37.662]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.
[02:52:37.662 --> 02:52:44.131]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[02:52:44.131 --> 02:52:45.533]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[02:52:47.230 --> 02:52:51.011]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[02:52:51.011 --> 02:52:55.713]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[02:52:55.713 --> 02:53:01.015]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[02:53:01.015 --> 02:53:12.239]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[02:53:12.239 --> 02:53:14.600]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[02:53:15.020 --> 02:53:17.042]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[02:53:17.042 --> 02:53:17.962]  Let's face it.
[02:53:17.962 --> 02:53:20.805]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[02:53:20.805 --> 02:53:28.811]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[02:53:28.811 --> 02:53:31.113]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:53:31.113 --> 02:53:34.736]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:53:34.736 --> 02:53:38.319]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[02:53:38.319 --> 02:53:40.481]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[02:53:40.481 --> 02:53:42.843]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:53:43.303 --> 02:53:44.944]  And it's safe for all cars.
[02:53:44.944 --> 02:53:51.208]  Act now.
[02:53:51.208 --> 02:53:55.711]  Look, I didn't come up with the idea to do this Money Bomb, and I appreciate the folks that are doing it.
[02:53:55.711 --> 02:53:58.392]  I don't ask for donations on air.
[02:53:58.392 --> 02:54:00.814]  Listeners know that.
[02:54:00.814 --> 02:54:01.674]  I get some.
[02:54:01.674 --> 02:54:06.297]  They've really helped us do a better job around here.
[02:54:06.297 --> 02:54:12.721]  I ask you to donate by buying our books, our videos, the stuff at InfoWars.com, getting a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:54:14.284 --> 02:54:20.150]  But folks, we did set up a Money Bomb for May 31st at Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:54:20.150 --> 02:54:23.393]  We're going to put a PayPal link up on that site soon.
[02:54:23.393 --> 02:54:31.340]  I want to get whoever runs it, and I think we're figuring that out exactly who, on the show in the next few days.
[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:34.463]  I've got the voluntary human extinction people on the Sunday show.
[02:54:34.463 --> 02:54:35.184]  You don't want to miss that.
[02:54:35.184 --> 02:54:36.225]  I think we should all die.
[02:54:36.225 --> 02:54:39.348]  So we'll have one of those people on for you on the Sunday show.
[02:54:41.089 --> 02:54:44.011]  But I do hope that everybody goes and pledges.
[02:54:44.011 --> 02:54:46.233]  I didn't come up with this $100 pledge.
[02:54:46.233 --> 02:54:47.394]  I'm not bashing it.
[02:54:47.394 --> 02:54:52.138]  I'm just saying maybe we should just say you can pledge $1, you can pledge $10.
[02:54:52.138 --> 02:54:53.159]  I mean, most people don't have $100.
[02:54:53.159 --> 02:54:57.363]  And again, somebody does a money bomb.
[02:54:57.363 --> 02:54:59.144]  Ron Paul didn't ask for one.
[02:54:59.144 --> 02:55:00.505]  They just did it.
[02:55:00.505 --> 02:55:03.728]  And a lot of people are frothing with jealousy, thinking I'm going to get a million dollars.
[02:55:03.728 --> 02:55:04.729]  Believe me, we're not, folks.
[02:55:05.305 --> 02:55:08.846]  You know, the kind of the Ron Paul super burn is over.
[02:55:08.846 --> 02:55:09.686]  But, you know, we raised $20,000.
[02:55:09.686 --> 02:55:11.047]  It'd be great.
[02:55:11.047 --> 02:55:13.848]  I'd buy a couple new computers, some cameras.
[02:55:13.848 --> 02:55:15.248]  That'd free up some money I've got.
[02:55:15.248 --> 02:55:17.129]  I'm already going to get a bigger office.
[02:55:17.129 --> 02:55:24.131]  I'm already moving to look into TV production in the next few months, you know, to develop something to put on Dish TV and stuff.
[02:55:24.131 --> 02:55:25.471]  People think it's going to be Valhalla.
[02:55:25.471 --> 02:55:28.232]  It's not, but it's certainly going to help.
[02:55:28.232 --> 02:55:30.093]  And we're always expanding, always growing here.
[02:55:31.056 --> 02:55:36.219]  And, uh, so we try to use, you know, the sponsors, the products we sell to fund our operation.
[02:55:36.219 --> 02:55:37.520]  And I've got 14 employees.
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:39.081]  It's not cheap.
[02:55:39.081 --> 02:55:42.422]  Uh, but, uh, I don't beat the dead horse of gimme money, gimme money, gimme money.
[02:55:42.422 --> 02:55:45.704]  In fact, I've done the whole show today and hadn't plugged my videos live on air.
[02:55:45.704 --> 02:55:52.848]  I really should, because they're a great solution to wake people up to, not just our funding mechanism.
[02:55:52.848 --> 02:55:58.211]  But, uh, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, uh, so many people pledged, uh, it broke the counter.
[02:55:58.211 --> 02:55:59.792]  The counter only went to a hundred.
[02:56:00.526 --> 02:56:02.668]  And so they need to work on that.
[02:56:02.668 --> 02:56:10.874]  But it's a great-looking site, and I just hope you'll go pledge, and I hope you'll do it May 31st, or our enemies will celebrate and go, oh, look.
[02:56:10.874 --> 02:56:15.918]  Ron Paul, I know the show raised a million dollars of the millions he raised, of the 15 million he raised.
[02:56:15.918 --> 02:56:24.165]  I know that we've raised, you know, Celica still at like 15 grand, and we are changed like 10 grand, and we do that.
[02:56:24.165 --> 02:56:26.707]  We're also a platform to support other people.
[02:56:26.707 --> 02:56:28.168]  You are the part of that platform.
[02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:32.122]  So, I don't know what to say.
[02:56:32.122 --> 02:56:37.124]  I mean, I'm not going to let a money bomb go and then have it fizzle, and that would look bad for all of us.
[02:56:37.124 --> 02:56:43.747]  But I didn't think up this money bomb, and so I'm kind of a reluctant volunteer here.
[02:56:43.747 --> 02:56:50.791]  But yes, I give you my word that 100% of the money from this money bomb, and not 100% of the money I make off selling videos.
[02:56:50.791 --> 02:56:53.692]  My wife's got to have a car to drive and food and clothes for my kids.
[02:56:53.692 --> 02:56:54.993]  And I give the videos out for free.
[02:56:54.993 --> 02:56:56.614]  I mean, there's nothing good enough for some people.
[02:56:57.798 --> 02:56:59.239]  Um, the money bomb.
[02:56:59.239 --> 02:57:07.725]  100% of the money will go into this office, into equipment, into upgrades, into things we need.
[02:57:07.725 --> 02:57:12.789]  And, uh, we're under a lot of growing pains right now, and I'm only trying to intensify what we're doing.
[02:57:12.789 --> 02:57:15.651]  And I've told listeners, if you just want to mail me a check and a donation,
[02:57:16.286 --> 02:57:19.367]  Because I just see every other weirdo and crazy getting donations.
[02:57:19.367 --> 02:57:21.628]  I might as well, because I know I'm going to fight the New World Order.
[02:57:21.628 --> 02:57:25.470]  I mean, if you're hell-bent on sending donations, write it out to Alex Jones.
[02:57:25.470 --> 02:57:29.532]  And if you say, I want 100% of this to go to the fight, it'll go to that.
[02:57:29.532 --> 02:57:32.493]  I've got a few donations where it says, spend this on yourself.
[02:57:32.493 --> 02:57:33.434]  And I've actually done it.
[02:57:33.434 --> 02:57:36.675]  OK, honey, let's go to a condo for the weekend with the kids.
[02:57:36.675 --> 02:57:40.197]  I mean, I'm not into material things.
[02:57:40.197 --> 02:57:45.079]  So it's kind of a catch-22, because then I don't money-grub enough to then have the funds I need.
[02:57:46.138 --> 02:57:49.460]  I mean, I literally forget to plug sponsors, forget to plug my videos.
[02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:51.722]  I mean, I've done three hours and haven't done any of it.
[02:57:51.722 --> 02:57:56.545]  You know, you hear some of the ads playing, but what really gets responses is the live-on-air stuff.
[02:57:56.545 --> 02:58:04.631]  So, in closing, for this hour, fourth hour coming up, and I promise I'll get your calls after I play this clip of the gun situation.
[02:58:04.631 --> 02:58:08.673]  I just hope that you will visit InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:08.673 --> 02:58:10.835]  I hope you'll get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:16.821]  For 15 cents a day, I hope you'll burn my films and TV shows and special reports to disk.
[02:58:16.821 --> 02:58:18.282]  They're very, very effective.
[02:58:18.282 --> 02:58:18.902]  Wake people up.
[02:58:18.902 --> 02:58:20.623]  Okay, I know you've been holding a long time.
[02:58:20.623 --> 02:58:29.905]  We're going to come back in this short segment, play the anti-gun ninnying, then go to your calls.
[02:58:29.905 --> 02:58:32.526]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:48.434 --> 02:58:50.175]  America, freedom to fascism.
[02:58:50.175 --> 02:58:57.200]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[02:59:40.816 --> 02:59:43.197]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.197 --> 02:59:45.979]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.130 --> 03:00:26.721]  Every day in the new fourth hour, we've been doing for over a month now, we go live with the document cam, the cam on myself, the guest cam, we have guests, video feeds, audio feeds from the computer, video exclusives for prisonplanet.tv members.
[03:00:26.721 --> 03:00:33.585]  Of course, everybody can listen out there on the AM and FM dial, shortwave, global satellite, and the internet at infowars.com.
[03:00:33.585 --> 03:00:37.308]  So earlier in the last hour, we played that poor woman crying, screaming, begging,
[03:00:38.975 --> 03:00:48.463]  Uh, as this guy's in her house threatening her with a knife, uh, for hours, and, uh, and then you hear the 911 caller say, I don't care what happens to you, lady.
[03:00:48.463 --> 03:00:57.171]  Okay, so you've got that reality there, the average response times, 8 to 11 minutes, depending on what part of the country, uh, and with 911.
[03:00:57.171 --> 03:01:01.375]  Or that areas where they have gun bans for the citizens, crimes exponentially higher.
[03:01:01.375 --> 03:01:06.299]  Or that England's banned all guns, and now it's just guns everywhere, and bedlam, and murder, and that's in the news today.
[03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:26.333]  This is a newscast out of Pennsylvania, where you have these gun rights groups that go around with guns holstered, and the police come and grab them, arrest them, take their guns, and then they go to city council, and they've got their guns, and where they're still under common law, and the cowardly public is just flipping out in fear.
[03:01:26.333 --> 03:01:30.336]  But they trust the corrupt government and the police with guns.
[03:01:30.336 --> 03:01:32.598]  Now again, I think police should have guns.
[03:01:32.598 --> 03:01:33.639]  I just don't try to take mine.
[03:01:34.173 --> 03:01:38.677]  Pointing statistically, you have more criminals in law enforcement than you do in the general public.
[03:01:38.677 --> 03:01:40.058]  And that's Criminology 101.
[03:01:40.058 --> 03:01:41.959]  I'm sorry that I've read the textbooks.
[03:01:41.959 --> 03:01:43.561]  So let's go ahead and roll this.
[03:01:43.561 --> 03:01:50.206]  You want to live your life as a free man and be able to say the things that are guaranteed to you under the First Amendment?
[03:01:50.206 --> 03:01:50.767]  You know what?
[03:01:50.767 --> 03:01:51.707]  Stop it.
[03:01:51.707 --> 03:01:52.068]  You know what?
[03:01:52.068 --> 03:01:54.590]  Why don't I just go to InfoWars.com
[03:01:57.166 --> 03:02:01.989]  And why don't I just play the video so all the viewers can actually watch it?
[03:02:01.989 --> 03:02:10.275]  I keep forgetting that for PrisonPlanet.tv members that this show is interactive.
[03:02:10.275 --> 03:02:12.196]  I just keep forgetting that.
[03:02:12.196 --> 03:02:23.784]  Oh no, there's so many stories here that I may not be able to find that Nemo posts so many stories that he posts like 50 times a day, which is great.
[03:02:23.784 --> 03:02:26.066]  But it scrolls through so fast.
[03:02:26.783 --> 03:02:34.005]  That in the top stories, it's already, who knows where, in Timbuktu or something.
[03:02:34.005 --> 03:02:37.985]  Speeders force face 10 years in prison.
[03:02:37.985 --> 03:02:39.546]  Gun owners protest police action.
[03:02:39.546 --> 03:02:39.926]  There it is.
[03:02:39.926 --> 03:02:42.046]  Okay.
[03:02:42.046 --> 03:02:42.706]  Sorry, folks.
[03:02:42.706 --> 03:02:44.647]  I'm really sorry.
[03:02:44.647 --> 03:02:47.027]  Oh, I just had it.
[03:02:47.027 --> 03:02:47.507]  There we go.
[03:02:47.507 --> 03:02:50.508]  Let's go ahead and click on that.
[03:02:50.508 --> 03:02:54.669]  And we'll go ahead and play this just off my computer here for everybody.
[03:02:55.507 --> 03:02:58.969]  Sorry, I'm getting all my wonderful internet connection here.
[03:02:58.969 --> 03:03:00.970]  It's not loading.
[03:03:00.970 --> 03:03:07.193]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:03:07.193 --> 03:03:17.297]  If you want to live your life as a free man and be able to say the things that are guaranteed to you under the First Amendment, then you need to be able to exercise your Second Amendment.
[03:03:17.297 --> 03:03:20.679]  It ain't about hunting, and it's not even really about self-defense.
[03:03:20.679 --> 03:03:22.920]  It's about protecting us from overbearing government.
[03:03:23.718 --> 03:03:23.998]  Great.
[03:03:23.998 --> 03:03:27.921]  And what was seen up here on Friday night was overbearing government.
[03:03:27.921 --> 03:03:34.406]  When they can come in and do whatever they want, regardless of what the law says, that is overbearing government.
[03:03:34.406 --> 03:03:37.489]  I would like to have input from Dixon City residents first.
[03:03:37.489 --> 03:03:39.170]  I'd like to give them that courtesy.
[03:03:39.170 --> 03:03:42.512]  And then after that, I, uh, Sally, do you have a signing sheet?
[03:03:42.512 --> 03:03:48.577]  I have a signing sheet for all of the members of the organization that would like to speak.
[03:03:49.117 --> 03:03:51.138]  I will ask each of you by name.
[03:03:51.138 --> 03:03:54.038]  I will ask you to come up to the podium.
[03:03:54.038 --> 03:03:56.039]  And this will be a comment session only.
[03:03:56.039 --> 03:03:58.239]  It will not be a question and answer session.
[03:03:58.239 --> 03:04:02.140]  And you will each be given two minutes to make your comments to council.
[03:04:02.140 --> 03:04:05.261]  And you can gladly listen to anything you have to say.
[03:04:05.261 --> 03:04:09.522]  So right now, on this side of the audience, is there anything from any Kingston City residents?
[03:04:09.522 --> 03:04:15.864]  Well, I feel a little intimidated coming to a council meeting and seeing people with guns on their chests.
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:23.581]  We're gonna come back and go to this guy going, we need to have scanners like airports everywhere!
[03:04:23.581 --> 03:04:26.102]  We can't have citizens with guns!
[03:04:26.102 --> 03:04:27.042]  I'm scared!
[03:04:27.042 --> 03:04:27.282]  Oh no!
[03:04:45.871 --> 03:04:47.312]  It is a big idea.
[03:04:47.312 --> 03:04:50.113]  A New World Order.
[03:04:50.113 --> 03:04:54.615]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:04:54.615 --> 03:04:57.857]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:04:57.857 --> 03:05:00.618]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:05:00.618 --> 03:05:03.820]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:05:03.820 --> 03:05:11.124]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:05:14.156 --> 03:05:19.598]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:05:19.598 --> 03:05:23.479]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:05:23.479 --> 03:05:26.040]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:05:26.040 --> 03:05:27.201]  Most people have no idea.
[03:05:27.201 --> 03:05:27.981]  They're not after money.
[03:05:27.981 --> 03:05:29.242]  They have all the money they need.
[03:05:29.242 --> 03:05:30.242]  They're after power.
[03:05:30.242 --> 03:05:31.402]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:06:47.864 --> 03:06:50.245]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[03:06:50.245 --> 03:06:53.747]  Martial Law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[03:06:53.747 --> 03:06:55.707]  It's going to be incremental.
[03:06:55.707 --> 03:06:57.688]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[03:06:57.688 --> 03:07:00.790]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:02.270]  Anything could be the final push.

[03:07:22.944 --> 03:07:26.827]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years, preparing for this takeover.

[03:07:51.155 --> 03:07:52.916]  Mainstream media.
[03:07:52.916 --> 03:07:54.676]  Government cover-ups.
[03:07:54.676 --> 03:07:56.256]  You want answers?

[03:08:01.997 --> 03:08:08.878]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:08.878 --> 03:08:11.359]  Going toe-to-toe with the New World Order.
[03:08:14.699 --> 03:08:15.659]  Yep, that's us.
[03:08:15.659 --> 03:08:16.440]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:08:16.440 --> 03:08:19.041]  I am out of control today, not taking your calls.
[03:08:19.041 --> 03:08:21.002]  I'm gonna take masses of calls.
[03:08:21.002 --> 03:08:24.383]  That means one an hour.
[03:08:24.383 --> 03:08:25.584]  In just a minute.
[03:08:25.584 --> 03:08:28.385]  But I gotta finish up with this, and I'm gonna go right to them, I promise.
[03:08:28.385 --> 03:08:34.748]  Okay, now listen to this Ninian guy before the city council, where in this town, in this state, it's like it used to be.
[03:08:34.748 --> 03:08:35.949]  And I used to read about trials.
[03:08:35.949 --> 03:08:40.151]  Everybody would go to trials, even in like 1920 and 30, all over the country.
[03:08:40.151 --> 03:08:41.551]  The famous Lindbergh trial.
[03:08:41.551 --> 03:08:42.572]  They all had their pistols.
[03:08:43.226 --> 03:08:47.630]  And that was back when the people were the boss, and you have no crime to really speak of.
[03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:52.215]  I mean, they would hype up, you know, bank robberies were like nationwide news.
[03:08:52.215 --> 03:08:57.240]  Because, I mean, crooks in this country, they were totally, it was just, you got hunted down.
[03:08:57.240 --> 03:09:00.383]  And the cops needed help, they'd knock on your door, help me get this guy.
[03:09:00.383 --> 03:09:03.646]  In fact, they demanded you help them back then, there was so much trust between people.
[03:09:04.392 --> 03:09:07.533]  I mean, you know, men didn't have to be... I mean, they were looking for a fugitive.
[03:09:07.533 --> 03:09:17.475]  Even when my mom was a little kid in Austin, people would get out of jail and have a jailbreak every once in a while, and the police would come driving down the street and, you know, they'd get out of their car and say, have you seen anybody?
[03:09:17.475 --> 03:09:18.075]  Come help us!
[03:09:18.075 --> 03:09:19.575]  Look for them!
[03:09:19.575 --> 03:09:20.696]  But see, now it's the opposite.
[03:09:20.696 --> 03:09:24.496]  It's look for imaginary terrorists, tattle on neighbors that spanked their kids.
[03:09:24.496 --> 03:09:31.318]  You know, it's stuff like that instead of, you never see the cops until there's a crime, and then the cops go crazy like fire ants looking for the criminal.
[03:09:31.918 --> 03:09:34.101]  Now they won't persecute or go after the criminals.
[03:09:34.101 --> 03:09:38.065]  40 inch slip, I want them to persecute the criminals.
[03:09:38.065 --> 03:09:39.706]  But they persecute us.
[03:09:39.706 --> 03:09:42.149]  By the way, what was that Grand Theft Auto edit yesterday?
[03:09:42.149 --> 03:09:43.030]  I want to play that audio.
[03:09:43.849 --> 03:09:47.071]  Uh, did you send that, uh... Aaron, could you give that to me?
[03:09:47.071 --> 03:09:48.292]  I want to play that later.
[03:09:48.292 --> 03:09:51.073]  Oh, okay, let's just go ahead and play this from the City Council.
[03:09:51.073 --> 03:09:53.875]  They got scanners at airports in control!
[03:09:53.875 --> 03:09:55.936]  I don't want citizens armed here!
[03:09:55.936 --> 03:09:57.577]  It's scary to me!
[03:09:57.577 --> 03:10:01.119]  It intimidates me to have citizens armed!
[03:10:01.119 --> 03:10:03.120]  Oh, it's horrible!
[03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:04.701]  So, uh, here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:06.140 --> 03:10:12.665]  I feel a little intimidated coming to a council meeting and seeing people with guns on their hips.
[03:10:12.665 --> 03:10:19.190]  You go to a courthouse or any other public building, you go to x-ray machines in your airports and everything else.
[03:10:19.190 --> 03:10:22.412]  You can't go to these places with guns.
[03:10:22.412 --> 03:10:24.934]  This is a government identity.
[03:10:24.934 --> 03:10:28.877]  I don't see why these men are standing here with sidearms.
[03:10:28.877 --> 03:10:30.979]  They're not police officers to my opinion.
[03:10:31.861 --> 03:10:33.962]  To me, I don't know the format of it.
[03:10:33.962 --> 03:10:36.984]  And probably the restaurant in the Dixon City, too.
[03:10:36.984 --> 03:10:38.285]  It's their business.
[03:10:38.285 --> 03:10:40.847]  They're serving public and family restaurants.
[03:10:40.847 --> 03:10:50.613]  Why should I go to a restaurant with my children or anything and see a guy sitting there with a sign that I'm... You guys are very intimidating standing there.
[03:10:50.613 --> 03:10:52.335]  And I don't believe you should be here.
[03:10:52.335 --> 03:10:52.835]  Thumbs up.
[03:10:53.938 --> 03:10:55.500]  Anything else?
[03:10:55.500 --> 03:10:57.301]  I'm not a member of the borough.
[03:10:57.301 --> 03:10:59.043]  I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[03:10:59.043 --> 03:11:03.327]  I'd like to ask for help, though, on a matter of greatest importance.
[03:11:03.327 --> 03:11:13.656]  As we know, on Friday, a group of my fellow organization members were barracked, oppressed, harassed, and violated by members of Colorado's police force.
[03:11:13.656 --> 03:11:20.462]  The officers involved perpetrated a systematic and calculated criminal violation of my fellow members' rights.
[03:11:21.770 --> 03:11:28.695]  They arrived at the Old Country Buffet in Dixon City responding to a call about people having a gun in the open.
[03:11:28.695 --> 03:11:38.942]  After arriving on scene, instead of ascertaining that no illegal activity was going on, they began to systematically remove patrons from the restaurant with no compelling reason to do so.
[03:11:38.942 --> 03:11:47.788]  As these innocent patrons' families watched and feared, these citizens were illegally detained, illegally searched, and had their possessions illegally seized.
[03:11:51.201 --> 03:11:55.102]  Alright, so, uh, that's basically what happened.
[03:11:55.102 --> 03:11:57.943]  And this is how they operate in the new system.
[03:11:57.943 --> 03:12:09.587]  Now, the media there was like, zooming in on these guys with sidearms, going, oh my gosh, and citizens are pointing like, oh, oh, oh, look at that guy!
[03:12:09.587 --> 03:12:20.391]  But then they see guys in black camo with their, with their pants bloused into their combat boots with German shepherds bugging their eyes out, and they go, oh, I feel so safe!
[03:12:21.087 --> 03:12:22.989]  And, and, this is so scary!
[03:12:22.989 --> 03:12:26.093]  Citizens of God!
[03:12:26.093 --> 03:12:28.376]  You understand the most dangerous thing in history is government?
[03:12:28.376 --> 03:12:30.559]  You understand statistically it's the most criminal thing?
[03:12:31.863 --> 03:12:37.667]  I mean, that's universally known in political science, that is an absolute fact, undebatable, undeniable.
[03:12:37.667 --> 03:12:40.769]  Psychopaths rotate towards law enforcement and towards government.
[03:12:40.769 --> 03:12:42.229]  Does that mean all of them are that?
[03:12:42.229 --> 03:12:42.450]  No.
[03:12:42.450 --> 03:12:44.451]  Does that mean even a large minority are?
[03:12:44.451 --> 03:12:45.411]  No.
[03:12:45.411 --> 03:12:51.455]  But does it mean that there is a key minority of them, many times more statistically than the general population?
[03:12:51.455 --> 03:12:52.736]  Yes.
[03:12:52.736 --> 03:12:57.339]  That's basic criminology, and I'm tired of the denials.
[03:12:58.968 --> 03:13:04.650]  We need to get back to the point where people... Now, now, now, I'll be honest with you.
[03:13:04.650 --> 03:13:15.893]  Quite frankly, it offends me when I see police going around with machine guns and with automatic, you know, semi-automatic rifles and in camo and armored vehicles.
[03:13:15.893 --> 03:13:17.294]  It is militarized.
[03:13:17.294 --> 03:13:18.554]  Like, if I go on a vacation
[03:13:19.512 --> 03:13:27.215]  I saw a thing on TV about cruise ships where they don't want to arm them against pirates that do get attacked sometimes, modern-day pirates, because it's offensive to people.
[03:13:27.215 --> 03:13:33.377]  They don't want to be seeing guys in black uniforms walking around with German Shepherds and machine guns when you're out on your cruise.
[03:13:33.377 --> 03:13:34.377]  You don't want to think about that.
[03:13:34.870 --> 03:13:36.332]  And I've been on a couple cruises, by the way.
[03:13:36.332 --> 03:13:37.813]  I wish I had time to go on one.
[03:13:37.813 --> 03:13:43.400]  But this was about, like, cruises off Africa where they get attacked, and Asia, you know, the big fancy ones.
[03:13:43.400 --> 03:13:46.143]  But, you know, people don't want to see that.
[03:13:46.143 --> 03:13:47.164]  They don't want to be around it.
[03:13:47.164 --> 03:13:50.067]  And it's not that I'm afraid of guns or don't like guns.
[03:13:50.067 --> 03:13:55.594]  You know, I mean, I know it was 50 years ago when I saw a cop in a nice fancy blue uniform, dressed nice, professional.
[03:13:56.292 --> 03:14:00.453]  See, that's why they put them in black monkey outfits with ball caps, so they don't act professional.
[03:14:00.453 --> 03:14:03.113]  Then I probably would feel good, actually.
[03:14:03.113 --> 03:14:06.934]  Because, you know, statistically back then, and I've looked at the numbers, they were a lot better.
[03:14:06.934 --> 03:14:10.795]  They weren't perfect, you still had some bad counties, but pretty much cops were good.
[03:14:10.795 --> 03:14:13.896]  That's why people liked them, and they were friendly, and they knew everybody.
[03:14:13.896 --> 03:14:18.557]  But man, when a crime happened, they went ape, because this is their community.
[03:14:18.557 --> 03:14:24.698]  But when they shifted away from that to revenue generation and law enforcement, and keeping the cattle in line,
[03:14:25.703 --> 03:14:28.024]  And it all gets into the whole philosophy, the rest of it.
[03:14:28.024 --> 03:14:34.407]  I mean, don't the police wish they wore nice uniforms, good-looking uniforms, instead of these monkey outfits you wear?
[03:14:34.407 --> 03:14:36.307]  I mean, I was looking at Canadian cops in Ottawa.
[03:14:36.307 --> 03:14:38.548]  They look sharp, like cops used to look here.
[03:14:38.548 --> 03:14:40.489]  They look like monkeys or something.
[03:14:40.489 --> 03:14:42.370]  But I'm already digressing.
[03:14:42.370 --> 03:14:46.091]  The point is, they know the psychology of how they dress you is how you behave.
[03:14:46.091 --> 03:14:48.832]  And I think I've said enough on this subject.
[03:14:48.832 --> 03:14:55.115]  It's just that the fact that we've gotten so domesticated, that we've come so far, that citizens shake in fear
[03:14:55.868 --> 03:14:56.970]  At the sight of guns.
[03:14:56.970 --> 03:14:59.215]  And I just want to give you an advisory in the U.S.
[03:14:59.215 --> 03:15:03.823]  A lot of cities arrest you a week after a library book is new and charge you with felonies.
[03:15:03.823 --> 03:15:06.669]  A lot of cities arrest you two days after your video's late.
[03:15:07.636 --> 03:15:09.637]  Because they need to arrest somebody, folks.
[03:15:09.637 --> 03:15:13.658]  They're not allowed to arrest the illegals, literally, for anything less than felonies.
[03:15:13.658 --> 03:15:15.338]  Drinking, driving, anything they're allowed to do it.
[03:15:15.338 --> 03:15:17.078]  No ID, no problem.
[03:15:17.078 --> 03:15:18.879]  They're supposed to leave them alone.
[03:15:18.879 --> 03:15:20.779]  And you're the fat cattle.
[03:15:20.779 --> 03:15:25.501]  So don't think just because you swiped your credit card that you paid for gas.
[03:15:25.501 --> 03:15:28.401]  Make sure you get a receipt or they'll SWAT team you.
[03:15:28.401 --> 03:15:29.882]  I see these cases every day, folks.
[03:15:29.882 --> 03:15:31.302]  I'm telling you about real problems here.
[03:15:32.737 --> 03:15:39.041]  If you are putting a rifle on the back of your car to go deer hunting, or to go to the range, I back my car in the garage.
[03:15:39.041 --> 03:15:45.304]  And it's not that I'm living in fear and a coward, it's just that these guys can go out on the vanguard and wear their guns on their sides.
[03:15:45.304 --> 03:15:51.227]  And I know in a way I'm giving in to the fear and the control by pulling my car in to load a gun.
[03:15:51.227 --> 03:15:53.708]  But I realize the chicken necks are dangerous, folks.
[03:15:53.708 --> 03:15:54.909]  The chicken necks are everywhere.
[03:15:55.612 --> 03:16:04.474]  And the cops have been trained to respond to any cowardly, I-see-a-box-on-the-side-of-the-highway, I think it's an Al-Qaeda nuclear bomb, with proton missiles.
[03:16:04.474 --> 03:16:08.815]  Uh, with dinosaurs, and Godzilla, and 17 flying saucers in it.
[03:16:08.815 --> 03:16:22.299]  But then real threats, like Mexican troops attacking, and cross-border wars, and more rocket attacks this week, and hand grenades, and mass death, and kidnappings, and slaughter, and dead cops, back of the paper.
[03:16:22.299 --> 03:16:23.239]  Everything is sick!
[03:16:24.173 --> 03:16:24.693]  It is!
[03:16:24.693 --> 03:16:27.215]  I'm living in an insane asylum!
[03:16:27.215 --> 03:16:30.457]  I keep saying it, I can't believe it!
[03:16:30.457 --> 03:16:42.426]  Meanwhile, the Austin Police are running around with robots looking at every cardboard box on the side of the road, freaking out on the news, training us all to ninny and run around imaginary Al-Qaeda groups.
[03:16:42.426 --> 03:16:43.406]  Alright, now I'm going to calls.
[03:16:43.406 --> 03:16:45.128]  Dave in California, go ahead, thanks for holding.
[03:16:45.128 --> 03:16:46.849]  Hi Alex, got two things.
[03:16:46.849 --> 03:16:51.612]  It's really important I need you to talk to Officer Boot, please, right away.
[03:16:51.612 --> 03:16:52.573]  Is he there?
[03:16:53.192 --> 03:16:54.254]  Officer Jackboot?
[03:16:54.254 --> 03:16:54.474]  Yes, sir.
[03:16:54.474 --> 03:16:57.559]  You're trying to conjure Officer Jackboot?
[03:16:57.559 --> 03:17:02.267]  Mirror, mirror on the wall, show me the Jackabootist of them all!
[03:17:04.997 --> 03:17:06.977]  You want to talk to Officer Jack Boot?
[03:17:06.977 --> 03:17:07.598]  Yes sir!
[03:17:07.598 --> 03:17:23.640]  Hold on, I've got to like go back to an imaginary childhood of being a bully who finally got beat up by kids that I used to beat up and I'm a bully and I'm cowardly but I'm into acting masculine and I like black uniforms and primitive trappings of power and I had a lot of vaccines when I was little so my IQ is about 75.
[03:17:23.640 --> 03:17:28.901]  Hold on.
[03:17:28.901 --> 03:17:32.202]  I don't know, I just don't feel Officer Jack Boot coming.
[03:17:32.202 --> 03:17:33.102]  Hold on, hold on.
[03:17:35.589 --> 03:17:40.753]  You don't tell me, boy, what to do on my own show!
[03:17:40.753 --> 03:17:44.815]  Officer Buda, I have something really important to report to you, sir.
[03:17:44.815 --> 03:17:47.577]  Please take my report.
[03:17:47.577 --> 03:17:51.420]  Shut up!
[03:17:51.420 --> 03:17:53.621]  But there's boxes!
[03:17:53.621 --> 03:17:54.142]  Boxes?
[03:17:54.910 --> 03:17:56.651]  Where'd you see this box?
[03:17:56.651 --> 03:17:59.792]  Three days ago, sir, at the College of the Redwoods.
[03:17:59.792 --> 03:18:00.752]  Hold on!
[03:18:00.752 --> 03:18:02.873]  Hold on, let me get the dispatcher!
[03:18:02.873 --> 03:18:03.794]  We saw a box!
[03:18:03.794 --> 03:18:04.734]  Where was this?
[03:18:04.734 --> 03:18:05.894]  Was it at Al-Qaeda?
[03:18:05.894 --> 03:18:07.995]  Did you see Bin Laden?
[03:18:07.995 --> 03:18:10.856]  Was he riding a flying carpet?
[03:18:10.856 --> 03:18:11.557]  No, sir.
[03:18:11.557 --> 03:18:13.037]  You're a good citizen.
[03:18:13.037 --> 03:18:15.358]  You want to kiss up to me and act scared?
[03:18:15.358 --> 03:18:16.619]  Yes, sir.
[03:18:16.619 --> 03:18:18.559]  That's better.
[03:18:18.559 --> 03:18:19.160]  But it was... It's a box!
[03:18:23.437 --> 03:18:24.157]  Oh, man.
[03:18:24.157 --> 03:18:25.698]  Good to hear from you, Dave.
[03:18:25.698 --> 03:18:27.939]  I really appreciate it.
[03:18:27.939 --> 03:18:29.999]  But we have to learn to be ninnying and afraid.
[03:18:29.999 --> 03:18:33.280]  Leo and Mash, you're on the Insane Asylum program.
[03:18:33.280 --> 03:18:35.881]  Pretty soon, I'm going to start going, Leeda!
[03:18:35.881 --> 03:18:36.742]  Myself.
[03:18:36.742 --> 03:18:38.442]  Go ahead.
[03:18:38.442 --> 03:18:41.003]  Lower the blood pressure.
[03:18:41.003 --> 03:18:42.203]  Hello, sir.
[03:18:42.203 --> 03:18:43.604]  Yeah.
[03:18:43.604 --> 03:18:47.645]  I sent you a little thing under movie concepts.
[03:18:47.645 --> 03:18:49.706]  Did you read that on the tips line?
[03:18:50.968 --> 03:18:52.028]  I'm sure one of us did.
[03:18:52.028 --> 03:18:54.709]  I'm wallowing in data, but tell me about it.
[03:18:54.709 --> 03:19:04.412]  Yeah, it's basically... I wrote, uh, collaborate with, uh, Katherine Albrecht of Spy Chips in an unauthorized makeover of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[03:19:04.412 --> 03:19:06.153]  Use both versions.
[03:19:06.153 --> 03:19:17.536]  With all relevant links to factual data, I should be a visible runner running at the bottom of the frame, interspersed throughout the movie, and use enough material, time-wise, to warrant a legal case, i.e.
[03:19:17.536 --> 03:19:19.777]  go way over contemporary limits of free usage.
[03:19:20.470 --> 03:19:29.636]  Well, that is a nice hypothetical scenario, but I don't think I could even make a live-action Body Snatchers, much less get along with the people that I would be making it with.
[03:19:29.636 --> 03:19:32.157]  And I like Catherine, but you know,
[03:19:45.265 --> 03:19:45.785]  Everything's nannying.

[03:20:18.911 --> 03:20:19.592]  We're good to go.
[03:20:45.615 --> 03:20:58.759]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[03:20:58.759 --> 03:21:09.822]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation, in which family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:21:09.822 --> 03:21:12.063]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose,
[03:21:13.243 --> 03:21:14.984]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[03:21:14.984 --> 03:21:21.127]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[03:21:45.433 --> 03:21:52.096]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:21:52.096 --> 03:22:00.219]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:00.219 --> 03:22:08.062]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:22:08.382 --> 03:22:13.485]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:13.485 --> 03:22:18.687]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:18.687 --> 03:22:23.049]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[03:23:51.781 --> 03:23:55.823]  I drove through LaGrange just the other day.
[03:23:55.823 --> 03:23:58.184]  You know, I like ZZ Top.
[03:23:58.184 --> 03:24:04.867]  Even though it's George Bush's favorite band.
[03:24:23.869 --> 03:24:26.772]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[03:24:26.772 --> 03:24:28.774]  Leo and Matt, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:24:28.774 --> 03:24:32.137]  Hello?
[03:24:32.137 --> 03:24:33.318]  Yes, Leo.
[03:24:33.318 --> 03:24:38.623]  Yeah, also, I got a song for Willie I just wrote.
[03:24:38.623 --> 03:24:41.526]  How do I mail it to him?
[03:24:41.526 --> 03:24:44.029]  Listen, Leo, I appreciate your call.
[03:24:44.029 --> 03:24:48.073]  I guess I do have Willie's mailing address, but it's the same one that's on there.
[03:24:48.905 --> 03:24:53.126]  Peace Group website, so I'm not really the agent to get to Willie Nelson through.
[03:24:53.126 --> 03:24:54.506]  Kyle in Iowa.
[03:24:54.506 --> 03:24:55.066]  You're on the air.
[03:24:55.066 --> 03:24:55.446]  Go ahead.
[03:24:55.446 --> 03:24:58.407]  Hi, Alex.
[03:24:58.407 --> 03:24:59.047]  How's it going?
[03:24:59.047 --> 03:24:59.267]  Good.
[03:24:59.267 --> 03:25:00.147]  Thanks for holding, Kyle.
[03:25:00.147 --> 03:25:01.007]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:25:01.007 --> 03:25:02.548]  What's on your mind?
[03:25:02.548 --> 03:25:05.828]  Well, I got two things I want to talk about quick.
[03:25:05.828 --> 03:25:14.710]  The first comment I want to make is that I think we all might need to start thinking in terms of us being dead men walking.
[03:25:14.710 --> 03:25:17.151]  That way we can kind of let go and just do what needs to be done.
[03:25:18.604 --> 03:25:19.584]  You know, whatever that means.
[03:25:19.584 --> 03:25:32.067]  Well, we need everybody in universities to find out if they do have programs where they're mass-injecting potatoes and things to be shipped to Africa, quote, with vaccines to help the children, to find out actually what's in there, and that could be a big breaking story.
[03:25:32.067 --> 03:25:40.909]  I mean, we know they've been caught already doing that, and that's been in the news, but, you know, you get a call like that, I start wanting to jump on a plane and go investigate.
[03:25:40.909 --> 03:25:42.049]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:25:42.049 --> 03:25:47.570]  The other thing I wanted to talk about, though, is I actually live here in Cedar Falls, slash,
[03:25:48.999 --> 03:25:53.721]  Waterloo with these camp drills that are going on.
[03:25:53.721 --> 03:26:03.565]  And, you know, I've been paying attention to the local media and everything, and I noticed the day that the raid was announced, I just caught the tail end of it just before I was going to bed.
[03:26:03.565 --> 03:26:06.426]  I was flipping through the channels on Discovery Channel.
[03:26:06.426 --> 03:26:09.728]  It appeared that they had some pro-immigration piece on there.
[03:26:09.728 --> 03:26:12.029]  And then on the local news, they also had
[03:26:12.967 --> 03:26:20.689]  You know, a bleeding heart pro-immigration piece on there where everyone was crying, and all these poor people and everything.
[03:26:20.689 --> 03:26:31.233]  And in a way, I do feel bad for them, but at the same time... Well, no, this is a very sophisticated PSYOP, so I haven't really even gotten into how they're doing it, but let me try to get into the basics of how the psychology works.
[03:26:31.233 --> 03:26:38.455]  They had a Washington Post article with the headline that non-psychiatric patients being drugged by federal government.
[03:26:39.213 --> 03:26:40.553]  And I've got the headliner.
[03:26:40.553 --> 03:26:41.594]  That's not the exact headline.
[03:26:41.594 --> 03:26:45.575]  I never even got to it yesterday because I wanted to flesh it out if I did cover it.
[03:26:45.575 --> 03:27:04.760]  And it basically said in there that what they were doing is that if somebody cries or resists, they inject them with like a sedative, a pretty serious antipsychotic, and then the cops lean over it said viciously and say, night, night.
[03:27:05.786 --> 03:27:11.708]  And it actually does sound kind of sadistic, and it does sound kind of creepy, but that's better than being tasered.
[03:27:11.708 --> 03:27:13.908]  So a citizen just says, well, officer, I wasn't speeding.
[03:27:13.908 --> 03:27:15.649]  They go, that's it, you're tasered.
[03:27:15.649 --> 03:27:20.230]  Or, officer, please, and the officer says, don't beg to me, that's a threat, I'm tasering you.
[03:27:20.230 --> 03:27:24.071]  Or throws a guy out of a wheelchair, you know, who's paralyzed.
[03:27:24.071 --> 03:27:26.112]  You know, they treat us worse.
[03:27:26.112 --> 03:27:33.074]  But imagine, if they did that to a citizen, it'd be how good it was for the officer's safety, and it's very humane to inject them with the, uh,
[03:27:33.809 --> 03:27:50.651]  With the, uh, you know, anti-psychotics, the Thorazine, uh, so, but with the illegals, it's all the officer then sinisterly leaned over and said, nighty night, when actually probably like a joke, nighty night, because it said the person was fighting him.
[03:27:51.534 --> 03:27:53.395]  Uh, which they actually could have done something then.
[03:27:53.395 --> 03:27:57.396]  Uh, and I'm not even condoning it, though it's on the edge of being condoned.
[03:27:57.396 --> 03:28:09.000]  You know, they're, I mean, they catch you in Mexico, they run your credit, suck every bit of money out of your family, put you in a dirt floor jail where they beat you up and rape you, they torture you with Tabasco up the nose.
[03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:09.720]  That's their favorite.
[03:28:09.720 --> 03:28:11.721]  I mean, I mean, folks, I know there's some people I know.
[03:28:11.721 --> 03:28:18.323]  I mean, Mexico is so corrupt, it's just, uh, it's called Little Bite or, um, Mordidas.
[03:28:19.063 --> 03:28:21.084]  And then you just, I've paid the cops off myself.
[03:28:21.084 --> 03:28:24.765]  They just pull you over and they're guarding all the marijuana fields out there while you're driving around.
[03:28:24.765 --> 03:28:27.546]  They walk over and they go, you're speeding.
[03:28:27.546 --> 03:28:29.086]  You go, no, I wasn't speeding.
[03:28:29.086 --> 03:28:32.848]  And they go, no, you go to jail.
[03:28:32.848 --> 03:28:35.769]  And then you go, okay, well, here's how many pesos do you want?
[03:28:35.769 --> 03:28:37.529]  And they go, I want this many.
[03:28:37.529 --> 03:28:38.249]  And then you pay them.
[03:28:38.249 --> 03:28:42.971]  I mean, that's, you know, uh, so, uh, yeah, no, it's very sophisticated.
[03:28:43.792 --> 03:28:47.616]  But again, they've admitted they're letting most of the illegals go.
[03:28:47.616 --> 03:28:49.778]  That was in the Des Moines Register, or whatever your paper is.
[03:28:49.778 --> 03:28:51.139]  I've got the article right here.
[03:28:51.139 --> 03:28:55.103]  It said they're letting most of them go and saying, well, you promised to come back later.
[03:28:55.103 --> 03:29:01.590]  They're showing us camps and cattle shoots to set the image, and that's not my opinion.
[03:29:01.590 --> 03:29:03.472]  I have the federal documents, so you're absolutely right.
[03:29:05.606 --> 03:29:07.648]  Anything else, Kyle?
[03:29:07.648 --> 03:29:08.668]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:29:08.668 --> 03:29:09.889]  I got a point I want to make about all that.
[03:29:09.889 --> 03:29:10.410]  Stay there.
[03:29:10.410 --> 03:29:10.790]  Stay there.
[03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:14.733]  And then I'm going to play this Grand Theft Auto parody piece.
[03:29:14.733 --> 03:29:19.557]  And for Prison Planet.tv members, you'll be able to see this coming up after we talk to Kyle.
[03:29:19.557 --> 03:29:24.501]  Then I'm going to talk to Christian, Dave, Billy Bob, and others.
[03:29:24.501 --> 03:29:25.121]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:29:25.121 --> 03:29:31.426]  Got a bunch of other news here we haven't gotten to as well, but I've done a pretty good job today of covering a lot of it.
[03:29:31.426 --> 03:29:32.007]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:35.560 --> 03:29:39.486]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:39.486 --> 03:29:42.170]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:45.609 --> 03:29:48.712]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:29:48.712 --> 03:29:54.236]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:29:54.236 --> 03:29:59.961]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:29:59.961 --> 03:30:01.442]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:30:01.442 --> 03:30:10.329]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:30:10.749 --> 03:30:12.591]  Now, compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[03:30:47.127 --> 03:30:49.927]  A new world order.
[03:30:49.927 --> 03:30:54.308]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:30:54.833 --> 03:30:57.654]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[03:30:57.654 --> 03:31:00.455]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:31:00.455 --> 03:31:03.617]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:31:03.617 --> 03:31:10.940]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:31:13.971 --> 03:31:19.415]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:31:19.415 --> 03:31:22.737]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:31:22.737 --> 03:31:25.859]  The old America's making great progress toward a world government.
[03:31:25.859 --> 03:31:27.020]  Most people have no idea.
[03:31:27.020 --> 03:31:27.820]  They're not after money.
[03:31:27.820 --> 03:31:29.081]  They have all the money they need.
[03:31:29.081 --> 03:31:30.062]  They're after power.
[03:31:30.062 --> 03:31:31.223]  That's what they're after these years.

[03:33:35.404 --> 03:33:37.245]  Alright, I'll quit acting stupid.
[03:33:37.245 --> 03:33:41.487]  I got an audience of like two out the window here and I'm acting stupid for them.
[03:33:41.487 --> 03:33:45.248]  You gotta have some fun with this sometimes, this is insane.
[03:33:45.248 --> 03:33:49.170]  I'm telling you, it's an... I keep saying it, I just can't believe it!
[03:33:49.170 --> 03:33:53.872]  Alright, Kyle in Iowa, say whatever you want, I'll try to... Shut up, go ahead.
[03:33:53.872 --> 03:33:57.674]  Well, Alex, first I must say that your air guitar skills are unmatched.
[03:33:57.674 --> 03:34:01.636]  Um, but I want to make a general point about this whole immigration thing.
[03:34:02.423 --> 03:34:03.664]  And I don't remember where I read it.
[03:34:03.664 --> 03:34:19.896]  I want to say it was either the Waterloo Courier or the Des Moines Register, but I read something about how there was, uh, they had some tip-off like a year or two ago about all the illegal immigrants being there because there's apparently a meth lab at one of these meatpacking plants.
[03:34:19.896 --> 03:34:22.858]  I'm just kind of shooting from the hip here, so I might have some of my details.
[03:34:22.858 --> 03:34:25.180]  No, no, I'm reading and I've got the articles here.
[03:34:25.180 --> 03:34:29.203]  Okay, well, the point is, is, A, why are they letting a meth lab
[03:34:29.861 --> 03:34:35.968]  You know, stick around for a year or two, and I'll tell you something about it, and why didn't they get rid of the illegal immigrants then?
[03:34:35.968 --> 03:34:38.471]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[03:34:38.471 --> 03:34:39.973]  I mean, it's flat out a mistake.
[03:34:39.973 --> 03:34:40.454]  It's a fraud.
[03:34:40.454 --> 03:34:43.437]  I mean, they're pretty much admitting to being criminally negligent.
[03:34:43.437 --> 03:34:45.019]  This is why it's a fraud.
[03:34:45.019 --> 03:34:47.863]  Let's take their official number of 16 million illegals.
[03:34:48.718 --> 03:34:59.902]  It's really like 35 million, that was a year ago, and the government actually has real numbers on that, that's where we get those, because the census admits that about half the illegals actually report themselves, so they estimate it's twice that, so what's twice?
[03:34:59.902 --> 03:35:01.783]  15, 16 million, 30-something mil.
[03:35:01.783 --> 03:35:08.566]  And that's a few years old, as I was saying, what, 2006, almost two years old now, a year and a half old.
[03:35:08.566 --> 03:35:15.268]  They'll go out every four or five months, and they'll raid a few meatpacking plants, and you'll hear about 1,100 arrests, 200 arrests, 500 arrests, the biggest I've ever seen is 1,100.
[03:35:17.697 --> 03:35:19.238]  And they'll go, man, getting tough!
[03:35:19.238 --> 03:35:20.319]  Wowzers!
[03:35:20.319 --> 03:35:26.803]  And it's always some smaller meat packing division, not Tyson or somebody else, so it's actually even getting rid of some competition.
[03:35:26.803 --> 03:35:28.184]  The globalists are masters at this.
[03:35:28.184 --> 03:35:29.985]  They don't go after the big boys.
[03:35:29.985 --> 03:35:32.266]  And then the media's like, man, they're getting tough.
[03:35:32.266 --> 03:35:39.031]  If you've got 3 million illegals coming in a year, at 900 plus thousand, it's right close to a million legals.
[03:35:39.031 --> 03:35:41.993]  So that's almost 4 million coming in a year.
[03:35:41.993 --> 03:35:45.315]  And every few months they're arresting a thousand people, maybe.
[03:35:46.426 --> 03:35:49.348]  Uh, in the big raids and a few thousand, you can go look the numbers up.
[03:35:49.348 --> 03:35:57.634]  Just like earlier, I said the average time's 11 minutes, uh, for, uh, because I go from the, these statistics, but then I want to be careful that my memory fails sometimes.
[03:35:57.634 --> 03:36:03.438]  I said 11 minutes was the average, and that, he looked it up online, and that's what they say, 11 minutes for a 911 call.
[03:36:03.438 --> 03:36:14.686]  My info is, uh, and, and let's look this up right now, let's fact check me, um, that, uh, I, I think the ice only,
[03:36:15.635 --> 03:36:21.999]  Picks up inside the country something like 2,000 people a month.
[03:36:21.999 --> 03:36:26.543]  Now, at the border, they intercept, I think it's more than 20,000.
[03:36:26.543 --> 03:36:31.486]  So let me see, 20,000 at the border, which they say is one out of ten they're catching.
[03:36:31.486 --> 03:36:36.469]  20,000 at the border, and then at the borders, and then a couple thousand a month.
[03:36:36.469 --> 03:36:38.110]  So they're arresting a couple thousand.
[03:36:38.110 --> 03:36:39.852]  So what's 12 times a couple thousand?
[03:36:39.852 --> 03:36:42.393]  Let's say 24,000 a year they're arresting.
[03:36:42.393 --> 03:36:44.575]  And again, I'm going off numbers I saw years ago.
[03:36:45.479 --> 03:36:45.960]  24,000.
[03:36:45.960 --> 03:36:51.744]  So, if they're arresting 24,000, but 4 million are coming in, 3 million of them illegal.
[03:36:51.744 --> 03:36:58.289]  You see, that's like trying to ladle out a swimming pool with a teaspoon.
[03:36:58.289 --> 03:37:03.814]  And oh my gosh, they are, you know, you have to prosecute the employers.
[03:37:03.814 --> 03:37:06.856]  And folks, if they want to do that, they could instantly.
[03:37:06.856 --> 03:37:14.502]  ICE would come in, and they would visit in one day 20 Austin businesses, and they would go in, and there'd be illegal aliens in every kitchen.
[03:37:15.279 --> 03:37:31.529]  And then you'd arrest those people and deport them, and then you would put felony charges, and this is treason, so it should be felony charges, on all these businesses, and then you do that once a month for a year, then nobody's gonna hire illegals in Austin, Texas.
[03:37:31.529 --> 03:37:32.150]  Cured.
[03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.770]  Done.
[03:37:32.770 --> 03:37:33.430]  Finished.
[03:37:33.430 --> 03:37:34.091]  Easy.
[03:37:34.091 --> 03:37:35.492]  Not even that much enforcement.
[03:37:35.492 --> 03:37:42.636]  How many officers would you need to do a ten raids once a month?
[03:37:42.636 --> 03:37:43.597]  I mean, five guys?
[03:37:44.929 --> 03:37:45.790]  Not many.
[03:37:45.790 --> 03:37:48.271]  Yeah, see, no, no, no, they're not going to do that.
[03:37:48.271 --> 03:37:49.792]  Go ahead.
[03:37:49.792 --> 03:38:08.645]  Oh, well, you know, I guess another little thing I'd like to add on there too, it's like, it just dawned on me, but just even growing up around here, it's always been well known there's been tons of Mexicans that work at all these meatpacking plants, so it's like, I doubt I'm in the privilege of some special knowledge that
[03:38:09.494 --> 03:38:25.685]  No one but illegals works at them because you used to get twenty bucks an hour, a skilled union job, and now they get five, six bucks an hour, and the illegals will not work with a gringo or a Mayatta once they take over.
[03:38:25.685 --> 03:38:27.987]  Now, I'm not being mean to the illegal aliens.
[03:38:27.987 --> 03:38:28.547]  It's a fact.
[03:38:28.547 --> 03:38:31.069]  There's now been newscast in LA admitting it.
[03:38:31.069 --> 03:38:36.773]  I know cooks in LA who can't get hired anywhere because it's a, we look out for Raza first,
[03:38:37.353 --> 03:38:43.938]  Now, not American Hispanics, they're great folks, but the illegals, it's a very, one of the most nationalistic countries in the world is Mexico.
[03:38:43.938 --> 03:38:46.680]  And they come in, they take over, they only hire their people.
[03:38:46.680 --> 03:38:49.142]  I mean, you think white folks were bad in the 50s doing this?
[03:38:49.142 --> 03:38:56.328]  My gosh, the Latin Americans, especially the Mexicans, I mean, they bring it down to a fine art of only hiring their people.
[03:38:56.328 --> 03:39:04.894]  There's almost no blacks now in the janitorial business, almost no blacks in farm work all over the country, and it's just absolutely amazing.
[03:39:04.894 --> 03:39:05.895]  So you don't work.
[03:39:06.679 --> 03:39:10.601]  And the employers tell you now, don't speak Spanish, you can't work on this meatpacking line.
[03:39:10.601 --> 03:39:12.262]  You can't work at this print shop.
[03:39:12.262 --> 03:39:14.463]  I've got a Spanish shop.
[03:39:14.463 --> 03:39:16.744]  And so it's also the language.
[03:39:16.744 --> 03:39:20.426]  And then that drives the wages down in all those key communities.
[03:39:20.426 --> 03:39:30.811]  Take the truck drivers, all the Hispanic truck drivers I know, and I know quite a few, they come out to our rallies and they're like, oh yeah, I've gone from, you know, $20 an hour to $9 an hour and I'm bankrupt and my life's over.
[03:39:30.811 --> 03:39:32.231]  You know, it's over, folks!
[03:39:32.231 --> 03:39:35.093]  Because the illegal aliens are now doing it.
[03:39:35.093 --> 03:39:35.713]  Thank you for the call.
[03:39:36.986 --> 03:39:38.867]  And, uh, does that help Mexicans?
[03:39:38.867 --> 03:39:39.187]  No.
[03:39:39.187 --> 03:39:44.248]  That ends up turning us into Mexico instead of them having a revolution down there when they got triple the resources the U.S.
[03:39:44.248 --> 03:39:44.808]  has.
[03:39:44.808 --> 03:39:46.489]  Gold, silver, oil.
[03:39:46.489 --> 03:39:50.410]  Just, it's... The place is a heaven.
[03:39:50.410 --> 03:39:52.671]  They got more billionaires than we got in the U.S.
[03:39:52.671 --> 03:39:54.071]  Did you know that?
[03:39:54.071 --> 03:39:56.432]  They got money coming out their ears!
[03:39:56.432 --> 03:39:58.533]  And they export all their criminals.
[03:39:58.533 --> 03:40:00.933]  You kill somebody in Mexico, you just come to the U.S.
[03:40:00.933 --> 03:40:03.654]  Kill somebody in the U.S., go down to Mexico.
[03:40:03.654 --> 03:40:05.855]  And we kicked Mexico's butt two times.
[03:40:07.148 --> 03:40:10.451]  Actually, three times if you count when they attacked us with the German Army in 1918.
[03:40:10.451 --> 03:40:14.814]  And, oh boy, you're not supposed to teach that in the school books.
[03:40:14.814 --> 03:40:17.716]  You know, Mexico attacking us and murdering a bunch of people.
[03:40:17.716 --> 03:40:19.237]  And I'm tired of it.
[03:40:19.237 --> 03:40:23.340]  And I will get on air and say they worked with the Germans to attack this country.
[03:40:23.340 --> 03:40:27.463]  Of course, the Texas Rangers kicked their, you know what, I just can't handle it.
[03:40:27.463 --> 03:40:29.564]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[03:40:29.564 --> 03:40:30.705]  I'm sorry we keep winning.
[03:40:30.705 --> 03:40:32.847]  I'm sorry, you know.
[03:40:32.847 --> 03:40:34.448]  Why don't you get your own country back?
[03:40:35.345 --> 03:40:40.569]  I mean, I'm not gonna play along with the fact that, oh, Mexico loves us, and Mexico's sweet, and it's a friendly thing.
[03:40:40.569 --> 03:40:41.409]  No, it's not!
[03:40:41.409 --> 03:40:44.511]  It's, you're gonna die, gringo, we're gonna kill all whites.
[03:40:44.511 --> 03:40:46.713]  Plan of San Diego.
[03:40:46.713 --> 03:40:52.597]  And then that's very painful, because I have a lot of Hispanic friends that could care less about having Mexicans around me.
[03:40:52.597 --> 03:40:54.518]  As long as they don't hate me.
[03:40:54.518 --> 03:40:56.039]  As long as they're red, white, and blue.
[03:40:56.039 --> 03:40:59.562]  And I know when a Mexican American's red, white, and blue, they're as red, white, and blue as anybody.
[03:40:59.562 --> 03:41:00.903]  Or more so.
[03:41:00.903 --> 03:41:04.185]  But I don't like the fact that I'm supposed to play along
[03:41:06.114 --> 03:41:13.739]  And I know a lot of Mexicans call me and tell me, oh yeah, man, you're right, I hear it all the time, you know, Mexican-Americans, and I'm just not going to play along with it anymore.
[03:41:13.739 --> 03:41:19.162]  I mean, I'm not going to sit and wait about killing me, and now you're going to gut my country and the New World Order is bringing you in.
[03:41:19.162 --> 03:41:20.783]  I fight everything the New World Order does.
[03:41:20.783 --> 03:41:22.264]  They're for abortion, I'm against it.
[03:41:22.264 --> 03:41:23.765]  They're for open borders, I'm against it.
[03:41:23.765 --> 03:41:25.766]  They're for gun bans, I'm against it.
[03:41:25.766 --> 03:41:29.989]  They're for having foreign water companies take over our water, I'm against it.
[03:41:29.989 --> 03:41:31.630]  Anything they're for, I'm against it.
[03:41:31.630 --> 03:41:32.531]  It's real simple.
[03:41:33.487 --> 03:41:33.927]  What's up Alex?
[03:41:33.927 --> 03:41:35.468]  I just want to thank you for doing everything.
[03:41:35.468 --> 03:41:42.832]  To what you were just saying, I just was trying to get a temporary job at a warehouse.
[03:41:55.618 --> 03:42:01.002]  And normally, you know, when I do the temporary thing in the summertime, it usually takes me about a day to get a job.
[03:42:01.002 --> 03:42:02.683]  Well, this time it took me like three weeks.
[03:42:02.683 --> 03:42:05.424]  And when I went in there, it was all illegal immigrants.
[03:42:05.424 --> 03:42:06.385]  I'm in California.
[03:42:06.385 --> 03:42:09.927]  So it was like, it was, I really seen the first hand effects of it.
[03:42:09.927 --> 03:42:10.688]  It was like crazy.
[03:42:11.847 --> 03:42:17.572]  No, I've got a lot of friends who've got college degrees and, you know, and computer programming and things.
[03:42:17.572 --> 03:42:22.976]  Most of the factories are shut down around here, and Austin's a booming city, and there's a lot of them shutting down.
[03:42:22.976 --> 03:42:29.301]  And, you know, they're at HEB, and then they'll work another job mowing yards, and they work for the illegals now.
[03:42:29.301 --> 03:42:36.166]  And they're lucky, and they'll laugh at them and call them the gringo, and they get to work under the illegal aliens, and that's how it works now.
[03:42:36.166 --> 03:42:38.888]  And they not only do that, they don't even like
[03:42:39.375 --> 03:42:43.218]  Mexicans that consider themselves American and don't speak Spanish.
[03:42:43.218 --> 03:42:45.160]  I mean, is that you?
[03:42:45.160 --> 03:42:46.481]  So is that you?
[03:42:46.481 --> 03:42:48.682]  No, I'm not.
[03:42:48.682 --> 03:42:49.683]  Not me.
[03:42:49.683 --> 03:42:51.324]  But I'm saying, are you Hispanic?
[03:42:51.324 --> 03:42:52.065]  No, I'm not Hispanic.
[03:42:52.065 --> 03:42:52.866]  I'm African American.
[03:42:52.866 --> 03:42:55.848]  But I mean, you've seen that, because yes, I've certainly seen that.
[03:42:55.848 --> 03:42:57.189]  Yeah, I've seen that.
[03:42:57.189 --> 03:43:03.054]  I've got a lot of, you know, Mexican friends that tell me, you know, they don't like, I forgot what they call them.
[03:43:03.054 --> 03:43:04.215]  You know what they call them.
[03:43:04.215 --> 03:43:07.377]  You know what the Mexicans, Mexican Americans call Mexicans.
[03:43:07.377 --> 03:43:08.458]  Let's just not say it on air.
[03:43:09.125 --> 03:43:10.285]  Yeah, not that I don't care.
[03:43:10.285 --> 03:43:13.166]  But, you know, they say they don't like him or whatever because of that reason.
[03:43:13.166 --> 03:43:20.887]  So it's kind of like, that's kind of crazy to me, like, to think that, you know, they're... Well, that's because Mexicans aren't stupid.
[03:43:20.887 --> 03:43:26.868]  And, in fact, on average, they're smarter, I mean, wiser than Americans, and I appreciate your call.
[03:43:26.868 --> 03:43:28.308]  Anything else you wanted to add?
[03:43:28.308 --> 03:43:31.669]  Oh, yeah, and I just wanted to say, actually, I got a comment.
[03:43:31.669 --> 03:43:36.470]  I wanted to say that, you know, to the listeners, everybody, if you really, because I was listening, yes, I listen every day.
[03:43:36.470 --> 03:43:38.270]  So I was listening yesterday, and I was seeing how
[03:43:38.820 --> 03:43:42.321]  You know, they were trying to get divisive with the religion and stuff.
[03:43:42.321 --> 03:43:50.084]  Everybody needed to, like, really read the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and really read what the Founding Fathers were, like, really trying to teach.
[03:43:50.084 --> 03:43:54.386]  It was like a, uh, you know, it was more of a, um, how do you say?
[03:43:54.386 --> 03:43:57.967]  Uh, what is it?
[03:43:57.967 --> 03:44:04.689]  It was founded on Christian principles, but it was secular government, so you wouldn't get one church cult running everything.
[03:44:04.689 --> 03:44:06.430]  Yeah, it was more of a tolerance.
[03:44:07.267 --> 03:44:15.391]  So you guys, I mean, if you... Well, no, that's because they lived under religious nuts that wouldn't let them practice their religion, so they came here to have freedom.
[03:44:15.391 --> 03:44:16.412]  You're absolutely right, sir.
[03:44:16.412 --> 03:44:17.332]  Nail on the head.
[03:44:17.332 --> 03:44:18.633]  Yeah, I mean, I say this.
[03:44:18.633 --> 03:44:24.456]  I've talked to the radical Mexican groups before, and I've been like, listen, man, I don't mind Hispanics.
[03:44:24.456 --> 03:44:25.536]  I like Hispanic people.
[03:44:25.536 --> 03:44:31.499]  You know, I just, stop saying you want to kill me and stop saying you're going to get us and, you know, why is it okay for you to say that?
[03:44:31.499 --> 03:44:32.920]  And they'll laugh and go, listen, gringo.
[03:44:33.857 --> 03:44:36.699]  You know, you know we don't like you, and you don't like us.
[03:44:36.699 --> 03:44:38.920]  And I go, no, I don't dislike you.
[03:44:38.920 --> 03:44:40.641]  And I said, I'm not going to be part of this.
[03:44:40.641 --> 03:44:43.983]  And they go, it doesn't matter what you want, gringo.
[03:44:43.983 --> 03:44:46.144]  We're taking over and we're going to get you.
[03:44:46.144 --> 03:44:48.046]  And I say, well, the New World Order is engineering all this.
[03:44:48.046 --> 03:44:49.587]  He goes, we'll get them too.
[03:44:49.587 --> 03:44:51.027]  You're not going to get anybody.
[03:44:51.027 --> 03:44:53.449]  You can't even get your own Mexican government down there.
[03:44:53.449 --> 03:44:54.329]  And I'm not blaming you.
[03:44:54.329 --> 03:44:58.552]  They got weapons and machine guns and armored vehicles, and it's incredibly corrupt society.
[03:44:59.681 --> 03:45:03.784]  It's just that I would support Mexican independence if they had a true republic government.
[03:45:03.784 --> 03:45:08.928]  I mean, if they had people in Mexico that truly wanted liberty and freedom and were rebelling against their country, I'd support them.
[03:45:08.928 --> 03:45:09.909]  I'd say, send them money.
[03:45:09.909 --> 03:45:11.210]  I'd try to support them.
[03:45:11.210 --> 03:45:13.952]  I'd probably go down there and fight with them.
[03:45:13.952 --> 03:45:15.613]  I mean, frankly, I like Latin Americans.
[03:45:15.613 --> 03:45:17.655]  I mean, you know, it's interesting people.
[03:45:17.655 --> 03:45:23.279]  You know, a mix of Mesoamericans, Spanish, Portuguese, African.
[03:45:24.720 --> 03:45:28.683]  Irish, German, it's just an interesting, nice, hard-working family people.
[03:45:28.683 --> 03:45:29.823]  They don't like the New World Order.
[03:45:29.823 --> 03:45:31.104]  They don't trust vaccines.
[03:45:31.104 --> 03:45:35.847]  When CPS comes for Mexican kids who are Mexican, they just leave.
[03:45:35.847 --> 03:45:36.748]  Their kids come first.
[03:45:36.748 --> 03:45:38.449]  They just leave and go to another town.
[03:45:38.449 --> 03:45:39.570]  They go to Mexico.
[03:45:39.570 --> 03:45:41.391]  Their kids are number one.
[03:45:41.391 --> 03:45:43.773]  Not conditioned blacks, whites, and American Mexicans.
[03:45:43.773 --> 03:45:45.454]  We just, oh, have our baby.
[03:45:45.454 --> 03:45:46.294]  Go ahead.
[03:45:46.294 --> 03:45:47.135]  Oh, you're the government.
[03:45:47.135 --> 03:45:47.635]  Okay.
[03:45:47.635 --> 03:45:48.776]  I'll give you my baby.
[03:45:49.534 --> 03:45:51.256]  Over my dead body, folks!
[03:45:51.256 --> 03:45:52.877]  So, hail the Mexicans!
[03:45:52.877 --> 03:45:54.058]  Hail their family!
[03:45:54.058 --> 03:45:55.379]  Hail their Raza!
[03:45:55.379 --> 03:46:03.105]  I have nothing against them caring about their people, and being proud of who they are, and wanting to have their families, and wanting to have children, and wanting to live.
[03:46:03.105 --> 03:46:05.087]  But don't you tell me I gotta die!
[03:46:05.087 --> 03:46:07.449]  Don't you tell me to get out of the way for you!
[03:46:07.449 --> 03:46:09.510]  Cause you're gonna get a fight!
[03:46:09.510 --> 03:46:11.072]  You're gonna get one, believe me!
[03:46:11.072 --> 03:46:13.514]  And you're gonna get a serious one!
[03:46:13.514 --> 03:46:16.536]  And I, you know, the New World Order's your enemy, whether you figured it out or not.
[03:46:16.536 --> 03:46:17.497]  It's not me, the gringo.
[03:46:19.736 --> 03:46:22.278]  Do gringos predominate the global hierarchy?
[03:46:22.278 --> 03:46:23.859]  Yes.
[03:46:23.859 --> 03:46:26.921]  But if you had... Latin Americans would have gotten all the power.
[03:46:26.921 --> 03:46:28.342]  It'd be the same thing.
[03:46:28.342 --> 03:46:30.184]  It's the way humans operate.
[03:46:30.184 --> 03:46:33.967]  But the big gringos have got you convinced the little gringos are your problem.
[03:46:33.967 --> 03:46:38.190]  When the real elite, and I've got their own documents, they don't like the little gringos.
[03:46:38.190 --> 03:46:40.852]  They are most worried about the little gringos.
[03:46:40.852 --> 03:46:42.333]  Okay, you understand that?
[03:46:42.333 --> 03:46:49.158]  And you're being used to bring down the middle class, whether it is a Mexican, Chinese, it doesn't matter.
[03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:50.230]  White.
[03:46:50.230 --> 03:46:51.952]  Black.
[03:46:51.952 --> 03:46:52.832]  Ugh.
[03:46:52.832 --> 03:46:53.953]  It's divide and conquer.
[03:46:53.953 --> 03:46:56.656]  It's called The Great Game by the British Empire.
[03:46:56.656 --> 03:46:58.337]  Google The Great Game.
[03:46:58.337 --> 03:46:59.378]  Art of Statescraft.
[03:46:59.378 --> 03:47:06.643]  Learn how you're manipulated.
[03:47:06.643 --> 03:47:09.586]  Let's go ahead and play this Grand Theft Auto clip.
[03:47:09.586 --> 03:47:13.889]  This is a piece where they joke around with it, basically.
[03:47:13.889 --> 03:47:15.791]  Where they've taken video from it and re-edited it.
[03:47:15.791 --> 03:47:16.231]  Here it goes.
[03:47:20.162 --> 03:47:21.243]  It's a noisy laptop.
[03:47:21.243 --> 03:47:21.963]  We're gonna fix it.
[03:47:21.963 --> 03:47:23.764]  My name is Brian O'Toole.
[03:47:23.764 --> 03:47:27.006]  I wanted to fight the war on terror, but I don't read so good.
[03:47:27.006 --> 03:47:28.667]  Most careers were closed to me.
[03:47:28.667 --> 03:47:31.248]  That's why I joined the LCPD.
[03:47:31.248 --> 03:47:35.690]  Now I'm on the front lines, helping tourists and fighting terrorists.
[03:47:35.690 --> 03:47:38.772]  I rifle through people's bags on the subway to protect freedom.
[03:47:38.772 --> 03:47:43.154]  I arrest protesters at political conventions for straying outside the free speech zone.
[03:47:43.154 --> 03:47:45.396]  Being a cop used to be about stopping crime.
[03:47:45.396 --> 03:47:49.398]  Now, thanks to politicians, it's about fighting terrorists, one old lady at a time.
[03:47:50.258 --> 03:47:52.861]  I'm protecting freedom, whatever the cost.
[03:47:52.861 --> 03:48:02.212]  I'm a hero, and I know it.
[03:48:02.212 --> 03:48:04.354]  Man, they have got it in this 45 second thing.
[03:48:04.354 --> 03:48:05.135]  I'm gonna play it again.
[03:48:05.135 --> 03:48:05.776]  It's just too good.
[03:48:05.776 --> 03:48:07.838]  I'm gonna play it again for you.
[03:48:11.650 --> 03:48:13.471]  My name is Brian O'Toole.
[03:48:13.471 --> 03:48:16.693]  I wanted to fight the war on terror, but I don't read so good.
[03:48:16.693 --> 03:48:18.354]  Most careers were closed to me.
[03:48:18.354 --> 03:48:20.935]  That's why I joined the LCPD.
[03:48:20.935 --> 03:48:25.377]  Now I'm on the front lines, helping tourists and fighting terrorists.
[03:48:25.377 --> 03:48:28.459]  I rifle through people's bags on the subway to protect freedom.
[03:48:28.459 --> 03:48:32.841]  I arrest protesters at political conventions for straying outside the free speech zone.
[03:48:32.841 --> 03:48:35.103]  Being a cop used to be about stopping crime.
[03:48:35.103 --> 03:48:39.085]  Now, thanks to politicians, it's about fighting terrorists, one old lady at a time.
[03:48:39.945 --> 03:48:42.548]  I'm protecting freedom, whatever the cost.
[03:48:42.548 --> 03:48:46.953]  I'm a hero, and I know it.
[03:48:46.953 --> 03:48:48.635]  Man, they really got the mindset.
[03:48:48.635 --> 03:48:50.597]  See how dumb that cop looks on this?
[03:48:50.597 --> 03:48:51.678]  Just totally dumb.
[03:48:51.678 --> 03:48:54.201]  Dumb as a box of rocks, man.
[03:48:54.201 --> 03:48:58.245]  I'm sorry, they're giving retards badges and guns now, and I've had enough of it.
[03:48:58.911 --> 03:49:00.472]  I mean, I look in some of these guys' eyes.
[03:49:00.472 --> 03:49:05.817]  I mean, when I was a kid growing up, you'd see cops who were always kind of shifty and sneaky looking, but you could tell they were smart.
[03:49:05.817 --> 03:49:13.403]  And now, you look at them, and it's like, and I'm not trying to be mean here.
[03:49:13.403 --> 03:49:25.913]  I mean, let them go, you know, clean the pigeon traps at the local park, or clean the pools out, or, you know, let them, you know, put a helmet on them, and let them, you know, run around.
[03:49:25.913 --> 03:49:26.413]  I'm sorry.
[03:49:27.253 --> 03:49:28.514]  Man, I apologize, folks.
[03:49:28.514 --> 03:49:30.395]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[03:49:30.395 --> 03:49:40.580]  The image of that cop swaying back and forth, whoever did that, got the exact... I mean, I have looked at them do that, because they do like this little meerkat dance of power when they're doing something bad.
[03:49:40.580 --> 03:49:42.841]  They go, boo, boo.
[03:49:42.841 --> 03:49:45.082]  They always do that.
[03:49:45.082 --> 03:49:45.923]  I don't know.
[03:49:45.923 --> 03:49:47.944]  Man, this is incredible.
[03:49:47.944 --> 03:49:48.704]  Watch it.
[03:49:48.704 --> 03:49:49.085]  Watch it.
[03:49:49.085 --> 03:49:50.025]  Here it is.
[03:49:50.025 --> 03:49:50.986]  I can't help it.
[03:49:50.986 --> 03:49:53.327]  I mean, this is exactly what it looks like right here.
[03:49:53.327 --> 03:49:55.348]  The guy right at the end, I'm going to pause it on him.
[03:49:56.309 --> 03:49:57.312]  And that's who we're going to worship.
[03:49:57.312 --> 03:49:58.655]  That's going to be our new God.
[03:49:58.655 --> 03:49:59.317]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:49:59.317 --> 03:50:00.560]  I had the audio down.
[03:50:00.560 --> 03:50:01.783]  Let's just restart it here.
[03:50:02.321 --> 03:50:03.962]  Most careers were closed to me.
[03:50:03.962 --> 03:50:06.223]  That's why I joined the L.C.P.D.
[03:50:06.223 --> 03:50:11.005]  Now I'm on the front lines, helping tourists and fighting terrorists.
[03:50:11.005 --> 03:50:13.727]  I rifle through people's bags on the subway to protect freedom.
[03:50:13.727 --> 03:50:18.449]  I arrest protesters at political conventions for straying outside the free speech zone.
[03:50:18.449 --> 03:50:20.730]  Being a cop used to be about stopping crime.
[03:50:20.730 --> 03:50:25.592]  Now, thanks to politicians, it's about fighting terrorists, one old lady at a time.
[03:50:25.592 --> 03:50:28.174]  I'm protecting freedom, whatever the cost.
[03:50:28.174 --> 03:50:29.194]  I'm a hero.
[03:50:29.194 --> 03:50:30.815]  Ha ha ha, there he is right there.
[03:50:31.906 --> 03:50:32.767]  That's him, dude.
[03:50:32.767 --> 03:50:34.528]  That is the Mack leader.
[03:50:34.528 --> 03:50:35.769]  Dave in New York and others.
[03:50:35.769 --> 03:50:38.250]  Final segment straight ahead in the zone.
[03:50:38.250 --> 03:50:45.915]  I'll be showing my new film, Truth Rising, coming up this Saturday and Sunday, Alamo Draft House.
[03:50:45.915 --> 03:50:47.216]  It is a big idea.
[03:50:48.382 --> 03:50:50.144]  A New World Order.
[03:50:50.144 --> 03:50:55.048]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:50:55.048 --> 03:50:57.870]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:50:57.870 --> 03:51:00.653]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:51:00.653 --> 03:51:03.856]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:51:03.856 --> 03:51:11.162]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:51:14.185 --> 03:51:19.630]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:51:19.630 --> 03:51:22.954]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:51:22.954 --> 03:51:26.077]  The overburden is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:51:26.077 --> 03:51:27.238]  Most people have no idea.
[03:51:27.238 --> 03:51:28.039]  They're not after money.
[03:51:28.039 --> 03:51:29.300]  They have all the money they need.
[03:51:29.300 --> 03:51:30.301]  They're after power.
[03:51:30.301 --> 03:51:31.442]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:51:31.442 --> 03:51:35.627]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[03:51:44.909 --> 03:51:46.510]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[03:51:46.510 --> 03:51:50.191]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[03:51:50.191 --> 03:51:56.232]  This confederation of Evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[03:51:56.232 --> 03:52:00.293]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[03:52:00.293 --> 03:52:03.694]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom.
[03:52:03.894 --> 03:52:05.055]  Liberty of conscience.
[03:52:05.055 --> 03:52:09.720]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[03:52:09.720 --> 03:52:13.783]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[03:52:13.783 --> 03:52:16.386]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[03:52:16.386 --> 03:52:21.691]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[03:52:21.691 --> 03:52:25.354]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[03:52:25.354 --> 03:52:27.937]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[03:52:28.137 --> 03:52:30.898]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[03:52:30.898 --> 03:52:32.819]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling!
[03:52:32.819 --> 03:52:34.420]  Jesus is coming soon!

[03:52:44.392 --> 03:52:50.396]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[03:52:50.396 --> 03:53:01.845]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[03:53:02.265 --> 03:53:03.426]  Here's the story.
[03:53:03.426 --> 03:53:11.572]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[03:53:11.572 --> 03:53:12.733]  And here's the best part.
[03:53:12.733 --> 03:53:14.415]  It's 100% legal.
[03:53:14.415 --> 03:53:20.859]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[03:53:20.859 --> 03:53:25.143]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[03:53:25.663 --> 03:53:29.984]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[03:53:29.984 --> 03:53:31.105]  It's that simple.
[03:53:31.105 --> 03:53:34.726]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[03:53:34.726 --> 03:53:38.026]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[03:53:38.026 --> 03:53:43.628]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[03:54:02.602 --> 03:54:12.570]  That's why you Genesis wanna kill you Take a shot, take a shot Go ahead and get sterilized Cause the government loves you
[03:54:15.595 --> 03:54:17.196]  I got this AB Club newspaper.
[03:54:17.196 --> 03:54:20.336]  It's about Chris Carter, creator of the X-Files.
[03:54:20.336 --> 03:54:23.577]  He's making a new X-Files movie.
[03:54:23.577 --> 03:54:25.918]  And I was reading this this morning.
[03:54:43.629 --> 03:54:44.649]  And I meant to get to it today.
[03:54:44.649 --> 03:54:47.510]  I'm going to leave it on my desk and try to cover it tomorrow.
[03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:51.191]  But he just said, oh, you thought the old X-Files thought the government was bad behind everything.
[03:54:51.191 --> 03:54:53.531]  He goes, I really now believe that.
[03:54:53.531 --> 03:54:55.151]  And basically, our country's gone.
[03:54:55.151 --> 03:54:58.592]  And so my new film says the government's pure evil.
[03:54:58.592 --> 03:55:04.253]  And then that is, we just found out on their website, that is a Grand Theft Auto trailer.
[03:55:04.253 --> 03:55:05.934]  And what's the tagline?
[03:55:05.934 --> 03:55:07.374]  The American dream, wake up.
[03:55:08.508 --> 03:55:12.429]  And, uh, my gosh, and Chris Carter says everybody's woken up to the government.
[03:55:12.429 --> 03:55:15.049]  I think you guys went too far, like with Ceausescu.
[03:55:15.049 --> 03:55:21.730]  So go ahead, hire some more SWAT teams, waddle around, have Halliburton move to Dubai and run public white slave rings.
[03:55:21.730 --> 03:55:23.491]  It's over.
[03:55:23.491 --> 03:55:27.552]  And for the good cops and good people in government, I suggest you join us quickly.
[03:55:27.552 --> 03:55:35.033]  Because when Grand Theft Auto, and it doesn't get any more pop culture than that, when Grand Theft Auto wakes up, uh, the New World Order,
[03:55:35.620 --> 03:55:38.581]  Has got a serious, serious problem.
[03:55:38.581 --> 03:55:40.542]  That's a nice young lady right there.
[03:55:40.542 --> 03:55:41.642]  Sure she's very good.
[03:55:41.642 --> 03:55:47.084]  Probably a college student working hard.
[03:55:47.084 --> 03:55:50.405]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[03:55:50.405 --> 03:55:52.686]  Oh, never mind.
[03:55:52.686 --> 03:55:54.767]  The game Grand Theft Auto has prostitutes in it.
[03:55:54.767 --> 03:55:56.747]  That's the joke.
[03:55:56.747 --> 03:55:57.308]  I believe that.
[03:55:57.308 --> 03:55:57.868]  I've never played it.
[03:55:57.868 --> 03:55:58.928]  Isn't that the case with Burmese?
[03:55:58.928 --> 03:56:00.889]  Yeah, Burmese is an expert on everything like that.
[03:56:01.782 --> 03:56:04.123]  Alright, I'm going to knock it off.
[03:56:04.123 --> 03:56:06.784]  This is not a comedy show and I know I'm not funny.
[03:56:06.784 --> 03:56:09.085]  Dave in New York, go ahead.
[03:56:09.085 --> 03:56:10.325]  How you doing Alex?
[03:56:10.325 --> 03:56:11.545]  Good sir, what's on your mind?
[03:56:11.545 --> 03:56:19.368]  I'll try to be as quick as possible since I know it's almost 4 o'clock, but I just want to thank you for informing me 7 years ago.
[03:56:19.368 --> 03:56:27.050]  But one thing, I don't actually know, but it does sicken me that I think the government is behind AIDS since you're actually talking about bioweapons.
[03:56:27.050 --> 03:56:28.751]  Oh there's no doubt they're behind it, it's a fact sir.
[03:56:29.358 --> 03:56:33.040]  So, uh, I know I was actually reading and looking at the flowchart online.
[03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:37.944]  I'm just also wondering, have you ever had, uh, Dr. Boydy Graves on your show?
[03:56:37.944 --> 03:56:39.465]  Yes, I have.
[03:56:39.465 --> 03:56:43.087]  Uh, would it be possible, maybe, for you to actually get him up again?
[03:56:43.087 --> 03:56:46.329]  Because I definitely would like to hear you question him and figure it out.
[03:56:46.329 --> 03:56:50.752]  Because I actually questioned everything, but the minute I saw the flowchart, it kind of opened my mind.
[03:56:50.752 --> 03:56:55.555]  Because, like you said, it's kind of hard to even sink that in, and it's sickened me since.
[03:56:55.555 --> 03:56:58.077]  A lot of people's friends, family have died because of it.
[03:56:58.522 --> 03:57:01.324]  So since you're on the topic of bioweapons, that's right.
[03:57:01.324 --> 03:57:01.884]  No, I hear it.
[03:57:01.884 --> 03:57:02.985]  It's a saddening topic.
[03:57:02.985 --> 03:57:06.808]  I shouldn't be joking around while you're even talking about it.
[03:57:06.808 --> 03:57:09.710]  It's terrible, and we're going to have more guests on about that.
[03:57:09.710 --> 03:57:11.531]  We've been having guests on about it.
[03:57:11.531 --> 03:57:14.633]  Endgame 2, I don't know if I'm going to call it Endgame 2.
[03:57:14.633 --> 03:57:17.295]  I might call it 2012 something.
[03:57:17.295 --> 03:57:21.198]  But that certainly is something we're working on, sir.
[03:57:21.198 --> 03:57:25.220]  You talked recently about bioweapons, and most of your audience is informed.
[03:57:25.220 --> 03:57:27.562]  So to those that are listening in that don't know,
[03:57:28.126 --> 03:57:32.569]  You know, that way you can open up their mind and also have other people that have no idea about it.
[03:57:32.569 --> 03:57:34.831]  Because I think that's something that should really be talked about more.
[03:57:34.831 --> 03:57:35.371]  I hear you.
[03:57:35.371 --> 03:57:36.392]  We're out of time, David.
[03:57:36.392 --> 03:57:36.752]  Thank you.
[03:57:36.752 --> 03:57:40.615]  I'll be back tomorrow live, 11 to 3, Central Standard Time.
[03:57:40.615 --> 03:57:44.277]  And I will be back in one minute with the start of the first hour.
[03:57:44.277 --> 03:57:46.279]  A lot of key news and info got covered.
[03:57:46.279 --> 03:57:55.025]  If you missed any of it, if you just tuned in, the start of the show from four hours ago is about to re-air at InfoWars.com on those audio streams.
[03:57:56.423 --> 03:58:01.168]  A lot of key stuff that I covered right at the start of the show, so I hope you'll tune in to that right now.
[03:58:01.168 --> 03:58:03.991]  For all the MNFM stations out there, we appreciate you.
[03:58:03.991 --> 03:58:10.158]  All the sponsors, the listeners, the folks running the show here in Austin, John Harmon in Minnesota.
[03:58:10.158 --> 03:58:14.363]  Big guest coming up next week, Alamo Draft House, Saturday and Sunday.
[03:58:14.363 --> 03:58:17.546]  Get your tickets now, they're almost sold out, at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:17.546 --> 03:58:18.227]  God bless you all.
[03:58:27.728 --> 03:58:30.229]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:35.651]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:35.651 --> 03:58:37.611]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:58:37.611 --> 03:58:41.233]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:58:41.233 --> 03:58:43.694]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:58:43.694 --> 03:58:46.735]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
