[00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:14.662]  For the next 52 minutes, we're joined by documentary filmmaker, musician, good friend of mine, Kevin Booth, also Bill Hicks' producer.
[00:00:16.018 --> 00:00:24.040]  His program, of course, American Drug War, has aired, I don't know how many times, forty times or something, last time I heard, on Showtime.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.340]  It's getting ready to air again.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.200]  Very, very popular.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.120]  Created a huge buzz.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.301]  We happen to have the DVD available at Infowars.com.
[00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:39.683]  Two-hour film and three hours of extras for $19.95 and you fund the filmmaking work of Kevin Booth.
[00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:44.604]  But he's here because we've got the election coming up and there's different initiatives around the country to try to decriminalize
[00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:51.599]  Some of the drugs the government uses to get involved in our lives that they tend to ship in as well.
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.663]  And we also have an expert joining us later in the interview, friends with Kevin.
[00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:04.850]  We've got the founder and executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a New York City based non-profit organization working to end the war on drugs.
[00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:07.993]  He's considered one of the most outspoken advocates of drug legalization.
[00:01:08.253 --> 00:01:10.915]  Kevin, I appreciate you sub-setting him up for the show today.
[00:01:11.416 --> 00:01:13.858]  When is he scheduled to join us on the transmission?
[00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:21.740]  As soon as he gets out, he's on an Amtrak heading for his office right now, so as soon as he can get off of the train, so it'll be in the end of the hour.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.141]  Did you give him the studio backline?
[00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:24.741]  Yes.
[00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:26.481]  Okay, good.
[00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:33.303]  Tell us, well, I mean, number one, let's get into some of the initiatives that are going on right now.
[00:01:34.684 --> 00:01:43.106]  Well, this is Proposition 5 here in California, and it's basically just, it's
[00:01:44.710 --> 00:02:12.366]  Put it this way, the drugs are, the prisons, the massive prison guard unions, which I don't even cover in my film, which are very powerful out here, are working hard to stop this thing because what they try to do, which they've been very successful with in my film covers, is they make one single category out of non-violent drug offenders and rapists and murderers and they try to make it
[00:02:12.987 --> 00:02:19.621]  So if you get caught growing a pot plant that you're gonna go and sit in jail with some guy who murdered and raped everybody.
[00:02:20.282 --> 00:02:25.026]  Well, that's because, what, eighty-something percent of drug users only smoke marijuana.
[00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:25.946]  Illegal drug users.
[00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:27.648]  And it's modern slavery.
[00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:29.169]  Governments have always wanted slavery.
[00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.932]  You've got the private banks that launder the money that own the private prisons.
[00:02:33.512 --> 00:02:40.097]  And then that devalues the base of wages that people are paid.
[00:02:40.137 --> 00:02:44.460]  We're competing against the millions of people working in the growing prison industries.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.101]  And so they don't want it to go away.
[00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:47.523]  They want the easy-to-control
[00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.184]  Little weed heads.
[00:02:50.264 --> 00:02:51.345]  They're in their slave pit.
[00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.946]  Yeah, and it's a way to keep the numbers up.
[00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:57.348]  It's all a numbers game.
[00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:03.451]  If they take all the pot smokers out of this equation, they're going to lose a ton of business.
[00:03:03.631 --> 00:03:06.152]  So they have to flush all these things together.
[00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:08.193]  But it's not even just who they arrest.
[00:03:08.373 --> 00:03:12.415]  Also, a lot of it has to do with how many years you get.
[00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:17.158]  The sentencing guidelines are big on it, too, whether you get six months or six years.
[00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:21.157]  It also has a lot to do with how much profit the prison and the guards are going to make.
[00:03:21.277 --> 00:03:24.179]  Yeah, it was pretty shameful a few months ago when I had Ted Nugent on.
[00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.561]  He was like, throw all the potheads in prison.
[00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.441]  They're lazy!
[00:03:29.163 --> 00:03:29.823]  Yeah, that'll work.
[00:03:30.224 --> 00:03:33.466]  That's a really good system.
[00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:35.348]  I mean, what a corrupt, stinking government.
[00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:40.051]  They're pushing Ritalin, Prozac, hundreds of other deadly drugs on the kids in school.
[00:03:40.672 --> 00:03:43.053]  Half the public is completely drunken on Prozac.
[00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:46.196]  But meanwhile, let's put everybody in jail who smokes marijuana.
[00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:51.387]  No, it's absolutely sane, and giving them longer sentences in some cases.
[00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:56.769]  I mean, people get longer sentences for growing pot in some cases than rape or murder.
[00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.730]  Well, every week I read about a SWAT team gunning people down in their house who had pot plants.
[00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.491]  I mean, what's the greater threat?
[00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:07.093]  Some weedheads or men stomping around knocking down doors at 4 a.m.?
[00:04:07.853 --> 00:04:09.994]  Yeah, no, it's terrible.
[00:04:10.014 --> 00:04:15.076]  So, I mean, Prop 5 is... I'll have Ethan on in a little while to explain the specifics of it.
[00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:21.466]  My understanding is that it's trying to shift from incarceration over to rehabilitation.
[00:04:21.486 --> 00:04:27.511]  Supposed to save the taxpayers of California approximately two and a half billion dollars per year.
[00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:35.677]  Yeah, but then the undercover cops can't drive around in brand new Chargers and Porsches and act cool.
[00:04:35.757 --> 00:04:36.257]  I mean, you know.
[00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:37.958]  Yeah, and they have to get down.
[00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:39.259]  You know, remember here in L.A.
[00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:44.023]  they had that, oh God, I forgot what they called it, that battering ram thing that they put on the front of this tank?
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.901]  Well, yeah, I mean, these are guys that are too scared to go join the military.
[00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.082]  They like picking on potheads.
[00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.382]  I mean, they gotta act tough, man.
[00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:52.063]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:04:52.183 --> 00:04:57.204]  I mean, but it's just a way to get those numbers up, keep those prisons full.
[00:04:58.225 --> 00:05:01.866]  It's funny, I even got my first angry email.
[00:05:01.886 --> 00:05:06.488]  You know, in my film I talk about the city of Taft, because that's where Tommy Chong was, the prison there.
[00:05:07.188 --> 00:05:11.790]  I got my first email from a guy in Taft saying, like, Taft still has oil.
[00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:14.732]  You know, we're not relying on the prison system.
[00:05:15.092 --> 00:05:16.213]  We're a great town.
[00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:18.254]  You know, I got all defensive for this town.
[00:05:18.274 --> 00:05:22.236]  Well, that's like Thule, where the only business was the prison.
[00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:27.618]  Literally, like the old days, when they just rounded the blacks up and threw them in the slave pit.
[00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:29.879]  Well, that's the problem, Kevin.
[00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.542]  I mean, we've got the vast majority of the public in every poll saying decriminalize marijuana, at least.
[00:05:35.496 --> 00:05:39.737]  And all these states are trying to decriminalize it, but the feds rove around attacking people.
[00:05:40.377 --> 00:05:45.958]  I mean, I don't see how they're going to get away with this drug war forever, so now they're trying to tie marijuana in with terrorism.
[00:05:46.738 --> 00:05:58.901]  Yeah, that was like one of the things that Bush did, you know, right around the creation of the Patriot Act, and coming out with that campaign that's in my film, the Nick and Norm campaign, where if you buy marijuana, you support terrorism.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.041]  I think it's true, because it is true.
[00:06:06.661 --> 00:06:09.582]  The guys at the dinner table going, oh, it's just because I smoke a little weed.
[00:06:09.862 --> 00:06:28.105]  What's funny about it is that I actually got the copy of that film, because I think the guy that plays Nick is actually a struggling actor out here in L.A., and some guy from an editing studio had his actor reel, and we were like, look at this actor's acting reel, and he was like Nick from Nick and Norm, and like fell over, dying laughing.
[00:06:30.607 --> 00:06:31.208]  Oh, whatever.
[00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.691]  Let's just have a moment of silence here.
[00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:42.397]  Kevin, so much is going on.
[00:06:42.857 --> 00:06:54.847]  Tell the story about how you're flying around the country on the speaker's circuit, all these universities, institutions, people want to hear from you, with your award-winning film, and how they're trying to stop you from coming to the universities.
[00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.872]  Well, first of all, I want to say the biggest conspiracy right now are the people making money off bottled water.
[00:07:01.272 --> 00:07:15.059]  If you travel as much as I do, the biggest scam going at the airport right now is, uh, give us your bottle of water on this side of this thing, and then you cross through this thing, and then you go, here, you can buy another bottle of water from us, and then they throw all these bottles of water in this giant thing, and they probably
[00:07:15.683 --> 00:07:18.525]  Move them around back and re-consolidate them and sell them to you.
[00:07:18.545 --> 00:07:21.908]  I swear, I was like, what are you going to do with all that water?
[00:07:21.928 --> 00:07:23.769]  Are you going to give it to prisoners or something?
[00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:24.730]  Or give it to Doc?
[00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.172]  What do you guys do with all your bottled water?
[00:07:28.252 --> 00:07:34.337]  But I mean, tell the story about... Oh yeah, so I was going to a university in Florida.
[00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:36.558]  Where was this?
[00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:37.619]  Fort Myers.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.924]  And somebody there on the faculty, some woman on the faculty started passing around an email to everybody
[00:07:44.454 --> 00:07:55.042]  Telling them that she was very upset that they were bringing me in as a speaker and that the young students didn't need to be exposed to something this controversial right before an election.
[00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:58.104]  And then tell them the ultimate piece of evidence of your evil.
[00:07:58.484 --> 00:08:03.388]  She said, I discovered that Mr. Booth had worked on Ninja Bachelor Party.
[00:08:03.408 --> 00:08:06.731]  Which is non-sexual.
[00:08:12.293 --> 00:08:16.517]  It's you and Bill Hicks acting stupid, you know, acting like you're going to ninja school.
[00:08:16.857 --> 00:08:20.280]  Ninja bachelor parties is like, that's my own Bill Ayers moment, right?
[00:08:23.642 --> 00:08:25.844]  Ah, not once, not twice, well, twice!
[00:08:26.725 --> 00:08:27.606]  Well, at least twice.
[00:08:27.646 --> 00:08:28.286]  Twice, I mean it.
[00:08:28.526 --> 00:08:29.527]  Look at my resume, twice.
[00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:31.949]  I was drinking the Robitussin.
[00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:35.772]  Oh, Dr. Death, that's me.
[00:08:35.792 --> 00:08:39.515]  Honey, I'm disappointed in ya.
[00:08:39.696 --> 00:08:41.237]  We always end up talking about this, don't we?
[00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:42.922]  I'll tell you a funny story.
[00:08:43.783 --> 00:08:45.204]  So I go to these lecture rooms.
[00:08:45.264 --> 00:08:47.345]  I'm in upstate New York about a week ago.
[00:08:47.425 --> 00:08:48.146]  Freezing cold.
[00:08:48.506 --> 00:08:49.126]  Oswego.
[00:08:49.807 --> 00:08:51.148]  So many of the kids are apathetic.
[00:08:51.168 --> 00:08:53.629]  That's the scary thing is how apathetic so many kids are.
[00:08:53.689 --> 00:08:55.310]  Well, they're TV heads.
[00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.671]  So I do this one classroom.
[00:08:56.691 --> 00:08:58.032]  It's a really cool teacher.
[00:08:58.052 --> 00:08:59.613]  He has me to a second classroom.
[00:08:59.653 --> 00:09:00.454]  Big lecture hall.
[00:09:01.495 --> 00:09:07.259]  I do this little 15 minute set that's like a multimedia presentation with a monologue and then the Q&A.
[00:09:08.123 --> 00:09:11.084]  You get to this section where I'm like, you know, how many kids smoke pot?
[00:09:11.104 --> 00:09:14.265]  You know, half the room, you know, raises their hands.
[00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:15.766]  You know, how many people are stoned right now?
[00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:16.946]  Everybody's laughing and joking.
[00:09:17.406 --> 00:09:23.308]  So out of the corner of my eye, there's this one other guy, a young black guy dressed in a pinstripe suit.
[00:09:23.488 --> 00:09:24.709]  Doesn't really look like he fits.
[00:09:25.369 --> 00:09:27.389]  So I get up and leave, and he's the next speaker.
[00:09:27.429 --> 00:09:28.390]  He comes up out after me.
[00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.250]  It turns out he was a narcotics officer.
[00:09:31.251 --> 00:09:31.751]  And so...
[00:09:32.304 --> 00:09:39.269]  The kids come to my show later and they thought that I had set them up because I'm like the cool guy that gets up there and I'm like, how many people in the audience do drugs?
[00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:40.430]  Everybody raise your hands!
[00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.931]  Woo!
[00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:43.593]  Alright, up next, Officer Johnson.
[00:09:44.713 --> 00:09:47.315]  Yeah, and those guys are totally sold into their system.
[00:09:47.355 --> 00:09:49.037]  It's their career, so they've got to defend it.
[00:09:51.499 --> 00:09:54.280]  And they'll argue, well look at all these unsavory types that are involved with drugs.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.720]  Yeah, because you make it illegal.
[00:09:56.141 --> 00:09:59.262]  Now you've just given the criminal element something to make a lot of money off of.
[00:09:59.542 --> 00:10:00.462]  But they've got a problem.
[00:10:00.482 --> 00:10:08.305]  There are these bigger and bigger organizations forming, filled with former narcotics officers and others, that go in public saying it's all complete bull.
[00:10:08.805 --> 00:10:09.445]  Yeah, LEAP.
[00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:12.406]  That's what I tell everybody always.
[00:10:13.266 --> 00:10:13.907]  Google LEAP.
[00:10:14.067 --> 00:10:15.567]  Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[00:10:15.587 --> 00:10:18.768]  That's a really hard one to argue.
[00:10:18.828 --> 00:10:19.669]  And just one other thing.
[00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:27.192]  Almost 85% of all kids smoke pot, whether they're good or bad or rebellious or whether they tell you they are or aren't.
[00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:31.636]  Kids are most likely, your children are most likely going to try smoking pot.
[00:10:31.656 --> 00:10:33.257]  Now here's a question you've got to ask yourself.
[00:10:34.138 --> 00:10:39.903]  When they're going to go, do you want them to buy that pot from some regulated, safe source?
[00:10:40.143 --> 00:10:43.446]  Or do you want them to get it from a guy that sells crystal meth and crack cocaine?
[00:10:43.486 --> 00:10:44.507]  Well that goes back to...
[00:10:46.124 --> 00:10:49.145]  Alcohol poisoning just went way up.
[00:10:49.225 --> 00:10:51.546]  Some estimates three times, most estimates five times.
[00:10:52.206 --> 00:10:54.906]  Alcoholism tripled during Prohibition.
[00:10:55.327 --> 00:10:56.987]  And it was bad alcohol.
[00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:58.868]  And it's the same thing.
[00:10:58.928 --> 00:11:00.048]  I mean, I smoked some pot.
[00:11:00.168 --> 00:11:04.229]  I never really liked it because, you know, I get quote paranoid when I smoke it.
[00:11:04.249 --> 00:11:09.430]  I'm not going to make a joke about Sunday.
[00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:10.591]  But anyways.
[00:11:12.153 --> 00:11:19.778]  But, you know, the whole point here is, is that, the whole point here is, clearly marijuana is far less bad for you than alcohol.
[00:11:19.818 --> 00:11:21.239]  And, Kevin, you have those statistics.
[00:11:21.259 --> 00:11:25.942]  Let's go over some of the government's own statistics about what prescription drugs, alcohol.
[00:11:26.542 --> 00:11:29.064]  I mean, these are killing 400, 500 thousand a year.
[00:11:29.224 --> 00:11:30.145]  Combine the two numbers.
[00:11:30.825 --> 00:11:32.266]  One's 200 thousand, another's about 300 thousand.
[00:11:32.286 --> 00:11:34.748]  It changes year to year, but sometimes it's higher, sometimes it's lower.
[00:11:35.448 --> 00:11:37.570]  And then marijuana, they can't find deaths from it.
[00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.492]  I mean, you just can't find the deaths from it.
[00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:42.915]  So it's an excuse to get in our lives.
[00:11:43.015 --> 00:11:43.635]  It's an excuse.
[00:11:43.655 --> 00:11:44.916]  They know the kids are using it.
[00:11:44.936 --> 00:11:45.737]  That's why it's illegal.
[00:11:46.397 --> 00:11:48.718]  Let me talk to Booth.
[00:11:49.219 --> 00:11:50.399]  Skip the break.
[00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:51.860]  Still going, right?
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.361]  Hey John, I want to talk to Booth.
[00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:57.023]  We're on the internet right now, but it's not the full audience.
[00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:58.204]  But I want to be specific.
[00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:01.706]  I've heard of this Ethan Nadelman's way you pronounce it?
[00:12:01.986 --> 00:12:02.206]  Yeah.
[00:12:04.067 --> 00:12:05.168]  Well this is really interesting.
[00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:07.650]  I should have him on just as a guest separately sometime.
[00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.910]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.971]  I wanted to bring him on earlier.
[00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:11.043]  I've tried.
[00:12:11.204 --> 00:12:11.604]  I've tried.
[00:12:11.944 --> 00:12:14.206]  But no, he'll come on as a guest, I believe, for sure.
[00:12:14.746 --> 00:12:21.892]  What is the system going to do when, like, 98% of the public has smoked marijuana at one time or not in their life, but they're still putting everybody in jail for it?
[00:12:22.853 --> 00:12:23.293]  I don't know.
[00:12:23.434 --> 00:12:24.675]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[00:12:25.275 --> 00:12:34.603]  I think they're getting ready to have the 20 million man march somewhere, or something like that, that's going to mark the 20 millionth marijuana arrest or something taking place in March.
[00:12:35.353 --> 00:12:39.098]  Well, my mom remembers going to the University of Texas back in the mid-60s.
[00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:42.402]  If they caught you with marijuana, it was like 50 years in prison.
[00:12:43.203 --> 00:12:49.191]  I just got back from Tulsa, Oklahoma, where some guy met his best friend, got six years for like a half a bag.
[00:12:51.624 --> 00:13:12.802]  Meanwhile, it's really in the histories that they grew tons of not just hemp for rope and sails and cloth, but they grew the type of marijuana that actually has THC in it all over the colonies, they exported it all over the world, and that for stomachaches, all the same things it's medically used for today, that was one of the apothecaries that they gave to the barbers or the doctors.
[00:13:13.542 --> 00:13:14.003]  That's right.
[00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:37.887]  You know, online they've got copies of the old manuals where it talks about, you know, have them smoke the bud, you know, the sexual organ of the plant.
[00:13:38.207 --> 00:13:39.427]  That has the better effect.
[00:13:39.888 --> 00:13:40.308]  Smoke it.
[00:13:40.548 --> 00:13:47.912]  And then you can read where, even when he was president, you see George Washington's doctors for toothaches saying, smoke this in your pipe.
[00:13:48.532 --> 00:13:49.713]  You know, inhale it.
[00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:52.524]  That's it, George Washington, jail time, over.
[00:13:52.764 --> 00:13:53.765]  Arrest him.
[00:13:53.985 --> 00:13:59.309]  Listen, you know, you basically, I guess you could say God left us with three categories.
[00:13:59.329 --> 00:14:03.872]  You've got cocaine, and then you've got the poppy opiates, and then you've got the THC drugs.
[00:14:03.932 --> 00:14:10.616]  Now, we should get the more powerful ones that can kill you, that can shut down your breathing, that can stop your heart.
[00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:12.611]  Those things are legal.
[00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:14.352]  You can get those through a prescription.
[00:14:14.392 --> 00:14:15.112]  Have been forever.
[00:14:15.373 --> 00:14:16.613]  You know, you get dental surgery.
[00:14:16.633 --> 00:14:17.874]  They give you liquid cocaine.
[00:14:17.894 --> 00:14:18.854]  You get your tonsils out.
[00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:19.714]  Liquid cocaine.
[00:14:19.754 --> 00:14:20.735]  Pharmaceutical grade.
[00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:23.236]  You know, opiate derivatives.
[00:14:23.256 --> 00:14:27.077]  That's everything from Vicodin to Tylenol-3 all the way to Oxycontin.
[00:14:27.677 --> 00:14:28.058]  All of that.
[00:14:28.178 --> 00:14:30.158]  The whole opium-based category.
[00:14:30.178 --> 00:14:31.299]  And then you move into the
[00:14:31.775 --> 00:14:38.199]  The cannabis thing, and they're like, oh, we got this Marinol pill, or it's like taking one would be like, you know, it's just nothing.
[00:14:38.239 --> 00:14:50.687]  Well, remember Rush Limbaugh over and over again said he would defend those cocaine laws against blacks, where if it was crack cocaine, you get 20 years, but if it was a lawyer with powdered cocaine, you get a month or whatever, or probation.
[00:14:51.308 --> 00:14:56.951]  And Limbaugh still defends that, even though he was caught taking 100 plus Oxycontins a day.
[00:14:56.971 --> 00:14:59.553]  And what's even more ridiculous about that law
[00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:02.792]  Is that powdered cocaine is four times stronger than crack.
[00:15:03.052 --> 00:15:04.693]  As far as like how much cocaine in it.
[00:15:04.753 --> 00:15:07.554]  Crack is actually like poor man's coke.
[00:15:07.594 --> 00:15:10.355]  You know, it's actually kind of like a rip-off really.
[00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:14.337]  They mix it with baking soda and it actually has very little cocaine in it.
[00:15:14.477 --> 00:15:19.059]  I know it's addictive but it's just, you know, but that's what makes it classic.
[00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:20.039]  It's actually weaker.
[00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:27.282]  Well, the CIA had the design, you know, the recipe on that and they put it out.
[00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:32.030]  They put it out on the street, so just problem, reaction, solution.
[00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:39.433]  The CIA got the recipe, though, from just hanging around in the streets of Bogota and stuff.
[00:15:39.453 --> 00:15:41.694]  Have you heard of this thing where they freebase marijuana?
[00:15:44.175 --> 00:15:44.696]  What's that called?
[00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:45.416]  A vaporizer?
[00:15:45.756 --> 00:15:47.617]  Yeah, that's not freebasing.
[00:15:47.637 --> 00:15:54.000]  Well, I mean, I know it's not freebasing cocaine, but I'm saying it's simply... But that's vaporizing a plant.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.340]  We're going back to the full audience.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:55.981]  I understand that.
[00:15:56.001 --> 00:15:56.261]  Here we go.
[00:16:00.063 --> 00:16:04.887]  Kevin Booth, the maker of American Drug War, available at Infowars.com, discounted in 1995.
[00:16:05.107 --> 00:16:07.649]  I hope you'll get it and show it to your friends, family, and neighbors.
[00:16:07.669 --> 00:16:14.034]  This will even wake up the most stubborn not-heads out there that still... I hear them call and talk radio all the time.
[00:16:14.415 --> 00:16:15.536]  Marijuana!
[00:16:15.596 --> 00:16:19.098]  We gotta put them in jail!
[00:16:19.158 --> 00:16:21.701]  But, give me more whiskey!
[00:16:23.147 --> 00:16:33.449]  Let's get into the numbers, and they vary year to year, but it's always massive, of what prescription drugs and alcohol kill and cigarettes kill versus the devilish Mary Jane.
[00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:40.371]  Well, the numbers in my film are that tobacco kills about 450,000 a year, half a million a year.
[00:16:41.031 --> 00:16:41.711]  Alcohol, about 150,000.
[00:16:41.791 --> 00:16:46.272]  That's just from health-related issues.
[00:16:47.332 --> 00:16:49.573]  A little under 100,000 from probably accidental.
[00:16:49.773 --> 00:16:50.493]  Yeah, more than that.
[00:16:52.572 --> 00:16:56.416]  Pharmaceutical drugs, legal pharmaceutical drugs, roughly $100,000 per year.
[00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.090]  No, no, I agree.
[00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.451]  I mean, I report in Endgame that governments only killed 200 million people last century.
[00:17:15.491 --> 00:17:16.931]  It's more like 300 million.
[00:17:16.951 --> 00:17:19.392]  I've been called out for that, but we're being conservative here, you know.
[00:17:19.512 --> 00:17:25.134]  Well, it's also true how we always say that the prison population is 2 million, and it seems like we've been saying that for some time.
[00:17:25.534 --> 00:17:28.334]  Yeah, it's really 4 million behind bars, about 3 million on probation.
[00:17:28.815 --> 00:17:30.175]  Yeah, that sounds more like it.
[00:17:30.195 --> 00:17:33.816]  You know, and then marijuana, basically,
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:40.221]  It is physically impossible for marijuana to shut down your heart or to stop your respiration.
[00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:44.142]  If somebody could physically, you couldn't smoke enough to OD.
[00:17:44.162 --> 00:17:51.583]  Suppose like you melted it down into some substance and you drank it down like cough syrup, 10 pounds of marijuana.
[00:17:52.303 --> 00:17:54.263]  The worst that would happen is you would fall asleep.
[00:17:54.943 --> 00:18:03.685]  You'd probably wake up and maybe like trip and crack your head on the refrigerator while you're trying to like... The worst you're going to do is raid 7-Eleven for Blue Bell Dutch Chocolate.
[00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:09.671]  Yep, for me it's like this.
[00:18:10.251 --> 00:18:15.552]  I go to Trader Joe's here, they've got this cherry chocolate, forget about it, I'm hooked.
[00:18:15.792 --> 00:18:18.553]  Hey, what's this vaporizer, where they're smoking weed now?
[00:18:18.813 --> 00:18:19.973]  That just heats it up.
[00:18:20.013 --> 00:18:26.294]  It's a way of, so it's not so much smoke, but vapor, and it's better for your lungs.
[00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:36.896]  It just puts it in this superheated chamber, and then a lot of these higher end vaporizers, what it does is it shoots the vapor into a plastic bag, and then you inhale the vapor from the plastic bag,
[00:18:37.532 --> 00:18:45.739]  I actually tried that in Amsterdam, and it's just very, very cool, because really, smoking anything is not good for you.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.763]  Yeah, it's hot, there's the tars, it parches your throat.
[00:18:49.783 --> 00:18:56.749]  That's why people use water pipes and all those types of things, it's all about trying to cool the smoke and not having this hot, burning thing.
[00:18:56.789 --> 00:19:01.674]  The ultra-weed heads now supposedly have those big vaporizers, but in a room, like a chamber.
[00:19:03.877 --> 00:19:08.220]  Yeah, I mean, you know, you can buy all kinds of stuff and it's big business, big business.
[00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:14.585]  I'll tell you what the big business right now is this fake urine, synthetic urine.
[00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:19.870]  And there's things called the Wizenator, you ever seen a Wizenator?
[00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.552]  And that's to get around the drug test, right?
[00:19:24.179 --> 00:19:28.000]  I'm not going to explain what it is over the radio here, but people can Google Wizenator.
[00:19:28.761 --> 00:19:30.341]  Well, explain what the Wizenator is.
[00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:31.442]  We're just trying to find out here.
[00:19:32.022 --> 00:19:32.882]  You want me to explain it?
[00:19:33.302 --> 00:19:34.563]  Well, I mean, is it horrible?
[00:19:34.603 --> 00:19:35.343]  Well, no.
[00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:36.804]  It's like you put it in your underwear.
[00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:37.744]  It's like a fake penis.
[00:19:38.204 --> 00:19:38.564]  Oh, okay.
[00:19:38.604 --> 00:19:39.084]  Never mind.
[00:19:39.104 --> 00:19:41.325]  I didn't know what you were talking about.
[00:19:41.485 --> 00:19:45.186]  I just heard that there were fake businesses of fake synthetic urine.
[00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.507]  I thought it was bad.
[00:19:47.607 --> 00:19:48.248]  No, I understand.
[00:19:48.288 --> 00:19:51.049]  Then they're being watched doing it for their job.
[00:19:51.209 --> 00:19:52.049]  Okay, now I understand.
[00:19:53.547 --> 00:19:54.988]  Okay, I didn't know what that was.
[00:19:55.048 --> 00:19:56.468]  I'm sorry I brought that up, folks.
[00:19:59.869 --> 00:20:01.230]  It's so ridiculous, man.
[00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:03.211]  Oh my God.
[00:20:03.591 --> 00:20:05.892]  You can either order the McCain or the Obama model.
[00:20:07.532 --> 00:20:08.473]  Stop it, Booth!
[00:20:09.373 --> 00:20:09.853]  Stop it.
[00:20:09.873 --> 00:20:10.634]  He's a comedian.
[00:20:10.694 --> 00:20:11.554]  He's out of control.
[00:20:12.414 --> 00:20:13.555]  Hey, how's Joe Rogan doing?
[00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:15.695]  I haven't seen him, you know?
[00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:16.896]  I haven't talked to him lately.
[00:20:16.976 --> 00:20:18.076]  I haven't called him lately either.
[00:20:18.316 --> 00:20:18.657]  Yeah.
[00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:19.937]  I know he's touring around.
[00:20:19.977 --> 00:20:22.318]  I think he was in Canada recently, so I think he's just
[00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.191]  Doing a lot of dates on the road.
[00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:27.092]  Doing a lot of dates.
[00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:30.874]  So what else is going on?
[00:20:30.914 --> 00:20:35.616]  Did I ever tell you that I drove, I got to drive a fully electric car?
[00:20:35.996 --> 00:20:39.558]  That it was the car from the movie who killed the electric car?
[00:20:40.999 --> 00:20:42.820]  And I just want to tell all your listeners that
[00:20:44.647 --> 00:20:45.308]  It was amazing.
[00:20:46.009 --> 00:20:47.670]  It was a Toyota RAV4.
[00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.412]  This thing had acceleration.
[00:20:49.472 --> 00:20:52.995]  You couldn't even tell the difference between... I thought it would be like driving a golf cart or something.
[00:20:53.055 --> 00:20:56.037]  No, it was like driving a completely normal car.
[00:20:56.818 --> 00:20:58.399]  About a range of 90 miles.
[00:20:58.419 --> 00:20:59.500]  But you can't have that.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.443]  Alcata is behind all the alternative energy.
[00:21:02.863 --> 00:21:03.924]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.345 --> 00:21:06.286]  I'm telling you, the battery-powered cars will work.
[00:21:06.346 --> 00:21:08.088]  Maybe not for long range, but close range.
[00:21:09.798 --> 00:21:11.840]  American Drug War, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.581]  It's the film.
[00:21:12.621 --> 00:21:14.083]  Again, available at Infowars.com.
[00:21:14.103 --> 00:21:18.687]  You know, I get on the phone with Kevin doing radio, and it's like I'm on the phone just screwing around here.
[00:21:18.728 --> 00:21:19.749]  But that's interesting radio.
[00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:21.571]  Everything's going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:21:22.491 --> 00:21:26.255]  You know, they'll put you in jail for marijuana, but they put deadly sodium fluoride in your water.
[00:21:27.297 --> 00:21:28.037]  And ice cream.
[00:21:28.077 --> 00:21:29.339]  Children's ice cream, Mandrake.
[00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:32.117]  Oh my gosh.
[00:21:32.177 --> 00:21:33.279]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:33.299 --> 00:21:35.901]  I've got a surprise guest, Ethan Nadelman, joining us.
[00:21:36.042 --> 00:21:36.922]  We're on the march.
[00:21:37.423 --> 00:21:39.005]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:39.365 --> 00:21:40.146]  It's Kevin Booth.
[00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:41.487]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio.
[00:21:41.507 --> 00:21:42.729]  Let's keep talking to Ol' Kevvy.
[00:21:45.566 --> 00:21:51.292]  No, Kev, I mean, the truth is they are fighting tooth and nail to try to keep the drug war in place, and we should explain.
[00:21:51.332 --> 00:21:53.614]  They consciously know they're shipping the drugs in.
[00:21:53.994 --> 00:21:56.237]  They consciously know it's to get everybody in the system.
[00:21:56.957 --> 00:22:00.060]  And that just lets you know what even bigger crooks these narcotics officers are.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.202]  I mean, they really are disgusting.
[00:22:02.263 --> 00:22:05.526]  Have you seen those blimp things that they fly over the Mexican border?
[00:22:06.287 --> 00:22:08.349]  Yep, they've got those over major cities now, too.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:09.160]  Yeah.
[00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:11.602]  This guy, have you heard of this guy Yoakam?
[00:22:11.843 --> 00:22:14.885]  He was a narcotics officer that was involved with those blimps.
[00:22:15.045 --> 00:22:15.466]  You heard of him?
[00:22:15.846 --> 00:22:16.567]  Yeah, blimps.
[00:22:17.608 --> 00:22:27.376]  The whole war on drugs, for those that don't know, is about cutting out their competition at the border and sending troops in to kill growers of coca and other things in Columbia.
[00:22:28.197 --> 00:22:30.358]  And then domestically, it's about putting you in jail.
[00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:32.080]  It's a business.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:32.760]  They're cold-blooded.
[00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:34.202]  They think it's real funny.
[00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:41.504]  I've even heard G. Gordon Liddy laughing on radio going, eh, we're spraying your weed with poison, go ahead and smoke it, you're going to get cancer.
[00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:44.405]  It's all real funny.
[00:22:45.346 --> 00:22:55.671]  But that's, I mean, but really that's what anybody who thinks this is either a conspiracy theory or that thinks drugs are like, but drugs are bad, but drugs are bad, you know, this is not funny to joke about.
[00:22:56.488 --> 00:23:03.429]  You just need to keep telling, you gotta know though that the people that are doing this are getting rich off of it, and that's what's propelling it all.
[00:23:03.729 --> 00:23:09.930]  You know, that's... Well, it's like from Chicago to Dallas where the cops throw fake chalk in your car and just take it because they want it.
[00:23:10.811 --> 00:23:11.151]  Absolutely.
[00:23:11.171 --> 00:23:15.671]  I mean, I've read Seattle Post-Intelligencer articles where the majority of bars are now owned by cops.
[00:23:16.171 --> 00:23:24.373]  They go sell drugs to themselves in the bathroom, then they seize your bar, and then it's so corrupt the cops then hand the bars to their buddies.
[00:23:25.353 --> 00:23:27.814]  But Alex, we got a brand new Humvee out of it.
[00:23:31.896 --> 00:23:32.617]  Whatever, man.
[00:23:33.697 --> 00:23:35.598]  I just can't believe how corrupt this country is.
[00:23:36.598 --> 00:23:38.059]  It really is a dirtbag nation.
[00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:43.622]  I mean, I love the country itself and our history, but we really are just this delusional evil.
[00:23:43.642 --> 00:23:45.943]  I mean, what's coming up with this crap?
[00:23:46.363 --> 00:23:47.744]  When did everybody get so greedy?
[00:23:47.964 --> 00:23:53.847]  What meeting did I miss when everybody got so greedy that they just didn't care anymore about the outcome of anything?
[00:23:55.336 --> 00:23:59.938]  Well that's the thing and so now the cops go along with this and the bankers are taking their pension funds right now.
[00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:04.480]  They're nationalizing pension funds in Argentina, they're getting ready to do it here.
[00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:11.284]  Pension funds are invested in stock markets, they're going to call it, oh we're nationalizing them to keep them safe.
[00:24:12.204 --> 00:24:14.305]  We're raiding them to keep them safe.
[00:24:16.066 --> 00:24:22.189]  Evil people always think they're in a bubble and that they're only screwing people and that they're not going to get screwed.
[00:24:23.379 --> 00:24:24.059]  Well, let me ask you this.
[00:24:24.099 --> 00:24:27.020]  How do you think George Bush is going to spend the next four years of his life?
[00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:29.882]  He never ran anything.
[00:24:30.562 --> 00:24:34.343]  I know, but... I mean, that movie is all about how he's this idiot savant bumbling idiot.
[00:24:34.383 --> 00:24:35.043]  Oh, poor thing.
[00:24:35.284 --> 00:24:37.024]  They really thought WMDs were in Iraq.
[00:24:37.044 --> 00:24:37.885]  I think it's disgusting.
[00:24:37.905 --> 00:24:39.885]  I haven't seen it yet.
[00:24:39.965 --> 00:24:41.506]  I mean, he'll still do what he always does.
[00:24:41.526 --> 00:24:43.787]  Gay porn star visits every day.
[00:24:43.847 --> 00:24:44.187]  Drugs.
[00:24:44.227 --> 00:24:44.567]  Partying.
[00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:45.748]  He likes it.
[00:24:46.788 --> 00:24:47.188]  Here we go.
[00:24:47.288 --> 00:24:50.309]  And do you think any steam is going to come out of the big Leoci deal?
[00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:51.250]  Here we go.
[00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:51.890]  Let's go back live.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.602]  Kevin, during the break, was bringing up something to me that I haven't really talked about yet.
[00:24:59.622 --> 00:25:02.403]  What do you think the pardons will be like this time?
[00:25:02.423 --> 00:25:07.845]  You know, Clinton murderers, drug dealers, cocaine smugglers, white collar criminals, Israeli spies.
[00:25:08.886 --> 00:25:12.067]  I wonder who George Bush is going to pardon this time, Kevin.
[00:25:14.468 --> 00:25:14.888]  I don't know.
[00:25:16.869 --> 00:25:17.510]  John Walters?
[00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:24.933]  What about, what about, yeah, you were bringing up Bugliosi, you know, calling for his indictment for murder.
[00:25:26.104 --> 00:25:28.585]  But if you believe the W film, Bush didn't know.
[00:25:28.645 --> 00:25:29.685]  He's a nice person.
[00:25:31.446 --> 00:25:33.126]  Yeah, well, either way.
[00:25:33.966 --> 00:25:34.427]  Either way.
[00:25:34.447 --> 00:25:38.628]  You've got to ask yourself, though, just the mentality behind this.
[00:25:38.648 --> 00:25:39.768]  We're talking about greed.
[00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:46.370]  I wouldn't trade places with any of these people for a trillion dollars.
[00:25:49.411 --> 00:25:51.452]  What did they get out of doing this?
[00:25:51.572 --> 00:25:52.672]  What are they getting out of it?
[00:25:52.712 --> 00:25:55.153]  I know you could say power and money, but
[00:25:57.895 --> 00:26:01.537]  I don't get it.
[00:26:03.318 --> 00:26:04.399]  It's a competitiveness.
[00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:07.961]  And they're all pushing for global domination.
[00:26:08.826 --> 00:26:14.769]  And somehow they convinced the public that didn't exist and that government was loving and didn't have any avarice or any, you know, bad aims.
[00:26:15.189 --> 00:26:22.533]  I mean, have you been watching the news where they're just announcing world government to be run by the private banks and it doesn't matter, they're the ones that engineered it and it's all over the news.
[00:26:22.994 --> 00:26:28.837]  Even the New York Times reports they're just keeping the money for the shareholders and $500 million bonuses for CEOs.
[00:26:29.981 --> 00:26:37.606]  You have to ask, though, that what kind of a world are they going to have for themselves if they turn this entire planet into a giant toilet?
[00:26:37.806 --> 00:26:40.348]  Well, they believe that that actually secures their power.
[00:26:40.868 --> 00:26:41.789]  They want to hurt people.
[00:26:41.829 --> 00:26:42.850]  They want to make us all poor.
[00:26:44.531 --> 00:26:46.192]  Because that makes us easier to manage.
[00:26:46.232 --> 00:26:49.714]  They don't want upright, strong, good people with good morals.
[00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:57.700]  They want just a bunch of, you know, globalist controllers and a bunch of evil, backstabbing scum down on the bottom all fighting with each other over diminishing resources.
[00:26:59.249 --> 00:27:00.490]  Yeah, I can see that.
[00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:05.375]  But then how are they going to spend their lives?
[00:27:06.336 --> 00:27:07.357]  They like hurting people.
[00:27:07.397 --> 00:27:08.638]  They like taking things away.
[00:27:08.958 --> 00:27:12.321]  They love brain damaging children with mercury and fluoride.
[00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:14.824]  But then what world are their children going to live in?
[00:27:15.524 --> 00:27:18.027]  Well, they're going to live in cloistered, defended areas.
[00:27:22.278 --> 00:27:23.679]  I mean, I'm telling you what they say.
[00:27:23.879 --> 00:27:26.941]  I'm telling you that's the... I mean, it's evil, Kevin.
[00:27:27.561 --> 00:27:30.363]  You can't judge the world according to your own self who isn't evil.
[00:27:31.183 --> 00:27:37.166]  Do you really think, like, George Bush is going to, like, spit out the rest of his life and Crawford, or is that just up front?
[00:27:37.627 --> 00:27:39.848]  No, he's got a pleasure palace in Dubai.
[00:27:39.888 --> 00:27:40.548]  He's going over there.
[00:27:40.908 --> 00:27:41.529]  He's going to Dubai.
[00:27:42.253 --> 00:27:51.399]  Yeah, so is Cheney, where they can, you know... Well, Cheney likes girls, he likes boys, but... I'm serious, I mean, you know, for a Michael Jackson win, it's where you can do what you want.
[00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:52.160]  Yeah.
[00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:55.442]  So what do you think about Palin?
[00:27:55.462 --> 00:28:04.428]  Do you think she's for real, or do you think they just picked her knowing that she was going to make everybody just so... I mean... No, no, she's meant to make McCain lose.
[00:28:04.448 --> 00:28:06.309]  That's why they ran a guy who's a cancer patient.
[00:28:06.809 --> 00:28:07.089]  Yeah.
[00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.751]  No, I mean, Obama's the savior, pal.
[00:28:09.887 --> 00:28:11.988]  Look, I like Rivera, but I'm going to get him on Monday.
[00:28:12.229 --> 00:28:12.789]  What really happened?
[00:28:13.129 --> 00:28:21.515]  I heard him yesterday on Genesis, driving around in a car, on 9.1, and saying, oh, look at Wall Street, they're all behind McCain.
[00:28:21.975 --> 00:28:28.139]  Wall Street's given three times the money to Obama than McCain, and I'm not picking somebody here.
[00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:28.840]  They're both bad.
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.361]  But Obama is meant to win, Kevin.
[00:28:32.602 --> 00:28:33.483]  Oh, I know, I know.
[00:28:34.063 --> 00:28:36.525]  But I mean, you know,
[00:28:37.435 --> 00:28:40.516]  Our own people are drinking the Kool-Aid on this Obama guy.
[00:28:40.656 --> 00:28:51.458]  I'm just saying, though, that do you think they created Sarah Palin, or do you think they just picked her because knowing how it was really going to go over?
[00:28:51.578 --> 00:29:01.520]  Well, that's how they pick you, is you've already been compromised, you've already gone through the system, they already know your modus operandi, they already know your type, and then they select you.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.284]  So the answer is both, Kevin, in my humble opinion.
[00:29:05.605 --> 00:29:05.885]  Yeah.
[00:29:06.566 --> 00:29:12.598]  I mean, it's just, you know, things like me, just like seeing her shooting animals out of planes is like my final...
[00:29:14.867 --> 00:29:16.268]  I guess that's offensive to me.
[00:29:17.568 --> 00:29:20.009]  Oh, what's wrong with shooting animals out of planes?
[00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.431]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:29.654]  Do you think she's really like that, or do you think that's just part of this whole act that they've portrayed to make you hate this person?
[00:29:29.994 --> 00:29:33.395]  No, there's nothing to do in Alaska but shoot a caribou out of helicopters.
[00:29:33.715 --> 00:29:35.256]  Right, so you really think that's really her?
[00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:37.217]  Oh yeah, she's got the husband that's all into it.
[00:29:37.617 --> 00:29:37.897]  Yeah.
[00:29:38.077 --> 00:29:38.557]  No, I know.
[00:29:38.577 --> 00:29:39.398]  I mean, I know what they said.
[00:29:39.418 --> 00:29:39.998]  I just want to help.
[00:29:40.038 --> 00:29:40.638]  No, no, Kevin.
[00:29:40.658 --> 00:29:44.900]  Kevin, I actually... If I close the door on a gecko... Well, you've lived in Texas.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.941]  You know, the geckos are running in and out of your house.
[00:29:47.961 --> 00:29:50.643]  I mean, you're constantly finding them, little cute little pink things.
[00:29:51.363 --> 00:29:52.083]  And I really like them.
[00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.744]  I watch them eat bugs up in the light at night.
[00:29:54.464 --> 00:30:02.388]  And, you know, I'll close the door and cut one in half and I can pick up its little bloody body and dig a little hole and bury it, put a little cross there, you know.
[00:30:02.528 --> 00:30:04.869]  I mean, I don't like... As I've gotten older,
[00:30:06.029 --> 00:30:08.091]  And more maternal, I guess.
[00:30:08.291 --> 00:30:08.951]  I don't like things.
[00:30:08.991 --> 00:30:12.894]  But at the same time, people will say, don't hunt, it's evil.
[00:30:12.914 --> 00:30:15.956]  But then they go get a hamburger when the cow was tortured to death.
[00:30:16.016 --> 00:30:16.476]  No, I know.
[00:30:16.496 --> 00:30:20.739]  But I mean, I understand you're saying the image of her shooting a wolf for fun.
[00:30:20.779 --> 00:30:23.021]  I mean, that's different than slaughtering cows.
[00:30:23.061 --> 00:30:24.562]  Oh, I didn't know she was shooting wolves.
[00:30:25.102 --> 00:30:26.743]  Yeah, she's shooting wolves.
[00:30:27.524 --> 00:30:29.325]  And you have wolves, so you don't like them.
[00:30:29.884 --> 00:30:32.446]  Yeah, I mean, that becomes like a personal issue for me.
[00:30:32.486 --> 00:30:36.008]  I just wanted to see what your opinion is, if that's like for real.
[00:30:36.028 --> 00:30:37.710]  See, I haven't paid much attention.
[00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.511]  I didn't know she was running around shooting wolves.
[00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:40.151]  Yeah.
[00:30:41.612 --> 00:30:43.914]  There's all kinds of petitions about that, anyway.
[00:30:43.934 --> 00:30:49.198]  I was looking for that hanging Sarah Palin doll that's somewhere down in my neighborhood over here.
[00:30:49.218 --> 00:30:50.338]  I was driving around yesterday.
[00:30:51.179 --> 00:30:53.200]  They made them take it down and threatened to arrest them.
[00:30:53.721 --> 00:30:54.761]  Ah, gosh.
[00:30:55.942 --> 00:30:56.543]  That's funny.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.162]  Hey, North Hollywood to install talking cameras.
[00:31:02.922 --> 00:31:03.562]  I saw that.
[00:31:03.902 --> 00:31:06.884]  Yeah, and it's going to shout orders just like 1984 at you.
[00:31:06.984 --> 00:31:08.024]  These are going in everywhere.
[00:31:08.044 --> 00:31:10.806]  Maybe we should go film the cameras.
[00:31:12.107 --> 00:31:16.949]  Well, no, people have tried that and the cops show up and say, you're not allowed to do that, boy!
[00:31:16.969 --> 00:31:18.770]  You ain't got no freedom!
[00:31:20.932 --> 00:31:27.613]  I mean, how do they get that in their head that they can shove cameras down our throats and put them in restaurant bathrooms, but we're not supposed to film them?
[00:31:29.734 --> 00:31:31.354]  These camera things, yeah.
[00:31:31.394 --> 00:31:34.335]  There's so many of those camera things out here that are even built to trick you.
[00:31:34.915 --> 00:31:38.536]  You know, with the leash, not dog leash things.
[00:31:38.556 --> 00:31:42.196]  That's coming, actually, where they're going to have cameras in parks.
[00:31:42.236 --> 00:31:44.937]  They already have that in Florida and in areas of England.
[00:31:45.417 --> 00:31:49.138]  Have you heard on CNN now, they're going to have their correspondence as holograms?
[00:31:50.473 --> 00:31:53.095]  CNN beams Star Wars technology for election night.
[00:31:53.115 --> 00:31:54.335]  This is the New York Observer.
[00:31:57.697 --> 00:31:59.639]  James Cameron, you know, is pioneering all that.
[00:32:00.579 --> 00:32:02.100]  Oh, that's cool.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.701]  But where?
[00:32:03.441 --> 00:32:07.764]  Wolf Blitzer Show and others, they're going to have the reporter shot from three directions by cameras.
[00:32:07.804 --> 00:32:10.365]  They'll be standing there as a hologram while he interviews them.
[00:32:11.146 --> 00:32:11.526]  Wow.
[00:32:12.046 --> 00:32:13.207]  I mean, where do you go to see this?
[00:32:14.969 --> 00:32:15.109]  CNN.
[00:32:15.129 --> 00:32:17.890]  Okay, so they're just going to show them doing it, okay.
[00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:18.850]  Yeah, how will it work?
[00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:24.712]  CNN will be shooting with 44 cameras at each location simultaneously, 20 computers at the site, combined with New York's office hardware.
[00:32:25.133 --> 00:32:27.133]  We'll process and project an image into the studio.
[00:32:27.693 --> 00:32:34.816]  The subject will see Mr. Blitzer and other CNNers on TVs at the locations so they can communicate with them properly.
[00:32:35.336 --> 00:32:37.757]  And I say it's just going to be like Princess Leia, but full size.
[00:32:40.114 --> 00:32:47.060]  Too bad they couldn't have like a giant Obama standing on top of the Empire State Building, addressing the world.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.103]  Well, that's what they're doing over Dallas and other places with all these big flying saucers.
[00:32:51.964 --> 00:32:59.410]  If you look at the phenomenon, most of those are high-powered holograms, which the Pentagon even admitted in the 80s they were developing to fool people.
[00:33:00.671 --> 00:33:04.754]  Look, I guarantee you, they're going to have Jesus pop up and tell everybody to take the microchip and they're going to do it.
[00:33:07.093 --> 00:33:10.054]  It'll be like in Monty Python, a big, TAKE THE CHIP!
[00:33:10.614 --> 00:33:12.475]  What did you think about Religulous?
[00:33:13.455 --> 00:33:14.515]  I didn't see Religulous.
[00:33:14.875 --> 00:33:15.435]  You didn't see it?
[00:33:18.076 --> 00:33:18.556]  You should go see it.
[00:33:18.576 --> 00:33:20.137]  Hey, have you heard?
[00:33:20.197 --> 00:33:24.698]  Bin Laden, on the eve of this election, like every other election, is going to pop up with a new video for us.
[00:33:25.218 --> 00:33:28.379]  And the government, of course, can announce that beforehand for us to get the media all hyped.
[00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:30.280]  I mean, how staged does this have to get?
[00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:55.806]  I know, actually, I've got a friend of mine, T-Sean, he's a writer at Saturday Night Live, and I kept telling him, I was like, you guys should do a, you guys gotta do like a Ben Laden press release skit, you know, it would be perfect, you know, but have it where they're in a cave and it looks just like the White House press room with an official Al Qaeda flag, an official Al Qaeda logo behind them and everything like that.
[00:33:57.219 --> 00:34:00.901]  And you could have the McCain character dressed up in a tribal thing, I don't know.
[00:34:01.841 --> 00:34:03.462]  But no, that's classic, of course.
[00:34:04.462 --> 00:34:19.408]  Well, I mean, when the Intel Center that uploads these keeps uploading the video with their logo in the same video layer as Al Qaeda's logo... They really think we're stupid, Kevin, I tell you.
[00:34:20.528 --> 00:34:21.589]  You know, we laugh about it, but
[00:34:24.471 --> 00:34:26.912]  The big thing is they're getting ready for bioweapons releases.
[00:34:27.493 --> 00:34:31.195]  And if people don't think people running our government won't kill 30, 40 million of us, you've got another thing coming.
[00:34:32.155 --> 00:34:33.336]  But let me ask you this.
[00:34:33.356 --> 00:34:38.218]  Do you think it's a bad thing that so many young kids have gotten enthusiastic about Obama?
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:46.162]  Yeah, it's bad because, see, they're taking all the discontent and making people think it's different because the guy has a different colored skin.
[00:34:48.684 --> 00:34:49.324]  Well, just watch.
[00:34:49.364 --> 00:34:50.625]  Just watch what happens with Obama.
[00:34:51.425 --> 00:34:52.926]  Okay, so what are you saying is going to happen?
[00:34:55.495 --> 00:34:58.297]  I mean, he's all for the New World Order banking system taking over.
[00:34:58.357 --> 00:35:00.158]  He's all for youth brigades.
[00:35:00.238 --> 00:35:01.038]  It's going to be bad.
[00:35:01.498 --> 00:35:01.838]  Get ready.
[00:35:01.858 --> 00:35:03.219]  It's going to be real bad.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.762]  But the American people have never seen a scam they didn't love, so you know.
[00:35:10.503 --> 00:35:17.567]  I mean, Kevin, they're openly taking all the bailout money and giving it to none of the in trouble institutions and just hoarding it all and giving it to themselves as bonuses.
[00:35:18.007 --> 00:35:24.671]  And the New York Times even reports, I've got the quotes right here, New York Times
[00:35:27.059 --> 00:35:27.760]  Came out yesterday.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.083]  I'm not talking about legal insider trading by corporate officers that financial press follows.
[00:35:32.103 --> 00:35:37.967]  I'm talking about the ministers and executives and it just goes on into all of it.
[00:35:38.588 --> 00:35:41.810]  And it's got the New York Times here with the quotes.
[00:35:41.891 --> 00:35:55.101]  It's got them recording the Goldman Sachs executives just bragging about how it's a great opportunity for them to consolidate and buy up more banks and give themselves record bonuses.
[00:35:56.246 --> 00:35:56.766]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:35:56.806 --> 00:35:57.186]  Yeah.
[00:35:57.226 --> 00:35:57.326]  Yeah.
[00:36:15.017 --> 00:36:16.738]  So what do you think is going to happen with all this?
[00:36:17.298 --> 00:36:20.620]  I mean, what happens when there's criminals running the government and nothing can stop them?
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.541]  The sky's the limit, pal!
[00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:24.822]  Well, we've been in that mode for quite some time.
[00:36:24.862 --> 00:36:28.164]  Yeah, but I mean, now they are just doing anything and everything.
[00:36:28.664 --> 00:36:31.646]  It is just total corruption.
[00:36:32.787 --> 00:36:33.667]  But how do you see this thing?
[00:36:33.707 --> 00:36:37.169]  Do you see this thing as just a slow ramping up of chaos?
[00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:38.470]  Yes.
[00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.471]  Incremental chaos, yes.
[00:36:41.871 --> 00:36:42.572]  I like that term.
[00:36:43.817 --> 00:36:44.457]  Good answer.
[00:36:44.597 --> 00:36:45.518]  I'll be watching you.
[00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:47.579]  Sam Kennison live.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.060]  Kevin, I can't get no respect.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:52.501]  You know that?
[00:36:56.302 --> 00:36:56.962]  Oh my God.
[00:36:57.443 --> 00:36:58.083]  No respect.
[00:36:58.183 --> 00:36:58.803]  No respect.
[00:36:59.824 --> 00:37:01.644]  I can't think of any Rodney Dangerfield joke.
[00:37:01.864 --> 00:37:02.245]  Dang it.
[00:37:02.885 --> 00:37:04.686]  I used to be able to fire off Dangerfield.
[00:37:08.407 --> 00:37:09.868]  It's now official.
[00:37:10.168 --> 00:37:12.649]  Russell Crowe's talked about the movie, the Bill Hicks movie.
[00:37:13.464 --> 00:37:13.704]  Yeah.
[00:37:14.344 --> 00:37:15.164]  But we won't get into that.
[00:37:15.184 --> 00:37:16.265]  We won't get into that.
[00:37:16.425 --> 00:37:17.525]  I'm sworn to secrecy.
[00:37:18.325 --> 00:37:19.265]  We're not going to get into that.
[00:37:22.126 --> 00:37:24.246]  No, I mean, I'm here reading all this stuff, Kevin.
[00:37:24.286 --> 00:37:26.847]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:37:27.307 --> 00:37:35.649]  And so now they're saying, OK, maybe we'll take $50 million of the multi-trillion, it's not $100 billion, and maybe we'll give $50 billion to banks that actually have mortgage trouble.
[00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:39.910]  Yeah.
[00:37:41.358 --> 00:37:43.960]  How are you going to choose who to help or how to help?
[00:37:44.321 --> 00:37:48.004]  That's a really odd problem.
[00:37:48.044 --> 00:37:55.089]  Here's the JP Morgan CEO as recorded by the New York Times in a banking teleconference.
[00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.351]  And they're all over the news saying this.
[00:37:57.391 --> 00:38:07.239]  He says, What we do think is it will help us is perhaps a little bit more active on the acquisition side or optimistic side for some banks who are still struggling.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.641]  That means buying up banks.
[00:38:08.681 --> 00:38:09.942]  And I would still assume that we are
[00:38:11.673 --> 00:38:15.454]  Done on the acquisition side, just because of the Washington Mutual or Bear Stearns mergers.
[00:38:15.954 --> 00:38:32.899]  I think there are going to be some great opportunities for us to grow in this environment, and I think we have an opportunity to use the $25 billion in that way, and obviously depending on whether recession turns into depression, or what happens in the future, you know we will have that as a backstop.
[00:38:34.539 --> 00:38:37.760]  And then he goes on to say they're not going to give any of it to people in loans.
[00:38:39.212 --> 00:38:42.793]  We've got to do this to get credit going, and they're literally just giving themselves bonuses.
[00:38:43.173 --> 00:38:51.136]  Goldman Sachs England, just that division, is giving $14 billion in bonuses to their executives.
[00:38:51.556 --> 00:38:53.556]  Out of the money directly that England gave.
[00:38:55.717 --> 00:38:56.477]  And then in the U.S.
[00:38:56.497 --> 00:38:58.758]  they just say, we're keeping the money, but all that's secret.
[00:38:59.038 --> 00:39:00.439]  Read the bill Congress passed.
[00:39:00.659 --> 00:39:01.739]  You're not allowed to look at it.
[00:39:04.352 --> 00:39:11.336]  Meanwhile they've got cops raiding our houses looking for marijuana when the government ships in all the real drugs.
[00:39:11.396 --> 00:39:12.497]  I'm tired of it, man!
[00:39:13.338 --> 00:39:14.859]  You have no legitimacy!
[00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:15.879]  Get out of my face!
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.401]  Well, what do you think is going to happen?
[00:39:18.421 --> 00:39:28.947]  Do you think, though, that if it comes out and everybody finds out that Obama was a big scam or that everybody becomes quickly disillusioned with the whole Obama thing?
[00:39:29.588 --> 00:39:33.350]  Don't you think now with all these younger people motivated that
[00:39:33.942 --> 00:39:36.204]  We could be closer to some sort of revolution.
[00:39:36.224 --> 00:39:40.107]  Yeah, and that's why they got the army ready, and the brigades deployed, and the microwave guns.
[00:39:40.567 --> 00:39:42.128]  But that's all meant to fail as well.
[00:39:42.629 --> 00:39:43.809]  They want total breakdown.
[00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:45.230]  They want depression, Kevin.
[00:39:48.273 --> 00:39:54.778]  Plus, the media will puff Obama up for a few years, and then destroy him, and then give you somebody else.
[00:39:54.798 --> 00:39:55.778]  See, they're experts at that.
[00:39:56.039 --> 00:39:59.161]  They build him up, they knock him down, they go, oh, there's a new savior.
[00:40:00.142 --> 00:40:02.483]  But the public is figuring out that scam, by and large.
[00:40:02.503 --> 00:40:03.104]  So, I don't know.
[00:40:04.925 --> 00:40:06.467]  How far do you think this thing is going to go?
[00:40:06.507 --> 00:40:16.797]  Do you picture it like gas stations closed, grocery stores closed, gangs of people running through the street looking for food?
[00:40:17.778 --> 00:40:19.680]  It could very easily get to that point.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:20.581]  I hope not.
[00:40:23.624 --> 00:40:25.285]  Hope for the best, prepare for the worst, Kevin.
[00:40:27.535 --> 00:40:30.556]  I just know this, we need to arrest everybody that smokes marijuana immediately.
[00:40:30.776 --> 00:40:31.376]  That's for sure.
[00:40:31.496 --> 00:40:32.396]  That'll keep us safe.
[00:40:32.456 --> 00:40:38.918]  Not the 2,000 deaths on the Texas-Mexico border just this year, the rocket attacks, the murders, cops being killed everywhere.
[00:40:39.258 --> 00:40:40.679]  That's not a problem, Kevin.
[00:40:41.519 --> 00:40:43.059]  Of course, all caused by the drug war.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:49.161]  Even Mexico is saying decriminalize now, because they are now admitting that that's what's destroyed their country.
[00:40:49.701 --> 00:40:55.423]  Yeah, didn't even the drug lords agree to some change in the Mexican drug laws?
[00:40:56.505 --> 00:40:58.706]  Yeah, because the whole society is falling apart.
[00:40:58.766 --> 00:41:05.988]  I mean, look, the British used drug prohibition in China to bring it down, because they could ship the opium in and then buy off the cops and locals.
[00:41:07.968 --> 00:41:14.950]  Again, folks, all these drugs would be dirt cheap and be looked down on societally, but you make it illegal and all the bling, then everybody wants to do it.
[00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:18.031]  I mean, they know what they're doing, folks.
[00:41:18.051 --> 00:41:21.092]  When they lost alcohol prohibition, they then criminalized drugs.
[00:41:22.373 --> 00:41:23.893]  Maybe our society's got to just
[00:41:24.577 --> 00:41:28.019]  Crumble a little bit for everybody to readjust or something.
[00:41:28.059 --> 00:41:28.559]  I don't know.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.501]  You know, as far as the drug war ending, because it has to.
[00:41:34.222 --> 00:41:34.602]  I don't know.
[00:41:37.664 --> 00:41:38.525]  They're never going to stop.
[00:41:38.565 --> 00:41:42.427]  There's Roydheads who like SWAT teaming and like killing people and like stealing drugs.
[00:41:42.887 --> 00:41:43.747]  And they're not going to stop.
[00:41:44.588 --> 00:41:45.568]  They are the drug dealers.
[00:41:45.608 --> 00:41:46.689]  They know they're shipping it.
[00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:48.430]  Most of them are on the take.
[00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:53.653]  I mean, I just... Again, our government is a rancid, maggot-covered pile of dead meat.
[00:41:55.353 --> 00:41:57.254]  So what do you think we should do to take the country back?
[00:41:58.315 --> 00:42:05.140]  We should just point out that it's a pack of criminals running things and delegitimize it so they have no clout so it just grinds to a halt.
[00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:07.842]  I mean the best thing we can hope for is just a collapse.
[00:42:09.143 --> 00:42:12.005]  Instead they want to have a controlled collapse to give them total power.
[00:42:14.007 --> 00:42:14.927]  So we need to have
[00:42:17.145 --> 00:42:19.207]  We need to have a system where that doesn't happen, Kevin.
[00:42:19.227 --> 00:42:28.534]  I'm going to have to have you back up next week, briefly, Kevin, with the guest, because the guest you wanted to set up, Ethan Nadelman, probably got his time zone scrambled, so he never called in.
[00:42:28.554 --> 00:42:31.856]  He didn't call in?
[00:42:32.297 --> 00:42:34.438]  No, he didn't call in or we would have had him on, Kevin.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.542]  No, I thought he was getting ready to come up.
[00:42:39.582 --> 00:42:41.023]  No, we would just leave him on hold, Kevin.
[00:42:41.063 --> 00:42:41.644]  That's what we've done.
[00:42:42.304 --> 00:42:43.165]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:42:43.185 --> 00:42:43.605]  Stay with us.
[00:42:45.166 --> 00:42:45.627]  Hey, Kevin?
[00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:47.628]  Hey, Kevin.
[00:42:49.189 --> 00:42:49.710]  Is he still there?
[00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:50.310]  Yeah.
[00:42:51.131 --> 00:42:53.613]  Hey, anyways, uh, yeah, he never called in.
[00:42:53.633 --> 00:42:54.133]  Did he, Harmon?
[00:42:54.993 --> 00:42:55.914]  No, he never called in.
[00:42:57.916 --> 00:42:58.716]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:03.980]  Well, let me, if he didn't call in, then let me just go back to this Prop 5 thing one more time and just do a little plug.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.061]  Alright, but just do it briefly.
[00:43:05.121 --> 00:43:06.862]  I got a couple sponsors I gotta plug.
[00:43:07.142 --> 00:43:09.283]  Okay, just, what, like five minutes or something?
[00:43:09.904 --> 00:43:12.145]  Yeah, yeah, let's get into, what's up, uh, Trey?
[00:43:12.185 --> 00:43:13.707]  I'm gonna get going, is that okay?
[00:43:14.087 --> 00:43:14.307]  Yeah.
[00:43:14.567 --> 00:43:15.528]  Okay, I'll see you Sunday.
[00:43:16.809 --> 00:43:17.869]  All right, I'll see you, Keebler.
[00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:19.010]  Okay.
[00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.450]  No, I'm not saying bye to you.
[00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:21.771]  I was saying bye to Trey.
[00:43:23.091 --> 00:43:24.231]  Everyone is known as Keebler.
[00:43:26.132 --> 00:43:26.992]  What's up in there, Bob?
[00:43:28.613 --> 00:43:29.253]  I'll keep going.
[00:43:29.313 --> 00:43:30.133]  We're on air right now, right?
[00:43:30.153 --> 00:43:33.474]  I don't know what's so pleasing out there to everybody.
[00:43:34.174 --> 00:43:35.035]  Oh, we're on the air right now?
[00:43:35.395 --> 00:43:36.415]  Yes, we're on the air right now.
[00:43:36.435 --> 00:43:37.275]  Oh, God, I keep forgetting.
[00:43:37.795 --> 00:43:38.756]  We just skipped the breaks.
[00:43:38.776 --> 00:43:39.716]  We're on the only internet.
[00:43:39.816 --> 00:43:40.796]  All right, all right.
[00:43:40.916 --> 00:43:42.957]  Aggregate hundreds of thousands that are watching or listening.
[00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.551]  Oh, God.
[00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:47.432]  You know, I'm kind of too relaxed today, Kevin.
[00:43:48.453 --> 00:43:49.374]  Yeah, it's a weird day.
[00:43:49.414 --> 00:43:50.434]  Well, happy Halloween.
[00:43:52.416 --> 00:43:53.817]  Happy Halloween.
[00:43:53.837 --> 00:43:56.179]  You gonna do anything?
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.500]  Happy Samhain?
[00:44:00.542 --> 00:44:03.504]  No, we're gonna shutter our windows and lock the doors.
[00:44:03.544 --> 00:44:05.205]  The little goblins bang on it.
[00:44:05.966 --> 00:44:08.248]  Scratching their nails in the dark night.
[00:44:08.788 --> 00:44:10.009]  Begging for goodies.
[00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.331]  You have lots of kids in your neighborhood?
[00:44:13.186 --> 00:44:14.306]  Yeah, no, we're not going to do that.
[00:44:14.326 --> 00:44:16.247]  We end up giving them candy, but we don't really celebrate it.
[00:44:17.007 --> 00:44:17.227]  Yeah.
[00:44:17.867 --> 00:44:24.669]  We have to give the little ghouls their, uh, their, uh, their booty, or what's the proper, their tribute.
[00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:30.991]  Trick or treat, smell my feet, give me something good to eat.
[00:44:31.811 --> 00:44:32.951]  How does the rest of it go, Kevin?
[00:44:33.532 --> 00:44:34.012]  I don't know.
[00:44:38.673 --> 00:44:41.574]  Yeah, I'm still knocked out from hanging out with Willie five days later.
[00:44:42.972 --> 00:44:44.113]  Where were you on the tour bus?
[00:44:45.034 --> 00:44:46.615]  All over his house, I'm just joking.
[00:44:46.975 --> 00:44:48.396]  I'm joking to the listeners out there.
[00:44:49.157 --> 00:44:50.618]  I have been more relaxed this week though.
[00:44:52.399 --> 00:44:53.720]  When are you going to come out to California?
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.302]  You know, everybody asks me to come out there, Kev.
[00:44:56.502 --> 00:45:04.908]  I need to come out there and see, before he moves, he's going to Europe, Tommy Pallotta, I need to see Sheen, I need to see you, I need to see a whole bunch of folks out there.
[00:45:05.885 --> 00:45:06.926]  What's Tommy Pallotta doing?
[00:45:07.006 --> 00:45:09.007]  I might be working with Ventura on a TV show.
[00:45:09.067 --> 00:45:10.088]  We'll see what happens with that.
[00:45:10.368 --> 00:45:12.149]  I'll be out there quite a bit if that happens.
[00:45:12.169 --> 00:45:13.090]  Oh, that's cool.
[00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:16.032]  What about Pallotta?
[00:45:16.553 --> 00:45:17.393]  Yeah, what's he doing?
[00:45:18.194 --> 00:45:18.534]  I don't know.
[00:45:18.554 --> 00:45:19.374]  I've been playing phone tech.
[00:45:19.415 --> 00:45:20.135]  He's called me a few times.
[00:45:20.155 --> 00:45:20.936]  I've called him a few times.
[00:45:21.456 --> 00:45:24.858]  He's moving out of the country for a few times to do some thing in Europe or something.
[00:45:26.239 --> 00:45:27.040]  Oh my God.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:31.903]  This has been a nice, relaxed hour.
[00:45:31.943 --> 00:45:32.484]  People want us to...
[00:45:33.325 --> 00:45:34.566]  People want a sedated hour?
[00:45:34.586 --> 00:45:35.847]  I'm just talking about marijuana.
[00:45:35.867 --> 00:45:37.128]  It gives me a placebo effect.
[00:45:38.449 --> 00:45:39.150]  You did that, Weedhead.
[00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:39.830]  I'm just joking.
[00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:40.691]  Okay, here we go.
[00:45:40.711 --> 00:45:42.172]  Imagine all the problems we have in our society.
[00:46:03.717 --> 00:46:08.801]  And there, we've got the police out, tracking, on the tail, looking for Mary Jane.
[00:46:11.043 --> 00:46:18.128]  Looking for that marijuana.
[00:46:19.689 --> 00:46:22.151]  Catch the weedhead rider.
[00:46:23.212 --> 00:46:27.655]  Hey, I'll be back live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., and I am going to shift entirely into election coverage.
[00:46:29.537 --> 00:46:32.239]  The abbreviated Sunday transmission, and Monday, and Tuesday.
[00:46:33.925 --> 00:46:35.166]  Had a pretty good first three hours.
[00:46:35.186 --> 00:46:36.427]  I was pretty hardcore and intense.
[00:46:36.467 --> 00:46:37.387]  Kevin said he was listening.
[00:46:38.068 --> 00:46:38.668]  Sounded pretty angry.
[00:46:38.688 --> 00:46:40.870]  It was pretty good radio and I've been kind of relaxed in this hour.
[00:46:42.371 --> 00:46:43.792]  You know, talking about Mary Jane.
[00:46:47.301 --> 00:46:48.721]  I don't have time to get any more of your calls.
[00:46:48.761 --> 00:46:49.482]  I apologize.
[00:46:49.502 --> 00:46:51.302]  We'll have open phones again Sunday and Monday.
[00:46:51.322 --> 00:46:54.543]  The rebroadcast is about to begin at InfoWars.com.
[00:46:54.943 --> 00:46:55.543]  I hope you will.
[00:46:55.603 --> 00:46:56.343]  Just keep fighting.
[00:46:56.363 --> 00:46:59.264]  I know we get really negative and sometimes I even kind of get gloom and doom on air.
[00:47:00.584 --> 00:47:03.465]  It's like so over the top how dirty and corrupt this government is.
[00:47:03.505 --> 00:47:04.525]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[00:47:04.865 --> 00:47:08.246]  And all the delusional, fake do-gooders that back it up in everything they do.
[00:47:09.684 --> 00:47:13.388]  When they really trashed out a good country, and I've just had enough of it.
[00:47:13.448 --> 00:47:16.091]  This financial looting thing has really gotten me.
[00:47:16.491 --> 00:47:20.575]  I hope folks will go to Infowars.com and get American Drug War, filmed by Kevin Booth.
[00:47:20.595 --> 00:47:23.278]  Two hour film, three hours of extras, really about two or three films in one.
[00:47:23.779 --> 00:47:29.425]  Endgame, Terror Storm, just all the great films we carry and have made at Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:47:32.888 --> 00:47:43.857]  Uh, Kevin, in the last few minutes, tell me about the proposition out in California so the criminal goons that run the government can't grab the people and the non-violent marijuana heads and put them in the slave systems.
[00:47:44.377 --> 00:47:49.261]  Okay, well, it's known as NORA, the Non-Violent Offender Rehabilitation Act.
[00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:55.826]  It's, uh, Proposition 5 will cut state costs and it's, um,
[00:47:56.989 --> 00:48:02.653]  It's being backed by a lot of good people and it's being fought against by some really bad people.
[00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:03.533]  By the parasites.
[00:48:03.893 --> 00:48:05.935]  Yeah, the people who are profiting from running the prison.
[00:48:05.955 --> 00:48:07.776]  The parasites, the pot-bellied demon creatures.
[00:48:08.436 --> 00:48:13.780]  Absolutely, and really, they are going to lose a lot of money if they can't keep all these
[00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:20.615]  Um, non-violent drug offenders behind bars for years and years and years because that's how they make their profit.
[00:48:20.635 --> 00:48:22.736]  Well now they're shifting into the fake environmental stuff.
[00:48:22.756 --> 00:48:26.177]  You'll get prison time for a little battery falling out of your car in the backyard.
[00:48:26.197 --> 00:48:27.298]  Absolutely so.
[00:48:27.478 --> 00:48:28.138]  God help us.
[00:48:28.559 --> 00:48:35.562]  If you don't live in California, but you know someone who does, make sure that, tell them to vote yes on Proposition 5 because I'll tell you,
[00:48:36.441 --> 00:48:42.005]  Uh, you know, if you just watch mainstream TV as I do, uh, it's kind of getting its butt kicked, in my opinion.
[00:48:42.045 --> 00:48:46.569]  These, these little, uh, heroin dealers who rape your children!
[00:48:46.729 --> 00:48:55.956]  No, it is, really, and it has that, uh, that Feinstein woman on here, who's actually, you know, she's actually on the right side of several issues, so it's a very, very sneaky... Demonstein?
[00:48:57.486 --> 00:48:57.686]  Huh?
[00:48:58.026 --> 00:48:59.207]  Senator Diemenstein?
[00:48:59.548 --> 00:48:59.808]  Yeah.
[00:49:00.168 --> 00:49:01.369]  Oh, she's saving us, Kevin?
[00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:02.370]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:03.451]  No, obviously she's not.
[00:49:03.471 --> 00:49:04.552]  She's for the slave grid.
[00:49:04.792 --> 00:49:06.214]  She knows where the cash is!
[00:49:06.234 --> 00:49:10.457]  Hey, do you want meth dealers, like, playing with your children?
[00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:13.220]  That's another thing.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:25.050]  The government made all the stuff, the base ingredients of meth illegal, so the scum that makes it has to then find all these other sub-ingredients, so then it's full of all these toxins and poisons.
[00:49:25.635 --> 00:49:27.076]  It just gets worse and worse.
[00:49:27.136 --> 00:49:28.717]  What happened with ecstasy?
[00:49:28.737 --> 00:49:32.720]  When ecstasy first came out, it was like this pure, clean, legal thing.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.421]  People used it for psychotherapy.
[00:49:34.821 --> 00:49:37.363]  Yes, it could be abused, but just so can anything else.
[00:49:37.523 --> 00:49:40.765]  But then they made it illegal, so they started labeling rat poison as ecstasy.
[00:49:40.785 --> 00:49:49.050]  Right, so now you buy ecstasy, and you can get this stuff that'll cause you to literally have a stroke and shut your brain off.
[00:49:49.311 --> 00:49:51.512]  Look, Midas had the golden touch.
[00:49:52.313 --> 00:49:54.134]  Everything the government touches turns into
[00:49:55.819 --> 00:49:56.439]  Horse poo.
[00:49:58.741 --> 00:50:00.642]  They have the horse poo touch, Kevin.
[00:50:02.263 --> 00:50:04.544]  Alright, americandrugwar.com.
[00:50:05.344 --> 00:50:06.425]  He is Kevin Booth.
[00:50:06.465 --> 00:50:08.326]  And Kevin, I'm going to get you up next week.
[00:50:08.606 --> 00:50:09.847]  Thanks, Walt.
[00:50:09.867 --> 00:50:11.047]  I'm glad I came on here.
[00:50:11.067 --> 00:50:12.888]  Maybe I chilled you out a little bit.
[00:50:12.948 --> 00:50:13.989]  No, you did not chill me out.
[00:50:14.029 --> 00:50:15.170]  I'm just tired, Kevin.
[00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:16.750]  Never!
[00:50:16.951 --> 00:50:17.911]  Retransmission starts now.
[00:50:17.991 --> 00:50:19.032]  Infowars.com.
[00:50:19.252 --> 00:50:22.994]  Let me say bye to you behind the scenes here at PrisonPlanet.tv, Kevin.
[00:50:26.397 --> 00:50:26.897]  Hey, Kevin.
[00:50:27.278 --> 00:50:27.458]  Yeah?
[00:50:28.839 --> 00:50:30.200]  We should have told the Pitbull story.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.843]  I'm getting... Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:33.903 --> 00:50:35.844]  What on earth was that?
[00:50:35.864 --> 00:50:39.247]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:50:39.327 --> 00:50:42.469]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:50:42.689 --> 00:50:44.170]  Hey, John, what kind of audio is this?
[00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:46.552]  It just got like 800 times louder.
[00:50:50.485 --> 00:50:51.246]  Good God!
[00:50:51.646 --> 00:50:53.447]  Did you hear that?
[00:50:53.507 --> 00:50:57.430]  Alright, let me say bye to Kevin real quick.
[00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:58.751]  Good God!
[00:50:59.511 --> 00:51:00.672]  That'll make for good TV.
[00:51:01.092 --> 00:51:01.232]  Ah!
[00:51:02.353 --> 00:51:03.194]  They're attacking!
[00:51:05.135 --> 00:51:05.916]  That'll be interesting.
[00:51:06.096 --> 00:51:07.717]  Man, they had two different feeds connected.
[00:51:07.997 --> 00:51:08.417]  What happened?
[00:51:08.837 --> 00:51:09.818]  Just lost half my hearing.
[00:51:10.479 --> 00:51:12.660]  Kevin, I gotta have you on this to badmouth Pit Bulls.
[00:51:15.442 --> 00:51:16.182]  Did we lose Kevin, then?
[00:51:17.143 --> 00:51:17.543]  Oh, he's over here?
[00:51:17.563 --> 00:51:17.803]  Yeah, Kevin.
[00:51:21.229 --> 00:51:23.591]  I've got to have you on just to bad mouth Pitbulls.
[00:51:24.311 --> 00:51:25.212]  Yeah, no.
[00:51:25.993 --> 00:51:27.274]  Are we still on the internet right now?
[00:51:27.314 --> 00:51:29.415]  Yeah, we're on the internet, but I've got to go for the next show to start.
[00:51:29.855 --> 00:51:31.236]  No, I'll do a whole Pitbull thing.
[00:51:31.297 --> 00:51:34.339]  I used to think it's not the animal's fault, but it is the animal's fault.
[00:51:34.359 --> 00:51:34.919]  Look, here's an example.
[00:51:41.081 --> 00:51:43.922]  Everywhere I go is scum trying to menace me with their dog.
[00:51:43.982 --> 00:51:44.783]  And it doesn't scare me.
[00:51:44.823 --> 00:51:46.663]  I want to physically attack them and their dog.
[00:51:47.164 --> 00:51:54.527]  And then the rest of the time, these people always get a dog and always attacks their niece or attacks the dog or kills the neighbor's cat or kills their own dog.
[00:51:54.787 --> 00:51:56.427]  And then they make excuses for it.
[00:51:56.908 --> 00:51:59.789]  And the fact is, is that it is genetics.
[00:52:00.149 --> 00:52:00.849]  Not all of them.
[00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:02.910]  But it's like Russian roulette.
[00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:09.513]  And I'm just getting tired of these people with their dogs attacking all of us and then making excuses about it.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:25.471]  Well here in California what you have is that people have a pitbull that attacked or killed something or somebody and instead of putting it to sleep they don't have the heart so they take it to one of these rehabilitation shelters and then some unlikely dumbass comes and he adopts it
[00:52:25.959 --> 00:52:29.082]  And that takes it to an off-leash park where it comes and practically kills it.
[00:52:41.596 --> 00:52:41.836]  Yeah.
[00:52:41.996 --> 00:52:43.938]  And then that damn Pitbull almost killed it.
[00:52:44.539 --> 00:52:46.320]  And Pitbull owners will smile!
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.402]  You know, they'll be like, you didn't mean it!
[00:52:48.422 --> 00:52:50.264]  They only do it sometimes!
[00:52:52.366 --> 00:52:53.647]  And it's like, oh, here's a gun!
[00:52:53.687 --> 00:52:54.988]  Shoot you in the face five times!
[00:52:55.409 --> 00:52:57.350]  You know, it's like, oh, it's real funny!
[00:52:58.852 --> 00:53:03.196]  I can't believe this guy said, I've got paperwork that proves he's not violent.
[00:53:06.308 --> 00:53:08.970]  Well, we'll badmouth Pitbulls and get everybody mad at us next week.
[00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.631]  I'll see you, Kevin.
[00:53:09.971 --> 00:53:10.492]  Alright, goodbye.
[00:53:10.712 --> 00:53:11.473]  Vaya con Dios.
[00:53:11.893 --> 00:53:13.094]  Alright, that's it, John.
[00:53:13.795 --> 00:53:14.575]  Good job today.
[00:53:14.615 --> 00:53:15.896]  I'll see you next Monday.
[00:53:15.916 --> 00:53:23.603]  And for everybody else, I'll see you Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., ladies and gentlemen, right here on the one and the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:53:23.883 --> 00:53:24.644]  You take care, Jones.
[00:53:24.844 --> 00:53:25.184]  Bye-bye.
[00:53:25.505 --> 00:53:25.725]  You too.
