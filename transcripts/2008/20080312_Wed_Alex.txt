[00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:06.594]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.255 --> 00:00:08.315]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.016 --> 00:00:10.116]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:11.577]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.337 --> 00:00:13.298]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.898 --> 00:00:17.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.162]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:42.914]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:54.220]  Syracuse University did a big analysis of what the FBI's new duties and jobs are, and it's predominantly just spying on the American people.
[00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:58.463]  No longer is it mainline crime-fighting like bank robbery.
[00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:01.456]  And child kidnapping and things like that.
[00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:02.596]  Well, I understand why.
[00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:08.338]  They'd run into their bosses' businesses too often, and that's caused too big of a problem.
[00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:17.781]  Got to leave the border wide open while running around snooping and creating giant files on any citizen of note, even if you're a grobbler who worships the government.
[00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:20.002]  Say some local neocon preacher.
[00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:22.363]  Big, fat file on you.
[00:01:22.383 --> 00:01:23.263]  You've been surveilled.
[00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:23.923]  You've been watched.
[00:01:23.963 --> 00:01:25.904]  They've got a nice dirt file on you.
[00:01:26.684 --> 00:01:30.326]  Don't think they didn't have a file on Elliot Spetzer.
[00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:40.091]  And don't think that this just accidentally happened because his bank saw something suspicious in the governor's accounts.
[00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:43.312]  Which, again, surveilling you without a warrant right there.
[00:01:43.773 --> 00:01:46.534]  The know-your-customer situation.
[00:01:47.895 --> 00:01:50.616]  Here in the surveillance nation.
[00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:58.235]  But the FBI just can't seem to go bust Dyncor Halliburton for running the giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:12.325]  But coming up in the third hour, for about 20 minutes, we've got one of the directors of the program at Syracuse that collated all this data on what the FBI is really doing today with just statistical analysis and their own admissions.
[00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:15.127]  That, again, is coming up later.
[00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:19.930]  Oil prices are at all-time highs.
[00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:29.338]  Going upwards of $110 a barrel, and you'll be paying well over $4 a gallon on average here in the United States.
[00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:35.421]  In the very near future, many areas are already paying more than that.
[00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:38.382]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:02:39.582 --> 00:02:46.105]  Also, dollar declines on speculation that Fed Rescue Package won't succeed.
[00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:51.473]  So we'll be breaking down that financial news as well.
[00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:54.174]  Gold rises on Fed liquidity boost.
[00:02:56.396 --> 00:03:01.078]  But the Fed's rabbit out of a hat trick is failing, at least on the surface.
[00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:02.479]  Is it really failing?
[00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.380]  What is their true goal?
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.663]  What do they really want to do is the larger question.
[00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:16.688]  Also, we have headlines like this one out of the Associated Press.
[00:03:17.685 --> 00:03:18.285]  We're good to go.
[00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:18.566]  I think?
[00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:47.296]  I think.
[00:04:14.912 --> 00:04:16.553]  We're going to break down this article.
[00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:45.772]  Get into the head of sitcom resigning, the White House spinning it.
[00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:54.898]  In fact, we'll cover that first, then get into this latest vaccine development, and a lot more today.
[00:04:55.578 --> 00:04:59.801]  Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are the two big sites.
[00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:00.782]  Check them out.
[00:05:02.062 --> 00:05:07.226]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future.
[00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.292]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:12.953]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:05:13.134 --> 00:05:16.176]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:19.238]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.978 --> 00:05:27.363]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.325 --> 00:05:35.269]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:36.470]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.410]  They're not after money.
[00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.811]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:40.052]  They're after power.
[00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:41.172]  That's what they have to use.
[00:06:01.172 --> 00:06:04.355]  Yes, there is an in-dash AM-FM shortwave radio.
[00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:12.742]  For limited time and in limited numbers, the Sony GT160S AM-FM shortwave radio and CD player is available only at the Power Hour.
[00:06:13.022 --> 00:06:21.088]  This radio is designed to eliminate interference from ignition systems, and the result is clear, clean reception, so you can hear your favorite broadcasts both domestically and internationally.

[00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.711]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:06:42.731 --> 00:06:44.252]  You can now get the most important package ever.

[00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:20.756]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.
[00:07:21.096 --> 00:07:24.718]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages in other information.

[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.242]  That's Most Holy Family Monastery.

[00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:06.815]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:08.556]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:10.356]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.997 --> 00:08:11.837]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.577 --> 00:08:14.498]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.518 --> 00:08:17.999]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:22.460]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.242 --> 00:08:33.003]  It is already Wednesday, 12th day of March 2008.
[00:08:39.366 --> 00:08:42.468]  I'm going to go ahead and get straight into the news here.
[00:08:43.388 --> 00:09:06.642]  Let's start with Secretary of Defense Mr. Gates, former CIA Director, former head of the University of A&M, of a college station, saying that the Admiral has not resigned over disagreements with President Bush.
[00:09:06.702 --> 00:09:06.842]  Now,
[00:09:09.404 --> 00:09:35.562]  I have scores of quotes here where the Admiral sat down with Esquire, where the Admiral sat down with TV networks, video clips of him disagreeing with the White House, which is unprecedented about attacking Iran, and saying that the majority of the commanders...
[00:09:37.688 --> 00:09:39.849]  Know that it's wrong because it's preemptive.
[00:09:39.969 --> 00:09:50.352]  It is like Hitler attacking Poland or Hitler attacking France or Stalin going into Czechoslovakia.
[00:09:51.312 --> 00:09:52.593]  You don't do that.
[00:09:55.954 --> 00:09:56.874]  Here's a quote from him.
[00:09:57.254 --> 00:10:06.117]  The Joint Chiefs Chairman, Secretary of Defense, almost every senior military officer is against launching military strikes against Iran.
[00:10:08.928 --> 00:10:11.650]  Now, there have been hundreds of senior officers.
[00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:17.814]  By senior, I mean three four-star generals, two-star generals, one-star generals that have quit.
[00:10:18.775 --> 00:10:27.761]  The average stint's about five and a half months for a commander in Baghdad, the sub-directorate head of operations in Iraq.
[00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:38.088]  But this guy was the head of CENTCOM, of the sector covering the Middle East, North Africa, into Eastern Europe,
[00:10:40.043 --> 00:10:43.745]  And out to Pakistan and India, to the borders of China.
[00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:48.748]  And we've got all those quotes here.
[00:10:48.788 --> 00:10:49.969]  You can go find them anywhere you wish.
[00:10:50.009 --> 00:10:51.189]  You can read the Esquire story.
[00:10:51.229 --> 00:11:01.215]  The man between war and peace was the story that basically... Well, it's come out the White House really never fires anybody.
[00:11:01.235 --> 00:11:02.756]  They just order you to resign.
[00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.418]  And he had another year in his command...
[00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:14.984]  And by the time they're done with it, they'll probably call him a commie or something on the Rush Limbaugh.
[00:11:15.525 --> 00:11:16.685]  But tell us Hillary's good.
[00:11:16.725 --> 00:11:17.646]  You know, that's how it works.
[00:11:18.747 --> 00:11:25.351]  Bunch of chicken hawks and everything been in combat like Fox Fallon, William Fox Fallon.
[00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:30.674]  But let's go ahead and just play the CIA spook.
[00:11:33.876 --> 00:11:34.256]  Lying.
[00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:35.217]  How do you know he's lying?
[00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:36.237]  Well, the lips are moving.
[00:11:36.277 --> 00:11:36.598]  Here it is.
[00:11:37.718 --> 00:11:38.759]  Admiral William Fallon.
[00:11:39.329 --> 00:11:48.131]  The current embarrassing situation, public perception of differences between my views and administration policy, and the distraction this causes from the mission make this the right thing to do.
[00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:15.771]  I have approved Admiral Fallon's request to retire with reluctance and regret.
[00:12:17.212 --> 00:12:22.375]  Effective March 31st, Lieutenant General Martin Dempsey, Deputy Commander of U.S.
[00:12:22.415 --> 00:12:25.516]  Central Command, will serve as Acting Commander.
[00:12:26.337 --> 00:12:32.620]  He will serve in that capacity until such time as permanent relief can be nominated and confirmed.
[00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:38.523]  Admiral Fallon has served his nation well throughout a distinguished military career,
[00:12:39.588 --> 00:12:56.637]  For over 40 years, first in the Navy and then at the helm of two of the most important and dynamic operational commands, Pacific and Central Command, Fox Fallon has led our nation and hundreds of thousands of men and women in uniform with conviction, strategic vision, integrity, and courage.
[00:12:57.898 --> 00:13:06.523]  Admiral Fallon fought bravely in the skies over Vietnam, commanded an air wing during Desert Storm, and then went on to lead at the highest levels of U.S.
[00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:07.203]  Armed Forces.
[00:13:08.635 --> 00:13:21.499]  As commander of CENTCOM, he has managed with skill and diplomacy the mounting challenges across the broader Middle East, and has kept foremost in mind the need to protect our vital national security interests in the region.
[00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:31.702]  Fox Fallon has dedicated his life to the preservation of the freedoms we in this nation enjoy today, and all Americans should be deeply grateful for his dedication.
[00:13:32.762 --> 00:13:37.764]  On behalf of the Department of Defense and the nation, I thank him for his years of selfless service.
[00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.355]  Admiral Fallon reached this difficult decision entirely on his own.
[00:13:43.316 --> 00:13:52.409]  I believe it was the right thing to do, even though I do not believe there are in fact significant differences between his views and administration policy.
[00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:54.392]  I'll take a few questions.
[00:13:56.501 --> 00:14:03.103]  Is there any truth to the portrayal of Fallon as somebody who was trying to keep this country out of war with Iran?
[00:14:05.024 --> 00:14:11.206]  That he was the one arguing against the administration that was eager to go to war with Iran to stop that?
[00:14:11.686 --> 00:14:15.688]  No, I think that's one of the misperceptions that Admiral Fallon was referring to.
[00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:16.708]  The fact is that...
[00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:27.504]  Administration policy is to try and deal with the Iranian challenge through diplomatic and economic pressures and sanctions, and Fox obviously was fully supportive of that.
[00:14:27.844 --> 00:14:35.790]  There was a line in that Esquire story that said that basically if Fallon gets fired, it means we're going to war with Iran.
[00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.391]  Can you just address that?
[00:14:37.852 --> 00:14:39.193]  Well, it's just ridiculous.
[00:14:40.874 --> 00:14:41.635]  It's ridiculous.
[00:14:41.735 --> 00:14:42.715]  Last question.
[00:14:42.956 --> 00:14:43.396]  Last question.
[00:14:43.939 --> 00:14:47.800]  You said in your opening statement that this was an embarrassing situation.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.021]  Admiral Fallon said it was an embarrassing situation.
[00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:56.183]  Doesn't that Esquire article and that one line open you up for even more criticism?
[00:14:56.864 --> 00:15:01.725]  The notion that this does signal an opening for war?
[00:15:01.805 --> 00:15:07.427]  Well, I am presented with dealing with Admiral Fallon's decision.
[00:15:08.728 --> 00:15:11.169]  And as I say, I think it's the right decision.
[00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:23.662]  As I say, the notion that this decision portends anything in terms of a change in Iran policy is, to quote myself, ridiculous.
[00:15:24.963 --> 00:15:25.303]  Thank you.
[00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:28.766]  That's incredible.
[00:15:28.926 --> 00:15:33.750]  I'm not going to play it again, but it's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com if you want to go watch it.
[00:15:35.011 --> 00:15:37.894]  Or it's also posted on ABC News Story, Top U.S.
[00:15:37.914 --> 00:15:39.215]  Commander in Middle East Resigns.
[00:15:39.235 --> 00:15:40.095]  You can find a clip there.
[00:15:40.476 --> 00:15:41.797]  Same clip, same statement.
[00:15:44.306 --> 00:15:48.947]  Did you hear him say, William Fox Fallon is resigning.
[00:15:49.007 --> 00:15:49.907]  I don't agree with it.
[00:15:49.947 --> 00:15:51.487]  I don't like it, but I will accept it.
[00:15:52.247 --> 00:15:55.168]  And at the end of his statement, he says, I do agree with it.
[00:15:55.608 --> 00:15:56.968]  I do think it's the right thing to do.
[00:15:56.988 --> 00:16:01.009]  I mean, they can't even write lying statements.
[00:16:02.009 --> 00:16:07.710]  That's a two and a half minute statement, and they can't even... The lies.
[00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.671]  Do they lie so much that they can't even lie good anymore?
[00:16:15.757 --> 00:16:17.638]  He says, I don't think it's good that he's resigning.
[00:16:17.678 --> 00:16:18.879]  I don't agree with him resigning.
[00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:19.919]  We don't want him to resign.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.922]  And then later, he says, I think it's good he's resigning.
[00:16:25.962 --> 00:16:26.983]  I agree with the decision.
[00:16:30.725 --> 00:16:35.747]  And you notice he doesn't come right out and say, you know, Fallon didn't disagree with the war.
[00:16:36.487 --> 00:16:38.849]  He just says, well, it's the right thing to do that he's gone now.
[00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:43.011]  And it's just absolutely ridiculous that he was against the war, basically is what he's saying.
[00:16:43.911 --> 00:16:45.412]  Or that, you know, this means we're going to war.
[00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:54.052]  They just keep putting more and more commanders in, and they just keep refusing.
[00:16:56.353 --> 00:16:59.394]  Because Iran, I mean, imagine what Fallon knows.
[00:17:01.015 --> 00:17:17.701]  Fallon knows that the CIA, for almost four years, has spent several billion dollars that is declassified with Wahhabist al-Qaeda, number three al-Qaeda running the operation, that's a mainstream White House press release,
[00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:23.948]  A year ago, but it's been in the New Yorker magazine and other places for almost four years, here for four years.
[00:17:25.129 --> 00:17:33.553]  Special ops running all over the country, but mainly on the western border of Iran with the eastern border of Iraq.
[00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:48.119]  Wahhabist, Sunni, hardcore, backed, of course, by the archenemy of Iran, Saudi Arabia, the globalist arch-buddy, attacks
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:56.665]  Bombing dams, shooting police, blowing up school buses, same thing they did to the Serbs, our government using Wahhabist Muslims, when the Serbs fought back.
[00:17:56.705 --> 00:17:57.566]  How dare you, though?
[00:17:57.826 --> 00:17:59.207]  We're going to kill you all now.
[00:17:59.567 --> 00:18:01.909]  I mean, and the public can't find the U.S.
[00:18:01.969 --> 00:18:02.769]  on a map, literally.
[00:18:03.069 --> 00:18:04.030]  They can't find China.
[00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.231]  They don't know what geopolitical even means.
[00:18:06.952 --> 00:18:09.233]  They don't know what a dollar devaluation means.
[00:18:09.253 --> 00:18:11.435]  I mean, you realize your neighbor, on average, doesn't know this?
[00:18:11.975 --> 00:18:14.937]  And so they just hear, Iran is backing Al-Qaeda.
[00:18:15.825 --> 00:18:19.826]  And I know I say this, I talk about it a lot, but we need to make this point to everybody, write articles about it.
[00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:21.206]  Listeners need to.
[00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:22.587]  This is a big issue.
[00:18:23.587 --> 00:18:27.928]  Because for anybody in the intelligentsia, and intelligentsia means you can tie your shoelaces now.
[00:18:28.668 --> 00:18:33.070]  We're dumbed down so bad that if you can tie your shoelaces, you're basically like a genius level now.
[00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:36.730]  I'm being a little sarcastic.
[00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.871]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:18:38.111 --> 00:18:38.731]  I just can't.
[00:18:39.531 --> 00:18:41.091]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[00:18:41.691 --> 00:18:47.533]  Our government is so evil and so obviously in the wrong on every front in spades.
[00:18:51.093 --> 00:19:00.075]  Imagine, Iran sits there and takes it while insurgents are funded by the criminals that run our government who are Wahhabist Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:02.076 --> 00:19:08.637]  And then the media says Iran is Al-Qaeda when they are Shiite-run arch-enemies
[00:19:09.765 --> 00:19:10.425]  Of Al Qaeda.
[00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:16.067]  And I'm not saying all Sunnis are Wahhabist Al Qaeda.
[00:19:16.087 --> 00:19:18.267]  The point is, it is Wahhabist Al Qaeda that's doing it.
[00:19:18.727 --> 00:19:21.388]  I'm not getting into a Shiite versus Sunni thing.
[00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:27.549]  The point is, the public better learn about all this.
[00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.790]  You better learn the terms.
[00:19:30.646 --> 00:19:35.249]  It isn't about walking around by your big truck strutting around going, I'm pro-war!
[00:19:35.469 --> 00:19:36.810]  Yeah, boy!
[00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.731]  Yeah, America!
[00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:43.594]  You know, going to the Marine Corps recruiting station and showing off how many pull-ups you can do.
[00:19:44.234 --> 00:19:47.836]  It's about having a brain and knowing who the players are.
[00:19:48.256 --> 00:19:50.397]  You've made a decision about this, neocons?
[00:19:50.758 --> 00:19:51.278]  Followers?
[00:19:52.879 --> 00:19:54.240]  But you don't even know the players?
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.082]  We'll come back more on Fox Fowl and...
[00:20:03.021 --> 00:20:05.082]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.703 --> 00:20:14.628]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:15.108 --> 00:20:22.272]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.995 --> 00:20:26.858]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMed, Inc.'
[00:20:26.838 --> 00:20:28.479]  's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:39.788]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.569 --> 00:20:42.630]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.041]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:58.441 --> 00:21:03.706]  It is a big idea.
[00:21:04.746 --> 00:21:05.807]  A new world order.
[00:21:06.508 --> 00:21:10.691]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:10.711 --> 00:21:13.153]  It's known as the builder of Earth.
[00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:16.396]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:17.017 --> 00:21:19.459]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:27.506]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:30.531 --> 00:21:35.512]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.992 --> 00:21:39.453]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.853 --> 00:21:42.353]  Build-A-Bear is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:42.413 --> 00:21:43.393]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.413 --> 00:21:44.353]  They're not after money.
[00:21:44.373 --> 00:21:45.434]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.634 --> 00:21:46.354]  They're after power.
[00:21:46.614 --> 00:21:47.734]  That's what I have to do.
[00:21:47.774 --> 00:21:55.955]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.

[00:21:59.256 --> 00:22:00.437]  You have been warned.
[00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:23.400]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:29.722]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:22:29.942 --> 00:22:33.484]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:22:33.744 --> 00:22:38.286]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:22:38.566 --> 00:22:39.346]  Do your part.
[00:22:39.606 --> 00:22:41.867]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.

[00:23:10.762 --> 00:23:12.163]  America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:23:12.523 --> 00:23:19.366]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:27.790]  We're good to go.
[00:23:58.111 --> 00:24:03.734]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Ellis Spitzer has resigned.
[00:24:03.754 --> 00:24:07.156]  Former New York Attorney General going after corruption.
[00:24:07.217 --> 00:24:08.778]  He's now resigned as governor.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.702]  And last night I was just thinking about it.
[00:24:29.964 --> 00:24:34.228]  Barney Frank, the congressman from Maryland.
[00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:44.057]  Well, up in Maryland is where he had his three-story townhouse filled with underage.
[00:24:44.117 --> 00:24:47.100]  Now, they were 15, 16, but still it's bad.
[00:24:49.763 --> 00:24:50.944]  Homosexual brothel.
[00:24:55.121 --> 00:24:57.882]  And when they were going to bust him, he came out to a press conference.
[00:24:57.902 --> 00:25:04.826]  He said, listen, this stops now, or I'm going to start naming names, and the government's going to come down.
[00:25:04.846 --> 00:25:05.806]  We've got to find that clip.
[00:25:05.826 --> 00:25:07.647]  That happened like 10, 12 years ago.
[00:25:07.667 --> 00:25:10.909]  I remember seeing it on the news, and it just ended.
[00:25:10.989 --> 00:25:14.350]  The media just shut down, didn't report on it, and he was left alone.
[00:25:18.812 --> 00:25:20.073]  Now, that's underage...
[00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:21.630]  Juveniles.
[00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:23.211]  I mean, he should go to prison for that.
[00:25:24.491 --> 00:25:28.212]  Much less prostitution, but it's the juvenile nature of it.
[00:25:30.012 --> 00:25:32.993]  Very horrible, very corrupt, very evil.
[00:25:34.554 --> 00:25:35.714]  Feeding on our young people.
[00:25:36.274 --> 00:25:37.094]  Nothing happens.
[00:25:38.735 --> 00:25:45.096]  And you've got Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, and you've got just all the other cases.
[00:25:45.616 --> 00:25:47.457]  Hundreds of times that Jeff Gannon...
[00:25:48.562 --> 00:25:51.303]  The news reporter that Fox News would always go to?
[00:25:51.323 --> 00:25:55.984]  Known gay porn star running a brothel?
[00:25:57.725 --> 00:25:59.305]  Running a bunch of Johns under him?
[00:26:01.086 --> 00:26:01.386]  I don't know.
[00:26:01.406 --> 00:26:02.766]  What do you call a male prostitute?
[00:26:02.786 --> 00:26:04.327]  I guess the Johns, the person that goes to them.
[00:26:04.347 --> 00:26:06.988]  I guess the people in the White House are the Johns.
[00:26:07.008 --> 00:26:07.808]  I don't know what you call them.
[00:26:11.109 --> 00:26:11.889]  Whore dogs?
[00:26:12.589 --> 00:26:14.130]  I think I've heard that term for a male prostitute.
[00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.530]  A gigolo?
[00:26:16.468 --> 00:26:18.328]  But that's a male for female.
[00:26:18.949 --> 00:26:19.329]  I don't know.
[00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:20.129]  Somebody educate me.
[00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:28.891]  The point is that he's in there hundreds and hundreds of times bringing hundreds of others.
[00:26:28.951 --> 00:26:33.332]  It's like over 5,000 visits by him and others after midnight.
[00:26:35.932 --> 00:26:36.452]  Males.
[00:26:39.753 --> 00:26:40.733]  For gay sex.
[00:26:42.254 --> 00:26:43.074]  Not a problem.
[00:26:43.554 --> 00:26:44.354]  Story shut down.
[00:26:45.765 --> 00:26:58.853]  But Elliot Spitzer is having multiple liaisons with a, quote, high-class, high-end escort service.
[00:26:58.873 --> 00:27:01.955]  I mean, those things are everywhere.
[00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:03.236]  Those things are basically legal.
[00:27:03.276 --> 00:27:05.417]  They are legal in several states like Nevada.
[00:27:05.897 --> 00:27:06.558]  They're left alone.
[00:27:06.578 --> 00:27:07.658]  It's up to what the girls do.
[00:27:07.678 --> 00:27:08.979]  I mean, I'm not defending any of it.
[00:27:09.339 --> 00:27:10.780]  It's all part of this decadent society.
[00:27:11.181 --> 00:27:13.242]  The point is, compared to underage...
[00:27:16.062 --> 00:27:39.140]  Boys, in Maryland with Barney Frank and compared to all the other stuff that I just listed, I am just dumbfounded that, oh, it said in the CNN piece I was reading last night, oh, his bank saw him transfer $15,000 into his other account and they report on anything over $10,000.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.381]  And that's true.
[00:27:41.441 --> 00:27:41.922]  Every time
[00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:49.443]  I sell a car, or I pay somebody for music, and I pay right at about $10,000 for the music I've used in the last two films.
[00:27:49.823 --> 00:27:50.904]  It's all reported to the government.
[00:27:51.324 --> 00:27:54.125]  The government goes and looks at Alex Jones in a free country.
[00:27:55.866 --> 00:28:00.147]  It's all supposedly for terrorism, but see, then they use it for Elliot Spitzer and a prostitute.
[00:28:01.087 --> 00:28:05.329]  But just all of your legal, lawful, it's still guilty until proven innocent.
[00:28:07.358 --> 00:28:18.444]  If somebody pays me $10,000 for a car I sell, I think I sold a car for like $12,000 a couple years ago to somebody, I deposit that check, doesn't matter, government goes and looks at it.
[00:28:19.265 --> 00:28:27.789]  Elliot Spitzer, though, $15,000 to pay for these different liaisons, a string of liaisons, and they gave that to the FBI.
[00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:34.533]  But the FBI, quote, was already investigating the prostitution ring.
[00:28:35.436 --> 00:28:40.939]  What are they doing investigating a high-end, on average, 30-year-old supermodel?
[00:28:40.979 --> 00:28:41.859]  That's who these people are.
[00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:44.620]  Models during the day, prostitutes in New York at night.
[00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:58.307]  What are they doing when there are rocket attacks, 50-plus Americans kidnapped in one day alone, car bombs going off, Mexican mafia burning American citizens' children with gasoline?
[00:28:58.327 --> 00:29:01.108]  We had the Washington Times reporter on last week in front of them.
[00:29:01.923 --> 00:29:04.785]  Dinecore kidnapping children for sex slave rings.
[00:29:05.345 --> 00:29:07.406]  I'm talking two-year-olds in Saudi Arabia.
[00:29:08.827 --> 00:29:10.088]  All of this in the BBC.
[00:29:10.308 --> 00:29:11.168]  Names listed.
[00:29:11.248 --> 00:29:12.309]  No one gets in trouble.
[00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.030]  Chicago Tribune.
[00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.971]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:29:17.772 --> 00:29:20.653]  And Elliot Spitzer for being with some 30-year-old women.
[00:29:21.854 --> 00:29:23.595]  And I'm not defending Elliot Spitzer.
[00:29:23.935 --> 00:29:25.436]  Mr. Goody Two Shoes.
[00:29:26.156 --> 00:29:27.897]  But that's what his lawyer, Dershowitz, is saying.
[00:29:28.258 --> 00:29:30.659]  Or his former law professor is saying, well...
[00:29:31.528 --> 00:29:33.410]  He could still be anti-corruption.
[00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:34.050]  He was.
[00:29:35.171 --> 00:29:37.733]  And then, you know, he was against crimes that hurt people.
[00:29:38.413 --> 00:29:39.954]  This isn't hurting anybody.
[00:29:41.275 --> 00:29:45.118]  Well, you can argue it does hurt the society, but... Yeah, don't worry.
[00:29:45.138 --> 00:29:50.382]  The FBI's out after 30-year-old supermodel prostitutes, but the border's wide open.
[00:29:52.204 --> 00:29:53.124]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.605 --> 00:29:55.206]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.147 --> 00:29:58.829]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.361 --> 00:30:03.542]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:30:03.642 --> 00:30:05.903]  on the Nutri-Medical Report here on Genesis.
[00:30:06.043 --> 00:30:09.024]  Allicin's natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:30:09.084 --> 00:30:09.785]  is a real thing.
[00:30:09.845 --> 00:30:16.728]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, if never before available, garlic.
[00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:27.733]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills flesh-eating bacteria, MRSA, and acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[00:30:27.873 --> 00:30:31.115]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of
[00:30:31.275 --> 00:30:31.855]  We're good to go.
[00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:03.587]  Government is best which governs least.
[00:31:03.767 --> 00:31:05.207]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:31:05.307 --> 00:31:08.249]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:31:08.369 --> 00:31:11.230]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.131]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.
[00:31:14.631 --> 00:31:21.094]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.185]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:32:03.525 --> 00:32:09.034]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:32:09.515 --> 00:32:13.081]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened.
[00:32:13.481 --> 00:32:14.002]  What happened?
[00:32:14.329 --> 00:32:14.829]  We're good to go.
[00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:37.271]  The last word monastery spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[00:32:37.611 --> 00:32:38.091]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[00:32:38.111 --> 00:32:38.311]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[00:32:38.331 --> 00:32:41.092]  Or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, New York 14735.
[00:32:41.493 --> 00:32:45.194]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:32:45.514 --> 00:32:46.715]  $15 for UPS Ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:33:01.694 --> 00:33:03.535]  All right, my friends.
[00:33:03.615 --> 00:33:10.997]  We're going to open the phones up in the next segment to talk about William Fox Fallon.
[00:33:31.264 --> 00:33:32.965]  Former head of CENTCOM designing.
[00:33:34.686 --> 00:33:37.388]  Clearly over the fact that he doesn't believe we should attack Iran.
[00:33:37.428 --> 00:33:38.028]  That's admitted.
[00:33:39.709 --> 00:33:43.892]  Also, we can talk about the hypocrisy.
[00:33:43.952 --> 00:33:46.193]  I mean, this government is so evil, so corrupt.
[00:33:48.055 --> 00:33:51.977]  You can have hundreds of male prostitutes in there visiting the White House.
[00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:54.358]  That's probably why Spitzer's in trouble.
[00:33:54.459 --> 00:33:54.859]  If it was a...
[00:33:55.771 --> 00:33:57.411]  Another Republican gay scandal.
[00:33:57.431 --> 00:33:59.592]  They probably couldn't handle that, and they would have told the FBI to back off.
[00:34:00.052 --> 00:34:01.853]  But this is all selectively enforced.
[00:34:02.233 --> 00:34:04.413]  If we can talk about that, I've got a bunch of economic news.
[00:34:05.334 --> 00:34:18.197]  In Europe, they want to arrest parents if they don't inject their children with cancer-filled shots, and they admit this particular vaccine has the HV40 in it.
[00:34:19.577 --> 00:34:21.478]  So we're going to be going over that as well.
[00:34:23.135 --> 00:34:34.982]  1-800-259-9231 I got some calls yesterday that this fella had been trying to get a hold of me and was calling another radio show discussing a story.
[00:34:35.342 --> 00:34:36.103]  So I got his number.
[00:34:36.123 --> 00:34:37.984]  I did some research last night and this morning.
[00:34:38.444 --> 00:34:39.285]  Here's the headline.
[00:34:39.345 --> 00:34:40.105]  News with views.
[00:34:40.145 --> 00:34:40.845]  This did happen.
[00:34:41.426 --> 00:34:43.327]  Cop arrests man over silver coin.
[00:34:43.347 --> 00:34:44.948]  This is not the first time this has happened.
[00:34:45.948 --> 00:34:50.551]  Derby, New York businessman was arrested over this.
[00:34:51.863 --> 00:34:53.284]  And that's Dan Buczek.
[00:34:53.304 --> 00:34:56.806]  We have his son, Shane Buczek, on the line.
[00:34:58.587 --> 00:35:05.392]  And we don't have a lot of time, but I do want to get this story out there, because this is par for the course.
[00:35:05.832 --> 00:35:07.713]  The paranoia, the insanity.
[00:35:08.274 --> 00:35:20.522]  I've seen multiple stories where people try to pay with a $2 bill at Best Buy and other places, and ten different employees come over, three cops, the person's polite, they still arrest you,
[00:35:21.596 --> 00:35:24.597]  They take you to jail for legal tender, $2 U.S.
[00:35:24.657 --> 00:35:24.837]  note.
[00:35:24.877 --> 00:35:27.537]  It's got the Declaration of Independence signing on the back.
[00:35:27.557 --> 00:35:29.918]  For those who don't know, I've got quite a few of them.
[00:35:29.938 --> 00:35:31.138]  My dad gave them to me when I was a kid.
[00:35:32.859 --> 00:35:34.679]  But there's still quite a few in circulation.
[00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:36.519]  That's how dumb the public is.
[00:35:36.939 --> 00:35:38.240]  And they're looking for Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.280]  They're looking for threats.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.801]  They've been told, leave the open borders of illegal aliens, real criminals alone.
[00:35:44.861 --> 00:35:46.362]  Everything's selectively enforced.
[00:35:46.622 --> 00:35:48.222]  And so there's just this paranoia that,
[00:35:48.934 --> 00:35:55.658]  And the law enforcement training manuals say those that talk about the Constitution, those that talk about liberty or terrorists, we have their training manuals.
[00:35:57.519 --> 00:36:01.401]  And you've got the Liberty Dollar people that got raided.
[00:36:01.742 --> 00:36:03.903]  I've got some Liberty Dollars, beautiful silver coins.
[00:36:04.923 --> 00:36:05.864]  I've got Ron Paul ones.
[00:36:05.904 --> 00:36:09.546]  I've got them from back in 99 when I got some that just have the Statue of Liberty on them.
[00:36:10.327 --> 00:36:17.451]  There are hundreds of companies, Kitco, I mean the list goes on and on, who issue their own silver coins.
[00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:24.378]  And if in barter you can get somebody to accept that, then that's a good deal.
[00:36:25.179 --> 00:36:29.423]  But just for trying to barter, I had a friend, Chris Athanas, at UT.
[00:36:29.503 --> 00:36:41.693]  He was just showing someone on the street a silver dollar, and the police came over and said that's counterfeit and arrested him for having the silver coin.
[00:36:41.733 --> 00:36:46.057]  I mean, again, the public is so stupid now.
[00:36:47.094 --> 00:36:52.097]  They literally just... It's just unbelievable, folks.
[00:36:52.798 --> 00:36:53.378]  We're goners.
[00:36:53.518 --> 00:36:54.539]  I mean, you've got to understand that.
[00:36:54.899 --> 00:37:04.024]  If we can't get these cattle to even learn and understand anything, they're just running around, looking for people to tattle on, freaking out in fear, 24 hours a day.
[00:37:05.685 --> 00:37:06.586]  So this happened.
[00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:10.708]  And then they were going across the Canadian border and had Ron Paul stickers, so they flipped out on them.
[00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:16.612]  Just like you saw on the news last week with the separate case with the cherry bombing of the...
[00:37:17.992 --> 00:37:20.734]  Probably by the feds of the recruiting station in Times Square.
[00:37:21.114 --> 00:37:24.637]  You know, they said, oh, we pulled over people that had Liberty stuff in their cars.
[00:37:24.697 --> 00:37:25.637]  It's probably related.
[00:37:26.478 --> 00:37:28.499]  I mean, this is a hysteria.
[00:37:31.181 --> 00:37:32.242]  Another mass hoax.
[00:37:32.682 --> 00:37:35.204]  So just spending a few minutes with them so we understand the case.
[00:37:35.624 --> 00:37:40.307]  We've got Shane and we've got his father, Dan Buczek.
[00:37:42.108 --> 00:37:44.510]  Just in a nutshell, let's go to Shane first.
[00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:45.829]  The Sun.
[00:37:46.429 --> 00:37:49.490]  In a nutshell, just boil down exactly what's happened.
[00:37:51.131 --> 00:37:54.171]  Well, Alex, I crossed the border on Super Bowl night.
[00:37:54.251 --> 00:37:59.233]  Actually, I was racing home from a Ron Paul meetup and a 9-1-1 Truth meetup up in Toronto.
[00:37:59.253 --> 00:38:00.893]  There's back-to-back meetups up there.
[00:38:01.573 --> 00:38:04.174]  And it was Super Bowl Sunday, and I traded the exact same thing.
[00:38:04.234 --> 00:38:05.234]  I was crossing the border.
[00:38:05.254 --> 00:38:08.515]  The Canadians gave me no problem every time I'd go over there.
[00:38:08.535 --> 00:38:11.836]  Back to my side of the fence, as soon as I crossed over...
[00:38:12.706 --> 00:38:14.848]  My hand and my identification, which is my U.S.
[00:38:14.868 --> 00:38:15.328]  passport.
[00:38:15.348 --> 00:38:17.790]  And he looked in the back of the car and he goes, what is that?
[00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:22.233]  And I had a beautiful big white sign that said Ron Paul Revolution.
[00:38:23.273 --> 00:38:25.915]  And to make a long story short, he started questioning me about all that.
[00:38:25.955 --> 00:38:27.196]  Then he goes, well, open up your trunk.
[00:38:27.496 --> 00:38:31.939]  And then within 30 seconds, I was surrounded by 10 guys, the Border Patrol.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.843]  They took me in, went through my whole car, and I was there for about two hours.
[00:38:37.863 --> 00:38:39.604]  I missed the most the entire Super Bowl game.
[00:38:40.425 --> 00:38:40.705]  And then...
[00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:45.893]  Eventually, one of the investigators from the Border Patrol came down.
[00:38:46.974 --> 00:38:47.774]  He was on call.
[00:38:48.215 --> 00:38:51.437]  He spent no more than five minutes with me, and he says, all right, listen, sorry we made a mistake.
[00:38:51.477 --> 00:38:52.078]  Have a nice day.
[00:38:53.099 --> 00:39:10.953]  And then, lo and behold, I jumped on a plane three days later and came up to California to work with my brother out in San Jose, California, and just recently, it took him six weeks, they raided my parents' house, and my dad can give you that side of the story, but what they're doing is that
[00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:21.339]  Do you think this is related to the cherry bomb, or did they raid you before the cherry bomb that made international news and international panic and fear?
[00:39:22.999 --> 00:39:24.700]  I think all of the above, Alex.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:30.161]  But I'm asking you, did they raid your parents before or after last week's cherry bomb?
[00:39:31.941 --> 00:39:32.682]  I believe it was after.
[00:39:33.642 --> 00:39:35.442]  So when did they raid your parents, this last week?
[00:39:36.502 --> 00:39:39.203]  It was Thursday, yeah, just Thursday.
[00:39:39.775 --> 00:39:41.536]  Thursday of last week.
[00:39:41.556 --> 00:39:58.789]  Yeah, well, I believe they're talking about you in the news, where they put out the big national alert saying, we found people with anti-government literature coming back in from Canada, you know, scramble the Air Force, the Marines, the Army, everything, it's over.
[00:39:59.269 --> 00:40:02.371]  And, of course, you know they arrest people for Ron Paul signs in public now.
[00:40:02.672 --> 00:40:03.572]  That's been in the news.
[00:40:03.973 --> 00:40:07.295]  They've been taught that free speech is illegal and evil.
[00:40:07.947 --> 00:40:09.689]  And so they're cultically going around.
[00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:16.097]  Let's bring your dad up, who, by the way, has been in trouble before, for evil silver dollars.
[00:40:16.437 --> 00:40:19.521]  Again, and there's evil $2 bills, too.
[00:40:19.601 --> 00:40:20.302]  Everyone's evil.
[00:40:20.963 --> 00:40:24.067]  Again, Los Zetas is having car bombs in Texas.
[00:40:24.587 --> 00:40:25.268]  Hundreds dead.
[00:40:25.328 --> 00:40:26.129]  Rocket attacks.
[00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.391]  Will not be in the news.
[00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:30.032]  Just total crime everywhere.
[00:40:30.133 --> 00:40:31.513]  Organized crime taking over.
[00:40:32.353 --> 00:40:33.213]  Lawlessness.
[00:40:33.233 --> 00:40:34.313]  The dollar imploding.
[00:40:35.094 --> 00:40:36.294]  Criminals running the government.
[00:40:37.074 --> 00:40:39.635]  Thousands of visits by mail madams to the White House.
[00:40:39.675 --> 00:40:40.315]  That's fine.
[00:40:40.795 --> 00:40:42.235]  But just total hysteria.
[00:40:42.315 --> 00:40:43.476]  You've got silver dollars.
[00:40:43.996 --> 00:40:46.536]  I mean, you guys just keep having run-ins with Big Brother, don't you?
[00:40:47.137 --> 00:40:47.917]  Let's go to Dan.
[00:40:48.337 --> 00:40:51.398]  Dan, you're the evil patriarch of this family.
[00:40:52.058 --> 00:40:53.458]  First, tell me about the evil coins.
[00:40:54.858 --> 00:40:55.859]  The evil coins.
[00:40:55.959 --> 00:40:57.219]  Well, very simply...
[00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.772]  They were used at a hockey game.
[00:41:01.693 --> 00:41:07.277]  And they wanted to arrest my daughter and my two other younger boys for using them.
[00:41:07.317 --> 00:41:09.899]  And they didn't cause any harm.
[00:41:09.919 --> 00:41:13.242]  They thought they were, you know, just like silver dollars you would use.
[00:41:14.122 --> 00:41:15.684]  And so they didn't use them.
[00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:20.928]  And someone came along and tried to arrest or at least question my daughter.
[00:41:20.948 --> 00:41:23.430]  And I asked him, can you question me?
[00:41:24.531 --> 00:41:25.612]  And before you knew it...
[00:41:27.173 --> 00:41:32.381]  In the time span that we were together at the hockey game with this officer, he put Shane and I in jail.
[00:41:33.683 --> 00:41:34.765]  Well, here's an example.
[00:41:34.845 --> 00:41:36.288]  I went to the rodeo last week.
[00:41:36.328 --> 00:41:37.650]  I never go out to events.
[00:41:38.111 --> 00:41:39.493]  To see Willie Nelson, it was great.
[00:41:40.462 --> 00:41:42.423]  But there are hundreds of cameras.
[00:41:42.463 --> 00:41:48.728]  I mean, when the lights were off, when they turned them down for a part during the rodeo, you'd just see hundreds of lights flashing.
[00:41:48.748 --> 00:41:50.289]  During Willie Nelson, hundreds flashing.
[00:41:50.649 --> 00:41:51.650]  Cameras all around.
[00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:55.913]  But this guy walks up, and I'm walking to get some drinks, and he says, You're Alex Jones.
[00:41:56.153 --> 00:41:56.733]  I'm a fan.
[00:41:57.574 --> 00:41:58.354]  But then he really was.
[00:41:58.414 --> 00:41:59.315]  He was looking at me.
[00:41:59.375 --> 00:42:00.256]  Suddenly, they were looking at us.
[00:42:00.696 --> 00:42:05.539]  About an hour later, my son's got a still camera, but it's also got a video function.
[00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:06.420]  He's taking pictures.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.821]  He likes to play with the camera.
[00:42:08.533 --> 00:42:09.313]  We're good to go.
[00:42:09.373 --> 00:42:09.974]  We're good to go.
[00:42:31.406 --> 00:42:33.428]  And I'm going, I go, look, I'm going to sue you all.
[00:42:33.448 --> 00:42:34.950]  I know you think you're in control.
[00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:36.131]  You can beat the rep.
[00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:36.812]  You can't beat the ride.
[00:42:36.832 --> 00:42:38.213]  I know you're getting ready to do something here.
[00:42:38.233 --> 00:42:39.835]  I just said, go ahead and do what you're going to do.
[00:42:40.155 --> 00:42:41.077]  You're in the driver's seat.
[00:42:41.357 --> 00:42:42.158]  It's your lawsuit.
[00:42:42.578 --> 00:42:44.379]  And then they said, oh, nope, that's it, we're out of here.
[00:42:44.599 --> 00:42:48.001]  And they told the little freak-out security guards that they weren't going to do anything.
[00:42:48.481 --> 00:42:52.843]  I had to literally let them know, and they had to psychically know that I really was going to sue them.
[00:42:52.923 --> 00:42:53.483]  I mean, they knew.
[00:42:53.503 --> 00:42:55.224]  I mean, hey, go ahead, you're going to win.
[00:42:55.244 --> 00:42:56.264]  Go ahead and take me to jail.
[00:42:56.544 --> 00:42:57.705]  Let's go ahead, and I'm going to sue you.
[00:42:58.045 --> 00:42:58.725]  Because this is crazy.
[00:42:58.765 --> 00:43:01.046]  I go, there's a camera there, a camera there, a camera there.
[00:43:01.066 --> 00:43:03.407]  I was pointing out cameras, and they left me alone.
[00:43:03.427 --> 00:43:04.068]  But that's the point.
[00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:21.252]  Just... Because, see, there's all this fear of Al-Qaeda and everything else, but there's no real crime, so it's just frothing and freaking out and spying and sneaking and tattling and creeping and looking over your back fence and just tattletales everywhere.
[00:43:21.532 --> 00:43:24.872]  So they took you to jail for the evil silver coins?
[00:43:26.073 --> 00:43:26.253]  Yes.
[00:43:28.993 --> 00:43:32.014]  And for the past two years we've been...
[00:43:33.388 --> 00:43:36.991]  Dealing with this particular incident, going to court over 30 times.
[00:43:38.312 --> 00:43:41.454]  And I was even put in jail for about 10 days.
[00:43:42.515 --> 00:43:44.976]  I gave him a little scale with a writ of habeas corpus.
[00:43:46.337 --> 00:43:49.700]  And we're still working on our appeal.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.141]  It's in the court system.
[00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:55.964]  To be heard and answered, I think, by March 18th.
[00:43:56.044 --> 00:43:59.367]  Now, what are they charging you with, trying to pass counterfeit currency?
[00:44:00.007 --> 00:44:00.427]  No, sir.
[00:44:00.708 --> 00:44:00.848]  They...
[00:44:01.932 --> 00:44:09.740]  Just disregarded that and said that we pushed a security guard and we... See, I was going to guess that was it.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.203]  They always claim that you assault God.
[00:44:12.704 --> 00:44:12.944]  Yes.
[00:44:13.705 --> 00:44:21.313]  And they stated that we used a false identification stating we were federal agents, which was totally bogus.
[00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.571]  But Alex, I just wanted to get to what happened last Thursday.
[00:44:25.611 --> 00:44:26.891]  Well, listen, they're so stupid.
[00:44:26.911 --> 00:44:30.992]  It's like a guy called me last week, and he was talking to the girl he's friends with, a bank teller.
[00:44:31.292 --> 00:44:42.534]  He said, check out these websites, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, TextMars.com, and the police came out to his place and said, why'd you give her a thing saying TexasMassacre.com?
[00:44:42.715 --> 00:44:44.675]  And he says, no, it says TextMars.
[00:44:45.436 --> 00:44:56.343]  It's just, again, they're just... I mean, driving into the rodeo, there was state police, and they just stare at you with hatred, like they're in the Marine Corps.
[00:44:56.363 --> 00:44:59.325]  They're all right back from Iraq, freaking out, looking at every car.
[00:44:59.585 --> 00:45:02.006]  We're all under attack!
[00:45:02.367 --> 00:45:03.167]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:45:04.008 --> 00:45:14.294]  Anyway, last Thursday, on March 6th, at approximately 6 o'clock in the morning, there were 19 individuals around my property...
[00:45:15.822 --> 00:45:17.343]  They rang the doorbell.
[00:45:17.424 --> 00:45:18.364]  I came and answered it.
[00:45:20.686 --> 00:45:21.947]  I asked them for a warrant.
[00:45:21.987 --> 00:45:24.348]  They would not produce it.
[00:45:24.769 --> 00:45:26.890]  Nineteen people marched right into my home.
[00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:31.213]  I later found out it was from six different agencies.
[00:45:32.073 --> 00:45:40.019]  The Diplomatic Security Service, FBI, Homeland Security, Internal Revenue Service, ATF, and my local town of police.
[00:45:40.652 --> 00:45:49.135]  Well, how this works is, see, you got in the database for having silver devil coins and touching a god.
[00:45:49.475 --> 00:45:52.476]  Then your son's driving around with a Ron Paul sticker.
[00:45:52.496 --> 00:45:54.476]  They've all been taught that's enemy of America.
[00:45:54.496 --> 00:45:56.157]  You know, that's Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.461]  Because they're now political officers now.
[00:45:58.481 --> 00:46:01.522]  They're told to punish you for your political stances.
[00:46:01.822 --> 00:46:03.363]  That's in law enforcement manuals now.
[00:46:03.383 --> 00:46:07.144]  It says go ahead and arrest you if you have a get us out of the UN sticker.
[00:46:07.185 --> 00:46:09.425]  That's law enforcement technology magazine.
[00:46:09.966 --> 00:46:14.848]  And so you're now in the database, and so now everywhere you go, planes, anywhere,
[00:46:15.388 --> 00:46:15.468]  Yes.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.261]  So this is the new America.
[00:46:39.281 --> 00:46:40.722]  We're all going to be in databases.
[00:46:41.182 --> 00:46:46.246]  And then just ne'er-do-wells with IQs of about 70 ruling over us with submachine guns.
[00:46:46.506 --> 00:46:48.448]  So they've surrounded your place.
[00:46:48.728 --> 00:46:49.409]  What happens next?
[00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:51.570]  Well, they came into the home.
[00:46:52.271 --> 00:46:53.211]  They marched right in.
[00:46:54.152 --> 00:46:55.974]  And I asked them, why are they here?
[00:46:55.994 --> 00:46:58.235]  And they were looking for a passport.
[00:46:59.036 --> 00:47:02.038]  And I said, well, all you've got to do is look in one particular room.
[00:47:02.058 --> 00:47:07.042]  If you're looking for a passport that is owned by my son, that's where we put it.
[00:47:07.608 --> 00:47:10.849]  They never went to that room until a few hours later.
[00:47:10.889 --> 00:47:15.690]  They searched everything else in the home, and they were here for eight hours and 45 minutes.
[00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:20.891]  We're a mom-and-pop business, and they shut our business down for the whole day.
[00:47:22.091 --> 00:47:26.332]  Nobody could come in our home, and we could not leave.
[00:47:26.392 --> 00:47:26.892]  Now, that's right.
[00:47:26.912 --> 00:47:34.194]  They're claiming that your son had a fake devil passport, but then they weren't even looking for the al-Qaeda weapon.
[00:47:35.194 --> 00:47:35.354]  Right.
[00:47:36.502 --> 00:47:37.522]  Correct.
[00:47:37.582 --> 00:47:45.465]  Now, you told me, or I heard you talking about, that it is an authorized slave paper ID.
[00:47:47.226 --> 00:47:47.526]  Shane?
[00:47:48.646 --> 00:47:56.909]  Alex, yeah, the World Passport is under human rights, and they make them on Washington, D.C.
[00:47:56.949 --> 00:48:02.051]  Yeah, no, that's mainstream news that you can get an international passport, and millions of people do.
[00:48:02.111 --> 00:48:03.312]  I mean, World Net Daily's done articles.
[00:48:03.332 --> 00:48:03.972]  I mean, that is real.
[00:48:04.727 --> 00:48:15.075]  And I had an apostille identification that falls under the Hague Convention, and it's got a little badge on it with my apostille number that I recorded at the county courthouse, pulled out certified, and it has two signatures on their seal.
[00:48:15.295 --> 00:48:16.936]  But again, they weren't even looking for that.
[00:48:16.976 --> 00:48:20.079]  This was their excuse to try to find devil weapons.
[00:48:20.219 --> 00:48:21.199]  Okay, what happened next?
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:30.066]  And I guess, coming from my dad, I wasn't there at the time, but they went ahead and went through the house, and I have all my library.
[00:48:30.086 --> 00:48:32.448]  I have the Alex Jones Library,
[00:48:32.921 --> 00:48:34.882]  And I have some other law information.
[00:48:35.203 --> 00:48:37.064]  And I believe they're scrambling around with that.
[00:48:37.084 --> 00:48:38.425]  They're going to keep it.
[00:48:38.665 --> 00:48:41.347]  My dad and I at the house, we don't know.
[00:48:41.947 --> 00:48:44.589]  Keep the illegal videos?
[00:48:44.849 --> 00:48:48.051]  You're not allowed to have movies that are bestsellers.
[00:48:48.532 --> 00:48:50.773]  Tell me about that, sir.
[00:48:51.934 --> 00:48:52.234]  Dan?
[00:48:52.694 --> 00:48:53.475]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:53.855 --> 00:48:55.977]  They did have it in their hands.
[00:48:56.417 --> 00:48:57.458]  And I will tell you...
[00:48:58.436 --> 00:49:04.837]  I am not sure what they took out of my property because they went in and out of my property easily 50 times.
[00:49:05.698 --> 00:49:13.059]  I have no idea what they took, even when they had me sign a document stating what they were taking.
[00:49:13.139 --> 00:49:19.540]  I asked them if I could just look at the documents, take some copies of them, and they said, no, you don't need to look at them.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.281]  This is what it is.
[00:49:20.301 --> 00:49:22.061]  We're just taking passport information.
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:27.801]  And it was just very disconcerting and rather intimidating.
[00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:31.042]  So, I mean, which of my videos did they have?
[00:49:31.102 --> 00:49:34.102]  Here in Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, can't have those evil videos.
[00:49:34.122 --> 00:49:36.123]  Which of the devil videos did they have?
[00:49:36.803 --> 00:49:37.403]  Endgame.
[00:49:37.803 --> 00:49:38.303]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:49:39.083 --> 00:49:39.924]  Yeah, Endgame, Alex.
[00:49:42.924 --> 00:49:44.325]  Oh, you're not allowed to have that.
[00:49:44.345 --> 00:49:44.985]  That's evil.
[00:49:46.045 --> 00:49:46.205]  Yeah.
[00:49:47.722 --> 00:49:48.683]  So were they sitting there?
[00:49:49.424 --> 00:49:51.185]  Have you seen Abby Newman in Road to Tyranny?
[00:49:51.486 --> 00:50:01.395]  Naval veteran, no criminal record, pulls up to a checkpoint, and they arrest her for a pocket constitution in one of my videos, and the state police pull it out and go, This is illegal!
[00:50:01.835 --> 00:50:05.058]  You're not allowed to have a constitution in America!
[00:50:05.259 --> 00:50:06.280]  Have you ever seen that video?
[00:50:07.701 --> 00:50:08.762]  Yes.
[00:50:08.842 --> 00:50:12.886]  Think about how dumb and brainwashed those two guys are.
[00:50:13.507 --> 00:50:14.808]  Now, remember Kelly Rushing.
[00:50:14.988 --> 00:50:27.596]  He gives them a Ron Paul video and a road to tyranny, and they charged him, took it to court, and said, Ron Paul video and the Alex Jones video threaten law enforcement, is anti-law enforcement, and that's illegal.
[00:50:28.676 --> 00:50:32.478]  See, the cops already think free speech is illegal.
[00:50:33.519 --> 00:50:36.141]  Most of them already think it's illegal.
[00:50:36.661 --> 00:50:38.462]  This country, they built the camps.
[00:50:38.742 --> 00:50:41.064]  They will follow orders, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:41.924 --> 00:50:43.125]  Now, a lot of them aren't.
[00:50:44.113 --> 00:50:53.180]  Totally dumb, but they're hiring brainwashed kids that have been in Iraq for four years who are busy throwing puppies off cliffs and the rest of it.
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.801]  Stay there, both of you.
[00:50:54.841 --> 00:50:55.902]  This just gets worse and worse.
[00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:14.604]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:15.024 --> 00:51:21.746]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:51:22.106 --> 00:51:22.606]  We're good to go.
[00:51:53.008 --> 00:51:55.272]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[00:51:55.652 --> 00:52:00.961]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:52:01.676 --> 00:52:04.618]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:52:04.778 --> 00:52:09.942]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:52:10.302 --> 00:52:15.626]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:52:16.006 --> 00:52:17.127]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:52:17.487 --> 00:52:26.373]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[00:53:01.388 --> 00:53:01.668]  Fact.
[00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:07.775]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:53:07.895 --> 00:53:12.160]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:19.508]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:53:19.948 --> 00:53:20.609]  The solution.
[00:53:20.709 --> 00:53:24.751]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.

[00:53:46.846 --> 00:53:50.367]  We've got top university research professors joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:53:50.407 --> 00:53:54.708]  The FBI is spending close to two-thirds of its time now looking for terrorists, spying on people, and they're going to find them.
[00:54:16.283 --> 00:54:17.704]  They're going to find Ron Paul videos.
[00:54:17.724 --> 00:54:18.964]  They're going to find in-game videos.
[00:54:18.984 --> 00:54:20.825]  They're going to find silver coins.
[00:54:21.726 --> 00:54:22.986]  And then they just freak out.
[00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:25.768]  Oh, we found an Alcada cash!
[00:54:28.209 --> 00:54:32.211]  I mean, 10% of the college graduates for Homeland Security.
[00:54:33.391 --> 00:54:34.112]  Millions of them.
[00:54:34.772 --> 00:54:36.713]  There's no real threat, nothing to deal with.
[00:54:36.753 --> 00:54:38.714]  They're just going to run around and feed on us.
[00:54:39.074 --> 00:54:39.814]  Commissars.
[00:54:40.154 --> 00:54:42.656]  Our government hired the former head of the KGB, Primakov.
[00:54:42.996 --> 00:54:45.497]  They hired the former head of the SCSI, Marcus Wolff.
[00:54:46.275 --> 00:54:47.176]  I heard that five years ago.
[00:54:47.196 --> 00:54:47.716]  I didn't believe it.
[00:54:48.276 --> 00:54:50.498]  Looked it up, and sure enough, it was true.
[00:54:53.379 --> 00:54:57.081]  Look, I'm running over you guys because I'm so freaked out about this, but this is just part of the court.
[00:54:57.101 --> 00:55:01.904]  Remember the guy in Tennessee had the, our judicial system's a joke in his yard?
[00:55:02.124 --> 00:55:05.306]  Out of the judge's jurisdiction, he had him arrested and said that was disrespectful.
[00:55:05.506 --> 00:55:08.268]  Of course, the judge then got thrown off the bench, but they're nuts.
[00:55:08.908 --> 00:55:10.149]  They think they're God.
[00:55:10.169 --> 00:55:11.710]  They think there's no free speech.
[00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:13.771]  What do you think America's all about?
[00:55:14.415 --> 00:55:18.376]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:55:19.296 --> 00:55:20.456]  We have free speech.
[00:55:21.477 --> 00:55:23.537]  So, basically, you guys are encircled.
[00:55:24.257 --> 00:55:30.159]  We're talking to Dan Buczek and his son Shane Buczek up in New York.
[00:55:31.019 --> 00:55:34.220]  And just the harassment just continues, I guess.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:36.820]  Alex, it does.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.641]  In fact, I wanted to complete my story because this is pretty amazing.
[00:55:40.462 --> 00:55:49.207]  After they got done raiding my house in Buffalo, New York, this south town's called Derby, a little town down there, and I got stood there for eight and a half hours.
[00:55:49.447 --> 00:56:04.815]  The very following day, they came out to California, pounded on my door, I refused to open it, and eventually, after numerous phone calls, I let them in, and they took me down to downtown San Francisco Federal Courthouse.
[00:56:06.316 --> 00:56:07.136]  And the...
[00:56:09.147 --> 00:56:12.790]  Public defender ran up to me and says, look, I'm going to try to get you out of here really quick.
[00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:14.771]  Just cooperate, cooperate, cooperate.
[00:56:15.212 --> 00:56:17.533]  He says, this is exactly what we need to do for you today.
[00:56:17.934 --> 00:56:22.237]  You cannot file any liens or any false commercial liens.
[00:56:22.317 --> 00:56:24.198]  You cannot file any lawsuits.
[00:56:24.218 --> 00:56:25.199]  You can't do this, this.
[00:56:25.539 --> 00:56:30.163]  He read a whole bunch of stuff into the record as we were up there.
[00:56:30.423 --> 00:56:31.864]  Actually, the judge read it into the record.
[00:56:32.264 --> 00:56:35.407]  And he also said that I must have an attorney to represent myself.
[00:56:35.767 --> 00:56:35.887]  So...
[00:56:36.604 --> 00:56:40.286]  They pretty much said, okay, we're going to cut off all your legs and your hands here.
[00:56:40.367 --> 00:56:41.407]  Go ahead.
[00:56:41.607 --> 00:56:44.649]  Now you can go out and play with us a little bit.
[00:56:44.729 --> 00:56:50.613]  Yeah, now they just take you directly before the judge and say you have no rights and then might as well take you to Abu Ghraib.
[00:56:50.633 --> 00:56:54.536]  So what are they charging you with, Al-Qaeda?
[00:56:54.596 --> 00:56:55.356]  Title 18.
[00:56:55.557 --> 00:56:57.418]  They said my passport has been forged.
[00:56:57.558 --> 00:56:58.819]  They couldn't find anything else.
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:02.301]  They're saying I made false statements on my passport.
[00:57:02.728 --> 00:57:06.510]  But the funny thing is, there was no false statements.
[00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:15.576]  In fact, I sent in my money order back in December of 2006 and never received a passport.
[00:57:16.377 --> 00:57:18.018]  I paid an expediting fee and everything.
[00:57:18.058 --> 00:57:19.559]  They would never send it to me.
[00:57:19.959 --> 00:57:23.821]  So all I had was my old beat-up one that was destroyed and was lost for a little while.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:33.322]  I found it later on in the storage facility, but it was beat up, and they absolutely completely refused to send out a new passport.
[00:57:33.442 --> 00:57:36.944]  Yeah, but under international treaty, a lot of people have international passports.
[00:57:36.964 --> 00:57:38.024]  You can also get a Malaysian.
[00:57:38.644 --> 00:57:39.985]  Well, so that's what I did.
[00:57:40.005 --> 00:57:44.066]  I went and got a world passport from World Services in Washington, D.C., which is a brand new one.
[00:57:44.146 --> 00:57:45.286]  It looks real nice.
[00:57:45.406 --> 00:57:47.287]  I didn't present it at the border.
[00:57:47.307 --> 00:57:50.568]  I had it in my possession, and I may have to steal my possession.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.401]  Well, this is what they're doing.
[00:57:52.421 --> 00:57:54.382]  I mean, they are just banning protest demonstrations everywhere.
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:20.563]  The Pentagon's spying on peace groups, just running around foaming at the mouth insanely.
[00:58:20.984 --> 00:58:21.344]  Stay there.
[00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:28.610]  I want to do a few more minutes with you guys and see how we can hopefully help you or put some attention on this or do a story for Infowars.com.
[00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:29.670]  Maybe Curt and Emma will do one.
[00:58:30.631 --> 00:58:35.335]  I may need to give you his number or he your number so he can talk to you.
[00:58:35.415 --> 00:58:36.876]  It just never ends, folks.
[00:58:37.076 --> 00:58:40.439]  If you're a Los Zetas commando, you can kill whoever you want.
[00:58:40.459 --> 00:58:44.102]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:47.091 --> 00:58:49.572]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.013 --> 00:58:58.694]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.314 --> 00:59:00.394]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.094 --> 00:59:02.214]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.854 --> 00:59:03.695]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.415 --> 00:59:05.375]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:09.876]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.176 --> 00:59:14.257]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.218 --> 00:59:19.919]  Under the new system the feds are publicly setting up in our international treaty.
[00:59:20.519 --> 00:59:23.920]  You will all have three yearly visits to begin with.
[00:59:24.381 --> 00:59:32.323]  CPS, any dog hair on the floor, any dirty dishes in their snap checks, they just show up.
[00:59:33.015 --> 00:59:34.015]  They will take your children.
[00:59:34.035 --> 00:59:35.076]  You will never see them again.
[00:59:35.096 --> 00:59:36.636]  No due process.
[00:59:36.656 --> 00:59:37.196]  No nothing.
[00:59:37.236 --> 00:59:38.457]  It's reign of evil.
[00:59:38.997 --> 00:59:43.098]  I was saying earlier when we hit the break, Los Zetas paramilitary in Texas can kill whoever they want.
[00:59:43.698 --> 00:59:44.478]  Openly ruling.
[00:59:44.859 --> 00:59:46.079]  Whole area shutting down.
[00:59:46.399 --> 00:59:47.519]  Media won't even report on it.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.120]  But you got a $2 bill at Best Buy, you will be arrested.
[00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:52.561]  Doesn't matter if it's real money.
[00:59:53.841 --> 01:00:00.243]  It's just, you're out videotaping, you know, anything that they now, the police believe it's illegal.
[01:00:00.323 --> 01:00:01.464]  They're going to put cameras on you.
[01:00:01.504 --> 01:00:02.604]  You can't have cameras on them.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:11.123]  Again, they hired the former head of the KGB and the former head of the East German Secret Police to help set all this up, and now they've done it.
[01:00:11.603 --> 01:00:12.804]  It's not fully in place.
[01:00:12.844 --> 01:00:19.827]  The 23,000 preachers, the 26,000 preachers, 23,000 InfraGard executives, all the tattletale squads.
[01:00:21.047 --> 01:00:22.388]  But this is just one family.
[01:00:22.588 --> 01:00:26.129]  And by the way, submitting to them, trying to get along with them won't help you.
[01:00:26.149 --> 01:00:27.410]  This is meant for everybody.
[01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:30.551]  10% of the graduates now are going to work for this.
[01:00:30.791 --> 01:00:32.712]  Just a total shifting of the infrastructure.
[01:00:33.419 --> 01:00:34.820]  And they will eat.
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:35.761]  They will have meat.
[01:00:36.101 --> 01:00:36.962]  They will feed on you.
[01:00:37.782 --> 01:00:38.783]  They will find enemies.
[01:00:38.843 --> 01:00:39.924]  They will find terrorists.
[01:00:40.444 --> 01:00:41.465]  You are the terrorist.
[01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:43.527]  Because you fight terrorism.
[01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:44.387]  You fight evil.
[01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:45.328]  You fight for the nation.
[01:00:45.648 --> 01:00:47.630]  You're a patriot who bleeds red, white, and blue.
[01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:48.690]  You are the enemy.
[01:00:49.671 --> 01:00:57.077]  And this was in a bunch of news articles when Dan Buczek got arrested.
[01:00:57.097 --> 01:01:00.099]  The father, nice, clean cut, business owner, no criminal record.
[01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:06.736]  For them showing people silver dollar coins and saying, you know, hey, this is real money.
[01:01:07.779 --> 01:01:08.100]  This is...
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.161]  I mean, literally, that's how they are now.
[01:01:11.221 --> 01:01:14.343]  And, I mean, I've got cops on video believing pocket constitutions are illegal.
[01:01:14.363 --> 01:01:14.383]  I
[01:01:34.256 --> 01:01:36.418]  They're like, oh my God, we found a devil weapon.
[01:01:36.779 --> 01:01:38.440]  I've got it on their own squad car video.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.982]  Freaking out in fear over the Constitution.
[01:01:41.223 --> 01:01:41.883]  You idiots.
[01:01:42.484 --> 01:01:43.745]  And I'm talking about those that don't know.
[01:01:43.765 --> 01:01:47.508]  There's good cops out there who haven't been brainwashed yet or haven't succumbed to it.
[01:01:47.989 --> 01:01:50.531]  You swore an oath to that, you fool.
[01:01:52.473 --> 01:01:53.614]  So where does this go?
[01:01:53.654 --> 01:01:54.695]  They've charged you.
[01:01:55.716 --> 01:01:56.657]  Where is this going?
[01:01:57.358 --> 01:01:59.920]  What are you facing, Shane?
[01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:10.446]  Well, the judge says that if I don't report back to Buffalo by Friday at 2 o'clock, that I would be locked up indefinitely.
[01:02:11.967 --> 01:02:16.652]  It is Wednesday right now, and I'm still debating if I should even go back, because...
[01:02:17.341 --> 01:02:22.465]  Under the 11th Amendment, they can't extradite me back to... Listen, they don't care.
[01:02:22.525 --> 01:02:26.828]  They'd love to come and gun you down and claim and drop al-Qaeda leaflets around you.
[01:02:27.048 --> 01:02:28.549]  They need to show al-Qaeda.
[01:02:28.729 --> 01:02:30.050]  They need to attack Iran.
[01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:37.555]  They're about to take the dollar totally down and bankrupt everybody, and they're going to need to put people like you on TV to scare all the blue hairs.
[01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:38.836]  Right, correct.
[01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:42.559]  No, you need to go... Listen, if I was you, I would go back...
[01:02:43.573 --> 01:02:45.655]  And I would go crazy in the media.
[01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:47.317]  I would countersue them.
[01:02:47.337 --> 01:02:53.423]  I would just point out how this is insane, how you were using your old passport to go into Toronto.
[01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:56.906]  And I would call local news.
[01:02:56.966 --> 01:02:57.927]  I'd make the biggest stink.
[01:02:58.528 --> 01:03:00.670]  But believe me, sir, they'd love it if you didn't show up.
[01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:04.934]  They'll gun you down, splatter your intestines everywhere, and dance around in your blood.
[01:03:07.073 --> 01:03:08.415]  You might be correct, Alex.
[01:03:08.675 --> 01:03:13.359]  And the thing, one thing I want to point out before we go... I think America is very important to them, okay?
[01:03:13.579 --> 01:03:15.200]  They hate you because you love this country.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:15.540]  Go ahead.
[01:03:16.301 --> 01:03:16.481]  Right.
[01:03:16.941 --> 01:03:31.133]  One thing I wanted to point out, if I just back up two years ago, which is very, very annoying to me, is that the security guard by the name of Ed Cotter in Buffalo, New York, the HSBC game, we were playing the New York Islanders one day after Christmas.
[01:03:31.153 --> 01:03:31.933]  We all got silver.
[01:03:31.953 --> 01:03:32.654]  We were all excited.
[01:03:32.674 --> 01:03:35.036]  The thing that still bothers me to this day, he said...
[01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:35.752]  Oh, I know.
[01:03:35.772 --> 01:03:36.733]  They have no conscience.
[01:03:36.773 --> 01:03:40.476]  They think ruining lives, it's nothing to them.
[01:03:40.536 --> 01:03:41.397]  Stay there.
[01:03:53.903 --> 01:04:01.829]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:04:02.289 --> 01:04:05.451]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[01:04:05.831 --> 01:04:08.893]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[01:04:36.724 --> 01:04:37.624]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.607 --> 01:04:55.289]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:59.053]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:04:59.233 --> 01:05:01.135]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:05:01.696 --> 01:05:04.439]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:05:04.759 --> 01:05:08.643]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[01:05:08.683 --> 01:05:09.023]  We're good to go.
[01:05:27.312 --> 01:05:27.752]  And so much more.
[01:05:27.772 --> 01:05:29.694]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[01:05:29.714 --> 01:05:30.795]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:30.815 --> 01:05:31.696]  Burn the info bombs to dust.
[01:05:31.716 --> 01:05:33.537]  Put them on the file-sharing networks.
[01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:34.879]  Bring down the New World Order.
[01:05:34.919 --> 01:05:35.459]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:53.915 --> 01:05:58.839]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.041]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[01:06:01.242 --> 01:06:04.284]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:06:04.464 --> 01:06:07.607]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:06:07.907 --> 01:06:09.769]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:13.732]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:16.675]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:06:17.295 --> 01:06:21.558]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:06:21.799 --> 01:06:26.082]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:30.826]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[01:06:31.146 --> 01:06:33.168]  These materials document the global leaders.
[01:06:33.348 --> 01:06:34.548]  That's 1-888-211-1715 and ask for packet B.
[01:06:54.907 --> 01:07:00.932]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.552 --> 01:07:04.595]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.216 --> 01:07:08.158]  This is supposed to be a free country.
[01:07:09.439 --> 01:07:10.740]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.742]  We have a Bill of Rights, a Constitution.
[01:07:12.802 --> 01:07:13.782]  Why was that so precious?
[01:07:14.303 --> 01:07:17.866]  Because in other nations, corrupt people swaddle around
[01:07:19.332 --> 01:07:30.398]  Swagger around in uniforms, just feeding on you, doing whatever they want, abusing you, taxing you, shoving you around, and now that's coming here to the U.S.
[01:07:30.438 --> 01:07:45.907]  And there's all this media brainwashing and billboards, and it's all for our safety, and again, Al-Qaeda's everywhere, so we have to be oppressed, we have to be controlled, and they've taken hundreds of thousands of our young men, sent them to Iraq, turned them into PTSD victims,
[01:07:46.653 --> 01:07:47.454]  Brought them back.
[01:07:48.034 --> 01:07:50.756]  They're used to checkpoints, shooting people, control.
[01:07:51.336 --> 01:07:52.577]  Now they've built the camps.
[01:07:52.617 --> 01:07:53.297]  They've admitted it.
[01:07:53.397 --> 01:07:54.178]  I mean, this is it.
[01:07:55.559 --> 01:07:56.820]  And they have nothing to do.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.041]  There's no one fighting them.
[01:07:58.061 --> 01:07:59.241]  There's no one threatening them.
[01:07:59.862 --> 01:08:02.423]  So all they can do is just run around freaking out.
[01:08:03.264 --> 01:08:07.166]  It all starts when, oh, the silver coins and the security guard.
[01:08:07.767 --> 01:08:09.488]  And this has come out on tape.
[01:08:09.528 --> 01:08:10.949]  Police have been recorded when they don't know it.
[01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:16.336]  We've played it the last few months, several instances, where the cop's going, I'll frame you.
[01:08:16.356 --> 01:08:17.697]  I'll lie.
[01:08:18.138 --> 01:08:19.399]  Your life's going to be over.
[01:08:19.419 --> 01:08:21.301]  In fact, I'm going to lie on you.
[01:08:23.804 --> 01:08:25.046]  Now, he got fired over that.
[01:08:25.546 --> 01:08:27.789]  Then they started harassing and threatening the people that recorded it.
[01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:29.751]  And that really is the answer.
[01:08:29.791 --> 01:08:30.592]  They surveil us.
[01:08:30.672 --> 01:08:31.774]  We surveil them right now.
[01:08:32.415 --> 01:08:35.055]  Now, again, the higher-ups want them to act like this.
[01:08:35.075 --> 01:08:41.797]  There's still a lot of good police who don't carry this out, and that's why the whole system hasn't fallen apart yet.
[01:08:43.317 --> 01:08:44.957]  But it's all coming to a head.
[01:08:45.577 --> 01:08:50.038]  The good news is they can't even keep ahead of CENTCOM because he refuses to attack Iran.
[01:08:50.698 --> 01:08:55.559]  The good news is everybody knows the White House has thousands of male prostitutes visiting it, mainstream news.
[01:08:55.919 --> 01:08:57.539]  Why are they burning Spetzer?
[01:08:58.159 --> 01:09:01.200]  Probably was a good guy now that I've really analyzed it compared to the others.
[01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:04.615]  We're in a crisis here.
[01:09:05.676 --> 01:09:06.476]  We're in a crisis.
[01:09:06.516 --> 01:09:13.760]  And the police need to know you're being brainwashed and turned against us so you can have your pension funds taken and nobody's going to stand up for you.
[01:09:14.201 --> 01:09:15.781]  So we can have our pension funds taken.
[01:09:16.222 --> 01:09:17.102]  And it's all going to happen.
[01:09:17.122 --> 01:09:17.923]  You're going to see it happen.
[01:09:17.943 --> 01:09:19.343]  I know you're laughing now.
[01:09:19.583 --> 01:09:21.004]  It's real funny right now.
[01:09:21.404 --> 01:09:23.526]  But you're going to find out how evil this government is.
[01:09:23.966 --> 01:09:29.849]  And when America was known as Nazi Germany and all the rest of it happens, just at least don't still say it was good then.
[01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:47.506]  You know, when you're old men, okay, and then, you know, they're still digging up mass graves of Americans, just remember what you did, what you were part of, and that people were there and warned you and begged you to stop.
[01:09:48.926 --> 01:09:49.787]  All right.
[01:09:51.507 --> 01:09:54.629]  I'd imagine the crack houses in your town are doing just fine.
[01:09:54.929 --> 01:09:55.909]  They're leaving those open.
[01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:57.730]  It's so disgusting.
[01:09:58.809 --> 01:10:00.430]  Government ships the drugs in, everything.
[01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:01.530]  It's just a sick joke.
[01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:04.611]  Dan Buczek and his son, Shane Buczek.
[01:10:05.011 --> 01:10:09.193]  So you're saying this security guard, why did he take this added pleasure?
[01:10:09.213 --> 01:10:20.096]  I mean, was it just to dominate him, or did you argue with him, and he thought arguing was a challenge to his intellect, and this was an argument he was going to win?
[01:10:20.136 --> 01:10:22.177]  Because I wonder why...
[01:10:23.197 --> 01:10:26.599]  We've got so many tapes of police saying, I'm going to set you up, I'm going to frame you.
[01:10:26.959 --> 01:10:28.080]  How they sleep at night.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:40.126]  Or how this state trooper who arrested Kelly Rushing, Kelly Rushing, upstanding member of the community, newspaper reported on that, no criminal record, Lyon County, Kentucky, had him on the set four years ago.
[01:10:40.547 --> 01:10:45.429]  He gave him Ron Paul's neocon speech from the floor of the house, and on the end of that was road to tyranny.
[01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:51.993]  And in the court case, I got the papers, it said that the Ron Paul video was threatening and anti-government.
[01:10:52.777 --> 01:11:00.630]  And that the Road to Tyranny video was anti-police, and I called the judge at home, and I said, why are you doing this?
[01:11:01.351 --> 01:11:07.721]  I called information, the judge answered, and he said, well, it's a case, I can't discuss that case, but yes, the case is going forward.
[01:11:08.755 --> 01:11:11.356]  And then later we got the court documents, and they went to court.
[01:11:11.396 --> 01:11:16.399]  The jury said not guilty, but he was facing two three-year sentences for terrorist threats.
[01:11:16.459 --> 01:11:21.902]  And they played videos in there and said, well, look, this video says that the police are bad.
[01:11:22.342 --> 01:11:23.022]  It didn't say that.
[01:11:23.062 --> 01:11:26.344]  It showed cops arresting someone for a pocket Constitution.
[01:11:26.564 --> 01:11:28.705]  And that was the part they didn't like.
[01:11:29.225 --> 01:11:33.107]  See, they were so mentally ill and so brainwashed that they had to validate it.
[01:11:34.008 --> 01:11:36.569]  That yes, yes, the Constitution's illegal.
[01:11:37.821 --> 01:11:40.063]  This is not satire, folks, if you're a new listener.
[01:11:40.223 --> 01:11:41.083]  This really happened.
[01:11:41.804 --> 01:11:42.484]  Both the things.
[01:11:42.844 --> 01:11:44.985]  Kentucky and Virginia.
[01:11:45.986 --> 01:11:46.666]  The first incident.
[01:11:47.227 --> 01:11:49.108]  And I've got scores of these on tape now.
[01:11:50.148 --> 01:11:56.372]  You see, the cops saw that and it freaked him out so bad that he then saw Kelly rushing a few days later.
[01:11:56.872 --> 01:11:57.873]  He pulls Kelly over.
[01:11:57.953 --> 01:11:58.813]  They live near each other.
[01:11:59.434 --> 01:12:00.174]  Waited for Kelly.
[01:12:01.335 --> 01:12:02.115]  Kelly came out.
[01:12:02.976 --> 01:12:04.977]  Kelly rushing's family is very prominent there in town.
[01:12:04.997 --> 01:12:06.418]  One of the oldest families there in the area.
[01:12:07.618 --> 01:12:10.779]  And pulled Kelly over, and Kelly said, Hey, how'd you like the tape?
[01:12:10.819 --> 01:12:11.420]  He said, Get out.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.080]  You're going to jail.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:12.660]  That's a threat.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:18.663]  Put him in the back of the car, laughed at him, called his wife on the cell phone and said, I've got the videotape bandit with me.
[01:12:20.383 --> 01:12:24.665]  And then Kelly said, and that's why you've got to keep your mouth shut, Kelly said, Man, I care about you.
[01:12:25.366 --> 01:12:28.247]  Kelly's a really sweet guy, and he was in the church and all that.
[01:12:28.327 --> 01:12:29.327]  I didn't just believe him.
[01:12:29.347 --> 01:12:30.408]  I didn't just believe the news articles.
[01:12:30.468 --> 01:12:31.868]  I randomly called people in the town.
[01:12:35.029 --> 01:12:36.949]  This was so unbelievable to me four years ago.
[01:12:36.989 --> 01:12:38.350]  Now I know it's par for the course.
[01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:41.690]  And just a real sweet guy.
[01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:43.450]  And he said, man, I care about you.
[01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:44.851]  Don't you care about your children?
[01:12:45.771 --> 01:12:46.331]  Don't you care?
[01:12:46.391 --> 01:12:48.131]  I mean, don't you understand this is hurting America?
[01:12:48.771 --> 01:12:51.212]  And the guy didn't put a third charge on, but that got dropped.
[01:12:51.252 --> 01:12:53.272]  I'm saying, don't you care about your children?
[01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:58.133]  He started freaking out, going, you're saying my children, you will threaten me.
[01:12:58.993 --> 01:12:59.473]  Literally.
[01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:03.614]  You see, the mental illness, it's mass, mass, just nuttiness.
[01:13:04.292 --> 01:13:08.433]  To where he was already arresting him for no reason, and deep down the guy had guilt.
[01:13:08.853 --> 01:13:12.874]  And so he had to then legitimize it even more when Kelly was saying, I'm doing this for your family, man.
[01:13:13.194 --> 01:13:14.274]  Don't you love your children?
[01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:16.075]  Don't you care about their future?
[01:13:16.595 --> 01:13:17.935]  And he, like, slammed the brakes on them.
[01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:21.396]  You're threatening my family, boy!
[01:13:22.216 --> 01:13:24.357]  Oh, you don't do that!
[01:13:25.177 --> 01:13:26.517]  Just idiots.
[01:13:27.658 --> 01:13:28.158]  Idiots.
[01:13:28.998 --> 01:13:30.959]  And I know there are a lot of good state police here in Texas.
[01:13:32.579 --> 01:13:32.639]  Uh...
[01:13:34.133 --> 01:13:37.496]  One time I was in a car wreck, and two of them pulled up, and they were fans of the show, and they were nice, really nice.
[01:13:37.896 --> 01:13:38.857]  But others are crazy.
[01:13:38.877 --> 01:13:42.020]  I mean, driving into the rodeo, they're there when you pay for your parking.
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:43.101]  You've got to pay for a ticket.
[01:13:43.121 --> 01:13:51.188]  And there's like a guy, high and tight, military stance, like it's Iraq, and he's staring at you crazy, and he looks in your car, and it's like, what?
[01:13:51.768 --> 01:13:53.009]  This country's gone!
[01:13:53.249 --> 01:13:54.030]  It's gone!
[01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:55.111]  It's gone!
[01:13:55.852 --> 01:13:56.632]  It's gone!
[01:13:57.953 --> 01:14:00.736]  And we're not getting it back until we admit it's gone.
[01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:06.351]  All right, you guys have the last five minutes, and I've got to get into the other news and cover things.
[01:14:06.872 --> 01:14:07.892]  I'm sorry I'm running over you.
[01:14:07.932 --> 01:14:10.053]  This just freaks me out when I see this type of stuff.
[01:14:10.073 --> 01:14:18.397]  You know, when you talk about somebody saying, I'm going to falsify this report, boy.
[01:14:19.117 --> 01:14:20.377]  Who's the boss now?
[01:14:20.437 --> 01:14:24.779]  Because that's such injustice.
[01:14:24.819 --> 01:14:25.800]  That's so evil.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.642]  Dan Buczek, go ahead, or Shane Buczek, finish up what you were saying.
[01:14:31.671 --> 01:14:45.014]  Yeah, Alex, if there's anybody out there in the show that has any suggestions about the case, but I've been working very diligently on how to defend myself on this.
[01:14:45.495 --> 01:14:47.235]  By the way, team, I think it's Section 1001.
[01:14:47.495 --> 01:14:56.717]  And the thing that's fascinating is that I believe this is... I think they're very worried about the Liberty Dollar case that we have put in the appellate division.
[01:14:57.238 --> 01:14:57.938]  I think this is...
[01:14:59.571 --> 01:15:01.552]  Some kind of leverage for us to back off.
[01:15:01.632 --> 01:15:04.412]  That's why I think they came after my parents like that.
[01:15:05.373 --> 01:15:07.974]  This is just... Wait a minute.
[01:15:08.034 --> 01:15:09.754]  You have filed cases against them?
[01:15:11.475 --> 01:15:17.596]  No, I have sent my story to every legislator, everybody in New York State, including the FBI.
[01:15:17.636 --> 01:15:18.937]  What was this about an appellate case?
[01:15:18.957 --> 01:15:21.137]  Are you a party to the Liberty Dollar suit?
[01:15:21.898 --> 01:15:22.118]  Yes.
[01:15:22.998 --> 01:15:24.739]  Oh, this is pure retaliation.
[01:15:25.599 --> 01:15:26.319]  Yeah.
[01:15:26.519 --> 01:15:29.280]  Oh, so you had some orders there at the Liberty Mint
[01:15:30.124 --> 01:15:31.505]  When they shut that down last year.
[01:15:31.525 --> 01:15:34.187]  So you answered the call to class action, Sue.
[01:15:35.068 --> 01:15:36.829]  Oh, now we see.
[01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:39.872]  And our personal cases at the Appellate Division, too.
[01:15:39.992 --> 01:15:41.293]  Oh, well, there's the answer.
[01:15:41.313 --> 01:15:49.519]  But, I mean, going back to how this two years ago, you say, where does the security guard claim you pushed him?
[01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:51.821]  Dad?
[01:15:54.243 --> 01:15:55.424]  That's a good question.
[01:15:55.444 --> 01:15:59.607]  The bottom line is when he had us in a room
[01:16:01.079 --> 01:16:05.641]  And he stated that we pushed him there, which was very untrue.
[01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:09.082]  Oh yeah, they love the claim you assault them behind closed doors.
[01:16:09.502 --> 01:16:09.743]  Yes.
[01:16:11.103 --> 01:16:16.365]  And there were individuals in the room that, had we subpoenaed them, they would have to tell the truth.
[01:16:18.506 --> 01:16:26.809]  I work with the police department, and there's good police officers in every department, every one I can imagine.
[01:16:26.829 --> 01:16:26.949]  I have...
[01:16:27.991 --> 01:16:32.395]  Many friends will question Ed Cotter and what he did.
[01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:37.839]  But I really believe there's more to this picture than meets the eye.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.341]  And he was ordered to do what he did.
[01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:43.124]  And he just continued to perjure himself.
[01:16:44.004 --> 01:16:45.786]  And this is all on record.
[01:16:46.346 --> 01:16:56.134]  But the sad thing is what they pulled off here on March 6th, the witch hunt, coming into my home and looking for something, contrabands or whatever,
[01:16:57.662 --> 01:16:59.463]  Bombs or drugs or whatever.
[01:16:59.483 --> 01:17:00.864]  Devil weapons, yeah.
[01:17:01.204 --> 01:17:03.646]  Yeah, it's just very sad, very sad.
[01:17:03.706 --> 01:17:10.150]  It's very disheartening, and we're just hoping for justice in time.
[01:17:11.539 --> 01:17:12.800]  Well, it's only going to get worse.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.545]  With 10% of the college grads literally being secret spy police, it's over.
[01:17:17.565 --> 01:17:21.309]  I mean, they're just going to be everywhere feeding on us, stomping around in black uniforms.
[01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:28.515]  Just every mental case, every control freak, every bully you knew in school ruling you, just dominating us all.
[01:17:29.236 --> 01:17:29.917]  Hell is here.
[01:17:29.997 --> 01:17:30.638]  Tyranny's here.
[01:17:30.658 --> 01:17:30.958]  We're in a
[01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:36.912]  50 million abortions, we're an evil demon nation, and we're now going to be judged, and that's just basically the end of it.
[01:17:37.713 --> 01:17:44.676]  Why don't you give out your phone number, any websites, contact points, where people can support you as these pig demons have their way with you.
[01:17:46.356 --> 01:17:46.737]  Okay.
[01:17:48.377 --> 01:17:54.000]  DanB at Boochek-Inc.com Say it again, your phone's a little sketchy.
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:18:00.583]  DanB at Boochek-Inc.com It's D-A-N-B as in boy, at B as in boy, U-C...
[01:18:02.014 --> 01:18:05.557]  Z as in Zebra, E-K-I-N-C dot com.
[01:18:07.138 --> 01:18:07.598]  All right.
[01:18:07.678 --> 01:18:11.501]  Well, gentlemen... Alex, can I just mention one more thing?
[01:18:12.402 --> 01:18:12.982]  Yeah.
[01:18:13.282 --> 01:18:16.264]  My email address is very easy to remember.
[01:18:16.504 --> 01:18:18.966]  It's RonPaulSilver at AOL.
[01:18:20.627 --> 01:18:21.928]  RonPaulSilver at AOL.
[01:18:21.948 --> 01:18:24.310]  Well, gentlemen, as this develops, stay in contact.
[01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:25.831]  You've got my producer's number.
[01:18:26.672 --> 01:18:29.073]  And this is what tyranny is all about.
[01:18:29.133 --> 01:18:29.794]  I appreciate your call.
[01:18:30.603 --> 01:18:31.803]  I mean, you bet.
[01:18:31.843 --> 01:18:35.044]  As a nation, we are all pig-like, slovenly demons.
[01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:38.165]  I mean, you just look at the public themselves, not just the police.
[01:18:38.785 --> 01:18:39.985]  We're just maggots.
[01:18:40.326 --> 01:18:40.746]  It's over.
[01:18:40.926 --> 01:18:41.286]  It's over.
[01:18:41.326 --> 01:18:43.026]  They're going to take everything you got.
[01:18:43.306 --> 01:18:44.367]  They're going to butcher it all.
[01:18:45.147 --> 01:18:47.547]  And, you know, that's basically it.
[01:18:47.567 --> 01:18:48.208]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:50.228]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:50.348 --> 01:18:52.009]  A new world order.
[01:18:58.374 --> 01:19:03.436]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:19:03.456 --> 01:19:05.037]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[01:19:06.098 --> 01:19:08.299]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:19:08.899 --> 01:19:11.340]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:19.504]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.406 --> 01:19:27.368]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:31.331]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:31.731 --> 01:19:34.233]  Bill Burr is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:19:34.293 --> 01:19:35.434]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.454 --> 01:19:36.234]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.254 --> 01:19:37.315]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.515 --> 01:19:38.276]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.496 --> 01:19:39.196]  That's their after news.

[01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:04.780]  America, Freedom to Fascism.

[01:21:52.822 --> 01:21:54.423]  The whole country's on a bust.
[01:21:54.443 --> 01:21:55.664]  A crazy driver.
[01:21:56.084 --> 01:21:59.587]  If the passengers can't get hold of the wheel, we're all going to go over the cliff.
[01:21:59.847 --> 01:22:04.751]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.
[01:22:04.891 --> 01:22:08.033]  Domestic spying, wiretapping, government shipping, and more.
[01:22:08.474 --> 01:22:11.516]  The enemy of my enemy is my ally.

[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.184]  People should look one another in the eye before they go killing for causes.
[01:22:26.204 --> 01:22:29.367]  I have always kept the interests of my country first and foremost.
[01:22:38.536 --> 01:22:40.398]  And I always will.
[01:22:40.718 --> 01:22:44.681]  UncivilLiberties.com Because in this world, liberty is all that we have.
[01:22:44.801 --> 01:22:47.143]  And we must take it back.
[01:22:47.223 --> 01:22:48.524]  Support independent media.
[01:22:48.724 --> 01:22:58.812]  Purchase a copy today at UncivilLiberties.com Strange days are here, my friends.
[01:23:00.053 --> 01:23:02.795]  They're going to destroy us.
[01:23:03.236 --> 01:23:05.758]  Strange days have fallen.
[01:23:11.108 --> 01:23:13.789]  We're back live.
[01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:36.700]  Again, there are a lot of great people in this nation, wonderful firefighters, wonderful police.
[01:23:40.854 --> 01:23:42.975]  Good federal marshals, FBI agents.
[01:23:44.196 --> 01:23:46.258]  But we were slowly seduced by evil.
[01:23:47.458 --> 01:23:49.099]  Very wicked people run our nation.
[01:23:49.159 --> 01:23:51.581]  They are setting up a total police state grid.
[01:23:53.262 --> 01:23:55.303]  They are openly stating what they plan to do.
[01:23:57.445 --> 01:24:02.107]  And I want to just tell the police listening out there that think I'm a kook, think I'm a nut.
[01:24:03.688 --> 01:24:04.709]  Maybe I am crazy.
[01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:09.152]  I mean, I'm crazy when I got squad car video of them arresting a woman for a pocket constitution.
[01:24:10.839 --> 01:24:15.522]  That we put free in every videotape order, every CD order we send out, DVD we send out.
[01:24:16.783 --> 01:24:20.166]  Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution, Founding Father Quotes.
[01:24:20.306 --> 01:24:21.166]  Man, that's not bad.
[01:24:21.506 --> 01:24:22.107]  That's not evil.
[01:24:22.147 --> 01:24:23.228]  What's wrong with you people?
[01:24:24.368 --> 01:24:26.070]  And I've got the federal training manuals.
[01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:27.691]  I've got the law enforcement magazines.
[01:24:27.731 --> 01:24:30.853]  I put up my films where they say that's illegal and evil and arrest people.
[01:24:32.085 --> 01:24:36.927]  I mean, I have mainstream law enforcement magazines where they say, if somebody's got to get us out of the U.N.
[01:24:36.947 --> 01:24:43.030]  sticker, go ahead and take them into jail, and police chiefs support your officers because there's probably somebody legal they've done.
[01:24:43.050 --> 01:24:46.191]  I mean, that was in the magazine in, what, 2001?
[01:24:48.052 --> 01:24:48.692]  Right before 9-11.
[01:24:50.013 --> 01:24:50.713]  It's crazy.
[01:24:50.833 --> 01:24:58.256]  I have FEMA on tape in Kansas City to a huge classroom of firefighters, police, and sheriff's deputies saying the founding fathers are bad.
[01:24:59.777 --> 01:25:01.578]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:25:02.282 --> 01:25:05.625]  I have the Phoenix memo with the FBI seal and phone number.
[01:25:05.665 --> 01:25:06.286]  It's been in the news.
[01:25:06.346 --> 01:25:06.786]  It's real.
[01:25:07.307 --> 01:25:11.151]  From 1999, saying those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:25:11.191 --> 01:25:12.972]  Constitution are terrorists.
[01:25:13.413 --> 01:25:15.095]  Second Amendment groups are terrorists.
[01:25:15.515 --> 01:25:16.376]  And cops, you know.
[01:25:17.327 --> 01:25:18.788]  You've all been given the same stuff.
[01:25:18.828 --> 01:25:21.869]  Man, what is going... This is like a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:30.813]  Imagine a Twilight Zone episode back in the 60s where in America the Founding Fathers are bad and freedom is bad and free speech is bad.
[01:25:31.093 --> 01:25:32.754]  They made episodes actually like that.
[01:25:35.535 --> 01:25:35.816]  Sigh.
[01:25:38.617 --> 01:25:39.537]  And it happened.
[01:25:40.137 --> 01:25:41.418]  What is going on here?
[01:25:41.438 --> 01:25:45.380]  Sigh.
[01:25:47.699 --> 01:25:49.340]  And I just don't want all this to happen.
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:50.640]  I don't want this to play out.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:51.980]  I don't want World War III.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.941]  I don't want the dollar to be destroyed.
[01:25:56.002 --> 01:26:10.286]  I have the government documents from the University of Texas Studies and the Pulitzer Prize winning books on World War II and all the documents on how they know sodium fluoride causes brain damage, massive IQ reductions, and they put it in our water to dumb us down.
[01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:13.247]  The government doesn't like you officers.
[01:26:14.324 --> 01:26:17.325]  Please go research and find out they're poisoning you by design.
[01:26:17.585 --> 01:26:18.785]  Is that a good government?
[01:26:19.045 --> 01:26:20.245]  Is that good people?
[01:26:21.185 --> 01:26:23.906]  And don't sit there and roll your eyes and say I'm making this up.
[01:26:24.466 --> 01:26:29.187]  A lot of you in the system have been listening to me for a long time, and you've heard everything I talk about come true and happen.
[01:26:30.347 --> 01:26:34.048]  It's wrong that our government is using al-Qaeda to attack Iran.
[01:26:35.288 --> 01:26:40.929]  It's wrong that they used them, who they set up in 79, in the late 90s to attack the Serbs.
[01:26:43.627 --> 01:26:44.267]  It's wrong.
[01:26:44.887 --> 01:26:45.527]  It's bad.
[01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:46.428]  It's not good.
[01:26:47.788 --> 01:26:55.550]  It's bad that they had basically ordered Admiral Fallon to prepare the attack on Iran.
[01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:59.031]  It's wrong that they ordered him to resign.
[01:27:00.771 --> 01:27:02.271]  We've had it so good in this country.
[01:27:03.171 --> 01:27:09.573]  They're not gearing up with preachers telling their flock to turn their guns in and go to camps because they want to play a game of badminton.
[01:27:11.021 --> 01:27:17.885]  They're not gearing up InfraGard and all this infrastructure and all this paranoia and watch the citizens and gear up for martial law for nothing.
[01:27:19.226 --> 01:27:20.927]  They are destroying the dollar.
[01:27:20.947 --> 01:27:22.388]  They're destroying the country.
[01:27:23.068 --> 01:27:28.152]  Every federal policy, from bad-mouthing the dollar to interest rate cuts, is killing it.
[01:27:28.572 --> 01:27:34.395]  Do you realize that that's killing not just your savings, but your paycheck's value and purchase?
[01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:36.877]  They're poisoning your water officers.
[01:27:37.517 --> 01:27:39.899]  They are devaluing your money.
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:42.861]  And you think this government's good?
[01:27:43.761 --> 01:27:49.903]  You pull over teenagers who've got marijuana cigarettes, and you take them to jail?
[01:27:50.983 --> 01:27:59.786]  When it's been all over the news a thousand times, and even the CIA's inspector general admits they bring in large portions of the narcotics?
[01:28:01.406 --> 01:28:07.008]  But you'll take that youngster to jail for marijuana when the government ships it in and launders it?
[01:28:09.693 --> 01:28:10.953]  By the way, I hate marijuana.
[01:28:11.814 --> 01:28:12.534]  And I hate drugs.
[01:28:12.574 --> 01:28:13.494]  I tell people don't use them.
[01:28:15.535 --> 01:28:16.455]  But that's how you stop.
[01:28:16.495 --> 01:28:17.355]  It's with education.
[01:28:17.815 --> 01:28:20.736]  You don't send them to jail where they learn how to be real criminals.
[01:28:22.857 --> 01:28:24.317]  Look, this isn't a joke.
[01:28:25.098 --> 01:28:26.198]  This is your future too.
[01:28:26.658 --> 01:28:27.378]  I've said it before.
[01:28:27.538 --> 01:28:28.178]  I'll say it again.
[01:28:28.699 --> 01:28:30.359]  Whether you like it or not, you're with us.
[01:28:30.979 --> 01:28:33.840]  You may think on paper you're with the winners and you're with the big guys.
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.561]  No, they're using you and you're with the people.
[01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:43.300]  So whether you like it or not, you're in the same boat as me.
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:45.200]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.301]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.201 --> 01:28:50.982]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.263 --> 01:28:57.044]  The Road Warrior radio broadcast bringing you the quickening.
[01:28:57.524 --> 01:29:00.845]  Are you tired of talk shows that preach over you and talk over your head?
[01:29:01.105 --> 01:29:07.007]  Eric Arthur Blair, commonly known as George Orwell, said the great enemy of clear language is insincerity.
[01:29:07.725 --> 01:29:09.466]  Are you tired of all the misinformation and lies?
[01:29:27.092 --> 01:29:29.413]  Are you hearing too much noise and not enough signal?
[01:29:29.513 --> 01:29:35.535]  The Road Warrior Radio unveils the truth and exposes the lies and disinfo that pervade society.
[01:29:35.855 --> 01:29:40.597]  Have you noticed all areas of American civics have slanted in to usher in the one world nation state?
[01:29:40.837 --> 01:29:44.979]  The Road Warrior Radio broadcast is dedicated to presenting the quickening at hand.
[01:29:45.319 --> 01:29:46.179]  Time is running out.
[01:29:46.419 --> 01:29:49.441]  Tune into the quickening on the Road Warrior Radio broadcast.
[01:29:53.917 --> 01:29:55.539]  Attention GCN listeners.
[01:29:55.639 --> 01:29:59.823]  Would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[01:29:59.924 --> 01:30:11.376]  Well, now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[01:30:11.796 --> 01:30:12.437]  We're good to go.
[01:30:30.353 --> 01:30:30.793]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:30:57.279 --> 01:30:58.980]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:02.522]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[01:31:03.122 --> 01:31:07.804]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on, often dangerous, food imports.
[01:31:08.445 --> 01:31:10.446]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:16.549]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[01:31:17.269 --> 01:31:20.931]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[01:31:21.875 --> 01:31:25.597]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[01:31:26.117 --> 01:31:31.260]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:40.185]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[01:31:40.665 --> 01:31:41.926]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:41.946 --> 01:31:42.246]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:57.884 --> 01:32:16.498]  I want to talk about foreign troops taking over, not just our military, but every other major western military.
[01:32:16.518 --> 01:32:19.180]  But first, let's go to some of your phone calls.
[01:32:22.199 --> 01:32:26.401]  Ted in Texas, then Tina, Charles, Jeremiah, Scott, and others.
[01:32:26.841 --> 01:32:27.621]  Ted, you're on the air.
[01:32:27.661 --> 01:32:28.001]  Welcome.
[01:32:28.581 --> 01:32:29.042]  Hi, Alex.
[01:32:30.062 --> 01:32:30.422]  Welcome.
[01:32:30.982 --> 01:32:33.523]  I wanted to weigh in on the water issue.
[01:32:34.724 --> 01:32:50.730]  I've been a certified swimming pool operator for several years, and what I'd like to tell everyone is that you're actually better off drinking swimming pool water than tap water simply because whenever I fill up a pool for people to swim in,
[01:32:51.314 --> 01:33:02.717]  The water that comes out of the city is ready to go as far as it has 3.0 parts per million chlorine in it, which is what is required for a swimming pool to keep it sanitary.
[01:33:03.217 --> 01:33:12.080]  And the pH is about 12 to 13, which is very high and causes limestone and calcification buildup.
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:19.962]  And so my point is that swimming pool and tap water are identical.
[01:33:20.678 --> 01:33:35.534]  Except for the fact that when I treat the pool water for swimming, I have to lower the pH to about 7.5 so that it doesn't... Let me give some people some background, Ted, and I'd like you to write a 4 or 5 paragraph, 10 paragraph, whatever you want to do, article...
[01:33:36.352 --> 01:33:43.995]  Send it, because what you just said I know is accurate, because back when I worked at a golf course and before that at another golf course, I would have to work with the guys in the pools.
[01:33:44.135 --> 01:33:48.237]  I'm a novice when it comes to it, but I remember them all commenting on it.
[01:33:48.557 --> 01:33:51.899]  Then I talked about the pool guy at my neighborhood pool, talking to him about it.
[01:33:51.919 --> 01:33:53.019]  He told me the same info.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:59.302]  And they said that when you fill a pool, you don't have to add chlorine generally for about a week.
[01:33:59.952 --> 01:34:02.053]  Because then it comes out in the atmosphere.
[01:34:03.113 --> 01:34:11.976]  It precipitates out in the atmosphere because it's a little bit higher than even what you need in a pool that has average use.
[01:34:13.237 --> 01:34:18.939]  And that exactly, they just would have to lower the pH because it would burn your eyes if it was tap water.
[01:34:18.979 --> 01:34:25.121]  Again, fish will die even if it's aerated within about a day and a half in water.
[01:34:25.868 --> 01:34:26.248]  I think so.
[01:34:50.437 --> 01:34:51.417]  Take the leaves out of the pool.
[01:34:51.437 --> 01:34:53.398]  They'd have the guy there testing chemicals.
[01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:58.719]  And I remember having discussions about how sometimes they'd drain the pool at the start of the year.
[01:34:58.739 --> 01:35:00.720]  They'd refill it, and they'd say, yeah, we don't have to add any chlorine.
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:03.300]  There's more chlorine in the water supply than there is in the pool.
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:04.801]  The point is it kills a fish.
[01:35:04.841 --> 01:35:05.721]  It kills a frog.
[01:35:06.541 --> 01:35:09.982]  Waterborne insects can't live in it, but we're drinking it.
[01:35:10.755 --> 01:35:16.779]  And all the studies about chlorine alone and kidney and bladder cancer, it's all there.
[01:35:16.859 --> 01:35:18.860]  So I don't have enough writers, enough people.
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:31.068]  We need to get that out because millions would read the article in the aggregate over time about how fish die in your drinking water, basically, and then explaining the whole pool situation.
[01:35:31.648 --> 01:35:34.050]  So are you calling in to concur with what I was saying yesterday?
[01:35:34.710 --> 01:35:35.391]  Absolutely.
[01:35:35.811 --> 01:35:38.913]  And one of the things I haven't heard discussed was that
[01:35:39.349 --> 01:35:41.530]  You know, we have beneficial bacteria.
[01:35:41.610 --> 01:35:42.731]  Actually, I've heard you discuss this.
[01:35:42.751 --> 01:35:49.294]  We have beneficial bacteria in our gut, and you put it in three parts per million chlorinated water, it kills it.
[01:35:49.874 --> 01:35:57.838]  And so, you know, that's a serious health consideration right there because, you know, you've got the chlorine in the pool to kill disease and keep it sanitary.
[01:35:57.878 --> 01:36:01.640]  Well, you put it in your stomach, what do you think it's going to do to your beneficial bacteria?
[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:04.962]  It's going to sanitize your digestive tract.
[01:36:06.283 --> 01:36:08.984]  So it's really bad, and I'll get that article to you, Alex.
[01:36:09.938 --> 01:36:12.800]  Well, our water supply just gets worse and worse.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:14.861]  And then they joke and say, don't filter your water.
[01:36:14.921 --> 01:36:16.062]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:36:16.502 --> 01:36:19.084]  Just like I told the people in the system last segment.
[01:36:19.524 --> 01:36:21.345]  We're not lying to you about any of this.
[01:36:21.765 --> 01:36:23.827]  You can check and see what sodium fluoride does.
[01:36:23.867 --> 01:36:25.488]  You can check and see what chlorine does.
[01:36:26.028 --> 01:36:29.930]  You can look into everything we're saying, even if you hate us and don't believe us.
[01:36:30.791 --> 01:36:37.495]  At least care about your children enough to look into what we're saying, then you'll find out it's true, and then filter your children's water.
[01:36:38.696 --> 01:36:38.756]  Um...
[01:36:40.569 --> 01:36:42.710]  Again, a fish dies in tap water.
[01:36:43.051 --> 01:36:44.031]  How are we drinking it?
[01:36:46.453 --> 01:36:49.675]  What I would like to say is that... Oh, I lost it.
[01:36:49.775 --> 01:36:50.055]  Oh, well.
[01:36:50.475 --> 01:36:50.935]  No, go ahead.
[01:36:50.955 --> 01:36:55.058]  Gosh, you're going to have to talk for a second, Alex.
[01:36:55.138 --> 01:36:56.018]  I lost my train of thought.
[01:36:56.699 --> 01:36:59.961]  Well, that's easy to do when I'm adding things to it, but I just want to be clear with everybody.
[01:37:00.501 --> 01:37:01.802]  This is not our opinion.
[01:37:03.846 --> 01:37:05.387]  So that's the basic MO, though?
[01:37:05.407 --> 01:37:11.911]  When you fill a pool, you just have to usually, depending on the water supply, mess with the pH, not the chlorine, for about a week, right?
[01:37:12.351 --> 01:37:16.794]  You just add a little acid to bring it down, to bring the pH down, the chlorine's set to go.
[01:37:16.814 --> 01:37:25.699]  And what I did want to let you know is that when I stopped drinking tap water about eight years ago because of the chlorine, I stopped getting sick.
[01:37:26.519 --> 01:37:30.682]  I went from being sick to three times a year seasonally
[01:37:31.195 --> 01:37:35.779]  So maybe once a year, just that alone, stopping drinking the tap water.
[01:37:35.939 --> 01:37:39.762]  Didn't get the flu, didn't get the sniffles, didn't get the seasonal allergies.
[01:37:40.723 --> 01:37:41.743]  Really incredible stuff.
[01:37:42.424 --> 01:37:44.626]  Well, then they demonize bottled water.
[01:37:44.646 --> 01:37:49.650]  They're trying to ban it from San Francisco to Paris, from London to Toronto.
[01:37:49.670 --> 01:37:53.873]  The Canadian government is trying to ban it in all government buildings, but I mean cities are trying to ban it, period.
[01:37:54.494 --> 01:37:55.034]  We're good to go.
[01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:22.994]  Don't drink bottled water either.
[01:38:23.554 --> 01:38:28.399]  Get a sports Berkey, or go pay more for one at a camping supply.
[01:38:28.459 --> 01:38:29.060]  I don't care.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:30.401]  Literally, I don't care.
[01:38:30.421 --> 01:38:34.324]  And at least that cuts out the chlorine and the bacteria.
[01:38:34.365 --> 01:38:35.826]  It only reduces the fluoride.
[01:38:36.246 --> 01:38:40.130]  Or get the actual big Berkey that knocks out the fluoride and all the rest of it.
[01:38:41.111 --> 01:38:42.973]  Get a reverse osmosis, whatever you've got to do.
[01:38:43.333 --> 01:38:45.295]  Just please, folks, please.
[01:38:45.395 --> 01:38:46.316]  I mean, this is real.
[01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:52.758]  And I know they've told you it's not, everything's fine, but we have all the documents, and we have them.
[01:38:53.399 --> 01:39:01.845]  And if you go to the EPA's own website, they admit thousands of allowable chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, MBTE, whatever.
[01:39:01.865 --> 01:39:03.987]  I mean, it's just, you add it up, it's unbelievable.
[01:39:04.087 --> 01:39:04.928]  Hundreds of drugs.
[01:39:05.368 --> 01:39:06.949]  And that was in the AP this weekend.
[01:39:06.969 --> 01:39:10.332]  Of course, most cities would not release it, like Dallas.
[01:39:12.282 --> 01:39:15.484]  But the last time Dallas came, it was actually Grand Prairie.
[01:39:15.524 --> 01:39:16.665]  My memory now serves me.
[01:39:17.045 --> 01:39:22.528]  Grand Prairie did a test, and they had higher levels of Prozac than the scientists believed.
[01:39:22.548 --> 01:39:23.589]  It was like five years ago.
[01:39:23.989 --> 01:39:24.889]  Maybe it was six years ago.
[01:39:24.909 --> 01:39:25.550]  Time flies.
[01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:28.311]  Then what could be released by the people's urine?
[01:39:28.952 --> 01:39:30.053]  So, see, something's going on.
[01:39:30.093 --> 01:39:31.073]  They're adding stuff.
[01:39:31.393 --> 01:39:32.414]  We're just in deep trouble.
[01:39:33.635 --> 01:39:34.075]  Anything else?
[01:39:35.188 --> 01:39:50.311]  Yeah, the one thing that I noticed was that when I saw the media coming out on Kview and they were trying to, you know, demonize the water bottles, you know, problem, reaction, solution, I thought it was very odd that the solution they offered was to drink tap water.
[01:39:50.791 --> 01:39:55.192]  To me, it would seem that the solution would be to protect yourself by drinking filtered water.
[01:39:56.352 --> 01:40:03.173]  Very simple to do, but they offer tap water as a solution, so that brings, that is an eyebrow raiser right there.
[01:40:04.321 --> 01:40:05.001]  It certainly is.
[01:40:05.041 --> 01:40:05.521]  Well said.
[01:40:05.561 --> 01:40:06.302]  Good to hear from you.
[01:40:06.422 --> 01:40:15.664]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, we wouldn't reach one-tenth the people if it wasn't for you taking my audio, ranch, and adding video and documents to it.
[01:40:16.564 --> 01:40:18.225]  You go out and find everything I'm saying is true.
[01:40:18.265 --> 01:40:20.265]  You add articles, documents, government links.
[01:40:21.105 --> 01:40:21.946]  You put it on the web.
[01:40:22.046 --> 01:40:22.786]  Millions watch it.
[01:40:22.806 --> 01:40:23.526]  We're waking people up.
[01:40:24.261 --> 01:40:26.422]  Because I'm so busy, don't have the funding for enough staff.
[01:40:26.882 --> 01:40:33.765]  I wish I had the money for two or three people to sit out there, take all my audio, add documents to all of it, and just put it on the web.
[01:40:34.285 --> 01:40:34.806]  But we don't.
[01:40:35.146 --> 01:40:36.026]  Well, you're doing it.
[01:40:36.226 --> 01:40:36.566]  Good.
[01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:44.330]  You see, it's the habitualization.
[01:40:44.370 --> 01:40:46.951]  You're so trained from growing up to drink tap water.
[01:40:47.992 --> 01:40:49.213]  You're so trained to do it.
[01:40:49.233 --> 01:40:54.335]  You're so trained to drink the water at the store or to not demand restaurants filter their water.
[01:40:54.375 --> 01:40:56.796]  Boy, if they announce that, they get more business.
[01:40:57.157 --> 01:40:58.637]  Starbucks, by the way, does filter their water.
[01:40:58.677 --> 01:41:00.178]  That's why the coffee tastes so much better.
[01:41:00.939 --> 01:41:03.980]  I mean, I grew up in Dallas, folks, and nobody told me water was bad.
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:05.201]  Nobody told me about all this.
[01:41:05.521 --> 01:41:11.024]  I remember being five, six, seven years old and getting up feeling fine in the morning, drinking a big glass of water, getting a headache.
[01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:11.884]  It tasted bad.
[01:41:11.944 --> 01:41:12.724]  It smelled.
[01:41:12.744 --> 01:41:17.707]  I remember visiting family in Houston where the water literally smells like gasoline.
[01:41:19.150 --> 01:41:20.911]  With all those refineries and chemical plants.
[01:41:22.411 --> 01:41:25.312]  All the studies out of Houston, highest cancer rates in the country.
[01:41:28.013 --> 01:41:36.257]  You know, it's just, we get so trained, just like with cell phones, which they now admit cause brain tumors, that we just can't stop.
[01:41:36.337 --> 01:41:37.557]  We've got to stop.
[01:41:39.878 --> 01:41:46.101]  Now, I'm going to go back to your calls, but I want to get back into the head of SimCom Designing.
[01:41:46.221 --> 01:41:47.181]  I've got an article here.
[01:41:48.112 --> 01:41:59.198]  Where in Europe they're trying to make people take vaccines, and it says the bioethics boards, there's no law, they just regulatorily say you'll be arrested if you don't.
[01:41:59.238 --> 01:42:00.699]  Now, what is bioethics?
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:03.661]  Well, that's what eugenics grew out of.
[01:42:03.681 --> 01:42:13.546]  And you can have a debate within bioethics, but generally those are the ones saying in mainstream headlines, oh, under new socialized health care, if you're old, you won't get care.
[01:42:14.106 --> 01:42:15.087]  Or you won't get care first.
[01:42:15.791 --> 01:42:17.793]  First it's if you're fat, if you smoke, if you drink.
[01:42:17.833 --> 01:42:18.954]  Now it's if you're old.
[01:42:19.774 --> 01:42:22.957]  See, they stopped giving the Hippocratic Oath in Europe 20 years ago, in the U.S.
[01:42:23.197 --> 01:42:27.581]  12 years ago or so, where doctors gave a pledge, I will do no harm.
[01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:31.985]  So see, it's all changing into we're human resources.
[01:42:33.186 --> 01:42:35.348]  See how it's all hidden in plain view, right in front of your face?
[01:42:35.728 --> 01:42:39.691]  And then the system's going to decide, like Logan's run, who lives and who dies.
[01:42:42.934 --> 01:42:44.075]  They know what they're doing.
[01:42:45.368 --> 01:42:47.691]  And this is the scientific elite.
[01:42:47.751 --> 01:42:51.194]  They decided we're dumb cattle, so they decided to dumb us down even further.
[01:42:51.535 --> 01:43:04.789]  They say the middle class threatens the hegemony, the monopoly of power of the elite, and so they want to destroy the economies so that we are all basically in compact, government-controlled cities living on government welfare or under government jobs, so we're under their control.
[01:43:05.586 --> 01:43:11.531]  And then they say, under that system, they can then sterilize us, euthanize us, kill us, one-child policies.
[01:43:12.132 --> 01:43:15.174]  One-child policy started as an environmental tax in 1975.
[01:43:15.735 --> 01:43:16.996]  In 1980, it became law.
[01:43:18.057 --> 01:43:20.439]  They're now proposing that there, as I told you they would.
[01:43:20.479 --> 01:43:23.382]  That's in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:43:23.402 --> 01:43:30.148]  In fact, I'm looking for that article.
[01:43:30.228 --> 01:43:30.548]  I just...
[01:43:31.929 --> 01:43:32.969]  We're good to go.
[01:43:32.989 --> 01:43:33.370]  We're good to go.
[01:44:02.907 --> 01:44:07.670]  Folks, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, is not fun.
[01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:11.131]  Okay?
[01:44:13.173 --> 01:44:13.793]  Now listen to me.
[01:44:14.353 --> 01:44:16.634]  Then they'll joke and say, oh, everything gives you cancer.
[01:44:18.595 --> 01:44:19.036]  That's right.
[01:44:21.497 --> 01:44:23.138]  If you live long enough, you're going to get cancer.
[01:44:23.198 --> 01:44:25.519]  But did you know that in 1940, one in 33 people died of cancer?
[01:44:33.035 --> 01:44:34.576]  One in three now die of cancer.
[01:44:37.357 --> 01:44:37.938]  And guess what?
[01:44:38.058 --> 01:44:42.640]  We live supposedly two years longer than people did in 1940.
[01:44:44.621 --> 01:44:45.922]  And that's a skewed number too.
[01:44:48.663 --> 01:44:50.784]  Because then you'll argue, well, you're living longer.
[01:44:50.824 --> 01:44:51.945]  That's why more people die of cancer.
[01:44:52.005 --> 01:44:52.185]  No.
[01:44:53.285 --> 01:44:54.246]  It's only two years longer.
[01:44:55.135 --> 01:44:56.936]  By the way, our life expectancy is dropping.
[01:44:57.296 --> 01:45:01.839]  When it peaked out in the mid-90s, it's 77 for a woman, 75 for a man.
[01:45:02.179 --> 01:45:03.880]  What is it, 72 for a man?
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:06.761]  75 for a woman?
[01:45:07.522 --> 01:45:08.062]  Go look it up.
[01:45:08.142 --> 01:45:09.783]  It changes each year, but it's right in there.
[01:45:10.723 --> 01:45:12.124]  Russia is like 51.
[01:45:13.185 --> 01:45:15.346]  Native Americans, males, it's 43.
[01:45:16.927 --> 01:45:18.227]  The op's going well, isn't it?
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:24.280]  Why is that a skewed number?
[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:31.942]  Because infant mortality was much higher in the 1940s than it is now.
[01:45:32.402 --> 01:45:36.083]  So they would average all the babies that died at birth or soon thereafter.
[01:45:36.103 --> 01:45:41.064]  Because back then, if you were five months, six months old when you were born, most of the time you died.
[01:45:41.104 --> 01:45:42.444]  Now, most of the time you live.
[01:45:43.424 --> 01:45:44.924]  They know how to save those smaller babies.
[01:45:46.605 --> 01:45:47.485]  That's just one area.
[01:45:48.855 --> 01:46:01.764]  If you take out the infant mortality, we're living on average about 10, we have this story on this, about 10 years less than we lived in 1940.
[01:46:01.804 --> 01:46:03.085]  10 years less.
[01:46:03.405 --> 01:46:04.846]  See, they average in all the dead babies.
[01:46:05.126 --> 01:46:12.691]  So, the babies, zero, or a month, averaged in, that drives down the number for 1940.
[01:46:13.052 --> 01:46:17.575]  But you take the dead babies out of it, we're not living as long.
[01:46:17.675 --> 01:46:17.815]  Now,
[01:46:19.958 --> 01:46:20.898]  I'm pontificating.
[01:46:20.938 --> 01:46:30.541]  The point here is that the big thing is the water and the GMO foods.
[01:46:31.421 --> 01:46:33.241]  And this is something we can take control in our lives.
[01:46:33.281 --> 01:46:36.162]  The New World Order can't stop us from not using cell phones.
[01:46:36.642 --> 01:46:38.563]  They can't stop us from filtering our water.
[01:46:39.203 --> 01:46:46.604]  They can't stop us from getting serious and at first reducing and then cutting out all the GMO food in our diet.
[01:46:48.085 --> 01:46:48.745]  They can't stop you.
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:55.123]  Now, they brag that if they're able to continue to proliferate the GMO food, you won't have any choice but GMO food.
[01:46:55.143 --> 01:46:58.184]  They're putting all their competition out of business, buying up all the seed companies.
[01:46:59.245 --> 01:47:00.445]  Let me tell you something if you're a cop.
[01:47:01.066 --> 01:47:02.306]  Maybe you framed a lot of people.
[01:47:02.366 --> 01:47:03.687]  You falsified a lot of reports.
[01:47:03.707 --> 01:47:04.667]  You think it's cute and funny.
[01:47:05.828 --> 01:47:07.429]  You can be forgiven for what you've done.
[01:47:07.489 --> 01:47:11.111]  You'll live a lot better life, feel better about yourself if you stop going with the peer pressure.
[01:47:11.451 --> 01:47:13.072]  You don't know how you turned into what you are.
[01:47:13.092 --> 01:47:14.732]  I want you to know I love you.
[01:47:16.153 --> 01:47:17.234]  I want you to do well.
[01:47:18.014 --> 01:47:19.735]  I want your children to be healthy and happy.
[01:47:20.626 --> 01:47:22.807]  I don't want your dollar to be devalued.
[01:47:23.447 --> 01:47:30.049]  I don't want you to die of liver cancer or pancreas cancer or kidney cancer when you're 40 years old.
[01:47:30.569 --> 01:47:35.551]  I don't want you to get early onset of Alzheimer's, which is now exploding everywhere when you're 45.
[01:47:35.951 --> 01:47:37.871]  I don't want that to happen to me.
[01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:40.532]  I want to see you do well.
[01:47:41.452 --> 01:47:42.533]  I believe in that.
[01:47:46.434 --> 01:47:48.595]  And you just need to find out where your friends.
[01:47:48.695 --> 01:47:49.635]  You need to find out right now.
[01:47:52.253 --> 01:47:54.515]  Because tyranny comes to your door in a uniform.
[01:47:55.056 --> 01:47:56.297]  And you're going to be asked to do things.
[01:47:56.337 --> 01:47:57.918]  You're being asked to do things you know are wrong.
[01:47:57.938 --> 01:47:59.960]  And it's time to start saying no.
[01:48:04.284 --> 01:48:05.125]  Tina in Mass.
[01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:05.585]  You're on the air.
[01:48:05.665 --> 01:48:06.206]  Thanks for holding.
[01:48:06.746 --> 01:48:07.307]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:07.627 --> 01:48:08.008]  Hi.
[01:48:09.609 --> 01:48:13.192]  I'm just going to follow up on what that man said, but it has nothing to do with water.
[01:48:13.252 --> 01:48:14.514]  It has to do with soy.
[01:48:15.094 --> 01:48:15.815]  I have a...
[01:48:16.348 --> 01:48:18.169]  Personal story about that.
[01:48:18.269 --> 01:48:25.813]  My son was going into special ed services since the time he was three years old up until now.
[01:48:25.933 --> 01:48:42.561]  He's eight years old and the problem was he had trouble with short-term memory and the ability for speech and language and I did a lot of research and found that soy was one of the culprits in his life and I don't know if it was GMO soy or what but
[01:48:43.221 --> 01:48:48.084]  As a baby, he got a lot of soy in his formula because my husband was vegan.
[01:48:48.104 --> 01:48:50.205]  We were trying to live as a family.
[01:48:50.225 --> 01:48:50.705]  No, no, no.
[01:48:50.725 --> 01:48:56.008]  Look, all these vegans, a lot of them are basically killing their kids all the time just giving them soy.
[01:48:56.328 --> 01:48:59.250]  They have to have fatty acids.
[01:48:59.270 --> 01:49:03.432]  They have to have the stuff that comes from fish or the stuff that comes right out of your milk.
[01:49:04.433 --> 01:49:07.595]  Well, we've totally gone off the vegan diet.
[01:49:08.475 --> 01:49:14.719]  We're more choosy about the vegetables and stuff that we eat.
[01:49:14.739 --> 01:49:15.259]  Well, stay there.
[01:49:15.279 --> 01:49:15.960]  I'm going to hold you over.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:16.840]  I want to hear this story.
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.881]  Because here's the bottom line.
[01:49:20.782 --> 01:49:24.945]  The brain is 70% water, and then it's about 28% cholesterol and 2% sugar.
[01:49:24.965 --> 01:49:25.705]  It is an oil computer.
[01:49:34.036 --> 01:49:34.396]  It's oil.
[01:49:34.897 --> 01:49:35.538]  It's cholesterol.
[01:49:36.479 --> 01:49:41.023]  Like when people are having seizures, one of the biggest treatments now is giving them a wide spectrum fats.
[01:49:42.645 --> 01:49:45.027]  Why do you think the government says eat low fat, folks?
[01:49:45.088 --> 01:49:46.329]  I've got their studies on that.
[01:49:47.050 --> 01:49:48.511]  Your brain doesn't work without it.
[01:49:48.952 --> 01:49:50.113]  Fat is brain food.
[01:49:50.133 --> 01:49:51.114]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.335 --> 01:50:07.100]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:14.203]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:50:14.563 --> 01:50:14.983]  We're good to go.
[01:50:45.466 --> 01:50:47.731]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:50:48.112 --> 01:50:53.426]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:50:53.951 --> 01:51:02.360]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:51:02.661 --> 01:51:07.766]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[01:51:07.807 --> 01:51:08.347]  and Canada.
[01:51:08.667 --> 01:51:15.195]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC free.
[01:51:15.735 --> 01:51:19.017]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:51:19.157 --> 01:51:21.378]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:51:21.598 --> 01:51:27.961]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[01:51:28.201 --> 01:51:31.503]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.

[01:51:38.767 --> 01:51:41.728]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[01:51:41.928 --> 01:51:45.050]  This superfood will be your greatest asset, so try it today.
[01:51:53.433 --> 01:51:58.934]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:51:59.374 --> 01:52:03.596]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:52:04.016 --> 01:52:10.878]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:52:11.318 --> 01:52:18.025]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:52:18.346 --> 01:52:19.968]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:52:20.248 --> 01:52:23.431]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:52:23.712 --> 01:52:26.174]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:52:26.495 --> 01:52:33.222]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:52:33.642 --> 01:52:36.324]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:52:36.584 --> 01:52:39.966]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free at 866-885-6625.
[01:52:40.006 --> 01:52:40.366]  That's 866-885-6625.
[01:52:40.426 --> 01:52:42.188]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:53:02.199 --> 01:53:02.619]  Yeah.
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:04.001]  Babies drink milk.
[01:53:04.101 --> 01:53:07.524]  Mammals drink milk, and it's full of fat, and that's needed for brain growth.
[01:53:08.244 --> 01:53:11.087]  So, going back to Tina, glad you found out about this.
[01:53:11.107 --> 01:53:14.370]  So you got your son off of the soy.
[01:53:14.410 --> 01:53:14.890]  What happened?
[01:53:16.151 --> 01:53:29.443]  Well, it was about a year ago when we discovered the problem with the food, and I took him off the soy, and I started giving him fish pills, you know, the DHA, omega-3 fish pills.
[01:53:29.463 --> 01:53:29.623]  Mm-hmm.
[01:53:30.785 --> 01:53:35.408]  It took a long time, but now he's doing so much better.
[01:53:35.428 --> 01:53:45.393]  He has to learn how to remember things now in a new way, but he's doing so much better in school.
[01:53:46.253 --> 01:53:47.414]  The teachers just are...
[01:53:49.375 --> 01:53:51.597]  Really impressed with his turnaround.
[01:53:51.717 --> 01:53:54.679]  And now it's your job to warn all these other vegans who mean well.
[01:53:55.119 --> 01:54:02.485]  It happens all the time that they don't breastfeed and they don't eat any fatty because most of these plants don't have the fats you need.
[01:54:02.505 --> 01:54:03.546]  They have nothing but protein.
[01:54:03.826 --> 01:54:05.207]  The soy basically has no fat.
[01:54:05.845 --> 01:54:09.889]  And then their portable brains can't grow because they're not getting it, and nobody's telling them that.
[01:54:10.330 --> 01:54:11.531]  Well, that's part of the problem.
[01:54:11.571 --> 01:54:15.355]  And also, I was eating a lot of the soy products, too, and everybody was.
[01:54:15.435 --> 01:54:22.062]  But my husband and I realized once we stopped using the soy, we had, like, a constant brain fog.
[01:54:22.682 --> 01:54:28.028]  And then after, like, a couple of months, a brain fog lifted, and we could think a little clearer.
[01:54:28.777 --> 01:54:34.098]  So it really impacted our ability to think and remember and recall things.
[01:54:34.379 --> 01:54:39.520]  I mean, I'm not 100% better, in my opinion, but I'm doing a lot better than I was before.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:50.363]  Well, also, a lot of these companies take the whole soybean and then grind up the core as well, and that is basically pure plant estrogen.
[01:54:51.112 --> 01:54:51.392]  Yeah.
[01:54:51.452 --> 01:54:53.313]  And so that totally whacks you out as well.
[01:54:53.333 --> 01:54:57.376]  Yeah, no, soy is just, it's a filler in everything, and it's bad news.
[01:54:57.736 --> 01:54:59.017]  It's just about in everything.
[01:54:59.057 --> 01:55:03.940]  So I try to avoid anything with it as soy flour, even the soy lecithin.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.862]  I just try to avoid it as much as possible.
[01:55:07.482 --> 01:55:12.985]  And another point I wanted to make, I don't remember, but it's unrelated.
[01:55:13.005 --> 01:55:14.806]  I'll just throw it out there in passing.
[01:55:15.106 --> 01:55:20.049]  My sister called me today, and I'm not going to mention the name of the place that she works.
[01:55:20.190 --> 01:55:20.930]  It's a prominent place.
[01:55:21.587 --> 01:55:23.408]  Building in Boston where she works at.
[01:55:23.428 --> 01:55:29.190]  And then she found out today there's gas masks in the closets on every floor.
[01:55:30.190 --> 01:55:33.651]  And she asked the people, like, hey, what are these for?
[01:55:33.671 --> 01:55:34.952]  And they were like, well, we don't know.
[01:55:34.992 --> 01:55:36.432]  They just want them to be there.
[01:55:37.312 --> 01:55:39.053]  And I don't know.
[01:55:39.093 --> 01:55:40.753]  We just thought that was kind of curious.
[01:55:41.534 --> 01:55:42.834]  And I don't know.
[01:55:42.894 --> 01:55:43.654]  That was just something.
[01:55:43.714 --> 01:55:44.715]  And one other thing I wanted to say.
[01:55:44.735 --> 01:55:48.496]  Well, the media tells us to not have gas masks, but the government buildings all have them, yeah.
[01:55:49.716 --> 01:55:51.177]  She's in a government building, isn't she?
[01:55:52.329 --> 01:55:55.291]  No, but she's in a big financial institution building.
[01:55:55.851 --> 01:56:01.475]  Yeah, but she gets to see a lot of things going on, you know, across papers throughout the day.
[01:56:02.215 --> 01:56:05.997]  But anyway, I don't want to go off too far off.
[01:56:06.077 --> 01:56:11.080]  I just wanted to ask you, is it Dylan Avery that got taken back to the military?
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:15.403]  I was wondering how he was doing because we haven't heard much about him since last year.
[01:56:16.232 --> 01:56:16.972]  I don't know.
[01:56:17.012 --> 01:56:18.113]  Was it July or June?
[01:56:18.853 --> 01:56:21.314]  No, that's Cory Rowe, and he's fine.
[01:56:21.374 --> 01:56:22.054]  He's out of the military.
[01:56:22.495 --> 01:56:22.875]  Oh, okay.
[01:56:22.935 --> 01:56:24.055]  I'm sorry to confuse that.
[01:56:24.715 --> 01:56:31.438]  Okay, well, I'm sorry, and thank you for bringing me on the phone, and I hope to talk to you again in the future with some more good information.
[01:56:31.538 --> 01:56:31.918]  Thank you.
[01:56:31.938 --> 01:56:32.899]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:32.939 --> 01:56:35.160]  Yeah, back in the 50s, they said, it's the modern age.
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:36.160]  Don't breastfeed your baby.
[01:56:36.784 --> 01:56:48.107]  And then every few months I see a story out of Asia or Africa where the UN ships in, quote, free formula for the children, and then, oh, accidentally it doesn't have the fats in it, and the babies just die.
[01:56:50.047 --> 01:56:51.288]  They just flat out die.
[01:56:51.788 --> 01:56:52.288]  Don't believe me?
[01:56:52.308 --> 01:56:56.609]  Just Google children die, formula recall Africa.
[01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:59.129]  There's hundreds of cases.
[01:56:59.189 --> 01:57:00.650]  It's just always accidental.
[01:57:01.210 --> 01:57:05.691]  Oh, we have formula for you, but it doesn't have the fat in it.
[01:57:07.461 --> 01:57:08.642]  And the babies just die.
[01:57:09.623 --> 01:57:13.647]  See, there's a reason mommy's milk is filled with fat.
[01:57:14.408 --> 01:57:16.530]  That's because baby needs fat.
[01:57:19.513 --> 01:57:20.213]  Oh, man.
[01:57:21.074 --> 01:57:21.735]  So sick.
[01:57:23.336 --> 01:57:25.479]  It's just unbelievable the things that are going on.
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:27.901]  Look, breastfeed your children.
[01:57:28.582 --> 01:57:29.402]  Don't be lazy.
[01:57:30.223 --> 01:57:30.824]  Breastfeed them.
[01:57:35.495 --> 01:57:38.357]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:38.837 --> 01:57:41.058]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.484 --> 01:57:51.144]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.785 --> 01:57:52.865]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:54.667]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.307 --> 01:57:56.127]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.888 --> 01:57:57.808]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.449 --> 01:58:02.411]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.631 --> 01:58:04.993]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[01:58:05.874 --> 01:58:06.715]  Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.097 --> 01:58:15.502]  We were about to go to Scott in Arizona, but he just dropped, so we're going to go to Charles, Jeremiah, Kyle, Chris, and others.
[01:58:15.562 --> 01:58:19.905]  I'm going to try to move a little quicker now, because I've got a bunch of news on vaccines I want to get to.
[01:58:21.526 --> 01:58:23.508]  Charles in South Dakota, you're on the air.
[01:58:24.819 --> 01:58:25.420]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.081]  Actually, I'm in San Diego.
[01:58:27.321 --> 01:58:28.262]  Oh, well, FD.
[01:58:28.302 --> 01:58:28.722]  Same thing.
[01:58:28.742 --> 01:58:29.343]  Go ahead.
[01:58:29.643 --> 01:58:29.903]  Yeah.
[01:58:30.243 --> 01:58:47.397]  Hey, I caught the tail end of a program you had on recently, and it was about inoculations and the possibility of our government providing contaminated vaccines for our people that may have HIV and hepatitis C and things like that in them.
[01:58:47.817 --> 01:58:50.219]  And I was wondering... There's no doubt about it.
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:52.221]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:58:53.081 --> 01:59:00.225]  Yeah, and I was just wondering if you could shed some light on it, because I came in on a tail-end part of it, and I didn't get the whole scoop.
[01:59:00.826 --> 01:59:04.768]  Sure, did you hear a caller yesterday saying, Alex, don't call them tainted.
[01:59:04.848 --> 01:59:05.888]  All the vaccines are bad.
[01:59:05.928 --> 01:59:07.109]  Is that what you're talking about?
[01:59:07.569 --> 01:59:08.150]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:19.216]  Yeah, and then I elaborated, and I said, no, you can trust none of the companies, none of them, because every major company's been caught putting all these different drugs on the market that they know kill people.
[01:59:19.756 --> 01:59:22.118]  And I used the example of Bayer Pharmaceuticals,
[01:59:22.738 --> 01:59:51.962]  In over 50 nations, from Australia to the U.S., from Spain to Canada, everywhere, they were convicted in France, their own documents came out, where for more than a decade, to millions of patients, hemophiliacs and other blood disorder folks around the world, they knowingly did not screen the blood, and they knew in the Factor VIII, because they mixed thousands of different patches of blood and a centrifuge together to get the Factor VIII, they knew that every injection
[01:59:53.212 --> 01:59:58.655]  Every injection had HIV and at least two different forms of hepatitis.
[01:59:59.156 --> 02:00:04.959]  And their own documents said they knowingly for a decade shipped that out and it killed hundreds of thousands in the U.S.
[02:00:05.019 --> 02:00:05.379]  alone.
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:10.082]  So my point is these people are eugenicists.
[02:00:10.602 --> 02:00:11.983]  People ask, how could they do this?
[02:00:12.003 --> 02:00:13.504]  They believe killing us is good.
[02:00:14.004 --> 02:00:16.606]  So once you believe that, then they carry it out.
[02:00:17.406 --> 02:00:22.269]  And SV40 has been found not just in the polio shots but in a bunch of other vaccines.
[02:00:23.763 --> 02:00:38.270]  We know in the AIDS program and hepatitis shots that they gave a vector in New York, the gay community, because they had over 100 partners a year, the HIV in the 70s, we know it's a bioweapons program, so yes.
[02:00:40.391 --> 02:00:48.515]  Wow, that's interesting, because I had always been an avid supporter of getting your flu shots every year, but my son and my wife said, hey, we're not going to take them anymore, and then
[02:00:49.085 --> 02:00:54.168]  I listen to your show, so I have a whole different attitude about it now.
[02:00:54.228 --> 02:00:55.089]  Well, don't believe me.
[02:00:55.209 --> 02:00:58.551]  Okay, this is very important, Charles, from San Diego.
[02:00:59.551 --> 02:01:09.837]  What you need to do is you need to Google studies show flu shots increase Alzheimer's, or flu shots increase in Alzheimer's.
[02:01:10.478 --> 02:01:17.322]  And there are scores of studies that when you take multiple flu shots, especially when you're older, it is associated with the...
[02:01:18.266 --> 02:01:18.406]  Wow.
[02:01:18.426 --> 02:01:20.027]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:01:20.047 --> 02:01:21.108]  I really appreciate it.
[02:01:21.128 --> 02:01:22.289]  Thank you.
[02:01:22.309 --> 02:01:25.411]  I mean, it takes some coming to terms with this.
[02:01:46.207 --> 02:01:49.188]  They know chlorine massively increases cancer.
[02:01:49.228 --> 02:01:53.789]  I mean, it's as bad as smoking for your lungs, for your kidneys and bladder.
[02:01:55.069 --> 02:01:57.330]  In fact, in many studies it's worse, statistically.
[02:01:58.350 --> 02:02:00.550]  They know cell phones give you brain tumors.
[02:02:01.151 --> 02:02:11.353]  They know, and they knew when they put them out, that Prozac serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors massively increase psychotic breaks and suicide.
[02:02:11.593 --> 02:02:13.113]  Now we force them to put it on the bottle.
[02:02:14.174 --> 02:02:15.694]  Oxymoron, it's antidepressant.
[02:02:17.042 --> 02:02:19.204]  It causes you to kill yourself and be depressed.
[02:02:20.505 --> 02:02:27.691]  They know sodium fluoride reduces IQ and brain damage issues and attacks every major organ in the body and causes calcification in the arteries.
[02:02:29.813 --> 02:02:30.994]  They know everything.
[02:02:31.774 --> 02:02:33.135]  They did it on purpose.
[02:02:33.796 --> 02:02:35.878]  These are the sickest control freaks you can imagine.
[02:02:36.538 --> 02:02:39.661]  It's power for them to hurt you, to hurt me, to hurt us.
[02:02:46.204 --> 02:02:47.885]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[02:02:48.185 --> 02:02:51.666]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:02:51.826 --> 02:02:53.706]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:02:53.726 --> 02:02:57.027]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:02:57.347 --> 02:03:02.829]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[02:03:03.129 --> 02:03:07.050]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:04:17.070 --> 02:04:17.711]  We're good to go.
[02:04:46.255 --> 02:04:46.535]  Fact.
[02:04:46.716 --> 02:04:52.641]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:04:52.761 --> 02:04:57.005]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:04:57.105 --> 02:05:04.592]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:05:04.872 --> 02:05:18.821]  The Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[02:05:18.941 --> 02:05:26.947]  Detoxification works with the Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.

[02:05:55.738 --> 02:05:58.259]  I always love the different directions your calls take us.
[02:05:58.279 --> 02:06:01.080]  Let's do that again right now as we spin the Wheel of Fortune.
[02:06:02.801 --> 02:06:04.982]  Jeremiah in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:06:05.122 --> 02:06:05.702]  Thanks for holding.
[02:06:06.623 --> 02:06:09.104]  Yeah, I think we're coming spring and summer.
[02:06:09.664 --> 02:06:14.286]  We should have, like, tons of protests going on for, like, the summer and springtime.
[02:06:14.306 --> 02:06:21.189]  Like, we're having the protests on April 15th against the Fed, and I think we should have a protest against gas for one day.
[02:06:21.269 --> 02:06:22.290]  We should try our best.
[02:06:23.550 --> 02:06:24.391]  A protest against gas?
[02:06:25.836 --> 02:06:28.997]  Yeah, just try not to buy gas for one day.
[02:06:31.298 --> 02:06:34.699]  Yeah, the problem is, you know, the Patriot community is big, but not that big.
[02:06:34.979 --> 02:06:39.381]  We've had those don't buy gas things before, and it really is ineffectual.
[02:06:39.421 --> 02:06:42.302]  I think the key is just keep waking people up, keep having demonstrations.
[02:06:42.742 --> 02:06:44.683]  It's not even about the media or the people singing.
[02:06:44.723 --> 02:06:46.003]  It's about us getting together.
[02:06:47.064 --> 02:06:48.204]  But all of it's a good idea.
[02:06:49.076 --> 02:06:51.137]  I mean, look at gas prices right now.
[02:06:51.277 --> 02:06:53.539]  Record all-time highs, and they say it's just the beginning.
[02:06:53.959 --> 02:06:59.642]  Well, we told you three years ago Bilderberg was going to do this, and, you know, they're the bosses, so we have molds inside.
[02:06:59.662 --> 02:07:00.523]  We can tell you what's going to happen.
[02:07:01.603 --> 02:07:14.091]  Well, just keep on, like, as, like, everybody in the Patriot community, like, everyone, like, in the meetups and stuff around the country, just go around their community and just, like, spread the word around, spread the word around, having people come to their side.
[02:07:14.131 --> 02:07:18.133]  Just tell the truth to the people who are still asleep and stuff.
[02:07:19.571 --> 02:07:20.212]  Absolutely.
[02:07:20.352 --> 02:07:21.512]  It's life and death, folks.
[02:07:22.233 --> 02:07:23.174]  I appreciate your call.
[02:07:24.194 --> 02:07:24.995]  It's life and death.
[02:07:27.056 --> 02:07:27.957]  It's all life and death.
[02:07:28.858 --> 02:07:30.739]  Fish can't live in the tap water you drink.
[02:07:30.779 --> 02:07:31.900]  I mean, that life and death right there.
[02:07:32.981 --> 02:07:33.561]  It's killing us.
[02:07:34.842 --> 02:07:37.764]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:07:38.564 --> 02:07:40.486]  Kyle in Iowa, you're on the air.
[02:07:41.787 --> 02:07:42.667]  Alex, how's it going?
[02:07:42.968 --> 02:07:43.808]  Pretty good, my friend.
[02:07:44.309 --> 02:07:44.829]  Hey, um...
[02:07:46.212 --> 02:07:50.153]  I noticed that no one has put out a documentary, so I went ahead and did it myself.
[02:07:51.534 --> 02:08:04.857]  The documentary I made, it's called Media Propaganda and the 2008 Election, and it kind of breaks everything down in a problem-reaction-solution format, kind of fighting fire with fire, except this is actual...
[02:08:07.822 --> 02:08:12.344]  Honesty instead of trying to spin people with lies, and it's kind of a blatant Ron Paul piece also.
[02:08:12.584 --> 02:08:13.524]  Sure, good.
[02:08:13.604 --> 02:08:14.385]  I wanted to plug that.
[02:08:14.425 --> 02:08:18.726]  It's on Google Video, and I've got it on public access.
[02:08:18.987 --> 02:08:24.109]  I've made a couple others myself just because I have a creative streak, but that's the main one that no one else has touched.
[02:08:24.129 --> 02:08:26.310]  The other ones have already been kind of done before.
[02:08:26.450 --> 02:08:27.150]  Look, what?
[02:08:27.210 --> 02:08:30.391]  I mean, millions of people making mini-docs and full-length docs.
[02:08:30.871 --> 02:08:31.952]  It's educating the world.
[02:08:32.012 --> 02:08:33.052]  It's turning the corner.
[02:08:33.092 --> 02:08:33.913]  It's turning the tide.
[02:08:33.973 --> 02:08:34.473]  I salute you.
[02:08:35.819 --> 02:08:44.903]  Yeah, and that's essentially what I did, was I took a bunch of mini-documentaries and edited all those together, so I mean, I really can't even take a whole lot of credit for it.
[02:08:45.203 --> 02:08:47.284]  It isn't even about the credit, it's about survival.
[02:08:47.864 --> 02:09:00.290]  Right, exactly, and I could care less, but it really breaks down who the candidates are, who control them, how they control the media, and how the media actually brainwashes us, and then obviously it's
[02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:05.742]  It shows them also... How many... Well, I guess Google doesn't show how many views you've gotten anymore.
[02:09:05.762 --> 02:09:06.583]  YouTube still does.
[02:09:06.603 --> 02:09:07.623]  But how many views have you gotten?
[02:09:07.643 --> 02:09:10.565]  You know, honestly, I haven't even checked.
[02:09:10.685 --> 02:09:11.465]  I haven't even checked.
[02:09:11.505 --> 02:09:14.207]  So I guess that's something I should do.
[02:09:14.267 --> 02:09:17.308]  But I would assume maybe after I'm off of this show, maybe I'll get a couple more.
[02:09:17.348 --> 02:09:18.549]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[02:09:18.569 --> 02:09:21.130]  I don't even care about that besides for my own... You know what I mean?
[02:09:21.570 --> 02:09:22.471]  I know, but it's good to gauge.
[02:09:22.511 --> 02:09:23.251]  I appreciate the call.
[02:09:23.271 --> 02:09:23.751]  Keep it up.
[02:09:25.952 --> 02:09:28.774]  You know, somebody could take ten minutes of my local TV show we put on prisonplanet.tv.
[02:09:30.275 --> 02:09:30.895]  And high quality.
[02:09:30.915 --> 02:09:32.496]  That's why you want to see it at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:09:32.916 --> 02:09:42.518]  And people add all this video to it and all these documents, and they put it up on the web, and just on YouTube in like two days alone, 210,000 people watch it.
[02:09:43.478 --> 02:09:49.519]  And then you see it all over Google and all over everything else with hundreds of thousands of views all stacking up.
[02:09:50.339 --> 02:09:51.780]  That probably took somebody an hour to do.
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:53.580]  Two hours.
[02:09:55.321 --> 02:09:57.241]  I mean, the globalists cannot counter that.
[02:09:59.656 --> 02:10:01.396]  They cannot counter it.
[02:10:04.337 --> 02:10:10.438]  When I sit there and say, you know, government studies show Florida reduces IQ, then they show the government study and where it's from right there on the screen.
[02:10:12.959 --> 02:10:16.739]  It's also a good exercise for you to listen to me and then go check out every word I say.
[02:10:16.759 --> 02:10:27.061]  Instead of sitting there in your squad car giggling and snickering and eating a honey bun or whatever you're doing, I mean, you need to go find out I'm telling you the truth, okay?
[02:10:28.062 --> 02:10:29.562]  I want you to go check into what I'm saying
[02:10:32.546 --> 02:10:34.668]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:10:35.148 --> 02:10:36.449]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:10:37.330 --> 02:10:44.335]  It's not just fluoride that destroys the thyroid gland, it's also chlorine and bromine that they use in pools.
[02:10:44.375 --> 02:10:50.619]  So the solution is, the only solution I know of is to use ozone, get an ozonated pool.
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:54.702]  And also you're saying that we need to have... Well, let me stop you, sir.
[02:10:54.762 --> 02:10:55.223]  Let me stop you.
[02:10:55.243 --> 02:10:56.163]  Your phone's real bad.
[02:10:56.263 --> 02:10:57.104]  Are you on a Skype phone?
[02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:58.811]  No, I'm sorry about that.
[02:10:58.831 --> 02:11:00.072]  It's just a bad cell phone.
[02:11:00.152 --> 02:11:01.493]  Okay, well, I mean, let me know.
[02:11:02.013 --> 02:11:02.413]  Don't hang up.
[02:11:02.453 --> 02:11:03.434]  Let me just add something here.
[02:11:03.854 --> 02:11:05.736]  We're not saying don't swim in your swimming pool.
[02:11:06.216 --> 02:11:08.898]  We're saying you're drinking, basically, what's in your swimming pool.
[02:11:08.938 --> 02:11:09.238]  Go ahead.
[02:11:10.079 --> 02:11:10.279]  Right.
[02:11:10.359 --> 02:11:12.221]  I don't swim in any swimming pools.
[02:11:12.601 --> 02:11:14.522]  I haven't found one that's ozonated, so I can't.
[02:11:15.183 --> 02:11:23.809]  And also, you're saying that a high-fat diet is good, and that's true, but it's really the omega-3s that are the common American diet is deficient.
[02:11:23.849 --> 02:11:24.390]  Yeah, the fish oil.
[02:11:25.453 --> 02:11:27.996]  Right, we have an overabundance of the omega-6 and 9.
[02:11:28.796 --> 02:11:36.864]  Now, the hemp seed oil, well, I had been taking fish oil, and then I started on hemp seed oil, and I noticed my skin was a lot smoother, and my thinking was a lot better.
[02:11:37.205 --> 02:11:40.608]  I don't know of any studies on hemp seed oil, but I know it's worked well for me.
[02:11:40.628 --> 02:11:46.774]  It has all the, doesn't it have threes, sixes?
[02:11:46.874 --> 02:11:49.356]  It's the only plant that we know of that...
[02:11:50.993 --> 02:11:54.875]  The only land plant that has the correct balance of omega-3, 6, and 9.
[02:11:55.035 --> 02:11:58.616]  And by the way, it has no THC in it for people out there snickering.
[02:11:59.336 --> 02:11:59.696]  Right.
[02:11:59.736 --> 02:12:03.758]  That's why it has to be imported from Canada, and we can't grow it in this country.
[02:12:04.898 --> 02:12:17.343]  Otherwise, it would be a very therapeutic... It's a much better filler for cakes and cereals and things than all of the toxic corn and GMO stuff we're eating.
[02:12:18.038 --> 02:12:19.119]  Yep.
[02:12:19.219 --> 02:12:32.868]  Also, when it comes to the shortage of gold or silver and the coming depression, apparently, what would you say about converting our paper into coins, like having rolls of quarters, dimes, and nickels?
[02:12:33.588 --> 02:12:45.997]  And what do you think about making the point to abolish the Fed or federalizing the Federal Reserve, going to constitutional money, and making the emotional point that that would allow us to
[02:12:46.556 --> 02:12:53.037]  Well, there are arguments against going back to a solid gold or silver-backed currency because the globalists own most of that and it could corner the market again.
[02:12:53.057 --> 02:12:56.338]  People argue against Ron Paul, but he wants to phase that in
[02:13:11.221 --> 02:13:22.288]  And basically monetize the debt, and the federal government could do that, and we're so deep in the hole, you couldn't go back to a solid gold currency immediately, and there are several different plans to do that.
[02:13:22.368 --> 02:13:24.950]  Regardless, we've got to get off the Federal Reserve System.
[02:13:25.010 --> 02:13:33.435]  They have used their power to create endless dollars, buy the world up through their corporations that they literally gave the money to.
[02:13:33.895 --> 02:13:38.418]  Now they're going to blow out the banks, but they've already transferred their assets and leave us holding the bag.
[02:13:40.009 --> 02:13:57.257]  And when it comes to the heirloom seeds or the genetically modified seeds, Terminator seeds, what would you say, would you please, wouldn't you agree that we need to boycott the factory farmers like Tyson, Cargo, Hormel, Swift, Purdue?
[02:13:57.317 --> 02:13:57.977]  Yeah, I never.
[02:13:58.077 --> 02:13:59.438]  I mean, probably for 10 years.
[02:13:59.458 --> 02:14:00.658]  I do not buy Tyson.
[02:14:00.698 --> 02:14:01.739]  I do not buy Hormel.
[02:14:02.939 --> 02:14:07.021]  I, you know, pay twice as much to, you know, get something from a local farm
[02:14:07.931 --> 02:14:09.772]  And absolutely, it's life and death.
[02:14:09.792 --> 02:14:11.532]  They're trying to shut down the farms everywhere.
[02:14:11.912 --> 02:14:12.732]  They started failing.
[02:14:12.752 --> 02:14:15.093]  That's why they have the Animal ID and Premises ID Act now.
[02:14:15.113 --> 02:14:16.513]  It even came out in Congress.
[02:14:16.573 --> 02:14:18.094]  It's meant to shut down the family farm.
[02:14:19.214 --> 02:14:23.095]  Again, the big banks, the big money use regulators to shut down their competition.
[02:14:23.155 --> 02:14:23.935]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:24.696 --> 02:14:25.896]  Yeah, this is life and death, folks.
[02:14:25.916 --> 02:14:30.597]  This is a global monopoly they're setting up to wage war against humanity.
[02:14:30.837 --> 02:14:32.818]  I mean, I read the chairman of the CFR.
[02:14:34.392 --> 02:14:47.083]  Excuse me, the president of the CFR, Richard N. Haas, in a public document saying they want to destroy the United States and bring in a world government and quote that humanity is the enemy.
[02:14:48.564 --> 02:14:51.567]  Okay, I read those and gave you where you could get them yesterday.
[02:14:51.927 --> 02:14:53.909]  They publicly write that.
[02:14:54.269 --> 02:14:56.471]  Do you understand?
[02:14:59.213 --> 02:15:00.855]  That's what's so amazing about this.
[02:15:01.698 --> 02:15:05.460]  But a lot of you have been preconditioned that none of this exists or you won't look into it.
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:07.121]  Just look into it.
[02:15:07.921 --> 02:15:09.062]  Question your reality.
[02:15:11.723 --> 02:15:13.124]  Lou and Mass, you're on the air.
[02:15:15.225 --> 02:15:15.485]  Hi.
[02:15:15.705 --> 02:15:16.605]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:15:16.786 --> 02:15:17.046]  Good.
[02:15:17.886 --> 02:15:23.789]  Hey, I've got a couple of things that I wanted to talk about.
[02:15:23.809 --> 02:15:27.411]  The first one is basically anybody can watch any film or video.
[02:15:30.638 --> 02:15:50.912]  Yeah, hundreds of movies, TV shows, I mean, literally most of them, you're right, I wouldn't say all, the government staging terror attacks, video games, it's all about that, and that's a big question I had a few months ago.
[02:15:51.032 --> 02:15:54.575]  Why suddenly, everywhere, are they putting this in plots?
[02:15:55.441 --> 02:15:58.742]  Well, I think the concept, it's a basic human behavior.
[02:15:58.762 --> 02:16:05.163]  And I think it goes into, like, you know, nurses poisoning patients to be the hero, to go back and save them.
[02:16:05.903 --> 02:16:08.644]  And it's kind of the same type of mentality.
[02:16:08.844 --> 02:16:10.244]  What's that mental illness called?
[02:16:10.364 --> 02:16:11.404]  It's got a term.
[02:16:13.945 --> 02:16:14.625]  The something.
[02:16:15.105 --> 02:16:16.025]  It'll pop my head.
[02:16:16.165 --> 02:16:17.206]  Is it Munchausen or something?
[02:16:17.286 --> 02:16:19.226]  Munchausen, yeah, Munchausen, that's it.
[02:16:21.284 --> 02:16:38.874]  Yeah, and the other thing I wanted to talk about, too, was the NBC report had a report on the news on Monday night, I think it was, and they were talking about mercury shots and how they were affecting people and they were triggering preconditioned things and things that you've been talking about for a while.
[02:16:38.894 --> 02:16:39.595]  Which is pure bull.
[02:16:39.655 --> 02:16:40.775]  It's not preconditioned.
[02:16:41.656 --> 02:16:46.919]  Other than boys, the vast majority, it's like 80-plus percent, pull the studies up,
[02:16:47.569 --> 02:16:51.217]  Have a blood-brain-intestine-blood barrier.
[02:16:51.237 --> 02:16:54.163]  It's the same type membrane around the brain that's also in the intestines.
[02:16:55.130 --> 02:16:55.711]  We're good to go.
[02:16:55.731 --> 02:16:56.231]  We're good to go.
[02:17:25.510 --> 02:17:32.935]  Even if they don't have the recessive gene to have that particular mucosa, whatever it is, it's a complex membrane, not an activation.
[02:17:32.955 --> 02:17:33.795]  I don't want to get into it.
[02:17:33.815 --> 02:17:34.656]  Just go look it over for yourself.
[02:17:35.236 --> 02:17:35.997]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:17:36.017 --> 02:17:37.838]  Actually, one last thing.
[02:17:37.898 --> 02:17:38.218]  Stay there.
[02:17:38.238 --> 02:17:38.978]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:39.539 --> 02:17:45.342]  GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:46.623 --> 02:17:48.024]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:49.104 --> 02:17:50.085]  A new world order.
[02:17:50.848 --> 02:17:56.030]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:57.531]  It's known as the Builderberg.
[02:17:58.551 --> 02:18:00.792]  Was their objective being world domination?
[02:18:01.352 --> 02:18:03.793]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.534 --> 02:18:11.957]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:14.878 --> 02:18:19.840]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:23.804]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:24.184 --> 02:18:26.686]  Bill Burr is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:18:26.767 --> 02:18:27.928]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:27.948 --> 02:18:28.688]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.708 --> 02:18:29.789]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:29.970 --> 02:18:30.730]  They're after power.
[02:18:30.971 --> 02:18:31.992]  That's what they have to do.

[02:21:50.134 --> 02:21:51.655]  This show is documented.
[02:21:52.195 --> 02:21:55.497]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.838 --> 02:21:58.359]  Lou, finish up what you were going to say.
[02:21:59.566 --> 02:22:05.047]  I got basically a recruitment letter with a survey that I received.
[02:22:05.107 --> 02:22:13.969]  It basically asked me to join an emergency medical response, actually the Medical Reserve Corps.
[02:22:14.469 --> 02:22:16.669]  And I'm going to read you a little verbatim here.
[02:22:16.829 --> 02:22:26.251]  The ability to respond to the new challenges that faces us in this post-9-11 world rests with our ability to motivate our citizens to sign up, train, and be credentialed before disaster strikes.
[02:22:26.850 --> 02:22:30.046]  Basically, they want us to volunteer for
[02:22:31.416 --> 02:22:38.883]  Yeah, send me a copy of that, but let me give you the background.
[02:22:38.903 --> 02:22:39.623]  You're a pretty smart guy.
[02:22:39.643 --> 02:22:41.665]  You probably already know this.
[02:22:41.685 --> 02:22:44.027]  In 2002, they ordered 14,000 first responders.
[02:22:44.067 --> 02:22:47.290]  Police, firemen, sheriff's deputies, all nurses, all doctors.
[02:22:47.310 --> 02:22:51.173]  Remember, they just said, you must take the smallpox shot.
[02:22:51.573 --> 02:22:53.115]  You must take the anthrax shot.
[02:22:53.555 --> 02:22:55.597]  You must prepare for forced inoculations.
[02:22:55.657 --> 02:22:58.940]  And I had sheriffs and police chiefs and fire chiefs who said no.
[02:23:00.470 --> 02:23:02.332]  I talked to Austin cops and said no way.
[02:23:02.392 --> 02:23:04.113]  The Austin Police Union said no.
[02:23:04.894 --> 02:23:10.878]  And literally, the LA Times reported that 99 plus percent of 14 million said no.
[02:23:10.898 --> 02:23:14.161]  4,000 said yes.
[02:23:14.321 --> 02:23:16.383]  A bunch of them died from the smallpox shot.
[02:23:16.423 --> 02:23:17.363]  It made them have heart attacks.
[02:23:17.844 --> 02:23:18.544]  That was in the news.
[02:23:18.584 --> 02:23:19.405]  Go look it up, folks.
[02:23:20.606 --> 02:23:22.287]  And so they had to go more covert.
[02:23:22.367 --> 02:23:26.951]  So they hire you or get you to volunteer, and it sounds reasonable for hurricanes and stuff like that.
[02:23:26.971 --> 02:23:34.517]  But then when you actually go into the training, they then vet you out to ask you questions and then take larger cadres basically for martial law.
[02:23:35.177 --> 02:23:38.960]  Just like when they first get the military to merge with the local police, it's hazmat.
[02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:39.961]  Sounds real reasonable.
[02:23:40.281 --> 02:23:49.408]  Two years later, it's checkpoints and roundup training and how to have the cops with the military drive city buses around mass arresting people.
[02:23:49.998 --> 02:23:52.421]  So, see, everything they do sounds reasonable.
[02:23:52.601 --> 02:23:57.466]  It's all run by top psychological warfare experts that know how to manipulate good people.
[02:23:58.387 --> 02:24:05.636]  I had to go back about three stages in my Internet research to find out actually who was at the core of this, and it was very interesting.
[02:24:05.776 --> 02:24:07.297]  Oh, tell us who you found out was at the core of it.
[02:24:07.778 --> 02:24:08.879]  Homeland Security?
[02:24:08.939 --> 02:24:10.020]  The federal government, of course.
[02:24:12.572 --> 02:24:14.293]  But it was advertised as a local thing?
[02:24:14.313 --> 02:24:15.714]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:24:15.734 --> 02:24:21.317]  You know, it started out locally, so I went back and I hit one website, and then I followed a link to another website.
[02:24:21.357 --> 02:24:26.460]  Basically, all you have to do is just do a little research and go back and find out who's at the top.
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:27.100]  Appreciate your info.
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:31.703]  You ought to write a blurb for us and scan the letter in, and we'll post it on InfoWars.com.
[02:24:31.723 --> 02:24:32.663]  We need you to contribute.
[02:24:32.683 --> 02:24:35.145]  We need you to post it on the Prison Planet message board.
[02:24:35.165 --> 02:24:40.708]  Email us a copy so we can put it on the main page, but at least it will be on the message board getting millions of reads a month.
[02:24:42.424 --> 02:24:44.665]  There's so many... Again, it sounds reasonable.
[02:24:44.745 --> 02:24:46.726]  I'm all for a civil air corps.
[02:24:46.786 --> 02:24:48.206]  I'm all for civil defense.
[02:24:49.527 --> 02:24:51.728]  But that in the past was centered around real threats.
[02:24:52.408 --> 02:24:56.809]  Now you get into it and you find out it's for gun confiscation and the rest of it.
[02:24:56.849 --> 02:24:59.030]  I mean, I'm all for the citizens being involved with the government.
[02:25:00.111 --> 02:25:01.451]  The local and state government.
[02:25:02.171 --> 02:25:07.033]  But when you find out again... Like if you were against Hitler, they'd say you were against the German military.
[02:25:07.133 --> 02:25:08.393]  No, you were against Hitler.
[02:25:08.894 --> 02:25:09.914]  Not against the military.
[02:25:10.908 --> 02:25:14.981]  Just like I'm against what our military is being turned into...
[02:25:16.189 --> 02:25:16.590]  Right now.
[02:25:16.610 --> 02:25:20.753]  We're going to break and come back with a guest dealing with these FBI databases and a lot more.
[02:25:20.773 --> 02:25:21.794]  You'll want to stay with us for that.
[02:25:22.215 --> 02:25:24.517]  But first off, folks, I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
[02:25:25.118 --> 02:25:30.523]  We have to store food for our families if we're going to stay free and stay alive if emergencies or crises come.
[02:25:30.963 --> 02:25:41.313]  With all this depression talk, martial law talk, regardless, this is an insurance policy that's high quality, that you can eat, that you will eat, that you will use whether bad things come or not.
[02:25:42.051 --> 02:25:43.654]  Food prices exploding, the rest of it.
[02:25:43.674 --> 02:25:45.257]  This is high-quality foods.
[02:25:45.818 --> 02:25:48.122]  Stores very easily, very inexpensive.
[02:25:48.911 --> 02:26:01.796]  This is the national leader in it, the longest continually operating, the J. Michael Stevens Group, efoodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com, big banners at the top of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, or give them a call today.
[02:26:01.876 --> 02:26:02.416]  Don't wait.
[02:26:02.436 --> 02:26:03.196]  1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.
[02:26:03.216 --> 02:26:04.176]  They are just fabulous, fabulous people.
[02:26:15.505 --> 02:26:19.148]  And they just have incredible quality products.
[02:26:19.228 --> 02:26:21.330]  This is where I just got more storable food last week from them.
[02:26:23.652 --> 02:26:28.896]  Also, there's livefreenow.org, the Freedom Law School's 2008 Justice, Peace, and Freedom Conference.
[02:26:29.436 --> 02:26:32.719]  It's coming to Irvine, California, March 28th to the 31st.
[02:26:33.439 --> 02:26:35.141]  How to prosper in the coming hard times.
[02:26:35.221 --> 02:26:37.002]  Is the income tax really a giant fraud?
[02:26:37.383 --> 02:26:38.303]  What is the purpose of the U.S.
[02:26:38.343 --> 02:26:38.984]  Constitution?
[02:26:40.382 --> 02:26:43.263]  Do you know what your God-given constitutional rights are?
[02:26:43.784 --> 02:26:48.426]  What really happened on 9-11 here at Strait from several survivors of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks?
[02:26:48.466 --> 02:26:57.590]  William Rodriguez, Jason Bermas, G. Edward Griffin, David Kleist, Tommy Cryer, Paymon, Joe Bannister, Larry Becraft, Michael Collins-Piper, and many, many more.
[02:26:58.607 --> 02:26:59.468]  Call and register.
[02:26:59.508 --> 02:27:00.709]  Call and get your tickets now.
[02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:02.872]  Coming up the 28th to the 31st.
[02:27:02.892 --> 02:27:03.292]  760-868-4271.
[02:27:03.312 --> 02:27:03.532]  760-868-4271.
[02:27:03.572 --> 02:27:14.184]  Don't forget, you can get three months free right now by signing up at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:27:14.544 --> 02:27:16.506]  Download all my films in super high quality.
[02:27:16.547 --> 02:27:17.187]  Get them on disc.
[02:27:17.588 --> 02:27:18.368]  Get them out to people.
[02:27:18.729 --> 02:27:20.271]  And we're also carrying a three...
[02:27:21.161 --> 02:27:22.482]  A two-film, one CD.
[02:27:22.502 --> 02:27:26.945]  It's two different films and an audio CD for 1995, the GMO Trilogy.
[02:27:27.545 --> 02:27:29.746]  You will totally understand what's happening.
[02:27:29.826 --> 02:27:32.648]  Why genetically modified organisms threaten your health and the environment.
[02:27:33.489 --> 02:27:35.190]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[02:27:36.651 --> 02:27:37.571]  We're on the march.
[02:27:38.032 --> 02:27:39.653]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.573 --> 02:27:43.275]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.283 --> 02:27:48.144]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[02:27:48.344 --> 02:27:51.405]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:27:51.645 --> 02:27:56.267]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:27:56.607 --> 02:27:59.228]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:27:59.488 --> 02:28:06.351]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:28:06.551 --> 02:28:12.274]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:28:12.554 --> 02:28:14.254]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[02:28:14.675 --> 02:28:15.535]  SFR works
[02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.870]  We're good to go.
[02:28:46.770 --> 02:28:55.494]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:28:55.694 --> 02:29:00.477]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:29:00.737 --> 02:29:11.862]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[02:29:12.162 --> 02:29:17.703]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.923 --> 02:29:24.005]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.205 --> 02:29:24.845]  What about you?
[02:29:25.125 --> 02:29:27.025]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[02:29:27.045 --> 02:29:31.166]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[02:29:31.346 --> 02:29:33.046]  Call Jeff and order now by calling 562-544-0507.
[02:29:33.066 --> 02:29:33.667]  That's Jeff at 562-544-0507.
[02:29:40.808 --> 02:29:46.973]  Find hidden cameras wherever you go with the small handheld spy finder and locate hidden transmitters with one of our bug detectors.
[02:30:03.505 --> 02:30:04.246]  We're good to go.
[02:30:18.402 --> 02:30:21.504]  Use promotional code GCN007 and receive a 5% discount when ordering online.
[02:30:21.564 --> 02:30:23.825]  Spyville.com, where your personal security and well-being is our goal.
[02:30:56.021 --> 02:31:15.448]  All right, there's so many facets to this that we've got you an expert just for one segment, about 15 minutes.
[02:31:16.628 --> 02:31:24.311]  But just to set the table, some universities have switched over to where about half their curriculum is for Homeland Security and Anti-Terror,
[02:31:24.972 --> 02:31:35.257]  The national average I've seen is close to 10%, whether it's in law enforcement or homeland security or data mining or the insurance companies are in on it, databases for everything.
[02:31:36.378 --> 02:31:43.642]  There's a shift of our economy where the military-industrial complex is basically making us some type of new spy zone.
[02:31:44.202 --> 02:31:46.143]  And you know about AT&T and the spying.
[02:31:46.663 --> 02:31:47.744]  There's so much to this.
[02:31:48.556 --> 02:31:55.680]  And I remember six months ago when we interviewed some of them, one of the head federal marshals said, I'm not doing this, and a bunch of them complained they'd been doing it privately.
[02:31:55.901 --> 02:32:02.785]  They're ordered every month to put a bunch of innocent people on a database for what they order or taking photos or anything in the airport.
[02:32:03.225 --> 02:32:04.686]  They said totally innocent people.
[02:32:05.066 --> 02:32:09.409]  There's coming up on a million people in the terror watch list database.
[02:32:09.549 --> 02:32:10.109]  A million.
[02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:15.933]  I mean, even if you have a real terror threat, that hurts things because everybody's a terrorist.
[02:32:16.233 --> 02:32:17.454]  You're busy looking for...
[02:32:18.348 --> 02:32:21.873]  The FBI training manuals say look for a woman with a baby carriage, a priest.
[02:32:23.035 --> 02:32:25.919]  They claim there's thousands of blonde-haired, blue-eyed Al-Qaeda.
[02:32:25.939 --> 02:32:27.401]  That was a report two weeks ago.
[02:32:27.421 --> 02:32:28.863]  It's ridiculous.
[02:32:29.925 --> 02:32:30.065]  And...
[02:32:32.080 --> 02:32:34.722]  So joining us is former award-winning New York Times journalist.
[02:32:35.123 --> 02:32:46.873]  He is the co-director of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a team of researchers analyzing and analysts at Syracuse University have been tracking FBI activity and domestic crime investigations.
[02:32:47.153 --> 02:32:52.437]  The results are revealing, and we are joined by David Burnham.
[02:32:52.678 --> 02:32:54.279]  David, thanks for coming on.
[02:32:54.779 --> 02:32:55.620]  You've got the floor.
[02:32:55.660 --> 02:32:56.421]  Tell us what's happening.
[02:32:56.835 --> 02:32:57.435]  Thank you, sir.
[02:32:58.656 --> 02:33:00.477]  Well, you summarized who we are.
[02:33:00.757 --> 02:33:01.918]  We're part of a university.
[02:33:02.058 --> 02:33:06.760]  We get data out of the Justice Department under the Freedom of Information Act.
[02:33:06.800 --> 02:33:08.041]  We get millions of records.
[02:33:09.282 --> 02:33:13.884]  And my partner, the other co-director, is a PhD statistician, and we analyze it.
[02:33:15.045 --> 02:33:19.287]  And we look at what the government's doing and not what they say they're doing.
[02:33:20.508 --> 02:33:20.648]  And...
[02:33:22.409 --> 02:33:23.490]  The typical sentence was 41 months.
[02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:24.711]  Those numbers are startling.
[02:33:53.583 --> 02:34:02.306]  And suggests, and this happens, I've covered cops for years, that they sort of just went out and rounded up the usual suspects.
[02:34:02.506 --> 02:34:02.927]  28 days?
[02:34:04.927 --> 02:34:09.689]  So the question that gives you is, is that effective?
[02:34:09.729 --> 02:34:10.329]  Does it work?
[02:34:10.349 --> 02:34:11.550]  Because, you know, we're all scared.
[02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:13.931]  And is it fair?
[02:34:14.051 --> 02:34:17.092]  I mean, are people being abused by
[02:34:18.716 --> 02:34:46.941]  The raw is picking up everybody charging them and then you know letting them walk with 28 days so More recently we put up this report and you interrupt me here when you want to bust in because I want to get your side of this We put up a report looking at enforcement by the federal government During the last 20 years and a bunch of agencies
[02:34:48.044 --> 02:34:57.006]  Including the FBI and the Secret Service, which does a lot of white-collar crime, and the Postal Service and the IRS.
[02:35:00.007 --> 02:35:02.268]  Their enforcement is way down, all of them.
[02:35:02.588 --> 02:35:04.488]  We should have given up on white-collar crime.
[02:35:05.808 --> 02:35:07.649]  In fact, you've got some numbers on that.
[02:35:07.809 --> 02:35:16.211]  What percentage is now anti-terror, looking for terrorists under every closet bush, versus white-collar crime, bank robberies, things like that?
[02:35:17.435 --> 02:35:24.980]  Well, the raw numbers now are not so startling if you look at it that way.
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:38.407]  But what I can tell you is, you know, the FBI is down 51% on all kinds of crime.
[02:35:38.427 --> 02:35:38.407]  51%.
[02:35:39.207 --> 02:35:42.149]  That's the rate of the number of prosecutions.
[02:35:42.779 --> 02:35:46.680]  But they've radically expanded the number of agents and clerks and assistants.
[02:35:47.180 --> 02:35:47.860]  Right, they have.
[02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:54.541]  And Mr. Mueller says, well, that's because we're fighting terrorism.
[02:35:55.702 --> 02:36:00.303]  And it's just hard, but there's no way, we don't know what that is.
[02:36:01.083 --> 02:36:01.923]  That's all secret.
[02:36:03.423 --> 02:36:10.305]  And there have been periods in our history, you know, going back some years, where...
[02:36:12.606 --> 02:36:22.950]  The FBI sort of got carried away on this concern about national security, and they really got out of hand.
[02:36:23.010 --> 02:36:41.237]  Now, I'm not saying, I think Mr. Mueller strikes me as a good guy, but they've moved all a bunch of agents from white-collar crime, official corruption, you know, that kind of stuff,
[02:36:41.761 --> 02:36:46.342]  And they put them into something that's called terrorism, and we don't know what they're doing.
[02:36:47.442 --> 02:36:52.544]  Well, we do know, to a certain extent, it's creating FBI files on hundreds of thousands more citizens.
[02:36:52.564 --> 02:36:53.904]  It's spying on peace groups.
[02:36:55.064 --> 02:36:57.525]  It's engaging in secret police-type activities.
[02:36:58.385 --> 02:37:02.486]  And so it's shifting over more into, from what I've seen, more of a Stasi type.
[02:37:02.846 --> 02:37:06.287]  I saw one newspaper headline, Crime Busters Turned Snoopers.
[02:37:07.333 --> 02:37:13.536]  And it says, a team of researchers and analysts at Syracuse University has been tracking the FBI's activity in domestic crime investigations.
[02:37:13.576 --> 02:37:17.318]  The results are revealing, for example, in 2007, the FBI made 2,300 referrals of cases to be prosecuted at the U.S.
[02:37:17.378 --> 02:37:17.798]  Justice Department.
[02:37:17.818 --> 02:37:18.938]  In 1993, the FBI made 20,900 such referrals.
[02:37:19.339 --> 02:37:20.499]  So we're down from 20,900 to 2,300.
[02:37:20.539 --> 02:37:21.520]  I mean, look, not just federal.
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:39.324]  You get your car stolen now in Austin, the police won't come out, but they're everywhere lined up giving you tickets.
[02:37:40.846 --> 02:37:42.307]  Your office gets broken into.
[02:37:42.367 --> 02:37:43.308]  They won't even come.
[02:37:43.988 --> 02:37:45.249]  You can have 50 grand gone.
[02:37:45.729 --> 02:37:47.571]  There's no real investigation anymore.
[02:37:47.631 --> 02:38:01.101]  It's just giving tickets and feeding and arresting people at protests and saying there's no right to videotape and putting cameras... I mean, calling it what it is, they're shifting over into more of a commissariat.
[02:38:01.842 --> 02:38:03.083]  Well, that's
[02:38:04.376 --> 02:38:09.300]  You know, getting the evidence of the commissariat part takes time because it's all classified.
[02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:13.482]  I wrote a book on the Justice Department, and that certainly has happened in the past.
[02:38:14.143 --> 02:38:18.326]  We don't have, you know, memos and all that at this moment.
[02:38:18.606 --> 02:38:20.687]  We can guess that may be going on.
[02:38:20.747 --> 02:38:25.750]  We see some evidence of it, but I have to be cautious.
[02:38:27.272 --> 02:38:27.452]  Sure.
[02:38:28.251 --> 02:38:29.291]  What about InfraGard?
[02:38:29.331 --> 02:38:30.312]  What about InfraGard?
[02:38:30.392 --> 02:38:38.314]  I mean, 23,000 executives with shoot to kill, and the FBI comes out and clarifies and says, well, that's not an extraordinary power.
[02:38:38.334 --> 02:38:41.855]  That's an amazing, that was an amazing story.
[02:38:44.456 --> 02:38:45.757]  That was an amazing story.
[02:38:46.037 --> 02:38:52.519]  And, you know, the IRS is sort of giving up on tax enforcement.
[02:38:53.827 --> 02:38:54.848]  Who else is going to do it?
[02:38:54.928 --> 02:38:58.732]  I mean, you know, the local cops aren't going to do tax enforcement or white-collar crime.
[02:38:59.653 --> 02:39:08.281]  And there is something, you know, I mean, Mr. Mueller, we have reason to be concerned that there are people out there who might want to do us damage, and you've got to pay attention.
[02:39:08.821 --> 02:39:19.331]  But it doesn't seem to me paying mindful attention if you, you know, round up a whole bunch of people with very little evidence, and in the end you let most of them go.
[02:39:20.294 --> 02:39:24.657]  And you end up with a sentence of 28 days for those you convicted.
[02:39:24.677 --> 02:39:28.459]  Well, they've had very few real terror convictions in association with 9-11.
[02:39:28.499 --> 02:39:32.742]  What is it, one conviction in association with 9-11, and now they're going to have secret trials?
[02:39:32.962 --> 02:39:33.603]  Very few.
[02:39:34.403 --> 02:39:34.964]  Very few.
[02:39:35.264 --> 02:39:47.472]  And that is, as somebody who's written about what happened in the United States, actually right after World War I, right after World War II...
[02:39:48.992 --> 02:39:52.434]  When the sort of Roundup business went on.
[02:39:52.614 --> 02:39:53.774]  Trading with the Enemy Act.
[02:39:54.155 --> 02:39:54.415]  Yeah.
[02:39:55.715 --> 02:40:00.638]  And, well, you know, if you go back to John Adams, he had a... Sedition.
[02:40:00.978 --> 02:40:01.418]  Sedition.
[02:40:01.498 --> 02:40:02.539]  Alien and Sedition Acts.
[02:40:02.779 --> 02:40:02.899]  And...
[02:40:03.789 --> 02:40:11.493]  I mean, during his administration, 17 newspaper men were arrested and put in jail for seditious behavior.
[02:40:11.533 --> 02:40:17.376]  Well, have you heard Limbaugh and Michael Savage calling for people to disagree with the war to be arrested?
[02:40:17.396 --> 02:40:18.016]  You haven't heard that?
[02:40:18.637 --> 02:40:19.357]  I have.
[02:40:19.497 --> 02:40:21.378]  I don't hang on to Limbaugh's every word.
[02:40:21.798 --> 02:40:24.840]  No, no, I mean, I don't expect you to, but I mean... No, no, no.
[02:40:24.900 --> 02:40:25.661]  I haven't heard that.
[02:40:25.961 --> 02:40:29.423]  I mean, literally, well, Savage more than... That's all he talks about.
[02:40:29.823 --> 02:40:36.347]  He's published the Sedition Act and the Trading with the Enemy and says it's patriotic that we need to start arresting Americans.
[02:40:38.368 --> 02:40:41.430]  So, the data are very interesting.
[02:40:41.971 --> 02:40:46.293]  I hope you don't mind this, but your listeners, if they go to trac.syr.edu...
[02:40:52.029 --> 02:40:53.410]  This is free, this is nothing.
[02:40:53.511 --> 02:40:54.431]  Oh, I don't mind that, sir.
[02:40:54.451 --> 02:40:55.112]  I want you to plug it.
[02:40:55.152 --> 02:40:55.812]  Say it slowly.
[02:40:56.233 --> 02:41:02.218]  Okay, trac.syr.edu.
[02:41:02.378 --> 02:41:03.599]  Yeah, go over more of the data.
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:05.661]  What we have up there?
[02:41:06.161 --> 02:41:10.305]  Yeah, I mean, explain what this means, that the main thing the FBI does now is secret.
[02:41:10.325 --> 02:41:11.206]  They're just creeping around.
[02:41:11.626 --> 02:41:11.786]  Right.
[02:41:12.086 --> 02:41:12.567]  Break that down.
[02:41:14.744 --> 02:41:22.088]  Just go to track.syr.edu and click on Track Reports, which is an icon, and you'll see the report there and you can read it yourself.
[02:41:23.048 --> 02:41:30.612]  And we're having, just for the record, we're having an awful time getting the data.
[02:41:31.132 --> 02:41:33.013]  This administration is worse.
[02:41:33.954 --> 02:41:38.216]  No administration likes people looking over their shoulder, but this administration is worse.
[02:41:38.976 --> 02:41:44.258]  ...than any since the passage of the Freedom of Information Act 40 years ago.
[02:41:45.278 --> 02:42:06.624]  And we have a suit going in federal district court against the IRS, a suit going against two branches of the Justice Department, two suits in the Justice Department, another suit going against the Office of Personnel Management, which is where you get information about federal employees, and...
[02:42:09.186 --> 02:42:23.812]  And we get pro bono lawyers, but it's hard work, and it takes away from the serious analysis like this report I just pointed your listeners to at track, T-R-A-C dot S-Y-R dot E-D-U.
[02:42:23.972 --> 02:42:32.336]  Well, sir, you've been tracking the Justice Department, writing about them for years in the New York Times now as one of the co-research directors of this big project.
[02:42:33.096 --> 02:42:34.156]  I mean, overall...
[02:42:36.408 --> 02:42:37.829]  We do know what they're doing.
[02:42:38.009 --> 02:42:47.596]  They're shifting a huge apparatus from fighting crime over into secret operations, and we know from their underlings what it is.
[02:42:47.696 --> 02:42:53.040]  I mean, you saw the Air Marshal reports where they're just ordered to put innocent people on lists, and they don't like it.
[02:42:54.081 --> 02:42:54.401]  I know.
[02:42:55.722 --> 02:42:58.504]  And presumably there are a lot of people in the FBI.
[02:42:58.524 --> 02:43:04.769]  I hope there are people in the FBI who don't like what they're doing, but they haven't started talking to the newspaper people very much yet.
[02:43:05.481 --> 02:43:19.468]  I mean, imagine having your job where you run around harassing peace groups and creating files on talk show hosts, and then a woman takes a snapshot of her child in Denver Airport, and so for the rest of her life she's a terrorist on a database?
[02:43:19.668 --> 02:43:20.208]  Yep.
[02:43:22.730 --> 02:43:35.136]  I have a report the FBI did on me for Hoover back a few years ago saying I was unreliable and a scumbag and everything bad, and I have it framed.
[02:43:35.658 --> 02:43:36.338]  I have it framed.
[02:43:37.359 --> 02:43:38.739]  Why did they think you were a scumbag?
[02:43:39.539 --> 02:43:45.061]  Well, I wrote a thing... I wrote a big police scandal story in New York.
[02:43:46.942 --> 02:43:49.102]  There was a movie about an aspect, Serpico.
[02:43:49.823 --> 02:43:51.303]  Oh, wow.
[02:43:51.323 --> 02:43:53.444]  I ought to have you on about that sometime.
[02:43:54.144 --> 02:43:59.006]  And, you know, New York City... New York's police department was very, very, very corrupt.
[02:43:59.426 --> 02:44:00.906]  And Serpico helped bring it out.
[02:44:01.066 --> 02:44:02.687]  And I worked on that for seven years.
[02:44:03.662 --> 02:44:05.363]  And that made them mad?
[02:44:05.763 --> 02:44:05.963]  Yep.
[02:44:06.303 --> 02:44:08.023]  Because I was attacking law enforcement.
[02:44:08.484 --> 02:44:13.485]  Well, wait, that ended in more than two-thirds of the narcotics force being fired.
[02:44:13.925 --> 02:44:14.165]  Right.
[02:44:14.405 --> 02:44:19.447]  I mean, there was unbelievable corruption in the NYPD in that period.
[02:44:20.287 --> 02:44:22.008]  And then you're bad because you exposed that.
[02:44:22.268 --> 02:44:22.428]  Yep.
[02:44:23.194 --> 02:44:25.715]  Well, I mean, if we let the government become that corrupt, it's going to fall.
[02:44:25.835 --> 02:44:27.055]  I mean, well, what do they want us to do?
[02:44:27.115 --> 02:44:28.035]  Just let them do anything?
[02:44:28.675 --> 02:44:29.736]  Well, that's where we've got to fight.
[02:44:29.876 --> 02:44:42.219]  And the point of track is to give the public and public interest groups, you know, the ACLU gets our data, and actually the National Rifle Association used our data.
[02:44:42.239 --> 02:44:49.141]  During the Clinton years, right around the time the high school kids were shooting people, enforcement...
[02:44:49.873 --> 02:44:55.800]  Weapons enforcement by the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms went down 41%.
[02:44:55.881 --> 02:45:00.687]  Now, shifting gears into the different aspects, we know...
[02:45:01.602 --> 02:45:03.824]  A lot about what the FBI is doing.
[02:45:03.864 --> 02:45:09.587]  I mean, you say in their documents most of it's secret, but it comes out that they've said they're going to be more like the CIA.
[02:45:09.928 --> 02:45:14.471]  They're working with the CIA in major cities, which is illegal, by the way, as liaisons.
[02:45:15.391 --> 02:45:17.533]  They're working with the military.
[02:45:17.553 --> 02:45:23.917]  I mean, there's this PDD 51 where Bush says he's above Congress in emergencies.
[02:45:24.297 --> 02:45:26.199]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[02:45:26.259 --> 02:45:31.302]  I mean, we get an idea of, I mean, I know we don't know how deep the pond is, but it's a pretty big pond.
[02:45:31.762 --> 02:45:36.785]  Yeah, well, Lee, Mueller, the head of the FBI, has actually talked about this some on the record.
[02:45:36.885 --> 02:45:43.270]  And what he says is essentially he doesn't quite put the spin you just put on it, but it's close.
[02:45:43.370 --> 02:45:51.255]  I mean, he says we put a huge amount of our resources into this terrorism thing.
[02:45:51.695 --> 02:45:56.878]  Matter of fact, we have one of our studies looks at budgets.
[02:45:58.159 --> 02:45:58.319]  And
[02:46:01.082 --> 02:46:03.964]  We compare ten years ago with today.
[02:46:04.004 --> 02:46:04.624]  We have budgets.
[02:46:05.705 --> 02:46:16.871]  And ten years ago, two out of three FBI dollars was for white-collar crime enforcement, official corruption, that kind of thing.
[02:46:17.872 --> 02:46:20.814]  Today, only one out of three dollars is for that.
[02:46:22.274 --> 02:46:25.396]  Now, you know, official corruption is watching government corruption.
[02:46:25.716 --> 02:46:28.498]  The government cuts back, watching itself.
[02:46:28.538 --> 02:46:29.679]  Boy, that's a red flag.
[02:46:29.819 --> 02:46:30.039]  Right.
[02:46:30.940 --> 02:46:31.760]  And you cut back.
[02:46:32.020 --> 02:46:34.561]  Well, you know, I think it's a concern.
[02:46:36.121 --> 02:46:36.681]  I really do.
[02:46:37.801 --> 02:46:38.582]  But I interrupted you.
[02:46:38.622 --> 02:46:41.182]  Back then, it was two out of three dollars was for that.
[02:46:41.242 --> 02:46:41.982]  Now how much is it?
[02:46:42.302 --> 02:46:43.023]  One out of three.
[02:46:44.743 --> 02:46:49.324]  So it's gone from one-third, gone from two-thirds down to one-thirds.
[02:46:49.964 --> 02:46:52.745]  I guess that's where reading your study, I got the two-thirds number.
[02:46:52.785 --> 02:46:55.145]  I was saying that it's flipped.
[02:46:55.865 --> 02:46:56.065]  Wow.
[02:46:56.405 --> 02:46:56.865]  Oh, man.
[02:46:57.486 --> 02:46:58.026]  Yeah, it's good.
[02:47:01.415 --> 02:47:07.016]  And the only way we can fight this is to know about it and be informed.
[02:47:12.338 --> 02:47:26.021]  Senator Leahy is a subscriber to our service, and he uses it in his hearings and to ask questions of the Bush administration Justice Department.
[02:47:27.348 --> 02:47:41.892]  And the thing is, they don't have the... The congressmen and the newspaper reporters don't have the time and the energy and the skills to get the data and sort it out the way we do.
[02:47:41.992 --> 02:47:43.433]  Oh, it's an ocean.
[02:47:43.453 --> 02:47:44.673]  Yeah, it is.
[02:47:45.213 --> 02:47:50.755]  It's a huge... We've got hundreds of thousands... You know, we did a big study on immigration...
[02:47:53.868 --> 02:48:03.875]  The way immigration judges were using, were deciding cases where people asked for asylum.
[02:48:04.856 --> 02:48:13.222]  And there were a bunch of judges who denied 95% or more of the request.
[02:48:14.302 --> 02:48:14.623]  Amazing.
[02:48:15.403 --> 02:48:19.146]  And then there were a bunch of judges who approved almost all.
[02:48:19.753 --> 02:48:25.014]  Well, listen, we're going to get a link up to your great research division up on our website, sir.
[02:48:25.094 --> 02:48:30.096]  And I'd like to get you back up sometime for maybe 30 minutes to talk about Serpica, since you work so much on that.
[02:48:30.536 --> 02:48:31.256]  Yeah, I'd love to.
[02:48:31.276 --> 02:48:31.616]  Thank you.
[02:48:31.836 --> 02:48:33.156]  Okay, we'll call you in the next few weeks.
[02:48:33.216 --> 02:48:35.317]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:48:35.357 --> 02:48:37.277]  There goes David Burnham.
[02:48:37.317 --> 02:48:37.817]  Thank you, sir.
[02:48:38.938 --> 02:48:41.898]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, final segment, final news straight ahead.
[02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:47.740]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.903 --> 02:48:49.964]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.665 --> 02:48:54.929]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:48:55.569 --> 02:48:57.331]  It's known as the Builderberg.
[02:48:58.392 --> 02:49:00.654]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.195 --> 02:49:03.577]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.355 --> 02:49:11.780]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.702 --> 02:49:19.666]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.166 --> 02:49:20.866]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:20.906 --> 02:49:21.806]  They're not after money.
[02:49:21.846 --> 02:49:23.087]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:23.107 --> 02:49:24.427]  They're after power.
[02:49:24.447 --> 02:49:25.547]  That's what happens.
[02:49:45.387 --> 02:49:46.027]  It's a fact.
[02:49:46.247 --> 02:49:53.728]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:49:53.849 --> 02:50:02.710]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:50:02.990 --> 02:50:13.512]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:50:13.792 --> 02:50:19.856]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:50:20.076 --> 02:50:25.079]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:50:25.279 --> 02:50:29.761]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[02:50:29.921 --> 02:50:31.722]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.

[02:50:50.096 --> 02:50:54.997]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[02:54:22.153 --> 02:54:27.738]  Man, I should have spent hours on this, because it's just every facet is so important.
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:33.483]  Tomorrow I'm going to spend some time on this, but we've got some big guests coming up the next few days, by the way.
[02:54:34.654 --> 02:54:37.480]  Parents may be jailed over vaccinations, AP.
[02:54:37.841 --> 02:54:38.983]  They ran this all over the U.S.
[02:54:39.003 --> 02:54:39.704]  to scare us.
[02:54:40.045 --> 02:54:42.771]  People will just see it on the coffee table at work and think it's the law.
[02:54:43.392 --> 02:54:44.334]  No, this is in Europe.
[02:54:45.715 --> 02:54:51.900]  As doctors struggle to eradicate polio, and all over the world they give them polio shots down, everybody dies of polio or gets sick.
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:54.242]  They've been caught all over adding it to it.
[02:54:54.282 --> 02:55:01.888]  But as doctors struggle, not the doctors, the companies, struggle to eradicate polio worldwide, one of their biggest problems is persuading parents to vaccinate their children.
[02:55:02.208 --> 02:55:06.131]  And Belgium authorities are resorting to an extreme measure, prison sentences.
[02:55:06.171 --> 02:55:08.333]  See, the government's going to force something in your body.
[02:55:09.153 --> 02:55:09.554]  Oh, boy.
[02:55:10.234 --> 02:55:12.556]  Two sets of parents in Belgium were recently...
[02:55:13.504 --> 02:55:17.786]  Handed five-month prison terms for failing to vaccinate their children against polio.
[02:55:17.846 --> 02:55:20.888]  Each parent was also fined 4,100 euros.
[02:55:21.608 --> 02:55:28.811]  It is a pretty extraordinary case, said Dr. Ross Upshur, director of the Joint Center for Bioethics at the University of Toronto.
[02:55:29.391 --> 02:55:30.292]  See, they decide.
[02:55:30.612 --> 02:55:31.352]  It's not a court.
[02:55:31.573 --> 02:55:33.393]  It's just the bioethicists.
[02:55:33.413 --> 02:55:34.154]  They're the new gods.
[02:55:35.274 --> 02:55:38.896]  The Belgians have a right to take some action against the parents, given the seriousness of polio.
[02:55:40.319 --> 02:55:42.240]  By the way, they... It's incredible.
[02:55:42.260 --> 02:55:47.402]  The parents can also avoid prison if they go ahead and give their children the shots.
[02:55:48.622 --> 02:55:49.443]  And it goes on.
[02:55:49.523 --> 02:55:50.203]  It's just sick.
[02:55:50.623 --> 02:55:53.204]  They want to do that here and force all sorts of stuff into you.
[02:55:56.545 --> 02:56:03.148]  The only other case of mandatory polio vaccines in the world is in the Muslim yearly Hajj in Saudi Arabia.
[02:56:04.929 --> 02:56:07.790]  And they make them take it.
[02:56:08.422 --> 02:56:13.024]  Now, they won't take it to Afghanistan, India, and other places, Nigeria, Pakistan, because they know they're poisoning them with it.
[02:56:14.184 --> 02:56:15.525]  These people are hardcore killers.
[02:56:15.565 --> 02:56:19.786]  And by the way, all polio vaccine has SV40, not just the old stuff.
[02:56:20.126 --> 02:56:23.567]  It's a virulent cancer that generally eats your brain.
[02:56:23.587 --> 02:56:24.768]  We'll see you tomorrow live.
[02:56:24.788 --> 02:56:25.188]  God bless.
