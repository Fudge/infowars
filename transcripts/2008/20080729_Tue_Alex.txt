[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:00.869]  We're good to go.
[00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:32.001]  For the next hour and 15 minutes, roughly, we'll be joined by Webster Griffin Tarbly.
[00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:38.903]  He wrote the first major definitive work, unauthorized biography, back in the early 90s on George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:44.345]  I have researched everything in that book and followed up and did even expanded research with more modern information.
[00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:47.586]  In my film in 2004, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State,
[00:00:52.308 --> 00:01:01.111]  When BBC and then others after that did report indeed that Prescott Bush was the head Nazi in the United States.
[00:01:02.252 --> 00:01:05.473]  And I really respect Webster Tarpoli's fine work.
[00:01:05.493 --> 00:01:06.953]  Of course, his book covers more than just that.
[00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.175]  It's now, of course, still in print.
[00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.115]  He also has a free version up on the web at his website.
[00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:19.018]  The new book, Obama, the Postmodern Coup, is a very interesting book and I certainly
[00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:26.784]  Respect Webster Griffin Tarpley's perspective and view on that, and I think it's important to read this book.
[00:01:26.804 --> 00:01:29.426]  That's why we're offering it almost out of print.
[00:01:29.447 --> 00:01:32.449]  The second edition is about to come out, but we have just a few hundred of these.
[00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.830]  I believe it's publishers now sold out.
[00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:37.353]  We have some of the only copies of this at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:39.916]  Obama and the Postmodern Coup, Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:01:41.217 --> 00:01:46.001]  That said, I want to not just discuss Barack Obama's background and the time we have.
[00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:46.561]  We're going to do that
[00:01:47.402 --> 00:01:48.362]  But I suggest you get the book.
[00:01:48.883 --> 00:01:51.583]  But also, at a certain point it becomes academic.
[00:01:52.164 --> 00:01:54.524]  I mean, Hillary represents the exact same people.
[00:01:55.525 --> 00:02:01.547]  John McCain now has Zbigniew Brzezinski's son advising it on foreign policy.
[00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:02.827]  That was in the Associated Press.
[00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:04.667]  We got a lot of calls about that.
[00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:05.768]  Thank listeners for pointing it out.
[00:02:07.386 --> 00:02:15.712]  Now, at least on the surface, they have kicked Zbigniew Brzezinski off of his foreign policy advisory panel, Barack Obama's, but it doesn't matter.
[00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:23.657]  The whole same crew, as Dartley points out, that wants to attack Russia, that wants to attack other countries in Central Asia,
[00:02:24.554 --> 00:02:28.317]  That wants to move nuclear weapons back into Europe and point them at the Russians.
[00:02:28.717 --> 00:02:29.918]  I mean, everything he's saying is true.
[00:02:30.058 --> 00:02:32.560]  My only difference is perspective on this.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:45.089]  It almost lends credibility to the whole election process when you're talking about Barack Obama versus Hillary and now it's Barack Obama versus John McCain.
[00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.610]  I mean, it's a foregone conclusion.
[00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.434]  It's like a Don King fight where he owns both the fighters and you know it's going to be rigged.
[00:02:52.314 --> 00:03:05.721]  Either way, and then you've got all these neocons on Fox saying, oh, Israel is going to attack before the election to get John McCain elected.
[00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:07.101]  I don't know if that's the case.
[00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:07.922]  I want to get Tarpley.
[00:03:08.882 --> 00:03:09.562]  Take on that.
[00:03:09.842 --> 00:03:13.244]  Tarpley is quite a geopolitical expert.
[00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:14.924]  His research is very good.
[00:03:15.464 --> 00:03:21.366]  I constantly study and read and research and find that Tarpley's information is again very accurate.
[00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:27.148]  I only differ with you, Webster, on the inferences you draw on the
[00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:29.729]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.070]  Two years ago, I was saying we weren't going to attack Iran then.
[00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.970]  You were saying guaranteed with dates.
[00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:41.693]  And so I think we can argue about how we analyze that data and what we come up with.
[00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:46.134]  And so, I think you get the point I'm making here, Webster?
[00:03:47.034 --> 00:03:47.534]  Yes, Alex.
[00:03:47.574 --> 00:03:49.315]  First of all, let me thank you for inviting me.
[00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:51.075]  Thank you for stocking my book.
[00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:54.436]  And I'm delighted to have this discussion.
[00:03:55.526 --> 00:03:58.832]  I would say, first of all, we have to look at ourselves like a naval battle.
[00:03:59.112 --> 00:04:06.606]  We're confronting a hostile fleet, and you've got to concentrate your fire on the flagship of the hostile fleet rather than just scattering fire.
[00:04:07.242 --> 00:04:16.787]  In every direction, and I think if you turn on the television for ten minutes, there is no doubt that Obama is the candidate favored by the controlled corporate media.
[00:04:16.807 --> 00:04:17.987]  Yes, he is anointed.
[00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:24.791]  It is an endless worship fest, and I watched him in Europe quite a bit over the weekend on C-SPAN Raw footage.
[00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:28.733]  He is a... He is bumbling.
[00:04:28.773 --> 00:04:30.094]  He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:04:30.114 --> 00:04:36.417]  I know a lot of high school seniors in government class that can speak more eloquently than him, and that is upsetting to me.
[00:04:36.974 --> 00:04:53.248]  You're exactly right, but the choice that's being made is of course being made by Wall Street, and it's being made by our old friends, the Trilateral, Rockefeller, Bilderberger, Council on Foreign Relations, Rand Corporation, Chicago Schools, Skull and Bones, Ford Foundation, you name it.
[00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:56.992]  They have all lined up behind Obama in a way that is unprecedented.
[00:04:57.032 --> 00:05:00.415]  You've got a unified oligarchical front now around Obama.
[00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:02.634]  McCain is barely mentioned.
[00:05:02.914 --> 00:05:04.595]  Hillary Clinton was swept aside.
[00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:05.675]  Others swept aside.
[00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:11.878]  An example is McCain lands in New Hampshire and there's one reporter and one photographer.
[00:05:12.738 --> 00:05:14.319]  Everywhere Obama goes, thousands.
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.880]  Now, you're exactly right.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.841]  And there's a reason for this.
[00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:19.481]  Why do they support Obama?
[00:05:19.521 --> 00:05:20.462]  What's the reason?
[00:05:20.902 --> 00:05:24.424]  It is because he is the puppet who is most puppet.
[00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:27.385]  He's like Bush, who they know they can fully control.
[00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:30.169]  Yes, maybe even more so than Bush.
[00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:35.230]  He's somebody who's been raised literally up out of nothing by these trilateral people.
[00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:42.173]  My personal hypothesis is that Obama was recruited by Zbigniew Brzezinski at Columbia University between 1981
[00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:47.307]  And 1983, they had just finished up with Carter.
[00:05:47.407 --> 00:05:52.928]  You'll remember that Zbigniew Brzezinski and Volker ran the catastrophic Carter administration.
[00:05:52.988 --> 00:05:55.188]  And then they pinned it all on him when he was well-meaning.
[00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.610]  Yes, and that's also an aspect of why they've chosen Obama, because Obama's not well-meaning.
[00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.410]  Obama is a boiling cauldron of hate.
[00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:11.712]  But back there in Colombia in 81 to 83, they were looking around for a puppet, a Manchurian candidate, assets, and of course they had a broad choice.
[00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:14.332]  Didn't have to be just Obama, they picked others.
[00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:44.270]  uh... to to deploy into a uh... political upsurge in this country uh... approximately now two thousand and eight two thousand and ten two thousand and twenty and obama was one of the political properties that they picked up so they have been grooming him and indoctrinating him by the way i'm backing you up dr dennis cuddy has done a whole book on all these famous people when they're in college they'll be in the lunch line and david rockefeller will be there are some big numbers and she'll be there henry kissinger they go pick who they want
[00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:56.703]  And that, I think, that is my thesis, is that that's what happened with Obama, and therefore all the wonderful coincidences and magic events of his life are guided by that fine trilateral hand behind the scenes.
[00:06:57.063 --> 00:06:58.984]  But now, ultimately, why do they need him today?
[00:06:59.264 --> 00:07:00.245]  Basically two things.
[00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:07.108]  The entire phase of Islamofascism, war on terror, post 9-11, I believe is exhausted.
[00:07:07.508 --> 00:07:09.149]  I think they've gone into a new phase.
[00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.471]  The fake environmental Malthusian, the Russians are a threat.
[00:07:13.052 --> 00:07:21.956]  Yes, it's Russia, China, Malthusian, Unabomber kind of stuff, but then it's also human rights, humanitarian concerns, and left cover.
[00:07:22.237 --> 00:07:27.559]  We're going from a phase of right-wing cover imperialism to a phase of left-wing cover imperialism.
[00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:34.083]  This is why so many of our left-liberal friends have not been able to understand this, because they regard all of this as progress.
[00:07:34.123 --> 00:07:34.783]  They think that it's
[00:07:38.285 --> 00:07:42.749]  By the way, the Romans would do this in their different protectorates and new places they'd taken over.
[00:07:43.049 --> 00:07:58.960]  They would put a thug in for 5-10 years to murder, kill, stab, then they would publicly flog him, execute him, apologize, and then rise up somebody from that local area in Germania or Gaul or there in
[00:07:59.801 --> 00:07:59.981]  Excellent!
[00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:02.904]  And in the case of Brzezinski, you can say this is the Hegelian dialectic.
[00:08:02.944 --> 00:08:06.727]  This is one of those cases where you can actually see the Hegelian dialectic at work.
[00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:24.813]  Brzezinski's teacher is a guy called Carl Friedrichs.
[00:08:24.953 --> 00:08:27.215]  So he has a degree in Hegelian Dialectic?
[00:08:27.496 --> 00:08:29.217]  Yes, and Friedrichs is a historian.
[00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:30.478]  He wrote The Age of the Baroque.
[00:08:30.498 --> 00:08:32.800]  He's a historian of the Thirty Years' War.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.782]  As a professor of the Hegelian Dialectic?
[00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:40.487]  Yeah, and Brzezinski is a student at McGill University with this guy and, of course, with others.
[00:08:41.048 --> 00:08:45.291]  And essentially what they've said is, you can't keep going with the right-wing stuff.
[00:08:45.331 --> 00:08:47.153]  You can't do Bush-Cheney neocons.
[00:08:47.512 --> 00:08:50.534]  Right now here in Washington, Bush, Cheney, and the Neocons are finished.
[00:08:50.634 --> 00:08:51.094]  They're out.
[00:08:51.214 --> 00:08:52.095]  They have no influence.
[00:08:52.155 --> 00:08:53.095]  They're a laughingstock.
[00:08:53.396 --> 00:08:54.236]  They're going to jail.
[00:08:55.497 --> 00:08:55.977]  They're done.
[00:08:56.357 --> 00:08:59.599]  And their policies are out too, and we could go through that in some detail.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.721]  But the idea is now, what's the new policy?
[00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:05.603]  The Brzezinski argument is, stop wasting time in the Middle East.
[00:09:05.843 --> 00:09:07.924]  Stop mucking around in the Persian Gulf.
[00:09:08.325 --> 00:09:11.707]  Remember that on a world scale, the main opposition to U.S.
[00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:14.729]  imperialism is Russia and China.
[00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:16.950]  It's the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
[00:09:17.324 --> 00:09:27.271]  You smash those, you've guaranteed U.S.-British world domination for another century, so get busy doing that, and forget the attack on Iran.
[00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:29.012]  I believe there will be no attack on Iran.
[00:09:29.352 --> 00:09:31.854]  There have been ultimatums delivered to the Israelis.
[00:09:31.954 --> 00:09:34.196]  Well, why did you previously believe that there would be?
[00:09:34.776 --> 00:09:39.860]  I think we came very close, and the closest we came was last August with the Rogue B-52.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.163]  There was an attempt by the Cheney gang last August to actually hijack
[00:09:44.742 --> 00:09:46.963]  A B-52 intercontinental bomber.
[00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.225]  They flew it from North Dakota to Louisiana.
[00:09:50.285 --> 00:09:51.846]  They were going to fly that to the Middle East.
[00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:54.387]  And it had six cruise missiles on it, loaded with nukes.
[00:09:54.807 --> 00:09:58.889]  And this was going to take part in the attack on Israel that took place on September 6th.
[00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:03.091]  However, it was stopped on the ground and as that question went up the chain of command,
[00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:05.717]  And began to interest the intelligence agencies.
[00:10:06.057 --> 00:10:09.639]  The word came down, no, no, no, no, no!
[00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:12.320]  And that, I believe, that was the last gasp from Bush and Cheney.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:18.163]  And then we see a string of reports by the CIA and Defense Intelligence saying it's all lies, Iran's not a threat.
[00:10:19.084 --> 00:10:22.285]  But you're saying you don't think Israel's going to wildcard?
[00:10:22.305 --> 00:10:25.047]  Because they're certainly setting up the propaganda front right now.
[00:10:25.067 --> 00:10:27.028]  No, I think a lot of that is disinformation.
[00:10:27.068 --> 00:10:29.709]  The attack that you have to worry about that's going on right now
[00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:34.831]  There's another country, three times bigger than Iran, with nuclear weapons that is being attacked.
[00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:35.652]  Pakistan!
[00:10:36.192 --> 00:10:42.115]  It's Pakistan, and I believe there will be a U.S., uh, NATO and Afghan land invasion of northwest Pakistan.
[00:10:42.155 --> 00:10:46.597]  Now, the difference, though, is there's a different... And they've been downlighting, they've been preparing the ground on that.
[00:10:47.537 --> 00:10:57.882]  The, the difference is that now the target list is, how do you weaken Russia, how do you weaken China, how do you strip away Chinese allies and Chinese strategic partners?
[00:10:57.942 --> 00:10:58.282]  That means
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.421]  Pakistan is at the top of the list.
[00:11:00.822 --> 00:11:07.467]  Not for this idiotic al-Qaeda bin Laden fairytale that we've already refuted and you've refuted so many times.
[00:11:07.907 --> 00:11:09.688]  But now it's the question of Pakistan.
[00:11:09.728 --> 00:11:12.090]  Yeah, that's just a rubric, boogeyman cover.
[00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:12.790]  I agree.
[00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:18.815]  But the real reason is that Pakistan is an ally of China, and that's what they've got to go after.
[00:11:18.875 --> 00:11:22.778]  The gold of the operations out of Afghanistan right now is the Chinese encirclement.
[00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.133]  Yeah, it's to encircle China by destroying Pakistan.
[00:11:26.193 --> 00:11:29.557]  In other words, by dividing Pakistan into four, five, six countries.
[00:11:29.618 --> 00:11:33.883]  Be it Balochistan, Pushtunistan, Waziristan, Sindh, or whatever you have.
[00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:35.865]  They're going to shatter Pakistan.
[00:11:35.905 --> 00:11:36.826]  Same thing in Iraq.
[00:11:36.866 --> 00:11:38.148]  They want to break it in three parts.
[00:11:38.168 --> 00:11:38.748]  That's why they won't.
[00:11:39.369 --> 00:11:41.110]  Let Maliki kick him out, do you agree with that?
[00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:47.192]  Yes, that's the Bernard Lewis plan, and that of course goes on and on, but now the Bernard Lewis plan is... Stay there, stay there.
[00:11:47.212 --> 00:11:48.672]  Yeah, the great game, balkanization.
[00:11:49.012 --> 00:11:50.873]  Webster will be right back in about four minutes.
[00:11:50.893 --> 00:11:53.314]  We're going to cover a host of issues with our guest.
[00:11:53.334 --> 00:11:53.774]  Stay with us.
[00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:56.595]  He's the author of The Obama Postmodern Coup.
[00:11:56.775 --> 00:12:00.396]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:12:00.716 --> 00:12:04.218]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[00:12:04.518 --> 00:12:05.398]  Midas Resources.
[00:12:09.189 --> 00:12:09.850]  We're good to go.

[00:12:57.316 --> 00:13:02.799]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:04.339]  And we knew what to do.
[00:13:04.359 --> 00:13:06.140]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:12.783]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:13:13.404 --> 00:13:20.107]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[00:13:20.796 --> 00:13:21.936]  We're safe to breathe.
[00:13:22.296 --> 00:13:29.098]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:13:29.398 --> 00:13:32.459]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:37.801]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:13:38.341 --> 00:13:40.942]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:13:50.572 --> 00:13:52.353]  We don't expose the government-sponsored terror.
[00:13:52.774 --> 00:13:55.376]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:13:58.218 --> 00:14:03.962]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:09.926]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high stress lifestyles.
[00:14:10.247 --> 00:14:14.110]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.312]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by
[00:14:17.332 --> 00:14:17.992]  We're good to go!

[00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:05.523]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:15:05.823 --> 00:15:12.311]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:14.814]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.

[00:15:23.382 --> 00:15:27.065]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:15:27.325 --> 00:15:28.847]  Travel less, meet online.

[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:03.562]  Man thinks, cause he rules at us, he can do with it as he please.
[00:16:05.049 --> 00:16:32.009]  And if things don't change soon He will For a man has invented his doom First step was touching the moon Now there's a woman on my block She'll just sit there as the night grows still She'll say, who's gonna take away his license
[00:16:33.266 --> 00:16:35.147]  Obama, the post-modern coup.
[00:16:39.009 --> 00:16:59.200]  Look, the reason I saw the elite, the Fox News type people having fundraisers for her quietly, Rush Limbaugh trying to make sure that she won, really pushing for that, as the major power structure of the neocons being behind Hillary.
[00:17:01.272 --> 00:17:04.216]  And I said that she was going to be the person that won.
[00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:06.940]  I said five years ago you'd hear Limbaugh endorse her.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.582]  I was right about them endorsing her.
[00:17:08.682 --> 00:17:10.364]  I was wrong about her winning.
[00:17:11.005 --> 00:17:14.149]  Just like Tarpley was wrong about them attacking Iran a year and a half ago, two years ago.
[00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.531]  But none of us are perfect.
[00:17:16.092 --> 00:17:18.173]  The point here is I don't claim to have all the answers.
[00:17:18.233 --> 00:17:18.934]  I just know this.
[00:17:19.534 --> 00:17:26.539]  To hold Hillary out and to say, well, we're attacking the main capital ship here in the Infowar, I just say it's all a latrine.
[00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:32.502]  There are all different things floating around in there and I'm not going to say go for either one of them because it's that lesser of evils thing.
[00:17:32.943 --> 00:17:33.763]  It just doesn't matter.
[00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.124]  Discredit the whole process.
[00:17:35.504 --> 00:17:36.605]  That's what brings them down.
[00:17:36.645 --> 00:17:39.107]  Discredit them all is what we've got to do.
[00:17:41.629 --> 00:17:44.752]  But now we've got Obama, we've got McCain, so we're analyzing that.
[00:17:45.713 --> 00:17:46.754]  We are looking at that.
[00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:54.121]  I mean, you're not denying, Webster, that Hillary would have been a willing servant of the very elite running Obama today, are you?
[00:17:54.742 --> 00:17:56.523]  Willing, but not as willing as Obama.
[00:17:56.703 --> 00:17:58.205]  Not 100% a slave.
[00:17:58.305 --> 00:18:00.427]  Maybe 50%, 70% a slave.
[00:18:00.507 --> 00:18:03.850]  After all, she's got a two-term president in the House.
[00:18:04.787 --> 00:18:10.108]  She does not owe her entire existence to Big New Brzezinski in the way that Obama does.
[00:18:10.288 --> 00:18:14.509]  Obama is 1,000% a puppet, a total abject slave.
[00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:17.149]  What do you say to Brzezinski's people being in the McCain campaign now?
[00:18:17.609 --> 00:18:18.229]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:18:18.269 --> 00:18:19.470]  Brzezinski's a clever fellow.
[00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:23.350]  He's got one Democratic son, Mark, who's on the Obama side.
[00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.011]  And by the way, Brzezinski continues to run Obama.
[00:18:26.051 --> 00:18:27.191]  This is just window dressing.
[00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:31.932]  Brzezinski learned under Carter that he's Dr. Strangelove and he better stay out of the TV.
[00:18:32.492 --> 00:18:33.053]  We're good to go.
[00:18:49.193 --> 00:18:49.393]  I think so.
[00:19:09.563 --> 00:19:12.204]  It's to drive the Chinese in on Eastern Siberia.
[00:19:12.244 --> 00:19:18.005]  And you've got to get the left in America behind war and conflicts again, just like under Clinton.
[00:19:18.705 --> 00:19:20.666]  They were happy to blow the daylights out of Serbia.
[00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:24.447]  The irony is that today you have the peace movement.
[00:19:24.467 --> 00:19:25.867]  They say, we're against the war in Iraq.
[00:19:25.907 --> 00:19:27.028]  How about Afghanistan?
[00:19:27.308 --> 00:19:28.168]  A lot of them are for it.
[00:19:28.448 --> 00:19:29.429]  How about Sudan?
[00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.392]  They say we're in favor of attacking Sudan.
[00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:35.576]  The goal of that, of course, is to cut off 7% of the Chinese oil.
[00:19:35.856 --> 00:19:38.359]  They're in favor of attacking Burma, a Chinese ally.
[00:19:38.619 --> 00:19:42.083]  They think it's fine to go after Pakistan because they don't like Musharraf.
[00:19:46.147 --> 00:19:52.871]  And global taxation paid directly to the private banks, making them truly governmental for the first time, with their own armies, intelligence agencies, and mercenaries.
[00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:56.833]  They say, oh, Bush is against the global warming tax, so the left all gets behind it.
[00:19:57.133 --> 00:20:04.717]  And now, oh, Bush is against attacking North Africa, which he's been gearing up and wanting to do, but because he publicly says he's against it, now the left supports it.
[00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:08.099]  I mean, this is, please don't throw me in the briar patch, base psychology.
[00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:12.463]  Yeah, the problem here is you can get the left liberals for all of these policies.
[00:20:12.503 --> 00:20:17.108]  So, the one side of it is Obama is the face of imperialism.
[00:20:17.469 --> 00:20:22.394]  Obama represents a facelift for U.S.-British imperialism in places like Africa.
[00:20:22.794 --> 00:20:29.041]  The second thing is, in terms of potential for strike-breaking, austerity, cutting the living standard,
[00:20:29.802 --> 00:20:32.803]  And this kind of thing on the internal front, he has left cover.
[00:20:32.863 --> 00:20:34.943]  He can say, I'm going to break your strike.
[00:20:35.423 --> 00:20:40.644]  And he's been saying that we have to lower our standards and, quote, sacrifice for the New World Order.
[00:20:40.704 --> 00:20:43.325]  I mean, I totally agree with you on all of this.
[00:20:43.405 --> 00:20:54.207]  That particular quotation, the stuff about you can't have SUVs, you can't eat as much as you want, you can't have the temperature set where you want, that comes directly out of Brzezinski's book, Second Chance.
[00:20:54.227 --> 00:20:57.468]  That's a translation into slogans of about two pages.
[00:20:57.928 --> 00:21:00.110]  In there where Brzezinski argues against the U.S.
[00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.452]  way of life, it's not attractive to other countries.
[00:21:02.532 --> 00:21:04.834]  But now, here's the biggest consideration of all.
[00:21:05.194 --> 00:21:05.755]  Fascism.
[00:21:06.155 --> 00:21:07.396]  Postmodern fascism.
[00:21:07.496 --> 00:21:07.957]  What is it?
[00:21:08.457 --> 00:21:18.786]  Is it simply a top-down phenomenon where you have a Bush-Cheney police state where it gets more and more oppressive and more and more wiretaps and more and more snooping and opening the mail?
[00:21:19.086 --> 00:21:21.148]  Or, is it fascism something else?
[00:21:21.528 --> 00:21:30.977]  Isn't fascism a grassroots mass movement with left cover, radical cover, a movement of fanatics devoted to a personality cult?
[00:21:31.297 --> 00:21:34.840]  If you look at it from that point of view, Obama has it, nobody else has it.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.161]  We're not going to take this break.
[00:21:36.201 --> 00:21:38.463]  For InfoWars stream listeners, go to those streams.
[00:21:38.884 --> 00:21:40.405]  Everybody else will be back in three minutes.
[00:21:40.605 --> 00:21:43.588]  InfoWars.com, that's where you hear the behind the scenes right now.
[00:21:46.903 --> 00:21:48.824]  Okay, Webster, continue.
[00:21:49.185 --> 00:21:51.186]  And certainly it's cynical.
[00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:55.389]  They put a guy who's half black up there.
[00:21:55.649 --> 00:21:56.510]  Oh, everything's fine.
[00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.490]  There's this pride.
[00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.651]  Things have changed.
[00:21:59.272 --> 00:22:01.713]  And then now it fools a large sector of the left.
[00:22:02.073 --> 00:22:04.075]  They keep the wiretaps, the police state.
[00:22:04.895 --> 00:22:08.538]  But it's like the Bush administration was saying, torture children all overtly.
[00:22:08.598 --> 00:22:09.719]  Now it's smoothed over
[00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:13.060]  It's now institutionalized, refined.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.620]  They bring in the fake green revolution to regulate control tax.
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:17.721]  In the U.S.
[00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:21.401]  and England, they're announcing children cops called climate cops.
[00:22:21.421 --> 00:22:23.042]  It says, report on your parents.
[00:22:23.382 --> 00:22:26.562]  Obama wants a million to start with.
[00:22:26.883 --> 00:22:31.083]  High schoolers with guns, quote, spying on people bigger than the armed forces.
[00:22:31.744 --> 00:22:32.624]  Keep talking about that.
[00:22:33.024 --> 00:22:34.724]  Yeah, that's the essence of fascism.
[00:22:34.764 --> 00:22:37.945]  In other words, when you look at things like Al Gore's Green Army
[00:22:38.565 --> 00:22:45.130]  Obama's Green Corps, Obama's Homeland Security Corps, Obama's volunteer programs,
[00:22:46.036 --> 00:22:48.777]  All of this gives you the idea of a private army.
[00:22:48.837 --> 00:22:57.300]  In other words, an extra-legal force of goons, thugs, criminals, but also fervently idealistic.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.381]  A la Hitler, a la Stalin, a la Mao Zedong and his youth brigades.
[00:23:02.661 --> 00:23:05.242]  I would urge people to look at the young Mussolini.
[00:23:05.322 --> 00:23:09.583]  I think that's a good, clear-cut example.
[00:23:09.803 --> 00:23:12.924]  Well, Al Duce was the groundbreaker, the trailblazer.
[00:23:13.204 --> 00:23:14.825]  He invented what we're seeing today.
[00:23:15.307 --> 00:23:15.767]  Pretty much.
[00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:20.270]  Between 1919 and 1922, the idea of having a movement.
[00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.891]  Now remember... And the march on Rome.
[00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:31.577]  And Mussolini, of course... And so they come in with Obama, and then capture the popular rage in a false revolution against tyranny, truly bringing in official tyranny.
[00:23:32.145 --> 00:23:45.099]  Yes, basically, you go to fascism as a ruling elite, you go to fascism when police repression doesn't work anymore, when the army is unreliable, you've got to organize the population to crush itself.
[00:23:45.639 --> 00:23:52.186]  And for that you need a plausible demagogue, you need somebody with this messianic, utopian rhetoric.
[00:23:52.246 --> 00:23:53.027]  Pied Piper!
[00:23:53.808 --> 00:23:54.128]  Pardon me?
[00:23:54.248 --> 00:23:54.849]  Pied Piper.
[00:23:55.472 --> 00:23:55.892]  I think so.
[00:24:15.234 --> 00:24:24.600]  And these socialists and leftists who have been outraged by Bush are now driven into the arms of this corporate-crafted monster.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:25.340]  Right.
[00:24:25.621 --> 00:24:28.222]  And again, Obama has this, nobody else has it.
[00:24:28.282 --> 00:24:30.584]  Bush does not have a fascist mass movement.
[00:24:30.604 --> 00:24:37.448]  You can imagine Bush making a balcony speech a la Mussolini, or Bush making a Nuremberg rally
[00:24:37.868 --> 00:24:38.769]  Speech in the stadium.
[00:24:38.969 --> 00:24:39.630]  He can't do it.
[00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.991]  McCain can't do it.
[00:24:41.371 --> 00:24:47.276]  Mrs. Clinton has a strong following among normal Democrats, but it's not a fanatical mass movement.
[00:24:47.336 --> 00:24:53.380]  People collapsing, worshipping... Yeah, and this is why Obama is the greatest evil.
[00:24:53.521 --> 00:24:55.002]  In other words, the... Okay, here we go.
[00:24:55.022 --> 00:24:56.283]  Let's recap that right now.
[00:24:56.323 --> 00:24:57.163]  Back on the main show.
[00:24:57.484 --> 00:24:57.724]  Okay.
[00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:04.012]  Everybody knows.
[00:25:04.792 --> 00:25:08.434]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[00:25:08.454 --> 00:25:13.197]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[00:25:13.997 --> 00:25:17.899]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.382]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[00:25:23.262 --> 00:25:26.484]  If Barack Obama was a JFK or a Bobby,
[00:25:42.581 --> 00:25:45.443]  They would have whacked him, or will whack him.
[00:25:45.823 --> 00:25:53.566]  As you look at his advisors, his policies, his plans, million man armed youth brigades, environmental brigades, tie them with Al Gore endorsing him.
[00:25:54.086 --> 00:25:55.807]  Flesh that out, expand that.
[00:25:56.787 --> 00:26:04.631]  Tattletale squads, youth brigades, the war on terror will continue, but overlaid with a new quote environmentalism, people slashing SUV tires.
[00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:09.413]  It's all intensifying right now towards the movement of Barack Obama.
[00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.653]  The essence of a top-down dictatorship is what you've seen, right?
[00:26:13.673 --> 00:26:15.374]  The FBI comes and harasses you.
[00:26:15.474 --> 00:26:16.375]  They tap your phone.
[00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:17.816]  Fascism is different.
[00:26:17.836 --> 00:26:28.023]  Fascism is a gang of goons who are probably environmentalists at this point, decide that you're a polluter, and they come and burn you out and beat you up or kill you.
[00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:29.064]  And this is the difference.
[00:26:29.084 --> 00:26:31.105]  See, there's a lot of stuff on the Internet.
[00:26:31.145 --> 00:26:33.087]  There's this book by Jonah Goldberg.
[00:26:33.127 --> 00:26:36.669]  There are these things by Naomi Wolf, I think her name is.
[00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.691]  There's a guy called Britt who does
[00:26:39.527 --> 00:26:41.709]  The ten ways you can tell if you're in fascism.
[00:26:42.069 --> 00:26:44.491]  What they all leave out is the mass movement.
[00:26:44.871 --> 00:26:54.598]  The grassroots, bottom-up, left-cover, radical-cover, anti-establishment, anti-authoritarian movement, which is the essence of fascism.
[00:26:54.638 --> 00:26:57.340]  Otherwise, you don't need a new term for fascism.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.421]  Why do you have to coin this in the 1920s?
[00:26:59.602 --> 00:27:02.844]  Dictatorships, of course, have been around for a long time.
[00:27:03.243 --> 00:27:13.265]  The young Mussolini between 1919 and 1922 put together a movement of radical revolutionary socialists who were interventionists in World War I. They wanted war.
[00:27:13.345 --> 00:27:17.466]  That's one possible difference, although it's not as big a difference as you might think.
[00:27:18.266 --> 00:27:29.289]  Artists, intellectuals, people who were disgruntled war veterans, people who were coming out of the labor movement, extremely militant trade union activists.
[00:27:29.557 --> 00:27:39.600]  And you put that all together under breakdown crisis conditions of depression, and of course that's what we've got now, this then becomes a messianic, fascist-style movement.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.361]  Because you need a demagogue.
[00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:45.742]  Now, the way in which they've done it today is according to a cookbook.
[00:27:45.802 --> 00:27:50.584]  The cookbook is the Brzezinski-Soros National Endowment for Democracy.
[00:27:50.884 --> 00:27:57.906]  It's what they did in Georgia in the Roses Revolution in Tbilisi, or in Kiev in the Ukraine with the Orange Revolution.
[00:27:58.388 --> 00:28:26.607]  At the end of 2004, you get a telegenic demagogue, you get lots of money, lots of narcotics, you get renter mobs and duper mobs of fervently idealistic, swarming adolescent students and other people who just don't know what they're doing, you get a media swoon, you get media whores all over the place, bought and paid for, you get fake polling, and then you get slogans, colors, a process of branding.
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:39.387]  This stuff typically comes out of the National Endowment for Democracy, the Albert Einstein Institute, and a guy called Gene Sharp in Cambridge, Massachusetts, along with an army colonel who works with him.
[00:28:39.707 --> 00:28:43.409]  So they've perfected this for use in the former Soviet space.
[00:28:43.469 --> 00:28:49.732]  Now, what happened at the beginning of this year was the model of the People Power Coup, or CIA Color Revolution,
[00:28:50.171 --> 00:28:59.318]  Was brought home into the United States, and that is what allowed Obama to get this insurmountable lead by gaming the crazy rules of the Democratic Party.
[00:28:59.358 --> 00:29:02.100]  But again, focus on the mass movement.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.823]  Fascism is worse than a reactionary government.
[00:29:06.083 --> 00:29:10.406]  People who lived through 1922 in Italy, the seizure of power by Mussolini, or the 1933 seizure of power by Hitler,
[00:29:13.736 --> 00:29:22.840]  There is just no comparison between some bourgeois government, no matter how corrupt, how repressive, how bellicose.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.401]  Because it runs out of gas very soon and then collapses back.
[00:29:27.022 --> 00:29:28.262]  And then you get fascism.
[00:29:28.282 --> 00:29:32.884]  But a fascist system is like a wildfire with 50 mile an hour winds.
[00:29:33.204 --> 00:29:36.926]  When things is a tinderbox, it just feeds itself and exponentially grows.
[00:29:37.746 --> 00:29:45.312]  Yes, and of course, ultimately, after the fascists seize power, they then proceed to destroy all the resistance institutions in the society.
[00:29:45.372 --> 00:29:56.661]  They go around, and again, smash you if they decide you're a polluter, or if you're a, you know, you're not appreciating Barkey Obama enough, they come after you, they beat you up, they harass you.
[00:29:57.362 --> 00:29:59.043]  It's going on on the internet right now.
[00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:01.145]  I mean, you have these Obama trolls.
[00:30:01.605 --> 00:30:07.090]  Some of them are apparently in Gaza, some of them are in Bangalore, India, or other places.
[00:30:07.818 --> 00:30:14.080]  He's got a Storm Troopers on the internet who go around trying to wipe out resistance.
[00:30:14.548 --> 00:30:15.188]  On the internet.
[00:30:15.228 --> 00:30:18.010]  Now, there'll come a time when that goes into the streets.
[00:30:18.611 --> 00:30:34.020]  And these... Well, they've also announced in Canada, England, Australia, France, that they're now going directly to shutting off the old web and just not... These are the ISPs, major ones, not letting you get on the web anymore and only letting you go to sites they want.
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:34.760]  A few thousand.
[00:30:35.141 --> 00:30:36.561]  I mean, it's all happening now.
[00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:37.682]  Everything is coming down.
[00:30:37.702 --> 00:30:38.402]  And I agree with you.
[00:30:38.723 --> 00:30:43.706]  Barack Obama's bought and paid for by the same people and he does have that mass appeal, which is very dangerous.
[00:30:45.287 --> 00:30:50.390]  But again, I just want to be clear, you have the Zbigniew Brzezinski people also running the McCain camp.
[00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.071]  But let's look at the differences.
[00:30:52.111 --> 00:31:05.720]  I'm just saying, I'm not voting for either one, we need to expose both of them, because if you go to the left and say Barack Obama's bad, and lay all this stuff out that you're saying that's true tarpley, I'm talking about psychology here, then they're going to go, oh my God, you're for John McCain.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:11.124]  You're going to first go to them and say, John McCain's the new world order, John McCain represents the neocons, and Israel...
[00:31:11.984 --> 00:31:17.533]  And hold on, and hold on, and then you've got the Rockefeller power axis through Brzezinski with this demagogue.
[00:31:18.444 --> 00:31:35.558]  Barack Obama, and then as long as you explain that both of them are bad, then they go, oh I see, but if you aggress and attack their demagogue just on the face and say McCain's better, you have just actually energized, through the left-right paradigm mechanism, what's been ingrained in people, Barack Obama.
[00:31:35.598 --> 00:31:36.519]  I want you to address that.
[00:31:36.959 --> 00:31:37.660]  Well let's look at it.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:44.806]  First of all, if you get Obama, you're going to get Obama as a 1000% puppet of trilateral Bilderberg, Rockefeller, Soros.
[00:31:46.602 --> 00:31:48.623]  A fanatical Democratic Congress.
[00:31:48.983 --> 00:31:51.043]  This will give you the fascist corporate state.
[00:31:51.663 --> 00:31:52.884]  In very, very short order.
[00:31:53.204 --> 00:31:56.285]  It'll be like Carter, but a thousand percent worse.
[00:31:56.785 --> 00:31:57.965]  Now suppose you get McCain.
[00:31:58.025 --> 00:31:59.386]  Here's my analysis on McCain.
[00:31:59.826 --> 00:32:03.467]  You will get a tired, old, lame duck.
[00:32:04.027 --> 00:32:06.908]  The transition will begin on January 20th.
[00:32:07.348 --> 00:32:11.369]  He'll be a transitional figure in some ways, like Ratzinger in the Vatican.
[00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:14.110]  Somebody who's so old that he won't be there.
[00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:15.170]  He'll be a one-termer.
[00:32:15.737 --> 00:32:18.160]  And he'll be a lame duck as soon as he gets into office.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:23.965]  And he will face a ferociously hostile Democratic Congress, and that will give you gridlock.
[00:32:24.246 --> 00:32:27.009]  Now that, I think, is under that scenario.
[00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:27.509]  No, I agree.
[00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:31.533]  Gridlock, separation of power, being accentuated is good.
[00:32:31.633 --> 00:32:32.334]  But wait a minute.
[00:32:32.434 --> 00:32:33.515]  I think there's something better.
[00:32:33.675 --> 00:32:36.338]  I'm part of the Puma movement here, right?
[00:32:36.358 --> 00:32:37.519]  We have the Puma movement.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.540]  You can go to Puma08.
[00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:41.964]  We're holding a convention here in Washington on August 8th.
[00:32:42.124 --> 00:32:43.486]  Hillary will save us, Starblight?
[00:32:43.986 --> 00:32:46.729]  No, it's basically stop Obama.
[00:32:46.889 --> 00:32:48.230]  And how do you stop Obama?
[00:32:48.291 --> 00:32:52.175]  Well, you know, it would be nice to be able to stop Obama in some ideal way.
[00:32:52.455 --> 00:32:54.297]  But in the real world that we have now,
[00:32:54.813 --> 00:33:02.438]  You've got to say, the only way to do it is 175 delegates shift out of the Obama column and into the Hillary Clinton column.
[00:33:02.458 --> 00:33:06.541]  But Hillary politically doesn't have the will to do that and would be destroyed by the media if she tries.
[00:33:06.561 --> 00:33:07.301]  Could be.
[00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:08.442]  I mean, we'll soon find out.
[00:33:08.462 --> 00:33:10.884]  That's perfectly plausible, but I think this is worth a try.
[00:33:12.044 --> 00:33:35.329]  And then you've got a lame duck Hillary and a lame duck, I mean obviously, 9% approval rating for the Congress, the elite knows the system's discredited, both parties are discredited, they've got to give you a new brown face to confuse everybody, oh look it's changed, he's a black guy, and I certainly see what they're doing, and they've even said, pundits have said, this will bring people back into government, back to the table, back believing in the system,
[00:33:35.649 --> 00:33:41.272]  Then there'll be another revolution in the next four years against his socialism as it'll be built.
[00:33:41.432 --> 00:33:45.274]  Then you'll get a new right-wing government, which I think is the real final plan.
[00:33:45.294 --> 00:33:57.521]  I think ultimately, and this is that you're right, because that's what Samuel Huntington has been writing over the years, eventually what you'll get after that is a right-wing fascism that will look much more like what people think of as the Hitler regime.
[00:33:57.781 --> 00:34:00.983]  But in the meantime, look, the thing with Mrs. Clinton is simply this.
[00:34:01.707 --> 00:34:04.289]  She has now been royally betrayed.
[00:34:04.369 --> 00:34:07.650]  She has been stabbed in the back by the entire Wall Street group.
[00:34:08.051 --> 00:34:09.631]  The media have turned against her.
[00:34:09.932 --> 00:34:12.573]  She's nursing tremendous grudges.
[00:34:13.234 --> 00:34:16.936]  She would actually be more independent than any of the three.
[00:34:17.276 --> 00:34:20.237]  McCain is somebody who can be controlled through rage states.
[00:34:20.678 --> 00:34:22.519]  This is how they controlled Harry Truman.
[00:34:22.859 --> 00:34:24.860]  Obama, we've seen it, he's a complete puppet.
[00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:33.237]  Mrs. Clinton was already less of a puppet to begin with because of a sense of personal identity drawn from the years in the White House and the things that she's done.
[00:34:33.797 --> 00:34:37.661]  She is part of the establishment, of course, which that means she's established.
[00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:44.387]  She's not some nobody from nowhere, some barky who or Jimmy who that the Trilateral Commission has brought forward.
[00:34:44.607 --> 00:34:50.352]  You could argue that when Clinton got to Washington in 1992, he was a puppet of Pamela Churchill Harriman.
[00:34:50.723 --> 00:34:52.525]  And her group, the Democrats for the 1980s.
[00:34:53.046 --> 00:34:54.007]  But she's long dead.
[00:34:54.247 --> 00:34:58.953]  So these people have taken on something of a life of their own by winning elections and so forth.
[00:34:59.734 --> 00:35:06.262]  The thing with Mrs. Clinton is... I mean, come on, the Clintons were CIA being handled going back to the London office by Cord Meyer in the 60s.
[00:35:07.219 --> 00:35:10.602]  Sure, but again, that's neither here nor there right now.
[00:35:10.662 --> 00:35:14.885]  These are people who have made their own way, and you know, Cord Meyer is also long gone.
[00:35:14.905 --> 00:35:24.453]  So, those control mechanisms... No, I'm just saying, where they came from is directly out of the military industrial complex, dropping as a false left, little black hole to suck everybody into.
[00:35:24.493 --> 00:35:25.314]  Tarbly, here's the deal.
[00:35:26.004 --> 00:35:28.085]  Look, everything you're saying I believe.
[00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:29.186]  I've already checked myself.
[00:35:29.866 --> 00:35:30.487]  I respect you.
[00:35:30.507 --> 00:35:31.808]  You know, I brought you on my radio show.
[00:35:31.848 --> 00:35:34.089]  Tried to build you up.
[00:35:34.249 --> 00:35:35.570]  Took you and put you on C-SPAN.
[00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:36.330]  All of that.
[00:35:36.991 --> 00:35:39.913]  And so, I'm not attacking you here, but I have to bring this up to you.
[00:35:40.293 --> 00:35:41.153]  And I can play the clips.
[00:35:41.374 --> 00:35:42.774]  I don't really want to dig them up and play them.
[00:35:42.815 --> 00:35:44.055]  It's too painful for me to watch.
[00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:45.996]  But I haven't really talked to you in about a year.
[00:35:47.057 --> 00:35:56.918]  After those speeches you gave in Canada, what was one in Calgary, and some other ones saying Ron Paul is a fascist, run by fascists, they're planning on... No, no, no, I got the clips!
[00:35:57.038 --> 00:35:58.160]  I don't think fascist, no.
[00:36:00.095 --> 00:36:02.177]  Actually, I didn't take the time to dig those out.
[00:36:02.557 --> 00:36:11.662]  Are you saying, Webster, that you didn't give a speech in Canada where you said racists, fascists are behind Ron Paul and the elite?
[00:36:11.742 --> 00:36:12.302]  I don't think so.
[00:36:12.342 --> 00:36:13.583]  Here's my critique of Ron Paul.
[00:36:13.703 --> 00:36:14.443]  You don't think so?
[00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:17.124]  This is ancient history now, but here's the thing.
[00:36:17.184 --> 00:36:22.547]  Ron Paul was useful in the sense of having a Republican saying that he was against the Iraq War.
[00:36:22.567 --> 00:36:26.729]  In other words, having a wrecking ball inside the Republican debates was a good thing.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.384]  Now we have a world economic breakdown crisis.
[00:36:30.704 --> 00:36:40.440]  The kind of economics that Ron Paul represents is straight Milton Friedman, Chicago school, I would call it, well, Herbert Hoover economics.
[00:36:41.596 --> 00:36:47.723]  No, what it is, is classical economics we've had, and it's the Austrian School of Economics.
[00:36:47.803 --> 00:36:48.824]  Yeah, the Austrian School.
[00:36:48.864 --> 00:36:50.326]  So it's a foreign entity.
[00:36:50.966 --> 00:36:56.213]  This guy, von Hayek, who founded the school, was a paid apologist for a rent-couch... Tarbly!
[00:36:56.333 --> 00:36:56.673]  Tarbly!
[00:36:56.713 --> 00:36:57.074]  Stop!
[00:36:57.154 --> 00:36:57.454]  Stop!
[00:36:57.494 --> 00:36:57.794]  Stop!
[00:36:58.075 --> 00:36:59.596]  Look, I want to skip over this in a minute.
[00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:02.398]  But you said, no, no, no, I don't think I said that.
[00:37:02.438 --> 00:37:03.339]  You're not stupid.
[00:37:03.699 --> 00:37:04.919]  You speak three or four languages.
[00:37:04.959 --> 00:37:05.820]  You're a smart guy.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.642]  You know what you said in Canada and on your own radio show on this network.
[00:37:09.922 --> 00:37:10.822]  So I'm going to ask you again.
[00:37:10.842 --> 00:37:14.664]  Do you remember saying racist and fascist and are behind Ron Paul?
[00:37:14.684 --> 00:37:15.805]  No, I doubt it.
[00:37:15.865 --> 00:37:18.706]  But again, I'd be happy to stand corrected if I did it.
[00:37:18.806 --> 00:37:19.066]  Anyway.
[00:37:19.267 --> 00:37:20.547]  No, you know what we're going to do, Tarpley?
[00:37:20.727 --> 00:37:22.848]  We're going to take these comments, listeners will.
[00:37:22.868 --> 00:37:24.149]  They're going to take those videos.
[00:37:24.169 --> 00:37:24.949]  They're going to put it together.
[00:37:24.989 --> 00:37:27.971]  I mean, right now, I'm asking you why you said that instead of ducking it.
[00:37:28.881 --> 00:37:33.364]  Because I think that if Ron Paul ever got into power, this would be a disaster.
[00:37:33.624 --> 00:37:36.526]  I think on the other hand, Ron Paul as a protest vote is a fine thing.
[00:37:36.546 --> 00:37:46.792]  Wait a minute, you said it was anti-Mexican, racist, and that that's what was supporting him, and a bunch of other... He went very far into mexophobia, certainly, and I think that's...
[00:37:47.432 --> 00:37:48.433]  What are you talking about?
[00:37:48.493 --> 00:37:53.095]  Brzezinski and all them want 30 million illegals here blowing out the social welfare net.
[00:37:53.275 --> 00:37:54.996]  We're not against the Mexicans.
[00:37:55.156 --> 00:37:56.296]  Hold on, Tarpley.
[00:37:56.496 --> 00:37:58.857]  There's 100 million of them coming into the country.
[00:37:58.897 --> 00:38:00.158]  They've been nationalized.
[00:38:00.438 --> 00:38:01.619]  They're very nationalistic.
[00:38:01.659 --> 00:38:05.680]  We're like a country that doesn't have any of its white blood cells, like we have AIDS or something.
[00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:11.123]  And then they come in with incredibly strong nationalistic immune systems politically.
[00:38:11.403 --> 00:38:14.084]  And it's overtaking our country and bankrupting it.
[00:38:14.305 --> 00:38:20.027]  And I'm sick of seeing 12 towns in Texas fly Mexican flags at their courthouses and saying whites aren't allowed here.
[00:38:20.328 --> 00:38:23.769]  And I'm tired of the special treatment the government gives the illegals.
[00:38:24.049 --> 00:38:27.011]  And see, to you, I guess that's because I don't like Mexicans.
[00:38:27.231 --> 00:38:28.272]  And that's not what it is.
[00:38:28.312 --> 00:38:30.553]  It's very painful to have to expose.
[00:38:30.833 --> 00:38:32.114]  You speak Spanish, pal.
[00:38:32.154 --> 00:38:32.934]  So does my wife.
[00:38:33.174 --> 00:38:34.655]  She lived in Spain for six years.
[00:38:34.895 --> 00:38:37.116]  And let me tell you, she hears what's on the Mexican radio.
[00:38:37.316 --> 00:38:38.517]  And our government's behind that.
[00:38:39.537 --> 00:38:41.080]  Look, here's the thing.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.564]  Let's compare this to Jeremiah Wright.
[00:38:43.884 --> 00:38:47.751]  Everybody thought Jeremiah Wright, Obama's preacher.
[00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:52.679]  Now, the theology of Jeremiah Wright and his entire mindset
[00:38:56.809 --> 00:39:03.653]  Yeah, they wanted to radicalize blacks to make them violent so that they couldn't do what Gandhi did.
[00:39:03.813 --> 00:39:04.354]  I agree!
[00:39:04.674 --> 00:39:06.095]  But Ron Paul, hold on!
[00:39:06.535 --> 00:39:10.278]  I want you to answer Ron Paul's stuff because, you know, repeat what you said in Canada.
[00:39:10.558 --> 00:39:12.099]  about Ron Paul here on my show.
[00:39:12.399 --> 00:39:12.959]  I don't know.
[00:39:12.979 --> 00:39:20.944]  I'd have to look at... Tarpley, you said it on your radio show on this network with everyone tearing their hair out and letting you, leaving you alone to do it over and over again.
[00:39:20.964 --> 00:39:23.405]  You know full well, just don't insult my intelligence.
[00:39:23.645 --> 00:39:26.046]  I like you, Tarpley, but don't insult my intelligence.
[00:39:26.286 --> 00:39:30.389]  I want you to answer for what you said about Dr. Paul because I know he's a good man!
[00:39:31.294 --> 00:39:33.596]  Well, as an individual, I suppose he's a good man.
[00:39:34.016 --> 00:39:38.038]  But, obviously, there was a great disappointment with 9-11 Truth, for example.
[00:39:38.099 --> 00:39:48.225]  He said that he was in favor of 9-11 Truth, and he went on television, and he repudiated 9-11 Truth, and he said it was preposterous, and he told us to stop doing it because it was an embarrassment to him.
[00:39:48.826 --> 00:39:50.547]  I agree, that was a betrayal.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.923]  Okay, so, you know, good man, but a human being just like everybody else.
[00:39:54.943 --> 00:39:56.585]  But that doesn't mean the fascists are behind him.
[00:39:56.625 --> 00:39:59.388]  It doesn't mean he wants to throw Mexicans into wells.
[00:39:59.848 --> 00:40:15.463]  Again, fascists, I don't know why this comes in, but the point is, the Ford Foundation, in addition to creating organizations in the black community, like Jeremiah Wright, in addition to creating similar organizations in every ethnic group,
[00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:26.157]  The Ford Foundation has created these crazy Mexican groups like Aztlan, the group that puts out the map that all the Southwest is going to be annexed to Mexico.
[00:40:26.577 --> 00:40:30.099]  That is a pure foundation-funded provocation.
[00:40:30.119 --> 00:40:31.320]  Yes, it's a method, yes.
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:40.526]  And instead of responding to that at that level, it would be important, first of all, to continuously denounce the fact that this is the Ford Foundation and its associated foundations.
[00:40:40.874 --> 00:40:44.775]  And secondly, try to organize those Mexicans yourself.
[00:40:44.995 --> 00:40:50.057]  In other words, try to offer them some kind of a united front where they'd be fighting for something worthwhile.
[00:40:50.377 --> 00:40:56.639]  Because what they don't get out of this Aztlan nonsense is they don't get a minimum wage, they don't get a decent...
[00:40:57.159 --> 00:40:58.300]  Well, they get to turn the U.S.
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:01.883]  into Mexico City, and the U.S.
[00:41:01.963 --> 00:41:05.346]  uses a steam valve to stop true revolution reform in Mexico.
[00:41:05.646 --> 00:41:11.131]  All I want is to understand why you were saying these things, because I agree with everything you just said right there, Webster.
[00:41:11.551 --> 00:41:16.435]  If you want to help me, send me a transcript or send me a recording of what I said, and I'll be glad to comment on it.
[00:41:16.455 --> 00:41:18.657]  You know what, I'm going to pull it up here in just a minute, but go ahead.
[00:41:19.097 --> 00:41:21.319]  But I don't have it at the top of my head.
[00:41:21.399 --> 00:41:22.320]  Anyway, the point was,
[00:41:22.833 --> 00:41:26.015]  That that kind of Herbert Hoover economics is exactly what you don't need.
[00:41:26.035 --> 00:41:39.284]  In other words, if you say today, under this condition, we have a dollar crisis, we have the death agony of a dollar, we have a banking panic going on, we have dollar hyperinflation, we have a systemic breakdown crisis of the entire system.
[00:41:39.685 --> 00:41:45.889]  If you say under these conditions, I want the market, this means death on a huge scale.
[00:41:46.229 --> 00:41:48.551]  The only possible policy under these conditions is
[00:41:49.181 --> 00:41:52.429]  To try to get control of the federal government and use it against Wall Street.
[00:41:52.469 --> 00:41:55.777]  Because if you don't do that, Wall Street will take control of the federal government.
[00:41:55.817 --> 00:41:58.364]  They're gonna lose you, they're gonna suck your eye, they're gonna give us no quarter.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:03.782]  So I would say to Ron Paul, stop attacking the government, start attacking Wall Street.
[00:42:03.882 --> 00:42:05.023]  Attack Goldman Sachs.
[00:42:05.123 --> 00:42:06.703]  They're responsible for about 40% of the oil price.
[00:42:06.723 --> 00:42:08.184]  He's always attacking them.
[00:42:08.424 --> 00:42:12.346]  What do you think he does when the Fed Chairman's in there every month?
[00:42:12.766 --> 00:42:14.947]  Yeah, I saw the ads he put on television.
[00:42:14.987 --> 00:42:16.548]  The ad was attacking the Mexicans.
[00:42:16.588 --> 00:42:23.291]  He showed the people swimming across the Rio Grande, and this was his first TV ad, and I thought that was just... That was not his first TV ad.
[00:42:24.412 --> 00:42:29.121]  And it's a major issue to energize this campaign and it's a good issue.
[00:42:30.598 --> 00:42:33.901]  Well, I don't think it's a good issue, and I think it didn't prove to be a good issue.
[00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:36.482]  People thought it would be a good issue, and I think this was wrong.
[00:42:36.542 --> 00:42:40.125]  The media that's for Barack Obama was against Ron Paul.
[00:42:40.986 --> 00:42:42.567]  And so that's more proof he was the man.
[00:42:42.587 --> 00:42:42.927]  Stay there.
[00:42:43.167 --> 00:42:45.809]  We're going to skip this break for InfoWars.com.
[00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:47.411]  There's a list on the web for everybody else.
[00:42:47.751 --> 00:42:51.274]  We're going to be right back for all our fine MNM affiliates in just three minutes.
[00:42:51.314 --> 00:42:54.276]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:42:54.476 --> 00:42:56.277]  We have author Webster Tarpley with us.
[00:42:57.939 --> 00:42:59.239]  Okay, let's keep going, Tarpley.
[00:42:59.259 --> 00:42:59.640]  Keep going.
[00:43:00.908 --> 00:43:02.449]  So, on what?
[00:43:02.489 --> 00:43:03.810]  I want to finish up on Ron Paul.
[00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:04.491]  I'll quit interrupting.
[00:43:04.511 --> 00:43:04.811]  Go ahead.
[00:43:05.231 --> 00:43:05.551]  Okay.
[00:43:06.112 --> 00:43:07.132]  You want more Ron Paul?
[00:43:07.213 --> 00:43:09.574]  Yeah, I mean, I want to hear you defend that stuff you were saying.
[00:43:09.914 --> 00:43:11.716]  Oh, by the way, let me ask you, where was it a year ago?
[00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:15.170]  Where you threw down the gauntlet on Paul, was it in Calgary?
[00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:16.271]  Because I'm trying to Google the term.
[00:43:16.291 --> 00:43:17.171]  I'm sorry, I don't know.
[00:43:17.371 --> 00:43:18.131]  You were in Canada.
[00:43:18.151 --> 00:43:19.531]  Where were you a year ago in Canada?
[00:43:19.972 --> 00:43:21.072]  I don't know.
[00:43:21.492 --> 00:43:23.152]  It was Vancouver, British Columbia.
[00:43:23.332 --> 00:43:23.912]  Vancouver!
[00:43:23.952 --> 00:43:24.532]  There we go.
[00:43:24.552 --> 00:43:25.013]  That was it.
[00:43:25.033 --> 00:43:25.913]  I'm going to find it right now.
[00:43:25.973 --> 00:43:26.633]  Go ahead, Darby.
[00:43:26.753 --> 00:43:27.453]  All right, wonderful.
[00:43:28.513 --> 00:43:32.054]  The point is, what you need now is basically a version of New Deal economics.
[00:43:32.734 --> 00:43:37.315]  And this, I think, is something that would revolve, for example, around foreclosures.
[00:43:37.795 --> 00:43:40.496]  Ron Paul went on Larry Kudlow on CNBC.
[00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:45.023]  And he said he didn't believe in bailing out people who had bought too much house.
[00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:51.787]  Well, what you've got to do under these circumstances is a uniform federal law that says simply, no foreclosures.
[00:43:52.087 --> 00:43:53.788]  Stop all foreclosures.
[00:43:54.446 --> 00:43:55.987]  And, uh, take it from there.
[00:43:56.368 --> 00:44:00.491]  So, Ron Paul, I don't think would support that, because that would be big government, from his point of view.
[00:44:00.811 --> 00:44:09.898]  You should outlaw foreclosures for five years of the duration of the crisis, of homes, farms, businesses, and everything else that's useful economically.
[00:44:10.178 --> 00:44:12.440]  You should outlaw adjustable-rate mortgages.
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.201]  You should outlaw derivatives.
[00:44:14.281 --> 00:44:20.286]  The current crisis that's going on is a crisis of one quadrillion dollars of derivatives
[00:44:21.036 --> 00:44:24.499]  And there is no way out of that unless you simply wipe them out.
[00:44:24.559 --> 00:44:25.620]  You've got to shred them.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.401]  You've got to delete them.
[00:44:27.882 --> 00:44:33.406]  You've got to get them out of the world because you cannot bail out a capital structure that is that huge.
[00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:38.110]  So I never heard Ron Paul talking about any of this stuff.
[00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.211]  Another thing you'd need to do
[00:44:39.907 --> 00:44:41.727]  is to begin to shift the tax burden.
[00:44:41.787 --> 00:44:46.988]  It is unrealistic in the extreme to talk about abolishing the federal income tax.
[00:44:47.028 --> 00:44:53.490]  The only thing you can do is to shift the tax burden off the individual taxpayer and on to Wall Street.
[00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:57.490]  How about a Tobin tax or a securities transfer tax?
[00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:03.491]  One percent on the entire turnover of Wall Street financial security.
[00:45:06.334 --> 00:45:07.656]  Money transfer tax, huh?
[00:45:07.816 --> 00:45:09.278]  Yeah, securities transfer tax.
[00:45:09.719 --> 00:45:10.661]  With every transaction.
[00:45:10.701 --> 00:45:11.983]  A sales tax for Wall Street.
[00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:14.046]  What's a sales tax in Texas, Alex?
[00:45:14.858 --> 00:45:15.558]  Seven percent.
[00:45:15.759 --> 00:45:16.399]  Seven percent.
[00:45:16.479 --> 00:45:19.601]  If you can pay seven percent, how come Wall Street can't pay one percent?
[00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:20.741]  Make that a demand.
[00:45:21.202 --> 00:45:22.742]  And that's on everything that goes through.
[00:45:22.762 --> 00:45:27.065]  Well, that would slow down a lot of the blind putting and all the rest of it.
[00:45:27.365 --> 00:45:27.825]  Absolutely.
[00:45:27.845 --> 00:45:29.386]  And you'd apply that in Chicago, too.
[00:45:29.546 --> 00:45:35.389]  And if it's a quadrillion dollars of derivatives, and maybe two-thirds of that in the U.S., say $650 trillion,
[00:45:36.966 --> 00:45:40.747]  If you take one percent of that, you get 6.5 trillion of tax revenue.
[00:45:41.087 --> 00:45:51.930]  That would go a long way towards guaranteeing the permanent future of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the entire social safety net, which I think are absolutely indispensable.
[00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.370]  Ron Paul thinks that these are things to get rid of.
[00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:55.870]  We're coming back live right now.
[00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:56.851]  We're coming back live right now.
[00:45:56.871 --> 00:45:57.171]  Here we go.
[00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:14.872]  I just want a free country.
[00:46:14.892 --> 00:46:21.355]  I just want stability to be able to raise my family.
[00:46:21.415 --> 00:46:23.256]  But now we go into waters.
[00:46:23.276 --> 00:46:23.916]  Very dangerous.
[00:46:36.795 --> 00:46:40.256]  crises we're headed into dwarf world war two and world war one combined.
[00:46:40.656 --> 00:46:42.317]  Webster Tarpey, do you agree with that statement?
[00:46:42.457 --> 00:46:44.637]  And now expanding, where do you see things going?
[00:46:45.017 --> 00:46:48.598]  How do you see the election turning out currently with the trends?
[00:46:48.658 --> 00:46:52.940]  We see Barack Obama going and kneeling before Bernanke in little secret meetings.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.040]  That's in the news today.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.601]  We hear he's going for this particular governor.
[00:46:56.641 --> 00:46:57.461]  What do you know about him?
[00:46:58.541 --> 00:47:01.242]  Well, that's Governor Kaine here in Virginia.
[00:47:01.262 --> 00:47:02.702]  He's not distinguished.
[00:47:02.762 --> 00:47:04.743]  I think the main thing, of course, is Obama.
[00:47:05.636 --> 00:47:08.337]  The point about the election is this is not yet determined.
[00:47:08.357 --> 00:47:11.238]  This is open-ended, and we better seize the time.
[00:47:11.638 --> 00:47:13.259]  The big thing is the scandal dossiers.
[00:47:13.559 --> 00:47:15.140]  Obama does not run on issues.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.320]  Obama runs on the fact that he's a messiah.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.041]  Therefore, if you try to fight him on issues, it's impotent.
[00:47:20.081 --> 00:47:20.641]  It doesn't work.
[00:47:20.661 --> 00:47:22.642]  You've got to tear down the messiah.
[00:47:22.682 --> 00:47:24.743]  That means ad hominem attacks, scandals.
[00:47:25.143 --> 00:47:25.684]  And all the rest.
[00:47:25.724 --> 00:47:27.025]  Here are the scandals that I see.
[00:47:27.545 --> 00:47:37.232]  One is the Chicago corruption, Resco, Ouchi, Al-Samari, the three Levantines, the three Syrian or Iraqi Arabs that are behind him.
[00:47:37.633 --> 00:47:45.879]  And these are all three convicted felons, all three embezzlers on a grand scale, millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases.
[00:47:45.939 --> 00:47:47.520]  That's part of his financial machine.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.063]  Secondly, the Weathermen terrorists, the bombers,
[00:47:51.533 --> 00:47:58.648]  Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dorn, and a whole creek of other unreconstructed, unrepentant weathermen who are part of his machine.
[00:47:58.668 --> 00:47:59.871]  They're his personal advisors.
[00:48:00.828 --> 00:48:05.251]  is probably the guy who gave Obama the biggest break he ever got in his career.
[00:48:05.452 --> 00:48:06.312]  That's the second level.
[00:48:06.733 --> 00:48:11.536]  Third level is this, what I call the Ford Foundation Church of the Final Counterinsurgency.
[00:48:11.576 --> 00:48:22.725]  In other words, Trinity United Church of Christ, Jeremiah Wright, Dwight Hopkins, a Ford Foundation fellow, Otis Moss III, another Ford Foundation grant recipient, James Cone.
[00:48:23.085 --> 00:48:26.828]  That is this black liberation theology, which is essentially a doctrine of
[00:48:27.347 --> 00:48:34.274]  of hatred and to perpetuate racial conflict rather than to get rid of it another level larry sinclair
[00:48:34.927 --> 00:48:35.847]  And Donald Young.
[00:48:36.007 --> 00:48:42.329]  Donald Young, the choir master of that church, found dead right before Christmas of last year.
[00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:45.049]  He was the gay choir master in Wright's Church.
[00:48:45.529 --> 00:48:55.071]  Larry Sinclair is a gay man who said that he had a homosexual encounter twice with Obama in 1999, with Obama using crack cocaine.
[00:48:55.131 --> 00:48:58.652]  I would urge people to look into Larry Sinclair, his allegations.
[00:48:59.012 --> 00:49:01.893]  It's been up on the internet since the middle of January.
[00:49:02.375 --> 00:49:03.935]  Millions and millions of hits on that.
[00:49:04.436 --> 00:49:07.757]  He gave a press conference here at the National Press Club and was then arrested.
[00:49:08.157 --> 00:49:18.880]  Arrested on a warrant signed by Beau Biden, the Attorney General of Delaware, son of Joe Biden, the Senator who's trying to become either Vice President... And it turned out it was fake, yeah.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:23.062]  It's trumped up charges, but they're continuing to persecute him.
[00:49:23.563 --> 00:49:30.467]  Larry Sinclair is in danger and he deserves the support of people who don't want to have a presidential campaign under Gestapo conditions.
[00:49:30.908 --> 00:49:36.051]  Another layer, Ilya Sakhmatov is a Chechen ambassador of the Chechen terrorist group.
[00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:38.253]  They've killed more than a thousand people.
[00:49:39.013 --> 00:49:41.395]  Ilya Sakhmatov is living here in Washington at U.S.
[00:49:41.435 --> 00:49:43.356]  government expense, taxpayer expense,
[00:49:43.755 --> 00:49:51.019]  He gets an apartment, a secretary, an office, a travel budget, a PR budget, and a nice stipend that most people could not afford.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:58.964]  And the reason he's here is because Big New Brzezinski lobbied, because Big New Brzezinski is so consumed by hatred of Russia that he wants Akhmadov here.
[00:49:59.665 --> 00:50:00.085]  And others.
[00:50:00.598 --> 00:50:12.468]  And then we have this Get Whitey tape, the famous Hate Whitey tape by Michelle Obama, which is clearly in the air and is likely to be brought out after the Democratic Convention is over.
[00:50:12.508 --> 00:50:24.158]  I would just say to the people on the Republican side, don't be like that Japanese admiral at the Battle of Midway trying to get everything perfect before you launch the attack, because you may get hit first, as the Eliot Spitzer case shows.
[00:50:24.538 --> 00:50:25.859]  So that tape is in the background.
[00:50:25.899 --> 00:50:26.620]  So we've got at least
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.100]  Six or seven layers.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.221]  All right, Webster, stay there.
[00:50:29.261 --> 00:50:30.581]  We just got 20 minutes left.
[00:50:30.601 --> 00:50:32.402]  We're gonna open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:33.683]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:53.369 --> 00:50:55.089]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:50:55.249 --> 00:50:56.450]  The late, great USA.
[00:50:56.470 --> 00:51:01.751]  That's the one that BP, British Petroleum, wants back because they had it in the past.
[00:51:01.951 --> 00:51:05.292]  Balochistan, uh, uh.
[00:51:05.472 --> 00:51:08.293]  The Cheney Faction, right now.
[00:51:08.633 --> 00:51:12.094]  Now we have fought back against this with the 9-11 crew squads.
[00:51:12.154 --> 00:51:13.474]  Here we are in Austin, Texas.
[00:51:14.074 --> 00:51:15.175]  Here's my friend Matt Day.
[00:51:15.215 --> 00:51:15.295]  Sup?
[00:51:16.175 --> 00:51:16.635]  You know what?
[00:51:16.655 --> 00:51:17.116]  I don't care.
[00:51:17.156 --> 00:51:17.656]  You know what?

[00:51:21.739 --> 00:51:22.079]  You know what?
[00:51:22.099 --> 00:51:22.459]  I don't care.
[00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:22.859]  You know what?
[00:51:22.939 --> 00:51:23.320]  I don't care.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:23.900]  You know what?
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:24.801]  I don't care.
[00:51:24.861 --> 00:51:25.381]  You know what?
[00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:25.921]  I don't care.
[00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:26.622]  You know what?
[00:51:26.642 --> 00:51:26.982]  I don't care.
[00:51:27.022 --> 00:51:27.783]  You know what?
[00:51:27.983 --> 00:51:28.403]  I don't care.
[00:51:28.423 --> 00:51:29.063]  You know what?
[00:51:29.243 --> 00:51:29.664]  I don't care.
[00:51:29.744 --> 00:51:30.204]  You know what?
[00:51:30.264 --> 00:51:30.845]  I don't care.
[00:51:30.865 --> 00:51:31.565]  You know what?
[00:51:31.665 --> 00:51:32.245]  I don't care.
[00:51:32.285 --> 00:51:32.886]  You know what?
[00:51:33.026 --> 00:51:33.866]  I don't care.
[00:51:33.906 --> 00:51:34.627]  You know what?
[00:51:34.647 --> 00:51:35.167]  I don't care.
[00:51:35.187 --> 00:51:35.808]  You know what?
[00:51:35.828 --> 00:51:36.208]  I don't care.
[00:51:36.248 --> 00:51:36.548]  You know what?
[00:51:36.568 --> 00:51:36.848]  I don't care.
[00:51:36.888 --> 00:51:37.349]  You know what?
[00:51:37.409 --> 00:51:37.989]  I don't care.
[00:51:38.009 --> 00:51:38.429]  You know what?
[00:51:38.449 --> 00:51:38.730]  I don't care.
[00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:39.070]  You know what?
[00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:39.570]  I don't care.
[00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:40.391]  You know what?
[00:51:40.411 --> 00:51:40.891]  I don't care.
[00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:41.511]  You know what?
[00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:41.972]  I don't care.
[00:51:42.052 --> 00:51:42.712]  You know what?
[00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:43.553]  I don't care.
[00:51:43.753 --> 00:51:44.313]  You know what?
[00:51:44.373 --> 00:51:44.813]  I don't care
[00:51:49.142 --> 00:51:51.043]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:51.523 --> 00:51:54.464]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:57.886 --> 00:51:59.847]  We are carrying his book.
[00:51:59.927 --> 00:52:01.608]  I think it's important.
[00:52:13.453 --> 00:52:18.121]  Information, Obama, The Postmodern Coup, available at Infowars.com.
[00:52:18.922 --> 00:52:20.304]  This book is now sold out.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:22.480]  We're one of the few places you can get it.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.101]  They're doing another reprint right now.
[00:52:24.461 --> 00:52:28.923]  But we have a couple hundred of them right now in my bookstore, right here in the room next to me.
[00:52:29.503 --> 00:52:31.484]  Online bookstore, Infowars.com.
[00:52:31.564 --> 00:52:32.444]  Get it today.
[00:52:32.884 --> 00:52:36.425]  Obama, The Post, Modern Coup, Webster, Griffin, Tarpley.
[00:52:36.465 --> 00:52:38.626]  While you're at it, get Truth Rising, my new 9-11 film.
[00:52:39.166 --> 00:52:40.667]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:52:41.047 --> 00:52:43.888]  Hey, Tarpley, have you seen my new film, Endgame, yet?
[00:52:44.568 --> 00:52:45.469]  I'm afraid I haven't.
[00:52:45.509 --> 00:52:48.031]  I've been just doing Obama, Waldo, Waldo, Obama.
[00:52:48.071 --> 00:52:49.512]  Let me tell you one thing, though, Alex.
[00:52:50.152 --> 00:52:55.536]  In Amsterdam, I was just in Amsterdam, Holland, last Tuesday, to give a talk in the series.
[00:52:55.556 --> 00:52:58.198]  They had their docs at the docks.
[00:52:58.218 --> 00:52:59.298]  They have it every couple of months.
[00:52:59.338 --> 00:53:03.181]  They'd had Cynthia McKinney, they'd had a few others, and eventually they got to me.
[00:53:03.701 --> 00:53:09.806]  The main anti-Bilderberg publisher in the Netherlands is a guy called René van Praag.
[00:53:10.206 --> 00:53:11.207]  P-R-A-A-G.
[00:53:12.134 --> 00:53:18.947]  And he gave me an idea that I wanted to share with you that you should write a book in addition to everything else you've done.
[00:53:19.488 --> 00:53:24.538]  You should somehow boil down your approach to things into a book and he would be
[00:53:25.146 --> 00:53:27.667]  Interested in looking into it with you.
[00:53:28.608 --> 00:53:29.909]  He's put out a tremendous thing.
[00:53:29.949 --> 00:53:31.870]  It's a comic book called Agent Orange.
[00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:43.316]  It's an attack on Prince Bernard, the founder of the Bilderberger Group, showing Bernard as an SA, stormtrooper, and otherwise, you know, Nazi, back in the 1920s and 30s.
[00:53:43.696 --> 00:53:47.358]  So, the guy's got some pretty good things going in his publishing house.
[00:53:47.398 --> 00:53:51.500]  So, maybe you need to get into the book dimension in addition to everything else.
[00:53:53.470 --> 00:54:03.845]  I did put Dissent and Deterrenting out, and we are working on a book right now, 1984-1776 is the name of it, and it's basically an overview of everything we do and what our philosophy is, so that's a good idea.
[00:54:04.886 --> 00:54:09.272]  Let's cover any other issues you think are important, Webster, before we take calls.
[00:54:10.462 --> 00:54:13.326]  Just one more, just so people can keep on top of it.
[00:54:13.346 --> 00:54:16.630]  The face of false flag terrorism in the future, right?
[00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:19.794]  Again, I don't think it's going to be Islamic fundamentalist anymore.
[00:54:20.154 --> 00:54:25.701]  The only place they use Islamic fundamentalism now is to invade Northwest Pakistan.
[00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:32.704]  But let me just tick off a bunch of faces, and then you can put together the composite of the next false flag.
[00:54:33.084 --> 00:54:42.327]  One of the reasons the ruling elite wants Obama is they think with Obama, you could do false flag again, because Obama could say it, and then they would believe it.
[00:54:42.407 --> 00:54:45.529]  Whereas if McCain or Hillary said it, they wouldn't believe it.
[00:54:45.569 --> 00:54:48.230]  And that was in the Atlantic Monthly from Andrew Sullivan.
[00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:51.051]  The new face, the Unabomber, right?
[00:54:51.171 --> 00:54:54.192]  Ecological terrorism, Earth First, this kind of stuff.
[00:54:54.716 --> 00:55:10.085]  Secondly, the guy that I just mentioned, Ilyas Akhmedov, as a figure for Chechen terrorism, and of course it's not just Chechen terrorism against the Russians, but it's every little group, the Basques, the Kurds, it's every group that wants
[00:55:10.546 --> 00:55:12.166]  That's the Roman management system.
[00:55:34.662 --> 00:55:35.482]  Kazmierczak.
[00:55:35.562 --> 00:55:36.002]  Remember him?
[00:55:36.062 --> 00:55:37.963]  The Northern Illinois shooter.
[00:55:38.383 --> 00:55:42.965]  The guy who was a student who had left-wing social concerns.
[00:55:42.985 --> 00:55:45.325]  He was concerned about social justice.
[00:55:45.726 --> 00:55:46.766]  And, of course, Cho.
[00:55:47.526 --> 00:55:49.147]  The shooter at Virginia Tech.
[00:55:49.347 --> 00:55:51.907]  A psychotic student, but of course, look at him.
[00:55:52.168 --> 00:55:53.288]  He looks like he's Chinese.
[00:55:53.328 --> 00:55:55.048]  He's Korean, but close enough.
[00:55:55.769 --> 00:55:57.529]  He's not a Manchurian shooter.
[00:55:57.569 --> 00:55:59.630]  He's a Korean shooter right next door.
[00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:03.031]  A Chinese who's crazy and who's shooting.
[00:56:03.692 --> 00:56:14.936]  Another one, Litvinenko, Litvinenko of the KGB, remember him, the radiological terrorism case in London, so a Russian with nuclear terrorism.
[00:56:15.456 --> 00:56:19.678]  And then finally this FARC, right, the Betancourt, they did a whole media circus around
[00:56:20.518 --> 00:56:27.523]  This guerrilla movement supported to some degree by Venezuela, or at least verbally, that operates inside Colombia.
[00:56:27.903 --> 00:56:29.644]  The goal there is typical Brzezinski.
[00:56:29.945 --> 00:56:34.808]  When a neocon looks at Venezuela, the neocon says, bomb them right away, invade them.
[00:56:34.848 --> 00:56:40.332]  Brzezinski says, you can't do that, you're too weak, you're too bankrupt, you're too isolated, don't do it.
[00:56:40.512 --> 00:56:44.775]  All right, Webster, we're going to take this break and come back with you in the final segment and take phone calls.
[00:56:45.196 --> 00:56:46.137]  Everybody stay with us.
[00:56:46.157 --> 00:56:50.740]  We're interviewing the author of Obama, The Postmodern Coup, Webster Griffin Tarbly.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.062]  Get the book at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:56:57.005 --> 00:56:59.848]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.

[00:57:56.408 --> 00:57:58.531]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[00:57:58.811 --> 00:58:02.976]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[00:58:03.137 --> 00:58:04.238]  How so, Clyde?
[00:58:04.418 --> 00:58:07.182]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[00:58:07.362 --> 00:58:12.008]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[00:58:12.208 --> 00:58:12.729]  Just watch.
[00:58:13.334 --> 00:58:15.275]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[00:58:15.415 --> 00:58:16.676]  You gotta be kidding me.
[00:58:16.916 --> 00:58:17.156]  Nope.
[00:58:17.296 --> 00:58:21.358]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[00:58:21.579 --> 00:58:23.800]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:24.340]  Why?
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.321]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[00:58:26.521 --> 00:58:27.842]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[00:58:28.062 --> 00:58:31.604]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[00:58:31.664 --> 00:58:34.626]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[00:58:34.746 --> 00:58:35.286]  No way.
[00:58:35.586 --> 00:58:38.968]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[00:58:39.128 --> 00:58:41.750]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:42.790]  I already got some.
[00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:44.671]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[00:58:44.911 --> 00:58:49.634]  Identity Stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at IDStronghold.com.
[00:58:49.874 --> 00:58:51.515]  IDStronghold.com?
[00:58:51.735 --> 00:58:52.055]  Right.
[00:58:52.215 --> 00:58:55.257]  Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[00:58:55.477 --> 00:59:02.201]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:03.762]  And we knew what to do.
[00:59:04.548 --> 00:59:05.589]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:12.234]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:59:12.855 --> 00:59:21.362]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:28.567]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:59:28.847 --> 00:59:31.909]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:59:32.009 --> 00:59:37.254]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:59:37.794 --> 00:59:40.416]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:48.763]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:50.162 --> 00:59:52.944]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:59:52.964 --> 00:59:54.745]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.052 --> 01:00:20.695]  Final segment with Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[01:00:23.517 --> 01:00:27.441]  I did find his Canada speech.
[01:00:29.471 --> 01:00:31.713]  Very interesting, to say the least.
[01:00:31.733 --> 01:00:35.216]  You just type into Google v911truth.org and watch it.
[01:00:35.256 --> 01:00:35.856]  It's very interesting.
[01:00:36.176 --> 01:00:38.778]  I'm watching some clips during the breaks, but I did identify and find that.
[01:00:39.319 --> 01:00:48.166]  But I can understand his fears and looking for the establishment, trying to find some popular movement to hijack, but that certainly wasn't Ron Paul.
[01:00:49.025 --> 01:01:02.072]  That certainly wasn't what we saw there, and that was clear to me, and I think he's been very, very healthy for the planet and for people out there to think and understand the Federal Reserve is not their friend, the inflation tax, everything that's happening.
[01:01:02.312 --> 01:01:05.274]  I want to go to Peggy Lynn, Don, Nina, and others here in a moment.
[01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:09.917]  Webster, in the 15 minutes or so we have left, or 14 minutes we have left with you, but
[01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:15.797]  In closing, what do you think is going to happen with the economy?
[01:01:16.218 --> 01:01:18.981]  What are the bankers that own the planet planning to do with that?
[01:01:19.021 --> 01:01:23.526]  We know it's a carbon tax paid directly to them and some other things, but I want Webster Tarpley's take on that.
[01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:36.903]  Well, the Obama program, as he suggested in that no SUVs, no eating as much as you want, no setting the temperature where you want, is going to be extreme austerity, but with left cover.
[01:01:37.143 --> 01:01:44.112]  For the polar bears to save the planet, global warming, this entire demagogic package of Al Gore and
[01:01:44.756 --> 01:01:45.557]  And Prince Charles.
[01:01:45.597 --> 01:01:50.461]  So he'll be demanding global austerity for global warming.
[01:01:50.561 --> 01:01:52.023]  By the way, let me just show people this.
[01:01:52.383 --> 01:01:53.924]  This is Infowars.net story.
[01:01:53.964 --> 01:01:55.926]  British kids encouraged to become climate cops.
[01:01:56.707 --> 01:02:01.711]  Ads in all the major newspapers saying, report on your parents, create a dossier on them, watch them, report on them.
[01:02:02.012 --> 01:02:06.676]  They wear red, black and white uniforms with khaki Nazi outfits.
[01:02:06.696 --> 01:02:08.457]  And there's a polar bear there behind them.
[01:02:08.738 --> 01:02:09.478]  Who's their buddy?
[01:02:10.983 --> 01:02:12.064]  Or a panda, of course.
[01:02:13.405 --> 01:02:16.706]  So anyway, it's going to be killer austerity, crushing austerity.
[01:02:17.047 --> 01:02:18.387]  My calculation is the U.S.
[01:02:18.427 --> 01:02:23.910]  living standard is already down 60% from the LBJ period approximately.
[01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:29.473]  And now they'd like to cut that in half again under the auspices now of left cover.
[01:02:29.834 --> 01:02:33.676]  If there's a strike wave, they want Obama in the White House to be able to break
[01:02:34.496 --> 01:02:38.679]  A nationwide strike wave or general strike, which might well emerge.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.741]  And on the global scale, it's the same thing.
[01:02:41.081 --> 01:02:47.206]  Now, none of this will make any difference, because remember, what's coming down is one thousand trillion of derivatives.
[01:02:47.406 --> 01:02:50.849]  One quadrillion of derivatives have gone into reverse leverage.
[01:02:50.909 --> 01:02:59.095]  And the total crisis, according to other economists we talked to, is six thousand trillion.
[01:03:01.798 --> 01:03:04.620]  Well, that's an interesting figure.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:10.365]  I'm just going by derivatives, and I think the best estimate I could get is about 1 quadrillion.
[01:03:11.146 --> 01:03:17.731]  So it's 1,000 trillion, but I would perfectly, I was assuming to me that it would probably be up to 1.2, 1.5, if it were up to 6.
[01:03:18.091 --> 01:03:18.452]  Who says 6, Alex?
[01:03:22.363 --> 01:03:34.127]  Well, I've had a lot of different guests on saying the total amount of debt packages, credit cards, mortgages, all the different types of derivatives and leveraging out there, they say it's around $6,000 trillion.
[01:03:34.387 --> 01:03:35.928]  So we're talking $6 quadrillion.
[01:03:35.968 --> 01:03:37.548]  Well, that of course makes it even worse.
[01:03:37.888 --> 01:03:40.249]  You can see, the value of the... Well, no, you're right.
[01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.829]  I mean, you're right.
[01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:44.531]  They say with just derivatives alone, certain types, we're at $1,000.
[01:03:46.071 --> 01:03:55.580]  Well, this obviously is a black hole that can consume the Earth, because the total value of the planet Earth and everything in it, at current rates, is about 100 trillion at the very most.
[01:03:56.061 --> 01:03:59.784]  So 6,000 trillion, you can see you're just out of the ballpark.
[01:04:00.185 --> 01:04:04.969]  There is no way to use austerity to prop up these bankrupt structures.
[01:04:05.129 --> 01:04:07.391]  No, they're just preparing us to be slaves.
[01:04:07.872 --> 01:04:08.693]  But they're going to try.
[01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:10.033]  And it will fail.
[01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:14.334]  So you'll have basically the decline of civilization unless somebody stops it.
[01:04:14.374 --> 01:04:19.636]  Now, in the middle of all that, though, I would say, remember, defeat the number one option of Wall Street.
[01:04:19.736 --> 01:04:20.716]  It's clearly Obama.
[01:04:21.156 --> 01:04:23.117]  Obama is the facelift for imperialism.
[01:04:23.137 --> 01:04:25.237]  He's the credibility for false flag.
[01:04:25.258 --> 01:04:29.259]  He's the ability to carry out austerity and strike-breaking on the home front.
[01:04:29.579 --> 01:04:35.000]  If you defeat Obama, you will have defeated the entire banking establishment and the controlled corporate media.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.661]  That would then lead to an open field
[01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:38.608]  Period.
[01:04:38.728 --> 01:05:01.195]  Again, if it were McCain, it would be a period of intense fighting and gridlock between the Congress and the President, which would be ideal for radicalizing things, in my view, in a New Deal direction, so that you'd get powerful measures for economic recovery that cannot be this free market stuff, but have to be powerful state interventions to get things going again.
[01:05:01.215 --> 01:05:02.095]  In other words, what worked
[01:05:02.615 --> 01:05:06.620]  In the 1930s and what would work again is distinct from, well, Bush.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.623]  Bush is a reincarnation of Herbert Hoover.
[01:05:08.663 --> 01:05:10.084]  I disagree with you on the Webster.
[01:05:10.144 --> 01:05:15.471]  I agree with everything you've said about the world, you know, geopolitical landscape, what's happening, who's behind what.
[01:05:15.991 --> 01:05:21.258]  And just like Ron Paul disagrees with you, I disagree with your solution of more government.
[01:05:21.778 --> 01:05:29.061]  Now I understand the magical plan of angels in government that would direct the largess towards the people and redistribute it.
[01:05:29.301 --> 01:05:30.062]  It isn't going to work.
[01:05:31.002 --> 01:05:33.663]  The New World Order crowd controlled the left and the right.
[01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:37.125]  They controlled the attempted fascist coup with Bush's grandfather behind it.
[01:05:37.825 --> 01:05:39.546]  And they controlled FDR.
[01:05:40.047 --> 01:05:42.349]  And so that's where we really differ, Webster.
[01:05:42.409 --> 01:05:44.571]  I think it's a mistake to say they controlled FDR.
[01:05:44.591 --> 01:05:49.655]  They tried to kill him even before he got into office with that attempted assassination in Miami.
[01:05:49.995 --> 01:05:53.638]  And then they tried to organize the Morgan coup to overthrow him.
[01:05:53.718 --> 01:05:56.040]  As the McCormick-Dixton Committee showed.
[01:05:56.901 --> 01:06:00.263]  Let's go ahead and talk to Peggy in Pennsylvania.
[01:06:00.303 --> 01:06:01.224]  Peggy, you're on the air.
[01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:04.267]  Alex, sometimes
[01:06:05.223 --> 01:06:10.104]  Lately I'm beginning to think that this show is just another disinformation show and I'll tell you why.
[01:06:10.124 --> 01:06:12.325]  It's much ado about nothing.
[01:06:13.065 --> 01:06:17.206]  Ron Paul came along and he seemed to be the perfect candidate for the typical American.
[01:06:17.986 --> 01:06:20.847]  Intelligent as well as just a normal type of guy.
[01:06:21.387 --> 01:06:25.628]  But all of a sudden he steps down with no... and it was a surprise to all of us.
[01:06:26.325 --> 01:06:26.625]  Mr. Tarr,
[01:06:57.426 --> 01:07:01.189]  Alex, he lost because of the corruption in the government.
[01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:05.233]  I'm not going to mention any particular... So how are we bad right now?
[01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:06.134]  I want to hear it from you.
[01:07:06.834 --> 01:07:07.715]  Alright, I'll tell you.
[01:07:08.216 --> 01:07:12.239]  I saw the takeover of Ohio from my own perspective and I know who did it.
[01:07:12.359 --> 01:07:14.521]  I won't mention any names or anything like that.
[01:07:15.402 --> 01:07:19.766]  But there is a force behind this that is not being mentioned.
[01:07:20.487 --> 01:07:26.818]  And Mr. Tarpley, for instance, claims that he wants Hillary as a substitute because she's easier... Wait a minute, ma'am.
[01:07:27.018 --> 01:07:28.240]  Let me ask you a question, Peggy.
[01:07:28.761 --> 01:07:29.783]  Did we screen your phone call?
[01:07:30.624 --> 01:07:30.965]  Uh, yeah.
[01:07:31.586 --> 01:07:33.209]  He knew it was me, if that's what you're asking.
[01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:34.311]  Pardon me?
[01:07:34.997 --> 01:07:37.919]  The guy that answered me knows my voice and he knew it was me.
[01:07:38.319 --> 01:07:39.660]  Let's bring John in here right now.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.240]  Ma'am, we don't screen phone calls.
[01:07:41.501 --> 01:07:42.781]  Alex, please don't do this.
[01:07:42.841 --> 01:07:43.882]  Are you a schizophrenic?
[01:07:44.442 --> 01:07:48.524]  Let me guess, I bet you think the world revolves around you and we all know who you are.
[01:07:48.544 --> 01:07:49.665]  Ma'am, I don't know you from Adam.
[01:07:49.925 --> 01:07:51.006]  Alex, shame on you.
[01:07:51.206 --> 01:07:52.066]  Shame on your lies.
[01:07:52.146 --> 01:07:53.287]  Are you a schizophrenic?
[01:07:53.527 --> 01:07:57.330]  I never thought that you would... You are a schizophrenic, aren't you, you nutcase?
[01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.931]  How dare you, Alex?
[01:07:58.031 --> 01:07:58.811]  All right, let her go.
[01:07:59.152 --> 01:08:00.313]  Bring John Harmon in here.
[01:08:00.613 --> 01:08:02.735]  You know, I'm tired of these schizophrenics on the internet.
[01:08:02.835 --> 01:08:07.198]  I am really sick of them and their craziness and the fact that people will believe them.
[01:08:07.779 --> 01:08:08.679]  They call in here.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:14.544]  One yesterday called and said the Earth orbits around her and, you know, basically they're the Queen of England and that's the end of it.
[01:08:14.804 --> 01:08:19.148]  And they call in here and then we don't screen your calls and they lie and say we do.
[01:08:19.208 --> 01:08:20.169]  John Harmon, come in here.
[01:08:20.928 --> 01:08:22.890]  Yeah, the question was, do we screen calls?
[01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:23.932]  And she answered, yes.
[01:08:24.873 --> 01:08:29.738]  I did recognize her voice because she calls in every day, but that doesn't mean we screen calls.
[01:08:29.758 --> 01:08:30.459]  We put her on air.
[01:08:30.519 --> 01:08:31.300]  I don't know who she is.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.061]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:32.081 --> 01:08:35.505]  We put her on air, asked for her name and where she's calling from, and that's it.
[01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:36.366]  And she volunteered.
[01:08:36.406 --> 01:08:39.129]  She said she disagreed with you and Tarpley.
[01:08:40.184 --> 01:08:42.645]  So she went to the head of the line, and that was it.
[01:08:43.065 --> 01:08:47.687]  Okay, well that's a rarity, because I don't recognize her as a routine call that you did know who she was.
[01:08:48.087 --> 01:08:52.569]  Ma'am, we put you on air for her to then accuse us of being bad, and it's just a diversion.
[01:08:52.589 --> 01:08:58.332]  You have dollars imploding, everything's falling apart, and a bunch of people out there can't stay focused on real issues.
[01:08:58.972 --> 01:09:05.835]  Alex, we have schizophrenia, of course, but then we have the most dangerous form of schizophrenia is megalomania.
[01:09:06.155 --> 01:09:06.335]  Right?
[01:09:06.556 --> 01:09:09.078]  The Emperor, Nero, Napoleon, people like that.
[01:09:09.098 --> 01:09:10.059]  And that's what Obama has.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.541]  That's what Obama has, absolutely.
[01:09:12.302 --> 01:09:21.973]  Yeah, my whole issue is that this is a show, a platform for you, the listeners, and our guests, and I take a call and it's
[01:09:23.234 --> 01:09:24.655]  You know, we know who she is.
[01:09:24.955 --> 01:09:25.855]  I don't know who you are, ma'am.
[01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:29.636]  And that you're saying that we won't say who really runs things, but then you won't.
[01:09:29.956 --> 01:09:34.418]  You could have said whatever you wanted here, but you chose to do that, and that's part of the meltdown of our society.
[01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:36.199]  Let's talk to Lynn in Toronto.
[01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:37.439]  Lynn, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:40.680]  Go ahead, Lynn.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.501]  Hiya, I'm not an ex-queen at all, I'm just Lynn.
[01:09:43.621 --> 01:09:44.982]  Lynn, did we screen your phone call?
[01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:48.271]  Nope, he just said, thank you, please hold, I'll put you through.
[01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:50.413]  Now I'm tired of being accused of this, go ahead.
[01:09:50.573 --> 01:10:12.372]  At no point have you screened my numbers, you know, and that woman, she seems to me, she could not be specific about anything, you know, and I find the people I'm fighting with up here, same thing, they hit you with a bunch of things, and I think just trying to make... What's happening is, some of the zombies are being woken up, and I'm not trying to be mean to this lady, but I mean others, and they know the government's bad now, but then they can't tell what else is going on.
[01:10:12.632 --> 01:10:13.693]  Tarpley, you ever run into that?
[01:10:14.901 --> 01:10:16.763]  Well, you have these Obama trolls, right?
[01:10:16.804 --> 01:10:17.645]  That's what I find.
[01:10:18.065 --> 01:10:19.427]  Oh, you think that might be it?
[01:10:19.467 --> 01:10:20.268]  She doesn't like it?
[01:10:20.288 --> 01:10:21.269]  Yeah, sure.
[01:10:21.349 --> 01:10:24.153]  As soon as you're wrapping Obama, a bunch of trolls come out of the woodwork.
[01:10:24.433 --> 01:10:26.075]  Oh, he didn't win in Ohio, did he?
[01:10:27.009 --> 01:10:29.489]  I'd love to know who took over Ohio.
[01:10:29.549 --> 01:10:32.890]  I would have liked to name the names, but maybe another time.
[01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:34.350]  Yeah, but what we're censoring here.
[01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:36.371]  Okay, anything else?
[01:10:36.471 --> 01:10:43.952]  Yeah, I was just going to say, you know, you're always talking about the police and, you know, the fact they're not educated properly and dangerous here and dangerous there.
[01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:48.133]  No one ever talks about a group of people, like up here in Canada, we've got them.
[01:10:48.173 --> 01:10:56.134]  It's a private corporation and they now have police powers and they're very, very anti-public, like very, very anti-the people.
[01:10:56.733 --> 01:10:58.555]  And totally unaccountable.
[01:10:58.575 --> 01:11:00.637]  Yeah, they're setting up these citizen squads.
[01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:01.578]  They have them in England now.
[01:11:02.178 --> 01:11:04.781]  Well, this comes in the form of what they call a humane society.
[01:11:04.801 --> 01:11:07.363]  The Toronto Group operated legally for many years.
[01:11:07.768 --> 01:11:10.752]  And the government here in Ontario totally sucks up to them.
[01:11:11.052 --> 01:11:11.372]  Totally.
[01:11:11.432 --> 01:11:12.774]  And I'm sitting back and saying, why?
[01:11:12.814 --> 01:11:14.376]  They don't give a damn about animals.
[01:11:14.656 --> 01:11:17.079]  Why are they supporting groups who couldn't care less?
[01:11:17.099 --> 01:11:18.561]  They've devastated people here in Ontario.
[01:11:18.581 --> 01:11:25.108]  Well, they'll use something that sounds reasonable like animals to get you in the process of tattling and spying, then they move it over into regular spying.
[01:11:25.288 --> 01:11:25.989]  Do you agree, Webster?
[01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:35.177]  Again, I think that the big danger right now is this idea of grassroots movements around extreme ecology, animal rights, anything like this.
[01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:38.479]  This can become the breeding ground for the next generation of false flags.
[01:11:38.519 --> 01:11:40.981]  Folks, the book is Obama, the Postmodern Coup.
[01:11:41.402 --> 01:11:42.402]  Webster Griffin Tarbley.
[01:11:42.442 --> 01:11:43.723]  Webster, you're doing a great job.
[01:11:43.944 --> 01:11:46.906]  Let me have you up again in the next few weeks for another interview so we can finish up, okay?
[01:11:46.966 --> 01:11:48.107]  I'd be delighted, Alex.
[01:11:48.147 --> 01:11:48.687]  Thank you very much.
[01:11:48.707 --> 01:11:50.329]  All right, we're going to call you today and set you back up.
[01:11:50.349 --> 01:11:50.989]  Thank you, Webster.
[01:11:51.449 --> 01:11:52.510]  All right, we'll be back.
[01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:55.593]  I've got a key Willie Nelson announcement and then Mark Hornke.
[01:11:56.701 --> 01:12:09.413]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:12:09.853 --> 01:12:13.677]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[01:12:14.017 --> 01:12:20.522]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:12:20.902 --> 01:12:23.844]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:12:24.305 --> 01:12:31.810]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:37.414]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:12:37.614 --> 01:12:41.317]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts
[01:12:41.517 --> 01:12:42.138]  We're good to go.
[01:12:58.328 --> 01:12:59.389]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:12:59.790 --> 01:13:05.275]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:13:05.836 --> 01:13:06.336]  That's right.
[01:13:06.657 --> 01:13:08.939]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:16.427]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:13:16.977 --> 01:13:24.668]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:29.916]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:13:30.578 --> 01:13:35.602]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:36.402 --> 01:13:40.525]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:13:40.925 --> 01:13:41.185]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:41.225 --> 01:13:43.107]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:43.487]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:13:43.787 --> 01:13:44.047]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:56.796 --> 01:14:03.262]  I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business, when one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned, and he says, Wow!
[01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:05.224]  Have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[01:14:05.244 --> 01:14:06.004]  And I said, Oh, of course.
[01:14:06.465 --> 01:14:06.805]  Woo!
[01:14:06.845 --> 01:14:07.305]  They're high!
[01:14:07.706 --> 01:14:08.186]  He says, Yeah.
[01:14:08.206 --> 01:14:09.007]  He says, What am I going to do?
[01:14:09.307 --> 01:14:09.848]  I've got a truck.
[01:14:09.868 --> 01:14:12.470]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:14.392]  I really need the truck for my job.
[01:14:14.712 --> 01:14:16.393]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[01:14:16.714 --> 01:14:18.675]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[01:14:18.956 --> 01:14:20.317]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[01:14:20.617 --> 01:14:21.398]  I don't know what to do.
[01:14:21.738 --> 01:14:22.639]  I said, Bob, relax.
[01:14:22.779 --> 01:14:23.440]  I know what to do.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:28.122]  Call eFoodsDirect.com or go up on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:14:28.322 --> 01:14:38.486]  They will deliver food, really good, high-quality, nutritional, delicious food to your door, your door now, right there in front of your house, for about half the price that you were paying for groceries last year.
[01:14:38.847 --> 01:14:46.430]  You can take the savings from that, offset the cost of your fuel, and use it to buy more inexpensive food to hedge against tomorrow's increasing food prices.
[01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:47.651]  Why don't you do that, Bob?
[01:14:47.891 --> 01:14:49.413]  He said, eFoodsDirect.com?
[01:14:49.473 --> 01:14:49.913]  I said, yep.
[01:14:49.953 --> 01:14:52.595]  Call them at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:14:52.615 --> 01:14:53.136]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:14:53.256 --> 01:14:55.678]  Do it now.
[01:14:56.299 --> 01:15:01.964]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:15:02.244 --> 01:15:07.028]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[01:15:07.289 --> 01:15:11.012]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline
[01:15:11.152 --> 01:15:11.452]  I think so.
[01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:30.115]  Of course!
[01:16:03.394 --> 01:16:04.414]  We're good.
[01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:38.512]  We're going to be putting out more information by the end of the week, more specifics.
[01:16:39.513 --> 01:16:49.078]  You'll probably hear Willie Nelson back on Friday or maybe even on the Sunday show to announce it in his own words.
[01:16:50.759 --> 01:16:56.842]  You know, he was here in studio with us last Wednesday.
[01:16:57.663 --> 01:16:59.044]  We had him on air last Wednesday.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.845]  And I had been wanting to have him on about the impeachment hearings about, you know, pushing to not attack Iran.
[01:17:04.885 --> 01:17:06.968]  I called him up that Wednesday and said, well, I'll just come on today.
[01:17:07.528 --> 01:17:09.931]  So we had him on, and a caller called in.
[01:17:09.951 --> 01:17:14.195]  I thought about this privately, but subconsciously didn't want all the work and the craziness of a big event.
[01:17:14.536 --> 01:17:17.299]  Plus, I don't like asking celebrities for things very often.
[01:17:17.319 --> 01:17:21.323]  And the caller says, why don't you have some type of anti-war slash 9-11 truth event?
[01:17:22.857 --> 01:17:25.158]  And Willie Nelson said, I do that in a minute.
[01:17:25.518 --> 01:17:26.378]  So I said, well, let's do it.
[01:17:26.398 --> 01:17:29.399]  And on air he said, OK, let's look at seeing if we can do it.
[01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:35.961]  And Willie isn't somebody who, I mean, everything you've heard about him is really the way he is.
[01:17:35.981 --> 01:17:41.063]  I mean, somebody can drive by and flip him off and throw something in his car and he'll say, well, that fellow's having a bad day.
[01:17:41.103 --> 01:17:43.064]  I mean, he's really just smooth, great guy.
[01:17:44.881 --> 01:17:56.886]  And he's been anti-establishment for a long time, but I've now learned for ten years he's been listening to the show, watching the TV show in Austin, he lives here most of the year in Hawaii, the rest of it, and really woke up to the New World Order.
[01:17:56.906 --> 01:17:59.708]  And then I was having an event a few
[01:18:00.948 --> 01:18:05.111]  I guess about eight months ago, when Endgame came out, and all of a sudden people said, Willie Nelson's here!
[01:18:05.131 --> 01:18:05.631]  And I was like, yeah, right.
[01:18:05.651 --> 01:18:12.095]  And all of a sudden Willie Nelson walked around the back counter where I was signing DVDs and shook my hand and said, I really appreciate the great job you're doing.
[01:18:12.955 --> 01:18:15.737]  And I gave him my info, he gave me his, and he said, I'll be talking to you.
[01:18:16.077 --> 01:18:18.779]  A few months later he called me and then was a guest on the show and the rest is history.
[01:18:19.679 --> 01:18:25.643]  But to make a long story short, I started talking to him Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[01:18:26.944 --> 01:18:28.104]  We are doing an event.
[01:18:29.325 --> 01:18:29.946]  It's locked in.
[01:18:31.352 --> 01:18:37.808]  and uh... it is going to be a free event it is going to be free a free Willie Nelson event
[01:18:39.913 --> 01:18:46.259]  And he is basically, I said, hey, you're the boss, you tell me what to do or you have somebody else do it and I'll try to, you know, raise the money for the free event or whatever.
[01:18:46.279 --> 01:18:46.719]  He said, no.
[01:18:47.279 --> 01:18:49.361]  He said, you know, you just basically run it.
[01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:51.423]  Invite a bunch of big bands.
[01:18:51.603 --> 01:18:52.724]  I'll invite some friends of mine.
[01:18:53.325 --> 01:18:55.647]  Once they hear I'm involved, a lot of big groups are going to want to come.
[01:18:55.667 --> 01:18:59.230]  He's got Firemaid coming up with Neil Young and a bunch of other people, September 20th.
[01:18:59.690 --> 01:19:01.111]  This is going to be in October.
[01:19:01.191 --> 01:19:04.034]  I will tell you that it is going to be in October.
[01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:07.194]  That is when you're going to have this event.
[01:19:08.175 --> 01:19:11.119]  I was going to announce it tomorrow, but things got nailed down today.
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:20.631]  But still, for reasons of espionage and other things, I'm not going to get into specifics probably until Friday or maybe even next week.
[01:19:21.522 --> 01:19:26.528]  But this kind of emails I get from Willie, I've talked to him of course personally over the phone, but emails as well back and forth.
[01:19:26.568 --> 01:19:31.293]  Why don't you put out the word that we are looking for other acts and let's see who wants to play.
[01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:33.135]  I think there'll be a lot, thanks Willie.
[01:19:33.495 --> 01:19:34.997]  And that's in response to my email.
[01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:37.820]  I'm glad that we've nailed down the date.
[01:19:38.341 --> 01:19:40.403]  I'm going to call Ventura tomorrow to give him the date.
[01:19:40.423 --> 01:19:41.544]  I gotta do that when I get off air today.
[01:19:42.826 --> 01:19:50.172]  The bleep of 11 is only two and a half months away, so I don't want to wait too long getting the details on how you want this to go down.
[01:19:50.192 --> 01:19:52.114]  And that was the response to this that he sent me here.
[01:19:52.734 --> 01:19:54.736]  And also, he said he wants it to be a free event.
[01:19:55.577 --> 01:19:56.778]  Another email yesterday.
[01:19:56.798 --> 01:19:58.740]  I'm supposed to call in the last two days.
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.401]  I'm so busy I can't even call Willie Nelson up.
[01:20:00.421 --> 01:20:02.383]  I'm going to be doing that after the show today.
[01:20:04.205 --> 01:20:05.165]  And I've got to call Ventura.
[01:20:05.185 --> 01:20:07.227]  He already said he would come in September or October.
[01:20:07.267 --> 01:20:08.849]  He leaves back to Mexico in November.
[01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:12.147]  Ventura going public for 9-11 Truth here.
[01:20:12.187 --> 01:20:15.770]  You may see some other big people go public for 9-11 Truth at this.
[01:20:16.210 --> 01:20:25.718]  It's going to be about 80% don't attack Iran, don't take us into World War III, but it's also going to be 9-11 Truth when you've got a Ventura and some other surprise guests that are going to be coming.
[01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:27.360]  And this stuff falls right in my lap.
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:29.662]  I mean, it is providence, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:30.603 --> 01:20:31.804]  It is providence and
[01:20:32.941 --> 01:20:37.145]  We could have a paid event for $10 or whatever, guaranteed $30,000 or $40,000 will show up.
[01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:42.330]  The place we've got can take $60,000, but there's not parking for $60,000.
[01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:43.391]  There's parking for about $35,000.
[01:20:44.292 --> 01:20:51.398]  So folks, you better understand that you're going to have to get bussed in or something to this, because this sucker's capacity is exactly $60,000.
[01:20:52.039 --> 01:20:55.362]  And I think we're going to fill it.
[01:20:55.942 --> 01:20:58.404]  So, I mean, this is going to be absolutely incredible.
[01:20:59.415 --> 01:21:00.717]  Alejandro Jones.
[01:21:02.199 --> 01:21:03.481]  Willie's coming in with his whole band.
[01:21:03.501 --> 01:21:06.525]  Some other big people are probably going to be coming in.
[01:21:06.685 --> 01:21:08.007]  That's a big donation for them.
[01:21:08.307 --> 01:21:11.531]  I mean, their crews are costing them 20, 30 grand per event.
[01:21:12.152 --> 01:21:13.574]  So they're already giving huge amounts.
[01:21:13.634 --> 01:21:15.016]  Willie is and everybody else through that.
[01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:15.897]  I've got a...
[01:21:16.858 --> 01:21:19.118]  I'm just going to spend my kids' college money on this.
[01:21:19.158 --> 01:21:22.119]  No, we're probably going to have t-shirt sales there.
[01:21:22.159 --> 01:21:22.999]  Hopefully that'll pay for it.
[01:21:23.019 --> 01:21:23.719]  If not, I'm going to pay for it.
[01:21:23.999 --> 01:21:25.520]  I'm not going to ask for donations for it at this time.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.500]  It's just, we're doing it.
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:27.500]  It's free, baby.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.741]  And that's the way it goes.
[01:21:29.861 --> 01:21:30.381]  Ha ha!
[01:21:30.881 --> 01:21:33.281]  And I'm not going to let anybody in on exactly the date yet.
[01:21:33.781 --> 01:21:35.762]  But you'll probably hear Nelson pop in in the near future.
[01:21:36.302 --> 01:21:36.942]  What a show today.
[01:21:36.982 --> 01:21:37.942]  Webster Tarpley.
[01:21:37.982 --> 01:21:41.403]  We've had Stan Monteith and Lindsey Williams on.
[01:21:41.883 --> 01:21:44.584]  We've got Webster Tarpley coming on again next week.
[01:21:44.604 --> 01:21:46.264]  And we've got Mark Kornke in studio.
[01:21:46.624 --> 01:21:47.005]  Hold on.
[01:21:47.045 --> 01:21:48.586]  Hey, I want you to come in.
[01:21:54.366 --> 01:21:58.748]  Come in with that, uh... I'm not going to ask for donations for it at this time, it's just... We're doing it!
[01:21:58.988 --> 01:21:59.789]  It's free, baby!
[01:22:00.469 --> 01:22:01.990]  And, uh, that's the way it goes!
[01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.650]  Ha-ha!
[01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:08.032]  And I'm not going to let anybody in on exactly the date yet, but you'll probably hear Nelson pop in in the near future.
[01:22:08.573 --> 01:22:09.213]  What a show today!
[01:22:09.253 --> 01:22:13.675]  Webster Tarpley, we've had, uh... Stan Monteith and Lindsey Williams on.
[01:22:14.155 --> 01:22:18.597]  We've got Webster, uh, Tarpley coming on again next week, and we've got Mark Kornegay in studio!
[01:22:18.837 --> 01:22:19.738]  We're on the march.
[01:22:20.218 --> 01:22:21.739]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:22:22.731 --> 01:22:25.534]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:31.459]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[01:22:31.779 --> 01:22:33.581]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[01:22:33.841 --> 01:22:35.943]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[01:22:36.163 --> 01:22:39.446]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the Antichrist.
[01:22:39.726 --> 01:22:43.149]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the Antichrist?
[01:22:43.489 --> 01:22:47.093]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[01:22:47.433 --> 01:22:49.615]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo,
[01:22:49.935 --> 01:22:55.298]  The National ID Card, or 666, is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[01:22:55.658 --> 01:22:57.299]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[01:22:57.599 --> 01:22:59.060]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:02.582]  1 John states, the Antichrist is already in the world.
[01:23:02.862 --> 01:23:04.723]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:07.044]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[01:23:07.364 --> 01:23:09.125]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[01:23:09.365 --> 01:23:16.029]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its mark, write to The Bible Says.
[01:23:16.349 --> 01:23:17.732]  Box 99, Lenoir City, Tennessee, 37771.
[01:23:17.832 --> 01:23:18.273]  Or call 888-211-1715.
[01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:18.574]  That's 888-211-1715.
[01:23:29.582 --> 01:23:33.044]  Attention please, I've come with a message of information.
[01:23:33.065 --> 01:23:35.726]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:23:35.746 --> 01:23:36.867]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:38.508]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:23:38.608 --> 01:23:41.451]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:23:41.511 --> 01:23:45.153]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:23:54.815 --> 01:23:59.628]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:02.092]  Are you sad, John?
[01:24:03.453 --> 01:24:04.493]  How dare you?
[01:24:05.894 --> 01:24:10.978]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:24:11.138 --> 01:24:13.400]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:20.305]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.
[01:24:20.345 --> 01:24:22.907]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:24:23.187 --> 01:24:25.189]  Or get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:25.449 --> 01:24:27.931]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:24:28.331 --> 01:24:31.393]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:24:31.773 --> 01:24:33.835]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:24:34.075 --> 01:24:37.077]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:24:37.377 --> 01:24:43.861]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:24:44.261 --> 01:24:46.463]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:24:46.883 --> 01:24:49.965]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:24:50.165 --> 01:24:54.808]  I just talk to clients on the phone, and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:24:54.948 --> 01:24:56.609]  So I can travel the world and still
[01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:22.142]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[01:25:22.202 --> 01:25:26.646]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which
[01:25:27.532 --> 01:25:31.234]  By any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[01:25:31.734 --> 01:25:33.555]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:25:37.297 --> 01:25:39.118]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:25:42.861 --> 01:25:44.662]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:25:48.023 --> 01:25:50.945]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[01:25:51.205 --> 01:25:53.426]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[01:25:53.546 --> 01:25:56.008]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:25:58.183 --> 01:26:04.128]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[01:26:04.528 --> 01:26:11.314]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:26:11.434 --> 01:26:16.418]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[01:26:16.578 --> 01:26:19.340]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:23.543]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[01:26:23.643 --> 01:26:26.606]  We're gonna have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[01:26:27.919 --> 01:26:31.824]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[01:26:32.044 --> 01:26:32.705]  Well, join me.
[01:26:33.266 --> 01:26:35.368]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:37.451]  There's a need for a new world order.
[01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:45.360]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[01:27:07.403 --> 01:27:13.328]  Willie Nelson was saying in an email last night to go ahead and announce it.
[01:27:14.489 --> 01:27:22.256]  Then I got another one from him about 10 minutes ago that I just read during the break about another location.
[01:27:22.316 --> 01:27:23.898]  So, you know what?
[01:27:25.635 --> 01:27:27.196]  It might be a place with 20,000, a place with 60,000.
[01:27:27.236 --> 01:27:28.658]  We're trying to nail this down.
[01:27:28.678 --> 01:27:31.920]  So whoever puts a YouTube together, my earlier announcement, make sure that it's on there.
[01:27:32.381 --> 01:27:40.747]  That's why this stuff just makes me pull my hair out, because that's why I don't even subconsciously want to do things like this, because then I have to worry about making sure it comes off right.
[01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:45.752]  We were just playing Walter Cronkite, calling for world government and saying he sits at the right hand of Satan.
[01:27:45.772 --> 01:27:48.914]  These people are in your face, another Bohemian Grove member.
[01:27:50.075 --> 01:27:51.136]  What a wild day!
[01:27:51.156 --> 01:27:53.158]  I found out last night
[01:27:54.218 --> 01:27:56.059]  Because one of my engineers went down to the event.
[01:27:56.099 --> 01:27:57.900]  He called me and said, Oh, I was just down at Brave New Books.
[01:27:58.981 --> 01:27:59.942]  Mark Kornke was in town.
[01:27:59.982 --> 01:28:01.723]  I said, Oh, is it still going?
[01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:02.723]  He said, No, it's about to end.
[01:28:02.764 --> 01:28:04.805]  I don't have time to go down there, but I want to meet him in person.
[01:28:04.825 --> 01:28:05.665]  I feel like I know him.
[01:28:05.685 --> 01:28:09.448]  I've interviewed him so many times over the years, going back into the mid-90s.
[01:28:09.528 --> 01:28:14.091]  And then when he got back out of prison being set up now, I said, Try to set him up for tomorrow.
[01:28:14.111 --> 01:28:15.412]  Well, they were able to get him before he left town.
[01:28:16.112 --> 01:28:17.113]  He's with us for the rest of this hour.
[01:28:17.133 --> 01:28:19.254]  And we're going to go into overdrive today.
[01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:23.216]  We're on AM and FM right now, but in about 25 minutes, the main transmission will end.
[01:28:23.236 --> 01:28:24.797]  But we'll do about 20 minutes of overdrive.
[01:28:25.298 --> 01:28:27.399]  I'd do 5 hours of overdrive if Corky could do it.
[01:28:27.459 --> 01:28:34.764]  Also, I have to deal with this concert and about 10 other insane things that are going on right now.
[01:28:35.684 --> 01:28:36.765]  So as we try to
[01:28:38.325 --> 01:28:46.050]  Finally nailed down this concert that's going on, and I want it to be free, they want it to be free too, but who knows what's going to happen here when you're dealing with superstars like this.
[01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:51.333]  But getting into the whole geopolitical realm, Mark Kornke, in studio with us.
[01:28:51.393 --> 01:28:52.593]  Mark, good to have you here.
[01:28:52.633 --> 01:28:53.854]  Hey, nice to have you, Alex.
[01:28:53.914 --> 01:29:00.358]  You know what, it's always fun to be down here, because down here in Texas we know it's the big state, and it's got big hearts, and we've got big hospitality.
[01:29:00.378 --> 01:29:02.139]  That's exactly what we've seen all the while we've been here.
[01:29:02.199 --> 01:29:03.439]  We're down here going crazy, man.
[01:29:03.559 --> 01:29:07.100]  And getting hot, too, because, guys, you can fry out on the pavement right now.
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:09.581]  Not quite as much as Arizona, but it's getting close there.
[01:29:09.641 --> 01:29:13.982]  So we brought eggs, bacon, and if it's a little warmer here after one, we'll do just fine.
[01:29:14.122 --> 01:29:15.602]  But, yeah, it's been a great time.
[01:29:15.703 --> 01:29:16.063]  We've been here.
[01:29:16.083 --> 01:29:16.623]  Appreciate it.
[01:29:16.643 --> 01:29:21.224]  And I want to say thank you to all the people who made it possible, because, you know, we've been flying on the cuff.
[01:29:21.324 --> 01:29:22.684]  We haven't really set a schedule.
[01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:24.645]  Everybody that's needed us here, we've taken care of it.
[01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:27.322]  Mark, you're here in person.
[01:29:27.422 --> 01:29:42.859]  What has it been like in your life when she woke up to the New World Order in the late 80s and now, you know, being one of the leaders of the re-founding of the Patriot community exploding in the 90s, being sent to prison on trumped-up charges with the police on their own squad car running off the road.
[01:29:42.879 --> 01:29:46.043]  I mean, it's been quite a saga for you and I think it's just beginning.
[01:29:46.559 --> 01:30:04.753]  Well, we've actually been very, very busy, as you know, and as you get into this, you find out there's so much more to do, and that's exciting in and of itself, because you get a chance to meet all the people that are out there, and there's a lot of people, like you said, that have been in this before us, that passed the torch on, and we're now doing the job that they did at one time.
[01:30:04.873 --> 01:30:06.715]  In fact, they didn't have the tools we have.
[01:30:07.055 --> 01:30:10.638]  Look at the great trinkets we have to work with, that way they get the word out.
[01:30:10.738 --> 01:30:13.320]  In the past, remember, it used to be, would you like to see a mimeograph?
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:15.480]  Think about a U.N.
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.201]  document, State Department document 7277.
[01:30:17.241 --> 01:30:20.443]  Right, exactly, and it would be the one thing that they had to work with.
[01:30:20.483 --> 01:30:26.325]  Today, we have virtually every media tool at our disposal that our enemy hoped to manipulate and control.
[01:30:26.405 --> 01:30:33.509]  And our enemy was in the old mindset where they could go to a world governance conference and where all these world leaders and Walter Cronkite could call for world government.
[01:30:33.549 --> 01:30:36.350]  Now we can go get those old tapes and string 20 of them together with
[01:30:36.610 --> 01:30:39.351]  Prime Ministers and leaders calling for it and saying, oh, that doesn't exist.
[01:30:39.671 --> 01:30:43.652]  Or we can, through Judicial Watch, go sue and get North American Union documents.
[01:30:43.672 --> 01:30:46.533]  In the past we did that, but you said to hand them out.
[01:30:46.593 --> 01:30:47.413]  Now we can give them to millions.
[01:30:47.593 --> 01:30:47.833]  Right.
[01:30:47.853 --> 01:30:53.255]  And the other fascinating thing is, don't forget that while Walter was telling you all about certain things from one direction, he's also the right hand of Satan!
[01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:55.136]  In his own words.
[01:30:55.156 --> 01:30:56.136]  Can you believe he said that?
[01:30:57.287 --> 01:31:04.830]  Well, again, you know, we remember, wasn't it with Bohemian Grove, as I recall, who was the voice in the background for so many years?
[01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:05.910]  Walter Cronkite.
[01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:07.111]  So, let's see.
[01:31:07.131 --> 01:31:07.871]  Don't care!
[01:31:08.111 --> 01:31:22.937]  So, do you think, when people use certain words, especially when you see a statement made like that, even if he was trying to work off the cuff, that inventory, that process that he used that became a public statement, was sitting somewhere in his subconscious in some way.
[01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:24.918]  He didn't just pull that out of his back pocket.
[01:31:26.617 --> 01:31:32.881]  Usually that represents or demonstrates a mindset, a track, an ideology, a school of thought.
[01:31:33.942 --> 01:31:38.365]  And when you capture it like that, they figure it's a nano-moment that will never be captured and brought back again.
[01:31:38.425 --> 01:31:39.786]  After all, it's futile resistance.
[01:31:39.806 --> 01:31:41.627]  Because that was done before the internet age.
[01:31:41.667 --> 01:31:42.087]  That's right.
[01:31:42.127 --> 01:31:45.329]  Now we brought it back from the end of the future.
[01:31:45.449 --> 01:31:47.551]  And that's one of the things for a lot of your listeners right now.
[01:31:47.591 --> 01:31:50.593]  There's a lot of new people that are out there listening maybe for the first time.
[01:31:51.293 --> 01:31:54.035]  But let's say that they've gotten to the internet because they're retired.
[01:31:55.103 --> 01:32:04.829]  Now, you're listening out there right now and you have a collection of beta tapes, or VHS tapes, or you were in an industry where you even saved part of what you did reel-to-reel.
[01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:07.250]  Or old satellite feeds.
[01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:07.851]  That's right.
[01:32:07.931 --> 01:32:15.115]  There are old files sitting there where people are listening, and when you hear what you hear on the programming like this during the breaks or when we come back... It hits a tumbler.
[01:32:15.355 --> 01:32:15.555]  Right.
[01:32:15.695 --> 01:32:19.618]  We need your help, too, because you may have the rest of what we don't have.
[01:32:20.663 --> 01:32:25.465]  And remember that if you can access and work together with us, we're going to get it out.
[01:32:25.525 --> 01:32:27.985]  And now it won't be just that nanobyte back in 1964.
[01:32:29.306 --> 01:32:31.147]  Now it's the truth brought forward to the year 2008.
[01:32:33.027 --> 01:32:34.508]  Think of what a tool that is.
[01:32:34.968 --> 01:32:35.948]  And it's happening more and more.
[01:32:36.048 --> 01:32:36.468]  That's right.
[01:32:36.568 --> 01:32:39.629]  So it's changing the dynamics of the battlefield, which is what we've been doing.
[01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:41.730]  The other side, well, let's put it this way.
[01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:42.690]  I walk all over the place.
[01:32:43.251 --> 01:32:44.131]  I go all over the place.
[01:32:44.171 --> 01:32:47.172]  And I also make a point of doing something everybody listening should do.
[01:32:47.972 --> 01:32:49.693]  Do not hesitate to speak.
[01:32:50.882 --> 01:32:53.624]  Silence and inaction is consent.
[01:32:53.845 --> 01:32:54.285]  That's right.
[01:32:54.485 --> 01:32:55.486]  It is action.
[01:32:55.526 --> 01:32:56.587]  That's the best way to describe it.
[01:32:56.627 --> 01:32:59.389]  Remember, the lack of motion is not an inaction.
[01:32:59.429 --> 01:33:01.511]  The lack of motion is one of many choices.
[01:33:02.532 --> 01:33:06.175]  If you fail to move, your enemy can either... There are two situations.
[01:33:06.195 --> 01:33:06.816]  You can fail.
[01:33:06.856 --> 01:33:11.139]  You can stop the motion so that you allow your enemy to move into a position where you can attack them better.
[01:33:12.393 --> 01:33:16.874]  If you fail to move, and they're on the offensive, you simply become enveloped and overrun.
[01:33:17.154 --> 01:33:23.415]  Well, in this case, the whole idea, there's a lot of people out there with all this cool technology that they may have used in the past, and they're thinking, well, it's obsolete!
[01:33:23.455 --> 01:33:25.715]  I've got MP3, I've got... No!
[01:33:26.215 --> 01:33:37.357]  You have sound bites and you have bits of information and evidence that incriminate and demonstrate over and over again the true culpability of an enemy that we've been facing off and successfully working against.
[01:33:37.397 --> 01:33:39.258]  Think about what we've done in the last 20 years.
[01:33:39.678 --> 01:33:40.798]  Think about what we've done in the last 10 years.
[01:33:41.983 --> 01:33:51.163]  And again, look at the personalities that are coming forward, just like you've described in the program here, that are actually able to lever many, many other people.
[01:33:51.183 --> 01:33:51.885]  Now I'm going to say this.
[01:33:52.933 --> 01:33:53.794]  Alex, you've got a lot of people.
[01:33:53.834 --> 01:33:56.396]  If you have one personality that comes forward, consider this.
[01:33:56.456 --> 01:34:01.139]  It's kind of like when government says, well, I've got four letters in the mail, and people say, well, that's not significant.
[01:34:01.339 --> 01:34:01.699]  Wrong.
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:08.864]  The old formula was, if they got four letters on a subject, they knew that so many hundred thousand people were actually thinking the same thoughts.
[01:34:09.565 --> 01:34:16.430]  In every situation, just like with these personalities, if you're affecting one or two people that will more than willingly come forward and express their position,
[01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:25.416]  That means that there are hundreds if not thousands of others that, given that final push, become part of the wave that supports your effort.
[01:34:26.297 --> 01:34:27.437]  And that's what's happening right now.
[01:34:27.457 --> 01:34:28.758]  That's what you're on the edge of.
[01:34:28.858 --> 01:34:29.959]  Most everybody can see this.
[01:34:29.999 --> 01:34:30.520]  They sense it.
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:31.000]  They feel it.
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:31.460]  They smell it.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:31.941]  They touch it.
[01:34:31.961 --> 01:34:32.521]  They taste it.
[01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:36.724]  And that's where we are with why everybody must speak out.
[01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:40.106]  Don't worry about the character that was ridiculing you a year and a half ago.
[01:34:40.126 --> 01:34:40.887]  You know what he does now?
[01:34:41.427 --> 01:34:42.268]  He does this, Alex.
[01:34:42.548 --> 01:34:43.509]  He looks down at the ground.
[01:34:44.341 --> 01:34:48.144]  He'll look over anyone, but he will not look at you when you're speaking.
[01:34:48.164 --> 01:34:49.825]  Well, that is the phenomenon now.
[01:34:49.925 --> 01:34:50.165]  Yes.
[01:34:50.365 --> 01:34:53.547]  But not just looking down, so many people replanted those seeds.
[01:34:53.587 --> 01:35:00.572]  You know, in farming, you might have seeds from two years ago, ten years ago, six years ago, that are called volunteers.
[01:35:00.612 --> 01:35:01.493]  They sprout up later.
[01:35:01.973 --> 01:35:04.195]  Or they wash up underneath something and then wash back out.
[01:35:05.415 --> 01:35:06.316]  And that's the same thing.
[01:35:06.356 --> 01:35:07.877]  We've planted billions of seeds.
[01:35:08.357 --> 01:35:10.639]  Millions sprouted before, now millions more are sprouting.
[01:35:11.179 --> 01:35:13.821]  And it's almost like we're putting, in the infowar, landmines out.
[01:35:14.101 --> 01:35:16.122]  But these landmines don't kill people, they unlock minds.
[01:35:17.443 --> 01:35:18.244]  Knock down walls.
[01:35:18.324 --> 01:35:19.885]  Exactly, in people's minds.
[01:35:19.945 --> 01:35:25.228]  And so now, we have littered everything with these landmines, and it is unlocking people's minds.
[01:35:25.309 --> 01:35:30.452]  It is, you know, the tumblers are unlocking, and they're remembering everything we told them, everything we said, and it's all happening.
[01:35:30.712 --> 01:35:31.132]  Exactly.
[01:35:31.172 --> 01:35:34.595]  And the most important thing is, this is part of what is the first phase.
[01:35:34.695 --> 01:35:38.457]  For years I've argued, it's not like you just walk up a series of steps.
[01:35:39.218 --> 01:35:43.420]  Each tier, first of all, you've got to acknowledge the idea that something's different, something's wrong with your environment.
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:48.804]  And so that's like pulling yourself up to the next step with virtually every ounce of energy you have in your body.
[01:35:49.424 --> 01:35:52.026]  You think, ah, now I'm at the plateau where I can see everything.
[01:35:52.266 --> 01:35:54.548]  And what you see first is the next step.
[01:35:54.648 --> 01:35:58.150]  You realize as you've now opened your eyes, there's something else going on.
[01:35:58.638 --> 01:36:03.462]  Mark, what do you think we're going to see happen in the next six months, next year, next two years unfolding?
[01:36:03.522 --> 01:36:04.443]  I mean, give us your projection.
[01:36:04.483 --> 01:36:06.905]  Well, actually, again, we have the sliding timeline.
[01:36:06.925 --> 01:36:14.152]  Number one is we have Jorge Bush, the second, the best president Mexico has probably ever had, and will.
[01:36:14.592 --> 01:36:17.274]  We have perhaps a person looking to create a duchy out of Texas.
[01:36:17.995 --> 01:36:18.275]  I think?
[01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:32.651]  Not of his own accord.
[01:36:32.971 --> 01:36:36.334]  George Bush, if he starts a war with Iran, isn't doing it on his own accord.
[01:36:36.474 --> 01:36:38.475]  He's being told by somebody else to do this.
[01:36:39.496 --> 01:36:44.080]  As is traditionally the case, if he gets us into a conflict overseas, what's the argument?
[01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:45.241]  Well, we're already in it!
[01:36:45.301 --> 01:36:46.302]  What did we hear with Iraq?
[01:36:46.802 --> 01:36:48.664]  Well, now that we're in it, we can't back out!
[01:36:49.204 --> 01:36:53.367]  Now, getting us into Iran, especially being a... Isn't he a lame duck?
[01:36:54.388 --> 01:36:56.170]  That would be one option, but here's the problem.
[01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:59.993]  What if... Instead of being a lame duck, he becomes a lion?
[01:37:00.976 --> 01:37:03.078]  And decides to grab hold of the meat and stick.
[01:37:04.098 --> 01:37:05.499]  And that's the most realistic scenario.
[01:37:05.539 --> 01:37:18.609]  Between a combination of an attack inside the United States, a 9-11 type scenario, which everybody's been talking about, and an attack on Iran, which of course would be an aggressive, a war of aggression, just like the first war of aggression we've been in with Iraq.
[01:37:19.429 --> 01:37:24.833]  You're going to see a situation where there will be greater and greater response from outside the United States and the international community.
[01:37:25.374 --> 01:37:28.076]  Now, there's two attitudes, and we've already heard this, and you're seeing this.
[01:37:28.916 --> 01:37:31.398]  We need to take Americans to the international court.
[01:37:31.678 --> 01:37:32.959]  Now, I understand that that sounds good.
[01:37:32.979 --> 01:37:34.520]  And that sets the precedent for it.
[01:37:34.801 --> 01:37:35.821]  Well, it's the same thing in England.
[01:37:35.841 --> 01:37:40.745]  They have all this tyranny, and then the EU keeps ruling for liberty, but inside the EU it's total tyranny.
[01:37:40.945 --> 01:37:44.428]  They're only setting the precedent in people's minds that that's the court of justice.
[01:37:44.548 --> 01:37:49.872]  And then all of a sudden we go to a higher tier, alien to the United States, outside American jurisprudence.
[01:37:50.473 --> 01:37:54.035]  And so it's, for them, their perception is one way or another they can make this a win-win.
[01:37:54.055 --> 01:38:00.040]  In other words, how do you take and turn a, you know, a mud pie into a, you know, something edible?
[01:38:00.601 --> 01:38:12.250]  You have to, you know, one way or another, even though it looks bad for us, for them, they're directing the actions in such a way that if we decided that we're going to, well we can't really deal with this in the American system, we'll take him to the world court.
[01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:17.076]  Taking them to the world court means that we then have no... I mean, what's the appeals process for this?
[01:38:17.156 --> 01:38:17.677]  Where do you go?
[01:38:18.297 --> 01:38:25.006]  And how do you control or regulate a process that is so far away from the people that there is no control or regulation?
[01:38:25.367 --> 01:38:28.791]  That once, as we've already seen with centralized American government,
[01:38:29.512 --> 01:38:49.150]  If you let all the power gravitate to a position so far away you can't see what's going on, the scallywags gravitate there, how can anybody with any intelligence argue that the United Nations, the World Court, and all of these other structures, who would answer now to no one, wouldn't gravitate to the exact same policy that we are already complaining about with Washington?
[01:38:49.190 --> 01:38:50.331]  Well, they constantly do this.
[01:38:51.332 --> 01:38:53.593]  Clinton's so evil, Bush is going to come in and save us.
[01:38:53.673 --> 01:38:56.775]  Clinton's been so bad, now Bush is the savior.
[01:38:57.475 --> 01:39:03.358]  And then, okay, we get George Bush, and now he's been really bad, so Barack Obama is going to save us.
[01:39:03.398 --> 01:39:08.800]  And it's the same left-right paradigm, or Tory versus Labor, where they control both sides.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:12.342]  And I know this is simple to the listeners, but the general public doesn't understand this.
[01:39:12.382 --> 01:39:18.545]  It's literally just a new sheet of paper for the birdcage liner, and then after four to eight years, they remove that piece
[01:39:19.465 --> 01:39:22.367]  Or be it six years in England or whatever, and they just remove it.
[01:39:22.407 --> 01:39:23.888]  Same thing in Israel, same thing in Germany.
[01:39:24.849 --> 01:39:28.992]  We have to get back to basic issues to try to explain this to the public.
[01:39:29.372 --> 01:39:30.172]  Issues of liberty.
[01:39:30.893 --> 01:39:36.016]  But, you know, a lot of people thought Bill Clinton was going to go for martial law because we saw the plans, the executive orders, the gear up.
[01:39:36.237 --> 01:39:36.737]  He was there.
[01:39:36.777 --> 01:39:38.598]  But that started before even Reagan.
[01:39:38.958 --> 01:39:43.922]  It's just gotten bigger and bigger and bigger now where they could try it, but it may be a Barack Obama that does it.
[01:39:43.942 --> 01:39:44.962]  It may be a John McCain.
[01:39:45.002 --> 01:39:48.605]  But you're saying you think there's a lot of evidence that it may happen now.
[01:39:48.965 --> 01:39:51.086]  Well, that's the first window, is there's a sliding scale.
[01:39:51.166 --> 01:39:58.128]  If Bush decides to make the effort to do this, the problem that we have is how many people, for instance, in the military would actually go along with it.
[01:39:58.348 --> 01:40:03.870]  Well, if there's a terror attack, even if people are awake, it tends to make a lot of people who are on the fence go ahead and get in line.
[01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:04.150]  Right.
[01:40:04.410 --> 01:40:11.052]  The way that this would have to be done is, from the military perspective, and other people who are in agencies, even, who do not go along with or agree with what's happening,
[01:40:11.496 --> 01:40:18.181]  There would have to be a very quick containment bubble to restrict it from expanding into the crisis mode, which is what they want.
[01:40:18.261 --> 01:40:22.344]  And by the way, this isn't a radical thing we're saying under Nixon.
[01:40:22.624 --> 01:40:28.749]  The military and others, it was publicly said, and Congress said, do not launch any military operations, do not stage any events.
[01:40:28.949 --> 01:40:29.690]  Right, exactly.
[01:40:30.850 --> 01:40:33.972]  However, go back before that, just exactly something that everybody has disclosed.
[01:40:33.992 --> 01:40:35.053]  You've had it in your videos.
[01:40:35.853 --> 01:40:38.615]  Operation Northwood, which goes back before Nixon.
[01:40:38.715 --> 01:40:40.176]  And Kennedy said no, and they killed him.
[01:40:40.576 --> 01:40:44.498]  And that's where, again, now when people ask, well, why would they have said that to Nixon?
[01:40:45.179 --> 01:40:52.883]  Inside the system, they already understood, because of the documents that now have been declassified, they knew within the system that that was a possibility.
[01:40:52.923 --> 01:40:54.704]  In fact, it was a probability.
[01:40:54.864 --> 01:41:00.567]  On September 12th, in the Washington Post, they had a Pentagon report put out from the Navy.
[01:41:00.607 --> 01:41:07.891]  Remember that saying, Israel is capable of staging false flag, staged terror events as a pretext to launch a war in the Middle East.
[01:41:08.032 --> 01:41:08.432]  Exactly.
[01:41:08.552 --> 01:41:11.373]  Now again, we had those warnings, those leaks slipping out there.
[01:41:11.914 --> 01:41:16.516]  Somebody declassified Operation Northwoods when it wasn't supposed to be declassified, slipping things out.
[01:41:16.897 --> 01:41:19.178]  So we have a lot of friends inside the government.
[01:41:19.318 --> 01:41:29.425]  The system understands that this scenario, if it's played out, if you're an analyst of any kind, if you're a person working within the system in any way with authority or with responsibility,
[01:41:30.330 --> 01:41:33.212]  That you can walk through step-by-step to see the end result.
[01:41:33.252 --> 01:41:35.453]  And it's so obvious now, it goes back to H.G.
[01:41:35.494 --> 01:41:39.456]  Wells, what he stated in The Open Conspiracy.
[01:41:39.476 --> 01:41:44.800]  He said, at a given point, it would become so obvious that it would be impossible to hide the agenda.
[01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:58.369]  And that at that point, it would be the most dangerous for the Ringknockers, for the, you know, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderbergers, whoever, the Bilderbergs, in that what would happen is all of their actions could be seen by even the most naive of individuals, or at least they would ask questions.
[01:41:59.130 --> 01:42:01.252]  The problem is that they're not all-powerful.
[01:42:01.313 --> 01:42:02.514]  This is what people make a mistake on.
[01:42:02.554 --> 01:42:14.047]  They want everybody to believe that, but that goes back to the basic rules of warfare, be it European philosophy or Asian, that the basic rule is to convince your enemy that the war is lost before the first arrow has left the bow, as you said, Sun Tzu.
[01:42:14.067 --> 01:42:18.512]  But we're going to go to break and come back with a final main transmission, and then do 20 minutes if you can do it.
[01:42:20.813 --> 01:42:22.474]  Overdrive, just for internet audience alone.
[01:42:22.514 --> 01:42:25.595]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars stream listeners.
[01:42:26.615 --> 01:42:29.156]  But you're absolutely right about that, Mark.
[01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:33.738]  So we'll come back and get more into those issues with Mark Kornke.
[01:42:34.559 --> 01:42:35.919]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:42:36.559 --> 01:42:42.762]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:42:43.162 --> 01:42:45.243]  We'll also give you Mark's numbers.
[01:42:46.673 --> 01:42:47.734]  Before he leaves us.
[01:42:47.754 --> 01:42:52.055]  And we're going to come back and talk about Admiral Fallon and some of the other brass leaving.
[01:42:52.075 --> 01:42:53.696]  We'll get his take on what that means.
[01:42:53.716 --> 01:42:54.136]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.318 --> 01:43:03.621]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[01:43:03.981 --> 01:43:06.222]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[01:43:06.602 --> 01:43:10.044]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[01:43:10.264 --> 01:43:13.205]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,

[01:43:32.717 --> 01:43:34.779]  Laser technology at its best.
[01:43:34.999 --> 01:43:38.181]  To receive an information packet, call our treatment center at 501-255
[01:43:40.483 --> 01:43:40.823]  Thank you.
[01:43:56.252 --> 01:43:57.933]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:43:58.233 --> 01:44:01.655]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:44:01.836 --> 01:44:03.717]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:44:04.297 --> 01:44:07.019]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:44:07.339 --> 01:44:12.802]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:44:13.062 --> 01:44:16.985]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:44:17.305 --> 01:44:22.227]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:44:22.507 --> 01:44:25.267]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:44:43.533 --> 01:44:46.076]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[01:44:46.436 --> 01:44:48.097]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:48.478 --> 01:44:50.260]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:52.262]  Put them on the file sharing networks.

[01:44:54.384 --> 01:44:55.144]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:44:56.334 --> 01:44:59.277]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:44:59.437 --> 01:45:04.681]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:45:04.961 --> 01:45:10.326]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:45:10.666 --> 01:45:11.787]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:45:12.147 --> 01:45:21.055]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:45:21.455 --> 01:45:23.097]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:45:23.297 --> 01:45:27.482]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:46:11.752 --> 01:46:15.855]  Final segment, the main radio broadcast with Mark Hornky, who's here in town.
[01:46:15.915 --> 01:46:17.796]  It's great to be able to meet him in person.
[01:46:17.836 --> 01:46:20.097]  All these years talking to him over the telephone or on the radio.
[01:46:23.119 --> 01:46:25.241]  We're going to have him on with us for 20 minutes.
[01:46:26.342 --> 01:46:28.243]  That's the 3.20 Central Standard Time.
[01:46:29.821 --> 01:46:37.105]  In fact, I'm going to give you my local studio number for anybody that wants to call in and talk to Mark in that commercial-free segment.
[01:46:37.866 --> 01:46:45.610]  Then on the web, the rebroadcast will begin from the first three and a half hours of the show with Lindsey Williams.
[01:46:45.650 --> 01:46:51.314]  We have back on today Dr. Stan Monteith, Webster Griffin Tarpley, and of course Steve Watson as well.
[01:46:51.734 --> 01:46:53.695]  And that's the issues I wanted to bring up to you, Mark.
[01:46:53.755 --> 01:46:55.036]  He opens up the Sunday paper.
[01:46:56.388 --> 01:46:58.109]  In England, Steve Watson lives in London.
[01:46:58.730 --> 01:47:00.731]  British kids encouraged to become climate cops.
[01:47:00.771 --> 01:47:02.592]  You go to the website, they wear uniforms.
[01:47:03.813 --> 01:47:06.875]  It says, report on your parents, build, it's climatecops.com.
[01:47:07.816 --> 01:47:11.378]  They build a dossier on your parents, you spy on them and report back to the government.
[01:47:11.978 --> 01:47:13.619]  This is what Barack Obama is calling for.
[01:47:13.639 --> 01:47:16.841]  Everything we've said, but they're really announcing it right now.
[01:47:16.901 --> 01:47:17.282]  Your take.
[01:47:17.822 --> 01:47:21.563]  Well, it's interesting, that's exactly where I'd go is, isn't it fascinating?
[01:47:21.603 --> 01:47:26.705]  Most people say, well this is a unique idea by this dynamic individual who just pulled this out of his hind end.
[01:47:26.765 --> 01:47:28.245]  It was a plastic bag, okay?
[01:47:28.625 --> 01:47:32.407]  It was very messy, very stinky, but he took the plastic bag off and look what he discovered!
[01:47:32.787 --> 01:47:42.430]  When in reality what we see is, and they don't expect this to happen, is for everybody to be able to demonstrate a coordinated effort by a series of individuals who supposedly are disassociated.
[01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:44.651]  Remember, they'll say, I don't know who that guy is.
[01:47:45.071 --> 01:47:53.495]  Well, wait a minute, okay, the exact same thing that you just proposed here in the United States, this shyster over in England just dropped in everybody's lap.
[01:47:53.556 --> 01:47:56.457]  And in Australia, they're telling him a new law, four minute showers.
[01:47:56.477 --> 01:47:58.618]  I mean, it's just all about, we control the resources.
[01:47:59.298 --> 01:48:04.001]  Except, you know, and there again, what's fascinating about that is, and again, purely control.
[01:48:04.101 --> 01:48:05.081]  It's just the idea of control.
[01:48:05.562 --> 01:48:07.483]  When you look at the changing technologies,
[01:48:08.636 --> 01:48:13.439]  When you have all the conservation and recycling systems in place, why would you have to take a four-minute shower?
[01:48:14.079 --> 01:48:17.541]  The system, for instance, understanding organic... Well, they're not doing any of the real good environmental stuff.
[01:48:17.641 --> 01:48:18.042]  Oh, no, no.
[01:48:18.082 --> 01:48:23.065]  It's purely designed to get you into the nutcase scenario of being a plebe, you know, being a slave, being a peon.
[01:48:23.665 --> 01:48:29.448]  Otherwise, think about it, with closed system technologies, I got into this years ago, back in the seventies... Well, I told you this was going to be a rationing car.
[01:48:29.488 --> 01:48:30.729]  Everything you buy is on that.
[01:48:31.009 --> 01:48:31.930]  It also surveils you.
[01:48:32.170 --> 01:48:33.950]  Well, that goes right back to the Soviets.
[01:48:34.590 --> 01:48:37.451]  Remember, people used to stand in line for toilet paper every day.
[01:48:37.651 --> 01:48:40.132]  People used to stand in line for toothbrushes every day.
[01:48:40.172 --> 01:48:41.612]  Making you dependent on the state.
[01:48:41.812 --> 01:48:44.392]  And again, for everybody to say, well, if they just gave it a chance.
[01:48:44.492 --> 01:48:45.113]  It had a chance.
[01:48:45.193 --> 01:48:46.353]  It killed 100 million people.
[01:48:46.433 --> 01:48:47.793]  It lasted 70 plus years.
[01:48:47.873 --> 01:48:50.474]  It fogged off into history only so it could be changed.
[01:48:50.494 --> 01:48:57.075]  The amoeba could shift over and drop itself right in the middle of the United States and the unfortunates in England.
[01:48:57.655 --> 01:49:03.320]  And the fun and the comical part about it is, I'm sorry guys, but I would guess that George Orwell was right!
[01:49:04.381 --> 01:49:05.682]  1984 guys, come on!
[01:49:05.702 --> 01:49:07.163]  Well, this is directly out of that.
[01:49:07.363 --> 01:49:09.245]  It's a playbook when you read the website.
[01:49:09.345 --> 01:49:13.849]  Except that an interesting thing, years ago, my father had to take some additional college classes.
[01:49:13.909 --> 01:49:17.212]  He worked as an apparatus supervisor in designing equipment for
[01:49:18.315 --> 01:49:19.076]  I think?
[01:49:35.535 --> 01:49:36.836]  And both of them said the same thing.
[01:49:36.876 --> 01:49:47.520]  They said, chances are, within a very short period of time here, we're going to have a war waged against us, and we're going to have to fight, and we're going to have to kill the ecologists, the eco-freaks.
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:51.222]  Because what's going to happen is, they're going to deem, and he said, watch how this works.
[01:49:51.302 --> 01:49:53.363]  They understand it's about getting control of resources.
[01:49:54.383 --> 01:49:55.204]  And killing people.
[01:49:55.224 --> 01:49:57.005]  The bottom line is, what's the agenda you keep hearing?
[01:49:57.045 --> 01:49:57.725]  We've got to kill off 80%.
[01:49:58.065 --> 01:50:00.846]  Well, you know what I say, as I've said before, them first.
[01:50:01.307 --> 01:50:03.408]  You go jump off the cliff like the lemming and let me watch.
[01:50:03.568 --> 01:50:04.728]  Oh, that doesn't look good, Alex.
[01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.829]  I don't think we'll do that.
[01:50:05.869 --> 01:50:09.551]  We'll stay here and let the next lemming... Oh, hey, those ecologists don't bounce very well.
[01:50:11.365 --> 01:50:14.187]  But again, it's about co-opting real environmental and conservation.
[01:50:14.227 --> 01:50:14.687]  That's right.
[01:50:14.807 --> 01:50:17.549]  In other words, we have good projects and policies we can implement.
[01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:19.009]  They're just not being implemented.
[01:50:19.069 --> 01:50:23.472]  Or if they are, the idea is to still keep you on a narrow track that puts you in a time lock 20 years old.
[01:50:23.712 --> 01:50:31.356]  Okay, we're going to be right back in Overdrive, one place to listen, on the streams at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:31.456 --> 01:50:35.999]  In fact, we're just going to continue rolling right now for everybody at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:39.421]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:50:41.347 --> 01:50:43.208]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:59.949 --> 01:51:02.912]  Let me give you the toll-free number to call in.
[01:51:02.952 --> 01:51:08.137]  We'll take some calls for 20 minutes, and that's it because Mark's got to go and I've got things piled to the rafters.
[01:51:08.998 --> 01:51:11.060]  The toll-free number to join us is 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, or 512-646-5400, 512-646-5400, or 888-201-2244.
[01:51:24.369 --> 01:51:29.192]  And I guess we've got to go ahead and activate the phone system to be able to do that, so call in about 60 seconds.
[01:51:29.272 --> 01:51:33.294]  Mark, continue with whatever you think is important while we have you here in studio.
[01:51:33.754 --> 01:51:35.856]  Well, again, you hit on the right direction.
[01:51:35.876 --> 01:51:43.240]  You're seeing this in publications just like this brief from England, that it's a totally different age.
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:44.841]  In the past, they could have waited.
[01:51:44.921 --> 01:51:46.922]  We wouldn't have known for two or three months, maybe a year.
[01:51:47.631 --> 01:51:59.920]  Before we found out that, hey, somewhere in an English paper, the London Times or whatever, somebody finally looked on page C14 and lo and behold, here's the exact same thing that was being talked about on the exact same day somewhere in the United States.
[01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:08.486]  The advantage that we have right now is that the information base and the data systems involved are just as much in our command as it is with the enemy.
[01:52:08.526 --> 01:52:13.790]  In fact, more so because their assumption, and for whatever reason, remember, we got the thinkers, they got the stinkers,
[01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:17.572]  We're in a situation where we're able to cross-collate and reference.
[01:52:17.692 --> 01:52:22.476]  The other side seems to assume, and because of the people they chose, they're in a very narrow band.
[01:52:22.796 --> 01:52:25.838]  These people are not the swiftest, you know, they're not the sharpest knives in the drawer.
[01:52:25.858 --> 01:52:26.979]  Yeah, they're all specialized.
[01:52:27.659 --> 01:52:29.400]  They're all specialized in departmentalization.
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:34.023]  The very thing that they're trying to foist upon everybody else is actually becoming their demise.
[01:52:34.043 --> 01:52:36.425]  And the people carrying this out at this level, they think it's good.
[01:52:36.725 --> 01:52:40.808]  Well, again, that's a matter of what Google... I mean the low-level media.
[01:52:40.828 --> 01:52:41.708]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:52:41.728 --> 01:52:43.490]  When you create a police state,
[01:52:44.230 --> 01:52:52.274]  Just like big government, specific criminal minds will gravitate to those positions or control freaks.
[01:52:52.354 --> 01:52:55.295]  And what happens is they may give them another... there's two elements.
[01:52:55.395 --> 01:53:01.698]  One are the zealots who don't care about who they hurt, what's going to happen, because they're into the groove with that.
[01:53:01.818 --> 01:53:03.059]  On the other side you have
[01:53:03.699 --> 01:53:13.163]  Those who literally just would like to hurt people or are into the power factor and they're the ones from the other direction that know they can manipulate the first group and utilize them completely.
[01:53:13.243 --> 01:53:15.463]  So they're the minority in both cases.
[01:53:15.564 --> 01:53:16.984]  This is the comical part about this.
[01:53:17.464 --> 01:53:19.025]  They are not the majority.
[01:53:19.725 --> 01:53:21.467]  They could be neutralized very quickly.
[01:53:21.507 --> 01:53:25.571]  If moose season were to open up tomorrow, there aren't enough moose to go around.
[01:53:26.112 --> 01:53:29.636]  That's why Canada has a moose restricted system, by the way, for hunting.
[01:53:30.176 --> 01:53:31.457]  So, that's what we're seeing here.
[01:53:32.098 --> 01:53:34.100]  Everybody goes, well, they've got spiffy uniforms!
[01:53:34.441 --> 01:53:35.502]  They've got really cool boots!
[01:53:35.762 --> 01:53:36.603]  Oh, and it's black!
[01:53:36.783 --> 01:53:38.364]  Oh my goodness, yeah, it'll look good on my wall.
[01:53:38.524 --> 01:53:40.645]  Right next to the stuff my dad brought back from World War II.
[01:53:40.685 --> 01:53:42.306]  Japanese uniforms, Japanese swords.
[01:53:42.326 --> 01:53:43.047]  You know, it's really cool.
[01:53:43.487 --> 01:53:44.948]  Black uniform, MP5, HK91.
[01:53:44.968 --> 01:53:46.809]  Hey, they're gonna look great.
[01:53:46.889 --> 01:53:47.610]  They're mine now, by the way.
[01:53:47.630 --> 01:53:52.333]  Well, Mark, I want to say, I mean, you and I are both trying to have a peaceful solution to this and not have World War III.
[01:53:52.793 --> 01:53:55.575]  The point is, is that the public has been trained
[01:53:56.195 --> 01:53:59.098]  And I've gotten a chance to meet people in business, high-level Hollywood people.
[01:53:59.138 --> 01:54:00.460]  They're just regular folks, too.
[01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:02.122]  A lot of them are awake, too.
[01:54:03.243 --> 01:54:07.308]  People think that I walk on water, or you walk on water, or we're somehow magical, too.
[01:54:07.908 --> 01:54:09.470]  Well, the same goes for people in government.
[01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:13.555]  They think that these elitists are perfect or invincible or magic or different.
[01:54:13.615 --> 01:54:14.876]  No, they're human beings, too.
[01:54:14.936 --> 01:54:16.057]  They're just like everybody else.
[01:54:16.798 --> 01:54:23.345]  I mean, I kind of somewhat thought this myself, that people who were in Hollywood floated on clouds, or that elites were smarter than I was.
[01:54:23.485 --> 01:54:29.832]  Only now, as I, you know, got more prominent and got involved and learned more, I realized, no, that a lot of the people aren't even as smart as I am, and I don't think I'm that smart.
[01:54:30.172 --> 01:54:31.033]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:54:31.093 --> 01:54:33.976]  People need to get past this inferiority complex.
[01:54:34.036 --> 01:54:34.276]  That's right.
[01:54:34.316 --> 01:54:35.396]  It's not futile to resist.
[01:54:35.476 --> 01:54:36.217]  It is not futile.
[01:54:36.257 --> 01:54:37.217]  You will not be absorbed.
[01:54:37.237 --> 01:54:37.897]  Just the reverse.
[01:54:37.937 --> 01:54:44.059]  The biggest problem they've got is... Our movement, so many people have it in their minds that we're beautiful losers and that we can't win.
[01:54:44.319 --> 01:54:47.200]  And they freak out when we start winning thinking it's some type of sellout.
[01:54:47.581 --> 01:54:47.821]  No, no.
[01:54:47.861 --> 01:54:48.621]  We're prominent.
[01:54:48.661 --> 01:54:49.961]  We're going to wake the people up.
[01:54:50.021 --> 01:54:51.742]  We're going to take the culture over.
[01:54:51.842 --> 01:54:52.282]  That's right.
[01:54:52.362 --> 01:54:55.003]  And one of the things to remember is the other side is not going to.
[01:54:55.063 --> 01:54:57.364]  This is what... Well, let's put it this way.
[01:54:57.384 --> 01:54:58.084]  We talked about this before.
[01:54:58.104 --> 01:55:00.465]  Have you ever heard your enemy apologize for anything that they say?
[01:55:01.095 --> 01:55:01.255]  No.
[01:55:01.815 --> 01:55:05.577]  Yet we're supposed to bend over backwards and apologize for every aspect of our life.
[01:55:05.597 --> 01:55:07.618]  We're supposed to compromise and give in.
[01:55:07.638 --> 01:55:08.278]  You know what?
[01:55:08.378 --> 01:55:09.538]  Like I said, them first.
[01:55:10.239 --> 01:55:11.919]  Everybody has to have that them first.
[01:55:11.939 --> 01:55:12.319]  You know what?
[01:55:12.459 --> 01:55:14.800]  I've got a number ten and a half size military boot here.
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:18.702]  I'm going to stick it between the slats of whoever it is that's stupid enough to try and push us around.
[01:55:19.042 --> 01:55:24.164]  I'm going to run his hind end back on down the road, give him a backpack full of rocks, and let him swim halfway back to the spiders.
[01:55:24.824 --> 01:55:28.026]  And that's not that I don't need a peaceful solution, but my problem is this.
[01:55:28.546 --> 01:55:30.127]  Do you talk to a backed-up toilet?
[01:55:30.227 --> 01:55:31.888]  Do you negotiate with a backed-up toilet?
[01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:33.409]  Have you ever done that?
[01:55:33.449 --> 01:55:34.750]  Is anybody out there listening ever done that?
[01:55:34.770 --> 01:55:35.910]  Do you know how stupid that sounds?
[01:55:36.371 --> 01:55:38.572]  At a given point, you're going to have to go in and get dirty.
[01:55:39.192 --> 01:55:41.854]  In order to make that toilet work again, you're going to have to go in.
[01:55:42.014 --> 01:55:46.657]  Somebody is going to have to go in and clean things up so that the toilet works again.
[01:55:47.397 --> 01:55:54.041]  Now, you can either turn your nose to it and start using a five-gallon bucket out behind the house and figure, well, we'll just shut the door on that bathroom.
[01:55:54.742 --> 01:56:00.469]  Or you can enjoy indoor plumbing and civilization by cleaning up the mess.
[01:56:02.452 --> 01:56:05.135]  And that means you don't negotiate with a backed up toilet.
[01:56:05.536 --> 01:56:08.500]  That means that basically you get the plunger and you stomp its hind end.
[01:56:09.093 --> 01:56:10.314]  No, no, I agree with you.
[01:56:10.354 --> 01:56:14.058]  My whole point is a lot of people in the mid-90s and late 90s wanted to go to war.
[01:56:14.519 --> 01:56:15.620]  It is still a solution.
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:16.261]  It is.
[01:56:16.281 --> 01:56:23.889]  We have a conflict, but my point is we have exposed them, we have politically damaged them, and I thank God it hasn't turned into a shooting war.
[01:56:24.069 --> 01:56:30.996]  Well, in a way, to a degree, the problem with that is we have been successful and we must acknowledge our successes, but we probably would have been better off in a war in 1995.
[01:56:32.614 --> 01:56:35.436]  Because with each step we're going to have a deeper conflict.
[01:56:35.476 --> 01:56:36.597]  I've argued this for years.
[01:56:37.338 --> 01:56:40.841]  If you wait, both sides, in fact our side, we're not going anywhere.
[01:56:40.881 --> 01:56:41.801]  We're right here where we've been.
[01:56:41.842 --> 01:56:42.442]  We live here.
[01:56:42.942 --> 01:56:48.207]  But your enemy has brought more and more resource to bear, so it will cost you more to win.
[01:56:48.487 --> 01:56:51.009]  But our numbers have swung.
[01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:52.990]  I think we have more resources now than they did.
[01:56:53.131 --> 01:56:58.215]  Exactly, but that's where we get down to the whole argument for years of what's called a battlefield on gimbals.
[01:56:58.955 --> 01:57:02.778]  In other words, both sides are moving towards each other.
[01:57:03.378 --> 01:57:11.963]  The battlefield changes depending upon the amount of weight that moves the pivoting gimballed wall, but at a given point, somebody is going to make contact and come head-to-head.
[01:57:12.024 --> 01:57:13.585]  It's not an if, it is just a when.
[01:57:13.605 --> 01:57:18.428]  Well, it took more than 15 years for it to start in our Revolutionary War.
[01:57:18.448 --> 01:57:18.848]  That's right.
[01:57:19.008 --> 01:57:22.130]  And again, here, if you look at what we're seeing right now, let me point this out.
[01:57:23.756 --> 01:57:33.802]  Well, of course, in England, my personal attitude with them is that unless they turn around and basically ban it, whoever's there right now pushing this program, how are you going to get rid of a bunch of sycophants that are raised as nutcases from youth?
[01:57:34.043 --> 01:57:35.704]  A bunch of little spies on power trips.
[01:57:35.864 --> 01:57:38.386]  In fact, what this is, is these are the interior police.
[01:57:39.506 --> 01:57:41.728]  What I've argued for years, and I will do it again... In KVD.
[01:57:42.028 --> 01:57:42.268]  Yes.
[01:57:42.689 --> 01:57:46.771]  In Russia, you don't see Hollywood doing any movies about communist Russia.
[01:57:46.831 --> 01:57:48.773]  You can talk about Germany until you're blue in the face,
[01:57:49.413 --> 01:57:58.662]  Before World War II, during World War II, and after World War II, Joseph Stalin killed approximately 100 million people between Georgia, the Ukraine, the Stans, and God knows how many other places.
[01:57:58.702 --> 01:58:00.024]  We can go right on down the shopping list.
[01:58:00.504 --> 01:58:05.469]  Hollywood won't make movies about that, because Hollywood liked that.
[01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:10.274]  And because Hollywood was part of that.
[01:58:11.357 --> 01:58:12.037]  No illusion.
[01:58:12.597 --> 01:58:13.518]  You can talk about Germany.
[01:58:13.578 --> 01:58:16.779]  Germany in 1945, while Hitler was dust in Berlin.
[01:58:17.359 --> 01:58:33.904]  Ten years later, Joseph Stalin was still butchering people with reckless abandon, and Holly Weird... And now it's come out, what we always told people, the CIA section chief, I'll never forget about it, seven, eight years ago, on History Channel, and it's now been declassified, and David Rockefeller's written about it in the New York Times and in his books.
[01:58:34.464 --> 01:58:39.466]  They put Mao in, and he killed, their government says 60 million in official Chinese records,
[01:58:40.086 --> 01:58:41.026]  And we know it's more like 85.
[01:58:41.646 --> 01:58:47.228]  Even the Cultural Revolution in the first year killed 15.5 million acknowledged through intelligence sources in the day.
[01:58:47.908 --> 01:58:50.028]  And this was the starvation of China.
[01:58:50.048 --> 01:58:53.729]  And I've had former White House historians and analysts on, like Richard C. Cook.
[01:58:53.909 --> 01:58:55.649]  I have had Ray McGovern on, former CIA.
[01:58:55.729 --> 01:58:57.030]  I've had all these analysts on.
[01:58:57.090 --> 01:59:01.211]  They say the government is gearing up for a mass culling in the U.S.
[01:59:01.371 --> 01:59:02.931]  They want to fully do that.
[01:59:03.051 --> 01:59:04.391]  Now let me ask you something, guys.
[01:59:04.751 --> 01:59:05.632]  What does that mean?
[01:59:05.752 --> 01:59:07.212]  Because you see, when you give these numbers,
[01:59:08.089 --> 01:59:09.650]  I'll give you an example of how that works.
[01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:11.751]  How many people live in Austin, Texas?
[01:59:12.572 --> 01:59:13.793]  Metro, about a million.
[01:59:13.853 --> 01:59:14.493]  In the city, about 800,000.
[01:59:14.993 --> 01:59:15.574]  Okay.
[01:59:15.894 --> 01:59:18.616]  So we're looking at 1.5 million to 1.8 million.
[01:59:18.636 --> 01:59:19.356]  We'll use a number here.
[01:59:19.376 --> 01:59:19.516]  No, no.
[01:59:19.536 --> 01:59:21.617]  In total, it's only about a million.
[01:59:21.818 --> 01:59:23.158]  I'm going to say, with the urban.
[01:59:23.819 --> 01:59:28.762]  We're talking about within a reasonable walking distance, there's about 1.5 million people, plus or minus.
[01:59:28.882 --> 01:59:30.523]  It's a little more, but we're going to use that number.
[01:59:31.485 --> 01:59:35.306]  We just gave a number of 15 million people killed in one year.
[01:59:35.386 --> 01:59:36.766]  In one year, that's 10 Austins.
[01:59:37.226 --> 01:59:39.087]  Yeah, now here's a way for people to understand that.
[01:59:39.107 --> 01:59:50.189]  I want you to go to the west side of this city, and I want you to imagine walking from one side of this city to the next, and everywhere you go where a person was standing, they are now laying dead.
[01:59:51.590 --> 02:00:00.852]  Every man, every woman, every child, the cats, the dogs, they'd kill everything and anything if they felt it would empower them in some way.
[02:00:01.638 --> 02:00:11.601]  Now you're not talking one time Austin, you're talking in Michigan for instance, walking from the upper peninsula to the bottom of the state with nothing but death before you.
[02:00:12.421 --> 02:00:18.703]  Now I better, you better all ask this real quick of every American out there, is what do you want of this country?
[02:00:19.583 --> 02:00:22.924]  And here's the thing, do you think you're going to ride this storm out and duck this?
[02:00:24.181 --> 02:00:27.144]  The agenda that's being presented... By the way, a lot of you are serving it.
[02:00:27.445 --> 02:00:29.347]  Mainline conservatives giggling and laughing.
[02:00:29.707 --> 02:00:35.374]  I saw an ad on Drudge, a t-shirt saying, I love waterboarding, I'd rather be waterboarding.
[02:00:35.894 --> 02:00:37.837]  If they can do that to somebody else, that's a set of precedent.
[02:00:37.857 --> 02:00:39.539]  They want to do that to you, you little fools.
[02:00:39.879 --> 02:00:44.204]  You own some property, you own some land, you've licked their boots well, you're going to be the first going in the ground.
[02:00:44.284 --> 02:00:47.065]  Yes, in fact you're the first on the menu because you're the easiest one to grab.
[02:00:47.145 --> 02:00:50.286]  That's one of the things that happened with the Cultural Revolution in China.
[02:00:50.306 --> 02:00:51.046]  First on the menu.
[02:00:51.246 --> 02:00:52.287]  It happened in Russia.
[02:00:52.347 --> 02:00:53.207]  That's right, it happened.
[02:00:53.227 --> 02:00:54.287]  What about in Cambodia?
[02:00:54.327 --> 02:01:00.690]  Here's a situation where you have a lot of... Anybody who had glasses or had fillings was deemed to be middle class, you were killed.
[02:01:00.710 --> 02:01:01.070]  That's right.
[02:01:01.210 --> 02:01:03.491]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski engineered that and brags about it.
[02:01:03.571 --> 02:01:12.854]  And in fact the very voice you hear here with Henry Kissinger, that is one of the demons who absolutely helped to engineer it because he empowered Zbigniew Brzezinski and many others.
[02:01:12.914 --> 02:01:13.554]  That's his protégé.
[02:01:13.974 --> 02:01:14.796]  And conduit.
[02:01:14.856 --> 02:01:18.262]  He created the conduit of resources that allowed them to be able to do it.
[02:01:18.322 --> 02:01:20.346]  Now, they're not working in a vacuum.
[02:01:20.586 --> 02:01:21.628]  And here's the problem people.
[02:01:21.668 --> 02:01:23.091]  We're not talking over there.
[02:01:23.959 --> 02:01:32.363]  We're talking inside the United States on a scale that most people, that's what bends their mind, is the idea that they have to look at this realistically.
[02:01:32.863 --> 02:01:33.584]  The numbers.
[02:01:34.384 --> 02:01:42.548]  If we go by the litmus test of history, the scale of history, we have demonstrations over and over again of what socialism does.
[02:01:42.908 --> 02:01:51.453]  And if you look at Chinese model versus Russian model versus Ukraine, other places, we're talking, they're probably planning on killing
[02:01:52.708 --> 02:01:56.170]  In the entire multi-phase program, what, 60, 70 million?
[02:01:56.410 --> 02:01:57.410]  If they were to have their way.
[02:01:57.510 --> 02:02:00.212]  But the difference is, unlike Russia, and unlike the... We have guns.
[02:02:00.352 --> 02:02:01.973]  Yeah, we have, we are very well armed.
[02:02:02.133 --> 02:02:05.274]  And if 1% of 100 million gun owners decides to fight, that's 1 million people.
[02:02:05.394 --> 02:02:08.296]  I'd be happy if just, here's the problem, and they don't want anybody to think about this.
[02:02:08.656 --> 02:02:10.597]  Everybody listening has one firearm.
[02:02:11.519 --> 02:02:15.682]  Everybody listening walks out and takes their moose and just walks away from the war.
[02:02:16.282 --> 02:02:20.786]  There are not enough moose to go around.
[02:02:21.346 --> 02:02:27.810]  The black uniformed or blue beret moose are simply not in sufficient numbers.
[02:02:28.271 --> 02:02:30.172]  You don't have to even fight the whole war.
[02:02:30.652 --> 02:02:33.695]  If you went out and just plugged one and let it sit there and twitch...
[02:02:34.615 --> 02:02:37.798]  And strip it for whatever's there, what would they do?
[02:02:38.338 --> 02:02:46.925]  See, what Alexander Solzhenitsyn said, Oh, how we burned in the camps, knowing full well that we had had nothing to lose.
[02:02:47.545 --> 02:02:58.353]  And if we had waited when the mass arrests began, with cudgels and sharp objects, the wretched machine for lack of operatives would have ground to a halt.
[02:03:00.569 --> 02:03:03.051]  So here again, people, what have you got to lose?
[02:03:03.171 --> 02:03:03.472]  Nothing.
[02:03:03.512 --> 02:03:04.312]  What have you got to gain?
[02:03:04.553 --> 02:03:05.514]  Absolutely everything.
[02:03:05.554 --> 02:03:06.014]  You know what?
[02:03:06.534 --> 02:03:07.515]  The only thing I'll say is this.
[02:03:07.535 --> 02:03:15.042]  There's this war, and it is going to be a war, and it would be nice to say that it would be peaceful, but it's not going to be because you're dealing with an animal that is a vicious leg-biter.
[02:03:15.623 --> 02:03:18.065]  You ever tried to argue with a dog that's a biter?
[02:03:18.874 --> 02:03:20.636]  There isn't a whole lot of arguing you can do.
[02:03:20.736 --> 02:03:25.561]  You either, A, shoot it, or have a really good 2x4 and smack it side the head and keep her down.
[02:03:26.202 --> 02:03:28.144]  Of course, you can cage it, which would be really good.
[02:03:28.164 --> 02:03:30.066]  It's first containment is a nice idea.
[02:03:30.166 --> 02:03:32.949]  Usually the owner does that, by the way, if he's smart.
[02:03:33.550 --> 02:03:35.912]  But in this case, you're the owner of these dogs.
[02:03:36.052 --> 02:03:38.115]  They plan on just simply letting them run the town.
[02:03:39.002 --> 02:03:40.263]  Well, that's already happening.
[02:03:40.363 --> 02:03:45.685]  Every day, the cops just run up to a guy on a bicycle, no reason, and slam his head in the concrete and then charge him.
[02:03:46.065 --> 02:03:47.626]  And it's on video, and they say, we don't care.
[02:03:48.006 --> 02:03:51.748]  Or throwing a guy off a bridge and tasering him 19 times and laughing.
[02:03:52.208 --> 02:03:56.750]  My whole issue is, you see a lot of police, a lot of people in your family.
[02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:57.730]  Call them peace officers.
[02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:58.191]  That's the difference.
[02:03:58.211 --> 02:03:59.151]  Exactly, peace officers.
[02:03:59.751 --> 02:04:01.052]  They are good.
[02:04:01.092 --> 02:04:01.852]  They're on our side.
[02:04:01.872 --> 02:04:05.774]  They're not doing all of this, so it's certainly not time for going out after moose.
[02:04:05.914 --> 02:04:08.555]  It's a minority issue, first of all, but here's the problem.
[02:04:08.575 --> 02:04:12.437]  There's going to be a given point when you're going to reach the limit, period.
[02:04:12.457 --> 02:04:13.738]  There's just simply that's all there is to it.
[02:04:13.838 --> 02:04:17.199]  And those men, I've had men walk right up to me and say, Hi Mark, you don't know who I am.
[02:04:17.319 --> 02:04:18.380]  I'm deputy so and so.
[02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:28.164]  I just want you to look at my face and remember who I am because if I'm in uniform when this starts, the first thing that's disappearing is the uniform and I'm going to be with my family and we're already armed and we're with you.
[02:04:28.911 --> 02:04:37.782]  And the reason they say that is because their perception is that they would like everybody to understand they're not part of this, and they won't participate.
[02:04:37.822 --> 02:04:39.784]  And I can say this, but I cannot mention names.
[02:04:39.964 --> 02:04:41.947]  I have watched this happen in the last year.
[02:04:42.968 --> 02:04:45.391]  They've already tried to orchestrate something else.
[02:04:45.791 --> 02:04:46.152]  With you?
[02:04:46.572 --> 02:04:47.733]  It already failed.
[02:04:48.567 --> 02:04:51.709]  Yeah, you just spent seven years on video for doing nothing.
[02:04:51.729 --> 02:04:52.770]  They ran you off the road.
[02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:53.211]  Exactly.
[02:04:53.231 --> 02:04:57.314]  Just like they run 15 feet over the side of the street and knock a guy off a bicycle and then charge him.
[02:04:57.554 --> 02:04:57.734]  Right.
[02:04:57.894 --> 02:04:58.214]  Exactly.
[02:04:58.234 --> 02:05:00.496]  And the point is that they're pressing the envelope.
[02:05:00.516 --> 02:05:01.197]  But here's the thing.
[02:05:01.277 --> 02:05:08.222]  There are many people, and they will tell you the same thing, that they are expecting to fight because the rabid ones that are chosen for authority
[02:05:09.051 --> 02:05:10.894]  Are not the thinking ones.
[02:05:11.154 --> 02:05:15.720]  You have to get outside this box that you're going to negotiate with a backed-up toilet.
[02:05:15.781 --> 02:05:17.944]  The backed-up toilet, in fact, this one has wheels.
[02:05:18.344 --> 02:05:21.068]  It plans on being rolled down through your neighborhood, okay?
[02:05:22.208 --> 02:05:23.109]  And that's the problem.
[02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:25.010]  Look at him as nothing more than a backed-up toilet.
[02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:25.850]  How do you fix it?
[02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:27.891]  Break out the plunger and get rid of the problem.
[02:05:28.411 --> 02:05:30.733]  Now, we are going to, we do get to choose.
[02:05:31.153 --> 02:05:40.158]  One of the mistakes made here is, I will ask again, I want somebody to go to the National Archives and I want them to show me the vote that took us into the American Revolution.
[02:05:41.018 --> 02:05:42.539]  The American Revolution started on April 19, 1775.
[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:47.241]  I want you to show me the ballot box and I want you to show me the counting of the votes.
[02:05:47.762 --> 02:05:48.182]  Where is it?
[02:05:48.939 --> 02:05:51.222]  No, it started when they started shooting at each other.
[02:05:51.543 --> 02:05:58.813]  It started when one man said, you know what, I've been out here seven times, Paul made his right, he told everybody to get up, we all got up, the British came out, the cowards ran.
[02:05:59.751 --> 02:06:05.532]  They came out, and eventually, remember when the American Revolution started, the British had to sneak out of Boston.
[02:06:06.073 --> 02:06:09.013]  The Patriot movement was watching everything that they were doing.
[02:06:09.093 --> 02:06:12.514]  The counties knew that when they moved, they had to mobilize the militias.
[02:06:13.014 --> 02:06:14.595]  And it was made up of all of the people.
[02:06:14.955 --> 02:06:16.455]  And each time they went out, and they stopped.
[02:06:16.515 --> 02:06:17.035]  And they went back.
[02:06:17.155 --> 02:06:18.295]  And each time they went out, they stopped.
[02:06:18.315 --> 02:06:23.937]  And this is part of history that they have to try and eliminate, because, wait a minute, they're the most powerful army on the planet.
[02:06:23.957 --> 02:06:24.697]  What were they afraid of?
[02:06:25.461 --> 02:06:28.723]  They were afraid of the people because there weren't enough moose.
[02:06:29.363 --> 02:06:31.065]  Finally, on April 19th, somebody got stupid.
[02:06:31.085 --> 02:06:32.666]  They figured, well, we just got to press the envelope.
[02:06:33.546 --> 02:06:42.552]  One man, probably on our side, probably a 20-year veteran of the French and Indian Wars, said, I'm 62 years old and I ain't getting any younger and I'm not going to do this anymore.
[02:06:42.612 --> 02:06:42.812]  Boom!
[02:06:43.658 --> 02:06:45.499]  And he voted with a one-ounce chunk of lead.
[02:06:46.199 --> 02:06:50.181]  The lead was cast as a, well, residing vote or resounding vote.
[02:06:50.721 --> 02:06:53.022]  It was placed in the red coat ballot box.
[02:06:54.183 --> 02:07:05.228]  And then the red coats cast a whole bunch of ballots, the patriots cast a whole bunch of ballots, and the militia withdrew from the election, so to speak, for a little bit of time and ran across the fields out of Lexington proper.
[02:07:07.449 --> 02:07:20.032]  The British collected themselves went to look for another voting process at Concord and they found out that they were on the losing side and the number of votes cast were in favor of the Patriot effort and the largest military force on the planet backed by a navy.
[02:07:20.072 --> 02:07:31.535]  And that's the problem with this lawless government and all of its crimes is it is pushing everyone into a Law of the Jungle scenario where the cartridge box is now the ballot box.
[02:07:31.555 --> 02:07:32.895]  They're hoping for reaction.
[02:07:33.876 --> 02:07:35.016]  Notice that I'm not shouting
[02:07:36.252 --> 02:07:37.393]  I'm responding.
[02:07:38.533 --> 02:07:39.774]  I have a plan.
[02:07:40.334 --> 02:07:48.278]  There are millions of soldiers and former soldiers out there that don't want to fight, but they have a plan too.
[02:07:49.144 --> 02:07:51.486]  And we all understand how to wage war.
[02:07:52.146 --> 02:07:53.067]  It is what we did.
[02:07:53.327 --> 02:07:54.127]  I was a trainer.
[02:07:54.147 --> 02:07:55.768]  I was an OPFOR training commander.
[02:07:56.329 --> 02:07:59.230]  I have managed virtually tens of thousands of men.
[02:08:00.131 --> 02:08:03.233]  That job hasn't changed and my experience hasn't changed.
[02:08:03.373 --> 02:08:10.498]  And a lot of other men just like me and men with far more experience with two and three wars under their belt are on our side.
[02:08:11.258 --> 02:08:16.579]  Simply asking the question, how could the American people be so stupid as to let this happen or put up with it?
[02:08:16.619 --> 02:08:19.160]  At a given point, those men are going to cancel the war.
[02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:20.180]  Let me just list some of the things.
[02:08:20.220 --> 02:08:22.181]  We have illegal aliens who are felons.
[02:08:22.641 --> 02:08:24.261]  The mainstream news admits that's the prize.
[02:08:24.322 --> 02:08:25.542]  A felon who is a foreigner.
[02:08:25.842 --> 02:08:27.202]  They're filling the military up with that.
[02:08:27.602 --> 02:08:29.103]  Mercenaries, foreign troops.
[02:08:29.163 --> 02:08:32.024]  I played Bill Moyers yesterday with Israeli troops in the U.S.
[02:08:32.424 --> 02:08:34.424]  I mean, this is now on PBS.
[02:08:35.264 --> 02:08:36.785]  So all of this is going on
[02:08:37.765 --> 02:08:45.711]  My only point is, I don't want to start a hot war when we are in the Info War destroying them right now.
[02:08:45.731 --> 02:08:47.292]  We're going to have to be ready to do both.
[02:08:47.352 --> 02:08:52.116]  We must be prepared as the militia to, if need be, defend any element of the Patriot movement.
[02:08:52.136 --> 02:08:54.838]  So for you, Mark Horny, and we've got to take a few calls here because I've got to go.
[02:08:54.858 --> 02:08:56.259]  What is the line in the sand for you?
[02:09:00.402 --> 02:09:13.849]  I think that if there's a, and again this was planned on for, let's see, we knew as of November of 1994 that in March, from March 21st to March 23rd of 1995 they were planning mass arrests of patriots across the United States.
[02:09:14.577 --> 02:09:16.498]  So you got on air and said they were planning to stage a terror attack?
[02:09:16.518 --> 02:09:19.299]  We told everybody about it and said, this is before Oklahoma City.
[02:09:19.339 --> 02:09:23.381]  Remember, that would have been the premise for the government doing the bombing and saying the Patriots did it.
[02:09:23.441 --> 02:09:25.562]  Now the problem is that Oklahoma City happened in a vacuum.
[02:09:26.142 --> 02:09:28.163]  Because we flat out said, here's how it's going to work.
[02:09:28.903 --> 02:09:32.445]  If anybody is picked up, if you try to grab a whole bunch of people, you will die.
[02:09:33.812 --> 02:09:35.893]  I looked right at one person and said, what do you think is going to happen?
[02:09:35.933 --> 02:09:41.737]  I said, the only thing you need to bring is a whole hell of a lot of body bags because ain't nobody going to put up with it and you're going to end up with a whole lot of dead people.
[02:09:42.377 --> 02:09:46.500]  So you're the ones that are going to be at fault for starting this thing, not us, because nobody's going to put up with this anymore.
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:47.961]  And that did not happen in a vacuum.
[02:09:48.501 --> 02:09:56.827]  That started in 1988 with the ATF and a series of abuses that went on for five years before Ruby Ridge, where they killed women, they killed men, they attacked people.
[02:09:56.927 --> 02:09:57.647]  Ruby Ridge didn't happen.
[02:09:57.667 --> 02:09:58.908]  Setting precedents, trial balloons.
[02:09:59.028 --> 02:10:05.612]  Progressively moving forward so that by the time they're done, in the year 1993, everybody saw Waco on national television.
[02:10:06.273 --> 02:10:13.117]  And Waco was a progressive, cascading, it was the culmination of five to six years of ongoing abuses.
[02:10:13.877 --> 02:10:18.340]  Now their logic was, I'll keep pressing, I'll keep pressing, after all, you'll have to acquiesce, you'll have to acquiesce.
[02:10:19.061 --> 02:10:21.042]  And they were looking to show them.
[02:10:21.102 --> 02:10:22.683]  I think they were looking to start a fight.
[02:10:22.843 --> 02:10:27.046]  No, they were looking to show you that they could kick rumpus and take names.
[02:10:27.646 --> 02:10:32.408]  And the logic there was to also puff up the infantry that are doing the job because secret... Give them a few victories shooting up churches.
[02:10:32.448 --> 02:10:35.109]  Secret police have to... I mean, they have no... They gotta have blood.
[02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.949]  They have no spine.
[02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.749]  They're cowards.
[02:10:36.969 --> 02:10:37.330]  Okay?
[02:10:37.610 --> 02:10:38.430]  Just like you see here.
[02:10:39.150 --> 02:10:43.052]  Popping a guy on a bike with three guys with a car or two guys with a car is nothing to me.
[02:10:43.692 --> 02:10:45.773]  That shows me that you're dealing with a pea brain and a thug.
[02:10:46.233 --> 02:10:46.493]  Okay?
[02:10:47.550 --> 02:10:52.317]  When you attack a church with grandmas, grandpas, women and children and all the working men away, that's what savages do.
[02:10:52.358 --> 02:10:55.602]  They wait until the men were in the field and then they attack the fortress or they attack the town.
[02:10:55.642 --> 02:11:00.590]  The Indians would always attack when the men were in the fields or working because they'd be away from the treasure.
[02:11:01.613 --> 02:11:04.654]  That's exactly what the savages did at Waco the exact same way.
[02:11:05.014 --> 02:11:14.958]  And everybody saw it on national television and it still failed because what it did is it demonstrated what we tried to explain to everybody behind the scenes long before I did American Peril.
[02:11:15.098 --> 02:11:16.218]  Now the same thing is true now.
[02:11:16.298 --> 02:11:17.539]  It's going to be the same scenario.
[02:11:18.119 --> 02:11:19.439]  At some point they're going to be stupid.
[02:11:19.959 --> 02:11:24.741]  Now if they're smart, they're going to back off and they're going to sit down and maybe do the right thing.
[02:11:25.281 --> 02:11:29.863]  What's going to change that is all these people that are listening saying, I saw what you did and I know who you are.
[02:11:30.566 --> 02:11:31.847]  You're not doing it in a vacuum.
[02:11:31.867 --> 02:11:33.227]  You're not doing it in isolation.
[02:11:33.747 --> 02:11:34.728]  Millions of people know.
[02:11:34.788 --> 02:11:36.008]  Tens of millions of people know.
[02:11:36.048 --> 02:11:36.529]  Here's the thing.
[02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:37.409]  What do you have in your hand?
[02:11:37.469 --> 02:11:38.409]  It's from England!
[02:11:39.450 --> 02:11:40.730]  Not just Americans know.
[02:11:41.391 --> 02:11:42.971]  All of the thinking world knows.
[02:11:43.932 --> 02:11:45.753]  The enemy is in trouble because of that.
[02:11:45.833 --> 02:11:56.257]  Because there's not, first not a lot of this... Now all of this puffing and blustering and black uniforms and festoon with medals is an attempt to intimidate like a beaten wife back into submission.
[02:11:56.317 --> 02:11:59.279]  One of the things I have is a pair of scissors I carry in my combat equipment.
[02:11:59.379 --> 02:11:59.899]  You know what it's for?
[02:12:00.914 --> 02:12:06.017]  I'm looking to try and get at least one of every one of the three-letter alphabet suit patches off each uniform of the ones we've shot.
[02:12:06.317 --> 02:12:09.558]  Because it looks really good on the wall next to the rifles and the hats you've taken.
[02:12:09.639 --> 02:12:10.939]  Especially the ones with the bloodstains.
[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:12.920]  You know, war trophies are a fun thing.
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:14.141]  Americans are notorious for that.
[02:12:14.401 --> 02:12:15.522]  Okay?
[02:12:15.962 --> 02:12:17.442]  That's the attitude everybody has to have.
[02:12:17.503 --> 02:12:20.664]  Not this, I'm not, you know what?
[02:12:20.684 --> 02:12:21.064]  Look at that.
[02:12:21.104 --> 02:12:21.645]  See that one there?
[02:12:21.665 --> 02:12:22.485]  You know what, Alex?
[02:12:22.645 --> 02:12:25.627]  I think he's wearing a ten and a half size boot and mine are getting kind of tired.
[02:12:26.487 --> 02:12:27.308]  I'll beat you to them.
[02:12:28.687 --> 02:12:30.088]  Ah, Cornkey, you're something else.
[02:12:30.108 --> 02:12:31.489]  That's the attitude everybody's got to have.
[02:12:31.549 --> 02:12:34.951]  And then again, the other subtle thing, because they're cowards, they are not brave people.
[02:12:34.971 --> 02:12:52.182]  To beat up on Alex by himself on a road in a dark alley, or anybody that we know, that's not an act of a man, one-on-one, that's the act of cowards who, of course, work in packs, when they have to deal with free men and women who stand the line, and in the light of day.
[02:12:52.802 --> 02:12:55.983]  Well, I don't want people to know they have strength and power and the enemy is weak.
[02:12:57.024 --> 02:13:05.087]  And we need to pray for peace, prepare for war, and we need to prepare to protect our families because there's no doubt this government is completely illegitimate and completely criminal.
[02:13:05.247 --> 02:13:06.848]  At least be ready to feed yourself and take care of yourself.
[02:13:06.868 --> 02:13:09.569]  And Mark, I have to say that you have a lot of courage to say the things you say.
[02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:20.414]  I truly have weighed things and I try, my job is to wake up as many as I can, to energize as many people as I can, just as you have done and been successful at.
[02:13:21.114 --> 02:13:25.676]  And to just let people know the nature of their enemy so they can make the decisions about what they're going to do.
[02:13:25.696 --> 02:13:26.796]  And then I can point people at you.
[02:13:27.096 --> 02:13:27.937]  Give folks your website.
[02:13:27.977 --> 02:13:29.577]  I only have time to take two or three phone calls.
[02:13:29.597 --> 02:13:30.318]  Okay, real quick here.
[02:13:30.378 --> 02:13:34.239]  Go to www.LibertyTreeRadio.4mg.com
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:41.703]  That's www.LibertyTreeRadio.4mg.com.
[02:13:42.064 --> 02:13:45.706]  And we're also on We The People Radio Network, by the way, WTPRN.com.
[02:13:46.206 --> 02:13:49.088]  You'll also find us, if you want to go to YouTube, have some fun, guys.
[02:13:49.708 --> 02:13:54.171]  Go to YouTube and punch in Liberty Tree Radio.
[02:13:54.955 --> 02:13:57.297]  That's Liberty Tree Radio.
[02:13:57.317 --> 02:13:59.518]  Go to YouTube, punch in Liberty Tree Radio.
[02:13:59.538 --> 02:14:00.879]  You've got some great training videos.
[02:14:00.959 --> 02:14:02.740]  All the videos, both of our music videos.
[02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:06.403]  Take a look, this will give you a chance to see what troops are doing all around the country, a lot of the training.
[02:14:06.863 --> 02:14:09.545]  And by the way, you will see our new dog, Bruce.
[02:14:09.825 --> 02:14:11.666]  He was 220 pounds when we got him.
[02:14:11.686 --> 02:14:13.287]  He's a black and white dog.
[02:14:13.367 --> 02:14:16.870]  We had to weld two of them together, one white, one black, and we went schnook.
[02:14:17.410 --> 02:14:18.191]  And now we have this.
[02:14:18.291 --> 02:14:19.912]  Ah, no squeezing, only tickle.
[02:14:19.932 --> 02:14:22.013]  Alright, listen, I gotta give him some calls here.
[02:14:22.413 --> 02:14:24.495]  Eric in Philly, you are on the air, go ahead.
[02:14:25.535 --> 02:14:26.275]  Hey, wonderful.
[02:14:26.575 --> 02:14:28.656]  Alex, Mark Corky.
[02:14:30.397 --> 02:14:40.401]  You were incarcerated for seven years, Mark, and I believe the main reason you were able to get through that is because you had the unbelievable support of your wife?
[02:14:40.902 --> 02:14:41.942]  Yes, as a matter of fact.
[02:14:42.082 --> 02:14:45.564]  Both Nancy and many friends that we had out there across the country.
[02:14:45.644 --> 02:14:46.324]  And your sons.
[02:14:46.544 --> 02:14:46.764]  Yes.
[02:14:47.124 --> 02:14:48.885]  And all three of the sons of my daughter, too, by the way.
[02:14:51.506 --> 02:14:57.153]  Yeah, because I was actually charged with aggravated assault because a cop said I hit him with my car.
[02:14:57.954 --> 02:15:00.576]  And I had to do three months, and that was very hard.
[02:15:00.616 --> 02:15:02.679]  But the thing that got me through it was my family.
[02:15:02.919 --> 02:15:04.441]  Yeah, that's one of their favorite deals.
[02:15:04.621 --> 02:15:08.105]  Go right ahead, go right ahead.
[02:15:10.053 --> 02:15:11.034]  It was unbelievable.
[02:15:11.174 --> 02:15:13.456]  I would actually like to send you the info, Mark.
[02:15:13.596 --> 02:15:14.757]  Maybe you could help me out with that.
[02:15:14.777 --> 02:15:17.340]  By the way, you can go to Type Mark Horky on YouTube.
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:21.763]  It's one of the hundreds of videos, if you can find it quick, where you can see the squad car video.
[02:15:21.803 --> 02:15:27.568]  Back before YouTube, we aired it on AXS TV, when they were setting you up, and it was the cops were chasing you, and they run you off the road and charge you.
[02:15:27.608 --> 02:15:28.509]  Plus also the video.
[02:15:28.569 --> 02:15:29.570]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:15:29.590 --> 02:15:34.574]  Also, we have the dispatch tapes that they didn't think we had, because several of the officers were recording their own dispatches.
[02:15:34.654 --> 02:15:35.895]  I'll tell the story now, the rest away.
[02:15:36.776 --> 02:15:41.217]  We had the police officers who did not, who knew this was wrong, did not want to be part of it.
[02:15:41.277 --> 02:15:42.997]  What they did is they had recorded everything.
[02:15:43.137 --> 02:15:46.258]  Well, the sheriff's deputy, the first one following him, he says, why are we following Mark Corky?
[02:15:46.278 --> 02:15:47.478]  Well, we're looking for a bank robber.
[02:15:47.498 --> 02:15:49.559]  What are we following Mark Corky for?
[02:15:49.859 --> 02:15:52.419]  And immediately they said, go to cell phone.
[02:15:52.979 --> 02:15:57.900]  And they were on what is called the command frequency, which is isolated from the dispatch frequency, so command can talk.
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:00.461]  And then people ask, why didn't you stop the car?
[02:16:00.501 --> 02:16:01.581]  You had your son with you.
[02:16:01.721 --> 02:16:02.782]  Well, I had two of my sons with me.
[02:16:02.822 --> 02:16:07.906]  I got them out of the car is what I did because it was obvious at a given point it became very obvious that they were going to try.
[02:16:07.946 --> 02:16:09.648]  In fact, it was said later in the courtroom.
[02:16:09.668 --> 02:16:11.489]  Did you notice that morning you were being followed and things?
[02:16:11.549 --> 02:16:13.051]  You didn't know what they were planning with your sons.
[02:16:13.111 --> 02:16:14.232]  Right, there was something else going on.
[02:16:14.272 --> 02:16:18.795]  The whole thing in a nutshell is the incident itself was orchestrated from beginning to end.
[02:16:18.875 --> 02:16:22.218]  One of the things that came out on the 911 tape is the call from the bank.
[02:16:22.979 --> 02:16:23.479]  Uh, hello, 911.
[02:16:24.180 --> 02:16:25.401]  Yes, we've just been robbed.
[02:16:25.421 --> 02:16:27.523]  Uh, is he right there?
[02:16:28.123 --> 02:16:28.624]  No, he isn't.
[02:16:29.084 --> 02:16:29.625]  Well, where is he?
[02:16:30.425 --> 02:16:35.568]  Well, he just walked out of the front door of the bank, across the street, and over to the Sheriff's Department.
[02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:37.589]  And she goes, what?
[02:16:37.729 --> 02:16:38.470]  Would you repeat that?
[02:16:38.930 --> 02:16:46.334]  Well, we're right here, standing in the bank window, and he went right out the front door, and across the street, and over to the Sheriff's Department.
[02:16:46.934 --> 02:16:48.555]  And it goes dead quiet on the other end.
[02:16:49.296 --> 02:16:58.941]  Now, he then walked across the street, goes to the Dairy Queen, which is only from the distance of here to that store across the street from your office here, and meets with the duty sergeant for the Sheriff's Department.
[02:17:00.014 --> 02:17:01.735]  And then suddenly everybody's after Mark Hornky.
[02:17:01.815 --> 02:17:06.917]  And this is the actual bank robber who absconded with, went into the bank, and took the money.
[02:17:06.937 --> 02:17:08.298]  And this guy, by the way, looks nothing like you.
[02:17:08.418 --> 02:17:09.158]  Nothing like me.
[02:17:09.359 --> 02:17:12.560]  Isn't he tall and gray-haired?
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:13.981]  Lean and very thin.
[02:17:14.081 --> 02:17:14.921]  Lean and very thin.
[02:17:14.941 --> 02:17:16.062]  I mean, lean.
[02:17:16.102 --> 02:17:17.342]  Very thin, very thin face.
[02:17:17.422 --> 02:17:18.463]  In fact, they had him on camera.
[02:17:19.639 --> 02:17:20.980]  They knew because they had the cameras.
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:22.440]  The bank is all camera'd up.
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:27.302]  They had the feeds right there, even as they were... And the sheriff's deputy's on table, and why are we following Mark Horn?
[02:17:27.362 --> 02:17:27.762]  Exactly.
[02:17:28.082 --> 02:17:30.743]  And the other thing about it... But then other cops show up and run you off the road.
[02:17:31.003 --> 02:17:31.203]  Right.
[02:17:31.523 --> 02:17:33.444]  Real quick here, if you'd like to send something to me, PBN...
[02:17:35.805 --> 02:17:36.165]  P.O.
[02:17:36.205 --> 02:17:39.047]  Box 194, Dexter, Michigan, 48130.
[02:17:39.467 --> 02:17:42.429]  That way, if you need to send any packets or anything, P.B.N.
[02:17:42.949 --> 02:17:43.229]  P.O.
[02:17:43.269 --> 02:17:45.110]  Box 194, Dexter, Michigan, 48130.
[02:17:45.210 --> 02:17:46.191]  Sound good?
[02:17:46.911 --> 02:17:48.372]  Yeah, let's go.
[02:17:48.652 --> 02:17:50.013]  Jay in Florida, quickly, go ahead.
[02:17:50.713 --> 02:17:52.254]  Hey Alex, hey Mark, how you guys doing?
[02:17:52.294 --> 02:17:54.155]  I'm doing great, because you're on the air.
[02:17:54.595 --> 02:18:00.699]  Okay, my question is, I'm sure, I know that I'm a Ron Paul supporter, I know Alex is, and Mark, maybe you are too.
[02:18:00.839 --> 02:18:01.119]  Of course.
[02:18:02.130 --> 02:18:08.073]  Since Ron's now out, you know, we have one other alternative, which is the Green Party and Cynthia McKinney.
[02:18:08.293 --> 02:18:10.454]  And she stands for truth and the 9-11 truth.
[02:18:10.495 --> 02:18:14.096]  I was just wondering if you guys could take a brief moment to... I like Cynthia McKinney.
[02:18:14.277 --> 02:18:17.458]  I like Cynthia McKinney, but she's anti-gun, so I'm not going to be voting for her.
[02:18:17.778 --> 02:18:20.240]  I think she's a well-meaning lady, but she's mainline liberal.
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:25.102]  We are going, we have been supporting the Constitution Party and their candidate.
[02:18:25.122 --> 02:18:26.183]  And you've heard him, you've heard him here.
[02:18:27.287 --> 02:18:28.087]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:18:28.127 --> 02:18:28.588]  Let's move on.
[02:18:28.628 --> 02:18:29.028]  Thanks, guys.
[02:18:29.288 --> 02:18:29.708]  Thank you.
[02:18:30.008 --> 02:18:31.389]  Let's talk to Mike in Ohio.
[02:18:31.409 --> 02:18:31.889]  You're on the air.
[02:18:31.909 --> 02:18:32.389]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:18:33.490 --> 02:18:33.910]  Hi, Alex.
[02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.450]  Mark.
[02:18:34.690 --> 02:18:34.950]  Hey.
[02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:54.278]  Mark, I just want to let you know I've got all your old tapes that you put out, and I was saying that, you know, my father told me a long time ago, like back in the 70s, he asked me, you know, do you believe everything the government tells you?
[02:18:54.298 --> 02:18:55.459]  And I just, you know, said,
[02:18:56.625 --> 02:18:57.345]  Oh, 75% bull.
[02:18:57.625 --> 02:19:05.528]  And that's when he told me, he goes, you know, son, that you always going to have to fight for your freedom.
[02:19:05.548 --> 02:19:10.050]  And then that's when he told me that one day you might have to.
[02:19:11.167 --> 02:19:16.291]  So I think you're right that people should be getting ready because they've been at this a long time.
[02:19:16.311 --> 02:19:22.015]  I mean, when they're openly recording the kids to be secret police, I mean, it's just... And they won't be just watching their parents.
[02:19:22.075 --> 02:19:22.835]  See, here's the thing.
[02:19:22.895 --> 02:19:28.559]  Just like they try to depict in that remake, there's a color version, there's black and white, and by the way, there's a BBC version of 1984.
[02:19:28.980 --> 02:19:32.182]  If you get a chance, watch the BBC version.
[02:19:32.202 --> 02:19:32.822]  Yeah, that's the best.
[02:19:32.842 --> 02:19:33.463]  For the kids, the spot.
[02:19:33.703 --> 02:19:35.205]  Yeah, and they're right there.
[02:19:35.305 --> 02:19:35.785]  They're right there.
[02:19:35.805 --> 02:19:36.726]  He's working on the sink.
[02:19:36.886 --> 02:19:37.567]  They're right there.
[02:19:37.587 --> 02:19:39.689]  Whatever they're doing, they're right around the corner.
[02:19:39.729 --> 02:19:41.411]  They're listening from around the corner.
[02:19:41.911 --> 02:19:47.076]  You don't need cameras everywhere if you have organic cameras walking everywhere.
[02:19:48.258 --> 02:19:48.778]  Think about it.
[02:19:48.978 --> 02:19:52.762]  And it's the state taking the children away, and it turns the order of the universe completely on its head.
[02:19:53.002 --> 02:19:53.603]  Got to jump, Mike.
[02:19:53.643 --> 02:19:53.883]  Thanks.
[02:19:53.943 --> 02:19:55.385]  Jeff in Michigan, last transmission.
[02:19:55.785 --> 02:19:56.386]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:19:57.205 --> 02:19:58.686]  Hi, Alex and Mark.
[02:19:58.706 --> 02:20:03.968]  I'm glad that I got through and I want to say thank you, Alex, for your efforts and your enlightenment.
[02:20:04.648 --> 02:20:06.909]  We try to bring you the best people as possible on the show.
[02:20:07.710 --> 02:20:08.250]  Good deal.
[02:20:08.490 --> 02:20:12.872]  And to Mark, I'd like to say that a familiar name I hadn't heard in a while.
[02:20:12.972 --> 02:20:25.158]  I worked for the city in which you did for 18 or 19 years and we followed the things that were happening to you and I consequently had become
[02:20:26.285 --> 02:20:54.069]  A whistleblower for the place in which I worked and took on the government and accused them of fraud and corruption and other things publicly in front of council being on tape and I'm sorry to say they got me because I'm not as tough as you guys are but they rode me out and gave me a medical disability and are now voting to take it away and leave me high and dry so
[02:20:55.063 --> 02:21:00.866]  I just want to applaud you guys who continue to fight despite the... Well, we need you!
[02:21:00.906 --> 02:21:04.087]  We can't let them kill 70, 80 million of us, and I appreciate your call.
[02:21:04.448 --> 02:21:09.670]  We need you, all of you, at least on the InfoWar, copies of films, telling people about the radio show, other radio shows.
[02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:10.771]  This is how it all happens.
[02:21:10.831 --> 02:21:12.051]  Mark Corky, we are out of time.
[02:21:12.752 --> 02:21:15.853]  This was a real pleasure getting to meet you in person after all these years.
[02:21:15.933 --> 02:21:17.214]  Thank you, Alex, appreciate it.
[02:21:17.234 --> 02:21:20.415]  And just go ahead and take us out of here, my friends in there.
[02:21:22.895 --> 02:21:28.280]  Just really appreciate you coming on the show and spending time with us.
[02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:29.461]  And I wish we had more time.
[02:21:29.521 --> 02:21:30.982]  I've got stuff stacked to the rafters.
[02:21:31.022 --> 02:21:33.204]  I appreciate you spending time with us, Mark.
[02:21:33.644 --> 02:21:34.465]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:21:34.505 --> 02:21:38.148]  And by the way, remember your training and you will come back alive!
[02:21:39.589 --> 02:21:42.872]  God, sometimes I think of it.
[02:21:42.892 --> 02:21:44.994]  I'm so focused fighting these people, I don't even think about it much.
[02:21:45.094 --> 02:21:48.417]  I'm trying everything I can to set bushfires in the minds of men.
[02:21:48.917 --> 02:21:49.237]  Excellent.
[02:21:49.318 --> 02:21:50.499]  We're going to continue to do so.
[02:21:50.539 --> 02:21:51.640]  We'll help you in any way we can.
[02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:56.564]  All it takes is an irate, focused minority to bring down tyranny, and we are going to do it.
[02:21:56.944 --> 02:21:58.786]  Mark Hornke, again, great having you here.
[02:21:59.086 --> 02:21:59.686]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:21:59.967 --> 02:22:00.988]  Man, a lot is happening.
[02:22:01.008 --> 02:22:02.289]  The quickening is upon us.
[02:22:02.869 --> 02:22:04.410]  All right, this transmission ends now.
