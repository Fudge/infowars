[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:08.793]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire... Big Brother.
[00:00:09.434 --> 00:00:10.514]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:11.214 --> 00:00:12.335]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:13.796]  You want answers?
[00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:15.436]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:19.779]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:20.299 --> 00:00:24.361]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:39.877]  Well, he's been, um...
[00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:45.728]  Part of, and the star of, top network TV shows since the mid-1990s.
[00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:47.889]  News radio, Fear Factor.
[00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:57.031]  He is the host of Ultimate Fighting Championships, which is now the biggest craze in sports globally, and he's been involved in that for more than a decade.
[00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:02.272]  He's a brown belt in jiu-jitsu, trained by some of the best fighters in the world.
[00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:06.375]  He, of course, hosted the Man Show on Comedy Central.
[00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:14.242]  He's a very successful comedian, you know, traveling the world on huge tours, which millions of people have come out and seen.
[00:01:14.863 --> 00:01:23.411]  And I was lucky enough to get to know Joe and become friends with him, I guess about ten years ago, because he would come to Austin for shows and he was friends with Kevin Booth, the producer for Bill Hicks.
[00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:25.312]  And by the way, it is true.
[00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:26.752]  A Bill Hicks movie is coming out.
[00:01:26.812 --> 00:01:28.073]  I have the inside scoop on that.
[00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:29.694]  Maybe we'll talk about that later.
[00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:31.754]  I don't know how much I can say.
[00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:33.615]  But Russell Crowe is involved.
[00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:34.416]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:35.796]  And that'll be out in the next year and a half.
[00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:36.356]  There, I've said it.
[00:01:36.957 --> 00:01:42.299]  But Joe Rogan is our guest for the next hour and maybe then some, if I can twist his arm to stay with us.
[00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:43.400]  We have
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.004]  Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor of Charles Manson, he's saying Bush is a murderer, needs to be arrested immediately.
[00:01:51.404 --> 00:01:53.186]  Vincent Bugliosi is very respected.
[00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:57.608]  So maybe we'll have Joe ride shotgun if he wants with Mr. Bugliosi, but that's up to Joe.
[00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.310]  We'll talk about it all today.
[00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.692]  9-11, the war, electronic voting frauds, did the moon landing really happen?
[00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:08.435]  We'll also talk about some other subjects that Joe discusses.
[00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:12.258]  He's an amazing individual and he is Joe Rogan.
[00:02:12.518 --> 00:02:13.639]  Joe, thanks for coming on with me.
[00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.040]  Thanks for having me on, buddy.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.661]  What's going on?
[00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:16.602]  Good, man.
[00:02:16.642 --> 00:02:18.984]  I tell you, life just accelerates by.
[00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:23.148]  We used to talk all the time and see a couple times a year out in L.A.
[00:02:23.788 --> 00:02:27.532]  We blinked and a few years went by and I'm glad that you're on the show.
[00:02:29.144 --> 00:02:32.146]  Well, I'm glad I'm on the show, too, and yeah, I've known you for a long time now.
[00:02:32.206 --> 00:02:33.167]  It's kind of crazy.
[00:02:33.227 --> 00:02:35.329]  It's been like eight or nine years at least, right?
[00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:36.870]  Yeah, time just flies, Joe.
[00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.452]  In fact, I got three kids now, and you just had a daughter.
[00:02:40.853 --> 00:02:43.595]  Yeah, I just had a little... well, I didn't have it.
[00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:44.655]  My girlfriend had it.
[00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:47.017]  But yeah, it's crazy, man.
[00:02:47.538 --> 00:02:48.418]  Congratulations.
[00:02:48.678 --> 00:02:49.079]  Thank you.
[00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.021]  Very humbling experience, to say the least.
[00:02:52.776 --> 00:02:57.099]  You know, I think having children, I know it turns on different areas of the brain.
[00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.282]  Did you totally, like, feel other areas switch on?
[00:03:00.782 --> 00:03:01.543]  Oh, yeah.
[00:03:01.683 --> 00:03:06.847]  It's definitely, there's a biological process that goes on, like, almost instantaneously.
[00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:20.177]  You start thinking about, you know, you become much more like of a homebody, you start thinking much more rationally, you start thinking like, wow, I gotta really, you know, get my insurance in order and get all my, you know, my money in place.
[00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:27.202]  I start thinking much more business-wise, I become much more ambitious, almost instantaneously.
[00:03:27.322 --> 00:03:28.582]  Exactly, that's what happened to me.
[00:03:28.622 --> 00:03:31.723]  I used to let people push me around and stuff because I was kind of a nice guy.
[00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:33.243]  I kind of turned into a meanie.
[00:03:33.303 --> 00:03:34.163]  People push you around?
[00:03:34.183 --> 00:03:34.884]  That's ridiculous.
[00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.124]  Well, I got a lot meaner after I had kids, is the point.
[00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:37.584]  Really?
[00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:38.024]  Yeah.
[00:03:38.504 --> 00:03:43.165]  Well, I think it definitely makes a person more serious.
[00:03:43.885 --> 00:03:46.606]  I've had friends that had kids and they would describe it.
[00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:48.381]  I never really got it.
[00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:50.442]  I'm like, okay, so what happens?
[00:03:50.762 --> 00:03:53.103]  You're working more now and that's good?
[00:03:53.643 --> 00:03:54.503]  What's it all about?
[00:03:54.523 --> 00:03:58.924]  But once you have one, you go, oh, it's like a biological thing.
[00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:07.167]  It's like your body is preparing you for the fact that you've got to take on this little responsibility, this little person to protect it.
[00:04:07.487 --> 00:04:13.509]  So you become more aware of protecting the nest and more aware of gathering up supplies.
[00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:14.689]  It's really weird.
[00:04:15.342 --> 00:04:18.424]  No man, with our first child, you should have seen me and my wife.
[00:04:18.864 --> 00:04:23.586]  It was like birds building a nest, running around and doing this and getting everything just right.
[00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:26.728]  It's a strange thing to realize it's just an animal, isn't it?
[00:04:26.748 --> 00:04:32.991]  It's no different than a monkey, no different than a dog, just a different kind of animal.
[00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:36.752]  Well, we certainly are programmed, and we certainly have templates we follow.
[00:04:36.952 --> 00:04:38.252]  In fact, I want to talk about that today.
[00:04:38.272 --> 00:04:45.233]  You've got an interesting view on humanity and everything else, and I want to get your take on your views on that now.
[00:04:46.254 --> 00:04:48.094]  On the other side, with Joe Rogan.
[00:04:48.194 --> 00:04:48.934]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:48.974 --> 00:04:51.375]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:54.295]  His website is JoeRogan.net.
[00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:57.416]  That link's up to it on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:05:03.763 --> 00:05:05.444]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:05:05.744 --> 00:05:09.145]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:05:09.365 --> 00:05:10.945]  Let me talk to Joe.
[00:05:10.965 --> 00:05:17.547]  On humanity and everything else, and I want to get your take on your views on that now.
[00:05:18.588 --> 00:05:20.448]  On the other side with Joe Rogan.
[00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:21.288]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:21.308 --> 00:05:23.709]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:26.610]  His website is joerogan.net.
[00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.751]  That links up to it on infowars.com right now.
[00:05:36.053 --> 00:05:37.714]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:05:38.014 --> 00:05:41.455]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:43.476]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:05:44.096 --> 00:05:46.817]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:05:47.117 --> 00:05:52.599]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:56.760]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.001]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:05.062]  PrisonPlanet.TV is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:23.045]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.

[00:06:34.181 --> 00:06:34.922]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:06:36.408 --> 00:06:45.154]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:06:45.334 --> 00:06:50.117]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:06:50.478 --> 00:07:01.425]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:07:01.425 --> 00:07:02.525]  We're good to go.

[00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:37.503]  Attention GCN listeners.
[00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:41.746]  Would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[00:07:41.846 --> 00:07:53.354]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[00:07:53.734 --> 00:07:54.575]  Here's the story.
[00:07:54.895 --> 00:08:02.741]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:04.062]  And here's the best part.
[00:08:04.842 --> 00:08:10.864]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:11.464 --> 00:08:14.505]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:29.831]  He's Joe Rogan, ladies and gentlemen, and he's agreed to ride shotgun with Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor of the Manson family and best-selling author.
[00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:33.612]  He's got a new book out about how Bush is a murderer and needs to be arrested immediately.
[00:08:34.252 --> 00:08:37.032]  A very respected prosecutor and expert on criminology.
[00:08:37.393 --> 00:08:39.913]  So, Joe Rogan will be riding shotgun with us for that hour.
[00:08:40.613 --> 00:08:42.573]  Coming up next hour, that is going to be amazing.
[00:08:42.853 --> 00:08:45.054]  Joe Rogan and Vincent Bugliosi on together.
[00:08:45.294 --> 00:08:48.674]  But he'll be with us, just Joe alone, for this hour.
[00:08:49.275 --> 00:08:51.455]  Joe, I want to talk about your comedy.
[00:08:51.575 --> 00:08:53.775]  Well, we can't talk about your new TV show that's coming out yet.
[00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:54.796]  You can't talk about that yet.
[00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:56.636]  I want to talk about DMT.
[00:08:56.676 --> 00:08:58.356]  I want to talk about government-sponsored terror.
[00:08:58.796 --> 00:09:00.056]  I want to get into moon landings.
[00:09:00.076 --> 00:09:02.877]  I want to get into your world view, because I was Googling your name last night.
[00:09:03.337 --> 00:09:09.179]  Ended up spending about two hours watching different clips of you and your internet reality show you do that's amazing.
[00:09:09.199 --> 00:09:10.819]  Ought to be on mainstream TV.
[00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:12.880]  But I guess it's too hardcore.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.602]  Where you did this rant on another radio show about flying over cities and how cities look like cancers.
[00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:25.784]  And then you were talking about taking DMT and how there's this other reality while we're sleeping.
[00:09:26.764 --> 00:09:32.386]  And it was all just an amazing rant you were doing, but I thought, why play somebody else's show?
[00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:43.729]  Why not just have Joe talk about that, but add, because this rant was about a year ago, you've now had a child, you say you, which, which, which, which, I think what you just said about having a child fits into what you said previously.
[00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:55.232]  Does having a child confirm your view about how we are really a, kind of like a jellyfish, we are a group organism, but we individually, I don't think, realize that.
[00:09:55.854 --> 00:09:57.715]  Yeah, I think for sure.
[00:09:57.735 --> 00:09:59.297]  The way I compare it is to mold.
[00:09:59.937 --> 00:10:03.520]  When you see mold, you don't see individual spores of mold.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.281]  You see a patch.
[00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:08.103]  And that's really what human beings are.
[00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:13.668]  We think of ourselves as individuals, but we need all the other people around us constantly.
[00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:19.112]  If you're in jail, the worst punishment they can give you is put you in solitary confinement.
[00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:21.154]  Take you away from other prisoners.
[00:10:21.174 --> 00:10:22.535]  I mean, how crazy is that?
[00:10:22.916 --> 00:10:34.187]  I mean, if that doesn't just show you that there's some sort of a biological need to stay in contact with other people, because we are a group organism, it's an illusion that we're not.
[00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:42.315]  And if you look at the way this group organism is devouring the planet, killing off all the other organisms,
[00:10:42.671 --> 00:10:49.315]  It's just like an out-of-control bacteria or a virus or, you know, or just a parasite.
[00:10:49.455 --> 00:10:58.421]  Any kind of other animal that could overtake, you know, like when some, you know, crazy roach gets into a community and gets in everyone's houses and they can't get rid of them, they can't exterminate them.
[00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:00.102]  I mean, that's really what humans are like.
[00:11:00.122 --> 00:11:01.783]  We're like any other organism.
[00:11:01.803 --> 00:11:13.732]  We're just conscious, and we communicate, and we like to depict ourselves in unnatural ways, and we get confused, and we start to think that that depiction is the reality.
[00:11:14.272 --> 00:11:22.638]  But the reality, when you look at what humans are doing to the world, what we're doing to each other, we're just a really complicated, screwed-up animal.
[00:11:24.036 --> 00:11:30.101]  Now, I don't want to get out of the gates and get into a debate with you, because I agree with some of what you're saying and don't with others.
[00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:38.127]  I mean, that thousand plus square mile thing of plastic trash floating around in the Pacific Ocean right now, that is a problem.
[00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:44.612]  Genetic engineering, these cross-species organisms that have been put out are already wreaking havoc.
[00:11:45.353 --> 00:11:52.439]  GMO food that we produced, you know, that literally kills all the rats they feed it to, we're eating that, it's causing all these health problems.
[00:11:52.919 --> 00:12:02.745]  But we can certainly be a cancer, or we can be something that terraforms other planets, and I see our real potential as a life spreader, a life seeder.
[00:12:03.106 --> 00:12:06.588]  So I think like with everything in the world, it's a double-edged sword.
[00:12:06.608 --> 00:12:09.970]  And you think our potential is to seed
[00:12:12.793 --> 00:12:14.454]  Yes, and to terraform.
[00:12:14.594 --> 00:12:25.305]  We're going to go in, no doubt if we don't destroy ourselves with these superconducting heavy reactors and the antimatter weapons the Air Force admits they have but won't declassify the details on.
[00:12:25.926 --> 00:12:28.208]  If we don't destroy ourselves, yes, we're going to spread life.
[00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:36.235]  And so, will we consume the yolk, you know, like a chicken embryo that's our planet?
[00:12:36.716 --> 00:12:40.399]  Yes, but when we get to our true potential, we're going to be able to create thousands of worlds.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:56.353]  Well, our real problem is that everything we do to this world, everything we do, like with our materialism and the way we live our lives, the gas that we use and everything, it's damaging the Earth, but I don't think we feel it, personally.
[00:12:57.682 --> 00:13:00.344]  You know, and I think that's a big problem with human beings.
[00:13:00.384 --> 00:13:08.608]  Well, Joe, we do feel it when we get cancer from the dioxins that get in the water and the air, and we do feel it when our three-year-old dies of leukemia because they took the vaccines.
[00:13:09.169 --> 00:13:09.709]  Oh, of course.
[00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:12.871]  No, listen, I'm 100% with you.
[00:13:12.891 --> 00:13:21.056]  What I'm saying is that the only way we're going to ever get people to live a sustainable life is to make it
[00:13:21.929 --> 00:13:22.589]  I don't think so.
[00:13:41.089 --> 00:13:50.415]  To the point where we don't have a voting system in place like we do now that makes no sense with electoral college and votes and delegates and what are you talking about?
[00:13:50.915 --> 00:13:53.457]  And all this nonsense, this two-party nonsense.
[00:13:54.097 --> 00:14:01.202]  Like, it's going to take a lot of work to get rid of all this BS that we have that's clogging up the pores of this culture.
[00:14:01.522 --> 00:14:06.966]  And this is the most, supposedly, at least we like to consider ourselves, the most advanced culture in the world.
[00:14:07.026 --> 00:14:08.787]  And it's childlike!
[00:14:09.634 --> 00:14:19.968]  I mean, that's the most amazing aspect about life, is that there are grown children and they're operating the world like it's a Harry Potter movie.
[00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.651]  Well, Joe, that's what happens.
[00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:32.714]  Humans, when they're stressed and pushed to the edge of endurance, do incredible, magical, dynamic things.
[00:14:32.754 --> 00:14:40.096]  But when we have milk and honey, when we have it too good, we do become lazy, we do become decadent, we do become slothful.
[00:14:40.416 --> 00:14:47.138]  But the establishment, the social engineers, if you read their own documents, they have fostered and pushed our already weak instincts.
[00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.479]  They didn't create it, but they know how to punch our buttons.
[00:14:50.714 --> 00:14:59.321]  Kind of like the devil says in that film with Al Pacino, Devil's Advocate, he says, I know every button, every thing to push, every lever to pull.
[00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:00.622]  That's what Madison Avenue knows.
[00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:12.571]  And so they openly in their own documents, and I can give these to you if you want, you might have already seen them, say a hundred years ago they were going to push and control and make us dumb, make us decadent, feed into that feedback loop to get the general public
[00:15:13.171 --> 00:15:13.832]  It's a disease.
[00:15:36.216 --> 00:15:38.498]  You know, it's... I don't know.
[00:15:38.598 --> 00:15:43.823]  The whole conversation is very... It's like, what came first, the chicken or the egg?
[00:15:43.863 --> 00:15:46.646]  Have people always been lazy, or is somebody making people lazy?
[00:15:47.026 --> 00:15:48.187]  You know, I think both.
[00:15:48.607 --> 00:15:57.615]  And I think, you know, if there's going to be real leaders in this world, you know, if there's going to be a real leader, it's not going to be a leader that's coming from this system that we have right now.
[00:15:57.635 --> 00:15:59.037]  Because this system is a mess.
[00:15:59.847 --> 00:16:03.310]  Like, you need someone who's not trying to make any money.
[00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.212]  You need someone who's actually trying to help people.
[00:16:06.753 --> 00:16:08.494]  And that's very difficult to find.
[00:16:08.754 --> 00:16:14.339]  Well, Joe, the problem is, going back to the original point, is everybody wants to take care of their environment at an instinctive level.
[00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:15.019]  Doesn't mean we do.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.061]  And a lot of this sounds reasonable.
[00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:17.982]  Exactly.
[00:16:18.022 --> 00:16:20.684]  We don't feel it, like you said, consciously, though it is affecting us.
[00:16:21.846 --> 00:16:37.522]  The problem is the elites are going to use this to totally enslave us and do a lot of bad things, and I indict those elites and say, you know, your end doesn't justify your means, and you're doing more damage to the earth than the fake carbon taxes you're pushing, when carbon is what plants breathe.
[00:16:38.021 --> 00:16:38.181]  Right.
[00:16:38.221 --> 00:16:39.662]  Well, you know what I say, Alex?
[00:16:39.722 --> 00:16:41.342]  Those elites are just people.
[00:16:41.762 --> 00:16:47.284]  This is the whole thing about this whole idea of elites and the impoverished and the, you know, the proletariat.
[00:16:47.324 --> 00:16:49.605]  You know, what people are is just people.
[00:16:49.945 --> 00:17:03.509]  And these people, if they truly are manipulating world populations into wars and ruining lives and doing it all for profit and that they don't care, they can't be happy.
[00:17:03.929 --> 00:17:05.510]  Those guys aren't having any fun.
[00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:14.816]  Those elite dudes, they could use the advice that someone would give them if someone told them to just relax and have fun and stop being a douche.
[00:17:14.836 --> 00:17:16.657]  The problem is, it's not just about making money.
[00:17:16.997 --> 00:17:18.078]  It's about the power.
[00:17:18.398 --> 00:17:21.520]  And they're in such power positions, they've got a... Materialism.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.741]  It's about possessing things.
[00:17:22.861 --> 00:17:24.162]  Well, they're also psychopaths.
[00:17:24.242 --> 00:17:25.744]  I mean, see, you're not a psychopath, Joe.
[00:17:25.984 --> 00:17:33.270]  You care about your surroundings, because at an instinctive level, your genetic engineering is correct, and so you realize what happens to others affects you.
[00:17:33.331 --> 00:17:38.255]  You feel it and feel bad, but you're designed like that because hurting your tribe hurts you.
[00:17:38.635 --> 00:17:44.621]  There are jobs and positions in this world where it pays to be a psychopath.
[00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:52.694]  You know, and if you're going to be a politician, that's, you know, it really does pay you to be at least a little detached from the things that you're going to do.
[00:17:52.774 --> 00:17:53.214]  Exactly.
[00:17:53.234 --> 00:17:58.736]  I mean, if you really are planning, I mean, and I'm not saying that this is how it went down, but this is a big speculate.
[00:17:59.217 --> 00:18:04.679]  This is one thing that people speculate about all the time, that was this war created for profit?
[00:18:05.139 --> 00:18:12.903]  And if this war was created for profit, some people had to make that decision that it is worth X amount of lives for X amount of dollars.
[00:18:12.923 --> 00:18:14.484]  I mean, that is crazy!
[00:18:14.905 --> 00:18:16.898]  If that's a real decision that someone's making...
[00:18:17.315 --> 00:18:20.437]  Well, Joe, you're right, but they issue the currency.
[00:18:20.477 --> 00:18:28.581]  It's not just about making profits, it's about consolidating land, getting raw resources that they then peg to their fiat currencies.
[00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:36.305]  But, I mean, we have PNAC government documents where they admitted it was about oil and power and no-bid weapons contracts.
[00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:41.228]  I mean, the military... Well, if that's the case, it certainly pays to be a psychopath in that job, right?
[00:18:41.748 --> 00:18:42.208]  Absolutely.
[00:18:42.228 --> 00:18:43.929]  How do you fix a psychopath?
[00:18:43.969 --> 00:18:44.990]  That's the real problem.
[00:18:45.467 --> 00:18:53.692]  I mean, with a normal person that's trying to be ambitious and maybe cutting corners and doing the wrong thing, you can explain to that person karma.
[00:18:54.012 --> 00:18:57.254]  You can explain to that person that we are really just the same.
[00:18:57.294 --> 00:19:00.716]  We're just living lives through different circumstances.
[00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.437]  You can explain that to a book.
[00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:05.058]  Can you explain that to a psychopath?
[00:19:05.178 --> 00:19:06.159]  Is it even possible?
[00:19:08.556 --> 00:19:15.381]  And you raise them in that, you know, that environment, that ruthless, you know, future politician environment.
[00:19:15.401 --> 00:19:17.342]  I mean, can you fix that?
[00:19:17.582 --> 00:19:18.923]  Well, that's a good point you just made.
[00:19:18.943 --> 00:19:19.563]  That's central.
[00:19:21.505 --> 00:19:24.507]  This system is raising kind of a psychopath light.
[00:19:24.907 --> 00:19:27.189]  Oh yeah, there's a reason why all this skull and bone stuff.
[00:19:27.229 --> 00:19:28.369]  Everybody's like, that's silly.
[00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.391]  What are their little clubs that they join?
[00:19:30.631 --> 00:19:31.872]  There's a reason why that's real.
[00:19:32.836 --> 00:19:39.820]  But what we don't understand is there is an entire culture, like an ancient culture, in this country.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.040]  Wow.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.461]  It's been around for a long time.
[00:19:41.661 --> 00:19:42.142]  Society.
[00:19:42.202 --> 00:19:44.823]  People who are raising their children to be in power.
[00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:46.424]  And there's families... Huge.
[00:19:46.444 --> 00:19:47.865]  ...that have been in power forever.
[00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:57.111]  And the fact that people want to call that a conspiracy theory, or, like, what, how much evidence do you have to see before you want to look into it?
[00:19:57.191 --> 00:19:57.771]  Joe, stay there.

[00:20:20.374 --> 00:20:29.241]  And the fact that people want to call that a conspiracy theory, or like, what, how much evidence do you have to see before you want to look into it?
[00:20:29.481 --> 00:20:30.062]  Joe, stay there.

[00:24:48.815 --> 00:24:49.756]  So many other hats.
[00:24:50.056 --> 00:24:55.058]  The host of the commentator for Ultimate Fighting Championships.
[00:24:55.078 --> 00:24:59.020]  Just did a big one this Saturday that I know most of my office went to.
[00:25:00.976 --> 00:25:02.917]  Got a new addition to the family, so I couldn't go.
[00:25:02.957 --> 00:25:03.618]  Wish I could have.
[00:25:04.338 --> 00:25:06.340]  But Joe Rogan joins us.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.982]  My websites, of course, are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:10.263 --> 00:25:19.349]  Joe, flesh that out, because that's a point I've made before, but rarely do, and it's so central how you have lots of even low-level, petty elites that think they're members of the elite.
[00:25:19.629 --> 00:25:25.774]  They're trained to hate the general public, that the public's to be fed on, and when you get to skull and bones level and royalty level,
[00:25:26.474 --> 00:25:42.868]  It's even admitted in mainstream books that they train them to be cold-blooded and enslave the public and to have this us-against-them mentality and they're really, they're breeding almost a psychopathic view into them and that's what the mock sacrifices are about and the devil worship is about.
[00:25:43.289 --> 00:25:50.956]  It's how an old guy sends his son to have his peers induct him into a predator's mindset.
[00:25:51.436 --> 00:25:52.437]  Your take on that, Joe?
[00:25:52.757 --> 00:26:06.067]  Well, I mean, I think if you are the type of person that wants to be, you know, an elite, if you're the type of person that really wants to, you know, to run things in this world and manipulate people and make money, I mean, you have to be a psycho.
[00:26:06.527 --> 00:26:09.910]  And your kids are going to be psychos, too, because you're going to raise your kids.
[00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:15.414]  If you keep them in that environment and you have your kids grow up and seek political offices and
[00:26:15.814 --> 00:26:16.135]  We're good.
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:35.867]  And, you know, they stay together, and these groups and these families that have been around, they've been around for hundreds of years doing this.
[00:26:36.187 --> 00:26:38.529]  I mean, it's not like it's hard to follow.
[00:26:38.969 --> 00:26:40.631]  You can see the bloodlines.
[00:26:40.691 --> 00:26:52.901]  You can see, like, all the memberships in these little weird skull and bones things, and the fact that they all go to similar schools, and, you know, they're in similar clubs, and, like, you know, it's kind of crazy.
[00:26:53.101 --> 00:27:10.250]  In fact, the eugenicists over a hundred and fifty years ago, and now this has been in the BBC and all the news, they believe, there was just a big report out of a British university last week, that the elites are their own species because they've been intermarrying for, quote, aggression, intelligence.
[00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.812]  They already believe they're another species and see, Joe, they're going to use the environmental movement.
[00:27:14.832 --> 00:27:16.073]  I need to send you my new film, Endgame.
[00:27:16.553 --> 00:27:19.595]  Wow, that's a really interesting theory, like, sort of like
[00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:23.357]  It's sort of like a different breed, like different breeds of dogs.
[00:27:23.757 --> 00:27:24.537]  That's what they say.
[00:27:24.937 --> 00:27:45.787]  They say that by like being with like, they say through social Darwinism, the fact that they are in control gives them a right to kill, destroy, poison us, because it's the survival of the fittest, and now they're going to use the environmental movement, which sounds reasonable, to set up a world government, and then have the orderly bioweapon release and kill 80-90% of us.
[00:27:47.093 --> 00:27:49.314]  You know, that's a really interesting thought.
[00:27:49.554 --> 00:27:52.835]  The thought that they're a separate species now, or at least a separate race.
[00:27:53.195 --> 00:27:55.476]  You know, because I've had a lot of dogs.
[00:27:55.656 --> 00:27:56.516]  I love dogs.
[00:27:56.976 --> 00:27:59.217]  And I've had pit bulls.
[00:27:59.237 --> 00:28:02.077]  And they're great dogs with people.
[00:28:02.478 --> 00:28:06.319]  But man, they're so dangerous with other animals.
[00:28:06.759 --> 00:28:10.260]  They're like, I had one dog, she killed two of my other dogs.
[00:28:11.703 --> 00:28:13.124]  She would fight to the death.
[00:28:13.585 --> 00:28:14.405]  She just wanted to fight.
[00:28:14.846 --> 00:28:15.546]  She was crazy.
[00:28:15.746 --> 00:28:16.667]  No matter what it was.
[00:28:16.947 --> 00:28:19.649]  If you pissed her off, you did something wrong, she wanted to fight.
[00:28:19.849 --> 00:28:21.130]  And I've had her since she was a baby.
[00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.272]  I rescued her when she was like 11 months old from the dog pound.
[00:28:24.653 --> 00:28:26.174]  That dog is bred for that.
[00:28:26.194 --> 00:28:27.515]  That's in her system.
[00:28:28.055 --> 00:28:32.838]  And the way they made pit bulls is by breeding them for like a thousand years.
[00:28:32.879 --> 00:28:34.159]  I mean, who knows how long they've been doing it.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.801]  But for hundreds of years at least.
[00:28:36.041 --> 00:28:37.642]  The most aggressive dogs.
[00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:46.536]  And they bred a terrier with a larger bulldog, and they got this dog that was a medium-sized, psychotic animal.
[00:28:46.756 --> 00:28:54.000]  And then once they got the breed, what they did was they made sure that they only kept alive and breeding the ones that would fight to the death.
[00:28:54.461 --> 00:28:57.863]  Any dog that would quit, they would kill him, and they wouldn't let him breed.
[00:28:58.183 --> 00:28:59.384]  They would cull him from the breed.
[00:29:00.114 --> 00:29:06.403]  So the ones that they got out of that are this pure genetic specimen of just a destroyer.
[00:29:06.543 --> 00:29:06.883]  That's it!
[00:29:07.003 --> 00:29:08.606]  And that's the New World Order, brother!
[00:29:08.906 --> 00:29:14.593]  And they're in control of the bioweapons, they brainwashed the police, and they... No, no, they openly say they're gonna kill us.
[00:29:15.094 --> 00:29:36.268]  Even though people, like, will frown on conspiracy theories and say, this is ridiculous, you're making a lot of speculation, and you're coming to conclusions that aren't necessarily bound by logic, if you really looked at it that way, just genetically, it is really possible that there are a group of people that are just genetically more inclined to be douchey.
[00:29:36.569 --> 00:29:39.290]  Genetically more inclined to want to be an elite.
[00:29:39.731 --> 00:29:44.514]  Genetically more inclined to want to subjugate the population and ruin people's lives.
[00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:45.414]  Joe Rogan, stay there.
[00:29:45.434 --> 00:29:51.598]  We're going to talk behind scenes right now, uncensored, for three minutes at the Infowars.com screens, back worldwide in three minutes.
[00:29:53.699 --> 00:29:55.500]  Hey Joe, let's continue.
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.102]  Man, that is... I mean, I'm really glad you brought that point up, because it made me think of these other points.
[00:30:00.142 --> 00:30:05.785]  I need to send you, or watch it for free on Google Video, the film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:30:06.285 --> 00:30:07.526]  This is their own document.
[00:30:07.546 --> 00:30:12.269]  See, the common sense that you're agreeing with, and your own, you know, things you discovered on your own,
[00:30:13.349 --> 00:30:17.350]  This is separately what, in the last two years, I found out is their whole view.
[00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:38.355]  I mean, you know about social Darwinism, where they took Darwinism a step further and said, it's good to put people in sausage machines and enslave people and kill protesters because, you know, a hundred years ago, because we're the elite and, you know, the scum isn't an elite because they're scum, we have a right to kill them, when really they're like a cancer malfunctioning who's willing to kill their own people.
[00:30:38.695 --> 00:30:40.477]  Well, there's got to be something to that.
[00:30:41.097 --> 00:30:42.558]  They really are like cancer.
[00:30:42.618 --> 00:30:45.321]  I mean, but maybe that's the function that they serve.
[00:30:45.361 --> 00:30:48.063]  Maybe that's a natural part of the human organism.
[00:30:48.563 --> 00:30:50.845]  You know, that's another thing that I've been thinking a lot about lately.
[00:30:51.346 --> 00:30:52.867]  About the way people behave.
[00:30:52.887 --> 00:30:55.309]  That we've behaved like this from the beginning of time.
[00:30:55.908 --> 00:31:00.290]  We've always been terrible and destroying our neighbors.
[00:31:00.711 --> 00:31:01.911]  Joe, that's what they say.
[00:31:02.271 --> 00:31:04.332]  They say somebody's going to kill the neighbors.
[00:31:04.773 --> 00:31:07.334]  They say somebody's going to do it, so we might as well do it.
[00:31:07.914 --> 00:31:16.919]  Right, but do you think that if you... I mean, there's people that believe that everything in life is natural, and that there's an order to the world.
[00:31:16.979 --> 00:31:20.060]  It's almost like some gigantic mathematical program.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:20.400]  There is.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.461]  It's like King of the Jungle.
[00:31:22.168 --> 00:31:23.350]  Yeah, it is like that.
[00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:27.696]  And if that is the case, maybe that's just what happens.
[00:31:27.996 --> 00:31:33.785]  Like what we were talking about earlier, like with times of great wealth that people get lazy.
[00:31:34.918 --> 00:31:35.158]  Yes.
[00:31:35.478 --> 00:31:41.281]  You know, and that people, uh, they allow things to happen because there's too much, too much bounty.
[00:31:41.381 --> 00:31:42.142]  Everything's great.
[00:31:42.402 --> 00:31:44.062]  They don't worry about things and people get fat.
[00:31:44.082 --> 00:31:46.244]  And so they don't appreciate anything until everything goes to hell.
[00:31:46.724 --> 00:31:47.004]  Right.
[00:31:47.344 --> 00:31:48.385]  Maybe that's natural.
[00:31:48.745 --> 00:31:50.386]  Maybe when people get lazy.
[00:31:50.406 --> 00:31:57.009]  I mean, all these people that believe, you know, that, you know, there's hurricanes attacking New Orleans because there's gay people there.
[00:31:57.309 --> 00:31:59.330]  God wants to punish them for their sloth.
[00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:05.172]  Maybe not really, but maybe there is a punishment for that.
[00:32:05.412 --> 00:32:07.472]  Maybe it's not like a hurricane that comes in.
[00:32:07.752 --> 00:32:13.074]  Maybe it's an increased supply of these people who take advantage of other people.
[00:32:13.354 --> 00:32:17.875]  Increased supply of companies that are willing to destroy the environment for profit.
[00:32:18.275 --> 00:32:22.698]  By the way, Joe, I've interviewed the father of weather weapons, meteorologist Ben Livingston.
[00:32:22.818 --> 00:32:34.967]  In 1967, they had certified they could create hurricanes, kill them, make them stronger, steer them, and there's a lot of evidence that the government was manipulating Katrina and steering it.
[00:32:35.407 --> 00:32:40.110]  Well, we know for sure that the government can do something to the weather.
[00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.852]  We know they've been working on it for a long time.
[00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:48.674]  You know, they've been trying to do it for a long time, but to the extent, what they've got, they're not going to tell us.
[00:32:49.255 --> 00:32:53.718]  You know, so it's all like, who knows whether or not they can actually steer hurricanes.
[00:32:53.758 --> 00:32:55.580]  It doesn't seem like they can do it.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.361]  Well, but... It seems like a pretty big thing.
[00:32:57.621 --> 00:32:59.243]  Well, no, no, they can do unlimited aircraft.
[00:32:59.283 --> 00:33:00.864]  Let me... Just Google Ben Livingston.
[00:33:00.884 --> 00:33:01.485]  How do you do it?
[00:33:01.505 --> 00:33:04.447]  Well, just with the... Is it proven?
[00:33:04.747 --> 00:33:08.250]  Yes, this is certified, but it wasn't declassified until two years ago.
[00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:09.291]  Here we go, Joe.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:25.486]  Big Sam left Seattle in the year of 92 With George Pratt, his partner, and brother Billy, too They crossed the Yukon River and found the Bonanza Gold
[00:33:39.732 --> 00:33:46.074]  We're back live.
[00:33:46.134 --> 00:33:47.915]  Joe Rogan is our guest.
[00:33:47.955 --> 00:33:50.396]  JoeRogan.net.
[00:33:51.956 --> 00:34:00.800]  Joe, before we go any further, I want to get into the war, electronic voting machines, DMT, ultimate fighting, all of it before Vincent Bugliosi joins us.
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:01.900]  You're going to ride shotgun then.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.702]  I want to first thank you for taking the time out to join us, especially with having a new baby in the last three weeks.
[00:34:07.402 --> 00:34:14.645]  And I want to thank you for your friendship and all the laughs you've given me and the times we've had to hang out here in Austin and out in L.A.
[00:34:14.665 --> 00:34:16.726]  It's good to be talking to you after a few years being out of touch.
[00:34:17.547 --> 00:34:22.689]  But just anything you want to mention about your website, what you're doing these days, any plugs?
[00:34:23.559 --> 00:34:24.399]  No, not really.
[00:34:24.439 --> 00:34:30.502]  If they want to learn anything about me, JoeRogan.net is a website where I keep a fairly regular blog.
[00:34:30.562 --> 00:34:34.204]  I'll do a new blog post soon.
[00:34:34.484 --> 00:34:38.626]  I'll try to be a lot more regular, but having the kid has thrown me off a little bit.
[00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:39.346]  That's my excuse.
[00:34:39.686 --> 00:34:41.047]  That's going to be my excuse for everything.
[00:34:44.053 --> 00:34:45.114]  Yeah, I've had it for a while.
[00:34:45.134 --> 00:34:45.875]  I've had a message board.
[00:34:45.895 --> 00:34:48.217]  I've got this crazy message board, man, and I put it up, I think, in like
[00:34:57.461 --> 00:35:24.623]  Ninety-eight or ninety-nine or something like that, and this message board has got like a million, six hundred thousand posts on it, and all these members that post every day, and they're really cool people, like a lot of them, like, really interesting and intelligent, and there's these crazy debates on there, and some of them are really, really nutty, like there's, uh, you know, there's of course your 9-11 debates, and there's UFO debates, and moon landing debates, and mixed martial arts debates,
[00:35:25.143 --> 00:35:30.425]  But it's a really interesting little group of human beings that hang out there all the time.
[00:35:30.965 --> 00:35:32.805]  I feel very fortunate to have that.
[00:35:41.688 --> 00:35:45.310]  On the supposed destroyers, the Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:49.592]  That resulted in 58,000 dead Americans and a million plus dead Vietnamese.
[00:35:50.112 --> 00:35:53.854]  We know now with Building 7 and the firefighters saying, get back, they're going to blow it up.
[00:35:54.074 --> 00:35:54.935]  We have that on video.
[00:35:55.295 --> 00:36:00.077]  I mean, we have the firefighters saying there was molten lava under the other buildings that Jet Fuel couldn't do.
[00:36:00.878 --> 00:36:03.239]  We have the war games that day, NORAD standing down.
[00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:04.579]  I mean, I've
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.641]  Well, I question everything all the time about everything.
[00:36:07.661 --> 00:36:07.821]  I don't...
[00:36:21.087 --> 00:36:27.511]  I don't believe anything until it gets into my brain and bounces around and I look at it logically.
[00:36:27.911 --> 00:36:37.136]  I've seen way too many people just jump to conclusions or pick a side and as soon as they get on that side, they chase that side until they die.
[00:36:37.476 --> 00:36:39.498]  They never admit that they made a mistake.
[00:36:39.798 --> 00:36:40.958]  And that's a horrible thing.
[00:36:41.259 --> 00:36:46.422]  And people confuse information and truth.
[00:36:47.262 --> 00:36:47.962]  With their own ego.
[00:36:48.182 --> 00:36:51.264]  They make an investment, I totally agree, in an idea.
[00:36:51.664 --> 00:37:14.833]  Once somebody says I'm a reptoid from planet Pop-Tart, they have to only say that and add whatever evidence, or once they say I'm a Vatican assassin of the Keebler Elves, they only, you know, all their slander, all their libel, all their stalking, you know, saying the Zionists run it all and I'm bad, they, you know, because I won't buy into their particular camp, then I have to be the devil incarnate, and they only find evidence to agree with that.
[00:37:15.546 --> 00:37:21.871]  Well, and people might point that same finger in your direction and say that you look for conspiracy in everything.
[00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:27.335]  You know, that you believe there's complicity at the highest levels in everything, right?
[00:37:27.695 --> 00:37:30.357]  And there's some people that would say that there's not enough evidence for that.
[00:37:30.417 --> 00:37:31.898]  But my methodology's different.
[00:37:32.038 --> 00:37:36.602]  I go off their own Rand Corporation, Carnegie Endowment, their own program.
[00:37:37.372 --> 00:37:45.314]  You see, what disturbs me the most about you, Alex, is that the stuff that I used to think was completely ridiculous, I'm starting to think is real.
[00:37:46.674 --> 00:38:00.978]  That's what disturbs me the most about our friendship, is that when I first met Alex, I was like, okay, this dude's really interesting, and he says some stuff that sounds like 40% true, 60% donkey poo, you know?
[00:38:01.338 --> 00:38:03.519]  But now it's like, it's way more like 70-30.
[00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:08.612]  You know, it's hard to disagree with you on a lot of things.
[00:38:08.632 --> 00:38:08.992]  Well, thank you, Joe.
[00:38:09.152 --> 00:38:10.813]  Well, it's hard to disagree with you on a lot of stuff.
[00:38:10.973 --> 00:38:12.514]  But, I mean, specifically 9-11.
[00:38:12.754 --> 00:38:13.054]  Building 7.
[00:38:13.094 --> 00:38:14.235]  Specifically 9-11.
[00:38:14.355 --> 00:38:19.578]  Look, I don't know enough about what happened to make... I'm not a scientist.
[00:38:19.858 --> 00:38:22.300]  I can't tell you whether or not those buildings fell like that.
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:22.760]  You know what?
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.361]  I think anybody saying that they can...
[00:38:24.941 --> 00:38:26.342]  A lot of that is speculation.
[00:38:26.382 --> 00:38:36.526]  The only way we're really going to know what happens when two giant planes hit two giant buildings is to build two more giant buildings and slam into it with two more giant planes.
[00:38:36.546 --> 00:38:39.047]  The Building 7 wasn't hit by one.
[00:38:39.067 --> 00:38:39.927]  You're right about Building 7.
[00:38:40.267 --> 00:38:49.371]  And Building 7 is the one building that I'm always willing to talk to people about because I find it very shocking that nobody thinks it's weird how that building fell.
[00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:53.733]  That that building kicked in the middle and fell like it was a controlled demolition.
[00:38:54.073 --> 00:38:55.393]  Was it a controlled demolition?
[00:38:55.654 --> 00:38:56.854]  I have no idea.
[00:38:57.134 --> 00:39:00.955]  I don't even really know what a controlled demolition looks like other than what I've seen on the internet.
[00:39:00.975 --> 00:39:05.137]  Well, the government would... Well, what I'm trying to say is, what I'm trying to say is, I don't know.
[00:39:05.577 --> 00:39:09.678]  But it's strange to me that people will go, ah, nothing happened.
[00:39:09.978 --> 00:39:10.839]  Nothing happened.
[00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:11.779]  Nothing happened.
[00:39:11.959 --> 00:39:12.939]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:39:12.959 --> 00:39:14.480]  Are you looking at the same thing I'm looking at?
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.541]  Because I'm looking at a building falling into its footprint.
[00:39:18.041 --> 00:39:19.482]  Why is it falling into its footprint?
[00:39:19.782 --> 00:39:20.582]  That doesn't happen.
[00:39:20.602 --> 00:39:22.183]  There's damage in the building.
[00:39:22.343 --> 00:39:25.004]  When you look at the damage in the building, it's to one corner of the building.
[00:39:25.324 --> 00:39:39.589]  Again, I'm not a scientist, I'm not an engineer, I don't really understand physics that well, but I would assume that if there's a building that's being held up by four corners and one of them has a gigantic hole in it, it's going to fall towards that weak area.
[00:39:40.129 --> 00:39:42.590]  Why is it collapsing on all these other corners?
[00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.411]  And why is it doing it in such a uniform fashion?
[00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:47.592]  That doesn't seem natural to me.
[00:39:47.713 --> 00:39:49.374]  Well, you even have the blast squibs.
[00:39:49.394 --> 00:39:50.235]  You can even see them.
[00:39:51.035 --> 00:39:55.099]  I don't know if that's what that is, or if that's when buildings fall, or when buildings collapse.
[00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:59.182]  A lot of Silversteins say, we gave the order to pull it, and gave the order to watch it come down.
[00:39:59.562 --> 00:40:02.044]  I did hear that he said that, that we gave the order to pull it.
[00:40:02.104 --> 00:40:06.328]  But, you know, he was dealing with, I mean, I'm just playing devil's advocate here.
[00:40:06.588 --> 00:40:16.397]  This guy's dealing with this gigantic, cataclysmic event that just happened in a city where thousands of people died, and planes threw into buildings, and his building got jacked!
[00:40:17.018 --> 00:40:18.459]  And he's just, you know, pull it, pull it.
[00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:23.404]  Meaning, pull the project of trying to save his building, pull all the firefighters out.
[00:40:23.424 --> 00:40:25.066]  But pull it is a demolition term.
[00:40:25.086 --> 00:40:27.087]  It is, but he's not a demolition man!
[00:40:28.949 --> 00:40:32.394]  Why did BBC, Joe, have you seen that?
[00:40:32.414 --> 00:40:33.856]  I'm not saying that.
[00:40:33.876 --> 00:40:34.978]  It doesn't have anything to do with it.
[00:40:35.158 --> 00:40:37.822]  But do you see the point of view of the rational person?
[00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:38.463]  No, no, I understand.
[00:40:38.523 --> 00:40:42.008]  Look at it and say, well... Well, not rational, somebody in denial.
[00:40:42.928 --> 00:40:45.110]  I don't know if it's somebody in denial.
[00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:46.951]  I don't know what happened.
[00:40:47.151 --> 00:40:49.432]  I do know it looked very unusual.
[00:40:49.792 --> 00:40:51.614]  I absolutely agree with you there.
[00:41:00.259 --> 00:41:11.267]  Okay, well, to play devil's advocate, I could tell you that the firemen maybe had already told the press and warned them to get back, because Building 7, they have deemed, is about to collapse.
[00:41:11.667 --> 00:41:18.952]  And that got screwed up in the interpretation, again, with this huge cataclysmic event where planes are flying into the buildings, and everybody's freaking out.
[00:41:19.192 --> 00:41:21.854]  Like, there's all these people, we heard explosions before it happened.
[00:41:22.034 --> 00:41:26.157]  Do you really remember what happened before planes slammed into
[00:41:26.257 --> 00:41:26.777]  We're good to go.
[00:41:48.792 --> 00:41:53.141]  But we weren't talked into the fact that Tonkin was staged and 58,000 Americans died.
[00:41:53.302 --> 00:41:53.742]  I'm with you 100%.
[00:41:53.923 --> 00:41:56.348]  And they staged attacks to start the war with Iran in 1953.
[00:41:56.428 --> 00:41:58.312]  How about Operation Northwoods?
[00:41:58.332 --> 00:41:59.555]  How about the Northwoods document?
[00:42:00.225 --> 00:42:01.386]  That's scary!
[00:42:01.767 --> 00:42:06.030]  That Northwoods document, and if you don't know what I'm talking about, you can look at it online.
[00:42:06.451 --> 00:42:09.614]  It's a document that was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:42:09.654 --> 00:42:10.655]  When was it, Alex?
[00:42:10.675 --> 00:42:10.655]  61?
[00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:11.876]  62, yeah.
[00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:11.876]  62.
[00:42:12.136 --> 00:42:14.859]  It was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:42:14.879 --> 00:42:24.067]  This was a plan to fake terrorist attacks on American civilians and blame them on Cuba so that people would want to go to war with Cuba.
[00:42:24.788 --> 00:42:25.849]  They were going to kill people!
[00:42:27.421 --> 00:42:28.946]  They were gonna fake attack!
[00:42:29.348 --> 00:42:33.261]  One of them involved something with an airliner and a bunch of college students.
[00:42:33.562 --> 00:42:34.264]  Wasn't that the case?
[00:42:35.678 --> 00:42:36.258]  Absolutely.
[00:42:36.298 --> 00:42:40.179]  In fact, they were going to bomb D.C., they were going to commit sniper attacks, shoot Americans.
[00:42:40.399 --> 00:42:47.561]  They were going to have Cuban Americans dress up like Cuban Army and attack Guantanamo Bay, and it said mortar and shoot and bomb and kill people.
[00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:56.904]  Well, that's a horrifying thought, that if this was going on in 1962, in my opinion, the way I look at it, everything evolves.
[00:42:57.244 --> 00:42:58.124]  Everything evolves.
[00:42:58.584 --> 00:43:03.167]  Technology involves, entertainment involves, evolves, everything evolves.
[00:43:03.408 --> 00:43:05.609]  Well, if everything evolves, then evil has to evolve too.
[00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:20.700]  Okay, and if they're willing to fake attacks on American civilians and kill Americans in order to get us convinced that we need to go to war with a country that had nothing to do with those acts, if they were willing to do that in 62, what are they willing to do in 2008?
[00:43:22.065 --> 00:43:23.166]  We know that in real life.
[00:43:23.226 --> 00:43:24.146]  Well, Joe, exactly.
[00:43:24.186 --> 00:43:28.789]  Take the military mentality going back to Alexander the Great, you know, thousands of years ago.
[00:43:29.149 --> 00:43:36.133]  They would put a few hundred horsemen or a few thousand infantrymen in a gorge or in an area they wanted to attack to pull in the main army.
[00:43:36.934 --> 00:43:42.717]  And then when the enemy army would come in, it would sacrifice those few thousand, those pawns in the game, collateral damage.
[00:43:42.737 --> 00:43:47.240]  But then their argument was, but then we won the war and we lost less people total.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.963]  Well, that military idea... You believe that's people that are in a war.
[00:43:52.264 --> 00:43:52.804]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:43:52.824 --> 00:43:56.587]  If you're in a war, I mean, you've got to know that there's tactics and there's pawns.
[00:43:56.647 --> 00:44:03.472]  If you're paying attention to what war is, what we're dealing with in our society is a lie, like this big, like, ruse.
[00:44:04.213 --> 00:44:06.434]  Pretending that it's one thing when it's really something else.
[00:44:06.494 --> 00:44:15.201]  Pretending that there's democracy, when really what we have is this huge, gigantic group of human beings that are controlled by corporations.
[00:44:15.754 --> 00:44:16.014]  Yes, great.
[00:44:35.401 --> 00:44:38.344]  Yeah, it's compartmentalized, and so they all share the blame.
[00:44:38.724 --> 00:44:41.386]  None of them stab the people in the heart themselves.
[00:44:41.426 --> 00:44:45.930]  They collectively do it with blinders on, and so... And they say it's all for business.
[00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.191]  And then you... We're doing it in business.
[00:44:47.271 --> 00:44:48.072]  In the name of business.
[00:44:48.232 --> 00:44:48.552]  I agree.
[00:44:48.592 --> 00:45:03.125]  And then you can't ever stop them, because you go punish one of them, but it's the cellular organization, kind of like what you said an hour ago, or 45 minutes ago, that it's this communal thing, and so you can't ever beat the whole compartmentalized system, because you can only attack certain pieces of it.
[00:45:03.445 --> 00:45:06.748]  Right, and there's so much vested interest in keeping that corporation alive.
[00:45:06.948 --> 00:45:09.209]  There's so many mortgages attached to that corporation.
[00:45:09.229 --> 00:45:12.071]  There's so many kids that are in private school attached to that corporation.
[00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:13.873]  There's so many, you know, credit card bills.
[00:45:14.073 --> 00:45:16.495]  They want to keep that organization alive.
[00:45:16.555 --> 00:45:17.856]  That's a giant community.
[00:45:18.256 --> 00:45:23.560]  And what it is really, what any organization like that is really, is like an organism.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.445]  It's like we have this gigantic organism that's the human race, and inside we have little substructures.
[00:45:30.945 --> 00:45:37.006]  And we have cities, and we have mayors, and all that jazz, but corporations are like their own little substructure.
[00:45:37.026 --> 00:45:37.886]  Well, take the police!
[00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:48.868]  They now are just militarizing, doubling, tripling, quadrupling their numbers, growing wildly, and it's all about protecting themselves now, not the public.
[00:45:49.068 --> 00:45:51.349]  It's all about, quote, the officers and their system.
[00:45:51.369 --> 00:45:56.610]  Well, the crazy thing about the cops is the ones who are doing all the work aren't even the ones that
[00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:07.476]  I mean, the cops that are out there, you know, that are driving on the streets and are arresting people and, like, if they're really working for the New World Order, they're us!
[00:46:08.496 --> 00:46:09.917]  They're getting screwed more than anything!
[00:46:09.937 --> 00:46:10.557]  Oh, I agree, I say that.
[00:46:10.577 --> 00:46:11.418]  Because they're being forced.
[00:46:11.658 --> 00:46:12.759]  They're not making money out of it.
[00:46:12.779 --> 00:46:13.959]  It's not like cops are getting rich.
[00:46:13.999 --> 00:46:14.540]  No, I agree.
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:16.060]  Being a cop is a dangerous job.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.221]  They do it for the system.
[00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:18.442]  There's a lot of scumbags out there.
[00:46:18.462 --> 00:46:22.084]  Well, I mean, most cops mean well, but have been given a false template.
[00:46:22.384 --> 00:46:25.986]  They believe when they take a teenager to jail for some marijuana that it's a good thing.
[00:46:26.226 --> 00:46:32.868]  But I think because of the fact that most cops mean well, I think ultimately it's going to be very hard to have a police state.
[00:46:32.988 --> 00:46:34.729]  Because they'd be policing their own people.
[00:46:35.069 --> 00:46:36.309]  They'd be policing themselves.
[00:46:36.569 --> 00:46:46.612]  Well, Joe, I got stories here where a woman's drinking a glass of water and a wine glass with her child, and after going to the dentist and they pull her over in Phoenix and go ahead and take her to jail.
[00:46:47.012 --> 00:46:48.393]  She might have been a douchebag.
[00:46:49.053 --> 00:46:49.754]  You ever think of that?
[00:46:49.814 --> 00:46:50.294]  So she deserved it.
[00:46:50.314 --> 00:46:52.396]  She might have been a crazy pain in the ass.
[00:46:52.776 --> 00:46:57.499]  They might have pulled her over and she might have said a bunch of dumb stuff and yelled at the cops.
[00:46:57.519 --> 00:46:57.960]  So she deserves it.
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:58.660]  She might have been lying.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.461]  She might have been drunk.
[00:46:59.681 --> 00:47:00.742]  She might have been doing coke.
[00:47:00.762 --> 00:47:01.922]  She might have smoked a joint.
[00:47:02.203 --> 00:47:02.963]  Who knows?
[00:47:03.063 --> 00:47:03.904]  I don't know that lady.
[00:47:03.924 --> 00:47:05.025]  She might be a mass murderer.
[00:47:05.265 --> 00:47:06.246]  Let me tell you something.
[00:47:06.306 --> 00:47:08.527]  Every time I get pulled over by cops, you know what I say?
[00:47:08.907 --> 00:47:09.548]  Sorry, sir.
[00:47:09.828 --> 00:47:10.709]  Here's my license.
[00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:11.749]  Here's my registration.
[00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.110]  You know how many times I've been arrested?
[00:47:13.491 --> 00:47:14.191]  Zero.
[00:47:14.612 --> 00:47:15.172]  You know why?
[00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:16.333]  Because I respect cops.
[00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.534]  I know a lot of cops from Jiu Jitsu.
[00:47:18.834 --> 00:47:21.456]  I know a lot of cops from all my years of training martial arts.
[00:47:21.576 --> 00:47:22.376]  I've met a lot of them.
[00:47:22.636 --> 00:47:23.697]  And they're just dudes.
[00:47:24.017 --> 00:47:25.798]  They're dudes who want to get a job.
[00:47:25.838 --> 00:47:28.480]  They have a very stressful, screwed up job.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.701]  It's a compartmentalization, Joe, is what I'm saying.
[00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:38.065]  But what I'm saying is that if a lady gets pulled over drinking a glass of water, and they lock her in a cage, maybe there's some more to the story.
[00:47:38.425 --> 00:47:39.746]  Maybe that lady's crazy.
[00:47:39.826 --> 00:47:42.968]  Well, it was in the Phoenix Newspaper, so it's all right now.
[00:47:44.201 --> 00:47:44.983]  He's not a nut.
[00:47:45.003 --> 00:47:46.887]  He could easily be a nut.
[00:47:46.927 --> 00:47:49.232]  It's a good story to put in the Phoenix newspaper.
[00:47:49.452 --> 00:47:51.497]  It's a good version of it.
[00:47:51.537 --> 00:47:52.038]  Have you heard?
[00:47:52.098 --> 00:47:54.984]  Police are now running checkpoints taking blood, Joe.
[00:47:55.774 --> 00:48:00.738]  Listen, I've seen a lot of videos on YouTube of cops tasering dudes for no reason at all.
[00:48:01.359 --> 00:48:14.810]  I'm with you, that sometimes things go horribly wrong, and that those dudes are under a constant amount of stress, and sometimes when people don't comply, they have just heard enough, and they pull out that taser, and they blast them, and it makes for a very funny video online.
[00:48:15.311 --> 00:48:16.031]  I've seen it happen.
[00:48:16.051 --> 00:48:18.153]  But Joe, it's getting worse.
[00:48:18.553 --> 00:48:19.014]  Here's the deal.
[00:48:21.235 --> 00:48:22.096]  I understand.
[00:48:22.116 --> 00:48:23.897]  You're not supposed to give them a middle option.
[00:48:24.217 --> 00:48:28.159]  It's like, you remember in Star Trek, you know, they had the gun that was set to stun or to kill?
[00:48:28.519 --> 00:48:32.221]  No, look, it should only be kill, alright?
[00:48:32.241 --> 00:48:34.122]  You shouldn't be spanking people.
[00:48:34.403 --> 00:48:35.723]  I mean, people aren't children.
[00:48:35.743 --> 00:48:36.204]  I agree.
[00:48:36.224 --> 00:48:38.445]  You don't spank kids and you don't taser people.
[00:48:38.525 --> 00:48:39.365]  Joe, I want to shift gears.
[00:48:39.385 --> 00:48:42.767]  You shouldn't take someone out as if they're dangerous and you should kill them.
[00:48:43.067 --> 00:48:43.868]  You should just blast
[00:48:44.408 --> 00:48:45.548]  Joe Rogan.
[00:48:45.708 --> 00:48:46.989]  Joe Rogan, JoeRogan.net.
[00:48:47.229 --> 00:48:52.870]  I want to get Burmese in here for a minute because he's a big fan of Ultimate Fighting, big fan of yours, and he's one of the guys that made loose change.
[00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.170]  Go ahead and say hi to him.
[00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:55.810]  Hey Joe, how you doing?
[00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:57.391]  You want to say anything about 9-11 to him?
[00:48:58.131 --> 00:49:00.971]  I just wanted to check out, he should check out the Amalgam Virgo document.
[00:49:00.991 --> 00:49:09.413]  He talked about the Northwoods document, but Amalgam Virgo was the drill that they ran in June 1st and 2nd of 2001 where they actually drilled
[00:49:10.133 --> 00:49:14.476]  ramming a hijacked airliner into the Capitol building while other attacks were going on.
[00:49:14.496 --> 00:49:15.617]  And the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[00:49:15.677 --> 00:49:25.584]  Yeah, and it had a second part where they were actually going to do live-fly hijack exercises where they were going to have FBI agents on deck with a flight crew and then divert the planes to Alaska.
[00:49:25.924 --> 00:49:33.069]  So yeah, tell him, which is in Northwoods, but tell him Springman, the head of the embassy, the head, was told these are U.S.
[00:49:33.089 --> 00:49:35.010]  government agents, let the hijackers back in.
[00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.531]  Yeah, well, we just interviewed him again for this new film.
[00:49:37.551 --> 00:49:43.655]  Yeah, in the new film, Fabled Enemies, we have J. Michael Springman, who was the consulate at Jeddah in the visa department.
[00:49:43.735 --> 00:49:46.337]  His job was to give people visas or not give people visas.
[00:49:46.697 --> 00:49:52.441]  And his thing was, he was not giving a lot of these people visas, and then his superiors would be like, no, you need to give them a visa.
[00:49:52.861 --> 00:49:53.682]  And he was like, why?
[00:49:53.722 --> 00:49:56.224]  And they'd say, well, it's national security purposes.
[00:49:56.544 --> 00:49:59.686]  And then he talked to some of his buddies at the CIA, and they let him know
[00:50:00.166 --> 00:50:07.629]  That this was actually a program to bring Islamic militants into the United States to work with their asset, Osama Bin Laden.
[00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.550]  And, you know, the interview is just awesome.
[00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:10.871]  Now, did you just hear that, Joe?
[00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:11.771]  Yes, I did.
[00:50:11.851 --> 00:50:14.853]  And if that's true, that's really scary.
[00:50:15.273 --> 00:50:15.833]  And you know what?
[00:50:15.893 --> 00:50:18.074]  I believe it probably could be true, very easily.
[00:50:18.334 --> 00:50:19.615]  Now, here's my question, though.
[00:50:20.195 --> 00:50:25.938]  If there is something like this that happened, say if 9-11 was this gigantic staged act,
[00:50:26.485 --> 00:50:34.473]  And that they had set it up in advance and somehow or another had rigged the gigantic buildings so that they would, you know, be... What is it?
[00:50:34.513 --> 00:50:34.973]  Thermate?
[00:50:35.353 --> 00:50:37.736]  Thermate so it cuts through the metal and it brings the buildings down.
[00:50:37.776 --> 00:50:38.957]  That's the speculation, right?
[00:50:39.357 --> 00:50:39.617]  Yes.
[00:50:40.038 --> 00:50:41.179]  How many people had to be involved?
[00:50:42.262 --> 00:50:42.963]  About a hundred.
[00:50:42.983 --> 00:50:44.264]  We broke it down to about a hundred and twenty.
[00:50:44.324 --> 00:50:44.644]  Stay there.
[00:50:44.664 --> 00:50:50.550]  We're going to talk behind the scenes for InfoWars.com, folks, and for people watching in PrisonPlanet.tv with Joe Rogan.
[00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:53.213]  Then we'll be back for another five-minute segment, another five after that.
[00:50:53.553 --> 00:50:55.895]  Then he's going to ride shotgun with us with Vincent Luligosi.
[00:50:56.476 --> 00:50:56.916]  Stay with us.
[00:50:56.936 --> 00:50:58.518]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:58.538 --> 00:51:00.320]  Again, we'll continue behind the scenes right now.
[00:51:05.854 --> 00:51:24.319]  Joe, I appreciate your incredible courage to say you're even questioning it, but what I'm telling you is, this was the head of the embassy, and there's another guy who was the head of another embassy section in Canada, not just in Saudi Arabia, saying they were told, hey, these are government agents, assets, let them in.
[00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:25.459]  And we're talking Mohammed Addo.
[00:51:27.835 --> 00:51:32.156]  That, Alex, is that the FBI had two of these guys staying with an asset.
[00:51:32.216 --> 00:51:39.138]  In other words, Khalid al-Madar and Nawaf al-Zahami were actually staying with an FBI informant that was handled by an agent named Stephen Butler.
[00:51:39.278 --> 00:51:40.198]  That was in San Diego.
[00:51:40.418 --> 00:51:42.218]  Yeah, he was living with them in San Diego.
[00:51:42.258 --> 00:51:51.320]  Now, the official line is that they didn't even know that they were on the terrorism watch list until about two days after the attack, because they were in the United States illegally.
[00:51:51.521 --> 00:51:53.241]  But then you find out about Abel Danger,
[00:51:53.781 --> 00:51:59.586]  And two of these guys, the two guys that were living with the FBI informant, were two of the guys that Able Danger had actually identified.
[00:51:59.606 --> 00:52:00.487]  Joe, here's what happened.
[00:52:00.507 --> 00:52:01.608]  These were government agents.
[00:52:01.928 --> 00:52:03.309]  We know they even did mock drills.
[00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:05.131]  That's what James Woods saw.
[00:52:05.491 --> 00:52:06.312]  They got on board.
[00:52:06.412 --> 00:52:07.453]  Nerve gas was released.
[00:52:07.713 --> 00:52:11.617]  The few real calls we've got off air phones are the Sturdists going, ah, I can't breathe!
[00:52:11.837 --> 00:52:12.677]  Ah, something's in here!
[00:52:12.938 --> 00:52:15.140]  That, and then they were remote controlled, sir, that we know.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.701]  Do you have copies of those things?
[00:52:17.121 --> 00:52:19.003]  Yeah, well, yeah, no, I mean, we've got the transcripts.
[00:52:19.023 --> 00:52:20.404]  The government's released it and said, ah,
[00:52:21.645 --> 00:52:23.208]  There's the MP3s out there.
[00:52:23.248 --> 00:52:25.431]  You can listen to some of their phone calls.
[00:52:25.551 --> 00:52:27.134]  MP3s out there of these women?
[00:52:27.334 --> 00:52:27.995]  Yeah.
[00:52:28.716 --> 00:52:32.722]  They basically say that there's gas in the back and that they're having trouble breathing.
[00:52:32.862 --> 00:52:34.224]  They're pretty short conversations.
[00:52:34.244 --> 00:52:35.767]  What do you guys think happened?
[00:52:35.787 --> 00:52:37.269]  Do you believe that it was a remote
[00:52:37.509 --> 00:52:42.131]  Well, Joe, we were actually able, last August, to get NORAD's tape so we could listen to what they were hearing.
[00:52:42.151 --> 00:52:43.972]  And then you got arrested for that.
[00:52:43.992 --> 00:52:45.213]  They then came and SWAT teamed you.
[00:52:45.313 --> 00:52:46.514]  Well, that did happen, but whatever.
[00:52:46.534 --> 00:52:48.935]  Basically, they had about 20 different hijackings that day.
[00:53:06.744 --> 00:53:09.127]  You just whatevered a SWAT team arrest.
[00:53:09.207 --> 00:53:11.150]  Yeah, they came and grabbed Corey because they were on base.
[00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:12.211]  They scanned the place.
[00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:13.233]  I'll give you your balls.
[00:53:13.965 --> 00:53:14.566]  Well, whatever.
[00:53:14.586 --> 00:53:16.207]  You need a SWAT team of reps.
[00:53:16.548 --> 00:53:18.810]  And a camera machine gun, whatever.
[00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:20.652]  What?
[00:53:20.912 --> 00:53:21.693]  That's just life, man.
[00:53:21.713 --> 00:53:23.374]  Why are you making these documentaries, dude?
[00:53:23.535 --> 00:53:26.297]  I'm not sure if you really recognize what's going on here.
[00:53:26.337 --> 00:53:27.639]  Hey, someone's got to do it.
[00:53:27.679 --> 00:53:31.142]  But I do want to point out again, you know, they had other hijackings.
[00:53:31.162 --> 00:53:32.704]  They had hijackings coming out of Canada.
[00:53:33.104 --> 00:53:36.247]  After the flight 93 was down, they called up Cheyenne Mountain and said,
[00:53:37.168 --> 00:53:42.429]  You need to turn off these inputs on the drills because we can't tell which planes are actual hijackings.
[00:53:42.449 --> 00:53:44.289]  They had a hijacking out of Korea Airlines.
[00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:46.490]  They had a threat against Air Force One that day.
[00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:54.191]  Somehow these supposed hijackers had gotten all the secret codes to the NSA, the Secret Service, the FBI, the CIA that morning.
[00:53:54.311 --> 00:53:54.951]  Yeah, Joe!
[00:53:55.692 --> 00:53:58.072]  I'll tell you what, we got Bugliosi coming on for like 30 minutes.
[00:53:58.352 --> 00:54:00.152]  Joe has graciously said he'll stay with us a whole other hour.
[00:54:00.353 --> 00:54:01.573]  Why don't you come in after he's gone?
[00:54:01.693 --> 00:54:01.993]  You got it.
[00:54:02.013 --> 00:54:02.573]  Okay, here we go live.
[00:54:05.999 --> 00:54:12.402]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive.
[00:54:17.285 --> 00:54:23.248]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[00:54:24.793 --> 00:54:30.139]  But if you're Joe Rogan, you're a champion jujitsu guy, mixed martial arts, he'll beat up the mugger.
[00:54:32.101 --> 00:54:32.821]  Joe is really nice.
[00:54:32.841 --> 00:54:34.523]  He's agreed to stay with us a whole other hour.
[00:54:34.543 --> 00:54:38.748]  And we're going to have Burmus back in later to talk 9-11 with him.
[00:54:39.168 --> 00:54:39.709]  JoeRogan.net.
[00:54:41.771 --> 00:54:47.875]  Joe, I want to get back into 9-11 and other things later, but right now I wanted to talk about DMT and electronic voting machines.
[00:54:47.915 --> 00:54:52.098]  I know you've talked a lot about both those issues, and they're both pretty darn important.
[00:54:52.378 --> 00:54:55.480]  You want to get into DMT first and the type of experiences you've had?
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:55:00.583]  I mean, you're a big health guy, but you've taken this, I guess, as a spiritual experience or whatever.
[00:55:00.823 --> 00:55:02.264]  You want to tell folks what happens when you take it?
[00:55:02.284 --> 00:55:07.148]  I think that psychedelic experiences are the root of all religious experiences.
[00:55:07.448 --> 00:55:08.929]  That's what my personal belief is.
[00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:19.322]  I believe that these religious experiences that people have had without psychedelics are the result of natural endogenous dumps of psychedelics in your system.
[00:55:19.362 --> 00:55:22.426]  And this is from reading a lot of people's books.
[00:55:22.526 --> 00:55:23.747]  None of these are my ideas.
[00:55:23.767 --> 00:55:26.651]  Yeah, you eat some bad cheese and it's got DMT in it.
[00:55:26.711 --> 00:55:27.832]  It's in a lot of natural things.
[00:55:28.773 --> 00:55:29.273]  It's that simple.
[00:55:29.293 --> 00:55:40.179]  You can't really eat DMT, because DMT, your stomach produces something called monoamine oxidase, and it breaks down... You gotta smoke it, but I mean, there's other things that'll make it a hallucinating food, though.
[00:55:40.639 --> 00:55:53.225]  There's ways that they've been doing it for thousands of years in the Amazon, where they make a brew called ayahuasca, and what it is is the vine of one plant, and then the leaves of another plant, and it's mixed together, so it's DMT is in one of the plants,
[00:55:53.553 --> 00:55:54.093]  No, I understand.
[00:56:16.701 --> 00:56:19.563]  It exists and human beings make it naturally.
[00:56:19.623 --> 00:56:22.025]  They believe the pineal gland is what makes it.
[00:56:22.365 --> 00:56:25.727]  And what that means, what the pineal gland is, is literally your third eye.
[00:56:26.088 --> 00:56:32.612]  It's a gland in the middle of your forehead that in reptiles, in some reptiles, it actually has a retina and a cornea and a lens.
[00:56:32.632 --> 00:56:33.933]  I mean, it literally is the third eye.
[00:56:34.233 --> 00:56:34.854]  And this is where
[00:56:35.334 --> 00:56:41.444]  All the anecdotal evidence points to that this gland is producing this crazy chemical.
[00:56:41.684 --> 00:56:45.550]  It's produced in your body, wherever it is, whatever makes it.
[00:56:45.631 --> 00:56:46.993]  When you take this stuff,
[00:56:47.671 --> 00:57:02.302]  You encounter the most unbelievably beautiful experience, ultimate wisdom, being in front of something that exposes every single aspect of your personality, of your thoughts, everything you've ever said and done.
[00:57:02.342 --> 00:57:09.288]  It's like, reads you right through you, connects you to everything in the world, and you're being communicated with.
[00:57:09.828 --> 00:57:11.690]  Something is talking to you, and it's
[00:57:12.527 --> 00:57:15.790]  Whatever it is, you're looking at it and it's constantly changing.
[00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:22.336]  And it looks like, the way I describe it, I say it's like complex geometric patterns that are made out of love.
[00:57:23.216 --> 00:57:25.679]  It's some unbelievable experience.
[00:57:26.119 --> 00:57:27.760]  And your own brain makes this stuff.
[00:57:28.281 --> 00:57:32.705]  And they believe that your brain makes this stuff in mass quantities right before you die.
[00:57:33.105 --> 00:57:39.911]  So what you could be seeing when you do DMT, Heaven, the idea of Heaven, might be real.
[00:57:41.033 --> 00:57:43.296]  It might not be as simple as you die.
[00:57:43.617 --> 00:57:45.779]  It might be something far more complicated.
[00:57:56.393 --> 00:57:57.354]  Yeah, it was an old interview.
[00:57:57.374 --> 00:57:58.716]  That was a few years ago.
[00:57:59.136 --> 00:58:01.779]  It's not something that you do all the time, though.
[00:58:02.099 --> 00:58:08.105]  It's something that you do, and then you have to really think about what you learned when you were having that experience.
[00:58:08.426 --> 00:58:12.130]  Because otherwise, you're going to lose your context.
[00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:18.236]  The problem with psychedelics is if you do them too much, you lose your connection to this world.
[00:58:18.775 --> 00:58:24.499]  You lose your connection to people and life and our culture and our society and communication and friendship.
[00:58:24.799 --> 00:58:35.146]  You lose your connection because the other world is so crazy and so alien to this world that once you've been in it a few times, this world doesn't make any more sense.
[00:58:35.446 --> 00:58:36.086]  Stay there, Joe.
[00:58:36.106 --> 00:58:40.269]  I want to talk about how we're in one world while we're sleeping and another world while we're waking.
[00:58:40.629 --> 00:58:41.030]  Stay there.

[00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:08.230]  Stay there, Joe.

[00:59:22.852 --> 00:59:27.714]  It is a big idea.
[00:59:27.734 --> 00:59:29.855]  A new world order.
[00:59:30.555 --> 00:59:34.576]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:59:34.596 --> 00:59:38.278]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:59:38.298 --> 00:59:40.499]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:59:41.059 --> 00:59:43.460]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:44.236 --> 00:59:51.644]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:54.588 --> 00:59:59.553]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:00:00.074 --> 01:00:02.957]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order.
[01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:08.670]  Big Brother.
[01:00:09.351 --> 01:00:10.392]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:11.112 --> 01:00:12.213]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:12.873 --> 01:00:13.694]  You want answers?
[01:00:14.454 --> 01:00:15.355]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:15.375 --> 01:00:19.638]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.198 --> 01:00:24.301]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.442 --> 01:00:33.787]  Five minutes left with Joe Rogan by himself, and we've got to schedule Vincent Lugliosi, the prosecutor of the Mansett family.
[01:00:34.207 --> 01:00:36.789]  He's saying George Bush needs to be arrested and indicted for murder.
[01:00:38.174 --> 01:00:44.820]  So Joe will be riding a shotgun with us for that, and then another 30 minutes after Bill Legosi leaves us, we can get into a bunch of other issues.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.603]  Always love having Joe on with us, and we've certainly waited too long to have him back up.
[01:00:48.643 --> 01:00:49.484]  We appreciate him coming on.
[01:00:49.524 --> 01:00:50.484]  JoeRogan.net.
[01:00:50.865 --> 01:00:54.308]  My websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:54.328 --> 01:00:58.131]  We also have the viewers at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:58.691 --> 01:01:02.054]  And these are the type of great guests we bring you Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:01:02.074 --> 01:01:02.715]  to 3 p.m.
[01:01:03.095 --> 01:01:04.356]  Central Standard Time.
[01:01:05.277 --> 01:01:06.358]  Joe Rogan, you were talking about
[01:01:07.318 --> 01:01:14.183]  This chemical that's in the brain associated with dreaming, associated with spiritual experiences, DMT.
[01:01:15.063 --> 01:01:18.545]  And the last time I'd seen an interview with you talking about it, you've taken it a few times.
[01:01:18.585 --> 01:01:20.606]  You since say you've taken it more.
[01:01:21.827 --> 01:01:28.011]  And again, please continue about the sleeping world, you know, that reality, and then the waking world.
[01:01:28.891 --> 01:01:33.013]  Well, that is a lot of speculation about what happens to us when we sleep.
[01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:40.616]  What they believe is that DMT is produced at large levels during sleeping and during the moment before death.
[01:01:40.976 --> 01:01:49.780]  And one of the things about the DMT experience that's the most unsettling, or the strangest rather, is that when you pop over there, you feel like you've been there before.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.622]  Like, right away, you're like, oh man, I've been here.
[01:01:54.062 --> 01:01:56.063]  Like, instantly, you recognize it.
[01:01:56.856 --> 01:01:57.357]  I think so.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:14.840]  Yeah.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.881]  Well, that's what DMT is like.
[01:02:46.001 --> 01:02:46.822]  What's that term?
[01:02:47.102 --> 01:02:48.163]  I'm in a movie about it.
[01:02:48.204 --> 01:02:49.204]  You'd think I'd remember the name.
[01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:50.245]  It's not astronaut.
[01:02:50.285 --> 01:02:54.389]  It's about people that are into experiencing, remembering their dreams, controlling their dreams.
[01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:55.530]  Oh, lucid dreaming.
[01:02:55.851 --> 01:02:57.592]  Yeah, lucid dreaming, but there's a term.
[01:02:57.913 --> 01:02:59.754]  Argonauts or something knots?
[01:02:59.794 --> 01:03:00.395]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:03:00.635 --> 01:03:01.036]  I don't know.
[01:03:01.096 --> 01:03:04.299]  But there's people that believe that that is related to DMT.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:10.842]  The lucid dream and DMT is very closely related.
[01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:20.724]  Dr. Rick Strassman, he's a guy out of the University of New Mexico, is doing all these crazy studies to try to figure out what is real and what is not.
[01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:29.667]  He's got this whole Cottonwood Research Foundation that is dedicated to finding out what the levels of DMT are in a bunch of different human
[01:03:30.747 --> 01:03:30.827]  It's
[01:03:48.194 --> 01:03:50.035]  You know why people think that that's crazy?
[01:04:17.381 --> 01:04:19.322]  It's because people can't do that all the time.
[01:04:19.442 --> 01:04:21.782]  That's the only reason why people think that's crazy.
[01:04:22.202 --> 01:04:28.764]  If you stop and think about all the crazy things that people can do, how about just the fact that we can see out of our eyes?
[01:04:29.144 --> 01:04:36.526]  We look through these organs in our head, and we can make out objects, and we can read things, and... That's a crazy gift!
[01:04:36.786 --> 01:04:38.707]  Could you imagine if there were no eyes?
[01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:42.928]  Trying to describe the power of eyesight to someone if there were no eyes.
[01:04:43.285 --> 01:04:44.586]  It would be almost impossible.
[01:04:44.626 --> 01:04:46.828]  Wow, Joe, that's an amazing way to describe it.
[01:04:47.168 --> 01:04:47.828]  Lulling me away.
[01:04:47.848 --> 01:04:49.089]  That is how it could be.
[01:04:49.189 --> 01:04:52.532]  It could be that there's a bunch of different things that are possible.
[01:04:52.892 --> 01:04:57.035]  We just don't have the capability to do it, or we're evolving the capability of it.
[01:04:57.095 --> 01:04:58.836]  Human beings aren't done evolving.
[01:04:58.977 --> 01:05:00.197]  Joe Rogan's our guest.
[01:05:00.277 --> 01:05:00.698]  Stay with us.
[01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:05.251]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:05:05.531 --> 01:05:08.692]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty.
[01:05:09.012 --> 01:05:10.953]  Could you imagine if there were no eyes?
[01:05:11.373 --> 01:05:15.175]  Trying to describe the power of eyesight to someone, if there were no eyes.
[01:05:15.475 --> 01:05:16.835]  It would be almost impossible.
[01:05:16.895 --> 01:05:19.116]  Wow, Joe, that's an amazing way to describe it.
[01:05:19.737 --> 01:05:21.357]  That is how it could be.
[01:05:21.397 --> 01:05:24.719]  It could be that there's a bunch of different things that are possible.
[01:05:25.099 --> 01:05:29.260]  We just don't have the capability to do it, or we're evolving the capability of it.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.021]  Human beings aren't done evolving.
[01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:32.482]  Joe Rogan's our guest.
[01:05:32.502 --> 01:05:32.962]  Stay with us.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.441]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:05:37.741 --> 01:05:41.163]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:05:41.363 --> 01:05:43.184]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:05:43.824 --> 01:05:46.545]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:05:46.845 --> 01:05:52.328]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:05:52.588 --> 01:05:56.490]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:05:56.830 --> 01:06:01.734]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:06:02.014 --> 01:06:04.797]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[01:06:05.077 --> 01:06:11.923]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[01:06:12.283 --> 01:06:18.108]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[01:06:18.268 --> 01:06:22.792]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[01:06:23.132 --> 01:06:25.593]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[01:06:25.954 --> 01:06:27.595]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:06:27.995 --> 01:06:29.776]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[01:06:29.996 --> 01:06:31.797]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[01:06:32.117 --> 01:06:33.538]  Bring down the New World Order.
[01:06:33.898 --> 01:06:35.279]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:06:35.779 --> 01:06:37.740]  This is Steve Shank, J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:38.941]  Let's get real.
[01:06:39.361 --> 01:06:40.882]  Flour is already being rationed.
[01:06:41.082 --> 01:06:45.605]  Prices on food are getting so high, warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[01:06:46.285 --> 01:06:49.487]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food.
[01:06:50.177 --> 01:06:57.502]  We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford it, or there will be no food at any price.
[01:06:58.122 --> 01:07:01.424]  We can't grow enough of our own food, even with genetically altered trash.
[01:07:02.125 --> 01:07:05.147]  It will give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food.
[01:07:06.228 --> 01:07:09.570]  They think God didn't get it right, so Monsanto had to step in.
[01:07:10.422 --> 01:07:13.726]  If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay.
[01:07:14.267 --> 01:07:14.948]  We won't tell.
[01:07:15.508 --> 01:07:15.769]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:16.810]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:36.036 --> 01:07:40.318]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:07:40.558 --> 01:07:45.461]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:47.022]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:07:47.162 --> 01:07:50.564]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[01:07:50.784 --> 01:07:55.947]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[01:07:56.187 --> 01:08:01.950]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:03.936]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available.
[01:08:03.956 --> 01:08:05.942]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:06.524 --> 01:08:09.313]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.323 --> 01:08:29.660]  Okay, Joe Rogan, host of the Man Show, Comedy Central, host of Fear Factor, host of a new big show coming out on CBS, host of Ultimate Fighting Championships, top comedian, good friend of mine, he was on with us in the last hour, talking about electronic voting machines, government corruption, you name it.
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:33.323]  He'll be riding shotgun with us for the rest of this hour, but for the next 40 minutes or so,
[01:08:34.224 --> 01:08:37.106]  Vincent Bugliosi is our guest.
[01:08:37.126 --> 01:08:39.968]  He really doesn't need any introduction.
[01:08:39.988 --> 01:08:47.633]  Mr. Bugliosi was the individual who successfully prosecuted the Manson family and of course had a best-selling book there.
[01:08:48.633 --> 01:08:52.876]  Things he's written have been made into TV and movies and it goes on and on.
[01:08:53.156 --> 01:08:57.379]  His new book is The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder.
[01:08:57.879 --> 01:09:02.083]  Vincent Bugliosi, available at Amazon.com and everywhere else.
[01:09:02.624 --> 01:09:05.586]  And I tell you, we are really honored to have him on with us.
[01:09:05.626 --> 01:09:07.368]  And Joe Rogan, again, is going to be riding shotgun.
[01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:11.412]  And he's really politically active and been exposing what the administration's been doing.
[01:09:11.692 --> 01:09:13.394]  So he'll be chiming in as well.
[01:09:14.034 --> 01:09:15.676]  Mr. Bugliosi, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:09:16.121 --> 01:09:17.462]  Well, I'm happy to be on the show, Alex.
[01:09:18.082 --> 01:09:18.663]  I appreciate it.
[01:09:18.843 --> 01:09:19.323]  You bet!
[01:09:19.663 --> 01:09:23.105]  You are a very well-respected prosecutor and crime investigator.
[01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.927]  What made you write this book, and why should?
[01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:30.550]  What a provocative headline, titled, The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder.
[01:09:31.391 --> 01:09:31.951]  Tell us about it.
[01:09:32.812 --> 01:09:39.996]  Yeah, well, Alex, I don't like to see anyone get away with murder, much less over 100,000 murders.
[01:09:42.022 --> 01:09:53.470]  When you stop and think about the thousands upon thousands of deaths in Iraq and the horror and the screaming and the sea of blood and the incredible suffering there, it's unimaginable.
[01:09:54.451 --> 01:09:57.333]  And the question is, who's going to pay for all of this?
[01:09:57.533 --> 01:09:59.214]  Someone has to pay.
[01:09:59.415 --> 01:10:04.118]  And the person that has to pay, obviously, is the one that's responsible for all of this horror and death and suffering.
[01:10:04.959 --> 01:10:09.202]  And that person, the evidence shows, is George Bush.
[01:10:09.262 --> 01:10:11.003]  So far, he's gotten away with murder.
[01:10:11.929 --> 01:10:20.536]  This book, The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder, may put an end to it, may put him where he belongs, in an American courtroom, being tried for murder.
[01:10:21.296 --> 01:10:25.660]  This, obviously, is the most explosive book of my 30-year career.
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:26.921]  I've had three books cut up.
[01:10:26.941 --> 01:10:32.505]  The number one in the New York Times bestseller list, Outrage on the Simpson Case, Helter Skelter, and Amnesty will tell.
[01:10:33.326 --> 01:10:35.187]  This book is not my magnum opus.
[01:10:35.267 --> 01:10:39.631]  That's Reclaiming History, The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which is
[01:10:40.529 --> 01:10:46.372]  Presently being made by Tom Hanks and his people into a 10-hour miniseries for HBO, but this is the most explosive book.
[01:10:47.112 --> 01:10:48.393]  I'm dead serious about it.
[01:10:48.993 --> 01:11:03.040]  I've had 21 successful murder prosecutions, and at this stage in my life, you know, I'm 73, I wouldn't in a million years think of bringing a case against the President of the United States, unless I thought there was sufficient evidence
[01:11:03.951 --> 01:11:10.477]  And I was standing on very firm legal ground, and hopefully we'll be able to get into some of the evidence against Bush.
[01:11:10.538 --> 01:11:13.000]  Well, let me just throw this out, and I've ordered the book.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:13.841]  I haven't gotten it yet.
[01:11:13.861 --> 01:11:16.423]  I can't wait to read it, sir, and I really respect your opinion on this.
[01:11:17.084 --> 01:11:28.014]  My problem here is that we have the White House memos ordered by Bush to be written up by John Yoo, by, of course, now Attorney General, then Chief Counsel, Alberto Gonzalez.
[01:11:28.855 --> 01:11:37.418]  A former Attorney General saying they can torture children sexually with pliers, that they can torture someone to death, and that they didn't mean to kill them, it's okay.
[01:11:37.818 --> 01:11:39.839]  That right there, isn't that arrestable?
[01:11:39.859 --> 01:11:42.760]  I mean, isn't that Joseph Mingala-type stuff?
[01:11:43.542 --> 01:11:47.043]  Yeah, this book has nothing to do with torture.
[01:11:47.063 --> 01:12:01.488]  When you talk about mass torture, you're talking about the International Criminal Court at The Hague, and they wouldn't even have jurisdiction to go after Bush for this, because the United States was not a signatory nation to the agreement establishing the ICC.
[01:12:03.769 --> 01:12:08.671]  It's not completely clear that Bush is complicit in this torture thing.
[01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:11.652]  He issued an executive order
[01:12:12.199 --> 01:12:19.862]  In February of 2002, mandating that all detainees are treated humanely, but this book has nothing to do with torture.
[01:12:19.882 --> 01:12:23.924]  It has something to do with murder, specifically the 4,000 U.S.
[01:12:24.344 --> 01:12:27.685]  soldiers who died in Iraq fighting Bush's war.
[01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:33.608]  There's kind of an echo, Alex, when I'm talking, if you can tell your radio guy to take the echo out.
[01:12:34.244 --> 01:12:35.645]  Okay, we're not getting that on air, sir.
[01:12:35.665 --> 01:12:36.485]  I apologize.
[01:12:37.385 --> 01:12:43.448]  Before we get into the evidence, I just want to introduce Joe Rogan to you.
[01:12:45.049 --> 01:12:47.730]  Joe, what do you think of the idea of this book?
[01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:55.554]  I mean, that's a stunning title by somebody of the caliber of Vincente Bugliosi, the prosecution of George W. Bush for murder.
[01:12:56.716 --> 01:12:57.977]  Here's my question.
[01:12:57.997 --> 01:13:05.061]  Do you really think that it is possible that after he's out of office that he could be brought into court and tried for something like this?
[01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:07.282]  Do you really believe that that's possible?
[01:13:07.402 --> 01:13:10.204]  Or will Hillary or McCain or Barack Obama pardon him?
[01:13:10.864 --> 01:13:14.446]  If you're talking about the law, Joe, there's still that echo there.
[01:13:14.586 --> 01:13:19.089]  If you're talking about the law, Jesus, the echo's getting worse and worse.
[01:13:19.369 --> 01:13:21.951]  So tell the guy to do something to take away this echo.
[01:13:23.091 --> 01:13:23.371]  Joe,
[01:13:25.194 --> 01:13:32.836]  If you're talking about the law, the evidence is very, very clear that he can be prosecuted for murder once he leaves office.
[01:13:33.236 --> 01:13:35.237]  Look, I'll give you a classic example.
[01:13:35.457 --> 01:13:46.819]  In 1974, when Nixon resigned, you're well aware that there was a movement to prosecute him criminally for crimes he committed while he was in office.
[01:13:46.959 --> 01:13:49.080]  And, of course, Gerald Ford
[01:13:50.231 --> 01:13:52.413]  Every word I say is echoing back to me.
[01:13:52.593 --> 01:13:53.634]  Tell you what we're going to do, sir.
[01:13:53.894 --> 01:13:58.978]  We're going to give your number right now to my Texas studio, and we'll have you put on this line.
[01:13:59.919 --> 01:14:03.682]  Sir, since we can't fix it, that never happens, unless we've got a big guest.
[01:14:03.922 --> 01:14:04.803]  It's very unusual.
[01:14:05.303 --> 01:14:11.909]  And John, I am the number down here to Texas, and we'll get Mr. Bugliosi on right now via a Texas line.
[01:14:12.369 --> 01:14:13.310]  How does that sound, sir?
[01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:16.953]  Well, I'm still hearing the echo.
[01:14:17.413 --> 01:14:19.234]  No, I'm saying we're going to call you back on another line.
[01:14:19.935 --> 01:14:21.257]  We're gonna call you back on another line, okay?
[01:14:21.277 --> 01:14:21.777]  Okay, I'll hang up.
[01:14:22.018 --> 01:14:22.398]  I'll hang up.
[01:14:22.478 --> 01:14:24.581]  Okay, yeah, they got Tinker Toys up there at the network.
[01:14:24.601 --> 01:14:27.464]  So what do you mean by this usually happens when you have a big guest?
[01:14:27.484 --> 01:14:29.306]  Do you think this is like the government, man?
[01:14:29.366 --> 01:14:30.307]  No, I don't think so.
[01:14:30.427 --> 01:14:31.509]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:14:31.949 --> 01:14:33.411]  Happens probably five, six times a year.
[01:14:33.992 --> 01:14:34.292]  I had...
[01:14:36.314 --> 01:14:50.711]  Last week I had Jesse Ventura back on for a second time, and for five minutes the phone company over on ISDN line, where it's supposedly impossible, we have a recording of it, was saying hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, in my ear, over the end here.
[01:14:50.751 --> 01:14:55.116]  They couldn't hear it on the network end, it was only on one half the ISDN line, but we got it recorded here.
[01:14:55.376 --> 01:14:55.876]  So I don't know.
[01:14:55.936 --> 01:14:56.837]  No, it's Murphy's Law.
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:58.180]  Huh.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.081]  I mean, I guess you only have a blowout when you're on a mountain road by a cliff where it'll kill you.
[01:15:02.402 --> 01:15:04.902]  But you won't have one going down a pretty sunny lane.
[01:15:05.342 --> 01:15:06.483]  I mean, hell, I don't know, man.
[01:15:07.023 --> 01:15:08.804]  I just know it completely drives me up the wall.
[01:15:09.324 --> 01:15:10.844]  It's amazing that this works at all.
[01:15:11.364 --> 01:15:15.766]  I mean, it's amazing that I'm on a cordless phone talking to you and you're streaming it live over the internet.
[01:15:15.806 --> 01:15:16.526]  How crazy is that?
[01:15:16.546 --> 01:15:20.327]  It goes on radio, it's in the air, people pick it up in their cars when they're driving.
[01:15:20.727 --> 01:15:21.187]  That's nuts.
[01:15:21.708 --> 01:15:22.868]  I mean, almost in real time.
[01:15:23.803 --> 01:15:25.985]  Yeah, the network also has like $5 boards.
[01:15:26.485 --> 01:15:28.447]  Specials Ted got at a garage sale or something.
[01:15:28.707 --> 01:15:30.228]  I think from East German origin.
[01:15:30.548 --> 01:15:31.149]  I'm joking.
[01:15:31.649 --> 01:15:32.189]  I'm joking.
[01:15:32.249 --> 01:15:33.370]  It just drives me up the wall.
[01:15:34.511 --> 01:15:40.916]  But... I guess people who are listening are saying that they're hearing an echo on my message board.
[01:15:40.976 --> 01:15:42.417]  People keep saying, fix the echo.
[01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:43.078]  There's an echo.
[01:15:44.959 --> 01:15:45.239]  Really?
[01:15:45.439 --> 01:15:46.240]  I'm not hearing that.
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:48.842]  I don't hear it either, but I'm just, you know, on a phone.
[01:15:51.095 --> 01:15:54.137]  Yeah, well we've got actually the radio feed off a local radio station out there.
[01:15:54.157 --> 01:15:54.838]  It's not echoing.
[01:15:55.458 --> 01:15:56.799]  God only knows what's going on.
[01:15:56.839 --> 01:15:58.341]  Who knows anymore, Joe?
[01:15:58.821 --> 01:15:59.682]  God only knows.
[01:16:00.182 --> 01:16:06.166]  Getting back to what you were saying earlier, this is a pretty bold book for this guy to write.
[01:16:06.587 --> 01:16:07.948]  I mean, to come out and say this.
[01:16:08.388 --> 01:16:09.689]  It sounds like a really bold book.
[01:16:09.909 --> 01:16:22.977]  I mean, I think a lot of people write books saying that, you know, that they think that, you know, he should be... I mean, a lot of people could write books saying that they think that he should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity or war crimes.
[01:16:23.397 --> 01:16:25.779]  But is that possible that he could be brought in?
[01:16:25.859 --> 01:16:29.841]  I mean, I know a lot of people share the belief, but is it physically possible?
[01:16:29.901 --> 01:16:32.863]  Could you ever imagine a president going to jail
[01:16:33.648 --> 01:16:41.592]  Or at least going to court and being brought up on charges of his actions causing the unlawful death of other humans.
[01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:43.733]  Could you see that being possible?
[01:16:43.953 --> 01:16:53.658]  We'd have to become so enlightened as a culture, we'd have to move so far beyond where we are now to actually bring this guy in front of a jury?
[01:16:53.678 --> 01:16:55.379]  Is that possible?
[01:16:55.956 --> 01:16:58.117]  Well, we need to reclaim the name of this country.
[01:16:58.157 --> 01:17:00.298]  We have a really bad name worldwide now, Joe.
[01:17:00.838 --> 01:17:01.458]  Oh, for sure.
[01:17:01.518 --> 01:17:04.780]  We had a great name when 9-11 happened.
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:10.222]  We had all these people all over the world that felt sorry.
[01:17:10.502 --> 01:17:16.185]  Even in France, there was something in the paper that said something about, today we're all American.
[01:17:16.892 --> 01:17:30.003]  I mean, that's a pretty amazing thought, that, you know, this horrible tragedy linked all these human beings together and we all felt sympathy for each other, and that somehow or another over the past seven years, that sympathy has been completely eroded.
[01:17:30.403 --> 01:17:31.004]  Completely.
[01:17:31.084 --> 01:17:32.785]  Let's go back to the opposite.
[01:17:32.805 --> 01:17:33.226]  Well, I agree.
[01:17:33.246 --> 01:17:38.490]  Let's go back to Vincente Migliosi, who's got the new book out, The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder.
[01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:40.012]  Is the echo gone now, sir?
[01:17:40.212 --> 01:17:42.634]  No, it's okay now, and I appreciate it.
[01:17:45.067 --> 01:17:47.349]  The law is very, very, very clear.
[01:17:47.409 --> 01:17:58.058]  It goes back to the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton, 1787, that once a president leaves office, he can be prosecuted for any crime he committed while he was in office.
[01:17:58.078 --> 01:17:59.239]  And I was talking about Nixon.
[01:18:00.059 --> 01:18:07.626]  There was a movement, a strong movement in America, after he resigned, to prosecute him for crimes like obstruction of justice and wiretapping and subordination to perjury.
[01:18:08.464 --> 01:18:15.926]  That was all obviated when President Ford granted him a pardon, so there's no question that he has no immunity from prosecution.
[01:18:15.966 --> 01:18:21.427]  Now, on the other question of the likelihood of this happening, I'll be candid with you.
[01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:36.031]  I do not believe there's a high probability of this, but I definitely believe there's a substantial possibility that George Bush will, in fact, be prosecuted for murder as a direct result of this book, and the main reason I say this
[01:18:37.210 --> 01:19:02.795]  is because of the great number of prosecutors in america i've established jurisdiction for in my book i've spent well over a hundred hours in the law library working on this uh... jurisdiction issue he can be prosecuted for the crimes of murder and conspiracy to commit murder under both federal and state law federally the prosecutor would only be the uh... u s attorney general in washington dc acting through his department justice but on a state level on a state level
[01:19:03.689 --> 01:19:23.518]  I've established jurisdiction for the Attorney General in each of the 50 states, plus the hundreds upon hundreds of district attorneys in counties within these states, to prosecute Bush for the murder of any soldier or soldiers from their state or county who died in Iraq fighting Bush's war.
[01:19:24.079 --> 01:19:29.001]  With all of these prosecutors, it could number close to a thousand prosecutors.
[01:19:29.611 --> 01:19:50.542]  And with all of the very powerful evidence of Bush's guilt that I present in my book, it's not unreasonable to believe, Alex, that at least one prosecutor in America, maybe many more, will be courageous enough to say, hey, this is the United States of America, no man is above the law, the evidence of George Bush's guilt is clear, so I'm going to go after him and bring about justice for the American people.
[01:19:52.258 --> 01:19:52.979]  Stay there, sir.
[01:19:53.099 --> 01:19:54.382]  Joe Rogan, stay there as well.

[01:24:41.157 --> 01:24:41.597]  Tell us why.
[01:24:41.937 --> 01:24:59.408]  Okay, without getting into the legal complexities of malice aforethought and vicarious liability, which would be very dry and arcane, I can tell you that if Bush were prosecuted for murder, the central overriding question would be, did he take this nation to war in self-defense?
[01:24:59.488 --> 01:25:02.670]  If so, it's called justifiable homicide.
[01:25:03.170 --> 01:25:09.174]  He claims that he took the nation to war in self-defense, his so-called preemptive strike.
[01:25:09.798 --> 01:25:23.307]  If it came out at the trial, however, that he did not take the nation to war in self-defense, but he took the nation to war under false pretenses, then all of the killings in Iraq of American soldiers would be unlawful killings.
[01:25:23.487 --> 01:25:25.628]  And being unlawful killings, it would be murder.
[01:25:25.968 --> 01:25:27.849]  Let me just talk to you about some of the evidence.
[01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:29.250]  If we have time, we can get into more.
[01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:32.412]  But I think what I'm going to be telling you is going to be astonishing to you.
[01:25:32.432 --> 01:25:34.834]  It'll take a little time, but let me explain it to you.
[01:25:35.825 --> 01:25:58.674]  In George Bush's first speech to the nation, Alex, on Hussein in Iraq, October 7, 2002, Cincinnati, Ohio, he told Americans that Hussein was a great danger to America, either by Hussein attacking us with weapons of mass destruction or giving these weapons to some terrorist group to do so.
[01:25:58.894 --> 01:26:05.036]  And he said that this attack could happen, quote, on any given day, unquote, meaning that the threat
[01:26:05.898 --> 01:26:06.459]  ...was imminent.
[01:26:07.259 --> 01:26:32.075]  The only big problem for George Bush, and I don't know how he would get around this at the trial, is that on October the 1st, 2002, six days earlier, the CIA sent George Bush its 2002 National Intelligence Estimate, a top-secret, classified report representing the consensus opinion of all 16 U.S.
[01:26:32.135 --> 01:26:33.316]  intelligence agencies
[01:26:34.036 --> 01:26:37.737]  On the issue of whether Hussein was an imminent threat to the security of this country.
[01:26:38.798 --> 01:26:53.703]  And on page 8 of that report, it clearly and unequivocally says, and what I'm about to tell you, to my knowledge, to my knowledge, has never appeared before in any American newspaper, any major American paper or magazine.
[01:26:54.003 --> 01:27:00.986]  Page 8 clearly says Hussein was not an imminent threat to the security of this country,
[01:27:01.553 --> 01:27:05.975]  He would only be a threat if he feared that America was about to attack him.
[01:27:06.015 --> 01:27:10.096]  In other words, he would only be a threat if he was forced to fight in self-defense.
[01:27:11.136 --> 01:27:14.217]  Now, what we have here is this.
[01:27:14.497 --> 01:27:28.182]  We know then, we're not thinking, we know that when Bush told the nation on the evening of October 7, 2002 that Hussein was an imminent threat to the security of this country, he was telling millions of unsuspecting Americans
[01:27:28.823 --> 01:27:32.764]  The exact opposite of what his own CIA was telling him.
[01:27:33.305 --> 01:27:42.388]  I can tell you, Alex, that even if we had nothing else at all, and there's so much more, this alone shows that Bush took this nation to war on a lie.
[01:27:43.095 --> 01:27:47.739]  And therefore, all the killings of American soldiers in Iraq were unlawful killings and murders.
[01:27:47.759 --> 01:27:48.880]  But there's a key point there, sir.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:52.163]  I'd like you to elaborate on this and get Joe's comment, and we'll come back and get into more details.
[01:27:52.183 --> 01:27:53.323]  We have plenty of time if you've got it.
[01:27:54.004 --> 01:28:10.578]  That is, not only was there not a threat if they didn't attack, so he lied and created a false threat, but then by going in, he did create a threat in case Saddam had nerve gas or something, and so not only did he lie, but then he did put the United States in a threat.
[01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:11.839]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:28:12.319 --> 01:28:15.921]  Now, with respect to this national intelligence estimate, it gets worse, Alex.
[01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:16.641]  It gets worse.
[01:28:17.382 --> 01:28:38.313]  On October the 4th, just three days after the October 1st, 2002 classified report, Bush and his people had the CIA issue an unclassified summary version of the October 1st classified report so this could be released to the American people and Congress.
[01:28:39.011 --> 01:28:50.946]  This unclassified version became known as the White Paper, and in this White Paper that was shown to Congress and the American people, the conclusion of 16 U.S.
[01:28:50.986 --> 01:28:57.675]  intelligence agencies that Iraq was not an imminent threat to the security of this country was completely deleted.
[01:28:58.206 --> 01:29:04.330]  From that white paper that was shown to the American people, every single one of those all-important words were taken out.
[01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:06.192]  So then they falsified evidence.
[01:29:06.672 --> 01:29:08.053]  Well, there's no question.
[01:29:08.073 --> 01:29:09.474]  I mean, I've got the goods on them.
[01:29:09.514 --> 01:29:13.857]  I mean, I'm not about, at this stage in my career, to bring a false case against George Bush.
[01:29:13.917 --> 01:29:17.920]  Mr. Bugliosi, you talk about them being murderers, and they certainly are.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.501]  Aren't you worried about them coming after you?
[01:29:20.273 --> 01:29:22.616]  Well, that's something I'd rather not talk about.
[01:29:22.636 --> 01:29:24.679]  I don't want to put the thoughts in people's minds.
[01:29:24.819 --> 01:29:32.409]  I've had death threats throughout the years in various cases that I've prosecuted for murder, but some people are concerned because
[01:29:33.553 --> 01:29:42.325]  What it is, is the right wing in this country, and I'm a moderate, but the right wing has terrified this country, and people are afraid to take on the right wing.
[01:29:42.345 --> 01:29:43.988]  The right wing is not afraid of the left wing.
[01:29:44.028 --> 01:29:45.970]  The left wing is terrified of the right wing.
[01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:48.174]  Mr. Bugliosi, we're going to break, but I'm going to go ahead and skip this break.
[01:29:48.194 --> 01:29:49.896]  We're going to keep talking to you right now.
[01:29:49.996 --> 01:29:50.357]  Stay there.
[01:29:53.587 --> 01:29:55.988]  Mr. Bugliosi, we're continuing on air right now.
[01:29:56.728 --> 01:30:02.530]  I want to come back to the main audience and get more into the oven, but this is key points you're raising, and I'm aware of those points, and you're right.
[01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:05.811]  The mainstream media has never really put two and two together for people.
[01:30:06.091 --> 01:30:08.412]  Joe Rogan comments to Mr. Bugliosi.
[01:30:10.105 --> 01:30:11.466]  It's all pretty shocking stuff.
[01:30:13.447 --> 01:30:20.251]  How many people had to know that the CIA had completely different advice about going to war for Mr. Bush?
[01:30:20.291 --> 01:30:23.752]  How many people are involved in this?
[01:30:24.013 --> 01:30:24.873]  Are we live here?
[01:30:25.133 --> 01:30:26.934]  Yes, sir, we are.
[01:30:27.454 --> 01:30:28.195]  How many people know?
[01:30:28.215 --> 01:30:29.235]  There's no way for me to know that.
[01:30:29.275 --> 01:30:30.656]  The Bush administration knew it.
[01:30:31.096 --> 01:30:35.138]  The Bush administration knew it, and of course the CIA knew it, and all 16 U.S.
[01:30:35.458 --> 01:30:36.339]  intelligence agencies.
[01:30:36.894 --> 01:30:44.220]  To my knowledge, as I say, to my knowledge, this has never appeared before in any major paper or magazine in America.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.461]  But how many people knew about it?
[01:30:45.862 --> 01:30:49.765]  The Bush administration knew about it, the CIA and the other 16 intelligence agencies.
[01:30:49.825 --> 01:30:50.846]  I don't know how well they knew about it.
[01:30:50.866 --> 01:30:55.070]  And they just assumed that no one else would ever find out about it, or they just assumed that they were...
[01:30:55.875 --> 01:30:58.216]  That it was impossible to prosecute them?
[01:30:58.536 --> 01:31:04.657]  I cannot answer that question, but you gotta know that these people have enormous stratospheric arrogance.
[01:31:04.737 --> 01:31:08.298]  They also know that the so-called liberal media is extremely weak.
[01:31:09.198 --> 01:31:17.681]  Right now, as I'm talking to you, this book, it just came out, is literally being blacklisted by the American media.
[01:31:17.741 --> 01:31:21.221]  As soon as they find out what the title is, they literally shrink.
[01:31:21.782 --> 01:31:23.102]  I had a difficult time
[01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:25.270]  Getting this book published.
[01:31:25.591 --> 01:31:27.372]  And you know, I'm someone who's had three books.
[01:31:27.492 --> 01:31:29.274]  Number one, New York Times.
[01:31:30.375 --> 01:31:32.457]  They were all excited that I was doing this book.
[01:31:32.617 --> 01:31:37.321]  And when they found out what it was about, I had a very difficult time getting it published.
[01:31:37.381 --> 01:31:38.542]  I finally got it published.
[01:31:38.883 --> 01:31:42.846]  The audio for the book, I've always had audio for a book.
[01:31:43.146 --> 01:31:46.469]  No American audio company would do it.
[01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:49.192]  We got the British broadcasting company to do it.
[01:31:51.989 --> 01:31:57.853]  There's a companion documentary for the big screen that's in progress right now based on my book.
[01:31:58.213 --> 01:32:00.775]  They couldn't raise one dime in America.
[01:32:00.795 --> 01:32:03.057]  A Canadian investor had to come through.
[01:32:03.618 --> 01:32:08.843]  We're supposed to be the land of the brave, what do they call it, the land of the free, the home of the brave?
[01:32:08.983 --> 01:32:12.687]  Not that way anymore in America.
[01:32:13.007 --> 01:32:18.593]  This is 100% because people are avoiding it because they're scared, not because there's anyone out there that's disputing your evidence.
[01:32:18.773 --> 01:32:22.056]  No, no, no, you can't dispute it.
[01:32:22.757 --> 01:32:24.137]  Let me talk about another piece of evidence.
[01:32:24.157 --> 01:32:26.698]  Well let me stop you Mr. Bugliosi because let me explain what's happening.
[01:32:26.878 --> 01:32:31.460]  This is a large show and I'm sorry that you had some technical stuff earlier just so you understand.
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:37.922]  It's also TV right now and so during the breaks and in the aggregate millions see this as well.
[01:32:38.402 --> 01:32:43.067]  We continue as an internet show during the breaks when we're strapped for time.
[01:32:43.327 --> 01:32:54.317]  The main audience with all the Eminem affiliates is coming back in 20 seconds, so you should recap that they're blackballing the book and then get into more of the evidence with people because I think that's a key point to make.
[01:32:54.337 --> 01:32:59.262]  So we're going to go back live on the main transmission with you and, of course, Joe Rogan.
[01:32:59.502 --> 01:32:59.922]  Stay with us.
[01:32:59.942 --> 01:33:00.223]  Here we go.
[01:33:08.541 --> 01:33:20.192]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and folks listening on the internet, we were just talking to Vincent Bugliosi and he was bringing up the fact that he was at all these best-selling books and books made into movies he could not get.
[01:33:21.698 --> 01:33:22.098]  A U.S.
[01:33:22.138 --> 01:33:23.579]  company to do the audiobook.
[01:33:23.779 --> 01:33:26.541]  He couldn't raise money when he always can to make this into a film.
[01:33:27.782 --> 01:33:30.584]  He had a lot of trouble getting a U.S.
[01:33:30.664 --> 01:33:31.124]  publisher.
[01:33:31.164 --> 01:33:32.105]  They are very scared of this.
[01:33:32.645 --> 01:33:33.386]  And I understand why.
[01:33:33.426 --> 01:33:35.507]  The prosecution of George W. Bush for murder.
[01:33:36.127 --> 01:33:38.369]  And sir, you've never had trouble getting in the media before.
[01:33:38.849 --> 01:33:44.553]  You were telling me during the break, and you elaborate, that the mainstream media isn't touching this with a 10-foot pole.
[01:33:44.793 --> 01:33:45.854]  They're just terrified!
[01:33:45.874 --> 01:33:46.714]  Absolutely terrified!
[01:33:46.734 --> 01:33:59.480]  I mean, I used to start out all my books on Good Morning America, the Today Show, I've been on TV hundreds of times, but when they hear this title, the prosecution of George W. Bush for murder, they say, well, you know, we can't get into that.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:04.182]  Publishers would say to me, Mr. Bugliosi, are you sure you want to publish this book?
[01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:07.744]  And one put it in black and white, too hot to handle.
[01:34:08.184 --> 01:34:11.706]  They're terrified of the right wing in this country.
[01:34:12.253 --> 01:34:13.533]  They're terrified of these people.
[01:34:13.553 --> 01:34:15.774]  They're terrified of the Rush Limbaugh's of the world.
[01:34:16.154 --> 01:34:32.318]  I'm telling you that a shadow of fear has descended on this country and even though the publishers were very sympathetic with what I was saying and recognized the tremendous marketability of this thing, their fear trumped money.
[01:34:32.378 --> 01:34:33.479]  But I'm going to get it out there.
[01:34:33.539 --> 01:34:37.940]  I'm going to get it out there and the documentary people under my direction
[01:34:39.103 --> 01:34:46.206]  Are going to start reaching out very soon to the prosecutors of America to find a courageous American prosecutor to go against this guy George Bush.
[01:34:46.226 --> 01:34:47.347]  He's gotten away with murder.
[01:34:47.907 --> 01:34:49.187]  No one has done anything about it.
[01:34:49.367 --> 01:34:51.148]  No one now wants to even talk about it.
[01:34:51.188 --> 01:34:52.529]  That's why I'm happy to be on your show.
[01:34:53.209 --> 01:34:55.670]  But the mainstream media is terrified.
[01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:57.931]  They do not want to touch this book at all.
[01:35:00.103 --> 01:35:11.251]  Joe Rogan had brought up earlier, when we were getting you back on the line, Mr. Bibliosi, that this has destroyed our name, this fraudulent war, these hundreds of thousands of dead, that we have to do something.
[01:35:12.092 --> 01:35:16.475]  We have to at least speak out against it, because if we don't, it's all being done in our name.
[01:35:16.495 --> 01:35:17.836]  And you talk about 100,000 dead.
[01:35:18.116 --> 01:35:21.699]  The Lancet study and one other now have been confirmed over 600,000 dead.
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:23.781]  Absolutely.
[01:35:24.041 --> 01:35:27.163]  In fact, there's one poll that shows, one survey showed over a million.
[01:35:27.243 --> 01:35:30.986]  I'm being very, very conservative when I say over 100,000.
[01:35:31.166 --> 01:35:34.188]  Very, very conservative.
[01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:35.489]  Mr. Guglielmi?
[01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:36.070]  Yes?
[01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:40.113]  Are you aware of the man who wrote that book, Fortunate Son?
[01:35:40.828 --> 01:35:41.228]  J.H.
[01:35:41.269 --> 01:35:41.889]  Hatfield?
[01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:43.050]  No, what does that hold?
[01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.652]  He was murdered and put in a bathtub.
[01:35:45.733 --> 01:35:47.955]  I know you don't want to add to this, and I understand that.
[01:35:48.235 --> 01:35:53.600]  I don't talk about the death threats I get, but it's one thing to get a threat from the Manson Cooks.
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.162]  It's another thing to be going up against the new Adolf Hitler.
[01:35:56.422 --> 01:35:56.883]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:35:57.203 --> 01:35:58.765]  I feel that I don't have any choice.
[01:35:59.205 --> 01:36:01.587]  People say how courageous and brave I am.
[01:36:02.328 --> 01:36:03.869]  I'm not a brave, courageous person.
[01:36:03.969 --> 01:36:04.590]  It's anger.
[01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:27.516]  Every time I see George Bush with a big smile on his face, and I know that young American soldiers who never even had a chance to live out their dream are being blown to pieces by roadside bombs in Iraq, and this guy here, and the evidence is overwhelming, in my book, I have a whole chapter on it, this guy here, while all this horror was taking place, had fun
[01:36:28.191 --> 01:36:30.513]  Had fun and lived life to the fullest.
[01:36:31.073 --> 01:36:35.276]  I'm talking about running, bicycling, joking with friends, laughing back.
[01:36:35.296 --> 01:36:36.497]  No, no, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[01:36:36.517 --> 01:36:38.338]  And I mean, Joe's going to throw something in, but I totally agree.
[01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:40.980]  He lied and said he hadn't played golf since the war started.
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:44.723]  Then mainstream news admitted hundreds of times videoed playing golf.
[01:36:44.803 --> 01:36:46.244]  It's just constant lying.
[01:36:46.744 --> 01:36:47.105]  Yeah.
[01:36:47.145 --> 01:36:48.606]  They admit he takes a two-hour nap.
[01:36:48.626 --> 01:36:50.927]  He exercises for three hours a day.
[01:36:51.027 --> 01:36:51.928]  None of us can do that.
[01:36:52.148 --> 01:36:56.131]  I mean, this guy lives the life of some type of little tart or something.
[01:36:56.191 --> 01:36:57.072]  Joe, you were going to say something?
[01:37:00.929 --> 01:37:02.590]  First of all, I saw the thing about golfing.
[01:37:02.610 --> 01:37:05.571]  That was pretty shocking, that he would lie about that.
[01:37:05.611 --> 01:37:12.535]  I mean, he must know so little about this age of information, how quickly they can research something like that.
[01:37:13.575 --> 01:37:17.657]  He's in Crawford, Texas in 2005, August 13th.
[01:37:17.697 --> 01:37:21.699]  He's bicycling and telling reporters this is a slice of heaven.
[01:37:21.719 --> 01:37:23.620]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:37:24.355 --> 01:37:27.437]  This guy has enjoyed himself throughout this whole war.
[01:37:27.477 --> 01:37:28.738]  You don't have to take my word for it.
[01:37:28.898 --> 01:37:37.364]  Bush himself has told people how much he's enjoyed life throughout the entire period of this war.
[01:37:37.624 --> 01:37:38.785]  Let me give you a couple quotes.
[01:37:39.065 --> 01:37:39.605]  Well, hold on.
[01:37:39.645 --> 01:37:40.506]  What about his mother?
[01:37:41.066 --> 01:37:42.547]  She's asking about all the dead.
[01:37:42.648 --> 01:37:44.109]  Yeah, that sweet, sensitive mother.
[01:37:44.769 --> 01:37:47.911]  Well, she said, why should I care about body bags and dead troops?
[01:37:47.971 --> 01:37:50.773]  Why should I think about that with my beautiful mind?
[01:37:50.853 --> 01:37:52.314]  Of course, yeah.
[01:37:52.514 --> 01:37:53.255]  That's all in my book.
[01:37:53.843 --> 01:38:05.868]  I'm going to give you some quotes from this guy, and while I give you these quotes, I want you to try to imagine in your wildest imagination Roosevelt and Truman and LBJ and Nixon during their respective wars saying things like this.
[01:38:06.428 --> 01:38:07.769]  This is George Bush.
[01:38:08.989 --> 01:38:19.654]  Right in the middle of this hellish conflict that he created in Iraq with young kids coming home in an aluminum box, and the parents are told, don't open it up because the contents are unviewable.
[01:38:19.794 --> 01:38:20.634]  Here's George Bush.
[01:38:21.465 --> 01:38:25.267]  Laura and I are having the time of our life.
[01:38:26.187 --> 01:38:27.668]  I'm in a great mood.
[01:38:27.988 --> 01:38:29.689]  It's going to be a perfect day.
[01:38:29.909 --> 01:38:31.590]  I'm feeling pretty good about life.
[01:38:32.131 --> 01:38:35.432]  This guy has enjoyed himself throughout the whole period of this war.
[01:38:35.452 --> 01:38:36.653]  He's unbelievable.
[01:38:37.053 --> 01:38:50.380]  He hears reports that eight American soldiers are blown to pieces by roadside bombs in Iraq, and the very next day he's on a street stage in Tbilisi, Russia, swiveling his hips like Elvis to blaring
[01:38:51.048 --> 01:38:51.849]  Uh, folk music.
[01:38:52.310 --> 01:39:05.283]  He has not suffered one day, and I want to put a thought in his mind that he's going to take with him to his grave, that someone may tap him on the shoulder after he leaves office and say, Mr. President, there's some prosecutor up in Fargo, North Dakota.
[01:39:05.603 --> 01:39:08.646]  We're due up there Wednesday morning, 9 o'clock.
[01:39:08.867 --> 01:39:10.108]  He's charging you with murder.
[01:39:10.148 --> 01:39:11.850]  There's no statute of limitations for murder.
[01:39:12.430 --> 01:39:18.071]  And there's hundreds of prosecutors out there that could bring this action against him, and I want to bring this guy to justice.
[01:39:18.091 --> 01:39:22.292]  Well, remember Clinton, that grand jury made him testify.
[01:39:22.312 --> 01:39:24.352]  Sure, go ahead, Joe.
[01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:34.735]  For the legally ignorant like myself, so any prosecutor from any state can bring up these charges against the former president.
[01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:41.916]  I've established that, yes, as long as a soldier from their state or county died fighting George Bush's war.
[01:39:43.069 --> 01:39:45.090]  It gets into the issue of overt acts.
[01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:47.230]  And that shows cause.
[01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:52.371]  That shows cause and shows you've been hurt, showing the corpse, right?
[01:39:52.431 --> 01:39:54.211]  It's showing how you were individually hurt.
[01:39:54.892 --> 01:39:58.392]  Well, here's what it is, and we're getting into detail here.
[01:39:59.212 --> 01:40:02.953]  He can be prosecuted for two crimes, murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
[01:40:03.873 --> 01:40:09.935]  The heart of conspiracy to commit murder is an agreement, and obviously there was an agreement back here to take this nation to war.
[01:40:10.275 --> 01:40:11.675]  That's back in Washington, D.C.
[01:40:11.755 --> 01:40:12.115]  However,
[01:40:12.714 --> 01:40:14.855]  The agreement is not enough to make a conspiracy.
[01:40:14.895 --> 01:40:19.998]  There's got to be an overt act committed to further the object of the conspiracy.
[01:40:20.058 --> 01:40:21.198]  Then they put out fake data.
[01:40:21.578 --> 01:40:21.858]  Pardon?
[01:40:22.059 --> 01:40:23.099]  Then they put out fake data.
[01:40:23.119 --> 01:40:23.539]  That's that.
[01:40:23.739 --> 01:40:24.019]  Okay.
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:31.143]  The two overt acts here that were committed in all 50 states is the lies that George Bush told in Washington, D.C., Cincinnati,
[01:40:31.710 --> 01:40:37.056]  That by way of radio and television went into the homes and cars of every state of this union.
[01:40:37.096 --> 01:40:37.917]  That's an overt act.
[01:40:37.937 --> 01:40:43.743]  The other overt act is recruiting soldiers from the 50 states to fight his bogus war.
[01:40:44.504 --> 01:40:51.251]  Once an overt act has been committed in a state, that state has jurisdiction to prosecute for the conspiracy to commit murder.
[01:40:51.741 --> 01:40:53.663]  Even if the agreement is in some other state.
[01:40:53.703 --> 01:40:54.843]  The law is very clear on this.
[01:40:54.903 --> 01:40:56.345]  I've done my homework.
[01:40:56.785 --> 01:40:59.187]  I go to court, and I'm prepared.
[01:40:59.467 --> 01:41:00.588]  So they have jurisdiction.
[01:41:00.628 --> 01:41:11.896]  Now once they have jurisdiction for the conspiracy to commit murder, then all murders that were committed pursuant to that conspiracy, the state also has jurisdiction to prosecute for those murders.
[01:41:12.236 --> 01:41:13.277]  I want to get into another one.
[01:41:13.357 --> 01:41:14.298]  Individual acts.
[01:41:14.978 --> 01:41:21.183]  Meaning that if he's exonerated for any one of them by the future president, if the future president decides to absolve him,
[01:41:21.795 --> 01:41:26.816]  He still, I mean, there's hundreds of thousands of individual cases you could try him on.
[01:41:26.956 --> 01:41:28.477]  No, no, no.
[01:41:30.637 --> 01:41:33.938]  If the succeeding president were to pardon him, he could not be prosecuted.
[01:41:34.758 --> 01:41:36.939]  If he were pardoned, he could not be prosecuted.
[01:41:36.979 --> 01:41:39.719]  Just like... No, it's not like it's a bunch of different acts.
[01:41:39.839 --> 01:41:42.240]  If the next president pardons him...
[01:41:42.734 --> 01:41:44.035]  He pardoned him for it.
[01:41:44.055 --> 01:41:47.076]  But we've never had a pardon, have we, for a bogus war.
[01:41:47.616 --> 01:41:48.576]  No, no, no.
[01:41:48.596 --> 01:41:49.457]  This is the first time.
[01:41:49.897 --> 01:41:52.418]  We've been in existence for close to 300 centuries.
[01:41:52.638 --> 01:41:59.020]  No American president would ever dream, would ever dream of taking this nation to war under false pretenses.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.161]  This guy is an aberration.
[01:42:01.201 --> 01:42:03.442]  He's a grotesque anomaly.
[01:42:03.542 --> 01:42:06.123]  Let's hope we never have another one like him.
[01:42:06.423 --> 01:42:09.564]  I want to talk about one other piece of evidence, and there's so much more in my book.
[01:42:10.824 --> 01:42:11.625]  January the 31st,
[01:42:14.116 --> 01:42:19.039]  2003, close to two months before Bush invaded Iraq.
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:33.167]  Bush and Tony Blair, British Prime Minister, meet in the Oval Office with six of their aides, one of whom was Blair's chief foreign policy advisor, David Manning.
[01:42:33.227 --> 01:42:36.149]  Is this the White House memo where he talks about painting a U.S.
[01:42:36.209 --> 01:42:37.069]  plane up like a U.N.?
[01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.990]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:38.330 --> 01:42:39.650]  That's in my film, Terror Storm.
[01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:42.312]  And that's what you read about, that I wrote about, yes.
[01:42:43.055 --> 01:42:44.236]  What is he trying to do?
[01:42:44.276 --> 01:42:46.157]  Here's what happened.
[01:42:46.338 --> 01:42:51.281]  Manning wrote in the memo, in the memo, and he wrote it the very, very same day.
[01:42:51.301 --> 01:43:04.531]  It was a five-page memo stamped, extremely sensitive, that during the meeting, Bush and Blair expressed their doubt that any weapons of mass destruction would ever be found in Iraq.
[01:43:04.591 --> 01:43:09.335]  Now, this is two months before he goes to war, claiming that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[01:43:09.635 --> 01:43:11.697]  But here's where it gets even worse than that.
[01:43:12.412 --> 01:43:29.436]  Manning wrote that Bush was so worried and so upset over the fact that UN inspectors had not found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that he talked about, quote, provoking a confrontation with Hussein.
[01:43:31.017 --> 01:43:34.378]  Three possible ways of doing it, one of which, as you indicated, Alex,
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:46.228]  Was to fly U-2 aircraft over Iraq, falsely painted in United Nations colors, and Bush said, if Hussein fires on this aircraft, it would be a violation of U.N.
[01:43:46.908 --> 01:43:48.730]  resolutions and would justify war.
[01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:50.491]  But that would mean that he thought the U.N.
[01:43:50.511 --> 01:43:51.812]  was going to go along with that line.
[01:43:53.493 --> 01:43:54.694]  Well, no, no, no, no.
[01:43:54.734 --> 01:43:56.496]  He's not talking about the U.N.
[01:43:56.516 --> 01:43:56.936]  doing it.
[01:43:57.076 --> 01:43:57.877]  No, no, the U.S.
[01:43:57.937 --> 01:43:58.277]  doing it.
[01:43:58.557 --> 01:43:59.238]  I understand.
[01:43:59.858 --> 01:44:05.022]  Anyway, here we have George Bush telling Americans, telling the world,
[01:44:05.697 --> 01:44:11.161]  That Hussein is an imminent threat to the security of this country, and we have to strike first in self-defense.
[01:44:11.181 --> 01:44:12.242]  And they're trying to provocateur.
[01:44:12.482 --> 01:44:19.968]  But behind closed doors, this small man is talking about how to provoke Hussein into a war.
[01:44:20.429 --> 01:44:26.754]  The very last person in the world that someone acting in self-defense would try to provoke is the person they're in deathly fear of.
[01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:29.155]  The person who's about to kill them.
[01:44:29.455 --> 01:44:43.843]  And isn't that, as a prosecutor, key to show that he consciously, premeditatedly knew he was fixing intelligence around it and trying to provocateur, as the White House memo says, the Downing Street memo says, fixing intelligence around it.
[01:44:43.903 --> 01:44:46.885]  So that shows that they knew they were lying and it was a fraud.
[01:44:46.905 --> 01:44:47.125]  Absolutely.
[01:44:47.385 --> 01:44:48.946]  That's the Downing Street memo.
[01:44:48.966 --> 01:44:50.707]  But I'm talking about the Manning memo.
[01:44:50.747 --> 01:44:52.408]  No, the White House memo.
[01:44:52.728 --> 01:44:53.869]  The Downing Street memo
[01:44:54.429 --> 01:44:59.054]  Is that we decided to go to war, now let's fix the facts to justify the war that we already want.
[01:44:59.134 --> 01:45:04.821]  The Manning Street Memo, we got George Bush talking about how to provoke Hussein into a war.
[01:45:05.281 --> 01:45:13.550]  If he felt that Hussein was an imminent threat to the security of this country, the thought of provoking Hussein into a war would never, ever, ever have entered his mind.
[01:45:13.871 --> 01:45:15.673]  We're talking about bad people here now.
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:21.143]  And they've gotten by with it because of the incredibly inept and spineless media.
[01:45:21.564 --> 01:45:26.907]  We're talking about media who are literally physiological marvels.
[01:45:26.927 --> 01:45:30.369]  They're able to sit erect in front of a camera without having a spine.
[01:45:30.409 --> 01:45:33.792]  I'm talking about the Charlie Roses of the world and the George Stephanopoulos.
[01:45:34.612 --> 01:45:37.874]  But I'm not going to let this guy get by with it if I can prevent it.
[01:45:37.994 --> 01:45:39.956]  Okay, Joe Rogan, any questions or comments?
[01:45:41.885 --> 01:45:42.685]  Here's a question.
[01:45:43.146 --> 01:45:45.168]  Would other people have to be prosecuted as well?
[01:45:45.588 --> 01:45:47.349]  Would the Senate have to be prosecuted?
[01:45:47.530 --> 01:45:52.174]  I mean, if you prosecuted George Bush for these crimes, would other people have to be brought in?
[01:45:52.514 --> 01:45:54.596]  Well, they would not have to be, but they would.
[01:45:54.716 --> 01:45:56.738]  Undoubtedly, Bush conspired with these people.
[01:45:56.778 --> 01:45:58.699]  He didn't take the nation to war all by himself.
[01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:02.643]  There's no question that Cheney and Rice are involved, probably Rove.
[01:46:03.163 --> 01:46:03.904]  They'd all be prosecuted.
[01:46:03.924 --> 01:46:08.388]  The Office of Special Plans that created a special intelligence unit to make stuff up?
[01:46:09.128 --> 01:46:10.469]  Yeah, I'm talking about Fyfe's group.
[01:46:11.409 --> 01:46:14.330]  Here we got 16 authorized U.S.
[01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:30.357]  intelligence agencies, but then they wanted their own bought and paid for agencies, so they have this guy, Fyfe, who's working in the Department of Defense, has no experience whatsoever in intelligence, and this rogue group, on its own, is trying to feed Bush exactly what Bush wants to hear.
[01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:32.838]  But, Brownie, you're doing a hell of a job.
[01:46:33.698 --> 01:46:34.479]  Pardon?
[01:46:34.879 --> 01:46:36.380]  Member Brownie, you're doing a hell of a job.
[01:46:37.972 --> 01:46:41.554]  What do you believe is going to happen if the Democrats win?
[01:46:41.854 --> 01:46:43.895]  Is that going to make any difference?
[01:46:44.215 --> 01:46:47.097]  Is that going to change the climate of possible prosecution?
[01:46:47.617 --> 01:46:51.099]  Well, you see, on a federal level, let me explain to you.
[01:46:51.179 --> 01:46:55.301]  On a federal level, there's really only one prosecutor who could bring these charges.
[01:46:55.341 --> 01:46:55.801]  That's U.S.
[01:46:55.861 --> 01:46:57.222]  Attorney General Washington D.C.
[01:46:57.262 --> 01:46:59.423]  Now, there are 93 U.S.
[01:46:59.503 --> 01:47:01.404]  attorneys throughout the entire country.
[01:47:02.003 --> 01:47:04.665]  And theoretically, they could bring the charge also.
[01:47:04.765 --> 01:47:11.932]  But as a practical matter, it's very, very unlikely that they would go against Bush without the consent of their boss, the Attorney General of Washington, D.C.
[01:47:11.952 --> 01:47:18.497]  So from a realistic standpoint, on a federal level, we're only talking about one prosecutor, the U.S.
[01:47:18.537 --> 01:47:19.818]  Attorney General of Washington, D.C.
[01:47:20.099 --> 01:47:26.364]  But on a state level, we're talking about 50 Attorney Generals throughout the country, plus the district attorneys,
[01:47:27.051 --> 01:47:28.833]  In counties within those states.
[01:47:29.033 --> 01:47:36.819]  And I say that it's not unreasonable at all to believe that there's one guy out there, at least one guy, that's going to be courageous enough to step forward and say, I'm going to go after him.
[01:47:36.839 --> 01:47:37.960]  I'm going to go after him.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.141]  I think you're making sense.
[01:47:39.181 --> 01:47:40.122]  I think that is possible.
[01:47:40.182 --> 01:47:48.529]  What I'm saying is, do you believe that in the wake of a Democratic election, if the Democrats win,
[01:47:48.909 --> 01:47:55.851]  Do you think that it's possible that people will start looking at this war, at this presidency, looking at it more clearly?
[01:47:55.871 --> 01:48:07.916]  Yeah, does that increase the chances of... No, I think that after, and it's just speculation, people are concerned about what the Dodgers are doing or the Yankees, their memory.
[01:48:09.056 --> 01:48:11.437]  It's as permanent as a breath upon the air.
[01:48:11.457 --> 01:48:14.399]  Well, look what Bush did for Pardongate with Clinton.
[01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:19.942]  He called Congressman Burton's committee and said, drop your investigation, let's just start anew.
[01:48:20.242 --> 01:48:28.287]  So there's this tendency to cover up the crimes of the last administration by the new one, because they want to get their back scratched when they leave in four to eight years.
[01:48:28.647 --> 01:48:29.187]  Absolutely.
[01:48:29.307 --> 01:48:33.210]  I think the likelihood of a prosecution here is going to be on a state and local level.
[01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:41.735]  I don't have any confidence in any Democratic President instructing his Attorney General to bring charges against Bush.
[01:48:41.795 --> 01:48:44.116]  He's going to probably be catering to the right wing.
[01:48:44.256 --> 01:48:50.820]  They're all catered to the right wing, but they don't realize that the only way you can cater to the right wing is to change your registration.
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:54.402]  And by the way, I want to say this very, very clearly to your audience.
[01:48:55.692 --> 01:49:00.236]  Because there's been some suggestion that this is politically motivated.
[01:49:00.736 --> 01:49:10.105]  I've been a lifetime Democrat only because I am always for the little guy, and unless there's some compelling reason to be otherwise, I'm for the little guy.
[01:49:10.145 --> 01:49:12.648]  But my political orientation is not rigid.
[01:49:12.688 --> 01:49:15.891]  I supported McCain's run for presidency in 2000.
[01:49:16.431 --> 01:49:20.195]  And in my professional career, whether I'm prosecuted a murderer,
[01:49:20.799 --> 01:49:25.943]  Well, whether I'm writing a true crime book, credibility has always meant everything to me.
[01:49:26.043 --> 01:49:34.609]  Well, Vincent Bugliosi, we understand this isn't left or right, and we understand this is a conservative-slash-libertarian show, so we don't really get into the whole left-right paradigm.
[01:49:34.749 --> 01:49:39.772]  I would love to invite you back on to get into a part two of this book in the next month or so, sir.
[01:49:39.792 --> 01:49:40.493]  I'd appreciate it.
[01:49:40.893 --> 01:49:47.418]  Yes, sir, and I'd also like to talk about your new JFK book that you've got out that's a thousand-something pages.
[01:49:47.858 --> 01:49:48.638]  It's more than that.
[01:49:48.738 --> 01:49:52.200]  It's the equivalent of 13 volumes of 400-page books.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.201]  It's already come out.
[01:49:53.281 --> 01:49:54.141]  It's already come out.
[01:49:54.401 --> 01:49:58.543]  And it just won the Edgar Allan Poe Award for the best true crime book of the year.
[01:49:58.563 --> 01:50:00.624]  I was in New York City last year.
[01:50:00.664 --> 01:50:01.424]  How long is it really?
[01:50:01.464 --> 01:50:02.845]  I read it was like 1,500 pages.
[01:50:03.005 --> 01:50:11.149]  Well, the main text is 1,630 pages or something, but then there's a CD-ROM attached to it of another 1,000 pages.
[01:50:11.209 --> 01:50:11.669]  So it's 3,400 pages.
[01:50:14.031 --> 01:50:18.556]  It's the book on the case and review after review saying it's a book for the ages.
[01:50:18.677 --> 01:50:22.241]  Scott Turow said centuries from now people are going to be reading this book.
[01:50:22.541 --> 01:50:25.145]  And as I say, Tom Hanks and his people are doing a 10-hour miniseries on it.
[01:50:25.185 --> 01:50:25.745]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:50:25.785 --> 01:50:31.132]  Mr. Bugliosi thinks he has the proof that it was a lone guy that did it, and I can't wait to have him on to talk about it.
[01:50:31.172 --> 01:50:32.113]  I'd love to be on the show!
[01:50:33.359 --> 01:50:34.900]  Well, sir, I like you guys.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:35.680]  I like you guys.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.561]  Listen, there's no time like the present.
[01:50:38.801 --> 01:50:42.243]  How about I set you up in a week or two to come on and talk about it?
[01:50:42.423 --> 01:50:48.686]  Okay, the only problem there is that I may be... I have a heavy schedule right now, so I'll give you a phone number.
[01:50:48.706 --> 01:50:52.127]  Call Sandy Mendelson, 212... Hold on, let's not give her number out on air, sir.
[01:50:52.507 --> 01:50:53.107]  You're in the break.
[01:50:53.147 --> 01:50:54.268]  Let me talk to you right now.
[01:50:54.428 --> 01:50:54.648]  Okay.
[01:50:54.688 --> 01:50:56.289]  Okay, stay there, sir.
[01:51:03.843 --> 01:51:07.126]  I like you guys.
[01:51:07.186 --> 01:51:07.886]  I like you guys.
[01:51:08.047 --> 01:51:09.308]  Stand-up guys.
[01:51:09.348 --> 01:51:10.809]  There's no time like the present.
[01:51:11.029 --> 01:51:14.492]  How about I set you up in a week or two to come on and talk about it?
[01:51:14.652 --> 01:51:20.897]  Okay, the only problem there is that I may be... I have a heavy schedule right now, so I'll give you a phone number.
[01:51:20.937 --> 01:51:22.539]  Call Sandy Mendelson.
[01:51:22.599 --> 01:51:24.360]  Hold on, let's not give her number out on air, sir.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:25.341]  You're in the break.
[01:51:25.381 --> 01:51:26.502]  Let me talk to you right now.
[01:51:26.642 --> 01:51:28.523]  Okay, stay there, sir.
[01:51:35.911 --> 01:51:37.312]  It is a big idea.
[01:51:37.332 --> 01:51:39.434]  A New World Order.
[01:51:40.134 --> 01:51:44.337]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:51:45.037 --> 01:51:47.199]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:51:47.859 --> 01:51:50.061]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:51:50.641 --> 01:51:53.103]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:51:53.844 --> 01:52:01.149]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:52:04.173 --> 01:52:09.136]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:52:09.636 --> 01:52:13.098]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:52:13.498 --> 01:52:15.959]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:52:16.059 --> 01:52:17.200]  Most people have no idea.
[01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:17.980]  They're not after money.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.081]  They have all the money they need.
[01:52:19.281 --> 01:52:20.001]  They're after power.
[01:52:20.261 --> 01:52:21.522]  That's what they're after these years.
[01:52:21.582 --> 01:52:25.944]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:52:26.165 --> 01:52:29.646]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:30.127 --> 01:52:30.507]  Endgame.
[01:52:30.887 --> 01:52:32.408]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:34.098]  You have the warrant.
[01:52:35.262 --> 01:52:38.785]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[01:52:39.045 --> 01:52:43.489]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[01:52:43.749 --> 01:52:48.653]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[01:52:49.053 --> 01:53:00.062]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[01:53:00.282 --> 01:53:02.644]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[01:53:03.044 --> 01:53:04.785]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[01:53:05.085 --> 01:53:05.745]  Let's face it.
[01:53:06.006 --> 01:53:08.547]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[01:53:08.827 --> 01:53:16.371]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[01:53:16.851 --> 01:53:18.912]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:53:19.132 --> 01:53:22.014]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:53:22.254 --> 01:53:26.036]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[01:53:26.336 --> 01:53:28.037]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[01:53:28.497 --> 01:53:30.858]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:53:31.330 --> 01:53:32.757]  And it's safe for all cars.
[01:53:32.777 --> 01:53:33.300]  Act now.
[01:53:36.693 --> 01:53:41.435]  Do you want to know right now how you can drive around using water as fuel and laugh at rising gas costs?
[01:53:41.736 --> 01:53:43.717]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[01:53:43.997 --> 01:53:48.999]  GasFreedom.info has all the information you need to learn about a simple technology you can have right now.
[01:53:49.359 --> 01:53:52.801]  GasFreedom is a do-it-yourself, affordable, practical, free energy device.
[01:53:53.101 --> 01:53:57.804]  It uses a little electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[01:53:58.244 --> 01:54:03.767]  HHO, also called Brown's Gas, burns beautifully and provides tons of energy, while the end product is just water.
[01:54:16.354 --> 01:54:18.656]  Well, we've had Joe for about an hour and 50 minutes.
[01:54:18.696 --> 01:54:21.277]  He's agreed to stay with us until near the end of the next hour.
[01:54:21.297 --> 01:54:24.900]  I don't want to twist his arm, but he says he's having fun.
[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:29.503]  So next hour, we're going to open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:29.943 --> 01:54:36.848]  We'll also give the local in-studio number out here in Austin, Texas, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, or 512-646-5400, your chance to talk to
[01:54:45.954 --> 01:54:48.575]  The host of Ultimate Fighting Championships.
[01:54:50.356 --> 01:54:52.377]  The man, Joe Rogan, joerogan.net.
[01:54:53.537 --> 01:55:00.140]  Of course, news radio star, star of Fear Factor, star of a new big CBS show coming out that's top secret, he can't talk about it.
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:03.081]  Internationally known, a top comedian.
[01:55:04.241 --> 01:55:05.482]  Just an amazing individual.
[01:55:05.822 --> 01:55:13.665]  Joe, it has been real fun having you on, and I tell you, I'm glad that Off-Air you've agreed to come on every few months, because I really look forward to it.
[01:55:14.349 --> 01:55:17.230]  Well, the last time I was on was, like, September 11th, I think.
[01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:19.831]  Yeah, we had quantified on air!
[01:55:20.812 --> 01:55:24.113]  Yeah, well, you know, I just thought you were jumping to conclusions about it.
[01:55:24.513 --> 01:55:36.117]  And who knows, like I said, as time changes, the more, you know, you look at events of the past, the more I look at what's going on in the present, the more I think, wow, I mean, how crazy is reality?
[01:55:36.518 --> 01:55:38.238]  You know, what is actually possible?
[01:55:38.358 --> 01:55:40.159]  How much actually has been conspired?
[01:55:40.686 --> 01:55:47.511]  I mean, how crazy would it be if it really was a gigantic conspiracy, and if Alex Jones is 100% right?
[01:55:48.191 --> 01:55:48.972]  Well, I wish I wasn't.
[01:55:48.992 --> 01:55:49.672]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:55:50.072 --> 01:56:03.361]  I read in government biology reports, because I'm a weirdo, I read stuff like that, in 1998 that there were half-human, half-cow creatures being grown in South Korea, in cows, for harvesting their DNA.
[01:56:03.421 --> 01:56:05.863]  Now, that finally hit the BBC two weeks ago.
[01:56:06.838 --> 01:56:13.664]  I think that's, I always said that if they're telling you that they can clone people, the guy telling you might be a clone.
[01:56:14.085 --> 01:56:14.525]  Exactly.
[01:56:14.665 --> 01:56:22.012]  By the time it gets to us, by the time that information gets to the general public, it's more, it's different now because of the internet.
[01:56:22.252 --> 01:56:23.593]  The internet things just get out.
[01:56:24.014 --> 01:56:28.358]  But, you know, like decades ago, come on, nothing got out.
[01:56:28.778 --> 01:56:31.899]  If they wanted to hide something, that's what people don't understand.
[01:56:32.019 --> 01:56:39.220]  When people look at, like, hiding things and conspiracies, they look at, like, a possible conspiracy, like, how difficult it would be to do in 2008.
[01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:47.361]  I mean, we compare it to the context that we think about it in is our life now, in the age of information.
[01:56:47.681 --> 01:56:49.682]  But this is so recent.
[01:56:50.442 --> 01:56:51.382]  So recent!
[01:56:51.722 --> 01:56:56.783]  Just a decade ago, just ten years, just a few thousand days.
[01:56:57.469 --> 01:56:59.710]  No one had this kind of access to information.
[01:56:59.970 --> 01:57:08.893]  We're googling things in your iPhone and the high-speed internet everywhere virtually and Wi-Fi and so many different places.
[01:57:09.053 --> 01:57:11.454]  Well Joe, a lot of... This is a different world we live in.
[01:57:11.494 --> 01:57:12.875]  You're right, a lot of professors and...
[01:57:13.195 --> 01:57:27.168]  Information technology experts and security experts, people I've talked to, say that the establishment is still run by like 70, 80, 90 year old men and they thought they could carry out a 9-11 like they did with JFK and be able to cover it up and control the info.
[01:57:27.528 --> 01:57:36.356]  They didn't even realize, even though they had think tanks telling them, that things have changed today, but they're still able to suppress a lot of the different secret aircraft they had, like the SR-71,
[01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:41.460]  Uh, it was in service in the early fifties, wasn't declassified until the seventies.
[01:57:42.321 --> 01:57:44.943]  Uh, in 1970 they already had the B-2 bomber out.
[01:57:45.244 --> 01:57:47.005]  It wasn't declassified until 87.
[01:57:47.305 --> 01:57:49.367]  Yeah, now that stuff was easy back then.
[01:57:49.828 --> 01:57:53.331]  It's so much more difficult now with Google Earth and all this different stuff.
[01:57:53.391 --> 01:57:55.452]  I mean, Google Earth, you could go look at Area 51.
[01:57:55.773 --> 01:57:57.474]  You know, how crazy is that?
[01:57:57.774 --> 01:57:58.435]  You could look at it.
[01:57:58.942 --> 01:58:00.984]  I mean, there's images of it online.
[01:58:01.004 --> 01:58:02.084]  There's pictures of it now.
[01:58:02.385 --> 01:58:04.886]  I mean, who knows if that's even a functional area anymore.
[01:58:04.927 --> 01:58:10.271]  But for the longest time, that was a legitimate, secret military base in the middle of the desert.
[01:58:10.351 --> 01:58:11.391]  Joe Rogan.
[01:58:11.572 --> 01:58:12.993]  JoeRogan.net's the website.
[01:58:13.033 --> 01:58:15.835]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are my websites.
[01:58:15.875 --> 01:58:16.475]  Joe, stay there.
[01:58:16.515 --> 01:58:17.936]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:19.117 --> 01:58:19.918]  You got the floor.
[01:58:19.998 --> 01:58:21.259]  What do you want to talk about when we get back?
[01:58:21.759 --> 01:58:23.260]  Oh, whatever you want to talk about, man.
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:24.041]  I'm down with everything.
[01:58:24.281 --> 01:58:30.945]  We can get more into DMT and dreaming and which consciousness is more real or is it two separate equally real consciousnesses.
[01:58:31.225 --> 01:58:33.746]  And we'll also take phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 or 888-201-2244.
[01:58:33.767 --> 01:58:35.548]  We'll be right back with Joe Rogan.
[01:58:35.568 --> 01:58:37.088]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:59:56.094 --> 01:59:58.014]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:58.494 --> 02:00:01.275]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:17.231 --> 02:00:18.112]  I have a rule.
[02:00:19.252 --> 02:00:20.853]  We do not screen your phone calls.
[02:00:21.393 --> 02:00:26.096]  Unless you're a half dozen stalkers I've got, and I recognize your voices, and I still let you on.
[02:00:29.998 --> 02:00:31.899]  If you disagree with me, you go to the head of the line.
[02:00:33.677 --> 02:00:33.877]  1-800-225-99231.
[02:00:33.897 --> 02:00:42.284]  And here in my in-studio number, 888-202-201-2244.
[02:00:42.304 --> 02:00:43.384]  888-201-2244.
[02:00:44.065 --> 02:00:45.186]  Will in Philly disagrees.
[02:00:45.246 --> 02:00:46.627]  His call is coming up after the break.
[02:00:47.488 --> 02:00:51.070]  But Joe, there is so much to discuss, so much going on.
[02:00:51.191 --> 02:01:01.478]  Going back to a discussion we were having 45 minutes ago, DMT, which is a naturally occurring chemical in the brain associated with dreaming, associated with these out-of-body experiences, because I've read up on it as well,
[02:01:02.619 --> 02:01:06.820]  And I was telling the story, and folks, the government believes this.
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:09.661]  We're going to get General Stubblebine, a three-star general, back on.
[02:01:09.681 --> 02:01:15.902]  We're lining him up, because George Clooney's making a movie about him with the writer that wrote a book about me in Bohemian Grove, John Ronson.
[02:01:16.723 --> 02:01:20.264]  Jack Black's making a movie about that, making fun of me and others, called Them.
[02:01:20.284 --> 02:01:22.204]  But this is a separate book, The Men Who Stare at Goats.
[02:01:22.584 --> 02:01:26.505]  And I've had Stubblebine on, and he believes that he can astrally project.
[02:01:26.565 --> 02:01:29.426]  This is a former special forces commander of all special forces.
[02:01:30.226 --> 02:01:31.948]  They train the special forces to do this.
[02:01:31.988 --> 02:01:33.570]  I've had special forces on the show.
[02:01:34.211 --> 02:01:44.962]  I never get into weird stuff like that, except that the government believes it, and they've experimented with DMT and other hallucinogens and other chemicals that are naturally in the body, or things that trigger those natural things.
[02:01:44.982 --> 02:01:47.004]  That's all drugs do, is trigger other things in your body.
[02:01:47.525 --> 02:01:48.906]  You know me, I'm a teetotaler, folks.
[02:01:49.707 --> 02:01:50.307]  I think so.
[02:02:05.117 --> 02:02:12.882]  But over and over again, I've had a dream say when I'm 10, about on a golf course in front of my parents' house, they're going to build a house there.
[02:02:13.643 --> 02:02:19.186]  And, you know, I pictured myself walking in, looking out at, you know, at a window at night, and I would have the dream recurring.
[02:02:19.487 --> 02:02:29.914]  Then years later, they built a house there, and me and friends as teenagers went in and looked out that very window on that golf course, and a dog I saw in the dream run across the golf course, came running across.
[02:02:29.994 --> 02:02:31.094]  It was the exact same thing.
[02:02:31.335 --> 02:02:34.977]  This wasn't like deja vu, where I told people about this dream.
[02:02:35.477 --> 02:02:42.843]  But I've had dreams where I was mugged in the very guy, the very shirt, and these dreams are always very upsetting is how I know it's real and going to come true.
[02:02:43.763 --> 02:02:46.485]  But Joe wanted to get back into that with DMT experiences.
[02:02:46.545 --> 02:02:46.765]  Joe?
[02:02:47.406 --> 02:02:52.930]  Well, first of all, the Army Research Group has known about DMT since the 60s.
[02:02:53.230 --> 02:03:04.258]  The way Terence McKenna found out about DMT is he had a friend who was a scientist who was working for the Army Research Group, and this guy brought home some DMT.
[02:03:04.979 --> 02:03:07.565]  And he gave it to Terrence to try.
[02:03:08.066 --> 02:03:08.527]  And it was...
[02:03:10.743 --> 02:03:12.744]  Something that they were experimenting with.
[02:03:12.784 --> 02:03:14.185]  They were trying to figure out what it is.
[02:03:14.326 --> 02:03:15.807]  So they've known about it for a long time.
[02:03:15.867 --> 02:03:19.869]  The fact that they've been able to keep this under wraps is really crazy.
[02:03:20.090 --> 02:03:22.851]  The fact that they've been able to keep this substance a secret.
[02:03:22.871 --> 02:03:27.515]  I mean, if it was a plot in a movie, you would never believe that they'd be able to keep this a secret.
[02:03:27.855 --> 02:03:36.361]  If there was a plot in a movie, and in the movie there was a powder that existed, this substance, this compound, that existed in almost everything,
[02:03:36.741 --> 02:03:51.499]  It exists in all these different kinds of plants, and people make it in their own bodies, and this substance allows you to have, essentially, an experience where you're communicating with something above reality, something above
[02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:57.662]  You, whether it's a god, or whether it's angels, or whether it's some sort of an inter-dimensional intelligence.
[02:03:57.682 --> 02:03:58.482]  But that's it, Joe!
[02:03:58.582 --> 02:04:00.543]  I'm a pretty secular, mainline guy.
[02:04:00.943 --> 02:04:06.886]  I'm not, I'll tell you, I've had experiences I won't say on air, because they'd make fun of me, and a lot more bizarre than that.
[02:04:07.146 --> 02:04:08.346]  And I mean, this stuff is real.
[02:04:08.686 --> 02:04:12.748]  I told people, man, I had this upsetting dream, it's like those dreams I have that come true.
[02:04:14.449 --> 02:04:16.230]  I told people about it, and then it happened.
[02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:17.791]  Well, Alex, I don't think it's crazy.
[02:04:17.851 --> 02:04:23.515]  What I'm saying is that we only think it's crazy because we can't do it every day.
[02:04:23.575 --> 02:04:26.737]  But if you think about the things that we can do every day, just this.
[02:04:27.237 --> 02:04:28.458]  Look at what we're doing right here.
[02:04:28.718 --> 02:04:35.002]  Is being able to predict an event any crazier than the idea that you and I are communicating right now in real time?
[02:04:35.282 --> 02:04:37.363]  Through the air, across the world.
[02:04:37.964 --> 02:04:38.644]  I mean, that's nuts!
[02:04:38.724 --> 02:04:43.927]  No, you're in LA, I'm in Austin, the network's in Minnesota, the satellites are going around the Earth.
[02:04:44.388 --> 02:04:47.750]  Yeah, the ability to predict the future is no crazier than that.
[02:04:48.070 --> 02:04:49.091]  That's just as crazy.
[02:04:49.331 --> 02:04:53.313]  It's just the ability to predict the future, the ability to see reality from other angles.
[02:04:53.333 --> 02:04:55.174]  Well, that's what... With rich premonitions.
[02:04:55.535 --> 02:04:58.556]  All that stuff is just, we just can't do it all the time.
[02:04:58.577 --> 02:05:00.298]  Stay there, we're gonna talk behind the scenes right now.
[02:05:00.338 --> 02:05:00.578]  Here we go.
[02:05:03.681 --> 02:05:04.361]  Sorry to interrupt, Joe.
[02:05:04.381 --> 02:05:06.722]  You know about these dumb ads you're on TV and everything else.
[02:05:06.962 --> 02:05:07.902]  Yeah, they're cool, man.
[02:05:08.042 --> 02:05:08.963]  Well, they're great ads, actually.
[02:05:08.983 --> 02:05:09.683]  It's how we operate.
[02:05:09.703 --> 02:05:10.203]  You know what I mean?
[02:05:10.223 --> 02:05:10.563]  Absolutely.
[02:05:10.703 --> 02:05:11.183]  I hear you, buddy.
[02:05:11.443 --> 02:05:15.625]  No, I mean, you're absolutely right about... I mean, magic.
[02:05:15.665 --> 02:05:16.785]  It's what Arthur C. Clarke said.
[02:05:16.825 --> 02:05:21.727]  He said, a hundred years ago, the technologies we have now would have been indistinguishable from magic.
[02:05:22.447 --> 02:05:22.727]  Right.
[02:05:22.887 --> 02:05:23.507]  Exactly.
[02:05:23.787 --> 02:05:24.127]  Exactly.
[02:05:24.147 --> 02:05:24.748]  Keep talking about it.
[02:05:25.088 --> 02:05:25.368]  Go ahead.
[02:05:25.488 --> 02:05:26.048]  Absolutely.
[02:05:27.116 --> 02:05:29.059]  Let's talk about it now because we're on the internet, right?
[02:05:29.219 --> 02:05:29.940]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:36.228]  I want to just continue because the ad cut you off, but let's just continue because this will be much bigger later on the web itself.
[02:05:36.653 --> 02:05:42.037]  Well, it's very possible that there's an infinite number of things that we can't perceive.
[02:05:42.397 --> 02:05:54.326]  And the way I describe it is, and I want to talk about this, I would like to talk about this on the radio because it's a really big point, and the point is that there's a thing that I like to call the fart principle, and it's a goofy way of describing it.
[02:05:54.346 --> 02:06:02.912]  Alright, well the fart principle is so key, let's talk about it after we come out to the main audience, but going back, judging some behind the scenes stuff, how's your life going?
[02:06:03.032 --> 02:06:04.213]  Is Joe Rogan happy with life?
[02:06:04.833 --> 02:06:06.455]  Joe Rogan's happy as can be, man.
[02:06:06.775 --> 02:06:08.597]  Although I don't like talking about myself like that.
[02:06:09.858 --> 02:06:11.080]  I'm doing the Roy Jones Jr.
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:12.441]  talking about myself in the third person.
[02:06:12.941 --> 02:06:14.643]  But no, I'm happy as can be, man.
[02:06:14.663 --> 02:06:15.064]  You know what?
[02:06:15.424 --> 02:06:24.613]  I think I just try to live my life and have as much fun as possible, be as nice to people as possible, have a bunch of good friends and good experiences, and pursue my interests.
[02:06:24.673 --> 02:06:27.016]  And I think that if you do that, you're going to have a happy life.
[02:06:27.566 --> 02:06:37.412]  I think that one of the keys to having a happy life is what we were talking about earlier when we were talking about the Illuminati and all these people in control of the world, that they can't possibly be happy because they're not being nice to people.
[02:06:37.452 --> 02:06:38.372]  Oh no, none of them are!
[02:06:38.753 --> 02:06:39.573]  No, they're miserable.
[02:06:39.713 --> 02:06:40.914]  They've got to be miserable.
[02:06:40.934 --> 02:06:41.714]  How could you not be?
[02:06:41.734 --> 02:06:54.802]  You're causing hundreds of thousands of people to die unnecessary deaths and suffer and poor soldiers to come back from this horrible war and be disfigured and just ruined and have to struggle to get their medical benefits.
[02:06:54.882 --> 02:06:56.223]  I mean, it's an amazing thing.
[02:06:58.149 --> 02:07:02.952]  You'd have to be incredibly sick to live your life through that.
[02:07:02.972 --> 02:07:05.934]  There's no way you could actually be happy doing what you're doing.
[02:07:06.535 --> 02:07:07.155]  There's no way.
[02:07:08.806 --> 02:07:12.448]  I mean, I think if there's anything that's going to save the world, it's that realization.
[02:07:12.648 --> 02:07:14.589]  But then it goes back to what we were talking about before.
[02:07:14.649 --> 02:07:18.331]  Is it possible to enlighten a psychopath?
[02:07:18.772 --> 02:07:20.413]  Is it possible to enlighten a psychopath?
[02:07:20.433 --> 02:07:35.141]  I think it is to show them that even if they're mentally don't care about others and are really sadistic psychopaths, the worst type, and you've got sociopaths, psychopaths, and sadistic sociopaths, to explain to them that tearing up the world ends up coming back on them.
[02:07:36.161 --> 02:07:42.163]  Yeah, maybe, but they don't see it every day because I have a feeling that a lot of karma is how you feel about things.
[02:07:42.523 --> 02:07:47.984]  And if you don't feel bad about what you're doing, I don't necessarily think it comes back to you.
[02:07:48.444 --> 02:07:49.825]  It doesn't come back to you as much.
[02:07:50.105 --> 02:07:50.865]  I mean, look at Bush.
[02:07:50.885 --> 02:07:51.985]  That guy's old, man.
[02:07:52.005 --> 02:07:53.166]  He's been around a long time.
[02:07:53.226 --> 02:07:54.686]  He's been screwing over people forever.
[02:07:54.966 --> 02:07:55.606]  But he's fine.
[02:07:55.866 --> 02:07:57.447]  Look at his dad, Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:07:57.747 --> 02:07:58.487]  He's fine, too.
[02:07:58.827 --> 02:07:59.487]  Nothing wrong with him.
[02:07:59.507 --> 02:08:00.928]  He's like a normal old dude.
[02:08:00.968 --> 02:08:01.268]  Here we go.
[02:08:03.368 --> 02:08:08.433]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:08.773 --> 02:08:11.076]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.276 --> 02:08:14.017]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:08:14.037 --> 02:08:14.557]  to 2 p.m.
[02:08:14.597 --> 02:08:15.597]  Central Standard Time.
[02:08:15.637 --> 02:08:16.318]  We're here live.
[02:08:16.598 --> 02:08:18.438]  We had Jesse Ventura for you last week.
[02:08:18.498 --> 02:08:19.859]  Tommy Chung for you last week.
[02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:23.480]  We're going to have Tommy Chung and Cheech reunite.
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:30.363]  They just got back together last week for the first time in more than 20 years, they say, on this show.
[02:08:30.823 --> 02:08:31.944]  Coming up in about two weeks.
[02:08:32.324 --> 02:08:34.685]  Got some other big guests lined up during the week I'm not going to tell you about.
[02:08:35.325 --> 02:08:42.429]  Joe Rogan, host of Ultimate Fighting, fighting champion in his own right, starred in a whole bunch of top TV shows.
[02:08:42.929 --> 02:08:44.090]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[02:08:44.130 --> 02:08:49.673]  JoeRogan.net, got a lot of great comedy DVDs and CDs out there available.
[02:08:49.713 --> 02:08:53.014]  Find out more just by googling Joe Rogan or going to JoeRogan.net.
[02:08:53.034 --> 02:08:53.815]  Look, I know I've got
[02:08:55.489 --> 02:08:56.710]  Twenty-something phone calls here.
[02:08:56.730 --> 02:08:59.092]  The phone system is completely filled up, which it always does.
[02:08:59.112 --> 02:09:03.175]  I don't know how we're going to get to everybody, but we'll go to those in a few minutes with Joe Rogan.
[02:09:03.195 --> 02:09:06.577]  I don't want to burn him out coming on the show, but I'm really enjoying this.
[02:09:06.597 --> 02:09:07.538]  I want to have him back up soon.
[02:09:07.558 --> 02:09:08.639]  He's already been with us two hours.
[02:09:08.999 --> 02:09:11.120]  Joe, we were talking in the behind-the-scenes.
[02:09:11.901 --> 02:09:17.325]  You said what you call the fart principle, excuse your French, is so important that you wanted to say it to the full audience.
[02:09:17.685 --> 02:09:19.286]  So tell us about the...
[02:09:20.839 --> 02:09:23.841]  Well, this is what it means.
[02:09:23.861 --> 02:09:37.112]  It's a silly name, but the reason why I call it that is because the idea behind it is if you look at reality and how you perceive reality, we look through our eyes, we smell through our nose, we hear things,
[02:09:37.512 --> 02:09:45.375]  Well, if somebody farted around you and you couldn't smell, if you didn't hear it, you'd have no idea that anything was going on.
[02:09:45.875 --> 02:09:52.658]  If you didn't have a sense of smell, there'd be something invisible that you would not be able to detect, and you'd be just...
[02:09:53.278 --> 02:09:56.019]  Sitting in someone's stink and not even knowing about it, right?
[02:09:56.479 --> 02:10:01.822]  How do we know that there are an infinite number of things that we can't detect?
[02:10:02.102 --> 02:10:06.044]  And we can't even imagine because we just don't have the sensitivity to it.
[02:10:06.064 --> 02:10:08.164]  Well, the mathematical equations show that, Joe.
[02:10:08.184 --> 02:10:10.305]  It shows there are other dimensions all around us.
[02:10:14.167 --> 02:10:15.128]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:10:15.648 --> 02:10:15.888]  Sure.
[02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:17.269]  I mean, I've heard that.
[02:10:17.309 --> 02:10:18.330]  I don't really understand it.
[02:10:18.370 --> 02:10:19.731]  I can't really follow the logic of it.
[02:10:20.031 --> 02:10:21.172]  I'm not a mathematician.
[02:10:21.452 --> 02:10:32.200]  But from what I understand, you know, when you hear these guys talking about quantum physics and things, that they actually can sort of mathematically show that it's possible for there to be 11 different dimensions.
[02:10:32.220 --> 02:10:34.982]  But what I'm saying is, how do you know it's not infinite?
[02:10:35.062 --> 02:10:36.763]  How do you know that everything is not infinite?
[02:10:37.123 --> 02:10:45.268]  That what we're existing in is a very narrow bandwidth, a very narrow bandwidth of, you know, several dimensions we can see and touch and hear.
[02:10:45.688 --> 02:10:52.291]  And how do we know that there's not an infinite number of other possibilities that our imagination can't even perceive?
[02:10:52.351 --> 02:10:53.972]  Well, radio waves are invisible.
[02:10:54.292 --> 02:10:55.333]  TV waves are invisible.
[02:10:55.353 --> 02:10:55.873]  Exactly.
[02:10:55.933 --> 02:10:57.974]  Cell phone waves are invisible.
[02:10:58.155 --> 02:10:58.595]  All of that.
[02:10:58.675 --> 02:11:02.357]  There could be billions of different types of things like that that are invisible.
[02:11:02.937 --> 02:11:04.898]  Let me go back.
[02:11:04.918 --> 02:11:20.205]  80-year-old German quantum mechanics expert said that if Saturn is a gas giant, its mass should express some 7th or 8th dimensional vortex and that on its poles it would have giant ice hexagons.
[02:11:21.005 --> 02:11:27.452]  And then when Voyager flew over the top, it had a perfect hexagon on the top.
[02:11:27.572 --> 02:11:31.677]  And then they said it will express on a vortex, and it ended up expressing.
[02:11:31.957 --> 02:11:32.938]  I mean, that's amazing.
[02:11:33.719 --> 02:11:33.920]  Wow.
[02:11:34.676 --> 02:11:48.325]  Yeah, I mean, what science has been able to predict and perceive, you know, in regards to anything in space, black holes and hypernovas and all, I mean, it's just more and more evidence of how infinite and vast everything really is.
[02:11:48.345 --> 02:11:48.825]  Have you heard of that?
[02:11:48.845 --> 02:11:51.947]  And that's one of the things that you see in the DMT experience.
[02:11:52.127 --> 02:11:57.331]  One of the craziest things about the DMT experience is you have the feeling that you're connecting to everything
[02:11:57.811 --> 02:12:08.223]  All around you all at once, like you're in the center of the universe, that like you're a part of every atom, and every atom is you, and you're connected to it all, which we really are.
[02:12:08.484 --> 02:12:09.344]  I mean, it's an illusion.
[02:12:09.365 --> 02:12:11.247]  There is no real vacuum.
[02:12:11.607 --> 02:12:13.469]  I mean, there's something around us all this time.
[02:12:13.489 --> 02:12:17.494]  There's oxygen, and you know, molecules, and there's bacteria, and there's the...
[02:12:17.814 --> 02:12:19.477]  There's living organisms everywhere.
[02:12:19.497 --> 02:12:25.667]  We're all connected to this gigantic organism called the Earth, and that's connected to space, which is connected to other planets.
[02:12:25.988 --> 02:12:28.351]  I mean, everything really is all connected.
[02:12:28.692 --> 02:12:31.657]  It's just a gigantic illusion that we're separate.
[02:12:32.901 --> 02:12:44.170]  But, as you said, to a psychopath, they don't recognize that when they kidnap a kid and torture him to death, that really hurt and destroyed an entire family and tore their guts out because they don't have an olfactory nerve.
[02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:49.154]  They don't understand that they just went to the picnic party and diarrhea all over everything.
[02:12:50.254 --> 02:12:59.958]  I think they did a lot worse than that, but yeah, I mean, that's the real problem with karma, is people look at karma and they go, well, if karma is real, how come a guy like Bush is happy?
[02:13:00.018 --> 02:13:01.018]  How is that possible?
[02:13:01.318 --> 02:13:14.123]  Well, to a regular person, karma does work, and the way karma works is, you put out good feelings, you put out positive energy and love and happiness, and you get that back, and you feel this exchange.
[02:13:14.743 --> 02:13:15.204]  Thank you, sir.
[02:13:29.429 --> 02:13:33.933]  If you're one of those people, then really, karma is not the same for a person like that.
[02:13:33.953 --> 02:13:35.894]  Because they're not going to feel the bad.
[02:13:36.054 --> 02:13:37.575]  But see, Joe, I'm the opposite.
[02:13:37.715 --> 02:13:38.516]  I mean, I'm the opposite.
[02:13:38.596 --> 02:13:39.537]  I feel everything.
[02:13:39.597 --> 02:13:41.418]  It's so intense, I can't even articulate it.
[02:13:41.458 --> 02:13:43.700]  It's like I'm on high.
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:45.702]  I mean, I feel the good, the bad, the ugly.
[02:13:45.722 --> 02:13:47.443]  It's like, ah, just constantly.
[02:13:47.763 --> 02:13:49.945]  And I can't imagine somebody who doesn't feel it all.
[02:13:50.185 --> 02:13:56.452]  Well, that's why you're compelled to expose all these different things and get on the radio every day and try to alert people.
[02:13:56.692 --> 02:14:01.457]  Look, people who don't know you, when I talk to people, they go, hey, you're friends with Alex Jones, what's he like?
[02:14:01.477 --> 02:14:03.680]  I'm like, Alex is a great guy!
[02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:05.382]  He's always angry, he's fighting the world.
[02:14:06.102 --> 02:14:09.686]  He's just paying attention to all this crazy stuff and he wants to alert people.
[02:14:10.087 --> 02:14:10.948]  That's really what it is.
[02:14:11.408 --> 02:14:12.789]  Well, I know you want to alert people, too.
[02:14:12.849 --> 02:14:15.651]  It frustrates me to see people getting conned, getting hurt.
[02:14:15.971 --> 02:14:20.034]  It makes me mad at people who abuse and use people's ignorance against them.
[02:14:20.434 --> 02:14:21.835]  I mean, to me, that's like cheating.
[02:14:21.855 --> 02:14:22.716]  It's like a crime.
[02:14:22.736 --> 02:14:23.356]  It is horrible.
[02:14:23.536 --> 02:14:40.548]  It is a horrible thing, but I think that it's very possible that all the stuff that human beings do is a part of, like, a gigantic mathematical program, and that there is always going to be a mouse, and there's always going to be a cat, and there's always going to be a dog, and there's always going to be a person.
[02:14:40.868 --> 02:14:46.834]  There's a balance that's set up to everything, and there's always going to be idiots, and there's always going to be psychos that take advantage of those idiots.
[02:14:47.394 --> 02:15:01.407]  And all you can do is try to steer this thing in the most positive direction possible, and steer it in a way and explain to people in a way that they say, well, maybe I should live my life thinking of other people as if they're just like me.
[02:15:01.807 --> 02:15:06.332]  That we're all the same thing, experiencing this life through different circumstances.
[02:15:06.592 --> 02:15:09.315]  That's the only hope that we have as a race.
[02:15:09.595 --> 02:15:17.824]  If we can somehow or another think of all human beings as being the exact same thing at the base, like whatever you are is exactly the same as me.
[02:15:18.104 --> 02:15:20.526]  You would be me if you lived my life.
[02:15:20.626 --> 02:15:24.911]  If you were born me and you lived and had all my life experiences and all my
[02:15:25.311 --> 02:15:34.714]  The things that I've done in my memories and my genetics, and you live to this point in time where I'm talking to you on the phone right now, you would be me talking to you on the phone right now.
[02:15:34.994 --> 02:15:36.255]  It's exactly the same thing.
[02:15:36.275 --> 02:15:37.535]  With the same nature and nurture.
[02:15:37.575 --> 02:15:52.580]  Well, expanding on that Joe, I see it as a crime against the universe to try to dumb people down, to try to limit their creativity, to try to limit the spectrum of experience and expression that they have.
[02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:54.361]  And so I know there's always good and evil.
[02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:58.783]  That's my point is they're out of control, they're expanding it.
[02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:14.974]  All I know is my gut doesn't like them.
[02:16:15.335 --> 02:16:17.278]  My gut doesn't like them.
[02:16:17.318 --> 02:16:19.942]  Everything that's life and goodness, I know good and bad.
[02:16:20.263 --> 02:16:23.207]  And they're bad, and I don't like what shoots out of the end of their factory.
[02:16:23.488 --> 02:16:25.250]  I don't like what they produce, what they make.
[02:16:25.711 --> 02:16:26.572]  I'm just sick of them.
[02:16:26.612 --> 02:16:27.213]  They're scum!
[02:16:28.094 --> 02:16:29.675]  They are, absolutely, you're right.
[02:16:30.015 --> 02:16:32.457]  But, it might be a part of a natural process.
[02:16:32.897 --> 02:16:34.478]  There might need to be part of it.
[02:16:34.518 --> 02:16:36.339]  Yeah, and me getting my hands around their necks.
[02:16:36.359 --> 02:16:36.939]  Moving along.
[02:16:36.999 --> 02:16:39.721]  Me getting my hands around their necks can be part of a natural process, too.
[02:16:39.761 --> 02:16:40.841]  Well, you know what, buddy?
[02:16:40.881 --> 02:16:42.882]  I would like to be there with a camera and put it on YouTube.
[02:16:43.823 --> 02:16:44.883]  I think we'd get a lot of hits.
[02:16:45.144 --> 02:16:46.544]  Oh, Joe Rogan, he's something else.
[02:16:46.564 --> 02:16:48.325]  Let's make a call for somebody that disagrees.
[02:16:49.086 --> 02:16:51.107]  Will and Philly, you go right to the head of the line.
[02:16:51.147 --> 02:16:51.567]  Go ahead.
[02:16:52.267 --> 02:16:54.068]  Hey, Joe, it's great to have you on board.
[02:16:54.088 --> 02:16:54.869]  You're coming around.
[02:16:55.530 --> 02:16:56.651]  You just summed it up.
[02:16:56.751 --> 02:16:59.093]  You just summed it up with the food chain.
[02:16:59.133 --> 02:17:05.838]  These people are social Darwinians, as Alex says, and anything they can do to us is justified, just for that ipso facto.
[02:17:06.078 --> 02:17:07.600]  If they can do it, it's justified.
[02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:10.382]  Yeah, I believe there are a lot of people like that in the world.
[02:17:10.402 --> 02:17:11.463]  I think you're absolutely right.
[02:17:11.983 --> 02:17:14.545]  You said it's 70-30 for Alex?
[02:17:14.585 --> 02:17:17.628]  Let me tell you, my friend, it's more like 97-3.
[02:17:18.048 --> 02:17:20.470]  This gentleman did his homework.
[02:17:20.510 --> 02:17:21.831]  We need people like you, Joe.
[02:17:22.689 --> 02:17:26.451]  But if you come out, exercise a little bit of tact because they will blacklist you.
[02:17:27.491 --> 02:17:28.151]  Joe knows that.
[02:17:28.211 --> 02:17:29.632]  Joe's taking a risk doing this today.
[02:17:29.832 --> 02:17:30.072]  Yes.
[02:17:30.932 --> 02:17:33.153]  Well, not nobody takes me seriously.
[02:17:33.393 --> 02:17:35.874]  That's the beautiful thing about me and Nate.
[02:17:36.874 --> 02:17:37.475]  I'm a goof.
[02:17:37.495 --> 02:17:43.777]  I'm a fear factor host and a dirty stand-up comedian and I'm short and I'm going bald and I look dumb.
[02:17:44.297 --> 02:17:46.398]  You're an icon, my friend, for some people.
[02:17:46.966 --> 02:17:47.406]  What's that?
[02:17:47.686 --> 02:17:49.007]  You're an icon to some people.
[02:17:49.027 --> 02:17:50.988]  No, everybody I talk to likes Joe Rogan.
[02:17:51.008 --> 02:17:51.468]  Are you kidding?
[02:17:51.528 --> 02:17:55.050]  I mean, a lot of celebrity people hate, but everybody I talk to likes Joe.
[02:17:55.090 --> 02:17:58.411]  Well, that's very flattering, but I'm sure there's a bunch of people that think I'm a douchebag.
[02:17:58.471 --> 02:18:00.332]  Burmese is in there salivating right now.
[02:18:01.353 --> 02:18:02.173]  What's up, Jason?
[02:18:03.554 --> 02:18:05.175]  One thing, you can't do it all, Alex.
[02:18:06.539 --> 02:18:07.659]  I'm going to show people Burmas.
[02:18:07.679 --> 02:18:08.080]  Keep going.
[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:11.621]  Go to Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[02:18:11.641 --> 02:18:12.781]  This is not an opinion.
[02:18:12.801 --> 02:18:17.663]  50-ton steel beams don't eject 400 feet in gravitational collapses.
[02:18:18.243 --> 02:18:23.925]  To think that two planes can lead to the pulverization of three buildings is an absolute absurdity.
[02:18:26.066 --> 02:18:27.386]  You know, this is not an opinion.
[02:18:27.926 --> 02:18:33.168]  Check out Richard Gage's presentation, Blueprint for Truth.
[02:18:35.695 --> 02:18:36.457]  Absolutely!
[02:18:36.477 --> 02:18:38.361]  You know my sentiments, Mr. Jones.
[02:18:38.421 --> 02:18:39.423]  I'm one of your best critics.
[02:18:39.483 --> 02:18:43.893]  I'm not one of these milquetoast guys that call up and act like I, you know, I just try to
[02:18:44.521 --> 02:18:51.246]  To get things out in the light, to show people that you're 100% genuine in what you do.
[02:18:51.286 --> 02:18:54.368]  Well let me say this, I try to be genuine, I try to tell the truth.
[02:18:54.708 --> 02:18:55.609]  Do I get things wrong?
[02:18:55.629 --> 02:18:57.190]  We all do.
[02:18:57.550 --> 02:19:02.613]  Last week I did the analogy of how they kept the B-2 bombers secret and I got the years wrong.
[02:19:02.854 --> 02:19:12.160]  But the point is, I try to tell the truth, I try to get it right, and I'm doing this because I love people, and I'm doing this because I hate abusers and bullies, and I've always hated them.
[02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:14.862]  That comes through clear, Mr. Jones.
[02:19:15.723 --> 02:19:16.864]  I just want to leave you with this.
[02:19:17.505 --> 02:19:20.127]  Isn't our existence amazing with the Creator?
[02:19:20.247 --> 02:19:22.269]  Imagine the things that we don't know.
[02:19:22.941 --> 02:19:26.124]  And isn't it funny how they demonize Mother Nature?
[02:19:26.144 --> 02:19:27.125]  It's sickening.
[02:19:27.446 --> 02:19:32.330]  They use it, they know, they harness the power of Mother Nature themselves and they demonize it.
[02:19:32.571 --> 02:19:34.593]  Go to YouTube, Slave Plantation.
[02:19:34.893 --> 02:19:36.474]  Alright, good to hear from you sir, I appreciate it.
[02:19:36.515 --> 02:19:39.778]  We're going to continue behind the scenes with Joe Rogan, continuing to take calls.
[02:19:40.278 --> 02:19:45.664]  Anthony, William, Carl, Will, Mike, Ray, Scott, Mark, Rick, Kid, Nick.
[02:19:46.124 --> 02:19:48.445]  On and on and I don't know how we're going to get to all these with Joe Rogan.
[02:19:49.346 --> 02:19:52.388]  I had a ton of news I wanted to get to, but I'm just enjoying talking to Joe.
[02:19:52.908 --> 02:19:54.829]  And Joe's been really kind to spend this much time with us.
[02:19:55.229 --> 02:19:56.010]  JoeRogan.net.
[02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:57.491]  My website's InfoWars.com.
[02:20:02.574 --> 02:20:02.914]  Okay.
[02:20:04.995 --> 02:20:06.936]  We'll go ahead and take some calls behind the scenes.
[02:20:07.096 --> 02:20:07.937]  Anthony in New York.
[02:20:07.977 --> 02:20:08.637]  Is Anthony next?
[02:20:09.118 --> 02:20:10.058]  Yeah, what's up?
[02:20:10.258 --> 02:20:11.079]  Real fast, Anthony.
[02:20:11.119 --> 02:20:11.459]  Go ahead.
[02:20:12.279 --> 02:20:12.900]  Hey, what's up Alex?
[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:14.721]  Just wanted to take the time to thank you for what you're doing.
[02:20:15.231 --> 02:20:17.553]  I know you have a big money bomb coming up.
[02:20:36.886 --> 02:20:37.886]  I don't know what I'm trying to say.
[02:20:37.926 --> 02:20:42.949]  We need maybe a continental organization where maybe you get 9-11 Truth and you to be the founder because you started this.
[02:21:03.812 --> 02:21:06.813]  Everybody's waking up because of you and what We Are Change is doing.
[02:21:06.833 --> 02:21:07.534]  Let me be clear.
[02:21:07.674 --> 02:21:11.976]  Everybody is waking up, Anthony, because people are like you.
[02:21:12.316 --> 02:21:18.418]  You know, Joe can say the things he says, or I can say the things I say, but if people don't then carry the ball and tell others, nothing happens.
[02:21:18.438 --> 02:21:19.299]  So it's you, Anthony.
[02:21:19.559 --> 02:21:20.219]  Thanks for the call.
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:28.063]  You know, people always call me and thank me for what I'm doing, Joe, but really I see it as I'm a tiny little node, and then it's the listeners.
[02:21:28.563 --> 02:21:30.624]  They're the ones that give this show the effect it has.
[02:21:31.502 --> 02:21:36.863]  Well, you know, you're doing what you're supposed to be doing, what your personality is designed for.
[02:21:37.223 --> 02:21:41.244]  You're supposed to be uncovering all these things and exposing all these things.
[02:21:41.284 --> 02:21:42.025]  That's your passion.
[02:21:42.045 --> 02:21:43.605]  It's been for as long as I've known you.
[02:21:43.745 --> 02:21:45.705]  And then people tell me... You're a strange guy, dude.
[02:21:46.046 --> 02:21:49.606]  I've never met anybody that can pull information out of the top of their head like you can.
[02:21:49.886 --> 02:21:55.528]  You just start quoting studies and different things, and I'm like, how do you have time to research all this stuff?
[02:21:55.588 --> 02:21:56.168]  But you do!
[02:21:56.548 --> 02:22:00.369]  You know, you spend an incredible amount of time looking up all these things.
[02:22:01.445 --> 02:22:02.586]  Well, I wish they weren't true.
[02:22:02.606 --> 02:22:06.710]  I mean, I wish that I didn't understand the fraud they're carrying out, because it almost makes it worse.
[02:22:07.271 --> 02:22:09.853]  Because you were like a pig in a chute about to be butchered.
[02:22:10.194 --> 02:22:11.535]  You know, your whole life was happy.
[02:22:11.575 --> 02:22:13.176]  You didn't really know you were going to be butchered.
[02:22:13.437 --> 02:22:16.560]  But I'm like a pig in a box who knows I'm going to be killed.
[02:22:17.441 --> 02:22:21.645]  What do you think is in store for our society?
[02:22:22.005 --> 02:22:22.746]  What is your
[02:22:24.101 --> 02:22:25.724]  No, I don't want to say conservative.
[02:22:25.804 --> 02:22:28.949]  I don't want to say realistic.
[02:22:29.149 --> 02:22:31.513]  What is your realistic view for what's going to happen?
[02:22:32.409 --> 02:22:33.629]  The elite's going to get worse and worse.
[02:22:33.650 --> 02:22:36.210]  They're going to have more and more petty laws to get more people in the system.
[02:22:36.791 --> 02:22:42.473]  There's going to be more and more wars, more and more terror attack staged by the New World Order as they ratchet down control.
[02:22:42.513 --> 02:22:43.933]  It's a scientific dictatorship.
[02:22:44.354 --> 02:22:45.594]  They understand what makes us tick.
[02:22:45.894 --> 02:22:47.655]  They play us like a fiddle.
[02:22:48.375 --> 02:22:55.378]  And I see them getting us more and more herded into compact control grids and having released controlled bioweapon releases that get worse
[02:22:56.078 --> 02:23:02.140]  You know, each one, as they tighten things down, always in the name of keeping us safe, until they've killed the vast majority of us.
[02:23:02.601 --> 02:23:13.165]  That is their public plan, and my God, it's horrific, but that's really... And they want to kill the vast majority of us because, supposedly, there's too many human beings, and we have an overpopulation problem.
[02:23:13.185 --> 02:23:23.429]  Which they can even argue is true, but then when you read, back in the sixties, they said, in the Club of Rome, and then in the Royal Commission on Human Rights in the fifties, out of Britain, they said,
[02:23:24.409 --> 02:23:32.658]  We're actually going to let the third world overpopulate as a weapon to keep them down, and then not let them get new technologies, and then we'll just kill the mass of them later.
[02:23:33.259 --> 02:23:35.141]  So, it's, man, it's cold-blooded.
[02:23:35.521 --> 02:23:41.888]  The worst stuff you can imagine, the most horrible, cold-blooded thing you can imagine, you imagine that, that's what they're doing.
[02:23:42.589 --> 02:23:46.592]  I mean, I can usually imagine the evil they're doing, and then I find their own documents saying it later.
[02:23:46.612 --> 02:23:58.361]  You know, like, I'll have this many pieces of the puzzle, and then I can go, well, but the next piece is this, and then when I find that piece, it's not me finding it and trying to cram a square peg in a round hole, I cram, you know, I put it in, it pops in perfectly.
[02:23:58.921 --> 02:24:02.924]  Now, do you think that this result is inevitable, or... Stay there, let's talk about it on air.
[02:24:03.144 --> 02:24:03.625]  Joe, here we go.
[02:24:10.174 --> 02:24:17.880]  Okay, it's kind of helter-skelter crazy how I do this, because I'm doing a behind-the-scenes radio show on the InfoWars streams and then come back to everybody after the break.
[02:24:18.361 --> 02:24:20.363]  More of your calls coming up, I don't know how we're going to get to them all.
[02:24:20.763 --> 02:24:23.905]  Joe Rogan is guest hosting, I guess riding a shotgun with us today.
[02:24:24.186 --> 02:24:32.653]  Joe was asking me a question during the break about what's the master plan, and I said stage more terror, stage bio-attacks, until we're all into herded cities and then wipe out the majority of us.
[02:24:33.033 --> 02:24:33.814]  That's their plan.
[02:24:34.454 --> 02:24:38.179]  That's why I get freaked out by them killing the dollar, or calling for carbon taxes.
[02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:43.587]  It's because everything they said they'd do, they keep doing, and that means they're not deviating from their stated plan.
[02:24:43.847 --> 02:24:46.251]  I keep hoping they stop, or slow down, or quit.
[02:24:46.812 --> 02:24:48.514]  And then, Joe, you were asking another question.
[02:24:48.554 --> 02:24:48.914]  What was it?
[02:24:49.522 --> 02:24:54.827]  Well, I was saying, do you think that it's possible that there's a solution to this in the form of technology?
[02:24:55.187 --> 02:25:08.520]  And do you think that maybe with the access to information that we have now, as it advances and becomes more and more instant, that human beings really will be connected in a much more tangible way than they are now?
[02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:24.331]  That once we have some sort of embedded technology, whether it's a chip in your brain, or whether it's something new that we can't even imagine yet, that allows you to access direct contact with information.
[02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:28.844]  Like, almost like being able to get on the internet without a computer.
[02:25:29.585 --> 02:25:32.467]  Yeah, again, it's a double-edged... Everyone together in this one big grid.
[02:25:33.088 --> 02:25:37.192]  And if that is possible, I mean, look, the internet itself is the craziest idea ever.
[02:25:37.472 --> 02:25:43.719]  So crazy that they never even thought about it for a second on Star Wars or Star Trek or any of those things.
[02:25:43.739 --> 02:25:44.720]  Even though they had it in the 50s.
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:48.063]  Except, well, you know, no one knew what it was, though.
[02:25:48.183 --> 02:25:50.405]  No one knew what it really could be.
[02:25:50.785 --> 02:25:55.229]  No one, even the government, had any idea that the internet could be what it is right now.
[02:25:55.549 --> 02:26:04.095]  This insane, immediate access to information, Google searching, all the different stuff that we have now, websites... Joe, you know what's amazing?
[02:26:04.136 --> 02:26:10.300]  You always keep saying things that are actually things I've studied, and I get the idea you're organically seeing it extrapolated out.
[02:26:10.861 --> 02:26:12.662]  Actually, in 93 declassified
[02:26:13.703 --> 02:26:13.903]  We're good.
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:34.640]  Yeah, I've heard of that.
[02:26:34.660 --> 02:27:00.931]  Where you sleep and look at, well they're gonna, the government's job will be inserting you with this, this is where the Matrix actually came from, and that we'll all be wireheads because the pleasure centers will be, you know the studies with rats thirty years ago where it only punches the pleasure center till it dies, and so, and so whereas that could empower us to all communicate with each other and be free, they're gonna be running the program and only using it to control us so we accept going into the rack and then being killed.
[02:27:01.874 --> 02:27:05.015]  Well, maybe Alex, that really is a form of evolution.
[02:27:05.395 --> 02:27:18.641]  Have you ever thought about the idea that machines and technology and all the things that we use to advance our lives, these things that are constantly improving and constantly being innovated and changed.
[02:27:20.342 --> 02:27:23.343]  But I consciously want to warn people about that danger.
[02:27:23.923 --> 02:27:30.766]  But have you ever thought that these machines are almost like a symbiotic form of life that we share our existence with?
[02:27:31.046 --> 02:27:40.471]  I mean, if you didn't define life as biological, if you didn't define life as something that lives, dies, and rots, and gets eaten by bacteria, and you looked at just cars...
[02:27:41.286 --> 02:27:47.530]  You would look at something that needs humans, because humans have to design it, and humans have to operate it.
[02:27:47.550 --> 02:27:51.252]  But Joe, what I'm saying... I understand what you're saying, but... Humans need these things to move on.
[02:27:51.592 --> 02:28:01.378]  Isn't it possible that it is some sort of a symbiotic form of life, and that we may eventually evolve to the point where we become one with it, and that's our destiny?
[02:28:01.518 --> 02:28:03.859]  Well, that is... That might be what technology is doing, Alex.
[02:28:03.919 --> 02:28:09.727]  That is what the transhumanist, post-humanist believe, and what I'm saying is... Well, maybe that's what their goal is.
[02:28:10.047 --> 02:28:12.070]  Maybe they don't even realize what their purpose is.
[02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.611]  No, no, they do.
[02:28:12.631 --> 02:28:21.103]  Maybe they don't realize that their purpose is to get technology to a point where it can think rationally outside of human emotions and animal instincts.
[02:28:21.403 --> 02:28:23.704]  But the problem is... It's been a real Cylon.
[02:28:23.724 --> 02:28:24.704]  Yes, Cylon invasion.
[02:28:25.104 --> 02:28:32.346]  What they're doing is, though, the globalists are engineering the architecture through their psychopathic mind.
[02:28:32.366 --> 02:28:42.289]  The new life form they're creating, you know, we are creators of the image of God, is a system for dehumanization and control.
[02:28:42.589 --> 02:28:49.672]  So I'm not saying this couldn't be designed to empower... It could be designed to probably empower us, but I'm telling you, look who's building it.
[02:28:50.052 --> 02:28:51.072]  It's being directed by...
[02:28:52.372 --> 02:28:56.073]  I understand what you're saying, and I understand that they're building it for all the wrong reasons.
[02:28:56.373 --> 02:28:59.514]  That what they're doing is for all the wrong reasons, as they are sociopaths.
[02:28:59.874 --> 02:29:00.835]  Absolutely, I understand that.
[02:29:00.895 --> 02:29:02.395]  But, let's look at it this way.
[02:29:02.815 --> 02:29:07.596]  What if there was a species far more evolved than human beings are today?
[02:29:07.916 --> 02:29:11.917]  What if they were 100% loving and 100% honest and 100% aware of each other and communicated with each other, like, instantly?
[02:29:17.779 --> 02:29:19.120]  We need to continue.
[02:29:19.140 --> 02:29:20.501]  I think that other group sounds boring!
[02:29:38.322 --> 02:29:39.622]  And we're going to run them down!
[02:29:39.662 --> 02:29:40.122]  You hear that?
[02:29:40.183 --> 02:29:41.543]  Broadcasting into the galaxy!
[02:29:41.803 --> 02:29:43.463]  We're coming for you, little green man!
[02:29:43.483 --> 02:29:45.764]  We're going to kick your butts out of your bases!
[02:29:45.964 --> 02:29:47.284]  They'll be ours within hours!
[02:29:47.765 --> 02:29:48.505]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:48.525 --> 02:29:49.045]  Stay with us.
[02:29:53.706 --> 02:29:54.606]  We're on the march.
[02:29:55.107 --> 02:29:56.687]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:57.627 --> 02:29:59.508]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.528 --> 02:30:00.288]  Let's continue.
[02:30:01.188 --> 02:30:02.729]  Joe, this is an insane discussion.
[02:30:03.169 --> 02:30:03.909]  It's fine, man.
[02:30:04.761 --> 02:30:08.118]  No, I think people... I feel like I'm on acid right now.
[02:30:10.123 --> 02:30:11.343]  That's what I feel like every day.
[02:30:11.383 --> 02:30:13.184]  Not that I've ever done that, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:13.524 --> 02:30:14.364]  I hear you, buddy.
[02:30:14.404 --> 02:30:15.544]  Hey, you know me, Joe.
[02:30:15.564 --> 02:30:16.584]  I'm a teetotaler, aren't I?
[02:30:16.845 --> 02:30:17.705]  You are a teetotaler.
[02:30:17.725 --> 02:30:19.305]  You occasionally have a Budweiser.
[02:30:19.365 --> 02:30:20.885]  That's right, but I don't smoke the ganja.
[02:30:21.266 --> 02:30:22.226]  No, you do not, sir.
[02:30:22.346 --> 02:30:23.406]  You should.
[02:30:23.426 --> 02:30:24.246]  It's good for you.
[02:30:24.466 --> 02:30:26.487]  I'm naturally high on my own, Joe.
[02:30:27.547 --> 02:30:28.107]  Well, okay.
[02:30:28.367 --> 02:30:31.148]  Hey, we've all got a different biochemistry.
[02:30:31.528 --> 02:30:33.028]  Let's take some phone calls here.
[02:30:33.048 --> 02:30:33.268]  Sure.
[02:30:33.988 --> 02:30:35.429]  Let's talk to William in California.
[02:30:35.449 --> 02:30:36.449]  You're on the air with Joe Rogan.
[02:30:37.449 --> 02:30:39.571]  Hey, how you guys doing?
[02:30:39.591 --> 02:30:40.311]  Thank you.
[02:30:41.372 --> 02:30:42.152]  Can you hear me?
[02:30:42.393 --> 02:30:42.693]  Yes, sir.
[02:30:42.933 --> 02:30:43.493]  Yeah, we can hear you.
[02:30:43.533 --> 02:30:44.514]  What's up, man?
[02:30:44.534 --> 02:30:49.418]  I just want to have a call to everyone out there to support Alex Jones' money bomb this weekend.
[02:30:51.946 --> 02:30:56.990]  The money bomb is Alex and, you know... You heard about Ron Paul raising all that money on those days?
[02:30:57.930 --> 02:30:59.752]  Um, I heard about Ron Paul, yeah.
[02:31:00.032 --> 02:31:05.696]  The same guys that did that have decided to do a money bomb for me, but obviously the money bomb thing's kind of been used now.
[02:31:05.716 --> 02:31:14.122]  I don't expect it to be that big, but they want to help me, you know, donate money, because I'm not, you know, a big TV star or anything, so we can expand our offices and get better equipment.
[02:31:14.662 --> 02:31:18.285]  I didn't think it up, but everybody's getting behind it, and, you know... We can all support it, though.
[02:31:18.585 --> 02:31:20.427]  I need Joe Rogan to be my sugar daddy.
[02:31:22.067 --> 02:31:24.528]  Now, we all can help out and support you.
[02:31:25.289 --> 02:31:26.229]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:31:26.829 --> 02:31:32.171]  I wanted to ask Joe if he could talk a little bit about the float chamber that he got from Crash this year to everyone.
[02:31:32.872 --> 02:31:33.412]  Oh, yeah.
[02:31:33.452 --> 02:31:34.112]  You know Crash?
[02:31:34.132 --> 02:31:34.793]  How do you know Crash?
[02:31:34.813 --> 02:31:36.613]  Yeah, I know you know me.
[02:31:36.653 --> 02:31:37.233]  I'm William.
[02:31:37.434 --> 02:31:38.254]  I was up at your house.
[02:31:38.894 --> 02:31:40.015]  Oh, what's going on, William?
[02:31:40.135 --> 02:31:41.315]  Okay.
[02:31:41.415 --> 02:31:45.677]  Crash is the guy that designed my new isolation tank.
[02:31:45.737 --> 02:31:48.338]  He's this crazy genius that lives in Venice.
[02:31:48.938 --> 02:32:08.828]  And what, the difference, if you don't know what an isolation tank is, it's a tank that was created by this guy, his name was invented by this guy named John Lilly, who was a psychedelic pioneer from the 70s, and what he wanted to do was figure out a way, he actually invented it in the 50s, he wanted to figure out a way to separate the human body from the influence of sensory input.
[02:32:09.543 --> 02:32:16.827]  And what he, what he designed was a tank that's filled with water that's warm, and it's heated up to the same temperature as the surface of your skin.
[02:32:16.847 --> 02:32:17.107]  The womb!
[02:32:17.167 --> 02:32:18.948]  And it's 800, it's just like the womb.
[02:32:19.129 --> 02:32:23.171]  And there's 800 pounds of salt in that water, so you're incredibly buoyant.
[02:32:23.271 --> 02:32:24.832]  So you, you come off weightless.
[02:32:25.252 --> 02:32:30.355]  And then, you pull the lid shut on this, um, this, this door, and you're in total darkness.
[02:32:30.715 --> 02:32:31.476]  And total silence.
[02:32:31.776 --> 02:32:33.698]  And you have no sensory input coming in.
[02:32:33.738 --> 02:32:37.101]  And because of that, you feel like untethered from your body.
[02:32:37.501 --> 02:32:39.543]  And your brain becomes like supercharged.
[02:32:39.583 --> 02:32:44.567]  And you have these incredible experiences and really introspective moments.
[02:32:44.587 --> 02:32:46.989]  It's DMT again because your body thinks you're asleep.
[02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:49.452]  It's not exactly like DMT.
[02:32:49.572 --> 02:32:51.373]  It doesn't usually get as intense as that.
[02:32:51.694 --> 02:32:55.417]  It's much more like... But I mean, some of the same chemicals, I believe, are being released.
[02:32:55.816 --> 02:33:00.319]  There are some psychedelic chemicals that are being released during this experience.
[02:33:00.579 --> 02:33:07.963]  But, and the other thing about this experience is, the best thing about it is, you know, if you're the type of person that gets freaked out by these kind of things, it ends any time you want to.
[02:33:08.283 --> 02:33:11.205]  It's not like you take mushrooms, you have to wait five hours before you come down.
[02:33:11.565 --> 02:33:13.386]  You just open the door, and then you're fine.
[02:33:13.446 --> 02:33:15.588]  I'm surprised they haven't tried to make that illegal yet.
[02:33:16.088 --> 02:33:20.110]  I know, it's kind of shocking, because it's, uh, it's... I'll tell you what, we're going back on, here we go.
[02:33:20.250 --> 02:33:20.611]  Okay.
[02:33:20.731 --> 02:33:21.191]  Uh, stay there.
[02:33:28.621 --> 02:33:30.122]  Alright, let's go back to Joe Rogan.
[02:33:30.142 --> 02:33:34.446]  He was talking about his century deprivation tank, which is like the experience of the womb.
[02:33:35.287 --> 02:33:39.611]  No drugs involved, you just think you're floating in weightlessness back in the womb.
[02:33:40.191 --> 02:33:41.653]  Altered States, the movie's about that.
[02:33:42.393 --> 02:33:48.257]  And they're inside the salt tank, water and salt, near body temperature.
[02:33:48.837 --> 02:33:55.422]  And Joe, you were talking about the experience because a caller, who I guess is friends with you, William in California, still on with us, was bringing it up.
[02:33:55.462 --> 02:33:55.842]  Go ahead.
[02:33:56.162 --> 02:34:02.206]  I'm actually giving away, I got a new tank design and I'm giving away my old tank online.
[02:34:02.526 --> 02:34:12.992]  If you go to JoeRogan.net and you sign up for my mailing list, at the end of June I'm giving away my isolation tank and I'll have it delivered to your house and someone will set it up.
[02:34:13.192 --> 02:34:14.653]  How often do you get in the tank?
[02:34:14.973 --> 02:34:16.314]  I get in as much as I can.
[02:34:18.074 --> 02:34:19.875]  It's a pretty intense experience.
[02:34:21.116 --> 02:34:26.463]  Sometimes I like to not get in it for a while and just kind of go over all the things I've learned when I've been in there.
[02:34:26.483 --> 02:34:27.725]  So what happens when you're in the tank?
[02:34:27.745 --> 02:34:30.990]  I've never done it.
[02:34:31.010 --> 02:34:33.112]  Well, you're in total sensory deprivation.
[02:34:33.172 --> 02:34:34.214]  You don't feel anything.
[02:34:34.494 --> 02:34:35.556]  You don't see anything.
[02:34:35.836 --> 02:34:36.717]  You don't hear anything.
[02:34:36.737 --> 02:34:38.640]  And the reason being is that you're in this tank.
[02:34:39.020 --> 02:34:40.181]  It's filled with water.
[02:34:40.241 --> 02:34:44.763]  The water is heated to 93.5 degrees, which is the same temperature as the surface of your skin.
[02:34:45.023 --> 02:34:46.923]  So when you're lying in it, you don't feel the water.
[02:34:47.144 --> 02:34:51.465]  Then on top of that, there's 800 pounds of salt in there, which makes you incredibly buoyant.
[02:34:51.705 --> 02:34:55.107]  And then you close the lid on this thing and you're in total silence and total darkness.
[02:34:55.267 --> 02:34:55.647]  I think so.
[02:35:11.064 --> 02:35:12.085]  I've got to have one of these.
[02:35:12.145 --> 02:35:14.266]  I know you've invited me out to use it before.
[02:35:14.286 --> 02:35:15.747]  Next time I'm out in California, I've got to come.
[02:35:16.187 --> 02:35:17.968]  If you'll be gracious enough, let me get in the tank.
[02:35:18.048 --> 02:35:18.368]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:35:18.408 --> 02:35:21.350]  I'm sure there's a place where you can rent one and use it in Austin.
[02:35:21.430 --> 02:35:25.772]  If you Google where to float, if you go and you Google that, there's a website.
[02:35:25.792 --> 02:35:27.133]  Two hours later, I'm in one.
[02:35:27.153 --> 02:35:29.214]  Yeah, literally, man.
[02:35:29.354 --> 02:35:30.975]  I'm kind of afraid to get in one, man.
[02:35:31.015 --> 02:35:32.416]  I'm already pretty whacked out.
[02:35:32.896 --> 02:35:40.243]  Well, it'll definitely be eye-opening, because a lot of people run from reality, and when you get in an isolation tank, there's nowhere to run.
[02:35:40.523 --> 02:35:44.307]  You might not even think you run from reality, but there might be something you're running from.
[02:35:44.327 --> 02:35:44.787]  That's it!
[02:35:44.907 --> 02:35:47.610]  I'm gonna get in one, and I'm gonna report back what happened.
[02:35:47.890 --> 02:35:48.711]  Please do, man.
[02:35:49.151 --> 02:35:51.752]  It's a very intense, natural, psychedelic experience.
[02:35:51.812 --> 02:35:54.354]  And I think psychedelic experiences are good for everybody.
[02:35:54.674 --> 02:35:59.296]  But I think a lot of people, rightly so, a lot of people are afraid of drugs.
[02:35:59.737 --> 02:36:01.458]  Because there's a lot of dangerous drugs.
[02:36:01.498 --> 02:36:02.238]  Oh, that was the thing.
[02:36:02.278 --> 02:36:02.978]  DMT.
[02:36:03.018 --> 02:36:07.821]  Now, you've had good experiences with this naturally occurring chemical, Joe, that you've taken.
[02:36:08.962 --> 02:36:10.923]  Other people, though, some people have bad experiences.
[02:36:11.363 --> 02:36:18.886]  Well, the experiences that people are having, the reason why they're having bad experiences, so-called bad, is because they can't handle the experience.
[02:36:19.226 --> 02:36:20.647]  The experience is mind-blowing.
[02:36:20.907 --> 02:36:22.147]  Terrence McKenna said it best.
[02:36:22.447 --> 02:36:26.489]  He said that it's almost possible that you could die from astonishment.
[02:36:27.739 --> 02:36:44.703]  Now, let's be clear, this all came from the military, and now... Well, it didn't come from the military, it's been used by the Amazons, and... No, I'm in our modern... I'm in our modern... Yes, well, it was... I don't know the exact history of it, or I don't recall... Well, let me tell people the history.
[02:36:44.723 --> 02:36:57.186]  I believe it was synthesized in 1931, and I think they... there's a bunch of people that went down to the Amazon, and they brought this stuff back, and they initially called it telepathy.
[02:36:57.975 --> 02:37:06.259]  Because one of the chemicals in one of the plants, they labeled it telepathine because it literally allowed people to telepathically communicate.
[02:37:06.559 --> 02:37:11.601]  Then they realized that this chemical that they labeled telepathine was actually already labeled.
[02:37:11.661 --> 02:37:12.801]  It was called harmine.
[02:37:13.202 --> 02:37:17.503]  So through the rules of scientific nomenclature, the original name stuck.
[02:37:17.583 --> 02:37:21.265]  But they tried to name it telepathine after they figured out what it did.
[02:37:21.465 --> 02:37:24.787]  Well, let me go back and comment on that, Joe, since you raised it.
[02:37:24.807 --> 02:37:30.551]  I mean, you know LSD was big in the 40s with the Skull and Bones crowd, the owners of Time, Life, Books, others.
[02:37:30.992 --> 02:37:40.198]  They were taking it, and then they decided to give it to the college kids, so they put the ingredient list out, you know, black sedans pulling up, the CIA put it all over the U.S.
[02:37:40.558 --> 02:37:41.539]  Well, where are they now?
[02:37:41.599 --> 02:37:42.880]  We need some acid right now.
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:43.720]  It would help everybody.
[02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:46.042]  Tell those guys to go back to work.
[02:37:46.641 --> 02:37:51.344]  Well, they thought it'd be used to control people, then they decided it was actually freeing people's minds, so they banned it.
[02:37:51.585 --> 02:37:57.369]  So now all there is is the toxic, dirty junk that's out there from people having to mix too many chemicals to get the same thing.
[02:37:57.989 --> 02:38:07.056]  But yes, I mean, the first time I heard... Well, that's the crazy thing, Alex, about DMT, is that you really can't stop the source of it, because it's in so many different plants.
[02:38:07.156 --> 02:38:08.157]  It's in grass.
[02:38:08.657 --> 02:38:10.038]  It's in Filaris grass.
[02:38:10.058 --> 02:38:11.379]  It's a very common grass.
[02:38:11.792 --> 02:38:16.557]  You can, there's many, many plants that you can find online that contain this chemical.
[02:38:16.878 --> 02:38:23.225]  And DMT is like, the way I describe it is like mushrooms times a million plus aliens.
[02:38:23.765 --> 02:38:27.329]  I mean, it is the most mind-blowing psychedelic experience.
[02:38:27.669 --> 02:38:29.652]  You will never... What happens metabolically?
[02:38:29.692 --> 02:38:31.554]  What happens to the heart rate and things when you're on this?
[02:38:31.994 --> 02:38:34.877]  Well, you know, it can be dangerous if you have high blood pressure.
[02:38:34.897 --> 02:38:43.687]  One of the things that they found, um, that was a little scary during the, uh, DNP experiences, where the people's blood pressure would go through the roof because they would freak out.
[02:38:43.907 --> 02:38:48.352]  But it's really because you're, I mean, like McKenna said, that you're almost dying of astonishment.
[02:38:48.892 --> 02:38:57.225]  You know, astonishment is a big theme in the DMT experience, and when you go over there, one of the first things that these DMT speakers... Listen, I'm already, I'm already in that.
[02:38:57.245 --> 02:39:03.134]  One of the first, hold on a minute, one of the first things they try to communicate with you is to try to not give into that astonishment.
[02:39:04.511 --> 02:39:07.172]  They literally say to you, do not give in to astonishment.
[02:39:07.352 --> 02:39:21.737]  And this is something that McKenna had said, and when I experienced it, it was like I was hearing his words bounce back to me from these creatures as if they knew that I had read all McKenna's stuff, that I was preparing for this.
[02:39:22.057 --> 02:39:24.318]  It's the craziest experience ever.
[02:39:24.598 --> 02:39:28.039]  You're talking to, like, ultimate wisdom, ultimate love.
[02:39:28.599 --> 02:39:38.743]  And just intelligence so beyond your grasp that you can't even really... It's like flying through your brain and you're trying to grab hold of it as it's passing.
[02:39:38.763 --> 02:39:40.044]  What do these creatures look like?
[02:39:40.544 --> 02:39:41.584]  They don't look like anything.
[02:39:41.604 --> 02:39:42.505]  They look like everything.
[02:39:42.885 --> 02:39:45.746]  They look like everything there is all together all at once.
[02:39:46.106 --> 02:39:51.088]  The way I would describe it, like I said before, it's like complex geometric patterns that are made out of love.
[02:39:51.668 --> 02:39:55.329]  But the crazy thing about it, it doesn't seem like they're creatures.
[02:39:55.629 --> 02:39:58.710]  It seems like what you're communicating with is everything.
[02:39:59.110 --> 02:40:02.131]  It's like you're communicating with the wiring under the board.
[02:40:02.411 --> 02:40:04.291]  You're communicating with the code.
[02:40:04.531 --> 02:40:05.932]  You're communicating with God.
[02:40:05.972 --> 02:40:07.132]  You're in the electricity.
[02:40:07.152 --> 02:40:08.672]  You're traveling through the electricity.
[02:40:08.992 --> 02:40:10.293]  You are the electricity.
[02:40:10.333 --> 02:40:11.173]  You're everything.
[02:40:11.553 --> 02:40:14.534]  Everything is all together all at once.
[02:40:15.354 --> 02:40:16.635]  Mind-boggling!
[02:40:16.935 --> 02:40:21.659]  And when you come down from it, when you come back to reality, it's very difficult to assimilate.
[02:40:21.859 --> 02:40:25.342]  And I think that's one of the reasons why you forget about it so quickly.
[02:40:25.362 --> 02:40:32.707]  Now, have you videotaped yourself while, after, like, because you don't remember what's going on, while it's happening, have you videotaped yourself while this is going on?
[02:40:33.008 --> 02:40:36.410]  No, I videotaped, I've turned on the video camera and talked about it after it's over.
[02:40:36.490 --> 02:40:37.351]  Why not do it during?
[02:40:37.611 --> 02:40:38.652]  Because nothing happens.
[02:40:38.772 --> 02:40:40.013]  You just sit with your eyes closed.
[02:40:40.356 --> 02:40:41.577]  Yes, you just sit there on the couch.
[02:40:41.597 --> 02:40:45.662]  Yeah, you just melt into the couch and then when it's over you come back.
[02:40:46.022 --> 02:40:49.166]  I would not recommend this to anybody who's not stable.
[02:40:49.546 --> 02:40:58.617]  I would not recommend this to anybody who is a paranoid person or a person who's very sensitive or gets very emotional.
[02:40:58.657 --> 02:40:59.297]  I'm not getting near it.
[02:41:00.979 --> 02:41:13.204]  It's so earth-shattering that you have to have a very good foundation in terra firma, a very good... Well, see, I have that, Joe, but I'm also already so sensitive, and I don't want to get into it.
[02:41:13.224 --> 02:41:14.524]  Well, it would be good for you, man.
[02:41:14.804 --> 02:41:16.105]  It wouldn't be a bad thing for you.
[02:41:16.165 --> 02:41:23.848]  And if they're correct, if these people that believe that it happens during REM sleep, that it happens when we die, if they're correct, you're going to experience it whether you like it or not.
[02:41:24.168 --> 02:41:26.589]  And maybe what it is, is having a
[02:41:26.869 --> 02:41:27.409]  We're good to go.
[02:41:51.091 --> 02:41:51.832]  Let me say this, Sean.
[02:42:12.551 --> 02:42:16.435]  Let me say this, and again, I'm not advocating using this chemical that's naturally in your brain.
[02:42:16.455 --> 02:42:17.676]  Obviously, like you said, it's very dangerous.
[02:42:17.977 --> 02:42:19.358]  Well, you can get it through yoga!
[02:42:19.659 --> 02:42:22.782]  You can reach this point, supposedly, through kundalini yoga.
[02:42:23.182 --> 02:42:25.625]  That's what the practice of kundalini yoga is all about.
[02:42:25.685 --> 02:42:26.566]  Let me just go back, though.
[02:42:27.507 --> 02:42:28.528]  I'm just putting out that warning.
[02:42:30.530 --> 02:42:32.891]  But I have to say, you know, we kind of fell out of touch.
[02:42:32.911 --> 02:42:37.233]  You're busy, I'm busy, and I think you've changed from when I first knew you nine, ten years ago.
[02:42:37.253 --> 02:42:47.618]  I mean, you weren't bad then, you were a nice, smart guy then, but Joe, I think you're more articulate now, and you were always articulate, but I think you have changed, you know, towards the positive.
[02:42:47.638 --> 02:42:49.959]  Do you think that this chemical's done that to you?
[02:42:51.061 --> 02:43:00.559]  100%.
[02:42:51.882 --> 02:43:00.559]  All of the psychedelic experiences I've had, whether they've been the natural ones, like the isolation tank, or whether they've been from mushrooms, or DMT experiences, or cannabis...
[02:43:01.082 --> 02:43:04.886]  Any of the different psychedelic experiences that I've had have changed me for the better, 100%.
[02:43:05.627 --> 02:43:12.413]  They've made me more honest, they've made me more aware, they've made me more humble, infinitely more humble.
[02:43:12.674 --> 02:43:16.197]  The better and the better I get at everything in life, the more humble I get.
[02:43:16.257 --> 02:43:17.959]  That's another thing that I've realized.
[02:43:18.019 --> 02:43:22.023]  The better I get at comedy, the more I don't even feel like I'm doing what I'm doing.
[02:43:22.403 --> 02:43:24.225]  When I do comedy, it feels like I'm like,
[02:43:24.445 --> 02:43:24.805]  I'm good.
[02:43:42.388 --> 02:43:47.552]  It's only good when you're free of the ego, and that's what psychedelic experiences are all about.
[02:43:47.853 --> 02:43:49.634]  It's all about abandoning the ego.
[02:43:49.954 --> 02:44:01.103]  It's all about letting go of all your predetermined ideas and predetermined patterns of behavior and seeing this whole experience for what it really is, which is mind-boggling.
[02:44:01.423 --> 02:44:07.108]  The layers upon layers upon layers that exist in this existence right now that you and I
[02:44:07.748 --> 02:44:09.369]  Both living and are fascinating.
[02:44:09.609 --> 02:44:10.469]  Let me tell you something, man.
[02:44:10.529 --> 02:44:12.710]  I really learned that watching my daughter being born.
[02:44:13.130 --> 02:44:14.551]  Holy cow!
[02:44:15.371 --> 02:44:17.232]  You have three children now, Alex?
[02:44:17.392 --> 02:44:17.672]  Yes.
[02:44:18.072 --> 02:44:19.133]  Mind-boggling!
[02:44:19.533 --> 02:44:30.537]  You think that you know what it's like to see a person come out of a person, but when you actually are there and you see yourself, a creation of your genetics, come out of another
[02:44:30.717 --> 02:44:31.738]  No, it's all heavy duty.
[02:44:31.798 --> 02:44:32.878]  It's all incredible.
[02:44:32.958 --> 02:44:33.959]  But that's it, Joe.
[02:44:33.999 --> 02:44:38.962]  For me, these people are obsessed with material or acting cool, and that's how it is for me.
[02:44:39.042 --> 02:44:43.885]  More and more of my ego is just gone, and I just walk around looking at trees and cars and the sun and people.
[02:44:43.905 --> 02:44:45.186]  That's how you're supposed to be, man.
[02:44:45.226 --> 02:44:46.887]  That's how you're supposed to be beautiful.
[02:44:46.967 --> 02:44:50.649]  But I mean, I see a fat woman as beautiful just because it's a creature, and exactly.
[02:44:50.769 --> 02:44:55.672]  See, I don't need hallucinogens because everything is just so weird already to me.
[02:44:56.212 --> 02:44:57.233]  Well, it is, man.
[02:44:57.273 --> 02:45:09.345]  If you're paying attention, life is infinitely... There's another quote that... I forget who the dude was that said it, but he said, not only is life stranger than you suppose, it's stranger than you can suppose.
[02:45:10.089 --> 02:45:12.090]  And that's a brilliant quote to whoever said it.
[02:45:12.110 --> 02:45:12.690]  I don't know what it was.
[02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:13.230]  But that's it.
[02:45:13.330 --> 02:45:14.151]  It's really true.
[02:45:14.411 --> 02:45:20.134]  I feel blasted when I think about my one existence in this incredible beauty.
[02:45:20.174 --> 02:45:25.256]  I realize even after I'm gone, life goes on, and that I was part of that larger continuum.
[02:45:25.676 --> 02:45:27.417]  And it's not even a scary thought.
[02:45:27.457 --> 02:45:34.260]  It's more like I'm opening up to the whole universe, and at the same time, it's just so gripping.
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:43.868]  And then I see these petty people who want petty temporal power and petty power here in this plane, and it's like a joke!
[02:45:45.409 --> 02:45:47.171]  Yeah, it is like a joke.
[02:45:47.191 --> 02:45:48.692]  That's what most people are.
[02:45:48.772 --> 02:45:51.114]  Most people live their life like gigantic children.
[02:45:51.693 --> 02:45:57.341]  You know, and that's what I was talking about earlier when I was saying that it's almost like there's like a mathematical program to life.
[02:45:57.741 --> 02:46:09.197]  It's almost like we need all these different lemmings, and we need all these different silly people that join cults and believe in crazy religions and support the government no matter how atrocious their behavior is.
[02:46:09.654 --> 02:46:19.765]  And we need people who are the head of industry to be sociopaths, and we need people who are, you know, people like Deepak Chopra who are spiritually enlightened to show us a new way.
[02:46:20.045 --> 02:46:24.390]  It's almost like this is just a gigantic program that's moving towards some ultimate goal.
[02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:25.251]  That's a
[02:46:45.871 --> 02:46:48.092]  That's a great way to describe it, a giant work of art.
[02:46:48.312 --> 02:46:54.896]  But it's possible, Alex, that we do have free will, but that free will may be a part of the program.
[02:46:55.156 --> 02:47:00.879]  I mean, it may all be what motivates us to ultimately pursue our natural intention.
[02:47:00.919 --> 02:47:06.242]  Well, I'm just telling you, creatures that can have a dream that comes true exactly, that's a creature that can create.
[02:47:06.842 --> 02:47:07.303]  Absolutely.
[02:47:07.323 --> 02:47:08.523]  Well, we obviously can.
[02:47:08.743 --> 02:47:10.124]  Look at the world we live in.
[02:47:10.204 --> 02:47:11.225]  Look at what we've created.
[02:47:11.245 --> 02:47:13.446]  Look at what we're talking on the phone right now.
[02:47:13.466 --> 02:47:14.947]  We're talking through creation.
[02:47:15.487 --> 02:47:25.514]  I mean, like I said, this creation, the idea of us communicating on the radio is way crazier than the idea of someone being able to see a reality before it happens.
[02:47:25.935 --> 02:47:32.199]  That's just, the only thing that's crazy about the ability to see the future like you have in your dreams is that we don't do it every day.
[02:47:32.259 --> 02:47:33.560]  That's all that's crazy about that.
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:37.363]  If you look at what that is, that's not nearly as if you're not affecting things.
[02:47:37.583 --> 02:47:43.487]  What we're doing right now, you and I are communicating instantaneously with millions of people.
[02:47:43.647 --> 02:47:44.907]  And that creates the ripples.
[02:47:45.007 --> 02:47:52.529]  Not only that, people are going to get a hold of this tape, they're going to put it on YouTube, and it's going to hit millions and millions more people, and they're going to tell their friends about it.
[02:47:52.569 --> 02:47:53.569]  Listen to what they're talking about.
[02:47:53.769 --> 02:47:54.570]  How crazy is this?
[02:47:54.770 --> 02:48:03.932]  And then these ideas that we're talking about right now are going to be introduced to people that would never have thought of this all over the world, and it's going to change the way they think about things.
[02:48:04.272 --> 02:48:07.993]  And then they're not going to care what their bosses mean to them, because the boss has got the problem.
[02:48:08.173 --> 02:48:15.235]  They're not going to care if they're not as, quote, beautiful, according to Madison Avenue, because it's the beautiful mind, it's what's going on inside their head.
[02:48:15.455 --> 02:48:16.155]  You're absolutely right.
[02:48:16.195 --> 02:48:16.755]  Here's the deal.
[02:48:16.775 --> 02:48:17.996]  We've got like 20 phone calls.
[02:48:18.336 --> 02:48:21.477]  I'm going to skip this break and go to the end of the show with Joe.
[02:48:21.757 --> 02:48:22.817]  I've got to have Joe back sooner.
[02:48:22.857 --> 02:48:23.697]  This has been incredible.
[02:48:23.897 --> 02:48:28.158]  This is a different Joe Rogan than the one I interviewed six and a half years ago on air, and he was a great guy then.
[02:48:28.698 --> 02:48:30.299]  Let's go ahead, and who's up next here?
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:33.222]  Let's talk to Carl in Montreal, Canada.
[02:48:33.242 --> 02:48:34.223]  You're on the air with Joe Rogan.
[02:48:34.663 --> 02:48:36.805]  Hey, great to hear you're on here.
[02:48:36.825 --> 02:48:41.329]  I agree with Alex, what he's doing.
[02:48:41.489 --> 02:48:42.770]  Some things I do disagree.
[02:48:44.144 --> 02:48:46.205]  You know, I believe that we're entering hard times.
[02:48:46.225 --> 02:48:51.709]  It's going to gradually get worse and worse, but I believe, you know, that God, you know, that free will is part of the program.
[02:48:52.189 --> 02:48:53.910]  And the elite's trying to block that right now.
[02:48:54.310 --> 02:49:04.817]  Free will may be part of the program, but my point is that free will may be a part of this giant mathematical program that we look at as, oh, you can change the future.
[02:49:05.117 --> 02:49:12.442]  Maybe it is your design to try to change the future, to see the beauty and the love and the positivity in things.
[02:49:12.622 --> 02:49:12.922]  I think?
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:31.741]  Well, I believe that, you know,
[02:50:00.595 --> 02:50:02.836]  Free will has been, you know, misused by people.
[02:50:02.896 --> 02:50:08.799]  I believe there is a Creator, He gave us free will, but people choose to use that free will, you know, in the wrong way.
[02:50:08.819 --> 02:50:11.300]  And that's what a lot of the problems are, you know?
[02:50:11.620 --> 02:50:16.503]  God gave us a choice of what's right and wrong, and sadly, most people choose to do what's wrong.
[02:50:16.903 --> 02:50:17.143]  I hear you.
[02:50:17.183 --> 02:50:18.064]  I appreciate your call.
[02:50:18.364 --> 02:50:21.725]  Yeah, I mean, the do as thou wilt crowd, that means running over other people.
[02:50:21.785 --> 02:50:26.968]  It's not being their own little power gods, and that's the enemy of true creativity and freedom in God.
[02:50:27.348 --> 02:50:28.949]  Mike and Phyllis, you're on the air with Joe Rogan.
[02:50:31.674 --> 02:50:35.319]  I love the conversation going on.
[02:50:35.539 --> 02:50:37.122]  I thought I'd change it up a little bit.
[02:50:37.382 --> 02:50:39.425]  Joe, what do you think about Kimbo's slice?
[02:50:42.088 --> 02:50:42.828]  What do I think about him?
[02:50:42.888 --> 02:50:43.669]  What about him?
[02:50:44.669 --> 02:50:45.870]  What do you think about him?
[02:50:45.930 --> 02:50:46.810]  His fighting style?
[02:50:47.050 --> 02:50:48.251]  Can we see him in the USA?
[02:50:48.691 --> 02:50:49.892]  Uh, maybe someday, man.
[02:50:50.012 --> 02:50:51.852]  If he gets out of his Elite XC contract.
[02:50:51.872 --> 02:50:52.673]  But I like the dude.
[02:50:52.693 --> 02:50:53.813]  I think he's a badass.
[02:50:53.833 --> 02:50:54.714]  He's fun to watch.
[02:50:55.034 --> 02:50:56.054]  He looks crazy.
[02:50:56.074 --> 02:50:56.775]  His shaved head.
[02:50:56.815 --> 02:50:57.915]  The big crazy beard.
[02:50:58.315 --> 02:50:58.715]  I like him.
[02:50:58.776 --> 02:51:00.116]  I'm a Kimbo Slice fan.
[02:51:01.177 --> 02:51:08.600]  Do you think, uh... Do you think that, like, he's any good, or... Like, all these fighters are trashing on him, so...
[02:51:09.393 --> 02:51:10.374]  Ah, you know what, man?
[02:51:10.434 --> 02:51:12.636]  People are always going to trash someone and get a lot of attention.
[02:51:13.197 --> 02:51:14.558]  Kimbo gets a lot of attention right now.
[02:51:14.598 --> 02:51:16.499]  His success is taking a shot at him.
[02:51:16.940 --> 02:51:27.189]  Yeah, whenever you, whenever someone breaks through and starts getting a lot of attention, you know, there's always going to be people that don't think he deserves it, especially if it happened quickly, like with Kimbo.
[02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:29.751]  You know, he just fought some people on YouTube and then bang!
[02:51:30.171 --> 02:51:36.697]  You know, instantly, you know, he's famous and he's all over CBS and people are like, I've been fighting for 10 years and this is ridiculous.
[02:51:36.957 --> 02:51:40.498]  Oh, listen, I've got other talk shows calling me up and gloving around for 20 years.
[02:51:40.598 --> 02:51:41.198]  I hate you.
[02:51:41.479 --> 02:51:42.339]  You're a criminal.
[02:51:42.639 --> 02:51:43.799]  Just because they're jealous.
[02:51:44.199 --> 02:51:45.400]  They'll even admit they're jealous.
[02:51:45.440 --> 02:51:46.280]  Jealous of what?
[02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:48.041]  I mean, I'm trying to wake people up.
[02:51:48.061 --> 02:51:54.103]  This isn't about some... And that's another thing is, I never grew up being jealous and envious and things like that, unless it was over women.
[02:51:54.123 --> 02:51:55.763]  I did have that mating instinct.
[02:51:59.005 --> 02:52:02.327]  I hate it when people operate with me on a level of jealousy or envy.
[02:52:02.767 --> 02:52:08.750]  I'm only wanting to continue my mission, but I refuse to let other people dominate and control me.
[02:52:10.124 --> 02:52:11.625]  And I mean, Joe, I know you're the same way.
[02:52:11.665 --> 02:52:20.729]  You don't have people trying to put their thumb on you, and then I hate the aggression that brings out in me when somebody tries to beat me, and then I crush them.
[02:52:20.769 --> 02:52:21.409]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:52:21.869 --> 02:52:22.829]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[02:52:23.250 --> 02:52:26.631]  I mean, that's what forces competition, though.
[02:52:27.111 --> 02:52:30.513]  I mean, that aggression, that male instinct is what forces competition.
[02:52:30.893 --> 02:52:35.815]  I mean, if the world was filled with loving, powerful people, we'd be living in a field getting rained on.
[02:52:36.155 --> 02:52:36.635]  Exactly.
[02:52:36.695 --> 02:52:37.315]  No, I agree.
[02:52:37.356 --> 02:52:44.318]  It's exactly that dynamism, that aggression, but it has to be controlled as a limited weapon you deploy only when you need it.
[02:52:44.558 --> 02:52:47.239]  Instead, you have these aberrations that are just, RAAAGH!
[02:52:47.259 --> 02:52:47.799]  Just crushing you!
[02:52:47.819 --> 02:52:52.481]  The real problem, Alex, is that there's not a workbook or a guidebook to how to live life.
[02:52:52.841 --> 02:52:59.544]  The real problem is that when people are confronted with all sorts of emotions and jealousy and problems,
[02:52:59.844 --> 02:53:15.570]  There's not something that's there that can show them, whether it's a, you know, like a, I don't want to say a government institution, but like some sort of a cultural institution that explains to human beings what is going on with their behavior.
[02:53:15.610 --> 02:53:21.792]  Well, we've had that with all these fake religions, and then they all fight with each other, you know, trying to claim who's got the best handbooks.
[02:53:21.832 --> 02:53:22.713]  You get 20,000 denominations.
[02:53:24.053 --> 02:53:25.273]  Yeah, that is the problem.
[02:53:25.313 --> 02:53:30.395]  There's a bunch of people showing that they have the idea of how to fix things, when really they don't.
[02:53:30.555 --> 02:53:31.296]  Okay, anything else?
[02:53:31.716 --> 02:53:32.456]  Oh, thanks Mike.
[02:53:32.836 --> 02:53:35.117]  Let's talk to Ray in Texas.
[02:53:35.217 --> 02:53:36.197]  Ray, go ahead in Texas.
[02:53:37.638 --> 02:53:40.459]  Hey, I have an experience I just want to relay real quick.
[02:53:41.139 --> 02:53:51.643]  I was over at Home Depot here in Austin, and there was a woman who had set up a booth in front of the Office Depot, and it said there, and I walked in, I bought some things, came out,
[02:53:52.265 --> 02:53:56.409]  And then she asked me if I was interested if I had any little ones.
[02:53:57.370 --> 02:53:57.810]  And I said no.
[02:53:58.530 --> 02:54:03.795]  And as I was scanning about the table, this ID card jumped out at me.
[02:54:03.875 --> 02:54:04.996]  It was a Dare ID card.
[02:54:05.096 --> 02:54:05.937]  Hey, stop right there.
[02:54:05.957 --> 02:54:07.178]  We're going to come back and talk about it right now.
[02:54:07.238 --> 02:54:07.879]  Main transmission.
[02:54:07.899 --> 02:54:08.159]  Here we go.
[02:54:11.949 --> 02:54:14.273]  Look, I've had Joe Rogan on for 2 hours and 50 minutes.
[02:54:14.293 --> 02:54:15.696]  We're going to let him go in 5 minutes.
[02:54:15.716 --> 02:54:17.900]  This live broadcast is going to end.
[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:20.685]  But I promise, we'll have Joe Rogan back up.
[02:54:20.745 --> 02:54:23.691]  Amazing, mind-blowing interview with Joe Rogan.
[02:54:25.131 --> 02:54:32.195]  We were talking to a caller who just, in the behind-the-scenes Prison Planet.tv viewers, who was talking about he was at Home Depot, came outside, they had a D.A.R.E.
[02:54:32.235 --> 02:54:32.636]  program.
[02:54:32.896 --> 02:54:33.636]  He saw a D.A.R.E.
[02:54:33.716 --> 02:54:34.156]  card.
[02:54:34.597 --> 02:54:40.340]  For those who don't know, they enroll all the kids in Austin and all over the country in Tattletale programs, how to tattle on your parents.
[02:54:40.580 --> 02:54:43.382]  That's in my film, Road to Tyranny, that I made six years ago.
[02:54:44.102 --> 02:54:45.403]  Go ahead and tell your story quickly, sir.
[02:54:46.604 --> 02:54:52.507]  Okay, so I was on the way out of the store there, and she had asked me if I was interested in what was going on there.
[02:54:52.548 --> 02:54:54.869]  And I scanned about her table, and there were various things there.
[02:54:55.356 --> 02:54:57.338]  And I saw an ID card for children.
[02:54:57.378 --> 02:54:57.958]  I looked at it.
[02:54:57.978 --> 02:55:01.041]  It was very colorful and had a, you know, little symbols and things on it.
[02:55:01.641 --> 02:55:04.163]  And, um, I asked her, what was this all about?
[02:55:05.244 --> 02:55:08.547]  And, um, she went on to tell me, well, this is the most important thing on the table.
[02:55:08.567 --> 02:55:12.891]  And here's why, um, on the back here, you have the ability.
[02:55:13.411 --> 02:55:22.639]  And I mean, I, I, I don't know if it was a billionaire option or what, we didn't get into that kind of detail, but to sign away your power of attorney for medical emergencies.
[02:55:23.228 --> 02:55:24.449]  And by the way, they perform emergency care on kids.
[02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:25.029]  They don't need that.
[02:55:25.049 --> 02:55:27.010]  That now means the state can do stuff to your kids.
[02:55:27.070 --> 02:55:27.550]  Unbelievable.
[02:55:27.570 --> 02:55:28.491]  And was this DARE for kids?
[02:55:46.963 --> 02:55:47.704]  It was there.
[02:55:47.824 --> 02:55:51.949]  It was the dare I grew up with, but I guess they're into these other things.
[02:55:52.009 --> 02:55:57.435]  Yeah, that's the thing, Joe, is they're hiring millions of Americans to be secret police, tattletale spies.
[02:55:57.816 --> 02:56:00.459]  They're taking people's kids for no reason.
[02:56:00.519 --> 02:56:02.922]  I mean, government is just out of control, Joe Rogan.
[02:56:03.962 --> 02:56:09.665]  Well, I think anything that has too much power is subject to be out of control.
[02:56:10.086 --> 02:56:12.287]  You know, and the government has too much power, for sure.
[02:56:12.707 --> 02:56:14.608]  I mean, we're seeing that everywhere we look.
[02:56:14.928 --> 02:56:15.949]  We're seeing that with...
[02:56:17.248 --> 02:56:18.009]  Excuse me?
[02:56:18.209 --> 02:56:23.432]  I'm sorry, but here is an instance where we're talking about inflating people by their own will.
[02:56:23.772 --> 02:56:29.536]  You could go ahead and sign away your power of attorney, and then you're under Admiralty and there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:56:29.636 --> 02:56:31.738]  Man, I wish you'd have gotten me some info on that.
[02:56:31.818 --> 02:56:32.838]  Email me some info on that.
[02:56:32.858 --> 02:56:33.719]  That's amazing, Ray.
[02:56:33.979 --> 02:56:34.760]  We've got to move fast.
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:37.001]  Jesse in Canada, from the Genesis Line.
[02:56:37.041 --> 02:56:37.582]  You're on the air.
[02:56:37.622 --> 02:56:37.982]  Go ahead.
[02:56:40.250 --> 02:56:41.530]  Go ahead, Jesse, in Canada.
[02:56:41.550 --> 02:56:42.471]  You're on the air.
[02:56:42.651 --> 02:56:43.791]  Oh, hey, Joe.
[02:56:44.051 --> 02:56:45.192]  Congrats on the new baby.
[02:56:45.552 --> 02:56:46.032]  Thank you, man.
[02:56:46.552 --> 02:56:47.652]  And nice fanny pack.
[02:56:47.833 --> 02:56:48.913]  Just thought I'd say that.
[02:56:50.233 --> 02:57:05.418]  And I was wondering, Dr. Rick Strassman, he said he believes that plants are conscious, and that the DMT and ayahuasca use that is rising, that it may be plants communicating with us.
[02:57:05.819 --> 02:57:06.779]  What do you think about that?
[02:57:07.677 --> 02:57:08.638]  It's very possible.
[02:57:08.658 --> 02:57:09.458]  I mean, why not?
[02:57:09.478 --> 02:57:18.542]  I mean, we think that communication is limited to making noises with our mouths and typing things on keyboards and writing things on paper, but why?
[02:57:18.942 --> 02:57:20.803]  That's just like we were talking about before.
[02:57:20.823 --> 02:57:23.245]  It's just because that's all we're comfortable with.
[02:57:23.285 --> 02:57:25.526]  That's all we know how to experience.
[02:57:25.906 --> 02:57:34.570]  If you talk to the Amazon natives that brew ayahuasca, when they talk about how they figured out... I mean, there's hundreds of thousands of different plants
[02:57:34.950 --> 02:57:35.210]  Thank you.
[02:57:52.540 --> 02:58:01.731]  I mean, I don't know what happens when you take mushrooms, but I swear to God, it feels like you're communicating with something.
[02:58:02.051 --> 02:58:04.334]  How do you know you're not communicating with the mushroom?
[02:58:04.595 --> 02:58:06.997]  How do you know that's not how it communicates with you?
[02:58:08.479 --> 02:58:10.481]  Hey, Joe Rogan, the main transmission's over.
[02:58:10.521 --> 02:58:12.542]  Let me just say bye to you on the other side here.
[02:58:12.562 --> 02:58:16.025]  To all the networks out there and all the stations, thank you for tuning in the broadcast.
[02:58:16.045 --> 02:58:17.646]  Back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:17.666 --> 02:58:18.287]  to 3 p.m.
[02:58:18.327 --> 02:58:19.588]  Central Standard Time.
[02:58:19.628 --> 02:58:26.013]  Retransmission will start after me and Joe finish up here in about two or three minutes on the other side at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:26.033 --> 02:58:32.058]  If you missed any of the news I covered in the first hour or all the big guests we've had today, go to InfoWars.com to listen there.
[02:58:32.378 --> 02:58:34.000]  If not, I'll be back tomorrow on the radio.
[02:58:34.260 --> 02:58:35.120]  God bless you all.
[02:58:35.181 --> 02:58:36.341]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:42.557 --> 02:58:44.498]  Hey, John Harmon, great job, Viacon Diaz.
[02:58:44.938 --> 02:58:45.478]  Thank you, sir.
[02:58:45.758 --> 02:58:51.540]  And I know that we're on Joe's line, so I'm going to say bye to him right now before you dial in to the other hosts.
[02:58:51.880 --> 02:58:57.322]  Joe, I just really want to thank you for coming on, and we're still on air right now on the internet.
[02:58:57.842 --> 02:59:01.043]  I really appreciate you spending all this time with me.
[02:59:02.084 --> 02:59:02.604]  Thanks, buddy.
[02:59:02.624 --> 02:59:03.424]  Thanks for having me on, man.
[02:59:03.444 --> 02:59:04.164]  I had a good time.
[02:59:04.585 --> 02:59:05.525]  Well, it's just amazing.
[02:59:05.565 --> 02:59:06.485]  JoeRogan.net.
[02:59:06.565 --> 02:59:11.227]  And let me have you back in a month or so when I have that fellow on about the JFK deal.
[02:59:11.784 --> 02:59:14.746]  I would love to, because that sounds like the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life.
[02:59:15.707 --> 02:59:19.931]  Just a single bullet theory alone should let people think that there was more than one assassin.
[02:59:20.191 --> 02:59:27.497]  Just the fact that they were willing to pursue such a ridiculous theory should show that there's some sort of a collusion, that there's some sort of a conspiracy.
[02:59:27.617 --> 02:59:29.518]  Well, I hope I didn't burn you out with a three-hour interview.
[02:59:29.538 --> 02:59:31.060]  No, man, I'm never burned out.
[02:59:31.080 --> 02:59:31.880]  I could do this forever.
[02:59:32.080 --> 02:59:32.681]  I know, I know.
[02:59:32.721 --> 02:59:38.506]  Well, listen, I'm going to get you on real soon, and I'm tempted to call you after the show, but I think we've talked enough.
[02:59:38.546 --> 02:59:39.226]  I'll just call you.
[02:59:39.727 --> 02:59:41.008]  Are you going to be around later in the week?
[02:59:41.548 --> 02:59:42.189]  Yeah, sure man.
[02:59:42.209 --> 02:59:42.530]  I'm around.
[02:59:42.590 --> 02:59:43.371]  I'm around all week.
[02:59:53.376 --> 02:59:53.876]  All right, brother.
[02:59:53.896 --> 02:59:54.657]  I appreciate it, too, man.
[02:59:54.677 --> 02:59:55.397]  It was good talking to you.
[02:59:55.457 --> 02:59:56.278]  Hey, that was mind-blowing.
[02:59:56.298 --> 02:59:56.578]  Take care.
[02:59:56.598 --> 02:59:56.878]  Joe Rogan.
[02:59:56.918 --> 02:59:57.519]  It was fun, man.
[02:59:57.559 --> 02:59:57.919]  Take care.
[02:59:58.119 --> 02:59:58.299]  Bye.
[02:59:58.539 --> 02:59:59.680]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:59:59.700 --> 03:00:00.160]  Joe Rogan.
[03:00:00.180 --> 03:00:01.241]  I'm sorry to all the other callers.
[03:00:01.261 --> 03:00:03.762]  I don't have time to get to Scott, Rick, Kid, Nick.
[03:00:03.983 --> 03:00:05.223]  Should I just take these calls right now?
[03:00:05.243 --> 03:00:07.245]  Okay, I'm going to roll through your calls.
[03:00:07.285 --> 03:00:14.569]  You know, Joe had to go because he was on the network line, and I don't want to, you know, abuse his time anymore after three hours.
[03:00:15.270 --> 03:00:16.410]  But we'll just go ahead and go to your calls.
[03:00:16.450 --> 03:00:17.311]  Scott in Colorado.
[03:00:17.651 --> 03:00:19.112]  Sorry you couldn't talk to Joe, but you're on the air.
[03:00:21.413 --> 03:00:21.713]  Go ahead.
[03:00:22.717 --> 03:00:40.056]  I've been listening to you since you were first on Coast to Coast and he calls you the Pit Bull and I want to tell you, you're one of the main reasons I'm being left back to the Lord.
[03:00:40.116 --> 03:00:42.018]  I've never heard a Christian soldier like you.
[03:00:42.875 --> 03:00:43.715]  Well, thank you, my friend.
[03:00:43.735 --> 03:00:47.617]  Well, we're not one of the fake little pulpit prostitutes here.
[03:00:47.657 --> 03:00:52.459]  We love God, but we're certainly not one of these corporate 501c3 churches.
[03:00:52.479 --> 03:00:55.661]  Well, I dig you down deep in the heart and soul, man.
[03:00:56.241 --> 03:01:00.963]  My main reason for calling, when 9-1-1 took place, I was sleeping in that morning.
[03:01:01.484 --> 03:01:05.265]  I got up before I even watched the news and what was happening, and I logged on to the computer.
[03:01:05.666 --> 03:01:10.028]  You know the little AOL windows that are there when you first sign on that tell you the news of the day?
[03:01:10.288 --> 03:01:10.568]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:11.451 --> 03:01:18.457]  There was one on there, and I might be the only person in the world that saw this, that said, Plain Strikes Camp David.
[03:01:19.839 --> 03:01:21.380]  They had a canned story.
[03:01:21.500 --> 03:01:22.361]  I remember hearing that.
[03:01:22.381 --> 03:01:24.043]  It was already written.
[03:01:24.103 --> 03:01:25.684]  It was on the board five minutes later.
[03:01:25.744 --> 03:01:26.044]  Gone.
[03:01:26.305 --> 03:01:28.547]  They were also reporting all day that Building 7 had blown up.
[03:01:28.587 --> 03:01:30.909]  The story was in the can, dude.
[03:01:34.716 --> 03:01:41.238]  Joe, if you're listening, I need you to post some kind of information somewhere about what DMT does to the gut.
[03:01:41.698 --> 03:01:49.520]  I've got a severely bad pancreas, and if it causes any type of... I think DMT only affects the brain, my friend.
[03:01:50.460 --> 03:01:52.480]  Well, I... I'm not advertising DMT.
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:53.381]  Don't take it, folks!
[03:01:53.421 --> 03:01:53.901]  Don't do it!
[03:01:54.681 --> 03:01:58.402]  I don't want to do a bad trip and end up and spill over gut problems.
[03:01:58.582 --> 03:01:58.882]  I hear you.
[03:01:58.942 --> 03:02:00.922]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[03:02:01.262 --> 03:02:02.883]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in Georgia.
[03:02:02.903 --> 03:02:03.443]  Nick, go ahead.
[03:02:04.505 --> 03:02:06.727]  Hey, Alex, uh, Jones, Rogan08.
[03:02:06.787 --> 03:02:17.494]  Uh, I wanted to call and talk to you guys about Kennedy and about Booyahki, but you guys are off in Edge City and now you're talking about DMP and you, uh, kind of wanted me to talk about that.
[03:02:18.195 --> 03:02:19.876]  Um, so let's see here.
[03:02:20.496 --> 03:02:34.226]  Uh, Rogan's talking about Terrence McKenna and, uh, DMP and I just thought I'd throw in that, uh, if he's talking about McKenna, my favorite theory of his is, uh, his book, Fruit of the Gods, where he posits that the, uh, origins of the human religious experience and of human consciousness is actually from, uh,
[03:02:34.861 --> 03:02:37.066]  Uh, Proto-Humans Eating Mushrooms on the African Plains.
[03:02:37.567 --> 03:02:41.616]  And that, uh, this was the, uh, this was an event that brought, actually brought about consciousness.
[03:02:42.277 --> 03:02:43.820]  And, uh, it's just an interesting theory.
[03:02:45.418 --> 03:02:52.703]  Well, I mean, you can watch Blue Jays eating ripened China berries that have alcohol in them, and getting drunk and falling off tree branches.
[03:02:53.103 --> 03:02:58.326]  There's a lot of primate species and things that take drugs, that like to drink.
[03:02:59.687 --> 03:03:03.389]  Most often, berries get fermentation, and there's a lot of animals that like to get intoxicated.
[03:03:04.150 --> 03:03:06.111]  So we're not the only creatures that do it.
[03:03:06.992 --> 03:03:07.652]  No, you're right, you're right.
[03:03:08.072 --> 03:03:12.755]  Okay, listen, I want to talk about Kennedy, and what I really want to do is pick your brain about your new movie.
[03:03:12.875 --> 03:03:13.916]  I was just fascinated about that.
[03:03:14.810 --> 03:03:19.955]  But also, I'm sure you've heard of Judith A. Baker and you've studied her stuff.
[03:03:19.975 --> 03:03:20.695]  What's your take on her?
[03:03:21.656 --> 03:03:23.458]  Ring a bell there, Judith A. Baker?
[03:03:23.679 --> 03:03:25.981]  Yeah, lady says she's Oswald's mistress.
[03:03:27.024 --> 03:03:29.307]  I don't know about her.
[03:03:29.347 --> 03:03:31.208]  You know, I've talked to Marina Oswald.
[03:03:31.709 --> 03:03:32.410]  I've gone over it all.
[03:03:32.470 --> 03:03:35.953]  I just know that you can't shoot somebody in six seconds with three bullets.
[03:03:36.454 --> 03:03:37.955]  I just know you can't shoot to the tree.
[03:03:38.395 --> 03:03:41.298]  I know that you had all these tramps who are well-known CIA guys.
[03:03:41.318 --> 03:03:44.682]  There's now film footage of them there to kill Bobby Kennedy.
[03:03:46.271 --> 03:03:49.054]  Well, Alex, let me tell you, a great angle is, and Judith Barry Baker ties into this whole story,
[03:04:04.346 --> 03:04:06.147]  She relates to the whole Kennedy thing.
[03:04:06.247 --> 03:04:10.709]  No, I know, she's the lady who was in a History Channel special down in New Orleans who dated him.
[03:04:10.769 --> 03:04:16.411]  No, no, but she doesn't talk about it on MinuteTel Kennedy, but she talks about she relates to all of the government special virus cancer program.
[03:04:17.572 --> 03:04:20.333]  Actually, she did on a History Channel show talk about the virus.
[03:04:20.433 --> 03:04:20.753]  Oh, it is?
[03:04:21.373 --> 03:04:25.935]  And she says that Oswald was down in Mexico handing off vials of cancer to a Cuban contact.
[03:04:25.975 --> 03:04:26.996]  No, no, I know who she is.
[03:04:27.076 --> 03:04:30.177]  It just took a minute for it to percolate down and for me to remember.
[03:04:30.197 --> 03:04:30.437]  I hear you.
[03:04:31.077 --> 03:04:32.578]  Yeah, she's still alive, isn't she?
[03:04:33.653 --> 03:04:35.214]  She's in hiding in Amsterdam or something.
[03:04:35.254 --> 03:04:37.796]  She's been traveling around the world trying to hide out.
[03:04:37.856 --> 03:04:38.896]  I think she's still alive.
[03:04:38.996 --> 03:04:39.637]  She may have passed away.
[03:04:44.918 --> 03:04:47.159]  I see other callers on the board, but do we have other calls?
[03:04:47.679 --> 03:04:48.679]  I'm not going to take any more.
[03:04:48.699 --> 03:04:49.360]  I'm just out of time.
[03:04:49.380 --> 03:04:55.682]  I'm exhausted after four hours and five minutes of doing no breaks most of the time.
[03:04:56.602 --> 03:04:57.842]  I am just brain fried now.
[03:04:57.862 --> 03:05:00.783]  I feel like I've had my brain drugged to the dirt.
[03:05:01.143 --> 03:05:08.126]  But it was certainly enlightening and certainly I'll get a lot of hell for having Joe on for all the weird things he was talking about, but life is weird.
[03:05:08.766 --> 03:05:28.014]  And so that's why we had Joe on, and I talk to Joe a few times a year, and he's been so busy, I've been so busy, I haven't really had time to go hang out with him in L.A., but he certainly is an interesting fella, and I'm gonna try to hang out with Joe some more, because he gets more and more interesting, and I appreciate Joe Rogan spending so much time with us today, I appreciate the crew up in Minnesota, appreciate the crew here.
[03:05:28.034 --> 03:05:32.015]  I meant to get Burmess, but hey, I'm gonna have him back on next month, Burmess, you can come on with him then.
[03:05:34.856 --> 03:05:36.477]  Burmess is something else, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:05:38.856 --> 03:05:40.597]  Cheshire Cat smile all the time.
[03:05:43.958 --> 03:05:45.498]  I'm going to go jog in 100 degree heat.
[03:05:45.518 --> 03:05:46.978]  That'll be my DMT for the day.
[03:05:46.998 --> 03:05:55.300]  That'll actually get me, because when I start exercising I have all these wild thoughts and my brain really starts crackling and connections start getting made.
[03:05:55.921 --> 03:05:59.621]  But I will be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m.
[03:05:59.761 --> 03:06:02.122]  to 3 p.m.
[03:06:02.162 --> 03:06:03.042]  Central Standard Time.
[03:06:03.122 --> 03:06:05.963]  More big guest
